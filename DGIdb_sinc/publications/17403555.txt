abstract
neurotoxicity induced by  xxxg178xxx  (ab) involves glutamate toxicity, resulting from overactivation of n-methyl-d-aspartate
(nmda) receptors and elevation of intracellular calcium. however, the heterogeneity of the nmda receptors, frequently composed of nr1 and
 xxxg964xxx -d subunits, has been less studied. thus, we determined the contribution of nmda receptor subtypes on ab1–40 toxicity in hek293 cells
transiently expressing nr1/ xxxg964xxx  or nr1/nr2b subunits. analysis of lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) release and trypan blue exclusion revealed an
increase in ab1–40 toxicity upon nr1/ xxxg964xxx  expression, compared to nr1/nr2b, indicating loss of plasma membrane integrity. furthermore,
ab1–40 decreased intracellular atp in cells expressing nr1/ xxxg964xxx . mk-801 ((+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5h-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10imine maleate), a noncompetitive nmda receptor antagonist, partially prevented the decrease in cell viability and the energy impairment. these
differences were not accounted for by the activation of caspases 2, 3, 8 and 9 or calpains or by dna fragmentation, excluding the hypothesis of
apoptosis. functional nr1/ xxxg964xxx  and nr1/nr2b receptor subtypes were further evidenced by single-cell calcium imaging. stimulation of nr1/
 xxxg964xxx  receptors with nmda/glycine revealed an increase in intracellular calcium in cells pre-exposed to ab1–40. opposite effects were observed
upon activation of nr1/nr2b receptors. these results suggest that nr1/ xxxg964xxx -composed nmda receptors mediate necrotic cell death in
hek293 cells exposed to ab1–40 through changes in calcium homeostasis.

1. introduction
alzheimer’s disease (ad) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting the elderly. ad is characterized by
the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.
senile plaques are composed of fibrils of b-amyloid peptide
(ab) derived from the proteolytic processing of amyloid
precursor protein (app) (hardy, 1997). app cleavage by b and
g-secretases produces ab1–40, which accounts for about 90% of
secreted ab peptide. the remaining fraction corresponds
mainly to ab1–42 (citron et al., 1996). notably, familial forms
of ad are caused by mutations in app and presenilins,
increasing ab production (selkoe, 2001). in addition, ab1–40,

ab1–42 and the ab25–35 fragment were shown to be neurotoxic
(yankner, 1996). according to the amyloid cascade hypothesis,
ab triggers the pathogenic amyloidogenic pathway, ultimately
leading to neuronal death and dementia (hardy and selkoe,
2002).
much information has been gathered on the mechanism by
which ab leads to neuronal loss. glutamate receptors and
particularly the n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptors play
an important role in ad pathophysiology (hynd et al., 2004b).
in early studies, ab was proposed to directly interact with
nmda receptors, since the toxic fragment ab25–35 showed
affinity for both glycine and glutamate agonist recognition sites
of the nmda receptor (cowburn et al., 1994, 1997).
furthermore, ab enhances glutamate toxicity and increases
intracellular calcium mediated by nmda receptors in neuronal
cultures and in vivo (harkany et al., 1999, 2000; mattson et al.,
1992). more recently, kelly and ferreira (2006) showed that
direct application of ab oligomers to hippocampal neurons
lead to sustained influx of calcium through nmda receptors.

a. domingues et al. / neurochemistry international 50 (2007) 872–880

these evidences suggest that ab can interfere with the nmda
receptor, leading to excitotoxicity, which results in an
overwhelming increase in intracellular calcium and in neuronal
death (arundine and tymianski, 2003). hence, one of the
current standard therapies for moderate to severe dementia
associated with ad includes treatment with the uncompetitive
nmda receptor antagonist memantine (lipton and chen,
2004). memantine has been shown to be effective at later stages
of human ad (reisberg et al., 2003), when fibril ab-induced
plaque formation is expected.
nmda receptors are highly permeable to calcium. this
subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors is composed of
hetero-oligomers of nr1,  xxxg964xxx – xxxg967xxx  and  xxxg968xxx -b subunits, generating receptors with different pharmacological and
physiological properties. nr1 is essential for the formation of
the nmda receptors and is ubiquitously expressed in the
central nervous system (michaelis, 1998). expression of
 xxxg964xxx /nr2b subunits increases during development.
although  xxxg964xxx  and nr2b are expressed in the cortex and
hippocampus of adult mammalian brain, nr2b expression is
higher at embryonic stages of development and decreases after
birth, whereas  xxxg964xxx  expression starts within one week after
birth (monyer et al., 1994).
nmda receptor subtypes composed by  xxxg964xxx  and nr2b
subunits appear to have an important role in neurodegenerative
disorders associated with excitotoxicity (kemp and mckernan,
2002; lynch and guttmann, 2002). activation of nr2bcomposed subtypes is important for the selective neuronal
degeneration observed in huntington’s disease (zeron et al.,
2002), whereas  xxxg964xxx  knockout mice are less prone to cerebral
injury after focal brain ischemia (morikawa et al., 1998).
interestingly, expression of  xxxg964xxx  and nr2b subunits is
diminished in post-mortem ad brains (hynd et al., 2004a;
mishizen-eberz et al., 2004; sze et al., 2001), suggesting that
neurons expressing these receptor subunits are more likely to
degenerate in ad.
considering the insufficient information regarding the role
of nmda receptor subtypes on cell vulnerability induced by
ab, in this study, we determined the contribution of nr1/
 xxxg964xxx  and nr1/nr2b receptor subtypes on ab toxicity. using
transiently transfected hek293 cells exposed to ab1–40 we
show that nr1/ xxxg964xxx  expressing cells are more liable to ab
toxicity, when compared to cells expressing nr1/nr2b.
increased cell susceptibility is associated with increased
calcium levels upon exposure to ab1–40 and stimulation of
nmda receptors.
2. experimental procedures
2.1. materials
the transfection reagent superfect was obtained from qiagen (hilden,
germany). protease inhibitors (chymostatin, pepstatin a, leupeptin and
antipain), penicillin/streptomycin, dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
(dmem), kynurenate and n-acetyl-ile-glu-pro-asp-p-nitroanilide (aciepd-pna) were from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo, usa). mk801 ((+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5h-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine
maleate), n-acetyl-asp-glu-val-asp-p-nitroanilide (ac-devd-pna) was

873

obtained from calbiochem (darmstadt, germany). n-acetyl-val-asp-valala-asp-p-nitroanilide (ac-vdvad-pna) and n-acetyl-leu-glu-his-aspp-nitroanilide (ac-lehd-pna) were from biosource international, inc.
(nivelles, belgium). primary antibodies against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ) and  xxxg964xxx  were obtained from chemicon (temecula, ca, usa) and the primary antibody against nr2b was obtained from
bd biosciences (san jose, ca, usa). fura-2/am and hoechst 33342 were
from molecular probes (eugene, or, usa). fetal bovine serum was from
biochrom ag (berlin, germany). polyvinylidene difluoride (pvdf) membranes and enhanced chemifluorescence reagent were from amersham
biosciences (buckinghamshire, uk). the lichrospher 100 rp-l8 (5 mm)
column was from merck (darmstadt, germany). the synthetic ab1–40
peptide was from bachem (bubendorf, switzerland). all other reagents
were of analytical grade.

2.2. cell culture and transfection
hek293 cells were grown in dmem supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, penicillin (100 u/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). cells
were grown to 50–70% confluence on poly-l-lysine (0.1 mg/ml) coated
multiwells or glass coverslips and transfected using superfect reagent
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. for co-transfections the plasmid ratio was 1:3 or 1:4 for nr1: xxxg964xxx  or nr1:nr2b, respectively. cells
were transfected with the dna-superfect mixture for 4 h, media was
replaced and cells were incubated for 24–48 h with 1 mm ab1–40, 10 mm
mk-801 and/or 1 mm kynurenate (the latter two nmda receptor antagonists), where indicated. prior to use, ab1–40 peptide was diluted in pbs and
left to age for 7 days at 37 8c. previous studies in our institute by resende
and co-workers (unpublished data) showed that b-sheet fibrils are the
predominant species in ab1–40 solution originated from the same batch
and prepared using the same protocol. the rat nr1 (nr1a),  xxxg964xxx , and
nr2b cdna clones inserted in pgfp-n3, pcdnai or pdp3, respectively,
were a generous gift from dr. john woodward (medical university of south
carolina, charleston, usa). nr1 is expressed as a fusion protein with
egfp, referred throughout the manuscript as nr1-gfp.

2.3. analysis of transfection efficiency by immunocytochemistry
twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were fixed with methanol/
acetone (1:1) and permeabilized with 0.2% triton x-100. after blocking with
3% bsa, cells were incubated with the antibodies directed against  xxxg964xxx 
(1:100) or nr2b (1:100) overnight at 4 8c, followed by incubation with antiigg mouse (1:200) or rabbit (1:200) secondary antibodies conjugated with
alexa fluor 594, for 1 h at room temperature. cells were then incubated with
5 mg/ml hoechst 33342 for 10 min to stain cell nuclei. the coverslips were
fixed to glass slide with mounting medium and visualized by fluorescence
microscopy (zeiss axiovert 200). nr1 transfected cells were identified by gfp
fluorescence. nuclei staining with hoechst 33342 helped to determine the total
number of cells in each field.

2.4. cell viability assays
(i) lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) measurements: the integrity of the plasma
membrane was determined by monitoring the activity of the
cytoplasmic enzyme ldh in the extracellular medium, which
represents a common procedure to determine loss of membrane
integrity (e.g. almeida et al., 2004). assessment of intracellular ldh
was determined after lysing the cells with 10 mm hepes (ph 7.4) plus
0.01% triton x-100, freezing (80 8c) and thawing. cell debris in
both aliquots (intra and extracellular) were removed by centrifugation
at 20,800  g, for 10 min. ldh activity was determined spectrophotometrically (perkin-elmer lambda-2), by following the rate of
conversion of  xxxd532xxx  (nadh) to
oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad+) at 340 nm. ldh
released into the extracellular medium was expressed as a percentage
of total ldh activity in cells (percent of ldh released = extracellular
ldh/(extracellular + intracellular ldh)).

(ii) trypan blue counting: upon treatment, cells in suspension in the
medium were pelleted by centrifugation at 550  g for 5 min. cells
were resuspended in dmem containing 0.1% trypan blue. the total
number of cells, positive or negative for trypan blue, was counted
using a neubauer chamber.

2.5. determination of  xxxd83xxx  (atp)
intracellular atp levels were determined after cell extraction with 0.3 m
perchloric acid (0–4 8c). the cells were centrifuged at 15,800  g for 5 min
and the pellet was solubilized with 1 m naoh for total protein analysis using
the biorad protein assay. the supernatants were neutralized with 5 m koh in
2.5 m tris and centrifuged at 15,800  g for 10 min. the resulting supernatants, stored at 80 8c, were assayed for atp determination, by separation in
a reverse-phase hplc, as described previously (rego et al., 1997), using a
mobile phase of 100 mm kh2po4, at ph 7.4, and 1% methanol, at a flow rate of
1.2 ml/min, for 6 min. a beckman system gold hplc apparatus was used for
atp measurements, consisting of a 126 binary pump model and a 166 variable
uv detector, controlled by a computer. a lichrospher 100 rp-l8 (5 mm)
column was used and absorbance was monitored at 254 nm. peak identity was
determined by following the retention time of known standards. the amount of
atp was determined by a concentration standard curve.

2.6. caspase protease activity assay
caspase-like activities were determined according to the method described
by almeida et al. (2004). after the incubation period, the culture media was
removed and cells were washed in ice-cold pbs. lysis buffer containing (in
mm): 25 hepes, 2 mgcl26h2o, 1 edta, 1 egta, at ph 7.4, supplemented
with 1 mm 1,4-dithiotreitol (dtt), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
(pmsf) and 1:1000 protease inhibitor cocktail (chymotatin, pepstatin a,
leupeptin and antipain, 1 mg/ml) was added to cells, on ice. cell lysates were
frozen three times in liquid n2 and centrifuged at 20,800  g, for 10 min. the
resulting supernatants were assayed for protein content using the biorad protein
assay. to measure caspase activity, 25–65 mg protein were added to a reaction
buffer (25 mm hepes, 10% sucrose, 0.1% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate (chaps), ph 7.5) containing the colorimetric
substrates (100 mm) for: caspases 2 (ac-vdvad-pna), 3 (ac-devd-pna), 8
(ac-ietd-pna) and 9 (ac-lehd-pna)–like activities. the reaction mixtures
were incubated at 37 8c for 2 h, and the formation of pna was measured at
405 nm using a 96-well plate reader (slt.spectra). caspases-like activities
were calculated as the increase above the control, for equal protein loads.

2.7. western blotting
for analysis of nmda receptor expression, the culture medium was
removed and cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer, containing (in mm): 20 tris
(ph 7), 100 nacl, 2 edta, 2 egta, 0.1 pmsf, 1:1000 protease inhibitor
cocktail plus 1% triton x-100. cell extracts were further sonicated for 30 s and
centrifuged at 20,800  g for 10 min, 4 8c. the supernatant was collected and
protein content was determined using the biorad protein assay. to detect aspectrin cleavage, cellular extracts were prepared as described for the caspase
protease activity assay. equivalent amounts of protein were separated on a 6.5%
sds-page gel and electroblotted onto pvdf membranes. after blocking with
5% skim milk in tbs (25 mm tris/hcl, ph 7.6, 150 mm nacl)/0.1% tween,
for 2 h at rt, the membranes were incubated with the antibodies directed
against the nmda receptor subunits  xxxg964xxx  (1:100) and nr2b (1:100) or aspectrin (1:2500), overnight at 4 8c. the membranes were further incubated
with the respective secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase
(1:20,000) and the proteins were visualized by using enhanced chemifluorescence reagent. the antibody directed against  xxxg861xxx  (1:2500) was used to
normalize the amount of protein per lane.

2.8. calcium imaging
prior to imaging, transfected cells grown in glass coverslips were washed
twice and incubated with 5 mm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2/am), a

high affinity ratiometric intracellular calcium indicator (kd = 0.14 mm), in
the presence of 0.025% pluronic acid, for 45 min at 37 8c, in a modified
ringer’s solution (135 mm nacl, 5.4 mm kcl, 1.8 mm cacl2, 10 mm
glucose, 5 mm hepes, ph 7.2) supplemented with 1% bsa (modified
from blevins et al., 1995). coverslips were then mounted onto an imaging
chamber (model ph-3, warner instrument corporation, hamden, usa) and
placed on the stage of a zeiss axiovert 200 inverted microscope. the
chamber was perfused continuously during all the experiments with modified ringer’s solution at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. solutions were applied
using a valvebank8ii (automate scientific, san francisco, ca, usa)
controlled manually. cells were exposed to alternating 340 and 380 nm
light from a xenon lamp via a shutter lambda dg-4 and images were
acquired via a coolsnap hq photometrics video camera (roper scientific,
duluth, ga, usa). images were acquired every 10 s before and after
stimulation, and every second during 120 s starting with nmda
(100 mm) plus glycine (10 mm) stimulation. cells were stimulated 3 times
with nmda/glycine, for 30 s. ratio images were generated using the
metafluor 5.02 (universal imaging corporation, downingtown, pa,
usa). ratios 340/380 were normalized to basal values. the peak of nmda/
glycine-evoked increase in intracellular calcium (fig. 4c–f) was calculated
by subtracting the value determined just before each stimulation. only
gfp identified nr1-expressing cells were taken into account for calcium
analysis.

2.9. statistical analysis
data are expressed as mean  s.e.m. of the number of experiments
indicated in figure legends. comparisons between two groups were performed
with the student’s t test (graphpad prism version 4.0). significance was
accepted at p < 0.05.

3. results
3.1. nmda receptor subunit expression in hek293 cells
hek293 cells lack native nmda receptors. thus, defined
nmda receptor subunits can be expressed, allowing
examining the contribution of each receptor subtype. indeed,
the biophysical properties of native nmda receptors and
recombinant nmda receptors expressed in hek293 cells
have been reported to be very similar (lynch and guttmann,
2001). in this study, we used hek293 cells to assess whether
nmda receptor subtypes, nr1/ xxxg964xxx  or nr1/nr2b,
differently mediate the toxic effects of ab1–40.
 xxxg964xxx  and nr2b protein expression was detected by
western-blotting (fig. 1a and b). these data were confirmed
by immunocytofluorescence, by determining the number of
cells expressing nr1 (detected due to the gfp fluorescence)
and  xxxg964xxx  or nr2b subunits. the percentage of cells
expressing both nr1 and  xxxg964xxx  was 18.5  3.04%, which
was very similar to the number of cells in which coexpression of nr1 and nr2b was detected (17.7  2.71%,
fig. 1c). since a prolonged incubation with ab was applied,
we evaluated whether ab1–40 affected the transfection
efficiency of nmda receptor subunits. according to data
depicted in fig. 1d, the transfection efficiency of nr1-gfp
was not altered upon exposure to 1 mm ab1–40, for 24 h.
similar results were observed after 48 h exposure to ab1–40
(not shown). co-transfection efficiency was slightly reduced
compared to nr1-gfp transfection efficiency alone (fig. 1c
and d).

or 1:4, and expression allowed for 24 h. (a and b) western blot analysis of cell homogenates—the amounts of protein loaded are indicated in the figure. untransfected
hek293 cell extracts were used as negative control (hek). (c) the percentage of hek293 cells expressing both nr1 and  xxxg964xxx  or nr2b subunits were examined
by immunocytofluorescence 48 h after transfection using specific antibodies against  xxxg964xxx  or nr2b. (d) cells transfected with nr1-gfp alone were incubated in the
absence or in the presence of ab1–40 (1 mm) for 24 h. the percentage of cells was determined by counting the total number of cells stained with hoechst 33342. the
average number of cell per field was approximately 200 and 4 fields per condition were counted. data are expressed as the mean  s.e.m. of two distinct experiments
performed in duplicates.

3.2. ab toxicity in cells expressing nr1/ xxxg964xxx  or nr1/
nr2b subunits
toxic effects of ab can be mediated by activation of nmda
receptors (e.g. harkany et al., 1999, 2000; mattson et al., 1992).
to ascertain the role of specific nmda receptors subtypes on
ab toxicity, we evaluated the viability of cells expressing nr1gfp alone, nr1/ xxxg964xxx  and nr1/nr2b upon exposure to ab1–
40. expression of nr1-gfp alone or exposure to ab1–40
induced a small percentage of ldh release (fig. 2a).
expression of nr1/ xxxg964xxx  and nr1/nr2b in the absence of
ab largely increased the release of ldh by about 32 and 23%,
respectively. incubation with 10 mm mk-801 under these
conditions reduced the release of ldh in cells expressing nr1/
 xxxg964xxx  and nr1/nr2b, respectively, to 15 and 14% (not
shown). this activation of nmda receptor subtypes is
expected to be accounted for by the presence of glutamate
in the culture medium (approximately 178 mm in media with
serum, as described by anegawa et al. (1995)). in agreement
with our data, expression of nr1/ xxxg964xxx  subunits in nonneuronal mammalian cell lines was previously reported to be
more toxic than expression of nr1/nr2b (anegawa et al.,
1995, 2000; boeckman and aizenman, 1996).
incubation of nr1/nr2b expressing cells with 1 mm ab1–
did
not further increase ldh release (fig. 2a). however,
40
exposure of nr1/ xxxg964xxx  expressing cells to ab1–40 significantly increased ldh release to 41.1  5.8%. furthermore,
ldh release was highly reduced by mk-801 (10 mm)
(fig. 2a), a nmda receptor open-channel blocker which
does not show differential selectivity for any nmda receptor
subtype (monaghan and larsen, 1997), suggesting that cell
death is dependent on nmda receptor activation.
because hek293 grow as adherent cells, we followed the
cell detachment from poly-l-lysine-covered wells as an

indication of loss of cell viability. concordantly with ldh
release (fig. 2a), the number of cells in suspension (fig. 2b)
largely increased upon exposure to ab1–40 (1 mm) in cells
expressing nr1/ xxxg964xxx  only. moreover, mk-801 prevented cell
detachment.
3.3. effect of ab on intracellular atp upon expression of
nr1/ xxxg964xxx  or nr1/nr2b subunits
excitotoxicity is characterized by the loss of mitochondrial
function and disruption of atp production (rego and oliveira,
2003). ab was previously shown to reduce atp levels in
synaptosomes and to induce loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential in primary hippocampal neurons (pereira et al., 2000;
santos et al., 2005). given that impairment of energy
production is a common feature of both glutamate and ab
toxicity, we determined the changes in intracellular atp levels.
in nr1 and nr1/nr2b expressing cells, the intracellular atp
content was not significantly altered upon exposure to ab1–40
(fig. 2c). in contrast, nr1/ xxxg964xxx  expressing cells showed
reduced levels of intracellular atp in the presence of ab1–40
(p < 0.05 as compared to nr1/ xxxg964xxx  cells in the absence of
ab1–40). moreover, blockade of nmda receptor ionic channel
with mk-801 prevented ab-induced decrease in endogenous
atp levels (fig. 2c) in nr1/ xxxg964xxx  expressing cells. compared
to atp, endogenous levels of adp and amp in hek293 were
very low and thus not detected using our chromatographic
detection conditions.
3.4. protease activity in ab-treated cells expressing nr1/
 xxxg964xxx  or nr1/nr2b subunits
both ldh leakage (fig. 2a) and decreased endogenous
atp levels (fig. 2c) induced by ab1–40 suggested the

876

a. domingues et al. / neurochemistry international 50 (2007) 872–880

caspases (e.g. budd et al., 2000; harada and sugimoto, 1999;
mattson et al., 1998). in order to establish whether apoptosis
was part of the cell death process in our conditions, we
measured the activation of  xxxg342xxx , linked to the death
receptor pathway, caspase 9, involved in the mitochondrial
pathway,  xxxg341xxx , an effector caspase, and caspase 2, which
seems to be involved in the initiation of the mitochondrial
pathway (cohen, 1997; lassus et al., 2002). no significant
changes in caspases activation were observed in cells
expressing nr1/ xxxg964xxx  or nr1/nr2b subunits and further
exposed to ab1–40 (fig. 3a–d). consistently, no evidence of
dna fragmentation or condensation was detected when using
the dna marker hoechst 33342 (data not shown).
some studies have linked increased activity of calpains to
neuronal cell death occurring in ad brains (adamec et al.,
2002; nixon et al., 1994; shimohama et al., 1991). calpains are
activated by abnormal calcium levels, and thus are important
during excitotoxicity mediated by nmda receptors (brorson
et al., 1995; wang, 2000). hence, we evaluated whether abinduced cell death in nr1/ xxxg964xxx  transfected cells involved
calpain activation. for that purpose, we analysed the breakdown pattern of a-spectrin, a sensitive substrate of both
calpains and  xxxg341xxx  (wang, 2000). although full-length aspectrin was easily detectable in hek293 cells, no fragments
(150 and 145 kda bands) resulting from calpain activity were
observed under non-stimulated conditions (fig. 3e). in
addition,  xxxg341xxx  cleavage (150 and 120 kda bands) was
not detected either (fig. 3e), consistent with the colorimetric
enzymatic assay (fig. 3b).

cells. necrotic and apoptotic cell death mechanisms may not
occur independently (nicotera and melino, 2004). indeed,
excitotoxic stimuli and exposure to ab1–40 may induce cell
death with apoptotic features, namely through the activation of

calcium influx through the nmda receptor is essential for
both the physiological and pathological roles of this receptor.
therefore, we next tested whether exposure to ab1–40 altered
the influx of calcium occurring through nr1/ xxxg964xxx  or nr1/
nr2b receptor subtypes. transfected hek293 cells were preincubated with 1 mm ab1–40 and calcium influx was monitored
following stimulation with nmda (100 mm) and glycine
(10 mm) in cells showing gfp fluorescence. analysis of
intracellular calcium upon nmda/glycine stimulation revealed
an increase in calcium influx in nr1/ xxxg964xxx  expressing cells
pre-treated with ab1–40, compared to non-treated cells (fig. 4a
and c). furthermore, incubation with ab1–40 in the presence of
kynurenate, a reversible competitive nmda receptor antagonist, prevented the increase in calcium rise upon activation of
nr1/ xxxg964xxx  receptors (fig. 4e).
interestingly, in cells expressing nr1/nr2b subtype and
exposed to ab1–40 a significant decrease in intracellular
calcium rise was observed after the first stimulation with
nmda/glycine, compared to non-treated cells (fig. 4b and d).
similarly to fig. 4e, no differences were found in nr1/nr2b
expressing cells pre-treated with kynurenate (fig. 4f), implicating that for both receptor subunits ( xxxg964xxx  and nr2b) the
effect of treatment with ab1–40 is precluded in the absence of
nmda receptor activity.

4. discussion
ab is a major component of senile plaques found in ad. ab
is responsible for causing toxicity through several mechanisms,
namely excitotoxicity mediated by the nmda receptors. in this
study we provide evidence that ab1–40 exerts its toxic effects
through nr1/ xxxg964xxx -composed nmda receptors in hek293
cells. cell death was characterized by the loss of membrane
integrity, energy deficits and the lack of apoptotic features,
highly suggesting necrotic cell death. increased toxicity of
ab1–40 upon expression of nr1/ xxxg964xxx  was correlated with
increased nr1/ xxxg964xxx  calcium permeability upon selective
receptor stimulation. moreover, nmda receptor antagonists,
mk-801 and kynurenate, prevented cell death and the rise in

calcium, implicating that opening of the nmda receptorassociated ion channel and subsequent ion influx are required
for ab-induced degeneration of hek293 cells.
necrotic cell death was previously reported upon exposure
to ab (behl et al., 1994). evidence for necrotic cell death in ad
brains was also described (velez-pardo et al., 2001). in
addition, in a genetic model of ad carrying a  xxxg1857xxx 
mutation, hippocampal neurons became hypersensitive to
excitotoxic necrosis (guo et al., 1999). the mechanism of
cell death in these conditions included deranged calcium
homeostasis and mitochondrial deficits (guo et al., 1999), as
predicted by the excitotoxic paradigm. in recent reports, kelly
and ferreira (2006) also showed that application of soluble ab
to hippocampal neurons induced a fast and sustained

intracellular calcium increase, which was significantly attenuated in the presence of nmda receptor antagonists. in the
present study, cell death due to exposure to ab was
accompanied by diminished intracellular atp and altered
calcium responses to nmda, which was mediated by specific
nmda receptor subunits. indeed, expression of functional
nr1/ xxxg964xxx  receptor subunits in hek293 cells facilitated ab1–
40 toxicity.
despite the evidence that ab increases nmda receptor
activity by acting as an agonist or co-agonist of nmda
receptors (cowburn et al., 1994, 1997), we find it less likely to
explain the increased calcium response of nr1/ xxxg964xxx  cells
because the cells were thoroughly washed before single-cell
calcium measurements. there is, however, the possibility that
some ab peptide remained bound to the receptors. indeed,
although significant differences in calcium rise were observed
following the first and second stimulus with nmda/glycine,
the effect of ab treatment decreased after the third stimulation,
which could be accounted for by a decrease in the interaction of
ab with the receptor subunits during perfusion, despite the

wash out of excess peptide prior to the experiments. we may
also consider that ab indirectly increased nr1/ xxxg964xxx  subtype
activity by changing its phosphorylation status. cyclindependent kinase-5 (cdk-5) has an important role in ad
pathology, since it is responsible for tau hyperphosphorylation,
resulting in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, and its
activity is increased by ab (alvarez et al., 1999). in addition,
cdk-5 phosphorylates  xxxg964xxx  at ser1232, enhancing nmda
receptor function (li et al., 2001). interestingly, disruption of
the interaction between  xxxg964xxx  and cdk-5 was shown to be
neuroprotective in an animal model of forebrain ischemia
(wang et al., 2003), revealing the importance of  xxxg964xxx 
phosphorylation in pathological processes.
calpains are important during excitotoxicity mediated by
nmda receptors (e.g. brorson et al., 1995). these enzymes
can also be part of the cell death mechanisms occurring in ad
(adamec et al., 2002; nixon et al., 1994; shimohama et al.,
1991). recently, activation of nmda receptors composed of
nr2b subunits was shown to mediate neuronal death through
calpain activation (zhou and baudry, 2006). in the context of

a. domingues et al. / neurochemistry international 50 (2007) 872–880

ab toxic mechanisms, calpains activation seems to be
dependent on calcium influx occurring through nmda
receptors (kelly and ferreira, 2006), but the contribution of
each receptor subunit is yet to be determined. calpain
activation and its link to nmda receptor subunits can be
quite complex because calpains modulate nmda receptor
activity by cleaving  xxxg964xxx  and nr2b subunits and developmental and regional differences exist in this cross-talk (dong
et al., 2006). although other authors have reported that
activation of nmda receptors leads to proteolytic activity of
calpain in transfected hek293 cells (guttmann et al., 2002;
simpkins et al., 2003), we were unable to detect calpain
activation under our experimental conditions. this observation
could be account for by low basal calcium concentrations under
non-stimulated conditions and/or by the different protocols
used to detect calpain activation. moreover, hek293 cells and
neurons may have distinct calpain regulatory mechanisms and
so differences inherent to the cellular models might explain
some differences between our data and other published studies.
exposure to ab1–42 was previously shown to promote
endocytosis of nmda receptor subunits, namely nr1 and
nr2b, in cortical neurons (snyder et al., 2005). these authors
showed that neurons from a genetic mouse model of ad
expressed reduced amounts of surface nmda receptors
(snyder et al., 2005). unfortunately, the effect of ab1–42 on
 xxxg964xxx  surface expression was not examined. furthermore,
hippocampal neurons pre-exposed to ab were protected against
glutamate toxicity (goto et al., 2006). the protective effect in
these conditions was ascribed to nr1 endocytosis (goto et al.,
2006). in view of these data, we may hypothesize that
endocytosis of nr1/nr2b subunits increases the number of
nmda receptors composed of nr1/ xxxg964xxx  at the cell surface,
thus increasing neuronal susceptibility to ab toxicity.
in conclusion, our data highly suggest that ab1–40 has
contrasting toxic effects on nr1/ xxxg964xxx  and nr1/nr2bcomposed nmda receptor subtypes in hek293 cells. indeed,
 xxxg964xxx -composed nmda receptors are likely to play a role in
ab1–40 toxicity and thus in ad. nevertheless, further studies in
cellular and/or animal ad models will be required to gain
additional insights on the mechanisms underlying the
selectivity of nr2 subunits in ab toxicity and ad. it is our
view that increasing the evidence of involvement of specific
nmda receptor subunits in neurodegeneration, namely in ad,
will warrant further investigation of new and more efficient
antagonists that may be used for therapeutic purposes.
