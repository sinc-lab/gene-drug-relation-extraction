and bolesław rutkowski, md,  xxxg684xxx 
background: agents inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (raas) system have an important
role in slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease. we evaluated the hypothesis that the addition
of an  xxxg1602xxx  antagonist to an  xxxg36xxx  (ace) inhibitor and
 xxxg99xxx  type 1 (at-1) receptor blocker (arb) (triple raas blockade) may provide an additional
benefit compared with an ace inhibitor and arb (double raas blockade).
design: randomized open controlled crossover study.
setting & participants: 18 whites (7 women, 11 men) from the outpatient department of nephrology
with chronic nondiabetic proteinuric kidney diseases, mean age 42.4 ⫾ 1.9 years (sem).
interventions: in the 8-week run-in period, all participants received the ace inhibitor  xxxd1694xxx  (5
mg), the arb  xxxd3303xxx  (80 mg), and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) as double raas
blockade to achieve the target blood pressure of less than 130/80 mm hg. participants were then
randomly assigned to 2 treatment sequences, either the addition of spironolactone (25 mg) (triple raas
blockade) through 8 weeks followed by double raas blockade through 8 weeks (sequence 1) or double
raas blockade followed by triple raas blockade (sequence 2).
main outcome measures: 24-hour urine protein excretion (primary end point) and markers of tubular
injury and fibrosis (secondary end points). analysis was performed using analysis of variance for
repeated measurements.
results: at baseline, mean serum creatinine level was 1.16 ⫾ 0.09 mg/dl (103 ⫾ 8 ␮mol/l), estimated
glomerular filtration rate was 107.8 ml/min (95% confidence interval, 93 to 140.9 [1.8 ml/s; 95% confidence
interval, 1.55 to 2.35; cockcroft-gault formula), and 24-hour mean proteinuria was 0.97 ⫾ 0.18 g. mean
urine protein excretion was 0.7 g/24 h (95% confidence interval, 0.48 to 0.92) less after triple raas blockade
than after double raas blockade (p ⫽ 0.01), without change in blood pressure. urine excretion of
n-acetyl-␤-d-glucosaminidase (p ⫽ 0.02) and amino-terminal propeptide of type iii procollagen (p ⫽ 0.05)
also significantly decreased. potassium levels increased significantly after triple therapy (p ⫽ 0.02).
however, no patient was withdrawn because of adverse effects.
limitations: absence of blinding, small sample size, short treatment period, absence of histological
assessment.
conclusions: administration of an  xxxg1602xxx  antagonist in addition to double raas
blockade with an ace inhibitor and arb may slow the progression of chronic kidney disease. additional
studies are necessary to confirm this result.

triple raas blockade as a nephroprotection

such patients and also in subjects after renal
transplantation.5,6 however, neither ace inhibitors nor arbs, even in high doses or concomitant use, abrogate the progression of ckd completely. innovative approaches are needed to keep
patients with ckd off dialysis therapy. additional blockade of the aldosterone pathway may
prove to be such a beneficial therapeutic concept.
aldosterone, a final effector of the raas, has
a significant role in the pathogenesis of ckd
independently of  xxxg99xxx  through direct
cellular action. this includes promoting inflammatory response, endothelial dysfunction, and
fibrosis by increasing  xxxg2058xxx  and transforming growth factor ␤1
expression and reactive oxygen species stimulation.7 other mechanisms include the ability of
aldosterone to potentiate the deleterious effects
of  xxxg99xxx  as a result of upregulation of
 xxxg99xxx  receptor type at-1.8 a number of
observations suggested that the nongenomic vasoconstrictor action of aldosterone led to increased arterial and glomerular capillary pressure.9
both ace inhibitors and arbs, even at currently approved doses, fail to suppress aldosterone synthesis effectively. this may occur, at
least in part, because aldosterone synthesis is
strongly regulated out of the renin-angiotensin
axis via potassium levels, and  xxxg1801xxx .7 moreover, the initial suppression of aldosterone is not sustained long term. in
40% to 50% of patients, an aldosterone escape
phenomenon was observed; that is, circulating
aldosterone levels increased after some months
of treatment with an ace inhibitor or arb.10
given these facts, additional administration of an
 xxxg1602xxx  antagonist to combination
treatment with an ace inhibitor and arb, socalled triple raas blockade, may provide additional renal protection. to shed more light on this
issue, we performed a randomized open controlled study to evaluate the influence of triple
raas therapy on surrogate markers of kidney
injury, ie, proteinuria, markers of tubular involvement, and kidney fibrosis.

our renal outpatient department. inclusion criteria were age
of 18 to 65 years, nondiabetic proteinuric ckd, normal or
slightly impaired stable renal function expressed as serum
creatinine level less than 1.7 mg/dl (⬍150 ␮mol/l; estimated glomerular filtration rate [egfr] ⬎ 45 ml/min [⬎0.75
ml/s]), stable proteinuria greater than 0.3 g/24 h at the
randomization point, hypertension, and no steroids or other
immunosuppressive treatment a minimum of 6 months before the study. patients with nephrotic syndrome were excluded. the study was approved by the local ethical committee, and patients gave their written consent for participation
in this study.

general protocol
the study was a randomized open 2 ⫻ 2 crossover trial in
which renal effects of double and triple raas blockade
were compared. at the beginning, participants who met the
inclusion criteria entered the 8-week run-in period, during
which any previously used ace inhibitors or arbs were
stopped.  xxxd1694xxx  ( xxxd1694xxx ; hoffman la-roche, basel,
switzerland) was continued or newly administered to patients who had not received this agent previously. a maximal
recommended dose of 5 mg once daily in the morning was
set. patients also were administered hydrochlorothiazide in a
dose of 12.5 mg once daily and  xxxd3303xxx , 80 mg, once
daily in the morning ( xxxd3303xxx ; boehringer ingelheim, ingelheim, germany). there was no washout period between
antihypertensive agents used previously and the study treatment involving  xxxd1694xxx  and  xxxd3303xxx . to achieve the
target office trough blood pressure (bp) of 130/80 mm hg or
less, adjuvant antihypertensive treatment with doxazosin
was used, if necessary. when the target bp was achieved,
patients received such adjusted therapy (background therapy)
until the end of the run-in period, but not less than 6 weeks.
patients were recommended not to change their usual daily
protein and sodium intake during the study periods. at the
end of the run-in period, they were randomly assigned to 1 of
2 treatment sequences: 8-week background therapy with the
addition of 25 mg of spironolactone/8-week background
therapy without spironolactone (sequence 1) or 8-week
background therapy without spironolactone/8-week background therapy with the addition of 25 mg of spironolactone
(sequence 2; fig 1). there was no washout between the 2
treatments in each sequence. afterward, the same 8-week
background therapy as in the run-in period was administered
as a control period for stability of background proteinuria.

spironolactone, the  xxxg1602xxx  antagonist (spironol; polfa grodzisk, grodzisk mazowiecki, poland), was
administered once daily in the morning. allocation was
performed independent of the research team person according to a computer-generated randomization list. dosages of
 xxxd1694xxx ,  xxxd3303xxx , and hydrochlorothiazide, once established in the run-in period, were unchanged throughout the
study. target bp was an office trough bp of 130/80 mm hg
or less. drug adherence was assessed by means of tablet
counts. at the end of each of the 2 treatment periods, values
for office trough bp, 24-hour ambulatory bp, serum creatinine, potassium, hemoglobin, and plasma renin activity
(pra) and 24-hour urine excretion of protein (upe),
n-acetyl-␤-d-glucosaminidase (nag), ␣1-microglobulin
(␣1m), amino-terminal propeptide of type iii procollagen
(piiinp), creatinine, sodium, and urea were determined.

procedures and laboratory methods
office trough bp was measured using a mercury sphygmomanometer with the patient in a sitting position after 10
minutes of rest and expressed as a mean value of 2 consecutive measurements obtained 2 minutes apart. ambulatory bp
was measured continuously for 24 hours using the mobil-ograph (version 12) monitoring system (i.e.m. gmbh, stolberg, germany). bp was measured every 15 minutes during
the day (7:00 am to 10:00 pm) and every 30 minutes during
the night (10:00 pm to 7:00 am). all patients were equipped
with a scaled container and were strictly informed how to
collect urine. on 2 different days, they collected two 24-hour
urine samples. from those, mean values of upe, sodium
excretion, and urea excretion were calculated for data evaluation. patients were asked not to perform heavy physical
activity on urine collection days. urea excretion was used to
calculate protein intake according to the equation of maroni
et al11: protein intake normalized to weight (g/kg/d) ⫽ 6.25
⫻ ([urea nitrogen excretion in urine (g/d)] ⫹ [0.0031 ⫻
body weight (kg)])/body weight (kg). egfr was calculated
according to the cockroft-gault equation.12
blood samples for pra were obtained after overnight
fasting and 30 minutes at rest lying down before study drug
administration. samples were stored at ⫺75°c until assayed. pra was measured by means of radioimmunoassay
(renctk; diasorin, stillwater, mn) that estimates the
amount of  xxxg99xxx  generated by the action of renin on
 xxxg99xxx . hemoglobin, urea, potassium, sodium, protein, and creatinine were measured by using standard laboratory techniques. adverse effects were recorded at each visit
in response to questionnaires or as observed by the investigators.
the first morning urine sample was collected for determination of piiinp. samples were stored at ⫺75°c until
assayed. urinary piiinp was measured by using a radioimmunoassay kit obtained from orion diagnostica (espoo,
finland). intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation
were 3.0% and 6.5% for 2.8 and 2.7 ␮g/l, respectively. the
measuring range of the assay is 1.0 to 50 ␮g/l, and the
detection limit is 0.3 ␮g/l.
nag and ␣1m were analyzed in the second morning
spot-urine sample. nag was determined by using the spectrophotometric method according to maruhn13 and was
described in detail elsewhere.6 immunoturbidimetric test

tylicki et al
(tina-quant ␣1-microglobulin; roche, basel, switzerland)
was used for quantitative determination of ␣1m in urine. the
detection limit of the method was 2 mg/l. urinary nag,
␣1m, and piiinp were reported per milligram or gram of
urine creatinine to correct the variation in urine concentration.

statistics
data from previous studies were used for sample size
calculation.14,15 the primary end point of this study was a
difference in 24-hour upe in measurements available for
each patient after treatment with double and triple raas
blockade. baseline 24-hour proteinuria of patients from this
population of 0.75 ⫾ 0.5 g/24 h was predicted. assuming a
30% decrease in proteinuria after adding spironolactone to
double raas blockade, we predicted a decrease in proteinuria from 0.75 to 0.50 g/24 h with triple raas therapy. to
give the study 80% power to detect such a difference as
statistically significant (p ⬍ 0.05, 2 tailed) with an expected
sd of 0.25 g/24 h, 18 patients had to complete the study.
secondary end points included urine nag, ␣1m, and piiinp excretion. normality and homogeneity of variances
were verified by means of shapiro-wilk test and levene test,
respectively. because of their skewed distribution, diastolic
bp, egfr, pra, and piiinp urine excretion were logarithmically transformed before statistical analysis and expressed
as geometric means and 95% confidence intervals. other
results are expressed as mean ⫾ sem. differences in variables measured more than twice were assessed by using
analysis of variance (anova) for repeated measurements
with bonferroni correction for paired comparisons, otherwise paired t-test. p less than 0.05 (2 tailed) is considered
statistically significant. data were evaluated using the statistica (version 7.1; statsoft inc, tulsa, ok) software package.
to prevent or limit the possibility of a period effect, we
introduced a degree of balance into the study design with a
scheme of randomization allowing every treatment to be
represented in every period with the same frequency (fig 1).
to check for the presence of period effect, values for
variables at the randomization point and end of the study
were compared. to prevent or limit the risk of carryover
effect, we planned each treatment period for 8 weeks.
previous studies showed that effects of  xxxg1602xxx 
blockade on proteinuria were fully reversible within 4
weeks.14 thus, prolonging each treatment period for 8
weeks allowed us to rule out a residual effect of previous
treatment at the end of week 8, when proteinuria was
measured. the grizzle approach was used to investigate the
possibility of a carryover effect from the first to the second
treatment periods of the study.16 an analysis restricted to the
first treatment period was planned if a carryover effect could
not be excluded by using this approach. the test by grubbs17
was used for detecting outliers.

results
of 18 patients who entered the study, 18
(100%) completed the protocol (fig 2). baseline
clinical data at the randomization point are listed
in table 1. to achieve the target bp, doxazosin (4

mg once daily) had to be supplemented in 1 of 18
patients in all treatment periods. grizzle analysis
excluded the possibility of a carryover effect
between 2 treatment periods for upe, pra,
urine nag, ␣1m, and piiinp excretion. to check
for the presence of period effect, differences
between main variables at the randomization
point and the end of the study were compared
and found not to be significant.
control of bp was adequate in all study periods; 17 of 18 patients reached the target office
trough bp of less than 130/80 mm hg. there also
were no differences in ambulatory systolic and
diastolic bp and daily protein and sodium intake
between treatments (p ⫽ 0.9; p ⫽ 0.1; p ⫽ 0.2;
and p ⫽ 0.3, respectively). renal function assessed by means of serum creatinine and egfr
remained stable during the study periods (p ⫽
0.6 and p ⫽ 0.9, respectively; table 2). a significant increase in pra was observed after treatment with triple raas blockade compared with
double raas blockade (p ⫽ 0.02; table 2). the
increment in pra was shown in 16 of 18 patients.
triple therapy provided an additional 55.37%
decrease in proteinuria; ie, 0.7 g/24 h (95%
confidence interval, 0.48 to 0.92) compared with
double raas blockade (anova p ⫽ 0.01; post

489

hoc p ⫽ 0.01; table 2). the decrease in proteinuria was shown in 16 of 18 patients. changes in
proteinuria did not correlate with changes in
systolic bp, diastolic bp, or pra. the addition
of spironolactone resulted in a significant decrease in urine nag (anova p ⫽ 0.006; post
hoc p ⫽ 0.02) and piiinp (anova p ⫽ 0.03;
post hoc p ⫽ 0.05) excretion compared with
double raas blockade (table 2). it was shown
in 15 and 16 of 18 patients, respectively. ␣1m
excretion decreased numerically after triple
raas blockade (p ⫽ 0.9).
the study treatments were well tolerated by
all patients. adverse effects were not reported in
questionnaires. there was a significant increase
in potassium levels after triple raas blockade
compared with baseline (anova p ⫽ 0.02; post
hoc p ⫽ 0.02; table 2). the increase in potassium levels after triple raas blockade was
shown in 10 of 18 patients. in 2 patients, potassium levels significantly increased to 5.7 and 5.9
mmol/l, respectively.

discussion
in the present study, we show that administration of the  xxxg1602xxx  antagonist spironolactone in addition to combination treatment
with an ace inhibitor and arb leads to a further
increase in raas blockade. a significant increase in pra was observed after triple raas
blockade, similar to other reports.18,19

macological raas blockade,10 or patients with
a particular type of nephropathy. the antiproteinuric effect of spironolactone seen in our study
confirms and extends findings of previous clinical studies in patients with nondiabetic ckd.15,20
in a double-blind placebo-controlled study performed in 41 patients with various ckds, chrysostomou and becker15 showed that the addition
of the  xxxg1602xxx  antagonist to an ace
inhibitor resulted in a 42% decrease in proteinuria that was sustained up to 12 months. of
interest, they showed for the first time that triple
therapy offered an advantage to double therapy
with an ace inhibitor and arb, causing a greater
proteinuria decrease by 32.5%. however, they
observed no differences between triple raas
blockade and a combination of ace inhibitor
and spironolactone. in a prospective randomized
open-label study, bianchi et al evaluated the
effects of spironolactone (25 mg/d for 1 y) on
proteinuria and egfr in 83 patients with ckd
already treated with an ace inhibitor and/or
arb.14 after 1 year of therapy, proteinuria and
aldosterone levels decreased significantly. their
subgroup analysis performed in 43 individuals
treated with a combination of an ace inhibitor
and arb showed that the addition of an aldoste-

triple raas blockade as a nephroprotection

rone receptor antagonist to double raas blockade may provide an additional significant decrease in proteinuria by even 43%.
unfortunately, the study of chrysostomou and
becker,15 although very interesting, did not use
an ace inhibitor and arb in their maximal
recommended doses; therefore, it did not answer
the crucial question about whether triple raas
blockade provided additional renoprotection in
comparison to combination ace-inhibitor and
arb therapy. in the report by bianchi et al, there
was no information about doses of the ace
inhibitor and arb used in the study.14 the
particular strength of our study is to observe a
decrease in proteinuria when spironolactone was
added to double raas blockade using an ace
inhibitor and arb in maximal recommended
hypotensive doses. these findings point toward a
potential benefit of blockade of all components
of the raas with the use of an aldosterone
receptor antagonist, ace inhibitor, and arb as a
new promising nephroprotective strategy to effectively decrease the deleterious actions of both
 xxxg99xxx  and aldosterone in patients with
ckd. one may speculate about whether increasing doses of an ace inhibitor and/or arb to
greater than commonly recommended levels may
provide additional nephroprotection. aranda et al21
showed that a high dose of  xxxd3303xxx  (ie, 160
mg) produced a greater decrease in proteinuria
than the standard dose of 80 mg. these findings
indicate that maximal recommended hypotensive doses of an arb may be not optimal in the
aspect of nephroprotection. of interest also may
be the issue of whether divided or bedtime administration of raas blockers may provide a better
antiproteinuric response in a comparison with a
1-time morning administration of the same daily
doses of these agents.22
several mechanisms may be involved in the
antiproteinuric effect of aldosterone blockade.
first, as a result of differential effects on the
afferent and efferent glomerular arterioles,9 aldosterone could increase intraglomerular pressure,
an action independent of that of  xxxg99xxx .
using isolated afferent and efferent arterioles
from rabbit kidneys, arima et al9 showed that
aldosterone exerted a vasoconstriction action on
both the afferent and efferent arterioles, but the
sensitivity of the efferent arterioles to aldosterone was greater than that of the afferent arte-

491

rioles. another potential mechanism incorporates the ability of aldosterone to potentiate the
pressor effects of  xxxg99xxx  as a result of
upregulation of  xxxg99xxx  receptors in vascular smooth muscle cells.8
worthy of analysis is the issue of whether
the renal benefit of additional aldosterone blockade lies in its diuretic effect or its ability to
modulate the non–volume-mediated effects of
aldosterone. one should realize that the addition
of a diuretic to pharmacological blockade of the
raas may decrease proteinuria further.23 to
reduce the influence of sodium-dependent mechanisms on study results, all subjects received an
unchanged dose of diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide,
during all periods of the study. in addition, patients were instructed not to change their daily
sodium intake during study periods. sodium excretion was monitored and found not to change
during all study phases, which may suggest that
the renal effect of spironolactone was not caused
by diuretic effects of the drug. of course, we
cannot completely exclude such a mechanism.
to solve the problem, a study design involving
direct comparison of renal effects of spironolactone and a diuretic without aldosterone antagonism properties in addition to double pharmacological raas blockade should be adopted.
no clinical evidence is available about whether
the addition of an  xxxg1602xxx  antagonist can inhibit the long-term progression of
ckd to end-stage failure. promising pilot data
recently were published by bianchi et al, who
showed that the monthly rate of decrease in
egfr from baseline was lower in patients treated
with combined raas blockade including spironolactone than in controls without an  xxxg1602xxx  antagonist.14 in a proteinuriainduced renal damage model, a combination of
ace inhibitor and spironolactone recently was
shown to decrease tubular damage and prevent
kidney fibrosis,24 fundamental predictors of kidney outcome.25 to evaluate tubulointerstitial effects of our interventions, the tubular involvement markers nag and ␣1m and an indirect
marker of kidney fibrosis, piiinp, were analyzed.
a close association between urinary piiinp excretion and degree of interstitial fibrosis previously was evidenced.26 during the synthesis and
deposition of type iii collagen, piiinp is degraded from the collagen and secreted into the

492

surroundings. the increased excretion of nag is
believed to be a specific marker of tubular injury
in many renal pathological states, including nondiabetic ckd.27 increased urinary excretion of
␣1m, a low-molecular-weight protein physiologically filtered and reabsorbed by tubular cells,
might indicate the decreased capacity of its reabsorption by such cells and might be the marker of
established tubular damage, with greater urinary
concentrations pointing to greater severity of
damage.28 in the present study, triple raas
blockade was shown to decrease both nag and
piiinp compared with double raas blockade,
and these effects were completely independent
of bp changes. decreased ␣1m levels also were
observed; however, the difference did not reach
the significance level. these beneficial renal effects may contribute to the decrease in tubulotoxic proteinuria, as well as direct nonhemodynamic consequences of aldosterone antagonism,
including decreased production of such prosclerotic cytokines as transforming growth factor ␤1,
plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, and decreased macrophage infiltration, processes involved in the development of fibrosis.29 thus,
we expanded the evidence of the beneficial renal
impact of triple raas blockade beyond looking
at proteinuria.
a potential limitation of the study is the relatively small sample size, which is sufficiently
powered to detect a significant difference equal
to the sd value between treatment periods.
twenty-four–hour urine collections used to assess proteinuria may be associated with significant collection errors, largely because of improper timing and missed samples, leading to
overcollection and undercollection. another limitation may be the relatively short treatment periods, during which beneficial tubulointerstitial
effects may not yet fully develop. in addition,
one should realize that the potential benefits for
tubules and interstitium were extrapolated from
presumptive early surrogates. evidence may be
provided by only histological examination.
side effects of triple raas blockade also
need to be considered. there is potential risk of
life-threatening hyperkalemia during aldosterone
receptor blockade, particular when patients are
treated with other agents that increase potassium
levels, such as ace inhibitors and arbs.30 because the risk of hyperkalemia is clearly dose

tylicki et al

dependent, we used a low dose of spironolactone. in addition, only patients with normal or
slightly impaired kidney function were included
in the study. within this regimen, triple raas
blockade induced only moderate hyperkalemia.
although hyperkalemia was not a clinical problem in our study, we do not advocate the use of
triple raas blockade without careful screening
and ongoing monitoring of candidate patients.
there were no reports of antiandrogen side effects in our study, but it is necessary to note that
exposure time was short.
in summary, we found that an aldosterone
receptor antagonist in addition to recommended
renoprotective treatment using combination
therapy with an ace inhibitor and arb, socalled triple raas blockade, decreased proteinuria and urine excretion of proteins associated
with tubular damage and interstitial renal fibrosis
and thus may have a beneficial effect on the
outcome of patients with proteinuric nondiabetic
ckd.
