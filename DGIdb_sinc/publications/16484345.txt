abstract
mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) from bone marrow are
believed to be an ideal cell source for cardiomyoplasty;
however, cellular electrophysiology is not understood. the
present study was designed to investigate ion channels in
undifferentiated rat mscs. it was found that three types of
outward currents were present in rat mscs, including a
small portion of ca2ⴙ-activated kⴙ channel (ikca) sensitive
to inhibition by iberiotoxin and/or clotromazole, a delayed
rectifier kⴙ current (ikdr), and a transient outward kⴙ
current (ito). in addition, tetrodotoxin (ttx)-sensitive sodium current (ina.ttx) and  xxxd2722xxx -sensitive l-type ca2ⴙ

current (ica.l) were found in a small population of rat
mscs. moreover, reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction revealed the molecular evidence of mrna for the
functional ionic currents, including slo and  xxxg1267xxx  for
ikca;  xxxg1233xxx  for ito;  xxxg1231xxx  and  xxxg1237xxx  for ikdr;  xxxg2022xxx  for
ina.ttx; and  xxxg311xxx  for ica.l. these results demonstrate
for the first time that multiple functional ion channel currents (i.e., ikca, ito, ikdr, ina.ttx, and ica.l) are present in
rat mscs from bone marrow; however, physiological roles
of these ion channels remain to be studied. stem cells

introduction

in mscs. the present study was therefore designed to investigate properties of ionic channel currents in undifferentiated rat
mscs from bone marrow.

ion channels are extensively expressed in different types of cells
and play important roles in maintaining physiological homeostasis. in proliferative cells, ion channels participate in cell proliferation [1, 2]. it has been demonstrated that ion channels modulate the progression through the cell cycle [1] and that k⫹
channel expression changes with cell cycle progression [3]. the
highly proliferative mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) from bone
marrow have been studied recently in different species. mscs
cultured and expanded in vitro with bone marrow from different
species (e.g., mice, rats, and humans) showed multilineage
potential [4 –7] to incorporate into a variety of tissues, including
bone, cartilage, muscle, lung, and spleen, after systemic injection [5, 6, 8], and they were also found to form other kinds of
cells in vitro, for example, hepatocytes, cardiomyocytes, and
neuronal cells [4, 5, 9]. in particular, mscs have been used for
cardiomyoplasty, and experimental studies have demonstrated
that transplantation of mscs to infarcted myocardium significantly improves heart function [10 –12]. therefore, it is believed
that mscs are an ideal cell source for myocardial regeneration
[13, 14]. however, cellular electrophysiology is not understood

and

methods

msc culture
rat mscs were isolated with a modified procedure as described
previously [5, 15]. briefly, sprague-dawley rats (150 –210 g)
were sacrificed by neck dislocation according to the guideline of
animal care and use committee for teaching and research of
university of hong kong. bone marrow was collected from the
femurae and tibiae of the animal with a 18-gauge needle under
sterile conditions, suspended in a 15-ml test tube containing
dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem; invitrogen,
hong kong sar, china, http://www.invitrogen.com), and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 minutes. the marrow pellet was
washed in hanks’  xxxd2988xxx , centrifuged at 1,000
rpm for 10 minutes, and then resuspended in dmem. nucleated
cells were isolated with a density gradient percoll by centrifuging at 14,000 rpm for 12 minutes at 8°c and collecting top 60%

of the gradient, and they were washed with the complete culture
medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs; invitrogen),
penicillin (100 u/ml), streptomycin (100 ␮g/ml), and  xxxd164xxx  (0.25 ␮g/ml). the cells were then seeded to a 25-cm2
tissue culture flask and incubated with the medium as described
above with 10 ng/ml leukemia inhibition factor (invitrogen) at
37°c in a humidified atmosphere of 5% co2 and 95% air.
nonadherent cells were removed by changing the medium after
24 hours. the culture medium was changed twice a week
thereafter. for subculture, cells were detached with 0.25% trypsin and 1 mm ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)n,n,n⬘,n⬘-tetraacetic acid (egta) and passaged at ratio of 1:3
plates when cells grew to 80%–90% confluence. for recording
ion channel currents, the detached cells were suspended in the
culture medium, transferred to a cell chamber for 15–20 minutes, allowed to attach to the bottom of the cell chamber, and
subsequently superfused with normal tyrode’s solution (⬃1.5
ml/minute).

osteogenic differentiation and alkaline
phosphatase staining
osteogenic differentiation was performed with the cells from
the first passage. briefly, rat mscs were cultured in six-well
plates (for cytochemistry stain) at a density of 4 ⫻ 104 cells per
well or 96-well plates (for alkaline phosphatase assay) at a
density of 104 cells per well for 24 hours. the cells were then
exposed to the medium containing osteogenic supplements: 10
nm dexamethasone, 0.05 mm l- xxxd228xxx  2-phosphate, and
10 mm sodium ␤-glycerophosphate, whereas leukemia inhibition factor was omitted. the cells for the negative control were
cultured with normal medium.
cytochemistry stain of alkaline phosphatase was performed
in rat mscs grown in six-well plates for 12 days. the cells were
rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and
then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room
temperature. the fixed cells were rinsed with 3⫻ pbs and then
with 1⫻ pbs. alkaline-dye mixture was added to the dish and
incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. after cells were
rinsed thoroughly in deionized water, the cells were treated with
mayer’s hematoxylin solution for 10 minutes, rinsed with deionized water, and then air-dried before the examination and/or
image was taken under an inverted phase-contrast microscope
(ix50; olympus, tokyo, http://www.olympus-global.com).
alkaline phosphatase activity was determined in rat mscs
cultured (for 12 days) with or without osteogenic supplements.
the cells in 96-well plates were rinsed twice with 0.2 ml of
pbs, and then 0.1 ml of alkaline phosphatase substrate solution
(containing 5 mm  xxxd2822xxx , 50 mm glycine, and
1 mm mgcl2, ph 10.5) was added to each well. after a
10-minute incubation, the reaction was terminated with an equal
volume of 1 m naoh. alkaline phosphatase activity was measured by the reaction product  xxxd2821xxx  using a microplate
reader (stl rainbow; tecan systems inc., san jose, ca). the
concentration of enzyme was determined against a standard
curve made from  xxxd2821xxx .

adipogenic differentiation and oil red o staining
adipogenic differentiation was conducted in rat mscs (from
passage 3) seeded into six-well plates at a density of 2 ⫻ 105
cells per well. the cells were cultured until confluence, and the

culture medium was changed to the adipogenic induction supplement medium (high glucose dmem containing 10% fbs, 10
␮g/ml insulin; invitrogen), 0.5 mm  xxxd2388xxx , 1
␮m dexamethasone ( xxxd1853xxx   xxxd1854xxx ; merck & co., whitehouse station, ny, http://www.merck.com), and 100 ␮m indomethacin
(sigma-aldrich, st. louis, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com) for 3
days and subsequently to the adipogenic maintenance medium
(high-glucose dmem containing 10% fbs, 10 ␮g/ml insulin)
for 1 day. this procedure was repeated three times, and then the
cells were incubated in the maintenance medium for 7 days. the
treated rat mscs were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
after rinsing with pbs, stained with oil red o solution (sigmaaldrich) for 20 minutes at room temperature, and washed again
with pbs for a microscopic view of the lipid accumulation.

solutions
tyrode’s solution contained 136 mm nacl, 5.4 mm kcl, 1.0
mm mgcl2, 1.8 mm cacl2, 0.33 mm nah2po4, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid (hepes); ph adjusted to 7.4 with naoh. the pipette
solution contained 20 mm kcl, 110 mm k-aspartate, 1.0 mm
mgcl2, 10 mm hepes, 0.05 mm egta (or 5 mm where
specified), 0.1 mm gtp, 5.0 mm na2-phosphocreatine, 5.0 mm
mg2-atp; ph adjusted to 7.2 with koh. k⫹ in superfusion and
pipette solutions was replaced by equimolar cs⫹ when k⫹-free
conditions were applied for recording sodium current (ina) or
l-type ca2⫹ current (ica.l). the experiments were conducted at
room temperature (21–22°c).

electrophysiology
the whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used. borosilicate
glass electrodes (1.2 mm o.d.) were pulled with a brownflaming puller (model p-97; sutter instrument co., novato,
ca) and had tip resistances of 2–3 m⍀ when filled with pipette
solution. the tip potentials were compensated for before the
pipette touched the cell. after a gigaohm-seal was obtained by
negative suction, the cell membrane was ruptured by gentle
suction to establish the whole-cell configuration. data were
acquired with an epc9 amplifier (heka, lambrecht, germany).
membrane currents were low-pass filtered at 2 khz and stored
on the hard disk of an ibm-compatible computer.

reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
total rna of rat mscs (from passages 2–3) was isolated using
trizol method (invitrogen) and further treated with dnase i
(invitrogen). reverse transcription (rt) was performed with the
rt system (promega, madison, wi, http://www.promega.com)
protocol in a 20-␮l reaction mixture. rna (1 ␮g) was used in
the reaction, and a combination of oligo(dt) and random hexamer primers was used for the initiation of cdna synthesis.
after this rt procedure, the reaction mixture (cdna) was used
for polymerase chain reaction (pcr).
the forward and reverse pcr oligonucleotide primers chosen to amplify the cdna are listed in table 1. pcr was
performed by a promega pcr system with taq polymerase and
accompanying buffers. the cdna in 2-␮l aliquots was amplified by a dna thermal cycler (mycycler; bio-rad, hercules,
ca, http://www.bio-rad.com) in a 25-␮l reaction mixture containing 1.0⫻ thermophilic dna polymerase reaction buffer,
1.25 mm mgcl2, 0.2 mm each deoxynucleotide triphosphate

taq polymerase under the following conditions: the mixture was
annealed at 50 – 60°c (1 minute), extended at 72°c (2 minutes),
and denatured at 95°c (45 s) for 30 to 32 cycles. this was
followed by a final extension at 72°c (10 minutes) to ensure
complete product extension. the pcr products were electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel, and the amplified cdna

osteogenesis and adipogenisis of rat mscs and
families of ion channel currents

of the first seeding of bone marrow cells, showing mostly
spindle-like or triangle-shaped cells (left panel). the cells from
the first passage reached confluence on day 10 (right panel).

after 12 days of culture with the medium containing osteogenic
supplements, the cells formed significant alkaline phosphatasepositive aggregates (fig. 1b, right panel), and no positive stain
for alkaline phosphatase was observed in control cells cultured
with normal medium (fig. 1b, left panel). in addition, alkaline
phosphatase activity was significantly increased (from 0.11 ⫾
0.01 pm/minute for control to 0.73 ⫾ 0.01 nm/minute; n ⫽ 44;
p ⬍ .01). figure 1c shows the adipogenic differentiation of rat
mscs. the oil red o staining for the lipid accumulation was
significant in rat mscs treated with adipogenic supplements,
whereas no lipid staining was observed in control rat mscs.
these results suggest that rat mscs exhibit the potency to
differentiate into bone cells or adipocytes in vitro.
figure 2 illustrates families of membrane currents in undifferentiated rat mscs. the currents were recorded with the
voltage protocol as shown in the inset (fig. 2a). a gradually
activating current like a delayed rectifier k⫹ current (ikdr) was
recorded in a representative rat msc upon the depolarizing
voltage steps, and a significant noisy oscillation like ca2⫹activated k⫹ current (ikca) was observed at ⫹40 to ⫹60 mv,
suggesting that two types of currents (ikdr and ikca) are
co-expressed in this cell. figure 2b displays current traces
recorded in a typical experiment, showing an inward current
followed by ikdr with a significant tail current, whereas figure
2c shows a transient outward current recorded in another cell,
similar to transient outward k⫹ current (ito) observed in cardiac

and neuronal cells [16 –18]. almost all rat mscs investigated
(168 of 184 cells, from different dishes of passages 2– 4) demonstrated ikdr currents activated by the voltage protocols; cells
with significant noisy-like current were found in 33% (61 of 184
cells), and ito was found in 10% (18 of 184 cells) of rat mscs.
inward current was coexistent with outward currents (e.g., ikdr
or ito) in 16% of rat mscs (30 of 184 cells). mean value of
membrane capacitance was 45 ⫾ 12 pf. in addition, rat mscs
were found to have membrane potentials between ⫺13 and ⫺55
mv in current clamp made.

inward currents
figure 3a illustrates current traces recorded in a representative
cell with k⫹ pipette solution in tyrode’s solution. a significant
inward current was followed by gradually activating ikdr.
tetrodotoxin (ttx; 100 nm) abolished the inward current, and
the effect recovered upon the drug washout for 5 minutes,
suggesting that the inward current may be ttx-sensitive ina.
figure 3b displays the time course of ina recorded under
k⫹-free conditions in a representative rat msc with 30-ms

inset (0.2 hz). (a): two components of outward currents are present in
a rat msc, one rapidly activating current, such as delayed rectifier k⫹
current (ikdr), at potentials from ⫺20 to ⫹30 mv, and another with
noisy oscillation, such as ca2⫹-activated k⫹ current, at potentials from
⫹40 to ⫹60 mv. (b): a significant inward current was followed by
ikdr with significant tail current recorded from another rat msc. (c):
transient outward k⫹ current was observed in a different rat msc.

current traces at corresponding time points are shown at the
right of the panel. ttx-sensitive ina (ina.ttx) was recorded in
five of 26 cells.
we found that a ttx-resistant inward current, sensitive to
inhibition by the ica.l blocker  xxxd2722xxx  (10 ␮m; fig. 3c), was
present in two of 26 cells (8%), suggesting that dihydropyridinesensitive ica.l, as recently reported in human mscs [19], is
present in a small population of rat mscs.

ito in rat mscs
ito was detected in a small population (⬃10%) of rat mscs.

5 minutes. ttx reversibly abolished the inward transient without affecting outward current, suggesting that the inward current is a ttxsensitive na⫹ current (ina.ttx). (b): time course of ina.ttx recorded

ikca in rat mscs
three types of ikca have been described in different types of
cells and defined by the use of selective ikca channel blockers
[20 –23]. ikca was studied in rat mscs showing significant
noisy oscillation current. figure 5a shows current traces recorded in a representative cell with the voltage protocol shown

application of 100 nm iberiotoxin (alomone, jerusalem, israel,
http://www.alomone.com), a blocker of big conductance ikca,
and the remaining current was substantially inhibited by 5 mm
 xxxd1804xxx . inhibition fraction of the membrane current was 14% by
iberiotoxin and 74% by  xxxd1804xxx  (n ⫽ 9), suggesting that big
conductance ikca was co-existent with ikdr in rat mscs.
in some rat mscs, iberiotoxin had no effect on the membrane current; however,  xxxd1732xxx  (a relatively selective inhibitor of intermediate conductance ikca channels [23]) showed
an inhibitory effect. figure 5b displays i-v relation curves
recorded in another cell by a 2-second voltage ramp from ⫺120
to ⫹60 mv (holding potential, ⫺40 mv). iberiotoxin at 100 nm
had no effect on the inward and outward components of the
membrane current elicited by the ramp protocol, whereas 1 ␮m
 xxxd1732xxx  partially decreased both inward and outward components of the currents. co-application of  xxxd1732xxx  with 5
mm  xxxd1804xxx  substantially suppressed the remaining current. similar results were obtained in 11 of 20 cells, suggesting that
intermediate conductance ikca, not big conductance ikca, is
copresent with ikdr in these rat mscs. in addition, we found
that in a few of cells (n ⫽ 3) the membrane currents showed
inhibitory response to both iberiotoxin and  xxxd1732xxx , and the
remaining current was suppressed by 5 mm  xxxd1804xxx .
in another set of experiments, the small conductance ikca
inhibitor apamin (alomone) was applied to test whether small
conductance ikca would be present in rat mscs. apamin at 100

nm had no effect on the membrane current in all cells tested
(n ⫽ 6). these results suggest that big and/or intermediate
conductance ikca, but not small conductance ikca, are heterogeneously co-expressed with ikdr in rat mscs.
ikca was further studied in rat mscs by the application of
the ionophore  xxxd2379xxx  in bath solution to increase intracellular ca2⫹. figure 5c shows the membrane current recorded in
a typical experiment with the ramp protocol as in figure 5b.
 xxxd2379xxx  at 1 ␮m remarkably enhanced both inward and
outward components of the membrane current with weak inward
rectification and shifted the reversal potential to hyperpolarization. the current was not affected by iberiotoxin but was completely reversed by application of 1 ␮m  xxxd1732xxx , and the
remaining current was inhibited by 5 mm  xxxd1804xxx . density of the

these results suggest that the current activated by  xxxd2379xxx  is
most likely intermediate conductance ikca. in addition, membrane potential (measured in current clamp) was increased from

hyperpolarizes membrane potential significantly.

ikdr was assessed in nine cells with 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mm
tea and fitted to the hill equation: e ⫽ emax/[1 ⫹ (ic50/c)b],
where e is the inhibition of ikdr in percent at concentration c,
emax is the maximum inhibition, ic50 is the concentration for
half-maximum action, and b is the hill coefficient. the ic50 was
3.2 ⫾ 0.2 mm with a b of 1.2 ⫾ 0.1 on the basis of cell-by-cell
fits. in addition,  xxxd1804xxx  also suppressed ikdr (fig. 5) in a
concentration-dependent manner (0.1–10 mm; n ⫽ 10). the
ic50 was 2.2 ⫾ 0.3 mm, and b was 1.3 ⫾ 0.1.
to study the properties of ikdr, we analyzed voltage and time
dependence of the current. figure 6b displays the i-v relationships
of ikdr tail current measured at ⫺30 mv and step current in rat
mscs under control conditions. the current activated at potentials
positive to ⫺20 mv, and showed a linear i-v relation of step
current. the tail current reached a steady-state level at ⫹40 and
⫹60 mv. the activation conductance g/gmax of ikdr was obtained
by normalizing tail current (fig. 6c) and fitted to boltzmann
distribution. midpoint (v0.5) of ikdr activation was ⫹1.5 ⫾ 0.2
mv, and slope factor was 9.1 ⫾ 0.3 (n ⫽ 18).
ikdr exhibited a slow inactivation when a longer depolarization voltage step (4 s) was applied (fig. 6d). data for
inactivation process of the current elicited by 4-s voltage steps
to between ⫺10 and ⫹60 mv from ⫺80 mv was fitted to
mono-exponential functions. the averaged values for voltage
dependence of inactivation time constant are shown in figure
6e; they suggest that the inactivation time constant increases as
the current amplitude augments (p ⬍ .01; n ⫽ 16).
the voltage protocol and representative recordings used to
assess voltage-dependent inactivation (availability) of ikdr are
illustrated in figure 7a. figure 7b illustrates availability curves
of ikdr with 1-s and 4-s conditioning potentials. the current
was inactivated to maximal at 0 mv (but incompletely even with
4-s conditioning pulses) and rebounded at potentials positive to
0 mv, showing an “u-shaped” inactivation curve with 1-s or 4-s
conditioning potentials, which is similar to that observed in
cloned  xxxg1237xxx  channels [24]. the decline limb of the inactivation
curve with 4-s conditioning pulses was fitted to boltzmann
distribution with v0.5 of ⫺27.6 ⫾ 0.6 mv, and the slope factor
was ⫺11.7 ⫾ 0.2 (n ⫽ 18).
figure 7c illustrates the current traces and voltage protocol
used to determine recovery kinetics of ikdr from inactivation,
and figure 7d shows the mean data of recovery of ikdr from
inactivation fitted to a bi-exponential function. on the basis of
cell-by-cell fits, the recovery time constants for recovery of
ikdr from inactivation were 85.2 ⫾ 5.2 and 989.7 ⫾ 51.2 ms
for ␶1 and ␶2, respectively (n ⫽ 17). figure 7e displays representative ikdr traces recorded with  xxxd3426xxx -ms pulse from ⫺80 to
⫹50 mv in a rat msc from the 1st, 5th, 10th, and 20th pulses
at 1 hz. ikdr was clearly smaller during the 5th, 10th, and 20th
pulses than during the first pulse. figure 7f shows mean values
of changes in ikdr during each beat expressed as a function of
the first pulse at each frequency. significant use-dependent
reduction of ikdr was noted at frequencies ⬎0.1 hz (n ⫽ 15;

discussion
in the present study, we found that rat mscs from bone marrow
showed the potential to differentiate to bone cells and fat cells as
reported previously [5, 25]. importantly, we demonstrated that
multiple ionic currents were present in undifferentiated rat
mscs from bone marrow, including voltage-gated ina, ica.l, ito,
ikdr, and ikca. ikdr was inhibited by  xxxd1804xxx  or tea, ito was
blocked by  xxxd1804xxx , and ikca was suppressed by iberiotoxin and/or
 xxxd1732xxx , whereas ina was blocked by ttx, and ica.l was
blocked by  xxxd2722xxx . rt-pcr revealed the evidence for
mrna species that likely encodes each of these ion channels.

ionic currents in rat mscs
mscs were used for a number of years in the investigation
of cell therapy and differentiation [4, 8, 26, 27]; however,
information for ionic channel expression has not been well
documented. kawano et al. [28, 29] first demonstrated ionic
homogeneity in human mscs and found that ca2⫹ oscillations
regulated by na⫹-ca2⫹ exchanger and plasma membrane ca2⫹
pump could induce fluctuations of membrane current and potentials in human mscs. in addition, they found that ikca was
present in most of the cells and that  xxxd2722xxx -sensitive ica.l
was present in a small population (15%) of human mscs [29].
the evidence for the expression of big conductance of ikca and
ica.l in human mscs was further supported by heubach et al.
[30]. our recent study demonstrated that in addition to ikca and
ica.l, three more functional ionic channel currents (i.e., ito,
ina.ttx, and heag1) were present in undifferentiated human
mscs [19]. the present observation demonstrated the additional
information that multiple ion channel currents were also present
in undifferentiated rat mscs.
ina in rat mscs was recorded in a small population of cells,
and was sensitive to blockade by ttx (fig. 3). therefore, the
current would be ttx-sensitive ina (ina.ttx). the presence of
mrna expression for the ttx-sensitive na⫹ channel gene
 xxxg2022xxx  further supported the observation that ina.ttx was expressed in rat mscs (fig. 8). ica.l was found in 2 of 26 (8%) rat
mscs, and the current was sensitive to inhibition by  xxxd2722xxx 
(fig. 3c). moreover,  xxxg311xxx  mrna was significant in rat mscs
(fig. 8). these results indicate that ina.ttx and ica.l, as in human
mscs [19], are present in a small population of rat mscs.
ito in rat mscs was sensitive to inhibition by  xxxd1804xxx  (fig. 4)
as observed in neuronal, smooth muscle, and cardiac cells
[16 –18, 31]. it is generally believed that ito is encoded by
 xxxg1233xxx ,  xxxg1243xxx , and/or  xxxg1244xxx . a significant level of  xxxg1233xxx 
mrna was found in rat mscs (fig. 5), suggesting that ito in rat
mscs may be encoded by  xxxg1233xxx . however, contribution of
 xxxg1243xxx  could not be excluded. ito in human mscs was found to
be mainly encoded by  xxxg1243xxx  [19].
we found that ikca was not a single component in rat mscs
(fig. 5). the currents showed characteristics of 1) noisy-like
current traces at more-positive potentials, and 2) sensitivity to
inhibition by the specific big conductance ikca blocker iberiotoxin (fig. 5a) and/or the intermediate conductance ikca
blocker  xxxd1732xxx  (fig. 5b). in addition, the current elicited
by the ionophore  xxxd2379xxx  showed weak inward rectification
and inhibition by  xxxd1732xxx , typical of intermediate conductance ikca. significant expression of slo and  xxxg1267xxx  mrna
(fig. 8) supports the notion that two types of ikca (i.e., big and
intermediate conductance ca2⫹-activated k⫹ channels) are heterogeneously present in some rat mscs; however, they usually
co-exist with ikdr in these cells.
ikdr in rat mscs (figs. 6, 7) was sensitive to inhibition by
tea or  xxxd1804xxx , and showed significant inactivation, slow recovery from inactivation, and “u-shaped” voltage-dependent inactivation. these properties are similar to those observed in cloned
 xxxg1237xxx  channels [24]. rt-pcr further revealed high-level expression of  xxxg1231xxx  and  xxxg1237xxx  mrna (fig. 8), suggesting that
 xxxg1231xxx  and  xxxg1237xxx  possibly contribute to ikdr in rat mscs.
taken collectively, ina.ttx, ica.l, and ito in rat mscs, as in
human mscs [19], were detected in a small population of cells,
whereas ikdr was found in most rat mscs. however, ikdr in
rat mscs was clearly different from that in human mscs [19].

li, deng, sun et al.

the ikdr in rat mscs showed remarkable inactivation with
longer depolarization steps, “u-shaped” inactivation, and slow
recovery from inactivation. nevertheless, the ikdr in human
mscs had no time- and voltage-dependent inactivation [19].
the possible molecular base of ikpr is  xxxg1231xxx  and  xxxg1237xxx  for rat
mscs, whereas for human mscs it is heag1 [19]. in addition,
big conductance ikca was present in most of human mscs [19],
whereas both big and intermediate conductance ikca were heterogeneously present in some rat mscs. these differences
likely imply species variation.
cell transplantation is believed to be a promising treatment
strategy for myocardial regeneration. mscs have been currently
used as a cell source for this purpose [10, 13, 14, 32]. however,
studies have raised concerns as to whether observed arrhythmic
events are a consequence of the intervention or the natural
history of underlying disease [33, 34]. understanding ion channel expression in undifferentiated mscs will be helpful in
seeking possible biological solutions to these concerns and
medical challenges. the present observation focused on ion
channel expression and demonstrated that multiple ion channels
were present in rat mscs, which provides a base for future
investigations to avoid the possibility of threatening the promising treatment program.
ionic channels modulate cell cycling in proliferative cells
[1]. it was reported that ina could play a role in the proliferation
of astrocytes [35] and cancer cells [36, 37]. k⫹ channel expression was found to be changed with cell cycle progression [3],
and k⫹ channel blockade was antiproliferative in numerous
types of proliferative cells, such as cancer cells [1, 3], tlymphocyte [38], and vascular smooth muscle cells [20].

however, little information is available in the literature regarding physiological roles of ion channels in mscs, which remains
to be studied in the future.
differential expression of the inward and outward currents
in individual cells likely suggests the cells investigated are not
from a homogeneous population of rat mscs but are from, for
example, cells at different phases of the cell cycle. it was
reported that ion channel expression changed with cell cycle
progression [3, 39]. in addition, fractions of more or less of
committed progenitor cells would also affect the expression
pattern of ion channels [30, 40]. the heterogeneous expression
of ion channels was also described recently in human mscs [19,
30]. the mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of ion channels in both human and rat mscs remain to be studied.
in summary, the present study demonstrates for the first time
that five distinct ion channel currents are found in undifferentiated rat mscs, including three types of outward currents (ikca,
ito, and ikdr) and two types of inward currents (ina.ttx and
ica.l). the information obtained from the present study provides
strong basis for investigating how these functional ion channels
regulate biological and physiological activity and differentiation
of mscs in the future.
