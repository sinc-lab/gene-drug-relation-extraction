abstract
the crystal structure of  xxxg766xxx  (fru-1,6-pase;  xxxg766xxx ) complexed with zn2+
and two allosteric regulators, amp and fructose 2,6bisphosphate (fru-2,6-p2) has been determined at 2.0-a resolution. in the refined model, the crystallographic r factor is
0.189 with rms deviations of 0.014 a and 2.80 from ideal
geometries for bond lengths and bond angles, respectively. a
15° rotation is observed between the upper dimer c1c2 and the
lower dimer c3c4 relative to the r-form structure (fructose
6-phosphate complex), consistent with that expected from a
t-form structure. the major difference between the structure
of the previously determined fru-2,6-p2 complex (r form) and
that of the current quaternary t-form complex lies in the active
site domain. a zinc binding site distinct from the three binding
sites established earlier was identified within each monomer.
helix h4 (residues 123-127) was found to be better defined
than in previously studied ligated fru-1,6-pase structures.
interactions between monomers in the active site domain were
found involving h4 residues from one monomer and residues
tyr-258 and arg-243 from the adjacent monomer. cooperativity between amp and fru-2,6-p2 in signal transmission
probably involves the following features: an amp site, the
adjacent b3 strand (residues 113-118), the metal site, the
immediate active site, the short helix h4 (residues 123-127),
and tyr-258 and arg-243 from the adjacent monomer within
the upper (or lower) dimer. the closest distance between the
immediate active site and that on the adjacent monomer is only
5 a. thus, the involvement of h4 in signal transmission adds
another important pathway to the scheme of the allosteric
mechanism of fru-1,6-pase.

 xxxg766xxx  (fru-1,6-pase,  xxxg766xxx )
catalyzes the hydrolysis of d- xxxd2164xxx  to
d-fructose 6-phosphate (fru-6-p) and inorganic phosphate (1,
2). divalent metal ions, such as mg2+, mn2+, co2+, or2+
are required for catalytic activity (1, 3).
as a key enzyme in the gluconeogenesis pathway, fru1,6-pase is regulated by two inhibitors: amp and fructose
2,6-bisphosphate (fru-2,6-p2) (2, 4-7). both amp and fru2,6-p2 also act as strong activators for phosphofrucokinase,
a major regulatory enzyme in the opposing glycolytic pathway. normally, there is a relatively stable amp pool under
in vivo conditions. in contrast, the fru-2,6-p2 concentration,
which signals the level of glucagon (inversely) and glucose
(proportionally), is subject to a wide range of fluctuation (8).
therefore, the modulation by fru-2,6-p2 is ordinarily more
physiologically relevant to the coordinated control of the two
reciprocal processes, glycolysis and glyconeogenesis. in
addition, synergistic interaction is observed for inhibition by
amp and fru-2,6-p2 (4, 7, 9). plausible mechanisms for this

synergistic interaction between amp and fru-2,6-p2 have
recently been considered (10, 11).
pig kidney fru-1,6-pase is a tetramer having d2 symmetry.
each of the four monomers has 335 amino acids. crystallographic studies of complexes of fru-1,6-pase established two
quaternary conformations, the r and the t forms, which
differ by a 170 rotation of the lower dimer c3c4 relative to the
upper dimer c1c2 (12-14). the r-form structures include
fru-1,6-pase complexed with fru-6-p (2.1-a resolution) (15),
fru-2,6-p2 (2.6-a resolution) (11),  xxxd2164xxx 
(2.5-a resolution), 2,5-anhydroglucitol 1,6-bisphosphate
(ahg-1,6-p2, 2.6- to 3.0-a resolution), and 2,5-anhydromannitol 1,6-bisphosphate (2.6- to 3.0-a resolution) (16). the
t-form structures include the amp complex 2.5-a resolution)
(17) and the fru-6-p-amp-mg complex (2.5-a resolution) (12).
kinetic and structural results show that binding of amp
alone at an allosteric site is sufficient to lock the enzyme into
the t form. however, binding of inhibitors, such as fru-6-p
and fru-2,6-p2, to the active site in the r form does not
change the quaternary structure to the t form.
by using the refined structure of fru-1,6-pase complexed
with fru-2,6-p2, amp, and zn2+t that we report here, we
make comparisons with other structures of ligated fru-1,6pase. we show that the helix h4 (residues 123-127) becomes
more ordered in this fru-2,6-p2, amp, and zn2+ complex,
and we provide a pathway from this helix to the active site,
the adjacent monomer, and the amp site via b3 strand of
,3-structure. the interactions involving residues in h4 probably contribute to the synergistic inhibition between amp
and fru-2,6-p2 and to the observed positive cooperativity of
substrate binding when fru-2,6-p2 binds (4, 7).
methods
pig kidney fru-1,6-pase was purified as described (12-14).
crystals of the enzyme complexed with amp, fru-2,6-p2,
and zn2+ were obtained by dialyzing protein at 15-17 mg/ml
against 20 mm tris.hcl/1.0 mm amp/0.2 mm fru-2,6-p2/6

size of 0.8 x 0.8 x 1.2 mm3 were obtained after 1 week of
dialysis. before being mounted for data collection, the crystals were soaked in the crystallization solution, which was
changed six times during 35 h at 4°c. the fru-2,6-p2 was
freshly made before each change of the soaking solution to

close contacts are distances <3.30 a and are listed for monomer
cl. the corresponding distances in monomer c2 are shown without
limitation on values. arg-140 is close to the surface of the protein.
the b values for the side chain of arg-140 are 45 a2 and 52 a2 in
monomers cl and c2, respectively.

the diffraction data were collected using the r-axis image
plate area detector on a rigaku (danvers, ma) rotating anode
generator operating at 5.4 kw at hengming ke's laboratory
(university of north carolina). a total of 115,147 reflections
was collected and reduced to 49,540 symmetry-independent
reflections. the data are 82.8% complete tb 2.0-a resolution
with an rmerge value of 0.0744.
the starting model for the refinement is the structure ofpig
kidney fru-1,6-pase complexed with fru-6-p, amp, and
mg2+ at 2.5-a resolution (12). the ligands fru-2,6-p2 and
amp were included in the model based on the f6-f. map
(contoured at 3a). the zinc position was identified based on
the fo-fc map (contoured at 3o-) and on criteria that include
more than three contacts within 2.5 a and reasonable angular
geometry. all solvent molecules were deleted from the model
before refinement. electron density maps were calculated
using the program suite ccp4 (18). inspection of the electron
density maps and manual intervention of the model were
carried out using the program o (19) on an evans and
sutherland (salt lake city) esv graphics station. the structure was refined using the program x-plor (20). solvent
molecules were added to the model based on the following
criteria: (i) visible density in both 2fo-fc (ho,) and f6-fc (3c)
maps and (ii) contacts <3.3 a with potential hydrogen
bonding atoms. those solvent molecules that had b values
>55 a2 after one round of refinement were deleted before the
next round of refinement. the refinement was completed at
an r value of 0.189, and the rms deviations are 0.014 a and
2.8° from ideal geometries for bond lengths and bond angles,
respectively. the 2536 protein main-chain atoms have an rms
distance of 0.36 a between the starting model and final
model. the final model contains 320 of 335 residues for each
monomer and 239 water molecules in a dimer. there are two
amp and two fru-2,6-p2 molecules and two zinc atoms in a
dimer. analysis using the program procheck (21) indicates
that the overall stereochemical quality of the structure compares favorably with other well-refined structures at 2.0-a
resolution. the ramachandran plot showed 90.2% of the
nonglycine residues in "most favored regions." an estimate
of 0.25 a for the error in coordinates was made using
luzzati's method (22). in the comparison of this structure
with other fru-1,6-pase structures, the following regions of
the amp domain (residues 9-200) and the active site domain
(residues 201-335) were excluded because of poor electron
density: residues 9-11, 54-71, 231-238, 267-272, and 331335. this comparison also includes some uncertainty because
the various structures were determined to resolution limits
that vary from 2.0 a for the present structure to limits of
2.1-3.0 a for the previously determined structures (12-17).

results and discussion
well-defined electron densities for fru-2,6-p2, amp, and
zinc ion were observed in the fo-fc difference map (contoured at 4o) before adding these ligands to the model.
reasonable b values for these ligands were found after
refinement (table 1). distances between the inhibitors amp
and fru-2,6-p2 and protein atoms are recorded in table 2-5.
the overall structure is the t-form of the enzyme. comparison of this structure with the r-form fru-6-p complex
shows a rotation between the upper dimer c1c2 and the
lower dimer c3c4 of 415°. there is no significant structural
asymmetry between monomers cl and c2. superposition of
these two monomers (ca atoms) yields rms fits of 0. 175 a and
0.199 a for the active site domain and the amp domain,
respectively (tables 2-5). the electron density and the
refined binding positions of fru-2,6-p2 and amp in monomer
cl are almost indistinguishable from those in monomer c2.
superposition of the structure of the quaternary complex
onto that of the amp complex (t form, 2.5-a resolution)
yields an rms fit of the ca atoms in the amp domain and the
active site domain of 0.394 a (0.395 a for c2) and 0.219 a
(0.208 a for c2), respectively. the position of the bound
amp is essentially the same in these two structures. the
largest displacements of amp atoms are ==0.3 a (atom n6)
and 0.7 a (atom c5') for the two sites, respectively. furtable 3. close contacts (van der waals) of amp

thermore, corresponding ca atoms of residues nearest amp
differ at most by =0.5 a for both sites in these two structures.
one region, assigned as the helix h4 (residues 123-127), was
found to be better defined in the quaternary complex than in
the amp complex based on the substantially lowered b values
(20-30 a2 vs. 40-50 a2, respectively). the interface interactions between monomers cl and c3 and between cl and c2
are essentially the same as in the amp complex except those
involving h4 residues in the c1c2 interface (see below).
superposition of the quaternary structure onto the structure of the fru-2,6-p2 complex (r form, 2.6-a resolution)
yields an rms fit of the ca atoms in the amp domain and the
active site domain of 1.215 a (1.265 a for c2) and 0.268 a
(0.267 a for c2), respectively. fru-2,6-p2 binds to the enzyme in the same manner in these two structures (fig. 1).
here again, the b values for helix h4 are found to be much
lower in the quaternary (t form) complex than in the binary
(r form) fru-2,6-p2 complex, indicative of a more ordered
region in the quaternary complex. in addition, the ca atoms
of residues 123-127 have moved between 1.0 and 2.5 a,
giving a somewhat tightened active site cavity in the t form
(fig. 1). the t and r forms showed different interactions
between the 2-phosphate oxygens of fru-2,6-p2 and ser-124
of h4; in the structure of the r-form fru-2,6-p2 complex, one
oxygen of the 2-phosphate is hydrogen-bonded to the oy of
ser-124 (distance, 2.94 a), whereas in the t-form structure,
oxygens of the 2-phosphate are in contact with the amide

nitrogens of ser-124 (distance, 2.86 a) and ser-123 (distance, 2.74 a). the oy of ser-124 is now hydrogen-bonded
to the nq1l of arg-243 from the adjacent monomer (distance,
3.15 a). another significant change is the side-chain orientation of tyr-258 from the adjacent monomer (fig. 1). in the
r-form fru-2,6-p2 complex, the phenol group of this tyr is
pointing to the surface of the protein, nearly parallel to the
axis of h4. in the quaternary complex the side chain of
tyr-258 has rotated around ca-cf3 >90° relative to the
previous orientation in the fru-2,6-p2 complex and, therefore, points toward helix h4. the o°7 group of tyr-258 is
hydrogen-bonded to the backbone carbonyl of ser-124 (0)
and amide of cys-128 (n) (distances, 2.80 a and 2.71 a,
respectively). these interactions involving tyr-258 and arg243 are not present in the monomer interface in the other
known t-form structures. in fact, the orientations of the side
chain of tyr-258 in other ligated structures resemble the
orientation in the structure of the r-form fru-2,6-p2 complex. the orientation of the side chain of tyr-258 found here
in the quatemary t-form structure is seen only in the unligated r-form structure (3.0-a resolution) in which the o°q
of tyr-258 is hydrogen-bonded to the carboxylate group of
asp-127 of the adjacent monomer (distance, 2.80 a).
only one zinc (b value, 50 a2) was found for each monomer
of the quaternary structure (fig. 2), and it is in the active site.
this zinc is penta-coordinated with three protein ligands:
082 of asp-118, 081 of asp-121, and oe2 of glu-280. the 01
oxygen of fru-2,6-p2 is also a coordination ligand (zn-o
distance, 2.52 a). finally, the fifth ligand is a water molecule,
2.47 a from zinc. the geometry of the coordination may be
described as distorted tetrahedral plus the water as an extra
ligand (the fru-2,6-p2 01-zn-water angle is =60°).
in the structure of fru-1,6-pase complexed with ahg1,6-p2 and zinc (3.0-a resolution) (16), two zinc ions (b
values, 70-80 a2) were found in the active site per monomer.
one zinc is directly bonded to a 1-phosphate oxygen from the
substrate analogue ahg-1,6-p2 and is 3.5 a from the  xxxd2809xxx -

assigned. site 1 is coordinated to the carboxylate groups of glu-97, asp-118, and glu-280 and the 1-phosphate group of substrate analogue, while
site 2 is coordinated to the carboxylate groups of glu-97 and asp-118, the 1-phosphate group of substrate analogue, and the carbonyl oxygen
of leu-120. a third metal binding site was found in this region in the absence of substrate/substrate analogue (10). site 3 (data not shown) for
metal binding involves glu-97, glu-98, and asp-118. the zinc position in the quaternary complex (site 4) is 2 a from site 1.

approximate tetrahedral geometry. the three protein ligands
are carboxylate oxygen atoms from glu-97, asp-118, and
glu-280. this site is known as the site 1 for metal binding in
the active site. the second zinc (in site 2) in the ahg-1,6-p2
complex is bound to glu-97, asp-118, leu-120, and the
1-phosphate of the substrate analogue. in the absence of
substrate or substrate analogues, zinc occurs at sites 1 and 3
(distinct from site 2). at site 3, zinc is bonded to glu-97,
glu-98, and asp-118, and, at a longer distance, to asp-74
(11).

the zinc position in fru-2,6-pr-amp-zn complex (site 4)
is different from the three metal sites described in the
preceding paragraph. it is shifted =2 a from the site 1
position in the ahg-1,6-p2-zn complex (fig. 2), probably to
accommodate the substitution of the 1-phosphate with
2-phosphate. this substitution exposes the 01 oxygen and
provides a way for asp-121 to interact with the metal. in the
absence of metal, as illustrated in the structure of the
fru-2,6-p2 complex, asp-121 interacts with the inhibitor
through hydrogen bonds between its carboxylate oxygens
and 01 and 03 from the inhibitor. in the structure of the

the zinc ion. the thin lines and the dashed lines in the background are ca traces of monomers cl and c2, respectively. the communication
between the amp site and active site in the same monomer may go through strand b3 (residues 113-118), the metal binding area (residues 97-98,
118-121, and 280), and helix h4 (residues 123-127). interactions involving arg-243 and tyr-258 provide an important pathway for signaling
between cl and c2. this pathway may be relevant to the cooperativity of metal binding and for synergism with zn-amp inhibition. in addition,
tightening of this pathway may also explain the effect in which the substrate saturation curve changes from hyperbolic to sigmoidal upon binding
of fru-2,6-p2 (4). the above mentioned communication within one monomer and across the dimer may, therefore, account for the synergistic
inhibition of fru-2,6-p2 and amp.

and the cy2 of val-249 (3.5 a). this is also the case in the
ahg-1,6-p2--zn complex.
in the presence of both zinc and the inhibitor, as in the
structure of the fru-2,6-p2-amp-zn complex, significant
changes occur around asp-121. aside from the direct interaction with zinc (2.37 a), its 082 is now hydrogen-bonded to
the amide nitrogen of val-249 (distance, 2.87 a) and its 081
is hydrogen-bonded to the 03 of the fru-2,6-p2 (distance,
2.54 a). these interactions seem to be relevant to the
"cooling down" of the h4 helix and the formation of additional interactions in the monomer interface including those
involving tyr-258 and arg-243.
the results here indicate that synergistic interaction between amp and fru-2,6-p2 may be attributed to the communication between these two inhibitors in one monomer or
over two monomers (figs. 3 and 4). it becomes clear that
strand b3 (residues 113-118) is part of the signaling pathway
between the amp domain and the active site domain. in
addition, helix h4 is an important element in this signaling
mechanism. without binding of amp to the enzyme, h4 is
still mobile and the active site cavity is in an open mode even
upon binding of fru-2,6-p2. the cooperativity of amp inhibition may be achieved through signal transmission along b3,
the metal binding area, first active site/h4, tyr-258/arg-243
from the adjacent monomer, and then to the other active site
(figs. 3 and 4). thus, h4 is important in communication
between the amp domain and the active site domain.
the presence of zinc may be critical to effective communication. the fact that metal binding primarily involves
residues from b3 provides evidence for the synergistic interactions between zinc (at high concentration) and amp. in the
current quanternary structure, zinc may contribute to the
enhanced ordering of h4 and subsequently to the contraction
of the active site cavity and to the additional interactions
between two monomers in the active site domain.
the various zinc binding sites in this and previous studies
(12-17) from this laboratory indicate that this carboxylaterich area is an ideal place for anchoring metal ions. all of the

metal ions bound to this area have high temperature factors
(>40 a) in known fru-1,6-pase structures. binding of metal
ions to different sites in this area not only determine the
function of the metal ion but also affect the flexibility or
orientation preference of h4. furthermore, binding of metal
ions to more than two specific sites or to adjacent sites may
interfere with substrate binding.
previous hypothesis for the allosteric signaling pathways of
fru-1,6-pase primarily includes monomer interfaces in the
amp domain (23). the observation of the involvement of
helix h4 in signal communication to the active site and
between monomers cl and c2 is of significance because it
provides a pathway for allosteric signaling. this pathway
probably contributes to the synergistic inhibition between
amp and fru-2,6-p2 and to the change of substrate saturation
curve from hyperbolic to sigmoidal when fru-2,6-p2 binds to
the enzyme (4, 7).
