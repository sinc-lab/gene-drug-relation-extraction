freshwater planarians are simple but useful organisms for
understanding stem cell regulatory systems and neuroregeneration. the planarian cns is composed of the brain in
the anterior part of the body, and a pair of longitudinal
ventral nerve cords (vncs) along the ventral side of the
body. the brain is composed of two lobes, and forms an
inverted u-shaped structure with nine pairs of lateral
branches (agata et al., 1998; okamoto et al., 2005). planarians possess powerful regenerative ability, which is
derived from pluripotent stem cells (agata and watanabe,
1999; agata, 2003; reddien and sánchez alvarado, 2004;
reddien et al., 2005; newmark and sánchez alvarado,
2002). the regulation of the plasticity and heterogeneity of
stem cells enables the regeneration of complete animals
from even very small fragments (sánchez alvarado, 2006;
pellettieri and sánchez alvarado, 2007; eisenhoffer et al.,
2008). especially, the stem cell regulatory system underlying planarian brain regeneration has revealed interesting
aspects, suggesting that these processes can be divided
into at least five steps (agata and umesono, 2008). the
genes that are expressed in the sequential steps underlying planarian brain regeneration are similar to those expressed during the course of mammalian brain development (cebrià et al., 2002a; nakazawa et al., 2003; inoue et
al., 2007; yazawa et al., 2009).
recently, we identified in planarians several neurotransmitters that are known to be present in vertebrates,
and determined their neural networks by immunofluorescence analysis using specific antibodies (nishimura et al.,
2007a,b, 2008a,b). several neuroreceptor genes were
also identified, and ligand identification and expression
analysis were carried out (saitoh et al., 1996; nishimura et
al., 2009). accordingly, it is now possible to begin to analyze neural functions from both the presynaptic and
postsynaptic points of view. moreover, since planarians
show specific behavioral patterns in response to treatment
with pharmacological drugs, some analytical methods
have been established to simply but quantitatively evaluate
such behavioral changes (kitamura et al., 2003; raffa and
desai, 2005; pagán et al., 2008). in addition, computerbased analytical methods have also begun to be established, allowing us to conduct behavioral analyses with
high resolution (inoue et al., 2004; hicks et al., 2006).
based on these advances, planarians have provided many
unique insights into neuroscience (nishimura et al., 2008c;
cebrià, 2007, 2008).

abstract—recent studies of the freshwater planarian dugesia
japonica have revealed fundamental mechanisms and unique
aspects of neuroscience and neuroregeneration. here, we
identified the gene for planarian  xxxg440xxx 
(djchat), which is essential for acetylcholine (ach) biosynthesis. immunofluorescence studies using anti-dugesia japonica chat (djchat) antibody revealed that cholinergic
neurons are widely distributed in the planarian nervous system, including the brain, ventral nerve cords, optic nerves,
and pharyngeal nerve plexus. in order to investigate the function of cholinergic neurons in planarians, we used both pharmacological and rna interference (rnai) approaches. administration of physostigmine (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) clearly elevated the amount of ach, and then induced
sudden muscle contraction behavior in a concentration-dependent manner. in addition, we found that pretreatment with
 xxxd3456xxx  (a muscle nicotinic ach receptor antagonist) or
atropine (a non-selective muscarinic ach receptor antagonist), but not pretreatment with  xxxd2550xxx  (a neural nicotinic ach receptor antagonist), significantly extended the
latency time for physostigmine-induced contraction behavior, suggesting that muscle nicotinic ach receptors and muscarinic ach receptors contribute to physostigmine-induced
contraction behavior. we also confirmed that ach biosynthesis ability and djchat-immunoreactivity were eliminated in
djchat(rnai) planarians. moreover, the decrease of the level
of ach induced by djchat(rnai) caused extension of the
latency time for contraction behavior. our findings support
the possibility that the cholinergic functions of planarians are
similar to those of vertebrates, suggesting that planarians are
simple but useful model organisms for getting insight into
the cholinergic nervous system in higher animals. © 2010

acetylcholine (ach) acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter in various organisms. ach is synthesized by choline
acetyltransferase (chat; ec2.3.1.6) from choline in cholinergic nerve terminals (fig. 1a) (oda, 1999). ach is then
hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase (ache;  xxxg38xxx )
after being released into the synaptic cleft, and then taken

19

up by cholinergic nerve terminals by a high-affinity choline
transporter, and used to resynthesize ach by chat
(haga, 1971; misawa et al., 2001). previous reports indicated that cholinergic drugs induce specific behavioral
changes in planarians (carolei et al., 1975; buttarelli et al.,
2000; pagán et al., 2009). in addition, it has been reported

that ach regulates muscle movement in various organisms (kato and murashima, 1985; van mier et al., 1989;
dittman and kaplan, 2008). in this study, we revealed the
anatomy of cholinergic neurons in planarians by immunofluorescence using a specific antibody against dugesia
japonica chat (djchat). in addition, we carried out rna
interference (rnai) and pharmacological approaches to
gain an understanding of the control of behavioral locomotion by cholinergic neurons.

experimental procedures
organisms
a clonal stain (ssp) of planarian (dugesia japonica) was used in
all experiments. planarians were cultured in autoclaved tap water
at 24 °c, and starved for at least 1 week before experiments.
planarians 5–7 mm in length were used for all experiments. all
animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the national institutes of health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. every effort was made to minimize the number of
animals used and their suffering.

cloning and 5= rapid amplification cdna ends
(5= race)
clone dj ah_012_a24 encoding a chat homolog was isolated
from a planarian head expressed sequence tag (est) database
(mineta et al., 2003). the clone was sequenced on both strands
using a big-dye termination kit (perkin elmer, waltham, ma,
usa), and electrophoresis using an abi 3130xl sequencer. in
order to determine the 5=-end of the sequence, we carried out 5=
race using a smart race cdna amplification kit (clontech,
palo, alto, ca, usa). gene-specific primers (gsps) were designed on the basis of the est sequence as follows: gsp r1
5=-gctgccgaggaaataccattcccgg-3=, gsp r2 5=-ccagccataaatcggcaaccc-3=. the polymerase chain reaction
(pcr) cycling consisted of an initial denaturation at 94 °c for 10
min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °c for 30 s, 60 °c for 30 s, 72 °c
for 1 min, and a final elongation step at 72 °c for 10 min. subsequently, nested pcr was carried out using gsp r2. finally, a
2466-bp cdna fragment was obtained.

phylogenetic analysis
a phylogenetic tree was created from the distance matrix with the
program treeview ppc (ver. 1.6.6) by the neighbor-joining
method (saitou and nei, 1987) using the dna data bank of japan
(ddbj) web site (http://clustalw.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-j.html). carnitine
acyltransferase ( xxxg513xxx ;  xxxg513xxx ) was used as the outgroup. the
phylogenetic distance between each protein sequence was calculated by using the kimura protein distance method. the calculations were conducted using the full-length sequences of chat
and  xxxg513xxx  using the clustalw (ver. 1.83) program (dna data bank
of japan, mishima, shizuoka, japan).

whole-mount in situ hybridization
the plasmid pbluescript sk(⫺) containing a full-length djchat
cdna including the 5=- and 3=-untranslated regions (accession
no. ab536929) was linearized with bamhi or noti, respectively.
digoxigenin (dig)-labeled antisense and sense rna probes were
synthesized using t7 and t3 rna polymerase, respectively. planarians were treated with 2% hcl in five of eight holtfreter’s
solution (37 mm nacl, 4 mm kcl, 0.5 mm cacl2, 1.5 mm
nahco3) for 5 min at 4 °c, and then were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (pfa) containing 5% methanol for 3 h at 4 °c. after

bleaching with 5% h2o2 in methanol for 16 h at room temperature
(rt) under fluorescent light, they were rehydrated through a
graded series (75–50 –25%) of ethanol solutions to 100 mm phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% triton x-100 (pbst). hybridization was carried out for 36 h at 55 °c in hybridization
solution (50% formamide, 5⫻ standard saline citrate, 0.1%
tween-20, 0.1 mg/ml heparin, 0.1 mg/ml yeast transfer rna, 10
mm dithiothreitol, 10%  xxxd1860xxx ) with dig-labeled rna
probe. sense probe was used for a negative control. non-specific
binding was blocked by 1% blocking reagent (roche diagnostics,
basel, switzerland) for 1 h at rt. they were incubated with
alkaline phosphatase (ap)-conjugated sheep anti-dig antibody
(fab fragment) (diluted 1:2000; roche diagnostics) in pbst for
3 h at rt. the staining was visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3indolyl-phosphate/4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (bcip/nbt)
(roche diagnostics) in tmn solution (100 mm tris–hcl, 50 mm
mgcl2, 100 mm nacl, ph 9.5). samples were photographed using
dp controller (ver. 2.1) (olympus, tokyo, japan) using a highresolution ccd digital camera dp70 with a 10⫻ objective (olympus). additional processing of images for contrast, color balance
and brightness was done as needed with adobe photoshop cs
(adobe systems incorporated, usa).

preparation of a mouse monoclonal anti-djchat
antibody
a mouse monoclonal anti-djchat antibody was generated essentially as previously described (nishimura et al., 2008a). a fragment
encoding amino acid residues 31–125 of djchat was inserted
into pqe30 (qiagen, chatsworth, ca, usa), and then a fusion
protein of djchat was produced in e. coli xl10-gold strain (stratagene, la jolla, ca, usa). antibody generation was carried out
by kohjin-bio (saitama, japan).

immunofluorescence
whole-mount immunofluorescence was carried out essentially as
previously described (nishimura et al., 2007a). for preparation of
the sections, animals were treated with 2% hcl in 5/8 holtfreter’s
solution for 5 min at 4 °c and then were fixed in 4% pfa containing 5% methanol for 3 h at 4 °c. they were embedded in paraffin
and then sectioned  xxxd1891xxx -␮m thickness. the primary antibodies
were as follows: a mouse monoclonal anti-djchat antibody, a
rabbit polyclonal anti-djarrestin antibody (optic nerves, sakai et
al., 2000), and a rabbit polyclonal anti-dj myosin heavy chain
(mhc)-b antibody (body-wall muscle fibers, a generous gift from
dr. hidefumi orii, orii et al., 2002). cell nuclei were stained with
hoechst 33342 (1 ␮g/ml; sigma, st. louis, mo, usa) for 30 min.
fluorescence detection was performed with a laser scanning confocal microscope fv10i (olympus) or a bx62 microscope with
dsu system (olympus) with a 20⫻ or 60⫻ objective. for the
fv10i microscopy, alexa488 and alexa594 were excited with 499
or 590 nm light, respectively, and were imaged with band pass
emission filters that transmitted light of 520 nm (alexa488) or 618
nm (alexa594). for the bx62 microscopy with dsu, alexa488,
alexa594, and hoechst33342 were detected using fluorescence
miler units of u-nuba, u-mwig2, or u-mnua, respectively. additional processing of images for contrast, color balance, and
brightness was done as needed with adobe photoshop cs, fv10asw (ver. 2.0) (olympus), and metamorph software (ver. 6.3r6)
(molecular devices corporation, downingtown, pa, usa).

western blotting
ten intact planarians were dissolved in 100 ␮l of sample buffer
[125 mm tris–hcl, 2 mg/ml bromophenol blue, 40 mg/ml  xxxd3215xxx  (sds), 20% glycerol, 4%  xxxd26xxx ,
ph 6.8] by pipetting, and were boiled for 10 min. five microliters of
sample solution was analyzed by sds-polyacrylamide gel elec-

k. nishimura et al. / neuroscience 168 (2010) 18 –30
trophoresis (sds-page), and then transferred to a polyvinylidene
difluoride (pvdf) membrane (immobilon-p, millipore, bedford,
ma, usa). the pvdf membrane was incubated with tris– buffered saline (ph 8.0) containing 0.05% tween-20 and 5% dehydrated skim milk (difco laboratories, detroit, mi, usa) for blocking non-specific protein binding. the membrane was incubated
with either a mouse monoclonal djchat antibody or a rabbit
polyclonal anti-djarrestin antibody (diluted 1:2500). then, apconjugated antibodies (diluted 1:1000) were incubated for 60 min.
bound ap-labeled antibodies were detected using a mixture of
bcip/nbt.

statistical analysis
results are given as mean⫾standard error of the mean (sem).
the significance of differences was determined by student t-test
for single comparisons, and by one-way analysis of variance
(anova) for multiple comparisons. further statistical analysis for
post hoc comparisons was performed using the bonferroni/dunn
test (statview, abacus concept, berkeley, ca, usa).

results
cloning of djchat cdna from planarian head est
library

atropine [a non-selective muscarinic ach receptor (machr) antagonist, 10 ␮m],  xxxd2550xxx  hydrochloride [a neural nicotinic
ach receptor (nachr) antagonist, 10 ␮m], physostigmine (an
ache inhibitor, 3 ␮m—10 mm), and (⫹)- xxxd3456xxx  chloride
hydrate (a muscle nachr antagonist, 100 ␮m) were purchased
from sigma.

we found a single clone (dj_ah_012_a24) that showed
strong similarity to chat from other organisms in a planarian head est database (mineta et al., 2003). because
clone dj_ah_012_a24 did not encode an initial methionine,
we carried out 5= race (see experimental procedures),
and thereby obtained a full-length cdna of 2466 bp that
encoded a predicted amino acid sequence of 682 residues
(fig. 1b). the his353 residue that is important for catalysis
(carbini and hersh, 1993) was conserved in a predicted
amino acid sequence (fig. 1b). we therefore named this
gene djchat (dugesia japonica  xxxg440xxx ).
in addition, molecular phylogenetic analysis based on
chat and  xxxg513xxx  showed that djchat was classified in the
family of chat (fig. 2). the full-length sequence of djchat
cdna has been deposited to ddbj/embl/genbank under
accession number ab536929.

behavioral assays

expression of djchat mrna and protein

solutions of the pharmacological drugs were prepared in autoclaved tap water. behavioral assays were carried out at room
temperature (22–24 °c) in autoclaved tap water or drug solutions.
after treatment of the planarians with a pharmacological drug,
behavioral changes were observed under a microscope. a 35-mm
plastic petri dish was used for behavioral observation. the volume
of the solution was 2 ml/dish. the animals were continuously
observed for the first 120 min. ten individuals were used for each
experimental group. physostigmine-induced contraction behavior
was evaluated by measuring the latency time for contraction behavior after physostigmine treatment.

the expression of djchat mrna in intact planarians was
examined by whole-mount in situ hybridization using diglabeled djchat antisense rna probe. djchat-expressing
cells were widely distributed in the planarian cns, including the brain, the vncs, and the distal portion of the
pharynx (fig. 3b), similarly to the distributions of djsytexpressing cells (a planarian synaptotagmin homolog
gene, which is used as a pan-neural marker of the planarian cns, tazaki et al., 1999) (fig. 3a). however, fluorescent activated cell sorting based single-cell gene profiling
(hayashi et al., 2010) revealed that the number of djchatexpressing cells was clearly lower than that of djsyt-expressing cells (tarui et al., unpublished observations). in
contrast, no signal was detected using djchat sense rna
probe (fig. 3c). in addition, the axonal projection and
neural morphology of djchat-immunopositive neurons
were examined by immunofluorescence using a mouse
monoclonal anti-djchat antibody, revealing that djchatimmunopositive neurons were also widely distributed in the
planarian cns (fig. 3d–h). in the head region, the two
lobes of the brain were connected by djchat-immunopositive neurons in the anterior region of the brain (fig. 3e),
and connected by several djchat-immunopositive transverse commissure neurons (fig. 3e, arrowheads). moreover, djchat-immunopositive neural fibers elongated to
lateral side of the head along the lateral branches (fig. 3e,
arrows). in the trunk region, djchat-immunopositive neurons were observed along the vncs (fig. 3f). djchatimmunopositive transverse commissure projections of the

double-stranded (ds) rna was synthesized essentially as previously described (sánchez alvarado and newmark, 1999). intact
planarians were injected with approximately 100 nl of dsrna
solution (2 ␮g/␮l) on each of three consecutive days using a
drummond scientific nanoject injector (broomall, pa, usa). vehicle-control animals were injected with autoclaved tap water.
planarians were amputated immediately posterior to the pharynx
1 day after the last injection (day 0), and 10-day regenerants from
these tail-fragments were used in the subsequent experiments.

pharmacological drugs

hplc analysis of ach and choline
three planarians were homogenized by sonication in 0.1 m perchloric acid containing 0.1 m edta and ethylhomocholine (ehc;
eicom corporation, kyoto, japan) (as an internal standard). after
centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °c, samples were
adjusted to approximately ph 5.0 using 0.2 m khco3. the supernatant was filtered through ultrafree-mc centrifugal filter (a 0.22
␮m filter, millipore, bedford, ma, usa), and 10 ␮l of the filtrate
was injected onto an ac-gel column (2.0⫻150 mm2; eicom
corp.), and chemical compounds were detected using an electrochemical detector (htec-500; eicom corp.). the working electrode potential was maintained at ⫹450 mv against ag/agcl. a
pc-03 column (3.0⫻4.0 mm2; eicom corp.) was placed between
the injector and the analytical column. an ac-enzympak column
(3.0⫻4.0 mm2; eicom corp.) was placed between the analytical
column and the electrochemical detector. the temperature was
kept constant at 33 °c. the mobile phase (400 mg/l sds, 50 mm
khco3, 50 mg/l edta) was delivered at a 150 ␮l/min flow rate.
the retention times of choline, ehc, and ach were approximately
8.4 min, 10.1 min, and 14.6 min, respectively.

fig. 2. phylogenetic tree of  xxxg440xxx  (chat). the numbers are the bootstrap values. carnitine acyltransferase ( xxxg513xxx ) was used as
the outgroup. the accession numbers for the chat and  xxxg513xxx  sequences were as follows: c. elegans chat (aaaa53660), c. elegans  xxxg513xxx 
(np_510624), d. melanogaster chat (aaa28406), s. purpuratus chat (xp_780154), s. purpuratus  xxxg513xxx  (xp_001202100), c. intestinalis chat
(np_001027621), c. intestinalis  xxxg513xxx  (xp_002131231), d. rerio chat (np_00112491), d. rerio  xxxg513xxx  (np_001005587), g. gallus chat (xp_989941),
g. gallus  xxxg513xxx  (xp_415478), m. musculus chat (np_034021), m. musculus  xxxg513xxx  (np_031786), h. sapiens chat (np_066265), and h. sapiens
 xxxg513xxx  (caa55359).

vncs connected the two nerve cords (fig. 3f, arrowheads). in addition, a pair of djchat-immunopositive axonal projections was observed flanking the midline in the
dorsal side of the whole body (fig. 3e=, f=, arrowheads). in
addition, djchat-immunopositive axons formed a net-like
structure in the dorsal side of the head (fig. 3e=). djchatimmunopositive neurons formed a nerve plexus structure
at the distal portion of the pharynx (fig. 3g). planarians
have a pair of eyes on the dorsal side of the head. the
eyes consist of at least two distinct types of cells (i.e., optic
nerve and pigment cells) (sakai et al., 2000; nishimura et
al., 2007b). djchat-immunoreactivity was also detected in
the cell bodies and rhabdomeres in the optic nerves that
were counter-stained with anti-djarrestin antibody (nishimura et al., 2007b; takeda et al., 2009) (fig. 3h, arrowheads). immunoblotting analysis using the planarian total
protein extracts showed that single stained bands corresponding to the predicted 78.2 and 44.5-kda proteins were
detected by antibodies against djchat and djarrestin,
respectively (suppl. fig. 1).
during head regeneration from tail fragments, djchatimmunoreactivity was not detected in the regenerating
anterior region of the fragments on 1 day after decapitation
(fig. 3i). on 3 day after decapitation, the newly regenerated djchat-immunopositive neurons were detected in
the future brain region (fig. 3j). on 5 day after decapitation, transverse commissure axonal projections were observed in the head (fig. 3k). on 7 day after decapitation,
djchat-immunopositive neurons were completely regenerated, and reconstructed into the same structure as in the
intact planarian head (fig. 3l). this regeneration process
was similar to that of other neurotransmitter-synthesizing
neurons [i.e., dopaminergic, ␥- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba)-

ergic and octopaminergic neurons] (nishimura et al.,
2007a, 2008a,b; takeda et al., 2009).
subsequently, we measured the amounts of ach and
choline in the whole body and amputated fragments (i.e.,
the head, trunk, and tail) using hplc (fig. 4). the amounts
of ach and choline in the whole bodies of intact animals
were 2.3⫾0.1 and 5.4⫾0.4 pmol/mg-wet weight, respectively, and the amount of ach in the head, trunk, and tail
fragments was 3.0⫾0.1, 1.0⫾0.1, and 0.6⫾0.3 pmol/mg,
respectively (fig. 4a). moreover, the amounts of choline in
the head, trunk, and tail fragments were 6.9⫾0.2, 2.9⫾0.1,
and 1.7⫾0.1 pmol/mg, respectively (fig. 4b). the amounts
of ach and choline in the head region were higher than
those in the trunk and tail regions (fig. 4a, b). the distribution of ach was similar to that of cholinergic neurons
(figs. 3b, d and 4a).
relationship between ach and physostigmineinduced contraction behavior
intact planarians performed contraction behavior within
several minutes after treatment with physostigmine, an
ache inhibitor (3 ␮m—10 mm). this behavior was characterized by constitutive contraction on the ventral side
(fig. 5a, b). after the removal of physostigmine, planarians recovered from the contraction behavior, returning to
normal behavior within several hours (data not shown). in
order to investigate the relationship between physostigmine-induced contraction behavior and the amount of
ach, we measured the amount of ach in physostigminetreated animals. the amount of ach in physostigminetreated animals (13.1⫾0.6 pmol/mg) was significantly increased compared to that in intact animals (2.5⫾0.3 pmol/

mg) (fig. 5c). conversely, the amount of choline in
physostigmine-treated animals (1.8⫾0.2 pmol/mg) was
significantly decreased compared to that in control animals
(5.4⫾0.4 pmol/mg) (fig. 5d).
previously, two mhc genes (djmhc-a and djmhc-b)
were identified, and their distributions were visualized using antibodies against djmhc-a and djmhc-b in planarians (orii et al., 2002). anti-djmhc-a and anti-djmhc-b
antibodies visualized distinct types of muscle fibers in planarians. djmhc-a-immunoreactivity was mainly detected
at the pharyngeal musculature. in contrast, djmhc-b-immunoreactivity was mainly detected at the body-wall musculature. djmhc-b-immunopositive musculature could be
further classified into at least three layers that were composed of circular fibers, meshwork fibers, and longitudinal
fibers in the outer, middle, and inner layers, respectively
(orii et al., 2002). we focused on the morphological
changes of body-wall musculature that could be seen by
staining with anti-djmhc-b antibody in physostigminetreated planarians. compared to the musculature of intact
planarians (fig. 5e), the intervals between individual circular fibers were significantly shortened by physostigmine
treatment (fig. 5f, g). in contrast, the intervals between
individual longitudinal fibers were significantly expanded
by physostigmine treatment (fig. 5e=, f=, g). in addition,
the individual circular fibers became significantly thinner
after physostigmine treatment (fig. 5e, f, h). in contrast,
the individual longitudinal fibers slightly became thicker
after physostigmine treatment (fig. 5e=, f=, h). these
results supported the idea that the physostigmine-induced
contraction behavior was caused by body-wall muscle contraction. these results suggest that the concentration of
ach was increased by physostigmine treatment, and then
the high concentration of ach induced muscle contraction
behavior. in order to evaluate the physostigmine-induced
contraction behavior, we measured the latency time until
the contraction behavior after physostigmine treatment.
we found that the latency time of the contraction behavior
was dependent on the concentration of physostigmine
(fig. 5i). a rapid concentration response was observed
after treatment with 30 ␮m—10 mm physostigmine, while

concentration-dependent latency times for contraction behavior were observed upon treatment with 3–10 ␮m physostigmine. therefore, we used 10 ␮m physostigmine in
further experiments.
contribution of ach receptors to
physostigmine-induced contraction behavior
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs) and muscarinic
acetylcholine receptors (machrs) are widely present in
various animal species (lukas et al., 1999; li et al., 2007).
nachrs are ligand-gated channel type receptors (ionotropic receptors), whereas machrs are members of gprotein-coupled receptors. in the case of vertebrates, 15
subunits of nachrs have been identified. ␣1, ␤1, ␥, ␦, and
␧ subunits are associated with muscle nachrs. other
subtypes (i.e., ␣2-10 and ␤2– 4) are associated with neural
nachrs (le novère et al., 2002). five types of machrs
(m1–5) have been identified in vertebrates, and shown to
play important roles in regulating the central and peripheral
nervous systems, including parasympathetic neurons (bymaster et al., 2003). in order to investigate which type(s) of
ach receptor contribute(s) to the physostigmine-induced
contraction behavior, we used several ach receptor antagonists such as atropine (a non-selective machr antagonist, 10 ␮m),  xxxd2550xxx  (a neural nachr antagonist,
10 ␮m), and  xxxd3456xxx  (a muscle nachr antagonist,
100 ␮m). we found that when planarians were pretreated
with various antagonists for 2 h before physostigmine
treatment, the latency time for contraction behavior was
not affected by pretreatment with  xxxd2550xxx  (fig. 5j),
while the latency time was significantly extended by pretreatment with either  xxxd3456xxx  or atropine (fig. 5j).
these results suggest that muscle nachrs and machrs
mediate the physostigmine-induced contraction behavior
in planarians.

narians, we carried out double-immunofluorescence using
antibodies against djchat and djmhc-b (fig. 6). djchat-immunopositive neurons were distributed close to
djmhc-b-immunopositive muscle fibers on the body-wall
(fig. 6a). the axons of djchat-immunopositive neurons
were elongated along the djmhc-b-immunopositive muscle fibers at the ventral surface of the body (fig. 6a). in the
magnified view, the axons of djchat-immunopositive neurons seem to be attached to the djmhc-b-immunopositive
muscle fibers (fig. 6a=). djchat-immunopositive neurons
were located at neighboring positions of djmhc-b-immunopositive muscle fibers in the ventral side of the body

(fig. 6b, c, arrowheads). these observations suggest that
djchat-immunopositive neurons on the vncs seem to be
partially attached to djmhc-b-immunopositive muscle fibers on the body-wall in the ventral side of the body.

tigate the effect of djchat(rnai) on ach biosynthesis, we
measured the amount of ach in regenerants from tailfragments (fig. 7c). the amount of ach in regenerants of
djchat(rnai) planarians was significantly decreased compared with that in vehicle-control animals. these results
strongly supported the idea that djchat is essential for
ach biosynthesis in planarians.
next, we examined the physostigmine-induced contraction behavior in djchat(rnai) planarians. when vehicle-control animals were treated with physostigmine, they
performed contraction behavior at 784.4⫾25.0 s after physostigmine treatment. the latency time for contraction behavior (983.1⫾47.4 s) in djchat(rnai) animals was significantly extended compared to that of vehicle-control animals (784.4⫾25.0 s) (fig. 7d). these results indicated that
the low level of ach induced by djchat(rnai) caused
extension of the latency time for contraction behavior.

discussion
djchat is essential for ach biosynthesis in
planarians
we first identified the cdna for a planarian chat, the gene
that encodes the rate-limiting enzyme for ach biosynthesis
in both vertebrates and invertebrates (figs. 1 and 2).
djchat-knockdown experiments revealed that the amount
of ach in djchat(rnai) planarians was significantly decreased compared to that in vehicle-control animals (fig.
7c). additionally, djchat-immunoreactivity was also eliminated in djchat(rnai) planarians (fig. 7a, b). taken together, these findings indicate that djchat is functionally
required for ach biosynthesis in planarians.

planarian regenerants from tail-fragments (fig. 7a, b).
immunofluorescence analysis revealed that djchat-immunoreactivity was detected in vehicle-control (water) planarians (fig. 7a), whereas djchat-immunoreactivity was
eliminated in the newly regenerated region of djchat(rnai)
planarians (fig. 7b), while immunoreactivity of djchat
was still slightly detected in the pre-existing region of
djchat(rnai) planarians (fig. 7b, arrowheads) (takano et
al., 2007).
chat is the rate-limiting enzyme for ach biosynthesis
in various animals (oda, 1999) (fig. 1a). in order to inves-

localization of the planarian cholinergic neurons
in this study, we revealed the precise distribution patterns
of the planarian cholinergic neurons using a mouse monoclonal anti-djchat antibody (fig. 3d–h). djchat-immunopositive neurons were widely distributed in the planarian
nervous system (i.e., the brain, the vncs, the optic nerves,
and the pharyngeal nerve plexus). in addition, our hplc
analyses revealed that the amount of ach in the head
region was higher than that in the trunk and tail regions
(fig. 4a). the distribution of ach was similar to the localization of djchat-immunopositive neurons (figs. 3d and
4a). these results confirmed that our anti-djchat antibody is useful for detecting the planarian cholinergic nervous system.
process of regeneration of cholinergic neurons in
planarians
the process of head regeneration in planarians can be
classified into at least five steps. therefore, determining
the stage when a gene begins to be expressed is useful for
delimiting the gene-function (agata and umesono, 2008).
in order to predict the function of djchat, we examined
when cholinergic neurons began to appear in the future
brain region after decapitation, and found that djchatimmunopositive neurons began to appear in the future

28

k. nishimura et al. / neuroscience 168 (2010) 18 –30

brain region from 3 days after decapitation (fig. 3j). thereafter, the number of somata of djchat-immunopositive
neurons increased, and djchat-immunopositive axons
formed complicated neural networks at 3–7 days (fig. 3k).
djchat-immunopositive neurons and the head structures
were almost completely regenerated 7 days after decapitation (fig. 3l). based on previous reports, 3 days after
decapitation is known as the neural network formation
stage, and days 5–7 after decapitation are known as the
neural functional recovery stage (inoue et al., 2004; agata
and umesono, 2008). we previously showed that dopaminergic, gabaergic, and octopaminergic neurons appeared
at the future brain region 3 days after decapitation, and
then were organized into reconstructed structures 3–7
days after decapitation (nishimura et al., 2007a, 2008a,b;
takeda et al., 2009). finally, dopaminergic and gabaergic
neurons were shown to contribute to the neural functions
of locomotion activity and photorecognition, respectively
(nishimura et al., 2007a, 2008a). the process of regeneration of djchat-immunopositive neurons seems to be
similar to that of these other neurons, suggesting that
djchat-immunopositive neurons play important roles in
neural network formation and neural functions.
cholinergic neurons regulate muscle contraction in
planarians
in the past, several reports demonstrated that planarians
performed contraction behavior upon treatment with physostigmine, an ache inhibitor (carolei et al., 1975; buttarelli et al., 2000). in this study, we revealed more details
of the responsible molecular and signal pathways using
methods combining rnai and pharmacological approaches. we found that the amount of ach in physostigmine-treated planarians was significantly elevated compared to that in the physiological state (fig. 5c). a high
amount of ach rapidly induced muscle contraction behavior in a concentration-dependent manner (fig. 5e–h).
conversely, djchat-knockdown experiments revealed that
a low amount of ach caused extension of the latency time
for contraction behavior compared to that of intact animals
(fig. 7d). accordingly, the measurement of the latency
time for contraction behavior is a suitable method for evaluating the cholinergic function in muscle contraction. by
using this method, we found that the latency time for
physostigmine-induced contraction behavior was also significantly extended by pretreatment with either  xxxd3456xxx  or atropine, but not pretreatment with  xxxd2550xxx 
(fig. 5j). these results suggest that muscle nachrs and
machrs may be mainly involved in muscle contraction
behavior. our est database contained putative nachr
and machr homologous genes (cebrià et al., 2002b;
mineta et al., 2003). however, the functional identification
of these receptors is still under investigation (tarui et al.,
unpublished observations). our immunofluorescence analysis using antibodies against djchat and djmhc-b revealed that djchat-immunopositive neurons and djmhcb-immunopositive muscle fibers were closely associated
with each other at the ventral surface, suggesting that
cholinergic neurons on the vncs might be functionally

connected to musculature on the body-wall (fig. 6). collectively, these data support the notion that cholinergic
neurons contribute to motor function in planarians. in
higher animals, cholinergic transmission is important for
muscle contraction. especially, nicotinic and muscarinic
transmissions regulate the skeletal muscle and smooth
muscle, respectively (matsui et al., 2002; ogier et al.,
2008). unfortunately, we could not distinguish between the
behavioral changes mediated by nicotinic and muscarinic
cholinergic transmissions of planarians in this study.
we demonstrated previously that methamphetamine (a dopamine releaser) induced screw-like hyperkinesia and c-like hyperkinesia in intact planarians. moreover, these hyperkinetic behaviors were suppressed in
djth(rnai) animals, indicating that dopaminergic neurons
also contribute to motor activity in planarians (nishimura
et al., 2007a). in addition, 5-ht and neuropeptides (i.e.,
fmrfamide, gnffrfamide, gyirfamide, ryirfamide
and yirfamide) also contribute to muscle contraction in
other platyhelminthes species such as schistosoma mansoni and procerodes littoralis (day et al., 1996; moneypenny et al., 2001). recently, cebrià demonstrated that
5-ht-immunopositive neurons elongated along longitudinal muscle fibers in schmidtea mediterranea (cebrià,
2008). investigating the relationship between ach and
these neurotransmitters in motor function will be important
in future studies.
in this study, we found that djchat-immunopositive
neurons formed a nerve plexus structure at the distal portion of the pharynx (fig. 3g). we examined the feeding
behavior of the pharynx in djchat(rnai) planarians, and
observed that djchat(rnai) animals took feed normally by
extending the pharynx and opening the distal portion of the
pharynx. the feeding behavior in djchat(rnai) planarians
thus seems likely to be the same as that in intact animals
(data not shown), implying that cholinergic neurons may
not contribute to the regulation of feeding behavior in planarians.

conclusion
in conclusion, we identified a planarian chat (djchat)
cdna, and generated a specific antibody against djchat
protein. staining with anti-djchat antibody provides a
useful marker for cholinergic neurons, and can strongly
contribute to the analysis of the distributions and functions
of cholinergic neurons in dugesia japonica. combined
rnai approaches and pharmacological approaches revealed that cholinergic neurons contribute to muscle contraction mediated by muscle nachrs and machrs in
planarians. these findings support the idea that planarians
are simple but useful model organisms for further investigating the cholinergic nervous system, which is not easily
studied in either lower or higher animals. additionally, they
will also be useful for investigating the evolution of the
cholinergic system in the animal kingdom.
