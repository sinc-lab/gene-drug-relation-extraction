adjuvant therapies for patients with early-stage breast cancer
(6,7). results to date indicate that aromatase inhibitors are
more effective and better tolerated than tamoxifen. adjuvant
tamoxifen has proved to be a remarkably successful breast
cancer therapy (8,9). tamoxifen blocks the action of estrogen
at the receptor level, whereas aromatase inhibitors block the
synthesis of estrogen in non-ovarian tissues, including breast
tissue of postmenopausal patients. consequently, there is
considerable interest in determining the best strategy for
using these agents to extend the time to disease progression
and to increase patient survival rates. although several trials
are underway [reviewed in (7)], the clinical effects of combining and/or alternating aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen
have not been determined.
as a guide for optimizing treatment of postmenopausal
breast cancer patients, we developed a postmenopausal breast
cancer model that is sensitive to both antiestrogens and aromatase inhibitors (10,11). in this model, hormone-responsive
mcf-7 human breast cancer cells stably transfected with the
human aromatase gene (mcf-7ca) (12) are grown as tumors
and serve as an autocrine source of estrogen in ovariectomized, immune-suppressed mice (10,11). in this regard, the
model simulates the postmenopausal breast cancer patient, in
whom the major source of the hormone is non-ovarian tissue,
including normal and malignant breast tissue (13,14), and
hormone production is not under gonadotropin regulation.
because the uterus is very sensitive to estrogen, change in
uterine weight in these mice serves as a bioassay of endogenous estrogen levels. because the production of adrenal
androgens is deficient in these mice (15), we supplement them
with ⌬ xxxd176xxx . we have shown previously that
⌬ xxxd176xxx  has no direct effect on tumor growth
(10). the aims of the study were to determine whether tumor
progression in this model could be delayed by combining
and/or alternating letrozole and tamoxifen therapies and
whether tumors progressing on one type of therapy remained
sensitive to second-line treatment with the other class of
agent.

background: the antiestrogen tamoxifen has potent activity against  xxxg730xxx –positive breast cancer, but
two nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors, letrozole and anastrozole, show considerable advantages over tamoxifen
with respect to patient survival and tolerability. to determine the optimal way to use letrozole and tamoxifen, we
studied their effects on a breast tumor xenograft model,
mcf-7ca, that is responsive to both antiestrogens and
aromatase inhibitors. methods: female ovariectomized
balb/c athymic nude mice carrying xenograft tumors
were treated daily subcutaneously with one of the following first-line therapies for varying durations: no drug
(control), tamoxifen (100 ␮g/day) alone, letrozole (10 ␮g/
day) alone, both drugs at the same time, or alternating
4-week courses of each drug (beginning with a course of
tamoxifen or beginning with a course of letrozole). tumor
volumes and weights were estimated using linear mixedeffects models. the time to tumor doubling was calculated, and tumor weights in the treatment groups were
compared, with adjustments for multiple comparisons being made with either tukey’s or dunnett’s procedure.
second-line therapies (with tamoxifen, letrozole, or  xxxd2165xxx ) were initiated when tumors doubled in size under first-line therapies. all statistical tests were two-sided.
results: the times for doubling of tumor volume were as
follows: control, 3– 4 weeks; tamoxifen alone, 16 weeks;
tamoxifen alternating with letrozole, 17–18 weeks; tamoxifen plus letrozole, 18 weeks; letrozole alternating with
tamoxifen, 22 weeks; letrozole alone, 34 weeks. first-line
treatment with letrozole was superior to treatment with
tamoxifen alone or with the two drugs combined (at week
16, both p<.001). alternating tamoxifen and letrozole and
alternating letrozole and tamoxifen were also not as effective as letrozole alone (at week 16, p ⴝ .002 and p<.001,
respectively). tumors progressing on tamoxifen remained
sensitive to second-line therapy with letrozole compared
with those remaining on tamoxifen at the end of treatment
(week 28, p<.001), whereas tumors progressing on letrozole were unaffected by second-line treatment with the
antiestrogens tamoxifen or  xxxd2165xxx . conclusions:
first-line letrozole therapy extends time for tumor progression in this model relative to the other treatment
regimens tested. however, further studies are needed to
determine the most effective second-line therapy for tumors that progress on letrozole. [j natl cancer inst 2004;

serum was obtained from hyclone (logan, ut), and matrigel
was obtained from bd biosciences (bedford, ma). ⌬4androstenedione, tamoxifen, hydroxypropyl cellulose, and tween
20 were obtained from sigma chemical company (st. louis,
mo). letrozole ( xxxd2459xxx ) was provided by dr. d. evans
(novartis pharma, basel, switzerland). the pure antiestrogen
 xxxd2165xxx  ( xxxd2165xxx ,780) was supplied by dr. a. wakeling (astrazeneca pharmaceuticals, macclesfield, u.k.).

all animal studies were performed according to the guidelines and approval of the animal care committee of the university of maryland school of medicine. female ovariectomized
balb/c athymic nude mice 4 – 6 weeks of age were obtained
from the national cancer institute-frederick cancer research
and development center (frederick, md). the mice were
housed in a pathogen-free environment under controlled conditions of light and humidity and received food and water ad libitum.
mcf-7ca tumor xenografts were grown in the mice as previously described (10,11,16,17). mcf-7ca cells were routinely
maintained in dulbecco’s modified eagle medium with 5% fetal
bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution, and 750
␮g/ml  xxxg418xxx . subconfluent cells were scraped into dulbecco’s
phosphate-buffered saline, collected by centrifugation, and
resuspended in matrigel (10 mg/ml) at 2.5 ⫻ 107 cells/ml.
each mouse received subcutaneous inoculations in two sites
per flank with 100 ␮l of cell suspension. all mice were then
injected daily with ⌬ xxxd176xxx  (100 ␮g/day) for the
duration of the experiment. tumor size was measured weekly
with calipers, and tumor volume was calculated by the formula (4/3␲ r12 ⫻ r2), where r1 is the smaller radius and r2 is
the larger radius. treatments began when the tumors reached
a measurable size (approximately 300 mm3), which was approximately 4 weeks after cell inoculation. mice were then
injected subcutaneously daily with the indicated drugs in
addition to the ⌬ xxxd176xxx  supplement. drugs were
prepared as suspensions in 0.3% hydroxypropyl cellulose.
mice were treated for the indicated times, after which they
were killed by decapitation and the trunk blood was collected.
tumors and uteri were excised, cleaned, weighed, and stored
in liquid nitrogen for additional analysis.
first-line treatments with letrozole and tamoxifen

second-line treatments with letrozole and tamoxifen
in vivo
after the tumors had doubled in volume and were unresponsive to the first-line therapy with tamoxifen, letrozole, or tamoxifen plus letrozole (at 16, 34, and 20 weeks, respectively; see
“results”), mice were divided into groups for second-line treatments, which were given for 12 weeks. mice treated with
tamoxifen as first-line therapy were divided into three groups for
continued treatment with tamoxifen or for second-line treatment
with letrozole or tamoxifen plus letrozole. mice treated with
tamoxifen plus letrozole as first-line therapy were divided into
three groups for continued treatment with tamoxifen plus letrozole or for second-line treatment with tamoxifen or letrozole.
mice treated with letrozole as first-line therapy were divided into
three groups for continued treatment with letrozole or for
second-line treatment with  xxxd2165xxx  (1 mg/day) or tamoxifen.
tumors were monitored for up to week 46. as above, the dose
of  xxxd2165xxx  (1 mg/day) used in second-line therapy was the
same as previously used and found to be optimally effective
(19).
measurement of serum letrozole and tamoxifen levels
serum letrozole levels were measured as previously described (20). briefly, letrozole was extracted from serum by
mixing it with 100%  xxxd2052xxx . after vortexing and centrifugation  xxxd1891xxx  000g for 10 minutes at 4 °c, the top layer was
removed, solvent was evaporated, and the extract was reconstituted in 1 ml of methanol. levels of letrozole were measured by
high-performance liquid chromatography using a waters fluorescence detector (waters, milford, ma) (␭ excitation ⫽ 230
nm; ␭ emission ⫽ 295 nm). letrozole was separated at a flow
rate of 1.5 ml/minute in a waters novapak 10-␮m c18 column
(3.9 mm ⫻ 15 cm) using a mobile phase of 0.01 m phosphate
buffer:acetonitrile (70:30). the calibration curve was constructed using letrozole at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to
1000 ng/ml (r2 ⫽ .99) in mouse plasma (equitech-bio, kerrville, tx).
serum tamoxifen levels were measured as previously described, with some modifications (21). briefly, tamoxifen was
extracted from serum by mixing it with 2% butanol in hexane
(vol/vol). after vortexing and centrifugation  xxxd1891xxx  000g for 10
minutes at 4 °c, the top layer was removed, air-dried, and
reconstituted in 1 ml of methanol. prior to analysis by highperformance liquid chromatography using a mobile phase of
methanol:water:triethylamine (93 : 7 :0.01), 300 ␮l of the sample was exposed to short wavelength uv light (254 nm) at a
distance of 10 cm for 1 minute in a box lined with aluminum
foil. tamoxifen was separated in a 5-␮m ods column (4.6 mm

tamoxifen (100 ␮g/day) and letrozole (10 ␮g/day) on 4-week
rotations, beginning with tamoxifen. the dose of letrozole used
had been determined to be maximally effective in reducing
tumor volume in several previous experiments (11). the dose of
tamoxifen used was chosen because, in earlier studies (18,19),
doses of tamoxifen of 60 –500 ␮g/day showed equivalent tumor
suppression. in addition, a dose of 100 ␮g/day led to optimal
tumor growth suppression in previous mouse studies (18,19).

statistical analysis

results
growth responses to first-line treatments with
letrozole and tamoxifen in vivo
mice were divided into six groups (n ⫽ 20 per group) and all
received ⌬ xxxd176xxx  supplement. there was no statistically significant difference between tumor volumes of the
groups at the start of treatment (week 0) (data not shown). the
groups were administered either no drug treatment (control),
treatment with letrozole (10 ␮g/day), treatment with tamoxifen
(100 ␮g/day), treatment with letrozole plus tamoxifen at the
same doses, treatment with letrozole alternating with tamoxifen
on a 4-week rotation, and treatment with tamoxifen alternating
with letrozole on a 4-week rotation. mcf-7ca tumors in the
control mice doubled in volume after 3– 4 weeks (table 1) and
increased about sixfold in volume in 8 weeks (fig. 1, a). the
estimated mean tumor weight at week 8 was 843.7 mg (95%
ci ⫽ 530.4 to 1157.0 mg) (fig. 2, a). the mean wet uterine
weight of the controls was 49.0 mg (95% ci ⫽ 40.5 to 57.5 mg),
much higher than the average weight of the atrophic uterus
(approximately 10 mg) of ovariectomized mice, indicating that
aromatase in the tumors was functional and producing sufficient
estrogen to stimulate uterine growth in the ovariectomized mice.
tumor growth in tamoxifen-treated mice was relatively static
compared with that in the control group for the first 8 weeks of
treatment (fig. 1, a and b). thereafter, tumors started to proliferate slowly, doubling in volume after 16 weeks of treatment
(table 1). tumor volumes were statistically significantly larger

in the tamoxifen treatment group than in the letrozole treatment
group at 28 weeks; the estimated difference in treatment effect
(between tamoxifen and letrozole) after log-transformation was
0.8 (95% ci ⫽ 0.5 to 1.1) (p⬍.001).
uterine weight was different across the six treatment groups
(p⬍.001). at week 8, the mean uterine weight in the control
group was 49.0 mg and that in the letrozole group was 13.5 mg
(difference ⫽ 35.5 mg, 95% ci ⫽ 4.8 to 66.2 mg). the results
indicate that letrozole indeed inhibited estrogen production.
tamoxifen treatment was associated with increased uterine
weight after week 4, and uterine weight in tamoxifen-treated
mice remained high for the duration of the experiment (fig. 2, a
and b). after 28 weeks, mean uterine weight in the tamoxifentreated mice was 60.0 mg (95% ci ⫽ 44.7 to 75.3 mg) (fig. 2,
a) and that in the control mice was 49.0 mg (95% ci ⫽ 45.1 to
52.9 mg). the average uterine weight in the group treated with
letrozole plus tamoxifen was consistently higher than that in
mice that received letrozole alone (fig. 2, b). for instance, at
week 12, the mean uterine weight in the letrozole plus tamoxifen
group was 100.4 mg and that in the letrozole-alone group was
18.8 mg (difference ⫽ 81.6 mg, 95% ci ⫽ 56.7 to 106.5 mg).
the finding of higher uterine weights in the letrozole plus
tamoxifen group than in the letrozole-alone group suggests that
the agonistic effect of tamoxifen on the uterus is evident when
endogenous estrogen levels are reduced by letrozole treatment.
this is consistent with the finding that serum levels of tamoxifen
had stabilized by 4 weeks of treatment and remained stable for
the duration of the experiment.
as previously reported (16,17), letrozole induced marked
regression of mcf-7ca tumors (fig. 1, a and b). in these
experiments, tumor volume was reduced by 54% over the first 4
weeks of treatment. although the tumors subsequently began to
proliferate slowly in the presence of letrozole, tumor volumes
did not return to their pretreatment level until after 18 weeks of
treatment. furthermore, they did not double in volume until after
34 weeks of treatment (table 1; fig. 1, a). letrozole treatment
was continued for 56 weeks before the experiment was terminated (fig. 2, a); at that point, tumor weights were 497.0 mg
(95% ci ⫽ 206.3 to 787.7 mg) and uterine weights were 13.5
mg (95% ci ⫽ ⫺8.1 to 35.1 mg) (fig. 2, a). the reduced
uterine weights compared with those of controls reflect the low
level of estrogen being produced by the tumors in the presence

linear mixed-effects models were fitted to estimate average
tumor weight and volume within each treatment group. each
experiment was analyzed separately. weights of multiple tumors
were obtained for each mouse after the mice were killed. the
mean effect of treatment in each group and random effects for
each mouse within a group were estimated. data on tumor
volume were longitudinal and unbalanced. the duration of treatment varied across the treatment groups. it was not possible to
measure the same number of multiple tumors per mouse at all
time points. in addition, diagnostic plots suggested that models
of exponential growth were appropriate to the tumor growth
data. therefore, linear mixed-effects models were fitted to the
natural logarithm of tumor volume over time. this approach
allows an exponential parameter controlling the rate of growth to
be estimated for each of these treatment groups, with the random
effects being estimated for each subject in a group (22).
the general linear models technique was used to analyze
the uterine weight data, which indicate endogenous estrogen
levels. the treatment groups were compared at the .05 level
of significance.
all hypothesis tests were two-sided. adjustments for multiple
comparisons were made by using either tukey’s or dunnett’s
procedure (23,24). results are presented as treatment mean
and/or difference in the treatment means with the corresponding
95% confidence intervals (cis).

95% ci ⫽ ⫺1275.8 to 3101.6 ng/ml) (table 2), indicating that
letrozole levels were sufficient to maintain estrogen suppression
throughout the experiment. levels of tamoxifen were similar in
serum from mice treated with letrozole and tamoxifen combined
and from mice treated with tamoxifen alone (table 3).
tumors in mice treated with a combination of tamoxifen plus
letrozole also regressed over the first 3 weeks of treatment (fig.
1, a) but to a lesser extent than tumors treated with letrozole
alone. after 3 weeks of treatment, tumors treated with the
combination had regressed by 23%, but after 18 weeks of
treatment, they had doubled in volume (table 1; fig. 1, a).

plus tamoxifen, estrogen production was inhibited by letrozole,
yet uterine weights were similar to the uterine weights in controls that were receiving estrogen. this result clearly demonstrates the estrogenic effect of tamoxifen on the mouse uterus.
it has been reported (27,28) that treatment of patients with
tamoxifen and letrozole combined results in a reduction of
37.6% in serum letrozole levels (p⬍.001) but does not affect
serum tamoxifen levels. in our study, mice treated with letrozole
alone for 32 weeks had a mean serum letrozole level of 868.0
ng/ml, whereas serum letrozole levels in mice treated with the
combination was 643.2 ng/ml (difference ⫽ 224.8, 95% ci ⫽
⫺412.5 to 862.2) (table 2). serum levels were not different
between these two treatment groups (p ⫽ .27). we had a
sufficient amount of serum to measure levels of tamoxifen in
only a small number of animals. these measurements, however,
indicated a reduction of only 11% in the level of tamoxifen, from
427.6 ng/ml in mice treated with tamoxifen alone to 382.4
ng/ml in mice treated with tamoxifen plus letrozole (difference
⫽ 45.2 ng/ml, 95% ci ⫽ ⫺150.6 to 241.0 ng/ml) (table 3).
the difference is not statistically significant (p ⫽ .43).
tumors in mice that were treated with letrozole for 4 weeks
and then treated with tamoxifen and letrozole alternately over
4-week intervals initially regressed during the first 4 weeks of
letrozole treatment (fig. 1, b). however, when the therapy was
switched from letrozole to tamoxifen (weeks 5– 8), the tumors
proliferated rapidly for 2 weeks before growth stabilized. when
the therapy was switched back to letrozole (weeks 9 –12), the
tumors regressed again, but for only 1 week, and then they
proliferated slowly. tamoxifen therapy throughout weeks 13–16
resulted in tumor proliferation. the pattern of response (i.e.,
initial regression followed by proliferation) was repeated for
letrozole for weeks 17–24, but during weeks 24 –28, tumors
continued to proliferate with tamoxifen treatment. after four
cycles of letrozole alternated with three cycles of tamoxifen, the
tumors had acquired the ability to proliferate in the presence of
both therapies. at the end of the experiment (i.e., at 28 weeks),
tumor volumes in mice treated with alternating letrozole and
tamoxifen were statistically significantly larger than those in
mice treated with letrozole alone (difference in log-transformed
tumor volume ⫽ 0.87, 95% ci ⫽ 0.51 to 1.23) (p⬍.001 at 16
weeks). tumor weights were determined at autopsy. after 28
weeks, the mean tumor weight in the letrozole alternating with
tamoxifen group was 280.2 mg and that in the tamoxifen alternating with letrozole group was 931.8 mg (difference ⫽ 651.6
mg, 95% ci ⫽ 143.0 to 1148.6 mg) (fig. 2, a).
a similar pattern of tumor proliferation and regression was
observed in mice that were treated first with tamoxifen for 4
weeks and then treated alternately with letrozole and tamoxifen
over 4-week intervals (fig. 1, b). tumor growth was relatively
static during the first 4 weeks of tamoxifen therapy. when
switched to letrozole (weeks 5– 8), tumors initially regressed for
2 weeks and then proliferated slowly. tamoxifen therapy (during weeks 9 –12) was associated with rapid proliferation. when
switched back to letrozole (weeks 13–16), the tumors again
regressed for 2 weeks before proliferating thereafter on either
drug. ultimately, tumors were able to proliferate in the presence
of letrozole after three cycles of tamoxifen. however, when the
first treatment in the rotation was tamoxifen, tumors doubled in
volume in 22 weeks compared with 17–18 weeks when the first
course of treatment was letrozole. at 28 weeks, tumor volumes

in mice treated with tamoxifen alternating with letrozole were
statistically significantly larger than those in mice treated with
letrozole (difference in log-transformed tumor volume ⫽ 1.29,
95% ci ⫽ 0.82 to 1.76) (p⬍.001). however, treatment with
letrozole alternating with tamoxifen was more efficient at reducing tumor volume than treatment with tamoxifen alone, with a
mean difference in log-transformed tumor volume of 0.50 (95%
ci ⫽ 0.01 to 0.90) (fig. 1, b). nevertheless, compared with
therapy with letrozole alone, neither of the alternating regimens
prolonged time to tumor progression (i.e., the time when tumors
begin to grow on treatment).

xenograft tumors progressing on tamoxifen treatment. a) tumors in the mice
treated with tamoxifen (100 ␮g/day) doubled in volume after 16 weeks of
treatment. at that point, the mice were divided into three groups for continued
treatment with tamoxifen (n ⫽ 4), for second-line treatment with letrozole (10
␮g/day) (n ⫽ 5), or for treatment with a combination of tamoxifen (100 ␮g/day)
and letrozole (n ⫽ 5). second-line treatment lasted for 12 weeks, and tumor
volumes were measured weekly for a total of 28 weeks. tumor volumes are
expressed as the percent change relative to the initial tumor volume. letrozole
was not as effective as a second-line treatment as it was as a first-line treatment;
the estimated mean difference in log-transformed tumor volumes at 28 weeks
was 1.13 (95% confidence interval ⫽ 0.66 to 1.60). b) after the 12 weeks of
second-line treatments, the mice were killed (week 28), and the tumors and uteri
were removed, cleaned, and weighed. the uterine weight was lower in the
tamoxifen to letrozole group than in the tamoxifen-alone group. the estimated
difference between treatment means was 37.6 (95% confidence interval ⫽ 26.5
to 48.7). error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.

letrozole for another 12 weeks, and the other groups received
second-line treatment with either tamoxifen or letrozole for 12
weeks (fig. 4, a). tumors of mice treated with the combination
continued to proliferate for the duration of the experiment, with
volumes increasing by an additional 3.3-fold over the 12 weeks
of continued combination treatment. tumor volumes in the mice
switched to second-line tamoxifen increased 2.8-fold over the
same 12 weeks. tumor and uterine weights in the mice switched
to tamoxifen were similar to those in the mice that remained on
the combination treatment (fig. 4, b). in contrast, tumors in

after 16 weeks, tumors in the tamoxifen-treated mice had
doubled in volume and were deemed unresponsive to therapy.
because some mice had been autopsied at earlier time points, 14
mice remained in the tamoxifen group. these mice were divided
into three groups (four mice, five mice, and five mice) with
similar (and not statistically significantly different) total tumor
volumes. the first group was treated for another 12 weeks with
tamoxifen, and the other groups were administered second-line
treatment with letrozole or a combination of tamoxifen plus
letrozole for an additional 12 weeks (fig. 3, a). the tamoxifentreated tumors continued to proliferate for the duration of the
experiment, and tumor volumes in that group increased 3.6-fold
over the next 12 weeks. tumor growth in the mice switched to
letrozole decreased during the first week, stabilized for the next
2 weeks, and then increased slowly. over the last 3 weeks of
letrozole treatment, tumors grew more rapidly and volumes
increased by 1.6-fold. therefore, letrozole was not as effective
for second-line therapy as it was for first-line treatment (mean
difference in log-transformed tumor volume at 28 weeks ⫽ 1.13,
95% ci ⫽ 0.66 to 1.60) (p⬍.001).
at the end of the experiment, i.e., at 28 weeks (fig. 3, a), the
average tumor volume in mice treated with tamoxifen was
greater than that in mice treated with tamoxifen plus letrozole as
second-line therapy, but the difference was not statistically significant. however, the differences in mean tumor weight and
tumor volume were statistically significantly different between
mice receiving second-line letrozole and mice continuing on
tamoxifen. the difference in mean tumor weight was 1061.8 mg
(95% ci ⫽ 84.1 to 2207.7 mg, p⬍.001). serum letrozole levels
in the second-line treatment group were similar to those in mice
that received letrozole as first-line treatment (table 2), suggesting that estrogen production was equally inhibited with first- and
second-line letrozole treatment. reduced mean uterine weights
in the group treated with letrozole (22.4 mg) compared with
those in the group treated with tamoxifen (60 mg) (difference ⫽
37.6 mg, 95% ci ⫽ 26.5 to 48.7 mg) indicate that estrogen
production was effectively inhibited by letrozole. tumors in the
mice switched from tamoxifen to the second-line combination of
tamoxifen plus letrozole therapy also regressed during the first
week of treatment, but regression was less pronounced compared with that in mice receiving second-line letrozole alone.
thereafter, tumors proliferated slowly, increasing in volume by
2.5-fold over the next 11 weeks of treatment.
the tumors of mice that received first-line treatment with the
combination of tamoxifen plus letrozole doubled in volume after
18 weeks. at week 20 of treatment, the mice remaining in this

mice treated with the combination of tamoxifen (100 ␮g/day) plus letrozole (10
␮g/day) (n ⫽ 9) doubled in volume after 18 weeks of treatment. after 20 weeks
of treatment, the mice were divided into separate groups for continued treatment
with the same combination (n ⫽ 3) or for second-line treatment with letrozole
alone (10 ␮g/day) (n ⫽ 3) or tamoxifen alone (100 ␮g/day) (n ⫽ 3). second-line
treatment lasted for 12 weeks, and tumor volumes were measured weekly for a
total of 32 weeks. tumor volumes are expressed as the percent change relative
to the initial tumor volume. tumor weight in the tamoxifen plus letrozole group
was higher than that in the letrozole-alone group. at week 32, tumor volumes in
the group treated with letrozole alone were lower than those in all other treatment
groups. b) after the 12 weeks of second-line treatments, the mice were killed,
and the tumors and uteri were removed, cleaned, and weighed. the estimated
difference in mean tumor weight between the tamoxifen plus letrozole group was
greater than that in the letrozole-alone group (362.2, 95% confidence interval ⫽
17.4 to 706.6). the uterine weight was also greater in the tamoxifen plus
letrozole group than in the letrozole-alone group. the estimated difference in
mean uterine weight between these groups was 45.7 (95% confidence interval ⫽
12.5 to 78.9). error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.

mice switched to letrozole alone regressed for the first 2 weeks
before doubling in volume during the following 12 weeks of
treatment. moreover, mean weights of tumors in mice switched
to letrozole were lower than those in mice treated with tamoxifen
or with the combination of tamoxifen plus letrozole (difference
between letrozole-treated mice and mice receiving combination
treatment ⫽ 362.2 mg, 95% ci ⫽ 17.4 to 706.6 mg) (fig. 4, b).

our data indicate that first-line treatment of an antiestrogenand aromatase inhibitor–responsive breast cancer model with the

in the letrozole-alone group were killed at 56 weeks. there was no statistically
significant difference in tumor volume between any of the groups.

tively) at week 32 (fig. 4, a). uterine weights were also lower
with letrozole treatment than with combination treatment (difference ⫽ 45.7 mg, 95% ci ⫽ 12.5 to 78.9 mg) (p ⫽ .006),
indicating that letrozole was inhibiting intratumoral estrogen
production, even though tumors progressed on the treatments.
after 34 weeks of first-line letrozole therapy, the 12 remaining mice were divided into three groups with similar (i.e., not
statistically significantly different) tumor volumes for continued
treatment with letrozole (n ⫽ 3), second-line treatment with
tamoxifen (n ⫽ 5), or second-line treatment with the pure
antiestrogen  xxxd2165xxx  (n ⫽ 3) for the next 12 weeks (fig. 5).
(the combination of tamoxifen plus letrozole was not examined
because it had become clear that this combination was providing
results similar to treatment with tamoxifen alone.) tumor volumes in mice switched to second-line tamoxifen or  xxxd2165xxx 
therapy continued to proliferate, with no reduction in tumor
growth rate relative to that in mice continued on letrozole
treatment. no statistically significant differences in tumor
weights among the three treatment groups were found at the end
of the experiment. thus, antiestrogens may not be effective
second-line treatment for tumors progressing on letrozole therapy. however, as expected,  xxxd2165xxx  was less estrogenic than
tamoxifen because uteri were not hyperplastic and weighed
statistically significantly less than uteri in mice receiving
second-line tamoxifen treatment (mean difference ⫽ 65.9 mg,
95% ci ⫽ 40.7 to 91.0 mg).

led to a response equivalent to that seen with 500 ␮g/day of
tamoxifen. thus, when levels of estrogen were suppressed by
letrozole in the combination group (fig. 1, a), tumor volumes
were similar to those in the group treated with tamoxifen alone
but not to those in the group treated with letrozole alone. the
agonist effects of tamoxifen were also apparent from the finding
of hyperplastic uteri in mice treated with the combination of
tamoxifen and letrozole compared with decreased uterine
weights in mice treated with letrozole alone (fig. 2, b). in
addition, tumor volumes increased in the alternating treatment
regimens when tamoxifen was administered after 4 weeks of
letrozole therapy, regardless of whether treatments began with
letrozole or with tamoxifen. this result contrasts with the effects
of tamoxifen administered as a first-line treatment, in which
tumor growth was held static for the first 8 weeks of treatment,
suggesting that the agonist effect of tamoxifen is apparent only
when estrogen is absent. the failure of both alternating regimens
to delay time to tumor progression relative to letrozole alone
appears to be due to the fact that when therapy was alternated
from letrozole to tamoxifen, tumor growth increased rapidly. it
remains to be determined whether these findings will be confirmed when the results of the breast international group/
 xxxd2459xxx -tamoxifen (big/femta) trial are released. this adjuvant trial is comparing the effects of alternating letrozole for 2–3
years with tamoxifen for 2–3 years and alternating tamoxifen for
2–3 years with letrozole for 2–3 years [reviewed in (7)]. the
preclinical data presented here raise the possibility that, following 2–3 years of letrozole therapy, tumors of some patients may
recognize tamoxifen as an estrogen agonist, causing the treatment to be inferior to single-agent therapy with letrozole.
in addition to determining the efficacy of combination therapy, our second aim was to determine the optimal sequence of
endocrine treatments and, in addition, the effect of second-line
therapies on tumor progression. when tumors doubled in volume after 16 weeks of tamoxifen treatment, some mice were
assigned to treatment with letrozole or a combination of tamoxifen plus letrozole. second-line therapy with letrozole alone
proved better than that with the combination, possibly because
tumors recognized tamoxifen as a weak estrogen that stimulates
tumor growth to some extent. it is interesting to note that
second-line treatment with letrozole was not as effective as
first-line treatment with letrozole. first-line letrozole treatment
caused tumor regression for the first 4 weeks of treatment, after
which tumors grew at a very slow rate. by contrast, second-line
letrozole treatment after tamoxifen caused regression for only 1
week before the tumors began to proliferate at a faster rate. a
similar finding has been observed in patients (4,33,34). when
letrozole was compared with  xxxd2557xxx  and  xxxd147xxx  as second-line therapy for tamoxifen-refractory breast
cancer, the objective response rates were 24% and 19%, respectively (33,34). however, when letrozole was compared with
tamoxifen as first-line treatment for advanced breast cancer, the
overall response rate was 32% with letrozole versus 21% with
tamoxifen (35). anastrozole, when administered as first-line
treatment, provides an objective response in 21%–33% of patients (1–3), but when this drug was administered as second-line
treatment for tamoxifen-refractory breast cancer, objective responses occurred in only 10% of the patients (36). similar
findings have been reported for exemestane (5,37). the biologic
mechanisms underlying these results are unknown, but the data

tumor progression approximately twofold compared with tamoxifen (34 weeks versus 16 weeks). we also found that combining tamoxifen with letrozole or alternating 4-week courses of
tamoxifen and letrozole did not extend time to tumor progression. indeed, compared with tamoxifen therapy alone or tamoxifen alternating with letrozole or letrozole alternating with tamoxifen, letrozole therapy alone led to a statistically significant
inhibition of tumor growth (p⬍.001) and delayed the time to
tumor progression.
we also found that the combination of tamoxifen plus letrozole was equivalent to tamoxifen alone. this result parallels the
recently published findings of the anastrozole, tamoxifen,
alone or in combination (atac) trial (6). the atac trial
compared the nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor anastrozole alone
or in combination with tamoxifen with tamoxifen alone as
adjuvant therapies for postmenopausal patients with early-stage
breast cancer. after a median follow-up of 33.3 months, diseasefree survival was 89.4% in the patients receiving anastrozole and
was statistically significantly higher than the disease-free survival (87.4%) in patients receiving tamoxifen (odds ratio [or]
⫽ 0.83, 95% ci ⫽ 0.71 to 0.96; p ⫽ .013). disease-free survival
after combination treatment (87.2%) was not statistically significantly different from that after treatment with tamoxifen alone
(or ⫽ 1.02, 95% ci ⫽ 0.89 to 1.18; p ⫽ .8). moreover, the
incidence of contralateral breast cancer was statistically significantly lower in patients receiving anastrozole than in patients
receiving tamoxifen or the combination (or ⫽ 0.42, 95% ci ⫽
0.22 to 0.79; p ⫽ .007). these results are consistent with those
of our previous studies of both anastrozole and letrozole in
combination with tamoxifen (17), as well as with the results of
this study.
two possibilities could explain why combining a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor with tamoxifen did not provide advantages over treatment with the aromatase inhibitor alone. one
possibility is that the combination of tamoxifen plus an aromatase inhibitor results in reduced serum letrozole levels in
mice. indeed, statistically significant reductions in serum letrozole levels of approximately 37% (p⬍.001) (27,28) and in
serum anastrozole levels of 27% (29) have been observed in
patients receiving these drugs in combination with tamoxifen.
however, the reductions in plasma levels of these aromatase
inhibitors in patients receiving combination therapy did not
result in changes in circulating estrogen levels, which remained
low (27). in our study, when letrozole and tamoxifen were
combined, the serum levels of both declined slightly but not
statistically significantly, by 27% for letrozole and by 11% for
tamoxifen. it is clear that, in mice receiving combination therapy, the available levels of letrozole were sufficient to inhibit
estrogen production, as shown by a reduction in uterine weight.
moreover, in previous studies (16,17), we found that letrozole
administered to mice at half the dose used in this study (i.e., 5
␮g/day) had statistically significant antitumor activity. it should
also be noted that tamoxifen at lower doses (e.g., 60 ␮g/day) has
been found to have considerable antitumor activity in mice (16).
a second possible explanation for the lack of improvement
with the combination is that the elimination of 99% of estrogens
from the body with letrozole treatment (30) causes the partial
estrogen agonistic effects of tamoxifen to become apparent
(31,32). even though the estrogen level in the xenograft tumors
may be higher than the concentration in patients’ tumors, the
dose of tamoxifen used (100 ␮g/day) was clearly effective and

zole, and survival with second-line letrozole is substantially
longer than with second-line tamoxifen (35).
in summary, we have used a hormone-responsive xenograft
model and shown that the aromatase inhibitor letrozole is superior, in terms of time to tumor progression, as a first-line treatment to the antiestrogen tamoxifen, to a combination of tamoxifen plus letrozole, and to therapies that alternate tamoxifen with
letrozole (and vice versa). letrozole was also determined to be
an effective second-line treatment for tumors progressing on
tamoxifen alone and on the combination. however, the antiestrogens tamoxifen and  xxxd2165xxx  did not appear to be effective
for tumors progressing on letrozole. therefore, further studies
are needed to determine the optimal second-line therapy for
patients whose tumors progress after letrozole therapy.

rate than tamoxifen alone. recent data from the m17 trial (38)
suggest that patients who received letrozole following 5 years of
tamoxifen treatment for early-stage breast cancer experienced
fewer recurrences (75 among 2593 patients) than patients receiving placebo (132 among 2594 control subjects). this is an
important advantage because there is no evidence that extending
tamoxifen treatment beyond 5 years increases its benefits (8).
similarly, tumors progressing on the tamoxifen plus letrozole
combination responded to second-line letrozole. nevertheless,
letrozole was statistically significantly better than tamoxifen at
slowing tumor growth because, when switched to tamoxifen,
tumors that received first-line treatment with the tamoxifen plus
letrozole combination continued to proliferate rapidly. the clinical relevance of this finding may be that patients in the atac
trial who progress while on the combination of anastrozole and
tamoxifen might respond better to second-line therapy with
anastrozole alone than to tamoxifen.
tumors progressing on letrozole treatment at 34 weeks were
switched to either tamoxifen or the pure antiestrogen  xxxd2165xxx .
surprisingly, neither tamoxifen nor  xxxd2165xxx  was an effective
second-line treatment for tumors actively progressing on letrozole. this finding is in contrast to our previous report, which
indicated that both drugs, but especially  xxxd2165xxx , were effective
second-line treatments for tumors that had progressed on letrozole (25). however, the experimental design of the two studies
was different. in our previous study, tumors progressing on
letrozole therapy were transplanted into new mice, and letrozole,
but not the ⌬ xxxd176xxx  supplement, was withdrawn for
8 weeks until tumors were established. that study was designed
to determine whether tumors that recur following limited
aromatase-inhibitor therapy remain sensitive to second-line therapies with antiestrogens, and it found that both tamoxifen and
 xxxd2165xxx  treatment were effective at inhibiting tumor growth.
that experiment was similar in some respects to the atac and
big/femta adjuvant trials, in which administration of the
aromatase inhibitor is limited to 5 years. this study, by contrast,
models advanced (metastatic) disease, in which patients relapsing on an aromatase inhibitor or an antiestrogen are switched
directly to the other class of drug. the data from this study
indicate that when advanced tumors were switched from an
aromatase inhibitor directly to an antiestrogen, tumors continued
to progress, with no statistically significant difference between
any of the second-line treatment groups.
we (25) and others (39) have reported that long-term estrogen deprivation of mcf-7 cells in vitro is associated with
increased expression of the  xxxg730xxx . masamura et al.
(40) reported that the high levels of  xxxg730xxx  hypersensitize the cells to low levels of estrogens and consequently to the
growth-inhibitory effects of pure antiestrogens. the data presented in our in vivo study (25) suggest that long-term estrogen
deprivation with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole is not associated with increased levels of expression of estrogen receptors
and that the mcf-7ca tumor cells are not hypersensitive to
estrogens or antiestrogens. in fact, we found that tumors receiving long-term letrozole treatment were growth refractory to
second-line treatments with both tamoxifen and  xxxd2165xxx . clinically, there is minimal response to tamoxifen as second-line
therapy in advanced breast cancer patients refractory to letro-
