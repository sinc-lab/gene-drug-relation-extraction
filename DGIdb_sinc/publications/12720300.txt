defective processing of the transforming growth factor- xxxg836xxx  in azoxymethane-induced mouse colon tumors.  high levels of the cell growth inhibitor transforming growth factor- xxxg836xxx  ( xxxg2269xxx ) are often found in a variety of human cancers. however, the physiological significance of this overexpression depends on the availability of the biologically active form of  xxxg2269xxx  within the extracellular matrix of the tumor microenvironment. to determine the expression and activation status of  xxxg2269xxx  in chemically induced tumors, 6-wk-old a/j mice were injected intraperitoneally with either azoxymethane (aom) (10 mg/kg body weight, once a week for 6 wk) or normal saline solution, and colon tumors were isolated 24 wk following the last injection. an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for  xxxg2269xxx  revealed a significant increase (1.7-fold, p < 0.05) in total  xxxg2269xxx  protein in tumors. interestingly, while 80% of the total  xxxg2269xxx  in the control colon tissues was in the active form, only 50% was found to be active in tumors. together with our earlier observations that  xxxg2269xxx  mrna levels are unchanged in a/j tumors, these data further support a mechanism whereby elevated  xxxg2269xxx  levels result from a defective activation and turnover of this protein. because  xxxg1775xxx  is known to be a major activator of  xxxg2269xxx  in vivo, we hypothesized that reduced  xxxg1775xxx  activity may be responsible for the observed dysregulation of  xxxg2269xxx  processing in these behaviorally benign tumors. with a fluorogenic peptide substrate for serine proteases, a deficiency in  xxxg1775xxx  activity was found in the tumors. furthermore, semiquantitative reverse transcription (rt)-polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis of a panel of genes involved in the  xxxg1775xxx  activation system, including  xxxg1775xxx  activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1), urokinase- xxxg1775xxx  activator ( xxxg1767xxx ), and urokinase-receptor ( xxxg1768xxx -1), demonstrated a significant upregulation (approximately fourfold to sixfold, p < 0.05) in the expression of each of these genes in the tumor tissue. in addition, no significant changes were observed in the expression levels of  xxxg2278xxx  ( xxxg2278xxx ) and insulin-like growth factor type ii receptor (igf-iir), which also mediate the activation of latent  xxxg2269xxx . to gain further insight into the functionality of the  xxxg2269xxx  pathway, cdna microarrays were performed and the expression levels of a panel of 21  xxxg2269xxx -specific target genes were determined in aom-induced tumors that overexpress the ligand. a significant dysregulation in the expression of each of these targets was observed, providing evidence of aberrant  xxxg2269xxx  signaling in tumors. overall, the present study demonstrates a very low  xxxg1775xxx  activity in a/j colon tumors, possibly as a result of the potent inhibitory effect of pai-1 on the  xxxg1775xxx  activation cascade. the observed deficiency in  xxxg1775xxx  activity may not be sufficiently compensated for by other mechanisms of latent  xxxg2269xxx  activation, including  xxxg2278xxx  and igf-iir, thereby resulting in a decreased fraction of the biologically active form of  xxxg2269xxx  and subsequent aberration in  xxxg2269xxx -specific gene regulation in a/j tumors.
