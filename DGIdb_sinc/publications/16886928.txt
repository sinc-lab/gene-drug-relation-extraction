 xxxd1914xxx  inhibits  xxxg1701xxx  (pde5) and adenosine re-uptake. the
most prominent side-effect is headache. we examined the migraine-generating
effects of  xxxd1914xxx  as well as the cerebral blood velocity response in a singleblind study, including 10 patients with migraine without aura and 10 healthy
subjects.  xxxd1914xxx  0.142 mg/kg per min was administered intravenously.
headache intensity was scored on a verbal rating scale along with pain characteristics and accompanying symptoms. blood velocity in the middle cerebral artery
(vmca), blood pressure and heart rate were recorded repeatedly. headache was
induced in all migraine patients and in eight of 10 healthy subjects (p = 0.47) with
no signiﬁcant difference in headache intensity (p = 0.53). however, ﬁve patients
but only one healthy subject experienced the symptoms of migraine without aura,
according to ichd-2 criteria, within 12 h (p = 0.14). four patients reported photophobia after  xxxd1914xxx  compared with no healthy subjects (p = 0.087). vmca
decreased (p < 0.001) during and after  xxxd1914xxx  infusion with no difference
between groups (p = 0.15) coinciding with initiation, but not cessation of immediate headache. thus,  xxxd1914xxx  induces symptoms of migraine and an initial
decrease in vmca in migraine patients, but not signiﬁcantly more than in healthy
subjects. this relatively low frequency of migraine induction, compared with
 xxxd2738xxx  donors and sildenaﬁl, is probably due to the less speciﬁc action of
 xxxd1914xxx  on the cgmp signalling pathway as well as a possible bidirectional
effect of adenosine on migraine induction.  blood ﬂow velocity,  xxxd1914xxx ,

introduction
oral  xxxd1914xxx  ( xxxd1914xxx ®) in combination with
aspirin is widely used in the secondary prevention
of stroke (1), whereas intravenous administration of
 xxxd1914xxx  is used as a cardiac stress test (2).  xxxd1914xxx  appears to work through two different
signalling systems, the camp- and the cgmp-related
pathways (3, 4). the most common side-effect in the
clinical use of  xxxd1914xxx  is headache occurring
in approximately 38% after oral administration, causing discontinuation of treatment in 8% of patients (5)
© blackwell publishing ltd cephalalgia, 2006, 26, 925–933

and occurring in 32–37% after routine intravenous
administration (6, 7).
we have previously shown that intravenous
administration of  xxxd1914xxx  induces headache
with a concomitant but not completely time-related
minor dilation of the cerebral arteries in eight of 10
healthy subjects (8). also, oral administration of
another, but more selective inhibitor of  xxxg1701xxx  (pde5), sildenaﬁl (viagra®) has recently
been shown to induce headache in healthy subjects
(9) with more severe headache, fulﬁlling the criteria
for migraine in migraine patients (10). sildenaﬁl

caused no signiﬁcant changes in middle cerebral
artery diameter or regional cerebral blood ﬂow. in
healthy subjects, circulating adenosine was recently
found to induce a very mild headache with only
extracranial vasodilation and, in a few subjects, a
delayed headache was initiated (11). whether  xxxd1914xxx  is able to induce signiﬁcantly more headaches, a larger arterial dilation and perhaps an attack
of migraine in migraine patients has not previously
been systematically investigated.
we wished to test the hypothesis that  xxxd1914xxx  is able to induce symptoms of migraine in
migraine patients and headache in healthy subjects,
just like  xxxd2741xxx  (gtn) and sildenaﬁl.
the primary endpoint was to investigate whether
 xxxd1914xxx  can induce symptoms of migraine, in
order to elucidate if  xxxd1914xxx  may be used in
the human migraine model. the secondary endpoints were to elucidate, ﬁrst, if the induced headache was of higher intensity, and second, if a
vascular response was more pronounced in migraine
patients compared with healthy controls.
compared with the oral sildenaﬁl, the advantage
of using  xxxd1914xxx  in the human migraine model
is that  xxxd1914xxx  is available for both oral and
intravenous use just like gtn, whereas sildenaﬁl is
available only for oral administration. the intravenous administration in the human migraine model
helps to eliminate the potential variability in bioavailability after oral administration and makes it
easier to time the intended investigations. the pde5
inhibitor effects of  xxxd1914xxx  make it a likely
candidate for investigating the migraine-generating
mechanisms downstream of gtn.

methods
design and material
the study was a single-blind study where  xxxd1914xxx  0.142 mg/kg per min was administered
intravenously for 4 min in 10 healthy subjects, seven
women and three men, mean age 29.7 years (range
22–45), body weight 69.8 ± 5 kg, and in 10 patients
suffering from migraine without aura, eight women
and two men, mean age 35.7 years (range 20–47),
body weight 73.5 ± 3.5 kg. the healthy subjects
served as a control group for the migraine patients.
the groups were matched according to age (p = 0.15)
and body weight (p = 0.56). except for one subject,
they were also matched for sex.
subjects were recruited among hospital staff and
medical students. migraine patients were recruited
mainly from the headache clinic.

the number of subjects included was based on
previous studies of the gtn model (12, 13). in relation to applying  xxxd1914xxx  as a migraineprovoking substance in the migraine model, it
would be of interest only if  xxxd1914xxx  induced
migraine with the same frequency as gtn or
sildenaﬁl. in these studies, 10 and 12 subjects were
included and thus 10 subjects in each group were
chosen for the present study.
inclusion of subjects was performed by one investigator (s.o.). those performing the measurements
and asking questions of headache, investigator
(l.h.l.) and study technician (k.e.), were blinded to
the status (patient or healthy subject) of the subjects
investigated. furthermore, the participants were not
informed that the purpose of the study was to detect
a difference in headache response between the two
groups.
the  xxxd1914xxx  dose used was similar to that
used for routine cardiovascular performance tests (2)
and in a previous study in healthy subjects (8). an
intravenous formulation was chosen to avoid known
variation in bioavailability after oral administration
(3). placebo was not included in this pilot study since
the primary endpoint was to detect a difference
between healthy subjects and migraine patients.
exclusion criteria for all subjects were a medical
history of pulmonary disorders, cerebro- or cardiovascular disorders, hypo- or hypertension, a history
of alcohol or drug abuse or psychiatric disease. only
subjects with a normal ecg were included. the
healthy subjects had no history of migraine and a
headache frequency <5 days a month. they were
without a family history of migraine, i.e. no ﬁrstdegree relative with migraine.
the migraine patients had a migraine frequency
ranging from 5 per year to 6 per month and tensiontype headache <5 days a month. no prophylactic
treatment for migraine was allowed. all subjects
gave written informed consent before inclusion and
a medical examination, including an ecg, was performed prior to the study. the study was approved
by the ethics committee of copenhagen county
(ka93086) and the danish health authorities and
was conducted according to the helsinki ii
declaration.

headache recordings
headache intensity was scored on an 11-point
numerical verbal scale from 0 to 10 during the study,
where 1 represents a very mild headache (including
a feeling of pressing or throbbing), 5 a headache of
moderate intensity and 10 the worst headache

 xxxd1914xxx  and migraine
imaginable (12). headache characteristics, headache
location and other side-effects were also recorded.
all subjects were asked to record their headache, the
headache characteristics and any intake of medication every hour at home in a headache diary from 2
to 10 h following the  xxxd1914xxx  infusion. the
subjects were allowed to treat their headache at
home with plain analgesics (paracetamols, aspirin,
non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug) or migraine
medication (sumatriptan). time for intake and drugs
used were recorded in the headache diary. due to
the pharmacokinetic proﬁle of  xxxd1914xxx , with a
tri-exponential decline with the major decline within
the ﬁrst hour, immediate headache is deﬁned as
headache occurring within the ﬁrst hour after infusion and delayed from 2 to 12 h (14).

blood ﬂow velocity
a time-averaged mean of the maximal blood velocities in the middle cerebral artery (vmca), comprising
at least one cardiac cycle, was recorded bilaterally by
transcranial doppler (tcd) (2 mhz, 3-d transscan;
eme, uberlingen, germany) using handheld probes
(15) as previously described in a validated set-up (8,
16). a ﬁxed point for measurements of vmca was chosen along the middle cerebral artery. measurements
of endtidal pco2 (petco2) were performed simultaneously with the tcd measurements (poet; criticare systems incorporated, waukesha, wi, usa)
using a mask placed lightly over the nose and mouth
(16).

procedures
the subject arrived non-fasting, headache free on the
day of the study. no coffee, tea or other caffeinecontaining drinks (no methylxanthine-containing
compounds), alcohol, tobacco, chocolate, medication
or smoking were allowed for at least 12 h prior to the
study. migraine patients were free of attack at least
48 h before the study day. the subjects were kept in
a supine position during the study. after 30 min rest,
baseline measurements of blood pressure, heart rate,
petco2 and vmca were performed.  xxxd1914xxx  was
infused for 4 min. vmca was recorded and headaches
as well as headache characteristics were scored at
3 min, 7 min, 10 min and then every 10 min until
60 min after infusion of  xxxd1914xxx .
blood pressure and heart rate were measured
repeatedly using an automatically inﬂated arm-cuff
(tonoprint; speidel + keller gmbh, jungingen, germany). ecg was recorded continuously during the
study.

because of the blinding procedures all subjects
received sumatriptan 100 mg for rescue medication.

statistics
all values are presented as means ± standard error
of the mean (sem). p < 0.05 was considered
signiﬁcant.
the area under the curve (auc) and the peak
response for each variable, vmca, blood pressure,
heart rate and petco2 on the separate days was chosen as summary measure when analysing difference
in response between study groups and compared
using an unpaired t-test. changes over time for
the variables were analysed with two-way analyses
of variance with factors time and subjects. the
manova was repeated for each single variable. if an
overall effect of time was found, further analysis was
performed using a multiple range test for location of
signiﬁcant changes (statgraphics 3.3). differences in
headache response between healthy subjects and
migraine patients (auc and median peak response)
were analysed using the mann–whitney test and the
differences in the occurrence of headache, migraine
and accompanying symptoms were analysed by
fisher’s exact test. the headache data were divided
into two groups (0–60 min and 2–12 h) and analysed
both separately and together.

results
headache and accompanying symptoms
headache scores over time are shown in fig. 1a,b,
healthy and migraine patients, respectively. headache was induced in all migraine patients and in
eight of 10 healthy subjects (p = 0.47) (table 1 and
fig. 2). the headache in ﬁve patients but only in one
healthy subject fulﬁlled the symptoms of the ichd2 criteria for migraine without aura within 12 h
(p = 0.14) (fig. 2). the latter only in the ﬁrst 10 min
from infusion corresponded to a steep increase in
heart rate, from 75 to 129 beats/min within the ﬁrst
7 min. one patient reported a mild headache with a
similar location to usual migraine, but with no
accompanying symptoms (table 2). there were no
signiﬁcant differences in headache intensity between
groups (p = 0.53). headache characteristics are
shown in detail for migraine patients in table 2.
time to fulﬁlment of the symptoms of migraine
without aura according to ichd-2 varied between
10 min and 11 h. the immediate median peak
headache scores (0–60 min) were 2 (range 0–5) in
migraine patients and 1.5 (range 0–5) in healthy

headache scores are shown as thin lines. a thick line indicates
the median headache score over time in healthy subjects (a,
) and in migraine patients (b, ). there were no differences
in headache intensities between groups, but ﬁve of 10
migraine patients fulﬁlled the ichd-2 criteria for migraine
without aura postdose.

subjects (p = 0.85) and delayed median peak headache scores (2–12 h) were 1.5 (range 0–8) and 2
(range 0–7) in migraine patients and healthy subjects, respectively (p = 0.97) with no signiﬁcant dif-

ference in the auc (p = 0.90 and p = 0.40, immediate
and delayed headache, respectively).
four migraine patients reported photophobia following  xxxd1914xxx  infusion, three of them already
within the ﬁrst 60 min. the intensity of the photophobia was reported to be mild in two, moderate in
one and severe in one patient (table 2). no healthy
subjects experienced photophobia (p = 0.087). the
occurrences of phonophobia (three in both group)
and nausea (ﬁve healthy subjects and four migraine
patients, with more patients reporting nausea of
moderate intensity) were not signiﬁcantly different
between groups (p = 1).
a mild degree of ﬂushing and, in some, a feeling
of heaviness in the body were reported during and
immediately after infusion of  xxxd1914xxx  in both
groups. rescue medication was taken at home by
two migraine patients (both oral sumatriptan
100 mg) and three healthy subjects (one took  xxxd2315xxx  200 mg, one paracetamol 1 g and one the
tablet of sumatriptan 100 mg received at discharge
from the study site).

middle cerebral artery blood velocity (vmca)
because of no signiﬁcant side difference in vmca
(auc p = 0.42 and p = 0.2, patients and healthy,
respectively) the data were analysed as a mean
between the two sides. in both groups  xxxd1914xxx 
induced a signiﬁcant decrease in vmca lasting 60 min
following the start of infusion (p < 0.001, manova)
(fig. 3). baseline vmca was 74.4 ± 4.4 cm/s for healthy
subjects and 69.6 ± 4.6 cm/s for migraine patients
(p = 0.46). the peak decrease was 22 ± 2.0% for
migraine patients and 18.7 ± 2.2% for healthy subjects (p = 0.28, between groups). the decrease in vmca
was partly due to a signiﬁcant reduction in petco2
(p < 0.05, manova) in both groups (p = 0.39, auc
and p = 0.94 peak) (fig. 3). petco2 returned to

(p < 0.001) within the ﬁrst 30 min from the start of
 xxxd1914xxx  infusion with no difference between
groups (p = 0.54 and p = 0.91, auc and peak, respectively). no abnormal ecg recordings were detected
during the study. the subjects showed no change in
behaviour and made no complaint of any increase in
heart rate.

discussion

petco2 were 4.9 ± 0.1 kpa and 4.9 ± 0.2 kpa in
migraine patients and healthy subjects, respectively.
when correcting vmca for the petco2 changes (17), the
peak decrease in blood ﬂow was only 16.3 ± 2.7% in
migraine patients and 10.1 ± 1.3% in healthy subjects
(p = 0.32).

transient immediate headache fulﬁlling the ichd2 criteria for migraine. migraine patients, but
no healthy subjects, experienced photophobia
(p = 0.087), accompanied by slightly more severe
nausea compared with healthy subjects. concurrent
with immediate headache,  xxxd1914xxx  caused a
partly petco2-dependent decrease in blood velocity
in the middle cerebral arteries of similar magnitude
in both healthy subjects and migraine patients. a
 xxxd1914xxx -induced decrease in end-expiratory
petco2 and in blood ﬂow has been reported
previously (8, 18).
the induction of migraine has not previously been
considered, although a possible migraine-generating
effect was suggested earlier (19). a trial, planned to
include 50 migraine patients receiving oral  xxxd1914xxx  100 mg four times a day for 12 weeks, had
to be terminated after inclusion of only nine patients,
because of severe headaches in the subjects within
the ﬁrst days of treatment (19).

what may be the mechanisms of dipyridamoleinduced headache and migraine? the exact mechanism of action is not fully understood.  xxxd1914xxx 
may work through two different pathways. it is an
unspeciﬁc inhibitor of cgmp degrading enzyme
(pde5) (4), thus increasing cgmp concentrations (20,
21). it furthermore inhibits adenosine re-uptake, thus
increasing the circulating plasma adenosine as well
as intercellular adenosine, which leads to an
increased intracellular camp (3).  xxxd1914xxx  has
also been associated with the release of calcitonin
gene-related peptide (cgrp), which may act through
camp (22). both the cgmp (10, 13) and the camp
pathways (11, 23) affected by  xxxd1914xxx  appear
involved in headache and migraine generation, and
the former is not necessarily related to cerebral
vasodilation (9, 10).  xxxd2738xxx  (no) donors
increase cgmp and generate headache resembling
the patients’ usual migraine attacks by yet unknown
mechanisms (24). furthermore, an inhibitor of no

synthase,  xxxd3291xxx , is effective in acute treatment
of migraine attacks (25). plasma concentrations of
cgrp are increased during migraine headache (26)
and a new interesting proof of concept in migraine
treatment is the use of cgrp receptor antagonists
(27). increased concentrations of circulating adenosine (28) as well as of plasma camp in the jugular
vein (29) have also been associated with migraine.
adenosine may, however, have a dual and opposing
effect in migraine pathophysiology which could
counteract the cgmp migraine-inducing effects of
 xxxd1914xxx . apart from increasing camp levels
which can induce headache, adenosine may also
stimulate the neuronal adenosine a1 receptors,
which appear to inhibit neuronal signalling (30), an
effect suggested to be involved in  xxxd234xxx  (31).
could the  xxxd1914xxx  headache be a direct consequence of the vascular changes? the decrease in
vmca induced by  xxxd1914xxx  was approximately
20% without correction for changes in petco2 and
less when correcting. petco2 returned to baseline
before the blood velocity changes. thus, the persistent decrease in vmca may indicate a minor vasodilatory response in the middle cerebral arteries, as

previously described (8). for comparison, gtn
induced an approximately 25% decrease in vmca in
previous studies (8) with a more pronounced
decrease in migraine patients, which was not found
in the present study. the decrease in vmca outlasted
the change in heart rate, indicating that the heart rate
changes do not fully explain the vmca changes.
despite these small changes in vmca, a pure vascular
mechanism of headache induction appears unlikely:
(i) the  xxxd1914xxx -induced vmca changes are only
time-related to the initiation of the immediate headache but not the cessation, as previously shown, thus
the immediate headache declined before normalization of blood ﬂow velocity (8); (ii) the peak increase
in heart rate of 43% in healthy subjects and 53% in
migraine patients is similar to that reported after
adenosine infusion (11), which caused only very
mild headache compared with the present study and
no symptoms of migraine.
all subjects were asked to refrain from intake of
caffeine-containing beverages 12 h prior to the study,
and a caffeine withdrawal headache might bias the
current results. however, the reported immediate
headache was seen in close association with infusion

of  xxxd1914xxx , and the subjects were allowed
intake of caffeine after discharge, rendering it
unlikely that the migraine was due to caffeine withdrawal alone. other environmental factors affecting
the subjects after discharge might also inﬂuence the
induction of delayed headache; however, for practical purposes it is not possible to keep the subjects in
hospital during the following 24 h and, also, it cannot be excluded that the stress of being hospitalized
also increased the likelihood of headache induction.
in the present study  xxxd1914xxx  was not as
potent as other cgmp elevating compounds, used
for a human migraine model, in inducing migraine
in migraine patients. the low frequency of migraine
induction by  xxxd1914xxx  renders it unsuitable for
use in a human headache and migraine model. thus,
 xxxd1914xxx  is not a good replacement for or supplement to the gtn migraine model (12), where
eight of 10 reported a migraine attack postdose (13).
nor can it replace the cgmp-elevating pde5 inhibitor sildenaﬁl, which induced migraine in 10 of 12
migraine patients (10, 13) despite the advantages of
intravenous administration.
the frequency of migraine induction by  xxxd1914xxx  appears more similar to the frequency of
migraine induction by the camp-elevating compounds such as human alpha-cgrp, where three of nine
patients reported fulﬁlment of ichd-2 criteria for
migraine without aura (23). intravenous administration of adenosine (11), however, was not as effective
as the other camp-related mechanisms in headache
induction in healthy subjects, perhaps because of a
poor penetration of the blood–brain barrier (22, 23,
32) or effect on  xxxg81xxx  associated
with  xxxd234xxx  (33, 34).
in conclusion,  xxxd1914xxx  induces headache in
both healthy subjects and migraine patients with no
difference in headache intensity. five of 10 migraine
patients met the criteria of migraine without aura
after  xxxd1914xxx , making  xxxd1914xxx  a less
potent migraine-inducing compound than gtn or
sildenaﬁl. the dual actions of  xxxd1914xxx  may
explain this difference in migraine frequency, since
the cgmp effects through pde5 inhibition may be
counteracted by the adenosine effects on a1 receptors.
the relatively low frequency of migraine induction makes it less useful in a human migraine model
than, for example, gtn or sildenaﬁl.
