abstract
 xxxd2715xxx  and its derivative, acipimox, have been widely used in the treatment of hyperlipidemia. pharmacological studies
have demonstrated that they exert the beneﬁcial eﬀect through the activation of a gi-protein-coupled receptor on adipocyte, which
has remained elusive to date. here we show that a novel gpcr, designated hm74b because of its high similarity to  xxxg1027xxx , is a
receptor for  xxxd2715xxx . hm74b mrna is found in human, murine, and rat adipose tissues.  xxxd2715xxx  and acipimox inhibit
 xxxd1742xxx -stimulated intracellular camp accumulation in human hm74b-expressing cells and activate gtpcs binding in a dosedependent manner. [3 h] xxxd2715xxx  speciﬁcally binds to hm74b-expressing membrane and its binding is replaced by acipimox.
this ﬁnding will open a new phase of research on the physiological role of  xxxd2715xxx  and will be a clue to develop novel
antihyperlipidemic drugs.

 xxxd2715xxx  (niacin) is a member of water-soluble
vitamins. based on its well-known plasma lipid-lowering
eﬀect,  xxxd2715xxx  and its derivative, e.g., acipimox
[1], have been used clinically in the treatment for hyperlipidemia. these substances are known to lower elevated plasma concentration of low-density lipoprotein
(ldl), intermediate-density lipoprotein, very low-density lipoprotein (vldl), triglycerides (tg), and lipoprotein lp(a), and also increase plasma high density
lipoprotein (hdl) concentrations, resulting in an improvement of mortality rate against coronary artery
disease [2]. although the exact mechanism of the action
of  xxxd2715xxx  on lipoprotein metabolism is still unknown, its inhibitory eﬀect on fat-mobilizing lipolysis in

adipose tissue is considered as the most plausible explanation of this beneﬁcial mechanism. plasma free fatty
acid is known as a substance of vldl synthesis in the
liver. the decrease of the free fatty acid lowers the circulating levels of both plasma tg and ldl cholesterol
[3]. in adipocytes,  xxxd2715xxx  is reported to inhibit
lipolysis by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase [4], which inactivates  xxxg1836xxx , resulting in the suppression of
 xxxg1330xxx  [5]. recently, a target molecule
for  xxxd2715xxx  was reported as a g-protein-coupled
receptor existing in the rat spleen, adipose, and macrophages [6,7], which has remained elusive to date.
the recent progress in genetic analysis technologies
enables us to identify and characterize numbers of novel
orphan gpcrs, and we have succeeded in clarifying
novel ligand-receptor systems on several orphan gpcrs
by demonstrating their endogenous ligands, such as
vasopressin  xxxg230xxx  [8], leukotriene b4 blt2
receptor [9], cysteinyl leukotriene cyslt2 receptor [10],
histamine  xxxg1081xxx  [11], adp p2 tac receptor [12],
and prokineticin pk-r receptors [13]. in line with
this course of research, we managed to identify an

endogenous receptor for  xxxd2715xxx , which is a gi/ocoupled receptor expressing in the adipose tissue.

materials and methods
materials and cell.  xxxd2715xxx ,  xxxd2388xxx 
( xxxd2388xxx ), pertussis toxin (ptx), and guanosine 50 -(c-thio)triphosphate
(gtpcs) were purchased from sigma.  xxxd1742xxx  was obtained from
wako. [35 s]gtpcs (1250 ci/mmol) and [5,6-3 h] xxxd2715xxx  (50 ci/
mmol) were purchased from perkin–elmer and american radiolabeled
chemicals, respectively. acipimox [1] was synthesized by chemists in
yamanouchi pharmaceutical. 293ebna cells were purchased from
invitrogen.
cloning of human, murine, and rat hm74b. during our attempt to
amplify a transcriptional open reading frame (orf) of  xxxg1027xxx  [14]
from human spleen cdna (clontech), one novelly predicted gpcr
was found. since its predicted amino acid sequence is very similar to
that of  xxxg1027xxx , we termed this gpcr as hm74b (hhm74b). the
transcriptional orf of hm74b was ampliﬁed using the following
xbai restriction-site-containing primers: 50 -ggtctagaatgaa
tcggcaccatct-30 and 50 -ggtctagattaaggagaggtt
gggc-30 . this ampliﬁed product was subcloned into the mammalian
expression vector pef-bos (pef-h.hm74b) [15]. tblastn search
provided that an ortholog to human  xxxg1027xxx  and hm74b corresponds
to mus musculus puma-g gene [16], which we termed mhm74b.
homology-based pcr cloning using rat spleen cdna as template
provided the rat hm74b, which we termed rhm74b. the orfs of
mhm74b and rhm74b cdnas were ampliﬁed and subcloned into
pef-bos. pef-hhm74b, and pcdna3.1/zeo (invitrogen) were cotransfected into 293ebna cells. 293ebna cells stably expressing
hhm74b were established by resistance to 80 lg/ml zeocin.
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) analysis. polyðaþþ rnas from various human, murine, and rat tissues were
purchased (clontech and biochain) and cdnas were synthesized as
described previously [17]. one microliter of ﬁrst-strand cdna from
this cdna panel was used as a template for pcr. speciﬁc primers for
human  xxxg1027xxx  (sense 50 -atctgcctgccgttcg-30 , antisense 50 atggcaaacatgaagagcac-30 ), human hm74b (sense 50 catctgcctgcccttcc-30 , antisense 50 -tcatagccaacatg
aagagcat-30 ), and murine and rat hm74b (sense 50 -ttgacgg
acaactatgtcca-30 , antisense 50 -ctgtccatctgtctctgc
ct-30 ) were used to amplify the fragments of hhm74, hhm74b,
mhm74b, and rhm74b, respectively. human, murine, and rat
g3pdh mrna was also ampliﬁed as an internal control. the pcr
was performed for 30 cycles (hhm74 and hhm74b: 94 °c, 15 s and
69 °c, 60 s; mhm74b and rhm74b: 94 °c, 15 s and 60 °c, 60 s; and
hg3pdh, mg3pdh, and rg3pdh: 94 °c, 15 s and 55 °c, 60 s) with
pyrobest dna polymerase (takara), and the ampliﬁed products were
detected by ethidium-bromide staining.
assay for inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated intracellular accumulation of camp. 293ebna cells stably expressing hhm74b were plated
in 96-well plates at 5  103 cells/well and incubated for 36 h. the cells
were washed in dmem containing 1 mm  xxxd2388xxx . cells were treated
with appropriate ligands and 1 lm  xxxd1742xxx . after incubation for
15 min, the cells were harvested with 0.2% triton x-100 in phosphatebuﬀered saline. intracellular camp was measured using with a camp
homogeneous time-resolved ﬂuorescence kit (sheering). for pertussis
toxin sensitivity, cells were pretreated for 24 h with 100 ng/ml pertussis
toxin. the data were analyzed using prism (graphpad software).
[35 s]gtpcs binding assay. membranes were prepared from
293ebna cells transiently expressing hhm74b, mhm74b, or rhm74b
for use in radioligand and [35 s]gtpcs binding studies. pef-boshhm74b, pef-bos-mhm74b, or pef-bos-rhm74b was transfected
into 293ebna cells and incubated for 36 h. the cells were harvested and
the membranes were prepared as described previously [10]. five micro-

365

gram of membranes was incubated in 96-well plates with test compounds
in 200 ll of assay buﬀer containing 20 mm tris–hcl (ph 7.4), 100 mm
nacl, 10 mm mgcl2 , 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx , 5 lm gdp, and
250 pm [35 s]gtpcs (1250 ci/mmol). after a 60 min incubation at room
temperature, membranes were harvested on gf/b ﬁlter plates and
bound radionuclides were measured using topcount (packard). the
data were analyzed using prism.
radioligand binding assay. twenty lg of membranes was incubated
with several concentrations (0.5–200 nm) of [5,6-3 h] xxxd2715xxx 
(50 ci/mmol) for 2 h at room temperature in assay buﬀer (50 mm tris–
hcl (ph 7.4), 1 mm mgcl2 , and 0.02% chaps). after incubation, the
reaction was terminated by collecting the membranes onto gf/b ﬁlter,
followed by washing three times with ice-cold assay buﬀer. the radioactivity retained on each ﬁlter was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. the  xxxd2715xxx -speciﬁc binding was calculated by
subtracting the nonspeciﬁc binding which was deﬁned with 400 lm
unlabeled  xxxd2715xxx . speciﬁc binding of [3 h] xxxd2715xxx  for
hm74b-expressing membranes accounted for 80–90% of total binding.
for the competition studies, 10 nm [3 h] xxxd2715xxx  was added to
aliquots of hm74b membrane preparation, which were then incubated
with one of the several concentrations of compounds. the data were
analyzed using prism.

 xxxd2715xxx  inhibited  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated intracellular camp accumulation in human hm74b
(hhm74b) stably expressing cells in a dose-dependent

proﬁle to that of  xxxd2715xxx , also inhibited camp
accumulation in a similar fashion (fig. 1). the values of
ec50 of  xxxd2715xxx  and acipimox were 128  18 and

camp concentrations in the presence of  xxxd2388xxx  with or without  xxxd1742xxx  (1 lm) were normalized to 0% and 100%, respectively. the eﬀect
of pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml, 24 h) on camp inhibition by nicotinic
acid (s) and acipimox (m) in hhm74b-expressing 293ebna cells was
also measured. the data represent means  se in n ¼ 4. this graph

4350  937 nm, respectively. they did not aﬀect parent
cells on camp accumulation (data not shown). the
activity of adenylyl cyclase inhibition of hhm74b by
 xxxd2715xxx  or acipimox was completely blocked
by 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin (fig. 1). these results
clearly demonstrated that hhm74b is an endogenous
receptor for  xxxd2715xxx  involving gi/o-activation.
[35 s]gtpcs binding study and [3 h ] xxxd2715xxx  binding study of human, murine, and rat hm74b
blastn search provided that an ortholog to human hm74b corresponds to a mus musculus puma-g

gene, which we termed mhm74b [16]. a homologybased pcr cloning identiﬁed a rat counterpart, termed
rhm74b (fig. 2). human hm74b was 82% and 83%
identical to murine and rat hm74b, respectively, and
mhm74b was 95% identical to rhm74b. to examine
whether rodent hm74bs react to  xxxd2715xxx  and
acipimox, [35 s]gtpcs binding activity was measured.
human, murine, and rat hm74b responded to  xxxd2715xxx  and acipimox in a dose-dependent manner
(figs. 3a–c). as shown in table 1, the ec50 values of
 xxxd2715xxx  were almost the same among human and
rodent (hhm74b, 61:8  9:16 nm; mhm74b, 40:7
10:9 nm; and rhm74b, 74:9  6:20 nm). interestingly,
the ec50 ratio (acipimox/ xxxd2715xxx ) between human and rodent hm74b was diﬀerent. the ratio of
hhm74b is 42, on the other hand, that of mhm74b
and rhm74b was 8.4 and 12, respectively. these results
indicated that acipimox is more potent to rodent
hm74b than the human counterpart.
in radioligand binding study, [3 h] xxxd2715xxx 
speciﬁcally bound to human, murine or rat hm74bexpressing 293ebna cell membranes. there was no
speciﬁc binding observed for parental 293ebna cells
(data not shown). as summarized in table 1, kd values
of  xxxd2715xxx  were almost the same among the three
species (hhm74b, 63:1  3:89 nm; mhm74b, 45:3
2:33 nm; and rhm74b, 60:8  11:2 nm). ki values were
also analyzed to study the aﬃnity order of nicotinic
acid and acipimox to each hm74b by competitive
binding assay (figs. 3d–f). in consistent with the result obtained with the gtpcs binding study, the
analysis of ki values indicated that acipimox is more
potent to rodent hm74bs than the human counterpart
(table 1).
despite human  xxxg1027xxx  being closely similar to
hm74b (fig. 2),  xxxd2715xxx  (up to 100 lm) and
acipimox (up to 1 mm) showed no signiﬁcant agonistic
activity at human  xxxg1027xxx  in gtpcs binding assay (data
not shown). and also in the radioligand binding assay,
the speciﬁc binding for  xxxd2715xxx  (up to 200 nm) was
not detected (data not shown).

(tm1-7) are underlined. the accession nos. in genbank of human,
murine, hm74b, and human  xxxg1027xxx  are ab083632, nm_030701, and

have been submitted to the ddbj, embl, and genbank nucleotide
sequence database as accession nos., ab103062.

tissue distribution of human  xxxg1027xxx  and hm74b of
the three species mrna was studied by rt-pcr analysis. because the homology between  xxxg1027xxx  and hm74b
is extremely high in human, the primer set and the condition of pcr were conﬁrmed using each cloned cdna
as template in order to discriminate between these two
transcripts (data not shown). the expression of hhm74b
was detected in the adipose, lung, trachea, and spleen, on
the other hand, that of hhm74 was detected in the lung,
spleen, pbl, and adipose (fig. 4a). in murine and rat
tissues, the expression of hm74b was also detectable in
the adipose, lung, and spleen (figs. 4b and c). these

discussion
this paper describes molecular identiﬁcation and
characterization of human, murine, and rat nicotinic
acid receptors, designated hm74b. when the orf of
 xxxg1027xxx  was ampliﬁed from human spleen cdna as
template, one closely similar gpcr was found, so we
termed hm74b. genbank-analysis revealed that these

two receptors co-localized tandemly in the chromosome
12q24.31. blastn search provided the m. musculus
puma-g gene as an ortholog to human  xxxg1027xxx  and
hm74b, and homology-based pcr cloning identiﬁed
rat counterpart (fig. 2). our extensive search through
genomic pcr and genomic database analysis failed to
obtain a rodent second ortholog of human  xxxg1027xxx  and
hm74b. this suggests that  xxxg1027xxx  and hm74b may be
generated by a gene-duplication relatively recent in the
process of molecular evolution. in spite of the high sequence homology,  xxxg1027xxx  could not be activated by
 xxxd2715xxx  (up to 100 lm) or acipimox (up to 1 mm)

fig. 4. tissue distribution of hm74b mrna in human, murine, and rat tissues, by rt-pcr. ampliﬁcation with each gene-speciﬁc primer set for
human  xxxg1027xxx  (a, top panel), human hm74b (a, middle panel), murine hm74b (b, top panel), and rat hm74b (c, top panel) is shown. g3pdh is
also shown in each bottom panel as internal control.

in the gtpcs binding assay, and also the speciﬁc
binding of [3 h] xxxd2715xxx  was not detected for
 xxxg1027xxx -expressing membrane (data not shown). in view
of a previous report on the agonistic activity of nicotinic
acid [6], our results indicate that  xxxg1027xxx  has little or no
function as a  xxxg1026xxx  in human.
 xxxd2715xxx  and its analog, acipimox, are believed
to act on a gi-protein-coupled receptor on the adipocytes [3,6]. in our present study,  xxxd2715xxx  and
acipimox inhibited  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated intracellular
accumulation of camp in hhm74b stably expressing
cells in a dose-dependent manner. the activity of adenylyl cyclase inhibition of hhm74b was sensitive to
pertussis toxin (fig. 1). these data indicate that hm74b
is a gi/o-protein-coupled receptor for  xxxd2715xxx  and
the potency of  xxxd2715xxx  is in agreement with that of
the previous report [6].
the expression of hm74b in the adipose, spleen,
and lung was observed commonly among human,
mouse, and rat. our current expression proﬁle data are
consistent with the past ﬁnding that the pharmacological binding sites for  xxxd2715xxx  exist in the
spleen and the adipose tissue in rat [6]. since mhm74b
(puma-g) was reported to be an interferon-c-induc-

ible gene in the macrophages [16], the expression of
hm74b in the lung may be derived from alveolar
macrophages.
 xxxd2715xxx  and acipimox speciﬁcally bound to
human, murine, and rat hm74b-expressing membrane,
and also activated gtpcs binding in a dose-dependent
manner (fig. 3). it is interesting to note that the kd , ki ,
and ec50 values of  xxxd2715xxx  were approximately
equivalent among the three species, however, the ki and
ec50 values of acipimox were diﬀerent. the ratio
(acipimox/ xxxd2715xxx ) of human:murine:rat hm74b
was about 40:9:13 (table 1). acipimox was discovered as
an eﬀective antilipolytic agent by performing rat in vivo
screening [1]. in actual clinical situations, hyperlipidemic
patients must take high dosage, which usually deteriorates patientsõ compliance. the diﬀerence of ratio between the species suggests that an improved drug, which
can be used clinically at a less dosage, will be possibly
discovered by using human hm74b as a target molecule.
during the preparation of this article, two other researchers reported on line articles for identiﬁcation of
receptor for  xxxd2715xxx , which was identical to our
current report [18,19]. the relative potencies of nicotinic
acid and acipimox are similar, but we further conﬁrmed

t. soga et al. / biochemical and biophysical research communications 303 (2003) 364–369

the pharmacological characterization about ligand
binding study and gtpcs binding study comparing
among human, murine, and rat receptors.
in conclusion, we reported the molecular identiﬁcation and characterization of human, murine, and rat
receptors for antihyperlipidemic drug,  xxxd2715xxx . we
expect that this ﬁnding would facilitate the development
of improved drugs for hyperlipidemia.
