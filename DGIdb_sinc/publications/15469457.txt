 xxxd3349xxx  (torecanò) is a piperazine phenothiazine employed to relieve vertigo.
its use may be associated with extrapyramidal side eﬀects (dystonia, akathisia, tardive
dyskinesia) (sulkava, 1984), but parkinsonism has rarely been described. we describe
a woman who, 1 month after the onset of  xxxd3349xxx  treatment, developed
parkinsonism that disappeared 2 months after withdrawal of the drug. however,
cerebral single-photon emission computed tomography (spect) with the dopamine
(da) d2 receptors ligand 123i-iodobenzamide (123i-ibzm) revealed a persistent
reduced da d2 receptors activity (by 45%) in the basal ganglia (bg), which may
be clinically not eﬀective.

case report
a 47-year-old woman complained of sudden vertigo
due to vestibular dysfunction. cerebral computed
tomography (ct) scan was normal. symptoms rapidly recovered after treatment with  xxxd3349xxx 
20 mg/day, but she continued on the drug also after
discharge. one month later, she presented with severe
bradykinesia, rigidity, hypophonia, facial hypomimia,
and mild postural tremor.  xxxd3349xxx  was
withdrawn and in a few weeks her gait was back to
normal, with only a slightly reduced swing of the
arms; bradykinesia and tremor disappeared. two
months after drug discontinuation, the patient
underwent cerebral spect scan with 123i-ibzm
(brucke et al., 1991) (fig. 1): speciﬁc d2 receptors
binding within the bg regions (bg/cerebellar tracer
activity ratio) was 1.36 on the left, and 1.38 on the
right hemisphere. these ﬁndings, compared with
mean bg activity from nine age-matched controls
(1.68 ± 0.09), indicated a long-lasting post-synaptic
 xxxg656xxx  blockade (z-score: )3.556 and )3.333, for
left and right bg, respectively; p < 0.01).

possibility seems unlikely. the patient presented bilateral rigid-akinetic symptoms, diﬀerent from the typical
asymmetric clinical onset of pd. moreover, the 123iibzm spect indicated a bilateral long-lasting reduced
bg activity. on the contrary, in early pd, striatal d2
receptors number is unchanged or slightly increased
(antonini et al., 1997; brucke et al., 2000). reduced
bg  xxxg656xxx  activity has been found only in the
advanced stages of the disease, when an altered therapeutic response is clinically relevant (pizzolato et al.,
1993).
at the time of the 123i-ibzm spect, we found a bg
d2 receptors occupancy level of about 45%. this is, to
our knowledge, the ﬁrst in vivo demonstration of d2

comment
the time relationship between  xxxd3349xxx  treatment and onset of symptoms, along with the clinical
improvement after drug discontinuation, strongly support an iatrogenic parkinsonism. although a preclinical
idiopathic parkinson’s disease (pd) unmasked by the
use of  xxxd3349xxx  cannot be ruled out, this

receptors blockade by  xxxd3349xxx  in humans, in
agreement with the known antagonistic action of neuroleptics on da receptors (farde et al., 1992). the
observation of a persistent d2 receptors blockade
2 months after drug discontinuation is consistent with
the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd3349xxx ,
whose metabolites can be detected in body ﬂuids for
some months after the drug has been discontinued
(hardman et al., 2001). pathological and neuroimaging
studies suggested that parkinsonism occurs with d2
receptors occupancy level of at least 60–70% (knable
et al., 1997) and, therefore, it appears that a 45%
reduction of receptor activity may not be clinically
eﬀective when the presynaptic nigro-striatal pathway is
functionally unaﬀected.
