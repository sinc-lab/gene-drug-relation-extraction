synopsis:  xxxd236xxx ' is an hrhistamine receptor antagonist with a long duration of
action permitting oncedaily administration. its efficacy in seasonal and perennial allergic
rhinitis has beenconvincingly demonstrated, and several comparative studiessuggest that
 xxxd236xxx  is at least as effective as some other hrhistamine receptor antagonists. a few
smaller studies have shown beneficial effects on the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis
and chronic urticaria (but not atopic dermatitis). while astemizoleappears to share with
otherhi-histamine receptor antagonists a tendencyto increase appetite and cause weight
gain after prolonged use, it offers the important advantage of an absence of significant
central nervous system depression or anticholinergic effects with usualdoses. thus, astemizoleoffers a worthwhile improvement in side effect profileover 'traditional' hi-histamine
receptor antagonists, especially in patientsbothered by the sedative effects ofthese drugs.
pharmacodynamic properties: because of difficulties associated with the assay procedures, the h i-histamine receptor binding profile of  xxxd236xxx  in vitro remains unclear .
however, a striking finding in such studies was the extremely slow dissociation of
 xxxd236xxx  from hi-histamine receptors. in vivo (guinea-pigs)  xxxd236xxx  occupied h i histamine receptors in the lung at very low doses while severalfold greater doses were
required to achieve equivalent occupancy of cerebellum receptors ; the duration of occupancy was several days. while  xxxd236xxx  showed some affinity for serotonergic ana
aq-adrenergic receptors in vitro, it was devoid of activity on dopaminergic and muscarinic
receptors. in vivo (rats)  xxxd236xxx  demonstrated little antiserotonergic activity and no
anticholinergic activity. in healthy volunteers salivary flow rates after a 40mg dose of
 xxxd236xxx  were no different from placebo values.
in human volunteers , single doses of  xxxd236xxx  (40mg) significantly inhibited the
weal and flare response to intradermal histamine. long term administration (up to 3
months) to volunteers and patients with chronic urticaria increased the maximum inhibitory effect on the histamine response and did not result in tachyphylaxis. results of
studies in animals and human volunteers suggested a similar degree of activity in allergen-mediated reactions.  xxxd236xxx  did not exert any consistent effect on mast cell mediator storage and release.
the central nervous system depressant activity of  xxxd236xxx  has been assessed in
volunteers by several psychomotor performance, reactivity and sedation tests. these studies
showed no significant central nervous system depression following administration of
 xxxd236xxx  (doses ranged between \0 and 60mg), while sustained release tripolidine iomg,
ketotifen img or chlorpheniramine 16mg often produced significant changes in such tests.
additionally,  xxxd236xxx  did not potentiate the central effects of either alcohol or diazepam \omg.

pharmacokinetics: following oral administration,  xxxd236xxx  appeared to undergo extensive first-pass metabolism. maximum plasma concentrations of  xxxd236xxx  and metabolites occurred 1 to 4 hours after single oral doses (10 to 4omg) and generally varied
with dose. administration of the drug with food significantly decreased bioavailability.
with multiple-dose administration (lomg daily), steady-state plasma concentrations of
unchanged drug were attained within 1 to 2 weeks, after which no further drug accumulation occurred.
in dogs,  xxxd236xxx  and its active metabolite, desmethylastemizole, were distributed
to the pancreas, adrenals, liver, lungs, salivary glands, kidney tissue and the testes in
concentrations greater than 400 times the concomitant plasma concentration. the drug
and/or its metabolites were found in the milk of lactating dogs and to a limited extent
in the placenta of pregnant rats.  xxxd236xxx  was 96.7% bound to plasma proteins in
human volunteers. plasma concentrations in terminal renal failure patients were not decreased by dialysis.
in healthy volunteers,  xxxd236xxx  was rapidly and extensively metabolised to several
active and inactive metabolites. excretion of the metabolised drug was slow and was
mainly via the faeces (54 to 73% of an administered dose was excreted in the faeces
within 14 days). after long term administration of iomg daily to volunteers and patients,
the apparent elimination half-life of the drug and metabolites was 18 to 20 days.
therapeutic trials: in published and unpublished double -blind trials of seasonal and
perennial allergic rhinitis,  xxxd236xxx  (usual dosage 30mg daily for 2 to 3 days followed
by lomg once daily for up to 12 weeks) was significantly superior to placebo at achieving
'excellent' to 'good' symptom control as measured by global assessments by patients and
investigators. additionaily, the use of 'backup' antihistamines was less frequent among
 xxxd236xxx -treated patients, and in many of the studies the  xxxd236xxx  group exhibited
significantly less severe daily and mean nasal and ocular symptoms (as recorded in patient
diaries and on visual analogue scales).  xxxd236xxx  appeared to be at least as effective as
clemastine and several other hj-histamine receptor antagonists in alleviating the symptoms of rhinitis. in a single study  xxxd236xxx  was more effective than terfenadine in
patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, although some puzzling findings of the study suggest it should be interpreted cautiously.
in a double-blind comparison,  xxxd236xxx  therapy (30mg daily for up to 7 days and
then lomg daily) for 2 weeks was significantly superior to placebo in relieving the symptoms of ailergic conjunctivitis. global assessments, both by investigators and patients,
rated treatment results 'excellent' to 'good' in a greater percentage of  xxxd236xxx -treated
patients than placebo patients. in another double-blind comparison there was no significant difference between  xxxd236xxx  iomg daily and  xxxd2572xxx  5mg twice daily after
2 weeks' therapy. however, following 6 weeks' therapy  xxxd236xxx  had alleviated 2 of
the 5 measured symptoms significantly more so than  xxxd2572xxx , and the investigator
rated the results 'good' to 'excellent' in significantly more  xxxd236xxx -treated patients.
when assessed subject ively on a linear analogue scale and objectively as nocturnal
scratching, there was no significant difference in the magnitude of pre- and post-treatment
( xxxd236xxx  lomg) itch and scratching in patients suffering from atopic eczema. similarly,
in an unpublished double-blind comparison, the efficacy of  xxxd236xxx  iomg daily in
relieving the symptoms of atopic dermatitis did not differ statistically from that of placebo. in contrast, xxxd236xxx  iomg daily or 30mg daily for up to 1 week, then 10mg daily
for 3 more weeks, was significantly more effective than placebo in relieving the symptoms
of chronic urticaria (double-blind comparisons).
side effects: the cumulation of side effect data from over 700  xxxd236xxx -treated
patients resulted in incidences of central nervous system depression and dry mouth that
were little different from those reported during placebo administration. however, asternizole may share with other hj-histamine receptor antagonists the tendency to promote
increased appetite and weight gain after prolonged use.

dosage and administration: the recommended adult dosage is iomgonce daily taken
on an empty stomach. in some countries up to 30mg once daily may be given for up to
7 days (then iomg daily) when symptoms are severe. this dosage should be halved in
children aged 6 to 12 years. for younger children the dose is determined on a weight
basis with the suspension formulation: iml (2mg)/iokg bodyweight daily.

1. pharmacodynamic studies
 xxxd236xxx  (fig. 1) is a long acting hj-histamine
receptor antagonist having no chemical relationship to known drugs. the markedly lesser binding
of  xxxd236xxx  to cerebellum hi-histamine receptors than to lung hi-histamine receptors when administered in low doses to guinea-pigs may explain
the lack of central effects such as sedation and decreased psychomotor performance during administration to human volunteers.
1.1 receptor binding characteristics
the hi-histamine receptor binding affinity of
 xxxd236xxx  in vitro remains unclear and . caution
must be used in interpreting in vitro studies of the
receptor profile of the drug. however, in vivo experiments in guinea-pigs showed that hj-histamine receptors in the lung were occupied at very
low doses, while severalfold greater doses were required to achieve equivalent occupancy of cerebellum receptors (presumably because of poor
penetration of the blood-brain barrier).
 xxxd236xxx  also demonstrated some binding affinity in vitro for ai-adrenergic receptors and sr
serotonergic receptors, but not dopaminergic or
muscarinic receptors.

1.1.1 hi-histamine receptors
difficulties, including a high affinity for nonspecific binding sites and problems in preparing
standard solutions of 3h- xxxd236xxx , were encountered in assaying the hi-histamine receptor affinity
of  xxxd236xxx  in vitro (guinea-pig cerebellum tissue). under standard conditions the hj-histamine
receptor affinity of  xxxd236xxx  in this model was
relatively low: the concentration inhibiting the

binding of 3h- xxxd3050xxx  by 50% (icso) = 40
nmol/l, corresponding values for chlorpheniramine and promethazine were 7.7 and 6.8 nmol/l,
respectively. however, when the incubation time
and volume of the incubation were increased the
affinity of  xxxd236xxx  increased 1q-fold (4.7 nrnol/
l). the most striking property of the drug was its
extremely slow dissociation rate from hj-histamine receptors when assayed in vitro (laduron et
ai., 1982).
in vivo binding was measured in lung and cerebellum tissue from guinea-pigs administered oral
 xxxd236xxx . there was a marked difference in the
percentage occupancy in the 2 tissues (fig. 2). only
at higher doses (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) did the percentage binding in the cerebellum approach that in the
lung ("" 80%). the hj-histamine receptor blockade
declined gradually over 6 to 10 days (vs 1 day for
an equivalent blockade with  xxxd3050xxx ) . multidose administration resulted in an increase in the
percentage of receptors occupied (laduron et ai.,
1982).

1.1.2 other receptors
the  xxxd236xxx  1cso in vitro for other receptors
was as follows: 14 nmol/l for ai-adrenergic receptors (using 3h-wb-4101 in rat forebrain tissue); 80
nmol/l in s2-serotonergic receptors (using 3h-spiperone in rat frontal cortex); and > 1000 nmol/l
in dopaminergic and muscarinic receptors (using
3h-haloperidol and 3h-dexetimide, respectively, in
rat striata tissue). pretreatment of rats with orally
administered  xxxd236xxx  in doses as high as 10 mg/
kg did not prevent labelling of srserotonergic receptors in the frontal cortex or dopaminergic receptors in the striatum by 3h-spiperone (laduron
et ai., 1982).

1.2.1 animal studies
 xxxd236xxx  demonstrated high potency in vitro
at inhibiting histamine-induced contractions (mediated by hi-histamine receptors) in isolated
guinea-pig ileum [50% effective concentration
(ecso) = 0.0001 mg/l], however, much higher drug
concentrations were required to inhibit histamineinduced increases in the contraction rate of guineapig atrium (ecso > 0.63 mg/l) and in the acid secretion of rat stomach (ecso > 10.0 mg/l), both
of which are mediated by hj-histamine receptors
(awouters et ai., 1983).
a small range of median (edso) or lowest effective dose values (0.05 to 0.16 mg/kg) have been
reported for oral  xxxd236xxx  in animal models of
antihistamine activity, including histamine-induced bronchoconstriction and lethality in the
guinea-pig, and histamine-induced skin reactions
in the guinea-pig, dog and rat. additionally, an edso
of 0.11 mg/kg was reported in the compound 48/
80 lethality test in rats with both oral and subcutaneously administered  xxxd236xxx ; compound 48/
80 acts on mast cells to cause release of histamine
and serotonin (awouters et al., 1981, 1983; niemegeers et ai., 1982, 1984; schuurkes and van
nueten, 1983; van wauwe et al., 1981). the duration of action of  xxxd236xxx  was considerably
longer than that of any other reference antihistamine tested: at 3 times its lowest oral edso  xxxd236xxx  protected against 48/80-induced lethal shock
for 24 hours, whereas protection by other drugs
lasted between 3 and 8 hours (awouters et al., 1983;
niemegeers et ai., 1984).
1.2.2 human studies
a standard method to study hi-histamine receptor antagonists in humans is to evaluate their
ability to inhibit the skin reaction to intradermally
injected histamine. in male volunteers , the mean
maximal inhibition in the flare response to histamine 5~g following a single dose of  xxxd236xxx 
varied from 25% (l rng) to 89% (40mg) and was
clearly dose related, as was the time to mean peak
effect and the duration of a significant inhibitory

histamine in asthmatic patients.

effect (32 days for the 40mg dose). the effect of
 xxxd236xxx  on the weal reaction was less pronounced in this study (brugmans et ai., 1982).
however, in a second study (bateman et ai., 1983a;
bateman and rawlins, 1984) the half-life of both
weal and flare disappearance following challenge
with histamine 2 to 60~ was significantly (p < 0.05)
decreased 24 and 48 hours after a single 40mg
 xxxd236xxx  dose.  xxxd236xxx  appeared to be a more
potent and longer acting inhibitor of weal and flare
than chlorpheniramine 16mg, however the significance of this difference was not reported (bateman
and rawlins, 1984). weal and flare responses were
also inhibited by long term  xxxd236xxx  therapy, both
in healthy volunteers (lomg daily for 20 days)
[brugmans et ai., 1982; fig. 3] and in patients with
chronic urticaria (mean maximum dose of 15mg
daily for 3 months) [bateman et ai., 1983a; bateman and rawlins, 1984] with no evidence of
tachyphylaxis. in patients with pruritus only the
weal response was consistently inhibited to a significant degree (p < 0.02) during long term therapy
(mean maximum dose of 15mg daily for 3 months)

an  xxxd236xxx  edso of 0.7 p.g/l was reported
for the inhibition of serotonin (5-ht)-induced increases in vascular permeability in the isolated rat
caudal artery (awouters et ai., 1983). in vivo (rats)
the edso for inhibition of serotonin-induced skin
reactions was i42-fold greater than the edso in the
compound 48/80 lethality test (antihistamine activity; section 1.2.1) [awouters et ai., 1981; niemegeers et ai., 1982; van wauwe et ai., 1981].
the edso of  xxxd236xxx  in tests of anticholinergic activity in rats (capacity to induce mydriasis
and to increase survival following a lethal dose of
physostigmine) was greater than the highest tested
dose (160 mg/kg) [niemegeers et al., 1982; van
wauwe et ai., 1981]. in healthy volunteers, salivary
flow rates were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) 4

and 8 hours after chlorpheniramine 16mg was administered orally, but after  xxxd236xxx  40mg salivary flow rates did not differ from placebo values
(bateman and rawlins, 1984).
1.4 antiallergic activity
 xxxd236xxx  was active in several animal models
of allergy including: passive peritoneal anaphylaxis
in the rat; lethal anaphylactic shock in the guineapig; ascaris allergen-induced skin reaction in the
dog; trichinella spiralis-induced anaphylactic shock
in the mouse; and local (pinna) anaphylaxis in the
mouse (median or lowest effective doses ranging
from 0.05 to 0.16 mg/kg) ,  xxxd236xxx  was administered orally in all of the above models except the
last, in which subcutaneous administration was assessed. two additional allergic reactions (anaphylatoxin-induced skin reaction in the guinea-pig and
passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in the rat) were less
completely inhibited, in the latter presumably because of the contribution of serotonin to the anaphylaxis (awouters et al., 1981, 1983; van wauwe
et al., 1981).
in atopic patients, astem izole 10mg daily significantly inhibited the skin responses to intradermal injections of house dust mite extract, animal dander extract (challenge after 10 days' therapy;
vanderschueren et al., unpublished) and grass pollen extract (challenge after 8 weeks' therapy; howarth et al., 1984). additionally, the nasal reactions to house dust mite extract or pollen extract
challenge were inhibited as effectively by  xxxd236xxx  10mg daily as by topical sodium eromoglycate
2%(for up to 24 hours after the challenge) [pelikan,
unpublished; van cauwenberge, 1984].  xxxd236xxx 
also inhibited the bronchoconstrlctive reactions to
house dust mite extract in atopic asthmatic patients
(challenge after 10 days' therapy) [vanderschueren
et al., unpublished].
1.5 mast cell mediator storage and release
some other hi-histamine receptor antagonists
have demonstrated a bell-shaped concentration/response curve for effects on histamine release from

44

in vitro models of human mast cells, a reflection
of the inhibition of mediator-induced histamine release at lower drug doses and (both in the presence
and absence of mediator substances) stimulation of
histamine release by the drug at higher drug doses
(church and gradidge , 1980a,b). the clinical importance of this effect is unknown. similarly,
 xxxd236xxx  0.01 to 0.1 mrnol/l exhibited a bellshaped effect on compound 48/80- or trichinella
spi;alis-induced histam ine release from rat peritoneal mast cells. the drug also significantly (p ~
0.05) increased the spontaneous release of histamine from both sensitised and non-sensitised rat
peritoneal mast cells which were not exposed to
any other inducing substance (de clerck et al.,
1981). however, on sensitised human lung tissue
 xxxd236xxx  did not consistently reduce the allergeninduced release of histamine (awouters et al., 1983).
in vivo, repeated administration of  xxxd236xxx 
to rats did not decrease the histamine content of
peritoneal cells, or their number. also, when rats
sensitised to ovalbumin were challenged intraperitoneally, the amount of released histamine was not
affected by treatment with  xxxd236xxx  (awouters et
al, 1983).
1.6 psychomotor performance, reactivity and
sedation studies
in rodents, very high doses of  xxxd236xxx  (> ' 40
rug/kg) were devoid of activity on intracranial selfstimulation behaviour (wauquier and neimegeers ,
1981) and locomotor activity (niemegeers et al,
1982),and did not affect the intensity of the typical
effects of centrally acting drugs ( xxxd2599xxx 
sodium, ethanol, chlordiazepoxide, haloperidol,
fentanyl and tranylcypromine) [awouters et al.,
1983; niemegeers and awouters, 1984]. in dogs, 6
antihistamines ( xxxd236xxx , chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine, ketotifen,  xxxd3050xxx  and terfenadine) were compared for effects on the sleepwakefulness patterns of the eeg;  xxxd236xxx  was
the only one to exhibit no significant effects (wauquier et al., 1981, 1984).
human studies confirmed the absence of central effects with  xxxd236xxx  (table i). neither single

doses of  xxxd236xxx  10 to 30mg, nor daily therapy
for up to 2 weeks resulted in any significant difference in scores of alertness, reactivity, concentration capacity, performance, mood or well-being
as compared with scores following placebo administration. scores were also not affected by terfenadine 60mg (usual terfenadine dose is 60mg twice
daily), but both ketotifen i or 3mg and sustainedrelease tripolidine 10mg significantly decreased
scores. additionally,  xxxd236xxx  did not potentiate
the effects of alcohol or diazepam 10mg on scores.
1.7 effect on liver function
in both dogs and rats, high concentrations of
 xxxd236xxx  were found in the liver (section 2.2).

while the tissue distribution of  xxxd236xxx  has not
been studied in man, several studies have assessed
the effect of the drug on liver function.
in healthy volunteers,  xxxd236xxx  iomg daily did
not alter hepatic microsomal enzyme activity as
measured by  xxxd192xxx  clearance (after 30 days'
administration of  xxxd236xxx ) [bateman and rawlins, 1983]or as measured by ethanol kinetics (after
7 days' administration of  xxxd236xxx ) [bateman et
al., 1983b].
liver blood flow as measured by indocyanine
green kinetics was unaffected in 7 patients with
chronic urticaria or severe pruritus after 3 months'
administration of  xxxd236xxx  10mg daily. however, the reliability of indocyanine green clearance
as a measure of liver blood flow has been chal-

 xxxd236xxx : a review

lenged. also, in healthy volunteers both the volume of distribution and the clearance of indocyanine green were significantly (p < 0.02) reduced
48 hours after administration of a single 40mg dose
of  xxxd236xxx  (bateman et al., i983c).
liver function tests appear to be unaffected
by  xxxd236xxx . in a review of clinical laboratory
safety studies involving over 500  xxxd236xxx -treated
patients, no consistent changes were seen in any of
the laboratory values and no differences in changes
could be shown between  xxxd236xxx -treated patients
and controls (vanden bussche et al., 1984a).
1.8 toxicology studies
in rats, daily oral  xxxd236xxx  doses of 5 or 20
mgjkg for 3 to 18 months had no effect on mortality, behaviour and appearance, food consumption, bodyweight gain, haematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, organ weights, gross pathology or
histopathology. in dogs, daily doses of up to 10
mgjkg for 3 to 12 months resulted in little or no
toxicity. higher long term  xxxd236xxx  doses in these
species led to emaciation accompanied in some instances by macrophage accumulation or histological abnormalities of male gonads. however, only
long term doses as high as 320 mgjkg (rats) and 40
mgjkg (dogs) resulted in death due to emaciation
(awouters et al., 1983; unpublished data on file,
janssen pharmaceutica).
 xxxd236xxx  10, 40 or 160 mgjkg daily was administered orally to male rats for 60 days before
mating and to female rats from 14 days before mating through 3 weeks oflactation. additionally, rabbits were administered daily oral doses of 2.5, 10
or 40 mgjkg from day 6 to 18 of pregnancy. fertility was unaffected and there was no evidence of
dysmorphogenicity in any fetuses of either species
except abnormalities which had already been observed in control animals during previous experiments. however, in rats but not rabbits, dosages
of 40 and 160 mgjkg resulted in embryotoxicity
(decreased litter size and increased resorption rate)
which could only partially be explained by maternal toxicity (reduced food consumption and bodyweight). resorption was 100% at the 160 mgjkg
dosage level. the dose of 10 mgjkg was neither

46

embryotoxic nor maternally toxic (awouters et al.,
1983; unpublished data on file, janssen pharmaceutica).
 xxxd236xxx  demonstrated no mutagenicity effects in any of the standard tests to which it has
been subjected: sister chromatid exchange test;
ames test on salmonella typhimurium ; sex-linked
recessive lethal test in drosophila meldnogaster;
metaphase analysis test in human lymphocytes;
micronucleus test in rats; and dominant lethal toxicity test in mice (awouters et al., 1983; vanparys
et al., 1982;unpublished data on file, janssen pharmaceutica).
.
no carcinogenic potential was evident in a lifespan oral carcinogenicity study in which 400 mice
received  xxxd236xxx  doses of 5, 20 or 80 mgjkg daily
for 18 months (awouters et al., 1983; unpublished
data on file, janssen pharmaceutica).

2. pharmacokinetlc studies
most information in this section has been drawn
review by heykants (1984) and unpubfrom
lished data (on file, janssen pharmaceutica). with
the exception of information on the dialysability
of the drug (see below), no data were available on
the effects of disease states or age (children/elderly)
on the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd236xxx .
concentrations of  xxxd236xxx  and its primary
metabolite, desmethylastemizole, have been measured by high pressure liquid chromatography'
(hplc; accurate over the plasma concentration
range of 1 to 100ilgjl) [woestenborghset al., 1983].
radioimmunoassay has also been used to quantify
 xxxd236xxx  and related metabolites , including their
conjugates; extraction at ph 7.8 and radioimmunoassay measures  xxxd236xxx  and hydroxylated (active) metabolites, the major one being desmethylastemizole; and extraction at both ph 7.8
and 12 and radioimmunoassay measures unchanged  xxxd236xxx , and to a certain degree norastemizole (fig. 4). the radioimmunoassay detection
limit for  xxxd236xxx  and metabolites in plasma is
0.1 ilgjl. in the pharmacokinetic analysis of asternizole, radioimmunoassay procedures were most
frequently employed.

 xxxd236xxx  : a rev iew

2.1 absorption
following single-dose oral adm inistration of
 xxxd236xxx  10 to 40mg in healthy volunteers , peak
plasma concentrations of  xxxd236xxx  and metabolites occurred in i to 4 hours and generally were
linearly related to dose. peak concentrations of
 xxxd236xxx  plus metabolites were severalfold greater
than those of unchanged  xxxd236xxx , which indicates extensive first-pass metabolism.
the bioavailability of oral  xxxd236xxx  10mg as
a tablet and suspension (2 g/l) were compared with
an aqueous solution of the drug. there were no
statistically significant differences between these
formulations in the peak plasma concentration,
time to peak or area under the plasma concentration/time curve (avc) for either  xxxd236xxx  plus
all related metabolites or  xxxd236xxx  plus hydroxylated metabolites. however, adm inistration of a
10mg tablet with food significantly decreased the
bioavailability of  xxxd236xxx  and hydroxylated me-

tabolites (indicated by a decreased peak plasma
concentration and ave, and increased time to peak
concentrations) as compared with the bioavailability in subjects not given food.
with multidose adm inistration of  xxxd236xxx 
10mgdaily to volunteers and patients, steady-state
plasma concentrations of unchanged  xxxd236xxx 
were attained within i to 2 weeks, whereas steadystate concentrations of  xxxd236xxx  and its metabolites were not reached until 4 to 8 weeks of
administration. no further drug accumulat ion
occurred once steady-state concentrations were
attained.
2.2 distribution
the apparent volume of distribution of  xxxd236xxx  and hydroxylated metabolites derived from
plasma concentration values following administration of a 300mg dose to a volunteer was 250 l/kg.

 xxxd236xxx  : a review

antagonists have uniformly been found to be highest in the lungs, with decreasing concentrations in
liver, brain, kidneys, spleen and muscle (melville,
1973). the tissue distribution of  xxxd236xxx  has
been studied in the dog and the rat. in dogs, following 6 weeks of  xxxd236xxx  i or 10 mg/kg daily,
concentrations of unchanged  xxxd236xxx  and its active metabolite, desmethylastemizole, were greatest in pancreas, adrenal , liver, lung, salivary gland,
kidney tissue, and the testes (concentrations> 400
times the plasma concentration). lowest tissue
concentrations were found in subcutaneous fat,
skin, muscle, thymus, heart and brain. 30 minutes
after administration of 3h- xxxd236xxx  0.16 mg/kg
intravenously to rats, highest levels of radioactivity
were found in the lungs, liver, kidney and thyroid.
large amounts were also found in the intestinal
contents, which indicates biliary excretion. by 24
hours after dosing, radioactivity was significantly
decreased in the liver and gastrointestinal tract.
limited transfer of radioactivity occurred through
the placenta of pregnant rats (at peak time radioactivity offetuses and placenta accounted for < 1%
of the total dose). in lactating dogs, average milk/
plasma ratios of 4.4 and 4.6 were reported for unchanged  xxxd236xxx  and desmethylastemizole, respectively.
the plasma protein binding of  xxxd236xxx  was
96.7% in male volunteers. in terminal renal failure
patients, dialysis did not decrease the plasma concentrations of  xxxd236xxx  and its hydroxylated metabolites, probably because of their high protein
binding.
2.3 metabolism and elimination
plasma  xxxd236xxx  concentrations decayed biphasically (distribution phase and elimination
phase). in some studies the estimation of half-life
was difficult because plasma concentrations could
not be followed long enough, especially when low
doses were given. thus, the 'apparent' half-life was
calculated from the terminal part of the plasma
concentration curve. followinga single 300mg dose
in a volunteer , the apparent terminal half-life for
 xxxd236xxx  was approximately 20 hours, and for

desmethylastemizole was approximately 12 days.
after long term administration (2 weeks to 5
months) of  xxxd236xxx  iomg daily to volunteers and
patients, the apparent elimination half-life of
 xxxd236xxx  and metabolites was 18 to 20 days.
in healthy volunteers,  xxxd236xxx  was rapidly
and extensively metabolised via aromatic hydroxylation, oxidative dealkylation and glucuronidation,
the main metabolites being desmethylastemizole,
norastemizole and 6-hydroxydesmethylastemizole.
in animal models (inhibition of compound 48/80
lethality in rats and histamine lethality in guineapigs), desmethylastemizole demonstrated antihistamine potency similar to that of the parent compound.
the excretion of  xxxd236xxx  was studied in human volunteers following oral administration of
14c- xxxd236xxx  30mg. excretion was slow, amounting to only 40 to 54% of the dose at 4 days and 61
to 79% of the dose at 14 days. radioactivity was
excreted mainly in the faeces: 54 to 73%of the dose
within 14 days, with only 5.4 to 6.3% excreted in
the urine. the 3 major metabolites each accounted
for 17 to 30% of the radioactivity excreted in the
faeces, whereas the major metabolites detected in
the urine were the glucuronides of desmethylastemizole and norastemizole . unchanged  xxxd236xxx  was not recovered in the urine or faeces.

3. therapeutic trials
the therapeutic efficacy of  xxxd236xxx  in allergic
rhinitis (seasonal and perennial) and allergic conjunctivitis has been assessed in placebo-controlled
trials and compared with the efficacy of alternative
hi-histamine receptor antagonists. the drug has
also been evaluated in small, generally placebocontrolled, trials of allergic dermatological disorders.
3.1 trials in allergic rhinitis
allergic rhinitis includes both seasonal rhinitis
(hayfever) and perennial rhinitis (due to non-seasonal allergens). offending allergens in a geneti-

 xxxd236xxx  : a review

callypredisposed person can cause hypersensitivity
(jackson et al., 1980). nasal smears in patients with
perennial rhinitis contain increased numbers of
mast cells, and patients with seasonal rhinitis have
increased numbers of basophils in nasal secretions
during the pollen season (wihl, 1979). re-exposure
to antigen causes symptoms of nasal stuffiness, nasal discharge, sneezing, eye irritation with swelling,
and itching of the eyes, nose and throat (jackson
et ai.., 1980).
clinical evaluation of drugs ' for use in allergic
rhinitis may be performed by nasal provocation
tests and investigation in clinical disease. however, ordinary nasal provocation tests are often insufficiently standardised (borum, 1979) and spontaneous variations in atmospheric allergen levels
(and therefore in the intensity of symptoms, especially in seasonal rhinitis) make the design and
interpretation of clinical trials difficult. a discrete
geographic area and as close as possible to simultaneous evaluation of the treatments being compared should be used in seasonal rhinitis (brogden
et al., 1974; church, 1978). as there is no proven
objective method of measuring the severity of allergic rhinitis, subjective assessment by means of
scoring systems and patient symptom diaries is
generally used.
3.1.1 seasonal rhinitis
in unpublished and published randomised
double-blind trials oral  xxxd236xxx  has been compared with placebo and other antihistamines in
patients suffering from seasonal rhinitis (hayfever).
the most frequently assessed  xxxd236xxx  dosage was
lomgadministered once daily, but in several trials
a daily dosage of 30mg was administered for the
first few days. the duration of the trial period
ranged from 2 to 12 weeks (usually 4 to 6 weeks)
and coincided with the hayfever season. a history
of symptoms was generally confirmed by i or more
additional tests of allergic reactivity , such as skin
test, nasal provocation test, eosinophilia, serum ige
levels and radioallergosorbent test. most of the
studies excluded patients receiving treatment with
corticosteroids, other antihistamines, or other
antiallergic medications, as well as those recently

49

desensitised. however, in most of the placebo-controlled trials a 'backup' antihistamine was provided and its use was quantified as an additional
index to assess efficacy.
comparison with placebo
the activity of  xxxd236xxx  in seasonal rhinitis
patients has been compared with placebo in several
unpublished and published randomised doubleblind studies (table ii). in most of these studies the
overall efficacyin alleviating symptoms (global assessment) was rated by patients and/or investigators: good or excellent results were reported in 50
to 100% of  xxxd236xxx  patients versus 6 to 47% of
placebo recipients (a statistically significant difference in most instances). also, additional antihistamine use, as measured by the number of patients
requiring medication or the number of doses consumed, generally tended to be lower among the
 xxxd236xxx  groups than the placebo groups, significantly so on many of the study days or overall.
despite the likely obscuring of real differences in
effect between  xxxd236xxx  and placebo by the use
of a 'backup' antihistamine, the superiority of
 xxxd236xxx  was demonstrated against most nasal
( xxxd236xxx  was usually significantly effective in alleviating runny nose and sneezing, but not nasal
obstruction) and ocular symptoms.
while in these studies the drug did not prove
effective against respiratory symptoms such as difficult breathing, and showed no effect on respiratory function tests, evidence in a small number of
children suggeststhat administration of  xxxd236xxx 
may improve the difficult breathing and coughing
associated with some paediatric allergic disorders
(e.g. seasonal rhinitis and allergic bronchitis)
[deloore, unpublished] .
in an attempt to control the effect of atmospheric allergen variations, several of the above
studies compared daily symptom severity scores
between the groups and/or monitored pollen
counts. daily symptom severity scores among
 xxxd236xxx -treated patients were generally lower
(less severe) than those of placebo patients, the difference being statistically significant on 25 to 65%
of the treatment days.

comparison with other antihistamines
(table iii)
several studies have compared oral  xxxd236xxx 
10mg once daily with oral clemastine img twice
daily or 1mg administered in the morning and 2mg
in the evening. all of these studies were randomised and all but i were double-blind comparisons.
when global assessments were compared, there
were no statistically significant differences between
the percentage of patients achieving 'excellent' to
'good' symptom control with either drug. similarly, on most treatment days both drugs significantly decreased symptom severity scores as compared with pretreatment scores, and there was no
difference in efficacy between the drugs. however,
in most of these studies  xxxd236xxx  tended to cause
sedation in less patients than clemastine, and this
difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05)
in 2 studies (horak, unpublished; moller and
johansson, 1984).
 xxxd236xxx  10mgdaily alleviated symptoms significantly more effectively than sustained release
 xxxd2906xxx  75mg daily (wood, 1984). however,
when malmberg et al. (1983) compared the efficacy
ofastemizole 10 mg/day with  xxxd2906xxx  75 mgf
day and with placebo in patients with seasonal
rhinitis during the birch pollen season in finland,
there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) between the mean weekly nasal symptom scores of
the 3 groups only during the first week of pollination (fig. 5). eye symptom scores did not differ
significantly.
 xxxd236xxx  10 mg,/day was not significantly different from  xxxd1763xxx  nasal spray and
eyedrops used prophylactically (flowers, 1984), was
similar in efficacy to oral  xxxd2572xxx  5mg twice
daily, and was at least as effective as oral ketotifen
lrng twice daily. the use of a 'loading dose'
( xxxd236xxx  30 mg,/day for i week followed by 10
rug/day, or ketotifen 4 mg,/day for i week followed
by 2 mg,/day) generally resulted in similar efficacy
to  xxxd236xxx  10 rug/day (no 'loading dose'). in the
only comparative study with another antihistamine claimed to be non-sedating,  xxxd236xxx  was
significantly more effective than either terfenadine
or placebo in alleviating itching eyes, sneezing and

runny nose. however, 20 to 30% of the patients in
each group dropped out because of a lack of symptom relief, and the puzzling finding that placebo
was also significantly more effective than terfenadine suggests that these results must be interpreted
with caution (howarth and holgate, 1984).
combined global evaluation scores from over
300 hayfever patients treated with  xxxd236xxx 
showed a trend to greater efficacy with the use of
a 'loading dose' , perhaps due to a faster relief of
the symptoms (the percentage of patients with
marked symptom scores appeared to decrease faster
with daily 20 to 30mg doses than with daily iomg
doses on the first 3 days of treatment). however,
this difference did not reach statistical significance
(vanden bussche, 1984a).

paediatric studies
the efficacy of  xxxd236xxx  in children with seasonal rhinitis has been demonstrated by deloore
(unpublished) and moller and johansson (1984)
[see above]. vanden bussche et al. (1984a) reviewed the data available on paediatric patients
treated with  xxxd236xxx  (57 patients with allergic
rhinitis and 18 with allergic conjunctivitis). of the
51 patients for whom global evaluations were
available, 69%were reported to have obtained good
to excellent results.
3.1.2 perennial rhinitis
 xxxd236xxx  10 mgjday, has been compared with
placebo, clemastine, and chlorpheniramine in the
treatment of non-allergic (mygind et al., 1984) and
allergic perennial rhinitis (table iv). the diagnosis
was confirmed by history and i or more additional
tests of allergic reactivity (see section 3.1.1). many
of the allergic patients suffered from additional allergic disorders (i.e. asthma, eczema or urticaria)
and several had a history of treatment with alternative antihistamines. generally, treatment groups
were reported to be comparable in age, sex, weight,
duration of illness, and severity of symptoms.
in comparative double-blind trials, both patients
and investigators rated symptomatic improvement
'good' to 'excellent' in significantly more  xxxd236xxx -treated patients than placebo patients. also,

 xxxd236xxx  : a review

 xxxd236xxx  was more effective than placebo at decreasing the severity of nasal symptoms and the
time that nasal and ocular symptoms were present.
vanden busscheet al. (1982) reported that 'backup'
diphenhydramine was used by fewer  xxxd236xxx 
than placebo patients on each of the 28 days.
in a small number of patients , the symptomatic
improvement experienced with  xxxd236xxx  10 rng/
day appeared similar to that of chlorpheniramine
4mg thrice daily and superior to that of clemastine
lrng twice daily. additionally, global assessments
rated  xxxd236xxx  significantly superior to both
comparison drugs. confirmation of these results in
a larger number of patients will be awaited with
interest.
the combined results from over 100 patients
treated with  xxxd236xxx  in several comparative trials
(vanden bussche et al., i984a; data on file, janssen
pharmaceut ica) indicate that the use of a 'loading
dose' of 20 or 30mg daily for the first few days of
treatment significantly improved the patients', but

not the investigators', perception of the drug's efficacy in perennial rhinitis (global assessment) .
3.2 trials in allergic conjunctivitis
the efficacy of  xxxd236xxx  has been compared
in double-blind studies with that of placebo and
 xxxd2572xxx  in a small number of patients with
acute or chronic conjunctivitis. most of the patients
also suffered from additional allergic disorders (i.e.
asthma , rhinitis , urticaria) and many had received
previous therapy for their conjunctivitis (i.e. anti histamines, topical steroids), some with only moderate success. in both studies the treatment groups
were reported to be comparable in age, sex, severity of symptoms and duration of disease.
following 2 weeks' therapy, global assessments
both by investigators and patients rated treatment
results 'excellent' or 'good' in a greater percentage
of  xxxd236xxx -treated patients (dosage of 30mg daily
for up to 7 days and then iomg daily) than pla-

cebo-treated patients (p ::s;; 0.025). also, each symptom (follicular oedema, lid swelling, lacrimation,
photophobia and rhinorrhoea) was ameliorated to
a greater extent in the  xxxd236xxx  group than the
placebo group (p < 0.05). however, daily symptom
scores could not be compared, as only 17 of 52
participants delivered adequately completed diaries (de clercq et ai., unpublished).
both  xxxd236xxx  10 mg/day and  xxxd2572xxx 
5mg twice daily significantly reduced the severity
of all conjunctivitis symptoms after 2 and 6 weeks'
therapy. however, after 6 weeks' therapy  xxxd236xxx  had reduced lid swelling and follicular oedema
(but not lacrimation, photophobia or rhinorrhoea)
significantly more than  xxxd2572xxx  (p < 0.001 and
p = 0.05, respectively). the global assessment by
the investigator rated the results 'excellent' or 'good'
in more  xxxd236xxx -treated than mequitazinetreated patients (p < 0.05) [lods, unpublished].
as numerous patients suffering from rhinitis also
presented with conjunctivitis, vanden bussche
(1984a) reviewed the effects of  xxxd236xxx  on allergic ocular symptoms in these patients: 70 to 90%
of patients had an improvement in their ocular
symptoms.
3.3 trials in allergic dermatological
disorders
 xxxd236xxx  has shown beneficial effects on the
symptoms of chronic urticaria and itching associated with histamine wealing, but not on the symptoms of atopic dermatitis.
krause and shuster (1983) reported that neither
 xxxd236xxx  10 rug/day nor terfenadine 60mg thrice
daily (another non-sedating hi-histamine receptor
antagonist) affected the itch of atopic eczema assessed subjectively on a linear analogue scale and
measured objectively as nocturnal scratching. despite the small number of patients studied, a significant (p ::s;; 0.05) reduction in itch was demonstrated for both  xxxd2617xxx  loing thrice daily (a
strongly sedative h j-histamine receptor antagonist) and nitrazepam lomg administered at bedtime
(a sedative benzodiazepine anxiolytic). this effect
on itch is not merely a depressant effect on body

56

movement, because barbiturates in comparable sedative doses increase scratching (shuster, 1981).
similarly, astem izole 10 mg/day and placebo both
seemingly ameliorated the symptoms of atopic dermatitis during 6 weeks' therapy, but no difference
in efficacy was demonstrated between the 2 comparison groups (decroix et ai., unpublished). in
contrast, krause and shuster (1983) claim to have
found that both  xxxd236xxx  and terfenadine profoundly decreased itch and scratching associated
with histamine wealing (unpublished data, in preparation), and  xxxd236xxx  10 or 30 rug/day for up to
7 days followed by 10 rug/day for 3 more weeks
was significantly more efficacious than placebo
(double-blind comparisons) in ameliorating the
symptoms of chronic urticaria (erythema, papules
and itching) [damseaux et al., unpublished; knight ,
1984], which are generally accepted to be due to
the release of histamine and other mediators from
mast cells and circulating basophils (hill, 1979;
monroe and jones , 1977). additionally, in a small
open study ,s of 6 patients with chronic urticaria,
but none of 5 patients with pruritus, reported
symptomatic improvement with daily  xxxd236xxx 
therapy (mean maximum daily dose 15mg) [bateman et al., 1983a].
3.4 trials in chronic vertigo
in a small open study, the efficacy of  xxxd236xxx 
(30 rug/day and then 10 rug/day) for 30 days was
assessed in patients with chronic dizziness and
either spontaneous or positional nystagmus. after
2 and 4 weeks' therapy, 6 of the 10 patients showed
a clear decrease in spontaneous and/or positional
nystagmus (as assessed by electronystagmography)
and a rebound of nystagmus when the drug was
stopped (turner and jackson, 1983).

4. side effects
side effect data from over 20 (mostly doubleblind) efficacy trials, including 744 astemizoletreated patients, have been cumulated by the manufacturer (vanden bussche et al., 1984) [table v].
the most frequently reported side effects were cen-

57

 xxxd236xxx  : a review

tral nervous system (cns) depression (drowsiness,
dizziness, ataxia and inability to concentrate) and
dry mouth (15 and 5%, respectively). importantly,
the incidences of these side effects are quite similar
to those reported by placebo-treated patients in the
same studies (13 and 4.5%) and may indicate a
â¢preconditioning' of atopic patients to ant icipate
these effects due to previous antihistamine experience. the cumulated incidences of cns depression and dry mouth derived for the patients
receiving comparative hi-histamine receptor
antagonists were: 175 clemastine-treated patients,
32 and 9%; 104 ketotifen-treated patients, 21 and
3%; 39  xxxd2572xxx -treated patients, 46 and 8%; 18
chlorpheniramine-treated patients, 50 and ii %; and
20  xxxd2906xxx -treated patients, 55 and 15%, respectively (fig. 6). malmberg et al. (1983) reported
a significantly lower total number of days with
tiredness or dry mouth among  xxxd236xxx -treated
patients than  xxxd2906xxx -treated patients.

 xxxd236xxx : a review

other side effects reported by  xxxd236xxx -treated
patients include headache, gastrointestinal complaints (nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain or flatulence), rash or eczema and cns stimulation. a
report of increased appetite and bodyweight during
prolonged treatment 'suggests some cns penetration by the drug (wilson and hillas, 1983).

5. dosage anti administration
the recommended dosage of  xxxd236xxx  is iomg
(i tablet) once daily. in some countries up to 30mg

once daily for up to 7 days (then iomg daily) may
be given when symptoms are severe. in children
aged 6 to 12 years the daily dosage is one-half the
adult dose, and children younger than 6 years
should receive the suspension formulation (2 g/l)
in a dosage of2 mgllokg daily. optimal absorption
is achieved whim  xxxd236xxx  is taken on an empty
stomach.  xxxd236xxx  is contraindicated in women
who are pregnant. the extremely long duration of
inhibition of the weal and flare response (see section 1.4) could bias the results of skin tests in
 xxxd236xxx -treated patients not yet allergologically
investigated.

6. place of astemi::,o/e in therapy
the efficacy of  xxxd236xxx  has been convincingly demonstrated in allergic rhinitis (seasonal and
perennial) and it appears to be at least as effective
as several other h i-histamine receptor antagonists
in this condition. additionally, a few smaller studies indicate a beneficial activity against the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis and chronic urticaria
(but not atopic dermatitis).
the apparent lack of cns depression and anticholinergic effects with  xxxd236xxx  offers an important advantage over more 'traditional' hj-histamine receptor antagonists for patients bothered
by these side effects. however, similarly to other
members of its drug class,  xxxd236xxx  may increase
appetite and weight gain after prolonged use.
 xxxd236xxx  has a relatively long duration of action
and consequently offers the advantage of once daily
administration.

58

thus,  xxxd236xxx  offers a worthwhile improvement in side effect profile over 'traditional' antihistamines. in the absence of unexpected findings
with wider clinical use, non-sedating hi-histamine
receptor antagonists such as  xxxd236xxx  could well
become the drugs 'of choice' in many patients requiring antihistamine therapy.
