5- xxxd153xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx ) preparations (eg,  xxxd2579xxx ,  xxxd2579xxx ) are well-established preparations used in the management of
inflammatory bowel disease. these drugs are most useful for the treatment of mild to moderate flares of ulcerative colitis and, especially, for
maintenance of remission. although most gastroenterologists are very
familiar with these drugs, the interest in these drugs has undergone a
resurgence, with new preparations offering convenience and high dosage, while preserving their customary safety. new dosage regimens are
likely to become standard practice in the near future. there is also
considerable interest in chemoprevention of colorectal cancer in the
context of inflammatory bowel disease, and the role of long-term maintenance therapy with 5-asas in achieving such chemoprevention. a
mechanism of action for such chemoprevention has been provided by
the agonism of the  xxxg1807xxx 
by  xxxd2579xxx , which unifies its efficacy as an anti-inflammatory and
chemopreventive agent. in the future, even more effective agents based
on  xxxd2579xxx  are expected, based on more powerful agonism of  xxxg1807xxx ;  xxxd2579xxx  preparations have
become ‘trendy’ again.

la mésalazine dans la maladie inflammatoire de
l’intestin : de nouveau à la mode?
les préparations d’acide 5-aminosalicylique (5 asa) (p. ex., mésalazine,
mésalamine) sont couramment utilisées dans la prise en charge des
maladies inflammatoires de l’intestin. ces médicaments sont surtout utiles
pour le traitement des poussées de légères à modérées de la colite ulcéreuse
et notamment pour le maintien de la rémission. bien que la plupart des
gastro-entérologues connaissent bien ces agents, l’intérêt à leur endroit
renaît actuellement, puisque de nouvelles préparations offrent la même
commodité en doses plus fortes, tout en préservant le profil d’innocuité
habituel. les nouveaux schémas posologiques risquent de devenir la norme
dans un avenir rapproché. on s’intéresse également beaucoup à la
chimioprévention du cancer colorectal dans le contexte de la maladie
inflammatoire de l’intestin et au rôle du traitement d’entretien prolongé
par  xxxd2579xxx  pour parvenir à cette chimioprévention. on a proposé comme
mode d’action de cette chimioprévention l’agonisme des récepteurs gamma
activé par les proliférateurs du peroxysome au moyen du  xxxd2579xxx , qui allie
efficacité anti-inflammatoire et propriétés chimioprotectrices. on s’attend
à ce que des agents à base de  xxxd2579xxx  plus efficaces fassent leur apparition,
en raison d’un effet agoniste plus puissant du récepteur gamma activé par
les proliférateurs du peroxysome. les préparations de  xxxd2579xxx  sont revenues
à la mode.

u

lcerative colitis (uc) and crohn’s disease (cd) are
chronic relapsing conditions generally characterized by
repetitive cycles of active and quiescent disease. intestinal
inflammation can result in bleeding and anemia, perforation
with abscess or fistula formation, or subsequent fibrosis with
intestinal obstruction (1). the natural history of inflammatory
bowel disease (ibd) is dependent on the anatomical extent of
involvement and activity of disease. the anatomical location
and behaviour of cd, according to the vienna (2) (or the more
recent montreal) classification , changes over time. at diagnosis, cd is located in the terminal ileum in 47%, the colon in
28%, the ileocolon in 21% and the upper gastrointestinal tract
in 3% of patients. disease behaviour is classified as nonstricturing and nonpenetrating in 70% of patients, stricturing in
17% and penetrating (fistulas or abscesses or both) in 13% of
all patients at diagnosis. in clinical practice, disease activity is
typically described as mild to moderate (ambulatory patients
able to tolerate oral alimentation without manifestations of
dehydration, toxicity, abdominal tenderness, painful mass,
obstruction or more than 10% weight loss), moderate to
severe disease (failure to respond to treatment for mild disease,
more prominent symptoms of fever, weight loss, abdominal
pain or tenderness, intermittent nausea, and vomiting without

obstruction or significant anemia) and severe to fulminant
disease (persisting symptoms on corticosteroids, high fevers,
persistent vomiting or evidence of intestinal obstruction)
(2-4). in uc, 55% of patients have proctitis, approximately
30% of patients present with left-sided or distal colitis and only
approximately 15% of patients present with extensive colitis.
however, subsequent proximal extension occurs in approximately 35% of patients with initial proctitis or left-sided colitis. similar to cd, the severity of uc is classified as mild,
moderate, severe or fulminant. it is estimated that approximately 71% of patients present with moderately active uc,
whereas 20% present with mildly active disease (5). initial
therapy for patients with mild to moderate ibd depends on the
location and extent of disease, with oral or rectal therapies being
used individually or in combination. severe or fulminant disease
requires hospitalization and intensive parenteral therapy.
the goals of drug treatment in ibd are the induction and
maintainance of remission, achieving mucosal healing, the
avoidance of surgical intervention and decreasing the likelihood of cancer developing as a result of chronic inflammation.
 xxxd2579xxx  is useful in controlling active inflammation, maintaining remission and for chemoprevention. it has the advantage
of being generally well-tolerated and safe for long-term use with

flexible dosing.  xxxd2579xxx , also known as  xxxd2579xxx  or
5- xxxd153xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx ), is the first-line treatment for
ibd and remains the mainstay of treatment for mild to moderate uc; however, its use in cd is controversial (6). indeed, the
european crohn’s and colitis organization consensus recently
stated that oral aminosalicylates are not recommended for the
treatmetn of mild to moderate cd (7). however, both the
american and british national gastroenterology associations
recommend the use of high-dose  xxxd2579xxx  for the first-line treatment of mild ileal, ileocolonic or colonic cd (1,8). clearly,
there is conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of oral
aminosalicylates in active cd and their use in mild to moderate cd has been debated.
the action of  xxxd2579xxx  is believed to be predominantly
topical at the site of inflammation, especially within the colon.
the clinical aim, therefore, is to maximize delivery of the
active drug –  xxxd2579xxx  – to the colonic mucosa, while minimizing systemic absorption.

different  xxxd2579xxx  formulations and
mechanisms of action

5-asas are available in several oral and rectal (topical) formulations including tablets, micropellets (granules), suppositories and enemas, the latter may be aerosols, liquids or gels
(table 1).
 xxxd3255xxx  was the first  xxxd2579xxx  to be used for the treatment of symptoms and maintenance of remission in uc. it is
composed of  xxxd2579xxx  linked to sulfapyridine via a diazo bond
that is cleaved by bacterial azoreductases in the colon to release
the two components (9). its use as a maintenance agent in uc
is well documented, and in a meta-analysis of 11 trials involving 1598 patients (10),  xxxd3255xxx  had a slight therapeutic
advantage over  xxxd2579xxx  (or 1.29; 95% ci 1.05 to 1.57).
compared with  xxxd2781xxx  for the maintenance of remission,
 xxxd3255xxx  was found to be significantly more effective when
the ors from five trials were pooled (or 1.4; 95% ci 1.07 to
1.84) (10). a meta-analysis investigating the failure to induce
remission in active uc involving eight trials and 687 patients
(6) demonstrated no significant differences between  xxxd2579xxx 
and  xxxd3255xxx  at induction of remission (or 0.83; 95% ci
0.6 to 1.13).
it is recognized that a subgroup of patients with ibd suffer
from enteropathic arthropathy – a condition that can be divided into a pauciarticular, large joint arthropathy or a bilateral
128

symmetrical polyarthropathy with or without axial involvement (11).  xxxd3255xxx  has been shown to be beneficial in
treating the synovitis associated with gut inflammation in uc
rather than cd, if used in early disease (less than five years) and
in the presence of peripheral involvement (12). the efficacy of
 xxxd3255xxx  in the treatment of spondyloarthropathy has been
demonstrated in a multicentre, placebo-controlled trial involving more than 350 patients (13), showing greater efficacy over
placebo with respect to laboratory markers of inflammation
and patients’ own assessment of disease. it was suggested in
some treatment guidelines (1) that selected patients with uc
and reactive arthropathy would benefit from treatment with
 xxxd3255xxx . therefore,  xxxd3255xxx  continues to retain a
place in management.
the use of  xxxd3255xxx , however, is mainly limited by side
effects associated with allergic reactions and high rates of
intolerance (up to 20%) to the sulfapyridine component. as a
result, formulations based on the active moiety (ie,  xxxd2579xxx )
have been evaluated and two main methods of  xxxd2579xxx  delivery
have been used. the first class is azobonded compounds that
are controlled-release and ph dependent (ph 6 to 7). these
molecules are nonabsorbable prodrugs that are cleaved in the
colon by the bacterial enzyme  xxxg1592xxx  and released. drugs
that use this delivery strategy include  xxxd282xxx  ( xxxd282xxx ,
salix pharmaceuticals, usa) and  xxxd2781xxx  ( xxxd2781xxx ,
celltech pharmaceuticals inc, usa). the second class is a
composite (ph-dependent combined with controlled release),
in which the formulation contains a gastroresistant coating and
a ph/transit-dependent controlled-release that prevents  xxxd2579xxx 
release until the drug reaches the distal ileum. agents that use
this strategy are delayed-release  xxxd2579xxx  tablets ( xxxd2579xxx ,
procter & gamble pharmaceuticals, usa),  xxxd2579xxx  tablets
and  xxxd2579xxx  granustix (axcan pharma inc).  xxxd2579xxx  (shire
inc, usa), in contrast to the formulations described above,
releases  xxxd2579xxx  from the duodenum to the rectum, and is often
used ‘off-label’ to treat cd in addition to its indicated use for
uc (14,15).
the mechanism of action of  xxxd2579xxx  as an antiinflammatory drug is diverse. it appears to act locally on colonic mucosa and reduces inflammation through a variety of
anti-inflammatory processes. several potential targets of
 xxxd2579xxx  action have been proposed. the current hypothesis is
that  xxxd2579xxx  activates a synthetic class of nuclear receptor.
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar)-gamma is a
can j gastroenterol vol 24 no 2 february 2010

 xxxd2579xxx  in inflammatory bowel disease

key receptor that mediates the effect of  xxxd2579xxx  therapy in ibd
by transrepressing several key target genes such as nuclear factor b, signal transducers and activators of transcription. it has
a role in the regulation of intestinal inflammation and is highly
expressed in the colon, where epithelial cells and macrophages
are the main cellular sources of this nuclear receptor.  xxxg1807xxx  is also involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and
modulation of cytokine production and antitumourigenic
effects. therefore,  xxxg1807xxx  may form the basis for
chemopreventive strategies against colorectal cancer (crc).
however, additional mechanisms of action of  xxxd2579xxx 
have been described. these include the inhibition of mediators of lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase, interleukin-1, interleukin-2 and  xxxg2296xxx -alpha.  xxxd2579xxx  has also
been recognized as a potent antioxidant and free-radical scavenger (16-22).

clinical implications of medication
nonadherence in ibd patients

the reasons for noncompliance with  xxxd2579xxx  therapy are complex. male sex, single marital status, full-time employment and
three-times daily dosing have all been identified as independent predictors of noncompliance (23).
oral formulations that deliver  xxxd2579xxx  topically to the disease activity site require multiple daily dosing, which is
inconvenient. this multiple daily dosing can interfere with
patient quality of life and can have a negative impact on drug
adherance (24).
moreover, several studies have demonstrated that mucosal
concentrations of azobonded or bolus-release  xxxd2579xxx  formulations are highest in the right-sided colon, whereas in the leftsided colon, concentrations are much lower. a cross-sectional
study of american outpatients with quiescent uc (25) found
that only 40% were adherent to maintenance  xxxd2579xxx  therapy. several community-based studies have reported nonadherence rates in ibd patients ranging from 43% to 72%.
nonadherence to medication has important clinical implications in uc and cd patients, including increased risk of
relapses, possible risk of developing crc and the health care
costs of managing poor disease control (25-28).
increased risk of relapse
in a cohort study of 99 patients with quiescent uc (29), whose
adherence to  xxxd2579xxx  medication was monitored for two years,
39 patients experienced a recurrence of their symptoms, of
whom 32 (82%) were nonadherent to their prescribed medication. patients who did not adhere to their medication had a
greater than fivefold risk of disease recurrence than adherent
patients (hazard ratio 5.5; 95% ci 2.3 to 13; p<0.001). the
reasons for nonadherence to their prescribed regimen were
the following: 21 patients (30%) said there were too many
pills, 14 (20%) believed they did not need so much medication and 35 (50%) reported that they ‘just forgot’. the
investigators also found that patients with quiescent uc who
failed to adhere to their prescribed  xxxd2579xxx  regimen had a 61%
chance of relapse compared with only 11% among patients
who adhered to their prescribed therapy – a difference that was
statistically significant (p=0.001). it is possible, but unlikely,
that patients who relapse more often do not take their medication because they believe it is ineffective (30).
can j gastroenterol vol 24 no 2 february 2010

increased risk of developing crc
patients with ibd affecting the colon are at an increased risk
of developing crc. the risk of developing crc increases
with the extent and duration of uc and is associated with a
lifetime risk of approximately 20% (31). in addition, data
from population-based studies indicate that cd patients have
an increased risk of crc similar to that of uc patients.
prevention strategies such as surveillance, drug treatment, and
regular doctor visits are warranted and probably effective. in a
10-year cohort study of 175 patients with uc, moody et al (32)
demonstrated that the incidence of crc was significantly
higher (p<0.001) in patients (31%) who did not adhere to or
discontinued  xxxd3255xxx  therapy, compared with only a 3%
incidence in those who continued with long-term treatment.
these results were confirmed in a case-control analysis conducted by van staa et al (33) using a study population of 18,969
patients. regular users, defined as having six or more  xxxd2579xxx 
prescriptions in the previous 12 months, were found to have a
lower risk of crc than irregular users (crude or 0.7, 95% ci
0.44 to 1.03; adjusted or 0.60, 95% ci 0.38 to 0.96). these
results show some reduction in the risk of crc developing in
uc patients who adhere to regular  xxxd2579xxx  use. furthermore,
conclusions from a systematic review and meta-analysis of nine
observational studies involving almost 2000 patients (34) also
supported the protective role of  xxxd2579xxx  against crc development. more rigorous randomized controlled trials are unlikely,
and the effect size of this protection may be debated and can
be variable. chronic inflammation may be the trigger for the
colitis-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence;  xxxd2579xxx  may mitigate
this process by decreasing inflammation, and may act in a
more direct way by promoting apoptosis in neoplastic cells by
decreasing epithelial cell turnover.
increased health care costs
strategies to improve adherence are important to reduce the
high direct and indirect costs of a relapse. the high percentage
of nonadherent patients who have a relapse was associated
with a two- to threefold increase in the costs for nonhospitalized cases, with a 20-fold increase in costs for hospitalized cases
compared with quiescent cases of ibd (35). over a six-month
period, the total direct cost of caring for patients with ibd
ranged from uk £73 (approximately us $129) to uk £33,254
(us $58,980). the mean cost of care over six months for
patients with uc was uk £1,256 (us $2,228) and, while only
67 (14%) patients with ibd required hospitalization during the
six-month assessment period, they accounted for 49% of the
total secondary care costs.

strategies to optimize dose and
adherence of  xxxd2579xxx  in ibd:
‘new’  xxxd2579xxx  formulations

the ideal therapy would be an oral formulation, with fewer
tablets, requiring less frequent dosing and no side effects. more
recently, the introduction of promising new  xxxd2579xxx  formulations (table 2), offering high-dose and less frequent or
once-daily dosing regimens is likely to enhance patient compliance. these include  xxxd2579xxx  800 mg tablets ( xxxd2579xxx ,
procter & gamble pharmaceuticals, usa), 1.2 g multimatrix
(mmx) system  xxxd2579xxx  tablets ( xxxd2579xxx , shire inc, usa),
and 2 g ( xxxd2579xxx ) and 3 g  xxxd2579xxx  granule sachets ( xxxd2579xxx ).

 xxxd2579xxx  (800 mg tablet)
earlier clinical trials comparing the efficacy of 1.6 g/day versus
4.8 g/day  xxxd2579xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx ) in patients with mild to moderately active uc showed no definite differences in efficacy
between the doses, although systematic reviews have shown a
small benefit for higher doses in induction (36).
recently, the assessing the safety and clinical efficacy of a
new dose of  xxxd2579xxx  (ascend) i and ii trials (37,38) used a
new 800 mg tablet formulation of  xxxd2579xxx , comparing 4.8 g/day
of delayed-release  xxxd2579xxx  with 2.4 g/day. in the first trial
(ascend i) (37), 301 patients with mild to moderately
active uc were randomly assigned to receive oral  xxxd2579xxx 
2.4 g/day (400 mg tablets) or 4.8 g/day (800 mg tablets). the
primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved
complete remission or a clinical response to therapy. overall
improvement occurred in 51.3% of patients (77 of 150) treated
with  xxxd2579xxx  2.4 g/day and 55.9% of patients (76 of 136) treated
with 4.8 g/day (p=0.4411).
in the second trial (ascend ii) (38), the design was
amended to restrict the entry criteria to only 268 patients with
moderately active uc. seventy-two per cent of patients
receiving  xxxd2579xxx  4.8 g/day achieved treatment success at
week 6, compared with 59% of those who received 2.4 g/day
(p=0.036). the results of this study suggest that an acceptable
strategy may be that patients with mildly active uc be treated
initially with  xxxd2579xxx  2.4 g/day and patients with moderately
active uc with 4.8 g/day using the 800 mg tablets – such a
high dose in moderately active uc may also provide modestly
faster symptom relief (38).
the recent ascend iii (39) study confirmed the clinical
benefit of delayed-release  xxxd2579xxx  4.8 g/day in patients
with moderately active uc. the overall improvement at week
6 was higher with the 4.8 g/day dose only in subgroups of
patients who had received previous treatment with oral  xxxd2579xxx , rectal therapies, steroids or multiple medications. the
ascend program confirmed that high doses of  xxxd2579xxx  were
well tolerated and safe.
mmx  xxxd2579xxx  (1.2 g tablet)
mmx  xxxd2579xxx  (mmx  xxxd2579xxx , usa;  xxxd2579xxx  xl, united
kingdom and ireland,  xxxd2579xxx , rest of europe, shire
pharmaceuticals inc); offers a novel, high-strength (1.2 g/tablet)
delivery system, and has been used in patients with active, mild
to moderate uc. this delivery system uses lipophilic and hydrophilic matrices enclosed in a gastroresistant, ph-dependent
coating to facilitate prolonged exposure of the colonic mucosa
to the active moiety. the delivery system has been likened to
130

an absorbant sponge gradually breaking up and releasing
 xxxd2579xxx  throughout the colon.
the results of two large studies reported by kamm et al
(40) and lichtenstein et al (41) have shown that mmx  xxxd2579xxx  2.4 g/day (given once daily or as 1.2 g twice daily) or
4.8 g/day once-daily is well tolerated and efficacious for the
induction of clinical and endoscopic remission in patients with
active, mild to moderate uc. the uc disease activity index
score in these studies was modified by assigning the friability
parameter a score of 2. approximately 64% of patients in these
studies did not achieve strictly defined remission by endoscopic and clinical parameters by eight weeks of treatment
with mmx  xxxd2579xxx . those not achieving remission after
eight weeks were treated with steroids or other immunosuppressive therapies (42).
in a long-term, open-label, phase iii study, kamm et al (43)
evaluated the effect of prolonged, high-dose, oral  xxxd2579xxx  treatment over 12 months. the remission rate was similar to that
observed in the parent study (57% to 61.5%). the eight-week
extension part of the study suggests that some patients who
appear refractory to  xxxd2579xxx  may require only an extended
treatment with the high-dose mmx  xxxd2579xxx  (4.8 g/day) as
an alternative to step-up steroid therapy.
the current licensed dose of mmx  xxxd2579xxx  for the
induction of remission in patients with active, mild to moderate
uc is two to four 1.2 g tablets administered once daily. the
recommended dose for the maintenance of remission is 2.4 g
once daily (44).
once-daily  xxxd2579xxx  granules
 xxxd2579xxx  or  xxxd2579xxx  granules are micropellet formulations of
 xxxd2579xxx  preferred by some patients, especially those reluctant to
swallow relatively large tablets.
in a recent multicentre, investigator-blinded, randomized
controlled trial, patients with mild to moderate uc in remission were randomly assigned to a 2 g sachet of  xxxd2579xxx  granules ( xxxd2579xxx ) once daily or a 1 g sachet of  xxxd2579xxx  granules
twice daily. at one year, 74% and 64% of patients in the oncedaily and twice-daily groups, respectively, maintained clinical
and endoscopic remission. once-daily dosing was clinically
superior to, and had a higher adherence than twice daily dosing
(45). farup et al (46) compared the efficacy of an equal dose of
a prolonged-release granule formulation of  xxxd2579xxx  (4 g/day,
 xxxd2579xxx  sachet) divided into twice daily versus four times daily,
with that of prolonged-release  xxxd2579xxx  tablets at two doses of
0.5 g four times daily in 227 patients with mild to moderately
active uc. granules were as effective as tablets, and twicecan j gastroenterol vol 24 no 2 february 2010

 xxxd2579xxx  in inflammatory bowel disease

daily dosing was as effective as more frequent dosing (46). once
again, the study was designed to confirm the noninferiority of
the granule formulation to the tablet formulation. in another
study, the pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd2579xxx  for  xxxd2579xxx  sachets
administered 4 g once daily was also similar to that of 2 g given
twice daily. patient compliance was 97% (47).
 xxxd2579xxx  is a multiparticulate, granular formulation of
 xxxd2579xxx , with an enteric, acid-resistant film coating that
enables prolonged release in the colon. this formulation is
easier to swallow than enteric-coated tablets and may be preferred by some patients.
in a recent multicentre phase iii trial, kruis et al (48) demonstrated that once-daily dosing with  xxxd2579xxx  3 g ( xxxd2579xxx 
granules, falk pharma, germany) was as effective as threetimes daily dosing with  xxxd2579xxx  1 g for the treatment of
active uc. a total of 380 patients were evaluated for efficacy
and safety by intention-to-treat analysis, with 79.1% in the
once-daily dosing group and 75.7% in the three-times daily
group achieving remission (p<0.0001 for noninferiority). of
interest is the significantly greater therapeutic effect of the
once-daily dosing in proctosigmoiditis patients. this supports
the hypothesis that once-daily dosing leads to higher luminal
peak concentrations in the distal colon and that  xxxd2579xxx 
granules are well suited for oral treatment of distal disease. in
fact, most patients with uc tend to prefer the oral over the
rectal route of administration (48).
rectal-oral  xxxd2579xxx  combination therapy
rectally administered  xxxd2579xxx  has also been shown to be
superior to placebo for the maintenance of remission of distal
uc (49-52). a meta-analysis (53) has demonstrated the superiority of rectal  xxxd2579xxx  over placebo for maintenance of remission in uc at one year (or 15.2; 95% ci 4.7 to 55.9) .
rectal  xxxd2579xxx  is superior to rectal steroid therapy. in addition to patients with left-sided uc of mild to moderate severity, combined therapy also enhances the benefit in patients
with extensive, mild to moderately active uc. in a randomized
double-blind study performed in 127 ambulatory patients with
extensive mild/moderate active uc (54), all subjects received
oral  xxxd2579xxx  4 g/day (twice daily dosing) for eight weeks.
during the initial four weeks, they received an additional
enema at bedtime containing 1 g of  xxxd2579xxx  or placebo.
remission was achieved in 44% of the  xxxd2579xxx  enema group
versus 34% of the placebo enema group at four weeks (p=0.31),
and in 64% (95% ci 50% to 76%) of the  xxxd2579xxx  enema
group versus 43% of the placebo enema group at eight weeks
(p=0.03) (54).
similar studies with other preparations of  xxxd2579xxx , especially
the new formulations, are required to demonstrate whether
combination oral-rectal therapy offers benefit. whether such
combination therapy offers advantage over simply increasing
the dose of oral preparation also requires further study.
rectal  xxxd2579xxx  therapy
foam and gel preparations are generally better tolerated than
liquid enemas. adherence requires motivation and some training, as well as choice of the most appropriate delivery device.
increased dosing regimens do not generally enhance the benefit
of rectal delivery and once-daily is sufficient. inflammation at
the distal rectum may require the use of a  xxxd2579xxx  suppository.

conclusions

 xxxd2579xxx ,  xxxd2579xxx  or  xxxd2579xxx  are the first-line therapy for
patients with mild to moderate uc and remain the mainstay of
maintenance therapy. current delivery formulations, such as
oral and rectal  xxxd2579xxx , present many limitations including
inconvenience, poor-adherence dosing (number of tablets) and
dose frequency (three to four times daily dosing), lack of efficacy in all types of uc and cd, and poor patient acceptability.
therefore, twice-daily dosing is common and once-daily dosing
is now a reality. the use of  xxxd2579xxx  preparations in the management of uc is summarized in table 3.
nonadherence to a prescribed regimen of  xxxd2579xxx  has been
shown to dramatically increase the risk of relapse, resulting in
decreased quality of life and increased health care and personal
costs. adherence to  xxxd2579xxx  therapy has also been associated
with a possibly reduced risk of crc. indeed, the benefit of
 xxxd2579xxx  in the primary prevention of dysplasia and crc in uc
has been established and generally accepted despite the lack of
double-blind, randomized studies.
new formulations of  xxxd2579xxx  have been developed and
show promise in improving compliance and efficacy. these
new  xxxd2579xxx  formulations, with less frequent or once-daily
administration, and with different delivery systems include
micropellet and mmx oral formulations, as well as rectal gel
and once-daily suppository formulations, have demonstrated
efficacy in active mild to moderately active uc and in the
maintenance of remission. although more robust evidence is
necessary, it is likely that  xxxd2579xxx  preparations will be widely
used for chemoprevention of crc in uc and, as such, probably should also be used in colonic cd. several studies have
also demonstrated that these novel formulations are safe, offer
a simplified dose regimen, and result in improved quality life
and possibly compliance in patients, with pharmacoeconomic
benefits. in the future, new  xxxd2579xxx  preparations with more
effective  xxxg1807xxx  modulation are anticipated. it is likely
that higher doses of the new formulations will be tested again
for efficacy in cd as well.
