abstract: microtubules (mts) play important and diverse roles in eukaryotic cells. their function and
biophysical properties have made alpha−and beta−tubulin, the main components of mts, the subject of intense study.
interfering with normal mt dynamics, for example, by the addition of tubulin ligands, can cause the cell great
distress and affect mt stability and functions, including mitosis, cell motion and intracellular organelle
transport. it has been shown in the literature that tubulin is an important target molecule for developing
anticancer drugs. tubulin binding molecules have generated considerable interest after the successful
introduction of the taxanes into clinical oncology and the widespread use of the vinca alkaloids vincristine and
 xxxd3511xxx . these compounds inhibit cell mitosis by binding to the protein tubulin in the mitotic spindle and
preventing polymerization into the mts. this mode of action is also shared with other natural agents eg
colchicine and  xxxd2980xxx . however various tubulin isotypes have shown resistance to taxanes and other
mt agents. therefore, there is a strong need to design and develop new natural analogs as antimitotic agents to
interact with tubulin at sites different from those of vinca alkaloids and taxanes. this minireview provides sar
on several classes of antimitotic agents reported in the literature. the structures and data given are essential to
the scientists who are involved in drug design and development in the field of anticancer drugs.

microtubules
microtubules, the dynamic pipe-like protein composed of
alpha,beta-heterodimers, are integral components of the mitotic
spindle which is intimately involved in cell division.
microtubules (mts) are long, hollow structures with 5nm
walls surrounding a cavity, usually with internal and
external diameters of 15 and 25nm, respectively. they are
made up of two globular protein subunits, alpha- and  xxxg2353xxx .
the alpha and beta subunits form heterodimers which aggregate in
a head to tail arrangement to form long tubes made up of
stacked rings with each ring usually containing 13 subunits,
which is known as protofilament [1-8]. after an induction
period, the protofilaments group together to form a c-shaped
protein sheet, which then curl around to give a pipe-like
structure known as microtubule.
mts are the principal components of the cytoskeleton of
eukaryotic cells required for cell division, motility, cell form
and morphogenesis, secretion, and cell surface specialization.

constitutes the binding surface of kinesin  xxxg1276xxx , a motor
protein that is essential for production of a bipolar spindle.
the n-terminal consists of six parallel beta strands alternating
with helices. a mixed beta-sheet of four strands and three
surrounding helices run across the first two domains on the
outside surface of the mt.
an aggregation of gamma-tubulins, organised in the ring
structures within centrosomes, are involved in nucleating
mts.  xxxg2357xxx  is implicated in the formation of basal
bodies and centrioles. its loss is associated with a failure to
produce the c tubule of the triplet mts.
mts grow from discrete assembly sites in cells called
microtubule organizing centers (mtocs). these mtocs
form a focus for mts growth, and all microtubules initially
begin to grow from one of those centers. in most cells there
is one major type of mtoc known as the cell center, or
centrozome, which contains two microtubular structures
known as centrioles. organisation of microtubule growth at
the motc involves the presence of gamma-tubulin.

alpha- and  xxxg2353xxx , each with a molecular weight of about
50 kda, are regarded as the main components of mt. the
structures of alpha- and  xxxg2353xxx  are basically identical: each
monomer is formed by a core of two beta-sheets surrounded by
alpha-helices. the monomer structure is very compact, but can
be divided into three functional domains: the amino terminal
domain containing the nucleotide-binding region, an
intermediate domain containing the paclitaxel-binding site,
and the carboxy-terminal domain, which probably

two molecules of energy rich  xxxd2247xxx 
(gtp) are also essential components of mts. one of these
gtp molecules is tightly bound and cannot be removed
without denaturing the heterodimer, while the other gtp
molecule is freely exchangeable with unbound gtp. gtp is
non-exchangeably bound to alpha-tubulin, whereas gtp and
 xxxd1248xxx  (gdp) can exchange on beta. the
exchangeable gtp molecule is intimately involved in the
regulation of tubulin functions. binding of this nucleotide
to the protein is required for mt polymerization, whereas
the hydrolysis of the gtp bound to polymerized tubulin is
required for mt depolymerization.

cytoskeleton. the following factors are responsible for the
dynamic property of mts:
1.

gtp / gdp: tubulin is a gtp bound protein
required for mt polymerisation, whereas the
hydrolysis of the gtp bound to polymerised tubulin
is required for mt depolymerisation. the rate of mt
nucleation and elongation is thought to be influenced
by the free gtp-tubulin concentration.

2.

ion concentration: polymerisation of tubulin heterodimer is regulated by c a 2 + concentration. the low
cytosolic ca2+ level characteristic of the resting state
of most eukaryotic cells promotes mt assembly,
while localised increases in ca 2 + cause mt
disassembly.

3.

conformational change: nucleotide dependent
conformational change is also responsible for the
dynamic assembly/ disassembly property of tubulin.

4.

microtubules are constantly assembled and
disassembled by warmth, cold and other factors.

function of mts
1.

to form mitotic spindles required for the movement
of chromosomes to the poles of the new cell during
cell division.

2.

to give cells both shape and an organised structure.

3.

to provide the tracks for transport of vesicles,
organelles such as secretory granules, and
mitochondria from one part of the cell to another.

role of mts in cell division [39-40]
microtubules are mainly responsible for mitosis - a stage
in the process of cell division where segregation of
chromosomes occurs prior to cell replication. mitosis is a
particularly attractive stage of the cell cycle for interference
of normal function.

mts isotypes [43-45]

mts dynamics [39,41-42]

tubulin, an alpha, beta-heterodimer, exists as several isotypic
forms which differ in their amino acid sequences and their
conformations e.g., betai, betaii, betaiii, betaiva, betaivb and betav.

microtubules are continuously assembled and
disassembled and therefore are dynamic portions of the cell

beta i and beta ivb are constitutive; beta ii and beta iva are formed in
the brain and nervous system; betaiii is restricted to neurons &

fig. (1). classification of antimitotic agents (mode of action and binding sites of mt inhibitors).

microtubulin binding sites as target for developing anticancer agents

a small number of other cells; betav is found in hematopoietic
tissues and the distribution of beta v is unknown. alpha-tubulin
mrnas encode five distinct isotypes.
the different levels of stability for dimers formed with
different isotypes may be related to mts stability eg dimers
containing beta iii tubulin are more stable than dimers
containing betaii, but they form more dynamic mts. paclitaxel
resistant prostate carcinoma cells express higher levels of betaiii
and beta iva isotypes, with up to nine times the normal levels
of beta iii mrna and mts formed with beta iii and beta iv isotypes
are over seven times more resistant to paclitaxel. ovarian
tumor cells show an almost fivefold increase in the amount
of betai, betaiii and betaiva isotypes.
mts as a target for developing anticancer drugs
microtubules are essential for the process of mitosis
during cell proliferation. the importance of mts makes
them a sensitive target for developing anticancer drugs.
mitotic inhibitors act by interfering with the mitosis of
cells during the m phase of cell cycle and most drugs that
prevent cell division by interfering with mitosis are m phase
specific. cytotoxic tubulin-binding agents are unique among
anticancer drugs in that they target the mitotic spindle rather
than dna. the unique dynamic characteristic of mts
provides a basis for the rational design of mitotic inhibitors
as antitumor agents and reveals a new way of discovering
superior antimitotic drugs, which target rapidly proliferating
cancer cells rather than normal cells.
classification of mt inhibitors
tubulin binding molecules have generated considerable
interest among cytotoxic agents due in part to the successful
introduction of the taxanes and vinca alkaloids in clinical
oncology. microtubulin inhibitors can be classified
according to the mechanism or site of action (fig. 1):
1. drugs binding to tubulin
a. mt depolymerization inhibitors: taxanes,  xxxd2014xxx 
and discodermolide.
b. mt polymerization inhibitorsi.

colchicine binding site: colchicine,
 xxxd2980xxx  and  xxxd1744xxx .

ii. vinca alkaloids binding site: vinca alkaloids,
dolastatin and cryptophysin.
2. drugs binding to other sites
a. maps:  xxxd2041xxx  and  xxxd2666xxx .
b. sulfhydril groups: ethylene bisiodoacetamide and
calvatic acids.
3. drugs binding to unknown site: tryphostin, moroidin,
dz3358.

alkaloids and inhibiting the depolymerisation of
polymerised tubulin [46-48]. the first marketed taxoid drug
was paclitaxel (1) which was isolated from the bark of the
pacific yew tree taxus brevifolia nutt. (taxaceae) [49]. this
endangered tree produces low yields of paclitaxel that cannot
satisfy the increasing demand. later paclitaxel was also
isolated from hazelnut trees (leaves, twigs, and nuts) and the
fungi living on these trees but the concentration is only
about 10% of the concentration in yew trees [50]. this drug
has now been fully synthesized [51-52] and at present is
used extensively in the treatment of breast and ovarian
cancers. it is also used for skin, lung, and head and neck
carcinomas [53]. chemistry of this diterpinoid is very
complex comprising of an unususal oxetane ring at c4-c5
and an isoserine side chain at c-13 position. although some
therapeutically active paclitaxel analogues modified at c10
and c2 have been developed as advanced second generation
taxoids [54], structural variations along the upper part at c6c12 appear to have less impact on the bioactivity. the lower
part, on the other hand, comprising of c14 and c1-c5
appears to be a region which is crucial to the activity. most
changes to the c- and d- rings, including opening of the
oxetane ring, lead to loss of activity [55], although some
examples of c-ring opened compounds that retain significant
activity have been developed [56].
extensive structure activity relationship (sar) studies
have provided insight into the structural determinants that
are important for the activity of paclitaxel. it is now
established that the a-ring side chain at c13 with a c2'-oh,
the c2 benzoyl group and an intact oxetane ring at c4-c5
are essential for both the cytotoxicity and stabilization of
mts [57-60] . the oxetane ring is a unique feature of
paclitaxel and analogues prepared with an opened oxetane
ring have a greatly reduced activity [55]. the c4 acetyl
group does not appear to play a significant role in the
biological activity but may contribute to the defined
conformation of the molecule. the c1-oh group makes a
significant contribution to the overall bioactivity [55]. the
oh group at c-7 is not essential for biological activity [60].
the taxane ring binds near the m-loop; the c2 benzoyl
ring in proximity to his227 and asp224 [62], and the c13
benzamido group within the n-terminal 1-31 amino acids of
 xxxg2353xxx  [63]. the main interaction of the taxane ring with
tubulin is at l275 at the beginning of the b8-h9 loop [10].
paclitaxel is semisynthesized from baccatin iii (4), an
analogue of paclitaxel without the c13 side chain, which is
isolated from taxus baccata l [64]. cytotoxicity of baccatin
iii is practically insignificant whereas 2-m-azidobaccatin iii
(5), a taxol analogue lacking the complete a ring in the c13
side chain but with a m-azido benzoyl at the c2 position of
the taxane ring, inhibited cell proliferation in human cancer
cells at nanomolar concentrations [65]. recently, it has been
demonstrated that baccatin iii could cause apoptotic cell
death without affecting the cell cycle g2 /m phase [66].
deaminoacetyl taxinea (6), isolated from t. baccata l, with
an unusual tricyclic hexadecane skeleton and an acetate
moiety at c13, has no cytotoxic activity [67]. two other
novel open oxetane ring taxoids, taxumairols n (7) and o
(8), have been isolated from the roots of taxus mairei [68].
two new bicyclic taxanes (10,11) diterpinoid [69], two

of paclitaxel [72]. these results imply that the c13 side
chain is not always essential for promoting tubulin
polymerisation. when the core structure of taxane is
substantially modified, a c-5 side chain may lead to
bioactive taxanes [75]. a good number of novel taxanes have
also been isolated from canadian yew [74].

microtubulin binding sites as target for developing anticancer agents

mini-reviews in medicinal chemistry, 2004, vol. 4, no. 10 1081

to date, more than 350 taxoids have been isolated from
the taxus species, developed and characterized [76-77] but
very few are found to be potent cytotoxics. poor water
solubility and a very low yield of paclitaxel motivated
researchers to design and develop new analogues of
paclitaxel that are more cytotoxic.  xxxd1919xxx  (2), with
minimal structural modifications [78] at c13 side chain and
c10 substitution showed more water solubility and more
potency than paclitaxel, whereas baccatin, without c13 side
chain, has no significant cytotoxicity. clinical trials have
shown that patients who develop hypersensitivity to
paclitaxel may receive docetaxel without an allergic response
[79]. the c13 side chain could be a target for developing
new analogues. 2-debenzoyl-2- (m-azidobenzoyl) paclitaxel
(3), a c2 modified analogue, was found to be more potent
(ic 50 0.31 ± 0.01 µm) than paclitaxel (ic50 0.42 ± 0.03
µm) [80]. 14beta-hydroxy-10-deacetylbaccatin iii (14beta-ohdab, 16), first isolated from the needles of himalayan yew
tree, has a higher water solubility [81]. new taxoids derived
from it may show improved water solubility, bioavailability
and reduced hypersensitivity [54]. synthesis of second
generation taxoids by appropriate modification at c-3', c-2
and acylation at c-10, produces taxoids [82-84] with
extremely high potency against drug resistant cancer cells
and compounds 17-19 showed two orders of magnitude
better activity than those of paclitaxel and docetaxel [54,85].
our laboratory is involved in developing simple but better
paclitaxel like drugs based on receptor topography.

to evaluate the necessity of the taxane core of taxoids,
simplified compounds typified by (21) with the key
pharmacophore properties of paclitaxel, phenylisoserine and
an oxetane ring, were synthesised but none showed
promising tubulin inhibitory activity. this finding justifies
the necessity of the diterpene ring [86]. novel 7-deoxy-9dihydropaclitaxel analogues, typified by (20), have been
synthesised and found to have potent selectivity against
human liver cancer cells [87]. synthesis of a new class of
borneol esters (22) that might be considered as analogues of
paclitaxel has been reported but these compounds showed
reduced cytotoxic activity [88].
design of new taxanes has been directed towards solving
the limitations of both solubility and resistance. the
paclitaxel ester of malic acid (23) has demonstrated
improved solubility and enhanced in vivo antitumor activity
against p388 murine leukemia indicating a higher
therapeutic index than paclitaxel [89]. the targeted delivery
of paclitaxel has also been reported - octreotide-conjugated
paclitaxel demonstrated cell selectivity and exerted the same
antitumor effect as free paclitaxel [90].
other paclitaxel site binding drugs
the epothilones a (24) and b (25), naturally occuring
antimitotic agents isolated from the myxobacterium
sorangium cellulosum [91-92], exhibit cytotoxicity by the
same mechanism as paclitaxel and are active against

indicated that replacement of epoxide moiety of  xxxd2014xxx 
a with cyclopropyl group leads to total loss of activity
[100]. these drugs are not recognised by multi-drug resistant
cells and therefore produce much higher potency than
paclitaxel in multi-drug resistant cell lines. epothilones are
more water-soluble than paclitaxel thereby offering distinct
advantages.

with ic50 similar to that of paclitaxel [101]. this drug is
effective against breast, renal, ovarian and lung cancer. sar
profile of eleutherobin analogues revealed that removal or
replacement of the c15 sugar moiety alters cytotoxic
potency [102].

with ic50 values in the 200-500nm range. sarcodictyns a
&b have also been synthesized [118].

discodermolide (31), a polyhydroxylated alketetraene
lactone marine product, isolated from the carribean sponge
discodermia dissolute [103], inhibited cell mitosis and
induced formation of stable tubulin polymer in vitro and
considered to be more effective than paclitaxel with ec50
value of 3.0 µm versus 23 µm [104]. total synthesis of this
drug has also been reported [105,106].

colchicine and its analogues

1b.i: colchicine binding site
colchicine (45), a well known alkaloid, obtained from
colchicum autumnale and other plants, a classic tubulin
binding agent [119], is used in the treatment of gout,
familial mediterranean fever and liver cirrhosis [120-123].
colchicine binds to soluble tubulin and forms a tubulincolchicine complex, followed by ligand-induced
conformational changes in both tubulin and colchicine itself
and thereby causes the mt spindle to disassemble in the
metaphase of mitosis. the binding site (s) of colchicine on
tubulin have been extensively studied [124,125]. it has been
reported that the beta -subunit of tubulin is involved in
colchicine binding, with the a ring of colchicine lying
between cys-354 and cys-239 and c ring lying between the
peptide region containing cys-239 and the amino terminal
 xxxg2353xxx  sequence [126] and region beta:1-36 [127]. the seven
membered b-ring and the c7 side chain are not believed to
be crucial for tubulin binding but may affect the
conformation of colchinoids and their tubulin binding
properties [128]. the trimethoxyphenyl group of the a-ring
of colchicine serves as a complex stabilizing anchor on
tubulin in the inhibition of mts assembly and is essential
for its activity [129]. an important structural feature of
colchicine is the alpha-methoxytropolone, which constitutes the
c-ring portion of the colchicine molecule. the tropolone
ring and the c-9 or c-10 substitutes have been implicated in
several aspects of the ligand-tubulin binding mechanism
[130]. this drug has also been reported to bind to a second,
lower affinity site on tubulin in a reversible manner [131].
although colchicine is one of the oldest antimitotic drugs,
its toxicity is similar to its activity. hundreds of colchicine
analogues have been prepared in past decades, including
compounds isolated from natural sources, partially
synthesized from colchicine, and synthesized de novo. some
have been used clinically as antitumor agents, having less
toxicity than colchicine. most modified colchicine analogues
share a common binding site on tubuliun, common

laulimalide (32) and isolaulimalide (33), macrocyclic
lactoses isolated from the marine sponge cacospongia
mycofijiensis, are inhibitors of cell proliferation with ic50
values in the low nanomolar range (32) and low micromolar
range (33) respectively [107]. although their mechanism of
action is unknown they are considered to be paclitaxel like
microtubule stabilising agent.
(-)-rhazinilum (34), isolated from melodinus australia
[108], rhazya stricta [109], and kopsia singapurensis [110]
has been reported to mimic the effects of both  xxxd3511xxx 
and paclitaxel by inducing a non-reversible assembly
(spirilization) of tubulin ( xxxd3511xxx  type effect) and by
inhibiting the cold-induced disassembly of microtubules
(pclitaxel like effect) [111,112]. (-)-rhazinil (35), a formyl
derivative of rhazinilum has also been isolated from a
related kopsia species [111]. sar studies deriving from
these analogues suggest that the presence of the phenylatedpyrole unit and the lactam ring as well as restricted rotation
about the biaryl axis is required for antimitotic activity
[113]. the presence of hydrophobic groups at c14 on d-ring
led to a large decrease in the antitubulin activity [114]. (±)b-norrhazinal (36), a conformationally more constrained
analogue of rhazinilum congeners, has been synthesised and
found to be cytotoxic against human ca46 burkitt
lymphoma cells with ic50 value of 3 µm [115].
sarcodictyns (37-40), structurally similar to eleutherobin,
have been isolated from marine corals sarcodictyon roseum
[116] and eleutherobia species [117] and sarcodictyns a &
b showed antiproliferative activity in six human cancer cells

obtained from colchicum cornigerum [136]. allocolcichine
(43) which has also been isolated from c. autumnale [137]
and n-acetylcolchinol o-methylether, a semisynthetic
analogue obtained by reaction of colchicine with hydrogen
peroxide [138] , are both more potent inhibitors than
colchicine in itp and icb assays [139,140].

show an inhibitory effect on tubulin polymerisation.
compound 46, a bicyclic analogue of colchicine binds
rapidly and reversibly to colchicine binding site of tubulin,
inhibits microtubules assemble and promotes apoptosis in
human leukemic cells [135]. this drug produces reversible

more water solubility and has lower toxicity than colchicine
[135].

isolated from dried roots of  xxxd2980xxx  peltatum and

treatment of liver sclerosis, constipation, rheumatism and
cancer. its antimitotic activity was first reported at least 50
years ago.  xxxd2980xxx  has also been reported to use in
the treatment of venereal warts but is too toxic to be of
clinical value.  xxxd2980xxx  and its related analogues
bind to tubulin protein at the colchicine site and

and colchicone (45) which are both synthetic, have shown
more activity than the parent colchicines [14]. most natural

microtubulin binding sites as target for developing anticancer agents

mini-reviews in medicinal chemistry, 2004, vol. 4, no. 10 1085

competitively inhibit colchicine binding to tubulin although
a recent computer modeling study suggested incomplete
overlap of the colchicine and  xxxd2980xxx  binding site
(s) [141]. hitotsuyanagi et al. synthesised 4-aza-2,3dehydro-4-deoxypodophyllotoxins (48, 49) and found that
compound 48 is twice as active as natural  xxxd2980xxx 
[142]. etoposide (50) and  xxxd3309xxx  (51), two semisynthetic
less toxic analogues of  xxxd2980xxx  have been
developed [143]. etoposide (50) is a potent topoisomerase-ii
(an enzyme involved in the folding and unfolding of dna
during cell replication) inhibitor but a weak tubulin inhibitor
[144,145]. it has also been reported that their predominant
function is inhibiting  xxxg2312xxx  rather than a microtubular
interaction [146]. etoposide is currently used in the
treatment of small cell lung, testicular and malignant
lymphoid cancers, among others [147]. it is also used in
combination chemotherapy. compound 56 which contains a
p-nitroanilino moiety at the 4beta position is a  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitor
causing dna double strand breakage and g2 phase arrest
and it is in clinical trial in taiwan [148]. compound (57),
another analogue of etoposide, showed 10-fold more potency
than etoposide in both cell killing and  xxxg2312xxx  inhibition
assay [148].  xxxd3309xxx  (51) appears to be a less useful
clinical agent though it is undergoing trials in combination
therapy for the treatment of metastatic brain tumors [149].

to interact with the colchicine site on tubulin, therefore the
effect of structural features on selective inhibition of tubulin
and topo-ii provide promise for further azatoxin derivative
design [132]. benzatoxins (54,55), the congeners of
azatoxins, displayed activity greater than that of colchicine
for the inhibition of tubulin polymerization [154].
combretastatins
combretastins (58), an antineoplastic agents isolated
from the south african tree combretum caffurum [155,156],
are simple compounds that show antimitotic effects by
interacting with the colchicine binding site of tubulin.
combretastin a-4 (59) is one of the most potent inhibitors
of colchicine binding presently known [157]. naturally
occurring and synthetic  xxxd1744xxx  and its analogues (596 1 ) were identified as antimitotic agents binding to
colchicine binding sites [132].  xxxd1744xxx  a-4 (59), the
most potent cancer cell growth inhibitor of the series
[125,158,159] is not recognised by the multi-drug resistance
(mdr) pump, a cellular pump which rapidly ejects foreign
molecules including many anti-cancer drugs [41]. it has also
been reported that this compound can inhibit angiogenesis, a
process essential for tumor growth [161] . sar of
 xxxd1744xxx  a-4 led to the discovery of the potent cancer
cell growth inhibitor phenstatin (63a) and hydroxyphenstatin
(63b), which showed remarkable antineoplastic activity by
inhibiting tubulin polymerization with activity comparable
to that of  xxxd1744xxx  a1 (15) [162]. synthesized
 xxxd1744xxx  d derivatives (67-71) [163] stabilize
microtubules to various degrees with the derivatives bearing
polar substituents being most active [164]. various water

two interesting synthetic compounds, azotoxin (52) and
methylazotoxin (5 3 ) with structural similarity to 4demethyldeoxypodophyllotoxin were found to be dual
inhibitors of topo-ii and tubulin polymerization [150,151].
azatoxins (52,53) exhibit dual targeting of both  xxxg2312xxx 
and tubulin [152,153] and 4-methylazatoxin has been found

soluble benzylaniline hydrochloride salts were synthesised
and evaluated for potential therapeutic value in the treatment
of cancers [165]. these compounds bind to tubulin in the
same manner as  xxxd1744xxx  a-4. the most promising
compound in this series was 4-methyl-n- (3,4,5trimethoxybenzyl)aniline hydrochloride (62), with an ic50
value of 3.5 µm in the itp assay and cytotoxicity against a
wide variety of cancer cell lines [132]. combretastin
glucuronide (64), in which the  xxxd1744xxx  core has been
coupled to a small number of sugar moieties, is highly water
soluble [166], but about 100-fold less potent than the parent
phenol [132].

breast cancer has apparent anti-estrogenic activity and
remarkably low toxicity in rodents [170,171]. it inhibits
tubulin polymerization in vitro with an ic50 value of
6.7±0.9 µm [172]; however, its metabolite zcc (76) was
not active in vitro.

diphenylselenides (65) and diphenylsulfides (66), a
second class of analogues produced in an attempt to mimic
combretastin, do not appear to inhibit mt formation but
disrupt the cell cycle and cause mitotic arrest by interaction
with microtubules [167]. these agents bind strongly to
tubulin dimer and may somehow alter the conformation of
the tubulin protein, encouraging polymerization [160].
combretatropones (72,73), hybrids of combretastin and
colchicine, were synthesized and evaluated by andres et al
[168].

flavonols (77-79) have been reported to have antitumor
activity [132] and two flavonols (77,78) were found to
inhibit tubulin polymerization and colchicine binding to
tubulin. centauridin (77) was isolated from polymnia
fruticosa and identified as a tubulin inhibitor174. flavonol-2
(78) was isolated from several plants including zieridium
pseudobtusifolium, acronychia porteri, polanisia dodendra,
p. tachysperma, guttierrezia microcephala and g. sarothra
[132,175,176]. flavonol-2 and centauridin have been shown
to inhibit tubulin polymerization with ic50 values of 0.83
and 2.0 µm, and to inhibit colchicine binding to tubulin by
59% and 35% when present at the same concentration as
tubulin [176]. flavonol-2 (78) also displayed remarkable
cytotoxicity in vitro against panels of central nervous
system, non-small cell lung, ovarian, colon and renal
cancers, melanoma, and leukemia cells with values in low
micromolar to nanomolar concentration range [176] .
compound 30 also showed potent cytotoxicity against a
panel of human tumor cell lines and was found to be a

in a tubulin related bioassay, 72 inhibited tubulin
polymerization with an ic50 value of 8.6 µm, and 24 had an
ic 50 value of 12.0 µm. in comparison, colchicine had an
ic50 value of 3.5 µm [168]. a series of stilbenes related to
the combretastin were synthesized and compound 25
exhibited potent tubulin polymerization inhibitory activity
with an ic50 value of 2.0 µm and was cytotoxic against an
array of cancer cell cultures [157,169]. z-1, 1-dichloro-2,3diphenylcyclopropane (75), a known synthetic agent used for

microtubulin binding sites as target for developing anticancer agents

strong inhibitor of tubulin polymerization with ic50 value
0.83± 0.2 µm and a potent inhibitor of radiolabelled
colchicine binding to tubulin [176].

dihydro-3-phenylpyrido[3,4-b]pyrazin-7-yl carbamate, are
reported to bind to tubulin in a region that overlaps with the
colchicine site and to induce formation of abnormal
polymers of gtp-mg-tubulin [184].

aromatic carbamets

these compounds, along with their related cyclic and
acyclic analogues, all contain the aromatic carbamate
functionality (ar-nhco2r), and are related to  xxxd2745xxx 
and tubulazole-c (87), which were found to be cytotoxic to
mammalian cells and to parasitic organisms [185] .
investigation of this toxicity demonstrated that the drug was
an effective mt destabilising agent, being more effective
than both colchicine and  xxxd2745xxx  [186]. however,
tubulazole-c (87), showed poor water solubility which led
to the development of the more soluble derivative,
erbulazole (88) which has a 10-fold increase in activity
[187].

carbamets are a group of dihydropyridopyrazines (80),
which have been found to bind to tubulin at nanomolar
concentration, prevented the formation of mts and
competitively inhibited the binding of colchicines [177].
carbamets also showed activity against a number of
multidrug-resistant cell lines [178]. of these compounds, the
2-methyl derivative (80), is in clinical trial [179].
diphenyl quinazolone (81) is also a potent antimitotic
agent which has activity in vivo [180]. further investigations
on this compound are ongoing [181]. replacing the pyridine
ring with an imidazole ring system resulted in the synthesis
of a number of imidazo[4,5-c] pyridines (82-83) which
showed activity against the formation of mts both in vitro
and in vivo, although these compounds were much less
potent than the dihydropyridopyrazines [182]. the synthetic
compound bis-carbamet (84) is also reported to have tubulin
inhibitory properties in vitro and activity at micromolar
concentrations [183]. nsc 613862-s (86) and nsc 613863r (86), two isomers of ethyl 5-amino-2-methyl-1, 2-

chalcones
chalcones (89), benzacetophenone molecules containing
a trimethoxy phenyl group, have been synthesised and found
to be potent cytotoxic agents with ic50 values of around
4nm against hela cells [188]. studies in animal tumor
models indicated that these drugs showed up to 300 times
more potency than that of colchicine in terms of arresting

cell division.  xxxd2980xxx  was shown to displace the
chalcones from their binding site on tubulin, which
supported its colchicine binding site [189]. a series of novel
2'-aminochalcones have been synthesised and compound 90
showed potent antitumor activity [190].
ampethinile
ampethinile (91) has cytotoxic activity and is reported to
terminate pregnancy in rats [191]. it competitively binds to
colchicine site of tubulin [192] and has undergone clinical
trial [160].
curacin a
curacin a (92), isolated from the marine blue-green
cyanobacterium lyngbya majuscula, inhibits microtubule
formation and the binding of colchicine to tubulin dimmers

[193-195] . in addition, small amounts of the nearly
equipotent curacins b and c (structure are not shown) were
obtained from the extracts [196]. curacin a is the most
potent of this family and has an ic50 value of 1.8pm in
chinese hamster aux bi cells [160]. the significant activity
of this compound has encouraged great interest in
synthesising the compound and total synthesis of this drug
has been achieved [197-201].
steganacin
steganacin (93) and a number of related compounds were
first isolated from the stems and stem bark of the east
african tree steganotaenia araliacea [202]. it inhibits
mitosis, competitively inhibits the binding of colchicine to
tubulin and inhibits tubulin polymerization [203]. it has
been reported to bind to tubulin with similar affinity to that
of colchicines [204].

on tubulin [214]. this drug has also been reported to have a
reversible disruptive effect on mitotic spindle microtubule
organization during maturation [215].

 xxxd28xxx  and its derivatives
 xxxd28xxx  ( xxxd26xxx ) (94), the major endogenous
mammalian metabolite of the primary estrogenic hormone betaestradiol, was reported to have cytotoxic effect [205-207]. it
has shown cytotoxicity to several tumor cell lines, binding
to the colchicine site of tubulin resulting in the formation of
abnormal mts [208]. it also inhibits angiogenesis [209] and
it has been postulated that  xxxd28xxx  perturbs
mitotic activity by altering the dynamics of tubulin
polymerization [210].

sulfonamides
among sulfonamides, e7010 (102) is the most active
antimitotic agent, which has been shown to inhibit mt
formation by binding at the site of colchicines [216]. it is
quite soluble in water as an acid salt. this drug showed
good results against a wide range of tumor cells including
vinca alkaloid resistant solid tumors [41]. results from
animal studies have indicated activity against colorectal,
breast and lung cancer tissues [217]. it is not very potent in
vitro, with an ic50 value of 0.45 µg/ml against colon 38,
which is about 100-fold less active than  xxxd1744xxx  a4.
however, it showed good efficacy against rodent solid
tumors and a wide range of human xenografts [218].
compound 103, having a dibenzodiazo group, was the
second antimitotic compound in this series. it is two to
three-fold more potent than e7010 against various human
tumor cell lines in vitro [219]. introducing a pyridivinyl
group in place of phenylamino group of e7010 yielded a
series of potent antimitotic agents represented by 54. this
compound is 145 times more potent in vitro than e7010
against colon 38 cells and is efficacious in the mouse model
against colon 26 cells [220]. n- (3-chloro-7-indoyl)-1,4benzenesulfonamide, e7070), compound 105, blocked the
cell cycle progression in g1 phase but not m phase and
showed significant antitumor activity against hct116
human colon carcinoma both in vitro (ic50 0.11 µg/ml in
cell proliferation assay) and in vivo [221]. it has also been
reported that tumor cells exposed to e7070 have been found
to accumulate at the g1 phase without binding to tubulin
[222]. for that reason, e7070 is not categorised as an
antimitotic agent, but rather as a cytostatic agent acting on

 xxxd26xxx  inhibited beta-fgf (fibroblast growth factor) and
vegf ( xxxg2413xxx )-induced
neovascularization by 39% and 54% respectively,
comparable to paclitaxel [211] this compound also showed
binding both to unpolymerized and polymerized tubulin
[212]. a series of structurally related compounds were
synthesized and some compounds (95-99) were more potent
than  xxxd26xxx  as cytotoxic agents in cancer cell cultures and as
tubulin polymerization inhibitors. the active compounds
contained either an ethoxy or a propenyl moiety at the 2position and /or oxime groups at the 6-position [132]. based
on the hypothetical relationship between the structure of
colchicine and  xxxd28xxx , a b-ring expanded 2ethoxyestradiol analogue (100) was synthesized in which the
b-ring of the steroid was replaced by the b-ring of
colchicine and was found to accelerate tubulin
polymerization and stabilize the mts towards cold-induced
depolymerization that was produced by paclitaxel [213].
diethylstilbsterol
 xxxd1880xxx  (101), a synthetic estrogen used in the
treatment of abortion, was found to induce cervical and
vaginal tumors. this compound has been reported to cause
depolymerization of mts and binding to the colchicine site

reported as an inhibitor of the binding of both colchicine and
 xxxd2980xxx  to tubulin [228]. this compound inhibits
paclitaxel mediated polymerization of mts at micromolar
concentrations [132]. chelidonine (109), isolated from
chelidonium majus, is related to sanguinarine (108) and has
been noted to have antimitotic activity [229]. another
structurally similar compound chelerythrine (110) has also
been reported to inhibit both colchicine and  xxxd2980xxx 
from binding to tubulin in higher concentrations [160].

t138067, a synthetic compound (2-fluoro-1-methoxy-4pentafluorophenyl-sulfonamidobenzene) (106) has been
reported to modify tubulin covalently at the cys-239 residue
of the  xxxg2353xxx  isotypes, shared by the  xxxg836xxx ,  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx , and beta4
tubulin isotypes and thereby disrupt mt polymerization
[101]. the investigators found that t138067, in contrast to
other known alkylating agents [224-226], significantly
prevented the binding of colchicine to tubulin. this
compound exhibited cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines
that exhibit resistance to  xxxd3511xxx , paclitaxel,
doxorubicin, and  xxxd1800xxx  d. it showed equal effect
against multi-drug resistance human tumor xenografts in
athynic nude mice. the authors suggested that this
compound might be clinically useful for the treatment of
human cancers that have developed resistance to standard
chemotherapeutic agents [224]

quinolones and derivatives
2-phenyl-4-quinolones (pq)
synthesized quinolones (111), the amino analogs of
cytotoxic antimitotic flavonoids have been reported to have
antimitotic/antitumor activity [230-232]. a series of 2-aryl4-quinolones were synthesized and evaluated for their
interaction with tubulin, including inhibition of tubulin
polymerization and colchicine binding to tubulin and
cytotoxicity in vitro against some tumor cell lines [132].

rotenone (107)

1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-phenyl-4-quinones

a natural 6-deoxyclitoriacetal product that has been
extracted from clitoria macrophyllia, is used in thailand as
a traditional medicine for controlling pests and skin diseases
[227]. it has also been reported as a potent antimitotic agent
which interacts with the colchicine-binding site. this drug is
reported to have been used in combination with  xxxd3511xxx 
[160].

these compounds are another class of quinolone type
drugs that have been identified as antimitotic agents.
reduction of the double bond at the 2,3 –position led to a
new series of 2,3-dihydro-2-pheny-l-4- (1h)-quinolones
(dhpq, 101-104) which showed potent antimitotic and
antitumor activity [132]. 2,3-dihydro-2- (aryl)-4- (1h)quinazolinones (dhqz, compounds 116-118) derived by the
reduction of the double bond at the 2,3-position together
with replacement of c (3) by a nitrogen [11], were shown to
have antitumor activity [233,234]. their tubulin inhibition
activity has been identified [235,236]. compound 69, a 2strylquinazolin-4 (3h)-one (sqz) derivative has been shown

mini-reviews in medicinal chemistry, 2004, vol. 4, no. 10 1091

to have antimitotic activity [237,238]. structure-activity
relationship studies of quinolone derivatives led to the
discovery of a particularly potent compound, nsc 664171
(120), which showed inhibitory activity against tubulin
polymerization and radiolabeled colchicine binding to
tubulin, suggesting that these compounds are colchicine site
binding tubulin inhibitors [132]. this compound also
exhibited strong cytotoxic effects against most human tumor
cell lines with gi 5 0 values in the nanomolar or
subnanomolar concentration range [231].

alkylamino in position 12 were synthesized and evaluated
for both tubulin polymerization and cytostatic activity in
mda-mb 231 and mcf-7 human breast cancer cells. 6alkyl-12-formyl-5,6-dihydroindolo[2,1-a]isoquinolines, typified by the compounds 125 and 126, have been shown to
inhibit the growth of human mammary carcinoma cells by
an unknown mode of action [240]. highest activity was
found for the (+)-isomers of 6-propyl- and 6-butyl-12formyl-5,6-hydro-3,9-dihydroxyindolo[2,1-a]isoquinoline with
ic 50 values of 11 ±0.4 and 3.1 ± 0.4 µm, respectively for
the polymerization of tubulin at 37°c [240]. the experiment
also showed that hydroxy-substitute indolo[2,1a]isoquinolines bind to the colchicine binding site and
inhibit the polymerization of tubulin [240]. 3-formyl-6methoxy-2- (4-methoxyphenyl)indoles, typified by 2phenylindoles derivative 1 2 7 , inhibited tubulin
polymerization and cell growth inhibition with ic50 values
of 1.5 µm and 35nm respectively [241].

2-aryl-napthyridinones
synthetic derivatives of 2-aryl-napthyridinones,e.g., 2(-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,8-napthyridin-4 (1h)-one (122),
showed potent cytotoxic effects sagainst prostate and breast
cancer cell lines and inhibition of tubulin assembly and
radiolabeled colchicine binding to tubulin [132]. this
compound has also been reported to have 100-fold greater
activity than the corresponding 2- (-3-methoxyphenyl)-4quinolone (1 2 1 ) [132]. substituted 2-thienyl-1, 8napthyridin-4-ones, typified by 123, showed significant
cytotoxic effect (log gi50<-4.0) against a range of human
tumor cell lines. among these compounds only 124 was a
potent inhibitor of the binding of radiolabeled colchicine to
tubulin and it was the most cytotoxic and effective inhibitor
of tubulin polymerization [239].

benzoylureas
among benzoylureas (128-131), 3- (iodoacetamido)benzoylurea (3-iaabu) (128), a synthetic compound with a
much smaller molecular weight than those isolated from
natural sources, exhibited anticancer activity in a variety of
tumor cell lines with id90 in the range of 0.015-0.29 µm for
leukemic cells and 0.06-0.92 µm for solid tumors by
inhibiting microtubule assembly [242]. the mechanism of
inhibition was similar to that of  xxxd2745xxx  [243]. of the
four (128-131) compounds, bromine (130) and iodine (128)
derivatives showed strong antimicrotubular activities. the
primary action of these compounds is to bind at or near the

chloroethylurea (ceu,132)

indanosine (135)

although the mechanism of ceu cytotoxicity is
unknown, evidence was provided that 1-aryl-3- (2chloroethyl) ureas, a novel class of mild alkylating agents,
prevented microtubule depolymerization through alkylation
of cys239 residue of  xxxg2353xxx  near the colchicine binding
site [244]. among a series of ceu derivatives, compound
ceu showed potent cytotoxicity in cho-tax 5-6 with
ic50 value of 4.6± 0.3 µm) [244].

a cytostatic and cytotoxic indanone, potentially
inhibited the tubulin polymerization in-vitro and disrupted
the mitotic apparatus in dividing cells [251]. this drug
arrested the growth of multidrug-sensitive cancer cells at the
g 2/m phase and induced apoptotic cell death in stationary
phase cells at concentrations that do not impair the viability
of normal nonproliferating cells [251]. indanosine interacts
with tubulin at the colchicine-binding site and inhibits
tubulin polymerization with an ic50 value equivalent to
values obtained with  xxxd2980xxx  and  xxxd1744xxx  a4 [252]. the investigator suggested that indanosine and
related indones may be considered as lead compounds for the
development of chemotherapeutic strategies for drug-resistant
malignancies.

ly290181 (133)
2-amino-4- (3-pyridyl)-4h-napthol (1,2-b)pyran-3carbonitrile, a potent antimitotic agent for a variety of cell
types, is mediated by binding to a novel site of tubulin
[245] and suppressing the dynamics of mitotic spindle
microtubules or tubulin polymerization [246]. cell cycle
analysis showed that ly290181 caused accumulation of
smooth muscle cells at the g2/m phase and induced mitotic
arrest in chinese hamster ovary cells and hela cells [246].
the potency of this compound was comparable to known
anti-microtubule compounds such as colchicine or
 xxxd3511xxx  [247]. this compound was also found to inhibit
vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation [248] and to reduce
diabetic-induced endothelial cell dysfunction including
blood flow and vascular permeability [249] . (-)phenylahistatin (134), isolated from aspergillus ustus,
showed cyototoxic and cell cycle inhibitory activities during
g 2 /m phase. this fungal diketopiperazine metabolite
composed of phenylalanine and dedydrohistidine is reported

benzothiophene compounds
another type of tubulin polymerization inhibitors were
discovered based on the 3-aryol-2-arylbenzo[b]thiophene
molecular skeleton. the most promising compound was 2(4'-methoxyphenyl)-3-(3',4',5'-trimethoxybenzoyl)-6-methoxybenzo[b]thiophene (136), which interacts with tubulin at
colchicine binding site and showed significant human cancer
cell growth inhibitory activity (gi50<10mg/ml) [253].
 xxxd2745xxx  (137)

two natural classes of antimitotic agent isolated from the
indian plant ottelia alimoides, are effective inhibitors of
tubulin polymerization (ic50 = 1.2 µm) and are able to
disassemble preformed microtubules [254]. compound 138,
5-fold more active than compound 139, prevented colchicine
binding but not  xxxd3511xxx  binding which indicated that
these compounds bind to or near the specific colchicine
binding site [254].
compound (140), a temperature dependent potent
inhibitor of tubulin polymerization that exerts its

cytotoxicity through interaction at the colchicine site,
demonstrated highest activity with ic50 value of 11.8 µm
over the temperature range of 30-37°c [255]. this is a new
approach developing anticancer drugs.

solid tumors in vitro [256]. studies suggested that tps may
interact with tubulin at the colchicine binding site to inhibit
mt assembly without disrupting the binding sites for gtp

alone cannot inhibit mt assembly [262]. most of the
semisynthetic or totally synthetic vinca alkaloids drugs have
been developed by the modification of c-4, c-23, c-3' and
c-4' position of parent vinca alkaloids [132].

1b.ii: vinca alkaloid site binding drugs
 xxxd3513xxx  (144)

vinca alkaloids, vincristine (142) and  xxxd3511xxx  (143),
are the most useful class of antimitotic anticancer agents for
the treatment of leukemias, lymphomas and some solid
tumors [259]. these agents, isolated from the madagasker
periwinkle catharanthus roseus, are widely used as
anticancer drugs. vinca alkaloids prevent mt assembly by
binding to tubulin at a site distinct from colchicine and by
blocking the region involved in heterodimer attachment
[260] . vinca alkaloids bind to tubulin at gtp site that is
located at both the alpha and beta - subunits with primary
sequences around alpha-339 and beta-390 residues [261]. unlike
colchicine, vinca alkaloids bind to tubulin rapidly,
reversibly and temperature independently [125,136]. the
sar, pharmacology and clinical uses of vinca alkaloids
have been reviewed [132, 160]. after the establishment of
vinca alkaloids as promising anticancer agents, efforts have
been made to develop new congeners that are more effective,
have less side effects and have a broad spectrum of antitumor
activity. the basic structure of vinca alkaloids is composed
of a catharenthine moiety and vindoline moiety and these

me

the first semisynthetic vinca alkaloid, was developed by
changing the c-23 acetyl group in  xxxd3511xxx  to an amide
[132]. modifying the vindoline moiety with  xxxd3454xxx 
at c-23 led to the development of vintripole (145) which is
in clinical trial [263,264]. some of its derivatives (146-148)
were found to inhibit tubulin polymerization [265]. the sisomers were more active [132].
vinxaltin (149) is in phase ii clinical trial for advanced
breast cancer and s-epimer showed more activity than the repimer [266]. another semisynthetic compound  xxxd3515xxx   xxxd3516xxx 
(150) [267] showed promising activity against breast cancer
[268, 269] and is in clinical trial for the treatment of other
types of tumors [270] . this drug showed superior
antimitotic activity over others with lower reversible
neurotoxicity [270-272]. further modifications in  xxxd3515xxx   xxxd3516xxx 
led to the discovery of vinflunin (151) which showed
significantly superior anticancer activity in vivo as compared
to  xxxd3515xxx   xxxd3516xxx  [273,274].

microtubulin binding sites as target for developing anticancer agents

other vinca alkaloid site binding drugs
dolastatin and its derivatives
the most promising is  xxxd1925xxx  (152), a natural
compound isolated from the sea hare dolabella auricularia
in 1987. this drug and its related compound dolastatin-15
(153) are novel pentapeptides which exhibit powerful
antimitotic properties [275]. they are potent inhibitors of
tubulin, acting as noncompititive inhibitors of  xxxd3511xxx 
binding to tubulin [276].  xxxd1925xxx  is 9 times more
potent than dolastatin-15 and both are more potent than
 xxxd3511xxx  [277].  xxxd1925xxx  & 15 (with ic50 values of
0.13 to 1.3 pm and 1.3 to 13 pm respectively) are 1000 to
10,000 times more effective than vincristine on various
human lymphoma cell lines [278]. dolastatin10 and 15
showed the most promising antimitotic activity and both
have entered clinical trial. earlier, the discovery of dolastatin
3-15 had been reviewed [279] and sar, synthesis and
pharmacological properties of these agents have been
described [280].
cemadotin (154), a water soluble pentapeptide analogue
of dolastatin15, is in phase ii clinical trials for metastatic
melanoma and other solid tumors [281,282]. cemadotin
showed good activity against a broad range of murine and
human tumors with ic50 values typically in pm range [283].
it also showed excellent efficacy in a number of xenograft
and synergeneic tumor models [284]. compound 155 has
oral bioavailability with similar in vivo and slightly reduced
in vitro activity when compared to cemadotin [285].
cryptophysin analogues (156-160)
cryptophysin 1 (156), a  xxxd1841xxx  isolated from the
cyanobacterium nostoc sp [286], is a potent antimitotic
agent having 100 to 1000-fold greater activity than paclitaxel
and  xxxd3511xxx  which induces cell death by apoptosis [287].

mini-reviews in medicinal chemistry, 2004, vol. 4, no. 10 1095

this drug does not appear to be a substrate for the pglycoprotein multidrug transporter [288]. cryptophysin
analogues have been synthesized [289-291] and cryptophysin
52 (157) showed the most potent antimitotic activity acting
to suppress spindle microtubule dynamics [292]. it blocks
cell cycle progression at g2/m phase at lower concentration,
causes accumulation of cells at metaphase and kills cells by
apoptosis [292]. it demonstrated potent antiproliferative
activity in both solid and hematologic tumor cell lines
including mdr phenotypes with ic50 values in the low
picomolar range which is significantly lower than paclitaxel
or  xxxd3511xxx  [293] . the synthesised c-6 substituted
spirocyclopropyl compound (160) has excellent antitumor
activity in animal models with ic50 value of 0.014nm
[294].
 xxxd3511xxx -2 and derivatives (161-163)
 xxxd3511xxx -2 (3'-chloroethyl)-2',4'-dioxo-3,5'-spiro-oxazolidino-4-deacetoxy- xxxd3511xxx , a bis-indol compound, showed
antitimor activity with lower toxicity than vinca alkaloids.
its antimitotic activity was due to inhibition of tubulin
assembly [295]. although it binds to calmodulin, in contrast
to  xxxd3511xxx , it does not exhibit anti-calmodulin activity
[296]. it was effective in the mouse leukemia p388 test in
vivo without significant toxicity [296].  xxxd3511xxx -3 (162), and
 xxxd3511xxx -4 (163), two derivatives of  xxxd3511xxx , also inhibit tubulin
assembly.  xxxd3511xxx  derivatives displayed their cytotoxic activity
at significantly higher concentrations than the mother
compounds, although their antimicrotubular activities were
similar in vitro [296].
ikp-104 (164)

into spiral filaments [297]. this compound also accelerates
the decay of tubulin [298].

spongistatin
these complex macrocyclic lactone compounds (168176), isolated from the spirastrilla spinispirulifera, have
been reported to display potent cytotoxicity with ic50 value
of 10 µg/ml [304]. spongistatins showed inhibitory activity
against binding of vincristine [305] and dolastatin to tubulin
[306]. spongistatin i (168), isolated from an eastern indian
ocean sponge hyrtios erecta [307], has been docked in to
the 3-d atomic model of the alphabeta-heterodimer. it was found
that the putative spongistatin binding pocket consists of an
unusual cluster of 10 aromatic residues situated in close
proximity that includes y 108, w 103, y 185, w 407, f
399, f 404, f 395, f 418 and h 408 [308]. this compound
has also been reported to exert broad spectrum antifungal
properties following antimicrotubule activity [309]. a novel
synthetic spiroketal pyran, spiket-p (177) was later
rationally designed as a pharmacophore for spongistatin,
resulting in tubulin depolymerization in cell free turbidity
assays, prevention of mitotic spindle formation, destruction

pironetin and derivatives (165-167)
pironetin (165) [299,300] and demethylpironetin (166)
[301] produced potent tubulin assembly inhibition by
arresting the cell cycle in m phase (g2 /m) and showing
antitumor activity against amurine tumor cell line p338
leukemia, transplanted in mice, with ic50 value 15 µm. the
antitumor activity of these compounds is due to apoptosis
caused by the phosphorylation of bcl-2 and by mitotic arrest
[302] . epoxypironetin (167), a derivative of pironatin,
showed very weak activity. pironetin (165) was found to
inhibit the binding of  xxxd3511xxx  to tubulin. the affinity of
pironetin to tubulin is higher than that of  xxxd3511xxx  [302].
important structural features for mt inhibitory activity of
165 were found to be alphabeta-unsaturated lactones with chirality
at the c-7 position bearing a hydroxyl group and the
terminal portion of the alkyl chain [303].

of the mt organization and induction of apoptosis in human
breast cancer cell at subnanomolar concentrations [308].
docking studies revealed that, when bound to tubulin, the
spiroketal ring of spiket-p (177) would be situated
between aromatic residues f 404 and w 407 in the binding
pocket and would provide favorable hydrophobic interactions
and van der waals contacts with these residues [308].

and prevents tubulin spirilization [314].
ustiloxins (180-184), a family of four cyclic peptides,
isolated from the water extract of false smut balls on rice
panicles caused by the fungus ustilaginoidea virens, have
been found to strongly inhibit the formation of mts
[315,316] . ustiloxin a (180), the most potent member of
the family shows similar biological activity to rhizoxin and
prevents mitosis at concentrations below 1 µg/ml [317].
ustiloxin a (180), b (181), c (182), d (183) and f (185)
have shown ic 50 values of 1.0, 1.8, 2.5, & 10.3 µm
respectively [318].

rhizoxin (178), isolated from the fungus rhizopus
chinensis, an antifungal agent, has antimitotic activity.
although there is some controversy over the exact binding
site of this compound it may be regarded as a vinca alkaloid
site binding drug because it can affect the binding of vinca
alkaloids to tubulin [310]. this compound has been reported
to be effective against many human cancer cell lines and
some vinca alkaloids resistant tumors [311].

phankella carteri, has been reported to arrest cell growth at
subnanomolar concentrations. this compound, which has
been synthesized, and its related compound halistatin (189)
are noncompetitive inhibitors of the binding of both
vincristine and  xxxd3511xxx  to tubulin [160].

compounds inhibit mt assembly by interacting with certain
sulfhydryl groups which can be considered as the target for
these compounds. the reactivity of these groups with
tubulin ligands makes them excellent probes for the
interaction of tubulin with ligands. sulfhydryl directed
reagents that prevent mt formation may also be classified as
antimitotic agents. some ligands having antimitotic activity
are illustrated below.

hemistarlins (186-187)
these compounds, isolated from the marine sponge
cymbastela sp., show potent inhibitory activity against the
p338 cell line with ic50 value 0.4ng/ml [320].

n,n’-ethylenebis (iodoacetamide) (192) is a bifunctional
agent that interacts with tubulin by forming cross-links
between sulfhydryl groups of tubulin and thereby prevents
assembly of tubulin into microtubules [328]. this drug is a
specific sulfhydryl directed reagent that is being used
extensively in various experiments to ascertain the nature
and function of sulfhydryl groups of tubulin.

drugs binding with other sites:
maps
 xxxd2042xxx  (emp, 190) [321], a synthetic
antimitotic agent, has been found to alter dynamic stability
of mts by binding to the maps, specifically  xxxg1360xxx . this
compound also caused drug induced apoptosis in the human
malignant glioma cell line [322]. oral emp in combination
with etoposide is a treatment regimen for patients with
hormone-refractory prostate cancer and thereby deserves
further investigation [323]. clinical evaluation of this drug
and  xxxd3511xxx  in patients with hormone-refractory prostate
cancer has also been reported [324].

calvatic acid (1 9 3 ), an antibiotic and cytostatic
compound isolated from calvatica liacina [329,330],
prevents microtubules assembly by binding with sh groups
of tubulin [160]. it has been reported that chloro derivative
(194) of this compound is more active and prevented the
binding of colchicine to tubulin [331].
methylmercury (mehg) specifically promotes the
depolymerisation of mt and inhibits cell proliferation in
mouse glioma cells [332]. the disruption of mt by mehg
results in the inhibition of the synthesis of tubulin through
autoregulatory repression in posttranscriptional process as in
the case of colchicine. it has been reported that mehg
depolymerises mt by binding to sulfhydryl groups in the
tubulin subunit and increases the pool size of unpolymerised
tubulin subunit [333]. it is suggested that mehg is capable
of depressing tubulin synthesis through the increase of
unpolymerised tubulin subunits by mt disruption [332].

motor proteins
 xxxd2666xxx  (191) arrested cells in mitosis by binding to
kinesin  xxxg1276xxx , a motor protein that is essential for production
of a bipolar spindle.  xxxd2666xxx  inhibits the  xxxg1276xxx  driven
microtubule motility with an ic50 value of 14 µm [325]. it
was suggested that this drug, with limited clinical benefits,
would be useful as a tool for studying mitotic mechanism.
drugs binding to sulfhydryl groups

drugs that bind to an unknown site of tubulin

the sulfhydryl groups of tubulin are highly reactive
entities, especially a thiol group on cysteine residues.
tubulin has 20 cysteine residues, of which 12 are in the alphatubulin and 8 in the  xxxg2353xxx  subunit [326,327]. these
cysteines can be exploited to study the conformational
changes of tubulin by binding with ligands. some

fr 182877 (195)
a new hexacyclic antimitotic compound isolated from
the culture broth of streptomycis sp. no. 9885 [334],
exhibited potent antimitotic activity with ic50 value of 600

in vivo [335].

the synthetic compounds showed more potency than that of
natural products [338].

tryphostin ag-1714 (196) and several other related
compounds have been reported to disrupt microtubules (ic50
= 1-10 µm) in a variety of cancer cell lines. these agents do
not affect the polymerization or stability of microtubules in
vitro, which implies that the effect on microtubules is
indirect. however, microtubules disassembly induced by
ag1714, was blocked by paclitaxel. the authors also
revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation is involved in the
regulation of microtubules dynamics [336].

dz3358 (201), a pyrimidinyl  xxxd3045xxx  derivative,
exhibited potent antiproliferative activity against several
cancer cell lines in vitro and antitumor activity in vivo [339].
although the mechanism of action is unclear it has been
found to cause cell cycle arrest in g2/m phase and to block
tubulin polymerization [340]. the inhibitory effect of this
drug on tubulin polymerisation was as potent as that of
colchine whereas the antiproliferative activities were weak
[340].

tryprostatins (197-200)

moroidin (202), a bicyclic ring system isolated from the
seeds of celosia argentea (amaranthaceae), has been
reported to strongly inhibit the polymerisation of tubulin
[341]. the seeds of this chinese herbal medicine are used in
the treatment of eye and hepatic diseases in china and japan
[342,343]. the inhibitory activity (ic50 value of 3.0 µm) of
the tubulin polymerisation by moroidin was more potent
that of colchicine (ic50 value of 10 µm) whereas the
hydrolysate compound of moroidin showed less activity

tryprostatin a (197), the first natural diketopiperazine
alkaloid isolated from the aspergillus fumigates, inhibits
microtubule assembly by interfering with the interaction
between maps and the c-terminal domain of tubulin and
inhibits cell cycle progression at the m phase by disrupting
microtubule spindle [337]. tryprostatin b (198) showed cell
cycle nonspecific inhibition on cell growth. 198 and
demethoxyfumitremorgin c (199) have been synthesised and

than the parent compound but was comparable to colchicines
[344].
deuterium oxide (d2o), a modulator of mt dynamics,
is known to promote the assembly of tubulin into mts in
vitro to increase the volume of mitotic spindle and the
number and length of mts spindles [345]. the mechanism
responsible for the ability of d2o to stabilise mt dynamic
may involve the enhancement of hydrophobic interaction in
the mt lattice and/or the substitution of deuterium bonds
for hydrogen bonds [345]. d2o may inhibit cell proliferation
during interphase by stabilising the interphase mt
cytoskeleton [345] or prevent disassembly that is a
prerequisite for the formation of mitotic spindles.
