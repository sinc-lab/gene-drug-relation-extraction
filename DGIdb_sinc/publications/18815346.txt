depress the activity of brain stem respiratory-related neurons, but it is
not resolved whether the mechanism at clinical concentrations consists of direct neuronal effects or network effects. we performed
extracellular recordings of discharge activity of single respiratory
neurons in the caudal ventral respiratory group of decerebrate dogs,
which were premotor neurons with a likelihood of 90%. we used
multibarrel glass microelectrodes, which allowed concomitant highly
localized picoejection of opioid receptor agonists or antagonists onto
the neuron. picoejection of the ␮ receptor agonist [d-ala2, n-mephe4, gly-ol5]-enkephalin (damgo, 1 mm) decreased the peak
discharge frequency (mean ⫾ sd) of expiratory neurons to 68 ⫾ 22%
(n ⫽ 12), the ␦1 agonist d-pen2,5-enkephalin (dpdpe, 1 mm) to 95 ⫾
11% (n ⫽ 15), and ␦2 receptor agonist [d-ala2] deltorphin-ii to 86 ⫾
17% (1 mm, n ⫽ 15). the corresponding values for inspiratory
neurons were: 64 ⫾ 12% (n ⫽ 11), 48 ⫾ 30% (n ⫽ 12), and 75 ⫾
15% (n ⫽ 11), respectively. naloxone fully reversed these effects.
picoejection of morphine (0.01–1 mm) depressed most neurons in a
concentration dependent fashion to maximally 63% (n ⫽ 27). picoejection of  xxxd3094xxx  (240 – 480 nm) did not cause any significant
depression of inspiratory (n ⫽ 11) or expiratory neurons (n ⫽ 9). 4.
intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  (0.2– 0.6 ␮g 䡠 kg⫺1 䡠 min⫺1) decreased neuronal peak discharge frequency to 60 ⫾ 12% (inspiratory, n ⫽ 7) and
58 ⫾ 11% (expiratory, n ⫽ 11). however, local picoejection of
naloxone did not reverse the neuronal depression. our data suggest
that ␮, ␦1, and ␦2 receptors are present on canine respiratory premotor
neurons. clinical concentrations of morphine and  xxxd3094xxx  caused
no local depression. this lack of effect and the inability of local
naloxone to reverse the neuronal depression by intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  suggest that clinical concentrations of opioids produce their
depressive effects on mechanisms upstream from respiratory bulbospinal premotor neurons.

opioid agonists such as morphine, fentanyl, and  xxxd3094xxx 
are potent clinical analgesics and respiratory depressants. the
respiratory depressant effects are thought to be mainly due to
␮ receptor activation although depression by ␦ opioid receptor
activation has also been implicated (sales et al. 1985). neurons
expressing opioid receptors have been identified throughout the
respiratory system. for example, ␮ and ␦ opioid receptors have
been pharmacologically (denavit-saubie et al. 1978; morinsurun et al. 1984) and immunohistochemically (haji et al.

2003b) identified on feline respiratory neurons, where they are
differentially distributed either predominantly on the soma,
e.g., in most bulbospinal premotor neurons, or on the dendrites
(haji et al. 2003b). several studies have shown that clinical (haji
et al. 2003a; lalley 2003) and/or pharmacological (denavitsaubie et al. 1978; lalley 2003; morin-surun et al. 1984)
concentrations of fentanyl and morphine cause depression of
various types of respiratory neurons in vivo via both direct and
indirect mechanisms. however, it remains unresolved whether
clinically relevant concentrations of opioids exert their effect
via network effects or via direct effects on specific respiratory
neurons in the brain stem.
we investigated this question for respiratory bulbospinal
neurons in a decerebrate dog model that allows us to study the
effects of synaptic neurotransmitters and pharmacological agonists or antagonists on functionally identified single respiratory
neurons in vivo under physiologically relevant conditions without confounding background anesthesia(tonkovic-capin et al.
1998). in this model, inspiratory and expiratory bulbospinal
premotor neurons are the major source of excitatory drive
(dogas et al. 1995; krolo et al. 1999, 2000) for inspiratory and
expiratory motoneurons, which directly activate the respiratory
musculature and may thus be direct or indirect targets of
clinical opioid effects.
as a first step we sought to determine whether ␮ and ␦
opioid receptors were present on canine respiratory premotor
neurons. we investigated whether selective ␮ and ␦ opioid
agonists had direct and reversible depressant effects on these
neurons in vivo as well as the maximum effect for each
agonist. once the presence of functional opioid receptors was
established, we investigated with similar protocols whether
picoejection of the clinical ␮ opioid agonists morphine and
 xxxd3094xxx  had a direct depressant effect on premotor neurons
and whether the doses necessary to achieve neuronal depression were in a plasma concentration range that can be expected
during clinical use. morphine was chosen because of its frequent clinical use and to allow comparison of our model with
multiple studies in other in vivo and in vitro preparations.
 xxxd3094xxx  was chosen to allow direct comparison with the
subsequent protocol using intravenous  xxxd3094xxx . with the
last protocol, we investigated whether the significant depression of respiratory premotor neurons that is caused by clinical
dose rates of intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  resulted at least in part
from a direct opioid effect. we used the clinical ␮ opioid
agonist  xxxd3094xxx  because the pharmacokinetics of this drug

clinical opioids and respiratory premotor neurons

allowed achievement of a steady-state global respiratory depression with intravenous infusion and then a quick recovery to
baseline conditions for postremifentanil control runs. the fast
and complete metabolism of the drug also allowed multiple
protocols in the same animal without confounding effects of
residual systemic opioids.
methods

this research was approved by the subcommittee on animal studies
of the zablocki veterans affairs medical center, milwaukee, wi, in
accordance with provisions of the animal welfare act, the phs
guide for the care and use of laboratory animals, and va policy.
experiments were performed on mongrel dogs of either sex, weighing
from 8 to 16 kg. inhalational anesthesia was induced by mask and
maintained with isoflurane at 1.5–2.5% end-tidal concentration. the
animals were monitored for signs of inadequate anesthesia such as
salivation, lacrimation, and increases in blood pressure and heart rate.
if required, anesthetic depth was increased immediately.

surgical procedures
the trachea of dogs was intubated with a cuffed endotracheal tube,
and their lungs were mechanically ventilated with an air-o2-isoflurane
mixture. the surgical procedures, monitoring, and maintenance of
body homeostasis have been previously described in detail (dogas
et al. 1998). briefly, after cannulating the femoral artery for blood
pressure recording and blood gas sampling and femoral vein for
continuous infusion of maintenance fluids and administration of
drugs, a bilateral pneumothorax was performed to reduce motion
artifacts. the animal was then decerebrated by midcollicular transection (tonkovic-capin et al. 1998), and isoflurane was discontinued.
after decerebration, the animal was ventilated with an air-o2 mixture
and maintained in hyperoxic normocapnia (fio2 ⬎0.6). the dorsal
surface of the medulla oblongata was exposed by an occipital craniotomy for neuronal recording. phrenic nerve activity was recorded
from the desheathed right c5 rootlet. the phrenic neurogram (png)
was obtained from the moving-time average (100 ms) of the amplified
phrenic nerve activity and was used to produce timing pulses corresponding to the beginning and end of the inspiratory phase. continuous neuromuscular block was achieved with pancuronium (0.1
mg 䡠 kg⫺1 䡠 h⫺1) to reduce motion artifacts during neuronal recordings.

picoejection technique and neuronal recording
a minimum of 1 h was allowed for preparation stabilization before
data collection. extracellular single-unit recordings from caudal ventral respiratory group (vrg) neurons were obtained using multibarrel
micropipettes (10 –30 ␮m composite tip diameter) consisting of a
recording barrel containing a 7-␮m-thick carbon filament and three
drug barrels. we have shown in previous studies that ⬎90% of
antidromically tested inspiratory (bajic et al. 1992; stuth et al. 1994)
and expiratory (bajic et al. 1992) neurons in the caudal and intermediate vrg from where we sampled neurons were bulbospinal premotor neurons. the microelectrodes allowed extracellular recordings of
neuronal action potentials before and during pressure ejection of
picomolar amounts of opioid agonists or the opioid antagonist naloxone onto the neuron. the ejected solutions consisted of artificial
cerebrospinal fluid (acsf) and one of the following agents that was
dissolved in acsf at a 1 mm concentration: the ␮ receptor agonist
[d-ala2, n-me-phe4, gly-ol5]-enkephalin (damgo), the ␦1 agonist
2,5
2
d-pen -enkephalin (dpdpe), the ␦2 agonist [d-ala ]-deltorphin ii
(deltorphin ii), or the nonselective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. the acsf consisted of (in mm) 124 nacl, 2 kcl, 2 mgcl, 1.3
kh2po4, 0.9 cacl2, 26 nahco3, and 11 glucose. similarly, the ␮
receptor agonist  xxxd2670xxx  was dissolved in acsf in concenj neurophysiol • vol

2879

trations of 10 ␮m, 100 ␮m, and 1 mm, and the ␮ agonist  xxxd3094xxx 
was dissolved in acsf in concentrations of 240 and 480 nm. because
 xxxd3094xxx  was only available from one source, the final solutions
also contained 10 and 20 ␮m glycine. the picoejected dose rate was
measured via height changes of the meniscus in the pipette barrel with
a ⫻50 magnification microscope equipped with a reticule (resolution:
⬃2 nl). the picoejection technique has been described in detail by
dogas et al. (1998) and krolo et al. (1999). the location of the
recorded neurons was in a region extending from 1 to 5 mm caudal to
the obex, 2.5– 4.5 mm lateral to the midline and 2– 4.5 mm below the
dorsal medullary surface. a distance of ⱖ500 ␮m was required
between picoejection sites to ensure that results were not confounded
by residual drug effects (⬍0.3% of barrel concentration for a 10 nl
injection) (nicholson 1985). a time-amplitude window discriminator
was used to generate a standard logic pulse for each spike. neuronal
discharge frequency, fn, was continuously determined by the number
of discharges in each 100-ms time increment.

protocols
1. picoejection of subtype specific opioid receptor agonists
onto single neurons: determination of the presence of opioid
receptor subtypes and maximum effect
after establishing a stable recording of single neuron activity, the
neuronal control activity was recorded for ⱖ2– 4 min. then picoejection was started and the dose rate was gradually increased until a
neuronal response was observed. thereafter the dose rates were
increased stepwise until the effects saturated, i.e., an additional increase in dose-rate did not produce any further change in neuronal
activity. to avoid potential cross-contamination from multiple barrels.
only one selective agonist was tested for each neuron protocol. in a
subset of neurons, after maximal effects had been obtained, picoejection of the nonselective opioid antagonist naloxone was used to ensure
that the agonist effects were reversible. in a separate group of neurons,
this antagonist was picoejected without prior agonist application to
determine whether the neurons received any endogenous input
through opioid receptors.

2. picoejection of morphine onto single neurons: assessment
of the threshold concentration for a direct morphine effect
and of the maximum direct morphine effect
in the second set of animals, the prototypic clinical ␮ agonist
morphine was picoejected in increasing dose rates until a ceiling
effect was reached for each of the three concentrations tested. because
the experimental setup has a limit of three drug barrels, we initially
tested only the higher morphine concentrations (100 ␮m and 1 mm).
when we found that the 100 ␮m concentration already led to a
significant neuronal depression, we added experiments with 10 ␮m
morphine to more closely assess the threshold concentration for
neuronal depression. in a subset of neurons, reversibility of the
morphine effect was tested with naloxone. in addition, i.e., at least
once per animal, picoejection of the acsf vehicle was used to verify
that the acsf constituents and ejected volumes were without effect
on single neurons.

3. picoejection of  xxxd3094xxx  onto single neurons:
assessment of a direct depressant effect of clinically
relevant concentrations
in the third set of animals, the clinical ␮ agonist  xxxd3094xxx  was
picoejected in increasing dose rates until a ceiling effect was reached
for each of the two concentrations tested. because  xxxd3094xxx  is only
commercially available as a mixture with glycine, we only tested two
concentrations of  xxxd3094xxx  (240 and 480 nm). these concentrations are ⬃10 –20 times higher than published peak plasma concen-

trations encountered clinically during high-dose intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  infusions. the final glycine concentrations in the picoejected
solution were 10 and 20 ␮m, which is below the effective concentration for in vivo picoejection (0.5–1 mm) (zuperku, unpublished
observations from glycine picoejection experiments). in a subset of
neurons, reversibility of the  xxxd3094xxx  effect was tested with naloxone. in addition, i.e., at least once per animal, picoejection of the
acsf vehicle was used to verify that the acsf constituents and
ejected volumes were with out effect on neuronal frequency.

4. picoejection of the opioid antagonist naloxone onto single
neurons during intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  infusion: does
direct opioid receptor activation on premotor neurons
contribute to the respiratory depression by
systemic  xxxd3094xxx ?
in the last protocol, a stable recording from a single respiratory
bulbospinal neuron was obtained, and baseline activity was recorded.
then an intravenous infusion of the ␮ agonist  xxxd3094xxx  was started
and increased until peak phrenic nerve activity was depressed by
⬇50%. the required doses (0.2– 0.6 ␮g 䡠 kg⫺1 䡠 min⫺1) were in the
clinically used dose range for dogs, which is similar to humans. once
a steady-state depression of peak phrenic activity and neuronal discharge frequency was established for ⱖ5 min, the nonselective opioid
antagonist naloxone was picoejected onto the neuron in increasing
dose rates. dose rates were chosen that had previously completely
reversed the depressant effect of 1 mm damgo picoejected onto a
different premotor neuron in the same animal. any reversal of the
 xxxd3094xxx  induced neuronal depression by local naloxone was
considered evidence of direct postsynaptic neuronal depression of the
neuron. in addition, to assess any endogenous activation of neuronal
opioid receptors, which may confound the determination of direct
 xxxd3094xxx  effect, naloxone was again ejected onto the same neuron
after  xxxd3094xxx  was stopped and neuronal and phrenic nerve activity
had recovered to control levels.

data analysis
cycle-triggered histograms (cths; bin width: 50 ms), triggered
from the onset of either the inspiratory or expiratory phase as defined
by the png, and based on 5–20 respiratory cycles were used to
quantify the neuronal discharge pattern, peak fn and time-averaged fn
during the active neuronal phase. peak fn correlates closely with the
peak excitatory drive transmitted to the phrenic motoneurons, whereas
the average fn allows a better interpretation of the drug effects on the
overall neuronal discharge pattern (eldridge 1975). for peak and
average fn, the values obtained during the preejection control period
were used to normalize the values during the maximum effect of the
respective drug. the main a priori goals of these studies were to
determine the maximum drug effect for each agonist and to determine
whether there were differential effects between inspiratory and expiratory neurons.
statistical procedures were carried out using sigmastat 3.5 (systat
software, richmond, ca). for all data sets, tests for normality of the
normalized data (kolmogorov-smirnov test) were performed before
parametric procedures were used. a two-way anova, with type of
drug and type of neuron as main factors, was used to determine
statistically significant differences for those studies involving the ␮
and ␦ agonists. for the morphine studies with up to three concentrations per neuron, a two-way repeated-measures anova (1-factor
repetition) was used. a general linear model was automatically used
to provide least-squares estimates of the means for cells with missing
data and unbalanced data sets. the holm-sidak method was used for
pairwise multiple comparisons with a family-wide error rate of 0.05.
for one data set that failed the normality test, a kruskal-wallis
one-way anova on ranks was used with dunn’s method for pairwise multiple comparisons.

results

picoejection of subtype specific opioid receptor agonists
onto single neurons: determination of the presence of opioid
receptor subtypes and maximum effect
fifteen animals were used for this protocol. a representative
example of the response to picoejection of increasing dose
rates of the selective ␮ agonist damgo (1 mm) is shown in
fig. 1 for an inspiratory premotor neuron. the inspiratory
neuronal peak discharge frequency fn was depressed from 75
to 50 hz at maximally effective dose-rates of damgo of 67
pmol/min. examples of the cths of inspiratory and expiratory
neuronal responses to damgo, dpdpe, deltorphin ii, and
naloxone are shown in fig. 2, a and b, respectively. figure 2a
shows that all three agonists depressed the peak discharge
frequency of three different inspiratory neurons at maximally
effective dose rates. naloxone fully reversed these effects.
figure 2b suggests that damgo and deltorphin ii are more
depressant than the ␦1 agonist dpdpe (middle cth) in expiratory neurons. the pooled data for both inspiratory and
expiratory neurons are shown in fig. 3, a and b. in inspiratory
neurons, peak fn was decreased by damgo to 64 ⫾ 4%, by
dpdpe to 48 ⫾ 9%, and by deltorphin ii to 75 ⫾ 4% of
control. the corresponding values for time-averaged fn were:
67 ⫾ 5, 46 ⫾ 9, and 71 ⫾ 5% of control (fig. 3b). in six
inspiratory neurons, naloxone was used and was able to fully
reverse the agonist-induced depression.
in expiratory neurons, peak fn was decreased by damgo
to 68 ⫾ 6%, by dpdpe to 95 ⫾ 3%, and by deltorphin ii to
86 ⫾ 4% of control (fig. 3a, top). the corresponding values
for time-averaged fn were 63 ⫾ 8, 93 ⫾ 3, and 86 ⫾ 4% of
control (fig. 3b, bottom). naloxone produced full reversal of
all agonist-induced depressions in those expiratory neurons
that were tested (n ⫽ 21).
in a separate protocol, naloxone was picoejected onto 8
inspiratory and 12 expiratory neurons to assess the presence
of endogenous opioid receptor activation (fig. 4). naloxone
had no significant effect on inspiratory neurons but produced a small, yet statistically significant increase of 13 ⫾
4% in the peak fn and 13 ⫾ 5% in average fn of expiratory
neurons.
picoejection of morphine onto single neurons: assessment
of the threshold concentration for a morphine effect
and of the maximum morphine effect
in this protocol, 27 bulbospinal neurons (15 inspiratory and
12 expiratory) were studied in 13 animals. the anatomical
location of these neurons, based on stereotaxic coordinates, is
shown in fig. 5 and is typical for all of the neuron protocols in
this report. we used up to three concentrations of morphine in
different pipette barrels. the barrel concentrations ranged from
0.01 to 1.0 mm to more precisely delineate the full range of the
dose-dependent effects of morphine on neuronal activity. a

the depressant effects of morphine were completely reversed with local application of naloxone in the three neurons
that we tested with naloxone in this protocol. of note, a small

morphine but showed a maximum increase in peak fn to 140 ⫾

could not be reversed with naloxone and thus do not seem to
have been opioid receptor mediated.

the main findings of these studies show that opioid receptor
activation on functionally well-defined bulbospinal respiratory
neurons in an in vivo canine preparation depresses neuronal
activity, but that neuronal depression with morphine occurs
only at local concentrations above the clinical range. in addition, clinical doses of intravenous  xxxd3094xxx , which depress
the activity of these neurons to a similar extent as maximally
effective local agonist concentrations, do not act via direct
opioid receptor activation. thus opioid-induced effects on
presynaptic neurons appear to be responsible for the depression
of these neurons at clinical concentrations.

picoejection of the opioid antagonist naloxone onto single
neurons during systemic intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  infusion
at clinically relevant dose rates
nine animals were used for this protocol to determine
whether opioid receptor activation on premotor neurons contributes to the respiratory neuronal depressant effects of systemic intravenous  xxxd3094xxx . figure 8 shows a typical
 xxxd3094xxx  protocol. peak phrenic nerve activity and single
neuron activity were depressed by systemic  xxxd3094xxx  infusion by ⬃50% (fig. 8, a and b). during steady-state infusion,
naloxone was picoejected onto the neuron to attempt local
reversal of the depressant  xxxd3094xxx  effects (fig. 8c). because neuronal activity did not increase with maximal local
naloxone rates, direct neuronal postsynaptic opioid receptor
activation did not appear to contribute to the depression of
neuronal activity. pooled data show that systemic infusions of
 xxxd3094xxx  depressed phrenic nerve activity by ⬃50% and
decreased the peak inspiratory and expiratory premotor neuron

we found that both ␮ and ␦ agonists depressed the activity
of respiratory premotor neurons but that the ␦1 receptor agonist
dpdpe was ineffective for expiratory neurons yet highly
effective for inspiratory neurons. local antagonism with the
nonselective antagonist naloxone fully reversed any depressant
opioid effects. these results match radioactive labeling studies
that show ␮ as well as ␦ opioid receptors distributed in the
respiratory centers of the brain stem (sales et al. 1985). haji
et al. (2003b) showed with immunoreactive labeling that ␮
receptors were widely distributed on functionally identified
bulbospinal respiratory neurons. our study provides additional
evidence that ␦ receptor activation can contribute to depression
of respiratory neurons, and it is the first to demonstrate a
depression of functionally identified respiratory premotor neurons by ␦ agonists. interestingly, there was a ceiling effect of
40 –50% depression for all agonists and even maximally effective agonist dose rates were not able to completely silence any
of these neurons. indeed, many neurons were only moderately
depressed, i.e., much ⬍50% at maximally effective local agonist dose rates.
only supraclinical doses of morphine have a direct
depressant effect on respiratory premotor neurons
the ␮ receptor agonist morphine has been shown to depress
respiratory neurons in vivo. using iontophoresed morphine (50
mm) onto single bulbar respiratory neurons in spinalized cats,
denavit-saubie et al. (1978) found that 35 of 58 neurons were
dose-dependently depressed, whereas 14 showed no effect and

effects, was not naloxone-reversible. more recently, haji et al.
(2003b) iontophoresed morphine (50 mm) onto feline bulbar
respiratory neurons and found membrane hyperpolarization
and a decrease in action potential discharge frequency in most
neurons. these effects were consistent with postsynaptic opioid receptor activation on these neurons. our studies show that
at a 10 ␮m barrel concentration of morphine, premotor neurons are only slightly depressed (⬇20%). this seems to be the
threshold concentration for postsynaptic receptor activation
that our preparation can discern. however, this concentration is
already ⬃250 times larger than the plasma concentration of
morphine that causes adequate analgesia in dogs (kukanich
et al. 2005; lucas et al. 2001). we expect that the iontophore-

sed (50 mm) morphine in the preceding studies most likely
resulted in concentrations at the neuronal level that were
similar to or even exceeded the highest concentration at maximal picoejection dose rates in our studies (1 mm).
the level of opioid tissue concentration is an important
consideration in determining the sites of action that produce
depression and slowing within the respiratory control neural
network. our finding that clinically relevant concentrations, which
are in the nanomolar range, have no direct effect on respiratory
premotor neurons is consistent with those of lalley (2006), who
used intracellular recordings from ventrolateral respiratory column neurons in barbiturate-anesthetized or decerebrate adult cats.
intravenous doses of the ␮ agonist fentanyl in the clinical dose
range (3–7 ␮g/kg) led to significant slowing of the respiratory
rhythm as well as an increase in duration of discharge in inspiratory and expiratory bulbospinal and propriobulbar neurons. however, there were no changes in the intrinsic properties of the
studied neurons; that is, there was no evidence from measurements of input resistance or action potential threshold, shape, and
afterhyperpolarization that the doses of fentanyl that slowed
rhythm acted on membrane conductances. lalley (2006) suggested that slowing was evidently generated through effects on
other neurons that control the onset and termination of inspiratory
and expiratory neuron discharges, such as those in the pons and
pre-bötzinger complex.

the  xxxd3094xxx  induced neuronal depression was not reversed. after termination of  xxxd3094xxx  neuronal discharge activity recovered to control levels (d), and

the 240 and 480 nm  xxxd3094xxx  concentrations were 10 and
20 ␮m, respectively. we have shown that glycine concentrations in the range of 0.5–1 mm produce a marked inhibition of
respiratory neuronal activity, including premotor neurons. neither of the two  xxxd3094xxx /glycine concentrations had an
appreciable effect on premotor neuronal activity. these data
suggested that  xxxd3094xxx  at clinically relevant concentrations
does not directly depress respiratory bulbospinal neurons,
which was confirmed by the systemic  xxxd3094xxx  protocol.

intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  depresses respiratory premotor
neuron activity but not through direct neuronal opioid
receptor activation
we explored the effects of clinical plasma concentrations
further by using an infusion of the ultra-short acting ␮ agonist
 xxxd3094xxx , which allowed steady-state depression of neuronal activity as well as end controls without residual opioid
activity. the results show that  xxxd3094xxx  at clinically relevant infusion rates, which caused significant depression of
phrenic nerve activity (⬃50%), also significantly depressed
respiratory premotor neuron activity (⬃40%). we conclude
that none of this depression is due to the direct action of the
opioid on inspiratory and expiratory bulbospinal neurons due
to the evidence from our two approaches. 1) during intravenous  xxxd3094xxx , the difference in neuronal peak discharge
frequency immediately before and during picoejection of naloxone was ⬍1% (mean ⫾ sd: 0.86 ⫾ 6.5%, paired t-analysis;
p ⫽ 0.579) for 18 neurons. 2) picoejection of  xxxd3094xxx  at
concentrations 20 – 40 times greater than the expected peak
plasma concentration during intravenous infusions at high
clinical dose rates did not alter the discharge frequency of these
neurons. in addition, the sensitivity of our technique was able
to detect a 13% increase in expiratory neuronal activity produced by local picoejection of naloxone indicating a small but
significant level of endogenous opioidergic activity. thus we
conclude that intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  had no direct effect on
the respiratory bulbospinal neurons and that their depression
was due to presynaptic effects.
we believe that the discrepancy between the direct, reversible
depressant effect of morphine on single neurons that we and other
investigators observed and the lack of local naloxone reversibility
of the intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  results from the difference of the
attained agonist concentrations at the neuronal level. the remifen-

tanil infusion rates we used (⬇0.5 ␮g䡠kg⫺1 䡠min⫺1) are expected
to result in plasma concentrations of ⱕ10 ng/ml or ⱕ24 nanomolar (michelsen et al. 1996) in dogs, which is ⬇40,000 times
less than the maximal concentrations of damgo or morphine
that were used in the local picoejection experiments to cause a
similar depression of neuronal activity. furthermore, picoejected  xxxd3094xxx  at concentrations ⬎20 times larger than
reported peak plasma concentrations during systemic  xxxd3094xxx  infusions had no effect on the discharge frequency of the
bulbospinal neurons. taken together our data strongly suggest
that clinical doses of therapeutic ␮ opioid agonists depress
respiratory premotor neurons by affecting mechanisms upstream from these neurons and not via direct opioid receptor
activation on these neurons.
with regard to the nature of the presynaptic depression by
intravenously administered opioids at clinical doses, our experimental approach is unable to pinpoint the exact mechanism. however, we speculate that the  xxxd3094xxx -induced
depression of the bulbospinal premotor neurons by ⬃40% is
likely due to effects on specific presynaptic neurons that are
extremely sensitive to the opioid at clinical concentrations. an
alternative explanation is that the opioid is producing a small
amount of postsynaptic depression throughout the network and
the summation of these small effects produces the 40% depression of the bulbospinal neurons. for this latter explanation to
be true, it would require these small effects to be propagated in
a cascade manner to summate to a greater level of depression.
for example, to produce a 40% depression from cascaded 5%
depressions would require 10 synaptically coupled neurons or
groups of neurons in series (0.9510 ⫽ 0.6). depressions by 10%
would require five cascaded effects. most network models of
the central respiratory system typically show many convergent
connections to a given vrg neuron but those connections are
not made by fourth- or higher-order neurons.
evidence in support of specific presynaptic neurons that may
be very sensitive to low clinical concentrations of opioids is the
finding of high concentrations of endomorphin-containing varicose fibers in brain stem regions that are intimately involved
with the control of breathing such as the nucleus tractus
solitarius (nts) and pontine parabrachial region (martinschild et al. 1999). these endomorphin-immunoreactive fibers
have been found to be in close proximity to high densities of ␮
opioid receptors (zadina et al. 1999). not only would the
number of ␮ opioid receptors on a neuron contribute to its
sensitivity but also the location of the receptors on the neuron.
if the receptors are strategically located on the axon terminals
similar to the primary afferent fibers in the dorsal horn of the
spinal cord, which appear to inhibit the release of neurotransmitters via inhibition of voltage-dependent ca2⫹ channels, the
effect of the opioid could be markedly enhanced compared
with a location of ␮ opioid receptors near or on the soma. thus
there are possible candidates for extremely opioid-sensitive
presynaptic neurons within the pathways that relay excitation
to the bulbospinal neurons.
the main source of excitation of canine bulbospinal premotor neurons consists of synaptic release of glutamate (dogas
et al. 1995; krolo et al. 1999, 2000). the level of excitation of
these neurons is also related to the level of chemodrive. thus
it is likely that opioid-induced depression of the chemosensory
system is involved. high densities of endomorphin (endogenous ␮ opioid agonist) immunoreactive fibers and cell bodies
j neurophysiol • vol

have been found in the dorsal medial portion of the caudal
nts, a region where second-order neurons of the carotid body
chemoreceptors are located (martin-schild et al. 1999). anatomical data at the light and electron microscopic level and
electrophysiological observations showed that ␮ opioid receptors are present at both pre- and postsynaptic sites in the
dorsolateral nts, often at the same synapse (poole et al. 2007).
thus it is possible that opioids affect the peripheral chemoreflex pathway by depressing synaptic input to the second-order
neurons. in addition, there appear to be multiple chemosensing
areas in the brain stem (feldman et al. 2003) with the retrotrapezoid nucleus playing a dominant role and having inputs to
the ventral respiratory column and the dorsal pons (guyenet
et al. 2008). the role of the lateral pons in the control of
breathing is well established (rybak et al. 2004; st-john and
paton 2004) and the fact that it receives chemodrive inputs and
is densely populated with endomorphin-immunoreactive fibers
(martin-schild et al. 1999) suggests that the pontine input to
bulbospinal neurons is also depressed.
another potential source of opioid-induced presynaptic depression are neurons within the pre-bötzinger complex
(prebc). in a neonatal rat preparation, gray et al. (1999)
suggested that the distribution of neurokinin-1 (nk1) receptor
neurons anatomically defined the prebc and that a subpopulation of neurons expressing both nk1 receptors and ␮ opioid
receptors generate respiratory rhythm and modulate respiratory
frequency. furthermore,  xxxg2242xxx -expressing cells within
the prebc are predominantly glutamatergic (guyenet et al.
2002). correlation analysis between rostral and caudal vrg
inspiratory neurons suggests that the more rostral prebc neurons drive the more caudal bulbospinal neurons (rekling and
feldman 1998; segers et al. 1987). thus any opioid-induced
depression of prebc neurons may reduce excitatory drive to
the bulbospinal neurons.
methodological considerations
this is the first study to use a continuous infusion of
 xxxd3094xxx  to test for opioid effects on respiratory neurons
in vivo. the establishment of a clinically relevant steady-state
opioid concentration, as judged from the steady-state ⬇50%
depression of phrenic nerve activity, is important to achieve
conclusive results. for example, haji injected intravenous
morphine (0.3–3.0 mg/kg) into decerebrate cats and showed a
biphasic effect on bulbar respiratory neurons with an initial
membrane hyperpolarization and decrease in input resistance
indicating postsynaptic effects and subsequent elevation of
input resistance indicating presynaptic effects only (haji et al.
2003a). possibly due to pharmacokinetic effects, the initial
changes resulted from a transient increase in morphine blood
concentration after the bolus, whereas the later changes were
observed during lower blood and effect-site concentrations.
such transient concentration effects make interpretation more
difficult.
possible physiological role of neuronal opioid receptors
we have discussed that the agonist plasma concentrations
reached during the  xxxd3094xxx  infusion are not sufficient to
directly affect respiratory premotor neuronal opioid receptors.
this leaves the question whether any physiological opioider-

clinical opioids and respiratory premotor neurons

gic/enkephalinergic input could be of sufficient magnitude to
have effects on these premotor neuronal receptors. based on
our data we expect this to require release of at least micromolar
concentrations of endogenous opioid agonists into the synaptic
cleft. it is well established that synaptic concentrations of
various endogenous neurotransmitters will transiently approach the concentrations of neurotransmitters stored in presynaptic vesicles. no data are available for synaptic concentrations of opioidergic neuropeptides, but release of the opioidergic neuropeptide  xxxg1801xxx  from synaptosomes has
been shown to be similar to classical neurotransmitters (verhage et al. 1992). for excitatory neurotransmitters, concentrations in presynaptic vesicles range from 1 to 5 mm for
glutamate (clements 1996; clements et al. 1992) to 270 mm
for serotonin in retzius cells (bruns et al. 2000). thus it is
possible that transient synaptic concentrations of endogenous
opioids from the fiber varicosities adjacent to ␮ opioid receptors (zadina et al. 1999) can reach the micromolar and possibly
millimolar range in vivo.
lack of endogenous opioid activity at the premotor
neuronal level
in our preparation, naloxone did not have any effect on
inspiratory neuron activity indicating that no endogenous opioid activation was present. however, a small but statistically
significant increase in neuronal frequency by ⬃10% was observed in expiratory neurons in both, substudies 2 and 3. haji
also described small excitatory effects of iontophoresed naloxone due to membrane depolarization in 5 of 18 bulbar respiratory neurons in decerebrate cats (haji et al. 2003a). however,
the systemic administration of large doses of naloxone (0.1
mg/kg) did not alter resting ventilation in healthy human
volunteers (bianchi et al. 1995; tabona et al. 1982). the
physiological role of opioidergic/enkephalinergic inputs on the
respiratory system has yet to be clarified.
in conclusion, our current studies on bulbospinal respiratory
premotor neurons in decerebrate dogs provide evidence that
these neurons express functional ␮ and ␦ opioid receptors.
however, clinically relevant concentrations of the ␮ agonist
 xxxd3094xxx  that depress phrenic nerve activity and respiratory
premotor neuron activity by ⬇ 50% appear to exert their
effects entirely upstream from these premotor neurons, i.e., at
presynaptic neurons.
