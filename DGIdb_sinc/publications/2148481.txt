abstract-inside-out
vesicularized membrane fragments from human erythrocytes were prepared to
study the effects of various ca’+ channel entry blockers of plasma membrane caz+ transport and
(ca’+ + mg’+)-atpase activity concomitantly. verapamil and diltiazem (0.01 to 5 mm) inhibited both
(ca2’ + mg*+)-atpase activity and initial rates of %a’+ net uptake analogously. in general, the
parameter affected most by these drugs, using either ca2+ transport or (ca2+ + mg2+)-5’-adenosinetriphospho-hydrolase
( xxxg225xxx   xxxg265xxx   xxxg441xxx   xxxg621xxx   xxxg725xxx   xxxg726xxx   xxxg1213xxx   xxxg2173xxx   xxxg2174xxx   xxxg2428xxx .3) ([ca*+ + mg2+]-atpase) measurements, was the stimulation by
calmodulin. however, the specificity and selectivity of inhibition appeared to be highly concentration
and membrane preparation dependent. verapamil and diltiazem inhibited the calmodulin-ca2+ transport
concentration-effect
relationship by changing its apparent affinity as well as the maximal velocity of
the process. in a “white ghost” membrane preparation,  xxxd318xxx  inhibited calmodulin activation with a
high degree of selectivity as opposed to its effects on calmoduhn activation in the vesicular preparation.
nifedipine failed to exhibit any specificity and modestly inhibited basal and calmodulin-activated insideout vesicular ca*+ transport -and (ca2’ + mg*+)-atpase alike. our results suggest that verapamil,
diltiazem and  xxxd318xxx  (0.01 to 0.3 mm), but not nifedipine (1 nm to 0.01 mm), in relatively high
concentrations can antagonize the calmodulin-stimulated ca’+-pump, i.e. the atpase as well as the
transport process. the inhibitors differed with regard to potency, selectivity, and the type of inhibition
they produced.

it is well recognized that, in erythrocytes,
the
(ca2+ + mgzc)-atpase
activity is the enzymatic
driving force of the calmodulin-regulated
plasma
membrane ca2+ extrusion pump. this was first
demonstrated by biochemical and biophysical studies
[l] and confirmed by a number of means including
pharmacological
ones where drugs were used to
examine both transport and atpase phenomena [2].
recent evidence from this laboratory indicates that
certain types of calcium channel entry blockers
inhibit calmodulin stimulation of (ca2+ + mg2+)atpase. unlike many other drugs, which by virtue
of their amphipathic or hydrophobic nature bind to
calmodulin and thus prevent it from binding and
acting on its target, the calcium entry blockers
produce apparent non-competitive
inhibition
of
(ca2+ + mg +)-atpase [3,4]. we postulated that
verapamil
and diltiazem
inhibited
calmodulin
activation of the (ca*+ + mg2+)-atpase by acting
at a low-affinity site on the enzyme rather than on
calmodulin directly, although the latter possibility
could not be excluded definitively.
the work described here was prompted to first
substantiate the inhibitory effects of verapamil and
diltiazem and then to further elucidate the site(s) of
action in a preparation with which one can assess
both the enzymatic atpase activity as well as
direct effects on the ca2+-translocating mechanism.
potentially, this approach can provide additional
information regarding the sites and mechanisms by
which these drugs can modulate ca*+ fluxes across

plasma membranes.
to this end we describe
experiments using inside-out vesicularized (iov)
erythrocyte membrane fragments measuring simultaneously both the biochemical and the biophysical
consequences of calcium entry blocker effects on the
ca*+ translocating mechanism. this should not only
contribute
to our understanding
of the entire
pharmacological spectrum of these drugs, but also
identify a novel, potentially useful tool to reversibly
inhibit the calmodulin-dependent
process by a
mechanism(s) other than by occupying the hydrophobic domain on calmodulin which interferes with
the regulation of the ca2+-pump indirectly.

analogous inhibition of (ca*+ + mg2+)-a tpase

data presented in this report are derived from the
same type of experiments as above with the exception
that these short-term experiments were run over a
3-min period in the presence of standard amounts
of 1 mm atp, 0.1 pg/ml of calmodulin (a roughly
half-maximally activating concentration) and 20 pm
45cac12. all initial transport rates, calculated from
a linear least squares fit, are based on counts
accumulated
and corrected for the percentage
of inside-out

the concurrent
inhibition
of iov
(ca2+ + mg2+)-atpase and net 45ca2+ uptake by
verapamil. both ca*+-transport and (ca2+ + mg2+)atpase activity measurements in the absence and
the presence of calmodulin and 20 ,um ca*’ were
affected by verapamil. however, it appeared as if
the calmodulin-stimulated
portion of the transport

and the atpase activity were antagonized preferentially in a concentration range of 0.2 to 2.0 mm
verapamil.
the high concentration
of 5 mm
verapamil basically abolished any type of ca2+
uptake activity. note the high degree of congruency
between the shapes and rates of ca2+-transport and
(ca2+ + mg2+)-atpase activity. from experiments
similar to those depicted in fig. 2, a summary of
inhibition of calmodulin-stimulated
(ca2+ + mg2+)atpase and ca2+-transport activities by verapamil
and diltiazem is presented in fig. 3. again, a good
agreement exists between the degree of inhibition
conferred by verapamil toward atpase and transport
activities (panels a and b). furthermore, the figure
also shows that diltiazem affected calmodulin
stimulation of transport and atpase activities in
a similar fashion, half-maximal
inhibition
of
calmodulin stimulation of both processes and by
both drugs was in the range of 0.8 to 1.3 mm (panels
c and d).

the ca2+-transport stimulation by calmodulin was
antagonized in an apparent non-competitive manner
showing decreases in maximal velocity of about
40% by 10e3m verapamil and 10m3m diltiazem
respectively. based on a molecular weight of 16,723
daltons, the apparent dissociation constant for
calmodulin was increased from 3.6 to 4.2nmol/

solubility limits, afforded no inhibition of either
basal or calmodulin-stimulated

however, this drug clearly inhibited iov ca2+pump and atpase activities but, in contrast to the
former compounds,
without any selectivity. in

(fig. 5 and table 1; b/c ratio >24) in the white

but only modestly
inhibited the iov preparation and with considerably
less specificity (fig. 6). thus,  xxxd318xxx  did not inhibit
basal atpase activity in regular membranes,
it
clearly affected vesicular basal (ca2+ + mg*+)atpase and transport activities. apparently, verapamil and diltiazem have a high degree of
congruency in both types of membrane preparations,

discussion

a
variety
of
structurally
heterogeneous
‘compounds,
commonly
referred
to as ca2+ antagonists, are thought to mediate negative ino-, chronoand dromotropic
cardiac effects, vasodilation,
and
protection
a ainst structural damage in response to
a cellular ca ‘i+ overload [91. while these compounds
appear
to oppose
entry
and consequences
of
intracellular
ca2+, they can, at the same time, also
interfere with a number of non-l type ca” channel
sites including
the very mechanism
that actively
extrudes ca2+ from the cell interior [lo]. to describe
fully a transport
system
and
understand
its
physiological implications,
including how drugs may
affect it, it is imperative
that both the biochemical
and the biophysical
aspects
of the transport
mechanism
be studied,
preferably
under closely
matched experimental
conditions.
it is under these
circumstances
that pharmacological
evidence can be
applied to bear on questions
of symmetry
of the
processes,
contributions
of passive fluxes to the
overall process,
stoichiometry
and also how the
drugs themselves affect the translocation
mechanism.
using a combined,
closely matched experimental
approach, we have attempted to delineate the effects
of ca*+ antagonists simultaneously
on both activities
of the plasma membrane
ca2+-pump.
typically,
(ca2+ + mg’+)-atpase
activities
are determined
over a 60- or 90-min period, whereas ca2+ transport
measurements
usually are a short-term measurement
to remain within the linear portion of the transport
curve, thus limiting the contributions
of back flux.
since our previous work on ca2+ antagonist effects
on (ca2+ + mg*+)-atpase
was done with white
ghost membranes
over prolonged
periods of time
[3,4], the experiments
shown in fig. 1 were carried
out to examine the effects of verapamil on iov ca*+
transport over a comparable
time span. as expected
from atpase
and shorter
0- to 3-min transport
experiments,
the rate of accumulation
to maximum
was reduced appreciably
by 3 x 10m4 m verapamil
and also seemed to blunt the roll-over phenomenon
seen in the presence
of calmodulin.
whether
the
roll-over was due to calmodulin
antagonism
or to a
direct effect on the membrane
(e.g. a membranestabilizing
effect) is not clear at this time. basal
activity was not reduced significantly
at this same
concentration
of verapamil but, interestingly enough,
achieved a higher level at 90 min, as did the control
curve. this may be, in part, because the basal uptake
curve lacks the gradual decline after reaching its
maximum which is characteristic
of the uptake curve
in the presence
of calmodulin.
alternatively,
the
roll-over and the somewhat
higher plateau may be
explained
by a ca?+ or ca’+-calmodulin
induced
increased
passive leak out of the vesicle which
apparently is also sensitive to inhibition by verapamil.
the possibility of a passive back leak is strengthened
by the observation
that similar red cell vesicles are

record

estimated
to accumulate,
over a 3-min period,
intracellular
ca2+ concentrations
as high as 2.5 mm

pi.

blocking passive ca2+ entry in intact erythrocytes
and ca2+ exit in iov membrane fragments by these
drugs is a likely possibility
since we know from
recent
hemorheological
studies that other ca2+
antagonists,
such as  xxxd318xxx ,
which
are also
calmodulin
antagonists,
can inhibit passive ca2+
leaks across the red cell plasma membrane
[ll, 121.
thus, verapamil appears to affect predominantly
the
rate at which ca2+ is accumulated,
rather than the
extent to which these vesicles are capable of trapping
the cation.
a high degree of congruency
of ca2+ transport
and (ca2+ + mg*+)-atpase
activities is shown in
figs. 2 and 3. verapamil and diltiazem affected both
parameters
in an analogous manner with an tcso for
the inhibitors of roughly lo-” m. up to this antagonist
concentration
selectivity
for inhibition
of the
calmodulin-stimulated
portion was reasonably
well
preserved but rapidly deteriorated
with even higher
concentrations.
from this it appears
as if these
compounds
do not uncouple
but inhibit enzymic
activity by at least two different modes of action,
one of which involves antagonism
of calmodulin
activation.
as in the case of phenothiazine
effects
on (ca2+ + mg2+)-atpase
activities
[13, 141, the
present results with verapamil
and diltiazem also
suggest calmodulin-specific
as well as direct enzyme
inhibitory actions. this is contrasted
by two other
ca2+ antagonists,
nifedipine on the one hand, which
showed no selectivity in either of the preparations
tested, and  xxxd318xxx  which at 100ym quite readily
antagonized
the effects of calmodulin
specifically,
particularly so in the white ghost preparation
(table
1). it is not clear why in the vesicle preparation
basal
activities
of (ca2+ + mg2+)-atpase
and ca2+transport
appeared
to be affected
much more
severely by  xxxd318xxx , thus diminishing the specificity
ratio considerably.
the difference
in ca*+ entry
blocker effects, particularly nifedipine and  xxxd318xxx 
effects on the ghost preparation
and on iov atpase
activities, compared
to the similarity of effects of
verapamil and diltiazem, may well be an indication
of the susceptibility
of the vesicular preparation
to
drugs with a high degree
of hydrophobicity.
notwithstanding,
it also points out the remarkable
1ac.k of adverse effects of the diphenylalkylamine
and benzothiazepine
derivative which may explain
in part their relative lack of in uiuo toxicity.
the complex nature of inhibition
of the ca’+pump by verapamil
and by diltiazem
is further
illustrated
by examining
the concentration-effect
relationship
of the calmodulin
activation
of ca2+
transport
(fig. 4). these transport
data, showing
mixed kinetics, are in good agreement
with data
reported for calmodulin stimulation from our earlier
work examining
the effects of these drugs on
(ca2+ + mg2’)-atpase
activity [3,4]. as has been
pointed out in recent reviews on drug interactions
with the ca2* translocation
mechanisms
[15,16],
data presented
here corroborate
that there are
several
possible
modes
of action that lead to
pharmacological
modification
of the plasma mem-

ca2+-pump inhibition and ca2+ antagonists
brane

cal+-pump.

it appears

that

certain

drugs,

such as  xxxd318xxx , can affect the same pump mechanism
in more than one way, depending on the dose and
the experimental preparation used. while membrane
stroma and vesicle preparation are important tools
in identifying drug interactions with the ca2+-pump
mechanism initially, they have limited usefulness in
delineating the exact nature of the interaction of
drugs with the ca*+-pump. rather, these studies
will need to be extended
by identifying
and
characterizing the binding sites for these drugs on
the purified pump protein outside its membrane
environment. this should eventually, together with
subsequent reconstitution of the protein, provide a
rational basis from which other specific and hopefully
more selective

inhibitors

can be developed.
