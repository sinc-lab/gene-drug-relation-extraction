induction of apoptotic cell death. arsenite, the trivalent form of
inorganic arsenic, is a potent inducer of mitogen-activated
protein (map) kinase signal transduction pathways. recent
evidence suggests that the differential activation of various
components of the map kinase pathways is at least partly
responsible for the pleiotropic effects of arsenite in cells (reviewed in bernstam and nriagu, 2000).
three major map kinase pathways, designated by their
terminal kinases, have been extensively studied: the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( xxxg1369xxx /2), c- xxxg1370xxx  ( xxxg1370xxx /2), and p38 kinase pathways. these map kinases
are activated via a series of sequential phosphorylations of
upstream kinases, and they function primarily to transduce
signals to the cell nucleus, ultimately affecting gene expression. among the targets of the map kinase pathways induced
by arsenite (liu et al., 2001) are components of the activator
protein 1 (ap-1) transcription factor, a heterodimer or homodimer consisting of fos/jun or jun/jun proteins that regulate
the expression of multiple genes, including those encoding the
fos and jun proteins. generally, activation of the erk pathway is associated with proliferation, whereas activation of the
jnk and p38 pathways is associated with the induction of
apoptosis by various physical and chemical stresses. however,
it is now apparent that the role of each map kinase pathway is
determined by multiple factors, including cell type, the particular isoform of the activated kinases, the duration of kinase
activation, and other regulatory signals.
several published studies demonstrate that the complex
dose-dependent and cell type-specific outcomes of arsenic exposure involve the differential activation of map kinase pathways. for example, activation of the erk pathway by low
concentrations of sodium arsenite-induced transformation of
mouse epidermal cells in vitro, whereas exposure to higher
arsenite concentrations (⬎50 ␮m) resulted in jnk pathway
activation and apoptosis induction (huang et al., 1999a,b).
chronic, low-level (⬍6 ␮m) arsenite exposure of c3h 10t1/2
fibroblasts, a model system of in vitro carcinogenesis, disrupted the normal regulation of proliferative signals mediated
via the receptor  xxxg2198xxx  pathway. this pathway is an
upstream activator of erk and is believed to be responsible for

various forms of inorganic arsenic are significant environmental contaminants that have multiple effects on cells, including the
induction of apoptotic cell death. induction of apoptosis in lymphoid cells can mediate immunotoxicity following exposure to
chemicals. however, the mechanisms regulating the sensitivity of
b-lymphocytes to arsenic-induced apoptosis are not understood.
therefore, we investigated the involvement of key mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and apoptosis induction by sodium
arsenite in a model system of chemically resistant and susceptible
b-lymphoma cell lines. these studies revealed a differential requirement for the c- xxxg1370xxx  (jnk) pathway for
apoptosis induction by sodium arsenite in the resistant ew36
versus sensitive st486 cell lines. specifically, activation of the
jnk pathway was not required for arsenite-induced apoptosis in
st486 cells, whereas jnk pathway activation was always associated with apoptosis induction in ew36 cells. importantly, we
found that ew36 cells, which overexpress the bcl-2 protein, can be
substantially sensitized to arsenite-induced apoptosis by prior exposure to nonlethal hyperthermia. moreover, pretreatment with
an  xxxd805xxx  acted synergistically with hyperthermia
to further sensitize ew36 cells. the inhibition of p38 prolonged a
transient period of jnk phosphorylation that occurred immediately after heat shock treatment and involved the persistent activation of sek1, one of the kinases upstream of jnk. significantly,
the sensitization of resistant cells is characterized by a lowering of
the threshold concentration of arsenite required to activate the
jnk pathway and induce apoptosis.

arsenic is a persistent environmental contaminant eliciting
multiple pathophysiological effects. it induces skin hyperkeratosis and is cardiotoxic, immunotoxic, and potentially carcinogenic (abernathy et al., 1999; burns et al., 1991; descotes,
1988; engel et al., 1994; sommer and mcmanus, 1953;
waalkes et al., 2000). at the cellular level, arsenic can induce
effects ranging from protein damage to the formation of reactive oxygen species resulting in impaired cell function and the

arsenite-induced apoptosis in b-lymphoma cells

the mitogenic effect of arsenite in this system (trouba et al.,
2000). similarly, acute exposure of vascular endothelial cells
to low levels of arsenite (1–5 ␮m) elicited a mitogenic response, which correlated with the generation of oxidative stress
and the activation of tyrosine-kinase signaling cascades, but
not with stress-kinase activation. in contrast, this same study
revealed that the activation of p38 kinase required high concentrations of arsenite (100 ␮m) and was associated with cell
death (barchowsky et al., 1999). together, these and other
published studies (ludwig et al., 1998) clearly attribute the
ability of arsenite to induce apoptotic cell death to activation of
the jnk and/or p38 pathways. invariably, however, high concentrations of arsenite, often in excess of 100 ␮m, were required to elicit an apoptotic response in those experimental
systems.
understanding the cellular and molecular basis of arseniteinduced alterations in cells requires the systematic analysis of
key regulatory pathways that may be involved, as well as the
innate characteristics of the cell type that may confer stress
resistance or sensitivity. in addition, as suggested by the above
studies, mechanisms of arsenite-induced cytotoxic effects need
to be understood in the context of cell type and arsenic concentration, especially at environmentally relevant levels. blymphoid cells are particularly attractive for such studies, as
this cell type and various established cell lines are highly
sensitive to several drugs and environmental toxicants (smith
and sladek, 1985; wilmer et al., 1992). burkitt’s lymphoma
(bl) cell lines have proven to be a particularly useful model
system of human germinal center-derived b-lymphocytes.
they have been important in studies on the induction of
apoptosis by engagement of the surface igm receptor and the
subsequent rescue from igm-induced apoptosis by cd40, critical components of negative/positive selection of b-lymphocytes during development (hornung et al., 1998; kaptein et al.,
1996; sakata et al., 1995, 1999). importantly, although these
studies invoke the differential activation of various map kinase pathways in receptor-mediated processes, little is known
concerning the signaling pathways that regulate the induction
of apoptosis by chemical agents in these cells.
similar to b-lymphocyte subpopulations in vivo, individual
bl cell lines show differences in their sensitivity to apoptosis
induction after exposure to radiation and a variety of drugs and
toxic chemicals (fan et al., 1994; gaidano et al., 1991; lin et
al., 1998; o’brien et al., 2001). this differential sensitivity
cannot be attributed solely to the cellular factors commonly
associated with regulation of apoptosis, such as p53 status,
drug efflux, or glutathione level (fan et al., 1994; gaidano et
al., 1991; lee and shacter, 1997; merino et al., 1994; uckun
et al., 1991). thus, other cellular systems are likely responsible
for regulating sensitivity to chemically induced apoptosis in
bl cells.
we recently validated a panel of bl cell lines that demonstrate significant differences in their susceptibility to apoptosis
induction as a model system to examine the association of

83

map kinases with chemically induced apoptosis (o’brien et
al., 2001). the st486 line shows sensitivity to anticancer
drugs and mitochondrial toxicants and has a high ratio of
bax/bcl-2, proapoptotic, and antiapoptotic members, respectively, of the bcl-2 family of proteins. in contrast, the ew36
cell line shows multidrug resistance and has a low bax/bcl-2
ratio because of the overexpression of the antiapoptotic bcl-2
protein. both cell lines have similar drug efflux characteristics
and cell cycle transit profiles.
the present study was undertaken to compare the sensitivity
of these cell lines with sodium arsenite over a wide range of
concentrations and to investigate the role of map kinase
signaling pathways in regulating chemically induced apoptosis.
we specifically addressed the requirement for activation of the
jnk pathway in apoptosis induction in the st486 compared
with ew36 cell lines. in addition, we studied the interaction of
other stresses, specifically nonlethal heat shock, with low-dose
arsenite exposure in ew36 cells to determine whether synergistic interactions of sublethal treatments can sensitize resistant
cells to apoptosis induction (and whether such interactions are
mediated by map kinase activation).
importantly, we found a significant difference in the requirement for jnk pathway activation in arsenite-induced apoptosis
between the two cell lines. whereas the ew36 cells underwent
apoptosis at relatively high arsenite concentrations in a manner
associated with jnk pathway activation, st486 cells underwent apoptosis at low-to-moderate concentrations in a jnkindependent manner. moreover, sublethal hyperthermia, which
itself induced only a transient activation of jnk in ew36,
acted synergistically by lowering the threshold concentration
of arsenite required to activate the jnk pathway and to induce
apoptosis. we also found that thermal sensitization of ew36
cells can be further enhanced by inhibition of the p38 kinase
pathway. in all cases, sensitization of the resistant line involved
the sustained activation of the jnk pathway and was mediated,
at least in part, by activation of its upstream kinase, sek1.

cell lines and culture conditions and determination of growth inhibition.
the bl cell line st486 was obtained from atcc, rockville, md. the ew36
cell line was obtained from dr. ian t. magrath, national cancer institute,
bethesda, maryland. both of the cell lines grow optimally and similarly in the
same medium formulation, have doubling times of approximately 24 h, and are
epstein-barr virus-negative. the cell lines were cultured in medium rpmi
1640 (gibco) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, penicillin-streptomycin, and l-glutamine. cells were grown at 37°c, 5% co 2, and 95% humidity.
for all experiments, cultures were set up at a density of 0.4 ⫻ 10 6 cells/ml
and allowed to grow for 24 h. after appropriate pretreatment (i.e., ⫹/– heat

84

muscarella and bloom

shock at 43°c for 1 h or ⫹/– skf), cells were plated into six well plates at 3
ml/well, and sodium arsenite was added. at the designated times, cells were
harvested for protein immunoblotting or for detection of morphological
apoptosis as described below. in addition, cell counts were performed at 12,
24, 36, and 48 h after chemical addition, using a coulter model zm counter
and channelyzer. increases in cell number over time were determined for a
series of graded doses of arsenite ranging from 1 to 50 ␮m. id 50s were derived
based on a comparison of the extent of growth inhibition for each concentration of arsenite compared with untreated control.
cytological detection of apoptosis and necrosis with the h/pi assay. the
induction of apoptosis was analyzed using a double fluorescence staining
technique (muscarella and bloom, 1997; muscarella et al., 1998). the procedure allows simultaneous detection of plasma membrane integrity by dye
exclusion and apoptotic phenotypes by observing condensed, segregated chromatin in live cells. briefly, cells were stained in 20 ␮g/ml  xxxd3027xxx  iodide
(emitting red fluorescence) and 100 ␮g/ml hoechst 33342 (emitting blue
fluorescence) for 15 min at 37°c in the dark. the double fluorescence was
detected with a leitz aristoplan microscope equipped with an epifluorescence
system and a long-pass filter cube a. dead cells emit red and live cells emit
blue fluorescence. apoptotic cells have a characteristic phenotype of condensed, segregated chromatin in intact but shrunken cells (fluorescing blue in
early stages and red later on). the apoptotic phenotype was easy to detect and
discriminate from necrotic cells, which were swollen, had irregular/damaged
membranes, and were pi-positive. the chromatin was minimally condensed,
with some accumulation near the nuclear membrane. typically, 200 cells were
scored for each sample and were classified as either necrotic, apoptotic, or
normal/viable.
statistical analysis of the data. statistical analysis of apoptosis induction
was as follows: 200 cells were scored per sample and data were entered into
a database for subsequent analysis. percentages (e.g., percent apoptosis) were
transformed by arc sin to normalize the data. a one-way analysis of variance
(anova) was performed on data sets from experiments including control and
treatment values. if the f-statistic was significant, post hoc comparisons were
made using fisher’s lsd test.
protein immunoblotting. after chemical exposure for the specified period
of time, cells (1 ml of culture) were collected, washed in phosphate buffered
saline (pbs), and solubilized in 50 ␮l of 1 ⫻ laemmli sample buffer (65.2 mm
tris-cl, ph 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% sds, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 5%
␤- xxxd26xxx ). ten microliters of lysate (approximately 4 ⫻ 10 5 cells/
sample) were subjected to sds-page in a 4 –15% gradient gel. gels were
electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (bio-rad) in 25
mm tris, ph 8.3, 192 mm glycine, and 20% meoh. for detection of
phosphorylated kinases, membranes were first probed with antibodies specific
for the phosphorylated forms of  xxxg1369xxx /2,  xxxg1370xxx /2, and p38 (new england
biolabs). filters were subsequently reprobed using antibodies that recognize
the proteins independent of phosphorylation status to ensure that differences in
signal were due to phosphorylation of the protein and not to differences in
amounts of total protein. for parp cleavage, an antibody that recognizes the
113-kd, intact parp, and the 85-kd cleavage product was used to simultaneously detect cleaved and uncleaved parp (stressgen, inc.). membranes
were washed in tbs (20 mm tris, 500 mm nacl, ph 7.5), then blocked for
1 h in tbs containing 5% dried milk. filters were washed in tbs containing
0.1% tween-20 and incubated overnight at 4°c with primary antibody diluted
appropriately in tbs containing 5% bovine  xxxg124xxx . filters were
washed again and incubated with the second antibody, horseradish peroxidase
conjugate. detection was then performed using an enhanced chemiluminescent
(ecl) system. quantitation of the signals was performed using an alpha
imager 2000 documentation and analysis system, equipped with alphaease
version 3.2 software (alpha innotech corp.).
map kinase activity assay. kinase activity assays were performed using
a commercially available kit (cell signaling, inc.). briefly, 2 h after chemical
exposure, cells were lysed on ice in a buffer containing 20 mm tris (ph 7.5),
150 mm nacl, 1 mm edta, 1 mm egta, 1% triton x-100, 2.5 mm sodium
pyrophosphate, 1 mm ␤-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm na 3vo 4, 1 ␮g/ml leupep-

tin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pmsf). lysates were sonicated
and p38 was immunoprecipitated by gentle agitation overnight at 4°c using a
monoclonal antibody for phosphorylated p38 immobilized to sepharose beads.
antibody complex was collected by centrifugation and, after washing, was
incubated for 30 min at 30°c in kinase buffer containing 25 mm tris (ph 7.5),
5 mm ␤-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm dtt, 0.1 mm na 3vo 4, and 10 mm mgcl 2,
plus 2 mg/ml of a gst-atf2 fusion protein as the substrate. phosphorylation
of the substrate was detected by subjecting the kinase reaction to electrophoresis and immunoblotting as described above, using an antibody specific for the
phosphorylated form of atf2.

results

bl cell lines are differentially sensitive
to arsenite-induced apoptosis
we evaluated the sensitivity of the bl cell lines st486 and
ew36 to apoptosis induction after exposure to sodium arsenite.
apoptosis was measured in two ways: first, by detecting the
presence of characteristic condensed, segregated chromatin by
fluorescence microscopy after staining with h/pi, and second,
by detection of cleaved parp by protein immunoblotting (fig.
1). we have previously demonstrated that the h/pi fluorescence assay is a sensitive and quantitative indicator of apoptosis and correlates well with the detection of apoptosis by
nucleosomal ladder formation and by parp cleavage (muscarella and bloom, 1997; muscarella et al., 1998). we have also
shown that the h/pi technique detects necrotic cells, characterized by  xxxd3027xxx  iodide uptake and red fluorescence
throughout the cell. however, the low-to-moderate concentrations (⬍80 ␮m) of arsenite used in the experiments described
in the present study resulted primarily in apoptotic cell death,
as reported below.
exposure to increasing concentrations of arsenite resulted in
marked differences in the induction of morphological apoptosis
between the cell lines, as measured by the h/pi assay (fig. 1a)
and in the induction of cleaved parp (fig. 1b). the st486
cell line showed a high degree of sensitivity to apoptosis
induction by sodium arsenite, with about 80 –90% apoptosis,
and extensive cleavage of parp, detected at concentrations
from 5 to 80 ␮m. the ew36 cell line, however, showed only
modest levels of apoptosis and parp cleavage.
in contrast to apoptosis induction, we found that growth
inhibition by arsenite was similar for the two lines, with id 50
values of 5 ␮m and 7 ␮m for st486 and ew36 cells, respectively. complete growth arrest occurred at a concentration of
20 ␮m for both cell lines. although these data do not prove
similar uptake of arsenite in these cell lines, they suggest this
is the case, and indicate that growth arrest and apoptosis
induction by arsenite are separable processes. moreover, these
findings are consistent with our previous findings of similar
p-glycoprotein pump activities in these lines (o’brien et al.,
2001) and provide the basis for identifying differences between
sensitive and resistant bl cell lines in arsenite-induced signaling for apoptosis.

arsenite-induced apoptosis in b-lymphoma cells

85

data show that the st486 cells underwent extensive apoptosis/
parp cleavage at arsenite concentrations below those required
for activation of the jnk/c-jun pathway. in contrast, ew36
cells showed parp cleavage only at concentrations of arsenite
that activated this pathway, with neither apoptosis induction
nor jnk pathway activation detected at lower arsenite concentrations.
although this experiment revealed that the two bl cell lines
appear to differ in their activation of jnk/c-jun at low arsenite
concentrations, c-jun induction was detected in the st486 and
the ew36 cell lines at 80 ␮m. however, the level of c-jun
appeared lower in the st486 cells compared with ew36 cells
(fig. 2a). to further understand this observed difference in
jnk/c-jun activation, we examined the kinetics of kinase
activation and apoptosis induction in cultures exposed to 80
␮m arsenite over a period of several hours after addition of
chemical (fig. 2b).

and subjected to protein immunoblotting using the parp antibody that detects

representative of the experiments quantitated in (a).

bl cell lines show differences in the association of jnk
pathway activation with arsenite-induced apoptosis
activation of the jnk pathway is associated with arseniteinduced apoptosis in a number of cell types. we determined the
extent of activation of this kinase pathway in the bl cell lines
and its association with arsenite-induced apoptosis. activation
of this pathway was assessed in two ways. first, phosphorylated jnk was identified in cell lysates 2 h after arsenite
exposure by protein immunoblotting using antibodies specific
for the dual-phosphorylated, and by inference active, forms of
the two  xxxg1372xxx /jnk isoforms,  xxxg1370xxx  and  xxxg1372xxx  (fig. 2a; pjnk1 and p- xxxg1372xxx ). filters were then reprobed with an antibody that detects each kinase regardless of its phosphorylation
state (fig. 2a;  xxxg1370xxx  and  xxxg1372xxx ) to ensure equal loading of
each lane and to serve as an internal control for subsequent
quantitation. second, the induction of one of the downstream
targets of the jnk pathway, c-jun, was determined 24 h after
arsenite exposure, at the same time as parp cleavage. the

fig. 2. association of jnk/c-jun pathway activation/induction and
apoptosis-specific parp cleavage following exposure to sodium arsenite in the
bl cell lines. (a) cultures of st486 and ew36 were exposed to sodium
arsenite at the indicated concentrations. at 2 h after addition, aliquots were
taken and lysates were subjected to immunoblotting for phospho- followed by
total- xxxg1370xxx  and  xxxg1372xxx  (p- xxxg1370xxx /p- xxxg1372xxx  and  xxxg1370xxx / xxxg1372xxx ). at 24 h, aliquots
were taken and subjected to immunoblotting for c-jun and for parp, as
indicated. (b) sodium arsenite was added to cultures of st486 and ew36 at
a concentration of 80 ␮m. aliquots were taken at the indicated times and
lysates were immunoblotted for phospho- and total  xxxg1370xxx  and  xxxg1372xxx , for
induction of c-jun, and for parp cleavage (arrow).

86

muscarella and bloom

for both cell lines, phospho- xxxg1370xxx  and 2 were detected 1 h
after arsenite addition and sustained for several hours following exposure (fig. 2b; p- xxxg1370xxx  and p- xxxg1372xxx ). there was some
reduction in the signal for phopsho- xxxg1372xxx  in st486 at 8 h and
for phospho- xxxg1370xxx  and  xxxg1372xxx  in ew36 cells at 18 h. as this
loss of phospho-jnk signal coincided with the induction of
apoptosis, we are unable to attribute it to specific differences in
the regulation of phospho-jnk between the cell lines. overall,
however, the two cell lines showed relatively similar profiles of
jnk phosphorylation during the first several hours of arsenite
exposure.
in contrast, the cell lines differed significantly with respect
to the kinetics of c-jun induction and parp cleavage. ew36
cells showed a clear time-related increase in c-jun protein that
preceded the appearance of cleaved parp. moreover, no morphological apoptosis was detected in ew36 cells during the
first 8 h of exposure. in contrast, st486 cells showed extensive
parp cleavage at 4 h, which occurred in the absence of
detectable c-jun. levels of morphological apoptosis detected
by the fluorescence assay paralleled the rapid induction of
parp cleavage: 50% of st486 cells showed morphological
apoptosis at 6 h. however, c-jun protein was minimally induced during this period. thus, we surmise that early and
extensive apoptosis in the st486 cultures occurs before they
can accumulate measurable levels of c-jun protein. these data
suggest that, whereas early signaling for phospho-jnk by
arsenite is similar between the cell lines, apoptosis induction in
st486 cells is rapid and involves signals independent of the
induction of downstream products of the jnk/c-jun pathway.
in contrast, ew36 cells show clear temporal and concentration-dependent associations of jnk phosphorylation, c-jun
induction, and apoptosis.
nonlethal hyperthermia sensitizes ew36 cells
to arsenite-induced apoptosis
ew36 cells overexpress bcl-2 (lee and schacter, 1997;
o’brien et al., 2001), with approximately 50-fold higher levels
of this protein compared with st486 and other bl cell lines.
our observed association of the jnk/c-jun activation/induction with arsenite-induced apoptosis suggests that manipulation of this pathway may be effective for bypassing bcl-2–
mediated resistance to apoptosis induction in ew36 cells.
hyperthermia activates the jnk pathway and induces apoptosis in lymphoma and leukemic cell lines (buzzard et al., 1998;
katschinski et al., 1999). therefore, we were interested in
whether the bl cell lines are differentially sensitive or resistant
to treatment with hyperthermia and whether exposure to heat
shock may be used as an alternative way of activating the jnk
pathway in resistant cells.
we found that st486 cells underwent rapid and extensive
apoptosis after exposure to heat shock of 43°c for 60 min,
approaching 100% morphological apoptosis (data not shown)
and parp cleavage at 24 h (fig. 3a). in contrast, the same

fig. 3. hyperthermia-mediated sensitization of ew36 cells to apoptosis
induction. (a) cultures of st486 and ew36 cells were subjected to heat shock
(43°c for 60 min) and allowed to recover at 37°c for 6 or 24 h as indicated.
lysates were then subjected to immunoblotting for assessment of parp
cleavage. (b) cultures of ew36 cells were subjected to heat shock as above,
allowed to recover for 4 h at 37°c, then exposed to 80 ␮m arsenite as indicated
(⫹) for 2 h. arsenite was washed out and aliquots of cultures were immediately sampled for p38 activity, as determined by the ability of immunoprecipitated phospho-p38 to phosphorylate its substrate atf2, or subjected to
immunoblotting for p-jnk. the remainder of the cultures were incubated for
an additional 20 h. lysates were collected for detection of cleaved parp
(arrow) by immunoblotting. the blots shown are representative of the experiments quantitated in (c). (c) morphological detection of apoptosis in heatsensitized ew36 cells was determined by the h/pi fluorescence assay. the
results are presented as the mean ⫾ sem of three independent experiments.

heat-shock treatment was not lethal to ew36 cells. however,
the ew36 cell line showed substantial sensitization toward a
previously sublethal exposure to arsenite when first subjected

arsenite-induced apoptosis in b-lymphoma cells

to this nonlethal heat-shock treatment (figs. 3b and 3c). the
number of cells exhibiting morphological apoptosis increased
from an average of approximately 25% in arsenite-treated
cultures to 70% in cultures exposed to heat shock plus arsenite
(fig. 3c). the extent of parp cleavage increased in a similar
manner (fig. 3b; parp).
an analysis of map kinase activation in these cultures (fig.
3b) revealed that although phospho- xxxg1370xxx  and 2 were not
detected in the culture treated with hyperthermia alone, phospho-jnk was induced by arsenite exposure, with the highest
levels detected with the combined treatment. analysis of a
second map kinase pathway, the p38 pathway, also commonly
associated with stress responses, revealed a somewhat different
profile of activation. a 1.5-fold increase in p38 activity was
detected in the heat-treated culture over that of the control.
however, as was found for jnk, the highest level was detected
in cultures subjected to the combined treatment, which approached a 10-fold increase in p38 activity.
because we observed enhanced activation of both the p38
and jnk pathways in ew36 cells sensitized by hyperthermia,
we performed experiments to further understand the potential
contribution of these two pathways in the acquired sensitivity
of this cell line. for these experiments we used several pharmacological inhibitors of p38 kinase: sb202190 (sb2), its
analogues, skf86002 (skf) and sc68376, or an inactive
analogue, sb202474 (sb-inact). we found that treatment of
cell cultures with each of the active p38 inhibitors gave similar
results. however, sb2 on its own induced erk phosphorylation in the bl cell lines, whereas skf did not. the ability of
some p38 inhibitors to activate the erk pathway via ras/raf
signaling has been reported (hall-jackson et al., 1999). however, to avoid the potential confounding effects of erk activation, we used skf in the experiments reported here.
the hsp27 stress protein is induced by arsenite and phosphorylated by mapkap kinase2, which is a substrate of p38
kinase. using an antibody specific for phospho-hsp27 (phsp27) or total hsp27, we determined the concentration of
skf required to substantially inhibit p38-mediated hsp27
phosphorylation in ew36 cells following arsenite exposure
(fig. 4a). skf gave a concentration-dependent decrease in
phosphorylation of hsp27 without affecting the overall level of
induction of the protein. for the experiments described, skf at
a concentration of 20 ␮m was used, as substantial inhibition of
hsp27 phosphorylation (70%) was achieved at this level, and it
is below the concentrations for which nonspecific effects of the
p38 inhibitors have been reported.
in agreement with the previous experiment, we found that
prior heat shock sensitized the ew36 cells to arsenite-induced
apoptosis, effectively decreasing the concentration of arsenite
required to induce at least 50% parp cleavage from 40 ␮m to
20 ␮m (fig. 4b; compare arsenite alone [as] to heat shock
plus arsenite [hs ⫹ as]). a similar reduction in the threshold of
arsenite required for c-jun induction was also achieved. unexpectedly, prior treatment of cells with skf (skf ⫹ as) had

at 20 h, aliquots were taken and lysates were subjected to immunoblotting first
with a phospho-hsp27 specific antibody (p-hsp27), followed by an antibody
that recognizes total hsp27. the signal for phospho-hsp27 was determined by
densitometry and normalized to total signal. the percent decrease is indicated
below each lane. (b) cultures of ew36 were exposed to arsenite alone (as) at
the indicated concentrations, pretreated with heat shock and a 4-h recovery
prior to arsenite addition (hs ⫹ as), pretreated with skf for 4 h prior to
arsenite addition (skf ⫹ as), pretreated with heat shock with skf present
during the 4-h recovery (hs ⫹ skf ⫹ as), or pretreated with an inactive
analogue of the p38 inhibitors (sb(inact) ⫹ as). at 24 h, aliquots were taken
and lysates were subjected to immunoblotting for parp cleavage and c-jun
induction. (c) cultures of ew36 were pretreated with the ap-1 inhibitor
oleandrin at a concentration of 0.1 ␮g/ml for 2 h, then exposed to arsenite for
24 h at the concentrations indicated. parp cleavage and c-jun induction were
detected as above.

an effect similar to that of prior hyperthermia, lowering the
threshold for parp cleavage and c-jun induction. moreover,
addition of skf just prior to or immediately after heat shock
resulted in an even greater reduction in the concentration of
arsenite required to induce parp cleavage and c-jun induction
(fig. 4b; hs ⫹ skf ⫹ as). in all cases, the induction of
morphological apoptosis paralleled that for parp cleavage
(data not shown).

these data suggest that heat shock and p38 inhibition both
contribute to the sensitization of ew36 cells. furthermore,
these experiments suggest that sensitization by the p38 inhibitiors is not the result of nonspecific activity of the compounds.
first, sensitization of ew36 cells occurred at the same skf
concentration required to substantially inhibit p38 activity, as
measured by the reduction in phosphorylated hsp27. second,
pretreatment of cells with the structural analogue that is unable
to inhibit p38 (young et al., 1997), confirmed in our study by
its inability to block phosphorylation of hsp27 (data not
shown), failed to sensitize ew36 cells to arsenite-induced
apoptosis. the profiles of parp cleavage and c-jun induction
were similar for cultures pretreated with the inactive analogue
as for cultures exposed to arsenite alone (fig. 4b; compare as
with sb-inact ⫹ as). it is interesting to note that skf treatment did not similarly sensitize the st486 cells to apoptosis
induction by arsenite (data not shown). however, this is consistent with our previous experiments that indicate arseniteinduced apoptosis occurs rapidly, in a manner independent of
activation/induction of the jnk/c-jun pathway, in the sensitive
cell line.
the above experiments suggest that the jnk and p38 pathways have opposing effects on arsenite-induced apoptosis in
the ew36 cell line, with inhibition of p38 sensitizing cells to
apoptosis induction in a manner associated with activation of
the jnk/c-jun pathway. to further explore the requirement of
the jnk/c-jun pathway in apoptosis induction, cultures of
ew36 cells were pretreated with oleandrin. this bioflavanoid
inhibits the  xxxg1222xxx  (manna et al., 2000), a
downstream target of the jnk pathway that activates expression of the c-jun gene. consistent with published data, we
found that treatment of ew36 cells with oleandrin inhibited the
induction of c-jun by arsenite (fig. 4c). importantly, oleandrin
also abolished parp cleavage in these cultures. however, it
did not block the induction of phospho-jnk by arsenite (data
not shown). together, these data suggest that targets downstream of jnk and associated with ap-1 activation are required for apoptosis induction/parp cleavage in the ew36
cells.
nonlethal hyperthermia induces transient phosphorylation
of jnk in ew36 cells that is prolonged
by inhibition of p38
to understand the potential interaction of p38 inhibition and
hyperthermia with induction of jnk/c-jun, we analyzed the
kinetics of kinase activation during a time course consisting of
varying lengths of exposure to heat shock with and without a
period of recovery (fig. 5a). cultures of st486 or ew36 cells
were subjected to heat shock for 30, 60, or 90 min. samples
were taken either immediately after heat shock (t0) or after a
4-h recovery at 37°c (t4) and analyzed for presence of phosphorylated jnk and p38. we found that phospho- xxxg1370xxx /2 was
induced after heat shock for both cell lines, but its phosphor-

lysates were subjected to immunoblotting for phospho-jnk followed by total
jnk (p- xxxg1370xxx /2 and  xxxg1370xxx /2) or phospho-p38 followed by total p38 (p-p38 and
p38). (b) a culture of ew36 cells was subjected to heat shock for 60 min. an
aliquot was taken immediately after heat shock (0 h recovery). incubation was
continued at 37°c and aliquots taken at 2, 4, and 6 h and subjected to
immunoblotting for p- xxxg1370xxx /2 and hsp72. the relative decrease in the signal
for phospho- xxxg1370xxx /2 and increase for hsp72, compared with the control
culture, is indicated below each lane.

ylation was transient in ew36 cells, resulting in a substantially
reduced signal at 4 h. this transient phosphorylation of jnk in
ew36 is consistent with the results shown in fig. 3b. in that
experiment, arsenite was added to cultures 4 h post-heat shock
and cultures were analyzed 2 h later, for a total of 6 h post-heat
shock. those samples showed no detectable signal for phospho-jnk. in contrast to jnk, the level of phospho-p38 increased over the 4-h recovery period, most notably in the 60and 90-min heat-shocked cultures.
a more detailed analysis of jnk phosphorylation in the
hours following heat shock revealed a progressive decline in
the level of phospho- xxxg1370xxx /2 in ew36 cells (fig. 5b). in
contrast, the level of hsp72, the major inducible form of
human hsp70, steadily increased during this period, indicating
that the ew36 cells have an apparently normal heat-shock
response. importantly, maximal sensitization to apoptosis by

sek1 after exposure to hyperthermia is prolonged by skf treatment. (a)
cultures of ew36 cells, with or without skf (hs ⫹ skf and hs – skf,
respectively) were subjected to heat shock for 60 min. an aliquot was taken
immediately after heat shock (0-h recovery). incubation was continued at 37°c
and aliquots were taken at 1, 2, 3, and 4 h and subjected to immunoblotting for
p- xxxg1370xxx /2 and p-sek. (b) cultures of ew36 cells were exposed to arsenite
alone (as) at the indicated concentrations, pretreated with skf for 4 h prior to
arsenite addition (skf ⫹ as), or pretreated with heat shock with skf present
during the 4-h recovery (hs ⫹ skf ⫹ as). aliquots were taken at 2 h
following addition of arsenite, and lysates were subjected to immunoblotting
for phosphorylated sek1 (p-sek) and jnk (p- xxxg1370xxx /2) and for induction of
c-jun at 24 h. fold increase in signal over control is indicated below each lane.

hyperthermia occurred during the first few hours following
shock, during the period of transient jnk phosphorylation, but
prior to extensive accumulation of hsp72.
further experiments revealed a difference in the duration of
jnk phosphorylation in ew36 cultures exposed to heat shock
alone or in the presence of skf (fig. 6a). a comparison of
phospho- xxxg1370xxx /2 levels during the first 4 h following heat
shock revealed that skf-treated cells had a prolonged period
of jnk phosphorylation compared with cells treated with hyperthermia alone (fig. 6a; hs – skf compared with hs ⫹
skf). importantly, one of the kinases immediately upstream of
jnk, sek1, showed an identical pattern of transient phosphorylation following heat shock that was prolonged in the presence of the p38 inhibitor. moreover, we found that the phosphorylation of sek1 closely paralleled that of jnk in
sensitized ew36 cells (fig. 6b). sensitized cultures showed a
progressive lowering of the threshold concentration of arsenite
required for phosphorylation of both kinases at 2 h, along with
induction of c-jun at 24 h, after treatment with arsenite alone
(as), pretreatment with skf (skf ⫹ as), or pretreatment with
heat shock and skf (hs ⫹ skf ⫹ as). together, these data
indicate that persistent activation of the jnk pathway is in-

the bl cell lines used in this study show significant differences in their propensity to undergo apoptosis after exposure to
sodium arsenite, with st486 cells being highly sensitive and
ew36 cells comparatively resistant. importantly, arsenite induced growth arrest to a similar extent in both cell lines. these
data, together with previous published studies (o’brien et al.,
2001), suggest that differential sensitivity between these bl
cell lines is attributable to specific differences in their propensity to signal, initiate, and/or execute the apoptotic pathways.
in this study, we found that the sensitive bl cell line st486
showed differences in the activation of specific components of
the map kinase signal transduction pathways compared with
the relatively resistant ew36 cell line. specifically, our data
show that only st486 cells undergo arsenite-induced apoptosis
in the absence of jnk pathway activation. this is evidenced at
the lower concentrations of arsenite at which morphological
apoptosis and parp cleavage were detected in the absence of
jnk phosphorylation and c-jun induction. at higher arsenite
concentrations, phospho-jnk was detected, but apoptosis occurred rapidly, prior to the induction of c-jun. this contrasts
with the ew36 cell line, which showed clear concentrationand time-dependent association of jnk phosphorylation and
c-jun induction with parp cleavage and morphological
apoptosis. importantly, even in sensitized ew36 cells, in
which cell death was induced at the lower arsenite concentrations, apoptosis was always associated with jnk/c-jun activation/induction. in addition, our data suggest a requirement for
activation of jnk and the subsequent induction of c-jun, or
other downstream products of this pathway, in arsenite-induced apoptosis in ew36 cells, as the ap-1 inhibitor oleandrin
blocked both c-jun induction and parp cleavage.
sodium arsenite has multiple targets in cells, with the ability
to directly affect mitochondrial function, increase levels of
reactive oxygen species, and induce protein damage, primarily
by interaction with sulfhydryl groups (cavigelli et al., 1996;
chen et al., 1998; larochette et al., 1999). at present, we do
not know which of these potentially cytotoxic activities is
primarily responsible for activation of jnk in the bl cell lines,
nor do we know the pathways involved in the jnk-independent induction of apoptosis in st486 cells. however, it is
possible that st486 cells are susceptible to mitochondrial
effects of arsenite, whereas ew36 cells, which overexpress
bcl-2, are not. we have previously shown that st486 cells
rapidly undergo mitochondrial depolarization followed by
apoptosis induction after exposure to several mitochondrial
toxicants, including compounds that inhibit electron transport
or uncouple oxidative phosphorylation (o’brien et al., 2001).
in contrast, the ew36 cell line was refractory to mitochondrial
depolarization and resistant to apoptosis by these agents. sim-

ilar to low concentrations of arsenite, apoptosis induction by
mitochondrial toxicants in st486 cells occurred in the absence
of jnk phosphorylation. hence, it is possible that ew36 cells
are refractory to the mitochondrial effects of arsenite, but
sensitive to its other activities, such as the induction of protein
damage or the generation of reactive oxygen species— conditions that can potentially activate the jnk pathway.
although some apoptosis-inducing treatments have been
reported to downregulate bcl-2 or inactivate it by phosphorylation (akao et al., 1998; hossain et al., 2000; srivastava et al.,
1999), we did not observe a change in bcl-2 levels or in the
electrophoretic mobility of the bcl-2 protein following treatment of ew36 cells with arsenite. in addition, we did not
detect changes in the ratio of bax/bcl-2 following treatment by
arsenite alone or in combination with any of the sensitizing
treatments (data not shown). thus, if jnk-pathway activation
is responsible for overcoming bcl-2–mediated resistance in
ew36 cells, it does not appear to do so by directly inactivating
this protein or affecting the bax/bcl-2 ratio.
we found that treatment with nonlethal hyperthermia sensitized ew36 cells to apoptosis induction by subsequent exposure to arsenite, effectively lowering the threshold concentration required for morphological apoptosis and for parp
cleavage. published studies show that many cell lines, when
subjected to a prior nonlethal heat shock, acquire tolerance to
subsequent, normally lethal heat stress in addition to treatment
with a variety of chemicals. however, such acquisition of
thermotolerance depends on the accumulation of stress proteins
such as hsp72 and hsp27 (gabai et al., 1997, 2000; mosser et
al., 1997; samali and cotter, 1996; samali et al., 2001). in our
study, ew36 cells were exposed to arsenite shortly after heat
shock, prior to the accumulation of high levels of stress proteins, but during a period of transient jnk phosphorylation.
this transient activation of jnk after heat shock alone was not
sufficient to induce elevated levels of c-jun protein or to induce
apoptosis. however, our data suggest that the introduction of a
second stress (such as sodium arsenite, which also activates
jnk) pushed the cells over a threshold, resulting in sustained
activation of the pathway. this enforced activation of jnk is
likely responsible for the synergistic effect of the two stresses
on apoptosis induction. moreover, it is consistent with studies
that show that the duration of jnk activation, as opposed to its
magnitude of induction, is a key factor in determining whether
cells undergo apoptosis by numerous stimuli, including exposure to uv irradiation,  xxxg2296xxx , and hyperthermia
(chen et al., 1996; volloch et al., 2000; westwick et al.,
1994).
induction of phospho-jnk in cells may be achieved in two
ways: by activation of upstream kinases or by inhibition of
jnk phosphatases. arsenite has been reported to act in both
ways, with several upstream kinases serving as potential targets (cavigelli et al., 1996; hossain et al., 2000; meriin et al.,
1999; porter et al., 1999), and with a sulfhydryl-containing
jnk phosphatase being especially sensitive to inhibition by

this toxicant (cavigelli et al., 1996). in contrast to arsenite,
published studies show that the primary mechanism underlying
jnk pathway activation by hyperthermia is mediated by inhibition of one or more jnk phosphatases. such phosphatase
inhibition results in a reduction in the rate of jnk dephosphorylation and subsequent accumulation in the levels of phosphojnk (meriin et al., 1999; palacios et al., 2001). consequently,
these increased phospho-jnk levels are observed after heat
shock in the absence of increased phosphorylation of upstream
kinases.
at present, we cannot exclude the possibility that the activity
of a jnk phosphatase is in part responsible for the transient
nature of jnk phosphorylation following heat shock in ew36
cells. indeed, we did observe an inverse relationship between
the reduction in the level of phospho-jnk and increase in the
level of hsp72 during the recovery period. among the many
antiapoptotic functions described for hsp72 is its ability to
stabilize jnk phosphatase (gabai et al., 2000; yaglom et al.,
1999). thus, an increase in hsp72 may lead to the stabilization
of jnk phosphatase, along with a concurrent reduction in the
level of phosphorylated kinase. however, our data also provide
evidence for heat shock-induced activation of the jnk pathway
via upstream signals as well.
we found that at least one of the kinases immediately
upstream of jnk, sek1, is phosphorylated in ew36 cells
following exposure to hyperthermia as well as to arsenite.
importantly, as for jnk, sek1 was only transiently activated
after heat shock in ew36; pretreatment of ew36 cells with the
p38 inhibitor skf prolonged the period of jnk and sek1
phosphorylation similarly. thus, our data suggest that b-lineage cells may differ from other cell types, in that upstream
signals are involved in activation of the jnk pathway by
hyperthermia. furthermore, sensitization of cells by either heat
shock, p38 kinase inhibition, or the combined treatment, also
involves upstream signaling events that lead to the persistent
activation of the jnk pathway, along with the progressive
lowering of the threshold of arsenite required for sek1 and
jnk phosphorylation and c-jun induction.
the nature of the upstream signal responsible for the activation of sek/jnk is presently unknown. possibilities include
the generation of reactive oxygen species and/or the activation
of cellular death receptors. indeed, reactive oxygen species are
known inducers of the jnk pathway, and hyperthermia has
been shown to induce apoptosis in hematopoietic cells by
increasing the production of ligands for fas and tumor necrosis
factor (farris et al., 1998; katschinski et al., 1999). the
potential contribution of these pathways in jnk activation and
apoptosis induction in bl cells is a subject for further investigation, as is the mechanism underlying the enhancement of
jnk pathway activation by inhibition of p38.
like the jnk pathway, the p38 pathway is commonly associated with induction of apoptosis. however, several studies
show that its inhibition may also result in an increase in
apoptosis. inhibition of p38 in jurkat cells with sb2 also

arsenite-induced apoptosis in b-lymphoma cells

potentiated apoptosis induced by  xxxd3135xxx  or uv irradiation
(nemoto et al., 1998). by overexpressing different p38 isoforms, that study showed that the antiapoptotic activity of this
pathway was attributed to p38b. however, the potential involvement of the jnk pathway was not addressed. in addition,
the different isoforms of p38 have been shown to either inhibit
or potentiate apoptosis in cardiomyocytes and in other cell
types (wang et al., 1998; zechner et al., 1998). our data
suggest that the p38 pathway itself may be part of a stress
response that, when inhibited, sensitizes cells to apoptosis
induction. the low but detectable level of p38 activity we
observed even in unstressed cells may be a target for sensitization mediated by skf treatment alone, which is further
enhanced by additional stresses that activate this pathway.
understanding the basis for cellular variation in susceptibility or resistance to apoptosis induction and identifying novel
pathways in which this sensitivity may be modulated is important to assess the consequences of chemical exposure and to
identify ways in which cells are sensitized to chemically induced apoptosis. several studies have identified the jnk pathway as an important component of arsenite-induced signaling
and apoptosis induction. however, many of these studies used
concentrations substantially higher than those used here. our
study shows that discrete thresholds exist for the activation of
proapoptotic signaling pathways in b-lineage cells that can be
revealed only at lower arsenite concentrations. moreover, our
data invoke the contribution of jnk-dependent and jnk-independent pathways to apoptosis induction in bl cells and the
underscore the utility of the bl cell lines for investigating the
roles of these pathways in regulating the sensitivity of blineage lymphocytes to chemically induced apoptosis and other
cytotoxic effects.
