nonsmall-cell lung cancer (nsclc) is not generally a chemosensitive tumor, and the mechanism of
resistance to the relevant anticancer drugs has not been fully elucidated. solamargine (sm), the major
steroidal glycoalkaloids extracted from the chinese herb solanum, inhibits the growth of human
tumor cells. we have previously demonstrated that sm regulates  xxxg2296xxx  receptors
(tnfrs)- and mitochondria-mediated pathways and sensitizes nsclc cells to initiate apoptosis.
interestingly, this investigation reveals that sm up-regulated fas expression and down-regulated the
expression of her2, whose overexpression is associated with resistance to drugs, and promotes chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in nsclc a549 and h441 cells. after treatment with sm, the expression of her2 mrna was correlated with the expression of topoisomerase iia ( xxxg2311xxx ) mrna. the
combinatory use of low concentrations of sm with low-toxic  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2008xxx 
accelerated apoptotic cell death. therefore, the downregulation of the her2 and  xxxg2311xxx  expression
by sm with  xxxd2008xxx  may partially explain the sm and  xxxd2008xxx  cytotoxicity synergy effect in
nsclc. results of this study suggest that sm induces fas and tnfr-induced nsclc cell apoptosis
and reduces her2 expression. these findings provide the synergistic therapeutic interaction between
sm and  xxxd2008xxx , suggesting that such combinations may be effectively exploited in future human
cancer clinical trials.

differ, perhaps because of their susceptibility to apoptosis
[1]. nsclc, the most prevalent subtype, is less sensitive to
apoptosis, making it more resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy and causing the treatment of patients to fail, whereas
sclc is more susceptible to apoptosis [2]. adenocarcinoma is the most common of the nsclc subtypes, and its
frequency is rising in the world [3]. therefore, nsclc of
the human adenocarcinoma a549 and h441 cells were
studied and the actions of chemotherapy were also illustrated.
aberrations in the apoptotic signaling promote tumorigenesis and underlie resistance of human tumors to anticancer agents.  xxxg764xxx /fas, a member of the tumor necrosis
factor receptor (tnfr) superfamily, is critical in apoptotic
caspase cascade signaling in various cells [4]. fas-signaling
may be caused by the ligation of the fas receptors by the
 xxxd3135xxx  (fasl) or by anti-fas antibodies. several tumor
cells can escape fas-mediated cell death by modifying the
fas receptor associated with fasl expression including

lung cancer cells [5]. we have previously established that
solamargine (sm), a purified compound from solanum
plants, regulates the expressions of tnfrs and the mitochondrial-mediated pathway, and sensitizes lung cancer
cells to the initiation of apoptosis [6]. the binding of death
ligands to their receptors, including fas (for fasl) and
tnfrs (for tnf), triggers apoptosis by the recruitment of
the adaptor protein fas-associated death domain ( xxxg756xxx )/
tnfr-1-associated death domain (tradd), which promotes the recruitment of  xxxg342xxx  and -3, activating the
cell death pathway [7]. these results support the hypothesis
that sm may activate the fas pathway, which may affect the
chemosensitivity of nsclc a549 and h441 cells to anticancer agents.
the her2 oncogene (also known as c-erbb2) encodes a
185 kda transmembrane  xxxg2198xxx  with homology to
 xxxg682xxx  [8]. the amplification/
overexpression of the human her2 gene is commonly
observed in human cancer, including nsclc. it has been
shown to be associated with poor patient survival in
nsclc [9]. cellular and animal experiments have shown
that promoting the expression of the her2 gene can
increase tumorigenicity and experimental metastasis in
mouse embryo fibroblasts and human cancer cells [10].
furthermore, the overexpression of her2 in nsclc has
been recently reported to induce resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs such as cisplatin, doxorubicin, and  xxxd2008xxx 
[11]. the association of her2 overexpression in cancer
cells with malignant phenotypes and chemoresistance provides a plausible explanation for the poor clinical outcome
of patients with her2-overexpressing tumors [12], indicating that the downregulation of her2 in lung cancers may
prevent drug resistance.
 xxxd2008xxx  is a  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitor, and is
employed as a base for single or combination chemotherapy
to treat solid tumors, including nsclc [13]; however, the
development of drug resistance reduces its effectiveness.
factors that have been reported to affect resistance to  xxxd2008xxx  include the altered expression of  xxxg2312xxx  and
integrins, changes in glutathione levels [14] and the expression of membrane-associated pumps such as p-glycoprotein encoded by the multidrug resistance gene  xxxg10xxx  [15].
this study elucidates the success of chemotherapy that
utilizes sm and  xxxd2008xxx  for nsclc cells. (i) sm inhibits
the growth of a549 and h441 cells; upregulates the expression of fas, and downregulates the oncogene her2. (ii)
after treatment with sm, the mrna expression of her2 is
greatly significantly correlated with topoisomerase iia
( xxxg2311xxx ), and low concentrations of sm combination  xxxd2008xxx  caused significantly more apoptosis than either
drug treatment alone. therefore, the presented results suggest that sm upregulation of fas and downregulation of
her2 expressions simultaneously downregulate  xxxg2311xxx 
expression, the fact which may partially explain the synergy
of sm with  xxxd2008xxx  cytotoxicity in nsclc.

2 materials and methods
2.1 agents and cell culture
 xxxd2008xxx  was purchased from sigma chemical company
(st. louis, mo). sm was isolated from berries of solanum
incanum. sm was dissolved at a concentration of 60 lm in
100% dmso as stock solution.  xxxd2008xxx  (200 lm) was
prepared with ddh2o as stock solution. stock solution was
diluted to the desired final concentrations with growth
medium just before use. the final dmso or ddh2o concentration did not exceed 0.1%. the human adenocarcinoma cell lines a549 and h441 were cultured in medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (hazelton product, denver, pa, usa) and antibiotics (100 u/ml penicillin, 100 lg/ml streptomycin) at 378c in 5% co2; specifically a549 cells in f-12 medium (gibco, grand island,
ny) and h441 cells in rpmi 1640 medium (gibco).
2.2 assessment of cell viability and apoptosis
cells (16104 cells/well) were seeded in each 100 ll of 96well multidishes for at least 24 h prior to use. the cells were
treated with serial concentrations of agents for 18 h. the
effects on cell growth were examined by [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium] (mts) assay according to the
manufacturer’s procedure (celltiter 96tm aq, promega,
madison, wi). absorbance at 490 nm (a490) was measured
with an automated plate reader (dydatech, alexandria,
va). values are expressed as the percentage of mean cell
viability relative to the untreated cultures. the ic25 and ic50
were calculated from the drug concentration that induced
25 and 50% of cell survival rate. all determinations were
performed in triplicate and statistically analyzed by student’s t-test. to assess specific apoptosis, cells were treated
with sm (ic50),  xxxd2008xxx  (9.2 lm) alone or in combination for 18 h. cells were then fixed in 70% ethanol/pbs,
pelleted, and resuspended in buffer containing 200 lg/ml
 xxxg1963xxx  and 0.01 mg/ml  xxxd3027xxx  iodide. subg1-peak
was determined by flow cytometry analysis. the percentages of cells were determined using the winmdi software.
for fluorescent staining, after incubation with sm (ic50) for
18 h, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in saponin (0.1% v/v in pbs-bsa). the cell nuclei
were stained with 0.1 lg/ml of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi) (sigma) and inspected using a fluorescent
microscope.
2.3 rt-pcr and southern hybridization
rna preparations were extracted form the cells treated
with sm (ic50) for serial times using the qiagen rneasy kit
(hilden, germany), and rt-pcr was performed using 1 lg
of total cellular rna and the superscript cdna preampli-

fication system (clontech, palo alto, ca) in a perkinelmer amplification cycler (weiterstadt, germany). primers used were as follows: (i) fas (264 bp), 59-agcttggtctagagtgaaaa-39, 59-gaggcagaatcatgagatat-39; (ii) her2 (420 bp), 59-tgcggctcgtacacagggactt-39,
59-tgcggagaattcagacaccaact-39; (iii)  xxxg2311xxx  (596 bp), 59-gccctcctgctacacatttc-39, 59-aacacttgggctttacttcactt39. the rna used for reverse transcription was controlled
by the rt-pcr of human b-actin (286 bp) in the same conditions. the pcr conditions included an initial denaturation for 2 min at 958c, 29 cycles consisting of (i) 1 min
denaturation at 948c; (ii) 1 min primer annealing at 608c
for fas and her2, 548c for  xxxg2311xxx  and b-actin, respectively; (iii) 1 min elongation at 728c; and (d) one final step
of 5 min at 728c. the amplified rt-pcr products were
analyzed in 2% agarose gels and were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and photographed under uv illumination. for southern hybridization assay, cdna products
were electrophoresed on agarose gel and transferred onto
nylon membrane (biorad, richmond, usa). after prehybridization, the blot was hybridized with human monoclonal her2 probes labeled with [35s]-dctp using randomly
primed labeling procedure (promega).

separated by sds-page under reducing or nonreducing
conditions, and immunoblotted with anti-fas mab (r&d
systems, mn, usa), trastuzumab and anti-b-actin (sigma).
for immunofluorescence analysis, cell surface expressions
of her2 were analyzed by fluorescent staining and flow
cytometry. after incubation with sm (ic50) for 18 h, cells
were stained with trastuzumab in 1' pbs containing 0.5%
bsa (pbs-bsa) and 0.1% sodium azide (sigma–aldrich)
for 45 min at 48c. cells were then washed twice with cold
pbs and incubated with fitc-conjugated antihuman igg1
at 48c for 30 min. cells were washed with cold pbs and
fixed in 4% formalin. the cell nuclei were stained with
0.1 lg/ml of dapi and inspected using a fluorescent
microscope. two additional washing steps with cold pbs
were performed before the cells were analyzed by facscan
flow cytometer (becton–dickinson) using winmdi software.
2.5 statistical analysis
to evaluate the statistical significance of the difference of
all the values, statistical analysis was performed on the
means of the triplicates of at least three independent experiments using a student’s t-test. p values less than 0.05 was
considered significant for all tests.

2.4 detection of fas and her2 expressions
cells were treated with sm (ic50) for 18 h and the expressions of fas and her2 were studied after trypsinization.
the cell surface expression of her2 receptor was measured as the amount of selective binding sites for trastuzumab (1:100) (dako, carpinteria, ca), a humanized antiher2 antibody containing the murine antigen binding
loops and human variable region framework residues plus
human igg1 constant domains, followed by secondary
staining with an antibody reacting specifically with the fc
portion of the heavy chain of human igg1 (molecular
probes). for immunoblotting, cells were harvested, washed
with pbs, and incubated for 20 min at 48c in 1 ml of lysis
buffer containing 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 1% triton
x-100, 5 mm egta (ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-n,n,n9,n9-tetraacetic acid), 150 mm nacl, and
1 mm pmsf. cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation,

3 results
3.1 dose dependence of sm-induced apoptosis in
nsclc a549 and h441 cells
sm was extracted from a chinese herb, as reported above
[16]. figure 1a plots the effect of sm on the cell growth of
a549 and h441 cells, as determined by the mts assay. the
treatment of a549 and h441 cells with serial concentrations of sm for 18 h inhibited cell proliferation, which was
dose-dependent. the concentrations of sm that caused
50% cell death (ic50) were approximately 5.46 lm for
a549 and 5.85 lm for h441 cells. after incubation with
sm (ic50), the nuclei of a549 and h441 cells were stained
with dapi and exhibited typical nuclear condensation and
apoptotic bodies (fig. 1b).

figure 2. expression of fas on nsclc cells after sm treatment. a549 and h441 cells were treated with sm (ic50) for
various periods. the expressions of fas and b-actin on the
cells were determined by rt-pcr (a) and immunoblot analyses (b) using specific cdna primers and immunoblotting with
anti-fas mab and anti-b-actin, as described in section 2.

3.2 apoptosis of sm-induced nsclc cells
required fas expression
the apoptosis caused by chemotherapeutic agents can be
mediated by fas/fasl signaling pathway in numerous lung
cancers [7]. the modulation of fas expression in smtreated a549 and h441 cells was investigated. as presented
in fig. 2a, adding sm (ic50) up-regulated the gene expression of fas in a549 and h441 cells according to rt-pcr.
the results of immunoblot analysis of fas were consistent
with the levels of fas mrna and protein expression (fig.
2b). these results demonstrate that sm might predominantly induce the nsclc cells apoptosis through upregulation of fas expression.
3.3 effect of her2 downregulation on growth
inhibition by sm in nsclc cells
previous reports have demonstrated that her2 overexpression is correlated with resistance to drugs [11], indicating
that the down-regulation of her2 in tumors may cause
such resistance. the gene expression of her2 in a549 and
h441 cells with ic50 doses of sm was tested by rt-pcr
analysis followed by southern hybridization, to examine
the effect of sm on her2 that has been correlated with
metastatic potential. as displayed in figs. 3a and b, the
ratios of her2 to b-actin gene expressions revealed that
cells treated with sm exhibited a level of significance of
her2 expression lower than the untreated control. the
results were confirmed by immunoblot (fig. 3c) and the
binding of humanized anti-her2 antibodies (trastuzumab)
to the receptors on sm-treated cells by immunofluorescent
analysis and flow cytomerty (figs. 3d and e). similar
results for the downregulation of her2 receptor expres-

following sm treatment. (a) cells were treated with sm (ic50)
at various times. the expressions of her2 on cells were studied by rt-pcr (a), southern hybridization (b), immunoblot
(c), immunofluorescent analysis (d), and flow cytometry (e),
as described in section 2. the blank, the primary antibodies,
and the secondary antibodies were replaced with 16pbs
under the same conditions. data are representative of three
independent experiments.

sions upon exposure to sm in a549 and h441 cells were
obtained. taken together, these results indicated that sm
can reduce the gene and protein expressions of her2 in
nsclc cells.
3.4 sm-enhancement of  xxxd2008xxx  cytotoxicity is
associated with downregulation of  xxxg2311xxx 
expression
one of several mechanisms that may explain the resistance
of her2-overexpressing tumors to  xxxd2008xxx  is coregulation or coamplification of her2 and  xxxg2311xxx  [17]. following treatment with sm (ic50) to study a possible correlation
between mrna expression of her2 and  xxxg2311xxx , an rtpcr approach, using primers specific for her2 and
 xxxg2311xxx  (fig. 4a), was performed. sm down-regulated the
gene expression of  xxxg2311xxx  in a549 and h441 cells, as
determined by comparison with the control, and a consider-

figure 4. sm-enhanced  xxxd2008xxx -induced cell cytotoxicity in nsclc cells. (a) expression of  xxxg2311xxx  on a549 and h441 cells after
sm treatment. a constant amount of sm (ic50) was added to the cells for various intervals. the expressions of  xxxg2311xxx  on cells were
determined by rt-pcr. (b) the susceptibility of a549 and h441 cells to  xxxd2008xxx  was improved by adding sm. constant concentrations of sm (ic25 and ic50) and  xxxd2008xxx  (3.6 and 9.2 lm) alone or in combination were added to a549 and h441 cells for 18 h.
the cytotoxicity was determined by mts assay. each value is the mean ( sd of the percentage cell viability from triplicate determinations. *p <0.05 compared to the control values. (c) percentage of cells in which apoptosis induced by sm (ic50) and  xxxd2008xxx 
(9.2 lm) alone or in combination for 18 h, as analyzed by flow cytometry for dna fragmentation using nuclear staining with  xxxd3027xxx  iodide. the percentage of the specific apoptotic subg1-peak was calculated using winmdi software. the results are obtained
from a representative experiment of three independent experiments.

able correlation was obtained between the mrna expression of  xxxg2311xxx  and her2.
the treatment of a549 and h441 cells with sm alone or
in combination with  xxxd2008xxx  was observed to elucidate
whether chemosensitivity to  xxxd2008xxx  can be influenced
by the inhibition of her2 and/or  xxxg2311xxx  (fig. 4b). surprisingly, low concentrations of sm plus  xxxd2008xxx  inhibited the proliferation of a549 cells as potently as did drug
treatment alone. similar results were observed with h441
cells. these results were confirmed by the appearance of a
subg1 population, revealed by flow cytometry; the combination of sm with  xxxd2008xxx  resulted in more beneficial
apoptotic cell death than with individual agents alone (fig.
4c). hence, the results herein suggest that the downregulation of her2 and  xxxg2311xxx  expressions by sm with  xxxd2008xxx  may partially explain the synergistic cytotoxicity effect
in nsclc.

4 discussion
using herbs to treat malignant diseases has been dramatically rising in recent years. members of the solanaceae

i

family of plants synthesize secondary metabolites such as
glycoalkaloids and polypenols, presumably to protect themselves against phytopathogens. these plants include potatoes, tomatoes, and eggplants. sm is a major glycoalkaloid
that is found in eggplants and at least 100 other solanum
species [18]. this investigation presents the action mechanism of sm in nsclc a549 and h441 cells.
a role of the fas/fasl signaling system in apoptosis
induced by chemotherapy has been proposed for some lung
cancer cell types. the expression of fas and fasl on the
surface of nsclc cells is up-regulated after exposure to
anticancer agents, and apoptosis is induced in some cell
lines upon exposure to the fas agonistic mab [19]. the
overexpression of the her2 oncogene is commonly associated with several cancers, including lung cancer. a large
body of evidence indicates that her2 overexpression is
associated with elevated tumorigenicity in nude mice xenograft models, enhanced metastatic potential, increased
resistance to ligation of death receptors by tnf, fasl, and
trail, and in particular circumstances, resistance to chemotherapy [20]. accordingly, cancer cells that overexpress
her2 are therefore an excellent target for the development
of anticancer therapies. for instance, an anti-her2 anti-

body (trastuzumab, herceptintm) has been used clinically
as a potent growth inhibitor of such breast and lung cancer
cells [21], and previous research has demonstrated that the
overexpression of her2 upregulates p21waf1 and leads to
resistance by these cancer cells to taxol [22]. the dnabinding  xxxg735xxx , which is encoded by a previously
isolated gene of the ets family, specifically targeted a dna
sequence on the her2 promoter and down-regulated the
promoter activity. the expression of  xxxg735xxx  resulted in the
preferential inhibition of cell growth and the development
of a tumor by her2-overexpressing cancer cells [23]. antisense oligonucleotides have been adopted to suppress the in
vitro proliferation of human cancer cells in which her2 is
amplified and tumorigenicity is inhibited in vivo [24].
moreover, previous studies have shown that akt was constitutively activated in her2-overexpressing cancer cells and
that akt/nf-jb activity was required to establish the resistance of these cells to tnf-induced apoptosis [25]. hence,
her2-overexpressing cancer cells are more resistant to
tnf-induced apoptosis, leading to poor prognosis and
shortening the survival time of patients. our laboratory has
recently established that sm can modulate tnfrs- and
mitochondria-related bcl-2/ xxxg251xxx  and bax expression, and
overcome the resistance to tnfs and cisplatin in lung cancer cells [26]. interestingly, in this study, sm’s upregulation
of fas and its downregulation of her2 expression inhibited
cell growth, according to rt-pcr, southern hybridization,
immunoblot, immunofluorescent analysis, and flow cytometry. these findings suggest that sm-enhanced sensitization to tnfr- and fas-mediated pathway was associated
with the suppression of her2 expression and the induction
of cell death in nsclc a549 and h441 cells.
cytotoxic chemotherapy remains an important part of
optimal therapy for patients in all stages of cancers, but its
use is limited by toxicity, nonspecificity, inevitable development of resistance, and serious consequences on the
patients’ quality of life [27]. current chemotherapeutic
agents can not only kill cancer cells, but also express toxicity for normal cells [28]. recent strategies including coadministered modulating agents, hammerhead ribozymes and
antisense oligonucleotides may increase the specificity in
cell targeting. the strategies may be used to reduce drug
resistance and increase drug bioavailability to improve the
profile of chemotherapeutic efficacy versus toxicity [29].
chemotherapeutic agents can compromise the survival of
the graft. drugs that are effective at low doses could therefore, not only give fewer side effects, but also provide a better graft survival [30]. in this regard, this study uses sm to
upregulate the fas death receptor and downregulate the
her2 resistant gene, and consequently enhanced the efficacy of  xxxd2008xxx  in nsclc cells. thus, the effective dose
of  xxxd2008xxx  in the treatment of nsclc may be reduced.
the mechanism by which her2 may be associated with
resistance to chemotherapy is coampliferation or coregulation with  xxxg2311xxx . the chromosomal location of both her2

i

and  xxxg2311xxx  is 17q21–22. amplifications occur over large
segments of the chromosome and may comprise many
mega bases.  xxxg2311xxx  was found to be coamplified in 12% of
her2; other investigators have obtained similar results
[31]. therefore, a subgroup of patients with her2 overexpression is likely to exhibit a high  xxxg2311xxx  activity. a previous investigation reported that tumor cell lines that are
resistant to topoisomerase-targeting drugs, such as doxorubicin with down-regulated  xxxg2311xxx  can simultaneously
downregulate the oncogene her2 and thus become sensitive to tnf and fasl [32]. this study demonstrated that
low concentrations of sm augment  xxxd2008xxx  cytotoxicity,
achieving a greater therapeutic effect than that expected by
the simple addition of the effects of the component drugs.
this result is associated with the downregulation of coregulation and the coamplification of her2 and  xxxg2311xxx  expression, which potentially result in prominent synergistic
effects on the a549 and h441 cells. these findings provide
additional insight into the synergistic therapeutic interaction between sm and  xxxd2008xxx , suggesting that such combinations can be successfully exploited in future human
clinical trials.
