the role of renal chloride channel mutations in
kidney stone disease and nephrocalcinosis

rajesh v. thakker

recent advances in molecular biology have characterised
a new class of chloride channels (clcs) that are referred to
as voltage-gated clcs. [o date nine such voltage-gated
clcs (clgc-1 to clc-7, clg-ka and clc-kb, which are
encoded by the genes clcn17 10 clcn/,  xxxg473xxx  and
clc-kb, respectively) have been identified in mammals.
mutations in two of these, clc-5 and glc-kb, have been
defined in the hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis disorders of
dents disease and a form of bartter’s syndrome,
respectively. in addition, other forms of bartter's syndrome
have been defined with mutations involving the
bumetanide-sensitive sodium-potassium-chloride
cotransporter ( xxxg2078xxx ) and the  xxxg1232xxx   xxxg1249xxx .
finally, mutations of the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride
cotransporter ( xxxg2080xxx ) are associated with gitelman’s
syndrome, in which hypocalciuria and hypomagnesaemia are
notable features. these molecular genetic studies have
increased our understanding of the renal tubular mechanisms
that regulate mineral homeostasis. curr opin: nephrol. hypertens

introduction

recent studies have shed light on some. of the renal
tubular mechanisms regulating electrolyte homeostasis
[1°,2°,3%*.4°*|] and, in particular, those that regulate chlor-
ide, which is the most abundant anion in the extracellular
fluid (ece) compartment:. [he renal tubules reclaim
more than 99% of the 180 livres of fluid filtered through
the glomeruli each day, and a directional transport of ions
and water across the renal tubular-cells from the apical
(lumen) to the basolateral (blood) side (fig..1) is thus
required. the. directional transport of chloride involves
chloride. channels and chloride cotransporters, and our
understanding of these has been increased by. studies
of hereditary disorders of electrolyte homeostasis
(3pr de". 5--7,8°,9, 10° 11°". 12"). thus, chloride transport
abnormalities in. dent's disease, bartter’s syndrome and
gitelman’s syndrome have been defined, and these will
be reviewed.

dent's disease

four disorders of hereditary hypercaleiure nephrolithiasis
(kidney stones), that have been referred to: as dent's
disease [13,14], x-linked recessive nephrolithiasis (xrn)
[15,16], a-linked recessive hypophosphataemic tickets
(slrh)(17] and the idiopathic low. molecular weight
proteinuria of japanese children. (jilmwp) (18), have
been reported to be due to mutations of the x-linked
renal-specific, voltage-gated chloride channel clc-5
(table 1, and see below) [5,10°.11°°,12°.14,19.20]. all
these four diseases have features in common, and they
represent renal tubular disorders that are characterised by
low molecular. weight proteinuria (lmiwp), bypercal-
ciuria, nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis and renal fauure.
in addition, other renal proximal tubular defects, which
include amino-aciduna, phosphaturia, glycosuria, kaliur-
esis, uricosuria and an acquired impairment of urinary
acidification may also occur [13,15,17,18]. however. there
are differences between these disorders; for example,
rickets has been a particular feature of dent's disease and
aulrh, but not xrn or jilmwp, and severe renal failure
has been a feature of dent's disease and xrn [13-18].
dent's disease, xrn and xlrh were mapped to xp11.22
[14,160.17], anda microdeletion in one patient with dent's
disease facilitated the isolation and characterisation of
a renal chloride channel gene, clon5 [14,21,22]. dna
sequence analyses have detected different clons
mutations that consist of nonsense. thissense, splice
site, insertional and deletional mutations, in patients

with these four hypercalciuric: nephrolithiasis disorders
(9,10°*,11°,12°,19,20], together: with another form of
a hereditary renal tubular acidosis [23]; thereby establish-
ing its causal role in these diseases [24,25°]. in addition,
heterologous expression of the wild type clons gene or
its mutants in aezopus oocytes demonstrated that the wild
type channel, clc-5, conducted outwardly directed
chloride currents that were either abolished or markedly
reduced by the mutations, thereby demonstrating the
function importance of such mutations (9,10%*,112*].
the common genetic aetiology of clons mutations and
the phenotypic similarities between all these syndromes
indicated that they were variants of one disorder, and it
has been proposed to refer to them collectively as dent’s
disease [11°°. 12°].

these results indicated that clcns5 encodes a chloride
channel, glcg-5, whose functional-loss results in a gener-
alised proximal tubular defect (ve. fanconi syndrome)
that is associated with the hypercalciuria and neph-
rolithiasis of dent's disease 124]. however, the mecha-
nisms whereby a loss of chis renal clc leads to hypercal-
ciuria and the proximal tubular defects remains to be
elucidated. the reabsorption of filtered protein occurs in
the proximal tubule, whereas that of calcium occurs in the
proximal tubule, thick ascending limb of henle’s loop and

the distal cubule. one possibility is chat a loss of clc-5
function in the proximal tubule may lead to a decrease in
chloride reabsorption which in turn results in decreased
calcium reabsorption [24,26]. llowever, this does not ex-
plain the abnormal excretion of low molecular weight
proteins which are specifically absorbed in the proximal
tubule by endocytosis and transported in an acidic
vacuolar-lysosomal system [24,27]. a loss of clc function
in this system would prevent the dissipation of the charge
that is generated by the electrogenic hydrogen-at pase
pump for the provision of the acidic environment. how-
ever, these possibilities need to be explored, and the
identification of the specific segments of the nephron that
express clouns will represent an important srep in this
pathway towards understanding further the role and func-
tion of clc-5 in the aetiology of hypercalciuria and
renal stones.

voltage-gated chloride channel (clc)

gene family

the clcs represent the most recently discovered of the
three structurally defined classes of chloride channel
[4%*]; these are the extracellular ligand-eared receptor
chloride channel (e.g. the glycine and y-aminobutyric
acid-a receptors) [28,29], the cystic fibrosis transmem-
brane conductance. regulator chloride channel [30] and
the clcs. the glycine and y- xxxd2177xxx -a recep-
tors, which probably have four transmembrane domains
and may function as pentamers, conduct chloride ions and
are mainly involved in neuronal inhibition. the cystic
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr),
which is a member of the superfamily of atp-binding
cassette (abc) transporters and has 12 putative trans-
membrane domains arranged in two separate blocks with
two cyclic nucleotide binding domains and a regulatory
region, functions as a cyclic-amp regulated chloride chan-
nel. the glcs, which are structurally unrelated to the
other ion channels and form the only known large family
(table 1) of chloride channel, consist of about 12 trans-
membrane domains {9,21,22,31,32], and the correct num-
ber and topology of these is being established [33°*. 34°"),
‘che first member, designated clc-0, was cloned in 1990
from the electric organ of torpedo marmorata [31], and
nine different clcs (clc-1 to clc-7, and  xxxg473xxx  and
clg-kb encoded by genes clon/ to glonz and cln-
ka and clon-ko, respectively) have been identified in
mammals [21,32,35]. heterologous expression in nezopus
oocytes has revealed that the chloride channels clg-0,
clc-1,  xxxg472xxx  and clg-5 conduct chloride currents char
are outwardly rectifying and time-dependent, and with
a conductivity sequence that prefers chloride to iodide
[9,10°*,31,32,33°* 34°° 36.37], the clcs are important
for the control of membrane excitability, transepithelial
transport and possibly regulation of cell volume [22].
cls are known to function as multimeric complexes
and recent studies [36,37] have revealed that clc-o ts

“in-sits hybridisation studies have detected clc-5 expression consistently in ihe type a intercalated cells of the collecting duct, but only occasionally in.the proximal tubule (42).

a homodimer with two largely independent pores. the
clc genes are expressed in a variety of tissues (table 1)
and only clon/, clons and clc-kb have to date been
reported to have disease-associated mutations. [4°],
thus, mutations of clon/ are associated with the my-
otonia disorders of thomsen and becker [38-40]; muta-
tions of clcns are associated with the hereditary neph-
rolithiasis disorders of dent's disease [9.10% 11**] (see
above); and mutations of clco-a&é are associated: with
a form of bartter’s syndrome [3°*] (sce below).

bartter’s and gitelman’s syndromes

bartter's syndrome 18 an autosomal recessive disorder of
electrolyte homeostasis that is characterised by hy-
pokalaemic alkalosis, renal salt wasting that may lead to
hypotension, hyper-reninaemic hyperaldosteronism, in-
creased utinary prostaglandin excretion, and hypercal-
ciuna with nephrocalcinosis [3°°,5]. however, a subset of
such patients with hypokalaemic alkalosis have hypocal-
cluria with hypomagnaesmia, and this is referred to. as
gitelman’s syndrome [6]. kindreds with gitelman’s
syndrome may have mutations involving the thiazide-
sensitive sodium-chlonde cotransporter ( xxxg2080xxx ) [6], and
studies of kindreds with bartters syndrome have demon-
strated genetic heterogeneity with mutations involv-
ing the bumetanide-sensitive sodium-potassium-chloride
( xxxg2078xxx ) cotransporter [5] (fig. 1), the inwardly rectify-
ing renal  xxxg1232xxx  (roma) [7,8°], or the volr-
age-pated chloride channel, clc-kb [3°°] (table 1).
bartter’s syndrome patients with vacc2,  xxxg1249xxx  or clg-
a@ mutations bave a similar phenotype with one notable
exception: nephrocalcinosis was absent. in all the 17 pa-
tients reported to date with clc-ad mutations, despite
the occurrence of hypercalciuna in 65% of them [3°*].

‘the selective localisation of the chloride transporter,
 xxxg2078xxx , and the chloride channel clcg-kkb on the apical
and basolateral membranes, respectively, of the thick as-
cending limb cells (fig. 1) of henle’s loops enables the
directional transport of chloride. chloride is reabsorbed

from the tubular lumen across the apical membrane by. the
 xxxg2078xxx  cotransporter, the activity of which is maintained
by. recycling of potassium by rome [7.8%]. this leads to
an accumulation of intracellular chloride, which leaves the
cell via the chloride channel,  xxxg877xxx -kb [3°*.4 be]: which is
located in the basolateral membrane and enters the blood,
‘thus, vectorial transport is achieved by the thick ascend-
ing limb cell. interestingly, the opposite arrangement of
chloride cotransporters and channels on the basolateral
and apical membranes, respectively, would be predicted
to lead to chloride secretion rather than reabsorption.
