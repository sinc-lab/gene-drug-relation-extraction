receptors*

abstract. a recognition site for benzodiazepines structurally different from that linked to various 7- xxxd2177xxx  a
(gabaa) receptor subtypes is located on the outer mitochondrial
membranes of steroidogenic cells. this protein has been signified
to be important in the regulation of steroid biosynthesis. because
of its location it is designated herein as the mitochondrial
benzodiazepine receptor (mbr). a putative endogenous ligand
for mbr is the peptide diazepam binding inhibitor (dbi), previously shown to displace drugs from mbr and to be expressed
and stored in steroidogenic cells rich in mbr. the two model
systems used to study steroidogenic regulation by dbi were the
y-l adrenocortical and ma-10 leydig cell lines previously shown
to be applicable in studies of mitochondrial steroidogenesis. both
cell lines contain dbi as well as dbi processing products,
including the dbi fragments that on reverse phase hplc coelute with the naturally occurring triakontatetraneuropeptide
[ttn; dbi-(17-50)] and octadecaneuropeptide [dbi-(33-50)].
when dbi purified from rat brain was added to mitochondria

prepared from y-l and ma-10 cell lines, it increased the rates
of pregnenolone formation in a dose-related manner. in both
cell lines, maximal stimulation (3-fold) of mitochondrial steroidogenesis was obtained with 0.33 nm dbi, with an ec60 of
approximately 0.1 ^m. however, dbi concentrations higher than
1 mm caused a smaller increase in pregnenolone formation.
flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine that binds with high nanomolar affinity to mbr, was recently shown to act as an antagonist
of acth and lh/hcg-induced steroidogenesis and was found
in the present studies to inhibit dbi-stimulated mitochondrial
steroidogenesis. during the incubation with mitochondria, dbi
was partially processed to different peptide fragments, including
octadecaneuropeptide and ttn. to determine whether dbi
processing products influence mitochondrial steroid biosynthesis, several dbi fragments and other peptides structurally
unrelated to dbi were tested. among these, only ttn stimulated mitochondrial steroid synthesis in a dose-dependent manner similar to dbi. (endocrinology 129: 1481-1488, 1991)

t

he initial metabolic step in steroid biosynthesis
is the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone,
which occurs in inner mitochondrial membranes where
the cytochrome p-450 side-chain cleavage enzyme is
located (1, 2). cholesterol is transported from intracellular stores to the outer mitochondrial membrane and
subsequently to the inner membrane, where it is metabolized to pregnenolone. the rate-limiting step in steroid
biosynthesis is not this enzymatic conversion, but,
rather, the transport of cholesterol from the outer region
to a specific location in the inner mitochondrial membrane (1-5). this transport is stimulated by physiological
stimuli that increase steroidogenesis, such as acth and

lh for adrenocortical and testicular leydig cells, respectively (1-5).
we have recently demonstrated that the peripheraltype or  xxxg2342xxx  (mbr),
localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane and
abundant in steroidogenic tissues (adrenocortical and
testicular leydig cells), is involved in the regulation of
steroid biosynthesis (6, 7). the precise locus of action of
this receptor-mediated event was determined to be at the
level of the intramitochondrial cholesterol transport (8).
moreover, we have recently shown that mbr participates in the regulation of the hormone-stimulated steroidogenesis because the weak agonist flunitrazepam, by
specifically binding to mbr, antagonizes the steroidogenic effect of acth and lh in both y-l adrenocortical
and ma-10 leydig mouse tumor cell lines (9).
the demonstration that mitochondrial steroidogenesis
can be regulated by the occupancy of mbr with specific
benzodiazepine ligands has suggested that mbr may be

dbi and mitochondrial steroidogenesis

the target for endogenous ligands that mediate the action
of acth and lh and act in a manner similar to that of
benzodiazepine ligands. effort in identifying endogenous
ligand(s) for mbr led to the identification of a long list
of substances, including benzodiazepine-like materials
(10), porphyrins (11), and the polypeptide diazepam
binding inhibitor (dbi) (12).
dbi was originally purified from rat brain by monitoring its ability to displace diazepam from the allosteric
modulatory sites for gab a action on 7-aminobutyric
acida (gabaa) receptors (12). subsequently, dbi was
shown to displace benzodiazepine ligands from rat adrenal mbr and to be highly expressed and stored in
adrenal cortical and testicular leydig cells, which are
also highly enriched in mbr (13-15).
microwave fixation of rat brain permitted the extraction of at least two biologically active products of dbi
processing: dbi-(33-50) [octadecaneuropeptide (odn)]
(16) and dbi-(17-50) [triakontatetraneuropeptide
(ttn)] (17). odn modulates allosterically the action of
gaba on the gabaa receptor in a manner inhibited by
flumazenil, while ttn binds preferentially to mbr (1619). the presence in the testicular leydig cells of a
peptide recognized by odn antibodies (presumably dbi)
has been recently shown by rheaume et al. (20).
a number of proteins have been identified as potential
candidates to participate in the hormone-regulated steroidgenesis (21-23), including a 8200 mol wt protein mixture isolated from bovine adrenals that stimulates pregnenolone formation in bovine adrenocortical mitochondria (24, 25). this protein mixture was further identified
to be composed of two proteins, des-(gly-ile)-dbi and
ubiquitin (26). since ubiquitin does not stimulate pregnenolone formation (26), it was infered that des-(glyile)-dbi is operative in the process of steroid biosynthesis in bovine adrenocortical cells. direct evidence that
native dbi modulates mitochondrial steroidogenesis via
an interaction with mbr is required to support this
hypothesis. in this paper we demonstrate the roles of
native rat brain dbi and synthetic dbi fragments in
adrenocortical and testicular leydig cell mitochondrial
steroid biosynthesis and the relationship of this activity
to the involvement of mbr.

supplemented with 15% horse serum plus 2.5% fetal bovine
serum (6, 8, 27). ma-10 mouse leydig tumor cells were a gift
from dr. mario ascoli (university of iowa) and were cultured
as the y-l cells, but in medium supplemented with only 15%
horse serum (7, 28). before the experiments all cells were
washed by three changes of serum-free medium during 10-min
intervals and then incubated for 2 h at 37 c in serum-free
medium containing 0.2 mm cycloheximide and either 10 nm
acth (for the adrenocortical y-l cells) or 1 nm hcg (for the
ma-10 leydig cells) (8).
isolation of mitochondria
mitochondria from y-l and ma-10 cells, subjected to the
pretreatment described above, were prepared as previously
described (8). the purity of the mitochondrial preparations
used is given in the same reference.
measurement of mitochondrial steroid biosynthesis
the effects of dbi and different synthetic peptides on mitochondrial steroid biosynthesis were determined as previously
described (7, 25, 29). in brief, y-l and ma-10 mitochondria
were resuspended at a concentration of 2.0 mg protein/900 fa
buffer a [20 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.4), 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm
mgcl2, and 30 mm kc1] containing 1 fim  xxxd3436xxx , an inhibitor
of pregnenolone metabolism (7, 8). the samples to be tested
were then added in 100 /xl buffer a. the mixture was preincubated for 5 min at 37 c, and the reaction was started by the
addition of 15 mm malate (neutralized with 1 n naoh) and 0.5
mm nadp. the incubation was then continued for 15 min at
37 c. the incubation mixture was extracted with 5 ml chloroform-methanol (2:1, vol/vol), and the organic phase was evaporated to dryness. pregnenolone was measured by a specific
ria using an antibody from radioassay systems laboratories
(carson, ca) and conditions recommended by this supplier.
dbi extraction and purification
dbi was extracted and purified from rat brain, as previously
described (12). the purity of the preparations used (>95%) was
established by sodium  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, amino acid composition, and chromatographic
characteristics on reverse phase hplc (12, 14). dbi was extracted from cultured cells and mitochondria with hot (90 c) 1
m acetic acid (14, 30).
dbi processing by y-l adrenal mitochondria
mitochondria were prepared and incubated under the conditions described above. 125i-labeled dbi (31) was added, and
the reaction was stopped by the addition of hot acetic acid
either immediately or after a 15-min incubation at 37 c. the
samples were then chromatographed on a reverse phase hplc
column (12, 14), and the fractions collected were measured for
radioactivity using a lkb 7-counter (rockville, md).

fuged at 20,000 rpm for 10 min. the extracts, with the addition
of trace amounts of 125i-labeled dbi, odn, and ttn, were
loaded onto a reverse phase /xbondapak ci8 hplc column
(waters, milford, ma) and eluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic
acid-acetonitrile gradient. fractions were collected and saved
for dbi and odn rias. the positions of odn, ttn, and dbi
were also identified by their relative retention times of 125ilabeled peptides.
dbi and odn rias
dbi-like immunoreactivity (dbi-li) of cell extracts and
mitochondrial extracts was determined as previously described
(14), using 125i-labeled dbi and a characterized rabbit antiserum (31). the sensitivity of the assay used was 1 pmol.
antibodies against synthetic odn coupled to keyhole limpet
hemocyanin were raised in rabbits. the antibodies were characterized and used as previously described (32).
peptide synthesis
the peptides were synthesized as previously described (19),
using the merrifield solid phase technique (33) with a beckman
990 automated synthesizer (palo alto, ca). peptides were purified by gel filtration on sephadex g-10, followed by reverse
phase hplc (19). the purity of the peptides synthesized was
confirmed by tlc, reverse phase hplc, and amino acid analysis (19). odn and ttn synthetic peptides were iodinated as
previously described (31).
protein determination
protein was quantified using the procedure of bradford (34)
with 7-globulin as a standard.

results
dbi and dbi processing products in y-l and ma-10
cells
in previous studies we demonstrated the validity of the
acth-responsive y-l adrenocortical and the hcg-responsive ma-10 leydig cell lines as model systems to
examine the action of ligands recognized by mbr on the
regulation of steroid biosynthesis (6-8). these two steroidogenic models were also used in the present studies.
both cell lines were found to contain significant amounts
of immunoreactive dbi-li [4.2 ± 0.54 (n = 12) and 9.5
± 0.73 (n = 12) pmol/mg protein in y-l and ma-10 cells,
respectively]. in addition, dbi processing products were
identified in y-l and ma-10 cell extracts (fig. 1) analyzed by hplc, followed by ria using an antibody raised
against odn that cross-reacts with ttn (32). in both
cell types four major peaks of odn-like immunoreactivity (odn-li) were identified. one peak emerges with a
retention time identical to that of dbi; this odn-li
peak probably is dbi and reflects the dbi cross-reactivity with the odn antibody. the peaks eluted at fractions
71 and 78 presumably represent odn and ttn, respectively, because these peaks coeluted with standard odn

the remaining peak (eluted at fraction 81) contains a
dbi peptide fragment(s) that includes epitopes reacting
with odn antiserum. however, in both cell lines the
dbi-li and odn-li content of the mitochondrial preparations used to study the effect of exogenously added
dbi was negligible (<1 nm).
effect of dbi on mitochondrial steroid biosynthesis
the next step in our studies was to determine whether
purified rat brain dbi added to mitochondria prepared
from both y-l and ma-10 cell lines could affect mitochondrial pregenenolone formation in a manner similar
to mbr ligands (7, 8). cholesterol-loaded mitochondria
were used for these studies, since they provide ideal
conditions for mbr ligand-activated intramitochondrial
cholesterol translocation and subsequent metabolism to
pregnenolone (8). dose-response curves indicated that
after 15 min of incubation with mitochondria, the apparent half-maximal stimulation was obtained with a concentration of 0.13  xxxd2136xxx  dbi, and maximal stimulation (3fold) was obtained with concentrations of 0.33-1.0  xxxd2136xxx 
dbi (fig. 2). higher dbi concentrations had lower,
although still significant (p < 0.05), stimulatory effects
on pregnenolone formation by the mitochondria prepared from both cell lines (fig. 2).

on mitochondrial pregnenolone formation. the response
was virtually linear up to 15 min, and a plateau was
reached shortly after that time.
it is well established that adrenal mitochondria contain high levels of proteolytic activity (35, 36). therefore,
the potency and efficacy of dbi in the y-l and ma-10
mitochondria could be altered by proteolytic processing
of dbi, since the experiments were performed in the
absence of protease inhibitors. to address this question,
[125i]bolton-hunter-labeled dbi was added to mitochondrial preparations in concentrations varying from 10'710"6 m. after a 15-min incubation period, the majority
(-80%) of dbi remained intact. the amount of dbi
missing could be accounted for by the formation of
several peptide fragments of dbi that were separated by
reverse phase hplc (fig. 4). two of these dbi fragments eluted from the reverse phase hplc column in
the same position as [125i]bolton-hunter-labeled odn
and ttn.

we have previously shown that flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine ligand for mbr (6, 7), antagonizes acthor lh/hcg-activated steroid biosynthesis by 30-60%
(9). figure 5a shows that flunitrazepam (10'5 m) also
inhibits dbi-stimulatedpregnenolone formation by 70%.
the inhibitory effect of flunitrazepam seems to be specific for dbi, since this benzodiazepine failed to inhibit
the increase in pregnenolone formation induced by bsa
(fig. 5b), which is much smaller than that produced by
dbi. clearly, bsa represents a nonspecific effector in
this system acting by an unknown mechanism. the fact
that flunitrazepam antagonizes the stimulation of pregnenolone formation induced by dbi, but not that by
bsa, provides substantial pharmacological support for
the view that dbi is activating steroidogenesis via mbr.
the highly selective mbr ligand pk 11195 (7, 8) increased mitochondrial steroid biosynthesis by about 75%,
but this stimulation was not additive with that of dbi
(fig. 5a). this observation further suggests that dbi
acts on mbr to mediate its effects on mitochondrial
pregnenolone synthesis.

apparent potency (ec5o, 0.33 j*m) and an efficacy close
to that of dbi. moreover, the maximal effect of ttn on
mitochondrial steroidogenesis was obtained using concentrations comparable to that of dbi (1 /hm). in contrast, odn [dbi-(33-50)] stimulated mitochondrial
pregnenolone formation with lower potency (ec50, 1 /im)
and efficacy than dbi and ttn. dbi-u-13) and dbi(17-29) synthetic peptides that contain the n-terminal
structure of dbi as well as peptide-i, a fragment of the
gabaa receptor a-subunit, and peptide-ii, an 18-amino
acid peptide, both of which contain amino acid sequences
unrelated to dbi, fail to change pregnenolone synthesis.
moreover, /s-endorphin  xxxd1891xxx  nm only marginally stimulated mitochondrial pregnenolone synthesis (12 ± 2%
increase; n = 3).
discussion
previous studies demonstrated that benzodiazepines
can stimulate mitochondrial steroidogenesis via binding
to mbr (6-8). it also has been suggested that bovine
des-(gly-ile)-dbi stimulates steroidogenesis (26). these
important observations prompted the present studies in
which we examined whether rat dbi, which displaces
ligands for mbr and is stored and expressed in steroidogenic cells (13, 14), may be an endogenous regulator
of adrenocortical and leydig cell mitochondrial pregnenolone formation via an interaction with mbr.
at first we demonstrated that both the y-l adrenocortical and ma-10 testicular leydig cells contain significant amounts of dbi-li and dbi processing products.

although these peptides have not been isolated and
sequenced from adrenal or testis, hplc analyses of yt1
adrenocortical, ma-10 leydig, as well as rat adrenal
extracts (not shown) have allowed the detection of odnand ttn-like immunoreactivities together with several
dbi fragments.
we have previously shown that cholesterol can be
mobilized by benzodiazepines that bind with high affinity
to mbr (8). the addition of rat dbi to cholesterolloaded mitochondria produces a dose-related stimulation
of pregnenolone formation, with an ec50 in the nanomolar range. moreover, the maximal stimulation induced
by dbi (~3-fold) is more robust than that obtained with
benzodiazepines (7, 8). it is important to note that the
amount of dbi-li found in the cells (5-10 pmol/mg cell
protein) corresponds to a level 2- to 4-fold greater than
that required to obtain a maximal steroidogenic response
in mitochondrial preparations.
ttn [dbi-(17-50)], a biologically active posttranslational product of dbi originally isolated and characterized from rat brain (17), displaces ro5-4864 from mbr
(17, 19). ttn stimulated pregnenolone formation by
adrenocortical mitochondria with a potency and efficacy
similar to those of dbi. however, we cannot make an
absolute assessment of the relative potency and efficacy
of these two peptides, since in preliminary studies ttn
has also been found to be processed by mitochondria at
a rate even higher than that of dbi. the possibility that
the stimulatory effect of ttn on mitochondrial steroid
biosynthesis is due to a nonspecific interaction between
the a-helical structure of the peptide (18) and mbr is
excluded because dbi-(17-29) and /3-endorphin, which

significantly stimulate pregnenolone formation. on the
other hand, odn [dbi-(33-50)], which binds to the
benzodiazepine-binding sites located on gabaa recep-

tors with an efficacy greater than that for mbr (16,17),
is less potent and less efficacious than ttn in activating
pregnenolone formation in adrenocortical mitochondria.
we have recently shown that flunitrazepam antagonizes steroid biosynthesis (9) stimulated by acth in y1 adrenal cells and by hcg in ma-10 leydig cells,
providing evidence that mbr are coupled to the physiological mechanisms regulating steroidogenesis. this
finding and the observation that flunitrazepam antagonizes the stimulatory action of purified dbi on pregnenolone formation in y-l mitochondrial preparations uphold the possibility that dbi or its active processing
products may mediate hormone-stimulated steroidogenesis via mbr. moreover, the evidence that the pk 11195induced stimulation is not additive with that of dbi
further suggests that the observed effects of dbi on
mitochondrial steroidogenesis are mediated through
mbr. however, since flunitrazepam did not completely
inhibit dbi-stimulated pregnenolone synthesis, unknown alternative mechanisms cannot be ruled out. such
a mechanism may be a direct interaction between dbi
and cytochrome p-450 side-chain cleavage, as suggested
by hall and co-workers (24, 25).
the dose-response curves of the stimulation of pregnenolone biosynthesis by dbi and ttn were biphasic.
the reason for this biphasic response is not clear. although only 20% of dbi is metabolized after its incubation with mitochondria, it is possible that some dbi
metabolites may act as partial agonists. thus, one might
speculate that the steroidogenic stimulation by dbi and
possibly ttn is regulated by their rate of degradation
at their site of action, where accumulation of the proc-

dbi and mitochondrial steroidogenesis

essing products may modulate steroidogenesis. relevant
to this finding, is the observation that adrenocortical
mitochondria exhibit high levels of protease activity (35,
36). alternatively, the biphasic curve could be explained
by an inhibitory effect of high concentrations of dbi on
cytochrome p-450 side-chain cleavage enzyme activity
or mbr desensitization. at present, there is no evidence
of mbr desensitization of hormone-induced steroidogenesis, and the interaction between dbi and the in vitro
reconstituted cytochrome p-450 side-chain cleavage enzyme system is under investigation.
it should be noted that the biphasic response obtained
using pure dbi is different from the linear response
obtained by yanagibashi et al. (25) using the 8.2-kda
protein mixture composed of des-(gly-ile)-dbi and ubiquitin (26). this discrepancy may be due to the presence
of ubiquitin or the fact that the active protein in their
system is des-gly-ile-dbi and not native dbi. the
observation that chemically synthesized ttn stimulates
mitochondrial steroidogenesis in the same manner as
dbi further supports our results obtained with purified
native dbi.
because acth and lh do not stimulate steroid production by adrenocortical and leydig cells in a biphasic
dose-response manner, this raises the possibility that
they do not merely release dbi from storage, but may
affect dbi turnover, its posttranslational processing, or
the interaction of dbi with mbr. recent data demonstrated that acute stimulation of adrenocortical (39)
(brown, a. s., and v. papadopoulos, unpublished results)
and leydig cells (brown, a. s., and v. papadopoulos,
unpublished results) with trophic hormones does not
change dbi levels; however, acth replacement in hypophysectomized rats increased dbi levels in the adrenal
within 1-2 h (39). moreover, there is evidence that
camp-dependent protein kinase may influence the level
of phosphorylation of mbr (whalin, m. e., v. papadopoulos, e. costa, and k. e. krueger, unpublished data).
these data suggest that hormones may acutely regulate
steroid biosynthesis not by a direct effect on dbi and
dbi processing products content, but by influencing the
interaction between dbi and mbr.
in conclusion, the results obtained with flunitrazepam
clearly demonstrated that the two peptides, dbi and
ttn, activate steroidogenesis via an interaction with
mbr that results in an increase in intramitochondrial
cholesterol transport and, consequently, pregnenolone
formation. because flunitrazepam is a weak agonist,
acting as an inhibitor of both hormone-stimulated steroid
biosynthesis (9) and dbi-stimulated mitochondrial pregnenolone formation, we postulate that dbi and possibly
its processing products are implicated in the regulation
of steroidogenesis in adrenocortical and testicular leydig
cells, respectively.
