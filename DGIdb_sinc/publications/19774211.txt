abstract: the therapeutic options in metastatic renal cell carcinoma have been recently
expanded by the discovery of the vhl gene, the mutation of which is associated with development
of clear cell carcinoma, and overexpression of the angiogenesis pathway, resulting in a very
vascular tumor. this breakthrough in science led to the development of a variety of small
molecules inhibiting the vegf-dependent angiogenic pathway, such as sunitinib and sorafenib.
these agents prolong overall and progression-free survival, respectively. the result was the
development of robust front-line therapies which ultimately fail and are associated with disease
progression. in this setting, there existed an unmet need for developing second-line therapies
for patients with refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mrcc).  xxxd2072xxx  ( xxxd2072xxx )
is an oral inhibitor of the mammalian  xxxg1478xxx  (mtor) pathway. the double-blind,
randomized, placebo-controlled phase iii trial of  xxxd2072xxx  (record-1) conducted in mrcc
patients after progression on sunitinib or sorafenib, or both, demonstrated a progression-free
survival benefit favoring the study drug (4.9 months vs 1.9 months, hr 0.33, 95% ci 0.25 to
0.43, p  0 0.001).  xxxd2072xxx  thus established itself as a standard of care in the second-line
setting for patients with mrcc who have failed treatment with vegf receptor inhibitors.

renal cell carcinoma (rcc) is a very aggressive malignancy originating in the renal
cortex. annual incidence in the us is approximately 54,000 and 13,000 patients die as
a result.1 more than 90% of renal tumors are rcc and 85% of rcc are clear cell type.
the majority (more than 85%) of sporadic rcc is a result of the vhl gene mutation
(locus 3p25).2 familial vhl syndrome accounts for a small number of rcc. vhl
mutation results in the activation of the angiogenesis pathway that, in turn, makes the
tumor very vascular and dependent on this pathway for survival and proliferation.2
the discovery of the vhl gene and its significance in rcc led to drug development
based on inhibition of the angiogenic pathway, which in turn led to the introduction
of various targeted therapies in this disease. prior to 2005, the standard of care for
metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mrcc) patients was immunotherapy including interferon (ifn) and interleukin.3,4 the phase ii randomized discontinuation trial (rdt) of
sorafenib, a  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor (tki), in mrcc led to establishment of sorafenib
as a viable option in rcc patients.5 the randomized phase iii double-blinded trial
(targets) of sorafenib vs placebo in the cytokine refractory setting demonstrated
a doubling of progression-free survival (pfs) favoring sorafenib (5.5 vs 2.8 months;

hazard ratio [hr] −0.44; 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.35
to 0.55; p  0 .01).6 the phase iii trial of sunitinib, another
small-molecule tki of the  xxxg2413xxx 
(vegf) and other pathways, showed robustness in prolonging
overall survival (os) (26.4 vs 21.4 months; hr −0.821; 95%
ci 0.673 to 1.001; p = 0.051) and pfs (11 vs 5.5 months;
hr −0.42; 95% ci 0.32 to 0.54; p  0.001) when compared
head to head with interferon in the first-line setting of mrcc.7
these results were clinically meaningful and demonstrated
the effect on os favoring sunitinib. calgb-90206 and the
avoren trial demonstrated the efficacy of combining
bevacizumab with ifn which produces a pfs in the range
of 8.5 to 10.2 months.8,9 a randomized phase iii trial of
 xxxd3307xxx  vs ifn vs combination of both (global arcc)
demonstrated the survival benefit in mrcc patients 10.9 vs
7.3 vs 8.4 months (hr for death 0.73; 95% ci 0.58 to 0.92;
p = 0.008).10
the above trials established the new standard of care
in mrcc which included small-molecule tkis such as
sunitinib, sorafenib, combination of bevacizumab with ifn,
and the mtor (mammalian  xxxg1478xxx  inhibitor)
inhibitor  xxxd3307xxx .6–10 these new treatments produce a
variable frequency of tumor regression, with prolongation
of pfs and os, but ultimately the tumor becomes refractory
to therapy by various mechanisms. utilization of an
alternative agent such as the mtor inhibitor  xxxd2072xxx 
in tki-refractory rcc is therefore reasonable. there is no
established molecular or biological evidence of this drug
working preferentially in tumors which are refractory to
a tki, but clearly the use of an agent with an alternative
mechanism of action was a reasonable strategy.

molecular targets and mechanism
of action of  xxxd2072xxx 
 xxxd2072xxx  is an orally available inhibitor of mtor, an
intra-cytoplasmic serine-threonine kinase which recognizes
stress response signals in cancer via the pi3k-akt
pathway.11 this signal transduction inhibition prevents the
downstream signaling involved in survival and proliferation
of tumor cells. the consequences of mtor signaling
include phosphorylation of p70 ribosomal  xxxg1989xxx  along
with the eukaryotic initiation factor 4e binding protein-1
( xxxg693xxx ). the phosphorylation of  xxxg693xxx  results in the
release of elf-4e, which in turn allows the cap-dependent
translation of proteins. the mtor kinase also has some
control over the angiogenic pathway through the hypoxiainducible factor 1 alfa (hif1alpha) and vegf and is linked to
endothelial proliferation.12,13 thus the inhibition or signal

blockade of the mtor kinase will in turn result in the cutoff
of signals from the stress response signals, prevention of
protein translation in cancer cells and also vegf-dependent
angiogenic pathway. in theory this is a multi-prong attack
against rcc.

clinical trials of  xxxd2072xxx  in rcc
 xxxd2072xxx  has been investigated in rcc as a single agent
as well as in combination with other potent molecules.

 xxxd2072xxx  monotherapy
phase i data

the phase i trial of  xxxd2072xxx  was conducted by o’donnell
et al in a variety of advanced solid tumors. this study aimed
at reaching the optimal regimen and dosage of  xxxd2072xxx .11
patients were treated in 2-part trial. the first part evaluated
the daily dose of  xxxd2072xxx  at 5, 10 and 15 mg per day along
with the toxicity, antitumor activity, pharmacokinetics and
the dose-response relationship to  xxxg1989xxx  activity in peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs). the study was complemented by blood and tumor drug levels and  xxxg1989xxx  activity
study in tumor bearing rats. part ii of the study evaluated
the weekly doses of 50 mg and 70 mg and the respective
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
a total of 92 patients were treated in the phase i trial.
eighteen patients were treated in the weekly regimen in part 1.
in part ii, 37 patients on a weekly schedule and 37 patients
on a daily schedule were treated. in part i, there was no dose
limiting toxicity (dlt) reported. the  xxxg1989xxx  activity was
suppressed 24 hours after the fourth dose in the pbmc and
the duration of suppression lengthened with higher dosage.
the daily dosing was able to demonstrate more sustained
inhibition of  xxxg1989xxx  as opposed to the weekly regimen.
in part ii, dlt occurred in 1 out of the 6 patients who
were in the 50 mg weekly group and none of the 4 patients
in the 70 mg weekly group. dlt was not observed in
4 patients who were taking 5 mg daily, but in 1 out of the
6 patients who were on 10 mg daily dosing. thus the higherdose cohorts were expanded in the weekly and daily regimen.
the common drug-related adverse events (ae) included
fatigue (34%), rash (48%) and gastrointestinal toxicities
(66%). there were 5 serious adverse events resulting in
4 hospitalizations and 3 patients required discontinuation
of the therapy. no drug-related mortality was reported by
the investigators. the elimination half-life was estimated
to be around 30 ± 8 hours, which was similar to the healthy
controls. recist evaluation demonstrated 4 partial
responses (pr) and 5 of the 10 rcc patients were progression

pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics
 xxxd2072xxx  is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of the mtor
pathway which is metabolized by the cyp3a4 system. the
pbmc-derived  xxxg1989xxx  suppression was noticed at 24 hours
in all dose levels after the 4th dose. the length of sustained
 xxxg1989xxx  suppression was longer with higher doses. the
minimum dose that would produce a minimum of 7 days
inhibition of  xxxg1989xxx  was 20 mg.11
pharmacokinetic profile was studied in 26 out of
31 patients in the weekly regimen group and 10 patients in
the daily regimen. in the weekly dose group, steady state
was achieved by the 2nd week and there was only minimal
accumulation. it was also observed that cmax increased in a
dose-dependent manner at doses 5 mg to 20 mg, but was less
dose proportional at higher doses. the elimination half-life
was 30 ± 8 hours at all dose levels.
in the daily dosing group, the steady state of the drug
was reached within a week and peak concentrations achieved
within 1 hour in all but 1 patient. the drug level in serum and
area under the curve (auc) increased in a dose-dependent
fashion. the auc was predicted by the steady state trough
levels in addition to plasma concentrations and sustained
inhibition of  xxxg1989xxx  noticed at 20 g in the weekly group
and 5 mg in the daily group. this correlated well with the
antitumor activity seen in preclinical models.

phase ii data
the above results were followed by 2 phase ii studies of
 xxxd2072xxx  in renal cell carcinoma. the first phase ii study
was conducted by jac et al in metastatic rcc patients.14
the eligibility criteria included predominant clear cell
histology, measurable disease, adequate organ function,
absence of central nervous system metastasis, zubrod
performance status (zps) of 2 or better and no more than
1 prior treatment. the therapy was  xxxd2072xxx  given  xxxd1891xxx  mg
daily dose with no interruptions on a 28-day cycle. pet-ct
was also utilized in addition to recist defined criteria
for response-evaluation which was performed at the end of
each cycle for 2 cycles. forty-one patients were enrolled
and 37 were evaluable for toxicity and response. median
age of the cohort was 60 years and 31 were male. thirty-one
patients had received prior therapy for mrcc and the zps
was 0 in 23 patients, 1 in 13 patients and 2 in 3 patients.
there were 12 pr (32%), 19 (51%) had stable disease (sd)
for 3 months and the rest progressed. median duration of

therapeutics and clinical risk management 2009:5

 xxxd2072xxx  in renal cell carcinoma

treatment was 8 months and median os was 11.5 months.
most common treatment-related toxicities included mucositis,
skin rash, pneumonitis, hypophosphatemia, hyperglycemia,
hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia. there was a
reduction in the fdg uptake in patients who had a response
or stable disease.
the second study was conducted in patients who had failed
either sunitinib or sorafenib and had not received 2 prior
regimens.15 the primary end point was response rate to
 xxxd2072xxx  utilized in the daily dosing schedule of 10 mg
orally. the eligibility criteria included presence of clear cell
carcinoma, measurable disease, adequate organ function,
absence of central nervous system metastasis and good
performance status. therapy was administered with  xxxd2072xxx 
 xxxd1891xxx  mg daily with no treatment breaks on a 28-day cycle.
recist criteria were used for evaluating the response at
the end of each 2 cycles. twenty-two patients were treated
and majority were male (67%), the median age of the cohort
was 57 years and all patients had zps 0 or 1. three patients
withdrew from the study prior to 2 cycles and were excluded
from the response evaluation. the best response was 3 pr
(16%), 14 (74%) sd that lasted for 3 months and the rest
progressed. the median pfs was 5.5 months and the os
was beyond 8 months. commonly seen treatment related
adverse events included (grade 1 to 2) hypertriglyceridemia
(73%), hyperglycemia (59%), hypercholesterolemia (64%),
stomatitis (45%), rash (32%), nausea (27%) and diarrhea
(18%). mostly seen grade 3–4 adverse event was pneumonitis
(27%). this phase ii trial demonstrated  xxxd2072xxx  as a
viable agent and its potential in the second-line setting in
rcc patients.

phase iii trial of  xxxd2072xxx  in metastatic rcc
the promising results of  xxxd2072xxx  in the tki-refractory
setting of rcc led to the double-blind randomized placebo
controlled phase iii trial of  xxxd2072xxx  in metastatic rcc
patients who progressed on vegf-targeted therapy.16
this multi-center trial was conducted at 86 centers in
australia, canada, europe, japan, and the usa. the
patients had metastatic rcc with clear cell component in
the tumor and had progressed on sunitinib or sorafenib or
both. prior treatments allowed also included interferon,
interleukin, chemotherapy, bevacizumab and radiotherapy.
more than 95% of the patients in the treatment arm and
placebo arm had undergone nephrectomy prior to enrolment in this study. the eligibility criteria included presence of measurable disease, karnofsky performance status
of 70% and adequate solid organ and marrow function.

exclusion criteria included prior exposure to mtor
inhibitors ( xxxd3307xxx ), untreated brain metastasis or
uncontrolled co-morbidities. eligible patients were randomized 2:1 to  xxxd2072xxx  vs placebo. patient stratification
was based on the memorial sloan kettering cancer center
(mskcc) prognostic scoring system and also the previous
anti-rcc therapy (one vs 2 vegf receptor  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitor).17 the treatment included continuous dosing of
oral  xxxd2072xxx   xxxd1891xxx  mg daily or placebo in addition to
best supportive care. a treatment cycle was defined as
28 days of treatment and safety evaluation was done every
2 weeks for 3 cycles and at the end of each cycle after the
third cycle.
treatment in both cohorts continued until progression,
severe toxicity, death or discontinuation. randomization was
revealed only at progression and cross-over to open-label
 xxxd2072xxx  was permissible upon progression on placebo.
blinded independent central review was utilized for recist
response evaluation.18 pfs was the primary end-point; the
time from randomization to the earliest sign of progression or
death. secondary endpoints were safety, objective response
rate (orr), os, disease-related symptoms and quality of
life (qol).
efficacy was assessed on an intent-to-treat basis
after randomization. all patients who received a dose
of  xxxd2072xxx  and followed up were assessed for safety.
qol was assessed utilizing the european organization for
research and treatment of cancer (eortc) qlq-c30
and functional assessment of cancer therapy kidney
symptom index-disease-related symptoms (fksi-drs)
questionnaires.19,20
the sample size was calculated based on the prolongation
of pfs by 50% from 3 months to 4.5 months and a
risk-reduction of 33% (corresponding to a hr of 0.67). the
3-month pfs for placebo was assessed based on data from
the target trial where the placebo treated arm had a pfs
of 2.8 months after failing prior cytokine based therapy.6 one
sided cumulative alpha of 0.025 in the 2:1 random allocation
calculated the need for 290 events so as to achieve a power
of 90% in this study. interim analyses were planned at 30%
and 60% of the total (290) events and the final analysis at
290 events. the interim analysis allowed the study to be
discontinued for reasons of safety, futility, or lack of efficacy.
lan demets and o’brien-fleming spending functions were
utilized with pre-defined stopping boundaries. the patients
who did not progress or die at the time of data cutoff were
censored. kaplan-meier method was used for pfs and
os estimation.

after screening 554 patients, 410 were randomly
assigned in a 2:1 ratio to  xxxd2072xxx  or placebo. there were
272 patients in the  xxxd2072xxx  arm and 138 in the placebo
arm. the median age in  xxxd2072xxx  arm was 61 and 60 in the
placebo arm. nearly 71% in the  xxxd2072xxx  group and 79%
in the placebo group had progressed during prior therapy and
the median length of treatment was 95 days in  xxxd2072xxx  and
57 days in placebo respectively. majority (96% in  xxxd2072xxx 
and 95% in placebo) had undergone prior nephrectomy.
nearly two-third of patients in each arm had 3 sites of
disease. the reasons for discontinuation of treatment included
death, progressive disease, adverse events and withdrawal of
consent by the patient. at the time of data cutoff, the pfs
in  xxxd2072xxx  assessed by the independent central reviewers
was significantly longer than placebo arm (hr = 0.33; 95%
ci 0.25 to 0.43; p  0.001). the best responses observed in
the two arms were 1% vs 0% pr, 63% vs 32% sd, 19% vs
46% pd favoring  xxxd2072xxx . in 17% patients on  xxxd2072xxx 
and 22% patients on placebo, disease could not be assessed.
median pfs was 4.9 (4 to 5.5 months) months vs 1.9 months
(1.8 to 1.9 months) favoring  xxxd2072xxx . at 6 months,
progression-free probability was 26% in patients receiving
 xxxd2072xxx  and 2% in patients receiving placebo.
pre-defined exploratory and subset analyses demonstrated
benefit from  xxxd2072xxx  in all groups based on age, sex,
prior vegf-targeted therapy and geographical region. the
median os has not been reached at the time of the data
cutoff (table 1). the overall survival data from this trial is
still being awaited.
no observable difference was evident between the two
groups with respect to the time to clear-cut deterioration of
patient-reported outcomes. the evaluation of the fksi-drs
risk score and the eortc qlq-c30 score indicated that
the qol was sustained in the  xxxd2072xxx  group compared
to placebo. the above scoring system compared various
factors including physical functioning, global health status/
quality of life, role functioning, emotional functioning,
cognitive functioning, social functioning and symptoms.
the above observation favoring the  xxxd2072xxx  group was
irrespective of the increased adverse events seen in the
active treatment arm.
adverse events were more frequent in  xxxd2072xxx 
compared to placebo and the most commonly reported
ae in the study drug arm included stomatitis (44%),
rash (29%), fatigue (31%), asthenia (33%), anemia
(92%), hypercholesterolemia (77%), hypertriglyceridemia
(73%) and hyperglycemia (57%).21 the most commonly
seen grade 3 aes in the  xxxd2072xxx  arm included stomatitis

radiographic lung change irrespective of signs or symptoms
(pleural effusion, hypoxia, cough, dyspnea, malaise), in the
absence of a non-drug cause. further studies on this adverse
event are under way.16
the objective response rate was 1% in the  xxxd2072xxx 
arm and none in the placebo arm. even though  xxxd2072xxx 
was not associated with impressive objective responses, the
prolongation of pfs demonstrated by this drug was definitely a
correlation with the increased number of sd observed (table 3).
this is an interesting phenomenon, where recist-defined
tumor shrinkage is not necessary for pfs advantage. this is
an indirect indication of why recist-defined tumor evaluation is probably not the best way to assess the response to the
signal transduction inhibitors, including  xxxd2072xxx .

 xxxd2072xxx  combinations in rcc
the combination of  xxxd2072xxx  with another agent is a viable
option if the second agent targets the signaling in a different
pathway. this phase ii study by whorf et al utilized the
combination of bevacizumab with  xxxd2072xxx  and enrolled
patients with advanced rcc into two groups.22 bevacizumab
was dosed  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg iv every 2 weeks and  xxxd2072xxx  was
used  xxxd1891xxx  mg orally daily until progression. patients with
advanced clear cell rcc or metastatic or recurrent rcc,
with ecog performance status of 1 or better were enrolled
in this study. there were two groups of patients based on
prior treatment: a, no prior treatment or b, prior sunitinib or
sorafenib. treatment evaluation was done using the recist
criteria at the end of every 8 weeks.18
fifty-nine patients (30 to group a and 29 to group b)
were enrolled. the median age was 65 years with 76%
having intermediate motzer prognostic score and 73% with
prior nephrectomy. there were 42 patients who received
therapy for at least 8 weeks, 6 patients were non-evaluable
and 11 were not at the 8-week mark. the best response in the
evaluable patients (n = 48) was 21% orr and 69% sd/minor
response. toxicities included proteinuria (19% grade 3–4),
fatigue (9% grade 3–4) mucositis/stomatitis (49% grade 3–4),
hyperlipidemia (45% grade 3–4), nausea (40% grade 3–4) and
hypertension (25%). the final results of this study are pending.
the interim results are suggestive of the feasibility and relative
safety of the combination of  xxxd2072xxx  and bevacizumab.
report of a phase i trial combining sunitinib and
 xxxd2072xxx  was reported at the 2009 asco annual meeting.23
cohorts of patients were enrolled to receive sunitinib at
37.5 mg in the 4 weeks on/2 weeks off schedule along with
 xxxd2072xxx  in a daily or weekly regimen.23 the combination
produced dlt in cohort 4 (sunitinib at 37.5 mg and  xxxd2072xxx

at 30 mg weekly). the severe adverse events included
endocarditis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage with severe anemia
and pulmonary embolism. the recommended dose for phase ii
trial of this combination is sunitinib at 37.5 mg in a 4 weeks
on 2 weeks off fashion with  xxxd2072xxx  at 20 mg weekly.23

ongoing clinical trials of  xxxd2072xxx 
after the efficacy and pfs benefit from  xxxd2072xxx  in rcc
was established by the record-1 trial, a series of phase i
and ii clinical trials have been started for evaluating the benefit
of combining  xxxd2072xxx  with various other active agents
(table 4). there are trials evaluating the efficacy of  xxxd2072xxx 
in non-clear cell carcinoma and also papillary histology.

conclusion
 xxxd2072xxx  is a potent orally available mtor inhibitor, which has shown to be beneficial in the second-line

setting of metastatic rcc.  xxxd2072xxx  was associated with
several adverse events, both metabolic and systemic, but
was tolerated reasonably well by the majority of patients.
 xxxd2072xxx  produces few recist type responses, however,
tumor shrinkage analysis demonstrates over 70% of patients
had some degree of shrinkage, and that mostly stable disease
is produced in this population of refractory patients. the high
rate of sd translated into a pfs advantage which is double
that of placebo. this phenomenon may also be partially
due to the fact that the patients had received more than one
line of therapy (tki, cytokines and other therapies) prior
to trial enrolment and, tumors were refractory to different
lines of therapy. this is similar to the phenomenon seen
with sorafenib in the targets trial, where patients were
treated in the second line, and the response rate to sorafenib
was 10%, but there was pfs and survival advantage.
the patients who had prior sunitinib (n = 124) had better
pfs compared to the placebo (n = 60) (3.88 months vs
1.84 months; hr 0.34; 95% ci 0.23 to 0.51; p  0.001).
similarly the patients who had prior sorafenib (n = 81)
also did much better than placebo (n = 43) (5.88 months vs
2.83 months; hr 0.25; 95% ci 0.16 to 0.42; p  0.001). the
above established  xxxd2072xxx  as a choice for treating patients
with rcc after they fail sunitinib or sorafenib.24
the phase iii trial of  xxxd2072xxx  was conducted after the
approval of sorafenib, sunitinib and also  xxxd3307xxx  for
patients with rcc. in this scenario the trial was performed
in the tki refractory setting, which represented an unmet
clinical need. the fda approved  xxxd2072xxx  in metastatic

rcc patients who are refractory to sunitinib or sorafenib.
the increased number of sd and pfs advantage seen in
the  xxxd2072xxx  arm proved that recist-defined tumor
shrinkage is probably not necessary for pfs benefit. it is also
demonstrating an unmet need for functional imaging studies
in rcc patients treated with signal transduction inhibitors
like  xxxd2072xxx , and thus changing the standard of evaluation
from the traditional recist evaluation to a more meaningful evaluation that would correlate with the activity of the
tumors. per the recist evaluation this could be further
characterized as high disease stabilization effect, as in the
case of sorafenib. the changes observed in the fdg pet ct
after cycle 2 (phase ii trial) in patients who had a pr or sd
could mean that it is more of a meaningful way of evaluating
response to drugs that block signaling. this could also mean
that the recist defined sd may indeed be contributing
to the potential progression-free survival benefit from this
agent. but the above needs to be validated by larger studies.
the revised recist (ver 1.1) also allows the judicious use
of fdg pet-ct to complement ct findings.25
the adverse events were more frequent in the  xxxd2072xxx 
arm compared to the placebo group. the adverse events were
unique in the sense that there were metabolic adverse events
like hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, hypophosphatemia etc in
addition to the class-specific non-infectious pneumonitis.
in addition, the qol of advanced rcc patients treated
with  xxxd2072xxx  was maintained, independent of the adverse
events produced by  xxxd2072xxx . this means that  xxxd2072xxx 
may be a good choice in patients with advanced disease where
the goals could be re-set to improvement in the quality of life
and disease stabilization with pfs benefit rather than tumor
shrinkage. this drug is in the same class as  xxxd3307xxx , but
its advantage is that it is orally dosed opposed to the weekly
iv dosing of  xxxd3307xxx , which could be cumbersome. for
the above reasons,  xxxd2072xxx  was approved in advanced
rcc patients, who failed prior tki-based therapy.
 xxxd2072xxx  is an orally bioavailable agent, whereas
 xxxd3307xxx  is an intravenous prodrug. both agents are
mtor inhibitors, differences relate to their pharmacodynamic
and pharmacokinetic properties. the differences in their
indications in rcc relate to study design and patient
populations in which the respective trials were conducted.
there should also be front-line trials of  xxxd2072xxx  in
advanced rcc as it has proven to be an effective second-line
agent. this drug might bring forth more responses, if tried
in the front-line setting. the activity of  xxxd2072xxx  in
the front-line setting may be much better than in the
tki-1 setting, due to the difference in biology of the disease

 xxxd2072xxx  in renal cell carcinoma

between treatment-naive and tki-refractory settings. the
various combination trials of  xxxd2072xxx  with agents which
work in pathways other than mtor signaling would be worth
waiting for. phase iv studies of  xxxd2072xxx  for assessing the
safety in large populations are underway.
