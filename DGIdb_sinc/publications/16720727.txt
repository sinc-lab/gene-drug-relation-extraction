abstract
the recently cloned lamprey  xxxg931xxx  was shown to have several unique features, including the longest
intracellular c-terminal tail (120 amino acids (aa)) of any previously described  xxxg931xxx . in the current study, a
series of experiments were performed examining camp responses, binding kinetics, whole cell competitive binding
assays and internalization studies of the lamprey  xxxg931xxx  using a series of three c-terminal tail truncations
(80 aa, 40 aa and 0 aa) to better describe the functional significance of this unique vertebrate  xxxg931xxx .
activation of the lamprey  xxxg931xxx  was shown to stimulate camp production in a dose-dependant manner when
treated with either lamprey  xxxd2226xxx  (logec50 −6·57±0·15) or lamprey gnrh-iii (logec50 −8·29±0·09). truncation
analysis indicated that the membrane proximal 40 aa of the lamprey  xxxg931xxx  c-terminal tail contain a motif
required for camp accumulation. saturation binding assays using the wild type and truncated lamprey gnrh receptors
revealed that all of three truncated lamprey gnrh receptors were capable of binding lamprey  xxxd2226xxx . competitive,
intact cell-binding assays suggested that the lamprey  xxxg931xxx  is lamprey gnrh-iii selective, based on
the observed pharmacological profile: lamprey gnrh-iii (inhibitory constant (ki) 0·708±0·245 nm)=chicken gnrh-ii
(ki 0·765±0·160 nm). xxxd2226xxx  (ki 12·9±1·96 nm).dala6pro9net  xxxd2226xxx  (ki 21·6±9·68 nm).
lamprey  xxxd2226xxx  (ki 118·0±23·6). finally, the lamprey  xxxg931xxx  was shown to undergo rapid ligand-dependant
internalization, which was significantly diminished in the tail-less truncated form. we have shown from our current and
our previous structural studies that this unique lamprey  xxxg931xxx  shares several characteristics of both type i
and type ii gnrh receptors which suggests that this receptor has retained ancestral characteristics that can provide
insight into the function and evolution of the vertebrate  xxxg931xxx  family.

introduction
the vertebrate hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis is
regulated by  xxxg930xxx  (gnrh),
a decapeptide hormone that is produced and released
from the hypothalamus. at the anterior pituitary, gnrh
action is mediated through high aﬃnity binding with the
 xxxg931xxx , a class a or rhodopsin-like seven
transmembrane  xxxg89xxx  (gpcr)
(millar et al. 2004). the  xxxg931xxx  is unique
among all gpcrs in that the type i  xxxd2226xxx 
receptors lack the highly conserved intracellular
carboxy-terminal (c-terminal) tail, which has been
shown to be a vital structural element required for
several key functions, such as g-protein coupling and
second messenger activation, ligand binding, cell surface
expression and ligand-dependant internalization (koenig
& edwardson 1997, heding et al. 1998, blomenrohr et al.
1999, bockaert et al. 2003, ronacher et al. 2004). based
simply on the presence or absence of a c-terminal tail,

the gnrh receptors can be divided into two groups; the
type i tail-less gnrh receptors, which have only been
identified in mammals and the c-terminal tailcontaining type ii gnrh receptors, which have been
identified across the vertebrate lineage (okubo et al.
2001, ikemoto et al. 2004, silver et al. 2005).
 xxxg931xxx  signaling has been characterized in
several systems, and is primarily thought to function
through the inositol 1,4,5- xxxd3444xxx  (ip3) second
messenger pathway; however, type ii gnrh receptors
and in some cases type i gnrh receptors have been
shown to also activate camp signaling (arora et al. 1998,
stanislaus et al. 1998, grosse et al. 2000, liu et al. 2002,
oh et al. 2005). the presence or absence of the
c-terminal tail in type ii and type i gnrh receptors
respectively could possibly explain the signaling disparity
between the two groups, where, for example, histidine–
phenylalanine–arginine–lysine (an hfrk) motif in the
membrane proximal region of bullfrog type ii gnrh
receptors was recently shown to be required for camp

signaling (oh et al. 2005). rapid, ligand-dependant
internalization resulting in desensitization and/or signal
switching is another key functional diﬀerence between
type i and type ii gnrh receptors; this has been
described and attributed to the presence or absence of
specific ser/thr residues located throughout the
c-terminal tail (blomenrohr et al. 1999, willars et al.
1999, pawson et al. 2003, ronacher et al. 2004).
as an agnathan, the oldest extant lineage of
vertebrates, the sea lamprey has become a model system
for analysis of the evolution of the neuroendocrine
regulation of reproduction (sower 2003). the lamprey
expresses two forms of gnrh, lamprey  xxxd2226xxx  and
lamprey gnrh-iii, both of which are produced in the
hypothalamus and have been shown to regulate the
reproductive axis (sherwood et al. 1986, sower et al.
1993, deragon & sower 1994, suzuki et al. 2000, silver
et al. 2004). recently, a  xxxg931xxx  cdna was
cloned from the sea lamprey, petromyzon marinus; this
contained a c-terminal tail of 120 amino acids (aa), the
longest of any previously described  xxxg931xxx  to
date (silver et al. 2005). to better describe the lamprey
 xxxg931xxx , a series of functional and pharmacological assays was performed in the current study,
including examination of camp responses, analysis of
receptor binding kinetics, whole cell competitive binding
assays and internalization studies using a series of
c-terminal tail truncations to better our understanding
of the significance of certain regions of the lengthy
c-terminal tail, as well as functional aspects of the
receptor. the lamprey  xxxg931xxx  was shown to
stimulate the camp signaling system in a dosedependant manner, which, through mutagenesis studies,
was shown to depend on the presence of the c-terminal
tail. the c-terminal tail was also shown to be required
for rapid ligand-dependant internalization, binding
aﬃnity and, to some degree, cell surface expression.
finally, pharmacological profiling, in conjunction with
these and previous eﬃcacy data has confirmed that
the lamprey  xxxg931xxx  is lamprey gnrh-iii
selective. these data indicate that the lamprey gnrh
receptor shares several characteristics of both type i
and type ii gnrh receptors and likely retains
ancestral characteristics of the vertebrate gnrh
receptor family.

described (hazum et al. 1983, pawson et al. 1998, king

type lamprey  xxxg931xxx  or c-terminal tail truncated mutants were seeded (1105 cells) in 24-well plates
in 500 µl medium, and were grown for 48 h. cells were
incubated with 10 nm 125i-labeled lamprey  xxxd2226xxx  on
ice at 4 c for 3·5 h. cells were then immediately brought
to 37 c for increasing periods of time. at the end of each
time-point, cells were placed on ice and washed twice
with 500 µl ice-cold pbs. acid-sensitive (surface bound)
125
i-labeled lamprey gnrh was washed away by the
addition of 0·3 ml acid solution (150 mm nacl, 50 mm
acetic acid, ph 2·8) for 12 min. the acid wash was
removed, and acid insensitive (internalized) ligand was
recovered using solubilizing reagent (0·5 m naoh with
0·1% sds). both acid-sensitive and -insensitive binding
was quantified with a -counter, and percent internalization was determined based on comparison of internalized
ligand to total cell-associated ligand (internalized+surface
bound). nsbs were determined using non-transfected
cells. treatments were performed in triplicate, and
independent experiments were run three times for each
receptor construct. data were analyzed using prism

significantly (p<0·0001) lower then the logec50 of
lamprey  xxxd2226xxx  (6·590·082). this approximately
50-fold diﬀerence suggests that the presently cloned

transfected with blank pcdna3·1 vector did not respond
to treatment with either lamprey  xxxd2226xxx  or lamprey
gnrh-iii (data not shown).
consistent with this diﬀerence in logec50, lamprey
gnrh-iii stimulated a larger magnitude of camp
accumulation, compared with lamprey  xxxd2226xxx , when
the wild type or mutant lamprey gnrh receptors were
treated with a maximum dose (10 5 m) (fig. 3 or table

led to a 1·680·073-fold increase in response to
lamprey  xxxd2226xxx  and a 2·110·162-fold increase in
response to lamprey gnrh-iii. serial truncation of the
lamprey  xxxg931xxx  led to a drastic decrease in
the magnitude of camp accumulation, whereas the
stimulation of the 80 aa c-terminal tail resulted in
1·260·204- and 1·360·117-fold increases in response to lamprey  xxxd2226xxx  and lamprey gnrh-iii
respectively. further truncation of the c-terminal tail to

(1·770·242-fold for lamprey  xxxd2226xxx  and 2·19

the tail-less mutant showed a drastic reduction in ability
to activate the camp system (1·260·056-fold increase
in response to lamprey  xxxd2226xxx  and 1·300·059-fold
increase in response to lamprey gnrh-iii).

response to treatment with 10 nm 125i-labeled lamprey

in the intracellular fraction. lamprey  xxxg931xxx 
mutants with c-terminal tail truncations were used to
identify regions containing motifs that are required for
rapid ligand-dependant internalization. truncation of
the c-terminal tail to 80 aa or 40 aa had no eﬀect on
either the rate or extent of internalization when
compared with wild type. the tail-less lamprey gnrh
receptor, however, showed a marked reduction in
ligand-dependent internalization, with a ymax of 28·9%,
a drastic reduction compared with the wild type or other
truncated mutants.

discussion
the  xxxg931xxx  from the sea lamprey, petromyzon
marinus, a member of the oldest extant lineage of
vertebrates, the agnathans, was used in a series of
functional and pharmacological experiments in order to
investigate and better define how the function of the
 xxxg931xxx  family has evolved across vertebrates.
stimulation of the lamprey  xxxg931xxx  was shown
to activate camp production; however, this activation
was shown to require the first 40 aa of the c-terminal
tail. since the truncated tail-less mutant lamprey gnrh
receptor was capable of ligand binding we propose that
gs coupling requires a motif within the first 40 aa of
the c-terminal tail. pharmacological profiling indicated
that the lamprey  xxxg931xxx  is lamprey gnrh-iii
selective, with an equal aﬃnity for lamprey gnrh-iii
and chicken gnrh-ii. the wild type, 80 aa c-terminal
tail mutant and 40 aa c-terminal tail mutant lamprey
gnrh receptors were shown to undergo rapid,
ligand-dependant internalization, but the tail-less mutant
was not, indicating a motif within the first 40 aa that is
required for this process. this unique lamprey gnrh
receptor has high aﬃnity for both lamprey gnrh-iii

and chicken gnrh-ii and ligand-binding activity when
truncated to a tail-less form.
unique among the approximately 1000 gpcr
encoding genes in the human genome (fredriksson et al.
2003), the type i  xxxg931xxx  lacks an intracellular
c-terminal tail, which is thought to be involved in
g-protein coupling, cell surface expression and internalization (blomenrohr et al. 1999, vrecl et al. 2000,
ronacher et al. 2004). interestingly, tail-less or type i
gnrh receptors have only been identified in mammals,
while type ii gnrh receptors, which contain
c-terminal tails, have been cloned from species across
the vertebrate lineage, suggesting a recent, rapid
evolutionary history (sealfon et al. 1997, millar et al.
2004). a comparative analysis of gnrh receptors across
the vertebrate lineage can provide significant insight into
the molecular evolution of this receptor family. in this
light, the  xxxg931xxx  from the sea lamprey,
petromyzon marinus (silver et al. 2005), provides an ideal
model to analyze basal, or ancestral-like functions and
functional elements that are involved in ligand binding,
signaling and internalization.
pituitary gnrh receptors are thought to primarily
signal through gq/11, resulting in the stimulation of the
ip3 second messenger system; however, gs activation
and camp signaling has been reported as well (arora
et al. 1998, stanislaus et al. 1998, grosse et al. 2000, liu
et al. 2002, oh et al. 2005). g-protein coupling to type i
gnrh receptors clearly occurs within the intracellular
loops (ils), where several motifs have been identified
that may be involved in g-protein coupling (see table
3). for instance, the drxxxi/vxxpl motif in  xxxg1173xxx  and a
conserved ala residue in  xxxg1177xxx  have been linked to gq/11

coupling (arora et al. 1995, myburgh et al. 1998), while a
bbxxb (where b is any basic amino acid) in  xxxg1169xxx  was
shown to be required for gs coupling (arora et al.
1998). furthermore, the presence or absence of the
c-terminal tail in the type ii or type i gnrh receptors
could possibly explain the signaling disparity between
the two groups, whereas an hfrk motif in the
membrane proximal region of the bullfrog type ii
 xxxg931xxx -1 was recently shown to be required for
camp signaling, but not for inositol phosphate (ip)
signaling (oh et al. 2005). in the present study, lamprey
 xxxg931xxx  was shown to activate the camp
signaling system, in a dose-dependent manner, in
transiently transfected cos7 cells. lamprey gnrh-iii
was a more potent activator of this system compared
with lamprey  xxxd2226xxx , which supports the previous
hypothesis, based on ip activation (silver et al. 2005),
that the lamprey  xxxg931xxx  is lamprey gnrh-iii
selective. these data have several interesting implications. the lamprey  xxxg931xxx  activates both the
camp and ip signaling systems; however, the ip system
is activated at an approximately 10-fold lower
concentration of both lamprey  xxxd2226xxx  and lamprey
gnrh-iii, and is also activated to a greater magnitude
of approximately 4·5-fold, compared with 1·7-fold
(lamprey  xxxd2226xxx ) or 2·1-fold (lamprey gnrh-iii)
(see fig. 3) accumulation of camp. not unexpectedly,
truncation of the lamprey  xxxg931xxx  c-terminal
tail interfered with camp signaling; this is partially
recovered by the 40 aa tail mutant, and lost again in the
tail-less mutant form. the exact nature of gpcr/gprotein coupling is still in question since no conserved
motifs that can be generally used to define g-protein
specificity have been identified, nor has any particular
domain been shown to be required. these current
data indicate that a motif within the first 40 aa of the
lamprey  xxxg931xxx  is involved in the gs coupling,
which we propose to be the ‘hfrk’-like motif
www.endocrinology-journals.org

(histidine–valine–arginine–arginine (hvrr) in lamprey)
located within the membrane proximal region of the
c-terminal tail. furthermore, this region contains a
bbxxb (b is any basic amino acid), which has been
shown to be involved in gs coupling in type i gnrh
receptors, in which case this motif is located in the first
il (arora et al. 1998).
the pharmacological profile of the lamprey gnrh
receptor, as shown in fig. 5 and table 2, confirms the
hypothesis that the lamprey  xxxg931xxx  is lamprey
gnrh-iii selective, and furthermore supports the
hypothesis that the lamprey expresses at least one
additional, lamprey  xxxd2226xxx  selective receptor, as
previously described based on quantitative in vitro
autoradiography (knox et al. 1994) and ip signaling
eﬃcacy (silver et al. 2005). the equivalent aﬃnity for
lamprey gnrh-iii and chicken gnrh-ii for this
ancestral vertebrate  xxxg931xxx  implies that
perhaps they represent ancestral forms of gnrh, as
previously suggested (sherwood et al. 1997, sower 1997);
nonetheless, more data would be required to confirm
this hypothesis.
eﬃcacy data on their own can be diﬃcult to interpret
and misleading; however, in conjunction with binding
aﬃnity studies they can provide invaluable insight into
the molecular mechanisms of gpcr function. the
eﬀects of lamprey  xxxg931xxx  c-terminal tail
truncations on binding aﬃnity and cell surface
expression showed that perturbation of the c-terminal
tail increases kd (reduces binding aﬃnity) and increases
the level of cell surface expression. however, there is one
exception, in which the level of cell surface expression
decreased in the truncated 80 aa c-terminal tail
receptor. these data may explain the drastic decrease in
signaling of the truncated 80 aa c-terminal tail receptor,
which likely results from a combination of decreased
binding aﬃnity and cell surface expression. alternatively, the recovery of camp accumulation that was seen

lamprey  xxxg931xxx  characterization

when the lamprey  xxxg931xxx  with a 40 aa tail was
activated may be due to the increase in cell surface
expression, which compensates for the reduction in
binding aﬃnity. finally, the fully truncated tail-less
receptor was shown to maintain ligand-binding capability at a diminished binding aﬃnity, which, despite an
increase in surface expression, led to the accumulation of
near basal levels of camp. because the tail-less lamprey
 xxxg931xxx  mutant is known to be active in
stimulating ip3 at an equivalent magnitude compared
with wild type (silver et al. 2005), these data support the
hypothesis that gs coupling occurs within the first 40
aa of the c-terminal tail.
rapid, ligand-dependant gpcr internalization is a
well-established regulatory mechanism that results in
receptor desensitization or alternatively facilitates signal
switching from g-protein-mediated second messaging to
map kinase signaling (mcardle et al. 2002). activation
of type ii gnrh receptors has been extensively shown
to lead to rapid internalization that can be -arrestin
dependent or independent, dynamin dependent or
independent and through either clathrin coated vesicles
or caveolae (acharjee et al. 2002, pawson et al. 2003,
ronacher et al. 2004, hislop et al. 2005). type i gnrh
receptors have been shown to be internalized but at a
significantly slower rate and to a lesser extent when
compared with type ii gnrh receptors (pawson et al.
1998, willars et al. 1999, hislop et al. 2005). addition of
the c-terminal tail from the type ii catfish gnrh
receptor to the rat  xxxg931xxx  was shown to result
in several functional aberrations, most notably induction
of rapid ligand-dependant internalization, which was
shown to be reversible through c-terminal tail
truncations (lin et al. 1998). furthermore, removal of the
c-terminal tail from the type ii chicken  xxxg931xxx 
was shown to result in an internalization profile similar
to the naturally tail-less human type i  xxxg931xxx 
(pawson et al. 1998). these studies provided the impetus
to further define the motifs involved in this rapid
internalization, leading to a series of studies indicating
specific ser/thr moieties located in both the membrane
proximal or distal regions of the c-terminal tail
(blomenrohr et al. 1999, pawson et al. 2003, millar et al.
2004, ronacher et al. 2004). the 120 aa c-terminal tail
of the lamprey  xxxg931xxx , the longest of any
known  xxxg931xxx  (silver et al. 2005), contains
several ser/thr residues located throughout the entire
sequence; however, they are concentrated within the
first 40 aa. the lamprey  xxxg931xxx  was shown to
be rapidly internalized in response to stimulation,
whereas approximately 60% of the ligand-bound
receptors were located in the intracellular space.
truncation of the c-terminal tail to 80 aa or 40 aa had
no eﬀect on internalization (rate or maximum level) but
the tail-less mutant showed a drastic reduction in
internalization, similar to other previously described
journal of molecular endocrinology (2006) 36, 601–610

tail-less receptor internalization profiles (heding et al.
1998, pawson et al. 1998). it should be noted that these
internalization profiles were generated using lamprey
 xxxd2226xxx  because of the inability to iodinate lamprey
gnrh-iii, which lacks a tyrosine residue. the use of
lamprey  xxxd2226xxx  in these experiments may lead to
diﬀerent results compared with lamprey gnrh-iii
stimulation of the lamprey  xxxg931xxx ; however,
these diﬀerences would likely be reflected in the
magnitude of responses and not novel response profiles.
in summary, the lamprey  xxxg931xxx  was shown
to activate the camp signaling system, which required
the first 40 aa of the c-terminal tail. pharmacological
profiling, in conjunction with eﬃcacy data, provided
evidence that the lamprey  xxxg931xxx  is lamprey
gnrh-iii selective, which supports the hypothesis that
the lamprey expresses a second, lamprey  xxxd2226xxx 
selective receptor. truncations of the lamprey gnrh
receptor’s c-terminal tail were shown to reduce binding
aﬃnity, which explains their reductions in signaling
capacity. finally, the lamprey  xxxg931xxx  underwent rapid ligand-dependant internalization, which was
drastically reduced in the tail-less mutant form,
suggesting that putative phosphoacceptor sites located
within the first 40 aa of the c-terminal tail are required
for this regulatory mechanism. since the 40 aa
c-terminal tail lamprey  xxxg931xxx  mutant is
capable of stimulating both ip3 (silver et al. 2005) and
camp accumulation and undergoes rapid liganddependant internalization, given the results of these
studies we propose that the extensive length of the
lamprey  xxxg931xxx  c-terminal tail may not have a
functional significance with these signaling systems.
however, the intact lengthy lamprey  xxxg931xxx 
c-terminal tail likely reflects an ancestral characteristic
and may be required for structural stability, eﬃcient
ligand binding and/or stimulation of another unknown
signaling pathway. further detailed mutagenic studies
need to be done to determine the function of the
c-terminal tail of the lamprey  xxxg931xxx . in
conclusion, the data from the current and previous
studies indicate that the lamprey  xxxg931xxx  shares
several characteristics of both type i and type ii gnrh
receptors, suggesting that it retains ancestral characteristics of the vertebrate  xxxg931xxx  family.
