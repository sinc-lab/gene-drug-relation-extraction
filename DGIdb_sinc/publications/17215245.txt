both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have multiple mechanisms for preventing and counteracting the effects of oxidative
stress (1). reactive oxygen species (ros)3 are normal products
of aerobic metabolism, but excess ros accumulation due to
perturbation of control mechanisms can result in accumulation

of mutations, premature aging, and cell death (2– 4). many of
the central mechanisms for controlling redox balance in the cell
are highly conserved. these mechanisms include 1) proteins
involved directly in regulating redox balance or repairing
effects of oxidative stress, including the well known components of the glutathione- and thioredoxin-dependent reduction
systems, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and the pentose phosphate pathway, and 2) a transcriptional response centered
around recruitment of the “redox-specific” transcription factors to promoters of these and other antioxidant response genes
(2, 3).
only recently has the full spectrum of genes important for
control of oxidative stress begun to be appreciated, through
microarray analysis of responses to a variety of oxidants and
screens of ordered s. cerevisiae deletion mutant arrays (5–7).
genomic screens have revealed that deletions in many genes
not previously associated with redox balance result in sensitivity to one or more applied oxidants (6 – 8). these screens also
revealed that response to oxidative stress may be more specific
than previously appreciated, since many deletion mutants show
sensitivity to one type of oxidant but little sensitivity to others
(7, 8). these results suggest that the cell tailors its response to
different stresses rather than having a single general response
pathway (9). however, certain deletion strains do show sensitivity to multiple different applied oxidants (7, 8). this may
indicate that the deletions in these genes affect protective
mechanisms that are used in multiple contexts and/or that the
deletions result in a chronic state of oxidative stress that render
the mutants unable to cope with further stress. consistent with
this, mutants lacking important antioxidant functions also
show evidence of oxidative stress or damage even in the absence
of an applied oxidative stress (10, 11). in these cases, the screens
may be revealing previously unappreciated sources of oxidative
stress and the cellular mechanisms that contain them.
yeast mutants lacking subunits of the vacuolar proton-translocating atpase (v-atpase) have been identified in multiple
genomic screens for sensitivity to different forms of oxidative
stress (6 – 8). the v-atpase is a highly conserved  xxxg215xxx 
responsible for acidification of organelles such as the lysosome/
vacuole, golgi apparatus, and endosomes in all eukaryotic cells
(12, 13). v-atpases have also been recruited to a variety of
more specialized functions, often involving high level expression of the enzyme at the plasma membrane of polarized cells,
in addition to intracellular compartments (13, 14). the yeast s.
cerevisiae does not appear to express a plasma membrane form
of the v-atpase and has proven to be an excellent model for
the “constitutive” functions of v-atpases associated with acidjournal of biological chemistry

yeast mutants lacking vacuolar proton-translocating atpase
(v-atpase) subunits (vma mutants) were sensitive to several
different oxidants in a recent genomic screen (thorpe, g. w.,
fong, c. s., alic, n., higgins, v. j., and dawes, i. w. (2004)  xxxg1847xxx .
natl. acad. sci. u. s. a. 101, 6564 – 6569). we confirmed that
mutants lacking a v1 subunit ( xxxg221xxx ⌬), vo subunit, or either of
the two vo  xxxg220xxx  isoforms are acutely sensitive to h2o2 and
more sensitive to  xxxd2563xxx  and diamide than wild-type cells.
the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant contains elevated levels of reactive oxygen
species and high levels of oxidative protein damage even in the
absence of an applied oxidant, suggesting an endogenous source
of oxidative stress.  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutants lacking mitochondrial dna
showed neither improved growth nor decreased sensitivity to
peroxide, excluding respiration as the major source of the
endogenous reactive oxygen species in the mutant. double
mutants lacking both  xxxg221xxx  and components of the major cytosolic defense systems exhibited synthetic sensitivity to h2o2.
microarray analysis comparing wild-type and  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant
cells grown at ph 5, permissive conditions for the  xxxg221xxx ⌬
mutant, indicated high level up-regulation of several iron
uptake and metabolism genes that are part of the aft1/aft2
 xxxd313xxx . tsa2, which encodes an isoform of the cytosolic thioredoxin peroxidase, was strongly induced, but other oxidative
stress defense systems were not induced. the results indicate
that v-atpase activity helps to protect cells from endogenous
oxidative stress.

yeast v-atpase protects against oxidative stress

experimental procedures
materials and strains— xxxd2298xxx  was obtained
from acros.  xxxd2563xxx  and diamide were obtained from
sigma. dihydrorhodamine 123 was obtained from sigma, and
the oxyblot kit was purchased from chemicon international.
yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (yepd) and synthetic complete (sc) were prepared as described (18).
all strains were obtained from the open biosystems or eurofan haploid deletion collections and were based on by4741
(mata his3⌬1 leu2⌬0 met15⌬0 ura3⌬0). all strains in the collection have a complete replacement of the open reading frame
with the kanmx marker in the by4741 background (19). the
by4742  xxxg221xxx ⌬::natr strain was constructed as described (20).
double mutant spores were isolated by mating the indicated
strain from the deletion collection with the by4742  xxxg221xxx ⌬
strain, selecting diploids on yepd containing 200 ␮g/ml kanamycin and 200 ␮g/ml clonnat (werner biolabs) and then
sporulating the resulting diploids and dissecting tetrads on
yepd plates buffered to ph 5. haploid spores resistant to both
kanamycin and clonnat were identified.
the wild-type by4741 and the by4741  xxxg221xxx ⌬ strain were
converted to rho0 strains by extended incubation with 25 ␮g/ml

ethidium bromide as described (21). loss of mitochondrial
dna was confirmed by 4⬘,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
staining.
halo assays for sensitivity to various oxidants were performed as described (22), except that the indicated concentrations of oxidant were added to the filter paper disk after
the disk was placed on an overlay of cells grown to log phase
in liquid culture, mixed with an equal volume of 1% agar, and
then layered onto a yepd plate buffered to either ph 7 or ph
5. the cells were then allowed to grow at 30 °c for 2– 4 days. for
each assay, wild-type and mutant strains were spread at the
same density and grown for identical times. relative halo sizes
were determined by measuring the diameter of the area around
the disk that was clear of cells and dividing this measurement by
the diameter of the halo for wild-type cells treated in parallel
with the same peroxide concentration.
for dilution assays to test peroxide sensitivity,  xxxd2298xxx  was added to sc to give the final concentration indicated.
plates were used within 2 days of the assay. liquid cultures of
strains to be tested were grown to log phase, adjusted to identical density, and then serially diluted (10-fold dilutions) before
spotting on the plates.
genetic and biochemical tests for oxidative stress sensitivity
and oxidative damage—dihydrorhodamine 123 (dhr) staining was performed as described by madeo et al. (23). briefly,
dhr was dissolved in ethanol to make a 2.5-mg/ml stock. liquid cultures of by4741 and by4741  xxxg221xxx ⌬ strains and the corresponding rho0 cells were grown overnight in sc, and dhr
was added to a final concentration of 5 ␮g/ml. cells were
viewed using a zeiss axioskop 2 fluorescence microscope and a
rhodamine filter set after 4.5 h of staining. images were captured using a hamamatsu ccd camera. for quantitation of the
percentage of cells stained with the dye, 280 –350 cells from
each strain were scored in two independent experiments. samples were compared using the two-sample t test assuming equal
variances.
carbonylated proteins were detected by reaction with 2,4dinitrophenyl (dnp) hydrazine and detection of dnp-modified protein by western blotting with rabbit anti-dnp polyclonal antibody according to protocols provided with the
oxyblot kit. yeast cells were prepared as described (24) with the
following modifications. 5 a600 units of each strain were isolated during log phase growth, converted to spheroplasts, and
lysed by the addition of 0.5 ml of cold 0.6 m sorbitol, 1 mm
edta, 50 mm dithiothreitol, ph 7.0, and vortex mixing for 2
min. unlysed cells were pelleted, and the supernatant was used
for derivatization. a mock derivatization, in which all reagents
except dnp-hydrazine were added to the supernatant, was carried out in parallel for each strain. after neutralization of the
reaction, equal amounts of protein for each sample were separated by sds-page and transferred to nitrocellulose for
immunoblotting.
the gfp-yap1 plasmid was a generous gift from scott
moye-rowley (25). the plasmid was transformed into wildtype and  xxxg221xxx ⌬ strains, and transformants were selected and
maintained on fully supplemented minimal medium lacking
uracil. localization of yap1p was visualized after overnight
growth of the cells in sc-uracil.

ification of intracellular compartments (12). all eukaryotic
v-atpases are multisubunit enzymes comprised of a complex
of peripheral membrane proteins, v1, attached to a complex of
integral membrane proteins, vo. deletion of any v-atpase
subunit gene, except vph1 and stv1, which encode organellespecific isoforms of one of the vo subunits, results in a common
vma⫺ phenotype, characterized by a ph-dependent conditional lethality and sensitivity to elevated extracellular calcium
concentrations (12). in addition, vma mutants show a variety of
other defects that are not completely understood, including
poor growth on nonfermentable carbon sources, hypersensitivity to multiple drugs, and increased sensitivity to transition
metals, such as iron, copper, and zinc (15–17).
in this work, we confirm that vma mutants are highly sensitive to oxidative stress, particularly h2o2, and further explore
the basis of this sensitivity. we find that the vma mutants show
evidence of chronic oxidative stress, including elevated ros
levels and protein modifications characteristic of accumulated
oxidative damage, even in the absence of any added oxidant, but
the electron transport chain is not the major source of the stress
in these cells. vma mutations result in a synthetic sensitivity to
peroxide when combined with mutations in many of the components of the cytoplasmic machinery for redox control,
including the cu,zn-superoxide dismutase,  xxxg981xxx ,  xxxg982xxx , thioredoxins, thioredoxin peroxidases, and components of the oxidative arm of the pentose
phosphate pathway, suggesting that vacuolar acidification is
not simply involved in supporting one of these mechanisms
central to redox balance. microarray analysis under conditions
permissive for growth of the  xxxg221xxx  mutant (ph 5) indicates high
level up-regulation of the cytosolic thioredoxin peroxidase
tsa2p and induction of the aft1p/aft2p  xxxd313xxx  in the  xxxg221xxx 
mutant. based on these results, we suggest several possible
explanations for the sensitivity of vma mutants to applied oxidative stresses, such as  xxxd2298xxx .

yeast v-atpase protects against oxidative stress

results
yeast vma mutants are acutely sensitive to oxidative stress—
in order to confirm that the vma mutants were sensitive to
external oxidative stress, we challenged two of the vma deletion
strains,  xxxg221xxx ⌬ and vma3⌬, with several concentrations of
h2o2. these two mutations affect the two different sectors of
the v-atpase;  xxxg221xxx ⌬ lacks the b subunit of the v1 sector but
contains assembled vo sectors at the vacuole, and vma3⌬ lacks
the c subunit of the vo sector and contains assembled v1 sectors
in the cytosol (29). fig. 1a shows a halo assay for wild type,
 xxxg221xxx ⌬, and vma3⌬ in which varied h2o2 concentrations were
applied to filter disks on top of a fresh overlay of cells, and the
size of the area of inhibited growth around the disk provides a
measure of sensitivity (a larger halo indicates sensitivity to a
lower concentration of h2o2 as it diffuses from the filter). it is
clear from fig. 1a that both the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ and vma3⌬ mutants
exhibit much larger halos than the wild-type control strain at
every peroxide concentration tested, suggesting that the
mutant strains are very sensitive to peroxide stress. in fig. 1b,
the sensitivity of the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ strain to two other oxidants, diamide and  xxxd2563xxx , was compared with the wild-type strain.
march 9, 2007 • volume 282 • number 10

the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant is only slightly more sensitive to diamide
than the wild-type strain at ph 5, but there is an increase in its
relative sensitivity at ph 7. in contrast, h2o2 (at the concentrations used in fig. 1a) almost completely inhibits growth of
 xxxg221xxx ⌬ and vma3⌬ cells at neutral ph (data not shown).  xxxd2563xxx  sensitivity could only be measured at elevated ph and
was clearly more pronounced in the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant than in wild
type. the sensitivity of the vma3⌬ mutant to these oxidants was
similar to or slightly greater than that of the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant
(data not shown). these data support previous indications that
vma mutants are sensitive to various forms of applied oxidative
stress but also suggest that the mutants are exquisitely sensitive
to h2o2.
both the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ and vma3⌬ mutations disrupt subunits that
are required for all v-atpase activity in the cell (12). one subunit of the v-atpase, the vo  xxxg220xxx , is present as two
organelle-specific isoforms, vph1p and stv1p, which have
steady state localizations at the vacuole and golgi apparatus/
endosomes, respectively, in wild-type cells (30, 31). fig. 1c
shows that both vph1⌬ and stv1⌬ mutants are much more sensitive to peroxide at ph 5 than wild-type cells, although neither
is as sensitive as the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ or vma3⌬ mutants. these results
suggest that both vacuolar vph1p-containing v-atpases and
the golgi/endosome stv1p containing v-atpases contribute
to resistance to oxidative stress.
as a means of quantitating the relative strength of the sensitivity of the vma mutants to peroxide stress, we compared the
relative halo size of the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ challenged with 2 and 5% peroxide to those of deletions of the two superoxide dismutases
(sod1p and sod2p) in yeast, which are firmly established as
important defenses against oxidative stress (32). as shown in
fig. 1d,  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutants have significantly larger halos than
wild-type cells challenged with 2 and 5% peroxide, consistent
with the data shown in fig. 1a. furthermore, the halo sizes for
the  xxxg221xxx  mutant are comparable with those for either superoxide dismutase mutant, suggesting that loss of v-atpase
activity compromises the resistance of cells to peroxide to a
comparable degree.
vma mutants are under chronic oxidative stress—cells that
are highly sensitive to an applied oxidative stress often contain
elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ros), which can be
present in a number of different chemical forms (33), even in
the absence of an applied stress. an increase in steady-state
ros levels can be detected with redox-sensitive dyes. in order
to compare ros levels in the wild-type and vma mutants, we
incubated the cells with dhr. dhr enters the cell but is nonfluorescent unless it is oxidized by intracellular oxidants to
form rhodamine 123. wild-type and  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutants were
grown overnight in fully supplemented minimal medium, and
then dhr was added for an additional 4.5-h incubation. fig. 2a
shows dhr staining of one field of wild-type and of  xxxg221xxx ⌬
mutants. on average, only 6.75 ⫾ 1.85% of wild-type cells
showed any staining with dhr, but 17.2 ⫾ 0.2% of  xxxg221xxx ⌬ cells
were stained (see also fig. 3b). these results indicate that loss of
v-atpase activity does result in a higher percentage of cells
with ros, consistent with hypersensitivity to oxidative stress in
these cells.

microarray and northern analyses—total yeast rna was
isolated from wild-type and  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant yeast cells grown
to early log phase in yepd, ph 5, as described (26). the total
rna obtained was then further purified using a qiagen
rneasy rna purification kit, and then the quality and quantity of the rna was analyzed using an agilent rna nanochip
on an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. duplicate rna samples
(from two independent isolations from the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ strain and a
single isolation from the wild-type strain) were subjected to
microarray analysis using affymetrix yeast gen2 chips and
standard eukaryotic one-cycle amplification and labeling procedures. arrays were scanned on a genechip 3000 scanner
(affymetrix) and analyzed by genechip operating system software (affymetrix) to generate present and absent calls and
assess sample quality. subsequently, the .cel format image files
were imported into genespring gx (agilent) and normalized
using the robust multiarray average method (27). for this
report, we determined the fraction of genes that were increased
or decreased in the mutant versus wild type strains at the twotailed 99th percentile confidence level (defined as ⫾2.58 s.d.
values from the mean expression ratio comparing the two
strains). in the present study, this translated to cut-off values of
2.1-fold up or down in assessing changes in expression in the
mutant strains (see supplemental fig. 1).
for northern analysis, two independent rna samples were
prepared from both the wild type and  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant as
described above. rna was separated on a 2.2 m formaldehyde
denaturing gel, transferred by capillary action to duralon membrane, and fixed to the blot by uv cross-linking (260 nm for 1
min), as described by sambrook and russell (28). probes against
the indicated genes were prepared by pcr amplification of
250 – 400-bp regions of the open reading frames of the genes,
followed by labeling with [␣-32p]dctp using a stratagene
prime-it random primer labeling kit. blots were hybridized
with the probes as described (28) and then washed and analyzed
on an amersham biosciences typhoon phosphorimager.

bonylated protein have frequently
been used as a measure of chronic
oxidative stress (24, 35). we
detected protein carbonylation
using the oxyblot system, in which
carbonylated proteins are further
derivatized with dnp, which can
then be detected by western blotting. as shown in fig. 2b, lysates
from wild-type cells contain very
little dnp-reactive carbonylated
protein, but the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant
contains high levels of protein carbonylation, even though no extracellular oxidant was added in these
experiments.
what is the source of ros accumulation in the vma mutants?—reactive oxygen species can arise from
a number of different sources and
processes, but mitochondria, and
specifically the respiratory chain,
are frequently one of the major
sources (36). in yeast, at least one
subunit of each complex of the electron transport chain is encoded by
mitochondrial dna, and the cells
can survive by fermentative growth
in the absence of mitochondrial
dna and respiratory function.
therefore, respiration can be totally
abolished by inducing the loss of
mitochondrial dna. we selected
wild-type and  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutants that
had lost mitochondrial dna (rho0
cells) and then determined whether
the rho0 versions of the two strains
were more or less sensitive to oxidative stress. as shown in fig. 3a, loss
of mitochondrial dna did not

cell growth due to h2o2 diffusion from the disk, and the size of these “halos” is dependent on the sensitivity of as would be expected if the respithe strain to h2o2 (22). there was no growth inhibition around a control disk to which no h2o2 was applied (not ratory chain were the major source

against the respiratory chain as the major source of endogenous oxidative stress in the vma mutants.
it is still possible that mitochondria contribute to oxidative
stress in cells grown in nonfermentable carbon sources, where
respiration is required and ros production from the respiratory chain may be unavoidable. like many strains that are sensitive to oxidative stress (32), vma mutants are unable to grow at
typical concentrations of nonfermentable carbon sources,
although it is possible to isolate metabolically normal mitochondria from the mutants (38). supek et al. (39) reported that
vma mutants were able to grow at lower concentrations of nonjournal of biological chemistry

fermentable carbon sources, also suggesting that defective respiration is not the cause of the petite phenotype in the vma
mutants. we assessed the growth of the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant at varied concentrations of two different nonfermentable carbon
sources, glycerol/ethanol and lactate. as shown in fig. 3c, the
 xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant cannot grow on 3% glycerol plus 2% ethanol or
on 3% lactate, although the wild-type strain grows vigorously
under both conditions. however, the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant was able
to grow in the presence of 3% glycerol without added ethanol or
0.3% lactate.
there are numerous defense systems against oxidative
stress in yeast, including the cytosolic cu/zn-superoxide
dismutase sod1p, thioredoxin trx2p and thioredoxindependent peroxidase tsa1p,  xxxd2213xxx  (synthesized and regenerated by  xxxg982xxx  gsh1p and
 xxxg981xxx  glr1p, respectively), and the oxidative
arm of the pentose phosphate pathway (33). complementing
these cytosolic defense systems are some similar proteins
localized to the mitochondria, including a mitochondrial
thioredoxin, trx3p, and the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase sod2p. mutations in each of these defense
systems result in increased sensitivity to challenge with
extracellular oxidant (1, 33). we reasoned that double
mutants lacking both the v-atpase and one of these defense
systems might provide clues to the source of the endogenous
oxidative stress in the vma mutants. we tested this hypothesis by crossing the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant to haploid deletions in
several major cytosolic and mitochondrial antioxidant
defense systems, selecting diploids, and then sporulating the
diploids and dissecting tetrads to obtain double mutant
spores. spores were allowed to germinate on yepd medium
buffered to ph 5, conditions that are optimal for growth of
vma deletion mutants and that appear to minimize sensitivity to exogenous oxidative stress. viable double mutant
spores were obtained for crosses of  xxxg221xxx ⌬ with trx2⌬,
tsa1⌬, gsh1⌬, glr1⌬, and zwf1⌬, and in fig. 4a, the growth of
several of the double mutant spores on sc and sc medium
containing 0.5 mm h2o2 concentration is compared. in general, the double mutant spores are clearly more sensitive to
 xxxd2298xxx  than the single mutants. although double mutant spores were obtained by dissection on yepd ph
5, the gsh1⌬ xxxg221xxx ⌬ double mutant was not only unable to
grow in the presence of low peroxide concentrations (data
not shown) but also was unable to grow at all on supplemented minimal medium. this indicates a synthetic effect of
the gsh1⌬ and  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutations that is manifest even in the
absence of additional oxidative stress. all of the other mutations tested showed increased sensitivity to oxidative stress
when combined with the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutation, but the increase
in sensitivity appears to be more pronounced for the cytosolic defense system mutants shown in fig. 4a, trx2⌬ and
glr1⌬, than for the mitochondrial defense system mutants,
trx3⌬ and sod2⌬.
in similar dissections of a diploid heterozygous for sod1⌬ and
 xxxg221xxx ⌬, we were not able to obtain double mutant spores, as
shown in fig. 4b. this suggests that the two mutations are synthetically lethal, even on the yepd, ph 5, plates used for dissection. however, both sod1⌬ and  xxxg221xxx ⌬ have defects in spore

that there is a highly significant enrichment for genes in two
general categories: 1) metal ion (particularly iron) transport
and homeostasis and 2) arginine/glutamine/ornithine biosynthesis and metabolism.
to begin to assess the extent to which the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant is
responding transcriptionally to oxidative stress, we compared
the set of genes up-regulated or down-regulated by at least
4-fold in the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ strain to the published sets of genes
changed by at least 4-fold in response to a grx5⌬ mutation or
20-min treatment with 0.3 mm h2o2 (5, 40). the grx5 null
mutant has been used as a model of yeast cells under chronic,
modest oxidative stress (40). grx5p is a mitochondrial  xxxg905xxx , and in its absence, cells accumulate carbonylated proteins even in the absence of applied oxidative stress (41), symptomatic of chronic oxidative stress (see fig. 2). transcriptional
response to an acute challenge to h2o2 was measured by gasch
et al. (5) in the context of determining common features in
response to environmental stress. only 5323 genes were available in all three data sets for comparison, but of these, 264 genes
showed a 4-fold change in at least one of the three data sets, and
three-way correlations of these genes are shown in fig. 5. there
was very little correlation between the acutely stressed h2o2treated cells and the chronically stressed grx5 mutant (r2 ⫽
0.0038). the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant data correlated better with each of
these data sets, showing an r2 ⫽ 0.060 with the grx5 data and an
r2 ⫽ 0.092 with the h2o2 treatment data. taken together, these
data indicate that the transcriptional response to loss of vma2p
has elements in common with responses seen in these models
for chronic and acute oxidative stress but also has clear differences. tabulated data used to generate fig. 5 are shown in supplemental table 2. as part of this analysis, we were also able to
identify which genes were changed by at least 4-fold in more
than one data set. only eight genes were changed by at least
4-fold in more than one data set, and all were increased. five
of these, fit3, fit2, arn1, arn2, and ybr047w, have previously been implicated in iron and/or copper homeostasis
(42, 43). each of these genes was up-regulated by at least
2.9-fold in all three data sets, suggesting that they are strong
common components.
because of the potential for links between perturbed metal
ion homeostasis and oxidative stress, we probed northern blots
of two independent rna preparations from the wild-type and
 xxxg221xxx ⌬ genes for several of the genes that are implicated in
iron/copper homeostasis and that showed altered expression in
the microarray. the results are shown in fig. 6. the northern
blots show a clear up-regulation of mrnas for fit2, which
encodes one of a family of cell wall mannoproteins that assist in
iron uptake; sit1 and  xxxg1269xxx , which both encode iron-siderophore transporters; fre2, an iron reductase at the plasma
membrane; hmx1, an er-localized heme degradation enzyme
required for recovery of iron from heme; and fet3, required for
high affinity iron transporter at the plasma membrane (44 – 46).
in contrast, the major high affinity transporter of copper at the
plasma membrane, encoded by  xxxg321xxx  (47), is down-regulated in
the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ cells. although most enzymes previously identified
as up-regulated in response to an applied oxidative stress are
not significantly up-regulated, there is a large up-regulation of
tsa2, which encodes an isoform of thioredoxin peroxidase.

type  xxxg221xxx , and then crossed, selected for diploids, and dissected tetrads. as shown in fig. 4b, under these conditions,
four-spore tetrads could be obtained. the  xxxg221xxx -containing
plasmid contained a ura3 marker, so we tested for the presence of the plasmid in each spore by determining growth on
medium lacking uracil and also transferred the spores to
medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid, a negative selection for
the ura3 marker. two viable spores (boxed in fig. 4b) contained both the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ and sod1⌬ mutations and also showed
some growth on 5-fluoroorotic acid, indicating that they were
able to lose the  xxxg221xxx  plasmid. these spores showed very slow
growth and poor viability and could not be tested further for
oxidant sensitivity. therefore, sod1⌬  xxxg221xxx ⌬ double mutant
spores can be obtained but have a very severe synthetic growth
defect, even in the absence of an imposed oxidative stress. in
contrast, sod2⌬ xxxg221xxx ⌬ spores, shown for comparison in fig. 4b,
were readily obtained from tetrad dissection and grew well on
yepd, ph 5, suggesting that there is a much less severe synthetic defect between the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase
mutant and the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant.
taken together, these results indicate that most of the
major cytosolic mechanisms for handling oxidative stress are
operating in the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant. in fact, they are critical for
its optimal growth, because double mutants exhibit increased sensitivity to low concentrations of h2o2 and poorer
growth even in the absence of added oxidant in some cases.
therefore, it is unlikely that the sensitivity of the v-atpase
mutants to oxidative stress is coming from their inability to
support one of these mechanisms, but instead, loss of
v-atpase activity must help to create an additional source
of increased oxidative stress. loss of mitochondrial protection systems aggravates the sensitivity of the vma mutants to
oxidative stress but less severely than loss of the parallel
cytoplasmic systems.
microarray analysis indicates dramatically perturbed
metal ion homeostasis and up-regulation of tsa2 in a
 xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant—the overall transcriptional profile of a cell
can provide critical insights into its physiological state. in an
effort to better understand potential sources of oxidative
stress in the vma mutants, we grew both wild-type cells and
a congenic  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant to log phase in yepd, ph 5, prepared rna, and then performed microarray analysis to compare the transcriptional profiles of the two strains. genes
that were up-regulated or down-regulated 2.1-fold or more
(calculated to be at the 99th percentile confidence level as
described under “experimental procedures”) in the  xxxg221xxx ⌬
strain are listed in supplemental table 1. these data were
analyzed using the saccharomyces genome database gene
ontology (go) term finder program to extract go terms
that are enriched in the up-regulated or down-regulated
gene sets relative to the entire set of yeast genes on the
microarray. the results from the set of up-regulated genes
were particularly notable in the context of the oxidative
stress sensitivity of the  xxxg221xxx  mutant. table 1 lists the go
process terms that were calculated to have a p value (probability of random association) of ⬍0.01 for this set of genes as
well as the enrichment of each term in the data set relative to
its representation in the genome. it is clear from this analysis

overall, the northern results parallel those from microarray
analysis and help to validate that analysis (fig. 6 and supplemental table 1), although the microarray tended to underestimate the magnitude of the change in most cases. comparative studies of quantitative reverse transcription-pcr
and microarray methodologies have noted that although
robust multiarray average-based normalization greatly
reduces the false positive rate, it also tends to underestimate
the magnitude of real changes compared with quantitative
real time reverse transcription-pcr, particularly for low
abundance transcripts (48, 49).
many of the genes involved in iron and copper homeostasis
are under control of the aft1p and/or aft2p transcription factors (50, 51). the set of genes under control of these transcription factors is collectively known as the aft1/aft2  xxxd313xxx . upregulation of the aft1/aft2  xxxd313xxx  in the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant was
not entirely unexpected, because vma mutants have previously
been shown to be iron-deprived, possibly as a result of failure to
mature fet3p, the multicopper oxidase required for high affinity iron transport, in an acidic compartment (52). if failure to

mature fet3p and the resultant iron deprivation and up-regulation of the aft1/aft2  xxxd313xxx  is the source of the oxidative
stress sensitivity in the vma mutants, then a fet3⌬ mutant
should be as sensitive as the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant. fig. 7 shows a
direct comparison of the peroxide sensitivity of the fet3⌬
mutant and  xxxg221xxx ⌬. it is clear that the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant is much
more sensitive to peroxide stress than the fet3⌬ mutant. we
quantitated relative halo size for the fet3⌬ mutant in two independent experiments (as shown for the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant in fig.
1d) and found that the mean halo size was 1.05- and 1.1-fold
that of the wild-type strain in the presence of 2 and 5% h2o2,
respectively. based on these data, loss of fet3p function cannot
account for the sensitivity of the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant to oxidative
stress.

grx5⌬, and wild-type (wt) cells treated for 20 min with 0.3 mm h2o2.
genes showing at least a 4-fold change of expression between  xxxg221xxx ⌬ and
wild-type cells (this study), grx5⌬ (a model of wild-type chronic oxidative
stress), and wild-type cells (40) or wild-type cells with and without a 20-min
treatment with 0.3 mm h2o2 (a model of acute oxidative stress (5)) were identified, and the expression of these genes among the three experiments was
compared. 264 genes changed by at least 4-fold in at least one of the data sets
and thus are included in the comparison. log2 changes for each of these
genes are plotted against the other two and used to calculate the indicated r2
value.

we deliberately chose to assess sensitivity to oxidative stress in
strains containing deletions in a v1 sector subunit ( xxxg221xxx ⌬) and
a vo sector subunit (vma3⌬) that are both found in all yeast
v-atpases as well as the two vo  xxxg220xxx  isoforms (vph1⌬ and
stv1⌬), each found in a subset of v-atpases. we found that all
were sensitive, suggesting that sensitivity is a general feature of
loss of v-atpase activity. the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ and vma3⌬ mutants
were more sensitive than the vph1⌬ and stv1⌬ mutants, but this
is expected, because the latter two mutants only lack a subset of
v-atpase complexes. the vma3⌬ mutant may be slightly more
sensitive to peroxide (fig. 1a) and other oxidants (data not
shown) than the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant. this difference is harder to
explain, because both mutations abolish all v-atpase activity.
however, vma3p has also been suggested to play a role in
vacuole-vacuole fusion independent from v1 subunits (53),
and it is possible that an additional function could account
for the small increase in sensitivity to oxidative stress. taken
together with the previous data, these results suggest that
loss of v-atpase function is responsible for the sensitivity to
oxidative stress and that loss of function in both the vacuolar
and golgi/endosome compartments may contribute to this
sensitivity.
increased susceptibility to oxidative stress may also account
for other characteristics of vma mutants. the inability of vma
mutants to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources has long
been rather puzzling, particularly since ohya et al. (38) demonstrated that the mutant cells have normal rates of respiration as
well as normal levels of several respiratory chain enzymes in
isolated mitochondria. these experiments argued against the
inability to synthesize respiratory enzymes (e.g. as a result of
defects in metal ion trafficking or distribution (54)) as the
source of the growth defect in the vma strains. however, many
mutants sensitive to oxidative stress fail to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources, presumably because they cannot tolerate the levels of superoxide and other ros produced as side
products of respiration (7). we have also found that vma
mutants are very slow to return to log phase growth after they
have grown to high density.4 this is also characteristic of certain mutants sensitive to oxidative stress, because they poorly
tolerate the diauxic switch that accompanies consumption of
available glucose and the metabolic transition from fermentation to consumption of ethanol (55–58). the ability of the vma
mutants to grow on low, but not high, concentrations of nonfermentable carbon sources (fig. 4a) (39) may also be consistent with their sensitivity to oxidative stress. supek et al. (39),
who first observed this phenomenon, hypothesized that vacuolar function was required for storage (or possibly metabolism)
of excess respiratory metabolites. these “excess metabolites”
could be ros produced as a side product of rapid respiration.
however, the growth of the vma mutants on low concentrations of nonfermentable carbon sources also seems to be somewhat paradoxical, because there is general agreement that at
high levels of respiratory activity lower levels of ros are produced (36, 59). further work will be necessary to fully understand the connections between mitochondrial function and
oxidative stress in the vma mutants.

potential sources of oxidative
stress in vma mutants—although
sensitivity to oxidative stress may
account for the inability of the vma
mutants to grow on standard concentrations of nonfermentable carbon sources, superoxide production
from the respiratory chain, generally considered a major source of
cellular ros (60), does not account
for the peroxide sensitivity of the
 xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant. a number of different mutants that are sensitive to oxidative stress show improved growth
in the absence of mitochondrial
dna (37, 61). eviction of mitochondrial dna from  xxxg221xxx ⌬
mutant to form the  xxxg221xxx ⌬rho0
mutant did not improve the general
growth properties of the mutant or
its resistance to peroxide challenge

not the major source of ros.
we reasoned that the vma mutants might be affecting one of
the other major mechanisms for resistance to oxidative stress
(e.g. by perturbing metal ion access for assembly of superoxide
dismutase). although we cannot completely eliminate this possibility, the strong synthetic phenotypes of mutants lacking
both  xxxg221xxx ⌬ and several other mechanisms argue that loss of
v-atpase function creates an additional source of stress.
the strong up-regulation of the aft1/aft2  xxxd313xxx  in the
 xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant also highlights the potential importance of the
v-atpase in metal ion homeostasis and suggests some possible
sources of oxidative stress sensitivity. davis-kaplan et al. (52)
previously showed that vma mutants have low levels of cellular
iron that may be attributed to the requirement for an acidic
post-golgi compartment for insertion of the copper cluster
into apo-fet3p. iron deprivation and/or loss of fet3p function
has also been associated with increased sensitivity to other transition metals because of up-regulation of less specific transporters (63). because some of these metals are redox-active, they
could contribute to oxidative stress. however, we do not believe
that the iron deprivation that occurs in vma mutants is solely
responsible for the oxidative stress. first, if loss of fet3p maturation were the root cause of the sensitivity of  xxxg221xxx ⌬ to oxidative stress, then the fet3⌬ mutant should be as sensitive to oxidative stress as the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant, but it is not (fig. 7). second,

of other metals by competition under conditions where less
specific transporters were up-regulated (63). in addition,
although the aft1/aft2  xxxd313xxx  clearly has an iron-sensitive
input, it is also induced in conditions other than direct iron
deprivation, including chronic oxidative stress (40). in fact,
cells become somewhat more sensitive to oxidative stress in the
absence of aft1p and much more sensitive in the absence of
both aft1p and aft2p (50). this suggests that up-regulation of
the aft1/aft2  xxxd313xxx  could be a response to the oxidative
stress in the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant rather than a cause.
significantly, in the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant, we did not see a dramatic
up-regulation of the oxidative stress response genes controlled
by yap1p and skn7p, which are strongly up-regulated in
response to an acute oxidative stress (5, 64). consistent with
this, we did not see a strong nuclear concentration of gfpyap1p (25) in the  xxxg221xxx  mutant grown in the absence of applied
oxidant, although gfp-yap1p was translocated to the nucleus
within 15 min of h2o2 addition (data now shown). microarray
analysis of the grx5⌬ mutant indicated little up-regulation of
yap1- or skn7-dependent genes but did show a strong up-regulation of the aft1/aft2  xxxd313xxx , similar to that seen in the
 xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant (40). however, the comparison with microarray
data from cells treated for 20 min with h2o2 (fig. 5) does suggest that there are at least some common features between transcriptional response to  xxxg221xxx ⌬ and an acute oxidative challenge
with h2o2.
in conclusion, we do not fully understand the source of the
chronic oxidative stress seen in the  xxxg221xxx ⌬ mutant, but we can
propose several potential sources. first, it is entirely possible
that improper distribution or utilization of one or more metals
contributes to the oxidative stress, although a simple explanation based on iron deprivation does not seem sufficient. in a
recent genomic dissection of the s. cerevisiae “ionome,” the
v-atpase was identified as a major player in uptake and distribution of multiple different metals (15). it is also possible that
altered ph homeostasis in the vma mutants leads to an environment that extends the lifetime of certain ros or otherwise
changes their metabolism. regardless of the mechanism, the
v-atpase appears to play a unique and essential role in resistance to oxidative stress that may be important in other eukaryotic cells as well.
