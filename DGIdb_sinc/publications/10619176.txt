bilobalide, a constituent of  xxxd2199xxx ,
inhibits nmda-induced  xxxg1759xxx  activation
and phospholipid breakdown in rat hippocampus
received: 20 april 1999 / accepted: 5 august 1999 / published online: 29 october 1999

abstract in rat hippocampal slices superfused with magnesium-free buffer, glutamate (1 mm) caused the release
of large amounts of choline due to phospholipid breakdown. this phenomenon was mimicked by n-methyl-daspartate (nmda) in a calcium-sensitive manner and was
blocked by nmda receptor antagonists such as mk-801
and 7-chlorokynurenate. the nmda-induced release of
choline was not caused by activation of phospholipase d
but was mediated by  xxxg1759xxx  ( xxxg1760xxx ) activation
as the release of choline was accompanied by the formation of lyso-phosphatidylcholine (lyso-pc) and glycerophospho-choline (gpch) and was blocked by 5-[2-(2-carboxyethyl)-4-dodecanoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrrol-1-yl]pentanoic acid, a  xxxg1760xxx  inhibitor. bilobalide, a constituent of
 xxxd2199xxx , inhibited the nmda-induced efflux of
choline with an ic50 value of 2.3 µm and also prevented
the formation of lyso-pc and gpch. nmda also caused
a release of choline in vivo when infused into the hippocampus of freely moving rats by retrograde dialysis.
again, the effect was completely inhibited by bilobalide
which was administered systemically (20 mg/kg i.p.).
interestingly, convulsions which were observed in the
nmda-treated rats were almost totally suppressed by
bilobalide. we conclude that release of choline is a sensitive marker for nmda-induced  xxxg1759xxx  activation and phospholipid breakdown. bilobalide inhibited
the glutamatergic excitotoxic membrane breakdown both
in vitro and in vivo, an effect which may be beneficial in

introduction
excitotoxicity is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic neurodegeneration (e.g.,
stroke, alzheimer’s disease). the postulated sequence of
events includes high extracellular concentrations of glutamate, excessive stimulation of glutamate receptors mainly
of the nmda subtype, and influx of large amounts of calcium into neurons. calcium overload leads to the activation of catabolic enzymes including proteases, nucleases
and phospholipases (rothman and olney 1995).
one important process during neuronal degeneration is
the breakdown of membrane phospholipids. reductions of
phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, and
increases of their catabolic products, have been reported in
postmortem samples taken from alzheimer brains (nitsch
et al. 1992) although a causal relationship to excitotoxic
damage could not be established as yet. a large body of
evidence, however, has accumulated for the breakdown of
phospholipids in experimental models of hypoxia, ischemia
and seizures. thus, phospholipid hydrolysis is reflected in
an increase of free  xxxd2154xxx  following ischemia (bazan
1970; katsura et al. 1993) and electroconvulsive shock
(bazan 1970; flynn and wecker 1987), and activations of
both  xxxg1759xxx  ( xxxg1760xxx ) and phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase c have been implied in this response
(ikeda et al. 1986; katsura et al. 1993). recent work has
mainly focussed on the calcium-dependent isoforms of
 xxxg1760xxx  (for review, see bazan et al. 1995; farooqui et al.
1997). in vivo,  xxxg1760xxx  enzymatic activity is increased after
ischemia/reperfusion (rordorf et al. 1991) and closed
head injury (shohami et al. 1989). in vitro, this response
could be linked to glutamatergic activation (kim et al.
1995).  xxxg1760xxx -mediated release of  xxxd2154xxx  was caused

610

by nmda receptor activation in neuronal cultures (dumuis et al. 1988; lazarewicz et al. 1988), brain slices
(pellerin and wolfe 1991) and in hippocampus in vivo
(katayama et al. 1994; lazarewicz and salinska 1995).
 xxxg1760xxx  activation may contribute to neuronal degeneration
by several mechanisms including membrane breakdown,
formation of free  xxxd208xxx , an inhibitor of glutamate uptake (barbour et al. 1989), and formation of lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-pc), the precursor of plateletactivating factor (paf; bazan et al. 1995). furthermore,
 xxxg1760xxx  activation has been related to the processing of
 xxxg178xxx  (emmerling et al. 1993) and
the induction of  xxxg1884xxx  (miettinen et al. 1997).
the prominent role of calcium-dependent  xxxg1760xxx  ( xxxg1228xxx   xxxg1763xxx )
in neuronal injury was recently confirmed by the relative
resistance of  xxxg1228xxx   xxxg1763xxx  knockout mice against ischemic and
mptp-induced neuronal damage (bonventre et al. 1997;
klivenyi et al. 1998).
standardized extracts of the green leaves of ginkgo
biloba, e.g. egb 761, have antioxidative, vascular and
neuroprotective effects (defeudis 1998) and are widely
prescribed in europe for the treatment of cerebrovascular
and neurodegenerative disorders. the beneficial effects of
egb 761 in experimental models of cerebral hypoxia and
ischemia have mainly been ascribed to the ginkgolides
which have potent paf-antagonistic actions (karcher et
al. 1984; oberpichler et al. 1990). egb 761 has also been
shown to inhibit the accumulation of  xxxd2154xxx  induced
by electroconvulsive shock; again, this action was attributed to ginkgolide b (birkle et al. 1988; rodriguez de
turco et al. 1993). however, bilobalide, a sesquiterpene
lactone which constitutes approximately 3% of egb 761,
was the most active compound in studies on the consequences of hypoxia in hippocampal slices (klein et al.
1997) and endothelial cells (janssens et al. 1995) and on
apoptotic cell death in neuronal cultures (ahlemeyer et al.
1999). the present study demonstrates that bilobalide has
potent inhibitory actions on the nmda-induced activation of  xxxg1759xxx  and the associated phospholipid
breakdown in the brain.
part of this work was published in abstract form
(hilgert et al. 1999).

materials and methods
animals. male wistar rats (250–350 g; charles river, sulzfeld,
germany) were kept under standardised light/dark (12 h), temperature (22°c) and humidity (70%) conditions, with rat chow and
water available ad libitum.
preparation and superfusion of hippocampal slices. on the day of
the experiment, the animals were decapitated, and hippocampal
slices (400 µm) were prepared and superfused at 35°c with magnesium-free tyrode solution of the following composition (in
mm): nacl, 137; kcl, 2.7; cacl2, 1.8; nah2po4, 0.2; nahco3,
11.9; glucose, 5.6. in some experiments, mgcl2 (1.05 mm) was
present. all superfusion solutions were continuously gassed with
carbogen (95% o2, 5% co2). the slices were first incubated with
0.1 mm di-isopropyl- xxxd3217xxx  (dfp) for 30 min in order to
prevent choline release from acetylcholine by the action of acetylcholinesterase. subsequently, the slices were washed for 40 min,

and basal choline efflux was determined. glutamate, nmda and
(+)-mk-801 (tocris cookson, bristol, uk) were added in tyrode;
bilobalide,  xxxd1709xxx  and 7-chlorokynurenate (tocris cookson, bristol, uk) were added in dmso. the final dmso concentrations in
tyrode solution (0.1%) did not affect choline efflux. the superfusates were collected at 5-min or 10-min intervals and analyzed
for choline content.
determination of choline by luminometry. choline efflux was determined by a chemiluminescence assay (israel and lesbats 1982).
briefly, 10-µl aliquots of the superfusates were given to a reaction
mixture consisting of 20 mm  xxxd3449xxx , ph 8.6, 1 µg luminol, 10 µg
peroxidase, and 1.25 u choline oxidase, and the chemiluminescence resulting from oxidation of choline to betaine was measured
at 425 nm in a lkb-wallac luminometer. the assay was linear
from 1–5 pmol choline. the data for choline efflux (figs. 1, 2, 3)
are expressed in % of basal choline efflux which was 72.7±6.4
pmol/min per mg protein (n=22).
determination of lyso-phosphatidylcholine (lyso-pc) and glycerophosphocholine (gpch). for these experiments, the slices were
prelabelled for 2 h with 10 µci methyl-[3h]choline (dupont nen,
bad homburg, germany); dfp was added for the final 30 min.
superfusion of the slices was as described above. at the end of the
incubation, the slices were homogenized and biphasically extracted according to bligh and dyer (1959). choline metabolites
were analyzed as described previously (klein et al. 1992). the hydrophilic phase was separated in 1.5% nacl/methanol/concentrated ammonia (10:10:1), and gpch was separated from choline
and  xxxd2929xxx  at rf=0.69. lyso-pc was separated from pc
and other phospholipids using chloroform/methanol/concentrated
ammonia (22:18:1). the metabolites were visualized with iodine
vapor, scraped off, and the radioactivity was measured in a
packard tricarb scintillation counter.
determination of phospholipase d activity. phospholipase d (pld)
activity was determined using the specific transphosphatidylation
assay as described previously (klein et al. 1998). briefly, the phospholipids were labelled with [3h]glycerol (40 µci/ml; dupont
nen, bad homburg, germany) for 2 h. after a 30-min wash, the
slices were exposed to nmda in the presence of 2% ethanol. after 30 min, the slices were extracted according to bligh and dyer
(1959), the phospholipids were separated by tlc, and the spots
corresponding to phosphatidylcholine (pc) and phosphatidylethanol (peth) were isolated and counted for radioactivity in a scintillation counter. pld activity was expressed as [% peth/pc].
microdialysis experiment. i-shaped, concentric probes were manufactured according to santiago and westerink (1990). the probes
had an outside diameter of 0.24 mm and an exchange length of
4 mm and were equipped with a dialysis membrane (filtral an-69
hf; hospal, meyzieu, france) with a molecular weight cutoff of
10,000 da. for probe implantation, the rats were anaesthesised
with pentobarbital (60–80 mg/kg i.p.) and placed in a stereotactic
frame. the probe was implanted into the right ventral hippocampus using the following coordinates (from lambda): ap +2.5 mm;
l –5.8 mm; dv –7.5 mm (paxinos and watson 1986). the experiments were carried out on freely moving animals on the first and
second day following surgery. the microdialysis probes were perfused at a constant rate of 2.0 µl/min with a low-magnesium artificial cerebrospinal fluid (concentrations in mm: nacl 147; kcl 4;
cacl2 1.2; mgcl2 0.12) containing 10 µm neostigmine. after four
samples had been taken to estimate the basal efflux of choline, the
perfusion fluid was changed to a solution containing 1 mm nmda.
in some experiments, the rats were pretreated by i.p. injection with
bilobalide (20 mg/kg) 1 h prior to the start of nmda infusion.
aliquots of the dialysis fluid were collected in 15-min intervals
and analyzed for choline by hplc.
hplc analysis of choline. microdialysis samples were injected directly into the hplc which consisted of a bas pm-80 pump,
polymer column (350×1 mm) and enzyme reactor carrying immo-

611
bilized choline oxidase (bas sepstick), and an electrochemical
detector equipped with a platinum electrode operating at +500 mv
(bas lc4c). the eluent (flow rate: 130 µl/min) consisted of 29
mm nah2po4, 22 mm sodium acetate and 0.37 mm edta (ph
8.4). the retention time for choline was 13 min, the detection limit
50 fmol/5 µl injection volume. choline efflux was calculated as %
of basal efflux which was defined as the average output of four
consecutive samples that did not differ by more than 10%.

results
effects of nmda receptor agonists and antagonists
the basal efflux of choline from rat hippocampal slices
(1.51±0.07 pmol/10 µl, n=22) was constant throughout
the experimental period and was unchanged in the absence of magnesium (fig. 1a). basal choline efflux was
not affected by glutamate (1 mm) in the presence of magnesium (1.05 mm mg2+) but was increased within 5 min
in magnesium-free solution (fig. 1a). higher concentrations of glutamate (3 mm and 10 mm) induced choline release even in the presence of magnesium (data not shown).
the effect of glutamate in magnesium-free solution was
not further increased in the presence of glycine (10 µm)
but was reduced by half in calcium-free solution (data not
shown). exposure of slices to depolarizing agents such as
kcl (30 mm) or  xxxd1804xxx  (50 µm) did not affect
choline release (data not shown).
a rapid increase in choline efflux was also seen when
the slices were superfused with nmda (100 µm) in magnesium-free buffer (fig. 1b). this nmda effect was
slightly potentiated by glycine (10 µm) and was almost
completely suppressed in the absence of calcium (fig.
1b). glycine alone did not affect choline efflux in magnesium-free tyrode (data not shown). the nmda-evoked
choline release was almost completely antagonized by the
antagonist at the glycine site of the nmda receptor, 7chlorokynurenic acid (cka; 1 µm), and by the nmda
receptor channel blocker, mk-801 (dizolcipine; 10 µm;
fig. 1c).
effects of bilobalide in vitro
the nmda-evoked release of choline was completely
suppressed by bilobalide in a concentration-dependent
manner (1–100 µm; fig. 2a). the ic50 value for bilobalide
was 2.3 µm (confidence interval: 1.7–3.2 µm, r2=0.998;
fig. 2b).
in order to more closely specify the site of action of
bilobalide we determined the nmda-induced changes of
the tissue levels of choline metabolites and the effect of
bilobalide. after 30 min of incubation, nmda (100 µm)
caused significant increases of [3h]lyso-pc (+64%; fig.
3a) and of [3h]gpch (+83%; fig. 3b), indicating an activation of  xxxg1759xxx . these nmda-induced increases in lyso-pc and gpch were efficiently counteracted by bilobalide (10 µm; fig. 3a,b). the basal tissue
levels of both metabolites were not significantly altered

( xxxg1228xxx   xxxg1763xxx ) and calcium-independent ( xxxg1764xxx ) cytoplasmic
 xxxg1760xxx  forms, could not be tested because both compounds
caused a massive release of choline from the slices
in mg2+-free tyrode solution (data not shown). 5-[2-(2carboxyethyl)-4-dodecanoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrrol-1-yl]pentanoic acid ( xxxd1709xxx ), a compound which was recently
shown to inhibit platelet  xxxg1228xxx   xxxg1763xxx  with an ic50 value of
3.9 µm (lehr 1997), caused only a minor, delayed release
of choline by itself and largely suppressed the nmdaevoked choline efflux at a concentration of 1–10 µm (fig.
3c). in contrast, bromoenollactone (bel; 1 µm), a specific  xxxg1764xxx  inhibitor (balsinde et al. 1999), did not affect
nmda-induced choline release (data not shown).
in separate experiments, the possibility was excluded
that the nmda-induced efflux of choline was due to
stimulation of phospholipase d (pld) activity which directly cleaves choline from phosphatidylcholine. pld activity was 0.52±0.04% (label associated with phosphatidylethanol, see materials and methods) under basal conditions and 0.54±0.04% in the presence of nmda (100 µm,
mg-free solution; n=3). bilobalide (10 µm) also did not
affect hippocampal pld activity (data not shown).

nmda-evoked release of choline:
effects of bilobalide in vivo
finally, we tested the effects of nmda and bilobalide on
choline release in vivo using the microdialysis technique
to sample extracellular fluid from the brain of awake,
freely moving rats. infusion of 1 mm nmda directly into
the hippocampus in a low-magnesium medium (0.12 mm
mg2+) caused an immediate, almost linear increase of
choline release during the 90 min of observation (fig. 4a).

discussion
release of choline as a method
to monitor nmda receptor activation

fig. 4 a nmda-induced release of choline in vivo: effect of
bilobalide. microdialysis probes were implanted into the ventral
hippocampus, perfused with artificial csf containing 0.12 mm
magnesium, and choline efflux was measured using hplc. half of
the animals received bilobalide (20 mg/kg) by i.p. injection 60 min
before nmda infusion (bilo); the other half received saline (ctr).
at time zero, artificial csf containing nmda (1 mm) was infused into the hippocampus for 90 min, and choline release was
measured in 15-min samples in control (nmda) and bilobalidepretreated (nmda + bilo) animals. data are means ± sem of 4
experiments each. b convulsive signs in the animals during
nmda infusion. the nmda group received only nmda, the
nmda + bilo group was pretreated with bilobalide as described in
a. convulsive signs were rated according to the scale of racine
(1972): 0 no convulsive signs, 1 mouth and facial movements, 2
head nodding, 3 forelimb clonus, 4 rearing, 5 rearing and falling
(full motor seizure)

in these experiments, nmda caused convulsions including forelimb clonus, rearing, and full motor seizure
(fig. 4b); it should be noted that nmda, at this concentration, does not cause neurodegeneration (vanicky et al.
1998). pretreatment of the rats with bilobalide (20 mg/kg
by i.p. injection) 1 h before nmda infusion lowered basal
choline efflux only slightly (by 7%) but fully antagonized
the nmda-induced increase of choline release (fig. 4a).
the convulsive effect of nmda was almost completely
suppressed by bilobalide pretreatment (fig. 4b).

the present study introduces a neurochemical method for
the assessment of nmda receptor activation. this method
is based on the observation that the release of choline from
superfused rat hippocampal slices was strictly related to
the stimulation of nmda receptors. release of choline
could be evoked by glutamate or by nmda; glutamate as
agonist required higher concentrations than nmda, probably because of the efficient uptake of glutamate by astrocytes in the slice preparation. it is unlikely, however, that
glial cells contribute to the nmda-induced effects, because glial cells do not express a significant number of
nmda receptors and also did not contribute to nmdainduced  xxxd208xxx  release in a previous study (sanfeliu
et al. 1990). nmda-induced depolarization per se was not
sufficient for choline release to occur because the effect
was not mimicked by kcl or  xxxd1804xxx .
the involvement of nmda receptors was proven by
the observations that the response to nmda was blocked
by magnesium, was dependent on calcium and was inhibited by two well-characterized antagonists at the nmda
receptor, the channel blocker mk-801 (dizolcipine) and
the glycine site antagonist, 7-chlorokynurenate (cka;
fig. 1). it should be noted that the effects of the glutamatergic agonists were only slightly increased when
glycine was added to the perfusion medium; this finding
is in agreement with previous studies and demonstrates
that the slices release sufficient amounts of glycine to saturate the high-affinity glycine binding site at the nmda
receptor (danysz and parsons 1998). preliminary data
from our laboratory indicate that the effects of cka, but
not those of mk-801, are blocked in the presence of
glycine (weichel and klein, unpublished observations);
thus, the present method may be useful for screening putative nmda receptor antagonists acting at the glycine
site.
the biological endpoint of the present method for assessing nmda receptor activation is the release of free
choline which can be measured in a rapid and sensitive
manner by luminometry. this free choline stems from
 xxxg1760xxx -mediated breakdown of phosphatidylcholine (pc)
as evidenced by the nmda-induced formation of lyso-pc
and gpch (fig. 3). lyso-pc is the primary product of  xxxg1760xxx 
enzymatic activity and could, in principle, be re-acylated
to pc; however, the formation of gpch indicates that
lyso-pc is cleaved by  xxxg1763xxx . the formation
of gpch is unequivocal proof of phospholipase a activation because pla-induced breakdown of pc is the only
biochemical pathway which results in gpch formation.
cytoplasmic calcium-dependent  xxxg1760xxx  ( xxxg1228xxx   xxxg1763xxx ) is likely
involved in pc breakdown because, first, nmda-evoked
choline release was dependent on extracellular calcium
(fig. 1b) and, second, was suppressed by an inhibitor of
 xxxg1228xxx   xxxg1763xxx  (fig. 3c). given a brain tissue level of approxi-

614

mately 6 nmol gpch per mg protein (klein et al. 1993),
the strong increase in gpch observed after nmda application (fig. 3b) is compatible with the release of choline
from the slices which amounts to 1–2 nmol/mg protein
within 30 min; however, an exact calculation cannot be
performed because the gpch tissue levels were determined by radioactive labelling, and the pool size of the labelled pc is unknown. it may be added that acetylcholine
as a source for choline could be excluded, first, because
acetylcholinesterase was inhibited by dfp and, second,
because the magnitude of choline release exceeded the tissue contents not only of choline but also of acetylcholine
(klein et al. 1993). an activation of phospholipase d
(pld) by nmda (klein et al. 1998) did not occur under
the present conditions. glutamatergic activation of pld is
high in slices from young rats (3–14 days) but decreases
dramatically with aging (klein et al. 1998); therefore,
slices from adult rats were used in the present study.
in conclusion, the glutamate-induced release of choline
observed in the present study was mediated by nmda receptor activation, leading to calcium influx, activation of
neuronal  xxxg1760xxx  and pc breakdown as shown by the sequential formation of lyso-pc, gpch and free choline.
the same reaction cascade probably caused the formation
of choline in vivo, after infusion of nmda into the hippocampus (fig. 4); a similar observation of nmda-induced and calcium-dependent choline release was recently reported by zapata et al. (1998). measuring the release of choline from hippocampal slices is a novel neurochemical method to assess nmda receptor function and
may be useful for rapid drug characterization in laboratories devoid of electrophysiological equipment.

the exact site of action of bilobalide remains unknown; however, our results demonstrate that bilobalide
acts downstream of glutamate release and nmda receptor activation and upstream of  xxxg1760xxx  activation. preliminary evidence from our laboratory indicates that bilobalide may interact with glycinergic responses. the micromolar potency of bilobalide observed in the present study
is compatible with a possible therapeutic efficiency of the
compound in vivo. in rats, the administration of the clinically used ginkgo extract, egb 761 (50–100 mg/kg p.o.),
which contains 2.9% bilobalide, led to plasma concentrations of bilobalide of 0.3–0.8 µm (defeudis 1998). a recent clinical study demonstrated a high oral bioavailability for bilobalide (>80%) in humans (fourtillan et al.
1995). bilobalide given systemically to rats (20 mg/kg
i.p.) was active against hypoxia-induced choline release in
an ex vivo experiment (klein et al. 1997), indicating penetration of the blood-brain barrier. in the present study,
bilobalide, given systemically, evidently reached a sufficient concentration in the brain to suppress the convulsive
effect of hippocampal nmda infusions (fig. 4b). possible therapeutic indications for bilobalide, therefore, include not only neurodegenerative, but also convulsive disorders as nmda-induced hippocampal seizures may
mimic some features of drug-resistant epilepsy in humans
(löscher 1997).
in conclusion, our results demonstrate that bilobalide,
a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from ginkgo leaves, potently inhibits the nmda-induced,  xxxg1760xxx -dependent release of choline from hippocampal phospholipids both in
vitro and in vivo. this effect likely contributes to the apparent therapeutic potential of  xxxd2199xxx  extracts in
neurodegenerative disorders (le bars et al. 1997; defeudis 1998).

is one of the major mechanisms of acute and chronic neurodegeneration (bazan et al. 1995; farooqui et al. 1997).
 xxxg1760xxx  activity causes phospholipid breakdown and the
formation of biologically active metabolites including
lyso-pc, paf, and free  xxxd2154xxx ; the calcium dependency of this response, as well as recent studies in knockout mice, implicate  xxxg1228xxx   xxxg1763xxx  in excitotoxic membrane damage (bonventre et al. 1997). the present study demonstrates that bilobalide disrupts nmda-induced breakdown of neuronal membrane phospholipids with a potency in the low micromolar range. in fact, bilobalide
completely suppressed the nmda-induced release of
choline both in vitro (10–100 µm; fig. 2) and in vivo (20
mg/kg; fig. 4) while basal choline levels were not significantly affected. in addition, bilobalide (10 µm) fully inhibited the increases of lyso-pc and gpch which were
evoked by nmda (fig. 3). the disruption of the nmda
receptor ⇒ calcium influx ⇒  xxxg1759xxx  cascade
by bilobalide likely explains previous reports on antihypoxic (klein et al. 1997) and anti-apoptotic (ahlemeyer et
al. 1999) actions of bilobalide.
