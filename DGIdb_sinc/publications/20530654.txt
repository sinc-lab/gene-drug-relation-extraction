introduction
the  xxxg1080xxx  ( xxxg1080xxx ) initially was characterized as an autoreceptor regulating histamine release in brain
(arrang et al., 1983). its coupling to gi/o proteins was confirmed by its cloning in human (lovenberg et al., 1999).
activation of recombinant h3rs inhibits adenylate cyclase
(lovenberg et al., 1999) and activates  xxxg1759xxx 
(morisset et al., 2000a). in different species, including human, various functional isoforms are generated by deletion of
a pseudo-intron, variable in length and located in the third
intracellular loop of the  xxxg1080xxx  (hancock et al., 2003).
recombinant h3rs exhibit high constitutive activity, and
most antagonists act in fact as inverse agonists on various
responses (arrang et al., 2007). prototypic antagonists themthis study was supported by institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale, the fondation pour la recherche médicale, and the direction des

tamine (t-meha) levels in the brains of mice. its acute intraperitoneal administration increased t-meha levels with an ed50 of
0.4 mg/kg, indicating inverse agonism. at higher doses, tmeha levels gradually returned to basal levels, a profile probably
resulting from agonism. after acute oral administration,  xxxd321xxx  increased t-meha levels with an ed50 of 2 mg/kg, a rightward
shift probably caused by almost complete first-pass metabolism.
in each case, the maximal effect of  xxxd321xxx  was lower than that
of ciproxifan, indicating partial inverse agonism. after an oral
8-day treatment, the only effective dose of  xxxd321xxx  was 30
mg/kg, indicating that a tolerance had developed. these data
strongly suggest that therapeutic effects of  xxxd321xxx  result from
an enhancement of histamine neuron activity induced by inverse
agonism at h3 autoreceptors.

selves, such as thioperamide or ciproxifan (cpx), act as inverse agonists and abrogate constitutive activity (morisset et
al., 2000a). moreover, constitutive activity of the recombinant  xxxg1080xxx  depends on species, isoforms, cell lines, and signaling pathways (arrang et al., 2007), but all of the data are
consistent with high constitutive activity of the rat  xxxg1080xxx 
(rh3r) and human  xxxg1080xxx  ( xxxg1080xxx ).
consistent with the physiological relevance of the phenomenon, we demonstrated high constitutive activity of native
h3rs in rodent brain in vitro (morisset et al., 2000a; rouleau
et al., 2002). moreover, in vivo,  xxxg1080xxx -inverse agonists enhance
tele-methylhistamine (t-meha) levels, a reliable index of histamine neuron activity, by abrogating the brake triggered by
constitutive activity of h3 autoreceptors (morisset et al.,
2000a; gbahou et al., 2003). the recombinant human h3rs
expressed at moderate densities also display constitutive activity, suggesting it is present in human brain (rouleau et
al., 2002).

abstract
we previously suggested that therapeutic effects of  xxxd321xxx 
in vestibular disorders result from its antagonist properties at
histamine h3 receptors (h3rs). however, h3rs exhibit constitutive activity, and most  xxxg1080xxx  antagonists act as inverse agonists. here, we have investigated the effects of  xxxd321xxx  at
recombinant  xxxg1080xxx  isoforms. on inhibition of camp formation
and [3h] xxxd208xxx  release,  xxxd321xxx  behaved as a
nanomolar  xxxd1422xxx  and a micromolar agonist. both
effects were suppressed by pertussis toxin, were found at all
isoforms tested, and were not detected in mock cells, confirming interactions at h3rs. the  xxxd1422xxx  potency of  xxxd321xxx  and its affinity on [125i]iodoproxyfan binding were similar
in rat and human. we then investigated the effects of  xxxd321xxx  on histamine neuron activity by measuring tele-methylhis-

stable transfection of cho-k1 cells. the clones used in this
study were obtained as described previously (rouleau et al., 2002).
cdna inserts corresponding to the full-length coding sequences of
the rh3r and  xxxg1080xxx  isoforms were ligated into the mammalian
expression vector pcineo (promega, charbonnières, france).
cho-k1 cells were transfected by using superfect (qiagen s.a.,
courtaboeuf, france). stable transfectants were selected with 2
mg/ml  xxxd2191xxx  ( xxxg418xxx ) (invitrogen, cergy-pontoise, france), and
their expression level was tested for [125i]iodoproxyfan binding, a
selective  xxxg1080xxx  radioligand (ligneau et al., 1994). several clones,
cho(rh3(445)r), cho(rh3(413)r), and cho(hh3(445)r), expressing
receptor densities from 200 to 700 fmol/mg protein were selected for
further characterization and maintained in presence of 1 mg/ml
 xxxg418xxx .
[125i]iodoproxyfan binding assay. cho(rh3(445)r), cho
(rh3(413)r), and cho(hh3(445)r) cells were washed and homogenized with a polytron homogenizer in ice-cold binding buffer (50

mm na2hpo4/kh2po4, ph 7.5). after centrifugation (12,000g for
30 min at 4°c), the pellet was suspended in 1 ml of ice-cold binding
buffer, and assays were performed as described previously
(ligneau et al., 1994). aliquots of membrane suspension (⬃20 ␮g
of protein) were incubated for 60 min at 25°c with 20 pm [125i]iodoproxyfan alone (total binding) or together with  xxxd321xxx  at
increasing concentrations (200 ␮l, final volume). the nonspecific
binding was determined in the presence of the selective  xxxg1080xxx 
agonist imetit (1 ␮m). the specific binding was calculated from
the difference between the total binding and nonspecific binding
and represented ⬃80% of the total binding.
camp formation. cho(rh3(445)r), cho(rh3(413)r), and cho
(hh3(445)r) cells expressing 200 to 700 fmol/mg protein were incubated in 96-well plates for 10 min at 37°c with 3 ␮m  xxxd1742xxx  (fsk),
the adenylate cyclase activator, and when required,  xxxd321xxx  at
increasing concentrations in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s mediumnut mix f-12 (invitrogen) containing 100 ␮m isobutyl-methyl-xanthine. the effects of  xxxd321xxx  were compared with those of histamine (10 ␮m), the natural agonist, and thioperamide (10 ␮m), a
potent and selective  xxxd1422xxx  (morisset et al., 2000a). camp
was extracted and measured by radioimmunoassay.
[3h] xxxd208xxx  release. cho(rh3(445)r), cho(rh3(413)r),
and cho(hh3(445)r) cells expressing 200 to 700 fmol/mg protein were
incubated for 2 h at 37°c with 0.5 ␮ci of [3h] xxxd208xxx  in dulbecco’s
modified eagle’s medium-nut mix f-12 containing 0.2% bovine serum
albumin. after washings, cells were incubated for 30 min with 2 ␮m ca2⫹
ionophore a23187 [5-methylamino-2-(2s,3r,5r,8s,9s)-3,5,9-trimethyl-2(1-oxo-(1h-pyrrol-2-yl)propan-2-yl)-1,7-dioxaspiro-(5,5)undecan-8-yl)methyl)benzooxazole-4-carboxylic acid] and, when required,  xxxd321xxx  at increasing concentrations, histamine, or thioperamide (10 ␮m). [3h] xxxd208xxx  release was determined by liquid scintillation counting.
determination of tele-methylhistamine levels in brain.
drugs were dissolved in 1%  xxxd2609xxx  or saline solution [0.9%
(w/v) nacl] for oral and intraperitoneal administration, respectively,
to male swiss mice (18 –20g) (iffa-credo, l’arbresle, france). after
treatment, animals were sacrificed by decapitation. the total brain
was dissected out and homogenized in 10 volumes (w/v) of ice-cold
perchloric acid (0.4 n). the clear supernatant was stored at ⫺20°c
immediately after centrifugation (4,000g for 20 min). t-meha levels
were determined by using an enzyme immunoassay derived from a
radioimmunoassay described previously (garbarg et al., 1989a,
1992). in brief, t-meha of the sample was derivatized with  xxxd309xxx  ( xxxd312xxx ) (2.8 mg/ml). the reaction was allowed to proceed at
ph 7.9 for 3 h, then 2 m glycine was added to eliminate the excess of
 xxxd312xxx . the derivatized extract was mixed with t-meha- xxxd312xxx -leu-tyracetylcholinesterase as a tracer and an antiserum raised in rabbits
against t-meha conjugated with bovine  xxxg124xxx  via  xxxd309xxx  in a plate (nunc immuno-plate maxi-sorp surface; nunc
a/s, roskilde, denmark) pretreated with swine anti-rabbit igg (cayman chemical, ann arbor, mi). after incubation for 16 h at 15°c,
plates were washed, and the substrate for acetylcholinesterase, the
ellmann’s reagent, was added. after 5 h, the optical density was
measured with a dynatech mr5000 (dynex technologies, chantilly,
va) at 405 nm. the limit of the detection was 5 pg of t-meha.
analysis of data. in binding experiments, ic50 values of  xxxd321xxx  were determined with an iterative least-squares method derived from that of parker and waud (1971). the apparent affinity
constants (ki values) of  xxxd321xxx  were calculated from its ic50
values, assuming a competitive antagonism and by using the relationship (cheng and prussoff, 1973) ki ⫽ ic50/1 ⫹ (s/kd), where s
represents the concentration (20 pm) and kd is the apparent dissociation constant of [125i]iodoproxyfan at the rh3(445)r (85 ⫾ 4 pm)
and hh3(445)r (82 ⫾ 3 pm).
in functional assays, ec50 values of  xxxd321xxx  corresponding to
stimulatory and inhibitory phases of its biphasic effects were evaluated by nonlinear regression with prism software (graphpad
software, inc., san diego, ca). the following equation was fitted

orders such as meniere’s disease (canty and valentine, 1981;
oosterveld, 1984). however, the molecular mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effects remain unclear, inasmuch as
its first metabolite may also display some activity (fossati et
al., 2001). we have reported previously in the rat that  xxxd321xxx  behaves as a  xxxg1080xxx  antagonist with moderate potency
at autoreceptors modulating histamine release in vitro (arrang et al., 1985), and we suggested that this property, coupled to moderate  xxxg1078xxx  agonist activity, might account
for the beneficial effects of the compound in the treatment of
vertigo. in agreement, the systemic administration of thioperamide results in a strong vestibuloplegic effect and strongly
depresses the horizontal vestibular-ocular reflex gain (yabe et
al., 1993). it also accelerates the recovery of behavioral functions in the cat after unilateral vestibular neurectomy
(tighilet et al., 2006, 2007).
the antagonist property of  xxxd321xxx  that we initially
reported at h3 autoreceptors (arrang et al., 1985) was established on histamine release induced by a low stimulus, that
is, when the h3 autoreceptor displayed no apparent constitutive activity (morisset et al., 2000a). however, the improvement of vestibular compensation induced in the cat by  xxxd321xxx  was accompanied by an enhancement of histidine
decarboxylase mrna expression in histamine perikarya
(tighilet et al., 2007), thereby suggesting that  xxxd321xxx 
was in fact acting as an  xxxg1080xxx   xxxd1422xxx .
in the present study, we first investigated the in vitro
activity of  xxxd321xxx  at recombinant rh3(413)r and
rh3(445)r isoforms mediating inhibition of camp formation
and [3h] xxxd208xxx  release in cho cells. the  xxxg1080xxx 
displays constitutive activity on these two functional responses (morisset et al., 2000a; rouleau et al., 2002); therefore, the whole spectrum of drug activity, ranging from agonism to inverse agonism, can be explored. in addition,
because h3rs show important species-related pharmacological differences (leurs et al., 2005), and  xxxd321xxx  had not
yet been studied at human h3rs, we compared the profiles of
 xxxd321xxx  at recombinant human and rat h3(445)rs in the
same tests. we have investigated the in vivo activity of  xxxd321xxx  on histamine neuron activity, by measuring
t-meha levels, a reliable index of this activity, in the brains
of mice after acute intraperitoneal administration and acute
or repeated oral administration.

results
effect of  xxxd321xxx  on [125i]iodoproxyfan binding
to rat and human  xxxg1080xxx  isoforms. computer analysis by
nonlinear regression using a one-site cooperative model
showed that  xxxd321xxx  inhibited [125i]iodoproxyfan binding

to membranes of cho(rh3(445)r) and cho(hh3(445)r) cells
with pseudo-hill coefficients not significantly different from
unity. ic50 values of 1.9 ⫾ 0.2 and 3.3 ⫾ 0.4 ␮m, respectively,
led to ki values of  xxxd321xxx  of 1.4 ⫾ 0.1 ␮m at the rh3(445)r
and 2.5 ⫾ 0.3 ␮m at the hh3(445)r (fig. 1; table 1).  xxxd321xxx  inhibited the binding of [125i]iodoproxyfan to membranes of cho(rh3(413)r) cells with a pseudo-hill coefficient
of 0.5 ⫾ 0.1 and a mean ic50 value of 9 ⫾ 2 ␮m (fig. 1; table
1). the data fitted significantly better to a two-site model
analysis and could be resolved in a high-affinity site with an
ic50 value of 0.9 ⫾ 0.3 nm and a low-affinity site with an ic50
value of 77 ⫾ 42 ␮m.
functional properties of  xxxd321xxx  at rat  xxxg1080xxx  isoforms. in agreement with the  xxxg1080xxx -mediated inhibition of
adenylyl cyclase, histamine used as an agonist significantly
inhibited camp formation induced by 3 ␮m fsk in
cho(rh3(445)r) cells, with an ec50 value of 9 ⫾ 2 nm (not
shown) and a maximal effect reached at 1 to 10 ␮m of ⫺20 ⫾
2% (n ⫽ 9 experiments). in contrast, the reference inverse
agonist thioperamide (10 ␮m) enhanced fsk-induced-camp
accumulation in cho(rh3(445)r) cells (⫹35 ⫾ 8%; n ⫽ 7
experiments), revealing the constitutive activity of the rat
h3(445)r isoform (fig. 2).
increasing concentrations of  xxxd321xxx  promoted a biphasic dose–response curve in cho(rh3(445)r) cells. when added
at low concentrations,  xxxd321xxx  mimicked the effect of
thioperamide, thereby behaving as an apparent  xxxd1422xxx , and progressively enhanced camp formation (ec50 ⫽
0.1 ⫾ 0.1 nm) with a maximal effect, observed up to 10 nm,
similar to that of thioperamide (⫹32 ⫾ 7% versus ⫹ 35 ⫾ 8%;
p ⬍ 0.001 compared with fsk alone). in contrast, at concentrations higher than 10 nm  xxxd321xxx  progressively inhibited camp formation with an ec50 value of 0.1 ⫾ 0.1 ␮m and
full agonist activity, its maximal effect being similar to that
of histamine (⫺21 ⫾ 3% versus ⫺20 ⫾ 2%; p ⬍ 0.001 versus
fsk alone) (fig. 2, a and b; table 1). this agonist effect was
entirely blocked by 10 ␮m thioperamide (4.5 ⫾ 0.2 pmol
camp versus 9.5 ⫾ 0.8 pmol camp, respectively; p ⬍ 0.001).
in agreement with the  xxxg1080xxx -mediated activation of  xxxg1759xxx , histamine used as an agonist at a maximal
concentration (10 ␮m) strongly enhanced [3h]arachidonic
acid release evoked by the ca2⫹ ionophore a23187 from
cho(rh3(445)r) cells (⫹48 ⫾ 6%; n ⫽ 19 experiments). as
already observed in rat (morisset et al., 2000a; gbahou et al.,
2003), its ec50 value on this response was higher than on
camp formation (141 ⫾ 39 nm versus 9 ⫾ 2 nm; not shown).
in contrast, the  xxxd1422xxx  thioperamide (10 ␮m) decreased significantly a23187-evoked [3h] xxxd208xxx  release (⫺44 ⫾ 4%; n ⫽ 22 experiments), revealing constitutive
activity of the rat h3(445)r isoform in this test system. a

biphasic response was observed at the rat h3(445)r in the
presence of increasing concentrations of  xxxd321xxx . at low
concentrations,  xxxd321xxx  progressively reduced a23187evoked [3h] xxxd208xxx  release (ec50 ⫽ 0.1 ⫾ 0.1 nm)
with a maximal effect, observed up to 30 nm, similar to that
of thioperamide (⫺47 ⫾ 5 and ⫺44 ⫾ 4%, respectively; p ⬍
0.001 versus a23187 alone). at concentrations higher than
30 nm,  xxxd321xxx  progressively enhanced the release with
an ec50 value of 7 ⫾ 1 ␮m and full agonist activity, its
maximal effect being similar to that of histamine (⫹41 ⫾ 11%
versus ⫹48 ⫾ 6%; p ⬍ 0.01 versus a23187 alone) (fig. 2, c
and d; table 1). at this rat isoform,  xxxd321xxx  therefore had
the same  xxxd1422xxx  potency on camp formation and
[3h] xxxd208xxx  release (ec50 of 0.1 ⫾ 0.1 and 0.1 ⫾ 0.1
nm, respectively), whereas its agonist potency, like that of
histamine, was lower on [3h] xxxd208xxx  release (ec50
of 7 ⫾ 1 ␮m versus 0.1 ⫾ 0.1 ␮m; table 1).
in cho cells expressing the short rat h3(413)r isoform, the
same biphasic patterns were observed, both on camp accumulation and [3h] xxxd208xxx  release (fig. 3). betahis-

tine increased in a dose-dependent manner the concentration
of camp accumulation (ec50 ⫽ 0.05 ⫾ 0.15 nm) to reach a
maximal effect, observed up to 1 nm, similar to that of thioperamide (⫹17 ⫾ 4% versus ⫹ 22 ⫾ 2%,;p ⬍ 0.05 versus fsk
alone) (fig. 3, a and b; table 1). at concentrations higher
than 1 nm  xxxd321xxx  behaved as histamine and inhibited
camp accumulation by 73% at the highest concentration
tested (300 ␮m). an ec50 value ⱖ15 ⫾ 1 ␮m was obtained for
 xxxd321xxx  acting as an agonist at cho(rh3(413)r) cells,
assuming that the drug was acting as a full agonist (table 1).
this agonist effect was again entirely blocked by 10 ␮m
thioperamide (3.9 ⫾ 0.7 pmol camp versus 11.9 ⫾ 1.2 pmol
camp, respectively; p ⬍ 0.001).
on [3h] xxxd208xxx  release from cho(rh3(413)r) cells
 xxxd321xxx  displayed a similar biphasic effect. it behaved as
a full  xxxd1422xxx  up to 3 nm (⫺16 ⫾ 5% versus ⫺20 ⫾ 2%
for thioperamide; p ⬍ 0.05 versus a23187 alone). its agonist
effect reached a plateau corresponding to 51% of the maximal
effect of histamine at 100 ␮m, suggesting that  xxxd321xxx 
was acting as a partial agonist (fig. 3, c and d). ec50 values

as an  xxxd1422xxx  (ec50 of 0.05 ⫾ 0.15 and 0.06 ⫾ 0.23

camp formation with an amplitude (⫹22%) similar to that
observed when it was used alone (fig. 5a).

discussion
at recombinant h3rs  xxxd321xxx  behaved not only as a
potent  xxxd1422xxx , but also as an agonist at higher concentrations. these  xxxd1422xxx  and agonist effects both
were mediated by h3rs. they were found on a negatively

(camp accumulation) and positively ([3h] xxxd208xxx 
release) coupled response. they were not detected in mock
cells, but both were found in all rat and human isoforms.
they were both suppressed by ptx, in agreement with coupling of h3rs to gi/o proteins. this wide spectrum of activity
did not result from protean agonism (kenakin, 1995), because, in contrast to proxyfan (gbahou et al., 2003), it occurred at the same level of constitutive activity. it did not
result from a switch in coupling from gi to gs proteins, such
as that reported with agonists at muscarinic receptors
(michal et al., 2001), because opposite effects of  xxxd321xxx 
would have been observed. moreover, their ptx sensitivity
shows that the two responses are mediated by gi/go proteins.
further studies are required to know which gi/go proteins
are involved, inasmuch as the hh3(445)r couples similarly to
different g␣i/o subunits (schnell et al., 2010).
the multistate model of g protein-coupled receptors
(kenakin, 1995; gbahou et al., 2003; arrang et al., 2007)
more likely accounts for these biphasic effects.  xxxd321xxx 
would first stabilize inactive conformations, thereby inducing
inverse agonism. at higher concentrations,  xxxd321xxx  would

stabilize an active conformation antagonized by thioperamide. to our knowledge,  xxxd321xxx  is so far the first  xxxg1080xxx 
ligand inducing such biphasic effects, which suggests some
ligand selectivity. conformations selective for a given agonist, and with preferential coupling properties, have been
suggested for various g protein-coupled receptors (kenakin,
2001). although their existence remains controversial for the
 xxxg1080xxx  (krueger et al., 2005; schnell et al., 2010), a selective
 xxxd321xxx -directed state would account for the trafficking
from inverse agonism to agonism. it may also account for the
large variations of agonist potencies of  xxxd321xxx  at rat
isoforms: the preferential negative coupling of the long isoform to adenylate cyclase induced by histamine and  xxxd321xxx , was maintained for histamine, but not for  xxxd321xxx ,
at the short isoform.
the  xxxd1422xxx  potency of  xxxd321xxx  was surprisingly high, compared with its affinity on [125i]iodoproxyfan
binding. however,  xxxd1422xxx  radioligands label a much
larger population of h3rs than agonist radioligands such as
[125i]iodoproxyfan (witte et al., 2006; yao et al., 2006; mezzomo et al., 2007). therefore, inactive conformations with
high affinity for  xxxd321xxx  are not expected to be labeled by
[125i]iodoproxyfan. nevertheless,  xxxd321xxx  displaced
[125i]iodoproxyfan binding to the short rh3(413)r isoform with
a hill coefficient lower than unity. although we did not
analyze the effect of gtp on this shallow inhibition curve, it
may reflect binding of  xxxd321xxx  to both uncoupled and
coupled agonist states of this short isoform (arrang et al.,
1990). moreover, the mean ic50 of  xxxd321xxx  at this

rh3(413)r isoform was higher than its ki at the rh3(445)r
isoform (table 1), but very similar to its ki at rat autoreceptors (arrang et al., 1985), suggesting that the function of
autoreceptor is fulfilled by short, rather than long,  xxxg1080xxx  isoforms.
in contrast to other antagonists/inverse agonists (leurs et
al., 2005), the  xxxd1422xxx  potency and binding affinity of
 xxxd321xxx  were similar in rat and human. however, its
agonist potencies on inhibition of camp formation and
[3h] xxxd208xxx  release were lower at the human  xxxg1080xxx 
(table 1). so far,  xxxd321xxx  is the first agonist to discriminate the human and rat receptors (wulff et al., 2002). in
addition, the preferential negative coupling to adenylate cyclase induced in rat by  xxxd321xxx  was no longer observed in
human. its binding affinity remaining unchanged at the two
h3rs. the  xxxd321xxx  selective state discussed above may
promote a differential coupling not only of different isoforms
from a given species, but also of a given isoform from different species.
consistent with its  xxxd1422xxx  potency, a single intraperitoneal administration of  xxxd321xxx  increased t-meha
levels. however, its maximal effect was lower than that of
ciproxifan, indicating partial inverse agonism. at higher
doses, t-meha levels returned to basal levels, yielding a
bell-shaped curve reminiscent of biphasic curves in vitro.
this suggests that  xxxg1080xxx  agonism progressively reversed inverse agonism in vivo. it is noteworthy that  xxxd321xxx  also
acted as an agonist to increase cochlear blood flow in the
guinea pig (laurikainen et al., 1998). the contribution of h1
receptors activated by  xxxd321xxx  to this bell-shaped curve
can be excluded, because they are postsynaptic and do not
regulate histamine neuron activity (garbarg et al., 1989b).
in contrast to ciproxifan, the profile of  xxxd321xxx  on histamine neuron activity became different when it was given
orally. it acted only as a partial  xxxd1422xxx  and at doses
⬃10 times higher. this rightward shift probably is caused by
the rapid metabolism of  xxxd321xxx  in the liver after oral
administration. very low plasma concentrations were found
after its oral administration to human volunteers, indicating
that it undergoes almost complete first-pass metabolism
(chen et al., 2003). the rightward shift of its ed50 shows that
only 10% of the initial dose remains in tissues 90 min later,
explaining that agonism does not occur in such conditions,
even at the highest doses.
as expected (morisset et al., 2000b), repeated administration of ciproxifan induced a tolerance, its effect at 3 mg/kg

effects of  xxxd321xxx  at histamine h3 receptors

in conclusion,  xxxd321xxx  interacts in vitro with h3rs as a
potent  xxxd1422xxx , a moderate antagonist (arrang et al.,
1985), and a weak agonist. it acts in vivo as a partial inverse
agonist to enhance histamine neuron activity, an effect probably involved in therapeutics. therefore, although h3 heteroreceptors present on other neurons regulating vestibular
functions may also be involved (lozada et al., 2004; chavez
et al., 2005; bergquist et al., 2006), this study strongly suggests that h3 autoreceptors regulating histamine neurons in
human brain constitute a major target under  xxxd321xxx 
treatment.

being reduced by half after 8-day oral administration. after 8
days, the increase induced by oral administration of  xxxd321xxx  was only found at the high dose of 30 mg/kg, suggesting
either that a tolerance had developed for  xxxd321xxx  as an
 xxxd1422xxx  or that  xxxd321xxx  at such a high dose was
acting as an agonist. theoretically, repeated administration
of an agonist may desensitize autoreceptors, relieve the
brake, and lead to an enhancement of t-meha levels. (r)-␣methylhistamine itself induced a desensitization, because its
repeated administration failed to decrease histamine neuron
activity. however, it also failed to enhance t-meha levels,
confirming that the increase induced by repeated administration of  xxxd321xxx  at 30 mg/kg was not caused by desensitization of autoreceptors by its agonist effect. therefore,
metabolism and tolerance made a high dose necessary to
induce inverse agonism after repeated oral administration of
 xxxd321xxx .
overall, our data show that  xxxd321xxx  acts as an inverse
agonist to increase histamine neuron activity. in agreement,
tighilet et al. (2002, 2005) reported that  xxxd321xxx  given
orally to cats increased  xxxg1040xxx  mrna expression in the tuberomammilllary nucleus. moreover, in
mice (the present study) and cats, the increase in histamine
neuron activity was observed after a 1- to 3-week treatment,
i.e., when lesioned animals treated by  xxxd321xxx  recover
their vestibular functions (tighilet et al., 2007).
the present study confirms that human h3rs display constitutive activity (rouleau et al., 2002). however, whether
inverse agonism and enhancement of histamine neuron activity
account, even partially, for the therapeutic effects of  xxxd321xxx 
requires further investigations, including positron emission tomography studies. after 1-week oral administration, the effective doses of  xxxd321xxx  in mice were higher than the therapeutic dose (2 mg/kg) given, generally twice a day, to
vestibular-defective patients. however, the dose–response
curve of  xxxd321xxx  on histamine neuron activity in lesioned
animals is unknown. its ed50 may be lower than in controls,
because imbalanced vestibular activity itself activates histamine neurons (tighilet et al., 2006, 2007) and the effect of the
drug may synergize with this compensatory activation. moreover, in clinical practice, this therapeutic dose of 2 mg/kg is
given for several months. in agreement with our findings,
tighilet et al. (2006, 2007) reported that this dose had no
effect on  xxxg1040xxx  mrna expression in control
cats after a 1- or 3-week treatment. however, the same low
dose acquired an enhancing effect after 3 months (tighilet et
al., 2005). this suggests either that  xxxd321xxx  progressively
accumulates into the brain or simply that a low dose given
over a long period of time yields the therapeutic effect. its
activation of histamine neurons indicates that  xxxd321xxx 
enters the rodent brain after systemic administration, even
though its effective doses in vivo are rather high compared
with its subnanomolar  xxxd1422xxx  potency in vitro. in
addition, the effect of  xxxd321xxx  may be enhanced and prolonged in time by its first metabolite [(2–2-aminoethyl)-pyridine], which has the same affinity at rodent  xxxg1080xxx  binding
sites (fossati et al., 2001). although we did not investigate
the functional properties of this metabolite, it should be
emphasized that its presence, presumably predominant after
oral and repeated administration, renders even more complex the interpretation of in vivo and therapeutic effects of
 xxxd321xxx .
