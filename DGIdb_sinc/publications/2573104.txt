abstract. using positron emission tomography and the selective ligands t 1c-sch23390 and *~c-raclopride, central
d1- and d2-dopamine receptor occupancy was determined
in schizophrenic patients treated with clinical doses of classical and atypical neuroleptics. treatment with ten chemically distinct classical neuroleptics resulted in a 65-89%
occupancy of d2-dopamine receptors. this finding represents strong support for the hypothesis that the mechanism
of action of antipsychotic drugs is indeed related to a substantial degree of d2-dopamine receptor occupancy. in two
patients treated with the atypical neuroleptic clozapine,
300 mg b.i.d, and 150 mg b.i.d., the d2-dopamine receptor
occupancy was 65 and 40%, respectively. dl-dopamine receptor occupancy was determined in six antipsychotic drugtreated patients. no dl-dopamine receptor occupancy was
found in patients treated with sulpiride and perphenazine,
compounds known to be selective d2-dopamine receptor
antagonists. the highest dl-dopamine receptor occupancy,
42%, was found in the patient treated with clozapine
150 mg b.i.d. the effects of the atypical neuroleptic clozapine may be related to a combined effect on both d1- and
d2-dopamine receptors.

it is widely accepted that the therapeutic effect of neuroleptic drugs is related to their ability to antagonize the
action of the neurotransmitter dopamine (carlsson 1978).
this hypothesis is supported by the demonstration of a
linear correlation between drug affinity for central d2-dopamine receptors in animals and antipsychotic potency in
man (creese et al. 1976; seeman et al. 1976). no such correlation has been demonstrated for any other central receptor
(peroutka and snyder 1980).
previously it has not been possible to examine central

dopamine receptor binding during antipsychotic drug treatment in man. the development of positron emission tomography (pet) has now made it feasible to study radioligand binding to receptors in the living human brain
(wagner et al. 1983; sedvall et al. 1986). after intravenous
injection of a radioligand, the pet camera system measures
regional brain radioactivity as a function of time.
raclopride is a highly selective d2-dopamine receptor
antagonist (k6hler et al. 1985). the compound has been
labelled with the positron emitting isotope 11c and used
for pet examination of central d2-dopamine receptors in
man (farde et al. 1986). equilibrium is rapidly established
after ligand injection, allowing the determination of receptor density (bmax) and affinity (ka) by a saturation procedure. by varying the specific activity in series of experiments, bm,x and kd have been calculated from saturation
curves and scatchard plots. initial studies with clinical
doses of raclopride in schizophrenic patients indicate that
the receptor population examined with pet is a population
by which antipsychotic effect may be mediated (farde et al.
1988c).
although the dl-dopamine receptor was the first of
the subtypes to be defined with regard to the biochemical
effector system (kebabian and calne 1979), research on
dl-receptor characteristics has been limited because of the
previous lack of dl-selective compounds. sch23390 was
described by iorio et al. (1981) as a potential antipsychotic
with an atypical pharmacological profile. hyttel (1983) later
found that sch 23390 was a selective high affinity d1dopamine receptor antagonist. the effect of selective d1antagonists on schizophrenic patients has not yet been examined. sch 23390 has been labelled with **c (halldin
et al. 1986) and used to demonstrate dl-dopamine receptor
binding in the brain of healthy human subjects by pet
(farde et al. 1987b).
using **c-raclopride and pet we have previously determined central d2-dopamine receptor occupancy in patients treated with clinical doses of all the major chemical
classes of antipsychotics used today (farde et al. 1988a).
in the present study we have studied both d1- and d2dopamine receptor occupancy in an extended series of neuroleptic-treated patients.

patients. patients recruited for the study satisfied the criteria for a schizophrenic disorder according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (dsmiii,
3rd ed, 1982) and had been on continous antipsychotic drug
treatment for at least 1 month.
adverse effects. extrapyramidal side effects were registered
using a specific questionaire (farde et al. 1988c). in addition, akathisia was rated according to t. barnes rating scale
for drug-induced akathisia (barnes and braude 1985).
experimental procedure. the synthesis of the radioligand
and the procedure for the pet experiments are described
in detail elsewhere (halldin et al. 1986; farde et al. 1988b).
in summary, 11c_raclopride and hc-sch23390 were prepared by alkylation of the corresponding desmethyl analogue using 11c-methyliodide. in each experiment 100 mbq
of either radioligand was injected intravenously (specific
activity: 110-1200 ci/mmol). brain radioactivity was followed with a pc384b pet system (scanditronix, sweden)
by sequential scans for 51 min.
regional radioactivity was measured for each sequential
scan, corrected for ~1c-decay, and plotted versus time. specific d i - or d2-dopamine receptor binding in the putamen
(b) was defined as the difference between radioactivity in
the putamen, a region with a high density of d1- and d2dopamine receptors and the cerebellum, a region with negligible densities. radioactivity in cerebellum was used as an
estimate of the free radioligand concentration in the brain
(f). the concept dopamine receptor occupancy is defined
as the per cent reduction of the ratio b/f in relation to
the expected value in the neuroleptic-free state. the expected value b/f for d2-dopamine receptor binding was
based on experiments in 15 drug-naive schizophrenic patients (mean=3.55; sd=0.63) (farde etal. 1987a). the
expected value b/f for dl-dopamine receptor binding was
based on experiments in seven healthy subjects (mean = 2.9;
sd = 0.37) (farde et al. 1987b).

results

in each of the patients treated with 1 of 11 chemically distinct antipsychotic drugs there was a marked reduction of
radioactivity in the putamen when compared to the mean
value previously obtained in the drug-naive schizophrenic
patients (table 1). in patients treated with classical neuroleptics the d2-dopamine receptor occupancy varied between 65 and 89%. in two patients treated with the atypical
neuroleptic clozapine 150 mg b.i.d, and 300 mg b.i.d, the
d2-dopamine receptor occupancy was 40 and 65%, respectively, the lowest values so far obtained.
in some of the patients, akathisia and parkinsonism
were recorded in connection with the pet experiment (table 1). these patients with extrapyramidal side effects
tended to have higher d2-dopamine receptor occupancies
as compared to patients with no extrapyramidal side effects.
the dl-dopamine receptor occupancy was examined in
six patients (table 2). no occupancy was found in patients
treated with sulpiride and perphenazine. in patients treated

concept "atypical" refers to drugs that do not produce
catalepsy in animals and that have a low frequency of extrapyramidal side effects in man. clozapine is the prototype
for such drugs (loc cit). in the present study, the lowest
values for the d2-dopamine receptor occupancy were found
in patients treated with clozapine (table 1). the patient
with 40% d2-dopamine receptor occupancy also had the
highest dl-dopamine receptor occupancy so far determined, 42% (table 2). this finding of a similar degree of
d1- and d2-dopamine receptor occupancy is in agreement
with results from in vivo binding studies in rodents, where
clozapine has been reported to have equal affinity for the
di- and d2-dopamine receptor (andersson et al. 1986).
the mechanism underlying the atypical properties of clozapine may be related to an effect on both d1- and d2dopamine receptors.

discussion
in the present study pet was used to examine d2-dopamine receptor occupancy in psychiatric patients treated with
conventional doses of 11 chemically distinct antipsychotic
drugs. each of the classical antipsychotic drugs induced
a more than 65% occupancy of d2-dopamine receptors
in the putamen, the only central receptor that all classes
of antipsychotic drugs have been shown to have affinity
to in vitro. this common affinity is the basis for the dopamine hypothesis of the mechanism of action for the antipsychotic drugs (creese et al. 1976; seeman et al. 1976; carlsson 1978). the lack of appropriate methodology has previously precluded the evaluation of this hypothesis directly
in patients. our finding that clinical doses of all the 11
chemically distinct antipsychotic drugs induce a 65-85%
occupancy of the central d2-dopamine receptors represents
strong support for the hypothesis that the mechanism of
action of antipsychotic drugs is indeed related to a substantial degree of d2-dopamine receptor occupancy.
this study was not designed to examine prospectively
the detailed relationships between the degree of d2-dopamine receptor occupancy and drug effects. however, it is
of interest that the patients with extrapyramidal side effects
tended to have higher occupancies than the patients with
no extrapyramidal side effects. in future studies it may be
possible to define a threshold, in terms of d2-dopamine
receptor occupancy in the putamen, above which drug-induced extrapyramidal side effects can be expected.
antipsychotic drugs have been subdivided into classical
and atypical neuroleptics (stille and hippius 1971). the

pet group involved in the pet experiments is gratefully acknowledged. this research was supported by the karolinska instituter.
