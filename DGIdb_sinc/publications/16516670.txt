clinical experience with  xxxd1832xxx 
( xxxd1832xxx )

 xxxd1832xxx  ( xxxd1832xxx ; seragen inc, san diego, ca) is a fusion protein designed to
direct the cytocidal action of diphtheria toxin to cells that overexpress the  xxxg1175xxx . the
human  xxxg1175xxx  exists in three isoforms: low (cd25), intermediate ( xxxg1175xxx / xxxg1176xxx ),
and high (cd25/ xxxg1175xxx / xxxg1176xxx ) affinity. the high-affinity form of this receptor is expressed
on activated t lymphocytes, activated b lymphocytes, and activated macrophages. a
number of leukemias and lymphomas, including cutaneous t-cell lymphoma, chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, and b-cell non-hodgkin’s lymphoma, express a component of the
receptor. ex vivo studies have shown that  xxxd1832xxx  interacts with the high- and
intermediate-affinity  xxxg1175xxx  on the cell surface and undergoes internalization. subsequent cleavage in the endosome releases the diphtheria toxin into the cytosol, which
then inhibits cellular protein synthesis, resulting in rapid cell death. this article examines
the clinical profile and potential benefits of  xxxd1832xxx  in the treatment of cutaneous
t-cell lymphoma and other hematologic disorders.

utaneous t-cell lymphomas ( xxxg2343xxx ) are a heterogenous
group of disorders characterized by clonal accumulation
of malignant cd4⫹ or cd8⫹ t lymphocytes in the skin.1–3
treatments are generally tailored to the stage of  xxxg2343xxx , with
many patients progressing through the array of topical and
immunomodulatory therapies used initially. when patients
develop tumor stage disease or refractory patch/plaque disease, systemic therapy is initiated, often with single-agent
therapies such as methotrexate,  xxxg1137xxx , or  xxxd330xxx . when patients become refractory to these approaches,
cytotoxic agents and novel approaches are warranted.
unlike most resting t and b cells, adult malignant t and b
lymphocytes may express intermediate- or high-affinity interleukin-2 receptors ( xxxg1175xxx ). indeed, high- or intermediateaffinity  xxxg1175xxx  isoforms are expressed in at least 50% of  xxxg2343xxx 
and 25% to 50% of b-cell non-hodgkin’s lymphoma (nhl)
cases when tissue is examined by immunohistochemistry or
flow cytometry.4 such observations contribute to the scientific basis for therapies that target  xxxg1175xxx -expressing cells.4
 xxxg1175xxx  were first targeted using anti-cd25 (anti-tac) mono-

clonal antibodies on pha-activated normal lymphocytes.4 in
addition to increased  xxxg1175xxx  expression in  xxxg2343xxx  and nhl,
overexpression has also been reported in other hematopoietic malignances including hodgkin’s disease (hd), human
t-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (htlv-1)-associated adult
t-cell leukemia/lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.5 this pathologic overexpression has been confirmed via
retrospective analysis of  xxxg1175xxx  isoforms in patients with
nhl, hd, and  xxxg2343xxx .6,7 table 1 shows the presence of the
 xxxd924xxx  subunit (cd25), the p75 subunit (cd 122), or both
subunits of the  xxxg1175xxx  in patients expressing  xxxg1175xxx .6

 xxxd1832xxx  - structure and
mechanism of action
 xxxd1832xxx  ( xxxd1832xxx ; seragen inc, san diego, ca;
fig 1) is a fusion protein toxin that combines a targeting
ligand, such as a growth factor, with a cytocidal moiety, such
as a plant or bacterial toxin.  xxxd1832xxx  uses diphtheria toxin as the toxophore which is fused to the full-length
sequence of the il-2 protein. the il-2 moiety of the molecule
directs the fusion toxin to cells bearing  xxxg1175xxx  (fig 2).7 once
bound to the  xxxg1175xxx ,  xxxd1832xxx  it is internalized via
receptor-mediated endocytosis in an acidified vesicle. upon
internalization and acidification,  xxxd1832xxx  is proteolytically cleaved within the endosomes to liberate the enzymatically active portion of the diphtheria toxin. the fragment of diphtheria toxin is translocated across the endosomal

via adp-ribosylation of elongation factor-2, ultimately resulting in cell death.8,9
therapeutic targeting
 xxxg1175xxx  is a heterotrimeric receptor complex consisting of three
distinct subunits: alpha (cd25,  xxxd924xxx ), beta ( xxxg1175xxx , p17),
and gamma ( xxxg1176xxx ,  xxxg1176xxx ). the expression of these subunits
determines the receptor’s binding affinity9:
●

●

●

low-affinity  xxxg1175xxx , consisting of the  xxxg216xxx  with
or without the  xxxg218xxx , and cannot internalize a
ligand;
intermediate-affinity  xxxg1175xxx , consisting of the beta and
gamma subunits, and is capable of internalization of
bound ligand;
high-affinity  xxxg1175xxx , consisting of alpha, beta, and
gamma subunits, and capable of internalizing ligands
with the highest efficiency.

in some leukemias and lymphomas the malignant cells
express one or more of the subunits of the  xxxg1175xxx . however,
the high-affinity form of the receptor is usually only found on
activated t lymphocytes, activated b lymphocytes, and activated macrophages.10 the highest number of high-affinity
 xxxg1175xxx  is found on htlv-1 infected t-cell leukemia cells.

in human hematopoietic cell lines, sensitivity of cells to
 xxxd1832xxx  was shown to be related to the receptor
isoform. re et al11 showed that cells expressing all three subunits had the greatest affinity for  xxxd1832xxx , while
those cells expressing only beta and gamma mrna exhibited
a reduced but significant sensitivity to  xxxd1832xxx . in
contrast, those cells expressing alpha and gamma mrna
were insensitive to the drug. from these data it was concluded that  xxxd1832xxx -mediated cell death requires
the presence of the intermediate- or high-affinity  xxxg1175xxx  and
requires at a minimum the expression of the beta and gamma
subunits.11

 xxxd1832xxx  - pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1832xxx  have been investigated in a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, phase i
trial.6 patients with preserved organ function and histologically confirmed relapsed  xxxg2343xxx , other nhl, or hd were eligible if their cancer was shown to express  xxxg1175xxx , as determined immunohistochemically on tumor tissue using
antibodies directed against the alpha and beta receptor subunits. patients received up to eight courses of denileukin
diftitox given as a short intravenous infusion daily for 5 days
with subsequent courses every 21 days. seventy-three patients (44 men/29 women), aged 16 to 81 years (mean, 51
years) with  xxxg2343xxx  (n ⫽ 35), nhl (n ⫽ 17), or hd (n ⫽ 21)
were enrolled. patients received one to six courses (mean,
3.3) of  xxxd1832xxx  over a range of 3 to 31 ␮g/kg/day.
the maximum tolerated dose was 27 ␮g/kg/day and was
determined based on constitutional symptoms of fatigue and
asthenia. the pharmacokinetics over a 5-day dosing period
were dose-proportional, with higher peak serum concentrations being observed at higher doses.  xxxd1832xxx  undergoes monophasic clearance with no observed cumulative
effects between day 1 and day 5.6
there were five complete and eight partial remissions in

patients with  xxxg2343xxx , with one complete and two partial remissions in patients with nhl. median time to response was
2 months and the duration of response was 2 to 39⫹ months.
no responses were documented in patients with hd.

clinical evaluation of  xxxd1832xxx  in
hematologic disorders
clinical trials with  xxxd1832xxx  have been performed
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drug in patients with
 xxxg2343xxx , b-cell nhl, and acute graft-versus-host disease
(gvhd). studies are currently under way in patients with
peripheral t-cell lymphoma (as a single agent or in combi-

nation with chemotherapy) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (as a single agent or in combination with rituximab).
efficacy in  xxxg2343xxx 
the pivotal trial of  xxxd1832xxx  was a multicenter,
randomized, blinded, parallel-group study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of two doses
of  xxxd1832xxx  in patients with previously treated, advanced, or refractory  xxxg2343xxx .12
patients were required to have skin biopsies demonstrating ⱖ20% of lymphocytes expressing cd25 and were enrolled if they fulfilled the following inclusion criteria:

stage ib–iii  xxxg2343xxx  (either mycosis fungoides or sezary
syndrome), which was recurrent or persistent after four
or more previous  xxxg2343xxx  treatments; or
stage iv  xxxg2343xxx  with at least one previous therapy failure.

patients were excluded from the trial if this previous treatment included therapy with an il-2 fusion protein.
patients were randomized to receive either denileukin
diftitox 9 or 18 ␮g/kg/day administered on 5 consecutive
days every 3 weeks for up to eight cycles and were stratified
by stage (ie, ⱕiia or ⱖiib). all patients were monitored for
toxicity and clinical efficacy, the latter being assessed by
changes in disease burden and quality of life measurements.
antibody levels of anti- xxxd1832xxx  and anti-il-2 were
also measured.12
overall, 30% of the 71 patients with  xxxg2343xxx  treated with
 xxxd1832xxx  had an objective response (20% partial
response; 10% complete response) (fig 3).12 the response
rate, the time to first response (median, 6 weeks; range, 3 to
27 weeks) and duration of response based on the time of the
first dose of study drug for all responders (median duration of
response, 6.9 months; range, 2.7 to 46.1⫹ months) were not
statistically different between the two doses (table 2). however, there was a trend toward an increased response rate
with the higher dose in advanced-stage patients (table 2).12
quality-of-life improvements following  xxxd1832xxx 
therapy were seen both in responders and in non-responders,
and this was mainly as a result of clinical improvements in
pruritus (table 3).12

safety in  xxxg2343xxx 
the overall safety database from the early trials with  xxxd1832xxx  consisted of 143 patients with lymphoma who
were treated on the phase i or phase iii studies.12 of note, the
premedication regimen for these patients included antihistamines and acetaminophen but not corticosteroids. overall,
the most commonly reported adverse events included flulike symptoms (91%), hypoalbuminemia (83%), acute hypersensitivity-type reactions (69%), asthenia (66%), nausea/
vomiting (64%, which led to dehydration in 9% of patients),
infections (48%), and vascular leak syndrome (27%), defined
as hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, and/or peripheral
edema.
all adverse events in the phase iii study 12 were most
severe during the first two cycles of treatment and then diminished significantly. twenty-one percent of patients required hospitalization for drug-related adverse events, but
only 5% of clinical adverse reactions were severe or lifethreatening.13
a number of chemical abnormalities were noted in addition to hypoalbuminemia. hepatic transaminase levels were
elevated in 87 patients (61%) with, 15% of patients reporting
grade 3/4 elevations. most elevations were observed during
the first therapy cycle and diminished during all subsequent
cycles.13 mild elevations in creatinine were rarely noted and
were reversible. there was no significant bone marrow suppression, although lymphocyte counts fluctuated transiently
in some patients.
skin rashes commonly occurred and were occasionally
difficult to discern from the underlying disease. most rashes
were maculopapular and resolved with topical or systemic
corticosteroids. biopsies in several patients distinguished a
drug-related eruption from worsening  xxxg2343xxx . with the onset
of corticosteroid pretreatment, the incidence of skin rashes
has diminished.
effect of steroid pretreatment
a recent study reported an improved safety profile of  xxxd1832xxx  in patients with advanced or refractory
 xxxg2343xxx  who were pretreated with corticosteroids (dexamethasone or prednisone). in comparison with the phase iii
study,12 there was an overall decrease in the number of adverse events and a significant reduction in the number of
grade 3/4 hypersensitivity-related events in patients receiving
steroid premedication (fig 4). furthermore, no patient receiving steroid premedication discontinued therapy as a result of  xxxd1832xxx -related toxicity. interestingly, ste-

roid pretreatment also evoked an increase in the overall
response rate: 60% of patients responded to therapy compared with 30% in the original phase iii trial.
treatment timing
while the initial response rate of  xxxd1832xxx  in early
stage  xxxg2343xxx  was reported to be 38%, the median number of
prior therapies in that population was five. a subsequent
study evaluated the response rate in less heavily pretreated
patients. thirty-seven patients with  xxxg2343xxx  who had a median
of two prior therapies were treated with  xxxd1832xxx 
with steroid premedication and the overall response rate for
stage i-iia was 63% and for patients with stage iib-iv was
48%, respectively.14 complete response rates were similar for
both groups (13% and 14%, respectively). median time to
treatment failure for the early and advanced stage patients
was 10 and 5 months, respectively. this suggests that while
 xxxd1832xxx  is beneficial in  xxxg2343xxx , response rate may
be higher in patients who are earlier in the course of their
disease.
efficacy in nhl and gvhd
in a phase ii study by dang et al,14 the efficacy and safety of
 xxxd1832xxx  in 50 patients with relapsed or refractory
b-cell nhl was evaluated.  xxxd1832xxx  was administered intravenously at a dose of 18 ␮g/kg once daily for 5 days
every 3 weeks, for up to eight cycles. of the 45 patients
evaluable for response, 32 (71%) were refractory to the last
chemotherapy treatment. three complete responses (7%)
and 8 partial responses (18%) were observed, with an overall
response rate of 25%; 9 patients (20%) had stable disease.
objective response rates were similar in cd25⫹ (22%) and
cd25– histologies (29%), as were stable disease rates (22%
and 18%, respectively). for responding patients, median
time to treatment failure was 7 months, with a median follow-up in survivors of 18 months (range, 9 to 28 months).
most toxicities were low grade and transient. these findings
suggest that  xxxd1832xxx  is effective in relapsed or
refractory b-cell nhl and is well tolerated at the dosage

evaluated. the use of this drug in combination with other
agents may be warranted.
evaluation of the effectiveness of  xxxd1832xxx  in
acute gvhd was reported by ho et al.15 of 30 patients with
steroid-refractory acute gvhd, seven received denileukin
diftitox 9 ␮g/kg intravenously on days 1 and 15, 18 patients
received 9 ␮g/kg intravenously on days 1, 3, 5, 15, 17, and
19, and five patients received 9 ␮g/kg intravenously on days
1 through 5 and days 15 through 19. overall, 71% of patients
responded with either complete (12 of 24; 50%) or partial
resolution (5 of 24; 21%) of gvhd. hepatic transaminase
elevation was the dose-limiting toxicity. these findings suggest that  xxxd1832xxx  also has promising activity in
steroid-refractory acute gvhd.

conclusion
 xxxg1175xxx -targeted therapy appears to be an effective treatment
option in a variety of diseases, including  xxxg2343xxx  and b- and
t-cell lymphomas and gvhd.  xxxd1832xxx  is a targeted therapy that has high specificity for intermediate- and
high-affinity  xxxg1175xxx , which are overexpressed in a number of
leukemias and lymphomas.  xxxd1832xxx  is not myelosuppressive, nor is it associated with significant organ toxicity. in patients with  xxxg2343xxx , early administration of denileukin
diftitox may improve overall response, and pretreating patients with corticosteroids may confer additional safety benefits.
