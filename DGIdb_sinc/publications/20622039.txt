rationale: prostacyclin analogs, used to treat idiopathic pulmonary
arterial hypertension (ipah), are assumed to work through prostacyclin (ip) receptors linked to  xxxd1773xxx  (camp) generation,
although the potential to signal through peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor-g ( xxxg1807xxx ) exists.
objectives:  xxxg1879xxx  and  xxxg1807xxx  expression may be depressed in
ipah. we wished to determine if pathways remain functional and if
analogs continue to inhibit smooth muscle proliferation.
methods: we used western blotting to determine  xxxg1879xxx 
expression in peripheral pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells
(pasmcs) from normal and ipah lungs and immunohistochemistry
to evaluate  xxxg1879xxx  and  xxxg1807xxx  expression in distal arteries.
measurements and main results: cell proliferation and camp assays
assessed analog responses in human and mouse pasmcs and hek293 cells. proliferative rates of ipah cells were greater than normal
human pasmcs.  xxxg1879xxx  protein levels were lower in pasmcs
from patients with ipah, but  xxxd3415xxx  reduced replication and
 xxxd3415xxx -induced camp elevation appeared normal. responses to
prostacyclin analogs were largely dependent on the  xxxg1879xxx  and
camp in normal pasmcs, although in ip2/2 receptor cells analogs
inhibited growth in a camp-independent,  xxxg1807xxx -dependent manner. in ipah cells, antiproliferative responses to analogs were insensitive to  xxxg1879xxx  or adenylyl cyclase antagonists but were
potentiated by a  xxxg1807xxx  agonist and inhibited (z 60%) by the  xxxg1807xxx 
antagonist  xxxd1216xxx . this coincided with increased  xxxg1807xxx  expression in the medial layer of acinar arteries.
conclusions: the antiproliferative effects of prostacyclin analogs are
preserved in ipah despite  xxxg1879xxx  down-regulation and abnormal coupling.  xxxg1807xxx  may represent a previously unrecognized
pathway by which these agents inhibit smooth muscle proliferation.

at a glance commentary
scientific knowledge on the subject

parental prostacyclin therapy remains the gold standard for
the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah),
though decreased expression of the  xxxg1879xxx , the
classical biological target for prostacyclin, may occur in
pah. whether this impacts on the ability of these agents to
work in pah is an important clinical question.
what this study adds to the field

down-regulation of the  xxxg1879xxx , related to chronic
treatment with prostacyclin, occurred in pah but did not
affect the ability of these agents to inhibit pulmonary
smooth muscle cell proliferation from these patients. the
mechanism differed from normal cells because neither the
 xxxg1879xxx  nor  xxxd1773xxx –mediated effects but were in
part mediated by the peroxisome proliferator–activated
receptor-gamma. thus, peroxisome proliferator–activated
receptor-gamma may represent a therapeutic target in
pah.

phodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, all of which improve hemodynamics, exercise tolerance, and clinical status (3). an impact on
survival is assumed, although this has only been demonstrated
for prostacyclin (3). other prostacyclin analogs, such as  xxxd2331xxx 
and  xxxd3415xxx , have been developed to offer greater plasma
stability and alterative routes of administration. prostacyclin
and its analogs are thought to slow pulmonary vascular disease
progression by reversing the abnormal remodeling process (4).
eventually, however, medications are no longer effective, and
lung transplantation is required (5). thus, the clinician cannot
be certain that the patient continues to derive benefit from the
drugs when they are clearly deteriorating.
in previous studies, replication of normal pulmonary artery
smooth muscle cells (pasmcs) was reduced by prostacyclin
analogs in a largely  xxxd1773xxx  (camp)-dependent manner (6,
7). however, the extent to which the prostacyclin (ip) receptor
mediates the effects of prostacyclin analogs is not clear. not only
can these agents activate other prostanoid receptors (8), but they
can also signal through nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptors (ppars) (9), a family of transcription factors regulating diverse biological processes such as cell growth, apoptosis,
inflammation, and insulin sensitivity (10). activation of ppars
can occur via direct ligand binding or as a consequence of receptor
activation (11).
whether prostacyclin analogs suppress replication of pasmcs
from patients with ipah and act through the same transduction
pathway as normal pasmcs is unknown. we hypothesized that

1162

american journal of respiratory and critical care medicine

pasmcs from patients with ipah would fail to respond normally because  xxxg1879xxx  density had decreased (12), because
the receptor had become dysfunctional, or both. reduced expression of  xxxg1807xxx , reported in adult ipah lungs (13), might
also reduce prostacyclin analog signaling through this pathway.
therefore, we examined expression and function of ip receptors and  xxxg1807xxx  in pasmcs grown from the lungs of patients
with ipah and compared findings in pasmcs derived from
normal lungs and from mice with and without the  xxxg1879xxx .
despite reduced  xxxg1879xxx  levels in end-stage ipah, the
antiproliferative effects of prostacyclin analogs in pasmcs
were preserved but did not involve the  xxxg1879xxx . in normal
cells,  xxxg1879xxx –dependent and  xxxg1879xxx –independent
mechanisms prevailed. furthermore,  xxxg1807xxx  was strongly expressed in the pulmonary arterial media in ipah and assumed
a greater role in mediating the antigrowth effects of  xxxd3415xxx 
in pasmcs isolated from these patients compared with pasmcs
from normal subjects.

nin before injection into rabbits using standard protocols (eurogentec,
seraing, belgium). bleeds were assayed for activity using a standard
elisa assay, and those showing reactivity were affinity purified.

immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
blocks of lung tissue containing preacinar and intraacinar arteries were
obtained from normal children and from nontreated and treated
children with ipah. blood vessels were immunostained as previously
described (16) using cell-specific markers (figure e2c and e2d) and
antibodies to  xxxg1807xxx  (cell signaling technology, danvers ma) and
the  xxxg1879xxx . slides were examined using a leica dm lb microscope (leica microsystems, wetzlar, germany), and images were
acquired and analyzed in a blinded fashion (details provided in the
online supplement). for immunofluoresence, monolayers of cultured
cells were fixed and permeabilized and then stained for the  xxxg1879xxx 
and nuclei (to-pro-3; invitrogen, paisley, uk). images were viewed
and analyzed using a laser-scanning confocal microscope.

western blotting
 xxxg1879xxx  protein expression was determined using conventional
techniques. blots were processed and developed using the ecl plus

methods
expanded methods can be found in the online supplement.

patient characteristics
lung tissue was taken after patient or relative consent and with ethics
committee approval from great ormond street (ich and gosh rec
05/q0508/45), papworth hospital (rec h00/531/ t) and brompton and
harefield trust (nhli rec 01-210) through dr. wharton (imperial
college, london, uk). samples were obtained from patients with ipah
who were undergoing transplant after failed treatment (six children, four
adults) or who had not undergone therapy (eight children). treated
children received epoprostenol for 1.3 to 4 years; adult patients were on
varying prostacyclin therapy for an average of 1.2 years. one adult had
a mutation (n903s) in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type ii
(bmprii) (14). all patients had advanced pulmonary vascular disease
(heath and edwards grade 4–5). for controls, tissue was obtained from
normal children (n 5 5) and from adults undergoing transplant or lung
resection for suspected malignancy (n 5 6).

pasmcs and hek-293 cells
peripheral pasmcs were isolated from patients with ipah (n 5 7)
and from control adults (n 5 6). control intrapulmonary pasmcs
derived from a 2.5-month-old child were obtained from lonza group
ltd. (basel, switzerland). pasmcs used in the study stained for
a-smooth muscle actin and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (see
figure e2e in the online supplement). hek-293 cells stably expressing
the human  xxxg1879xxx  (hek-293-ip) or empty vector (control) have
previously been generated (11). distal pasmcs from homozygous ip
receptor–deficient (n 5 6) and wild-type (n 5 7) mice were isolated
and cultured as described in the online supplement.

cell proliferation assays
for determination of cell number in hek-293 cells and pasmcs, cells
were seeded onto 6-well plates at a density of 0.5 to 2 3 104 cells/ml,
grown for 24 hours, and starved in low serum for 48 hours. cells were
then incubated in medium containing 10% fbs with and without the
relevant test agent and counted at 24-hour intervals using an automated cell counter (sysmex f-520p; malvern instruments ltd., worcestershire, uk). fbs-induced growth was assessed at a single point in
cells incubated for 48 (hek-293) or 96 hours (pasmcs). analog doses
were chosen to give a maximal rise in  xxxd1773xxx  (0.1–1 mm) (7) and
substantial (z40–50%) inhibition of cell growth. [3h]thymidine
incorporation into distal pasmcs from wild-type and  xxxg1879xxx –
deficient mice was performed as previously described (15). assays were
undertaken in the presence of 0.1% fbs, 10% fbs, or platelet-derived
growth factor (pdgf)-bb (10 ng/ml).

 xxxg1879xxx  antibody production
a peptide corresponding to the c terminus of the human  xxxg1879xxx 
(rrdprapsavgke) was synthesized and conjugated to hemocya-

pamscs was similar to that observed between hek-293-ip
and control hek-293 cells (figure 1c), where stably expressing
the  xxxg1879xxx  significantly (p , 0.001; n 5 6) slowed hek-293
cell growth. differences in replication rates are unlikely to
relate to basal  xxxg1879xxx  activity because pretreatment with
the  xxxg1879xxx  antagonist ro1183452 (17) failed to increase
the growth of hek-293-ip cells (figure 1c).

 xxxg1807xxx  reporter gene assay

 xxxg1879xxx  expression in human pasmcs

the luciferase reporter pgal5tkpgl3 was cotransfected into hek293-ip cells with pmluc2 (renilla control vector) and gal4-hppargpcdna3 (vector containing the human  xxxg1807xxx  ligand-binding domain)
as described (11). data are shown as luciferase activity normalized to
renilla.

given that  xxxg1879xxx  loss accelerates cell growth, we examined if expression might be down-regulated in pasmcs derived
from patients with ipah. we used a c-terminal antibody that
preferentially stains hek-293 cells stably expressing the ip
receptor but not control cells (figure e1a). in normal pasmcs
cells,  xxxg1879xxx  staining was localized to the membrane and
within the cytosol, whereas in ipah cells, staining was weaker
and localized more in the cytosol (figure 2a). western blotting
confirmed the existence of a major immunoreactive band with
an apparent molecular weight of approximately 53 kd in all
human pasmc samples tested (figure 2b). a band of similar
weight was observed in hek-293-ip cells but was barely
detectable in control hek-293 cells. analysis of bands with
normalization to b-actin staining showed that in ipah cells
from adults and children, band intensity was approximately
65% of that observed in normal human pasmc lysates (p ,
0.01) (figure 2c). likewise, the  xxxg1879xxx  mrna band
intensity was consistently weaker in ipah cells (figure e1c).

comparative proliferation rates of human

isolates of pasmcs derived from lungs of adults and children
with ipah proliferated significantly (p , 0.001; n 5 9–12) more
than normal adult pasmcs cultured under the same conditions
(figures 1a and 1b). however, the growth of pediatric ipah
cells was approximately double that of adult ipah cells over
a 5-day period (figure 1a), although this difference was largely
masked if growth was normalized to cell number at t 5 0 (figure
1b). this striking difference between hypertensive and normal

from untreated and treated children with ipah (figure 3). ip
receptor expression was strong in the smooth muscle layer of
normal children (figure 3aa) and well preserved in untreated
ipah samples (figures 3ab and figure 3b). no significant
staining was observed with the secondary antibody alone
(figure e2b). in treated ipah samples,  xxxg1879xxx  expression
was weaker (p , 0.05) in pasmcs of intraacinar arteries
compared with untreated samples, although no difference was
observed in preacinar arteries. in intimal proliferative cells, ip
receptor staining was weak regardless of treatment (figures
3ab and 3ac and figure 3b). with respect to  xxxg1807xxx , staining
was weak in smooth muscle layer of normal peripheral arteries
(figure  xxxd1750xxx ) but consistently present in this layer in all ipah
samples (figures 3ae and 3af). analysis showed expression
was significantly increased in pre- and intraacinar arteries (p ,
0.05; n 5 5–8) (figure 3c). in regions of intimal proliferation,
staining was weak or undetectable (figure 3af, asterisk).
 xxxd3415xxx  effects on camp and cell growth

to test receptor functionality, the effects of  xxxd3415xxx  (provided by united therapeutics, silver spring, md) on camp
levels were assessed at the peak time (30 min) of elevation in
normal human and ipah pasmcs. despite differences in ip
receptor expression,  xxxd3415xxx  (100 nm) elevated camp on
average by 3-fold in normal and ipah cells. camp elevation
was abolished by pretreatment with  xxxg1879xxx  antagonist
ro1183452 (1 mm) and also in hek-293-ip cells, where
increases were previously substantial (40-fold) (figure 4c).
the fact that ro1183452 has no significant affinity at other
prostanoid receptors (17) suggests that the  xxxg1879xxx  is the
major source of camp in pasmcs. next, we assessed time-

vol 182

2010

dependent effects of  xxxd3415xxx  on cell proliferation. in normal
and ipah cell isolates,  xxxd3415xxx  inhibited proliferation.
thus, at days 4 and 5, proliferation was approximately 40%
lower than in fbs alone (p , 0.001) (figures 4a and 4b). the
antiproliferative effects of  xxxd3415xxx  (and those of another
prostacyclin analog, cicaprost) on hek-293-ip cells were
greater (z72% inhibition at day 5) than observed in human
pasmcs (figure 4c).
role of the  xxxg1879xxx  in mediating antigrowth effects

whether prostacyclin analogs mediate their antigrowth effects
in the lung solely through the  xxxg1879xxx  remains an important
clinical question. therefore, we investigated the effect of
ro1183452 on analog inhibition of cell growth at 4 days in
human pasmcs. in normal pasmcs, ro1183452 significantly
(p , 0.001; n 5 12) reversed the antiproliferative effects of
100 nm  xxxd3415xxx  (figure 5a) and  xxxd2331xxx  (schering ag,
berlin, germany). (figure e3), although, with respect to
 xxxd3415xxx , this was incomplete when compared with the
solvent control dmso (p , 0.01). at higher  xxxd3415xxx  doses
(1 mm), there was only a trend toward reversal with ro1183452
(figure 5a), which contrasted with hek-293-ip cells, where
responses were fully inhibited by the  xxxg1879xxx  antagonist at
that dose (figure 5b). the antiproliferative effects of  xxxd3415xxx  and  xxxd2331xxx  were essentially insensitive to ro1183452 in
ipah cells from children and adults (figures 5c and 5d).
to confirm that pgi2 analogs could inhibit cell growth
independently of the  xxxg1879xxx , primary cell lines of distal
pasmcs were generated from wild-type and  xxxg1879xxx 
(ip2/2)–deficient mice. in wild-type cells, cicaprost (schering
ag) elevated camp by 4-fold (figure 6a) but had no effect in

ip2/2 cells (figure 6b).  xxxd2331xxx  elevated camp in mutant cells
but by a substantially lesser amount. this contrasted with
 xxxd1742xxx , whose effects on camp levels were similar in both
cell types. in 3h-thymidine incorporation studies, pdgf (10 ng/ml)
induced a significant increase in dna synthesis compared with
control wells. in wild-type distal pasmcs, cicaprost and  xxxd2331xxx 
elicited concentration-dependent attenuation of pdgf-induced
3h-thymidine incorporation (figures 6c and 6d). in mutant
cells, these agents only inhibited dna synthesis at the highest
agonist concentration (1 mm), consistent with ip-receptor dependent and independent mechanisms of growth inhibition.
role of camp

we reported previously that the adenylyl cyclase antagonist 2’59
 xxxd929xxx  (dda) was an effective inhibitor of the

growth suppression induced by  xxxd3415xxx  and  xxxd2331xxx  in
proximal pasmcs (7). therefore, we sought to investigate
the role of camp in distal pasmcs. treatment with 100 mm
dda alone had no significant effect on cell proliferation in
human pasmcs (n 5 9; p 5 0.37) (figures 7a and 7b),
although it did inhibit proliferation in hek-293-ip cells (33.4 6
3.2% inhibition compared with untreated controls; n 5 8; p ,
0.001) (figure 7c). responses to 100 nm  xxxd3415xxx  were
significantly (n 5 9; p , 0.01) attenuated approximately 60% by
dda in normal pasmcs, but no effect of dda was observed
in ipah cells from adults and children. by contrast, reversal of
the antiproliferative response was complete in hek-293-ip
cells compared with serum-induced growth in the presence of
dda. it was incomplete (75%) with respect to serum alone
(figure 7c), perhaps reflecting some residual camp elevation

with  xxxd3415xxx  in the presence of dda. at the higher  xxxd3415xxx  concentration (1 mm), dda had no effect on normal or
ipah cells despite it fully inhibiting camp generation (figure
4b). these results suggest a largely camp-independent mechanism of growth inhibition for prostacyclin analogs in ipah cells
despite the ability of the adenylyl cyclase activator  xxxd1742xxx  to
inhibit proliferation in these cells (figure 7b).
role of  xxxg1807xxx 

given the evidence that loss of  xxxg1807xxx  might cause or contribute to pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) and vascular
remodeling (13, 18), we first sought to confirm that the  xxxg1807xxx 
pathway was functional in our cells. we used the selective
 xxxg1807xxx  agonist rosiglitazone, which inhibited serum-induced
growth with a similar potency in normal, ipah, and hek-293ip cells (ec50 35, 43, and 45 mm, respectively) (figure 8a). to
confirm specificity of  xxxg1807xxx  modulators and to provide further
evidence for  xxxg1807xxx  activation, we transfected hek-293-ip
cells with a  xxxg1807xxx  reporter construct. this was activated 6-fold
by rosiglitazone (1 mm), an effect abolished by pretreatment
with the  xxxg1807xxx  antagonist  xxxd1216xxx  at 100 nm or 1 mm, with
partial inhibition  xxxd1891xxx  nm (figure e4). likewise,  xxxd3415xxx 
(1 mm) significantly (2- to 3-fold) increased  xxxg1807xxx  activity,
with luciferase activity detected as early as 4 hours, peaking at
approximately 12 hours, and remaining stable thereafter (figure
8b). over the same time period, there was no significant change
in basal activity (p 5 0.18; n 5 4).
next we determined whether  xxxg1807xxx  could contribute to
prostacyclin analog effects in smooth muscle. pretreatment of normal human pasmcs with 1 mm  xxxd1216xxx  caused a small (z 24%)
but significant (p , 0.05) reversal of the antiproliferative effects
of 100 nm  xxxd3415xxx  (figure 8c). by contrast, the antagonist
reversed the antiproliferative effects of  xxxd3415xxx  by approximately 60% (n 5 15; p , 0.001) in ipah cells, although it had
no effect on growth by itself (figure 8d). moreover, in ipah
cells, rosiglitazone (300 nm) potentiated the antiproliferative

effects of  xxxd3415xxx  such that it could significantly (p , 0.01)
inhibit growth below 1 nm. no additive effects were seen at
higher  xxxd3415xxx  (. 10 nm) concentrations, suggesting that
both agents activate a common pathway. finally, we found that
 xxxd1216xxx  (100 nm) could reverse the effects of cicaprost on
pdgf-induced 3h-thymidine incorporation in ip2/2 cells, suggesting that the prostacyclin analog can affect  xxxg1807xxx  independently of the  xxxg1879xxx  and camp. however,  xxxd1216xxx 
augmented pdgf-induced 3h-thymidine incorporation when
applied by itself, indicative of increased basal  xxxg1807xxx  activity in
ip2/2 cells, although we cannot exclude non– xxxg1807xxx -mediated
effects.

discussion
from a clinical perspective, we addressed the question of
whether patients deteriorating with advanced pulmonary disease continue to derive benefit from a therapy that might downregulate the target ( xxxg1879xxx ) it is seeking to activate.
specifically, we wished to establish whether prostacyclin analogs would suppress the replication of pasmcs isolated from
patients with ipah and to determine whether this involved the
 xxxg1879xxx . we found that the ability of  xxxd3415xxx  and
 xxxd2331xxx  to increase camp and suppress growth of pasmcs
was not impaired in end-stage disease despite a reduction in ip
receptor expression, which was more marked in pulmonary
vessels from prostacyclin-treated than from untreated patients
with ipah. the striking finding in this study was that neither
the  xxxg1879xxx  nor camp appeared to mediate the antiproliferative effects of prostacyclin analogs in ipah cells as they did
to a large extent in normal pasmcs. experiments in ip2/2 cells
confirmed that non- xxxg1879xxx  mechanisms prevailed at higher
(1 mm) analog concentrations. significant enhancement of
 xxxg1807xxx  expression was found in the medial layer of arteries
from patients with ipah, and the  xxxg1807xxx  antagonist  xxxd1216xxx 
substantially inhibited the antiproliferative effect of  xxxd3415xxx

in ipah cells but had less effect in normal pasmcs. moreover,
the  xxxg1807xxx  agonist rosiglitazone potentiated the antiproliferative effects of  xxxd3415xxx  in a manner that suggests they share
a common pathway. thus, we show for the first time that
 xxxg1807xxx  may represent an important therapeutic target by which
prostacyclin analogs work in ipah.
role of the  xxxg1879xxx  in ipah

we found that  xxxg1879xxx  mrna and protein levels were
reduced in pasmcs from patients with ipah, consistent with
recent studies showing  xxxg1879xxx  loss in whole lungs from
patients with ipah and in rats after monocrotaline treatment
(12). furthermore, intimal proliferating cells of distal vessels
stained weakly for the  xxxg1879xxx , which agrees with reports of
decreased expression of  xxxg1880xxx  in small pulmonary arterial vessels in ipah and its absence in concentric
plexiform lesions (19). several reasons suggest that reduced ip
receptor expression might be detrimental in ipah.  xxxg1879xxx –
null mice develop more severe pah and pulmonary arterial
medial thickening in response to chronic hypoxia than wild-type
mice (20). they are also more susceptible to injury-induced
vascular proliferation and thrombosis and have elevated plasma
levels of thromboxane a2 (21), all common features of ipah

(22–24). in this study, we found that reduced  xxxg1879xxx 
expression was associated with a doubling of the growth rate
in ipah compared with normal pasmcs. conversely, hek293 cells stably expressing the  xxxg1879xxx  grew at half the rate
of those without the receptor. thus,  xxxg1879xxx  deficiency
could contribute to enhanced growth in ipah by allowing
growth factor signaling, which is elevated in patients ipah (25),
to go unopposed. however,  xxxg1879xxx  deficiency alone is
unlikely to explain the more aggressive proliferative rate of
ipah cells from children compared with adults because both
groups had similar levels of  xxxg1879xxx  expression. moreover,
ip2/2 receptor mice do not develop spontaneous pulmonary
hypertension, suggesting that the  xxxg1879xxx  is a modulator
rather than an instigator of the disease process (20).
 xxxg1879xxx  desensitization could be a problem to the clinician using long-term prostacyclin to treat ipah.  xxxg1879xxx 
staining was less in intraacinar arteries from treated compared
with untreated patients with ipah. the former had been on
prostacyclin therapy, some as long as 4 years.  xxxd2331xxx  is known
to induce rapid time- and concentration-dependent phosphorylation and internalization of the  xxxg1879xxx  (26). such an
effect could explain the more diffuse and largely cytosolic
staining we observed in pasmcs of treated patients with

liferative effects of  xxxd3415xxx  or  xxxd2331xxx  in pasmcs from
patients with ipah.
antiproliferative mechanism of prostacyclin analogs

our results imply a substantial role for  xxxg1879xxx –induced
camp mediating growth inhibition in normal human pasmcs
and hek-293-ip cells. not only did the  xxxg1879xxx  antagonist
and adenylyl cyclase inhibitor substantially inhibit antiproliferative responses to low (< 100 nm) concentrations of prostacyclin
analogs, but gene deletion of the  xxxg1879xxx  in mouse pasmcs
did also. these results confirm earlier observations of camp
involvement in analog inhibition of mitogenic responses to pdgf
and serum in human pasmcs (6, 7). however, the antiproliferative effects of prostacyclin analogs were still observed in ip2/2
cells, and neither the  xxxg1879xxx  antagonist nor the adenylate
cyclase inhibitor 2959dideoxyadenosine significantly reversed the
effects to higher (1 mm) analog concentrations in normal human
pasmcs, strongly suggesting that additional mechanisms are
involved. indeed, the small but significant reversal of the antiproliferative effect with the  xxxg1807xxx  antagonist  xxxd1216xxx  in
normal human and ip2/2 mouse pasmcs suggests the involvement of  xxxg1807xxx . likewise,  xxxd3415xxx  activated a luciferase
reporter construct encoding the human  xxxg1807xxx  ligand binding
domain in hek-293-ip cells. we and others have shown that
cicaprost and  xxxd2331xxx  can also activate  xxxg1807xxx , inhibiting seruminduced cell growth (11) or lung tumorigenesis (29). the mechanism of  xxxg1807xxx  activation is not well understood. it does not
appear to require camp but may involve  xxxg1879xxx –dependent
and  xxxg1879xxx –independent pathways (11, 29). our results in
ip2/2 mouse pasmcs favor the latter, although we cannot rule
out the possibility in these experiments that  xxxd1216xxx  is acting in
a non– xxxg1807xxx -dependent manner because it enhanced pdgfinduced growth on its own. however, knockdown of  xxxg1807xxx  in
endothelial cells enhances lung pdgf receptor protein levels
(30), and  xxxg1807xxx  can oppose pdgf signaling in human pasmcs
(18), thus providing a plausible explanation for the specificity of
the observed effects of  xxxd1216xxx .

ipah. the mechanism of receptor desensitization can be
overcome with  xxxg1872xxx  blockade in rabbit lungs (27). that
 xxxd2331xxx  (and to a lesser extent prostacyclin) can bind to
contractile ep1 and ep3 receptors with a similar potency to ip
receptors (8, 9) suggests that tachyphylaxis to these agents may
be accentuated in ipah. alternatively, loss of the  xxxg1879xxx 
may drive prostacyclin analogs to signal through other gscoupled prostanoid receptors, including  xxxg1875xxx  for  xxxd2331xxx  (12)
and  xxxg1873xxx  for  xxxd3415xxx  (28). thus, the possibility that these
receptors contribute analog effects in ipah cells cannot be
excluded. consistent with this notion, we found that  xxxd2331xxx 
increased camp in  xxxg1879xxx –deficient pasmcs. whether
the combination of reduced receptor expression and increased
desensitization explains the customary need to escalate the dose
of prostacyclin and its analogs as pah progresses is unclear
because the  xxxg1879xxx  did not seem to mediate the antipro-

an important finding was the striking increase of  xxxg1807xxx 
expression in the medial layer of diseased pulmonary arteries
and the enhanced effects of the  xxxg1807xxx  antagonist on cell growth.
this suggests a greater role for  xxxg1807xxx  in the regulation of
pasmc growth in ipah. as in the present study, voelkel and
colleagues found little  xxxg1807xxx  staining in the medial layer of
normal lungs or in the proliferating cells of plexiform lesions, but
they did not examine  xxxg1807xxx  expression in the pulmonary
smooth muscle of patients with ipah (13). the consequence of
elevated  xxxg1807xxx  expression within the medial layer and its
impact on disease progression warrants further investigation to
determine whether increased expression translates into enhanced
 xxxg1807xxx  activity or responsiveness to endogenous ligand activators, such as the prostaglandin metabolite 5-deoxy-delta-12,14prostaglandin j2 (10). the overlapping concentration–response
curves to the antiproliferative effects of the  xxxg1807xxx  agonist
rosiglitazone we observed in pasmcs from normal and ipah
cells suggests not.  xxxg1807xxx  activity may remain low because of
pdgf-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of  xxxg1807xxx  or
loss of signaling through bmrpii (31), a receptor pathway that
inhibits pasmc proliferation by counteracting the effects of
pdgf on  xxxg1807xxx  (18). however, pasmcs derived from a patient with a loss-of-function mutation in bmprii (14) can be
rescued by  xxxg1807xxx  agonists, suggesting that  xxxg1807xxx  remains
a viable target when combatting abnormal proliferation in ipah
regardless of the bmprii status of the patient (18). the

molar range when applied in combination with rosiglitazone may
argue for sensitization of the  xxxg1807xxx  pathway. the effects of
rosiglitazone were not additive at higher  xxxd3415xxx  concentrations, suggesting that both agents activate a common pathway
that eventually saturates. the mechanism of this potentiation is
unknown.  xxxd3415xxx  and rosiglitazone can interact with the
ligand-binding domain of  xxxg1807xxx  (10, 11), so that one agent could
enhance the binding of the other ligand activator, thus allowing
 xxxg1807xxx  to activate at lower agonist concentrations.  xxxg1807xxx  also
contains many phosphorylation sites (32), so that prostacyclin
analogs may modulate  xxxg1807xxx  agonist activity in that way. it
remains to be determined whether a combination therapy involving a prostacyclin and  xxxg1807xxx  agonist would translate into
patient benefit with increased survival. targeted deletion of
 xxxg1807xxx  in smooth muscle causes pulmonary hypertension and
muscularization of distal pulmonary arteries (18), demonstrating
the importance of  xxxg1807xxx  in regulating lung function. the idea
that  xxxg1807xxx  might be a clinically relevant target in pulmonary
vascular disease is supported by recent work showing that rosiglitazone can reverse mucularization of distal pulmonary arteries in
male apoe2/2 mice with severe pah (33).
in summary, we have identified a novel mechanism by which
prostacyclin analogs inhibit pasmc growth in patients with
ipah. the mechanism does not require the classical pathway of

 xxxg1879xxx  activation and camp elevation but involves  xxxg1807xxx ,
itself a major regulator of vascular remodeling and inflammation
in the lung. clarification of these interrelated signaling pathways
will be crucial in identifying novel targets to improve the treatment of patients with pah. the combination of prostacyclin
analogs and  xxxg1807xxx  agonists appears likely to be a helpful antiproliferative therapy to target abnormal vascular remodeling.
