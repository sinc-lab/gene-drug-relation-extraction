benzodiazepines (bzds) remain important agents in the management
of epilepsy. they are drugs of ﬁrst choice for status epilepticus and
seizures associated with post-anoxic insult and are also frequently used
in the treatment of febrile, acute repetitive and alcohol withdrawal
seizures. clinical advantages of these drugs include rapid onset of
action, high eﬃcacy rates and minimal toxicity. benzodiazepines are
used in a variety of clinical situations because they have a broad
spectrum of clinical activity and can be administered via several routes.
potential shortcomings of bzds include tolerance, withdrawal
symptoms, adverse events, such as cognitive impairment and sedation,
and drug interactions. benzodiazepines diﬀer in their pharmacologic
eﬀects and pharmacokinetic proﬁles, which dictate how the drugs are
used. among the approximately 35 bzds available, a select few are
used for the management of seizures and epilepsy:  xxxd1718xxx ,
clonazepam, clorazepate, diazepam, lorazepam and midazolam.
among these bzds, clorazepate has a unique proﬁle that includes a
long half-life of its active metabolite and slow onset of tolerance.
additionally, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of clorazepate
(particularly the sustained-release formulation) could theoretically
help minimize adverse events. however, larger, controlled studies of
clorazepate are needed to further examine its role in the treatment of
patients with epilepsy.

introduction

much attention has been focused on the introduction of new antiepileptic drugs (aeds) into the us
market during the past 15 years. nonetheless,
benzodiazepines (bzds), which have been used
since the 1960s, remain important in epilepsy
management and are the drugs of ﬁrst choice for
status epilepticus and seizures associated with postanoxic insult. benzodiazepines also continue to
play major roles in treating other conditions such
as febrile seizures, acute repetitive seizures and
alcohol withdrawal seizures. the major clinical
advantages of bzds are high eﬃcacy rates, rapid
onset of action and minimal toxicity. few other
drugs possess comparable attributes.

all bzds share similar neuropharmacologic
properties including anxiety reduction, sedation,
sleep induction, anticonvulsant eﬀects and muscle
relaxation (1). there are, however, differences
among bzds in afﬁnity for receptor subtypes,
which may produce different pharmacologic
effects. thus, some bzds are more effective than
others as anticonvulsants; few of the approximately 35 bzds available worldwide (2) are used
for managing epilepsy. diazepam and lorazepam
are primarily used for management of seizure
emergencies, whereas  xxxd1718xxx , clonazepam and
clorazepate are commonly used in chronic epilepsy
management. midazolam often is used as an
alternative to diazepam and lorazepam in seizure
emergencies and for treating refractory status
69

riss et al.
epilepticus. the bzds also have widely varying
pharmacokinetic proﬁles, with differences in
absorption, onset and duration of action and
formation of active metabolites. thus, pharmacokinetic differences often dictate the use of speciﬁc
bzds, route(s) of administration and formulation(s). additionally, the nature and importance of
side effects and drug interactions have been identiﬁed and clariﬁed in recent years.
the purpose of this review was to provide
clinicians with information for selecting bzds
and for managing  xxxd1459xxx  therapy in their patients.
the article considers  xxxd1459xxx  pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, use in epilepsy management, tolerance and withdrawal. also included in this review
is an analysis and discussion of the eﬀects of missed
daily doses of immediate- and extended-release
clorazepate formulations on plasma n-desmethyldiazepam (dmd) concentrations.
benzodiazepine pharmacology

there are three principal c- xxxd2177xxx 
(gaba) receptor subtypes. ligand-activated ion
channels that are selectively blocked by bicuculline
and modulated by steroids, bzds, and barbiturates are known as gabaa receptors (3). the
second receptor subtype, gabab, consists of
g-protein-coupled, seven-transmembrane receptors, which are selectively activated by (r)-())baclofen and 3-aminopropylphosphinic acid and
are blocked by phaclofen (3). transmitter-gated
chloride channels, gabac receptors, are selectively activated by certain conformationally
restricted gaba analogs and are not modulated
by steroids, bzds or barbiturates (3).
benzodiazepines bind to gabaa receptors,
ionotropic transmembrane proteins located in the
neuronal membranes of the central nervous
system (cns) (3). the gabaa receptor consists
of a pentameric structure with multiple subunits
that are necessary for normal physiologic function. the receptor subunits are assembled from
combinations of 19 polypeptides (i.e. a1–6, b1–3,
c1–3, d, e, p, h and q1–3) (4); different subunit
combinations determine the pharmacologic properties of the receptor (5, 6). the number and
types of subunits vary depending on the location
of the receptor in the cns (7). the inhibitory
neurotransmitter gaba binds to the receptor to
open the chloride ion gates and produce an
inhibitory current (6, 8). binding of bzds to the
c subunit of the receptor is important in the
potentiation of gabaergic inhibition (9). differentiation between bzds and gaba is important. benzodiazepines do not substitute for
70

gaba, but instead enhance the inhibitory effects
of gaba. benzodiazepines allosterically bind to
the receptor at a different location than gaba
does and enhance the chloride channelõs conductance by increasing the frequency of gated channel opening (6, 7, 10–12).
in the search for  xxxd1459xxx  site ligands with higher
therapeutic selectivity and a more favorable safety
proﬁle, gabaa receptor subtypes have long been
considered promising targets (13). the pharmacologic relevance of gabaa receptor subtypes has
been identiﬁed using a gene knock-in strategy in
rodents. based on in vivo point mutations,
a-1-gabaa receptors have been found to mediate
sedation and anterograde amnesia and to partially mediate anticonvulsant activity, whereas
a-2-gabaa receptors mediate anxiolysis (14, 15).
the basic chemical structure of bzds is formed
from the fusion of a benzene ring and a sevenmembered diazepine ring (16) (fig. 1).  xxxd1718xxx  is
an exception with its 1-5- xxxd1459xxx  structure (17). the
common chemical structure of the bzds accounts
for their similar mechanisms of action.
in pharmacologic terms,  xxxd1459xxx  potency refers to
the in vivo aﬃnity of the drug (or its active
metabolites) for its receptor (18). benzodiazepines
are classiﬁed as low, medium (e.g. clorazepate and
diazepam) or high (e.g. clonazepam and lorazepam) potency (18, 19).
benzodiazepine pharmacokinetics

benzodiazepines have diﬀerences in their physiochemical properties, most notably lipid solubility,
which inﬂuence their rate of absorption and
diﬀusion into tissue compartments and their pharmacokinetics. each  xxxd1459xxx  has a unique pharmacokinetic proﬁle that must be considered when the
optimal agent is selected for a particular patient
and condition. key factors to consider include

route of administration, rate and extent of absorption, metabolism, formation of active metabolites,
elimination and drug interactions (20).
absorption and distribution

when orally administered, most bzds are extensively and rapidly absorbed, with bioavailabilities
varying from 80% to 100% and times to peak
concentration ranging from minutes to several hours
(table 1). midazolam is an exception, with low oral
bioavailability due to metabolism by cytochrome
p-450 (cyp) enzyme 3a5 in intestinal epithelial
tissue, which can reduce by up to 50% the fraction of
the dose reaching the bloodstream (24). benzodiazepines cross the blood–brain barrier rapidly,
although the diffusion rate into the brain varies by
drug and is largely determined by lipophilicity (21).
the faster the diffusion rate, the earlier is the onset of
pharmacodynamic effects. rapid entry of bzds
into the cns and highly perfused tissues is consistent with their short distribution half-lives (21, 25).
following rapid uptake, bzds redistribute into less
well-perfused tissues; the rate of redistribution is the
fastest for the most lipid-soluble drugs (25). after an
intravenous (i.v.)  xxxd1459xxx  administration,  xxxd1459xxx  pharmacokinetics can be characterized by a multicompartmental mathematical model, with the ﬁrst phase
being distribution, followed by a longer elimination
phase. benzodiazepines also have large volumes of
distribution, are highly bound to plasma proteins
(table 1) and readily cross into the placenta and
breast milk (25).

metabolism and elimination

benzodiazepines diﬀer in their rates of elimination
and the formation of pharmacologically active
metabolites (table 2). the elimination half-life
(t1 ⁄ 2) of a  xxxd1459xxx  or of its active metabolite is used
to categorize  xxxd1459xxx  duration of effect: short acting
(<10 h; lorazepam, midazolam), intermediate
acting (10–24 h; clonazepam) or long acting
(>24 h;  xxxd1718xxx , clorazepate and diazepam) (43).
benzodiazepine metabolism is primarily catalyzed by cyp-dependent hydroxylation, demethylation and nitroreduction (26, 44, 45). the cyp
isoenzymes catalyzing these reactions include 3a4,
3a5, 2b6, 2c9 and 2c19 (tables 2 and 3). uridine
diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase is also
involved in the conjugation of some bzds (table 3).
several bzds have active metabolites. diazepam
and clorazepate are metabolized into the long-acting
metabolite dmd (56). with multiple doses, the
pharmacologic and toxic effects of diazepam are
attributable to the parent drug, dmd, and other
minor active metabolites (i.e. temazepam and oxazepam) (24). by contrast, clorazepate undergoes rapid
and complete chemical conversion to dmd in the
gastrointestinal tract; its pharmacologic effects are
largely due to dmd (24, 56). n-desmethyldiazepam
undergoes glucuronidation to form a glucuronide
conjugate (25%) and is hydroxylated (50%) by cyp
2c19 and cyp 3a4 to form oxazepam (24, 37).
approximately 5–9% of dmd is excreted
unchanged in the urine (24). the t1 ⁄ 2 of dmd
ranges widely from 20 to 179 h (24, 33, 34, 38).
other bzds also have pharmacologically active
metabolites.  xxxd1718xxx  is demethylated into an
active metabolite (n-desmethylclobazam) (27).
midazolam is rapidly converted by cyp 3a4 and
cyp 3a5 to 1-hydroxymidazolam, which contributes approximately 10% to the biologic activity of
its parent drug (24, 41). clonazepam and lorazepam undergo extensive metabolism, but no active
metabolites are formed (18, 24).
eﬀects of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
on  xxxd1459xxx  use – the diﬀerences in  xxxd1459xxx  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics must be considered
in order to use these drugs safely and eﬀectively.
equivalent doses of bzds diﬀer as much as 20-fold
because of diﬀerences in potency (57). the intensity
of single-dose effects may vary, even if equipotent
doses are used, because of varying oral absorption
rates (58). duration of action should be considered
when choosing a  xxxd1459xxx . when maintenance therapy
is required (e.g. epilepsy and anxiety), long-acting
bzds are preferred because of their prolonged t1 ⁄ 2,
as effective drug concentrations can be maintained

without the need for frequent dosing (56). shortacting bzds are preferred for intermittent hypnotic therapy, when the duration of action of the
drug should be restricted to night-time, allowing
patients to awaken feeling refreshed, without
hangover effects (56).
drug–drug interactions

benzodiazepines interact with other drugs such as
certain antidepressants, aeds (e.g. phenobarbital,
72

phenytoin and carbamazepine), sedative antihistamines, opiates, antipsychotics and alcohol (44, 57,
59), which may result in additive sedative effects.
as discussed earlier,  xxxd1459xxx  metabolism is complex and largely catalyzed by cyp isoenzymes.
consequently, there is potential for interactions
between bzds and drugs that induce or inhibit
cyp isoenzymes. the clinical importance of these
interactions depends on the net eﬀect of inhibition
or induction on the metabolic pathway of a
particular  xxxd1459xxx . for example, inhibition of a
minor pathway may have little impact on drug
concentration, whereas inhibition of a major
pathway may result in enhanced clinical eﬀect or
toxicity. by contrast, addition of an enzymeinducing drug that aﬀects even a relatively minor
pathway may lead to a clinically important reduction in plasma  xxxd1459xxx  concentration. for bzds with
active metabolites, the addition of an inhibitor or
inducer may aﬀect only the parent drug, only the
metabolite, or both. clinicians should exercise
particular caution when using bzds with selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, cimetidine, macrolide antibiotics and antimycotics; these drugs may
inhibit reactions catalyzed by certain cyp isoenzymes and, therefore, inhibit the metabolism of
many bzds, which results in increased plasma
 xxxd1459xxx  concentrations (44). conversely, potent
enzyme inducers (e.g. phenytoin, phenobarbital
and carbamazepine) substantially increase clearance and reduce the t1 ⁄ 2 of certain bzds (44). for
a detailed review of pharmacokinetic drug interactions involving bzds, see tanaka (44).
oral contraceptive steroids may inhibit the
metabolism of some bzds that undergo oxidative
metabolism or nitroreduction and accelerate
the metabolism of some bzds that are conjugated.
interactions between bzds and oral contraceptives
are described in detail by back and orme (60).

benzodiazepines in the treatment of epilepsy
special populations

special formulations of bzds

elderly patients – pharmacokinetics in older individuals diﬀer from those in younger individuals
because of age-related changes in physiology and the
likelihood of concurrent diseases. elderly individuals often have variable drug absorption, decreased
plasma protein–drug binding due to lower albumin
concentrations, and reduced hepatic and renal
clearance (61). additionally, many elderly individuals take multiple medications, which increase their
risk of drug–drug interactions. therefore, treatment
of the elderly can be challenging.
increased sensitivity of older patients to bzds is
partly due to reduced drug metabolism (when
compared with younger adults), which can result in
drug accumulation (62). furthermore,  xxxd1459xxx  pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly
patients than in younger patients even at similar
plasma  xxxd1459xxx  concentrations (63, 64), possibly
because of age-related changes in drug–receptor
interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ
function. when a  xxxd1459xxx  is prescribed for an elderly
patient, the initial maintenance dose should be half
that recommended for younger adults (57), and
 xxxd1459xxx  use should be only short term (limited to
2 weeks) (65). a short-acting  xxxd1459xxx  may be preferable for treating an elderly patient because such a
drug is better tolerated than is a  xxxd1459xxx  or  xxxd1459xxx 
active metabolite with a long t1 ⁄ 2 (64).

extended-release drug formulations can help
patients with epilepsy achieve their primary treatment goals of controlling seizures while reducing
side eﬀects by minimizing ﬂuctuations in drug
concentration and by improving compliance.
extended-release formulations may also improve
quality of life and patient satisfaction with
treatment, in part by simplifying dosage regimens
(70). currently, clorazepate is the only  xxxd1459xxx 
available in both a sustained-release, single-dose
(tranxene-sd, ovation pharmaceuticals, deerﬁeld, il, usa) formulation (11.25- and 22.5-mg
tablets) and an immediate-release formulation that
requires multiple doses per day (tranxene t-tab;
3.75-, 7.5- and 15-mg tablets) that is approved in
the usa for the treatment of seizures. some bzds
are also available as oral liquids [diazepam ( xxxd1866xxx ; 5 mg ⁄ ml), lorazepam (lorazepam
 xxxd122xxx ; 2 mg ⁄ ml) and midazolam (generic only;
2 mg ⁄ ml)], disintegrating tablets [clonazepam
(klonopin wafer; roche pharmaceuticals,
nutley, nj, usa; 0.125-, 0.25-, 0.5-, 1- and 2-mg
tablets)] or a rectal gel [diazepam ( xxxd1866xxx 
acudial; valeant pharmaceuticals international,
costa mesa, ca, usa; 2.5-, 10- and 20-mg
delivery systems)].

pediatric patients – limited information is available
regarding  xxxd1459xxx  absorption in children. often,
before children are administered medications, the
tablet is crushed or the capsule is opened, and the
contents are mixed with food or drink. food and
beverages may aﬀect  xxxd1459xxx  bioavailability, but
studies investigating this issue in children are
lacking.
drug metabolism is variable in children and
depends on the biotransformation pathway. cytochrome p-450-catalyzed metabolism tends to be
low at birth, but exceeds adult values by age
2–3 years; thereafter, cyp-catalyzed metabolism
decreases, reaching adult levels around puberty
(66). metabolism via glucuronidation tends to be
low in neonates, reaching adult levels by age
3–4 years (66). in neonates, the t1 ⁄ 2 of clorazepate
is prolonged and clearance is decreased (67).
infants have reduced hydroxylation metabolism,
which results in a decreased clearance of diazepam
(68). the t1 ⁄ 2 of midazolam is shorter in children
than in adults: 0.79–2.83 h in children (69) vs 1.36–
4 h in adults (24). clinicians should consider how
patient age may affect  xxxd1459xxx  clearance, because
clearance will affect  xxxd1459xxx  dosing.

eﬀect of extended-release formulations on plasma
 xxxd1459xxx  concentrations: pharmacokinetic simulations
with clorazepate – our group has performed simulation studies of plasma dmd concentrations over
time to investigate diﬀerences between clorazepate
formulations and to characterize the eﬀect of
missed doses with or without replacement doses
under steady-state conditions when using the
sustained-release and immediate-release formulations (71). these simulations were brieﬂy described
by kaplan and dupont (72), but detailed results
are reported herein. the following simulations
were performed for both formulations using
winnonlin (pharsight corporation, version 4.1:
mountain view, ca, usa) software and a twocompartment, ﬁrst-order, oral-absorption pharmacokinetic model: (1) steady-state conditions, (2)
missed dose(s) without replacement and (3) missed
dose(s) with replacement at the next scheduled
dose. the following dosing schedules for the
sustained-release and immediate-release formulations were entered to attain steady-state conditions
(>7 days): clorazepate sustained-release 22.5 mg –
one tablet orally every 24 h for 20 days; and
clorazepate immediate-release 7.5 mg – one tablet
orally three times daily (given 6 h apart) for
20 days. the resulting simulated plasma dmd

the mean steady-state plasma dmd concentration
was approximately 0.71 lg ⁄ ml for the immediaterelease formulation and 0.73 lg ⁄ ml for the sustained-release formulation. the time to maximum
concentration was 2.43 and 9.20 h for the immediate-release and sustained-release formulations
respectively. table 4 shows the effects of missed

(141.2%) with replacement of the missed dose
(table 4).
despite the long half-life of dmd, a missed
dayõs dosing can result in altered peak-to-trough
concentration ratios. overall, the diﬀerences
between peak and trough plasma dmd concentrations after a missed daily dose of clorazepate
increased more with the immediate-release formulation than with the sustained-release formulation
(table 4). there was little difference between the
two formulations in peak and trough concentrations following a missed dayõs dose. although the
effect was modest, the sustained-release tablet
maintained higher trough concentrations after a
missed daily dose and replacement of the missed
dose. this effect may prevent breakthrough seizures in some patients. additionally, when a
missed daily dose was replaced, the sustainedrelease formulation resulted in a smaller change in
peak concentrations, which may reduce the risk of
drug toxicity.

benzodiazepines are among the most useful aeds
available for treating status epilepticus and acute
repetitive seizures and for febrile seizure prophylaxis. benzodiazepines were used in epilepsy management as early as 1965, when gastaut et al. (73,
74) administered i.v. diazepam to treat status
epilepticus. since then, several other bzds have
been used for a variety of seizure disorders
(table 5).
several randomized controlled trials support the
use of bzds (particularly diazepam and loraze-

pam) as initial drug therapy in patients with status
epilepticus (77–80). intermittent use of bzds is
especially suitable for patients with clusters of
repetitive seizures (81). fewer studies have evaluated the clinical efﬁcacy of bzds in chronic
epilepsy. nevertheless, bzds are useful as adjunctive agents in treating certain patients with both
partial and primary generalized seizures (81).
benzodiazepines are versatile drugs that can be
employed in a variety of clinical settings because of
their broad spectrum of activity and multiple
formulations and because they can be administered
by several routes (81).
diazepam – diazepam is a drug of ﬁrst choice for
treatment of early status epilepticus and acute
repetitive seizures and for febrile seizure prophylaxis. it can be administered as an i.v. bolus, as a
continuous infusion, or rectally, which enhances its

utility in managing seizure emergencies. four
randomized controlled trials support diazepam as
a drug of ﬁrst choice for managing status epilepticus (77–80). success rates of i.v. diazepam for
treating status epilepticus vary. in a randomized
double-blind study comparing diazepam and
lorazepam, leppik et al. (80) found that 76% of
status epilepticus episodes (25 of 33) were terminated by one or two diazepam doses (5 mg ⁄ min).
in a randomized, non-blinded trial of patients
>15 years of age with status epilepticus, shaner
et al. (78) reported that seizures were aborted in
<10 min in 55.6% of patients (10 of 18) treated
with diazepam (2 mg ⁄ min) and phenytoin
(40 mg ⁄ min). a randomized, double-blind, multicenter veterans affairs cooperative study was
designed to compare the effectiveness of four
treatments for overt or subtle status epilepticus
(79). three hundred eighty-four patients with overt
75

riss et al.
status epilepticus and 134 patients with subtle
status epilepticus were randomly assigned to
receive either diazepam (0.15 mg ⁄ kg) followed
by phenytoin (18 mg ⁄ kg), lorazepam (0.1 mg ⁄ kg)
alone, phenobarbital (15 mg ⁄ kg) alone or
phenytoin (18 mg ⁄ kg) alone. treatment with diazepam plus phenytoin was successful in 55.8% of
patients (53 of 95) with overt status epilepticus and
8.3% of patients (three of 36) with subtle status
epilepticus (79). alldredge et al. (77) conducted a
randomized double-blind trial to determine the
effectiveness of i.v. diazepam, lorazepam and
placebo on status epilepticus when the drugs were
administered by paramedics before patients arrived
at the hospital. they found that status epilepticus
was terminated by the time of arrival in the
emergency department in 42.6% of the 68 patients
treated with one or two 5-mg doses of i.v.
diazepam (infused over 1–2 min). limited published data indicate that continuous i.v. infusions
of diazepam are safe and effective (82–84).
use of i.v. diazepam can result in seizure relapse
within 2 h of a single injection in approximately
50% of patients (76). therefore, multiple injections
or continuous infusion may be required, which can
lead to drug accumulation and possibly to acute
respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension
(76). the development of tolerance has also been
reported for infusions lasting >24 h (85). recommended dosing guidelines for i.v. diazepam for
convulsive status epilepticus are 0.15–0.25 mg ⁄ kg in
adults and 0.1–1.0 mg ⁄ kg in children (86). in
placebo-controlled trials, rectal diazepam gel
(doses of 0.2–0.5 mg ⁄ kg) reduced seizure recurrence
in children, adolescents and adults who had clusters
of repetitive seizures in a non-medical or home
setting (87–90). rectally administered diazepam
may also be effective for short-term prophylaxis
(at doses of 5–10 mg or 0.3–0.6 mg ⁄ kg in patients
weighing <10 kg) in children prone to febrile
seizures (91–93), and higher doses of rectal diazepam
(20–30 mg) have been used in adult patients with
drug-resistant epilepsy who are prone to serial
seizures (94, 95). use of oral diazepam is not
recommended for long-term epilepsy treatment (76).
lorazepam – lorazepam is generally given as an i.v.
bolus at doses of 0.05–0.1 mg ⁄ kg over 2 min, and
the dose may be repeated in 10 min. the i.v.
formulation is approved by the us food and
drug administration (fda) for the treatment of
status epilepticus. results from four comparative
studies (three of blinded design) have suggested that
lorazepam is superior to phenytoin and as eﬀective
as clonazepam, diazepam or the combination of
diazepam and phenytoin in the initial treatment of

76

status epilepticus (77, 79, 80, 96). in the previously
mentioned study by alldredge et al. (77), i.v.
lorazepam (2 mg, one to two doses) administered
to 66 adults with repetitive or ongoing generalized
seizures lasting >5 min terminated convulsions by
the time of arrival at the emergency department in
59.1% of patients. similarly, leppik et al. (80)
found that one or two lorazepam doses (4 mg each)
terminated seizures in 89% of status epilepticus
episodes. in the veterans affairs cooperative study
of status epilepticus, lorazepam terminated seizures
in 64.9% of patients and was signiﬁcantly more
effective than phenytoin (p = 0.002) (79). a nonblinded trial by sorel et al. (96) compared i.v.
lorazepam (4–10 mg, one to two doses) and clonazepam (1 mg, one to two doses) in 61 patients. in
lorazepam-treated patients, 53.0% had ‡75%
improvement, as did 39.6% of clonazepam-treated
patients, as measured by electroencephalograms.
clinical results were comparable between groups,
with 67.9% of lorazepam-treated patients and
69.0% of clonazepam-treated patients having
‡75% improvement. large lorazepam doses (0.3–
9 mg ⁄ h) have been used as an alternative to pentobarbital for treating refractory status epilepticus; for
all nine cases in an open-label study, lorazepam
terminated status epilepticus (97).
clinical studies in children have been mostly
unblinded and have included retrospective and
prospective designs. in a prospective open-label
study, appleton et al. (98) compared i.v. or rectal
lorazepam and diazepam treatments in 86 children.
a single dose terminated seizures in 76% of
patients treated with lorazepam and in 51% of
patients treated with diazepam; the difference
between treatments was not statistically signiﬁcant.
qureshi et al. (99) performed a comparative audit
of i.v. lorazepam and diazepam. the authors
suggested that lorazepam is probably as effective
as diazepam is for stopping acute seizures in
children. seizures were controlled within 15 min
in 65% of diazepam-treated patients (11 of 17)
(median time, 3 min) and in 65% of lorazepamtreated patients (20 of 31) (median time, 5 min).
the eﬀectiveness of lorazepam in the treatment
of patients with chronic epilepsy has been evaluated in relatively few studies (100). in a short-term,
placebo-controlled trial, adjunctive oral lorazepam
therapy was effective (i.e. reduced seizure frequency signiﬁcantly more than placebo did,
p < 0.01) for treating partial seizures that were
unresponsive to standard aeds (101).
clonazepam – as reviewed by browne (102), clonazepam has been shown to be efﬁcacious in
treating patients with both partial and generalized

benzodiazepines in the treatment of epilepsy
seizures. clonazepam is used primarily as an
adjunctive therapy to treat patients with a wide
range of treatment-resistant primary and secondarily generalized seizures (103). during the 1970s
and 1980s, the use of adjunctive clonazepam was
evaluated in a few, mostly small, controlled clinical
trials in patients with partial and generalized
seizures that were refractory to standard treatments (76, 104). uncontrolled studies of clonazepam in patients with partial and generalized
epilepsy have generally shown modest effects (76).
in generalized epilepsies, clonazepam is effective
for treating patients with absence seizures (105,
106). in one study, 70% of children with absence
seizures treated with clonazepam (seven of 10) had
a ‡ 75% reduction in seizure frequency after
8 weeks of treatment, and an additional 10% of
children (one of 10) had a 30% reduction in seizure
frequency (105). clonazepam also can be useful in
treating patients with myoclonic seizures (107). it is
considered the drug of choice in certain rare
childhood epilepsy syndromes (108). it is also
effective in controlling status epilepticus; a review
of several studies (109–120) of i.v. clonazepam use
in status epilepticus found the drug to be effective
in approximately 80–90% of patients (107). clonazepam has been shown to be effective as
adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures,
absence seizures, tonic–clonic seizures and myoclonic seizures (121, 122).
midazolam – midazolam is the only available
water-soluble  xxxd1459xxx ; solubility is achieved when
the injectable solution is buﬀered to a ph of 2.9–
3.7 (123). in the treatment of status epilepticus,
midazolam can be administered by i.v. bolus,
continuous i.v. infusion or i.m. injection. it can
also be administered buccally or nasally (124, 125).
rectal administration is not recommended because
of poor bioavailability (126). although it is used
for many seizure types, midazolam does not have
an fda-approved indication for seizures.
clinical experience with midazolam for treating
status epilepticus (as initial treatment or for
refractory status epilepticus) is limited (76). in
three controlled clinical trials, the efﬁcacy of
intranasal midazolam was similar to or better
than that of i.v. or rectal diazepam (124, 127, 128).
midazolam has also been found to be safe and
effective when administered as a continuous infusion to treat refractory generalized convulsive
status epilepticus (129–133). in a randomized trial
comparing buccal midazolam with rectal diazepam
in children, the drugs showed similar efﬁcacy and
onset of action (125). in that study, seizure
cessation was achieved in 75% of cases (30 of 40)

with midazolam and in 59% of cases (23 of 39)
with diazepam treatment (p = 0.16). results from
another randomized controlled trial that compared
buccal midazolam with rectal diazepam for emergency treatment of seizures in children suggested
that midazolam was more eﬀective than diazepam
(134). therapeutic success (deﬁned as cessation of
visible signs of seizure activity within 10 min of
drug administration, lack of respiratory depression
and no further seizures within 1 h) was noted in
56% of midazolam-treated patients (61 of 109) and
27% of diazepam-treated patients (30 of 110), a
29% difference between groups; (95% conﬁdence
interval, 16–41%). open-label studies have suggested that intranasal midazolam is safe and
effective for acute seizure management in children
(124, 127, 128, 135, 136). in a prospective,
randomized, open-label study, intranasal midazolam was as safe and effective as i.v. diazepam was
for managing febrile seizures, with 88% of seizures
(23 of 26) responding to initial treatment with
midazolam and 92% (24 of 26) responding to
diazepam (124). intranasal midazolam takes less
time to administer than i.v. diazepam does but has
disadvantages. often, the parenteral formulation
has been used for intranasal administration. a
large volume is required to deliver a therapeutic
dose, making administration difﬁcult because
much of the solution may leak out of the nose or
be swallowed (137). additionally, pain is common
with intranasal midazolam administration, which
may indicate irritation of the nasal mucosa due to
the low ph (3–4.3) of the formulation (137–139).
finally, the short t1 ⁄ 2 of midazolam (24) may put
patients at risk of seizure recurrence as plasma
concentrations rapidly decline.
 xxxd1718xxx  – although not currently approved in
the usa,  xxxd1718xxx  is commonly used elsewhere as
adjunctive therapy for patients with refractory
epilepsy (103). it is highly effective as adjunctive
therapy for partial and generalized seizures, for
intermittent therapy and for controlling nonconvulsive status epilepticus, and it produces less
sedation than other bzds do (140). its use is
limited by the potential for the development of
tolerance. however, a portion of patients (up to
25%) may remain seizure free while taking adjunctive  xxxd1718xxx  for long periods (141–144). the
canadian  xxxd1718xxx  cooperative group reported
that, on the basis of results from a retrospective
study, 40–50% of patients could be maintained on
 xxxd1718xxx  for 4 years or longer (141).
in several double-blind, placebo-controlled,
add-on trials in patients with refractory epilepsy,
adjunctive  xxxd1718xxx  was shown to be eﬀective

77

riss et al.
(17, 145–152). in a crossover study of 21 patients,
a >50% reduction in seizure frequency was
seen in 52% of patients receiving  xxxd1718xxx  (145).
in another crossover study, schmidt et al. (146)
reported a seizure frequency reduction of ‡75% in
40% of patients receiving adjunctive  xxxd1718xxx .
these ﬁndings compare favorably with adjunctive
therapy results for many aeds currently available
in the usa.  xxxd1718xxx  was studied in a large
double-blind trial as ﬁrst-line monotherapy in
children with partial, partial with secondary generalization or primary generalized tonic–clonic
seizures and was reported to have efﬁcacy and
tolerability similar to that of monotherapy with
phenytoin or carbamazepine (153, 154). seizure
freedom was maintained for the entire 12 months
of the study for 23%, 25% and 11% of patients
randomly assigned to receive  xxxd1718xxx , carbamazepine and phenytoin respectively.
clorazepate – the eﬀectiveness of adjunctive clorazepate for various treatment-resistant seizures has
been demonstrated; however, the clinical experience and data available are less extensive for
clorazepate than for other bzds (103). an openlabel clinical study of clorazepate therapy suggested that the drug might be useful as an add-on
treatment for generalized major and minor seizures
(e.g. absence, akinetic and myoclonic) (155). in
that study, an excellent response (deﬁned as
complete seizure control or seizure control that
produced a notable improvement in social, educational or vocational assessment) was observed for
19% of patients with major generalized seizures
(three of 16), 39% of patients with absence seizures
(seven of 18), 33% of patients with akinetic
seizures (three of nine) and 57% of patients with
myoclonic seizures (four of seven). other doubleblind (156) and open-label (157–159) studies have
demonstrated the efﬁcacy of adjunctive clorazepate
for both partial (simple and complex) and generalized seizures.
clorazepate also appears to be useful in childhood epilepsy. in an open-label, add-on study,
22% of patients with lennox–gastaut syndrome
(two of nine) had a partial response (<75%
reduction in seizure frequency) to clorazepate
(158). in an uncontrolled, open-label study of 18
children with lennox–gastaut syndrome or other
conditions with atypical absence seizures, the
authors stated that ﬁve patients (28%) had an
excellent response and eight patients (44%) had a
good response to adjunctive clorazepate therapy,
although the terms ôexcellentõ and ôgoodõ were not
clearly deﬁned (160). other studies have found
good results with clorazepate in the treatment of

78

refractory childhood epilepsies. in an open-label
study by naidu et al. (161), 11 children with
generalized seizures (absence and atonic) who
received clorazepate as monotherapy (n = 4) or
as adjunctive therapy with valproate (n = 7) had a
reduction in the number of clinically observed
seizures. in another open-label study, clorazepate
was added to standard aeds in 29 children with
various seizure disorders; 72% of patients experienced improved seizure control (162).
adverse effects

although bzds as a class are well tolerated,
clinicians should be aware of potential safety issues
associated with  xxxd1459xxx  use. drowsiness and confusion may be indicative of over-sedation, a doserelated extension of the sedative ⁄ hypnotic eﬀects
of bzds (62, 163, 164). over-sedation is more
problematic in the elderly than in younger patients,
and it may occur at lower doses in the elderly (165,
166). elderly patients treated with bzds can
experience confusion, amnesia, ataxia and hangover effects (62). benzodiazepine use is also associated with falls, a possible result of over-sedation
in elderly patients (167).
benzodiazepines may cause amnesia, particularly anterograde amnesia (168). this effect is
sometimes deliberately utilized in presurgical medication (169). however, memory impairment may
also be associated with clinical doses of orally
administered bzds (168).
for individuals who use bzds long term, the
possible degree of recovery and the extent of
residual impairment that may remain after the
drugs are withdrawn are unclear (170). in a metaanalysis, barker et al. (170) concluded that longterm  xxxd1459xxx  users show recovery of function in
visuospatial skills, attention ⁄ concentration, general intelligence, psychomotor speed and nonverbal memory assessments after withdrawal. the
authors found, however, that signiﬁcant cognitive
impairment was more persistent in long-term users
than in control groups or in normative data. the
authors reported that the study data did not
demonstrate complete restoration of function
within the ﬁrst 6 months following discontinuation
of  xxxd1459xxx  use; they suggested that longer than
6 months may be needed for recovery from some
deﬁcits.
paradoxical excitement is sometimes associated
with  xxxd1459xxx  use and may include exacerbation of
seizures in patients with epilepsy (171). children
and elderly patients, patients with a history of
alcohol abuse and individuals with a history of
aggressive behavior ⁄ anger may be more likely to

benzodiazepines in the treatment of epilepsy
experience paradoxical excitement effects than are
other patients (172). additionally, bzds can cause
or aggravate depression (57).
dependence refers to the compulsion to take a
drug to produce a desired eﬀect or to prevent
unpleasant eﬀects that occur when the drug is
withheld. dependence develops in almost onethird of patients who are treated with bzds for
‡4 weeks (173). a withdrawal syndrome upon  xxxd1459xxx 
discontinuation (see tolerance and withdrawal
section) is a common manifestation of  xxxd1459xxx  dependence (173). high  xxxd1459xxx  dosage and potency, short
duration of  xxxd1459xxx  action, long duration of therapy
and premorbid dependent personality traits are risk
factors for the development of  xxxd1459xxx  dependence
(173). potent bzds with relatively short t1 ⁄ 2 (e.g.
triazolam, alprazolam and lorazepam) appear to
carry the highest risk of dependence (173).
substantial diﬀerences in adverse event occurrences associated with the bzds proﬁled here have
not been reported in large randomized, controlled
trials comparing bzds. some study results have
suggested that diazepam may have greater eﬀects on
respiratory depression than are observed with other
bzds such as lorazepam and midazolam (174, 175).
additionally, although bzds are generally known
to affect memory, some studies have shown that
effects differ depending on the  xxxd1459xxx  used. lorazepam appears to impair both explicit memory and
implicit memory, and although diazepam impairs
explicit memory, results regarding impairment of
implicit memory by diazepam are mixed (176–179).
the adverse event proﬁles of bzds should be
considered when decisions are made regarding
therapy. clinicians should weigh the possible
beneﬁts of therapy with bzds against the potential
adverse eﬀects.

tolerance and withdrawal
tolerance

tolerance to aeds is associated with a progressive
increase in the number and severity of seizures and
an increased risk of withdrawal seizures in the
presence of a constant maintenance dose. tolerance to several bzds has been demonstrated in
experimental epilepsy models (180–185). because
of the development of anticonvulsant tolerance,
bzds are generally considered unsuitable for longterm control of epilepsy (57, 186). increasing the
 xxxd1459xxx  dose may overcome anticonvulsant tolerance.
however, tolerance may recur at the higher dose,
and adverse effects may persist or worsen.
cross-tolerance between bzds occurs and
appears to be drug speciﬁc. ramsey-williams

et al. (187) demonstrated that after 3 weeks of
diazepam treatment, rats developed cross-tolerance
to the anticonvulsant effects of  xxxd1718xxx , clonazepam and midazolam. rats treated with midazolam
for 3 weeks developed cross-tolerance to diazepam
but not to  xxxd1718xxx  or clonazepam. the authors
suggested that differences in tolerance and crosstolerance could result from differential regulation
of receptor subunit expression by each drug and
from differences between the drugs in their interactions with receptors at the time of testing.
when bzds are used as anticonvulsants, the
time to onset of tolerance varies, and the
potential of a  xxxd1459xxx  to induce anticonvulsant
tolerance does not appear to have any relationship with its chemical or pharmacokinetic properties (188). differences in the development of
anticonvulsant tolerance have been reported for
various bzds in an amygdala-kindling rat
model. young et al. (185) found that tolerance
to  xxxd1718xxx  developed within 3 days of initial
drug exposure, whereas tolerance to clonazepam
developed gradually over the course of a 19-day
study. rosenberg et al. (189) compared the
anticonvulsant activity of clonazepam,  xxxd1718xxx 
and diazepam in rats and found that tolerance
developed most rapidly to  xxxd1718xxx  and most
slowly to clonazepam.
in studies investigating anticonvulsant tolerance,
animals treated with clorazepate exhibited a later
onset or a lesser degree of tolerance than did those
treated with either diazepam (190–192) or clonazepam (184, 192). nonetheless, clinicians must be
aware of the possibility of tolerance with long-term
clorazepate administration. in a study comparing
clorazepate and  xxxd1718xxx , tolerance was deﬁned as
initial seizure freedom, marked efﬁcacy (‡80%
seizure frequency reduction) or efﬁcacy (‡50%
seizure frequency reduction) followed by an
increase in seizure frequency to a level greater
than that seen with initial treatment. tolerance
occurred in 48% of patients treated with clorazepate for ‡4 weeks, but in only 24% of patients
treated with  xxxd1718xxx  for ‡3 months (193). however, when the dosage was maintained or
increased, clorazepate once again became effective
in 50% of patients who had previously developed
tolerance. likewise, in 70% of patients who had
developed tolerance to  xxxd1718xxx , the drug once
again became effective with an increased dosage or
at the same dosage. the mechanism responsible for
such reversal of tolerance is unclear.
tolerance to some side eﬀects of bzds can also
develop. the onset of tolerance to the sedative
eﬀects of bzds usually occurs within 1–2 weeks
(194, 195). memory and cognition, however, often
79

riss et al.
remain impaired in patients on long-term  xxxd1459xxx 
therapy without full recovery (57, 196).
the diﬀerences in time to onset of tolerance to
the various pharmacologic eﬀects of bzds suggest
that diﬀerent mechanisms may be involved (197).
one putative mechanism for the development of
tolerance is simple down-regulation of gaba
receptors in response to prolonged  xxxd1459xxx  exposure;
however, studies testing this hypothesis have
reported mixed results (197). li et al. (198) suggested that down-regulation of  xxxd1459xxx  receptor
binding sites could not fully explain the development of tolerance because tolerance to some bzds
has been observed even when no changes in bzdreceptor binding were noted (187).
several other mechanisms for  xxxd1459xxx  tolerance
have been proposed on the basis of animal and cell
culture models. these processes include uncoupling
of allosteric linkage between gaba and  xxxd1459xxx 
sites, changes in the turnover of receptor subunits
and changes in receptor gene expression (197).
considering the evidence that tolerance to the
various behavioral effects of bzds develops at
different rates and that behavioral effects of bzds
are mediated by different gabaa receptor subtypes, bateson (197) proposed that multiple mechanisms mediate tolerance and dependence. he
described a uniﬁed model of molecular mechanisms underlying tolerance that incorporates the
molecular processes discussed above. this model
assumes that initial potentiation of the gaba
response leads to desensitization and that prolonged desensitization could result in uncoupling
(as either a signal for or a consequence of receptor
internalization, i.e. endocytosis). subsequent to
receptor internalization, degradation of certain
receptor subunits could provide a signal for
changes in gabaa receptor gene transcription.
depending on the receptor subtypes involved, as
well as the brain region and neuronal cell types,
this model could account for the temporal differences in the development of tolerance to the
different effects of bzds.
the reason for diﬀerences in time to tolerance
between the various bzds is not entirely clear. the
slow onset of tolerance to the anticonvulsant eﬀect
of clorazepate could be due to a low degree of
intrinsic activity of dmd at the  xxxd1459xxx  receptor.
gobbi et al. (199) demonstrated that diazepam and
dmd have the same afﬁnity for the central type of
 xxxd1459xxx  receptors, but when the intrinsic activity of
dmd was calculated, it proved to be a partial
agonist, with intrinsic activity approximately 43%
that of diazepam.
clinicians should consider the possibility of
tolerance when evaluating response to  xxxd1459xxx  ther80

apy. although tolerance may develop more rapidly
to some bzds than to others, it is important to
note that tolerance generally renders bzds unsuitable for long-term control of epilepsy.
withdrawal

when  xxxd1459xxx  therapy is discontinued, patients may
experience recurrence of their original symptoms,
rebound (appearance of original symptoms, but at
a more intense level) or withdrawal (appearance of
new symptoms that were not present before treatment). withdrawal symptoms from bzds range
from mild (e.g. insomnia and anxiety) to severe
(e.g. seizures and psychosis). distinguishing
between symptoms of withdrawal and return of
the patientõs original symptoms may be diﬃcult.
numerous reports have identiﬁed certain predictors of the occurrence or increased severity of
withdrawal symptoms: higher  xxxd1459xxx  dose (200–
204), longer duration of  xxxd1459xxx  use (202, 203, 205,
206), immediate cessation or rapid tapering of the
 xxxd1459xxx  dose (200, 203, 204, 207–209), history of drug
abuse (202, 203), dependence on other drugs (209),
personality pathology (e.g. neuroticism and dependency) (203) and a diagnosis of panic disorder (203).
a number of studies have investigated withdrawal
symptoms associated with the bzds reviewed
herein. some reports have suggested that  xxxd1459xxx  t1 ⁄ 2
does not inﬂuence withdrawal symptoms (208, 210).
however, results from other studies have suggested
that, compared with long-t1 ⁄ 2 bzds, bzds with
short t1 ⁄ 2 are associated with faster onset of withdrawal symptoms or more severe withdrawal symptoms when  xxxd1459xxx  therapy is stopped abruptly (211,
212). in a meta-analysis of seven studies, hallfors
and saxe (213) found that patients treated with
short-t1 ⁄ 2 bzds were more likely to experience
rebound anxiety than were patients treated with
long-t1 ⁄ 2 bzds. additionally, rebound anxiety was
noted to develop more rapidly in patients treated
with short-t1 ⁄ 2 bzds than in patients treated with
long-t1 ⁄ 2 bzds. finally, results from sleep laboratory studies suggest that rebound insomnia and
withdrawal symptoms are more likely to be associated with bzds that have a short or intermediate
t1 ⁄ 2 than with bzds that have a longer t1 ⁄ 2, such as
diazepam (214).
conclusions

benzodiazepines are indicated for the treatment of
seizure emergencies and epilepsy. they are among
the most useful aeds available for treating patients
with status epilepticus or acute repetitive seizures.
they have the clinical advantages of being highly

benzodiazepines in the treatment of epilepsy
eﬀective, with a rapid onset of action and relatively
low toxicity. benzodiazepines can be used in a
variety of clinical situations because they can be
administered by several routes and in diﬀerent
formulations. however, bzds have shortcomings.
tolerance may develop over time, making bzds
unsuitable for use in long-term epilepsy management. additionally, withdrawal symptoms, some
severe, may develop after cessation of  xxxd1459xxx  therapy.
other shortcomings include adverse events, such as
cognitive impairment and sedation, and drug interactions. clorazepate is unique among bzds in that
it is associated with slow onset of tolerance, its active
metabolite has a long t1 ⁄ 2, and it is available as a
sustained-release formulation, all of which may,
theoretically, help minimize adverse effects and
withdrawal symptoms. however, it is important to
note that the clinical experience and available data
are less extensive for clorazepate than for other
bzds. studies of clorazepate in patients with
epilepsy have mainly been small, open-label investigations. larger controlled studies are needed to
further examine the role of clorazepate in the
treatment of patients with epilepsy.
