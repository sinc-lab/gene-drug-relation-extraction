atp is a paracrine regulator of critical airway epithelial cell functions,
but the mechanism of its release is poorly understood. pannexin
(panx) proteins, related to invertebrate innexins, form channels
(called pannexons) that are able to release atp from several cell
types. thus, atp release via pannexons was examined in airway
epithelial cells. quantitative rt-pcr showed  xxxg1664xxx  expression in
normal human airway epithelial cells during redifferentiation at the
air–liquid interface (ali), at a level comparable to that of alveolar
macrophages; panx3 was not expressed. immunohistochemistry
showed  xxxg1664xxx  expression at the apical pole of airway epithelia. ali
cultures exposed to hypotonic stress released atp to an estimated
maximum of 255 (664) nm within 1 minute after challenge (n 5 6
cultures from three different lungs) or to approximately 1.5 (60.4)
mm, recalculated to a normal airway surface liquid volume. using
date- and culture-matched cells (each n > 16 from 4 different lungs),
the pannexon inhibitors  xxxd433xxx  (10 mm) and probenecid
(1 mm), but not the connexon inhibitor  xxxd2122xxx  (100 mm),
inhibited atp release by approximately 60%. the drugs affected
 xxxg1664xxx  currents in xenopus oocytes expressing exogenous  xxxg1664xxx 
correspondingly. in addition, suppression of  xxxg1664xxx  expression using
lentivirus-mediated production of shrna in differentiated airway
epithelial cells inhibited atp release upon hypotonic stress by
approximately 60% as well. these data not only show that  xxxg1664xxx  is
expressed apically in differentiated airway epithelial cells but also
that it contributes to atp release in these cells.

atp release onto the surface of airway epithelia is important for
the regulation of many cellular functions related to mucociliary
clearance (1–7), and atp concentrations at the apical surface can
reach micromolar concentrations, sufficient for atp signaling (8,
9). in addition to stimulated atp release, resting atp levels in
the low nanomolar range on the apical surface reflect a steady
state of atp secretion/release and atp metabolism. constitutive atp release has been calculated to be 20–200 fmol  min21 
cells26 (3, 10). a recent publication also provides a mathematical
model of the influences of nucleotides on mucociliary clearance
parameters that is based on measured data, again stressing the
importance of this paracrine mechanism for airway homeostasis
(11).
despite its importance and the scrutiny placed on it in many
cells and tissues, the mechanism of atp release onto airway
epithelia remains at least partially unknown. two distinct pathways have been proposed: a vesicular- and a channel-mediated
release. in support of a vesicular mechanism, atp release has

clinical relevance
 xxxg1664xxx  contributes to release of atp, an important
paracrine regulator of mucociliary function, in airway
epithelia. given the regulation of pannexins, the findings
described in this article may have important implications
for the availability of atp in the airway surface liquid in
airway homeostasis and disease.

been shown to partially depend on intracellular calcium increases
required for vesicular release. further support for this mechanism
comes from the fact that airway epithelial cells release uridine
diphosphate–glucose (12), presumably from vesicles stemming
from the endoplasmic reticulum where  xxxd3476xxx –
glucose plays a role in glycosylation by providing glucose for
glucosyl transferases. although this vesicular mechanism may
provide a vehicle for constitutive atp release, recent work on
airway epithelia shows that calcium is not needed for hypotonic
stress–mediated atp release (8).
as an alternative to vesicular atp release, several membrane
channels have been implicated. these include cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, connexins that form channels to the outside
(instead of gap junctions between cells), including  xxxg895xxx , cx38, and
cx32, a volume-regulated channel, the purinergic receptor, p2x7,
a voltage-dependent anion channel ( xxxg2409xxx ), a volume expansion–
sensing outward rectifier, and the maxi anion channel. published
data make it unlikely that most of these act as atp release
channels—at least not alone. for example, multiple articles have
ruled out cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator as a direct atp
release channel (3, 8, 13, 14). although  xxxg2409xxx  was found to
contribute to atp release from murine airway epithelial cells (15),
the plasma membrane variant of the channel does not exist in
human cells, and even the murine cells from  xxxg2409xxx –deficient
animals still released significant amounts of atp (15). most of the
properties of the maxi anion channel, specifically its high atp
permeability, are consistent with an atp release function (16, 17).
however, its exclusive anion selectivity disfavors such a role, as dye
uptake typically associated with atp release is seen with positively
charged dyes, such as yopro or ethidiumbromide.
channels formed by connexins to the outside of cells, called
connexons, seem important, because gap junction inhibitors
successfully interfere with atp release (e.g., ref. 18). in addition,
conditions that induce atp release are associated with uptake of
extracellular dyes that test gap junction function (for review, see
ref. 19). although connexins are unlikely to release atp (see
discussion), vertebrates express not only connexins, but also
orthologs of the invertebrate innexins, namely the pannexins
(panx). unlike connexons, pannexons (i.e., channels to the outside of cells) open at resting membrane potentials in response to
mechanical stress (20). when coexpressed with p2y receptors,
 xxxg1664xxx  channels open in response to extracellular atp that signals
via intracellular ca21 (21). thus, panx may participate in atp
release from airway epithelia. the data presented here reveal that
 xxxg1664xxx  is expressed at the apical membrane of airway epithelia,

and that pannexons contribute to atp release onto the apical
airway surface.

chemicals and solutions
unless stated otherwise, all materials were purchased from sigma
chemical co. (st. louis, mo).

cell cultures and alveolar macrophages
human airways were obtained from organ donors whose lungs were
rejected for transplant. consent for research was obtained by the life
alliance organ recovery agency of the university of miami. from
these lungs, airway epithelial cells were isolated and dedifferentiated
through expansion and redifferentiated at an air–liquid interface (ali)
on 12-mm t-clear filters (costar corning, corning, ny), as previously
described (22–25). all consents were institutional review board–
approved and conformed to the declaration of helsinki.
human alveolar macrophages were purified from donor lungs using
the method described by mackenzie and colleagues (26), except that
the cells were filtered through 70-mm sieves.

immunohistochemistry in oocytes (27) and brain from  xxxg1664xxx  knockout
mice (28).
after thorough washing with pbs-t, the sections were incubated
with fluorescein-labeled goat a-chicken igy (aves labs), at 1:1,000 for
1 hour at room temperature. tissues were mounted in ultracruz
mounting media (santa cruz biotechnology inc., santa cruz, ca).
photomicrographs were examined on a leica dmirb epifluorescent
inverted microscope (leica, bannockburn, il) at the analytical
imaging core, university of miami.
for immunolabeling of ali cultures for confocal imaging, filters
were washed three times with pbs and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
(pfa) for 1 hour. after fixing, filters were washed with pbs before
permeabilization in 100% meoh for 5 minutes at 2208c. next, filters
were treated three times with 5 mg/ml sodium borohydride. filters
were washed three times with pbs before blocking in 1% bsa for
1 hour. finally, filters were treated with anti- xxxg1664xxx  (1:100) overnight
at 48c, followed by fluorescein-labeled goat a-chicken igy (aves labs),
at 1:1,000 for 1 hours. sections were also probed with antiacetylated
tubulin (1:10,000) for 1 hour at room temperature. images were taken
on a zeiss lsm 510 confocal microscope (zeiss, thornwood, ny) at
the analytical imaging core, university of miami.

western blotting
rna extraction and quantitative rt-pcr
total rna was extracted from ali-cultured human airway epithelial
cells and from alveolar macrophages using the rneasy protect mini
kit (qiagen, valencia, ca), subsequently treated with dnase (dnase
i amplification grade; invitrogen, carlsbad, ca), and precipitated
with ethanol. the quality of isolated rna was confirmed with
a nanodrop (thermo fisher scientific inc., waltham, ma) using an
acceptable range of the 260:280 optical density ratio of between 1.9 and
2.0. reverse transcription was done using the iscript cdna synthesis
kit (bio-rad laboratories, inc., hercules, ca) with 1 mg of rna
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr) was performed using the iq
sybr green supermix and the icycler thermocycler iq multicolor
detection system (bio-rad laboratories). primer pairs were designed
using beacondesigner (premier biosoft, palo alto, ca). the following primer sequences were used for  xxxg1664xxx , panx2, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, respectively: forward, aga  xxxg873xxx

ctc ttc tcc ttc tcc; and forward, tgg tct cct ctg act
tca aca g, reverse, tgc tgt agc caa att cgt tgt c.
qpcr reactions were performed in a total reaction volume of 50 ml,
containing 1 ml of template, 25 ml of 23 iq sybr green supermix
(bio-rad laboratories), 250 nm primers, and ddh2o. thermal conditions were 958c for 3 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation
at 948c for 15 seconds, annealing at 578c for 30 seconds, and extension
at 728c for 30 seconds. in each qpcr run, a nontemplate control was
included to monitor possible contamination. data were evaluated using
the iq 5 software (bio-rad laboratories).
qpcr for panx3 mrna was done using taqman primers (assay
id hs00364808_m1; applied biosystems, foster city, ca).

immunohistochemistry
for immunohistochemistry, 8- to 10-mm paraffin-embedded sections
were deparaffinized with 100% xylene and rehydrated through a graded
alcohol series. after rinsing in pbs with 0.5% tween-20 (pbs-t), the
sections were heated to 858c in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer (ph 6.0)
for 25 minutes for antigen retrieval. sections were allowed to cool in
the citrate buffer at room temperature for 25 minutes before washing
in pbs-t. nonspecific labeling was blocked with preincubation
serum (1:10 blockhen in pbs-t) for 1 hour at room temperature
(aves labs, tigard, or). the slides were then incubated with either
nonimmune chicken serum or chicken a- xxxg1664xxx  (#4515), diluted
1:175 in blockhen:pbs-t (1:100) for 18 hours at 48c. this antibody
has been previously characterized to be specific for  xxxg1664xxx  (27), and is
a polyclonal chicken immunoglobulin raised against the amino acid
residues eknsrqrllnps in the human  xxxg1664xxx  c terminus (27). the
specificity of this antibody was characterized by western blotting and

ali-cultured human airway epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages
were solubilized in ripa buffer containing protease inhibitors, and
briefly cleared from debris by centrifugation. protein yield was
measured by the bca assay (pierce, rockford, il). proteins were
separated on a 4–20% precast ready gel (bio-rad laboratories) and
electroblotted onto immobilon-p membranes (millipore, billerica,
ma). load in each lane was 25 mg protein. membranes were blocked
with 1% gelatin in tris-buffered saline (ph 7.4) with 0.05% tween-20
(ttbs) for 1 hour at 48c. primary antibody was a rabbit anti- xxxg1664xxx 
antibody raised against a synthetic peptide derived from the c terminus
of the mouse  xxxg1664xxx  protein (catalog no. 488,100; zymed laboratories,
san francisco, ca) and used at 1 mg/ml in 1% gelatin-supplemented
ttbs for 1 hour at room temperature. secondary antibody was an
anti-rabbit, horseradish peroxidase–linked antibody (catalog no. 7074;
cell signaling, danvers, ma) used at 1:2,000 in ttbs for 1 hour at
room temperature. positive signals were visualized by chemiluminescence on a chemidoc xrs system (bio-rad laboratories) and
quantified using the quantityone software (bio-rad laboratories).

hypotonic stress–induced atp release assays
culture media in the basolateral compartment were replaced with
media containing treatment or vehicle, and the culture was allowed to
equilibrate for 2.5 hours at 378c. media were removed and the filters
transferred to a turner td 20/20 luminometer (turner biosystems,
sunnyvale, ca), where 26 ml of a luciferin (150 mm) and luciferase
(2.0 mg) solution, containing vehicle (0.01% dmso or control) or
treatment (100 mm  xxxd2122xxx  in dmso, 10 mm  xxxd433xxx 
[cbx] in dmso, or 1 mm probenecid), was gently added to the apical
compartment. the used concentrations of these drugs did not influence
the atp measurements, and were additionally controlled by using
comparison solutions with the same solvents (cbx versus flufenamic
acid [ffa], probenecid versus no-solvent control). the culture was
allowed to equilibrate for 10 minutes to re-establish basal conditions, at
which point (time 0), 15 ml of a hypotonic solution (h2o with 1 mm
cacl2 and 1 mm mgcl2), also containing vehicle or treatment, was
gently added to the apical compartment. this addition of 15 ml to the
26 ml already present on the apical surface caused a hypotonic stress
due to the solution now being 67% of normal osmolality (8). atp was
subsequently recorded in arbitrary light units (alu) every 0.2 seconds
for 5 minutes. atp concentrations were estimated using standard
curves with known atp concentrations.

electrophysiology
rna for mouse  xxxg1664xxx  was prepared using the mmessage mmachine
in vitro transcription kit (invitrogen) (20). oocytes were injected with
20–40 nl mrna (1 mg/ml) and incubated for 18–48 hours at 188c.
oocytes were tested using a two-electrode voltage clamp (model
oc725c; warner instruments, hamden, ct) under constant perfusion

according to the protocols described in the legend of figure 5.
membrane conductance was determined using voltage pulses. oocytes
expressing  xxxg1664xxx  were held at 250 mv, and pulses to 150 mv were
applied to transiently open the channels.

difference test using jmp software (sas institute, cary, nc) for
multiple groups or a t test for single pairs. a p value of less than 0.05
was accepted as significant. data are given as mean values (6sem).

shrna lentiviruses

results

five proviral plasmids (plko.1) with different anti- xxxg1664xxx  shrna
sequences were purchased from open biosystems, inc. (huntsville,
al). the plko.1 lentiviral vector contains a selectable marker for
resistance to  xxxd3041xxx . replication-deficient lentiviruses were prepared by cotransfecting vector and packaging dnas, pmdlg/
prre#54 prsv-rev and pmdlgvsvg, into hek 293t cells by
calcium phosphate coprecipitation, as previously described (25).
viruses were collected daily for 3 days beginning 24 hours after
removing the precipitates. viruses were concentrated by precipitation
with the addition of  xxxd2982xxx  to 11% and centrifugation.
virus titers were estimated by measuring p24 by elisa (perkinelmer, shelton, ct).
undifferentiated normal human bronchial epithelial (nhbe) cells
were infected as previously described (25). after infection, the cells
were fed bronchial epithelial growth medium (begm) for 24 hours and
then begm containing 1 mg/ml  xxxd3041xxx  to select for infected cells.

airway epithelium

statistical analysis
results were compared by one-way anova and, if a significant
difference was found, by the tukey-kramer honestly significant

 xxxg1664xxx , -2, and -3 expression was examined by quantitative rtpcr in a bio-rad icycler iq thermocycler and detection system
using rna from nhbe ali cultures and primers designed with
beacondesigner (premier biosoft) or taqman kits, as described
in materials and methods. denaturation curves and agarose gel
electrophoresis confirmed that single products of the predicted
sizes were amplified.  xxxg1664xxx  was expressed in all cultures examined (from nine individuals, each in triplicate; figure 1a). there
was no significant difference of expression between cells from
smokers (n 5 4) and nonsmokers (n 5 5; p . 0.05; figure 1).
 xxxg1664xxx  expression was present in nondifferentiated cells plated on
transwell membranes 1 day after switching to ali culture, and
no significant changes in mrna expression occurred throughout
differentiation (figure 1b), indicating that these genes are
constitutively expressed. even though panx2 does not form
channels by itself (29), and the evidence on panx3 is mixed, with

expressed as a percent of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ) expression. there
is no significant difference in mrna levels between
nonsmokers and smokers when cells are cultured at
the ali.  xxxg1664xxx  expression in alveolar macrophages
is about twice as high as in airway epithelia cells
(p , 0.05). panx3 is not detected (data not shown).

channel formation found only in cells overexpressing panx3 (30,
31), primary human airway epithelial cells were also found to
express low levels of panx2 (figure 1a), but not panx3 mrna
(data not shown).
alveolar macrophages also expressed  xxxg1664xxx  mrna, and
this expression was about twice that found in human airway
epithelial cells, as measured by qpcr. here, we concentrate on
 xxxg1664xxx  expression and function in airway epithelial cells. panx2
was expressed approximately 8- to 10-fold lower than  xxxg1664xxx ,
and at similar levels in human airway epithelial cells and
alveolar macrophages.
 xxxg1664xxx  protein expression during airway cell differentiation
at the ali

in contrast to the mrna expression results, western blot
analysis of  xxxg1664xxx  expression during airway epithelial cell differentiation at the ali showed an approximately 20% increase in
protein expression during differentiation (three experiments
from three different lungs; figure 1c). this was, however,
consistent with the findings of  xxxg1664xxx  expression using immunocytochemistry (figure 2). during airway epithelial cell differentiation,  xxxg1664xxx  expression was examined in ali cultures by
immunocytochemistry.  xxxg1664xxx  was diffusely detected in undifferentiated cells on day 1 after switching the cultures to ali
conditions (figure 2), but expression increased over time, consistent with the findings in the western blots (figure 1). after 10
days at the ali,  xxxg1664xxx  was clearly detected at the apex (figure 2),
where ciliogenesis occurred, but was present there even before
cilia were evident (no ciliary pattern seen with antiacetylated
tubulin staining on day 10).
localization of  xxxg1664xxx  in airway epithelial cells

to determine the cellular location of  xxxg1664xxx  in the airway
epithelium, immunohistochemistry was done using a chicken
antibody against  xxxg1664xxx , previously characterized to be specific
(27), and tracheal sections from three lung donors, as well as
nhbe cell ali cultures from the same individuals.  xxxg1664xxx  was
observed at the apical pole of airway epithelia in tracheal
sections (figure 3). the expression did not seem restricted to
ciliated cells, because goblet cells showed possible  xxxg1664xxx 
staining (figure 3c). in addition, submucosal glands express
 xxxg1664xxx  preferentially at the basolateral aspect of the glandular
acini (figure 3d, arrow).

confocal images from nhbe cell ali cultures also revealed
expression of  xxxg1664xxx  at the apical membrane (figures 4a and
4b). although most ciliated cells showed expression of  xxxg1664xxx  at
the apical membrane (just below ciliary axonemes stained with
antiacetylated tubulin in red), expression was not limited to
these cells.
the expression of  xxxg1664xxx  at the apex upon differentiation
makes pannexons suitable candidates for atp release in airway
epithelial cells.
measurement of atp release upon hypotonic stress

convincing evidence shows that pannexons mediate atp release in several other cell types, including erythrocytes (20, 21,
27, 32). to examine whether pannexons are involved in atp
release from airway epithelial cell cultures, ali cultures were
exposed to hypotonic stress (200 mosm), as previously described (8). atp release was measured in real time in the apical compartment of 24-mm diameter transwell cultures with
luciferin/luciferase in a luminometer (8). after initially adding
inhibitors of atp metabolizing enzymes, including 300 mm
b-g-methylene-atp, 30 mm ebselen, and 10 mm levamisole (8),
we abandoned the practice, as we did not observe any differences in the results with or without inhibitors (except that the
sensitivity of the assay decreased with inhibitors present).
standard curves were created using known atp concentrations.
hypotonic stress induced maximal atp release within less than
1 minute after challenge, with a time course similar to the one
described by others (8). the maximal atp concentration
reached was estimated at 255 (664) nm using atp standards
(n 5 6 ali cultures from three different lungs). if the dilution
of the added fluid to the apical surface is taken into account, this
would translate to approximately 1.5 (60.4) mm in a ‘‘normal’’
airway surface liquid volume (33).
evaluation of pannexon inhibitors on atp release upon
hypotonic stress

to assess whether or not pannexon inhibitors influence atp
release from cells fully differentiated at the ali, experiments
using hypotonic stress were repeated in the presence or absence
of the pannexon inhibitors, cbx (31) and probenecid (34).
simple hypotonic stress was used as a control for probenecid
(naoh soluble and buffered), while ffa in dmso was used as
a control for cbx (soluble in dmso). ffa is a good control
here, because it exerts only a modest inhibitory effect on

figure 2.  xxxg1664xxx  expression during airway epithelial cell
differentiation at the ali. ali cultures 1, 10, 15, and
20 days after establishing ali conditions were fixed and
stained with anti- xxxg1664xxx  (green) and antiacetylated tubulin
(enriched in cilia, red).  xxxg1664xxx  localizes to the apical pole of
cells upon differentiation, but before cilia are present (see
days 10 and 15 in upper right and lower left, respectively).

pannexons in contrast to cbx (31, 35). to analyze the curves,
we calculated the slope of atp increase over the first 20
seconds of hypotonic stress as an indication of the initial speed
of atp release, as well as the area under curve (auc) for the
first 200 seconds as a measure of overall atp increase, similar
to previous analyses (35).
in comparison to ffa, cbx significantly inhibited atp
release (figure 5). the same was true for probenecid in
comparison to control (figure 5). the slope of atp release
and the auc in response to hypotonic stress (the latter
normalized to control) was 1.15 (60.25) alu/s (mean 6 se)
and 1.8 (60.4) arbitrary units, respectively (n 5 16 from at least
four different lungs). in contrast, both values were significantly
reduced by 10 mm cbx, to 0.43 (60.06) alu/s for the slope
and 0.79 (60.2) arbitrary units for the auc (n 5 18 from at
least four different lungs; for both values, p compared with
ffa , 0.05). probenecid (n 5 18 from at least four different lungs;
1 mm) reduced the slope of atp release from a control value of
0.80 (60.14) to 0.27 (60.03) alu/s (p , 0.05), and the auc
from a control value of 1 (60.14) (normalized) to 0.5 (60.1)
arbitrary units (p , 0.05).
to assure the adequacy of these inhibitors for pannexons
formed by  xxxg1664xxx , xenopus oocytes expressing  xxxg1664xxx  were used
and  xxxg1664xxx -related currents measured during application of
appropriate concentrations of ffa, cbx, and probenecid in
the whole cell patch configuration. figure 5e shows that 100 mm
ffa had no significant influence on pannexon-related currents,
whereas both 10 mm cbx and 1 mm probenecid inhibited the
channels almost completely.

evaluated for mrna knockdown. nondifferentiated cells were
infected with individual shrna-expressing lentiviruses, redifferentiated in the presence of  xxxd3041xxx , and tested for  xxxg1664xxx 
mrna (triplicate cultures for quantitative rt-pcr). three of
the lentivirus constructs showed significant knockdown, with one
shrna construct reducing  xxxg1664xxx  mrna expression consistently
to less than 15% of the nontargeted control (shrna #3; figure 6).
by western blot analysis, however,  xxxg1664xxx  protein reduction using
the three shrnas was less dramatic. shrna #1 did not reduce
 xxxg1664xxx  protein expression and shrna #2 reduced it only slightly
(95% of nontargeted sequence; duplicate experiments), whereas
shrna #3 reduced protein expression to 73 (61)% (duplicate
experiments) of nontargeted control (figure 6).
to assess the relation between  xxxg1664xxx  protein knockdown
and atp release, ali cultures infected with each of these three
constructs were also used for atp release experiments (triplicate experiments from one lung, but from a different individual
than any of the inhibitor experiments; figure 6). compared with
a nontarget control, shrna #1 reduced the auc for atp
release from 1,397 (6140) to 962 (6197), shrna #2 to 902
(6232), and shrna #3 to 553 (647) arbitrary units (latter, p ,
0.05). the relationships between  xxxg1664xxx  protein expression and
atp release for these experiments are shown in figure 6d.
these results show that knockdown of  xxxg1664xxx  expression in
fully differentiated airway epithelial cells using shrna-expressing lentiviruses also reduces atp release significantly, and was
consistent with the results from the inhibitor experiments.
together, these data support atp release via  xxxg1664xxx  in airway
epithelial cells.

 xxxg1664xxx  knockdown with shrna reduces  xxxg1664xxx  expression
and atp release upon hypotonic stress

discussion

to confirm the results with inhibitors that suggested a role for
 xxxg1664xxx  in hypotonic stress–induced atp release, shrna-expressing lentiviruses were used to specifically reduce  xxxg1664xxx  expression
in airway epithelial cells. five human immunodeficiency virus–
pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing five different shrnas targeted at  xxxg1664xxx  with a selectable  xxxd3041xxx  resistance gene were

the importance of atp release from airway epithelial cells for
the regulation of many cellular functions has been recognized
for some time. one of the most important airway host defense
mechanisms governed by the airway epithelium is mucociliary
clearance. effective mucociliary clearance depends on many
factors: in addition to mucus rheology, among these important

factors are adequate airway surface liquid (asl) volume and
adequate ciliary activity. both asl volume and ciliary beat
frequency are regulated by the paracrine action of atp (e.g.,
refs. 2, 5). in the absence of compensatory camp signaling,
mucociliary clearance fails if this paracrine atp system breaks
down (33, 36).
although the exact mechanism of atp release remains
unknown, it is quite likely that multiple mechanisms are involved. we know that airway epithelial cells release atp upon
increases in cytosolic ca21 concentration or upon mechanical
stress. the evidence for vesicular release is covered in the
introduction to this article. in addition, a recent publication also
gives credence to the previously assumed release of atp
together with mucins in the airway, likely stemming from goblet
cell vesicles (37). whether the  xxxg1664xxx  expression in goblet cells
is related to this phenomenon remains to be explored. however,
there seem to be additional mechanisms at play. when focusing
on literature describing mechanically activated calcium waves
spreading through airway epithelial cell sheets, gap junctional
proteins were implicated to play a role for the spread of the
wave. initially, the data were interpreted to mean that a messenger spreads through gap junctions to different cells (38–41).
however, other data have surfaced implicating atp release
with paracrine action rather than messenger spreading through
gap junction in calcium wave propagation (42), whereas others
have reported data supporting both theories (43).
multiple channels have been studied as candidates for atp
release, and many of them have been rejected as the main

contributors, as discussed in the introduction. given the data on
calcium wave spreading through airway epithelia, there is a need
to bring together the seemingly disparate results on the regulation of calcium wave propagation using only one paradigm.
many studies have invoked ‘‘hemichannel’’-forming  xxxg895xxx 
(channel to the outside of the cell, as opposed to a full gap
junction channel between cells) as the mediator of atp release,
at least in experiments dealing with calcium wave propagation
(e.g., refs. 44–46). the key question is whether  xxxg895xxx  could
release atp by forming channels to the extracellular space,
even though the existence of such channels is not well substantiated. before the discovery of panx, three key observations
led to the conclusion that connexons could be involved in atp
release: (1) atp release in most cell types is correlated with the
uptake of dyes typically used for testing intercellular communication through gap junction channels (45, 47); (2) gap junction
blockers can attenuate atp release (47); and (3) connexin
mimetic peptides inhibit atp release or surrogate measures of
it (18, 48). on the other hand, there are weighty arguments
against a connexon-mediated atp release. no authentic connexin
(hemichannel to the outside of cells) activity has been documented under physiological conditions.  xxxg895xxx  hemichannel activity, for example, requires extreme polarization (. 150 mv),
which can only be achieved by voltage clamp in a laboratory
setting (49). dye uptake and sensitivity to drugs is shared
by connexin gap junction channels and pannexon channels
(27, 31). importantly, connexin mimetic peptides have been
demonstrated to affect pannexon channels rather than connexin
hemichannels (50, 51). finally, atp release can be observed in
connexin-free environments. erythrocytes and taste cells release atp, but do not express connexins (27, 32). furthermore,
observations that calcium wave propagation in spinal cord
astrocytes from  xxxg895xxx  knockout mice are still mediated by
extracellular diffusion of atp argue against  xxxg895xxx  connexon
as the sole atp release channel (52). in addition, an inhibitor of
 xxxg895xxx  (ffa; see also below) did not prevent atp release upon
shear stress from airway epithelial cells in media containing
normal calcium levels (35). finally, immunohistochemical studies on fully differentiated human airway epithelia do reveal gap
junction formation by cx30 and cx31 between cells (53).
 xxxg895xxx , however, was down-regulated in fully differentiated cells
compared with the undifferentiated state. no connexin expression was found at the apical membrane in human airway
epithelial cells (53), and the same was true for mouse airway
epithelial sections (53). thus, substantial data exist that strongly
argue against a role for connexins in release of atp.
erythrocytes release atp in low-oxygen conditions and upon
mechanical stress (54, 55). erythrocytes express  xxxg1664xxx  at high
levels, and a channel activity consistent with  xxxg1664xxx  can be
recorded from membrane patches excised from erythrocytes
(27). furthermore, atp release from erythrocytes can be attenuated by cbx (27). thus, functions thought to be due to
connexins may be provided by panx instead, especially  xxxg1664xxx 
that forms ‘‘pannexons’’ (i.e., channels to the outside of cells [and
little, if any, evidence in fact supports formation of junctional
channels between cells by panx; see refs. 56–58). in addition to
being expressed in tissues that reveal atp release, pannexons are
mechanosensitive, gated by ca21, and, if open, highly permeable
to atp (20). unlike connexons, pannexons open at resting
membrane potentials in response to mechanical stress (20). when
coexpressed with p2y receptors,  xxxg1664xxx  channels open in response to extracellular atp that signals via intracellular ca21
(21). application of micromolar ca21 to the cytoplasmic side of
pannexons in excised membrane patches activates the channels,
in contrast to most connexons that are either closed or unaffected
by ca21 (e.g., ref. 59).

18 from at least four lungs). *significant difference of cbx compared with ffa; †significant difference of probenecid to control. (e) electrophysiology

(from 250 to 150 mv) to open the channels, seen in the lower trace as current. whereas 10 mm cbx (in dmso) and 1 mm probenecid inhibited
channel opening, 100 mm ffa (in dmso) had a marginal effect. right panel: quantification of triplicate measurements.

the data shown here indicate that  xxxg1664xxx  in fact contributes to
atp release in airway epithelial cells.  xxxg1664xxx  is expressed and
correctly localized for atp release, namely at the apex. in
addition, cbx and probenecid, but not ffa, inhibited atp
release from airway epithelia upon hypotonic stress, consistent
with the finding that ffa, in contrast to cbx and probenecid,

exerts only a modest inhibitory effect on pannexons (31).
although cbx only poorly discriminates between connexin
and panx channels, probenecid inhibits  xxxg1664xxx  channels, but not
connexin channels (34). finally, suppressing  xxxg1664xxx  expression in
fully differentiated airway epithelial cells using shrna-expressing lentiviruses also inhibited atp release upon hypotonic stress.

infected with nontargeted,

sequence–expressing lentiviruses (triplicate culture
measurements). a significant reduction in atp release
is found in shrna #3–
expressing cells. (d) relationship of protein expression
and atp release (quantified
as auc as in figure 5) is
shown in cultures expressing
shrna #1, shrna #2, and
shrna #3 sequence–expressing lentiviruses. all points represent triplicate cultures.
shrna #3 reduces both
 xxxg1664xxx  protein expression
and atp release. *p , 0.05.

together, these data make a strong case for the involvement of
 xxxg1664xxx  in atp from airway epithelia. these data are also
consistent with those of previous reports indicating that ffa
was ineffective in inhibiting atp release upon shear stress (35).
we also examined panx2 and panx3 expression by mrna in
airway epithelial cells. panx2 mrna is expressed at much lower
levels than  xxxg1664xxx , and, as indicated above, panx2 cannot form
a functional channel itself (29). the data on panx3 are still
inconclusive, with one article indicating doubt that panx3 itself
is functional (31), and one other article showing channel formation when panx3 is overexpressed (30). however, human airway
epithelial cells do not express panx3 mrna, and, thus, this
protein does not function as an atp release channel in these cells.
if we accept that  xxxg1664xxx  contributes to atp release from
airway epithelia, the question remains whether its inhibition will
have a significant effect on airway epithelial cell function.
although experiments addressing this issue are beyond the scope
of this article, the question brings up a previous criticism of atp
release measurements on cell surfaces: many measurements of
atp concentrations on cells indicate concentrations reaching less
than the ec50 of approximately 1 mm required for signaling by
naturally expressed  xxxg1646xxx  receptors (e.g., ref. 60). on the other
hand, studies not measuring atp directly, but evaluating its
effects on airway epithelial cell function (e.g., ref. 36), made
a strong case for atp release being an important paracrine

mediator. a recent study showed that the discrepancy is due to
the measurement system used and the inability to bring the
luciferase close enough to its substrate atp in sampling studies
(8). using very low measurement volumes or cell-attached
luciferase solved the problem, and showed that hypotonic
stress–induced atp release onto airway surfaces can reach
atp concentrations in the micromolar range (8). in fact, we used
small volume measurements, shown to yield similar results
compared with cell-attached luciferase (8), and our estimations
of atp concentrations are consistent with this report (8): [atp]
in asl reached . 1 mm. assessing the contribution of  xxxg1664xxx  to
this process then reveals that inhibiting panx (here, atp release
was reduced by approximately 60% in the presence of panx
inhibitors) will bring this concentration below the threshold of
1 mm. this indicates that adequate  xxxg1664xxx  function may be crucial
for maintaining normal airway epithelial cell function during
stress.
finally, other sources of atp in the airway will have to be
assessed. an evaluation of the potential for macrophages to
contribute has been attempted here by looking at panx expression in these cells as well. in fact,  xxxg1664xxx  is expressed in alveolar
macrophages, at least on an mrna level. however, the number
of macrophages in the airway under normal conditions is low,
and, thus, the contribution of these cells to atp availability will
have to await further testing.
