abstract
background: n-3  xxxd2154xxx  may decrease risk of colorectal
cancer by inhibiting the  xxxg1884xxx  enzyme and
production of proinflammatory eicosanoids derived from
 xxxd208xxx  (20:4n-6). aspirin also inhibits the  xxxg1884xxx  enzyme and may share with n-3  xxxd2154xxx  a
potential mechanism to decrease the risk of colorectal cancer.
methods: we conducted a nested case-control analysis using
blood samples collected from the physicians’ health study
participants in 1982 to 1984. n-3 and n-6 fatty acid levels
were measured using gas-liquid chromatography for 178 men
who developed colorectal cancer through december 31, 1995
and 282 age- and smoking-matched controls. we used
conditional logistic regression to examine associations. all
statistical tests were two-sided.
results: total long-chain n-3  xxxd2154xxx  were nonsignificantly
inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk [relative risk

(rr) for highest versus lowest quartile, 0.60; 95% confidence
interval (95% ci), 0.32 to 1.11; p trend = 0.10], after adjustment for
possible confounders. we observed potential interaction
between randomized aspirin assignment and long-chain n-3
fatty acid levels (p interaction = 0.04). among men not on
aspirin, rrs (95% ci) for increasing quartiles of long-chain
n-3  xxxd2154xxx  were 1.00 (reference), 0.60 (0.28-1.28), 0.51 (0.221.17), and 0.34 (0.15-0.82), p trend = 0.006. for participants
taking aspirin, there was no additional benefit of increasing
n-3 fatty acid levels. the rr (95% ci) for the highest versus
lowest quartile of n-6  xxxd2154xxx  was 0.64 (0.35-1.17).
conclusions: blood levels of long-chain n-3  xxxd2154xxx  were
associated with decreased risk of colorectal cancer among
men not using aspirin. n-6  xxxd2154xxx  were nonsignificantly
inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk. (cancer

introduction
the two classes of polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (pufas), n-3
[including  xxxd2490xxx ,  xxxd2318xxx  (epa), and
docosahexaenoic acid (dha)] and n-6 [including linoleic
acid (la) and  xxxd208xxx  (aa)], play essential roles in
human nutrition and health. sources of  xxxd2490xxx 
include flaxseed oil,  xxxd3230xxx , canola oil, and walnuts,
whereas the longer chain n-3  xxxd2154xxx , epa and dha, are
mainly found in fish. most vegetable oils are good sources of
la. both ecologic and animal studies support an inverse
association between the intake of n-3  xxxd2154xxx  and the risk
of colorectal cancer (1-7). however, the results of case-control
and cohort studies have been inconsistent. three studies
(8-10) support an inverse association between dietary n-3
fatty acid intake and colon or colorectal cancer, whereas six
others suggest a null association (11-16). in a recent nested
case-control study, serum n-3  xxxd2154xxx  were significantly
inversely associated with colorectal cancer in males but not
females (17).
n-3  xxxd2154xxx  could potentially affect colorectal cancer
development by several mechanisms, including the inhibition
of both the  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) enzyme and production
of eicosanoids derived from aa (18-23). n-3 and n-6 pufas
compete for the desaturase and elongase enzymes, which

convert  xxxd2490xxx  to the longer chain epa and dha and
also convert la to aa (18, 24). in addition, there is
competition between n-3 and n-6  xxxd2154xxx  for the cox
enzymes, which convert epa to prostaglandin h3 and aa to
prostaglandin h2 (25-27). prostaglandin h3 and prostaglandin
h2 are further converted to other prostaglandins and thromboxanes by additional enzymes. eicosanoids derived from n-6
 xxxd2154xxx  are generally proinflammatory, whereas those
derived from n-3  xxxd2154xxx  are antiinflammatory (18, 28).
animal studies also support the hypothesis that high dietary
intake of n-6  xxxd2154xxx  increases the incidence of colon tumors
in mice and rats treated with the carcinogen azoxymethane
(5-7). this has led some researchers to suggest that n-6 fatty
acids may increase the risk of colorectal cancer, possibly
through the effects of these proinflammatory eicosanoids
(22, 23). however, five studies (9, 12-15) that examined
the association between dietary total n-6 or la (the major
dietary n-6 fatty acid) and colorectal cancer reported null
associations, whereas one reported a nonsignificant positive
association (16).
because n-3  xxxd2154xxx  can inhibit the cox-2 enzyme (3, 29),
they may share with aspirin a potential mechanism to decrease
the risk of colorectal cancer. aspirin suppresses both the
cox-1 and cox-2 enzymes, and regular aspirin use decreases
the risk of both adenoma and colorectal cancer, possibly
through its inhibition of cox-2, although other mechanisms
have been proposed (30). a shared mechanism would imply
that exposure to both would not materially enhance any
protective effect over exposure to only one.
we examined the association between blood levels of both
n-3 and n-6 pufas and colorectal cancer risk using a
prospective, nested case-control design among participants in
the physicians’ health study (phs). this study began as a
randomized controlled trial of aspirin, and this allowed for the
evaluation of potential modification of these associations by
aspirin intake.

study population. this prospective case-control study was
nested within the phs, a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled factorial trial of aspirin (325 mg every other day)
and h-carotene (50 mg on alternate days) supplementation for
the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease.
the participants were 22,071 male physicians aged 40 to 84
years at baseline in 1982, and with no history of myocardial
infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or cancer at the
time of enrollment (31). the institutional review board at
brigham and women’s hospital (boston, ma) approved the
research protocol, and all subjects provided written informed
consent. the aspirin component of the trial ended in january
1988 due to the finding of a substantial benefit of aspirin on the
incidence of myocardial infarction (31). at that time, the
participants had been followed for an average of 5 years. after
the end of the aspirin component of the trial, participants chose
whether they would receive aspirin or placebo along with their
randomly assigned h-carotene treatment. information on
aspirin use was monitored on annual follow-up questionnaires, with 71% of men choosing to take aspirin on z3 days
per week as of the 7-year follow-up questionnaire.
before randomization, kits for blood sampling were sent to
participants with instructions to have their blood drawn into
edta-containing vacuum tubes and to centrifuge a portion of
the samples to provide both plasma and whole blood. these
samples were then placed on ice, sent to the study investigators by prepaid overnight courier, divided into aliquots,
and stored at 80jc. specimens were obtained from 14,916
physicians. participants also provided information on height,
weight, physical activity, multivitamin use, alcohol intake, and
history of smoking and diabetes on the baseline questionnaire.
the frequency of consumption of red meat, fish, cheese, and
ice cream was obtained on the 12-month follow-up questionnaire. questions inquiring about milk intake were included on
the 18-month questionnaire.
identification of cases and controls. the diagnosis of
colorectal cancer was reported by participants on annual
follow-up questionnaires. medical records, including the
pathology report, were then obtained and reviewed by the
end-point committee for the phs to confirm the diagnosis.
histologic details as well as the site and stage of the disease
were documented from the medical record. information on
deaths was obtained from family members, postal authorities,
and periodic searches of the national death index. follow-up
is over 99% complete for mortality and morbidity.
there were 178 confirmed cases of colorectal cancer through
december 31, 1995, among those who provided baseline blood
samples. we attempted to select two controls for each case
using risk-set sampling. controls were selected among
participants who had provided a blood sample at baseline
and had not reported a diagnosis of cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer) at the time the case reported their
diagnosis. controls were matched on age (f1 year for younger
participants, f5 years for older participants) and smoking
status (never, past, current). we were able to identify two
controls for 104 of 178 cases, and therefore, a total of 282
participants were selected as controls.
measurement of blood  xxxd2154xxx .  xxxd2154xxx  in whole
blood were extracted into an isopropanol-hexane solution
containing 2.6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol as an antioxidant and
were transmethylated with methanol and  xxxd3258xxx . after
esterification, fatty acid methyl esters were redissolved in
iso-octane and assessed by gas-liquid chromatography (32).
peak retention times were identified by injecting known standards, and purity ranges are all above 99% (nucheck prep,
elysium, mn), using chemstation a.08.03 software (agilent
technologies, santa clara, ca) for analysis. randomly

inserted quality-control samples (about 6% of the total real
samples analyzed) were used to measure coefficients of
variation (cvs) for all fatty acid peaks. our quality-control
samples were whole blood specimens from individuals who
gave a blood sample before randomization and were subsequently not randomized into the phs. these samples were
collected at the same time and stored for the same number of
years as the real samples.
cases and their controls were analyzed in the same batch,
and laboratory personnel were blinded to case, control, and
quality-control status. from this analysis, we obtained information on levels of total n-3, n-6, saturated, monounsaturated,
and trans-unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx , as well as individual fatty
acids [including  xxxd2490xxx , epa, docosapentaenoic acid
(dpa), dha, la, and aa]. the mean intra-assay cvs were
2.3% for  xxxd2490xxx , 5.4% for epa, 4.5% for dpa, 2.7%
for dha, 2.3% for la, and 1.8% for aa. we do not report
interassay cvs because all samples were analyzed in the same
run.
statistical analysis. we first compared the baseline risk
factors for colorectal cancer between cases and controls using
means or proportions. the correlation between baseline longchain n-3 fatty acid levels and other  xxxd2154xxx , as well as
between long-chain n-3  xxxd2154xxx  and fish intake, were
calculated using the spearman rank-correlation coefficient.
blood fatty acid levels were generally not normally distributed
and were log transformed when used as continuous variables.
total and individual n-3 and n-6 fatty acid levels (as percent of
total  xxxd2154xxx ) for cases and controls were compared using
the wilcoxon rank-sum test.
blood levels of n-3 and n-6  xxxd2154xxx  were divided into
quartiles based on the distribution of these  xxxd2154xxx  in the
controls. estimates of the rr of colorectal cancer for quartiles
of blood n-3 and n-6  xxxd2154xxx  were obtained using
conditional logistic regression to account for the matched
case-control study design. multivariate models adjusted for
potential confounding factors, including body mass index
(kg/m2), randomized aspirin treatment assignment, diabetes,
physical activity, multivitamin use, alcohol intake, red meat
intake, dairy intake (including milk, cheese, and ice cream),
and blood levels of other  xxxd2154xxx . tests for trend were
done by assigning the median value to each quartile and
modeling this as a continuous variable in separate regression
models.
to assess potential effect modification by aspirin assignment,
we used conditional logistic regression to estimate rrs of
colorectal cancer for cross-tabulations of blood fatty acid
quartile and aspirin assignment. to formally test for interaction, we included a term that was the product of blood fatty
acid level (as a continuous variable) and aspirin assignment in a
conditional logistic regression model and used a likelihood
ratio test. we also examined the potential trend of the
association between n-3  xxxd2154xxx  and risk of colorectal cancer
after stratifying by aspirin assignment. stratification by aspirin
breaks the matching of case-control pairs, and therefore,
unconditional logistic regression adjusted for the matching
factors as well as the covariates mentioned above was used to
conduct this analysis and to test for trend within each stratum.
in addition, we assessed potential effect modification by aspirin
according to follow-up time. this was done using separate
conditional logistic regression models, first including cases and
their matched controls occurring before the end of the aspirin
component of the trial and then including only cases and their
matched controls occurring after the end of the aspirin
component. to examine the joint effects of n-3 and n-6 fatty
acid levels, we estimated relative risks for cross-tabulations of
tertiles of these  xxxd2154xxx . to test for interaction, we again used
a likelihood ratio test to compare a model containing a term that
was the product of n-3 and n-6  xxxd2154xxx  to a model that

for all statistical analyses.

results
table 1 shows the baseline characteristics and geometric mean
blood n-3 and n-6 fatty acid levels among the 178 cases and 282
controls. there were no substantial differences in the distribution of baseline variables for these two groups. in addition,
geometric mean blood levels of n-3 and n-6  xxxd2154xxx  did not
differ significantly between those who developed colorectal
cancer and their matched controls. the spearman correlation
between blood levels of total long-chain n-3  xxxd2154xxx  and fish
intake was 0.24. for dark fish, the correlation was 0.35.
the rr of colorectal cancer by blood levels of total longchain n-3  xxxd2154xxx  is shown in table 2. in the basic model
accounting for only the matching factors, increasing level of
total long-chain n-3  xxxd2154xxx  was inversely related to the
risk of colorectal cancer, although this relationship was not
statistically significant (p trend = 0.08). results from the
multivariate model adjusting for other potential confounding
factors were not materially altered [rr for quartile 4 versus
quartile 1, 0.60; 95% confidence interval (95% ci) = 0.32-1.11],
and further adjustment for quartiles of dairy intake produced
similar results (data not shown). blood levels of long-chain n-3
 xxxd2154xxx  were moderately inversely correlated with total
monounsaturated (r = 0.40) and total trans-unsaturated
(r = 0.35)  xxxd2154xxx . adjustment for both monounsaturated
and trans-unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  did not substantially change
the association between long-chain n-3  xxxd2154xxx  and the risk
of colorectal cancer (table 2, multivariate model 2). the

n-6 pufas was weakly positive (r = 0.09). after additional
adjustment of multivariate model 1 for the quartile of total n-6
pufas, the rrs (95% ci) of colorectal cancer for increasing
quartiles of long-chain n-3  xxxd2154xxx  were 0.88 (0.49-1.56), 0.77
(0.43-1.38), and 0.60 (0.32-1.12; p trend = 0.09).
the major individual long-chain n-3  xxxd2154xxx , epa and
dha, were also inversely associated with colorectal cancer
risk (table 2). in addition, the rrs (95% ci) for increasing
quartiles of dpa were 1.25 (0.72-2.16), 0.93 (0.52-1.66), and 0.69
(0.35-1.35; p trend = 0.16).  xxxd2490xxx  was not associated
with colorectal cancer risk [rrs (95% ci) for increasing
quartiles, 1.25 (0.71-2.19), 1.04 (0.59-1.83), and 1.08 (0.611.91)]. this finding was not substantially altered by adjustment
for long-chain n-3  xxxd2154xxx  or total n-6 pufas.
we next assessed whether the association between total
long-chain n-3  xxxd2154xxx  and risk of colorectal cancer differed
by aspirin assignment. participants who were not assigned to
aspirin and whose blood levels of long-chain n-3  xxxd2154xxx 
were in the lowest quartile served as the common reference
group (fig. 1). compared with the common reference group,
the rrs (95% ci) for increasing quartiles of long-chain n-3 fatty
acids for those assigned to aspirin were 0.55 (0.26-1.15), 0.57
(0.24-1.35), 0.55 (0.25-1.21), and 0.54 (0.22-1.31). long-chain n-3
 xxxd2154xxx  did not provide additional benefits for these
participants. however, among those not assigned to aspirin,
the rrs (95% ci) for increasing quartiles of long-chain n-3 fatty
acids were 0.60 (0.28-1.28), 0.51 (0.22-1.17), and 0.34 (0.15-0.82).
this interaction was statistically significant (p = 0.04). when
we restricted the analysis to participants not assigned to
aspirin, the rrs (95% ci) for increasing quartiles of long-chain
n-3  xxxd2154xxx  were 0.57 (0.26-1.23), 0.45 (0.20-1.04), and 0.30
(0.13-0.71; p trend = 0.006). the corresponding rrs (95% ci) for
participants assigned to aspirin were 1.14 (0.50-2.60), 1.02 (0.462.23), and 1.09 (0.48-2.50; p trend = 0.90). we did not observe a
statistically significant interaction between  xxxd2490xxx  and
aspirin assignment (data not shown).
we further assessed the above interaction for cases (and
matched controls) diagnosed before and after january 1988, the
time at which the aspirin component of the trial ended. there
were 59 cases and 83 controls before and 119 cases and 199
controls after january 1988. given that aspirin is hypothesized
to act in the early promotion stages in the prevention of
colorectal cancer, we would expect to see the interaction only
in the analysis of cases and matched controls that occurred
after the end of the aspirin component of the trial (because it is
long-term aspirin use that is associated with decreased risk of
colorectal cancer; ref. 33). for the analysis of cases and
matched controls that occurred before the end of the aspirin
component of the trial, we would expect little or no effect of
aspirin (or n-3  xxxd2154xxx  if they play a role during the same
stage of carcinogenesis as aspirin). the numbers of cases and
controls for the aspirin trial were too small to sustain a
meaningful analysis. however, the post-aspirin results were
similar to the overall results.
our results show a nonsignificant inverse association
between increasing levels of total n-6  xxxd2154xxx  and colorectal
cancer, which is similar in magnitude to the results for n-3
 xxxd2154xxx . (table 3). this nonsignificant inverse association
persisted after adjustment for quartile of long-chain n-3 fatty
acids. both la and aa were not significantly associated with
the risk of colorectal cancer. for increasing quartiles, the rrs
(95% ci) were 0.77 (0.45-1.33), 0.91 (0.54-1.54), and 0.86
(0.49-1.54) for la and 1.12 (0.66-1.91), 1.01 (0.58-1.77), and
0.89 (0.50-1.57) for aa. there was no suggestion of an
interaction between la or aa and aspirin assignment (data
not shown). the association between total n-6  xxxd2154xxx  and
colorectal cancer also did not differ by aspirin assignment
(p interaction = 0.57).
finally, there was no statistically significant interaction
between n-3 and n-6  xxxd2154xxx  (table 4). however, results

from the cross-tabulations of n-3 and n-6  xxxd2154xxx  suggested
that n-3  xxxd2154xxx  were most strongly inversely associated
with colorectal cancer risk at low levels of n-6  xxxd2154xxx 
[rr (95% ci), 0.50 (0.20-1.24)]. in addition, n-6  xxxd2154xxx  were
most strongly inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk
when n-3 fatty acid levels were low [rr (95% ci) = 0.47 (0.211.10)]. these findings do not support the hypothesized adverse
effect of a high n-6 and low n-3 fatty acid intake.

discussion
in this prospective, nested case-control study among u.s.
physicians, we observed nonsignificant inverse associations of
blood levels of long-chain n-3 and n-6  xxxd2154xxx  with
colorectal cancer risk. thus, our results do not support the
hypothesis that n-6  xxxd2154xxx  may increase risk of colorectal
cancer. in addition, we observed a possible interaction
between aspirin assignment in the phs trial and blood levels
of n-3  xxxd2154xxx  in association with colorectal cancer risk.
blood levels of long-chain n-3  xxxd2154xxx  were significantly
associated with decreased risk of colorectal cancer only among
men not taking aspirin.

although our finding of a possible interaction between
blood levels of n-3  xxxd2154xxx  and aspirin assignment provides
support for the hypothesis that aspirin and n-3  xxxd2154xxx 
share a mechanism to decrease the risk of colorectal cancer,
these results should be interpreted cautiously. previous
analyses in the phs found no association between randomized
aspirin assignment and colorectal cancer risk after 5 years (34)
and 12 (35) years of follow-up. these null findings could be
due to the low dose of aspirin used in this trial or to the
relatively short period of randomly assigned supplementation.
in a recent analysis from the nurses’ health study, chan et al.
(33) reported that aspirin use was significantly associated with
the risk of colorectal cancer only after z10 years of regular use,
and that the reduction in risk was greatest for women using
more than 14 aspirin tablets per week. it is also possible that
low-dose aspirin decreases the risk of colorectal cancer only
among those with low n-3 fatty acid intake. in the only other
study to examine this interaction, oh et al. (36) found no
modification of the effect of dietary long-chain n-3  xxxd2154xxx 
on the risk of distal colorectal adenoma by aspirin use.
our findings are fairly consistent with the only other known
prospective, nested case-control study to examine the association between biomarkers of n-3 fatty acid intake and

colorectal cancer risk. kojima et al. (17) reported significant
inverse associations for total n-3  xxxd2154xxx ,  xxxd2490xxx ,
dpa, and dha, in relation to colorectal cancer risk and a
nonsignificant inverse association for epa in men. we
observed a null association for  xxxd2490xxx , and our
overall results for total long-chain n-3  xxxd2154xxx , epa, and
dha were not statistically significant. one potential explanation for the differences in results is a likely higher intake
of n-3  xxxd2154xxx  in the japanese population, due to higher
fish consumption, compared with our group of u.s. physicians (37).
prospective data on the association between dietary n-3 and
n-6  xxxd2154xxx  and the risk of colorectal cancer are sparse.
kobayashi et al. (11) reported no association between dietary
epa and incidence of colorectal cancer incidence, and both

terry et al. (12) and pietinen et al. (13) observed no association
between dietary n-3 or n-6  xxxd2154xxx  and the risk of colorectal
cancer. no association for dietary n-3  xxxd2154xxx  and a
nonsignificant positive association for n-6  xxxd2154xxx  were
reported by lin et al. (16). bostick et al. (8) did observe an
inverse association between dietary n-3  xxxd2154xxx  and
colorectal cancer incidence that was not statistically significant.
among the case-control studies, nkondjock et al. (9) reported
that dietary total n-3  xxxd2154xxx  were inversely associated with
colorectal cancer risk, the ratio of n-6 to n-3  xxxd2154xxx  was
positively associated with risk, and total n-6  xxxd2154xxx 
showed no association. a significant inverse association
between total n-3  xxxd2154xxx  and both colon and rectal cancer
was reported by tavani et al. (10), whereas slattery et al. (14)
observed no associations for n-3 or n-6  xxxd2154xxx  in relation to
the risk of colon cancer.
in addition, several studies have assessed the relationship
between fish intake (the main dietary source of long-chain n-3
 xxxd2154xxx ) and colorectal cancer risk. among the prospective
cohort studies, seven reported inverse associations (8, 38-43),
although only two (38, 40) of these were statistically
significant. another seven reported null associations (11, 13,
16, 44-47), and one reported a nonsignificant positive association (48). in a cohort study conducted in a finnish population
(49), a positive association was reported for smoked and salted
fish, whereas intake of other fish was not associated with risk
of colorectal cancer.
larsson has reviewed several potential explanations for the
inconsistent findings (18), including nondifferential misclassification of dietary n-3 fatty acid intake, which would tend to
bias results toward the null, and low between-person
variability in intake of n-3  xxxd2154xxx , which reduces the
statistical power to find an association. many studies have also
failed to take into account the intake of n-6  xxxd2154xxx . this
could potentially be an important factor given the metabolic
interplay between n-3 and n-6  xxxd2154xxx . in addition, several
studies have reported on the association between total fish
intake and colorectal cancer risk when fatty fish intake may
provide a better measure of long-chain n-3 fatty acid intake
(18). in our study, we attempted to address some of these
issues by adjusting for blood levels of n-6  xxxd2154xxx  and
examining the interaction between blood levels of n-3 fatty
acids and aspirin, another factor that may alter the association
between n-3  xxxd2154xxx  and colorectal cancer risk. in addition,
our n-3 fatty acid biomarker, although certainly not a perfect
measure, may provide a more objective assessment of dietary

intake than would questionnaire-based information. we
estimate that our whole blood pufa measurements reflect
intake over a period of time intermediate between fatty acid
measurements from rbc membranes and from plasma.
although we are not aware of any data on the reliability of
whole blood fatty acid measurements over time, ma et al. (50)
reported a short-term reliability coefficient (based on three
blood samples collected at 2-week intervals) of 0.71 for pufas
based on cholesterol ester measurements. this decreased to
0.32 when plasma phospholipid measurements were used. the
long-term reliability coefficients (based on two samples
collected f3 years apart) for the various pufas ranged from
0.41 to 0.83 for the cholesterol ester measurements and from
0.35 to 0.81 for the phospholipid measurements.
the most widely investigated mechanisms by which n-3
 xxxd2154xxx  could potentially decrease the risk of colorectal
cancer are by inhibiting the cox-2 enzyme and the production
of eicosanoids derived from aa, which may lead to decreased
cell proliferation and increased apoptosis (18, 19, 21, 22).
increased cox-2 expression has been observed in colorectal
cancer and in some colorectal adenomas (51, 52). clinical trials
of fish oil supplementation in patients with sporadic colorectal
adenomas have reported reduced proliferation in the rectal
mucosa of these patients (53, 54). however, cheng et al. (55)
reported that higher n-3 fatty acid intake promotes apoptosis
of normal colonic mucosa and has no effect on proliferation.
several other mechanisms by which n-3  xxxd2154xxx  may
decrease the risk of colorectal cancer have been proposed.
these include the inhibition of  xxxg1626xxx ,
decreased bile acid excretion, altered protein kinase c activity,
decreased nfnb activity, activation of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor a and g ( xxxg1805xxx  and g), and decreased nitric
oxide production (18, 21-23).
although eicosanoids derived from n-6  xxxd2154xxx  are
generally proinflammatory (18, 28) and therefore suggested to
promote carcinogenesis (22, 23), some have been shown to
have anticarcinogenic effects. for example, 13-s-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-s-hode), which is the product of 15lipoxygenase metabolism of la, has been shown to be
decreased in human colon cancers and to decrease cell
proliferation and increase apoptosis in transformed colonic
epithelial cells (56). in addition, bull et al. (57) showed that
13-s-hode activated the nuclear receptor  xxxg1807xxx , which is
important for differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells, in
human colon cancer cell lines. 13-s-hode has also been
shown to inhibit ppary activation, leading to increased
apoptosis in colon cancer cells (58).
there are limitations of this study that should be noted.
first, we used a single baseline measurement for blood levels
of n-3  xxxd2154xxx . this baseline measurement may not be fully
representative of long-term n-3 fatty acid intake, and we were
not able to account for changes in intake over the period of
follow-up. in addition, the blood samples were stored at 80 c

for f20 years, and this could have resulted in some
degradation of long-chain pufas. however, the new york
university women’s health study (59) showed minimal effect
of oxidation in serum samples stored for 7 to 12 years.
although there could have been greater oxidation in our whole
blood samples due to the longer storage time or perhaps a
greater presence of enzymes compared with plasma samples,
our case and control samples were handled identically. as a
result, we would expect the rate of oxidation to be the same in
these two groups, and any oxidation that occurred would tend
to attenuate the observed relative risks toward the null. in
addition, the spearman correlation between long-chain n-3
 xxxd2154xxx  and fish intake in our study was 0.24, and for dark
fish, this correlation increased to 0.35. these correlations
suggest that there was no serious degradation of our samples
over time.
another possible limitation of our study is the fact that not
all phs participants gave blood samples. this could have led
to selection bias if those participants who donated blood
samples were in some way different (overall healthier lifestyle,
for example) than those who did not, and if this difference was
associated with both exposure and outcome. however, we
have previously compared the distributions of baseline risk
factors for colorectal cancer in the blood subgroup with that of
the full cohort and found them to be similar. in this
prospective analysis, all comparisons are made within the
group of physicians who provided blood samples.
we also do not have information on total energy intake in
this cohort. differences in caloric intake are mainly accounted
for by varying levels of physical activity. because physical
activity is inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk, we
would expect that caloric intake would also be inversely
associated with colorectal cancer risk. if blood levels of n-3
 xxxd2154xxx  were positively correlated with total energy intake,
lack of adjustment for energy intake could result in an
observed relative risk that is lower than the true relative risk
(i.e., negative confounding). although we do not have
information on total energy intake, plasma levels of n-3 fatty
acids were not correlated with total energy intake in the
nurses’ health study (october 30, 2006).3 therefore, the
association between blood levels of n-3  xxxd2154xxx  and
colorectal cancer risk should not be confounded by total
energy intake. in addition, we were not able to adjust for
dietary fiber intake. this could result in unmeasured confounding by dietary fiber intake. however, the results of some
recent prospective cohort studies have called into question
whether dietary fiber decreases the risk of colorectal cancer
(60, 61).

there is also the possibility that some of our cases could
have had colorectal cancer at the time that the blood samples
were collected. however, after excluding cases diagnosed
during the first 3 years of follow-up (leaving 145 cases and 236
controls), the rrs (95% ci) from the multivariate model for
increasing quartiles of total long-chain n-3  xxxd2154xxx  were 0.71
(0.38-1.31), 0.62 (0.32-1.19), and 0.50 (0.25-0.99; p trend = 0.05).
lastly, because this is an observational study, there is the
possibility that our results may be affected by residual
confounding or other unknown confounders. high blood
levels of n-3  xxxd2154xxx  may be a marker of other healthy
lifestyle behaviors. to minimize this possibility, we controlled
for several potentially confounding variables.
in summary, our findings suggest that long-chain n-3 fatty
acids may decrease the risk of colorectal cancer, and that this
association may be modified by aspirin use. in addition, our
results do not support the hypothesis that n-6  xxxd2154xxx 
increase the risk of this disease, but rather suggest an inverse
association. further investigation of the possible interaction
between long-chain n-3  xxxd2154xxx  and aspirin is warranted.
