the effect of  xxxd2957xxx  on creatine kinase is not due to

2-adrenoceptor partial agonist activity
we read with interest the recent article (tomlinson et
al., 1990) which demonstrated that an increase in serum
creatine kinase (ck) activity occurs during treatment
with the ,-adrenoceptor blocking drug  xxxd2957xxx . as a
possible explanation for this phenomenon the authors
postulated that the p2-adrenoceptor partial agonist
activity (paa) of  xxxd2957xxx  on skeletal muscle was responsible for this effect. known effects of p2-receptor
stimulation on skeletal muscle include finger tremor and
hypokalaemia (lipworth & mcdevitt, 1989a). however,
the effect of of 132-adrenoceptor stimulation on creatine
kinase has not to our knowledge been previously reported
in the literature. we therefore investigated the effects of
inhaled terbutaline (a known selective 132-adrenoceptor
agonist) on serum creatine kinase activity in 34 normal
volunteers (mean ± s.e. mean age, 25 ± 3 years).
all subjects attended the laboratory at the same time
of day (09.00 h) and were rested supine on arrival for a
period of 30 min. following this, subjects were given
inhaled terbutaline 5 mg delivered via a 750 ml pearshaped spacer device, in order to eliminate individual
differences in inhaler technique. thirty minutes after
inhalation, venous blood was taken for estimation of
serum potassium and creatine kinase activity. serum
potassium was analysed by flame photometry (il943,
instrumentation laboratory, warrington, uk) with a
coefficient of variation (cv) for analytical imprecision
of 0.4%. creatine kinase activity was assayed by an
ultraviolet method using a cobas fara centrifugal analyser
and ck nac kit (hoffman-la roche & do., ag
basel, switzerland) with a c.v. value for analytical
imprecision of 2.1%.
statistical comparisons before and after treatment
were made by two-way analysis of variance. paired
student's t-test was used to assess the significance of the
percentage change in ck activity. all values are given
as means and 95% confidence intervals. the critical
difference value for total variability in measuring ck
activity was calculated from the formula 1.65 x (cva2
+ cvi2)1/2, where cva represents the analytical
imprecision and cvi the intra-individual biological variability calculated from values derived from the world
literature for healthy subjects (costongs et al., 1985;
fraser, 1986). it has previously been shown that there is

no difference in biological variability between healthy
individuals and patients with chronic stable disease
(fraser, 1988). the critical difference value represents
the change required to exclude analytical and biological
variability with 95% confidence, and is calculated at
36.5% for creatine kinase. thus, an increase in ck in
response to terbutaline should be greater than the critical
difference value in order to represent a true drug effect.
the reference ranges for our laboratory are k (3.5-5.0
mmol l-1) and ck (up to 150 u l-1).
terbutaline produced a significant fall in serum k
from 3.83 (3.73 to 3.91) mmol i-1 to 3.42 (3.34 to 3.50)
mmol 1-1 (p < 0.001). there was no significant change
in ck activity: 99 294 to 103) u 1-1 before terbutaline,
104 (99 to 109) u l- after terbutaline. furthermore, the
percentage change (post-pre) in ck activity was 11
(-2 to 25)% and this was not statistically significant.
these results clearly show that terbutaline administration caused hypokalaemia, which is a known p2adrenoceptor-mediated effect on skeletal muscle (brown
et al., 1983; lipworth et al., 1989a,b), but in contrast the
same dose of terbutaline had no significant effect on
serum ck activity. indeed, the percentage change was
less than the critical difference value required to exclude
biological variability. our results suggest that the effect
of  xxxd2957xxx  on serum ck activity is not due to stimulation
of skeletal muscle ,32-adrenoceptors as a consequence
of its paa. this of course does not exclude the possibility
that  xxxd2957xxx  may cause direct non p2-mediated effects
on skeletal muscle resulting in release of ck, in chronic
rather than single dosing. studies are therefore indicated
to assess the effects on creatine kinase of other padrenoceptor blocking drugs with paa.
