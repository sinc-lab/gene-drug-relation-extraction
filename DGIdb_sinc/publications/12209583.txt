functions

currently available antioestrogens, such as tamoxifen, are
competitive inhibitors that bind to the ligand binding sites of
oestrogen receptors, er␣ and er␤. the search for alternative anti-hormone therapies is prompted by the need for
drugs that are effective when tumours become tamoxifen
resistant. the existence of different receptor isoforms also
raise the possibility of improving selectivity. earlier use of the
3␤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor,  xxxd3436xxx  (4␣,5epoxy-17␤-hydroxy-3-oxo-5␣-androstane-2␣-carbonitrile),
suggested that it had beneficial actions in breast cancer that
were only partially attributable to inhibition of steroidogenesis. the present studies on the interactions of  xxxd3436xxx 
with oestrogen receptors show that it (i) inhibits oestrogenstimulated proliferation in mcf-7 breast cancer cells, (ii)
enhances the affinity of  xxxd2037xxx  binding to er in rat uteri
and specifically increases  xxxd2037xxx  binding to an er␤-like
isoform, (iii) inhibits er␣ and er␤ binding to the classical
vitellogenin gene oestrogen response element (ere) and (iv)
inhibits oestrogen-stimulated gene transcription in erelinked reporter systems in mcf-7 cells. the results demonstrate a novel, presumably allosteric, mode of antioestrogen
action. the beneficial actions of  xxxd3436xxx  in breast cancer
may be attributed to the combination of this antioestrogen
effect with its well documented suppression of steroidogenesis.

the knowledge that in many patients the progress of breast
cancer is dependent on oestrogens has led to intensive research
over many years to limit either their effects or their production. in
particular, tamoxifen has been a highly successful drug because in
the breast it acts as a competitive inhibitor of oestrogen action by
binding to the  xxxg730xxx  (er␣ or er␤) at the ligand
binding site.1,2 tamoxifen may even be used in breast cancer
prevention.3 because it acts as an agonist in some tissues, tamoxifen also confers beneficial effects, for example, in osteoporosis.
however, there are disadvantages in that it is known to be associated with an increase in endometrial cancer.1,2 other drugs acting
on the receptor at the ligand binding site include raloxifene, which
is known not to be associated with endometrial cancer, but still
retains beneficial actions in bone.1,2 so-called “pure” antioestrogens include  xxxd576xxx  and  xxxd2165xxx ,780, which appear to decrease receptor stability by preventing dimerisation.4
more recently, attention has also focused on the reduction of
oestrogen synthesis by inhibition of aromatase activity.5 similarly,
steroid sulphatase is under active consideration as a target with a
view to blocking  xxxd2037xxx  production from inactive steroid sulphates.6,7 steroid 17␤-dehydrogenase may be another target as its
inhibition would prevent  xxxd2037xxx  formation from the less active
 xxxd2045xxx .8
such inhibitors of steroid synthesis act at late stages in the
pathway and are therefore incomplete blockers of steroidogenesis.
the roles of steroids other than oestrogens in breast cancer are
complex and, for example, both potentially beneficial and disadvantageous effects of progesterone or androgens have been reported.9 –11 for these reasons, it is useful to review the clinical
studies that have used inhibitors with actions at earlier stages in
steroid biosynthesis. in this regard,  xxxd3436xxx  (4␣,5-epoxy-17␤hydroxy-3-oxo-5␣-androstane-2␣-carbonitrile) is of interest as the
only 3␤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor available clinically.  xxxd3436xxx  has been used successfully in conditions associ-

ated with overproduction of adrenal steroids, such as cushing’s
and conn’s syndromes.12,13
in breast cancer, several trials showed that  xxxd3436xxx  at doses up
to 960 mg/day (with hydrocortisone or other glucocorticoid supplement to compensate for adrenal inhibition) was indeed effective
as a therapy for the control of post-menopausal breast cancer.14 –20
however, when all the trials, totalling nearly 800 patients, are
taken into account, there appear to be anomalies not accounted for
by the postulated mode of action. in particular, the beneficial
actions of  xxxd3436xxx  are not closely associated with changes in
circulating steroid concentrations.16,21 furthermore, though it is
known that glucocorticoid alone has beneficial effects in breast
cancer,22 the amount required seems to be higher than that used in
combination with  xxxd3436xxx ,21 suggesting that  xxxd3436xxx  has an
additional action. one suggested possibility was that  xxxd3436xxx  is
an aromatase inhibitor,16 but this has been shown not to be the
case.23 finally, although it was originally thought that  xxxd3436xxx 
has no direct effect on oestrogen or androgen receptors,21 the data
suggest that the response rate was greater in patients with a known
positive  xxxg730xxx  status, or those who were assumed to
be  xxxg730xxx  positive because they had previously responded to endocrine therapy.18
consequently, although it is evident from these studies that
 xxxd3436xxx  gives beneficial responses, its mode of action is not
obvious and a novel mechanism was therefore suspected. this
article describes experiments undertaken to examine the interactions of  xxxd3436xxx  with the oestrogen receptors, er␣ and er␤ and
its actions in breast cancer cell lines and in in vitro assays of er
function.

breast cancer cell proliferation
mcf-7 cells [obtained from american type culture collection
(atcc) manassas, va] were plated out in 24-well dishes at a
density of 5,000 cells per well and grown for 24 hr in eagles’
minimum essential medium (mem) containing 5% fetal bovine
serum (fbs). cells were then incubated for an additional 24 hr in
serum-free medium. following this, cells were grown in either
serum free medium alone (control wells) or serum free medium
with addition to experimental wells of  xxxd2037xxx  alone (10 nm) or
with  xxxd3436xxx  (10 ␮m). each treatment was performed in quadruplicate. cells were then cultured for 24 hr. after 20 hr, tritiated
thymidine was added to each well (amersham pharmacia biotech,
amersham, uk; 50 ␮ci/ml, sp. activity 5 ci/mmol) and cells were
cultured for an additional 4 hr. at the end of this period, the
medium was aspirated and the cultured cells were rinsed 3 times
with ice-cold buffer solution (50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4). cells
were then dissolved in 1 ml 0.1 n naoh and 0.5 ml of this
solution was mixed with 3.5 ml of scintillation cocktail (toluene
scintillator, packard bioscience b.v. groningen, netherlands) and
tritium content was assayed.
actions of  xxxd3436xxx  on  xxxd2037xxx  binding to oestrogen
receptors
rat uterine er. wistar rats, ⬃220 g body weight, were obtained
from commercial suppliers and maintained briefly in the biological services unit, queen mary, under standard conditions. animals were killed by stunning and cervical dislocation; uteri were
excised, cleaned and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. tissues were
stored in liquid nitrogen until required. supernatants that contained
soluble proteins were prepared as described previously.24 briefly,
uteri were minced and homogenised in 10 vol of glycerol phosphate buffer (gpbi) that contained molybdate and protease inhibitors [ph 7.4, 10% glycerol, 50 mm phosphate, 1.5 mm edta, 5
mm  xxxd2668xxx , 20 mm  xxxd3216xxx , 1 ␮g/ml of the
protease inhibitors aprotinin and soybean  xxxd207xxx  and 30
␮g/ml phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (pmsf)]. a high-speed
supernatant was obtained by centrifuging the homogenate at
100,000g. this preparation was aliquoted, frozen and stored in
liquid nitrogen until required. at assay, the receptor preparation
was thawed at 4°c, an aliquot taken for protein determination and
the cytosol used for receptor assays.
supernatants were incubated at 4°c for 18 hr with varying
concentrations of 3h- xxxd2037xxx  (0.078 –10 nm, amersham) in the
presence (non-specific binding) or absence (total binding) of a
100-fold excess of  xxxd1880xxx  (des). these incubations
were performed in the presence or absence of  xxxd3436xxx  (10 ␮m).
after overnight incubation, free steroid was separated from bound
by addition of 200 ␮l of a suspension of 0.25%(w/v) charcoal,
0.025% (w/v) dextran t70 in 10 mm tris hcl, 1.5 mm edta
buffer, ph 7.4 (dcc) and incubating for 10 min at 4°c. the
charcoal was pelleted by centrifugation  xxxd1891xxx ,000g. supernatants
were decanted and their isotope content was assayed. specific
receptor binding was calculated from the difference in bound
labelled steroid between the des competed and uncompeted tubes.
data were analysed by scatchard plot.
recombinant human er. pcr generated cdna inserts encoding
human er␣ or er␤ were cloned into pcr 3.1 vector (invitrogen,
groningen, netherlands) and er protein was obtained from 1 ␮g
of plasmid by in vitro transcription and translation in a rabbit
reticulocyte lysate system (promega, southampton, uk). the proteins obtained gave a single band of the appropriate molecular
weight on sds-page gels corresponding to full length er␣ or
er␤ and scatchard analysis showed that these receptor preparations bound  xxxd2037xxx  with an affinity within the published range.
these crude lysates were diluted in gpbi (1:20) and then used in
radioligand binding assays to compare  xxxd2037xxx  binding in the
presence or absence of  xxxd3436xxx  (10 ␮m), as described for rat
uterine preparations above.
isoelectric focusing (ief). aliquots of rat uterus cytosol were
incubated with 3h- xxxd2037xxx  (10 nm) alone or with tamoxifen (0.1

␮m, sigma) or  xxxd3436xxx  (10 ␮m) at 4°c overnight and then
analysed using high-resolution isoelectric focusing. ief gels were
cast in slabs of size 125⫻260 mm and separation was conducted
along the long side of the gel as previously described.24 polyacrylamide gels (2 mm thick) containing 20% (v/v) glycerol and with
high porosity (t⫽5%, c⫽3%) were used. a ph gradient was
achieved using 1.5% (w/v) ampholine 3.5–10 and 1.0% (w/v)
ampholine 5-8. gels were photopolymerised at room temperature
using riboflavin (0.004% v/v) for at least 8 hr. ief was performed
in a cold room. gels were prefocused for 40 min at 20w constant
power.
after dcc extraction, aliquots of the radioactive supernatants
were loaded near the cathode. a mixture of 9 natural proteins
(bio-rad, hemel hempstead, herts, uk) were used for ph calibration. the runs were carried out for 4 hr at 20w constant power.
after the run, the gels were cut into 2.5 mm slices and each slice
was incubated with toluene scintillation cocktail for 24 hr at room
temperature and radioactivity assayed.
er-dna interactions
electro-mobility shift assay (emsa). emsa was performed
using pure recombinant er␣ and er␤ (calbiochem-novabiochem, nottingham, uk). this preparation was purified from baculovirus expression in insect cell cultures by the manufacturer.
according to the manufacturer, the kd for  xxxd2037xxx  of the purified er␣ is 0.3 nm and the batch dependent specific activity was
approximately 6,000 pmol/mg protein. the er␤ had a similar
specific activity, however no details on the affinity for  xxxd2037xxx 
binding are provided. both receptor preparations were supplied in
defined quantities, which made it possible to compare er␣ and
er␤ at the same receptor concentration.
for emsa, receptor was prepared in 20 mm hepes buffer, ph
7.8, containing 450 mm nacl, 0.4 mm edta, 0.5 mm dtt, 25
% glycerol and 0.5 mm pmsf25 and incubated with a classical
oestrogen response element (ere). two complementary oligonucleotides (amersham) 5⬘-gtccaaagtcaggtcacagtgacctgatcaaagtt-3⬘(sense) and 5⬘-aactttgatcaggtcactgtgacctgactttggac-3⬘(antisense), representing the
ere motif derived from the xenopus vitellogenin gene promoter26,27 were hybridised by heating to 80°c and by allowing to cool
to room temperature. the resultant double-stranded ere was
labelled with [␣-32p]-dctp (sp. activity 3,000 ci/mmol, amersham).
oestrogen receptors, either er␣ or er␤ (160 fmol receptor
protein per reaction), were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the presence of either vehicle alone (1% methanol in
binding buffer: 40 mm hepes, ph 7.4, 100 mm kcl, 2 mm
 xxxd26xxx  and 20% glycerol) containing 0.5% bovine
 xxxg124xxx  and 50 ␮g polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, or containing 17-␤  xxxd2037xxx  (10 nm), with or without tamoxifen (10
␮m) or  xxxd3436xxx  (10 ␮m). after adding radiolabelled ere (1 ng),
the incubation was continued for an additional 15 min at room
temperature and then at 4°c for 30 min.25 samples were fractionated at 4°c on a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (pre-run
for 30 min at 100 v) for 1 hr at 250 v at 4°c. after fixing the gel
in 10% acetic acid:30 % methanol for 15 min, gels were exposed
to x-ray film overnight at ⫺80°c using a kodak intensifying
screen (merck, poole, dorset, uk).
reporter assays. the first reporter system was based on the
 xxxg2041xxx  vector, which with the co-vector ppl-tk is part of the dual
luciferase assay (promega corporation, madison, wi). the covector constitutively produces renilla luciferase and allows reporter data to be corrected for cell number. to regulate luciferase
production, the xenopus ere6 was inserted upstream of the sv40
promoter. a single ere was created by ligating double-stranded
oligonucleotides into saci, nhei restriction sites. these oligonucleotides also contained an at-rich region to increase sensitivity
of the reporter to  xxxd2037xxx .7 mcf-7 cells were grown in mem
with 10% fbs. twenty-four hours prior to transfection, media

non-competitive inhibition of er

were replaced with dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (dmem)
without phenol red and with 10% charcoal-stripped fbs (sera
laboratories, salisbury, uk).
two days before confluence, cells were transfected into 96-well
plates, using the reagent effectene (qiagen) with 37.5 ng reporter
plasmid and 3.75 ng co-vector ppl-tk. at the time of transfection, the ligands 17␤  xxxd2037xxx  (10 nm) alone or with  xxxd3436xxx  at
different concentrations were added to the medium. after 20 hr the
cells were lysed, using lysis buffer provided with the stop and glo
reagents (promega) and frozen at ⫺70°c.
using the stop and glo system, 10 sec readings were taken, first
for luciferase activity and second, after the addition of stop and
glo reagent, for renilla. luciferase values were divided by the
renilla values to give comparable relative light units (rlu).
 xxxd2037xxx  (10 nm) controls were used to standardise responses in
different transfections. results were expressed as percentages of
 xxxd2037xxx  values. readings were taken using an lmax luminometer (molecular devices, wokingham, uk) or a luminoskan
(thermolabsystems, ashford, uk). values for both machines
were consistent when adjusted to 10 nm  xxxd2037xxx  values.
green fluorescent protein (gfp) reporter. the 717 base pair
gene encoding the green fluorescent protein gfpuv (clontech
laboratories, inc., palo alto, ca) was cut from its puc19 vector
using ecori and hindiii, agarose-gel purified and ligated, using
t4 dna ligase, into puc18, cut and purified in the same manner.
this reverses the direction of gfpuv against the lacz promoter
present in both vectors so the promoter cannot stimulate gfpuv
production.
the ere was introduced upstream of gfp with hindiii and
sphi ends. the double-stranded oligonucleotides were phosphorylated by t4 polynucleotide kinase and ligated into the new vector
containing gfpuv, digested with hindiii and sphi and gel purified
as above.
oligonucleotides were designed to place the tata box promoter from the gene encoding ampicillin resistance at an appropriate position relative to the atg of gfp in order to allow gfp
transcription. gfpuv was used as the starting plasmid for amplification of the tata-gfp cassette by pcr. the cassette and its
xtgfp vector were digested using psti and ecori, gel purified
and ligated.
mcf-7 cells were transfected with 50 ng vector using effectene,
with simultaneous addition of the ligands  xxxd2037xxx  and antioestrogens as appropriate. after an additional 24 hr, cells were
washed in phosphate-buffered saline to reduce auto-fluorescence
by the media and then, in order to enhance the gfp signal (which
rapidly degrades once stimulated), they were mounted using prolong antifade (molecular probes europe bv, leiden, netherlands). the slides were then stored overnight in the dark to dry
before viewing, using a 400 – 440 nm filter for gfp excitation and
a 470 nm long pass filter for emission.
results

 xxxd3436xxx  inhibits mcf-7 cell proliferation
cells grown in the presence of  xxxd2037xxx  showed a significant
increase in thymidine labelling when compared to controls and this
was blocked by the presence of  xxxd3436xxx  (fig. 1).
 xxxd3436xxx  changes the kinetics of oestrogen binding to receptors
the presence of  xxxd3436xxx  (10 ␮m) significantly altered the
kinetics of  xxxd2037xxx  binding to rat uterus er, resulting in overall
higher affinity, though without significant change in total specific
binding. although kds varied from preparation to preparation, it
was significantly reduced in the presence of  xxxd3436xxx  by
23.99⫾10.79%, (mean⫾se, n⫽5, p⬍0.01, paired t-test) (fig. 2).
analysis of radiolabelled  xxxd2037xxx  binding to rat uterus cytosol

grown in the presence of  xxxd2037xxx  show a significant increase in

when compared to controls in that binding of labelled  xxxd2037xxx  to
the pi 6.3 isoform specifically was significantly increased by
41.6⫾8.5% (mean⫾se, n⫽5, p⫽0.01, paired t-test). the apparently decreased binding to the pi 6.6 isoform, seen in figure 3, is
variable and not statistically significant. in assays using the in vitro
translated human er, the addition of  xxxd3436xxx  (10 ␮m) significantly increased maximum binding (bmax) for er␤ from
1.31⫾0.41 to 1.67⫾0.47 nm, (n⫽3, p⬍0.05, paired t-test), but
there was no significant effect on bmax for er␣ or on kds for
oestrogen binding to either receptor (data not shown).
emsa:  xxxd3436xxx  reduces er-ere complex formation
cell-free incubations of radiolabelled ere with purified recombinant er␣ resulted in a band shift that corresponded to er␣-ere
complex formation. this occurred even in the absence of added
ligand; however, in the presence of 10 nm  xxxd2037xxx , the intensity
of this band was increased compared to vehicle alone, indicating
an increase in complex formation (fig. 4a). in addition,  xxxd2037xxx

to isoforms focusing at pi 6.1, 6.3, 6.6 and 6.8. in the presence of
 xxxd3436xxx , binding to the isoform at pi 6.3 is significantly increased
(see text). tamoxifen reduces  xxxd2037xxx  binding to all isoforms.

alone (10 ␮m) had no significant effect on either er␣ or er␤ere complex formation and in each case, incubations carried out
in the presence of a 50-fold excess of unlabelled ere eliminated
any detectable band, thus confirming that the radioactive bands
visualised in these experiments was due to complex formation
between purified er and radiolabelled ere (data not shown).
 xxxd3436xxx  reduces  xxxd2037xxx -stimulated gene transcription
using luciferase or gfp ere-linked reporter systems in mcf-7
cells,  xxxd3436xxx  significantly inhibited  xxxd2037xxx  stimulated gene
transcription (figs. 5,6). the clearest effect is  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m, consistent
with the concentration required to show inhibition of tritiated
thymidine uptake or receptor-ere binding in emsa (figs. 1,4).
 xxxd3436xxx  alone (10 ␮m) had no significant effect.

caused a slightly faster migration of the er␣-ere complex, which
is characteristic of a change in er conformation.28 similar observations have been described elsewhere for er␣ and er␤ homodimers.29 the formation of er-ere complex in the absence of
ligand may be a result of the relative excess of purified receptor
used in this cell-free system.
 xxxd3436xxx  (10 ␮m), in the presence of  xxxd2037xxx , reduced the
intensity of the  xxxd2037xxx -augmented band. this effect of
 xxxd3436xxx  was statistically significant (fig. 4b) and was clearly
different from the effect of 10 ␮m tamoxifen (tam), which did
not affect the intensity of the band, though it appeared to prevent
the  xxxd2037xxx -induced conformational change. in addition, 10 ␮m
 xxxd3436xxx  was able to reduce er␤-ere complex formation in a
similar way (fig. 4c,d) in that the intensity of the band was
reduced significantly compared to  xxxd2037xxx  alone. the er␤ homodimer appeared to bind less strongly to the ere.  xxxd3436xxx 

because resistance to antioestrogen therapy is a recognised
complication in breast cancer treatment, there is a requirement for
effective second line endocrine therapy.29 –32  xxxd3436xxx  has already been successfully used in the treatment of postmenopausal
patients whose condition has relapsed following treatment with
tamoxifen.14 –20 however, the mechanism for this beneficial effect
of  xxxd3436xxx  in breast cancer patients is not clearly defined.
the results presented here demonstrate that  xxxd3436xxx  inhibits
er-mediated stimulation of cell proliferation and transcriptional
activation in cell-based reporter assays and that it acts in a manner
quite different from that of other known oestrogen antagonists. not
only does the drug prevent oestrogen-stimulated proliferation in
mcf-7 cells as assayed by tritiated thymidine incorporation (fig.
1), it also inhibits oestrogen stimulated responses in mcf-7 cells
transfected with luciferase or gfp-linked reporter systems (figs.
5,6). these responses are somewhat different, in that the effect was
apparently greater with the gfp than with the luciferase reporters,
but such variation may be expected in view of differences in the
precise constructs and systems used.
that these actions are mediated by direct interaction with both
er␣ and er␤ oestrogen receptors is shown by  xxxd3436xxx ’s ability
to inhibit the oestrogen enhanced binding of pure recombinant er
to a classical ere in the cell-free emsas (fig. 4). this was not
observed in the absence of oestrogen, although more subtle conformational changes cannot be ruled out. it is not clear, however,
what the in vivo implications of a reduction in both the interactions

of er␣ and er␤ with this particular ere might be. a reduction
of er␣-ere complex formation would be likely to lead to an
antioestrogenic beneficial effect and this is consistent with our
other observations in mcf-7 cell proliferation and luciferase reporter assays. however, the impact of our results in terms of the
role of er␤ in breast cancer are not easily accessible from this
data. it has been shown previously and is apparent in the emsa
results, that pure recombinant human er␤ homodimer binds less
well to this ere.28 also, expression of genes containing eres in
their promoters tend to be strongly correlated with er␣ but not
with er␤ in breast tumours.33 er␤ is known to have other actions
that rely on protein-protein interaction, for example, with the  xxxg1222xxx 
complex,33,34 which are not dependent on ere binding and therefore it is not clear how the emsa results can be extrapolated to
interpret the true extent of er␤ involvement in breast cancer.
interestingly, in one study expression of both er␣ and er␤ in
breast tumours suggested a particularly poor prognosis.34

21

the established antioestrogens, such as tamoxifen and  xxxd2165xxx 
780, are competitive inhibitors of oestrogen binding, while
 xxxd3436xxx  clearly has a non-competitive mode of action (figs. 1,2),
which is quite different and is presumably allosteric. allosteric
modulation of er function has previously been postulated to
explain other receptor inhibitor interactions.35–37
not only does  xxxd3436xxx  act noncompetitively, overall affinity of
 xxxd2037xxx  binding is in fact significantly increased by  xxxd3436xxx  in
cytosol preparations of rat uteri (fig. 2). furthermore, we have
previously shown that cytosols from oestrogen-dependent tissues
contain up to 4 isoforms of specific binding sites.24,38 three of
these are monomers and one, at pi 6.1, corresponds to the oligomeric 8s assembly.24 the isoforms at pis of 6.3 and 6.6 are
monomeric proteins of molecular weights approximately 50 and
65 kda, respectively, consistent with those of er␤ and er␣, while
the identity of the isoform at pi 6.8, with a molecular weight of 70
kda, is unclear. in the present experiments (fig. 3), analysis of
binding to these  xxxg730xxx  isoforms shows that  xxxd2037xxx 
binding to the monomeric isoform at pi 6.3 is significantly enhanced by  xxxd3436xxx , suggesting stabilisation of the oestrogenbinding conformation and this is perhaps consistent with the overall increased affinity. some additional evidence for these effects
was obtained from the kinetics of  xxxd2037xxx  binding to expressed
human er in that for  xxxd2037xxx  binding bmax for er␤ (but not for
er␣) was increased by  xxxd3436xxx . however, the kd of neither
interaction were affected, which raises the likelihood that in the rat
uterine preparations, other cellular components undoubtedly contribute to the complexity of the effects.
one possibility is that  xxxd3436xxx  interacts with er directly at the
dna binding domain. this could explain the similar inhibition of
dna binding of both er␣ and er␤, which are 95% identical in
this region: interactions between  xxxd3436xxx  and the n-terminus
(domains a/b) would seem less likely in view of the dissimilarity
between the 2 isoforms in this region.39 against this is the finding
that  xxxd2037xxx  binding to er␤ in rat uteri is enhanced, whereas
binding to er␣ is not, so that an n-terminal effect cannot be
excluded.
the dose-response relationship for  xxxd3436xxx  inhibition of the
ere-luciferase reporter shown in figure 5 demonstrates that the
clearest effect is seen at the highest dose of 10 ␮m, consistent with
the likely levels of  xxxd3436xxx  (or its metabolites) achieved in
patients under the therapeutic regimes that have been used.14 –20
and with the amounts required for inhibition of tritiated thymidine
uptake in mcf7 cells or of receptor binding to ere (figs 1,4).
this does not rule out the possibility of interactions at lower
concentrations, however and it remains possible that in other cell
contexts, or in the presence of ligands other than  xxxd2037xxx ,
 xxxd3436xxx  will prove to have more potent actions than those shown
here.
these data offer a possible explanation for the beneficial actions
of  xxxd3436xxx  in advanced breast cancer, even after previous courses
of anti-hormone therapy when the response to tamoxifen decreases. indeed coupled with the known action of  xxxd3436xxx  in
reducing steroidogenesis40 and given the current interest in such
activity in new drug development,  xxxd3436xxx  may prove to offer
significant therapeutic advantages.
