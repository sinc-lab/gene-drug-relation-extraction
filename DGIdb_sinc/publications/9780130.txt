clinical implications of  xxxg2319xxx --optimization of drug dosage and potential drug interactions.   xxxg2319xxx  ( xxxg2319xxx ) is a cytoplasmic enzyme that preferentially catalyzes the s-methylation of aromatic and heterocyclic sulphydryl compounds, such as the  xxxd2573xxx  drugs azathioprine,  xxxd2573xxx , and  xxxd3352xxx . these drugs form the same terminal metabolites, the  xxxd3352xxx  nucleotides (tgns). one major influence on  xxxd2573xxx  therapy is the inherited activity of  xxxg2319xxx .  xxxg2319xxx  "deficiency" is associated with grossly elevated tgn concentrations and profound toxicity after a short course of  xxxd2573xxx  therapy. variant alleles producing a functional loss of  xxxg2319xxx  activity have now been described. although all the ethnic groups investigated to date have the same wild-type enzyme,  xxxg2319xxx  variant allele frequencies vary. potentially,  xxxg2319xxx  activity can influence a number of compounds that could be coadministered with  xxxd2573xxx  drugs. after a therapeutic dose of aspirin, plasma concentrations of  xxxd3159xxx  are within the range for  xxxg2319xxx  inhibition.  xxxd3255xxx  and its metabolite 5- xxxd153xxx  inhibit  xxxg2319xxx , and concurrent furosemide therapy could influence the s-methylation of thiopurines. in addition,  xxxg2319xxx  could interfere with disulfiram treatment in alcoholism.  xxxg2319xxx  s-methylates the  xxxd1917xxx  metabolite involved in disulfiram activation.
