abstract
phendimetrazine is an effective and widely prescribed appetite suppressant. preclinical findings show that phendimetrazine displays
stimulant properties similar to amphetamine, but few studies have examined the neurochemical mechanism of the drug. in the present work,
we characterize the activity of phendimetrazine and its putative metabolites [ xxxd2907xxx , pseudophenmetrazine, and associated
stereoisomers] at biogenic amine transporters. all drugs were tested in vitro using assays to measure uptake and release of [3h]dopamine,
[3h]norepinephrine, and [3h]serotonin ([3h]5-ht) in rat brain synaptosomes. selected drugs were tested in vivo using microdialysis to
measure extracellular dopamine and serotonin (5-ht) in rat nucleus accumbens. phendimetrazine itself had no effect on uptake or release of
any transmitter. in contrast, the trans-configured n-demethylated metabolite,  xxxd2907xxx , was a potent releaser of [3h]norepinephrine
(ec50 = 50 nm) and [3h]dopamine (ec50 = 131 nm). the cis n-demethylated metabolite, pseudophenmetrazine, displayed modest potency at
releasing [3h]norepinephrine (ec50 = 514 nm) and blocking [3h]dopamine re-uptake (ic50 = 2630 nm). all drugs tested were inactive or
weak in the [3h]5-ht assays. when injected intravenously, phendimetrazine had minimal effects on extracellular transmitter levels, whereas
 xxxd2907xxx  produced dose-related elevations in extracellular dopamine. the collective findings suggest that phendimetrazine is a
‘‘prodrug’’ that is converted to the active metabolite  xxxd2907xxx , a potent substrate for norepinephrine and dopamine transporters. d 2002

1. introduction
phendimetrazine (fig. 1, structure 1) is a clinically
available medication that displays biochemical and behavioral properties similar to amphetamine (corwin et al., 1987;
de la garza and johanson, 1987; evans and johanson,
1987; foltin, 1989; jones and holtzman, 1994). phendimetrazine is approved for short-term use in the treatment of
obesity (bray, 1993; ryan, 2001). additionally, due to its
weak stimulant properties, phendimetrazine might prove
useful as an agonist substitution pharmacotherapy for stimulant addictions (baumann and rothman, 1998; grabowski
et al., 2001; rothman et al., 1998a). following oral administration of phendimetrazine to human subjects, 30% of the
drug dosage is recovered in urine as the n-demethylated

metabolite,  xxxd2907xxx  (fig. 1, structure 2) (beckett and
raisi, 1976). the extent to which  xxxd2907xxx  contributes
to the actions of systemically administered phendimetrazine
is not known. moreover, little information exists on the
precise neurochemical actions of phendimetrazine or  xxxd2907xxx .
preclinical studies indicate that the behavioral effects of
phendimetrazine can be influenced by route of drug administration. when administered by the intraperitoneal (i.p.)
route to rats, phendimetrazine increases locomotor activity
but is much less potent than amphetamine (jones and
holtzman, 1994). drug discrimination studies in monkeys
indicate that orally administered (p.o.) phendimetrazine and
 xxxd2907xxx  are about equipotent in their ability to generalize to the amphetamine stimulus cue (de la garza and
johanson, 1987). interestingly, intravenous (i.v.) phendimetrazine does not support self-administration behavior in
monkeys whereas i.v.  xxxd2907xxx  is readily self-admin-

istered (corwin et al., 1987). taken together, the available
data suggest phendimetrazine might be a ‘‘prodrug’’ that is
metabolized after systemic administration to generate  xxxd2907xxx , the pharmacologically active entity.
the clinically available form of phendimetrazine is a
racemic mixture. both phendimetrazine and  xxxd2907xxx 
contain two chiral centers, with their corresponding methyl
and phenyl substituents oriented in a trans configuration
relative to the morpholine ring (fig. 1, structures 1 and 2).
pseudophenmetrazine (fig. 1, structure 3) contains the same
two chiral centers, but the methyl and phenyl substituents
are oriented in a cis configuration. since little information
exists on the neurochemical actions of phendimetrazine or
its putative metabolites, we sought to determine the activity
of these compounds at biogenic amine transporters. all
drugs were tested in vitro using assays to measure uptake
and release of [3h]dopamine, [3h]norepinephrine, and
[3h]5-ht in rat brain synaptosomes. selected compounds
were tested in vivo using microdialysis to measure extracellular dopamine and 5-ht in rat nucleus accumbens.

2. methods
2.1. animals
male sprague – dawley rats (300 –400 g) were obtained
from charles river laboratories (wilmington, ma). the
animal housing facilities were fully accredited by the
american association of the accreditation of laboratory
animal care (aaalac), and all experiments were performed within the guidelines delineated in the institutional
care and use committee of the national institute on drug
abuse (nida), intramural research program.
2.2. transporter-related assays
the assays used to determine the ability of test drugs to
influence the re-uptake and release of [3h]dopamine,

[3h]norepinephrine, and [3h]5-ht were performed according to published methods (rothman et al., 2000). briefly,
crude synaptosomes were prepared from rat caudate (for
dopamine re-uptake and release assays) or from whole brain
minus caudate (for norepinephrine and 5-ht re-uptake and
release assays) by homogenizing freshly excised tissue in
ice-cold 10% sucrose using 12 strokes of a potter –elvehjem
homogenizer. homogenates were centrifuged at 1000  g
for 10 min. supernatants were retained on ice and used
immediately in re-uptake and release assays.
all assays were performed in krebs– phosphate buffer
(ph 7.4) that contained 154.4 mm nacl, 2.9 mm kcl, 1.1
mm cacl2, 0.83 mm mgcl2, 5 mm glucose, 1 mg/ml
 xxxd228xxx , and 50 am  xxxd2850xxx . for the release assays, 1
am reserpine was added to the sucrose solution and assay
buffer. [3h]norepinephrine re-uptake and release assays
were performed in the presence of 5 nm 3h-(4-iodophenyl)tropane-2h-pyrrolidine carboxamide tartrate (rti-229) to
prevent re-uptake of [3h]norepinephrine into dopaminergic
nerves. [3h]5-ht re-uptake and release assays were performed in the presence of 100 nm  xxxd2746xxx  and 100 nm
gbr12935 to prevent re-uptake of [3h]5-ht into noradrenergic and dopaminergic nerves. incubation times were 15,
10, and 30 min for [3h]dopamine, [3h]norepinephrine, and
[3h]5-ht re-uptake, respectively.
for release assays, synaptosomal preparations were incubated to steady state with 5 nm [3h]dopamine (30 min), 7
nm [3h]norepinephrine (60 min), or 5 nm [3h]5-ht (60
min). synaptosomes preloaded with neurotransmitter were
added to test tubes containing test drugs and incubated for 5
min ([3h]dopamine and [3h]5-ht) or 30 min ([3h]norepinephrine). at the designated time, assays were filtered using
a packard filtermate harvester. non-displaceable tritium
was measured by conducting incubations in the presence of
10 am tyramine for [3h]dopamine and [3h]norepinephrine
release and 100 am tyramine for [3h]5-ht release. the
filters were dried for 1 h at 60 jc and counted using the
packard topcount-nxtk microplate scintillation and
luminescence counter.

[3h]dopamine, [3h]5-ht, and [3h]norepinephrine re-uptake and release assays were conducted as described in methods. values are means of three
experiments f s.d.

2.3. in vivo microdialysis

5-ht ranged from 18% to 20%. drug solutions were
prepared immediately before use and doses are expressed
as the salt.

surgical implantation of indwelling jugular catheters and
intra-accumbens guide cannulae was carried out as previously described (baumann et al., 1994). on the evening
prior to testing, extension tubes were connected to catheters,
and microdialysis probes (2  0.5 mm exchange surface,
cma/12, cma/microdialysis) were inserted into the nucleus accumbens via the guide cannulae. dialysis probes
were perfused in situ overnight with artificial cerebrospinal
fluid (acsf) containing 150 mm nacl, 3 mm kcl, 1.4 mm
cacl2, and 0.8 mm mgcl2, pumped at a flow rate of 1.0 al/
min. the next morning dialysate samples were collected at
20-min intervals. samples were immediately assayed for
endogenous dopamine and 5-ht using high-pressure liquid
chromatography, as described elsewhere (baumann et al.,
2000). three baseline samples were collected and subsequent dopamine and 5-ht measures were expressed as a
percent of this baseline. probe recoveries of dopamine and

determination of ic50 values (for inhibition of re-uptake)
and ec50 values (for stimulation of release) were carried out
using the nonlinear least-squares curve-fitting program
mlab-pc (civilized software, bethesda, md), as previously described. in the release assays, ‘‘specific’’ displaceable tritium was calculated as the difference between total
retained tritium and non-displaceable tritium. in some
instances, test drugs increased non-displaceable tritium;
when this occurred, the non-displaceable tritium was measured for each test drug concentration. ki values were
calculated from ic50 or ec50 values using published methods (rothman et al., 1998b). in some release experiments,
the apparent ki of transporter blocking agents was deter-

ered baseline and all subsequent monoamine measures were
expressed as a percent of this baseline. data were evaluated
by one-way analysis of variance with repeated measures.
sources of reagents and chemicals are published (rothman
et al., 2001). the synthesis of  xxxd2907xxx  and its stereoisomers will be described (manuscript in preparation).

3. results
3.1. in vitro experiments
racemic phendimetrazine (1) was essentially inactive at
[3h]dopamine, [3h]norepinephrine, and [3h]5-ht uptake
inhibition and release (table 1). the most potent effect of 1
was inhibition of [3h]norepinephrine uptake, with an ic50
of 8300 nm. racemic  xxxd2907xxx  (2), and both of its
stereoisomers ((+)- and ( )-2), released [3h]dopamine
more potently than they inhibited [3h]dopamine uptake.
their releasing ability displayed stereoselectivity, since (+)2 was more potent at [3h]dopamine release (ec50 = 87 nm)
than ( )-2 (ec50 = 415 nm).  xxxd2907xxx  released
[3h]norepinephrine more potently than it inhibited [3h]norepinephrine uptake, and this effect was also stereoselective.
as noted with other substrate-type stimulants (rothman et
al., 2000, 2001), 2 and its stereoisomers were more potent at
stimulating [3h]norepinephrine release than [3h]dopamine
release. for example, ( )-2 was 6.6-fold more potent in the
[3h]norepinephrine release assay (ec50 = 62.9 nm) than in
the [3h]dopamine release assay (ec50 = 415 nm). 2 released
[3h]5-ht with an ec50 value of 7800 nm, indicating that
these compounds are about 100-fold more potent at releasing norepinephrine than releasing 5-ht.

reported in fig. 3, 10 nm indatraline, which by itself had
minimal activity in the [3h]dopamine release assay, shifted
the (+)-2 dose –response curve to the right. based on the
degree of shift, the apparent ki of indatraline for the
 xxxg2149xxx  was calculated to be 1.4 nm, which
is similar to what we reported previously (rothman et al.,
2000). to verify the substrate activity of 2, (+)-2, ( )-2 and
(+)-3, approximately ed80 concentrations were tested in the
[3h]norepinephrine and [3h]dopamine release assays in the
absence and presence of 10 nm indatraline. as reported in
fig. 4, indatraline reversed the releasing activity of all these
agents, indicating that they are transporter substrates.
it is of interest that the stereoisomers ( )-3 and (+)-3
interact at the  xxxg2149xxx  as uptake inhibitor and

7 rats).

racemic pseudophenmetrazine (3), and both of its stereoisomers ((+) and ( )-3), were at least 10-fold weaker
at releasing [3h]norepinephrine when compared to the
 xxxd2907xxx  analogs. the norepinephrine-releasing activity of (+)-3 (ec50 = 349 nm) was 10-fold more potent than
( )-3 (ec50 = 2511 nm). whereas 3 and ( )-3 were weak
[3h]dopamine uptake inhibitors (ic50 values of about 2.7
am), (+)-3 was a weak [3h]dopamine releaser. 3 and its
stereoisomers were essentially inactive in releasing [3h]5ht. interestingly, 3 increased the non-displaceable retained
tritium. this is illustrated in fig. 2 for [3h]norepinephrine
release. as described, the non-displaceable tritium was
measured for each test drug concentration.
dose – response shift experiments were conducted to
verify the substrate activity of selected compounds. as

substrate, respectively. to further verify these findings, we
determined the ability of ( )-3 to shift the (+)-3 dose –
response curve to the right. as reported in fig. 5, 2 am
( )-3, which by itself had minimal effects in the [3h]dopamine release assay, shifted the (+)-3 dose – response curve
to the right. based on the degree of shift, the apparent ki of
( )-3 for the  xxxg2149xxx  was calculated to be
1025 nm, which is similar to its reported ki for inhibiting
[3h]dopamine uptake (2691 nm, table 1). the ability of
( )-3 to block the [3h]dopamine releasing effect of (+)-3
may explain why the racemic mixture tests as a dopamine
uptake inhibitor.
3.2. in vivo microdialysis experiments
we determined the ability of 1 and (+)-2 to increase
extracellular dopamine and 5-ht via local infusion of the
drugs into the n. accumbens since this route of administration avoids metabolism. as reported in fig. 6, 1 failed to
increase extracellular dopamine or 5-ht levels. in contrast,
(+)-2 increased extracellular dopamine, and extracellular 5ht to a lesser extent, in a dose-dependent manner. as
reported in fig. 7, when administered i.v., 1 failed to
increase extracellular dopamine or 5-ht, whereas (+)-2
significantly increased extracellular dopamine at both the
1 mg/kg ( f(2,12) = 44.42, p < 0.0001) and 3 mg/kg
( f(2,12) = 78.54, p < 0.0001) doses. (+)-2 significantly
increased extracellular 5-ht only at the 3 mg/kg dose
( f(2,12) = 10.02, p < 0.01).

4. discussion
the purpose of the current study was to clarify the
neurochemical mechanism of action of the clinically available appetite suppressant, phendimetrazine. it has been
established that orally administered phendimetrazine is
metabolized to  xxxd2907xxx  in human subjects (beckett
and raisi, 1976), but the role of the metabolite in mediating
pharmacological effects of systemically administered phendimetrazine is not known. studies in monkeys show that i.v.
phendimetrazine does not support self-administration
behavior, whereas the metabolite  xxxd2907xxx  is readily
self-administered. (corwin et al., 1987). these observations,
coupled with the behavioral data mentioned in introduction,
led us to hypothesize that phendimetrazine is a prodrug that
produces its stimulant effects via generation of the active
metabolite,  xxxd2907xxx . the data reported here fully
support the prodrug hypothesis.
when tested in vitro, phendimetrazine was essentially
inactive at dopamine, norepinephrine, and 5-ht transporters. by contrast, the n-demethylated metabolite  xxxd2907xxx  was a potent substrate-type releaser at dopamine
transporters (ec50 = 131 nm) and norepinephrine transporters (ec50 = 50 nm). when administered locally into the n.
accumbens via reverse dialysis so as to avoid metabolism,

(+)-phendimetrazine failed to elevate extracellular dopamine
or 5-ht. locally applied (+)- xxxd2907xxx , on the other
hand, increased extracellular dopamine in a dose-dependent
manner. finally, i.v. phendimetrazine failed to elevate
extracellular dopamine or 5-ht, whereas equivalent doses
of (+)- xxxd2907xxx  produced a large and dose-dependent
increase in extracellular dopamine.
interestingly, local administration of (+)- xxxd2907xxx 
into the n. accumbens elevated extracellular 5-ht, despite
the fact that the drug has more than 30-fold greater potency
at releasing dopamine than 5-ht (table 1). this apparent
discrepancy might arise because local drug administration
creates a concentration gradient, where neurons closer to the
probe are exposed to higher drug concentrations than
neurons further away from the probe. upon systemic drug
administration, in contrast, all neurons in the area around
the probe are exposed to the same drug concentration. in the
present local administration experiments, we speculate that
neurons in the area immediately surrounding the probe are
exposed to high enough concentrations of (+)- xxxd2907xxx  to stimulate release of 5-ht. as the concentration of
(+)- xxxd2907xxx  in the perfusate is increased, more neurons in a ‘‘cylinder of influence’’ are exposed to the
threshold concentration of the drug and the level of 5-ht
in the dialysate increases. consistent with this notion, i.v.
administration of (+)- xxxd2907xxx  increased extracellular
5-ht a modest 3-fold (fig. 7) at the highest dose tested (3
mg/kg). we plan studies to determine the effect of phendimetrazine and (+)- xxxd2907xxx  on extracellular norepinephrine.
as a clinically available central nervous system (cns)
stimulant, phendimetrazine represents a potential agonist
substitution pharmacotherapy for cocaine addiction. theoretically, stimulant-type appetite suppressants like phendimetrazine might normalize cocaine-dysregulated neurochemistry and thereby facilitate abstinence (baumann and
rothman, 1998; grabowski et al., 2001; rothman et al.,
1998a). our data indicate that phendimetrazine generates
two active compounds, (+) and ( ) stereoisomers, which
release dopamine and norepinephrine. since peripheral
administration of  xxxd2907xxx  elevates extracellular levels
of 5-ht only at very high doses, therapeutic doses of the
drug would not be expected to normalize the 5-ht deficit
seen in cocaine withdrawal states (baumann and rothman,
1998). thus, phendimetrazine and its metabolites may not
be the medicines of choice for treating cocaine dependence.
the stereoisomers of  xxxd2907xxx  are about five to
seven times more potent at releasing norepinephrine than
dopamine, suggesting the predominant effect of phendimetrazine is to release norepinephrine. this observation provides further evidence that norepinephrine may play an
important role in mediating stimulant-induced subjective
effects in humans (rothman et al., 2001). in this regard, it
would be of interest to determine, in humans, the effect of
phendimetrazine on dopamine-mediated pharmacological
effects such as suppression of plasma prolactin secretion

and displacement of radiolabeled raclopride-binding using
positron emission tomography (villemagne et al., 1999).
stereochemistry was found to have a striking affect on
transporter activity. the trans-configured stereoisomers
(i.e., phenmetrazines) were potent dopamine and norepinephrine releasers, whereas the cis stereoisomers (i.e.,
pseudophemetrazines) were weaker in this regard. a more
interesting finding was that pseudophenmetrazine stereoisomers differed in their precise mode of interaction with
dopamine transporters. specifically, ( )-pseudophenmetrazine was a dopamine uptake inhibitor while (+)-pseudophenmetrazine was a dopamine releaser. to our knowledge,
this is the first example of stereoisomers that exhibit this
type of differential activity at the dopamine transporters.
viewed collectively, these results strongly suggest that
phendimetrazine is a prodrug, generating the active metabolite,  xxxd2907xxx .  xxxd2907xxx  is a substrate for the
norepinephrine and dopamine transporters. the low potency
of  xxxd2907xxx  for releasing 5-ht in comparison to
releasing norepinephrine suggests that phendimetrazine (or
 xxxd2907xxx ) would not be expected to normalize
cocaine-induced neurochemical dysregulation, but could
be useful for treating attention deficit disorder. methylphenidate, the most common treatment for attention deficit
disorder, is a potent inhibitor of norepinephrine and dopamine uptake (biederman and spencer, 1999). in regards to
its use as an anorectic agent, our data suggest that therapeutic doses of phendimetrazine would release both dopamine and norepinephrine, unlike phentermine, which
would be expected to selectively release norepinephrine
(rothman et al., 2001). thus, our data suggest that phendimetrazine and phentermine may produce different neurochemical effects at therapeutic doses in humans.
