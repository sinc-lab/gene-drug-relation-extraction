where l is the toxin, r is the receptor-binding site, l.r is a reversible
complex between the toxin and the binding site, l-r is an irreversible
complex betweenthe toxin and the binding site, and kl and k3 are the
reversible affinity and themaximum irreversible rate constants, respectively (kitz and wilson, 1962; culver et al., 1984).thus, a plot of k,,,
versus bipinnatin concentration for each site wouldbe described by
equation 5. equation 5 describes a hyperbolic plot in which the maximum k,,, is equal to k3 and the concentration of toxin (ili) at halfmaximal k,,, is equal t o kl.
k,,, = ks[lv(kl+ p i )

(eq. 5)

if kl>> [ll, then equation 5 reduces to equation 6 (kitz and wilson,
1962;krantz et al., 1991).a plot of k,,, versus [ll forequation 6 yields
a straight line in which the slope(kdk,) has the same units as a
second-orderrate constant (kznd).however, sincethe interaction of the
bipinnatins with nicotinic receptors is presumed to include an initial
reversible binding step, kand is more appropriately referred to as a
bimolecular reaction constant rather than a bimolecular (or secondorder) rate constant (main, 1964; berman and leonard, 1989).

results

the apparent affinity of bipinnatin-b for torpedo nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors increaseswith incubation times between l and 4 h, consistent with theirreversible activity of the
toxin (abramsonet al., 1991b). however, no further increase in
apparent affinity occurs with incubation times longer than 4 h,
leading to the suggestion that bipinnatin-b is chemically unstable in aqueous
buffer. similar conclusions were reached with
respect to the stability of lophotoxin (culver et al., 1984). to
investigate this phenomenon further, the bipinnatins (fig. 1)
were preincubated in buffer for up t o 8 h prior to incubation
with nicotinic receptors on bc3h-1 cells. if the toxins are
chemically unstable in buffer, then the apparent pseudo firstorder rate constant(k,,,) of irreversible receptor inhibition by
the toxins would be expected to decrease as the effective concentration of the toxins decreased.however, the k,,, values for
bipinnatin-a, -b, and -c actually increased with preincubation
of the toxins (fig. 2, a x ) . thus, preincubation of the bipinnatins in aqueous
solution resulted inactivation of the toxins to
more effective irreversible inhibitorsof nicotinic receptors.
the k,,, values for the activated bipinnatinsreached maximum levels within -2 h of preincubation (data notshown). the
k,,, values for bipinnatin-b and-c declined with preincubation
times longer than 2 h, while the k,,, values for bipinnatin-a
remained relatively stable for up to 8 h of preincubation in
buffer. the relatively rapid rise in the kapp values for the bipinnatins to maximum levels within 2 h of preincubation suggests that the parenttoxins undergo activation by preincubation in buffer with a relatively short half-life
< 2 h).

lines through the data from the
preincubated toxins were determined from nonlinear regression of a
double pseudo first-order exponential decay function.

it ispossible that theobserved increase in inhibitory activity
of the bipinnatins is a result of the combined interactions of
both the parent and activated
toxins withthe nicotinic receptor.
if so, then supplementing preincubated toxin with fresh toxin
prior to incubation with receptors would be expected to result
in a faster rateof irreversible inhibition.however, supplementing preincubated bipinnatin-b with fresh toxin did not result in
a significant increase in the subsequent rate of irreversible
inhibition (fig. 3). a slight increase in theinhibition rate was
observed at longer incubation times,but thiswould be expected
due to the generation
of additional activated bipinnatin-b during incubation of the fresh toxin with the receptors. thus, the
action of neither the parenttoxin northe activated species was
enhanced by the presence of the other. furthermore, the addition of fresh bipinnatin-b did not reduce the k,,, for the activated bipinnatin-b, indicating that the parent
species of bipinnatin-b was unable to prevent the
irreversible inhibition of
nicotinic receptors by the activated toxin species.
bipinnatin-a and -c exhibited a 10-20-min delay in the irreversible inhibition of nicotinic receptors, suggesting that the
parent species of these toxins are also inactive as irreversible
inhibitors (fig. 2, a and c ) . the initial reversible binding of
fresh and preincubated toxins can be compared by examining
the ability of these toxins to slow the initial rateof i251-a-btx
binding to nicotinic receptors. fresh preparations of bipinnatin-a, -b, and -c were unable to slow the initial rate of

activated toxins produced by preincubation of bipinnatin-a and
-b in buffer slowed the initial rate of 1251-a-btx binding (fig.
4, a and b).the activated toxin produced by preincubation of
bipinnatin-c did not compete effectively with lz5i-a-btxfor
the acetylcholine-binding sites (fig. 4c). the ability of the activated products of the toxins to reduce the initial rate of 1251a-btx binding decreased in the order bipinnatin-b > bipinnatin-a > bipinnatin-c.
a notable feature of the irreversible inhibition of nicotinic
receptors by the bipinnatins is thatreceptor inhibition consistently occurred with two distinct rates(fig. 2(a<) and fig. 3).
several explanations may account for the observation of two
different kapp values. for example, a significant loss of active
toxin during incubationwith
the receptor (resulting from
chemical degradation, cellularmetabolism, or sequestration
into cellular lipid) could result in an apparentbiphasic inhibition curve (ashani et al., 1972; rakitzis, 1974). alternatively, it
is possible that preincubation of the bipinnatins results in
two
or more activated toxin species that can irreversibly inhibit a
homogeneous population of acetylcholine-binding sites at different rates. a third possibility is that the two acetylcholinebinding sites on each nicotinic receptor have different affinities
for a single, relatively stable, active toxin species produced by
preincubation of the bipinnatins.
to investigate these possibilities, nicotinic receptors were
exposed to preincubated bipinnatin-b t o irreversibly inhibit
64.6 2 1.7%of the total population of acetylcholine-binding
sites andwere then washed to remove unbound toxin. if loss of
activated toxin is significant over the course of receptor inhibition or if more than one activated toxin species is produced by
preincubation of toxin, then inhibition of the remaining sites
by
a second preparation of preincubated bipinnatin-b should also
result intwo apparent ratesof irreversible inhibition. however,
if a single activated toxin species is produced during preincubation that has different affinities for the two acetylcholinebinding sites, theninhibition of the remaining sites
by a second
preparation of preincubated bipinnatin-b should result in one
apparent rate of irreversible inhibition. inhibition of the remaining acetylcholine-binding sites by a second preparation of
preincubated bipinnatin-b resulted inone apparent rate of irreversible inhibition (fig. 5). the k,,, for the inhibition of the
remaining acetylcholine-binding sites by bipinnatin-b (0.035 5

inhibition similar to the
k,,, determined for the slower inactivating siteof intact receptors at the sameconcentration of toxin
(data not shown). thus, bipinnatin-a and -b preferentially inhibit the same binding site on the receptor. these results are
consistent with the hypothesis that
preincubation of the bipinnatins produces a single, relatively stable, activated toxin species that irreversibly inhibits the two acetylcholine-binding
sites of the nicotinic receptor a t two different rates.
 xxxd2625xxx  is a reversible antagonist thatalso discriminates
between the two acetylcholine-binding sites on the nicotinic
receptor (sine and taylor, 1980).  xxxd2625xxx  displayed ec5,,
values of 0.893 2 0.375 and 42.6 2 5.56 p~ for the two binding
sites on the nicotinic receptor (fig. 6). the fractions of these
two binding sites were 57.7 r 3.57% (high affinity sites) and
42.3 2 3.57% (low affinity sites). the bindingof  xxxd2625xxx  to
one of the two acetylcholine-binding sites was investigatedafter selective irreversible inhibition of the other site by bipinnatin-b. receptors were exposed to preincubated bipinnatin-b
to irreversibly inhibit 61.0 2 1.27% of the total population of
acetylcholine-binding sites and were then washed to remove
unbound toxin.  xxxd2625xxx  displayed a single ec50of 1.02 2
0.413 p~ for the remaining binding siteson the receptor (fig.
6).thus, exposure tobipinnatin-b preferentially inhibited
those binding siteson the nicotinic receptor that exhibited low
affinity for  xxxd2625xxx .
sine and claudio (1991) recently describedthe properties of
mouse a z p y z - and  xxxd530xxx &nicotinic acetylcholine receptors stably
expressed in mouse fibroblast cells. the a2pyz- and azp&-receptors are functional, and each displays one pharmacologically homogeneous population of acetylcholine-binding sites,
although, presumably, each receptor still retains two functional
binding sites (sine and claudio, 1991). thus, the a2py2- and
azps2-receptors can be used to further investigate the
kinetics
of irreversible inhibition of nicotinic receptors free from the
complicating influence of two classes of binding sites. inhibition of the azpy2- and azpsz-receptors by activatedbipinnatin-b resulted ina single rate of irreversible inhibition, consistent with the inhibition of a homogeneous population of
receptor sites by a single, relatively stable, activatedtoxin (fig.
7). the kapp values of bipinnatin-b for the azpi&-receptor
(kzpp= 0.461 2 0.051 at 20 p~ bipinnatin-b) and the azpyzreceptor (kipp = 0.136 2 0.025 a t 100 p~ bipinnatin-b) were
similar to k:pp and k:,,, respectively, for the same concentrations of bipinnatin-b for the wild-type receptor (kipp= 0.325 r
0.034; k:pp = 0.131 2 0.015).

the inhibition of each binding site increased as bipinnatin-b
increased over a 20-fold concentration range, but did not show
saturation even at the highestpossible concentrations of toxin
(fig. 8). in addition, the k,,, values approximately doubled
upon increasing the concentrations of bipinnatin-a and -c from
50 to 100 p ~ indicating
,
that these toxins were also not at
saturating concentrations (table i). the concentration range
investigated for bipinnatin-a and -c was limited to higher concentrations because of the extended times necessary to investigate theslower rates of receptor inhibition that resultedfrom
lower concentrations of these two toxins. indeed, k:,, for bipinnatin-c at 50 p~ could not be resolved due to the extentof toxin
degradation over the course of the assay.
because of these considerations, the reversible affinities( k l )
and the maximum irreversible rates of inhibition (k3)for the
bipinnatins could not be determined using equation5. therefore, the bimolecular reaction constants (kindand kind)for the
inhibition of the two binding sites on the nicotinic receptors by
the bipinnatins were determined using equation 6 (table 11).
the measuredbimolecular reaction constants decreased in the
order bipinnatin-b> bipinnatin-a > bipinnatin-c for the binding sites on the nicotinic receptor. not surprisingly, the bimolecular reactionconstants ktndand k&,dfor the azps2- and azpyzreceptors
were
similarto

bipinnatin-b for the wild-type receptors (table 11).
discussion

preincubation of bipinnatin-a, -b, and -c in aqueous buffer
resulted in the production of toxins (tl,z < 2 h) that aremore
active irreversible inhibitors of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors than the parent toxin species. with preincubation of the
bipinnatins in buffer, an increase in inhibitory activity was
observed that reached a maximum within-2 h and then either
declined (bipinnatin-b and-c) or remained relatively stable for
up to 8 h (bipinnatin-a). the resultsobtained for bipinnatin-b
are consistent with the observations ofabramsonet ae. (1991b),
who reported that the apparent affinity of bipinnatin-b does
not continue to increase with incubation times greater than
-4 h.
the parent species of bipinnatin-a, -b, and -c appeared to
have little,if any, affinity for the acetylcholine-binding sites on
the nicotinic receptor. first, fresh bipinnatin-a and -c demon-

not only do the structural differences among the bipinnatins
influence the rates at which the different toxins inhibit the
same binding site, they
also influencethe extent to
which each
toxin can discriminate between the two acetylcholine-binding
sites on the samereceptor. it is important tonote that the ratio
of the kznd values for the two binding sites for each toxin is
independent of toxin concentration. with respect
to thebinding
of the bipinnatins, the ratio
of the kznd values is characteristic
of the extent of the structural disimilarity between the two
sites. bipinnatin-b appears to be more sensitive to the structural differences between the two binding sites on the nicotinic
receptor than is bipinnatin-a. it may be possible, given the
discrimination the bipinnatinsdisplay betweenthe two binding
sites, to design a drug based on the structure of the activated
toxins that canbind exclusively to one site. site-selective drugs
such as the bipinnatins will be useful in the pharmacological
characterization of the growing familyof nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors, some of which presumably display only a single class
of binding sites(conroy et al., 1992; sargent, 1993; vernallis et
al., 1993). the unique ability of the bipinnatins to selectively
for covalent modification may also be useful for
target t~i-''~
investigating the effects that site-directed mutations of each
acetylcholine-binding site may have on receptor function.
the binding sites on the a2pyz- and azps2-receptors (sine
and claudio, 1991) were inhibited by bipinnatin-b at the same
rates as their respective binding sites on the wild-type receptors. this isconsistent with dose-response data of bipinnatin-b
against these receptors (sine and claudio, 1991). as with the
wild-typereceptors, bipinnatin-b irreversiblyinhibited
the
azp6z-receptor, with a n -17-fold higher kznd than that for the
azpyz-receptor. these data confirm that the bipinnatins preferentially inhibit the acetylcholine-binding site located at or
near the d6subunitinterface. in addition, these data suggest
that, with respect to the binding of bipinnatin-b, contacts between the bipinnatins and amino acids in the binding pockets
of the azpyz- and az/36z-receptorsare not greatly affected by the
loss of the corresponding 6- or y-subunits. furthermore, the
bimolecular reaction constants for the binding sites on the wildtype receptor and theazpyz- and azpsz-receptorsare the same,
suggesting that there is no cooperativity between sites with
respect to the binding of the bipinnatins to the wild-type receptor.

between the bipinnatins and tyrlgo awaits determination of
the structures of the activated toxins produced by preincubation of the parent toxins. in addition, a comparison of the

design of drugs that can
