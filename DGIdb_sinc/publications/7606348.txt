1 in order to clarify whether atypical or p,3-adrenoceptors can modulate canine colonic motility in vivo,
studied the effects of sr 5861 1a (a selective agonist for atypical p-adrenoceptors) alone and after
pretreatment with p-adrenoceptor antagonists on colonic motility in the conscious dog. the gastrocolonic response (postprandial increase in motility) was monitored by means of electrodes and

strain-gauge force transducers chronically implanted along the distal colon.- in

some

experiments,

heart

rate was also measured. the possible role of p3-adrenoceptors in mediating the effects of sr 5861 1a was
also tested in vitro in circular muscle strips taken from the canine distal colon.
2 intravenous infusion of sr 5861 ia,  xxxd3130xxx  or  xxxd2398xxx  at doses inducing the same degree of
tachycardia inhibited the gastrocolonic response to a different extent, with sr 5861 ia and  xxxd3130xxx 

being more effective than  xxxd2398xxx .
3 in a dose-response study, sr 5861 1a was more potent in inhibiting colonic motility than in inducing
tachycardia: the ed35 values for inhibition of colonic motility and induction of tachycardia were 23 and
156 jgkg-', i.v., respectively.
4 the inhibitory effect of sr 5861 1a i00 lg kg-', i.v., on the gastrocolonic response was reversed by
 xxxd123xxx  (non-selective p-adrenoceptor antagonist), but resistant to cgp 20712a (p3-adrenoceptor
antagonist) or ici 118551 (p2-adrenoceptor antagonist).
5
in vitro, sr 58611a concentration-dependently relaxed circular muscle strips, an effect that was
competitively antagonized by  xxxd123xxx  with a pa2 value of 7.1, but resistant to cgp 20712a (100 nm),
ici 118551 (100nm) or tetrodotoxin (1 lm).
6 the present study provides strong functional evidence for a role of atypical or p3-adrenoceptors in
the modulation of canine colonic motility both in vivo and in vitro by an inhibitory effect most likely at
the smooth muscle level.

introduction
were originally divided into p1- and p2subtypes on the basis of agonist potency (lands et al.,
1967a,b). more recently, pharmacological studies have suggested the existence of atypical or p3-adrenoceptors, which
are characterized by resistance to classical p-adrenoceptor
antagonists and are stimulated by novel agonists such as sr
58611a (for review, see arch & kaumann, 1993). several
lines of evidence suggest the presence of atypical or p3adrenoceptors mediating relaxation at different gut-levels in
the rat, guinea-pig and rabbit (bond & clarke, 1987; 1988;
bianchetti & manara, 1990; blue et al., 1990; mclaughlin &
macdonald, 1990; norman & leathard, 1990; croci et al.,
1991, taneja & clarke, 1992; growcott et al., 1993a,b; de
boer et al., 1993; macdonald & lamont, 1993). however,
most of these studies were performed in vitro and no data are
available on the possible role of p3-adrenoceptors in the
modulation of canine colonic motility in vivo.
in dogs, as in man, meal ingestion induces the so-called
'gastrocolonic response', i.e. an increase in colonic motility
starting within a few minutes and lasting several hours postprandially (sarna, 1991). this excitatory response is well
reproducible (sarna & lang, 1989) and therefore particularly
suitable when one wants to evaluate the effects of drugs, such
as p-adrenoceptor agonists, which inhibit colonic motility. a
study carried out in the dog isolated colon showed a low
apparent pa2 value -for antagonism of  xxxd2398xxx  by propranolol (grivegnee et al., 1984). because this is now an

established hallmark of atypical, ps-type adrenoceptors (arch
& kaumann, 1993; emorine -et al., 1994), we decided to
study the effects of sr 5861 1a (a selective agonist for p3adrenoceptors, bianchetti & manara, 1990) on the gastrocolonic response in the conscious dog (monitoring heart
rate at the same time) and compare its effects with those of
 xxxd2398xxx  (non-selective p-adrenoceptor agonist) and  xxxd3130xxx  (p2-adrenoceptor agonist). the possible role of padrenoceptors in mediating the effect of sr58611a was also
tested by using selective antagonists in vivo and in isolated
colonic circular muscle strips.
a preliminary account of these data was presented at the
vi" joint meeting between the british and italian societies of
pharmacology (de ponti et al., 1994b).

methods

experimental model
all experiments were carried out according to the guidelines,
set forth by eec directive 86/609 on the care and use iof
experimental animals. five female- mixed breed dogs
(18-22 kg body weight), purchased from an authorized local
breeder (bmg allevamento, cividate al piano, bergamo,
italy) were used. the animals were operated upon under
general pentobarbitone anaesthesia (pentobarbitone sodium,
30 mg kg-1, i.v.) with aseptic techniques and assisted respiration (respiration pump model 16/24, palmer ltd,. london,
england). through a midline laparotomy, we implanted five

1448

f. de ponti et al

bipolar electrodes (nichrome wire, 0.12 mm in diameter,
driver harris, rho, milan, italy) along the distal colon.
atropine (100 tg kg-, i.v.) was administered after
abdominal incision to minimize shortening of the bowel due
to handling. all wires had been inserted previously into a
silastic tube (inside diameter, 1.47 mm; outside diameter,
1.96 mm, medical grade tubing, dow corning corporation,
midland, mi, u.s.a.) and soldered to the terminal of a
multi-pin connector. electrodes were placed as follows: the
fifth electrode (e5) was implanted 8-12 cm from the anal
verge, the fourth electrode (e4) was placed 3 cm proximal to
e5, the third electrode (e3) 5 cm proximal to e4 and finally
the second and first electrodes (e2 and el) 3 and 6 cm
proximal to e3, respectively. a strain-gauge force transducer
(type ea-06-09odg-120, micro-measurements, raleigh, nc,
u.s.a.) was implanted between e3 and e4.
the wires connected to the strain-gauge and the tube
containing the electrodes were exteriorized in the midscapular
region through a subcutaneous tunnel. to avoid infection,
the point of exit of the wires and the tube was cleansed daily.
antibiotic prophylaxis consisted of i.m. vettrimicina (vetem,
milan, italy: 10,000 iu, kg-' day-' of penicillin and
10 mg kg-' day-' of dihydrostreptomycin) for three days
after surgery.

experimental procedure
after allowing a period of 2 weeks for recovery from surgery,
the fasted, conscious animals were studied while comfortably
standing in a sling. intestinal myoelectrical and mechanical
activities were recorded by a multi-channel recorder ( xxxd1097xxx  1,

sensormedics, anaheim, ca, u.s.a.). myoelectrical activity

was recorded with a time constant of 0.03 s and stored
simultaneously by a computer system (compaq deskpro 386s
computer, provided with a 110 mbyte hard disk) for later

analysis via software. after monitoring colonic motility for at
least 2 h, treatments were administered intravenously as
detailed below (see experimental design). the standard meal
was administered during a quiescent phase of motility. it
consisted of 3 cans (405 g each) of pedigree pal (unisabi, st.
denis de l'hotel, france), corresponding to -1,000 kcal,
and was invariably consumed within 5 min. colonic motility
was then monitored for at least 3 h after meal administration.
in some experiments, in,order to monitor heart rate, electrocardiographic recordings were obtained at the following
times: -5, 0 (control, immediately before p-adrenoceptor
agonist administration), 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80
and 90 min after the start of the i.v. infusion or after i.v.
bolus injection of the p-adrenoceptor agonist being tested. at
the same times, in some experiments with sr 5861 ia, systolic blood pressure was measured by the tail-cuff method
(blood pressure recorder, model 8006, basile, comerio,
italy).

experimental design and data analysis
four sets of experiments were carried out in vivo on each
dog, allowing an interval of at least 3 days between two
experimental sessions with the same dog.
in the first set of experiments we assessed the gastrocolonic
response in each dog by administering intravenously, in random order to each animal, 1o ml of 154 mm nacl (control)
or 300 tg kg-' atropine 15 min before the standard meal.
atropine was used as a reference drug, for its ability to
inhibit the colonic motor response to a meal (sarna, 1991)
and for its well-known positive chronotropic effect. the dose
of atropine chosen had previously been found to be a supramaximal dose in increasing heart rate in the dog (de ponti
et al., 1993).
in the second set of experiments, we evaluated the colonic
and chronotropic effects of sr 58611a,  xxxd2398xxx  and
 xxxd3130xxx . sr 5861 1a (10 tg kg-' min-'),  xxxd2398xxx 

colonic motility and 1-adr.noceptors

(o.1l gkg-'min-') or  xxxd3130xxx  (10agkg-'min-') were randomly administered to each dog via -a 30 min i.v. infusion
(0.5 ml min-'), starting 15 min before the standard meal.
these doses (having approximately the same positive
chronotropic effect) were chosen on the basis of pilot
experiments.
in the third set of experiments, we carried out doseresponse studies with sr 58611a (10, 30, 100 and
300 ggkg-'). the treatments were randomly administered to
each dog as an i.v. bolus 15 min before the standard
meal.
in the fourth set of experiments, we assessed the effects of
p-adrenoceptor antagonists on colonic motility and on the
inhibitory effect of sr 5861 1a. in each dog,  xxxd123xxx , cgp
20712a (pi-adrenoceptor antagonist, dooley et al., 1986) or
ici 118551 (02-adrenoceptor antagonist, bilski et al., 1983)
were randomly infused intravenously for 1 h, starting 45 min
before the meal. each antagonist was administered at the
dose of 300 gg kg-', i.v. bolus immediately followed by
300 ilg kg-' h-' infusion (infusion rate: 10 ml h-'). the doses
of  xxxd123xxx  and cgp 20712a were chosen on the basis of
pilot experiments in conscious dogs, where they antagonized
the positive chronotropic effect of  xxxd2398xxx  (1.5 tlg kg-',
i.v.). the dose of ici 118551 was selected from a review of
the literature (bilski et al., 1983) and for its ability to
antagonize the fall in diastolic blood pressure induced by
salbutamol (30 tlg kg-', i.v.) in the anaesthetized dog (unpublished data). in those experiments in which sr 5861 1a was
combined with p-adrenoceptor antagonists, sr 5861 la
(100 ilg kg-') was injected as an i.v. bolus 15 min before the
meal (i.e. 30 min after starting the i.v. infusion of the
antagonist).
colonic spike activity was evaluated with the aid of a
computer system which has already proved reliable in several
studies (de ponti et al., 1988; 1994a). briefly, the number of
spikes per unit of time (o min or 1 h in the present
experiments) was calculated automatically by original software identifying spikes on the basis of a discriminant function. the hardware and software specifications of the system
have been detailed elsewhere (de ponti et al., 1988;
1994a).
according to sarna & lang (1989), the colonic motor
response to the meal was divided into three phases: the
immediate response (10 min period immediately following the
end of the meal), the early response (first 2 h after meal
ingestion) and the late response (which begins ~2 h after
meal ingestion). since the late response is believed to depend
on entry of chyme into the colon (sarna & lang, 1989;
flourie et al., 1989), it cannot be considered a true gastrocolonic response and therefore it will not be considered
further. from now on, the immediate and early response will
be referred to as the first and second phase of the gastrocolonic response, respectively.
mechanical tracings were analysed visually. according to
sarna & lang (1989) and flourie et al. (1989), a contractile
state was defined as a burst of contractions that lasted for at
least 1 min. contractile activity was then expressed as total
duration of contractions per hour.
in the dose-response study with sr 58611a, the effect of
the compound on the first phase of the gastrocolonic response was assessed by calculating the difference, for each
animal, between the number of spikes recorded in the 10 min
period following the end of the meal in the control
experiments (meal with i.v. injection of 154 mm nacl) and in
the experiments with sr 5861 ia. the value obtained was
then expressed as a percentage of the variation observed with
300 jig kg-', i.v., atropine. the effects of sr 5861 ia on heart
rate (difference between the peak post-treatment value and
the control value) were scored as a percentage of the variation observed after 300 tg kg- ', i.v., atropine. dose-response
relationships were evaluated by linear regression analysis according to tallarida & murray (1987). the best linear fitting
of the dose-response curves was obtained by the log transfor-

.

mation and the least-squares method. ed35 values (i.e. the
doses having an effect that was 35% of that of a supramaximal dose of atropine) with 95% confidence limits were
derived from log dose-response curves.

in vitro experiments
circular muscle strips (10-15 mm long) were obtained from
specimens of distal colon removed from male and female
beagle dogs (10-15 kg body weight) euthanized with  xxxd3354xxx  sodium (25 mg kg-', i.v.) followed by 0.3 ml kg- ' tanax
(hoechst, milan, italy). the preparations were deprived of
the mucosa by sharp dissection, connected to isotonic transducers (load: 1.5 g) and incubated in 20 ml organ baths
containing a modified krebs solution (composition, mm:
nacl 118, kci 4.7, cacl2 2.5,  xxxd2534xxx  1.2, kh2po4 1.2,
glucose 11.1, nahco3 25,  xxxd228xxx  0.11), continuously
bubbled with a mixture of 95% 02 and 5% co2 and main-

tained at a constant temperature of 37°c. after a tissueequilibration time of 60 min, we carried out cumulativeconcentration-response studies with p-adrenoceptor agonists
alone and after preincubation (30 min) with ,-adrenoceptor
antagonists or tetrodotoxin. all experiments were carried out
in the presence of 30 lm hydrocortisone (to block extraneuronal uptake of  xxxd2398xxx ) and 1 flm  xxxd2914xxx  (to
antagonize possible a-mediated effects of high concentrations
of  xxxd2398xxx : see smith et al., 1993).
in order to avoid desensitization, only one concentrationresponse curve to an agonist was carried out on each
preparation. concentration-response curves in the presence
and absence of antagonists were performed on preparations
obtained from the same animal.
the relaxations observed with p-adrenoceptor agonists
were expressed as percentages of the response to a supramaximal dose of  xxxd2398xxx . ec50 values (i.e. the concentrations
producing a half-maximal relaxation) with 95% confidence
limits were derived from log concentration-response curves.
the pa2 value for  xxxd123xxx , as defined by arunlakshana &
schild (1959), was obtained from a constrained plot (best
straight line with a slope of unity) according to tallarida &
murray (1987) after verifying that the experimental data
fitted a theoretical schild plot (slope not significantly
different from unity).

drugs were dissolved in 154 mm nacl for in vivo
experiments and in distilled water for in vitro experiments.

statistical analysis
statistical comparisons between two groups were made by
student's t test for paired data (two tailed). for multiple
comparisons, repeated measures analysis of variance followed
by the dunnett's test (for comparisons of values obtained
before and after a given treatment) or the student-newmankeuls test (for comparisons between different treatments and
controls) was used. a p value < 0.05 was considered
significant. values are given as mean ± s.e.mean.

results
in vivo experiments
colonic motor response to the standard meal and effect of
atropine in control experiments, colonic myoelectrical and
mechanical activities were stimulated by meal ingestion. the
mean numbers of spikes were 730 ± 69 (n = 5) in the 10 min
period immediately following the end of the meal (first phase
of the gastrocolonic response) and 298 ± 55 (n = 5) in the
10 min period preceding meal ingestion (p<0.01). the
numbers of spikes during the second phase of the gastrocolonic response were 3,455 ± 416 and 3,737 ± 431 (n = 5)
spikes h-' in the first and second hour, respectively as compared to 2315 ± 431 spikes h-' (n = 5) in the l h period
preceding meal ingestion (p<0.01). the increase in spike
activity was associated with an increase in mechanical
activity: the total durations per hour of contractile activity in
the first and second postprandial hour were 21 ± 3 and
22 ± 2 min (n = 5), respectively, as compared to 13 ± 2 min
(n= 5) in the 1 h period preceding meal ingestion
(p< 0.01).
the reference drug atropine (300 ilg kg-', i.v.) significantly
inhibited both the first and the second phase of the gastrocolonic response (figure 1).

 xxxd3130xxx  (both  xxxd1891xxx  g kg-' min-') or  xxxd2398xxx  (o.1 jig
kg-i min-') for 30 min induced significant tachycardia
(figure 2). the degree of tachycardia observed 15-30 min
after starting the intravenous infusion was similar for the
three p-adrenoceptor agonists. heart rate quickly returned to
control values after  xxxd2398xxx , while it remained
significantly higher than control levels for at least 40-60 min
after stopping the sr 5861 1a or  xxxd3130xxx  infusion.i
sr 58611a (10 ,g kg- l min' l),  xxxd3130xxx  (10 jg kg- minl)
and  xxxd2398xxx  (0.1 g kg-' min-') inhibited the first phase
of the gastrocolonic response with this dose of  xxxd2398xxx 
being significantly (p<0.05) less effective than sr 58611a
or  xxxd3130xxx  (figure 3).
sr 58611a and  xxxd3130xxx  significantly reduced spike
activity also in the second phase of the gastrocolonic response, while the small decrease in motility observed with
 xxxd2398xxx  did not reach statistical significance (figure 4).

discussion
the present study has provided strong functional evidence
that atypical or p3-adrenoceptors can modulate canine colonic motility both in vivo and in vitro. furthermore, the in
vivo experiments have shown that p-adrenoceptor agonists, at
doses producing the same degree of tachycardia, inhibit the
gastrocolonic response to a different extent. sr 58611a and
 xxxd3130xxx  virtually abolished the first phase of the gastrocolonic response, while  xxxd2398xxx , administered at a dose
that has been shown to induce maximal tachycardia in the
dog (tavernier et al., 1992), was significantly less
effective.
a few pharmacokinetic considerations need to be taken
into account when comparing drug effects in vivo, since
differences may simply be due to different pharmacokinetics
of the compounds to be tested. in this respect, it should be
noted that the first phase of the gastrocolonic response was
assessed by calculating the number of spikes in the 10 mn
period after the end of the meal, i.e. in a time period between
15 and 30 min after starting p-adrenoceptor agonist infusion,
when the chronotropic effect was at its plateau for all the
three agonists tested (the meal was administered 15 min after

the second phase of the gastrocolonic response was similar to
that observed in the first phase of the response, except in the
case of  xxxd2398xxx , which caused only a minor, nonsignificant inhibition. however, since the second phase of the
response involved evaluation of spike activity after the end of
drug infusion, this lack of effect was probably due to the very
short half-life of  xxxd2398xxx  (conolly et al., 1972), as
indicated by the sudden drop in heart rate after the end of
the  xxxd2398xxx  infusion.
in the dose-response study with sr 5861 la, we found that
its ed35 value for induction of tachycardia was 6.7 time as
high as its ed35 value for inhibition of colonic motility. this
indicates that sr 5861 la, after i.v. bolus administration
(which should favour drug delivery to the cardiovascular
system), still maintains preferential activity on the colon, as
already described in the rat for other phenylethanolaminotetralines (giudice et al., 1989). this finding has important
implications in the search for new therapeutic agents
inhibiting intestinal motility, since currently available padrenoceptor agonists cannot be used for the treatment of
intestinal motility disorders because of their significant cardiovascular effects (lyrenas et al., 1985).
although extrapolation to man of data generated in
animal experiments is not without caveats, our model certainly appears a useful tool for the preclinical screening of
compounds of potential application in the treatment of intestinal motor disorders such as the irritable bowel syndrome, a
condition in which the gastrocolonic response is exaggerated
and is associated with occurrence of symptoms (mckee &
quigley, 1993). indeed, the gastrocolonic response in dogs is
well reproducible and similar to that observed in man (sarna
& lang, 1989; mckee & quigley, 1993). furthermore, our
experimental model allows us to compare the colonic vs
cardiovascular effects of p-adrenoceptor agonists in vivo, i.e.
in a condition where the responses may be affected by several
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variables, which can
modify the selectivity profile observed in vitro. our in vivo
study has substantially confirmed the selectivity profile of sr
5861 ia reported in vitro by bianchetti & manara (1990).
concerning the positive chronotropic response observed after
i.v. injection of p3-adrenoceptor agonists, the mechanism
underlying this effect seems to involve a baroreceptormediated reflex secondary to hypotension (tavernier et al.,
1992), as no evidence for the presence of p3-adrenoceptors in
dog heart has been obtained so far (tavernier et al., 1992;
takayama et al., 1993).
since p-adrenoceptor agonists have significant cardiovas-

colonic motility and a3.adrenoceptom

cular effects, the question arises as to whether inhibition of
colonic motility observed in vivo is secondary to variations in
blood flow. a previous study by esser et al. (1987) showed
that p-adrenoceptor agonists inhibited colonic motility while
increasing blood flow to the inferior mesenteric artery with
no correlation between the two parameters. moreover, sr
58611a was shown to inhibit colonic motility at doses with
minor or no effect on heart rate or blood pressure. thus, we
believe that the inhibition of the gastrocolonic response by
p-adrenoceptor agonists, namely sr 5861 1a, was due mainly
to a direct effect on colonic smooth muscle, as confirmed by
our in vitro experiments, where a concentration-dependent,
tetrodotoxin-resistant relaxation was observed with sr
5861 1a. the existence of p-adrenoceptors on intestinal
smooth muscle cells is indeed well documented (bulbring &
tomita, 1987; smith et al., 1993).
concerning the subtype of p-adrenoceptor involved in the
inhibition of colonic motility, our experiments have provided
evidence in favour of the hypothesis that p3-adrenoceptors
mediate the effect of sr 5861 ia both in vivo and in vitro,
since the effect of the compound was resistant to pi and
p2-selective adrenoceptor antagonists and antagonized competitively in vitro by  xxxd123xxx  with a pa2 value of 7.1, which
is similar to that reported in the guinea-pig ileum, rat ileum
and rat colon (bianchetti & manara, 1990; blue et al., 1990;
growcott et al., 1993a,b; landi et al., 1993). however, our
experiments suggest that other p-adrenoceptor subtypes may
contribute to the modulation of canine colonic motility, as
indicated by the ability of cgp 20712a and ici 118551 to
antagonize, at least in part,  xxxd2398xxx -induced relaxations.
inhibition of  xxxd3130xxx -induced responses by ici 118551 is
also in favour of an involvement of p2-adrenoceptors, in line
with a binding study carried out in smooth muscle preparations obtained from the canine colon (smith et al., 1993).
in conclusion, the present study has shown that sr
58611a, most likely by an action\on p3-adrenoceptors,
inhibits canine colonic motility both in vivo and in vitro.
however, our results should not be interpreted as showing a
physiological role of p3-adrenoceptors in mediating the
gastrocolonic response: they simply provide evidence in
favour of the existence of these receptors in the canine colon
and that p3-adrenoceptors can modulate a physiological response.
