the l-type calcium channels possess binding sites for at
least three distinct organic drug types: dihydropyridines
(dhp), phenylalkylamines (paa), and benzothiazepines
(btz). these binding sites are known to reside on the ␣1
subunit of the channel (for review, see hockerman et al.,
1997a; zahradnı́ková and lacinová, 1998; striessnig et al.,
1998). in the transmembrane segments iiis6 and ivs6 of the
␣1 subunit, several of the amino acids essential for the highaffinity binding of either drug type are shared by two or by all
three binding sites (hering et al., 1996; schuster et al., 1996;
hockerman et al., 1997b; kraus et al., 1998; striessnig et al.,

tion between the dihydropyridine agonist bay k8644 and the
antagonist  xxxd2092xxx  was found purely competitive. the interaction between bay k8644 and verapamil or diltiazem was
found noncompetitive, and it could be described only by
inclusion of a negative interaction factor ␯ ⫽ ⫺0.60 for
verapamil and a positive interaction factor ␯ ⫽ ⫹0.24 for
diltiazem. these results suggest that at physiological membrane potentials, the l-type calcium channel cannot be simultaneously occupied by a dihydropyridine agonist and
antagonist, whereas it can simultaneously bind a dihydropyridine agonist and a nondihydropyridine antagonist. generally, the effects of the drugs on the l-type calcium channel
support a concept of a channel domain responsible for binding of calcium channel antagonists and agonists changing
dynamically with the membrane voltage and occupancy of
individual binding sites.

1998). this suggests that all three binding sites reside in
close proximity.
the inhibition of calcium current by dhp, paa, and btz
calcium antagonists in all l-type calcium channel isoforms is
dependent on channel state (for review, see mcdonald et al.,
1994). channel affinity for all calcium antagonists increases
with depolarization. dhp, paa, and btz drugs differ by
their use dependence, with dhps being the least use-dependent, btzs being intermediate, and paas being the most
use-dependent. for the interaction of paa and btz drugs
with their binding sites, amino acids on the ␣1 subunit of the
channel that play a role in channel inactivation are also
important (hering et al., 1997; kraus et al., 1998; motoike et
al., 1999). therefore, it was suggested that inactivation and
use-dependent block share common molecular determinants
(hering et al., 1998).
recent findings in chimeric channels (berjukow et al.,
1999) suggest important differences between btz drug binding to the skeletal and cardiac calcium channel isoforms.

abstract
phenylalkylamines, benzothiazepines, and dihydropyridines
bind noncompetitively to the l-type calcium channel. the
molecular mechanisms of this interaction were investigated
in enzymatically isolated rat ventricular myocytes using the
whole-cell patch-clamp technique. when applied alone,  xxxd2092xxx , verapamil, and diltiazem inhibited the l-type calcium
current with values of inhibitory constant (kb) of 11, 246, and
512 nm, respectively, whereas 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-5nitro-4-(2-[trifluoromethyl]phenyl)- xxxd2715xxx 
methyl ester (bay k8644) activated ica with activation constant
(ka) of 33 nm. maximal activation of ica by 300 nm bay k8644
strongly reduced the inhibitory potency of  xxxd2092xxx  (apparent kb
of 165 nm), significantly reduced the inhibitory potency of verapamil (apparent kb of 737 nm), but significantly increased the
inhibitory potency of diltiazem (apparent kb of 310 nm). in terms of

isolation of myocytes. ventricular myocytes were isolated from
male wistar rats (200 –250 g) using the procedure described by
zahradnı́k and palade (1993). approximately 30 min after administration of heparin (5000 u/kg i.p.), rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium. the hearts
were rapidly dissected and retrogradely perfused with oxygenated
solutions at 37°c. the perfusion started with tyrode’s solution (135
mm nacl, 5.4 mm kcl, 5 mm mgcl2, 10 mm hepes, 0.33 mm
nah2po4, and 1 mm cacl2, ph 7.3) applied for 5 min. it continued
with a nominally ca2⫹-free tyrode’s solution (free ca2⫹ of 5 ␮m) for
5 min, and it completed with the enzyme solution (collagenasa
cruda; úsol, prague, czech republic; 180 ␮g/ml dissolved in tyrode’s solution with free ca2⫹ set to 20 ␮m). after 5 min of enzymatic
perfusion, the left ventricle and septum were dissected, and the
tissue was further incubated up to 5 min in the enzyme solution. the
tissue was then minced, placed into 4 ml of the stopping solution (106
mm ch3so3k, 1 mm egta, 22 mm taurine, 22 mm glucose, 2.4 mm
 xxxd2534xxx , and 8 mm k2hpo4, ph 7.3), gently stirred, and triturated.
the cell suspension was filtered through a nylon mesh and centrifuged at 25g for 5 min. the cells were washed twice by 4 ml of the
stopping solution, and they were stored in petri dishes at room
temperature for use within 1 to 4 h after isolation.
calcium current measurements. the l-type calcium current
(ica) was recorded using the standard whole-cell patch-clamp technique (hamill et al., 1981). the patch-clamped myocyte was placed

into the perfusion channel (volume 50 ␮l) allowing rapid (⬍1 s) and
complete exchange of external solutions. the sodium channel current was inhibited using a ⫺50-mv holding potential and 20 ␮m ttx
in the external solution, and potassium currents were blocked by
replacement of k⫹ ions with cs⫹ in both the external and internal
solution. calcium channels were kept in maximally phosphorylated
state by including 50 ␮m camp to the internal solution and 10 ␮m
 xxxd2388xxx  (a membrane-permeable phosphodiesterase inhibitor) to the
external solution. the standard protocol for recording calcium currents consisted of a train of 70-ms voltage pulses to 0 mv, elicited
every 3 s from a holding potential of ⫺50 mv. all experiments were
carried out at room temperature (22–24°c).
solutions for patch-clamp recordings. the external solution
contained 135 mm nacl, 5.4 mm cscl, 10 mm hepes, 5 mm mgcl2,
0.33 mm nah2po4, 1 mm cacl2, 0.02 mm ttx, and 0.01 mm  xxxd2388xxx ,
ph adjusted to 7.3 with naoh. the internal solution contained 135
mm csch3so3, 10 mm cscl, 10 mm hepes, 1 mm egta, 3 mm
 xxxd2534xxx , 3 mm atp, and 0.05 mm camp, ph adjusted to 7.3 with
csoh.
drugs.  xxxd2388xxx  was from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo). ttx was
from sigma-aldrich or alomone labs (jerusalem, israel). the calcium channel drugs were from the following sources: (⫾)-bay k8644
(calbiochem, lucerne, switzerland), d-cis-diltiazem (lachema,
brno, czech republic), and (⫾)-verapamil (sigma-aldrich).  xxxd2092xxx  was kindly provided by astra hässle (mölndal, sweden). all
other chemicals were of analytical grade. all solutions were made
using double-distilled water. solutions of dihydropyridines were prepared by dilution of 50 mm (bay k8644) and 10 mm ( xxxd2092xxx )
stock solutions of the drugs in ethanol in the extracellular solution at
the beginning of each experiment (the final ethanol concentration,
⬍0.01%, was without effect on calcium currents).
data acquisition and analysis. whole-cell currents were measured with the epc-7 amplifier (list electronics, darmstadt, germany), filtered at 2 khz, and digitized at 5 khz by the labmaster
interface (scientific solutions, mentor, oh) using commercial software (pclamp version 5.5.1; molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca).
series resistance of approximately 2.5 m⍀ was compensated electronically by approximately 70% of its value. the capacitance charging current was canceled in part electronically and in part with an
on-line subtraction procedure.
the results are expressed as mean ⫾ s.e. the values of fitted
parameters are given with the mean ⫾ s.e. of the fit. statistical
significance was estimated using the student’s t test. the significance of differences between the quality of fit by individual models
was tested using the f-test. a difference was considered significant
if p ⬍ 0.05.
quantitative description of dose-response data. the relationships between concentration of drugs and the peak calcium current was described using dose-response equations derived from the
law of mass action. it has to be noted, however, that the dissociation
constants of the drugs are voltage-dependent; thus, the equations
describe the steady state rather than equilibrium. therefore, we use
the term “pseudoequilibrium models”. the models that involve simultaneous binding of bay k8644 and the calcium antagonist were
defined as “noncompetitive”, because they do not distinguish
whether the ligands induce conformational changes of the channel,
i.e., modulate each other’s binding sites allosterically, or whether
they hinder each other’s binding/unbinding sterically. the inhibition
of calcium current by calcium antagonists was described by the
following dose-response equation:

et al., 1997) and verapamil (porzig and becker, 1988) on binding of dihydropyridine antagonists in living cardiac myocytes
differed from those in skeletal muscle. noncompetitive interactions between the binding sites for dhp, btz, and paa drugs
were observed in binding studies with calcium channel antagonists on purified skeletal muscle membrane preparations
(glossmann et al., 1985; striessnig et al., 1986). they have been
interpreted as a result of a positive allosteric effect of btz drugs
and a negative allosteric effect of the paa drugs on the dhp
binding site. in cardiac myocytes, both btz and paa drugs
displayed a positive allosteric effect on the dhp binding in
polarized cells, whereas both drug types had a negative allosteric effect in depolarized cells. in addition, the effects of the dhp
antagonist  xxxd2737xxx  and the btz antagonist diltiazem on
calcium currents through expressed  xxxg304xxx  channels were
shown to be additive at room temperature but synergic at elevated temperature (kanda et al., 1998). these results suggest
that in cardiac cells, not only binding of a single drug but also
the character of mutual interactions between different drugs
and the calcium channel depends on experimental conditions
defining the state of the channel. there is only one study of the
interaction between the dhp and paa or btz drugs using
direct recording of the calcium currents, that is, on functional
calcium channels (kanda et al., 1998). yet, such studies can
provide a deeper insight into the mechanism of drug action
under physiological conditions, under which membrane potential periodically changes.
in the present work, we studied the inhibitory effects of
different types of calcium antagonists in the presence of the
dihydropyridine agonist bay k8644. with the help of mathematical modeling, we characterized their mutual binding
interactions. we conclude that the diversity of mutual dhp,
paa, and btz binding interactions conforms to an idea of a
dynamic drug-binding domain within the calcium channel,
which changes as a function of the channel state and occupancy of individual binding sites.

modulation of inhibitory effects of calcium channel
antagonists by bay k8644. figure 1 demonstrates the
approach used in determining the effect of bay k8644 on the
inhibitory effect of calcium channel antagonists. progressively increasing concentrations of the antagonists were applied to the patch-clamped myocytes that were periodically
stimulated by 70-ms pulses from a holding potential of ⫺50
to 0 mv every 3 s. individual current responses were recorded (fig. 1a, top). the peak amplitudes of the calcium
current, ica,p, were plotted as a function of time (fig. 1a,
bottom). steady-state values of ica,p at a given concentration
of the drug were taken for construction of the dose-response
curves. after applying the highest concentration of the drug,
the cell was hyperpolarized to ⫺80 mv for 60 s and then
stimulation was resumed. the amplitude of the first current

mv (middle line) in the presence of the drug. full symbols (a–f) correspond to current traces shown in the top panel. b, typical experiment

analogous to that for a. during the indicated periods, the myocyte was
exposed to bay k8644 (top line), increasing concentrations of  xxxd2092xxx 
(bottom lines), and subjected to a 60-s hyperpolarization to ⫺80 mv
(middle line) in the presence of the drugs.

response after resuming stimulation was used to estimate
the effect of the antagonist at ⫺80 mv. analogous experiments on different cells were performed in the presence of
300 nm bay k8644, which led to maximal stimulation of the
calcium current (fig. 1b). the presented data below show
that the apparent affinity of the individual antagonists was
changed significantly by the presence of the bay k8644, yet
differently for each of them.
the effect of the dhp  xxxd2092xxx  on calcium currents in the
absence and the presence of bay k8644 is illustrated in fig.
1, a and b. the inhibitory efficiency of  xxxd2092xxx  was
strongly depressed by bay k8644. the concentration of  xxxd2092xxx  necessary for inhibition of ica,p to 50% of the control
was increased by an order of magnitude (table 1). a 60-s
sojourn at ⫺80 mv led to almost complete reversal of  xxxd2092xxx  inhibition (table 2). however, the activating effect by
bay k8644 persisted at this membrane potential. still notably, inhibition of ica by  xxxd2092xxx  was substantially slowed
down in the presence of bay k8644 (table 3).
similar but less pronounced effects of bay k8644 were
observed in experiments with verapamil (fig. 2, a and b).
the design of the experiments was the same as with  xxxd2092xxx . again, the inhibitory efficiency of verapamil and the rate
of ica,p inhibition by verapamil were significantly reduced
(tables 1 and 3). however, recovery of the peak ica amplitude
after 1-min hyperpolarization was less prominent for verapamil than for  xxxd2092xxx  (table 2).

azem (fig. 3, a and b), compared with the effects of  xxxd2092xxx 
and verapamil. inhibition of ica by diltiazem was enhanced
by the presence of bay k8644 (table 1). at the same time,
bay k8644 displayed no significant effect on the rate of ica,p
inhibition by diltiazem. hyperpolarization fully removed inhibition of ica by diltiazem.
the dose-response data are shown in figs. 4 to 6 for  xxxd2092xxx , verapamil, and diltiazem, respectively. in all cases,
the effect of the drugs was fully saturable at adequate doses,
as already reported by others (bean, 1984; uehara and

dose dependencies with the appropriate dose-response equations (see materials and methods) provided the apparent

judged by the ␹2 value (f-test; p ⬍ 0.0001) and standard
errors of the fitted parameters. the systematic error introduced by the competitive model was apparent especially at
low concentrations of verapamil and bay k8644. the values
of ka, kb, and ␣ obtained by the cooperative model (table 4)
were not significantly different from those obtained by fitting
of the dose-response curves for verapamil and bay k8644
applied alone (table 1) whereas analogous parameters of the
competitive model differed substantially.
the data for diltiazem are plotted in fig. 6. the doseresponse data could not be reasonably approximated by the
competitive model, but they were well fitted by the cooperative model with a positive value of the interaction factor ␯.
the competitive model deviated from the data at all concentrations of diltiazem as well as of bay k8644; therefore, it
could not be accepted (f-test; p ⬍ 0.0001). the values of ka,

in this work, we show that the binding of calcium channel
antagonists of the dhp, paa, and btz type to the cardiac
l-type calcium channel in situ is modulated by the presence
of the dihydropyridine agonist bay k8644, and we explain
this interaction using mechanistic pseudoequilibrium model
of competitive and noncompetitive interactions.
competition between an activating and an inhibiting dihydropyridine has not been previously demonstrated. in binding studies, it is not possible to control the gating state of the
channel, and the dhp agonists are known to inhibit calcium
channel activity at depolarized potentials (sanguinetti et al.,
1986; hadley and hume, 1988; kamp et al., 1989). in the
presented electrophysiological experiments, bay k8644 induced a very pronounced decrease in the apparent affinity of
the dihydropyridine antagonist  xxxd2092xxx . a model assuming
that bay k8644 and  xxxd2092xxx  cannot simultaneously bind to
the calcium channel, that is, a pure competitive mechanism,
could quantitatively account for this decrease. however, our
results do not strictly imply that both bay k8644 and the
inhibitory dihydropyridines bind to identical binding site.
the “competitive” shape of the concentration dependence
implies only that both drugs cannot bind to their binding
sites simultaneously, with no implication about the exact
place of binding. therefore, it is possible that different conformations of the channel expose different binding sites, one
that has a high affinity to inhibitory and the other to activatory dihydropyridines, such as predicted by homology modeling (zhorov et al., 2001). in this context, it has been noted
that the agonist/antagonist action of dihydropyridines might
be determined by their orientation with respect to the  xxxg2074xxx /
siv interface of the calcium channel (yamaguchi et al.,
2003). different voltage dependence of the action of dihydropyridine antagonists and agonists is well known (kamp et
al., 1989; wei et al., 1989). in the presented experiments, this
difference was demonstrated as the reversal of  xxxd2092xxx 
inhibition but persistent bay k8644 activation of the channel
at ⫺80 mv (fig. 2). results of others, such as dual agonist
and antagonist action of certain dihydropyridines measured
in single-channel experiments (hess et al., 1984; kokubun
and reuter, 1984; brown et al., 1986), and the presence of
amino acids differently regulating the binding of agonist and

antagonist dihydropyridines (mitterdorfer et al., 1996;
schuster et al., 1996; ito et al., 1997) further favor this
mechanism.
although a lot is known about the mutual interactions
between the dihydropyridine binding site on one hand and
phenylalkylamine or benzothiazepine binding site on the
other hand, these studies have been traditionally performed
in biochemically isolated (and often purified) sarcolemmal
membrane preparation from skeletal muscle (glossmann et
al., 1985; striessnig et al., 1986). in these experiments, diltiazem enhanced and verapamil decreased the affinity of the
channel to bind dihydropyridines by noncompetitive mecha-

nisms, which were regarded allosteric. in the comparative
study on equilibrium binding of  xxxd2092xxx  (minarovic and
meszaros, 1998), the interactions between the binding sites
for dhp, btz, and paa drugs were qualitatively similar in
both, skeletal and cardiac membranes. brauns et al. (1997)
observed in solubilized skeletal muscle preparation that dihydropyridines decrease the association rate for btz antagonists, but they do not affect equilibrium binding. on the
basis of these observations, it was suggested that the interaction between the two drug sites on the calcium channel has
a large steric component.
the data on polarized membrane vesicles or cardiac myocytes with a defined membrane potential are scarce. both

verapamil (porzig and becker, 1988) and diltiazem (porzig
and becker, 1988; kanda et al., 1997) enhanced the affinity of
dihydropyridines to l-type calcium channels in polarized
cells, whereas they had inhibitory effect on dihydropyridine
binding in depolarized cells (porzig and becker, 1988). the
main difference between verapamil and diltiazem was in the
magnitude of the effects: although in polarized cells the
effect of diltiazem was more pronounced than that of verapamil, it was the opposite in depolarized cells; here, the effect
of verapamil prevailed.
the results of the present study, obtained in the physiological range of membrane potentials using repetitive stimulation, revealed important differences between the action of
verapamil and diltiazem. these differences could be conveniently quantified by a single interaction factor, which attained a negative value in the case of the paa verapamil and
a positive value in the case of the btz diltiazem (table 4).
from a kinetic point of view, the differences between the
paa and btz type of antagonists were also prominent. although the effective on-rate of verapamil binding decreased
when the channel was occupied by bay k8644, no significant
change in the on-rate of inhibition by diltiazem in the presence of the dihydropyridine agonist was observed. as the
apparent affinity of diltiazem is increased due to its positive
cooperativity with bay k8644, it can be inferred that the
effective rate of dissociation of diltiazem from the channel is
decreased when the channel is occupied by bay k8644.
in our study, the cells were held at a membrane potential

of ⫺50 mv for 3 s, and then they were depolarized to 0 mv for
70 ms. the stimulation protocol was repetitive, so that a
steady state between the population of drug-free and differently drug-bound channels was established shortly. the dissociation constants of the drugs determined in the present
work therefore are apparent constants, in which affinities of
different channel states to the drugs are weighted according
to their probability distribution, as was observed before by
several laboratories (bean, 1984; méry et al., 1996).
to give molecular interpretation to our findings, we extended the guarded modulated receptor model of the l-type
calcium channel (hering et al., 1998; berjukow et al., 1999)
to incorporate the simultaneous action of an agonist and a
non-dhp antagonist. these authors have shown the importance of both the preferential drug binding to inactivated
channels and the slow rate of drug unbinding from noninactivated channels in the phenomenon of use dependence. in
the depolarized state, drugs have high affinity to the channel,
because of the high rate of drug binding in the open state and
of drug trapping in the inactivated state. unbinding of the
drug occurs mainly upon recovery from inactivation. we propose that in polarized cells, occupation of the dhp site hinders unbinding of the paa/btz drugs from the calcium channel, and vice versa, thereby effectively increasing drug
affinity and accounting for the positive interaction coefficient. thus, the rate constants from the ternary complexes
are decreased in the closed states of the channel. in depolarized cells, when the channels reside in the open state(s), the
interaction of dhp and of the btz or paa drugs with their
respective binding sites is sterically hindered. as a result, the
association rate constants of the ternary complex channeldhp drug-non-dhp drug are lower than the rate constants
of binary drug-channel complexes in the open state(s) of the
channel, effectively decreasing drug affinity and accounting
for a negative interaction coefficient. in contrast, no ternary
complex can be formed in the presence of an agonist and
antagonist dihydropyridine.
this model explains why dhp and btz/paa decrease each
other’s affinity in depolarized cells, whereas they increase
each other’s affinity in polarized cells (at ⫺50 mv) as observed by porzig and becker (1988). the difference in the
action of verapamil and diltiazem in the presence of bay
k8644 can be then attributed to their different use dependence (lee and tsien, 1983; uehara and hume, 1985; for
review, see mcdonald et al., 1994), i.e., to the different
weight of the rate constants of drug binding to the open
channel and drug unbinding from the recovering channel. it
is conceivable that steady-state inhibition by diltiazem (the
less use-dependent compound) is more dependent on the
interaction of the drug with the closed and recovering channel. in the presence of verapamil (the more use-dependent
compound), the steady-state inhibition is more dependent on
the rate constants of drug binding to the open channel.
the interaction between dhp and btz/paa takes place
within the small space to which their binding sites are confined at the ␣1 subunit of the channel (lipkind and fozzard,
2003; yamaguchi et al., 2003). therefore, the interaction
between the drugs and bay k8644 probably has a strong
steric component, as suggested for verapamil by kraus et al.
(1998). the enhancement of diltiazem action by bay k8644 at
the expense of decreased off-rates of drugs in the ternary
complex might be also interpreted by a steric model, such as

agonist-antagonist interactions at calcium channel receptors

that used for describing the interaction between alcuronium
and n-methyl scopolamine at the cardiac muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (proska and tucek, 1994). our findings
suggest that the domain responsible for binding of calcium
channel antagonists and agonists within the ␣1 subunit of
the l-type calcium channel dynamically changes as a function of channel state and occupancy by these drugs, thus
giving importance to its structural changes during gating.
