background and objectives: studies suggest an association between elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ap) and increased mortality in hemodialysis patients, but the effect of existing therapies on ap is not fully understood. we assessed the
effects of  xxxd1701xxx  on ap in a secondary analysis of controlled trial data.
design, setting, participants, & measurements: this was a post hoc analysis of data from three 26-wk randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials and a 26-wk double-blind, placebo-controlled extension trial that investigated
 xxxd1701xxx  in secondary hyperparathyroidism treatment in dialysis patients. hemodialysis patients (n ⴝ 890) with intact
 xxxg1885xxx  >300 pg/ml and serum calcium >8.4 mg/dl received  xxxd1701xxx  plus standard therapy or standard therapy
alone for up to 52 wk. total, not bone-specific, ap was assessed (proportion of  xxxd1701xxx /control subjects achieving a >20%
or any ap reduction from baseline; the proportion of subjects with ap >120 u/l) at baseline; the end of titration; and study
weeks 26, 42, and 52.
results: at 52 wk, a greater proportion of  xxxd1701xxx -treated patients had either a >20% (39 versus 18%) or any (58 versus 36%)
ap reduction compared with control subjects, respectively. the likelihood of achieving either a >20% or any ap reduction
(determined by relative proportion) was 2.33 (95% confidence interval 1.50 to 3.61) and 1.74 (95% confidence interval 1.31 to
2.31), respectively, at week 52.  xxxd1701xxx  treatment tended toward a decreased percentage of patients with ap >120 u/l
(baseline, 42.6%; week 52, 30.6%) compared with control (35.0 to 48.6%, respectively).
conclusions: in this combined analysis of controlled trials of patients who were receiving hemodialysis,  xxxd1701xxx  lowered
total serum ap.

iochemical and pathologic abnormalities are a common
component of chronic kidney disease–mineral bone
disorder (ckd-mbd) and often include a combination
of elevated  xxxg1885xxx  (pth), parathyroid hyperplasia, and manifestations of disordered calcium and phosphorus
homeostasis (1,2). among the most serious ckd-mbd morbidities are vascular and soft-tissue calcification (3–5) and renal
osteodystrophy (6), which often result in increases in markers
of bone metabolism, including serum alkaline phosphatase
(ap) (7).
the association between disordered serum pth, calcium,
phosphorus, and calcium-phosphorus product (ca ⫻ p) and an
increased risk for mortality in hemodialysis patients has been
described by large observational trials (8 –10). more recent observational data have demonstrated a positive monotonic relationship between serum ap levels and mortality (10 –12).

in a post hoc analysis, treatment was associated with improved
clinical outcomes, including improved quality of life and reduced risk for parathyroidectomy, cardiovascular hospitalization, and fracture (16). furthermore, in a recent small, singlearm study, treatment with  xxxd1701xxx  was associated with
progressive improvement in markers of bone metabolism, including bone ap (17). the aim of these analyses was to assess
the effects of  xxxd1701xxx  on ap in combined studies that investigated the safety and efficacy of  xxxd1701xxx  in patients who
were receiving dialysis.

materials and methods
patients
this study was a post hoc analysis of combined data from three 26-wk
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase 3 trials (13,14) and a 26-wk double-blind, placebo-controlled extension trial
(15), conducted in the united states, europe, and australia. these
studies investigated the efficacy and safety of  xxxd1701xxx  in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (shpt) in patients who were
receiving dialysis. the three parent trials enrolled 1136 patients, respectively, with 266 patients from the former two of the three parent studies
continuing treatment in the 26-wk extension study. the studies were
conducted in accordance with the principles of the declaration of
helsinki, study procedures were approved by the appropriate institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each site, and
all patients provided written informed consent.

study design
key inclusion and exclusion criteria and study procedures have been
reported in detail previously (13–15). in brief, patients who were receiving dialysis for a minimum of 1 to 3 mo (depending on the trial) and
had pth ⱖ300 pg/ml and serum calcium ⱖ8.4 mg/dl (to convert
serum calcium in mg/dl to mmol/l, multiply by 0.2495) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 or 3:1  xxxd1701xxx :placebo ratio (depending on
the trial design) to receive either  xxxd1701xxx  or a matched placebo in
combination with standard (control) therapy. study blind was maintained through the use of an interactive voice response system and
numbered study bottles. the trials consisted of a 12- to 16-wk titration
phase followed by a 10- to 14-wk efficacy assessment phase. in the
extension study, patients from two of the parent trials could continue to
receive treatment in a blinded manner for an additional 6 mo.  xxxd1701xxx  was initiated at 30 mg/d and increased sequentially (60, 90, 120, and
180 mg/d) when serum intact pth (ipth) was ⬎200 pg/ml unless
serum calcium was ⬍7.8 mg/dl, symptoms of hypocalcemia occurred,
or an adverse event that precluded a dosage increase occurred. in
general, the dosage of vitamin d sterols could be increased if ipth
increased by ⬎50% from baseline, if serum calcium was ⬍8.4 mg/dl, or
if symptoms of hypocalcemia developed. the dosage of vitamin d
sterols could be decreased if ipth was ⬍100 pg/ml, serum calcium was
ⱖ11.0 mg/dl, serum phosphorus was ⱖ6.5 mg/dl (to convert serum
phosphorus in mg/dl to mmol/l, multiply by 0.3229), or ca ⫻ p was
ⱖ70 mg2/dl2 (to convert ca ⫻ p in mg2/dl2 to mmol/l, multiply by
0.0806). no restrictions were placed on the dosage or type of phosphate
binder used. serum ap was evaluated at baseline, at the end of the
titration phase (week 12 or 16), and week 26 of the parent trials and at
weeks 42 and 52 in the extension trial.

outcomes
this study examined four related biochemical outcomes in both
treatment groups. the first was the proportion of patients who
achieved a reduction in serum ap from baseline by any amount or by
at least 20% at weeks 12/16, 26, 42, and 52. the second examined the
likelihood (determined using relative proportion) of exhibiting a reduction by any amount or by at least 20% in serum ap. the third examined
the proportion of patients with serum ap ⱖ120 u/l. the fourth
assessed whether a correlation exists between serum ipth and ap
levels at weeks 12/16, 26, 42, and 52.

concomitant medications
vitamin d sterol and phosphate binder use across assessment points
was determined by calculating the proportion of patients who used
vitamin d sterols or phosphate binders during each week of ap assessment. for patients with a nonzero dosage, vitamin d sterol dosages
were expressed as weekly  xxxd2851xxx  equivalent dosages (␮g/wk).
calcitriol dosages were converted to  xxxd2851xxx  equivalents by multiplying by a factor of 4. phosphate binder dosages were expressed as a
sum of all phosphate binders expressed as grams per meal.

statistical analysis
we included data from hemodialysis patients who completed the
dosage-titration phase of the studies and who had assessable serum ap
measurements at baseline and at the end of the titration phase. we used
a log-binomial regression model to estimate, for each week’s measurement, the relative proportion of having serum ap reduced by at least
20% and by any amount in the two treatment groups, controlling for
age, gender, race, body mass index, time on dialysis (vintage), baseline
ap, history of diabetes, and history of cardiovascular disease (including cerebrovascular accident, peripheral vascular disease, myocardial

clin j am soc nephrol 4: 673– 679, 2009

infarction, coronary artery disease, or congestive heart failure) and
stroke. to ensure consistency of the results in cases in which the
log-binomial model did not converge, we used a model with a reduced
number of the covariates. correlation between serum ipth and ap at
each time point was assessed by spearman and pearson correlation
analyses. all statistical analyses were conduced using sas 9.1.3 software (sas institute, cary, nc).

results
study patients
of the 1136 patients enrolled in the parent trials, 890 met the
criteria for inclusion in this analysis. overall, the demographic
and clinical characteristics of the  xxxd1701xxx  and control groups
were similar. the median ap level seemed to be slightly higher
in the  xxxd1701xxx  compared with the control group, although the
interquartile range (iqr) was similar (table 1); however, median baseline pth in the  xxxd1701xxx  group was somewhat
higher than in the control group (601 versus 548 pg/ml), and
there was a greater proportion of black patients in the  xxxd1701xxx 
group (52 versus 42%). mean age was slightly greater in the
control than in the  xxxd1701xxx  group (55 versus 52 yr). the
median  xxxd1701xxx  dosage during the titration phase was 60
mg/d.

effect of  xxxd1701xxx  on serum ap
serum ap levels tended to increase during the course of the
study in the control group, whereas they tended to decrease in
the  xxxd1701xxx  group (figure 1a). median serum ap in the
control group increased from 99 u/l (iqr 77 to 143) at baseline
to 113 u/l (iqr 86 to 189) at week 52. in the  xxxd1701xxx  group,
the median value decreased from 111 u/l (iqr 81 to 153) at
baseline to 95 u/l (iqr 74 to 129) at week 52.
serum ap was reduced by ⱖ20% from baseline in a greater
proportion of patients in the  xxxd1701xxx  group than in the control group at all time points (table 2). the increased adjusted
likelihood (determined by relative proportion [rp]) of achieving a ⱖ20% reduction from baseline in serum ap with  xxxd1701xxx  was between 1.73 and 2.61 times more likely compared with
control subjects across the study time points (week 12/16 rp
1.92 [95% confidence interval (ci) 1.35 to 2.75]; week 26 rp 1.73
[95% ci 1.32 to 2.26]; week 42 rp 2.61 [95% ci 1.64 to 4.14]; and
week 52 rp 2.33 [95% ci 1.50 to 3.61]). similarly, a greater
proportion of  xxxd1701xxx -treated patients achieved any reduction in serum ap from baseline at all time points. the adjusted
likelihood of exhibiting any reduction in serum ap among
 xxxd1701xxx -treated patients was between 1.09- and 1.44-fold
greater when compared with control subjects (week 12/16 rp
1.09 [95% ci 0.94 to 1.27]; week 26 rp 1.44 [95% ci 1.24 to 1.68];
week 42 rp 1.63 [95% ci 1.27 to 2.08]; and week 52 rp 1.74 [95%
ci 1.31 o 2.31]). in line with these data, the percentage of
patients with an ap level ⱖ120 u/l increased over time in the
control group and decreased over time in the  xxxd1701xxx  group
(figure 2).

in this post hoc analysis of pooled data from phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, after adjustment for baseline characteristics, including baseline ap,
serum ap was reduced in a greater proportion of patients who
were receiving  xxxd1701xxx  compared with patients who received
traditional care alone when examined overall and in the subgroup of patients who achieved a ⱖ20% reduction. moreover,
the proportion of patients with ap ⱖ120 u/l decreased during

levels of bone-specific ap at week 26 (13). this study offers
several novel and important contributions. first, this study is
based on data from multiple trials and includes a greater number of patients. second, it provides a more comprehensive
examination of the relationship between  xxxd1701xxx  and ap by

assessing the time course of the effects of  xxxd1701xxx  on ap and
assessing the strength of the effect through various cut points in
ap. last, this study examines the effect of  xxxd1701xxx  on serum
total ap, rather than bone-specific ap. importantly, recent studies demonstrated an association between elevated serum ap
and mortality in patients who received hemodialysis (10 –12).
given these findings, the results of this study are of particular
interest.
 xxxd1701xxx , like all of the type ii calcimimetics, modulates the
activity of the  xxxg343xxx , increasing the sensitivity of parathyroid cells to extracellular calcium and thereby
decreasing pth secretion (18). pth is a key driver of physiologic and pathophysiologic bone turnover (19) (partially
through osteoblastic mechanisms [20]), and elevated pth levels are associated with high turnover bone disease (19), increased risk for fracture-related hospitalization (8), and bone
loss (evidenced by decreases in bone mineral density) (21).
increased serum bone ap can reflect high-turnover bone disease in patients with ckd (22), and preclinical evidence has
linked elevated ap activity and vascular calcification (23,24).

mortality (10 –12), direct causal connections have not yet been
determined.
vitamin d sterols and phosphate binders are traditionally
used in the treatment of shpt (25); therefore, we sought to
assess whether their use may have confounded the observed
reductions in ap during  xxxd1701xxx  treatment. both the frequency of use and dosage of vitamin d sterols and phosphate
binders among the control and  xxxd1701xxx  groups were similar
from baseline to week 52, with the exception of a slight increase
in phosphate binder dosage among  xxxd1701xxx -treated patients
at week 26. these results suggest that differences in vitamin d
sterol or phosphate binder use are unlikely to have contributed
to the observed differences in ap between the  xxxd1701xxx  and
control groups. these findings are not surprising considering
that studies analyzed were designed to encourage stable dosages of vitamin d sterols and phosphate binders. for example,
block et al. (13) did not report an appreciable difference in
vitamin d sterol use between the  xxxd1701xxx  and control groups.
one potential mechanism by which  xxxd1701xxx  may have
reduced ap is through reductions in serum pth. in this study,
 xxxd1701xxx  treatment resulted in a rapid decrease in serum pth
levels. there was a moderate but significant correlation between the change from baseline pth and change from baseline
ap; however, despite the correlation between pth and ap,
there remained a substantial degree of variability in ap that
could not be explained solely by the involvement of pth.
moreover, there was a difference in the time course of the
response in pth and ap as evidenced by the increasing
strength of the correlation over time. these data suggest that, as
a marker, ap may reflect bone dynamics in a slow or dampened manner, whereas pth responds more quickly. it is also
possible that  xxxd1701xxx  may have directly regulated ap synthe-

sis by osteoblasts, which have been shown to express the  xxxg343xxx  (26,27).
shpt has been associated with increased fractures (28), hospitalizations (8), and increased mortality (8,10), which may, in
varying degrees, be linked directly with bone disease; however,
it is also possible that the weakened bone associated with renal
osteodystrophy may not be the primary cause of the increased
mortality associated with ap. instead, it may act as a surrogate
marker for biochemical sequelae of high bone turnover, particularly elevated serum calcium and phosphorus, themselves
associated with increased vascular calcification (29), cardiovascular mortality (9), and all-cause mortality (8,9). moreover,
elevated serum phosphorus has been associated with increased
cardiovascular hospitalization (8). preclinical (30) evidence suggests that renal osteodystrophy may contribute to vascular
calcification in hemodialysis patients, and elevations in ap
have been associated with an increase in the risk for vascular
calcification in a study of pooled patients with stages 4 and 5
ckd (5). further studies to examine these associations are
required.
mortality risk in dialysis patients is substantially greater than
for those who have ckd and are not receiving dialysis (31), and
much interest has focused on the reduction of pth through the
use of  xxxd1701xxx  or vitamin d sterols as a means to minimize
this risk. at present, there are no reports of randomized, prospective clinical trials that have investigated the effects of such
therapies on mortality in dialysis patients. as a consequence,
treatment decisions have been forced to rely on results from
post hoc analyses of prospective studies ( xxxd1701xxx ) (16) and
observational studies (vitamin d sterols) (9,32). overall, it is
clear that additional studies are necessary to confirm any associations between existing therapies for ckd-mbd and patient

outcomes. accordingly, prospective, randomized studies designed to determine definitively the ability of  xxxd1701xxx  to
improve patient bone health, reduce vascular calcification, and
confer a survival benefit in dialysis patients are ongoing.
the data in these analyses were derived from three large,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies and an
extension study, involving patients from the united states,
europe, and australia. this provided a data set with random
allocation of  xxxd1701xxx  use across different dialysis populations
and helped minimize confounding that is common in observational data. although the initial data came from randomized,
controlled trials, the use of a population subset inherent in this
type of secondary analysis may have resulted in an imbalance
in baseline characteristics. accordingly, our analyses used multivariate techniques that allowed for the control of multiple
characteristics in case residual confounding was introduced by
combining data from several trials. in an effort to avoid the
potentially misleading results that could arise from estimating
odds ratios in cohort studies (33), we estimated the relative
likelihood using a log-binomial model and included, at each
time point, only patients who had data at that time point.
there are, however, limitations to this analysis. first, although it was advantageous to use data from randomized
trials, it should be acknowledged that, as with other controlled
trials, the population in our analysis may be different from that
in actual clinical practice. furthermore, by design, the parent
and the extension trials had different follow-up times, and only
patients from two of the parent trials were eligible for entry into
the extension trial upon completion of the parent trial (week
26). thus, fewer patients were able to be analyzed for time
points past week 26. moreover, although these analyses provided data on the overall effect of  xxxd1701xxx  on ap with respect
to traditional therapies, they did not examine dosage-related
effects. in addition, these analyses examined total serum ap
and not the bone-specific variety. evidence suggests that the
bone-specific variety is a more sensitive measure of bone turnover (22). finally, because the estimates at weeks 42 and 52
were based on a smaller population, the data should be interpreted cautiously.

conclusions
 xxxd1701xxx  treatment resulted in reductions in serum ap
levels in patients who had shpt and were receiving hemodialysis. further studies to examine the associations among  xxxd1701xxx , ap, and clinical outcomes are needed to determine the
clinical significance of these findings.
