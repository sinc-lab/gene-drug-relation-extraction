summary--the displacement of [ 3h](-)-nicotine from its binding site in rat cerebral cortex by a number
of antagonists was investigated. [3h](-)-nicotine appeared to bind to a single site with a dissociation
constant (ko) of 5.5 rim; pancuronium,  xxxd2174xxx  and  xxxd3439xxx  displaced [3h](-)-nicotine with
inhibition constants (/(i) of 57, 99 and 621/am, respectively, whereas  xxxd2550xxx  only displaced 50%
of nicotine binding in concentration > 1 mm. for hexamethonium and (+)- xxxd3456xxx  the displacement
of [3h](-)-nicotine binding appeared to involve two sites; the higher affinity site comprising 30% of the
total binding for hexamethonium but 76*/, of the sites for (+)-tuboeurarine.
in the presence of  xxxd2550xxx  (100ttm) the displacement of [3h](-)-nicotine binding by (+) xxxd3456xxx  appeared to involve only a single site with an affinity similar to that for the high affinity
site in the absence of meeamylamine whereas that for hexamethonium still involved two sites. it is
suggested that (+)- xxxd3456xxx  may act at both the binding site for [3h](-)-nicotine per se and also at
an allosteric site. the failure of  xxxd2550xxx  to influence the binding of hexamethonium suggests that
there may be more than one allosteric site or that hexamethonium may distinguish between subtypes of
nicotine receptors in the cortex.
key words--nicotine receptors, rat cortex, allosterism, nicotine, antagonists.

recently a gene family encoding neuronal nicotinic
cholinoceptors within the rat central nervous system
has been identified; this family includes genes encoding putative ~t-subunits (ct2, ~t3, ~t4 and cq) as well as
putative fl-subunits (f12, f13 and 1/4; deneris, connolly,
rogers and duvoisin, 1991). further, these subunits
appear to be differentially distributed (wada, wada,
boulter, deneris, heinemann, patrick and swanson,
1989; deneris et al., 1991) suggesting the possibility
of multiple subtypes of nicotine cholinoceptors. this
possibility is strengthened by the expression of cloned
nicotine cholinoceptors in xenopus oocytes with
properties resembling functional receptors; both the
ct- and fl-subunits contribute to the pharmacological
characteristics of nicotine cholinoceptors (wada,
ballivet, boulter, connolly, wada, deneris, swanson, heinemann and patrick, 1988; luetje, wada,
rogers, abramson, tsuji, heinemann and patrick,
1990; luetje and patrick, 1991; deneris et al., 1991;
papke and heinemann, 1991).
while there is evidence of variation in the sensitivity of agonists at cloned nicotine receptors (luetje
and patrick, 1991), studies with [3h](-)-nicotine in
rat brain indicate that the binding appears to be to a

single high affinity site (lipiello and fernandes, 1986;
1988; lipiello, sears and fernandes, 1987; reavill,
jenner, kumar and stolerman, 1988). a characteristic of the binding site for the [3h]agonist ligand is
that many classical nicotine receptor antagonists such
as hexamethonium and  xxxd2550xxx  show low
apparent affinity, although other antagonists including dihydro-fl-erythroidine (clark, pert and pert,
1984; williams and robinson, 1984; martinobarrows and kellar, 1987) or neosurugatoxin
(hayashi, isogai, kagawa, takayanagi and yamada,
1984; yamada, isogai, kagawa, takayanagi,
hayashi, tsuji and kosuge, 1985; yamada, kagawa,
takayanagi, nakayama, tsuji, kosuge, hayashi,
okada and inoue, 1987) bind with high affinity. it has
been suggested that the reason for the low affinity
shown by some antagonists may be related to their
binding at an allosteric site on the receptor ionophore
complex possibly at a site within the channel rather
than at the binding site for nicotine (schwartz,
mcgee and kellar, 1982; lipiello and fernandes,
1988; wonnacott, 1990). in this respect there is
conflicting evidence from functional studies for some
antagonists; the interaction of  xxxd2550xxx  at
neuronal nicotine receptors has been described as
competitive (ascher, large and rang, 1979) or noncompetitive (bennett, tyler and zaimis, 1957; trendelenburg, 1961) and in the central nervous system it
has been suggested to exhibit both competitive and
847

non-competitive activity (martin, onaivi and martin,
1989; martin, suchocki, may and martin, 1990).
binding studies suggest  xxxd2550xxx  may act allosterically within the central nervous system
(takayama, majewska and london, 1989; bannerjee, punzi, kreilick and abood, 1990). similarly,
evidence of competitive (trendelenburg, 1961) and
non-competitive behaviour for hexamethonium has
been reported (ascher et al., 1979; rang, 1982),
although results from binding studies have led to the
conclusion of a competitive interaction at central
nicotinic receptors (yamada et al., 1987; takayama
et al., 1989). however, in the majority of competition
studies with antagonists there has been little evidence
as to whether the antagonists show characteristics of
competitive inhibition at a single site or whether the
binding may be better described by interaction at
more than one site. this is so whether [3h](-)nicotine (lipiello and fernandes, 1986; marks,
stitzel, romm, wehner and collins, 1986; kellar,
schwartz and martino, 1987; martino-barrows
and kellar, 1987), [3h]acetylcholine (schwartz
et al., 1982; marks et al., 1986; kellar et al.,
1987; martino-barrows and kellar, 1987) or
[3h]methylcarbamylcholine (boksa and quirion,
1987) was used as the [3h]agonist ligand.
in this study of nicotinic receptors in the rat cortex
a detailed analysis of displacement curves for antagonists using [3h](-)-nicotine as the ligand was undertaken to determine whether interaction at one or
more binding sites for the antagonists could be
detected.
methods

membrane preparation

young adult (3-4 months) hooded wistar rats
(280-350 g) of either sex were killed by decapitation
and the brains rapidly removed and cortex dissected
free and homogenized (ultraturrax 2/3 maximum for
15 sec) in 10 volumes of ice cold modified hepes
buffer ("preparative" buffer; composition in mm:
na:hpo4, 8; kh2po4, 1.5; kci, 3; naci, 120;
hepes, 20; edta, 2; iodoacetamide, 5; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1; ph 7.4 at 0°c).
the homogenate was incubated at 37°c for 10 rain
to promote endogenous acetyicholine hydrolysis, and
centrifuged (17,000g for 20 min, 0°c). the pellet was
resuspended in 20 volumes of ice-cold distilled h20
for 60 min.
the resulting homogenate was centrifuged
(17,000g for 20 min, 0°c) and the pellet was resuspended in 10 volumes of ice cold modified hepes
buffer ("wash buffer" composition in mm: na2hpo 4,
8: kh2po4, 1.5; kci, 3; naci, 120; hepes, 20;
mgci2, 1; caci2, 2.5; ph 7.4 at 0°c). following an
incubation at 37°c for 10 min, the homogenate was
recentrifuged as before and the pellet resuspended in
10 volumes of "wash buffer" ready for use in the
assay.

binding assays

the binding of l-(-)-[n-methyl-3h]nicotine was
determined in saturation studies by the addition of
aliquots of membrane suspension (100-200/zg protein) to polystyrene tubes containing (0.1-100nm)
[3h](-)-nicotine in wash buffer (final volume 250 ~1)
and incubated for 20 min at 22°c in a shaking water
bath. assays were terminated by the addition of 4 ml
ice cold wash buffer and rapid filtration under vacuum through whatman gf/b filters. the filters had
been soaked overnight in wash buffer containing
0.5% (vol/vol) polyethylenimine. following the initial filtration of the assay mixture filters were washed
twice more with ice cold wash buffer (4 ml each) and
air dried. radioactivity retained on the filters was
determined by adding 10ml of scintillation fluid
(filter count s packard) and counting each filter in a
packard liquid scintillation counter as dpm; corrections for counting efficiency being made. specific
binding of [ 3h](-)-nicotine was defined as the difference in the amount of [3h](-)-nicotine bound in the
absence and presence of i mm carbachol.
the effects of the nicotine cholinoceptor antagonists on displacement of [3h](-)-nicotine binding were
examined by testing 18-25 different concentrations of
the antagonist by co-incubation with the [3h]agonist
ligand. in some experiments a fixed concentration
of  xxxd2550xxx  (100/~m) was included during
displacement studies with nicotine cholinoceptor antagonists. in these cases total binding of [3h](-)nicotine was defined as the difference in the amount
of [3h](-)-nicotine bound in the absence and presence of 100/~m  xxxd2550xxx  and 1 mm carbachol.
all assays were performed in duplicate. protein
was determined according to the method of lowry,
rosebrough, farr and randall (1951) using bovine
 xxxg124xxx  as standard after extraction from the
membrane suspension with 10% trichloroacetic acid.
data analysis

data from saturation studies or competition studies were analysed by iterative curve fitting using the
computer programme ebda which provides estimates of dissociation constants (kd) for saturation
studies and ic50 (concentration of drug inhibiting
50% of specific binding) for competition studies
together with the slope factor (pseudo-hill coefficient) (mcpherson, 1983). more detailed analyses
using these estimates were performed using the iterative non-linear curve fitting programme l i g a n d
(munson and rodbard, 1980). competition data
were analysed according to a model for the binding
of the competing drug to one or two binding sites. a
two site model was considered satisfactory where the
data fitted significantly better than to a one site
binding model (p < 0.05). final parameters were
obtained by simultaneously analysing the data curves
from multiple experiments to increase statistical reliability (de lean, hancock and lefkowitz, 1982).

849

these analyses provided estimates of the kd (dissociation constant) and b~= (density of binding sites)
in saturation studies. in competition studies kt (inhibition constant for a single binding site) or kn and kl
(inhibition constants for high- and low-affinity binding sites) together with the relative proportions of the
high- and low-affinity sites were estimated. the standard error estimates generated along with these parameters were converted to 95% confidence limits
(munson and rodbard, 1980).

nicotine bound to these sites with a kd of 5.49 nm
(4.87-6.19, 95% confidence limits) and a maximal
binding capacity (bm~) of 8 i. 3 -t-_4.9 fmol/mg protein
(n = 8). hill analysis yielded an na value of 0.94
(0.81-1.07, 95% confidence limits) which was not
significantly different from unity. analysing the saturation data with a one and two site model using the
l i g a n d program, indicated no significant preference (p > 0.05 f-test) for a two site as opposed to a
one site model.

results

[3h](--)nicotine binding to rat cerebral cortical
membranes
in membrane preparations of rat cerebral cortex
the specific binding of [3h](-)-nicotine displayed
saturable binding to an apparently single population
of sites. scatchard analysis indicated that [3h](-)-

a number of nicotine cholinoceptor antagonists
that displayed varying affinities for either ganglionic
or neuromuscular nicotine cholinoceptors were assessed for their ability to displace specifically bound
[3h](-)-nicotine (10nm) from membrane preparations of rat cerebral cortex.
the order of potency of these antagonists in inhibiting [3h](-)-nicotine is shown in fig. i. slope
factors for hexamethonium,  xxxd2550xxx  and
 xxxd3456xxx  were significantly different from unity
(table 1) indicating a non-homogeneous population
of binding sites.
the existence of such sites was examined by
analysing the inhibition data with one and two site
models using the l i g a n d program which assumes
competitive kinetics for interaction at each site; a
significant preference was found for a two site model
for hexamethonium and  xxxd3456xxx  and a one site
model for  xxxd2174xxx , pancuronium and  xxxd3439xxx 
(table 1).

discussion

the findings of the present study show that in
membranes of rat cerebral cortex [3h](-)-nicotine
appeared to bind to a single population of sites with
a kd of 5.49 nm and b ~ of 81.3 fmol/mg protein. in
general the nicotinic cholinoceptor antagonists were
rather weak in displacing [3h](-)-nicotine from its
binding site, as first reported by romano and
goldstein (1980). it has been suggested that the low
potency of classical antagonists such as hexamethonium and mccamylamine in displacing [3i-i](-)nicotine binding may be due to the conversion of the
binding site into an "agonist-selective" state. however, this possibility is unlikely since antagonists such
as dihydro-fl-erythroidine, neosurugatoxin and
methyl-lycaconitine show relatively high potency in
binding studies (see wonnacott 1990). comparing
ics0 values (fig. 1), the order of potency of the
antagonists was (+)- xxxd3456xxx  > pancuronium
>  xxxd2174xxx  > hexamethonium >  xxxd3439xxx  >
 xxxd2550xxx . these data compare favourably with
values obtained in previous studies (lippiello and
fernandes, 1986; martino-barrows and keuar, 1987;
marks et al., 1986; for a review see wonnacott, 1990).
detailed analysis of the displacement curves in terms
of a competitive interaction at one or more sties sites
however indicate that hexamethonium and ( + )  xxxd3456xxx  displaced [3h](-)-nicotine from its
binding site with dual affinity. one explanation of the
findings is that allosteric sites on the nicotine receptor
ionophore complex are involved in the binding of
some antagonists; thus binding to this site for hexamethonium represents 70% of the total binding
whereas for (+)- xxxd3456xxx  it was only ca25%.
(+)- xxxd3456xxx  and hexamethonium have been
shown to act allosterically at neuronal nicotinic receptors (ascher, marty and neild, 1978; ascher et al.,
1979; rang, 1982), the allosteric site may be associated with the channel portion of the receptor ionophore complex although allosteric binding sites
outside of the channel are also known (okonjo,
kuhlmann and maelicke, 1991).  xxxd2550xxx  can
also bind to an allosteric site at central nicotine
receptors (bannerjee et al., 1990). the extremely
shallow competition curve for  xxxd2550xxx  obtained in the present study suggests an allosteric
interaction is occurring; concentrations > 1 mm were
required to produce 50% inhibition of [3h](-)nicotine binding.
studies were undertaken to see if the presence of
 xxxd2550xxx  (100#m) modified the competition
curves for (+)- xxxd3456xxx  and hexamethonium on
the basis that, in the presence of a drug binding to an
allosteric site, the binding of drugs that interacted
both competitively and allosterically would show
only the competitive component. drugs acting only

851

competitively, such as pancuronium, would be unaffected. this situation appeared to be the case with
(+)- xxxd3456xxx ; binding in the presence of
 xxxd2550xxx  became competitive as the displacement curve was described adequately by a one site fit.
however, the presence of  xxxd2550xxx  did not
modify the binding of hexamethonium or of pancuronium (cf. table 1 upper and lower sections). the
findings with  xxxd2550xxx  in combination with
(+)- xxxd3456xxx  or hexamethonium suggest that a
number of allosteric sites may exist at the nicotine
receptor; (+)- xxxd3456xxx  is reacting with a site
directly affected by  xxxd2550xxx  whereas hexamethonium may be interacting at one which is not
influenced by the presence of  xxxd2550xxx . multiple sites of action for noncompetitive inhibitors or
for  xxxd2940xxx  have been reported for nicotine receptors
in torpedo marmorata (heidmann, oswald and
changeaux, 1983; okonjo et al., 1991); ascher et al
(1978) have suggested that the channel binding sites
are different for (+)- xxxd3456xxx  and hexamethonium in aplysia neurons. also, the two antagonists
have different sites of action on avian neuronal
nicotinic receptors reconstituted in xenopus oocytes
(bertrand, ballivet and rungger, 1990). the alternative possibility, that [ 3h](-)-nicotine would bind to
two populations of sites with equal affinity whereas
(+)- xxxd3456xxx  and hexamethonium show a selectivity for one population of sites over the other
appears unlikely. this alternative would suggest that
there is a ca 20-fold difference in affinity of ( + )  xxxd3456xxx  and hexamethonium for the major
population (70-80%) of binding sites (16.7 vs
322 #m) (table 1). such a difference in affinity does
not correlate with the findings from functional studies
on prejunctional facilitatory autoreceptors on cholinergic nerves, a major site of nicotine receptors in the
cortex (araujo, lapchak, collier and quirion, 1988;
lapchak, araujo, quirion and collier, 1989; tilson,
schwartz, ali and mclamb, 1989). studies on rat
cerebral cortical slices measuring [3h]acetylcholine
release induced by electrical stimulation have shown
that the facilitatory action of nicotine (3/~m) on
[3h]acetylcholine output is inhibited by ( + )  xxxd3456xxx  (1 #m) or hexamethonium (3 #m) to
a similar extent (loiacono and mitcheison, 1990;
loiacono, unpublished).
in conclusion, it is suggested that (+)- xxxd3456xxx 
binds to nicotine receptors at the active site and in
high concentrations at an allosteric site; in the presence of  xxxd2550xxx  the binding to the latter site
is reduced. binding of  xxxd2174xxx , pancuronium and
 xxxd3439xxx  appears to be competitive and binding of
pancuronium was not influenced by  xxxd2550xxx .
hexamethonium may also bind to a second site on
the receptor; this site does not appear to be the same
as that for (+)- xxxd3456xxx .
