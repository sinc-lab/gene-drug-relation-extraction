abstract
central precocious puberty is commonly treated by gonadotropin releasing hormone (gnrh) agonists. to compare modes
of action and effectiveness of gnrh analogues and assess treatment combinations of agonistic ( xxxd3445xxx ) and antagonistic
( xxxd466xxx  acetate) gnrh analogues with established treatment,
we used prepubertal 31-d-old ovariectomized female rats. strongest inhibition of lh and fsh occurred after 2-d treatment with
antagonist alone (lh 0.08 ⫾ 0.02 versus 3.2 ⫾ 0.56 ng/ml in
controls; fsh 10.8 ⫾ 2.8 versus 44.2 ⫾ 5.0 ng/ml in controls,
p ⬍ 0.001). combined agonist/antagonist was second most
effective of the treatments (after 5 d treatment, lh 0.52 ⫾ 0.15
versus 4.9 ⫾ 1.1 ng/ml in controls; p ⬍ 0.01). pituitary gonadotropin subunit lh␤ mrna levels were inhibited in all groups
except controls, but pituitary  xxxg931xxx  mrna was stimulated by agonist yet unaffected by combined analogues. explanted ovaries were incubated with either analogue, both 10⫺6
m. after 4 h,  xxxg931xxx  mrna levels were significantly
reduced by antagonist but not agonist. to verify pubertyinhibiting effects of gnrh analogues, we used 26-d-old female
rats with androgen-induced precocious puberty after injecting

the episodic gnrh release from the hypothalamic gnrh
pulse generator, controlled by excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters as well as neuropeptides and glial factors, induces
the pulsatile discharge of gonadotropins from the pituitary
gland, triggering a cascade of events resulting in the onset of
puberty (1– 6). this phenomenon has led to clinical use of
gnrh agonists in treating central precocious puberty due to
premature release of gnrh (7, 8). rather than a direct causative arresting of puberty, the pharmacodynamics of gnrh

subcutaneously single 300 ␮g  xxxd1806xxx  on postnatal d 5. single
application of  xxxd466xxx  depot ( xxxd466xxx  embonate) reduced
serum estradiol levels and pituitary lh␤ expression; gnrh
receptor mrna levels were down-regulated in the pituitary and
ovary (p ⬍ 0.05). in androgen-induced precocious puberty
model, single injection of antagonist effectively arrests premature
hormonal activation and down-regulates pituitary and ovarian
gnrh receptors. we conclude that gnrh analogue combination
and especially antagonist alone treatment most directly suppress
gonadotropin levels. this implies that early treatment gonadotropin flare-up associated with agonist treatment is avoidable.

agonists involve an initial activation of lh and sex steroid
secretion (“flare-up phase” after the first injection), followed
by reduced lh levels by desensitization of pituitary gnrh
receptors (9). prolongation of the recommended application
interval bears the risk of a reiterative massive reactivation of
gonadotropin secretion. treatment management is typically
long-term, requiring iterative monitoring—some patients will
need either higher amounts of the agonist than the recommended initial doses or shorter injection intervals. if this is
noticed too late, the opposite of the aimed, inhibitory effect will
be observed (10 –12).
in contrast to agonists, antagonistic gnrh analogues act by
competitive binding to the pituitary gnrh receptors, thereby
preventing the action of endogenous gnrh (13). theoretically,
antagonists could offer an almost immediate, direct, and dosedependent alternative for treating precocious puberty. in pre-

precocious puberty—gnrh analogues

pubertal/peripubertal female rats, short-acting  xxxd466xxx  acetate inhibits pubertal development (14). the commercially
available formulation of the antagonist  xxxd466xxx ,  xxxd466xxx ,
introduced 1999, was developed as a concomitant in assisted
reproduction, exerting gonadotropin inhibition of 1 to 3 d
duration after a single s.c. injection. this short duration of
action is suboptimal for the typical long-term treatment of
precocious puberty, as children would need at least 10 injections per month instead of a more desirable one-injection-permonth, long-acting depot gnrh analogue.
another consideration in the management of precocious
puberty is estrogen, which plays a critical role in the growth
and development of reproductive tissues, as well as in sexual
differentiation and fertility. these biologic actions are exerted
by the binding of estrogen to er (15). there are two known
types of er, ␣ and ␤ (16). from these er, splice variants have
been identified that are tissue-specific expressed (17, 18). the
proteins encoded by these isoforms are believed to be important modulators of the tissue- and promoter-specific effects of
estradiol.
the purpose of the first experiment in this study was to
investigate whether a combination of the established gnrh
agonist  xxxd3445xxx  along with the gnrh antagonist  xxxd466xxx 
acetate is more effective in suppressing gonadotropin levels
than the established gnrh agonist treatment or the nonestablished gnrh antagonist treatment, and to look for the effects
on hypothalamic and pituitary expression of several genes that
are involved in the regulation of sexual maturation. in the first
experiment, ovariectomized rats were used as this model is
suitable for studying gonadotropin suppressant effects of
gnrh analogues. the explanted ovaries were investigated to
verify direct ovarian gonadotropin-independent effects of both
gnrh analogues that we found in recent studies when we
analyzed puberty-inhibiting effects of gnrh analogues in normal peribubertal rats (14, 19) and demonstrated their influence
on ovarian  xxxg931xxx  expression. because these same
studies indicated that the gnrh antagonist  xxxd466xxx  has advantages both in speed and directness when controlling precocious puberty, in the second experiment of this study we tested
the effects of a new long-acting depot preparation of the gnrh
antagonist  xxxd466xxx ,  xxxd466xxx  embonate, using a female rat
model of androgen-induced precocious puberty and investigated the gene expression of gnrh and its receptor as well as
different estrogen receptors at the hypothalamic, pituitary,
ovarian, and uterine levels.

1 injections.  xxxd466xxx  acetate used in this experiment was
provided as a nondepot preparation by asta medica, frankfurt/
main, germany, dissolvable in distilled water.  xxxd3445xxx  was
purchased from bachem, bubendorf, switzerland. blood samples were taken from the tail vein after the second injection and
from the trunk after decapitation 5 h after the fifth (final)
injection. brains and pituitaries were rapidly collected and
immediately frozen on ice. tissues were stored at ⫺70°c until
analysis. hypothalamic and pituitary mrna levels for gnrh,
 xxxg931xxx , er␣ and ␤, and gonadotropin subunit lh␤
were measured by quantitative taqman pcr.
to investigate potential direct ovarian effects of gnrh
analogues, explanted ovaries were incubated with gnrh analogues in vitro. the bursa of explanted ovaries was rapidly
removed and ovaries were randomized and incubated in dulbecco minimal medium, 10 mm hepes buffer, 95%o2/
5%co2, 37°c, with  xxxd466xxx  10⫺6 m,  xxxd3445xxx  10⫺6 m, or
nacl 0.9%; each group consisted of 12–14 ovaries. medium
was changed every 30 min. after 4 h incubation, ovaries were
frozen in liquid nitrogen for gnrh and  xxxg931xxx  mrna
analysis by taqman pcr.
in experiment 2, 5-d-old female rats were randomized into
two groups. they were treated with either a single s.c. injection
of 300 ␮g  xxxd1806xxx  in 0.2 ml saline (18 animals— group dan)
to induce precocious puberty, or a single s.c. injection of 0.2
ml saline (11 animals— controls, group co), according to a
method published by morishita et al. (20). they were weighed
and monitored daily for vaginal opening marking the beginning
of puberty. at d 26, the 18  xxxd1806xxx -treated rats were randomized further into two groups (9 animals each). rats were treated
intraperitoneally with a single 0.4 ml injection of either 300

room temperature, free access to water and fed ad libitum).
in experiment 1, animals were randomized into four groups,
each consisting of 10 –11 animals. each animal was marked
with a code on the tail for identification purposes. on postnatal

serum hormones. serum levels of lh, fsh, and estradiol
were determined using established ria-methods. estradiol
was measured using a sensitive commercial ria (diagnostic
systems laboratories, webster, tx, u.s.a.) with a lower
detection limit of 1.2 pg/ml. reference preparations were rp2
for both lh and fsh. for iodination, lh i-6 and fsh i-7 were
used. to achieve maximum sensitivity, 100 ␮l serum was
used for lh and fsh measurements. each assay was performed with freshly prepared tracer, which had been purified
by fplc-column chromatography on superdex 75 column
(amersham pharmacia biotech, freiburg, germany). the antibodies were niaddk rat-s7 (lh) and niaddk rat-s11
(fsh). the sensitivity limits were 0.05 ng/ml (lh) and 0.4
ng/ml (fsh). the intra- and interassay coefficients of variation from replicates of pooled samples from ovariectomized
rats were 7.5% and 11.5% (lh), and 8.5% and 13.5% (fsh).
rna preparation and real-time rt-pcr. rna isolation
from the anterior pituitary, micropunches of the poa, and
tissues of the mbh, ovary, and uterus of each animal was
carried out with the rneasy total rna kit (qiagen gmbh,
hilden, germany) as described in detail in our recent study
(19). depending on the tissue, 10 –50 ng rna/␮l was used for
the rt. the rt reaction proceeded at 22°c for 10 min and
42°c for 50 min, with 15 ng (gnrh poa) to 250 ng (gnrh
receptor uterus) total rna. the reaction mixture contained 5
ng/␮l random primers, 1 ⫻ reaction buffer, 10 mm dtt, 500
nm deoxy-ntps, 200 u superscript reverse transcriptase (all
reagents from invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, u.s.a.) and 10 u
ribonuclease inhibitor (promega, mannheim, germany) in a
final volume of 20 ␮l. at the end of incubation, the samples
were heated at 95°c for 10 min to inactivate the enzyme and
denature rna-cdna hybrids. the mrna levels were quantified using taqman real-time rt-pcr as described in detail in
our recent study (19). gene-specific pcr primer pairs and the

hybridization probes were designed using the primer express
software (applied biosystems, foster city, ca, u.s.a.). the
sequences according to different genes and the genbank accession numbers are shown in table 1. each pcr run included
7 points of the standard curve, a no template control, and the
sample cdna. amplification reactions (25 ␮l) contained 12.5
␮l taqman buffer (perkinelmer life sciences, boston, ma,
u.s.a.), 300 –900 nm of each primer, 225 nm hybridization
probe, and 4 ␮l cdna. each pcr product was cloned into the
pcr ii-topo plasmid following the manufacturer’s instructions (invitrogen) to generate crna for standard curves.
statistical evaluation and mathematical calculations. unless otherwise stated, results are presented as mean ⫾ sem. as
normal distributions could not be assumed, all data from the
ria and pcr analysis were statistically evaluated with the
kruskal-wallis test followed by dunn’s test to compare multiple groups. differences were considered significant if p ⬍
0.05. the analysis was performed by using the prism program
(graphpad software, san diego, ca, u.s.a.).
results
experiment 1, ovariectomized rats,  xxxd3445xxx  alone and in
combination with  xxxd466xxx . the lowest lh and fsh levels in
experiment 1 were measured in group ct3 after two injections
of  xxxd466xxx -only treatment, single injection per day (before
treatment on d 3 with a combination of  xxxd466xxx  plus gnrh
agonist  xxxd3445xxx ). lh and fsh levels at the same time point
were also significantly reduced in group ct5 ( xxxd466xxx  combined with  xxxd3445xxx  from d 1), but not in group t5 ( xxxd3445xxx 
treatment alone). table 2 provides an overview of treatment
group comparisons. after injection on the fifth treatment day
(single injection per day), lh and fsh levels were significantly reduced in both combined-treatment groups, ct3 and
ct5, but compared with precombined treatment values before
d 3 in group ct3, there was a significant increase of lh and
fsh in group ct3 after combining  xxxd466xxx  with  xxxd3445xxx 
(table 2).
gnrh expression was investigated in the poa of the hypothalamus, where gnrh neurons are located. there were no

(poa, mbh) was comparable in all groups (data not shown),
whereas the pituitary  xxxg931xxx  was up-regulated in
group t5 (fig. 2a).
pituitary expression of the gonadotropin subunit lh␤ was
significantly reduced in groups ct3 and ct5 (fig. 2b).
er␣ and er␤ mrna levels were determined in the pituitary. er␣ levels were comparable in all groups, but er␤
levels were significantly stimulated in group ct3 (fig. 2c).
in explanted ovaries, gnrh expression was detectable but
there were no significant differences among the treatment
groups (data not shown).  xxxg931xxx  expression was significantly reduced after incubation with  xxxd466xxx  but not by
 xxxd3445xxx  (fig. 3).
experiment 2,  xxxd1806xxx -induced precocious puberty,  xxxd466xxx  depot. at age of 23–26 d, vaginal opening occurred in all
but two  xxxd1806xxx  treated rats, which occurred in our colony
32–37 d in the majority of untreated rats, indicating onset of
puberty (19). after treatment with  xxxd466xxx  depot (group
dancet) or saline (groups co and dan), the weight gain and
body weights at d 29 were similar in all three groups (data not
shown). none of the control animals showed pubertal signs on
d 29. at time of decapitation, serum estradiol levels in danazoltreated rats (group dan) were higher compared with controls,
but lower in group dancet animals treated with a single
injection of  xxxd466xxx  depot (fig. 4).
gnrh expression was determined in the poa. the groups
dan and dancet had slightly but not significantly lower gnrh
expression in the poa (fig. 5a). ovarian gnrh expression
was slightly reduced in group dancet (data not shown) and
uterine gnrh mrna levels were lower in groups dan and
dancet (fig. 5b).
after treatment with  xxxd466xxx  in  xxxd1806xxx -pretreated rats
(group dancet), the  xxxg931xxx  expression was stimulated
in the hypothalamus (fig. 6a) but down-regulated in the pituitary and ovary (fig. 6, b and c). there were no detectable
differences between the groups in the uterus (data not shown).
pituitary gonadotropin subunit lh␤ expression was significantly reduced in group dancet (fig. 7).

er␣ mrna levels, determined in the pituitary, ovary, and
uterus, and pituitary er␤ mrna levels did not show significant changes among the groups (data not shown). er␤ mrna
levels were inhibited by  xxxd466xxx  in the ovary and uterus (fig.
8, a and b).
discussion
in the first part of our study we used ovariectomized rats to
test whether a combination of the established gnrh agonist
 xxxd3445xxx  with a short-acting gnrh antagonist  xxxd466xxx  acetate is more effective and faster in suppressing gonadotropin
levels. the results demonstrate that the combination treatment
of gnrh analogues is indeed more effective but the antagonist
alone most profoundly suppresses gonadotropin levels. this
means that the flare-up of gonadotropin secretion associated
with conventional agonist treatment can be avoided by using
either a combined analogue or antagonist alone treatment.
furthermore, we could show direct ovarian effects of  xxxd466xxx 
on  xxxg931xxx  expression in vitro, implying that the local
gnrh autoregulatory system of the ovary can be influenced by
gnrh antagonists. these peripheral effects have to be considered when deciding which gnrh analogue is most suitable for
treating precocious puberty. in the second part of our study we
demonstrated for the first time the puberty-arresting effects of
a long-acting gnrh antagonist,  xxxd466xxx  embonate, in a rat
model of androgen-induced precocious puberty using a single
 xxxd1806xxx  injection in neonatal rats. at age of 23–26 d, pubertal
signs occurred in the majority of  xxxd1806xxx  treated rats, confirming the model first described by morishita et al. (20) who found
true precocious puberty with elevated lh levels and advanced
onset of estrous cyclicity in  xxxd1806xxx -treated female rats.
to compare the effects of agonistic with antagonistic gnrh
analogues on gonadotropin secretion, in the first experiment we
used ovariectomized prepubertal female rats rather than intact
rats because lh and fsh levels in intact rats are very low at
the prepubertal age. as the signal transduction differs between
agonistic and antagonistic gnrh analogues, we studied the
effectiveness of a combination of the gnrh agonist  xxxd3445xxx 
with the gnrh antagonist  xxxd466xxx  acetate in suppressing
gonadotropin secretion. from a recent study with intact peripubertal female rats, we know that during 12-d treatment with

were treated with a single injection of depot gnrh antagonist  xxxd466xxx 
embonate (group dancet).

(group t5); (b) gonadotropin subunit lh␤ mrna significantly reduced in

levels significantly stimulated in delayed combination group (ct3).

daily  xxxd3445xxx  injections, serum gonadotropins are stimulated; whereas after the first injection with  xxxd466xxx , serum
gonadotropins are suppressed and are never stimulated
throughout treatment (14). in the present study with ovariectomized rats, gonadotropins dramatically dropped after two
injections of  xxxd466xxx  (group ct3) or  xxxd466xxx  combined
with  xxxd3445xxx  (group ct5), whereas during  xxxd3445xxx  treatment, gonadotropin levels were stimulated. pituitary gonado-

tropin subunit lh␤ expression was inhibited by  xxxd466xxx  with
or without combination with  xxxd3445xxx , but no significant
changes were detected by  xxxd3445xxx  alone. this finding reinforces the fast and direct gonadotropin-suppressant effects of
the gnrh antagonist.
gnrh mrna levels, analyzed in the poa where the
perikarya of gnrh neurons are located, showed high variations
and were unchanged after treatment with gnrh analogues or
precocious puberty– enducing  xxxd1806xxx . these results are similar to
those of our previous studies, where no changes of gnrh expression in the poa were found in the transition from prepubertal to
pubertal rats (21), nor after treatment of peripubertal female rats
with agonistic and antagonistic gnrh analogues (19). but it is yet
unknown what amounts of gnrh analogues pass the blood-brain
barrier and reach the gnrh perikarya and axon terminals.
in the second experiment of this study, gnrh mrna levels
could also be measured in the ovary and uterus. this is an
important finding. gnrh agonists have been found to directly
inhibit rat uterine cells (22). in our  xxxd1806xxx  precocious puberty–induced rats, uterine mrna levels remained low, independent of gnrh antagonist treatment. to further investigate this
phenomenon, it will be necessary to measure mrna levels at
different time points.

the  xxxg931xxx  itself is subject to regulation by gnrh
(23–25). pulsatile stimulation or low doses of gnrh upregulate its receptor, whereas high doses, continuous treatment,
or no exposure down-regulate the  xxxg931xxx  in the pituitary. the number of gnrh receptors correlates with the
sensitivity of the pituitary to gnrh (26). estradiol is known as
a positive regulator of  xxxg931xxx  gene expression in the
preovulatory period. an increased serum concentration of estradiol most likely causes elevation of pituitary  xxxg931xxx 
mrna, which precedes maximal numbers of gnrh receptors
before the lh surge. through this mechanism, maximal sensitivity of gonadotrophs to gnrh is achieved, indicating that
both gnrh and ovarian factors control the synthesis and
secretion of the gonadotropins (27, 28). in the first experiment
of our study, the up-regulated  xxxg931xxx  by  xxxd3445xxx  30
␮g/d is in line with our previous study, where  xxxg931xxx 
mrna levels were up-regulated by low-dose  xxxd3445xxx  (10
␮g/d) but not by high-dose  xxxd3445xxx  (100 ␮g/d) (19). in the
combination treatment of  xxxd3445xxx  with  xxxd466xxx  of the
present study, no changes of pituitary  xxxg931xxx  mrna
levels could by observed. this could be due to the lack of
estrogen in ovariectomized rats or caused by opposing, i.e.
stimulating and inhibiting, effects of both analogues that counteract each other’s effect. after treatment of intact animals with
depot-antagonist  xxxd466xxx  embonate, low pituitary gnrh re-

ceptor mrna levels indicate a down-regulation of gnrh
receptors. furthermore, ovarian  xxxg931xxx  mrna levels
were inhibited by  xxxd466xxx  in vivo as well as in vitro. this
means that, at least in the absence of pituitary hormones,
gnrh antagonists exert direct ovarian actions. furthermore,
 xxxg931xxx  expression was clearly detectable in both the
mbh and uterus.
two discrete nuclear er have been identified: the classic

were no significant changes of er␣ expression in different
tissues among the treatment groups. in experiment 1, pituitary

tion of the gonadotropin secretion known as the “flare-up”
effect. in contrast to the mandatory chronic administration of
the gnrh agonists, it has been demonstrated that it is possible
to titrate the gonadotropin suppressive effect using only one
injection of a gnrh antagonist (29). in  xxxd1806xxx -induced puberty, we chose a 3-d interval to investigate the effects of
 xxxd466xxx  depot. further experiments are needed for pharmacokinetic studies. other long-acting gnrh antagonists such as
 xxxd1826xxx  (30) and newly developed oral nonpeptide gnrh
antagonists that have been tested in rats, dogs and monkeys, are
potential drugs for puberty studies (31, 32).
we conclude that these data imply profound potential for
quick, direct, and more manageable treatment of precocious
puberty with gnrh antagonists rather than agonists. compared with gnrh antagonist-treatment alone, combinationtreatments of gnrh antagonistic with agonistic analogues
have no advantageous effects in suppressing gonadotropin
levels. but when long-acting depot preparations are only available as agonists, the combination of a short-acting antagonist
with a long-acting agonist could prevent the gonadotropin
“flare-up” at the beginning of agonist treatment. we should
also note that we found morishita’s female rat model of
androgen-induced precocious puberty suitable to study the
effects of puberty-inhibiting drugs and recommend it for further such studies.

this sequential combination activates other mechanisms than a
combined treatment administered from the beginning. in  xxxd1806xxx -induced precocious puberty rats, the lower ovarian and
uterine er␤ expression in  xxxd466xxx -treated rats is in line with
suppressed estrogen levels in these animals.
antagonistic gnrh analogues potentially offer a faster,
direct, and dose-dependent alternative for treating central precocious puberty compared with agonists without initial activa-
