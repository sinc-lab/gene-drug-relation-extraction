abstract: we found that  xxxd3564xxx  (zns) has beneficial effects on parkinson’s disease (pd).
zns is originally synthesized in japan and has been used for over 10 years to treat intractable
epilepsy. we administered 300 mg of zns to a patient with pd who incidentally had convulsive
attacks. the attacks disappeared and, surprisingly, the parkinsonian symptoms improved
dramatically. an open trial of zns (given in addition to their anti-pd drugs) in advanced pd
patients clearly showed the lessening of symptoms, especially wearing-off. although the effects
gradually decreased after 1.5 years, more than 30% improvement of updrs total score was
maintained up to 3 years. nation-wide double-blind controlled study confirmed that the small dose (50mg/day) of zns
improved all the cardinal symptoms of pd. as for its mechanism, we showed that zns increases dopamine contents in the
striatum by activating dopamine synthesis and the level of mrna of  xxxg2276xxx  (th) prior to that of th
protein. zns moderately inhibits monoamine oxydase (mao) b. it has no effects on dopamine receptors, dopamine
transporter or dopamine release. zns has no direct effects on glutamate receptors, adenosine receptors, or serotonergic
system, which have been suggested to be effective points of anti-pd drug other than dopamine system. therefore, it is
suggested that the activation of dopamine synthesis and the moderate level of  xxxg1358xxx  inhibition are main mechanisms of
zns effects on pd. zns has significant effects on t-type ca++ channels and oxidative stress. they may also affect the
beneficial action of zns on pd.

pharmacokine-

 xxxd3564xxx  (zns) (1, 2-benzisoxazole-3-methaesulfonamide) (fig. 1) is originally synthesized in japan [1]. it
has been used to treat intractable epilepsy (usual dosage;
300-600 mg/day) for over 10 years in japan and is now
available in the usa and south korea; awaiting approval in
europe. the exact mechanism of zns as an antiepileptic is
not completely understood. it blocks both voltage-dependent
na+ and t-type ca++ channels; thereby  xxxd3564xxx  is
suggested to limit the spread of seizures [2].

routes of elimination and a long half-life. oral absorption of
zns is complete and unaffected by food [3]. the time to
maximal plasma concentration (tmax) is about 3 hrs, which
is independent of the dosage [4]. the maximum concentration (cmax) in plasma increases dose dependently from
200-800 mg and ranged 2.3-12 µg/ml. the mean elimination
half-life ranged from 49.7-62.5 hours. at steady state, the
fluctuation between peak to trough zns concentrations was
14% (twice daily: 12-hour) and 27% (once-daily: 24-hour),
respectively [5]. the optimal dosage for most adult epileptic
patients is between 300-600 mg/day. this dose results in 10
to 30 µg/ml of serum level.

zns is distributed evenly throughout the entire body.
the concentrations in various tissues by [14c] zns study are
similar to the plasma concentrations, except for the liver,
kidney, and adrenal concentrations, which are approximately
twofold greater than the plasma concentrations. a
distribution study of zns in the rat brain model shows high
concentrations in the cerebral cortex and midbrain [6]. no
measurable accumulation of zns is found in the central
nervous system. brain uptake is not through a saturable,
carrier-mediated mechanism, but is attributable to lipidmediated transport system [7].
the main metabolites of zns in humans are the
glucuronide of the open-ring metabolite [2-(sulfamoylacetyl)-phenol-glucuronide] (smap) and the n-acetyl zns

(fig. 2). according to the in vitro human liver microsomal
studies, 3a group of cyp enzymes are responsible for the
formation of smap from zns [8]. at concentrations of 40
µg/ml (high end of the therapeutic concentration for
epilepsy), zns had less than 10% inhibitory effects on
several of the cyp isozymes, including cyp3a4 [9]. after a
single dose of [ 14c] zns in animal model, more than 80% of
the parent drug is eliminated in urine, with a minor fraction
eliminated in [3]. in humans, about 60% of the total dose
was recovered in urine as unchanged zns (35% of
recovery), n-acetyl zns (20%), and smap (50%) of the
total dose administered [10, 11]. zns kinetics were
unaffected by renal insufficiency, age, or the gender. the
serum concentrations were similar on once- or twice-daily
dosing [10].
 xxxd3564xxx  for parkinson's disease
short term effects (an open study)
we serendipitously found that zns has beneficial effects
on parkinson’s disease (pd) [12]. a 58-year-old man first
experienced right arm tremor about 10 years ago. although
levodopa had good effects on his symptoms, where, at first,
rigidity, akinesia, gait disturbance and postural instability
gradually worsened. in 1999, he needed help carrying out his
daily activities. in january 2000, he incidentally experienced
convulsion attacks and was given 300 mg/day zns. his
attacks were disappeared and surprisingly, his parkinsonian
symptoms also lessened (before zns; yahr stage iv.5, after
zns; iii.5). based on this finding, we carried out an open
trial of zns on 9 patients with pd. the mean age was 57.7
years, mean duration of the disease was 9.7 years and mean
disease severity was yahr stage (off time) 3.6. seven patients
showed motor fluctuation. fifty to two hundred mg/day zns
(once or twice daily) was given in addition to their previous
anti-pd drugs (levodopa, dopamine agonists, selegiline,
etc.). after 12 weeks of zns addition, their conditions were
assessed based on unified parkinson’s disease rating scale
(updrs). the cardinal symptoms of pd showed definite
amelioration, especially in the patients with motor

fluctuation. the beneficial effects of zns taken once a day
continued all day long, and motor fluctuation disappeared in
five patients. the updrs part ii (activities of daily living)
of “off” time, updrs part iii (motor examination), yahr
stage of “off” time and duration of “off” time were significantly improved (fig. 3). the effects appeared within 3-7
days after zns addition. two patients, whose responses to
levodopa were poor from the first stage of their disease, had
poor responses to zns. adverse effects noted were the dry
mouth (n=1) and exaggeration of dyskinesia (n=4). the
dyskinesia was decreased by reducing levodopa dose.
long-term effects
we estimated the long term effects of zns up to 3 years.
improvement rate of updrs total score is more than 40% at
3 months and was maintained for more than 1 year. after 1.5
year updrs score gradually decreased, but at 3 years it was
maintained over 30% in advanced pd patients [13].
double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study
in japan, we carried out a multicenter, double-blind,
randomized, placebo- controlled study of zns as an add on
drug in patients with pd (unpublished data). the study
showed that small dose of zns (50-100 mg/day) significantly improved parkinsonian symptoms in advanced
patients. zns improved not only limb rigidity and tremor but
also axial symptoms such as postural instability. the
frequency of adverse events of 50-100 mg/day administered
group was equal to that of the placebo group. this study
shows that zns is a new, effective, and a safe antiparkinsonian drug.
mechanism of action
as an anti-epileptic agent
the exact mechanism of zns as an antiepileptic is not
completely understood. multiple mechanisms of action have
been proposed for zns [14]. the main mechanisms were

attributed to neuronal sodium channels, t-type voltagedependent calcium channels, and synaptic transmission. as
to sodium channel, zns has no effects on its activation, but
produces a shift in its steady-state fast inactivation curve to
more negative voltages and slows its recovery both from fast
and slow inactivations [2]. effects of zns on fast inactivation occurred at relatively low concentrations (1-100 µm),
with half-maximal concentration of 12 µm producing a 20
mv shift in the steady-state inactivation to slow recovery
curve. the effect of zns from slow inactivation occurred at
even lower concentrations (0.1-10 µm). in the presence of
therapeutic level of zns, there was a concentration-dependent reduction in sustained repetitive firing (ic50= 17 µm).

m. murata

the presynaptic release of glutamate. however, whether there
is a direct action of zns on the release or an indirect action
on voltage-gated sodium or calcium channels is unclear [15].
zns has been suggested to alter monoamine neurotransmission [2] (see below). the relationship between the effects
of zns as an anti-epileptic drug and as an anti- parkinsonian
drug is unclear.
as an anti-parkinsonian drug
according to the clinical trials, the effect of zns on pd
is similar to a long-acting levodopa, since it reinforces and
prolongs the levodopa effects. therefore, it is important to
know whether zns affects on the dopamine system.

zns does not alter high-threshold calcium currents [15]
but reduces low- threshold t-type calcium currents in
cultured fetal rat cortical neurons in a concentrationdependent manner [16]. the reduction in t current was 1025% at therapeutic concentration of zns (10-50 µm) in
cultured fetal rat cortical neurons. in cultured human
neuroblastoma cells, zns reduced t current by 38% at 50
µm and shifted the inactivation curve to more negative
potentials by 20 mv [17].

as for anti-parkinsonian drugs, the likely therapeutic
interventions can be detected also toward the cholinergic
system (anti-cholinergics; trihexyphenidyl), the glutamatergic system (nmda antagonist; amantadine), the adenosine
receptors (adenosine a2 blocker) and the serotonergic
system. therefore i will discuss zns effects on these
systems after dopamine system.

zns has been reported to alter neurotransmitter levels
and its metabolism and to modify neurotransmitter receptor
function. although a number of anticonvulsant drugs have
been demonstrated to enhance gabaa receptor function
[18], zns has no direct effects on modifying gabaa
receptor currents [15]. as for glutamatergic system, zns
may inhibit glutamatergic synaptic transmission by reducing

single administration of zns (20 and 50 mg/kg)
increased intracellular and extracellular dopa, dopamine,
and hva levels, and decreased dopac (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid) level [19, 20]. long-term administration
of zns also increased intracellular, and extracellular dopa
and dopamine. as to dopac and hva, there were two
reports; one reported increase in dopac and hva [19] and

novel therapeutic effects of the anti-convulsant

the other reported no change [22]. okada et al. suggested
that zns increases dopamine synthesis since zns increases
intra-cellular and extracellular dopa levels even after the
central  xxxg618xxx  (aromatic amino acid decarboxylase)
inhibitor; nsd 1015 administration [19]. therapeutic doses
of zns enhanced dopamine function while a supratherapeutic dose (100 mg/kg) decreased dopamine function.
therefore, it is conceivable that zns has biphasic effects on
dopamine function which depends upon the zns dose.
we showed that long-term administration of zns (20, 50
mg/kg, 14 days) increased the activity and protein levels of
 xxxg2276xxx  (th) in rat striatum. furthermore, we
also showed that the levels of th mrna increased prior to
the increase in th protein levels in sh-sy5y cells. these
data suggest that zns activates dopamine synthesis by
increasing th mrna. the protein level of dopa
decarboxylase (ddc) was not affected by zns (unpublished
data). chronic administration of zns had no effects on the
levels of biopterine and neopterine (coenzymes of th) (prof.
ichinose, personal communication).
as to zns effects on the degradation enzymes of the
dopaminergic system, it was reported that zns weakly
inhibited monoamine oxydase b ( xxxg1358xxx ) activity using
liver microsomal fraction (ic50: 600 µm) [20]. however,
when striatal membrane fraction was used, ic50 was 28 µm
(unpublished data). it is conceivable that  xxxg1358xxx  inhibition is
a part of a mechanism of zns effects on pd because the
therapeutic dose of zns in the brain is thought to be 10-50
µm for pd. zns has no effects on cathecol-o-methyltransferase (comt) (dainippon pharm. co).
single administration of zns had no effects on calciumdependent (n-type ca++ channel) dopamine release [19] or
dopamine re-uptake in rat striatum [20]. zns had no affinity
for the  xxxg2149xxx  [21]. zns (10 nm-100 µm) had
no affinities also for d1 and d2 dopamine receptors of rat
striatum membrane fraction when using 2 nm [3h]
sch23390 and 0.5 nm [3h] spiperone respectively for the
ligand (unpublished data). one hundred µm of zns had no
affinity for d3, d4 (d4.2, d4.4 d4.7) or d5 dopamine
receptors (dainippon pharm. co).
(b) serotonin system
as to the serotonin system, there are conflicting data.
okada et al. reported zns has biphasic effects on
serotonergic system, with therapeutic doses enhancing and
supra- therapeutic doses decreasing 5-ht (serotonin; 5hydroxytryptamine), 5-htp (5-hydroxytryptophan), and 5hiaa (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid)[23]. our data showed
that the therapeutic dose of zns had no effects on the levels
of 5ht or 5hiaa. zns had no affinity for 5ht1,2,3,4,
5a,6,7 receptors (dainippon pharm. co).
(c) cholinergic system
zns (20 mg/kg) increased acetylcholine (ach) release
and metabolism, without affecting acetylcholinesterase
activities [24].
(d) other receptors
zns has no affinity for glutamate (nmda, ampa, or
kainate) receptors or adenosine (a1, a2a, a2b) receptors of
rat brain (dainippon pharm. co).

current pharmaceutical design, 2004, vol. 10, no. 6 691

according to these data, we suggest that the main effects
of zns on parkinson’s disease are; activation of dopamine
synthesis and moderate level of  xxxg1358xxx  inhibition. until
now, zns has no direct effects on dopamine release or
reuptake, as well as comt activities. furthermore, zns has
no direct effects on glutamate receptors, adenosine receptor,
or serotonin receptors which are concerned targets of antiparkinsonian drugs other than the dopamine system.
how does  xxxd3564xxx  increase  xxxg2276xxx 
mrna?
zns activates dopamine synthesis through the increase
of th mrna levels prior to the increase of th protein
levels. there are two possible explanations. one is that zns
regulates transcription of the th gene. it was reported that
 xxxd3485xxx  increased th mrna levels in rat locus
ceruleus through  xxxg1222xxx  (ap-1)[25], and nicotine
also increased th mrna levels by increasing the cyclic
amp-responsive element (cre) –binding activity [26, 27].
since many other transcription factors are reported to
regulate th gene expression [28], it is needed to clarify
whether zns regulates the transcription of th gene. the
other possibility is that zns directly activates dopaminergic
neurons via t-type ca++ channels. zns is a specific t-type
ca++ channel blocker. worfart & roeper recently reported
that the inhibition of t-type ca++ channel increases burst
firing of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (sn)
[29]. t-type ca++ currents are translated into smallconductance calcium-activated potassium (sk) currents by
their functional coupling in sn dopamine neurons.  xxxg1266xxx 
channel (apamine- sensitive) controls pacemaker frequency
and precision in sn dopamine neurons, but not in a
subpopulation of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental
area [30].  xxxg1266xxx  channels are activated selectively via t-type
ca++ channels in sn dopamine neurons. therefore th
mrna may be increased as a result of increasing dopamine
consumption caused by the burst firing (fig. 5).
physiological investigation is now under way to clarify
whether zns increases th mrna via t-type ca++ channels.
estrogen is reported to activate dopamine activity in the
nigrostriatal system [31]. interestingly, estrogen enhances
the efficacy of  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenergic receptor agonists to inhibit
apamin-sensitive  xxxg1266xxx  currents [32]. it is possible that both
zns and estrogen may activate nigrostriatal dopamine
system via blocking  xxxg1266xxx  channels.
neuroprotective effects
it is reported that zns may have neuroprotective effects
[33]. zns reduced ischemic damage to the ca1 sector of the
hippocampus in a gerbil model of transient global forebrain
ischemia [34, 35]. it almost completely prevented the
elevation of glutamate release in the hippocampus during
and following ischemia [35]. in the rat model of transient
focal ischemia with reperfusion, zns reduced infarct volume
and neurological deficits [36]. it is suggested that the
mechanism of antiepileptic effect of zns may involve
protection of neurons from free radical damage and
stabilization of neuronal membranes [37]. actually zns
scavenges hydroxyl radicals (oh•) and  xxxd2738xxx  (no)
[37], and has reducing properties [38]. it inhibits lipid

fig. (5). zns may activate th synthesis via t-type ca++ channel. zns inhibits t-type ca++ channel which is linked sk channel. zns
may increase burst firing of nigral dopamine neurons as nicl2 and apamin, and may increase th mrna as a result of increasing dopamine
consumption caused by the activated burst firings.

peroxidation in iron-induced epileptic foci of rats [39], nitric
synthase (nos) activity [40], and formation of 8-hydroxy2’-deoxyguanosine (8-ohdg) a marker for oxidative dna
damage [41]. these evidences suggest that zns may protect
neurons from oxidative stress.
oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis
of pd [42]. postmortem analysis showed increased levels of
iron, decreased complex i activity, and a decrease in already
 xxxd2213xxx  (gsh) levels in pd brain [43]. although
it is not clear whether the oxidant stress found in the sn in
pd is the primary or secondary insult, oxidative damage
occurs in the brain in pd. many reports about antioxidative
effects of zns suggest that zns has potential
neuroprotective effects on pd. as for this point, masuda, et
al. reported that zns exerted a potent preventive effect on
mptp-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration in a dosedependent manner [44]. in this study, zns was administered
before mptp administration. since zns moderately inhibits
activity of mao b which in turn metabolize mptp to mpp +,
a toxic substance, it is possible that zns may play a major
role by inhibiting mpp+ synthesis. therefore, whether this
report may support the hypothesis that zns has
neuroprotective effects in human sporadic pd is unclear.
further investigations are needed to clarify the
neuroprotective effects of zns on parkinson’s disease.
