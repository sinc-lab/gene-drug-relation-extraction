thrombus formation during acute coronary syndromes and/or percutaneous coronary
intervention. while there are several intravenous gp iib/iiia inhibitors available,  xxxd53xxx  has
proven to be a dependable agent with unique properties. based on american college of
cardiology, american heart association and society for angiography and interventions
guidelines, compared with the other available intravenous gp iib/iiia inhibitors,  xxxd53xxx 
receives the highest recommendation for use in patients with st-elevation myocardial infarction
undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention.  xxxd53xxx  is also unique in that there
is no need for renal dosing and its effects are mostly reversible with platelet transfusions.

angioplasty, as described by dotter and judkins
in 1964, is the enlargement of the lumen of a
stenotic vessel by a catheter-based technique [1].
the days of spring coils and progressively enlarging rigid dilators have long since passed. advances
in endovascular techniques over the last 40 years
have generated an explosive era of technology.
dotter’s peripheral arterial work laid the framework for the initial coronary balloon dilations by
gruentzig and colleagues [2], leading to the
advent of bare metal stents, the evolution of drugeluting stents and, ultimately, to the futuristic
bioabsorbable stents.
while the rapid evolution of equipment in
interventional cardiology has been palpable,
imperative advances of adjunctive pharmacotherapy in the cardiac catheterization laboratory have
been just as liberating. since gruentzig’s first
angioplasty in 1977, unfractionated heparin
(ufh) has been the foundation anticoagulant, as
it was recognized that thrombus formation in the
target vessel led to ischemic events [3]. the
development of stents escalated the necessity for
adequate anticoagulation that often included
some combination of pretreatment with aspirin,
dextran, intraprocedural high-dose ufh and oral
anticoagulation therapy – the latter continued for
up to 3 months postprocedure [4–6].
over the past two decades, increased understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms

and thrombus formation have led to significant
improvements in the outcomes of patients
undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention
(pci). the integrity of the coronary artery
endothelium is compromised via the disruption
of an unstable plaque or by the deployment of a
balloon (and/or a stent), which leads to a prothrombotic cascade of platelet adhesion, activation and aggregation, ultimately leading to
intraluminal thrombus formation and myocardial ischemia (or necrosis). the thrombotic cascade responsible for these events involves complex signaling pathways between platelets and
other coagulation factors (figure 1). in select
patient populations undergoing pci, treatment
with glycoprotein (gp) iib/iiia inhibitors, in
conjunction with ufh and aspirin, significantly reduces the composite end point of
death, myocardial infarction (mi) or the additional need for coronary revascularization during the index hospitalization, at 30-day and
6-month follow-up [7].
overview of gp iib/iiia
receptor inhibitors

in 1985, coller unveiled the first direct evidence
that platelet activation results in a change in the
gp iib/iiia complex [8]. it was later described
that following platelet activation, the gp iib/iiia
receptor undergoes a conformational change

rendering it competent to bind proteins (particularly fibrinogen),
allowing a bridge to be formed between two adjacent platelets [9].
this is the final common pathway in platelet aggregation, thus
exposing the gp iib/iiia receptor as a target for prevention of
thrombus formation during acute coronary syndromes or pci.

and clinicians do not favor the drug for this
patient population. the controlled  xxxd53xxx  and device investigation to lower
late angioplasty complications (cadillac) investigators published a cost–effectiveness substudy suggesting that, compared with standard anticoagulation
treatment,  xxxd53xxx  increased initial procedural costs by us$1122 (p < 0.001), but
reduced length of stay by approximately
0.6 days, offsetting the majority of the cost
differential [18]. mccollam et al. published
nonrandomized, retrospective data evaluating 32,529 patients with acute mi, which
demonstrated that treatment with  xxxd53xxx  was associated with favorable differences in survival, incremental cost–effectiveness and length of stay when compared
with  xxxd3385xxx  and  xxxd2017xxx  [19].

 xxxd53xxx  pharmacokinetics & pharmacodynamics

the three intravenous gp iib/iiia inhibitors currently available
for clinical use are  xxxd53xxx ,  xxxd2017xxx  and  xxxd3385xxx . according to the 2007 american college of cardiology (acc), american heart association (aha) and society for angiography and
interventions (scai) practice guideline update for pci, intravenous gp iib/iiia receptor inhibitors are useful in unstable
angina (ua)/non-st elevation mi (nstemi) patients undergoing pci (class i, level of evidence a) [10], with no differentiation among the three available agents. however,  xxxd53xxx 
receives a stronger recommendation for primary pci in stemi
(class iia, level of evidence b vs class iib, level of evidence c)
based primarily on data derived from the  xxxd53xxx  before
direct angioplasty and stenting in myocardial infarction
regarding acute and long-term follow-up (admiral) and
 xxxd53xxx  and carbostent evaluation (ace) trials [12–16].
while multiple individual trials have demonstrated that gp
iib/iiia inhibitors decrease ischemic end points after coronary
angioplasty, a meta-analysis involving 19 trials of 20,137
patients was required to prove that overall 30-day and 6-month
mortality was reduced significantly [17].

the first-generation gp iib/iiia inhibitor was a murine monoclonal antibody [20]; however, there was significant concern for
antigenicity of the fc fragment and subsequent generations contained only the fab-binding fragment of the immunoglobulin [21].
 xxxd53xxx  is an intravenous, chimeric monoclonal antibody
fab fragment (initially named  xxxd53xxx  fab) that inhibits platelet
aggregation by preventing the binding of fibrinogen,  xxxg2423xxx  and other adhesive molecules to the gp iib/iiia
receptor sites on activated platelets. administration of a singlebolus dose in humans (0.25 mg/kg) followed by a continuous
infusion (10 µg/min) for periods of 12–96 h produces a sustained, high-grade gp iib/iiia receptor blockade (≥80%) inhibition of platelet function for the duration of the infusion in
most patients.
following intravenous bolus administration, free plasma concentrations decrease rapidly with an initial half-life of less than 10
min and a second phase half-life of approximately 30 min.
within 2 h, 80% of the platelet gp iib/iiia receptors are occupied and platelet aggregation is completely inhibited.  xxxd53xxx 
binds noncompetitively to the gp iib/iiia receptor with very
high affinity; however, in the absence of an intravenous infusion,
drug concentrations decline slowly with an extended terminal
disposition phase (half-life ∼ 7 h) [22]. blockade of the gp
iib/iiia receptors occurs at low levels for over 10 days after the
infusion has been discontinued, even though the overall function
of the platelets returns to normal during the first 48 h [23].

 xxxd53xxx : a review & update for clinicians

ischemic complications (epic) trial evaluated patients undergoing high-risk angioplasty and concluded that the addition of
 xxxd53xxx  bolus plus infusion to standard-dose ufh decreased
all ischemic end points; however, bleeding complications were
increased twofold in the treatment group [24]. most of the bleeding episodes occurred during coronary artery bypass grafting or
at the arteriotomy site. similarly, bleeding was more common in
the treatment arm of the  xxxd53xxx  fab anti platelet therapy in
unstable refractory angina (capture) trial, which evaluated
patients with refractory ua and compared heparin–placebo with
heparin– xxxd53xxx  administration from 16–24 h preceeding
coronary intervention through 1 h postintervention [25]. the
excess bleeding issue with  xxxd53xxx  led to the evaluation in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (ptca) to
improve long-term outcome with  xxxd53xxx  gp iib/iiia
blockade (epilog) trial in which weight-adjusted ufh dosing
and a protocol for vascular access sheath removal were utilized.
the alterations significantly limited bleeding in the treatment
group, yet there was a continued reduction in the risk of ischemic
complications [26].
thrombocytopenia is commonly linked to gp iib/iiia inhibitors and seems to be more common with  xxxd53xxx  when compared with  xxxd2017xxx  or  xxxd3385xxx  [27,28]. in a substudy from
the do  xxxd3385xxx  and reopro give similar efficacy outcomes
(target) trial, patients with thrombocytopenia had an
increase in severe bleeding (5.1 vs 0.7%; p = 0.001), more frequent blood transfusions (6.1 vs 1.4%; p = 0.001), and at
30-day follow-up an increase in death (2 vs 0.4%; p = 0.022)
and target vessel revascularization (6.07 vs 0.6%, p < 0.001) [29].
thrombocytopenia secondary to  xxxd53xxx  typically occurs
within 24 h of administration but can also occur within the first
30 min of administration. the overall incidence is 2.5–6% for
mild thrombocytopenia (<100,000 µg/l), 0.4–1.6% for severe
thrombocytopenia (<50,000 µg/l) and approximately 0.001% for
profound thrombocytopenia (<20,000 µg/l) [30,31]. several case
reports have described delayed thrombocytopenia after treatment
with  xxxd53xxx , occurring 4–7 days after therapy [32–34]. the exact
incidence of this phenomenon is unknown as the vast majority of
patients are discharged before the potential occurrence, but
further investigation on a larger scale may be warranted.
despite the removal of the fc portion, it was originally
thought that  xxxd53xxx  would potentially act as an antigen upon
readministration, thereby inducing an immune response and
subsequent drop in platelet count. the results of the reopro
readministration registry concluded that the risk for developing any thrombocytopenia after the readministration of the drug
was no different from the risk during primary exposure (23 out
of 499; 4.6%) [14]. however, it did appear that the severity of
thrombocytopenia upon re-exposure to  xxxd53xxx  was greater in
patients who experienced any degree of thrombocytopenia with
the index exposure (>50% with platelet count <20,000 µg/l).
pseudothrombocytopenia, occasionally seen with gp iib/iiia
inhibitors, refers to a laboratory artifact due to platelet clumping that is induced by the anticoagulant present in the tube

(edta) in which the blood sample is drawn (figure 2) [35]. this
can be ruled out by repeating the platelet count in sodium citrate (or ufh) or by examination of a blood smear to rule out
platelet clumping. the overall incidence of pseudothrombocytopenia is low (2%), but this accounts for 36% of cases of
thrombocytopenia secondary to  xxxd53xxx  therapy [36].
owing to the aforementioned issues, it is reasonable to
check a platelet count prior to the invasive procedure and 2–4
h after the  xxxd53xxx  bolus [37]. after pseudothrombocytopenia has been ruled out, cessation of  xxxd53xxx  should be considered for platelet counts less than 100,000 µg/l (or a 50%
decrease in overall platelet count) and platelet transfusions are
recommended if the platelet count is less than 10,000 µg/l or if
the patient is actively bleeding [38]. multiple studies suggest
that platelet transfusions are associated with a rapid and sustained increase in platelet count suggesting that abciximabinduced thrombocytopenia is a transient reaction that clears
with platelet transfusion as the new, functional platelets
replace the  xxxd53xxx  bound platelets [14,39,40].
clinical trials in stemi

within the first few days after percutaneous reperfusion in
stemi, most of the recurrent acute events are secondary to
reocclusion of the infarct-related artery due to marked platelet
activation with increased surface expression of the gp iib/iiia
receptor [41]. in the days of primary balloon angioplasty for
stemi, there was a 5–15% rate of in-hospital major ischemic
complications and subsequent repeat revascularization in 35%
of patients [15,42–47].
in the reopro and primary ptca organization and randomized trial (rapport), investigators hypothesized that
platelet gp iib/iiia receptor blockade with  xxxd53xxx

would reduce both acute ischemic events and late restenosis
in patients undergoing primary ptca. they studied 483
patients and found that aggressive platelet inhibition with
 xxxd53xxx  yielded a substantial reduction in the death, reinfarction and urgent target vessel revascularization at 30 days.
however, the bleeding rates were excessive and the 6-month
primary end point, which included elective revascularization, was not favorably affected [41]. shortly thereafter, the
intracoronary stenting and antithrombotic regimen-2 trial
(isar-2) investigated the effect of  xxxd53xxx  on angiographic and clinical restenosis after stenting following acute
mi. patients received standard-dose ufh versus low-dose
ufh and  xxxd53xxx  with a 30-day composite clinical end
point of death, reinfarction and target-lesion revascularization. the treatment arm substantially reduced the 30-day
event rate, but at 1-year follow-up, there was no additional
benefit in target-lesion revascularization or angiographic
restenosis [16].
one of the landmark trials for use of  xxxd53xxx  in stemi
was published in 2001 by montalescot et al. in the admiral trial, 300 patients with acute mi underwent doubleblind randomization to  xxxd53xxx  plus stenting versus placebo plus stenting before undergoing coronary angiography.
the 30-day primary composite end point of death, reinfarction or urgent target-vessel revascularization, occurred in 6%
of the treatment group compared with 14.6% of the placebo
group (p = 0.01). this benefit continued to be significant at
6-months with no significant bleeding difference [12]. interestingly, better outcomes with  xxxd53xxx  were related to the
greater frequency of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction
(timi) grade 3 flow before the procedure, immediately after
and at 6-month follow-up.
the cadillac study enrolled 2082 patients (88% with
stemi) undergoing primary ptca alone, ptca plus  xxxd53xxx , primary stenting or primary stenting plus  xxxd53xxx  [48].
at 6 months, the composite end point of death, reinfarction,
disabling stroke and ischemia-driven target-vessel revascularization was significantly lower with the use of stenting, independent of  xxxd53xxx  administration. these data ultimately led to
the conclusion that stent implantation (with or without  xxxd53xxx ) should be considered the routine reperfusion strategy in
stemi. this position was further supported by the ace trial,
which demonstrated a reduction in the primary end point of
death, reinfarction, target-vessel revascularization or stroke at
30 days in the stent plus  xxxd53xxx  group (4.5 vs 10.5%; p =
0.023) driven primarily by a reduction in the incidence of reinfarction [13]. however, 6-month repeat target vessel revascularization and restenosis rates were similar between the two groups,
with the composite of death and reinfarction lower in the
 xxxd53xxx  group.
a summary of all completed, published, randomized trials
of  xxxd53xxx  in stemi was published in 2005 by deluca
et al. [49]. overall, 11 trials were analyzed, involving 27,115
patients, including 12,602 in the  xxxd53xxx  group and

612

14,513 in the control group, utilizing both primary pci and
primary thrombolytic therapy.  xxxd53xxx  use was associated
with a reduction in short-term (30-day) mortality (2.4 vs
3.4%; p = 0.047) and long-term (6–12 months) mortality
(4.4 vs 6.2%; p = 0.01) in patients undergoing primary pci,
as well as a significant reduction in 30-day reinfarction (1.0
vs 1.9%; p = 0.03; figure 3). there was no increase in intracranial bleeding or major bleeding with primary pci and
 xxxd53xxx  versus primary angioplasty and placebo. there
was no benefit of  xxxd53xxx  on mortality in patients treated
with thrombolysis.
the 2004 acc/aha stemi guidelines give  xxxd53xxx  a
class iia indication, stating that it should be given as early as
possible before primary pci (with or without stenting) in
patients with stemi (level of evidence: b) [50] while  xxxd3385xxx 
and  xxxd2017xxx  received a class iib indication (table 1). the
recently published 2007 focused update of the 2004
acc/aha stemi guidelines does not mention any alteration
in this recommendation.
clinical trials in facilitated pci
& facilitated thrombolysis

in patients with stemi, it was hypothesized that pharmacologic improvement in rates of timi 3 flow could be achieved
by the combination of platelet disaggregation (via iib/iiia
receptor inhibition) and fibrinolysis (via fibrinolytic therapy)
[51]. in the timi-14 trial, 888 patients with stemi were randomized to either 100 mg of accelerated-dose  xxxg1766xxx  versus
 xxxd53xxx  alone versus a combination of the two with reduced
doses of  xxxg1766xxx  or streptokinase. all patients in the  xxxd53xxx 
arms received low-dose ufh (compared with weight-adjusted
ufh; figure 4) [52].

repeat percutaneous procedure or stenting, or insertion of an
intra-aortic balloon pump for refractory ischemia [24]. the
administration of bolus and continuous infusion of  xxxd53xxx 
reduced the occurrence of the primary end point by 35% at
30 days (12.8 vs 8.3%; p = 0.0008), by 23% at 6 months and by
13% at 3 years [28,58,59]. this was largely driven by the reduction
in the need for repeat revascularization (bypass surgery or pci) in
patients with an initially successful procedure. of note, the
administration of  xxxd53xxx  in this trial was associated with an
increased bleeding risk and transfusion requirement.
in the ensuing ua trial epilog,  xxxd53xxx  plus standarddose, weight-adjusted ufh (100 u/kg bolus) was compared with
 xxxd53xxx  with low-dose, weight-adjusted ufh (70 u/kg bolus)
and placebo with standard-dose, weight-adjusted ufh [26]. the
trial was terminated early because at 30 days, the composite event
rate (death from any cause, mi or urgent revascularization) was
11.7% in the group with ufh, only 5.2% in the group with
 xxxd53xxx  and low-dose ufh (p < 0.001) and 5.4% in the group
assigned to  xxxd53xxx  with standard-dose ufh (p < 0.001).
minor bleeding was more frequent among the patients receiving
 xxxd53xxx  with standard-dose ufh, but there was no significant
difference among the groups in the risk of major bleeding.
the value of upstream  xxxd53xxx  was assessed in the capture trial in which  xxxd53xxx  was given 18–24 h before
ptca to assess if it could improve outcomes in patients with
nstemi. at 30-day follow-up, patients receiving  xxxd53xxx 
(versus placebo infusion) had a 30% reduction in the composite primary end point of death, mi or urgent (re)intervention
(10.8 vs 15.4%; p = 0.017) [60]. it was also observed that more
frequent thrombus resolution and a higher angiographic success rate occurred in patients treated with  xxxd53xxx  before and
during angioplasty compared with placebo.
interestingly, in the gusto-iv trial, there was no benefit to
 xxxd53xxx  bolus and drip infusion in ua/nstemi patients who
did not undergo subsequent revascularization [61]. the primary end
point of death or mi at 30 days was the same for patients who were

plus 48-h infusion, or placebo (8.2 and 9.1 vs 8.0% for placebo).
overall bleeding rates were low, but increased with  xxxd53xxx , particularly when continued for 48 h (p < 0.05 compared with placebo). the 2007 acc/aha ua/nstemi revised guidelines
have indicated that  xxxd53xxx  therapy should not be administered
to patients in whom pci is not planned (class iii, level of evidence a); however, it is reasonable to add  xxxd2017xxx  or  xxxd3385xxx 
to oral antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy in the same patient
population (class iib, level of evidence b) (table 1) [62].
finally, in the recently published intracoronary stenting and
antithrombotic regimen–rapid early action for coronary
treatment (isar–react) 2 trial, in patients with an elevated
troponin undergoing pci who were preloaded with 600 mg of
plavix,  xxxd53xxx  significantly reduced the risk of ischemic end
points when compared with patients receiving placebo [63].
clinical trials in elective procedures

the evaluation of platelet iib/iiia inhibitor for stenting (epistent) trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of  xxxd53xxx  as
an adjunct to elective (or emergent) coronary stenting [64].
patients (n = 2399) were randomly assigned to therapy with stenting alone, stenting plus  xxxd53xxx , or ptca plus  xxxd53xxx . the
adjunctive use of  xxxd53xxx  was associated with a significant
reduction in the 30-day composite clinical end point of death, mi
or urgent revascularization, occurring in 10.8% of the stent plus
placebo group, 5.3% of the stent plus  xxxd53xxx  group and 6.9%
of the ptca plus  xxxd53xxx  group. this benefit was driven primarily by a reduction in the incidence of moderate-to-large mis.
follow-up at 6 months indicated continued benefit with  xxxd53xxx  as the incidence of death or mi was 11.4% in the group that
received a stent and placebo, compared with 5.6% in the group
that received a stent and  xxxd53xxx  (p < 0.001) and 7.8% in the
group assigned to ptca and  xxxd53xxx  (p = 0.01). repeat revascularization tended towards improvement in the stent plus  xxxd53xxx  group versus stent and placebo but was not statistically significant. evidence from the evaluation of reopro® and stenting
to eliminate restenosis (eraser) trial suggests that  xxxd53xxx 
infusion for 12–24 h after angioplasty does not reduce in-stent
restenosis by quantitative coronary angiography [65].
for low-to-intermediate risk elective stenting procedures, the
isar–react trial demonstrated that  xxxd53xxx  may not provide any additional benefit if the patient is pretreated with clopidogrel [66]. all patients (n = 2159) were pretreated with a 600-mg
dose of clopidogrel at least 2 h before the procedure, and were
then randomly assigned to receive  xxxd53xxx  plus ufh (70
u/kg) or placebo plus ufh (100–140 u/kg). at 30 days postrandomization, there was no significant difference in the primary
end point of death, mi or urgent target vessel revascularization.
there was no significant difference in bleeding complications;
however, profound thrombocytopenia occurred in ten patients
(1%) in the  xxxd53xxx  group and none in the placebo group
(p = 0.002). a follow-up study, intracoronary stenting and
anti-thrombotic regimen: is  xxxd53xxx  a superior way to

eliminate elevated thrombotic risk in diabetics (isarsweet) did not support a significant impact of  xxxd53xxx  on
the risk of death and mi in diabetic patients undergoing pci after
pretreatment with a 600-mg loading dose of clopidogrel, but did
suggest  xxxd53xxx  may reduce the risk of bare metal stent
in-stent-restenosis in this patient population [67].
the 2005 acc/aha/scai updated practice guidelines for
pci assigns a class iia recommendation for the use of gp
iib/iiia receptor antagonists for pci as it can be beneficial in
facilitating earlier platelet inhibition, more so than if the
patient is on clopidogrel alone [50].

expert commentary

the gp iib/iiia complex is a crucial membrane receptor for platelet aggregation, binding platelets to fibrinogen and establishing
interplatelet bridges. this receptor is the common end point for
multiple activation pathways of the platelet. antiplatelet agents,
such as aspirin and clopidogrel, inhibit one or more of these activation pathways, but do not affect the gp iib/iiia receptor. the
platelet gp iib/iiia inhibitors differ in their pharmacokinetics,
pharmacodynamics and differential receptor affinities. the affinity
of  xxxd53xxx  for the platelet gp iib/iiia integrin receptor, together
with nonplatelet mediated effects, most likely contributes to the
clinical benefit associated with its use as adjunctive pharmacotherapy during pci. as newer anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents
evolve, the role of gp iib/iiia inhibition will need to be redefined
in combination with these newer agents.

five-year view

as we embark upon a new era in interventional cardiology
including the development of bifurcating stents, bioabsorbable
stents, and probably gene therapy, the landscape of adjunctive
pharmacotherapy will continue to evolve in order to maximize
the efficacy of these developments. just as coller pioneered an
entire field of research and technology with the discovery of the
importance of the iib/iiia receptor, another investigator will
discover the key to the next step in advancing the field of
adjunctive pharmacotherapy. the integration of direct
thrombin inhibitors for pci has already surfaced, and the
development of  xxxg1645xxx  platelet receptor antagonists (such as
 xxxd423xxx  and  xxxd3373xxx ) have shown significant promise [68].
nonetheless, for the foreseeable future,  xxxd53xxx  will portend favor to the patient with renal insufficiency, require consideration for the patient with bleeding diathesis and be
standard of care for the patient with stemi.

key issues
•  xxxd53xxx  is the standard of care for patients with st elevation myocardial infarction (stemi) undergoing primary percutaneous
coronary intervention, as it is the only glycoprotein (gp) iib/iiia inhibitor that receives a class iia indication in the american college of
cardiology/american heart association guidelines (integrilin and  xxxd3385xxx  are class iib).
•  xxxd53xxx  is the only gp iib/iiia inhibitor that is partially reversible to platelet transfusion and may be preferable in any patient at high
risk for a bleeding complication or a coronary perforation. (it is important to note that patients with bleeding diathesis or significant
bleeding risk were uniformly excluded from clinical trials of all gp inhibitors.)
• within 2 h of  xxxd53xxx  bolus, 80% of the platelet gp iib/iiia receptors are occupied and platelet aggregation is completely inhibited.
• typically within 24 h of  xxxd53xxx  administration, mild thrombocytopenia (<100,000 µg/l) occurs in 2.5–6% of patients, severe
thrombocytopenia (<50,000 µg/l) in 0.4–1.6% and profound thrombocytopenia (<20,000 µg/l) in approximately 0.001%.
