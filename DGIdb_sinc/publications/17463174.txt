real-time pcr determination of  xxxg1186xxx  and
 xxxg1187xxx  expression in blood cells
sara bremer,1,2 helge rootwelt,1,2 and stein bergan*1,2
background:  xxxd557xxx  dehydrogenase
(impdh) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in de novo
guanine nucleotide synthesis and is implicated in cell
cycle control. inhibition of this enzyme is associated
with immunosuppressive, antiviral, and antitumor activity. impdh basal activity increases after initiation of
immunosuppressive therapy.
methods: a real-time reverse-transcription pcr assay
was developed and validated for mrna quantification
of the 2 human impdh isoforms. target gene expressions were normalized to the geometric mean of 3
housekeeping genes. assay utility was tested by analyzing patient samples and cultured cells exposed to immunosuppressive drugs such as the impdh inhibitor
 xxxd2678xxx .
results: the assay was linear over 6 logs of cdna input
and demonstrated specific quantification of  xxxg1186xxx 
and  xxxg1187xxx  expression in cultured cells and patient
samples. limits of detection and quantification were 10
and 103 copies of cdna per reaction, respectively.
within-run and total between-day cvs were <15% for
normalized expression. changes in  xxxg1186xxx  and 2 expression were observed in patient samples after initiation of an immunosuppressive regimen that included
calcineurin inhibitors,  xxxd2677xxx , and
steroids.
conclusions: this assay can be used to study the
regulation of impdh expression and the involvement of
the enzymes in immunological and malignant proliferative conditions. this may contribute to the processes of
drug development and to the establishment of monitor-

ing strategies for treatment effect and disease activity.

 xxxd557xxx  dehydrogenase (impdh)3 is the
rate-limiting enzyme in de novo synthesis of guanine
nucleotides. two closely related human impdh isoforms,
types 1 and 2, have been identified, each consisting of 514
amino acids with 84% sequence identity (1 ). the isoforms
are encoded by 2 distinct genes,  xxxg1186xxx  and impdh24
( xxxg1186xxx  and 2), located
at 7q31.3– q32 and 3p21.2–p24.2, respectively (2, 3 ). gene
expression of the 2 isoforms is differently regulated in
various tissues and cell populations, and they are not
mutually redundant (4, 5 ). inhibitors of impdh lead to
depletion of guanine nucleotide pools, resulting in various immunosuppressive, antiviral, and antitumor effects.
proliferating lymphocytes are particularly sensitive to
impdh inhibition owing to their strong dependency on
de novo guanine nucleotide synthesis (6 ). mycophenolic
acid (mpa), a noncompetitive inhibitor of impdh, is
included in immunosuppressive drug regimens to prevent graft rejection after organ transplantation (7 ).
studies in yeast and human cell lines indicate impdh
gene expression feedback regulation by guanine nucleotides (8, 9 ). baseline impdh enzyme activity is upregulated in erythrocytes and whole blood after transplantation and initiation of immunosuppressive therapy (10 –
12 ). methods for  xxxg1186xxx  and 2 mrna quantification
rely mainly on northern blotting assays. real-time reverse transcription (rt)-pcr is the most sensitive method
to measure changes in mrna concentrations. published
real-time rt-pcr assays include a method for  xxxg1187xxx

quantification (13 ) and an assay for  xxxg1186xxx  and 2
expression in sheep (14 ). both assays normalize target
gene expression to a single housekeeping gene.
our goal was to study changes in  xxxg1186xxx  and 2
expression in different blood cell populations to obtain
further insight into mechanisms underlying these activity
changes and provide further information on the contribution of each isoform. we report here an rt-pcr– based
assay combining the determination of expression of both
human impdh isoenzymes based on normalization to a
housekeeping gene index.

materials and methods
patients and samples
we collected whole blood specimens from healthy volunteers (n ⫽ 8) for assay development. to evaluate the
utility of the assay we also obtained specimens from
individuals enrolled in 2 ongoing studies focusing on the
impact of immunosuppressive drugs on impdh expression. one study included renal allograft recipients, from
whom samples were drawn predose on 11 occasions
before they received transplants and during the 1st 2
weeks posttransplantation. routine immunosuppression
included cyclosporine,  xxxd2677xxx  (mmf),
and steroids. the 2nd study included healthy volunteers
receiving a single dose of mmf (0.25–1.0 g), followed by
impdh expression measurement in 9 samples drawn
predose and the first 24 h after dose. the regional
committee for medical research ethics approved both
studies, and informed consent was obtained from all
participants. the assay was also adapted to measure
impdh expression in cultured lymphoblasts (molt-4;
european collection of animal cell cultures).
to assess the expression profile in whole blood cells,
we collected 2.5 ml blood in paxgene blood rna tubes
(preanalytix). we isolated cd4⫹ cells from 3 ml edta
blood using paramagnetic beads coated with cd4 antibodies (dynal biotech) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, except for a shortened incubation time of 15
min and 2 washes with pbs. we isolated erythrocytes
from 2 ml edta blood by filtration through a column
containing ␣-cellulose and microcrystalline cellulose (15 ).
we lysed isolated blood cells with lysis/binding buffer
(roche) and froze all prepared samples at ⫺70 °c until
rna isolation.

rna isolation
after thawing the paxgene tubes, we centrifuged a 1-ml
aliquot (corresponding to 0.3 ml whole blood) at 3500g
for 10 min. the pellet was suspended in lysis/binding
buffer and transferred to sample cartridges. we transferred lysates of erythrocytes, cd4⫹ cells (4 –9 ⫻ 105), and
molt-4 cells (2– 8 ⫻ 105) to sample cartridges after
thawing and vortex mixing. total rna was extracted
from 720-␮l aliquots and eluted in 50 ␮l buffer using the
magna pure hp rna extraction reagent set on the

magna pure instrument (roche). rna was stored at
⫺70 °c until further processing.
rna analysis. we measured rna concentration and purity spectrophotometrically on the nanodrop nd-1000
instrument (nanodrop technologies). we assessed rna
quality by electrophoresis using the rna 6000 pico labchip kit on the agilent bioanalyzer 2100 (both agilent
technologies). the rna integrity number (rin) algorithm (agilent 2100 expert software) and calculations of
the 28s-to-18s rrna band intensity ratio were used to
evaluate rna integrity.

reverse transcription
we used ms2 rna (roche) as carrier rna in all steps at
a final concentration of 10 mg/l. the reverse transcription reaction was performed in a thermal cycler (ptc0150; mj research). we compared 2 different reverse
transcription enzymes, transcriptor (roche) and superscript iii (invitrogen), and 2 different priming strategies,
random hexamers (roche and invitrogen), and oligo(dt)
primers (invitrogen). we tested the reverse transcription
linearity by running rt-pcr on serial dilutions of isolated
rna and rna stock solutions (roche).
the optimized reverse transcription reaction involved
preincubation of a 13-␮l mixture of 5 ␮l total rna, 0.08
a260 random primers p(dn)6, and h2o (pcr grade)
before adding roche reaction buffer, 20 u roche rnase
inhibitor, roche dntp-mix (1 mmol/l each), and 10 u
transcriptor reverse transcriptase to a total volume of 20
␮l. reaction parameters are listed (see table 1 in the
online data supplement that accompanies this article at
www.clinchem.org/content/vol53/issue6). we stored all
cdna samples at ⫺20 °c until analysis.

quantitative real-time pcr
real-time pcr. we performed real-time pcr on the roche
lightcycler 1.0 instrument. sybr green i (roche) was
used to monitor the amplification during the optimizing
stages, and hybridization probes were used for
quantification.
we titrated template concentrations to identify potential pcr inhibitors. the optimized reaction mixture contained 2 ␮l cdna, 3.5 and 4.5 mmol/l mgcl2 for
 xxxg1186xxx  and 2, respectively, 0.5 ␮mol/l sense primer
and 1 ␮mol/l antisense primer for both target genes,
0.225 ␮mol/l donor and acceptor probe for both target
genes, lightcycler fast start dna master hybridization
probes reagent, and pcr-grade h2o to a final volume of
20 ␮l. the reaction parameters are provided in table 1 of
the online data supplement.
the crossing point (cp), defined as the pcr cycle
where the fluorescence rises above background noise, was
calculated automatically by the 2nd-derivative maximum
method (lightcycler software version 3.5; roche).

oligonucleotide design. sequences for  xxxg1186xxx  and 2, 2
known pseudogenes, and  xxxg436xxx  ( xxxg342xxx  and  xxxg756xxx -like
apoptosis regulator) were obtained from genbank. genespecific primers were designed using oligo 6.60 software
(molecular biology insights); hybridization probe design
additionally involved the lightcycler probe design software (roche) combined with manual evaluation of alternative sequences. we also used the software to assess the
probability of primer dimer or hairpin formation and to
estimate melting temperatures. we checked the primer
and probe target sequences for possible homologies with
other sequences by applying basic local alignment
search tool searches. primers and probes (see table 2 in
the online data supplement) were synthesized by tib
molbiol.
primers were designed to give amplification products
spanning different exons to selectively amplify cdna and
not genomic dna. all samples were treated with dnase
i (roche) during rna purification.
quantification. we evaluated 5 housekeeping genes
(housekeeping gene selection set; roche): ␦- xxxd148xxx  synthase 1 ( xxxg122xxx ), ␤2-microglobulin (b2m),  xxxg825xxx  (g6pd), hypoxanthine
phosphoribosyltransferase 1 ( xxxg1075xxx ), and hydroxymethylbilane synthase (hmbs; formerly pbgd, porphobilinogen deaminase), as potential references for relative
quantification. the first 3 genes were selected for normalization. in the cd4⫹ cells, however, only  xxxg122xxx  and b2m
were selected, because there was a tendency toward
coregulation of g6pd and  xxxg1186xxx . we assayed all
samples and a cdna calibrator, included in each amplification reaction, in triplicate. quantification of target
gene expression was relative to the geometric mean
expression of the selected housekeeping genes in the same
sample. this ratio was normalized to the corresponding
ratio calculated for the calibrator. gene-specific amplification efficiency values were used in these calculations to
adjust for efficiency differences. an included gene-specific calibrator (104 copies) served as a positive control and
allowed estimation of absolute template concentrations by
use of preformed calibration curves.

rectly after amplification. we sequenced  xxxg1186xxx  and 2
amplification products using bigdye terminator chemistry on an abi prism 3100 genetic analyzer (applied
biosystems). reverse transcriptase negative controls and
template negative controls were included in the pcrs.
calibration curves. we constructed calibration curves to
determine reaction efficiencies, linearity, detection and
quantification limits, and to relate cp values to template
concentrations. pcr products were purified by agarose
gel (1.2%) electrophoresis, excised, and eluted from the
gel using a montage dna gel extraction device (millipore). an equimolar quantity of each gene-specific pcr
product was serially diluted, and 4 – 6 replicates of each
concentration (106–10 copies/reaction) were amplified.
we created calibration curves by plotting the log number
of cdna copies corresponding to each calibrator vs their
corresponding cp value. to assess a possible effect of
matrix components on the pcr efficiency, we amplified a
dilution series of heterogeneous cdna samples. the pcr
efficiency was calculated from the slope of the calibration
curve according to the equation e ⫽ 10(⫺1/slope) (16 ). we
constructed calibration curves on 5 independent occasions
and determined the repeatability of the slope and
intercept.
imprecision. we measured assay imprecision by calculating the cv of relative concentrations and normalized
ratios of gene expression. we assessed the variability of
the reverse transcription step by synthesizing cdna on 3
days and amplifying these cdnas in a single pcr run.
imprecision of the post–reverse transcription steps was
calculated for the entire dynamic range based on the
replicates that generated the calibration curves. calibrator
stability and the imprecision of the post–reverse transcription steps were determined in 20 calibrator samples run
repeatedly over a 2-year period. to assess within-run
variability of the complete rt-pcr assay, we measured
relative  xxxg1186xxx  and 2 expression in 5 replicates originating from the same whole blood sample. this was
repeated on 3 occasions to measure the total rt-pcr
between-run imprecision.

data analysis
we analyzed results of the rt-pcr assay with lightcycler software version 3.5. relative gene expression calculations, including housekeeping indexes, were performed
using lightcycler relative quantification software version 1.0 (roche) and rest-384 software version 1 (http://
www.gene-quantification.de). we evaluated gene expression changes using the wilcoxon signed-rank test (spss
version 13.0), and defined p values ⬍0.05 as significant.

rna isolation. isolation of total rna resulted in concentrations of 7–28, 4 –26, and 2–13 mg/l with paxgene,
cd4⫹ cell, and reticulocyte samples, respectively. yields
were donor dependent, probably resulting from fluctuations in the number of blood cells. the mean 260/280 nm
absorption ratios were ⬎1.9 for all sample types. the
mean rin values were 8.3, 9.5, and 6.7 for paxgene,
cd4⫹ cell, and reticulocyte samples, respectively. the
28s:18s rrna band intensity ratio ranged from 0.4 to 1.9.
the shapes of the amplification and melting curves were
similar for samples and positive controls, indicating the
presence of intact rna.

reverse transcription. random hexamer priming was more
efficient than oligo(dt) priming for  xxxg1186xxx  and the
selected housekeeping genes, decreasing cp by 0.3 to 2.0
cycles. for  xxxg1187xxx , oligo(dt) priming decreased cp
values by 0.4 cycles. transcriptor was preferred over
superscript iii, since it resulted in a slightly greater yield
and a shortened incubation time of 15 min. the reverse
transcription reaction proved to be linear from 5 ⫻ 102 to
5 ⫻ 106 rna copies, and a constant volume of total rna
was used in the reverse transcription reaction for further
applications.
amplification. pcr efficiencies for  xxxg1186xxx  and 2 were
2.03 and 1.99, whereas the efficiencies for  xxxg122xxx , b2m,
and g6pd were 1.99, 1.99, and 1.96, respectively. amplification of a heterogeneous cdna pool showed pcr
efficiencies similar to those of the purified cdna, and
therefore calibration curves for further applications were
based on the latter material. depending on the gene,
material, yield, and patient status, the cp values ranged
from 19 to 38 cycles. reticulocyte and paxgene samples
resulted in the highest ( xxxg1186xxx  30 –38;  xxxg1187xxx  31–36;
n ⫽ 30, day 1) and lowest ( xxxg1186xxx  26 –30;  xxxg1187xxx 
26 –31; n ⫽ 30, day 1) cp values, respectively.

fig. 1 in the online data supplement). repeated generation of the calibration curves resulted in cvs ⬍1.7% and
⬍0.8% for slope and intercept, respectively. assay sensitivity was confirmed by the slopes (absolute values 3.04 –
3.26) of the linear regression curves used to measure the
dynamic range (see fig. 1 in the online data supplement).
the detection limit was 10 templates per reaction, defined
as the lowest starting template concentration resulting in
an amplification curve. the lower limit of quantification
was set to 103 templates per reaction, since lower concentrations resulted in a significant increase in imprecision,
from cv ⱕ12.0% to ⱖ25.7% (fig. 1).
the total between-day rt-pcr cvs were 10.4% and
13.4% (normalized values) for  xxxg1186xxx  and 2, respectively. further details of assay imprecision are given in

all tested housekeeping genes were detectable in the
relevant samples.  xxxg1075xxx  was excluded because of its role
in purine metabolism, suggesting coregulation with impdh (4 ). hmbs expression was lower compared with the
target genes (in a representative series, n ⫽ 4 samples,
hmbs cp ranged from 36 to 39, compared with  xxxg1186xxx 
30 –32 and  xxxg1187xxx  30 –33). expression and reaction kinetics were similar for the selected housekeeping genes,
 xxxg122xxx , b2m, and g6pd, and the target genes. expression
results obtained from cd4⫹ cell samples indicated potential coregulation of g6pd and  xxxg1186xxx . with the exception of g6pd in cd4⫹ cells, results obtained after separate
normalization against each of the housekeeping genes
showed the same trends as the results after normalization
to the geometric mean of the expression. the target and
reference gene expression results showed the following
tendencies in the tested sample types: b2m ⬎ g6pd ⬎
 xxxg1186xxx  ⱖ  xxxg1187xxx  ⬎  xxxg122xxx . the differences between
 xxxg1186xxx  and 2 expressions were largest in the cd4⫹ cells.

lower limit of quantification was set to 103 templates per reaction.

reverse transcription reaction were 2.0% and 5.5% for
 xxxg1186xxx  and 2, respectively.

application
we applied the assay to a limited number of samples from
a renal transplant recipient. initiation of immunosuppressive therapy after transplantation was associated with
fluctuations in  xxxg1186xxx  and 2 expression (fig. 2). within
the 1st 1– 4 h after a single dose of mmf, healthy volunteers demonstrated downregulation of  xxxg1186xxx  and upregulation of  xxxg1187xxx . samples drawn on 4 occasions
from a control individual not receiving immunosuppressive drugs demonstrated no significant changes of  xxxg1186xxx  or 2 expression (relative expression range, n ⫽ 4;
 xxxg1186xxx  paxgene 0.98 –1.06, cd4⫹ cells 0.63– 0.69;  xxxg1187xxx  paxgene 0.36 – 0.41, cd4⫹ cells 1.94 –2.18; i.e., all
ranges well within the cv of the assay). cultured cells
incubated with 0.05– 0.5 ␮mol/l mpa for 72 h showed an
increase in impdh enzyme activity, measured by hplc,
which was reflected by similar changes in  xxxg1186xxx  and 2
expression. the maximum increase of ⬃60% in impdh
basal activity (from a mean of 39 pmol xmp/106 cells/
min), as well as  xxxg1187xxx  expression (increase by median
factor of 2.03, range 2.0 –2.4, n ⫽ 3 experiments), was
observed after incubation with 0.15 ␮mol/l mpa.

discussion
we developed and validated an assay for  xxxg1186xxx  and 2
mrna quantification in whole blood, cd4⫹ cells, and
reticulocytes. the focus of our studies was the impact of
the impdh inhibitor mpa, and concomitantly administered drugs such as steroids, on the expression of the
impdh isoforms. we analyzed whole blood cells to study
 xxxg1186xxx  and 2 expression in relation to the impdh
enzyme activity measured in whole blood. lymphocytes,
and cd4⫹ cells in particular, play a pivotal role in graft
rejection, and mpa exerts its effects primarily by affecting
lymphocytes. we therefore specifically studied cd4⫹
cells. erythrocytes constitute the largest population of
blood cells and probably influence the whole blood impdh enzyme activity. expression in reticulocytes, which
contain some preformed mrna, could provide a sensitive indicator for changes in the impdh expression and
activity of erythrocytes, since reticulocytes represent the
most newly formed population.
the results with this assay revealed  xxxg1186xxx  and 2
gene regulation after initiation of immunosuppressive
therapy. this regulation was observed in patient samples
as well as in cultured cells, and both steroids and mpa
seem to be involved (fig. 2). in single-dose studies of
healthy volunteers, the preliminary data indicate a qualitatively different response. although these data so far are
sparse, they could support the hypothesis that steroids
(not administered to the healthy volunteers) may be the
most important factor regulating impdh expression early
after transplantation. the impdh expression changes
might influence immunosuppressive response and the

blood, cd4⫹ cells, and reticulocytes were obtained from a renal transplant

on these findings in the continuation of the mentioned
studies.

bremer et al.: pcr determination of  xxxg1186xxx  and 2 in blood cells

paxgene tubes offer a convenient and efficient way to
stabilize rna (17 ). rna from cd4⫹ cells, reticulocytes,
and molt-4 cells was stabilized in guanidine thiocyanate
buffer within an hour after sampling. the rin values
showed isolation of intact rna from paxgene and cd4⫹
cell samples. reticulocyte samples resulted in lower but
acceptable rin values, probably because of lower rna
content and longer processing time before rna stabilization. the 28s:18s ribosomal rna band ratio was dependent on rna input concentration and showed a larger
degree of variability. this assay includes gene sequences
shorter than 200 nucleotides, which usually can be successfully reverse transcribed and amplified even when
rna is partially degraded.
this is the first rt-pcr assay using hybridization
probes for specific quantification of both human  xxxg1186xxx 
and 2. variations in cell numbers and populations occurring because of drug treatment or immunological conditions might contribute to the observed variation in yield
and expression. single-template detection is theoretically
feasible in real-time rt-pcr, but distribution statistics at
low template concentrations influence the actual lower
limit of detection, as illustrated by the increase in cvs
with decreasing template concentrations shown in fig. 1.
low-template reactions may also lead to underestimation
of the copy number due to relatively higher unspecific
background amplification competing for reagents. the
log–linear inverse relationship between concentrations
and cp values indicates that cvs based on relative
concentrations will be nominally higher than cvs based
on cp values. we calculated cvs in terms of relative
concentrations and the final normalized ratios. these cvs
are directly applicable and relevant for the interpretation
of results presented in terms of relative concentrations.
within-run and total imprecision were ⬍25%, which may
be an acceptable limit in this type of assay. repeated
analysis of the calibrator sample, already included in each
run, demonstrated the stability of the cdna material over
a 2-year period (table 1).
we determined gene-specific pcr efficiencies and
used them in the expression calculations to correct for
gene- and assay-specific factors. the linear calibration
curves indicate constant amplification efficiencies over
the concentration range studied, confirming minimal influence of pcr inhibitors.
relative expression results may be influenced by interindividual differences in housekeeping gene expression.
when fluctuations over time are studied in individuals,
such variability will be of less importance. normalization
of the target gene expression to an expression ratio of
several housekeeping genes further compensates for this,
and for variations in the sample amount, rna recovery,
rna integrity, efficiency of cdna synthesis, presence of
inhibitors, and differences in the overall transcriptional
activity of the tissues or cells analyzed. earlier published
methods use normalization to a single housekeeping gene
such as  xxxg861xxx  or

␤-actin (13, 14 ). there is, however, no known ubiquitous,
stably expressed reference gene. to strengthen the accuracy of this assay, the target gene expressions were
normalized to the geometric mean expression of 3 reference genes, a housekeeping gene index. reference genes
were selected among ubiquitously expressed genes from
different functional classes to reduce the influence of
coregulation.

clinical applications
the association between increased impdh activity and
cellular proliferation and malignant transformation
makes this enzyme a potential target for treatment in
organ transplantation and for malignant disorders. the 2
impdh isoforms are associated with different functions
and gene regulation, and proliferation and neoplastic
transformation are reported to be linked to increased
 xxxg1187xxx  expression (18, 19 ). assessment of the relative
importance and contribution of the impdh isoforms to
intracellular processes in various disease states will provide information to establish whether both enzymes are
valid therapeutic targets. elucidation of the association
between the impdh isoforms’ gene expression and immunosuppression or malignancy might also provide an
opportunity for the monitoring of treatment effect or
disease activity. the presented  xxxg1186xxx  and 2 expression
assay will be a useful tool for such applications.
