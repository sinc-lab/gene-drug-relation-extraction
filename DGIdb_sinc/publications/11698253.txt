jiang, gengru, janet d. klein, and w. charles
o’neill. growth factors stimulate the na-k-2cl cotransporter  xxxg2079xxx  through a novel cl⫺-dependent mechanism.
am j physiol cell physiol 281: c1948– xxxd2366xxx , 2001.—the
na-k-2cl cotransporter  xxxg2079xxx  is an important volumeregulatory transporter that is regulated by cell volume and
intracellular cl⫺. this regulation appears to be mediated by
phosphorylation of  xxxg2079xxx , although there is evidence for
additional, cytoskeletal regulation via myosin light chain
(mlc) kinase.  xxxg2079xxx  is also activated by growth factors and
may contribute to cell hypertrophy, but the mechanism is
unknown. in aortic endothelial cells,  xxxg2079xxx  (measured as
bumetanide-sensitive 86rb⫹ influx) was rapidly stimulated
by serum, lysophosphatidic acid, and fibroblast growth factor, with the greatest stimulation by serum. serum increased
bumetanide-sensitive influx significantly more than bumetanide-sensitive efflux (131% vs. 44%), indicating asymmetric
stimulation of  xxxg2079xxx , and produced a 17% increase in cell
volume and a 25% increase in cl⫺ content over 15 min.
stimulation by serum and hypertonic shrinkage were additive, and serum did not increase phosphorylation of  xxxg2079xxx 
or mlc, and did not decrease cellular cl⫺ content. when
cellular cl⫺ was replaced with methanesulfonate, influx via
 xxxg2079xxx  increased and was no longer stimulated by serum,
whereas stimulation by hypertonic shrinkage still occurred.
based on these results, we propose a novel mechanism
whereby serum activates  xxxg2079xxx  by reducing its sensitivity
to inhibition by intracellular cl⫺. this resetting of the cl⫺
set point of the transporter enables the cotransporter to
produce a hypertrophic volume increase.
na-k-2cl cotransport; serum; lysophosphatidic acid; fibroblast growth factor; intracellular chloride; vascular endothelium

the ubiquitous form of the na-k-2cl cotransporter
( xxxg2079xxx ) has several important functions, including
regulation of cell volume and intracellular cl⫺ concentration ([cl⫺]) and the vectorial transport of salt across
secretory epithelia. consequently, the transporter is
regulated both by cell volume and intracellular cl⫺.
the mechanisms responsible for this regulation are
complex and poorly understood. activity of  xxxg2079xxx  is
increased by inhibitors of protein phosphatases and
reduced by kinase inhibitors (10, 26), and phosphorylation of the transporter is increased by cell shrinkage

or by a reduction in intracellular [cl⫺] (6, 9, 16, 17).
phosphorylation occurs at the same site or sites with
either stimulus (14), suggesting that  xxxg2079xxx  is activated by a specific protein kinase. we have recently
identified c-jun amino-terminal kinase as a volumesensitive kinase capable of phosphorylating  xxxg2079xxx  in
vitro (8).
additional regulation of  xxxg2079xxx  occurs through myosin light chain (mlc), the phosphorylation of which is
increased by cell shrinkage (9, 27). inhibition of mlc
kinase ( xxxg1491xxx ) blocks  xxxg2079xxx  activation in endothelial cells (9), ehrlich ascites cells (11), colonic epithelial
cells (7), and vascular smooth muscle (1), and in endothelial cells this is independent of cotransporter phosphorylation. activation of the cotransporter in colonic
epithelial cells is also affected by agents that alter
f-actin (7, 18, 19). the mechanism by which the cellular contractile apparatus or cytoskeleton regulates
 xxxg2079xxx  is not known.
although intracellular cl⫺ affects phosphorylation
of the cotransporter (6, 17), regulation by this ion is
probably more complex and has important implications. despite being phosphorylated and activated by
hypertonic shrinkage,  xxxg2079xxx  does not produce a net
influx of ions, despite being thermodynamically favored (13, 21). net influx and volume recovery after
shrinkage only occur when intracellular [cl⫺] is reduced (isosmotic shrinkage). this is consistent with the
asymmetric activation of  xxxg2079xxx  observed in endothelial cells (21). influx and efflux via  xxxg2079xxx  are stimulated in parallel by hypertonic shrinkage (increased
intracellular [cl⫺]), but with isosmotic shrinkage (reduced intracellular [cl⫺]) influx is stimulated more
than efflux. this has led us to hypothesize that intracellular cl⫺, independent of  xxxg2079xxx  phosphorylation,
blocks outward translocation of the unloaded cotransporter, thereby preventing net influx when intracellular [cl⫺] is high. unidirectional influx can still be
stimulated but only represents exchange with intracellular ions. inhibition of  xxxg2079xxx  by cl⫺ therefore provides a simple feedback mechanism for regulating cell
volume and intracellular [cl⫺].

growth factor regulation of  xxxg2079xxx 

the regulation of  xxxg2079xxx  by intracellular cl⫺ becomes important in considering the activation of
 xxxg2079xxx  by growth factors (2, 23, 25). cotransportmediated increases in cell volume may occur (22) and
may be important for subsequent growth, since inhibition of  xxxg2079xxx  can block proliferation (5, 24) and overexpression of cotransporters can cause transformation
(12). activation of  xxxg2079xxx  in the absence of cell shrinkage should lead to an increase in cell volume, but this
could be prevented or limited by intracellular cl⫺. for
instance, direct phosphorylation and activation of
 xxxg2079xxx  in endothelial cells by  xxxd411xxx  does not increase cell volume (10). thus an increase in cell volume
may require either a decrease in intracellular [cl⫺] or
an increase in the cl⫺ set point of the cotransporter.
despite the potential importance of  xxxg2079xxx  in cell
growth, the mechanism by which it is activated by
growth signals and mediates a hypertrophic volume
increase remains unknown.
materials and methods

cell culture. endothelial cells were cultured from bovine
aortas as previously described in dmem medium with 10%
fetal bovine serum (21). subconfluent cells were washed
twice with serum-free medium (50% dmem, 50% ham’s
f-12, 0.5 mg/ml transferrin, 0.2 mm ascorbate) and then
incubated in the same for 72 h with medium changes at 24
and 48 h.
na-k-2cl cotransporter activity. cotransporter activity
was measured as unidirectional k⫹ influx inhibited by 50 ␮m
bumetanide, using 86rb⫹ as a tracer, as previously described
(21). after a 5-min incubation in assay medium, 86rb⫹ was
added for 10 min, followed by washing in ice-cold 110 mm
mgcl2. efflux of 86rb⫹ was measured as previously described
after a 2-h loading period. medium was removed and replaced at 2-min intervals, and rate coefficients (the fraction of
86
rb⫹ leaving the cells/min) were calculated before and 5 min
after addition of serum. standard isotonic solution was
earle’s salts with hepes substituted for hco3⫺, containing
(in mm) 130 nacl, 5.4 kcl, 1.8 cacl2, 0.8  xxxd2534xxx , 1
nah2po4, 5 glucose, and 26 hepes, ph 7.4. the measured
osmolality was 290 mosmol/l. hypertonic medium contained
an additional 150 mm sucrose so as not to alter the concentration of any transported ion.
cell volume and cl⫺ content. cell water was measured by
equilibration of [14c]urea as previously described (21). cells
were incubated with [14c]urea with or without serum or
added nacl for 15 min, followed by rapid washing in ice-cold
medium to remove extracellular urea. medium was made
hypertonic by the addition of 75 mm nacl instead of sucrose,
to avoid altering the thermodynamics of the cotransporter.
for measurement of cl⫺ content, cells were preincubated
with 36cl⫺ in standard isotonic medium for 30 min and then
washed with ice-cold, isosmotic sodium gluconate 15 min
after addition of serum and/or bumetanide.
phosphorylation assays. these assays were performed as
previously described (9), with some modifications. cells were
incubated in phosphate-free dmem containing 0.1 mci/ml
[32p]orthophosphate for 3 h at 37°c. to determine phosphorylation of  xxxg2079xxx , cells were extracted with 0.1% sds in
k⫹-free pbs for 20 min at room temperature. a sixfold

was added, and the samples were sheared with a 26 g needle
and incubated on ice for 60 min. after centrifugation to
remove insoluble material, supernatants were incubated
overnight with monoclonal anti- xxxg2079xxx  (t4) and then for 2 h
at 4°c with protein g-sepharose (gibco, grand island, ny).
the sepharose was washed with buffer a containing 1%
triton x-100 to remove all unbound radioactivity and then
suspended in sample buffer (2% sds, 5%  xxxd26xxx ,
10% glycerol, in  xxxd3449xxx ) and boiled. to examine phosphorylation of mlc, cells were extracted with a buffer containing 0.2% triton x-100, 10 mm pipes, ph 6.8, 100 mm
kcl, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm edta, 1 mm pmsf, 10 mm
naf, and 1 ␮g/ml leupeptin. the remaining cytoskeletons
were solubilized in sample buffer, sheared with a 26 g
needle, and boiled. proteins were separated on 7.5%
( xxxg2079xxx ) or 15% (mlc) sds polyacrylamide gels, and phosphorylated proteins were identified by autoradiography.
reagents. 86rb⫹, [32p]orthophosphate, [14c]urea, and
36
cl⫺ were purchased from new england nuclear life sciences (boston, ma). t4 antibody was obtained from the
developmental studies hybridoma bank (university of
iowa). fetal bovine serum was obtained from atlanta biologicals (norcross, ga) and was heat-inactivated at 60°c for
30 min. all studies were performed with a single lot of serum.
lysophosphatidic acid (lpa) was purchased from avanti
polar lipids (alabaster, al) and resuspended in standard
isotonic medium without calcium and with 0.1% albumin
(fatty acid-free) at a concentration of 1 mm. fibroblast
growth factor was a gift from dr. robert swerlick.
results

the addition of serum to cells maintained for 3 days
in a serum-free medium devoid of growth factors produced a rapid stimulation of bumetanide-sensitive rb⫹
influx that peaked at 5 min and then declined but
remained elevated for at least 20 min (fig. 1). maximal
stimulation of  xxxg2079xxx  by serum occurred at 3% (data
not shown). lpa and  xxxg787xxx  also

stimulated bumetanide-sensitive rb⫹ influx (fig. 2),
but to a lesser extent than serum. stimulation by lpa
occurred at 3 ␮m and increased up to 100 ␮m (fig. 3).
because of the greater stimulation by serum and the
solubility problems with lpa, 3% serum was used for
all subsequent assays. the stimulation of  xxxg2079xxx  by
serum resulted in an increase in cell volume (fig. 4). in
the absence of serum, inhibition of  xxxg2079xxx  with bumetanide produced a small, insignificant reduction in
cell volume, as previously described (21). cell volume
increased 17% after exposure to serum for 15 min, and
almost all of this increase was inhibited by bumetanide. this indicated that stimulation of  xxxg2079xxx  by
serum increases cell volume, ruling out the possibility
that serum stimulates  xxxg2079xxx  through cell shrinkage.
serum also stimulated  xxxg2079xxx  in hypertonic medium

(fig. 5), indicating that the effects of shrinkage and
growth factors are additive. however, serum did not
produce a bumetanide-sensitive increase in cell volume
in hypertonic medium (data not shown).
because  xxxg2079xxx  is a bidirectional cotransporter, the
effects of serum on influx and efflux of rb⫹ were compared in matched plates of cells (fig. 6). we have
previously used this approach to show that influx and
efflux through  xxxg2079xxx  are equal in endothelial cells
under basal conditions and after hypertonic shrinkage
(21). thus, in the present study, no attempt was made
to quantitatively compare influx to efflux, which are
expressed in different units. however, the stimulation
of each by serum can be compared and was threefold
greater for influx than for efflux (131 ⫾ 35% vs. 44 ⫾
17%, p ⬍ 0.02), indicating that the activation of
 xxxg2079xxx  by serum is indeed asymmetric.

to determine how serum activates  xxxg2079xxx , we examined three known regulatory mechanisms:  xxxg2079xxx 
phosphorylation, mlc phosphorylation, and intracellular [cl⫺]. phosphorylation of  xxxg2079xxx  was examined
by immunoprecipitation from cells preincubated with
[32p]orthophosphate. in the autoradiogram shown in
fig. 7, phosphorylated  xxxg2079xxx  appears as a doublet at
⬃170 kda, the intensity of which increased only
slightly after addition of serum to serum-starved cells.
by comparison, a far greater increase in phosphorylation occurred after hypertonic shrinkage of serumreplete cells. densitometry performed on 11 separate
experiments revealed a 25 ⫾ 11% decrease in  xxxg2079xxx 
phosphorylation after addition of serum. previous
studies in endothelial cells have shown that  xxxg2079xxx 
activity is also regulated by phosphorylation of mlc
independent of  xxxg2079xxx  phosphorylation (9). phosphor-

ylation of mlc was also assessed in 32p-loaded cells
and is apparent as a band at 20 kda in the autoradiogram shown in fig. 8. there was a clear increase in
phosphorylation after hypertonic shrinkage, as previously described, but no increase after addition of serum
to serum-starved cells. because phosphorylation of
 xxxg2079xxx  and mlc appear to be the principal pathways
for activation of  xxxg2079xxx  by cell shrinkage, these results are consistent with the finding that serum does
not produce cell shrinkage. this indicates that serum
does not act through a volume-sensitive pathway,
which is supported by the fact that stimulation of
 xxxg2079xxx  by hypertonic shrinkage and serum are additive (fig. 5).
to examine the potential role of intracellular cl⫺,
changes in 36cl⫺ content were measured in cells preequilibrated with 36cl (fig. 9). in the basal state,
addition of bumetanide produced a small but significant decrease in cl⫺ content. the fact that there was
not a corresponding decrease in cell volume (fig. 4) can
be explained by the fact that cl⫺ is a minority anion in
cells and is thus altered to a much greater extent by
changes in cl⫺ flux than is cell volume. addition of
serum produced a 25 ⫾ 5% increase in cl⫺ content,
almost all of which was prevented by bumetanide. the
increase in cl⫺ content was greater than the increase
in cell water, indicating that intracellular [cl⫺] increased. this is consistent with a net influx of cl⫺
through  xxxg2079xxx  and indicates that a decrease in in-

this novel mechanism for regulation of  xxxg2079xxx  enables cells to respond appropriately to growth stimulation. while regulation of  xxxg2079xxx  by cell volume and
intracellular cl⫺ is homeostatic, maintaining cell volume
and intracellular [cl⫺], activation by growth factors is
independent of either and is therefore dynamic, with the
potential to increase cell volume and intracellular [cl⫺].
this potential is only realized because the normal feedback inhibition that regulates intracellular [cl⫺] (and
therefore cell volume as well) is abrogated, thus explaining the hypertrophic volume increase that is observed. a
rapid increase in cell volume is an early response to
growth stimuli and may be required for normal growth
(20). inhibition of  xxxg2079xxx  by either furosemide or bumetanide blocks the proliferative response of endothelial cells
to fibroblast growth factor (24).
although changes in intracellular [cl⫺] can alter
phosphorylation of  xxxg2079xxx , some previous data have
supported, albeit indirectly, an additional effect of cl⫺

tracellular [cl⫺] cannot explain the stimulation of
 xxxg2079xxx  by serum.
another possible mechanism for stimulation of  xxxg2079xxx 
is a decrease in the sensitivity of the transporter to
inhibition by intracellular cl⫺. to test this, cells were
preincubated in isotonic medium containing methanesulfonate, a cell-permeant anion, in place of cl⫺ for 30 min.
bumetanide-sensitive influx increased in cl⫺-depleted
cells, consistent with inhibition of  xxxg2079xxx  by intracellular cl⫺, and there was no additional stimulation by serum (fig. 10). this could not be explained by the possibility that  xxxg2079xxx  is already maximally stimulated by
depletion of cl⫺, since further stimulation occurred after
hypertonic shrinkage. these results demonstrate that
serum stimulates  xxxg2079xxx  by modulating the inhibitory
effect of intracellular cl⫺.
discussion

investigation of the regulation of  xxxg2079xxx  has focused primarily on cell volume and intracellular cl⫺.
although these parameters are linked under physiological conditions, they are clearly independent regulators of  xxxg2079xxx . a decrease in cell volume can increase  xxxg2079xxx , even in the face of an increase in
intracellular [cl⫺] (i.e., hypertonic shrinkage), and a
decrease in intracellular [cl⫺] can stimulate  xxxg2079xxx  in
swollen cells (i.e., hypotonic swelling). our results
demonstrate that growth factors are an additional,
independent stimulus for  xxxg2079xxx , since neither cell
volume nor intracellular [cl⫺] was decreased. furthermore, this stimulation is independent of  xxxg2079xxx  phosphorylation, which has been thought to be the principal
mechanism for regulation by both cell volume and
intracellular cl⫺ (6, 14, 16, 17), and independent of
mlc phosphorylation, an additional volume-sensitive
regulatory pathway (1, 9). the fact that the stimulation by serum was abolished by removing intracellular
cl⫺ points instead to modulation of the cl⫺ sensitivity
of  xxxg2079xxx  that is independent of phosphorylation.

growth factor regulation of  xxxg2079xxx 

on  xxxg2079xxx . of particular interest are the differing
effects on  xxxg2079xxx  of hypertonic and isosmotic shrinkage, between which the only major difference is the
intracellular [cl⫺] (increasing in the former and decreasing in the latter). although  xxxg2079xxx  phosphorylation and unidirectional influx increase, and net influx
is thermodynamically favored in each case, net influx
of ions only occurs after the latter (21). this suggests
an effect of cl⫺ on the kinetics of  xxxg2079xxx  (for review,
see ref. 20). further evidence for this is the trans effect
of intracellular anions on the na-k-cl cotransporter in
internally perfused squid axons (3, 4), although an
effect on cotransporter phosphorylation cannot be
ruled out in these studies. one simple explanation is
that cl⫺, either directly or indirectly, blocks translocation of the empty cotransporter to the outer aspect of
the plasma membrane, preventing net influx and permitting only ion exchange, thereby providing a simple,
negative-feedback regulation of intracellular [cl⫺]. removal of this block would produce an asymmetric stimulation of influx and an increase in cell volume and cl⫺
content, as was observed. however, this cannot be the
only mechanism, since efflux also increased, and the
increase in unidirectional influx by serum in hypertonic medium was not accompanied by any net influx.
the mechanism by which serum alters the cl⫺ sensitivity of  xxxg2079xxx  is unclear, in part because the cl⫺sensing pathway is poorly understood. although many
effects of growth factors are mediated through phosphorylation, our data do not support changes in the
phosphorylation of  xxxg2079xxx . however, we cannot rule
out the possibility that there is a change in phosphorylation sites without a change in overall phosphorylation. if intracellular cl⫺ affects  xxxg2079xxx  through direct
binding, it is difficult to envision how this could be
altered by serum in the absence of  xxxg2079xxx  phosphorylation. alternatively,  xxxg2079xxx  may be regulated by a
cl⫺-sensing protein whose properties are regulated by
growth factor-dependent phosphorylation.
