abstract:

 xxxg1479xxx  catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from methylcobalamin enzyme
to homocysteine, generating methionine and  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme, and then from methyltetrahydrofolate
to  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme, generating tetrahydrofolate and regenerating the methylcobalamin enzyme. the
reactions catalyzed by  xxxg1479xxx  require deprotonation of the substrate, homocysteine, and
protonation of the product tetrahydrofolate, with no net change in proton stoichiometry for a complete
turnover cycle. in addition, formation of the intermediate  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme requires a change in the
cobalt ligand geometry from 6-coordinate to 4-coordinate, and this rearrangement may require the transient
protonation of protein residues to stabilize the  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme. in the e. coli enzyme, the lower
face of the methylcobalamin cofactor is coordinated by histidine 759, which is hydrogen bonded to aspartate
757 and then to serine 810, forming a “ligand triad”. it has previously been shown that reduction of
cob(ii)alamin enzyme to  xxxd1771xxx  is associated with the uptake of a proton from solution, and it has
been postulated that this proton resides within the his759-asp757 pair.  xxxd1771xxx  can also be generated
by demethylation of methylcobalamin enzyme by homocysteine; it was not known whether this mode of
 xxxd1771xxx  formation was associated with proton uptake. in this paper, we use equilibrium titrations
and kinetic analyses in the presence of the ph indicator dye phenol red, along with studies of the ph
dependence of oxidation/reduction equilibria, to identify and characterize mechanistic steps associated
with proton uptake and release in both the turnover and reactivation of the enzyme. we confirm that
 xxxd1771xxx  formation by reduction of cob(ii)alamin enzyme is associated with proton uptake and show
that mutation of asp757 to glu abolishes the ph dependence of this reduction. demethylation of
methylcobalamin enzyme also leads to  xxxd1771xxx  formation and is also shown to be associated with
proton uptake. by observing pre-steady-state reactions with homocysteine and methyltetrahydrofolate in
the presence of phenol red, we show that this proton uptake occurs at a rate that is equal to the rate of
formation of the  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme. in addition, we show that binding of homocysteine to the enzyme
results in the rapid release of a proton, presumably the homocysteine thiol proton. in contrast, binding
methyltetrahydrofolate to the enzyme does not result in proton uptake, suggesting that the proton destined
for the product tetrahydrofolate is already present on the free methylcobalamin enzyme.

 xxxg1479xxx  catalyzes the transfer of a methyl
group from ch3-h4folate1 to homocysteine, generating
methionine and h4folate. the  xxxg1479xxx  (meth) from escherichia coli catalyzes
this reaction in two steps: the enzyme-bound methylcobalamin prosthetic group is first demethylated by homocysteine,
generating methionine and the nucleophilic  xxxd1771xxx

intermediate. this intermediate is remethylated by ch3-h4folate, producing h4folate and regenerating the resting
methylcobalamin enzyme (figure 1). occasional oxidation
of the  xxxd1771xxx  intermediate leads to an inactive cob(ii)alamin enzyme; this species is returned to the catalytic
cycle by a reductive methylation that uses flavodoxin and
 xxxd3156xxx  as electron and methyl donors, respectively.
the reactions catalyzed by  xxxg1479xxx  require
changes in the protonation state of the substrates upon
conversion to products, as well as potential transient changes
in the protonation state of the enzyme during turnover and
reactivation. formation of methionine requires deprotonation
of the homocysteine thiol proton [pka ) 10.0 (1)] followed
by nucleophilic attack of the thiolate anion on the methylcobalamin cofactor. remethylation of the  xxxd1771xxx 
cofactor by ch3-h4folate requires protonation of n5 of the
product h4folate [pka ) 4.8 (2)]. this protonation event
may occur prior to or concurrent with methyl transfer to the
cofactor and has been proposed as a possible mode of
activation of ch3-h4folate towards nucleophilic attack (3,
4). in addition, formation of the intermediate  xxxd1771xxx 
enzyme requires a change in the cobalt ligand geometry from
6-coordinate to 4-coordinate; in model systems, this is

figure 1: schematic view of the reactions catalyzed by methionine
synthase. in the primary turnover cycle, homocysteine and ch3h4folate bind to the enzyme in a ternary complex prior to methyl
transfer from methylcobalamin to homocysteine. methyl transfer
from ch3-h4folate to  xxxd1771xxx  completes the reaction cycle
prior to product release. inactive enzyme is formed by one electron
oxidation of the  xxxd1771xxx  intermediate. the cob(ii)alamin
enzyme is returned to the primary turnover cycle by a electron
transfer from reduced flavodoxin and methyl transfer from  xxxd3156xxx .

figure 2: proposed protonation of the ligand triad during reduction
of cob(ii)alamin enzyme. the midpoint potential for this reduction
is ph dependent over the ph range 6.6-7.8, suggesting that
reduction and/or ligand dissociation is accompanied by protonation
of the enzyme (19). the structure of the b12-binding region shows
a hydrogen-bonded ligand triad his759-asp757-ser810, which we
propose is protonated during cob(ii)alamin reduction. the brackets
indicate a net charge of -1 distributed over his759 and asp757 in
the oxidized enzyme; this charge is neutralized by protonation in
the reduced enzyme.

facilitated by dissociation and protonation of the dimethylbenzimidazole ligand to the cobalt (5). in a similar manner,
protonation of protein residues ligated to the cofactor may
facilitate formation of the 4-coordinate  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme.
a 3.0 å resolution x-ray structure of the cobalaminbinding region of  xxxg1479xxx  has been obtained (6),
and the resolution has recently been extended to 2.4 å (c.
l. drennan, and m. l. ludwig, unpublished data). this
structure reveals that the methylcobalamin cofactor undergoes
a major conformational change on binding to methionine
synthase. the dimethylbenzimidazole ligand to cobalt in the
free cofactor dissociates from the cobalt on binding and is
replaced by a histidine residue from the protein. as
diagrammed in figure 2, his759 is hydrogen bonded to
asp757, which in turn is hydrogen bonded to ser810.
his759 and asp757 are shielded from solvent by protein
residues and the cobalamin cofactor, and only ser810 has
access to solvent. these three residues are conserved in the
six sequences for  xxxg1479xxx  currently in the
database, from e. coli (7, 8, 9), haemophilus influenzae (10),

jarrett et al.
mycobacterium leprae (11), synechocystis sp. (12), caenorhabditis elegans (13), and homo sapiens (14, 15, 16).
the his-asp-ser triad has an important role in catalysis:
mutation of his759 to gly completely abolishes activity,
while mutation of asp757 to glu or asn decreases activity
∼20-fold (17, 18). the triad forms a hydrogen-bonded
network that could allow control of the protonation state of
his759, which may be important in stabilizing 4-coordinate
cob(ii)alamin and  xxxd1771xxx  species and/or in facilitating
their interconversion.
earlier studies had determined that reduction of enzymebound cob(ii)alamin to  xxxd1771xxx  was associated with
proton uptake (19). in these studies, the midpoint potential
of the cob(ii)alamin/ xxxd1771xxx  couple was shown to
exhibit a -59 mv slope over the ph range from 6.6 to 7.4,
consistent with the uptake of one proton on reduction of the
cobalamin cofactor. an obvious candidate for protonation
was the his759-asp757 pair. since cob(ii)alamin is 5-coordinate both on the wild-type enzyme(20) and free in
solution (21), while  xxxd1771xxx  is preferentially 4-coordinate (5), it has been proposed that the his759-asp757-ser810
ligand triad shown in figure 2 accepts a proton from solvent
and dissociates from the cobalt on reduction of cob(ii)alamin
to  xxxd1771xxx  (6). we have somewhat arbitrarily depicted
the his759-asp757 pair as having a net charge of -1 in
figure 2, and protonation would thus result in formation of
a neutral his-asp pair. by analogy to the conversion of cob(ii)alamin to  xxxd1771xxx , conversion of 6-coordinate methylcobalamin to 4-coordinate  xxxd1771xxx  could also be
accompanied by proton uptake (6). however, it remained
to be established whether this proton uptake occurs on a time
scale which is relevant to catalysis and/or involves the ligand
triad.
this paper examines the changes in protonation of the
enzyme and substrates associated with catalysis and reactivation of the wild-type enzyme. we use the ph dependence
of the cob(ii)alamin/ xxxd1771xxx  redox potential for wildtype enzyme and the asp757glu mutant enzyme to suggest
that proton uptake occurs within the ligand triad upon
reduction of cob(ii)alamin enzyme. in order to distinguish
proton uptake within the ligand triad from proton uptake or
release due to substrate binding, we examine the binding of
substrates to the inactive cob(ii)alamin enzyme in the
presence of the ph indicator dye phenol red. these
experiments demonstrate the release of one proton upon
binding homocysteine to the enzyme, but show no change
in the protonation of the enzyme associated with ch3-h4folate binding. we then use equilibrium titrations and
enzyme-monitored stopped-flow spectroscopy in the presence
of phenol red to provide evidence that kinetically competent
proton uptake accompanies the formation of  xxxd1771xxx 
in the primary turnover cycle. we further confirm the
protonation states of the  xxxd1771xxx  and cob(ii)alamin
enzymes by oxidation of  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme to cob(ii)alamin and by photolysis of methylcobalamin enzyme to cob(ii)alamin in the presence of phenol red.
materials and methods
materials. construction of the asp757glu mutation of
 xxxg1479xxx  and the methods for expression and
purification of wild-type and mutant enzymes have been
described (17, 18) the following compounds were obtained

proton uptake and release in  xxxg1479xxx 
from the indicated commercial sources and used without
further purification: l-homocysteine thiolactone, s-adenosyll-methionine (iodide salt), dithiothreitol, and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) from sigma; methyl viologen, phenol
red, tempo, and protocatechuic acid from aldrich; (6r,s)ch3-h4folate (calcium salt) from schirks laboratories; and
[14c-methyl]-(6r,s)-ch3-h4folate (barium salt) from amersham. homocysteine thiolactone was hydrolyzed and neutralized prior to use in assays and titrations (22). 5-deazaflavin-3-sulfonic acid was a gift from professor vincent
massey (university of michigan), and protocatechuate dioxygenase was a gift from professor david ballou (university of michigan). phosphate buffer refers to potassium
phosphate buffer at ph 7.2 unless otherwise specified.
spectrophotometric measurement of the cob(ii)alamin/
 xxxd1771xxx  midpoint potential. the basic procedure for
determination of the midpoint potentials as a function of ph
was that described by drummond and matthews (19). a
detailed method for determination of the midpoint potential
is available as supporting information; a brief summary
follows. a solution was prepared that contained cob(ii)alamin enzyme (20-40 µm), methyl viologen (100 µm),
and 5-deazaflavin-3-sulfonate (5 µm) in a buffer of 100 mm
potassium phosphate, 100 mm kcl, and 25 mm edta and
was placed in an anaerobic quartz cuvette and equilibrated
with argon. the sample was cooled to 0 °c and reduced by
irradiation with a 600 w tungsten/halogen lamp. the
contents of the cell undergo slow oxidation over 2-3 h, and
spectra were recorded  xxxd1891xxx  min intervals throughout the
oxidation process. extraction of the midpoint potential for
each sample requires determination of the system potential
and the relative concentrations of cob(ii)alamin and  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme for each spectrum. changes in the cobalamin
spectra are approximately isosbestic at 600 nm for wild-type
and asp757glu enzymes; changes at these wavelengths were
used to determine the concentration of reduced methyl
viologen cation radical using 600 ) 13 600 (23). the cell
potential was determined from the concentration of reduced
and oxidized methyl viologen using a midpoint potential of
-446 mv vs she (23). the concentration of cob(ii)alamin
and  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme was determined for each spectrum
from the absorbance at 474 and 466 nm for wild-type and
asp757glu enzymes,2 respectively, after correcting for the
smaller spectral changes at these wavelengths attributable
to methyl viologen. at this point, a nernst plot of cell
potential vs log [cob(ii)alamin/ xxxd1771xxx ] allows estimation of the cobalamin midpoint potential for each sample.
the standard error is approximately (10 mv for each
determination.
determination of proton release in equilibrium titrations.
proton release accompanying the binding or reaction of
homocysteine with wild-type enzyme, the oxidation of  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme, and the photolysis of methylcobalamin
enzyme was monitored in the presence of phenol red. these
experiments were modeled after proton stoichiometry studies
of  xxxg641xxx  (24) and  xxxg602xxx 
(25). details of the procedure for using phenol red in
titrations and rapid kinetic experiments and for calculating
stoichiometries are available as supporting information; a
2 spectra of the wild-type and asp757glu enzyme in each of the
oxidation states described in this paper are available as supporting
information.

brief summary follows. for each titration, a solution was
prepared that contained enzyme (20 µm) and phenol red (40
µm) in a buffer containing 50 µm potassium phosphate and
100 mm kcl at ph 7.8, placed in an anaerobic cuvette and
equilibrated with argon. titration of enzyme samples with
10 mm naoh or hcl allowed determination of a stoichiometry conversion factor of -0.0063∆a558/µm h+ released
into solution. a sample of cob(ii)alamin enzyme and phenol
red (40 µm) was titrated with homocysteine (2 mm) and
phenol red (40 µm), and spectra were recorded after each
addition. after correcting for dilution, conversion of the
spectral changes at 558 nm to the change in h+ concentration
allows construction of a binding curve for homocysteine.
alternatively, a sample of methylcobalamin enzyme and
phenol red (40 µm) was titrated with homocysteine and
phenol red, resulting in spectral changes associated with  xxxd1771xxx  formation and h+ release; deconvolution of these
spectral changes is described in the supporting information.
to examine proton release during  xxxd1771xxx  oxidation, a
sample of  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme was produced by addition
of 1 equiv homocysteine to methylcobalamin enzyme and
phenol red (40 µm), and was then oxidized by titrating with
potassium ferricyanide (2 mm). finally, a sample of
methylcobalamin enzyme was exposed to a 100 w tungsten
lamp in the presence of tempo (400 µm) and phenol red
(40 µm) to examine h+ release during photolysis.
enzyme-monitored stopped-flow experiments in the presence of phenol red were performed to examine the kinetic
competence of proton uptake and release events. methylcobalamin enzyme and phenol red (40 µm) were equilibrated
with argon in one syringe, while homocysteine (200 µm),
(6-r,s)-ch3-h4folate (800 µm) and phenol red (40 µm) were
equilibrated with argon in the second syringe. spectra of
the samples were recorded prior to mixing and used to
estimate an initial absorbance for the mixed sample prior to
any reaction. after mixing, kinetic traces were obtained at
389, 480, and 558 nm, and the absorbance changes were
deconvoluted as described in the supporting information.
determination of ch3-h4folate binding by equilibrium
dialysis. radiolabeled [14c-methyl]ch3-h4folate was prepared as described previously for our standard steady state
assays (26), except that the specific activity was increased
to ∼20 000 dpm/nmol. both the enzyme and the ch3-h4folate were prepared in a buffer containing 100 mm
potassium phosphate, 8 mm sodium ascorbate, and 0.5 mm
edta, ph 7.2. the enzyme (1.2 nmol in 60 µl) was placed
in the inverted cap of a 0.5 ml microfuge tube, a small piece
(∼2 × 2 cm) of presoaked, damp dialysis tubing (∼12 kd
cutoff) was placed over the protein solution, and the inverted
microfuge tube was pressed over the tubing and cap. a small
hole was cut in the bottom of the microfuge tube and the
ch3-h4folate solution (0.5-10 nmol in 200 µl) was added
to the top of the dialysis membrane. the tubes were capped
with parafilm and incubated in the dark at room temperature
for 15 h. at this time, a portion of the upper solution
containing only free substrate (50 µl) was transferred to a
scintillation vial, and the remainder of the free substrate
solution was removed by inverting the tube in a 1.5 ml
microfuge tube and spinning at 500 rpm in a microcentrifuge.
the enzyme plus bound substrate solution (50 µl) was
removed by piercing the dialysis membrane with a syringe
and was transferred to a separate scintillation vial. the initial
substrate mix was a racemic mixture of (6s)- and (6r)-ch3-

natural 6s isomer. the free (6s)-ch3-h4folate was calculated from the initial total ch3-h4folate by subtracting the
calculated counts due to (6r)-ch3-h4folate. the concentrations of bound and free (6s)-ch3-h4folate are determined
by eqs 1 and 2, where sa is the specific activity of [14cmethyl]ch3-h4folate in counts per minute per nanomole.

results
 xxxd1771xxx  formation by reduction of cob(ii)alamin
enzyme is accompanied by proton uptake within the ligand
triad. the wild-type cob(ii)alamin prosthetic group is
primarily 5-coordinate with his759 ligated to the lower axial
position on the cobalt. reduction to the  xxxd1771xxx 
oxidation state requires reorganization of the cobalt ligand
environment to a planar 4-coordinate geometry (5) with
dissociation of the histidine ligand. this reorganization
would be favored by protonation of his759 or the hydrogenbonded asp757 residue; the resulting change in charge
should weaken the bond between his759 and the cobalt,
favoring formation of the 4-coordinate cofactor (figure 2).
the uptake of one proton upon reduction of cob(ii)alamin
enzyme was confirmed in the present study (figure 3), and
the data in drummond and matthews (19) was recalculated
using revised extinction coefficients for the enzyme (18),
giving a midpoint potential at ph 7 of em7 ) -490 ( 9
mv. the linear least-squares fit slope of -56 ( 6 mv
compares well with the theoretical slope of -59 mv
predicted for the uptake of a one proton upon reduction of
cob(ii)alamin enzyme to  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme. if the proton
is taken up within the his-asp-ser hydrogen-bonded network, then a mutation that disrupts this network should affect
the ph dependence of the midpoint potential. the midpoint
potential for the asp757glu mutant enzyme was measured

jarrett et al.

figure 4: titration of wild-type cob(ii)alamin enzyme with
homocysteine in the presence of phenol red in an anaerobic cuvette.
the release of a proton upon formation of the enzyme:homocysteine
complex results in a decrease in absorbance at 558 nm due to
protonation of phenol red. see materials and methods for a
description of the calculation of ∆h+/e from these spectral changes.
the initial ph was ∼7.8 and decreased less than 0.05 ph units
during the course of the titration. the data shown are an average
of five identical titrations and have been fit by a quadratic binding
curve with the enzyme concentration fixed at 20 µm, giving an
apparent kd of 5 µm with the release of 0.9 equiv of protons. (inset)

to cob(ii)alamin enzyme (20 µm) and phenol red (40 µm) at ph
7.8.

over a range from ph 6.6 to 7.6 and shows no ph
dependence, giving an average midpoint potential of -436
( 8 mv (figure 3). since this mutation completely
abolished the ph dependence of reduction, we propose that
the proton taken up upon reduction of the wild-type cob(ii)alamin enzyme resides within the his759-asp757 pair,
as depicted in figure 2.
homocysteine binding is accompanied by release of one
proton. the methyl transfer reactions catalyzed by  xxxg1479xxx  require the deprotonation of the substrate
homocysteine and the protonation of the product tetrahydrofolate, resulting in no net change in proton concentration
for a complete turnover cycle. we were able to characterize
proton release due to homocysteine binding by titrating the
inactive cob(ii)alamin enzyme with homocysteine in the
presence of the ph indicator dye, phenol red (pka ) 7.78
determined experimentally), which shows a strong decrease
in absorbance at 558 nm when the ph of the solution drops.
details of the titration procedure are described in the
materials and methods and in accompanying supporting
information.2
when homocysteine is added to cob(ii)alamin enzyme in
the presence of phenol red, there is a decrease in absorbance
at 558 nm due to proton release from the enzyme:homocysteine complex and the subsequent protonation of phenol red
(figure 4, inset). this change in absorbance corresponds to
the release of 0.9 ( 0.2 protons/mol  xxxg1479xxx 
with a kd(observed) of 5 ( 3 µm at ph 7.8 (figure 4). the
presence of saturating ch3-h4folate had no effect on these
results. the observed release of a proton suggests that the
enzyme tightly binds the homocysteine thiolate anion, despite
the relatively high microscopic pka of 10.0 measured for
the homocysteine thiol (1). this observation was not
unexpected, since neither methionine or homoserine is an
effective competitive inhibitor for homocysteine (ki g 1
mm). if it is assumed that the enzyme binds the homocysteine thiolate tightly, but that protonated homocysteine is
bound to the enzyme with an affinity similar to that for

proton uptake and release in  xxxg1479xxx

used to determine the affinity of cob(ii)alamin enzyme for the
substrate (squares). this data is fit to quadratic binding curve with
the enzyme concentration fixed at 20 µm and gives a kd of 5 µm.
titration of cob(ii)alamin enzyme with ch3-h4folate in the presence
of phenol red at ph 7.8 resulted in no changes in absorbance at
558 nm, indicating no uptake or release of protons upon formation
of the enzyme:ch3-h4folate complex (circles).

the true affinity for the thiolate anion to the observed affinity
at the ph of the experiment. an estimated kd for the thiolate

anion can be calculated to be ∼30 nm. several lines of
evidence now suggest that release of a proton from the
enzyme:homocysteine complex occurs when the thiolate
anion becomes coordinated to a zinc atom whose binding
site is localized to the n-terminal 353 amino acid residues
of  xxxg1479xxx  (27).
ch3-h4folate binding is not accompanied by proton
uptake or release. methyl transfer from ch3-h4folate to
 xxxd1771xxx  requires protonation of the product tetrahydrofolate. this proton could be taken up upon binding of ch3h4folate to the enzyme or at a later stage of catalysis, such
as just prior to or during methyl transfer from ch3-h4folate
to  xxxd1771xxx . we titrated methylcobalamin enzyme with
ch3-h4folate in the presence of phenol red. after correcting
for dilution, we observed no net change in the spectrum of
phenol red (figure 5), suggesting that there was no proton
uptake or release associated with formation of the enzyme:
ch3-h4folate complex. in a separate experiment using
radiolabeled ch3-h4folate, we measured the binding of ch3h4folate to cob(ii)alamin enzyme using equilibrium dialysis.
this experiment confirmed that ch3-h4folate was binding
to the enzyme over this concentration range with a kd of 5
µm. similar results were obtained using methylcobalamin
enzyme. these results reproduce those of taylor and hanna,
who showed that the affinity of ch3-h4folate for methionine
synthase was ph independent and gave a kd of 5 µm (28).
these results demonstrate that ch3-h4folate binding is not
associated with proton uptake and that the proton destined
for n5 of h4folate must be either already bound to the free
enzyme or taken up at a later stage of the catalytic cycle.
 xxxd1771xxx  formation during turnover is accompanied
by proton uptake.  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme is formed during
the primary turnover cycle upon demethylation of methylcobalamin enzyme by homocysteine (figure 1). although
the ph dependence of the equilibrium reduction of cob(ii)alamin enzyme indicated that the his-asp pair was proto-

addition of 1 equiv of homocysteine (indicated by dashed vertical
line) resulted in formation of 0.9 equiv of  xxxd1771xxx  (circles
and solid curve) and was accompanied by the release of e0.1 equiv
of protons (squares and dashed curve). since conversion of
homocysteine to methionine results in release of one proton,  xxxd1771xxx  formation must have been accompanied by uptake of ∼0.8
proton by the enzyme. further addition of homocysteine results in
release of 1 equiv of protons due to the weak binding of
homocysteine to the  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme (kd ≈ 25 µm). (b)

(- - - -) of a proton accompanying  xxxd1771xxx  formation.

nated in the resulting  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme, it was not clear
whether the formation of  xxxd1771xxx  during the primary
turnover cycle would also be associated with proton uptake.
to examine the proton stoichiometry upon conversion of
methylcobalamin enzyme to  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme directly,
we took advantage of the ability of  xxxg1479xxx  to
catalyze the irreversible transfer of a methyl group from
methylcobalamin enzyme to homocysteine in the absence
of ch3-h4folate. the methylation of homocysteine to form
methionine should result in the release of the thiol proton
into solution. thus, if the his759-asp757 pair does not take
up a proton upon conversion of methylcobalamin enzyme
to  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme, there should be stoichiometric
proton release into solution; conversely, if the his759asp757 pair takes up a proton upon conversion of methylcobalamin enzyme to  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme, there should be
no net change in the ph of the solution. we observed that
the initial formation of  xxxd1771xxx  is not accompanied by
a change in the absorbance of phenol red (figure 6),
suggesting that there is no net change in the ph of the
solution. thus,  xxxd1771xxx  formation appears to be accompanied by protonation of the  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme. after

ph 7.8 in an anaerobic stopped-flow spectrophotometer. pre-steadystate formation of 6.2 µm  xxxd1771xxx , monitored at 390 nm,
(circles and solid curve) is accompanied by uptake of 4.9 µm
protons (squares and dashed curve). differences between the
predicted and observed initial absorbance indicate the release of 1
equiv of protons due to homocysteine binding within the dead time
of the instrument and have been modeled using a rate constant of
2000 s-1 (- - - -). uptake of a proton then accompanies  xxxd1771xxx  formation and is fit to an apparent rate constant of 270
s-1 (- - - -).

conversion of ∼70% of the methylcobalamin enzyme to
 xxxd1771xxx , a proton release event is observed to gradually
compete with  xxxd1771xxx  formation. this is likely due to
the binding of a second equivalent of homocysteine to the
 xxxd1771xxx  enzyme, with a weak apparent kd of ∼25 µm.
to further confirm that  xxxd1771xxx  formation was not
accompanied by net proton uptake or release, we modeled
the difference spectrum obtained upon addition of 1 equiv
of homocysteine to the enzyme/phenol red solution (figure
6b). using separately obtained spectra of wild-type methylcobalamin and  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme and of protonated and
deprotonated phenol red, we were able to model the spectral
data (open circles) to conversion of 22 µm methylcobalamin
enzyme to  xxxd1771xxx  (solid line), with no accompanying
changes in the phenol red spectrum.
although equilibrium titrations suggested that  xxxd1771xxx 
formation is accompanied by proton uptake, these titrations
take several minutes to complete, and it is possible that this
proton uptake does not occur within the ca. 20-30 ms
lifetime of  xxxd1771xxx  formed during steady state turnover.
in order to establish the kinetic competence of proton release
due to homocysteine binding and proton uptake which
accompanies  xxxd1771xxx  formation, we monitored turnover
of the enzyme with homocysteine and ch3-h4folate in the
presence of phenol red in an anaerobic stopped-flow spectrophotometer. spectra of the enzyme/phenol red solution
and of the substrate/phenol red solution were used to estimate
an initial spectrum of the mixed sample prior to reaction.
comparison to the spectral data measured after rapidly
mixing the samples in the stopped-flow instrument suggested
that a proton had been released from the enzyme:substrate
complex within the dead time of the instrument; we suggest
that this proton release is due to rapid binding of homocysteine to the enzyme and release of the thiolate proton. we
have modeled this proton release in figure 7 with a rate
constant of 2000 s-1, although faster rates would be entirely
consistent with the observed data.
after ch3-h4folate and homocysteine are bound to the
enzyme, transfer of the methyl group from methylcobalamin
to homocysteine results in formation of  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme

jarrett et al.
with a net pre-steady-state rate constant of 270 s-1, as
observed at 389 and 480 nm (figure 7, circles). after
correcting the spectral data at 558 nm for contributions due
to changes in the spectrum of the cobalamin cofactor, we
observe net changes in the spectrum of phenol red at 558
nm, which suggest the uptake of a proton by the enzyme:
substrate complex at a rate of 250-300 s-1 (figure 7,
squares). by combining the predicted proton release due to
homocysteine binding and proton uptake due to  xxxd1771xxx 
formation, we are able to model the observed transient
changes in the proton stoichiometry, as shown by the heavy
dashed curve in figure 7. after 20 ms, a maximum of 6.2
µm  xxxd1771xxx  is formed (40% of the total enzyme) and
is accompanied by the uptake of 4.9 µm protons by the
enzyme, giving a stoichiometry of ∆h+/∆ xxxd1771xxx  )
0.79.
oxidation of  xxxd1771xxx  formed during primary turnover to cob(ii)alamin is associated with proton release.
equilibrium titrations and rapid pre-steady-state reactions in
the presence of phenol red suggest that conversion of
methylcobalamin enzyme to  xxxd1771xxx  is accompanied
by proton uptake within the enzyme. however, these
experiments are subject to spectral deconvolutions and
corrections that could potentially skew the results. in order
to confirm the protonation state of the  xxxd1771xxx  cofactor
formed during primary turnover,  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme was
formed by incubation of methylcobalamin enzyme with 1
equiv of homocysteine and was then oxidized to cob(ii)alamin enzyme in the presence of phenol red by slow addition
of potassium ferricyanide. absorbance changes at 480 nm
indicated that addition of 18 µm potassium ferricyanide led
to oxidation of ∼15 µm  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme (figure 8a).
this oxidation was accompanied by a decrease in absorbance
at 558 nm that suggested the release of 0.73 equiv of protons
into solution. the changes in the spectrum after addition of
1 equiv of potassium ferricyanide (figure 8b, circles) were
modeled using known spectra of wild-type  xxxd1771xxx  and
cob(ii)alamin enzyme and of protonated and deprotonated
phenol red. the best fit is obtained assuming stoichiometric
proton release accompanies oxidation of  xxxd1771xxx  to cob(ii)alamin (solid curve).
photolysis of methylcobalamin enzyme is not associated
with changes in the protonation state of the enzyme.
formation of  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme from either methylcobalamin or cob(ii)alamin enzyme is associated with proton
uptake, and we have hypothesized that this proton is taken
up within the his759-asp757 pair upon dissociation of
his759 from the cobalt. this model predicts that the
6-coordinate methylcobalamin enzyme and the 5-coordinate
cob(ii)alamin enzyme should have the same net protonation
state, since both enzyme forms have his759 coordinated to
the cobalt. to confirm this, we photolyzed methylcobalamin
enzyme in the presence of tempo and phenol red. tempo
contains a  xxxd2738xxx  and is able to trap the methyl
radical generated by photolysis, as shown in eqs 4 and 5,
with no net change in protonation of either species. changes

methylcobalamin enzyme is titrated with 1 equiv of homocysteine

(a) the addition of 18 µm k3fe(cn)6 (dashed vertical line) results

∆h+/cob(ii)alamin ) 0.73. (b) the difference spectrum generated

(s). for comparison, predicted difference spectra are shown for
release of two protons (- - - -) and for no net change in proton
stoichiometry (- - - -).

presence of phenol red are shown in figure 9 (upper panel).
we are able to accurately model the spectral changes
assuming no change in protonation of the enzyme, confirming that 6-coordinate methylcobalamin enzyme and 5-coordinate cob(ii)alamin enzyme have similar net protonation
states.
the asp757glu mutation was shown above to completely
abolish the ph dependence of reduction of cob(ii)alamin
enzyme to  xxxd1771xxx  (figure 3). this could be due to
the fact that the asp757glu enzyme is primarily 4-coordinate
in the cob(ii)alamin state (18) and, therefore, may already
be protonated in the cob(ii)alamin state. if this were the
case, conversion of methylcobalamin enzyme to cob(ii)alamin enzyme would be expected to be accompanied by
uptake of a proton by the protein. alternatively, the mutation
of asp757 to the larger glu residue may have caused a
structural change which abolished the ability to protonate
and deprotonate his759 when this residue dissociates from
or associates with the cobalamin cofactor (figure 10). if
this were the case, then all oxidation states of the asp757glu
enzyme would have the same protonation state, and dissociation of his759 from the cobalt upon conversion of
6-coordinate methylcobalamin enzyme to 4-coordinate cob(ii)alamin enzyme would be expected to be accompanied
by no uptake or release of a proton by the protein (figure

10). we photolyzed asp757glu methylcobalamin enzyme
to 4-coordinate cob(ii)alamin enzyme in the presence of
tempo and phenol red, in a manner similar to that described
above for the wild-type enzyme. changes in the spectra
accompanying photolysis (figure 9, lower panel) are accurately modeled assuming no change in the protonation state
of the asp757glu enzyme upon conversion from the
6-coordinate methylcobalamin enzyme to the 4-coordinate
cob(ii)alamin enzyme. these results suggest that all forms
of the asp757glu enzyme have a similar net protonation
state.
discussion
methionine biosynthesis requires the transfer of a methyl
group from ch3-h4folate to homocysteine; at neutral ph,
the uncatalyzed reaction involves transfer of a methyl group
from a tertiary amine to a protonated thiol. the enzyme
presumably activates the nucleophile by deprotonation of
homocysteine to the thiolate anion [pka ) 10.0 (1)] and may
activate the leaving group by protonation of ch3-h4folate
to the quaternary amine [pka ) 5.2 (29)]. we have observed
that binding homocysteine to the enzyme results in the rapid
release of 1 equiv of protons into solution, suggesting that
the enzyme selectively binds the homocysteine thiolate anion.
one possible strategy for selective binding of the homocysteine thiolate anion would be coordination of the sulfur to a
metal. in the accompanying paper, goulding and matthews
report that the overexpressed enzyme from e. coli contains
one equiv of tightly bound zinc that is essential for binding
homocysteine to the n-terminal substrate binding region (27).

15746 biochemistry, vol. 36, no. 50, 1997

figure 10: scheme describing proposed changes in protonation
of the his759-asp757 pair accompanying dissociation of his759
during photolysis or methylcobalamin enzyme or reduction of cob(ii)alamin enzyme. photolysis of wild-type methylcobalamin
enzyme to form 5-coordinate cob(ii)alamin does not involve uptake
or release of protons, while reduction of the wild-type cob(ii)alamin
enzyme to  xxxd1771xxx  is accompanied by dissociation of his759
and proton uptake through the asp757-ser810 hydrogen bonded
network. photolysis of the asp757glu mutant enzyme is accompanied by dissociation of his759 and formation of 4-coordinate
cob(ii)alamin enzyme, but without proton uptake by the enzyme.
we propose that the asp757glu mutation may have disrupted the
hydrogen bond between his759 and the carboxylate and that the
histidine residue is protonated in both the 6- and 4-coordinate
enzyme. the charge state of glu757 is not determined by these
experiments, as indicated by (h).

the origin of the proton that is destined for n5 of h4folate remains unresolved by this study. measurements of
the binding of ch3-h4folate to the inactive cob(ii)alamin
and active methylcobalamin forms of the enzyme in the
presence of phenol red suggest that a proton is not taken up
upon formation of the enzyme:ch3-h4folate complex. since
homocysteine binding in the presence of ch3-h4folate is
accompanied by proton release, and yet a complete turnover
cycle involves no net change in proton concentration, the
proton destined for n5 of h4folate must be either already
bound to the free methylcobalamin enzyme or taken up at a
very late stage in each turnover cycle. the precise mechanism of this protonation event must await additional
structural information.
methyl transfer from the methylcobalamin cofactor to the
bound homocysteine thiolate results in the formation of  xxxd1771xxx  as a transient intermediate in steady state turnover.
the cobalt of enzyme-bound methylcobalamin exhibits
6-coordinate (octahedral) ligation with the methyl group
serving as the upper axial ligand, four equatorial nitrogen
ligands provided by the corrin macrocycle, and n of his759
as the lower axial ligand (6). cobalt in  xxxd1771xxx  cofactor
prefers planar 4-coordinate planar coordination geometry (5)
provided by the four nitrogens of the corrin macrocycle. the
enzyme must therefore dissociate and stabilize the lower axial
histidine ligand upon conversion of methylcobalamin enzyme
to  xxxd1771xxx . reduction of 5-coordinate cob(ii)alamin

jarrett et al.
enzyme to 4-coordinate  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme during the
reductive methylation of oxidized enzyme also requires
dissociation of the lower axial histidine ligand (figure 1).
it has been reported that the reduction of cob(ii)alamin
enzyme to  xxxd1771xxx  is coupled with the uptake of one
proton by the enzyme (19), resulting in a midpoint potential
for the  xxxd1771xxx /cob(ii)alamin couple that is ph dependent over the range where the enzyme is stable (ph 6.58.0). mutation of asp757 to glu abolishes this ph dependence, suggesting that the proton taken up by the wild-type
enzyme resides within the his759-asp757 pair. it has also
been reported that binding the in vivo reductant, flavodoxin,
to the 5-coordinate cob(ii)alamin enzyme is coupled with a
conformational change that leads to formation of the
4-coordinate cob(ii)alamin enzyme and that the formation
of the flavodoxin: xxxg1479xxx  complex is coupled
with the uptake of one proton from solution (30). again,
the mutation asp757glu abolishes the ph dependence of
flavodoxin association (30), suggesting that the proton taken
up by the wild-type enzyme when flavodoxin binds resides
within the his759-asp757 pair. these reactions share
common features: reduction of cob(ii)alamin enzyme and
binding flavodoxin to cob(ii)alamin enzyme both require
formation of a 4-coordinate cobalamin cofactor, and both
reactions are apparently coupled with protonation of the
his759-asp757 pair.
although the conversion of methylcobalamin cofactor to
 xxxd1771xxx  during the primary turnover cycle (figure 1)
was also be expected to be coupled to protonation of the
his759-asp757 pair, several factors made it experimentally
difficult to establish proton uptake or release during this
primary turnover cycle. the experiments cited above
established proton uptake by measuring a shift in an
equilibrium constant as a function of ph; however, the
formation of the  xxxd1771xxx  cofactor during turnover is
coupled with the formation of a very stable carbon-sulfur
bond in the product methionine and is therefore irreversible.
we resorted to the direct detection of proton uptake or release
using the ph indicator dye phenol red, observing spectral
changes that suggest a proton is also taken up upon
conversion of methylcobalamin enzyme to  xxxd1771xxx 
(figures 6 and 7). this proton is taken up at a rate which
is kinetically competent for involvement in the primary
turnover cycle (figure 7). thus, the known forms of
 xxxg1479xxx  with 4-coordinate cobalamin cofactors,
including  xxxd1771xxx  generated by demethylation of methylcobalamin enzyme,  xxxd1771xxx  generated by reduction
of cob(ii)alamin enzyme, and cob(ii)alamin within the
flavodoxin: xxxg1479xxx  complex, share the common
feature of proton uptake within the his759-asp757-ser810
triad.
this proton uptake appears to be an important feature of
 xxxg1479xxx  that has been
preserved during evolution; the known sequences of  xxxg1479xxx , ranging from prokaryotes to humans, all
feature the conserved his-asp-ser triad as part of the b12binding domain. the thermodynamic benefit of proton
uptake for the formation of  xxxd1771xxx  is apparent from
model studies of the ph-dependent electrochemistry of
cobalamins conducted by saveant and co-workers (5, 31).
the reduction of free cob(ii)alamin to  xxxd1771xxx  requires
a very low-potential electron [em7 ) -610 mv vs she (31)].
part of this thermodynamic barrier is due to the energy

proton uptake and release in  xxxg1479xxx 

figure 11: binding the cobalamin cofactor to  xxxg1479xxx 
alters the ph profile of the midpoint potential for the cob(ii)alamin/
 xxxd1771xxx  couple. at ph values above 4.9, the free cob(ii)alamin
cofactor (- - - -) requires a very low potential electron (em ) -610
mv) for reduction to  xxxd1771xxx ; however, below ph 2.9 this
potential is raised due to protonation and dissociation of the
dimethylbenzimidazole ligand (31). between ph 2.9 and 4.7, the
midpoint potential exhibits ph dependence. binding cob(ii)alamin
to the enzyme (s) results in an increase in the overall midpoint
potential by ∼64 mv, and replacement of dimethylbenzimidazole
by the his759-asp757-ser810 triad results in a shift in the phdependent segment into the physiological range. the solid line
represents the experimentally derived curve from figure 3, while
the dashed lines represent hypothetical extensions of this curve to
low and high ph.

required to dissociate the lower axial dimethylbenzimidazole
ligand; at ph values below 2.9, where the dimethylbenzimidazole ligand is already dissociated and protonated,
reduction of cob(ii)alamin to  xxxd1771xxx  occurs with an
em of -500 mv.
binding cobalamin to  xxxg1479xxx  is associated
with two factors that act to raise the midpoint potential
associated with reduction of enzyme-bound cob(ii)alamin
(figure 11). first, reduction of free 5-coordinate cob(ii)alamin to 4-coordinate  xxxd1771xxx  is ph dependent over
the narrow range from 2.9-4.7 (figure 11); over the
physiologic ph range the midpoint potential is invariant at
-610 mv (31). replacement of dimethylbenzimidazole with
the his-asp-ser triad shifts the ph-dependent segment of
the cob(ii)alamin/ xxxd1771xxx  couple into the physiological
ph range (figure 11). second, binding cob(ii)alamin to
 xxxg1479xxx  raises the overall redox potential for
reduction of the 4-coordinate cob(ii)alamin to  xxxd1771xxx 
by ∼64 mv [from -500 mv in the free cofactor (31) to
-436 mv in the bound cofactor at ph <6 (figure 11)]. we
have estimated the ph-independent value of -436 mv for
the wild-type enzyme from the value obtained for the
asp757glu mutant enzyme. this conservative mutation,
which is thought to perturb the hydrogen bond between
his759 and asp757, results in cob(ii)alamin enzyme that is
predominantly 4-coordinate throughout the physiological ph
range (18). the combined effects of the shift in pk values
for the bound and unbound lower axial ligand and the overall
shift in the redox potential associated with binding cob(ii)alamin to the enzyme raise the redox potential for the cob(ii)alamin/ xxxd1771xxx  couple from -610 mv for the free
cofactor to -490 mv for the enzyme-bound cofactor at ph
7.
in addition to these thermodynamic benefits, protonation
and dissociation of his759 may also lead to accelerated
electron transfer rates during reductive methylation of cob(ii)alamin enzyme. binding flavodoxin to cob(ii)alamin

biochemistry, vol. 36, no. 50, 1997 15747
 xxxg1479xxx  leads to dissociation of his759 from
the cobalt, protonation of the his759-asp757 pair, and
formation of a 4-coordinate cob(ii)alamin enzyme that has
a similar coordination geometry to  xxxd1771xxx  enzyme (30).
marcus theory predicts that preorganization of the metal
center to more closely resemble the product will lead to faster
electron transfer from reduced flavodoxin to the cobalt due
to a decrease in the nuclear reorganization that must
accompany the electron transfer step (32). since the driving
force for electron transfer from flavodoxin to cob(ii)alamin
is low [∆em7 ) +40 mv (30)], nuclear preorganization may
be critical in accelerating the overall rate of electron transfer.
upon considering that a weak lower axial cobalt ligand
appears to offer significant thermodynamic and kinetic
advantages during reduction of cob(ii)alamin enzyme, one
might question whether nature should have evolved  xxxg1479xxx  to more closely resemble the asp757glu
mutant. proton uptake observed upon conversion of methylcobalamin enzyme to  xxxd1771xxx  appears to be relatively
unimportant for the chemical events of methionine biosynthesis since the mutation asp757glu results in a relatively
modest 3-fold decrease in the rate of methyl transfer from
methylcobalamin to homocysteine (18). however, the
asp757glu mutant is ∼20-30 fold impaired in overall
steady state activity (17, 18), primarily due to an uncharacterized kinetic step that we loosely attribute to conformational
changes associated with product release. the strength of
the coordination of his759 to the cobalt appears to be tuned
to balance the thermodynamic and kinetic benefits of ligand
dissociation accompanying  xxxd1771xxx  formation during
reductive methylation with the apparent importance of the
his759-asp757 pair in triggering product release during
primary turnover.
