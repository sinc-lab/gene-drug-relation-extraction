abstract
the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1946xxx , a unique progestogen, are reviewed in this paper. unlike other progestogens,
 xxxd1946xxx , an analogue of spironolactone, has biochemical and pharmacologic profiles similar to endogenous progesterone, especially
regarding antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activities.  xxxd1946xxx  counteracts the estrogen-induced stimulation of the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system and blocks testosterone from binding to androgen receptors. because of these characteristics, it has the
potential to reduce body weight, blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein levels and to enhance high-density lipoprotein levels. as a
combination oral contraceptive,  xxxd1946xxx  with  xxxd2054xxx  is effective and has positive effects on weight and lipid levels.
additionally, it relieves menstrually related symptoms (e.g., negative affect and water retention) that are commonly observed with other
combination oral contraceptives. based on the biochemical and pharmacodynamic data,  xxxd1946xxx  appears to be a viable alternative to
the currently available progestogens. © 2000 elsevier science inc. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
improving the safety and tolerability of oral contraceptives (ocs) without affecting efficacy has been a
major research goal for over 20 years. developing new
progestogens has been considered one means of achieving this goal [1,2]. ideally, a progestogen should have a
pharmacologic profile similar to progesterone. currently
available progestogens are structurally related to either
19-nortestosterone (e.g.,  xxxd2751xxx ,  xxxd2751xxx 
acetate, levonorgestrel, gestodene,  xxxd1849xxx ,  xxxd2753xxx , and dienogest) or 17␣- xxxd2303xxx  (e.g.,
 xxxd2554xxx ,  xxxd2557xxx , chlormadinone acetate, and  xxxd1786xxx ) [3.4]. while
some of these agents have antiandrogenic properties
(e.g., dienogest,  xxxd1786xxx ,  xxxd2557xxx ,
and chlormadinone acetate), they all lack antimineralocorticoid activity when used in clinically relevant dosages [3,5,6]. adverse effects associated with ocs con-

taining these progestogens may be due, in part, to the
absence of these specific antihormone characteristics
[1,7–9]. these effects include breast tenderness, weight
gain, increased blood pressure (bp), and mood swings.
adverse effects such as these are the major reason why
women discontinue the use of ocs [8].
 xxxd1946xxx  is an analogue of the aldosterone antagonist, spironolactone, and is a unique progestogen [10].
the pharmacologic profile of  xxxd1946xxx  is more
closely related to that of progesterone, especially with
regard to antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activities, than that of any other synthetic progestogen [11–
14]. this suggests that adverse effects commonly observed with combination ocs may be decreased with an
oc containing  xxxd1946xxx . in a recent study, the contraceptive efficacy and adverse effects of  xxxd1946xxx /
 xxxd2054xxx  combination treatment were evaluated
with favorable results [2].
the purpose of this article is to review the distinctive
biochemical and pharmacologic characteristics and pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1946xxx . in addition, contraceptive efficacy and the potential health benefits beyond contraception
associated with  xxxd1946xxx / xxxd2054xxx  will be
discussed.

2. biochemistry
 xxxd1946xxx  (6␤,7␤,15␤,16␤-dimethylene-3-oxo-17␣pregn-4-ene-21, xxxd1946xxx ) is an analogue of the antimineralocorticoid spironolactone (fig. 1) that is synthesized from  xxxd2996xxx  [10,15,16]. a comprehensive,
comparative biochemical characterization of  xxxd1946xxx 
and progesterone examined their interaction with a series of
classical steroid hormone receptors such as the progesterone, androgen, glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and estrogen receptors [10]. the relative binding affinities of  xxxd1946xxx  and progesterone to these receptors were
determined using cytosol fractions containing the expression vector for the respective animal (rat or rabbit) [10] or
human steroid receptor. (data on file, schering ag, berlin,
germany.) the radiolabeled reference compounds for the
progesterone, androgen, mineralocorticoid, glucocorticoid,
and estrogen receptors were progesterone, methyltrienolone, aldosterone, dexamethasone, and estradiol, respectively, in both the human and animal receptor binding as-

says. relative binding affinity values of these reference
compounds were arbitrarily set at 100%. results of both the
animal and human steroid receptor binding assays are summarized in table 1. of note, (1)  xxxd1946xxx  demonstrated
a relative binding affinities of 19% to the human and 40% to
the rabbit  xxxg1737xxx ; (2)  xxxd1946xxx  and progesterone have high relative binding affinities for the  xxxg1602xxx  (500% and 1000% for the human
receptor for  xxxd1946xxx  and progesterone, respectively;
both 100% for the rat receptor); (3) both progestogens have
ⱕ3% relative binding affinity to the  xxxg183xxx  in all
models; (4)  xxxd1946xxx  exhibits a low relative binding
affinity to the  xxxg1601xxx  (1% and 3% for the
animal and human receptor, respectively), whereas progesterone has some binding affinity to this receptor (11% and
35% for the animal and human receptor, respectively); and
(5) neither  xxxd1946xxx  nor progesterone demonstrate significant binding to the  xxxg730xxx  [10]. (data on file,
schering ag, berlin, germany.) in contrast, other progestogens such as gestodene,  xxxd2067xxx  (active metab-

were progesterone, methyltrienolone, aldosterone, dexamethasone, and estradiol, respectively in both the human and animal receptor binding assays. rba

olite of  xxxd1849xxx ), and levonorgestrel have different receptor-binding profiles than  xxxd1946xxx  and progesterone
[17]. all three progestogens have demonstrated higher binding affinities to both the progesterone and  xxxg183xxx 
than progesterone or  xxxd1946xxx . additionally, levonorgestrel and  xxxd2067xxx  have lower binding affinities to
the  xxxg1602xxx  than either progesterone or
 xxxd1946xxx , whereas gestodene has a greater binding affinity to this receptor than progesterone or  xxxd1946xxx .
the effects of  xxxd1946xxx  and progesterone on androgen-, glucocorticoid-, and mineralocorticoid-receptor–mediated induction of transcription were also evaluated using
in vitro transactivation assays [10]. these assays were performed in cv-1 cells transfected with either androgen or
glucocorticoid receptors and a reporter plasmid containing
mouse mammary tumor promotor virus or cos 1 cells
transfected with  xxxg1602xxx  and the identical
viral promotor [10]. the results showed that (1)  xxxd1946xxx  and progesterone inhibit aldosterone-induced
mineralocorticoid activity and weakly induce reporter gene
transcription on their own; (2) both progestogens have no
androgenic activity but display antiandrogenic activity in
terms of inhibition of androgen-receptor–mediated transcription in a dose-dependent manner [10]. the receptormediated inhibition of transcription reflects that dro-

spirenone has antiandrogenic activity which is explained by
competitive binding to the  xxxg183xxx  and is intrinsic
to its molecular structure; this direct antiantiandrogenic effect is in addition to the more indirect antiandrogenic effect
of progestogens in general, that is mainly explained by the
suppression of androgen production from the adrenals or
ovaries.  xxxd1946xxx  shows no glucocorticoid and antiglucocorticoid activity, whereas progesterone exhibits weak
glucocorticoid-receptor–mediated agonistic activity but not
antagonist activity [10]. overall, the results from the steroid-binding and transactivation assays demonstrate that the
biochemical profile of  xxxd1946xxx  is similar to that of
progesterone, especially regarding its antimineralocorticoid
and antiandrogenic activities [10]. this profile distinguishes
 xxxd1946xxx  from other synthetic progestogens currently
used in ocs (table 2) [5,6,18].

3. pharmacology and bioactivity
the progestational activity of  xxxd1946xxx  has been
analyzed by evaluating its antigonadotropic and endometrium-transforming capabilities [11,14]. in male cynomolgus
monkeys treated with  xxxd1946xxx  4 mg/kg/day (orally
[p.o.]) on days 5, 7, 10, 12, and 14,  xxxd1946xxx  showed a

strong antigonadotropic effect by significantly reducing luteinizing hormone levels compared to the pretreatment
phase [11,14]. additionally, endometrial transformation
tests using ovariectomized rabbits initially treated for 6
consecutive days with estradiol (5 ␮g/animal; subcutaneously [s.c.] or p.o.) and followed by a 5-day treatment of
 xxxd1946xxx  (range, 0.1 to 1.0 mg/animal; s.c. or p.o.)
demonstrated marked endometrial transformation at a daily
dosage of  xxxd1946xxx  0.3 mg/animal [11,14]. the threshold dose for endometrial reactions (mcphail value of 1.5)
occurred in the dose range of 0.1 to 0.3 mg/animal (s.c.)
[11,14]. the results from these animal models are consistent
with results from receptor-binding assays and demonstrate
that  xxxd1946xxx  has progestogenic activity.
inhibition of ovulation by  xxxd1946xxx  alone or in combination with  xxxd2054xxx  30 ␮g has been demonstrated
in humans [19]. patients had documented normal ovulatory
function in their pretreatment cycle.  xxxd1946xxx  alone
was assessed over 3 treatment cycles in 48 women randomized to dosages of 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 mg in a dose ranging
study. dose-dependant efficacy in ovarian suppression was
shown. incidence of ovarian ripening was 9% and 42% in 3
mg and 2 mg  xxxd1946xxx  groups, respectively. incidence
of complete ovarian suppression was 91% and 50% in the 3
mg and 2 mg groups, respectively. all subjects in the 3 mg
group were anovulatory, whereas 1 patient in each of the
lower dosage groups ovulated. efficacy in ovulation inhibition of  xxxd1946xxx  2 mg or 3 mg combined with ethinyl
estradiol 30 ␮g was assessed in 52 women over 3 treatment
cycles. mean values of luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, 17␤-estradiol and progesterone serum levels were suppressed during all treatment cycles with the
combination of  xxxd1946xxx  2 mg or 3 mg and ethinyl
estradiol 30 ␮g, compared to pre- and post-treatment cycles.
in the 2 mg group, escape ovulation occurred in 1 cycle for
each of three patients; complete inhibition of ovulation was
observed in 57 of 69 cycles. in the 3 mg group, none of the
women ovulated and complete ovulation inhibition was
observed in 62 of 69 cycles.
the effect of  xxxd1946xxx  on factors influenced by mineralocorticoid activity [e.g., electrolyte and water balance,
weight, and blood pressure (bp)] was examined in animal
models and humans. ovariectomized rats fed on a lowsodium diet treated with  xxxd1946xxx  or spironolactone
(each, 1 to 10 mg/animal/day) were evaluated for sodium
and potassium excretion [11,14].  xxxd1946xxx  was more
effective than spironolactone in increasing the na⫹/k⫹ excretion rate and was shown to be a long-term antimineralocorticoid, as a dosage of 10 mg/animal/day produced a
sustained stimulation of this electrolyte excretion ratio [11].
similar studies have shown that progestogens like levonorgestrel,  xxxd2751xxx  acetate,  xxxd2067xxx , and
 xxxd1786xxx  have neither antimineralocorticoid activity nor mineralocorticoid activity. gestodene, however, is
devoid of mineralocorticoid activity but has a rather low

antimineralocorticoid activity, which is not considered clinically relevant in contraceptive dosages [13].
young women on a constant moderately low sodium and
potassium diet were treated with  xxxd1946xxx  2 mg from
day 8 to day 13 of their menstrual cycle and evaluated for
sodium and potassium excretion [12]. those on  xxxd1946xxx  had greater sodium excretion than women treated
with placebo, except for the third day of treatment; the
potassium excretion did not differ between the two groups.
sodium excretion in the  xxxd1946xxx -treated group rose
from a mean of 79.6 to 98.6 mmol na⫹/day during drug
treatment. the difference between average sodium excretion rates of women treated with  xxxd1946xxx  and placebo
was close to significance (98.6 mmole/24 h and 81.8
mmole/24 h, respectively; p ⫽ 0.053). weight loss was
slightly greater with  xxxd1946xxx  treatment than placebo
treatment [12].  xxxd1946xxx  also significantly increased
plasma renin activity and plasma and urinary aldosterone
during treatment [12].
a rise in sodium excretion, plasma renin activity, and
plasma and urinary aldosterone levels has been noted during
the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. these effects are
thought to be due to the antimineralocorticoid activity of
progesterone [12]. a dosage of  xxxd1946xxx  2 mg administered to normal, healthy menstruating women from day 5
to day 25 inhibited ovulation and prevented the rise in
progesterone [12]. in contrast to  xxxd1786xxx , a progestogen with no antimineralocorticoid activity,  xxxd1946xxx  induced natriuresis and increased plasma renin
activity and aldosterone levels during the follicular phase of
the menstrual cycle compared to that of the untreated control cycle (fig. 2). preliminary studies have demonstrated
that  xxxd1946xxx  (2 or 4 mg/day) in combination with
 xxxd2054xxx  (30 ␮g/day) increases urinary sodium excretion, which is, however, compensated for by increases in
plasma aldosterone and  xxxg99xxx  levels throughout the
menstrual cycle [20]. the natriuresis and rise in plasma
renin activity and plasma and urinary aldosterone levels
induced by  xxxd1946xxx  in the follicular phase is similar to
that induced by progesterone in the luteal phase of the
menstrual cycle [3,12].
 xxxd1946xxx  has been shown to have no clinically significant effects on bp in animal and human studies. during
a 4-week treatment with  xxxd1946xxx  (2 mg/day), bp did
not change in spontaneously hypertensive male rats,
whereas equipotent doses of levonorgestrel and cyproterone
acetate increased bp in these animals [21]. similarly,  xxxd1946xxx  had only a slight effect on systolic bp and no
effects on diastolic bp in normotensive female rats [22]. bp
and body weight were also evaluated in normal, healthy
women who received either  xxxd1946xxx  3 mg with varying
doses of  xxxd2054xxx  (15, 20, and 30 ␮g) or levonorgestrel 150 ␮g with  xxxd2054xxx  30 ␮g for 6 months
[16]. drugs were taken from day 1 to day 21 of the menstrual cycle, followed by a pill-free interval of 7 days.

cycle, the mean body weight decreased by 0.8 to 1.7 kg in
the  xxxd1946xxx / xxxd2054xxx -treated groups, whereas it
increased 0.7 kg in the levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradioltreated group. the differences in the body weight change of
the  xxxd1946xxx / xxxd2054xxx -treated groups compared

to that of the levonorgestrel/ xxxd2054xxx -treated group
were significant (all, p ⬍0.05) [16]. in addition, systolic and
diastolic bp decreased by 1 to 4 mm hg in groups treated
with  xxxd1946xxx  and  xxxd2054xxx , whereas it increased by 1 to 2 mm hg in the group treated with  xxxd2750xxx -

gestrel and  xxxd2054xxx . the change in systolic pressure
in the group treated with  xxxd1946xxx  3 mg and ethinyl
estradiol 15 ␮g, and the changes in the diastolic pressures in
the groups treated with  xxxd1946xxx  3 mg and ethinyl
estradiol, either 15 or 30 ␮g, were significantly different
from the corresponding changes in the levonorgestrel/ xxxd2054xxx -treated group (all, p ⬍0.05) [16]. overall, the
results from these in vivo studies clearly show that the data
from the receptor-binding and transactivation assays translate into antimineralocorticoid activity of  xxxd1946xxx  in
animals and humans.
the effect of  xxxd1946xxx  on factors influenced by androgenic activity was examined in animal models and humans. animal studies demonstrated that  xxxd1946xxx  has
antiandrogenic activity in terms of its effects on the growth
of accessory sex glands in androgen-treated juvenile castrated rats.  xxxd1946xxx  at dosages ranging from 0.1 to 10
mg/animal/day (s.c.) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of
the growth of both seminal vesicles and the prostate upon 7
days’ application [10,11,14], similar effects were seen with
progesterone at dosages ranging from 0.3 to 30 mg/animal/
day (s.c.) [10].
it has been demonstrated that combined oral contraceptives reduce ovarian and adrenal production of testosterone
and its precursors both by direct inhibition of enzymes
involved in their biosynthesis and indirectly through suppression of gonadotropin secretion [18,23]. slight reduction
of ovarian androgen production has also been shown with
the combination of  xxxd1946xxx  and  xxxd2054xxx  in
normal healthy women. (data on file, schering, ag, berlin,
germany.)
an antiandrogenic effect has also been observed in
women administered  xxxd1946xxx  3 mg with  xxxd2054xxx  (15 to 30 ␮g) [16]. these combination treatments
produced increases in high-density cholesterol levels
(range, 9% to 23%) and triglyceride levels (range, 47% to
73%) above baseline compared to levonorgestrel 150 ␮g
and  xxxd2054xxx  30 ␮g treatment (12% and unchanged
from baseline, respectively). the differences in high-density
cholesterol and triglyceride levels with the  xxxd1946xxx 
combinations are significantly different from the corresponding changes with the levonorgestrel combination (all,
p ⬍0.05). conversely,  xxxd1946xxx / xxxd2054xxx  treatment decreases low-density cholesterol levels below baseline level (14% to 20%) compared to levonorgestrel/ethinyl
estradiol treatment, which had no effect. the results from
these studies involving both animals and humans support
previous data obtained with receptor-binding and transactivation assays that show  xxxd1946xxx  has antiandrogenic
activity.

4. pharmacokinetics
 xxxd1946xxx  was initially detected and identified during
pharmacokinetic studies of spirorenone in the monkey [26].

subsequent pharmacokinetic studies of  xxxd1946xxx  in man
demonstrated that its absorption is rapid and complete, with
peak plasma concentrations of  xxxd1946xxx  occurring
within 1 to 2 hours after oral administration. (data on file,
berlex laboratories, wayne, nj, usa.) the absolute bioavailability of  xxxd1946xxx  after oral administration to
young, healthy women was on average 76%. there is a
linear relationship between the dose of  xxxd1946xxx  (range,
1 to 10 mg) and the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1946xxx .
steady-state is achieved after about 7 daily administrations
of  xxxd1946xxx  3 mg in combination with  xxxd2054xxx 
30 ␮g. the average maximum  xxxd1946xxx  plasma concentration ranges between 60 and 87 ng/ml, and the mean
 xxxd1946xxx  trough level ranges between 20 and 25 ng/ml.
plasma levels of  xxxd1946xxx  decline biphasically. after
oral administration the mean half-lives are about 2 hours for
the distribution phase and range from 25 to 33 hours for the
disposition phase. approximately 95% to 97% of  xxxd1946xxx  is bound to serum protein, thought to be albumin.
 xxxd1946xxx  does not bind to sex-hormone-binding globulin or corticosteroid-binding globulin and does not attenuate the  xxxd2054xxx  induced increase in these proteins.
following oral or intravenous administrations,  xxxd1946xxx  is extensively metabolized. the major plasma
metabolites of  xxxd1946xxx  are the acid form of  xxxd1946xxx  generated by the opening of the lactone ring and
the 4,5-dihydro- xxxd1946xxx -3-sulfate (fig. 1). the major
metabolites are generated independently of the cytochrome
p450 enzyme system. excretion of  xxxd1946xxx  is nearly
complete after 10 days with trace amounts of  xxxd1946xxx 
excreted unchanged in urine and feces. at least 20 different
metabolites are observed in urine and feces. less than 10%
of the metabolites in urine are freely extractable, while
about 38% to 47% are excreted as glucuronide and sulfate
conjugates. in feces, about one-third of the metabolites are
freely extractable and about 17% to 20% are excreted as
glucuronides and sulfates.

5. a new oc with  xxxd1946xxx 
recently yasmin (berlex laboratories, wayne, nj,
usa), a new low-dose oc tablet containing  xxxd1946xxx  3
mg and  xxxd2054xxx  30 ␮g, was evaluated in a yearlong, open-label, multicenter study for contraceptive efficacy and safety [2]. the results showed yasmin is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated oc. one pregnancy
occurred in 3201 cycles of 326 subjects; this subject reported 1 intake error. after correcting for cycles without
recorded use of other contraceptives (3192 cycles), the pearl
index was 0.4. the pregnancy ratio was 0.46 since 1 pregnancy occurred among the 220 subjects completing 13 cycles without using alternative contraception. no serious
adverse events related to the contraceptive occurred. additionally, 71% of subjects (230/326) reported at least one
adverse event during the study, and 6% of subjects (20/326)

discontinued the study because of adverse effects. emotional lability, headache, nausea, dysmenorrhea, intermenstrual bleeding, and depression, that occurred at frequencies

of 1.5% or less, were the most frequently reported adverse
events cited for discontinuation. the incidence of these
adverse events is comparable to that of other low-dose

r. krattenmacher / contraception 62 (2000) 29 –38

combination ocs; the antimineralocorticoid actions of  xxxd1946xxx  would not be expected to impact the occurrence
of these particular side effects [2].
during the same open-label study, the menstrual distress
questionnaire [27] was adapted and used to assess menstrually related symptoms such as impaired concentration, negative affect, water retention, increased appetite, feelings of
well-being, and undesirable hair change during three phases
of the menstrual cycle (i.e., premenstrual, 4 days prior to
menstruation; menstrual, first through the last day of menstruation; and postmenstrual, remainder of the cycle) [2].
for water retention and negative affect, there was a statistically significant decrease from baseline to cycle 6 for all
subjects in all phases of the menstrual cycle (fig. 3). the
severity level of increased appetite was significantly lower
at cycle 6 compared to baseline for all phases of the menstrual cycle, except the postmenstrual phase. there were no
significant changes for impaired concentration, undesirable
hair change, or feelings of well-being throughout the entire
menstrual cycle (fig. 3). overall,  xxxd1946xxx  has a favorable impact on the common menstrual cycle symptoms cited
above. these symptoms are often reported among patients
suffering from premenstrual syndrome.
effects of  xxxd1946xxx  and  xxxd2054xxx  on weight,
bp, and lipids were also assessed in this study [2]. there
was a trend toward weight loss in cycles 1, 3, and 9, whereas
significant weight loss occurred at cycle 6 (p ⫽ 0.025).
weight gain, however, was significant at cycle 13 (p ⫽
0.0319; fig. 4). during the study, bp remained within
normal limits and no significant changes from baseline in
mean systolic or diastolic bp occurred. finally, lipids also
remained within normal limits throughout the study, but
total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, and
the ratio of high-density lipoprotein to low-density lipoprotein showed significant increases from baseline at cycle 13
(p ⬍0.0001). thus,  xxxd1946xxx / xxxd2054xxx  oc has a
favorable profile with respect to weight and lipids [2].
estrogenic components of ocs can contribute to many of
their reported adverse effects [3]. estrogens such as ethinyl
estradiol, a common component of ocs, can stimulate the
synthesis of hepatic proteins such as sex-hormone-binding
globulin and  xxxg99xxx . high levels of  xxxg99xxx  can cause small increases in  xxxg99xxx , thereby
stimulating aldosterone secretion that in turn increases sodium reabsorption and water retention. by activation of the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system,  xxxd2054xxx  may
cause sodium retention, weight gain, and high bp in susceptible women. in the later half of the menstrual cycle,
progesterone has been shown to induce sodium loss and a
compensatory increase in renin secretion, plasma renin activity,  xxxg99xxx , and plasma aldosterone because it has
potent antimineralocorticoid activity. these effects counteract the estrogen-induced increase in sodium retention,
weight, and bp [3]. like progesterone,  xxxd1946xxx  is an
aldosterone antagonist and has demonstrated strong antimineralocorticoid activity by counteracting estrogen-in-

37

duced effects from the activation of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system. in contrast, other available combined
ocs contain progestogens without antimineralocorticoid activity and are frequently associated with adverse effects.

6. conclusions
the reviewed in vitro and in vivo animal studies show
that  xxxd1946xxx  is a unique progestogen which has a
biochemical and pharmacologic profile that closely resembles  xxxd3023xxx  [10]. unlike other currently available synthetic progestogens derived from 17␣- xxxd2303xxx  or 19-nortestosterone,  xxxd1946xxx  demonstrates
both antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activities
[11]. as such,  xxxd1946xxx  is a viable progestogenic alternative that may, in some cases, be preferable to other
choices. the actions of this unique progestogen in 3 physiologic pathways are summarized in fig. 5. first, the progestogenic action results in inhibition of ovulation [2,11,
14]. second, the antiandrogenic activity of  xxxd1946xxx 
could lead to suppression of unwanted symptoms such as
acne and hirsutism through blockade of androgenic receptors in the skin [6]. finally, the antimineralocorticoid activity of  xxxd1946xxx  balances the aldosterone-stimulating
mineralocorticoid effect of estrogens (e.g.,  xxxd2054xxx )
and may reduce estrogen-induced sodium and water retention. therefore, yasmin, an effective and safe low-dose oc
containing  xxxd1946xxx  and  xxxd2054xxx , provides
health benefits beyond contraception. these benefits include
a favorable impact on menstrually related symptoms (e.g.,
water retention and negative affect) and a favorable profile
with respect to skin, weight, and lipids.
