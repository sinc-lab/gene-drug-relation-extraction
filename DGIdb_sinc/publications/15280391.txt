nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs)1 are cys-loop ligand-gated ion channels formed by five polypeptide subunits
(1). typical features of cys-loop ligand-gated ion channels include an n-terminal extracellular domain where ligand binding
occurs and the cys-loop, which is two disulfide-bonded cys* this work was supported by grants from the medical research

teines separated by 13 residues and four transmembrane regions (m1– 4), the second of which contains many channellining residues (2). the nachr subunits possessing two
adjacent cysteines in the acetylcholine (ach) binding site are
referred to as ␣ subunits, whereas those with no such motif are
referred to as non-␣ subunits (␤, ␥, ␦, and ⑀). birds and mammals possess 17 subunits characterized as either “muscle” (␣1,
␤1, ␥, ␦, and ⑀) or “neuronal” (␣2–10, ␤2– 4) subtypes (3, 4).
recent analysis of the pufferfish genome has revealed a larger
nachr gene family consisting of 28 subunits that probably
arose through genome duplication (5). one of the most extensive and diverse nachr gene families currently known is that
of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans which consists of at
least 27 subunits (6).
early investigations identified c. elegans mutants resistant
to the anthelmintic drug levamisole, which causes paralysis of
nematode body wall muscles (7–9). among the 12 levamisoleresistant loci, it has been shown that lev-1 and unc-29 both
encode non-␣ nachr subunits, whereas unc-38 encodes a
nachr ␣ subunit (10). expression in xenopus laevis oocytes of
combinations of these subunits that include unc-38 resulted
in small amplitude, dose-dependent inward currents in response to ach and levamisole that were suppressed by several
nachr antagonists (10). more recently, electrophysiological
studies have shown that unc-29 and unc-38 are essential
components of the native levamisole-sensitive nachr at the
nematode neuromuscular junction (11).
four other genes mediating levamisole resistance have been
identified. these are: unc-22, the product of which is known as
twitchin (12); unc-50, which encodes for a novel transmembrane protein (13); unc-68, which encodes for a ryanodine receptor (14); and lev-11, which encodes for tropomyosin (15). the
characterization of the remaining levamisole-resistant loci
(unc-63, unc-74, lev-8, lev-9, and lev-10) have yet to be reported.
here we describe the cloning of a new nachr ␣ subunit and
show that it corresponds to the unc-63 locus (7, 8). green
fluorescent protein (gfp) reporter constructs reveal that
unc-63 is expressed in body wall muscles as well as neurons.
using electrophysiology on muscle preparations, we also show
that unc-63 is necessary for the function of the levamisolesensitive nachr at the neuromuscular junction.
experimental procedures

c. elegans strains and general methods—the handling of c. elegans
was performed as described by sulston and hodgkin (16). the following
strains were used: n2 wild type c. elegans (bristol variety), zz13
unc-63(x13) i, zz26 unc-63(x26) i, dh404 unc-63(b404), zz37 unc63(x37) i, zz1004 unc-63(x18) dpy-5(e61) i, and cb211 lev-1(e211) iv.

the anthelmintic drug levamisole causes hypercontraction of body wall muscles and lethality in nematode
worms. in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans, a genetic screen for levamisole resistance has identified 12
genes, three of which (unc-38, unc-29, and lev-1) encode
 xxxg456xxx  (nachr) subunits.
here we describe the molecular and functional characterization of another levamisole-resistant gene, unc-63,
encoding a nachr ␣ subunit with a predicted amino
acid sequence most similar to that of unc-38. like
unc-38 and unc-29, unc-63 is expressed in body wall
muscles. in addition, unc-63 is expressed in vulval muscles and neurons. we also show that lev-1 is expressed
in body wall muscle, thus overlapping the cellular localization of unc-63, unc-38, and unc-29 and suggesting
possible association in vivo. this is supported by electrophysiological studies on body wall muscle, which
demonstrate that a levamisole-sensitive nachr present
at the c. elegans neuromuscular junction requires both
unc-63 and lev-1 subunits. thus, at least four subunits,
two ␣ types (unc-38 and unc-63) and two non-␣ types
(unc-29 and lev-1), can contribute to levamisole-sensitive muscle nachrs in nematodes.

is shown with location of identified
changes found in unc-63 mutant alleles.

muscle cells were used for further studies on the phenotype of rescued
worms. three stable lines were obtained.
generation of unc-63::gfp and lev-1::gfp constructs—as indicated in fig. 4a, the unc-63::gfp fusion construct was made using the
expression vector ppd95.70 and a pcr product containing 4.5 kb upstream of the unc-63 start codon to part of exon 7 (the encoding part of
the large cytoplasmic loop). the primers used to amplify the unc-63
genomic fragment were: 5⬘-ttttggcccgggatgtgttgttggggatcg-3⬘ and 5⬘-tatttggcatgctctgtgactgcctatgg-3⬘. for the
lev-1::gfp construct, 9 kb of genomic dna, including 4 kb upstream
of the lev-1 start codon, was amplified using the primers 5⬘-agctcctcttccggccactcg-3⬘ and 5⬘-ttcagaaaataccaagaactgtgtcgttgg-3⬘ and then cloned into vector ppd95.79. the gfp was
fused in-frame with the c terminus of lev-1 (fig. 4a), removing the
two c-terminal amino acids of lev-1. the unc-63::gfp fusion construct (80 ␮g ml⫺1) was co-injected with plasmid prf4 (100 ␮g ml⫺1)
into wild type animals. transgenic animals were selected by their roller
phenotype (21). the lev-1::gfp fusion construct (50 – 80 ␮g ml⫺1) was
injected into the lev-1(e211) mutant. transgenic worms with gfp fluorescence were selected, and the animals were viewed by fluorescence
microscopy on a leica confocal system.
electrophysiology—whole-cell, voltage clamp recordings were obtained from the ventral medial body wall muscles of dissected c. elegans
adults, as described previously (11). an epc-9 patch clamp amplifier
(heka, lambrecht, germany) was deployed to record currents, which
were digitized at 2.9 khz using an it6 interface (instrutech, great
neck, new york). data acquisition was controlled by pulsefit software
(heka) run on a power mac 6500/255 computer. recordings were made
at a holding potential of ⫺60 mv. extracellular saline of the following
composition (in mm) was used: 150 nacl, 5 kcl, 5 cacl2, 4 mgcl2, 10
glucose, 5 sucrose, 15 hepes (ph 7.3, ⬃330 milliosmoles). the patch
pipette was filled with the following solution (in mm): 120 kcl, 20 koh,
4 mgcl2, 5 tes, 0.25 cacl2, 4 naatp, 36 sucrose, 5 egta (ph 7.2,
⬃315 milliosmolar). subsequent analysis and graphing were carried
out using pulsefit (heka) and igor pro (wavemetrics, lake oswego,
oregon). statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired t test
(for ach responses) or the mann whitney test (for levamisole responses
and dihydro-␤-erythroidine block). all statistically derived values are
given as mean ⫾ s.e.

containing 1 mm levamisole. locomotion was assessed by transferring
adult hermaphrodites to nematode growth media plates without levamisole and after 1 h, counting the number of body bends/min.
dna extraction and sequencing—cloning was carried out using
standard methods (17). the c. elegans genomic dna extraction protocol
was obtained from www.dartmouth.edu/artsci/bio/ambros/protocols/
worm_protocols.html. plasmid dna for micro-injection into nematodes
was purified using a qiagen plasmid mini kit (qiagen). sequencing was
performed at the babraham institute or at the oxford university biochemistry department sequencing facility.
cloning jtf#38 cdna—a mixed stage n2 cdna library in ␭gt10
(provided by s. kim) was hybridized with an unc-38 probe at 50 °c as
described previously (10). the final washes were carried out at moderate stringency (65 °c in 2⫻ ssc, 0.1% sds). sequence analysis revealed that one of the positive clones, jtf#38, contained a partial cdna
homologous to nachr subunits. the 5⬘ and 3⬘ ends of the jtf#38 coding
region was determined using the 5⬘/3⬘ race kit (roche diagnostics).
sequence analysis—sequence alignment and analysis were performed using clustalx. the blast alignment tool (18) was used to
search the genome data base.
genetic localization of the jtf#38 gene—the jtf#38 cdna was used to
probe an ordered grid of yeast artificial chromosomes (yacs) following
the protocol described by coulson et al. (19).
sequencing of mutant alleles—reverse transcriptase-pcr was performed to amplify unc-63 and lev-1 from mutant alleles, and the pcr
products were sequenced. after a putative mutation was found in the
cdna, the corresponding genomic fragment from the mutants was
amplified using single worm pcr (20) and sequenced.
germ line transformation—germ line transformation was performed according to the method of mello et al. (21).
mutant rescue experiment—we were unable to make a gfp construct consisting of the entire unc-63 coding region for both the rescue
of unc-63 mutants and localization of the unc-63 subunit. thus, for
mutant rescue studies, we used a construct (punc-63.1) that was generated by pcr on wild type genomic dna using the expand long
template system (roche applied science) and the primers 5⬘-tatttggcggccgctctgtgactgcctatgg-3⬘ and 5⬘-ggaagaggtaccatggcagaacacgtgatg-3⬘ (engineered restriction sites are underlined). the pcr product was cloned into the pgem-t plasmid
(promega), and the clones were subsequently checked using restriction
analysis and sequencing. the punc-63.1 construct contained a 12.5-kb
insert comprising 4.5 kb of 5⬘ upstream region, all of the genomic coding
region, and 1 kb of downstream 3⬘ sequence. germ line transformation
was performed by co-injecting the test dna (80 ␮g ml⫺1) and the
marker plasmid ppd93.65 (100 ␮g ml⫺1). injection of ppd93.65, which
contains the gfp gene under the control of the myosin heavy chain
unc-54 gene promoter, resulted in gfp expression in all body wall
muscle cells. transgenic animals with gfp fluorescence in body wall

eral positive clones were obtained, including one which hybridized specifically at moderate stringency to the unc-38 cdna
probe. the clone was a partial cdna, in which the amino acid
sequence showed significant identity with previously characterized nachr subunits. we utilized race pcr to complete
the cdna sequence, and the rna splice leader sl1 (22) was
observed at the 5⬘ end. the full-length cdna clone was designated jtf#38 (genbanktm accession number aak83056).
location of the jtf#38 clone on the c. elegans physical and
genetic maps—we mapped the location of jtf#38 to yacs
y55f5 and y72d6 on the physical map by hybridizing the
cloned cdna to a yac grid (fig. 1a). y55f5 and y72d6 are
located near the center of chromosome i. during the course of
this study, the genomic sequence of the region containing jtf#38
was completed by the c. elegans sequencing consortium (23).
we therefore compared the genomic region and the jtf#38
cdna sequences and found that jtf#38 corresponds to the predicted gene y110a7a.3, which encodes a putative nachr subunit. the gene is composed of 10 exons spanning 7.5 kb (fig.
1b). because y110a7a.3 lies close to the levamisole-resistant
locus unc-63, we investigated whether y110a7a.3 corresponds
to unc-63.

y110a7a.3 is the unc-63 locus—to test whether y110a7a.3
corresponds to unc-63, we first sequenced y110a7a.3 genomic
dna in five unc-63 mutant alleles. all mutant alleles were
isolated using ethyl methane-sulfonate mutagenesis (7). the
unc-63 mutants exhibited a range of phenotypes from strongly
uncoordinated locomotion with strong levamisole resistance
(alleles x37, x13, x18) to almost wild type locomotion with mild
levamisole resistance (alleles b404, x26). we found one missense mutation (x26), one nonsense mutation (x13), one deletion (b404), and two mutations (x37 and x18) that disrupt splice
junction consensus sites (fig. 1b). these results provide strong
evidence that unc-63 corresponds to the nachr subunit encoded by y110a7a.3.
in addition, we rescued the unc-63 uncoordinated phenotype
by injecting the construct punc-63.1 into the syncitial gonad of
young adult unc-63(x37) animals. three independently transformed lines carrying the extrachromosomal array of unc-63
(lm200, unc-63(x37);exunc-63) were obtained, each of which
showed restored sensitivity to levamisole and phenotypically
wild type locomotion. we analyzed the phenotype of one rescued mutant by comparing the speed of locomotion of strains
n2 (wild type), unc-63(x37);exunc-63, and unc-63(x37). the

locomotion characteristics were as follows (bends/min ⫾ s.d.,

n ⫽ 20). together with the sequences of five unc-63 mutant
alleles, these results show that the jtf#38 cdna clone we isolated corresponds to the unc-63 gene.
features of the unc-63 polypeptide—as shown in fig. 2,
unc-63 consists of 502 amino acids and possesses motifs common to cys-loop ligand-gated ion channels, including an nterminal signal peptide of 23 amino acids (24), 4 transmembrane regions, and the cys-loop (1). also present are conserved
stretches of amino acids in loops a–f, which are involved in
ligand binding. in loop c, there are two adjacent cysteines,
defining unc-63 as a nachr ␣ subunit. using the  xxxg873xxx  motifs program, we identified one putative glycosylation site at
position asn-136 and potential phosphorylation sites within
the large m3–m4 intracellular loop (fig. 2). a phylogenetic tree
of c. elegans nachr subunits based on derived sequence identity is shown in fig. 3. as indicated in the tree, unc-63 is most
similar to unc-38, sharing 49% identity. however, it is interesting to note that in loop c of unc-63, the typical yxcc motif
is present rather than the unusual yxxcc motif found in loop
c of unc-38 (6).
the unc-63 gene is expressed in both muscle cells and
neurons—to determine the tissue-specific localization of unc-

63, we injected n2 animals with a genomic fragment of unc-63
fused to dna encoding gfp (25), as shown in fig. 4a. in
transgenic animals expressing the unc-63::gfp fusion protein fluorescence was observed in all body wall muscles and in
vulval muscles (fig. 4). we also detected expression in many
cells of the nervous system, including motor neurons in the
ventral nerve cord (as, da, db, which innervate dorsal muscles; vb, vd and db, which innervate ventral muscles; vc
which innervates vulval and ventral muscles) and neurons in
the head, posterior lateral, pre-anal, and lumbar ganglia. the
expression of unc-63 in both body wall muscles and motor
neurons is consistent with locomotion defects observed for
unc-63 mutants.
lev-1 is a possible partner for the unc-63 ␣ subunit in a
native nachr—the subunits unc-38, unc-29, and lev-1
are also associated with levamisole resistance in c. elegans.
both unc-29 (10) and unc-38 (11) are expressed in the body
wall muscles of c. elegans, overlapping at least in part with the
unc-63 expression pattern. this raises the possibility that
unc-63, unc-38, and unc-29 subunits may co-assemble to
form a native levamisole-sensitive receptor. to test whether
lev-1 might also be a component of this body wall muscle
receptor, we determined the expression pattern of lev-1. we
made a gene fusion construct (lev-1::gfp) with 4 kb of the lev-1
5⬘ genomic sequence and the entire lev-1 genomic coding se-

quence fused at the c terminus to gfp (fig. 4a). the transgene was then injected into the recessive lev-1(e211) mutant.
the lev-1(e211) allele contains a missense mutation (g461e)
located in the m4 region and exhibits normal locomotion in
the absence of levamisole, becoming uncoordinated (but not
hypercontracted as with wild type) in the presence of 1 mm
levamisole. injected lev-1::gfp restored levamisole sensitivity to the lev-1 mutant, demonstrating that the transgene
rescued lev-1(e211), and as shown in fig. 4, g and h, gfp
expression was observed in all body wall muscle cells and in
a subset of motor neurons in the ventral nerve cord. thus
lev-1 has overlapping expression with unc-63 as well as
unc-38 and unc-29.

unc-63 and lev-1 are part of the levamisole-sensitive acetylcholine receptor—two pharmacological classes of acetylcholine receptors function on muscles at c. elegans neuromuscular junctions. one is specifically activated by levamisole,
whereas the other is activated by nicotine and inhibited by
dihydro-␤-erythroidine (11). the levamisole-sensitive current
recorded from body wall muscle requires the function of unc-38
and unc-29 (11). we wanted to test whether unc-63 and lev-1
are also required for functional levamisole-sensitive muscle
nachrs. therefore the electrophysiological properties of the
c. elegans body wall muscle nachrs were examined in wild
type, unc-63, and lev-1 mutant animals. as observed previously
(11), the muscles of wild type worms responded to 100 ␮m ach

nematode levamisole-sensitive nicotinic receptors

discussion

levamisole is a potent anthelmintic drug, which is used to
eradicate nematode infestations in a number of domestic animals (26). application of levamisole to wild type c. elegans
causes muscle hypercontraction, paralysis, and ultimately
death, although the exact cause of death is unknown. through
the analysis of levamisole-resistant mutants, we can begin to
understand the actions of levamisole by identifying targets
within the worm that are required for levamisole sensitivity.
previous studies suggest that the molecular targets of levamisole include nachrs at the c. elegans neuromuscular junction
(8, 9, 11). application of levamisole directly onto voltageclamped c. elegans body wall muscles produces inward currents that are abolished in mutants encoding the nachr subunits unc-38 and unc-29 (11). this observation is consistent
with the muscle expression of these two subunits and can
explain the observed muscle hypercontraction of worms exposed to levamisole.
here we report the identification of a novel nachr subunit
in c. elegans, which shows greatest sequence similarity with
unc-38 and physically maps in the vicinity of unc-63, one of 12
loci identified in genetic screens for mutants that confer levamisole resistance (7). sequence analysis of five unc-63 alleles
revealed mutations in the predicted open reading frame of the
nachr clone, indicating that unc-63 encodes the novel nachr.
this was confirmed by demonstrating that the strongly levamisole-resistant allele unc-63(x37) could be behaviorally rescued
by expressing an extrachromosomal array of the wild type
nachr cdna clone. using an unc-63::gfp fusion construct, we
showed that unc-63 is present in muscles. patch clamp electrophysiology was deployed to show that muscle responses to
direct applications of levamisole are virtually eliminated in the
unc-63(x37) allele, indicating that unc-63 is an essential component of a levamisole receptor.
we have also demonstrated that lev-1, in addition to unc63, unc-38, and unc-29, is expressed in the body wall muscles of c. elegans. the lev-1(e211) mutant worms are resistant
to levamisole, although their locomotion appears normal. electrophysiological analysis of the lev-1(e211) mutant animals
indicated that 86% of the levamisole-sensitive current was
abolished (fig. 5a). because lev-1(e211) produces a missense
mutation, the residual levamisole response may reflect only a
partial loss of function of the lev-1 subunit or the presence of
a poison subunit that reduces the efficacy of the heteromeric

receptor. alternatively, the lev-1 subunit may be less essential, possibly being replaced by other non-␣ subunits such
as unc-29.
we also show that unc-63 and lev-1 subunits, similar to
unc-29 and unc-38, are expressed in a subset of c. elegans
neurons. this suggests that these subunits participate in neuronal excitability, and these may represent additional targets
for levamisole. other nachr subunits have overlapping expression with unc-63 in several identified neurons such as
acr-5 (db, vb) (27) and acr-2 (da, db, va, vb) (28). the
composition of the nachr receptors in these neuronal locations
and their potential roles in levamisole sensitivity will require
further analysis.
thus, we have identified a fourth nachr subunit that is a
constituent of nematode levamisole-sensitive receptors, and we
have established that lev-1 contributes to the normal functioning of this receptor. it remains to be determined whether
there is either a muscle levamisole-sensitive nachr composed
of unc-38, unc-63, unc-29, and lev-1 or perhaps more than
one receptor, each made from various combinations of the four
subunits. it is clear, however, that unc-38, unc-63, and
unc-29 are required subunits of all functional levamisole receptors on the medial body muscles. it is worth noting that, in
terms of sequence identity, unc-38 and unc-63 are most
closely related to the ␣ subunit acr-6, whereas unc-29 and
lev-1 are most similar to the non-␣ subunits acr-2 and
acr-3 (fig. 3). although acr-6 has yet to be characterized, we
know that acr-2 or acr-3 coexpress with unc-38 in xenopus
oocytes to form functional ion channels upon which levamisole
acts as an agonist (29, 30). indeed, acr-2 was shown to be
expressed in a number of ventral cholinergic motor neurons
(28) overlapping with the neuronal expression of unc-63. it
would thus be of interest to determine the expression patterns
of acr-3 and acr-6 as a first step in evaluating their potential
as further components of neuronal levamisole-sensitive
nachrs. studies of these subunits as well as other levamisoleresistant loci may prove instructive in understanding the molecular mechanisms of drug action and developing improved
parasite control agents as well as investigating mechanisms of
drug resistance.

by generating inward currents with rapid onset and decay, and
the same cells responded to 100 ␮m levamisole with similar
currents but with slower onset and decay. as shown in fig. 5a,
the response to 100 ␮m levamisole was almost completely abolished for unc-63(x37) and dramatically reduced to only 14% of
that observed in the wild type in lev-1(e211). we then tested
whether the second nachr type was still present in both
mutants by pressure application of ach onto voltage-clamped
body wall muscle cells of unc-63(x37) and lev-1(e211) mutants
(fig. 5b). in both mutants, ach elicited a robust inward current, although the responses were smaller than the wild type.
this reduction in response to ach is consistent with the loss of
levamisole receptor contribution to the total ach response in
unc-63(x37) and lev-1(e211). we also measured the effects of
dihydro-␤-erythroidine on the ach-elicited responses (fig. 5b).
in wild type worms, the inward current was blocked by 84%,
whereas in lev-1(e211), there was an 89% block, and an almost
complete block of 95% was observed in unc-63(x37), consistent
with loss of the second muscle nachr type. overall, these data
suggest that levamisole-sensitive receptors in body wall muscle
require the functional expression of unc-63 and lev-1 in
addition to unc-29 and unc-38.
