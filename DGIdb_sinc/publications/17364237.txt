abstract carbofuran and malathion, well known pesticides, and paraquat, a world widely used herbicide, were
tested on acetylcholinesterase (ache) from bungarus
sindanus venom and  xxxg248xxx  ( xxxg248xxx ) from
human serum. the calculated ic50 values for inhibition of
venom enzyme by malathion, carbofuran and paraquat
were 2.5, 0.14, and 0.16 lm, respectively. the values for
inhibition of serum  xxxg248xxx  ( xxxg248xxx ) were 3.5,
0.09 and 0.18 lm, respectively. analysis of kinetic data
indicated that the inhibition caused by malathion, carbofuran and paraquat was mixed for venom ache. for  xxxg248xxx 
from human serum, the inhibition caused by malathion and
paraquat was mixed and for carbofuran it was uncompetitive. the present results suggest a commercial paraquat
preparation (a popular herbicide) inhibits cholinesterases
with similar or higher potency than classical pesticide
inhibitors. furthermore, this inhibition was observed both
in human serum and snake venom, a newly studied source
of ache.

introduction
cholinesterases are classified into two major groups,
depending on their substrate specificity. acetylcholinesterase (ache; e.c.3.1.1.7) is a membrane bound enzyme
present in cholinergic neurons and it plays an essential role
in controlling the transmission of nerve impulses across
cholinergic synapses and at the neuromuscular junction
(chatonnet and lockridge 1989; milatovic and dettbarn
1996; schetinger et al. 2000).  xxxg248xxx 
( xxxg248xxx ; e.c.3.1.1.8) is known as a non-specific cholinesterase, pseudo cholinesterase or simply cholinesterase.
physiologically,  xxxg248xxx  modulates the levels of cholinergic
agents formed during the metabolism of lipids and also
regulates free cholines in the plasma (dave et al. 2000). in
mammals, ache is abundant in the brain, muscles and
erythrocyte membranes, whereas  xxxg248xxx  is predominantly
found in the liver, intestine, heart, kidney and serum (ecobicon and corneau 1973; prody et al. 1987; dave et al.
2000).
the venom of elapidae snakes possesses several poisons which are highly toxic to man, causing death in several parts of the world, particularly in asia (bawaskar and
bawaskar 2004). bungarus venom is one of the richest
source of actylcholinesterase, containing 747000 ellman’s
units per g of dry venom of ache-like activity (frobert
et al. 1997).
the study of the amino acid sequence shows that both
vertebrate ache and mammalian  xxxg248xxx  have some
homology. they share 65% of the amino acid sequence and
their substrate hydrolysis is carried out by the ‘‘catalytic
triad’’ of ser, his and glu in the active center (chhajlani
et al. 1989). moreover, our previous study indicated that
they can differ in their sensitivity toward inhibitors such as
tacrine (ahmed et al. 2006).

thus, the first aim of the present study was to find out
in vitro, whether the herbicide paraquat and the widely
used pesticides malathion and carbofuran, which are classical inhibitors of ache in the central cholinergic system
and in neuromuscular junctions (ansari and kumar 1984;
hassal 1990; gupta 1994; bretaud et al. 2000; miron et al.
2005), also inhibit bungarus sindanus ache. the second
aim was to compare the inhibitory potency of these compounds using these different sources of enzymes (snake
venom and human serum).

materials and methods
materials
acetylthiocholine iodide, dtnb [5,5¢-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)], carbofuran (99%; 2,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-7-benzofuranol methylcarbamate)  xxxd2055xxx 
and bovine  xxxg124xxx  were purchased from sigma (st.
louis, mo, usa). malathion (95%; [(dimethoxyphosphinoth-ioyl) thio] butanedioic acid diethyl ester), and paraquat (n,n¢-dimethyl-44¢-bipyridinium dichloride) were
kindly donated by fmc quimica do brasil ltda. sodium
dihydrogen phosphate and disodium hydrogen phosphate
were purchased from neon comercial ltda (brasil). all
other reagents used were of analytical grade.
human serum
human serum (without any anticoagulant) was obtained
from healthy volunteers [24–33 years old from both sexes
(males = 5 (50%) and females = 5 (50%)] from the university hospital from santa maria, with written consent.
the protocol was approved by the human ethics committee of the university hospital from santa maria (protocol number: 23081.006134/2006-81). none of the
volunteers had a recurrent or a past history of psychiatric
illness, significant medical disorder, or drug, cigarette or
alcohol abuse. none of them had been taking any medication for at least the past 30 days. from all participants,
5 ml of blood was collected in vacutainer tubes, centrifuged at 3,000 rpm (1,000 g) for 10 min and the serum was
stored at –20c for further use.
venom
venom from fifteen live adult bungarus sindanus snakes
was milked manually, mixed up randomly to give 5 different samples (n = 5), immediately lyophilized and stored
at –20c. all the snakes were captured from wild and
identified by zoologists.

cholinesterase assay
cholinesterase activities were determined by the method of
ellman et al. (1961) as modified by rocha et al. (1993).
 xxxg248xxx  was determined in a medium containing 0.05–1 mm
acetylthiocholine iodide, 62 mm phosphate buffer, ph 7.5,
0.2 mm dtnb and 40 ll of human serum [700 lg of
protein, 17.5 lg/ll (w/v)]; while for ache 40 ll snake
venom [4 lg of protein, 0.1 lg/ll (w/v)] were added to the
reaction mixture and pre-incubated for 30 min at 37c.
about 60 lm of  xxxd2055xxx  (a potent and selective
inhibitor of  xxxg248xxx ) was used in ache assay in order to
inhibit the presence of  xxxg248xxx  in the sample. this method
employs acetylthiocholine iodide (acsch) as a synthetic
substrate for cholinesterases. the substrate is hydrolyzed
to thiocholine and acetate by ache. thiocholine reacts
with dithiobisnitrobenzoate (dtnb) to produce a yellow
color (scheme 1). that is directly proportional to cholinesterase activity. the yellow color was monitored at
412 nm at every 10 s during 2–3 min using a hitachi 2001
spectrophotometer. all samples were run in duplicate or
triplicate. the enzyme activity was expressed as lmol
acsch hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein.

protein determination
protein was assayed by the method of bradford (1976)
using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard.
kinetic determinations
the kinetic of the interaction of the pesticides and herbicide with cholinesterase was determined using the
lineweaver and burk (1934), double reciprocal plot. the
x-axis represent inverse of acetylthiocholine concentration
(1/s) and y-axis represents the inverse of the enzyme
activity (1/v). substrate concentrations ranged from
0.05 mm to 1 mm in the absence and in the presence of
malathion (1.2–6 lm), carbofuran (0.07–0.2 nm) and
paraquat (0.12–0.36 lm). km values were obtained by two
different estimations, 1/v vs. 1/s (lineweaver and burk
1934) and v vs. v/s (hofstee 1952; dowd and riggs 1965).
the ki values were obtained using cornish–bowden plots
of s/v vs. [i]. ic50 was calculated according to the dixon
and webb (1964) plot using 1/v vs. [i].
statistical analysis
statistical analysis was performed using one way anova,
which was followed by post-hoc analysis (duncan multiple
range test) using the statistica software package (stat
soft, tulsa, ok, usa).

results
malathion (fig. 2), carbofuran (fig. 3) and paraquat
(fig. 4) inhibited snake venom and human serum cholinesterase activities. statistical analysis revealed a concentration dependent inhibition in the two different sources of
enzyme. for human serum  xxxg248xxx , kinetic analysis indicated that the inhibition caused by malathion (fig. 5a) and
paraquat (fig. 5b) was mixed, while carbofuran (fig. 5c)
caused an uncompetitive type of inhibition. for snake
venom ache, kinetic data indicated that the inhibition
caused by malathion (fig. 6a), carbofuran (fig. 6b) and
paraquat (fig. 6c) was of the mixed type. in fact, km
values increased and the vmax decreased as the concentration of the inhibitors increased. the calculated ic50 values
for inhibition of snake venom ache were 2.5 lm,
0.14 nm and 0.16 lm for malathion, carbofuran and
paraquat, repectively (table 1). for human serum ( xxxg248xxx ),
the calculated ic50 values were 3.5, 0.09 and 0.18 lm for
malathion, carbofuran and paraquat, respectively (table 2).
the ki calculated for snake venom ache and for human
serum  xxxg248xxx  were obtained by using cornish–bowden

fig. 2 snake venom acetylcholinesterase (a) and human serum
 xxxg248xxx  (b) activities in the presence and absence of
different concentrations of malathion. hydrolysis rates v were
measured at 412 nm by using 0.4 mm substrate (s) concentration
in 1 ml assay solutions with 62 mm phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) and
0.2 mm dtnb [5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)] which was pre
incubated for 30 min before 0.4 mm substrate addition. all experiments were repeated at least three times and similar results were
obtained. * p < 0.002 for (a) and * p < 0.0002 for (b) significantly
different from control

plots of s/v vs. [i]. the ki values for snake venom ache
was 0.73, 0.017 and 0.35 lm for malathion, carbofuran
and paraquat, respectively (table 1) while for human serum it was 1.6, 0.012 and 0.1 lm for malathion, carbofuran
and paraquat, respectively (table 2).

discussion
the pesticides (malathion and carbofuran) and herbicide
(paraquat) inhibited cholinesterase in bungarus sindanus
(krait) venom and human serum using acetylthiocholine as
a substrate (fig. 1). the inhibitory potency of the pesticides and herbicide was different depending on the nature

significantly different from control

of the enzyme source (figs. 2, 3, and 4), which indicates
different types of interaction between inhibitors and the
two classes of cholinesterases. in addition, structural differences between the enzymes tested, mainly peculiarities
in the primary and tertiary enzyme structure, are present.
the results of lineweaver–burk analysis indicate that
pesticides (malathion, carbofuran) and herbicide (paraquat)
inhibited human serum (fig. 5) and snake venom acetylcholinesterase (fig. 6) in a concentration dependent manner. the nature of the inhibition caused by malathion and
paraquat were mixed type with both type of enzymes. it
was clearly observed that km values increased and vmax

123

decreased with increase concentration of pesticides. for the
case of carbofuran, a mixed type of inhibition was found
with snake venom ache (fig. 6c), while with human
serum  xxxg248xxx  activity it was found to be of an uncompetitive type (fig. 5c). the decrease in vmax suggests that the
toxicant produce conformational changes in the enzymes.
the enzymes have two sites: an acylation site or a-site and
peripheral site or p-site (rosenberry et al. 2005). 3-d
structure of ache shows that the a-site is below the active
site residue, while the p-site is at its mouth (harel et al.
1993; szegletes et al. 1999). toxicants (pesticides and
herbicide) could interact with che at either the
che-acsch complex stage or at regulatory site of the free
che. in the case of free enzyme, the toxicant would form a
complex with che i.e., toxicant-che that would thereby
decreased both acylation and deacylation (kreienkamp
et al. 1991; bourne et al., 1995). in line with this, thiocholine formation, the first product of the hydrolysis of
acsch, was decreased with increasing concentrations of
toxicant. in the case of ache–acsch complex, the anionic
subsite of che is occupied by the choline moiety of the
substrate acsch and is not available for the toxicant;
therefore toxicant will prefer to bind other than active site
(a-site) i.e., peripheral site or p-site. when the toxicant
binds to the p-site, conformational changes of the enzyme
can occur and sterically block the active site of the gorge,
reducing the rate at which other molecules enter or exit the
a-site. if the toxicant remains associated with the enzyme–
product complex at the bottom of the active site gorge, the

toxicant can cause a decrease in the rate of product dissociation from the catalytic site. in this case, the complex
che.toxicant.s is converted to che.toxicant.p and the
presence of the toxicant at the bottom of the active site
delays the dissociation of the product.
we propose the following scheme for the interactions
between the toxicant with the snake venom ache.
che + toxicant , che.toxicant

ð1þ

che.toxicant þ s , che.toxicant.s

ð2þ

che.toxicant.s , che.s þ toxicant

both binary (che.toxicant or che.s) and ternary
(che.toxicant.s) complexes could be formed. when the
ternary complexes che.toxicant.s are formed, the product
is liberated at a lower rate, decreasing the vmax in the case
of the mixed type of inhibition.
in the present study, the ic50 values calculated for snake
venom ache and for human serum  xxxg248xxx  are very close to
values for other cholinesterases (from different origins)
inhibited by organophosphorus compounds (jamal et al.
2001). the pesticides and herbicide presented a high

123

affinity toward venom ache, when compared to human
serum  xxxg248xxx , and this may be due to the structural difference between the two different sources of enzymes.
surprisingly, the calculated ic50 values calculated for
ache and buche inhibition by paraquat were less than
malathion, which can be due to impurities present in the
commercial paraquat. these data show that both the pesticides and herbicide, which are commonly used in agriculture, inhibited ache in snake venom and had
toxicological effects on human serum  xxxg248xxx .
