tissues and their differential sensitivity
to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

objective—to evaluate cyclooxygenase isozyme distribution in tissues from dogs and determine the differential sensitivity of canine cyclooxygenase (cox)-1
and -2 isozymes to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (nsaids).
sample population—canine tissue samples (stomach, duodenum, ileum, jejunum, colon, spleen, cerebral cortex, lung, ovary, kidney, and liver) were
obtained from 2 dogs for northern and western blot
analyses, and blood for whole blood cox assays was
obtained from 15 dogs.
procedure—11 nsaids were evaluated to determine
their cox-2 selectivity in whole blood assays. the
concentrations of the drug needed to inhibit 50% of
enzyme activity (ic50) were then calculated for comparison. expression and tissue distribution of cox
isozymes were determined by northern and western
blot analysis.
results—aspirin, diclofenac, indomethacin,  xxxd2423xxx , meclofenamic acid, and  xxxd2969xxx  had little selectivity toward cox isozymes, whereas ns398,  xxxd446xxx , tolfenamic acid,  xxxd2727xxx , and  xxxd2065xxx  had
more than 5 times greater preference for inhibiting
cox-2 than cox-1. all canine tissues examined,
including those from the gastrointestinal tract, coexpressed cox-1 and -2 mrna, although protein
expression was observed only for cox-1.
conclusions and clinical relevance—canine cox-2
was selectively inhibited by  xxxd2065xxx ,  xxxd2727xxx , and
ns398; tolfenamic acid and  xxxd446xxx  also appeared
to be preferential cox-2 inhibitors in dogs. the roles
of cox-1 as a constitutive housekeeping enzyme and
cox-2 as a proinflammatory inducible enzyme (as
determined in humans) appear to apply to dogs;
therefore, cox-2-selective inhibitors should prove
useful in reducing the adverse effects associated with
nonselective nsaids. (am j vet res 2004;65:

t

he cyclooxygenase (cox) isozymes catalyze the
first committed step in the conversion of  xxxd208xxx  to various prostanoids.  xxxg1883xxx  is
constitutively expressed in most mammalian tissues,
whereas its isoform cox-2, which was discovered in
1991, is not constitutively expressed in most mammalian tissues.1-3 however, the expression of cox-2
may be induced in response to cytokines, mitogens,
trauma, and other stimuli. the prostanoids produced
by cox-1 act as local hormones and regulate renal,
gastrointestinal tract, and platelet functions.4
conversely, the prostanoids produced by cox-2 have
been implicated in inflammatory responses, cell division, and angiogenesis, as well as in influencing water
and salt balance effected by the kidneys.5
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)
have their effect through the inhibition of cox
enzymes.6 however, in humans and animals, inhibition
of cox-1 and cox-2 by the administration of nsaids
is often associated with adverse effects, most commonly gastric toxicosis including the development of ulcers
that may progress to perforation with risk of sepsis.
functional cox-1 and cox-2 are both necessary to
maintain the integrity of the lining of the gastrointestinal tract. fueled by the discovery of cox-2 and the
elucidation of its biological properties, new nsaids
have been produced that selectively inhibit only cox-2.
this new class of inhibitors effectively reduces pain and
inflammation with fewer adverse effects. in humans,
cox-2-selective drugs such as celecoxib, rofecoxib,
and  xxxd3481xxx  are now widely used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.
it is estimated that as many as 20% of the nearly 53
million dogs in the united states have arthritis (of differing severity), and thus, dogs constitute the second
largest target population for administration of cox-2selective inhibitors.7 the adverse effects associated
with nsaids are difficult to manage in dogs because
mild clinical signs are easily overlooked. in addition, it
has been reported that dogs are even less tolerant of
nsaids than are humans and more at risk for nsaidinduced gastropathy.8-10 although many research efforts
have sought to identify cox-2-selective inhibitors for
use in humans, cox-2-selective inhibitors for administration to dogs and other animals have not been studied as extensively. the purpose of the study reported
here was to evaluate cox isozyme distribution in tissues from dogs and determine the differential sensitivity of canine cox-1 and -2 isozymes to nsaids. the
data obtained would be used to determine whether the

function and expression of canine cox-1 and cox-2
is similar to that in humans. in addition, a whole blood
assay system was used to determine which of the currently available nsaids has the most cox-2-selective
action in dogs.
materials and methods
animals—fifteen adult outbred dogs < 2 years old from
colonies at brigham young university, a private kennel, and a
local animal shelter were used as blood donors. fourteen
dogs were involved in the study procedures (7 dogs for the
cox-1 and cox-2 evaluations). a single blood sample
(50 ml) from each dog was obtained via venipuncture by use
of an 18-gauge catheter and collected via gravity flow into
tubes containing heparinized pbs solution (19 u of
heparin/ml of blood; ph, 7.4). canine tissue samples (stomach, duodenum, ileum, jejunum, colon, spleen, cerebral cortex, lung, ovary, kidney, and liver) were obtained from 2 dogs
immediately after they were euthanatized by an overdose of
pentobarbital. dogs received a high level of care and humane
handling. all experimentation was approved by brigham
young university’s institutional animal care and use
committee and complied strictly with the animal welfare
act and us public health service policy on the humane care
and use of laboratory animals.
cell culture—a supply of ccl34 madin darby canine
kidney cells (mdkcs) were obtained from american type
culture collectiona and cultured in minimum essential
alpha) containing l-glutamineb and supmedium-alpha (mem-alpha
plemented with 10% fetal calf serum (fcs),c penicillin
(100 u/ml), and streptomycin (100 µg/ml).d to induce
expression of cox-2, cells were exposed to phorbol-12myristate-13-acetate (pma; 100 ng/ml)e in serum-free medium for 18 to 24 hours.
primary structures—canine cox-1 and cox-2
sequences were obtained by cdna cloning and compared
with canine sequences in genbank (accession no. ax
082872 and ax 082874).
northern blot analysis—total rna was isolated from
canine tissues (stomach, duodenum, ileum, jejunum, colon,
spleen, cerebral cortex, lung, ovary, kidney, and liver) by use
of guanidinium isothiocyanate.11 twenty-five micrograms of
total rna was separated by gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon membrane. after hybridization, blots were
washed, dried, and exposed to radiographic film for 4 to 15
hours. as a control for rna loading in the northern blots, the
same blot used above was hybridized with  xxxg53xxx  cdna
labeled with phosphorus p 32 (32p).
western blot analysis—protein was isolated from each
sample of tissue (approx 100 mg) by homogenization in
300 µl of pbs solution (ph, 7.4) containing protease
inhibitor cocktail,f followed by lysis with sds. protein samples were quantified by use of a bradford assayg; 15 µg of each
sample was separated on a 12% sds-polyacrylamide gel and
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. for cox-1 analysis, the membrane was incubated with anti-ovine cox-1
(1:1,000).h ovine cox-1 has all the critical catalytic residues
and many of the epitopes of cox-1 from dogs and humans.4
for cox-2 analysis, the membrane was incubated with antihuman cox-2 (1:1,000), which has a high degree (> 90%) of
sequence similarity with canine cox-2. the anti–cox-1
antibody readily detects recombinant canine cox-1 variants
expressed in insect cells (data not shown), but does not
detect inducible cox-2 in ccl34 mdkcs. conversely, the
cox-2 antibody detects inducible cox-2 in ccl34 mdkcs,
but not recombinant canine cox-1 or its variants. both

membranes were incubated with goat anti-mouse antibody
(1:2,000). blots were analyzed by chemiluminescence by use
of the western blot chemiluminescence reagent.i
assay of cox activity in gastrointestinal tract tissue
from dogs—tissue punches j were used to excise 8-mmdiameter tissue samples from the gastrointestinal tract of a
euthanatized dog. samples were obtained from the fundus of
the stomach, the pyloric antrum, duodenum, jejunum,
ileum, and colon. each punch biopsy specimen included
mucosa and muscularis layers of the gastrointestinal tract tissues. after isolation, biopsy specimens were placed in 400 µl
of pbs solution containing protease inhibitor cocktail.f
tissues were homogenized at low speed for 2 minutes, to
which 50 µl of 270 µm  xxxd208xxx  (final concentration, 30 µm) was added. tissues were incubated at 37oc for
15 minutes and boiled for 10 minutes. samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed for analysis. to
measure cox activity, the production of  xxxd1903xxx 
(pge2) in the supernatant was assessed via radioimmunoassay. assessments of each tissue sample were performed in
triplicate.
inhibition of cox-1—blood samples were obtained via
venipuncture by use of an 18-gauge catheter and collected
via gravity flow into tubes containing heparinized pbs solution (19 u of heparin/ml of blood; ph, 7.4). the cox-1
inhibition assays were performed as described by warner et
al.12 for drug inhibition assays, aspirin, diclofenac,
indomethacin,  xxxd2423xxx , meclofenamic acid, ns398 ([n{2-cyclohexyloxy-4-nitrophenyl} methanesulfonamide]),h
 xxxd446xxx , tolfenamic acid, and  xxxd2065xxx  were dissolved in
100% ethanol;  xxxd2969xxx  and  xxxd2727xxx  were dissolved in
 xxxd1896xxx . each drug was serially diluted into pbs
solution, so that maximum concentration of solvent was
< 0.1%. forty microliters of each drug preparation was added
to eppendorf tubes, to which was added 400 µl of freshly
collected blood. vehicle-only controls were prepared in the
same manner. each concentration of drug was assayed in
quadruplicate with 100 µl of blood-drug mixture used per
assay. in each assay, the blood-drug mixture was incubated at
37oc for 1 hour followed by addition of 10 µl of a calcium
ionophoree (a23187; 110 µg/ml)/100 µl of whole blood and
incubation at 37oc for 30 minutes. the addition of a23187
activates  xxxg1759xxx , which cleaves  xxxd208xxx 
from the phospholipid bilayer and provides substrate for
coxs. to terminate the reaction, diclofenac (100µm, final
concentration) was added to the wells, the plates were immediately centrifuged at 2,000 x g for 5 minutes, and plasma
was removed into a duplicate 96-well plate and stored at
–70oc for further assay. samples from 3 to 7 dogs were
assayed for each nsaid. to determine cox-1 activity, plasma was analyzed by radioimmunoassay to measure the concentration of thromboxane b2.13
inhibition of cox-2—for cox-2 inhibition assays,
ccl34 mdkcs were plated in 96-well plates (5 x 104
cells/well) and incubated at 37oc until confluent. to achieve
serum deprivation, cells were placed in mem-alpha containing
0.9% fcs for 24 hours. after serum deprivation, cells were
stimulated to express cox-2 by exposure to pma
(100 ng/ml) for 24 hours.
the cox-2 inhibition assays in the presence of whole
blood were performed as described by warner et al.12 to
inhibit platelet cox-1, study dogs were each administered
one 300-mg aspirin tablet orally 24 hours prior to phlebotomy. blood was collected and added to drug dilutions prepared as described by warner et al.12 cell media was aspirated from ccl34 mdkcs, and the cells were then exposed to
100 µl of blood containing drug dilutions for 1 hour at
37oc, followed by addition of a23187 and diclofenac, as

described for the cox-1 whole blood assay.
plates were immediately centrifuged, and plasma was collected and frozen at –70oc for further analysis. each concentration of drug was
assayed in quadruplicate. samples from 3 to 7
dogs were assayed for each nsaid. because of
the aspirin pretreatment of dogs in the cox-2
assay, different dogs were used for cox-1 and
cox-2 assays. to determine cox-2 activity,
plasma was analyzed by radioimmunoassay to
measure the concentration of pge2.
in vitro assay of cox-2 inhibition by
 xxxd2065xxx  in pma-stimulated ccl34 mdkcs—
serum-deprived ccl34 mdkcs (1 x 105
cells/well) in 96-well plates were incubated with
200 µl of serially diluted etodolack combined
with 100 ng/ml pma at 37oc for 24 hours.
 xxxd2065xxx  was serially diluted in mem-alpha containing 0.9% fcs. cells were incubated for 24
hours at 37oc and aliquots of media (120 µl)
from each well were collected and stored at
–80oc for further analysis. to determine cox-2
activity, pge2 production (ng/ml) was measured by radioimmunoassay. inhibition of cox2 by  xxxd446xxx  and ns398 were similarly
assayed.
inhibition of cox-2 activity in plasma
versus whole blood—blood was collected from
a dog (not involved in the other study procedures) that had previously been administered
aspirin (300 mg, po) as described for the
cox-2 assay. forty milliliters of blood was centrifuged at 2,600 x g for 4 minutes to separate figure 1—sequence alignment of canine and human cyclooxygenase (cox)-1 prithe cell fraction from plasma. the cell fraction mary amino acid sequence. the canine cox-1 amino acid sequence was predictwas washed twice with pbs solution containing ed by use of the complete canine cox-1 cdna sequence. the signal peptide of

inhibition curves—thromboxane b2 and pge2 production was analyzed as a mean of 4 values at each drug dilution.
enzyme inhibition was expressed as a percentage of control
values with 100% (vehicle only) representing no inhibition
of cox activity and 0% representing complete inhibition of
enzyme. from these data, inhibition curves for each drug
were constructed and the concentrations of the drug needed
to inhibit 50% of enzyme activity (ic50) were calculated by
use of computer software.l each ic50 value represents the
mean obtained from 3 to 7 blood donor dogs. the
cox-2:cox-1 ratio was calculated from the mean ic50 values for cox-1 and cox-2 inhibition of each drug.

results
comparison of human and canine primary amino
acid structure—one-kilobase (kb) segments from the
coding region of canine cox-1 and cox-2 were
cloned and sequenced in the study of this report; however, complete cdnas of canine cox-1 and cox-2
and their predicted amino acid sequences were recently determined by others.14 the canine and human primary amino acid sequences were compared to deter812

between canine and human cox-1 and 90.1% similarity between canine and human cox-2 (fig 1 and 2).
all residues involved in coordination of arachidonic
acid in the cox catalytic site16 as well as known
residues involved in tyrosyl radical formation, acetylation by aspirin, coordination of heme, glycosylation,
and critical residues in the peroxidase active site were
completely conserved in cox-1 and cox-2 between
the 2 species. in addition, the major differences in the
first and second shell of the cox-1 and cox-2 active
sites were conserved between dogs and humans.17
northern blot analysis of canine coxs—the levels of cox-1 and cox-2 mrna expression in canine
tissues were evaluated by use of northern blot analysis
(fig 3) to determine whether cox expression in dogs
is similar to other mammalian systems. all canine tissues examined expressed the approximately 2.6-kb
cox-1 transcript. results of subsequent northern blot
analyses indicated that canine liver also expressed the
expected 2.6-kb mrna transcript.
in addition to the 2.6-kb cox-1 transcript, the

figure 2—sequence alignment of canine and human cox-2 primary amino acid
sequence. the canine cox-2 amino acid sequence was predicted by use of the
complete canine cox-2 cdna sequence. the signal peptide of cox-2 is indicated by the underlined residues; residues conserved between species are indicated by asterisks. numbers to left of sequences represent amino acid residues.

cerebral cortex of dogs also expressed a
smaller mrna (approx 1.9 kb) that
hybridized with the cox-1 probe.
similarly, all canine tissues examined in the
study of this report had detectable levels of
the 4.5-kb cox-2 mrna transcript when
probed with 32p-labeled canine cox-2
cdna (fig 3). although detectable, the
amount of cox-2 mrna expressed was
< 10% of the amount of cox-1 mrna.
subsequent northern blot analysis revealed
that canine liver expresses this same 4.5-kb
cox-2 mrna.
as a control for specific hybridization
in these northern blots, rna was isolated
from pma-induced ccl34 mdkcs that
expressed abundant amounts of cox-2
mrna. when probed with canine cox-1
cdna, this rna included a band of a higher molecular weight than that of the other
cox-1 transcripts, which indicated that
the cox-1 probe was most likely crosshybridizing to a small extent with the large
amount of 4.5-kb cox-2 mrna present in
these ccl34 mdkcs. the cox-2 blot
analysis revealed a large amount of cox-2
mrna produced by the pma-induced
ccl34 mdkcs (fig 3). shorter exposures
of this blot indicated that this was a distinct
single mrna species that migrated at the
same position as the cox-2 mrna from
the canine tissues. although similar
amounts of ribosomal rna were observed
in ethidium bromide-stained gels (data not
shown), the amount of mrna present in
the samples of canine tissues examined varied, as indicated via probing with  xxxg53xxx 
(fig 3).
expression of cox protein—all 11
canine tissues examined, including the
platelet control, contained the cox-1 protein (fig 4). four distinct proteins of different mobilities (77, 74, 58, and 51 kd,
respectively) were observed in all tissues.
in samples of brain tissue, the cerebral cortex included an additional protein of 54 kd.
however, the pma-induced ccl34
mdkcs did not contain any detectable
amounts of cox-1 protein. in contrast to
results obtained with northern blotting
analysis, none of the 11 tissues expressed
cox-2 protein regardless of whether they
contained detectable cox-2 mrna.
however, as expected, the pma-induced
ccl34 mdkcs contained considerable
amounts of cox-2 protein.

of the gastrointestinal tract examined had high cox
enzyme activity as demonstrated by detection of a large
amount of pge2 made in response to the addition of
exogenous  xxxd208xxx  (30µm). tissues from all 6
regions produced at least 2 µg/ml of pge2 during a 15minute incubation with exogenous  xxxd208xxx .

assay of cox-2 in ccl34 mdkcs —in our
laboratory, ccl34 mdkcs have been shown to
express cox-2 mrna and protein in response to
stimulation by pmam; also, these cells do not express
cox-1 mrna or protein as shown by the fact that
no cox-1 rna was detected via polymerase chain
reaction analysis. because of these properties,
ccl34 mdkcs were used as the source of cox-2 in
the whole blood assay for nsaid inhibition of cox2.
it was essential to determine the reproducibility of nsaid inhibition of cox-2 in ccl34 mdkcs
prior to their use in these whole blood assays. to do
this, the ability of several nsaids (ns398,h  xxxd446xxx , and  xxxd2065xxx ) to inhibit cox-2 was evaluated
in the presence of cell culture media alone. serially
diluted  xxxd2065xxx , a cox-2 preferential drug used in
humans, inhibited cox-2 in these cells in a dosedependent and highly reproducible manner (in 3
independent experiments, ic50 values were 11.9,
17.6, and 20.5nm, respectively; fig 5). similarly
reproducible results were obtained with ns398 and
 xxxd446xxx .
whole blood assays—by use of whole blood
assays, we determined ic50 values for 11 commercially
available nsaids for cox-1 and cox-2 inhibition in
blood from dogs (table 1). activity inhibition curves
were plotted (fig 6).

whole blood— xxxd446xxx  has been reported to be highly
cox-2 selective in canine cells in vitro.18 although
 xxxd446xxx  potently inhibited cox-2 in ccl34 mdkcs in
vitro, this finding was not replicated in the whole blood
assay. the inhibitory activity of  xxxd446xxx  was profoundly
decreased when it was placed in whole blood, suggesting
unusual protein binding properties of this nsaid. to
determine whether  xxxd446xxx  was bound primarily by cellular components or plasma proteins in the blood of dogs,
the assay was performed in whole blood, the cellular fraction of blood, and cell culture media (fig 7).  xxxd446xxx 
delivered in cell culture media was an extremely potent
inhibitor of cox-2 in ccl34 mdkcs (ic50 value, 2.3
nm). conversely,  xxxd446xxx  potency was affected by several orders of magnitude when delivered to ccl34
mdkcs in whole blood or the washed cellular fraction of
blood (ic50 values, 8.1 and 9.4 µm, respectively).
discussion
the purpose of the study reported here was to
characterize cox-1 and cox-2 expression in canine
tissues and to evaluate isozyme-specific nsaid inhibi-

figure 6—inhibition of cox-1 (squares) and cox-2 (triangles) by
meclofenamic acid (a) and ns398 (b) detected via the whole
blood assays. thromboxane b2 release from canine platelets was
assayed for cox-1 activity, and pge2 production from canine
ccl34 mdkcs was measured for cox-2 activity in the presence
of whole blood (values reported as percentage of the activity in
vehicle-treated control cells). each curve represents composite
data from 2 or 3 dogs; blood from each dog was assayed in quadruplicate at each drug concentration. in panel a, the concentration of the drug needed to inhibit 50% of enzyme activity (ic50)
for cox-1 and cox-2 were 5.86 and 0.79 µm, respectively; in
panel b, ic50 values for cox-1 and cox-2 were 149.5 and 1.17

tion of cox-1 and cox-2. as part of this study, it was
important to determine structural differences between
canine cox isozymes and their human counterparts.
to that end, 1.0-kb segments of the coding region of
canine cox-1 and cox-2 were cloned and sequenced.
however, complete cloning of the canine cox
sequences was accomplished by others during the
course of our study.14 our evaluation of these reported
sequences with those encoding human cox-1 and
cox-2 suggested that critical residues in the active
sites of canine coxs are identical with their human
homologues. however, excluding the signal peptide,
cox-1 contains 39 amino acid substitutions and cox2 contains 54 amino acid substitutions at positions
away from the cox or peroxidase active sites. as
demonstrated by smith and marnett,19 who substituted
serine for a cysteine residue away from the active site
to significantly alter enzyme activity, we cannot
exclude the possibility that these substitutions in
canine cox-1 and cox-2 are unimportant or do not
affect the pharmacologic inhibition of these enzymes
by nsaids. however, the complete conservation of
residues in the cox active site suggested that inhibition of canine cox-1 and cox-2 by nsaids would be
similar to that in humans. the elucidation of a crystal
structure of canine coxs would help to resolve this
issue.
in dogs, cox-1 mrna and protein expression was
similar to that known in other mammalian species.
nearly all of the canine tissues investigated in the
study of this report expressed both cox-1 mrna transcripts and cox-1 protein. of particular interest was
expression of cox-1 in the gastrointestinal tract
because prostaglandin synthesis serves to protect the
integrity of its mucosal surfaces. in dogs, administration of nsaids is associated with a high degree of gastrointestinal tract toxicosis, compared with that in
humans.8-10 our data indicated that the cox-1 in the
gastrointestinal tract tissues of dogs was functionally
active and likely is the primary cox isozyme that protects the gastrointestinal tract in dogs as in other mammalian species.
in the study of this report, cox-2 expression was
detected at the rna level in all tissues examined, without concomitant expression of cox-2 protein.
detection of cox-2 mrna but not cox-2 protein in
the 11 canine tissues examined suggests that either the
expression of cox-2 is translationally blocked or posttranscriptionally regulated in dogs. posttranscriptional
regulation may result in a high turnover rate of the
cox-2 protein. another possibility is that the mrna
expression that was detected resulted in proteins that
were smaller than the 72-kd cox-2 that was derived
from these messages. a 27-kd protein that cross-reacted strongly with the cox-2 antibody was detected in
colon and spleen specimens obtained from dogs.
however, the expression of this 27-kd protein did not
parallel expression of cox-2 mrna, which was
detected in almost all tissues and was likely a result of
crossreactivity of the monoclonal antibody with an
unknown protein.
the cerebral cortex of dogs expressed 2 mrnas of
approximately 2.6 and 1.9 kb, respectively. the 1.9-kb
816

band is composed of 2 splice variants of cox-1 (designated as pcox-1a and pcox-1b, respectively).20
these variants encode predicted 52- to 54-kd proteins.
because of the close similarities between the primary amino acid sequence of canine and human cox
isozymes, it might be anticipated that nsaids would
show similar inhibitory effects in both species.
however, in dogs,  xxxd446xxx  has previously been
reported to be over 100-fold selective for cox-218; in
contrast,  xxxd446xxx  is non–cox-2 selective in
humans.12 studies18, 21 of nsaid-associated cox inhibition in dogs have involved evaluation of washed
platelets or proliferatively quiescent cultured cells (to
measure cox-1) and mitogen-stimulated cultured
cells (to measure cox-2). both types of assays were
performed in the absence of whole blood. in an effort
to resolve the discrepancy regarding  xxxd446xxx  inhibition, the study of this report was designed to determine
the effectiveness of selected nsaids on the inhibition
of canine cox in whole blood from dogs. the use of a
whole blood system more realistically models physiologic conditions of drug binding and delivery.
in our laboratory, the measurement of nsaidassociated cox inhibition in pma-stimulated ccl34
mdkcs has yielded highly reproducible results and
cox activity is inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion.m
by use of protocols identical to those used by warner
et al12 to measure cox-1 and cox-2 selectivity in
humans, we evaluated the effect of 11 nsaids on
canine cox activity. in the study of this report, cox1 inhibition in platelets and cox-2 inhibition in pmastimulated ccl34 mdkcs were measured. these
whole blood assays have been reported to be superior
to other types of whole blood assays because measurement of both cox-1 and cox-2 inhibition can be
determined in parallel.12 compared with assays of
cox-2 inhibition in ccl34 mdkcs in the absence of
whole blood, the whole blood assays had considerable
dog-to-dog variability. similar variability has been
detected with use of these assays in humans.12,22
results of our study of the inhibition of coxs by
11 nsaids indicated that 6 of those nsaids (aspirin,
diclofenac, indomethacin,  xxxd2423xxx , meclofenamic
acid, and  xxxd2969xxx ) had less than a 5-times preference
for inhibiting either isozyme. five drugs (ns398,
 xxxd446xxx , tolfenamic acid,  xxxd2727xxx , and  xxxd2065xxx )
had more than 5 times greater preference for inhibiting
cox-2 than cox-1. the known cox-2-selective
inhibitor, ns398, showed 18 times greater selective
inhibition of cox-2 and was the most selective drug
identified in the study of this report. of the drugs tested, ns398 is the most cox-2 selective in humans.
 xxxd2727xxx  and  xxxd2065xxx  (other known cox-2 preferential inhibitors) exhibited 8 and 7 times greater preference for cox-2. in our study,  xxxd446xxx  had 6 times
greater preference for inhibiting cox-2.
an unexpected finding of our study was that tolfenamic acid, which is not known to have cox-2 selectivity, was 14 times more selective toward canine cox2 than cox-1 in whole blood assays and had a cox-2
selectivity approaching that of ns398. both  xxxd446xxx 
and tolfenamic acid are diaryl acidic nsaids but have
only limited structural similarity. cocrystallizations

and other investigations will be needed to elucidate
how these drugs preferentially inhibit cox-2 in dogs
but not in humans.
in the study of this report,  xxxd446xxx  was 6 times
more selective for inhibiting cox-2 than cox-1 with
an ic50 value of 16.6 µm for cox-2. these data are not
consistent with those of another study18 in which a
 xxxd446xxx  racemic mixture had 129 times greater selectivity for cox-2 than cox-1, with an ic50 value of
0.102 µm.18 this discrepancy may be explained by the
binding of  xxxd446xxx  in canine whole blood. in another
study23 involving administration of  xxxd446xxx  to dogs,
the drug had a small volume of distribution. the small
volume of distribution of  xxxd446xxx  has also been identified in other species (eg, cats24) and is believed to be a
result of a high level of binding to blood proteins. our
data have indicated that  xxxd446xxx  is 1,000 times less
potent in canine whole blood than it is in cell culture
media. similarly, this 1,000 times lower potency was evident in the presence of the washed cellular component
of canine blood, which suggested that some component
of the cellular fraction of canine whole blood tightly
binds  xxxd446xxx , thereby decreasing its potency substantially. although this tight binding to the cellular fractions was assayed only in 1 dog, it may be subject to
variation among individuals. this finding is relevant
where washed canine platelets were used to test for
 xxxd446xxx  potency against cox-1, particularly if those
values are compared with results obtained in cultured
cells and media as a measure of  xxxd446xxx  potency
toward cox-2.18 the ic50 value for  xxxd446xxx  inhibition
of platelet cox-1 in another study18 was 13 µm; this is
comparable to the ic50 value for  xxxd446xxx  inhibition of
cox-2 (16.6 µm) and cox-1 (91 µm) determined via
whole blood assays performed in our study. these values
are also comparable to that observed for the inhibition
of cox-2 in the cellular fraction of canine blood (9.4
µm). thus, we speculated that any contamination of
washed platelets by cell fraction components may bind
 xxxd446xxx  considerably and account for the reported
decrease in cox-1 inhibition by  xxxd446xxx , compared
with cox-2 inhibition.
one of the goals of current pharmacologic research
is the determination of a cox-2-selective inhibitor for
use in dogs, which represent the second largest target
population for these drugs. results of our study confirmed that the active sites of cox-1 and cox-2 have
some similarity to those in humans because ns398,
 xxxd2065xxx , and  xxxd2727xxx  (which are cox-2 preferential in humans) were also cox-2 preferential in dogs.
the degree of preferential inhibition approximated that
determined for these drugs in humans. however, the
canine coxs appeared to differ from the human
enzymes because  xxxd446xxx  and tolfenamic acid were
preferentially inhibitory toward cox-2 in dogs but not
toward cox-2 in humans. none of the nsaids tested
were highly selective (eg, > 20 times less preferential)
cox-2 inhibitors such as rofecoxib,  xxxd3481xxx , and
 xxxd2069xxx , which have recently been developed for
humans. thus, the synthesis of highly selective, nontoxic cox-2-selective inhibitors seems possible and
likely will prove useful as gastric mucosa-sparing antiinflammatory agents for use in dogs.
