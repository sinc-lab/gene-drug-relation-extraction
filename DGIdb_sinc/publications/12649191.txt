abstract
expression of drug-resistant forms of  xxxg631xxx  (dhfr)
in hematopoietic cells confers substantial resistance of animals to antifolate administration. in this study, we tested whether the chemoprotection
conferred by expression of the tyrosine-22 variant dhfr could be used
for more effective therapy of the 32dp210 murine model of chronic
myeloid leukemia (cml). administration of the maximum tolerated dose
of  xxxd3442xxx  (tmtx) with the nucleoside transport inhibitor prodrug
nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribose-5ⴕ-monophosphate (nbmpr-p) inhibited 32dp210 tumor progression in mice engrafted with transgenic tyrosine-22 dhfr marrow and improved survival of tumor-bearing animals
as long as drug administration was continued. nbmpr-p coadministration was necessary for maximal tumor inhibition, as administration of
tmtx alone delayed but did not prevent tumor progression. the chemoprotection afforded by engraftment with transgenic tyrosine-22 dhfr
marrow was necessary for effective chemotherapy, as normal mice lacking
transgenic marrow could not tolerate the higher tmtx dose (60 mg/kg/
day) administered to mice with transgenic marrow, and the decreased
dose of tmtx with nbmpr-p tolerated by normal tumor-bearing animals did not inhibit tumor progression or improve animal survival. we
conclude that tmtx with nbmpr-p inhibits tumor progression in the
32dp210 model of cml in animals engrafted with drug-resistant tyrosine-22 dhfr transgenic marrow, and that based on this model the
introduction of a drug-resistant dhfr gene into marrow combined with
tmtx and nbmpr-p administration may provide an effective treatment
for cml.

introduction
cml3 is a disease of the hematopoietic stem cell, resulting in the
expansion and premature circulation of relatively mature myelocytes.
in most cases, cml is characterized by a translocation between
chromosomes 22 and 9, resulting in fusion of the bcr and abl genes
(1). the resulting bcr-abl fusion oncogene has been shown to be
necessary and sufficient for malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells (2). many murine models of bcr-abl⫹ cml result in syndromes resembling acute leukemia or lymphoma in a subset of tumorbearing animals (2, 3) rather than chronic-phase myeloid leukemia.
one such model is the 32dp210 cell line (4), established by insertion
and expression of human bcr-abl cdna in the murine myeloid cell
line 32d (5). mice infused with 32dp210 cells exhibited rapid infiltration of myeloblastic 32dp210 cells into a variety of tissues, in a
syndrome resembling blast-phase or acute myeloid leukemia (6).

(ec 1.5.1.3), resulting in depletion of reduced folates necessary for
thymidylate and purine nucleotide synthesis, and toxicity for actively
dividing cells (7). various forms of dhfr containing amino acid
substitutions have been identified that are less susceptible to inhibition
by antifolates than wild-type dhfr (8 –10) and can render cells
resistant to antifolates. introduction of a variant dhfr gene into
mouse bone marrow has been shown to confer increased antifolate
resistance to transplanted mice (11–15). the chemoprotection provided by drug-resistant marrow potentially allows for improved antitumor chemotherapy at greater antifolate doses (16). however, we
observed previously that the higher doses of mtx afforded by drugresistant dhfr expression in marrow caused an increase rather than
a decrease in progression of the 32dp210 murine model cml, suggesting that use of a different dhfr inhibitor would be necessary for
improved antitumor chemotherapy (6).
the antifolate tmtx is a more specific inhibitor of dhfr than mtx,
as mtx polyglutamates also directly inhibit  xxxg2366xxx  as well
as  xxxd149xxx  ribonucleotide and aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylases in de novo purine biosynthesis (17). unlike
mtx, tmtx does not rely on the reduced folate carrier for transport into
cells and does not require polyglutamylation for inhibition of dhfr (18).
both mtx and tmtx have been shown to be effective alone or in
combination with other chemotherapeutic agents against breast cancer
and a variety of other tumors, and tmtx is also effective for the
treatment of pneumocystis pneumonia (7, 19 –21). because reduced folates contribute to the formation of purine and thymidine nucleotides,
salvage of exogenous purine nucleosides and thymidine can rescue cells
from antifolate toxicity (22, 23). however, nucleoside transport inhibitors
can restore mtx toxicity to cells expressing wild-type dhfr while
maintaining differential toxicity relative to cells expressing drug-resistant
dhfr (24).
this paper describes the effect of tmtx in combination with the
nucleoside transport inhibitor prodrug nbmpr-p on progression of the
32dp210 tumor model in normal mice and in mice protected from drug
toxicity by engraftment with tyrosine-22 dhfr transgenic marrow. coadministration of tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p in mice engrafted with transgenic
marrow inhibited progression of 32dp210 tumor and improved survival
of tumor-bearing mice engrafted with dhfr transgenic marrow as long
as drug administration was continued. engraftment with drug-resistant
transgenic marrow was found to be necessary for chemotherapy, as the
maximal drug dose tolerated by animals lacking drug-resistant dhfr
was insufficient to inhibit tumor progression or improve animal survival.
these results suggest that expression of drug-resistant tyrosine-22 dhfr
in the marrow with subsequent administration of an appropriate antifolate
may provide effective treatment for cml.

penicillin, 50 ␮g/ml streptomycin, and 0.125 ␮g/ml  xxxd164xxx  (life technologies, inc.). these cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 37° and
5% co2.
animals and bone marrow transplant. c3h-he/j and fvb/n mice
were obtained at 6 – 8 weeks of age from the nih facility at frederick, md.
the tyrosine-22 dhfr transgenic fvb/n mice (line 11) used for these
experiments were described previously (15). f1 offspring of c3h ⫻ fvb/n
matings were designated c3f-f1 mice; line 11 dhfr transgenic fvb/n mice
were used in mating pairs with c3h-he/j mice to generate tyrosine-22 dhfr
transgenic c3f-f1 mice, as described previously (6). animals were housed in
an association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal careaccredited facility according to institutional guidelines.
for bone marrow transplant, marrow was flushed from femurs and tibiae of
euthanized transgenic c3f-f1 mice. transgenic marrow cells (5 ⫻ 106) were
injected i.v. into lethally irradiated (800 rads cesium) nontransgenic c3f-f1
mice. animals were allowed to engraft for 2 months before subsequent tumor
administration and/or chemotherapy.
tumor administration and therapy. 32dp210⫹gfp tumor cells were
injected in 0.5 ml of pbs (celox laboratories, inc., st. paul, mn) through the
tail vein into c3f-f1 mice. tmtx (medimmune oncology, inc., gaithersburg, md) and nbmpr-p (alberta nucleoside therapeutics, alberta, ontario,
canada) were solubilized in water and stored at ⫺20°c as stock solutions after
filter sterilization. starting 1 day after tumor injection, pbs, tmtx, and 20
mg/kg nbmpr-p were administered daily by independent i.p. injection as
indicated in “results.” animal weight and health were monitored daily, and
moribund animals were euthanized by co2 asphyxiation. the spleen was
collected from moribund animals and assessed for leukemia-associated splenomegaly (expressed as percentage of spleen weight; spleen weight/total animal
weight at death ⫻ 100). animals with ⬎0.5% spleen weight were scored as
leukemic, based on measurements from tumor-free control animals. at regular
intervals, peripheral blood was collected from the periorbital vein into heparinized microhematocrit capillary tubes (fisher scientific, pittsburgh, pa) for
hematocrit determination or flow cytometric analysis. statistical comparison of
survival between different groups was conducted by using the kaplan-meier
product limit method (25) and calculating the log-rank statistic (26).
flow cytometric analysis. flow cytometry was used to follow in vivo
growth of 32dp210⫹gfp tumor. blood samples were transferred into tubes
containing an equal volume of 1000 units/ml  xxxd2267xxx  salt solution (icn
biomedicals inc., aurora, oh). the rbcs were lysed, and nucleated cells
were fixed either using an ammonium chloride solution (8.99 g of nh4cl, 1 g
of khco3, and 37 mg tetrasodium edta/liter; sigma-aldrich) and 0.5%
paraformaldehyde (electron microscopy sciences, fort washington, pa),
respectively, or by using optilyse b solution (immunotech, marseille, france).
approximately 10,000 cells/sample were analyzed for gfp⫹ tumor cells using
the fitc/gfp channel on a becton dickinson facscalibur (bd immunocytometry systems, san jose, ca) within 96 h of preparation. the background
level of fluorescence intensity was determined using a sample prepared from
a control animal that had not received tumor, whereas a sample of
32dp210⫹gfp cells was used as a positive control. a gfp⫹ cell percentage
of ⱖ1% was deemed substantial, based on samples from negative control
animals. flow cytometric data were analyzed using flowjo 3.2 software (tree
star, inc., san carlos, ca) to determine the percentage of cells in each sample
that exhibited gfp fluorescence greater than background.

tmtx with nbmpr-p improves survival and inhibits tumor
progression in 32dp210 tumor-bearing mice engrafted with
dhfr transgenic marrow. to test the effect of tmtx and
nbmpr-p on 32dp210⫹gfp tumor progression, marrow from
tyrosine-22 dhfr transgenic c3f-f1 mice was transplanted into
lethally irradiated normal c3f-f1 recipients (see “materials and
methods”). after engraftment, animals were infused with 106
32dp210⫹gfp tumor cells and subsequently administered either
pbs or 80 mg/kg/day tmtx and 20 mg/kg/day nbmpr-p (based on

days, and drug administration was resumed on day 12 at a decreased tmtx dose of 60

control animals after 8 days as evidenced by animal mortality in both
groups (fig. 1a). therefore, drug administration was withdrawn for 4
days and then resumed at a lower tmtx dose of 60 mg/kg/day,
maintaining the nbmpr-p dose at 20 mg/kg/day.
we found that whereas pbs-administered control animals succumbed to tumor ⬃20 days after infusion of tumor cells, there was no
tumor-related mortality observed in drug-treated animals out to 45
days during drug administration (fig. 1, a and b). at this point, it
appeared as if tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p had cured the animals of the
32dp210 tumor. however, after drug administration was stopped (on
day 49) the majority of surviving animals succumbed to tumor-related
mortality within 1 month (fig. 1b). thus, tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p
delayed 32dp210 tumor onset but did not completely eliminate the
tumor. the difference in survival between tumor-bearing animals
administered tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p and animals administered pbs
was statistically significant (p ⬍ 0.011), with an extension in median

nbmpr-p coadministration improves survival and enhances
tumor inhibition by tmtx in 32dp210ⴙgfp tumor-bearing
mice engrafted with dhfr transgenic marrow. to determine
whether nucleoside transport inhibition was necessary for tmtx to
inhibit 32dp210⫹gfp tumor progression, c3f-f1 mice engrafted with
dhfr transgenic drug-resistant marrow (as in the previous experiment)
were infused with 106 32dp210⫹gfp tumor cells and subsequently
administered pbs, 60 mg/kg tmtx, or 60 mg/kg tmtx with
nbmpr-p daily. drug toxicity again required a brief period of withdrawal (from days 20 to 23 after tumor administration), after which drug
administration was resumed at the same dose. the difference in animal
survival between tumor-bearing animals administered pbs and those
administered drug was not statistically significant, but the median survival time was extended from 29 days for animals administered pbs to
61 days for animals administered tmtx, and to 83 days for animals
administered tmtx with nbmpr-p (fig. 2a). animals administered
tmtx or tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p also exhibited a delay in tumor-related
mortality compared with animals administered pbs (fig. 2b). during the
course of drug administration, no tumor-related deaths were observed in
animals administered tmtx with nbmpr-p. in striking contrast, 71%
tumor-related deaths were observed in animals administered tmtx
without nbmpr-p (fig. 2b), indicating the effectiveness of the drug
combination in comparison with tmtx alone. to determine whether
prolonged treatment could completely eliminate 32dp210⫹gfp tumor,
drug administration was continued out to 78 days, after which time both
drug-related and tumor-related deaths were observed in animals treated
with tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p (as determined by the absence and presence of
splenomegaly, respectively). thus, 60 mg/kg/day of tmtx alone delayed tumor-related mortality compared with animals administered pbs,
but coadministration of nbmpr-p along with tmtx provided an even
greater delay in tumor-related mortality.
tumor load in each animal was measured by flow cytometry to
detect fluorescent gfp⫹ tumor cells in peripheral blood samples
collected during the course of the experiment. as observed previously
(6), pbs-administered animals exhibited only background levels of
gfp⫹ cells in their peripheral blood (fig. 3a). many of the animals
administered 60 mg/kg/day of tmtx exhibited detectable (⬎1%)
gfp⫹ tumor in the peripheral blood (fig. 3b). this result is reminis-

cent of the exacerbation of 32dp210 tumor progression caused by
mtx that we reported recently (6). in contrast, gfp⫹ cells were not
detectable in animals administered 60 mg/kg/day of tmtx with
nbmpr-p (fig. 3c). taken together with the survival and tumorrelated morbidity data (fig. 2), these results show that administration
of 60 mg/kg/day of tmtx alone improved survival and delayed
tumor-related mortality but did not prevent tumor progression during
the course of drug administration, whereas tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p
additionally prevented tumor expansion and emergence into peripheral blood for as long as drug administration was continued.
engraftment with dhfr transgenic marrow is necessary for
tmtx and nbmpr-p to improve survival and inhibit tumor
progression in 32dp210ⴙgfp tumor-bearing mice. to determine whether the chemoprotection afforded by drug-resistant marrow
is necessary for tmtx and nbmpr-p to inhibit tumor progression,
we also tested normal c3f-f1 animals lacking drug-resistant marrow.
normal mice received 107 32dp210⫹gfp tumor cells followed by
daily administration of pbs, 40 mg/kg of tmtx with nbmpr-p, or
60 mg/kg of tmtx with nbmpr-p. tumor-bearing animals engrafted with drug-resistant marrow were administered 60 mg/kg/day
of tmtx with nbmpr-p, the maximum dose tolerated as determined
in the experiments described above. the combination of 60 mg/kg/day
of tmtx with nbmpr-p was lethal for mice lacking drug-resistant
marrow by day 42 (fig. 4a), with the average hematocrit falling to 15
at day 24 (fig. 4c). whereas normal mice were able to tolerate a
lower dose of 40 mg/kg/day of tmtx with nbmpr-p for an extended period of time, this regimen did not significantly improve
animal survival compared with tumor-bearing animals administered
pbs (fig. 4a). in contrast, survival of tumor-bearing animals trans-

planted with drug-resistant marrow was significantly improved by administration of 60 mg/kg/day of tmtx with nbmpr-p (p ⬍ 0.0002
at day 42 compared with normal mice at the maximum tolerated drug
dose), and the median survival time was extended to 54 days from 18
days for animals receiving pbs. tumor-related deaths were observed
in normal animals administered either pbs or 40 mg/kg/day of tmtx
with nbmpr-p (fig. 4b; as determined by % spleen weight, fig. 4d),
whereas tumor-related deaths were not observed in mice transplanted
with drug-resistant marrow and administered 60 mg/kg/day tmtx
with nbmpr-p (fig. 4b) until after drug administration was stopped,
consistent with the previous experiments (figs. 1 and 2). the increased number of tumor-related deaths in animals transplanted with
drug-resistant marrow in this experiment compared with the experiments shown in fig. 2 was most likely the result of the higher tumor
dose used (107 cells) and a shorter duration of drug administration.
pbs-administered animals exhibited only background levels of gfp⫹
cells in the peripheral blood during the first month (fig. 5a), whereas
many of the normal mice administered 40 mg/kg/day of tmtx with
nbmpr-p exhibited detectable (⬎1%) gfp⫹ tumor in peripheral
blood (fig. 5b). in contrast, gfp⫹ cells were not observed in either
normal animals (fig. 5c) or in animals transplanted with drug-resistant marrow (fig. 5d) when administered 60 mg/kg/day of tmtx
with nbmpr-p (except for 1 animal at the last time point tested; fig.
5d). taken together with the tumor-related mortality data, these
results show that 60 mg/kg/day of tmtx with nbmpr-p, the dose
required to inhibit tumor progression, can only be achieved in animals
that have been protected from antifolate toxicity by engraftment with
drug-resistant dhfr transgenic marrow, as these drug doses were
rapidly toxic for animals lacking the drug-resistance gene.

discussion
the effectiveness of tmtx and the nucleoside transport inhibitor
prodrug nbmpr-p as antitumor agents was assessed in the 32dp210
murine model of cml to evaluate a drug-resistance gene therapy
approach for treatment of cml. the combination of tmtx and
nbmpr-p was found to improve animal survival and inhibit progression of the 32dp210 tumor in mice engrafted with drug-resistant
tyrosine-22 dhfr transgenic marrow. coadministration of
nbmpr-p was necessary for maximal inhibition of tumor, as administration of tmtx alone delayed but did not prevent tumor progression. the chemoprotection afforded by engraftment with dhfr transgenic marrow was necessary for effective chemotherapy, as mice
lacking transgenic marrow could not tolerate the higher drug doses
(60 mg/kg/day of tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p) required to confer an antitumor effect.
chemotherapy for treatment of cml has been only partially successful, consisting primarily of ifn-␣, which can induce hematological remission and prolong survival but is not curative (27, 28).
recently, the selective abl  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor sti571 has
proved effective in inhibiting growth of bcr-abl⫹ cells (29) and has
shown great promise in clinical trials for treatment of chronic-phase
cml (30), although significant numbers of patients with blast-phase
cml and bcr-abl⫹ acute lymphoid leukemia are refractory to sti571
treatment or relapse after treatment with sti571 (31). resistance to
sti571 in these patients has been attributed to bcr-abl gene amplification or point mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions in the
 xxxg2198xxx  domain of bcr-abl (32, 33).

allogenic marrow transplant has been established as a curative
treatment for cml (27). however, the availability of suitable donor
material is a concern, and graft-versus-host disease has been observed
in up to 68% of cml patients transplanted with hla-matched sibling
donor material (34). autologous marrow transplants for treatment of
cml typically result in relapse either because of incomplete ablation
of leukemia in the host during the preparative regimen for bone
marrow transplant or contamination of the graft with bcr-abl⫹ tumor
cells (35). introduction of a drug-resistance gene into autologous
marrow by retroviral transduction could allow for drug administration
after transplant to selectively eliminate leukemic cells that lack the
drug-resistance gene. one problem with this approach is the potential
for introducing the drug-resistance gene into tumor cells contaminating the donor marrow. we have investigated one means of addressing
this problem for cml by introduction of antisense sequences directed
against the fusion region of the bcr-abl message, thus decreasing
bcr-abl expression and restoring a more normal phenotype to transduced bcr-abl⫹ cells in the graft. this antisense strategy was examined previously in the 32dp210 model of cml, resulting in a 3
log-fold reduction in tumorigenicity of 32dp210 cells transduced with
a retroviral vector containing the drug-resistant tyrosine-22 dhfr
gene as well as antisense sequences directed against the bcr-abl
breakpoint region (36).
numerous studies have reported that expression of drug-resistant
dhfr in hematopoietic cells can protect mice from toxic doses of
mtx or tmtx (11–15, 37). additionally, tmtx in combination
with nucleoside transport inhibition has been used effectively for in
vivo selection of drug-resistant murine hematopoietic stem cells (38,
39).4 administration of higher doses of antifolate in protected animals
could allow for more effective treatment of tumors known to be
sensitive to antifolates (16) or against tumors that are not usually
treated with antifolates, such as cml. however, we observed previously in the 32dp210 model of cml that administration of mtx in
tumor-bearing mice engrafted with tyrosine-22 dhfr transgenic marrow did not inhibit tumor progression or improve survival of tumorbearing animals, but surprisingly exacerbated 32dp210 tumor progression, suggesting that other drugs or drug-resistance genes would
be necessary for an antitumor effect (6).
protection of the hematopoietic system from drug toxicity has been
examined for other drug-resistance genes, in particular the mgmt
gene (40) and the  xxxg10xxx  gene (41). expression of variant mgmt
genes has been shown to confer resistance to the combination of
 xxxd46xxx  and dna-alkylating agents such as  xxxd444xxx  and temozolomide, and to allow selective expansion of transduced hematopoietic cells in drug-administered animals without prior myeloablation (42, 43).  xxxg10xxx  gene expression has
been shown to confer cellular resistance to a number of chemotherapeutic agents including taxol, and to allow selective expansion of
transduced murine bone marrow cells (44). despite this progress in
demonstrating the expression of drug resistance genes for protection
from toxicity in experimental animals, application of such a chemoprotective effect for improved antitumor chemotherapy has not been
studied extensively. koç et al. (45) reported a significant delay in
progression of sw480 tumor xenografts in nude mice administered
multiple cycles of  xxxd46xxx  and 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1nitrosourea after transplantation with marrow transduced using a
retroviral vector encoding the g156a mutant mgmt. hanania and
deisseroth (46) reported improved antitumor effect of taxol at doses
tolerated only in animals transplanted with  xxxg10xxx -transduced marrow. human clinical trials have been conducted involving hematopoietic transduction with  xxxg10xxx  retrovirus (47–51), although the effectiveness of the approach as an antitumor strategy has yet to be
determined. using the dhfr system, zhao et al. (16) reported im-

proved survivability of eo11 breast tumors in mice administered
mtx at doses tolerated only after transplantation with marrow which
had been transduced by a retroviral vector encoding the f31s mutant
dhfr. here we demonstrate the prevention of 32dp210 tumor outgrowth and improved animal survival by administration of tmtx
with nbmpr-p at doses that required transplantation with marrow
expressing drug-resistant dhfr (l22y dhfr in this case). drug
administration at lower doses maximally tolerated by normal, untransplanted animals did not significantly affect tumor progression, demonstrating a necessity for drug-resistance gene expression. these
results additionally substantiate the concept of drug-resistance gene
transfer and expression for improved antitumor chemotherapy, particular for the use of antifolates in combination with nucleoside
transport inhibition.
in light of the incidence of sti571-resistant tumor in blast-phase
leukemia patients, an antisense/drug-resistance gene therapy approach
may prove beneficial for treatment of sti571-resistant bcr-abl⫹ leukemia. marrow transduction with antisense sequences directed against
the bcr-abl fusion region may be effective in decreasing expression of
bcr-abl in sti571-resistant cells, both in the case of gene amplification and in the case of mutations within the  xxxg2198xxx  domain,
potentially restoring sensitivity of the tumor cells to sti571 and
decreasing cell tumorigenicity. additionally, expression of a drugresistant dhfr gene may allow for increased antifolate administration after engraftment of transduced marrow for effective chemotherapy against sti571-resistant leukemia.
