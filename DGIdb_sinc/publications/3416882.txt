the purpose of this study was to measure rates of  xxxg345xxx -dependent ethanol uptake and rates of hzoz
generation in perfused rat livers in the presence of  xxxd2154xxx  of varying chain length. rates of ethanol uptake in
livers from fasted rats, perfused in a recirculating system, of about 80 pmol g-' h - ' were decreased to about
10 pmol g-' h-' by the addition of an inhibitor of  xxxg110xxx  (adh),  xxxd2148xxx . the
medium-chain-length fatty acid, laurate (12 :0; 1 mm), increased rates of  xxxd2148xxx -insensitive ethanol
uptake maximally to 80-85 pmol g-' h-'. rates of ethanol uptake diminished as the chain length of fatty acid
was decreased [hexanoate (6:o) = 23 pmol g-' h - l ; octanoate (8:o) = 55 pmol g-' h-';  xxxd1821xxx  (1o:o)
= 65 pmol g-' h-'1 or increased [ xxxd2681xxx  (14:o) = 77 pmol g-' h-'; palmitate (16:o) = 80 pmol g-' h-';
stearate (18:o) = 29 pmol g-' h-';  xxxd2777xxx  (18:l) = 60 pmol g-' h-'; erucate (22:3) = 22 pmol g-' h-'1 from
12 :0.  xxxd2777xxx  did not increase rates of hydroxylation of  xxxd2821xxx , a substrate for the  xxxd102xxx inducible form
of cytochrome p-450, indicating that the stimulation of ethanol uptake by  xxxd2154xxx  was not due to increased
mixed-function oxidation. the increase of ethanol uptake was also not due to displacement of  xxxd2148xxx 
from adh by  xxxd2154xxx , since  xxxd2777xxx  stimulated ethanol uptake by about 50% in perfused livers from deermice
genetically deficient in adh. the increase in  xxxd2148xxx -insensitive ethanol uptake by  xxxd2154xxx  was
blocked by the  xxxg345xxx  inhibitor, aminotriazole, indicating the involvement of  xxxg345xxx . rates of h z 0 2generation
by livers perfused in a non-recirculating system with 1.7% albumin were increased from 6 f 1 to 23 f.5 pmol g-'
h-' by  xxxd2777xxx  (1 mm). because of the discrepancy between rates of ethanol metabolism and hzoz production,
methods were developed to measure h z 0 2production in a recirculating perfusion system. h 2 0 2generation was
determined from the time necessary for steady-state level of  xxxg345xxx -h20z, measured spectrophotometrically
(660-640 nm) through a lobe of the liver, to return to basal values after the addition of a known quantity of
methanol, which is not metabolized by adh in the rat. basal rates of h 2 0 2 generation measued under these
conditions were 12 f 5 pmol g- ' h- ',values similar to basal rates of  xxxd2148xxx -insensitive ethanol uptake.
rates of hzoz generation were stimulated maximally by laurate to about 80 - 85 pmol g- h- ', and decreased
as the fatty acid chain length was decreased or increased, analogous to the stimulation of 4-methylpyrazoleinsensitive ethanol uptake by  xxxd2154xxx . there was an excellent correlation ( r = 0.99) between rates of hzoz
generation and rates of  xxxd2148xxx -insensitive ethanol uptake with all  xxxd2154xxx  studied. thus, increases
in h 2 0 2 generation and ethanol oxidation have similar chain-length specificities for  xxxd2154xxx . rates of h 2 0 2
generation from  xxxd2777xxx  of about 60 pmol g- ' h- ' were decreased 50% by an inhibitor of peroxisomal p-oxidation,
thioridazine (0.02 mm). rates were also decreased by 60% by decreasing the albumin concentration in the
recirculating system from 4.0% to 1.7%. rates of ketone body production from  xxxd2777xxx  were half-maximal at
about 0.13 mm  xxxd2777xxx ; maximal rates were about 90 pmol g- ' h- in contrast, rates of h 2 0 2production required
higher concentrations of  xxxd2154xxx  (e.g., half-maximal rates were observed with about 0.65 mm  xxxd2777xxx ; maximal
rates were around 60 pmol g-' h-'). thus, fatty acyl-coa compounds appear to be taken up by peroxisomes at
high rates only when uptake into mitochondria is saturated. hepatic fatty acid oxidation was estimated to be
mediated about 25% via peroxisomal p-oxidation in these studies. taken together, these data indicate that fatty
acids can provide hzoz for  xxxg345xxx -dependent peroxidation of ethanol in the perfused liver at high rates.

ethanol is one of the most widely abused hepatotoxic
drugs. chronic ingestion of ethanol is associated with cirrhosis, accumulation of hepatic lipid and necrosis in pericentral regions of the liver lobule [l]. in rats, the consumption of
a high fat diet concomitant with chronic administration of

ethanol is required for the development of hepatic fibrosis [2].
thus, interactions between dietary fat and ethanol toxicity
exist. interactions between fatty acid metabolism and ethanol
oxidation are well known. the metabolism of ethanol to acetaldehyde via  xxxg110xxx  (adh) decreases rates
of /3-oxidation of  xxxd2154xxx  [3,4], presumably via competition

in the peroxidation of ethanol via  xxxg345xxx -h,02 is the rate

478
of h 2 0 2generation [6]. because rates of h 2 0 2generation in
perfused rat livers have been reported [7] to be more than an
order of magnitude lower (3 - 5 pmol g- h- ') than rates of
ethanol uptake [8], it was concluded previously that  xxxg345xxx 
plays a minor role in ethanol metabolism [9, 101. however, it
has also been demonstrated that urate and  xxxd2219xxx , substrates for h202-generating peroxisomal flavoproteins,
stimulate ethanol metabolism via  xxxg345xxx  at rates of up to
60 pmol g- ' h- in perfused rat liver [ll].
it is now well established that hepatic fatty acid oxidation
occurs in both mitochondria and peroxisomes [12]. a major
difference between the mitochondrial and peroxisomal p-oxidation pathways is that the oxidation of fatty acyl-coa compounds in the peroxisomes generates h 2 0 2 [12, 131 while
mitochondrial p-oxidation generates fadh, and nadh
[14]. recently, it was demonstrated that  xxxd2154xxx  stimulate
rates of ethanol uptake by perfused livers markedly, from 10
to 80 pmol g-' h-', in the presence of  xxxd2148xxx , an
inhibitor of adh [15, 161. this stimulation was due presumably to increased rates of h 2 0 2 generation via peroxisomal
p-oxidation of fatty acyl-coa compounds [16]. because the
stoichiometry between rates of h 2 0 2generation and rates of
ethanol metabolism via  xxxg345xxx -h202is nearly 1 : 1, rates of
 xxxd2148xxx -insensitive ethanol uptake should be nearly
equal to rates of h 2 0 2generation. however, ethanol metabolism was tenfold higher than reported rates of h 2 0 2 production [17]; therefore, this work was performed to measure
rates of ethanol metabolism and h 2 0 2generation in the presence of  xxxd2154xxx  under identical experimental conditions.
the results indicate that h 2 0 2is indeed generated from fatty
acid metabolism at rates sufficient to support high rates of
ethanol oxidation via  xxxg345xxx -h202.preliminary accounts of
this work have been presented elsewhere [18, 191.

materials and methods
animals
female sprague-dawley rats (200 - 300 g; zivic-miller,
allison park, pa) were fasted 20 - 24 h prior to use. in some
experiments, rats were injected 1.5 h before perfusion with
either saline or aminotriazole (1.o g/kg, intraperitoneally). in
other experiments, male sprague-dawley rats (200 - 300 g)
were treated with either acacia (1%) or ciprofibrate (10 mg/
kg, orally; sterling-winthrop, renssalear, ny) in acacia once
daily for 5 days prior to experiments. deermice, genetically
deficient in  xxxg110xxx , were obtained from a
colony maintained at the university of north carolina from
a breeding stock generously provided by dr m. felder, university of south carolina.
liver perfusion
rat livers were perfused with oxygen-saturated krebshenseleit bicarbonate buffer (ph 7.4, 37Â°c) saturated with
95% o2: 5% co, in either a recirculating 1201 or a nonrecirculating system [21]. deermouse livers were perfused by
a modification of the above techniques, as described in detail
elsewhere [22]. livers from rats and deermice were perfused
via the portal vein at rates of around 4 or 8 ml min-' g-',
respectively, and oxygen concentration in the effluent
perfusate was monitored continuously with a teflon-shielded,
clark-type o2 electrode. ethanol, acetoacetate and p-hydroxybutyrate were determined enzymatically [23] and 4-nitrocatechol was determined spectrophotometrically [24,25] in

samples of effluent perfusate. methanol was measured by
incubating 0.1 ml of perfusate with 0.1 u of alcohol oxidase
in 1 ml of 100 mm tris/cl, ph 7.5, for 60 min. formaldehyde
formed from the oxidation of methanol was measured according to the method of nash [26]. rates of 4-nitrocatechol
formation from the hydroxylation of  xxxd2821xxx  and ethanol uptake in experiments with the nonrecirculating system
were calculated from concentration differences in the influent
and effluent solutions, the flow rate and the mass of wet tissue.
rates of ethanol and methanol uptake, and acetoacetate and
p-hydroxybutyrate production, in experiments employing a
recirculating system, were calculated from concentration differences per unit time, the liver wet mass and the volume of
perfusate (20 ml).
determination of the steady-state level of  xxxg345xxx -h202
the steady-state level of  xxxg345xxx -h202 was detected
spectrophotometrically (660- 640 nm) through a lobe of the
liver as described by sies and chance [27] with a dual-channel,
air-turbine-driven spectrophotometer [28]. rates of h 2 0 2
generation by livers perfused in a nonrecirculating system
were measured according to oshino et al. [7]. briefly,  xxxd2219xxx 
(1 mm) was infused to saturate  xxxg345xxx  heme maximally with
h 2 0 2and changes in the steady-state level of  xxxg345xxx -h202,
which reflect changes in the saturation of  xxxg345xxx  heme with
h 2 0 2 ,were measured. subsequently, methanol (20 mm) was
infused to reduce the steady-state level of  xxxg345xxx -h202to
zero. the concentration of methanol infused was then decreased stepwise and changes in the steady-state level of
 xxxg345xxx -h202 were monitored continuously. the concentration of methanol necessary to decrease  xxxg345xxx -h202by
50% was determined from plots of  xxxg345xxx  heme saturation
with h 2 0 2versus the log of methanol concentration infused
(e.g., fig. 2). rates of h 2 0 2 generation were calculated by
the equation: dx,/dt = 31.5 ali2 . e where dx,/dt = rate of
h 2 0 2 generation, a',, = the concentration of methanol
necessary to decrease  xxxg345xxx -h202 by so%, e =  xxxg345xxx 
heme content (25 nmol/g wet mass) and 31.5 = a kinetic
constant for  xxxg345xxx , derived previously [29].
peroxisomal p-oxidation by liver homogenates
rates of peroxisomal p-oxidation of  xxxd2154xxx  were measured from rates of formation of formaldehyde due to the
peroxidation of methanol via  xxxg345xxx -h202 [30]. briefly,
livers were homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose (1 : 5 ) ; 13 mg of
tissue was incubated for 10 min at 37Â°c in 3 ml 100 mm
tris/cl, ph 8.3, containing 100 mm methanol, 0.1 mm coa,
2.5 mm atp, 5 mm mgcl,, 200 pm nad', 33 mm nicotinamide, 0.9 mg/ml bovine  xxxg124xxx , 0.01% (mass/
vol.) triton x-100, 6.6 mm  xxxd3392xxx  and 1 mm fatty
acid. reactions were terminated with 0.3 ml 40% trichloroacetic acid and the formaldehyde formed from the oxidation
of methanol was measured colorimetrically [26]. rates were
calculated from formaldehyde formation per unit time and
the amount of tissue employed.
results and discussion
fatty-acid-stimulated ethanol metabolism
it is well established that  xxxd2154xxx  inhibit ethanol metabolism by 30-40% in the absence of alkylpyrazoles [3, 51.
since ethanol metabolism via both adh and p-oxidation of

livers from fasted female rats were perfused in a recirculating system
as described in materials and methods. ethanol (25-30 mm) was
added and rates of ethanol uptake were calculated from changes in
ethanol concentration in the perfusate over 30 min, the liver mass
and the volume of perfusate (20 ml). rates were corrected for
vaporization from the system, which was less than 10%. final concentrations of fatty acid were 1 mm; where noted,  xxxd2148xxx  was
added at a final concentration of 4 mm. rats were pretreated with
aminotriazole (1.5 g/kg, intraperitoneally) in saline for 1.5 h before

 xxxd2154xxx  requires n a d f , inhibition presumably occurs via
competition between the 3- xxxg1013xxx 
of the peroxisomal and the mitochondria1 p-oxidation spiral
and adh for cofactor. in the absence of redox inhibition of
adh, however, it was not clear what effects  xxxd2154xxx  might
have on hepatic ethanol oxidation. in the present study, ethanol uptake in the recirculating perfusion system containing
4% albumin was 79 f 5 pmol g- h - (table l), a value which
agrees well with data from previous work with livers from
normal, fasted rats [3, 15, 161. addition of an inhibitor of
 xxxg110xxx ,  xxxd2148xxx  (4 mm), decreased
rates to around 10 pmol 8-l h-'. hexanoate (1 mm) did
not alter rates of  xxxd2148xxx -insensitive ethanol uptake
significantly; however, rates were increased in the presence of
other saturated  xxxd2154xxx  such as octanoate (8 :0),  xxxd1821xxx 
(1o:o) and laurate (12:o) to 54, 62 and 81 pmol g-' h-',
respectively (fig. 1a, table 1).  xxxd2681xxx  (14:o) and palmitate (16 : 0) increased rates to 70 - 75 pmol g- h- while the
unsaturated fatty acid,  xxxd2777xxx  (18 : l), elevated rates to 60 pmol
g- h- ; however the 18-carbon saturated fatty acid, stearate
(18:0), increased rates to only about 30 pmol g-' h-'
(fig. 1a, table 1) and the 22-carbon unsaturated fatty acid,
erucate, increased rates to only 22 pmol g-' h-'. pretreatment of rats with the  xxxg345xxx  inhibitor, aminotriazole,
blocked the stimulation of ethanol uptake by octanoate, palmitate and  xxxd2777xxx  (table l ) .
it was not clear which enzyme system(s) was involved in
fatty-acid-stimulated ethanol metabolism, since aminotriazole
inhibits both  xxxg345xxx  and cytochrome p-450 [31, 321, and
 xxxd2154xxx  may displace  xxxd2148xxx  from the lipophilic
binding site of adh.  xxxd2821xxx  and ethanol have similar
turnover numbers for the form of cytochrome p-450 which is
induced by chronic treatment with ethanol [33]; therefore, the
effect of  xxxd2777xxx  on  xxxd2821xxx  metabolism in the perfused
liver was studied. rates of 4-nitrocatechol formation from

the presence of methanol or ethanol plus  xxxd2148xxx ; therefore,
for efficient data collection, ethanol plus  xxxd2148xxx  was used
to determine rates of h 2 0 2 production from all  xxxd2154xxx  studied
except for  xxxd2777xxx  and palmitate, where methanol was utilized. all
rates were corrected for vaporization from the perfusion system (less
than 10%). (c) rates of h2o2 generation from peroxisomal fi-oxidation of  xxxd2154xxx  by liver homogenates were measured as described

more than an order of magnitude lower than rates of ethanol

decreased rates of hydroxylation of  xxxd2821xxx  to
0.13 f 0.04 pmol g-' h - ' and the subsequent infusion of
 xxxd2777xxx  (0.5 mm) did not affect these rates (data not shown).
similar results were obtained with aniline in a previous study
[15]. these data are consistent with the facts that  xxxd2777xxx  decreased mixed-function oxidation by decreasing nadph

480
a

supply [44]and that acyl coa compounds are inhibitors of
cytochrome p-450with inhibitor constants in the micromolar
range [44,45].thus, it was concluded that cytochrome p-450
was not involved in the stimulation of ethanol uptake by fatty
acids.
to examine whether or not  xxxd2154xxx  displaced  xxxd2148xxx  from  xxxg110xxx , the effect of  xxxd2777xxx  on
rates of ethanol elimination was studied in perfused livers
from adh-negative deermice. basal rates of ethanol elimination of 49 f 4 pmol g-' h-' were increased by  xxxd2777xxx  to
75 f 4 pmol g-' h-' (n = 5; p < 0.05). thus,  xxxd2777xxx  stimulates ethanol metabolism in a mutant lacking  xxxg110xxx . moreover,  xxxd2154xxx  inhibit  xxxg110xxx 
directly [39,40]. thus, it was concluded that fatty-acid-stimulated ethanol uptake was not due to displacement of 4methypyrazole from adh by  xxxd2154xxx .
 xxxd2298xxx  can be generated from  xxxd2154xxx 
at high rates for  xxxg345xxx -dependent ethanol metabolism

i

\

the above data (i.e., sensitivity to the  xxxg345xxx  inhibitor,
aminotriazole) suggested that  xxxg345xxx , and not cytochrome
p-450or adh, was involved in the mechanism of fatty-acidstimulated ethanol metabolism. this was supported recently
by the calculation that only 3-8% of ethanol metabolism
occurs via the  xxxd102xxx inducible form of cytochrome p-450

1611.
peroxidation of ethanol via  xxxg345xxx , which occurs at rates
of 60- 80 pmol g-' h-', is limited by the supply of h 2 0 2[6];
therefore, rates of h 2 0 2 generation in the presence of fatty
acids must proceed at least as quickly. however, it was reported previously that rates of endogenous fatty-acid-stimulated
h 2 0 2 production in perfused rat livers were more than an
order of magnitude lower than rates of ethanol uptake [7].
for example, endogenous rates of h 2 0 2generation were only
about 4 pmol g-' h-' and were increased only 2 - 3-fold by
infusion of low concentrations of octanoate [7].similar results
were reported by foerster et al. [i71with low concentrations
of  xxxd2777xxx  (0.01 -0.2 mm). these studies have led to the belief
that  xxxg345xxx  is a minor pathway of ethanol oxidation [9].to
attempt to understand the discrepancy between rates of h 2 0 2
generation reported previously and rates of fatty-acid-dependent ethanol metabolism, rates of h z 0 2generation were measured in the presence of physiological concentrations of fatty
acids. oshino et al. [7]developed a method to quantify rates
of h 2 0 2 generation in livers perfused in a nonrecirculating
system, based on the concentration of methanol required to
destroy half the  xxxg345xxx -h202 (fig. 2). to quantify rates
of h z 0 2 generation, the level of  xxxg345xxx -h202, measured
spectrophotometrically (660- 640 nm) through a lobe of the
liver, corresponding to maximal fractional saturation of
 xxxg345xxx -heme with h 2 0 2 was determined by infusing
 xxxd2219xxx  (1 mm) to generate excess h 2 0 2 . subsequently,
methanol was infused at concentrations varying from 0.1 to
20 mm to decrease levels of  xxxg345xxx -h202 in the liver. the
results of a typical experiment are depicted in fig. 2a. in the
absence of exogenous substrates, about 40% of the  xxxg345xxx 
heme was saturated with h 2 0 2 . as the methanol concentration was increased, the steady-state level of  xxxg345xxx -h202
decreased to zero due to peroxidation of methanol by catalaseh 2 0 2 . under these conditions and in the absence of fatty
acids, about 0.13 mm methanol was required to decrease the
steady-state level of  xxxg345xxx -h202 by 50%, corresponding to
rates of h 2 0 2generation of 6 f 1 pmol g-' h-' (n = 4). in

of 23 f 5 pmol g-' h-' (p< 0.05). thus, even with physiological concentrations of  xxxd2154xxx , rates of ethanol oxidation
are 3 -4-fold greater than rates of h202production.
an important difference between measurement of rates of
h 2 0 2 generation in the nonrecirculating system and rates
of fatty-acid-dependent ethanol uptake in the recirculating
system was that the albumin concentration in the nonrecirculating system (1.7%) was less than half of that employed
in the recirculating system (4%). when 4% bovine serum
albumin was included in the perfusate in the nonrecirculating
system, basal rates of h 2 0 2generation were around 13 pmol

of h 2 0 2generation caused by hormones or  xxxd2154xxx  bound
to the albumin. under these conditions, addition of  xxxd2777xxx 
(1 mm) increased rates of h202production to around
60 pmol g- h-' (fig. 2b). since fatty acid uptake is partially
mediated by receptors for albumin on plasma membranes

fasted rats (n = 26) perfused in the absence (+) and presence of

( a ) , laurate; (u), xxxd2681xxx ; (a),palmitate; ( o ) , xxxd2777xxx , (*), stearate.
data is from fig. 1 . the line of best-fit and correlation coefficient
were derived from least-squares linear regression analysis of the data

peroxisomal 8-oxidation [36,37], decreased h 2 0 2production
from  xxxd2777xxx  by about 50% (table 2) but did not affect rates of
ketone body (acetoacetate
p-hydroxybutyrate) formation
(data not shown). these data indicate that the h 2 0 2measured
under these conditions is generated via peroxisomal and not
mitochondrial p-oxidation.
the effect of varying the chain length of fatty acid on
hzoz generation was examined in perfused livers. rates of
hzoz generation were not increased significantly by hexanoate (6:o; fig. 1 b). in contrast, octanoate (8: 0) and  xxxd1821xxx  (10: 0) increased rates significantly to about 55 and
65 pmol g-' h - ' respectively, and maximal rates of about
85 pmol g-' h-' were observed with laurate (12:o).  xxxd2681xxx 
(14:o) and palmitate (16:o) also increased rates to between
70 and 75 pmol g-' h-' (fig. 1b) while values were about
60 pmol g-' h-' with  xxxd2777xxx  (18: l), although stearate (18:0),
the saturated fatty acid of corresponding chain length, only
increased rates about 10 pmol g-' h-' above basal values
(fig. ib). erucate (22:3) only increased rates to about
22 pmol g-' h-'. thus, rates of hzoz production corresponded well with rates of  xxxd2148xxx -insensitive ethanol oxidation (fig. 1a). indeed, there was an excellent correlation ( r = 0.99) between rates of h 2 0 2 generation and 4methylpyrazole-insensitive ethanol uptake in the presence and
absence of various  xxxd2154xxx  (fig. 4). also, rates of h 2 0 2
production by homogenates exhibited identical chain-length
specificities (fig. 1c). these data demonstrate conclusively
that rates of h 2 0 2 generation can indeed support peroxidation of ethanol via  xxxg345xxx -h202at rates of up to 80 pmol
g-' h-' and are consistent with the hyrothesis that methylpyrazole-insensitive ethanol metabolism is limited by the
supply of h 2 0 2generated from peroxisomal p-oxidation.
several previous studies investigating the quantitative role
of  xxxg345xxx -h202 in hepatic ethanol metabolism did not include  xxxd2154xxx  [49- 511; thus, rates of h 2 0 2generation and
the subsequent peroxidation of ethanol via  xxxg345xxx -h202
were minimal. however, when rates of h 2 0 2generation were
optimized by addition of millimolar concentrations of fatty
acids bound to albumin (table l),  xxxg345xxx -h202 supported

+

ethanol metabolism at very high rates (fig. 1). studies with
perfused livers from adh-positive and adh-negative
deermice gave similar conclusions. rates of h 2 0 2 generation
of 60-65 pmol g-' h - ' were quite close to rates of ethanol
uptake of about 60pmol g-' h-' observed in the adhnegative deermouse [55]. thus, high rates of h 2 0 2generation
in adh-negative deermice, generated presumably via
peroxisomal p-oxidation of endogenous  xxxd2154xxx , can support equivalent rates of ethanol metabolism. these conclusions contrast with conclusions from reports where the
 xxxg345xxx  inhibitor, aminotriazole, did not decrease rates of
ethanol elimination in vivo [52 - 541; however, these previous
studies did not control for the extent of inhibition of the
peroxide-forming activity of  xxxg345xxx  by monitoring catalaseh 2 0 2 . when  xxxg345xxx  was effectively inhibited by aminotriazole, as demonstrated by a lack of effect of ethanol on
 xxxg345xxx -h202 measured continuously in the perfused liver,
rates of ethanol elimination were decreased significantly [32].
because the contribution of  xxxg345xxx -h202to hepatic ethanol
metabolism has previously been underestimated, due to submaximal rates of h 2 0 2generation, more work will be needed
in the future to quantify the role of  xxxg345xxx -h202in ethanol
oxidation under physiological conditions in the presence of
 xxxd2154xxx . however, the above data indicate that catalaseh 2 0 2 can be a major pathway of ethanol metabolism in the
presence of physiological concentrations of  xxxd2154xxx .
factors influencing peroxisomal p-oxidation in the intact liver

the perfused rat liver is a model in which cellular integrity
is maintained and allows the study of peroxisomal function
under conditions approximating those found in vivo. as such,
it is a good model in which to study both peroxisomal and
mitochondrial p-oxidation.
it is generally believed that peroxisomal p-oxidation is
important only in the oxidation of very  xxxd2154xxx 
(i.e. erucate [ss]). this belief arose from observations that
isolated peroxisomes and peroxisomal preparations oxidized
very  xxxd2154xxx  which are poor substrates for mitochondria [58, 601. however, little is known about the quantitative contribution of medium-chain and long-chain fatty
acids as opposed to very  xxxd2154xxx  in this system.
the present studies show clearly that octanoate (presumably
as  xxxd2768xxx ) can be metabolized very rapidly via
peroxisomal p-oxidation in homogenates and in perfused liver
(fig. 1).furthermore, physiological  xxxd2154xxx  such as palmitate are oxidized about fourfold faster than very long-chain
 xxxd2154xxx  such as erucate (fig. 1). thus, while very longchain  xxxd2154xxx  are indeed substrates for oxidation via
peroxisomal p-oxidation in intact cells, they are metabolized
at slower rates than are short-chain to medium-chain fatty
acids in peroxisomes in intact hepatocytes.
several factors may regulate peroxisomal p-oxidation. it
has been reported that the rate-limiting step in peroxisomal
p-oxidation in isolated peroxisomes is the acyl-coa oxidase
[59]. the chain-length specificity of h 2 0 2 production from
saturated  xxxd2154xxx  observed in the present study in both
homogenates and perfused livers (fig. 1) was similar to that
reported for fatty acyl-coa compounds in peroxisomes isolated from brown adipose tissue of cold-adapted rats [59]. these
data indicate that the chain-length specificity for  xxxd2154xxx 
of the acyl-coa oxidase influences rates of peroxisomal poxidation in the intact organ.
to investigate the effect of increasing the amount of acylcoa oxidase activity in the liver on rates of peroxisomal p-

oxidation, livers from rats treated with ciprofibrate for 5 days
were perfused and rates of acetoacetate and p-hydroxybutyrate production and h 2 0 2 generation were measured.
treatment of rats with ciprofibrate increased hepatic activity
of acyl-coa oxidase by 400% (data not shown). basal rates
of h 2 0 2generation were about twofold greater in livers from
control than in livers from ciprofibrate-treated rats (15 f 1
compared to 7 & 1 pmol g-' h-' respectively); however,
 xxxd2777xxx  increased rates of h 2 0 2 generation significantly (to
75 pmol g- ' h- ') in livers from ciprofibrate-treated rats compared to controls (p< 0.01 ; table 3). the fact that increasing
acyl-coa oxidase activity fourfold did not increase fatty-acidstimulated h 2 0 2 generation demonstrates that the absolute
activity of acyl-coa oxidase is not rate-limiting in hepatic
peroxisomal p-oxidation.
it is now recognized that the supply of fatty acid is a major
determinant in mitochondrial p-oxidation in the liver [3]. to
determine if fatty acid supply is important in peroxisomal
8-oxidation, rates of peroxisomal and mitochondrial p-oxidation of  xxxd2777xxx  were estimated by measuring rates of h 2 0 2
generation and ketone body formation, respectively, as a function of fatty acid concentration. to make such calculations,
it was assumed first that acetyl-coa produced by mitochondrial p-oxidation is utilized predominantly for ketone
body production, and second, that acetyl-coa produced by
peroxisomal p-oxidation enters the mitochondria and forms
ketone bodies at minimal rates. the first assumption is validated by the observation that about 90% of the acetyl-coa from
exogenous palmitate which was oxidized was recovered in
ketone bodies in isolated hepatocytes [4]. the second assumption is supported by the observation that an inhibitor of
mitochondrial and peroxisomal  xxxg513xxx ,
(+)-acetyl carnitine, did not affect ketone body formation
from exogenous  xxxd2777xxx  or palmitate in isolated hepatocytes
[571.
the curve for ketone body formation versus the concentration of  xxxd2777xxx  added was hyperbolic, with near-maximal

in
the presence of  xxxd2777xxx  (0.0125-2.0 mm) were calculated from the
time necessary for in the steady-state level of  xxxg345xxx -hzo2to return
to basal values after the addition of methanol (10 mm). rates of
ketone body (acetoacetate + /?-hydroxybutyrate) production
(0-0)
were calculated from changes in the concentrations of
acetoacetate and 1-hydroxybutyratein the perfusate over 20 - 30 min
of perfusion. each point represents data from a separate liver. basal
rates of ketone body production and h z 0 2generation were 33 f 5
and 12 f 5 pmol g ' h ' respectively

rates of ketone body formation observed with 0.5 mm  xxxd2777xxx ;
maximal rates of about 90 pmol g-' h-' were observed with
2.0 mm  xxxd2777xxx  (fig. 5). rates of ketogenesis determined from
double-reciprocal plots were half-maximal with about
0.13 mm  xxxd2777xxx . in contrast, the curve for h 2 0 2generation
from  xxxd2777xxx  was sigmoidal (fig. 5). rates of h z 0 2generation
were minimal below 0.5 mm  xxxd2777xxx , were half-maximal with
about 0.65 mm  xxxd2777xxx , and reached maximal values of about
60 pmol g-' h-' at concentrations of  xxxd2777xxx  above 1 mm.
the fact that h 2 0 2generation from  xxxd2777xxx  was only observed
at significant rates at concentrations where ketone body formation was maximal (fig. 5 ) is consistent with the hypothesis
that fatty acyl-coa compounds are transported preferentially
into the mitochondria at low concentrations of  xxxd2154xxx .
once transport of acyl-coa into the mitochondria is saturated, acyl-coa compounds move into peroxisomes and
h 2 0 2is generated via peroxisomal p-oxidation. these data
support the hypothesis that substrate supply is an important
rate-limiting factor in peroxisomal fatty acid metabolism. in
support of this hypothesis, when the concentration of albumin
in the perfusate was decreased, leading presumably to
diminished rates of fatty acid uptake, rates of h 2 0 2 generation were reduced by over 50% (table 2; fig. 2 ) .
at low concentrations (< 0.5 mm) of  xxxd2777xxx , fatty acid
oxidation occurred almost exclusively in the mitochondria as
reflected by high rates of ketone body production (fig. 5 ) ;
however, at high concentrations of  xxxd2777xxx  (1 .o - 2.0 mm),
acetyl units were produced at a rate of about 180 pmol g-'
h - l via mitochondrial p-oxidation (2 acetyl units/ketone body
formed) while 60 pmol g- h- were formed via peroxisomal
p-oxidation (one acetyl unit/h202;fig. 5). under these conditions, w-oxidation of  xxxd2154xxx  is probably minimal since
ciprofibrate, which is a potent inducer of o-oxidation, had
little effect on rates of ketone body formation (table 3). thus,
flux through peroxisomal 8-oxidation was estimated to be

' '

484

about 25% of the total rates of hepatic fatty acid oxidation
at high concentrations of  xxxd2154xxx  in the perfused liver. this
calculation agrees well with a previous report by kondrup
and lazarow [56]who estimated that peroxisomal j?-oxidation
accounts for about one-third of total palmitate oxidation
in isolated hepatocytes. these data demonstrate that in the
presence of physiological concentrations of  xxxd2154xxx ,
peroxisomal p-oxidation is a significant pathway of fatty acid
oxidation.
