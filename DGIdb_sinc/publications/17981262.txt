introduction

patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd), including
crohn’s disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc) have an
increased risk for the development of colorectal cancer (crc),
that is influenced in part by the duration and anatomical
extent of the disease, as well as by the severity of the ongoing
inflammation [1]. present crc management techniques in ibd
patients include surveillance colonoscopy and/or colectomy,
but such strategies have not yet been proven to reduce
mortality [1]. the development of safe and effective chemopreventive measures for reducing the risk of crc would thus
be of substantial benefit to ibd patients.
several experimental animal studies, large retrospective
and prospective population-based studies indicate that
regular intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

(nsaids) may reduce the risk of developing polyps and
sporadic crc, and may induce the regression of adenomas
in familial adenomatous polyposis (fap) [2–8]. a major
molecular target for crc chemoprevention by these agents
is the cyclooxygenase (cox) [2,3]. cox transforms arachidonic
acid into prostaglandin (pg)g2, an unstable intermediate
which is rapidly converted to pgh2. subsequently, pgh2 is
metabolized into different structurally related pg, including
pge2,  xxxg1073xxx , pgf2, pgi2 and thromboxane a2 [9]. cox-1 is the
constitutive isoform of this enzyme, and is expressed in a wide
range of mammalian tissues. it functions as a housekeeping
gene that controls the production of prostacyclins, pg and
tromboxane, which are essential for physiological functions,
such as protection of gastric mucosa, platelet aggregation and
dynamics of the renal microvasculature. in contrast, cox-2 is
constitutively expressed in human kidney and brain, and it is

inducible by inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, oncogenes, serum and tumour promoters in several cell types [9,10].
cox-1 expression remains unaltered in crc, whereas increased
levels of cox-2 have been seen in 50% of colorectal adenomas
and in up to 85% of sporadic crc [10,11]. evidence also suggests
that cox-2 could play a role in the pathogenesis of crc
complicating the natural history of patients with ibd [12,13].
the clinical relevance of these observations relates to the
demonstration that specific pharmacological inhibition or
genetic ablation of cox-2 can prevent the development of crc
and can even cause regression of existing adenomatous
polyps in both humans and rodents [3,14]. moreover, blockade
of cox-2 associates with a reduced frequency of colitis-driven
crc in mice [13]. it has been postulated that the antitumor
effect of nsaids, including cox-2 inhibitors, is mediated
through reduction in pg production, most notably pge2, which
is frequently overexpressed in crc tissues [2,3]. nonetheless,
more recent studies suggest that the role of cox-2 in the
pathogenesis of crc may be more complex than that indicated
by initial studies. in fact, various cox-independent targets of
nsaids have been described, as well as there is evidence that
some agents that induce cox-2 are chemopreventive [15,16].
unfortunately, the wide spread use of nsaids and cox-2
inhibitors in the chemoprevention of crc has been limited by
their frequent and often severe side effects [17,18]. moreover,
because nsaids may aggravate the symptoms of colitis, their
sustained use for the purpose of cancer chemoprevention is
relatively contraindicated in ibd patients [19]. thus, there is a
need to identify alternative chemopreventive agents that are
more appropriate for use in ibd patients.
 xxxd2579xxx  is a 5- xxxd153xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx ) compound
largely used for maintaining remission, as well as in the
treatment of mildly flare-ups in ibd.  xxxd2579xxx  is safe and free of
serious adverse effects. recent epidemiological studies suggest
that long-term consumption of  xxxd2579xxx  reduces the risk of crc
developing in patients with ibd [12,20,21]. additionally, several
experimental studies have shown that  xxxd2579xxx  markedly reduces
the growth and survival of crc cells [22–25]. in this context, we
have previously shown that  xxxd2579xxx  inhibits epidermal growth
factor receptor (egfr) activation, a transmembrane tyrosine
kinase which triggers mitogenic signalling in crc cells [26].
moreover, bos et al. showed that  xxxd2579xxx  affects the wnt/bcatenin pathway in crc cells via the inhibition of the
phosphatase 2a, and degradation of b-catenin [27]. finally,
rousseaux et al. demonstrated that  xxxd2579xxx  interacts with and
enhances the expression and activation of ppar-g, a negative
regulator of colonic inflammation and cancer [28]. despite these
advances, the precise mechanisms by which  xxxd2579xxx  inhibits crc
cell growth have not been fully established. in this study, we
have analyzed if  xxxd2579xxx  inhibits cox-2/pge2 axis in crc cells
and evaluated whether the regulatory effects of  xxxd2579xxx  on crc
cells are strictly dependent on the control of this pathway.

ph of the drug solution was adjusted to 7.4 with naoh, and
experiments carried out protected from light. all reagents
were from sigma–aldrich (milan, italy) unless specified. the
human crc cell lines, ht-29 and dld1, were maintained in
mccoy’s 5a and rpmi 1640 medium, respectively, both
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs), 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 50 mg/ml  xxxd2193xxx . the human
crc cell line ht-115 was maintained in dmem medium
supplemented with 15% fbs and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
to examine whether  xxxd2579xxx  affects cox-2 expression, cells
were cultured in appropriate media supplemented with fbs
and antibiotics in 12-well culture dishes. after reaching 60–
70% confluence, cells were starved for 12 h. non-adherent
cells were then removed and fresh medium containing 0.05%
bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) was added to each well. cultures
were performed in the presence or absence of  xxxd2579xxx  (5–
30 mm) or equivalent concentrations of mannitol for 24 h.
additionally, to evaluate whether  xxxd2579xxx  was able to reduce
the expression of cox-2 induced by pro-inflammatory
cytokines, serum starved ht-29 cells were pre-incubated with
15 mm  xxxd2579xxx  for 1 h and then treated with  xxxg2296xxx  or il-1b
(10 ng/ml, r&d systems, minneapolis, mn, usa) for 1–5 h. in
parallel, cells were pre-incubated with cycloheximide (10 mg/
ml, sigma–aldrich) for 1 h prior to adding  xxxd2579xxx . at the end,
cells were harvested and used for extracting total proteins or
rna.

methods and materials

2.1.

cell culture

 xxxd2579xxx  was kindly provided by giuliani s.p.a. (milan, italy) and
dissolved as a 100 mm stock solution in culture medium. the

cell proliferation

cell proliferation was assessed by using carboxyfluorescein
diacetate succinimidyl ester (cfse; molecular probes, eugene,
or, usa), which covalently binds cell components to yield a
fluorescence that is divided equally between daughter cells
at each division. single-cell suspensions were plated at
2 105 cells/ml/well in six-well culture dishes and allowed to
adhere overnight. cells were then labelled with cfse
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. after 30 min,
the medium was removed and fresh media containing 0.05%
bsa, and the desired concentrations of the test compounds
were added and incubated for further 24 h. at the end, cells
were collected, washed twice with pbs 1, and then
incubated with 5 mg/ml of  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (pi) for 15 min,
at 4 8c in the dark. cfse and/or pi-positive cells were
determined by flow-cytometry (becton dickinson, facscalibur, milan, italy) and the data were analyzed using modfit lt
2.0 (verity software house inc., me, usa). to examine
whether exogenous pge2 were able to revert the 5-asamediated anti-proliferative effect on ht-115, cfse-labelled
cells were pre-incubated with 1 mg/ml pge2 (sigma–aldrich)
for 1 h prior to adding 5–30 mm  xxxd2579xxx . after 24 h, the
percentage of proliferating cells was evaluated by flow
cytometry.

analysis and quantification of cell death

to score cell death, cells were either left untreated or
treated with increasing doses of  xxxd2579xxx  (5–30 mm) for
24–48 h. cells were then collected, washed twice in pbs
1, stained with fitc- xxxg166xxx  (av, 1:100 final dilution)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (becton

4 8c, and their fluorescence was measured using fl-1
and fl-2 channels of facscalibur using cell quest pro
software.

2.4.

cox-2 is over-expressed in the vast majority of crc, and
inhibition of cox-2 in crc cells results in a decreased growth
and survival [2,6–8]. therefore, cox-2 may represent an
important target for crc chemoprevention. however, there
is evidence that various nsaids, including selective cox-2
inhibitors, can regulate crc cell activity by modulating also
cox-2-independent pathways [15,29]. as a starting point for
our studies, we evaluated whether  xxxd2579xxx  regulates the
proliferation and survival of ht-115, a crc cell line which
expresses cox-2. to this end, we used the intracellular
fluorescent label cfse to tag the proliferating cells, and
therefore to determine the proliferation history of specific cell
populations. as illustrated in fig. 1a,  xxxd2579xxx  significantly and
dose-dependently inhibited the percentage of cfse-labelled
cells after 24 h culture. no significant change in cell growth
was seen in mannitol-treated cells (not shown). we next

pge2 assay

ht-115 cells were plated at 4 103 cells/well in 96-well culture
dishes in dmem medium containing 0.5% fbs and allowed to
adhere overnight. cells were treated with graded doses of 5asa (15–30 mm) or mannitol (30 mm) for 22 h, and pge2
secretion was then measured by a commercially available
elisa kit (r&d systems).

western blotting

total proteins were extracted using the following lysis buffer:
10 mmol/l hepes, 1 mmol/l edta, 60 mmol/l kcl, 0.2% igepal
ca-630, 1 mmol/l sodium fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/
ml leupeptin, 1 mmol/l dtt and 1 mmol/l pmsf, separated on
an 10% sds-page gel, and blots were then incubated with a
mouse anti-human monoclonal cox-1 or cox-2 antibody (sc19998 and sc-19999, respectively; 1:500 final dilution, santa
cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca, usa) followed by a rabbit
anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase
(1:20,000 final dilution). after analysis of cox-1 and cox-2
each blot was stripped and incubated with a mouse-antihuman monoclonal b-actin antibody (1:5000) to ascertain
equivalent loading of the lanes. computer-assisted scanning
densitometry (total lab, ab.el science-ware srl, rome, italy)
was used to analyze the intensity of the immunoreactive
bands.

rna extraction, cdna preparation and real-time pcr

analysis of cox-1 and cox-2 rna expression was performed by real-time pcr. total rna was extracted from cells
by using trizol reagent, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (invitrogen, milan, italy). a constant amount of
rna (1 mg/sample) was retro-transcribed into complementary dna (cdna) and 1 ml of cdna/sample was then
amplified using the following conditions: denaturation
1 min at 95 8c, annealing 30 s at 62 8c for cox-2 and b-actin
or 30 s at 58 8c for cox-1, followed by 30 s of extension at
72 8c. primers sequence was as follows: cox-2, fwd: 50 -ttc

assessed whether the  xxxd2579xxx -induced crc cell growth arrest
was accompanied by any change on cell death. a time-course
analysis of  xxxd2579xxx  effect on the percentage of av and/or pipositive cells showed that 24 h treatment with  xxxd2579xxx  resulted
in no increase in cell death compared with untreated cells
(data not shown). analysis at later time points (i.e. 48 h)
revealed however that  xxxd2579xxx  dose-dependently reduced the
survival of ht-115 cells (fig. 1b). in particular, by flowcytometry it was shown that  xxxd2579xxx  significantly enhanced the
fraction of av-positive/pi-negative cells (16.3  7.6 and
19.5  8.1% in cells treated with 15 and 30 mm  xxxd2579xxx ,
respectively, versus 7.15  4.7% in untreated cells; p < 0.04
and p = 0.01, respectively), while no significant increase was
seen in cells treated with 5 mm  xxxd2579xxx  (10.7  4.6%). moreover,
 xxxd2579xxx  significantly enhanced the percentage of av-positive
and pi-positive cells (23.2  7, 29  10 and 32.1  12.2% in cells
treated with 5, 15 and 30 mm  xxxd2579xxx  versus 10.7  4.6% in
untreated cells, p < 0.02). finally, a significant increase in avnegative/pi-positive cells was seen in cultures added with
30 mm (24.4  8.6%, p < 0.04) but not 15 mm (18.4  6.3%) or
5 mm (10.5  3.5%)  xxxd2579xxx  compared to untreated cultures
(7.65  1.5%).
these results collectively suggest that the  xxxd2579xxx -mediated
block in cell growth precedes the induction of death.

analyzed by western blotting. one of three representative
western blots is shown. (b) quantitative analysis of cox2/b-actin protein ratio in total extracts of ht-115 cells

in subsequent experiments, we evaluated whether the ability
of  xxxd2579xxx  to regulate ht-115 cell growth and survival was
associated with changes in the expression/activity of cox-2.
for this purpose, we treated ht-115 cells with graded doses of
 xxxd2579xxx  for 24 h, and then total extracts were analyzed for cox2 expression by western blotting. cox-2 was detectable in
unstimulated cells and was down-regulated by  xxxd2579xxx  (fig. 2a
and b). cox-2 expression quantitated by densitometry and
normalized by b-actin expression was significantly reduced in
ht-115 cells treated with 15 and 30 mm  xxxd2579xxx  (fig. 2b, p < 0.04
and p < 0.03, respectively) but not in cells treated with 5 mm 5asa (fig. 2b). mannitol (30 mm) did not alter cox-2 protein
expression (fig. 2a and b). by contrast,  xxxd2579xxx  did not alter the
expression of cox-1 in ht-115, and this was evident at rna
(not showed) and protein level (fig. 2c).
cox-2 enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of pge2 [9,10]. to
examine whether the  xxxd2579xxx -mediated down-regulation of
cox-2 was biologically active, we measured the level of pge2
in the culture supernatants of cells either left untreated or
treated with 15 and 30 mm  xxxd2579xxx . as shown in fig. 2d, both
doses of  xxxd2579xxx  significantly reduced the pge2 secretion by ht115 cells. no reduction in pge2 secretion was seen in
mannitol-treated cells, indicating that the effect of  xxxd2579xxx 

representative western blots is shown. (d)  xxxd2579xxx  inhibits

expressed as pg per 100 mg total protein of cell
supernatants, and indicate the mean w s.d. of three
separate experiments.

on pge2 secretion was not due to osmolarity shifts into the
culture medium.

3.3.
 xxxd2579xxx  negatively regulates the expression of cox-2
induced by  xxxg2296xxx  and il-1b in ht-29 cells
since cox-2 expression is positively regulated by inflammatory cytokines, such as  xxxg2296xxx  and interleukin (il)-1b that are
supposed to play a pathogenic role in ibd [30–32], we next
examined if  xxxd2579xxx  was able to inhibit the  xxxg2296xxx  and il-1bmediated induction of cox-2. to this end, cox-2 analysis was
performed in ht-29 cells, since these cells lines are known to
functionally respond to  xxxg2296xxx  and il-1b with enhanced
induction of cox-2 [30,31]. ht-29 cells were pre-incubated
with 15 mm  xxxd2579xxx  for 1 h and then treated with  xxxg2296xxx  and  xxxg1170xxx  for 5 h. western blotting analysis of total extracts showed
that cox-2 expression was increased by  xxxg2296xxx  and il-1b
(fig. 3a and b). importantly,  xxxd2579xxx  significantly reduced the
expression of cox-2 induced by both  xxxg2296xxx  and il-1b. to
confirm further these results, we assessed whether  xxxd2579xxx  also
inhibited the cytokine-induced cox-2 rna expression. by
real-time pcr it was shown that cox-2 mrna was increased
in ht-29 cells stimulated by  xxxg2296xxx  (fig. 3c) or il-1b (not
shown). induction of cox-2 rna was maximal at 1 h and
remained elevated at 2 h. notably, treatment of cells with 5asa markedly reduced the cox-2 rna expression induced by
 xxxg2296xxx  (fig. 3c) or il-1b (not shown), and this was evident at
each time point analyzed. moreover, pre-incubation of ht-29
cells with cycloheximide did not revert the  xxxd2579xxx -mediated
inhibition of  xxxg2296xxx -induced cox-2 rna expression (fig. 3d).

to examine if the  xxxd2579xxx -induced anti-proliferative effect on
ht-115 was strictly dependent on the inhibition of cox-2/
pge2 axis, cells were treated with graded doses of  xxxd2579xxx  in the
presence or absence of exogenous pge2. the addition of pge2
to ht-115 cells cultured in the absence of  xxxd2579xxx  slightly but
not significantly increased the fraction of proliferating cells.
notably pge2 reverted neither the block in growth (fig. 4) nor
the induction of death (not shown) in  xxxd2579xxx -treated ht-115
cells. however, pge2 enhances the phosphorylation of egfr in
ht-115 cells thus indicating that it was active in our systems.

3.5.
 xxxd2579xxx  inhibits the growth but does not enhance the
death of dld-1, a cox-2-deficient crc cell line
overall the above results suggest that  xxxd2579xxx  exerts its antiproliferative effects through a mechanism that is not entirely
dependent on the inhibition of cox-2/pge2 pathway. to test
further this hypothesis, we analyzed the effect of  xxxd2579xxx  on
growth and death of dld-1, a cox-2-deficient crc cell line
[33]. for this purposes, cfse-labelled dld1 cells were treated
absence of cycloheximide for 30 min, followed by
stimulation with or without  xxxd2579xxx  for 1 h and then  xxxg2296xxx 
for further 2 h. levels are normalized to b-actin. values are

were pre-incubated with pge2 for 1 h prior to adding 5–

cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. data indicate
mean w s.d. of five different experiments.

with increasing doses of  xxxd2579xxx  for 24 h, and then the fraction
of proliferating cells was evaluated by flow-cytometry. as
shown in fig. 5a,  xxxd2579xxx  dose-dependently inhibited dld-1 cell
growth. by contrast,  xxxd2579xxx  did not affect the viability of these
cells both at 48 h (fig. 5b) and later time points (data not
shown). dld-1 cells are known to have undetectable level of
cox-1, even though a previously published study showed that
these cells can express cox-1 rna [34]. therefore, to confirm
that the anti-proliferative effect of  xxxd2579xxx  on dld-1 was cox
independent, we assessed the effect of  xxxd2579xxx  on cox-1
expression in these cells. cox-1 rna transcripts were evident
in dld-1 but remained unchanged following  xxxd2579xxx  treatment
(fig. 5c). by contrast, no cox-1 protein was seen regardless of
whether dld-1 were treated or not with  xxxd2579xxx  (fig. 5d).

discussion

this study was undertaken to examine whether the ability of
 xxxd2579xxx  to regulate crc cell growth and death is strictly
dependent on the inhibition of cox-2, the inducible form of
cox, whose expression is up-regulated in the inflamed gut of
patients with ibd [35] and in the majority of neoplastic lesions
of the colon [11]. we first show that  xxxd2579xxx  inhibits the growth
of ht-115, a crc cell line that expresses a functionally active
cox-2, and this anti-mitogenic effect of  xxxd2579xxx  is associated
with a marked down-regulation of cox-2 at the protein and
rna level. consistently, secretion of pge2 by ht-115 is
significantly reduced by  xxxd2579xxx . second,  xxxd2579xxx  inhibits the
expression of cox-2 induced in ht-29 cells by inflammatory
cytokines, such as  xxxg2296xxx  and il-1b. such an effect is direct and
not mediated by de novo protein synthesis, because preincubation of cells with cycloheximide does not prevent the
down-regulation of cox-2 induced by  xxxd2579xxx  in  xxxg2296xxx -treated
cells.
the exact molecular mechanism by which  xxxd2579xxx  inhibits
cox-2 expression remains to be ascertained. multiple signalling pathways have been reported to modulate cox-2
induction in crc cells. for example, inflammatory cytokines
can enhance cox-2 gene transcription by promoting map

cox-deficient dld-1 cells. cfse-labelled dld-1 were
either left unstimulated (unst) or treated with graded

death. dld-1 cells were either left unstimulated (unst) or

percentage of cell death as assessed by facs analysis of

kinase and  xxxg1559xxx  activation [36]. it is also known that drugs
that reduce  xxxg1368xxx  activity may destabilize cox-2
rna [37]. since it is known that  xxxd2579xxx  inhibit such pathways
in epithelial cells [38], it is plausible that the  xxxd2579xxx -mediated
negative regulation of cox-2 may be in part due to the control
of map kinase and  xxxg1559xxx  activity. another possibility is that 5asa may suppress cox-2 through the negative regulation of
egfr activation and/or apc/b-catenin pathway [26,27,39].
finally, it is also possible that  xxxd2579xxx  interferes with the rate of
protein synthesis and/or proteasome-mediated degradation of
cox-2 [40].
the fact that  xxxd2579xxx -mediated arrest of ht-115 cell
proliferation occurs at doses that are lower than those
required to suppress cox-2 (5 mm) and that exogenously
added pge2 does not revert the inhibitory effect of  xxxd2579xxx  on
ht-115 cell growth however suggest that the effect of  xxxd2579xxx 
on crc cell growth is partially independent of cox-2/pge2
inhibition. this is supported further by the demonstration that
 xxxd2579xxx  also decreases the growth of dld-1, a crc cell line that
does not express cox protein and therefore does not produce
pge2.
time-course analysis of av and pi-positive cells in
cultures added with  xxxd2579xxx  also reveals that ht-115 cells
undergo death following  xxxd2579xxx  exposure. this phenomenon
is seen however only after 48 h stimulation with  xxxd2579xxx , and
therefore it follows and does not precede the 5-asamediated cell growth arrest. these data exclude therefore
the possibility that the anti-proliferative action of  xxxd2579xxx  is
due to a toxic effect of the drug.  xxxd2579xxx  is thus different from
other traditional nsaids that have been used for chemoprevention in crc, as these agents inhibit the growth of crc
cells by mostly promoting apoptosis [33]. we also show that
 xxxd2579xxx  does not reduce the survival of dld-1, raising the
possibility that the lack of cox-2 may limit the susceptibility
of dld-1 cells to undergo apoptosis. this finding is not
totally unexpected, given that previous studies have shown
that sc-58125, a cox-2 antagonist, induces apoptosis in hras-transformed rie cells that express cox-2 but not in the
non-transformed parental control cells that do not express
cox-2 [41]. a key question arising from these studies is how
the inhibition of cox may induce apoptosis. a possibility is
that inhibition of cox results in the accumulation of the pg
precursor  xxxd208xxx , which would in turn stimulate
the conversion of sphingomyelin to ceramide, thereby
triggering apoptotic signals [42]. in this context, it is however
noteworthy that other nsaids, including  xxxd3260xxx 
and  xxxd2969xxx , are effective in inducing apoptosis and
inhibiting proliferation in cells lacking cox-2 [33], thus
suggesting that inhibition of cox-2 is not an essential
requirement for the induction of crc cell death by all
nsaids.
translation of data generated in vitro culture systems is
difficult because the interactions of anti-neoplastic drugs
with cancer cells in vivo are much more complex that those
suggested by experimental studies. moreover, the in vitro
control of crc cell activity is usually obtained with
concentrations of drugs that could appear not realistic for
in vivo studies. in the specific case of  xxxd2579xxx , we would
however like to point out that, in line with data generated in
vitro systems, administration of  xxxd2579xxx  to patients with

sporadic colonic polyps or crc reduces the proliferation and
increases the apoptotic rate in the tumor samples [43,44]. it is
also noteworthy that the anti-mitogenic effect of  xxxd2579xxx 
documented in the present and other in vitro studies was
obtained with a concentration of drug which is in a range
similar to that reached within the gut tissue under standard
oral treatment [45].
the demonstration that  xxxd2579xxx  reduces the growth of both
cox-2-positive and -negative crc cells would imply that
chemoprevention of crc by  xxxd2579xxx  is not strictly influenced by
the expression of cox-2 within the tumour tissue. at the same
time however, the fact that  xxxd2579xxx  enhances the rate of
apoptosis only in cells that express cox-2 suggests that cox2-positive crc cells are more susceptible than cox-2-negative
cells to the anti-neoplastic effect of  xxxd2579xxx . further studies will
be necessary to confirm these results, and establish whether
data presented herein and generated using crc cell lines can
be extrapolated to ibd-related crc.
