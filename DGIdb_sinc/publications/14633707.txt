abstract
oncogenic forms of the small gtpase ras increase the resistance of
cells to killing by ionizing radiation (ir). although not all of the signaling
pathways for radioresistance are well defined, it is now clear that rasdependent signaling pathways involved in radioresistance include those
mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3ⴕ-kinase ( xxxg1743xxx -k) and raf. nevertheless,
 xxxg1743xxx -k and raf together are not sufficient to reconstitute all of the resistance conferred by ras, indicating that other effectors must also contribute. we show here that ras-driven autocrine signaling through the  xxxg682xxx  (egfr) also contributes to radioresistance
in ras-transformed cells. conditioned media (cm) collected from rie-1
rat intestinal epithelial cells expressing oncogenic ras increased the survival of irradiated cells. ras-cm contains elevated levels of the egfr
ligand transforming growth factor ␣ (tgf-␣). both ras-cm and tgf-␣
stimulated egfr phosphorylation, and exogenous tgf-␣ mimicked the
effects of ras-cm to increase radioresistance. blocking egfr signaling
with the egfr/ xxxg721xxx  kinase inhibitor (ki)  xxxd2445xxx  decreased the
postradiation survival of irradiated ras-transformed cells and normal
cells but had no effect on the survival of unirradiated cells. ras-cm and
tgf-␣ also increase  xxxg1743xxx -k activity downstream of the egfr and increase postradiation survival, both of which are abrogated by  xxxd2445xxx .
thus, ras utilizes autocrine signaling through egfr to increase radioresistance, and the egfr ki  xxxd2445xxx  acts as a radiosensitizer. the
observation that ras-transformed cells can be sensitized to killing by
ionizing radiation with  xxxd2445xxx  demonstrates that egfr kis could
potentially be used to radiosensitize tumors in which radioresistance is
dependent on ras-driven autocrine signaling through egfr.

introduction
activating ras mutations are found in 30% of all cancers, and
activation of signaling molecules both upstream and downstream of
ras is implicated in up to 90% (1). cell lines transformed by ras
display many of the properties of cancer cells including increased
growth rate, altered adhesion, and increased invasiveness and motility
(2, 3). although increased resistance to killing by ir4 is not always
associated with transformation, ras activation both in cell lines derived from normal tissues and in cell lines derived from tumors leads
to enhanced radioresistance (4 –10). conversely, blocking ras activity
has been shown to increase radiosensitivity (9, 11–14). because a
third of all cancers are currently treated with radiotherapy, and because the sensitivity of cells to killing by ir is an important determinant of the probability of cure (15, 16), finding out how ras can cause

this radioresistant phenotype and developing ways to stop ras-induced radioresistance would benefit many patients. we have set out to
determine how ras signaling enhances radioresistance.
key components of signaling in normal epithelial cells include the
ras controlled signaling cascades and autocrine signaling, which
involves the release and reception of growth factors. when growth
factors engage receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks), the rtks become
active through dimerization and phosphorylation of tyrosine residues
on their cytosolic regions. active rtks then recruit and activate
downstream signaling molecules, such as guanine nucleotide exchange factors for ras. guanine nucleotide exchange factors catalyze
the exchange of gdp for gtp such that wt ras becomes transiently
gtp-bound and active. egfr is one prominent rtk that transiently
activates ras, allowing ras to signal through an array of downstream
signaling pathways. activated ras up-regulates the  xxxg1743xxx -k ⬎ akt
signaling pathway and the raf ⬎ mek ⬎ erk signaling pathway in
many cell types. ras also signals through stress response signaling
pathways involving p38 and c-jun-nh2-terminal kinase mitogenactivated protein kinases, as well as through less well-defined pathways including the ral gtp exchange factor ralgds and the rab
exchange factor rin1 (17–21). egfr itself can also activate  xxxg1743xxx -k
and other signaling pathways independently of ras (22). the activity
of different subsets of these and other downstream pathways may lead
to different phenotypic changes. thus, one subset of signaling pathways may lead to increased growth rate, whereas another subset of
signaling pathways may enhance resistance to ir. these ultimate
phenotypic changes due to ras signaling are dependent not only on
signaling directly downstream of ras but also on altered autocrine
(cell-cell) signaling. whereas ras activity has been known to influence autocrine signaling for some time, it is still unclear which subsets
of ras signaling pathways are responsible.
oncogenic ras differs from wt ras in that it is constitutively
gtp-bound and thus is constitutively activated independently of rtk
signaling. oncogenic ras utilizes autocrine signaling to mediate many
of its oncogenic properties. ras transformation of the epithelial cell
lines rie-1, iec-6, and mcf-10a depends on ras amplification of
autocrine signaling (23), whereas ras transformation of fibroblasts is
less dependent on autocrine signaling. increased expression of tgf-␣
has been associated with ras transformation in various systems (24,
25), and other egfr ligands including  xxxg185xxx , hb-egf, and
␤-cellulin may play a role as well (26). activated ras can thus
amplify dysregulated autocrine signaling through egfr to increase
signaling to  xxxg1743xxx -k and other egfr effectors to mediate transformation. thus, activated ras may be responsible for the overstimulation
of egfr associated with some tumors. for example, tgf-␣ is
overexpressed in the majority of breast, colorectal, and head and neck
tumors, but the role of ras activity in these situations is unknown (25,
27, 28). other egfr ligands are also found at higher levels in tumors
than in normal tissues (28, 29). in addition, higher levels of egfr
ligands including tgf-␣,  xxxg727xxx , and hb-egf correlate with
worse prognosis in bladder cancer and in head and neck squamous
carcinoma (30 –33). overexpression of egfr itself has been seen in
many types of cancer, including breast, glioma, ovarian, and head and
neck carcinoma, and correlates with aggressive tumor growth and

autocrine-mediated radioresistance

poor prognosis in most (31, 34 –38). stimulation of egfr by tgf-␣
overexpression has also been associated with poor prognosis (31, 37,
39, 40). this worse prognosis may be correlated with the enhanced
radioresistance associated with stimulation of egfr by autocrine
signaling. for example, stimulation of egfr activity by ligands has
been associated with enhanced radioresistance in mammary carcinoma cells (41, 42). blocking egfr with monoclonal anti-egfr
antibodies, dominant-negative egfr, or an egfr ki has been shown
to radiosensitize cancer cell lines (43– 45). the anti-egfr antibody
 xxxd467xxx  has shown promise in enhancing radiotherapy in humans, as
described in several recent reviews (46 – 48). these methods predominantly block egfr itself. other egfr family members, such as
 xxxg721xxx , a heterodimerization partner of egfr and other egfr family
members, also play a role in radioresistance (48, 49). a ki that can
block the activity of both  xxxg721xxx  and egfr, such as  xxxd2445xxx ,
formerly known as  xxxd2445xxx  (50), would be advantageous in
decreasing radioresistance of tumor cells with up-regulated  xxxg721xxx 
activity as well.
while studying how ras can induce radioresistance in our rat
intestinal epithelial (rie-1) model system, we showed that both  xxxg1743xxx -k
and raf signaling play a role in radioresistance (51). however, rie-1
cells transformed simultaneously with both  xxxg1743xxx -k and raf failed to
recapitulate the level of radioresistance observed in ras-transformed
cells.5 thus, we have sought to identify additional ways that ras may
increase radioresistance. ras proteins mediate many of their actions
through recruitment of  xxxg1924xxx  to the cell surface, but activated raf is
insufficient to induce transformation of rie-1 cells (23). ras-expressing, but not raf-expressing, rie-1 cells transcribe higher levels of
autocrine factors including insulin,  xxxg1044xxx , and the
egfr ligands, tgf-␣, hb-egf, and  xxxg185xxx  (52). this rasinduced increase in egfr ligands is required for ras-mediated transformation of rie-1 cells (23, 53). blocking ras activity in rie-1 cells
leads to a reduction in tgf-␣ and  xxxg185xxx  expression (53).
thus, ras-transformed cells up-regulate signaling through the egfr,
and because higher levels of egfr activity have been associated with
radioresistance, we hypothesized that ras-transformed cells may increase egfr activity to cause part of the radioresistant phenotype
seen in many ras-transformed cells.
to determine whether ras mediates radioresistance through autocrine signaling, we collected culture medium conditioned by both
normal and ras-transformed rie-1 cells and treated normal rie-1
cells with this medium prior to ir. we observed that ras-cm enhanced radioresistance and stimulated phosphorylation of the egfr.
pretreatment of cells with tgf-␣, which we have shown previously to
be present at higher levels in cm from ras-transformed rie-1 cells as
compared with normal rie-1 cells, also enhanced radioresistance and
stimulated phosphorylation of egfr. inhibition of egfr led to
radiosensitization of both normal and ras-transformed rie-1 cells
and also of cells stimulated with ras-cm or tgf-␣. we also examined signaling downstream of egfr in cells treated with the egfr
ki and observed decreased  xxxg1743xxx -k and raf activity. we thus conclude
that ras mediates radioresistance in part by alteration of autocrine
signaling and that that signaling involves stimulation of the egfr.

cells. rie-1 rat intestinal epithelial cells [gift of robert j. coffey; vanderbilt university, nashville, tn (58)] were maintained in monolayer culture in
dmem-h (life technologies, inc., gaithersburg, md), supplemented with
5% fbs, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin at 37°c in a
humidified atmosphere of 90% air and 10% co2. cells were transfected with
the pbabe plasmids using fugene 6 (roche applied science) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions or infected with ecotropic retrovirus obtained
by using pvpack packaging vectors in 293t cells (stratagene, la jolla, ca).
stable cell lines were established by selection in 2 ␮g/ml  xxxd3041xxx  (life
technologies, inc.).
collection of cm. rie-ras, rie-raf, or rie-vector cells were allowed to
grow until confluent. the culture medium was then removed, cells were
washed two times in pbs, and fresh medium was added. after 2 days, the cm
was collected from the confluent dishes and filtered through a 0.2 ␮m filter.
colony forming assays. rie-1 cells stably expressing ras or empty
vector were plated at low density. cells were treated with cm or tgf-␣
[peninsula laboratories (vehicle control was double-distilled water; concentration of tgf-␣ used is indicated in the figures)] 30 min before ir. for cells
treated with the egfr/ xxxg721xxx  ki,  xxxd2445xxx  (or the dmso vehicle control)
was added to the culture medium 60 min before ir and replaced if the medium
was replaced 30 min before ir. cells were irradiated with a single dose of 7
gy from a co60 theratron irradiator (atomic energy of canada, ltd.) at a dose
rate of 85 cgy/min or from a cs137 irradiator (jl shepherd) at a dose rate of
158 cgy/min. in all conditions, the culture medium was changed 10 min after
ir. after 2 weeks of incubation, samples were fixed in methanol:acetic acid
(3:1, v/v) and stained in 1% crystal violet, and the number of viable colonies
(defined as those colonies containing ⱖ50 cells) per dish was counted. surviving fraction was calculated from the number of colonies formed in the
irradiated dishes compared with the number formed in the unirradiated control,
where plating efficiency is defined as the percentage of cells plated that form
colonies in unirradiated dishes, and surviving fraction ⫽ number of colonies
formed/(number of cells plated ⫻ plating efficiency). each bar on the survival
graph represents the mean surviving fraction from at least two dishes. for cells
treated with  xxxd2445xxx , the number of colonies formed in inhibitor-treated
dishes was compared with the number of colonies formed in the vehicle
(dmso)-treated dishes.
immunoprecipitation and egfr immunoblot. cells were plated at
7.5 ⫻ 105 cells/dish and allowed to attach overnight. cells were then starved
in 0.5% fbs for 24 h. thirty min before lysis, cells were either fed with fresh
medium, placed in cm or treated with tgf-␣. for cells treated with the ki,
 xxxd2445xxx  (or the dmso vehicle control) was added to the culture medium
45 min before lysis and replaced if the culture medium was changed for cm
treatment. cells were lysed in normal lysis buffer [20 mm tris (ph 7.5), 1%
triton x-100, 500 mm nacl, 5 mm edta, 50 mm naf, 1 mm na3vo4, 10%
glycerol, 10 ␮g/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 ␮g/ml leupeptin, 4
␮g/ml aprotinin]. lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 ⫻ g for 10 min at 4°c to
remove nuclei and insoluble material. protein concentration in the lysates was
determined using a bio-rad protein assay kit (bio-rad laboratories, hercules,
ca). egfr was immunoprecipitated from 800 ␮g of protein with 5 ␮l of
ab22 [polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against recombinant glutathione stransferase fusion protein containing the cooh-terminal 100 amino acids of
egfr (59)] after overnight incubation with 25 ␮l of protein a-agarose beads
(santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca) at 4°c. immune complexes were
washed two times in normal lysis buffer and then denatured in sds sample
buffer. protein samples were separated on 8% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. membranes were
blocked for 1 h in 3% cold fish gelatin in tris-buffered saline and 0.1% tween
20. to determine the phosphorylation status of receptors, membranes were
probed with 1:2,500 anti- xxxd1075xxx  conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (rc20h; bd transduction laboratories, lexington, ky) overnight at
4°c. after washing, detection was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence
(rpn2106; amersham). to determine total receptor levels after precipitation,
membranes were stripped, blocked in 3% cold fish gelatin/tbst, incubated
with a 1:1,000 dilution of ab22 overnight at 4°c, washed, and incubated with
a 1:10,000 dilution of antirabbit igg (santa cruz biotechnology). detection
was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence.

autocrine-mediated radioresistance

30 min before lysis, cells were either fed fresh medium, placed in cm or
treated with 20 ng/ml tgf-␣ and/or  xxxd2445xxx , or the vehicle was replaced
if the culture medium was changed for cm treatment. cells were lysed in
triton x-100 lysis buffer [50 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.5), 100 mm nacl, 1% (v/v)

described for immunoprecipitation. twenty ␮g of protein for each sample were
separated by sds-page on 10% sds, 15% acrylamide low cross-linker gels
(60). separated proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes and blocked in tbst containing 5% nonfat powdered milk.

and anti-erk (sc-94; santa cruz biotechnology). for all primary antibodies,
the secondary antibody used was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit

results
tgf-␣ and tgf-␣-containing cm from ras-transformed
cells (ras-cm) increase postradiation survival of normal rie-1
cells. ras transformation of rie-1 cells leads to increased radioresistance, and rie-ras cells are characterized by increased production of autocrine growth factors, including the egfr ligands tgf-␣,
 xxxg185xxx  (ar), and hb-egf. thus, we asked whether autocrine
growth factor production induced by ras transformation contributes
to ras-mediated radioresistance. cells producing autocrine growth
factors release those growth factors to “condition” the cell growth
medium (cm). we have shown previously in rie-1 cells that application to normal cells of cm from ras-transformed cells (ras-cm),
but not of cm from normal cells (vector-cm), leads to a transformed
phenotype (61). we collected ras-cm that induces a transformed
morphology in normal rie-1 cells, whereas vector-cm does not alter
cell morphology (data not shown). we then applied the cm to
sparsely plated normal rie-1 cells 30 min before irradiation. we
observed that ras-cm enhances survival of normal rie-1 cells
(fig. 1a), indicating that ras transformation can lead to secretion of
autocrine factors that enhance radioresistance. because previous work
showed that ras transformation of rie-1 cells leads to increased
production of several autocrine factors that are ligands for egfr
family members and that tgf-␣ was the most elevated over normal
cells, we decided to test whether tgf-␣ could alter the radiation
response of rie-1 cells. when 10 ng/ml tgf-␣ was applied to normal
rie-1 cells, we observed a 1.6-fold enhancement of survival
(fig. 1b). we observed similar responses with a concentration as low
as 1 ng/ml, but the effect of tgf-␣ falls off at the highest dose
(50 ng/ml). we also tested whether tgf-␣ could alter the survival of
rie-ras or rie-raf cells and observed that tgf-␣ enhances the
radioresistance of these cells as well, suggesting that the effect of
autocrine activity on radiation response is not already maximized
(fig. 1c) under these conditions. the autocrine component of rasmediated radioresistance may not be as readily measured by these
clonogenic survival experiments in which cells are plated sparsely, but
it is likely to have a greater effect in vivo, where many cells are in
close proximity. in vivo, the elaborated autocrine factors are concentrated and are not diluted into a large volume of culture medium. in
addition, surface-bound autocrine ligands can be presented efficiently
to neighboring cells only under conditions of high cell density. our
data indicate that ras-cm contains autocrine factors that enhance
radioresistance of rie-1 cells even under conditions of low cell

fig. 1. both ras-cm and tgf-␣ increase resistance to ir in rie-1 cells. cells were
plated, irradiated, and assayed for colony formation as described in “materials and
methods.” clonogenic survival was assessed in the presence of fresh medium, cm, or
tgf-␣. cells were either mock-irradiated or irradiated with a dose of 7 gy. after 2 weeks,
cells were fixed and stained, and the number of colonies was counted. mock-irradiated
cells survived similarly under all conditions. a, cells were treated with fresh medium,
vector-cm, ras-cm, or raf-cm 30 min before ir. b, cells were treated with the indicated
concentration of tgf-␣ 30 min before ir. c, stable cell lines were treated with 20 ng/ml
tgf-␣ 30 min before ir. assays were repeated three times. data shown represent the
average survival of duplicate dishes from a representative assay, and the error bars
represent the sd of the counts from the duplicate dishes.

density and that one known component of this cm, tgf-␣, enhances
radioresistance of both normal and transformed cells.
tgf-␣-containing ras-cm increases phosphorylation of
egfr. because activation of egfr has been linked to radioresistance in multiple studies, and ras-cm contains egfr ligands, we

autocrine-mediated radioresistance

reasoned that the mechanism by which ras-cm enhances radioresistance was through activation of egfr family members. the tyrosine
residues of egfr become phosphorylated when egfr engages ligand, dimerizes, and transphosphorylates its dimerization partner.
tyrosine phosphorylation status of egfr is routinely used as an
indication of egfr kinase activity. to determine whether there was
egf-like activity in the ras-cm, we treated normal rie-1 cells with
fresh medium, cm, or tgf-␣ 30 min before lysis; performed egfr
immunoprecipitation; and then blotted for  xxxd1075xxx . as shown
in fig. 2, we detected an increase above the basal tyrosine phosphorylation in normal rie-1 cells treated with either ras-cm or tgf-␣
and to a much lesser extent in those treated with raf-cm. vector-cm
stimulates phosphorylation of egfr less well than fresh media because fresh media contains fresh serum and the growth factors contained in that serum, whereas the serum present in vector-cm is
depleted of some growth factors by the cells that conditioned the
media. the observation that ras-cm and tgf-␣ similarly enhance
egfr phosphorylation supports our hypothesis that ras-cm stimulates egfr to enhance radioresistance.
the egfr ki blocks phosphorylation of egfr and decreases
survival of rie-1 cells. to confirm that autocrine activation of the
egfr was responsible for the ras-induced radioresistance, we evaluated the effect of an egfr tyrosine ki.  xxxd2445xxx  blocks the kinase
activity of egfr and  xxxg721xxx  and thus should block tgf-␣ and other
ligands from stimulating signaling cascades dependent on egfr (62).
thus, we treated rie-1 cells with the egfr ki and then added cm
or tgf-␣. we observed that the ki completely blocked phosphorylation of egfr both in cells treated with cm and in cells treated with
tgf-␣ (fig. 3a). we also observed that as little as 1 ␮g/ml of the
egfr ki resulted in complete inhibition of egfr tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). thus, the egfr ki blocks egfr function.
when we similarly treated sparsely plated rie-1 cells with either cm
or tgf-␣ in the presence of the ki and then irradiated the cells, we
observed that the ki blocked both the enhanced radioresistance seen
with cm and the enhanced radioresistance seen with tgf-␣ (fig. 3b).
thus, ras transformation can lead to both signaling downstream of
ras to enhance radioresistance and secretion of egfr ligands that
enhance radioresistance. the egfr ki additionally lowered the basal
radioresistance seen in cells treated with vector-cm (fig. 3b). rieras, rie-raf, and rie-vector cells were radiosensitized by the egfr
ki (fig. 3c), demonstrating that egfr and  xxxg721xxx  are generally
important for radioresistance and that ras-transformed cells can be
radiosensitized by egfr inhibition.

fig. 3. the egfr ki  xxxd2445xxx  blocks phosphorylation of egfr and decreases
survival. cells were treated with egfr ki or vehicle (dmso) before treatment with cm
or tgf-␣. a, immunoprecipitation for phosphorylated (activated) egfr, carried out as
described in the fig. 2 legend, with 45 min of incubation in the presence of inhibitor. b,

carried out as described in the fig. 1 legend. c, clonogenic survival of cells treated with
the egfr ki or vehicle. immunoprecipitation data are representative of two independent
experiments, and survival data are representative of three independent experiments.

fig. 2. both ras-cm and tgf-␣ increase phosphorylation of egfr. to determine
phosphorylation status in response to various stimuli, normal cells were lysed 30 min after
stimulation, 800 ␮g of protein were immunoprecipitated with an anti-egfr antibody, and
immunoblot analysis was carried out using an antibody against phospho-tyrosine. total
egfr levels were detected by stripping the blots and reprobing with an antibody against
total egfr. data shown are representative of three independent experiments.

both ras-cm and tgf-␣ stimulate  xxxg1743xxx -k activity that is
blocked by the egfr ki. ligand-bound egfr activates multiple
signaling pathways including ras. in turn, ras signaling branches
through multiple signaling cascades involving  xxxg1743xxx -k ⬎ akt,
raf ⬎ mek ⬎ erk, and raf ⬎ novel unknown effectors and other
ras-dependent signaling cascades. in addition, egfr can activate

autocrine-mediated radioresistance

 xxxg1743xxx -k independently of ras, as well as activate other signaling cascades, such as signal transducers and activators of transcription
(stats). activation of either ras or  xxxg1743xxx -k has been shown to result
in enhanced radioresistance of rie-1 cells (51) and of other cell types
as well (63). we hypothesized that ras-cm may stimulate egfr,
which would activate ras or  xxxg1743xxx -k signaling cascades to enhance
radioresistance. therefore, we examined whether cm or tgf-␣
would result in activation of  xxxg1743xxx -k signaling by using akt phosphorylation status as a readout for  xxxg1743xxx -k activity. we observed that
treatment of cells with fresh medium, ras-cm, raf-cm, or tgf-␣
resulted in increased p-akt levels, whereas untreated, starved cells did
not display phosphorylated akt (fig. 4a). fresh medium can stimulate
phosphorylation of akt due to the growth factors in serum. cm is
collected from confluent cells, so the media are depleted of growth
factors and nutrients. thus, both vector-cm and raf-cm result in less
phosphorylation of akt than fresh media because cm has been
depleted of growth factors and because rie-raf and rie-vector cells
elaborate only low levels of egfr ligands. treatment with the egfr
ki blocks the akt phosphorylation seen in all conditions, indicating
that egfr ligands are responsible for all of the detected  xxxg1743xxx -k
activity seen in the presence of cm. as with p-akt, we also observed
that fresh medium, ras-cm, and tgf-␣ lead to increased levels of
p-erk, whereas raf-cm and vector-cm fail to stimulate erk phosphorylation (fig. 4b). again, this signaling can be blocked with the
egfr ki, indicating that raf activity is dependent on egfr stimulation by ligands in the cm. thus, ras-transformed cells can produce
growth factors that stimulate egfr and lead to raf and  xxxg1743xxx -k
signaling, and this signaling may be a major player in the rasmediated radioresistance associated with autocrine signaling.
discussion
oncogenic ras induces radioresistance in part by activating
egfr through up-regulation of autocrine signaling. previously, we and others have shown that ras transformation increases

raf effector mek. however, experiments with stable cell lines expressing active forms of either  xxxg1743xxx -k or raf or both  xxxg1743xxx -k and raf
show that a combination of these pathways is insufficient for the full
radioresistance seen with active ras. thus, ras uses additional
signaling pathways for complete radioresistance. in a search for
additional signaling pathways that ras may use to increase radioresistance, we examined ras-dependent autocrine signaling. rastransformed rie-1 epithelial cells have been shown to up-regulate the
production of egfr ligands, particularly tgf-␣ (23, 52, 53). ras has
also been demonstrated to increase levels of tgf-␣ in other cell types
(24, 25). we have now shown here that ras-transformed cells use
autocrine signaling through the egfr to make rie-1 epithelial cells
resistant to radiation. we have shown here that the egfr ligand,
tgf-␣, which we and others have previously demonstrated is upregulated in rie-1 cells by h-ras activity (23, 52, 53), is itself able to
enhance radioresistance, suggesting that this is the component in
ras-cm that is responsible. many tumors, some of which have
activated ras, have been demonstrated to elaborate higher levels of
tgf-␣ (65, 66). the increased production of this and other egf-like
ligands may be partially responsible for the increased radioresistance
seen in many tumors (25, 27, 28, 32). others have shown that egfr
overexpression is positively correlated with radioresistance in murine
carcinomas (67, 68) and that stimulation of egfr by epidermal
growth factor is associated with radioresistance in a431 and mcf-7
cells (41, 42). now we have shown that ras-induced autocrine factors
can activate egfr to enhance radioresistance. this is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, that oncogenic ras can increase radioresistance through an autocrine signaling pathway.
abrogation of egfr signaling by  xxxd2445xxx  causes radiosensitization. like ras, egfr has long been considered to play an
important role in radiation response of epithelial tumors. clinically,
overexpression of egfr in tumors correlates with poorer response to
radiotherapy (69), and increasing levels of egfr correlate with
radioresistance in head and neck cancer cell lines (70). indeed, the
egfr is an attractive target for radiosensitization. preclinical studies
have shown effective radiosensitization using either anti-egfr
monoclonal antibodies ( xxxd467xxx ) or small molecule tyrosine kis
( xxxd2186xxx /iressa,  xxxd421xxx , and  xxxd2445xxx ) in both in vitro and in vivo
models (45, 71–75). based on preclinical efficacy, several phase i/ii
trials testing the toxicity and efficacy of combining egfr inhibitors
with radiotherapy are under way or completed, and the results of a
completed phase iii randomized trial in head and neck cancer are
pending (reviewed in ref. 48). however, considerable doubt remains
as to the most appropriate selection of patients for enrollment on these
trials because the mechanism of radiosensitization is not yet clearly
defined. the egfr inhibitors have pleiotropic tumor effects when
used alone or combined with radiotherapy, including pronounced
antiangiogenic effects [accompanied by decrease in egfr-mediated
 xxxg2413xxx  expression, perturbation of dna
repair, cell cycle alterations, and enhancement of radiation-induced
apoptosis (47, 76)]. we have now shown that egfr inhibitors exert
yet another effect on radiation response by inhibiting a resistanceinducing ras-mediated autocrine loop. whereas the effect of egfr
ki  xxxd2445xxx  is more pronounced in egfr-driven cell lines than in
our rie-1 cells (73), amplification of modest radiosensitizing effects
with fractionated regimens in the clinical setting may result in meaningful differences in tumor control. thus, should patients be selected
for trials based on the level of egfr expression or activation (as an
indicator that the tumor pathogenesis involves egfr), the level of
 xxxg2413xxx  expression, ras mutation, or other

autocrine-mediated radioresistance

as yet unknown factors? the answer will only be achieved by carefully designed correlative clinical trials, but our data suggest that
tumors harboring ras mutations may respond to  xxxd1256xxx 
therapy.
ras-transformed cells are able to activate  xxxg1743xxx -k and other signaling
cascades independently of autocrine signaling, and these pathways
have previously been demonstrated to be necessary and partially
sufficient for ras-mediated radioresistance. the observation that the
egfr ki can nevertheless radiosensitize ras-transformed cells demonstrates that signaling pathways directly downstream of ras are
insufficient to overcome egfr inhibition under these conditions.
thus, multiple pathways downstream of ras, including autocrine
signaling through egfr, must synergize for the complete effect of
ras transformation on radioresistance in this model. in addition,
egfr itself is activated by ir (77, 78), and thus, the egfr ki blocks
radiation-induced egfr activation and the component of radioresistance induced by that activation. finally, radiation-induced release of
tgf-␣ has also been shown to enhance radioresistance in mammary
carcinoma cells (79). in addition, this egfr ki has been shown to
decrease some of the transformed properties of ras-driven tumors
such as increased growth rate (62).
we have demonstrated here that  xxxd2445xxx  can also radiosensitize
normal cells that have been made radioresistant by oncogene-driven
paracrine signaling. the observation that this egfr ki so specifically
blocks the enhanced radioresistance seen with ras-cm and tgf-␣
further demonstrates that the autocrine component of ras-mediated
radioresistance depends in part on activation of and signaling through
egfr and that ras induces the elaboration of growth factors that
specifically engage egfr to activate signaling cascades that enhance
survival. our data suggest that egfr ki may be effective as radiosensitizers not only in tumors with egfr overexpression but also in
tumors with activated ras because ras activity increases production
of egfr ligands. an interesting potential explanation for the greater
efficacy demonstrated by egfr kis in vivo than in vitro, in addition
to their effect on inhibition of angiogenesis, may be that autocrine
survival factors, such as tgf-␣, are more concentrated and effectively presented in tissue models than in a sparsely plated tissue
culture experiment.
the observation that raf-cm could moderately enhance radioresistance is in agreement with previous data showing that an active
form of raf leads to radioresistance and that an antisense form of raf
can cause radiosensitization (51, 80). raf-cm contains only low
levels of tgf-␣,  xxxg185xxx , and hb-egf mrnas (52), but it
mildly increased egfr phosphorylation. we observed that the egfr
ki blocks the radioresistance seen with raf-cm. thus, we conclude
that raf-cm mediates moderate radioresistance via an egfr autocrine loop through other egfr family ligands, such as  xxxg721xxx , which
is also inhibited by  xxxd2445xxx  (50, 62, 73). it would be interesting to
identify this ligand. nonetheless, the effect of the raf-elaborated
ligands is substantially less than that of the cm-elaborated by rastransformed cells, and ras obviously utilizes additional raf-independent autocrine signaling to enhance radioresistance.
cross-talk between a tgf-␣ autocrine loop and direct
activation of  xxxg1743xxx -k by ras. how does autocrine signaling through
the egfr enhance radioresistance?  xxxg1743xxx -k is an obvious candidate
as a downstream mediator of egfr-induced radioresistance because  xxxg1743xxx -k is both necessary for ras-mediated radioresistance
and important for cell survival after ir in general (51, 63, 81).
multiple studies have examined akt phosphorylation status as a
readout for  xxxg1743xxx -k activity in tumors with egfr overexpression,
and loss of akt phosphorylation has been used as a measure of

the effectiveness of egfr inhibition (62, 69, 82). akt itself is a
mediator of radioresistance.6
we have shown here that both ras-cm and tgf-␣ lead to increased levels of both p-akt and p-erk. thus, activated ras can
stimulate  xxxg1743xxx -k and erk activity both directly and through autocrine
signaling to egfr. we have also shown that  xxxd2445xxx  blocks the
ability of cm and tgf-␣ to stimulate signaling through  xxxg1743xxx -k and to
erk. the fact that we could block phosphorylation of akt and erk
with the egfr ki shows that p-akt and p-erk levels are increased
by signaling through egfr and not through other receptors that are
stimulated by non-egfr family ligands in ras-cm. it is presently
unclear whether the egfr signaling to activate  xxxg1743xxx -k goes through
ras or is independent of ras.
the autocrine loop in ras-transformed cells might increase radioresistance by further up-regulating either the signaling of endogenous
wt ras, egfr-dependent but ras-independent signaling downstream of  xxxg1743xxx -k, or additional egfr-dependent pathways such as the
stat pathway. autocrine signaling from ras may also lead to
activity of egfr-independent signaling pathways that mediate radioresistance. in summary, activated ras leads to egfr activity,
which, in turn, activates ras pathways in a positive feedback mechanism for radioresistance. overexpression of egfr family members
could also lead to this positive feedback mechanism for radioresistance. all of these positive feedback pathways work together to
mediate radioresistance in tumors, and blocking autocrine signaling
with egfr kis such as  xxxd2445xxx  may enhance the effectiveness of
radiotherapy.
