the genetics and biology of disc1—an emerging role
in psychosis and cognition
david j. porteous, pippa thomson, nicholas j. brandon, and j. kirsty millar
in the developing field of biological psychiatry, disc1 stands out by virtue of there being credible evidence, both genetic and biological,
for a role in determining susceptibility to schizophrenia and related disorders. we highlight the methodologic paradigm that led to
identification of disc1 and review the supporting genetic and biological evidence. the original finding of disc1 as a gene disrupted
by a balanced translocation on chromosome 1q42 that segregates with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and recurrent major
depression has sparked a number of confirmatory linkage and association studies. these indicate that disc1 is a generalizable genetic
risk factor for psychiatric illness that also influences cognition in healthy subjects. disc1 has also been shown to interact with a
number of proteins with neurobiological pedigrees, including ndel1 (nudel), a key regulator of neuronal migration with
endo-oligopeptidase activity, and  xxxg1698xxx , a phosphodiesterase that is critical for cyclic  xxxd81xxx  signaling and that
is directly linked to learning, memory, and mood. both are potential “drug” targets. disc1 has thus emerged as a key molecular player
in the etiology of major mental illness and in normal brain processes.

psychiatric illness cosegregating with a balanced
chromosomal translocation

bundant evidence from family, twin, and adoption studies
suggests a substantial genetic contribution to the risk of
developing schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, and
related major mental illnesses, but the road to gene discovery has
been rocky with several false trails. it is not the purpose of this
review to consider critically alternative strategies for charting a
successful course to gene discovery but rather to highlight one
successful strategy that we employed to identify the disc1 gene.
suffice to say that classical linkage studies have the power and
resolution to identify loci but rarely genes, whereas candidate
gene association studies and, more so, prospective whole genome association studies are problematic, not least because of
multiple testing, the presence of variable extents of linkage
disequilibrium, and the absence of biologically confirmed causal
variants. molecular cytogenetics is a powerful alternative genomewide strategy to nominate candidate genes. this is how the
disc1 gene (millar et al 2000) and others (macintyre et al 2003)
were identified. the one fundamental presupposition is that in
the proband the cytogenetic event is necessary and sufficient to
predispose to the observed psychiatric phenotypes.

the molecular cytogenetics strategy
in the molecular cytogenetics strategy, chromosome spreads
(metaphase or interphase) are examined for evidence of cytogenetic anomalies, and promising finds are followed up using
chromosome paints and thereafter probes of higher resolution
(typically bac clones) to define the rearrangement at the molecular level (pickard et al 2005b). it is important to note, however,
that no assertion is made here that cytogenetic rearrangements
(chromosome translocations, inversion, deletions, and duplications) account for a substantial proportion of the trait variance or
disease liability. rather, this is a powerful discovery strategy for
possibly unique or rare events that offers the possibility of a

the discovery of disc1 has its roots in prescient studies of
chromosomal abnormalities undertaken by the mrc population
and cytogenetics (now human genetics) unit in edinburgh, uk
(jacobs et al 1970). st. clair et al (1990) searched the cytogenetics
database for any cases with an associated psychiatric diagnosis,
followed up this case and family members, conducted a psychiatric and cytogenetic examination, and reported that the balanced translocation between chromosomes 1 and 11 originally
identified in the proband (a young person with adolescent
conduct disorder) was inherited and present in about half of the
family members. strikingly, the family had a high loading of
major mental illness that cosegregated with the t(1;11) translocation with high statistical significance. the log of the odds
(lod) score was 3.4 when the diagnosis was restricted to
schizophrenia alone. this equates with a probability of less than
one in a thousand of observing this cosegregation pattern by
chance. thirty years after the proband was first identified,
blackwood et al (2001) demonstrated the enormous value of
long-term clinical follow-up and the evolving nature of psychiatric illness. of 29 individuals on whom cytogenetic analysis had
confirmed the presence of the translocation, 7 had a diagnosis of
schizophrenia, 1 bipolar affective disorder, and 10 recurrent
major depression (or mmd). thus, 18 of 29 (70%) translocation
carriers had a diagnosis of major mental illness, whereas none of
38 nontranslocation carriers had such a diagnosis— compelling
statistical evidence for a causal link between the t(1;11) and the
psychiatric liability in this unique family (lod ⫽ 7.1, or less than
a 1 in 10 million probability of chance occurrence). moreover,
blackwood et al (2001) also reported that in unaffected translocation carriers the latency and amplitude of the event related
potential (erp) p300 was indistinguishable from those of
affected individuals and that as a group the translocation carriers
showed the characteristic abnormal erp p300 associated with
scz and with bp.
to summarize, the pattern of inheritance in the t(1;11) family
is consistent with a simple dominant mode of inheritance with
reduced penetrance, with altered erp p300 as a correlated
endophenotype. epidemiological, family, and twin studies all
point to a high heritability for schizophrenia and for bipolar

affective disorder, with mz concordances rates of .5–.8 (kendler
et al 1993; mcguffin et al 2003; sullivan et al 2003). thus, in this
family the t(1;11) accounts for essentially all of the expected
transmitted risk. secondary and independently segregating genetic risk factors, variable environmental exposures, or stochastic
events may influence the presence or absence of clinical signs
and the specific psychiatric diagnosis. one final point worth
emphasizing is that the t(1;11) apart, there were no other
distinguishing clinical features of the psychiatric presentations
(blackwood et al 2001).

positional cloning of the disc1 gene
a variety of hypothetical mechanisms (long-range position
effect on transcription, novel gene fusion product, etc) could be
invoked to explain the causal link between the t(1;11) and
psychiatric illness, but ocam’s razor suggested looking for
evidence of direct disruption of a gene at the translocation
breakpoints (millar et al 2000; muir et al 1995). there was no
evidence for gene disruption on chromosome 11 but clear
evidence for direct disruption of what became known as the
disrupted in schizophrenia (disc) locus (millar et al 2000). in
fact, the evidence was for not one but two genes disrupted. the
disc1 gene occupies approximately 415 kb of genomic dna,
comprises a 13-exon transcript of about 7.5 kb, and encodes a
novel protein of 854 amino acids (millar et al 2000). the genomic
structure and amino acid sequence is conserved across primates,
rodents, and fish, but there is no obvious insect or worm
homologue (taylor et al 2003). antiparallel and antisense to
disc1 is an apparently rna-only gene, disc2. the disc2
transcript is at least 15 kb long and therefore joins a small but
interesting class of rna-only genes that are thought to be
negative regulators of their protein-coding counterparts (taylor
et al 2003). there is as yet nothing more concrete to say about
any possible impact of disc2 on the psychiatric phenotype, but
much more can be said about disc1.

evidence for the disc locus as a risk factor
in psychiatric illness and related traits
independent evidence for the involvement of disc1 in psychiatric illness has come from studies of the finnish population.
ekelund et al (2000) reported a linkage peak (lod ⫽ 2.65) at
d1s2833, 1cm proximal to disc1, for 134 sib pairs affected with
schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, a result that was
further refined using a microsatellite within intron 9 of disc1,
generating a lod score of 3.21 for schizophrenia, plus schizoaffective disorder and schizophrenia spectrum (ekelund et al
2001). this linkage has since been replicated in an independent

finnish population sample (lod ⫽ 2.7 for a snp in intron 9;
ekelund et al 2004). other studies of taiwanese, north american,
icelandic, and british subjects have all shown suggestive linkage
between psychiatric illness and the 1q42 region using broad
phenotype models (table 1). recently, a genome scan of families
ascertained for schizoaffective disorder (rather than schizophrenia or bipolar disorder) generated a lod score of 3.54 for a
microsatellite in 1q42.2 (hamshere et al 2005). thus, as first
noted in the t(1;11) family, variants at the disc locus appear to
predispose to a wide spectrum of psychiatric disorders in the
general population.
association studies have also been supportive but must be
interpreted with some caution because there is likely to be a
publication bias toward positive findings. moreover, there is only
partial overlap between the markers used and the phenotypes
tested in these independent studies (figure 1). devon et al (2001)
sequenced the exons and intron– exon boundaries of disc1 and
reported 15 novel polymorphisms including the common
ser704cys polymorphism in exon 11. no evidence of single
marker association was observed, but this was a preliminary
study of low power designed primarily to discover and report
potentially useful polymorphisms. hennah et al (2003) reported
an association study on a sample of 458 finnish families with
probands ascertained for schizophrenia, but applying a broad
diagnosis of affected status to relatives (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizotypal disorder, bipolar disorder and recurrent major depression). they found a number of associated
haplotypes of which hep3, which spans 62kb from intron 1 to
exon 2, was the most statistically robust. hep3 shows undertransmission only to affected females (p ⫽ .00024) implying a
sex-specific effect of variants in disc1. in females, the undertransmitted haplotype was significantly associated with delusions, hallucinations, and negative-component-traits, but not
with manic or depressive symptoms. the exon 9 haplotype
(hep1) has been replicated in an independent sample from the
finnish population using the same snps (ekelund et al 2004). in
north american study samples, callicott et al (2005) reported
haplotype association with schizophrenia (p ⫽ .002), whereas
hodgkinson et al (2004) reported association to schizophrenia,
to schizoaffective disorder and to bipolar disorder as discrete
diagnoses (p ⫽ .05, p ⫽ .0000023, and p ⬍ .01, respectively). the
fourth major study was performed in the same population from
which the original translocation family was identified (thomson
et al 2005b). this study identified tagging snps monitoring
haplotypes within disc1 and tested case control samples of both
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. consistent with the linkage
results from this population (macgregor et al 2004), the strongest
association was seen with bipolar disorder (p ⫽ .0016), although

psychiatric illness in disc1 with the position of the
first and last single nucleotide poloymorphism
(snp) of each haplotype are shown. the chromosome band, reference genes, isoforms (taken from
the july 2003 ucsc human genome project

nonsynonymous coding snps and the translocation
breakpoint (chr1:228985373-228985374) are also
shown.

some evidence for association was also seen for schizophrenia
(p ⫽ .0056). sex-specific associations were seen, the most
significant being for bipolar affective disorder in females (p ⫽
.00026). female-specific association was seen in the scottish
population, but with a haplotype spanning from intron 9 to exon
13. neither callicott et al (2005) nor hogkinson et al (2005)
conditioned for sex, but when hamshere et al (2005) included
sex as a variable in their linkage analysis of schizoaffective
disorder, the lod score increased by 1.63 (p ⫽ .04). comparisons between the four positive association studies are difficult
because of differences in the markers used (figure 1), but
notably all four studies that included leu607phe from exon 9
report significant haplotype association and the three studies
which tested arg264gln in exon 2 also report significant associ-

ated haplotypes. formal meta-analysis is now justified, as are formal
replications across study sets.
cognitive abilities have been shown to be impaired in individuals with schizophrenia and, to a lesser extent, bipolar
disorder (altshuler et al 2004; cannon et al 2000; elvevag and
goldberg 2000; ferrier and thompson 2002; gold 2004). as the
biology of disc1 has unraveled, so has interest increased in the
potential effect of genetic variation in disc1 on cognitive
function, as first indicated by the demonstration of altered erp
p300 in unaffected t(1;11) carriers (blackwood et al 2001). a
growing number of studies have now shown evidence of linkage
or association between the disc1 locus and impaired cognitive
and working memory function in both people with schizophrenia
and healthy individuals, consistent with dysfunction in the

dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (table 2). these include linkage
studies in the finnish population for working memory function
(gasperoni et al 2003), visual working memory (hennah et al
2003), and verbal learning and memory (paunio et al 2004).
callicott et al (2005) showed association with schizophrenia (p ⫽
.004) and cognitive defects in episodic memory in ser704 schizophrenic homozygotes. ser/ser subjects, with and without a
diagnosis of schizophrenia, also had lower wisconsin card sort
test scores, suggesting a defect in working memory, significantly
reduced hippocampal gray matter volume in healthy ser/ser
control subjects (corrected p ⬍ .05) and increased activation of
the hippocampal formation during working memory tasks, as
well as abnormal hippocampal formation engagement during
declarative memory tasks (corrected p ⬍ .05). a similar trend in
hippocampal volume has also been reported for hep1 (cannon
et al 2005). burdick et al (2005) reported that two snps were
associated with rapid visual search and verbal working memory. as
a cautionary note, these associations were significant only in their
african american sample (p ⫽ .001, p ⫽ .002) and not within the
european american sample, inconsistent with the finnish/american
studies. finally, a recent study examined the effect of the ser704cys
variant on cognitive ability in an old age cohort (thomson et al
2005a). no correlation was found for any of the cognitive domains
tested, but because the same subjects were tested at age 11 and
again at age 79 for general cognitive ability by the same moray
house test, it was uniquely possible also to test for an effect on
cognitive aging. women homozygous for the cys allele were seen
to have poorer aging profiles than men (p ⫽ .003).
whether variation of ser704cys in disc1 is causative or in
linkage disequilibrium with the functional variant has yet to be
formally established. indeed, apart from the original t(1;11) case,
there are as yet no clear-cut mutations in disc1. an exon 12
frameshift mutation has been reported in an american family
with multiple psychiatric diagnoses and affected members (sachs
et al 2005). the mutation is present in two individuals with a
diagnosis of schizophrenia and one with schizoaffective disorder, but not in two individuals diagnosed with major depression
or one diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder, so a firm
verdict on causality awaits both functional studies and independent replication.
in sum, the emerging picture is of genetic variation in disc1
conferring a generalized susceptibility to a broad spectrum of
psychiatric illness and also to altered cognition in normal subjects, mediated through multiple risk haplotypes, consistent with
allelic heterogeneity and compatible with differential effects on
disc1 expression, isoforms, and function that each might go
some way toward explaining the diversity of phenotypic associations. still crucially lacking, however, is any clear-cut evidence
for explanatory functional variants other than in the original
t(1;11) family.

the emerging biology of disc1
expression in psychiatric patient material
the t(1;11)(q42;q14) translocation directly disrupts disc1
within intron 8, removing exons 9 –13 to chromosome 11. it is
therefore possible that transcription of exons 1– 8 of the disrupted allele still occurs, leading to production of an aberrant
truncated protein. it is difficult to predict the hypothetical protein
structure because it would depend on the use of a cryptic
transcription stop site and polyadenylation signal as well as a
cryptic translation stop site supplied by chromosome 1 or 11
material (or both). to be detected (and have any functional
www.sobp.org/journal

d.j. porteous et al
consequence), any such hypothetical product would have to
evade cellular surveillance mechanisms such as nonsense-mediated mrna decay (weischenfeldt et al 2005).
in the absence of central nervous system tissue from individuals carrying this translocation, the search for evidence for or
against a truncated protein has been addressed using a panel of
lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from translocation carriers and
their karyotypically normal relatives (millar et al 2005a). these
cell lines display the same profile of disc1 expression as has
been detected in whole fetal human brain tissue (james et al
2004), indicating that they are a reasonable model to use for
investigating the consequences of disruption on disc1 expression.
by using an exonic snp that is heterozygous in a single cell
line, transcription of both the normal and the derived chromosome 1 allele of disc1 could be demonstrated; however, using
primers specific for exon 2 (able to detect truncated transcripts)
in real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) experiments, overall disc1 transcript levels are clearly reduced (millar et al 2005a).
more direct evidence against a truncated protein product comes
from antibody studies. using an antibody specific for an epitope
within exon 2 and thus able to detect the hypothetical truncated
disc1 protein, no abnormal truncated protein was detected in
any of the lymphoblastoid cell lines carrying the translocation
(millar et al 2005a). this antibody does however demonstrate
convincingly that disc1 expression levels are reduced by approximately half. the most probable disease mechanism is thus
haploinsufficiency (millar et al 2005a). this must be taken into
account when interpreting the interesting, yet possibly nonphysiologic, effects of overexpressing truncated disc1 constructs
(brandon et al 2004, 2005; kamiya et al 2005; millar et al 2005b;
morris et al 2003; ozeki et al 2003).
in a similar vein, the exon 12 frameshift mutation reported by
sachs et al (2005) introduces a premature stop codon and could
theoretically result in c-terminally truncated protein production
if stable mutant transcripts were produced and translated. as
with the t(1;11) translocation, however, the mutant transcript is
expressed at reduced levels in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived
from mutation carriers. it is not yet known whether any truncated
disc1 protein is produced from these mutant transcripts.
disc1 expression has been examined in postmortem brain
tissue from the stanley foundation brain collection. in orbitofrontal cortex from patients with schizophrenia and major depression, there is no global alteration of disc1 levels, but there
is evidence that the overall subcellular distribution may be
altered (p ⫽ .018, p ⫽ .0091 respectively), perhaps reflecting an
increase in the nuclear disc1 pool (sawamura et al 2005).
although this is a potentially interesting finding, confounding
effects of postmortem interval and severity of substance and
alcohol abuse may have contributed to the apparent change of
localization (sawamura et al 2005).
isoforms
disc1 is subject to alternative splicing (james et al 2004; millar
et al 2000; taylor et al 2003; reviewed in millar et al 2004), and
several protein species have been detected (james et al 2004;
myoshi et al 2004; ozeki et al 2003; sawamura et al 2005; schurov
et al 2004), but how these relate to the known splicoforms is not
yet clear. intriguingly, the various disc1 isoforms have distinct
developmental patterns of expression in the mouse with the
peak of full-length protein expression in the brain coinciding
with neurogenesis and puberty (ozeki et al 2003; schurov et al
2004).

d.j. porteous et al
subcellular targeting
disc1 subcellular localization is complex and cell type–
specific. immunofluorescence and co-fractionation of cell extracts show that the mitochondrion is the major site of endogenous disc1 expression in transformed cell lines (james et al
2004; millar et al 2005a, 2005b; ozeki et al 2003) and in cultured
mouse cortical neurons (brandon et al 2005). this is despite the
lack of a known mitochondrial targeting sequence. exogenously
expressed human disc1 also markedly associates with mitochondria and can affect mitochondrial morphology (millar et al
2005b). exogenously expressed disc1 is also prominent at the
centrosome (millar et al 2005b; morris et al 2003; myoshi et al
2004), and centrosomal expression of endogenous disc1 has
since been confirmed in cell lines and rat primary cortical
neurons (kamiya et al 2005). further sites of endogenous disc1
expression include the cytoplasm and nucleus (james et al 2004;
sawamura et al 2005), with organization along actin stress fibers
also reported (james et al 2004; myoshi et al 2003).
amino acids 1–350 are sufficient for mitochondrial targeting,
whereas removal of c-terminal amino acids 598 – 854 virtually
abolishes trafficking to the centrosome (millar et al 2005b),
consistent with the presence of binding sites for centrosomal
proteins within this region (brandon et al 2004; ozeki et al 2003).
the head domain of disc1 possesses putative nuclear localization signals (brandon et al 2005; ma et al 2002) and a putative
nuclear export signal (brandon et al 2005), but utilization of
these signals is minimal in the full-length protein (brandon et al
2005; millar et al 2005b). removal of c-terminal sequences,
particularly amino acids 351– 854, does, however, result in strong
nuclear disc1 expression, suggesting that the nuclear localization signal activity is suppressed by properties of the c-terminus
(millar et al 2005b).
because disc1 targets multiple subcellular compartments, it
is likely to be critical to diverse cellular processes, possibly
through diverse mechanisms and subsets of protein interactions.
defining the spatiotemporal nature and cell specificity of disc1
binding to its various partners becomes a key objective.

expression in brain
disc1 is widely expressed (millar et al 2000; ozeki et al 2003),
but the focus has been on brain expression. studies of rat,
mouse, primate, and human brain tissue, using the complementary techniques of rna in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, broadly agree that the main sites of expression in
adult brain are neurons of the hippocampus, cerebral cortex,
cerebellum, and olfactory bulb (austin et al 2003, 2004; honda et
al 2004; james et al 2004; ma et al 2002; myoshi et al 2003;
schurov et al 2004), with hypothalamic expression also observed
in most studies (austin et al 2003, 2004; ma et al 2002; schurov et
al 2004). in the developing rodent brain, disc1 expression is
particularly prominent from the earliest stages of hippocampal
formation (austin et al 2003; honda et al 2004; myoshi et al
2003), consistent with the evidence from callicott et al (2005).
the sites of disc1 expression within the central nervous system
(austin et al 2003, 2004) match those implicated in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders, with reduced hippocampal
volume and memory impairment common features of schizophrenia (reviewed by murray et al 2004). thus, the mechanism
by which disc1 confers susceptibility to psychiatric illness may
operate in part within hippocampal neurons. it is also worth
noting that disc1 expression is high within the dentate gyrus, a
site of postnatal and indeed adult neurogenesis (eriksson et al
1998).

role of disc1 in neurodevelopment, neuronal
signaling, and cognition
disc1-interacting proteins
disc1 shows no significant homology to other proteins so
clues to function are limited, but the c-terminal coiled-coil
domain would certainly be expected to interact with other
proteins (taylor et al 2003). a large number of yeast-2-hybrid
studies have now been conducted (reviewed by millar et al
2004). camargo et al (2005) recently reported a network analysis
of 12 screens using either disc1 or robust disc1 interactors,

incorporating 127 proteins and involving 158 interactions. statistical analysis highlighted proteins involved in cell division, in
actin and microtubule cytoskeletal organization and in intracellular transport, together suggesting a highly connected “disc1
interactome.” table 3 summarizes the current status of confirmed
interactors. here we focus on nudel (ndel1), currently the best
studied, and on  xxxg1698xxx  ( xxxg1698xxx ), the most recent
and exciting.
nde1 (nude) and its orthologue ndel1 (nudel) were identified as interactors with lis1, mutations in which cause lissencephaly, a disorder of cortical lamination (ross and walsh 2001).
in the mouse, homozygous knockout of nde1 causes microcephaly, especially in the cerebral cortex, due to reduced progenitor
cell division and altered neuronal cell fate (feng and walsh
2004). at the molecular level, these defects are due to the
essential role for nde1 in centrosome duplication and mitotic
spindle assembly (feng and walsh 2004). ndel1 homozygous
mutants have defects in neuronal migration and are earlyembryonic lethal (sasaki et al 2005). downregulation of ndel1
using rnai technology has elegantly shown that ndel1 positively
regulates dynein activity via interaction with lis1 and is essential
for microtubule organization, nuclear translocation, and neuronal positioning (shu et al 2004). disc1 is associated with this
centrosomal complex and upregulates the function of the dynein
motor complex by accumulating and stabilizing it at the centrosome (kamiya et al 2005). again using rnai technology, but now
to reduce disc1 expression in utero, it has been shown that
disc1 is essential for proper neuronal migration within the
cerebral cortex (kamiya et al 2005). in utero overexpression of a
truncated form of disc1 (mutdisc1) produces a similar phenotype (kamiya et al 2005). we conjecture that disc1 targeting of
lis1, dynein, and ndel1 to the centrosome is reduced by binding
of endogenous disc1 by mutdisc1.
ndel1 is also known as endo-oligopeptidase a (eopa), a
 xxxg548xxx  with activity in vitro against unstructured
oligopeptides (camargo et al 1979), including  xxxg1618xxx , receptor agonists for which are putative antipsychotics (kinkead
and nemeroff 2004). the critical cysteine is located at residue 273
(hayashi et al 2005), adjacent to the disc1 binding site, centered
around the residues leucine 266 and glutamate 267 (brandon et
al 2004). disc1 inhibits the enzymatic activity of eopa/ndel1
(hayashi et al 2005). the interaction domain with ndel1 maps to
the c-terminus of disc1 (brandon et al 2004; ozeki et al 2003).
this tantalizing link between eopa/ndel1 activity and schizophrenia merits further investigation. reduction in the level of
full-length disc1 protein would be predicted to dysregulate
neuronal migration and dysinhibit eopa activity.
a recent breakthrough in the disc1 field comes from identifying a direct interaction with camp phosphodiesterase  xxxg1698xxx 
(millar et al 2005a). the pde4 family of phosphodiesterases have
been previously implicated in cognitive and mood disorders
(cooke and bliss 2005; davis et al 1995; renau 2004). pdes are
the sole means of catabolizing cellular cyclic  xxxd81xxx  (camp), a key signaling molecule (bauman et al 2004;
davis et al 1995; lamprecht 1999). the cognate gene when
mutated in drosophila is called “dunce” and shows reduced
learning and memory (davis et al 1995). pde4 is also the target
for the antidepressant  xxxd3142xxx  (o’donnell and zhang 2004). the
n-terminus (amino acids 219-283) of disc1 binds directly to the
ucr2 regulatory domain of  xxxg1698xxx . moreover, disc1 sequesters
 xxxg1698xxx  in an inactive state and releases it upon elevation in the
level of camp (millar et al 2005a). genetic support for this
enticing biochemical link between disc1 and  xxxg1698xxx  came from
www.sobp.org/journal

d.j. porteous et al
the identification of a schizophrenic proband and psychotic
cousin who carry a balanced t(1;16)(p31.2;q21) translocation that
disrupts the  xxxg1698xxx  gene on chromosome 1 (millar et al 2005a).
when taken together, the genetic and functional evidence point
persuasively to a role of disc1- xxxg1698xxx  in the cognitive aspects of
mental illness.
that disc1 shows a marked developmental expression profile in the central nervous system, is widely expressed in the
brain and elsewhere, and occupies multiple cell compartments
points to a multiplicity of functions, the nuances of which are
important to determine. these functions will be codetermined by
the coexpression of key functional interactors. inter alia, the
relationship to both normal and abnormal brain development
and function will be affected by the qualities and quantities of
protein expression. in the context of the complex genetic and
neurological architecture of schizophrenia and related disorders,
the multifunctional nature of disc1 provides a potential explanation for how a net 50% reduction of this one protein can
account for the high penetrance of major mental illness (70% of
translocation carriers affected) in the t(1;11) family. other genetic
mechanisms that modulate the net level of disc1 expression may
explain the mounting evidence for this being a key, generalized
risk factor in the schizophrenia to bipolar spectrum. de facto, key
disc1 interactors are worthy of study as independent and
codependent candidate genetic risk factors.

concluding remarks and future directions
the discovery of disc1 locus through the genomewide
molecular cytogenetic search strategy sets a useful paradigm that
is highly relevant to biological psychiatry. the identification of
dibd1 (baysal et al 2002), npas3 (pickard et al 2005a),  xxxg961xxx 
(pickard et al, submitted), and  xxxg1698xxx  (millar et al 2005a) further
demonstrates the utility and relevance to scz and bpad. additional genes will soon be reported from our pipeline (pickard et
al, in preparation). important examples are coming from allied
areas of research as well, such as language disability (lai et al
2001).
the independent genetic evidence for disc1 as a risk factor is
greatly welcomed because it has undoubtedly drawn wider
attention to this locus and helped dispel earlier skepticism about
the validity and general relevance of the original finding. key
questions remain, however. is there a common ancient variant of
disc1, or is there locus and allelic heterogeneity? more refined
association studies are warranted and the identification of explanatory functional variants is needed. is only disc1 relevant or
does disc2 affect disc1 expression? studies to determine the
quantitative and qualitative effects of genetic variation on disc1
function are a priority. these will include effects on the pattern
of isoform expression, subcellular location, and the capacity to
interact with key effectors, such as ndel1 and  xxxg1698xxx . what is the
population attributable risk of disc variation? the growing
evidence from multiple independent linkage and association
studies suggests that it may be sizeable. the hep3 haplotype is
present in 30% of finnish families (hennah et al 2005b). hennah
et al (2005a) recently reported preliminary evidence that when
conditioned for hep3, strong linkage to the nude1 locus
emerges, which was confirmed by association analysis.  xxxg1698xxx 
association studies are also positive (pickard et al, in preparation).
even at this early stage, the nature of the disc1 interactors
sheds welcome light on biological etiology. that ndel1,  xxxg1698xxx ,
and other confirmed interactors were already known to have

figure 2. schematic diagram of a neuron showing established disc1 protein–protein interactions and their subcellular localization. the disc1/
ndel1/lis1 complex is the most thoroughly studied and is known to act at
the centrosome where it plays a role in neuronal migration. ndel1 has also
been shown to have oligopeptidase activity (ndel1/eopa), but the subcellular site for this is not currently known; it is likely to be cytosolic, however.
the disc1-pde4 complex, which regulates cyclic  xxxd81xxx  levels, has been shown to colocalize with mitochondria as indicated
but may also be present in other subcellular sites. disc1 has also been
shown to be found in the nucleus, but at present no in vivo substantiated
interaction partners though  xxxg208xxx /5 have been shown to bind disc1 (not
shown). finally, disc1 has been shown to be found in the psd and associated with the actin cytoskeleton, potentially in dendritic spines. adapted
with permission from figure 3 in ishizuka et al (2006).

important roles in brain development and function was reassuring, but much still needs to be established as to the precise
consequences of genetic variation in disc1—and indeed in
disc1 interactors themselves. it is worth noting, however, that
the putative function of disc1 as a “hub” or “node” protein that
connects multiple proteins and functions provides an attractive
explanation for how quantitative variation in one protein might
have systemic effects on multiple pathways related to a complexity of processes underlying normal and dysfunctional brain
development and chemistry (poklington et al 2006). disc1 also
offers up the equally testable hypothesis that allelic variation
affecting some, but not all interactions might neatly explain
association with a subset of clinical and endophenotypes. finally, the endo-oligopeptidase activity of ndel1 and the phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of camp by  xxxg1698xxx  are what
are generally considered to be tractable drug targets. the need
for improved, rational interventions in major mental illness and
the dearth of novel pharmacologics may be answered in part
through the discovery of disc1.
