abstract
 xxxd2445xxx  (lapatinib) is a  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor in clinical development for cancer that is a potent dual inhibitor of epidermal growth
factor receptor (egfr,  xxxg682xxx -1) and  xxxg682xxx -2. we determined the crystal
structure of egfr bound to  xxxd2445xxx . the compound is bound to an
inactive-like conformation of egfr that is very different from the activelike structure bound by the selective  xxxd1256xxx  osi-774 (tarceva)
described previously. surprisingly, we found that  xxxd2445xxx  has a very
slow off-rate from the purified intracellular domains of egfr and
 xxxg682xxx -2 compared with osi-774 and another egfr selective inhibitor,
 xxxd2186xxx  (iressa). treatment of tumor cells with these inhibitors results in
down-regulation of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. we evaluated the
duration of the drug effect after washing away free compound and found
that the rate of recovery of receptor phosphorylation in the tumor cells
reflected the inhibitor off-rate from the purified intracellular domain. the
slow off-rate of  xxxd2445xxx  correlates with a prolonged down-regulation
of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in tumor cells. the differences in the
off-rates of these drugs and the ability of  xxxd2445xxx  to inhibit  xxxg682xxx -2 can
be explained by the enzyme-inhibitor structures.

introduction
several new cancer therapies are being developed that target the
 xxxg682xxx  receptor  xxxg2198xxx  family. the receptors are multidomain
proteins that contain an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single
transmembrane domain, and an intracellular  xxxg2198xxx  domain.
the family has three catalytically active members, epidermal growth
factor receptor (egfr;  xxxg682xxx -1),  xxxg682xxx -2, and  xxxg682xxx -4. a fourth member of the family,  xxxg682xxx -3, does not have  xxxg2198xxx  activity but
retains ligand-binding function and is competent for signal transduction (1).
inhibition of the  xxxg2198xxx  activity of these receptors is one
approach for therapeutic intervention (2, 3). at least four erbbtargeted  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors are currently in phase ii clinical
trials or beyond. these include  xxxd2186xxx  (iressa), osi-774 (tarceva),
 xxxd2445xxx  (lapatinib), and  xxxd421xxx  (3). these compounds share a
common 4-anilinoquinazoline core, but they have distinct  xxxg682xxx  inhibition profiles and mechanisms of action.  xxxd2186xxx  and osi-774 are
potent, selective inhibitors of egfr (4, 5).  xxxd2445xxx  is a potent
inhibitor of both egfr and  xxxg682xxx -2 (6, 7).  xxxd421xxx  was designed to
covalently modify an active site cysteine from a template with high
initial binding affinity for egfr.  xxxg682xxx -2 and  xxxg682xxx -4 contain the
same active site cys, so  xxxd421xxx  inhibits these receptors as well (8).

receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in intact cells and  xxxg682xxx -driven
tumor growth in tissue culture and animal models (7). the compound
was selected for drug discovery progression because of these and
other desirable properties. during the discovery phase of the
 xxxd2445xxx  program, we evaluated many different substituted quinazoline compounds and found that potent inhibition of purified receptors was not enough to guarantee potent inhibition in intact cells (7,
9 –11). in this report we present a detailed evaluation of inhibitor
potency,  xxxg682xxx  receptor selectivity, and inhibitor-enzyme dissociation
rate in an effort to better understand the biological activity of molecules in this series. we find that  xxxd2445xxx  has a unique mechanism
of action. it exhibits reversible, noncovalent inhibition of egfr and
 xxxg682xxx -2, but it has a very slow off-rate compared with other reversible
4-anilinoquinazoline compounds.
the crystal structures of apo-egfr and egfr bound to osi-774
(osi-774/egfr) were described recently (12). the egfr structure
reveals key features associated with egfr regulation and catalytic
activity. the osi-774/egfr structure provides the basic binding
mode of the 4-anilinoquinazoline core and identifies key interactions
that provide potency and selectivity for egfr inhibition. the reasons
for the slow off-rate for  xxxd2445xxx  relative to other 4-anilinoquinazoline inhibitors is not readily apparent from the compound structure
or models based on the osi-774/egfr protein structure. for this
reason we determined that the crystal structure of egfr bound to
 xxxd2445xxx  ( xxxd2445xxx /egfr).  xxxd2445xxx /egfr has a significantly different structure than osi-774/egfr. the potential relationship between this novel egfr structure and the off-rates for 4-anilinoquinazoline inhibitors are discussed. moreover, the structure may
help shed light on previously unexplained aspects of  xxxg682xxx  receptor
activation and selectivity of 4-anilinoquinazoline inhibitors.
the dissociation rate of the inhibitor-receptor complex or overall
enzyme receptor structure may impact the potency or duration of
receptor inhibition in biological models. down-regulation of receptor
autophosphorylation in tumor cell lines is a reliable measure of  xxxg682xxx 
inhibitor action. we evaluated the recovery of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in tumor cells after washing away free compound. receptor phosphorylation after treatment with  xxxd2445xxx  recovers very
slowly in a manner that reflects the dissociation rate of the inhibitor
from the purified enzyme.

0.8 ␮mol/l, and the concentration of atp was 10 ␮mol/l unless otherwise
indicated.
to measure the ic50 for enzyme inhibition, the indicated compound was
serially diluted 1 to 3 in  xxxd1896xxx  and added to the reactions to
produce an 11-point dose-response curve ranging from 0.00005 to 5 ␮mol/l.
the ic50 values were estimated from data fit to equation a:

y ⫽ v max兵1 ⫺ 关 x/共k ⫹ x兲兴其 ⫹ y2

(a)

vmax is the curve fit parameter that represents the upper asymptote of the dose
response. this value is typically equivalent to the level of product formed in
the absence of inhibitor. x is the variable representing the concentration of
inhibitor. k is the curve fit parameter for the ic50 value. this occurs at the
inflection point of the dose response. y2 is the curve fit parameter that
represents the lower asymptote of the dose response. for a potent inhibitor, y2
is equivalent to the assay baseline (signal in the absence of enzyme activity).
for kiapp determinations, ic50s were obtained for each compound using
eight different concentrations of atp in the enzyme assay, 10, 40, 70, 100,
130, 160, 190, and 220 ␮mol/l. within an experiment each ic50 was determined in triplicate. three independent experiments were performed, and the
average ic50 was plotted as a function of the concentration atp. the inhibitors
that we have evaluated have been determined previously to be competitive
with atp. therefore, the kiapp values were obtained from a least squares fit of
the data to equation b (16):

we evaluated the recovery of enzyme activity from a preformed enzyme–
inhibitor complex to estimate inhibitor off-rate. enzyme and inhibitor, 500 nm
each, were incubated together in 50 mmol/l  xxxd2679xxx 
(ph 7.5) and 0.01% tween for 30 minutes at ambient temperature. this
complex was diluted 1:1,000 into standard enzyme assay mixtures containing
200 ␮mol/l atp. the reaction was allowed to proceed for the indicated time,
and the phosphorylated peptide product was measured. the data were fit to
equation c (17):

the value kobs represents the rate of change from vr (velocity at t ⫽ 0) to vs
(velocity upon equilibrium). using these reaction conditions, essentially 100%
of the enzyme is bound by inhibitor in the preformed complex such that vr ⫽ 0.
upon reaching equilibrium, the total inhibitor concentration is 0.5 nm. the
concentration of atp is 40 ⫻ kmatp so that at equilibrium, all of the free
enzyme is essentially occupied by atp, and vs ⫽ 100% of control reactions
run in the absence of inhibitor. to be sure that these conditions hold true,
control reactions with inhibitor added to the reaction mix (0.5 nm) without
being preincubated with enzyme were conducted, and the rate was the same as
the rate in the absence of inhibitor.
for all of the data analysis described above, nonlinear regressions were
conducted using the program sigma plot (jandel scientific, san rafael, ca).

potency and selectivity of 4-anilinoquinazoline  xxxg682xxx  inhibitors. different laboratories have used different methods to evaluate
the potency and selectivity of the 4-anilinoquinazoline  xxxg682xxx  inhibitors
in clinical development. potency and selectivity measurements can be
affected by experimental conditions, especially enzyme and substrate
concentrations and incubation times. to provide directly comparable
estimates of potency and selectivity, we evaluated enzyme inhibition
using a purified enzyme assay system consisting of the recombinant
human intracellular domain of each catalytically active  xxxg682xxx  family
member (15).
the dissociation constant for an inhibitor, ki, is the best standard of
comparison for potency and selectivity. we estimated kiapp (ki determined at a single fixed concentration of peptide) by measuring the
initial rate of product formation at varied inhibitor concentrations
using eight fixed concentrations of atp. all of the 4-anilinoquinazoline inhibitors being evaluated are potent inhibitors of egfr with
reported ic50 values close to the concentration of enzyme normally
required to achieve an adequate assay signal (4 – 8). therefore, the
data were fit to equation b, which takes into account the concentration of active enzyme in the assay. this allowed us to estimate kiapp
values below the enzyme concentration limit (16). we determined the
kiapp for egfr using  xxxd2186xxx  and  xxxd2445xxx  (fig. 1). the ic50
value for each compound increased with increasing atp concentration as expected for a competitive inhibitor. the kiapp values were
estimated from the slopes of the lines formed by fitting the data to
equation b. similar experiments were conducted with  xxxd2186xxx ,
osi-774, and  xxxd2445xxx  using egfr,  xxxg682xxx -2, and  xxxg682xxx -4 (table
1). the kiapp values for egfr that we obtained using  xxxd2186xxx  and
osi-774 were 0.4 and 0.7 nm, respectively. these values are lower
than the previously reported ki values of 2.1 ⫾ 0.2 nm for  xxxd2186xxx 
(4) and 2.7 nm for osi-774 (5). the inclusion of the enzyme concentration term in our analysis may contribute to these observed differences.  xxxd2186xxx  and osi-774 are both ⬎1,000-fold selective for
egfr over  xxxg682xxx -2 with kiapp values near 1 ␮mol/l for  xxxg682xxx -2.

enzymes by covalently modifying an active site cysteine (8). for
compounds of this sort, kiapp estimates as determined in these studies
are not appropriate evaluations of binding potency. nevertheless, we
measured the ic50 of  xxxd421xxx  for egfr,  xxxg682xxx -2, and  xxxg682xxx -4 after 20
minutes of incubation time to estimate the affinity of this compound
for the different  xxxg682xxx  enzymes.  xxxd421xxx  is a potent pan- xxxg682xxx  inhibitor that inhibits egfr,  xxxg682xxx -2, and  xxxg682xxx -4 with ic50 values of 30,
127, and 388 nm, respectively.
 xxxd2445xxx  is unique among the molecules studied, because it is a
reversible inhibitor that is potent against both egfr and  xxxg682xxx -2 with
estimated kiapp values of 3 nm and 13 nm, respectively.
inhibitor dissociation rates. preliminary evaluation of ic50 as a
function of time suggested that  xxxd2445xxx  exhibited time-dependent
behavior. to characterize this behavior further, we evaluated the
inhibitor off-rate using an enzyme reactivation procedure. egfr and
inhibitor were incubated for 30 minutes to allow formation of an
enzyme-inhibitor complex. this complex was diluted extensively into
a reaction mixture containing a high concentration of atp (40 ⫻ km),
and phosphorylated product was evaluated as a function of time (fig.
2). under these conditions, the change in the rate of product formation
reflects the dissociation of the enzyme–inhibitor complex (17). dissociation of  xxxd2186xxx , osi-774, and  xxxd2445xxx  were compared (fig.
2a). the rates of product formation in the presence of  xxxd2186xxx  and
osi-774 were virtually indistinguishable from the rate of product
formation in the absence of inhibitor. this indicates a rapid off-rate
(half-life ⬍ 10 min). in contrast, enzyme activity after preincubation
with  xxxd2445xxx  recovered very slowly suggesting that the compound
had a much slower off-rate.
to estimate this slow off-rate, we compared  xxxd2445xxx  to the
covalent modifier  xxxd421xxx  and ran the reactions for a longer period of
time (fig. 2b). no recovery of enzyme activity was seen after preincubation with  xxxd421xxx . in contrast, phosphorylated product was detected 50 minutes after dilution of the egfr- xxxd2445xxx  complex.
the off-rate estimated from the fit of data to equation c is
0.0023 ⫾ 0.0002 per minute. this translates to a half-life of 300
minutes for the  xxxd2445xxx -egfr complex.  xxxd2445xxx  is a potent
inhibitor of egfr and  xxxg682xxx -2, so we compared the dissociation of the
compound from both enzymes (fig. 2c).  xxxd2445xxx  also has a very
slow off-rate for  xxxg682xxx -2.
the slow recovery of enzyme activity indicates that  xxxd2445xxx 
binds in a reversible fashion. because the recovery was slow, however, we evaluated whether or not  xxxd2445xxx  forms a stable covalent
bond with egfr using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
egfr that was incubated with  xxxd421xxx  had a molecular weight
consistent with the formation of a single modified cysteine residue as
reported previously for a closely related compound (20). egfr incubated with  xxxd2445xxx  had a molecular weight identical to that of
untreated egfr, which indicated that a stable covalent bond was not
formed between the protein and compound (data not shown).
duration of inhibition in tumor cells. exposure to kinase inhibitors causes the down-regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of
 xxxg682xxx  receptors in tumor cells (4, 5, 7). we examined the recovery of
receptor phosphorylation after inhibitor washout to determine whether
there is a correlation between inhibitor dissociation rate and recovery
of autophosphorylation (fig. 3). logarithmically growing hn5 cells
that naturally overexpress egfr (21) were treated for 4 hours with
 xxxd2445xxx , osi-774, and  xxxd2186xxx  (1 ␮mol/l). after treatment, the
inhibitor containing media was removed, cells were rinsed extensively, and fresh media without inhibitor was added. the cells were
lysed at various times after inhibitor washout, and egfr was captured
by immunoprecipitation. the relative receptor content was determined
by immunoblot with a separate antireceptor antibody, and the state of
phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoblot with an antiphospho-

slower but had reached 60% of control levels after 72 hours. receptor
phosphorylation in  xxxd2445xxx -treated cells had only recovered to
15% of control levels 96 hours after washout. these results suggest
that the very slow inhibitor dissociation rate of  xxxd2445xxx  may
increase the duration of suppression of  xxxg682xxx  receptor activity in tumor
cells.
crystal structure of  xxxd2445xxx /egfr. the dramatic differences between the off-rates observed for  xxxd2445xxx  and osi-774
suggested that the two compounds were binding to egfr in different
ways. to test this hypothesis, we evaluated the binding mode of
 xxxd2445xxx  by determining the crystal structure of egfr bound to the
inhibitor. the structure of  xxxd2445xxx /egfr was solved to 2.4 å
resolution and contains the kinase domain, as well as 40 residues of
the cooh-terminal tail. the overall fold of the protein is similar to
that observed in apo-egfr and osi-774/egfr structures (12). however, there are significant differences in the orientation of the nh2and cooh-terminal lobes, the cooh-terminal tail, and the c helix,
as described below. six residues at the nh2 terminus, 8 residues at the
cooh-terminus, and five short loop regions (residues 710 to 713, 726
to 730, 844 to 851, 964 to 970, and 980 to 983) are not included in the
final model due to poor electron density.

crystal structures (refs. 12, 22; fig. 4). the quinazoline ring is hydrogen bonded to the hinge region between the nh2- and coohterminal lobes of the kinase. n1 of the quinazoline is hydrogen
bonded to the main chain nh of met769, whereas n3 makes a
water-mediated hydrogen bond to the side chain of thr830. the
quinazoline ring is sandwiched from the top and bottom by the side
chains of ala719 and leu820, respectively. the 3⬘-chloro-4⬘-[(3fluorobenzyl)oxy]aniline group is oriented deep in the back of the
atp binding site and makes predominantly hydrophobic interactions
with the protein. the 3⬘-chloro-aniline group is positioned in a pocket
formed by the side chains of val702, lys721, leu764, thr766,
thr830, and asp831. the 3-fluorobenzyloxy group occupies a pocket
formed by the side chains of met742, leu753, thr766, thr830,
phe832, and leu834. the aniline nitrogen and the ether oxygen are
not involved in any direct hydrogen bonding interactions with the
protein. the methylsulfonylethylaminomethylfuryl group, off the c6
position of the quinazoline, is positioned at the solvent interface and
does not make any significant interactions with the protein. the
methylsulfonylethylamino group is bound near asp776 but is poorly
defined.
comparison with osi-774/egfr. the structure of  xxxd2445xxx /
egfr is very different from the structure of osi-774/egfr. these
differences include the shape of the atp binding site, the position of
the c helix, the conformations of the cooh-terminal tail and activation loop, and the hydrogen bonding pattern with the quinazoline ring
of the inhibitors.
the nh2- and cooh-terminal lobes of kinases are connected by a
flexible hinge region. the relative orientation of the two lobes with
respect to one another influences the shape of the atp binding cleft
and is dependent on the activation state of the kinase and the presence
of ligands. the atp binding cleft of  xxxd2445xxx /egfr is in a
relatively closed conformation. this conformation is similar to the

atp binding clefts in inactive src and  xxxg1028xxx  (23–25). the atp binding
cleft in osi-774/egfr is in a more open conformation. the nh2terminal lobe in egfr/ xxxd2445xxx  is rotated ⬃12° relative to its
position in egfr/osi-774 (fig. 5).
the atp binding site of  xxxd2445xxx /egfr has a larger back
pocket than apo-egfr or osi-774/egfr. the larger pocket is created by an ⬃9 å shift in one end of the c helix to accommodate the
3-fluorobenzyl-oxy group of  xxxd2445xxx  (fig. 6). the 3-fluorobenzyloxy group occupies roughly the same space as met742 in the c helix
of egfr/osi-774. the shift in the c helix results in the loss of a
highly conserved glu-lys salt bridge (glu738 and lys721) that
ligates the phosphate groups of atp. in  xxxd2445xxx /egfr, lys721 is
hydrogen bonded to the side chain of asp831, located in the coohterminal lobe, and glu738 points out toward solvent.
the cooh-terminal tail of egfr contains several sites of autophosphorylation and plays a key role in signal transduction by serving
as a docking site for signaling molecules that bind to the phosphorylated tyrosines. forty residues of the cooh-terminal tail were included in the egfr constructs used in these crystallographic studies.
in apo-egfr and osi-774/egfr, the cooh terminus is poorly
defined and is loosely associated with two symmetry-related molecules. in  xxxd2445xxx /egfr, residues 971 to 980 of the coohterminal tail form a short ␣ helix that packs along the hinge region
connecting the nh2- and cooh-terminal lobes (fig. 5). this helix
partially blocks the front of the atp binding cleft. a second helical
segment containing residues 983 to 990 extends along the nh2terminal lobe of the protein.
protein kinases contain a large flexible loop, called the activation
loop or a-loop that regulates kinase activity (26, 27). apo-egfr and
osi-774/egfr have a-loop conformations (residues 831 to 860) that
are similar to a-loops found in active kinase structures.  xxxd2445xxx /
egfr has an a-loop conformation similar to that observed in crystal

bond with egfr differently. the quinazoline n1 of both compounds
accepts a hydrogen bond from the main chain nh of met769. however, n3 of  xxxd2445xxx  makes a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the
side chain of thr830 (fig. 4). n3 of osi-774 makes a water-mediated
hydrogen bond with the side chain of thr766. the side chain of
thr766 in  xxxd2445xxx /egfr points away from the quinazoline and
hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl of arg752. interestingly,
blencke et al. (28) showed that mutation of thr766 to methionine in
egfr leads to resistance to the 4-anilinoquinazoline pd153035.
pd153035, like osi-774, has a small 4-aniline substituent and is
predicted to share a similar binding mode. this mutation may not
affect inhibition by compounds that bind like  xxxd2445xxx .
it is important to note that the structures for  xxxd2445xxx /egfr and
osi-774/egfr described above were derived from crystals obtained
using different methods. the published osi-774/egfr structure was
derived from apo-egfr crystals that had been soaked with the
inhibitor to obtain the bound complex (12). the  xxxd2445xxx /egfr
structure was derived from crystals created by cocrystallization of
egfr and inhibitor. unfortunately, acceptable cocrystals could not be
obtained by soaking  xxxd2445xxx  into the apo-egfr crystal. this
probably results from the inability of the bulky aniline substitution of
the compound to form a complex with the small back pocket found in
the active-like conformation of apo-egfr. nevertheless, we believe
these technical differences do not contribute to the observed structural
differences for three reasons: (1) the magnitude of the protein conformation differences exceeds the degree normally caused by different
crystal packing interactions, (2) we have obtained quinazoline/egfr
structures for compounds with small aniline substitutions similar to
osi-774 by cocrystallization and find active-like conformations (data
not shown), and (3) we have obtained compound/egfr structures for
several other compounds with bulky-aniline substitutions similar to
 xxxd2445xxx , and all of these have had similar inactive-like conformations (data not shown).
discussion
our results begin to establish a framework for understanding how
 xxxg682xxx  receptor structure influences the biological activity of kinase
inhibitors in clinical development. we have identified several novel
relationships including connections between protein structure and
inhibitor off-rate, protein structure and receptor selectivity, and protein structure and mechanism of receptor activation.
 xxxg682xxx  structure and inhibitor off-rate. significant differences
in the structure of egfr bound to osi-774 and  xxxd2445xxx  may
explain the differences in their observed dissociation rates. osi-774
and  xxxd2186xxx , which have small aniline substituents off the quinazoline ring, have relatively rapid off-rates. osi-774/egfr has a conformation that is virtually identical to apo-egfr. thus, the rapid
off-rate may reflect the fact that the inhibitor binds and dissociates
from an active form of the enzyme without requiring any major
changes in protein conformation.  xxxd2445xxx , on the other hand, has
a bulky aniline substituent that reaches deep into an opened back
pocket. this back pocket, which is not apparent in apo or osi-774/
egfr, results from a shift in the position of the c-helix. the coohterminal tail is also shifted to a position that partially blocks the
opening of the inhibitor-binding site. it appears that dissociation of
 xxxd2445xxx  may require a conformational change in egfr. a slow
protein conformational change may explain the slow dissociation rate
of  xxxd2445xxx . alternatively, the different structure of  xxxd2445xxx /
egfr may provide a very tight binding affinity that results in the
slow-off rate, and a conformational change may not be involved in
inhibitor dissociation.
treatment of tumor cells with osi-774,  xxxd2186xxx , and  xxxd2445xxx 

results in down-regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of  xxxg682xxx  receptors (4, 5, 7). the recovery of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation after
down-regulation is a complex process that involves the regulation of
receptor kinase activity through inhibitor concentration and dissociation, receptor activation, and autophosphorylation. the rate of recovery may also be affected by additional regulatory mechanisms such as
receptor recycling, degradation, and resynthesis. nevertheless, we
have found that the rate recovery of receptor phosphorylation in tumor
cells reflects the inhibitor off-rate observed in enzyme assays. we
observed very little recovery of egfr tyrosine phosphorylation 96
hours after removal of  xxxd2445xxx . thus, the inhibitor off-rate may be
an important factor that affects the duration of drug activity in vivo.
 xxxg682xxx  structure and inhibitor selectivity.  xxxd2186xxx  and osi-774
are potent inhibitors of egfr but not  xxxg682xxx -2, although  xxxg682xxx -2 has a
very similar catalytic domain (88% identical).  xxxd2445xxx  on the
other hand inhibits both enzymes with similar potency. the
 xxxd2445xxx /egfr structure is very different from the osi-774/egfr
structure. the magnitude of the difference suggests that the two
inhibitors target different forms of the enzyme, active and inactive.
the lack of inhibition of  xxxg682xxx -2 by osi-774 may reflect the inability
of  xxxg682xxx -2 to adopt an active-like conformation as seen in the apo and
osi-774/egfr structures. interestingly, we and others have found
that purified  xxxg682xxx -2 is not very active using atp-mg as a substrate.
the enzyme is 15-fold more active using atp-mn (15). the presence
of atp-mn in the active site of  xxxg682xxx -2 may compensate for a
catalytically inefficient structure that differs from apo-egfr. if apoerbb-2 cannot achieve this active-like structure, then compounds
similar to osi-774 may not be able to bind with high affinity.
our results suggest that  xxxg682xxx  receptor tertiary structure may be a
key component of inhibitor selectivity. the enzyme assays that we
and others have used to describe the egfr/erbb2 inhibitor selectivity
used purified intracellular domains of the receptors (4, 15, 29). thus,
it is possible that inhibitor selectivity could be different in vivo.
experiments with tumor cell lines suggest that this is not the case. for
example, osi-774 effectively inhibits egfr tyrosine phosphorylation
and proliferation of egfr overexpressing tumor lines (5). the compound is not effective, however, at blocking  xxxg682xxx -2 tyrosine phosphorylation (29) or blocking proliferation of tumor cells that overexpress  xxxg682xxx -2 (7). a selective  xxxg682xxx -2 inhibitor, cp-654577, has been
described recently (29). this compound is a 4-anilino-quinazoline
with a bulky aniline substitution somewhat similar to  xxxd2445xxx .
cp-654577 effectively blocks  xxxg682xxx -2 tyrosine phosphorylation in
intact cells but not  xxxg681xxx -stimulated egfr tyrosine
phosphorylation. the dual inhibitor,  xxxd2445xxx , effectively blocks
egfr and  xxxg682xxx -2 autophosphorylation in cells and inhibits the proliferation of tumor cell lines that overexpress either egfr or  xxxg682xxx -2
(7).
 xxxg682xxx  structure and receptor activation. unlike most receptor
tyrosine kinases, autophosphorylation of the a-loop is not required for
 xxxg682xxx  receptor catalytic activity (30, 31). a variety of evidence suggests that ligand-induced dimerization and subsequent conformational
change trigger activity (reviewed in ref. 32). however, the nature of
the conformational change is not understood.
the conformation of  xxxd2445xxx /egfr is similar in many ways to
the inactive conformations of src and  xxxg1028xxx  (23–25). these enzymes
are multidomain kinases that have nh2-terminal sh2 and sh3 regulatory domains linked to the catalytic domain. activity is regulated
by phosphorylation of a specific tyrosine in the cooh-terminal tail.
intramolecular binding of the sh2 domain to this residue keeps the
enzyme in the inactive state. this regulatory mechanism has been
referred to as a switch– clamp–latch model. conformational changes
in the c helix and activation loop constitute the switch. the sh3 and
sh2 domains act like a clamp, fixing the relative orientation of the

nh2- and cooh-terminal lobes. the phosphorylated tyrosine in the
cooh-terminal tail is considered the latch.
activation of egfr and other  xxxg682xxx  receptors may be similar to src
in some respects. if the apo-inactive enzyme has a conformation
similar to  xxxd2445xxx /egfr, then the c helix is in a position that is
not competent for activity. the position of the cooh-terminal tail,
which packs along the hinge, is positioned in such a way that it may
act as a regulatory clamp. dimerization induced by ligand binding
may result in a shift that releases the cooh-terminal tail and allows
the c-helix and a-loop to adopt an active conformation.
conclusions.  xxxd2445xxx /egfr is found in an inactive-like conformation. we do not know if the inhibitor binds to a pre-existing pool
of egfr that is already in this inactive state or if inhibitor binding
induces a change to this conformation. cabl bound to sti-571 (also
known as gleevec and imatinib) also has an inactive-like conformation (33). binding to inactive kinase conformations may provide some
advantages for blocking biological activity through mechanisms related to the overall signal transduction process. alternatively, binding
to an inactive form of a kinase (or inducing this conformation) may
simply provide an advantage by reducing the rate of inhibitor dissociation, allowing for prolonged effects in biological systems after
inhibitor concentrations have dropped. in support of the latter mechanism, we have found that egfr receptor autophosphorylation recovers very slowly in tumor cells after treatment with the slow-off rate
inhibitor  xxxd2445xxx .
our results have important implications for protein kinase drug
discovery.  xxxd2445xxx  binds a form of egfr that is distinct from the
previously described structure of egfr bound to another drug in
clinical development, osi-774. thus, specific drugs may target different forms of the same enzyme. the selectivity of these drugs seems
to be significantly affected by the tertiary structure of the receptor
target. thus, the primary amino acid sequence of the kinase atp
binding site may not be a very good predictor of selectivity. the slow
off-rate, bound egfr structure, and dual  xxxg682xxx  and  xxxg721xxx  inhibition
profile differentiate  xxxd2445xxx  from the other clinical agents tested.
