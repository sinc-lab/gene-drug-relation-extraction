the ability of (?)-norephedrine (phenylpropanolamine) and its component isomers, (+)and (-)-norephedrine, to activate adrenergic receptor subtypes in the cardiovascular
system of the urethanekhloralose-anaesthetizedpithed rat has been investigated. at all
adrenoceptor subtypes, (-)-norephedrine was the most potent agonist followed by (?)then (+)-norephedrine. the reatest activity was observed at the al-receptor, with little
activity observed at either
or p2-adrenoceptors. reserpinization shifted the (-)norephedrine dose-response curve slighty to the right, indicating that only a minor portion
of its activity is due to the release of stored endogenous catecholamines. these results
suggest that most of the cardiovascular activity of the compounds is through the direct
activation of al-adrenoceptors.

(?)-norephedrine
(phenylpropanolamine)
is
present in many cough, cold and antiallergy
products and appetite suppressants (hoebel &
hernandez 1978). the racemate has been shown to
exert mixed actions on adrenergic receptors, producing indirect and direct effects, depending on the site
and the dose of the drug (nickerson & nomaguchi
1953; trendelenburg et a1 1962a, b). more recent
reports have demonstrated that the drug binds to
al-adrenoceptors, but with low affinity and low
intrinsic activity (minneman et a1 1983). those
investigators concluded that it acts as a partial
agonist at the al-adrenoceptor. maher et a1 (1985)
reported it to be largely a direct acting agonist on the
cardiovascular system of the anaesthetized rat;
moreover, pentel et a1 (1985) were unsure whether
(*)-norephedrine had any p,-adrenoceptor activity.
because of the confusion and of the clinical
importance of the drug, we have investigated the
cardiovascular profiles of the racemate and its
isomers to see if they are directly or indirectly acting
compounds, and which subtypes of adrenoceptors
are stimulated in the cardiovascular system of the
pithed rat.
methods

norrnotensive male albino sprague-dawley rats (n
= 130), 200-400 g, (charles river breeding laboratories, wilmington, ma), were housed individually
in our facilities. animals were acclimatized to the
facilities for one week before experimentation. on

* correspondence.

the day of the experiment animals were anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a
mixture of 500 mg kg-1 urethane and 50 mg kg-1
alpha-chloralose. the trachea, left carotid artery and
right jugular vein were cannulated and rectal temperature was maintained at 37 "c.the animals were
then pithed by inserting a steel rod into the spinal
canal. immediately following pithing the tracheal
cannula was attached to a harvard apparatus dual
phase control respirator pump (model 613) and the
animal artificially ventilated at a frequency of 1hz
with air in a volume of 2 muloo g of body weight.
systemic arterial blood pressure and heart rate were
measured from the left carotid artery with a statham
p23 pressure transducer and recorded on a grass
model 7d polygraph. the right jugular vein was
cannulated for intravenous (i.v.) administration of
the test compounds and pharmacological antagonists
in a volume of 0.5 ml kg-1 and 1ml kg-1, respectively; phenoxybenzamine, the only exception, was
given in a volume of 2 ml kg-1. the preparation was
allowed to equilibrate for at least 30 min before drug
administration. all pressor responses were
expressed as the change in mean arterial pressure
(map) in mmhg. in the part of the study
requiring catecholamine depletion to investigate
direct vs indirect activity (a,pi, p2 responses), each
rat was pretreated with reserpine ( 5 mg kg-1, i.p.)
24 h before experimentation. this treatment abolished the pressor response to 5 mg kg-1 i.v. of the
indirectly acting sympathomimetic, tyramine (data
not shown). all other drug pretreatments were
acute, at the doses indicated, and given 1 5 d n
before the study (ruffolo & yaden 1983).

norephedrine and adrenoceptors

for the vasodepressor activity (p,-activity) the
above procedure was followed with the addition of
cannulation of the left jugular vein for constant
infusion of angiotensin i1 (150 ng kg-1 min-1) with a
harvard apparatus infusion pump (model 940).
after a 15 min equilibration, angiotensin i1 infusion
was begun to elevate mean systolic blood pressure to
50 5 mmhg from the resting value. phenoxybenzamine (3 mg kg-1 i.v.) was administered followed
15 min later by yohimbine (lmgkg-1 i.v.), to
antagonize completely vascular a-adrenoceptor
vasoconstriction which could interfere with the
vasodepressor response. once the pressor response
was stabilized (within 10 min), the vasodepressor
effects (ruffolo et all984; ruffolo & yaden 1983) of
i.v. administered racemate and isomers were investigated. drug-induced decreases in map were used as
an index of p-activity.
the p1-positive chronotropic responses to the drug
were evaluated by pretreating animals with phenoxybenzamine (3 mg kg-1 i.v.) and yohimbine
(1 mg kg-1
i.v.).
because myocardial p2adrenoceptors are now known (carlsson et a1 1972;
broadley 1982; brodde et al 1983) and could
interfere with the quantitation of p-adrenoceptormediated chronotropic activity, the animals were
also pretreated with the selective p2-adrenoceptor
antagonist ici 118,551 (ruffolo & morgan 1984).
all results are expressed as map k s.e.m. (n =
4-6 per group). cumulative dose-response curves
are drawn by linear regression and tested, wherever
possible, for deviations from linearity by analysis of
variance in regression (difazio 1984; wallenstein et
a1 1980). slopes of the different cumulative dose-

+

response curves were compared by test of parallelism
(tallarida & murray 1981).
drugs
drugs were prepared daily in 0.9% nacl (saline) or
for phenoxybenzamine, propranolol,  xxxd3000xxx ,
yohimbine and ici 118,551 in distilled, deionized
water. reserpine was prepared in dimethylsulphoxide (dmso). yohimbine hci, reserpine hc1 and
angiotensin i1 were from sigma chemical co. (st
louis, mo).  xxxd3000xxx  hc1 was a gift from pfizer inc.
(new york, ny); phenoxybenzamine from smith
kline and french laboratories (philadelphia, pa);
ici 118,551 ( xxxd2033xxx -~~-l-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)3-isopropylaminobutan-2-01) from imperial chemical industries (cheshire, uk); (+)-norephedrine
hci was from aldrich chemical co. and (+)norephedrine hci (phenylpropanolamine) and (-)norephedrine hci were from rhoer chemical inc.
(long island city, ny). the identity of the norephedrine compounds was established before use.
results

the pressor responses of (+)-, (+)- and (-)norephedrine were evaluated in pithed rats pretreated
with propranolol (3mgkg-1 i.v.). both (-)- and
(+)-norephedrine when administered were potent
pressor agents capable of elevating map by approximately 95 10 and 70 k 8 mmhg, respectively, at
the highest dose tested (all responses are presented
as changes in map; diastolic and systolic changes
were identical in regard to significance in every
case). the (+)-isomer only elevated map 19
5 mmhg at the highest dose tested (10 mg kg-1). the

pressor effects of (?)- and (+)-norephedrine were
not significantly affected (p > 0.05) by 24 h pretreatment with reserpine (5 mg kg-1 i.p., fig. l b , d),
suggesting that the vasoconstriction was mediated by
direct activation of postsynaptic vascular a-adrenoceptors. however, the (-)-norephedrine pressor
response was significantly affected by reserpine
pretreatment (p < 0.05; fig. 1c) suggesting that it
acts in part as a mixed agonist.
pressor responses elicited by an a-adrenoceptor
agonist in pithed rats may result from activation of a
mixed population of postsynaptic vascular al-and/or
a2-adrenoceptors (timmermans et a1 1979; langer
& massingham 1980). the pressor responses of the
compounds were therefore evaluated after pretreatment of the preparation with propranolol and with

either the al-adrenoceptor selective antagonist  xxxd3000xxx  (0.1 mg kg-1 i.v.) or the a*-selective antagonist
yohimbine (1mg kg-1 i.v.) to establish the contribution made by each adrenoceptor subtype to the
pressor response observed in fig. 1a. these doses of
 xxxd3000xxx  and yohimbine produce relatively selective
antagonism of postsynaptic vascular al-and a2adrenoceptors, respectively, with little crossover
between the a-adrenoceptor subtypes (ruffolo &
yaden 1983; ruffolo & morgan 1984).
the results of selective antagonism by  xxxd3000xxx  or
yohimbine on the pressor response to the racemate
and isomer are presented in figs 2 and 3. the rank
order of potency was: (-)- > (?)- > (+)norephedrine. the pressor responses were mediated

norephedrine and adrenoceptors

adrenoceptors as evidenced by the fact that their
respective vasopressor effects (figs 2, 3) were
antagonized by  xxxd3000xxx  and only to a lesser extent
by yohimbine.
the pl-adrenoceptor-mediatedeffects were investigated by measuring chronotropic responses in
pithed rats pretreated with phenoxybenzamine,
yohimbine and the selective p2-adrenoceptor antagonist ici 118,551 (bilski et a1 1983) at 5 mg kg-1 i.v.
the pl-positive chronotropic responses are shown in
fig. 4a. the rank order of potency was: (-)- > (+)3 (+)-norephedrine. the positive chronotropic
responses of (+)- and (+)-norephedrine were not
significantly affected (p > 0.05) by 24 h pretreatment with reserpine (5 mg kg-1 i.p., fig. 4b, d),
indicating that the responses were mediated by the
direct activation of pl-adrenoceptors. however, the
p1-response to (-)-norephedrine was significantly
affected by reserpine pretreatment (p < 0.05, fig.
4c), suggesting that it acts as a mixed agonist at the
pl-adrenoceptor as was seen at the a-adrenoceptors.
p2-adrenoceptor-mediatedvasodilation was determined by measuring the decrease in map in pithed
rats during constant angiotensin i1 infusion. the
results indicate that at this adrenoceptor subtype the
depressor responses of racemate and isomers are
very small and the rank order of potency was similar
to that observed at the a-and pl-adrenoceptors (data
not shown).
discussion

the pharmacological profiles of racemate and isomers of norephedrine differ markedly at the a-adrenoceptor subtypes in the cardiovascular system of
the pithed rat. all three compounds were effective
vasoconstrictors capable of mediating dosedependent increases in systolic, diastolic and map,
(-)-norephedrine being the most potent (fig. 1).
the mechanism of the pressor response was similar
for the other compounds. all three compounds
increased map mainly by direct activation of 011adrenoceptors, but a proportion of their activity was
also due to a direct activation of a2-adrenoceptors.
moreover, the pressor response of (-)norephedrine may also be due to an activation of a
mixed population of a-adrenoceptors by direct and
hdirect mechanisms (but largely direct).
the racemate was the most interesting compound.
the direct activation and selectivity of it at a-adrenoceptors is consistent with previous findings
(nickerson & nomaguchi 1953; trendelenburg et a1
1962a, b). an apparent anomaly exists as it does not
have any observed indirect activity at the p1-

adrenoceptor subtype as reported by carlsson et a1
(1972). moreover, since the (-)-isomer has some
minor indirect activity, the possibility of some
undetected non-significant indirect activity by the
racemate cannot be ruled out. all three compounds
possess the ability to lower blood pressure in
reserpine-, phenoxybenzamine- and yohimbinepretreated pithed rats with increased vascular tone
induced by a constant infusion of angiotensin 11.
these depressor responses were relatively small,
similarly, the magnitude of the positive chronotropic
response for all the compounds was small but,
greater than that seen at the p2-adrenoceptors.
therefore, their differential effects on the cardiovascular system of the pithed rat may be preferably
explained by differences in their potencies at a-adrenoceptors, mainly the al-subtype.
it should be mentioned that ether or
 xxxd2279xxx -sodium are the most appropriate
anaesthetic agents in pithed animals because they are
more superficial and shorter acting. we used a
mixture of urethane-chloralose which is longer acting
and possesses some cardiodepressant activity but it is
nonetheless commonly used (conlay et a1 1981).
additionally, we chose chloralose and urethane
because we planned to compare cardiovascular
profiles of these compounds in pithed and nonpithed rats.
in summary, it can be concluded that the three
compounds tested are capable of activating each type
of adrenoceptor studied. the main drug response of
the three compounds was seen at the a]adrenoceptor subtype. the p-response is significantly less than that observed at the a1adrenoceptors. the racemate and (+)-isomer are
direct acting while the (-)-isomer is mixed, but
largely direct acting.
