rankl inhibition in the treatment of bone metastases.  bone metastases are common in patients with advanced malignancies and are associated with skeletal-related events, cancer progression, and death. receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa beta ligand (rankl) and its receptor, rank, key mediators of osteoclast differentiation and function, play a pivotal role in bone destruction induced by metastatic bone tumors. the present review summarizes the contribution of rankl to pathologic bone disease and presents early clinical data on rankl inhibition in human metastatic cancer.
