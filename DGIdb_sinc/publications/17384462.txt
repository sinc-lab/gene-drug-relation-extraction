background it is still unclear whether  xxxd458xxx , abeta1-selective blocker, reduces myocardial infarct size. this
study will examine whether  xxxd458xxx  reduces myocardial infarct size, as well as investigate the mechanisms for
its infarct size-reducing effect in rabbits.
methods and results japanese white rabbits underwent 30 min of ischemia and 48 h of reperfusion.  xxxd458xxx 
(1 or 10 mg·kg–1 ·h–1 for 60 min, iv) was administered 20 min before ischemia with or without pretreatment with
nomega-nitro-l-arginine methylester (l-name, 10 mg/kg, iv, a  xxxd2738xxx  synthase inhibitor) or 5-hydroxydecanoic
acid sodium salt (5-hd, 5 mg/kg, iv, a mitochondrial  xxxg1253xxx  blocker). the area at risk as a percentage of
the left ventricle was determined by using evens blue dye, and the infarct size was determined as a percentage of
the area at risk by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining.  xxxd458xxx  1 and 10 mg·kg–1 ·h–1 significantly reduced
the infarct size in a dose-dependent manner (36.4±1.7%, n=7 and 25.4±2.9%, n=7, respectively) compared with
the control (46.2±3.1%, n=8). the infarct size-reducing effect of  xxxd458xxx  was completely blocked by l-name
(40.4±2.8%, n=8) but not by 5-hd (27.3±1.0%, n=8).  xxxd458xxx  1 mg·kg–1 ·h–1 increased the myocardial interstitial levels of nox, an indicator of  xxxd2738xxx , and reduced the intensity of dihydroetidium staining of myocardium, an indicator of superoxide, during reperfusion after 30 min of ischemia.
conclusion  xxxd458xxx  reduces myocardial infarct size and also increases  xxxd2738xxx  production and reduces
superoxide levels but not mitochondrial katp channels in rabbits. (circ j 2007; 71: 574 – 579)

eta-blockers are currently widely used for the treatment of hypertension, angina pectoris and myocardial infarction. among manybeta-blockers,  xxxd458xxx 
is a selective  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor antagonist with intrinsic
sympathomimetic activity.1  xxxd458xxx  has been reported to
be protective against heart failure in rats2 and reported to
increase coronary blood flow and improve myocardial
ischemia by increasing cardiac  xxxd2738xxx  (no) release in
the ischemic heart in dogs.3 in contrast, it has been reported
that a ischemic preconditioning effect is mediated through
no,4,5 and that exogenous no administered before ischemia
reduces the myocardial infarct size.6,7 therefore, it is hypothesized that  xxxd458xxx  might reduce the myocardial infarct
size because of its ability to produce no.3
in the present study, we examined whether  xxxd458xxx  can
reduce the myocardial infarct size and we also investigated
its mechanism in a rabbit model of myocardial infarction.

study protocol
as shown in fig 1, rabbits were randomly assigned to 7
groups:  xxxd458xxx -1 group ( xxxd458xxx  1 mg·kg–1 ·h–1, n=7),
 xxxd458xxx -10 group ( xxxd458xxx  10 mg· kg–1 · h–1, n=7) lname +  xxxd458xxx  group ( xxxd458xxx  10 mg· kg–1 · h–1 + lname 10 mg/kg, n=8), 5-hd +  xxxd458xxx  group (5-hd
5 mg/kg +  xxxd458xxx  10 mg·kg–1 ·h–1, n=8), l-name group
(l-name 10 mg/kg n=8), 5-hd group (5-hd 5 mg/kg
n=8) and the saline control group (n=8). in the control
group, placebo saline (0.9% nacl, ph 7.4) was infused at a
rate of 8 ml/h starting at 20 min before the 30 min ischemia
insult until 10 min after the reperfusion. the celipolol
groups were identical to the control group except that
 xxxd458xxx  was administered intravenously at a rate of 1 mg·
kg–1 ·h–1 or 10 mg·kg–1 ·h–1 for 60 min instead of saline. the
5-hd +  xxxd458xxx  and l-name +  xxxd458xxx  groups were
identical to the  xxxd458xxx  10 group, except that 5-hd or lcirculation journal vol.71, april 2007

name was injected intravenously 10 min before the start
of the infusion of  xxxd458xxx . the 5-hd and l-name
groups were identical to the control group, except that 5hd or l-name was injected intravenously 10 min before
the start of the infusion of saline. after the treatment, the
coronary artery was occluded for 30 min and reperfused.
hemodynamic parameters were recorded throughout the
experiment until 20 min after reperfusion. then, the chest
was closed and the rabbits were then allowed to recover
from anesthesia. the doses of l-name and 5-hd were
decided according to previous reports.7,8
determination of infarct size
forty-eight hours after reperfusion, the rabbits were reanesthetized, and the hearts were excised. after the coronary artery was reoccluded at the identical position, evans
blue dye was retrogradely infused into the ascending aorta

at 80 mmhg to determine the area at risk. as we left the
string beneath the coronary artery at the occluded site after
reperfusion and closed the chest, it was easy to identify the
location of the previous coronary ligature. the left ventricle
was sectioned into 7 slices parallel to the atrioventricular
ring. each slice was weighed, incubated in a 1% solution of
triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (ttc) at 37°c for 10 min to
visualize the infarct area, and photographed. the areas of
the ischemic region and the infarcted myocardium were
traced on each slice of left ventricle and multiplied by the
weight of the slice, then expressed as a percentage of the
risk region or left ventricle for each heart.
determination of nox
fourteen rabbits were assigned to investigate the effect

of  xxxd458xxx  on myocardial interstitial levels of nox, an
indicator of no. a microdialysis technique was used as
previously reported.7,8 briefly, a microdialysis probe (pnf
1700: ashahi medical, tokyo, japan, 20-mm length, 0.31mm od, 0.2-mm id; transverse type, 50,000 mw cut-off)
for dialysate sampling was implanted in the risk region of
the myocardium, which was served by the anterolateralcoronary artery along the axis of the ventricular fibers and
reached from the epicardial outer layer to the endocardial
inner layer of the myocardium. probe placement was confirmed at autopsy. the microdialysis probe was perfused
with ringer’s solution at a rate of 10mul/min. after a 60-min
rest following the completion of instrumentation, the dialysate was sampled during 3 30-min periods, that is, before
ischemia, during ischemia and during reperfusion with

10 min before ischemia until 20 min after reperfusion. nox
was measured by using a nitrate/nitrite colorimetric
assay kit (cayman chemical).
detection of superoxide production in the heart
ten rabbits were assigned to investigate the effect of
 xxxd458xxx  on the level of superoxide in the myocardium during reperfusion. rabbits were subjected to 30 min ischemia
and 10 min reperfusion with saline (n=5) or  xxxd458xxx 
(1 mg·kg–1 ·h–1, iv, starting at 20 min before ischemia until
10 min after reperfusion, n=5) being present before the heart
was immediately removed and sectioned into 7 transverse
slices parallel to the atrioventricular ring. then, the tissues
were embedded in oct compound (miles scientific) and
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. the oct compounds were
sectioned at 6-mm thickness with a cryostat for detection of
the superoxide levels in situ. dihydroethydium was used to
evaluate the levels of superoxide in situ, as dihydroethidium
reacts with superoxide anions to form ethidiumbromide,
which in turn intercalates with dna to provide nuclear
fluorescence as a marker of superoxide anion generation.9
dihydroethidium (2 mmol/l) was applied to each tissue,
and the slides were incubated in a dark humidified chamber
at 37°c for 20 min. images were obtained with a confocal
microscopy. fluorescence was detected with a 585 nm long
pass filter.
statistical analysis
all values are presented as mean ± se. risk and infarct
size were compared among the groups by 1-way analysis
of variance combined with bonferroni’s post hoc test for
multiple comparisons. the difference in hemodynamics and
nox levels over the time course between the control and
the drug-treated groups was assessed by 2-way repeated
measures analysis of variance. differences with p<0.05
were considered statistically significant.

infarct size
fig 2 shows representative photographs showing evans
blue dye staining and ttc staining in cases of saline control,  xxxd458xxx  1 mg/kg, and  xxxd458xxx  10 mg/kg. the mean
areas at risk as a percentage of left ventricle were: 33.3±1.2,
30.8±2.6, 32.3±1.4, 29.4±2.5, 28.8±2.2, 33.8±1.0, and 29.2±

 xxxd458xxx , 5-hd +  xxxd458xxx , l-name and 5-hd groups,
respectively (fig 3a). no significant difference was seen
among these groups. as shown in fig 3b, the infarct size as
a percentage of the area at risk was significantly reduced in
the  xxxd458xxx -1 group (36.4±1.7%, n=7) and the celiprolol10 group (25.4±2.9, n=7) compared with the saline control
group (46.2±3.1%, n=8). the infarct size-reducing effect
of  xxxd458xxx -10 was completely abolished by pretreatment
with l-name (40.4±2.8%, n=8) but not by 5-hd (27.3±
1.0%, n=8). both l-name and 5-hd alone did not affect
the infarct size (38.6±2.1%, n=8; 43.7±3.2%, n=8; respectively).
myocardial interstitial nox levels
as shown in fig 4, the myocardial interstitial levels of
nox, an indicator of no, were significantly increased
during 30 min of ischemia and 30 min of reperfusion in the
 xxxd458xxx  group as compared to the control group.

superoxide levels in the myocardium
as shown in fig 5, superoxide production in the ischemic
myocardium from the rabbit hearts detected by the intensity of dihydroethidium staining was significantly reduced
in the  xxxd458xxx  group compared with the control group.

discussion
in the present study,  xxxd458xxx  reduced the infarct size
in a dose-dependent manner in a rabbit model of 30 min
ischemia and 48 h reperfusion. the infarct size-reducing
effect of  xxxd458xxx  was completely abolished by a no
synthase (nos) inhibitor, l-name, but not by a mitochondrial  xxxg1253xxx  blocker, 5-hd, suggesting that the
infarct size-reducing effect of  xxxd458xxx  was caused by an
increased production of no and not by the opening the
mitochondrial katp channels.
concerning the mitochondrial katp channels, it has been
reported that ischemic preconditioning, a brief episode of
ischemia and reperfusion, opens the mitochondrial katp
channels and reduces the myocardial infarct size,10 and
pharmacological opening of the mitochondrial  xxxg1253xxx  is protective against ischemia-reperfusion injury.11 as
many pharmacological agents protect the heart via opening
of the mitochondrial katp channels,8,12,13 we first examined
in the present study whether  xxxd458xxx  also reduces the
myocardial infarct size via the opening of the mitochondrial
katp channels. as a result, the infarct size-reducing effect
of  xxxd458xxx  was not affected by the pretreatment with 5hd, a mitochondrial  xxxg1253xxx  blocker, which suggests
that the infarct size-reducing effect of  xxxd458xxx  was not
caused by the opening of the mitochondrial katp channels.
many studies have shown that no has many protective
effects against cardiovascular disease, such as relaxing the
vascular smooth muscle by decreasing free [ca2+i], inhibiting ca2+ influx;14 regulating the endothelial adhesiveness
for monocytes;15,16 inhibiting platelet adhesion and restoring blood flow in the injured artery.17 no has also been
reported to mediate the ischemic preconditioning effect on
the infarct size,4 and reduce the myocardial infarct size.4–6
 xxxd458xxx  is a selectivebeta1-adrenoceptor antagonist, and reported to increase the production of no in the coronary
artery,3 and it has also been reported that  xxxd458xxx  increases
enos by stimulating the  xxxg1743xxx -akt signaling pathway and
improves cardiovascular remodeling.18 therefore, we first
hypothesized that  xxxd458xxx  would reduce the myocardial
infarct size through the production of no. as a matter of
fact, in the present study,  xxxd458xxx  1 mg· kg–1 · h–1 and
10 mg·kg–1 ·h–1 both reduced the myocardial infarct size,
but the infarct size-reducing effect of  xxxd458xxx  10 mg·
kg–1 · h–1 was completely abolished by the pretreatment
with l-name, a nos inhibitor. this suggests that the infarct size-reducing effect of  xxxd458xxx  was caused by the
production of no.
 xxxd458xxx  reduced the infarct size in a dose-dependent
manner. treatment with  xxxd458xxx   xxxd1891xxx  mg·kg–1 ·h–1 decreased the mean blood pressure and heart rate during
ischemia and reperfusion. this means that  xxxd458xxx 
10 mg·kg–1 ·h–1 decreased the oxygen consumption, which
then might have caused the reduction in the infarct size.
however, treatment with 1 mg·kg–1 ·h–1 of  xxxd458xxx  did
not affect hemodynamics such as mean blood pressure or
heart rate. this suggests that the infarct size-reducing effect
of  xxxd458xxx  of 1 mg·kg–1 ·h–1 was caused by other factors
than the decrease in oxygen consumption. as a matter of

fact, the infarct size-reducing effect of  xxxd458xxx  was completely abolished by the pretreatment with l-name, suggesting that the infarct size-reducing effect of  xxxd458xxx  was
caused by the production of no. it has been reported that
because 3mug·kg–1 ·h–1 of propranolol increased neither coronary blood flow nor cardiac no production, and propranolol
doses higher than 3mug·kg–1 ·h–1 also did not increase coronary blood flow, the effect of  xxxd458xxx  to increase blood
flow and no production is independent ofbeta-adrenoceptor
blockade.3 therefore, it is possible that  xxxd458xxx  reduces
the infarct size via a no-dependent mechanism rather than
a change in blood pressure. as a matter of fact, in the
present study, treatment with 1 mg·kg–1 ·h–1 of  xxxd458xxx 
increased the myocardial interstitial nox levels during
30 min of reperfusion. this also confirms that  xxxd458xxx 
increases myocardial no production during reperfusion.
production of oxygen-derived free radicals during reperfusion has been reported to contribute to the ischemiareperfusion injury.19 it has been reported that a beta-blocker
carvedilol inhibits superoxide production in an isolated
rat heart.20 similarly, we found in the present study that
 xxxd458xxx  treatment reduced the intensity of dihydroethidium
staining in the myocardium, suggesting that  xxxd458xxx 
suppressed the production of superoxide in the ischemic
myocardium. this suggests that one of the mechanisms of
 xxxd458xxx  for reducing the myocardial infarct size was
caused by the reduction of superoxide production during reperfusion by  xxxd458xxx  treatment. no has been reported to
have an extremely high affinity for the superoxide radicals
and reacts with superoxide and scavenges the superoxide
produced by reperfusion.21 indeed, in the preset study,
 xxxd458xxx  increased the myocardial levels of nox, an indicator of no, and decreased the intensity of dihydroethydium
staining of the myocardium, suggesting that  xxxd458xxx  enhanced the production of no and decreased the production
of superoxide. these effects of  xxxd458xxx  might have reduced the myocardial infarct size.
the results of the present study might provide new insights into therapeutic strategies with beta-blockers for the
treatment of coronary artery disease.
in conclusion,  xxxd458xxx  reduces myocardial infarct size
and involves no production and reduced superoxide but
does not require the opening of mitochondrial katp channels in rabbits without collateral circulation.
