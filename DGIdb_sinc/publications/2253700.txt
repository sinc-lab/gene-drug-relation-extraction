the goals of the present study were: (1) to investigate the binding properties of (r)- and (s)- xxxd3019xxx  and two
achiral derivatives of muscarinic m~, m 2 and ma receptor subtypes and (2) to identify the interactions which allow
these receptors to discriminate between the two stereoisomers. (r)-proeyclidine showed a higher affinity for human
neuroblastoma nb-ok 1 muscarinic m~ and rat striatum muscarinic m4 receptors, as compared to rat cardiac m 2
receptors. (s)- xxxd3019xxx  had a 130-fold lower affinity than (r)- xxxd3019xxx  for mt and m4 receptors, and a 40-fold
lower affinity for m 2 receptors. pyrrinol, the achiral diphenyl derivative with the cyclohexyl group of (s)- xxxd3019xxx 
replaced by a phenyl group, has an eight-fold lower affinity for mt and m 4 receptors, as compared to (r)- xxxd3019xxx , and a three-fold lower affinity for m 2 receptors. hexahydro- xxxd3019xxx , the corresponding achiral dicyclohexyl
compound, had a 10- to 20-fold lower affinity than (r)- xxxd3019xxx  for the three receptors.
the increase in binding free energy, which is observed when the phenyl and cyclohexyl groups of  xxxd3019xxx  are
separately replaced by cyclohex2/l and phenyl groups, respectively, was additive in the ease of m t, m 2 and m a
receptors. this indicates that the muscarinic receptor stereoselectivity was based on the coexistence of two binding
sites, one preferring a phenyl rather than cyclohexyl group and the second preferring a cyclohexyl rather than a phenyl
group. in addition, there were also binding sites for the hydroxy moiety and the protonated amino group of the
ligands. the greater affinity and stereoselectivity of m~ and m4 muscarinic receptors for (r)- xxxd3019xxx  reflected the
better fit of the cyclohexyl group of (r)- xxxd3019xxx  to the subsite of mi and m4 as compared to m2 receptors.

tors, with a high affinity for  xxxd2965xxx , are typically found in neuronal tissues ( h a m m e r et al.,

present in cardiac tissue (hammer et al., 1986).
they also show a low affinity for 4-damp and
hhsid (waelbroeek et al., 1987b; 1988; 1989);
(c) m 3 receptors have high affinities for 4-d,~mp
(barlow et al., 1976) and hhsid (mutsehler and
lambrecht, 1984) and low affinities for  xxxd2965xxx  and af-dx 116. they are typically detected
in secretory glands and smooth muscle (waelbroeck et al., 1987a; kore et al., 1987); (d) m 4
receptors are typically found in ng 108-15 cells
(michel et al., 1989) and rat striatum onaelbroeck
et al., 1990). they have low affinities for  xxxd2965xxx  and af, dx 116 but high affinities for
mcthoctramine and hhsid.
we previously demonstrated that receptors
labeled by [3h]-n-methylscopolamine ([3h]nms)
in nb-gk 1 cells (a huanan neurobtastoma cell
line), rat heart, and rat striatum (those receptors
showing slow [3h]nms dissociation) display m 1,
m~ and m 4 selectivities, respectively (waelbroeck
et al., 1986; 1987a,b; 1988; 1989; 1990). we decided to compare these three systems to analyze
the structure-affinity/selectivity relationships of
muscarinie antagonists related to  xxxd3019xxx .
a majority of previous studies comparing the
binding or functional properties of chiral
muscarinic antagonists and agonists used the drugs
a~ racemates. while this is sometimes unavoidable
(for example if the drug raeemizes quickly in
solution), there are important drawbacks in utilizing a racemate rather than the individual enantiomers (see for example: lambrecht and mutschler,
1986; lambrecht et al., 1988; tacke et al., 1986;
1987; 1989; and the series on chirality (pubfished
in trends pharmacol. sci. 7, 1986, 20-24, 60-65,
112-115, 155-158, 200-205, 227-230, 281-301). receptors are indeed asymmetrical macromolecules.
when studying ~be binding or functional properties of a racemic rmxture of compounds, the information bears at best on the eutomer (high-affinity
enantiomer) but the properties are in some cases
affected by the presence of the distomer (low-affinity enantiomer). if the absolute configuration of
the eutomer is not known, it is, for example,
impossible to map the relative positions of receptor 'subsites' recognizing the protonated amino
group and the hydroxyl group of antimusearinics
of the  xxxd3019xxx  type family.

chirality.
the first aim of the present study was to compare the binding properties of (r)- and (s)- xxxd3019xxx  to the three reasonably pure muscarinic
receptor systems at hand. the affinity and stereoselectivity of ivy,, m 2 and m 4 receptors for  xxxd3019xxx  enantiomers proved to be different in
our binding experiments. in order to identify the
interactions responsible for musearinie receptor
stereoselectivity, we extended the binding analysis
to two aehiral compounds structurally related to
(r)- and (s)- xxxd3019xxx : pyrrinol (the diphenyl
derivative) and hexahydro- xxxd3019xxx  (the di~
cyclohexyl derivative). the structures of these
compounds are shown in fig. 1.

2. materials and methods

2.1. human n b - o k 1 neuroblastoma cells

the nb-ok 1 cells were cultured as previously
described (waelbroeck et al., 1988) in rpmi-1640
medium enriched with 10% fetal calf serum, 100
units/ral p-nicillin and 100 t t g / m l streptomycin.
for 1-[n-rr:ethyl-3h]scopolomine methyl chloride
([3h]nms) binding experiments, the cells were
rinsed, detached and centrifuged in 20 mm sodium
phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) containing 150 mm
naci and 1 mm edta, resuspended and homogenized in 20 mm tris/hcl buffer (ph 7.5)

137
enriched with 5 mm mgc12 and stored in liquid
nitrogen until use.

2.2. rat tissue homogenate prepar~ztions
male wistar albino rats (200-250 g) were decapited and the heart and striatum immediately
removed. all following operations were performed
at 4°c.
the heart was rinsed in isotonic  xxxg2020xxx , then
homogenized in 2.5 ml of 20 mm tris/hc1 buffer
(ph 7.5), enriched with 250 mm sucrose, with an
ultraturrax homogenizer (maximal speed for 5 s)
followed by addition of 12.5 ml of the same buffer,
seven up and down strokes with a glass-teflon
homogenizer and filtration on two layers of medical gauze. the resulting homogenate was used
immexiiately or stored in liquid nitrogen until use.
the striatum was homogenized in 2 mi of 20
mm tris/hcl buffer (ph 7.5) enriched with 250
mm sucrose, using a glass-teflon homogenizer
(seven up and down strokes). the resulting homogenate was stored in liquid nitrogen until use and
diluted 20-fold with the same buffer immediately
before the experiment.
the protein concentrations were determined
according to lowry et al. (1951) using bovine
serum albunfin as standard.

the [3h]nms concentration used was i.0 nm, i.e.
two-fold the tracers' k d value to m 2 binding sites.
in rat striatum homogenates, [3h]nms labels
m~ and m4 sites but dissociates faster from m~
receptors (waelbroeck et al., 1986, 1987b, 1988).
we preincubated 80 l~'lof the homogenate (equivalent to about 30/tg protein) in a total volume of
1.2 ml, in the presence of [3h]nms and unlabeled
drugs. a 2 h preincubation period allowed equilibrium binding. we then added 1 /tm atropine
and allowed tracer dissociation for 35 rain before
filtration. this procedure allowed us to investigate
tracer binding to striatum m 4 receptors only
(waelbroeck et al., 1987b; 1988; 1990). the tracer
concentration used in these experiments (0.25 rim)
was equivalent to five4o!d the tracers" kdvalue to
striatum m4 receptors (waelbloeck et al., 1988).
all incubations were terminated by addition of
2 ml of ice-cold filtration buffer (50 mm sodium
phosphate buffer ph 7.4). bound and free tracer
were immediately separated by filtration on gf/c
glass.-fiber filters presoaked overnight in 0.05%
polyethyleneimine. the samples were rinsed three
times with filtration buffer. the filters were then
dried and the bound radioactivity counted by
liquid scintillation. nonspecific [3h]nms binding
was defined as tracer bound in the presence of 1
/tm atropine.

2.3. binding studies

2.4. analysis of binding data

all binding studies were performed at 25 ° c, at
equilibrium, in a 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer
(ph 7.4) enriched with 2 mm mgci2, [3h]nms,
and the indicated unlabeled drug concentrations,
in a total volume of 1.2 ml.
to measure [3h]nms binding to human nbok 1 cell homogenates, we used 80 btl of homegenate, corresponding to about 200/xg protein per
assay. the incubation period was 2 h in the presence of 0.25 nm [3h]nms (this concentration was
equivalent to two-fold the tracers' kd value to m1
receptors).
for incubation with rat heart homogenates, we
used 80 pl of the homogenate, corresponding to
400-500 pg protein per assay. the 2 h incubation
period was sufficient to allow equilibrium binding.

all competition curves were repeated in duplicate, on at least three different preparations. ic5o
values were determined by a computer-aided procedure described by richardson and humrich
(1984), assuming the existence of only one receptor subtype. indeed, experimental data points were
within 3~ of expected values, assuming that the
molecules investigated competed with [3h]nms
for binding to a single site.
k i values were calculated from ic5ovalues using
the cheng and prusoff equation (cheng and
pmsoff. 1973) which assumes competitive inhibition of tracer binding to a single receptor subtype:
the [3h]nms k o value for the three systems
investigated was determined in separate experiments, as described by waelbroeck et al. (1987a,b;

138

1988). the p k i values, mentioned in table 1, corresponded to - l o g k i values.
the standard deviation of plcs0 ( - l o g ics0 )
determinations was always equal to or below 0.1
log unit. repeated determinations of [3h]nms
kd values were within 10% of each other. this
error should be added to errors in ics0 dete~-minations, since [3h]nms k o values were used to
calculate p k i values. we therefore estimated the
standard deviation of p k i values as being of approximately 0,!5 log unit (40% of k i value).
the binding free energy (zig) for the formation
of a !igand-receptor complex is related to i~s affi1~ity const~nt k a by equation (1):
zig = - r t in k~

(1)

zig values were therefore calculated according
to equation (2), using experimentally determined
k i v ~ u e s (k a = ki-l):
zig = - rt in 1/k~

(2)

2.5. materials
[3h]nms (80 to 85 c i / m m o l ) was obtained
from amersham international (bucks, england).
 xxxd247xxx  and polyethyleneimine were from
sigma chemical co. (st louis, mo, u.s.a.), and
g f / c glass-fiber filters from w h a t m a n (maidstone, england). all the others reagents were of
the highest grade available. all antagonists tested
were synthesized in our laboratories: the  xxxd3019xxx  enantiomers were prepared as previously

published (tacke et al., 1986), pyrrinol was
synthesized according to the literature (adamson,
1949) and hexahydro- xxxd3019xxx  was obtained
by catalytic hydrogenation of pyrrinol.

3. results

as shown in fig. 2, the four compounds investigated in this study inhibited [3h]nms binding to the three muscarinic receptors in a manner
consistent with competition for a si ~''~ binding
site (hill coefficients were not signil tntly different from 1).
the affinity of the  xxxd3019xxx  eutomer, (r) xxxd3019xxx , for m1 and m 4 receptors was greater
*.han its affinity for m 2 receptors (table 1 and fig.
2). the  xxxd3019xxx  distomer, (s)- xxxd3019xxx ,
had a similar affinity for the three subtypes (table
1 and fig. 2). as a result, the eudismic index (pk i
(eutomer) - p k i (distomer)) at m 1 and m 4 receptors was greater than that at m 2 receptors
(table 1).
pyrrinol and hexahydro- xxxd3019xxx  had lower
affinities than (r)- xxxd3019xxx , and higher affinities than (s)- xxxd3019xxx , at the three subtypes
(table 1 and fig. 2).
hexahydro- xxxd3019xxx  had the same receptor
selectivity pattern ~ (r)-procyciidine. in contrast,
pyrrinol was almost nonselective (table 1 and fig.
2), as observed for (s)- xxxd3019xxx .

where  xxxg2361xxx , ag'2, ags and ag4 represent the free
energy achievable by an optimal interaction of,
respectively, the hydrophobic phenyl ring of the
ligand with receptor site 1, the cyclobexyl group
with receptor site 2, the hydroxy group with receptor site 3 and the protonated amino group with
receptor site 4. the value of ag should be as
negative as possible to obtain high-affinity binding. factors a, r , y and 8 in equation 3 take into
account the fact that all four groups are not
necessarily simultaneously in optimal position to
interact with receptor sites 1 to 4 (a, r : v and 8
values probably vary between 0 and 1, prgvided
that the corresponding group does not obstruct
binding by steric hindrance).
the protonated amino group of  xxxd3019xxx 
(fig. 3) might conceivably contribute different interactions with the fourth receptor subsite: an
ion-ion interaction (ligand + . . . . . .
-receptor),
an ion-dipole interaction 0igand + . . . . . .
receptor) and a hydrogen bond (n
h . . . . . . xreceptor). the aveiage intrinsic binding energy of
protonated nitrogens was estimated at 11.5 kcalmo1-1 (i.e. 48.1 li-tool-l; andrews, 1986). this
very important conlr'.'bution to drug binding is
compatible with the observation that all muscarinic
antagonists possess a cationic group. ionic interactions per se probably made an important contribution to binding, since the two enantiomers of
the quaternary ammonium derivative  xxxd3019xxx 
(with a permanent charge and no n-h group),
show higher affinities than procycfidine for the
three receptors (unpublished results).
the hydroxy group of (r)- xxxd3019xxx  (fig. 3)
probably forms a hydrogen bond with the third
receptor subsite: desoxyprocyclidine (without an
hydroxy group) showed the same low potency as
(s)-procyciidine (cited by lambrecht and
mutschler, 1986). misplacing the hydroxy group
of, for example, (s)- xxxd3019xxx  might be even
more unfavorable for binding than replacing it
with a hydrogen atom, if the hydrogen bonds
formed with the solvent (water) must be broken to
allow the drug-receptor interaction.
the binding energy of ionic and hydrogen
bonds depends strongly on the distance between
the two atoms considered; furthermore, the orientation of the o-h bond respective to the electron-

rich acceptor atom also affects the hydrogen bond
energy. parameters -y and 8 in equation 3 are
therefore strongly dependent on the relative positions of the nitrogen, oxygen and oh-hydrogen
atoms of the drug considered, relative to subsites 3
and 4 of the receptor.
the phenyl and cyclohexyl groups probably
contribute to the binding energy by two other
types of interactions: (a) hydrophobic interactions, when a uonpolar surface is r~moved from
water and (b) van der waals interactions (dipoledipole, dipole-induced dipole and induced dipoleinduced dipole interactions, brought about by the
close contact between nonbonded atoms or molecules). the hydrophobic interactions of the phenyl
and cyclohexyl groups with receptor sites 1 and 2,
respectively, are somewhat more independent than
van der waals interactions on the exact position
of the two ring systems, relative to sites 1 and 2.
therefore, substituting the cyclohexyl and phenyl
groups o f the muscarinic antagonist in hydrophobic receptor siges 1 and 2 might be less unfavorable than suppressing the interaction of the
hydroxy or ammonium groups of the antagonist
with their respective receptor subsites 3 and 4. to
test this hypothesis, we investigated the binding
properties of two achiral molecules, in which the
phenyl or cyclohexyl groups of (r)-procycfidine
were replaced by a cyclohexyl or phenyl group.
we assumed that increases in binding free energy,
due to the loss of van der waals interactions with
receptor sites 1 and 2, should be additive provided
that the ammonium and hydroxy groups of the 4
ligands retain their normal binding position (fig.
3). this was indeed observed experimentally: the
differences of binding free energies of (r)- xxxd3019xxx  --* pyrrinol and (r)- xxxd3019xxx  -~
hexahydro- xxxd3019xxx  were small, suggesting that
sterie hindrance did not prevent the interaction of
the (larger) cyclohexyl group with the phenyl-preferring subsite (site 1). they were additive at m~,
m z and m4 receptors (table 2). the stereoselectivity of these three receptors for  xxxd3019xxx  binding apparent!y reflected poor interactiov.s of the
phenyl group at the cyclohexyl binding site and
vice versa.
our results also gave valuable information concernmg the preferential binding of (r)-procycli-
