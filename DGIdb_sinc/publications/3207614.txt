summary

the effects of zinc sulphate and  xxxd269xxx  on 5a-reductase activity in human skin were studied
using an in vitro assay with i,2[^h]-testosterone as substrate. when added at concentrations of
3 or 9 mmol/lj zinc was a potent inhibitor of 5a-reductase activity. at high concentrations, zinc
could completely inhibit the enzyme activity.  xxxd269xxx  was also a potent inhibitor of 5areductase; inhibition was detectable at concentrations as low as 0-2 mmol/1 and was complete at
3 mmol/l. an additive effect of the two inhibitors was observed.  xxxd3049xxx  potentiated the
inhibitory effect of zinc, but not of  xxxd269xxx , suggesting that two different mechanisms are
involved. when the three substances were added together at very low concentrations which had
been shown to be ineffective alone, 90% inhibition of 5a-reductase activity was obtained. if this
inhibition is confirmed in vivo, zinc sulphate combined with  xxxd269xxx  could be an effective
agent in the treatment of androgen related pathology of human skin.

skin is a target tissue for androgens and, as a result, increased androgen activity is accompanied
by a well-defined skin pathology including hyperseborrhoea, acne and hirsutism or alopecia. in
skin, as in many other target tissues, the reduction of testosterone to dihydro-testosterone
(dht) by the enzyme 5a-reductase is the most important of the enzymatic processes involved
in androgen activity; indeed dht is a more potent androgen than is testosterone, due to its
greater affinity for the  xxxg183xxx . the active dht is formed at the target cell site and
the enzyme 5a-reductase, therefore, acts as an amplifier of the androgen signal.' dht is
generally considered responsible for the stimulation ofthe sebaceous gland^ and increased local
formation of dht has been documented in acne^ and in hirsutism.* any product capable of
limiting local dht production could represent, therefore, a potential therapeutic agent. the
trace element zinc has been used in dermatology from the times of the ancient egyptians; only
more recently has it been shown to reduce sebum secretion.^ in addition it is involved in
numerous enzyme systems* and has been reported to play a regulatory role in testosterone

metabolism in the human prostate gland. ^ we have previously shown that zinc can inhibit, in
vitro, the 5a-reductase of human skin.* also, topical application of  xxxd269xxx  has been reported
to have beneficial effects on acne vulgaris.' in the present study we have examined the in vitro
effects of zinc and  xxxd269xxx  on testosterone metabolism and in particular, on 5a-reductase
activity.
methods

materials
i,2[-'h]-testosterone (specific activity 60 mci/mmol), [^'^c]-testosterone (specific activity 60
mci/mmol), ['*c]-dihydrotestosterone (specific activity 58 mci/mmol) and [''^c]-a4-androstenedione (specific activity 57 mci/mmol) were obtained from amersham, france and purified
on celite columns before use. [^*c]-androstanediols (3a and 3)3 adiols) were prepared by
sodium borohydrate reduction of ['''^c]-dht as previously described.'" unlabelled steroids
were purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo, u.s.a) and crystallized in methanol before use.
stock solutions (10 mmol/1) were prepared in ethanol and stored at 4°c. nadph was obtained
from boehringer mannheim, france s.a. (meylan) and diluted in buffer before use. all
solvents and reagents were of analytical grade. zinc sulphate,  xxxd269xxx  and pyridoxine
( xxxd3049xxx ) were kindly provided by the laboratoires bailleul.
tissue preparation
foreskins from normal children (2-3 months old) undergoing circumcision were obtained, with
informed consent from the parents, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at — 8o°c. they
were then homogenized with a polytron homogenizer (five ios strokes) in ice-cold krebsringer phosphate buffer (120 mmol/1 nacl, 48 mmol/1 kcl, 2-6 mmol/1 caclj, 12 mmol/1
4), ph 64 and used as a source of 5a-reductase.
enzymatic assays
the assay for 5a-reductase activity in human skin homogenates has been reported previously.''
increasing concentrations of [^h]-testosterone (9,10,15, 20, 30, 50, 100 and 500 nmol/1) were
evaporated in glass tubes and nadph (2-4 mmol/1) diluted in buffer was added; the reaction
was initiated by the addition of an amount of homogenate corresponding to 10 mg of tissue and
the volume adjusted to i ml with buffer. incubations were carried out in a dubnoff metabolic
incubator at 37°c for periods of 5 to 30 min and stopped by the rapid addition of 10 ml of ethyl
acetate/cyclohexane i: i (v/v). after addition of ["^c]-steroids to monitor recovery and
unlabelled tracers for easy visualization, the steroids were extracted and evaporated to dryness.
tubes without homogenates, but containing the same amount of substrate, buffer and cofactors were always incubated in parallel to determine blank values. the metabolites were
separated by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel, in chloroform/methanol 975:25 (v/v).
testosterone and a4-androstenedione were visualized under uv light (240 nm) and 5areduced steroids using iodine vapour. steroids were scraped from the plate and eluted in ethanol
and acetone. 3 a- and 3j?-adiols, not separated in this system, were eluted together. samples were
counted in a packard 300 c liquid scintillation spectrometer with an efficiency of 68% for ['*c]
and 30% for [^h]. after correction for recovery and deduction of blank values, 5a-reductase
activity was expressed as fmol (dht -i- adiols)/h/mg of tissue.
effect of zinc and  xxxd269xxx  on jcc-reductase activity
zinc sulphate was added to the incubation tubes at final concentrations of 0-5, 1-5, 3, 9 or

15 mmol/1 diluted in 100 /zl buffer, and the assay was performed as described above.  xxxd269xxx 
was added atfinalconcentrations of o-1,02,05 or 3 mmol/1 diluted in 10 /il ethanol. the same
amount of ethanol was also added to the control tubes. in some experiments, pyridoxin (vitamin
b6) at a final concentration of 0-025% was also added to the incubation medium. these
compounds were added separately or together in various concentrations in order to determine
the minimal concentrations which gave a maximal inhibitory effect.
results

preliminary experiments have shown that incubation for 5 min gave good estimates ofthe initial
velocity of the reaction for substrate concentrations as low as 10 nmol/1 (data not shown). we
have used 20 nmol/1 testosterone and 5 min incubations to study the effects of zinc and  xxxd269xxx 
acid on 5a-reductase activity.
effect of zinc and  xxxd269xxx  on jcc-reductase activity
the effects of increasing concentrations of zinc sulphate (1-5 to 15 mmol/1) and  xxxd269xxx  (o-i
to 3 mmol/1) on 5a-reductase activity were studied separately and the results are shown in figure
i. in both cases, there was a dose-dependent inhibition ofthe enzyme activity; 98% inhibition
was observed with 15 mmol/1 zns04 and with 3 mmol/1  xxxd269xxx . when the two compounds
were added together to the incubation medium at concentrations expected to give 50-60%
inhibition (3 mmol/1 and 05 mmol/1, respectively), 95% inhibition was observed (data not
shown).
effect of  xxxd3049xxx  on zinc and  xxxd269xxx  inhibition of ^(x-reductase activity
the addition of  xxxd3049xxx  (o 025%) to zinc sulphate (15 or 3 mmol/1) resulted in a two-fold
increase in the inhibition ofthe enzyme activity (fig. 2a). in contrast,  xxxd3049xxx  had no effect
on 5a-reductase activity when added alone or together with  xxxd269xxx  (fig. 2b). these results
suggest that zinc and  xxxd269xxx  might inhibit 5a-reductase activity through two different
mechanisms.

effect of simultaneous addition of zinc,  xxxd269xxx  and  xxxd3049xxx  at low concentrations

the additive effect of the three compounds was studied in order to determine minimal
concentrations which would effectively inhibit 5a-reductase activity. from the present results,
the concentrations used (0025%  xxxd3049xxx , 05 mmol/1 znso4 and 0 1 mmol/1  xxxd269xxx )
were expected to have a minimal effect, or no effect at all, on the enzyme activity.  xxxd3049xxx 
o 025% and  xxxd269xxx  at o-1 mmol/1 had no effect on the enzyme activity while znso4 at 05
mmol/1 gave less than 30% inhibition (fig. 3). in contrast, when all three compounds were
added together at these concentrations, 90% inhibition of 5a-reductase activity is observed
(fig. 3)discussion

several previous studies' have established the inhibitory action of zinc on the 5a-reductase of
human prostate.^'^^''^ we have shown previously that zinc has an inhibitory effect on 5areductase in human skin.^ the present study confirms this effect. in addition, since topical
 xxxd269xxx  has been reported to have beneficial effects in acne vulgaris,'* we studied the effects
of  xxxd269xxx  on 5a-reductase activity. the results have shown that  xxxd269xxx  is a potent in
vitro inhibitor of this enzyme in skin homogenates.
the' use of w vitro assays to evaluate the local anti-androgenic action of potential 5a-reductase
inhibitors has been reported previously in the study of the inhibitory effect of progesterone. •' •' ^
the main interest of these studies is that they enable the distinction to be made between a local
and a systemic effect of the inhibitor. they are of particular value when the inhibitor can be
applied topically, as is the case with zinc and  xxxd269xxx , and therefore is less likely to exert
systemic effects.
the purpose of the present study was to investigate 5a-reductase inhibition with a view to
eventual application in physiological or pathological situations. as plasma testosterone levels
vary from 2 nmol/1 (women) to 20 nmol/1 (men), it appeared pertinent to study zinc and  xxxd269xxx 
acid inhibition of 5a-reductase activity at this range of substrate concentrations under
conditions which allow a precise measurement of enzyme kinetics.

we have demonstrated a very large inhibition of 5a-reductase activity in the presence of
znso4 at concentrations of 3 to 15 mmol/1; 98% inhibition was obtained with the highest
concentration. in the human prostate, physiological concentrations of zinc are about 02 mmol/1
and no correlation has been found between zinc concentration and 5a-reductase activity.'^
however, a biphasic effect of zinc on 5a-reductase activity in the human prostate has been
reported, with potentiation at low concentrations (01 /imol/1) and inhibition at higher
concentrations (3 to 300 mmol/1).' this inhibition was shown to be non-competitive relative to
testosterone, but competitive relative to nadph formation. our preliminary studies (data not
shown) seemed to indicate that zinc at low concentrations (05 to 3 mmol/1) competitively
inhibits 5a-reductase activity while at higher concentrations (3 to 15 mmol/1) it acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor. these results suggest that zinc at different concentrations may act by
different mechanisms and that this metal ion interferes with different enzymes, since it also
inhibits nadp reduction.
dicarboxylic acids containing 8 to 13 carbon atoms undergo ^-oxidation and have been shown
to be potent inhibitors of oxydoreductases. it has been proposed that  xxxd269xxx  could
competitively occupy the nadph-binding site of 5a-reductase thus resulting in inhibition of
the enzyme.'* in our experiments,  xxxd269xxx  was a potent inhibitor of 5a-reductase activity.
when zinc and  xxxd269xxx  were added together, the effect of these two inhibitors was additive
suggesting that they may act by two different mechanisms.
pyridoxin ( xxxd3049xxx ) is known to interfere with fat metabolism in the skin and, therefore, to
play a role, like the androgens, in the regulation of sebum excretion.'* it improves acne lesions
in adolescents'^ and is more active on topical than on systemic administration.'* this led us to

632
d.stamatiadis, marie-claire bulteau-portois and irene mowszowicz
examine the combined effects of  xxxd3049xxx  and zinc. interestingly, wbereas  xxxd3049xxx  alone
had no effect on 5a-reductase activity of human skin it strongly potentiated the inhibitory effect
on zinc. in contrast,  xxxd3049xxx  did not potentiate the inhibition of 5a-reductase by  xxxd269xxx .
this further supports the hypothesis that zinc and  xxxd269xxx  act by two different mechanisms.
when tbe three substances were tested together, 90% inhibition of tbe enzyme was obtained
at very low concentrations wbich barely had any effect when tested separately.
if this inhibition is confirmed in vivo, a combination of these substances could provide an
effective topical treatment for androgen related pathology of human skin.
