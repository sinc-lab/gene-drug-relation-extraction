dexfenfluramine-associated changes in 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter expression and development of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension in rats.  the appetite suppressant dexfenfluramine, which inhibits neuronal 5-ht uptake and elevates plasma 5-ht levels, has been associated with an increase in the relative risk of developing primary pulmonary hypertension. 5-ht is a mitogen for pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (pa-smcs), an effect that depends upon activity of the 5-ht transporter ( xxxg2150xxx ). to investigate the relationship between dexfenfluramine and pulmonary hypertension, we examined 1) the effect of dexfenfluramine on 5-ht uptake by pa-smcs and the mitogenic response of these cells to 5-ht, and 2)  xxxg2150xxx  mrna in lung tissue from normoxic and chronically hypoxic rats during and at discontinuation of a 4-week dexfenfluramine treatment (2 mg/kg/day). in cultured pa-smcs, dexfenfluramine (10(-6) m) markedly reduced [3h]5-ht uptake and [3h]thymidine incorporation in response to 5-ht (10(-6) m). in lungs from rats exposed to 4-week hypoxia (10% o(2)),  xxxg2150xxx  mrna levels were higher than in normoxic rats (233.5 +/- 22.5 versus 121.8 +/- 4.8 amol/mg of rna, p < 0.05), but were not affected by concomitant treatment with dexfenfluramine. one week after discontinuation of dexfenfluramine,  xxxg2150xxx  mrna levels increased substantially, this effect being additive with that of hypoxia (364.0 +/- 13.1 in hypoxic versus 164.2 +/- 10 amol/mg of rna in normoxic rats). when exposure to 2 weeks of hypoxia followed discontinuation of a 4-week treatment, right ventricular hypertrophy was more severe and muscularization of distal pulmonary arteries more marked (p < 0.01) than in rats pretreated with the vehicle. these data show that, in rats, the increased  xxxg2150xxx  expression that follows dexfenfluramine discontinuation promotes the development of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension.
