 xxxd147xxx  (ag) is a first-generation aromatase inhibitor used for estrogen-dependent breast
cancer. unfortunately, its use has also been associated with agranulocytosis. we have investigated the
metabolism of ag by myeloperoxidase (mpo) and the formation of an mpo protein free radical. we
hypothesized that ag oxidation by mpo/h2o2 would produce an ag cation radical that, in the absence
of a biochemical reductant, would lead to the oxidation of mpo. we utilized a novel anti-dmpo antibody
to detect dmpo (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline n-oxide) covalently bound to protein, which forms only by
the reaction of dmpo with a protein free radical. we found that ag metabolism by mpo/h2o2 induced
the formation of dmpo-mpo, which was inhibited by mpo inhibitors and ascorbate.  xxxd2214xxx , a
congener of ag that lacks the aromatic amine, did not cause dmpo-mpo formation, indicating the
necessity of oxidation of the aniline moiety in ag. when analyzed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy,
we detected a phenyl radical adduct, derived from ag, which may be involved in the free radical formation
on mpo. furthermore, we also found protein-dmpo adducts in mpo-containing, intact human
 xxxg1785xxx  cells (hl-60). mpo was affinity-purified from hl-60 cells treated with ag/
h2o2 and was found to contain dmpo. these findings were also supported by the detection of protein
free radicals with electron spin resonance in the cellular cytosolic lysate. the formation of an mpo
protein free radical is believed to be mediated by one of two free radical drug metabolites of ag, one
of which was characterized by spin trapping with 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane. these results are the first
demonstration of mpo free-radical detection by the anti-dmpo antibody that results from drug oxidation.
we propose that drug-dependent free radical formation on mpo may play a role in the origin of
agranulocytosis.
introduction
 xxxd147xxx  ( xxxd147xxx ,  xxxg2361xxx ) is a first-generation
aromatase inhibitor used for estrogen-dependent breast cancer
therapy or adrenal tumor suppression (1). aromatase is a
cytochrome p450 enzyme that hydroxylates androstenedione to
form estrogen. recent studies have shown that ag improves
the outcome of prostate cancer patients (2). an idiosyncratic
adverse drug reaction with ag use is agranulocytosis, a
condition characterized by severe neutropenia where the absolute
neutrophil count decreases below 1500/mm3 (3-5). this condition greatly increases the risk of bacterial infection. in a case
report, a breast cancer patient died from septicemia associated
with ag-induced agranulocytosis (6). young et al. reviewed
hematologic complications arising from ag clinical trials and
found a 0.9% incidence of neutropenia in 1,345 patients, with
a combined incidence of thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, and
neutropenia of 1.6%. a study in the netherlands between 1974
and 1994 revealed a similar incidence of ag-induced agranulocytosis (7). this incidence is quite similar to the ∼1%
incidence of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (8). the annual
risk of agranulocytosis to the general population has been
reported as 3.4 per million, with 72% of all cases attributed to
pharmaceutical drug use (4).

the mechanism of drug-induced agranulocytosis, however,
is unknown, and there is no suitable screening assay for it
in drug development. because agranulocytosis is an unpredictable event during the course of drug therapy, any insight into
the mechanism of drug-induced agranulocytosis would be
significant.
it has been proposed that neutrophil myeloperoxidase activates xenobiotics to reactive intermediates that mediate further
events to produce an adverse drug reaction (9). arylamine drugs
have been proposed to form n-hydroxylamine metabolites
catalyzed by mixed function oxidases that lead to nitroso
metabolites (9, 10), which are proposed to bind covalently to
proteins that may be involved in agranulocytosis. however, a
free radical metabolite mediating protein radical formation has
not been considered, nor evaluated. the mature neutrophil is
estimated to contain ∼5% myeloperoxidase (mpo) stored within
azurophilic cytosolic granules (11). hl-60 cells derived from
a patient with acute  xxxg1785xxx  also contain similar
amounts of mpo. although the primary role of mpo is
considered to be the formation of bactericidal hypochlorous acid
from chloride and h2o2, this enzyme behaves similarly to other
peroxidases in its metabolism of many organic xenobiotics,
including phenols and anilines (12, 13).
native mpo comprises two heavy (∼59 kda) and two light
(∼14 kda) polypeptide subunits with a weight of ∼150 kda
(14). each heavy-light set (referred to as hemi-mpo) contains
catalytic activity just as the native enzyme does (15). each hemimpo (∼78 kda) is linked via one disulfide bond, and the heavy

scheme 1. postulated mechanisms of arylamine reactive metabolite induced modification of proteins, especially mpoa

a ag metabolism by mpo results in cation radical formation (and in phenyl radical formation) where one or both of these species attacks mpo, resulting
in mpo protein free radical formation. the latter can be trapped by dmpo, resulting in a spin adduct that we detect by immunological methods.

and light subunits are also linked by one disulfide bond. the
heme active site is located in each heavy subunit, thus having
two heme active sites per native mpo (16).
ag is an aniline derivative and should be a peroxidase
substrate (12, 17), although this has never been reported. the
first product of ag metabolism by mpo/h2o2 would presumably be a nitrogen-centered cation radical, which decomposes
into a para-substituted phenyl radical. we hypothesize that one
or both of these species attack mpo to form a protein free
radical as outlined in scheme 1. because an immune response
has been associated with certain instances of drug-induced
agranulocytosis, it is possible that protein free radicals may
trigger an autoimmune response against mpo or other neutrophil
proteins. for example,  xxxd3036xxx , an anti-thyroid drug
that has a risk of agranulocytosis, has been shown to result in
the formation of anti-mpo antibodies in patients (18) and in
cats (19).
the crux of our approach to studying drug-induced protein
radical formation is based on an anti-dmpo antibody that was
developed in our laboratory. this antibody has been used for
the detection of protein free radicals on myoglobin (20),
hemoglobin (21),  xxxg1338xxx  (22),  xxxg2320xxx  (23),
and catalase (24). this spin-immuno assay (see (25) for a
review) allows the detection of protein free radicals with onethousandth the protein required by electron spin resonance (esr)
spectroscopy investigations. herein we show that ag induced
the formation of a protein free radical on mpo and demonstrate
the detection of protein-dmpo adducts from intact hl-60
cells. also, we have identified an ag free radical metabolite
produced from metabolism by mpo/h2o2 that we believe
mediated the protein radical formation on mpo.

experimental procedures
chemicals. human mpo and 4-aminobenzoic acid  xxxd2396xxx 
(abah) were purchased from calbiochem (san diego, ca). mpo
was dissolved in 0.1 m phosphate buffer at ph 7.4 and dialyzed
overnight against the same buffer with slide-a-lyzer dialysis
cassettes (10,000 mwco; pierce biotechnology, rockford, il),
and its concentration was determined by its extinction coefficient
of 178 mm-1 cm-1 at 429 nm (26). ag was purchased from mp
biomedicals (solon, oh). diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid
(dtpa), 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane (mnp),  xxxd2620xxx , and
methyl r-d-mannopyranoside were purchased from sigma chemical
co. (st. louis, mo). the latter was dissolved in methanol, heated
at 37 °c until blue, and wrapped in foil to prevent photodecomposition. 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline n-oxide (dmpo) was purchased
from alexis biochemicals (san diego, ca), purified twice by
vacuum distillation at room temperature, and stored under argon

atmosphere at -80 °c until use.  xxxd2298xxx  (30% v/v,
h2o2) was obtained from fisher scientific co. (fair lawn, nj)
and was assayed by its extinction coefficient of 43.6 m-1 cm-1 at
240 nm (27). chelex-100 resin was purchased from bio-rad
laboratories (hercules, ca).
spectrophotometry. spectrophotometry was performed with a
cary 100 spectrophotometer (varian inc., ca) using a 500 µl
quartz cuvette. reactions were carried out in 0.1 m phosphate buffer
(chelex-100 treated with 100 µm dtpa) at ph 7.4. the spectrophotometer was set to kinetic scan mode, where each scan was
recorded every minute for 60 min. the scan rate was 600 nm/min
between 400 and 500 nm for the measurement of the mpo soret
spectrum. the baseline was derived from the buffer alone. mpo
(500 nm) was added first, followed by ag and/or h2o2. mpo
peroxidase activity was also determined after treatment with ag
20 µm/h2o2 80 µm for 60 min. this solution was diluted 20-fold,
and then 5 mm guaiacol and 100 µm h2o2 were added. the
formation of the guaiacol tetramer was used as a measure of
peroxidase activity (22).
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). elisa
plates (96-well, greiner labortechnik, germany) were used to carry
out the reaction and to detect the dmpo-mpo adduct. the
reactants (final concentrations 100 µm h2o2, 200 µm ag, 100
mm dmpo, and 50 nm mpo) were added to chelex-100-treated
0.1 m phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) containing 100 µm dtpa, mixed,
and 100 µl of this reaction immediately added to the elisa plate
containing 200 µl water. the reaction was carried out for 2 h at
37 °c with mixing at 500 rpm. the plate was washed once with
wash buffer (tris buffered saline, 0.2% coldwater fish gelatin, and
0.05% tween-20 at ph 7.4) and incubated overnight with blocking
buffer (0.1 m nahco3 and 4% coldwater fish gelatin at ph 9.6).
the plate was subsequently washed once, and the anti-dmpo
antibody was added to the plate and incubated for 1 h at 37 °c.
after four washes, the secondary antibody (anti-rabbit igg (fc),
alkaline phosphatase; pierce, il) was added and incubated for 1 h
at 37 °c. after four washes, a chemiluminescent reagent (cdpstar, roche applied science) was diluted to 25 µm in tris-buffered
saline at ph 9.6 and added to the plate. the light emitted was
recorded in arbitrary units using a tecan type genios microplate
reader using xfluor software (tecan us, nc). optimal concentrations were determined by varying the concentrations of ag, h2o2,
dmpo, and mpo one at a time (data not shown).
electron spin resonance (esr). an ag free radical metabolite
was detected by spin trapping (28), where the free radical metabolite
covalently binds to the nitroso spin trap (mnp) to produce a
relatively stable nitroxide adduct. we used mnp for these studies
instead of dmpo because the dmpo nitroxide can be further
oxidized to an esr-silent nitrone product, whereas the mnp
nitroxide cannot be oxidized to a nitrone. reactions were prepared
by adding a final concentration of 25 mm ag and 25 mm mnp
in a 200 µl volume of water to a micro test tube containing 25
µm mpo. reactions were initiated by the addition of 1 mm h2o2
and were briefly vortexed prior to transfer to a quartz esr flat cell

figure 1. ag induces mpo compound ii accumulation. the mpo soret region was recorded once every minute in the absence (a) or presence
(b) of ag for 60 min. in a, resting mpo (500 nm) was recorded first (i), followed by the addition of 80 µm h2o2 (ii). in b, resting mpo (500
nm) was recorded first (i), followed by the addition of 20 µm ag (ii), and finally 80 µm h2o2 (iii). the mpo resting spectrum could be restored
after 60 min by the addition of ascrobate (not shown).

for spectrum recording. esr spectra were obtained with a bruker
emx spectrometer (billerica, ma) equipped with an er 4122 shq
cavity operating at 9.78 ghz and 100 khz modulation field at room
temperature with the following parameters: power ) 20 mw, scan
rate ) 0.47 g/s, modulation amplitude ) 0.4 g, and receiver gain
) 6.32 × 105. spectra were recorded four times (355 s/scan, time
constant ) 327 ms). spectra were simulated using winsim v1.0
software (http://epr.niehs.nih.gov/) running on a desktop pc.
for protein free radical detection, reaction mixtures contained 7
mg of protein/ml of dialyzed hl-60 cell cytosol (see cell culture
below), 1 mm mnp, 1 and 5 mm ag, and 1 mm h2o2, which
was added last to initiate the reaction. inhibitors were added prior
to the addition of ag and preincubated for 5 min. reactions were
premixed in micro test tubes and then transferred to a flat cell for
recording esr spectra. the dialyzed preparation of hl-60 cell
cytosol was prepared by adding ripa buffer (see cell culture) to
5 × 108 cells, followed by homogenization with a dounce
homogenizer. the cytosol was then dialyzed for 72 h with 0.1 m
phosphate buffer in 10 kda cutoff slide-a-lyzer dialysis cassettes
(pierce). the parameters for spectrum recording were identical to
those for ag free radical metabolite detection with the exception
of the modulation amplitude, which was set to 2.5 g.
cell culture. hl-60 cells were maintained in rpmi-1640
medium (invitrogen, gibco #11875119) containing 10% fbs, 31
µg/ml penicillin, 50 µg/ml streptomycin, 10 µl/ml  xxxd164xxx ,
27 mm nahco3, 16 mm hepes, and 8 mm mops in a waterjacketed incubator. cells were centrifuged, washed once, resuspended in rpmi-1640 (no serum) to a concentration of 2 × 106
cells/ml, and plated in 12-well plates (corning inc., corning, ny)
for experiments. dmpo (100 mm) was added 10 min prior to
adding 5 mm glucose and 50 mu/ml glucose oxidase (g/go).
abah (100 µm) was added 30 min prior to initiating the reaction.
other inhibitors, ag, and  xxxd2214xxx  were added 1 min before
initiating the reaction. this concentration initially produced 5 µm
h2o2 per minute but required mixing because the reaction is
oxygen-dependent. at the desired time points, the cells were
centrifuged at 50g for 5 min to remove the supernatant and washed
twice. cell viability was assessed by measuring relative atp levels
using cell-titer glo cell viability assay (promega corp., madison,
wi). the remaining cells were lysed with ripa buffer (0.05 g of
sodium  xxxd1835xxx , 100 µl of triton x-100, and 10 µl of 10%
sds in 10 ml of 0.1 m pbs) containing protease inhibitors
(complete, mini protease inhibitor cocktail tablets, roche applied
science, in). after 30 min, the samples were centrifuged at 20,000g for 20 min. the supernatant (cytosol) was stored at 4 °c until
used for western blots.
western blots. western blots were run under reducing conditions
and were performed as described previously with minor changes
(29). nupage lds 4x lds sample buffer and nupage sample
reducing agent (invitrogen) were added to hl-60 cell cytosol,

heated for 10 min at 70 °c, then loaded on nupage novex 4-12%
bis-tris 1.0 mm gel. after proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, they were blocked for at least 1 h with 4%
gelatin from coldwater fish (sigma) in tris-buffered saline buffer
at ph 7.4 and treated with either anti-dmpo or anti-mpo for
antigen detection. a solution of 250 µm cdp-star and nitro-blockii enhancer (applied biosystems, foster city, ca) in tris-buffered
saline at ph 9.6 was added to the membrane for 5 min before
exposure of the membrane to cl-xposure x-ray film (pierce).
affinity purification of mpo from hl-60 cells. affinity
purification was performed after treatment of the hl-60 cells with
dmpo, g/go, drugs, and inhibitors as described above. a volume
of 5 ml of cells was used to ensure an adequate yield of mpo.
we followed the method of hope et al., which is based on using
 xxxd2620xxx  to bind mpo (which is glycosylated) to separate it
from the protein mixture (30). we first determined from what
fraction mpo was eluted from the  xxxd2620xxx  resin by using
anti-mpo in an elisa, then pooled and concentrated the samples
using centricon centrifugal filter units (100 kda cutoff, millipore
corp., billerica, usa). three to four samples were pooled, which
resulted in a final protein concentration of 1.3-1.6 mg/ml,
determined using the bca protein assay (pierce).

results
mpo compound ii accumulation is induced by ag/
h2o2. as shown in figure 1a, when 80 µm h2o2 was added
to 500 nm mpo, there was a rapid formation of compound ii
(lambda ) 455 nm), followed by a gradual return to the resting
enzyme (lambda ) 429 nm). although compound i is initially formed,
it cannot be detected in conventional spectrophotometry because
of its rapid reduction to compound ii (31). however, in the
presence of 20 µm ag and 80 µm h2o2 (figure 1b), mpo
compound ii accumulated and did not return back to the resting
state. it appears that ag belongs to a class of substrates that
are good substrates for compound i, but poor substrates for
compound ii (17). such substrates have been shown to cause
an inhibition of cl- oxidation, which is carried out only by
mpo compound i. incubation of ag (20-2000 µm) with
mpo/h2o2 did not result in irreversible inhibition of peroxidase
activity as assayed by guaiacol tetramer formation (data not
shown).
esr spectra of an ag-derived phenyl radical metabolite. ag reacted with mpo/h2o2 in the presence of mnp to
produce an esr spectrum consisting of 21 lines arranged in
three sets of seven lines (figure 2a). this spectrum, characteristic of a small, rapidly rotating free radical, is predominantly
the spectrum of an mnp radical adduct of an ag-derived

 xxxd147xxx -induced protein free radicals

figure 2. esr spin trapping of the ag free radical metabolite formed by mpo/h2o2. esr spectra of mpo/h2o2-catalyzed oxidation of ag to
a free radical metabolite. in spectrum a, ag (25 mm) and mnp (25 mm) were added to 200 µl of a solution of 25 µm mpo. the reaction was
performed in deionized water and was initiated by the addition of 1 mm h2o2. esr settings are described in experimental procedures, with the
following changes: modulation amplitude ) 0.4 g and receiver gain ) 2 × 105. spectrum b is a computer-simulated spectrum that closely
matched the actual experimental spectrum (correlation of 0.987). spectrum c was also simulated and shows that the major component consisted of
a 21-line spectrum, in combination with the 3-line spectrum shown in d. controls without ag, h2o2, or mpo did not form this radical adduct (data
not shown). the one-electron oxidation mechanism of ag (e) results in a nitrogen-centered cation free radical which is delocalized into the phenyl
ring. we propose that loss of the amino moiety occurs through loss of hydroxylamine, which is required to form the phenyl radical that we have
unambiguously detected. the hydrogen splitting constants are shown in the radical adduct.

radical. computer simulation of this spectrum produced a close
match (98.7% correlation) to the experimental spectrum in a
(figure 2b). this simulated spectrum consisted of two species.
the first species, shown in figure 2c, contained two hydrogen
hyperfine splitting constants (ah ) 1.91 g and ah ) 0.93 g)
each from two equivalent hydrogens (ah(2) ) ah(6) ) 1.91 g;
ah(3) ) ah(5) ) 0.93 g), and a nitroxide nitrogen (an ) 14.4
g). this species represents the adduct formed between the agderived free radical metabolite and mnp as proposed in figure
2e. controls without ag, h2o2, or mpo failed to form this
radical adduct (data not shown). the second species containing
three sharp lines, shown in figure 2d, contained only a nitrogen
(nitroxide) hyperfine splitting constant (an ) 17.1 g). the latter
has been previously characterized as the photodecomposition
product of mnp (32). even though these reactions were carried
out in the dark as much as possible, some photodecomposition
was unavoidable. therefore, the composite spectrum in figure
2b was a combination of the two spectra shown in figure 2c
and d. a large class of t-butyl-para-phenyl nitroxide radicals
that have been detected in water have two equivalent hyperfine
couplings of about 2 g arising from two ortho hydrogens and
two equivalent hyperfine coupling constants of about 1 g arising
from the two meta hydrogens (33-36). the structure of this
phenyl radical metabolite of  xxxd2214xxx  is unambiguous.
elisa detection of dmpo-mpo adducts and the effect
of an ag congener, mpo inhibitors, and ascorbate. to
test the involvement of the metabolic activation of ag in the
formation of mpo protein free radicals, we used an elisa and
probed for dmpo-mpo using a polyclonal dmpo antibody
developed in our laboratory (20). figure 3 shows that a
significant signal was detected in the reaction system that
contained dmpo, ag, h2o2, and mpo. the absence of ag

resulted in a 10-fold loss of luminescence. formation of the
dmpo-mpo adduct was inhibited by the mpo inhibitors
abah and azide and by the antioxidant ascorbate. if these
inhibitors were added after the completion of the reaction, the
signal was not affected (data not shown). when  xxxd2214xxx ,
which lacks the aniline group, was substituted for ag (the
chemical structures for each are shown), there was no significant
increase in dmpo-mpo, and it was comparable to having no
ag present. the inset shows the concentration dependence of
ag on dmpo-mpo formation. a biphasic pattern is apparent,
with the optimum concentration of ag in this system at 50 µm.
western blot detection of anti-dmpo from intact hl60 cells. to investigate the production of protein-dmpo
adducts in intact hl-60 cells, we incubated 2 × 106 cells/ml
in serum free rpmi-1640 dmpo, ag, and g/go (to generate
h2o2). as shown in figure 4a, this treatment produced bandspecific anti-dmpo staining. molecular weight markers showed
the darkest anti-dmpo staining to occur on a protein between
50 and 75 kda. anti-mpo staining of the same samples showed
that the heavy chain of mpo comigrated with the anti-dmpo
cross-reacting band and that each lane contained approximately
the same amount of mpo (anti-mpo, figure 4a). abah, azide,
ascorbate, and the absence of g/go prevented dmpo-protein
formation. substitution of  xxxd2214xxx  for ag also did not result
in significant dmpo-protein formation.
relative atp levels of these treatments (compared to those
of dmpo treatment alone) were assayed in order to determine
the effect on hl-60 cell atp content: dmpo and g/go (81
( 4.3%); dmpo, g/go, and ag (74 ( 4.5%); + abah
(89 ( 4.7%); + azide (1 ( 0.1%); + ascorbate (44 ( 2.1%);
dmpo and ag (91 ( 5.8%); dmpo, g/go, and  xxxd2214xxx 
(57 ( 2.9%).

but were unsuccessful as such treatments caused the loss of the
esr spectrum because of increased radical adduct decay.

discussion

figure 3. elisa of mpo-dmpo formation catalyzed by ag
metabolism by mpo/h2o2. reactions were performed in chelex-100
treated 0.1 m phosphate buffer, ph 7.4, at 37 c. the incubation of
dmpo (100 mm), h2o2 (100 µm), ag (50 µm), and mpo (50 nm,
added last) resulted in anti-dmpo binding. the presence of abah (1
mm), azide (1 mm), or ascorbate (1 mm) attenuated the signal with
variable efficacy. the absence of ag or its substitution with 50 µm
 xxxd2214xxx  resulted in greatly decreased antibody recognition. mpodmpo detection was carried out using polyclonal anti-dmpo as
described in experimental procedures. the error bars represent (sd
of three wells.

detection of dmpo-mpo from affinity-purified mpo
from hl-60 cells. reactions were carried out as described
above for western blot analysis after affinity purification (figure
4b). only the complete system containing dmpo, g/go, and
ag produced immunoreactivity with anti-dmpo, demonstrating
that dmpo was bound to the mpo heavy chain (∼55kda). a
separate gel of the same samples shows that mpo was present
in each lane in approximately equal amounts.
esr spectra of a protein radical from hl-60 cytosolic
lysate. to support the results of the immunological detection
of a dmpo-mpo adduct as seen with the elisas and western
blots, we recorded esr spectra using a dialyzed preparation of
hl-60 cytosol. reactions contained 1 mm mnp to trap protein
radicals, 1 and 5 mm ag, and 1 mm h2o2, which was added
last to initiate the reaction. dmpo did not give useful spectra
when mpo was present presumably because its nitroxide spin
adducts can be oxidized to the nitrone by peroxidase. therefore,
we chose mnp as a spin trap because, unlike dmpo, its
nitroxide spin adducts are not oxidizable to nitrones. figure 5
shows an ag dose-dependent increase in protein free radical
intensity (figure 5a and b). the broad lined (partially anisotropic) spectrum was indicative of slowly tumbling macromolecule radical adducts (37). the same spectrum was attenuated
in the presence of abah, azide, and ascorbate (figure 5c, d,
and e). the absence of either h2o2 (figure 5f) or ag (figure
5g) resulted in no protein radical formation. the substitution
of  xxxd2214xxx  for ag did not result in significant protein
radical formation. attempts were made to digest or denature
the protein (using pronase, trypsin, and/or urea) in order to
characterize the amino acid residue bearing the radical adduct,

in this study, we have shown that ag metabolism catalyzed
by mpo resulted in the formation of a protein free radical on
mpo, which was then trapped by dmpo and subsequently
identified by a novel anti-dmpo antibody. although the
peroxidation of aromatic amines has been well established, there
have been no previous reports in the literature of the peroxidase
metabolism of ag. we found that ag caused the accumulation
of mpo compound ii. winterbourn et al. (17) have previously
shown that certain nsaids also exhibit this activity, which
resulted in the inhibition of mpo chlorination activity. it is likely
that ag also inhibits chlorination.
the metabolism of ag to a substituted-phenyl radical was
demonstrated by esr using spin trapping with mnp. the phenyl
structure of the mnp adduct is unambiguous (33-36). previously, an almost identical spectrum was found with sulfanilamide after uv photolysis (34). this spectrum was assigned to
4-sulfamoylbenzene-t-butylnitroxide. as sulfanilamide and ag
are both aromatic amines, their free radical chemistry appears
to be similar on the basis of the similarity of their esr spectra.
it has been reported that ammonia evolved in solutions of
sulfanilamide after uv photolysis (38). therefore, on the basis
of the esr spectrum obtained and in combination with the
analogy to sulfanilamide, we conclude that the ag free radical
adduct with mnp results from the cleavage of the n-c bond
of the aniline moiety, with subsequent trapping of the phenyl
radical by mnp to form 3-(4-[t-butylnitroxide]phenyl)-3-ethylpiperidine-2,6-dione (figure 2e). this phenyl radical metabolite
may be responsible for the formation of an mpo protein free
radical by hydrogen abstraction or possibly its addition across
an amino acid double bond. in addition, the parent ag cation
radical will be a strong oxidant with an oxidation potential of
about 1.03 v (39). as such, it may oxidize one or more aromatic
amino acid residues of mpo.
in this study, mpo-catalyzed ag metabolism was immunochemically found to produce a positive response to our antidmpo antibody. to our knowledge, this is the first report of
drug oxidation by a peroxidase/h2o2 system that resulted in a
dmpo-protein adduct, which we propose occurs by the
following reactions (eqs 1-6):

mpo(native) + h2o2 f mpo(compound i) + h2o

(1)

mpo(compound i) + ag f
mpo(compound ii) + ag•+ (2)
ag•+ + -oh f  xxxd2214xxx • + nh2oh

(3)

 xxxd2214xxx  • + mpo f mpo• +  xxxd2214xxx 

(4)

ag•+ + mpo f mpo• + ag

(5)

mpo• + dmpo f mpo-dmpo• f
mpo-dmpo (nitrone) (6)
interestingly, mpo, which itself catalyzed the peroxidation of
the drug, was also the target of the resulting reactive drug
metabolite. because mechanism-based inhibitors of peroxidases

figure 4. (a) western blot of hl-60 cell cytosol after incubation with ag and inhibitors. hl-60 cells (2 × 106/ml, 2 ml) were preincubated with
dmpo (50 nm) for 10 min before the addition of ag. abah (100 µm) was preincubated for 30 min before the addition of dmpo. the reaction
was initiated with 5 mm glucose/50 mu/ml glucose oxidase (g/go), which was added last. the reaction was shaken for 5 min on a plate stirrer
every 30 min and was maintained in a water-jacketed incubator at 37 °c and 5% co2 for 4 h; 10 µg/lane was loaded for anti-dmpo detection, and
1 µg/lane was loaded for anti-mpo. (b) affinity purified mpo from hl-60 cells is bound to dmpo when incubated with ag. hl-60 cell incubations
were carried out as described in a, except with 5 ml of cells in order to obtain sufficient mpo for affinity purification. in the anti-dmpo western
blot, 30 µg of protein was loaded into each lane, but in the anti-mpo western blot, 3 µg of protein was loaded into each lane.

have been proposed to form reactive free radical intermediates
that bind to the heme active site and inhibit enzyme activity
(40-43), we assayed remaining peroxidase activity after incubation with ag. however, we found no inhibition of mpo
peroxidase activity after treatment with ag (data not shown).
the inhibition of anti-dmpo detection when mpo inhibitors
were included in the reaction suggests that mpo catalytic
activity is necessary for mpo protein free radical formation.
abah (42) and azide (43) are both inhibitors of mpo, and
both attenuated dmpo-mpo adduct formation. ascorbate is
a substrate and also a reductant in that mpo/h2o2 can oxidize
ascorbate, but, perhaps more importantly, ascorbate can rapidly
reduce many radical intermediates formed by peroxidases (44).
it is probable that ascorbate inhibited dmpo-mpo nitrone
formation because of its reduction of the ag free radical
metabolites back to the parent molecule, which prevented a
radical attack on mpo. the evidence for the involvement of

the ag cation radical in mpo radical formation was also proven
with the use of  xxxd2214xxx , a congener of ag that lacked the
aromatic amine. the biphasic nature of dmpo-mpo formation
(figure 3, inset) could result from low concentrations of ag
acting as a pro-oxidant and high concentrations of ag acting
as an antioxidant (45, 46).
hl-60 cells were used to investigate whether dmpo-protein
adducts could be detected in intact cells because, similar to
human neutrophils, hl-60 cells contain 47.5 µg mpo/107 cells
(47). neutrophils can be primed by many different agents, all
resulting in the association of the nadph oxidase complex
that produces h2o2 (48). we used g/go to generate h2o2 to
simulate the respiratory burst in neutrophils or macrophages.
the formation of h2o2 as a cosubstrate fueled the peroxidation
of ag by mpo. the model we have used may illustrate a
possible outcome of ag use under a condition of inflammation

it has been proposed, on the basis of liver microsomal
incubations, that an n-hydroxylamine metabolite was responsible
for leucopenia in mice because cimetidine, a cytochrome p450
inhibitor, attenuated the leucopenic effects of ag and inhibited
microsomal protein binding (51). however, skf525a, another
cytochome p450 inhibitor, did not inhibit leucopenia, and
cimetidine itself has been shown to interfere with mpo activity
(52). therefore, n-hydroxylation of ag and subsequent covalent
binding to protein may not be the only mechanism of leucopenia
in mice. we propose that free radical modification of mpo or
other neutrophil proteins (see the high molecular weight smear
in figure 4a) in vivo may lead to anti-neutrophil antibody
formation and granulocyte death via immune-mediated mechanisms.
in summary, we have shown that ag, a drug associated with
a 1% incidence of agranulocytosis, induced the formation of
an mpo free radical in a pure enzymatic system and in hl-60
cells. these findings warrant further study into the toxicological
relevance of an mpo free radical in vivo and the possible role
it may play in the pathogenesis of ag-induced agranulocytosis.

figure 5. esr spectra showing the detection of a protein free radical
from hl-60 cell lysates treated with ag and h2o2. cell lysates were
obtained as described in experimental procedures. the reactions
contained 7 mg/ml of dialyzed lysate, 1 mm mnp (spin trap), variable
concentrations of ag, and 1 mm h2o2 (added last). the reactions were
heated at 37 °c and mixed for 2 min before spectra were recorded.
spectra a and b show an ag dose-dependent increase in protein free
radical intensity. ag (5 mm) was used for the remaining experiments.
the spectrum was attenuated in the presence of 1 mm abah (c), 25
mm azide (d), 1 mm ascorbate (e), and when either h2o2 (f) or ag
(g) was omitted from the reaction. ascorbate produced an intense
ascorbyl radical. when 5 mm  xxxd2214xxx  (h) was substituted for ag,
there was no significant protein radical spectrum recorded. esr settings
are described in experimental procedures.

because neutrophils and macrophages both produce h2o2 during
infection.
in addition to the immunological detection of protein-dmpo
in hl-60 cells formed from ag metabolism, the esr spectra
of hl-60 cell cytosol unequivocally showed the presence of a
protein free radical that was ag-dependent and attenuated in
both systems with mpo inhibitors, further validating its
immunological detection. however, these esr experiments
could not provide information regarding the identity of the
protein target. the western blot from hl-60 cell cytosol
indicated a dmpo-containing band of between 50 and 75 kda,
which led us to consider that the target may be the heavy chain
of mpo whose molecular weight has been reported from 55 to
62 kda (15, 47, 49, 50). through the use of  xxxd2620xxx ,
an affinity purification resin for glycoproteins, we were able to
partially purify mpo from the hl-60 cells and detect dmpo
binding induced by ag.
we propose that the free radical chemistry of ag may be
implicated in agranulocytosis. female albino mice treated with
ag (50 mg/kg/day for 21 days) were found to display a
statistically lower leukocyte count (leucopenia), which included
low neutrophil counts, compared to that of the control (51). this
study also found no such blood dyscrasias using  xxxd2214xxx ,
the ag congener that lacked the phenylic amine. correspondingly, we did not detect an mpo radical with  xxxd2214xxx ,
leading us to hypothesize that ag-induced mpo free radical
formation may be involved in leucopenia and/or agranulocytosis.
