abstract
 xxxd3264xxx  is a potent inhibitor of  xxxg1710xxx ,  xxxg1274xxx ,  xxxg1279xxx , and  xxxg801xxx , and is currently under phase i clinical evaluation as an anticancer drug. a
sensitive and specific analytical method for the quantitation of  xxxd3264xxx  and its metabolite in several monkey tissues (liver, kidney, brain and
white fat) using lc–ms–ms following semi-automated liquid–liquid extraction (lle) was developed and validated. amounts of 50 mg of
tissue were homogenized using an ultrasonic processor. after addition of the stable labelled internal standard (is) and ammonium hydroxide
(0.3%), samples were extracted with 2.5 ml of tert-butyl methyl ether. following centrifugation, aliquots of 1.8 ml of the organic phase were
transferred into a 96-well plate. the packard multiprobe ii robotic liquid handler was used to perform all steps mentioned above. the organic
phase was dried and the residue was reconstituted with 800 ␮l of 15 mm ammonium formate buffer solution (ph 3.25) using a tomtec
quadra 96 workstation. aliquots of 10 ␮l of the resulting solution were injected into the lc–ms–ms system. a symmetry shield c8 column
(50 mm × 2.1 mm, 3.5 ␮m) was used to perform the chromatographic analysis. the mobile phase was 15 mm ammonium formate buffer
solution (ph 3.25)–acetonitrile (74:26 (v/v)) with a flow-rate of 0.35 ml/min. retention times of the metabolite and  xxxd3264xxx  were about 2.5
and 3.5 min, respectively. total cycle time was 5 min. ms detection used the applied biosystems-mds sciex api 3000 with turboionspray
interface and multiple reaction monitoring (mrm) operated in positive ion mode. the method was validated for both compounds over the
calibration range of about 2 and 2000 ng/g. the suitability and robustness of the method for in vivo samples were confirmed by analysis of
monkey tissues from animals dosed with  xxxd3264xxx .

analysis of drugs in biological fluids and tissues because of
its specificity, sensitivity and high-throughput [2]. plasma
protein precipitation (ppp), liquid–liquid extraction (lle)
and solid-phase extraction (spe) are the sample preparation techniques most commonly used for processing plasma
and tissue samples [3–5]. protein precipitation has the potential to be significantly less time-consuming, especially
when transfer of the organic phase and/or evaporation steps
of lle can be avoided. however, lle for plasma and
tissues analyses tends to give cleaner extracts than ppp,
as evidenced by less matrix effects and less tendency for
back-pressure build-up in the lc column as more samples
are injected [6]. an analytical method for the determination of i and of its metabolite (ii) in human plasma by
lc–ms–ms following ppp by filtration in the 96-well
format has been already developed and fully validated [7].

this paper describes a new lc–ms–ms method for the
determination of i and ii in several monkey tissues following homogenisation of samples by an ultrasonic processor
and semi-automated lle. the lle procedure provided additional clean up given the diversity of the tissue samples,
while automation was used to minimize the resource need
for the more complex extraction. given the limited availability of some tissue types, the validation approach had to
be tailored to make the most of available tissues.

mixture of acetonitrile and 0.05 m  xxxd2154xxx  (50:50 (v/v))
was used as flushing solvent for the autosampler.
the turboionspray interface was operated in the positive
ion mode at 350 ◦ c. quantitation was performed by multiple reaction monitoring (mrm). the collision energy was
22 ev. the mass transitions (precursor to product) monitored were 399 → 326 m/z for i, 371 → 283 m/z for ii and
409 → 326 m/z for is. a dwell time of 500 ms was used for
each transition. in order to obtain the maximum sensitivity,
the quadrupoles q1 and q3 were set on low resolution by
lowering of 0.08 units the resolution offset parameters.

2. experimental
2.1. chemicals
i and ii were supplied by sugen, south san francisco,
ca, usa. stable labelled  xxxd3264xxx , the internal standard
(is), was supplied by global drug metabolism department,
pharmacia, nerviano, italy. all other chemicals and solvents were of analytical reagent grade from sigma–aldrich,
seelze, germany.
2.2. equipment
the lc system consisted of an agilent technologies
hp1100 series with degasser, binary pump and column oven
(waldbroom, germany) and a perkin-elmer lc 200 autosampler (norwalk, ct, usa). the detection system was
an api 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (applied
biosystems—mds sciex, concord, canada) equipped with
a turboionspray interface. computer software used were:
applied biosystems—mds sciex mass chrom 1.1 running lc2tune 1.4, multiview 1.4 and sample control 1.4.
robotic liquid handling systems used were: multiprobe
ii from packard (meriden, ct, usa) and tomtec quadra
96-320 (hamden, ct, usa). a high intensity ultrasonic
processor gex 600 (sonics & materials, newtown, ct,
usa) equipped with a 3 mm diameter tapered microtip was
used for tissue homogenisation. a refrigerated centrifuge
(multifuge 3, heraeus) was used to separate the phases
after lle. a 96-well dry-down station for evaporation of
the extracts (stepbio, italy) and a 96-well plate refrigerated
centrifuge (model pk120r, alc, italy) were also used. a
laboratory information management system (watson) was
used to store concentration data and generate summary
validation statistics.
2.3. lc–ms–ms conditions
the analytical separation was performed using a symmetry shield c8 column (waters, 50 mm × 2.1 mm,
3.5 mm), the mobile phase consisted of 15 mm ammonium
formate buffer solution (adjusted to ph 3.25 with 1 m
 xxxd2154xxx )–acetonitrile (74:26 (v/v)) with a flow-rate of
0.35 ml/min. the retention times of ii and i were about 2.5
and 3.5 min, respectively. total cycle time was 5 min. a

2.4. preparation of stock and working solutions and
plasma calibration standards
primary standard stock solutions of i and ii were prepared
by dissolving 6.61 mg of i and 6.15 mg of ii in methanol
into two separate 25 ml volumetric flasks, to obtain final
concentrations of 262 and 243 ␮g/ml, respectively, after
adjusting for the purities of the compounds. from these primary stock solutions, six working solutions containing i and
ii were prepared, by diluting with methanol, to final concentrations of 10500, 5240, 2620, 524, 52.4 and 10.5 ng/ml
for i, and 9720, 4860, 2430, 486, 48.6 and 9.72 ng/ml for ii.
stock solutions of both compounds were stable for at least
4 months and working solutions for at least 1 week when
stored at +4 ◦ c in the dark. due to the photo-instability of
the compounds, all dilutions were made in brown-coloured
volumetric glassware (brand, germany). aliquots of 10 ␮l
of these working standard solutions were spiked into 50 mg
blank monkey tissue to prepare calibration standards with
a concentrations range of 2.10, 10.5, 105, 524, 1050 and
2100 ng/g for i and 1.94, 9.72, 97.2, 486, 972 and 1940 ng/g
for ii. after adding 500 ␮l of 10 mm ammonium formate
the samples were sonicated for 30 s with the ultrasonic
processor.
2.5. preparation of quality control (qc) samples
primary standard stock solutions of i and ii were prepared by dissolving in methanol into two separate 25 ml
volumetric flasks 7.31 mg of i and 6.11 mg of ii to obtain
final concentrations of 290 and 241 ␮g/ml, respectively, after adjusting for the purities of the compounds. from these
primary stock solutions, three working solutions containing
i and ii were prepared by diluting with methanol to give
final concentrations of 29, 4060 and 7540 ng/ml for i and
of 30.3, 4340 and 9640 ng/ml for ii. bulk blank control homogenate was prepared by sonication of 2.5 g of monkey
liver with 25 ml of 10 mm ammonium formate solution. the
monkey tissue quality control (qc) samples were prepared
by spiking an aliquot of 10 ␮l of each working solution into
a polypropylene tube containing 525 ␮l of monkey blank tissue homogenate corresponding to 50 mg of matrix to obtain
final concentrations of 5.80 (low), 812 (mid), 1510 (high)
and 20,800 ng/g (out of range) for i and 6.06 (low), 868

s. barattè et al. / journal of chromatography a, 1024 (2004) 87–94

(mid), 1930 (high) and 19,300 ng/g (out of range) for ii. qc
samples were then frozen at −80 ◦ c until analysis.
2.6. preparation of internal standard solution
a primary standard stock solution of is was prepared by
dissolving 1.24 mg of the is in 10 ml methanol to obtain a
final concentration of 118 ␮g/ml after adjusting for the purity
of this compound. an aliquot of 0.050 ml of this primary
stock solution was diluted in 100 ml volumetric flask with
methanol to obtain a working solution of 59.0 ng/ml. stock
and working solutions were stored at +4 ◦ c.
2.7. sample preparation
fifty milligrams of each tissue sample were homogenised
in a polypropylene tube kept in an ice-bath with 500 ␮l
of 10 mm ammonium formate solution using an ultrasonic
processor for 30 s. homogenates were mixed with 50 ␮l of
ammonium hydroxide (0.3%) in order to adjust the ph to approximately 9.2 and with 50 ␮l of is working solution. the
tubes were then capped and the samples were extracted with
2.5 ml of tert-butyl methyl ether by vortex mixing for 5 min.
after centrifugation for 10 min at 1200g aliquots of 1.8 ml
of the organic phase was transferred into a 96-well plate.
the packard multiprobe ii robotic liquid handler was used
to perform all steps mentioned above. the organic phase
was dried under nitrogen gas at 37 ◦ c and the residue was
re-constituted with 800 ␮l of 15 mm ammonium formate
buffer solution (ph 3.25) using tomtec quadra 96 workstation. the plates were then capped, vortex mixed for 15 s and
centrifuged at 4000g for 10 min. an aliquot of 10 ␮l of the
resulting solution was injected into the lc–ms–ms system.
due to the photo-instability of the compounds all the procedures described above, including weighing of tissues, were
performed under light protection conditions with an orange
colored safe light (cutoff < 540 nm, slimline a5nd4 t8
safe light, encapsulite international, uk). “windows” on
the autosampler sample compartment were covered with an
orange colour safety-light film (rosco, usa).
2.8. assay validation experiments
extensive validation experiments were performed
with liver tissues followed by limited 1-day validation
experiments with the other matrices. wherever possible,
calibration and qc samples were prepared using the relevant control tissues in each case.
linearity was evaluated from four calibration curves run
on four different days over the concentration range of about
2–2000 ng/g for both the analytes. each calibration curve
included 12 calibration points (six concentration levels in
duplicate; six were run at the beginning and six at the end of
each analytical batch). calibration curves were constructed
by plotting the ratio of the area of the compounds and the is
(y) against the analyte concentration (x). is of i was used also

89

for quantitation of ii. a weighted linear regression function
(1/x2 ) was used to fit calibration lines and hence to calculate
the concentrations of i and ii in qc and unknown samples.
the weighting factor was chosen to minimize deviation of
back-calculated values from the theoretical concentrations.
intra and inter-day precision and accuracy were evaluated
by repeated analyses of qcs at three concentrations (low,
mid and high) with five replicate samples analysed every
day. parallelism (accuracy and precision of dilution of samples) study was evaluated with qc samples above the high
limit of standard level after 1:10 dilution with blank monkey tissue homogenate; five replicate samples were analysed
on one day. “in process” stability was examined after storage in tissue homogenate for 4 h at room temperature and
in final extracts at room temperature for 48 h. each stability experiment included five replicate qc samples at three
concentration levels (low, mid and high).

3. results and discussion
the method used to determine i and ii in different monkey tissues consisted of homogenisation of the tissue using
an ultrasonic processor followed by a semi-automated lle
that provide cleaner extracts compare to other techniques.
two different tissue preparation techniques by an ultrasonic processor and using a micro-dismembrator (b. braun,
germany) were tested prior the validation experiments.
although both provided adequate extraction, the ultrasonic
probe was selected as faster and more practical considering
the number of study samples anticipated. preparation of the
tissues before weighting was made by hand cutting avoiding
the presence of fibers that make the samples difficult to be
homogenized. the tapered microtip ultrasonic probe used
minimized cross-contamination of the samples and helped
in the washing procedures after each sample preparation.
the extraction step was relatively rapid and conducted
entirely with automated systems using disposable tips to
avoid carry-over. the packard multiprobe ii has the flexibility of pipetting samples from tubes to 96-well plates.
on the other hand, the tomtec quadra 96 workstation is
equipped with 96 tips and is capable of pipetting 96 samples simultaneously. in the current method, the multiprobe
ii was programmed to add the is and reagents and transfer the organic phase from the individual tubes to 96-well
deep plates. after evaporation, the plates were moved to
the quadra 96 for reconstitution.
adequate chromatographic separation is required for the
quantitative determination of drugs in biological samples
[8,9]. i and ii were adequately retained on the column used
with full baseline resolution. the narrow column avoided
the use of a post column tee splitter and proved to be quite
robust. no guard column was used. to avoid carry-over effects from the autosampler two pre- and two post-injection
washes with 0.5 ml each of flushing solvent were made.

for ethical reasons only one monkey was sacrificed to
provide blank control tissues. whilst no difficulties were
met with the availability of the liver tissue, the other tissues
were in limited supply. for this reason, extensive validation
experiments were performed only in monkey liver. chromatograms of blank monkey liver (figs. 3 and 4) demonstrated the absence of interfering peaks in the transition
channel of both analytes and also the is. no peak higher than
20% of the analyte peak area at lower limit of quantitation
(lloq) level was detected. the method was linear over the
concentration range of about 2–2000 ng/g. the linear correlation coefficients (r2 ) ranged from 0.9904 to 0.9990 for
i and from 0.9884 to 0.9985 for ii. the mean calibration
curves obtained were described by the following equations:
y = 0.0241 + 0.00504 (slope cv = 1.1%, n = 3) for i and
y = 0.0366x + 0.0154 (slope cv = 11.8%, n = 3) for ii.
the mean back-calculated concentration values for the calibration standards showed a bias ranging from −1.9 to 2.9%
for i and from −3.9 to 3.9% for ii. coefficient of variations
relative standard deviations (r.s.d.s) ranged from 2.1 to
11.2% for i and 4.9 to 7.7% for ii. typical chromatograms
obtained for the lloq for i and ii are shown in fig. 5.
the intra-assay precision, evaluated with qc samples prepared in monkey liver and expressed as r.s.d., ranged from
1.4 to 3.6% for i and 5.4 to 8.6% for ii. the intra-day accuracy (expressed as % bias) ranged from −1.0 to 7.9% for i
and −7.1 to 0.3% for ii. the inter-day precision evaluated
at the same concentrations over three validation days ranged
from 2.4 to 9.6% for i and 4.5 to 7.6% for ii. the inter-day

93

accuracy ranged from −1.3 to 2.2% for i and −9.4 to 2.1%
for ii.
parallelism expressed by the intra-day precision with out
of range qc samples was 12.4% for i and 10.5% for ii. the
intra-day bias was −13.0% for i and 0.0% for ii.
there was no evidence of degradation of i or ii after storage in liver homogenate at room temperature for 4 h in the
dark. in this stability study, precision ranged from 0.8 to
13.3% for i and 6.3 to 15.4% for ii and bias ranged from
−1.8 to 7.6% for i and −4.1 to 2.8% for ii. the stability
of i and ii from tissue extracts were also tested in the autosampler. after storage at room temperature for 48 h in the
dark, precision of qcs ranged from 1.8 to 4.9% for i and
6.5 to 11.7% for ii and accuracy ranged from −7.3 to 3.4%
for i and 8.0 to 22.7% for ii. these results suggest that there
was no significant instability for both i and ii under normal
sample preparation and analysis conditions.
intra-day precision and accuracy of i and ii, evaluated
with qc samples in monkey kidney, brain and white fat,
met standard validation requirements [10]. the intra-assay
precision ranged from 1.2 to 7.0% for i and 3.2 to 5.0% for
ii in the kidney, from 4.1 to 12.5% for i and 4.7 to 7.8% for
ii in the brain and from 3.6 to 20.8% for i and 4.5 to 19.6%
for ii in the white fat.
the intra-day accuracy ranged from −11.1 to −1.4% for
i and −11.9 to −2.6% for ii in the kidney, from −7.6 to
3.6% for i and −9.1 to 6.7% for ii in the brain and from
9.9 to 11.7% for i and 4.7 to 13.0% for ii in the white
fat.

the method described here is sensitive and selective for
the determination of i and ii in monkey tissues. it proved
to be precise and capable of accurately determining the two
compounds in the 2–2000 ng/g concentration range. the
method was extremely useful for monitoring tissue levels
of i and ii in a toxicity study in the monkey treated with
i. the validated lloq of the method proved to be completely satisfactory for full evaluation of tissue exposure of i
and ii.
