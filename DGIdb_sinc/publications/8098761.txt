in vivo microdialysis evidence for central serotonin1a and serotonin1b autoreceptor blocking properties of the beta adrenoceptor antagonist (-)penb...  recently, we found that the beta 1/beta 2 adrenoceptor blocking agent (-) xxxd2869xxx  prevents behavioral and biochemical actions of the specific serotonin (5-ht)1a agonist (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin. the putative 5-ht1 receptor antagonist profile of (-) xxxd2869xxx  was further explored in the present study, using in vivo microdialysis methods to assess its effects on central 5-ht release. (+) xxxd2869xxx  and (-) xxxd2957xxx  were included for comparison purposes. in contrast to (-) xxxd2957xxx  (8.0 mg/kg s.c.), administration of (-) xxxd2869xxx  (2.0 or 8.0 mg/kg s.c.) increased hippocampal 5-ht output. the (-) xxxd2869xxx -induced 5-ht response was dose-related, stereoselective and ca(++)-dependent. in addition, the 5-ht response to (-) xxxd2869xxx  was abolished by omitting the 5-ht reuptake blocker citalopram from the perfusion medium, suggesting the need for endogenous 5-ht tone. local (-) xxxd2869xxx  (1 microm) perfusion increased the 5-ht output per se, and also blocked 5-ht release suppression caused by the  xxxg1109xxx  agonist cp-93,129. furthermore, (-) xxxd2869xxx , but not its (+)antipode, prevented the decrease of 5-ht release induced by the  xxxg1108xxx  agonist (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin. by comparison, the 5-ht1 receptor inactive beta adrenoceptor blockers metoprolol (beta 1) and ici 118,551 (beta 2), given alone or in combination, did not increase 5-ht output and were ineffective in antagonizing the (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin response. the data indicate that (-) xxxd2869xxx  possesses 5-ht1a and 5-ht1b autoreceptor antagonist properties, and may be a useful tool in studies of central 5-ht receptor-mediated function.
