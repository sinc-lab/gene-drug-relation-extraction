 xxxg110xxx  (adh) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldh) exhibit
genetic polymorphism and tissue specificity. a d h and a l d h isozyme phenotypes from 39 surgical chinese lung specimens were identified by agarose
isoelectric focusing. the identity of the lung ~-adhs was further demonstrated
by their characteristic ph-activity profiles for ethanol oxidation, k~ values for
nad and ethanol, and inhibition by  xxxd2148xxx  or 1, l o-phenanthroline.
the ~2 allele, coding for [32polypeptide , was found to be predominant in the lung
specimens studied. the a d h activities in the lungs with the homozygous
phenotype a d h 2 2-2 (exhibiting [32~2) and a d h 2 1-1 (exhibiting ¢31131)and the
heterozygous phenotype a d h 2 2-1 (exhibiting ~2¢3~ ¢32~1, and 131~1) were determined to be 999 +- 77, 48 + 17, and 494 +_ 61 nmol/min/g tissue, respectively.
fifty-one percent of the specimens studied lacked the a l d h 2 activity band on
the isoelectric focusing gels. the activities in the lung tissues with the aldh2active phenotype and the inactive phenotype were determined to be 30 +_ 3 and
17 +_ 1 nmol/min/g tissue, respectively. these findings indicate that human
pulmonary  xxxd102xxx metabolizing activities differ significantly with respect to
genetic polymorphism at both the a d h 2 and the a l d h 2 loci. the results

suggest that individuals with high vmax[32-adh and deficient in low-k mmitochondrial  xxxg132xxx , accounting for approximately 45% of the chinese population,
may end up with acetaldehyde accumulation during alcohol consumption,
rendering them vulnerable to tissue injury caused by this highly reactive and toxic
metabolite.

introduction

 xxxg110xxx  (adh; alcohol:nad oxidoreductase; ec 1.1.1.1)
and aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldh; aldehyde:nad oxidoreductase; ec
1.2.1.3) are the major enzymes responsible for ethanol oxidation in humans
(bosron and li, 1986; yin and li, 1989; kennedy and tipton, 1990). these
two enzymes catalyze the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde and then to
acetic acid, respectively. both the human adh and the human aldh
exhibit genetic polymorphism and tissue specificity (smith, 1986). the adh
isozymes can be grouped into three classes according to their structural and
kinetic characteristics (vallee and bazzone, 1983; j6rnvall et al., 1989).
low-k, class i adhs comprise homo- and heterodimeric molecules containing ol,[3, or ~ subunits. genetic polymorphism occurs at t h e a d h 2 andadh 3
gene loci, coding for [31, [32, [33 and %, ~= polypeptide subunits, respectively
(bosron and li, 1986; smith, 1986). the [32 alleles are predominant among
orientals and the [31 in caucasians, while the [33 alleles are unique in black
populations. human aldhs can be divided into two classes based on their
km values for acetaldehyde, low-kin (mk/ range)  xxxg127xxx  and  xxxg132xxx 
(greenfield and pietruszko, 1977), and high-kin (ram range)  xxxg133xxx  and
aldh4 (wang et al., 1990; forte-mcrobbie and pietruszko, 1986). approximately 50% of orientals lack mitochondrial  xxxg132xxx , and this deficiency
contributes to alcohol reactions such as facial flushing, vasodilatation, and
tachycardia after the intake of relatively small amounts of ethanol (harada
et al., 1980b; agarwal and goedde, 1989).
recently, high-v~ [32- and -yl-adhs as well as inactive  xxxg132xxx  have
been suggested as negative risk factors for alcoholism in orientals (harada
et al., 1983; thomasson et al., 1991). this can be attributed to the marked
elevation of blood acetaldehyde after ethanol consumption, which mediates
alcohol sensitivity (mizoi et al., 1979; harada et ai., 1982; enomoto et al.,
1991). acetaldehyde is chemically highly reactive and has been implicated in
alcohol-induced tissue damage (lieber, 1988; peters and ward, 1988). since
[3-adh and  xxxg132xxx  were reported to be expressed in human lung (smith et
al., 1971; harada et al., 1980a) and genetic polymorphism at both theadh=
and the a l d h 2 gene loci occurs in oriental populations, it is intriguing to

predict that the pulmonary  xxxd102xxx metabolizing capabilities may vary in
individuals with different genetic phenotypes. this study was undertaken to
identify and characterize kinetic properties of the lung adhs and to
determine a d h and aldh activities in the surgical tissues from chinese.
the results are in good agreement with the predictions and suggest that
differential susceptibilities to alcohol-induced cell injury might exist in
oriental populations.

materials

and methods

chemicals. nad and  xxxd2148xxx  were purchased from sigma (st.
louis, mo); carrier ampholytes ampholine and pharmalyte were obtained
from pharmacia-lkb (uppsala, sweden); isogel was from fmc (rockland,
me); and ethanol, acetaldehyde, and 1,10-phenanthroline were from merck
(darmstadt, germany). acetaldehyde was redistilled before use. all other
chemicals were commercially available and of analytical grade.
human lung tissue. surgical lung specimens from adult chinese (age,
42-75 years; 29 males and 10 females) were obtained during routine
operations for pulmonary resection. lesion and the adjacent normal portions were dissected for histopathological examinations. the normal portions were used in the present study. the duration between resection and
storing the tissues at -70°c was less than 30 rain. the tissue a d h and
aldh activities were stable at this storage temperature for at least 6
months.
preparation of homogenate supernatants. lung tissue (0.2-0.3 g) was
homogenized in 2 vol (v/w) of ice-cold 10 mm sodium phosphate, ph 7.5,
with a polytron homogenizer. the resulting homogenate was centrifuged at
100,000g for 1 hr at 4°c. the supernatants were kept in an ice bath for
enzymatic studies.
agarose isoelectric focusing. a d h isozymes were separated by an
agarose isoelectric focusing procedure using a mixture of ampholine, ph
3.5-10, 7-9, and 9-11, and stained for enzyme activity as described previously (yin et al., 1984a). aldh isozymes were identified by isoelectric
focusing using a mixture of pharmalyte, ph 3-10 and 5-8 (yin et al., 1988).
protein determination. protein concentration was determined by the
lowry method (lowry et al., 1951), using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard.
enzymaticassay. a d h activity was determined spectrophotometrically
at 340 nm and 30°c with 33 mm ethanol, 2.4 mm nad, and 1 mm
 xxxd3392xxx  (without  xxxd3392xxx  in the ph 10.5 assay) in three buffers:
0.1 m sodium phosphate, ph 7.5; 0.1 m sodium pyrophosphate, ph 8.5; and
0.1 m glycine-naoh, ph 10.5. aldh activity was assayed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm and 30°c in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, ph 7.5, containing

yin, liao, chen, fan, and lee

206

100 gm acetaldehyde, 2.4 mm nad, 1 mm edta, and 10 mm  xxxd2148xxx . a 5-min assay in the absence of ethanol or acetaldehyde was subtracted
as blank. during aldh assay, stoppered cuvettes were used to avoid
acetaldehyde evaporation. enzyme activities of adh and aldh are expressed as nanomoles of nadh produced per minute, based on an extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm -1 c m -1 at 340 nm.
inhibition studies. to determine the inhibition of adh by  xxxd2148xxx , activity was measured in 0.1 m sodium pyrophosphate at ph 8.5 and
30°c, containing 33 mm ethanol, 2.4 mm nad, 1 mm  xxxd3392xxx , with or
without the addition of 0.2 mm  xxxd2148xxx . 1,10-phenanthroline
inhibition was performed under the same assay conditions but using varied
concentrations of the inhibitor and at 25°c.
kinetic constants. k,, and vm,x values for ethanol oxidation for lung
adh were determined in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, ph 7.5, and 25°c, at
0.2-5 mm ethanol and 2.4 mm nad or at 0.09-0.9 mm nad and 20 mm
ethanol. the kinetic data were analyzed with cleland's hyper statistical
program (cleland, 1979). the coefficients of variation for kmand vmax w e r e
less than 5%.
statistics. statistical significance of difference between enzyme activities of the two aldh phenotypic groups was evaluated by student's t test
and by duncan's test following analysis of variance for the three adh
phenotypic groups (zar, 1974).
results
 xxxg110xxx  isozymes from surgical lung tissues were separated
by agarose isoelectric focusing and stained for  xxxd102xxx oxidizing activity at
ph 8.5 (fig. 1). three isozyme patterns were observed: two homozygous
phenotypes, adh 2 1-1, which exhibited [31131only, and adh 2 2-2, which
exhibited [32[32 only; and a heterozygous phenotype, adh22-1, which revealed a mixture of [32[32, [32131,and [31131.as shown in fig. 1, class i el-,[3-, and
~-adhs and class ii ,rr-adh were expressed in the liver.

types exhibited activities two times as great as those for the heterozygous
a d h 2 2-1 phenotypes and 20 times those for the homozygous a d h 2 1-1
phenotypes. the ph 10.5/8.5 activity ratios for the [32-containing samples
(both the homozygous a d h 2 2-2 and the heterozygous a d h 2 2-1 phenotype) were lower than 1.0, whereas the [3~-containing  xxxg73xxx  1-1 samples
were greater than 1.0. inhibition of 0.2 mm  xxxd2148xxx  at ph 8.5 for
lung [32[32 and [31131 activities was clearly distinct, i.e., about 90 and 30%,
respectively.
ph-activity profiles of human lung a d h s are shown in fig. 2. [32[32and
[31131 exhibited a ph optimum for ethanol oxidation at ph 8.5 and 10,
respectively. the specific activity of the lung [32[32was considerably greater
than that of [3113tover a wide ph range. the [32[32activity was inhibited by the
metal-chelating agent, 1,10-phenanthroline (fig. 3). the apparent concentration for 50% inhibition was determined to be 61 gm. this inhibition
could be reversed by dilution of the inhibitor (fig. 3). km values for ethanol
and nad for the lung [32[32were determined to be 0.81 and 0.17 mm,
respectively, and the vmax value was 10 nmol/min/mg soluble protein.
kinetic constants for the lung [3113~were difficult to measure because of its
much lower specific activity.

isozyme patterns of lung aldh were identified by agarose isoelectric

 xxxg133xxx  isozymes were detectable in only 44% of the lung samples. most of
the  xxxg133xxx  activity bands were stained faintly to moderately intensely. only
4 of 39 (10%) exhibited intense  xxxg133xxx  bands. as shown in table ii,
aldh activity of the  xxxg132xxx -active group was about 80% greater than that
of the  xxxg132xxx -inactive group.
discussion

starch gel electrophoresis (smith et al., 1971) and agarose isoelectric
focusing (fig. 1) demonstrated that [3-adhs are specifically expressed in
the lung tissue. since other class i adhs such as ~- or y-adh and class ii
rr-adh were not expressed (fig. 1), the lung tissue is best for phenotyping
the  xxxg73xxx  loci. class iii x-adh was seen on isoelectric focusing gels when

polymorphism and activities of human lung adh and aldh

211

adh22 andadh21 were calculated to be 73 and 27%, respectively, fitting well
the hardy-weinberg equilibrium distribution (x2= 0.0198). these gene
frequencies for the chinese population in taiwan are similar to those
determined from autopsy livers (chao et al., 1987) and to those determined
by genotyping from white blood cells with the use of polymerase chain
reaction amplification and allele-specific oligonucleotide probes (thomasson et al, 1991). the adh22 allele is predominant among chinese, japanese, and other orientals of mongoloid ethnicity (bosron and li, 1986;
smith, 1986; yin and li, 1989). in contrast, the gene frequency of this
132-coding allele is usually less than 5% among caucasian populations.
13-adh allelozymes, 131131, 132132' and [33[33' have been isolated and
characterized from human liver of different races (bosron et al, 1983; yin et
al., 1984b; burnell et al., 1989). they exhibit substantially distinct kinetic
properties. the lung 132132and [3i[31 exhibited a ph-optimum for ethanol
oxidation at 8.5 and 10, respectively (fig. 2), similar to that for the respective
liver [3-adhs. k mvalues for nad and ethanol for the lung [32[32were 0.17
and 0.81 mm, respectively. these data are close to those for the liver 132132
(0.18 and 0.94 mm) (yin et al., 1984b). the liver [31131,however, exhibits a
much lower k mvalue for both the coenzyme and the substrate ethanol, i.e.,
0.0074 and 0.049 mm, respectively (bosron et al, 1983). the vmaxfor ethanol
oxidation for the liver [32[32 is considerably greater than that of [31131 (yin et
al., 1984b). this has been attributed to a single amino acid substitution, a
weak base, histidine, in [32 for a strong base, arginine, in [31, at position 47
(j6rnvall et al, 1984), which binds to the phosphate group of the coenzyme
(eklund et al., 1987). nadh dissociation is the rate-limiting step for ethanol
oxidation reaction catalyzed by the liver [32132 and [31131(yin et al, 1984b;
boston et al, 1983). compatible with this rate-limiting step in enzyme
catalysis, the specific activities of the lung [32[32 were higher than those of [31131
over a wide ph range (fig. 2). the lung [32[32 was instantaneously and
reversibly inhibited by the chelating agent 1,10-phenanthroline (fig. 3). the
apparent concentration of 50% inhibition is similar to that of other class i
adhs (lange et al., 1976), suggesting an involvement of zinc ion in the
enzymatic reaction mechanism.
after low to moderate uptake of alcohol in humans, the blood ethanol
concentration is usually below 33 mm (li, 1983), a saturating concentration
for the class i or-, [3-, and y-adhs except 133133 (bosron et al., 1983; yin et al.,
1984b; burnell et al., 1989). at this concentration and near physiological ph
7.5, the specific a d h activity in the lung tissues of the homozygous adh 2
2-2 phenotype was 2 times and 20 times greater than that for the heterozygous a d h 2 2-1 and the homozygous a d h 2 1-1 phenotype, respectively,
whether expressed per gram of tissue or per milligram of soluble protein
(table i). this is consistent with the much higher vmaxfor the purified liver

212

[32[32 as compared to [31131(bosron et al., 1983; yin et al., 1984b). since
approximately 90% of the orientals including chinese and japanese possess
[32-adhs (yin et al, 1984a; chao et al., 1987) (table i), the majority of the
populations would have a greater ethanol oxidation rate in the lung. as for
caucasians, the situation is reversed; less than 10% of the population
possesses [32-adhs (bosron and li, 1981). in black americans, approximately 30% of individuals possess high-v~,a~ [33-adhs, which is due to a
single amino acid substitution, cysteine for arginine, at position 369 (bosron
and li, 1981; burnell et al., 1987). it would be reasonable to speculate that
these individuals might also have a higher adh activity in the lung. this
remains to be determined experimentally.
fifty-one percent of the chinese lung specimens studied lacked the
 xxxg132xxx  activity (table ii) as revealed by agarose isoelectric focusing (fig.
4). this frequency is similar to that obtained from the autopsy liver studies
for chinese (chao et al., 1987) and japanese (harada et al., 1980b). in
contrast, the  xxxg132xxx  deficiency is very rare in caucasians. the loss of the
enzyme activity has been attributed to a point mutation which produces a
 xxxd2431xxx -to-lysine exchange (yoshida et al, 1984; hempel et al, 1984).
the mutant allele aldh22 is dominant over the normal  xxxg132xxx  ~ allele, i.e.,
persons both homozygous and heterozygous for aldh22 lack detectable
 xxxg132xxx  activity in liver (crabb et al, 1989). the aldh activity of the lung
tissues exhibiting the  xxxg132xxx -active phenotype was significantly higher than
that for the inactive phenotypes (table ii), suggesting that a lower rate of
acetaldehyde oxidation may occur in the  xxxg132xxx -deficient individuals.
moreover, the km for acetaldehyde for  xxxg132xxx  is at least 10 times lower
than that for  xxxg127xxx  (greenfield and pietruszko, 1977). this deficiency
would therefore result in acetaldehyde accumulation in the lung cells during
ethanol metabolism. indeed, the blood acetaldehyde concentration of the
individuals lacking  xxxg132xxx  activity can reach about 50 ~m, compared with 5
~m for the  xxxg132xxx -active individuals after drinking a moderate amount of
ethanol (harada et al, 1982; enomoto et al., 1991). multiple  xxxg133xxx 
isozymes were seen in some of the lung specimens (fig. 4). unlike the
high-activity  xxxg133xxx  in human gastric mucosa (yin et al, 1988), the lung
 xxxg133xxx  activities were much lower. since the km for acetaldehyde for
 xxxg133xxx  isozymes is very high, 88 mm (wang et al, 1990), they appear not to
contribute to acetaldehyde oxidation in vivo.
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is common among individuals
who abuse ethanol (van thiel, 1983). alcoholics also have a greater risk of
developing lung abscesses than the general population. the underlying
mechanisms for these clinical observations are still unclear. tables i and ii
indicate that significant adh and aldh activities exist in the human lung.
this suggests that, in addition to pulmonary excretion of ethanol, a signifi-

cant m e t a b o l i s m of ethanol m a y occur in this tissue. acetaldehyde, an
i m m e d i a t e m e t a b o l i t e of ethanol, has recently received considerable attention due to its involvement in the pathogenesis of alcohol-related organ
d a m a g e and its functional role in alcohol sensitivity (lieber, 1988; peters
and ward, 1988; agarwal and g o e d d e , 1989; yin and li, 1989). in caucasians, since the specific activity of 131-adh is extremely low and the low-k m
a l d h 2 is always active, acetaldehyde would be efficiently and completely
oxidized in the lung during alcohol consumption. in orientals, however,
individuals having high-vmax [32-adh and deficient in a l d h 2 activity,
accounting for about 90% x 50% = 45% of the population, might end up
with a c e t a l d e h y d e accumulation in the lung cell (tables i and ii). t h e s e
individuals m a y b e c o m e m o r e vulnerable to acetaldehyde-induced organ
injury during alcohol drinking. it is t h e r e f o r e p r o p o s e d that acetaldehyde
can play a dual role which affects drinking behavior and pathophysiological
consequences in orientals: aversion to heavy drinking due to acetaldehyde
sensitivity, thus protecting against alcohol abuse and alcoholism, as well as
causing tissue and organ d a m a g e due to its chemical reactivity and cytotoxicity. c o m p a r i s o n s of incidence and severity of alcohol-related p u l m o n a r y
diseases occurring a m o n g alcoholics with different genotypes at the a d h 2
a n d a l d h 2 loci are t h e r e f o r e n e e d e d to substantiate the p r o p o s e d toxic role
of a c e t a l d e h y d e in humans.
