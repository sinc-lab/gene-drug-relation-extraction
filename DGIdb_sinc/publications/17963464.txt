rapid reperfusion is the key treatment goal in patients with st-segment
elevation myocardial infarction (stemi). the american college of
cardiology–american heart association (acc-aha) 2004 guidelines for the
management of stemi include recommendations for pharmacologic
reperfusion with use of fibrinolytic agents. fibrinolytic agents are the
preferred pharmacologic class for the management of stemi because of their
ability to achieve reperfusion and to restore blood flow when administered
within 12 hours of symptom onset. four fibrinolytic agents are approved for
the treatment of stemi in the united states—streptokinase,  xxxg1766xxx ,
reteplase, and  xxxd3308xxx . several clinical trials have demonstrated the
beneficial effects of these therapies in reducing mortality rates in patients with
suspected acute myocardial infarction.  xxxg1766xxx  is administered as an
intravenous infusion. however, the relatively long half-lives of reteplase and
 xxxd3308xxx  enable bolus administration, which may be more convenient and
less time consuming. reteplase is administered as a double bolus, and dosing
does not depend on the patient’s weight;  xxxd3308xxx  is administered as a
single bolus, and dosing is weight based. adherence to the acc-aha
guidelines, as well as knowledge about the available fibrinolytic agents, is
essential for physicians and pharmacists to make informed decisions
regarding appropriate pharmacologic reperfusion strategies.

health concern, with approximately 565,000 new
attacks and 300,000 recurrent events annually.1
acute myocardial infarction most commonly
arises from the disruption of atherosclerotic
plaque residing in the vascular wall and is
associated with several complications, including
heart failure, arrhythmias, conduction disturbances, cardiogenic shock, ventricular rupture,
decreased ventricular function, and premature
death.2, 3
acute myocardial infarction is categorized as
either st-segment elevation myocardial infarction
(stemi) or non–st-segment elevation
myocardial infarction (non-stemi). 4 the
diagnosis of stemi is based on the classic triad
of clinical presentation (ischemic chest pain or
equivalent), elevated levels of serum cardiac
damage biomarkers (creatine kinase–mb and
troponin), and an st elevation on a 12-lead

electrocardiogram (ecg). patients with a
diagnosis of non-stemi present with similar
symptoms and biomarkers in the blood but
without an st elevation on the ecg.4
the incidence of stemi is approximately
500,000 events/year.4 although rapid reperfusion
is the key treatment goal in patients with stemi,
an investigation of data from the global registry
of acute coronary events (grace) revealed that
30% of 1763 reperfusion-eligible patients with
stemi who presented within 12 hours of
symptom onset did not receive any type of
reperfusion therapy.5 the american college of
cardiology–american heart association (accaha) 2004 guidelines for the treatment of
patients with acute myocardial infarction provide
comprehensive evidence-based recommendations
about pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic
reperfusion strategies: treatment with a fibrinolytic

the guidelines also provide recommendations
regarding other adjunctive therapies used as

(table 1).4, 6
treatment delay for st-segment elevation
myocardial infarction
regardless of the reperfusion strategy chosen,
the overarching treatment goal for patients who
experience stemi is to shorten the total ischemic
time as much as possible.4 prompt reperfusion
reduces infarct size, preserves left ventricular
function, and reduces mortality.7, 8 for optimal
outcomes, the acc-aha guidelines recommend
a maximum time frame of 30 minutes from
patient presentation to the time a fibrinolytic
agent is administered (or “door-to-needle” time)
and a maximum of 90 minutes for “door-toballoon” time for pci intervention (table 2).4
the acc-aha guidelines do not include a
preference for either pci or fibrinolysis for
patients who are seen within 3 hours of symptom
onset, even in the absence of delays to initiation
of an invasive strategy.4 when a delay of more
than 3 hours between symptom onset and
presentation exists, and if pci can be started
within the recommended 90-minute time frame,
the acc-aha recommends pci as the preferred
reperfusion strategy.4 however, performance of
pci depends on the availability of an interventional cardiology facility, and it is estimated
that only 25% of hospitals in the united states
are equipped to perform pci.4, 9 furthermore,
substantial variations exist in the geographic
distribution of pci-equipped hospitals in the
united states: 98% of adults in urban areas, as
opposed to less than 50% of adults in rural areas,

live within 60 minutes of a pci-equipped
hospital.9 transferring patients to pci-equipped
hospitals has been reported to cause delays in
treatment of more than 3 hours, which far
exceeds the acc-aha–recommended door-toballoon time.10
the aha’s interventional procedures data
registry, which collects heart disease and stroke
statistics from u.s. hospitals, reports a mean
door-to-balloon time of 124 minutes.1 in a study
of 4278 patients with stemi who were
transferred to pci-equipped hospitals, only 4.2%
of patients received treatment within 90
minutes. 11 delays in performing pci are
associated with increased mortality rates.12–15 in
circumstances where prolonged pci delays are
anticipated, immediate administration of a
fibrinolytic agent could be advantageous in
reducing mortality.
fibrinolytic agents
fibrinolytics are the preferred pharmacologic
class for the treatment of stemi6 because they
can achieve reperfusion, unlike drugs from other
classes (table 1). fibrinolytics act by converting
plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn cleaves
fibrin, thereby causing clot dissolution and
restoration of blood flow to ischemic tissues
(figure 1).16 fibrinolytics can effectively restore
blood flow if administered within 12 hours of
symptom onset, but maximum benefit is
obtained when they are administered promptly.4
administration of fibrinolytic therapy within the
first hour of symptom onset is reported to save
approximately 35 lives/1000 patients, whereas
administration of fibrinolytic therapy within
7–12 hours after symptom onset saves
approximately 16 lives/1000 patients.6 several
large, well-designed clinical trials have

demonstrated the beneficial effects of fibrinolytic
therapy in reducing mortality rates among
patients with stemi.17 of importance, these
effects were observed independent of the patient’s
sex, blood pressure, heart rate, or previous
history of myocardial infarction or diabetes
mellitus.
the current acc-aha guidelines define
circumstances under which treatment with
fibrinolytic agents is preferred to pci (table 2).
according to the guidelines, fibrinolytics should
be used instead of pci if symptom duration is 3
hours or less and if anticipated door-to-balloon
time is more than 90 minutes, or if an invasive
strategy is not an option.4 fibrinolytics may also
be preferable in low-risk patients (i.e., patients
with mortality risk < 4.0%) since pci does not
provide any mortality benefit over fibrinolytic
therapy for these patients.18 results of a recent
study suggest that fibrinolytic agents may be a
more suitable treatment option than pci for
patients with stemi and renal failure. 19 the
study included 132 patients with stemi and a
serum creatinine concentration of 1.5 mg/dl or
greater. the 30-day crude mortality rate was
significantly lower among patients treated with
fibrinolytics compared with those treated with
pci (8.3% vs 40%, p=0.03). use of fibrinolytics
in patients with renal failure is also supported by
the fact that patients with end-stage renal failure

four fibrinolytic drugs are approved in the
united states. among these, streptokinase, a
fibrin-nonspecific agent, was the first fibrinolytic
approved by the united states food and drug
administration (fda).16, 21, 22 however, severe
internal bleeding, allergic reactions, and limited
efficacy led to the introduction of the fibrinspecific agents  xxxg1766xxx , reteplase, and
 xxxd3308xxx , which were developed through
genetic sequencing of a tissue-type plasminogen
activator. 16, 21, 22 unlike streptokinase, which
causes an indirect conformational change in
plasminogen molecules, the fibrin-specific agents
enzymatically break down plasminogen to
plasmin. 22 these agents were developed to
improve safety and efficacy and achieve a
relatively longer half-life to enable rapid bolus
administration.21 the key characteristics of the
four fibrinolytic agents are summarized in table
3.4, 21, 23–27
molecular biology of the fibrin-specific
fibrinolytic agents
 xxxg1766xxx 
 xxxg1766xxx , which is referred to as the “secondgeneration fibrinolytic,” was the first fibrinspecific agent to be synthesized through genetic
modification of wild-type tissue plasminogen
activator by using recombinant dna technology.28
both the wild-type tissue plasminogen activator
and  xxxg1766xxx  consist of several domains, each of
which is associated with a specific function
(figure 2).29 among these, the protease domain
is responsible for the conversion of plasminogen
to plasmin, whereas the kringle 2 domain,
associated with low-affinity fibrin binding,
accelerates conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin.
other domains include the fibronectin fingerlike
domain, which is associated with high-affinity
fibrin binding; an  xxxg681xxx 
domain that accelerates clearance in the liver;

and a kringle 1 domain associated with receptor
binding. in addition, the protease domain
contains a binding site for plasminogen activator
inhibitor type 1 (pai-1), and the molecule
contains carbohydrate side chains that serve as
mediators of plasma clearance. attempts to

retains the kringle 2 and protease domains
(figure 2).23 fibrin specificity is maintained by
retaining the kringle 2 domain; fibrin binding is
reduced due to the absence of the fibronectin
fingerlike domain.28 as a result of the reduced
fibrin binding, reteplase penetrates the clot and
activates the plasminogen within, whereas
 xxxg1766xxx , which binds tightly to fibrin, accumulates
on the surface of the clot, rendering subsequent
lysis of the clot dependent on the supply of
plasminogen from plasma.30 this may explain
the greater clot lysis potency achieved in vitro
with reteplase compared with  xxxg1766xxx . 30
reteplase has a longer half-life than  xxxg1766xxx 
because of the deletion of the epidermal growth
factor and carbohydrate side chains, thus
enabling bolus administration (table 3).23
 xxxd3308xxx 
 xxxd3308xxx  is also a recombinant variant of
 xxxg1766xxx  (figure 2) and has the highest degree of
fibrin specificity and binding among the available
agents.23 although the clinical significance of
high fibrin specificity has not been fully
elucidated, increased fibrin specificity may be
associated with lower noncerebral bleeding risk,
as the activity of fibrin-specific agents is
restricted to plasmin on the fibrin surface, which
causes less systemic fibrinogen degradation.21, 31
compared with  xxxg1766xxx  and reteplase,
 xxxd3308xxx  has a longer half-life (table 3) due
to a point mutation in the carbohydrate side
chain that reduces clearance of the molecule.
furthermore,  xxxd3308xxx  is more resistant to
inhibition by pai-1 because of additional point
mutations in the protease domains.
major clinical trials
numerous large-scale clinical trials have been
conducted over the past 20 years to examine
fibrinolytic therapy in the management of
stemi. overall, these trials support the role of
fibrinolytic therapy in reducing stemi-related
mortality (table 4).31–39
two large, randomized, placebo-controlled
studies in patients with acute myocardial
infarction—gruppo italiano per lo studio della
 xxxd3245xxx  nell’infarto miocardico [gissi]32
and the second international study of infarct
survival [isis-2])33, 40—demonstrated that a 60minute intravenous infusion of streptokinase
1,500,000 iu significantly reduced mortality after
acute myocardial infarction. in the gissi trial,
21-day mortality was 10.7% in patients receiving

1563

streptokinase versus 13.0% in control patients
(those receiving standard treatment), representing
an 18.0% reduction in mortality (p=0.0002,
relative risk 0.81). in isis-2, streptokinase was
associated with 29 fewer deaths/1000 patients
during days 0–35, 28 fewer deaths/1000 patients
after 4 years, and 23 fewer deaths/1000 patients
after 10 years. this study also evaluated
concomitant oral administration of low-dose
aspirin 160 mg/day over 1 month. concomitant
aspirin was associated with 26 fewer deaths/1000
patients during the first 35 days, and the survival
benefit appeared to persist for at least 10 years.
the global utilization of streptokinase and
tissue plasminogen activator for occluded
coronary arteries (gusto) trial was conducted
to determine whether earlier and sustained
reperfusion with  xxxg1766xxx  could improve survival
in patients with acute myocardial infarction. 34
the benefit of an accelerated (90-min) infusion
of  xxxg1766xxx  was evaluated in 41,021 patients.
treatment with  xxxg1766xxx  resulted in a 14%
relative reduction in 30-day mortality compared
with treatment with streptokinase. the results of
this study support the increased use of fibrinspecific fibrinolytics for pharmacologic
reperfusion in stemi, although an increased
frequency of hemorrhagic stroke seen in patients
administered accelerated  xxxg1766xxx  renders the
selection of fibrin-specific therapy a risk-versusbenefit decision.
in the international joint efficacy comparison
of thrombolytics (inject) trial, which
compared reteplase with streptokinase, mortality
rates were slightly but not significantly lower
with reteplase (9.53% streptokinase, 9.02%
reteplase, p=ns).35 the reteplase angiographic
phase ii international dose-finding (rapid-i)36
and reteplase versus  xxxg1766xxx  patency
investigation during myocardial infarction
(rapid-ii) 37 trials (primarily designed to
evaluate coronary artery patency) reported lower,
although nonsignificant, mortality rates with
reteplase compared with  xxxg1766xxx  (rapid-i 30day mortality: reteplase 1.9%,  xxxg1766xxx  3.9%;
rapid-ii 35-day mortality: reteplase 4.1%,
 xxxg1766xxx  8.4%). in the rapid-i trial, 85.2% of
patients treated with reteplase and 77.2% of
patients treated with  xxxg1766xxx  achieved complete
patency defined as thrombolysis in myocardial
infarction (timi) grade 2 flow at 90 minutes
(p=ns).36 in the rapid-ii trial, the percentage of
patients treated with reteplase or  xxxg1766xxx 
achieving complete patency at 90 minutes was
83.4% and 73.3%, respectively (p=0.03).37 the

results from the rapid trials and the gusto-iii
trial,38 which compared the efficacy and safety of
reteplase with  xxxg1766xxx  in 15,059 patients with
acute myocardial infarction, suggest that
reteplase would be more effective than  xxxg1766xxx 
in restoring normal blood flow to ischemic
tissues after acute myocardial infarction;
however, mortality rates were similar with the
two agents.
the timi-10b trial was designed to compare
the angiographic efficacy and safety of fixed
doses of  xxxd3308xxx  30 or 50 mg as a single
bolus versus front-loaded  xxxg1766xxx  in 886
patients with acute stemi who were seen within
12 hours of symptom onset.39, 41 however, due to
severe bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage, the
50-mg dose was discontinued and substituted
with a 40-mg dose. 39 results showed no
significant difference in 30-day mortality rates
between  xxxd3308xxx  and  xxxg1766xxx , and
 xxxd3308xxx  40 mg and  xxxg1766xxx  produced
similar timi grade 3 flow. in the assessment of
the safety of a new thrombolytic (assent-2)
trial,  xxxd3308xxx  was compared with  xxxg1766xxx  in
16,949 patients with acute myocardial
infarction. 31  xxxd3308xxx  and  xxxg1766xxx  were
associated with equivalent 30-day mortality rates
(6.18% vs 6.15%, respectively). in comparison,
 xxxd3308xxx  resulted in a significant reduction in
the frequency of bleeding complications (26.1%
vs 28.4%, p<0.0003) and blood transfusions
(4.3% vs 5.5%, p=0.0002) compared with
 xxxg1766xxx . the reduction in bleeding with
 xxxd3308xxx  may be explained by its greater
fibrin specificity relative to  xxxg1766xxx ; however,
this remains theoretical and requires further
study.
overall, the decision to use fibrinolytic agents
should be based on an estimate of the patient’s
underlying risk without treatment, risk from
treatment, and benefits from treatment. 4 a

accelerated 90-minute infusion; the latter is the
preferred regimen. 24 the longer half-lives of
reteplase and  xxxd3308xxx  enable bolus administration, which is reported to be more convenient
than an accelerated infusion of  xxxg1766xxx . 42
reteplase is administered as a double-bolus
injection: each injection is completed within 2
minutes, with the two injections given 30
minutes apart. calculation of the total dose does
not require knowledge of the patient’s body
weight. 25  xxxd3308xxx  is administered as a
single-bolus injection given over 5 seconds, and
calculation of the total dose requires knowledge
of the patient’s body weight.26 in the timi-10b
trial, patients who received doses of  xxxd3308xxx 
above 0.55 mg/kg experienced a higher rate of
serious bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage. 43
the  xxxd3308xxx  dose administered was divided
by the weight of the patient to obtain dose/kg.
because of severe bleeding and intracranial
hemorrhage, the 50-mg dose was discontinued
and substituted with the 40-mg dose.39 therefore,
the maximum  xxxd3308xxx  dose should not
exceed 50 mg.
dosing errors may occur due to inaccuracies
in weight estimation when administering
fibrinolytics that require a weight-based dosing
approach. 44 such errors can cause significant
increases in major bleeding and mortality rates in
patients with acute myocardial infarction.45 the
rates of intracranial hemorrhage with the use of
fibrinolytics from the major clinical trials are
presented in table 4. in the gusto-i study,
11.5% of patients received an inaccurate dose of
the 30-day mortality was
 xxxg1766xxx . 43
significantly higher among patients who received
an inaccurate dose of  xxxg1766xxx  compared with
those who received a correct dose (7.7% vs 5.5%,
p<0.001).43 in the assent-2 (in-hospital) and
assent-3 plus (before hospitalization) trials,
approximately 4% and 20% of patients received
an incorrect dose of  xxxd3308xxx , respectively.32, 46

in the assent-3 plus trial, intracranial
hemorrhage occurred in fewer than 1% of
patients who received 95–105% of the correct
dose of  xxxd3308xxx  plus unfractionated heparin
(ufh) compared with 1.73% of those receiving
greater than 105% of the correct dose (p=ns).
although the major concern with fibrinolytic
dosing has been with administration of too high a
dose, the issue of too low a dose and adverse
outcomes has also been raised.43 in dose-ranging
studies with reteplase, less than the recommended dose (10-u bolus followed by another
10-u bolus 30 min later) resulted in lower
infarct-related patency rates. 35 in theory, this
would be a concern with a double-bolus regimen
if administration of the second bolus is
forgotten.43 this seems unlikely, however, as
dosing errors with reteplase have been reported
to be very low, with only 1% of patients not
receiving the full reteplase dose in one study.47
prehospital use
according to the acc-aha 2004 guidelines,
prehospital use of fibrinolysis can be implemented if physicians are present in the
ambulance or if prehospital transport time is
longer than 60 minutes in high-volume
emergency medical service systems. 4 other
factors to consider include the ability to transmit
and interpret ecgs and the level of expertise in
the management of stemi.4 a meta-analysis of
six randomized trials comparing prehospital
versus in-hospital fibrinolysis demonstrated a
17% reduction in all-cause hospital mortality
among patients who received prehospital
fibrinolytic therapy.48 the decreased mortality
can intuitively be explained by the reduction in
time to thrombolysis through a prehospital
administration strategy. in two recently
conducted prehospital trials, the median time
from arrival of the emergency medical service to

the start of thrombolysis was 31 minutes for
reteplase and 33 minutes for  xxxd3308xxx  (table
8). 46, 49 of these studies, assent-3 plus 46
( xxxd3308xxx ) did not evaluate in-hospital
fibrinolysis as a comparator group, and the earlyretavase-thrombolysis in myocardial infarction
(er-timi)-19 trial 49 found that prehospital
administration of reteplase to patients with acute
myocardial infarction reduced the time to
reperfusion by approximately 30 minutes
compared with a traditional in-hospital approach.
adjunctive therapies
in recent clinical trials, several adjunctive

therapies have demonstrated the potential to
improve outcomes with fibrinolytic agents (table
8). 50–55 traditionally, ufh has been the
adjunctive antithrombotic agent of choice.
dosing of ufh is recommended at a bolus dose
of 60 u/kg (maximum 4000 u) and a
maintenance infusion dose of 12 u/kg/hour
(maximum 1000 u/hr) for 48 hours.4 after 48
hours, the decision to continue ufh should be
based on the clinical characteristics of the
patient. in the enoxaparin and thrombolysis
reperfusion for acute myocardial infarction
treatment-thrombolysis in myocardial infarction
(extract-timi)-25 study, enoxaparin, a lowmolecular-weight heparin, was superior to ufh

fibrinolytic agents for stemi management hilleman et al
when used as adjunctive therapy with
fibrinolytics in patients with stemi. 50
enoxaparin was administered as a fixed 30-mg
intravenous bolus, followed 15 minutes later by a
1.0-mg/kg subcutaneous injection, which was
repeated every 12 hours in patients younger than
75 years. patients who were 75 years or older did
not receive the intravenous dose and were given
0.75-mg/kg subcutaneous injections every 12
hours. the primary efficacy end point of death
or nonfatal recurrent myocardial infarction at 30
days occurred in 9.9% of patients in the
enoxaparin group and 12.0% of patients in the
ufh group (17% reduction in relative risk,
p<0.001). myocardial infarction occurred in
3.0% of patients in the enoxaparin group and
4.5% of patients in the ufh group (33%
reduction in relative risk, p<0.001). although no
significant difference was noted in the frequency
of intracranial hemorrhage between patients
receiving enoxaparin or ufh (0.8% vs 0.7%,
p=0.14), the rates of timi major bleeding were
higher for enoxaparin than for ufh (2.1% vs 1.4,
p<0.001).
the assent-3 trial was conducted to evaluate
full-dose  xxxd3308xxx  administered in
combination with enoxaparin, half-dose
 xxxd3308xxx  in combination with  xxxd53xxx  plus
low-dose ufh, or full-dose  xxxd3308xxx  in
combination with full-dose ufh to patients with
stemi in a hospital setting.51 rates of 30-day
mortality, in-hospital reinfarction, and in-hospital
refractory ischemia were 11.4%, 11.1%, and
15.4% in the enoxaparin,  xxxd53xxx , and fulldose ufh groups, respectively. overall, the
frequency of ischemic complications of acute
myocardial infarction was lower with  xxxd3308xxx 
plus enoxaparin or  xxxd53xxx  compared with
 xxxd3308xxx  plus ufh.
the organization for the assessment of
strategies for ischemic syndromes (oasis)-6
trial demonstrated the benefits of fondaparinux, a
 xxxg741xxx  inhibitor. 55 fondaparinux 2.5 mg
once/day was administered subcutaneously for
up to 8 days in patients with stemi. the
primary efficacy end point of death or
reinfarction at 30 days occurred in 11.2% of
patients in the control group and 9.7% in the
fondaparinux group (p=0.008). in addition,
death or reinfarction at 30 days was superior for
fondaparinux compared with ufh (p=0.008).
significant benefits were reported among patients
receiving fondaparinux with reperfusion therapy
compared with patients receiving placebo or ufh
with reperfusion therapy (p=0.003). of

1567

importance, an estimated 45% of patients in this
study received fibrinolytic therapy, thereby
supporting the concomitant use of fondaparinux
with fibrinolytics.
in the clopidogrel as adjunctive reperfusion
therapy-thrombolysis in myocardial infarction
(clarity-timi)-28 study, the addition of
clopidogrel, as  xxxd3426xxx -mg loading dose followed
by 75 mg/day, to aspirin, as a 150–325-mg
loading dose on the first day followed by 75–162
mg/day, plus a standard fibrinolytic regimen
resulted in a 36% reduction in the occurrence of
an occluded infarct-related artery or death or
recurrent myocardial infarction before
angiography (95% confidence interval 24–47%,
p<0.001).52 patients included in this study were
seen within 12 hours of symptom onset of stemi
and were scheduled for angiography 48–192
hours after starting drug therapy. in the
clopidogrel and metoprolol in myocardial
infarction trial (commit), the addition of
clopidogrel to aspirin plus standard therapy, but
not metoprolol to aspirin plus standard therapy,
improved overall outcomes in patients with acute
myocardial infarction. 53, 54 compared with
placebo, addition of clopidogrel produced a 9%
reduction in death, reinfarction, or stroke
(p=0.002) and a 7% reduction in any death
(p=0.03). overall, the results of these trials
support the potential use of certain adjunctive
therapies with fibrinolytics to improve outcomes
in the treatment of patients with stemi.
facilitated and rescue percutaneous coronary
interventions
facilitated pci could provide the advantage of
early pharmacologic reperfusion to increase the
benefit and use of mechanical reperfusion.59 this
technique could theoretically increase the
patency rates before pci.56–58 according to the
acc-aha 2004 guidelines, facilitated pci is a
class iib recommendation and may be performed
in high-risk patients under circumstances when
immediate pci is not available and risk of
bleeding from pharmacologic treatment is low. 4
the pharmacologic regimens for facilitated pci
referred to in the guidelines include a full-dose or
half-dose fibrinolytic; a glycoprotein (gp) iib-iiia
inhibitor; or a combination of a reduced-dose
fibrinolytic and a gp iib-iiia inhibitor. 4
however, a recent meta-analysis showed less
favorable outcomes, including higher mortality
and nonfatal reinfarction rates, with facilitated
pci versus primary pci. 60 this meta-analysis

1568

pharmacotherapy volume 27, number 11, 2007

included 17 trials involving patients with stemi
who were assigned to either facilitated or primary
pci. pharmacologic intervention included fulldose fibrinolytics, reduced-dose fibrinolytics,
high-dose heparin, gp iib-iiia inhibitors, or a
combination of gp iib-iiia inhibitors and
reduced-dose fibrinolytics. the results of the
analysis indicated that facilitated pci did not
offer any advantage over primary pci. however,
a large percentage of patients included in the
analysis for facilitated pci were from the
assent-4 trial, which was terminated early; the
study’s data and safety monitoring board
reported significant increases in adverse events
(strokes, ischemic cardiac complications, inhospital mortality) within 90 days of treatment
with full-dose  xxxd3308xxx  and pci by 1–3
hours.56 in addition, this meta-analysis included
heterogeneous studies with differences in clinical
end points, time from pretreatment to pci, and
dosing regimens, which may have affected the
generalizability of the findings.
a recent, prospective, single-center, cohort
study involving 254 patients with stemi
reported a significant reduction in the rate of
major adverse cardiac end points (p=0.021) and
higher timi 3 flow rates among patients treated
with facilitated pci compared with primary
pci.57 in addition, no significant difference was
noted between facilitated pci and primary pci in
terms of bleeding complications (p=0.66).
patients received either a half dose of reteplase
(62.2%), a full dose of reteplase (7.9%), another
fibrinolytic agent (6.3%), and/or a gp iib-iiia
inhibitor (76.4%) followed by facilitated pci or
primary pci without drug treatment. overall,
the study concluded greater treatment
effectiveness and cost savings with facilitated pci
versus primary pci. large, multicenter,
randomized trials are required to confirm these
findings.
another study that investigated the benefits of
immediate pci (< 2 hrs) or delayed facilitated
pci (12–70 hrs) reported similar results for
ejection fraction, creatine kinase release, and
patency of the infarct-related artery with both
approaches.58 furthermore, delayed facilitated
pci resulted in a significant reduction in
ischemic events (p=0.005), restenosis (p=0.01),
bleeding (p=0.01), and angiographic thrombus
formation (p=0.001) compared with immediate
facilitated pci. both groups received the same
pharmacologic treatment ( xxxg1766xxx  50 mg with
gp iib-iiia inhibitors). randomized studies with
a variety of pharmacologic agents are warranted

to verify the beneficial effects of facilitated pci in
patients with stemi.
the ongoing facilitated intervention with
enhanced reperfusion speed to stop events
(finesse) study, which is investigating half-dose
reteplase (two 5-u injections given 30 min apart)
in combination with  xxxd53xxx  in facilitated pci
versus primary pci, will provide better insights
into the benefits of facilitated pci with reduceddose reteplase.61 the study will include 3000
patients arriving for treatment within 6 hours of
onset of symptoms of acute myocardial
infarction, and will also test a new regimen of
reteplase (5-u single bolus) in combination with
 xxxd53xxx  in patients aged 75 years or older.
another strategy, known as rescue pci, may
provide significant benefit in improving
reperfusion and survival after ineffective
reperfusion with fibrinolytics.62 in the acc-aha
2004 guidelines, rescue pci was defined as pci
performed within 12 hours after failure of
fibrinolytic therapy for patients with continuing
or recurrent stemi.4 no significant differences
were reported in procedural success rates for
patients treated with rescue pci versus primary
pci in a study of 659 patients with stemi
arriving within 12 hours of symptom onset. in
addition, rescue pci did not increase the risk of
major bleeding complications or major adverse
cardiac end points compared with primary pci.63
conclusion
the overarching treatment goal for patients
with stemi is to shorten the total ischemic time
as much as possible by providing prompt
reperfusion. fibrinolytic agents are the preferred
pharmacologic class for the treatment of stemi
because of their ability to achieve reperfusion and
to restore blood flow when administered within
12 hours of symptom onset. currently, three
recombinant analogs of tissue plasminogen
activator— xxxg1766xxx , reteplase, and  xxxd3308xxx —
are approved for use in the united states. all
three agents improve survival in patients with
stemi. the mortality benefits and safety
characteristics are similar among the three
agents. both  xxxd3308xxx  and reteplase offer the
convenience of bolus dosing. accurate dosing,
adjunctive therapies, and risk-versus-benefit
analysis based on an individual patient’s profile
are important factors for physicians and
pharmacists to consider when choosing a drug
therapy to provide the most favorable patient
outcomes. knowledge regarding the fibrinolytics

fibrinolytic agents for stemi management hilleman et al
and their place in the acc-aha guidelines will
help these clinicians select the optimal agents for
the treatment of patients with stemi.
