with the 1420 cc genotype, significant increased
hcy levels are present. also, significantly decreased
red blood cell folate and plasma folate levels were
present in individuals with the 1420 cc genotype.
probably, the 1420 c>t polymorphism causes a
shift in distribution of the different folate derivatives. the 4-bp deletion of the mshmt gene did not
lead to altered hcy or folate levels. so far, the results of this study provide no direct evidence for a
role of defective  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  functioning in ntd. still,
the influence of the 1420 c>t polymorphism of the
 xxxg2068xxx  gene on the folate-related risk of ntd needs
further investigation. © 2001 academic press

neural tube defects (ntd) arise in the first weeks
of pregnancy due to a combination of environmental and genetic factors. in mothers of children with
ntd elevated homocysteine (hcy) levels and decreased plasma folate levels were observed, which
suggests a defect in the folate-dependent hcy metabolism. therefore, mutations in genes coding for
enzymes of this metabolism could be involved in
ntd. serine hydroxymethyltransferase ( xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx )
catalyzes the reversible reaction of serine and  xxxd3334xxx  ( xxxd3334xxx ) to glycine and 5,10-methylene
 xxxd3334xxx . two different isoforms of  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  are known,
one is present in the cytosol ( xxxg2068xxx ) and the other
in the mitochondrion (mshmt). theoretically, mutated  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  could lead to elevated hcy levels and to
an altered distribution of the different folate derivatives and might therefore become a risk factor for
ntd. this study concerns the molecular genetic
analysis of genes coding for both isoforms of the
 xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  enzyme by single-stranded conformation
polymorphism analysis. several mutations as well
as polymorphisms were found in both genes. the
relevance of two variations, the 1420 c>t mutation
of the cytosolic isoform and the 4-bp deletion of the
mitochondrial isoform (deltctt 1721–1724), to ntd
risk was tested in a study group, which consisted of
109 ntd patients, 120 mothers of children with
ntd, and 420 controls. neither of the two polymorphisms led to an increased risk of ntd. in mothers

neural tube defects (ntd) are congenital malformations, which arise during the first weeks of pregnancy, due to incomplete closure of the neural tube.
ntd are considered to be the result of a combination
of environmental and genetic factors. periconceptional folate administration reduces the ntd birth
prevalence about 70% (1,2). mothers of children with
ntd are not folate deficient but have folate levels in
the lower range of the controls (3–5). furthermore,
elevated homocysteine (hcy) levels were observed in
these mothers, suggesting an abnormal folate metabolism (4 – 6). hcy is a sulfur-containing metabolite, which is formed by demethylation of the essential amino acid methionine. subsequently, hcy can
be irreversibly degraded by cystathionine ␤-synthase (cbs) or it can be remethylated to methionine

by  xxxg1479xxx  (ms) or betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase ( xxxg262xxx ) (fig. 1). mutations
in genes coding for these enzymes might be involved
in the etiology of ntd. some years ago, the first
genetic risk factor for ntd was identified by our
group in the gene coding for  xxxg1475xxx  ( xxxg1475xxx ), the 677 c⬎t polymorphism (a222v) (7). in dutch and irish populations,
this 677 c⬎t polymorphism is associated with a 2to 4-fold increased risk for ntd and results in elevated plasma hcy levels and lowered plasma folate
levels (7–9). recently, we identified a possible second genetic risk factor for ntd, the 1298 a⬎c polymorphism of the  xxxg1475xxx  gene (10,11). besides
 xxxg1475xxx , genes coding for enzymes of the remethy-

lation or transsulfuration pathway of hcy metabolism could play a role in the etiology of ntd. in ms,
a common polymorphism was found (d919g), which
is not a major risk factor for ntd or hyperhomocysteinemia (hhcy) (12,13). in addition, a polymorphism in the methionine-synthase reductase gene
( xxxg1480xxx , i22m) has been shown to be associated with
increased risk for ntd in combination with low
cobalamin levels (14). enzymatic and molecular genetic studies of cbs did not indicate a major role of
the cbs gene in ntd etiology (4,15). recently, we
investigated  xxxg262xxx  in relation to mild hhcy, and
this enzyme does not seem to influence hcy metabolism at least not in cardiovascular disease (16). in
addition, deficiencies of methylenetetrahydrofolate

dehydrogenase ( xxxg1473xxx ) or serine hydroxymethyltransferase ( xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx ) might be involved in ntd etiology (fig. 1). molecular genetic analysis of the gene
coding for the trifunctional enzyme  xxxg1473xxx  did not
indicate an involvement of this gene in ntd etiology
(17).
 xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  ( xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx ) is a major entry point for onecarbon units from serine into folate-dependent metabolism and might therefore be a possible candidate to be involved in ntd.  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  is a pyridoxal
phosphate-dependent enzyme, which catalyzes the
reversible conversion of serine and  xxxd3334xxx 
( xxxd3334xxx ) to glycine and 5,10-methylene  xxxd3334xxx  (5,10methf) (fig. 1) (18,19). in humans  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  is
present as two iso-enzymes, one located in the mitochondrion (mshmt) and the other in the cytoplasm
( xxxg2068xxx ) (18,19). it has been suggested that  xxxg2068xxx 
favors the reaction of 5,10-methf and glycine to
 xxxd3334xxx  and serine, whereas mshmt might catalyze
the opposite reaction (19). however, a recent in vivo
study on one-carbon metabolism provides evidence
that  xxxg2068xxx  can operate in both directions (20). in
the early nineties garrow et al. cloned the genes
coding for the human isoforms of  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  (21) and
several years later the genomic sequences of both
genes were published (22,23). the  xxxg2068xxx  gene is
localized to chromosome 17p11.2, whereas the
mshmt gene is localized to chromosome 12q13.2.
the  xxxg2068xxx  gene consists of 12 exons and 12 introns
and is alternatively spliced in human cells (23). in
addition, a pseudogene with 93% sequence identity
with the  xxxg2068xxx  has been identified (24). this
 xxxg2068xxx -derived pseudogene is localized to chromosome 1. the gene coding for mshmt consists of 10
exons and 10 introns (22). both  xxxg2068xxx  and
mshmt share about 63% sequence identity and
mshmt shows 61% sequence identity with the
 xxxg2068xxx -derived pseudogene (21).
in the present study, we describe the molecular
genetic analysis of both isoforms of human  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  in
relation to ntd in combination with hcy and folate
levels.

from 317 controls recruited from a general practice
in the hague was used (12,25). in addition to this
first study group, material from a second case/control study group was included consisting of 39 sb
patients (mean age 10.6 ⫾ 4.1 years), 47 mothers of
children with sb (mean age 38.6 ⫾ 5.1 years), and
103 healthy hospital employees (mean age 36.6 ⫾
5.0 years) (26). the exclusion criteria of these 103
controls were overt liver and renal dysfunction, hormonal therapy, neoplastic disease, cleft lip, ntd,
and the use of vitamins. the local ethics committee
approved this study.
rna/dna isolation and cdna synthesis
rna was isolated from cultured lymphoblasts as
described (27). isolated rna was dnase-treated to
eliminate genomic dna contamination followed by
reversed transcription to cdna by standard techniques. furthermore, reverse transcriptase was
omitted from at least one rna sample to check for
possible dna contamination. in addition, dna was
isolated from whole blood according to miller et al.
(28).
molecular genetic analysis

patients and controls

both human  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  iso-enzymes were subjected to
single stranded conformation polymorphism (sscp)
(29). therefore, primers were designed according to
genbank published  xxxg2068xxx  and mshmt mrna
sequences (accession nos. l23928 and nm_005412,
respectively and table 1) resulting in overlapping
pcr fragments of ⬃250 bp. due to the presence of a
pseudogene for the  xxxg2068xxx  with a homology of 93%
in mrna sequence, primers were designed to eliminate pseudogene amplification, which was confirmed by sequencing analysis on an abi 377 automated sequencer using the dyedeoxy terminator
cycle sequencing kit according to instructions of the
manufacturer (pe biosystems, the netherlands).
pcr was carried out in a total volume of 25 ␮l on an
omnigene thermocycler (biozym, the netherlands),
containing 50 ng of both primers, 200 mm dntps, 10
mm tris 䡠 hcl buffer, 1.0 –2.0 mm mgcl 2, and 0.5
unit taq polymerase (all from life technologies,
the netherlands). sscp was performed as described previously (17,26).

the study group, which was recruited by the participation of the dutch society for patients with central nervous system (cns) defects (bosk), consisted of spina bifida (sb) patients (n ⫽ 70) and their
mothers (n ⫽ 73) (7). as a control group, material

cytosolic  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx . in the coding region of the human cytosolic  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  gene two sequence variations
were found by sscp. the first one, the 1181 g⬎a
transition, was confirmed at the dna level by restriction enzyme analysis. this mutation resulted in

enzyme analysis. pcr products were generated by
primer 8-for and 8-rev, thereby creating a product of

found by sscp in the coding region, the 850 c⬎t

pcr using primer 850-for and 850-rev (table 1)
followed by ncil restriction enzyme analysis. pcr
products containing exon 7 of 208 bp in length were
obtained, which were cut by ncil in two fragments of
123 and 85 bp, when the wild type was present. the
products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. furthermore, in the 3⬘-untranslated region (utr) a
4-bp deletion was found at positions 1721–1724 of

the mrna. this deletion was screened by pcr using primer del-for and del-rev (table 1). subsequently, pcr products were separated on a 20%
paa gel for 5 h at 140 v, followed by ethidium
bromide staining for 15 min.
hcy and folate analysis
hcy levels from 107 patients, 120 mothers, and
410 controls of the total study group were measured
in edta plasma by hplc (30). plasma folate as
well as red blood cell (rbc) folate was measured by
dualcount solid phase boil radio-/assay (diagnostic
procedures, u.s.a.) (31). plasma folate levels were
obtained from 90 patients and 116 mothers, and
only from 103 controls of the second study group.
rbc folate levels were obtained from 87 patients
and 113 mothers, and only from 103 controls of the

genotypes was estimated by one-way analysis of
variance (anova) and student’s t test. tests for
linear trend were performed by linear regression

for the 1181 g⬎a transition. material of the father
was not available.
the second variation found in this gene was located in exon 13, which is the last exon of this gene.
this 1420 c⬎t transition results in an amino acid
substitution of leucine to phenylalanine at position
474 of the protein (l474f). to test whether this
sequence variation contributes to the risk for ntd,
we screened all controls and also the mothers of
these patients, because a disturbed folate metabolism of the mother could also contribute to the risk of
giving birth to a child with ntd (31). this 1420 c⬎t
polymorphism does not lead to an increased risk for
ntd (table 3). the effect of this polymorphism on
hcy was investigated in the total study group. mothers with 1420 cc genotype show significantly higher
hcy levels compared to those with the 1420 ct
genotype. hcy levels of other groups did not differ
between the different genotypes (table 4). additionally, folate levels were measured in material of patients and mothers and only in a subset of the controls, namely the 103 controls of the second study
group. these folate levels were investigated in relation to the 1420 c⬎t polymorphism, and rbc
folate as well as plasma folate levels are significantly elevated due to presence of the 1420 c⬎t
substitution (tables 5 and 6, all individuals anova

mitochondrial  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx 
two sequence variations were found by sscp of
the gene coding for the mshmt isoform (table
2).the first mutation was found homozygously in
one of the 70 ntd patients. this 850 c⬎t transition
leads to an amino acid substitution of arginine to
tryptophan at position 284 of the protein (r284w).
screening of 400 control alleles did not reveal any
other mutant alleles, meaning that this 850 c⬎t
transition is not a general risk factor for ntd. the
mother and father of this ntd patient were
screened, and both parents are heterozygous for this
850 c⬎t mutation (data not shown). in the 3⬘-utr,
a second mutation was found concerning a 4-bp deletion at position 1721 (deltctt 1721–1724). this
deletion was heterozygously present in 4 ntd patients. to study whether this deletion contributes to
the folate related risk of ntd, this deletion was
evaluated in the entire study group, which consists
of 109 cases, 120 mothers, and 420 controls. this
deletion had an allele frequency of 0.027 in the controls and its frequency was not significantly different in patients or mothers (table 3), assuming that
this deletion is not involved in ntd. furthermore,
hcy levels and folate levels were not altered due to
the presence of this deleted allele (tables 4, 5, and
6). finally, a nonsense mutation, the 906 t⬎g substitution was observed in one ntd patient (table 3).

discussion
defective functioning of  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  could contribute
to the risk for ntd. this study concerns the molecular genetic analysis of cdna of two genes coding for the mitochondrial and cytosolic isoform of
 xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx . two sequence variations were found in the
coding region of the  xxxg2068xxx  gene, the 1181 g⬎a
transition and the 1420 c⬎t transition. the 1181
g⬎a mutation was found heterozygously in one
ntd patient and therefore is not a general risk
factor for ntd. the second variation found in this
gene, the 1420 c⬎t transition, had an allele frequency of 0.268 for the t-allele in patients. this
polymorphism did not result in an increased risk
of ntd. mothers with the wild-type genotype
(1420 cc) have higher hcy levels. however, these
higher hcy levels were not observed in patients or
controls. significantly decreased rbc folate levels
as well as plasma folate levels were observed in
individuals with the wild-type genotype (1420
cc). probably, the 1420 c⬎t transition in the
 xxxg2068xxx  gene alters the distribution of folates in
red blood cells and in plasma, which is reflected for
the wild type by increased hcy levels in mothers
and decreased folate levels. although, more data
are needed to assess a possible influence of this
polymorphism on folate metabolism and ntd risk.
alternative splicing of exon 9 was present on rna

171

is mutated  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  involved in ntd?

of lymphoblastoid cells in all patients (data not
shown). this alternative splicing was already reported by girgis et al. (23), who observed a cellspecific alternative splicing of exon 9, as well as
exons 2 and 10. as postulated by girgis et al. alternative splicing might influence catalytic activity of
 xxxg2068xxx , serine cleavage, and synthesis of different
folate derivatives (23). recently, a study on the kinetics of human one-carbon metabolism provides evidence that folate metabolism in the overall whole
body differs from that of the liver (20). this result is
consistent with the reported cell-specific alternative
splicing of the  xxxg2068xxx  gene (23). however, further
studies are required to assess a possible influence of
this alternative splicing event on hcy and folate
metabolism.
in the mshmt gene two variations were found.
the first one, the 850 c⬎t substitution, is found as
a homozygous mutation in one patient and therefore
this mutation is not a common risk factor for ntd.
the second variation found in this gene is a 4-bp
deletion in the 3⬘-utr of this gene. sequence variations located in the 3⬘-utr might cause variable
expression and might disrupt rna stability. this
deltctt 1721–1724 did not contribute to an increased risk for ntd. furthermore, presence of the
deleted allele did also not result in elevated hcy
levels or altered folate levels. therefore, this deletion does not seem to contribute to the risk for ntd.
although, due to the very low allele frequency, more
data are needed to assess a possible relationship of
this deletion to ntd risk.
thus far, the results of this study show that the
1420 c⬎t polymorphism of the  xxxg2068xxx  might contribute to a disturbed folate-dependent hcy metabolism but more data are needed to study this effect.
a redistribution of folates due to the 1420 c⬎t
polymorphism in the  xxxg2068xxx  gene may occur, but
whether this polymorphism really influences  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx 
activity cannot be concluded from this study. expression of  xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  mutations in a bacterial expression system might evaluate any possible effects on
 xxxg2068xxx   xxxg2069xxx  activity (32). the complex mechanism behind
the genetic and environmental interaction, which is
involved in ntd, is far from solved and will require
several more years of research.
