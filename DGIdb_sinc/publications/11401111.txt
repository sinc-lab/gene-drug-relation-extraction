we sought to assess plasma concentrations of the amino (n)-terminal portion of pro-brain
natriuretic peptide (n-bnp) and  xxxg80xxx  for prediction of adverse outcomes and
responses to treatment in 297 patients with ischemic left ventricular (lv) dysfunction who
were randomly assigned to receive carvedilol or placebo.
background although neurohormonal status has known prognostic significance in heart failure, the
predictive power of either n-bnp or  xxxg80xxx  in chronic ischemic lv dysfunction has
not been previously reported.
methods
plasma n-bnp and  xxxg80xxx  were measured in 297 patients with chronic ischemic
(lv) dysfunction before randomization to carvedilol or placebo, added to established
treatment with a converting enzyme inhibitor and loop diuretic (with or without digoxin).
the patients’ clinical outcomes, including mortality and heart failure events, were recorded for
18 months.
results
above-median n-bnp and  xxxg80xxx  levels conferred increased risks (all p ⬍ 0.001)
of mortality (risk ratios [95% confidence intervals]: 4.67 [2–10.9] and 3.92 [1.76 – 8.7],
respectively) and hospital admission with heart failure (4.7 [2.2–10.3] and 2.4 [1.3– 4.5],
respectively). both of these predicted death or heart failure independent of age, new york
heart association functional class, lv ejection fraction, previous myocardial infarction or
previous admission with heart failure. carvedilol reduced the risk of death or heart failure in
patients with above-median levels of n-bnp or  xxxg80xxx , or both, to rates not
significantly different from those observed in patients with levels below the median value.
conclusions in patients with established ischemic lv dysfunction, plasma n-bnp and  xxxg80xxx 
are independent predictors of mortality and heart failure. carvedilol reduced mortality
and heart failure in patients with higher pre-treatment plasma n-bnp and  xxxg80xxx .

objectives

neurohormonal responses to cardiac impairment participate
in the pathogenesis of heart failure (1– 4). plasma levels of
neurohormonal factors offer an indication of cardiovascular
prognosis (1,4 – 6) and can assist in the prediction of benefit
from treatment. the cardiac peptide called brain natriuretic
peptide (bnp) has received close attention as a cardiovascular marker (5,7–9). we have recently reported that the
76-amino acid residue amino (n)-terminal portion of probnp (n-bnp) circulates in human plasma (10) and that
levels are elevated in cardiac impairment (10,11). in normal
subjects, mean plasma concentrations are similar to those of
bnp (⬃10 pmol/liter), whereas in cardiac impairment,
proportional and absolute increments above normal levels of
n-bnp exceed those for bnp, suggesting that it may be the
more discerning marker. we have demonstrated n-bnp to

be an independent prognostic marker of mortality or decompensated heart failure after myocardial infarction (mi)
(12).
 xxxg80xxx  is a 52-amino acid peptide originally
isolated from pheochromocytoma cells (13). it has been
detected in a range of tissues, including the heart, vasculature, kidney, adrenal medulla, lung, and brain (14). in
experimental heart failure,  xxxg80xxx  expression is
increased and peptide levels rise, and administered peptide
has powerful vasodilator effects, increases cardiac output and
is natriuretic (15,16). plasma concentrations are in the low
picomolar range in healthy individuals, but they increase in
those with hypertension and congestive heart failure (chf)
in proportion to the severity of the disease (17). in heart
failure, plasma  xxxg80xxx  is inversely related to left
ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) and is positively associated with left ventricular (lv) end-diastolic pressure
(18,19). at least two reports have indicated that plasma
 xxxg80xxx  levels act as an indicator of prognosis after
acute mi (12,20).
there are no published data relating plasma concentrations of either n-bnp or  xxxg80xxx  to cardiovascular

prognosis in patients with established ischemic lv dysfunction. we hypothesized that plasma levels of either or both
peptides would have independent prognostic utility in such
patients and also assist in predicting any benefit from
treatment with carvedilol. we report the results from 297
patients with ischemic lv impairment who were randomly
assigned to treatment with carvedilol or placebo for chf.

methods
the organization of the study and the effects of carvedilol
on lv function, exercise tolerance, symptoms and morbidity and mortality rates have been reported (21,22). twenty
centers in australia and new zealand participated (see
appendix). the study was coordinated by the clinical
trials research unit, university of auckland, new zealand. neurohormonal assays and related analyses were
conducted by the christchurch cardioendocrine research
group, christchurch school of medicine, christchurch,
new zealand. the study protocol was approved by the
ethics committee at each participating center. all patients
provided written, informed consent.
patients (n ⫽ 415) were recruited with chronic, stable
heart failure caused by ischemic heart disease, lvef ⬍45%
(measured by radionuclide ventriculography), and current
new york heart association (nyha) functional class ii
or iii or previous functional class ii–iv. exclusion
criteria included current functional class iv, heart rate
⬍50 beats/min, sick sinus syndrome, second- or third-degree
heart block, blood pressure ⬍90 mm hg systolic or
⬎160/100 mm hg diastolic, treadmill exercise duration ⬍2
or ⬎18 min (modified naughton protocol), coronary event
or procedure within four weeks, primary myocardial or valve
disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, chronic airways disease,
hepatic disease (serum transaminase ⬎3 times normal),
renal impairment (creatinine ⬎250 ␮mol/liter) and lifethreatening noncardiac disease or current treatment with a
beta-blocker, beta-agonist or verapamil.
patients tolerating 6.25 mg of carvedilol twice daily were
randomly assigned, in a double-blinded manner, to receive
continued carvedilol (titrated to a maximal dose of 25 mg

jacc vol. 37, no. 7, 2001

twice daily) or matching placebo for a trial period of 18
months.
the study outcomes included all-cause mortality, death
from worsening heart failure, episodes of worsening heart
failure (defined as deterioration requiring an increase in
nonstudy antiheart failure treatments, an increase in nyha
functional class, hospital admission for worsening symptoms
of heart failure or nonsudden death from progressive heart
failure), hospital admission for worsening heart failure and
hospital admission for acute coronary syndromes.
neurohormonal sampling was conducted before randomization. venous blood (edta) was collected (9 am–
12 pm) after intravenous cannulation of the patient, who
had been seated for 30 min. the sample was separated
within 20 min, and the plasma was stored at ⫺80°c before
transport, on dry ice, to the laboratory for assay. assays for
n-bnp and  xxxg80xxx  were conducted according to
our published methods (11,23). inter-assay and intra-assay
coefficients of variation fell within the range of 5% to 9%.
statistics. event rates were compared by chi-square tests,
with risk ratios (rrs) (95% confidence intervals [cis]), and
kaplan-meier curves calculated for groups with hospital
admission levels above and below the group median of
individual neurohormonal factors and lvef. analyses were
conducted separately for groups randomized to receive
carvedilol and placebo, as well as for the total patient group.
cox proportional hazards analysis was used to study the two
peptides and other potential indicators (e.g., treatment,
nyha functional class, lvef, age, previous mi, previous
hospital admission for heart failure), as well as the interaction of n-bnp with treatment (i.e., placebo or carvedilol),
or  xxxg80xxx  with treatment, or both, for independent
prediction of clinical outcomes. the value p ⬍ 0.05 (twotailed) indicated statistical significance.

results
seventy percent of the patients were in nyha functional
class ii or iii and 30% were in class i at randomization (43%
had previously been in class iv at some time). eighty-eight
percent had a previous mi, and 43% had a previous hospital
admission for heart failure. eight-five percent were receiving an  xxxg36xxx  (ace) inhibitor;
75% took diuretics; and 38% took digoxin. the average
lvef at entry was 29%.
the effects of treatment on morbidity and mortality and
the surrogate end points have been reported (21,22). carvedilol improved lvef without deterioration in symptoms or
exercise capacity. the combined end point of death or
hospital admission for any reason was reduced by 26% (104
patients receiving carvedilol vs. 131 patients receiving placebo; 95% ci ⫺43% to ⫺5%; 2p ⫽ 0.02). we have also
previously reported important interactions between prerandomization plasma levels of other hormones and the
response to carvedilol (24). carvedilol reduced mortality

after our initial neurohormonal substudy (24), sufficient
plasma (edta) stored appropriately (⫺80°c) remained
available for measurements of n-bnp and  xxxg80xxx 
in 297 (72%) of the original 415 study participants. a
comparison of these 297 subjects with the remaining 118
subjects revealed no statistically significant differences in any
demographic, lv imaging, functional or neurohormonal

hence, findings within this majority subgroup (72%) are

table 1 indicates event rates for the designated study
outcomes according to median levels of n-bnp,  xxxg80xxx  and lvef. pre-randomization plasma levels
of either peptide that fell above the median value for the
group were more powerfully predictive than lvef and
indicated a significantly increased risk (irrespective of
whether carvedilol or placebo was subsequently administered) for all-cause mortality, death due to chf, hospital
admission due to heart failure and worsening heart failure,
but not for hospital admission due to a new acute coronary
syndrome. kaplan-meier analyses corroborated these findings, with examples given in figures 1 and 2 illustrating
significant separation of event-free survival curves for allcause mortality (fig. 1) and hospital admission due to
worsening heart failure (fig. 2).

cated that, of the eight putative predictors, both n-bnp
and  xxxg80xxx  were significant predictors of all outcomes (with the exception of hospital admission with an
acute coronary syndrome), independent of treatment,

for the prospectively defined end points of all-cause mortality (n ⫽ 35), death from chf (n ⫽ 24), admission with

a key interaction is illustrated in figure 3, where eventfree survival curves for hospital admission with cardiac
failure are shown for patients with pre-randomization
n-bnp and  xxxg80xxx  levels above and below the
median value, subclassified according to allocation to the

discussion
the current study is the first to demonstrate, to the best of
our knowledge, the ability of plasma concentrations of
n-bnp and  xxxg80xxx  to independently predict allcause mortality and heart failure in patients with established
ischemic lv dysfunction. both peptides had greater predictive power for mortality and heart failure, compared with

lvef, whether considered in univariate (table 1) or
multivariate analyses. furthermore, this is the first report of
the ability of these peptides to predict benefit from treatment with carvedilol.
carvedilol and n-bnp in heart failure. recent trials of
carvedilol and other beta-blockers in heart failure indicate
that these are an important advance in therapy for a
common lethal condition (21,22,25–27). however, appropriate patient selection and prediction of benefit remain
uncertain. the current report extends our previous demonstration of prediction of benefit from carvedilol in those
patients with higher pre-treatment plasma bnp levels, but
lesser activation of norepinephrine (24). plasma bnp and

n-bnp are very closely (r ⱖ 0.90) correlated (12), and the
current report indicates that n-bnp is a comparable or
better prognostic marker than bnp, which was superior to
atrial natriuretic peptide (anp), plasma catecholamines and
 xxxd3495xxx  in the australia-new zealand heart
failure study cohort (24). n-terminal bnp circulates at
higher levels than its c-terminal congener, has a longer
half-life and is less likely to be perturbed by acute stimuli.
plasma levels of n-bnp rise more steeply for a given degree
of cardiac impairment, compared with bnp. for these
reasons, n-bnp may be somewhat more reliable than
bnp-32 as a prognostic marker. plasma n-bnp and its
c-terminal congener are derived from lv secretion in
response to ventricular wall stress. it is therefore not
surprising that these levels are more closely related to
concurrent lv function and prognosis, compared with
other circulating neurohormonal markers.
the mechanism underlying the predictive power of
n-bnp for a benefit from carvedilol is unknown. betablockers may downregulate natriuretic peptide clearance
receptors (28), and it is possible that some of the benefit
from carvedilol is derived from enhancing plasma anp or
bnp levels, or both, with promotion of natriuresis, vasodilation and relative suppression of the sympathetic and
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems. beta-blockerinduced enhancement of natriuretic peptide levels may be
proportional to baseline peptide concentrations. hence, the
relationship between pre-treatment n-bnp and the likelihood of benefit from carvedilol may simply reflect its close
correlation with the bioactive species bnp and, to a lesser
extent, anp.
 xxxg80xxx  in heart failure. in contrast to the cardiac peptides, plasma  xxxg80xxx  has a multi-tissue

origin, being derived not only from the vasculature and
heart but also from other organs (14). hence, the mechanisms underlying its relationship to cardiac function and
cardiovascular prognosis are less obvious. however, cardiac
expression of  xxxg80xxx  is increased in experimental
ischemic heart failure (29), and tsuruda et al. (30) have
demonstrated enhanced  xxxg80xxx  production by mechanical stretching of cultured cardiomyocytes. hence, it is
possible that with progressive cardiac impairment, plasma
 xxxg80xxx  is progressively more reflective of cardiac
production of the peptide. alternatively (or in addition),
peripheral and cardiac production of  xxxg80xxx  may
rise in parallel as heart failure progresses, explaining the
relationship of venous plasma concentrations of  xxxg80xxx  with cardiac function and prognosis. stimuli
shown to augment  xxxg80xxx  production from vascular cells in vitro, which may be present at elevated tissue or
plasma levels in heart failure, include interleukin-1, tumor
necrosis factor,  xxxg99xxx , endothelin i, adrenaline and
aldosterone (31). however, it remains unclear why plasma
 xxxg80xxx  levels should be predictive of a benefit from
carvedilol.
notably, a reduction in hospital admissions for heart
failure in patients with high peptide levels receiving carvedilol was not apparent until 300 days after randomization.
before this point, the events tended to be more frequent in
this subgroup (fig. 3). the current data do not have
sufficient power to formally assess for significant crossover of
the survival curves. however, the possibility of early adverse
effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on heart failure admissions of patients with neurohormonal activation cannot be
ruled out. in our previous report in the australia-new
zealand heart failure neurohormonal substudy (24), the

1786

richards et al.
 xxxg80xxx  and n-bnp in chronic chf

same finding was apparent for c-terminal bnp with respect
to hospital admission with heart failure, but not for all-cause
mortality. hence, if a genuine, slight excess of early heart
failure events is triggered by carvedilol in this high-risk
neurohormonal group, it is not at the cost of concurrent,
early, increased mortality.
other markers in heart failure. the current data extend
our previous findings (24) relating pre-treatment neurohormonal status with response to carvedilol. previous reports
have related neurohormonal status and response with converting enzyme inhibition. swedberg et al. (32) reported
that the mortality benefit from enalapril in patients with
nyha functional class iv heart failure was enhanced in
those with plasma catecholamines,  xxxg99xxx , aldosterone and anp levels above the group median value. in the
survival and ventricular enlargement (save) trial (33),
plasma renin activity predicted an increased efficacy of
captopril in reducing one-year mortality rates, and enalapril
gave greater survival benefit in patients with higher norepinephrine and renin levels in the vasodilator heart failure
trial (v-heft ii) (4). the relationship of neurohormonal
status with treatment effects on rates of worsening heart
failure was not addressed in that report. the cooperative
north scandinavian enalapril survival study (consensus), save and v-heft ii did not provide data on bnp,
n-bnp or  xxxg80xxx . therefore, available reports
indicate that elevated pre-treatment renin, norepinephrine
and cardiac peptide levels are positively associated with a
benefit from ace inhibitor therapy in heart failure. the
current report indicates that n-bnp and  xxxg80xxx 
should be added to anp and bnp as positive predictors of
benefit when a beta-blocker is added.
the conditions of the current study preclude conclusions
about whether or not plasma n-bnp or  xxxg80xxx 
could predict a benefit from beta-blockers, without a previous introduction of ace inhibitor treatment, or from
other antiheart failure therapies (e.g., endopeptidase inhibitors,  xxxg99xxx  receptor blockers, endothelin antagonists), and these questions should be addressed in future
randomized trials of heart failure therapy. furthermore, our
results cannot be extended to other patient populations.
subgroup analyses entail a loss of statistical power and
generate hypotheses rather than conclusive findings. the
current report requires confirmation. the relative (or potential complementary) strength of n-bnp and  xxxg80xxx  compared with (or combined with) other
circulating markers of cardiac dysfunction (the interleukins,
for example), which were not measured in our study, cannot
be assessed in this report.
conclusions. the current findings indicate that plasma
n-bnp and  xxxg80xxx  levels in patients with established ischemic lv dysfunction receiving standard therapy
with ace inhibitors and loop diuretics (with or without
digoxin) are independently predictive of mortality and heart
failure. elevated plasma levels of both of these peptides
predict a long-term benefit from introduction of carvedilol.
