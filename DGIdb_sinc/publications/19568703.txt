abstract
 xxxd3078xxx  is a tricyclic synthetic analog of
melatonin that acts speciﬁcally on mt 1 and
mt 2 melatonin receptors.  xxxd3078xxx ’s halflife is longer than that of melatonin, being
metabolized in the body to four main metabolites, m-i, m-ii, m-iii, and m-iv. m-ii has an

afﬁnity to mt1 and mt2 of about one-tenth of
the parent compound, but its concentration in
the circulation exceeds that of  xxxd3078xxx  by
more than an order of magnitude.  xxxd3078xxx 
is effective in decreasing latency to persistent
sleep and increasing total sleep time in freely
moving monkeys. a number of clinical studies have been undertaken to study the efﬁcacy
of  xxxd3078xxx  in subjects with chronic insomnia. in almost all of these studies,  xxxd3078xxx ,
in various doses of 4, 8, or 16 mg most commonly, significantly reduced sleep latency
and increased sleep duration. its primary
action in sleep promotion is not a generalized
gamma-aminobutyric (gaba)-ergic central nervous system depression, but rather it acts as a
melatonergic agonist in the suprachiasmatic
nucleus (and at other central nervous system sites), from where downstream processes,
including gaba-ergic effects, are controlled via
the hypothalamic sleep switch. unlike other
commonly prescribed hypnotic drugs,  xxxd3078xxx  is not associated with next morning hangover effects or reductions in alertness, nor has
it been shown to cause withdrawal symptoms.
the adverse symptoms reported with  xxxd3078xxx 
are mild. all long-term investigations that have
been carried out support the conclusion that

 xxxd3078xxx  is a well tolerated and effective drug
for the treatment of insomnia.

introduction
melatonin, the major hormone secreted by
the pineal gland, was ﬁrst identiﬁed by lerner
in 1958. this hormone has a number of important physiological functions including regulation of circadian rhythms, sleep promotion and
consolidation,1 anti-oxidative defense,2-4 immune
regulation and aging,5,6 control of reproductive
activity,7,8 and suppression of tumor growth.9,10
the secretion of melatonin is greatest during
the dark hours of the night, an effect so consistently expressed that it is now considered to
be the chemical signal indicating the length of
darkness.11 as the highest levels of melatonin
secretion occur during the nighttime in diurnally active vertebrates, it has been suggested
that melatonin has a crucial role in sleep promotion, at least in this group of organisms. owing
to its involvement in the regulation of circadian
rhythms, any disruption in melatonin secretion
may play an important part in the etiology of
circadian rhythm sleep disorders (crsd). this
has consequently led to advocacy for exogenous
melatonin use in the treatment of crsd.12-16
melatonin is also being widely used as a natural
supplement or, in its analog variants, as a drug
for various sleep disorders, including the (self-)
treatment of insomnia.17-20

individuals,22,23 in patients with depression, 24
and in those with dementia and neurodegenerative disorders. according to a national sleep
foundation survey (usa), 75% of the adults in
the usa have at least one symptom of a sleep
disorder and 54% have one symptom related
to insomnia.25 treatment for insomnia includes
both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic
treatments. selection of an appropriate antiinsomnia therapy is based upon a number of
factors such as age, the nature of the disease,
response to current medications, etc. a number of nonpharmacologic therapies including cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation
therapy, yoga, stimulus control therapy, and
sleep-hygiene education have all been employed
for treatment of insomnia and have been variously found effective in certain cases.26,27 drugs
such as triazolam or zolpidem that act as benzodiazepine receptor agonists (bzras) and that
modulate gamma-aminobutyric a (gaba a)
receptor function in the brain are used widely for
treating insomnia.28 the antidepressant trazodone is also commonly prescribed for the condition. these drugs, however, have been linked
to a number of side effects.
benzodiazepines (bzds) are associated with
cognitive and memory impairment, 29 while
trazodone has been shown to cause cardiac
rhythm disturbances and orthostatic hypotension.30 drugs without these side effects would
certainly benefit not only elderly individuals with insomnia but also a number of other
patients with this condition.
melatonin in insomnia

management of insomnia
insomnia is one of the most frequently
reported complaints in clinical practice
and affects 30%-40% of the adult population. 21 it most commonly occurs in elderly

sleep disturbances, which are frequently
observed in the elderly, have been related to
low nocturnal melatonin production that is
seen in most individuals of advanced age. 31
melatonin’s sleep-promoting activity has

615

indeed been demonstrated both in animals
and humans. melatonin has been shown to
reduce sleep onset latency (sol) and to increase
sleep efficiency when administered in the
evening to healthy adults in doses ranging from
0.3 to 1 mg.32,33 brain imaging studies of awake
subjects have shown that melatonin modulates brain activity patterns to resemble those
of actual sleep.34 a number of double-blind,
placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated
that melatonin is suitable as a hypnotic drug.
in a study undertaken with 13 patients, ranging in age from 25 to 65 years, administration
of 75 mg of melatonin for 7 days signiﬁcantly
increased the subjective report of total sleep
time (tst) and daytime alertness when compared with placebo; 35 however, the dose of
melatonin administered was high. in another
study, a low dosage of melatonin was used. in
this double-blind placebo-controlled study of
10 patients, administration of melatonin in
1 mg and 5 mg doses signiﬁcantly improved the
overall subjective quality of sleep and promoted
an earlier onset of sleep. rapid eye movement
onset latency was also delayed in this study.36
melatonin administration (5 mg/fast-release
tablets) was found to improve sleep quality in
seven of 15 patients with insomnia who had
been resistant to treatment with bzds and zopiclone.37 in two separate groups of elderly patients

individuals with insomnia by the european
medicines agency [emea].) in one study the
efﬁcacy of melatonin on sleep was evaluated
in 25 patients (mean age 37.3±15.3 years) who
had delayed sleep phase syndrome (dsps).
polysomnography (psg) revealed that melatonin in 5 mg doses signiﬁcantly improved sleep
quality without altering sleep architecture.40 in
psg studies of 20 patients with dsps, melatonin in doses of 5 mg/day for 4 weeks signiﬁcantly decreased sleep latency when compared
with placebo.41 although in general published
studies have employed only small numbers of
patients, a meta-analysis of 17 studies clearly
indicated that melatonin preparations produced statistically signiﬁcant beneﬁts in sol,
sleep efﬁciency, and sleep duration.42

melatonin’s hypnotic and chronobiotic
effects are believed to be primarily exerted via
mt1 and mt2 receptors located in the circadian
pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn)
of the anterior hypothalamus.43-45 scn neurons
express high concentrations of both melatonin
receptors, although both receptors are also found
widely in the central nervous system. while the
principal mt2-mediated actions in the scn are

with insomnia (mean age 73.1±5.2 years, eight
patients; and 81.1±8.9 years, 18 patients),
administration of 2 mg fast-release melatonin
improved sleep efﬁciency (p<0.05).38 similarly,
in a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled crossover study of 12 elderly individuals with chronic insomnia (aged 76±3.9 years),
administration of 2 mg prolonged-release
melatonin for 3 weeks followed by placebo
resulted in signiﬁcant improvement of sleep
efficiency (p<0.001) 39 (this formulation has
just been approved for the treatment of elderly

related to circadian phase shifts and comprise
activations of protein kinase c46,47 (an index of
increased cell activity), signaling via mt1 leads
primarily to suppression of the electrical activity of scn neurons. 48,49 it is, therefore, likely
that the hypnotic effects of melatonin that are
not associated with phase shifting are mediated
by mt1. the role of scn in the control of sleep
has been well studied in various species. it is,
however, important to make a clear distinction
between sleep induction as well as maintenance
of sleep at appropriate circadian phases and

melatonin in the regulation of sleep:
possible mechanisms of action

616

phase shifting. in squirrel monkeys, a diurnal
species like humans, the circadian signal produced by the scn promotes wakefulness during subjective day and consolidation of sleep at
night. scn lesions have been found to disrupt
the consolidation of the sleep-wake cycle.50 the
circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion also
regulates core body temperature, a function
that is known to inﬂuence sleep.1,51
melatonin’s hypnotic effect has been shown
to depend on the circadian phase of administration. as shown by stone et al.52 in a doubleblind, placebo-controlled study, melatonin
administered at night (11:30 pm) had no signiﬁcant effect on nighttime sleep in healthy
individuals, whereas its administration in the
evening (6:00 pm ) exerted hypnotic activity.
although the exact reason for this difference
is not known, melatonin levels in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid of the third ventricle, which are
nearly 20 times higher than those found in
the circulation, were assumed to be responsible
for the variations of melatonin’s action in the
brain.53,54 despite the evidence of these cited
reports on melatonin’s hypnotic actions, its
efﬁcacy in promoting sleep efﬁciency has been
questioned, especially as most of the results
have shown only borderline signiﬁcance or are
otherwise difﬁcult to evaluate because of methodological inconsistencies. 55 the poor outcomes concerning sleep efﬁciency or tst have
been attributed to melatonin’s short half-life
(of less than 30 minutes) in the circulation. it
has therefore been suggested that a melatonergic agonist with a longer half-life and, thus, an
enhanced bioavailability, would saturate mt 1
and mt2 receptors in the scn more efﬁciently
and for a longer duration of time. it has consequently been further suggested that such an
agonist might be of greater beneﬁt than melatonin in promoting sleep efﬁciency in patients
with insomnia.54

ramelton, a melatonergic
agonist with sleep
promoting properties
 xxxd3078xxx  {(s)-n-[2-(1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2hindeno[5,4-b]furan-8-yl)ethyl] propionamide;
 xxxd3078xxx } is a novel melatonin receptor agonist that has been shown to be selective for mt1
and mt2 receptors, but without afﬁnity for the
melatonin-binding  xxxg1593xxx , previously called mt3.56,57  xxxd3078xxx  has no afﬁnity
for gaba-ergic, dopaminergic, opioidergic, nor
any other major cns receptors, binding sites of
neurotransmitters or neuropeptides, regulatory
enzymes, or ion channels.56,57 however, various
additional nonmembrane-binding sites of melatonin remain to be tested.58
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3078xxx 
in-vitro binding studies have shown that
 xxxd3078xxx ’s afﬁnity for mt1 and mt2 receptors
is 3-16 times higher than that of melatonin
itself. although  xxxd3078xxx  has a relatively short
half-life (1.2 hours), it is, however, substantially longer than that of melatonin. 56 when
administered orally,  xxxd3078xxx  is absorbed
rapidly in fasting conditions and reaches its
peak concentration in plasma in 45 minutes,
which ranges from 30 minutes to 1.5 hours.
the total absorption of this drug is 84%, but
its total bioavailability is only 1.8%. after
administration of the therapeutic dose (8 mg),
the peak plasma concentration of  xxxd3078xxx 
increases up to 57,000 pg/ml.59
 xxxd3078xxx  is metabolized by oxidation to
hydroxyl and carbonyl derivatives and is eliminated within 96 hours after oral administration.
it is metabolized in humans to four metabolites:
m-i, m-ii, m-iii, and m-iv. m-ii is the major
metabolite of  xxxd3078xxx  followed by m-iv,
m-i, and m-iii. m-ii exhibits a selectivity for

adv ther (2009) 26(6):613-626.

melatonin mt1 and mt2 receptors that is similar
to that of the parent compound; however, it has
an afﬁnity of only 10% of that of  xxxd3078xxx .56
m-ii attains plasma concentrations 20-100-fold
(average about 30-fold) greater than that of the
parent compound,60 m-ii, which is formed by
the cytochrome p450 subform cyp1a2, and has
a half-life of 2-4 hours in the circulation, a value
that only partially explains the differences in
concentration. despite the lower receptor afﬁnity, the considerably higher blood levels of m-ii
support the hypothesis that this metabolite
should substantially contribute to  xxxd3078xxx ’s
overall activity,60 and may enhance its sleeppromoting efficacy.  xxxd3078xxx  clearance has
often been shown to be signiﬁcantly reduced in
elderly subjects, an effect that is not signiﬁcantly
inﬂuenced by gender. in view of the extended
persistence of m-ii in the circulation, the pharmacokinetics of the drug should not be primarily judged on the basis of  xxxd3078xxx  clearance
alone. this is one of the most unusual pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd3078xxx .
 xxxd3078xxx : sleep-promoting actions in
primate studies
in a study conducted in young adult female
monkeys (n=22) (macaca fascicularis), cortical
electroencephalography, electromyography, and
electrooculography were recorded.61 individual
monkeys received, at 6:00 pm, different doses
of  xxxd3078xxx  (0.003, 0.03, and 0.3 mg/kg) and,
correspondingly, other animals were treated at
the same circadian phase with different doses of
melatonin (0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg). for comparison,
zolpidem was also administered to other experimental groups (1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg). the
study demonstrated that  xxxd3078xxx , in doses of
0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg, was effective in reducing the
time to sleep onset as compared with controls.
 xxxd3078xxx , in these two doses, also signiﬁcantly

617

increased the total duration of sleep. melatonin
(1 and 3 mg doses) also tended to increase the
total duration of sleep, but without attaining statistical signiﬁcance. zolpidem, in none
of the doses tested (1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg),
had any effect on the latency to slow wave
sleep, nor on tst. the investigators concluded
that  xxxd3078xxx  reduced the sol and increased
sleep duration in freely moving monkeys without producing the side effects often seen with
bzras.61 in another study in monkeys,  xxxd3078xxx  did not promote physical dependence,62 a
ﬁnding of particular importance for judging the
usefulness of the drug.
 xxxd3078xxx ’s effects on sleep: clinical studies
the efficacy, safety, and dose-response of
 xxxd3078xxx  were evaluated by erman et al.63 in
a multicenter clinical trial. one hundred and
seventeen patients with chronic primary insomnia were studied in 13 centers in a double-blind,
randomized, crossover investigation, which took
place over a 5-year period. the mean age of the
enrolled patients was 37.7 years. each patient
was randomized to a dose sequence of 4, 8, 16,
and 32 mg  xxxd3078xxx  or placebo. each patient
underwent ﬁve 2-day treatment periods. the
investigators found that all doses of  xxxd3078xxx 
resulted in statistically signiﬁcant reductions in
latency to persistent sleep (lps) and increased
sleep duration, as measured by psg.63 further, it
was noted that  xxxd3078xxx  did not produce any
residual sedation, nor psychomotor nor memory impairment. of the 117 patients studied,
103 completed the study. the reasons given for
premature withdrawal were not directly related
to drug use. in the subjects that completed
the study, all doses of  xxxd3078xxx  (4, 8, 16, and
32 mg) resulted in statistically signiﬁcant reductions in lps (p<0.001) and increases in tst
(p<0.05). patients with a higher lps at screening

618

(>66.5 minutes) experienced more reductions
in the time to reach persistent sleep. mean lps
was 26.2-29.8 minutes across treatment groups
as compared with 48.8 minutes for placebo
(p<0.001). in contrast, in patients with a shorter
screening lps (<66.5 minutes) the lps was 15.721.8 minutes across treatment groups as compared with 26.2 minutes for placebo (p<0.05).
similarly, the group of patients with a screening tst less than 358 minutes showed greater
improvements than did the group whose screening was greater than 358 minutes.63 all  xxxd3078xxx  doses resulted in similar improvements
suggesting that  xxxd3078xxx  promotes sleep in a
manner that differs from that of other hypnotics.
more speciﬁcally,  xxxd3078xxx  activates mt1 receptors in the scn to attenuate the circadian wakepromoting signal, thus allowing the homeostatic
sleep load to promote sleep.63
roth et al.64 investigated the subjective efﬁcacy of  xxxd3078xxx  in 829 elderly outpatients
(mean age of 72.4 years) with chronic insomnia.
of the initially selected sample, 128 patients were
discontinued. in a double-blind study  xxxd3078xxx  was administered in doses of 4 or 8 mg/day
for a period of 5 weeks in comparison with placebo. discontinuation was approximately equal
between groups being due most commonly
to a lack of efﬁcacy (placebo, n=17;  xxxd3078xxx 
4 mg, n=14; and  xxxd3078xxx  8 mg, n=9), protocol deviation (placebo, n=10;  xxxd3078xxx  4 mg,
n=15; and  xxxd3078xxx  8 mg, n=10), and adverse
events (placebo, n=8;  xxxd3078xxx  4 mg, n=8; and
 xxxd3078xxx  8 mg, n=7). compared with the placebo group, patients in both  xxxd3078xxx  groups
reported statistically signiﬁcant reductions in
sol (16%-35%) at the end of week 1 and week 5.
also, in this study a greater treatment effect was
found in patients who had a high baseline sleep
latency (>67.1 minutes). the overall median of
baseline sleep latency (>67.1 minutes) was used
as the cut-off value. the superiority of  xxxd3078xxx 

adv ther (2009) 26(6):613-626.

over placebo in reducing sleep latency was consistently demonstrated at every dose level and
time period that were evaluated:
s at week 1—for 4 mg: 93.1 minutes with  xxxd3078xxx  vs. 107.0 minutes with placebo
(p=0.013); for 8 mg: 90.2 vs. 107.0 minutes
(p=0.003).
s at week 3—for 8 mg: 79.3 vs. 96.5 minutes
(p=0.004).
s at week 5—for 4 mg: 83.6 vs. 98.2 minutes
(p=0.015); for 8 mg: 74.9 vs. 98.2 minutes
(p<0.001).
increases in tst were observed in both  xxxd3078xxx  groups at week 1 (p=0.004) and week 3
(p=0.055). at week 1, for 4 mg of  xxxd3078xxx  the
effect was 324.6 vs. 313.9 minutes with placebo
(p=0.004); for 8 mg: 321.1 vs. 313.9 minutes (p=0.055). at week 3, for 4 mg of  xxxd3078xxx  the effect was 336.0 vs. 324.3 minutes
(p=0.007); for 8 mg: 332.1 vs. 324.3 minutes
(p=0.071). these results were consistent with
patient reports of enhanced sleep quality and of
feeling refreshed upon arising in the morning —
ﬁndings also in agreement with psg studies on
 xxxd3078xxx .65 sleep promotion by  xxxd3078xxx  was
dose-independent as in a previous study.65 this
study also supports the ﬁnding that  xxxd3078xxx 
is a chronohypnotic agent with a speciﬁc action
on mt1 and mt2 receptors in the scn that are
involved in the normal regulation of a sleepwake cycle.
in a clinical study on 100 elderly patients
drawn from 17 sleep centers,  xxxd3078xxx  in doses
of 4 mg/day increased patients’ tst (p=0.036)
and sleep efﬁciency (p=0.037) and shortened the
lps (p=0.001).65
the effects of differing doses of  xxxd3078xxx 
were studied by zammit and coworkers 66 in
another multicenter, double-blind, placebocontrolled study. the investigators used psg to
evaluate the effects of  xxxd3078xxx  8 mg and 16 mg
on 405 patients with chronic insomnia. a total of

adv ther (2009) 26(6):613-626.

371 patients completed the double-blind study
and 267 completed the single-blind follow-up.
during the double-blind treatment period discontinuation was due to adverse events (n=6),
lack of efficacy (n=2), protocol deviation
(n=6), withdrawal of consent (n=18), lost to
follow-up (n=1), and withdrawn because of
noncompliance (n=1). during a single-blind
runout period after treatment four subjects
were lost: discontinued treatment due to
adverse event (n=1), withdrawal of consent
(n=1), protocol deviation (n=1), and one subject missed visit 5 due to work-related travel.
lps was signiﬁcantly reduced with  xxxd3078xxx 
8 mg (32.2 minutes) or 16 mg (28.9 minutes),
when compared with placebo (47.9 minutes). these effects were maintained following
3-5 weeks (after  xxxd3078xxx  was discontinued).
both doses of  xxxd3078xxx  also prolonged total
duration of sleep.66
in a related study involving a larger population (289 adults), the efﬁcacy and safety of
 xxxd3078xxx , 8 mg and 16 mg per day, was evaluated.67 compared with placebo,  xxxd3078xxx  at
8 mg signiﬁcantly reduced psg measures of lps
(12.2-19.7 minutes, p=0.004). tst was signiﬁcantly increased by  xxxd3078xxx  at both 8 mg/day
(436.8 minutes, p=0.009) and 16 mg/day
(433.1 minutes, p=0.043).67 in another 5-week,
double-blind, controlled study carried out
by takeda pharmaceuticals, illinois, usa, the
effects of 8 mg/day doses of  xxxd3078xxx  were
evaluated in 270 patients with chronic insomnia.68  xxxd3078xxx  8 mg/day was associated with
reductions in lps at week 1 (63% for  xxxd3078xxx 
vs. 39.7% for placebo; p<0.001), week 3 ( xxxd3078xxx  63% vs. placebo 41.2%; p<0.01), and
week 5 ( xxxd3078xxx  65.9% vs. placebo 48.9%;
p<0.05). the improvement in lps, which was
evident from the ﬁrst week, was sustained until
week 5, without associated withdrawal effects or
rebound insomnia.68

619

in a longitudinal study  xxxd3078xxx  8 mg/day
improved sleep in the ﬁrst week, but was associated with somewhat mixed effects at later stages
of the study. the drug was nevertheless well tolerated by the sample with chronic insomnia.69
a recently published pooled analysis included
four randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled clinical trials of  xxxd3078xxx  in
566 adult patients with chronic insomnia
who took  xxxd3078xxx  8 mg as compared with
556 patients with insomnia who took placebo.70  xxxd3078xxx  reduced lps on nights 1 and 2
by 13 minutes more than placebo in adults with
chronic insomnia. at nights 1 and 2 the mean
lps for the  xxxd3078xxx  8 mg group was 30.2 minutes, which was significantly less than the
mean lps for the placebo group at 43.3 minutes
(p<0.01), thus substantiating the clinical efﬁcacy
of  xxxd3078xxx  in promoting sleep.
the effectiveness and tolerability of  xxxd3078xxx  was also examined in adult patients
with generalized anxiety disorder and insomnia symptoms in an open-label study, including 27 adults with sleep disturbance meeting
dsm-iv diagnostic criteria.71 after 12 weeks a
signiﬁcant symptom reduction was observed on
all scales, with patients falling asleep faster and
sleeping longer; the data suggesting that  xxxd3078xxx  may be an effective treatment for insomnia
symptoms in generalized anxiety disorder.
in a 6-month randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study carried out in 46 centers in the usa, europe, russia, and australia,
451 adults (age ≥18 years) with chronic primary insomnia received  xxxd3078xxx  8 mg or
placebo 30 minutes before bedtime. 72 sleep
was evaluated by psg and morning questionnaires on the first 2 nights of week 1; the
last 2 nights of months 1, 3, 5, and 6; and
nights 1 and 2 of the placebo run-out. over
the 6 months of treatment,  xxxd3078xxx  consistently reduced lps compared with baseline

and with placebo with no significant next
morning residual effects, withdrawal symptoms, or rebound insomnia.
sleep disturbances have been reported to
be one of the most troubling manifestations
of menopause.21 in 20 healthy peri- and postmenopausal women with insomnia participating in a 6-week, prospective, open-label trial of
 xxxd3078xxx  (8 mg), signiﬁcant improvements in
sol, tst, and sleep efﬁciency were observed
in diary data while gains in sleep quality, sleep
impairment, daytime functioning, quality of
life, and mood were found in self-report measures.73 there was no evidence of tolerance nor
rebound insomnia over the course of the trial.
randomized controlled trials are needed to further evaluate the efﬁcacy of  xxxd3078xxx ’s use by
menopausal women. this recommendation is
particularly relevant as many women are now
seeking alternative treatments for sleep disturbances in menopause due to concerns about the
risks and side effects of the commonly employed
hormone replacement treatments.
dsps is a crsd in which sol is delayed in
some cases by as much as 2-6 hours. it is characterized by the chronic inability to fall asleep
at the desired clock time. 74 dahlitz et al. 75
reported that the administration of 5 mg melatonin advanced sleep onset time by an average of 82 minutes (range 19-124 minutes) and
waking time by 117 minutes in patients with
dsps. there is evidence to implicate endogenous melatonin as an important factor in the
pathophysiology of crsd.16 the therapeutic

–80.5±14.8 (p=0.003), and –90.5±15.2 minutes
were determined for placebo, 1, 2, and 4 mg,
respectively (p=0.001 for significance  xxxd3078xxx  vs. placebo). surprisingly, the higher dose
of 8 mg  xxxd3078xxx /day did not cause any significant changes as compared with placebo
(–27.9±16.4 minutes, p=0.392) — an unexpected
divergence between the soporiﬁc and phase shifting effects according to dlmoff. although this
discrepancy was not resolved, it was concluded
that  xxxd3078xxx  nevertheless had the therapeutic potential for treating crsd.76

potential of  xxxd3078xxx  to treat crsd was indicated by a study of the phase-shifting capacity
of varying doses of the compound in healthy
subjects.76  xxxd3078xxx , at doses of 1, 2, 4, and
8 mg, was administered to 75 adults of the age
group 18-45 years for 6 days. administration
of 1, 2, or 4 mg of  xxxd3078xxx  for a period of
4 days was found to promote signiﬁcant phase

bzds and non- xxxd1459xxx  hypnotics cause either addiction, withdrawal symptoms, or trigger rebound
insomnia, the relative absence of symptoms following the use of  xxxd3078xxx  underscores its speciﬁc advantages for the treatment of insomnia.
in an open-label study, patients with primary insomnia received  xxxd3078xxx  nightly for
1 year.79 subjects aged ≥65 years received ramel-

adverse effects of  xxxd3078xxx 
and safety
the incidence of adverse effects of  xxxd3078xxx ,
as inferred from subjects’ complaints and neurologic parameters, has been reported to be similar
to that of placebo. in a study by erman et al.63
the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse
events ranged from 8.4% to 10.7% among the
 xxxd3078xxx  groups and was 8.7% in the placebo
group. the most commonly reported adverse
events were headache, somnolence, dizziness,
and sore throat.  xxxd3078xxx  was found to be well
tolerated and showed no signiﬁcant next-day
morning psychomotor, memory, or cognitive
effects.67,77,78 inasmuch as all currently available

adv ther (2009) 26(6):613-626.

teon, 8 mg (n=248), while those aged 18-64 years
received  xxxd3078xxx , 16 mg (n=965).  xxxd3078xxx 
was associated with sustained improvements
in subjective sleep latency, subjective tst, and
clinical global impressions. a total of 495
of 1213 subjects (40.8%) reported at least one
adverse event possibly associated with  xxxd3078xxx  use. the adverse events reported varied
considerably (mild=30.7%; moderate=54.2%;
and severe=15.1%), the incidence of individual
adverse events was low (12.2% discontinued
due to adverse events), and the frequencies of
adverse events were similar at months 6 and 12
for both age groups. there were no noteworthy
changes in vital signs, physical examinations,
clinical chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis values and no electrocardiogram changes to suggest adverse cardiac effects. endocrine values
remained within normal range throughout treatment although consistent statistically signiﬁcant decreases in free thyroxine (in adults) and
free testosterone (in older men) were detected.
duration of menses increased by approximately
1 day.79
in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of
adults (18-45 years) with chronic insomnia to
evaluate the effects of  xxxd3078xxx  on endocrine
function  xxxd3078xxx  16 mg or placebo was given
nightly for 6 months.77 there were no consistent statistically signiﬁcant differences between
treatments on measures of thyroid function
(total or free thyroxine,  xxxd3368xxx , total triiodothyronine), adrenal function
(morning cortisol and  xxxg1801xxx ), or on most reproductive endocrine measures (luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating
hormone, estradiol [women], total and free
testosterone [men]). prolactin concentrations
were increased overall in women in the  xxxd3078xxx  group compared with placebo (p=0.003).
no clinical effects of elevated prolactin were
reported; average menstrual cycle length,

621

duration of menses, and ovulation probability
did not differ between groups.77
objective criteria in relation to metabolism,
other diseases, hepatotoxicity, etc, have been
also investigated by takeda pharmaceuticals,
and  xxxd3078xxx  clearly met a number of such
safety requirements that had been fundamental for approval by the food and drug
administration (fda). nevertheless, it should
not be overlooked that the melatonin receptors mt1 and mt2 are not only located in the
scn and do not only regulate the circadian
pacemaker. additional effects via these receptors have to be expected, eg, in cerebral vasomotor control, in immunomodulation, and
other hormonal systems, including those
involved in reproduction. reasons for concern in
this regard have been discussed elsewhere58,80,81
and may become particularly relevant for longterm treatment with the drug.
it should be noted that in may 2008 the
emea declined to grant marketing authorization for ramel-teon. following this, takeda
pharmaceuticals requested a re-examination of
the opinion, which was under review at the time
of the application withdrawal by the company,
based on its current plan to extend the clinical
program to address emea’s questions regarding
the medicine’s risk-beneﬁt proﬁle.
some pharmacodynamic considerations
concerning  xxxd3078xxx 
taken together, the evidence reviewed above
suggests generally that  xxxd3078xxx , like melatonin, exerts its direct sleep-inducing effects via
mt1 receptors located in the scn, while inducing
phase shifting, mainly via mt2 receptors. because
 xxxd3078xxx ’s direct soporiﬁc effect, as measured
by the reduction of sol (but not the phaseshifting capacity) is indistinguishable at 4 mg
and 8 mg,  xxxd3078xxx  seems to promote sleep by

622

regulating the sleep-wake cycle rather than having a more generalized cns depressant effect.
this is supported by observations that  xxxd3078xxx 
does not worsen sleep apnea in insomniacs.82
owing to its potent effect on melatonin
receptors in the scn,  xxxd3078xxx  should accelerate sleep onset by inﬂuencing the hypothalamic “sleep-switch” downstream from the
scn, in principle in the same way as melatonin.
however, owing to its higher receptor afﬁnity
it does so more efﬁciently.58 the sleep-switch
model originally proposed by saper and colleagues82 describes “ﬂip-ﬂop” reciprocal inhibitions among sleep-associated activities in the
ventrolateral preoptic nucleus and wakefulness
associated activities in the locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe, and tuberomammilary nuclei.83,84 it
has been hypothesized that the prolonged use
of  xxxd3078xxx  can result in the desensitization
of mt2 receptors in the scn.85 however, no evidence for such an effect has been provided for
 xxxd3078xxx . from studies of the scn or immortalized scn2.2 neurons desensitization and
internalization of mt2 is known to occur following exogenous melatonin administration.86,87
whether or not downregulation by  xxxd3078xxx 
is stronger or longer-lasting, or even occurs,
remains to be demonstrated.
in any event, the studies of  xxxd3078xxx ’s
actions indicate that this drug, the ﬁrst melatonin receptor agonist approved by the fda,
represents a good pharmacologic option for the
treatment of sleep initiation in insomnia88 and

adv ther (2009) 26(6):613-626.

thus has a promising future for use in patients
with chronic insomnia.58

tst. during treatments lasting several weeks, the
incidence of adverse effects with  xxxd3078xxx  has
been reported to be similar to that of placebo.
 xxxd3078xxx  administration has been shown to
be free of other undesired effects such as next
day hangover, memory impairment, psychomotor retardation, or cognitive impairment. the
hypnotic action of  xxxd3078xxx  is attributed to its
effect on melatonergic mt1 and mt2 receptors
present in the scn. it has been also effective in
causing phase advances of sleep-wake rhythms
in humans, and thus has potential therapeutic
value not only in primary insomnia but also in
crsd. no study is available comparing  xxxd3078xxx  versus melatonin in their efﬁcacy.
other melatonergic agonists, such as  xxxd95xxx  and  xxxd3294xxx , are now on the market or
are in the process of being approved by the fda
or emea. moreover, a slow-release preparation
of melatonin has just been approved by emea
for use in elderly patients with sleep disorders.
a last important point to be considered is that
melatonin-like compounds generally display a
modest sleep-inducing effect, quite mild as compared with bzp. certainly because of the long
time in the market and the lack of new alternatives for the treatment of insomnia, the preconception that the consumer has of a sleep pill is
that of a strong sleep inducer, something that
the melatonin family of compounds will never
accomplish. therefore, a very important educational goal is to change this view on the lack
of negative effects (addiction, dependence, etc)
that melatonin analogs have in the face of the
well-known complications of bzp.89
