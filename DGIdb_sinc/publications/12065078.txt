abstract
chronic ethanol consumption contributes to cardiovascular dysfunction possibly related to loss of mg2 +. this study was designed to
examine the role of dietary mg2 + supplementation on chronic ethanol ingestion-induced vascular alteration. rats were fed an ethanol liquid
diet supplemented with or without mg2 + for 12 weeks. the force-generating capacity was examined in thoracic aortic rings. ethanolconsuming animals exhibited significantly elevated blood pressure. in aorta with intact endothelium, the contractile responses to norepinephrine and kcl were greatly attenuated and potentiated, respectively. interestingly, the  xxxd102xxx induced alterations in blood pressure and
vasoconstrictive response were restored by mg2 + supplementation. pretreatment with the h1-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol in intact aortic
rings abolished the difference in response to norepinephrine between the control and ethanol groups, which implies the involvement of a
weakened h1-adrenoceptor component in vessels from the  xxxd102xxx fed rats. the norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction in intact aorta rings
was completely abolished by the a1-adrenoceptor antagonist  xxxd3000xxx . in endothelium-denuded aorta, the contractile response to norepinephrine or kcl was not significantly different between the ethanol and mg2 + groups. endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation to carbamylcholine chloride was not altered by either ethanol or mg2 + supplementation. sodium nitroprusside-induced vasorelaxation was depressed
by ethanol, and restored by mg2 +, in aorta with or without endothelium. these data suggest that chronic ethanol consumption contributes to
alterations of endothelium-dependent and -independent vascular response. these alterations can be compensated by dietary mg2 +
supplementation. d 2002 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
chronic ethanol consumption is associated with cardiovascular dysfunctions independent of other known risk factors (altura and altura, 1982, 1987a; patel et al., 1997).
although light to moderate ethanol consumption may lower
blood pressure and benefit cardiovascular function, excessive
ethanol consumption is believed to be associated with a
number of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension

(moore et al, 1990; patel et al., 1997). several mechanisms
have been postulated for the hypertensive response to chronic
ethanol consumption such as secretion of hormones and
neurotransmitters, stimulation of the sympathetic nervous
system, and alteration of baroreceptor activity (altura and
altura, 1982, 1987a). evidence also suggests the existence of
a myogenic mechanism(s) involving alteration in the contractile properties of vascular smooth muscle (altura and
altura, 1982). chronic ethanol exposure has been suggested
to facilitate ca2 + influx in smooth muscle cells, thus increasing the intracellular ca2 + concentration and vascular tone
(altura and altura, 1982). however, the exact mechanism(s)
underlying ultrastructural changes, myocardial depression,
and alterations in vascular reactivity following chronic exposure to ethanol remain only partially understood.

while the etiology of alcoholic cardiomyopathy may be
multifactorial, the association of chronic ethanol consumption and profound hypomagnesemia has been recognized
(flink et al, 1953; flink, 1986; brautbar and altura, 1987).
indeed, although a number of therapeutic agents such as the
cardiac glycosides, anticancer drugs, and diuretic agents are
positively correlated with mg2 + deficiency in humans,
ethanol has often been described as the most notorious cause
of mg2 + wasting (kalbfleish et al, 1963). mg2 + is a fundamental constituent of soft tissue and bone. it catalyzes the
activity of at least 350 enzymes (such as hexokinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, enolase, and creatine phosphokinase)
by causing a conformational change during catalytic processes and promoting aggregation of multienzyme complexes (altura and altura, 1984; murphy, 2000; romani
and scarpa, 2000). mg2 + also plays a role in mitochondrial
membrane permeability and maintenance of low resting
levels of intracellular free ca2 + (altura and altura, 1995;
resnick, 1995). compelling evidence has suggested that
mg2 + may flux across the cell membrane in either direction
in response to hormonal and non-hormonal stimuli, resulting
in major changes in total and, to a lesser extent, free mg2 +
content within tissues (altura and altura, 1995; resnick,
1995). mg2 + is considered as an intracellular messenger and
has been shown to modulate a number of physiologic properties in vascular smooth muscle cells including ion (ca2 +,
k + ) channel conductance, membrane oxidation, and lipid
composition (morrill et al., 1997, 1998; yang et al., 1999;
romani and scarpa, 2000; shi and cui, 2001). in addition,
dietary mg2 + deficiency induces hypertension while dietary
mg2 + supplementation prevents the development of hypertension in animals genetically predisposed to higher systolic
blood pressure (altura et al., 1984, 1992). since both na +
and ca2 + membrane transport and vascular smooth muscle
contraction are regulated by mg2 + -dependent atpase activity, it is possible that increases in intracellular ca2 + and na +
concentration can be attributed to hypomagnesemia and are
possibly related to hypertension (altura and altura, 1984;
altura et al., 1992).
the primary mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced
hypomagnesemia are reduced dietary intake and enhanced

renal excretion (flink, 1986). altura and altura (1986,
1987a) demonstrated that dietary mg2 + supplementation in
experimental animals prevented the development of hypertension following long-term ethanol exposure, suggesting
that mg2 + depletion may play an important role in the
pathogenesis of chronic  xxxd102xxx induced hypertension. we
have recently shown that chronic  xxxd102xxx induced myocardial contractile dysfunction can be partially prevented by
dietary mg2 + supplementation (brown et al., 1998). despite
these important findings, the role of dietary mg2 + supplementation in chronic  xxxd102xxx related vascular dysfunction
has not been reported. the purpose of this study was to
examine the effects of dietary mg2 + supplementation on
vascular contractile function under the influence of chronic
ethanol consumption.

2. materials and methods
2.1. experimental animals
experimental protocols described in this study were
approved by the animal care committee of wayne state
university and have been previously described (brown and
savage, 1996). adult sprague –dawley rats (both genders)
were obtained as pairs of littermates weighing approximately
50 g. all animals were housed in a temperature-controlled
room under a 12-h light/dark illumination cycle and allowed
tap water ad libitum. animals were initially maintained on
standard rat chow for a 1-week quarantine period.
2.2. chronic ethanol exposure
following the quarantine period, all animals were introduced to a nutritionally complete liquid diet (shake and pour
bioserv, frenchtown, nj, usa) for a 1-week acclimation
period (de carli and leiber, 1967; brown et al., 1998). the
employment of a liquid diet is based on the observations
made by keane and leonard (1989) that ethanol self-administration resulted in less nutritional deficiencies and less
stress to the animals in comparison to forced-feeding regi-

mens, intravenous administration, or aerosolized inhalation.
upon completion of the acclimation period, one littermate
was maintained on the liquid diet without ethanol, and the
remaining littermates began a 7-day period of ethanol introduction. on days 1 – 4,  xxxd102xxx consuming animals were
given a diet in which 12% of the total calories were isocalorically replaced by ethanol. subsequently, on days 5 – 7, the
caloric content of the diet provided by ethanol was increased
to 24%. on day 8,  xxxd102xxx consuming animals were introduced to a diet in which 36% of the total calories were
derived from ethanol. supplementation with mg2 + also
began on day 8, which marked the beginning of the 12-week
experimental period of chronic ethanol exposure. mg2 + supplemented animals received a diet containing 0.65 g/l of
mg2 + although nonsupplemented animals were given a diet
that consisted of 0.13 g/l of mg2 + . this value of mg2 +

243

content for the nonsupplemented diet corresponds to approximately 0.056% mg2 + by weight of the liquid diet. an
isocaloric (250 cal/l) pair-feeding regimen was employed
to eliminate the possibility of nutritional deficits. nonethanol-consuming animals were offered the same quantity
of diet  xxxd102xxx consuming animals drank the previous day.
consumption of liquid diet throughout the experimental
period was measured daily. blood pressure was determined
by the tail-cuff method. body weight recordings were
obtained on a weekly basis. the ethanol concentration in
blood samples was determined using a biochemistry analyzer
(ysi 2700 biochemistry analyzer, yellow springs, oh,
usa). serum electrolyte levels were determined at weeks
4, 8, and 12 by university laboratories, wayne state university health center utilizing the methylthymol blue
method for the determination of serum mg2 + levels.

2.3. aortic ring isolation procedure and tension recording

3. results

at the end of the 12-week experimental period, animals
were anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine solution (3:1,
1.32 mg/kg, i.p.). the thoracic aorta was quickly removed
and placed in an oxygenated physiologic salt solution (pss)
of the following composition (in mm): kcl 5.4, nacl 136.9,
nahco3 11.9, nah2po4 0.45, mgcl2 0.50, cacl2 2.7, and
glucose 5.6. vessels were trimmed free of connective tissue
and fat. the transverse segments (3 mm in length) were cut
with special care to avoid damage to the endothelial layer.
one aortic segment from each animal was left intact, while
the other segment was mechanically denuded of endothelium
by gently rubbing the intimal surface of the vessel. muscle
rings were then mounted vertically using fine wires inserted
through the lumen for isometric tension recording in 20-ml
organ baths containing pss gassed with 95% o2 and 5%
co2 at 37 jc and ph f 7.4. all rings were stretched to
f 0.7 g of resting tension and allowed to equilibrate for 90
min during which the bath solution was changed every 30
min. isometric contractile tension was measured by using
grass ft03 force – displacement transducers coupled to a
grass model 79 polygraph. presence of functional endothelium was determined by greater than 50% relaxation by
addition of carbamylcholine (2 am) to segments precontracted with norepinephrine (1 am). aortic segments relaxing less than 50% were considered to be without functional
endothelium (brown and savage, 1996).

3.1. general characteristics of animals
the pattern of weekly diet consumption and body weight
gain were similar in all groups (data not shown). the pairfeeding regimen ensured that consumption did not differ
between groups at any time throughout the study. however,
diet consumption increased linearly through the entire 12week experimental period. during week 1, the control and
 xxxd102xxx consuming animals drank approximately 52.8 ml/
day while the mg2 + -supplemented control and ethanolconsuming animals drank approximately 49.9 ml/day. by
week 12, their consumption increased to 82.9 and 85.7 ml/
day, respectively. the average weight gain in all animals
was approximately 30 g/week.

2.4. experimental protocols for vascular tension study
aortic ring segments, once mounted, were allowed to
equilibrate in pss for 1 h prior to the start of each experiment. dose – response curves were then constructed to
norepinephrine,  xxxd2988xxx  (kcl), carbamylcholine
chloride, and sodium nitroprusside (aldrich chemical, milwaukee, wi, usa). each agonist was added cumulatively,
and concentrations were allowed to elicit maximal response
before subsequent doses were applied. to define the adrenergic contribution in norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction, a selective h1-adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol
(sigma, st. louis, mo, usa), and an a1-adrenoceptor
antagonist,  xxxd3000xxx  (sigma), were tested by pre-incubating
with the vessels for 30 min prior to initiation of the norepinephrine protocol.
2.5. statistical analysis
two aortic segments were collected per animal (one
endothelium-intact; one endothelium-denuded). experimental groups include results from 10 to 12 rats. for each
experimental series, data are presented as mean f s.e.m.
statistical significance ( p < 0.05) was estimated by a twoway analysis of variance (anova) or t-test, where appropriate. a dunnett’s test was used for post hoc analysis when
required.

(151.6 f 0.6 vs. 132.9 f 2.7 mm hg, p < 0.05). mg2 + supplementation significantly attenuated  xxxd102xxx induced elevation of blood pressure (136.4 f 1.4 mm hg in mg2 + supplemented  xxxd102xxx consuming animals, p < 0.05 vs. the
ethanol group). furthermore, mg2 + supplementation also
significantly attenuated blood pressure in non- xxxd102xxx consuming control animals (125.0 f 3.1 mm hg for mg2 + supplementing control animals, p < 0.05 vs. the control
group).
3.2. vasoconstricting response to kcl and norepinephrine
(endothelium-intact)
3.2.1. effect of chronic ethanol consumption
as expected, bath application of kcl (5 – 120 mm)
produced dose-dependent vasoconstriction of aortic ring
segments with intact endothelium from both control and
 xxxd102xxx consuming animals (fig. 1a). chronic ethanol consumption shifted the dose – response curve of kcl to the left
when compared to the control animals. maximal tension
developed at 120 mm kcl was increased by 31% in the
ethanol group compared to control (1.34 and 1.02 g for
ethanol and control, respectively). submaximal response at
40 mm kcl was increased by 113% in the ethanol group
(0.98 g) compared to control (0.46 g). similar to kcl, bath
application of norepinephrine (0.01 –5 am) produced dosedependent contractions in aortic ring segments with intact
endothelium from control and ethanol groups (fig. 1b).
however, chronic ethanol consumption shifted the dosedependent response curve to the right when compared to
control animals.

supplementation on kcl- (panel a) or norepinephrine-induced (panel b)

the general characteristics of experimental animals are
shown in table 1. animals from all groups exhibited similar
body weight gain over the experimental period. neither
chronic ethanol consumption nor dietary mg2 + supplementation affected the heart and kidney weight/size. the liver
weight and size were significantly larger in those animals
that consumed ethanol while being supplemented with
mg2 + . serum analysis revealed that  xxxd102xxx consuming
animals had significantly lower mg2 + levels than the
control group. it is interesting that the mg2 + -supplemented/ xxxd102xxx consuming group had lower blood ethanol
concentrations than the non-mg2 + -supplemented ethanolconsuming animals.
 xxxd102xxx consuming animals exhibited elevated systolic
blood pressures compared to those of the control group

3.2.2. effect of dietary mg2+ supplementation
bath application of kcl produced dose-dependent contraction in ring segments with intact endothelium from
mg2 + -supplemented  xxxd102xxx consuming animals. interestingly, dietary mg2 + supplementation prevented ethanolinduced alteration in kcl-induced vasoconstriction by shifting the dose-dependent response curve to the right when
compared to the  xxxd102xxx consuming group (fig. 1c). maximal tension developed at 120 mm kcl was decreased by
18% with dietary mg2 + supplementation. submaximal
response at 40 mm kcl was decreased by 43% with
mg2 + supplementation. bath application of norepinephrine

produced dose-dependent vasoconstriction in aortic ring
segments with intact endothelium from the mg2 + -supplemented,  xxxd102xxx consuming group (fig. 1d). however,
dietary mg2 + supplementation shifted the dose –response
curve leftwards when compared to the ethanol group. dietary mg2 + supplementation did not cause any significant
effect to kcl- or norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction in
the non- xxxd102xxx consuming control group (data not shown).
collectively, these data suggest that chronic ethanol consumption-induced alterations in vasoconstriction in response
to kcl and norepinephrine are reversed by dietary mg2 +
supplementation.

3.3. vasoconstriction of norepinephrine in the presence of
atenolol and  xxxd3000xxx  (with endothelium)
to examine the potential contribution of the adrenergic
pathways in the altered norepinephrine-induced vasoconstrictive response following chronic ethanol consumption,
the endothelium-intact aortic ring segments from all groups
were pre-incubated with a selective a1-adrenoceptor antagonist,  xxxd3000xxx  (1 am), or a selective h1-adrenoceptor
antagonist, atenolol (1 am), for 30 min prior to the initiation
of the norepinephrine dose – response. none of the antagonists affected resting tension development (data not shown).
results in fig. 2 indicate that pretreatment by atenolol
shifted the norepinephrine concentration –response (0.01 –
5 am) curve to the right in vessels from the control group
but did not significantly affect the responsiveness in vessels
from the ethanol group. however, pretreatment with atenolol in aortic rings abolished the altered response to norepinephrine between the two groups, implicating the
involvement of a weakened h1-adrenoceptor component in
vessels from the  xxxd102xxx fed rats. the norepinephrine-elicited vasoconstrictive response was almost completely
abolished by  xxxd3000xxx , compared to the tension development
in the absence of the antagonists (shown in fig. 1). these
results suggest a predominant role of the a-adrenergic
pathway in norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction.
3.4. vasoconstricting response to kcl and norepinephrine
(endothelium-denuded)
as shown in fig. 3, neither chronic ethanol consumption
nor dietary mg2 + elicited any effect on the vasoconstriction
in response to kcl (5– 120 mm) or norepinephrine (0.01 –5
am) in aortic ring segments lacking intact endothelium.
3.5. vasorelaxant response to carbamylcholine chloride
(endothelium-intact)
the endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation to the acetylcholine analog, carbamylcholine chloride, was not different
in ring segments with intact endothelium among the four
animal groups tested (control,  xxxd102xxx consuming, mg2 + supplementing control, and mg2 + -supplementing ethanol).
carbamylcholine chloride (0.5 – 4 am) exhibited dosedependent vasorelaxation in endothelium-intact aortic rings
among all groups (fig. 4). the vasorelaxant response to
carbamylcholine chloride was not significantly different, as
sensitivity and maximal response were the same among
control,  xxxd102xxx consuming, and mg2 + -supplemented  xxxd102xxx consuming groups.
3.6. vasorelaxant response to sodium nitroprusside (endothelium-intact and endothelium-denuded)
sodium nitroprusside is a nonspecific  xxxd2738xxx  (no)
donor-mediating vascular smooth muscle relaxation inde-

247

pendent of the endothelium. results shown in fig. 5 exhibit
the dose-dependent vasorelaxant response of sodium nitroprusside (0.01 – 100 am) in aortic ring segments with or
without endothelium. aortic ring segments obtained from
chronic  xxxd102xxx consuming animals (both endotheliumintact and endothelium-denuded) showed an attenuated
vasorelaxant response to sodium nitroprusside when compared to the control group. dietary mg2 + supplementation
restored the vasorelaxant response which was diminished in
the ethanol group, most notably at the lower dose range (0.1
and 1 am). the maximal vasorelaxation elicited by sodium
nitroprusside appeared to be larger in the endotheliumdenuded rings compared to the rings with intact endothelium, suggesting an enhanced no sensitivity. lastly, dietary
mg2 + supplementation did not affect the sodium nitroprusside-induced vasorelaxant response in the non- xxxd102xxx consuming control group (data not shown). these data suggest
that chronic ethanol consumption-induced depression in
endothelium-independent vasorelaxant response was reversed with dietary mg2 + supplementation.

4. discussion
chronic ethanol ingestion leads to both mg2 + deficiency
and vascular dysfunction, contributing to elevated risk of
cardiovascular disease (flink, 1986; altura and altura,
1987a, 1994; brown and savage, 1996). mg2 + is necessary
for the normal vascular function while its deficiency may
contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease
(altura et al., 1984, 1992; altura and altura, 1986). our
current study confirmed previous reports (altura and altura,
1978; nishio et al., 1988) that the loss of serum mg2 + leads
to vascular dysfunction following chronic ethanol consumption. more importantly, our results indicate that alcoholismrelated vascular dysfunction may be directly associated with
hypomagnesemia and may be restored by dietary mg2 +
supplementation. this is consistent with previous findings
that  xxxd102xxx induced cerebral vascular dysfunction, especially severe vasospasm, ischemia, and stroke, may be
ameliorated by mg2 + supplementation (altura and altura,
1994; altura et al., 1995; ema et al., 1998).
mild hypertension following chronic ethanol ingestion
was observed in this study, consistent with previous reports
(altura and altura, 1982, 1987a; chan and sutter, 1983). as
stated earlier, the rise in blood pressure may be attributed to
several mechanisms including secretion of hormones and
neurotransmitters, stimulation of the sympathetic nervous
system, alteration of baroreceptor activity (altura and
altura, 1982, 1987a), and volume overload (chan and
sutter, 1983). the chronic ethanol ingestion-induced reduction in serum mg2 + levels observed in this study is
consistent with previous reports and may contribute to the
elevation in blood pressure (flink et al, 1953; flink, 1986;
brautbar and altura, 1987). however, a rise in blood
pressure following chronic ethanol ingestion may occur in

248

r.a. brown et al. / european journal of pharmacology 442 (2002) 241–250

the absence of hypomagnesemia (chan and sutter, 1983). in
our study, mg2 + supplementation prevented ethanolinduced hypertension. this is supported by the fact that
mg2 + supplementation reduced the plasma ethanol level,
suggesting that mg2 + may facilitate ethanol metabolism as
reported (walker, 1994). it is not known whether the elevated liver size (liver-to-body weight ratio) in the mg2 +
supplementation group reflects an mg2 + -induced alteration
in hepatic enzymatic activity. it is worthy pointing out that
the nonsignificant decrease in body weight may have also
contributed to the enhanced ratio. in addition, other factors
such as ethanol- and/or mg2 + -induced myogenic alteration
in vascular smooth muscle cells may exist and contribute to
the blood pressure alteration.
mg2 + plays an important role in the control of vascular
smooth muscle function by modulating myogenic tone and
the contractile response to various physiological stimuli
(altura et al., 1984, 1992). a reduction of mg2 + potentiates
(altura and altura, 1978; altura et al., 1984; nishio et al.,
1988), whereas an elevation of mg2 + attenuates the vasoconstrictive response (yang et al., 2000). the chronic
ethanol ingestion-induced increase in intracellular ca2 + in
vascular smooth muscle (zhang et al., 1997) has been
shown to be a result of the hypomagnesemic defect in the
ca2 + transport mechanism, leading to vascular hyperactivity, vasoconstriction, and increased peripheral resistance
(altura and altura, 1978, 1982, 1987a, 1994; altura et al.,
1992). the present study revealed that mg2 + therapy
abolished the  xxxd102xxx induced hypertension. this result is
consistent with previous reports (altura and altura, 1987a,
1994; brown et al., 1998) and further supports the important
role of mg2 + metabolism in alcoholism-related vascular
dysfunction.
one important finding from our study is that the altered
vasoconstrictive response to kcl and norepinephrine following chronic ethanol consumption was prevented by
dietary mg2 + supplementation. although the mechanism(s)
behind the disparate vasoconstrictive responsiveness between kcl and norepinephrine is not fully understood,
several potential explanations may be considered. vasoconstriction has been shown to increase when the ratio of
k + /mg2 + concentration rises, depicting an interaction between the two ions in the control of vascular tone (murakawa
et al., 1988). high extracellular mg2 + interferes with ca2 +
entry through voltage-dependent ca2 + channels (delpiano
and altura, 1996). both of these mechanisms infer an
augmented vasoconstrictive response to kcl (which depolarizes the plasma membrane) following chronic ethanol
ingestion-induced mg2 + deficiency, corresponding with the
increased blood pressure. on the other hand, the observation
that ethanol ingestion attenuated the norepinephrine-induced
vasoconstriction may indicate a reduced level or function of
adrenoceptor or post-receptor signaling mechanisms.
reduced extracellular mg2 + levels may directly lead to a
rise in nuclear and perinuclear free ca2 + via an extracellular
ca2 + -dependent mechanism (altura et al., 2001). it is

possible that the overloaded intracellular compartment(s)
may therefore lose sensitivity to norepinephrine stimuli.
this may be supported by the notion that subtle changes
in extracellular mg2 + significantly affect the contractile
response to norepinephrine, likely through modification of
the ca2 + availability rather than binding of norepinephrine
to its receptor (altura and altura, 1978, 1982; chan and
sutter, 1983). it is worthy pointing out that other ethanolrelated mechanisms may have also contributed to the altered
vascular response to norepinephrine. reduced extracellular
mg2 + levels potentiate (instead of attenuate) norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction (turlapaty and altura, 1980).
the  xxxd3000xxx -induced blockade of the norepinephrine
response favors a predominant role of a1-adrenoceptor in
the response discussed here. the similarity in the vasoconstrictive response to norepinephrine or kcl among all
groups with denuded endothelium suggests that the altered
vasoconstrictive response following ethanol ingestion may
be endothelium-dependent. furthermore, the fact that dietary mg2 + supplementation was capable of restoring the
 xxxd102xxx induced alteration in vasoconstrictive response confirms that mg2 + ion is crucial in the regulation of intracellular ca2 + homeostasis in the vascular endothelium
(altura et al., 1992; yang et al., 1999).
the attenuated endothelium-independent vasorelaxant
response to sodium nitroprusside observed in our study
indicates impaired vasodilatation following chronic ethanol
consumption. interestingly, the endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation to carbamylcholine chloride in the chronic ethanol ingestion group was similar to that of the control group,
consistent with mg2 + deficiency (nishio et al., 1988). these
data favor chronic ethanol consumption interfering with the
sensitivity of no rather than the production of endogenous
no. several mechanisms may be postulated for the reduced
no responsiveness including altered  xxxg1587xxx  activity or other down-stream no pathways such as decreased  xxxg1743xxx  kinase and g-kinase efficacy. ethanol has been shown to
elicit a biphasic effect on microcirculation, blood flow, and
blood pressure. the vasodilatory effect of ethanol may be, in
large part, a consequence of its direct actions on vascular
smooth muscle cells (altura and altura, 1982). paradoxically, certain doses of ethanol over a long-term may also
induce vasoconstriction on peripheral blood vessels, the
effects of which are dependent on intracellular free ca2 +
(altura and altura, 1982; yang et al., 2001). it is believed
that no plays a critical role in the  xxxd102xxx induced microcirculatory and vascular contractile response (yang et al.,
2000, 2001). ethanol (e.g., red wine) induces endothelial
generation and release of no, a potent vasodilator through
cgmp production. on the other hand, excessive no synthesis and the subsequent generation of reactive oxygen
species have also been reported under chronic ethanol
ingestion and may contribute to endothelial dysfunction
(zima et al., 2001). it has been speculated that the endothelial
function under chronic ethanol ingestion may be regulated by
the levels of mg2 + . recently, alturas’ group demonstrated

r.a. brown et al. / european journal of pharmacology 442 (2002) 241–250

that extracellular mg2 + ions induce both endotheliumdependent and -independent relaxation in rat aorta through
a no-dependent pathway (altura and altura, 1987b; yang et
al., 2000). their findings indicated that ca2 + -activated k +
channels and elevation of intracellular ca2 + as well as
release of no are responsible for the mg2 + -evoked vasorelaxation.
one of the limitations of the current study is that the aorta
is essentially a large conduit vessel with a minor contribution
to the total peripheral resistance and, therefore, blood pressure regulation. although the use of aortic rings to examine
vascular responsiveness has long been a generally accepted
practice, caution must be taken for data interpretation. future
investigations using models of small resistance vessels, such
as tail and mesenteric arteries, are warranted.
in summary, chronic ethanol consumption alters both
vasoconstrictive and vasorelaxant responses, while dietary
mg2 + supplementation attenuates such impairment. the
loss and restoration of mg2 + may affect the mg2 + -regulated intracellular ca2 + mobilization, ion channel function,
protein synthesis, and contractile protein sensitivity, leading
to altered vascular response. in addition, little evidence is
available regarding the role of ethanol metabolites such as
acetaldehyde and acetate in chronic ethanol ingestioninduced vascular dysfunction (altura and altura, 1982).
further studies are warranted to define the intracellular
ca2 + mobilization mechanism, the pathogenic significance
of ethanol metabolic products, and therapeutic potential
involving mg2 + in the pathogenesis and prevention of
vascular dysfunctions in alcoholism.
