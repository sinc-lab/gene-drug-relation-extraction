abstract
antifolate drugs inhibit malarial  xxxg631xxx  (dhfr). in plasmodium falciparum, antifolate resistance has been
associated with point mutations in the gene encoding dhfr. recently, mutations at homologous positions have been observed
in the p. 6i6ax gene. since p. 6i6ax cannot be propagated in a continuous in vitro culture for drug sensitivity assays, the kinetic
properties of dhfr were studied by expression of the dhfr domain in escherichia coli. induced expression yielded a protein
product that precipitated as an inclusion body in e. coli. the soluble, active dhfr recovered after denaturation and renaturation
was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography. kinetic properties of the recombinant p. 6i6ax dhfr showed that the
wild-type dhfr (ser-58 and ser-117) and double mutant dhfr (arg-58 and asn-117) have similar km values for dihydrofolate
and nadph. antifolate drugs (pyrimethamine, cycloguanil, trimethoprim, and methotrexate), but not  xxxd1672xxx  (parent
compound of cycloguanil) inhibit dhfr activity, as expected. the kinetics of enzyme inhibition indicated that point mutations
(ser58arg and ser117asn) are associated with lower affinity between the mutant enzyme and pyrimethamine and cycloguanil,
which may be the origin of antifolate resistance. © 2001 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
 xxxd2146xxx  is an essential cofactor required for the
biosynthesis of various metabolites. higher eukaryotes,
including humans, are dependent on the exogenous
source of folate in the diet. by contrast, many microorganisms, including prokaryotes and some lower eukaryabbre6iations: dhfr,  xxxg631xxx ; dhps, dihydropteroate synthase; paba, para-aminobenzoic acid; ts, thymidylate syntase; pvdhfr, dhfr derived from p. 6i6ax.

otes, such as protozoa, are able to synthesize  xxxd2146xxx 
de novo from para-aminobenzoic acid (paba) and
gtp. in the apicomplexa parasite plasmodium, folate
biosynthesis is an absolute requirement for pyrimidine
biosynthesis since the parasite lacks the ability to salvage pyrimidine nucleosides from the host cell and
obtains folate only partially from its own pool of
metabolites. this difference has been exploited to develop antifolate drugs, which specifically inhibit the
enzymes of the folate biosynthetic pathway in infectious
microorganisms. the antifolate antimalarial drugs currently used for treatment are synergistic combinations
of sulfonamides (sulfadoxine, sulfalene, sulfamethoxazole) or sulfones (dapsone) and derivatives of pyrimidine (pyrimethamine, trimethoprim).  xxxd1672xxx 
(biguanide), in combination with chloroquine (4-aminoquinoline), is used exclusively for chemoprophylaxis.

sulfonamides are structural analogs of paba that inhibit 7,8-dihydropteroate synthase (dhps; ec
2.5.1.15), an enzyme which regulates the early step of
folate biosynthesis. pyrimethamine, trimethoprim, and
cycloguanil (biologically active metabolite of  xxxd1672xxx )
inhibit  xxxg631xxx  (dhfr;  xxxd3334xxx :nadp+ oxidoreductase, ec 1.5.1.3), which
catalyzes nadph-dependent reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. the sequential inhibition of the
enzymes by the drug combination results in the deprivation of  xxxd3364xxx  monophosphate, leading to
growth inhibition of the parasites.
pyrimethamine alone and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
drug combination had been known to be highly active
against plasmodium falciparum until the emergence of
drug-resistant strains in the amazon basin and southeast asia in the 1950s and 1960s, initially observed after
monotherapy and later even with the combination therapy [1]. by contrast, it has been observed in early
clinical trials that pyrimethamine, alone or in combination with sulfonamides, is clinically less effective against
p. 6i6ax infections. in both malaria species, clinical
cases of drug resistance were reported within one or
two years whenever antifolate drugs have been massively employed in an endemic area [1].
in recent years, the molecular basis of resistance to
sulfonamides and dhfr inhibitors (pyrimethamine
and cycloguanil) has been elucidated in p. falciparum.
key point mutations leading to the substitution of
amino acid residues bordering the active site of drug
targets, dhps and dhfr, play a predominant role in
determining resistance to both drugs. these amino acid
substitutions lead to a diminished affinity of altered
enzymes for antifolate drugs. experimental evidence
accumulated so far supports the hypothesis that
pyrimethamine resistance in p. falciparum is determined
primarily by a ser108asn substitution in dhfr and
that additional mutations, asn51ile, cys59arg, and
ile164leu, further increase the level of pyrimethamine
resistance [2–5]. in addition to these mutations, a
cys50arg mutation that has been discovered recently in
bolivian p. falciparum isolates shows an increase in the
in vitro resistance to pyrimethamine and cycloguanil in
yeast transformed by a vector carrying p. falciparum
dhfr insert [6].
in our earlier study, we have isolated, cloned, and
sequenced the 1878-bp p. 6i6ax dhfr-ts gene [7]. as in
other protozoa, p. 6i6ax dhfr and  xxxg2366xxx  (ts; 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate: dump cmethyltransferase,  xxxg2366xxx ) are encoded by a single
gene expressed as a bifunctional enzyme, whereas in
most organisms, dhfr is a monofunctional monomer.
the dhfr and ts domains of the gene encode 237
and 286 amino acid residues, respectively, with a linkage sequence of 100 amino acids between the two
domains. alignment of the deduced amino acid se-

quences of the dhfr domain from 30 p. 6i6ax isolates
originating from different geographic locations has
demonstrated that all pyrimethamine-resistant isolates
carry the amino acid substitution ser117asn, which is
homologous to the ser108asn key amino acid substitution in pyrimethamine-resistant p. falciparum strains
[8,9]. furthermore, mutant dhfr alleles of some p. 6i6ax
isolates were characterized by the presence of additional
amino acid substitutions ser58arg and ile173leu,
which correspond to cys59arg and ile164leu in the p.
falciparum dhfr gene, respectively. these observations
suggest
that
the
underlying
mechanism
of
pyrimethamine resistance may be similar in p. falciparum and p. 6i6ax.
in the present study, we report the heterologous
expression of the p. 6i6ax dhfr using a pcr-amplified dhfr fragment inserted into escherichia coli pet
expression vector and the purification procedures of the
expression product. to confirm the direct implication
of ser58arg and ser117asn amino acid residue substitutions in pyrimethamine resistance, the kinetic properties of wild-type and mutant p. 6i6ax dhfr were
determined in the presence of its natural substrates and
antifolate drugs.

2. materials and methods

2.1. parasite dna
since p. 6i6ax cannot be easily maintained in continuous in vitro culture, p. 6i6ax-infected venous blood
samples were collected from european patients consulting bichat-claude bernard hospital in paris, france,
and burmese patients treated at the dawae district
hospital in burma. parasite dna was obtained from
patient blood samples by phenol –chloroform extraction method [7]. in our earlier studies, the complete
dna sequences of the dhfr domain were determined
from 30 p. 6i6ax isolates [7,8]. ari/pakistan isolate
(ser-58/ser-117) and bur-1/burma isolate (arg-58/
asn-117) represent the pyrimethamine-sensitive and
pyrimethamine-resistant dhfr-ts genetic profiles,
respectively.

2.2. p6dhfr plasmid contruct
the p. 6i6ax dhfr domain was amplified by pcr
from genomic dna of ari/pakistan and bur-1/
burma isolates. the following synthetic oligonucleotide
primers were designed from the complete p. 6i6ax
dhfr-ts sequence [7], forward primer, 5%-gggggcatatggaggacctttcagatgtatt-3% and
reverse primer, 5%-gggggggatccttacttgctgtaaaccaaaaagtccagag-3%. the nucleotides of
the forward primer in small letters correspond to a nde

r. tahar et al. / molecular & biochemical parasitology 113 (2001) 241–249

i restriction site, which incorporates the atg initiation
codon in frame with the dhfr coding sequence. a bam
h1 restriction site (in small letters) was introduced into
the reverse primer downstream of an in-frame termination codon (underlined) just beyond the border between
the dhfr domain and the junction domain.
the pcr was performed in a 50-ml mixture containing 500 ng of genomic dna, 15 pmoles of primers, 200
mm of each of the four deoxynucleoside triphosphates
(dntp), buffer (25 mm kcl, 5 mm (nh4)2so4, 10
mm tris, ph 8.8), 2 mm  xxxd2534xxx , and 1 u of pwo
dna polymerase (roche diagnostics, meylan,
france). the ptc-100 thermal cycler (mj research,
watertown, ma) was programmed as follows: 94°c×
2 min, 50°c×1 min, and 72°c×5 min for the first
cycle, and 94°c×1 min, 50°c ×1 min, and 72°c× 1
min for the subsequent cycles, for a total of 30 cycles,
followed by an additional extension step at 72°c× 15
min. the amplified product was gel purified, digested
with nde i and bam h1, and cloned for expression into
the corresponding restriction sites of the pet 21-b
vector (novagen). this strategy allows expression of
the recombinant protein without the t7tag and histag
of the pet vector.

2.3. protein expression in e. coli
the expression constructs, pet 21-b pvdhfr ser58/ser-117 and pet 21-b pvdhfr arg-58/asn-117,
were transformed into bl21-de3 plyss e. coli strain
(stratagen). for the negative control of recombinant
protein expression, pet vector without insert was used.
transformed bacterial clones were grown at 37°c in lb
medium containing 100 mg ml − 1 ampicillin to an absorbance at 600 nm (a600) of 0.6 – 0.8 u. protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-b-d-thio1-galactopyranoside (iptg) to a final concentration of
0.5 mm. the cells were grown for an additional 3 h at
37°c. the cells were separated by centrifugation
(8000× g for 15 min) at 4°c. the pellets were resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) solution, washed three times in pbs, and stored at
− 80°c until use.

2.4. dna sequencing
although pwo dna polymerase has a higher fidelity
than taq dna polymerase, the nucleotide sequence of
the inserts was determined for possible base misincorporation. transformed recombinant plasmid was extracted by alkaline lysis method. dna sequencing was
performed by the dideoxy chain-termination method.
both universal and internal primers were used to verify
that cloned products of the dhfr domain corresponded to the dhfr sequence determined by direct
sequencing of pcr products, except for the restriction

243

sites introduced into the insert by modifying the pcr
primers.

2.5. purification of dhfr
the protein was partially purified using the method
described by lin and cheng [10]. further purification
was performed according to the method of sirawaraporn et al. with minor modifications [11]. the bacterial
pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of 20% sucrose, 0.1
mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta), and pbs,
ph 7.5, centrifuged at 4000× g for 10 min, resuspended
in water at 0°c for 10 min to facilitate cell wall lysis,
and centrifuged at 8000× g for 10 min. the pellet was
resuspended in 10 ml of solution a consisting of 5 mm
edta, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pmsf),
20 mg ml − 1 aprotinin, and 1 mg ml − 1 leupeptin. cell
extracts were prepared by sonication with three 30-s
pulses at 30-s interval at 50 w using a w-225r sonicator (ultrasonics; plainview, ny). nucleic acids were
digested by incubating the cell debris with 40 mg ml − 1
dnase i and 130 u ml − 1 t1 rnase at room temperature for 20 min. the inclusion bodies were diluted in
solution a (w/v 1:4), centrifuged at 13 000× g for 10
min, and washed three times in pbs supplemented with
25% sucrose, 1% triton x-100, and 5 mm edta by
centrifugation at 4°c (25 000×g for 10 min). inclusion
bodies were resuspended in 10 ml of solution b (20 mm
potassium phosphate buffer, ph 7.0, 0.1 mm edta, 5
mm dithiotreitol (dtt), 200 mm kcl, 5 m guanidine
hydrochloride) and disrupted by sonication for 5 s.
after centrifugation (12 000× g for 30 min), the solution was left for 1 h at 0°c under mild agitation.
protein refolding was achieved by a 20-fold dilution in
solution b with 20% glycerol and 20 mg ml − 1 aprotinin
(without guanidine). the suspension was left overnight
at 4°c with gentle agitation and centrifuged at
13 500×g for 30 min, and the pellet was discarded.
refolded active enzyme was purified by affinity chromatography on a methotrexate-agarose column (1.0×
4.0 cm) pretreated with  xxxd2146xxx  and equilibrated with
solution b containing 0.2 m kcl. refolded protein was
circulated twice through the column at a constant flow
rate of 1 ml min − 1, washed once with solution b
containing 1 m kcl, and washed with solution b
containing 50 mm kcl until protein was undetectable
in the effluent at a280. the elution was performed with
5 mm dihydrofolate in 40 ml of buffer e (50 mm n-tris
hydroxymethyl-2-aminoethane sulfonic acid (tes), ph
7.8, 0.1 mm edta, 5 mm dtt, and 50 mm kcl) at
a flow rate of 1 ml min − 1, and 2 ml fractions were
collected. fractions (10 ml) containing dhfr activity
were pooled. dihydrofolate was removed from pooled
fractions by either dialysis or gel filtration on a sephadex g-25 column (nap-25 or pd10 column; pharmacia biotech).

2.6. protein analysis

3. results

purified protein was concentrated by filtration on a
ym10 ultrafiltration disc (millipore). sds-page and
staining with coomassie blue r250 or silver nitrate
were performed as described [12]. protein concentration
was determined by bradford dye-binding technique using the standard assay procedure (bio-rad).

3.1. cloning and expression

2.7. dhfr acti6ity assay
the specific activity of dhfr was determined by
spectrophotometry (model lambda 2, perkin elmer).
the reaction mixture (1 ml) consisted of 1 mg of enzyme, 50 mm tes (ph 6.8), 75 mm  xxxd26xxx , and 100 mm dihydrofolate. the reaction was
initiated by addition of 100 mm nadph to the mixture. the combined decrease in absorbance at 340 nm
(a340) of nadph and dihydrofolate was monitored for
2 min at 25°c. one unit of enzyme activity is defined as
the amount of dhfr required to produce 1 nmol of
product per min at 25°c using the molar extinction
coefficient differential of 12 300/m ×cm at 340 nm,
which takes into consideration the oxidation of
nadph and the reduction of dihydrofolate.

2.8. kinetic studies
michaelis –menten constant (km) values for nadph
and dihydrofolate were determined by varying the concentrations of one substrate within subsaturating range
and fixing the other substrate at a saturating concentration. for determination of kinetic parameters of
nadph, its concentration was varied from 2 to 150
mm, and the concentration of dihydrofolate was kept
constant at 160 mm. for kinetic studies of dihydrofolate, its concentration ranged between 5 and 260 mm,
and the concentration of nadph was set at 100 mm.
to calculate the km values, a least-square nonlinear
curve describing the michaelis – menten equation was
fitted to the data using the kaleidagraph software
(synergy software, inc., pa).

2.9. inhibition assay
the inhibition of dhfr activity (ki ) by
pyrimethamine,
cycloguanil,
trimethoprim,
and
methotrexate was studied by determining the activity of
dhfr at a constant saturating concentration of
nadph (100 mm) and various dihydrofolate concentrations, ranging from 10 to 260 mm, in the presence of
several fixed concentrations of dhfr inhibitors. the
concentrations of antimalarial drugs that reduce vmax
from 10–40% were used in the experiments. ki values
were calculated from the lineweaver – burk equation.

based on our full-length p. 6i6ax dhfr-ts gene sequence, including the 5%-end non-coding region, and
amino acid sequence alignment with the dhfr-ts gene of
other plasmodium species, the dhfr domain of the
bifunctional enzyme was determined to lie between
residues 1 and 237 (ari/pakistan isolate) or 222 (bur1/burma isolate). this fragment (666 or 711 bp) was
amplified from genomic dna by pcr using primers
that incorporate nde i and bam h1 sites at the 5% and
3% ends, respectively, and the translation termination
codon taa just after the dhfr domain. the optimal
pcr amplification conditions were determined to yield
a single product of the expected size. the pcr product
was purified from agarose gel, digested with nde i and
bam h1, and inserted in the pet 21-b e. coli expression vector to yield two constructs, pet 21-b pvdhfr
ser-58/ser-117 (wild-type enzyme from ari/pakistan
isolate) and pet 21-b pvdhfr arg-58/asn-117 (double mutant enzyme from bur1/burma isolate). these
constructs were initially transformed into top 10 f’ e.
coli cells (invitrogen) for propagation and confirmation
of their nucleotide sequences. in addition to the nucleotide differences at positions 58 and 117, these two
constructs differ in the number of ggdn repeat units
in the region between codons 88 and 106. this motif is
repeated three times in the wild-type isolate and two
times in the mutant isolate. further experiments with
top 10 f’ cells indicated that the expression level of the
recombinant protein is low.
subsequent experiments on the expression of p. 6i6ax
dhfr were performed in bl21-de3 plyss cells. the
dhfr gene in pet 21-b vector was placed under the t7
promoter that is recognized by t7 rna polymerase
but not by e. coli rna polymerase. the e. coli strain
used for our expression studies expresses a low level of
t7 lysozyme, which inhibits t7 rna polymerase during bacterial growth, diminishing the risk for cellular
toxicity due to the overexpressed protein. t7 lysozyme
also acts on bacterial membranes and facilitates protein
purification. when the dhfr gene was induced, a 30 kda
protein accumulated to about 20–30% of the total
cellular protein detectable by sds-page stained with
coomassie blue in e. coli transformed with the recombinant vector, but not in e. coli transformed with the
vector without insert (fig. 1). the yield with bl21-de3
plyss cells is about five times as much as that of top
10 f’ cells. analysis of the soluble and insoluble fractions of the bacterial culture indicated that the expression product was concentrated within the insoluble
inclusion bodies (data not shown).

analysed on sds-page. lane a, molecular mass standards (biorad).

3.2. purification and characterization of the p. 6i6ax
dhfr
the recombinant protein in the inclusion bodies of e.
coli was inactive, requiring solubilization in 5 m
guanidine hydrochloride as denaturant and protein refolding by dialysis and dilution in the refolding buffer
c solution (200 mm kcl, 20 mm potassium phosphate, ph 7.0, 100 mm edta, and 10 mm dithiotreitol). the partial purification of the protein from
inclusion bodies by unfolding and refolding allowed the
recovery of an active dhfr, which was stable for
several months when stored at −20°c.

245

the refolded recombinant dhfr was further
purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on
methotrexate-sepharose column equilibrated with
buffer c with 0.05 m kcl. our initial experiments
showed that an irreversible binding occurred between
dhfr and methotrexate, yielding a very low quantity
of active protein even with a high concentration (4
mm) of dihydrofolate in the elution buffer. to reduce
the high binding force, the column was pre-treated with
 xxxd2146xxx , and a higher concentration of kcl (increased
from 50 to 200 mm) was added to the elution buffer.
furthermore, the remaining protein was eluted with a
denaturing buffer containing 5 m guanidine hydrochloride. these modifications allowed a considerable increase in the yield of purified, active protein. the
recombinant dhfr was separated from its natural
substrate by loading the active fractions onto a gel
filtration column. the yield of the active enzyme at
different steps of purification is summarized in table 1.
the predominant protein in the purified material was a
30 kda band on sds-page and coomassie blue
staining, corresponding to the p. 6i6ax recombinant
dhfr (fig. 2). the final yield of the purified p. 6i6ax
recombinant dhfr was approximately 0.5 –1.5 mg for
1 l of e. coli culture.

3.3. kinetic properties
kinetic constants of the p. 6i6ax dhfr were determined from the enzymatic activity of the wild-type and
mutant p. 6i6ax dhfr expressed and purified in the
same experiments for comparison. the protein purified
from the wild-type, pyrimethamine-sensitive p. 6i6ax
showed similar activities as those of the protein purified
from mutant pyrimethamine-resistant p. 6i6ax. the apparent km values for dihydrofolate and nadph measured at ph 7 and 37°c are summarized in table 2.
the effects of ph and temperature on the activity of
the wild-type and mutant dhfr were evaluated. the
activity of dhfr was determined between ph 3 and 9.
the enzymatic activity diminished considerably within
the acidic and basic ph ranges (data not shown). the
optimal enzymatic activity was observed at ph 6.8.

the km values did not vary with temperature changes.

3.4. enzyme inhibition by antifolates
the kinetics of enzyme inhibition by antifolates was
evaluated using a lineweaver – burk plot (fig. 3). ki
values for pyrimethamine, cycloguanil, trimethoprim,
and methotrexate were higher for the mutant enzyme
than for the wild-type (table 2). pyrimethamine inhibited the wild-type dhfr with a ki of 64 nm and
mutant dhfr with a ki of 930 nm. similar ki values
(67 nm for wild-type and 743 nm for mutant dhfr)
were obtained with cycloguanil. trimethoprim inhibited
the wild-type dhfr at a slightly higher ki (98 nm)
and inhibited the mutant dhfr (ki =143 nm) to a
similar extent (i. e. less than 2-fold difference in ki ).
likewise, methotrexate was a potent inhibitor of the
recombinant p. 6i6ax dhfr and inhibited the wildtype (ki =5.2 nm) and mutant dhfr (ki =6.9 nm) to
a similar extent. in addition, the lineweaver –burk
plots indicate that pyrimethamine and cycloguanil are
non-competitive inhibitors for the two enzymes. however, the lineweaver – burk plots for trimethoprim
(data not shown) suggests that trimethoprim is a substrate competitor for the wild-type enzyme but a noncompetitor for the mutant. methotrexate is a substrate
competitor for the two enzymes at low concentration
but at concentrations above 10 nm, our data (not
shown) suggest that it becomes a non-competitive inhibitor.  xxxd1672xxx , the parent compound of cycloguanil
that is metabolized to a biologically active form,
showed no inhibitory effect on either the wild-type or
the mutant dhfr (data not shown).

4. discussion
in earlier studies, the biochemical properties of p.
falciparum dhfr were determined on crude extracts
or partially purified enzyme prepared from a large-scale
in vitro culture [13 –17]. since p. 6i6ax cannot be
maintained in a continuous in vitro culture with ease
[18], large quantities of parasite proteins cannot be
obtained for direct studies using this strategy. more
recent studies on p. falciparum dhfr have resorted to
heterologous systems, including e. coli and saccharomyces cere6isiae [6,11,19 –22]. some of the earlier
attempts to express p. falciparum dhfr in e. coli have
been unsuccessful or have provided low amounts of
enzyme. the possible reasons include the high at
content or toxicity of the gene product for bacteria [20].

however, a high at content may not, in itself, fully
explain the inefficient expression of the p. falciparum
enzymes since some enzymes, such as hypoxanthine
phosphoribosyl transferase and aldolase, have been expressed in large quantities in spite of a high at content
in the corresponding gene [23,24]. other possible explanations include inefficient transcription and/or translation and degradation of mrna and/or expressed
protein in bacteria. the technical difficulty of expressing p. falciparum dhfr gene has been overcome by
constructing an artificial dhfr gene based on the codons
used frequently by e. coli [11,21]. recently, however,
hekmat-nejad et al. [25] have demonstrated that native
p. falciparum dhfr sequences can be cloned into a t7
promoter-based expression plasmid for overproduction
of the expression product in e. coli. in our study on p.
6i6ax, naturally occurring codons were also used for
expression in e. coli. there was no apparent toxic effect
of highly expressed recombinant dhfr on e. coli. the
major underlying reason may be related to the relatively high gc content of the p. 6i6ax gene (50.8%), as

247

compared with that of p. falciparum homologue
(25.4%) [7].
in protozoa, dhfr and ts are on a single polypeptide with a linker region between the two domains [26].
dna sequence of the p. 6i6ax dhfr-ts gene also suggested that these two enzymes are physically linked and
bifunctional in p. 6i6ax [7]. earlier expression studies
on the p. falciparum dhfr and ts, either as a bifunctional protein or separately, have suggested that the ts
domain and the junctional sequence are not essential
for the dhfr activity [11,21]. in addition, kinetic
properties of recombinant p. falciparum dhfr domain alone and those of the bifunctional dhfr-ts are
similar [11]. based on these observations, we have
limited our experiments to the activity of dhfr by
introducing a stop codon just after the dhfr domain
of the dhfr-ts gene. as in the case of a construct
containing just the dhfr domain of the p. falciparum
dhfr-ts gene expressed in e. coli, the p. 6i6ax enzyme
was produced but was mostly sequestered in an aggregated inactive form in inclusion bodies [11,20]. further
treatment was necessary to solubilize and reactivate the
enzyme.
our kinetic studies showed that km values for the
wild-type and mutant p. 6i6ax enzymes are similar for
both dihydrofolate and nadph substrates. in studies
conducted by sirawaraporn et al. [11,19], lower km
values (range 1–24.7 mm for dihydrofolate and 1.1 –9.7
mm for nadph) were obtained with p. falciparum
recombinant dhfr. in their studies, recombinant
dhfr with a single mutation (ser108asn) was characterized by higher km values for both dihydrofolate and
nadph, while the km values of a double mutant
(ser108asn+ asn51ile) were even lower than those of
a wild-type dhfr. in another expression study [21],
the km values (67 mm for dihydrofolate and 90 mm for
nadph) of the p. falciparum synthetic, recombinant
dhfr domain were within a similar range as those of
our studies. however, the km value of dhfr from
different organisms vary widely, probably due to its
dependence on ph, temperature, and urea and salt
concentrations [27,28], rendering the comparison of km
values of dhfr from different studies difficult.
the ki values for pyrimethamine, cycloguanil, and
trimethoprim were considerably higher for the p. 6i6ax
mutant enzyme than those for the wild-type dhfr.
our results are in agreement with those obtained by
other investigators for p. falciparum recombinant enzymes [11,21]. however, the ki values for the p. 6i6ax
recombinant dhfr were about 25 times higher than
those for the corresponding p. falciparum enzymes.
whether this difference between the ki values of p.
falciparum and p. 6i6ax dhfr is due to an intrinsic,
lower sensitivity of p. 6i6ax to antifolate drugs, as
observed in clinical and epidemiological studies, remains to be established [1]. the ki values for  xxxd1672xxx 

248

r. tahar et al. / molecular & biochemical parasitology 113 (2001) 241–249

were not determined since this compound has no inhibitory effect on dhfr activity, even at high concentrations (up to 800 mm). this indicates that while its
active metabolite, cycloguanil, specifically inhibits
malarial dhfr, the parent compound,  xxxd1672xxx , does
not interact with dhfr [29].
this study is the first successful attempt to clone and
express the p. 6i6ax dhfr gene in e. coli and purify the
expression product. the dhfr domain of the bifunctional dhfr-ts enzyme from two isolates, one representing the wild-type sequence and the other presenting
a double mutation, was cloned into the pet-21b vector.
these two genotypes were isolated and cloned from
naturally-occurring parasites from various geographic
origins [8]. the choice of these genotypes was based on
the sequence alignment with p. falciparum dhfr, which
suggested that, of the residues associated with antifolate
resistance (codons 16, 51, 59, 108, and 164), cys59arg
and ser108asn substitutions are homologous to the
ser58arg and ser117asn substitutions in the p. 6i6ax
gene. in p. falciparum, ser108asn substitution is the
key mutation that confers resistance to antifolates and
appear to be the first mutation that occurs, followed by
other mutations at positions 51 and/or 59, and at
position 164 after these mutations [4]. the amino acid
substitutions at codons 58 and 117 were observed frequently in our collection of naturally-occurring p. 6i6ax
parasites. the amino acid residue at position 15 in the
p. 6i6ax gene, which corresponds to residue 16 in the p.
falciparum gene, was invariant (ala). even in p. falciparum isolates, the ala16val substitution is relatively
rare, at least in africa and asia [4].
an identical ile164leu substitution occurs at position 173 in p. 6i6ax. the mutant gene from duf/
french guiana isolate with a triple mutation
(cys58arg, ser117asn, and ile173leu) and three
ggdn repeat units was also cloned into the expression
vector. however, after several experiments conducted in
identical experimental conditions as the other two dhfr
genotypes, we failed to obtain an active enzyme from
the triple mutant. dna sequencing of the mutant gene
inserted into the pet 21b vector showed no base
changes, insertions, or deletions, as compared with the
original sequence determined from genomic dna [8].
three ggdn repeat units (positions 88 – 106) were
present in both the wild-type ari/pakistan isolate and
the triple mutant duf/french guiana isolate. in other
p. 6i6ax isolates, the three ggdn units were present or
either partially or totally absent, with apparently no
influence on the key codons associated with antifolate
resistance [8]. these observations may suggest that the
triple mutant recombinant enzyme may be toxic for
transformed e. coli.
further analysis of the characteristics of the
lineweaver –burk plots suggested that pyrimethamine

and cycloguanil, which are specific inhibitors of malarial dhfr, inhibited both wild-type and mutant enzymes in a non-competitive manner. similar
observations were made for the wild-type p. falciparum
dhfr, with or without ts, as well as p. chabaudi
dhfr [19,30]. trimethoprim, a specific inhibitor of
bacterial, and to some extent, malarial dhfr, seems to
be a substrate competitor for the wild-type enzyme and
a non-competitor for the mutant enzyme. methotrexate
is a potent anti-cancer agent of mammalian cells that
inhibits wild-type and mutant enzymes at low concentrations in a competitive manner but becomes a noncompetitor at high concentrations. however, these
results with trimethoprim and methotrexate need to be
confirmed by more extensive assays since only two
concentrations of inhibitor were used and the errors at
high values of 1/v and 1/s may be substantial.
dhfr is one of the target enzymes that may be
specifically inhibited and has been clinically useful for
malaria treatment. although the emergence and spread
of antifolate resistance in malaria parasites limit the use
of pyrimethamine and  xxxd1672xxx  in some geographic
areas, the discovery that new candidate dhfr inhibitors, such as wr99210 and ps-15, retain a comparable, high activity against both the wild-type and
mutant p. falciparum dhfr in vitro provides a
promising lead for further development of novel antifolate drugs [6,22,31]. a three-dimensional model of the
p. falciparum dhfr has also provided insight into the
mechanisms of action and mechanism of resistance to
antifolates [32]. furthermore, a structural model of the
substrate binding site of p. falciparum dhfr has led
to the identification of potential lead compounds with
novel chemical structures that are effective against the
parasites carrying either the wild-type or mutant
dhfr [33]. these preliminary computer-derived models of the three-dimensional malarial dhfr structure
may lead to the development of a rational design of
future antifolate drugs. however, for a more precise
computer-assisted drug design, a large amount of
purified dhfr is required, not only for in vitro screening of novel candidate dhfr inhibitors, but also for
the determination of the x-ray crystallographic structure of the target enzyme. our study shows that this is
now feasible with the p. 6i6ax dhfr enzyme.
