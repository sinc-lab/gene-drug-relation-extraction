summary

antidepressant drugs are among the most common drugs involved in fatal
poisoning and large variations between antidepressant drugs have been noted.
despite the fact that a large number of studies have calculated a fatal toxicity
index (fti) for antidepressants, no serious attempts have been made to compare the differences in fatal toxicity against known pharmacological and toxicological differences in receptor affinity. it is potentially from such data that
screening of drugs during their pre-clinical development can be facilitated.
we examined correlations between the fti and noradrenaline (norepinephrine)/serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-ht) reuptake inhibition selectivity,
the dose that is lethal to 50% of animals (ld 50), lipid solubility, and antagonist
activity at cholinergic, histaminergic, alpha-adrenergic and gamma- xxxd2177xxx 
(gaba)a receptors or sodium and  xxxg1232xxx  blocking effects. we
obtained data on the number of fatal poisonings between 1983 and 1992 in
england and wales caused by a single antidepressant drug from the department of health in the uk. this number was divided by the number of prescriptions in england for these drugs over this time to derive a fti of deaths
per million prescriptions.
the highest ftis were for  xxxd160xxx , viloxazine, desipramine and dothiepin. lofepramine, paroxetine and fluoxetine had very low ftis. using poisson regression, there was a significant positive relationship between the fti
of antidepressant drugs and their lethal toxicity in animals, and measures of
their cardiac effects. the relative noradrenaline/serotonin reuptake inhibition,
lipid solubility and their potency at histamine h1, muscarinic and  xxxg830xxx -adrenergic
receptors had no substantial association with the fti. limited data suggest
that some cardiac effects and potency as a gaba a antagonist may be important predictors of significant toxicity. further data using standardised bioassays are needed to compare the direct cardiac effects of antidepressants.
thus, the best current pre-clinical indicator of fatal toxicity in humans is the
ld50 in animal studies. clearly, there are humane and practical reasons for

developing a better pre-clinical indicator of toxicity in overdose for this rapidly
expanding group of drugs.

antidepressant drugs are among the most common drugs involved in fatal poisonings.[1] a number of studies over the past 15 years have compared
the fatal poisonings, usually in the uk, caused by
these drugs.[2-6] these have compared drug use
with poisoning deaths to derive a fatal toxicity index (fti), generally expressed as deaths per million prescriptions. greater than 10-fold differences
in the fti have been shown between tricyclic antidepressants (tcas) and even larger differences between some tcas and newer antidepressants.
other studies, using different methodology, have
compared the fatal toxicity of antidepressants in
the us and ireland, with similar results.[7,8] a disadvantage of most of these studies is that they have
generally used prescription numbers rather than a
measure of the number of people using the drug,
although the ranking of drugs is similar when
measures of drug use are used.[4,6]
however, there have been no real efforts to explore the reasons for the observed differences in
fti. what comparisons have been done have focused on biologically implausible differences such
as the date of drug development and preference for
blockade of noradrenaline (norepinephrine) or serotonin (5-hydroxytrptamine; 5-ht) reuptake or
have only compared by drug class.[3,6] only weak
correlations were observed between the fti and
noradrenaline/serotonin reuptake inhibition selectivity,[6] and suggestions that other factors such as
lipid solubility are important have not been supported by evidence from either animal or human
toxicology studies.[9]
alternative hypotheses that could be investigated are that the fti correlates with the dose that
is lethal to 50% of animals (ld50), lipid solubility,
antagonistic activity at cholinergic, histaminergic,
alpha-adrenergic or gamma- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba)a receptors or sodium and  xxxg1232xxx  blocking
effects. the lack of precise measures of some of
these effects for many drugs will limit these com© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

parisons. however, it is potentially from such data
that the screening of drugs during their pre-clinical
development could be facilitated.
thus, the aim of this paper is to establish the
relative frequency with which antidepressant drugs
result in fatal poisoning, and to look for pharmacological/toxicological correlations with fatal toxicity.
methods
we examined data on the fatal toxicity of antidepressant drugs for the years 1983 to 1992. the
number of deaths in england and wales caused by
acute poisoning by a single drug alone with or
without alcohol (ethanol) co-ingestion was obtained from the uk office for population census
and statistics (now the office for national statistics).[4] thus, fatal poisonings caused by multiple
drugs (about 30 to 40% of the total) were excluded.
the number of prescriptions for england as supplied by the statistics division of the department
of health for these years, was used as a measure of
relative drug usage.[5] the data from 1983 to 1990
were obtained from a survey of 1 in every 200 prescriptions dispensed by community pharmacists
and appliance contractors only. the data from 1991
to 1992 cover all prescriptions dispensed by community pharmacists, appliance contractors, dispensing doctors and prescriptions submitted by
prescribing doctors for items personally administered.
for each antidepressant, we calculated a fti expressed as deaths per million prescriptions. this
was calculated by dividing the number of deaths in
england and wales over these years by the prescriptions (in england alone) for the years 1983 to
1992 (we were not able to use identical areas for
both data sets because the welsh department of
health could not supply prescription data). similarly a fti was calculated for each of the major

groups of antidepressants. 95% confidence intervals were calculated by assuming the prescriptions
(i.e. the denominator of the fti) were fixed and
that the deaths followed a poisson distribution. the
95% confidence limits were obtained for the deaths
from a table of exact confidence intervals for a
poisson distribution.[10] these limits were divided
by the prescription count to obtain the lower and
upper confidence limits for the fti.
a criticism of some previous fatal toxicity studies is that they have generally used prescriptions
rather than a measure of the number of people using the drug. [8] therefore, we also calculated the

deaths per million years of use in the uk. data on
drug usage were also obtained from intercontinental medical statistics (ims), based on the total
pack sales of tablet and capsule formulations in the
uk for these years.[11] deaths from poisoning in
scotland were obtained from the general registrars office for scotland. however, comparable
death data were not available from northern ireland which is 3.4% of the total uk pharmaceutical
market. therefore 96.6% of the total was used for
subsequent calculations. the total volume of each
drug sold was divided by the defined daily dose
(ddd)[12] for that drug to determine the number of

a who approved measure of drug use, represents
the assumed daily dose of the drug when used for
its main indication in adults. drugs sold as syrups
or parenteral preparations were excluded as these
preparations are not usually self-administered and
are rarely involved in deliberate self-poisoning.
the ddd data were converted to patient years of
use data by assuming that the ddd represented the
average prescribed daily dose for each drug. we
calculated the number of deaths per million years
of patient use for each drug for the years 1983 to
1992. permission to publish the aggregate data on
drug usage from ims was requested but has to date
not been granted. thus, this fti (deaths per million
patient years) is used only to examine the correlation with the standard fti (deaths per million prescriptions) as previously the criticism has been
made that this may not reflect patient use.

concentration (ec50) at gabaa receptors was obtained from a number of sources.[13-18] the potency
antidepressants at these receptors and reuptake inhibition is the reciprocal of these values and is expressed in units of 10-7/(ki, kd or ec50).[13-15] to

serotonin reuptake inhibition). for example, the
relative anticholinergic potency was obtained by
dividing the potency at blocking muscarinic receptors by the sum of the potency at inhibiting uptake

of noradrenaline and serotonin. measures of the
direct cardiac effects of these drugs are not available for many of them and few studies have included more than a handful of antidepressants. approximate potency of cardiac effects was derived
for some drugs from the molar concentration that
either inhibited flow through voltage gated sodium
channels by 50% or inhibited cardiac contractility
by 50%.[19-21]

it has been postulated that the major mode of
toxicity of antidepressants is a nonspecific toxic
effect caused by the dissolution of these highly
lipid soluble drugs in the lipid bilayer of cell membranes which interferes with all membrane functions.[9] the partitioning of drugs into the membrane is a function of their lipid solubility and for
the purposes of this study the octanol/water partition coefficient was used as a measure of lipid solubility.[22] according to convention, the log of the
ratio was used for comparisons. it was possible to
locate only 1 measure of membrane effects for
which the majority of antidepressants had been
measured: the inhibition [50% inhibitory concentration; ic50)] of sodium-stimulated magnesium
efflux in human red blood cells.[23]
the ld50 in mice (measured as mg/kg)[24,25]
was compared to the ddd of each drug (where this
was known). the ddd (in mg) was divided by
60kg, an average adult bodyweight, to convert it to a
mg/kg unit. the ddd/ld50 thus represents the
ddd as a percentage of the lethal dose estimated
from animal studies, and therefore the margin of
safety in overdose. the values used for all the
above comparisons are shown in appendices 1 to

statistical analysis
poisson regression was used to examine the significance of associations between the fti for each
drug and the relative potency at receptors, lipid solubility and lethal toxicity in mice. the correlation
coefficient was also calculated to give a measure
of relative importance of each variable. however,
it should be noted that the correlation coefficient
does not weight values according to the size of their
confidence interval.
results
the results are presented in tables i and ii with
the drugs listed in descending order of fti. figure
1 shows a good correlation between the ftis in
deaths per million patient years and deaths per million prescriptions. the median ratio between these
ftis was 15.3 and varied between 8.1 and 32.4.
this significantly affected the ranking for only 1
drug: dothiepin, which ranked second in deaths per
million patient years but only fourth after  xxxd160xxx , desipramine and viloxazine in deaths per million prescriptions. this discrepancy may partly re© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

flect the relatively high ddd for dothiepin
(150mg) versus desipramine (100mg) and therefore smaller prescription sizes (in ddds) for
dothiepin.
using poisson regression there were statistically significant relationships between the fti of
antidepressant drugs and their lethal toxicity in animals, relative noradrenaline/serotonin reuptake
inhibition and lipid solubility and their potency at
inhibiting dopamine reuptake, and blocking histamine h1 and  xxxg830xxx -adrenergic, but not muscarinic, receptors. the only strong association was with the
ld50 (after adjustment for ddd) [fig. 2] and there
was also a positive correlation with cardiac effects
(fig. 3). however the correlations between other
variables and the fti were either negative or very
poor (figs. 4 to 6). only 4 of the antidepressants,
 xxxd160xxx  (ec50 7.1 mumol/l), viloxazine (ec50
490 mumol/l), doxepin (ec50 7.1 mumol/l) and  xxxd2637xxx  (ec50 34 mumol/l), have gabaa antagonist
effects. doxepin and  xxxd2637xxx  are only partial
gabaa antagonists. the potency at these receptors
for each of these drugs is less than one hundredth
that of their potency at amine reuptake sites.

there was no evidence to support the importance of nonspecific membrane effects, due solely
to lipid solubility, in antidepressant toxicity. the
octanol-water partition coefficient had a very weak
correlation with the fti (fig. 7) and no correlation
with the ld50 (fig. 8). the inhibition (ic50) of sodium-stimulated magnesium efflux in human red
blood cells only correlated weakly with the fti
(fig. 9) and did not correlate with the ld50 (p =
0.43, r2 = 0.06).
discussion
our results show that, as reported previously,
there are large differences in fatal toxicity in overdose between different antidepressant drugs. there
are a number of criticisms with using ftis as a
measure of toxicity.[26] studies on other drug
classes have found that the coronial data obtained
from coroners on the cause of death may be inaccurate in a substantial proportion of cases from
a toxicological perspective.[27] also, differences in
fatal toxicity indices between drugs may be accounted for by their being more frequently taken

in overdose or by being more toxic when taken in
overdose because of the number taken, the formulation or the inherit toxicity of the medication. the
perceived risk of overdose with each drug has the
potential to confound the relationship with fatal
toxicity. thus, antidepressants with low toxicity in
overdose are preferentially prescribed to patients
at higher risk of poisoning and suicide,[28] and this
would tend to reduce differences in the fti.
however, the observed results within groups are
supported by the limited comparative clinical
data[29,30] and have a plausible biological basis.
also, the rank order of the fti of antidepressant
drugs has been very stable over time using a number of different methods and in a number of different countries.[2-8,26] thus, despite these criticisms,
the most likely explanation is that observed differences in the fti are due largely to the inherent
toxicity of the drugs and ftis remain our best measure of the relative toxicity of drugs in humans.[26]
the fti of noradrenaline and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (tcas, selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors, serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors) correlated poorly with all well described effects of antidepressants. however, the most serious

toxicity of these drugs is attributed to direct effects
on the heart and proconvulsant effects. the cardiac
effects resemble those of quinidine, however, studies on antidepressants have generally used only a
few members of the class and there is much evidence to suggest that the effects vary widely between antidepressants.[19-21]

the results of this study did not support the hypothesis that the toxicity of all antidepressants was
caused by nonspecific membrane stabilising activity from perturbations in the lipid bilayer of cell
membranes and interfering with all membrane
functions.[9] there was no correlation between fatal toxicity and lipid solubility or 1 measure of potency at inhibiting cell membrane function. it is
likely that the toxicity is caused by specific interference with a number of membrane-based ion
channels and associated receptors, in particular
those involved in cardiac conduction. the potency
of imipramine varies 100-fold in inhibiting different ion channels and the effects of dothiepin and
 xxxd2637xxx  are both quantitatively and qualitatively
different from those of imipramine.[19-21] measures
of the relative effects of antidepressants on the sodium, calcium and potassium voltage-gated ion
channels in the cardiac conduction system have not
been published, although some quinidine-like
drugs are known to block all of these channels.[29]
further data are required to determine which of
these is most important in determining toxicity in
overdose. even the imprecise and diverse measures
of cardiac effects shown in figure 3 correlate better
drug safety 1998 may; 18 (5)

prediction of fatal toxicity of antidepressant drugs

with toxicity than any of the other much better described pharmacological effects of these drugs.
proconvulsant effects are also likely to be very
important in determining toxicity, both directly
and indirectly, by increasing cardiac toxicity.[30]
 xxxd160xxx , desipramine and dothiepin are associated with a higher incidence of seizures in overdose than many other cyclic antidepressants, but
the mechanism has not been elucidated.[31,32]
 xxxd160xxx  and viloxazine had the highest estimated fti and the closely related antipsychotic
drug,  xxxd2511xxx , has the highest fti of all the antipsychotic drugs.[33] both  xxxd160xxx  and  xxxd2511xxx 
frequently cause seizures in overdose, and all 3 are
antagonists at gabaa receptors.[17] it has even
been postulated that antagonism of gabaa receptors is responsible for the antidepressant effects of
these drugs.[17] this is a plausible explanation for
both their pronounced proconvulsant effect and
high fatal toxicity. however, dothiepin and desipramine and most other antidepressants have no
gabaa antagonist effects[17] and must cause seizures through a different mechanism.
other pharmacological differences between these
drugs may be important in determining the adverse
effect profile of these drugs and compliance, but
they do not appear to be important factors in fatal
poisonings. we believe that those investigators
wishing to develop safer antidepressants related to
these agents should screen for gabaa receptor
antagonism and quinidine-like antiarrhythmic effects and examine the lethal toxicity in animals.
toxicity in overdose should be an important
consideration in the choice of first line treatment
for depression, but should be based on the data for
each individual drug and not on the therapeutic
class, or measures such as serotonin/noradrenaline
reuptake inhibition selectivity, which do not account for toxicity in overdose.
there are many factors other than toxicity in
overdose that may influence the prescribing of antidepressants.[34,35] the fti of the most toxic of
these drugs suggests they will cause death from
poisoning 1 in every 500 patient years of use. any

quency would be likely to lead to withdrawal of the
drug from the market. a change from prescribing
the most toxic to the least toxic drugs is likely to
have only a small impact on suicide rates as poisoning with antidepressants accounts for only
about 4 to 7% of suicides. however, it may be responsible for up to a third of poisonings in those
taking antidepressants.[36] this assumes that patients will not go on to complete suicide by other
means, as has been suggested (without evidence)
by a number of authors.[37] data from an unselected
group of patients who had poisoned themselves indicated that less than 1% per year will subsequently complete suicide (by any means) and
poisoning will be the usual mode of suicide.[38]
there are no data to suggest this figure is higher in
patients who overdose with antidepressants. there
may also be other important reasons for selecting
drugs with less marked direct cardiac effects in
some patient groups.[34] however, effective treatment of depression is likely to be a more important
factor in the prevention of suicide and these data
do not suggest that patients who are satisfactorily
controlled on a particular medication should be
changed to alternative medication.
conclusion
in conclusion, despite looking at a large number
of factors, the best currently available data for prospectively estimating fatal toxicity of antidepressants in humans are the ld50 values in animals
corrected for the expected dose to be used in therapy. clearly, there are humane and practical reasons for developing a better pre-clinical indicator
of toxicity in overdose for this rapidly expanding
group of drugs.
