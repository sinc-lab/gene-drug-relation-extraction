abstract
 xxxd3238xxx  is a  xxxg1602xxx  (mr) antagonist in clinical use. the compound has a very
low affinity for the  xxxg1601xxx  (gr). determinants of binding specificity of  xxxd3238xxx  to
the mr were investigated using chimeras created between the ligand-binding domains (lbds) of the mr
and the gr. these chimeras had previously been used to investigate aldosterone binding specificity to
the mr.  xxxd3238xxx  was able to compete strongly for [3h]-aldosterone and [3h]-dexamethasone
binding to a chimera containing amino acids 804–874 of the mr, and weakly for [3h]-dexamethasone
binding to a chimera containing amino acids 672–803 of the mr. amino acids 804–874 were also critical
for aldosterone binding specificity. models of the mr lbd bound to aldosterone and  xxxd3238xxx  were
created based on the crystal structure of the  xxxg1737xxx  lbd. the ligand-binding pocket of the
mr lbd model consisted of 23 amino acids and was predominantly hydrophobic in nature. analysis of
this model in light of the experimental data suggested that  xxxd3238xxx  binding specificity is not
governed by amino acids in the ligand-binding pocket.

introduction
 xxxd3238xxx  is an antagonist of the  xxxg1602xxx  (mr) used in the treatment of
hypertension due to primary aldosteronism and in
conditions of secondary hyperaldosteronism such as
cardiac or hepatic failure (doggrell & brown 2001).
the clinical use of  xxxd3238xxx  was placed in the
spotlight with the results of the rales trial (pitt
et al. 1999), which demonstrated that the addition
of  xxxd3238xxx  to the treatment regimen of
patients with severe heart failure led to a 30%
decrease in mortality. unfortunately,  xxxd3238xxx  has side-eﬀects due to its cross-reactivity with
the related  xxxg183xxx , which have limited
its clinical usefulness as an anti-mineralocorticoid.
there is a need for better, more specific mr
antagonists, and therefore a need to better
understand ligand binding to the mr.
the mr belongs to the nuclear hormone
receptor superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors. as with other members of the family,
the receptor structure can be divided into three

major functional domains (rogerson & fuller
2000). the first of these is the n-terminal domain
which contains an ‘activation function’ (af-1)
involved in transcriptional activation (rupprecht
et al. 1993a, govindan & warriar 1998, fuse et al.
2000). in the middle of the protein is the
dna-binding domain (dbd) which binds to
specific dna sequences on target genes and is also
responsible for receptor homodimerisation (liu
et al. 1996). c-terminal to the dbd is the
ligand-binding domain (lbd) which has sequences
involved in ligand binding (fagart et al. 1998),
transcriptional activation (af-2) (rupprecht et al.
1993a) and heat-shock protein (hsp) binding
(eisen & harmon 1986, nemoto et al. 1993). the
af-2 region of the mr, like other nuclear hormone
receptors, functions by interacting with coactivator
proteins (hong et al. 1997, knutti et al. 2000).
the critical function of the lbd is the binding of
ligand. in the absence of ligand, the mr exists
predominantly in the cytoplasm in a complex with
a number of hsps (nemoto et al. 1993). the
binding of hsps keeps the receptor in an inactive

state, and also maintains the lbd in a conformation
that promotes high-aﬃnity ligand binding (eisen &
harmon 1986). the binding of ligand alters the
conformation of the receptor and displaces the
hsps, which exposes sequences involved in receptor
dimerisation, nuclear localisation and dna binding. these conformational changes are also required
for the activation of the af-2 region.
of the steroid hormone receptors, the mr has
the most sequence identity with the glucocorticoid
receptor (gr) (arriza et al. 1987). this is reflected
in the overlapping binding specificities of the two
receptors. both receptors bind cortisol and
corticosterone with high aﬃnity, whereas only the
mr binds aldosterone with high aﬃnity (funder
et al. 1988). the synthetic gr agonist dexamethasone also binds to the mr with relatively high
aﬃnity (arriza et al. 1987, rupprecht et al. 1993b)
although it does not activate the mr with the same
potency as it does the gr (arriza 1991, rupprecht
et al. 1993b).  xxxd3238xxx  has a very low aﬃnity
for the gr (couette et al. 1992b). the structures of
aldosterone and  xxxd3238xxx  are shown in fig. 1.
apart from the steroid backbone, the two structures
are quite dissimilar: the aldosterone molecule
contains a hemiketal side-chain between c11 and
c18, whereas  xxxd3238xxx  contains a lactone ring
at c17 and a sulfhydryl ester side-chain at c7. in
previous work we investigated structural determinants of aldosterone binding specificity using
chimeras created between the lbds of the mr and
gr (rogerson et al. 1999). we identified a region in
the mr lbd, between amino acids 804 and 874,
that is critical for the specificity of aldosterone
binding to the mr. in the present study, we
have used the same chimeras to investigate the
binding of  xxxd3238xxx  to the mr. we have
found that  xxxd3238xxx  binds strongly to a
chimera containing amino acids 804–874 of the
mr, and weakly to a chimera containing amino
acids 672–803 of the mr. these results are
discussed in relation to a model of the mr lbd
structure created from the crystal structure of the
 xxxg1737xxx  (pr) lbd.

ligand-binding competition assays

ligand-binding assays were performed in transfected cos-1 cells using either [1,2,4,6,7-3h]dexamethasone (amersham biosciences, amersham,
bucks, uk) or [1,2,6,7-3h]-aldosterone (amersham
biosciences). cells were grown at 37 c in dulbecco’s
modified eagles’ medium (dmem) supplemented
with 1 mm glutamine, non-essential amino acids,
1% penicillin–streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine
serum (fbs). the cells were trypsinised and
replated in six-well plates at a density of 2105
cells/well. after 20–24 h, the cells were transfected
with the expression plasmid using fugene 6 (roche
molecular biochemicals, indianapolis, in, usa)
and then incubated overnight in dmem+2%
fbs. the medium was replaced with dmem 1 h
before the ligand-binding assay. the cells were
washed three times with ice-cold phosphatebuﬀered saline (pbs) then 3h-labelled steroid was
added in dmem. non-specific binding was
assessed by adding a 500-fold excess of nonradioactive steroid. the cells were incubated at
37 c for 1 h. cells were then washed three times
with ice-cold pbs and then lysed using 1 m
naoh. the suspension was added to scintillant
and radioactivity was measured in a packard 2500
tr liquid scintillation counter. scatchard analysis
of [3h]-dexamethasone binding was performed
using 25, 10, 4, 1·6, 0·64 and 0·26 nm radioligand.
the ability of  xxxd3238xxx  to compete for
[3h]-dexamethasone binding was assessed using
1-, 5-, 10- and 50-fold molar excesses of the
concentration of radioligand. the ability of
 xxxd3238xxx  to compete for [3h]-aldosterone
binding was assessed using 10-, 100- and 500-fold
molar excesses of the concentration of radioligand.
statistical significance was measured by the
games–howell analysis of variance test (heterogeneous variances) using the gb-stat software
(dynamic microsystems inc., houston, tx, usa).

this structure was subsequently subjected to
minimisation using the discover 2·98 program
(accelrys inc., san diego, ca, usa). the cff91
force field was applied, using an electrostatic cutoﬀ distance of 12·0 å. minimisation followed a
protocol of initial steepest descents until the maximum derivative was less than 10·0, followed by
conjugate gradients until the maximum derivative
was less than 0·001 (kcal/molå). during this procedure, the side-chain heavy atoms of those amino
acids conserved between pr and mr were held
fixed in their positions in the x-ray crystal structure
of pr. these constraints (rigid) were applied to
prevent the model structure deviating significantly
from the pr template. in addition, a water molecule
in the ligand-binding site was also fixed. the
ligands, aldosterone and  xxxd3238xxx , were constructed from the progesterone bound in pr, and
were not constrained during the minimisation.

 xxxd3238xxx  competition for
[3h]-dexamethasone binding

to examine ligand binding to the mr, we created
a series of chimeras between the mr and gr
lbds (rogerson et al. 1999). the chimeras were
designed by dividing the lbds into four equivalent
sections. they were named using a four letter code,
corresponding to the four regions, in which ‘m’
denotes mr sequence and ‘g’ denotes gr
sequence. to examine  xxxd3238xxx  binding, the
chimeras mggg (mr amino acids 672–803),
gmgg (mr amino acids 804–874), ggmg (mr
amino acids 875–932) and gggm (mr amino
acids 933–984) were used.  xxxd3238xxx  binding
to these chimeras was examined by its ability to
compete for the binding of [3h]-dexamethasone,
as [3h]-dexamethasone binds to all the chimeras,
whereas [3h]-aldosterone only binds to the
gmgg chimera (rogerson et al. 1999). the
binding experiments were performed in transfected
cos-1 cells that lack endogenous mr and gr.
before analysis of  xxxd3238xxx  binding, the
aﬃnity (kd) of [3h]-dexamethasone binding to the
gr, mr lbd, mggg, gmgg, ggmg and
gggm chimeras was determined (table 1). only

and the mr lbd were very similar, which is
consistent with a study examining the ability of
dexamethasone to compete for [3h]-aldosterone
binding to the mr and [3h]-dexamethasone
binding to the gr (rupprecht et al. 1993b). in all
cases, the hill coeﬃcients were very close to 1,
suggesting no co-operativity in binding. on the
basis of these results, the  xxxd3238xxx  competition experiments were performed using 20 nm
[3h]-dexamethasone for the gr, the mr lbd
and the mggg, gmgg and ggmg chimeras,
and 50 nm [3h]-dexamethasone for the gggm
chimera.  xxxd3238xxx  was added in 1-, 5-, 10and 50-fold molar excesses of the concentration of
radioligand used for each construct.
figure 2 shows  xxxd3238xxx  competition for
[3h]-dexamethasone binding to the mr lbd, the
gr and the mggg, gmgg, ggmg and
gggm chimeras. as expected,  xxxd3238xxx 
competed strongly for [3h]-dexamethasone binding to the mr lbd. in contrast,  xxxd3238xxx 
competed very weakly for [3h]-dexamethasone
binding to the gr. one micromolar  xxxd3238xxx  reduced [3h]-dexamethasone binding to
the gr by approximately 25%. a similar result
was obtained in another study examining the
ability of  xxxd3238xxx  to compete for [3h]dexamethasone binding to the gr (couette
et al. 1992b).  xxxd3238xxx  competed strongly for
[3h]-dexamethasone binding to the gmgg
chimera, which contains amino acids 804-874 of
the mr.  xxxd3238xxx  competed weakly, but
significantly, for [3h]-dexamethasone binding to
the mggg chimera, which contains amino acids
672-803 of the mr. in contrast,  xxxd3238xxx  did
not appear to bind to the ggmg and gggm
chimeras at the concentrations used. the approximate ic50 values of  xxxd3238xxx  competition for
[3h]-dexamethasone binding to the mr lbd and
mggg and gmgg chimeras were determined by
plotting the percentage binding against the log of
the concentration of  xxxd3238xxx  (fig. 3). the
ic50 values shown in fig. 3 are derived from the
equations of the lines. the ic50 value of 3 nm
obtained for the mr lbd was in very good
agreement with the kd value of 3 nm calculated for
[3h]- xxxd3238xxx  binding to the mr in chicken
intestine cytosols (couette et al. 1992a). this also
suggested that cos-l cells do not aﬀect access
of  xxxd3238xxx  to the receptor in the binding
assay. the ic50 value of  xxxd3238xxx  binding

to the value obtained for the mr lbd. the
ic50 value of  xxxd3238xxx  binding to the
mggg was two orders of magnitude lower than
that to the mr lbd, confirming the weak binding
of  xxxd3238xxx  to this chimera.
the ability of  xxxd3238xxx  to bind to the
gmgg chimera was then tested by its ability to
compete for [3h]-aldosterone binding. the kd
value of aldosterone binding to the gmgg
chimera is 10-fold greater than for the wild-type
mr lbd (rogerson et al. 1999). to assess
 xxxd3238xxx  binding to the wild-type mr lbd,
2 nm [3h]-aldosterone was used and, for the
gmgg chimera, 10 nm [3h]-aldosterone was
used. as shown in fig. 4,  xxxd3238xxx  was able
to compete for [3h]-aldosterone binding to both
constructs. the ic50 values of  xxxd3238xxx 
competition for [3h]-aldosterone binding were
calculated as described above (results not shown).
the ic50 values of the mr lbd and gmgg
chimera were 13 nm and 25 nm respectively.
these values were higher than the corresponding
ic50 values of  xxxd3238xxx  competition for
[3h]-dexamethasone binding, which reflects the
higher aﬃnity of aldosterone for the mr. they
were consistent with the above results, showing that
 xxxd3238xxx  had a similar aﬃnity for the mr
lbd and the gmgg chimera.

mr lbd model

using the pr crystal structure, a model of
aldosterone-bound mr lbd was generated (fig.
5a). the structure consists of 11 -helices (although
to be consistent with the pr crystal structure the
helices are labelled h1, followed by h3– xxxg1956xxx ) and
a -turn between helices 5 and 6. the binding
pocket was predicted to consist of 23 amino acids.
there are 16 hydrophobic residues in the binding
pocket: leu766, leu769, leu772 and ala773 in helix
3, trp806, met807 and leu814 in helix 5, phe829 in
the -turn, met845 and leu848 between helices 6
and 7, met852 in helix 7, leu938 and phe941 in helix
11, val954 and phe956 between helices 11 and 12,
and leu960 in helix 12. there are six polar residues
in the binding pocket: asn770 and gln776 in helix 3,
ser810 and ser811 in helix 5, and cys942 and thr945
in helix 11. finally, there is one positively charged
residue in the binding pocket: arg817 in helix 5.
figure 5b shows the positions of residues critical for
ligand binding. helix 3 (h3) lies behind the
aldosterone molecule in this representation. in this
helix, asn770 is positioned to make hydrogen bonds
with the 18- and 21-hydroxyl groups of aldosterone, and gln776 is positioned to make a hydrogen
bond with the 3-keto group of aldosterone as well
as a water molecule. helix 5 (h5) lies in front of

discussion
the mr antagonist  xxxd3238xxx  has a much
higher aﬃnity for the mr than it does for the gr
(couette et al. 1992b). this has allowed us to use
chimeras created between the mr and gr ligandbinding domains to determine sequences in the mr
that are important for  xxxd3238xxx  binding specificity. we have previously used the same
approach to investigate determinants of aldosterone
binding specificity to the mr (rogerson et al. 1999).
 xxxd3238xxx  competed potently for both [3h]dexamethasone and [3h]-aldosterone binding to the
gmgg chimera, demonstrating that the diﬀerence
in binding aﬃnity of the antagonist to the mr and
gr is conferred by amino acids 804–874 of the mr
lbd. interestingly, the same region of the mr
contains sequences critical for aldosterone binding
specificity (rogerson et al. 1999). the other three
chimeras tested in this study bind dexamethasone
but not aldosterone (rogerson et al. 1999). the
mggg chimera also binds  xxxd3238xxx , although with an ic50 value two orders of magnitude
lower than that of the mr lbd. this result suggested that amino acids 672–803 of the mr lbd
can make a weak, but still significant, contribution to
 xxxd3238xxx  binding specificity. in contrast, the
lack of binding of  xxxd3238xxx  to the ggmg and
gggm chimeras suggested that amino acids 875–
984 of the mr lbd are not involved in the diﬀerence in  xxxd3238xxx  binding aﬃnity between the
mr and gr.
to investigate the interaction of the mr lbd
with  xxxd3238xxx  we created models of the mr
lbd bound to both  xxxd3238xxx  and aldosterone,
based on the published crystal structure of the pr
lbd bound to progesterone (williams & sigler
journal of molecular endocrinology (2003) 31, 573–582

1998). in the model, amino acids 804–874 encompass -helices 5–8, although helix 8 does not form
part of the binding pocket. helix 5 and the -turn lie
on opposite sides of the steroid a ring and helix 7
abuts the steroid d-ring (fig. 5b and c). in the
binding pocket of both the aldosterone- and
 xxxd3238xxx -bound molecules there are two residues that diﬀer between the human mr and gr in
this region (corresponding gr amino acids in
brackets), ser810 (met604) and leu848 (gln642).
serine810 can be mutated with no eﬀect on the
aﬃnity of aldosterone binding (fagart et al. 1998).
interestingly, a ser810<leu mutation in the mr
has been found in eight individuals from the same
family with severe early onset hypertension (geller
et al. 2000). one consequence of this mutation is the
conversion of  xxxd3238xxx  into an mr agonist in
in vitro transactivation assays, but with no apparent
eﬀect on binding aﬃnity (geller et al. 2000). it was
concluded that the leucine mutation stabilises the
active conformation of lbd by forming a hydrophobic interaction with ala773 on helix 3 of the
protein (geller et al. 2000). leucine848 of the mr
corresponds to gln642 of the gr. in the crystal
structure of the gr lbd, this residue interacts with
the 17-hydroxyl group of dexamethasone (bledsoe
et al. 2002). it was proposed from the gr crystal
structure that steroids lacking a 17-hydroxyl, such
as  xxxd3238xxx  and aldosterone, will bind with
low aﬃnity to the gr because of the absence of this
hydrogen bond (bledsoe et al. 2002). however, corticosterone has the same aﬃnity for the human gr
as cortisol (lind et al. 2000), but also lacks the
17-hydroxyl group, arguing against this hypothesis. in the  xxxd3238xxx -bound structure, leu848
is positioned to interact with the c7 sulfhydryl-ester
side-chain. it is unlikely, however, that leu848 is
critical for the binding specificity of  xxxd3238xxx , as a glutamine residue appears in this position in the ar, which has a high aﬃnity for
 xxxd3238xxx  (corvol et al. 1975).
the inability of the mr lbd model to identify
residues involved in binding specificity suggested
that the diﬀerence in the aﬃnity of  xxxd3238xxx 
for the mr and gr is conferred by amino acids in
the (804–874) region of the mr lbd that do not
interact directly with the ligand. there are
precedents for this type of eﬀect in other steroid
hormone receptors. the specificity of dexamethasone binding to the gr involves two residues,
asp641 and leu647 (robin-jagerschmidt et al. 2000),
www.endocrinology.org

 xxxd3238xxx  binding specificity

that do not interact directly with the ligand in the
gr lbd crystal structure (bledsoe et al. 2002).
similarly, the binding of the progestin ru27987 to
the pr is conferred, in part, by a serine residue that
lies on the surface of the receptor (robinjagerschmidt et al. 2000). the guinea pig gr has a
decreased aﬃnity for glucocorticoids, due to amino
acid diﬀerences with the human sequence that
occur in a region that again does not form part of
the ligand-binding pocket (keightley et al. 1998). it
is, of course, possible that binding specificity is
conferred by amino acids in the mr ligand binding
pocket that were not identified in the model, which
was based on the pr lbd crystal structure.
because of this possibility, we subsequently
modelled the mr lbd using the recently available
co-ordinates of the gr lbd crystal structure
(bledsoe et al. 2002). it is very likely that the mr
lbd is closest in structure to the gr lbd, given
that the two proteins share 57% amino acid
identity in this domain. the amino acids that form
the binding pocket in this model are identical to
those that form the binding pocket in the model
based on the pr lbd (results not shown).
the result of the mggg chimera has demonstrated that amino acids 673–803 of the mr make a
weak contribution to  xxxd3238xxx  binding specificity. in the mr lbd model, amino acids 672–803
encompass -helices 1, 3 and 4, although only helix
3 contributes to the ligand-binding pocket. helix 3
forms one face of the pocket and is positioned to
make interaction with the a, c and d rings of
aldosterone and  xxxd3238xxx , as well as the lactone ring of  xxxd3238xxx  (fig. 5). there are two
residues that diﬀer between the human mr and gr
in this region (corresponding gr amino acids
in brackets), leu766 (met560) and ala773 (gly567).
mutagenesis and molecular modelling studies demonstrate that ala773 sterically inhibits the binding of
11-substituted spirolactones to the mr (auzou
et al. 2000).  xxxd3238xxx  itself, however, contains
no substituent at c11, so ala773 is unlikely to be
involved in binding specificity of the antagonist.
interestingly, leu766 is conserved in the ar, but not
in the gr. in the mr lbd model, leu766 lies in
close proximity to the lactone ring of  xxxd3238xxx 
(results not shown). it is therefore possible that
leu766 contributes to the binding specificity of
 xxxd3238xxx , although its contribution will be
small, due to the weak nature of  xxxd3238xxx 
binding to the mggg chimera.

a feature of mr antagonists is the presence of a
c7 side-chain. in vivo,  xxxd3238xxx  is converted
to canrenone by the cleavage of this side-chain.
canrenone has a 10-fold lower aﬃnity than
 xxxd3238xxx  for the mr (corvol et al. 1981).
therefore, hydrophobic interactions of the c7
sulfhydryl-ester side-chain with leu769, leu848 and
met852, predicted from the model, appear to be
important for the aﬃnity of  xxxd3238xxx  for the
mr, although they do not account for binding
specificity. in vivo canrenone is in equilibrium with
the open e-ring metabolite canrenoate, in which the
lactone ring has been cleaved to form a carboxylic
acid. canrenoate has a very low aﬃnity for the mr
(corvol et al. 1981). modelling of canrenoate binding (results not shown) suggests that the carboxylate
oxygens could form hydrogen bonds with the sidechain atoms of thr945 and asn770. binding of canrenoate, however, is unlikely to be energetically
favourable, as there is no compensatory positive
charge in the protein (i.e. an arginine or lysine) in
the vicinity to match the negative charge of the
carboxylate. this may explain the very low aﬃnity
of canrenoate binding to the receptor.
in summary, the same region of the mr lbd,
encompassing amino acids 804–874, is critical for
the binding specificity of the synthetic antagonist
 xxxd3238xxx  and the natural ligand aldosterone.
modelling of the mr lbd bound to the two
ligands suggests that this region forms part of the
ligand-binding pocket; however, we were unable to
identify amino acids in this region that may be
important for binding specificity. further work
using mr:gr chimeras will be needed to identify
the individual amino acids that confer ligand
binding specificity in the mr. the results of the
rales trial (pitt et al. 1999), using  xxxd3238xxx ,
and the recently completed ephesus trial (pitt
et al. 2003), using the related mr antagonist
 xxxd2010xxx , demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of
mr antagonists in the treatment of heart failure.
an understanding of the binding of  xxxd3238xxx 
to the mr may prove to be very useful in the
development of new receptor antagonists for use in
the treatment of heart failure and hypertension.
