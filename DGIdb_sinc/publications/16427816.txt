abstract
cytidine 5′-triphosphate synthase ( xxxg546xxx ) catalyzes the atp-dependent formation of ctp from utp using either nh3 or l-glutamine as the
source of nitrogen. to identify the location of the atp-binding site within the primary structure of e. coli  xxxg546xxx , we used the affinity label 2′,3′dialdehyde adenosine 5′-triphosphate ( xxxg2163xxx ).  xxxg2163xxx  irreversibly inactivated  xxxg546xxx  in a first-order, time-dependent manner while atp protected
the enzyme from inactivation. in the presence of 10 mm utp, the values of kinact and ki were 0.054 ± 0.001 min−1 and 3.36 ± 0.02 mm,
respectively.  xxxg546xxx  was labeled using (2,8-3h) xxxg2163xxx  and subsequently subjected to trypsin-catalyzed proteolysis. the tryptic peptides were
separated using reversed-phase hplc, and two peptides were identified using n-terminal sequencing (s(492)gddqlveiievpnh(506) and y
(298)ielpday(k(306)) in a 5:1 ratio). the latter suggested that lys 306 had been modified by  xxxg2163xxx . replacement of lys 306 by alanine reduced
the rate of  xxxg2163xxx -dependent inactivation (kinact = 0.0058 ± 0.0005 min−1, ki = 3.7 ± 1.3 mm) and reduced the apparent affinity of  xxxg546xxx  for both atp
and utp by approximately 2-fold. the efficiency of k306a-catalyzed glutamine-dependent ctp formation was also reduced 2-fold while near
wild-type activity was observed when nh3 was the substrate. these findings suggest that lys 306 is not essential for atp binding, but does play a
role in bringing about the conformational changes that mediate interactions between the atp and utp sites, and between the atp-binding site and
the glutamine amide transfer domain. replacement of the nearby, fully conserved lys 297 by alanine did not affect nh3-dependent ctp
formation, relative to wild-type  xxxg546xxx , but reduced kcat for the  xxxg907xxx  activity 78-fold. our findings suggest that the conformational change
associated with binding atp may be transmitted through the l10-alpha11 structural unit (residues 297–312) and thereby mediate effects on the
 xxxg907xxx  activity of  xxxg546xxx .

glutamine amide transfer (gat) domain catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamine ( xxxg907xxx  activity) to generate nascent
nh3 [3,4]. amino acid sequence similarities between gat
domains have been used to classify amido-transferases into two
well-characterized families [5,6]. the ntn glutamine am
idotransferases utilize an n-terminal cys to catalyze glutamine
hydrolysis, whereas  xxxg546xxx  belongs to the triad glutamine
amidotransferases that utilize a cys–his–glu triad. the nascent
nh3 derived from glutamine is subsequently transferred to the
n-terminal synthase domain via an nh3-tunnel [7] where it
reacts with utp that has been activated by phosphorylation at
the 4-position, to yield ctp [8,9].
 xxxg546xxx  catalyzes the final step in the de novo synthesis of
cytosine nucleotides.  xxxg546xxx  activity is elevated in some forms

of leukemia [10,11] and some solid tumors [12]. because
ctp plays a central role in nucleic acid [13] and membrane
phospholipid biosynthesis [14],  xxxg546xxx  is a recognized target
for the development of antineoplastic [13,15], antiviral [15–
17], and antiprotozoal [18–20] agents.
 xxxg546xxx  from e. coli is the most thoroughly characterized
 xxxg546xxx  with respect to its physical and kinetic properties, and
is regulated in a complex fashion [1]. gtp is required as a
positive allosteric effector to increase the efficiency (kcat/km)
of the  xxxg907xxx  activity and glutamine-dependent ctp
synthesis [21,22] but inhibits ctp synthesis at concentrations
greater than 0.15 mm [23]. in addition, the enzyme is
inhibited by the product ctp [24], exhibits negative
cooperativity for glutamine [25], and displays positive
cooperativity for atp and utp [24–26]. atp and utp act
synergistically to promote tetramerization of the enzyme to its
active form [26]. kinetic studies on  xxxg546xxx  from lactococcus
lactis have suggested that the 4-phosphorylated utp
intermediate acts as a coactivator with gtp to stimulate
glutamine hydrolysis [27]. in addition to these noncovalent
modes of regulation, the yeast enzyme encoded by the ura7
gene [28,29] and the human enzyme [30] are regulated by
phosphorylation.
recently, the x-ray crystal structures of  xxxg546xxx  from thermus
thermophilus [31] and e. coli [7,32] were solved. modeling
studies using  xxxg177xxx . coli  xxxg546xxx  (which crystallized as a tetramer
even though no nucleotides were bound) revealed that atp- and
utp-binding interactions are contributed by three monomers
[7], consistent with the observations that activity requires
tetramer formation, and that an atp/utp-dependent dimer–
tertamer equilibrium contributes to the positive cooperativity.
recently, baldwin and co-workers reported the structure of e.
coli  xxxg546xxx  complexed with the products ctp and adp at 2.8-å
resolution [32]. this structure revealed that the 2′-oh and 3′oh of adp have no direct protein contacts, but are proximal to
asp 303 and lys 306. although the crystallization was
conducted in the presence of gtp, no gtp was bound in the
crystalline enzyme. modeling studies, however, suggest that
gtp binds in a deep cleft with the leu 301 amide, and the lys
297 and arg 356 side chains interacting with the triphosphate
moiety of gtp [7].
prior to publication of the structure of unliganded e. coli
 xxxg546xxx , our interest in identifying nucleotide-binding sites on
 xxxg546xxx  led us to examine the effect of the affinity label 2′,3′-

dialdehyde adenosine 5′-triphosphate ( xxxg2163xxx ) on  xxxg546xxx 
catalysis. we chose  xxxg2163xxx  as an affinity label for  xxxg546xxx 
because it reacts with lys residues [33], and such residues
had been implicated in catalysis by thiourea dioxide labeling
[34]. this paper describes the inactivation of e. coli  xxxg546xxx 
by  xxxg2163xxx  and the isolation of a radiolabeled peptide. we
identify lys 306 as the site of labeling, consistent with the
recent x-ray crystallographic findings [32]. in addition, we
construct k306a  xxxg546xxx  and show that lys 306 plays a role
in transmission of the allosteric signal from the atp-binding
site to the  xxxg907xxx  site. using the k297a mutant, we
show that the fully conserved lys 297 plays an important
role in gtp-dependent activation of glutamine-dependent
ctp formation.
2. materials and methods
2.1. general
 xxxg2163xxx  (for preliminary studies), atp, utp, gtp, iodoacetate, dtt, tpcktreated trypsin, and all other chemicals were purchased from sigma chemical
co. (oakville, on) unless otherwise noted.  xxxg2163xxx  and [2,8-3h] xxxg2163xxx  were
prepared by sodium periodate oxidation of atp or [2,8-3h]atp (ge healthcare,
baie d'urfé, pq) using published protocols [18,35,36]. his·bind resin,
thrombin cleavage capture kits, and the pet–15b expression system were
purchased from novagen, inc. (madison, wi). the jupiter c18 column and
guard columns were purchased from phenomenex (torrance, ca). spectra/por
dialysis membranes, and amicon centriprep-30 concentrators were purchased
from fisher scientific (nepean, on). dna sequencing was conducted by the
dalhousie university-nrc institute for marine biosciences joint laboratory
(halifax, ns). hplc was conducted using two waters 510 pumps, a 680
controller, and a rheodyne 7725i sample injector.

2.2. mutagenesis
the plasmid pet15b- xxxg546xxx  [21] was used as the template for sitedirected mutagenesis. site-directed mutagenesis was conducted using the
quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (stratagene inc., la jolla, ca)
and following the manufacturer's protocol. the synthetic deoxyoligonucleotide forward (f) and reverse (r) primers used to construct the mutants
were: 5′-cggtatggtcggcgcgtacattgaactgcc-3′ (f, k297a),
5′-ggcagttcaatgtacgcgccgaccataccg-3′ (r, k297a), 5′gccggatgcttatgcatcagtgatcgaagc-3′ (f, k306a), and 5′gcttcgatcactgatgcataagcatccggc-3′ (r, k306a), where the
positions of the mismatched bases are underlined. the entire open reading
frame of the mutants was sequenced to verify that no other alterations of
the nucleotide sequence had been introduced. potential mutant plasmids
were isolated and heat shock was used to transform competent dh5alpha cells
[37]. these cells were used for plasmid maintenance.

2.3. expression and purification of  xxxg546xxx 
the wild-type and mutant forms of recombinant e. coli  xxxg546xxx  were
expressed in and purified from e. coli strain bl21(de3) cells transformed with
either the mutant or wild-type plasmid pet15b- xxxg546xxx  as described previously
[21]. the pet15b- xxxg546xxx  construct encodes the  xxxg546xxx  gene product
with an n-terminal hexahistidine (his6) tag. cleavage of the his6-tag from
soluble enzymes using biotinylated thrombin (new n-terminus, gshmlem1...,
where m1 is the first residue of wild-type  xxxg546xxx ) was carried out as described
previously [21]. the resulting enzymes were dialyzed into hepes buffer (70
mm, ph 8.0) containing edta (0.5 mm; or egta (0.5 mm) where noted) and
mgcl2 (10 mm). the results of the purification and cleavage procedures were
routinely monitored using sds-page. typically, enzyme preparations were
∼98% pure.

2.4. enzyme assays and protein determinations
 xxxg546xxx  activity was determined at 37 °c using a continuous spectrophotometric assay by following the rate of increase in absorbance at 291 nm
resulting from the conversion of utp to ctp (deltaepsilon = 1338 m−1 cm−1) [24].
the standard assay mixture consisted of hepes buffer (70 mm, ph 8.0)
containing egta (0.5 mm), mgcl2 (10 mm),  xxxg546xxx  (wild-type, 20–116 mug/
ml; k306a, 36–224 mug/ml; and k297a, 40 mug/ml), utp (1 mm or
2 mm), and atp (1 mm or 3 mm) in a total volume of 1 ml. enzyme and
nucleotides were pre-incubated together for 2.5 min at 37 °c followed by
addition of substrate (nh4cl or glutamine) to initiate the reaction. total
nh4cl concentrations in the assays were 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 125,
and 150 mm. for assays of glutamine-dependent ctp formation, concentrations of glutamine were 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, and 10 mm.
the concentration of gtp was maintained at 0.25 mm for all assays when
glutamine was used as the substrate. for assays in which either the
concentration of atp or utp was varied, the concentration of nh4cl was
fixed at 150 mm. total atp concentrations ranged from 0.1 mm to 4.0 mm
when atp was the varied substrate, and the concentration of utp was
2.0 mm. total utp concentrations ranged from 0.1 mm to 2.0 mm when
utp was the varied substrate, and the concentration of atp was 3.0 mm. in
addition, the ionic strength was maintained at 0.30 m in all assays by the
addition of kcl.
the  xxxg907xxx  activity of k297a (25 mug/ml) was assayed using hplc, as
described previously [38], and using a saturating concentration of glutamine
(10 mm) in the presence of gtp (0.25 mm) to estimate the value of kcat.
all kinetic parameters were determined in triplicate and average values are
reported. the reported errors are standard deviations. initial rate kinetic data
were fit to either eq. (1) (glutamine or nh3 as substrates) or eq. (2) (atp or utp
as substrates) by non-linear regression analysis using the program kaleidagraph v. 3.5 from synergy software (reading, pa). in eq. (1), vi is the initial
velocity, vmax is the maximal velocity at saturating substrate concentrations
(where vmax = kcat [e]t), s is the substrate (glutamine or nh3), and km is the
michaelis constant for the substrate. values of km were calculated for the
concentration of nh3 present at ph 8.0 (pka (nh+4) = 9.24; [39]). values of kcat
were calculated for  xxxg546xxx  variants with the his6-tag removed using mr values of
61 029 (wild-type) and 60 971 (k297a and k306a).

in eq. (2), vi is the initial velocity, vmax is the maximal velocity at saturating
substrate concentrations,
s ﬃis the substrate (atp or utp), n is the hill number,

and k′ (where ½s0:5 ¼ n k v) is a constant comprised of the intrinsic dissociation

using the bio-rad protein assay (bio-rad laboratories ltd., mississauga, on)
with bovine  xxxg124xxx  standards.

2.5. inactivation of  xxxg546xxx  by  xxxg2163xxx 
solutions (200 mul) containing either wild-type or k306a  xxxg546xxx  (0.5–1.0
mg/ml) and varying concentrations of  xxxg2163xxx  were incubated for 60 min at
25 °c. aliquots (20 mul) were removed at 5 or 10 min intervals and assayed to
monitor changes in enzyme activity. the residual enzyme activity was linear
implying that the 50-fold dilution was sufficient to significantly slow the rate of
inactivation. these inactivation reactions were conducted using the following
nucleotide concentrations: 10 mm utp and no atp; 10 mm utp and varying
concentrations of atp; 10 mm atp and no utp; and, no added nucleotides.

2.6. stoichiometry of  xxxg2163xxx  binding
the binding stoichiometry for  xxxg2163xxx  was determined by following the
incorporation of radioactivity into a sample of  xxxg546xxx  during the inactivation
of the enzyme.  xxxg546xxx  was incubated at 25 °c as described above, except [2,8-

201

3
h] xxxg2163xxx  (2 mm) and utp (10 mm, saturating) were present in the reaction
mixture. at various time points, an aliquot (100 mul) was removed from the
incubation mixture and the unbound radiolabel was removed by spin filtration
(see below, [41]). the filtered material was divided into three fractions
(20 mul each). one fraction was assayed for enzyme activity, the second was
used for a protein concentration determination, and the third was used for
scintillation counting. the resulting radioactivity measurements were
converted into moles of  xxxg2163xxx  bound per mole of  xxxg546xxx  monomer.

2.7. preparation of radiolabeled  xxxg546xxx 
 xxxg546xxx  (5 mg in 3 ml) was incubated with [2,8-3h] xxxg2163xxx  (2 mm) in hepes
buffer (70 mm, ph 8.0) containing edta (0.5 mm), mgcl2 (10 mm), and utp
(10 mm) at 25 °c for 120 min, after which the activity of the enzyme was
assayed to confirm complete inactivation. nacnbh3 was added to give a final
concentration of 10 mm, and the solution was kept at 4 °c for 12 h. unbound
[2,8-3h] xxxg2163xxx  and excess nacnbh3 were removed using the spin column
technique of penefsky [41]. the spin columns consisted of 5 ml syringes
containing sephadex g-50 (fine) equilibrated in assay buffer which had been
centrifuged (2 min, 200×g). samples (500 mul) were loaded onto the columns
and immediately centrifuged (2 min, 200×g). subjecting  xxxg2163xxx  solutions to this
procedure demonstrated that 100% of unincorporated  xxxg2163xxx  was retained on the
column. the filtered enzyme solution was stored at 4 °c prior to proteolytic
digestion.
the effects of atp upon incorporation of radiolabel were examined by
incubating  xxxg546xxx  as described above with the addition of atp (10 mm) to the
labeling mixture. the solution was treated with nacnbh3 and spin-filtered
as described above.

2.8. proteolytic digestion of labeled  xxxg546xxx  and peptide isolation
urea and dtt were added to the filtered [2,8-3h] xxxg2163xxx -labeled  xxxg546xxx 
solutions to give final concentrations of 6 m and 3 mm, respectively. these
solutions were incubated for 15 min at 50 °c, then cooled to room temperature
and treated with iodoacetamide (3.0 mm final concentration). after 15 min at
room temperature, the solution was dialyzed at 4 °c against hepes buffer
(70 mm, ph 8.0) containing edta (0.5 mm) and mgcl2 (10 mm). trypsin was
added using a protease to substrate mass ratio of 1:50, and the solution was then
maintained at 37 °c for 8 h. proteolytic digestion reactions were terminated by
injection onto a reversed-phase hplc (rp-hplc) column. separation of the
tryptic peptides was conducted using a jupiter c18 column (250 × 4.6 mm;
5 mum; 300 å) fitted with a guard column (4 × 3.0 mm wide pore c18). the
solvent system consisted of solvents a and b, which were 0.1% trifluoroacetic
acid in water and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile, respectively. all
solvents were filtered and degassed prior to use. typically, peptides were eluted
using a linear gradient from 5% solvent b to 90% solvent b over 60 min
followed by 15 min at 90% solvent b. the eluted peptides were detected by
monitoring the absorbance at 215 nm. the flow rate was 1 ml/min and an
automated fraction collector was used to collect fractions (1 ml) in 1.5-ml
polypropylene tubes. aliquots (10–20 mul) were subsequently removed for
liquid scintillation counting. fractions containing significant levels of
radioactivity were pooled and concentrated by evaporation under a gentle
flow of argon. n-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the isolated peptides
was performed by automated edman degradation at the eastern québec
proteomics core facility (sainte-foy, qc).

3.1. inactivation of  xxxg546xxx  by  xxxg2163xxx 
treatment of  xxxg546xxx  from e. coli with  xxxg2163xxx  (in either the
presence or absence of utp) produced time-dependent loss of
enzyme activity, which followed first-order kinetics up to at
least 90% (n3 half-lives) of the reaction. complete loss of
enzyme activity was eventually observed. the inactivation was

irreversible with no activity being recovered when totally
inactivated enzyme was dialyzed against hepes buffer (70
mm, ph 8.0) containing edta (0.5 mm) and mgcl2 (10 mm).
in the presence of utp (10 mm), inactivation of  xxxg546xxx  by  xxxg2163xxx 
showed saturation kinetics (fig. 1), suggesting initial reversible
formation of an enzyme–inactivator complex as shown in
scheme 2. the formation of the reversible complex, according
to the treatment of kitz and wilson [42], is in rapid equilibrium
compared with the rate of formation of irreversibly inactivated
enzyme. the kinetic mechanism is described by eq. (3). in the
presence of a saturating concentration of utp (10 mm), the
values for ki and kinact were 3.36 ± 0.02 mm and 0.054 ± 0.001
min−1, respectively.

the inactivation of  xxxg546xxx  by  xxxg2163xxx  proceeded quite differently in the absence of utp. although the inactivation was still
time-dependent and followed first-order kinetics, the observed
rate of inactivation was much more rapid. the plot of kobs against
[ xxxg2163xxx ] (fig. 2) revealed that at low concentrations of  xxxg2163xxx , the
value of kobs rises sharply with small increases in  xxxg2163xxx 
concentration, but reaches an upper limit of approximately
0.092 min−1 at an  xxxg2163xxx  concentration of 0.5 mm. at this

and ▿, 8 mm) at 25 °c. aliquots were assayed for nh3-dependent  xxxg546xxx 
activity at the times shown. (b) dependence of apparent first-order rate constant
(kobs) for inactivation of  xxxg546xxx  inactivation on  xxxg2163xxx  concentration. the rates of

linear regression fits of plots of ln (% activity) against time. non-linear
regression analysis was used to fit the data to eq. (3). the values of ki and kinact
were 3.36 ± 0.02 mm and 0.054 ± 0.001 min−1, respectively.

concentration of  xxxg2163xxx , the rate of inactivation is approximately
15-fold greater than the rate observed when utp (10 mm) is
present. at concentrations of  xxxg2163xxx  above 0.5 mm, the value of
kobs for  xxxg546xxx  inactivation decreased, finally leveling off with a
value of approximately 0.04 min−1. this value is similar to the
measured value of kinact for the inactivation of  xxxg546xxx  in the
presence of utp. this complex dependence of kobs on the
concentration of  xxxg2163xxx  likely reflects different reactivities of
the monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric species of  xxxg546xxx  that
exist in equilibrium in solution [43] and/or additional reactions
at the utp-, or ctp-, or gtp-binding site(s). when the ability of
 xxxg2163xxx  (0–20 mm) to serve as a substrate was examined, no ctp
formation was detected in the presence of glutamine (10 mm),

1 mm; ▵, 2 mm; □, 3 mm; ■, 5 mm; and ♦, 8 mm) at 25 °c. aliquots were
assayed for nh3-dependent  xxxg546xxx  activity at the times shown. (b) dependence
of the apparent first-order rate constant (kobs) for  xxxg546xxx  inactivation (in the
absence of utp) on  xxxg2163xxx  concentration. the rates of inactivation of  xxxg546xxx  at
various  xxxg2163xxx  concentrations in the absence of utp were determined from linear
regression fits of plots of ln (% activity) against time. the value of kobs for  xxxg546xxx 
inactivation increased with increasing concentrations of  xxxg2163xxx  to a maximum of
0.092 min−1. at concentrations of  xxxg2163xxx  above 0.5 mm, the value of kobs
decreased to a constant value of approximately 0.04 min−1.

utp (1 mm), gtp (0.15 mm), and wild-type  xxxg546xxx  (42 mug/ml).
hence, it is unlikely that this effect arises from substrate
utilization since  xxxg2163xxx  does not appear to support glutaminedependent ctp formation.
3.2. effect of atp on inactivation
atp protects  xxxg546xxx  from inactivation by  xxxg2163xxx  (fig. 3).
increasing concentrations of atp caused a decrease in the rate
of inactivation (kobs) as shown in fig. 3b. the apparent affinity
of  xxxg546xxx  for atp was estimated to be 0.39 mm and this value is
in good agreement with the [s]0.5 value of 0.49 mm for atp
reported in table 1.
the protective effect of atp was further demonstrated by
incubating  xxxg546xxx  with varying concentrations of  xxxg2163xxx  in the
presence of saturating atp (10 mm) (fig. 4). in the presence of
atp (10 mm), the rate of inactivation of the enzyme is linearly
proportional to the concentration of  xxxg2163xxx . this suggests the
saturation of atp-binding sites by atp, while the  xxxg2163xxx  reacts
non-specifically either at low-affinity sites or in a bimolecular
reaction with  xxxg546xxx . the inactivation of  xxxg546xxx  by 0.5 mm  xxxg2163xxx 
can be virtually “competed out” by 10 mm atp, which provides
almost complete protection against inactivation (i.e.,
kobs = 0.001 min−1 (fig. 4) as opposed to 0.092 min−1 (fig. 2)

in the absence of nucleotides). hence, there is an approximately
90-fold reduction in the rate of inactivation of  xxxg546xxx  by  xxxg2163xxx 
(0.5 mm) when atp (10 mm) is present.

increases linearly with the concentration of  xxxg2163xxx  over the range of 0 to 10 mm
and saturation was not observed. the slope of the line in panel b gives a value
for the apparent kinact/ki equal to 0.0019 mm−1 min−1. this value is an order of
magnitude less than that observed in the absence of atp (i.e., kinact/ki = 0.016
mm−1 min−1; see fig. 1).

complex inactivation behavior exhibited in the absence of utp
(i.e., fig. 2b)) and treated with nacnbh3 to reduce the putative
schiff base of the adduct (if present; see discussion). the
enzyme was denatured with urea, reacted with iodoacetamide,
and then digested with trypsin before injection onto the rphplc column. the resulting uv and radioactivity profiles are
shown in fig. 5. the uv profile (fig. 5a) shows numerous
peaks representing the many tryptic peptides that resulted from
the extensive digestion of  xxxg546xxx  by trypsin. the most
significant amount of radioactivity was contained in fractions
27 to 32 (fig. 5b). these fractions were pooled, lyophilized,
and stored at −20 °c.
in order to examine the effect of atp on the incorporation of
radiolabel into  xxxg546xxx , the radiolabeling reaction was conducted
in the presence of saturating utp (10 mm), and in the presence
of both saturating utp (10 mm) and atp (10 mm). after
radiolabeling, proteolysis and rp-hplc separation of the
tryptic peptides were conducted as described above. the two
radioactivity profiles are shown in fig. 5c. a marked decrease
in the amount of radioactivity incorporated into  xxxg546xxx  was
observed when the radiolabeling was conducted in the presence

of saturating atp. the greatest reduction (over 2-fold) occurs in
the peak region of the profile, which indicates that the radiolabel
is likely incorporated into peptide(s) residing in these fractions
because of the reaction of  xxxg2163xxx  at a specific atp-binding site.
the presence of atp only slightly reduced radioactivity in the
fractions 10–23, which is evidence that the apparent radiolabeling observed in these fractions was probably the result of either
non-specific interactions and/or partial overflow of the
radiolabel into adjacent fractions during the rp-hplc
separation of the tryptic peptides.
3.4. stoichiometry of  xxxg2163xxx  labeling
the stoichiometry of  xxxg2163xxx  labeling under assay conditions
was examined (i.e., in the presence of 10 mm utp).  xxxg546xxx  was
inactivated with [2,8-3h] xxxg2163xxx  and the fractions were assayed
for enzyme activity, protein concentration, and incorporation of
radioactivity. the results are expressed in terms of moles of
 xxxg2163xxx  incorporated per moles of  xxxg546xxx  monomer calculated for
various stages of  xxxg546xxx  inactivation (fig. 6). interestingly, the
binding stoichiometry was approximately 4 mol of  xxxg2163xxx 
incorporated per mole of  xxxg546xxx  monomer. it appears that
multiple sites on the tetramer are available for reaction with
 xxxg2163xxx . with the exception of lys 306 (vide infra), the identity of
the reacting sites remains unknown.
3.5. isolation and sequencing of radiolabeled peptides

fig. 5. elution profiles of [2,8-3h] xxxg2163xxx -labeled  xxxg546xxx  tryptic digests. panel a
displays the elution profile for tryptic peptides derived from a digest of [2,8-3h]
 xxxg2163xxx -modified  xxxg546xxx  and separated by rp-hplc. the gradient of ch3cn is
shown as a solid line. the large peak with an elution time of 4 min represents the
void volume of the column. the corresponding radioactivity profile is shown in
panel b. elution conditions are as described in materials and methods. panel c
shows the reduction of incorporation of [2,8-3h] xxxg2163xxx  into  xxxg546xxx  in the presence
of atp.  xxxg546xxx  was incubated for 12 h with  xxxg2163xxx  (2 mm) and nacnbh3 (5 mm)
at 4 °c in both the absence (●) and presence (○) of atp (10 mm). the modified
enzyme was digested with trypsin, the peptides were separated using rp-hplc,
and the radioactivity measured for each fraction as described in materials and
methods.

the solution containing the pooled fractions of tryptic
peptides was further purified using multiple rounds of rphplc until a fraction corresponding to a single peak in the uvelution profile and displaying a high incorporation of radioactivity was obtained. this purified fraction was lyophilized and
the n-terminal amino acid sequences of the constituent peptides
determined using edman degradation. two distinct peptides
were found to be present in a 5:1 ratio. the amino acid sequences
of the isolated major and minor peptides were s(492)
gddqlveiievpnh(506) and y(298)ielpday(305), respectively (fig. 7). the minor peptide was initially thought to end
with tyr 305, however, examination of the hplc elution profile
revealed the presence of an additional phenylthiohydantoin
(pth) derivative which had an elution time similar (but not the
same as) that expected for pth-proline. since trypsin cleaves
polypeptides on the c-terminal side of lys or arg residues, the
minor peptide should have contained lys 306 as its n-terminal
amino acid residue. this atypical pth derivative probably
represents the pth derivative of lys 306 bearing the  xxxg2163xxx 
affinity label. (unfortunately, we were not able to measure the
radioactivity associated with each round of edman degradation.)
3.6. k306a and k297a kinetics
the lys 306 residue of  xxxg546xxx  that was modified by  xxxg2163xxx 
was mutated to alanine using site-directed mutagenesis. the
kinetic parameters of the wild-type and k306a ctp synthases
are given in tables 1 and 2. at saturating concentrations of utp
(2 mm), binding of atp to both wild-type and k306a ctp

fig. 6. stoichiometry of the reaction of  xxxg2163xxx  with  xxxg546xxx .  xxxg546xxx  solutions were
incubated with  xxxg2163xxx  in the presence of utp (10 mm) and, at various time
points, an aliquot of solution was removed and passed through a spin-filter
containing sephadex g-50. the filtered solution was used for determination of
enzyme activity, protein concentration and radioactivity as described in
materials and methods. complete inactivation of the enzyme corresponded to
the incorporation of 4 mol  xxxg2163xxx  per mole of  xxxg546xxx  monomer.

synthases is cooperative and the affinity of k306a  xxxg546xxx  for
atp is approximately half of that exhibited by wild-type  xxxg546xxx 
(table 1). on the other hand, at saturating concentrations of
atp (3 mm), binding of utp to both wild-type and k306a
ctp synthases shows minimal cooperativity and the affinity of
k306a  xxxg546xxx  for utp is only 1.6-fold less than that exhibited
by wild-type  xxxg546xxx . mutation of lys 306 to alanine causes a 2fold reduction in kcat with respect to atp. interestingly, a 2-fold
reduction in kcat with respect to utp was also observed.
for wild-type  xxxg546xxx , concentrations of atp and utp equal
to 1 mm are saturating. however, for k306a  xxxg546xxx , this is not

205

the case (data not shown) and hence the kinetic parameters for
nh3- and glutamine-dependent ctp formation catalyzed by
both wild-type and k306a ctp synthases were determined
under two different conditions (i.e., [atp] = [utp] = 1 mm; and
saturating values of [atp] = 3 mm, [utp] = 2 mm). the
elevated concentrations of atp and utp had little effect on
the kcat and km values for wild-type  xxxg546xxx -catalyzed nh3dependent ctp formation. however, for k306a  xxxg546xxx , there
was a 1.5-fold increase in catalytic efficiency of nh3-dependent
ctp formation at the elevated concentrations of atp and utp
resulting from a 2.3-fold increase in km and a 3.5-fold increase
in kcat (table 2). in contrast to the changes in the kinetic
parameters for nh3-dependent ctp formation, which were
small and resulted in slightly enhanced catalytic efficiency
when the concentrations of atp and utp were elevated,
reductions in the catalytic efficiency of glutamine-dependent
ctp formation were observed. for wild-type  xxxg546xxx , the value
of kcat decreased 4-fold while km was decreased 1.7-fold
leading to a 2.4-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency in the
presence of elevated concentrations of atp and utp. this
suggests the possibility that at high concentrations, binding of
the nucleoside triphosphates may be less specific giving rise to
substrate inhibition. such substrate inhibition has been observed
previously with concentrations of atp exceeding 2 mm [23].
for k306a  xxxg546xxx , the value of kcat was not significantly altered
while km was increased 2.2-fold leading to a 2-fold reduction in
catalytic efficiency with respect to glutamine.
when k306a  xxxg546xxx  was treated with  xxxg2163xxx  in the presence
of utp (10 mm), it was irreversibly inactivated in a timedependent manner (data not shown). again, this emphasizes

under optimal conditions for maximal velocity ([gtp] = 0.15 mm, [utp] = [atp] = 1 mm, and [glutamine] = 10 mm), the observed velocity was reduced 50-fold
relative to that observed with the wild-type  xxxg546xxx . this low level of activity precluded accurate determination of the kinetic constants with respect to glutamine.

that  xxxg2163xxx  is reacting at other sites in addition to lys 306. for
the inactivation of k306a by  xxxg2163xxx  in the presence of utp (10
mm), the values of ki and kinact were 3.7 ± 1.3 mm and 0.0058 ±
0.0005 min−1, respectively (data not shown). thus the apparent
affinity of k306a for  xxxg2163xxx  was not significantly different from
that observed for wild-type  xxxg546xxx , however, kinact was reduced
approximately 10-fold.
lys 297 is fully conserved in ctp synthases and appears to
interact with the beta-phosphate of gtp in modeling studies [7].
for this reason, we replaced lys 297 by alanine to assess its role
in  xxxg546xxx  catalysis. k297a exhibited essentially wild-type
interactions with atp and utp (table 1) and wild-type activity
with respect to nh3-dependent ctp formation. however,
k297a did not catalyze glutamine-dependent ctp formation.
in fact, the apparent kcat for the intrinsic  xxxg907xxx  activity of
k297a was 0.077 ± 0.007 s−1. this value is reduced 78-fold
relative to that observed for wild-type  xxxg546xxx  (6.0 s−1 [38]).
unfortunately, the extremely low velocities for conversion of
glutamine to glutamate precluded accurate measurement of km
for glutamine and the dependence of the  xxxg907xxx  activity on
gtp concentration (if any).
4. discussion
 xxxg546xxx  binds and discriminates between the four nucleotides:
utp, ctp, atp, and gtp. in addition to serving as substrates,
atp and utp act synergistically to promote tetramerization of
 xxxg546xxx  to its active form. prior to publication of two structures of
e. coli  xxxg546xxx  [7,32], we initiated a study to identify residues
that might play a role in binding atp and/or promote
tetramerization of  xxxg546xxx . to selectively label the atp-binding
site(s) of  xxxg546xxx , we sought to use an affinity label that contained
an unmodified adenine moiety so that specific recognition by
 xxxg546xxx  would be favored. 2′,3′-dialdehyde atp ( xxxg2163xxx ) [33,44]
has been used successfully to probe atp-binding sites in
numerous enzymes (e.g., see reference [45] and references
therein). this affinity label is easily prepared by the periodate
oxidation of atp [36] and is highly water-soluble, unlike other
affinity labels such as 5′-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine
[46].  xxxg2163xxx  is identical to the natural substrate except for the
ribose moiety that contains the reactive aldehyde groups. the
2′,3′-dialdehyde function reacts with the epsilon-amino group of lys

residues to form an adduct with a dihydroxymorpholino-type
structure [35,47–49], although schiff base formation is
consistent with the observations of some groups [36,50].
the present work describes the proteolytic digestion of [2,83
h] xxxg2163xxx -labeled  xxxg546xxx , separation of the tryptic peptides using
rp-hplc, and the sequencing of isolated peptides. using this
affinity labeling procedure, we identified lys 306 as the site of
covalent modification. conversion of lys 306 to alanine using
site-directed mutagenesis caused a reduction in the apparent
affinity for atp, relative to wild-type  xxxg546xxx . the k306a mutant
also exhibited reduced catalytic efficiency when glutamine was
the substrate but had wild-type efficiency when nh3 was the
substrate.
4.1. inactivation of  xxxg546xxx  by  xxxg2163xxx 
 xxxg546xxx  is inactivated in a first-order, time-dependent fashion
by  xxxg2163xxx , and the inactivation is not reversible upon dialysis.
atp provided protection against this inactivation (fig. 3b), and
the presence of atp (10 mm) during inactivation of the enzyme
with radiolabeled  xxxg2163xxx  reduced the incorporation of radioactivity in the peak fractions by approximately 60% (fig. 5c).
saturating atp (10 mm) was also able to reduce the rate of
inactivation by  xxxg2163xxx  (0.5 mm) 90-fold relative to inactivation
in the absence of utp (cf. figs. 2b and 4b).
in the presence of utp (10 mm), the inactivation kinetics
showed saturation (fig. 1b) consistent with the kinetic
mechanism shown in scheme 2. however, in the absence of
utp, the rate of inactivation of  xxxg546xxx  by  xxxg2163xxx  showed a
peculiar dependence on the concentration of  xxxg2163xxx . the value of
kobs for inactivation reached a maximum of 0.092 min−1 at
[ xxxg2163xxx ] = 0.5 mm. at higher concentrations of  xxxg2163xxx , the value
of kobs declined, ultimately “leveling off” at high  xxxg2163xxx 
concentrations with a kobs value similar to that obtained when
the inactivation was performed in the presence of 10 mm utp.
one possible explanation for such behavior is that tetramerization of the enzyme may bury a reactive lys (or possibly cys,
vide infra) residue at another site that is very reactive with
 xxxg2163xxx , yet is also protected by atp. as the concentration of
 xxxg2163xxx  is increased in the absence of utp, tetramerization of
 xxxg546xxx  occurs and reaction of  xxxg2163xxx  with the atp-binding site(s)
on the  xxxg546xxx  tetramer is less efficient than reaction with the

fig. 8. location of lys residues 297 and 306 within the structure of e. coli  xxxg546xxx . (a) the structure of e. coli  xxxg546xxx  is shown with adp, asp 303, and lys 306 in spacefilling representation (pdb code  xxxd1789xxx  [32]). residues 298–306 corresponding to the radiolabeled minor peptide identified in the present work are shaded purple.
note that the epsilon-n of lys 306 is located 3.98 å and 3.94 å from the 2′-o and 3′-o of adp, respectively. the gamma-carboxylate oxygen atoms of asp 303 are located 4.74 å
and 5.00 å from the 3′-o of adp. b. lys 297 is located at the n-terminal end of a conserved loop-helix (l10–alpha11 [7]) structure (residues 297–312, green) and the epsilon-n
of lys 297 is located 2.79 å from one of the oxygens of the beta-phosphate of gtp, and 2.68 å from the backbone carbonyl of phe 353 which resides on the l11 lid
(residues 351–356, magenta). the active site cys 379 is shown in space-filling representation.

reactive lys (or cys) residues on the  xxxg546xxx  dimer. under
conditions similar to those used for the assay of  xxxg546xxx  activity,
the stoichiometry for incorporation of  xxxg2163xxx  is 4 mol of  xxxg2163xxx 
per mole of  xxxg546xxx  monomer. this observation implies that there
may be several different sites on the  xxxg546xxx  tetramer where  xxxg2163xxx 
reacts. this conclusion is also supported by the fact that atp
did not offer total protection against inactivation in the presence
of utp (fig. 3b), and it did not completely prevent
incorporation of radioactive  xxxg2163xxx  into the protein (fig. 5c).
although  xxxg2163xxx  has been reported to react primarily with lys
residues, there are reports suggesting reaction with cys residues
to form thiohemiacetals [45,51,52]. presumably, additional
 xxxg2163xxx -labeled peptides were not isolated because of the unstable
nature of such thiohemiacetals under the rp-hplc conditions.
in contrast to the  xxxg2163xxx -dependent inactivation behavior
observed in the absence of nucleotides (fig. 2b), when atp (10
mm) is present (fig. 4b), the relationship between kobs and
 xxxg2163xxx  concentration is linear. this suggests that the presence of
10 mm atp promotes tetramerization (i.e., resulting in lower
values of kobs) and suppresses the ability of  xxxg2163xxx  to saturate the
enzyme. again, the latter observation is consistent with the
notion that  xxxg2163xxx  is reacting at the atp-binding site.
4.2. localization of the atp-binding site
prior to the recent solution of the crystal structures of  xxxg546xxx 
from thermus thermophilus [31] and from e. coli [7,32],
sequence alignments of amidotransferases suggested that the
gat domain of  xxxg546xxx  began approximately at amino acids 292
to 300 [3]. since we assumed that the atp-binding site would
be located in the synthase domain of  xxxg546xxx  (i.e., before amino
acid 300), we were surprised to isolate major and minor tryptic
peptides from regions corresponding to the apparent junction
between the gat and synthase domains and within the gat
domain, respectively. amino acid residues present in the major
tryptic peptide correspond to residues 492–506 in e. coli  xxxg546xxx .
residues within this region are relatively non-conserved
between species with the exception of glu 499 and glu 502

that are highly and fully conserved, respectively (fig. 7). in
addition, no lys residues are present in this region. since  xxxg2163xxx 
has been reported to react only with lys residues (and possibly
cys), it is unlikely that the major peptide was radiolabeled by
[2,8-3h] xxxg2163xxx .1 amino acid residues present in the minor
tryptic peptide correspond to residues 298–306 in e. coli  xxxg546xxx .
residues within this region of the primary structure of  xxxg546xxx  are
highly conserved between species, although the modified lys
306 is not fully conserved.2 the fact that k306a is inactivated
by  xxxg2163xxx  with values of kinact and kinact/ki that are both reduced
∼10-fold relative to wild-type  xxxg546xxx  supports our conclusion
that lys 306 reacts with  xxxg2163xxx . in addition, our observation that
k306a  xxxg546xxx  is still inactivated by  xxxg2163xxx  is consistent with our
suggestion that  xxxg2163xxx  is reacting at additional sites.
recently, the crystal structure of e. coli  xxxg546xxx  with bound
adp and ctp was solved at 2.8-å resolution [32]. fig. 8a
shows the residues within the structure of  xxxg546xxx  that correspond
1
it is difficult to account for the presence of the major peptide in the tryptic
digest. we are not aware of reports of  xxxg2163xxx  reacting with either ser or his
residues. the possibility that modification of his occurred leading to formation
of a positively charged species that was subsequently recognized as a trypsin
cleavage site seems unlikely when considering the unfavorable effect that the
increased steric bulk of an  xxxg2163xxx -his adduct would have on trypsin binding.
with respect to the 5:1 ratio of major to minor peptide, it should be noted that
under the radiolabeling conditions, inactivation was 100% complete. hence the
apparent low ratio does not reflect incomplete modification of lys 306 but may
arise from the possibility that the  xxxg2163xxx -lys adduct is labile even in the
presence of the reducing agent [45,47]. the labile nature of the adduct,
combined with the possibility of  xxxg2163xxx  reacting at other minor sites (e.g., other
lys and cys residues [45,51,52]), may account for the broad distribution of
low-level radioactivity detected in many of the rp- hplc fractions (see fig. 5).

photoaffinity labeling experiments conducted by olcott and mathews [56]
on e. coli  xxxg546xxx  using [gamma32p]8-n3-atp revealed that the primary site of
photoinsertion was within the sequence g(343)ldailvpggfgyr(356). in
the x-ray crystal structure of e. coli  xxxg546xxx , these residues are somewhat
removed from the atp-binding site and constitute part of the gtp-binding site
[7,32]. this result may arise from either direct binding of [gamma32p]8-n3-atp at
the gtp-binding site, conformational changes that bring these residues more
proximal to the atp-binding site, nonspecific labeling, or diffusion of the
reactive nitrene to the adjacent gtp-binding site after photolysis [57,58].

to the minor peptide identified in the present work. although the
epsilon-amino group of lys 306 does not directly interact with either
the 2′-oh or 3′-oh of adp in the structure [32], its proximity
to the 2′-oh and 3′-oh would certainly favor reaction with the
aldehyde groups of  xxxg2163xxx . thus, our identification of lys 306 as
the primary site of covalent modification by  xxxg2163xxx  is fully
consistent with the x-ray structure of the  xxxg546xxx –adp–ctp
complex.
4.3. k306a and k297a kinetics
replacement of lys 306 by alanine produced a  xxxg546xxx  variant
that exhibited a ∼2-fold reduction in its affinity for both atp and
utp. this suggests that lys 306 is not essential for atp binding
but does play a role in bringing about the conformational
changes that mediate interaction between the atp and utp sites.
the fact that lys 306 is not fully conserved between species
(fig. 7) also suggests that interaction of lys 306 with atp is not
essential (at least in ctp synthases from all species). kinetic
studies conducted by baldwin and co-workers [32] revealed that
the 2′-oh of atp is not required for substrate recognition and
catalysis since the values of [s]0.5 and vmax with respect to 2′ xxxd1148xxx  were similar to those obtained with atp. however,
interaction with the 3′-oh may be important for substrate
recognition and catalysis since 2′,3′-dideoxy-atp was not a
substrate. in the crystal structure of the  xxxg546xxx –adp–ctp
complex, asp 303 appears to interact with the 3′-oh of adp
while lys 306 does not [32]. asp 303 is not fully conserved
between species (fig. 7), but residue 303 is always an acidic
residue (asp or glu). lys 306 in e. coli  xxxg546xxx  [32] (and leu 317
in t. thermophilus  xxxg546xxx  [31]) appears to buttress asp 303 (asp
314 in t. thermophilus) orienting it for interaction with the 3′oh of adp (or atp). however, we cannot exclude the
possibility that lys 306 interacts with either the 2′-oh or 3′oh groups, especially when considering the current resolution
of the crystal structure (2.8 å), the possibility that more
substantial changes in conformation may occur upon the binding
of atp and utp to  xxxg546xxx  in solution, and our present
inactivation results with  xxxg2163xxx .
k306a  xxxg546xxx  exhibited essentially wild-type activity with
nh3 as the substrate, however, the efficiency (kcat/km) of
glutamine-dependent ctp formation was reduced approximately 2-fold. hence, the presence of the lys 306 side chain is
required to induce the appropriate changes in conformation that
promote glutamine-dependent ctp formation. indeed, previous studies have indicated that atp binding accelerates the
 xxxg907xxx  activity of e. coli  xxxg546xxx  [53]. the current crystal
structure of  xxxg546xxx  with bound adp [32] does not show
significant changes in conformation, relative to the nucleotidefree structure [7], that might account for transmission of this
allosteric signal. however, the crystal structures do suggest a
possible mechanism. lys 306 and asp 303 reside on a loophelix structure (l10–alpha11 [7]; see fig. 8b) comprised, in part,
of residues 294–306 that is present in the structures of both t.
thermophilus [31] and e. coli [7,32] ctp synthases. this
loop–helix appears to pack against the ribose moiety of atp
and interactions formed upon atp binding may be transmitted

via this loop to subtly influence the positioning of residues
such as lys 297 within the gat domain (fig. 8b). recently,
davisson and co-workers [54] reported kinetic studies on sitespecific mutants of the triad  xxxg920xxx 
imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase revealing that an
interdomain salt bridge in this enzyme plays a key role in
mediating communication between the gat and synthase
domains. the authors proposed that asp 303 may play a
similar role in signaling between the atp-binding site and the
 xxxg907xxx  site in  xxxg546xxx . our results with k306a  xxxg546xxx 
support such an allosteric signaling mechanism.
replacement of lys 297 by alanine drastically reduced the
 xxxg907xxx  activity of  xxxg546xxx  but did not affect the enzyme's
ability to catalyze nh3-dependent ctp formation. modeling
studies suggest that the epsilon-n of lys 297 interacts with the betaphosphate of gtp and forms an h-bond with the backbone
carbonyl of phe 353 on the l11 lid (residues 351–356 [7]). phe
353 is fully conserved among ctp synthases and examination of
the t. thermophilus and e. coli  xxxg546xxx  crystal structures suggests
that the phenyl ring of phe 353 packs between bound glutamine
and gtp. accompanying this hydrophobic interaction, the main
chain amide of gly 352 on the l11 lid forms part of the oxyanion
hole [7] that stabilizes the tetrahedral transition state and
intermediates formed during hydrolysis of glutamine [21].
zalkin and weng [4] showed that replacement of the adjacent
gly 351 by proline in e. coli  xxxg546xxx  abolishes glutamine
dependent ctp formation but has little effect on nh3-dependent
ctp formation. more recently, willemoës et al. [55] mutated
residues arg 359, gly 360, and glu 362 (arg 356, gly 357, and
glu 359 in e. coli) that lie close to the oxyanion hole of l. lactis
 xxxg546xxx . these residues lie on or adjacent to the l11 lid and appear
to mediate the allosteric effects of gtp on the  xxxg907xxx 
activity. thus, replacement of lys 297 by alanine may obviate
the  xxxg907xxx  activity of  xxxg546xxx  by altering the enzyme's
interaction with gtp and by altering the conformation of the l11
lid or adjacent residues. this dual effect may account for the kcat
value (0.077 s−1) for  xxxg907xxx  activity of k297a, in the
presence of gtp, being an order of magnitude less than the
corresponding kcat value (0.7 s−1, [23]) of wild-type  xxxg546xxx  in the
absence of gtp.
in conclusion, we have used  xxxg2163xxx  as an affinity label to
identify lys 306 as a residue located adjacent to the atpbinding site of e. coli  xxxg546xxx . this direct evidence for the
location of the atp-binding site in e. coli  xxxg546xxx  is consistent
with recent x-ray crystallographic findings [32]. kinetic studies
on k306a  xxxg546xxx  reveal that lys 306 plays a role in inducing the
appropriate changes in conformational that help promote
glutamine-dependent ctp formation. in addition, we show
that lys 297 is required for gtp-dependent ctp formation but
not for nh3-dependent ctp formation.
