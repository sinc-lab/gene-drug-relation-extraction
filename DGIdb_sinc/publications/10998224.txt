since the late 1970s pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine (ps; fansidartm hoffman-laroche, basel) has
been used as first line therapy for uncomplicated malaria in the amazon basin. unfortunately, resistance has developed over the last ten years in many regions of the amazon and ps is no longer recommended for use in brazil. in vitro resistance to pyrimethamine and cycloguanil (the active metabolite of
 xxxd1672xxx ) is caused by specific point mutations in plasmodium falciparum  xxxg631xxx 
(dhfr), and in vitro resistance to sulfadoxine has been associated with mutations in dihydropteroate
synthase (dhps). in association with a  xxxd1672xxx -sulfamethoxazole clinical trial in brazil, we performed a nested mutation-specific polymerase chain reaction to measure the prevalence of dhfr mutations at codons 50, 51, 59, 108 and 164 and dhps mutations at codons 436, 437, 540, 581 and 613 at
three sites in the brazilian amazon. samples from two isolated towns showed a high degree of homogeneity, with the dhfr arg-50/ile-51/asn-108 and dhps gly-437/glu-540/gly-581 mutant genotype
accounting for all infections in peixoto de azevedo (n = 15) and 60% of infections in apiacás (n = 10),
state of mato grosso. the remaining infections in apiacás differed from this predominant genotype only
by the addition of the bolivia repeat at codon 30 and the leu-164 mutation in dhfr. by contrast, 17
samples from porto velho, capital city of the state of rondônia, with much in- and out-migration,
showed a wide variety of dhfr and dhps genotypes.
key words: plasmodium falciparum - malaria -  xxxg631xxx  - dihydropteroate synthase drug resistance - brazilian amazon

malaria is one of the major public health problems in brazil, with 450,000 cases (about 77.2%
plasmodium vivax and 21.8% p. falciparum) and
approximately 10,000 deaths reported annually
(marques 1995). the amazon region, in which
migrant populations, great distances, and poor access to diagnosis and treatment are the major obstacles to malaria control, accounts for more than
95% of the cases in brazil (marques 1993, 1995).
compounding the existing problem is the emergence and spread of p. falciparum resistant to
chloroquine and pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine (ps;
fansidartm hoffman-laroche, basel), which were

the most commonly used antimalarials in brazil.
in vitro and in vivo drug response studies from the
early 1980s documented 16-63% ps failure rates
from various regions of the amazon (neifer &
kremsner 1991). after one decade with continued wide availability and use of the drug, 92% of
the samples collected from the state of acre in 1987
were found to be ps resistant.  xxxd1672xxx  was never
introduced in brazil and no current information is
available on the in vitro efficacy against brazilian
isolates of cycloguanil, the active metabolite of
 xxxd1672xxx  (kremsner et al. 1989, neifer &
kremsner 1991).
genetic analysis by polymerase chain reaction
(pcr) has demonstrated the role of mutations in
 xxxg631xxx - xxxg2366xxx 
(dhfr-ts) and dihydropteroate synthase (dhps)
genes that seem to be linked to in vitro resistance
to the following drugs: pyrimethamine, cycloguanil
and sulfadoxine (cowman et al. 1988, peterson et
al. 1988, foote et al. 1990) .

dhfr and dhps in p. falciparum from amazon  kf vasconcelos et al.

in the case of pyrimethamine and cycloguanil,
resistance is conferred by point mutations in the
parasite gene encoding dhfr, leading to amino
acid changes in the active site pocket of the enzyme. a ser at position 108 is linked to sensitivity
to both pyrimethamine and cycloguanil, a mutation to asn at position 108 confers resistance to
pyrimethamine but only a moderate loss of response to cycloguanil, and a thr at position 108
(paired with an ala to val change at position 16)
is associated with resistance to cycloguanil with
only a slight loss of response to pyrimethamine.
an asn to ile change at position 51 and a cys to
arg change at position 59 appear to modulate
higher levels of pyrimethamine resistance when
they occur with the asn-108 mutation, and an ile
to leu mutation at position 164 in combination with
the asn-108 plus arg-59 and/or ile-51 mutations
has been found in p. falciparum lines that are
highly resistant to both drugs (cowman et al. 1988,
peterson et al. 1990, foote & cowman 1994). recently, two new dhfr mutations were discovered
in an area of widespread ps resistance in bolivian
samples: cys→arg-50 and a five amino acid repeat insertion between codons 30 and 31, termed
the bolivia repeat (plowe et al. 1997). while both
are associated with in vivo ps resistance, only the
arg-50 mutation has been shown to cause pyrimethamine resistance in transfection studies in
yeast (cortese & plowe 1998).
mutations at codons 436, 437, 540, 581 and
613 of the dhps gene have been shown to cause
resistance to sulfones and sulfonamides in p.
falciparum (wang et al. 1997b, triglia et al. 1997).
mutations associated with resistance are ala-436,
gly-437, glu-540, gly-581, and phe-436 combined with thr/ser-613. the mutation gly-437 is
highly prevalent in areas of ps resistance, suggesting that this may be the first mutation in response
to drug pressure (wang et al. 1997b).
the present paper describes the use of nested
mutation-specific pcr (plowe et al. 1995, 1997),
and restriction digestion methods to measure the
prevalence of dhfr mutations at amino acids positions 50, 51, 59, 108 and 164 and dhps mutations 436, 437, 540, 581 and 613 in p. falciparum
isolates from two different gold-mining areas of
the state of mato grosso, peixoto de azevedo and
apiacás, and porto velho, capital city of rondônia.
materials and methods

study sites - at present, clinical failures of chloroquine are reaching 100% in many areas of brazil, and the drug is no longer recommended for
treatment of uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria
(andrade et al. 1992). with the advent of chloroquine resistance, other antimalarials were intro-

duced, most commonly ps. resistance to this drug
emerged rapidly and different studies have demonstrated the widespread prevalence of the dhfr
asn-108 mutation which confers moderate resistance to pyrimethamine (alecrim et al. 1982a, b,
c, peterson et al. 1991). as a result of evidence of
reduced efficacy of chloroquine and ps, the standard treatment in brazil for uncomplicated p.
falciparum malaria has become quinine-tetracycline. samples were collected from 1996 to 1998
in three malaria endemic areas in brazil. two
places of the study are the gold-mining areas,
peixoto de azevedo and apiacás, state of mato
grosso, which are localized in the southern brazilian amazon forest. these two localities had the
highest malaria transmission rates in brazil, ~300
cases/week in 1996. the samples from porto velho,
capital of the state of rondônia, were collected in
1998.
sample collection and control parasites - at
the three sites of this study we performed the same
sample collection procedure. five milliliters of
blood were collected from adult men (ages 18-65)
with uncomplicated smear-confirmed falciparum
malaria (1,000 - 100,000 ring forms/µl of blood)
at the fundação nacional de saúde (national
health foundation) posts by venipuncture using
vacutainers with edta (beckton and dickinson,
nj).
the samples were centrifuged and the pellet
containing packed blood cells was mixed with
equal volume of cryopreservation solution (nacl
0.9%, sorbitol 4.2%, glycerol 28%) frozen and
transported in liquid nitrogen containers to rio de
janeiro. nine samples from peixoto de azevedo
and apiacás were successfully grown in vitro by
the modified method of trager and jensen (1997)
and used for the in vitro drug test analysis. the
w2 and hb3, ps resistant clones and d6, ps sensitive clone were used as controls (de pecoulas et
al. 1996).
dna extraction - one ml of blood was centrifuged and suspended in net buffer (150mm
nacl, 10mm edta, 50mm tris, ph 7.5) and
treated with 1% sarcosyl and proteinase k (20 mg/
ml, 2 h at 50oc). dna was then extracted using
phenol, phenol/chloroform and chloroform, precipitated with sodium acetate (0.3m) and ethanol,
and resuspended in distilled water.
nested mutation-specific pcr - pcr was done
as previously described for analysis of the dhfr
mutation sites (plowe et al. 1995, 1997) (fig. 1).
the dhfr domain obtained from the first pcr
amplification round, which used the oligonucleotide primer pair amp1/amp2, was used as a template in mutation-specific second amplification to
assess all the dhfr mutation sites.

for codon 50, mutation-specific sense primers
fr50w, which contains the codon for the wild type
cys and fr50m, which contains the mutant codon
for arg, were paired with the antisense primer sp2
for a pcr product of 570 bp. the mutation-specific sense primers fr51w, which specifically
amplifies sequence containing the wild type aat
(asn) codon, and fr51m, which is specific for the
mutant codon att (ile), were paired with the common antisense primer sp2, for a final product of
574 bp. the codon 59 was analyzed with the
antisense primers fr59w, specific for the wild type
cys and fr59m specific for mutant codon arg,
were paired with the common sense primer sp1
with a product size of 190 bp. detection of the
dhfr bolivia repeat was done by size determination of the amplified pcr product corresponding
to the dhfr domain 5' to codon 59. for the analysis of the dhfr codon 108 the common sense sp1
were paired dia-3 for the wild-type codon ser,
dia-12 for the mutant codon asn and dia-9 for
the mutant codon thr. the final pcr product was
337 bp. for codon 164 the sp1 primer was paired
with the antisense primers fr164w specific for the
wild-type codon ile and fr164m and gave a final
product of 505 bp.
detection for the known dhps mutations at
the codons 436, 437, 540, 581 and 613 was done
as described (wang et al. 1997a, b) (fig. 2). five
microliters of the genomic p. falciparum dna
was amplified in a 50 ml reaction using mutation-

specific pcr and restriction digestion methods
(wang et al. 1995, plowe et al. 1997).
determination of the antimalarial activity of
antifolates - the drugs used in this study were obtained from the division of experimental therapeutics, the walter reed army institute of research, washington, d.c. methods for the quantitative assessment of anti-malarial drugs on a
semiautomated microdilution technique were described previously (milhous et al. 1985). determinations of the ic50 (inhibitory concentration at
50%) were made for sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine,
cycloguanil and  xxxd1672xxx  in a folate-free and
paba-free rpmi-1640 medium (gibco brl,
grand island, ny) with 32 mm nahco 3
(gibco), 25 mm hepes (gibco), dialyzed
human plasma and a+ erythrocytes.
parasites were set up on the above deficient
medium at initial 0.5% parasitemia, 2.5%
haematocrit, 225 µl final volume, in 96-well
microtiter plates. for each drug, two columns of
seven wells was reserved. in the first seven rows
(rows a-g) the drugs were added in a descending
order of 3x concentration. the drug concentration
range used to establish ic50 values was 0-12 µg/
ml for all the drugs. in the 8th row, the first six
wells had only parasites with any drug (maximum
radioactive uptake) and the last six wells had
uninfected erythrocytes as controls for background
incorporation of radioactive label. the microtiter
plate was placed in a box, gassed with 5% co2,

with the drugs at 37oc, 0.5 µci [3h]hypoxanthine

a further 16 h. after harvesting the well contents,
the filters were counted in a scintillation counter
(wallac) and the incorporation data were analyzed
by non-linear regression software -nfit (university of texas, medical branch, galveston) in order to generate ic50. ic50 values were defined as
the concentration of antifolate drugs at which parasite growth was reduced to half that of the untreated
controls, as measured by tritium incorporation.
results

dhfr genotypes - seventeen samples from
peixoto de azevedo, ten from apiacás and fifteen
from porto velho were analyzed by pcr and restriction digestion. all fragments size corresponded
to those described previously (plowe et al. 1995,
1997, wang et al. 1997b). dhfr genotypes are
shown in table i and dhps genotypes in table ii.
all samples collected in peixoto showed only one
genotype, with the following dhfr mutations: arg50, ile-51, cys-59, asn-108 and ile-164. samples
from apiacás, however, showed two distinct genotypes: six out of ten showed the same allelic variation observed in peixoto, but four out of ten were
found to have the genotype cys-50, ile-51, cys-59,

asn-108 and leu-164 associated with high levels
of resistance to both pyrimethamine and cycloguanil.
these four samples were also found to contain the
bolivia repeat (br) (plowe et al. 1997).
the thr-108 dhfr mutation, which confers
resistance to cycloguanil, was not found in peixoto
or in apiacás, but was detected in eleven porto
velho samples as a mixed population with the
mutation asn-108. the samples collected in porto
velho showed considerably more allelic variation
and fewer mutations than those from peixoto and
apiacás. two samples from porto velho were
mutated only at codon 108 with both thr and asn
mutations in the same samples. five porto velho
samples had wild type cys at codon 50 and seven
had wild type asn at codon 51, whereas all peixoto
and apiacás samples were mutated at these codons.
dhps genotypes - all samples from peixoto
and apiacás had the wild-type ser-436 and ala613 but sulfadoxine resistance-associated mutations gly-437, glu-540 and gly-581 (table ii).
seven out of fifteen samples analyzed in porto
velho had the ala-436 dhps mutation.
in vitro drug test - four samples from peixoto
and five from apiacás were cultured and after two
weeks in vitro tested against pyrimethamine,
cycloguanil,  xxxd1672xxx  and sulfadoxine (table iii).
all the samples were found to be resistant to pyr

and sulfadoxine and showed to have reduced susceptibility to cycloguanil and  xxxd1672xxx  when compared with the susceptible strain d6 (sierra leone).
the inhibitory concentrations (ic50 ) values to
pyrimethamine range from 48 to 98 ng/ml in the
peixoto and 50.8 to 87.4 ng/ml in apiacás. for
cycloguanil, the ic50 levels varied from 2.9 to 4.75
and 1.42 to 2.42 ng/ml in peixoto and apiacás,
respectively. in apiacás and peixoto the ic50 for
 xxxd1672xxx  range from 331 to 1,125 ng/ml and 320
to 1,657 ng/ml, respectively.
although  xxxd1672xxx  is not the active metabolite, this drug showed an antimalarial activity in a
nanomolar range, suggesting an independent
mechanism of parasite inhibition by the  xxxd1672xxx .
for sulfadoxine, the levels varied from 1,357 to
6,987 ng/ml in the peixoto samples and from 1,043
to 1,686 ng/ml in apiacás. in comparison to the
sensitive strain d6, the brazilian parasites were in
average 700 fold more resistant to pyrimethamine,
ten fold to cycloguanil, four fold to  xxxd1672xxx  and
eight fold more resistant to sulfadoxine.

discussion

in 1972, resistance to ps was first reported in
brazil shortly thereafter in colombia. in brazil, in
vitro and in vivo drug studies from the early 80s
documented 16-63% ps failure rates in various
regions of the amazon (alecrim et al. 1982a, b,
c). after one decade of wide availability and use
of the drug, 92% of samples collected from the
state of acre in 1987 were found to be ps resistant (neifer et al. 1991). today this drug combination is not recommended for use in any region of
brazil.
this study describes antifolate resistance mutations in three different communities of the brazilian amazon. in the two gold-mining areas
peixoto and apiacás, only two distinct genotypes
associated with pyrimethamine resistance were
found, one with the dhfr mutations ile-51 and
asn-108 and the second dhfr mutations at cys59, asn-108 and leu-164 associated with high
level resistance to pyrimethamine and cycloguanil.
the samples from porto velho were less highly

mutated with more allelic variation than those from
peixoto and apiacás. in porto velho, samples originated from several different river communities. in
this region, there is intense internal migration from
different parts of the amazon as well as in- and
out-migration from bolivia and peru. the higher
degree of host mobility may explain the increased
allelic variation in this area.
interestingly, we found the relatively rare thr108 dhfr mutation in four samples from porto
velho. these samples were analyzed three times
to confirm the presence of this mutation. dna sequencing studies are planned to verify these results and to rule out the presence of novel dhfr
mutations.
in this study were found 40% of the analyzed
samples from apiacás the mutation leu in position 164 of the falciparum dhfr, which is associated with in vivo and in vitro cycloguanil resistance. although  xxxd1672xxx  has never been reported
as being used for the treatment of malaria in brazil, the appearance of this mutation could be explained by the introduction in brazil of a parasite
population containing this mutation or by the previous pyrimethamine selection when the drug was
used.
in addition, the bolivia repeat previously reported by plowe et al. (1997) was always in combination with this point mutation. this repeat which
is localized in 5’domain of the dhfr, was previously found in all bolivian samples with the mutant leu-164. antifolate resistance due to dhfr
mutations expressed in yeast was not increased with
the bolivia repeat in addition to the leu-164. despite the bolivian policy to stop the use of pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine, approximately 500,000
tables were consumed in 1995 (kublin et al. 1998)
in the country. with high in migration from bolivia to brazil, the bolivia repeat in combination
with the arg-50 and leu-164 was probably recently
introduced by bolivian migrants specifically in the
apiacás region and not in peixoto. apiacás is localized 200 km from peixoto and has the same
gold-miners migration pattern. this is the first evidence of these mutations in brazil and we could
trace this parasites studying other samples from
different malaria endemic areas of brazil.
the most common dhps genotype at the study
sites contained the mutations gly-437, glu-540 and
gly-581, which has also been observed in areas of
high ps resistance in peru and bolivia (kublin et
al. 1998). the dhps ala-436, which was not found
in peru and bolivia, was present only in porto
velho, where overall mutation rates were lower.
this is consistent with the observation that ala436, while associated with sulfa resistance in vitro,
is inversely associated with in vivo ps resistance

mem inst oswaldo cruz, rio de janeiro, vol. 95(5), sep./oct. 2000

(kublin et al. 1998).the gly-437, which is present
in sulfa-resistant strains from different parts of the
world, appears to be the first selected mutation in
dhps enzyme from resistant parasites.
the indiscriminate and unsupervised use of
sulfonamides for bacterial infections in areas where
malaria is prevalent is common in brazil (cor jésus
fontes, pers. commun.) and despite the brazilian
policy to control the general use of sulfa drugs,
they are widely available commercially in brazil.
given that the role of dhps mutations in clinical
failure of ps remains controversial (kublin et al.
1998), the use of sulfa drugs for bacterial infections must be considered as a possible explanation
of the high prevalence of dhps mutations at the
study sites.
the dhfr and dhps mutation patterns found
in this study suggest that reintroduction of ps to
these areas of brazil cannot be recommended,
based on a high prevalence of in vivo resistance in
peruvian samples containing similar mutation patterns. our findings also have implications for the
choice of other new antimalarial combinations for
use in brazil. for example, combinations of
shorter-acting antifolates such as chlorproguanil/
dapsone (kublin et al. 1998) or  xxxd1672xxx /
sulfamethoxazole have been considered as a strategy for deterring the emergence of antifolate-resistant parasites. unfortunately, the presence of
mutations such as dhfr leu-164 that have been
associated with resistance to these dhfr inhibitors may predict that these drugs would not perform well in the areas surveyed in this study. additional studies of the relationship between dhfr
and dhps genotypes and therapeutic outcomes for
these antifolate combinations are needed to validate the use of molecular assays for antifolate resistance as a basis for setting antimalarial drug treatment policy in different settings.
