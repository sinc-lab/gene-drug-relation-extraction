expression of receptors for luteinizing hormone-releasing
hormone in human ovarian and endometrial cancers: frequency,
autoregulation, and correlation with direct antiproliferative
activity of  xxxd2226xxx  analogues

and günter emons, mda göttingen and marburg, germany
objective: several recent reports have demonstrated the expression of  xxxd2226xxx 
receptors by human ovarian and endometrial cancers. controversy persists on the relevance of this finding, in particular whether these receptors mediate direct antiproliferative effects of  xxxd2226xxx 
analogues. we correlated the expression of  xxxd2226xxx  receptors by well-characterized
ovarian and endometrial cancer cell lines with the ability of  xxxd2226xxx  analogues to reduce their proliferation and studied the autoregulation of  xxxg1325xxx  expression by  xxxd2226xxx  agonist  xxxd3445xxx  and antagonist  xxxd466xxx . the expression of
 xxxd2226xxx  receptors was assessed in a series of specimens from primary ovarian and
endometrial cancers.
study design:  xxxg1325xxx  expression was assessed by semiquantitative
reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction and radioligand binding assay. antiproliferative effects were ascertained by proliferation assays in the absence or presence of  xxxd2226xxx  analogues.
results: ovarian (4/6 cell lines) and endometrial (5/6 cell lines) cancer cell lines expressed luteinizing
hormone-releasing hormone receptors. the proliferation of these  xxxg1325xxx –positive cell lines was dose- and time-dependently reduced by agonistic and antagonistic luteinizing
hormone-releasing hormone analogues.  xxxg1325xxx  density was reduced to
80% of controls (control, 100 %; p < .001) by  xxxd2226xxx  analogues. seventy percent of
primary ovarian cancers and 83% of primary endometrial cancers expressed  xxxd2226xxx  receptors.
conclusion: these findings suggest that  xxxd2226xxx  receptors that are expressed
by human ovarian and endometrial cancer cell lines mediate direct antiproliferative effects of luteinizing
hormone-releasing hormone analogues. because most respective primary cancers expressed luteinizing
hormone-releasing hormone receptors, these receptors might be used for novel antiproliferative therapeutic approaches and should be further evaluated. (am j obstet gynecol 2002;186:171-9.)

 xxxd2226xxx  ( xxxg930xxx ),
also called  xxxg930xxx , functions
as a key hormone in the regulation of the pituitary-gonadal axis. in addition, it probably also affects various
extrapituitary tissues. in a series of recent studies, it could
be demonstrated that ovarian and endometrial cancer
cell lines and the respective primary tumors express
 xxxg930xxx  immunoactivity and bioactivity and the messenger
rna for  xxxg930xxx .1,2 in addition, specific high-affinity binding sites for  xxxg930xxx  and the expression of the transcript
for the pituitary  xxxg930xxx  receptor have been detected in
ovarian and endometrial cancer cell lines and in approximately 80% of biopsy specimens of these cancers.2-6
the proliferation of several human ovarian and endometrial cancer cell lines, which express  xxxg930xxx  receptors, was reduced by agonistic and antagonistic analogues
of  xxxg930xxx .2,7,8 it has been suggested that these antiproliferative effects, which are evident at nanomolar concentrations of  xxxg930xxx  analogues, are mediated through
 xxxg930xxx  receptors.2,8 in contrast, other groups failed to detect  xxxg930xxx  receptors or antiproliferative activity of
 xxxg930xxx  analogues in human ovarian and endometrial
cancer cell lines, or they observed antiproliferative effects
at extremely high concentrations of  xxxg930xxx  analogues.9-11
the present study was performed to assess the expression of  xxxg930xxx  receptors in a panel of well-characterized
human ovarian and endometrial cancer cell lines and to
correlate it to possible antiproliferative activity of  xxxg930xxx 
analogues. in addition, to further corroborate the biologic significance of  xxxg930xxx  receptors in these cancers, we
studied whether their expression is regulated by  xxxg930xxx 
agonists and antagonists. finally, we checked a series of
primary ovarian (n = 20 cancers) and endometrial cancers (n = 6 cancers) for the expression of both  xxxg930xxx  receptor mrna and high-affinity binding sites to evaluate
the possible relevance of the cell line experiments for the
in vivo situation.
material and methods
cell lines and culture conditions. the human ovarian
and endometrial cancer cell lines that were used
(efo-21, efo-27, nih: ovcar-3, bg-1, sk-ov-3, sw 626,
ishikawa, hec-1a, hec-1b, kle, an-3-ca, mfe-296)
were obtained from american type culture collection
(atcc, manassas, va) or the sources detailed previously.2
the cells were cultured at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide in air, as previously described.2 biopsy samples were collected (g.e.) and frozen
in liquid nitrogen immediately after removal in the operation theater. histologic classification of ovarian epithelial cancers was performed according to the world
health organization system.12 endometrial carcinoma
was classified according to the system proposed by the international society of gynecologic pathologists.13 surgical/pathologic staging and grading were performed

according to the respective international federation of
gynecology and obstetrics (figo) systems.12,13
the medium used was based on earle’s salts and contained 2-fold concentrations of earle’s minimal essential medium, vitamins and essential and nonessential
amino acids (biochrom, berlin, germany). other components were 2.2 g nahco3 per liter (biochrom), 2.5
mg transferrin per liter (sigma, deisenhofen, germany), and 67 mg  xxxd2193xxx  sulfate per liter
(biochrom). the medium was supplemented with 40
international units of insulin per liter (hoechst, frankfurt, germany) and 10% fetal calf serum (boehringer,
mannheim, germany).2
 xxxg930xxx  analogues. the  xxxg930xxx  agonist [d-trp6] xxxg930xxx 
( xxxd3445xxx ) was provided by ferring arzneimittel, kiel,
germany; the  xxxg930xxx  antagonistic analogue  xxxd466xxx 
was a gift from asta medica, frankfurt, germany.
 xxxg930xxx  radioligand assay. the existence of high-affinity
binding sites for [d-trp6] xxxg930xxx  was measured as previously described,2 always with the use of membrane preparations of different cell lines and tumor biopsy specimens.
in experiments in which cells were pretreated with  xxxg930xxx 
analogues, we used a 3-step wash procedure, following the
methods of szöke et al,14 to remove  xxxg930xxx  analogues from
the receptors. cells were detached from the culture flask
and collected by centrifugation.2 then they were rapidly
washed with 2  10 ml ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline
solution (pbs) and treated for 10 minutes with 5 ml of
chilled acetic acid (0.2 mol/l), nacl (0.5 mol/l; ph 2.5)
at 4°c. centrifugation at 200g separated the cells from the
acid wash solution before the cells were washed with 5 ml
of ice-cold pbs. in pilot experiments, it was shown that this
procedure effectively removed  xxxg930xxx  analogues from the
receptors without altering their binding characteristics
and number. to correct the data yielded from receptor assays with membrane preparations for cell number, the concentrations of binding sites, calculated by the ligand
program (provided by drs p.j. munson and d. rodbard;
laboratory of theoretical and physical biology, nichd,
nih, bethesda, md) in the dimension of moles per liter,
were transformed into moles per 106 cells.
isolation of rna. total rna was prepared from cells
grown in monolayer or from primary tumors with the use
of the rneasy protocol (qiagen, hilden, germany). the
concentration of rna in each sample was determined by
photospectroscopy.
reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (rtpcr) amplification. first strand complementary dna was
obtained from 4 µg of total rna with the use of p(dt)15
primers (boehringer mannheim, mannheim, germany)
with moloney murine leukemia virus–rt, according to
the instructions of the manufacturer (gibco, eggenstein, germany). the cdnas were amplified in a 50 µl
reaction volume that contained 10 mmol/l tris-hcl (ph
8.3), 50 mmol/l  xxxd2988xxx , 1.5 mmol/l mag-

nesium chloride, 200 µmol/l each of the deoxynucleoside triphosphates, and 1 µmol/l of the appropriate
primers in a thermal cycler (thermo cycler 2400; perkin
elmer, norwalk, conn). the primers used were sense
5´agt cca atg gta tgc tgg aga3´ (base pairs
367-387) and antisense 5´acc cgt gts agg  xxxg889xxx  aa3´
(base pairs 777-761), according to the sequence published for the human  xxxg930xxx  receptor.4 we performed 35
cycles of amplification: denaturation at 94°c for 1
minute, annealing 60°c for 1 minute followed by extension at 72°c for 1 minute. the respective dna products
were run on 1% agarose gels, and bands were visualized
by ethidium bromide staining on a uv transilluminator.
internal standard synthesis. for semiquantitative
rt-pcr of  xxxg930xxx  receptor, a 187–base pair internal standard was generated by pcr in 3 steps. in the first pcr
step, we used primers that were specific for a synthetic
dna template (institute for molecular biology and
tumor research, marburg, germany), amplifying a
166–base pair dna fragment of the synthetic dna template. in the second pcr step, hybrid primers were used.
the first hybrid primer (hybrid forward primer: 5´ agt
cca atg gta tgc tgg aga cgc aag tga aat ctc
ctc c 3´) consisted of nucleotides 1 through 21 of the
 xxxg930xxx  receptor cdna sequence and a primer sequence
that is specific for the synthetic dna in position 21
through 40. the second hybrid primer (hybrid backward
primer: 5´ acc cgt gtc agg  xxxg889xxx  aag atg att ttt
gca ttg cag atc a 3´) consisted of the second primer
sequence specific for the synthetic dna in position 18
through 40. nucleotides 1 through 17 are identical to the
 xxxg930xxx  receptor cdna sequence from position 761
through 777 in reverse orientation. with these hybrid
primers, together with the 166–base pair product from
the first pcr step, the second pcr product has a total
length of 187 base pair, which contain synthetic dna and
 xxxg930xxx  receptor–specific primer sites. this secondary
pcr product was then amplified in a third pcr step with
the  xxxg930xxx  receptor primers only (forward primer: 5´
agt cca atg gta tgc tgg aga 3´; backward
primer: 5´ acc cgt gtc agg  xxxg889xxx  aa 3´), which resulted in an internal standard for  xxxg930xxx  receptor quantification of 187 base pair.
semiquantitative pcr amplification. the cdnas (2 ng)
were amplified in a 50-µl reaction volume that contained
10 mmol/l tris-hcl (ph 8.3), 50 mmol/l potassium
chloride, 1.5 mmol/l  xxxd2532xxx , 200 µmol/l
of each of the dntps including 32p-atp (3000 ci/mmol;
amersham-buchler, braunschweig, germany), 1 µmol/l
of the appropriate primers, and 1.25 unit taq polymerase
(boehringer mannheim) in a dna thermal cycler (dna
thermal cycler 2400; perkin elmer, weiterstadt, germany). we performed 35 cycles of amplification: denaturation at 94°c for 30 seconds, annealing at 60°c for 30
seconds, followed by extension at 72°c for 60 seconds.

völker et al 173

the pcr product amplified with the  xxxg930xxx  receptor
primers has a total length of 417 base pair. for testing of
the optimal concentration of the internal standard that is
used in semiquantitative pcr, internal standard and target cdna were added to the pcr tubes in inverse serial
dilutions. pcr products were separated by gel electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose. pcr reactions that yielded
standard and target signals of identical intensity were
used for pcr analysis for determination of  xxxg930xxx  receptor expression levels. the respective dna products were
run on 1.5% agarose gels, and bands were visualized by
ethidium bromide staining on a uv transilluminator. for
quantification, the bands were cut from the gel, and radioactivity was determined as counts per minute with a
beta-liquid scintillation counter (ls 1801; beckman,
münchen, germany). to correct for cell number, we isolated total rna from 106 cells and used 4 µg to synthesize
cdna. expression levels of  xxxg930xxx  receptor mrna were
calculated in comparison with the basal  xxxg930xxx  receptor
mrna expression levels in the percentage of daily control.
restriction enzyme analysis. pcr products were digested with the restriction endonucleases bamhi and
psti, with the conditions recommended by the manufacturer (boehringer). the digested products, along with
untreated aliquots of each pcr sample, were then fractionated on 1% agarose gel and stained.
southern blot and hybridization. pcr products were
separated on 1% agarose gels, were visualized as described, and then were transferred to hybond-n+ membranes (amersham-buchler). the blots were hybridized
with an established cdna for human pituitary  xxxg930xxx  receptor (base pairs 1-1560) with the ecl-direct nucleic
acid labeling and detection system (rpn 3000; amersham-buchler), according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
proliferation assays. the time course and doseresponse proliferation experiments were performed as
described in detail previously.2 briefly, 20,000 cells of
each cell line were plated in multiple 4-well cluster dishes
(nunc, roskilde, denmark) and allowed to attach to the
wells. after 24 hours, the medium was changed and 20 µl
of pbs-bovine  xxxg124xxx  or appropriate dilutions of
 xxxd3445xxx  or  xxxd466xxx  were added, which resulted in
final concentrations of 10 pmol/l to 10 µmol/l. after 5
days, viable cells, which were determined by trypan-blue
exclusion, were counted in a neubauer hemocytometer.
statistical analysis. all experiments were reproduced 3
times in different passages of the respective cell lines or
the collected cancer biopsy specimens. data were tested
for significant differences with the mann-whitney u test.
the data from the dose-response experiments were
tested for significant differences by 1-way analysis of variance followed by the student-newman-keuls’ test for
comparison of individual groups, after a bartlett test had

sw-626 and the endometrial cancer cell line mfe-296, no
binding sites for  xxxd3445xxx  were detectable. with the use
of the radioligand assay, high-affinity binding for 125i-labeled [d-trp6] xxxg930xxx  was found in 14 of 20 ovarian cancers (70%; table ii) and in 5 of 6 endometrial cancer
samples (83%; table iii).
expression of  xxxg930xxx  receptor mrna. pcr amplification of cdna from the efo-21, efo-27, nih: ovcar-3,

14 of 20 human ovarian cancer biopsy samples and 5 of 6
endometrial cancer biopsy samples with the oligonucleotide primers for human  xxxg930xxx  receptor yielded the
expected 417-base pair product (fig 1; tables i-iii).
cleavage of the 417-base pair product with restriction enzymes yielded the expected fragments of 297 base pairs
and 114 base pairs (pst i) and 232 base pairs and 179 base
pairs (bam hi; data not shown). the sequence of the
pcr products was further confirmed by southern blotting and subsequent hybridization with the established
cdna for the human pituitary  xxxg930xxx  receptor7 (data not
shown). in the ovarian cancer cell lines sk-ov-3 and sw
626, the expression of the mrna for the human pituitary
 xxxg930xxx  receptor could not be demonstrated.

efo-21, efo-27, nih: ovcar-3 (fig 2), and bg-1 ovarian
cancer cell lines and ishikawa, hec-1a, hec-1b, kle, and

was dose dependently inhibited by 5 days of treatment with
different concentrations (10 pmol/l, 1 nmol/l, 100
nmol/l, 10 µmol/l) of the  xxxg930xxx  agonist  xxxd3445xxx . in
the  xxxg930xxx  receptor negative cell lines sk-ov-3 (fig 2), sw

the reduction in cell number was significant in all cell lines
(71%-87% of control; p < .01).  xxxd3445xxx  at 100 nmol/l
had still greater antiproliferative effects (62%-75% of control; p < .01), and the inhibitory effects were maximal  xxxd1891xxx

 xxxg930xxx  antagonist  xxxd466xxx  for the cell lines efo-21, bg-1,
ishikawa, hec-1a, hec-1b, and kle; the reduction of cell
number corresponded to that obtained with the agonist
 xxxd3445xxx . in cell line efo-27, we did not observe an antiproliferative effect of the  xxxg930xxx  antagonist  xxxd466xxx .
in the presence of 10 µmol/l  xxxd3445xxx , the number
of the ovarian cancer cells and the endometrial cancer
cells that expressed  xxxg930xxx  receptors was significantly reduced after 5 days compared with control (100%):
efo-21, 58.4% ± 2.5% (p < .001); efo-27, 69.7% ± 1.3%
(p < .001); nih: ovcar-3, 71.6% ± 3.8% (p < .001); bg-1,
70.75% ± 1.5% (p < .001); ishikawa, 63.0% ± 1.8% (p <
.001); hec-1a, 56.8% ± 1.4% (p < .001); hec-1b, 56.5%
± 1.2% (p < .001); kle, 67.1% ± 3.1% (p < .001); and
an-3-ca, 62.0% ± 2.4% (p < .001). this antiproliferative
effect increased gradually with time (data not shown). in
the cell lines sk-ov-3, sw 626, and mfe-296,  xxxd3445xxx 
had no antiproliferative effects (table i). when the antiproliferative activity of the  xxxg930xxx  antagonist  xxxd466xxx 
was studied in the cell lines efo-21, bg-1, ishikawa,
hec-1a, hec-1b, and kle, comparable results were obtained: efo-21, 66.1% ± 3.6% (p < .001); ishikawa,
69.7% ± 2.2% (p < .001); and hec-1a, 70.1% ± 2.5% (p
< .001). similar results were obtained with bg-1, hec-1b,
and kle cell lines. proliferation of ovarian cancer cell
line efo-27 was not inhibited by  xxxd466xxx  (93.7% ±
2.0% [ns]; table i).
regulation of the  xxxg930xxx  receptor mrna expression by
 xxxg930xxx  analogues. after 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours of treatment with and without  xxxd3445xxx  (10 µmol/l) in the absence of fetal calf serum and phenol red, the expression
of  xxxg930xxx  receptor mrna was determined with semiquantitative rt-pcr (data for efo-21 shown in fig 1),
with the use of the mimic oligonucleotides as internal
standard and the primers for the human pituitary

 xxxg930xxx -receptor. after 96 hours of treatment, a significant
reduction of  xxxg930xxx  receptor mrna expression was observed in the ovarian cancer cell lines efo-21 and
efo-27 and in the endometrial cancer cell lines ishikawa
and hec-1a.  xxxd3445xxx  reduced the mrna expression
to 62.9% ± 6.4% in efo-21, to 60.8% ± 5.8% in efo-27,
to 63.7% ± 7.0% in ishikawa, and to 62.5% ± 6.7% in
hec-1a of respective controls (100%; fig 3). the reduction of  xxxg930xxx -receptor mrna expression increased
gradually with time (fig 3). comparable results were obtained after treatment with the  xxxg930xxx  antagonist  xxxd466xxx  (10 µmol/l). fig 4 shows data after treatment with
 xxxd466xxx  for 24 to 96 hours in percentages of respective
controls (100 %): 68.4% ± 7.3% in efo-21, 69.8% ± 6.4%
in efo-27, 67.6% ± 5.8% in ishikawa, and 70.1% ± 8.4%
in hec-1a.
regulation of the high-affinity/low-capacity  xxxg930xxx 
binding sites by  xxxg930xxx  analogues. after 96 hours of treatment with  xxxd3445xxx  (10 µmol/l), the expression of the
high-affinity/low-capacity binding site for  xxxg930xxx  analogues was reduced, as compared with respective controls
(100%), to 82% in efo-21, to 85% in efo-27, to 82% in
ishikawa, and to 79% in hec-1a cell lines (table iv).
comparable results were obtained from treatment with
 xxxd466xxx  (10 µmol/l): 85% in efo-21, 79% in efo-27,
84% in ishikawa, and 87% in hec-1a.
comment
our data demonstrate that most of a panel of ovarian
and endometrial cancer cell lines express the mrna for
the human pituitary  xxxg930xxx  receptor and high-affinity
binding sites for  xxxg930xxx . the proliferation of these
 xxxg930xxx  receptor positive cell lines efo-21, efo-27, nih:

logues in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. ovarian
cancer cell lines sk-ov-3 and sw 626 did not express
high-affinity  xxxg930xxx  binding sites, and the respective
mrna and their proliferation were not influenced by
 xxxg930xxx  analogues. in endometrial cancer cell line
mfe-296, no high-affinity  xxxg930xxx  binding site could be
detected, although the mrna for the pituitary  xxxg930xxx  receptor was expressed. the proliferation of mfe-296 was
not affected by  xxxg930xxx  analogues. these findings suggest
that the expression of a high-affinity  xxxg930xxx  binding site
is associated with the ability of  xxxg930xxx  analogues to reduce the proliferation of ovarian and endometrial cancer
cell lines.
yano et al8 found direct antiproliferative effects of
 xxxg930xxx  analogues in ovarian cancer cell line ov-1063,
which expressed a functional  xxxg930xxx  receptor. kimura et
al15 described the expression of mrna for  xxxg930xxx  receptor in a human ovarian cancer cell line (caov-3), the proliferation of which was significantly reduced in the
presence of 1 mmol/l  xxxg930xxx  analogue. in addition, earlier findings on direct antitumor effects of  xxxg930xxx  analogues in ovarian and endometrial cancers reported by
others7,16 and ourselves2 are completely in agreement
with the results described here.
other groups2,9 failed to detect direct antitumor effects of  xxxg930xxx  analogues in human ovarian and endometrial cancer cell lines or observed them only at
extremely high  xxxg930xxx  analogue concentrations. in contrast to imai et al,5 who found the expression of both
 xxxg930xxx  receptor mrna and  xxxg930xxx  receptors and biologic effects of  xxxg930xxx  analogues in the human ovarian
cancer cell line sk-ov-3, this cell line did not express
 xxxg930xxx  mrna and high-affinity binding sites in our
hands. furthermore, the proliferation of this ovarian
cancer cell line was not influenced by  xxxg930xxx  analogue
treatment. chatzaki et al10 and borri et al11 detected
 xxxg930xxx  receptor mrna in human endometrial cancer
cell lines but could not confirm the antiproliferative effects of  xxxg930xxx  analogues. in contrast with our group,
they did not find  xxxg930xxx  receptor mrna in the human
endometrial cancer cell line hec-1a. these discrepancies might be explained by the fact that different subclones of the cell lines may have been used by different
authors. alternatively, differences in culture or experimental conditions and in the types of  xxxg930xxx  analogues
used might be responsible for the observed variances.
our findings, however, clearly show that the proliferation of cell lines that express  xxxg930xxx  receptors is reduced
by  xxxg930xxx  agonists and, except for the efo-27 cell line,
also by  xxxg930xxx  antagonists. this conclusion is further
strengthened by the observation made in endometrial
cancer cell line mfe-296. these cells express the transcript for the pituitary  xxxg930xxx  receptor but no highaffinity  xxxg930xxx  binding site. treatment with  xxxg930xxx 
analogues had no effect on the proliferation of this cell

line. this finding, in addition, underlines the importance not only of the assessment of the presence of highaffinity binding sites but also the expression of  xxxg930xxx 
receptor transcripts.
it might be reasonable to speculate that the highaffinity binding site mediates the antiproliferative effects
of  xxxg930xxx  analogues. in our studies, the dose-response relationship of the antiproliferative effects of  xxxd3445xxx 
and  xxxd466xxx  was evaluated. the data obtained show
that, at 1-nmol/l concentrations of either analogue, a
significant reduction of cell number occurred in  xxxg930xxx 
receptor positive cancer cell lines. with higher concentrations of  xxxd3445xxx  or  xxxd466xxx  (100 nmol/l and 10
µmol/l), there was a gradual increase in the antiproliferative effects. in our experiments with respective cancer
cell lines, we found that the antagonist  xxxd466xxx  inhibited growth virtually to the same extent as the  xxxg930xxx  agonist  xxxd3445xxx , except for the cell line efo-27 as
observed earlier.2
the data reported in this article provide clear evidence
that  xxxg930xxx  analogues can directly slow down the proliferation of human ovarian and endometrial cancer cells.
gründker et al17 found no increase in apoptosis in ovarian or endometrial (unpublished results) cancer cells
that were treated with  xxxd3445xxx . moreover, they demonstrated that  xxxg930xxx  agonist  xxxd3445xxx  reduced apoptosis
that was induced by the cytotoxic agent doxorubicin. this
assumption is supported by the findings of thompson et
al,7 who showed that treatment of a human ovarian cancer cell line with the  xxxg930xxx  agonist leuprolide caused a
reversible 5% to 6% increase of the portion of cells in the
g0/g1 resting phase, as compared with controls, and a
corresponding decrease in the portion of cells in the
dna synthesis phase.
to provide further support for the biologic relevance
of the  xxxg930xxx  receptors in cancer cells, we examined the
regulation of  xxxg930xxx  receptor expression by treatment
with  xxxg930xxx  agonist or antagonist. the decrease in expression of  xxxg930xxx  receptor mrna and of  xxxg930xxx  recep-

178 völker et al

tor protein by continuous treatment with  xxxg930xxx  analogue suggests that the  xxxg930xxx  agonist and the antagonist
did not induce a complete downregulation of the  xxxg930xxx 
receptor as in the pituitary gonadotrophs.18-20 treatment
for 96 hours with 10 µmol/l  xxxd3445xxx  reduced the expression of the high-affinity binding sites for  xxxg930xxx  to
maximally 79% of control. expression of mrna for the
human pituitary  xxxg930xxx  receptor was reduced to 60% of
control. comparable results are obtained by the treatment with  xxxd466xxx . these findings about the regulation
of the  xxxg930xxx  receptors are in agreement with observed
antiproliferative effects of 20% to 40% as compared with
controls. in ovarian cancer cell line efo-27, we found no
antiproliferative effects of the  xxxg930xxx  antagonist  xxxd466xxx , although the high-affinity binding site and the  xxxg930xxx 
receptor mrna expression were significantly reduced by
treatment with  xxxd466xxx . these results show that the
 xxxg930xxx  receptors in ovarian and endometrial cancer cell
lines are regulated differently, although they are similar
to the  xxxg930xxx  receptors of pituitary gonadotrophs. in
ov-1063 epithelial ovarian cancer xenografts in nude
mice, treatment with  xxxg930xxx  agonist  xxxd3445xxx  for 2
weeks decreased  xxxg930xxx  receptor concentration by 44%,
as compared with the control group.21  xxxg930xxx  antagonist
decreased the concentration of  xxxg930xxx  receptors by
53%.21  xxxg930xxx  agonists and antagonists reduce  xxxg930xxx  receptor number but do not induce a complete downregulation. thus, a homologous regulation of  xxxg930xxx  receptor
expression occurs in tumor cells, but its significance is
still obscure.
recent findings from several laboratories, including
ours, suggest that the classic  xxxg930xxx  receptor signal transduction mechanisms known to operate in the pituitary are
not involved in the mediation of antiproliferative effects of
 xxxg930xxx  analogues in cancer cell lines. data obtained during
the last years suggest rather that  xxxg930xxx  analogues interfere
with the mitogenic signal transduction of growth-factor receptors and related oncogene products that are associated
with  xxxg2198xxx  activity.2,22,23
emons et al2 found that the mitogenic effect of  xxxg681xxx  in ovarian and endometrial cancer cell
lines could be counteracted by  xxxd3445xxx , which indicates an interaction with the mitogenic signal transduction pathway. comparable data were obtained by moretti
et al24 in the human prostatic cancer cell lines lncap
and du 145. these findings are in accord with reports
that  xxxg930xxx  analogues reduce growth factor–induced  xxxg2198xxx  activity.23,25 imai et al23 showed that growth
factor–induced tyrosine phosphorylation is probably
counteracted by  xxxg930xxx  analogues through the activation
of a  xxxg401xxx . the fact that direct
antiproliferative effects of  xxxg930xxx  analogues and the associated modulation of growth factor signal transduction
were observed independently by a number of groups not
only in ovarian and endometrial cancers but also in sev-

eral other human cancers that express  xxxg930xxx  receptors,
including breast and prostate cancer,2 supports the notion that such an  xxxg930xxx -based autocrine system exists in
ovarian and endometrial cancer.
the results for the human ovarian cancer cell line
efo-27 were of particular importance.  xxxd466xxx , an
 xxxg930xxx  antagonist, reduced the receptor concentration
but had no antiproliferative effects. therefore, this cell
line could be an important model for differentiated regulation by agonistic and antagonistic  xxxg930xxx  analogues.
to prove whether our data that were obtained in
human ovarian and endometrial cancer cell lines might
be of relevance for the in vivo situation and the biologic
features of tumors that exist in patients, we examined a
number of human ovarian and endometrial cancer
biopsy specimens for their expression of  xxxg930xxx  receptors. in view of the controversial data published on this
point, we used several methods to generate data: rt-pcr,
restriction enzyme analysis, southern blot, and radioligand binding assay.
we could detect  xxxg930xxx  receptor mrna expression
and high-affinity/low-capacity binding sites for  xxxg930xxx 
analogues in 14 of 20 ovarian cancer biopsy specimens
(70%) and 5 of 6 endometrial cancer biopsy specimens
(83%; tables ii, iii). no correlation with the histologic
type and the grading of the tumors has been found so far,
however. therefore, a larger series of primary tumors
should be analyzed.
considering the fact that 70% or 83% of ovarian and
endometrial cancers, respectively, express  xxxg930xxx  receptors, it might be speculated that the proliferation of these
tumors could be reduced by  xxxg930xxx  analogue treatment.
proliferation experiments with primary cultures that are
derived from fresh ovarian and endometrial cancer
biopsy specimens will be part of further investigations. in
conclusion, our present data support the notion that
 xxxg930xxx  receptors are expressed by most ovarian and endometrial cancers. these findings could lead to novel target cell–specific therapeutic approaches that exploit the
direct antiproliferative effects of  xxxg930xxx  analogues. in addition, targeted cytotoxic therapy and radiotherapy that
uses cytotoxic or radiolabeled  xxxg930xxx  analogues might be
more efficacious2 and should be evaluated in more detail.
