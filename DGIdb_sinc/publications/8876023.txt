with the serotonin  xxxg1115xxx 
received: 11 december  xxxd1071xxx  / final version: 23 february 1996

abstract interactions of the selective serotonin reup-

take inhibitors (ssris) citalopram, fluoxetine and its
main metabolite norfluoxetine, and the tricyclic antidepressant (tca) imipramine with the rat serotonin 5ht2c receptor in a clonal cell line and in the rat choroid
plexus were investigated by radioligand binding and
phosphoinositide (pi) hydrolysis assays. for comparison, the affinities of a variety of other antidepressants
of different chemical classes for the cloned rat 5-ht2c
and 5-ht2a receptors were also determined by radioligand binding assays. fluoxetine displayed relatively
high affinity for the  xxxg1115xxx  in the choroid
plexus, with a ki value fbr inhibition of [3h]mesulergine
binding of 55.4 nm. the ki values for imipramine,
norfluoxetine and citalopram were 136 rim, 203 nm,
and 298 nm, respectively. similar rank order of potency
was detected in pi hydrolysis assays, which showed
that these drugs are antagonists at the  xxxg1115xxx  without exhibiting  xxxd1422xxx  activity.
[3h] xxxd2419xxx  (5-ht2a) binding assays revealed that
the ssris fluoxetine, norfluoxetine and citalopram
show 10- to 23-fold selectivity for the  xxxg1115xxx 
in vitro, whereas the tca imipramine does not. many
other tcas also had high to intermediate affinity for
both 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c receptors. the present data
provide evidence that fluoxetine, norfluoxetine and
citalopram, along with many other antidepressant compounds, interact directly with the  xxxg1115xxx .

introduction

monoamine reuptake inhibition is a direct effect of
many antidepressants, including the classic tricyctics
(tcas) and the more recently evolved class of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris). reuptake
inhibition occurs in vivo after acute administration of
these agents (fuller et al. 1978; for a review, see benfield
et al. 1986) but the clinical effects in man are seen only
after days or weeks of treatment (fabre and crismon
1985; rickels et al. 1986; fbr a review, see sommi et al.
1987). except for the compounds known to be functionally active at monoamine receptors in low nanomolar concentrations, such as  xxxd2637xxx , direct interaction
with receptors has not been considered to contribute
markedly to the mechanism of action of antidepressants in general. howevel; chronic treatment with many
reuptake inhibitors, including ssris, has been suggested to alter serotonin receptor regulation, but results
have been inconsistent, possibly due to methodological variations (fbr a reviews, see beasley et al. 1992).
moreovel; we have recently found that chronic treatments with fluoxetine and citalopram cause a marked
up-regulation of 5-htzc receptors in the rat choroid
plexus (laakso et al. 1996). although reuptake inhibition alone may be sufficient to cause receptor regulation, direct interactions between antidepressants and
monoamine receptors are a possibility that has been
suggested (see wong et al. 1991) and needs to be investigated. receptor binding characteristics of many antidepressants have only been studied in pig and bovine
tissues, whereas regulatory and behavioral phenomena
have been studied mostly in the rat. effects on receptor-mediated second messenger production of many

235

antidepressants, especially ssris, have not been extensively studied. in this study, we screened the binding
properties of many antidepressant compounds to the
cloned rat serotonin 5-ht2c and 5-ht2a receptors.
additionally, we selected a classic tca, imipramine,
the most widely used ssri, fluoxetine, and its main
metabolite, norfluoxetine, and a more selective ssri,
citalopram, to characterize further their 5-ht2c and
5-ht2a binding properties in the rat choroid plexus
and frontal cortex, respectively, and their functional
activity at the rat  xxxg1115xxx  in a physiological
system.

materials and methods
cell culture
a stably transfected cell line (a9: b. hoffman, nimh) expressing
the  xxxg1115xxx  and an nih 3t3 cell line (gf-6: d. julius,
university of california at san francisco) expressing the 5-ht2a
receptor were used. the cells were grown in dulbecco's modified
eagle medium with l-glutamine, ~enicillin/streptomycin, xxxg418xxx  and
10% fetal bovine serum in 75 cm- flasks until confluency. prior to
use, cells were grown for 24 h in medium containing 10% dialyzed
serum to remove endogenous serotonin present in culture medium.
for use in binding assays, cells were washed one with 10 ml cold
 xxxd3449xxx  (50 mm tris, ph 7.4), scraped into a centrifuge tube,
centrifuged at 35 000 g for 10 min, then washed with 45 ml cold
 xxxd3449xxx  for 10 rain, then centrifuged again. the 10-min wash
and centrifugation were repeated once. the pellets were stored at
-70°c until use. before assay, the pellets were resuspended in
1.5 ml cold assay buffer (50 mm tris, 10 mm mgc12, ph 7.4).
cell culture media were purchased from gibco-brl.

and centrifuged. the final pellet was resuspended in tris-hc1
before use in binding assay. the binding assays were conducted in
a total volume of 250 gl and performed in duplicate at 37°c for
30 min (choroid plexus), followed by filtration through a brandel
sm-24 cell harvester and two washes with ice-cold incubation buffer
over 0,5% polyethylenimine-presoaked whatman gf/b filters.
nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 gm 5ht.  xxxd2850xxx  (10 btm) was included to inhibit monoamine oxidase
activity. spiperone (50 nm) was used to occupy possible 5-ht2a
receptors in the choroid plexus assays. radioactivity of the samples was measured by beta counting (wallac lkb 1219 rackbeta,
wallac, turku, finland) using optiphase "hisafe" scintillation
fluid (lkb wallac, loughborough, uk). binding data were analyzed as previously described (hietala et al, i990; kuoppam~iki
et al. 1993). the [3h]mesulergine binding assay using a9 membranes
was performed as previously described by roth et al. (19921).

[3h] xxxd2419xxx  binding assay
the frontal cortex 5-ht2a binding assay was performed based on
the protocol used by leysen et al. (1982), with some modifications
according to kuoppam~iki et al. (1993). briefly, each frontal cortex sample was homogenized, washed in 0.25 m sucrose and centrifuged at 570g for 20 min. the pellet was discarded, the
supernatant diluted with tris-hc1 buffer (50 mm, ph 7.5) and
centrifuged twice at 35 000 g for 10 min with an intermediate rehomogenization. the final pellet was homogenized in tris-hc1 buffer
before use in the binding assay. binding assays were performed in
a total volume of 1.5 ml and conducted in duplicate at 37°c for
10 min. membranes were harvested and washed three times with
ice-cold incubation buffer over 0.5% polyethylenimine-presoaked
whatman gf/b filters. nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of 1 gm  xxxd2621xxx . the binding assay using gf-6 membranes was performed as previously described by roth et al. (199i).

phosphoinositide hydrolysis assay
animals and tissues used
experiments were conducted according to the "european
convention for the protection of vertebrate animals used for
experimental and other scientific purposes" (finnish statute book
1360/90). male sprague-dawley rats (harlan sprague-dawley,
indianapolis, usa) weighing 200-250 g were generously provided
by orion-farmos corporation, turku, finland. rats were housed
under standard laboratory conditions (temperature, 21°c; humidity, 55 + 5%; lights on from 6.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m.). after decapitation, choroid plexus or frontal cortex samples were dissected out,
kept on wet ice and shortly afterwards homogenized (omni 1000,
omni international, usa) in  xxxd3449xxx  (50 mm tris-hc1, ph
7.4 at room temperature) for use in binding assays. for pi hydrolysis assays, choroid plexi were carefully dissected out intact and
immediately immersed in krebs buffer to maintain physiological
environment.

[3h]mesutergine binding assay
[3hjmesulergine (78 ci/mmol, amersham international plc,
buckinghamshire, england) was used to determine antagonist binding to the  xxxg1115xxx . the protocol was based on that of
sanders-bush and breeding (1988) with some modifications made
according to kuoppam~ki et al. (1993). briefly, choroid plexi were
homogenated in  xxxd3449xxx  (50 ram, ph 7.4 at room temperature) and the homogenates were centrifuged at 35 000 g for 10 rain.
the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was rehomogenized

the 5-ht-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis was measured in rat
choroid plexus as previously described by kuoppams,ki et al. (1993).
choroid plexi were rapidly dissected out after decapitation and a
single choroid plexus (about 0.5-1.0 mg wet weight) was placed in
5 ml krebs-bicarbonate (krb) buffer (1t8 mm naci, 5.0mm
kc1, 1.3 mm cac12, 1.2 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 1.2 mm kh2po4, 25 mm
nahco3) containing i0 mm glucose. krb buffer was changed
once prior to incubation for 1 h at 37°c in a shaking water bath
with two intermediate chan~es of buffer. the samples were subsequently labeled with 1 gci [ h]inositol for 90 min in the presence
of 02/co2 (95:5). pargytine 10 gm and 10 mm lithium were added
and the incubation was continued for 15 min. the drugs, if present,
were added at the same time with  xxxd2850xxx  and lithium. thereafter,
5-ht or an equal volume of buffer, or, to determine its basal activity, a given drug, was added to give a final volume of 300 gl and
the samples were incubated for 30 min. the reaction was stopped
by addition of 940 gl chloroform/methanol (1:2, v:v). arer vortexing and allowing the tubes to stand for 155 min, 300 gl chloroform and 300 gl deionized water were added and the robes were
vortexed for 1 min and centrifuged at 1600 rpm for 10 rain. a portion (750 gl) of the upper aqueous phase containing water soluble
inositol phosphates was removed and applied to a column of
dowex-1 anion-exchange resin in the formate form. free inositol
was eluted with 10 ml 10 mm  xxxd2360xxx  ~bllowed by 10 ml 5 mm
sodium tetraborate/60 mm ammonium formate to elute glyceroinosltol phosphate. inositol monophosphate (ip) was eluted with
10 ml 200 mm ammonium formate/0.t m  xxxd2154xxx . the first
5 ml inositol monophosphate was eluted directly into scintillation
vials, while the remaining 5 ml was discarded. optiphase "hisafe"
3 (/lkb wallac, loughborough, uk) scintillation fluid was used

236
and ics0 values were calculated with graphpad inplot 4.i
(graphpad software, san diego, calil).

the choroid plexus, due to the abundance of 5-tlt2c
and lack of other serotonin receptors within, provides
a useful model for studying  xxxg1115xxx  binding
and function (conn and sanders-bush 1986; pazos
and palacios 1985). when dissected out and used
as whole choroid plexus in second messenger assays,
it provides a more physiological model of receptor
function than ctonal cell lines. furthermore, differential glycosylation of the  xxxg1115xxx  in transfected
cell lines and brain tissue has been reported, suggesting possible functional differences (abramowski
and staufenbiel 1995). in situ hybridization studies
have shown that the distribution of  xxxg1115xxx 
gene expression in the rat brain is, although plentiful
in, not limited to the choroid plexus (hoffman
and mezey 1989; molineaux et al. 1989). indeed,
5-ht2c mrna is more abundant than 5-ht2a
mrna, with expression detected in many cortical
and subcortical areas in the brain (pompeiano et al.
1994). many psychotherapeutic drugs, such as antipsychotics (canton et al. 1990; hietala et al. 1992;
roth et al. 1992) and antidepressants (jenck et al. 1993)
bind with high affinity to the  xxxg1115xxx , and
this receptor is therefore implicated in the pathogenesis and/or treatment of certain mental disorders.
in addition, chronic treatment with clozapine (hietala
et al. 1992) and some antidepressants (sanders-bush
and breeding 1988; laakso et al. i996) alter the regulation of the  xxxg1115xxx , and receptor regulation

is thought to contribute to the clinical effects of longterm psychopharmacologic treatment in general.
receptor regulation can occur as a primary response
to exposure of receptors either to ligand or to altered
levels of endogenous transmitter brought about by
reuptake inhibition, or as a result of a secondary
adaptative process, an epiphenomenon of one or both
of the above mentioned responses. the present data
suggest that citalopram, fluoxetine and norftuoxetine
may influence  xxxg1115xxx  regulation by, in
addition to inhibiting serotonin reuptake, perhaps
directly binding to the receptors.
the majority of studies involving antidepressant
treatment and receptor regulation or behavioral
models have used rats as experimental animals.
however, the receptor binding characteristics of

238
antidepressants have mainly been determined in bovine
and pig tissues. conclusions based on a combination
of bovine or pig binding data and rat experiments may
be misleading, due to the species differences in receptor binding. tcas such as  xxxd160xxx , amitriptyline,
nortriptyline and doxepin have been found to bind to
the pig choroid plexus  xxxg1115xxx  with high to
intermediate affinity (jenck et al. 1993). we found that
these agents, and, in addition, imipramine and
clomipramine, bind to the cloned 5-ht2c with ki values below 100 rim, but our results show higher affinities
for the cloned rat receptor than for the pig choroid
plexus. the ssri ftuoxetine (racemic) binds to the pig
choroid plexus and bovine choroid plexus 5-ht2c
receptor with ki values of 676 nm and 269 nm, respectively (wong et al. 1991; jenck et al. 1993). we found
that the affinity of ftuoxetine for the cloned rat 5-ht2c
receptor is much higher, with a ki value of 43 nm, and
rat choroid plexus assays yielded a ki value of 55 nm.
this is quite close to its affinity for the human 5-ht2c,
which wood et al. (1993) measured to be 35 nm.
citalopram, the most selective ssri, has low micromolar affinity for the pig and bovine choroid plexus
5-ht:c receptors, but our results show nanomolar
affinity for both the cloned (ki = 269 rim) and the
choroid plexus (ki = 298 nm) receptors.
fluoxetine and its main metabolite, norfluoxetine,
are persistent in the brain of both man (karson et al.
1993) and rat (caccia et al. 1992; torok-both et al.
1992) during treatment. concentrations up to
10.7 gg/ml fluoxetine/norfluoxetine have been estimated by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in
the human brain during long-term ftuoxetine treatment. considering the high affinity of fluoxetine and
norfluoxetine for the  xxxg1115xxx , there is reason
to believe that the 5-ht2c may be occupied during
chronic treatment by these, and we are presently conducting experiments to investigate this possibility.
combining the present data with the pharmacokinetics of fluoxetine and the latest knowledge of the dis:
tribution of 5-ht2c mrna may provide possible
explanations for phenomena observed in previous studies. for instance, mann et al. (1995) found that repeated
administration of fluoxetine eliminated (+)-l-(2,5dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (doi)-induced protein kinase c (pk-c) desensitization in rat
hippocampus (ca-l) and paraventricular thalamic
nucleus. according to pompeiano et al. (1994), 5-ht2c
mrna is found in intermediate to high densities in the
above brain regions, and since ftuoxetine has such high
affinity for the rat  xxxg1115xxx , residual
fluoxetine/norfluoxetine (antagonist) may interfere
with the binding of doi to the 5-htzc and block its
influence on the 5-ht2c mediated pi-pkc system.
also, in the paper by laakso et al. (1996), it is suggested that fluoxetine/norfluoxetine may occupy
5-ht2c receptors in vivo during chronic treatment, and
the present data support this possibility.

in addition to receptor binding studies, we must
assess the intracellular functional responses to ligandreceptor interaction. receptor activation may occur in
the absence of agonist (gerione et al. 1984; westphal
and sanders-bush 1994). some antagonists, including
5-htzc antagonists, possess negative intrinsic activity,
i.e. they inhibit constitutive stimulation of second messenger production and are called inverse agonists (han
and minneman 1991; harker et al. 1994; for a review,
see milligan et al. 1995). also, chronic treatment with
clozapine has been shown to attenuate the basal activity of 5-htzc receptors in the rat choroid plexus
(kuoppam~iki et al. 1994). in the synapse, when the
physiological agonist is present, neutral antagonists,
inverse agonists and, to some extent, partial agonists,
cause inhibition of second messenger production,
whereas full agonists act synergistically with the
endogenous tigand. in addition to increasing the concentration of serotonin or noradrenaline in the synaptic cleft via reuptake inhibition, most antidepressants
act as antagonists at the  xxxg1115xxx  in an in vivo
model (jenck et al. 1993). the present results confirm
that finding in a physiological system in vitro for the
selected ssris. the pi hydrolysis assays revealed that
ftuoxetine, norfluoxetine, citalopram and imipramine
inhibit 5-ht-induced pi hydrolysis in the rat choroid
plexus, but did not affect basal second messenger production, suggesting they are neutral antagonists of the
 xxxg1115xxx . whether direct antagonism of 5ht2c receptors by these ssris is relevant in relation
to their effect on serotonin reuptake inhibition remains
equivocal as long as the true concentrations of ssris
in the synapse remain unknown.
a phenomenon consistently observed (kuoppam/iki
et al. 1995) with antagonists of the  xxxg1115xxx 
was reproduced here - the ki values for inhibition of
5-ht stimulated pi hydrolysis were up to 10-fold higher
than the ki values for receptor binding. this may be
due to the dominance of spare (gtp-insensitive) receptors in the choroid plexus where gtp-sensitive (high
agonist affinity) state represents only about 10% of the
total 5-ht2c receptors (appel et al. 1990; sandersbush and breeding 1990; havlik and peroutka 1992;
leonhardt et al. 1992). thus, a greater concentration
of antagonist may be needed to inhibit 5-ht stimulated p! hydrolysis which is dependent on the stimulation of gtp-sensitive receptors than to displace inverse
agonist [3h]mesutergine binding. however, it is unclear
whether this is the case in other brain areas in as much
as it is not known whether spare receptors predominate outside the choroid plexus.
in conclusion, we found that the ssris fluoxetine,
its main metabolite norfluoxetine, and citalopram display nanomolar affinity for both the cloned and rat
choroid plexus  xxxg1115xxx  and they, along with
the tca imipramine, are antagonists at this receptor.
excluding sertraline which, interestingly, did not show
significant binding to either the 5-ht2c or the 5-ht2a

receptor; the s s r i s in this s t u d y s h o w u p to 23-fold
