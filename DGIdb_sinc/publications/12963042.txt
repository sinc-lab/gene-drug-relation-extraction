 xxxd3314xxx  resistance in a pleiotropic yeast mutant is caused by a single point mutation in the erg1 gene.  a  xxxd3314xxx -resistant mutant of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae with a complex pleiotropic phenotype (resistance to  xxxd3314xxx  and itraconazole, sensitivity to several antifungal compounds, respiration deficiency, and temperature sensitivity) has been isolated after chemical mutagenesis. detailed analysis revealed that some of its traits (thermosensitive growth, sensitivity to the polyene antimycotic nystatin and to calcofluor white) are linked to alterations in the cell wall. a single c1288g base change in the erg1 gene resulting in the substitution of proline by alanine at position 430 in the enzyme  xxxg2197xxx  (erg1p) was identified as the sole cause of  xxxd3314xxx  resistance. this novel mutation in the erg1 gene confers only partial resistance of erg1p to  xxxd3314xxx , however, even the low level of resistance enables  xxxd3314xxx -treated mutant cells to maintain adequate ergosterol levels over longer cultivation periods. lack of interference of squalene accumulation with growth of  xxxd3314xxx -treated mutant cells indicates that the antimycotic effect of  xxxd3314xxx  in s. cerevisiae may be linked primarily to ergosterol depletion.
