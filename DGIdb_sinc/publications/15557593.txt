purpose
a transgenic mouse model has revealed parameters of the angiogenic switch during multistep tumorigenesis of pancreatic islets, and demonstrated efficacy of antiangiogenic therapies. pericytes have been revealed as functionally important for tumor neovasculature,
using kinase inhibitors targeting their platelet-derived growth factor receptors (pdgfrs).
additionally,  xxxg2413xxx  receptor ( xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx ) inhibitors and metronomic
chemotherapy show modest benefit against early- but not late-stage disease.
materials and methods
seeking to improve efficacy against otherwise intractable end-stage pancreatic islet tumors,
two receptor  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors, imatinib and  xxxd3264xxx , were used to disrupt pdgfrmediated pericyte support of tumor endothelial cells in concert with maximum-tolerated dose
(mtd) or metronomic chemotherapy and/or  xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx  inhibition.
results
imatinib, despite equivocal efficacy as monotherapy, reduced pericyte coverage of tumor vessels and enhanced efficacy in combination with metronomic chemotherapy or  xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx  inhibition. a regimen involving all three was even better. mtd using cyclophosphamide caused
transitory regression, but then rapid regrowth, in contrast to metronomic cyclophosphamide
plus imatinib, which produced stable disease. the mtd regimen elicited apoptosis of tumor
cells but not endothelial cells, whereas the other regimens increased endothelial cell apoptosis concordant with efficacy. a ‘‘chemo-switch’’ protocol, involving sequential mtd and then
metronomic chemotherapy, overlaid with multitargeted inhibition of  xxxg1710xxx  and  xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx , gave
complete responses and unprecedented survival advantage in this model.
conclusion
this study demonstrates a potentially tractable clinical strategy in a stringent preclinical
model, wherein standard-of-care chemotherapy is followed by a novel maintenance regimen:
pdfgr is targeted to disrupt pericyte support, while metronomic chemotherapy and/or
 xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx  inhibitors target consequently sensitized endothelial cells, collectively destabilizing
pre-existing tumor vasculature and inhibiting ongoing angiogenesis.

introduction

the endothelial cell compartment is an attractive target for anticancer therapy as a result of the now evident importance of the
tumor vasculature for sustaining tumor
growth and metastasis.1-5 dozens of angiogenesis inhibitors are in clinical trials or

preclinical development for cancer indications6 and one, the vascular endothelial
growth factor (vegf) inhibitor bevacizumab (avastin; genentech, south san francisco, ca), has been approved.7 in addition
to this pipeline of ‘‘designer drugs,’’ it
has recently become apparent that tumor

endothelial cells are sensitive to the action of conventional
cytotoxic drugs, if the dosing regimen is altered. the concept, known as antiangiogenic scheduling or metronomic
chemotherapy, was demonstrated in preclinical studies using transplanted tumor models.8-12 while most standard
chemotherapies likely target the proliferating endothelial
cells in tumors, the obligatory rest periods in traditional
maximum-tolerated dose (mtd) regimens of chemotherapy are thought to allow the endothelial cells to recover
by using their intact p53-based damage sensor to effect
g1 arrest, allowing genome repair and thereby diminishing
the antiangiogenic effects of the treatment.8,11,12 metronomic chemotherapy involves regular administration of
cytotoxic drugs at doses that are low enough to avoid
myleosuppression and other dose-limiting side effects
that otherwise obligate rest periods, thus continuously exposing the more slowly proliferating tumor endothelial cells
to damaging actions of the cytotoxic drug, thereby limiting
their opportunity to repair and recover. the incorporation
into metronomic chemotherapy regimens of antiangiogenic
drugs, such as  xxxd1330xxx  or inhibitors of vegf receptors
(vegfrs) or matrix metalloproteases, has been shown to
further enhance efﬁcacy in preclinical models.8,9,13
while the tumor endothelial cell is increasingly accepted as a valid target for cancer therapies, another vascular cell type, the pericyte, has recently been recognized as
a potentially important, and complimentary, target. pericytes are ﬁbroblastic/smooth muscle-like cells found in
close contact with endothelial cells in small blood vessels
and capillaries, where they serve as regulators of blood vessel formation and function.14 pericyte homeostasis is regulated in signiﬁcant part by signaling through the plateletderived growth factor ligand/receptor (pdgf/ xxxg1710xxx )
system.15-19 pericytes have begun to attract attention as
drug targets due to their apparent involvement in a variety
of diseases and disorders, including cancer, diabetic retinopathy, and atherosclerosis.14 moreover, pericytes are
thought to provide endothelial cells with crucial survival
signals,20 the complete nature of which remains to be elucidated, but evidently includes signaling by angiopoietin121 and n-cadherin.22
in the current study, we investigate the effect of targeting pericytes (via inhibition of pdgfrs) on the efﬁcacy of
metronomic chemotherapy and endothelial cell survival in
the  xxxg1959xxx   xxxg2397xxx -tag2 transgenic mouse model of pancreatic
neuroendocrine cancer.23 the tumors that arise in this
mouse model from targeted oncogene expression in the
insulin-producing beta cells are ostensibly similar to the
non–multiple endocrine neoplasia class of human islet
tumors, although careful cross-comparative studies on molecular signatures have not been performed. rather, the
model is viewed as a general prototype for the stepwise process of tumor development and progression via distinctive lesional stages thought to reﬂect rate-limiting secondary events.
940

notably, the angiogenic switch was ﬁrst identiﬁed as one of
those events, being activated in the multifocal premalignant
phase of this pathway and subsequently sustained, critical
for tumor formation, growth, and progression.3,24 the experimental design (fig 1) was motivated by preclinical trials of receptor  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors in this model that revealed
synergistic efﬁcacy when endothelial cells and pericytes were
jointly targeted by drugs that inhibited  xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1710xxx ,
respectively.25 inhibition of  xxxg1710xxx  was associated with
pericyte detachment from tumor vessels, apparently rendering
the endothelial cells more susceptible to the effects of
 xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx  blockade. studies in traditional xenotransplant tumor models have also shown beneﬁts in jointly targeting
 xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1710xxx , and documented pericyte disruption
in tumors,26,27 suggestive of a general mechanism. we
reasoned that pericyte detachment induced by  xxxg1710xxx 
inhibition would also sensitize the endothelial cells to
chemotherapy, in particular metronomic chemotherapy,
and evaluate that possibility herein. furthermore, we assess
the beneﬁts of combining multitargeted  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors, concurrently directed against  xxxg1710xxx  and  xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx ,
with metronomic chemotherapy. finally, we design and validate a new ‘‘chemo-switch’’ protocol, combining an analog
of a standard-of-care mtd regimen with metronomic chemotherapy and novel multitargeted kinase inhibitors, the
results of which encourage consideration of clinical trials
aimed to assess the potential of chemo-switch regimens
for treating human cancers.
materials and methods
animal care
all animal studies described were approved by the local
committee for animal care. from 12 weeks of age, all rip1tag2 mice received 50% sugar food (harlan teklad, madison,
wi) and 5% sugar water to relieve hypoglycemia induced by
the insulin-secreting tumors.
drugs and treatments
the drug doses were set at a concentration that alone, or in
combination with other drugs, did not cause drug-related deaths
or weight loss of more than 15%. imatinib (ucsf medical center
pharmacy, san francisco, ca) was administered orally by gavage in
a volume of 100 ␮l of phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) at a total
dose of 150 mg/kg⫺1 ⫻ day⫺1, divided into one administration
of 50 mg/kg⫺1 in the morning, and one of 100 mg/kg⫺1 in the
afternoon. su10944 (sugen, south san francisco, ca) was
administered orally by gavage in a volume of 100 ␮l of a carboxymethylcellulose suspension at a dose of 100 mg/kg⫺1 ⫻ day⫺1.
 xxxd3264xxx  (sugen, south san francisco, ca) was administered
orally by gavage in a volume of 100 ␮l at a dose of 40 mg/kg⫺1 ⫻
day⫺1. after 6 weeks of treatment in the survival trial, mice treated
with  xxxd3264xxx  displayed signs of fatigue, and treatment was
changed to 40 mg/kg⫺1 ⫻ day⫺1 delivered on 5 consecutive
days, followed by 2 days of rest for the remainder of the trial.
for the purpose of metronomic scheduling of cyclophosphamide

fresh every week at a concentration of 20 mg/ml and stored in 4°c.
twice weekly, 0.66 ml of the stock solution was diluted in 200 ml
of 5% sugar water, approximating an estimated dose of ctx of
10 mg/kg⫺1 ⫻ day⫺1 for each mouse. the mtd regimen of ctx
for  xxxg1959xxx   xxxg2397xxx -tag2 mice was delivered as a previously reported 21-day
cycle9 of 105 mg/kg⫺1 administered intraperitoneally every other
day for a total of three doses, followed by 2 weeks of rest. the total
dose was chosen because of severe toxicity in terms of weight loss and
morbidity in  xxxg1959xxx   xxxg2397xxx -tag2 mice associated with higher doses.
experimental trials
drug treatments were started when the mice reached an age
of 12 weeks, except for mice treated with imatinib, which were
pretreated for 3 days. mice were continuously monitored for
signs of hypoglycemic shock or drug side effects and were sacriﬁced if found cachexic or if body weight loss exceeded 15%. for
regression trials, following 4 weeks of treatment, mice were anesthetized and heart perfused using 10 ml pbs, followed by 10 ml
10% zinc-buffered formalin (medical chemical corp, torrance,
ca). subsequently, the pancreas and spleen of the mice were dissected and macroscopic tumors (⬎ 1 ⫻ 1 mm) were excised and
measured and the number of tumors in each mouse was noted.
tumor volume was calculated using the formula v z a*b2*␲/6,
where a and b equal the longer and the shorter diameter of the
tumor, respectively. the tumor volume of all tumors from each
mouse was combined to arrive at the total tumor burden. tumors were then ﬁxed in 10% zinc-formalin for 1 hour at 4°c
and subsequently placed in pbs containing 30% sucrose until
the tissue sank to the bottom. then the tissue was embedded
in optimal cutting temperature medium and frozen for cryosectioning and histologic analysis.

immunostaining
cryosections (10 ␮m) from tumors were allowed to dry in
air for 10 minutes before they were equilibrated in pbs three
times for 5 minutes. following blocking of nonspeciﬁc binding
using a serum-free protein block (dako, carpinteria, ca) for
45 minutes at room temperature (rt), sections were incubated
in pbs ⫹ 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (wash buffer) containing
polyclonal antibodies directed against  xxxg1724xxx  (1:100; pharmingen,
san diego, ca) and  xxxg537xxx  (1:400; chemicon, temecula, ca) over
night at 4°c. subsequently, sections were washed in wash buffer
three times for 10 minutes and further incubated for 60 minutes
with secondary antibodies coupled to ﬂuorescent labels (1:100;
jackson immunolaboratories, west grove pa) at rt. after washing in wash buffer three times for 10 minutes, sections were
mounted in solution containing dapi (vector, burlingame, ca).
tunel staining
cryosections (10 ␮m) from tumors were allowed to dry in air
for 10 minutes before they were equilibrated in pbs three times for
5 minutes. subsequently, sections were preincubated with tdt
buffer (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) for 10 minutes at rt and then incubated in tdt buffer containing 200 u/ml tdt enzyme and
4 ␮mol/l digoxigenin-conjugated dutp (enzo life sciences,
farmingdale, ny) for 30 minutes at 37°c. following washing three
times for 5 minutes in pbs, sections were incubated with ﬂuorescein-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibodies over night at 4°c.
after washing three times for 5 minutes in pbs, sections were
mounted in solution containing dapi.

results

imatinib enhances the efﬁcacy of metronomic
cyclophosphamide in  xxxg1959xxx   xxxg2397xxx -tag2 mice
the  xxxg1959xxx   xxxg2397xxx -tag2 transgenic mouse model of pancreatic
islet carcinogenesis23 has been used to elucidate mechanisms employed by tumors to activate the angiogenic
switch24,28 and to assess the impact of antiangiogenic drugs
on the distinctive stages of multistep tumor development.13,25,29,30 the relative synchronicity with which neuroendocrine tumors (insulinomas) develop from 400
oncogene-expressing islet progenitor lesions in the pancreas through successive temporal stages—hyperplastic/
dysplastic islets, angiogenic islets, and progressive grades
of islet carcinoma—enabled the design of three distinctive
preclinical trials, targeting the angiogenic switch in progenitor lesions, or asymptomatic small tumors, or advanced near-end-stage cancers.29 in this study we
focused on the latter, called a regression trial, as it most

closely mimics the typical situation in the clinic, where
a patient presents with advanced disease and signiﬁcant
tumor burden. the activity proﬁles of the kinase inhibitors
used in this study are summarized in table 1. a previous
study documented that pdgfrs are predominantly expressed by, and functionally important for, maintenance
of pericytes in the vasculature of  xxxg1959xxx   xxxg2397xxx -tag2 tumors,25 presenting imatinib (gleevec; novartis, basel, switzerland;
table 1) as a relatively selective, pericyte-targeting drug.
the oncogene-expressing tumor cells in this model do
not express any of the four pdgf ligands or either of
the two pdgfrs in vivo25 or in culture (unpublished results); thus, imatinib is not expected to interfere with autocrine tumor growth. to assess whether imatinib could
enhance the efﬁcacy of metronomic chemotherapy by dissociating pericytes from endothelial cells, we performed
a regression trial. treatment of  xxxg1959xxx   xxxg2397xxx -tag2 mice was
started at 12 weeks of age, at which point the mice had several well-established solid tumors. metronomic chemotherapy involving ctx was administered continuously
through the drinking water, alone or in combination
with twice-daily administration of imatinib, until 16 weeks
of age. control mice were sacriﬁced at 12 weeks of age to
determine the initial tumor burden of the mice in these
highly synchronous, age-matched cohorts, and at 14.5
weeks, when approximately half of the untreated mice
had died from the effects of their tumors. consistent
with previous results,25 treatment with imatinib alone
did not demonstrably affect the growth of tumors, and
the mice had to be sacriﬁced at the same time (14.5 weeks)
as the untreated control group (fig 2a). in accordance
with previous studies in the  xxxg1959xxx   xxxg2397xxx -tag2 model,13,36 in
this study the mice treated with metronomic ctx had a reduced average tumor burden of 59.5 ␮l at 16 weeks compared with the 14.5-week control group burden of 91.8 ␮l
(fig 2a). the combination of imatinib and metronomic
ctx resulted in apparent stable disease, with an average
tumor burden of 30.4 ␮l at the prescribed end point of
the trial (fig 2a), comparable to that of mice analyzed
at the 12-week starting point of the trial (29.6 ␮l), and
signiﬁcantly lower than metronomic ctx alone. notably,
none of these treatments produced obvious toxicity,

suggesting the existence of a therapeutic window in that
deleterious effects (eg, pericyte dissociation) were evident
in tumor but not normal tissue vasculature, including that
of the exocrine pancreas in which the neuroendocrine tumors and their progenitor lesions are embedded, consistent with a previous report.25
since metronomic chemotherapy is still largely an investigational drug protocol, we also assessed an analog of
a standard-of-care mtd chemotherapeutic regimen for
comparison, also using ctx. although ctx is not traditionally used against human neuroendocrine tumors, we
chose to use it based on preliminary studies indicating
that mtd ctx had activity against these mouse tumors,
reasoning that use of the same drug in metronomic and
mtd regimens would facilitate comparison. the mtd
regimen consisted of a 1-week treatment series (one

dose given every other day for a total of three doses), followed by 2 weeks of rest, another week of treatment, and
then immediate termination of the trial at the deﬁned ⫹4week end point for a regression trial. the mice treated with
mtd ctx had a similar tumor burden at 16 weeks to that
at the start of the trial (fig 2a). this regimen ostensibly
produced a condition of stable disease, comparable to
metronomic ctx plus imatinib and better than metronomic ctx alone, a condition that was, however, transitory, as shown in the following sections. moreover, in
contrast to mice treated with metronomic ctx, either
alone or in combination with imatinib and/or a  xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx 
inhibitor (see following sections), none of which showed
obvious signs of toxicity such as weight loss, mice treated
with mtd ctx lost approximately 15% of their body
weight during the course of the trial (data not shown).
we next performed a regression/survival trial, in
which treatment starts at 12 weeks of age and persists until
death is imminent or a milestone at 24 weeks of age is
reached. this trial places stringent demands on treatment
regimens due to the multifocal nature of the model and the
physiological stress of hyperinsulinemia and pancreatic
disruption. consequently, mice left untreated will die
shortly after the trial commences, with a median survival
of only 2.5 weeks (fig 2b). treatment with metronomic
ctx extended median survival to 4.5 weeks (fig 2b).
the median survival of mice treated with the combination
of imatinib and metronomic ctx was 6.1 weeks, signiﬁcantly prolonged compared to metronomic ctx alone
(fig 2b). we also tested the combination of imatinib
and mtd ctx to assess possible combinatorial beneﬁt,
both for completeness and in light of previous studies
showing that imatinib reduces tumor interstitial ﬂuid
pressure and thereby enhances drug delivery into solid tumors.37,38 tumor burden was reduced compared with the
single agents at 16 weeks, but there was no survival beneﬁt
(data not shown), likely due to the rapid resistance that
develops to mtd ctx (see following sections).
treatment with imatinib and metronomic ctx
reduces pericyte coverage of tumor
blood vessels
our therapeutic trial design was based on the proposition that  xxxg1710xxx  blockage would cause pericyte dissociation from tumor vessels. therefore, we assessed the extent
of pericyte coverage of tumor blood vessels following
treatment with metronomic ctx alone, or in combination
with imatinib. as witnessed by immunostaining for the
pericyte marker  xxxg537xxx , z60% of the blood vessel area in
 xxxg1959xxx   xxxg2397xxx -tag2 tumors was covered by pericytes (figs 3a
and b). treatment with metronomic ctx did not alter
the extent of pericyte coverage of tumor blood vessels
(figs 3a and b). in contrast, treatment with the combination of imatinib and metronomic ctx signiﬁcantly

reduced pericyte coverage on tumor blood vessels, to 31.3%

extending previous results25 that normal vasculature is
comparably insensitive to pericyte disruption by inhibition
of  xxxg1710xxx , indicative of a substantive difference in normal
versus tumor endothelial-pericyte homeostasis, revealing
the existence of a therapeutic window.

we have previously reported on the beneﬁts of jointly

metronomic chemotherapy.9,13 now we have demonstrated that a  xxxg1710xxx  inhibitor enhances the therapeutic

made use of the orally bioavailable, relatively selective
 xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx   xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor su10944 (table 1).33
treatment of  xxxg1959xxx   xxxg2397xxx -tag2 mice from 12 to 16 weeks of
age with su10944 alone for 4 weeks resulted in a modest
retardation of tumor growth (fig 4a). notably,  xxxg1959xxx   xxxg2397xxx -tag2
tumor cells do not express  xxxg800xxx  or -2, as shown in
previous studies,3,28 making antiangiogenic effects the
most likely basis for the observed response. the combination of su10944 with either imatinib or metronomic ctx
proved to be more efﬁcacious than any of the monotherapies (figs 2a and 4a), in that the mice had tumor burdens
at the 16-week deﬁned end point comparable with the
starting point of the trial (apparent stable disease; fig

multitargeted inhibition of angiogenesis

immunostaining with antibodies against  xxxg1724xxx , an
endothelial cell antigen, revealed that treatment of rip1tag2 mice with metronomic ctx reduced tumor blood
vessel density (figs 5a and b). in parallel, the endothelial
cell apoptotic index was increased (fig 5c). the combination of imatinib and metronomic ctx further reduced the
blood vessel density by 52.7% and increased the apoptotic
index of endothelial cells by 2.2-fold (figs 5a-c). in
marked contrast, treatment with mtd ctx did not affect
vessel density or endothelial cell apoptosis of  xxxg1959xxx   xxxg2397xxx -tag2
tumors (figs 5a-c), illustrating that, even though the efﬁcacy of mtd ctx versus imatinib plus metronomic ctx
was similar in a 4-week regression trial, the two treatment
regimens were not targeting the same tumor compartment. the fact that an increased rate of tumor cell apoptosis was observed following the ﬁrst week of treatment with
mtd ctx compared with control-treated tumors (data
not shown) further demonstrates that mtd chemotherapy is largely targeting the oncogene-expressing p53 deﬁcient cancer cells, and not endothelial cells or pericytes.
the triple combination of imatinib, su10944, and metronomic ctx dramatically reduced blood vessel density
(⫺89.6%) and elicited a 12.5-fold increase in endothelial
cell apoptosis compared with control tumors (figs 5a-c).

4a); thus both combinations were beneﬁcial, consistent
with previous reports.9,13,25 since all three pair-wise combinations had additive beneﬁt, we combined the three
agents. the result was substantial reduction in tumor burden (fig 4a). the mice treated with su10944, imatinib,
and metronomic ctx exhibited an average tumor burden
of 5.6 ␮l, compared with 29.6 ␮l at the start of the trial
(fig 4a). consistent with the tumor burden data, the median survival of mice treated with the triple combination
was 10.6 weeks, compared with 4.5 weeks and 5 weeks for
su10944 plus metronomic ctx and su10944 plus imatinib, respectively (fig 4b). we thus conclude that multitargeted inhibition of angiogenesis in combination with
metronomic chemotherapy produces objective responses
in established tumors and signiﬁcantly prolongs survival
of  xxxg1959xxx   xxxg2397xxx -tag2 mice.

tumor burden over time in a regression trial, comparing
the standard regimen with the similarly efﬁcacious combination of imatinib plus metronomic ctx. as expected, after the ﬁrst week of treatment with mtd ctx, tumors

course of the trial (fig 6); there was no rapid regression,
nor was there rebound and expansion.
chemo-switch regimen regresses established
tumors and prolongs survival
seeing that the mtd ctx regimen produced an initial dramatic regression of tumors followed by a rapid rebound, whereas the imatinib plus metronomic ctx
regimen effected stable disease without regression, and
since certain tumors that are resistant to mtd chemotherapy can still respond to a metronomic treatment regimen,9
we reasoned that by switching mice to a regimen of metronomic ctx following an initial period of mtd chemotherapy (a chemo-switch regimen), we would be able to
achieve long-term treatment beneﬁts. indeed, treatment
with the chemo-switch regimen proved signiﬁcantly
more efﬁcacious in terms of reducing tumor burden
than mtd ctx alone (fig 7a). moreover, the chemoswitch regimen in combination with imatinib further enhanced efﬁcacy (fig 7a). the chemo-switch regimen also
signiﬁcantly improved the median survival of the mice,
from 5.5 weeks for mtd ctx to 6.8 weeks and 8 weeks
for the chemo-switch regimen, alone or in combination
with imatinib, respectively (fig 7b).
combining multitargeted angiogenesis
inhibition with the chemo-switch regimen

to investigate whether the efﬁcacy of the chemo-switch
regimen could be further improved by concomitant inhibition of pdgfrs and vegfrs, we treated mice with the

including highly angiogenic renal cancers; this agent is a potent inhibitor of several receptor tyrosine kinases including

trials of positive preclinical results obtained with  xxxd3264xxx 
would be tractable. another logical multitargeting strategy
with clinical translatability would have been imatinib plus
bevacizumab, except for the conundrum that the latter
does not target mouse vegf, making the combination nonapplicable to this de novo mouse model of cancer. in work to
be presented elsewhere,  xxxd3264xxx  was evaluated as a monotherapy in both regression and regression/survival trials.
 xxxd3264xxx  produced stable disease in a 4-week regression
trial, and both reduced tumor burden and conveyed a survival advantage in a regression/survival trial (data not shown;
g. bergers, personal communication, august 2004). the
combination of  xxxd3264xxx  with the chemo-switch regimen
improved this efﬁcacy in both trials: the combinatorial

the 4-week regression trial; the average tumor burden was

four of six mice treated with  xxxd3264xxx  plus the chemoswitch regimen were still alive at the predeﬁned endpoint
at 24 weeks of age (fig 7b). furthermore, two of the surviving mice had complete responses to treatment and were
tumor-free at the 24-week end point, whereas the other
two had small lesions (fig 7a). further trials on larger cohorts
will be required to see if there is modest regrowth from 16
to 24 weeks as suggested by the data, which is currently
not statistically signiﬁcant in the comparison of tumor burden at the two end points. the treatment appeared well tolerated; no weight loss was observed and the well-being of the
mice was normal. however, fatigue, a common side effect
from treatment with  xxxd3264xxx  in patients,41 was observed

multitargeted ‘‘chemo-switch’’ regimen

managed by altering the  xxxd3264xxx  dosing to a 5-day-on/
2-day-off regimen, while continuing metronomic chemotherapy. we thus conclude that treatment with a
multitargeted inhibitor of angiogenesis together with a
chemo-switch regimen impressively prolongs survival in a
remarkably challenging mouse model of cancer, recognizing its prevalent oncogene expression throughout the
endocrine pancreas and consequent multifocal progression
of disease.
discussion

we report that inhibition of  xxxg1710xxx  signaling, by administration of imatinib or a multitargeted kinase inhibitor,
enhances the efﬁcacy of metronomic chemotherapy in
a transgenic mouse model of neuroendocrine cancer.
treatment with imatinib reduced the pericyte coverage
of tumor blood vessels, apparently rendering endothelial
cells more sensitive to the damaging action of cytotoxic
drugs. furthermore, treatment with the combination of
imatinib, metronomic chemotherapy, and su10944 (a selective  xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx  kinase inhibitor) elicited regression of established tumors and prolonged median survival of the
mice. lastly, by combining an initial mtd chemotherapeutic regimen with maintenance therapy consisting of
metronomic chemotherapy plus the multitargeted kinase
inhibitor  xxxd3264xxx , remarkable efﬁcacy was achieved in
terms of objective response to treatment and survival. a
summary of the efﬁcacy and survival beneﬁt obtained
with the various treatment regimens evaluated in this
study is presented in table 2.
pericytes promote stabilization of blood vessels via
cell-cell contact and/or secreted factors, 14,20,42,43 and
pdgf signaling is evidently involved in their regulation.
thus, mice defective in pdgf-b/ xxxg1710xxx -␤ display abnormal development and maturation of the vasculature due to

impaired recruitment of pericytes and smooth muscle
cells.44,45 administration to newborn mice of neutralizing
antibodies for the pdgf-␤–receptor results in severe vascular malformation in the retina due to a lack of pericyte
recruitment.46 now, in this and several recent reports, it
has been shown that pericyte function in tumor blood vessels is impaired following treatment with  xxxg1710xxx  inhibitors.25-27 notably, normal tissue vasculature was not
evidently disrupted by  xxxg1710xxx  inhibition, and there was
no obvious toxicity, suggesting that other signals normally
help maintain endothelial-pericyte interactions in quiescent blood vessels, thus affording a therapeutic window.
looking forward, it will be important to further investigate
the prospect that inhibition of  xxxg1710xxx  to effect pericyte
disruption in tumors could serve as a general strategy
for enhancing the efﬁcacy of agents targeting tumor endothelial cells,15 and to assess potential toxicities not evident
in this study, such as the edema associated with inhibition
of  xxxg1710xxx  seen in certain tumor types.47-49 furthermore,
it will be pertinent to utilize agents (monoclonal antibodies, ligand aptamers, etc) targeting mouse  xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx  and
 xxxg1710xxx  with higher selectivity to further substantiate
the mechanistic hypothesis; meanwhile, the weight of
the evidence from this and previous studies3,5,13,25-28 supports the conceptual basis of the design principle that targeting both pericytes and endothelial cells in the tumor
vasculature produces signiﬁcant therapeutic beneﬁts.
this study adds further support for the potential therapeutic value of metronomic chemotherapy,11 and moreover
suggests a strategy for enhancing its antiangiogenic efﬁcacy,
involving concurrent inoculation of a drug that sensitizes tumor endothelial cells by disrupting pericyte support functions (fig 1). in considering how one might translate this
new concept into clinical practice, we devised (and demonstrated the utility of) a multitargeted chemo-switch protocol
(fig 8) that should be adaptable for testing in clinical trials,

having the following parameters: (1) standard-of-care
(mtd) chemotherapy (or in principle radiotherapy), followed by (2) multitargeted antiangiogenic maintenance
therapy, involving: disruption of pericyte support of tumor
endothelial cells (eg, with  xxxg1710xxx  inhibitors such as imatinib
or multitargeted kinase inhibitors); metronomic chemotherapy targeting the sensitized endothelial cells, ideally orally
bioavailable and low-dose/low toxicity; and direct inhibition
of endothelial cell functions and survival (eg, with
 xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx  inhibitors, or multitargeted receptor  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors, or vegf ligand blockade, such as with
bevacizumab).
the notion is that standard of care must be used, and
moreover can serve to de-bulk a tumor by directly targeting the cancer cells. then, before the inevitable rebound
and regrowth (resistance), a multitargeted, antiangiogenic
maintenance regimen is initiated, exploiting the results of
this and previous studies to render both metronomic chemotherapy and other drugs targeting endothelial cells
more efﬁcacious by disrupting crucial pericyte support
with  xxxg1710xxx  inhibitors. we show that a multitargeted kinase inhibitor,  xxxd3264xxx , has particular promise for incorporation into this therapeutic strategy, and suggest that
clinical trials in a chemo-switch regimen be considered.
similarly, the chemo-switch regimen could be tested in
the clinic by using bevacizumab to target the endothelial
compartment, imatinib to target pericytes, low-dose oral
ctx as the metronomic chemotherapy, and standard of
care for the particular cancer indication (fig 8).
it should be emphasized that the particular disease indications where this strategy might prove most successful
remain to be determined in the course of clinical trials that
incorporate these design principles in the context of the
particular characteristics and accepted treatment modalities for a given tumor type. we do not necessarily predict
that analogous pancreatic non-men neuroendocrine tumors will be the most amenable, although it would be

design, involving sequential standardof-care (maximum-tolerated dose

chemotherapy combined with multitargeted inhibition of pericytes and
endothelial cells in the angiogenic
tumor vasculature, using drugs directed at their platelet-derived growth
factor receptor ( xxxg1710xxx ) and vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor
( xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx ), respectively.

interesting to test the possibility. rather, viewing the
rip-tag2 model as a general prototype for de novo tumor
progression, we imagine other tumor types, particularly
ones that are highly vascularized, vegf-expressing, and
pericyte rich, might respond to a chemo-switch trial design.
there is precedent to the chemo-switch regimen explored in the present study11; for example, children with
acute lymphoblastic leukemia are successfully treated
with a long-term maintenance chemotherapy regimen following a high-dose standard regimen.50 as for the choice of
the metronomic chemotherapy, in our view the best option
would be oral and low-dose/low toxicity (eg, 50 mg/d ctx
pills).11,51 since the metronomic chemotherapy is targeting
the endothelial cells, in contrast to the mtd standard of
care, which primarily affects the overt tumor cells, it is possible that the same agent can be used in both phases of the
chemo-switch regimen, as we have demonstrated herein in
a preclinical model, even if resistance has developed to the
mtd. indeed, there are examples of patients responding to
a more frequent, but low-dose, administration of chemotherapeutic drugs after having progressed on a conventional
schedule of the same drug.52-54 nevertheless, there may be
good reason to use different drugs in the mtd and metronomic phases of the chemo-switch protocol, and we are exploring such possibilities in the mouse model.
the introduction of targeted cancer therapeutics into
the clinic has been greatly anticipated. however, the initial
reports from clinical trials using various targeted drugs as
monotherapies, or in combination with mtd chemotherapy, have been sobering. it is increasingly appreciated that
sustainable tumor regression and long-term survival will
likely come from rationally designed combinations of targeted therapeutics and/or conventional chemotherapeutic
agents that collectively target different cell types that contribute to tumor progression, including the tumor cells
themselves, endothelial cells, pericytes, cancer-associated
ﬁbroblasts, and inﬁltrating tumor-enhancing, proangiojournal

multitargeted ‘‘chemo-switch’’ regimen

genic leukocytes.55 to that end, it will be increasingly important to test combinations of clinically approved drugs,
or drugs in late-stage clinical trials, in the preclinical setting, using organ-speciﬁc mouse models of human cancer
development and progression to guide the design of future
studies in patients. the striking results of this study suggest new avenues involving the use of imatinib and other
 xxxg1710xxx  inhibitors to target pericytes and thereby sensitize
tumor endothelial cells to cytotoxic killing. a chemoswitch protocol that incorporates this knowledge into a
clinical trial design integrating standard-of-care mtd chemotherapy with a novel regimen of multitargeted, metronomic inhibition of tumor angiogenesis has prospect for
producing enduring responses.
