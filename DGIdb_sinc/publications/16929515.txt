we evaluated dna polymorphisms in the  xxxg2366xxx 
(ts) and 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase ( xxxg1475xxx )
genes for an association with response and survival in locally
advanced gastric cancer treated with 5-fu based preoperative
chemotherapy (ctx). dna of 238 patients (ctx-group: total
n 5 135, completely resected (r0) n 5 102; without ctx: r0
n 5 103) was isolated from blood or from nontumorous tissues.
in the ctx-group, genotyping of the tandem repeat and the g/c
polymorphism in the triple repeat in the promoter region of the
ts gene and of the c677t polymorphism of the  xxxg1475xxx  gene
was performed. none of the ts or  xxxg1475xxx  genotypes were associated with histopathological response and only the ts tandem
repeat polymorphism was signiﬁcantly related to survival (all
patients n 5 135, p 5 0.002; r0 resected patients n 5 102, p 5
0.007; log-rank test). multivariate analysis revealed ypn (p <
0.001) and the ts tandem repeat polymorphism as independent
prognostic factors in the ctx-r0-group (p 5 0.003). analyzing
the prognostic signiﬁcance of the ts polymorphisms in the r0group without ctx, ts genotypes were not signiﬁcantly associated with survival. comparing survival between r0 patients
with and without ctx in the respective ts genotype groups of
the tandem repeat polymorphism, a signiﬁcant survival beneﬁt
for the patients with ctx was found for the 2rpt/2rpt (n 5 49;
p 5 0.002) and 2rpt/3rpt genotypes (n 5 99; p 5 0.004), but not
for the 3rpt/3rpt genotype (n 5 57; p 5 0.93). patients’ survival
after ctx was associated with the ts tandem repeat polymorphism. ctx did not improve survival of patients with the 3rpt/
3rpt genotype. thus, a different therapy might be more appropriate for these patients.

neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer has been
used in several clinical trials. however, only 30–40% of patients
respond and the majority undergoes several months of toxic, expensive therapy without a survival beneﬁt.1–3 response to chemotherapy is considered to be highly complex and may be inﬂuenced
by speciﬁc genetic alterations in the tumors as well as by inherited
interindividual variability in genes involved in drug metabolism.
presently, there is no reliable assay that can be used to predict
chemotherapy response in gastric carcinoma in clinical practice.
thus, the identiﬁcation of molecular genetic parameters that are
associated with response and prognosis is of utmost interest.
most chemotherapeutic regimens used in the neoadjuvant treatment of advanced gastric carcinoma contain 5-fu. 5-fu is an inhibitor of  xxxg2366xxx  (ts), a key enzyme in nucleotide
metabolism. the promoter enhancer region of the ts gene contains polymorphic 28 base pair tandems repeats, and the presence
of the triple repeat (3rpt) has been shown to be associated with a
2-4 fold increase in protein expression in comparison to the double
repeat (2rpt).4,5 in addition, a g > c polymorphism in the second
repeat of the 3r allele has been demonstrated to alter the tranpublication of the international union against cancer

scriptional activity of the ts gene.6,7 because of this functional
relevance, these polymorphisms have been studied for response
prediction in various 5-fu based chemotherapeutic settings in different tumor types, but the results have been inconsistent.8–15
5,10- xxxg1475xxx  ( xxxg1475xxx ) is a key
regulatory enzyme in folate metabolism, which converts 5,10methylentetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. as 5,10methylentetrahydrofolate also serves as a substrate for the conversion of dump to  xxxd3365xxx , which is catalyzed by ts,  xxxg1475xxx  and
ts activity are interconnected and dependent on one another. a
common c677t polymorphism in the  xxxg1475xxx  gene leads to a
substitution of alanine by valine at codon 226 (ala226val). the
enzyme encoded by the 677tt genotype has been demonstrated to
have only 30% activity compared to the protein encoded by the
677cc genotype.16 in metastatic colorectal cancer treated with
ﬂuoropyrimidines, a signiﬁcant correlation has been reported between the presence of at least one t allele and response.17 to the
best of our knowledge, no data are available concerning a possible
association between ts or  xxxg1475xxx  polymorphisms with clinical
outcome in preoperative chemotherapy of gastric carcinoma.
the goal of our study was to analyze the polymorphisms of the
promoter region of the ts gene and the c677t polymorphism in
the  xxxg1475xxx  gene in order to test the hypothesis that they might be
used as predictive and prognostic markers for neoadjuvant chemotherapy of advanced gastric carcinoma. as the tandem repeat polymorphism of the ts gene revealed a prognostic relevance, we
compared the results regarding this gene to a group of patients
with locally advanced completely resected gastric cancer without
neoadjuvant treatment.

apy in 192 patients with locally advanced gastric carcinomas
(ct3-4, any n, m0) from october 1991 to january 2003.2,18 dna
of 135 patients (70%) receiving more than 50% of the projected
dose of chemotherapy was available. the clinical and histopathological data of the 135 patients that were included did not differ
from those of the entire group of 192 patients. patients older than
70 years and patients with bleeding of the primary tumor or gastric
outlet syndrome were excluded from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
eligibility requirements and staging procedures were as previously
described.19 as control group, 103 completely resected patients
staged ct3-4, any n, cm0, by endoscopy, endoluminal ultrasound
and ct scan undergoing primary surgery after the exclusion of peritoneal carcinomatosis by a diagnostic laparoscopy from february
1995 to october 2002, were included. all patients had to be ﬁt for
extended surgery. the clinical and histopathological data are included in table i.
the protocol was reviewed and approved by the local ethic
committee, and informed consent was obtained according to institutional regulations.

preoperative chemotherapy
the preoperative chemotherapy protocol consisted of 50 mg/m2
body surface area (bsa) cisplatin over 1 hr at weeks 1, 3 and 5,
500 mg/m2 bsa  xxxd2462xxx  for 2 hr, followed by 2000 mg/m2
bsa 5-fu given as continuous infusion over 24 hr at weeks 1, 2,
3, 4, 5 and 6 in 121 patients. additionally, paclitaxel 85 mg/m2
bsa at weeks 1,3,5 was given in 4 patients,  xxxd2008xxx  30 mg/m2
bsa at weeks 2,4,6 was given in 10 patients.
surgery, histopathology and response evaluation
in patients with proximal gastric cancer, a transhiatally
extended gastrectomy and an extended d2-lymphadenectomy
(resection of the lymph node groups 1 and 2 according to the japanese research society for gastric cancer), including a left retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy were performed; for patients with
the tumor localization in the middle or distal third, a total gastrectomy with d2-lymphadenctomy was performed.
histopathological workup was done by standardized protocols
including the ptnm-categories, resection margins (no microscopically residual tumor: r0; microscopically residual tumor:
r1; macroscopically residual tumor: r2), grading, tumor localization and lauren subtype. complete tumor resection (r0 resection)
in this study was deﬁned according to the histopathological work
up and not according to the surgeon.
response evaluation was performed histopathologically and clinically as previously described.19–22 for histopathological response
evaluation, the macroscopically identiﬁable tumor bed of the
resected tumors was completely examined histologically. for the
purpose of this study, all patients with less than 10% residual tumor
cells were classiﬁed as responders. all other patients were classiﬁed
as nonresponders.20 patients were also classiﬁed as nonresponding
when tumor progression occurred during chemotherapy.19
patient followup
after resection, patients were followed for a period of 3-month
interval, by abdominal and chest computed tomography (ct) and
endoscopy. tumor-related survival was calculated from the ﬁrst
day of chemotherapy or from the day of resection in patients with
primary operation. no patient was lost to follow up.
dna isolation
dna isolation from blood lymphocytes was performed after
cell lysis, proteinase k digestion followed by phenol and chloroform extraction according to standard procedures or by using a
dna extraction kit (qiagen, hilden, germany), according to
the manufacturers’ instructions. dna from formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded nontumorous tissues was isolated as previously
described.23
genotyping
pcr of the polymorphic region in the promoter of the ts gene
was performed using published primer sequences.9 the pcr reactions were run in 25 ll of a reaction mixture consisting of 10 mm
tris-hcl (ph 8.3), 50 mm kcl, 1.0 mm mgcl2, 0.01% gelatin,
200 lm dntp and 0.4 lm of each primer. after an initial denaturation step at 94°c for 4 min., 35–40 cycles were performed consisting of 30 sec at 64°c and 30 sec at 72°c, followed by a ﬁnal
extension of 7 min at 72°c. the triple repeat (3r) of the promoter
region resulted in a 144 bp and the double repeat (2r) in a 116 bp
fragment, which were separated and visualized by electrophoresis
on a 2% agarose gel. the g > c polymorphism within the triple
repeat was determined by rlfp analysis, using haeiii digestion
as published.24 patients with the ts 2rpt/2rpt, 2rpt/3c, 3c/3c genotypes were classiﬁed as low ts producers and patients with the
3g/3g, 3g/3c, 2rpt/3g genotypes were classiﬁed as high ts producers as described.13,24
genotyping of the c677t  xxxg1475xxx  polymorphism was performed by allelic discrimination using the 50 nuclease pcr assay

 xxxg2366xxx  polymorphism, therapy and prognosis

(taqman). primers and probes for the taqman assay were
designed using primer express software (pe applied biosystems).
primer sequences were as follows: forward, ggctgacctgaagcacttgaa; reverse, aaagaaaagctgcgtgatgatg. probes for the c or t allele
were 50 labelled with either fam or vic ﬂuorogenic dyes. the
sequences were c-allele, tgcgggagccgatt; t-allele, tgcgggagtcgattt. pcr ampliﬁcation was performed in 15 ll containing 1.8 ll
dna, 13 taqman universal master mix (pe applied biosystems), 200 nm for the probe of the c or t allele, respectively, and
900nm each primer. cycle conditions were 15 sec at 92°c and 1
min at 60°c for 40 cycles after an initial incubation of 2 min at
50°c and 10 min at 95°c. assays were run in duplicates.
for quality control, at least 20 samples were analyzed twice or
analyzed in parallel by direct sequencing giving consistent results
in all cases. dna sequencing was performed by cycle sequencing
with ﬂuorescent labeled dye terminators and separation with an automated sequencing system (abi 377, perkin-elmer, branchburg,
new jersey).
statistical analysis
association between the different genotypes and clinical and
histopathological features were analyzed by v2-, kruskal-wallis
or fisher’s exact test where appropriate. survival rates were estimated according to kaplan-meier. comparisons between different
groups of patients were performed with the log-rank test. relative
risks were estimated by calculating hazard ratios (hr) from cox
proportional hazard models. prognostic signiﬁcance of potential
parameters was determined by univariate and multivariate analysis. all statistical testing was two-sided and conducted at the 0.05
signiﬁcance level. spss software (spss inc., chicago, il 11.5)
was used.

2887

in the control group of patients without preoperative chemotherapy (n 5 103), 22 (21%) patients showed the 2rpt/2rpt genotype, 53 (52%) the 2rpt/3rpt genotype and 28 (27%) the 3rpt/3rpt
genotype of the ts length polymorphism. for 101 patients, genotpying of the g/c polymorphism in the triple repeat was successful: 63 (62%) patients were low and 38 (38%) were high ts producers. regarding the ts genotypes, either considering the tandem repeat polymorphism alone or using the classiﬁcation of a
low and high ts producing genotype, no statistical difference for
the ts genotype distributions could be found between r0
resected patients with and without neoadjuvant treatment (p 5
0.60 and p 5 0.77).
genotypes and response
for the ts tandem repeat polymorphism, there was no association with response. among the 33 responding patients, 7 (21%)
demonstrated the 2rpt/2rpt genotype, 16 (49%) the 2rpt/3rpt genotype and 10 (30%) the 3rpt/3rpt genotype; and among the 102 nonresponding patients, 26 (26%) had the 2rpt/2rpt, 45 (44%) had the
2rpt/3rpt and 31 (30%) the 3rpt/3rpt genotype (p 5 0.86) (fig. 1a).
the classiﬁcation in high and low ts producing genotypes showed
no association with response as well. among the 33 responding
patients, 14 (42%) demonstrated the high and 19 (58%) the low ts
producing genotype and among the 101 evaluable nonresponding
patients, 37 (37%) demonstrated the high and 64 (63%) the low ts
producing genotype (p 5 0.68).

results
patients, treatment and followup
hundred and thirty-ﬁve patients who had received preoperative
chemotherapy were included in the study. 129 (96%) patients
could be resected, 102 (79%) patients received complete (r0)
resections. there were 33 responders and 102 nonresponders. the
mean followup for the surviving patients was 38.1 months (range
4.8–112.3). the median overall survival was 77.8 months.
in the control group of 103 completely resected patients without
preoperative chemotherapy, the mean follow up for the surviving
patients was 45.1 months (range 0.4–112.1) and the median survival was 33.8 months.
there was no signiﬁcant differences with respect to histopathological classiﬁcation and tumor grading between the patients
treated with and without neoadjuvant chemotherapy. with respect
to tumor localization and age of the patients, a signiﬁcant preponderance of distally located tumors (p < 0.001) and of patients with
older age (p < 0.001) were observed in the group without neoadjuvant chemotherapy. therefore, we tested the ts polymorphisms
with respect to age and tumor localization without any signiﬁcant
association (all p-values > 0.05).
the patient characteristics are summarized in table i.
allele frequencies
in the group of patients with preoperative chemotherapy, 33
(25%) patients showed the 2rpt/2rpt genotype, 61 (45%) the 2rpt/
3rpt genotype and 41 (30%) the 3rpt/3rpt genotype of the ts tandem repeat polymorphism. inclusion of the g/c polymorphism in
the triple repeat in our analysis and classiﬁcation of the patients in
ts high producers (3g/3g, 3g/3c, 2rpt/3g) and ts low producers (2rpt/2rpt, 2rpt/3c, 3c/3c), 83 (62%) were low and 51
(38%) were high producers. one patient could not be evaluated
for the g/c polymorphism. with respect to the  xxxg1475xxx  gene, 50
(37%) of the patients had the cc genotype, 71 (53%) the ct
genotype and 14 (10%) the tt genotype.

all patients of the ctx group. in the neoadjuvant treated
group, considering the ts tandem repeat polymorphism, the three

different ts genotypes demonstrated a statistically signiﬁcant
association with tumor related survival (p 5 0.002) (fig. 2). in this
group, a strong statistically signiﬁcant survival difference was
found between responding and nonresponding patients (p 5
0.0001) (fig. 3a). considering the survival of the responding and
nonresponding patients in the respective ts genotype groups,

2890

ott et al.

there was a strong, statistically signiﬁcant survival difference for
the patients with 2rpt/3rpt genotype (p 5 0.0007). all of the 16
responding patients with the 2rpt/3rpt genotype were still alive
(fig. 3b). in contrast, the responding and nonresponding patients
with the 2rpt/2rpt genotype showed no statistically signiﬁcant survival difference (p 5 0.11) (fig. 3c). similarly, patients homozygous for the triple repeat (3rpt/3rpt) showed only a trend for an
improved survival in responders (p 5 0.08) (fig. 3d). of note, the
survival rate of the responders with the 3rpt/3rpt genotype was
almost identical to the survival rate of the nonresponders with the
2rpt/2rpt genotype (figs. 3c and 3d).
no association with survival was found using the classiﬁcation
of the ts genotypes in high and low ts producers (p 5 0.70).
the  xxxg1475xxx  polymorphism was not signiﬁcantly related to survival (p 5 0.14) (fig. 2b). the relative risks for the different genotypes of the ts and  xxxg1475xxx  genes are shown in table ii.
cox regression analysis for the neoadjuvant treated patients
(n 5 135) including response to chemotherapy, genotype of the ts
tandem repeat polymorphism, ypt category, ypn category and r
category revealed ypn and the ts polymorphism and r category
as prognostic factors in the stepwise analysis (table iii).

completely resected (r0) patients of the ctx group. among
the 102 neoadjuvant treated completely resected patients, the association of the ts tandem repeat polymorphism genotype and
patient survival remained signiﬁcant (p 5 0.007). the median survival for patients with the 3rpt/3rpt genotype was 31.3 months
(range: 2.2–106.7), whereas the median survival for the two other
genotypes was not reached yet. classiﬁcation of the patients in
high and low ts producers revealed a trend for an association of
patients with the low producing genotpyes and better survival (p
5 0.08). the median survival of the patients with high producing
genotypes was 36.0 months, the median survival of the patients
with the low producing genotypes was not reached yet.
the  xxxg1475xxx  genotype had no prognostic impact in neoadjuvant
treated completely resected patients (p 5 0.23).
the stepwise cox regression analysis including the all signiﬁcant prognostic factors of the univariate analysis (response, ypt,
ypn and ts tandem repeat polymorphism) revealed ypn and ts
length polymorphism as independent prognostic factors for the
completely resected patients (table iii).
completely resected (r0) patients without ctx. in the control
group of the completely resected patients without chemotherapy,
there was no signiﬁcant survival difference between the patients in
relation to the ts genotypes regarding the tandem repeat polymorphism (p 5 0.83) (fig. 4). grouping the patients into high and low
ts producers demonstrated a trend for an association of patients
with the low producing genotpyes and better survival (p 5 0.09).
the median survival of the patients with high producing genotypes was 25.8 months; the median survival of the patients with
the low producing genotypes was 61.9 months. the relative risks
of the various ts genotypes are included in table ii. multivariate
analysis identiﬁed pn-category (p 5 0.001) and pt-category (p 5
0.047) as the only signiﬁcant prognostic factors.
analyzing the survival difference for completely resected

this study is, to the best of our knowledge, the ﬁrst and largest
study analyzing the inﬂuence of polymorphisms in the promoter
enhancer region of the ts gene and of the c677t polymorphism
in the  xxxg1475xxx  gene, on the responsiveness to continous 5-fu
based chemotherapy and patient survival in neoadjuvant treated
gastric cancer. the most important observation in this study indicates a major impact of the genotype of the ts tandem repeat
polymorphism on patient survival only in the setting of neoadju-

vant chemotherapy. in addition, comparison of survival between
completely resected patients with or without neoadjuvant treatment indicated that neoadjuvant chemotherapy did not improve
survival in patients with the 3rpt/3rpt genotype.
the distribution of the ts genotypes of the tandem repeat and
the g/c polymorphism in the triple repeat corresponds well to the
data of gastric and colorectal cancer patients in western countries, to an australian and to a white control population.7–10,14,25
in the neoadjuvant setting, patients homozygous for the triple
repeat of the ts polymorphism showed a statistically signiﬁcant
worse prognosis in our study. noticeably, however, the proportion of responders and nonresponders was similar among the different genotypes, indicating that the ts genotype is not related to
response at least in terms of the established criteria for response
evaluation, which were used in our study. patients who were heterozygous for the ts tandem repeat polymorphism showed the
strongest survival difference between responding and nonresponding patients. on the other hand, responding patients homozygous for the double or triple repeat had a tendency toward better
survival, but the differences were not statistically signiﬁcant. this
indicates that in the heterozygote group, response to chemotherapy may exert the strongest ability to improve survival. although
135 patients with chemotherapy have been included in this study,
the respective subgroups with the various genotypes are different
in size, which can affect statistical power. interestingly, however,
there was nearly no difference between survival rates between
responders with the 3rpt/3rpt genotype and nonresponders with
the 2rpt/2rpt genotype.
our ﬁnding of an association of the ts tandem repeat polymorphism with survival, but not with histopathological response in the
neoadjuvant treated group, may point to response mechanisms on
the molecular or cellular basis, which do not necessarily translate
into a measurable tumor shrinkage and are not revealed by standardized response evaluation methods. response evaluation in our
study was essentially based on histopathological methods. analyzing the ts length polymorphism with respect to clinical response
rates, determined by endoscopy, ct and endoscopic ultrasound,

gave essentially the same results (data not shown), which conﬁrms
our overall ﬁndings. although histopathological and clinical
response evaluation methods are highly associated with survival
in our as well as in previous studies,1,2 it has to be emphasized that
the accuracy of response evaluation is not perfect. it has been suggested, that despite being accepted as a valid measure of antitumor
activity, reponse rates do not capture the full effect of treatment
beneﬁt and that patients with nonresponding tumors, but demonstrating an increase in survival may beneﬁt from delay in tumor
progression.26 the exact mechanism by which the ts genotypes
affect survival and response in neoadjuvant treated gastric cancer
must be highly complex and is not known in detail. as we did not
ﬁnd any association of the ts tandem repeat polymorphism with
survival in the untreated group of patients, the prognostic value of
this ts polymorphism in the neoadjuvant treated patients seems to
be chemotherapy dependent without being measurable by the
response evaluation methods used in our study.
in the untreated control group of patients, the preponderance of
distally located tumors and of patients with older age may be
related to the inclusion criteria used for neoadjuvant treatment,
which encompasses age younger than 70 years and exclusion of
patients with gastric outlet stenosis. because of the older age of
patients in the control group, direct comparison of the results
might be hampered by age related comorbidity. indeed, we found
an improved survival for younger patients (< 70 years) compared
to older patients in this group (p 5 0.02) (data not shown). however, analysing the ts tandem repeat polymorphism with survival
separately in both age groups, we found essentially the same
results, revealing no association of this polymorphism with survival (p 5 0.44, < 70 years; p 5 0.99, > 70 years). in addition,
our results that the ts genotypes demonstrated no association with
either age or tumor localization makes a bias of the overall results
because of this differences unlikely.
as patients with the 3rpt/3rpt genotype treated with neoadjuvant
chemotherapy did not demonstrate a survival beneﬁt in comparison to untreated patients, a different chemotherapy or primary
resection should be discussed for this group of patients.

other studies in gastric cancer revealed only a weak association
for the combined 2rpt/2rpt and 2rpt/3rpt genotypes with prolonged
survival in a study of 51 patients treated with a 5-fu based postoperative chemotherapy.27 however, it has to be emphasized that in
this study, genotyping was performed from tumor dna, which
may lead to a false positive classiﬁcation of homozygosity in the
case of constitutional heterozygosity and concomitant loss of one
allele in the tumor. kawakami analyzed the ts genotypes including
a g/c single nucleotide polymorphism within the repeat polymorphism in the promoter region and a 6-bp deletion polymorphism in
the 30 untranslated region of the gene, for an association with dis-

ease free survival in gastric cancer patients treated with ﬂuorouracilbased adjuvant chemotherapy and found a signiﬁcant better outcome for carriers of low ts expression genotypes.13 in another
study, in gastric cancer treated with 5-fu/cisplatin in the palliative
setting, patients with a favorable ts genotype demonstrated a trend
for an increased survival, but did not show an association with
response.14 the ﬁndings of these studies are essentially in line with
our results in the neoadjuvant setting. however, in our study, the
division in only two groups with high and low ts producing
patients did not lead to a better prediction of response or prognosis.
in contrast, no statistically signiﬁcant difference in survival could

 xxxg2366xxx  polymorphism, therapy and prognosis

be found any more. if only the patients with the 2rpt/3rpt genotype
were divided into low and high producers and the 2rpt/2rpt were
deﬁned as low and the 3rpt/3rpt as high producers, the results
remained statistically signiﬁcant (p 5 0.009). thus, the effect of
the ts polymorphisms on survival seems to be primarily associated
with the ts tandem repeat polymorphism in our study.
regarding the  xxxg1475xxx  polymorphism, there was neither a statistically signiﬁcant association with response nor with prognosis
in our study. however, in contrast, to what was expected, the tt
genotype showed a trend for an association with nonresponse,
with a similar genotype distribution in the whole study, as reported
by others.28,29 patients with this genotype showed a better survival
rate. however, in light of the relatively small number of patients
with the tt genotype, interpretation of this ﬁnding has to be taken
with care and needs to be analyzed in a higher number of patients.
for colorectal cancer, a statistically signiﬁcant correlation of the t
allele with response was found,17 but no survival difference was
shown between patients with the wild type cc genotype and
patients with at least one t allele by others.30
because all patients received more than 50% of the projected
dose of chemotherapy and none of the included patients developed
severe toxicity during the second cycle of chemotherapy, this
study was not suitable to analyze an association between the tested
polymorphisms and toxicity.
despite the relatively homogenous group of 135 patients with
locally advanced gastric cancer in our study, the study has to be

2893

considered as exploratory and its retrospective nature clearly precludes immediate use of ts and  xxxg1475xxx  genotyping in clinical
practice. further, large-scale, prospective studies will be needed to
conﬁrm and extend our ﬁndings.
the fact that dna of only 70% of all patients included in phase
ii studies was available for analysis in our study, and the long median survival time of 77.8 months must also be taken into consideration. the long median survival might be due to a preferential
collection of dna from blood samples from surviving patients
from the early years of the phase ii studies. to exclude a bias, the
correlation of the genotypes with survival was repeated for 87
patients treated from the beginning of 1999 and having a median
survival of 37 months, which corresponds to a total of 97%
patients treated during that time. essentially, the same results for
an association of the ts genotype of the tandem repeat polymorphism with survival were obtained for all patients (p 5 0.01) and
for the 70 completely resected patients (p 5 0.003). this indicates
that a bias due to a preferential inclusion of long surviving patients
is unlikely.
in conclusion, our study demonstrates for the ﬁrst time in
locally advanced gastric cancer that the constitutional ts tandem
repeat polymorphism has a strong inﬂuence on the prognosis of
patients treated preoperatively with continous infusional 5-fu.
this observation and other genetic variants inﬂuencing patient’s
prognosis and response could substantially contribute to the future
design of individualized cancer treatment.
