purpose. to determine the role of prostanoid ep receptors in
the intraocular pressure (iop)–lowering effect of prostaglandin
analogues in ep receptor– deficient mice.
methods. animals were bred and acclimatized in a 12-hour
light– dark cycle. the diurnal iop variation was measured by a
microneedle method in ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , and  xxxg1874xxx – deficient
mice (ep1ko, ep2ko and ep3ko) and in their wild-type (wt)
background strain. iop was measured in each mouse at night 3
hours after application of  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx  (0.004%),
 xxxd340xxx  (0.03%), or unoprostone (0.12%). in wt and
ep3ko mice, the effects of preapplication of diclofenac na on
drug-induced iop reduction were examined.
results. baseline iops were the same for all strains. higher
baseline iops were observed at night. maximum iop reduction
occurred in wt mice 3 hours after  xxxd2446xxx  application
during the day and night. three hours after instillation at night,
each of the four drugs lowered iop significantly in wt,
ep1ko, and ep2ko mice, whereas ep3ko a significantly lesser
effect was induced by  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx , and  xxxd340xxx . preapplication of diclofenac na significantly attenuated
drug-induced iop reduction in wt but not in ep3ko mice.
conclusions. deficiency of ep receptors had no effect on physiological iop. ep1 and  xxxg1873xxx  receptors are not involved in prostaglandin analogue–induced iop reduction, whereas ep3 receptors may play a role. (invest ophthalmol vis sci. 2006;47:

rostaglandin analogues (pg analogues) have been widely
used as ocular hypotensive drugs for the treatment of
glaucoma and ocular hypertension, because they have a greater
effect on lowering intraocular pressure (iop) and fewer systemic side effects than do ␤-blockers.1–3 currently, four different types of pg analogues ( xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx ,  xxxd340xxx , and isopropyl unoprostone [unoprostone]) are for the
treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension.  xxxd2446xxx 
and  xxxd3414xxx  are thought to lower iop mainly via the fp
receptor,4,5 and there is evidence that  xxxd340xxx  and unoprostone also lower iop through this receptor.5
it has been reported that the active forms of  xxxd2446xxx  and
unoprostone facilitate release of pge2 and that this effect can
be inhibited by indomethacin.6,7 kashiwagi and tsukahara.8

reported that coadministration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) inhibits  xxxd2446xxx -induced iop reduction
in normal volunteers. kaplan-messas et al.9 indicated that cholinergic and adrenergic drug-induced endogenous pge2 production in the iris-ciliary body may have a role in the hypotensive effect of adrenergic and cholinergic drugs.9 these reports
suggest that not only the administered drug but also pg produces endogenously after drug application and non-fp prostanoid receptors may contribute to pg analogue–induced reduction of iop.
one of the prostanoid receptors possibly influencing iop is
the ep receptor, which consists of four subtypes: ep1,  xxxg1873xxx ,
ep3, and  xxxg1875xxx . pge2 induces ocular inflammation in cats and
rabbits.10 –13 recently, it has been reported that topically applied 8-iso-pge2, which acts on prostanoid ep and tp receptors,14 –16 lowers iop in normal and glaucomatous monkey
eyes in a different way than  xxxd2446xxx .17–20 selective ep1
(17-phenyl trinor pge2),21 and  xxxg1873xxx  (ah13205)22 and relatively
selective ep3 (sulprostone)23 receptor agonists lower iop in
cats, monkeys, and rabbits, respectively. prostanoid ep receptors are reportedly concerned with relaxation of the trabecular
meshwork and ciliary muscle24 and degradation of extracellular matrix around ciliary smooth muscle cells.25–27 these previous studies strongly suggest the involvement of prostanoid
ep receptors in the regulation of iop. however, the contribution of prostanoid ep receptors to the iop-lowering effect of
clinically used pg analogues and to physiological iop regulation has not been addressed. in this work, we studied the effect
of prostanoid ep-receptor deficiency on the diurnal variation of
iop and on pg analogue-induced iop reduction, in prostanoid
ep1-,  xxxg1873xxx -, and ep3-knockout mice, of which the wild-type
(wt) has an ocular distribution of prostanoid ep receptors
similar to humans.28

and

methods

animals
all experiments were performed in compliance with the arvo statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research. mice
(c57bl/6) were purchased from japan slc (hamamatsu, japan) at 5
weeks of age. the mouse genes encoding ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , or ep3 receptors
were disrupted by gene knockout methods using homologous recombination, as reported previously,29,30 and ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , or ep3 homozygous
knockout (ep1ko, ep2ko, and ep3ko, respectively) mice were produced. c57bl/6 mice, which are the background species of the knockout mice, were used as the wt control. mice were bred and housed in
clear cages covered loosely with air filters. the cages contained white
chip bedding. the environment was kept at 21°c with a 12-hour light
(0600 –1800 hours) and a 12-hour dark cycle. all mice were fed ad
libitum and were acclimatized to the environment for at least 2 weeks
before experiments. in all experiments, we used mice older than 8
weeks.

preparation and instillation of
ophthalmic solution
 xxxd2446xxx  and  xxxd340xxx  were purchased from cayman chemical
co. (ann arbor, mi).  xxxd2446xxx  (0.005%) was dissolved in its vehicle

solution, as reported previously.31  xxxd340xxx  (0.03%) was dissolved
in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs).  xxxd3414xxx  (0.004%) and unoprostone (0.12%) ophthalmic solutions and vehicle solution for each were
provided by alcon, inc. (fort worth, tx) and r-tech ueno, ltd.
(hyogo, japan), respectively. diclofenac na was purchased from sigma-aldrich japan (tokyo, japan) and dissolved in pbs at a concentration of 0.1%. with a micropipette, 3 ␮l of each drug solution was
applied topically to a randomly selected eye in a masked manner,
whereas the other eye remained untreated to serve as the control.

effect of diclofenac na on pg analogue–induced
iop reduction in wt mice
diclofenac na (3 ␮l, 0.1%) or pbs was applied topically 30 minutes
before the application of pg analogues in wt and ep3ko mice. each
pg analogue was applied at 1800 hours and iop measurement was
made 3 hours after the pg analogue application. the effect of diclofenac na on baseline iop in wt mice was examined in the same way as
a control.

statistical analysis

iop measurement
iop was measured by a microneedle method in mice anesthetized with
ketamine and xylazine, as described previously.32,33 briefly, a microneedle made of borosilicate glass (100-␮m tip diameter and 1.0-mm
outer diameter, world precision instruments [wpi], sarasota, fl) was
connected to a pressure transducer (model blpr; wpi). the system
pressure detected by the transducer was recorded by a data acquisition
and analysis system (powerlab; adinstruments, colorado springs,
co). the microneedle was placed in the anterior chamber and the
conducted pressure was recorded in both eyes during a 4- to 7-minute
time window after anesthesia. until the mouse was placed on the table
for iop measurement, room lighting was maintained similar to that in
the vivarium. during the dark phase, all procedures were performed
under red light illumination to eliminate the effect of lighting on iop.
the effect of each drug in each mouse was calculated as the ratio of
iop reduction (%), defined as 100 ⫻ (iop of treated eye ⫺ iop of
contralateral untreated eye)/iop of contralateral untreated eye.

diurnal variation of iop in the mouse strains and
effect of  xxxd2446xxx  on iop in wt mice
diurnal iop variation in mice under general anesthesia was measured
during the day (0900 hours) and at night (2100 hours) by the microneedle method. the time points of iop measurement were determined according to previous reports where trough and peak iop under
the 12 hour light– dark cycle were observed at 0900 and 2100 hours in
nih swiss34 and ddy mice.33
to determine the best time for demonstrating the ocular hypotensive effect of pg analogues, we measured the time course of  xxxd2446xxx ’s effect on iop in wt mice.  xxxd2446xxx  (3 ␮l, 0.005%) was
applied at 0600 or 1800 hours as described earlier, and the ioplowering effect was measured 1, 2, 3, and 6 hours after the instillation.
the time when the ocular hypotensive effect was greatest was used for
further studies to evaluate the effects of pg analogues.

iop-lowering effects of pg analogues on mice
at night
three microliters of  xxxd2446xxx  (0.005%),  xxxd3414xxx  (0.004%),  xxxd340xxx  (0.03%) or unoprostone (0.12%) was applied topically at 1800
hours. three investigators instilled eye drops without knowing what
was administered or what the other two investigators had administered. a fourth investigator, masked to the treatment, measured iop 3
hours after drug instillation. thus, all measurements were performed
under masked conditions.

the wilcoxon signed-rank or rank-sum test was used as appropriate.
the kruskal-wallis test was used for multiple comparison of baseline
iops. the steel and the steel-dwass tests were used for multiple
comparison of iop reduction. p ⬍ 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. all data are presented as the mean ⫾ sem.

results
diurnal variation of iop in wt, ep1ko, ep2ko,
and ep3ko mice
mean iops of wt, ep1ko, ep2ko, and ep3ko mice during the
day (at 0900 hours) and at night (2100 hours) are shown in
table 1. the iop observed at night in each genotype was
higher than that during the day; however, there was no significant difference between iops during the day and night among
the genotypes.

effect of  xxxd2446xxx  on wt mice during the day
and at night
the iop-lowering effect of  xxxd2446xxx  (0.005%) was examined
1, 2, 3, and 6 hours after instillation at 0600 (day) and 1800
(night; fig. 1) hours. during the day, significant iop reductions
were observed at 2 (10.5% ⫾ 5.0%; p ⫽ 0.0195) and 3 (12.9%
⫾ 1.7%; p ⫽ 0.0020) hours after the instillation. at night,
 xxxd2446xxx  significantly lowered iop at 1 (10.1% ⫾ 2.1%, p ⫽
0.0039), 2 (19.1% ⫾ 2.0%, p ⫽ 0.0020), 3 (20.0% ⫾ 1.5%, p ⫽
0.0020), and 6 (10.3% ⫾ 2.1%, p ⫽ 0.0039) hours after instillation. there was no significant difference in mean iops of
contralateral eyes among the four time points during the day
(p ⫽ 0.2768) and at night (p ⫽ 0.1396). the maximum reduction in iop was observed 3 hours after the instillation both
during the day and at night, and a stronger iop reduction was
observed at night (p ⫽ 0.0041– 0.0494, 1– 6 hours after instillation). therefore, comparison of the iop-lowering effects of
pg analogues in this study was performed 3 hours after the
instillation at night.

effect of pg analogues on iop at night
three hours after the treatment with vehicle solution for each
drug, the mean iop reductions at night ranged from ⫺3.0% to
2.1% in all strains.  xxxd2446xxx  (0.005%) significantly lowered
iop in wt (22.1% ⫾ 1.1%, p ⫽ 0.0039), ep1ko (18.6% ⫾ 1.6%,

the expression of prostanoid ep receptors in the eyes of
various animals and humans have been studied.28,35–39 in mice,
the expression of prostanoid ep1 (cornea, conjunctiva, trabecular meshwork, nonpigmented epithelium of ciliary body, and
retina),  xxxg1873xxx  (cornea, conjunctiva, trabecular meshwork, iris,
ciliary body, and retina), ep3 (nonpigmented epithelium of
ciliary body), and  xxxg1875xxx  (cornea, conjunctiva, trabecular meshwork, nonpigmented epithelium of ciliary body, and retina) are
similar to the distribution of ep receptors in humans.28 ep1–
 xxxg1875xxx  receptors are expressed in cornea, conjunctiva, trabecular
meshwork, iris, ciliary body, and retina in human eyes.37,40 – 42
the similarity of receptor distributions indicates that the
mouse is a suitable animal model for investigating the involvement of prostanoid ep receptors in drug effects, although in
this study, ep4ko mice could not be used, because the mutation is lethal for the embryo.43
we measured baseline iop at trough (0900 hours) and peak
(2100 hours) times in our previous studies.33,34 the results in
this study revealed that baseline iops in wt, ep1ko, ep2ko,
and ep3ko mice are the same and that baseline iop in each
genotype is higher at night than during the day (table 1),
which is consistent with our previous work.33,34 we conclude
that the physiology of aqueous humor dynamics in ep1ko,
ep2ko, and ep3ko mice is similar to that in wt mice under
normal conditions.
in wt, ep1ko, and ep2ko mice, all pg analogues used in
the study significantly lowered iop to a similar extent in each
genotype (fig. 2), whereas, in ep3ko mice,  xxxd2446xxx -,  xxxd3414xxx -, and  xxxd340xxx -induced iop reductions were significantly less than those in wt mice. although the acid forms of
 xxxd2446xxx  and  xxxd340xxx  have relatively high affinities for
the  xxxg1872xxx  (ec50 ⫽ 119 and 2.7 nm, respectively),44 the
iop reduction induced by  xxxd2446xxx  and  xxxd340xxx  in
ep1ko mice was the same as in wt mice. our previous study

effect of diclofenac na on pg analogue–induced
iop reduction in wt mice
to determine whether secondary pg production is involved
with drug-induced iop reduction in wt mice, we examined
the effect of pretreatment by instillation at night of diclofenac
na (0.1%), an nsaid (fig. 3). instillation of diclofenac na did
not affect iop in wt mice (p ⫽ 0.7969).  xxxd2446xxx  (21.2% ⫾
0.8%, p ⬍ 0.0001),  xxxd3414xxx  (24.7% ⫾ 1.4%, p ⬍ 0.0001),

mice. in wt mice, the iop reductions induced by  xxxd2446xxx

revealed that  xxxd2446xxx - and  xxxd340xxx -induced iop reductions were abolished in fpko mice after a single application,5
suggesting that  xxxd2446xxx  and  xxxd340xxx  do not lower iop
through action at the  xxxg1872xxx  at short times after a single
application. in ep2ko mice, all pg analogues lowered iop to
a similar extent compared with wt mice. affinities of the acid
forms of  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx ,  xxxd340xxx , and unoprostone for the  xxxg1873xxx  receptors are very low (ec50 ⬎ 10 ␮m),44
which is consistent with results in this study that a deficiency
of  xxxg1873xxx  receptors did not affect the iop-lowering efficacies of
the pg analogues.
 xxxd2446xxx  acid and  xxxd3414xxx  acid have low affinity for
the  xxxg1874xxx ,44 and  xxxd340xxx  has some affinity for the
 xxxg1874xxx .44 however, iop reduction induced by these pg
analogues was abolished in fpko mice.5 these results and our
finding of a reduced iop-lowering effect of these three drugs in
ep3ko mice do not support the hypothesis of direct stimulation of ep3 receptors by these pg analogues. a possible explanation is that there was an alteration of aqueous humor dynamics arising from histologic change in the anterior segment of
ep3ko mice. although it is possible that abnormalities in
ultrastructure and composition of extracellular matrix of the
anterior segment existed and that those abnormalities affected
aqueous humor dynamics, ep1ko, ep2ko, and ep3ko mice
had no significant tissue abnormalities in their paraffin-embedded and hematoxylin-eosin–stained sections of anterior segment observable with light microscopy (data not shown).
these observations do not support the explanation.
another explanation for our finding is that there was a
partial contribution of endogenous pgs, which were secondarily produced by the direct stimulation of the fp-receptor, to
 xxxg1874xxx  stimulation. to clarify whether endogenously
produced pgs play a role in the iop-lowering effect of pg
analogues currently used in mice, we examined the effect of
pretreatment with diclofenac na on pg analogue–induced iop
reduction in wt and ep3ko mice. diclofenac na significantly
attenuated drug-induced iop reduction only in wt mice (fig.
2). although unoprostone showed a trend in iop change similar to that of other pg analogues currently used, a substantially
weaker potential to reduce iop may result in the lack of power
to detect a small difference in iop reductions among strains. it
is reported that  xxxd2446xxx  and unoprostone induce endogenous pge2, which was inhibited by nsaids, and that the

iop-lowering effect of  xxxd2446xxx  was attenuated by coadministration of nsaids in normal volunteers and in rabbits.6,7,45
taken together, these results suggest that pg analogues in
current use induce endogenous pgs that lower iop through
the  xxxg1874xxx  in mice.
the ep3 and fp receptors have similar cellular distributions
in the trabecular meshwork and ciliary body.37 in our earlier5
and recent studies,46  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd340xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx , and
unoprostone showed no ocular hypotensive effect in fp-knockout mice. these data suggest that the stimulation of  xxxg1878xxx  may be primarily required for endogenously produced
pge2 and its  xxxg1874xxx –mediated iop-lowering effect.
costagliola et al.47 reported recently that diclofenac na significantly enhances the hypotensive effect of  xxxd2446xxx  in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. they hypothesized
that continuous inhibition of cox by repeated nsaid administration induces depression of endogenous pg synthesis followed by upregulation of prostanoid receptors in glaucomatous patients, and they suggested that pathophysiological
upregulation of prostanoid receptors is responsible for a more
marked iop reduction. in contrast, kashiwagi and tsukahara8
reported that coadministration of an nsaid inhibited  xxxd2446xxx -induced iop reduction in normal volunteers. the effects
of multiple applications of pg analogues, with or without
nsaids, on mouse iop have not been studied yet and should
be the subject of future studies. needless to say, it is difficult to
compare the current results with a single use of nsaid in
mouse eyes with the results in the human study. pgs secondarily produced after application of pg analogues should also be
identified chemically, and further studies using agonists and
antagonists specific for ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3, and  xxxg1875xxx  receptor each
would provide more information on ep receptor–mediated
mechanisms of iop reduction.
in conclusion, the prostanoid ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , and ep3 receptors
do not affect diurnal iop variation and structure of the anterior
segment of the mouse eye. ep1 and  xxxg1873xxx  receptors do not
contribute significantly to pg analogue–induced iop reduction. finally, endogenous pgs produced by fp-receptor stimulation are partly involved in the iop reduction after a single
application of clinically used fp agonists in mice, and this
effect is mediated via ep3 receptors.
