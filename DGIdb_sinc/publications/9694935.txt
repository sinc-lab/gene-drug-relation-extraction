the antipsychotic agent  xxxd3195xxx  is a high affinity antagonist of the human cardiac  xxxg1232xxx   xxxg1246xxx .  acquired long qt syndrome is a side effect seen with some pharmacological agents, including antipsychotic drugs, and is associated with the development of ventricular arrhythmias. this syndrome is often caused by the blockade of repolarizing potassium channels the human heart. a new antipsychotic agent,  xxxd3195xxx , has been shown to produce qt prolongation after therapeutic doses in humans. we therefore examined the effects of  xxxd3195xxx  on two cloned human cardiac potassium channels, the human ether-a-go-go-related gene ( xxxg1246xxx ) and  xxxg1234xxx , stably transfected into mammalian cell lines. using patch clamp electrophysiology, we found  xxxd3195xxx  blocked  xxxg1246xxx  currents with an ic50 value of 14.0 nm when tail currents at -40 mv were measured after a 2-sec depolarization to +20 mv. when currents were measured at the end of prolonged (20 sec) depolarizing pulses, the ic50 of  xxxd3195xxx  measured 2.99 nm.  xxxd3195xxx  enhanced the rate of current decay during these prolonged voltage steps and displayed a positive voltage dependence.  xxxd3195xxx  was approximately 1000-fold less active at blocking  xxxg1234xxx  displaying an ic50 value of 2.12 microm. by comparison, the potent class iii antiarrhythmic agent dofetilde blocked  xxxg1246xxx  with an ic50 value of 9.50 nm but did not enhance  xxxg1246xxx  current decay or block kv1. 5 channel currents. it is concluded that  xxxd3195xxx  is a high affinity antagonist of the human cardiac  xxxg1232xxx   xxxg1246xxx  and that this blockade underlies the prolongation of qt interval observed with this drug. furthermore, the  xxxd3195xxx  molecule may provide a useful starting point for the development of very high affinity ligands for  xxxg1246xxx .
