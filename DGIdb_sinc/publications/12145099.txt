1 atp-sensitive k+ channels are composed of pore-forming subunits  xxxg1250xxx  and of sulphonylurea
receptors (surs); the latter are the target of the hypoglycaemic sulphonylureas like  xxxd2215xxx .
here, we report on the negative allosteric modulation by mgatp and mgadp of  xxxd2215xxx 
binding to  xxxg19xxx  and to  xxxg20xxx  mutants with high  xxxd2215xxx  anity, sur2a(y1206s) and
sur2b(y1206s).
2 atp, in the presence of an atp-regenerating system to oppose hydrolysis during incubation,
inhibited  xxxd2215xxx  binding to  xxxg19xxx  and sur2b(y1206s) by *60%, to sur2a(y1206s) by
21%). inhibition curves for the  xxxg20xxx (y1206s) isoforms were monophasic with ic50 values of 5 ±
10 mm; the curve for  xxxg19xxx  was biphasic (ic50 values 4.7 and 1300 mm).
3  xxxd2215xxx  inhibition curves for adp, performed in the presence of an atp-consuming
system to oppose atp formation from adp, were generally shifted rightwards and showed positive
cooperativity, in particular with the  xxxg20xxx (y1206s) isoforms.
4 in the absence of the coupled enzyme systems, inhibition curves of mgatp or mgadp were
generally shifted leftwards. this indicated synergy of mgatp and mgatp in acting together.
5 coexpression of  xxxg19xxx  and sur2b(y1206s) with  xxxg1250xxx  reduced both potency and ecacy of
atp in inhibiting  xxxd2215xxx  binding; this was particularly marked for  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx .
6 the data show (a) that the inhibitory eects of atp and adp on  xxxd2215xxx  binding dier
from one another, (b) that they depend on the sur subtype, and (c) that they are weakened by
coexpression with  xxxg1250xxx .

introduction
sulphonylureas like  xxxd2215xxx  stimulate insulin secretion
and are used as treatment in type-2 diabetes (groop &
neugebauer, 1996). at higher concentrations  xxxd2215xxx 
shows eects also in the ischaemic heart, where it blocks the
ischaemia-induced narrowing of the cardiac action potential
(fosset et al., 1988) and the dilatation of the coronary
vascular bed (daut et al., 1990).  xxxd2215xxx  elicits these
dierent eects by blocking atp-sensitive k+ channels
(katp channels) in the cell membrane. katp channels are
closed by intracellular atp and opened by mgadp and
therefore link membrane potential to the metabolic state of
the cell (ashcroft & ashcroft, 1990; nichols & lederer,
1991).
katp channels are composed of two types of subunits, the
pore-forming subunits (kir6.x) and the sulphonylurea
receptors (surs) (reviews: ashcroft & gribble, 1998;
aguilar-bryan & bryan, 1999; seino, 1999). surs are
members of the atp-binding cassette protein superfamily
*author for correspondence; e-mail: ulrich.quast@uni-tuebingen.de

(aguilar-bryan et al., 1995; sakura et al., 1995; tusnaâdy et
al., 1997). they carry binding sites for nucleotides (ueda et
al., 1997; 1999; matsuo et al., 1999; 2000) for the
sulphonylureas and for the k+ channel openers, a class of
compounds which activate these channels (aguilar-bryan et
al., 1995; hambrock et al., 1998; schwanstecher et al., 1998;
ashcroft & gribble, 2000). two main subtypes of sur have
been characterized.  xxxg19xxx  is the dominant form in pancreatic
b-cells and in brain (aguilar-bryan et al., 1995; sakura et al.,
1995) and  xxxg20xxx  in muscle.  xxxg20xxx  exists in two isoforms
which dier only in the last exon (42 amino acids). one
isoform (sur2a) is found in striated and the other (sur2b)
in smooth muscle (inagaki et al., 1996; isomoto et al., 1996).
 xxxg19xxx  has a higher anity for the sulphonylureas than the
 xxxg20xxx  isoforms (aguilar-bryan et al., 1995; doèrschner et al.,
1999; russ et al., 1999; 2001). this is due, at least in part, to
serine in position 1206 in  xxxg19xxx  (mouse numbering) being
exchanged to tyrosine in  xxxg20xxx  (ash®eld et al., 1999).
mutating ser to tyr in  xxxg19xxx  abolishes high anity
 xxxd2215xxx  binding and high anity channel inhibition
by  xxxd3394xxx  (ash®eld et al., 1999). conversely, exchan-

a. hambrock et al

ging tyr 1206 in sur2b for ser increases the anity of
 xxxd2215xxx  binding 5 ± 10 times (toman et al., 2000;
hambrock et al., 2001; loèer-walz et al., 2002). the pore
forming subunit of classical katp channels is  xxxg1250xxx .
the potency and ecacy of sulphonylureas in closing katp
channels depend on the nucleotides present with adp being
particularly important (pancreatic b-cells: zuènkler et al.,
1988; cardiac myocyte: venkatesh et al., 1991; miyamura et
al., 2000). [3h]- xxxd2215xxx  binding studies in membranes
from pancreatic b-cells and brain (i.e. predominantly  xxxg1250xxx /
 xxxg19xxx ) have shown that atp reduces  xxxd2215xxx  binding.
the presence of mg2+ is required for this eect and nonhydrolysable atp analogues like b,g-methyleneadenosine 5'triphosphate (amp ± pcp) are inactive (reviewed in ashcroft
& ashcroft, 1992). schwanstecher and colleagues showed that
this inhibition was due to a reduction in the anity of sur
for  xxxd2215xxx  by mgatp binding to a site dierent from
the  xxxd2215xxx  site (schwanstecher et al., 1991; 1992).
mgadp also inhibits  xxxd2215xxx  binding to sur in
pancreatic islets and brain (review: ashcroft & ashcroft,
1992); however, in this case, inhibition was reported to re¯ect
a reduction of the number of binding sites, bmax
(gopalakrishnan et al., 1991).
when assessing these studies one has to consider that
during incubation of atp with membranes a substantial
amount is hydrolysed to adp by various atpases;
conversely, adp is converted in membranes to atp
(+amp) by adenylate kinase (gopalakrishnan et al., 1991;
schwanstecher et al., 1991; hambrock et al., 1999). hence,
binding studies, in which atp or adp are added in the
presence of mg2+ without taking precautionary measures,
re¯ect the action of a combination of the nucleotides.
however, atp hydrolysis can be counteracted by coupling
of an atp-regenerating system (ars, e.g. based on the
creatine kinase reaction in which the high phosphate group
transfer potential of creatine phosphate is used to resynthesise atp from adp (gopalakrishnan et al., 1991; dickinson
et al., 1997; hambrock et al., 1999). similarly, the adenylate
kinase reaction can be counteracted by coupling of an atpconsuming system (acs), e.g. the hexokinase reaction in
which the atp formed is converted back to adp by
phosphorylation of glucose. schwanstecher et al. (1991)
found that mgadp did not aect  xxxd2215xxx  binding to
membranes from pancreatic islets if atp formation was
prevented by the hexokinase reaction.
these complexities are long known. however, we are not
aware of studies in which the modulation of  xxxd2215xxx 
binding to katp channels (or sur subtypes) by atp and
adp was assessed in parallel in the absence and presence of
the respective nucleotide-regenerating systems. here, we
present such a study in order to assess the eects of the
two nucleotides separately as well as the degree of synergy
between them. another problem concerns potential dierences between the dierent sur subtypes. in case of
sur2a/b, knowledge about the allosteric coupling between
nucleotide and  xxxd2215xxx  binding is particularly scarce,
probably due to the lower anity of the  xxxg20xxx  isoforms for
 xxxd2215xxx . in order to obtain better  xxxd2215xxx 
binding, we have used mutants with increased sulphonylurea
anity ( xxxg20xxx (y1206s), see above). for sur2b(y1206s) it
was shown that the coupling between atp binding and
 xxxd2215xxx  or opener binding is unperturbed and that

upon coexpression with  xxxg1250xxx  a typical  xxxg1253xxx  is
formed (hambrock et al., 2001; loèer-walz et al., 2002).
sur2a(y1206s) behaves quite similarly; the full characterization of this mutant will be presented elsewhere.

methods
 xxxg20xxx  mutants, cell culture, transfection and membrane
preparation
the mutants sur2a(y1206s) and sur2b(y1206s) were
constructed from murine sur2a or sur2b (genbank
accession numbers d86037 and d86038, respectively; isomoto et al., 1996) using the site-directed mutagenesis system
(stratagene, amsterdam, the netherlands) as described for
mutant sur2b (hambrock et al., 2001). the presence of the
mutation was con®rmed by nucleotide sequencing of the
relevant dna region. human embryonic kidney (hek) 293
cells were cultured in minimum essential medium containing
glutamine and supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum
and 20 mg ml71  xxxd2193xxx  (hambrock et al., 1998). cells
were transfected with the pcdna 3.1 vector (invitrogen,
karlsruhe, germany) containing the coding sequence of rat
 xxxg19xxx  (genbank accession number x97279), sur2a(y1206s) or sur2b(y1206s), and cell lines stably
expressing these proteins were isolated as described previously (hambrock et al., 1998). for binding studies on
 xxxg1250xxx /sur complexes, cells were transfected with  xxxg1250xxx 
(genbank accession number d50581, inagaki et al., 1996)
and sur at a molar plasmid ratio of 1 : 1 for transient
expression.
for cells stably expressing sur alone, the antibiotic was
withdrawn from the culture medium one week prior to
membrane preparation; cells transiently expressing  xxxg1250xxx /
sur were harvested 2 ± 3 days after transfection. membranes
were prepared as described (hambrock et al., 1998). in brief,
cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 500 g and 48c and lysed
by addition of ice-cold hypotonic buer containing (in mm):
hepes, 10; egta, 1 at ph 7.4. the lysate was centrifuged
at 105 g and 48c for 60 min and the resulting membrane
pellet was resuspended in a buer containing (in mm):
hepes, 5; kcl, 5; nacl, 139; at ph 7.4 and 48c at a protein
concentration of *1.5 ± 3.0 mg protein ml71 and frozen at
7808c. protein concentration was determined according to
lowry et al. (1951) using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as the
standard.

[3h]- xxxd2215xxx  binding experiments
to study [3h]- xxxd2215xxx  binding to sur, membranes
(®nal protein concentration  xxxg19xxx : 50 ± 100 mg protein ml71,
 xxxg20xxx : 200 mg protein ml71) were added to the incubation
buer (mm) (nacl 139, kcl 5, hepes 5 mm) supplemented
with [3h]- xxxd2215xxx  (*1 nm for  xxxg19xxx  and 2 ± 2.5 nm for
 xxxg20xxx , respectively) at 378c. after 15 min at 378c incubation
was stopped by diluting 0.3 ml aliquots in triplicate into 8 ml
of quench solution (50 mm tris-(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane, 154 mm nacl, ph 7.4) at 08c and ®ltration over
whatman gf/b ®lters. non-speci®c binding was determined
in the presence of 1 mm  xxxd2215xxx  ( xxxg19xxx ) or 100 mm
unlabelled p1075 ( xxxg20xxx ) and ranged from 6+1% of total

a. hambrock et al

binding ( xxxg19xxx ) to 22 ± 32% ( xxxg20xxx ). non-transfected hek
293 cells possess endogenous low anity  xxxd2215xxx  sites
which are not sensitive to p1075, which, however, completely
displaces speci®c  xxxd2215xxx  binding (= xxxd2215xxx 
binding to mutant surb2 (hambrock et al., 2001) and
sur2a (e. strauû, personal communication)).
atp and adp were added as the sodium salts and
[mg2+]free was kept at 51 mm. the atp-regenerating system
(ars) consisted of creatine kinase (5 u ml71) and creatine
phosphate (3 mm) in the presence of 10 mm mg2+ as
described (hambrock et al., 1999). in some experiments the
system was scaled up to creatine kinase (50 u ml71) and
creatine phosphate (20 mm) in the presence of 25 mm mg2+.
the atp-consuming system (acs) consisted of hexokinase
(5 u ml71) and glucose (11 mm). in case of mg2+-free
experiments, mg2+ was omitted from the incubation solution
and edta (1 mm) was added.

to analyse biphasic curves, the superposition of two logistic

kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant, l the concentration of the radioligand and a the proportionality constant
describing nonspeci®c binding as a linear function of l.
nonspeci®c binding was determined as described above.
speci®c binding was also plotted in the scatchard presentation (scatchard, 1949).
curves were analysed according to the method of least
squares using the sigmaplot programme (spss, inc, chicago,
il, u.s.a.). errors in the parameters were estimated
assuming that amplitudes and pic50 values are normally
distributed (christopoulos, 1998). these were then averaged
and pic50 values+s.e.mean were converted to ic50 values
with the 95% con®dence interval.

materials
[3h]- xxxd2215xxx  (speci®c activity 1.85 tbq (52 ci) mmol71)
was purchased from perkin elmer life sciences (bad
homburg, germany). the reagents and media used for cell
culture and transfection were from invitrogen (karlsruhe,
germany). na2atp and na2adp were from roche
diagnostics (mannheim, germany); creatine kinase, creatine
phosphate, hexokinase, adenosine 5' monophosphate (amp),
a,b-methyleneadenosine 5'-diphosphate (amp ± pcp), b,gmethyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate (amp ± cp) and  xxxd2215xxx  from sigma (deisenhofen, germany). nucleotides

were dissolved in incubation buer keeping ph  xxxd2274xxx .4. p1075
and  xxxd2215xxx  were dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide/
ethanol (1 : 1) and further diluted in the same solvent or in
incubation buer. in binding studies solvent concentration
was always below 0.2%.

results
[3h]- xxxd2215xxx  binding to sur and adenine
nucleotides
in the presence of mg2+, atp and adp inhibited [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding to the three sur subtypes (figure
1a,c) whereas amp (0.1 and 1 mm) was ineective (not
illustrated). in the absence of mg2+ (no mg2+ added, 1 mm
edta), neither atp nor adp aected [3h]- xxxd2215xxx 
binding, nor did mg2+ (1 ± 10 mm) in the absence of
nucleotides. further experiments, conducted with sur2b
(y1206s), showed that the non-hydrolysable analogues of
atp and adp, amp ± pcp and amp ± cp (both at 0.1 and
1 mm), were ineective regardless of the presence of mg2+
(not shown). these data with mutant sur2b extend earlier
studies which showed that reduction of  xxxd2215xxx  binding
to  xxxg19xxx -containing katp channels required the presence of
mg2+ and of hydrolysable nucleotides (ashcroft & ashcroft,
1992). the experiments described below were conducted in
the presence of free mg2+ (*1 mm) and it is understood that
the mg2+-complexes of the adenine nucleotides are the active
components.

inhibition of [3h]- xxxd2215xxx  binding to sur by atp
figure 1a shows the concentration-dependent inhibition of
[3h]- xxxd2215xxx  binding to  xxxg19xxx  and the two mutant
 xxxg20xxx  subtypes by mgatp. atp reduced binding to  xxxg19xxx 
and sur2b(y1206s) by 470%; in case of sur2a(y1206s),
the extent of inhibition was slightly less. the inhibition curve
of  xxxg19xxx  exhibited two components of similar amplitudes
with ic50 values of 3.9 and 224 mm (see table 1 for
parameters). the inhibition curves of the  xxxg20xxx  mutants
were monophasic and had similar ic50 values (*8 mm); the
curve for mutant sur2b showed slight cooperativity
(nh=1.20+0.02).
during incubation with membranes in the presence of
mg2+, atp is hydrolysed partly to adp, and figure 1a
therefore re¯ects the combined eect of mgatp in the
presence of some mgadp (see introduction). the amount of
adp formed can be reduced to about 1/10 (i.e. to *1% of
the amount of atp initially present) by coupling of an atpreconstituting system (ars) based on the creatine phosphatecreatine kinase reaction (hambrock et al., 1999). figure 1b
shows the eect of atp in the presence of the ars using
5 u ml71 creatine kinase. under these conditions, the mgatp
inhibition curve of [3h]- xxxd2215xxx  binding to  xxxg19xxx 
remained biphasic. the ®rst component showed an unchanged ic50 value (3.9 vs 4.7 mm) but was smaller in
amplitude; the second shifted rightwards by a factor of *5
(from 220 to 1300 mm). surprisingly, the inhibition curve of
sur2b(y1206s), which showed positive cooperativity in the
absence of the ars, become also biphasic: a prominent ®rst
components with an ic50 value similar to that obtained

value at 1 mm adp (n=4).

before (*6 ± 9 mm) was followed by a small low anity
component (ic50 *230 mm). the inhibition curve of
sur2a(y1206s) remained monophasic with an ic50 value
again similar to that in the absence of the ars; however, the
extent of inhibition was now only 21%. this showed that
mgadp is a major modulator of [3h]- xxxd2215xxx  binding
to mutant sur2a.
the high concentrations of mgatp (4mm) needed to
saturate the low anity components of the  xxxg19xxx  and
mutant sur2b curves (figure 1b) raised the suspicion that
the ars may have been insucient and that contaminating
mgadp may have contributed to these components. this
possibility was tested by scaling up the ars 10 fold (creatine
british journal of pharmacology vol 136 (7)

kinase 50 u ml71, creatine phosphate 20 mm, mg2+ 25 mm).
repeating the inhibition curve of  xxxg19xxx  under these
conditions resulted only in a minor change in the amplitudes
and left the ic50 values unchanged (data not illustrated). this
showed that the down-scaled ars used in figure 1c was
adequate.
in the course of these experiments it was noticed that [3h] xxxd2215xxx  bound to creatine kinase, increasing the
amount of binding displaced by 1 mm gbc by 25+3% at
a creatine kinase concentration of *161 mg protein ml71 in
the presence of 50 mg membrane protein ml71 ( xxxg19xxx ). this
was not observed with the  xxxg20xxx  subtypes since the ratio of
creatine kinase to membrane protein was smaller (16 : 200 mg

a. hambrock et al

protein ml71). binding of gbc to sur was, however, not
aected by the ars which is noteworthy in view of the fact
that creatine kinase (crawford et al., 2002) and adenylate
kinase (carrasco et al., 2001; see below) form supramolecular
complexes with the  xxxg1253xxx  in cardiocytes.

inhibition of  xxxd2215xxx  binding to sur by adp
the results obtained with adp qualitatively resembled those with
atp (figure 1c). the  xxxg19xxx  curve was again biphasic; however,
with adp, the amplitude ratio of the two phases was 20 : 80% and
the ic50 values were shifted leftwards (1.4 and 40 mm). the
inhibition curves of the  xxxg20xxx  mutants were monophasic with
ic50 values (*15 mm) about two times higher than measured with
atp. in all cases, the extent of inhibition by adp was slightly but
signi®cantly larger than observed with atp.
to counteract synthesis of atp from adp by adenylate
kinase during incubation, experiments were conducted also in
the presence of an atp-consuming system (acs) based on
the glucose ± hexokinase reaction (see methods). the presence
of the acs did not aect  xxxd2215xxx  binding to sur.
figure 1d shows that in the presence of the acs, the adp
inhibition curves were all monophasic and shifted towards
higher concentrations (table 1). most importantly, binding
to  xxxg19xxx  was inhibited only by 47% (as compared to an
amplitude of 87% in the absence of the acs, see table 1); in
contrast, the inhibition curves with mutant  xxxg20xxx  exhibited
amplitudes of 78%. this showed that mgadp alone was
more eective on the  xxxg20xxx  subtypes than on  xxxg19xxx . the
hill coecients of the inhibition curves were 41 with those
of the  xxxg20xxx  curves approaching 2 (table 1). amp, which is
formed by hydrolysis of mgadp or by the adenylate kinase
reaction, is ineective in modulating [3h]- xxxd2215xxx 
binding (see above).

effects of mgatp on [3h]- xxxd2215xxx  binding to
 xxxg1250xxx /sur complexes
experiments were performed also using membranes from cells
transiently expressing  xxxg1250xxx + xxxg19xxx  or sur2b(y1206s).
the results in figure 1 had shown that the eects of mgatp
were most prominent in the absence of an ars. in order to
pick up eventually small changes induced by coexpression
with  xxxg1250xxx , the mgatp dependence was measured therefore
in the absence of an ars. figure 2 illustrates that atp
inhibited  xxxd2215xxx  binding to  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  in a
monophasic manner with an amplitude of 20% and an ic50
value of 56 mm (table 1). adp (1 mm) inhibited  xxxd2215xxx  binding to the  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  complex by 25% and the
amplitude was reduced further to 11% in the presence of the
acs (table 1). in case of sur2b(y1206s), the eects of
coexpression with  xxxg1250xxx  were less stringent: the inhibition
curve was shifted rightwards by a factor of 2, the amplitude
reduced (from 74 to 57%) and the co-operativity increased
(from 1.2 to 1.6, figure 2 and table 1).

effects of mgatp on [3h]- xxxd2215xxx  saturation
experiments
in order to see whether the inhibitory eect of mgatp on
[3h]- xxxd2215xxx  binding to sur was due to a reduction in
anity or in the number of high anity binding sites (bmax)

 xxxd2215xxx  binding to sur and adenine nucleotides

999

or in both, saturation binding experiments were performed in
the absence and presence of saturating mgatp (figure 3,
table 2). in the case of  xxxg19xxx , mgatp increased the kd
value about six times leaving bmax unchanged. it is easily
calculated that at a [3h]- xxxd2215xxx  concentration of 1 nm,
an increase in kd from 0.9 to 5.2 nm reduces binding of the
radioligand by 70% as is indeed the case (figure 1). in
contrast, for both mutant  xxxg20xxx  subtypes, mgatp reduced
bmax and left kd unaltered.

discussion
effects of atp in the presence of an ars
`pure' atp reduced [3h]- xxxd2215xxx  binding to all sur
subtypes with a high anity component (ic50 values 5 to
10 mm). in case of  xxxg19xxx , the ic50 value agrees well with the
kd of atp binding to nbf1 (matsuo et al., 2000; here:
table 1). this could mean that atp binding to nbf1 and
hydrolysis there (bienengraeber et al., 2000) mediates the
inhibition of [3h]- xxxd2215xxx  binding to  xxxg19xxx . in case of
mutant sur2a/b, however, such speculation is applied less
easily; here, the respective ic50 values of the atp inhibition
curves are *10 times lower than the corresponding kd values
for atp binding to nbf1 (or nbf2) of wild-type sur2a/b.
it is unlikely that this discrepancy is a consequence of the
mutation since there was no dierence in the eect of atp
(-ars) on  xxxd2215xxx  binding to wild-type and mutant
sur2b (loèer-walz et al., 2002). rather, this discrepancy
seems to re¯ect dierences in experimental conditions: the
photoanity labelling experiments were conducted at 08c,
the [3h]- xxxd2215xxx  binding studies at 378c and the
temperature dependence of atp binding and hydrolysis
may dier between the sur subtypes. the dierence in
amplitude between the sur2a(y1206s) curve (21%) and the
high anity component of the sur2b(y1206s) curve (53%)
is of interest. since these isoforms dier only in their last 42
carboxyterminal amino acids this suggests that this part of
the protein may interact with the nbfs (see below).

 xxxd2215xxx  binding to sur and adenine nucleotides

figure 3 [3h]- xxxd2215xxx  binding saturation experiments to sur subtypes in the absence and presence of mgatp. left:
original data, right scatchard representation to directly indicate changes in kd (slope71) and bmax (abscissa intercept); here b
denotes the concentration of the radioligand speci®cally bound and f the free radioligand concentration. experiments in the absence
of mgatp were performed in the presence of edta (1 mm), experiments at saturating mgatp in the presence of 1 mm (mutant
sur2a/b) or 3 mm mgatp ( xxxg19xxx ). individual experiments (n=3 ± 5) were evaluated according to equation 2 in methods (mean
parameters listed in table 2), original data were then normalized to 100% binding at saturation and pooled. 95% con®dence bands
in the scatchard representation were calculated according to draper & smith (1981). nonspeci®c binding was proportional to
radioligand concentration with slopes ranging from 34 to 39 fmol mg71 nm71 for the sur subtypes in the presence of mgatp and
53 to 60 fmol mg71 nm71 in its absence, respectively.

in the case of  xxxg19xxx  and sur2b(y1206s), the mgatp
inhibition curve exhibited also a low anity component. the
respective ic50 values did not correlate with the kd values
for atp binding to either nbf as determined by the ueda
group (table 1). the fact that the low anity component was
seen with sur2b(y1206s) but not with sur2a(y1206s)
highlights again the importance of the carboxyterminus.
interestingly, the curve for  xxxg19xxx  showed also a second
component. this ®ts with the fact that the amino acids of last
carboxyterminal exon of (rat)  xxxg19xxx  and (mouse) sur2b
british journal of pharmacology vol 136 (7)

show a high degree of identity (74%) whereas that of (mouse)
sur2a is dierent (33% identity with sur2b; isomoto et
al., 1996). the carboxyterminus of sur is an important
modulator of the eects of nucleotides on channel activation
and on the interaction of the channel with openers (shindo et
al., 1998; hambrock et al., 1999; matsuoka et al., 2000;
reimann et al., 2000). the data presented here show that
sur2a stands out also regarding the modulation of
 xxxd2215xxx  binding by (pure) mgatp; the ecacy of
mgatp at this isoform is strikingly poor.

a. hambrock et al

effects of adp in the presence of an acs
the inhibition curves of `pure' adp alone for all surs were
monophasic with ic50 values ranging from 63 to 170 mm.
these values are in reasonable agreement with the kd values
for adp binding to the nbfs (or with the mean of the two
values) determined by matsuo et al. (2000) (table 1).
mgadp displayed a particularly high ecacy at the
 xxxg20xxx (y1206s) isoforms leading to a marked ecacy
dierence between adp and atp at mutant sur2a.
conversely, at  xxxg19xxx , atp is more ecacious than adp.
all adp curves displayed positive cooperativity (hill
coecients 41) and this was strongest with the
 xxxg20xxx (y1206s) subtypes. the positive cooperativity of the
inhibition curves could re¯ect positive cooperativity of
mgadp binding to the nbfs at 378c; however, no
cooperativity was observed by matsuo et al. (2000) at 08c.
alternatively, binding of one molecule of mgadp may aect
the binding of more than one molecule of  xxxd2215xxx . this
possibility is most easily explained if sur expressed alone
forms homomultimers (e.g. tetramers), and, recently, we have
indeed obtained indirect evidence for tetramerization of
(mutant) sur2b expressed alone (loèer-walz et al.,
2002). in an alternative model the cooperativity could re¯ect
binding of  xxxd2215xxx  to two states of monomeric sur
which are not at equilibrium (boeynaems & dumont, 1980).
without further experiments it is impossible to decide
between these models and it remains intriguing that adp
displays strong positive cooperativity in inhibiting  xxxd2215xxx  binding to the  xxxg20xxx (y1206s) subtypes.

synergy between atp and adp
the equilibrium constant of the adenylate kinase reaction is
*1 under physiological conditions (stryer, 1988) and in the
absence of hexokinase, adp and atp will be present at
comparable concentrations. synergy between the nucleotides,
if it occurs, should therefore be apparent if the adp
inhibition curves in presence and absence of the acs are
compared. in the absence of the acs, the adp inhibition
curves of the  xxxg20xxx (y1206s) isoforms were shifted leftwards
by factors of 6.5 and 10, indicating synergy between adp
and atp; the amplitudes were unchanged and the cooperativity was abolished. for  xxxg19xxx , the curve became biphasic
but was again shifted leftwards; the total amplitude was
larger than that reached with adp or atp alone.
in the case of atp in the absence of the ars, the amount
of atp hydrolysis under our experimental conditions ranges
from total at low mm atp to 10% at mm atp
concentrations (hambrock et al., 1999). in the absence of

table 2

the ars, the most signi®cant changes in the atp inhibition
curves were the 6 fold leftward shift of the low anity
component of the  xxxg19xxx  curve, the more than tripling of the
amplitude of the sur2a(y1206s) curve and the fact that the
biphasic sur2b(y1206s) curve became monophasic with
positive cooperativity. collectively, the various leftward shifts
of the inhibition curves observed in the absence of the
respective reconstituting enzyme system are a clear indication
that atp and adp together are more potent than either one
alone in inhibiting  xxxd2215xxx  binding.

saturation experiments: differences between  xxxg19xxx  and
 xxxg20xxx 
in case of  xxxg19xxx , atp antagonised  xxxd2215xxx  binding by
reducing the anity, leaving the number of binding sites
unchanged. this result is in agreement with earlier experiments in membranes from pancreatic islets (schwanstecher et
al., 1991). the data for  xxxg19xxx  are compatible with a classical
two-state scheme in which the receptor exists in two
interconvertible states and mgatp shifts the equilibrium
towards the state with lower anity for  xxxd2215xxx  in a
homogeneous manner (boeynaems & dumont, 1980).
in case of the  xxxg20xxx (y1206s) isoforms, atp reduced the
number of observed binding sites, leaving the kd value of the
remaining sites unchanged. this means that mgatp created
an inhomogeneity by shifting a certain proportion of the high
anity sites (*43% for sur2a(y1206s) and *71% for
sur2b(y1206s)) towards lower anity so that they escaped
detection in the radioligand binding assay; the other sites
remained in the high anity form (kd unaected). there are
at least two models which can account for this inhomogeneity
(see also above). the ®rst assumes that  xxxg20xxx , expressed
alone, forms tetramers with the degree of negative allosteric
coupling between subunits depending on the isoform. in case
of [sur2b(y1206s)]4, occupation of the nucleotide sites
allows high anity binding of only one  xxxd2215xxx 
molecule per tetramer; in case of [sur2a(y1206s)]4, two
 xxxd2215xxx  molecules per tetramer may bind with high
anity. the second model assumes monomeric sur cycling
between two states at steady state but not at equilibrium; the
cycle is fuelled by the hydrolysis of atp (boeynaems &
dumont, 1980; loèeer-walz et al., 2002). whatever the case,
these experiments highlight an intriguing mechanistic dierence between  xxxg19xxx  and (mutant)  xxxg20xxx .

and  xxxg20xxx  and  xxxg20xxx (y1206s). this was particularly marked
for  xxxg19xxx  where the amplitude of the atp inhibition curve
was decreased from 72% to 20%. a (minor) part of this
decrease in amplitude is, however, explained by the
experimental conditions since at  xxxg19xxx , mgatp acts by
decreasing the anity for  xxxd2215xxx  (see above). considering that coexpression with  xxxg1250xxx  increases the anity of
 xxxg19xxx  for  xxxd2215xxx  by 2 times (kd values in the absence
of mgatp: 0.88 and 0.40 nm, respectively), the law of mass
action predicts a reduction in amplitude from 72 to *50%
at a radioligand concentration of 1 nm. hence, a large part of
the amplitude decrease is a real consequence of contransfection. in addition, coexpression with  xxxg1250xxx  rendered the
atp inhibition curve monophasic with an ic50 value (56 mm)
in between the ic50 values of the biphasic atp curve for
 xxxg19xxx  alone (3.9 and 220 mm). the data obtained here for
 xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  at 378c are at variance with results obtained in
membranes from pancreatic islets at 228c where an atp
inhibition curve with ic50=11.6 mm, amplitude *60% and
hill coecient 1.5 was reported (schwanstecher et al., 1991).
in addition, mgatp was found to be without eect if the
hexokinase reaction was coupled whereas we found a residual
eect of 11%. these dierences may be due to dierent
experimental conditions, in particular temperature.
for sur2b(y1206s) too, coexpression with  xxxg1250xxx 
reduced the negative allosteric eect of atp on  xxxd2215xxx 
binding in potency and ecacy; however, the changes were
less pronounced than with  xxxg19xxx . collectively, these results
(together with the increase in  xxxd2215xxx  anity of  xxxg19xxx 
upon coexpression with  xxxg1250xxx , see above) are a further
example in point that coexpression with kir6.x aects the
properties of  xxxd2215xxx  binding to sur (hambrock et
al., 2001).

limitations of the study
the results presented here have been interpreted assuming
that the nucleotide eects on [3h]- xxxd2215xxx  binding were
mediated by nucleotide binding to the nbfs of sur. this
assumption is based mainly on the analogy with opener
binding to sur. in this case, the presence of mg2+ and of
atp or a hydrolysable analogue is required (schwanstecher
et al., 1992; quast et al., 1993). in addition, it has been
shown that mutation of the lys residue in the walker a
motif of either nbf abolishes opener binding to sur2b and

 xxxd2215xxx  binding to sur and adenine nucleotides

opener-induced activation of the  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b channel
(schwanstecher et al., 1998). this indicates that the activating
eect of mgatp on opener binding is mediated by nucleotide
binding to the nbfs. in case of the adenine nucleotide eects
on  xxxd2215xxx  binding, the presence of mg2+ and of
hydrolysable atp/adp analogues was also required (see
results). in addition, it has been shown that  xxxd2215xxx 
releases bound atp from  xxxg19xxx , demonstrating a direct
interaction between the nbfs and the  xxxd2215xxx  site of
sur (ueda et al., 1999). however, one should be aware that
at least part of the mgatp eects could be mediated
indirectly, e.g. by activation of lipid and/or protein kinases
and more direct evidence for the involvement of the nbfs in
the eects reported here is required.
in addition, one should note that the results reported here
for  xxxd2215xxx  do not necessarily apply to other
sulphonylureas. substantial dierences in the selectivity of
dierent sulphonylureas for the sur subtypes have been
observed (see e.g. quast, 1996; gribble et al., 1998; lawrence
et al., 2001; song & ashcroft, 2001), indicating dierential
interactions of the sulphonylureas with the sur subtypes
and possibly also with the nbfs. however, with the data for
the radioligand, [3h]- xxxd2215xxx , available it is now
possible to study other sulphonylureas available only in
unlabelled form.

conclusion
in conclusion, we have investigated the negative allosteric
modulation of [3h]- xxxd2215xxx  binding to the sur
subtypes by atp and adp in the presence and absence of
the respective reconstituting enzyme systems, i.e. by the `pure'
nucleotides and by their combination. the data show that the
eects of atp and adp dier from one another, that they
depend on the sur subtype, and that they are weakened by
coexpression with  xxxg1250xxx .
