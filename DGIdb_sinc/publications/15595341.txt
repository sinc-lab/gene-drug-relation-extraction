osteoporosis associated with  xxxd2557xxx 
robert a. wermers, md; daniel l. hurley, md; and ann e. kearns, md
 xxxd2557xxx  is a progestational agent for treatment of
metastatic breast cancer and endometrial cancer.  xxxd2557xxx  has
also been used as an appetite stimulant for patients with human
immunodeficiency virus and malignancy who experience cachexia
and wasting; also,  xxxd2557xxx  can be beneficial in relieving hot
flashes in women and men.  xxxd2557xxx  has been shown to have a
glucocorticoidlike effect and has been associated with substantial suppression of plasma estradiol levels. we describe 2 patients
who recently presented to our metabolic bone disease clinic with
severe osteoporosis complicated by multiple vertebral fractures
experienced while the patients were receiving high-dose
 xxxd2557xxx  therapy. the patients had evidence of adrenal axis
suppression but recovered fully after  xxxd2557xxx  was discontinued.
we speculate that  xxxd2557xxx  was an important factor in the
development of osteoporosis and subsequent fractures. further
study is warranted to clarify the relationship between  xxxd2557xxx 
and its potential for adversely affecting the skeleton.

egestrol acetate is a progestational agent for treatment of metastatic breast cancer and endometrial
cancer.  xxxd2557xxx  is also used for treatment of anorexia and
cachexia associated with cancer and human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) and has been shown to reduce hot
flashes in both women and men. glucocorticoidlike activity with  xxxd2557xxx  use reportedly has led to the development of cushing syndrome, diabetes mellitus, suppression
of the hypothalamic-pituitary-axis, and adrenal insufficiency.1 in addition, substantial suppression of plasma
estradiol levels has been described with  xxxd2557xxx  use.2,3
we encountered 2 patients with severe osteoporosis complicated by acute vertebral compression fractures experienced while the patients were receiving high-dose
 xxxd2557xxx  therapy. onset of fractures and subsequent diagnosis of osteoporosis occurred within 18 months after initiation of therapy. to our knowledge, this is the first report of a
possible association between  xxxd2557xxx  and osteoporosis.
report of cases
case 1
a 68-year-old postmenopausal white woman presented to
the metabolic bone disease clinic for evaluation of severe
osteoporosis. menopause had occurred at age 50 years. the
patient had received estrogen-replacement therapy for 15
years; however, therapy was discontinued when she was
diagnosed as having esophageal carcinoma at age 66 years.
mayo clin proc.

•

the patient underwent chemotherapy and radiation therapy
before surgical resection of her tumor.  xxxd2557xxx  (400 mg
twice daily) was initiated for appetite stimulation and was
taken for 2 years, until the patient’s metabolic bone disease clinic evaluation. six months previously, the patient
had experienced a painful spontaneous vertebral compression fracture of t12. dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
revealed lumbar spine (l2-4) bone mineral density (bmd)
to be 0.665 g/cm2 (t score, –3.08; z score, –1.71) and
nondominant femoral neck bmd to be 0.532 g/cm2 (t
score, –4.1; z score, –1.83).
the patient had no history of malabsorption, glucocorticoid exposure, tobacco smoking, or alcohol ingestion and
no family history of osteoporosis.
physical examination revealed a weight of 54.5 kg and a
body mass index of 24.2 kg/m2. the patient was in a
wheelchair because of back pain. examination of the spine
was notable for thoracic kyphosis and tenderness over the
thoracic spinous processes. ecchymoses were present on
the patient’s arms, and she had mild facial fullness.
findings on evaluation for secondary causes of osteoporosis were unremarkable and included the following
normal serum studies: complete blood cell count, liver
function tests, creatinine, bone alkaline phosphatase, calcium, and albumin. the 25-hydroxyvitamin d level was
adequate at 51 ng/ml. the patient’s 24-hour urine calcium
excretion was 85 mg, but the specimen was likely
undercollected based on a creatinine level of 11 mg/kg per
24 h in the specimen (reference range, 15-25 mg/kg per 24
h). the 24-hour urine type 1 collagen cross-linked amino
terminal telopeptide (ntx, a marker for bone resorption)
was in the low-normal range at 20 nmol/mmol creatinine
(normal premenopausal range, 19-63 nmol/mmol creatinine), but as noted, the collection was likely incomplete.
magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine was notable for multiple vertebral compression fractures including t10, t11, t12, and l1.
the patient’s daughter, a registered pharmacist, had
noted her mother’s increased facial fullness and abdominal

use, she would become ill and experience nausea and vomiting. cortisol was undetectable in a 24-hour urinary free
cortisol test. no exogenous glucocorticoids, other than
 xxxd2557xxx , were detected using a synthetic glucocorticoid
screening test with tandem mass spectroscopy performed
on the same urine specimen. a 1-µg  xxxd1755xxx  (corticotropin) stimulation test revealed a baseline serum cortisol
level of 1.6 µg/dl at 8 am and maximal cortisol level of 6.0
µg/dl 2 hours later, indicative of adrenal glucocorticoid
suppression or adrenal gland insufficiency. the patient’s
serum corticotropin level was 4.9 pg/ml (reference range,
10-60 pg/ml) at 8 am.  xxxd2557xxx  was discontinued, and 5

recovery of the patient’s adrenal gland axis was documented
with another 1-µg  xxxd1755xxx  stimulation test (baseline serum
cortisol level of 11 µg/dl  xxxd1891xxx  am and maximal cortisol
level of 22 µg/dl 45 minutes later), consistent with adrenal
gland suppression during prior  xxxd2557xxx  therapy.
case 2
a 54-year-old postmenopausal white woman was referred
to the metabolic bone disease clinic for evaluation of
osteoporosis with multiple vertebral compression fractures. she had undergone surgery for abdominal pain and
possible pancreatic carcinoma 13 months previously, but
no malignancy had been found. her postoperative course
was complicated by nephritis and a pulmonary embolism,
requiring placement of a greenfield filter and tracheostomy.  xxxd2557xxx  (400 mg twice daily) was initiated for

appetite stimulation. exploratory laparotomy was performed 6 months later for persistent abdominal pain but
was unrevealing. approximately 2 months later, during
rehabilitation, the patient experienced compression vertebral fractures of t12 and l4.
menopause had occurred at age 45 years, and the patient
had never received estrogen therapy. she had no history of
fractures, osteoporosis, or glucocorticoid use. medication
use included phenytoin and warfarin at the time of her
evaluation, both drugs having been initiated during her
recent illness. the patient had a history of alcohol abuse but
had been abstinent for the past 71/2 years. her family history was unremarkable for osteoporosis. physical examination was notable for a weight of 55.6 kg and body mass
index of 25.4 kg/m2, moderate thoracic kyphosis, and tenderness in the lumbosacral region.
the patient’s lumbar spine (l3) bmd, measured by
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, was 0.75 g/cm2 (t score,
–3.7; z score, –2.7); her nondominant femoral neck bmd
was 0.57 g/cm2 (t score, –3.4; z score, –2.4). magnetic
resonance imaging of the thoracic and lumbar spine revealed compression vertebral fractures of t6, t8-t12, l2,
and l4. magnetic resonance imaging of the spine obtained
approximately 3 months previously showed only the t6,
t12, and l4 compression fractures.
results of the following serum laboratory studies were
normal (reference ranges shown parenthetically): creatinine; serum protein electrophoresis;  xxxd3368xxx , 2.7 miu/
l (0.3-5.0 miu/l);  xxxg1885xxx , 1.8 pmol/l (1.05.2 pmol/l); calcium; phosphorus; and albumin. other
laboratory test results revealed the following: hemoglobin,
11.5 g/dl (12.0-15.5 g/dl); mean corpuscular volume,
101.1 fl (81.6-98.3 fl); 25-hydroxyvitamin d, 23 ng/ml;
aspartate aminotransferase, 60 u/l (12-31 u/l); bone alkaline phosphatase, 159 µm/min/l (11-67 µm/min/l); and
24-hour urine calcium, 96 mg, with evidence of an inadequate collection based on creatinine at 6.8 mg/kg per 24 h.
a morning serum cortisol level  xxxd1891xxx  am was undetectable.
 xxxd2557xxx  was discontinued, and results of a follow-up
morning serum cortisol test 3 months later were normal at
11.2 µg/dl.
discussion
to our knowledge, this is the first report suggesting a
possible association between  xxxd2557xxx  and osteoporosis. both of our patients were receiving high doses of
 xxxd2557xxx , had evidence of adrenal axis suppression, and
recovered fully after discontinuation of the drug. a clear
relationship was seen between initiation of  xxxd2557xxx  and
the timing of vertebral compression fractures. this finding
suggests that  xxxd2557xxx , especially at higher doses, may

osteoporosis associated with  xxxd2557xxx 

negatively affect bone quality and potentially be associated
with bone loss and the development of fractures.
the glucocorticoidlike effect of  xxxd2557xxx  is 1 mechanism that could lead to the development of osteoporosis.
biologically active progestins, including  xxxd2557xxx , have
been shown to have efficient binding to the glucocorticoid
receptor and to the  xxxg1737xxx .4 in fact, highdose  xxxd2554xxx  has been given to patients who have undergone adrenalectomy in the absence of
glucocorticoids, with no reported signs of adrenal insufficiency.5  xxxd2557xxx  also has been shown to have considerable affinity for the  xxxg1601xxx  of human
mononuclear leukocytes and has been associated with immunosuppressive activity in animals.6,7 thus, in vitro data
support the concept that certain progestin compounds have
an important peripheral glucocorticoidlike effect.
several cases of cushing syndrome due to  xxxd2557xxx 
have been reported.1,8,9 these observations are consistent
with results of a prospective randomized trial that found
that approximately one quarter of patients taking either
progestin  xxxd2557xxx  or medroxyprogesterone developed a
cushingoid appearance after 3 months.10 another prospective evaluation in 12 patients taking 800 mg of  xxxd2557xxx 
daily revealed that the weight gain associated with
 xxxd2557xxx  was due to an increase in adipose tissue and not
lean tissue mass, again supporting a glucocorticoidlike effect of the drug.11 finally, there have been reports of aseptic
necrosis of the hip, presumably due to a glucocorticoidlike
effect in hiv-seropositive patients taking  xxxd2557xxx .12
 xxxd2557xxx  use has been associated with suppression of
serum cortisol levels in humans.3,13,14 loprinzi et al15 evaluated the effects of  xxxd2557xxx  on the adrenal axis in a prospectively followed cohort of 66 patients. serum cortisol
levels were decreased in all patients receiving 800 mg of
 xxxd2557xxx  daily. furthermore, serum cortisol levels normalized in 3 patients who discontinued use of  xxxd2557xxx . in
5 patients, corticotropin levels were inappropriately decreased, suggesting suppressed hypothalamic-pituitary
function. hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction was documented in 2 patients who had no response to  xxxd2633xxx 
testing. clinically, cushing syndrome was not apparent in
any patient in that study. our patient in case 1 had nausea
and emesis when  xxxd2557xxx  was discontinued, suggestive
of possible adrenal insufficiency. however, this may have
simply represented the known benefit of  xxxd2557xxx  in improving cancer-related nausea and vomiting.16,17
corticosteroids have several well-known adverse effects on bone metabolism including direct inhibition of
osteoblast function, direct enhancement of bone resorption,
inhibition of gastrointestinal calcium absorption, increased
urinary calcium loss, and inhibition of gonadal hormones.18
although traditionally the effect of  xxxd2557xxx  on peripheral
mayo clin proc.

•

endocrine activity (eg, glucose and bone metabolism) was
believed to be minimal, the reported cases of cushing
syndrome associated with  xxxd2557xxx  show the potential for
a peripheral glucocorticoidlike effect. furthermore, there is
a suggested dose effect of  xxxd2557xxx  because cushing syndrome appears to develop during higher-dose therapy.1 the
development of multiple spontaneous vertebral compression fractures as seen in our patients would be typical of
what often occurs in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.
even more compelling are the reports of adverse skeletal
effects from low-dose glucocorticoids that have few clinical features of corticosteroid excess. clinical examples
include reduced bmd in patients using inhaled glucocorticoids19 and in patients with addison disease receiving replacement glucocorticoid therapy.20 also, van staa et al21
have shown that oral prednisone doses as low as 2.5 to 7.5
mg daily are associated with excess fracture risk.
another reported effect of  xxxd2557xxx  that could lead to
osteoporosis is the profound suppression of estradiol production. one group of investigators reported suppression of
follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone in a
group of women with metastatic breast cancer who were
taking  xxxd2557xxx .3 these changes were associated with a
reduction in serum levels of estradiol and sex hormone–
binding globulin. a more recent prospective study involving 12 postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer who took low-dose  xxxd2557xxx  (oral doses escalating
from 40 to 160 mg daily) for 1 month revealed a reduction
in serum levels of testosterone, estradiol, estrone, and  xxxd2046xxx  to 18% to 29% of pretreatment values.2 the
reduction in serum estradiol concentration was similar
to that reported with use of the aromatase inhibitor  xxxd147xxx  and was a secondary phenomenon based on a
35% to 52% reduction of serum gonadotropins (luteinizing
hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone). in that study,
the decrease in serum estradiol and testosterone levels was
dose dependent, although gonadotropins were suppressed
maximally at a dose of 80 mg of  xxxd2557xxx . low levels of
endogenous estrogen in postmenopausal women have been
associated with increased bone turnover, reduced bone
density, and increased fracture risk.22-25 thus, reduced serum estrogen concentrations associated with  xxxd2557xxx  use
are not inconsequential and could lead to increased bone
loss and skeletal fracture.
clinical data suggest increased bone turnover and potential bone loss with  xxxd2557xxx  use. in a randomized study
of postmenopausal women with breast cancer,  xxxd2557xxx 
was associated with increased biochemical markers of
bone resorption compared with placebo.26 likewise, men
receiving androgen deprivation therapy ( xxxd2557xxx  included) for prostate cancer have been reported to have
increased bone loss.27 finally, most prospective studies of

osteoporosis associated with  xxxd2557xxx 

depot medroxyprogesterone in premenopausal women suggest a modest decline in bmd.28
although our report focuses on the possible adverse
skeletal effect of progestational agents, there are data to
suggest beneficial skeletal effects. for example, medroxyprogesterone has been shown to have a positive effect
on calcium homeostasis when given to premenopausal
women receiving  xxxg930xxx  agonist
therapy.29 also, progesterone receptors are present on human
osteoblasts, and progesterone may activate bone formation.30,31 progesterone has been shown to stimulate proliferation and differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells in bone
cells derived from adult female rats.32,33 although progestins have been reported to prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women, other studies have been unable to
show this benefit.34-36
the potential association of  xxxd2557xxx  and osteoporosis
is important to recognize because patients given  xxxd2557xxx 
likely will have other risk factors associated with the development of osteoporosis (as were present in our patients).
women with breast cancer appear to be at increased risk of
osteoporosis because of multiple factors, including premature ovarian failure (a direct effect of chemotherapy) and
perhaps breast cancer itself.37 subjects in the women’s
health initiative observational study with a history of
breast cancer had more than a 28% increased risk of all
types of fractures except hip fractures. this fracture risk
was present after adjustment for other risk factors during a
mean follow-up of 5.1 years.38 similarly, many patients
receiving  xxxd2557xxx  are postmenopausal and predisposed
to bone loss. vitamin d deficiency and reduced calcium
intake in anorexic or cachectic patients may contribute to
secondary hyperparathyroidism and further reduce bone
density. thus, because of the potential adverse skeletal
effects of  xxxd2557xxx , its use is of concern and warrants
further investigation in a population already predisposed to
the development of osteoporosis.
we describe 2 cases that suggest  xxxd2557xxx  may have
been an important factor in the development of osteoporotic fractures. clearly, further study is needed to
clarify the relationship between  xxxd2557xxx  and metabolic
bone disease because case reports do not prove causality.
because of the retrospective nature of these case reports,
baseline bmd tests and radiography of the spine were not
performed before initiation of  xxxd2557xxx . also, we recognize that our patients had several other risk factors for
osteoporosis. however, considering the associated evidence of a glucocorticoidlike effect in our patients’ clinical
presentations, together with the known endocrine effects of
 xxxd2557xxx  on adrenal and ovarian function, we believe that
 xxxd2557xxx  likely contributed to the development of osteoporosis and subsequent fractures in our patients.

conclusions
we have observed 2 cases of severe osteoporosis associated with  xxxd2557xxx  use. both patients showed evidence of
glucocorticoidlike activity based on adrenal axis suppression. recovery of adrenal function after  xxxd2557xxx  was
discontinued was noted in both patients. also, 1 patient
exhibited clinical features of cushing syndrome. on the
basis of the glucocorticoidlike effects and associated suppression of estradiol levels seen with  xxxd2557xxx  use, it is
biologically plausible that  xxxd2557xxx  notably contributed to
the development of osteoporosis and subsequent fractures
in our patients. further study is warranted to clarify the
relationship between  xxxd2557xxx  and its potential adverse
effects on the skeleton.
