breast cancer, chronic myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic
syndromes, oesophageal cancer and pancreatic cancer. this
article summarizes the milestones in the development of
 xxxd2026xxx  leading to the first approvals for advanced and
locally advanced bcc.

1 introduction
the hedgehog (hh) signalling pathway is a developmental
pathway involved in numerous processes, including determination of cell fate, patterning, proliferation, survival and
differentiation [1]. while this pathway is usually silenced
in most adult tissues, aberrant activation of the hh signaling pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
several types of cancer such as basal cell carcinoma (bcc)
[2]. the hh pathway can be stimulated by three hh
ligands: sonic-hh, indian hh and desert-hh, with sonichh being most extensively studied [1]. when these ligands
bind to patched ( xxxg1867xxx ), a protein that acts as a repressor
of the pathway, the inhibition of  xxxg2177xxx  ( xxxg2177xxx ) by
 xxxg1867xxx  is alleviated [1]. activated  xxxg2177xxx  subsequently initiates a downstream signalling cascade leading both to the
activation of transcription factors belonging to the gliomaassociated oncogene (gli) family and to the transcription
of gli target genes [1]. therefore, recent research has
focused on developing new therapeutic strategies to interrupt the hh signaling pathway [1]. one such strategy is to
block the  xxxg2177xxx  receptor, an essential component of the
canonical hh signaling pathway [1, 3].  xxxd2026xxx 
(odomzotm) is an orally bioavailable, small molecule,
 xxxg2177xxx  receptor antagonist that is being developed by
novartis for the treatment of various types of cancer [4].
oral  xxxd2026xxx  received its first global approval in
switzerland on 30 june 2015 for the treatment of adult

phase ii trial (nct02303041)

clinical development of  xxxd2026xxx  in advanced and locally advanced basal cell carcinoma

patients with advanced bcc who are not amenable to
curative surgery or radiation therapy [5]. in july 2015, the us
fda approved oral  xxxd2026xxx  capsules for the treatment of
adult patients with locally advanced bcc that has recurred
following surgery or radiation therapy, or those who are not
candidates for surgery or radiation therapy [6]. the approval
was based on results from the phase ii, randomized, bolt
trial (nct01327053) [6, 7]. additionally,  xxxd2026xxx  has
been approved in the eu for the treatment of adult patients
with locally advanced bcc who are not amenable to curative
surgery or radiation therapy [8]. the recommended dosage
of  xxxd2026xxx  is 200 mg once daily taken on an empty stomach, at least 1 h before or 2 h after a meal [4].
the us approval carries a black box warning regarding
the potential of the drug to cause embryo-fetal death or
severe birth defects when administered to a pregnant
woman and is embryotoxic, fetotoxic and teratogenic in
animals [4]. pregnancy status should be verified prior to the
start of treatment, and both male and female patients
should be warned about these risks and advised to use
effective contraception [4].
submissions to other global authorities for the use of
 xxxd2026xxx  for the treatment of locally advanced bcc are
being contemplated or planned. phase i–ii development is
underway in several other countries for various other
malignancies. clinical studies also evaluated the efficacy
and tolerability of a topical formulation of  xxxd2026xxx  in
patients with basal cell nevus syndrome [9]; however, its
development in this indication was later discontinued.

 xxxd2026xxx  has demonstrated inhibition of hh signaling
and antitumour activity in vitro, and in various in animal models of cancer [10–18]. for instance,  xxxd2026xxx 
inhibited cell viability, neurosphere formation, and gli
transcriptional activity and induced apoptosis by activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of poly (adp-ribose)
polymerase in vitro [10, 12]. additionally,  xxxd2026xxx 
significantly reduced tumour volume by 95 % compared
with untreated mice in a transgenic mouse model of
islet cell neoplasms [15].
in patients with bcc, characteristic features of bcc on
high-resolution skin imaging techniques decreased or disappeared completely during treatment with  xxxd2026xxx  [19].
for instance, imaging revealed a loss of the peripheral rim
surrounding the tumour nodules, loss of peripheral palisading of tumour cells, blurry demarcation of the residual
nodules and an increase in fibrotic tissue [19].
 xxxd2026xxx  exhibits dose- and exposure-dependent inhibition of gli homolog 1 ( xxxg897xxx ) in tumour and normal skin
biopsies [20]. in tumour samples from patients with
advanced bcc,  xxxd2026xxx  200 or 800 mg once daily significantly reduced  xxxg897xxx  levels from baseline after 9 and
17 weeks (p \ 0.0001) [21].
the qtc interval was not prolonged during treatment
with  xxxd2026xxx  800 mg once daily [4].

 xxxd2026xxx : first global approval

2.2 pharmacokinetics
following the administration of a single  xxxd2026xxx  dose
(100–3000 mg) under fasted conditions in patients with cancer, oral  xxxd2026xxx  was rapidly absorbed, with peak concentrations reached within 2–4 h [4, 20]. following a dose of
200 mg once daily, the estimated mean steady-state peak
concentration was 1030 ng/ml, area under the concentration
time curve (auc0–24h) was 22 lgh/ml and minimal concentration was 890 ng/ml [4]. the absolute bioavailability of
 xxxd2026xxx  was low (estimated to be 6–7 %) in volunteers after
800 mg [22].  xxxd2026xxx  exposure was increased by 7.4- to 7.8fold following coadministration with a high-fat meal (approximately 1000 calories with 50 % of calories from fat) [4].
 xxxd2026xxx  exposure was approximately dose proportional up
to 400 mg and less than dose proportional at higher doses
([400 mg), likely because of solubility-limited absorption [4,
20]. twice-daily dosing resulted in higher systemic exposures
compared with the equivalent once-daily regimen [20].
steady-state was reached approximately 4 months after
starting  xxxd2026xxx  and the estimated accumulation at steadystate was 19-fold [4, 20]
absorbed  xxxd2026xxx  was distributed extensively into the
tissues [22]. the estimated apparent steady-state volume of
distribution was 9166 l [4].  xxxd2026xxx  was highly bound to
human plasma proteins in vitro ([97 %) and the binding
was concentration independent [4]. in vitro studies suggest
 xxxd2026xxx  is not a substrate of  xxxg10xxx  (p-glycoprotein),
 xxxg15xxx  ( xxxg15xxx ,  xxxg15xxx ) or  xxxg22xxx  ( xxxg22xxx ) [4].
 xxxd2026xxx  is metabolized primarily via oxidation and
amide hydrolysis [4, 22]. the cytochrome p450 (cyp)
enzyme cyp3a4 is predominant in the metabolism of
 xxxd2026xxx  [4, 23]. the main circulating compound was
unchanged  xxxd2026xxx  (36 % of circulating radioactivity) [4,
22]. the elimination of absorbed  xxxd2026xxx  occurred predominantly or exclusively by metabolism in the liver [4,

22]. of the absorbed dose, approximately 70 % was
eliminated in the feces and 30 % was eliminated in the
urine [4]. no unchanged  xxxd2026xxx  was detected in urine
[4, 22]. according to population pharmacokinetic modeling, the mean elimination half-life of  xxxd2026xxx 
was &28 days [4].
gender, age, bodyweight, mild or moderate renal
impairment and mild hepatic impairment had no clinically
important effects on the exposure to  xxxd2026xxx , according
to a population pharmacokinetic analysis [4].
2.2.1 drug interactions
pharmacokinetic drug interactions are possible when
 xxxd2026xxx  is administered with strong inhibitors of
cyp3a4 (e.g. saquinavir, telithromycin or ketoconazole)
and with moderate inhibitors cyp3a4 (e.g.  xxxd239xxx ,
diltiazem or fluconazole) [4, 23]. the plasma exposure to
 xxxd2026xxx  increases when  xxxd2026xxx  was coadministered
with a strong (ketoconazole) or moderate (erythromycin)
cyp3a4 inhibitor. on this basis, coadministration of
 xxxd2026xxx  with strong or moderate  xxxg590xxx  inhibitors
should be avoided. if coadministration of  xxxd2026xxx  with a
moderate  xxxg590xxx  inhibitor is required, only administer the
moderate  xxxg590xxx  inhibitor for \14 days and monitor
closely for adverse reactions (particularly musculoskeletal
adverse events) [4].
coadministration of  xxxd2026xxx  with strong and moderate
 xxxg590xxx  inducers [e.g. phenytoin, rifampin (rifampicin), st
john’s wort] may decrease the plasma exposure to  xxxd2026xxx ; consequently, concomitant use of  xxxd2026xxx  with
these agents should also be avoided [4].
 xxxd2026xxx  coadministered with a  xxxg215xxx  inhibitor
or a histamine-2-receptor antagonist decreased the geometric mean  xxxd2026xxx  steady-state auc0–24h by 34 %,
based on population pharmacokinetic analysis [4].

daily, respectively. the corresponding proportions of
patients achieving disease control in patients with metastatic disease were 92 and 83 % [7].
2.3.2 medulloblastoma

2.3 therapeutic trials
2.3.1 basal cell carcinoma
oral  xxxd2026xxx  was effective in patients with locally
advanced or metastatic bcc in the multicentre, doubleblind, phase ii bolt trial (nct01327053) [7]. bolt
included patients aged c18 years with locally advanced
bcc not amenable to curative surgery or radiation
(n = 194) or metastatic bcc (n = 36). patients were
randomized to once-daily oral  xxxd2026xxx  200 (n = 79) or
800 mg (n = 151) on a continuous dosing schedule. the
primary endpoint was objective response rate, which is the
percentage of patients who experienced partial shrinkage or
complete disappearance of their tumour(s) with data collected up to 6 months after randomization of the last
patient. the median follow-up was 13.9 months [7].
in the primary efficacy analysis population (patients with
fully assessable locally advanced bcc and all patients with
metastatic bcc), objective response rates, as determined by
blinded central review, were 36 % (95 % 24–50) and 34 %
(95 % 25–43) in the  xxxd2026xxx  200 and 800 mg once daily
groups, respectively [7]. more specifically, 43 % of patients
with locally advanced disease and 15 % of patients with
metastatic disease, in the  xxxd2026xxx  200 mg once daily group,
and 38 % of patients with locally advanced disease and 17 %
of patients with metastatic disease in the  xxxd2026xxx  800 mg
once daily group, achieved an objective response [7].
the median duration of response (dor) in patients with
metastatic disease receiving  xxxd2026xxx  800 mg once daily
was 8.3 months [7]. dor could not be estimated for the
other groups, as the majority of patients who had a
response had had no event at the time of the analysis (event
defined as progression or death due to any cause). the
median progression-free survival (pfs) per central review
for patients with metastatic disease was 13.1 months and
7.6 months in the 200 and 800 mg once daily groups,
respectively. median pfs could not be reached for patients
with locally advanced disease, since the majority had had
no event at the time of analysis. the median time to tumour
response (ttr) per central review for patients with locally
advanced disease was 3.9 months and 3.7 months in the
200 and 800 mg once daily groups, respectively. in
patients with metastatic disease, median ttr was
4.6 months and 1.0 month in the 200 and 800 mg once
daily groups, respectively. in patients with locally

preliminary data from a phase i/ii trial (nct01125800)
suggest that  xxxd2026xxx  was effective in patients with hhactivated relapsed/refractory medulloblastoma, or other
tumours potentially dependent on hh signalling, such as
rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, high
grade glioma or osteosarcoma [24]. in the phase i dose
escalation portion of the trial, 59 children (38 with
medulloblastoma), aged 2–17 (median 12) years, were
treated with  xxxd2026xxx  starting at 372 mg2; the recommended phase ii dose was established as 680 mg/m2 once
daily for children and adolescents. in the phase ii portion,
patients with relapsed/refractory medulloblastoma, including 12 adult patients, were treated at previously established
recommended clinical doses of  xxxd2026xxx  (800 mg once
daily in adults and 680 mg/m2 in children). among patients
with medulloblastoma treated in both phases of the study
(n = 50), three patients had complete responses while
receiving once-daily  xxxd2026xxx  372 mg/m2, 425 mg/m2 or
800 mg/day and one patient had a partial response while
receiving  xxxd2026xxx  800 mg once daily. subsequently,
these patients were found to have hh-activated tumours
(analyzed using a rt-pcr-based five-gene hh signature
assay). one adult and one pediatric patient with hh-activated tumours had stable and progressive disease, respectively. no responses were observed in the patients who
were determined to have tumours not activated by the hh
pathway [24].
2.3.3 myelofibrosis
 xxxd2026xxx  in combination with  xxxd3154xxx  appears to be
effective in patients with myelofibrosis according to the
results of an ongoing phase ib/ii trial (nct01787552) [25].
patients (median age 67 years) with primary or secondary
(post–polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia) intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis with
palpable splenomegaly not previously treated with janus
kinase inhibitors or  xxxg2177xxx  inhibitors received  xxxd2026xxx 
400 mg once daily plus  xxxd3154xxx  10 mg twice daily
(n = 8),  xxxd2026xxx  400 mg once daily plus  xxxd3154xxx 
15 mg twice daily (n = 10) or  xxxd2026xxx  400 mg once
daily plus  xxxd3154xxx  20 mg twice daily (n = 5). at data
cutoff, 65 % of patients achieved a c50 % reduction in
palpable spleen length from baseline and nine patients had
resolution of splenomegaly [25].

 xxxd2026xxx : first global approval

2.3.4 small-cell lung cancer
in an ongoing phase i trial (nct01579929) in patients with
extensive stage small-cell lung cancer receiving etoposide
and cisplatin, oral  xxxd2026xxx  was associated with a partial
response in 50 % of patients (7/14 patients) [26].  xxxd2026xxx 
800 mg once daily was determined as the recommended
phase ii dose when administered with etoposide and cisplatin. in this open-label study, newly diagnosed patients
with extensive small-cell lung cancer (median age
56 years), karnofsky performance status c70 and asymptomatic brain metastases received  xxxd2026xxx  200 mg once
daily (n = 2); 400 mg once daily (n = 7); 800 mg once
daily (n = 5) as capsules. treatment was continued until
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. the first 3

patients were enrolled at 400 mg once daily, and two
experienced a dose limiting toxicity, leading to dose deescalation (200 once daily). three patients received
maintenance  xxxd2026xxx  for c4 months [26].

2.3.5 chronic myeloid leukaemia
a phase ib trial (nct01456676) in patients with in patients
with philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid
leukaemia in chronic phase refractory/intolerant to at least
1 prior  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor (n = 11) demonstrated that
the benefits of adding  xxxd2026xxx  to  xxxd2724xxx  did not outweigh the additional risks [27]. the study was terminated
early due to lack of efficacy [27].

2.4 adverse events
 xxxd2026xxx  was generally well tolerated in patients with
locally advanced or metastatic bcc [4, 7]. in the randomised phase ii bolt trial, grade 3 or 4 adverse events
occurred less frequently in the 200 mg once daily dose
group (30 %) than in the 800 mg once daily group (56 %)
[7]. grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurring in c2 % of
patients in the 200 mg once daily group were elevated
creatine phosphokinase (6 %), increased lipase (5 %), and
hypertension, asthenia and muscle spasms (all 3 %). grade
3 or 4 adverse events reported by c2% of patients in the
800 mg once daily group were elevated creatine phosphokinase (13 %), increased lipase, muscle spasms and
weight loss (all 5 %), decreased appetite (4 %), rhabdomyolysis, nausea, hypertension, increased alanine
aminotransferase and increased aspartate aminotransferase
(all 3 %), and fatigue, syncope, anaemia, dehydration,
hyperkalaemia and myalgia (all 2 %); none of the cases of
rhabdomyolysis reported by investigators was confirmed
by the independent safety review and adjudication committee on muscle toxicity [7].
adverse events leading to dose interruptions or reductions
were reported in 32 % of patients in the 200 mg once daily
group and 60 % of patients in the 800 mg once daily group
[7]. twenty two percent of  xxxd2026xxx  200 mg once daily
recipients and 36 % of  xxxd2026xxx  800 mg once daily recipients, discontinued therapy as a result of adverse events.
serious adverse events were reported in 14 % of patients in
the  xxxd2026xxx  200 mg once daily group and in 30 % of
patients in the  xxxd2026xxx  800 mg once daily group [7].
generally similar patterns of adverse events were
observed in phase i/ii trials in medulloblastoma [24] or
other tumours potentially dependent on hh signaling
pathway such as myelofibrosis [25], chronic myeloid leukemia [27] and extensive stage small-cell lung cancer [26].
the us prescribing information contains a boxed
warning regarding the risk of embryo-fetal death or severe
birth defects when  xxxd2026xxx  is administered to a pregnant
woman [4]. females are advised to use effective contraception during treatment with  xxxd2026xxx  and for at least
20 months after the last dose, and males are advised to use
condoms during treatment and for at least 8 months after
the last dose. the prescribing information also contains
warnings or precautions for musculoskeletal adverse reactions, which may be accompanied by elevated creatine
phosphokinase [4].
2.5 companion diagnostic
genoptix, a subsidiary of novartis, is developing a companion diagnostic for  xxxd2026xxx , to identify medulloblastoma patients with the 5-gene signature that indicates hh

pathway activation. the five-gene hh signature include
 xxxg897xxx ,  xxxg639xxx  1 (sphk1), shroom family
member 2 (shroom2), pdz and lim domain 3
(pdlim3) and orthodenticle homeobox 2 (otx2) [28].
the diagnostic agent will be used as a patient pre-selection
tool. clinical development is underway.
2.6 ongoing clinical trials
2.6.1 basal cell carcinoma
the phase ii bolt trial, which is evaluating the efficacy of
 xxxd2026xxx  in patients with locally advanced or metastatic
bcc, is ongoing (nct01327053); the primary analysis has
been completed (sect. 2.3.1) [7]. additionally, stanford
university, in collaboration with national cancer institute,
has initiated a study (presumably phase ii) to assess the efficacy and safety of  xxxd2026xxx  in combination with  xxxd382xxx  in
patients with locally advanced or metastatic bcc
(nct02303041) and a phase ii trial will investigate the effect
of oral  xxxd2026xxx  in patients with bcc and prior exposure to
hh pathway inhibitors (eudract2012-004113-13).
2.6.2 other malignancies
with regard to other indications, phase ii trials in haematological malignancies are planning to assess the safety and
efficacy of  xxxd2026xxx  in combination with bortezomib in
patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma
(nct02254551). in addition, a phase ii trial
(nct02086552) will evaluate the efficacy of  xxxd2026xxx  in
combination with lenalidomide as maintenance therapy
following autologous stem cell transplantation, in patients
with refractory multiple myeloma and another phase ii
study (nct01826214; eudract2012-004022-21) is being
conducted to evaluate  xxxd2026xxx  in adult patients with
relapsed/refractory acute leukaemia, and in elderly patients
with previously untreated acute leukaemia.
novartis is planning an uncontrolled phase ii trial, to
investigate efficacy and safety of once-daily  xxxd2026xxx  in
patients with metastatic osteosarcoma (cohort 1), metastatic or unresectable chondrosarcoma (cohort 2), or
ewing’s sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumour or
rhabdomyosarcoma (cohort 3) in australia and new
zealand (actrn12612000533897), and is conducting a
multinational phase ii trial to compare the efficacy and
