 xxxd3078xxx 
a novel hypnotic lacking abuse liability and sedative adverse effects
matthew w. johnson, phd; patricia e. suess, phd; roland r. griffiths, phd

context:  xxxd3078xxx  is a novel mt1 and mt2 melatonin
receptor selective agonist recently approved for insomnia treatment. most approved insomnia medications have
potential for abuse and cause motor and cognitive impairment.

well as assessments of a broad range of stimulant and
sedative subjective effects. observer-rated measures included assessments of sedation and impairment. motor
and cognitive performance measures included psychomotor and memory tasks and a standing balance task.

objective: to evaluate the potential for abuse, subjec-

results: compared with placebo,  xxxd3078xxx  (16, 80, and

tive effects, and motor and cognitive–impairing effects
of  xxxd3078xxx  compared with triazolam, a classic benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic drug.
design: in this double-blind crossover study, each par-

ticipant received oral doses of  xxxd3078xxx  (16, 80, or 160
mg), triazolam (0.25, 0.5, or 0.75 mg), and placebo during approximately 18 days. all participants received each
treatment on different days. most outcome measures were
assessed at 0.5 hours before drug administration and repeatedly up to 24 hours after drug administration.
setting: residential research facility.
participants: fourteen adults with histories of seda-

tive abuse.
main outcome measures: subject-rated measures included items relevant to potential for abuse (eg, drug liking, street value, and pharmacological classification), as

160 mg) showed no significant effect on any of the subjective effect measures, including those related to potential for abuse. in the pharmacological classification, 79%
(11/14) of subjects identified the highest dose of  xxxd3078xxx  as placebo. similarly, compared with placebo,  xxxd3078xxx  had no effect at any dose on any observer-rated
or motor and cognitive performance measure. in contrast, triazolam showed dose-related effects on a wide
range of subject-rated, observer-rated, and motor and cognitive performance measures, consistent with its profile
as a sedative drug with abuse liability.
conclusion:  xxxd3078xxx  demonstrated no significant effects indicative of potential for abuse or motor and cognitive impairment at up to 20 times the recommended
therapeutic dose and may represent a useful alternative
to existing insomnia medications.

nsomnia is the inability to fall

or remain asleep or the experience of nonrestorative sleep, resulting in clinically significant distress or adverse consequences on
daytime functioning.1 this disorder is prevalent, with 10% to 15% of adults having
chronic insomnia and another 25% to 35%
experiencing occasional insomnia.2,3 the
most common pharmacological agents used
in the treatment of insomnia are ␥- xxxd2177xxx  type a (gabaa) modulators acting at the benzodiazepine recognition site
(ie, benzodiazepine receptor agonists) (eg,
zolpidem tartrate,  xxxd2047xxx , temazepam, and triazolam).4,5 these compounds
produce several problematic effects that increase the risk of inappropriate use and restrict the populations in which they may be
safely prescribed.5

first, benzodiazepine receptor agonists are known to be used nonmedically
(ie, abused), particularly by individuals
with a history of substance abuse.6-9 second, these compounds can engender
cognitive impairments, most prominently anterograde amnesia.10-14 third,
these agents can produce motor impairments (eg, poor driving performance15,16
and falls in older persons17,18). fourth,
benzodiazepine receptor agonists can
produce a withdrawal syndrome on discontinuation of long-term use of therapeutic or higher doses.8,15,19 withdrawal
symptoms include rebound insomnia,
anxiety, irritability, headache, gastrointestinal disturbance, depersonalization,
perceptual changes, and, in severe cases,
seizures and delirium.6 pharmacological
agents without such problematic effects

could provide a valuable alternative for the treatment of
insomnia.
because of concern about abuse, dependence, and
withdrawal, physicians are frequently discouraged from
prescribing benzodiazepine receptor agonists to patients
with a history of substance abuse or dependence.8,20,21
the 2005 physicians’ desk reference, for example, provides the following caution to physicians when prescribing the benzodiazepine receptor agonist zolpidem:
“because persons with a history of addiction to, or
abuse of, drugs or alcohol are at increased risk of
habituation and dependence, they should be under
careful surveillance when receiving zolpidem or any
[italics added] other hypnotic.”22(p2982) compliance with
such recommendations is difficult considering that 46%
of the us population reports some use of illicit drugs
during their lifetimes and 9% meet criteria for past-year
abuse of or dependence on any illicit drug or alcohol.23
furthermore, patients may not disclose such histories
of nonmedical use.
 xxxd3078xxx , an agent recently approved for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty with sleep
onset, is a novel mt1 and mt2 melatonin receptor selective agonist and has minimal affinity for other sites implicated in potential for abuse and impairment, such as
benzodiazepine receptors, dopamine receptors, opiate receptors, ion channels, and various receptor transporters.24 the mt1 and mt2 receptors are located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and are
involved in maintaining the circadian sleep-wake cycle.25
in double-blind studies26-29 analyzing doses from 4 to 64
mg,  xxxd3078xxx  was efficacious in reducing latency to persistent sleep and, although less consistently, in increasing total sleep time in individuals with and without
chronic insomnia.
evidence to date suggests that  xxxd3078xxx  administration may lack several of the problematic effects associated with benzodiazepine receptor agonists used in treating insomnia. in preclinical studies of rhesus monkeys,
 xxxd3078xxx  was found to have no reinforcing effect in an
intravenous drug self-administration procedure,30 was
similar to the vehicle in a benzodiazepine vs vehicle drug
discrimination procedure,31 and showed no evidence of
withdrawal symptoms during intermittent abstinence periods throughout 1 year of administration.32 in clinical
trials in subjects with chronic insomnia,  xxxd3078xxx  treatment was not associated with rebound insomnia or with
withdrawal symptoms after 5 weeks of treatment.27,29 furthermore, in studies26,28 of subjects with and without
chronic insomnia,  xxxd3078xxx  did not produce cognitive
or memory impairment when assessed about 9 hours after administration.
the potential for abuse and motor- and cognitiveimpairing effects of  xxxd3078xxx  at supratherapeutic doses has
not been evaluated in humans. the present study used welldeveloped methods for assessing potential for abuse and
impairing effects of novel agents at supratherapeutic doses
in persons with histories of substance abuse.33 specifically, subjects who abused sedative drugs were studied using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-effect, crossover design, with triazolam as a positive control.

methods

subjects
healthy men and nonpregnant and nonlactating women between 18 and 60 years of age without a current clinically significant medical or psychiatric condition other than substance
abuse or dependence were eligible to participate in this study.
subjects fulfilled criteria for dsm-iv current or past psychoactive substance abuse or dependence and reported nonmedical use of a sedative drug within the last year. on enrollment,
subjects were required to have a negative urine drug screen,
demonstrate negative test results for breath ethanol, and show
no signs or symptoms of drug withdrawal. subjects with abnormal findings on physical or clinical laboratory evaluations
were excluded. subjects gave their written informed consent
before beginning the study and were paid for their participation. the western institutional review board of olympia, wash,
approved this study.

procedures
this study was conducted following general procedures similar to those described previously.34,35 research subjects resided on a 14-bed research unit for approximately 18 days. for
a few days before and throughout the study, subjects were given
a caffeine-free diet but were allowed to smoke tobacco cigarettes except when engaged in experimental procedures. subjects and research staff were instructed that possible drugs to
be tested included sedatives, anesthetics, muscle relaxants, antipsychotics, antianxiety drugs, antihistamines, analgesics, stimulants, weight loss medications, and placebo. subjects were also
told that they would receive  xxxd3078xxx  (identified as  xxxd3078xxx ), an investigational drug being evaluated for treatment of
sleep disorders. subjects were told that the objective of the study
was to learn more about the effects of drugs on mood and performance during various tasks. no instructions were provided
as to what outcomes might be expected.
during the days in which sessions were conducted, subjects were required to remain in the dayroom of the residential unit from 6:45 am until 5 pm. subjects ate a small, low-fat
breakfast, which was finished at least 1.5 hours before drug administration. no additional food was allowed until after 12:45
pm. subjects ingested study medications orally at approximately 8:45 am. as described in more detail herein, various measures were assessed 0.5 hours before drug administration and
repeatedly up to 24 hours after drug administration.
sessions were conducted every day except weekends and
holidays. before the first experimental session, subjects completed practice sessions for the purpose of training and adaptation to procedures; no placebo or drug was administered
during practice sessions. next, subjects completed 2 singleblind session days to determine if they liked alprazolam, a
commonly abused sedative drug, more than placebo. on the
first and second days, subjects received 3 mg of alprazolam
and placebo, respectively, in a cherry-flavored solution. all
prospective subjects had to report higher ratings of drug liking (next-day questionnaire, described herein) after taking
alprazolam than placebo. subjects then participated in 7 session days during which they were exposed to each of the following 7 double-blind drug conditions (1 condition per session) in random order: (1) placebo, (2) 16 mg of  xxxd3078xxx ,
(3) 80 mg of  xxxd3078xxx , (4) 160 mg of  xxxd3078xxx , (5) 0.25
mg of triazolam, (6) 0.5 mg of triazolam, and (7) 0.75 mg of
triazolam. a final session was designated as the reinforcement session from the drug vs money choice procedure
(described herein).

five tablets, 3 capsules, and 180 ml of solution were
administered in each experimental session. drugs and placebos were identical in appearance and were supplied by takeda pharmaceuticals north america, lincolnshire, ill.
 xxxd3078xxx  was supplied as 16-mg and 32-mg tablets (identical in appearance). placebo tablets contained lactose monohydrate. triazolam (manufactured by greenstone, ltd,
kalamazoo, mich) was supplied in capsules (size 0) containing 0.25 mg of triazolam each. placebo capsules contained
microcrystalline cellulose. alprazolam (1 mg/ml) (manufactured by roxane laboratories, inc, columbus, ohio) was
supplied as a colorless, oral solution. cherry-flavored water
was added to the  xxxd122xxx . the placebo solution
was cherry-flavored water.
except as indicated herein, subject-rated, observer-rated, and
motor and cognitive performance measures were assessed at
0.5 hours before drug administration and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12,
and 24 hours after drug administration. subject-rated and observer-rated measures were also obtained at 0.5 hours after drug
administration. the following measures were assessed at a single
time point after drug administration: addiction research center inventory, word recall and recognition task, next-day
questionnaire, and drug vs money choice procedure.

subject-rated
and observer-rated measures
unless otherwise stated, all questionnaires regarding subjectrated and observer-rated measures were administered on a desktop computer. the subject or staff member used a computer
mouse to point to and select one of the various response options displayed on the screen.

subjective effect questionnaire
and pharmacological class questionnaire
the subjective effect questionnaire consisted of 2 parts. the
first part asked subjects to rate their present level of alertness
or sleepiness on a visual analog scale. the second part asked
subjects to rate 34 subjective effect items using a 5-point scale.36
the pharmacological class questionnaire asked subjects to categorize the drug effect as being most similar to 1 of 14 classes
of psychoactive drugs.12

next-day questionnaire
the 7-item next-day questionnaire, completed approximately 24 hours after drug administration, asked subjects to
rate the overall effects of yesterday’s drug.36 one item was a pharmacological class question similar to the pharmacological class
questionnaire.

drug effect questionnaire
and addiction research center inventory
the drug effect questionnaire asked subjects to rate drug
strength on a 5-point scale and drug liking on a 9-point bidirectional scale.37 the addiction research center inventory (short
form) questionnaire, completed 2 hours after drug administration, asked subjects 49 true-or-false questions and resulted
in 5 scales of drug effects.38,39

drug vs money choice procedure
and observer-rated questionnaire
the drug vs money choice procedure, a contingency-based
paper questionnaire, assessed the monetary value of each

(reprinted) arch gen psychiatry/ vol 63, oct 2006
1151

drug condition. 40,41 the observer-rated questionnaire 36
asked a trained research staff member to rate 7 aspects of a
subject’s gross behavior on a 5-point scale. the observer also
estimated the number of minutes the subject slept during
the past hour. the research staff member making the rating
generally observed the subject for the entire time frame
being rated, although for brief periods the participant was
not observed.

motor and cognitive
performance measures
digit symbol substitution test, balance task,
and circular lights task
a computerized version of the digit symbol substitution
test (dsst) assessed subjects’ ability to use a numeric keypad to enter a geometric pattern associated with 1 of 9 digits
displayed on a video screen.36,42 the balance task, a motor
task, assessed subjects’ ability to stand upright on 1 foot
with the eyes closed and arms extended to the side at shoulder height. 36 the circular lights task, a motor task,
assessed subjects’ ability to make hand-eye coordinated
movements. subjects pressed a series of 16 buttons as rapidly as possible in response to a randomly sequenced illumination of lights.36

enter and recall task
and word recall and recognition task
the enter and recall task short-term memory task assessed
subjects’ recall of 8 randomly selected digits.36 the word recall and recognition task explicit memory task assessed recall and recognition 6 hours after drug administration of words
presented 2 hours after drug administration.43

statistical analysis
motor and cognitive performance measures were analyzed as
a percentage of the predrug score, except for the word
recall and recognition task, which was measured at a
single time point. subject-rated and observer-rated measures, as well as the word recall and recognition task
items, were analyzed as absolute scores (ie, not as percentages of the predrug scores). for each measure assessed at
multiple time points, peak effect data were determined for
each participant by selecting the highest postdrug score
among all postdrug time points. for motor and cognitive
performance measures, the lowest score served as the peak
effect score. for the subjective effect questionnaire and the
next-day questionnaire, separate drug-liking and drugdisliking scores were analyzed as described previously.36
time-course data were analyzed by repeated-measures
2-factor analysis of variance with condition (7 drug conditions) and time (postdrug time points) as factors. tukey
honestly significant difference tests were used to compare
each active drug condition with placebo at each time point.
other analyses consisted of 1-factor analyses of variance
using drug condition as a factor. these analyses were performed on addiction research center inventory scales,
next-day questionnaire items, word recall and recognition task measures, drug vs money choice procedure, and
peak effects for other measures. tukey honestly significant
difference tests were then used to compare each of the 7
drug conditions with each other. for all statistical tests,
pⱕ.05 was considered significant.

results

the subjects enrolled were 14 adult volunteers (1 woman; 2 black and 12 white), with a mean age of 28 years
(age range, 19-50 years) and a mean weight of 77 kg
(range, 56-109 kg). subjects reported a history of recreational use of a wide range of substances, including sedatives, during the previous year. eleven subjects reported regular use of tobacco cigarettes.
time course of drug effects
triazolam, but not  xxxd3078xxx , produced orderly doserelated and time-related effects. figure 1 shows timecourse data for the following 4 representative measures:
drug strength (from the drug effect questionnaire), drug
liking (from the drug effect questionnaire), the dsst,
and the circular lights task. for most measures significantly affected by triazolam, the highest dose (0.75 mg)
resulted in scores that were significantly different from
placebo at the first time point measured (0.5 or 1 hour
after drug administration). the mean maximal effects for
measures significantly affected by triazolam usually occurred at 1 hour after drug administration, although the
maximal effects were observed at 2 hours after drug administration for some measures. measures significantly
affected by triazolam typically returned to baseline (ie,
were not significantly different from placebo) at 3 or 4
hours after drug administration, although some measures returned to baseline at 6 hours after drug administration. in contrast, for no measure did any dose of  xxxd3078xxx  result in scores significantly different from
placebo at any time point.
subject-rated measures
the table summarizes significant subject-rated measures based on post hoc comparisons. for 19 of 20 subjectrated measures, at least 1 triazolam dose resulted in significant differences from placebo in the direction of greater
drug strength, potential for abuse, or typical sedative drug
effects. an exception was that the 0.5-mg dose significantly decreased ratings for the subjective effect questionnaire item regarding headache. no dose of  xxxd3078xxx  resulted in scores that were significantly different from
placebo for any subject-rated measure. furthermore, for
14 of the subject-rated measures in the table, the highest dose of triazolam (0.75 mg) resulted in significantly
greater ratings of drug strength, potential for abuse, or
typical sedative drug effects compared with the highest
dose of  xxxd3078xxx  (160 mg). the top 4 graphs in figure 2
show that triazolam, but not  xxxd3078xxx , resulted in doserelated peak effects for the 2 representative subjectrated measures (drug strength and drug liking) in figure 1.
the pharmacological class question in the next-day
questionnaire revealed that subjects generally classified  xxxd3078xxx  as placebo at all doses, whereas classifications of triazolam as placebo decreased with increasing dose. the highest dose of  xxxd3078xxx  (160 mg) was
classified by 11 (79%) of 14 subjects as placebo, whereas
the highest dose of triazolam (0.75 mg) was rated as pla(reprinted) arch gen psychiatry/ vol 63, oct 2006

comment

the objective of this study was to provide information relevant to the potential for abuse and the impairing effects
of  xxxd3078xxx  at supratherapeutic doses relative to those of
triazolam, a classic benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic drug
with known potential for abuse and impairing effects. a
range of  xxxd3078xxx  doses (16, 80, and 160 mg) resulted in
no statistically significant effects on several measures. these
doses were up to 20 times the recommended therapeutic
dose (8 mg) that has been shown to be efficacious for improving sleep outcomes in adult and older adult subjects
with chronic insomnia.26,27,29 in contrast, triazolam resulted in significant dose-related changes indicative of potential for abuse and motor and cognitive impairment, consistent with the findings of previous studies35,37,43-45 in
subjects with histories of sedative drug abuse and healthy
volunteers, demonstrating the dose-dependent sensitivity
and validity of the procedures used.
the apparent lack of potential for abuse of  xxxd3078xxx 
stands in contrast to the abuse liability of existing hypnotic agents that are benzodiazepine receptor agonists. studies similar in design to the present study have documented potential for abuse for many of these compounds
(eg, zolpidem,44 lorazepam,46 triazolam,35 oxazepam,47 and
zaleplon12). abuse liability is an important consideration
for physicians that may sometimes be overlooked.20,21 recreational abuse of benzodiazepine receptor agonists occurs most frequently among polydrug abusers and is generally characterized by the motivation to “get high,” use
of supratherapeutic doses, ingestion in combination with
other drugs (eg, opioids and alcohol), and procurement from
illicit sources.6,48-53 associated problems include the legal
and health risks associated with involvement in the illicit
drug culture, as well as motor and cognitive impairment
and withdrawal syndrome.6,49-51,53 findings from the present study suggest that recreational abuse and associated adverse consequences are unlikely with  xxxd3078xxx .
the absence of motor and cognitive impairment after  xxxd3078xxx  ingestion in the present study contrasts with
findings from previous studies demonstrating impairing effects after administration of a range of hypnotic
drugs, including benzodiazepine receptor agonists (eg,
zolpidem,44 lorazepam,46 triazolam,35 oxazepam,47 and zaleplon12) and other compounds (eg, pentobarbital sodium,35  xxxd1906xxx ,54 and trazodone hydrochloride55). previous results of sleep efficacy
investigations of  xxxd3078xxx  are consistent with the present study in finding no motor or cognitive–impairing effects. one study28 that investigated the effects of up to
64 mg of  xxxd3078xxx  found no effect on next-morning (9
hours after drug administration) dsst scores; an  xxxd1706xxx (reprinted) arch gen psychiatry/ vol 63, oct 2006
1155

plained finding is that next-morning subjective ratings
of alertness and ability to concentrate were significantly
reduced at the highest dose (64 mg). another study,26
which investigated the effects of up to 32 mg of  xxxd3078xxx , found no effect on next-morning (about 9 hours after drug administration) dsst scores, memory recall, and
subjective ratings of alertness and ability to concentrate. the apparent absence of potential for abuse and
the lack of impairing effects of  xxxd3078xxx  compared with
other hypnotic agents likely relate to differences in mechanisms of action. the localized effect of  xxxd3078xxx  on mt1
and mt2 receptors24 contrasts with the widespread effects throughout the central nervous system of gaba–
mediated hypnotic agents.56
in conclusion, the present results demonstrated no significant effects indicative of potential for abuse or motor and cognitive impairment for  xxxd3078xxx  at doses up
to 20 times the recommended therapeutic dose of 8 mg.
in combination with findings from previous studies supporting its efficacy in reducing sleep latency,26-29 increasing total sleep,26,28 and limiting interference with sleep
architecture,26,28 as well as its apparent lack of rebound
insomnia and withdrawal symptoms,27,29 our study results (indicating no evidence of potential for abuse or impairing effects) suggest that  xxxd3078xxx  may fill an unmet need in the treatment of insomnia. although further
clinical trials are warranted,  xxxd3078xxx  may be particularly useful for the treatment of insomnia in individuals
with histories of substance abuse, in older subjects (who
are especially susceptible to the impairing effects of benzodiazepine receptor agonists), and in persons requiring minimal interference with arousal response (eg, oncall workers and patients with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease). furthermore,  xxxd3078xxx  may be a
safe first-line medication even in individuals not reporting substance abuse, given that some individuals may not
admit to such misuse. finally, the selective pharmacological action of melatonin receptor agonists represents
a novel target for a new class of hypnotic agents57 that
may be devoid of potential for abuse and impairment.
