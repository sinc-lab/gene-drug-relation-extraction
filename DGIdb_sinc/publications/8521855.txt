2-chloro-2’-deoxyadenosine ( xxxd1712xxx ), a nucleoside that has proven useful in the treatment of several
chronic lymphoid malignancies, and its analogue, 2-bromo-2‘-deoxyadenosine, are both effective inhibitors of the bacterial (escherichia coli) purine- xxxg1792xxx  (pnp), with k, values of 4.5 pm
and 6.3 pm, respectively. the examination of a series of base-modified analogues of  xxxd1712xxx  has shown
that several other compounds have similar inhibitor properties, and has indicated that 6-benzyloxy-2chloro-9-(2’-deoxy-~-~-ribofuranosyl)purine
is the most potent inhibitor with a k, value of 0.5 pm, competitive with respect to inosine (ino).
 xxxd1712xxx  itself and its base-modified analogues, discounting those substituted at c(8), are also substrates for the e. coli pnp and undergo rapid glycosidic bond cleavage.  xxxd1712xxx  is degraded with substrate
efficiency, i.e. v,,,,,ik,, similar to that observed for ino (130 %i), although the individual kinetic constants,
k,,, and v,,,, are both approximately an order of magnitude lower than for ino.
all compounds tested are totally inactive as substrates and inhibitors for mammalian (calf spleen)
pnp and therefore constitute a new class of potent selective, although cleavable, inhibitors of bacterial
phosphorylases.
8-bromo-2-chloro-2’-deoxyadenosine and 8-thio-2-chloro-2’-deoxyadenosine
are the only base-modified  xxxd1712xxx  derivatives showing inhibitory activity against molt-3 (acute t-cell leukemia) and u-937
(histiocytic lymphoma) cells and, as shown in this study, are resistant to degradation by e. coli pnp. the
above-mentioned results suggest that both analogues could be effective as oral cytotoxic agents that are
noncleavable by enteric bacteria.

the drug is usually applied intravenously or orally [5]. it
was reported that  xxxd1712xxx  is unstable in acid [6] and degraded
(phosphorolysed) to 2-chloroadenine and deoxyribose l-phosphate by purine- xxxg1792xxx  (pnp) of enteric bacteria (escherichia coli) [7], although no detailed enzymic data
were reported. due to the above-mentioned ways of degradation
of  xxxd1712xxx  in the human digestion system, the oral administration of this drug is not very effective. consequently, it would be
very useful to find modifications of  xxxd1712xxx  that will make this
drug more resistant to acid hydrolysis and enzymic phosphorolysis of its glycosidic bond and, at the same time, will not cancel
or
markedly reduce its cytotoxic activity.

2-chloro-2’-deoxyadenosine ( xxxd1712xxx , cladribine,  xxxd1712xxx )
is an adenosine-deaminase-resistant nucleoside that has been
used for treatment of hairy cell leukemia and other hematological malignancies [i, 21. the therapeutical potential of cladribine
has recently been extended to autoimmunoaggressive diseases
such as multiple sclerosis 131.
the metabolic pathways of this drug have not been clarified
up to now. it is known, however, that cladribine is phosphorylated to its 5‘-monophosphate by human  xxxg611xxx

the purine bases were obtained by acid hydrolysis of the
glycosidic bond of appropriate nucleosides, and by independent
chemical synthesis according to known procedures [12].
ultraviolet spectroscopy was performed with a kontron (vienna, austria) uvikon 940 ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer
fitted with thermostatically controlled cell compartments and
using 5-mm path-length cuvettes. the concentrations of substrates and inhibitors were determined spectrophotometrically
from their molar absorption coefficients [ 10, 131. thin-layer
chromatography was performed on silica gel plates with the
solvent consisting of 9 : 1 (by vol.) dichloromethane/methanol.
enzymic procedures. in preliminary experiments, all compounds were tested for inhibitory activity at a concentration of
at least 100 pm versus both calf spleen and e. coli enzymes
with inosine as substrate. inhibition was measured at 25”c, in
50 mm sodium phosphate, ph 7, and the inosine concentration
was 90 pm. phosphorolysis was monitored spectrophotometrically by coupling to the  xxxg2431xxx  reaction [14]. it was
independently established that none of the compounds, at a concentration used in the reaction with pnp, affected the xanthine
oxidase activity.
the initial velocity of phosphorolysis was calculated by linear regression analysis of plots of absorbance versus time, where
v, is the initial velocity of phosphorolysis with no inhibitor
added and v, is the initial velocity in the presence of an analogue.
inhibition constants were determined only for analogues showing in the preliminary experiments at least 50% reduction of the
initial velocity, i.e. v , / v ,< 0.5.
inhibition constants. since most of the nucleosides tested
as inhibitors of e. coli pnp show also substrate activity with
this enzyme, the initial velocity method was employed to determine the inhibition constants. this method allows the decrease
of inhibitor concentration during the reaction due to phosphorolysis and the inhibition by the cleavage products (i.e. the respective purine base and deoxyribose 1-phosphate) to be avoided.
inhibition constants were obtained for at least three different
concentrations of inhibitor, using kinetic parameters for inosine
as standards [15, 161. the k:pp and v:: for phosphorolysis in
the presence of inhibitor were determined by linear regression
analysis from eadie-hofstee plots of v, versus v,/c,. the inhibition constants were calculated from the following equations

results and discussion
inhibitor properties. the experimentally determined values of
k, for inhibition of the 8. coli pnp by  xxxd1712xxx , brdado, and
their analogues are listed in table 1. discounting 8-substituted
 xxxd1712xxx  analogues (compounds
which exhibited no inhibition at concentrations up to 100 pm, and 6-ethoxy-cldpu
(compound 3b),
which shows only a weak effect at this concentration, inhibition of active cornpounds was in all instances competitive with regard to tno as substrate and inhibition constants
were in the range 0.5- i3 pm.
the most potent inhibition was observed for compound 2,
i.e. 6-benzyloxy-cldpu, k, = 0.52 pm, a value close to k, =
0.3 pm obtained for the most effective inhibitor of e. coli pnp
discovered up to now, i.e. the neutral form of n(6)-methylformycin 1161. inhibition by & seems to be competitive with
respect to lno. although it was not possible to examine the effect
of the inhibitor at a concentration > 10 k , (i.e. 5 pm) due to
inhibition of  xxxg2431xxx  employed in the coupled assay
for pnp activity 1131.
fig. 1 presents the kinetics of inhibition of e. coli pnp by
n"-benzyl- xxxd1712xxx ,the second most potent competitive inhibitor
( k , = 1.9 pm). similar eadie-hofstee plots were observed for
all other active compounds and typical values of k, were i n the
n6order of several micromolar ('table 1). only compound
cyclohexyl- xxxd1712xxx . with a bulky w substituent, shows a higher
k,, 13 pm, a value still several fold lower than the michaelis
constants for natural substrates of the e. coli enzyme (47 pm
for ino).
among all n"- and 0"-substituted analogues of  xxxd1712xxx , only
6-ethoxy-cldpu (&) shows very weak inhibitory activity. this
result was surprising. it is clear from the data presented in this
study that there is a specific interaction of a substituent placed
at the c(6) position of the base with the binding site of the
enzyme molecule, although our series of analogues is not broad
enough to identify the nature of this interaction with the aid of

a,

structure/activity and quantitative structudactivity relationships. therefore, we plan to extend the study to include a series
of derivatives substituted at c(6) with groups with different hydrophobic, steric and electronic properties.
the active analogues, i.e. la, lb, 2a-2d and 2-kwere
also tested for inhibition of the mammalian (calf spleen) pnp
and were totally inactive at a concentration up to 150 pm (except for 6-benzyloxy-cldpu that was tested only at a concentration of 5 pm due to inhibition of  xxxg2431xxx , see above).
this is in agreement with the fundamental difference between
mammalian and bacterial phosphorylases, i.e. the requirement of
the former, but not the latter, for 0" and n(1)h of the purine
base moiety to form the hydrogen bonds with the binding site
of the enzyme [15, is].

substrate properties. carson et a]. [7] reported rapid degradation of  xxxd1712xxx  by e. coli pnp but kinetic constants for the
enzymic reaction have not been determined. table 2 presents
michaelis constants (k,) and maximal velocities (v,,,,,) for phosphorolysis of  xxxd1712xxx  and its three analogues: two active inhibitors 2, n'-benzyl- xxxd1712xxx  and &, 6-methoxy-cldpu, and one
weak inhibitor, i.e. 3b,6-ethoxy-cldpu. it is observed that the
k,,, values for potent inhibitors are similar to the appropriate
inhibition constants (k,) and are at least an order of magnitude
lower than for the natural substrate, ino. the maximal velocities
(vmj are in the range 1s-2o0/o of that for ino, so the substrate
efficiency i.e. the pseudo first-order rate constant, v,,,,ik,,, is
130% for la,400% for 2 and 340% for 3,
as compared to
100% for ino.
for the weak inhibitor 6-cthoxy-cldpu (3b)
the
, michaelis
constant was several fold higher than for ino, but it was partially
compensated by similar v,,,,,as observed for ino (88%), so the
substrate efficiency, v,,,,,/k,,,, is not very low, i.e. 27% of that
for ino.
for all other nucleosides that were active as inhibitors (&,
&-2d, 3c), phosphorolysis catalyzed by the e. coli pnp was
demonstrated by tlc (see table 2) but kinetic constants were
not determined. in all cases. the products of phosphorolysis (the
parent purine analogue) were identified, both spectrophotometrically and by tlc, against the sample obtained by acid hydroiysis of the glycosidic bond of the appropriate nucleoside. the
lack of substrate activity of %substituted  xxxd1712xxx  analogues
with e. coli pnp, and all analogues with the calf spleen
enzyme, was demonstrated by tlc (table 2).

conclusion
the present experiments demonstrate that  xxxd1712xxx  is degraded by enteric bacterial (e. coli) pnp with substrate efficiency, i.e. v,,,,,/k,, similar to that observed for ino (130%),
although the individual kinetic constants k,, and v,,,,, are both
approximately an order of magnitude lower than that for ino.
from all base modifications tested, only 8-substitution makes
the analogue resistant for binding to the active site of the e.
coli pnp and therefore glycosidic bond cleavage. all other base
modifications do not cancel the substrate and inhibitory activities of an analogue and some of the changes even enhance both
the binding potency and/or substrate effciency (i.e. 6-benzyloxyand w-benzyl-substitution).
however, active inhibitors of the e. coli pnp are totally inactive versus mammalian phosphorylase, so only the enteric bacteria are responsible for the enzymic degradation of orally administrated  xxxd1712xxx . it should be noted that two 8-substituted
 xxxd1712xxx  analogues, i.e. 8-br- xxxd1712xxx  and 8-thio-cldad0, are the
only base-modified  xxxd1712xxx  derivatives showing inhibitory activity against molt-3 (acute t-cell leukemia) and u-937 (histiocytic lymphoma) cells [lo, 111. collectively with the data presented here, i.e. that both analogues are totally inactive as substrates of the e. coli pnp, these results suggest that 8-br- xxxd1712xxx 
and 8-thio- xxxd1712xxx  could be effective as oral cytotoxic agents
that are noncleavable by enteric bacteria.
the present study also identified a new class of potent, selective, although cleavable, inhibitors of e coli pnp that do not
affect mammalian pnp. it is known that several other enzymes
isolated from microorganisms and responsible for glycosidic
bond cleavage of purine-nucleosides, have similar specificity as
e. coli pnp, i.e. are able to split ribonucleosides and 2'-deoxyribonucleosides of adenine, either in the phosphorolytic reaction
(sulmonellu typhimurium, [19, 201, enterohucter uerogenes
[21], mycoplasma [22]), or in the hydrolytic reaction (leislzmunia donovuni [23]).as some of these microorganisms cause
human and animal diseases, their potent selective inhibitors will
provide opportunities for selective toxicity and therefore effective chemotherapy. consequently, it seems useful to search for

the noncleavable inhibitors (i.e. without substrate activity for
phosphorylases from microorganisms) by introducing such modifications as a 7-deaza [is, 241 or a c-c glycosidic bond [16,
251, to the inhibitors described in the present study. furthermore,
it would be also worthwhile to check whether the cleavage products of the nucleosides used in this study, i.e. the respective
purine bases, are also potent inhibitors of bacterial pnp. we plan
to extend our studies to include these possibilities.
we are indebted to dr. g. koszalka for a generous gift of e. coli
pnp, to l. magnowska for excellent technical assistance, and to dr.
wieslaw kawczynski for the idea of this study. this investigation profited from the committee for scientific research (kbn) grants 6 p04a
