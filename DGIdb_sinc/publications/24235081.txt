introduction
chronic kidney disease–mineral and bone disorder (ckd–
mbd) is a systemic disorder of mineral and bone metabolism
due to ckd. secondary hyperparathyroidism (shpt) is a
common feature of ckd–mbd and is characterized by increased
serum  xxxg1885xxx  (pth) levels, hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia and decreased serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
d (1,25(oh)2 vitamin d) levels [1, 2]. standard treatment of
shpt in ckd–mbd has relied upon combinations of various
vitamin d sterols and dietary phosphate binders to normalize
serum calcium reduce hyperphosphatemia and serum pth.
exogenously administered calcitriol or its bioactive analogues
reduce serum pth levels. however, they promote hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, limiting an effective dose that
can be given safely [3]. thus, standard treatment of shpt in
ckd–mbd is often not sufﬁciently effective to manage serum
pth levels on a long-term basis.
a major advance in the management of shpt in dialysis
patients was achieved with the introduction of allosteric calcimimetics [4]. these are the ﬁrst agents that lower serum pth
without increasing the concentrations of serum calcium and

subjects
the clinical study protocol informed consent document
and all other appropriate study related documents were reviewed and approved by the alfred ethics committee melbourne, australia. written informed consent was obtained
from each subject prior to enrollment. a total of 32 healthy
males aged 18–45 years were enrolled. exclusion criteria included any chronic or acute illness, mental or legal incapacitation, participation in another clinical trial within the last
8 weeks, recent excessive alcohol or illicit drug use and any
clinically signiﬁcant abnormalities upon screening clinical
examination or laboratory safety tests.
study design
the study was a double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled, single-dose, dose-escalation study in healthy young
males conducted at a single center (nucleus network,
melbourne, australia). four cohorts enrolled eight subjects
each and were randomized 6:2 to  xxxd3499xxx  or placebo. the
ﬁrst cohort was treated with  xxxd3499xxx  0.5 mg and the dose
was escalated through 2, 5 and 10 mg following review of
safety data from the prior cohort. subjects were admitted to
phase 1 unit 24 h prior to dosing and were observed for 48 h
postdose in the phase 1 unit. all subjects were dosed within a
3.25-h period in the morning allowing pooling of the placebo
subjects across cohorts.  xxxd3499xxx  or 0.9% saline placebo
was administered intravenously over 30–60 s. adverse events

k.j. martin et al.

(ae) were monitored through 48 h after study drug administration and serious adverse events were monitored through
day 7. dose escalation was stopped at the 10 mg dose level.
hematology, coagulation, chemistry, urinalysis, physical
examinations, vital signs and 12-lead ecgs were monitored
during the study. continuous ecg monitoring by telemetry
was performed for cohort 1 only.
subjects were fasted except for water at least 10 h prior to
the collection of blood samples at predose, and at hour 24 and
48 postdose and for 2 h after study drug administration.
a standard diet was provided for the duration of the subject’s
stay on the phase 1 unit. meals or snacks were not offered
within 2 h prior to hour 12 blood collection.
blood was obtained prior to dosing and every 2–6 h following dosing for 48 h and processed to serum, and stored at
−70°c.
timed urine collection
urine was collected for determination of tubular reabsorption of calcium and phosphorus. timed urine collection was
done in 12-h intervals beginning 24 h (± 30 min) prior to
study drug administration and continued through 48 h after
study drug administration at six 12-h intervals. the following
equations were used to calculate tubular reabsorption of
calcium and phosphorus: tubular reabsorption of calcium =
[total serum calcium × 0.59 − (uca × scr/ucr)]/(1 − 0.08 log
[total sca × 0.59/(uca × sca/uca)]); and tubular reabsorption of
phosphorus = [sp − (up × scr/ucr)]/(1 − 0.1 log[sp/(up × scr/
ucr)]) [10].
biochemical methods
all samples were assayed at central laboratories for intact
 xxxg1885xxx  (ipth) using the electrochemiluminescence immunoassy on the roche elecsys® analyzer (normal
range 15–65 pg/ml), fgf23 using fgf23 elisa kit, (kainos
labs, tokyo), calcitonin using immulite® 2000 (siemens
healthcare, llanberis, gwynedd, uk) (normal range: 0–8.3
pg/ml) and 1,25(oh)2 vitamin d using gamma-b 1,25(oh)2
vitamin d radioimmunoassay (immunodiagnostics systems ltd,
scottsdale, az) (normal range: 17.5–70.4 pg/ml) according to
vendor’s instructions. blood was collected into heparin evacuated tubes and ionized calcium (ica) analyzed within 10 min
utilizing the i-stat system (abbott labs; normal range: 1.12–
1.32 mmol/l).
pharmacokinetics assessments
blood samples for pk assessment were drawn predose, at 5,
10, 15, 20 and 30 min, and at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36
and 48 h postdose. blood samples were collected into
k2edta tubes and processed to plasma within 30 min and
stored at −70°c. plasma samples were analyzed for levels of
 xxxd3499xxx  using a validated liquid chromatography/mass
spectrometry method. the lower limit of quantiﬁcation of the
assay was 0.2 ng/ml.
noncompartmental methods of analysis using winnonlin,
version 5.2 (pharsight corp, mountain view, ca), were used
to estimate the pharmacokinetic parameters of  xxxd3499xxx .

phosphorus [5]. calcimimetics act as modulators of the
 xxxg343xxx  ( xxxg343xxx ) [4]. the  xxxg343xxx , a g-protein
coupled receptor, enables the parathyroid cell and other casrexpressing cells involved in calcium homeostasis, such as in
kidney and bone, to sense alterations in the level of serum
calcium and respond with changes in activity that are directed
at normalizing the serum calcium concentration [6, 7]. presently  xxxd1701xxx  ( xxxd1701xxx ®) is the only approved calcimimetic
for treating dialysis patients with elevated pth [5]. although
 xxxd1701xxx  is a signiﬁcant advance in the management of
shpt, its use has been limited by gastrointestinal (gi) tolerability and poor compliance [5, 8]. thus, there is a need for
other calcimimetic agents that have improved efﬁcacy, better
tolerability and increased compliance over  xxxd1701xxx .
 xxxd3499xxx  (amg 416) is a novel long-acting peptide
agonist of the  xxxg343xxx  [9]. in the 5/6 nephrectomized rat model,
 xxxd3499xxx  treatment reduced plasma pth levels, markedly
reduced ectopic calciﬁcation and attenuated parathyroid gland
hyperplasia and downregulation of the  xxxg343xxx ,  xxxg2412xxx  and ﬁbroblast growth factor receptor 1 in the parathyroid
glands [9]. these preclinical ﬁndings supported the development of  xxxd3499xxx  as treatment for hemodialysis patients
with shpt.
this phase 1 study was undertaken to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (pk) and pharmacodynamics of
increasing single doses of  xxxd3499xxx  administered by iv
bolus injection to healthy adult male volunteers.

each dose level included: (i) observed maximal plasma concentration (cmax), (ii) area under the plasma concentration–time
curve from time 0 to ∞ (aucinf), (iii) total plasma clearance
(cl), (iv) steady-state volume of distribution (vss) and
(v) terminal elimination half-life (t1/2).
antibodies to  xxxd3499xxx 
a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa)
to assess the presence and concentration of antibodies to  xxxd3499xxx  in human serum was developed by kai pharmaceuticals and the protocol provided to millipore (st. louis, mo)
who performed the assay.

the demographic and mineral metabolic variables were not
different among the treatment and placebo groups. the only
exception was the mean baseline 1,25(oh)2 vitamin d which
was higher in the placebo group compared with the

response in serum ipth, calcium, phosphorus
and fgf23
there were no changes in the placebo group, other than
those from diurnal variation (figure 1). treatment with  xxxd3499xxx  at doses of >0.5 mg resulted in dose-dependent decreases in ipth. the decrease in ipth in the 2, 5 and 10 mg
dose groups was observed 10 min postdose (data not shown).
thirty minutes postdose, serum ipth was reduced by 3.5,
21.7, 55.4, 69.0 and 72.6% in the placebo, 0.5, 2, 5 and 10 mg
dose groups, respectively (figure 1a). the percent change in

statistical analysis
data from all randomized subjects were included in the
analyses. summaries of subject disposition, demographics and
baseline characteristics were examined by dose group.
all reported adverse events were coded to a standard set of
terms, using the medical dictionary for regulatory activities
(meddra®). a treatment-emergent adverse event (teae)
was deﬁned as an adverse event that occurred after the start of
study medication administration or that was present prior to
the start of study medication administration but increased in
severity after treatment. summaries of the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events were presented by dose group.
mean percent change in serum ipth, ica and phosphorus
concentrations were plotted over time for each  xxxd3499xxx 
dose level and for the pooled placebo group. urine creatinine,
phosphorus and calcium concentrations were summarized by
dose group using descriptive statistics.
the dose response trend in ipth, fgf23 and ica
reductions were examined by ﬁtting a ﬁrst-order regression
equation where percent change from baseline is modeled as a
function of  xxxd3499xxx  dose. due to the variation in serum
phosphorus levels, the following statistical analysis was conducted. treatment differences in phosphorus trend over time
was evaluated using the auc and was examined by analysis of
variance with dunnett–hsu adjustment. this type of statistic
is advantageous from both statistical and biological stand
points. statistically, it simpliﬁes the analyses by creating a single
summary response from multiple measurements and also increases the power of testing without sacriﬁcing the information
contained in the multiple measurements. biologically, it provides a means to incorporate both intensity and sensitivity
contained in repeated measurements into the statistical analyses [11]. analysis of percent change in ipth at 30 min postdose was performed using the analysis of covariance with
treatment and baseline value as a covariate with dunnett–hsu
adjustment.

 xxxd3499xxx  treatment groups and the placebo over the course of the study. the percent change in ipth at 30 min was signiﬁcantly different
from the placebo for all the  xxxd3499xxx  dose groups (p < 0.01 for the 0.5 mg group; p < 0.0001 for the 2, 5 and 10 mg groups).  xxxd3499xxx 
mediated a signiﬁcant (p < 0.05) dose-dependent reduction in plasma ica at 2, 5 and 10 mg at the 12 h time point. the changes in serum
phosphorus levels were not signiﬁcantly different from the placebo (p < 0.076).  xxxd3499xxx  (5 mg and 10 mg) mediated signiﬁcant reductions
in fgf23 compared with the placebo (p < 0.05). data are shown as mean±sem.

ipth at 30 min was signiﬁcantly different from the placebo
for all the  xxxd3499xxx  dose groups (p < 0.01 for the 0.5 mg
group; p < 0.0001 for the 2, 5 and 10 mg groups). the longterm response in serum ipth followed the diurnal rhythm
and, gradually attenuated by 24 h (figure 1a) and 48 h, the
value was back to the placebo control level.
 xxxd3499xxx  at 0.5 mg and placebo were associated with no
change in ica (figure 1b).  xxxd3499xxx  mediated a signiﬁcant
(p < 0.05) dose-dependent reduction in plasma ica at 2, 5 and
10 mg at the 12 h time point. the response was present at 6 h
postdose, was maximal between 15 and 18 h postdose and returned to baseline by 48 h postdose (figure 1b).
serum phosphorus levels varied diurnally (figure 1c) and
changes were not different in the placebo group and the  xxxd3499xxx  0.5, 2 and 5 mg dose groups. compared with placebo,
the serum phosphorus auc in the 10 mg dose group tended
to be higher but the difference was not signiﬁcant (p = 0.076).
 xxxd3499xxx  treatment was associated with a dosedependent decrease in serum fgf23 that was most apparent at
the 24-h postdose (figure 1d; p < 0.05). the 5 and 10 mg

k.j. martin et al.

doses of  xxxd3499xxx  mediated robust changes in fgf23 were
signiﬁcantly different from the placebo (p < 0.05). following
dosing with  xxxd3499xxx , serum 1,25(oh)2 vitamin d concentrations did not differ from placebo (change from baseline:
−3.0, −0.1, 2.3, −0.4 and −2.0 pg/ml for placebo,  xxxd3499xxx 
0.5, 2, 5 and 10 mg, respectively). neither did calcitonin levels
change signiﬁcantly.
response in renal tubular reabsorption of phosphorus
and calcium
 xxxd3499xxx  mediated a dose-dependent increase in tubular
reabsorption of phosphorus at the 0–24 h (figure 2a). at this
time period,  xxxd3499xxx   xxxd1891xxx  mg signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05)
increased tubular reabsorption of phosphorus by ∼50%. phosphorus reabsorption returned toward baseline in the 24–48 h
time period.
 xxxd3499xxx  or placebo had no effect on fractional excretion of
calcium (figure 2b).  xxxd1891xxx  mg, there was a trend to decrease in
tubular reabsorption of calcium for both the 0–24 and 24–48 h
time periods (figure 2b), but the trend was not signiﬁcant.

morbidity occurring in chronic renal disease. recently, several
clinical studies of ckd patients have demonstrated an association between high serum fgf23 levels and progression of
ckd [21], vascular calciﬁcation [22], left ventricular hypertrophy [23, 24] and increased mortality [25]. it is noteworthy
that  xxxd3499xxx  had little or no effect on 1,25(oh)2 vitamin d
levels in the present study. this may indicate an integrated
effect of a decrease in pth, which would be expected to lead
to a decrease in 1,25(oh)2 vitamin d, and a decrease in fgf23
which would be expected to lead to an increase in 1,25(oh)2
vitamin d [2, 26]. this lack of effect has also been shown with
 xxxd1701xxx  in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism [13].
the plasma pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3499xxx  were well
characterized in the current study and indicated that plasma
 xxxd3499xxx  increased in a dose-related manner.  xxxd3499xxx 
disposition was dose-independent across the dose range evaluated and terminal half-life in healthy male subjects was ∼19 h.
in contrast,  xxxd1701xxx ’s initial half-life is ∼6 h, the terminal
half-life ranges from 30 to 40 h and steady state is achieved
within 7 days. it should be noted that the pharmacokinetic
proﬁle of  xxxd1701xxx  is not affected by varying degrees of renal
impairment but food can change the bioavailability of  xxxd1701xxx  [27]. in contrast, the clearance of  xxxd3499xxx  is prolonged
with decreased renal function and leads to more prolonged
effects in this patient group [28].
as an iv product, the luminal gi exposure to  xxxd3499xxx  is
expected to be considerably lower than that observed with oral
calcimimetics. to the extent, the poor gi tolerability is related
to high local exposure to oral calcimimetics,  xxxd3499xxx  may
result in fewer gi adverse events [8]. consistent with the
hypothesis nausea, a frequent adverse event associated with
oral calcimimetics was not observed in this study, despite signiﬁcant biological effect on serum ipth and calcium. in
addition, because  xxxd3499xxx  is a peptide, it is expected that it
will not pass the blood–brain barrier and adversely affect the
central nervous system which is rich in  xxxg343xxx  [29, 30].
in summary, intravenous doses of  xxxd3499xxx , a novel
long-acting selective peptide agonist of the  xxxg343xxx  was generally
safe and well tolerated in healthy male subjects. dosing with
 xxxd3499xxx  resulted in dose-dependent reductions in ipth.
consistent with the observed changes in ipth, calcium levels
were reduced in a dose-dependent manner lagging the nadir
in ipth by several hours.  xxxd3499xxx  was associated with a
dose-dependent reduction in serum fgf23 but did not signiﬁcantly reduce 1,25 vitamin d or calcitonin. the iv route of
administration, long half-life and gi tolerability suggest  xxxd3499xxx  may provide a novel therapeutic alternative for controlling increased pth secretion in hemodialysis patients with
ckd–mbd.
