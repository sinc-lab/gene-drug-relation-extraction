abstract
the antagonist actions of clozapine and several other antipsychotics at 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)2 a and 5-ht2c receptors were
studied using the in vitro model of 5-ht-induced phosphoinositide (pi) turnover in rat choroid plexus (5-htec)and frontal cortex
(5-htea). while (-)-sulpiride and raclopride were inactive, clozapine and the other drugs behaved as antagonists both at 5-ht2a
and at 5-ht2c receptors. their order of potency (p inhibitory concentration (ic)50) was as follows. 5-htea receptors: risperidone
(9.07) > spiperone > chlorpromazine > clozapine > thioridazine = fluphenazine > haloperidol (6.03). 5-ht2c receptors: clozapine
(7.19) > chlorpromazine > risperidone > thioridazine > fluphenazine > spiperone > haloperidol (< 4.00). in each tissue, clozapine
shifted the concentration-effect curve for 5-ht to the right in the absence of an alteration in slope or maximal effect. these findings
indicate that clozapine acts as a competitive antagonist at 5-ht2aand 5-ht2c receptors and that its antagonist properties are shared,
though less potently at 5-ht2c sites, by several, clinically active antipsychotics.

in addition to dopamine, serotonin (5-ht) may play
an important role in the clinical actions of antipsychotics
[24,27]. several antipsychotics display significant affinity
for 5-htea receptors [18,25], a property associated with
a lesser propensity to induce extrapyramidal side-effects
and an improved efficacy in the treatment of the negative
symptoms of schizophrenia [9,19,20,27]. in addition, the
closely related  xxxg1115xxx  [11,12,16,17,21,29] may
also be involved in the action of antipsychotics [4,9,26]
and, in contrast to the classical neuroleptic, haloperidol,
the atypical antipsychotic, clozapine, displays marked
affinity for 5-ht2c receptors [4,31]. an important question concerns the functional nature of the actions of
clozapine and other antipsychotics at this site. in this
respect, the most rigorous and direct measure of intrinsic

activity is at the level of cellular coupling and both
5-ht2c and 5-hteareceptors are positively coupled to
the hydrolysis of phosphoinositide (pi) [5-7,16]. thus,
we have employed this parameter to evaluate the potency
and efficacy with which clozapine and several other, clinically active antipsychotics interact at 5-ht2c and
5-ht2a receptors. in addition, we examined whether the
putative interaction of clozapine at 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c
receptors was competitive in nature.
pi hydrolysis was evaluated in slices of immature (68-day-old) male and female wistar rats [28]. slices of
frontal cortex were prepared by 350 x 350-/.tm crosschopping. these were preincubated for 1 h in krebsbicarbonate buffer at 37°c in the presence of o2/co2
(95:5). aliquots of gravity-packed slices (50 /.tl)
were dispensed into 13 x 100 glass tubes containing 250
/11 of 5 /tci [3h]myo-inositol (amersham, les ulis,
france; specific activity 80-120 ci/mmol) and, after 20
min incubation, antagonist or buffer, each containing

10 p m and 10 mm) were added [3] and incubation continued for 10 min. serotonin (0.6 p m final) or buffer was
added for a stimulation period of 60 min. the reaction
was stopped by three volumes of chloroform/methanol
(1:2). extraction and separation of phosphoinositol was
by anion-exchange chromatography [3]. the procedure
used for the plexus has been detailed previously [28].
briefly, a single, freshly dissected rat (wistar, 120-140 g;
iffa-credo, illskirchen, france) plexus was incubated for
1 h in krebs-carbonate buffer at 37°c in the presence
of o2/co2 (95:5). plexi were labelled with 5 pci
[3h]myo-inositol. the stimulation procedure was as for
the cortex, except for the concentration of 5-ht (0.1/im
final). effective concentration (ec)50 values (concentration of agonist-stimulating pi hydrolysis to 50% of maximum), maximal effects and hill slopes were computed
with a non-linear weighed least-squares curve-fitting
program (micropharm, inserm, paris, france). ics0
values were defined as the concentration which reduced
the response of 5-ht to 50% of control. ics0 values and
pseudo-hill slopes of the inhibition curves were computed using the micropharm program. for competitive
antagonism studies, concentration-response curves of
5-ht were done in the absence and/or the presence of
clozapine: pk b = log ( d r - l ) - l o g [b], where dr was the
dose ratio, ecf/ec50 ( e c f : half-maximal response of
5-ht in presence of antagonist) and [b] the concentration of antagonist tested, picso values (-log icso values)
and pki values [4] were compared by pearson productmoment correlation coefficients.
5-ht increased cortical pi hydrolysis with a pecs0
(-log ecs0, -log m) of 6.78 + 0.17 (n = 5) and a maximum stimulation of 84.7 + 26.5% as compared with
basal level of 2000-3000 dpm. correspondingly, for antagonist studies, a concentration of 0.6 p m 5-ht was
employed (fig. 1). the 5-htza/2 c antagonist, ritanserin
[24] blocked pi hydrolysis in both structures. alone, antipsychotics (10 pm) failed to modify basal pi levels (not
shown). with the exceptions of raclopride and (-)-sulpiride, they all inhibited stimulated pi hydrolysis with
a rank order of potency of: risperidone > spiperone
> chlorpromazine > clozapine > thioridazine -fluphenazine > haloperidol (table 1). pseudo-hill slopes
were not significantly different from unity (table 1).
there was an excellent correlation between potency for
inhibition of pi production and affinity [4] at 5-ht2a
sites (r = 0.98; slope-- 1.34; p < 0.001; table 1). 5-ht
increased pi hydrolysis in the choroid plexus with a
pecs0 of 7.64 + 0.20 (-log m, n = 6) with a maximal
effect of 673 + 176% above basal levels (3000-4000
dpm). no change in basal levels was detected with antipsychotics alone (10 pm) (not shown). again, with the
exception of raclopride and (-)-sulpiride (inactive at 100
pm), all drugs antagonized the action of 5-ht. as haloperidol was weakly active (40% inhibition at 100 pm), no
ics0 was determined. the rank order of potency was:

in analogy to clozapine, the butyrophenones, haloperidol, spiperone and risperidone as well as the
phenothiazines, chlorpromazine, fluphenazine and
thioridazine behaved as potent antagonists at 5-ht2a
receptors and, to a varying degree, at 5-ht2c receptors.
in distinction, the benzamides, raclopride and (-)-sulpiride, were inactive. notably, there was a striking correlation between affinity at 5-ht2c and 5-ht2a receptors
and potency in inhibiting 5-ht-stimulated pi production
and, likewise, in agreement with binding data [4,31], the
majority of antipsychotics displayed a potency at 5-ht2a
receptors superior to that at 5-ht2c receptors. however,
clozapine was an exception in being more potent at
5-ht2c (pkb of 8.0) than 5-htea receptors (pk b of 7.56).
indeed, its activity at 5-htec receptors was only two-fold
less than that of the prototypical 5-ht2a/c receptor antagonist, ritanserin [24]. kuoppam~iki et al. [22] reported
that clozapine antagonizes 5-ht-stimulated pi formation in the choroid plexus and the present study extends
this finding in demonstrating that: (1) this antagonist
action is shared by other antipsychotics; (2) clozapine
and the other antipsychotics also act as antagonists at
5-ht2a receptors; and (3) clozapine behaves as a competitive antagonist. this is of importance for an understanding both of its functional actions in vivo and also of its
influence upon 5-ht2a and 5-htec receptors upon longterm administration. notably (see section on results), the
pk b values of clozapine derived from the rightward shifts
of the 5-ht concentration-response curves in the cho-

roid plexus and cortex were in excellent agreement with
the pk i values determined in binding studies [4].
one important question in the development of novel
antipsychotics is whether there may exist a systematic
difference between 'typical' and 'atypical' antipsychotics
as concerns their interactions at 5-ht2c and 5-ht2a receptors [9,26,27]. a clear distinction may be noted between haloperidol and clozapine in that only the latter
behaves as a potent 5-ht2c antagonist in vitro and in
vivo [10,14,15,21]. however, chlorpromazine also possessed high antagonist potency at 5-ht2c receptors.
thus, the presence of 5-ht2a~2c antagonist activity
[10,13,19,27,28] may not necessarily confer an atypical
profile upon an antipsychotic. further, clozapine displays many other interactions with, for example, ~1
adrenoreceptors [1,23] and 9 4 receptors [23,33] which
may likewise contribute to its distinctive profile. the
question of possible  xxxd1422xxx  actions of antagonists is, currently, attracting much interest [8,30,32] and,
in a recent study, barker et al. [2] showed that nih 3t3
fibroblasts transfected with cdna-encoding 5-ht2c receptors display constitutive activity in that antagonists,
such as ritanserin, decrease basal levels of pi generation
consistent with  xxxd1422xxx  rather than neutral antagonist properties [3]. such effects have not been reported
employing cns tissue preparations [7] and, herein, neither ritanserin, clozapine nor the other antipsychotics
modified basal pi activity. although this might reflect
the lesser sensitivity of this system as compared with this

cell line, it is possible that native cns-localized 5-ht2c
receptors are not constitutively active.
in conclusion, clozapine behaves as a potent and competitive antagonist at 5-ht2c and 5-ht2a receptors, a
property shared by several chemically diverse antipsychotics. these data reinforce the hypothesis that an antagonist action at 5-htzc and/or 5-ht2a receptors may
be of importance to the clinical profiles of antipsychotic
drugs.
