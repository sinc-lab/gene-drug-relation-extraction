heparins (unfractionated and low molecular weight (lmwh) heparins) primarily used as anticoagulants,
were found to be effective also in slowing down the development of some types of cancer. on the other hand,
the number of microvesicles in the peripheral blood originating from the budding of cell membranes (mostly
platelets) is increased in hypercoagulabile states as well as in cancer, indicating a possible common
underlying mechanism. it was hypothesized that by mediating an attractive interaction between phospholipid
membranes heparin suppresses microvesiculation and thereby acts as an anticoagulant and anti-tumor agent.
in this work, the effect of lmwh  xxxd2690xxx  on phospholipid membranes was tested in vitro in a system of
giant phospholipid vesicles (gpvs) created by electroformation and observed under the phase contrast
microscope. plasma of different blood donors containing different concentrations of  xxxd2690xxx  was added to
the suspension of gpvs to induce adhesion between gpvs. the attractive interaction between membranes was
assessed by measuring the average effective angle of contact between the adhered gpvs. it was found in healthy
donors, in a donor with gastrointestinal cancer and in a donor with rheumatoid arthritis that adding
therapeutic doses of  xxxd2690xxx  to the plasma samples enhanced adhesion of phospholipid membranes in a
dose and time-dependent manner while  xxxd2690xxx  alone had no effect within the therapeutic concentration
range. the results are in favor of the hypothesis that suppression of microvesiculation underlies both, the
anticoagulant and the anti-tumor progression effect of heparin.

introduction
thrombosis often occurs as a consequence of cancer. if occult, the
state was in a strict sense deﬁned as the trousseau syndrome [1].
the term now includes all hypercoagulabile states associated with
cancer [2,3]. heparins (unfractionated and lmwhs) being the
effective choice for prevention and treatment of thromboembolism
[4], revealed also a beneﬁcial effect by suppressing the tumor progression in some types of cancer [5–10]. other anticoagulants were
considered, however, in many cases they did not prove as effective
as heparin [5,6].
to explain the effect of heparin in the treatment of the trousseau
syndrome, several mechanisms were suggested, mainly pointing to
its role in biochemical reactions involved in the blood clot develop-

ment and interaction of free cancer cells with distal endothelial
cells [11]. understanding of the complex role of heparin in various
physiological processes related to the trousseau syndrome remains
yet rudimentary.
in this work we point to a non-speciﬁc biophysical mechanism which
could be involved in both, coagulation and tumor progression, i.e. to
microvesiculation of phospholipid membranes. microvesicles (microparticles) that are pinched off the membranes of different cells [12–16]
and travel with circulation, can be viewed upon as extracellular
organelles which may convey matter and information to distal cells.
by exposing  xxxg748xxx  and anionic phospholipids on the surface for
blood clot production, they act as catalytic surfaces for reactions involved
in coagulation mechanisms [17–19]. it was found that the number of
microvesicles in peripheral blood is increased in different disorders such
as thromboembolism, autoimmune diseases (e.g. antiphospholipid
syndrome) [20], cancer [21] and type ii diabetes mellitus [22].
to better understand the underlying mechanisms, membranes of
giant phospholipid vesicles (gpvs) are studied since they mimic some

essential features of cell membranes while their dimensions and
properties enable observation live under the optical microscope.
vesiculation of the gpv membrane can be induced by controlling the
environmental conditions, so it is possible to distinguish between
speciﬁc effects caused by exogenously added substances.
recently, a study on the effect of plasma phospholipid-binding
protein  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -glycoprotein i (a cofactor for antiphospholipid antibodies
in antiphospholipid syndrome) and antiphospholipid antibodies on
vesiculation of gpvs showed that budding and vesiculation of the
membrane can be affected by the solution in which the gpvs are
immersed [23]. namely, molecules and ions in the solution may
mediate attractive interaction between membranes and cause
adhesion, the effect depending on the surface charge of the
membrane. this was observed experimentally and described
theoretically [24,25]. the adhesion was quantitized by introducing
the effective angle of contact between the adhered vesicles [26].
measuring all clearly visible effective angles of contact in an image
and calculating their average value give a measure for the attractive
interaction between the membranes (y), where larger angle y
exhibits larger mediating effect [26,27]. the mediating effect was
revealed in  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -glycoprotein i which was previously found to be an
anticoagulant [28], while antiphospholipid antibodies (which are
considered procoagulant) diminished the effect of  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -glycoprotein i
[23]. further study showed that in the budding process, the bud can
be (due to the mediated attractive interaction between the
membrane of the bud and of the mother vesicle), adhering to the
mother membrane if the mediating effect of the solution is strong
enough [24]. it was suggested that similar mechanisms may take
place in cells and that substances, which mediate attractive
interaction between membranes and prevent pinching off the buds
from the mother membrane, are suppressors of microvesiculation. a
hypothesis was put forward on the anticoagulant effect of plasma
proteins [24]. as microvesicles were suggested to play a role also in
tumor progression, the above hypothesis was redeﬁned to include
both the anticoagulant and the anti-tumor progression effect of
plasma proteins. as microvesicles are promoters of blood coagulation
and tumor progression, any substance that suppresses microvesiculation would act as an anticoagulant and anti-tumor-progression
agent [29].
on the basis of clinical evidence indicating anticoagulant and antitumor progression effect of heparin and on the basis of the hypothesis
on mediated attractive interaction between membranes, we suggest
that the mediating effect of heparin would represent a possible
explanation for the observed clinical features.
in this work we investigated the effect of lmwh  xxxd2690xxx  on the
adhesion of gpvs. the effect of  xxxd2690xxx  dissolved in sugar solution
and of  xxxd2690xxx  dissolved in plasma samples of different blood
donors was induced by adding the sample to the suspension of gpvs
in the sugar solution and allowing the gpvs to adhere to each other.
the adhesion was assessed by the average effective angle of contact
between gpvs. we hypothesized that  xxxd2690xxx  would induce
adhesion between gpvs in concentrations that are comparable to
therapeutic concentrations in peripheral blood, the effect being more
pronounced (the average effective angle of contact being larger) for
higher concentrations of  xxxd2690xxx .
patients
six (6) donors who gave a written informed consent were included
in the study. one patient (female, 36 years of age) was diagnosed with
gastrointestinal cancer at the department of gastroenterology,
university medical centre ljubljana, the other patient (female,
54 years) was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at the department
of rheumatology, university medical centre ljubljana while four
persons were healthy individuals; two males (57 and 30 years,
respectively) and two females (62 and 65 years, respectively).

lipids, inc.
isolation of plasma
1.6 ml of venous blood was collected into vacutubes (bd
vacutainers) containing 0.129 m trisodium citrate (drawn blood
volume to citrate volume ratio = 4:1) and processed within 15 min.
following the centrifugation of blood (1550×g, 20 min, 20 °c, sigma
3k18 centrifuge, sigma), 300 mul of plasma was removed to be used for
experiments with gpvs. plasma was frozen at − 80 °c until
experiments with gpvs were performed.
preparation of gpvs
gpvs were prepared by the modiﬁed electroformation method,
originally proposed by angelova et al. [30]: popc and cholesterol,
both dissolved in a chloroform/methanol mixture at a concentration
of 1 mg/ml, were combined in the proportion of 4:1 (v/v). 20 mul of
lipid mixture was applied to each of the two platinum electrodes
shaped as rods (approximate length 4 cm and diameter 1 mm). the
electrodes were left in a low vacuum for 2 h for solvent to
evaporate. the lipid-coated electrodes were thereafter placed into a
microcentrifuge tube ﬁlled with 2 ml of 0.3 m sucrose solution to
form an electroformation chamber. ac electric current with an
amplitude of 5 v and a frequency of 10 hz was applied to the
electrodes for 2 h, which was followed by 2.5 v and 5 hz for 15 min,
2.5 v and 2.5 hz for 15 min and ﬁnally 1 v and 1 hz for 15 min.
after the electroformation, 600 mul of sucrose solution containing
gpvs and 1 ml of 0.3 m glucose solution were pipetted into each of
the three 2 ml plastic microcentrifuge tubes, which were afterwards
sealed with paraﬁlm band to prevent the entrance of air and to
protect the solution from microorganisms. vesicles were left for
sedimentation and stabilisation under gravity at room temperature
for 1 day.
preparation of samples
4 mul of citrated plasma, 4 mul of 0.3 m sugar solution (glucose:sucrose
ratio was 5:3) containing  xxxd2690xxx  and 32 mul of gpv suspension
were added in the plastic tube in the above consecutive order.
immediately after the addition of gpvs, the solution was transferred
through a circular opening into coverwell™ perfusion chamber
(grace bio-labs). the experiments were performed at room temperature. the ﬁnal dilutions of  xxxd2690xxx  (19.000 ui axa/ml) used in
the experiments with gpvs were 1:80 (237.5 ui axa/ml), 1:500 (38 ui
axa/ml), 1:5000 (3.8 ui axa/ml) or 1:7000 (2.7 ui axa/ml). the
dilution 1:7000 is within the therapeutical range of subcutaneous
 xxxd2690xxx  concentrations used for treatment of thromboembolic
disorders.
determination of the mediating effect of samples
the solution containing gpvs was observed by the inverted
microscope nikon eclipse t-300 with phase contrast optics. for all
experiments, the images of adhered gpvs were taken at different
times, at least 4 min after mixing gpvs with plasma samples and
heparin. gpvs adhered to each other in the timescale of minutes after
the addition of the sample composed of plasma and heparin, the effect

three times. to assess the adhesion between gpvs after the addition of
plasma (+ xxxd2690xxx ), all clearly visible effective angles of contact
between adhered gpvs were measured from the representative
images using the imagej software.
statistical analysis
the mean value and the standard deviation of the measured
effective angles of contact (y) were calculated by using the microsoft
excel software. the values of the average effective angle of contact
within each gpv sample at different times after the addition of plasma
(+ xxxd2690xxx ) were compared by using the t-test.

further in the next 20 min up to 74° ± 25° (n = 644). the effect

the mediating effect of  xxxd2690xxx  was however revealed at
signiﬁcantly higher concentration (dilution 1:80).
discussion
our results indicate that the addition of heparin to the plasma
increases the ability of plasma constitutients to mediate attractive
interaction between membranes. heparin in the sugar solution
exhibits the same effect, albeit too weak to have the impact in the
therapeutic concentrations. the effect was found in all plasma samples
considered: in healthy subjects and in both patients (with rheumatoid
arthritis and with gastrointestinal cancer). it was recently also shown
in the system of gpvs,  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -glycoprotein i and anti- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -glycoprotein i igg
antibodies (isolated from a serum of an antiphospholipid syndrome
patient with the history of thrombosis), that  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -glycoprotein imediated membrane adhesion was signiﬁcantly reduced in the
presence of anti- xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -glycoprotein i igg antibodies while therapeutic
concentration of  xxxd2690xxx  completely restored (rescued) the
adhesion [31]. all these results are in favor of the hypothesis of the
nonspeciﬁc anticoagulant and anti-tumor-progression effect of plasma
constituents through suppression of membrane vesiculation.

to explain why heparin in plasma signiﬁcantly affects adhesion
while the same concentrations in sugar solution have no effect, it was
interpreted that plasma already contains molecules that mediate
attractive interaction between membranes, while added heparin
enhances the effect.
in order to explain the intriguing anti-tumor-progression effect of
heparin, various mechanisms were suggested. an acknowledged
mechanism of metastatic potential is based on a scenario where
after intravasation, a metastatic cancer cell passes into bloodstream
where it forms a microembolus composed of the metastatic cell,
platelets and leukocytes. the microembolus travels to the vessel of the
target organ where the cell interacts with the endothelium of the
blood vessel and passes to the organ, where it can form metastasis. it
was suggested that heparin affects the interaction of a free malignant
cell with platelets rendering it more accessible to leukocytes and
diminishing its probability to adhere to endothelium [6,32]. the
underlying mechanism was suggested to be based on blocking of
selectins by heparin.
another mechanism was proposed to be based on ﬁbrinolytic
activity of heparin. it was suggested [33] that ﬁbrin mesh may serve as
a support for metastatic cells which is in line with the results of
experiments, indicating that ﬁbrinolytic agents are effective agents for
reduction of metastases [32,34].
furthermore, it was reported [35] that heparin uptake into cancer
cells can be promoted by conjugation to poly (beta-amino ester)s. detailed
studies [36] suggest that poly (beta-amino ester)–heparin complexes
affect cellular processes including the induction of transcription factor
and caspase activation. internalized heparin is considered cytotoxic,
causing cancer cell death by inducing apoptosis [36,37].
however, none of the hitherto proposed mechanisms explains both,
the anticoagulant and the anti-tumor-progression effects. in contrast,
both effects can be explained by suppression of the microvesiculation
which can according to our hypothesis be induced by mediating the
attractive interaction between membranes of the bud and of the
mother cell. here we present evidence that heparin enhances the
attractive interaction and can according to the hypothesis [24] act as a
suppressor of microvesiculation. furthermore, there are indications
that heparin is also an anti-inﬂammatory agent [38] and was proven
efﬁcient also in treatment of acute thrombosis and obstetric complications in antiphospholipid syndrome [31], which comprises yet other
mechanisms that are associated with microvesiculation.
the direct evidence of the suppression of budding was obtained
with artiﬁcial membranes having a controlled composition of lipids
[24]. in cells, the outer membrane layer is coated by glycans which
render the system intrinsically distinct. it remains to be elucidated
which mechanisms are essential in the budding of cell membranes,
and to which extent the phospholipid bilayer reﬂects the features in
the membranes. it should be pointed out that the attractive
interaction between membranes mediated by the molecules in the
solution, is of a short range (or the order of nanometers or even
smaller) and therefore applies to structures which are already very
close together (such as the bud and the mother membrane). this was
conﬁrmed by theoretical models of the mediated attractive interaction
between membranes [39,25].
conclusions
our results indicate that mediating attractive interaction between
membranes is a possible mechanism of microvesiculation suppression
of heparin, which may underlie its anticoagulant, anti-tumor-progression and anti-inﬂammatory effect.
