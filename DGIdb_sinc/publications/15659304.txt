abstract
we investigated the effects of intravenously administered  xxxd1747xxx  hydrochloride, a dual vasopressin v1a and  xxxg231xxx  antagonist, on
cardiac function in rats with congestive heart failure following myocardial infarction, and compared results with those for the selective
vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  antagonist sr121463a. rats were subjected to left coronary artery occlusion to induce myocardial infarction, which in
turn led to congestive heart failure. at 4 weeks after coronary occlusion,  xxxd1747xxx  (0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg i.v.) dose-dependently increased
urine volume and reduced urine osmolality in both myocardial infarction and sham-operated rats. sr121463a (0.3 mg/kg i.v.) also increased
urine volume and decreased urine osmolality in myocardial infarction rats, to a degree comparable to that by  xxxd1747xxx  (0.3 mg/kg i.v.).
at 6 weeks after surgery, myocardial infarction rats showed increases in right ventricular systolic pressure, right atrial pressure, left
ventricular end-diastolic pressure and relative weights of the heart and the lungs, and a decrease in first derivative of left ventricular pressure
(dp/dt max)/left ventricular pressure, showing that congestive heart failure was well established.  xxxd1747xxx  (0.3 mg/kg i.v.) significantly
reduced right ventricular systolic pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, lung/body weight and right atrial pressure in myocardial
infarction rats. moreover,  xxxd1747xxx  (0.3 mg/kg i.v.) significantly increased dp/dt max/left ventricular pressure. sr121463a at a dose of 0.3
mg/kg i.v. significantly decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and right atrial pressure, and tended to decrease right ventricular
systolic pressure and relative lung weight in myocardial infarction rats. although the aquaretic and preload-reducing effects of sr121463a
were similar to those of  xxxd1747xxx , sr121463a failed to improve dp/dt max/left ventricular pressure. these results suggest that dual
vasopressin v1a and  xxxg231xxx  antagonists provide greater benefit than selective vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  antagonists in the treatment of
congestive heart failure.

pectoris and myocardial infarction. although angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors and h-adrenoceptor antagonists have been shown to improve mortality in congestive
heart failure patients in recent large trials (cibis-ii
investigators and committees, 1999; hjalmarson et al.,
2000; pfeffer et al., 1992; packer et al., 2002), current drug
therapy is hardly optimal. as congestive heart failure
remains a fatal disease, the development of agents effective
against this condition is urgently needed.

in cardiac dysfunction, various neurohormonal mechanisms such as the renin–angiotensin system, sympathetic
nervous system and vasopressin system are activated to
maintain cardiac output following sodium and water
retention in kidney, and to maintain blood supply to vital
organs by peripheral vasoconstriction. the long-term result
of these compensatory mechanisms, however, is to burden
the diseased heart with an excessive workload, thereby
leading to its eventual collapse.
vasopressin receptors are classified into three subtypes,
namely vasopressin v1a receptors distributed in vascular
smooth muscle and liver, vasopressin v1b receptors in the
anterior pituitary, and vasopressin v2 receptors in the distal
renal tubule (birnbaumer et al., 1992; sugimoto et al., 1994;
thibonnier et al., 1994). given suggestions that the cardiovascular effects of vasopressin via vasopressin v1a and v2
receptors are closely implicated in a variety of cardiovascular
diseases, including heart failure, hypertension, hyponatremia,
renal diseases, and syndrome of inappropriate secretion of
 xxxd3495xxx , it is thought that vasopressin receptor
antagonists will prove useful in the management of these
conditions (fujisawa et al., 1993; naitoh et al., 1994; laszlo
et al., 1991). the development of nonpeptide, orally active
vasopressin receptor antagonists which are selective for
either vasopressin v1a or v2 receptors (yamamura et al.,
1991, 1992) has allowed evaluation of the pathophysiological
role of vasopressin in these cardiovascular diseases.
nonpeptide selective vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  antagonists,
however, developed owing to their aquaretic effects for
possible therapeutic use in heart failure or hyponatremia
(gheorghiade et al., 2003; shimizu, 1995) still produce a
reflex increase in plasma vasopressin levels (nishikimi et al.,
1996; laszlo et al., 1999; ohnishi et al., 1995; risvanis et al.,
1999), and in clinical use may consequently stimulate
undesired vasopressin  xxxg229xxx -derived effects, including
vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation (goldsmith, 2002;
palm et al., 2001). as a practical matter, it has been shown that
vasopressin infusion produces adverse hemodynamic effects
in patients with congestive heart failure, whereas vasopressin
 xxxg229xxx  antagonism produces hemodynamic benefits
(creager et al., 1986; goldsmith et al., 1986).
we have discovered a novel nonpeptide vasopressin
receptor antagonist,  xxxd1747xxx  hydrochloride, which has
high affinity for rat and human vasopressin v1a and v2
receptors and rather weak affinity for oxytocin receptors
(tahara et al., 1997). we previously showed that administration of exogenous vasopressin in anesthetized dogs
induces a pattern of cardiovascular dysfunction which
resembles congestive heart failure in patients, and that
 xxxd1747xxx  fully ameliorates this dysfunction (yatsu et al.,
2002). however, it remains unknown whether dual vasopressin v1a/ xxxg231xxx  antagonism is preferable to vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  antagonism alone in congestive heart
failure models.
in the present study, we investigated the effect of
intravenous administration of  xxxd1747xxx  in rats with

myocardial infarction-induced heart failure. results were
compared with those of the selective vasopressin v2
receptor antagonist sr121463a, which has comparable
affinities for rat and human vasopressin v2 receptors as
 xxxd1747xxx  (serradeil-le et al., 1996).

2. materials and methods
2.1. drugs
 xxxd1747xxx  hydrochloride and sr121463a were synthesized at yamanouchi pharmaceutical co., ltd. (ibaraki,
japan). the compounds were weighed, mixed with 10% w/v
ethanol (special grade; kanto kagaku, tokyo, japan),
stirred, then combined with 30% w/v  xxxd3034xxx 
(kanto kagaku). after dissolution by thorough stirring, the
ph of the solutions was adjusted to approximately 3.3 with
an appropriate volume of lactic acid (wako pure chemical
industries, ltd., osaka, japan), and the resulting solutions
were used as  xxxd1747xxx  (0.3 mg/kg) and sr121463a (0.3
mg/kg) dosing formulations. volumes were adjusted by
dilution with vehicle composed of 10% ethanol, 30%
 xxxd3034xxx  and 60% distilled water for injection.
sham and control groups were administered the same
volume of vehicle.
2.2. preparation of heart failure rats
post-myocardial infarction heart failure was induced in
rats by ligation of the left coronary artery (burrell et al.,
1996). briefly, male sprague–dawley rats aged 6 weeks
underwent left thoracotomy under ether anesthesia. the
incised area was extended using forceps and the pericardium
was opened. the heart was then pushed out of the chest and
the left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated
using silk thread. the heart was immediately returned to its
anatomical position and the chest was closed while slight
pressure was applied from outside so that air did not remain
in the chest. the skin was then sutured using wound clips.
the sham-operated rats underwent the same surgical
operation without actual coronary ligation. at 5 to 9 days
after the operation, an electrocardiogram was recorded from
the surviving ligated rats, and the presence of myocardial
infarction and the size of the infarct were estimated from the
appearance of abnormal q waves. in the present study,
mortality within 1 week of the operation was approximately
60%.
2.3. measurement of aquaretic activity
at 4 weeks after the operation, 39 myocardial infarction
rats survived. thirty were randomly selected without bias
and divided into five groups such that the distribution of
infarct size and body weight among groups were similar,
and given vehicle,  xxxd1747xxx  (0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) or

k. wada et al. / european journal of pharmacology 507 (2005) 145–151

sr121463a (0.3 mg/kg) by intravenous administration.
sham rats were also divided into four groups and given
vehicle or  xxxd1747xxx  (0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) by
intravenous administration. rats were then placed individually in metabolic cages and urine was collected for 3 h.
urine osmolality was measured by the freezing point
depression method using an osmometer (model 3c2,
advanced instruments).
2.4. measurement of hemodynamics and heart weight
at 6 weeks after the operation, the 39 surviving
myocardial infarction rats were divided into four groups
such that infarct size and body weight among groups were
equally distributed, and given vehicle,  xxxd1747xxx  (0.1 and
0.3 mg/kg) or sr121463a (0.3 mg/kg) by intravenous
administration. at 3 h after dosing, hemodynamic parameters were measured under pentobarbital anesthesia as
follows.
a cannula was inserted into the left carotid artery and
systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured with a
pressure transducer (ap-200t; nihon kohden, tokyo,
japan) via the cannula. mean blood pressure was then
calculated. heart rate was measured with a tachometer (ap600g; nihon kohden) triggered by the arterial pulse wave.
left ventricular systolic pressure and left ventricular enddiastolic pressure were determined via a 2fr micro-tipr
catheter transducer (millar instruments, tx, usa) inserted
into the left ventricle through the right carotid artery. peak
positive first derivative of left ventricular pressure (dp/dt max)
was obtained with an electrodifferentiator (eq-600g; nihon
kohden) and dp/dt max/left ventricular pressure was calculated by the division of dp/dt max by left ventricular systolic
pressure. right atrial pressure and right ventricular systolic
pressure were measured through a cannula placed in the right
atrium and right ventricle via the right jugular vein.
after the measurement of hemodynamic parameters, the
rats were sacrificed and the heart and lungs were removed.
scar tissue and remaining left ventricle including septum
were dissected from the heart, and scar tissue weight divided
by left ventricle including septum was calculated as a
measure of infarction size. relative weight of the heart was
calculated as a measure of cardiac hypertrophy by dividing
the total heart weight including scar tissue by body weight.
relative weights of the lungs were also calculated as a
measure of pulmonary congestion.

pressure in these rats (fig. 2). in contrast, no significant
changes were seen in heart rate or mean blood pressure
between the  xxxd1747xxx -treated and control myocardial
infarction rats (table 1). sr121463a (0.3 mg/kg i.v.) also
significantly decreased right atrial pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and tended to decrease right
ventricular systolic pressure in myocardial infarction rats.
unlike  xxxd1747xxx , sr121463a failed to increase dp/dt max/
left ventricular pressure in myocardial infarction rats, which
was significantly low compared with values with  xxxd1747xxx 
(0.3 mg/kg i.v.).
3.3. infarct size and tissue weight
there was no difference in infarct size among the
myocardial infarction-experimental groups and no infarction
was found in the sham rats (table 2). with respect to organ
weight, relative weights of the heart and relative weights of
the lungs were significantly increased in myocardial
infarction-control rats at 6 weeks after ligation (table 2
and fig. 2). intravenous administration of  xxxd1747xxx  (0.3
mg/kg) and sr121463a (0.3 mg/kg) decreased relative
weights of the lungs, but had no effect on relative weights of
the heart.

4. discussion
myocardial infarction induced by coronary ligation in
rats is a widely used experimental model of congestive heart
failure. it is characterized by the impairment of left
ventricular function, development of cardiac remodeling
and activation of neurohumoral factors. these characteristics show a reasonable resemblance to those of congestive
heart failure in patients, and the effects of drugs in this
model are therefore considered an important reference in
estimating their effects in patients with post-infarct congestive heart failure.
impairment of cardiac function results in the activation of
several neurohormonal systems, including the renin–angiotensin system, sympathetic nervous system and endothelin
or vasopressin system. these compensatory mechanisms
both maintain cardiac output by enhancing cardiac contractility and increasing circulatory fluid volume via the

promotion of sodium and water retention, and assist the
maintenance of blood flow to vital organs by peripheral
vasoconstriction.
elevated plasma vasopressin levels due to inappropriate
secretion have been identified in patients with congestive
heart failure. vasopressin secreted into the circulatory
system exerts diverse effects in the periphery. among
vasopressin  xxxg229xxx -mediated effects, vasopressin
raises peripheral vascular resistance, with a resultant
increase in cardiac afterload, induces coronary vasoconstriction (fernandez et al., 1998; walker et al., 1988)
together, leading to myocardial ischemia followed by
cardiac depression. in this regard, it was reported that
intravenous vasopressin infusion suppressed left ventricular
contractility in normal dogs (yatsu et al., 2002). moreover,
vasopressin  xxxg231xxx -induced water retention in the
kidney collecting ducts augments cardiac preload as a
consequence of an increase in circulatory fluid volume.
these concomitant effects work to depress the already
impaired cardiac function, and vasopressin is considered to
be an aggravating factor in congestive heart failure.
 xxxd1747xxx  is a novel nonpeptide vasopressin receptor
antagonist that shows high affinity for both vasopressin v1a
and v2 receptors. in previous in vivo studies, intravenous
administration of  xxxd1747xxx  inhibited exogenous vasopressin-induced pressor responses in pithed rats, and
increased urine volume without increasing urinary electrolytes in dehydrated conscious rats and dogs (tahara et al.,
1997; yatsu et al., 1997).
in the present study,  xxxd1747xxx  (0.03 to 0.3 mg/kg i.v.)
dose-dependently increased urine volume and simultaneously decreased urine osmolality below the plasma osmolality of 300 mosm/kg h2o, a characteristic of aquaretics, in
myocardial infarction rats. this finding is consistent with
previous reports that  xxxd1747xxx  (wada et al., 2002) and a
vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  antagonist (burrell et al., 1998)
elicited nearly equal aquaretic effects in sham and myocardial infarction rats 4 weeks after ligation with impaired
cardiac function and ventricular remodeling. in patients with
congestive heart failure, szatalowicz et al. (1981) reported
inappropriately high plasma vasopressin levels in spite of
the presence of hypoosmolality which should have suppressed plasma vasopressin levels. further, goldsmith et al.
(1986) found that plasma vasopressin levels in decompen-

150

k. wada et al. / european journal of pharmacology 507 (2005) 145–151

sated congestive heart failure patients could not be suppressed by acute water loading. these findings show that
vasopressin secretion in patients with heart failure is
inappropriately stimulated and may result in the complication of dilutional hyponatremia. given that water retentioninduced hyponatremia is a major predictor of mortality in
patients with congestive heart failure, the aquaretic effect of
 xxxd1747xxx  is considered to be beneficial, and to represent
an alternative approach to the relief of symptoms and the
amelioration of the severity of heart failure.
with respect to hemodynamics in myocardial infarction
rats at 6 weeks after coronary ligation, elevations in right
ventricular systolic pressure and left ventricular enddiastolic pressure, which are cardiac preload parameters;
a decrease in dp/dt max/left ventricular pressure, an indicator of cardiac contractility; and increases in right atrial
pressure and relative weights of the lungs, which are
markers of systemic and pulmonary congestion were
observed. in addition, an increase in corrected heart weight
showed the presence of cardiac remodeling. these changes
clearly show that congestive heart failure was well
established in myocardial infarction rats at 6 weeks after
surgery.
 xxxd1747xxx  was shown to significantly reduce the left
ventricular end-diastolic pressure, right atrial pressure and
lung/body weight in the myocardial infarction rats. given
that  xxxd1747xxx  exerted an aquaretic effect, the decrease in
cardiac preload and pulmonary congestion observed in this
study must be attributed to an increase in water excretion
mediated by vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  antagonism. we
consider it promising that sr121463a, a vasopressin v2
receptor antagonist, showed a closely similar effect to
 xxxd1747xxx  on these preload parameters.
in the present study, however,  xxxd1747xxx  and sr121463a
differed in their effect on cardiac contractility in myocardial
infarction rats, with  xxxd1747xxx  significantly increasing dp/
dt max/left ventricular pressure and sr121463a having no
effect. in previous studies in an experimental model and in
patients whose plasma vasopressin levels were elevated, a
peptide vasopressin receptor antagonist that shows selectivity
for vasopressin v1a receptors was reported to significantly
improve hemodynamics with reduced peripheral vascular
resistance (nicod et al., 1986; raya et al., 1990; creager et al.,
1986). in addition, vasopressin is known to produce potent
coronary vasoconstriction via vasopressin v1a receptors,
which results in myocardial ischemia (boyle and segel, 1986;
wilson et al., 1980).  xxxd1747xxx  has been shown to improve
cardiac contractility in pacing-induced heart failure in dogs
before any diuretic effect was exerted (yatsu et al., 1999).
taken together, these findings suggest that vasopressin v1a
receptor antagonism has the potential to directly reduce
cardiac afterload and suppress coronary constriction, resulting in an improvement in cardiac contractility in congestive
heart failure.
acute water depletion induced by the aquaretic effect via
vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  blockade stimulates vasopressin

secretion from the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system,
and it is reported that vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  antagonism in
rats and dogs with congestive heart failure reflexively
increases plasma vasopressin levels (nishikimi et al., 1996;
naitoh et al., 1994). therefore, after vasopressin  xxxg231xxx 
blockade, the possibility exists that plasma vasopressin
concentration may rise high enough to stimulate undesired
vasopressin  xxxg229xxx -derived effects. given that  xxxd1747xxx  demonstrates potent vasopressin  xxxg229xxx 
antagonistic activity as well as vasopressin  xxxg231xxx 
antagonistic activity, it could inhibit vasopressin v1a
receptor-mediated cardiac depression by excessive release
of vasopressin, leading to improvement in cardiac contractility. in contrast, the selective vasopressin  xxxg231xxx 
antagonist sr121463a would be unable to completely
block all of the vasopressin  xxxg229xxx -mediated cardiovascular effect. although the results of the present study
suggest that dual vasopressin v1a/ xxxg231xxx  antagonists
like  xxxd1747xxx  provide greater benefits than vasopressin v2
receptor-selective antagonists in the treatment of patients
with depressed cardiac function due to their obviation of any
compensatory counteraction of vasopressin, we obtain no
direct evidence that vasopressin excessively released by
counteraction of the aquaretic effect has a significant role on
cardiac function. further investigation is needed to clarify
this point.
in summary, the present study demonstrated that the dual
vasopressin v1a/ xxxg231xxx  antagonist  xxxd1747xxx  exerted
an aquaretic effect and decreased cardiac preload in
myocardial infarction rats. moreover,  xxxd1747xxx  improved
left ventricular contractility in myocardial infarction rats, in
contrast to the vasopressin  xxxg231xxx  selective antagonist
sr121463a, which failed to do so. these results suggest
that the dual vasopressin v1a and  xxxg231xxx  antagonist
 xxxd1747xxx  will be more beneficial in the treatment of
congestive heart failure than vasopressin v2 receptorselective antagonists.
