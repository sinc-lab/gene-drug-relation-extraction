abstract
to determine the role played by tyr356 (7.43) in the rat b1-adrenoceptor in binding the antagonists (+/–)cyanopindolol (4-[3-(t-butylamino]3-(2′-cyano-indoloxy)-2-propanolol) and its iodinated analogue (+/–)[125iodo]cyanopindolol (1-(t-butylamino]-3-(2′-cyano-3′-iodoindoloxy)-2-propanolol), tyr356 (7.43) was mutated to either phe or ala and binding affinities determined for wild type and mutant rat
b1-adrenoceptors. our results indicate that tyr356 (7.43) is important for (+/–)cyanopindolol, but not (+/–)[125iodo]cyanopindolol, binding and
that (+/–)cyanopindolol adopts a “reverse” binding orientation whereas (+/–)[125iodo]cyanopindolol cannot be accommodated in this binding
mode. we define a “reverse” antagonist binding mode as one where the aryloxy moiety interacts with residues on transmembrane helices 1, 2,
3 and 7. the b1-adrenoceptor site-directed mutagenesis results are the first to support a “reverse” antagonist binding orientation and the
involvement of tyr356 (7.43) in this binding mode.

1. introduction
there are few published mutagenesis studies examining
the requirements for antagonist binding to the b-adrenoceptor and most relate to the b2-adrenoceptor [1–5]. asp3.32
plays an essential role in the b2-adrenoceptor by interacting
with the amino nitrogen of the antagonist [3] and substitution
of asn7.39 by ala reduces the affinity of aryloxypropanolamines such as  xxxd3033xxx  and  xxxd123xxx , perhaps by preventing the formation of a hydrogen bond between asn7.39
and the aryloxy oxygen atom of these antagonists [1].

the present study utilised the rat b1-adrenoceptor to examine the binding orientation and points of interaction for
two structurally similar antagonists, i.e. (+/–)-4-[3-(tbutylamino]-3-(2′-cyano-indoloxy)-2-propanolol ((+/–)cyanopindolol) and its iodinated form (+/–)-1-(t-butylamino]3-(2′-cyano-3′-iodo-indoloxy)-2-propanolol ((+/–)[125iodo]
cyanopindolol) (fig. 1a,b). (+/–)[125iodo]cyanopindolol is
of particular interest as its low dissociation constant, in combination with its high specific radioactivity (2175 ci mmole)
and its specificity for b-adrenoceptors has made it the most
frequently used radioligand for b1- and b2-adrenoceptors [6].
in order to visualise (+/–)[125iodo]cyanopindolol and (+/–)
cyanopindolol binding a model of the seven transmembrane
(tm) regions of the rat b1-adrenoceptor, based on the recently
determined three-dimensional crystal structure of bovine
rhodopsin [7], was constructed and used in antagonist/
receptor docking studies. when manually docking the antagonists into the receptor model it was assumed that interactions between (i) asp138 (3.32) and the antagonist amino

nitrogen and (ii) asn352 (7.39) and the antagonist were essential for antagonist binding. we observed during the antagonist docking studies that if asn352 (7.39) interacted with the
aryloxy oxygen atom of the antagonist (as suggested by
suryanarayana and kobilka [1]) then the aryl moiety was
located in a hydrophobic pocket defined by residues in tms 1,
2, 3 and 7. our modelling studies further suggested that one
of the aromatic residues in this hydrophobic pocket,
tyr356 (7.43), was ideally situated to directly interact with the
antagonist aryl moiety. this antagonist binding mode resembles one previously described by lewell [2] and we
define it here as the “reverse” antagonist binding mode since
it contrasts with the more classical ideas of antagonist binding, i.e. where the antagonist aryloxy ring interacts with a
hydrophobic binding pocket involving residues in tms 5 and
6, while the antagonist maintains interactions with
asp138 (3.32) and asn352 (7.39) [5,8–10].
in the present study we mutated tyr356 (7.43) to either phe
(retaining an aromatic interaction) or ala (removing an aromatic interaction) and analysed the effects on (+/–)[125iodo]cyanopindolol and (+/–)cyanopindolol binding to the rat
b1-adrenoceptor.

2.1. radioligand binding studies
in table 1 the affinities of (+/–)cyanopindolol and its
iodinated derivative, (+/–)[125iodo]cyanopindolol for the

wild type and mutant rat b1-adrenoceptors are summarised.
saturation binding experiments yielded similar kd and bmax
values, although (+/–)[125iodo]cyanopindolol was slightly
less potent (three fold) at y7.43a mutant receptors compared
to wild type. the affinity of (+/–)cyanopindolol for y7.43a
mutant receptors differed greatly (5680-fold) with respect to
wild type, while retaining the aromatic interaction in the
y7.43f mutation maintained the binding affinity at wild type
levels.
2.2. antagonist interactions with the rat b1-adrenoceptor
the (+/–)cyanopindolol binding results for the wild type
and mutant rat b1-adrenoceptors suggests that there is a direct
aromatic interaction with tyr356 (7.43) (table 1). when (s)table 1

tyr356 (7.43). both tyr356 (7.43) and trp353 (7.40) make edge-toface p–p interactions with the aryl ring of (s)-cyanopindolol.
the cyano group can hydrogen bond to ser359 (7.46).
asn352 (7.39) and asp138 (3.32) can interact with both the amine
nitrogen and the b-hydroxyl group of (s)-cyanopindolol.
asn352 (7.39) is also able to hydrogen bond to the (s)cyanopindolol aryloxy oxygen. the t-butyl group is surrounded by trp134(3.28), phe348 (7.35), phe329 (6.51), val139 (3.33)
and thr135 (3.29). (s)-cyanopindolol cannot interact directly
with tyr356 (7.43) when the antagonist is docked in the “classical” antagonist binding mode, i.e. where the aryloxy moiety is orientated towards tms 5 and 6 and interactions with
138 (3.32)
asp
and asn352 (7.39) are maintained; nor can it interact
356 (7.43)
with tyr
when binding in variations of the “classical”
antagonist mode.
in contrast, the (+/–)[125iodo]cyanopindolol binding results suggest that there is no direct aromatic interaction
between tyr356 (7.43) and (+/–)[125iodo]cyanopindolol
(table 1). when attempting to dock (s)-[125iodo]cyanopindolol into the three-dimensional model of the wild type
rat b1-adrenoceptor in the “reverse” antagonist binding mode
the (s)-[125iodo]cyanopindolol conformation was energeti0
cally unstable (the dhf for the conformer was calculated
using the am1 hamiltonian within the mopac program, the
conformer geometry was found not to be a stationary point)
and therefore this does not appear to be a feasible binding
mode for (s)-[125iodo]cyanopindolol. (s)-[125iodo]cyanopindolol can however be easily accommodated in the rat
b1-adrenoceptor ligand binding site in several other binding
modes. in the “classical” antagonist binding mode, the aryl
ring of (s)-[125iodo]cyanopindolol is positioned near tms
5 and 6, interacting with phe233 (5.47), phe329 (6.51) and
phe330 (6.52) via edge-to-face p–p interactions. the cyano
group can hydrogen bond with ser232 (5.46) and also participates in p–p interactions with phe233 (5.47). the iodine sits in
the receptor channel surrounded by asp138 (3.32), val139 (3.33),
val142 (3.36) and trp326 (6.48). the aryloxy oxygen can hydrogen bond to asn333 (6.55). both the antagonist b-hydroxyl and
amine nitrogen can interact with asp138 (3.32). the t-butyl is
surrounded by trp134 (3.28), thr135 (3.29), asp138 (3.32),
phe329 (6.51), phe348 (7.35) and asn352 (7.39). however, in the
“classical” antagonist binding mode a direct interaction between asn352 (7.39) and the (s)-[125iodo]cyanopindolol amine
nitrogen is not possible due to the t-butyl group. the same is
true when (s)-[125iodo]cyanopindolol is docked in a binding
orientation consistent with that described for [125iodo]aminoflisopolol in the b2-adrenoceptor [11]. in this binding
orientation the aryloxy ring system of (s)-[125iodo]
cyanopindolol is located near tms 4 and 5 and interacts with
tyr224 (5.38) (via edge-to-face p–p interactions). both the
iodine and cyano interact with ser228 (5.42), while the amine
nitrogen and b-hydroxyl both interact with asp138 (3.32). the
(s)-[125iodo]cyanopindolol t-butyl group is surrounded by
trp134 (3.28),
thr135 (3.29),

phe
, phe
and asn
. as is the case for
the “classical” binding mode, asn352 (7.39) is unable to inter-

act directly with (s)-[125iodo]cyanopindolol when it binds in
this orientation. when (s)-[125iodo]cyanopindolol interacts
with the rat b1-adrenoceptor in a variation of the “classical”
antagonist binding mode, i.e. the aryl ring is located near tms
6 and 7 (fig. 2b.), both asn352 (7.39) and asp138 (3.32) are able
to interact with the antagonist amine nitrogen and the
b-hydroxyl. the iodine is ideally located to form a further
interaction with asp138 (3.32). the aryl ring forms edge-toface p–p interactions with phe348 (7.35) and phe329 (6.51).
asn333 (6.55) also interacts with the (s)-[125iodo]cyanopindolol aryl moiety. phe233 (5.47), which forms part of the
hydrophobic binding pocket for antagonists binding in the
“classical” orientation, does not interact with the aryl ring of
(s)-[125iodo]cyanopindolol as the distance between the two
aryl ring systems is >12 å. the (s)-[125iodo]cyanopindolol
cyano group points towards tyr224 (5.38) but does not make
any direct interaction with this residue. the t-butyl group of
(s)-[125iodo]cyanopindolol is surrounded by val111 (2.57),
trp134 (3.28), thr135 (3.29), asp138 (3.32), asn352 (7.39) and
trp353 (7.40).

3. discussion
more than one feasible binding orientation may exist for
antagonists, as they are not required to induce receptor activation and hence may have fewer binding restrictions compared to agonists. our site-directed mutagenesis studies, in
conjunction with molecular modelling, identified marked
differences in the manner in which the structurally similar
antagonists (+/–)cyanopindolol and (+/–)[125iodo]cyanopindolol interact with the b1-adrenoceptor.
the “reverse” antagonist binding mode proposed on the
basis of the mutagenesis studies for (+/–)cyanopindolol, i.e.
the aryloxy moiety is positioned towards tms 1, 2, 3 and 7
(fig. 2a), supports the binding mode previously suggested
for some antagonists binding to b2-adrenoceptors [1,2]. the
introduction of iodine into the (+/–)cyanopindolol structure
to produce (+/–)[125iodo]cyanopindolol severely restricts the
conformational flexibility of the molecule, increases its
physical size (fig. 1c,d) and prevents the aryloxy moiety of
(+/–)[125iodo]cyanopindolol from binding towards tms 1, 2,
3 and 7. hence, (+/–)[125iodo]cyanopindolol cannot adopt
the “reverse” antagonist binding mode, however it can be
accommodated in the “classical” antagonist binding mode or
a variation of this (one example is given in fig. 2b). the
molecular modelling results therefore indicate that the physical features of the antagonist will have a direct bearing on the
way in which the compound will bind into the receptor
channel. this finding is supported by the binding data
(table 1), as the y7.43a mutant did not display a large
reduction in affinity compared to wild type receptor, which
would be expected if an aromatic interaction between
tyr356 (7.43) and (+/–)[125iodo]cyanopindolol was lost. the
observed reduction in affinity (three fold) for (+/–)[125iodo]cyanopindolol by the y7.43a mutant compared to wild

type receptor is minimal and may reflect the result of the
mutation on the alignment or stabilisation of the residues that
directly interact with the antagonist. in comparison, the
5680-fold reduction in affinity for the y7.43a mutant observed for (+/–)cyanopindolol is restored to wild type levels
by the y7.43f mutation, providing strong evidence for a
direct aromatic interaction between the aryloxy moiety of
(+/–)cyanopindolol and tyr356 (7.43). the only way a direct
aromatic interaction could occur between the aryloxy moiety
of (+/–)cyanopindolol and tyr356 (7.43) is when the “reverse”
antagonist binding mode is adopted.

4. conclusion
our work has attempted to explain differences in the way
(+/–)cyanopindolol and its iodinated form, (+/–)[125iodo]cyanopindolol interact with the b1-adrenoceptor. the combination of molecular modelling and site-directed mutagenesis
studies identified a tyr residue on tm7 as critical for (+/–)
cyanopindolol but not (+/–)[125iodo]cyanopindolol binding,
thus highlighting differences in the manner in which these
two structurally similar compounds interact with the b1adrenoceptor. the site-directed mutagenesis results are of
particular interest as they provide the first direct evidence for
antagonist binding in a “reverse” mode, i.e. with the aryloxy
moiety positioned towards tms 1, 2, 3 and 7, and the involvement of tyr356 (7.43) in this binding mode.

were obtained from edward keller (hallam, vic, australia).
restriction enzymes ecor1 and xba1 were purchased from
promega corporation (madison, wi, usa). the plasmid
construct pgem3z-b1 encoding for the rat b1-adrenoceptor
was kindly provided by dr. curtis a. machida (oregon

5.6. data analysis
the data was expressed as the mean ± standard error of the
mean (sem) of 3–5 independent experiments. dissociation
constant (kd) (saturation studies), inhibition constant (ki)
(drug inhibition) and receptor binding density (bmax) values
were determined using the computerised iterative curve fitting program ebda version 4.0 which incorporates
ligand version 4.0 [15,16]. pseudo hill coefficients (nh)
were obtained from analysis of binding data using the sigmoidal fit function of the ebda program. student’s t test was
used to evaluate differences between means and critical values of p < 0.05 were judged significant.

4.0–7.0 å between ring centroids were deemed acceptable
for aromatic–aromatic interactions.
in this study, most of the amino acid residues have been
dually numbered. in superscript they are numbered according to their position in the receptor sequence and in brackets
they have been given a number which corresponds to their
relative position in the helix [17]. in this universal numbering
system, every amino acid number begins with the tm number,
followed by a number which defines their position relative to
the most conserved residue in that tm. the reference residue
is assigned the number 50.

5.7. homology modelling of the rat b1-adrenoceptor

5.8. docking (s)-cyanopindolol and (s)-[125iodo]
cyanopindolol into the rat b1-adrenoceptor model

a three-dimensional homology model of the seven tm
regions of the rat b1-adrenoceptor was constructed using the
crystal structure of inactive bovine rhodopsin as a template
(pdb file 1f88) [7], hence the rat b1-adrenoceptor model
was also presumed to be in an inactive conformation. loop
regions were not included in the model. the seven tm sequences of the rat b1-adrenoceptor and bovine rhodopsin
were aligned (not shown here, alignment is consistent with
palczewski et al. [7]). the amino acid sequence of the bovine
rhodopsin crystal structure was mutated to that of the rat
b1-adrenoceptor using the mutate functionality in the
biopolymer module of the modelling program sybyl (version 6.8, tripos assoc inc., st. louis, usa). in tm1 of bovine
rhodopsin ala1.36 was excised from the helix in order to
maintain the alignment of the conserved  xxxg1852xxx   xxxg2332xxx .30, met1.34,
 xxxg392xxx .41 and  xxxg392xxx .52 residues located at the extracellular end
of the helix. as yet we do not know the role played by these
conserved residues in g-protein coupled receptors but felt it
was important to maintain their alignment. the resulting rat
b1-adrenoceptor tm1 was annealed in the region of the excision site and compared to the bovine rhodopsin tm1 to confirm that conserved residues were still in alignment. excision
or inclusion of ala1.36 in the construction of the rat b1adrenoceptor model does not affect our modelling results as
the extracellular end of tm1 does not appear to be involved in
the ligand binding site. the crude rat b1-adrenoceptor model
was then subjected to molecular mechanics minimisation
using the following parameters; kollman all atom force field
and atomic charges, conjugate gradient minimisation, distance dielectric function and a dielectric constant of 5.0,
non-bonded cut off 8 å and 2000 maximum iterations (the
same molecular mechanics parameters were used when annealing the section of tm1 described above). after minimisation the rat b1-adrenoceptor model was superimposed onto
the bovine rhodopsin crystal structure via the backbone
atoms and the resulting rms was 0.8 å. the rat b1adrenoceptor model was also checked for consistency with
the known experimental data, predominantly b2adrenoceptor mutation data [1–5,8–11].
for hydrogen bond interactions, donor–acceptor distances
of 3.0–4.0 å were considered to be feasible. distances of

the antagonists (s)-(–)-cyanopindolol and (s)-(–)[125iodo]cyanopindolol were constructed within the sketch
functionality of sybyl in a fully extended conformation.
the (s)-isomers were used as they are known to be the most
active isomers. both compounds were structurally optimised using the tripos molecular mechanics force field and
gasteiger–huckel atomic charges (all other parameters
were left at the default values), and then using the am1
hamiltonian within the mopac (version 6.00) program as
supplied with sybyl. the parameters used for the semiempirical molecular orbital calculations were as follows;
am1 hamiltonian, precise convergence, no molecular mechanics correction for amide linkages and full geometry
optimisation.
the individual antagonists were then manually docked
into the rat b1-adrenoceptor ligand binding site, allowing
torsion angles to vary in order to maximise the antagonist
interactions with asp138 (3.32) and asn352 (7.39) (described in
the section 1). once the compound was docked into the
binding site, the entire antagonist/receptor complex was
subjected to molecular mechanics minimisation following
the same protocol as for the model construction, with the
exceptions that the tripos force field, gasteiger–huckel
atomic charges and 1000 maximum iterations were used.
for each antagonist several different binding modes were
examined.
the antagonist molecules were extracted out of the mini0
mised antagonist/receptor complex and the dhf was calculated for the bound antagonist conformation using the am1
hamiltonian within mopac. the parameters for the semiempirical molecular orbital calculations were the same as
described above for the fully extended antagonist conformations, except the torsion angles were not optimised in the
0
bound conformations. for both antagonists, the dhf for the
0
various bound conformations were compared to the dhf of
the fully extended conformation to ensure that the bound
conformation was energetically feasible (i.e. within
10 kcal/mol of the fully extended conformation and bound
0
conformations with a dhf more than 10 kcal/mol higher
were considered to be unrealistic and discarded).
