 xxxd2174xxx  and tacrine are allosteric antagonists at muscarinic m2 acetylcholine receptors and inhibitors of
acetylcholinesterase. at both acetylcholine-binding proteins,  xxxd2174xxx  and tacrine are known to occupy
two different binding sites: in m2 receptors within the allosteric binding area and in acetylcholinesterase at
its catalytic and its peripheral site. to find new ligands of both targets, we designed a  xxxd2174xxx -tacrine
dimer and several derived hybrid compounds to address the two binding sites. their  xxxg448xxx  allosteric
and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory potential was determined. the hybrid compounds revealed an allosteric
potency in the low nanomolar range exceeding the allosteric potency of  xxxd2174xxx  and tacrine by factors of
100 and 4800, respectively. cholinesterase inhibition was augmented by hybrid formation, and all compounds
exhibited ic50 values in the lower nanomolar range. thus,  xxxd2174xxx -tacrine hybrid formation is a valuable
approach toward high affinity ligands concurrently targeting these acetylcholine-binding proteins.
introduction
acetylcholine is the linchpin of neurotransmission in parasympathetically innervated target cells, autonomic ganglia, the
neuromuscular junction and the cns as it carries the nervous
signal across the synaptic cleft and to the final effector cells.
the level of acetylcholine inside the synaptic cleft is therefore
subject to sensitive regulation mechanisms. released at the
presynaptic terminal, acetylcholine diffuses toward the postsynaptic side. there it may either bind to muscarinic receptors
that are g-protein coupled or to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,
representing a group of ion channels. to terminate the resulting
signal, the synaptic cleft needs to be freed of acetylcholine, a
task that is mainly accomplished by acetylcholinesterase, a serine
hydrolase of therapeutic importance.1-3 tacrine is a prototypal
cholinesterase inhibitor, but it is also an allosteric modulator
of muscarinic receptors.  xxxd2174xxx  is an archetypal muscarinic
allosteric agent but at high concentrations it also inhibits
cholinesterases.
at both targets, tacrine and  xxxd2174xxx  can bind at topographically distinct places. a previous study on acetylcholinesterase
inhibition by tacrine-trimethoxybenzene heterodimers4 was
based on the dual binding site model, that involves the peripheral
and the active site.5,6 while tacrine commonly binds to the active
site of acetylcholinesterase, the trisquaternary phenolic ether
 xxxd2174xxx  is a long known ligand of the peripheral site.
since its discovery7 in 1947,  xxxd2174xxx  has been used as a
muscle relaxant ( xxxd2174xxx ) and was additionally found to
allosterically modulate muscarinic receptors.8 among the five
muscarinic receptor subtypes classified until today,  xxxd2174xxx 
exhibits a selectivity for the m2 subtype.9  xxxd2174xxx  belongs
to the group of typical allosteric modulators that bind in the
core region of the allosteric site.10,11 tacrine is an atypical
muscarinic allosteric agent.12,13 recently, the atypical molecular
interaction of tacrine at m2 receptors was elucidated by applying
a tacrine homodimer.14 the homodimer had a higher allosteric

affinity than the monomer. this finding suggested that the
allosteric site has room to accommodate two tacrine molecules
simultaneously, one in the core region of the allosteric site and
one in its periphery.14
inspired by this analogy of two distinct binding sites for
 xxxd2174xxx  and tacrine at both, acetylcholinesterase and the
allosteric site of the m2 muscarinic receptor, we envisaged
hybrids of tacrine and  xxxd2174xxx  or  xxxd2174xxx -related moieties
(chart 1) held together by a previously established linker.4 the
commonly utilized diaminoalkane linker of seven or eight
methylene groups5 was not suitable to carry the  xxxd2174xxx  unit.
however, our linker was chosen to stretch a comparable
distance, bringing the  xxxd2174xxx  moiety close to the peripheral
binding site. these novel hybrid compounds were thought to
exhibit increased affinity toward the m2 muscarinic receptor
and acetylcholinesterase by simultaneously addressing the
respective tacrine and  xxxd2174xxx  binding sites.
all compounds were evaluated as inhibitors of several
acetylcholinesterases with ic50 values in the nanomolar concentration range. comparable potency was observed for human
 xxxg248xxx , whose inhibition is expected to provide
additional benefits in alzheimer’s disease.3,15 the allosteric
potential of the hybrids was assessed by their ability to bind to
m2 receptors whose acetylcholine binding site was blocked by
the radiolabeled antagonist [3h]n-methyl-scopolamine ([3h]nms). in comparison to their building blocks,  xxxd2174xxx  and

results and discussion
synthesis. to gain a straightforward access toward compounds 24 and 25 shown in scheme 2 and to study the
importance of the substituents in the  xxxd2174xxx  scaffold, the
synthetic route was initially established for the simplified
compounds 13-16 (scheme 1). starting from hydroxysubstituted benzoic acids 1 and 2, the anticipated linker was
introduced at first. a prerequisite was the protection of the
phenolic groups to allow activation of the carboxylic acid for
coupling with ethyl  xxxd146xxx . thus, 4-hydroxybenzoic
acid (1) and 3,5- xxxd30xxx  (2) were acetyl-protected
by treatment with acetic anhydride in pyridine. both 4- xxxd234xxx  (3) and 3,5-bis(acetoxy) xxxd306xxx  (4) were
subsequently reacted with ethyl  xxxd146xxx  by classical
acyl chloride activation. selective deprotection was achieved
using potassium carbonate in methanolic solution to obtain
intermediates 5 and 6. during the fourth step, the phenolic
groups were alkylated with 1,2-dibromoethane following a
procedure of sarkar et al.16 to yield the 2-bromoethoxysubstituted compounds 7 and 8. these were quaternized with
triethylamine, and bromide salts 9 and 10 precipitated when a
concentrated solution in  xxxd102xxx  was added to ethyl
acetate. the precipitation from ethyl acetate proved to be a

valuable method to obtain these quaternary intermediates as well
as the final compounds as solid substances. the mono- and
bisquaternary carboxylic esters 9 and 10 were then converted
into their corresponding carboxylic hydrazides 11 and 12 by
reaction with aqueous hydrazine. the reaction conditions
established in the course of previous investigations4 had to be
adjusted to achieve an almost complete reaction of 9 and 10.
only complete conversion to 11 and 12 allows their collection
by precipitation from ethyl acetate without further purification.
the final seventh step was the introduction of a tacrine moiety
by treatment with either 9-chloro- or 6,9-dichloro-1,2,3,4tetrahydroacridine in sealed reaction vessels. the desired
compounds 13-16 were obtained as amorphous yellow powders
of notable hygroscopicity in overall yields between 20 and 36%.
following this procedure, efforts were undertaken to acquire
the envisaged  xxxd2174xxx -tacrine heterodimers 24 and 25
(scheme 2). preliminary investigations concerning the alkylation
of methyl 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate with 1,2-dibromoethane
unfortunately revealed the almost quantitative formation of a
benzo[b][1,4]dioxine (chart 2). to avoid this ring closure, the
para-hydroxy group had to be selectively protected, and a twostep alkylation process was employed. a benzyl protection was
considered the most practical solution as its removal conditions
are suitable for quaternary compounds. thus, starting from 3,4,5trihydroxybenzoic acid (17), the first two steps were again the
acetyl protection of all three phenolic groups to give 18 and

coupling with ethyl  xxxd146xxx . following a method
adapted from pearson et al.,17 the para-acetoxy moiety was
exchanged by a benzyl group and the two remaining metaacetoxy groups were cleaved to obtain 19, which was subsequently treated with 1,2-dibromoethane to yield intermediate
20. reaction with triethylamine produced a bisquaternary
carboxylic ester that was deprotected by hydrogenolysis and
again alkylated with 1,2-dibromoethane. this second alkylation
was found extremely sensitive to oxidation and had to be
carefully protected by argon to achieve 21 free from any
degradation products. the subsequent quaternization toward the
trisquaternary carboxylic ester 22 was another crucial step as
the use of nitromethane led to constant impurities that could
not be removed. however, acetonitrile dissolved both educt and
product at higher temperatures, and pure 22 precipitated upon

cooling. the following  xxxd2396xxx  formation and coupling of
23 with 6-chloro- or 6,9-dichloro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine
proceeded smoothly, and the final compounds 24 and 25 were
obtained after 11 steps in 15% overall yield each.
molecular docking and cholinesterase inhibition. possible
binding modes of the quaternary target compounds 13, 15 and
24 were investigated using the autodock software suite.18 the
1zgb19 crystal structure of acetylcholinesterase from torpedo
californica in complex with a tacrine heterodimer was used as
the docking template, because it already accommodates a hybrid
inhibitor that stretches the entire gorge, binding simultaneously
to both binding sites. the tacrine moiety was found to bind to
the active site as in the crystal structures 1acj20 (tcachetacrine) or 1zgb (tcache-tacrine-hupyridone), while interactions of the  xxxd2396xxx  linker with asp72 and tyr121 were
observed as similarly reported before21 (residue numbering
throughout this report will refer to the organism of the complex
discussed). the main emphasis was put on possible interaction
partners at the utmost gorge entrance. the  xxxd3027xxx -mmache (pdb 1n5r22) complex showed, that the quaternary side
chain is pointing out of the gorge in two distinct orientations.
it is either bound to an outer surface loop, comprised by
leu289-ser293, or it interacts with his287. these orientations

result from two possible binding modes of the phenylphenanthridinium system, that forms a pi-pi stacking with trp286 and
may be flipped by 180 degrees. for our compounds, a pi-pi
stacking of the benzamide unit with the corresponding trp279
was not observed because the amide bond forms hydrogen bonds
to mid-gorge amino acid residues, as was already found with a
series of tacrine-trimethoxybenzene heterodimers.23
in all three compounds 13, 15, and 24, one of the quaternary
side chains is located at the same, fixed position. the backbone
carbonyl oxygens of phe284 and ser286, and the side chain
oxygens of asp285 and ser286 were found at the base of a
pyramid, with the ammonium nitrogen at its top (figure 1a).
as this interaction is observed in all three docking sets, it is

believed that the binding to the outer gorge lip plays a dominant
role in ligand association. the second ammonium side chain
of compound 15 (figure 1b) is directed toward the gorge middle,
where it is found on an axis connecting tyr70 and tyr334. this
location allows the excellent accommodation of the ethyl
substitutents, each of them pointing into a separate surface
pocket. compound 24 (figure 1c) carrying three quaternary side
chains was the most complex structure to dock with a high level
of torsional constraints. again, the triplet of phe284, asp285,
and ser286 is addressed by one ammonium group, this time in
para position, while one of the meta side chains points into the
gorge and the other toward the entrance. it is the inward pointing
side chain that finds a perfect fit at the gorge center and forces
the opposite side chain outward.
the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase was investigated for
enzymes from electrophorus electricus, torpedo californica,
and homo sapiens, while  xxxg248xxx  inhibition was
determined using the human enzyme. ic50 values derived from
duplicate experiments are listed in table 1, also including the
selectivity between the two human cholinesterases. data obtained for tacrine and  xxxd2174xxx  in the presence of 6%
acetonitrile differed notably from our results (table 1) and
literature reports24-26 in the absence of acetonitrile. for two
acetylcholinesterases, higher ic50 values were observed in the
presence of acetonitrile, whereas the opposite applies to human
 xxxg248xxx  inhibited by tacrine. these findings will
be covered in more detail in a future report.
it was found that increasing substitution of the gallaminederived moiety tends to reduce the inhibitory potency. in the

case of acetylcholinesterase from electrophorus electricus, the
affinity decreased by 2 orders of magnitude when comparing
compounds 13, 15, and 24. this loss in inhibitory potency due
to increasing substitution was only 2- or 3-fold for the other
three cholinesterases, as it was also observed in the case of the
chloro-substituted derivatives 14, 16, and 25 with all studied
cholinesterases. this might indicate the overall increase in
energy consumption due to an increase of torsional constraints.
in case of a chloro substitution at position 6 of the tacrine moiety
(14, 16, 25), a significant loss in inhibitory potency toward
acetylcholinesterase from torpedo californica and a switch in
selectivity from human  xxxg248xxx  to acetylcholinesterase was observed. both phenomena are tightly linked to
pro446 in hache and its counterpart met437 in hbche or
ile439 in tcache. while the proline offers enough space to
accommodate a chlorine at position 6, neither the methionine
nor the isoleucine do so and thus impair the binding of a chlorosubstituted tacrine to the active site (figure 2). the 5-fold
selectivity toward acetylcholinesterase achieved by the introduction of chlorine is in accordance with previous reports.27,28

building blocks and the hybrids 13-16, 24, and 25 with m2

consequence of ligand binding to the allosteric site, which is
located in the extracellular entrance of the receptor’s binding
cleft, the dissociation of [3h]nms was inhibited. all compounds

indicated by a reduction of the apparent rate constant k-1 (figure
3). pec50,diss values, that is, minus log concentrations for a halfmaximum effect, correspond to test compound binding affinity
for the allosteric site (table 2). the pec50,diss values found for
 xxxd2174xxx  and tacrine were in agreement with previous reports.13,29 hybrid formation increased the allosteric potency by
factors of 100 relative to  xxxd2174xxx  and 4800 relative to tacrine.
this gain in potency is of particular interest since homodimerization of tacrine only resulted in a 20 fold increase in allosteric
potency.14 remarkably, five hybrid substances exhibited ec50,diss
values around 1 nm, only for 14 a slightly increased value of
5 nm was observed. neither the introduction of chlorine (14,
16, 25) into the tacrine ring system, nor the successive
simplification of the  xxxd2174xxx  moiety had a significant effect
on allosteric potency. for example, the removal of one para(15 vs 24) or two meta-triethylammonioethoxy substituents (13
vs 24) retained the inhibition of [3h]nms dissociation. thus,
the number and position of the triethylammonioethoxy substituents is not decisive for the pronounced gain in potency.
whereas the concentration-effect curve of tacrine was steep
(table 2), as expected for an atypical allosteric modulator, most
hybrids showed curve slopes not different from unity, which is
in agreement with a typical mode of allosteric action. again,
14 was an exception in that its curve slope was slightly steeper
than unity (table 2).

conclusion
the successful synthesis of the  xxxd2174xxx -tacrine hybrid 24
was accomplished through a multistep convergent synthesis
based on a concise protection-deprotection strategy and the
previously established linker chemistry. all compounds exhibited a profound inhibitory potential toward acetylcholinesterases
as well as  xxxg248xxx . the simplified derivative 13
was found to be a very potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase
from electrophorus electricus with an ic50 value of about 500
pm and showed a three times increased activity at human
acetylcholinesterase compared to the trisquaternary compound
24. the anticipated influence of a 6-chloro substitution of the
tacrine moiety on cholinesterase selectivity was observed, though
all compounds tend to be rather unselective inhibitors of both
human cholinesterases. the allosteric potency of the gallaminetacrine hybrids at m2 receptors is strongly increased compared
to their building blocks,  xxxd2174xxx  and tacrine. as the orthosteric
site was occupied by the radioligand in these experiments, the
gain in potency is explained by simultaneous hybrid binding to
the core region and the peripheral region of the allosteric site.
the detailed elucidation of the allosteric modulation of muscarinic receptors, including the question of whether orthosterically free receptors might allow for an allosteric-orthosteric
hybrid binding topography, will be the subject of further studies
and reported in due course.

solution, 60 µl of acetonitrile, 10 µl of an inhibitor solution, and
10 µl of a cholinesterase solution (∼3 u/ml) were added and
thoroughly mixed. after incubation for 15 min at 25 °c, the reaction
was initiated by adding 50 µl of the acetyl- or butyrylthiocholine
solution.

molecular docking studies. crystal structures of several
acetylcholinesterase complexes ( xxxd3270xxx ,20 1zgb,19 and 1n5m22)
were retrieved from the protein data bank. unnecessary information
from the pdb files was dropped by keeping only the atom entries,
missing side chain atoms were generated using the repair feature
of the adt suite,34 and polar hydrogens were added. using the
corina35 web service, three-dimensional coordinates were obtained for the ligands. openbabel36 was used to convert these pdb
files to mol2 format, which allows the addition of partial charges
that were calculated using mopac.37 it can be observed from the
crystal structures above and one obtained for the precursor 6,9dichloro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine38 that only one tacrine conformer
is energetically favored. therefore, the right conformer and the
protonation at the endocyclic nitrogen has to be considered when
generating these coordinates. as a result of the energy minimization,
the structures from the corina algorithm tend to be stretched,
which gives a good bias toward the anticipated binding mode.
autodock18 was used to discover possible binding modes, as it
implements a more meticulous scoring procedure than the gold39
software used in previous investigations.4 in addition to the
evaluation of hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding contacts, there
are additional terms regarding electrostatic interactions, the ligands’
torsional entropy, and desolvation upon binding. this was thought
to drive the docking process into the right direction with respect to
the quaternary side chains. the docking grid (180 000 points, 50
× 60 × 60, 0.375 å) was centered in between tyr121 and phe330
(pdb 1zgb, torpedo californica) to stretch the complete distance
from the active to the peripheral binding site. a population of 100
chromosomes and a set of 100 000 generations with the rigid root
placed at the center of mass was chosen for 100 runs. this resulted
in negative binding energies ∆gbind for all compounds, with a
stepwise decrease of freed energy as the substitution pattern
increased. this is probably due to the increasing amount of torsional
energy, which exceeds the energy estimation for the binding process.
to validate the applied docking procedures, a classical redocking
approach was undertaken. tacrine and  xxxd2174xxx  were removed
from their corresponding crystal structures ( xxxd3270xxx , 1n5m) and
rebuilt by the same procedure as applied for ligand preparation.
they were then docked into the gorge without any bias toward the
active or peripheral binding site, and the top-scored poses were
compared with their original position in the crystal structure. the
predicted positioning of tacrine comes very close to the one
observed in  xxxd3270xxx . the rmsd calculated by pymol40 adds up to
0.561 å, which is accounted by the literature41 to be a very good
fit. looking at  xxxd2174xxx , the matching is not as good as with tacrine
but still acceptable. the crystal structure of acetylcholinesterase in
complex with  xxxd2174xxx  (1n5m) does not state the conformation
of the quaternary side chains. the rmsd comparison refers therefore
only to the tris-substituted benzene moiety and gives a value of
2.498 å. from a total of 100 runs, 87% located the  xxxd2174xxx  ligand
at the peripheral binding site, which demonstrates its clear bias to
bind peripherally.
radioligand binding assay. membranes were prepared from
porcine hearts at 4 °c as described before.14,29 ventricular tissue
(40 g) was homogenized in a 0.32 m sucrose solution and
centrifuged for 11 min at 300 g (2000 rpm in a beckman rotor
35). thereafter, the supernatant was centrifuged for 40 min at 80 000
g (32 000 rpm in a beckman rotor 35), and the resulting pellet was
resuspended in 4 mm na2hpo4, 1 mm kh2po4, ph 7.4 (4 ml/g
original tissue wet weight). aliquots (0.5 ml) were shock frozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °c; the protein content ranged
between 0.3 and 0.9 mg/ml.
for measurement of [3h]nms binding cardiac membranes (60100 µg protein/ml) were incubated with 0.2 nm [3h]nms in 5
mm na,k,pi-buffer, ph 7.4 at 23 °c. atropine (1 µm) served to
define nonspecific binding. under control conditions specific
binding of [3h]n-methylscopolamine was characterized by a pkd

radioligand of 30 min, the time course of [3h]nms dissociation
was visualized by adding 1 µm atropine. test compounds were
added together with atropine. at time intervals suited to describe
the time course of dissociation, 1 ml aliquots were separated and
filtered rapidly (glass fiber filters no. 6, schleicher and schüll,
dassel, frg). after washing the filters (twice with 5 ml of ice
cold incubation buffer), they were placed into scintillation vials,
and the radioactivity was determined in the presence of 5 ml of
ready protein (beckman) by liquid scintillation counting in a
beckman ls 6500. data of individual experiments were analyzed
by nonlinear regression analysis using the prism software (ver. 4.0,
graph pad, san diego, u.s.a.). dissociation data was fitted to a
monoexponential decay function; biexponential curve fitting did
not yield better results (f-test, p g 0.05, data not shown). the rate
constant of radioligand dissociation was calculated from the halflives using eq 2

concentration effect curves for the effect of the modulators on
the rate constant k-1 of [3h]nms dissociation were analyzed by a
four-parameter logistic equation. it was checked whether the curve
slope deviated from unity (f-test). multiple comparisons were
carried out by one-way anova with tukey’s multiple comparison
test. a p value < 0.05 was taken as the criterion for statistical
significance.
