pz-adrenergic
dilation
of conductance
coronary
arteries involves flow-dependent
no formation
in conscious
dogs. am. j. physiol. 271 (heart circ. physiol. 40): hl926h1937, 1996.-the
contribution
of  xxxd2738xxx  (no) formation to the dilation of large epicardial
coronary arteries to pland l32-adrenergic
receptor stimulation
was investigated
in
conscious dogs. after pi-adrenergic
blockade
(atenolol,
1.0
mg/kg iv), selective pz-adrenergic
receptor
activation
with
intracoronary
bolus injections
of  xxxd2964xxx 
(50 rig/kg) increased coronary blood flow (cbf) by 95 ? 19% from 48.5 ?
8.4 ml/min and external epicardial
coronary diameter (cd) by
0.14 t 0.03 from 3.23 ? 0.31 mm. after intracoronary
n”-nitro-l-arginine
methyl ester (l-name, 50 ugakg-l*rnin-l
x 12 min) was administered,
baseline cd decreased but cbf
was not altered. after l-name, bolus injections of  xxxd2964xxx 
resulted in smaller (p < 0.01) cbf responses (40 t 12%), and
increases
in cd were abolished.
when  xxxd2964xxx 
(500
nge kg-l emin-l)
was given as a continuous
infusion,
cbf
increased by 36 * 5% from 55.4 2 5.8 ml/min and cd by
0.16 t 0.03 mm from 3.44 ? 0.16 mm. l-name abolished cd
increases and limited (p < 0.01) cbf responses to 9 t 3%.
when increases in cbf caused by  xxxd2964xxx 
before l-name
were prevented
by arterial
constriction,
cd increases were
suppressed.
in contrast,
cbf and cd responses
to pladrenergic
stimulation
were maintained
after l-name. thus
pz-adrenergic
dilation
of epicardial
conductance
arteries is
primarily
a flow-dependent
process involving
no formation.
in contrast, p1-adrenergic
activation
produces epicardial
coronary dilation
independent
of an l-name-sensitive
mechanism.

in vivo, selective activation of pl- and p2-adrenergic
receptors elicits significant increases in the caliber of
large epicardial coronary arteries in conscious dogs (12,
31). in a recent study, ghaleh et al. (12) reported that
pz-adrenergic dilation of epicardial coronary arteries
was prevented after the endothelium was removed with
a balloon catheter. in contrast, pl-adrenergic dilation of
large epicardial
coronary arteries was endothelium
independent.
the involvement
of the l-arginine/nitric
oxide pathway
in pl- and l&adrenergic
dilation of
conductance and resistance coronary vessels was not
considered in those studies. a direct influence of pl- and
p2-adrenergic receptors on large epicardial coronary
arteries was demonstrated
in conscious calves where
subtype-specific agonists dilated large epicardial arteries when increases in cbf were prevented (30). ligandbinding studies performed on smooth muscles of these
large coronary arteries confirmed the presence of both
pl- and l&-adrenergic receptor subtypes. the possibility
that receptors located on endothelial
cells were involved in responses to p-adrenergic agonists cannot be
excluded.
we sought to determine
the contribution
of no
formation
to pl- and p2-adrenergic dilation of conductance coronary arteries in conscious dogs and to examine the relative contribution
of receptor-operated
and
flow-dependent
mechanisms to this process. regional
pl- and p2-adrenergic stimulation
before and after
blockade of no formation were performed using intracoronary drug delivery to limit the confounding hemodynamic effects of systemic blockade of no formation.

n”-rho-l-arginine

methyl ester (l-name)
is a powerful
antagonist
of
pz-adrenergic-mediated
coronary blood flow (cbf) responses, consistent with the involvement
of  xxxd2738xxx 
(no) format’ ion in this process (23). whether a similar
mechanism intervenes in the dilation of conductance
epicardial coronary arteries to pl- and pz-adrenergic
agonists has not been considered in vivo. studies
conducted on isolated canine coronary arteries have
yielded conflicting results. rubanyi and vanhoutte (25)
and bernard
et al. (4) reported
that p-adrenergic
dilation is partially endothelium
dependent, but macdonald et al. (20) and bea et al. (3) found no evidence for
a role of the endothelium
in p-adrenergic
dilation of
canine coronary arteries. conceivably, no formation
triggered by p-adrenergic receptors may be a process
more important
in resistance-sized
coronary vessels
than in large caliber coronary arterial vessels.

under general anesthesia
with pentobarbital

mg/kg iv) and under sterile conditions,
15 mongrel
dogs
(29 ? 1 kg) underwent
a left thoracotomy
at the fifth

space while under artificial
ventilation.
the pericardium was widely incised parallel to the phrenic nerve. a
tygon (norton plastics and synthetic
division, akron, oh)
catheter was implanted
in the thoracic aorta. this catheter
was connected to an external transducer
(model 800, bentley

arterial
pressure.

pulse was used to monitor
heart rate (hr). an
ultrasonic
doppler blood flow transducer
was placed around
the left circumflex
coronary artery, 2-3 cm from the bifurcation of the left main coronary
artery. cbf was monitored
using a 10 mhz-pulsed
doppler flowmeter
(17). mean cbf
was obtained with an active filter with a time constant of 2 s.
the linearity
of the relation
between
flow velocity
and
doppler
shift has been previously
demonstrated
for this
instrument
and was confirmed
in our laboratory
by in vitro
testing. at necropsy, the internal
circumference
of the vessel
under the probe was measured
to obtain the vessel crosssectional
area and to calculate
a calibration
factor (in
mlmin-l
khz-l).
a silastic
(dow corning,
midland,
mi)
catheter was implanted
proximal
to the flow probe with the
tip in the lumen of the circumflex
coronary
artery (l-2 cm
from the bifurcation
of the left main coronary artery), using
the approach
described
by gwirtz (16). the portion of the
catheter within the coronary vessel had an external diameter
of 0.6 mm. distal to the doppler
flow probe, a pair of
miniature
ultrasonic
crystals (1 x 2 mm, 7 mhz) was sutured
with 5-o prolene on opposite sides of the left circumflex
coronary artery after adequate alignment.
the crystals were
located 1.5-2.5 cm distal to the tip of the coronary catheter
before the first marginal
branch of the circumflex
coronary
artery. external
cd was monitored
using an ultrasonic
sonomicrometer
(model 120.2, triton technology, san diego,
ca). the pericardium
was left open, the chest was closed in
layers, and the catheters and wires were exteriorized
on the
back of the animals. analgesia
was provided postoperatively
with 0.3 mg im buprenorphine
(temgesic, reckitt and colman pharmaceuticals,
hull, uk). prophylactic
procaine  xxxd2871xxx  (300,000 u im) and benzathine
penicillin
g (300,000
u im) were administered
for 10 days after the surgery.
enteric-coated
aspirin
(650 mg/day po) was begun the day
after surgery and given on a daily basis thereafter.
in 8 of 15 dogs, a hydraulic
occluder was placed around the
coronary artery distally to the dimension
crystals in addition
to the instrumentation
described
above. this occluder was
located after the first marginal
branch of the left circumflex
coronary artery in five of these dogs. this occluder was used
to prevent increases in cbf during  xxxd2964xxx 
administration
and to produce flow-dependent
dilation
of large epicardial
coronary arteries following
the release of transient
coronary
artery occlusions.
hemodynamic
variables
were recorded
on a vhs tape
using a pcm recording
adaptor (model 4000a, a. r. vetter,
rebersburg,
pa) and monitored
on a direct ink-writing
stripchart recorder (model 2800s gould, cleveland,
oh).

were initiated
2-6 wk after surgery in conscious healthy dogs, each lying
quietly on its right side in a dimly illuminated
laboratory.
while we continuously
monitored
hr, lvp, lv dp/dt, phasic
and map, phasic and mean cbf, and mean cd, intracoronary
bolus injections of 0.5,1.0, and 3.0 rig/kg  xxxd2401xxx 
(sabex,
boucherville,
canada),
a combined
pi- and pz-adrenergic
agonist, 20.0 and 50 rig/kg  xxxd2964xxx 
(pfizer, groton, ct), a
selective pz-adrenergic
agonist (21), and 10.0 rig/kg nitroglycerin (parke-davis,
scarborough,
ontario,
canada) were administered.
drugs were freshly dissolved in 0.2 ml of warm
saline (3&9”c), slowly injected intracoronary,
and then flushed
with 1.0 ml of saline delivered
with a pump-driven
syringe
over a 15-s period. a continuous
intracoronary
infusion
of
warm saline (0.4 ml/min) was used to ensure the patency of
the intracoronary
catheter
throughout
these experiments.

artery to verify absence of any change in cbf and cd related
to the injection method. the sequence of drug administration
was randomly
selected except for nitroglycerin,
which always
was given last because of its long-lasting
effects. three to five
minutes were allowed between injections
for a steady-state
baseline to return. the same procedure
was repeated after a
intracoronary
12-min administration
of 50 pg. kg-l 0rnin-l of
l-name
(sigma chemical,
st. louis, mo), delivered
in 0.5
ml/min of saline. injections
were made after at least of a
lo-min delay following the completion
of l-name delivery to
allow cd to reach a steady-state
level. an earlier study (24)
conducted in our laboratory
using a dose five times lower than
in the present study showed that the arginine
analogue
provided
a stable inhibition
of acetylcholine-induced
cbf
responses for 60-90 min thereafter.
pi-adrenergic
receptor blockade. at least 48 h later, the
same animals
were studied
after selective
pi-adrenergic
blockade with atenolol (1.0 mg/kg iv, sigma chemical)
(31)
adequacy of p1-adrenergic
blockade was demonstrated
by the
failure of  xxxd2401xxx 
(3.0 rig/kg ic) to increase lv dp/dt
after atenolol and by maintained
cbf responses to  xxxd2964xxx 
(50.0 rig/kg ic). the effects of 1.0, 3.0, and 6.0 rig/kg of
 xxxd2401xxx 
and 20.0 and 50.0 rig/kg of  xxxd2964xxx 
were
examined thereafter.
&adrenergic
receptor blockade. after at least 2 days later,
selective p1-adrenergic
activation
was achieved in the same
animals by the administration
of 1.0, 3.0, and 6.0 rig/kg of
 xxxd2401xxx 
intracoronary
after ici-118,551
(0.3 mg/kg iv,
cambridge

antagonist
(5). adequacy
of p2-adrenergic
blockade was confirmed
by the lack of cbf increases
to
 xxxd2964xxx (50.0
rig/kg ic). the same six animals were studied
under these three protocols.

stimulation.
to
consider the possibility
that the effects of l-name
on transient responses elicited by intracoronary
injections
of  xxxd2964xxx 
differed
from those occurring
under steady-state
conditions,
intracoronary
infusions of 100.0, 200.0, and 500.0
ngekg-l*rnin-l
 xxxd2964xxx 
after atenolol (1.0 mg/kg iv) were
performed
on a different
day in seven dogs.  xxxd2964xxx 
was
administered
at a rate of 0.8 ml./min until a steady-state
response was reached, 4-6 min after the beginning
of the
infusion. at least, 10 min were allowed between two infusions
for the return to a steady-state
baseline.

and controlled
cbf. we
also examined
in separate experiments,
the contribution
of
changes in cbf to  xxxd2964xxx -induced
increases in cd after
atenolol.
therefore,
the effects of an intracoronary
bolus
injection (50.0 rig/kg) and an infusion (500.0 ngekg-l*min-l)
of  xxxd2964xxx 
on cd responses were examined in six dogs, with
cbf allowed to vary or maintained
near baseline. in these
animals,
cbf was controlled
with an hydraulic
constrictor
implanted
distally
to the diameter
crystals. the injection
method was the same as described above for bolus injections
and infusions of  xxxd2964xxx .
to rule out the possibility
that the
hydraulic
occluder interfered
with increases in cd, responses
elicited by acetylcholine
(3.0 rig/kg ic, sigma chemical) were
compared with and without preventing
increases in cbf.

data analysis

results

hemodynamic
data were read directly
from the stripcharts under baseline conditions,
at peak increases of cbf
and cd after bolus injections,
and under steady-state
responses produced by intracoronary
infusions. lv dp/dt generally peaked between peak cbf and peak cd with injections
of  xxxd2401xxx 
and was therefore reported at peak cbf and
maximum
levels. data for reactive hyperemic responses were
read at peak increases in cbf and cd. with the use of a
computer-assisted
digitizing
tablet, the volume of the blood
flow deficit during coronary arterial
occlusions (i.e., the flow
debt) and the excess of blood flow that followed the release of
the occlusion
(i.e., the flow repayment)
were obtained
by
planimetry
(reported
in ml). the duration
of the debt and
repayment
were directly measured on the strip-charts.
data
are reported
as means 2 se throughout.
overall simultaneous comparisons
of baseline
levels (before the various
drugs) before and after l-name
were made with two-way
analysis
of variance
for repeated
measurements
(13, 33).
through the use of a similar approach, separate analyses for
responses to  xxxd2401xxx 
and  xxxd2964xxx 
or reactive hyperemia before and after l-name were conducted. comparisons
of lvp, lv dp/dt, map, and hr at peak cbf and cd or
maximum
levels to baselines were made with one-way analysis of variance for repeated measurements
followed by bonferroni’s t-tests to isolate specific contrasts. responses to acetylcholine and nitroglycerin

were
compared
with paired t-tests. responses

adequacy of l+adrenergic
blockade with atenolol
(1.0 mg/kg iv) was confirmed by the reduction of lv
dp/dt responses to intracoronary
 xxxd2401xxx 
(3.0
rig/kg) from 36 t 3% before atenolol to 2 t 1% after
p1-adrenergic
blockade. cbf and cd responses to
intracoronary
 xxxd2964xxx 
(50.0 rig/kg) averaged 109 2
16% and 0.16 t 0.02 mm, respectively, before atenolol,
and the responses were not altered after p1-adrenergic
blockade (95 -+ 19% and 0.14 t 0.03 mm, respectively).
after l+adrenergic
blockade, intracoronary
injections of  xxxd2401xxx 
(3.0 rig/kg) increased cbf by
74 ? 12% and cd by 0.14 ? 0.03 mm, and intracoronary  xxxd2964xxx 
(50.0 rig/kg) increased cbf by 95 t
19% and cd by 0.14 _t 0.03 mm, as illustrated in fig. 2.
l-name decreased (p < 0.01) baseline cd without
altering cbf (table 2). under these conditions,  xxxd2401xxx  increased cbf (38 t 7%) less (p < 0.05).
 xxxd2964xxx 
also resulted in smaller (p < 0.01) cbf
responses (40 ? 12%). l-name abolished cd increases
to  xxxd2401xxx  and  xxxd2964xxx .
overall, cbf increases produced by  xxxd2401xxx 
and  xxxd2964xxx 
after p1-adrenergic blockade were reduced after blockade of no formation with intracoronary l-name, and cd responses were prevented after
the arginine analogue, as reported in fig. 3. except for
coronary responses, other hemodynamic effects of intracoronary  xxxd2401xxx

or conductance vessels, which may display different
properties. our approach allowed evaluation of specific
responses of large and small coronary vessels, thereby
permitting
isolation of receptor-operated
effects from
flow-dependent
responses of large epicardial coronary
arteries. in this connection, pz-adrenergic vasodilation
of large epicardial
coronary arteries in the present
study was a secondary phenomenon
not directly triggered by a receptor-operated
process. flow-dependent
effects were primarily
involved in p2-adrenergic dilation of large epicardial coronary arteries as suggested
by the failure of bolus injections or infusions of  xxxd2964xxx  to dilate these vessels when cbf increases
were prevented.
consequently,
in vivo, p2-adrenergic
receptors had little direct influence on vasomotor tone
of large epicardial coronary arteries. in contrast, p1adrenergic effects prevailed in receptor-operated

no formation
was therefore pivotal in l&-adrenergic
dilation of large epicardial coronary arteries. a receptoroperated mechanism
was not primarily
involved. a
flow-dependent
process secondary to the dilation of

dilation of large epicardial coronary arteries. in contrast, p1-adrenergic responses did not involve the larginine/no pathway.
the present data may help to explain the apparent
discrepancy between in vitro studies, where p1-adrenergic is the dominant
receptor subtype involved in the
relaxation of isolated coronary arteries (20,22, zs), and

tion of these large epicardial coronary arteries in our
conscious dogs. this conclusion is consistent with a
recent study by ghaleh et al. (12) showing that &adrenergic dilation of large epicardial coronary vessels
is an endothelium-dependent
phenomenon involving a
flow-dependent
process. in contrast, pi-adrenergic dilation of large epicardial coronary arteries is endothelium independent (12) consistent with our finding that
l-name did not alter pi-adrenergic responses.
in an earlier study from our laboratory, b-adrenergic
dilation of resistance coronary vessels was partially
antagonized
by l-name, even when cbf increases
were prevented (23). this suggests that p-adrenergic
receptor activation involved no formation in coronary
microvessels as a primary phenomenon.
in contrast,
the involvement
of no formation
in norepinephrine

effects on resistance coronary vessels was reported to
be largely flow dependent (29), depite the direct stimulatory effect of uz-adrenergic receptors on the, release of
endothelium-derived
relaxing factor (2, 8). in other
species or vascular beds, no formation is also involved
in b-adrenergic dilation of resistance vessels (11, 14,
32). in isolated, large epicardial canine coronary arteries, endothelial denudation had slight (4,25) inhibitory
effects on p-adrenergic responses, which may have
involved prostacyclin
formation
(25). others (3, 20)
have reported no effect of endothelial removal or blockade of no formation
on p-adrenergic
relaxation of
canine coronary arteries. conceivably, p-adrenergiccoupled no formation may be more important in the
vasomotor control of resistance than conductance coronary arteries in dogs. in contrast to studies conducted

in vitro, our finding that l-name blocked l&adrenergic dilation of large coronary arteries suggests a pivotal
role of no formation in that process. the fact that no
formation
was triggered
by cbf increases explains
why isolated vessels did not display significant nodependent, pz-adrenergic dilation. therefore, pi-adrenergic effects, independent
of no formation,
prevail in
receptor-operated
dilation of conductance coronary arteries in vitro and in vivo.
no formation is considered as the essential intermediate linking changes in vascular shear rate and vascular relaxation (6, 27). blockade of flow-dependent
dilation by analogues of l-arginine is consistent with this
contention
(6, 27). an increased basal coronary tone
could conceivably lead to smaller flow-dependent
dilation of cd after l-name. however, preconstriction
of
large coronary arteries with  xxxd2021xxx , indomethacin,
or diclofenac failed to alter the relationship
between
changes in cbf and cd, as reported earlier (18). thus
blockade of no formation rather than decreased base-

25.0

0.0

line cd most likely accounted for the reduction
of
flow-dependent
cd dilation after l-name. in the present study, significant blockade of no formation in large
coronary arteries was achieved as indicated by the fall
in baseline cd (6, 7), blunted cd responses elicited by
transient coronary artery occlusions (6, 27), and augmented cd responses with nitroglycerin
after l-name
(19). the fact that l-name administration
or the
prevention
of cbf increases by arterial constriction
both antagonized
pz-adrenergic dilation of cd highlights the causal relationship
between no formation
and flow increases. in contrast, the failure of l-name
to antagonize pi-adrenergic dilation of large epicardial
coronary arteries suggests that no formation was not a
major intermediate
in that process, consistent with
studies conducted in vitro (3, 4, 20, 25) and with the
study by ghaleh et al. (12) in vivo where p1-adrenergic
dilation was endothelium
independent.

could have contributed
to cd increases. the small
amplitude of cbf increases triggered by pi-adrenergic
stimulation
may explain why l-name did not significantly reduce cd responses
by blocking
a flowdependent component. at the level of resistance coronary vessels, the effects of l-name
on reactive
hyperemic responses were less striking
than those
produced on large coronary vessels. l-name interfered
more with the volume and duration of flow repayment
than with the peak increases in cbf following the
release of transient
coronary artery occlusions. this
pattern of l-name effects on reactive hyperemic responses is similar to that reported by other investigators after blockade of no formation (6,27,34). substantial blockade of no formation
in resistance coronary
vessels was further illustrated
by the selective antagonism of cbf responses created by l$-adrenergic
agonists in the present study.
our data imply that no formation
is not directly
involved in p-adrenergic
dilation of large epicardial
coronary arteries, which is consistent with most (3, 20,
25) but not all (4) of the studies conducted in canine
isolated coronary arteries. this conclusion cannot be
directly extended to other species where the mechanisms involved in p-adrenergic dilation are apparently
different from those of canine vessels. for instance, in
rat thoracic aortas, p-adrenergic
dilation
has been
reported to be completely (15) or partially (32) endothelium dependent and endothelium
independent
(9). in
hamster thoracic aorta, jackson and busse (19) reported that  xxxd2401xxx -induced
relaxation
did not
require
an intact endothelium.

p1-adrenergic receptors and prevented by endothelium
removal (1).
we were surprised that p2-adrenergic receptor activation completely failed to dilate large epicardial coronary arteries given the fact that a small population of
l&adrenergic
receptors have been identified in canine
large coronary arteries (22) and that some of these
p-adrenergic
receptors may be located on en .dothelial
cells (26). our data suggest that pz-adrenergic receptors found on large epicardial coronary arteries are
apparently not functionally
coupled to no synthase, in
contrast to those of resistance coronary vessels. this
may explain why no formation
triggered
by p2adrenergic stimulation
was flow dependent and why in
vitro l&adrenergic
receptors have little influence on
vascular tone of conductance coronary arteries (12, 20,
22,28).
in an earlier study conducted by vatner et al. (31) in
conscious dogs, selective pz-adrenergic activation
dilated large coronary arteries, but the involvement
of
endothelium-dependent
no formation or the contrib ution of a flow-dependent
process were not considered. in
a recent study, where the role of no formation was not
specifically considered, endothelial denudation blunted
pz-adrenergic
responses, a flow-dependent
phenomenon, without altering p1-adrenergic dilator responses
(12). in other species, however, large coronary arteries
differed from canine coronary vessels, since significant
dilation to both pl- and pz-adrenergic agonists was
observed in conscious calves in the absence of changes
in cbf (30).
we were concerned that a lack of responses of large
epicardial coronary arteries to pz-adrenergic agoni sts

p-adrenergic

dilation

could be related to our experimental
approach. the
intracoronary
delivery of bolus injections of l&-agonists
could have failed to directly dilate large epicardial
coronary arteries because of the short duration
of
exposure to the drugs. to rule out this possibility,
sustained intracoronary
infusions of  xxxd2964xxx 
were
performed.
an increase in cd, independent
of cbf
increases, could not be demonstrated
under these conditions. an inadequate mixing of the drug and a potential
streaming
phenomenon
between the site of injection
and the site of cd measurements
could have intervened. the fact that pl-adrenergic
dilation was not
prevented by l-name and that acetylcholine-induced
increases in cd were maintained
when cbf was
controlled argues against this possibility. if streaming
was involved, l-name should have blocked p1-adrenergic effects on cd as it did for p2-adrenergic responses
because flow-dependent
effects had intervened. we also
considered that the inflation of the hydraulic cons trictor to prevent cbf increases may have directly interfered with increases in cd. the fact that acetylcholine
produced similar increases in cd with normal and
controlled cbf argues against this possibility.
in conclusion, p2-adrenergic dilation of large epicardial coronary arteries involves no formation through a
flow-dependent
phenomenon
rather than a receptoroperated process. in contrast, pl-adrenergic
activation
produces epicardial coronary dilation independent
of
an l-name-sensitive
mechanism.
