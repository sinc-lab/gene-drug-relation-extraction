histidine triad nucleotide-binding proteins (hint)2 are
members of the histidine triad (hit) protein superfamily of
nucleotidyltransferases and hydrolyases (1). hit proteins are
named for the conserved nucleotide binding motif containing
the sequence his-x-his-x-his-xx, in which x is a hydrophobic
amino acid. the hit proteins have been classified into three
subfamilies according to their enzymatic function, sequence
composition, and structural similarity; the hint branch, the
 xxxg797xxx  ( xxxg797xxx ) branch, and the galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (galt) branch (1).
the hint branch is the most ancient and can be found in
archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotae. hints are homodimeric
proteins that have been found to be purine phosphoramidases
(2–5). recently, we have demonstrated that lysyl-adenylate
(lysyl-amp) generated by bacterial and human lysyl-trna synthetases ( xxxg1225xxx ) are also substrates for the respective bacterial
and human hints (6). escherichia coli hint knock-out mutants
exhibited salt-dependent cell growth, whereas  xxxg1050xxx  knock-out
mice have an increased susceptibility to 7, 12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (dmba)-induced ovarian and mammary
tumors by the carcinogen dmba and increased incidence of
spontaneous tumors (2, 7, 8). in addition,  xxxg1050xxx  has been
shown to have a potential role on cancer cells apoptosis and
p53 expression (9). the mechanism(s) by which such a conserved protein as hint effects such a variety of biological
processes has not been fully elucidated. eukaryotic  xxxg1050xxx  has
been shown to associate with, and suppress the ␤-catenin
wnt signaling pathway transcriptional activity by direct
interactions with reptin and pontin (10).  xxxg1050xxx  has also been
associated with transcription factors such as,  xxxg725xxx  (11),
mitf (12, 13), and usf2 (14). in addition, the interactions
between mitf and usf2 appear to be mediated by  xxxg1225xxx 
(13–15).

 xxxg1050xxx  is a homodimeric protein and member of the ubiquitous hit superfamily.  xxxg1050xxx  catalyzes the hydrolysis of
purine phosphoramidates and lysyl-adenylate generated by
 xxxg1225xxx  ( xxxg1225xxx ). to determine the importance
of homodimerization on the biological and catalytic activity
of  xxxg1050xxx , the dimer interface of human  xxxg1050xxx  (hhint1) was
destabilized by replacement of val97 of hhint1 with asp, glu,
or arg. the mutants were shown to exist as monomers in
solution by a combination of size exclusion chromatograph,
static light scattering, and chemically induced dimerization
studies. circular dichroism studies revealed little difference
between the stability of the v97d, v97e, and wild-type
hhint1. relative to wild-type and the v97e mutant, however,
significant perturbation of the v97d mutant structure was
observed. hhint1 was shown to prefer 3-indolepropionic
acyl-adenylate (aipa) over tryptamine adenosine phosphoramidate monoester (tpad). wild-type hhint1 was found to
be 277- and 1000-fold more efficient (kcat/km values) than the
v97e and v97d mutants, respectively. adenylation of wildtype, v97d, and v97e hhint1 by human  xxxg1225xxx  was shown to
correlate with the mutant kcat/km values using 3-indolepropionic acyl-adenylate as a substrate, but not tryptamine adenosine phosphoramidate monoester. significant perturbations
of the active site residues were not detected by molecular
dynamics simulations of the hhint1s. taken together, these
results demonstrate that for hhint1; 1) the efficiency (kcat/
km) of acylated amp hydrolysis, but not maximal catalytic
turnover (kcat), is dependent on homodimerization and 2) the
hydrolysis of lysyl-amp generated by  xxxg1225xxx  is not dependent
on homodimerization if the monomer structure is similar to
the wild-type structure.

experimental procedures
construction of plasmids—the dhfr fusion protein was
constructed based on the pjlcf15dmh plasmid template
previously constructed in our laboratory (2, 26). the
pjlcf15dmh plasmid encodes a fusion protein containing a
flag peptide at the n terminus of l54f-e. coli dhfr, linked
by a 15-amino acid linker to hhint1. the following mutants
were generated by using the quikchange site-directed
mutagenesis kit (stratagene); the sequence of primers was listed
in supplemental data (table s1). the first mutagenesis was car-

ried out to change the l54f back to wild-type dhfr with two
primers (f54l-f and f54l-r). the flag peptide was deleted
with primers (d-flag-f and d-flag-r) to generate ptfc15dh.
the ptfc15dh was then truncated to a 7-amino acid linker
with primers 7dh-f and 7dh-r to create wild-type ptfc7dh.
the v97d-, v97e-, and v97r-ptfc7dh plasmids were generated with primers (v97d-f, v97d-r, v97e-f, v97e-r, v97r-f,
and v97r-r) with wild-type plasmid ptfc7dh. v97dptfc15dh and v97e-ptfc15dh were generated with primers (v97d-f, v97d-r, v97e-f, and v97e-r) and with the
ptfc15dh plasmid containing a thrombin-sensitive linker
between dhfr and hhint1. plasmids containing mutant dna
were sequenced by automated sequencing (advanced genetic
analysis center, university of minnesota).
protein expression and purification—to avoid wild-type
e. coli hint contaminant, all expression plasmids were transformed into the e. coli hint disrupted strain bb2 as previously
described (2). purification of wild-type fusion protein was published. cell growth and cell lysate extractions were as previously
described (26). the same purification procedure for each
mutant was employed. the cell lysates containing overexpressed v97d-, v97e-, or v97r-hhint1-dhfr (7-amino acid
linker) were loaded onto a methotrexate (mtx)-agarose column (sigma) and the column was washed with buffer a (20 mm
tris, ph 7.0, 1 mm edta, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 ml) and 1 m
nacl in buffer a (800 ml), and the fusion protein was eluted
with trimethoprim (150 ␮m in buffer a containing 1 m nacl).
fractions (9 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and an
aliquot (10 ␮l) of each fraction was assayed for protein concentration with the bradford dye reagent (bio-rad). fractions containing more than 0.1 mg/ml of protein were analyzed by
4 –12% sds-page (invitrogen). fractions containing the
desired protein (⬃32.5 kda) were combined and folate was
removed by exchanging to buffer a using an amicon stirred cell
with a ym-10 membrane (millipore). the protein solution was
applied onto a deae column that had been equilibrated with
buffer a. the column was eluted with 0 – 0.5 m nacl gradient in
buffer a. fractions (9 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 1.5
ml/min. the absorbance at 280 and 260 nm of each fraction was
determined. aliquots (10 ␮l) of the selected fractions were analyzed by sds-page and assayed for phosphoramidase activity
by fluorescence assay. the fractions containing the highest
phosphoramidase specific activity were combined and concentrated with an amicon stirred cell. to purify native v97d and
v97e mutants, thrombin (10 units/mg) was used to cleave the
corresponding dhfr-hhint1 fusion proteins (15-amino acid
linker), reaction mixture was applied onto a deae column. the
column was eluted as described above. glycerol was added to a
final concentration of 10% and purified proteins were stored at
⫺80 °c.

hhint1-dhfr (1 mg/ml, 31 ␮m, 500 ␮l) or v97d hhint1dhfr (0.7 mg/ml, 22 ␮m, 500 ␮l) was subjected to size exclusion chromatography (superdex g200, ge healthcare) and
eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with p500 buffer (0.5 m nacl,

through a 0.02-␮m filter) and monitored by a in-line multiangle

eukaryotes. like  xxxg1050xxx ,  xxxg797xxx  is also a homodimer and tumor
suppressor (17). human  xxxg797xxx  is a ap3a hydrolyase as well as
phosphoramidase (18, 19). the precise mechanism of action by
which it affects tumor development is not well understood,
although site-directed mutagenesis studies have indicated that
the tumor suppressor function of  xxxg797xxx  is likely not dependent
on its  xxxg797xxx  activity (20). in contrast to the first two
branches, the galt branch has been shown to be the second
enzyme in the leloir pathway necessary for galactose utilization
(21). although, galt is a homodimer with little overall
sequence homology with hhint1 or  xxxg797xxx  proteins, it does share
some three-dimensional structure similarity (22).
the mechanism of the phosphoramidase and aminoacylamp hydrolase activity catalyzed by hints has been proposed
to follow a reaction pathway similar to that for galt and  xxxg797xxx  (1,
6). in the first step, the active site is nucleotidylated by nucleophilic attack at the substrate phosphorous by a conserved active
site histidine (his112 for hhint1). the nucleoside monophosphate product is subsequently released after water hydrolysis of
the enzyme his-amp intermediate. evidence in support of formation of this intermediate with both the bacterial and human
hint has been obtained by radiolabeling experiments with
 xxxg1225xxx  and [␣-32p]atp (6). x-ray crystal structure and size
exclusion chromatography analyses have revealed that hhint1
exists as a homodimer (2, 23, 24). similar to other homodimeric
enzymes, such as bacterial alkaline phosphatase, each monomer contains a well separated active site that does not participate in the dimer interface (25). nevertheless, the c terminus of
each monomer does form a range of contacts with the adjacent
monomer in close proximity to the active site.
to the best of our knowledge no attempt has been made to
characterize the role of protein dimerization on stability and
catalysis of hit, in general, and hhint1, in particular. therefore, based on an analysis of the crystal structure of hhint1, we
hypothesized that the replacement of an interface residue,
val97, with more sterically demanding and charged residues
would allow the effect of destabilization of the dimer interface
on stability and catalysis to be addressed. the val97 to asp, glu,
and arg point site mutation were prepared characterized by cd
spectroscopy, thermal stability, multiangle static light scattering, size-exclusion chromatography (sec), and molecular
modeling. the effect of dimerization on the phosphoramidate
hydrolase activity was assessed by steady-state kinetics,
whereas the effect on acyl-amp hydrolase activity was determined by steady-state kinetics with a new fluorogenic substrate. the effect of homodimerization on the hydrolysis of
lysyl-amp produced by  xxxg1225xxx  was also determined.

vacuo, the residue was dissolved in water (1 ml) and lyophilized
to afford the title compound as a white solid (14 mg, yield 14%);

steady-state kinetics—steady-state kinetic studies were carried out with tryptamine 5⬘-adenosine phosphoramidate
(tpad) or aipa as substrate and with the fluorescent activity
assay as described (5). excitation wavelength was set at 280 nm,
fluorescence emission was measured at 360 nm, and excitation
and emission slits were set  xxxd1891xxx  nm for concentrations of substrates ranging from 0.05 to 1 ␮m for wild-type and 5 nm for
concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 ␮m for v97d, v97e, and
v97r mutants. due to the inner filter effect, the highest substrate concentration within the linearity of fluorescence intensity is 50 ␮m. the fluorescence intensity was monitored for 2
min to obtain the baseline and allow the temperature to stabilize at 25 °c, and then enzyme (wild-type, 0.5 pmol; v97d
mutant, 50 pmol; v97e mutant, 50 pmol; v97r mutant, 25
pmol) was added to initiate the reaction. the increase of fluorescence intensity was recorded for 2–10 min according to the
rate of hydrolysis. the michaelis-menten constants, kcat (s⫺1)
and km (␮m), were determined by jump in nonlinear regression or double-reciprocal plots.
assay of ap3a and ap4a hydrolysis—a coupled assay was
applied to determine the rate of hydrolysis of ap3a and ap4a as
described for human  xxxg797xxx  (18). initial rates were measured in a
cary 50 spectrophotometer at 25 °c. ap3a or ap4a (100 ␮m)
was prepared in the assay solution and enzyme (500 pmol) was
added to reaction mixture.
lysyl-amp-dependent adenylation of hints by human
 xxxg1225xxx —human  xxxg1225xxx  (1 ␮l, 6 ␮m) was incubated with buffer b

[␣-32p]atp (2 ␮l, 3.15 ␮m, 800 ci/mmol, mp biomedicals) at
23 °c for 1 min followed by addition of proteins (2 ␮l, 12.5 ␮m)
and incubated for an additional 1 min. the concentrations in
the reaction mixture were  xxxg1225xxx , 0.85 ␮m; lysine, 28.5 ␮m;
 xxxg1804xxx , 0.02 unit/␮l; [␣-32p]atp, 0.9 ␮m; and hhint1 proteins,
3.6 ␮m. the reaction was terminated and analyzed as described
(6).
molecular modeling—a total of three molecular dynamics
simulations were performed. the considered models were:
wild-type monomer, v97e mutant monomer, and v97d
mutant monomer. the initial coordinates were taken from the
crystal structure of the hhint1 dimer, which was determined in
complex with  xxxd2933xxx  (protein data bank code 1av5) (24).
all non-protein atoms of the model were deleted to study the
unbound protein. the monomers were constructed by deleting
the chain b of the original model. mutations were performed
using the biopolymer module of the sybyl package (sybyl 7.0).

source (dawn eos, wyatt technology), a refractive index
detector ( xxxd3238xxx ), and a uv detector (beckman gold 166). data
were collected across a range of angles from 14.5 to 163.3
degrees: 14.5, 25.9, 34.8, 42.8, 51.5, 60, 69.3, 79.9, 100.3, 110.7,
121.2, 132.2, 142.5, 152.5, and 163.3 degrees. the instrument
was calibrated with a molecular standard, bovine  xxxg124xxx  sample (1 mg/ml, 500 ␮l). all samples were filtered with a
0.2-␮m filter just prior to analysis. molecular masses were calculated with the astra software package (27).
size exclusion chromatography—protein samples were prepared in p500 buffer with 5% (v/v) glycerol. samples were
mixed in 200-␮l vial inserts (chromtech). the molecular
weight of recombinant purified fusion proteins was analyzed by
analytical gel filtration chromatography on a superdex  xxxg75xxx  size
exclusion column (ge healthcare) and the proteins were eluted
with p500 buffer. the retention time of proteins was monitored
by absorbance at 280 nm with an in-line uv detector (beckman
gold 168) and a fp1520 fluorescence detector (jasco). the
molecular standards used were blue dextran (200 kda), albumin (66 kda),  xxxg632xxx -1ddg (36 kda), carbonic anhydrase (29
kda),  xxxg569xxx  (12.4 kda), and aprotinin (6.5 kda) (sigma).
circular dichroism (cd) spectroscopy—cd spectra of proteins were obtained  xxxd1891xxx  °c with a j710 spectropolarimeter
(jasco) equipped with a temperature-controlled water bath.
hhint1-dhfr fusion proteins at concentrations ranging from
3.2 to 5.4 ␮m in buffer a and native wild-type hhint1, v97d,
and v97e proteins at 5 ␮m were analyzed in a quartz cuvette
with path length of 1 mm, and spectra were accumulated and
averaged over nine scans. the buffer background was subtracted from the protein spectrum with excel. the cd signal at
207 or 222 nm was monitored as the temperature increased
from 10 to 80 °c over 84 min to determine the thermal denaturation of wild-type and mutant of hhint1-dhfr and hhint1
proteins.
synthesis of adenosine 5⬘- xxxd2351xxx  adenylate
(aipa)—the title compound was synthesized according to the
method by berg (28), with a minor modification.3 thus, to a
cooled suspension (ice-bath) of indole-3- xxxd3029xxx  (0.040
g, 0.20 mmol) and amp (0.067 g, 0.19 mmol) in a water/pyridine mixture (1:4, 5 ml) was added in hcl (8 n, 0.2 ml), dropwise
with stirring. to the resultant, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (1.03
g, 5 mmol) dissolved in pyridine (2 ml) was added and stirring
continued. the progress of the reaction was monitored using
31
p nmr and mass spectrometry. after 6 h, no further increase
in the product concentration was observed, at which point the
reaction was quenched by addition of acetone (15 ml) chilled to
⫺15 °c. the white precipitate thus obtained was filtered rapidly with the aid of suction, washed sequentially with a cold
acetone/ethanol (60:40) mixture and  xxxd2052xxx  at 0 °c, and
air-dried on the filter under suction. the crude product was
suspended in cold water (2 ml) and rapidly filtered to remove
dicyclohexylurea. the filtrate was acidified to ph 3 using 1 n
hcl, and poured into ethanol (10 ml, ⫺20 °c). after overnight
storing at ⫺20 °c, a white precipitate was formed that was collected by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold ethanol, and

results
design of monomeric human  xxxg1050xxx —the homodimeric
structure of hhint1 is shown in fig. 1a with val97 highlighted at
the dimer interface. the interface encompasses 42% (4037 å2)
of the homodimer surface area and is composed of 12 residues
residing on five ␤ strands and two ␣ helices (23, 24). whereas
the majority of the interfacial interactions are across a rather
flat surface, the c-terminal loop of each protomer forms a series
of bridging contacts with its partner in close proximity to the
adjacent active site (fig. 1b). inspection of the interface
revealed a set of core residues, tyr94–arg95–met96–val97–
val98–asn99–glu100 (fig. 1c), that upon mutagenesis might
lead to dimer destabilization. in particular, the hydrophobic
interactions between the side chains of val97 appeared to be
strategically placed for the promotion of dimer destabilization
when substituted with a larger, positively or negatively charged
residue (fig. 1d). the substitution of charged residues, such as
asp, arg, and glu into a protein dimer or oligomer interface has
been shown to be a viable approach for preparing monomeric
enzymes (25, 37–39).
expression and purification of monomeric hhint1 proteins—
as previously described, we have developed a protein expression protocol for hhint1 as a fusion protein to e. coli dhfr (2).
this approach facilitates the isolation of hints that are unable
to be purified by amp affinity column by taking advantage of
the binding of dhfr to a mtx affinity column. wild-type
hhint1-dhfr fusion protein was purified by an amp affinity
chromatography as described previously (2). however, the
v97d, v97e, and v97r hhint1-dhfr mutants could only be
isolated by mtx affinity chromatography, because initial
attempts to use amp affinity chromatography were unsuccessful. to remove small amounts of truncated fusion protein, the
combined protein solution after mtx affinity chromatography

developed for proteins (31). to remove bad contacts, the systems were first minimized in vacuum, using 1000 steps of the
steepest descent algorithm. next, each system was included in a
rectangular box in which each edge of the box was placed at 0.9
nm away from the protein surface. the boxes were filled with
pre-equilibrated spc water molecules (32). the systems were
neutralized with sodium counterions. from this point on, periodic boundary conditions and the ewald summation method
for long range electrostatics were applied (33). the lincs algorithm was used to constrain the stretching modes involving
hydrogen atoms (34). for each system, a simulation of the water
molecules and counterions, at 300 k and 1 atm, was carried out
to adjust them to the potential exerted by the protein, and to
allow cavities on the surface of the protein to be filled. in this
step, the protein atoms were kept restrained by using the conventional procedure of applying harmonic potentials. the
equations of motion were integrated using the verlet leapfrog
algorithm (35). temperature and pressure were controlled
using the berendsen approach, in which external baths are
weakly coupled (29). each system was softly heated to 300 k
using six blocks of simulation at constant pressure (1 atm) (36).
molecular dynamics simulations were started once the systems
equilibrated at 300 k and 1 atm. each simulation was performed using a time step of 0.002 ps and a total time of 10 ns.

was further purified with a deae anion exchange column. even
though sds-page indicated the homogeneity of the purified
dhfr fusion proteins (data now shown) the analysis from sec
indicated the presence of a small amount of truncated v97e
hhint1-dhfr (7%) and v97r hhint1-dhfr (22%) (data now
shown). to obtain native v97d and v97e mutants, dhfr was
removed by thrombin cleavage of the 15-amino acid linker
fusion proteins followed by a deae column.
molecular mass determination by static light scattering—
static light scattering and size exclusion experiments were
carried out to evaluate the apparent molecular weight of
hhint1-dhfr fusion proteins. a superdex g200 sec column with in-line static light scattering detector was
employed to assess the molecular weights of the wild-type
and v97d hhint1-dhfr fusion proteins. as shown in fig.

molecular mass of 64.24 ⫾ 0.07 kda, consistent with the
protein being a homodimer, whereas the v97d hhint1dhfr mutant was found to be a monomer with a molecular
mass of 40.2 ⫾ 0.8 kda (fig. 2b).

kda for the dimer. in contrast, the v97d, v97e, and v97r
hhint1-dhfr mutants all eluted at 21.5 min, with our reference protein ( xxxg632xxx -1ddg, mass 36 kda, data not shown) in
good agreement with the expected molecular mass for the
monomeric protein (32.1 kda). typical sec chromatograms of
the wild-type, v97d, and v97e hhint1-dhfr proteins (5– 6
␮m) are shown in fig. 3. various lower concentrations (5–500
nm) of wild-type were examined (data not shown) and only
dimer could be detected at a concentration as low as 5 nm (the
detection limit); thus, the dissociation constant (kd) of dimer
formation for wild-type hhint1 is less than 5 nm. in contrast,
higher concentrations of monomers were subjected to sec
analysis and only monomer could be detected at a concentration of 25 ␮m for v97e hhint1-dhfr and 20 ␮m for v97d
hhint1-dhfr (data not shown); therefore, the kd of monomeric mutants is higher than 25 ␮m. thus the kd for the wildtype and v97e hhint1-dhfr fusion proteins differs by at least
a factor of 104. the native v97d and v97e hhint1 mutants
were found to exist as monomers in solution (data not shown).
chemically induced dimerization—our laboratory has
developed a system to study chemically induced protein
dimerization of wild-type e. coli dhfr by bis-methotrexate
ligand (bis-mtx-c9) (40, 41). to further confirm the existence of stable monomers in solution, the v97d hhint1-dhfr
(5 ␮m) was mixed with various equivalents of chemical dimerizer (bis-mtx-c9, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2 eq), then subjected to
superdex  xxxg75xxx  column chromatography as described previously
(40, 41). the overlaid traces clearly demonstrated the amount
of dimer formation increased with increasing amounts of added
dimerizer (fig. 4). the overlaid chromatograms of wild-type
dimer, chemically induced dimer of v97d mutant, and monomeric v97d mutant are shown in supplemental data fig. 1a.
furthermore, the other monomeric mutants v97e (5 ␮m) and
v97r (2.5 ␮m)) were mixed with 2 eq of bis-mtx-c9. the
overlaid chromatograms of dimerized v97e and v97r mutants
versus the corresponding monomers are displayed in supplemental data fig. s1.
secondary structure analysis—cd spectra of the wild-type
and monomeric mutants were determined in the far-uv region
(190 –260 nm). the result was expressed as the mean residue
ellipticities. as can been seen in fig. 5a, the cd spectra of the
dhfr fusion protein for wild-type, v97d, v97e, and v97r
enzymes are nearly superimposable and consistent with a
nearly identical combination of ␣-helical and ␤-sheet secondary structural elements. the cd spectra of the recombinant
wild-type, v97d, and v97e hhint1 were determined. the similar spectra observed for the wild-type and v97e mutant indicated that, whereas the ␣-helical structure of the mutant protein has likely been slightly decreased, overall the secondary
structure of the mutant was not significantly perturbed relative to wild-type. however, the shift of the minimum point
from 222 to 207 nm for v97d mutant indicates that the
secondary structure has been significantly perturbed relative
to wild-type, with the mutant protein likely containing a
higher percentage of random coil content (fig. 5b).
thermal stability—cd was also used to determine the thermal stability of the wild-type and mutant dhfr fusion proteins

activity of hhint1. whereas the kcat
values for wild-type and monomeric

the km values for v97d and v97e

1000-fold, respectively. for v97e

proteins, the km values were found
to be greater than 50 ␮m (the highest applicable substrate concentration due to fluorescence inner filter effect). consequently, the

the v97e and v97r hhint1-dhfr

molecular modeling—three molecular dynamics simulations
were carried out on the wild type-hhint dimer, and the v97e and
v97d monomers. to analyze the stability of the trajectories we
calculated the root mean square
(r.m.s.) deviation related to the initial
structure (crystal structure of the
hhint1 dimer, pdb code 1av5) (24).
the r.m.s. deviation was calculated
using only ␣-carbon atoms. the wildtype dimer showed low r.m.s. deviation values, indicating that no significant conformational changes have
occurred during the simulation. for
the v97e and v97d monomers, pronounced conformational changes
were observed. for the monomers,
the r.m.s. deviation stabilized after ⬃6
ns, with the r.m.s. deviation for v97e
monomer reaching values greater
than 0.3 nm. a large percentage of the
effect on the r.m.s. deviation appeared
to be due to the flexibility of the n and

interaction observed (data not shown). nevertheless, relative to
wild-type, v97e and v97d exhibited little difference in positioning of the catalytic residues, his51, his110, his112, and his114
(fig. 7b). a slightly more perturbed orientation was observed
for his114 of the v97d mutant. however, this appears likely to
be due to slight differences in the position of the backbone and
not to a direct interaction with the mutated side chain.

discussion
the physiological role of the hint protein has not yet been
determined, even though it is the most ancient and conserved branch of the hit protein superfamily. to date, all of
the members of the hit superfamily have been shown to
exist as homodimers (2, 22, 24, 42). whereas the native function of hints remains unknown, the, rabbit, human, yeast,
and bacterial proteins have been shown to be  xxxd2705xxx  phosphoramidases (2, 3). site-directed mutagenesis
and x-ray crystallographic studies have revealed the hhint1
nucleotide-binding sites, which are positioned ⬃180° from
each other and 25 å apart (fig. 1a) (23, 24). consequently,
the dimer interface does not contribute residues to the
respective active sites, with one exception. the c terminus
of each protomer forms a loop that protrudes across the
interface and places trp123 at the far end of the adjacent
active side (fig. 1, a and b).
after replacing the selected hot spot on the dimer interface
with large and charged residues, asp, glu, or arg, the overexpressed mutants lost their ability to bind to the amp affinity
column; thus, the mtx affinity column was in turn used to
purify mutants. a combination of evidence from size exclusion
chromatography and multiangle static light scattering, a well
known method for measurement of absolute molecular weight
of macromolecules in solution (27, 39), revealed that all three
mutants were successfully destabilized to form monomers in

solution (figs. 2 and 3). these results were further supported by
utilizing a bis-mtx-c9 ligand to dimerize the existing monomers (fig. 4, and supplemental data fig. 1). the detailed design
of this interesting chemically induced protein dimerization
method was published previously (40) and first applied here to
prove the existence of monomeric mutants.
to probe the effects of hhint1 monomerization on protein
structure, the v97d and v97e mutants of hhint1-dhfr and
hhint1 were characterized by cd spectroscopy (16). little difference in the cd spectra or thermal stability between the wildtype hhint1-dhfr and the mutant fusion proteins was
observed (fig. 5, a and c). because it is possible that changes in
the secondary structure of hhint1 could be masked by dhfr,
we carried out analyses of the recombinant versions of wildtype hhint1 and the monomeric mutants, v97d and v97e. cd
spectra for both the wild-type and v97e mutant exhibited similar minima. a larger structural perturbation was observed for
the v97d mutant, because the mean residue ellipticities minimum for the mutant shifted from 222 to 207 nm. this change is
consistent with a possible increase in random coil content. in
addition, although the thermal stability of the wild-type, v97d,
and v97e mutants were similar, the degree of change for the

(6).

efficiency of the v97d mutant, relative to the v97e mutant, are
quite subtle.
whereas it appears that hint dimerization is a pre-requisite
for efficient phosphoramidate and acyl-adenylate hydrolysis,
why hhint1, unlike  xxxg797xxx , does not carry out ap4a and ap3a
hydrolysis is not apparent. upon close inspection of the structures of both hhint1 and  xxxg797xxx , the c-terminal loop of hhint1
could be shown to occupy a potential binding site for the substrate for  xxxg797xxx , ap3a. therefore, we hypothesized that removal
of the interaction with the c terminus of the other monomer
might rescue the  xxxg797xxx  activity of hhint1. nevertheless, no activity (⬍0.0002 s⫺1) for either wild-type or monomeric enzymes was observed. consequently, although binding
studies claim to have shown direct binding of ap4a to hhint1,
the removal of the sterically bulky c-terminal loops does not
appear to rescue the potential ap3a or ap4a hydrolysis activity
(13).
to conclude, whereas the hhint1 dimer interface does not
contribute to significant stabilization of each protomer, it is

v97d mutant was considerably larger than for either wild-type
or v97e mutant. further indicating significant structural perturbations by the  xxxd233xxx  substitution.
consistent with the structural studies, both for tpad and
aipa, the kcat value for v97e mutant was closer in value to
wild-type than the kcat value for v97d mutant (table 2). however, the tpad km value for v97e and v97d mutants was
found to be significantly higher than the corresponding aipa
km values. nevertheless, relative to wild-type, the aipa km
values were found to have increased by greater than 100-fold.
as a consequence, the monomeric hhint1 proteins are less efficacious enzymes than the wild-type hhint1 by factors ranging
from 1000 (v97d mutant and aipa) to 2833 (v97e mutant and
tpad) (tables 1 and 2). therefore, the catalytic efficiency of the
mutants with model substrates was substantially reduced. differences were observed for the selectivity of the mutants and
the phosphoramidate or acyl-adenylate substrates. for tpad,
the order of efficiency was wild-type ⬎ v97d mutant ⬎ v97e
mutant. in contrast, the order of efficiency for the more nativelike substrate, aipa, was wild-type ⬎ v97e mutant ⬎ v97d
mutant.
whereas a native phosphoramidate substrate has yet to be
identified, we have shown, recently, that hhint1 is fully capable of catalyzing the hydrolysis of lysyl-adenylate produced
by  xxxg1225xxx  (6). we have demonstrated that this reaction is
dependent on the adenylation of active site residue his112.
formation of an exchangeable and hydrolytically unstable
enzyme-amp intermediate could be readily observed by
treatment of hhint1 with [␣-32p]atp, lysine, and  xxxg1225xxx .
protein labeling was not observed when his112 was replaced
by either glycine or alanine. consequently, we chose to
examine the role of hhint1 dimerization on the hydrolysis of
lysyl-amp generated by  xxxg1225xxx  (fig. 6). consistent with the
aipa kinetic results, the extent of hhint1-amp formation
by wild-type was 2-fold greater than that for the v97e
mutant and 10-fold greater than for v97d mutant. when
pyrophosphatase was added to reduce the level of ppi product inhibition, the discrepancy between the wild-type and
v97e mutant vanished, whereas the amount of v97d mutant
labeling was still found to be less than that for both the wildtype and v97e mutant. the degree to which the kinetic
parameters for the model acyl-amp substrate, aipa, accurately reflect these single time point experiments will require
further investigation. nevertheless, as observed for model
substrate hydrolysis, although hhint1 dimerization is not
required for lysyl-amp hydrolysis, the reaction is dependent
on monomer structure.
to develop a rationale for the difference in the mutant, catalytic efficiency and structure, we carried out a series of molecular dynamic simulations of the v97d and v97e monomers
and compared them to the simulations of both the wild-type
dimer and monomer. although, the overall structure of the
v97e mutant more closely resembled wild-type, significant differences in the final structures of the two monomers were not
observed, particularly with regard to the active site residues.
taken together, these results may indicate that the observed
structural perturbations necessary for the decreased catalytic

monomeric human  xxxg1050xxx 
probably necessary to maintain a tightly associated dimer to
enhance catalytic efficiency through the contributions of the
c-terminal loop of one monomer to the active site of the
other. ongoing steady-state and pre-steady state kinetic
studies to delineate the kinetic and catalytic mechanism of
hhint1 with model substrates and aminoacyl-trna synthetases will allow the contribution of the c termini and
dimerization on substrate binding and active site adenylation and deadenylation to be determined (fig. 8). the identification of v97e as a catalytically functional and largely
structurally unperturbed monomeric version of hhint1
should allow the contribution of dimerization and catalytic
activity on the native function of hhint1 to be characterized.
in principle, with the exception of the galt branch, a similar
approach could be used to investigate the importance of
homodimerization on other members of the hit superfamily, such as  xxxg797xxx , that do not rely on an active site composed
of catalytic residues contributed from each monomer.
