do  xxxd2959xxx  and rocuronium affect human
bronchial smooth muscle?

background: muscle relaxants affect nicotinic and muscarinic
receptors. interaction of muscle relaxants with muscarinic receptors of human airways has been studied incompletely.
methods: the effects of  xxxd2959xxx  bromide (long-acting,
nondepolarizing) and rocuronium bromide (intermediate-acting, nondepolarizing) on prejunctional and postjunctional
muscarinic receptors were studied in 96 isolated human bronchial rings from 12 patients. contractile isometric responses to
electric field stimulation of  xxxd2950xxx stimulated and nonstimulated m2 muscarinic receptors were compared before and
after incubation with the two muscle relaxants. the effect on
postjunctional muscarinic receptors was studied by comparing
acetylcholine concentration–response curves before and after
incubation with the two muscle relaxants.
results:  xxxd2959xxx  bromide, but not rocuronium bromide, inhibited  xxxd2950xxx stimulated prejunctional m2 muscarinic receptors. neither  xxxd2959xxx  bromide nor rocuronium bromide had significant inhibitory effects on
nonstimulated m2 muscarinic receptors and on postjunctional
m3 muscarinic receptors.
conclusions: the inhibitory effect of  xxxd2959xxx  bromide
on  xxxd2950xxx stimulated prejunctional m2 muscarinic receptors occurred at clinical concentrations. (key words: airway
smooth muscle; bronchoconstriction; pilocarpine.)

muscle relaxants affect not only nicotinic receptors of
neuromuscular junctions, but also muscarinic receptors

of airways.1,2 there are several subtypes of muscarinic
receptors in the airways. the m3 muscarinic receptors,
located on the surface of smooth muscle cells, initiate
contraction if stimulated. stimulation of m2 muscarinic
receptors, located on postganglionic nerve endings of
cholinergic nerves, inhibits acetylcholine release.3 m2
muscarinic receptors, located on the surface of smooth
muscle cells, have several functions, including inhibition
of adenylyl cyclase activity and relaxation in response to
b2-adrenoceptor stimulation4 and inhibition of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels, thus
contributing to contractile responses to metacholine.5
interaction of muscle relaxants with muscarinic receptors of airways has been studied in anesthetized dogs1
and guinea pigs,2 but to our knowledge only the effect of
 xxxd2174xxx  has been studied in isolated human bronchial
rings.6 because the distribution and relative abundance
of receptors may vary between species,7,8 the results of
studies in animals cannot be extrapolated to human
airways. therefore, we decided to study the effect of
two new muscle relaxants, the long-acting muscle relaxant  xxxd2959xxx  bromide and the intermediate-acting
agent rocuronium bromide (henceforth referred to as
 xxxd2959xxx  and rocuronium, respectively) on muscarinic receptors in human isolated bronchial rings.

materials and methods
bronchi were obtained from 12 patients (aged 40 –77
yr) who underwent operation for removal of lung cancer. all patients received general anesthesia for the surgical procedure (the choice of anesthetic drugs was
made by attending anesthesiologists). surgical specimens, remote from the cancerous lesions, were obtained
from the surgical waste after tissue had been removed
for microscopic examination. the specimens were immersed in chilled, aerated (95% o2 and 5% co2) physiologic salt solution (pss) of the following composition:
nacl, 110.5 mm; kcl, 3.4 mm; cacl2, 2.4 mm;  xxxd2534xxx , 0.8
mm; kh2po4, 1.2 mm; nahco3, 25.7 mm; and dextrose,
5.6 mm. they were transported to the laboratory and

stored overnight in aerated pss at 4°c. eight bronchial
rings (2– 4 mm id) were used from each patient.
procedure
the bronchi were dissected from surrounding tissue
without damaging the epithelium9 and cut into rings of
4 to 5 mm. the rings were suspended between stirrups
in 25-ml water-jacketed tissue baths containing aerated
pss with propranolol 1026 m at 37°c. the lower stirrup
was connected via a silk string to a stationary hook in
the tissue bath; the upper stirrup was connected via a
silk string to a force transducer (model ft 03 d; grass
medical instruments, quincy, ma) mounted on a micromanipulator. two platinum electrodes (1 3 4 cm) were
placed on each side of the rings. the rings were stimulated by electric field stimulation (efs). efs was provided by a direct-current amplifier (mayo clinic, section
of engineering, rochester, mn) triggered by an electric
stimulator (model s 44; grass medical instruments). isometric forces were recorded continuously (ta 4000;
gould, valley view, oh). the rings were stretched to a
resting force of 1 6 0.4 g, which corresponds to optimal
length in human bronchi of this size.9 the lengths of the
rings were not changed during the study.
effects of  xxxd2959xxx  and rocuronium on
postjunctional muscarinic receptors
 xxxd2959xxx  and rocuronium were gifts from organon technika (turnhout, belgium). four rings from
each of the 12 patients (48 rings total) were incubated
with 1026 m tetrodotoxin for 30 min to block the effect
of prejunctional stimulation of muscarinic receptors by
acetylcholine. acetylcholine concentration–response
curves were then obtained by cumulatively increasing
the concentration of acetylcholine from 1029 to 1022 m
in half-log increments. after the acetylcholine concentration–response curves were completed, the rings were
washed with pss until the resting forces were reestablished. the rings were then reincubated with 1026 m
tetrodotoxin for 30 min. three rings from each of 6 of 12
patients (18 rings total) were incubated for 30 min with
 xxxd2959xxx  1027 m (n 5 6), 1026 m (n 5 6), or 1025
m (n 5 6). the remaining rings from each patient (six
rings each) were not incubated with  xxxd2959xxx  and
served as controls. complete sets of acetylcholine concentration–response curves were again obtained. the
same procedure was used in 24 rings from the other six
patients to study the effect of 1027 m (n 5 6), 1026 m
(n 5 6), and 1025 m (n 5 6) rocuronium.

effects of  xxxd2959xxx  and rocuronium on
nonstimulated m2 muscarinic receptors
four other rings from each of the 12 patients (48 rings
total) were stimulated for 30 s at 3-min intervals by efs
(25 hz, 25 v, 0.5 ms) until three reproducible contractions were observed. three rings from each of 6 of the
12 patients (18 rings total) were then incubated for 30
min with  xxxd2959xxx  1027 m (n 5 6), 1026 m (n 5 6),
or 1025 m (n 5 6), and efs was repeated. one ring from
each patient (six rings total) was not incubated with
 xxxd2959xxx  and served as control. the same protocol
was used in the 24 rings from the other six patients to
study the effects of rocuronium, 1027 m (n 5 6), 1026 m
(n 5 6), and 1025 m (n 5 6).
effects of  xxxd2959xxx  or rocuronium on
 xxxd2950xxx stimulated m2 muscarinic receptors
following the same procedure, the same 48 rings were
incubated for 3 min with 1029 m pilocarpine, to stimulate m2 muscarinic receptors. efs (25 hz, 25v, 0.5 ms),
30 s in duration, was then applied at 3-min intervals until
the contractions became steady. the pilocarpine concentrations in the tissue bath were cumulatively increased in half-log increments up to a concentration of
1024 m after contractile responses to efs became constant. after the study, all rings were blotted dry and
weighed.
data analysis
active contractile forces (total contractile force minus
resting force) in response to efs or acetylcholine were
corrected for the effect of time by assuming the effect of
time in control rings to be equal to that in rings incubated with muscle relaxants.7 mean weights, maximal
forces, and resting forces were compared by unpaired t
tests. contractile responses of nonstimulated m2 muscarinic receptors before and after incubation with  xxxd2959xxx  or rocuronium were compared by paired t tests.
two-factor repeated-measure analysis of variance with
the newman–keuls post hoc test was used for statistical
analysis of the pilocarpine concentration–response
curves and concentrations necessary for 50% inhibition
of contraction (ic50).
data were considered to be significantly different if
p , 0.05. all data are reported as the mean 6 sd.
drugs
pilocarpine hydrochloride,  xxxd3033xxx , acetylcholine chloride, and tetrodotoxin were purchased from sigma (milan, italy). all drugs were dis-

were prepared daily.

results
resting forces of the rings in which the effect of
 xxxd2959xxx  was studied were not significantly different from rings in which rocuronium was studied (p 5
0.09). the maximal forces were significantly different
between the two groups (p , 0.03), but the difference
in mean ring weights did not achieve statistical significance (p 5 0.33).
effects of  xxxd2959xxx  and rocuronium on
postjunctional muscarinic receptors
 xxxd2959xxx  (1027–1025 m) and rocuronium (1027–
1025 m) had no significant effects on acetylcholine concentration–response curves (p . 0.07). data for  xxxd2959xxx  are shown in figure 1.
effects of  xxxd2959xxx  and rocuronium on
nonstimulated m2 muscarinic receptors
 xxxd2959xxx  (1027 to 1025 m) and rocuronium (1027
to 1025 m) had no significant effects on contractile responses to efs (table 1).

pilocarpine reduced significantly contractile responses
to efs in a concentration-dependent manner (p ,

0.0001) (fig. 2). contractile responses to efs were increased significantly after incubation with 1027 m  xxxd2959xxx  at pilocarpine concentrations of 3 3 1026 and
1025 m (p , 0.05), with 1026 m  xxxd2959xxx  at 1027 to
3 3 1026 m pilocarpine (p , 0.03), and with 1025 m
 xxxd2959xxx  at 1027 m to 3 3 1025 m pilocarpine
concentrations (p , 0.01). the ic50s of the pilocarpine
concentration–response curves were significantly reduced by  xxxd2959xxx  1026 and 1025 m (p 5 0.02 and
p 5 0.0004, respectively), but not with 1027 m  xxxd2959xxx  (p 5 0.46). conversely, rocuronium (1027 to
1025 m) had no significant effect (p . 0.05) on the
contractile responses to efs at any pilocarpine concentration and did not significantly (p . 0.15) reduce the
ic50 (table 2).
no significant (p . 0.14) differences in increases in
resting forces between control rings and rings incubated
with  xxxd2959xxx  1027 or 1026 m occurred (fig. 3).
however, with 1025 m  xxxd2959xxx , increases in resting forces were significantly smaller than those in control rings at pilocarpine concentrations larger than 3 3
1027 m (p , 0.002).

discussion
the two important findings of this study are that  xxxd2959xxx  had an inhibitory effect on  xxxd2950xxx stimulated prejunctional m2 muscarinic receptors, but no effect on nonstimulated prejunctional m2- or on
postjunctional m3 muscarinic receptors. rocuronium
had neither pre- nor postjunctional inhibitory effects on
muscarinic receptors.
limitations
one must be careful in extrapolating these results
obtained in isolated human bronchi to humans in vivo.
first, only bronchi with internal diameters of 2– 4 mm
were studied. the diameters of the studied bronchi may
be important because relative abundance of receptors
may vary among airway generations.7,8 second, in intact
subjects, the response of airways to muscle relaxants
may be modulated by circulating hormones and humoral
substances carried in the blood. this may be of particular importance in those muscle relaxants releasing histamine from mast cells. furthermore, the response of airway smooth muscles may be altered by stimuli from the
central nervous system.
stimulation of muscarinic receptors in airways may
result in synthesis and release of prostaglandins,10 which

in turn inhibit release of acetylcholine from postganglionic prejunctional cholinergic fibers, thus reducing contractile response to efs.11 to inhibit the reduction in
contractile response, synthesis and release of prostaglandins can be experimentally antagonized by incubation
with indomethacin.7,12 but indomethacin can inhibit
prejunctional m2 muscarinic receptor function in guinea
pigs13; therefore, we decided not to incubate the bronchial rings with indomethacin.
low concentrations of pilocarpine selectively stimulate prejunctional m2 muscarinic receptors,6,9 with no
change in resting force. at higher concentrations
postjunctional muscarinic m2- and m3 muscarinic receptors also are stimulated,6,9 resulting in an increase in
resting force. efs stimulates not only cholinergic nerves,

but also excitatory and inhibitory nonadrenergic noncholinergic (i-nanc) nerves. human airways have few
excitatory nonadrenergic noncholinergic nerves,14 making it unlikely that  xxxd2959xxx  enhanced contractile
responses by stimulation of excitatory nonadrenergic
noncholinergic nerves. but human airways have i-nanc
nerves.15 inhibition of i-nanc nerves by  xxxd2959xxx 
could contribute to the increased contractile responses
to efs. to exclude this possibility, we determined in
eight bronchial rings from two additional patients the
effect of 1027 to 1025 m  xxxd2959xxx  on i-nanc nerve
stimulation and found no consistent effect, suggesting
that inhibition of i-nanc nerves by  xxxd2959xxx  did
not contribute to the increased contractile responses to
efs.
all patients received a general anesthetic. to remove
the anesthetic drugs from the tissue, all bronchi were
stored overnight in 100 ml aerated pss, and they were
washed repeatedly for 2 h with pss on the day of the
study before measurements were begun. one cannot
exclude the possibility that the drugs were not washed
out completely.

postjunctional muscarinic receptors
 xxxd2959xxx , 1027 to 1025 m, and rocuronium, 1027

rings incubated with 1025 m  xxxd2959xxx  than in control rings

effects of  xxxd2959xxx  and rocuronium on
nonstimulated m2 muscarinic receptors
no consistent or convincing evidence for functional
prejunctional m2 muscarinic receptors in human airways
using nonstimulated m2 muscarinic receptors has been
published.6,8,17 we also did not find consistent or significant increases in contractile responses to efs in bronchial rings incubated with  xxxd2959xxx .
however, functional prejunctional m2 muscarinic receptors have been shown in human isolated bronchi
using  xxxd2950xxx stimulated m2 muscarinic receptors.6,9
more recently, measurement of acetylcholine release in
response to vagus nerve stimulation before and after
incubation with m2 muscarinic antagonists3 has provided more direct evidence for functioning prejunctional m2 muscarinic receptors in human airways.

neuronal conduction, only postjunctional effects of acetylcholine could contribute to the contractile response.
the unchanged acetylcholine concentration–response
curves therefore suggest that  xxxd2959xxx  and rocuronium did not inhibit postjunctional muscarinic receptors. in canine isolated trachealis muscle, the specific m3
antagonist 4-diphenylacetoxy-n-methylpiperidine (4damp) methiode attenuates the response to acetylcholine, suggesting that postjunctional m3 muscarinic receptors primarily mediate the contractile response to
acetylcholine.16 also, the characteristics of the antagonist effect of (pa2) 4-damp methiode on acetylcholine is
consistent with m3 receptors mediating contractile responses to acetylcholine.16 by contrast  xxxd2174xxx , a specific m2-receptor agonist, does not alter the contractile
response to acetylcholine in canine isolated trachealis
muscle,16 suggesting that postjunctional m3- and not m2
muscarinic receptors mediate contractile responses to
acetylcholine. assuming human airways respond similarly, the data of this study suggest that  xxxd2959xxx 
and rocuronium had no effect on postjunctional m3
muscarinic receptors.
but postjunctional m2 muscarinic receptors can also
contribute to contractile responses.4 if pilocarpine stimulated postjunctional m2 muscarinic receptors, inhibition of postjunctional m2 muscarinic receptors by  xxxd2959xxx  should reduce the resting force in response to
pilocarpine. the increase in resting forces with pilocarpine was significantly less after incubation with 1025

effects of  xxxd2959xxx  and rocuronium on
 xxxd2950xxx stimulated m2 muscarinic receptors
low concentrations of pilocarpine (1029 to 3 3 1027
m) selectively stimulated m2 muscarinic receptors. contractile responses to efs were increased by  xxxd2959xxx  1026 and 1025 m at low concentrations of pilocarpine, suggesting that  xxxd2959xxx  inhibited
prejunctional m2 muscarinic receptors. inhibition of
prejunctional m2-receptors has also been shown with
 xxxd2174xxx  in isolated human bronchi.6 rocuronium did
not increase contractile responses to efs at the three
tested concentrations, suggesting that it had no inhibitory effects on prejunctional m2 muscarinic receptors.
the conclusion of an inhibitory effect of  xxxd2959xxx  on prejunctional m2 muscarinic receptors agrees
with observations by okanlami et al.2 in intact guinea
pigs. these authors, however, suggested that the m2inhibitory effect occurred at doses larger than used clinically. however, plasma concentrations of  xxxd2959xxx 
as high as 1.3 3 1026 m occur in humans after bolus
injections of 0.07 mg/kg,18 suggesting that  xxxd2959xxx  may exert inhibitory effects on prejunctional m2
muscarinic receptors during clinical practice.
in an elegant recent study, hou et al.19 determined the
binding affinities of muscle relaxants in cells with either
pure m2- or  xxxg449xxx  populations. these
authors found a higher binding affinity for rocuronium
(ic50 5 3.0 mm) than for  xxxd2959xxx  (ic50 5 5.8 mm)
for m2 muscarinic receptors. these results appear to be

inconsistent with the results of the current study, which
found no effect of rocuronium on m2 muscarinic receptors. however, in the study by hou et al.19 no statistical
analyses for the binding affinities were included, and
differences in binding affinities between  xxxd2959xxx 
and rocuronium were small compared with differences
between pancuronium and  xxxd2959xxx  or pancuronium and rocuronium.
