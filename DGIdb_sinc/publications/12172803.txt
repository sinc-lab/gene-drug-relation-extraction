abstract cloning of genes encoding polyketide synthases (pkss) has allowed us to identify a gene cluster for
ml-236b biosynthesis in penicillium citrinum. like
lovastatin, which is produced by aspergillus terreus,
ml-236b (compactin) inhibits the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl- xxxd1739xxx  (hmg-coa) reductase.
genomic sequencing and northern analysis showed that
nine predicted genes for ml-236b biosynthesis were
located within a 38-kb region and were transcribed when
ml-236b was produced. the predicted amino acid sequences encoded by these nine genes, designated mlca–
mlch and mlcr, were similar to those encoded by the
genes for lovastatin synthesis, and were therefore assumed to be involved either directly or indirectly in ml236b biosynthesis. targeted disruption experiments
provided evidence that two pks genes in the cluster,
mlca and mlcb, are required for the biosynthesis of the
nonaketide and the diketide moieties, respectively, of
ml-236b, suggesting that the gene cluster as a whole is
responsible for ml-236b biosynthesis in p. citrinum.
bioconversion of some of the predicted intermediates by
an mlca-disrupted mutant was also investigated in order
to analyze the ml-236b biosynthetic pathway. the
molecular organization of the gene cluster and proposed
functions for the ml-236b biosynthetic genes in
p. citrinum are described.

introduction
ml-236b (compactin), a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy3-methylglutaryl- xxxd1739xxx  (hmg-coa) reductase, is
produced by penicillium citrinum and used as a substrate
for microbial conversion to pravastatin sodium (brown
et al. 1976; endo et al. 1976; serizawa et al. 1983).
pravastatin sodium has been widely used as a pharmaceutical drug in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.
ml-236b and related compounds are produced via a
polyketide pathway (endo et al. 1985; moore et al. 1985;
wagschal et al. 1996). polyketides are a large group of
structurally diverse secondary metabolites produced by
bacteria, fungi and plants. key enzymes required for
polyketide biosynthesis are deﬁned as polyketide synthases (pkss) (hopwood and sherman 1990). fungal
pkss, in particular, are deﬁned as iterative type i pkss,
in contrast to the modular type i pkss and monofunctional type ii pkss found in bacteria. fungal pkss are
classiﬁed into three groups: (1) single aromatic ring
pkss; (2) polycyclic aromatic ring pkss; and (3) reduced complex-type pkss (hutchinson and fujii 1995;
fujii et al. 1998). ml-236b is thought to be a fully
reduced compound derived from acetyl-coa and
malonyl-coa, so the expected pks system for ml-236b
biosynthesis should belong to the third group.
several genes encoding pkss have already been
cloned and characterized from fungi (beck et al. 1990;
mayorga and timberlake 1990; chang et al. 1995; feng
and leonard 1995; takano et al. 1995; yang et al. 1996).
recently, a gene cluster for the biosynthesis of lovastatin, another natural  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitor
produced by aspergillus terreus, has been characterized
(alberts et al. 1980; hendrickson et al. 1999; kennedy
et al. 1999). the structure of lovastatin diﬀers from that
of ml-236b, in that a methyl group derived from
s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx  (sam) is introduced at the

637

c-6 position of the nonaketide-derived skeleton (moore
et al. 1985; wagschal et al. 1996). in the lovastatin
biosynthetic gene cluster, two genes for iterative type i
pkss – lovastatin nonaketide synthase (lnks) and
lovastatin diketide synthase (ldks) – were found.
lnks and ldks are required to synthesize the nonaketide backbone and the (2r)-2-methylbutyryl side
chain of lovastatin, respectively (hendrickson et al.
1999; kennedy et al. 1999). each pks has a methyltransferase (mt) domain, which is thought to add a
methyl group derived from sam to the polyketide chain
(hendrickson et al. 1999; kennedy et al. 1999).
the functions of some of the other genes required
for lovastatin biosynthesis have also been reported
(kennedy et al. 1999).
identiﬁcation and characterization of the ml-236b
biosynthetic genes are required in order to clarify the
biosynthetic pathway in p. citrinum and facilitate the use
of recombinant dna techniques to improve ml-236b
productivity.
in the present study, we identiﬁed a gene cluster for
ml-236b biosynthesis in p. citrinum, comprising nine
genes which were designated mlca–mlch and mlcr.
functional inactivation analysis provided evidence for
the direct involvement of two genes, mlca and mlcb, in
ml-236b biosynthesis. we also examined the ml-236b
biosynthetic pathway using an mlca disruption mutant.
high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) and
combined liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry
(lc/ms) analyses showed that ml-236a and ml236c, which had been isolated from cultures of p. citrinum (endo et al. 1976), were converted to ml-236b by
the mlca-disruptant. this is the ﬁrst report which examines the structure and function of the biosynthetic
genes involved in ml-236b biosynthesis.

materials and methods

(roche). all other nucleic acid manipulations were performed by
standard methods (sambrook et al. 1989).
cloning of pks genes
several sets of degenerate pcr primers were used to amplify pks
genes from p. citrinum. the primer pair used to clone one of the
pks genes, designated pks4, involved in ml-236b biosynthesis
consisted of the 5¢ sense primer 5¢-gayacigcitgyasttc-3¢
(17 bp) and the 3¢ antisense primer 5¢-tciccikircwgtgicc-3¢
(17 bp). genomic dna extracted from p. citrinum was used as the
template. pcr fragments were subcloned into the pcr2.1 vector
(invitrogen) and subjected to sequence analysis.
construction of the cosmid vector psakcos1
a shuttle cosmid vector was designated for construction of the
p. citrinum genomic library. pdf333 (nara et al. 1993) and the
cosmid pwe15 (stratagene) were used for the construction of
psakcos1. pdf333 was digested with bamhi, blunted with t4
dna polymerase, religated and transformed into e. coli jm109.
the resulting plasmid was named psak401. to prepare the
lambda cos sequence from pwe15, the 2.3-kb scai-sali fragment
was recovered from an agarose gel after electrophoresis, blunted
with t4 dna polymerase and inserted into the pvuii site of
psak401. the resulting cosmid vector was named psakcos1.
construction and screening of the p. citrinum genomic
dna library
psakcos1 was digested with bamhi and dephosphorylated with
bacterial alkaline phosphatase. p. citrinum genomic dna was
partially digested with sau3ai to generate 35- to 45-kb fragments
and was size-fractionated on an agarose gel. dna fragments puriﬁed from the gel were ligated to the bamhi site of psakcos1.
the ligated dna was packaged in vitro using gigapack ii gold
extracts (stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
e. coli xl-1 blue mr cells were transfected with the packaging
solution containing lambda phage particles by standard methods
(sambrook et al. 1989). the p. citrinum cosmid dna library was
subsequently screened using the dig-labeled pcr fragment. a
number of positive cosmids were identiﬁed and subjected to
sequence analysis.

fungal strains and culture conditions

genomic sequencing

p. citrinum no. 41520, which is an ml-236b high-producing mutant derived from p. citrinum ferm bp-4129 following several
rounds of chemical mutagenesis and re-isolation (hosobuchi et al.
1993), was used in this study. to obtain conidia, spores were incubated on pga plates at 26c for 10 days. ypl-20 liquid medium
and vgs plates were used for fungal transformation as described
previously (nara et al. 1993). mbg3-8 liquid medium was used for
nucleic acid isolation and ml-236b production (hosobuchi et al.
1993). about 107 spores were transferred to a 100-ml ﬂask containing 10 ml of mbg3-8 medium and incubated for 3–12 days.
escherichia coli xl-1 blue mr (stratagene) was used as a host
strain for the construction of a cosmid dna library. e. coli jm109
(takara shuzo) was used for the construction, propagation and
ampliﬁcation of plasmids.

more than 80 restriction endonuclease fragments derived from the
three cosmids pml45, pml48 and pml51 were inserted into
puc119. deletion series were constructed using a deletion kit for
kilo-sequencing (takara). cycle sequencing reactions were carried
out using the bigdye terminator/primer cycle sequencing reaction kit and dna sequencing was carried out with a abi prism 377
sequencer (applied biosystems). dozens of synthetic primers
(takara) were used to complete the sequence analysis. primary
sequence data were analyzed using dnasis software (hitachi
software engineering). putative orfs were found with the aid of
blast 2.0 searches (altschul et al. 1997). the nucleotide sequence
of the gene cluster in p. citrinum, spanning a 38-kb region, has been
deposited in the ddbj database under the accession no.
ab072893. the complete sequence of the approximately 60-kb
region will be made public in the near future.

nucleic acid manipulations
cdna sequencing
fungal chromosomal dna was isolated according to the method
developed by yelton et al. (1984). total rna of p. citrinum was
extracted and isolated with the rneasy total plant kit (qiagen)
according to the supplier’s instructions. southern hybridizations
and northern hybridizations were performed using the dig system

cdna sequencing of nine genes, designated mlca–mlch and mlcr,
was carried out to characterize their structures. first-strand cdna
was synthesized with the la pcr kit ver. 1.1 (takara) and used
as the template for pcr. ampliﬁcation of full-length or partial

638
cdnas was carried out with several sets of oligonucleotide primers. reaction conditions used to amplify cdnas were: 94c for
30 s, 62c for 30 s, and 72c for 5 min, for 30 cycles. determination of the 5¢ end sequences was carried out with the 5¢race
system for rapid ampliﬁcation of the cdna ends, ver. 2.0
(gibco brl), and the 3¢ end sequences were identiﬁed using the
ready-to-go t-primed first-strand kit (amersham pharmacia
biotech) according to the instruction manual provided.
construction of targeted disruption vectors
targeted disruption vectors for the generation of gene disruptants
were constructed using the fungal transforming vector pdf333. a
4.1-kb internal kpni fragment of the mlca locus and a 1.4-kb pstibamhi fragment of the mlcb locus were puriﬁed, truncated with a
dna blunting kit (takara) and ligated to pvuii-digested pdf333.
the resulting disruption vectors were designated pdismlca and
pdismlcb.
transformation of p. citrinum
protoplast preparation and dna transformation were performed
as described previously (nara et al. 1993). in short, samples (0.5 g)
of germinating conidia were treated with an enzyme solution containing chitinase (sigma) and zymolyase 20-t (seikagaku). after
incubating at 30c for 0.5–1 h, protoplasts were ﬁltered through a
sterile glass ﬁlter (3g-2), and washed in 550 mm mgcl2. transformations were done in a solution containing 20% (w/v)
peg8000, 50 mm cacl2, 10 mm mops and 10 mm edta
(ph 8.0). a 120-lg aliquot of each disruption vector was used for
transformation. hygromycin b-resistant transformants were selected on agar plates containing 200 lg/ml hygromycin b after
incubation at 26c for 14 days.
measurement of ml-236b and related compounds
in culture broth
ml-236b and related compounds were analyzed as follows. the
fermentation broth was diluted sixfold with 0.2 n naoh. after
shaking for 1 h on a rotary shaker, the alkaline broth was diluted
tenfold with 50% methanol. after centrifugation, the supernatant
was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc)
for ml-236b sodium and its intermediates [the mobile phase consisted of 75% methanol, 0.1% acetic acid, 0.1% triethylamine, 24.8%
water; the ssc-ods-262 column (sensyu chemicals) was used at a
ﬂow rate of 1–2 ml/min, and eluted compounds were detected at
236 nm]. liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (lc/ms) was
used to conﬁrm the hplc analysis. samples were injected into a c-18
reverse-phase hplc column coupled to a micromass quattro-ii
triple quadrapole electrospray mass spectrometer. peaks from the
hplc were analyzed by mass spectrometry and molecular weights
were determined. the mobile phase for lc consisted of 10%–90%
mecn/5 mm ch3cooh–h2o, and the shiseido capcell pack
ug120 column (2·150 mm) was used at a ﬂow rate of 0.2 ml/min.

results
pcr cloning of pks genes from p. citrinum
to clone the pks genes required for ml-236b biosynthesis in p. citrinum, degenerate pcr primers were designed from the most conserved regions found in many
pkss and fatty acid synthases (fass) (beck et al. 1990;
1992; mayorga and timberlake 1990; chang et al. 1995;
feng and leonard 1995; takano et al. 1995; yang et al.
1996). the forward 17mer primers were based on the

conserved amino acid sequence dtacss, which corresponds to the active site of the b-ketoacyl-acp synthase
(ks) domain. the reverse 17mer primers were designed
from the consensus motif ghsxge, which corresponds
to the active site of the acyltransferase (at) domain.
three pairs of degenerate primers were used in pcrs to
amplify the corresponding fragments from the p. citrinum genome. the fragments obtained (1–2 kb long)
were extracted from the agarose gel and subcloned into
the ta cloning vector pcr2.1 (invitrogen). four different pks genes were identiﬁed in the cloned pcr
fragments and each was found to contain the conserved
motifs of both the ks and at domains. they were
temporarily named pks1–pks4 (data not shown).
to determine whether each pks gene is transcribed
during cultivation for ml-236b production in p. citrinum, northern hybridizations were carried out using the
dig-labeled pcr fragments as dna probes. the results
suggested that the expression proﬁle of one of the four
pks genes, pks4, appeared to be correlated with the
pattern of ml-236b production (data not shown). subsequently, the p. citrinum cosmid library was screened
and a set of cosmids including the pks4 gene was obtained.
identiﬁcation of an ml-236b biosynthetic
gene cluster
three overlapping cosmids, designated pml45, pml48
and pml51, were sequenced and the complete sequence
of a 60-kb region was determined (fig. 1). database
searches provided information on the putative gene loci,
and at least eighteen orfs were located within the region (data not shown). in particular, nine of these
eighteen genes were revealed to have strong similarity to
the genes in the recently reported lovastatin biosynthetic
gene cluster (kennedy et al. 1999), and therefore these
genes were presumed to encode polypeptides required
for ml-236b biosynthesis. to simplify the nomenclature, the predicted ml-236b biosynthetic genes were
designated mlca–mlch and mlcr (fig. 1a); the pks4
gene corresponds to mlca.
in order to examine the transcription of the predicted
ml-236b biosynthetic genes, northern hybridizations
were carried out with dig-labeled dna fragments
from pml45 and pml48. transcripts of most of the
putative ml-236b biosynthetic genes were not detected
on the second day of cultivation (exponential growth
phase), but they were detected on the third day, at the
beginning of the stationary phase, which was consistent
with the timing of ml-236b production.
characterization of the predicted ml-236b
biosynthetic genes
identiﬁcation of transcript endpoints by the race
method and cdna sequencing veriﬁed the existence of
the nine predicted genes, and the deduced polypeptide

cultivation was blotted in lanes 1 and 2, respectively. the blots are

known sizes (not shown). e, ecori; b, bamhi

sequences were conﬁrmed (data not shown). characterization and the proposed functions of the ml-236b
biosynthetic genes are described below and summarized
in table 1.
polyketide synthesis
two genes, mlca and mlcb, encode putative novel
multifunctional type i pkss with deduced lengths of
3032 amino acids (334 kda) and 2563 amino acids
(280 kda), respectively. a comparison between the genomic dna and cdna sequences revealed that mlca
and mlcb contained ten and six introns, respectively.
mlca and mlcb show strong similarity to other pkss

and share 59% and 61% identity with lnks (lovb)
(hendrickson et al. 1999; kennedy et al. 1999) and
ldks (lovf) (kennedy et al. 1999), respectively, both
involved in lovastatin synthesis. several motifs could be
recognized in mlca and mlcb by comparing their amino
acid sequences with those of known pkss and fass.
the positions of the active domains in mlca and mlcb
are shown in fig. 2a. the conserved active domains
such as b-ketoacyl-acp synthase (ks), acyltransferase
(at), dehydratase (dh), b-ketoacyl-acp reductase
(kr), and acyl-carrier protein (acp) domains were
identiﬁed in both mlca and mlcb. a peptide synthetase
elongation domain (psed) was only identiﬁed in mlca
and an enoyl reductase (er) domain was only identiﬁed
in mlcb (data not shown). the methyltransferase (mt)
domains found in lnks and ldks were also identiﬁed
in mlca and mlcb, but the mt domain in mlca is
thought to be inactive (fig. 2b).

(motifs i–iii) found in most methyltransferases as indicated by the

formation and post-polyketide modiﬁcation. mlcc contains two introns and encodes a putative p450 monooxygenase of 518 amino acids (59.4 kda). mlcc has a
putative heme-binding motif reported in cytochrome
p450 monooxygenases and shares 72% identity with
lova (kennedy et al. 1999), which is predicted to be
required for the lovastatin biosynthesis. mlcf encodes a
putative oxidoreductase of 251 amino acids (27.9 kda).
mlcf shows some similarity to dihydrofolate reductases
and also shares 57% identity with a putative polypeptide
encoded by orf5 in the lovastatin gene cluster. mlcg
contains two introns and encodes a putative oxidoreductase of 362 amino acids (39.6 kda). mlcg shows
70% identity to lovc, which has an enoyl reductase
activity required for lovastatin biosynthesis (kennedy
et al. 1999). mlch contains three introns and encodes a
putative transesterase of 418 amino acids (46.7 kda).
mlch displays 75% identity with lovd (hendrickson
et al. 1999; kennedy et al. 1999), a transesterase required
for lovastatin biosynthesis.

resistance and secretion
two genes, mlcd and mlce, encode putative polypeptides that may be involved in conferring resistance to
ml-236b and in metabolite secretion. mlcd contains two
introns and encodes a putative  xxxg1060xxx  of
1173 amino acids (126 kda). mlcd has the characteristic
eight transmembrane-spanning domains in the n-terminal region, predicted by the kyte-doolittle method, and
the conserved catalytic domains in the c-terminal segment, like other hmg-coa reductases (data not shown)
(liscum et al. 1985; basson et al. 1986, 1988; choi et al.
1992; burmester and czempinski 1994; lum et al. 1996).
mlcd is 63% identical to a putative polypeptide encoded
by orf8 in the lovastatin gene cluster from a. terreus
(kennedy et al. 1999). mlce contains seven introns and
encodes a putative integral transmembrane eﬄux pump
of 553 amino acids (58.7 kda). mlce shows similarity to
toxa from cochliobolus carbonum (pitkin et al. 1996)
and to some of the drug resistance proteins in the major
facilitator superfamily (ahmed et al. 1995). mlce shares
70% identity with a putative polypeptide encoded by
orf10 in the lovastatin gene cluster.

regulation
the gene mlcr encodes a putative polypeptide that
could be involved in the regulation of ml-236b biosynthesis. mlcr contains two introns and codes for a
putative transcription factor of 459 amino acids
(50.4 kda). mlcr has a gal4-type zinc-ﬁnger cluster
motif (laughon and gesteland 1984; burger et al. 1991;
vallee et al. 1991; payne et al. 1993; woloshuk et al.
1994, 1995), zn(ii)2cys6, in the n-terminal region of the

641

polypeptide and exhibits 34% identity with love
(kennedy et al. 1999), a putative transcription factor
required for lovastatin biosynthesis.
functional analysis of the polyketide synthase
genes mlca and mlcb
targeted disruption experiments were carried out to
conﬁrm that the predicted ml-236b biosynthetic genes
are involved in ml-236b biosynthesis of p. citrinum. in
the present study, two pks genes, mlca and mlcb, were
chosen for functional analysis.
a blunt-ended 4.1-kb kpni fragment of the mlca
locus was ligated into the pvuii site of pdf333 to yield
the disruption vector pdismlca. fungal transformation
resulted in the recovery of 27 transformants; 21 of these
did not produce ml-236b nor its intermediates at all.
southern analysis of some of the non-ml-236b-producing transformants, referred to as the mlca series,
indicated that pdismlca had integrated homologously
into the mlca locus and the results of southern analysis
were consistent with the tandem insertion of plasmid
copies, as depicted in fig. 3.
to disrupt the mlcb gene, an internal 1.4-kb pstibamhi fragment of the mlcb locus was blunt-ended and
ligated into the pvuii site of pdf333 to form pdismlcb,
which was subsequently transformed into the parent
strain. one transformant, designated mlcb, produced a
large amount of ml-236a, a predicted precursor of
fig. 3a, b. disruption of mlca. a the predicted disruption event.
the deduced restriction patterns of the genomic dna of the parent
strain (above) and mlca mutants (below) are shown. an internal
4.1-kb kpni fragment of the mlca locus was used for the
construction of pdismlca and as a dig-labeled hybridization
probe. the sites that hybridized with the probe are shown as black
bars. b genomic southern hybridizations. the hybridization
patterns obtained after digestion of genomic dna from the parent
strain and four of the mlca-disrupted mutants (mlca-t1 to -t4)
with the indicated enzymes are shown. homologous integration of
tandem repeats results in new bands as shown in a, the 19.6-, 9.4and 9-kb sspi fragments and the 23-kb kpni fragments found in
the genomic dna from these four transformants. in mlca-t1 and t3, integration occurred only by homologous recombination, but
in mlca-t2 and -t4, additional integrations also occurred
elsewhere. p, parent

ml-236b, but did not produce ml-236b at all. southern analysis conﬁrmed that a targeted disruption had
occurred at the mlcb locus in the same way as in the
mlca disruption mutant (fig. 4).
these data suggest that mlca and mlcb in the cluster
are involved in the biosynthesis of the nonaketide and
diketide backbones of ml-236b, respectively. functional analysis of the other predicted biosynthetic genes
will be discussed elsewhere.

bioconversion of predicted intermediates
by an mlca-disrupted mutant
figure 5 shows the proposed pathway for ml-236b
biosynthesis, which is considered to be very similar to
that for lovastatin biosynthesis (kennedy et al. 1999;
hutchinson et al. 2000; sutherland et al. 2001). to
conﬁrm that some of the proposed biosynthetic steps
exist in p. citrinum, conversion analysis of the predicted
intermediates was conducted using an mlca-disrupted
mutant, mlca-t1. two of the predicted intermediates,
ml-236c and ml-236a, were added separately on the
third day of cultivation. as shown in fig. 6, almost all
the ml-236c, added up to a ﬁnal concentration of
2 mg/ml, was converted rapidly to ml-236a and ml236b within 24 h after addition. ml-236a, added at the
same concentration, was converted more slowly, but
most of ml-236a was converted into ml-236b within
72 h. these data suggest that ml-236c and ml-236a
can be converted into ml-236b via the pathway steps
that remain active in the mlca-t1 mutant.

discussion
we have cloned and characterized the gene cluster for
ml-236b biosynthesis in p. citrinum no. 41520. database searches using the sequence of an approximately
60-kb segment of the p. citrinum genome, and northern
analysis, indicated that at least eighteen genes were located within the region (data not shown). in particular,
nine of these eighteen genes showed signiﬁcant homology to genes identiﬁed in the lovastatin biosynthesis gene

polypeptides required for ml-236b biosynthesis
(table 1).
the proposed pathway for ml-236b biosynthesis is
shown in fig. 5, and is very similar to that for lovastatin
biosynthesis (wagschal et al. 1996; kennedy et al. 1999;
hutchinson et al. 2000; sutherland et al. 2001). some of
the metabolites, 4a,5-dihydrocompactin (hereafter referred to as 4a,5-dihydro ml-236c), ml-236c, ml236a and ml-236b, have been isolated from cultures of
p. citrinum (endo et al. 1976; lam et al. 1981; wagschal
et al. 1996). 3a-hydroxy-3,5-dihydro ml-236c, previously isolated from paecilomyces viridis (murakawa
et al. 1994), was also detected in the culture broth of
p. citrinum (our unpublished data). in the present study,
some of the proposed biosynthetic steps were conﬁrmed
by gene disruption, analysis of disrupted mutants for
metabolite accumulation and bioconversion of the predicted intermediates in ml-236b biosynthesis.
for ml-236b biosynthesis, two kinds of polyketidederived backbones, nonaketide and diketide, need to be
synthesized. our initial study focused on the cloning and
identiﬁcation of the pks genes required for ml-236b
biosynthesis from p. citrinum. targeted disruption experiments in the present study showed that two pks
genes, mlca and mlcb, were involved in the biosynthesis
of a nonaketide and a diketide moiety of ml-236b, respectively. lc/ms conﬁrmed that the mlca-disrupted
mutants, designated as the mlca series, could not produce ml-236b or its nonaketide-derived intermediates
at all. the mlcb-disrupted mutant, designated as mlcb,
was also conﬁrmed to produce the nonaketide-derived
intermediate ml-236a, suggesting that ml-236a is a
precursor of ml-236b.

compared with the lovastatin pks genes that have
been characterized recently (hendrickson et al. 1999;
kennedy et al. 1999; hutchinson et al. 2000; sutherland
et al. 2001), mlca and mlcb correspond to lovb and lovf,
respectively. mlca and mlcb show 59% and 61%
identity to lovb (lnks) and lovf (ldks), respectively. similarities and diﬀerences between the protein
sequences of the nonaketide synthases (mlca and lovb)
and the diketide synthases (mlcb and lovf) might
provide us with information on the mechanism by which
fungal type i pkss recognize b-carbonyl groups and
process the initial condensation units into the ﬁnal
products (figs. 2a and 5).
the most interesting structural diﬀerence between
ml-236b and lovastatin is that a methyl group derived
from sam can be introduced at the c-6 position of the
nonaketide of lovastatin, but not at the equivalent position in ml-236b. it is worth noting that, nevertheless,
the mt domain involved in the uptake of the methyl
group from sam was also identiﬁed in mlca and
showed relatively high similarity to the corresponding
domains in lovb, mlcb and lovf (fig. 2b). consensus
motifs present in most of the methyltransferases have
been reported and some of the motifs have been shown,
by site-directed mutagenesis, to be crucial for sam
binding (ingrosso et al. 1989; kagan and clarke 1994;
willcock et al. 1994; hamahata et al. 1996). we found
that these motifs are indeed found even in mlca, although some amino acid residues in these motifs were
not conserved. the amino acid diﬀerences found in the
mt domain might be one reason for the lack of methyltransferase activity of mlca. another reason could be
conformational diﬀerences between mlca and lovb.
site-directed mutagenesis will be needed to understand
the function of the two pkss.
4a,5-dihydro ml-236c, the putative ﬁrst intermediate, is thought to be synthesized through the release of
the nonaketide backbone from mlca. in lovastatin
biosynthesis, the nonaketide backbone produced by
lovb could not be processed correctly to 4a,5-dihydromonacolin l without the enoyl reductase activity of
lovc. lovb and lovc interacted with each other to
produce a nonaketide of the right length with the correct

arrows indicate the putative enzymatic steps catalyzed by the pkss
mlca and mlcb. at each step, acp, at and ks activities are
required for condensation of the extender unit. the activities of
dh, er, kr and mt are also required for the indicated steps.
mlcg may help in the biosynthesis of nonaketide formation.
oxidation and dehydration activities are required for steps yet to be
revealed following the putative ﬁrst intermediate 4a,5-dihydro ml236c (1) leading to ml-236a (4). the (2r)-2-methylbutyryl side
chain produced by mlcb is attached to ml-236b (5) by the
transesterase activity of mlch. 1: 4a,5-dihydro ml-236c; 2:

pattern of reduction and cyclization (kennedy et al.
1999). using an a. terreus strain with a disrupted lovc
gene, 4a,5-dihydromonacolin l was also shown to be a
precursor of lovastatin (auclair et al. 2001). mlcg, the
counterpart of lovc, may have a similar function in the
production of 4a,5-dihydro ml-236c in p. citrinum.
in the pathway proposed here, oxidation and dehydration activities are presumed to be required for the
subsequent conversion steps that lead from 4a,5-dihydro
ml-236c to ml-236a. in studies on lovastatin biosynthesis, it has been demonstrated that 4a,5-dihydromonacolin l and monacolin l can be converted to
3a-hydroxy-3,5-dihydromonacolin l and monacolin j,
respectively, in the presence of molecular oxygen using
cell-free extracts of monascus ruber (komagata et al.
1989; nakamura et al. 1990). in ml-236b biosynthesis,
conversion of ml-236c to ml-236b via ml-236a by

the mlca-disrupted mutant mlca-t1 was conﬁrmed,
suggesting that the mutant retains the enzyme responsible for the introduction of the hydroxyl moiety. the
gene mlcc encodes a putative polypeptide with similarity
to cytochrome p450 monooxygenases. the function of
lova, the counterpart of mlcc, has not been reported,
but heterologous transformation of the cosmid including
lova and some other genes in the lovastatin gene cluster
led to the production of intermediates including
monacolin j in aspergillus nidulans, suggesting that lova
may be involved in lovastatin biosynthesis (kennedy
et al. 1999). mlcc may also play a role in ml-236b
biosynthesis in p. citrinum. disruption analysis of mlcc
is required to reveal its involvement in ml-236a
formation. a conversion study using the putative
intermediates 4a,5-dihydro ml-236c and 3a-hydroxy3,5-dihydro ml-236c is underway.
the ﬁnal step in the synthesis of ml-236b is the addition of the diketide side chain to the precursor intermediate ml-236a. conversion of ml-236a to ml-236b
by mlca-t1 was also conﬁrmed, suggesting that the mutant harbors a speciﬁc enzyme with transesterase activity
required for the reaction. mlch, which codes for a putative
transesterase, may be involved in this step. in lovastatin
biosynthesis, lovd (kennedy et al. 1999), the counterpart
of mlch, has been already shown to be responsible for the
conversion of monacolin j to  xxxd2510xxx .
the function of mlcf remains unknown, but mlcf is
presumed to have oxidoreductase activity, which might

biosynthesis.
in gene clusters that are responsible for the biosynthesis of microbial secondary metabolites, other structural genes coding for resistance proteins, secretory
proteins and transcription factors are often found.
genes presumed to encode such proteins were identiﬁed
as mlcd, mlce and mlcr in the ml-236b biosynthetic
gene cluster of p. citrinum.
mlcd shows strong similarity to  xxxg1060xxx .  xxxg1060xxx  is the rate-limiting enzyme in
sterol biosynthesis in fungi. though mammals are
thought to have only one  xxxg1060xxx  gene,
more than two  xxxg1060xxx  genes have been
found to exist in fungi and plants (liscum et al. 1985;
basson et al. 1986, 1988; choi et al. 1992; burmester and
czempinski 1994; lum et al. 1996). it is not clear how
many  xxxg1060xxx  genes there are in p. citrinum, but, interestingly, one of them, mlcd, is located in
the ml-236b biosynthetic gene cluster, and the expression of mlcd appears to be related to ml-236b production. excessive transcription of mlcd may lead to
overproduction of the mlcd protein, which may protect
producers by conferring resistance to ml-236b, a
competitive inhibitor of  xxxg1060xxx . mlce
shows similarity to eﬄux pumps of the major facilitator

superfamily that confer resistance to antibiotics and
toxins. mlce may be involved in conferring resistance to
ml-236b, as well as in metabolite secretion. as shown
in fig. 1b, these two putative resistance genes, mlcd and
mlce, are transcribed before the pks and post-pks
genes required for ml-236b formation. this is compatible with the involvement of both genes in conferring
resistance to the inhibitor.
the transcriptional regulation of the ml-236b biosynthetic genes is also worth examining. mlcr contains a
putative gal4-type zinc-ﬁnger cluster. the zn(ii)2cys6type structure is a distinct feature of some of the pathwayspeciﬁc regulatory proteins found in fungi and yeasts
(laughon and gesteland 1984; burger et al. 1991; vallee
et al. 1991; woloshuk et al. 1994, 1995). one of the
gal4-type transcription factors, aﬂr, is required for
polyketide-derived aﬂatoxin biosynthesis in aspergillus
parasiticus (payne et al. 1993; woloshuk et al. 1994, 1995).
northern analysis showed that transcription of all of
the ml-236b biosynthetic genes was up-regulated on
the third day of cultivation, when ml-236b production
occurred. the expression of mlcr and some of the other
biosynthetic genes appears to be co-regulated. we presume that mlcr may play a role in the transcriptional
activation of the ml-236b biosynthetic genes. functional analysis of some of the other biosynthetic genes is
underway.
in the present study, we have identiﬁed the gene
cluster required for ml-236b biosynthesis in p. citrinum, and two pks genes in the cluster, mlca and mlcb,
were structurally and functionally characterized. further experiments are, however, required to elucidate the
mechanism of ml-236b biosynthesis in p. citrinum.
