 xxxg1379xxx   xxxg217xxx  gene expression provides a proliferative advantage in human hepatoma.  of the 2 genes ( xxxg1378xxx ,  xxxg1379xxx ) encoding methionine adenosyltransferase, the enzyme that synthesizes  xxxd3156xxx ,  xxxg1378xxx , is expressed in liver, whereas  xxxg1379xxx  is expressed in extrahepatic tissues. in liver,  xxxg1379xxx  expression associates with growth, dedifferentiation, and cancer. here, we identified the  xxxg217xxx  as a regulator of proliferation in human hepatoma cell lines. the  xxxg217xxx  has been cloned and shown to lower the k(m) of  xxxg1379xxx   xxxg831xxx  (the  xxxg1379xxx  product) for methionine and to render the enzyme more susceptible to  xxxd3156xxx  inhibition.
