abstract
to determine the potency and efficacy of  xxxg1112xxx  ligands, a w35sxgtpg s binding assay was developed and optimized for the
human  xxxg1112xxx . compounds which are known to be effective in the abortive treatment of migraine were tested for efficacy and
potency in this assay. naratriptan, sumatriptan,  xxxd3562xxx , and  xxxd3135xxx  all had agonist activity. the  xxxg1112xxx  ligand
ly334370 ž4-fluoro-n-w3-ž1-methyl-4-piperidinyl.-1 h-indol-5-ylx-benzamide. was the most potent compound tested with an ec 50 of
2.13 " 0.15 nm. ly302148 ž5-fluoro-3-w1-w2-ž1-methyl-1 h- xxxd3045xxx -4-yl.ethylx-4-piperidinylx-1 h-indole.,  xxxd2621xxx , ly306258 ž3dimethylamino-2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1 h-carbazol-6-ol., dihydroergotamine ždhe., l-694,247 and cp-122,288 were also investigated for
potency and efficacy. there was a statistically significant correlation between the pec 50 for the stimulation of w35sxgtpg s binding and
the pid50 for the inhibition of trigeminal nerve-stimulated dural plasma protein extravasation in the guinea pig. in the course of these
studies, it was found that the purportedly selective  xxxg1110xxx  receptor antagonist gr127935 inhibited  xxxg1112xxx -stimulated
w35sxgtpg s binding with a k i of 39.6 " 9.5 nm. these studies demonstrate that  xxxg1112xxx -mediated stimulation of w35sxgtpg s
binding in a clonal cell system is a reproducible, high throughput assay that is predictive of an in vivo model of  xxxg1112xxx 
activation. q 1998 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
the  xxxg1112xxx  is a member of the 5-ht1 receptor
family of g protein-coupled receptors. the human žadham
et al., 1993; lovenberg et al., 1993., rat žlovenberg et al.,
1993., mouse žamlaiky et al., 1992. and guinea pig forms
žadham et al., 1997. of the receptor have been cloned and
expressed. recently, it has been demonstrated that there is
a statistically significant correlation between the affinity
and potency of compounds for the  xxxg1112xxx  and
their potency for the inhibition of trigeminal nerve-stimulated dural plasma protein extravasation, which is used as
an animal model of migraine headache žjohnson et al.,
1997.. one consequence of activation of the  xxxg1112xxx  is the inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp formation which can be used as a functional measure of activity
at this receptor žadham et al., 1993.. however, an assay
capable of rapidly determining the potency and efficacy of

compounds at the  xxxg1112xxx  would be very useful
for testing large numbers of compounds. agonist activation of g protein-coupled receptors results in the release of
gdp from the a-subunit of the g protein and the subsequent binding of gtp. the binding of the stable analogue
w35 sxgtpg s can be used as an indicator of this receptor
activation žwieland and jakobs, 1994.. w35 sxgtpg s binding has been shown to be a useful tool for the quantification of the potency and efficacy of compounds at a variety
of g protein-coupled receptors, including the 5-ht1a

receptors. the purpose of this study was to develop a
reproducible, high throughput assay to assess the functional activation of the  xxxg1112xxx  by exploratory
compounds. the results show that  xxxg1112xxx  receptoractivated w35 sxgtpg s binding is an assay that provides
these characteristics and is predictive of compound po-

by the association for assessment and accreditation of
laboratory animal care žaaalac.. these studies were
carried out as previously described žjohnson et al., 1997;
phebus et al., 1997.. briefly, the trigeminal ganglion of
anesthetized guinea pigs was electrically stimulated to
induce ipsilateral neurogenic dural plasma protein extravasation which was measured using fluorescence methods.
the test compounds were administered intravenously 10
min prior to the trigeminal ganglion being stimulated for 3
min ž1 ma, 5 hz, 4 ms.. animals were sacrificed 15 min
following stimulation, the amount of plasma extravasation
was determined, and dose–response curves were generated.
2.4. statistical analysis
efficacy values for selected compounds were expressed
as the percent of w35 sxgtpg s binding relative to 10 m m
5-ht which was run as a standard with each concentration–response curve. nonlinear regression analysis was
performed on the concentration response curves using a
four-parameter logistic equation described by de lean et

and absence of 10 m m 5-ht while increasing the concentration of gdp from 3 nm to 1 mm. a representative
experiment is shown in fig. 1. the optimal concentration
of gdp was determined to be 10 m m. using 10 m m gdp,
the effect of changing mgcl 2 and nacl concentrations
was investigated. while holding the concentration of nacl
constant at 100 mm, the concentration of mgcl 2 added to
the assay was increased from 300 nm to 100 mm in the
presence and absence of 10 m m 5-ht žfig. 2.. similarly,
while holding mgcl 2 constant at 5 mm, the concentration
of nacl added to the assay was increased from 3 m m to 1
m in the presence and absence of 10 m m 5-ht žfig. 3..
note that there is no appreciable agonist-induced stimulation of binding until the nacl concentration reaches at
least 30 to 100 mm. the optimal concentrations of mgcl 2
and nacl were determined to be 3 mm and 120 mm,
respectively. additionally, an optimal time for incubation
at 378c was determined to be 30 min. the concentration of
w35 sxgtpg s was chosen to be 0.1 nm, since this yielded a
reproducible signal while conserving radioligand. these
conditions resulted in a very reproducible assay with a
typical signal of approximately 100% to 150% above basal
values.

human cloned  xxxg1112xxx . as has been described for
many other g protein-coupled receptors, conditions for the
 xxxg1112xxx  expressed in the lmžtky. cell were optimized. these included the concentrations of mgcl 2 , nacl
and gdp. it was determined that the best concentrations of
mgcl 2 , nacl and gdp were 3 mm, 120 mm and 10 m m,
respectively. once these conditions were established, the

d.b. wainscott et al.r european journal of pharmacology 352 (1998) 117–124

incubation time and w35 sxgtpg s concentrations were optimized to 30 min at 378c and 0.1 nm.
serotonergic inhibition of trigeminal nerve-stimulated
dural plasma protein extravasation has been attributed to a
5-ht1b mechanism in the rat or a  xxxg1110xxx  mechanism in
the guinea pig žmatsubara et al., 1991.. some confusion
exists as to the nature of these receptor interactions, due in
part to the changing nomenclature of the 5-ht1br1d receptors žhoyer et al., 1994.. thus, receptors previously referred to as  xxxg1110xxx  in the literature often likely refer to
what are now called non-rodent 5-ht1b receptors according to this new nomenclature.  xxxd3135xxx  žmk-462. in the
rat žshepheard et al., 1995., naratriptan in the rat žconnor
et al., 1997. and  xxxd3562xxx  žbw311c90. in the guinea
pig žmartin et al., 1997. have also been described as being
effective in the inhibition of trigeminal nerve-stimulated
dural plasma protein extravasation via a 5-ht1b andror
 xxxg1110xxx  receptor mechanism.
several authors have concluded that an additional 5ht1-like receptor other than 5-ht1br1d is responsible for
the effects of certain compounds for the inhibition of
trigeminal nerve-stimulated extravasation. for example,
cp-122,288 was approximately 1000-fold more potent than
sumatriptan for the inhibition of trigeminal nerve-stimulated dural plasma protein extravasation in the guinea pig
žlee and moskowitz, 1993. and in the rat žgupta et al.,
1995., while binding affinities for the compounds at human  xxxg1110xxx  žformerly  xxxg1110xxx  a . and human 5-ht1b
žformerly  xxxg1110xxx  b . receptors did not correlate with this
difference in potency žgupta et al., 1995.. in another study
in the rat, cp-122,288 was also greater than 1000-fold
more potent than sumatriptan for the inhibition of trigeminal nerve-stimulated dural plasma protein extravasation,
while there was a little difference in potency between
cp-122,288 and sumatriptan in a w35 sxgtpg s binding
assay using the cloned rat 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors
žshepherd et al., 1997.. note that in our laboratories, the
difference between the potency of cp-122,288 and sumatriptan for the inhibition of trigeminal nerve-stimulated
dural plasma protein extravasation is only about 26-fold,
since we find sumatriptan to have greater potency. this is
most likely due to a difference in experimental methodology.
cp-122,288,  xxxd3135xxx , naratriptan, sumatriptan and
 xxxd3562xxx  all had agonist activity in the  xxxg1112xxx  gtpg s
binding assay relative to 5-ht žtable 1.. there is a
statistically significant correlation between the potency of
compounds tested in the w35 sxgtpg s binding assay žcurrent study. and their w3 hx5-ht binding affinities žjohnson
et al., 1997. for the human  xxxg1112xxx  žfig. 5a.. in
addition, there is a statistically significant correlation between the potency for the stimulation of w35 sxgtpg s binding in homogenates of cells expressing the human  xxxg1112xxx 
receptor žcurrent study. and the potency for the inhibition
of trigeminal nerve-stimulated dural plasma protein extravasation in the guinea pig žtable 1; johnson et al.,

123

1997. žfig. 6.. these results provide further evidence that
the 5-ht receptor which is responsible for inhibiting dural
plasma protein extravasation in the guinea pig is the
 xxxg1112xxx .
to date, no selective  xxxg1112xxx  antagonists have
been described in the literature. gr127935 has been described as a selective antagonist for the 5-ht1br1d receptor žskingle et al., 1996.. in some studies, gr127935 has
been demonstrated to have agonist activity at the cloned
human  xxxg1110xxx  žformerly  xxxg1110xxx  a . receptor using the
inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp formation
žpauwels and colpaert, 1995., and partial agonist activity
at cloned human 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors expressed
in cell lines using a w35 sxgtpg s binding assay žwatson et
al., 1996.. gr127935 has been reported to antagonize
sumatriptan but not cp-122,288 inhibition of trigeminal
nerve-stimulated dural plasma protein extravasation in the
guinea pig žyu et al., 1997.. the authors concluded that
sumatriptan was probably acting via a 5-ht1br1d receptor
and not the  xxxg1112xxx  since gr127935 was reported
to have low affinity for the  xxxg1112xxx  in guinea pig
forebrain homogenates. in the current study, gr127935
had no efficacy as an agonist at the  xxxg1112xxx  in the
w35 sxgtpg s binding assay. however, gr-127,935 inhibited 1 m m 5-ht-stimulated binding with a k i of 39.6 nm
žfig. 7.. the measure of affinity of gr127935 for the
 xxxg1112xxx  in the present study agrees with that of
pauwels et al. ž1997., who found an affinity of 45.7 nm
when measured against w3 hx5-ht binding. it appears from
the current studies that gr127935 can antagonize  xxxg1112xxx 
receptors with reasonable potency. thus, these data
demonstrate that caution must be observed in the interpretation of results obtained using gr127935 as an antagonist
in vitro and especially in vivo.
in summary,  xxxg1112xxx -stimulated w35 sxgtpg s
binding in cells expressing the cloned human receptor is a
very reproducible, high throughput assay that can be run
using previously frozen cell pellets and is very predictive
of the potency for the inhibition of trigeminal nervestimulated dural plasma protein extravasation in the guinea
pig, an in vivo model of  xxxg1112xxx  activation.
