structure and mechanism of carbonic anhydrase
sven lindskog

abstract. carbonic anbydrase (ca; carbonate hydro-lyase, ec 4.2.1.1) is a zinc-containing enzyme
that catalyzes the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide: co2 + hz0 t) hco,- + h+. the enzyme is the
target for drugs, such as acetazolamide,  xxxd2592xxx , and  xxxd1872xxx , for the treatment of glaucoma.
there are three evolutionarily unrelated ca families, designated (y, p, and y. all known cas from the
animal kingdom are of the a type. there are seven mammalian ca isozymes with different tissue
distributions and intracellular locations, ca i-vii. crystal structures of human ca i and ii, bovine ca iii,
and murine ca v have been determined. all of them have the same tertiary fold, with a central lo-stranded
p-sheet as the dominating secondary structure element. the zinc ion is located in a cone-shaped cavity and
coordinated to three histidyl residues and a solvent molecule. inhibitors bind at or near the metal center
guided by a hydrogen-bonded system comprising glu-106 and thr-199. the catalytic mechanism of ca ii
has been studied in particular detail. it involves an attack of zinc-bound oh- on a co2 molecule loosely
bound in a hydrophobic pocket. the resulting zinc-coordinated hc03- ion is displaced from the metal ion by
h20. the rate-limiting step is an intramolecular proton transfer from the zinc-bound water molecule to his64, which serves as a proton shuttle between the metal center and buffer molecules in the reaction medium.

ca is a ubiquitous enzyme found in all animals and photosynthesizing organisms examined for its presence, as well as
in some nonphotosynthetic
bacteria. however, no fungal
ca has been described yet. one astounding new discovery
is the existence

of three evolutionarily

unrelated ca fami-

lies, which have been designated cy-, p-, and r-ca
(hewett-emmett
and tashian, 1996). there are no significant sequence

the importance of some of these residues for the stability
of human ca ii has been tested by site-specific mutagenesis. the mutation ser-29-+cys,
simply involving the replacement of an oxygen atom with the somewhat larger sulfur atom, leads to a nearly complete loss of structural
stability (martensson et al., 1992). mutants at gly-196 form
insoluble aggregates when expressed in e. coli, presumably
as a result of an impaired folding process (krebs and fierke,

but they do so much less efficiently

because their pk, values are not optima1 for the dual function as proton donor and acceptor

(engstrand et al., 1992).

to test if the location of his-64 is critical, a number of variants of his-64+ala
ca ii were constructed having his in

s. lindskog

14

positions 62,65,67, or 200. all of these, except the variant
with his-65, can shuttle protons, but only at about 5% of
the efficiency of the unmodified enzyme. the results sug
gest that his-64 not only has an optimal spatial location,
but also an environment leading to appropriate acid-base
properties (liang et al., 1993a). ren et al. (1995) have
shown that his-67 can function as a proton shuttle also in
human ca iii. a study, similar to that discussed in the previous paragraph, resulted in an estimate of an intrinsic energy barrier of 5.5 kj/mo 1 an d a “reorientation energy” of 46
kj/mol contributing to the overall energy barrier for the intramolecular proton transfer step. thus, in the ca iii
framework, the lower efficiency of his-67 as a proton shuttle compared with his-64 depends exclusively on a higher
“reorientation energy.”
in wild-type ca ii, the apparent rate constant for proton
transfer from his-64 to buffer base (eqn. 2) is almost completely independent of the chemical structure of the buffer
at a constant pka value. however, the rate constants depend
on the pk, difference between buffer and his-64, and a
bransted plot corresponding to a titration curve has been
obtained (rowlett and silverman, 1982). when the buffer
pk, exceeds 8, rate constants of about 109 m-lesec-1 have
been estimated, suggesting an almost diffusion-controlled
proton transfer reaction. in all investigated ca ii variants
with a mutation at position 64, the rates of the proton trans.
fer processes show a more or less pronounced dependence
on buffer structure. thus, not only does his-64 provide an
exceptionally facile proton transfer pathway, but it makes
the enzyme independent of the chemistry of the buffering
substances that might be encountered in the living cell.
7.3. lsozyme-specific features
although the “zinc hydroxide” mechanism probably applies
to all c&as, there are certain isozyme-specific functional
differences. in the cases of ca i and ca iii, the structural
bases of these differences are beginning to be understood.
human ca i has at least two distinctive properties.
firstly, it is less active than ca ii by a factor of about 6 on
the basis of the maximal turnover number, k,, or by a factor of 3 on the basis of its “specificity factor,” k_&,,,. secondly, ca i shows a distinct buffer specificity with much
higher activities (kat) in imidazole-type buffers than in several other buffers. this probably means that proton shuttling is less efficient in ca i than in ca ii and that additional proton transfer pathways dominate under certain
conditions (ren and lindskog, 1992).
the active site of ca i has three unique amino acid residues, val-62, his-67, and his-200 (fig. 1). results of mutagenesis experiments on human ca ii and ca i have
shown that his-200 has a major role as a determinant of the
ca i-specific kinetic properties, while vat-62 and his-67
are less important (behravan et al., 1990, 1991; engstrand
et al., 1995). it seems that his-200 stabilizes the enzymehcoj- complex (cf. section 7.2.1) and slows down the
rate of hco,- dissociation to the extent that this step can

become rate limiting in the presence of an imidazole-type
buffer. his-200 appears to have no effect on proton transfer
rates, however. the pk, of his-64 is 4.7 in human ca i, as
compared with 7.1 in human ca ii, and this low pka would
make his-64 unsuitable as a proton shuttle (campbell et al.,
1974, 1975). the cause of this pka perturbation is not
known yet, but it is possible that val-62 and his-67 are involved to some extent (engstrand et al., 1995).
ca iii is unique among the mammalian isozymes. it is
more than loo-fold less active than ca ii, it has virtually
no 4-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolase activity, and it is comparatively insensitive to inhibition by sulfonamides. furthermore, the pk, of the zinc-bound water molecule is quite
low, probably about 5 (tu et al., 1983; ren et al., 1988).
the active site contains a number of isozyme-specific residues, for example, lys-64 (arg-64 in horse ca iii), arg
67, and phe-198 (fig. 1). the replacement of these residues
with their counterparts in ca ii, his-64, asn-67, and leu198, resulted in a derivative of ca iii with kinetic properties similar to those of ca ii (lograsso et al., 1991). while
the phee198+leu mutation suffices to accomplish most of
the alterations of k_&, for co2 hydration, 4-nitrophenyl
acetate hydrolysis, and pk, of the zinc-bound water molecule, the introduction of his-64 establishes a proton shuttle
pathway greatly enhancing the maximal turnover rate, k,,,.
further experiments have demonstrated that there is an interaction between the catalytically important residue thr199 and phe-198 in ca iii (chen et al., 1993). this interaction seems to cause an attenuation of the orienting effect
of thr-199 on the zinc-bound oh- ion. thus, the replacement of thr-199 with ala in wild-type ca iii results in a
mere 4-fold decrease of k_&
for coz hydration, whereas
a 90-foid decrease is observed when the corresponding replacement is carried out in the phe-198+leu mutant.
remarkably, his-200 in ca i and phe-198 in ca iii
seem to prevent the expression of the full catalytic potentials of these isozyme structures. the biological significance
of this is an enigma.
7.4.

fl-cdmic

anhydmses

a few studies of kinetic properties of p-cas from spinach
and pea have been published (johansson and forsman, 1993,
1994; rowlett et al., 1994). the kinetic patterns are more
complex than those observed for human ca ii, but the results are consistent with a zinc-hydroxide mechanism and
the presence of a buffer-dependent proton-transfer step. the
turnover rate of the pea enzyme depends on the nature of the
buffer. a 1l;, value of 106 set-1 was calculated for the subunit
of the pea enzyme upon extrapolation to infinite concentrations of  xxxd285xxx  buffer (johansson and forsman, 1994).
thus, although the @-cas are evolutionarily unrelated to
the cx-cas,they seem to have similar catalytic capabilities.
