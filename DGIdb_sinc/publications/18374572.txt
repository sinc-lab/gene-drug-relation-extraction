abstract—diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide, hydroﬂumethiazide,  xxxd3066xxx ,  xxxd2627xxx ,  xxxd1680xxx ,  xxxd2343xxx , furosemide, and bumetanide containing primary sulfamoyl moieties were reevaluated as inhibitors of 12 human carbonic anhydrases
(hcas,  xxxg40xxx   xxxg41xxx   xxxg671xxx   xxxg703xxx .1). these drugs considerably inhibit (low nanomolar range) some ca isozymes involved in critical physiologic processes, among the 16 present in vertebrates, for example, metholazone against ca vii, xii, and xiii,  xxxd1680xxx  against ca
vb, vii, ix, xii, and xiii,  xxxd2343xxx  against ca vii, ix, xii, and xiii, furosemide against ca i, ii, and xiv, and  xxxd381xxx 
against ca ix and xii. the x-ray crystal structure of the hca ii– xxxd2343xxx  adduct was also resolved at high resolution.

carbonic anhydrase (ca,  xxxg40xxx   xxxg41xxx   xxxg671xxx   xxxg703xxx .1) inhibitors, such as
acetazolamide ( xxxd63xxx ) 1, and the structurally related sulfonamides
 xxxd2592xxx  2,  xxxd2058xxx  3, and  xxxd1872xxx  4, inhibit non-selectively all the 16 diﬀerent isoforms of this metalloenzyme characterized so far in
vertebrates.1,2 acetazolamide played a major role in
the development of renal physiology and pharmacology,
as well as for the design of many of the presently widely
used diuretic agents, such as among others the thiazide
and high ceiling diuretics.1–8 cas catalyze a very simple
physiological reaction, the interconversion between carbon dioxide and the bicarbonate ion, and are thus involved in crucial physiological processes connected
with the respiration and transport of co2/bicarbonate
between metabolizing tissues and lungs, ph and co2
homeostasis, electrolyte secretion in a variety of tissues/organs, biosynthetic reactions (such as gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, and ureagenesis), bone resorption,
calciﬁcation, tumorigenicity, and many other physiologic/pathologic processes.1–5,7,8 many cas isoforms

have been shown to be present in various tissues of the
kidney,9,10 such as ca ii, iv, vb, ix, xii, and xiv,
where these play a crucial function in at least three renal
physiological processes: (i) the acid–base balance
homeostasis; (ii) the bicarbonate reabsorption processes,
and (iii) the renal nh4 þ output.2,11,12 inhibition of both
cytosolic (ca ii) and membrane-bound (ca iv and ca
xiv) enzymes seems to be involved in the diuretic eﬀects
of these sulfonamides.2,9–12
sulfonamides 1–4 are used for the treatment of edema
due to the congestive heart failure, and for drug-induced
edema, in addition to their applications as antiglaucoma
agents.1,2,11 the structurally related compound to acetazolamide,  xxxd307xxx  5, has a renal eﬀect on bicarbonate excretion around 10 times as potent as that of
acetazolamide, but the compound remained as an orphan drug and has not been developed for clinical use.
using acetazolamide 1 as lead, a large number of other
quite successful sulfonamide diuretics were developed in
the 60s and 70s, such as benzothiadiazines 6 (hydrochlorothiazide 6a, hydroﬂumethiazide 6b, and the like),
 xxxd3066xxx  7,  xxxd2627xxx  8,  xxxd1680xxx  9,  xxxd2343xxx  10, furosemide 11, and bumetanide 12.1–3 some
of them are among the most widely clinically used
diuretics,6,11,13 and as these all possess primary so2nh2
moieties, acting as excellent zinc-binding groups for the
metal ion present within the ca active site,1–3 it is to be

expected that these should also have ca inhibitory
properties. however, this issue has been investigated
only in the 60s or 70s when these drugs were launched,
and when only one ca isozyme (i.e., ca ii) was presumed to exist and be responsible for all the physiologic
eﬀects of the sulfonamide drugs.11 here, we reinvestigate
the interaction of some of these clinically used diuretics
with all 12 catalytically active mammalian ca isoforms
and also report the x-ray crystal structure of one of
them ( xxxd2343xxx  10) with ca ii.
the data listed in table 1 show that similar to the classical cais 1–5, the clinically used sulfonamide diuretics
6–12 also act as inhibitors of all 12 investigated ca isozymes, with an inhibition proﬁle diﬀerent from that of
inhibitors investigated earlier, such as 1–5. the following should be noted from these inhibition data. (i)
hydrochlorothiazide 6a acts as a medium potency inhibitor of isoforms hca i, ii, vb, ix, and xii, with inhibition constants in the range of 290–603 nm, the
compound being a weaker inhibitor of isoforms hca
va, vi, vii, xiii, and xiv (kis in the range of
3.655–5.010 lm) and an exceedingly weak one against
hca iii (ki of 0.79 mm). (ii) hydroﬂumethiazide 6b
shows an inhibition proﬁle distinct from that of the closely structurally related 6a, being a rather eﬃcient inhibitor of the following isoforms hca ii, vb, vii, ix, xii,
and xiv, with inhibition constants in the range of 305–
435 nm. this sulfonamide is a weaker inhibitor of hca
i, iv, and vi (kis in the range of 2.84–8.25 lm) and
shows a very weak inhibition against isozymes hca
iii, va, and xiii (kis of 10.2–870 lm). thus, even
small structural changes in the benzothiadiazine scaffold, such as the substitution of the chlorine atom in
ortho to the sulfamoyl moiety by a triﬂuoromethyl
group, such as in the pair 6a/6b, have dramatic consequences for the ca inhibitory properties of the two
compounds (table 1). (iii)  xxxd3066xxx  7 is the only
diuretic among compounds 1–12 investigated here which
is not approved for clinical use in europe (but it is approved in usa),6,11b and this derivative was not available to be investigated here. the literature data6 show
it to be a very weak hca i and a modest hca ii inhibitor, with inhibition constants in the range of 1.26–
35 lm (table 1). (iv)  xxxd2627xxx  8 shows very weak
hca i and iii inhibitory properties (kis in the range
of 54–610 lm), being a low micromolar inhibitor of
hca ii, vi, and xiv, with inhibition constants in the
range of 1.714–5.432 lm. however, the drug is a medium potency inhibitor of isozymes hca iv, va, vb,
and ix (kis in the range of 216–750 nm) and a very eﬃcient one against hca vii, hca xii, and mca xiii
(kis in the range of 2.1–15 nm). (v)  xxxd1680xxx  9
also shows a very interesting inhibition proﬁle, acting
as a weak hca iii inhibitor (with a ki of 11 lm, this
compound is one of the most eﬀective hca iii inhibitors
ever detected among all known sulfonamides except triﬂuoromethanesulfonamide which has a ki of
0.9 lm),3b,15 and a rather weak hca vi and hca
xiv inhibitor (kis in the range of 1.347–4.95 lm).
 xxxd1680xxx  is a moderate hca va inhibitor (ki of
917 nm) and an eﬀective, or very eﬀective inhibitor of
the other mammalian ca isozymes. thus, the ubiqui-

tous hca i and ii, as well as hca iv, show inhibition
constants in the range of 138–348 nm, but isoforms
vb, vii, ix, xii, and xiii are inhibited in the low
nanomolar range (kis in the range of 2.8–23 nm). (vi)
 xxxd2343xxx  (the clinically used r-enantiomer) 10 acts
as an ineﬃcient ca i and iii inhibitor (kis in the range
of 51.9 to >200 lm), is a rather weak inhibitor of isoforms ca ii, va, vi, and xiv (kis in the range of
890–4950 nm) but shows signiﬁcant inhibitory activity
against ca iv and vb (kis in the range of 213–
274 nm) and excellent inhibition of ca vii, ix, xii,
and xiii, with inhibition constants in the low nanomolar range (kis in of 0.23–36 nm). these data are indeed
remarkable, also considering the wide use of the drug as
diuretic and its beneﬁcial eﬀects in patients with type 2
diabetes mellitus, as recently reported in an important
clinical trial.13 a special mention should be done regarding ca vii (ki of 0.23 nm) since this isoform is present
only within the brain, unlike other cytosolic cas.1,15b in
this organ, ca vii is involved in epileptogenesis among
others, being one of the targets of the anticonvulsant
sulfonamides and sulfamates.1,15b there are no literature data regarding a possible anticonvulsant eﬀect of
this compound, but the present data strongly suggest
one, and experiments are warranted to test this activity
which may lead to novel applications for the drug or
to the design of novel classes of ca vii-selective inhibitors.1,15b (vii) furosemide 11 acts as a very weak hca
iii inhibitor (ki of 3200 lm), but it shows moderate
inhibitory activity against many isoforms, such as ca
iv, va, vb, vi, vii, ix, xii, and xiii, with kis in
the range of 261–564 nm. the compound is, on the
other hand, a much better inhibitor of ca i, ii, and
xiv, with kis in the range of 52–65 nm. (viii)  xxxd381xxx  is again an extremely weak hca iii inhibitor (ki
of 3400 lm), similarly to furosemide with which it is
structurally related. however,  xxxd381xxx  is also a
weak inhibitor of hca i, ii, vi, and xiii (kis in the
range of 2570–6980 nm), probably due to the quite
bulky phenoxy moiety in ortho to the sulfamoyl zincbinding group. the compound shows better inhibitory
activity against isoforms ca iv, va, vb, and xiv
(kis in the range of 159–700 nm) but very good inhibition of the tumor-associated isoforms ca ix and xii
(kis in the range of 21.1–25.8 nm, that is, the same order of magnitude as acetazolamide 1,  xxxd2592xxx 
2, or  xxxd2058xxx  3) and ca vii (ki of 62 nm).
but what is the relevance of this study for the drug design of cais with diverse pharmacological applications?
up to now, these widely used drugs were considered to
be inactive as cais, due to the fact that these were
launched in a period when only ca ii was well known
(and considered as responsible of all physiologic eﬀects
of cais). it may indeed be observed that in contrast
to the classical cais of type 1–5 (generally low nanomolar ca ii inhibitors), all compounds 6–12 (except furosemide 11) are much weaker inhibitors of this isozyme,
usually in the micromolar range. indeed, only furosemide 11 is a good ca ii inhibitor among these diuretics,
with a ki of 65 nm, whereas all others show kis in the
range of 138–6980 nm (table 1). again with the exception of furosemide 11, diuretics 6–12 have low aﬃnity

cal use, with some low nanomolar (or even subnanomolar) inhibitors against many of them. examples of such
situations, are among others: metholazone 8 against
ca vii, xii, and xiii,  xxxd1680xxx  9 against ca
vb, vii, ix, xii, and xiii,  xxxd2343xxx  10 against
ca vii, ix, xii, and xiii, furosemide 11 against ca
i, ii, and xiv, and  xxxd381xxx  12 against ca ix
and xii among others (table 1). as already mentioned
above,  xxxd381xxx  12 is a tumor-speciﬁc (targeting ca
ix and xii) cai, of equal potency to acetazolamide 1,
but without the promiscuity of acetazolamide which is a
potent cai against most mammalina isozymes. indeed,
 xxxd381xxx  is a weak inhibitor of all other isoforms except ca ix and xii, which are overexpressed in tumors.17  xxxd2343xxx  10 and  xxxd1680xxx  9 are also
strong inhibitors of the tumor-associated cas, but these
are also eﬀective in inhibiting ca vii and xiii too (table 1). it is thus clear, that these old drugs may indeed
have newer applications in therapy or as experimental
agents, in situations in which the selective inhibition of
some ca isozymes is needed, and which cannot be
obtained with the presently used compounds of types
1–5.
recently, it has been observed that  xxxd2343xxx  10 in
combination with an ace inhibitor (as diuretics) are
highly beneﬁcial for the treatment of patients with
hypertension and type 2 diabetes.13 on the other hand,
classical sulfonamide cais such as acetazolamide 1,
 xxxd2592xxx  2,  xxxd2058xxx  3, and other compounds possessing such properties, are known to induce
vasodilation in a variety of tissues and organs, including
the kidneys, eye vasculature, and brain vessels.18,19
however, the exact mechanisms by which these produce
this beneﬁcial eﬀect for many pathologies (e.g., hypertension, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy), or the isoforms involved in it, are unknown for the moment.18,19
a very recent report shows that  xxxd2343xxx  10 has a
protective role against ischemia-induced injury and dysfunction of the blood–brain barrier, probably due to its
vasodilating eﬀects.20 an organ-protective eﬀect of
 xxxd2343xxx  in the animal models of renal failure has

also been reported, showing the drug to be beneﬁcial
in preventing damage to the capillary structures, the
endothelium, and in reducing the hypertrophy of superﬁcial glomeruli among others.21 all these eﬀects are
probably mediated by the inhibition of cas present in
blood vessels or in the kidneys, but no speciﬁc pharmacologic or biochemical studies are available so far, except for these clinical observations mentioned
here.13,19–21 the lesson we learn from all these data is
that probably many of the recently reported beneﬁcial
clinical properties of  xxxd2343xxx  10 are due indeed to
its diuretic eﬀects, but in conjuction with its strong inhibition of some ca isozymes (such as ca iv, vb, vii,
ix, xii, and/or xiii) reported here for the ﬁrst time,
isoforms present in kidneys and blood vessels.
in order to understand at molecular level the interactions between  xxxd2343xxx  10 and the active site of a
ca isozyme, we report here the x-ray crystal structure
of its adduct (the r-enantiomer) with the ubiquitous,
highly investigated isoform hca ii, since other isoforms
for which the compound has good aﬃnity (such as ca
vii and ix) were not crystallized yet.1–4,22–26 inspection
of the electron density maps at various stages of the
reﬁnement, showed features compatible with the presence of one molecule of  xxxd1171xxx  bound within the
active site (fig. 1).27–31 interactions between the protein
and zn2+ ion were entirely preserved in the adduct, as in
all other hca ii–sulfonamide/sulfamate/sulfamide complexes investigated so far.23–26 analysis of the threedimensional structure of the complex revealed a compact binding between the inhibitor and the enzyme active site, with the tetrahedral geometry of the zn2+
binding site and the key hydrogen bonds between the
so2nh2 moiety of the inhibitor and enzyme active site
all retained (figs. 2 and 3, and table 2).22–26 in particular, the ionized nitrogen atom of the sulfonamide group
of 10 is coordinated to the zinc ion at a distance of
2.15 å. this nitrogen is also hydrogen bonded to the hydroxyl group of thr199 (n–thr199og = 2.86 å), which
in turn interacts with the glu106oe1 atom (2.5 å, data
not shown). one oxygen atom of the sulfonamide moi-

other adducts of hca ii with sulfonamides such as a

interaction was in fact demonstrated to be highly important for the orientation of the inhibitor within the active
site and for the potency of a sulfonamide as cai against
this isoform.8 the second feature which is salient for the
adduct of 10 with hca ii regards the stacking interaction in which phe131 participate with the phenylene
moiety of the bicyclic ring present in  xxxd2343xxx . as
seen from figures 2 and 3, the two rings, that is, the

in conclusion, we investigated whether the widely used
benzothiadiazines and high ceiling diuretics, such as
hydrochlorothiazide, hydroﬂumethiazide,  xxxd3066xxx ,
 xxxd2627xxx ,  xxxd1680xxx ,  xxxd2343xxx , furosemide,
and bumetanide, which contain primary sulfamoyl moieties acting as potential zinc-binding functions, may act as
inhibitors of 12 catalytically active mammalian cas.
these drugs are widely used clinically and were launched
in a period when only isoform ca ii was known and considered physiologically/pharmacologically relevant, and
thus no inhibition data against other ca isoforms are
available in the literature. although acting as moderate–weak inhibitors of ca ii, and ca i, all these drugs
considerably inhibit other ca isozymes known nowadays
to be involved in critical physiologic processes, among the
16 cas present in vertebrates. some low nanomolar (or
even subnanomolar) inhibitors against such isoforms
were detected, such as metholazone against ca vii,
xii, and xiii,  xxxd1680xxx  against ca vb, vii, ix,
xii, and xiii,  xxxd2343xxx  against ca vii, ix, xii,
and xiii, furosemide against ca i, ii, and xiv, and
 xxxd381xxx  against ca ix and xii. the x-ray crystal
structure of the ca ii– xxxd2343xxx  adduct was also resolved at high resolution, showing features that may be
useful for the drug design of novel classes of cais. we
also propose that the recently observed beneﬁcial eﬀect
of  xxxd2343xxx  for the treatment of patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes is due to its potent inhibition
of ca isoforms present in kidneys and blood vessels,
which explain both the blood pressure lowering eﬀects
and organ-protective activity of the drug.

khalifah, r. g. j. biol. chem. 1971, 246, 2561, an
applied photophysics (oxford, uk) stopped-ﬂow instrument has been used for assaying the ca catalyzed co2
hydration activity. phenol red (at a concentration of
0.2 mm) has been used as indicator, working at the
absorbance maximum of 557 nm, with 10 mm hepes (ph
7.5) as buﬀer, 0.1 m na2so4 (for maintaining constant the
ionic strength), following the ca-catalyzed co2 hydration
reaction. the co2 concentrations ranged from 1.7 to
17 mm for the determination of the kinetic parameters
and inhibition constants. for each inhibitor at least six
traces of the initial 5–10% of the reaction have been used
for determining the initial velocity. the uncatalyzed rates
were determined in the same manner and subtracted from
the total observed rates. stock solutions of inhibitor
(10 mm) were prepared in distilled-deionized water with
10–20% (v/v) dmso (which is not inhibitory at these
concentrations) and dilutions up to 0.01 lm were done
thereafter with distilled-deionized water. inhibitor and
enzyme solutions were preincubated together for 15 min at
room temperature prior to assay, in order to allow for the
formation of the e-i complex. the inhibition constants
were obtained by non-linear least-squares methods using
prism 3, and represent the mean from at least three
diﬀerent determinations.

31. the hca ii–10 adduct was crystallized as previously
described.25,26 crystallographic reﬁnement of the adduct
was performed at a ﬁnal resolution of 2.1 å. diﬀraction
data were collected under cryogenic conditions (100 k) on a
ccd detector km4 ccd/sapphire using cuka radiation
(1.5418 å). data were processed with crysalis red
(oxford diﬀraction 2006).32 the structure was analyzed
by diﬀerence fourier technique, using the pdb ﬁle 1ca2 as
a starting model. the reﬁnement was carried out with the
program refmac5;33 model building and map inspections were performed using the coot program.34 the ﬁnal
model of the complex  xxxg293xxx / xxxd2343xxx  had an r-factor of
22.8% and r-free 29.0% in the resolution range 20.0–2.1 å,
with a rms deviation from standard geometry of 0.015 å in
bond lengths and 1.8 in angles. the correctness of the
stereochemistry was ﬁnally checked using procheck.35
coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with
the protein data bank (accession code 3bl1).
