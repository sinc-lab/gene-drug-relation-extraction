abstract
in the central nervous system,  xxxg2099xxx  2 (vmat2) is the only transporter that moves cytoplasmic dopamine (da) into synaptic vesicles for storage
and subsequent exocytotic release. pharmacologically
enhancing da sequestration by vmat2, and thus preventing the oxidation of da in the cytoplasm, may be a strategy
for treating diseases such as parkinson’s disease. vmat2
may also be a novel target for the development of treatments for psychostimulant abuse. this review summarizes
the possible role of vmat2 as a therapeutic target, vmat2
ligands reported in the literature, and the structure-activity
relationship of these ligands, including  xxxd3330xxx  analogs,  xxxd2419xxx  analogs, lobeline analogs, and 3 xxxd2850xxx -2phenylpropene analogs. the molecular structure of vmat2
and its relevance to ligand binding are briefly discussed.

introduction
the  xxxg2099xxx  ( xxxg2099xxx ), a member of
the vesicular  xxxg2148xxx  family, is responsible for the translocation of monoamines (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and histamine) from the cytoplasm
into synaptic vesicles via a proton electrochemical gradient
generated by the vacuolar type h+-adenosine triphosphatase.1 two pharmacologically distinct  xxxg2099xxx  isoforms,
 xxxg2098xxx  and vmat2, have been cloned and described.2-4
adult human and rodent monoaminergic neurons of the central nervous system (cns) and sympathetic postganglionic
neurons express only vmat2,5-7 while  xxxg2098xxx  is predominantly expressed in neuroendocrine cells such as chromaffin
cells of the adrenal medulla and enterochromaffin cells of the

intestinal tract.5-7 vmat2 is also expressed in at least 2
endocrine cell populations and in neurons.6 both  xxxg2098xxx 
and vmat2 are more widely expressed during embryonic
development.8 substrate recognition and inhibitor sensitivities for differences between  xxxg2098xxx  and vmat2 have been
studied using membrane vesicles prepared from stable transformed cell lines from chinese hamster ovaries (cho) that
express the respective proteins.9 vmat2 has a consistently
higher affinity for all of the monoamine substrates tested,
particularly histamine, and has a greater sensitivity than
 xxxg2098xxx  to the inhibitor  xxxd3330xxx  ( xxxd3330xxx ).
the natural alkaloid reserpine and  xxxd3330xxx  are considered 2 classical  xxxg2099xxx  inhibitors.10 reserpine inhibits the transport of
amines into chromaffin granules and synaptic storage vesicles11,12 by binding with high affinity to  xxxg2099xxx , presumably at
the amine recognition site. it has been suggested that  xxxd3330xxx , on
the other hand, binds to a site on  xxxg2099xxx  that is different from
the substrate binding site at which reserpine interacts.12-14

vmat2 and neuroprotection
oxidative deamination of monoamines by monoamine oxidase is accompanied by the reduction of molecular oxygen
to a toxic product,  xxxd2298xxx .15 therefore, maintenance of low cytoplasmic concentrations of neurotransmitters by their reuptake into synaptic vesicles for storage is
important to minimize their inherent toxicity.16 furthermore, storage of neurotransmitters in synaptic vesicles precludes their metabolism in the cytoplasmic compartment
and reduces the synthetic demands on the cell.16 in the central nervous system, vmat2 is the only transporter that
moves cytoplasmic dopamine (da) into synaptic vesicles
for storage and subsequent exocytotic release.1
parkinson’s disease is a degenerative, progressive disorder
that dramatically affects neurons of the substantia nigra and
the basal ganglia. the etiology of parkinson’s disease has
not been elucidated, but exposure to endogenous or environmental toxins may contribute to the development of the
disease.17-21 in this regard, da may play a role as an endogenous toxin, since the normal metabolism of da produces
 xxxd2298xxx  as a byproduct, and the formation of
da-associated reactive oxygen species may contribute to

the loss of nigrostriatal da neurons.22 accordingly, pharmacologically enhancing da sequestration by vmat2, and
thus preventing the oxidation of da in the cytoplasm, may
be a strategy for treatment of parkinson’s disease.
exposure to the neurotoxin n-methyl-4-phenyltetrahydropyridine (mptp) results in clinical symptoms closely approximating parkinson’s disease.17 n-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium
(mpp+), the active toxic metabolite of mptp, is a substrate for
vmat2.23-27 vmat2 sequesters mpp+ in synaptic vesicles
and thereby protects catecholamine-containing neurons from
mpp+-induced toxicity and degeneration.3,28-32 cho cells,
which are normally sensitive to mpp+ toxicity, because they
lack a plasma membrane amine transporter, can be made relatively insensitive to mpp+ toxicity by transfection with  xxxg2099xxx 
complementary dna.3 in addition, when the transfected cho
cells are treated with reserpine, which inhibits vmat2 function, the cells then become sensitive to mpp+ toxicity.3 other
studies using heterozygous vmat2 knockout mice show that
the knockouts are more susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of
mptp compared with the wild-type mice.28,30,33 furthermore,
heterozygous vmat2 knockout mice are more sensitive to
methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity and are more vulnerable to the toxic effects of  xxxd2471xxx 
(l-dopa, a da precursor used to treat parkinson’s disease)
compared with wild-type mice.34,35 the latter results suggest
that reduction in vmat2 activity might attenuate the efficacy
of l-dopa therapy in parkinson’s patients. finally, increased
sequestration of da in synaptic vesicles by vmat2 has been
suggested to be protective in parkinson’s disease.36
recently, studies have suggested that pharmacological agents
that increase vmat2 activity are neuroprotective. for example, methylphenidate increases vesicular da uptake in rats
and prevents persistent dopaminergic deficits induced by highdose methamphetamine administration.37,38 pramipexole, a
da d2/d3 agonist used as a therapy for parkinson’s disease,
increases vesicular da uptake and protects against the loss of
nigrostriatal da neurons in methamphetamine-, 3-acetylpyridine-, and ischemia-induced neurotoxicity.39-41 additionally,
apomorphine, a da d2/d3 agonist used in europe as a treatment for parkinson’s disease and for impotence, increases
vesicular da uptake, and this mechanism has been suggested
to be important for its associated neuroprotection.42
taken together, the results of the above studies indicate that
vmat2 expression and function are important in counteracting the neurotoxicity of mpp+ and perhaps of other environmental and endogenous neurotoxins that play an etiologic
role in neurodegenerative disease.21

vmat2 and psychostimulant abuse
psychostimulant-induced behavioral activation and reinforcement are mediated, at least in part, via interaction with

neurotransmitter transporters that regulate synaptic da concentrations.43-45 recent studies have demonstrated that psychostimulants alter vmat2 function.46,47 cocaine inhibits
 xxxg2149xxx  function, induces a rapid and reversible
increase in vesicular da uptake and dihydrotetrabenazine
(dtbz) binding, and causes a shift in the ratio of cytoplasmic to vesicular da, all of which suggests that vmat2
may be a novel target for the development of treatments for
cocaine abuse.48 amphetamine and its analogs, such as
methamphetamine, decrease vesicular da sequestration by
inhibiting vesicular uptake and promoting release from the
vesicles.49,50 amphetamine diffuses across the vesicular
membrane, decreasing the ph gradient, which results in the
loss of free energy needed for monoamine sequestration.49-52
also, amphetamine that accumulates in the vesicles competes
with monoamines for protons, resulting in an increase in the
diffusion of uncharged monoamines out of the vesicle.52
high-dose methamphetamine treatment decreases vesicular
da uptake and dtbz binding, suggesting that there is a
significant alteration in vmat2 function and localization at
the vesicular membrane.53 vmat2 heterologous knockout
mice exhibit reduced amphetamine-conditioned place preference (reward) and enhanced sensitivity to the locomotor
effects of apomorphine, ethanol, cocaine, and amphetamine.28,54 vmat2 knockout studies also indicate that
vmat2 plays an important role in mediating the behavioral
effects of psychostimulants. taken together, these results
support the idea that vmat2 should be considered as a valid
target for the development of pharmacotherapies to treat
psychostimulant abuse. other evidence supporting the role
of vmat2 in psychostimulant pharmacology is the finding
that benzoquinolizine derivatives, such as  xxxd3330xxx , which have
high affinity for vmat2, decrease locomotor activity and aggressiveness in monkeys55 and decrease methamphetamineinduced hyperactivity in rodent animal models.55

vmat2 ligands
 xxxd3330xxx  and its analogs
 xxxd3330xxx  (1, figure 1), a benzoquinolizine compound, has been
shown to deplete cerebral monoamines in rat brain by reversibly inhibiting vmat2.56 first introduced in 1956 as an antipsychotic drug,57  xxxd3330xxx  is currently used to treat hyperkinetic
movement disorders, such as chorea associated with
huntington’s disease, tics in tourette’s syndrome, and
movement stereotypes in tardive dyskinesia.58-60 the side
effects associated with  xxxd3330xxx  include sedation, depression,
akathisia, and parkinsonism.58  xxxd3330xxx  inhibits catecholamine
uptake by vmat2 with a ki of 3 nm14 and acts as an inhibitor
of both presynaptic and postsynaptic da receptors in rat
brain.61 [11c] xxxd3330xxx  (label on the 9-o-methyl group) has been
synthesized62 and used as an in vivo radioligand for positron
emission tomography (pet) imaging of vmat2.63-66

phy (hplc). the (+)-isomer (2r,3r,11br, 3a)74 shows
high affinity in vitro (ki = 0.97 nm) for rat vmat2, whereas
the (–)-isomer shows very low affinity for vmat2 (ki = 2.2
mum). thus the binding of a-dtbz to vmat2 is enantioselective, with the (+)-isomer having higher affinity.75,76
another 4 possible dtbz isomers (2s,3s,11br, 3e; 2r,3r,11bs,
3f; 2r,3s,11br, 3g; 2s,3r,11bs, 3h, figure 3) have been synthesized and tested for inhibition of vmat2 binding using rat vesicular membranes. isomer 3g showed the highest affinity (ki = 28
nm) in the [3h]dtbz binding assay.77,78
figure 1. structures of  xxxd3330xxx  and its analogs (1-4).

 xxxd3330xxx  analogs have been synthesized with different alkyl
groups at the c-3 position in the molecule, such as compound ro 4-1632 (2, figure 1). these analogs retain good
amine-depleting activity.55
in vivo,  xxxd3330xxx  is rapidly and extensively metabolized to its
reduced form, dtbz (3, figure 1).67 [3h]dtbz (label on
the c-2 hydrogen) has been used as a selective radioligand
in in vitro brain homogenate binding studies and in autoradiographic studies, and is reported to have a kd value of 3.0
nm.13,14,68-70 [11c]dtbz (label on the 9-o-methyl group)
has also been synthesized71 and used for in vivo pet imaging of vmat2.66,72
 xxxd3330xxx  contains 2 chiral carbon centers at c-3 and c-11b;
thus, theoretically,  xxxd3330xxx  can exist as 4 possible stereoisomers (3r,11br; 3s,11bs; 3r,11bs; and 3s,11br).  xxxd3330xxx 
usually refers to the racemic compound, that is, a 1:1 mixture of the 3r,11br and 3s,11bs isomers. synthetic dtbz,
the product of hydride reduction of the 2-keto group of  xxxd3330xxx ,
can exist in 2 a-dtbz forms (2r,3r,11br, 3a; and
2s,3s,11bs, 3b, figure 2) and 2 b-dtbz forms (2s,3r,11br,
3c; and 2r,3s,11bs, 3d, figure 2). a-dtbz and b-dtbz
can be separated by column chromatography, and the
a-dtbz isomer (ki = 6 nm) shows slightly higher binding
affinity in vitro for rat brain vmat2 than does b-dtbz (ki =
20 nm).73 the 2 enantiomers of a-dtbz have been separated using chiral high performance liquid chromatogra-

methoxytetrabenazine (mtbz) (4, figure 1) is another
 xxxd3330xxx  analog with high affinity (kd = 3.9 nm) for vmat2.79
similar to dtbz, [3h] and [11c]mtbz have also been synthesized73 and used in in vitro and in vivo studies.79-81
nucleophilic addition of organometallic reagents to the c-2
keto group of  xxxd3330xxx  generated a series of 2-alkylated dtbz
analogs, such as the  xxxd26xxx , 2-et, 2-pr, 2-iso-pr, and 2-iso-bu
derivatives (all racemic mixtures, figure 4).82-85 these compounds have been evaluated for inhibition of [3h]mtbz
binding to vmat2 in rat striatum.85 the b-methyl compound 5a showed the highest affinity (ki = 2.6 nm) in this
series, with a nearly 5-fold higher affinity than its diastereomer 5b (ki = 12 nm), which is consistent with the finding
that a-dtbz exhibits higher affinity for vmat2 than does
b-dtbz.73 compound 5b and compounds 6 to 9 all contain
a b-hydroxyl group and showed a general decrease in binding affinity upon either lengthening or branching of the
alkyl group at c-2.85 these results indicate that analogs
containing considerable steric bulk at position 2 can be tolerated. thus, compound 10 (figure 4), in which an 125i atom
has been introduced for autoradiographic studies of vmat2,
has been synthesized.86 (±)-compound 10 can be separated
by chiral hplc into its optical isomers, and the first eluted
enantiomer binds to vmat2 with a kd of 0.22 nm.87
structure-activity relationship (sar) studies involving  xxxd3330xxx 
analogs have shown that quaternization of the amine nitrogen at position 5, aromatization of ring c, and elimination
of the carbonyl group afforded compounds that were devoid

of monoamine-depleting activity.55,88 thus, a basic amine
nitrogen at position 5 is a prerequisite for  xxxd3330xxx -like activity.89 also, methoxy groups at positions 9 and 10 appear to
be essential for  xxxd3330xxx -like activity; the methylenedioxy compound 11 (figure 5) was 3 orders of magnitude less potent
than ro 4-1284 (6).90
replacing the carbonyl oxygen in  xxxd3330xxx  with a bis-methylthio
group (compound 12, figure 5) affords a compound with
similar activity to  xxxd3330xxx .91 olefination of the carbonyl group
to afford compound 13 (figure 5) (ec50 = 14 nm) resulted
in potent inhibition of [3h]dtbz binding.92
based upon a limited number of  xxxd3330xxx  analogs (14-17, figure 6), a correlation between the lipophilicity of the analogs
and their affinity for the dtbz binding site has been established.93 compounds shown to have higher partition coefficients (octanol/buffer) generally exhibited a greater ability
to inhibit the specific binding of [3h]dtbz (ic50 = 6 nm
for 14, 47 nm for 17, 110 nm for 16, and 2500 nm for 15)
to vmat2.93 accordingly, compound 20 (figure 6), an
iodinated and photosensitive derivative of  xxxd3330xxx , has been
synthesized and exhibited an ic50 of 428 nm to inhibit
[3h]dtbz binding.92 however, both its precursor ( xxxd774xxx , ic50 = 8.1 nm) and the non-iodinated analog (19,
ic50 = 53 nm) of compound 20 showed higher affinity at
vmat2 than did compound 20.92
several derivatives of compound 16 (ie, compounds 21-24,
figure 7) have been synthesized; of these, the amino compounds 21 and 22 retained affinity for vmat2 (ki = 7.6 nm
and 72.2 nm, respectively, in the [125i]iodovinyl- xxxd3330xxx  binding assay), whereas the amido compounds 23 and 24 exhibited diminished affinity for vmat2 (ki = 730 nm and >10
000 nm, respectively, in the [125i]iodovinyl- xxxd3330xxx  binding
assay).94

granules and synaptic vesicles.96-98 in the studies by darchen
et al,96 henry et al,97 and leysen et al,98  xxxd2419xxx  competitively inhibited the binding of [3h]dtbz to vmat2, and
conversely,  xxxd3330xxx  displaced [3h] xxxd2419xxx  binding.
[3h] xxxd2419xxx  binds to the  xxxd3330xxx  binding site with a kd of
45 nm at 30ºc and a kd of 6 nm at 0ºc.96
a  xxxd2419xxx  derivative, 7-azidoketanserin (26, figure 8),
also binds to the  xxxd3330xxx  binding site of bovine chromaffin
granule membranes with a ki of 23 nm (inhibition of
[3h]dtbz binding).99 an iodinated azido derivative of  xxxd2419xxx , 7-azido-8-iodoketanserin (27, figure 8), binds to
the same specific  xxxd3330xxx  binding site as  xxxd2419xxx  with a kd
of 5.5 nm at 0ºc99; 7-azido-8-[125i]iodoketanserin has been
successfully used for photoaffinity labeling of  xxxd3330xxx  binding
sites of different tissues, including rat striatum, rabbit
platelets, human pheochromocytoma, and human adrenal
medulla.99
lengthening the distance between the piperidine and the
benzoyleneurea moieties of the  xxxd2419xxx  molecule by
addition of 2 methylene groups results in a compound (28,
figure 9) that exhibits a 20-fold decrease in affinity (ki =
950 nm) for the [3h]dtbz binding site.96 reducing the
keto group of  xxxd2419xxx  (compound 29, figure 9) also
decreases affinity (ki = 350 nm) for this site. additionally,
replacing the benzoyleneurea moiety with other heterocycles (eg, compounds 30-32, figure 9) also decreases affinity
(ki = 950, 814, and 3600 nm, respectively) for the [3h]dtbz
binding site. however, minor structural changes to the

benzoyleneurea moiety, such as introducing a hydroxyl
group into the ring ( xxxd3171xxx , figure 9) or replacing 1 of
the oxygen atoms with a sulfur atom (compound 34, figure
9), retains the affinity (ki = 14 and 40 nm, respectively).96
lobeline and its analogs
a lipophilic alkaloid from lobelia inflata, (–)-lobeline
(lobeline, 2r,6s,10s-, 35, figure 10), displaces [3h]nicotine
binding from native nicotinic receptors in the cns with
high affinity (ki = 4-30 nm).100-104 although lobeline has
no structural resemblance to nicotine, and sars do not suggest a common pharmacophore,105 it has many nicotinelike
effects, such as tachycardia and hypertension,106 bradycardia and hypotension in anesthetized rats,107 anxiolytic
activity,108 and improvement of learning and memory.109 in
contrast to nicotine, lobeline only marginally supports selfadministration in mice110 and does not support self-administration in rats.111 additionally, chronic lobeline treatment
does not increase locomotor activity in rats and does not
produce conditioned place preference.112,113 thus, lobeline and nicotine have different effects in behavioral and

neurochemical studies, suggesting that they do not act via a
common mechanism. nevertheless, lobeline has often been
considered to be a nicotinic receptor agonist. conversely,
we and others have established that lobeline acts as a potent,
but nonselective, nicotinic receptor antagonist.104,114-117
lobeline inhibits nicotine-evoked [3h]da overflow from
rat striatal slices with an ic50 of 1 mum, suggesting that lobeline acts as an antagonist at nicotinic receptors mediating
nicotine-evoked da release (ie, a6b2b3* subtype).116 lobeline
also inhibits nicotine-evoked 86rb+ efflux from rat thalamic
synaptosomes with an ic50 of 0.7 mum, indicating that lobeline is also an antagonist at a4b2* nicotinic receptors.116
moreover, lobeline also inhibits [3h]methyllycaconitine
binding to rat brain membranes with a ki of 6.26 mum, indicating that there is an interaction with the a7* nicotinic
receptor subtype.117 lobeline has also been reported to
be an antagonist (ic50 of 8.5 mum) at human a7* nicotinic
receptors expressed in xenopus oocytes.118
in addition to interacting with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs), lobeline inhibits [3h]dtbz binding to
vmat2 with an ic50 of 0.90 mum and inhibits [3h]da
uptake into rat striatal vesicle preparations with an ic50 of
0.88 mum.119,120 therefore, lobeline is a nonselective nachr
antagonist that also inhibits vmat2 function. importantly,
lobeline has been shown to inhibit both the neurochemical
and the behavioral effects of amphetamine in rodents.111,121-123
the mechanism underlying the lobeline-induced inhibition
of these effects has been suggested to be noncompetitive
inhibition of vmat2 function.114 the observation that lobeline
is not self-administered is consistent with findings that lobeline does not evoke da release.111,114,119 furthermore, the
observation that lobeline inhibits methamphetamine-evoked
da release from superfused rat striatal slices116 is consistent with its ability to decrease methamphetamine selfadministration in rats.123 these studies clearly implicate
vmat2 as a potential target for the development of
agents to treat methamphetamine abuse. regardless,
lobeline is a novel prototypical molecule from which
subtype-selective nachr ligands and selective vmat2
inhibitors may be developed following appropriate structural modification.
systematic structural modification of the lobeline molecule
provided 2 non-oxygen-containing lobeline analogs:
n-methyl-2,6-di-(cis-phenylethenyl)piperidine (meso-transdiene [mtd], 36a, figure 11) and n-methyl-2,6-di-(cisphenylethyl)piperidine (lobelane, 37a, figure 11). the latter

figure 11. structures of lobeline analogs (36a-c and 37a-c).

2 analogs showed affinity for vmat2 at the  xxxd3330xxx  binding
site (ki of 9.88 mum for 36a, and 0.97 mum for 37a), with
negligible affinity for the ligand binding sites on a4b2* and
a7* nachrs.117,124 compounds 36b and 36c (figure 11)
are 2 stereoisomers of 36a; 36c was equipotent with its
meso-isomer, mtd, but 36b was slightly less potent (2- to
3-fold) than mtd at vmat2. within the lobelane series of
compounds (ie, compounds 37a, 37b, and 37c, figure 11), a
change in c2, c6 stereochemistry from cis to trans afforded
a modest reduction (5- to 6-fold) in affinity at vmat2. the
trans enantiomers 37b and 37c exhibited comparable affinities at vmat2. these data indicate that the vmat2 binding site is not sensitive to major stereochemical changes to
the mtd and lobelane molecules at the c2 and c6 piperidino ring carbons.
interestingly, 2 conformationally flexible, ring-opened compounds, 38a and 38b (figure 12) (ki = 5.21 and 3.96 mum,
respectively) and 2 acyclic compounds, 39 and 40 (figure
12) (ki = 2.37 and 3.07 mum, respectively), exhibited lower,
but comparable, affinity for vmat2 compared with lobelane. thus, ring opening or complete removal of the piperidine ring results in only a modest reduction in affinity at
vmat2 compared with lobelane (37a). the presence of a
basic amine functionality is likely a prerequisite for vmat2
recognition, as is evidenced by the fact that quaternized
compounds 41 (ki > 100 mum) and 42 (ki = 16.5 mum) (figure 12) show significant loss in affinity for vmat2.124
the entire lobelane structure appears to be critical for highaffinity binding at vmat2, since fragments of lobelane or
mtd, such as compounds 43 and 44 (figure 13) (both ki >
100 mum), exhibited no affinity for vmat2.125

figure 12. structures of lobeline analogs (38a-b and 39-42).

isomerized lobelane analogs, such as compound 45 (figure
14) (ki = 1.36 mm), retained affinity for vmat2, indicating
that the position of the piperidine n atom relative to the c2
and c6 side chains does not appear to be critical for vmat2
interaction, and that the vmat2 binding site can tolerate
changes in distance between the piperidine nitrogen and the
2 phenyl rings.125 in the lobelane structure, changes in the
n-substituent can also be tolerated. nor-lobelane (46, ki =
2.31 mm), nor-n-ethyl lobelane (47, ki = 3.41 mm), and
nor-n-n-propyl lobelane (48, ki = 1.87 mm) (figure 14)
exhibit only a slight decrease in affinity for vmat2 compared with lobelane.125 replacing the phenyl rings of lobelane with naphthalene rings (compound 49, ki = 0.63 mm) or
introducing substituents into the phenyl rings (eg, in compounds 50, ki = 0.57 mm; 51, ki = 0.43 mm; and 52, ki =
0.52 mm) (figure 14) retains or somewhat improves affinity
at vmat2.
to increase the rigidity of the lobelane molecule, analogs
were prepared in which the piperidine ring has been replaced
with a tropene ring. the resulting compounds (53, ki = 1.30
mm; 54, ki = 1.38 mm; and 55, ki = 4.80 mm) (figure 15)
exhibited affinity at vmat2 comparable with lobelane.126
3-amino-2-phenylpropene derivatives
recently, a series of 3-amino-2-phenylpropene derivatives
(figure 16) have been reported as novel competitive inhibitors of the bovine chromaffin granule membrane  xxxg2099xxx  (bvmat2).127 with a ki of 40.3 mm,

position of app affords compounds 57 (ki = 16.7 mm) and
58 (ki = 15.5 mm), respectively, equally improved potency
for bvmat2. however, compound 59 (ki = 103 mm), which
has a methoxyl group at the 4 position of the phenyl ring of
app, led to a decrease in potency. however, compound 60,
in which a methoxyl group is at the 3 position of the phenyl
ring, led to a slight improvement in inhibitory potency with
respect to app. methyl (61, ki = 55.9 mm) or fluoro (62, ki =
42.3 mm) substitution at the 4 position of the phenyl ring
had no effect on the inhibitory potency, while chloro (63),
bromo (64), and iodo (65) substitution led to a modest
increase in inhibitory potency (ki = 18.0, 17.7, and 12.9
mm, respectively).

to form an ion pair and appear to provide a structural framework for substrate recognition.129 experiments employing a
chimera of  xxxg2098xxx  and vmat2 indicate that 2 domains,
tmd5 through tmd8 and tmd9 through tmd12, cooperate to confer the high-affinity interaction of vmat2 with
 xxxd3330xxx  and histamine.130 in addition, the domain encompassing tmd3 and tmd4 influences serotonin affinity but not
histamine affinity or  xxxd3330xxx  sensitivity.130 the domain encompassing tmd5 through tmd7 of vmat2 in the context of
n-terminal vmat2 sequences reduces the apparent affinity
for serotonin but not histamine or the sensitivity to  xxxd3330xxx .130
tyrosine 434 and aspartate 461 in tmd9 through tmd12
are identified as being responsible for the high-affinity interaction of  xxxd3330xxx , histamine, and serotonin, but not for da.131
photoaffinity labeling of purified rat vmat2 indicates that
tmd1 and tmd10/11 are possibly juxtaposed and may
interact in a functionally significant manner.132 cysteine
mutagenesis and derivatization of human vmat2 revealed
that cysteines 439, 476, and/or 497, and possibly cysteines
126 and/or 333, are important for [3h]tbzoh binding, and
cysteines 176, 207, and 439 together are important for
[3h]serotonin transport.133 furthermore, a disulfide bond
between lumenal cysteine 126 in loop 1/2 and cysteine 333
in loop 7/8 has been identified.134

conclusion
vmat2 structure and molecular basis
for binding
predictions regarding the molecular structure of vmat2
from its protein sequence are that it comprises 12 putative
transmembrane domains (tmds) with both n- and c- termini in the cytoplasm and a large, hydrophobic, n-glycosylated loop between tmds 1 and 2 facing the vesicle lumen.1
structural biology studies have identified important residues that may contribute to ligand binding and monoamine
transport. mutagenesis studies indicate that aspartate 33,
which contains a negative charge, in tmd1 and serines 180
to 182 in tmd3 of vmat2 play a critical role in substrate
recognition, presumably by interacting with the protonated
amino group of the ligand and hydroxyl groups on the catechol or indole ring, respectively.128 in addition, lysine 139
in tmd2 and aspartate 427 in tmd11 of vmat2 interact

significant progress has been made over the last 20 years in
elucidating the role of vmat2 in monoamine transport and
its potential as a therapeutic target. vmat2 sequesters cytoplasmic da and thus prevents the oxidation of da in the
cytoplasm; vmat2 also sequesters neurotoxins within vesicles. these data indicate that vmat2 may play a role in
neuroprotection and that molecules that interact with
vmat2 may have value as treatments for diseases such as
parkinson’s disease. vmat2 may also be a novel target for
the development of treatments for psychostimulant abuse,
and the discovery of molecules that modulate vmat2 function may afford useful tools for examining the pivotal role
of this transporter in the neurochemical and behavioral
effects of psychostimulant drugs, thus providing potential
pharmacotherapies.
