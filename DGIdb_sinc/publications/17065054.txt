to study in detail the relation between gene expression and resistance against gemcitabine,
a cell line was isolated from a tumor for which gemcitabine resistance was induced in vivo.
similar to the in vivo tumor, resistance in this cell line, c 26-g, was not related to deficiency of
 xxxg611xxx  ( xxxg611xxx ). micro-array analysis showed increased expression of ribonucleotide
reductase (rr) subunits m1 and m2 as confirmed by real time pcr analysis (28- and 2.7fold, respectively). in cell culture, moderate cross-resistance (about 2-fold) was observed to 1-ß-darabinofuranosylcytosine ( xxxd1790xxx ), 2-chloro-2’deoxyadenosine (cda), ly231514 (alimta), and
cisplatin ( xxxd1709xxx ), and pronounced cross-resistance (>23-fold) to 2 ,2 -difluorodeoxyuridine (dfdu)
and 2 ,2 -difluorodeoxyguanosine (dfdg). culture in the absence of gemcitabine reduced resistance
as well as  xxxg1991xxx  rna expression, demonstrating a direct relationship of  xxxg1991xxx  rna expression
with acquired resistance to gemcitabine.

introduction
in most in vitro studies, the main resistance mechanism against gemcitabine (2 ,2 -difluorodeoxycytidine,  xxxd2188xxx , gemzar) is decreased activity of
 xxxg611xxx ,[1,2] which enzyme is responsible for its initial phosphorylation, whereafter dna incorporation and growth inhibition occurs. however, resistance
to gemcitabine may include other mechanisms like increased activity of
 xxxd1836xxx  deaminase (dcda) and dna polymerase or decreased gemcitabine triphosphate (dfdctp) accumulation. also, rr is reported to be
related to gemcitabine resistance, but in a nonconsistent way. some in vitro
acquired resistance models associate gemcitabine resistance with increased
rr activity,[3,4] others with increased  xxxg1991xxx  expression,[5] , or increased[3] or
decreased  xxxg1992xxx [6] expression. one study suggests that  xxxg1991xxx  expression
is a crucial predictive marker of survival in gemcitabine/cisplatin-treated
non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) patients.[7] although a special r2
protein is induced by p53,[8] this has not yet been related to gemcitabine
resistance. however, no studies have been reported on acquired resistance
in in vivo model systems nor in patients.
we derived cell lines from a previously developed in vivo resistance
model,[9] in which we found an increased  xxxg1991xxx  expression using microarray technology. we isolated cell lines from these tumors that subsequently
were tested for cross-resistance patterns to other drugs, which was not
possible in vivo. next, the cells were analyzed by expression micro-array and
lc-pcr, demonstrating a direct relationship between  xxxg1991xxx  and acquired
resistance to gemcitabine in this cell line as well.
materials and methods
gemcitabine, dfdu, and dfdg were supplied by eli lilly inc.
(indianapolis, in, usa). all other chemicals were of analytical grade and
commercially available.
resistance to gemcitabine was induced by treating colon 26a tumor
bearing mice as described previously.[9] the c 26-a cell line and gemcitabine resistant variant c 26-g were derived from the parent tumor
colon 26a and the gemcitabine resistant tumor colon 26g, respectively,
by mechanical dissociation followed by incubation with dnase/collagenese
and ex vivo monolayer culture. resistance was sustained by weekly 480 nm
gemcitabine for 4 hours.
chemosensitivity, dfdctp pools and enzyme assays were performed as
described previously,[10] and pcr was performed as described before.[9]
micro-array analysis was performed as described before.[9] basically, a mouse
oligolibrary (compugen/sigma-aldrich chemie b.v., zwijndrecht, nl)
representing 7230 separate genes was spotted. after printing the codelink
activated 3d-link slides were processed according to the manufacturers

results
after initial isolation, resistance to gemcitabine and other cytostatics, including deoxynucleoside analogs, was determined in c 26-g cells
(table 1). omission of gemcitabine gradually decreased the resistance
factor (rf) after 72 hours drug treatment from 7.7- to 1.5-fold resistance. no
or moderate cross-resistance was found for the dna-polymerase inhibitor
aphidicolin, the antifolate ly231514 (alimta), the  xxxg611xxx  substrates  xxxd1790xxx 
and cda, and the  xxxd3249xxx   xxxd1709xxx , while marked cross-resistance was
found for the catabolite dfdu and the purine analog dfdg.
initial analysis focussed on deoxynucleoside metabolizing enzymes. no
major differences were found in  xxxg611xxx  and dcda enzyme activity. also,
deoxyguanosine kinase (partially) responsible for dfdg activation was not
changed. only  xxxg2288xxx  (tk2), which poorly phosphorylates
gemcitabine, was substantially decreased in c 26-g cells (table 2).
c 26-g cells accumulated about 2-fold more overall dfdctp after 4and 24-hour exposure to gemcitabine (figure 1). this was surprising,
since we previously observed a significant relationship between gemcitabine
sensitivity and dfdctp accumulation.[12] after incubation in drug free
medium, this dfdctp accumulation was even more pronounced.

culture in the absence of gemcitabine for 9 months reduced the ic50 for gemcitabine in c 26-g
to 7.5 nm; challenging the cell line for 7 weeks weekly for 4 hours to the ic50 for 4 hours, increased
the ic50 (72 hours) to 104 nm. subsequent culture in drug-free medium again reduced the resistance

average enzyme activities ± sem of at least 3 experiments in nmol/hr/106 cells. for measuring
 xxxd1836xxx  ( xxxd1836xxx ) phosphorylation by  xxxg611xxx , assayed at 230 µm  xxxd1836xxx , tk2 was inhibited by

in the micro-array analysis, the average log2 rna expression for  xxxg1992xxx

0.016 and 1.008 ± 0.046 respectively compared to the average of all genes:

all increases were significant as determined by students t-test (p < 0.02).
the 4.5-fold decreased tk2 enzyme activity might be related to the decreased tk2 expression being −0.195 ± 0.146.

discussion
bergman et al.[9] described the first in vivo gemcitabine resistant model,
which was developed by treating mice bearing colon 26a tumors for about
one year. the derived c 26-g cell line was resistant, but to a lesser extent
than cell lines made resistant to gemcitabine.[1,10] although a decrease
in  xxxg611xxx  activity often is linked to acquired resistance to gemcitabine, the
 xxxg611xxx  enzyme activity did not differ between c 26-a and c 26-g. both tk2
expression and enzyme activity were decreased in c 26-g; the relevance is
not clear since gemcitabine is a poor tk2 substrate,[13] while c 26-g cells
had even an increased dfdctp accumulation. however, the decreased tk2
is in line with the cross-resistance for dfdu, which is a good substrate for
tk2.[13]
although c 26-g cells were cross-resistant to dfdg, phosphorylated by
both  xxxg611xxx  and dgk, these enzyme activities were not decreased.
the most striking increase in rna expression in c 26-g cells was
that of  xxxg1991xxx . this also was found in the original colon 26g tumor.[9,14]
however, when gemcitabine treatment of the cell line was omitted, both
resistance and  xxxg1991xxx  expression decreased dramatically, demonstrating a
direct relationship with acquired resistance. a role for  xxxg1991xxx  in intrinsic

resistance to gemcitabine was suggested in patients with metastatic nsclc.
patients with a low pretreatment  xxxg1991xxx  mrna had a significantly longer
median survival than those with a high expression[7] when treated with
a gemcitabine containing regimen. also  xxxg1992xxx  expression, which was
reported to be related to gemcitabine resistance previously,[3] was increased
in the c 26-g cells. since  xxxd1790xxx , in contrast to gemcitabine, can not inhibit
rr, this might explain the only moderate cross-resistance to  xxxd1790xxx  in the c
26-g cells.
the c 26-g cells had increased levels and retention of dfdctp. this
lack of an effect of dfdctp, which is normally associated with gemcitabine
sensivity,[12] might be explained by the molecular sink theory as proposed
by davidson et al.,[5] implicating that at an increased  xxxg1991xxx  expression,
dfdcdp might be trapped in this “sink,” resulting in increased dfdctp
levels.
in conclusion, we isolated a c 26-g cell line derived from a tumor with
in vivo induced gemcitabine resistance. micro-array profiling revealed a
marked increase in  xxxg1991xxx  expression, which is in line with in an acquired
in vitro resistance model,[5] suggesting a key role for acquired in vivo
gemcitabine resistance.
