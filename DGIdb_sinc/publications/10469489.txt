fluorescent indicators are widely used in the measurements of cytosolic calcium in many cell types for
many purposes because they are relatively easy to use.
notwithstanding, they have some defects to prevent
accurate measurements under certain conditions,
such as significant dye leakage and uv-quenching effect.  xxxd2563xxx , a representative quinone derivative
with antiaggregating effect, is also uv-absorbent. to
investigate whether  xxxd2563xxx  can affect the change
of cytosolic calcium in platelets by agonist, we measured the change of cytosolic calcium level using calcium green-1. since this dye has not been used previously in platelets, we determined that the optimal
loading of calcium green-1 to platelets was achieved
using 3 mm dye incubated for 60 min at 37°c. our study
compared the use of calcium green-1 with fura-2 and
fluo-3 (two widely used dyes) in measurements of cytosolic calcium. fura-2 is uv-excited, so when  xxxd2563xxx  was treated in fura-2-loaded cells, it had a
quenching effect. fluo-3, the other visible fluorescent
indicator, leaked from platelets very rapidly and required the use of anion channel blockers which are
known to affect physiological response of platelets.
our study demonstrated that changes in cytosolic calcium levels can be accurately measured without these
problems by using calcium green-1. we therefore were
able to demonstrate that  xxxd2563xxx  inhibited calcium
increase by thrombin in a dose-dependent manner
similar to  xxxd2563xxx ’s antiaggregating effect in platelets. © 1999 academic press

opment, muscle contraction, hormone secretion, metabolism, neuronal excitability, and proliferation (1).
for example, in platelets, the increase of cytosolic calcium plays major roles in regulating important cellular
functions such as aggregation, activation of cytosolic
enzymes, and secretion of physiologic factors from
granules (2). in the resting state, cytosolic calcium in
platelets is 1000 –10,000 times less than that in organelles or extracellular compartments, but when the
cells are activated by agonists such as thrombin, concentrations of cytosolic calcium can increase dramatically. assessing these changes in calcium concentration requires a dependable and accurate methodology.
fluorescent dyes are the most widely used method to
measure changes in cytosolic calcium levels. this is
because fluorescent dyes have certain advantages over
other techniques, including relatively easy loading of
cells with dye, relatively low signal-to-noise (s/n) ratio,
and accurate calibration. but a number of problems
with fluorescent dyes have also been reported: the dyes
perturb cellular physiology or compartmentalize the
calcium into organelles; the dye can leak significantly
through anion channels (3) and bind to extracellular
calcium, thereby resulting in inaccurately high measurements of cytosolic calcium (4), unless organic anion
channel blockers (e.g.,  xxxd3256xxx , probenecid) are
used (5–7).
the literature includes reports of the following fluorescent dyes being used: quin-2, fura-2, indo-1, fluo-3
(8 –10). indo-1 and fura-2 are perhaps the most widely
used because they are ratiometric indicators using
dual wavelengths and they calibrate accurately (11).
however, these dyes are uv-excitable and therefore
not appropriate for use in investigations involving uvabsorbing (300 – 450 nm) substances, such as phenol
and quinone derivatives.
to overcome this problem, a fluorescent dye that is
excited in the visible light range (over 450 nm), fluo-3,
was used. but in platelets, fluo-3 leaked severely and

calcium green-1 to measure cytosolic calcium in platelets

measurement was possible only with the anion-channel blocker, probenecid (10), which itself can sometimes affect cellular physiology. for example, in platelets, probenecid was shown to inhibit aggregation (12,
13). therefore, when investigating effects of chemicals
on calcium regulation in platelets, a different dye is
required to accurately measure cytosolic calcium.
some other dyes which are excited in the visible light
range include calcium green, calcium crimson, and calcium orange. among these, calcium green-1 is reported
to fluoresce the most intensely when it binds to calcium
and, in fact, calcium green-1 has a greater binding
affinity with calcium than even fluo-3 (14), making this
dye indicator very sensitive to changes in calcium.
calcium green-1 has been used previously to measure calcium in neuron cells (15, 16) and calcium waves
in xenopus oocytes (17). this paper reports on its use
for measuring cytosolic calcium in platelets following
treatment of a platelet aggregating agonist (thrombin)
and a uv-absorbing antiaggregating chemical ( xxxd2563xxx ).
materials and methods

blood was collected into 15% (v/v) acid– citrate– dextrose anticoagulant (85 mm trisodium citrate, 71 mm
 xxxd1710xxx , 111 mm dextrose) from the abdominal aorta
under light ether anesthesia using 18-gauge needles to
prevent hemolysis. collected blood was centrifuged for

kh 2po 4, 0.8 mm mgcl 2, 10 mm hepes, 5.6 mm dextrose, 10% acid– citrate– dextrose, 0.35% bsa, ph 7.4)
and centrifuged for 10 min at 500g. the platelet pellets
were finally suspended in hepes–tyrodes buffer (138
mm nacl, 2.8 mm kcl, 0.8 mm kh 2po 4, 0.8 mm

ph 7.4). the cell number of washed platelets (wp) was
adjusted to 3 3 10 8 cells/ml using a hemacytometer to
reflect physiological conditions.
measurement of platelet aggregation
platelet aggregation was measured using a lumiaggregometer (chronolog corp., havertown, pa) by turbidometric method, with 0% aggregation calibrated as
the absorbance of wp and 100% aggregation calibrated
as the absorbance of suspension buffer. wp in a siliconcoated cuvette was stirred at 1200 rpm for 1 min to
stabilize the baseline, and platelet aggregation was
induced by addition of thrombin. turbidity change was
measured for 3 min. to measure the antiaggregating
effect of  xxxd2563xxx , wp in a silicon-coated cuvette was
stirred at 1200 rpm for 1 min, incubated with  xxxd2563xxx  for 5 min, and then treated with thrombin (0.1
u/ml). dmso was used as the vehicle for  xxxd2563xxx ,
such that the final concentration of dmso in the cuvette medium was 0.5%. this concentration has been
shown to have no effect on platelet aggregation and
cytotoxicity (18).

solutions of various dyes (5 mm fura-2/am, 3 mm
fluo-3/am, and 3 mm calcium green-1/am) in 20% pluronic f-127 in dmso were prepared. each dye solution
was then diluted 1000-fold with loading buffer (137

platelets were washed with washing buffer and then
centrifuged for 10 min at 500g. pellets were suspended
in loading buffer containing one of the fluorescent dyes
and incubated for 45 min (for fura-2 and fluo-3) or for
various time periods (for calcium green-1). after incubation, the platelets were centrifuged for 10 min at
500g and pellets were resuspended with hepes–tyrodes buffer. the cell number of platelets was adjusted
to 3 3 10 8 cells/ml using a hemacytometer under light

measurement of fluorescence spectrum change by
 xxxd2563xxx  using fura-2 and calcium green-1. platelets loaded with either fluorescent dye were stirred
continuously at 37°c in a fluorimeter cuvette (starna
cell inc., atascadero, ca). dye-loaded platelets were
then lysed with 50 mg/ml digitonin. dmso vehicle or
60 mm  xxxd2563xxx  vehicle was then added to the cuvette. after 3 min incubation, the fluorescence spectrum was measured using a rf-5000 spectrofluorimeter (shimadzu, japan). to measure the excitation
spectrum of fura-2, the emission wavelength of the
fluorimeter was fixed at 510 nm and the excitation
range was scanned at 300 – 400 nm. to measure excitation of calcium green-1, the emission wavelength of
the fluorimeter was fixed at 533 nm and the excitation
range was scanned at 450 –550 nm.

thrombin treatment. calcium green-1-loaded platelets in a fluorimeter cuvette were preincubated for 1
min and then pretreated with 60 mm  xxxd2563xxx  or
dmso for 5 min. platelet aggregation was induced by
addition of thrombin (0.1 u/ml) and then measured for
3 min at the excitation wavelength (506 nm) and the
emission wavelength (533 nm). the fluorimeter was
calibrated as follows: washed platelets containing 1
mm calcium were treated with 4 mm egta and 30 mm
tris to chelate extracellular calcium. after lysing the
platelets with digitonin, the fluorescence intensity was
measured as f min.  xxxg2125xxx  2 (4 mm) was then added to the
cuvette and fluorescence intensity was measured as
f max. cytosolic calcium concentration was calculated by
the following equation:

k d 5 190 nm.

the measurement of dye leakage from platelets using
fluo-3 and calcium green-1. dye leakage was measured as previously described (9). washed platelets
loaded with either fluo-3 or calcium green-1 were incubated for 10 min. change in fluorescence intensity
before and after incubation was determined with the
excitation wavelength fixed at 506 nm and the emission wavelength fixed at 533 nm for calcium green-1
and with the excitation wavelength at 488 nm and the
emission wavelength at 525 nm for fluo-3, respectively.
following incubation, platelets were lysed with 50
mg/ml digitonin to release all the fluorescent dye from
the cytosol. increase in fluorescence intensity was
again measured. the extent of dye leakage was calculated as the percentage of the change in fluorescence
intensity during the 10-min incubation over the change
in fluorescence observed after digitonin-induced platelet lysis.

nm and emission at 533 nm using a fluorimeter. data represent

results and discussion

to determine the appropriate conditions to optimize
loading of calcium green-1 in platelets, we examined
the influence of dye concentration, temperature, and
loading time on the extent of fluorescence intensity at
the excitation wavelength (506 nm) and the emission
wavelength (533 nm). figure 1 shows the effect of
calcium green-1 concentration and temperature on fluorescence intensity in cells incubated for 60 min. at
25°c, fluorescence increased in a dose-dependent manner. at 37°c, fluorescence intensity was maximal at 3
mm and then plateaued. there was little difference in
the maximal fluorescence observed at concentrations of
3 mm and higher incubated at 37°c and 7 mm and
higher incubated at 25°c. therefore, the optimal concentration of dye loading was 3 mm at 37°c or 7 mm at
25°c. since the dye can act as a calcium buffer and
actually inhibit platelet aggregation (19), it is technically desirable to use the lowest concentration for loading of dye required for optimal fluorescence. based on
this experiment, this was determined to be 3 mm at
37°c.
figure 2 shows the effect of loading time on fluorescence intensity. platelets were incubated with 3 mm
calcium green-1 at 37°c for varying time periods. fluorescence increases in a time-dependent fashion
through a 60-min period of incubation. extending incubation time beyond 60 min results in loss of cell
integrity, as evidenced by significantly reduced platelet
aggregation (data not shown). the results depicted in
figs. 1 and 2 show that optimal loading conditions of

calcium green-1 to platelets are 3 mm calcium green-1
incubated for 60 min at 37°c.
to determine if the response of platelets loaded with
calcium green-1 is similar to that of control platelets
(not loaded with dye), we examined the effects of
thrombin treatment on both types of platelets (fig. 3).
figure 3a shows that there is no difference in aggregation response of control and dye-loaded platelets to
0.1 u/ml thrombin. when thrombin was added to dyeloaded platelets, the increase in cytosolic calcium level
showed a similar response pattern (fig. 3b) to that
seen for aggregation. when fluorescence was calibrated to calcium concentration, the cytosolic calcium
level following exposure to thrombin was 914 6 80 nm.
this value is similar to that reported using fura-2 (19)
in platelets. these results demonstrate that we can
measure cytosolic calcium in platelets using calcium
green-1.
to determine if calcium green-1 can measure cytosolic calcium with minimal dye leakage occurring during
incubation experiments with antiaggregating agents,
we examined the extent of dye leakage from platelets
loaded with calcium green-1 or fluo-3 during a 10-min
incubation. in the absence of an anion channel blocker,
probenecid, fluo-3-loaded platelets demonstrate extensive dye leakage (fig. 4). in contrast, platelets loaded
with calcium green-1 demonstrated less than 10%
leakage at 5 min and 15% leakage within 10 min. since
most experiments investigating platelet antiaggregating effects by chemical agents use less than 5-min
incubations, calcium green-1 loading of platelets seems
appropriate for these investigations and will not necessitate the use of anion channel blockers.

of thrombin (0.1 u/ml). the measurement of cytosolic calcium in

and then platelet aggregation was induced by addition of thrombin
(0.1 u/ml); fluorescence was measured for 3 min at the excitation
wavelength (506 nm) and the emission wavelength (533 nm). calculation of cytosolic calcium levels was described under materials and

the percentage of fluorescence intensity remaining after digitonininduced platelet lysis. figure is representative of three experiments.

fig. 5. effect of  xxxd2563xxx  on fluorescence intensity within each
dye’s excitation spectrum. washed platelets loaded with either
fura-2 (a) or calcium green-1 (b) were stirred continuously at 37°c in
a fluorimeter cuvette. dye-loaded platelets were then lysed with
digitonin. dmso vehicle represented by men(2) or 60 mm  xxxd2563xxx  represented by men(1) was then added to the cuvette. after 3
min incubation, the fluorescence spectrum was measured as described under materials and methods. figure is representative of
three experiments.

although fura-2 is also capable of assessing antiaggregating effects of chemicals on platelets without requiring the presence of anion channel blockers, the dye
is excited at uv wavelengths. therefore, uv-absorbing
chemicals could potentially quench the fluorescence
generated by cytosolic calcium increases. to investigate this premise, we treated lysates of platelets loaded
with fura-2 or calcium green-1 with  xxxd2563xxx  (60
mm), an uv-absorbing antiaggregating agent, to determine if fluorescence quenching would occur (fig. 5). we
have investigated the quenching effect of  xxxd2563xxx  at
wavelength 340 nm (calcium-bound form) and 380 nm
(calcium-unbound form) for fura-2, and 506 nm for
calcium green-1, since an accurate k d value for each
fluorescent dye is available at these wavelengths which
are used in most studies (14). addition of  xxxd2563xxx 
significantly decreased the fluorescence intensity of
calcium-bound form (at 340 nm) as well as calcium
unbound form (at 380 nm) of fura-2, but had little effect
on fluorescence intensity at 506 nm when platelets
were loaded with calcium green-1. this shows that the
fluorescence intensity of calcium green-1 is not affected
at 506 nm by uv-absorbing chemicals such as  xxxd2563xxx .
to determine if the antiaggregating effect of a uvabsorbing compound could be correlated with observed
inhibition of cytosolic calcium increases, the effect of
 xxxd2563xxx  on thrombin-induced platelet aggregation
and corresponding cytosolic calcium changes was in-

vestigated. when  xxxd2563xxx  was preincubated in
platelets for 5 min, thrombin-induced aggregation was
inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner (fig.
6a). under the same conditions, cytosolic calcium increases by thrombin were also inhibited in a similar
concentration-dependent manner (fig. 6b). these results confirmed that changes in physiological response
of platelets to uv-absorbing chemical agents could be
measured using calcium green-1 dye.
this study determined the optimal conditions for
loading calcium green-1 to platelets for the first time
and demonstrated that cytosolic calcium changes in
platelets induced by uv-absorbing compounds can be
measured using calcium green-1 dye. these observations are uncomplicated by technical difficulties encountered using other dyes to load platelets, such as
fura-2 and fluo-3. use of calcium green-1 is preferred to
use of fura-2 when studies involve effects of uv-absorbing compounds because calcium green-1 is excited at
higher wavelengths (506 nm) and therefore its fluorescence is not quenched by uv-absorbing chemicals, such
as phenols and quinones.
numerous studies have previously reported changes
in calcium levels in platelets following application of
antiaggregating agents, including uv-absorbing

fig. 6. effects of  xxxd2563xxx  on thrombin-induced aggregation and
calcium increase in platelets. to measure the antiaggregating effect
of  xxxd2563xxx , wp in a silicon-coated cuvette was stirred at 1200 rpm
for 1 min, incubated with various concentration of  xxxd2563xxx  for 5
min, and then treated with thrombin (0.1 u/ml). to measure effect of
 xxxd2563xxx  on cytosolic calcium levels, calcium green-1-loaded platelets in a fluorimeter cuvette were pretreated with  xxxd2563xxx  or
dmso vehicle control for 5 min. after addition of thrombin (0.1
u/ml), fluorescence was measured for 3 min at the excitation wavelength (506 nm) and the emission wavelength (533 nm). calculation
of cytosolic calcium levels was described under materials and methods. figure is representative of three experiments.

calcium green-1 to measure cytosolic calcium in platelets

agents (20, 21). since uv-absorbing agents interfere
with the fluorescence from uv-excitable dyes such as
fura-2 or indo-1; however, accurate measurement of
calcium has not been previously achieved. since the
excitation of calcium green-1 was not affected by uvabsorbing agents like  xxxd2563xxx , our results suggest
that calcium green-1 can be used to determine accurate
changes of cytosolic calcium in the presence of antiaggregating agents quenched by uv-absorbing chemicals.
previous to this investigation, leakage by fluo-3 and
other similar fluorescence dyes in platelets was a significant technical problem that prevented accurate cytosolic calcium measurement for two reasons: (1) the
leaking dye lowered fluorescence intensity for intracellular calcium, and (2) the fluorescent dye released into
medium resulted in significant increased fluorescent
intensity by binding with the calcium in the medium.
cytosolic calcium can therefore only be accurately
measured when fluorescent dye leakage is minimal.
however, it is not feasible to measure cytosolic calcium
using fluo-3 dye in platelets, since all the loaded dyes
were leaked within 10 min (9, 10). our data showed
that about 60% of loaded fluo-3 dye leaks out of platelets within 10 min (fig. 4), a finding similar to previous
studies. to inhibit the dye leakage, organic anion channel blockers such as probenecid have been used with
fluo-3. however, anion channel blockers itself are
known to affect the physiological response of platelets
(13). our results suggested that cytosolic calcium could
be determined using a fluorescent dye (calcium
green-1) without using an anion channel blocker. dye
leakage from calcium green-1-loaded platelets was significantly less than that occurring using fluo-3-loaded
platelets.
in summary, our study demonstrated that calcium
green-1 can be used to measure changes of cytosolic
calcium levels in platelets in the presence of uvabsorbing chemical during a 10-min incubation period.
