cellular pharmacology of mta: a correlation of mta-induced cellular toxicity and in vitro enzyme inhibition with its effect on intracellular folate...  the mechanism of action of an antifolate may be investigated using a variety of experimental methods. these include experiments in a cell culture setting to observe possible protection against drug effects afforded by the end products of metabolic pathways, assessing the activity of purified target enzymes in the presence of the antifolate, and, finally, the measurement of drug effects on intracellular folate and nucleoside triphosphate pools. the current discussion is focused on studies using ccrf-cem leukemia cells that were designed to compare and contrast mechanisms of action of the antifolates methotrexate, which is primarily a  xxxg631xxx  inhibitor,  xxxd3077xxx , a  xxxg2366xxx  inhibitor, ly309887, a  xxxd149xxx  ribonucleotide formyltransferase inhibitor, and mta (multitargeted antifolate), which is a novel antifolate antimetabolite. the results of these studies support the hypothesis that mta affects multiple enzymatic targets and has a distinct mechanism of action from methotrexate,  xxxd3077xxx , and ly309887.
