abstract—a series of n-(p-sulfamoylphenyl)-a-d-glycopyranosylamines was prepared by reaction of sulfanilamide with diﬀerent
monosaccharides in the presence of ammonium chloride. the new compounds were investigated for inhibition of the metalloenzyme carbonic anhydrase (ca,  xxxg287xxx   xxxg293xxx ), involved in aqueous humor secretion within the mammalian eye. isozymes ca i and
ca ii were strongly inhibited by some of these compounds, which showed inhibition constants in the range of 510–1200 nm against
ca i and 10–25 nm against ca ii, similarly to clinically used sulfonamides, such as acetazolamide,  xxxd2592xxx ,  xxxd1872xxx ,  xxxd1931xxx  and  xxxd367xxx . the presence of sugar moieties in these molecules induced an enhanced water solubility
as compared to other sulfonamides. in hypertensive rabbits (a widely used animal model of glaucoma), two of the new compounds
showed strong and long-lasting intraocular pressure (iop) lowering, being more eﬀective than  xxxd1931xxx  and  xxxd367xxx , the
two clinically used, topically acting antiglaucoma sulfonamides with ca inhibitory properties.

1. introduction
although the treatment of glaucoma with inhibitors of
the metallo-enzyme carbonic anhydrase (ca, ec
4.2.1.1) is very eﬀective in reducing elevated intraocular
pressure (iop), the systemic administration of drugs
such as acetazolamide aza,  xxxd2592xxx  mza or
 xxxd1872xxx  dcp leads to unpleasant side eﬀects
due to inhibition of the enzyme present in other tissues
(kidneys,  xxxd187xxx , stomach, etc.) than the eye.1 4 the
possibility of the topical administration of the classical
drugs from this class mentioned above (acetazolamide,
 xxxd2592xxx  or  xxxd1872xxx ) was extensively
investigated by several researchers, but negative results
have been constantly obtained, and for more than 40
years it was considered that ca inhibitors could only be

given sistemically.1 important advances in this ﬁeld
have been then achieved by the merck group, which
discovered the ﬁrst clinically used, topically eﬀective
antiglaucoma sulfonamide,  xxxd1931xxx  dza.5 the
approach for arriving to this compound (and in fact
also to  xxxd367xxx  brz, the second such clinically
used pharmacological agent)6 is known as the ‘ring
approach’, as it involved the exploration of a wide range
of ring systems to which sulfamoyl moieties were
incorporated.2 4 we have explored on the other hand
an alternative approach for the design of topically acting antiglaucoma sulfonamides, which consists in attaching tails that will induce the desired physico-chemical
properties (such as for example water solubility, good
penetrability through the cornea, etc.) to scaﬀolds of
aromatic/heterocyclic sulfonamides also incorporating
derivatizable moieties of the amino/hydroxy type.2 4,7 10
many tails have been used for the design of topically
acting sulfonamide ca inhibitor antiglaucoma agents,

226

such as for example pyridine-carboxamido-, quinolinesulfonylamido-, polyaminopolycarboxamido-, perﬂuoroalkyl/arylcarboxamido/sulfonamido, aminoacyl- or olygopeptidyl among others,2 4,7 10 but no sugar moieties
have been incorporated up to now in such compounds.
due to the highly hydrophilic character of such sugar
moieties, one may expect a good water solubility for
sulfonamides incorporating them, a feature desirable for
topically acting drugs to be administered directly into
the eye. thus, we explored the possibility of synthesizing sugar-containing sulfonamides, prepared a series of
such derivatives possessing a-glycosylamino tails, and
studied their in vitro ca inhibitory properties against
isozymes hca i and hca ii. some of the most eﬀective
ca inhibitors obtained were then investigated in vivo,
in rabbits with high intraocular pressure (iop), in order
to detect compounds useful as topically acting antiglaucoma drugs.

2. chemistry
previous studies have shown that n-p-sulfamoylphenylglucosylamine 2a and n-p-sulfamoylphenylmannosylamine 2c possessed the same antibacterial properties
as the lead compound, sulfanilamide, and were considerably less toxic and better tolerated.11 still, such
compounds have never been investigated for their ca
inhibitory properties. we decided to prepare a series of
n-(p-sulfamoylphenyl)-a-d-glycopyranosylamines and
test them for their interaction with the most abundant
and physiologically relevant ca isozymes,1 4 that is,
hca i and hca ii (scheme 1).
the diﬀerent glycosylamines 2 were prepared by a
method previously described by bognar and nanasi.12
direct condensation of monosaccharides, such as glucose 1a, galactose 1b, mannose 1c, ribose 1d, arabinose
1e, xylose 1f, rhamnose 1g and fucose 1h, with sulfanilamide in 95% ethanol, using ammonium chloride as
catalyst, led to the n-p-sulfamoylphenyl glycosylamine
2a–h in good yields. all compounds were extensively
characterized.13

3. ca inhibition
inhibition data against isozymes hca i and hca ii
with the compounds 2a–h reported here and standard
ca inhibitors, such as acetazolamide,  xxxd2592xxx ,
 xxxd1872xxx ,  xxxd1931xxx ,  xxxd367xxx  and
sulfanilamide, are shown in table 1.16
as seen from data of table 1, the glycosylsulfanilamides
2a–h reported here show a very compact behavior from
the point of view of their ca i and ii inhibitory properties, with all eight derivatives possessing inhibition
constants in a limited range of values, i.e., of 510–1200
nm against hca i, and of 10–25 nm against hca ii.
thus, in contrast to sulfanilamide, these sugar derivatives act as much more eﬃcient inhibitors against both
isozymes. indeed, the parent compound, sulfanilamide,
has a ki value of 28 mm against hca i and of 300 nm
against hca ii, being a weak inhibitor. the sugar derivatives 2a–h are at least an order of magnitude better
ca ii inhibitors as compared to sulfanilamide, but the
table 1. inhibition data for derivatives 2a–h reported in the present
paper and standard sulfonamide ca inhibitors
no.

nature of the sugar moiety, although ﬁne tuning
potency, seems to be less important for the structure–
activity relationship, as all derivatives showed rather
similar potency. one must also mention that all the
sugar derivatives used for the preparation of the new
compounds belonged to the same series, which may
explain these data. derivatives 2a–h showed the same
potency against hca ii as the clinically used sulfonamides
acetazolamide,
 xxxd2592xxx ,
 xxxd1872xxx  and  xxxd1931xxx . only  xxxd367xxx 
behaved as a much stronger ca ii inhibitor. the
potency against ca i of the sugar derivatives 2a–g was
again comparable to that of acetazolamide,  xxxd2592xxx  and  xxxd1872xxx , whereas  xxxd1931xxx 
was a much weaker inhibitor of this isozyme (table 1).

4. topical antiglaucoma activity
two of the best in vitro ca inhibitors investigated here,
2e and 2g have been formulated as 2% water solutions
and administered topically to hypertensive rabbits, a
widely used animal model of glaucoma.2 6 the water
solubility of these derivatives was indeed very good
(data not shown) due to the presence of the hydrophilic
sugar moieties in their molecule. thus, it was easy to
formulate them as eye-drops at neutral ph values, in
contrast to  xxxd1931xxx  and  xxxd367xxx  which are
either not soluble enough at neutral ph and must be
used as a suspension ( xxxd367xxx )6 or must be solubilized as hydrochloride salt ( xxxd1931xxx )5 and as a
consequence, the ph of the solution is rather acidic
(around 5.5). both these properties lead to undesired
side eﬀects of these two antiglaucoma drugs such as
blurred vision, eye redening and irritation, and so on.2 6
in the case of the sugar derivatives 2e and 2g, the presence of the glycosyl tail in their molecule highly
enhanced water solubility at neutral ph, which constitutes a very desirable pharmacological feature for
topically acting antiglaucoma drugs.

(solution, ph 7.0). errors were in the range of 3–5% of the reported
values.

(50 ml) of 2% solution/suspension of inhibitors is
shown in figure 1.17,18 the two standard drugs,  xxxd1931xxx  dza and  xxxd367xxx  brz were also included
in our experiments. it may be seen that both dza and
brz show very similar patterns of iop reduction, the
two drugs being eﬃcient lowering agents (curves 1 and 2
in fig. 1), with a maximal eﬀect (around 6.5–7 mm hg)
achieved at 1 h post-administration, and a return to
basal iop values after 3 h. the two sugar sulfanilamides
investigated here were, on the other hand, much more
eﬀective iop lowering agents as compared to the two
clinically used drugs. thus, the arabinose derivative 2e
was again maximally active after 1 h post-administration, producing an iop lowering of around 10 mm hg.
a potent iop lowering of 6–8 mm hg was then maintained for the next 2–3 h (curve 3 in fig. 1), and pressure returned to basal values after 5 h (data not shown).
the best iop lowering agent was the rhamnose derivative 2g (curve 4 in fig. 1). in this case, the maximal iop
lowering (of around 16 mm hg) has been achieved after

228

j.-y. winum et al. / bioorg. med. chem. lett. 14 (2004) 225–229

2 h post-administration, and this very potent eﬀect was
maintained for the next 5–6 h when pressure returned to
the basal values. thus, the two derivatives investigated
by us showed much more eﬀective iop lowering as
compared to dza and brz: both the magnitude of the
eﬀect as well as its duration of action were very much
augmented, which constitute very desirable properties
for topically acting antiglaucoma drugs. no ocular discomfort or eye irritation of the experimental animals
have been observed after administration of these sugarsulfonamide derivatives.

5. conclusions
a small series of glycosyl-sulfanilamide derivatives was
prepared and assayed as ca inhibitors. all compounds
showed good ca ii and ca i inhibitory properties, and
two of them were very eﬀective topical antiglaucoma
agents in hypertensive rabbits. indeed, the arabinosyland rhamnosyl-sulfanilamide derivatives produced
maximal iop lowering in the range of 10–16 mm hg
after administration directly into the eye, and the duration of action of this eﬀect was much longer as compared to that of the standard drugs  xxxd1931xxx  and
 xxxd367xxx . furthermore, these sugar derivatives are
water soluble at neutral ph, in contrast to the two
clinically used drugs mentioned above, which may lead
to highly reduced side eﬀects after their topical administration within the eye.

a stopped ﬂow variant of the pocker and stone spectrophotometric method (pocker, y.; stone, j. t. biochemistry 1967, 6, 668) has been employed, using an sx.18mvr applied photophysics stopped ﬂow instrument.
adult male new zealand albino rabbits weighing 3–3.5 kg
were used in the experiments (three animals were used for
each inhibitor studied). the experimental procedures
conform to the association for research in vision and
ophthalmology resolution on the use of animals. the

229

rabbits were kept in individual cages with food and water
provided ad libitum. the animals were maintained on a
12 h/12 h light/dark cycle in a temperature controlled
room, at 20–24  c.
18. iop was measured using a tono-pen xl digital instrument (medtronic solan, usa). the pressure readings
were matched with two-point standard pressure measurements at least twice each day using a digilab calibration
veriﬁer. all iop measurements were done by the same
investigator with the same tonometer. one drop of 0.2%
 xxxd300xxx  hydrochloride ( xxxd300xxx , sandoz) diluted
1:1 with saline was instilled in each eye immediately
before each set of pressure measurements. iop was measured three times at each time interval, and the means
reported. iop was measured ﬁrst immediately before drug
administration, then at 30 min after the instillation of the
pharmacological agent, and then each 30 min for a period
of 4–6 h. for all iop experiments drug was administered
to only one eye, leaving the contralateral eye as an
untreated control. the ocular hypotensive activity is
expressed as the average diﬀerence in iop between the
treated and control eye, in this way minimizing the diurnal, seasonal and interindividual variations commonly
observed in the rabbit.
