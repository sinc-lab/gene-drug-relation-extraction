abstract
the hema gene encoding  xxxd148xxx  synthase (alas) was cloned from the genomic dna of photosynthetic bacterium rhodopseudomonas palustris kugb306. the deduced protein (alas) of this gene contained 409 amino acids. the hema
gene was subcloned into an expression vector pgex-kg and the encoded protein was overexpressed as a fusion protein with
glutathione-s-transferase (gst) in escherichia coli bl21. the recombinant alas was puriﬁed and isolated free of the fusion
partner (gst) by aﬃnity puriﬁcation on glutathione-sepharose 4b resin and cleavage of the puriﬁed fusion protein by thrombin
protease. the optimum ph and temperature of the recombinant alas was found to be at ph 7.5–8.0 and 35–40 °c, respectively.
the km value of the enzyme was 2.01 mm for glycine and 49.55 lm for succinyl-coa. the enzyme activity was strongly inhibited by
pb2þ , fe2þ , co2þ , cu2þ , and zn2þ at 1 mm, but slightly aﬀected by mg2þ and kþ . the recombinant alas required pyridoxal 50 phosphate (plp) as a cofactor for catalysis. removal of this cofactor led to complete loss of the activity. ultraviolet–visible
spectroscopy with the alas suggested the presence of an aldimine linkage between the enzyme and plp.

1. introduction
 xxxd148xxx  (ala) is a precursor of tetrapyrroles such as heme, porphyrin, chlorophyll, and vitamin b12 , which are synthesized via porphobilinogen,
and is a key metabolic intermediate to regulate the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis [1,2]. recently, ala has received
much attention, because of its potential use as the herbicide, insecticide, antimicrobial drug, and photosensitizer for the photodynamic therapy [3–7]. in mammals,
birds, yeast, some protozoa, and photosynthetic bacteria
which belong to a subgroup of the purple bacteria, ala
is synthesized by  xxxd148xxx  synthase [alas;
succinylcoa: glycine succinyl transferase (decarboxylating),  xxxg122xxx   xxxg123xxx ]. the enzyme catalyzes the condensation of glycine and succinyl-coa to yield ala in

the presence of the cofactor, pyridoxal 50 -phosphate
(plp) [8,9]. the genes encoding alass have been
characterized in several bacteria: rhodobacter capsulatus
[10], agrobacterium radiobacter [11], rhizobium meliloti
[12], bradyrhizobium japonicum [13], rhodobacter sphaeroides [14], and paracoccus denitriﬁcans [15]. however, the gene and the enzyme from rhodopseudomonas
species have not yet been characterized, although the
genes encoding alass from rhodopseudomonas species
have been listed in genbank database (accession nos.
ab015491, bx572597).
previously, we isolated a photosynthetic bacterium
useful for the wastewater treatment [16]. the strain was
found to be closely related to the rhodopseudomonas
subgroup of purple non-sulfur bacteria, based on its
morphology, phototrophic properties, physiological
properties, quinone component, and fatty acid composition. the phylogenetic analysis of the strain by its 16s
rrna gene sequence also supported the phenotypic

ﬁndings, indicating the isolate was closely related to
rhodopseudomonas palustris. therefore, we designated
the isolated bacterium as ‘‘rhodopseudomonas palustris
kugb306’’. in order to improve this strain for its use
for the overproduction of ala from organic wastes, the
cloning of the gene encoding alas from the strain was
needed. in this study, we report herein the cloning and
sequence analysis of the hema gene encoding alas
from r. palustris kugb306, and the properties of the
recombinant enzyme expressed in escherichia coli were
characterized.

2. materials and methods
2.1. bacterial strains, plasmids, and growth conditions
the culture conditions for r. palustris kugb306
have been described previously [16]. e. coli dh5a was
used as the host for the recombinant plasmids. e. coli
bl21 and pgex-kg [17] were used as the expression
host and plasmid, respectively. e. coli strains harboring
plasmids were grown at 37 ° c in luria–bertani (lb)
medium [18] containing ampicillin (100 lg ml1 ).
2.2. general recombinant dna techniques
the genomic dna from r. palustris kugb306 was
isolated using qiagen genomic-tip (qiagen, hilden,
germany). plasmid dna was puriﬁed from e. coli
strains using high pure plasmid isolation kit (roche,
penzberg, germany). dna fragments were recovered
from agarose gels with the wizardò sv gel and pcr
clean-up system (promega, madison, wi, usa).
southern blotting and other general dna manipulation
procedures were carried out as described by sambrook
et al. [18]. for hybridization, the non-radioactively labeled method was used. the digoxigenin (dig)-labeled
nucleotide and the dig luminescent detection kit were
purchased from roche molecular biochemicals
(mannheim, germany) and used according to the
manufacturer’s instruction.

followed by 25 cycles of ampliﬁcation (95 °c for 30 s, 58
°c for 30 s, and 72 °c for 40 s), and an additional extension step at 72 °c for 7 min. the ampliﬁed fragment
of 843-bp was analyzed by gel electrophoresis and puriﬁed, then cloned into the pgem-t easy vector (promega), and its nucleotide sequence was determined. this
fragment was labeled with dig-dutp and used as a
probe in the southern-blot hybridization. the genomic
dna prepared from r. palustris kugb306 was digested with various restriction enzymes, transferred to a
hybond-nþ membrane (amersham pharmacia biotech,
uppsala, sweden), and hybridized with the dig-labeled
843-bp dna fragment.
to obtain the entire hema gene, an inverse pcr was
performed. genomic dna of r. palustris kugb306
was digested with restriction enzyme psti. the restriction enzyme was then thermally inactivated (65 °c, 20
min), and the cut dna incubated with t4 dna ligase
(takara, tokyo, japan) overnight at 16 °c. the resulting self-ligated dna was precipitated with ethanol
and resuspended in sterile distilled water. this was used
as the template in pcr with 50 primer (50 -cga gtt
 xxxg889xxx  gtt gag cgc gtc-30 ) and 30 primer (50 -tcg
acc tgg gag cgt gaa cg-30 ) oriented in inverted tail-to-tail direction and designed according to
the known nucleotide sequence (probe sequence). pcr
ampliﬁcation was carried out under the following conditions; an initial denaturation at 95 °c for 4 min followed by 30 cycles of ampliﬁcation (95 °c for 30 s, 59 °c
for 30 s, and 72 °c for 4 min), and an additional extension step at 72 °c for 7 min. the ampliﬁed pcr
product was cloned into the pgem-t easy vector
(promega), and its nucleotide sequence was determined.
2.4. dna sequencing and data analysis
dna was sequenced by an abi prism 310 dna
sequencer (perkin–elmer applied biosystems, foster
city, ca, usa). the nucleotide and amino acid sequences were analyzed by using the genetyx-win
program, version 5.1 (software development co., ltd.,
tokyo, japan), and fasta and blast on the ddbj/
genbank/embl nucleotide sequence databases.

2.3. cloning of the hema gene from r. palustris kugb306
2.5. plasmid construction for overexpression in e. coli
two degenerate oligonucleotide primers were synthesized to amplify part of the hema gene: 50 primer was
50 -nac nmg naa yat hgc-30 and 30 primer was
50 -gtn  xxxg874xxx  tar ttd atn gg-30 (n, m, y, h, r,
and d represent a/g/c/t, a/c, c/t, a/t/c, a/g, and
g/a/t, respectively). the two primers were designed
based on the conserved regions of alass from various
microorganisms. genomic dna of r. palustris
kugb306 was used as the template. polymerase chain
reaction (pcr) was carried out under the following
conditions; an initial denaturation at 95 °c for 4 min

the complete coding sequence for alas was ampliﬁed by pcr using cloned pfu dna polymerase (stratagene, la jolla, ca, usa). genomic dna of r. palustris
kugb306 was used as the template. the 50 primer 50 cgg gat cca tgg att aca cca agt tct
tcg-30 and the 30 primer 50 -cgg aat tct cgg ttg
aac tta ttc cgc ag-30 contained the underlined
bamhi and ecori restriction site. the pcr was carried
out as follows; an initial denaturation at 95 °c for 1 min
followed by 25 cycles of ampliﬁcation (95 °c for 45 s, 50

h.-p. choi et al. / fems microbiology letters 236 (2004) 175–181

°c for 45 s, and 72 °c for 2.5 min) and an additional extension step at 72 °c for 10 min. the ampliﬁed pcr
product was digested with these two enzymes, separated
by agarose gel electrophoresis, and then puriﬁed from the
gel. the dna fragment of approximately 1.23-kb containing the alas structural gene was cloned downstream
of the tac promoter of bamhi–ecori-treated pgexkg. the constructed plasmid was designated as
pgex-hema.
2.6. expression and puriﬁcation of the hema gene
e. coli bl21 transformed with pgex-hema was used
to inoculate 400 ml of lb medium containing ampicillin
(100 lg ml1 ). after incubation for 2 h at 37 °c, isopropyl-b-d -thiogalactopyranoside (iptg) was added at
the ﬁnal concentration of 0.5 mm, and the mixture was
incubated for 4 h at 25 °c. cells were harvested by
centrifugation, resuspended in phosphate-buﬀered saline
(pbs; 140 mm nacl, 2.7 mm kcl, 10 mm na2 hpo4 ,
1.8 mm kh2 po4 , ph 7.3) at the ratio of 102 of the
culture volume, and lysed by sonication. triton x-100
(10%) was added at the ﬁnal concentration of 1%, and
mixed gently for 30 min to facilitate the solubilization of
the fusion protein. supernatants were recovered by
centrifugation at 15,000g for 15 min at 4 °c. glutathione-sepharose 4b resin (amersham pharmacia biotech)
was added to the supernatants and mixed gently for 1 h
at 4 °c, followed by a brief centrifugation at 500g for 3
min at 4 °c to remove the supernatants. after extensive
washing of the resin with pbs, alas protein was released from the resin by the proteolytic cleavage of the
fusion protein with biotinylated thrombin protease according to the manufacturer’s instruction (novagen,
madison, wi, usa). to remove thrombin from
the alas protein solution, the thrombin cleavage
capture kit was used according to the manufacturer’s
instruction (novagen).
2.7. gel electrophoresis and the determination of protein
concentration
 xxxd3215xxx –polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds–page) (10%) was performed as described by laemmli [19]. protein concentrations were
determined by the method of bradford [20] with bovine
 xxxg124xxx  as the standard.
2.8. assay for enzyme activity
alas activity was assayed based on the method of
lien and beattie [21]. the assays were terminated by the
addition of trichloroacetic acid. after reaction with
acetylacetone, ala formation was measured as a pyrrole that is detected quantitatively using ehrlich’s reagent by measuring color development at 556 nm. the

177

enzyme assays were performed in the ﬁnal volume of 100
ll containing 50 mm tris–hcl buﬀer (ph 7.5), 5 mm
glycine, 1 mm succinyl-coa, 0.5 mm plp, and 1 lg
alas. one unit of alas was deﬁned as the amount of
enzyme required to catalyze the formation of 1 lmol
ala per 30 min.
2.9. enzyme properties
the enzymatic reaction was assayed in 50 mm tris–
hcl buﬀer at various phs and temperatures. the eﬀects
of various metal ions on the enzyme activity were also
measured in 50 mm tris–hcl buﬀer. after incubation
of the enzyme solution containing metal ions (1 mm) at
4 °c for 30 min, the remaining enzyme activity was
measured under the standard conditions. ultraviolet–
visible spectroscopic measurements of alas interaction
with plp were performed in the range 230–500 nm. all
measurements were made on 0.1 mg ml1 alas in 20
mm tris–hcl buﬀer (ph 7.5). as required, plp, glycine
and succinyl-coa were added and incubated for 5 min
at 37 °c. diﬀerent concentrations of glycine or succinylcoa were used to examine the relationship between the
initial velocity and the substrate concentration. km and
vmax values of the puriﬁed alas were determined by
double-reciprocal plot according to the lineweaver–
burk equation [22].
2.10. nucleotide sequence accession number
the nucleotide sequence of hema gene has been deposited in the genbank under the accession no.
ay489557.

3. results and discussion
3.1. cloning of the hema gene
partial sequence of the hema structural gene in the
genomic dna of r. palustris kugb306 was ampliﬁed
by pcr. the ampliﬁed fragment (843-bp) was dig-labeled and used as a probe for southern-blot hybridization. approximately 4.0-kb dna fragments with a
positive signal were separated from the genomic dna
digested with psti by agarose gel electrophrosis. based
on southern blots, an inverse pcr was performed to
obtain the entire hema gene (fig. 1). self-ligated circular
dna derived from psti-digested genomic dna was
used as a template to amplify an approximately 3.5-kb
fragment, which was also cloned and sequenced. to
conﬁrm whether the sequence obtained from the inverse
pcr reactions and sequencing was correctly deduced, a
1698-bp dna fragment, including 233-bp of the region
upstream of the putative initiator atg and 235-bp of
the region downstream of the stop codon, was ampliﬁed

178

the deduced amino acid sequence showed 57.8% sequence identity with alas from r. palustris no. 7
(genebank accession no. ab015491) and 58.3% sequence identity with alas from r. palustris cga009
(genebank accession no. bx572597).
3.3. expression and puriﬁcation of the recombinant alas
in e. coli

fig. 1. schematic of inverse pcr. genomic dna was digested with
psti that produced a fragment (among others) carrying the known
dna (light shading; whose sequence was identical to 843-bp probe
sequence), as determined by southern blotting. the dna fragments
were circularized by ligation, and speciﬁc sequence primers, designed
to extend outward from the known sequence, were used to amplify
unknown sequences (dark shading) adjacent to the region of known
sequence. the speciﬁc sequence primers were described in section 2.

by pcr as a continuous fragment using genomic dna
as a template and sequenced.
3.2. nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence
the nucleotide sequence of the 1698-bp dna fragment was determined for both strands. portions of the
nucleotide sequence of the sense strand and the deduced
amino acid sequence are shown in fig. 2. one open
reading frame (orf) was located between nucleotides 1
and 1230, and its molar g + c content was 65.24%. the
1230-bp orf had a putative atg start codon 9 bp
downstream from a potential ribosome binding site
(14 gcagg10 ). potential )35 and )10 promoter sequences were observed, as was a stem-loop structure
downstream from the stop codon at position 1228. the
orf encoded a protein of 409 amino acid residues, with
a deduced molecular mass of about 45-kda. a lysine
residue [23,24] involved in the schiﬀ base linkage with
the plp cofactor was observed, as was a glycine-loop
motif [24,25] involved in plp binding. sequence alignment with other alas proteins [24] indicated the
presence of the lysine residue and the glycine-loop motif.

to study the function of the hema gene, it is necessary to obtain an adequate amount of alas protein.
genetically fused aﬃnity fusion partners are widely used
to express recombinant proteins in e. coli, because fusion partners with high aﬃnity for a speciﬁc ligand make
it much more easy to purify fusion protein from hundreds of proteins. in expression levels and solubility of
fusion proteins, gst fusion expression system seemed
to be better than hexahistidine fusion system [26].
therefore, the hema gene was subcloned into pgexkg to generate plasmid pgex-hema, and then, it was
introduced into bl21 for high-level expression as fusion
protein with gst under the control of the tac promoter.
after induction with iptg,  xxxd2051xxx -kda protein (gstalas fusion protein; 26-kda gst + 45-kda alas)
band from the cell-free extracts of bl21/pgex-hema
was seen on sds–page, whereas no 71-kda protein
band from the cell-free extracts of bl21/pgex-kg as
control was shown on sds–page (fig. 3, lane 2 and 3).
from the cell-free extracts of bl21/pgex-kg, a 26kda gst band was seen. the result indicated that the
hema gene was highly expressed as fusion protein with
gst in e. coli. the gst-alas fusion protein was
puriﬁed by binding to glutathione-sepharose 4b resin
and the free alas protein was released from the fusion
protein still bound to the resin by cleavage with
thrombin protease. the free alas protein was still not
suﬃciently pure and contaminated with thrombin protease. therefore, the partially puriﬁed free alas protein was further puriﬁed using thrombin cleavage
capture kit. the puriﬁed alas protein was then analyzed by sds–page gel to determine the purity of the
protein preparation (fig. 3, lane 4). the alas protein
was puriﬁed 13.3-fold from the cell-free extracts with
enzyme speciﬁc activity of 27.73 u mg1 . nearly 2 mg of
the puriﬁed protein was obtained per liter of induced
culture. this yield is lower than that reported for recombinant r. sphaeroides alas (5–7 mg) [27], but the
speciﬁc activity of the puriﬁed alas is higher than that
reported for the recombinant r. sphaeroides alas (13
u mg1 ).
3.4. properties of the recombinant alas
the eﬀect of temperature on the activity of recombinant alas was determined in 50 mm tris–hcl

fig. 2. nucleotide sequence of the hema gene from r. palustris kugb306. the deduced amino acid sequence is shown below the nucleotide sequence. a putative promoter region ()10 and )35), a shine-dalgarno (sd) sequence, and a q-independent terminator (underlined italic letters) are
indicated. the lysine residue involved in the schiﬀ base linkage with the plp cofactor is typed in bold face and boxed. the glycine-loop motif
involved in plp binding is boxed and the glycine residues are identiﬁed with underline. the nucleotide sequence of the hema gene has been deposited
in the genbank under the accession no. ay489557.

buﬀer ph 7.5. the optimum temperature of the recombinant alas was 35–40 °c. the enzyme retained
about 80% of its activity at 50 °c. the optimum ph of
the recombinant alas was 7.5–8.0, which was similar
to that of native alas puriﬁed from r. sphaeroides [28].
the recombinant alas was stable in the alkaline ph
range; approximately 80% of its activity was retained at
ph 9.0.
the eﬀects of various metal ions at 1 mm concentration on the activity of recombinant alas were also
examined: as shown in fig. 4, increasing amount of
inhibitions is seen in the order of mg2þ < kþ < fe3þ <
mn2þ < pb2þ < fe2þ . while co2þ inhibited over 90% of
the activity, cu2þ and zn2þ inhibited completely.
burnham [28] previously reported that metal ions, par-

ticularly fe2þ and cu2þ , are potent inhibitors of alas
puriﬁed from r. sphaeroides.
the presence of plp was found to be essential for the
activity of recombinant alas. removal of the plp led
to complete loss of the activity. the ultraviolet–visible
spectrum obtained when the recombinant alas was
incubated with plp is shown in fig. 5. pure apo-alas
(plp free) showed an absorbance maximum at 280 nm
whereas on incubation with 100 lm plp a second
maximum appeared at 415 nm. this pattern of absorbance is typical of an internal aldimine linkage between
the aldehyde group of the cofactor and an amino group
of the protein [29]. incubation of holo-alas with 1
mm glycine resulted in the shift of the aldimine peak to
412 nm (data not shown). this can be attributed to the

formation of an external aldimine linkage between glycine and plp [30]. the same eﬀect has been noted with
recombinant r. sphaeroides alas [27]. the addition of
0.5 mm succinyl-coa to the alas-plp-glycine complex resulted in no further shift in the absorbance
maximum.
the kinetic parameters were determined for glycine
and succinyl-coa. the km value for glycine and succinyl-coa was 2.01 mm and 49.55 lm, respectively.
previously, the km value for the recombinant r. sph-

the ultraviolet–visible spectrum of apo-alas (solid line) and holoalas (dotted line) were compared over the range 260–500 nm. the
apo-alas had an absorption maximum at 280 nm whereas the holoalas contained an additional maximum at 415 nm which consistent
with plp bound through a aldimine linkage to the enzyme.

aeroides alas has been reported as 1.88 mm for glycine and 17 lm for succinyl-coa [27].
in conclusion, we have cloned and analyzed the
complete sequence of the hema gene encoding alas
from r. palustris kugb306. the deduced amino acid
sequence showed 57.8% sequence identity with alas
from r. palustris no. 7 and 58.3% sequence identity with
alas from r. palustris cga009. the alas from r.
palustris kugb306 was expressed as a catalytically active enzyme, puriﬁed, and some of the enzyme properties
were characterized. these results represent the ﬁrst step
needed for the development of a genetically engineered
r. palustris kugb306 for the overproduction of ala
from organic wastes.
