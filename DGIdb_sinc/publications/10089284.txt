identification of mutations causing 6-pyruvoyl- tetrahydrobiopterin synthase deficiency in polish patients with variant hyperphenylalaninemia.  6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydrobiopterin synthase (ptps) is required for biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin, the cofactor of various enzymes including the hepatic  xxxg1660xxx . mutations in the pts gene result in a variant type of hyperphenylalaninemia, requiring cofactor replacement therapy for treatment.
