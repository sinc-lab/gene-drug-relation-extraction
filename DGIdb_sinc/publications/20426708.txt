expert opinion

importance of the field: androgenetic alopecia affects up to 80% of males
by the age of 80. the synonym ‘male-pattern hair loss’ highlights the fact
that hair loss occurs in a defined and reproducible pattern. hair loss results
in reduced self esteem, loss of confidence and anxiety in affected men. an
effective treatment for hair baldness would be desirable.
areas covered in this review: in androgenetic alopecia, hair follicles undergo
progressive miniaturization. genetic factors and androgens play a major role
in the pathogenesis of the disease. polymorphism of the  xxxg183xxx 
gene was first identified in association with androgenetic alopecia. identification of new susceptibility genes on chromosomes 3q26 and 20p11 suggest
that non-androgen-dependent pathways also are involved.
what the reader will gain: topical monoxidil and oral finasteride are commonly in use and have fda approval for the treatment of male androgenetic
alopecia; dutasteride, a type i and ii 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, is on hold
in phase iii trials. a combination of medical treatment and hair transplant
surgery has shown superior efficacy.
take-home message: androgenetic alopecia is a progressive condition and
although the current available treatments are effective in arresting the progression of the disease, they allow only partial regrowth of hair at its best.
early treatment achieves the best desirable outcome.

introduction

androgenetic alopecia (aga), or male-pattern hair loss (mphl), is a genetically
determined progressive process that causes a gradual conversion of terminal hair
into vellus hair. the prevalence increases with advancing age; however, the age of
onset and rate of progression are variable [1].
the morbidity of mphl is predominantly psychological and varies from person
to person. affected men find themselves less attractive and older looking than nonbalding men [2]. a study found that women and non-balding men have a negative
perception towards bald men and that this is more or less the same as the negative
perception bald men have of themselves [3].
minoxidil lotion and finasteride tablets are both fda approved for the treatment
of hair loss. finasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase type ii inhibitor that reduces conversion of testosterone to the more bioactive metabolite dihydrotestosterone (dht).
dutasteride is a dual type i and type ii 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor and has shown
superior efficacy to finasteride in phase ii trials; however, phase iii trial data are
lacking. these agents are effective at arresting hair loss but are able to achieve
only limited hair regrowth. they are most useful in the management of early
androgenetic alopecia.
hair transplant remains the only viable treatment for advanced hair loss, but this
requires donor occipital hairs. newer agents such as prostaglandin analogues, gene
therapy and angiogenic growth factors have not been shown to have a place in
patient management but are targets for future research.

androgenetic alopecia occurs in the presence of
androgens in genetically susceptible individuals. the
disease onset and progression vary from person
to person.
even though the disease is medically benign hair loss
causes psychological morbidity in majority of the
affected men.
 xxxg183xxx  gene polymorphism plays a major
role in the pathogenesis of androgenetic alopecia. the
identification of new susceptibility genes on
chromosomes 3q26 and 20p11 suggests a yet-to-be
identified androgen-independent pathway.
effective and safe medications are available for the
treatment of androgenetic alopecia and prolonged
continuous use is required for sustained effect.

this box summarizes key points contained in the article.

pathophysiology

in androgenetic alopecia, large terminal hairs are shed and are
replaced by small vellus hairs. three areas of the scalp are
affected preferentially: temples, vertex scalp and mid-frontal
scalp (figure 1). within these areas, the process is strictly patterned. bitemporal hair loss starts at the anterior hair line and
moves posteriorly over the scalp. hair loss over the vertex scalp
begins centrally and radiates outwards circumferentially. over
the mid-frontal scalp, hair follicle miniaturization leads to a
pattern of hair loss reminiscent of a christmas tree [4].
as the three zones are not affected equally, there are clinical
variations in the pattern of hair loss, with some men balding
more to the front and others more over the crown. asian
men tend to develop diffuse thinning over the mid-frontal
zone with the frontal hair line, temples and vertex only minimally affected [5]. this produces a pattern reminiscent of that
described in women by ludwig [6].
the volume of the dermal papilla is directly related to the
size of the emerging hair fibre [7]. miniaturization involves
reduction in the volume of the dermal papilla and this is
due to both a reduction in the extracellular matrix and the
total number of cells [8]. cells are thought to travel out of
the dermal papilla and into the dermal sheath during catagen,
and to re-enter the dermal papilla from the dermal sheath
during anagen [9]. a net reduction in the number of cells reentering the dermal papilla will result in miniaturization.
the factors that regulate cell traffic into and out of the dermal
papilla are poorly understood.
although miniaturized hairs are also seen in alopecia areata,
that condition is potentially fully reversible. by contrast,
androgenetic alopoeica is only partially reversible at its
best [10]. early treatment is associated with superior regrowth
of hair in androgenetic alopecia [11]. the mechanism for difference of regrowth of hair in these two conditions is poorly
understood, but preliminary data suggest a role for the arrector
pili muscle. horizontal scalp biopsy sections stained with
1296

van giessen stain have been used to reconstruct the arrector
pili muscle in three dimensions in relation to the hair
follicle [12]. connection of the arrector pili muscle and the
hair follicle is preserved in alopecia areata but is lost in androgenetic alopecia [12]. interaction between the mesenchymal
muscle cells and the epithelial stem cells in the bulge could
be a requirement for reversal of miniaturization.
hair cycle dynamics
hair is lost and replaced cyclically. follicles undergo corresponding cyclical phases of growth, involution, quiescence
and regeneration. the growth phase (anagen) last for 3 -5 years. as hair elongation is relatively constant at 1 cm per
month, the duration of the growth phase is the primary determinant of the final hair length. at the end of anagen, the involutional phase is known as catagen; this lasts for few weeks.
the period of hair follicle quiescence that follows catagenm,
lasting approximately 3 months, is known as telogen [13].
hair follicle regeneration occurs in the first week or so of anagen and, once regenerated, the anagen phase continues until
the hair reaches its final (possibly predetermined) length.
a number of molecular signals including growth factors,
nuclear receptors, cytokines and intracellular signalling pathways are involved in controlling the hair cycle. growth factors
such as insulin-like growth factor (igf-1), hepatocyte growth
factor, keratinocyte growth factor and vascular endothelial
growth factor (vegf) promote the anagen phase of the hair
cycle [14]. in addition to the hair follicle miniaturization that
results in thin fibres in androgenetic alopecia, a reduction in
anagen duration leads to shorter hair length, while an increase
in telogen duration delays regeneration. this results in hairs
so short and fine that they fail to achieve sufficient length to
reach the surface of the scalp, resulting in increased number
of empty pores [15].
2.1

genetics in androgenetic alopecia
androgenetic alopecia is familial. twin studies identified
heredity as accounting for around 80% of the predisposition
to baldness [16]. polygenic inheritance best accounts for the
range of clinical phenotypes and increased risk with increased
number of affected family members [17]. ellis et al. observed
that the fathers of 81.5% of affected men have baldness
that is higher than that that can be explained by autosomal
dominant inheritance [18].
polymorphism of the  xxxg183xxx  (ar) gene was first
identified in association with androgenetic alopecia [19], and
has subsequently been confirmed by numerous other investigators in different patient cohorts. functional confirmation
of the importance of the  xxxg183xxx  gene in androgenetic alopecia comes from the recognition that men affected
by  xxxg183xxx , a familial neuromuscular disorder associated with a functional alteration of the  xxxg183xxx ,
have a reduced risk of developing androgenetic alopecia [20].
the observation of ar gene polymorphism in the majority
of non-balding men suggests that other factors are necessary to
2.2

catalyses the conversion of testosterone to estradiol and
diminishes intrafollicular testosterone. there is difference in
expression of aromatase in balding and non balding scalp [24].
yip et al. suggest that the aromatase gene ( xxxg574xxx ) might
predispose to hair loss in women [25]. however, casecontrol studies have failed to demonstrate a difference of the
involvement of aromatase gene in causing andogenetic
alopecia [26].

androgens and androgenetic alopecia
the role of androgen in male-pattern hair loss is well established. american anatomist james hamilton observed that
castrated males did not develop androgenetic alopecia unless
they were treated with testosterone [27]. testosterone is the
main circulating androgen and the tissue effects of androgens
are mediated by biding trough to the intracellular androgen
receptor [28]. evidence that patients with androgen insensitivity syndrome, caused by a mutation in the  xxxg183xxx 
gene, do not go bald suggests that androgenetic alopecia is
induced by the effect of testosterone on the androgen
receptor [29].
in most body sites, hair growth is mediated by 5-alphadihydrotestosterone (dht), a potent metabolite of testosterone that has a several-fold higher sensitivity to the androgen
receptor. the conversion of testosterone to dht is catalysed
by 5-alpha-reductase. there are two isoforms of the enzyme
(type 1 and 2), and both are capable of producing dht
from testosterone, although they have different biochemical
and distinct tissue-specific expression patterns [30]. higher
concentrations of 5-alpha-reductase activity have been
observed in bald scalps.
the important role of 5-alpha-reductase activity in androgenetic alopecia is supported by the absence of temporal
regression and baldness in cases of 5-alpha-reductase deficiency caused by mutations in the 5-alpha-reductase
gene [31]. the effect of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors in halting
the progression of hair loss in men further supports the role of
5-alpha-reductase in androgenetic alopecia [32].
individual susceptibility to hair loss and its severity is also
determined by local factors. a highly ordered intrinsic susceptibility of hair follicles to androgen gives a specific pattern of
hair loss. occipital hair is resistant to androgens, even when
it is transplanted into the vertex. however, vertex hair continues to miniaturize when transplanted on the forearm [33,34].
itami and inui proposed that the second-messenger system
determines whether androgen causes hair growth in beard
and axillary area and at the same time miniaturizes terminal
hair on the scalp [35].

cause the hair loss. ellis et al. suggested that abnormality of
the ar gene is necessary but not sufficient to cause the
phenotype [19]. the x chromosomal location of the ar gene
indicates that the maternal line is the major inheritance of
androgenetic alopecia in men. however, family studies have
shown resemblance of hair loss between fathers and sons, which
cannot be explained by ar gene mutations. this suggests that
other autosomal genes might also contribute to the phenotype.
hillmer et al. have investigated towards identification of
new susceptibility genes in aga. in a genome-wide scan
and fine-mapping linkage study performed on 95 families in
which at least two brothers had early-onset aga and both
parents were available, hillmer et al. found strong evidence
for an aga susceptibility locus on chromosome 3q26 [21].
this study could not confirm or rule out the relevance of
chromosomes 11q22-q24, 18p11-q22 and 19p13-q13 in
causing aga. another genome-wide association study done
by hillmer et al. found that a highly significant association
on chromosome 20p11, suggesting that the 20p11 locus
has a role in a yet-to-be-identified androgen-independent
pathway [22].
the role of the 5-alpha-reductase enzyme in male androgenetic alopecia (maa) is evident by the part it plays in the
metabolism of testosterone to dht and the effect of
5-alpha-reductase inhibitors in treating hair loss. genetic
association studies of the 5-alpha-reductase genes  xxxg2199xxx 
on chromosome 5 and  xxxg2200xxx  on chromosome 2, done
using dimorphic intragenic restriction fragment length polymorphisms in 828 families, failed to show an association
between these genes and maa [23].
the cytochrome p450 alpha-aromatase enzyme has also
been found to contribute to androgenetic alopecia. aromatase

clinical features

the essential feature of male androgenetic alopecia is patterned
hair loss. the progression of the hair loss occurs in the orderly
manner described by hamilton and norwood [36,37]. if not
treated in the early stage, hair loss progresses, leaving a

male androgenetic alopecia

completely hair less scalp, particularly on the crown; occipital
hair is usually preserved (figure 2). the onset of hair loss and
the rate of progression varies from person to person.
close examination with a hand-held epiluminescent microscope (dermatoscope) demonstrates that scalp hairs exist as
compound follicles with two to five terminal hairs emerging
from a single pore. in the balding scalp, the terminal hairs
within these compound follicles are progressively replaced
by finer and shorter vellus hairs such that only one or two terminal hairs can be seen emerging from a single pore in
affected areas (figure 3). a reduction in the volume of hair
can be noticed when the number of terminal hairs per follicular unit decreases; however, baldness becomes visible only
when all the terminal hairs are miniaturized. dermatoscopy
can demonstrate hair diameter diversity due to progressive
miniaturization before clinical baldness is visible and is characteristic of androgenetic alopecia [38]. in addition, a reduction in the number of terminal hairs in a single pore is a
useful feature in early diagnosis of androgenetic alopecia in
patients presenting with increased hair shedding. by contrast,
compound follicles persist on the occipital scalp even in
advance stages of male-pattern hair loss.

treatments currently in use

minoxidil
oral minoxidil has been used to treat hypertension since the
1960s [39]. hypertrichosis as a consequence of minoxidil treatment was observed shortly thereafter and has been said to
occur in 100% of users [40-42]. these observations led to the
development of topical minoxidil as a treatment for hair
loss [43]. it was approved by the fda for the treatment of
male androgentic alopecia in 1984. both 2 and 5% solutions
are currently in use for treatment in male; the 5% monoxidil
solution has shown higher efficacy than the 2% solution [44].
new 5%  xxxd2649xxx  is now available and reported to
be as effective as the solution [45]. a 5-year follow-up study
with topical minoxidil has shown a sustained effect [46].
a number of investigators have advanced hypotheses as to
the mechanism of action of minoxidil. one important hypothesis concerns its vasodilatory properties. cutaneous blood flow
was observed to increase 10 -- 15 min after applying topical
minoxidil [47]. upregulation of  xxxg2413xxx  (vegf) is another important action of minoxidil that
helps to maintain dermal papilla vasculature and hair
growth [48]. li et al. proposed a possible mechanism for minoxidil stimulation of vegf from experiments on dermal papilla
cells [49]. they suggest that binding of minoxidil to adenosine
receptors a1 and a2, as well as to the sulphonylurea receptor
sur2b, activates adenosine signalling pathways and increases
the release of vegf. over-expression of vegf increase
peri-follicular vascularization and accelerate hair growth.
the prevailing view is that minoxidil promotes hair regrowth
through its action as a  xxxg1232xxx  opener [50,51]. the
effect on the cell cycle is to initiate the onset of anagen (and
4.1

1298

thereby shorten the duration of telogen) and to prolong
the duration of anagen by delaying initiation of catagen.
patients commonly observe increased hair shedding a few
weeks after starting therapy; this resolves spontaneously with
continued treatment.
hypertrichosis on the face and hands is a common side
effect observed after topical minoxidil. itching of the scalp,
increased dandruff and erythema are commonly reported.
contact allergic dermatitis to minoxidil can occur and could
be due either to minoxidil itself or, more commonly, to  xxxd3034xxx  in the vehicle [52]. patch testing is worthwhile
in differentiating the cause of contact dermatitis and the
new minoxidil form that does not contain  xxxd3034xxx 
is an alternative in these patients.
finasteride
finasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase type ii inhibitor that acts by
reducing scalp dht levels [53]. scalp biopsies before and after
treatment with finasteride show a reduction of scalp dht by
60 -- 75% [54]. the optimal dose of finasteride in the treatment of androgenetic alopecia is 1 mg a day. placebocontrolled studies have shown that finasteride significantly
increases hair count after 1 -- 2 years of therapy and the effect
is sustained after 5 years of therapy [55-58]. an open, randomized, comparative study with 5% topical minoxidil and oral
finasteride 1 mg a day showed significantly more hair growth
in the finasteride group [59].
good-quality serial photographs (pre- and post-treatment)
are important for patient and clinician to make an objective
assessment of the clinical response to finasteride (figure 4).
decreased libido, erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory problems have been reported in around 3 -- 5% of men [60]. gynecomastia, exfoliative dermatitis, testicular pain and depressive
mood changes have been observed in rare cases [61]. finasteride
reduces  xxxg1281xxx  (psa) levels by approximately
50% and adjustments should be made when interpreting
screening tests for prostate cancer [62]. finasteride also affects
the rate and grade of prostate cancer. there is a 25% overall
reduction in the prevalence of prostate cancer but a small relative increase in the percentage of high-grade cancers, limiting its
use as a chemoprevention agent [63].
4.2

dutasteride
dutasteride has similar characteristics as finasteride but is
more potent in reducing scalp dht. it inhibits both type i
and ii 5-alpha-reductase enzymes.
dutasteride is fda approved for the treatment of benign
prostatic hyperplasia (bph). phase ii studies in androgenetic
alopecia demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in hair
growth and the efficacy of finasteride 2.5 mg/day was superior to that of finasteride 5 mg/day [64]. twin studies showed
that 0.5 mg dutasteride a day for 1 year resulted in significantly more hair growth than placebo [65]. a single-case report
showed improvement with dutasteride in a woman who had

the prostaglandin analogue,  xxxd2446xxx , stimulates hair

lengthening of eyelashes and eye brows has been observed
when  xxxd2446xxx  is used topically for glaucoma [70] but
there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that it has efficacy
in stimulating scalp hair growth.
5.1

hair transplantation

hair transplantation involves removal of hair from the occipital scalp and reimplantation into the bald vertex and frontal
scalp. with modern techniques, graft survival in excess of
90% can be reliably achieved. prerequisites for the procedure
are stabilization of the hair loss with medical treatment and
good donor hair population on the occipital hair.
the modern hair transplant technique was started in japan
in 1930s, when small punch grafts were used to cover damaged eyebrows or lashes [67]. orentreich reported on the use
of autografts and proposed the term ‘donor dominance’ [68]
in that hair taken from the androgen-resistant occipital
scalp remains androgen resistant when implanted into the
androgen-sensitive bald areas of the scalp.
in 1995, bernstein and rassman introduced follicular unit
transplantation, by which hair is transplanted in naturally occurring units of 1 -- 4 hairs [69]. in follicular unit transplantation,
donor hair can be harvested in two different ways:
1) strip harvesting: a strip of scalp 8 -- 14 mm and 20 -30 cm is removed from the occipital scalp under local
anaesthesia and the wound sutured. the donor hair is
then separated into follicular units and transplanted
to the balding area. the main disadvantage of this
method is that it leaves a linear scar in the donor occipital area, although this could be concealed with the
remaining occipital hair.
2) follicular unit extraction (fue) harvesting: individual
follicles of occipital hair are removed under local anaesthesia with 1 mm punch biopsies. each unit is then reinserted on the bald areas of the scalp using a micro blade.
this technique leaves no visible scars as single follicular
1300

units are removed instead of a large amount of tissue, it
also takes less time to heal than strip harvesting.

 xxxg183xxx  blockers
androgen and androgen receptors play a major role in the pathogenesis of androgenetic alopecia.  xxxg183xxx  blockers,
including spironolactone,  xxxd1786xxx  and  xxxd2143xxx ,
have demonstrated efficacy in female-pattern hair loss. when
treated with either spironolactone or  xxxd1786xxx  for
12 months, 88% of patients with biopsy-proven female pattern
hair loss have shown partial improvement or no progression of
the disease [71]. however, a 12-month randomized trail comparing 2% minoxidil and  xxxd1786xxx  failed to demonstrate superior efficacy of antiandrogen therapy over topical
minoxidil [72]. placebo-controlled studies are necessary to confirm the efficacy of anti-androgens in female-pattern hair loss.
however, feminization in males does not warrant their use in
male-pattern hair loss. the use of  xxxd2143xxx  is limited by the
risk of serious, albeit rare, hepatotoxicity.

combination of medical and surgical
therapy

an open, randomized, parallel-group study comparing the
efficacy of available medications as monotherapy or combined
therapy (finasteride alone, finasteride + 2% topical minoxidil,

shampoo) showed that finasteride in combination with either
topical minoxidil or ketoconazole showed significantly better
hair regrowth than finasteride monotherapy, and showed no
difference in the incidence of side effects. it is inferred that a
combination of medications with different mechanisms of
action enhances the efficacy [73].
topical minoxidil and finasteride can be useful adjuncts to
hair transplant surgery for aga. studies have found that topical use of minoxidil in the peri-operative period could prevent
the usual shedding that occurs 1 -- 2 weeks after transplantation
and speed the time for regrowth [74]. these results were confirmed by a double-blind trial that showed that significantly
less grafted hair was lost during the shedding period [75]. the
use of topical minoxidil as a premedication in hair transplant
surgery has the advantage of stabilizing the hair loss, increasing
the number of hairs in anagen and decreasing post-surgical telegon effluvium. minoxidil should be stopped 2 -- 3 days before
surgery to minimize skin irritation and reduce the theoretical
risk of intraoperative bleeding caused by vasodilation. therapy
should be restarted again after 1 -- 2 weeks. a randomized,
double-blind trial using finasteride 1 mg daily or placebo in
79 men with aga 4 weeks before and 48 weeks after hair transplantation demonstrated that the treatment group had significant improvement from baseline, in comparison with placebo
group [76].

expert opinion

distribution over the scalp. miniaturization initially leads
to loss of hair volume and later to bald areas on the scalp.
genetic predisposition seems to be more important than
environmental factors in the aetiology. the pathogenesis
involves interaction of testosterone and its more active metabolite dht, with androgen receptors leading to changes in
hair cycling.
medical treatment involves inhibiting the of synthesis dht
using 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and
dutasteride or medications that alter hair cycle dynamics such
as minoxidil. finasteride has been shown to arrest hair loss in
most men and to stimulate partial regrowth in around 66%.
dutasteride 2.5 mg/day appears more effective than finasteride 5 mg/day at stimulating regrowth, but phase iii clinical
trials are required to confirm this. topical minoxidil is also
effective in arresting hair loss and stimulating regrowth and
can be used in combination with finasteride or dutasteride to
maximize regrowth.
 xxxg183xxx  antagonists block the effect of both
dht and testosterone, and lead to hypo-androgenization,
which is poorly tolerated by men. surgical treatment utilized
the principle of donor dominance, whereby the individual follicle retains its intrinsic relative propensity to balding after
relocation to a different site. hair transplantation is required
to restore hair in more advanced cases.
