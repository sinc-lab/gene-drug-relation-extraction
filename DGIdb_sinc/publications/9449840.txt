in c3 plants large amounts of photorespiratory glycine (gly) are
converted to serine by the tetrahydrofolate (thf)-dependent activities of the gly decarboxylase complex (gdc) and serine hydroxymethyltransferase ( xxxg2069xxx ). using 13c nuclear magnetic resonance,
we monitored the flux of carbon through the gdc/ xxxg2069xxx  enzyme
system in arabidopsis thaliana (l.) heynh. columbia exposed to
inhibitors of thf-synthesizing enzymes. plants exposed for 96 h to
sulfanilamide, a dihydropteroate synthase inhibitor, showed little
reduction in flux through gdc/ xxxg2069xxx . two other sulfonamide analogs were tested with similar results, although all three analogs
competitively inhibited the partially purified enzyme. however,
methotrexate or aminopterin, which are confirmed inhibitors of
arabidopsis  xxxg631xxx , decreased the flux through the
gdc/ xxxg2069xxx  system by 60% after 48 h and by 100% in 96 h. the
uptake of [a-13c]gly was not inhibited by either drug class. the
specificity of methotrexate action was shown by the ability of
5-formyl-thf to restore flux through the gdc/ xxxg2069xxx  pathway in
methotrexate-inhibited plants. the experiments with sulfonamides
strongly suggest that the mitochondrial thf pool has a long halflife. the studies with methotrexate support the additional, critical
role of  xxxg631xxx  in recycling thf oxidized in thymidylate synthesis.

thf coenzymes are required in the synthesis of thymidylate, purine nucleotides, amino acids, and in organellar
protein synthesis (cossins, 1987; appling, 1991). in many
cellular systems the single carbons involved in thfdependent processes are derived from the b-carbon of ser
(schirch, 1984; narkewicz et al., 1996).  xxxg2069xxx  catalyzes the
transfer of a methylene group from ser to thf for direct
use in thymidylate synthesis; alternatively, ch2-thf is
reduced to ch3-thf by methylene-thf reductase or oxidized to hco-thf by c1-thf-synthase (appling, 1991;
nour and rabinowitz, 1991) and then used in other thfdependent cellular processes. in c3 plants the gdc/ xxxg2069xxx 
enzyme system is considered to be the major pathway for
the generation of single-carbon units via ser. this is a

consequence of photorespiration, which requires large
amounts of gly to be metabolized by this enzyme system
(oliver, 1994). in arabidopsis thaliana the flux of single
carbons into ser via the gdc/ xxxg2069xxx  pathway is 4-fold
greater than that through the alternative  xxxg1473xxx /
 xxxg2069xxx  pathway (prabhu et al., 1996a). below we describe
some biochemical relationships between enzymes that regenerate the cofactor thf (fig. 1) and carbon flux through
the thf-dependent gdc/ xxxg2069xxx  enzyme system in a.
thaliana (l.) heynh. columbia wild type.
antagonists of thf biosynthesis have been developed
for clinical use as antiproliferative and antimicrobial
agents, which exploit the critical role that thf coenzymes
play in cellular metabolism (pratt and taylor, 1990). sulfanilamide and its analogs (fig. 2) inhibit dhps (fig. 1),
whereas methotrexate (fig. 2) and its analogs inhibit dhfr
(fig. 2) isolated from a number of organisms (cossins,
1987; pratt and taylor, 1990; schweitzer et al., 1990). dhps
is involved in the de novo pathway of thf biosynthesis,
whereas dhfr has a dual role (fig. 1); it is involved in the
reduction of dihydrofolate to thf from both the de novo
pathway and that arising from the oxidation of thf during
ts activity. these drugs may be useful in manipulating the
availability of thf in higher plants, hence permitting a
better understanding of its metabolism.
we previously used a combined dosage of sulfanilamide
and methotrexate with qualitative nmr observations to
demonstrate the requirement of thf for ser synthesis via
the gdc/ xxxg2069xxx  and  xxxg1473xxx / xxxg2069xxx  pathways
in arabidopsis (prabhu et al., 1996a). combined dosages
have also been used to demonstrate the thf-dependent
metabolism of ser through the  xxxg1473xxx / xxxg2069xxx 
pathway in yeast (pasternack et al., 1994). the arabidopsis
study suggested that thf metabolism in this organism is
organized differently from that in other eukaryotes. recent
studies of pea leaves suggested that thf metabolism is

here, using nmr, we quantify the fluxes of carbon
through the gdc/ xxxg2069xxx  enzyme system in arabidopsis,
as influenced by exposure to drugs that inhibit dhps and

ments were repeated three or more times and the data are
presented as the means with respective se values.
nmr parameters
nmr spectra were collected on an amx 500-mhz instrument (bruker, billerica, ma). 13c chemical shifts from natural abundance spectra of authentic samples were first
obtained in 100 mm phosphate buffered to ph 7.3 and
25°c, internally referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane5-sulfonic acid, sodium salt (prabhu et al., 1996b). assignments of resonances in the extracts were confirmed by
spiking the extracts with authentic samples (prabhu et al.,
1996a).
quantitative analyses of 13c-enriched compounds in the
plants were accomplished using extracts. two sets of acquisition parameters were used: (a) inverse-gated decoupled experiments with a 20-s delay time and (b) standard broad-band experiments, details of which have been
described previously (prabhu et al., 1996a). all peaks were
calibrated relative to a solution of 2 mm sodium [13c]formate in 100 mm potassium phosphate (ph 7.3), sealed in a
capillary and inserted concentrically into the 5-mm tube
containing the sample. the 13c-13c multiplets versus 13c12
c center-line singlets of the protonated carbons of interest were quantitated using integration and isotopomer
analyses; their intensities are independent of potential differences in t1 and nuclear overhauser effects (london et
al., 1975; suzuki et al., 1975), especially under conditions of
gated decoupling with long delay times (gadian, 1982), as
used here. however, the differential intensities of the b-13c
versus the a-13c in ser under broad-band decoupling were
corrected for using data generated from standard curves of
authentic compounds obtained under similar experimental
conditions.
1
h spectra were acquired using a 9.7-ms (90°) pulse, a
spectral width of 7812 hz, an acquisition time of 2 s, and a
delay time of 1 s. the sample temperature was maintained
at 25°c and 32,000 data points were acquired for each
sample. attenuation of the water resonance was achieved
by presaturation (2 s at 40 db). one hundred twenty scans
were acquired for each sample and a line broadening of 0.3
hz was used in the processing of the free induction decay.
chemical shifts from natural abundance spectra of authentic samples were first obtained in 100 mm phosphate buffered to ph 7.3 and 25°c, referenced internally to 2,2dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid and externally to a
10 mm solution of tsp in 100 mm potassium phosphate (ph
7.3), sealed in a capillary and inserted concentrically into
the 5-mm tube containing the sample. the spectra of the
plant extracts were acquired with the external standard,
tsp only; the singlet of the trimethyl resonance of tsp was
set to zero. assignments of peaks in the extracts were
confirmed by spiking the sample with pure compounds.
extraction and assay of dhfr
root material from plants grown in liquid culture was
harvested, blotted dry with paper towels, and frozen at
280°c. the tissue was then ground in a mortar on ice using

139

a small amount of acid-washed sand. a buffer containing
100 mm potassium phosphate (ph 7.5), 1 mm edta, 1 mm
pmsf, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 20 mm 2- xxxd26xxx 
was added while grinding until a fine slurry was achieved.
the slurry was filtered through three layers of cheesecloth
and centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000g for 10 min in a ja-25.5 rotor
using an avanti j-25 instrument (beckman). the supernatant was treated with solid ammonium sulfate, and protein
precipitating between 30 and 60% ammonium sulfate saturation was removed by centrifugation as described above
and stored overnight at 220°c. storage overnight resulted
in better activity than if the enzyme was assayed directly
after salt precipitation. the protein was desalted over a
sephadex g-25 column (pharmacia) and its concentration
was estimated by the method of bradford (1976). dhfr
activity was assayed spectrophotometrically (misra et al.,
1961). the assay was done in a final volume of 500 ml
containing 100 mm potassium phosphate (ph 7.5), 100 mm
nadph, 100 mm dihydrofolic acid, 500 mg of protein, and
various concentrations of methotrexate or aminopterin.
the enzyme activity was monitored by recording the
change in a340 once every 30 s for 10 min, using a photodiode array spectrophotometer (du 7400, beckman). controls lacking dihydrofolate were used to subtract nonspecific oxidation of nadph. specific activity was expressed
as nanomoles of dihydrofolate reduced to thf per milligram of protein per hour.

the rationale for the 13c-enrichment patterns of ser in
arabidopsis plants supplied with [a-13c]gly has been described previously (prabhu et al., 1996a). for this study
only [a,b-13c]ser and [b-13c]ser, the two species unequivocally ascribable to synthesis via gdc/ xxxg2069xxx  activities,
were taken into account; [a-13c]ser could be synthesized
using the alternative  xxxg1473xxx  pathway (prabhu et
al., 1996a). for a measure of flux through the gdc/ xxxg2069xxx 
enzyme system the 13c-enriched isotopomers of ser described above were quantitated after 6 h of supply of
[a-13c]gly. this was based on the relative patterns and
concentrations of isotopomers described from time-course
experiments in which we did not detect signals from potential products of further metabolism of ser such as hydroxypyruvate or other sugars (prabhu et al., 1996a). other
nmr studies of gly metabolism in plant cells also noted
little metabolism of the ser produced via the gdc/ xxxg2069xxx 
pathway in comparable periods (ashworth and mettler,
1984; neeman et al., 1985). in some animal cellular systems
the de novo incorporation of amino acids into proteins has
been shown to be sufficient to warrant correction in measurements of flux for specific pathways (flogel et al., 1997).
however, even in hydrolyzed extracts of our samples we
did not see nmr signals that would indicate incorporation
of 13c-enriched compounds into macromolecules (v.
prabhu, b. chatson, g. abrams, and j. king, unpublished
data). thus, our quantitative measurements of ser accumulation are a good representation of flux through the gdc/

sure to antifolates also resulted in an alteration in the pools
of single carbon (table ii). the proportion of the dually

c-enriched ser/g fresh weight/6 h.
individual effects of methotrexate and sulfanilamide
experiments were first performed with sulfanilamide
(fig. 3a) or methotrexate (fig. 3b) at a range of concentrations to evaluate their use in subsequent experiments. nonlimiting concentrations were then used to examine potential differences in the effects of the two classes of drugs.
methotrexate-treated plants displayed a strong reduction
in the flux of 13c through the gdc/ xxxg2069xxx  system, whereas
with sulfanilamide only a small effect was observed (table
i). after 96 h of exposure to the drugs, this flux could no
longer be detected in methotrexate-treated plants, whereas
with sulfanilamide only a slight reduction with respect to
the control was detected.

comparison of the effects of alternative analogs
we examined the effect of aminopterin (fig. 2), which
like methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor for dhfr, on
reduction of thf availability for the operation of the
gdc/ xxxg2069xxx  enzyme system in arabidopsis. a 48-h exposure to aminopterin, as with methotrexate, reduced the flux
by about 60% (table iii), and after exposures of 96 h, the
resonance of 13c-enriched ser could not be distinguished
above the background in the nmr spectra from either
treatment (not shown). the uptake of gly by plants was
unaffected by either aminopterin or methotrexate treatment (not shown).
a partially purified preparation of dhfr enzyme activity from arabidopsis leaves was completely inhibited by 1
mm methotrexate or aminopterin (data not shown). however, high levels of a nonspecific nadph-oxidizing activity were present in this leaf extract, which did not allow
nonlimiting concentrations of nadph to be maintained for
the determination of  xxxd1289xxx  values. these experiments were
then attempted using root preparations that had reduced
levels of the nonspecific nadph-oxidizing activity. controls were included to determine the nonspecific oxidation
of nadph. methotrexate and aminopterin were strong
inhibitors of the root dhfr preparation, with  xxxd1289xxx  values of
less than 10 nm for both analogs (fig. 5). germination of

time-dependent effects of simultaneous exposure to
methotrexate and sulfanilamide
plants exposed simultaneously to methotrexate (100 mm)
and sulfanilamide (2 mm) showed a time-dependent reduction in the flux of 13c through the gdc/ xxxg2069xxx  system,
although the cellular concentrations of [a-13c]gly did not
decrease (fig. 4). the reduction was approximately 50% in
the first 24 h, but a 96-h period was required to completely
reduce the ser signal to that of the background. no additive effect of sulfanilamide to methotrexate was obvious,
because the results were similar to those obtained with
methotrexate alone (table i). at 0 h of drug exposure the
concentration of [a-13c]gly was slightly lower than at
other time points, coinciding with the maximum flux.
quantitative isotopomer analyses showed that the expo-

experiments in which the effect of sulfadiazine (fig. 2)
was compared with that of sulfanilamide revealed that this
analog also did not reduce flux through the gdc/ xxxg2069xxx 
enzyme system in vivo (table iii). a third analog, sulfacetamide, was also tested and yielded similar results (not
shown). we used 1h nmr spectroscopy to determine
whether individual sulfonamides were present in the
shoots. when plants were supplied with sulfanilamide for
48 h, the accumulation of this compound in the shoots
could be detected from the resonances of the aromatic
hydrogens (fig. 6). the endogenous metabolite fumarate
was present in all of the samples that were examined. the
spectra are plotted using the intensity of the fumarate peak
as a convenient internal standard; the intensity of the fumarate peak and that of the external reference in replicates
of control and sulfonamide-treated plants were not significantly different from each other. when sulfacetamide was
supplied to arabidopsis, this compound could be detected
in the shoots from the aromatic resonances, as well as the
methyl resonance of the acetyl group (not shown). these
experiments confirmed that the supplied sulfonamides

in vitro experiments using a partially purified preparation of the dhps from arabidopsis showed that all three
analogs were highly potent inhibitors, with  xxxd1289xxx  values of
less than 20 mm (prabhu et al., 1997). germination of seeds
was completely inhibited and growth of 3-week-old plants
was reduced in flask culture in the presence of all three
analogs added singly (data not shown).
specificity of the inhibition by methotrexate
to determine if the decrease in flux after methotrexate
exposure was attributable to depletion of thf levels by
inhibition of dhfr, or rather to direct inhibition of the
gdc/ xxxg2069xxx  enzymes by polyglutamylated forms of methotrexate, we performed rescue experiments using  xxxd2462xxx  (fig. 2). figure 7 shows that the supply of  xxxd2462xxx 
after complete methotrexate inhibition restored flux
through the gdc/ xxxg2069xxx  enzyme system. during a 24-h
period the plants supplied with  xxxd2462xxx  showed a measurable flux, indicating that there was little direct inhibition of these enzymes by methotrexate (table iv). the
proportions of the individual species of 13c-enriched ser in
the  xxxd2462xxx -rescued plants were considerably different

was similar to the observation recorded in table ii.
discussion
the sulfonamide class of inhibitors caused only a slight
reduction in thf-dependent flux through the gdc/ xxxg2069xxx 
enzyme system in arabidopsis. studies of the target enzyme showed that the sulfonamide analogs were strong
inhibitors of the arabidopsis dhps (prabhu et al., 1997).
1
h nmr studies confirmed that under the conditions of
our experiments, the supplied sulfonamides were present
in the shoot tissue. the continued metabolism of gly in
plants exposed to sulfonamides is unlikely to have occurred using de novo-synthesized thf. therefore, our results suggest that the mitochondrial thf pool is either
large and/or has a long half-life.
high levels of folate were recorded in mitochondria isolated from pea leaves (neuburger et al., 1996); the large
mitochondrial folate pools likely reflect the requirement of
c3 plants to metabolize large amounts of gly to ser (oliver,
1994). studies of the partially purified dhps from arabidopsis (prabhu et al., 1997) lend some indirect support to
the idea that thf levels in arabidopsis may reach high or
nonlimiting levels. the product of the biosynthetic reac-

tion, dihydropteroic acid, competitively inhibits the enzyme activity. the dhps from pea leaves was also found to
be inhibited in this manner (rebeille et al., 1997). the
existence of such a mechanism indicates that product feedback inhibition could regulate the flow of metabolites when
thf levels are sufficient to meet cellular requirements.
methotrexate may inhibit thf-dependent enzymes in
vivo after undergoing polyglutamylation as observed in
animal cells (mcguire and coward, 1984; kim et al., 1993).
however, our  xxxd2462xxx  rescue experiments strongly suggested that the effects of methotrexate were restricted to
the inhibition of dhfr and that there was little, if any,

direct inhibition of gdc/ xxxg2069xxx  enzymes.  xxxd2462xxx  is
widely used in animal systems as a rescue agent from
methotrexate toxicity (stover and schirch, 1993). because it
is a fully reduced form of  xxxd2146xxx , its supply can alleviate
the inability of methotrexate-inhibited dhfr to supply
thf. also, in previous studies of the uptake and metabolism of methotrexate by plant cells it was found that methotrexate was a poor substrate for folylpolyglutamate synthetase (see fig. 1) from datura innoxia in in vitro assays,
and that methotrexate polyglutamylation in the cells themselves was only slight (wu et al., 1993, 1994). thus, unlike
in animal cells, polyglutamylation in plant cells may not be
a significant factor in the action of methotrexate.
dhfr plays an important role in the cellular functioning
of all organisms. our studies strengthen the idea of a
crucial role for dhfr in the reduction of dihydrofolate
produced by oxidation of thf by ts activity. in plants,
including arabidopsis, dhfr and ts are encoded by bifunctional genes coding for bifunctional polypeptides (lazar et al., 1993; luo et al., 1993, 1997; wang et al., 1996). the
direct channeling of dihydrofolate between the ts and
dhfr domains in bifunctional polypeptides has been proposed (knighton et al., 1994). in plants thymidylate synthesis may occur exclusively in the mitochondria
(neuburger et al., 1996). this could explain the rapid depletion of the thf required for mitochondrial gly metabolism in arabidopsis when dhfr activity is inhibited by
methotrexate. thus, methotrexate treatment had a more
dramatic effect than the sulfonamides on reducing the
availability of thf for mitochondrial gly metabolism.
methotrexate is a useful drug to manipulate thf availability in plants. exposure of arabidopsis plants to methotrexate resulted in changes in the isotopomers of [13c]ser
produced by the gdc/ xxxg2069xxx  system. the change in isotopomers could reflect an alteration in the pools of active
thf (hco-, ch-, ch2-, and ch3-) in the cellular system
arising from methotrexate action. in mammalian cells rapid
alterations in the proportions of one-carbon thf occur
after exposure to methotrexate, along with an increase in
the amount of dihydrofolates (allegra et al., 1986).
in arabidopsis methotrexate treatment reduced thf
availability, which in turn reduced the flux through the
gdc/ xxxg2069xxx  system. the reduced flux caused endogenous
(photorespiratory) gly concentrations to rise and increased
the 12ch2-thf:13ch2-thf ratio; this was recorded by
nmr as a decrease in the proportion of [a,b-13c]ser relative to the singly enriched species. the ratio of [a-13c]ser
to [b-13c]ser was approximately 2:1 in control and

143

methotrexate-treated plants. the 2:1 ratio in control plants
is reflective of the added flux through the c1-thf-synthase
pathway, resulting in higher levels of [a-13c]ser (prabhu
et al., 1996a). the maintenance of the 2:1 ratio in methotrexate-treated plants suggests that the gdc activity was
not directly inhibited by methotrexate. furthermore, the
pools of thf used by the two pathways are well equilibrated, because reduction in the [a-13c]ser signal paralleled that of [b-13c]ser. these suggestions are also supported by the  xxxd2462xxx  rescue experiments, which
showed the ability to restore flux through the gdc/ xxxg2069xxx 
and c1-thf-synthase pathways (again 2:1 ratio).
our antimetabolite experiments suggest several additional ideas about thf metabolism in arabidopsis. the
lack of reduction in gly metabolism by sulfonamides, and
the long time period required for complete inhibition by
methotrexate, indicate that cellular folate pools have a
relatively long half-life. the  xxxd2462xxx  rescue experiments
indicate that reduced folates can be transported across
mitochondrial membranes because the supplied  xxxd2462xxx 
was able to restore mitochondrial metabolism of gly. in
other eukaryotes the parallel paths of thf metabolism in
the cytosol and mitochondria are largely interconnected by
transport of single carbons in the form of formate, gly, or
ser between these two cellular compartments (appling,
1991). however, information on the compartmentation of
thf metabolism and thymidylate synthesis in plants is
limited, and the few individual studies have suggested
quite different pictures of these processes in plants (cella et
al., 1991; huangpu et al., 1996; neuburger et al., 1996; luo
et al., 1997).
to our knowledge, this study demonstrated for the first
time in a higher plant, and as far as we know in any cellular
system, the distinctly different effects of methotrexate and
sulfanilamide on thf-dependent metabolism. the nmr
approach to examine these problems was particularly useful. the results shed new light on the regulation of thf
metabolism in plants and accentuate the dual role played
by dhfr in contrast to that of dhps. the direct monitoring of the effects of these drugs on the major pathway
producing carbons for use in other thf-dependent processes is our first step toward understanding the relationships between thf biosynthesis and thf-dependent cellular metabolism in plants. studies of thf-dependent
processes that occur outside the mitochondria should lead
to a better understanding of the compartmentation of thf
metabolism in higher plants.
