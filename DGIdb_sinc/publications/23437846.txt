early 1970s. albert yuzpe developed the yuzpe regimen named
after him [4], and in 1975 a method was introduced that used
progestin only [5]; the same year saw the launch of a copper iud
as a method of postcoital contraception. at the beginning of the
1980s  xxxd1806xxx  was examined as one was hoping that it would have
fewer side effects than the yuzpe regimen, but unfortunately, it
proved to be ineffective. therefore the yuzpe regimen became the
standard method of postcoital contraception in many countries in
the 1980s. in the years following, interest rose in methods that
used progestin only. the special program on human
reproduction (hrp) run by the who (in collaboration with the
world bank) conducted a large-scale comparative study between
the use of 2  0.75 mg levonorgestrel (lng) and the yuzpe
regimen and after that began to promote the use of the lng
method [6,7]. more recently  xxxg1737xxx  modulators
have been developed for emergency contraception (ec) [8].
currently available are the following methods: the single use
of a combination of estrogen and gestagen ( xxxd2054xxx 
together with lng); the single use of a progestin (lng); the use
of the mifepristone (mifegyn, mifeprex) (see table 1), and the
insertion of a copper iud (for all iuds its an ‘‘off-label’’
insertion, but not for the small gynfix, a copper chain iud
(contrel/belgium) in the european union). in addition to those
methods, the substance  xxxd3466xxx , marketed as  xxxd3466xxx  (30 mg as a
single dose), has been available in europe since october 2009 as a
method for postcoital contraception up to five days after
unprotected sexual intercourse (upsi) – this method will be
discussed in detail in the following chapter.

a combination of  xxxd2054xxx /levonorgestrel
(known as yuzpe regimen)
in 1977 yuzpe and lancee [9] described a combined method for
postcoital contraception consisting of 100 mg  xxxd2054xxx  and
0.5 mg lng; in this case the first dose is taken within 72 hours
after having upsi, and the second dose 12 hours after the first
one. this method was the most common one in the usa for
postcoital contraception. the same was true for other countries, as
the yuzpe regimen allows to use conventional oral combination
pills together with lng. in case of upsi during the second or
third week of the menstrual cycle the probability of getting
pregnant lies at 8:100. when applying the yuzpe regimen, only
2 in 100 women became pregnant, corresponding to a risk
reduction of 75%. a metaanalysis done by trussell et al. [10] –
analysing eight studies – showed a risk reduction of 74% (95%-ci:
63–79%).
the most important side effects are nausea (50%) and vomiting
(20%). so far, no study has examined the impact vomiting might
have on contraceptive safety. some doctors prescribe anti-emetics
as a routine or have women take in the hormone dose once more if
the vomiting occurs within one to two hours after the first intake.
less frequent are strong vaginal bleeding and breast pain. the
next menstruation starts within three weeks after the treatment.
for 83% of the women the bleeding started prior to the expected
menstruation, and for 8% it started four or even more days after.
with consideration of the safety of medical treatment no hints are
found that a postcoital application of a combination of estrogenprogestin compounds will cause cardio-vascular side effects [11].
in england an interim analysis done in 1999 showed that the
‘morning-after pill’ had been given in 4 million cases over a
period of 13 years without a significant rise in the risk of deep
vein thrombosis in the legs [12]. therefore there are no absolute
contraindications except that of an existing pregnancy.
nevertheless, any individual risk of thrombophilia should be
taken into account – if needed, a short-term heparinisation
(up to three days) may be suggested. moreover, there are studies

gynecol endocrinol, 2013; 29(s1): 1–14

available which show that this type of ‘morning-after pill’ does
not provide a teratogenic risk for the foetus in case the
method fails.
levonorgestrel method
this method comprises the intake of 0.75 mg lng within 72
hours after upsi and twelve hours later. in a large-scale, double
blinded trial done by the who [12], enrolling 1998 women in 14
countries, the lng method was compared to the yuzpe regimen.
among those women using lng the expected pregnancy rate
decreased by 85% (95%-ci: 74–93%). only 23% of all women in
the lng group complained of nausea, and merely 5.6% of
vomiting – in the group using the yuzpe regimen there were 19%.
both groups saw a decrease in effectiveness regarding the time
between the intercourse and the beginning of the treatment
within the 72-hour timeframe analysed [6,15]. a single dose of
1.5 mg of lng was shown to be as effective as the devided doses
and with similar rates of side effects [6] following these studies
and until to date, lng 1.5 mg as a single dose taken as soon as
possible and within 72 hours of upsi has become the recommended regimen for oral ec pill. although ec with 1.5 mg
lng has contributed to the prevention of unwanted pregnancies,
it has limitations in terms of efficacy which drops significantly
with the time elapsed since upsi. pregnancy rates with lng
ec in the first 24 hours are approximately 1.5%, but increase
to 2.6% during the period of 48–72 hours after exposure [16–19].
to increase access and allow use within the time frame when
it is most effective lng emergency contraceptive pills are
available over the counter in many countries. if administered at
least 2 days prior to the luteinizing hormone (lh) surge, lng
causes either a delay or an inhibition of the lh surge, therefore
delays or inhibits ovulation in women [20–23]. however, if given
when lh has already started to rise, lng cannot prevent
ovulation [22].
furthermore lng in regimen used for ec does not affect
endometrial development or progesterone level [22]. human
embryo implantation when studied in vitro is unaffected by lng
[24]. animal studies confirm that lng does not affect fertilization or implantation [25,26]. these experimental findings are in
line with the clinical data on lng ec [27].
no increased rate in ectopic pregnancies has been
observed [60].
lng ec would not harm the development of a fetus if used after
a contraceptive failure or taken by mistake in early pregnancy.
zhang and colleagues [59] reported in a cohort study, that the
rates of miscarriage and malformations and sex ratio at birth were
not statistically significantly different between women who used
lng for ec during their conception cycle and those who did not
use any hormonal medications.
mifepristone
mifepristone is an anti-gestagen, which was mainly developed to
allow medical termination of pregnancies (review australian
public assessment report for mifepristone) [61]. however, it is
suitable to be used as an emergency contraceptive pill, too, as
numerous trials have shown. two randomised trials compared
mifepristone, at a dosage of 600 mg, to the yuzpe regimen
[28,29]. mifepristone showed a contraceptive effect of 100%
when taken for postcoital contraception. another large-scale
randomised trial giving 600 mg, 50 mg and 10 mg as single doses
within the first five day after upsi showed that all three ways of
treatment reduced the pregnancy rate by 85%; however, the begin
of the next menstruation significantly correlated with the dosage:
a dose of 600 mg led to a delay of one week in 36%, a dose of

50 mg to a delay in 23%, and a dose of less than 10 mg only to a
delay in 18% of the cases. mifepristone in doses of 10 or 25 mg
are available for ec in china. the effect of mifepristone is well
known to be depending on time of treatment during the menstrual
cycle and the dose given. a variety of regimens with a single dose
as low as 10 mg have been shown to interrupt follicle development
thus delay or inhibit ovulation [22,30–32]. while higher
doses affect endometrial receptivity and prevents implantation
[24,33–35] 10 mg mifepristone has little or no effect on the
endometrium [22].

 xxxd3466xxx  – a  xxxg1737xxx  modulator
substance
 xxxd3466xxx  acetate (upa) is the first selective progesterone
receptor modulator (sprm) approved for ec (figure 1). thus it
belongs to the large group of  xxxg1737xxx  ligands whose
effects stretch from one end of the range, i.e. acting as pure
agonists (i. e. progesterone itself) to the other extreme, i. e. that of
pure progesterone antagonists. selective  xxxg1737xxx 
modulators (sprm) are located quite in the centre of the range as
they feature both agonistic and antagonistic qualities.
development
upa was developed by hra pharma in collaboration with the us
national institute of health in bethesda, maryland. the time to
develop the compound was nearly ten years from the early
experimental stage to the phase iii clinical trials. in the mid of
2009 upa was granted marketing authorisation for europe by the
emea. the indication is the one for ec up to 120 hours (5 days)
after upsi or contraceptive failure.

upa is a synthetic  xxxg1737xxx  modulator with oral
effect which relies on a high binding affinity at the human
 xxxg1737xxx . the main mechanism consists of blocking
or delaying ovulation. clinical trials have shown that upa
depending on its dose (10–100 mg), delays the growth of the
leading follicle (graafian follicle) in the mid of the follicular
phase. as a result, this leads to a delay in ovulation which was
most significant in the highest doses used (50 and 100 mg
micronized). this allows upa to be effective even when
administered immediately before ovulation when lh has already
started to rise, a time when use of lng or yuzpe is too late for
ovulation inhibition. in a study comparing early luteal phase
treatment with placebo, 10, 50 or 100 mg unmicronized upa a
significant delay in endometrial maturation was seen in the 50 and
100 mg groups compared to the placebo and the 10 mg group
upon biopsy four to six days after ovulation [36]. treatment with
upa resulted in a significant dose-dependent decrease in
endometrial thickness as well as an increase in glandular p
receptors. yet, in the doses relevant for ec use (30 mg) upa has
no significant effect on the endometrium.

comparison the mode of action of lng with upa in
clinical studies
three studies investigated the mechanism of action of levonogestrel and upa for ec:
(1) according to croxatto et al. [41] and massai et al. [40] using
upa there is a significant higher number of cycles with with
no follicle rupture within 5 days after treatment (administered with a follicular diameter of 18 mm) using upa
(figure 3).
(2) brache et al. [42] showed that upa caused a delay of
preovulatory lh by 4 days (figure 4) and a high proportion
of women (59%) without follicle rupture within 5 days
after treatment in a small group of subjects and in only a
single trial. lng is not effective to suppress a beginning
lh-surge.
if this phenomenon is drug or dose-related cannot be decided,
because studies with higher lng-dosages are missing. due to the
fact that the lh-surge is a rapid release of prestored lh from
pituitary vesicles the upa should interact with the pituitary lh
release from its vesicles. further studies must show if these
vesicles bear progesterone receptors and exocytosis can be
blocked by prms.
a summary of the mode of action is given in figure 2.

studies of receptor binding
in vitro, upa competitively binds to the  xxxg1737xxx ,
the  xxxg1601xxx  and the  xxxg183xxx .
simultaneously, it shows only a low affinity to  xxxg730xxx 
or  xxxg1602xxx . in addition to that, upa also shows
a high affinity to the  xxxg1601xxx ; in vitro antiglucocorticoid effects were shown when tested on animals.

endometrium and implantation
in a recent review gemzell-danielsson et al. [64] analysed the
mechanism of action of ecs. based on their clinical data and
in vitro experiments the authors showed that there is no significant
effect on the endometrial development with low dose mifepristone. although 10 mg of mifepristone may have some minor

effects on expression of progesterone receptors or local factors
this did not impair endometrial receptivity or embryo implantation. this could also be applied for upa [64]. upa caused a
significant dose-dependent decrease in endometrial thickness, an
increase in glandular p receptors, and a decrease in peripheral
node addressins in a dose dependent way similar to that seen for
mifepristone stratton et al. [65,66]. thus low dose upa (30 mg)
as used for ec has no significant effect on endometrial receptivity
and implantation [67].
in contrast upa (5 mg daily, orally) used for treatment of
leiomyoma is causing endometrial changes known as paec
mutter et al. [68], rabe et al. [69] observed for all prms during
chronical use, a phenomenon not occurring after application of a
single dosage. in patients using 5 mg upa for 3 month as a
treatment for leiomyoma three pregnancies occurred. if paec
changes occur with this treatment, they do not seem to prevent
implantation.

drug safety
preclincal studies
preclinical data on safety
based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology,
toxicity in case of repeated intake and genotoxicity, the preclinical
data do not reveal any particular harm for human beings. most of
the effects discovered in the general toxicity studies could be
related to the mechanism as a modulator to the progesterone
receptor and the  xxxg1601xxx . anti-progesterone
effects occurred at an exposition comparable to that of a
therapeutic treatment.

as expected, upa is embryotoxic at low doses, when given to rats
and rabbits in repeated doses at gestation days 6–17 or 6–18
respectively. considering the pharmacodynamics of the product
and the indication applied for, the most important effects to
consider are those in live foetuses, and the applicant has chosen a
dose in the embryo/foetal studies that allows sufficient foetuses to
survive for examination. in rats and rabbits, no effects in live
foetuses were observed at doses up to 1 mg/kg/day in the pivotal
studies.’’
comment: at doses, which were low enough to maintain
gestation in the animal species no teratogenic potential was
observed. the safety for a human embryo is unknown, but
no safety signal has been noticed from use of the product for
ec [71].

summary of clinical data on the contraceptive efficacy of
lng and upa

for personal use only.

overview about clinical trials analysing the contraceptive
efficacy of the yuzpe method, lng and upa for ec (see
table 3 and 4).
yuzpe and lng-method. in the original study of piaggio et al.
[18] no difference has been seen between the yuzpe and the lngmethod (2  750 mg in a 12 hour time difference) and the pooled
data analysis showe a decline of contraceptive efficacy linear by
time elapsed after upsi (figure 1), with has no been verified by
later studies such as [14,37]. whereas creinin et al. [37] showed
lowest pregnancies values (1.0%) after 25–28 hours and a highest
rate after 49–72 hours (2.8%) glasier could not see a change over
time up to 5 days (table 4).
three studies analysed the effect of postcoital lng and upa
administration after upsi:
– creinin et al. [37] compared the efficacy and adverse effects of
upa to lng for ec in randomized, double blinded noninferiority
trial, enrolling healthy women seeking ec within 72 hours of
upsi. participants were randomly assigned to receive a single
dose of 50 mg of upa, plus a placebo 12 hours later or two doses
of 0.75 mg of lng taken 12 hours apart. follow-up was
scheduled 5 to 7 days after the expected onset of the next
menstrual period. daily diaries were used from the time of ec use
until next menses to record adverse effects and sexual activity.
results: contraceptive efficacy was evaluable in 775 of upa
users and 774 of lng users. pregnancies occurred in 7 (0.9%,
0.2–1.6%) and 13 (1.7%, 0.8–2.6%) women, respectively. based
on the estimated cycle day of upsi, 85% and 69% of anticipated
pregnancies, respectively, were averted.
conclusion: upa is at least as effective as lng in preventing
pregnancies after upsi and has a similar side effect profile (level
of evidence: i).
– fine et al. [38] evaluated the efficacy and safety of upa as ec
in women presenting 48–120 hours after receiving upa for upsi.
women aged 18 years or older with regular cycles who presented
for ec 48 to 120 hours after upsi were enrolled in 45 planned
parenthood clinics and treated with a single dose of 30 mg upa.
pregnancy status was determined by high-sensitivity urinary
 xxxd2228xxx  testing and return of menses.
results: a total of 1241 women were evaluated for efficacy.
twenty-six were pregnant at follow-up, for a pregnancy rate of
2.1% (95% confidence interval 1.4–3.1%). these results satisfy
the protocol-defined statistical criteria for success because the
pregnancy rate was lower than both the estimated expected
pregnancy rate and a predefined clinical irrelevance threshold. in
addition, efficacy did not decrease over time: pregnancy rates
were 2.3% (1.4–3.8%), 2.1% (1.0–4.1%), and 1.3% (0.1–4.8%) for
intervals of 48 to 72 hours, more than 72 to 96 hours, and more
than 96 to 120 hours, respectively. adverse events were mainly
mild or moderate, the most frequent being headache, nausea, and
abdominal pain. cycle length increased a mean of 2.8 days,
whereas the duration of menstrual bleeding did not change.
conclusion: upa is effective and well-tolerated for ec
48–120 hours after upsi (level of evidence ii).
– glasier et al. [14] compared the efficacy and safety of upa with
lng for ec.
methods: women with regular menstrual cycles who
presented to a participating family planning clinic requesting
ec within 5 days of upsi were eligible for enrolment in this
randomised, multicentre, non-inferiority trial. 2221 women were
randomly assigned to receive a single, supervised dose of 30 mg
upa (n ¼ 1104) or 1.5 mg lng (n ¼ 1117) orally. follow-up was
done 5–7 days after expected onset of next menses. the primary
endpoint was pregnancy rate in women who received ec within

emergency contraception

9

72 h of upsi, with a non-inferiority margin of 1% point difference
between groups (limit of 1.6 for odds ratio). analysis was done on
the efficacy-evaluable population, which excluded women lost to
follow-up, those aged over 35 years, women with unknown
follow-up pregnancy status, and those who had re-enrolled in the
study. additionally, we undertook a meta-analysis of our trial and
an earlier study to assess the efficacy of upa compared with
lng.
results: in the efficacy-evaluable population, 1696 women
received ec within 72 h of upsi (upa, n ¼ 844; lng, n ¼ 852).
there were 15 pregnancies in the upa group (1.8%, 95% ci 1.0–
3.0) and 22 in the lng group (2.6%, 1.7–3.9; odds ratio [or]
0.68, 95% ci 0.35–1.31). in 203 women who received ec
between 72 h and 120 h after upsi, there were three pregnancies,
all of which were in the lng group.
in the meta-analysis (0–72 h), there were 22 (1.4%) pregnancies in 1617 women in the upa group and 35 (2.2%) in 1625
women in the lng group (or 0.58, 0.33–0.99; p ¼ 0.046).
conclusion: upa provides women and health-care providers
with an effective alternative for ec that can be used up to 5 days
after upsi.
analysis of the complete study data
even if the complete data set of [14,37] shows only a trend in
favour for upa versus lng, the pooled data analysis (called
metaanalysis) [14] pooled with [37] shows a significant odds ratio
(upa/lng) in favour of upa compared to lng (table 4).
contraceptive efficacy by time after upsi (table 4):
lng: slight increase up to 2.80% during 49–72 hours in [37],
whereas no change over up to 5 days in [14], with low number of
subjects in the time window 73–96 and 97–120 hours.
upa: in [37] study no pregnancy within 0–24 hours, 2.2%
within 25–48 and 0.4% within 49–72 hours. no data above 72
hours. fine et al. [38] starting after 72 hours, showed a decline in
pregnancy rate from 2.3% (49–72 hours), over 2.1% (73–96 hours)
to 1.3% (97–120 hours) with decreasing number of subjects; no
data if the difference is of statistical relevance.
in [14] trial. there are no real difference within the first 72
hours, but no pregnancy occurred thereafter. after 72 hours the
groups are small and there might be a selection bias for
recruitment of subjects after 72 hours.
due to the fact, that the metaanalysis of glasier is in reality a
combined data analysis of two different studies (even if 50 mg
upa equals 30 mg micronized upa) (different selection criteria
of subjects - see table) the final results must be interpreted with
caution.
analysis of subsets of data (table 4)
two clinical trials (phase ii: 50 mg unmicronized upa versus
1.5 mg lng as a single dose [37]; phase iii: 30 mg micronized
 xxxd3466xxx  versus 1.5 mg lng [14] saw the examination of women
who used ec between 0 and 72 hours or 0 and 120 hours after
upsi or contraceptive failure. the results of both trials showed
that upa was not inferior for the purpose of ec compared to
lng. the third trial [38] revealed pregnancy rates of 2.1%
for upa versus the expected pregnancies of 5.5% (figure 7 and 8).
a pre-planned pooled data analysis combining the data of the
two comparative trials eventually established superiority of
upa over lng. compared to lng upa was able to reduce the
risk of pregnancy to almost one half if given up to 120 hours after
upsi. a reduction of the pregnancy rate by almost two thirds
compared to lng was observed when given within 24 hours
after upsi implying the recommendation that upa should be
taken as soon as possible after an upsi [14].

factors influencing ec efficacy
in the meta-analysis by glasier et al. [14] on lng versus upa
factors associated with ec failure were analyzed. body mass index
(bmi) had the most significant impact on risk for pregnancy where
this risk was more than 3 times greater for women with bmi 30 and
above, compared with women with bmi under 25 with any of the
ec methods. the effect of bmi on pregnancy rate was more
pronounced in women treated with lng than upa. the efficacy of
lng decreased rapidly with increasing bmi and the analysis
showed no difference from pregnancy rates expected among
women not using ec at a bmi of 26 if treated with lng compared
to bmi 35 if treated with upa. when weight instead of bmi was a
covariate in analyses the limit of efficacy was reached at 70 kg for
lng compared with 88 kg in women having taken upa. other
significant factors found to influence pregnancy risk were the
cycle-day of upsi, with the highest risk on the day before
ovulation, and also if further acts of upsi occurred after the intake
of ec (table 5). no significant differences between the treatment
groups (lng versus upa) were observed on these effects on
pregnancy risk [14] (table 6). the observed high risk of ec failure

at intercourse at the time of ovulation is consitent with the
mechanism of action with no action of ec after ovulation has
occurred.

copper iud
copper is toxic to the ovum and sperm and thus the copperbearing intrauterine device is effective immediately after insertion
and works primarily by inhibiting fertilisation [45a,45b,46].
a systematic review on mechanisms of action of iuds showed
that both pre- and postfertilisation effects contribute to efficacy.
if fertilisation has already occurred, it is accepted that there is an
anti-implantation effect [47,48].
the use of copper iud for ec is an ‘‘off-label’’ use;
nevertheless in the uk this option is taken by 15% of ec-users
[49], especially due to the high contraceptive efficacy (499%) and
when long term contraception is preferred.
there are several clinical trials analyzing the contraceptive
potential of copper iud for ec [50–54]. to avoid uterine
infections vaginal and cervical infections must be excluded and
according to parity, the phase of the menstrual cycle a cervical
dilatation might be necessary. furthermore the type of copper
iud must be selected.
the smallest one is actually the frameless copper iud,
gynefixõ (contrel, belgium: www.wildemeersch.com), according to a personal information by the inventor d. wildemeersch
[55]. it can be used for ec [56]. unfortunately the small gf200
should have been used but didn’t exist at that time. the small
gf200 is the standard for all normal uteri (58.5 cm sound length);
its registered for ec use in the european union. other iuds with
registration for ec are multiload-cu 250 (ce), multiload-cu 375
(ce) and multiload-cu 375 sl (ce). use of iuds without this
registered indication for use as ec is ‘‘off-label’’.
the main disadvantage of iud that is an invasive procedure,
and it is required trained providers and sterilized facilities.
cochrane analysis
in a cochrane analysis cheng et al. [13] analysed trials of
postcoital contraception, looking at 100 trials enrolling a total
number of 55 666 women. most of these trials, i.e. 86 out of 100,
were done in china.
mifepristone: meta-analysis indicated that mid-dose mifepristone (25–50 mg) (20 trials; rr 0.64; 95% ci 0.45 to 0.92) or
low-dose mifepristone (525 mg) (11 trials; rr 0.70; 95% ci 0.50
to 0.97) were significantly more effective than lng, but the
significance was marginal when only high-quality studies were
included (4 trials; rr 0.70; 95% ci 0.49 to 1.01). low-dose
mifepristone was less effective than mid-dose mifepristone (25
trials; rr 0.73; 95% ci 0.55 to 0.97). this difference was not
statistically significant when only high-quality trials were considered (6 trials; rr 0.75; 95% ci 0.50 to 1.10). mifepristone
(all doses) (3 trials; rr 0.14; 95% ci 0.05 to 0.41) were more
effective than the yuzpe regimen in preventing pregnancy.
levonorgestrel: single-dose lng (1.5 mg) showed similar
effectiveness as the standard two-dose regimen (0.75 mg 12 h
apart) (3 trials; rr 0.84; 95% ci 0.53 to 1.33). this conclusion
was not modified by the time elapsed from intercourse to
treatment administration. lng (5 trials; rr 0.54; 95% ci 0.36 to
0.80) were more effective than the yuzpe regimen in preventing
pregnancy.
 xxxd3466xxx  acetate appeared more effective (2 trials; rr 0.63)
than lng at a marginal level (p ¼ 0.09) within 72 hours
of intercourse. regarding effectiveness in relation to the time of
administration, women who took lng within 72 hours of
intercourse were significantly less likely to be pregnant than
those who took it after 72 hours (4 trials; rr 0.51; 95% ci 0.31 to

11

0.84). it was not evident that the coitus-treatment time affected
the effectiveness of mifepristone and upa. single-dose lng
(1.5 mg) showed similar effectiveness as the standard two-dose
regimen (0.75 mg 12 h apart) (3 trials; rr 0.84; 95% ci 0.53 to
1.33). this conclusion was not modified by the time elapsed from
intercourse to treatment administration. mifepristone (all doses)
(3 trials; rr 0.14; 95% ci 0.05 to 0.41) and lng (5 trials; rr
0.54; 95% ci 0.36 to 0.80) were more effective than the yuzpe
regimen in preventing pregnancy.
gestrinone: one trial compared gestrinone with mifepristone.
no significant difference of effectiveness was identified in this
trial (996 women; rr 0.75; 95% ci 0.32 to 1.76).
all methods of ec were safe. nausea and vomiting occurred
with oestrogen-containing ec methods and progestogen and antiprogestogen methods caused changes in subsequent menses. lng
users were more likely to have a menstrual return before the
expected date, but upa users were more likely to have a
menstrual return after the expected date. menstrual delay was the
main adverse effect of mifepristone and seemed to be doserelated.
conclusion: intermediate-dose mifepri-stone (25–50 mg) was
superior to lng and yuzpe regimens. mifepristone low dose
(525 mg) may be more effective than lng (0.75 mg two doses),
but this was not conclusive. upa may be more effective
than lng. lng proved to be more effective than the yuzpe
regimen. the copper iud was the most effective ec method and
was the only ec method to provide ongoing contraception if left
in situ.

summary
1. mifepristone
cochrane conclusions [13]:
– intermediate-dose mifepristone (25–50 mg) was superior to
lng and yuzpe regimens. mifepristone low dose (525 mg) may
be more effective than lng (0.75 mg two doses), but this was not
conclusive.
– it was not evident that the coitus-treatment time affected the
effectiveness of mifepristone.
contraceptive failure: about 1.5% for 10 and 25 mg mifepristone up to 5 days after upsi.
2. levonorgestrel
lng 1.5 mg (single dose) is effective as postcoital contraceptives
up to 5 days [57].
cochrane conclusions [13]:
– lng proved to be more effective than the yuzpe regimen.
– regarding effectiveness in relation to the time of administration,
women who took lng within 72 hours of intercourse were
significantly less likely to be pregnant than those who took it after
72 hours (4 trials; rr 0.51; 95% ci 0.31 to 0.84).
contraceptive failure: about 3%.

4.  xxxd3466xxx  acetate
there are no clinical data demonstrating that the contraceptive
efficacy of upa declines by time elapsed after upsi up to 5 days
after upsi.
cochrane conclusions [13]: it was not evident that the coitustreatment time affected the effectiveness of upa.
looking a specific subsets of data is situation is a little bit
different:
– viceversa fine et al. [38]. and glasier et al. [14]. showed lower
pregnancy rate after 72 hours than in the time window before. the
low (zero) pregnancy rate in [14]. studies may depend on bias
(knowledge that early use is better than late use) and small
number of subjects are these data should not be overestimated.
– comparing the time frame from 25–48 hours to less than 24
hours both creinin et al. [37] and glasier et al. [14]. showed a
lower pregnancy rate for the early use of upa - but no statistical
significance is given for this observation.
contraceptive failure: about 1.5%.
use of upa as early as possible - is there a clinical need?
depending on the long existing knowledge from earlier ec
studies such as [18] indicating that emergency contraceptives
should be used as early as possible, there is an upcoming
discussion to use upa as early as possible to prevent preovulatory
follicular growth and suppress ovulation - even this hypothesis is
not supported by any clinical trial and also cheng et al. [13] did
not see that coitus-treatment time affected the effectiveness of
upa. however in the metaanalysis by glasier et al it is clear that
if used within 24 hours form the upsi upa was three times as
effective as lng and thereafter twice as effective. for practical
and efficacy reasons it is therefore important to advise women to
use ecp as soon as possible (see also [13]).
ideally they should be provided with pills in advance or ec
pills should be available otc. it is also important to remember
that - if possible - the cu-iud is the most effective ec method
probably because it acts both to prevent fertilization but also to
prevent implantation, but worldwide insertion of a copper iud is
‘‘off label’’, not for the small copper chain-iud gynfixõ
(contrel/belgium) in the european union. at present all
european countries except germany and swizerland have lng
available otc. hopefully upa will also be available in short.
if the woman vomits within three hours of taking the medicine
she should take another tablet. upa (ellaoneõ ) can be taken at
any time during the menstrual cycle. possible drug interactions
must be considered (see smpc).
resume or initiate contraception?
the question when can a women resume or initiate contraception
after taking emergency contraceptive pills is addressed in a
systematic review by salcedo et al. [58]. the drug manufacturer
advises continuation or initiation of routine contraception as soon
as possible after use of upa, with concomitant use of a reliable
barrier method until next menses. however, a theoretical concern
exists that given upa’s function as a selective progesterone
receptor modulator, coadministration of a progestin could decrease
its effectiveness as an emergency contraceptive. initiation of
hormonal contraception following lng or the yuzpe regimen for
ec carries no similar concern for decreased method effectiveness.

gynecol endocrinol, 2013; 29(s1): 1–14

contraceptive failure: less than 0.1%.
iud insertion might not be acceptable for every patient.
furthermore iud-insertion is an invasive procedure and it is
required trained providers and sterilized facilities.
the insertion of an copper iud is an ‘‘off-label’’ procedure;
only the small copper chain gynefix iud (can be also used for
nullipara) is registered in the european community for ec. other
iuds with registration for ec are multiload-cu 250 (ce),
multiload-cu 375 (ce) and multiload 375 sl (ce). use of iuds
without this registered indication for use as ec is ‘‘off-label’’.

6. clinical conclusions
ec is the only method that women can use after having sexual
intercourse without contraceptive protection to avoid becoming
pregnant. it could be a powerful instrument to prevent unwanted
pregnancies if widely available and acceptable. however it should
be pointed out that ec is not as effective as regular birth control
methods.
mifepristone offers a high contraceptive efficay when used for
ec in a dosage of 25 mg as a single dosage. there is a low side
effect profile. the product is mainly available in china - in most
other countries the product is not on the market due to potential
abortifacient action.
the market launch of upa (ellaoneõ ) in september 2009
allows for an effective, and safe method of postcoital contraception. upa is a first-in-class  xxxg1737xxx  modulator
specifically developed for ec. it has been demonstrated to be
highly efficacious versus lng for intake within 24 hours as well
as for intake up to 72 hours after upsi. furthermore, upa
maintains its efficacy up to 5 days after upsi, matching the
survival time of sperms. upa 30 mg is as well-tolerated as lng.
therefore upa represents a veritable breakthrough in ec
technology with a clear-cut medical advantage over lng.
although the main mechanism of action of both lng and upa
is preventing follicular rupture and ovulation the ‘window of
effect’ for lng seems to be rather narrow, beginning after
selection of the dominant follicle, and ending when lh begins to
rise. in contrast, upa has been demonstrated to have a direct
inhibitory effect on follicular rupture. this allows upa to be
effective even when administered shortly before ovulation when
the lh surge has already started to rise, a time period when use of
lng is no longer effective. the differences in mechanisms of
action explain the higher efficacy demonstrated for upa to
prevent pregnancy for both early and late use of ec.
nevertheless patients must be informed about the risk
becoming pregnant using the different hormonal methods and
that the ‘‘off label’’ use of an copper iud would provide the
highest (499%) contraceptive efficacy.
