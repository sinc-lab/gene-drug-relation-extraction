 xxxd2996xxx  ( xxxd2996xxx ), the major precursor of androgens  xxxd2996xxx  estrogens, has several beneficial effects on the immune
system, on memory function,  xxxd2996xxx  in modulating the effects of
diabetes, obesity,  xxxd2996xxx  chemical carcinogenesis. treatment of rats
with  xxxd2996xxx  influences expression of cytochrome p450 (p450)
genes, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ␣
(ppar␣)-  xxxd2996xxx   xxxg1598xxx  ( xxxg1598xxx )-mediated induction of
cyp4as  xxxd2996xxx  cyp3a23,  xxxd2996xxx  suppression of cyp2c11.  xxxd2996xxx  treatment elevated the expression  xxxd2996xxx  activities of cyp3a4, cyp2c9,
cyp2c19,  xxxd2996xxx   xxxg583xxx  in primary cultures of human hepatocytes.
induction of cyp3a4 in human hepatocytes was consistent with
studies in rats, but induction of cyp2cs was unexpected. the role
of  xxxg1598xxx  in this response was studied in transient transfection assays.  xxxd2996xxx  activated hpxr in a concentration-dependent manner.
because  xxxg583xxx  induction by  xxxd2996xxx  in human hepatocytes might

involve either  xxxg1598xxx  or  xxxg1599xxx  (car) activation, we performed experiments in primary hepatocytes from
car knockout mice  xxxd2996xxx  observed that car was required for
maximal induction of cyp2b10 by  xxxd2996xxx . furthermore, car-mediated cyp2b10 induction by  xxxd2996xxx  was inhibited by the inverse
agonist of car, androstanol (5␣-androstan-3␣-ol). further evidence for car activation was provided by cytoplasmic/nuclear
transfer of car upon  xxxd2996xxx  treatment. elucidation of car activation  xxxd2996xxx  subsequent induction of  xxxg583xxx  by  xxxd2996xxx  presented an
additional mechanism by which the sterol can modify the expression of p450s. the effect of  xxxd2996xxx  on the activation of the xenosensors ppar␣,  xxxg1598xxx ,  xxxd2996xxx  car,  xxxd2996xxx  the consequent potential for
adverse drug/toxicant interactions should be considered in humans treated with this nutriceutical agent.

 xxxd2996xxx  ( xxxd2996xxx ), the major secretory product of
the adrenal cortex, is the most abundant steroid in humans  xxxd2996xxx  has
multifunctional properties: it is a precursor of sex steroid hormones
 xxxd2996xxx  a peroxisome proliferator at pharmacological dosages (wu et al.,
1989).  xxxd2996xxx  is derived from cholesterol via a series of steps catalyzed by cytochrome p450 (p450) enzymes (miller, 2002). physio-

logical concentrations of  xxxd2996xxx   xxxd2996xxx  its sulfate derivative in human
plasma are in the micromolar range  xxxd2996xxx  increase significantly in
individuals consuming high amounts of  xxxd2996xxx  (legrain et al., 2000).
it is secreted primarily  xxxd79xxx   xxxd1710xxx ␤-sulfate conjugate ( xxxd2996xxx / xxxd2996xxx -sulfate
ratio 1:250 or 1:500 in plasma), which is taken up by target tissues  xxxd2996xxx 
hydrolyzed by sulfatases back to  xxxd2996xxx  (labrie et al., 1997; webb et
al., 2006).  xxxd2996xxx  is further metabolized to androgens  xxxd2996xxx  estrogens in
testis  xxxd2996xxx  ovary (labrie et al., 2005), or to hydroxylated metabolites
in the liver.  xxxd2996xxx  is hydroxylated to 7␣/␤-hydroxy- or 16␣-hydroxymetabolites by microsomal p450 enzymes (miller et al., 2004; chalbot  xxxd2996xxx  morfin, 2005). some of the hydroxylated metabolites are
further oxidized to oxo-derivatives (fitzpatrick et al., 2001; miller et
al., 2004).
 xxxd2996xxx  has been suggested to display beneficial effects in humans
including reduced serum cholesterol, lower incidence of cardiovascular disease, weight loss,  xxxd2996xxx  improved control of plasma glucose in

purchased from biomol research laboratories (plymouth meeting, pa).
chemicals for hepatocyte isolation, cell culture media,  xxxd2996xxx  supplements were
purchased from sigma chemie gmbh  xxxd2996xxx  merck (darmstadt, germany).
isolation  xxxd2996xxx  culture of human hepatocytes. human livers were obtained from kidney transplant donors at the transplantation  xxxd2996xxx  surgical
clinic, semmelweis university (budapest, hungary). permission of the hungarian regional committee of science  xxxd2996xxx  research ethics was obtained to
use human tissues. clinical histories of the donors are shown in table 1. liver
cells were isolated by the method of bayliss  xxxd2996xxx  skett (1996). hepatocytes
having viability better than 90% as determined by trypan blue exclusion were
used in the experiments. the cells were plated at a density of 1.7 ⫻ 105
cells/cm2 in plastic dishes precoated with collagen in medium described by
ferrini et al. (1998). after overnight culture, the medium was replaced by
serum-free medium. forty-eight hours after serum deprivation, cells were
cultured in the presence or absence of inducers for 48 h. hepatocytes were
treated with dexamethasone (1  xxxd2996xxx  10 ␮m),  xxxd2996xxx  (50 ␮m), 7␣-hydroxydhea (50 ␮m), or 7-oxo- xxxd2996xxx  (50 ␮m).
preparation  xxxd2996xxx  culture of primary mouse hepatocytes. the first
breeding pair of car knockout c57bl/6j mice was a generous gift of d. d.
moore from the department of molecular  xxxd2996xxx  cellular biology, baylor college of medicine (houston, texas) (wei et al., 2000). further breeding of car
knockout mice was carried out at the biozentrum, university of basel (basel,
switzerland). primary hepatocytes of control (car⫹/⫹)  xxxd2996xxx  car knockout
(car⫺/⫺) mice were prepared by a two-step collagenase method (bayliss
 xxxd2996xxx  skett, 1996). liver cells were plated at a density of 3 ⫻ 105 cells/well on
12-well plates coated with collagen  xxxd2996xxx  maintained in medium described by
ferrini et al. (1998). hepatocytes were exposed to tcpobop (10 ␮m),  xxxd2996xxx 
(25 ␮m), or vehicle (dmso 0.1%) for 24 h.
p450 enzyme assays. microsomal fraction from cultured human hepatocytes was prepared by differential centrifugation (van der hoeven  xxxd2996xxx  coon,
1974). protein content of microsomes was determined by the method of lowry
et al. (1951), with bovine  xxxg124xxx  as the standard. published methods
were followed to determine selective p450 enzyme activities:  xxxd2568xxx 
n-demethylation for  xxxg583xxx  (heyn et al., 1996),  xxxd3394xxx  4-hydroxylation for cyp2c9 (miners  xxxd2996xxx  birkett, 1996),  xxxd2568xxx  4⬘-hydroxylation
for cyp2c19 (srivastava et al., 1991), nifedipine oxidation (guengerich et al.,
1986),  xxxd2996xxx  midazolam 1⬘-  xxxd2996xxx  4-hydroxylation (kronbach et al., 1989) for
cyp3a4/5. the incubation mixture contained nadph-generating system (1
mm nadph, 10 mm  xxxd1292xxx , 5 mm mgcl2,  xxxd2996xxx  2 units/ml
 xxxg825xxx ), microsomes,  xxxd2996xxx  various selective substrates for p450 forms ( xxxd2568xxx ,  xxxd3394xxx , midazolam, or nifedipine).
the rates of enzyme activity were linearly dependent upon the amount of
microsomal protein added for the 10- to 30-min incubation period. the
metabolic extraction procedures  xxxd2996xxx  high-performance liquid chromatography

patients with diabetes (kawano et al., 2003; villareal  xxxd2996xxx  holloszy,
2004).  xxxd2996xxx  also protects against chemically induced carcinogenesis
(lubet et al., 1998)  xxxd2996xxx  certain immune deficiencies (henderson et al.,
1992) in animal models. furthermore,  xxxd2996xxx  has been documented to
be a neuroactive steroid displaying neuroprotective  xxxd2996xxx  memoryenchancing effects (baulieu et al., 2000). in addition to these beneficial effects, chronic administration of  xxxd2996xxx  at high doses to rodents
stimulates several pathophysiological changes such as hepatomegaly
 xxxd2996xxx  hepatocellular carcinoma (rao et al., 1992).
 xxxd2996xxx  administration to rats at supraphysiological doses has
been reported to increase the expression of several genes including
cyp4as, cyp3as, nadph: xxxg569xxx  oxidoreductase, catalase, or fatty acyl-coa oxidase (wu et al., 1989; prough et al.,
1994; webb et al., 1996; gu et al., 2003). several drugs including
 xxxd1724xxx   xxxd2996xxx  nafenopin also induce cyp4a transcription by activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ␣ (ppar␣).
although induction of cyp4a expression by  xxxd2996xxx  requires activation of ppar␣,  xxxd2996xxx  does not appear to be a ligand for ppar␣
(prough et al., 1994; peters et al., 1996). receptor activation is
possibly the result of an effect of phosphorylation status of ppar␣
(webb et al., 2006). furthermore, studies with primary cultures of
rat hepatocytes revealed that several oxidative metabolites of
 xxxd2996xxx  produced in liver are also able to activate cyp4a message
 xxxd2996xxx  protein levels (webb et al., 1996). 7-oxidized metabolites
(7-hydroxy- xxxd2996xxx   xxxd2996xxx  7-oxo- xxxd2996xxx ) do not serve as ligands for
ppar␣, but they are presumed to activate ppar␣ in a way similar
to that of the parent compound. treatment of rats with pharmacological doses of  xxxd2996xxx  results in alteration in expression of other
genes responsive to peroxisome proliferators, including fatty acylcoa oxidase or malic enzyme.  xxxd2996xxx  exerts regulatory effects not
only on peroxisome proliferation-associated genes, but also on
cyp3a23 gene in rats (singleton et al., 1999). this observation
was due to  xxxd2996xxx  activation of the  xxxg1598xxx  ( xxxg1598xxx ), a
member of the nuclear receptor superfamily known to mediate
induction of  xxxg590xxx  expression (jones et al., 2000; ripp et al.,
2002). negative regulation of cyp2c11 expression by peroxisome
proliferators has also been demonstrated in rats, although with
 xxxd2996xxx , ppar␣ coexpression does not seem to be required for
negative regulation (ripp et al., 2003). the main goal of the
present study was to examine the p450-inducing capacity of  xxxd2996xxx 
 xxxd2996xxx  of two of its metabolites (7␣-hydroxy- xxxd2996xxx   xxxd2996xxx  7-oxodhea) in primary culture of human hepatocytes. in addition to
 xxxg1598xxx  action, we provided evidence for a role of  xxxg1599xxx  (car) in the induction of certain p450 genes by
 xxxd2996xxx .

results
previous work has clearly demonstrated the p450-inducing effect of  xxxd2996xxx  in rats (prough et al., 1994; singleton et al., 1999;
gu et al., 2003). work by peters et al. (1996)  xxxd2996xxx  ripp et al. (2002)
has shown that  xxxd2996xxx  acts on cyp4as  xxxd2996xxx  cyp3a23 at the
transcriptional level by ppar␣-  xxxd2996xxx   xxxg1598xxx -mediated events, respectively. oxidative metabolites of  xxxd2996xxx  have also been reported to
activate ppar␣  xxxd2996xxx  consequently to induce cyp4a in rat hepatocytes (webb et al., 2006). the present study further characterizes
the actions of  xxxd2996xxx   xxxd2996xxx  of some of its metabolites, 7␣-hydroxydhea  xxxd2996xxx  7-oxo- xxxd2996xxx  (miller et al., 2004; chalbot  xxxd2996xxx  morfin,
2005), to induce p450s in adult human hepatocytes. we also

analysis of the results was carried out using a two-tailed t test with p ⬍ 0.05
as the criterion for significance. due to high variation in basic p450 activities
of human hepatocytes, the entire experiment was repeated in hepatocytes
isolated from five to six donors to confirm the results.
rna extraction  xxxd2996xxx  quantitative rt-pcr. total rna was isolated
from human  xxxd2996xxx  mouse hepatocytes using trizol reagent (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). ten million liver cells were homogenized in 1 ml of trizol reagent,
 xxxd2996xxx  total rna was extracted according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the
rna was precipitated using ethanol  xxxd2996xxx  stored at ⫺80°c for further analyses.
the primers used for rt-pcr analyses are shown in table 2. rna (3 ␮g) was
reverse-transcribed into single-stranded cdna using transcriptor first strand
cdna synthesis kit (roche diagnostics gmbh, mannheim, germany),  xxxd2996xxx 
then real-time pcr with human cdna was performed using faststart

switzerland) using amplitaq dna polymerase (taqman universal pcr
master mix, no amperase ung, applied biosystems, foster city, ca). the
quantity of target rna relative to that of housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ) was determined. p450 mrna levels
were quantified by rt-pcr measurements in the same human hepatocytes in
which p450 activities were measured. statistical analysis of the results obtained by rt-pcr was carried out in a manner similar to that of p450
activities.

50 ␮m)  xxxd2996xxx  7-oxo- xxxd2996xxx  (oxo- xxxd2996xxx , 50 ␮m). cyp3a4 activities were determined in microsomes prepared from hepatocytes isolated from five donors. levels
of cyp3a4 mrna in human hepatocytes (n ⫽ 5 donors) were quantified  xxxd2996xxx 
normalized to  xxxg861xxx  as described under materials  xxxd2996xxx  methods. statistical
analysis of the results obtained in untreated  xxxd2996xxx  treated cells indicated significant
increase in both the activities  xxxd2996xxx  mrna levels of cyp3a4 as a consequence of
various treatments. controls for each independent experiment were assigned values

treatment or  xxxg1598xxx  activation by  xxxd2996xxx  is responsible for  xxxg583xxx 
induction. hepatocytes isolated from car knockout  xxxd2996xxx  wild-type
mice were tested for their responsiveness to  xxxd2996xxx . rt-pcr analysis
of rna prepared from hepatocytes of wild-type mice revealed a
substantial increase (approximately 8-fold) in mrna of the mouse
ortholog cyp2b10 as a result of  xxxd2996xxx  treatment compared with
vehicle-treated controls (fig. 4). mouse hepatocytes from wild-type
animals exhibited strong induction of cyp2b10 (approximately 20fold) after exposure to the mouse car activator tcpobop (10 ␮m).
lack of expression of car in hepatocytes from car-ablated mice
resulted in abolition of cyp2b10 induction by tcpobop. although
the induction of cyp2b10 expression by  xxxd2996xxx  was also reduced in
primary hepatocytes of car knockout mice, it was not completely
inhibited. approximately 4-fold induction of cyp2b10 by  xxxd2996xxx  was

reference compound at relatively high concentrations (1  xxxd2996xxx  10 ␮m).
at supramicromolar concentrations, dexamethasone binds to  xxxd2996xxx  activates  xxxg1598xxx , producing induction of p450s such as cyp3a4 (pascussi
et al., 2001). p450 enzyme activities  xxxd2996xxx  mrna levels were determined in primary human hepatocytes isolated from several donors (as
indicated in figs. 1  xxxd2996xxx  2) because of high individual variance in basic
activities or p450 expression of the cells. to evaluate significant
inducibility of human hepatocytes by  xxxd2996xxx   xxxd2996xxx  its metabolites, a
paired t test was performed with p ⬍ 0.05 as the criterion for
significance. figures 1  xxxd2996xxx  2 present p450 activities  xxxd2996xxx  mrna levels
relative to untreated hepatocytes (0.1% dmso-treated cells).
nifedipine oxidation,  xxxd2996xxx  midazolam 1⬘-  xxxd2996xxx  4-hydroxylation activities of cyp3a4 increased by 3- to 4-fold in dexamethasonetreated cells as expected from the work of others (ledirac et al., 2000).
treatments with  xxxd2996xxx  or its metabolites resulted in a more than
2-fold induction of cyp3a4 activities (fig. 1a). the elevation in
enzyme activities was nearly concomitant with the -fold changes in
levels of cyp3a4 mrna (fig. 1b). treatments of hepatocytes with
 xxxd2996xxx  or its two oxidative metabolites produced nearly identical
increases in enzyme activities or mrna levels of cyp3a4. these
results suggested that  xxxd2996xxx   xxxd2996xxx  its metabolites caused transcriptional activation of cyp3a4 gene involving the action of nuclear
receptors, most likely of  xxxg1598xxx .
 xxxd3394xxx  hydroxylation activity  xxxd2996xxx  expression of cyp2c9
were also significantly induced by  xxxd2996xxx   xxxd2996xxx  two of its metabolites
(fig. 2a). the degree of the elevation of cyp2c9 activity  xxxd2996xxx  mrna
levels relative to the control cell population (2- to 3-fold) was identical with that of dexamethasone-treated cells. similar results were
observed for cyp2c19.  xxxd2996xxx  treatment caused an appreciable 2- to
3-fold increase in  xxxd2568xxx  4-hydroxylation activity  xxxd2996xxx  mrna
levels of cyp2c19 (fig. 2b). the two oxidative metabolites of  xxxd2996xxx 
also exerted the same cyp2c19-inducing effect as the parent compound. furthermore,  xxxd2568xxx  n-demethylation activity of
 xxxg583xxx  was potently induced by  xxxd2996xxx   xxxd2996xxx  its metabolites (fig.
2c). nearly identical increases in  xxxg583xxx  activity were obtained in
liver cells treated with  xxxd2996xxx , 7␣-hydroxy- xxxd2996xxx ,  xxxd2996xxx  7-oxo- xxxd2996xxx .
the 48-h treatment resulted in an approximately 2- or 2.5-fold increase similar to that of dexamethasone. similar effects were observed
at the level of  xxxg583xxx  mrna (fig. 2c).
 xxxg1598xxx  activation by  xxxd2996xxx .  xxxd2996xxx  is known to induce expression
of cyp4as through activation of ppar␣. it is also an activator of
 xxxg1598xxx  that mediates induction of cyp3a23 expression in rats (ripp et
al., 2002). it has been demonstrated that  xxxg1598xxx  is involved in regulation
of the expression of several p450s ( xxxg583xxx , cyp2c9, cyp2c19,
 xxxd2996xxx  cyp3a4) in human (pascussi et al., 2001, 2003b). our results in
human hepatocytes also suggested that  xxxd2996xxx  transcriptionally activated p450 genes involving the action of  xxxg1598xxx . to assess whether
 xxxd2996xxx  was able to activate human  xxxg1598xxx , transient cotransfection
assay was performed in the huh7 cell line. the effect of  xxxd2996xxx  on
transcriptional activation of hpxr was investigated using reporter
plasmid ( xxxg2041xxx (cyp3a4/xrem[⫺7800/⫺7200]/⫺262/⫹11)luc).
the reporter plasmid was cotransfected with hpxr.  xxxd2996xxx  treatment
resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in ligand-induced
transactivation of reporter construct by hpxr (fig. 3). however, the
3-fold induction observed at 50 ␮m  xxxd2996xxx  was lower than the
increase in luciferase activity caused by the well known  xxxg1598xxx  agonist
 xxxd1380xxx  (jones et al., 2000). it should be noted that  xxxd2996xxx  was able
to slightly activate reporter plasmid without coexpression of hpxr to
some extent (1.8-fold).
the role of car in  xxxg583xxx  induction. the finding that  xxxd2996xxx 
was active in  xxxg583xxx  induction in human hepatocytes raised the
question of whether car activation may occur as a result of  xxxd2996xxx 

 xxxd2996xxx  induction acts through car

still present in liver cells of car⫺/⫺ mice (fig. 4). these observations clearly established that car was involved in maximal induction
of cyp2b10 by  xxxd2996xxx , suggesting that both car  xxxd2996xxx   xxxg1598xxx  may be
required for the maximal inductive effect of  xxxd2996xxx  on cyp2b10 gene
expression.
to evaluate the role of car in  xxxd2996xxx  action, the effect of androstanol on cyp2b10 induction was also investigated in mouse hepatocytes. androstanol significantly reduced the induction of cyp2b10 by
the car ligand, tcpobop. cyp2b10 mrna levels of the cells
treated with tcpobop decreased by approximately 50 to 60% in the
presence of androstanol (fig. 5). androstanol was also observed to
repress the induction of cyp2b10 by  xxxd2996xxx . androstanol treatment
decreased cyp2b10 mrna levels by 40 to 50% in  xxxd2996xxx -induced
hepatocytes. thus, androstanol, the  xxxd1422xxx  of car (forman
et al., 1998), reduced the expression of cyp2b10 both in  xxxd2996xxx -  xxxd2996xxx 
in tcpobop-induced cells.
the capability of  xxxd2996xxx  to trigger car translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus was also tested in mouse primary hepatocytes
expressing human car. the subcellular localization of hcar was
determined by fluorescence microscopy in hepatocytes infected with
plasmid coding for hcar in fusion with enhanced green fluorescent
protein (pegfp-c1-hcar). in control hepatocytes, hcar-gfp was
clearly located in the cytoplasm, whereas it was undetectable in the
nuclei in the absence of stimulation (fig. 6). after 4 h exposure to the
selective human car agonist citco (maglich et al., 2003), cytoplasmic/nuclear transfer of car was observed primarily in nuclei of
the cells, as expected. in response to  xxxd2996xxx  treatment, the pattern of
car-gfp localization was similar to that seen after citco treatment
(fig. 6). the corresponding dapi-stained  xxxd2996xxx  merged images provided further visual evidence indicating that  xxxd2996xxx  promoted efficient car translocation into the nucleus of hepatocytes.

discussion
 xxxd2996xxx  administration to rats affects the expression of several p450
genes.  xxxd2996xxx  has been shown to increase the levels of cyp4as
(prough et al., 1994)  xxxd2996xxx  cyp3a23 (singleton et al., 1999),  xxxd2996xxx  to
suppress the expression of cyp2c11 (ripp et al., 2003). nuclear
receptors such as ppar␣  xxxd2996xxx   xxxg1598xxx  appear to be involved in  xxxd2996xxx 
action in rats (peters et al., 1996; ripp et al., 2002). in addition,
7-oxidized metabolites of  xxxd2996xxx  also induce cyp4a1 message  xxxd2996xxx 
protein levels in rat hepatocytes contributing to the effect of the parent
compound (webb et al., 2006). in the present study, we therefore
investigated the induction of p450s by  xxxd2996xxx   xxxd2996xxx  two of its oxidative
metabolites in primary cultures of human hepatocytes  xxxd2996xxx , in particular, the role of nuclear receptors  xxxg1598xxx   xxxd2996xxx  car in  xxxd2996xxx  action.
human hepatocytes in culture as induction system were validated
by testing the classical inducer compound, the steroid dexamethasone,
on p450 gene expression. concentrations of dexamethasone equal to
or above 1 ␮m potently increased both the activities  xxxd2996xxx  mrna

levels of cyp3a4  xxxd2996xxx , to a lesser extent, of cyp2c9, cyp2c19,  xxxd2996xxx 
 xxxg583xxx . the present study then revealed that  xxxd2996xxx  treatment also
elevated the expression  xxxd2996xxx  activities of cyp3a4, cyp2c9,
cyp2c19,  xxxd2996xxx   xxxg583xxx  similar to those of dexamethasone. in addition, the  xxxd2996xxx  metabolite 7␣-hydroxy- xxxd2996xxx  or 7-oxo- xxxd2996xxx  resulted in the same inducing action as did the parent compound. this
means that biotransformation does not lead to inactivation of  xxxd2996xxx 
as p450 inducer.
the finding that  xxxd2996xxx  potently induced cyp3a4 in human hepatocytes was consistent with previous studies in rats (singleton et al.,
1999).  xxxg1598xxx  activation has been proposed to mediate the increase in
 xxxg590xxx  expression (ripp et al., 2002). but in contrast to studies in rats
(ripp et al., 2003),  xxxd2996xxx  did not mediate suppression of cyp2cs in
human hepatocytes. moreover,  xxxd2996xxx  treatment led to up-regulation
of both cyp2c9  xxxd2996xxx  cyp2c19, suggesting the involvement of  xxxg1598xxx .
 xxxd2996xxx  was able to activate hpxr in a concentration-dependent manner, although it appeared to be a weak  xxxg1598xxx  activator compared with
the well known  xxxg1598xxx  agonist  xxxd1380xxx .
 xxxd2996xxx -mediated transcription of  xxxg583xxx  has not been unequivocally shown in previous studies. the current studies demonstrated an
efficient  xxxg583xxx  induction exerted by  xxxd2996xxx  in primary cultures of
human hepatocytes. the activation of human car by compounds
such as phenobarbital  xxxd2996xxx  citco or mouse car by tcpobop has
been well documented (maglich et al., 2003). experiments carried out
in hepatocytes of car knockout mice demonstrated that ablated
levels of car reduced, but did not abolish, response to  xxxd2996xxx . partial
inhibition of  xxxd2996xxx -mediated cyp2b10 induction by the  xxxd1422xxx  androstanol presented further evidence for the contribution of
car to the enhancement of cyp2b10 expression. the inactive nuclear
receptor car, which is cytoplasmic in hepatocytes, undergoes rapid
nuclear translocation upon treatment with car activators, phenobarbital, or citco. although binding of car activators to the receptor
may not occur, car translocation to the nucleus is the limiting step

in the car activation process, followed by car/rxr heterodimer
formation  xxxd2996xxx  binding of the proteins to the dna of target genes
(waxman, 1999). the activation of car by  xxxd2996xxx  was thus demonstrated in in vitro nuclear translocation assays. using primary
cultures of mouse hepatocytes expressing hcar, the effect of  xxxd2996xxx 
on cytoplasmic/nuclear shuttling of car was compared with that of
citco. in agreement with maglich et al. (2003), the occurrence of
translocation of hcar from cytoplasm into the nucleus after citco
treatment was well recognized.  xxxd2996xxx  treatment also induced car
translocation into the nucleus, presenting further evidence for car
activation by  xxxd2996xxx . these findings suggested that car was required
for maximal induction of cyp2b10 by  xxxd2996xxx . however, in the absence of car, there still is an apparent receptor-mediated induction of
p450 mrna, protein,  xxxd2996xxx  activity that could be due to  xxxg1598xxx  (ripp et
al., 2003) or yet unidentified transcription factors.
in conclusion, we provide evidence for the induction of several p450s
(cyp3a4, cyp2c9, cyp2c19,  xxxd2996xxx   xxxg583xxx ) by  xxxd2996xxx   xxxd2996xxx  by two of
its oxidative metabolites, 7␣-hydroxy- xxxd2996xxx   xxxd2996xxx  7-oxo- xxxd2996xxx , in human hepatocytes. our results also provide convincing evidence for the
activation of hpxr  xxxd2996xxx  hcar by  xxxd2996xxx  as prerequisite for the transcriptional activation of these p450 genes. in other studies, the activation
of several nuclear receptors including ppar␣,  xxxg1598xxx ,  xxxd2996xxx   xxxg730xxx  by  xxxd2996xxx   xxxd2996xxx  its metabolites has been demonstrated. car activation
 xxxd2996xxx  subsequent induction of  xxxg583xxx  by  xxxd2996xxx  present an additional
mechanism by which  xxxd2996xxx , a widely used nutriceutical, can modify the
expression of p450s. because the inductive response of the  xxxg1598xxx   xxxd2996xxx 
car system is associated with changes in the kinetics of numerous drugs
 xxxd2996xxx  steroids  xxxd2996xxx  includes drug-drug interactions  xxxd2996xxx  adverse drug effects,
the unrestricted use of  xxxd2996xxx  as a panacea for various health problems
should be carefully considered.
