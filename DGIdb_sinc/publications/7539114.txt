summary-previous
studies have shown that local anesthetics block voltage-dependent na+ channels and
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. the present study investigated the effect of the local anesthetic, procaine on
another ligand-gated ion channel, the s-ht, receptor, in rat nodose ganglion neurons. procaine (0.01-100 pm)
inhibited the 5-ht, receptor-mediated inward current in the whole-cell patch clamp recording. the inhibition
was fully reversible, concentration-dependent
but not sensitive to changes in membrane potential. concentration-response
curves indicated that procaine appears to produce a competitive
inhibition
on 5-ht,
receptors with a ko of 1.7 pm. these observations suggest that one of the actions of procaine in nervous
system is on 5-ht, receptors.

as a local anesthetic,
procaine
reversibly blocks the
signal conduction
along nerve axons and other excitable
membranes
and consequently
the pain sensation from
specific areas of the body (ritchie and greene, 1991).
there is convincing evidence to suggest that this effect of
procaine and of other local anesthetics is achieved by
blocking voltage-dependent
na+ channels (ritchie and
greene, 1991; butterworth
and strichartz,
1990). the
inhibition
of na+ channel
function
is voltage- and
time-dependent
and is enhanced by repetitive activation
of na+ channels (use-dependent
blockade).
in addition to its local anesthetic property, procaine
also has some behavioural
effects. when administered
in
high doses, procaine can produce general anesthesia in
humans and has been used to treat status epilepticus
(garfield and gugino,
1987). intravenous
infusion of
procaine or lidocaine may cause sleepiness, light-headedness, visual and auditory disturbances,
and restlessness
(ritchie and greene, 1991; garfield and gugino, 1987).
in some patients, procaine is believed to precipitate
a
panic attack following the injection of procaine penicillin
g (hoigne syndrome,
green et al., 1974; winter and
stickler, 1984; ilechukwu,
1990). furthermore
it was
found in the 1970s that surprisingly procaine has effects
in common with psychomotor
stimulants such as cocaine
and amphetamine
and can function
as a positive reinforcer in rhesus monkeys,
rats, and pigeons (ford

and balster, 1977; hammerbeck
and mitchell,
1977;
woolverton
and balster, 1979; johanson,
1980; zacny
and woolverton,
1989). in two human studies, procaine
and lidocaine produced some subjective effects similar to
those produced
by cocaine (van dyke et al., 1979;
fischman et ae., 1983).
the mechanisms
for the behavioural
effects of procaine are poorly understood.
obviously, it is difficult to
explain these procaine actions solely with the blockade
of na+ channels. previous studies have demonstrated
that procaine and other local anesthetics interact with
other membrane
proteins
such as the k+ and ca2+
channels and ligand-gated
ion channels (forman
and
miller, 1989a). one of these channels is the nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor. there is a whole body of evidence
indicating
that procaine
and other local anesthetics
block the opened nicotinic acetylcholine
channel (beam,
1976; adams, 1977; ruff, 1977; neher, 1983; forman
and miller, 1989a). since the procaine-induced
blockade
of nicotinic acetylcholine
channel is voltage sensitive, it
is hypothesized
that the procaine binding site is electrically half way through the channel or at least within the
membrane
electric field (adams,
1977; forman
and
miller, 1989a). 5-ht, receptor is another ligand-gated
ion channel affected by local anesthetics such as cocaine
(fan et al., 1992) and possibly also acted by procaine.
barann et al. (1993) demonstrated
that in neuroblastoma
nle-115 cells, procaine, cocaine and other local anesthetics inhibited a cation influx induced by the activation
of 5-ht, receptors.
it has also been shown that

et al., 1985) 5-ht, receptors mediate pain

of nodose ganglion

neurons

single neurons were isolated from rat nodose
ganglion. the principal procedure used has been described previously (ikeda et al., 1986), although some
minor changes were made. briefly, male, adult
sprague-dawley
rats (1.50-300 g) were sacrificed by
decapitation; the nodose ganglion was rapidly extracted
and placed in cold dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
(dmem). the nodose ganglion was then minced with
iridectomy scissors and digested in dmem containing
1.25 mg/ml collagenase (type ia), 0.8 mg/ml trypsin
(type iii) and 0.125 mg/ml deoxyribonuclease (type iv)
at 35°c for 3&45 min, after which soybean trypsin
inhibitor (sigma type iis, 1 mg/ml) was added. neurons
were then plated in petri dishes.
whole cell patch -ciamp recording

neurons were viewed using an inverted microscope
and superfused with extracellular solution at i mlimin.
the normal extracellular solution contained (in mm);
150, nacl; 5, kcl; 2.5,  xxxg2125xxx ,; 1, mgcl,; 10, hepes; 10,
r>-glucose; ph was adjusted to 7.4 with naoh. sucrose
was added to these solutions to make the osmolarity
340 mosmol/kg. experiments were performed at room
temperature (20-25°c). the whole cell version of the
patch-clamp technique was used by means of an axopatch 1d amplifier (axon instruments, inc.). unless
stated otherwise, neurons were voltage-clamped
at
- 50 mv. patch electrodes (2-5 ma) were pulled from
borosilicate glass (world precision instrument co.) and
filled with an internal solution containing (in mm): 140,
kcl; 2, mgcl, ; 1,  xxxg2125xxx , ; 11, egta; 10, hepes; 2, atp
(magnesium salt); ph was buffered to 7.4 with koh
and osmolarity to 3 10 mosmol/kg with sucrose. in
some cases, 140, cscl; 0,  xxxg2125xxx , ; and 10-30, bapta
(1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy) ethane-n,n,n’,n ‘“tetraacetic
acid) were used instead of kc1 and egta in the internal
solution; no change in kinetic properties of 5-htinduced inward current was found. neurotransmitters
and other drugs were dissolved in external solution and
applied through a fast perfusion system consisting of a
series of fused silica tubes (2~0-300 pm) glued together
and held by a micromanipulator
(narishige). these
tubes were connected to several different reservoirs
containing either control or test solutions. the neuron
under study was placed within 30-50 pm of the opening
of these tubes and cell was exposed to the desired
solution.
the tested solution

results
in agreement with the previous studies (lovinger and
white, 1991; fan et al., 1992) 5-ht induced a fast
inward current which quickly desensitized (fig. 1). this
5-ht induced inward current was sensitive to the selective 5-ht, receptor antagonist
mdl72222
[fig. l(b)].
the specific 5-ht, receptor agonists, z-methyl-serotonin
and m-chlorophenylbiguanide
produced a similar current [fig. l(a)].

up to 100 pm did not produce any detectable membrane current (data not shown). if procaine was
pre-applied for 5-15 set and then applied together with
5-ht, the inhibitory effect of procaine on 5-ht induced current was enhanced by about 20% [fig. 2(a)].
the effects of several other local anesthetics (cocaine,
tetracaine and  xxxd383xxx ) on the 5-ht current
were also shown but were not studied in detail
[fig. 2(c)]. effects of these local anesthetics were fully
reversible.
it is well established that the actions of procaine and
other local anesthetics on ion channels are sensitive to
membrane potential (forman and miller, 1989a; butterworth and strichartz, 1990; ritchie and greene, 1991).
however, in the present experiments, the inhibition of
procaine on the 5-ht current does not appear to be
voltage-dependent. figure 3 shows the current-voltage
relation curves of the 5-ht current in the absence and
presence of 1 pm procaine. each tested membrane potential was held for l-2 min to record 5-ht current and
then returned to - 50 mv. the 5-ht current reverses at
about + 13 mv and were inhibited almost identically at
all the membrane potentials tested (from -70 to
+ 35 mv). quantitative data for the effect of procaine at

different membrane potentials are given in fig. 3(b). no
significant differences were found.
the concentration-response
curve of the suppression
of 5-ht current by procaine (0.1-100 pm) was examined when different concentrations of agonist were applied [fig 4(a)]. the effect of procaine at a given
concentration could be overcome by increasing the
concentration of 5-ht. therefore, there is a rightward
parallel shift of procaine inhibition curve on 5-ht
current when 5-ht concentration was increased from 2
to 12 p m. the hill coefficients (n) and different ic,, s are
as follows: with 2 pm 5-ht, n = 0.9; ic,, = 0.61 pm;
with 12 pm 5-ht, n = 0.93; ic,, = 6.22 pm. the apparent pa, values of the procaine inhibition on 5-ht
current were obtained by the method of arunlakshana
and schild (1959). they were between 5.68 to 5.83 and
the average was 5.76 f 0.015 (n = 4). the apparent kd
is 1.7 pm. the average slope of the schild plots was
1.19 + 0.08 (n = 4). an example of such experiments is
shown in fig. 4(b and c). all the procaine concentrations used to obtain pa, values and concentrationresponse curves were pre-applied for 15 set and then
applied together with 5-ht. these data indicate that
procaine appears to act as a competitive inhibitor of
5-ht, receptor.
the effect of procaine on the 5-ht current was also
investigated when procaine was applied intracellularly

discussion

the present study demonstrated
that local anesthetics
such as procaine inhibit the 5-ht, receptor-mediated
current in rat nodose ganglion neurons. the procaineinduced inhibition was concentration-dependent
but was
not affected by membrane
potential.
intracellular
procaine had no effect on the 5-ht current. an increase of
agonist concentration
produced
a parallel shift in the
procaine concentration-response
curve.
the mechanism
for the procaine
action on 5-ht,
receptor appears different from that which blocks the

voltage-dependent
na+ channel and the nicotinic acetylcholine channel.
procaine and other local anesthetics
have a weaker effect for the rested na+ and nicotinic
acetylcholine
channels (at more negative membrane potentials) than for the opened ones (at more positive
membrane potentials, butterworth
and strichartz, 1990;
ritchie and green, 1991). for voltage-dependent
na’
channel, evidence suggests that the binding site for local
anesthetics
exists in the channel’s pore or within the
protein subunits of the channel and lies nearer to the
cytoplasmic
than the external surface of the membrane
(butterworth
and strichartz,
1990). for the nicotinic
acetylcholine
channel, there is strong evidence that local
anesthetics
occlude the opened channel (adams, 1977;
ruff, 1977; neher, 1983; forman and miller, 1989b).
binding of local anesthetics to the nicotinic acetylcholine
channels is non-competitive
(neubig ef al., 1979; lin
et al., 1990) and the binding site is within the channel
passway (adams, 1977; leonard et al., 1988; forman
and miller, 1989a). although some studies suggest that

this conclusion
is supported by the observation that local anesthetics such as cocaine and tetracaine competitively
inhibited
the current induced by
m -chlorophenylbiguanide
in xenopus oocyte expressing
the cloned 5-ht, receptors (fan et al., 1994).
procaine inhibits the 5-ht current with a kd value
considerably
lower than those for na+ and nicotinic
acetylcholine
channels. kd values for the block of normal na+ channels, the veratridine- and batrachotoxinininduced opening of na+ channels were 90, 195 and
161 pm, respectively
(postma
and catterall,
1983;
barann et al., 1993) which are 50-l io-fold higher than
that on 5-ht current (1.7 pm). blockade of cation flux
through
nicotinic
receptor
may require even higher
concentrations
of procaine
(200 pm, forman
and
miller, 1989b). different k,, values also suggest that the
mechanisms
of procaine action on these channels are
different. barann et al. (1993) reported that procaine
inhibited
the r4c-guanidinium
influx induced
by the
activation
of 5-ht, receptors in neuroblastoma
cells
with a kd of 151 pm, which is 90 times higher than that
of the present study. the mechanism for the difference
in these kd values is not known. it is possible that the
5-ht, receptors in neuroblastoma
cells and rat nodose
neurons may have different pharmacological
properties.
the k,, value of procaine on 5-ht, receptors is very
likely below the effective procaine concentrations
for its
behavioural
effects and lower than tissue procaine levels
for infiltration
anesthesia and peripheral nerve block. in

procaine-induced
general anesthesia (garfield and
gugino, 1987) subcutaneous administration of 800 mg
of procaine was required (the clinical limit is 1000 mg).
in the panic attack following the injection of procaine
penicillin, the plasma procaine level was 3.6-l 1 pg/ml or
15-47 p m (greene et al,, 1974). the solutions used for
infiltration anesthesia and peripheral nerve block contain 0.25-2% (io.685 mm) of procaine (ritchie and
greene, 1991). therefore, in these situations, it is very
possible that the 5-ht, receptor function in the nervous
system is affected. since 5-ht, receptors may play a role
in some aspects of mood, psychiatric disorders and drug
abuse (costa11 et al., 1990; fozard, 1992; greenshaw,
1993), a change in 5-ht, receptor function may contribute to the mechanisms underlying the behaviouraf effects
of procaine. it is also interesting to note that activation
of peripheral 5-ht, receptors mediates pain sensation in
human (richardson et al., 1985). inhibition of 5-ht,
receptor function in peripheral sensory neurons may also
contribute to the procaine-induced
local anesthesia.
however, further evidence is required to support such a
conclusion.
