abstract: the eye is innervated by numerous serotonergic nerves and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5ht) is present in
the aqueous humor of animal and human eyes. in an effort to delineate the role of the serotonergic system in modulating
intraocular pressure (iop) within the anterior segment of the eye, extensive topical ocular dosing studies were conducted
with a variety of 5ht ligands and in various animal species. even though certain  xxxg1108xxx  agonists decreased iop in
rabbits, these compounds failed to affect iop in normotensive or ocular hypertensive monkey eyes. in contrast, while
5ht2 agonists induced significant iop reductions in normotensive rat eyes and in eyes of ocular hypertensive
cynomolgus monkeys, these agents were inactive in ocular normotensive cats and rabbits. additional studies indicated a
strong involvement of 5ht2a receptors in mediating iop-lowering in conscious ocular hypertensive cynomolgus
monkeys. as a result of further structure-activity investigations, al-34662, a selective 5ht2 agonist (relative to other
5ht receptor types and sub-types) with high affinity, potency and efficacy at 5ht2a, 5ht2b and 5ht2c receptors was
discovered that efficaciously lowered iop in the monkey model of ocular hypertension (33 ± 3 % reduction out to 6 hrs
post with  xxxd3426xxx  µg topical ocular dose). due to unavailability of monkey ocular cells, extensive in vitro studies were
conducted using relevant human ocular cells in order to correlate with and support the in vivo observations in the
monkeys. rt-pcr and in situ hybridization studies revealed the presence of mrnas for 5ht2a-c receptor subtypes in
human ocular tissues involved in iop modulation. the relative distribution and density of these mrnas were as follows:
ciliary body (cb) (5ht2a > 5ht2b > 5ht2c), ciliary epithelium (ce) (5ht2a > 5ht2b = 5ht2c) and trabecular meshwork
(tm) (5ht2a= 5ht2b >> 5ht2c). furthermore, quantitative autoradiography revealed a relatively high specific binding of
[3h]-5ht and [3h]- xxxd2419xxx  to 5ht2 receptors in human ce and longitudinal ciliary muscle (cm). second messenger
studies revealed the presence of phospholipase c-coupled 5ht2a receptors in h-cm and h-tm cells where they stimulated
phosphoinositide (pi) hydrolysis and mobilized intracellular ca2+ when challenged with a variety of 5ht2a-c receptor
agonists (e.g. alpha-methyl-5ht, (r)-doi, alpha-methyl-5ht, bw-723c86, mk-212, mcpp, cabergoline, al-34662). these
functional responses were blocked by selective 5ht2 receptor antagonists with the 5ht2a antagonist, m-100970,
exhibiting the highest potency. thus, functional 5ht2a receptors are present in human ocular cells involved in iop
reduction and this correlates with the ability of 5ht2a agonists to lower iop in cynomolgus monkeys, a surrogate for
human subjects.

introduction
primary open angle glaucoma (poag) is a collection of
optic neuropathies that is characterized by a loss of retinal
ganglion cells (rgcs), thinning of the optic nerve head due
to loss of rgc axons, and a consequential excavation
(“cupping”) of the optic nerve head disc. glaucoma afflicts >
70 million humans world-wide and is the second leading
cause of blindness in the world [1, 2]. while numerous risk
factors are associated with poag, such as race, increasing
age, family history and systemic hypertension, the major risk
factor is elevated intraocular pressure (iop) or ocular
hypertension [1, 2].
since the ocular field and the eye anatomy and functional
diversity of the many tissues within the eye may not be
familiar to many of the readers, a brief overview of this
aspect will be presented first. for simplicity, the eye can

essentially be divided into the anterior segment and the
posterior segment. the anterior chamber comprises the
cornea on the outer portion and the lens on the inner portion
separating the two chambers. while the anterior chamber
contains the aqueous humor (aqh), the posterior chamber is
bounded by the lens and the retina-choroid and contains the
vitreous humor (vh), a gelatinous substance. apart from the
cornea and nearby conjunctiva on the anterior surface, and
the optic nerve at the posterior part of the globe, the eye is
encased in a tough fibrous material, the sclera (figs. 1a,b).
the aqh, vh and the sclera help maintain the shape of the
globe and protect the delicate tissues inside including the
retina. the aqh is synthesized by the ciliary epithelium
(ce) within the ciliary bodies (cbs) located at the lateral
edges of the lens and fills the anterior chamber of the eye.
the aqh fluid flows out of the anterior chamber via the
trabecular meshwork (tm) and down the canal of schlemm
(fig. 1b) that then empties into the episcleral venous
circulation [3, 4]. another route for the aqh to exit the eye
is via the uveoscleral pathway crossing the fibers of the
ciliary muscle to the sclera [5] (fig. 1b). normally, the rates
of aqh production and elimination are fairly constant thus

maintaining a fairly constant pressure in the anterior
chamber, thereby nourishing the uveal tissues and
maintaining the shape of the globe. however, as the tm
and/or canal of schlemm begin to lose their porosity due to
accumulation of extracellular matrix (ecm) [6, 7] and the
aqh egress from the anterior chamber slows down, the iop
begins to rise. if this elevated iop is not lowered and
controlled by a pharmacological and/or surgical intervention,
the high pressure is transmitted to the back of the eye where
numerous pathological series of events ensue that eventually
lead to the death of rgcs. this causes thinning of the optic
nerve due to axonal dropout, excavation/ cupping of the
optic nerve head (onh) that over time cause loss of visual
acquity, leading eventually to blindness. even though
glaucoma is composed of several sub-classes of ocular/
retinal diseases, it is now well accepted that elevated iop is a
major risk factor associated with glaucoma [1, 2]. consequently glaucoma is currently treated by first reducing the
iop. treatments for oh over the years have included topical
ocular administration of beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g.
 xxxd3377xxx ; betaxolol), carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g.
 xxxd1931xxx ;  xxxd367xxx ) and alpha-2 adrenergic agonists
(e.g.  xxxd201xxx ; brimonidine) to reduce the production of
aqh, and fp-receptor-class prostaglandin agonists (e.g.
 xxxd2446xxx ;  xxxd3414xxx ) to promote and increase aqh

drainage [8-10]. due to a variety of deficiencies / sideeffects associated with the latter drugs (e.g. ocular
hyperemia; pulmonary insufficiency; duration of action;
increased orbital/iridial/ eye lash pigmentation), new therapeutic agents for treatment of oh/ poag are still being
sought. one recent line of investigation involving the serotonergic system appears to hold some promise with respect to
yielding a novel class of ocular hypotensive agents as will be
discussed below.
a rich serotonergic innervation of the eye has been
demonstrated [11-17], and 5ht has been found in both
chambers of the eye and within certain ocular tissues [1823]. using a variety of techniques, numerous types and
subtypes of serotonergic receptors and their mrnas have
also been identified and pharmacologically characterized in
ocular tissues and cells of different species. some of the
methods utilized included: rt-pcr and in situ hybridization
to localize 5ht receptor mrnas [24-28], receptor binding
to ocular tissue homogenates [29-31], autoradiography to
visualize binding sites for a variety of serotonergic radioligands [32], second messenger assays to define signal
transduction mechanism coupled to ocular 5ht receptors
[33-44], electrophysiological measurements to demonstrate
the coupling of certain 5ht receptors to channels [45-48],

fig. (1b). a cut-away diagram of the anterior chamber of the eye. the flow of the aqueous humor from the production site (ciliary process/
ciliary epithelium) through the anterior chamber and efflux via the trabecular meshwork to the schlemm’s canal (conventional outflow), or
via the ciliary muscle bundles and out through the sclera (uveoscleral outflow) is indicated by the dark black arrows.

radiolabeled transmitter release assays to define existence of
ocular pre-synaptic 5ht receptors [49, 50], tissue contraction [51] and other functional assays/ techniques to characterize ocular 5ht receptors [12, 52].
the physiological roles of endogenous 5ht in the eye
have been difficult to of delineate. however, there has been
some progress made with respect to defining its potential
involvement in modulating iop in animals and humans.
thus, early studies showed that inhibition of 5ht uptake
caused an elevation of iop following intravenous injection
of fluoxetine [53, 54]. however, topical ocular dosing of
rabbits with 5ht resulted in an elevation or decrease in iop
[55, 56]. since  xxxg1108xxx  agonists, for instance 8-hydroxydpat [57, 58] and flesinoxan [59], lowered iop in ocular
normotensive rabbits, some researchers concluded that the
reduction of cellular camp by  xxxg1108xxx  receptor activation
was necessary for causing ocular hypotension. this hypothesis was further supported by the detection of  xxxg1108xxx 
receptor binding sites in rabbit iris-ciliary body (icb) [31]
and functionally active  xxxg1108xxx  receptors in this tissue of
rabbit and humans [37, 38] and in bovine icb [51]. unfortunately, since  xxxg1108xxx  agonists failed to lower iop of ocular
normotensive or ocular hypertensive cynomolgus monkeys
[60], the prevalence of major species differences in the

response to serotonergic compounds in terms of influencing
ocular hypertension became evident.
other investigators noted that certain 5ht2 receptor
antagonists, including  xxxd2419xxx  [61-65], sarpogrelate [66]
and more recently with bvt-28949 and related compounds
[67, 68], lowered iop in ocular normotensive rabbits and
human subjects. once again, since these results could not be
reproduced in conscious cynomolgus monkey eyes made
ocular hypertensive by laser-ablation of their tm [32, 43,
60], species differences also prevailed for the iop lowering
effects of this class of serotonergic agents. furthermore, it
became clear that in fact it was the alpha-1-adrenergic
receptor antagonist activity associated with 5ht2 antagonists
(e.g.  xxxd2419xxx , m-100907, cinanserin, ritanserin) [69-73]
that accounted for the iop reduction observed with these
compounds. with this confusing background, we undertook
an extensive series of studies from which we made a novel
observation that 5ht2 ligands possessing agonist activity at
5ht2a (predominantly), 5ht2b and 5ht2c receptors consistently lowered iop in conscious ocular hypertensive nonhuman primates [32, 43, 44, 74-77]. parallel in vitro studies
helped provide correlative data for these observations.

porcine and human ocular tissues and cells [25-28].
however, a consistent observation pertained to the apparent
enrichment of 5ht2 family of receptor mrnas in ciliary
body (cb), ciliary epithelium (ce) and trabecular meshwork
(tm) (fig. 2; table 1; [26, 28]), tissues/ cells involved in
aqueous humor dynamics in the anterior segment of the eye.
even though 5ht2a receptor mrnas predominated and
were detected in tissue specimens from numerous eyes,
5ht2b and 5ht2c receptor mrnas were also found in these
tissues / cells (table 1; fig. 2). in addition, quantitative
autoradiographic techniques revealed a high density of 5ht2
receptors in human ciliary processes (cp), cb and ciliary
muscle (cm), in addition to other tissues [32] (fig. 3; table
2). 5ht2 agonists exhibiting high affinities for 5ht2a, 5ht2b

localization of ocular 5ht2 receptor
mrnas and proteins
the presence of serotonergic nerves in and around the
rabbit eye [13, 25] and the detection of free 5ht in the
aqueous humor of rats [23], rabbits [20] and humans [19, 20,
22] led to subsequent studies to determine the physiological
role of 5ht and its receptors in ocular functions.
rt-pcr and in situ hybridization revealed a broad
distribution of 5ht receptor subtype mrnas in rabbit,

5ht2 receptor agonists (e.g. 5ht, alpha-methyl 5ht, (r)-doi,
al-34662; mk-212, mcpp, bw723c86, cabergoline)
potently induced the generation of inositol phosphates via

and cm cells. these observations were expanded to include
use of human cloned 5ht2 receptor subtypes and gtp-gamma-s35
binding as another index of receptor activation (table 5).
using 5ht2-receptor-selective antagonists [69,70,79-84],
it was demonstrated that the pi turnover and [ca2+]i

potently blocked by m-100970 (5ht2a antagonist; ic50s = 12 nm), followed by rs-102221 and sb-242084 (5ht2c
antagonists; ic50s = 1-4 µm), and then by rs-127445 and
sdzser082 (5ht2b antagonists; ic50s > 1-10 µm) (fig. 8;
table 6; [32, 43, 44, 76]). the down-stream effects of 5ht2
receptor activation (e.g. by cabergoline) in human cm cells
involved the production and secretion of matrix metalloproteinases [76]. these proteolytic enzymes are known to be
involved in re-modeling of the extracellular space by diges-

ting the extracellular matrix and other debris to generate or
enlarge the uveoscleral pathway routes [85]. in addition,
such stimulatory activities of cabergoline accounted for the
increase of aqh aggress from the anterior chamber of the
isolated perfused pig eye (fig. 10; [76]) that in vivo would be
reflected as an overall decrease in iop [85]. another ioplowering mechanism by 5ht2 agonists may involve a
mechanical contraction/ relaxation of cm and/or tm tissues
[86] with perhaps an additional involvement of mmp release
during such tissue stretching or relaxing [87].

these collective data indicated that functionally active
5ht2 receptors are present in human ocular cells and that
their activation leads to second messenger generations that
then mediate the other down-stream biological effects of
5ht2 agonists culminating in an iop-lowering action [32,
43, 44, 60, 76, 78] (see below).

much confusion has prevailed in the literature concerning
the ocular hypotensive activity of a variety of serotonergic
agonists and antagonists due to the fact that different routes
of administration [53-66] and different species of animals
[53-66] were utilized (see introduction). in order to address
these issues, a systematic approach was undertaken to evaluate the numerous 5ht classes of compounds in a given
species using the same vehicle (phosphate buffered vehicle
(pbs) containing 0.5% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,
0.05% polysorbate 80, 0.01% edta, and 0.01% benzalkonium chloride, ph 7.5) and by the same topical ocular dosing
regimen and iop measurement procedures [60, 76]. briefly,
iop was measured using an alcon pneumatonometer after
light corneal anesthesia with 0.1% proparacaine. eyes were
rinsed with one or two drops of saline after each measurement. after a baseline iop measurement, test compounds
made in the vehicle was instilled in one or two 30 µl
aliquots to the ocular hypertensive (made by laser-induced
trabeculoplasty) eyes of trained conscious cynomolgus
monkeys. vehicle was instilled in the other (normotensive)
eyes. other species of animals utilized included ocular
normotensive dutch-belted ocular pigmented or new
zealand white albino rabbits, mixed gender cats, hartley
guinea pigs and brown norway ocular pigmented rats.

taken together, it was found that agents having agonist
or antagonist activity at  xxxg1108xxx ,  xxxg1110xxx , 5ht3 and 5ht4
receptors, and antagonists of 5ht2,  xxxg1112xxx  and 5ht7 receptors
lack iop-lowering activity, but that 5ht2 receptor agonists
exhibited efficacious iop reduction in the cynomolgus
monkey model of ocular hypertension and glaucoma (table
7). furthermore, using selective 5ht2 receptor agonists and
antagonists it became clear that activation of the 5ht2a
receptors, with perhaps some contribution(s) from 5ht2c and
5ht2b receptors, leads to the iop-lowering in the monkey
(tables 7 and 8) [32, 43, 44, 60, 74-76] and rat [76] but not
in rabbits and cats [76]. poor topical ocular bioavailability of
selective 5ht2 receptor antagonists prevented the delineation
of the relative contribution of the sub-types of the 5ht2
receptor to the ocular hypotension produced by 5ht2 agonists. in addition, the relative lack of binding and functional
selectivity of the test agonists utilized in our studies across
the human cloned 5ht2a, 5ht2b and 5ht2c receptor subtypes (tables 3-5), and their unknown relative corneal
permeability (and thus aqueous humor and anterior uveal
tissue concentrations achieved of test agents), the overall
conclusion is probably that all three 5ht2 receptors are
involved in whole or in part in the iop-lowering actions of
5ht2 agonists such as (r)-doi, alpha-methyl-5ht, cabergoline
and al-34662 (fig. 11; table 7-9) [32, 43, 44, 60, 74-76].
however, it was interesting to note that the pharmacological
data obtained using human cm and tm cells correlated well
with the ability of the 5ht2a agonists to lower monkey iop,
indicating perhaps that the ocular hypertensive monkey
model may be a useful surrogate for humans as far as the
ocular effects of 5ht2 agonists are concerned. however,
future studies with suitable serotonergic agents like al34662 [44, 75] in ocular hypertensive human subjects will
ultimately provide a confirmation of this hypothesis.

mechanisms of action of 5ht2 agonists in
ocular cells
the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms involved
in the ocular hypotensive activity of 5ht2 agonists is
unknown. some evidence has been gathered from use of
animal and human ocular cells/ tissues known to be
components of the system(s) that modulate aqh dynamics
in the anterior segment of the eye. some examples of the
information available to-date is presented below.
cabergoline is a compound that possesses multiple
pharmacological activities [76]. however, it activated 5ht2
receptors in human cm, tm cells and human cloned 5ht2

receptors to increase pi turnover and mobilization of [ca2+]i
[76], activities that were most potently blocked by the 5ht2a
antagonist, m-100907 [76]. furthermore, cabergoline lowered iop in conscious and ketamine-sedated ocular
hypertensive cynomolgus monkeys [76] and increased the
outflow of aqh in perfused porcine eyes [76]. likewise,
(r)-doi is a potent and selective 5ht2a agonist [32, 43, 69,
70, 83] that also activated the pi/ca2+ pathway in human cm
and tm cells, and that also lowered iop in ocular hypertensive monkey eyes [60, 78]. however, both cabergoline
(table 10; [76]) and (r)-doi [78] stimulated uveoscleral
outflow of aqueous humor in the monkey eyes to lower iop.

hours after the 2nd drop of cabergoline. times are ± half hour. statistical analyses: ‡comparing baseline day with treatment day using student's two-tailed, paired t-test. level of
significance (p) values were as shown above. topical ocular dose of cabergoline was 300 µg. data for cabergoline was dapted from ref. 76. # # for comparison, data for the aqueous
inflow inhibitor,  xxxd367xxx  (300 µg; n = 10-12 monkeys/ group), is shown in the last row as adapted from [94]. (fa is amount of aqh produced).

these compounds has not been fully delineated, cabergoline
increased human cm cell mmps-1-3 release (fig. 9; [76])
that probably was responsible for remodeling the cm and
the extracellular space to cause the iop reduction as has
been demonstrated for ocular hypotensive fp-class prostaglandins [85]. it was interesting to note that cabergoline also
stimulated aqueous humor outflow from the tm pathway in
perfused porcine eyes (fig. 10; [76]). however, in view of
the ability of 5ht2 agonists to contract ciliary muscle in
vitro [51] a mechanical effect being responsible for iop
lowering via the 5ht2 receptors cannot be ruled out [86].
regardless, even the cm contraction [51, 86] may ultimately
lead to involve mmp secretion since stretching of uveal
tissues causes release of mmps [6, 7, 86-90]. additional
effects of 5ht2 agonists to lower iop may involve the
recruitment of  xxxg1587xxx  to raise intra-cellular cgmp
[91] that could be instrumental in causing cm/tm relaxation
[86, 87] and also perhaps changing the tm cellular volume
[92, 93], all leading to outflow of aqh and thus reduction in
iop.

human cb and tm contained mrnas for 5ht2a-c receptors,
but that functionally active and pharmacologically responsive receptors expressed on human cm and tm cells were
essentially the 5ht2a sub-type. further studies using more
selective and topically ocular bio-available 5ht2 agonists
and antagonists, coupled with use of 5ht2a-c knock-out
mice, and use of short interfering rnas and /or use of 5ht2
receptor antibodies are necessary in order to delineate the
precise contributions of the different 5ht2 receptor sub-types
in the ocular hypotensive action of 5ht2 agonists in animals
and in human subjects. further progress in the understanding
of the pathophysiology of the anterior uveal tissues and cells
[3-5, 89] pertaining to the inflow and outflow pathways of
the eye, and the delineation of cellular/molecular mechanisms involved in aqh production and drainage is anxiously
anticipated and awaited.

concluding remarks
the non-human primate model of ocular hypertension
has proven to be a fairly good predictor of iop-lowering
efficacy in human subjects for a number of different classes
of ocular hypotensive agents such as carbonic anhydrase
inhibitors [94], beta-blockers [95, 96], dp-class and fp-class
prostaglandins [97-102]. despite the early confusion in the
literature amongst the serotonergic classes of compounds
exhibiting ocular hypotensive activity, it would appear that
5ht2 receptors are the principle targets that mediate the
ocular hypotension in the conscious ocular hypertensive
cynomolgus monkey [32, 43, 44, 60, 74-76]. recent studies
with selective 5ht2 receptor agonists and antagonists
appeared to suggest that 5ht2a receptors, with potentially
some contributions from 5ht2b and 5ht2c receptors, were
the key mediators of iop-lowering in the latter animal
model. this was borne out further by the observations that
