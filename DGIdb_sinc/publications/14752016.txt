life, and (d) well-established use as an early and quantitative marker of cns injury.  xxxg2007xxx  can also offer the
additional advantage of providing a quantitative indicator of the extent of brain lesions in various diseases
(10, 11, 13, 14 ), and several previous studies have demonstrated the prognostic value of serum  xxxg2007xxx  in predicting
neurologic prognosis in various conditions, including
head trauma, stroke, and cardiac arrest (9, 10, 18, 24 ).
in spite of the small size of our sample, our findings
provide preliminary evidence that increased  xxxg2007xxx  is
associated with eclampsia. further studies with larger
samples are required to determine whether these values
can be used to predict the development of eclampsia
before it leads to overt clinical manifestations. if this turns
out to be the case, the use of  xxxg2007xxx  measurements to
predict cns involvement in pregnancy-related hypertension might conceivably play a useful role in the clinical
management of this condition.

determination of  xxxg2319xxx  activity in isolated human erythrocytes does not reflect
putative in vivo enzyme inhibition by  xxxd3255xxx ,

determination of  xxxg2319xxx  ( xxxg2319xxx ;
 xxxg2319xxx ) activity is intended to screen patients before
therapy with  xxxd2573xxx  drugs (6- xxxd2573xxx , 6- xxxd3352xxx , and azathioprine) to rule out a deficiency in this
enzyme. the enzyme catalyzes the s-methylation of these
medicinal agents, a metabolic pathway that competes
with the formation of pharmacologically active 6- xxxd3352xxx  nucleotides (6-tgns), thereby modulating their therapeutic and toxic effects (1, 2 ). individuals with low
 xxxg2319xxx  activity are known to be at high risk for severe
 xxxd2573xxx -induced myelodepression. in addition to a
genetic polymorphism of  xxxg2319xxx  alleles, which is responsible for the wide interindividual differences in  xxxg2319xxx 
activity, cotherapy with various drugs, including aminosalicylates, has been shown to influence enzyme activity

clinical chemistry 50, no. 2, 2004

(1, 2 ). in vitro kinetic studies with recombinant human
 xxxg2319xxx  demonstrated that  xxxd3255xxx , 5-aminosalicylic
acid,  xxxd282xxx , and  xxxd2781xxx  (3–5 ) inhibit the enzyme
activity in a noncompetitive manner. therefore, simultaneous therapy with both thiopurines and aminosalicylates
was postulated to create a “phenocopy” of individuals
with a low  xxxg2319xxx  activity genotype (1 ). in line with this
hypothesis, lewis et al. (3 ) described a case of a patient
with crohn disease and  xxxg2319xxx  activity in the low normal
range who had severe bone marrow dysfunction while
receiving treatment with 6- xxxd2573xxx  and  xxxd2781xxx . the authors speculated that the  xxxg2319xxx  activity
determined ex vivo represented the patient’s baseline
 xxxg2319xxx  activity in vivo because the inhibitory effect of
 xxxd2781xxx  would be removed by dilution in the assay.
subsequently, several groups (6 – 8 ) investigated this
drug– drug interaction in clinical studies with more cases.
as indicators of an inhibitory effect, ex vivo determination of erythrocyte  xxxg2319xxx  activity and erythrocyte 6-tgns
were chosen. no changes in  xxxg2319xxx  activity, but significantly increased 6-tgn concentrations, were observed
under combined  xxxd2573xxx /aminosalicylate therapy
(6, 8 ). whereas lowry et al. (6 ) speculated that the
increase in 6-tgns probably resulted from  xxxg2319xxx  inhibition, the unchanged  xxxg2319xxx  activity was considered by
others as an indication that concomitant medication with
aminosalicylates does not influence  xxxg2319xxx  enzyme activity in vivo (7 ) and that the increase in 6-tgns is not
caused by  xxxg2319xxx  inhibition (8 ). however, it is not clear
whether the interpretations reported in these publications
(7, 8 ) are correct because the authors also used ex vivo
determination of  xxxg2319xxx  activity in isolated erythrocytes.
the isolation procedure includes multiple washing steps
with hanks solution, after which the isolated erythrocytes
are resuspended in four volumes of ice-cold distilled
water for analysis. a reversible inhibitor could be removed during this step. because to the best of our
knowledge there has been no systematic investigation on
whether the sample pretreatment procedure influences
the determination of the  xxxg2319xxx  activity in patients receiving aminosalicylate therapy, we performed in vitro experiments to clarify this uncertainty. such experiments are
important to answer the question of whether  xxxg2319xxx 
activity assays in erythrocytes can be used to investigate
and/or to predict the risk of  xxxd2573xxx -induced toxicity
potentially resulting from concomitant  xxxd2573xxx  and
aminosalicylate drug therapy.
both erythrocyte isolation and determination of  xxxg2319xxx 
activity were performed as described previously in detail
(9 ).  xxxd3255xxx ; s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx  ( xxxd1526xxx  salt); d,l-dithiothreitol; 4-aminoacetophenone; trichloroacetic acid;  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso); triethylamine; and hanks  xxxd2988xxx  (hbss) were
supplied by sigma. 6- xxxd2573xxx  was obtained from
fluka, and 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-mmp) was from
icn. acetonitrile (hplc grade), phosphoric acid, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, dipotassium hydrogen
phosphate, and sodium hydroxide were purchased from
merck.

 xxxg2319xxx  activity was measured in isolated erythrocytes
(see below), after lysis with four volumes of ice-cold
water, by an established hplc procedure (9 ) based on
the conversion of 6- xxxd2573xxx  (ph 7.5 and 37 °c) to
6-mmp with s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx  as the methyl donor.  xxxg2319xxx  activity is expressed as nmol of 6-mmp
formed per milliliter of packed erythrocytes per hour
[nmol 䡠 (ml ery)⫺1 䡠 h⫺1]. results were corrected for sample dilution, hematocrit, and incubation time. calibration
and quality-control materials were prepared by adding
a 6-mmp stock solution to the erythrocyte lysate, giving
enzyme activities between 4 and 40 nmol 䡠 (ml
ery)⫺1 䡠 h⫺1. in addition, two separate erythrocyte pools
obtained from individuals with either high [14.3
nmol 䡠 (ml ery)⫺1 䡠 h⫺1] or intermediate [6.5 nmol 䡠 (ml
ery)⫺1 䡠 h⫺1]  xxxg2319xxx  activities were included in every
incubation batch as precision controls. the assay was
linear up to 50 nmol 䡠 (ml ery)⫺1 䡠 h⫺1, and the detection
limit was 0.3 nmol 䡠 (ml ery)⫺1 䡠 h⫺1. the analytical recovery of 6-mmp ranged between 98.3% and 101.8%. the
within-day imprecision for pooled human erythrocytes
was ⬍5%, and the between-day imprecision was ⬍7.6%.
the respective cv for the control samples enriched with
6-mmp were ⬍2.4% for both within- and between-day
studies.
surplus edta-blood from routine laboratory analysis
was used to prepare four erythrocyte pools with which
the experiments were performed. the erythrocyte isolation procedure was performed as follows: after centrifugation at 800g for 10 min, plasma, leukocytes, and the
upper layer of the erythrocytes were removed. after the
pellet was washed three times with hbss (8 ml) and
centrifuged for 10 min at 800g, 2 ml of red blood cells was
resuspended in 2 ml of hbss, and the hematocrit was
determined with an automatic cell counting device (ac.t
5diff; beckman coulter).
for the experiments (fig. 1a), the erythrocyte pool was
divided into five 0.5-ml portions, four of which were
incubated for 24 h at 37 °c in the presence of 80, 160, 320,
or 640 ␮mol/l  xxxd3255xxx . for this purpose, four different  xxxd3255xxx  stock solutions were prepared in
dmso and added to the erythrocyte portions in 10-␮l
aliquots. the fifth portion of erythrocytes was used as a
control to which only 10 ␮l of dmso was added. the
 xxxd3255xxx  concentrations were chosen in accordance
with the known ic50 values for this inhibitor, reported
with recombinant human  xxxg2319xxx  [78 and 104 ␮mol/l
(4, 5 )]. plasma  xxxd3255xxx  concentrations after an oral
dose are somewhat below, but close to, the ic50 (2, 4, 5 ).
after 24 h, each incubated sample was divided into two
portions. the first one was processed directly for determination of  xxxg2319xxx  activity. the second one was again
washed three times with hbss (0.5 ml), resuspended in a
final volume of ⬃250 ␮l of hbss, and after determination
of the hematocrit, was processed for analysis of  xxxg2319xxx 
activity. all samples were run in duplicate, and the
experiment was repeated with another three erythrocyte
pools on 3 separate days (total n ⫽ 4).
to evaluate differences between groups, the mann–

whitney test and medcalc®, ver. 4.20 (mariakerke), were
performed. p values ⬍0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. normally distributed data are presented
as the mean (sd); nonnormally distributed data are presented as the median (range).
as shown in fig. 1b, the presence of increasing concentrations of  xxxd3255xxx  in the reaction mixture containing
the lysed erythrocytes preparations a (fig. 1a) produced
a significant, concentration-dependent inhibition of the
enzyme activity. in the absence of the inhibitor, mean
 xxxg2319xxx  (control samples) activity was 10.3 (2.31)
nmol 䡠 (ml ery)⫺1 䡠 h⫺1 in the four separate pools. incubation with 80, 160, 320, and 640 ␮mol/l  xxxd3255xxx 
gave  xxxg2319xxx  activities of 9.15 (0.66), 7.70 (1.85), 7.05 (0.87),
and 5.73 (0.85) nmol 䡠 (ml ery)⫺1 䡠 h⫺1, respectively. an-

alytical as well as interindividual variability may be
responsible for the up to threefold differences in the
degree of inhibition found in multiple experiments using
the four different erythrocyte pools.
in the case of the additionally washed erythrocyte
samples (preparations b; fig. 1a), a slight but not significant decrease in the median  xxxg2319xxx  activity (ⱕ10% of
control) was observed at  xxxd3255xxx  concentrations up
to 320 ␮mol/l (fig. 1b). although an additional decrease
(⬃35%) in the median  xxxg2319xxx  activity was found at a
 xxxd3255xxx  concentration of 640 ␮mol/l, this did not
reach statistical significance because of the wide variation
in the individual results. these findings suggest that
during the erythrocyte isolation procedure, the inhibitor
is at least partly removed during the wash step. this
assumption, which is compatible with the relatively poor
solubility of  xxxd3255xxx  in water, was further supported
by the fact that the  xxxd3255xxx  concentration after the
wash step (preparation b) was 15–35% lower than in
preparation a over the entire  xxxd3255xxx  concentration
range tested. these data are based on the differences in
the areas of the  xxxd3255xxx  peaks between preparations
a and b, as codetected in our hplc procedure (retention
time of  xxxd3255xxx , 11.7 min) in relation to the internal
standard. the incomplete and variable removal of the
inhibitor during the washing step of the routinely applied
 xxxg2319xxx  activity assay precludes both reliable detection of a
putative in vivo inhibition of  xxxg2319xxx  by  xxxd3255xxx  as
well as correct determination of the basic individual
 xxxg2319xxx  phenotype. in a similar experiment with  xxxd2579xxx  (5- xxxd153xxx ) instead of  xxxd3255xxx 
(data not shown), we found that this is also true for this
aminosalicylic drug.
it can be concluded that the determination of  xxxg2319xxx 
phenotype in isolated human erythrocytes does not reflect
putative in vivo enzyme inhibition by aminosalicylates
and cannot be used to investigate and/or predict the risk
of  xxxd2573xxx -induced toxicity potentially resulting from
concomitant therapy with  xxxd2573xxx  and aminosalicylate
drugs. assessment of 6-tgn concentrations would thus
be a better indicator of in vivo drug– drug interaction
between these medications. furthermore, this could be
also expected for any potential reversible inhibitor of
 xxxg2319xxx  in the sample; thus, probably only the effects of
modulators that influence the synthesis/degradation of
the enzyme protein can be detected by the assay system.

creatine in the human body is derived from two sources:
the diet and endogenous synthesis. biosynthesis involves
two enzymes:  xxxg868xxx  (ec
2.1.4.1) and  xxxg858xxx  ( xxxg858xxx ;
 xxxg858xxx ). defects in both of these enzymes lead to
inborn errors of metabolism (1, 2 ). deficiency of  xxxg868xxx  has been reported very
recently in two patients by item et al. (3 ) and bianchi et al.
(4 ).
 xxxg858xxx  deficiency was first described in 1994 (1, 5 ). the
clinical presentation of the disease varies widely (2, 6 ).
some patients present with intractable epilepsy, extrapyramidal movement disorder, and severe retardation,
whereas other patients have much milder symptoms and
show only mild retardation and autistic behavior.
the aspecific clinical picture of  xxxg858xxx  deficiency and
the relatively good treatment options makes a good
diagnostic strategy important. magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the brains of affected patients shows absence
of the creatine/creatine phosphate peak. however, magnetic resonance spectroscopy may not be performed on all
patients with mild symptoms. screening for metabolic
disorders may also aid in the diagnosis because generalized increases in amino acids, organic acids, and other
metabolites can be found when their concentrations are
calculated relative to the creatinine concentration (2 ). the
relatively low creatinine excretion in  xxxg858xxx  patients,
which is attributable to the creatine deficiency, gives
falsely increased values for a range of metabolites when

441

they are calculated relative to creatinine. when  xxxg858xxx 
deficiency is suspected, analysis of  xxxd2244xxx  in
plasma should be performed (7, 8 ). confirmation of the
defect can be obtained by enzymatic and dna analysis
(9, 10 ).
ilas et al. (11 ) described an assay for the determination
of  xxxg858xxx  in fibroblasts and lymphoblasts. this method
uses 14c-labeled  xxxd2244xxx  as substrate. product
formation ([14c]creatine) is determined by hplc with
detection of the radioisotope. because in healthy individuals  xxxg858xxx  activity is low in lymphoblasts and even
lower in fibroblasts, large numbers of cells are needed for
the analysis.
we describe a new approach for the enzymatic diagnosis of  xxxg858xxx  deficiency. the method obviates the need for
radioactive compounds because it uses stable-isotopelabeled substrates. analysis of product formation is performed by stable-isotope-dilution gas chromatography–
mass spectrometry (gc-ms). the high sensitivity of the
assay enables reliable diagnosis of  xxxg858xxx  deficiency from
a smaller number of cells.
 xxxg858xxx -deficient cultivated epstein-barr-virus-transformed lymphoblasts and skin fibroblasts were available
from two and five patients with  xxxg858xxx  deficiency, respectively, as confirmed by increased concentrations of  xxxd2244xxx  in body fluids and by mutation studies.
lymphoblast cell lines were also obtained from two
carriers of  xxxg858xxx  deficiency.
control lymphoblasts and fibroblasts were available
from pediatric patients without a diagnosis of inborn
error of metabolism and from controls, and had originally
been obtained for carrier screening. no defects were
found, and the samples were anonymized.
lymphoblasts and fibroblasts were harvested from
culture flasks and washed twice with hanks balanced salt
solution (gibcobrl). pellets were resuspended in 200
mmol/l tris-hcl (ph 8.5) and kept on ice. the cells were
sonicated (3 times; 10 s each time at standard capacity) on
ice with a soniprep 150 ultrasonic desintegrator (mse).
lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °c and 8800g
(hettich centrifuge micro22r). after the protein concentrations were measured (bicinchoninic acid protein assay;
sigma), the supernatants were used for the enzyme assay.
tris-hcl and dithiothreitol were purchased from
merck. [ xxxd2360xxx ]- xxxd3156xxx  (sam-d3; ⬎99 atom-% d) and [ xxxd2360xxx ]creatine (⬎99 atom-% d) were purchased from c/d/n isotopes. [13c2] xxxd2244xxx 
was synthesized as described previously (8 ).
the reaction mixture contained 100 mmol/l tris-hcl
(ph 8.5), 2 mmol/l dithiothreitol, 1.5 mmol/l sam-d3, 1
mmol/l [13c2] xxxd2244xxx , and cell homogenates
containing 0.5–1 mg of protein for lymphoblasts and
0.1– 0.4 mg (corresponding to less than one-half of a
75-cm2 culture flask) for fibroblasts in a final volume of 0.2
ml. assay blanks were incubated with distilled water
instead of [13c2] xxxd2244xxx .
the reaction mixture was incubated for 2 h at 37 °c.
one 85-␮l sample was taken at the start and one sample
