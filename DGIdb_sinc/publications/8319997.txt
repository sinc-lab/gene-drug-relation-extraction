comparative effects of three different potent
renin inhibitors in primates
jean-paul clozel, walter fischli
the goal of the present study was to compare the effects of three potent reference renin inhibitors
( xxxd3095xxx , cgp 38560a, and  xxxd1990xxx ) in sodium-depleted normotensive squirrel monkeys. in these
monkeys, arterial pressure was measured in the conscious state with a telemetry system. oral and
intravenous maximal effective doses of the three renin inhibitors were compared in parallel groups of
monkeys. in additional experiments,  xxxd3095xxx  was given on top of either cgp 38560a or  xxxd1990xxx  in the
same animals. finally, the three drugs were compared with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor
 xxxd1694xxx . the effects of the three drugs on the plasma components of the renin-angiotensin system
(plasma renin activity, immunoreactive renin, and immunoreactive  xxxg99xxx  concentrations) were
also measured. our results show that  xxxd3095xxx  was as effective as  xxxd1694xxx  and markedly more effective
than cgp 38560a or  xxxd1990xxx  in reducing arterial pressure in our monkey model. interestingly, these
differences in arterial pressure could not be explained by differences of in vitro potency or different
biochemical changes of the plasma components of the renin-angiotensin system, because the inhibitors all
reduced immunoreactive  xxxg99xxx  to similarly low levels. one possible explanation is that, in our
model,  xxxd3095xxx  in contrast to cgp 38560a and  xxxd1990xxx  is able to inhibit renin in a functionally
important extraplasmatic compartment. (hypertension 1993;22:9-17)

enin inhibitors (for review, see references 1
through 5) are presently proposed as new
antihypertensive drugs. like angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors, they can reduce arterial pressure by blocking the renin-angiotensin system.
however, these drugs should theoretically be devoid of
the side effects of ace inhibitors such as cough or
angioneurotic edema. these side effects have been
attributed to the potentiation of bradykinin effects6'7
secondary to the inhibition of ace, which cleaves not
only  xxxg99xxx  (ang i) but also bradykinin.8
cgp 38560a,9  xxxd1990xxx , 1013 and remikiren14 have
been described as potent renin inhibitors in primates.
however, clinical results in hypertensive patients are
controversial. only  xxxd3095xxx  has been shown to lower
arterial pressure in hypertensive patients under a normal-sodium diet after oral application.15 in hypertensive
patients, cgp 38560a had a limited antihypertensive
effect compared with captopril when given intravenously.16  xxxd1990xxx  was shown to have an antihypertensive
effect after high intravenous doses17-18 or after longterm intravenous infusion.19 no oral testing was
performed.
the goal of the present study was to perform a
comparison of these three drugs in primates. for this
purpose, the effects of the three drugs on arterial
pressure and on the different plasma components of the

1993.

methods

in vitro experiments
the in vitro potency of the compounds was evaluated
in edta plasma of humans and squirrel monkeys
under the same conditions as the plasma renin activity
(pra) was measured (trapping assay, see below) and
against purified human renal renin. for the plasma
assay, the inhibitors were made up as a solution of 85
/um in  xxxd1896xxx  and diluted further by the
antibody solution 10- to 100 000-fold (see below).
the plasma assay for measuring the in vitro potencies
of the renin inhibitors was performed at ph 7.4 and was
similar to the trapping assay used for the estimation of
pra developed by nussberger et al.20 the assay consisted of (1) 75 /ml human or squirrel monkey edtaplasma; (2) 75 ,u,l trapping buffer (0.2 m tris-hcl, ph
7.5, including 0.3% human  xxxg124xxx ) with or
without ang i standards; (3) 7 fih of 3 m tris-hcl, ph
7.2, including 200 mm edta; and (4) 3 fil antiserum
(as mauroy, 1:500) in trapping buffer. to save
pipetting, we premixed solutions 3 and 4 to give the
antibody solution, which was also used for the dilution
of the 85-/xm inhibitor stock solution.
the antibody used was a fast-binding polyclonal ang
i antibody raised at roche (ang i as mauroy) with
an ic50 of 60 pg per assay tube or 290 pm, which is
capable of trapping and protecting the formed ang i in
the absence of potentially disturbing angiotensinase
inhibitors.

the enzyme assay was started by incubation of mixtures (1), (2), and (4) for pra samples and (2), (3), and
(4) for the ang i standard curve at 37°c. it was stopped
2 hours later by addition of the remaining solution (1) or
(2) and 1 ml ice-cold  xxxd285xxx  acetate (0.06 m, ph
8.6), including 0.3% human  xxxg124xxx  containing
5000 cpm i25i-ang i, a solution that diluted the ang i
antibody to the correct radioimmunoassay working concentration. after an incubation of 24 hours at 4°c, the
radioimmunoassay was terminated by addition of 300
fil water containing 2.5% charcoal and 0.25% dextran
t70 and spinning at 3000g for 20 minutes. the supernatant was counted in a gamma counter. maximum
enzymatic ang i production (which is identical to
regular pra) was measured in the absence of inhibitors
and minimum ang i production (maximal inhibition) in
the presence of 10 /xm  xxxd3095xxx . pra for both human
and squirrel monkey plasma was approximately 2 ng
ang i/ml per hour. the percentage of inhibition was
calculated at each concentration point, and the concentration of renin inhibitor that inhibited enzymatic activity by 50% (ic50) was determined.
for use in the in vitro assay system, renin was purified
in one step from infarcted human kidneys by immunoaffinity chromatography as described.21 the material so
prepared was used directly for in vitro assays and had a
specific activity of 200 goldblatt units (gu) per milligram of protein.
the buffer used for the in vitro assay was 0.1 m
sodium phosphate, ph 7.4, containing 0.1% bovine
 xxxg124xxx  and 1 mm disodium-edta. the incubation mixture consisted of (1) 100 fil renin in assay
buffer (0.5 mgu/ml), (2) 30 /xl human tetradecapeptide renin substrate in 10 mm hc1 (10 /xm), (3) 10 fil
hydroxyquinoline sulfate in water (30 mm), (4) 145 fil
assay buffer, and (5) 15 /al renin inhibitor in dimethyl
sulfoxide at various concentrations. the samples were
incubated at 37°c for 3 hours. the generated ang i was
estimated by a commercially available radioimmunoassay kit (baxter healthcare corp, cambridge, mass).
hemodynamic experiments
the effect of  xxxd3095xxx  on arterial pressure and heart
rate was measured in squirrel monkeys of either sex
weighing 400 to 700 g. arterial pressure was monitored
in the conscious state in unrestrained, chronically instrumented monkeys with a telemetry system developed
in our laboratory.22 at least 1 week before the experiment, the monkeys were anesthetized, and a 3f highfidelity pressure tip transducer (millar instruments inc,
houston, tex) was inserted into the abdominal aorta
through the right femoral artery. then the catheter was
tunneled subcutaneously to the back of the monkey in
the interscapular region. the proximal part of the
catheter was connected to a transmitter located in a
jacket worn by the monkey. the blood pressure signal
was transmitted continuously to a receiver, which transformed the signal to an analogue value of blood pressure. both phasic and mean arterial pressures were
recorded. heart rate was derived from the phasic blood
pressure tracing. with this system, it was possible to
record arterial pressure for up to 24 months in the same
monkey. during the recording period, the monkeys
were kept in a separate room without human presence
to avoid pressure changes secondary to stress.

experiments were performed in normotensive monkeys that were sodium depleted by injecting 5 mg/kg of
furosemide subcutaneously 66, 43, and 18 hours before
the experiments.
ex vivo measurements
blood sampling. in separate groups of furosemidetreated, conscious squirrel monkeys (without telemetry
systems), measurement of plasma parameters was performed after a single oral administration of the renin
inhibitors (10 mg/kg) or placebo. for measurement of
pra and immunoreactive active renin (ir-ar), blood
samples (1 ml per time point) were obtained by direct
puncture from the femoral vein and collected in edta
(10 mm final concentration). for estimation of immunoreactive  xxxg99xxx  (ir-ang ii), blood samples
were taken at 30 minutes, the time of the maximal
inhibition of pra, and were added to prechilled tubes
containing edta as above but including the ace
inhibitor  xxxd1694xxx  and renin inhibitor  xxxd3095xxx  to a
final plasma concentration of 10~6 m. the blood samples were centrifuged at 3000g at 4°c for 10 minutes to
separate the plasma and were immediately frozen and
stored at -20°c until use.
measurement of plasma renin activity. for the determination of pra, the trapping methodology of poulsen
and jorgensen23 was used. the method measures renin
activity by a radioimmunological microassay based on
ang i trapping by antibodies. the adapted method is
described in detail by nussberger et al20 and also was
used for the estimation of in vitro potency of the renin
inhibitors (see in vitro experiments). the polyclonal
antibodies used (ang i as mauroy) were raised at
roche and showed essentially no cross-reactivity
against ang ii and angiotensin iii.
measurement of immunoreactive  xxxg99xxx . plasma
ir-ang ii was quantified after extraction of plasma on
sep-pak c18 cartridges as described.14 the polyclonal
antibody used for the measurement of ir-ang ii (ang ii
as no. 923) was raised at f. hoffmann-la roche ltd,
basel, switzerland. the ic50 value was 5.5±0.31 fmol
per assay tube (n=8), and the cross-reactivities against
other angiotensin peptides were ang ii, 100 %; ang i,
0.37+0.10%; ang i-(2-10), <0.02%; angiotensin hi,
<0.02%; ang ii-(3-8), 0.02%; ang ii-(4-8), <0.02%;
and ang ii-(5-8), <0.02%.  xxxd3095xxx  did not crossreact with either antiserum up to 10 /xm. thus, these
ang ii antibodies are not only highly sensitive but also
specific in an unprecedented manner.
measurement of immunoreactive active renin. ir-ar
was measured in separate groups of animals, according
to the method of menard et al,24 with an immunoradiometric assay commercially available at diagnostics
pasteur, marnes-la-coquette, france. the monoclonal
antibody used to detect active renin specifically recognizes an epitope of mature renin and does not crossreact with inactive prorenin but does cross-react fully
with active renin even when inhibited.

maximal effective doses as shown by the absence of
additional effects when higher doses were given.
because the experiments in parallel groups showed
clear differences among the three renin inhibitors on
arterial pressure, we performed additional experiments.
first, either cgp 38560a or  xxxd1990xxx  (10 mg/kg po or
1 mg/kg iv) was administered. two hours later, when
the plateau effect of these drugs on arterial pressure was
reached, a second dose of either the same compound or
of  xxxd3095xxx  was given, and arterial pressure was monitored for 2 more hours. finally, because the three drugs
had a different in vitro potency to inhibit renin, we
compared the effects of the three drugs given intravenously at doses inversely proportional to their in vitro
potency: 0.1, 0.25, and 1 mg/kg for  xxxd3095xxx , cgp
38560a, and  xxxd1990xxx , respectively.
combination with  xxxd1694xxx . to compare the effects of
the three renin inhibitors with those of  xxxd1694xxx , we
gave 10 mg/kg po of the three renin inhibitors, and after
2 hours, we added 10 mg/kg po of  xxxd1694xxx , a longacting ace inhibitor.25 thereafter, arterial pressure
was recorded for 2 more hours.
ex vivo measurements
pra and ir-ar were measured in separate groups of
sodium-depleted squirrel monkeys at baseline (before
drug administration) and 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes
after oral administration of placebo or 10 mg/kg  xxxd3095xxx , cgp 38560a, or  xxxd1990xxx . in addition, in other
groups of sodium-depleted monkeys, plasma ir-ang ii
was measured 30 minutes after administration of placebo
or of the three renin inhibitors (10 mg/kg po).
statistical analysis
all data are given as mean±sem. effects of the
drugs were compared using a newman-keuls test. to
avoid bias due to multiple comparisons, we performed
an analysis only at the time of peak effect (60 minutes).

because the peak effect for biochemical changes occurs
between 30 and 60 minutes, we performed a statistical
analysis at these two time points. an analysis was also
performed at 240 minutes but should only be considered
as descriptive. a value of p<.05 was considered
significant.
results
in vitro potency
in vitro, the three renin inhibitors were all potent
inhibitors of purified human renin, but cgp 38560a
and  xxxd3095xxx  were clearly superior in this system
compared with  xxxd1990xxx  (table). however, when the
potency was measured in human plasma under close to
physiological conditions,  xxxd3095xxx ,  xxxd1990xxx , and cgp
38560a were 7-, 20-, and 35-fold less potent, respectively. in squirrel monkey plasma, all the compounds
were 5- to 10-fold less potent than in human plasma.
in vivo effects on arterial pressure
there were marked differences of efficacy among the
three renin inhibitors after oral (fig 1) and intravenous

the better efficacy of  xxxd3095xxx  was confirmed by oral
(fig 3) and intravenous (fig 4) experiments, during
which  xxxd3095xxx  was given on top of cgp 38560a or
 xxxd1990xxx  in the same animals.  xxxd3095xxx  reduced
significantly arterial pressure further than a second dose
of the other two inhibitors.
when equipotent doses (calculated from in vitro
experiments) of 1, 0.25, and 0.1 mg/kg were administered intravenously, similar differences were seen as
described above (fig 5).
the arterial pressure after  xxxd3095xxx  was not further
decreased by the addition of  xxxd1694xxx  (fig 6). in
contrast, there was additional lowering of blood pressure when  xxxd1694xxx  was added to cgp 38560a and
 xxxd1990xxx .
ex vivo measurements
despite different in vitro potencies, the three renin
inhibitors decreased pra to a similar extent after a
dose of 10 mg/kg po (fig 7). this decrease, maximal at
30 minutes, was associated with a reactive rise of ir-ar,
which was similar with  xxxd3095xxx  and cgp 38560a and
smaller with  xxxd1990xxx . pra returned progressively to
baseline within 2 hours, with  xxxd1990xxx  overshooting at
240 minutes. in contrast, ir-ar was still increased at 240
minutes with the three renin inhibitors. in addition, the
three renin inhibitors decreased plasma ir-ang ii sig-

very surprising, because one could have expected similar efficacy with drugs having a common mechanism of
action, eg, renin inhibition. in addition, the three drugs
previously have been shown to be potent renin inhibitors and to lower arterial blood pressure in sodiumdepleted primates. 914 however, the in vitro potency of
these compounds is very much influenced by the methodology used. this is not completely unexpected, because the measured potency is an apparent affinity
influenced greatly by the protein binding, which reduces
the concentration of the available free drug. it is worth
noticing that addition of nonphysiological organic compounds, such as the angiotensinase inhibitors hydroxyquinoline sulfate or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,
which are frequently added to plasma assays, is able to
reverse the protein binding of the renin inhibitors. this
results in an increase of the apparent affinity, which no
longer reflects the physiological potency.26 the same
argument holds true for measuring ex vivo pra after
treatment with a renin inhibitor, which may result in

similar artifacts of the measured renin inhibition (see
references 26 and 27). hence, for the correlation of in
vitro potency with in vivo (blood pressure) and ex vivo
(pra) effects, it is important (1) to estimate the
apparent potency of the renin inhibitors in vitro in
plasma and ex vivo on pra using the same methodology and (2) to choose a methodology that is as close as
possible to physiological conditions. our methodologies
are compatible and physiological because we omitted
angiotensinase inhibitors but protected the formed ang
i by trapping it with ang i antibodies. this so-called
trapping methodology is described as being devoid of
major artifacts (see also, references 26 and 27), therefore measuring the apparent potency of the compounds
in vitro and ex vivo (pra) under conditions that should
allow an extrapolation to in vivo activity. under these
conditions, the observed potency in human plasma is
3.5-fold and 14-fold less than that described originally
for  xxxd1990xxx  (ic5o, 14 nm)28 and cgp 38560a (ic50,
0.7 nm),29 respectively.

it is interesting to note that, with the use of our
plasma methodology, the in vitro potencies are 7-, 20-,
and 35-fold less for  xxxd3095xxx ,  xxxd1990xxx , and cgp
38560a when compared with an in vitro assay using
purified renin (table). this would indicate that cgp
38560a displays the strongest plasma protein binding of
the three inhibitors and  xxxd3095xxx  the least, which
results in a change of the potency rank order and
suggests that  xxxd3095xxx  should be the most potent of the
three inhibitors in human trials. the same potency rank
order is found in squirrel monkey plasma but with 5- to

10-fold lower potencies of the three renin inhibitors
(table).
in sodium-depleted squirrel monkeys, after oral administration of the three inhibitors using the same high
dose of 10 mg/kg,  xxxd3095xxx  clearly reduced arterial
blood pressure more than  xxxd1990xxx  and cgp 38560a
(fig 1). it is worth mentioning that the oral dose used
represents the maximum effective oral dose of  xxxd3095xxx  in this model, as shown before.14 this is also
true for  xxxd1990xxx  and cgp 38560a, because a second

reduce arterial pressure further. to eliminate the possibility that the observed differences were due to interindividual differences, we performed experiments during which  xxxd3095xxx  was given on top of a treatment
with either  xxxd1990xxx  or cgp 38560a (figs 3 and 4).
these experiments confirmed that, in the same animals,
 xxxd1990xxx  and cgp 38560a were not able to reduce
arterial pressure to the same extent as  xxxd3095xxx .
however, all three compounds were able to affect the
different plasmatic components of the renin-angiotensin
system after the same oral dose. the effects on pra
were similar with  xxxd3095xxx  and cgp 38560a and less
with  xxxd1990xxx  (fig 7). similarly, the increase of ir-ar
was more marked with the former compounds and less

with the latter (fig 7). this increase of ir-ar is thought
to be due to the interruption of the negative feedback
loop by reduction of ang ii.30 indeed, plasma ir-ang ii
was found to be reduced at the time of the biggest pra
decrease compared with the control levels (fig 8). thus,
there seems to be a logical sequence of events, such as
pra inhibition resulting in reduction of ang ii leading
to an increased release of renin. similar biochemical
effects have been described previously in experimental
models 914 and in humans.1516-3133 but interestingly,
these changes in plasma biochemical variables, especially ir-ang ii, do not reflect the observed blood
pressure changes in our model.
nonparallelisms between biochemical changes of the
renin-angiotensin system and changes of blood pressure
by ace and renin inhibitors have been observed before
(for review, see reference 4). one of the most prominent cases was described after long-term treatment of
spontaneously hypertensive rats with enalapril, which
led to chronically lowered blood pressure but even
overshooting plasmatic ang ii levels.34 indeed, after
short-term treatment with  xxxd3095xxx , we also observe
long and profound blood pressure decreases but only
transient changes in biochemical variables as described
before.14 similar results were obtained in hypertensive
patients.15-26
to eliminate the differences in oral absorption, the
three renin inhibitors were also tested after intravenous
administration. after the same high dose of 1 mg/kg, a
distinct difference was still observed among the inhibitors in their ability to reduce arterial blood pressure
(fig 2). again, when tested subsequently in the same
animals,  xxxd3095xxx  reduced blood pressure significantly
more than the other two inhibitors (fig 4). moreover,
when the three inhibitors were given with doses that
should result in similar effects according to the in vitro
potencies, blood pressure responses were very different
(fig 5). whereas  xxxd3095xxx  reduced arterial pressure by
20 mm hg at this dose, the efficiency of the other two
inhibitors was much less.
the differences of blood pressure-lowering effects
are unlikely to be due to technical problems. we have

used conscious animals to avoid effects of anesthesia.35
moreover, we used a telemetry system to avoid effects
of stress. arterial pressure could be measured without
any human presence close to the monkeys. this is the
reason why it is difficult to compare the absolute
changes of arterial pressure obtained in our study to
those obtained in studies in which the drugs were tested
during anesthesia 1012 or with animals restrained.9 in
these conditions, both cgp 38560a9 and enalkiren10-12
were more effective than in our study.
 xxxd3095xxx  decreased arterial pressure to the same
level as  xxxd1694xxx , a new long-acting ace inhibitor.25
these results have been previously described.14 in contrast, both cgp 38560a and  xxxd1990xxx  were less effective than  xxxd1694xxx  in our model. a similar observation
has been made for cgp 38560a.36 however, in other
studies, both cgp 38560a9 or other renin inhibitors 3739
were shown to be as effective as ace inhibitors. interestingly, in hypertensive patients, cgp 38560a was less
effective than captopril.16 results in patients with
 xxxd1990xxx  are controversial.1839 the reason for these
discrepant findings is unclear but could be related to
differences in species, methodology, or both.
differences of efficacy have not been reported for
ace inhibitors. however, ace is an endothelial enzyme that is perhaps easier to reach than tissular renin
(because to inhibit renin in plasma is not sufficient to
reduce arterial pressure). in monkeys,  xxxd3095xxx  has a
distribution volume approximately 10 times the blood
volume (unpublished observation), which is larger than
the distribution volume of cgp 38560a40 or  xxxd1990xxx ,11
pointing to an extensive tissular distribution of  xxxd3095xxx  compared with both of the other renin inhibitors. these differences of tissular distribution could
explain the different antihypertensive efficacy of the
three drugs despite similar plasmatic biochemical
changes. this would assume that renin inhibition needs
to occur at the tissular level for arterial pressure to
decrease, at least in our model.
in humans, a major part of ang i production has been
shown to be tissular.41-42 in addition, it is possible to
measure ang i formation in vitro on isolated organs 4345
and in tissue culture.46 interestingly, in vitro ang i
formation by arterial vessels can be blocked by renin
inhibitors, which also shows that renin is the main
enzyme responsible for the ang i production.47 we
could show that  xxxd3095xxx  is present in various tissues,
including the vessel wall, where it has a very long
half-life (unpublished data). therefore, it is tempting to
believe that  xxxd3095xxx  is acting by inhibiting renin
present in an extraplasmatic compartment.
the fact that renin inhibitors could have different
antihypertensive efficacy underlines the necessity to
interpret with caution future results obtained in hypertensive patients treated with renin inhibitors, because it
may not be possible to extrapolate from one renin
inhibitor to another. moreover, clinical trials including
ace and renin inhibitors need to be performed to
compare the therapeutic benefit of both approaches.
