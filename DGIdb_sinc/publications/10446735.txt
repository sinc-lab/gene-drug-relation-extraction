mirtazapine: clinical overview.  there is currently available evidence that suggests that drugs combining 2 synergistic mechanisms of action (e.g., enhancement of both noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission) may yield superior therapeutic efficacy compared with a single therapeutic mechanism of highly selective agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris). the differences in antidepressant efficacy favoring dual-acting drugs may exist in particular for 3 difficult-to-treat groups of patients: those with endogenous depression, those with severe depression, or hospitalized depressed patients. mirtazapine differs from other new dual-acting antidepressants by not being a reuptake inhibitor. its antidepressant activity may be related to a direct enhancement of noradrenergic neurotransmission by blockade of  xxxg831xxx -autoreceptors. the rapid increase in serotonin (5-ht) synaptic levels by blockade of  xxxg831xxx -heteroreceptors indirectly enhances 5-ht1a-mediated neurotransmission since 5-ht2 and 5-ht3 are blocked by mirtazapine. the antidepressant efficacy of mirtazapine was established in several placebo-controlled trials. currently available evidence suggests that mirtazapine is effective in all levels of severity of depressive illness, as well as is in a broad range of symptoms associated with depression.
