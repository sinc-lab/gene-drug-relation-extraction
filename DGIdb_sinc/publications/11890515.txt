we investigated the potency and the selectivity profile of  xxxd3492xxx  on phosphodiesterase (pdes)
enzymes, its ability to modify cgmp metabolism and cause relaxation of penile smooth muscle and
its effect on erections in vivo under conditions of exogenous  xxxd2738xxx  (no) stimulation. pde
isozymes were extracted and purified from human platelets (pde5) or bovine sources (pdes 1, 2, 3,
4 and 6). the inhibition of these pdes and of human recombinant pdes by  xxxd3492xxx  was
determined. the ability to potentiate no-mediated relaxation and influence cgmp levels in human
corpus cavernosum strips was measured in vitro, and erection-inducing activity was demonstrated in conscious rabbits after oral administration together with intravenous doses of sodium
nitroprusside (snp). the effects of  xxxd3492xxx  were compared with those of the well-recognized
pde5 inhibitor, sildenafil (values for sildenafil in brackets).  xxxd3492xxx  specifically inhibited the
hydrolysis of cgmp by pde5 with an ic50 of 0.7 nm (6.6 nm). in contrast, the ic50 of  xxxd3492xxx  for
pde1 was 180 nm; for pde6, 11 nm; for pde2,  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4, more than 1000 nm. relative to
pde5, the ratios of the ic50 for pde1 were 257 (60), for pde6 16 (7.4).  xxxd3492xxx  significantly
enhanced the snp-induced relaxation of human trabecular smooth muscle at 3 nm (10 nm).
 xxxd3492xxx  also significantly potentiated both ach-induced and transmural electrical stimulationinduced relaxation of trabecular smooth muscle. the minimum concentration of  xxxd3492xxx  that
significantly potentiated snp-induced cgmp accumulation was 3 nm (30 nm). in vivo studies in
rabbits showed that orally administered  xxxd3492xxx  dose-dependently potentiated erectile
responses to intravenously administered snp. the minimal effective dose that significantly
potentiated erection was 0.1 mg=kg (1 mg=kg). the selectivity for pde5, the potentiation of noinduced relaxation and cgmp accumulation in human trabecular smooth muscle and the ability to
enhance no-induced erection in vivo indicate that  xxxd3492xxx  has the appropriate properties to be
a potential compound for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.  xxxd3492xxx  was more potent and
selective than sildenafil on its inhibitory activity on pde5. international journal of impotence

introduction
relaxation of arterial and trabecular smooth muscle
is needed to achieve and maintain penile erection.1
indeed, vascular diseases in which impaired vasodilator responses have been recognized are commonly associated with the development of erectile
dysfunction and impotence.2 ‚Äì 4

 xxxd2738xxx  (no) is a key mediator of penile
smooth muscle relaxation5 ‚Äì 8 and is released by
nonadrenergic, noncholinergic nerves within the
trabecular and penile arterial tissues as well as the
endothelia that line the lacunar spaces and the
intima of penile arteries.5 no synthase-like immunoreactivity has been identified in nerves and
endothelia in corpus cavernosum tissue, and the
activity of the no synthase has been characterized
in corpus cavernosum tissue homogenates.5 inhibitors of no synthase inhibit penile erection elicited
by the stimulation of the pelvic nerves.8,9
no exerts its relaxing action on corpus cavernosum and penile arteries by activating smooth muscle

tides, phosphodiesterases (pdes) are key regulatory
enzymes. eleven different families of pde isozymes
have been reported,11 with a specific distribution
pattern in different organs and species.12 the
existence and activity of four distinct pde isozymes
(pde2,  xxxg1695xxx , pde4 and pde5) in human corpus
cavernosum tissue has been described,13,14 although
mrnas from pde1,  xxxg1704xxx , pde8 and pde9 have also
been detected.15 four of these isozymes (pde1,
pde2, pde9 and pde5) being capable of hydrolyzing
cgmp, the latter is selective for this cyclic nucleotide at low km (michaelis ‚Äì menten constant).16
therefore, the inhibition of cgmp-specific pde
could be expected to enhance the no=cgmp signal
specifically during sexual stimulation and thus
facilitate penile smooth muscle relaxation.17
furthermore, it has been shown that pde5
inhibitors potentiate nonadrenergic, noncholinergic
nerve-mediated relaxation of trabecular smooth
muscle6,18,19 and enhance penile erection in animal
models20 ‚Äì 22 and patients.23
a high selectivity of the inhibitors for pde5 is
important since other pde isozymes also play key
regulatory roles in a number of systems and should
be not affected. with this purpose, new pharmacological agents more potent and selective for pde5,
such as  xxxd3492xxx , are being developed to treat
erectile dysfunction.
the objectives of this series of experiments were
to determine the potency and inhibitory selectivity
profile of  xxxd3492xxx  among pde-isozymes, to evaluate its ability to raise cgmp levels and to relax the
smooth muscle in human corpus cavernosum tissue,
and to determine its efficacy in causing erections in
an animal model.

methods
preparation of pde isozymes
bovine aorta and bovine heart were obtained freshly
from the local slaughter house. all subsequent steps
were performed at 2 ‚Äì 6 c. bovine heart was dissected from fat and connective tissue and minced
with a commercial meat grinder, suspended 1 : 5 in
buffer containing 20 mm k2hpo4 ph 6.8; 2 mm
edta; 2 mm  xxxd302xxx ; 3 mm  xxxd26xxx ; 5 mg=ml leupeptin; 5 mg=l antipain; 5 mg=l chymostatin; 2 mg=l trassylol; 0.085 mg=l pmsf. the
tissue was homogenized with a polytron pt 1200
homogenizer (kinematica ag, littau, switzerland).
the homogenate was centrifuged for 30 min at 40
000 g. the supernatant was recovered and filtered. a
similar procedure was used for the preparation of
soluble fractions from bovine aorta.
the supernatant of 400 g bovine heart extract was
stirred for 2 ‚Äì 3 h with 400 ml of deae-sephacel ci

(sigma). the deae-sephacel was allowed to settle,
the supernatant was decanted and the deaesephacel resuspended and stirred for 2 h in 1.5 l of
separation buffer (20 mm tris=hcl, ph 7.2; 2 mm
edta; 2 mm  xxxd302xxx ; 3 mm  xxxd26xxx ). the procedure was repeated with 600 ml of
separation buffer. finally, the deae-sephacel was
poured into a column 5 6 30 cm (pharmacia ltd,
sweden). the pde2,  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4 were eluted in
a nacl gradient (0 ‚Äì 0.8 m) in separation buffer at a
flow rate of 5 ml=min. fractions of 4 min were
collected and tested for their pde activity as
described below. the fractions comprising the
highest level of  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4 were frozen without
further purification and stored at 780 c. fractions
exerting pde2 activity were pooled, dialyzed with
separation buffer and rechromatographed on a
1.5 6 5 cm mono q-sepharose column (pharmacia
ltd, sweden). pde2 was eluted in nacl gradient
(0 ‚Äì 0.4 m) in separation buffer at a flow rate of
3 ml=min. fractions comprising the highest pde2
activity were frozen and stored at 780 c.
for the isolation of pde1, the soluble fraction of
200 g bovine aorta was adsorbed to 60 g deaesephacel and washed twice with 600 ml separation
buffer pde1=5 (20 mm kh2po4, ph 6.8; 2 mm
edta; 2 mm  xxxd302xxx ; 5 mm ddt) and poured
into a 5 6 30 cm column as described above. pde1
was eluted in a nacl gradient (0 ‚Äì 0.3 m) in separation buffer at a flow rate of 5 ml=min. fractions of
2.5 min were collected and tested for their pde
activity as described below. the pde1-containing
fractions were dialyzed against the pde1 separation
buffer and rechromatographed on a 1.5 6 5 cm qsepharose column (pharmacia ltd, sweden). pde1
was eluted in a linear nacl gradient at a flow rate of
3 ml=min. the fractions showing the highest pde1
activity were frozen at 780 c.
pde5 was isolated from human platelets. human
citrate blood (160 ml) was centrifuged at 126 g for
20 min; 56 ml of the supernatant was mixed with
14 ml of 44.8 mm sodium citrate, 20.9 mm citric
acid, 74.1 mm glucose. the platelets were spun
down at 370 g for 10 min and resuspended in 16 ml
of 20 mm hepes, ph 7.2, 0.25 m  xxxd3253xxx , 1 mm
edta, 1 mm pmsf, sonicated for 60 s (cooled with
ice) and centrifuged for 60 min at 75 000 g; 5 ml of
the supernatant was applied to a 0.5 6 5 cm mono
q cl-column (pharmacia ltd), equilibrated with
separation buffer a: 20 mm hepes, ph 7.2 √æ 1 mm
pmsf √æ 2 mm mgcl2. the column was washed for
20 min with 1 ml=min of separation buffer. pde5
was eluted in a gradient of nacl (0 ‚Äì 0.5 m) in 75min fractions of 1 ml. fractions 45 ‚Äì 52 containing
pde5 were frozen in 100-ml aliquots and stored at
780 c.
pde6 was purified from rod outer segments (ros)
of bovine retinae. dark adapted ros were mechanically broken at dim red light buffer a (10 mm

dtt) and centrifuged at 90 000 g (sorvall sw 28).
the membrane pellet containing pde6 was washed
three times with buffer a. pde6 was eluted from the
membrane by incubation in buffer b (10 mm
tris=hcl, ph 7.4, 0.2 mm mgcl2, 2 mm dtt) in
daylight. activation of pde6 was achieved by mild
trypsination for 25 min on ice (pde6 : trypsin 10 : 1
w=w). the reaction was stopped by addition of
soybean  xxxd207xxx  (sigma). trypsin-activated
pde6 was purified by anion exchange chromatography on a 0.5 6 5 cm mono q column (pharmacia
ltd) in a linear gradient (0 ‚Äì 0.5 m nacl in buffer b).
fractions containing trypsin-activated pde6 were
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 780 c.
the fractions of the pde isozymes were characterized based on their substrate specificity, effects
of calcium calmodulin, the effect of cgmp on their
hydrolytic activity or their inhibitory potency of
selective inhibitors. enzyme fractions exerting stimulation by 1 mm cgmp of at least factor four were
classified as pde2. fractions inhibited to more than
90% by cgmp and inhibited by milrinone with an
ic50 of about 0.5 mm were classified as  xxxg1695xxx . pde4
was selective for camp and was inhibited by
 xxxd3142xxx  with an ic50 of 0.3 mm. fractions hydrolyzing cgmp stimulated by calmodulin for at least
500% were classified as pde1. fractions which were
inhibited to more than 90% by sildenafil and did not
hydrolyze camp were classified as pde5.

enzyme inhibition
the commercially available 3h-camp and 3h-cgmp
scintillation proximity assay1 (spa) system from
amersham was used for enzyme inhibition studies.
all tests were done in duplicate and were repeated
at least three times. for pde1 assays 3 mm cacl2
and 0.1 mm calmodulin were added. pde2 assays
were performed with 3h-camp as substrate and
1 mm cgmp for the activation of the enzyme.  xxxg1695xxx 
and pde4 assays were done with 3h-camp, pde5
assays with 3h-cgmp as substrate. these compounds were added in dmso (final concentration
of dmso 0.1%). incubation period was 15 min at
30 c. this method was used for additional enzyme
inhibition assays using human recombinant pde1c,
 xxxg1694xxx ,  xxxg1696xxx ,  xxxg1698xxx ,  xxxg1701xxx ,  xxxg1705xxx  and pde10,
cloned by g gallo, (bayer, west haven, germany).
pde8 and pde9 were of murine origin; the cdnas
were kindly provided by ja beavo. the enzymes
were expressed in a baculovirus sf9 system by h
apeler, u bruÃàggemeier (bayer, wuppertal, germany).
activity of highly purified trypsin-activated bovine pde6 was measured using the commercially
available scintillation proximity assay system from
amersham, adding unlabelled cgmp to a final
concentration of 10 mm. the incubation period was
international journal of impotence research

10 min at 30 c, and  xxxd3492xxx  and sildenafil were
added 5 min prior to the addition of the enzyme.
the ic50 values for the pde inhibition were
determined from sigmoidal curves, fitted to plots
of enzyme activity vs log compound concentration
using a graphpad (san diego, ca, usa) curve fitting
program.

human corpus cavernosum tissues
human corpus cavernosum strips were obtained
from impotent men at the time of penile prosthesis
insertion. tissues were maintained at 4 ‚Äì 6 c in m400 solution (composition per 100 ml: mannitol,
4.19 g; kh2po4, 0.205 g; k2hpo43h3o, 0.97 g; kcl,
0.112 g; nahco3, 0.084 g) until used (2 ‚Äì 16 h after
extraction).24

organ chamber studies
strips of corpus cavernosum tissue (3 6 3 6 7 mm)
were immersed in 8-ml organ chambers containing
physiological salt solution (pss) in mm: nacl 119,
kcl 4.6, cacl2 1.5, mgcl2 1.2, nahco3 24.9, glucose
11, kh2po4 1.2, edta 0.027 at 37 c, continuously
gased with 95% o2=5% co2 mixture to maintain a
ph of 7.4. each tissue strip was incrementally
stretched to optimal isometric tension, as determined by maximal contractile response to 1 mm
phenylephrine.5,7 preparations were then exposed
to 125 mm k√æ (kpss, equimolar substitution of
nacl for kcl in pss). contraction was elicited by
1 mm phenylephrine, and relaxation responses were
evaluated by cumulative additions of compounds to
the chambers. transmural electrical stimulation
(tes) was applied by means of two platinum
electrodes on each side of the tissue, connected to
a stimulator and a current amplifier (cibertec,
madrid, spain). parameters of tes were square
pulses of 0.5 ms, during 15 s with the voltage
adjusted to obtain a current of 75 ma. responses to
tes were evaluated at increasing frequencies (0.5, 1,
2, 6 and 12 hz). in all experiments, strips were
incubated with atropine (0.1 mm) and  xxxd2243xxx 
(10 mm) 45 min before contraction with phenylephrine. treatments were added 30 min before evaluation of tes-induced responses. relaxation
responses are expressed as percentage of total
relaxation (loss in tone) induced by the addition of
0.1 mm  xxxd2842xxx  to the chambers at the end
of the experiment. all data are expressed as mean  standard error of the mean (s.e.m.).

incubate for 30 min. after this tissues were treated
with drugs or vehicles for 5 min, then immediately
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 780 c until
extraction for cyclic nucleotide assay. tissues were
extracted by homogenization in 6% trichloroacetic
acid, followed by ether (h2o-saturated) extraction
and lyophilization. the amount of cgmp was
determined by elisa using a kit from cayman
chemical co. (ann arbor, mi, usa).

drugs and materials
acetylcholine chloride, phenylephrine,  xxxd2243xxx , and snp were obtained from sigma chemical
co. (st louis, mo, usa).  xxxd247xxx  was
obtained from braun (germany). sildenafil and
 xxxd3492xxx  were provided by bayer (ag pharma
chemical research, wuppertal, germany). all drugs
were dissolved in deionized water, except sildenafil
and  xxxd3492xxx , which were dissolved  xxxd1891xxx  mm

proteins were determined using the bio-rad protein
assay kit microtiter plate assay procedure (bio-rad,
hercules, ca, usa) with bovine  xxxg124xxx  as
standard.

measurement of penile erections in a conscious
rabbit model
the method has been described elsewhere.22 in
brief, adult male chinchilla rabbits with an average
weight of 3.5 ‚Äì 4.5 kg were used. the rabbits were
housed individually, and food and drink were
available ad libitum for 2 h in the morning and 2 h
in the afternoon. the rabbit penis is not visible
when it is not erect.25 however, when an erection
occurs, it is possible to examine the pudendal area
and measure the length of uncovered penile mucosa
with sliding calipers. for this study, measurements
were made at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 65, 70, 75, 90,
105 and 120 min after administration of the test
compounds, respectively. mean values of the length
of exposed penile mucosa were calculated along
with the s.e.m. the mean length was plotted against
time, and the area under the curve (auc) was
calculated by an integration program (graphpad
software, san diego, ca, usa).
each dose group consisted of six animals, which
were used in a cross-over design for several studies.
the time interval between studies was at least eight
days. for oral administration, the respective compound was dissolved in a mixture of glycerol : water :  xxxd2982xxx  6 : 10 : 9.69 and given in a
volume of 1 ml=kg by gavage. controls were per-

potency and selectivity profile of  xxxd3492xxx  against
different pde isozymes
the ic50 values of  xxxd3492xxx  for the different
isozymes are shown in table 1.  xxxd3492xxx  inhibited
pde5 from human platelets at subnanomolar concentrations, a potency approximately 10-fold higher
than that of sildenafil (see table 1).  xxxd3492xxx  was
16-fold less potent against pde6 and showed
moderate activity against pde1 from bovine aorta
and very low potency against the pde2,  xxxg1695xxx  and
pde4 from bovine heart.
the potency of  xxxd3492xxx  in inhibiting pde5 from
bovine tissues and the selectivity profile against
other pdes was confirmed by the data obtained with
human recombinant pdes (table 2).

treatment with tetrodotoxin (1 mm) and were not
affected by the treatment with vehicle (data not

the relaxation of human trabecular smooth muscle to

 xxxd3492xxx  alone significantly augmented the
amount of cgmp in corpus cavernosum at a
concentration of 30 nm (figure 4a). snp alone at
1 mm increased the amount of cgmp about 2-fold.
 xxxd3492xxx  was found to significantly enhance this
accumulation at the lowest concentration tested,
3 nm (figure 4b). sildenafil at 30 nm also produced
a statistically significant potentiation of cgmp
accumulation induced by 1 mm snp, but not at 3
or 10 nm (figure 4b).

nously there was a brief and small response with a
mean increment in penile length of 5 mm (figure 5).
when  xxxd3492xxx  was administered orally, there was
no response for the first hour for the 0.3 mg=kg dose,
but a small reponse was observed at the 1 mg=kg
dose. after 60 min, when snp was given intravenously, there was an immediate potentiation of the
snp effect, producing an erection with a maximum
length of 20 mm for the 1 mg=kg dose (figure 5a).
the time to onset of action was similar to that of
snp alone. when erectile responses were expressed
as auc (mm 6 min), the effects induced by snp
were significantly enhanced by  xxxd3492xxx  at all
tested doses. sildenafil also potentiated the erectile
response to snp at the oral dose of 1 mg=kg, but not
at lower doses (figure 6).

discussion
inhibition of pde5 activity in human penile smooth
muscle is able to treat many men with erectile
dysfunction.26 the benefit of pde5 inhibition is
from the enhancement of the increase of cgmp
concentration caused by the action of no, which is
released from nonadrenergic, noncholinergic nerves
during sexual arousal and also from the endothelium of penile arteries and lacunar spaces,5 further
facilitating smooth muscle relaxation6,7 and penile
erection.8,19 impaired relaxation of penile smooth
muscle results in erectile dysfunction.3 indeed,

 xxxd3492xxx  is a new pde5 inhibitor currently
under clinical development. it has been shown to be
a well tolerated29,30 and effective oral treatment for
male erectile dysfunction in preliminary studies.30 ‚Äì
33 in this study, we have characterized the activity of
 xxxd3492xxx  in vitro and in vivo and compared it with
that of sildenafil, which has been shown previously
to potentiate no-mediated relaxation of trabecular
smooth muscle19 and to enhance penile erections in
animal models21 and patients.22

figure 6 erectile response after oral administration of sildenafil
and  xxxd3492xxx  in the indicated doses, followed by an injection of
0.2 mg=kg of snp, was expressed as the product of the time (min)
and the length of the uncovered penile mucosa (mm), representing the area under the curve (auc). the period of time 0 ‚Äì 120 min
was used for the calculation. data are expressed as mean  s.e.m.,
n ¬º 6. *p < 0.05. **p < 0.01 vs snp by one-way anova followed

according to these studies,  xxxd3492xxx  is a highly
selective pde5 inhibitor with a potency about 10fold higher than that of sidenafil. the selective effect
exerted by  xxxd3492xxx  on pde5 activity is important
to minimize possible side effects at the estimated
therapeutic doses for the treatment of erectile
dysfunction. the closest ic50 values were for pde1
and pde6. the other pdes were all minimally
affected by  xxxd3492xxx , with ic50 values greater than
1000-fold more than for pde5.  xxxd3492xxx  has over
200-fold less effect on pde1 compared with pde5.
assays with pde6 using a cgmp concentration of

10 mm were performed because of the difference in
the ic50 values for sildenafil obtained under the
different conditions in previously published studies.19,34 independent of the different substrate
concentrations,  xxxd3492xxx  was 2-fold more selective
than sildenafil. the potency and selectivity for pde5
is similar in inhibition assays with tissue extracted
enzymes and in those with human recombinant
enzymes.
according to its mechanism of action as a pde5
inhibitor,  xxxd3492xxx  was capable of amplifying
relaxant responses elicited by agents that stimulate
the no=cgmp pathway.  xxxd3492xxx  enhanced the
relaxation of human trabecular smooth muscle
produced by snp, an exogenous source of no,
showing efficacy at concentrations as low  xxxd79xxx   xxxd1710xxx  nm.
also  xxxd3492xxx  enhanced neurogenic relaxation and
endothelium-dependent ach-induced relaxation of
cavernosal strips.
the results in functional analysis of smooth
muscle relaxation had further confirmation in the
data from the determination of cyclic nucleotide
content in cavernosal tissue, where 3 nm  xxxd3492xxx 
was able to significantly enhance the increase in
cgmp level. a 10-fold higher concentration of
sildenafil was necessary to produce a similar effect.
taken together, these results demonstrate that
 xxxd3492xxx  is an efficient enhancer of the nomediated relaxation of human trabecular smooth
muscle, probably by increasing cgmp accumulation
in this tissue. of note, the potentiation of nomediated relaxation in penile smooth muscle is
produced at concentrations of  xxxd3492xxx  below the
free plasma levels of this molecule in man after oral
administration of 20 mg.29,30 potentiation of the
no=cgmp pathway by  xxxd3492xxx  has clinical
relevance because it could allow a more effective
penile smooth muscle relaxation when active release of no is produced in response to sexual
arousal.
the results observed in human trabecular smooth
muscle have a correlation with results obtained in
vivo using a conscious rabbit model to determine
erectile responses. oral  xxxd3492xxx  is efficacious in
improving penile erections induced by snp, and the
effective doses are in the range of doses which are
under clinical investigation. in this model, the
higher potency  xxxd3492xxx  with respect to sildenafil
in this animal model may be explained by its higher
efficacy in increasing cgmp content and nomediated relaxation of trabecular smooth muscle.
in conclusion, our studies clearly demonstrate
that  xxxd3492xxx  is a potent and selective inhibitor of
pde5.  xxxd3492xxx  enhances penile smooth muscle
relaxation induced by exogenous and endogenous
no. furthermore, when orally administered,  xxxd3492xxx  enhances potently no-mediated penile erection in an animal model.  xxxd3492xxx  is consistently
more potent and also more selective for pde5 than
sildenafil. these data suggest that  xxxd3492xxx  may

have the biochemical and physiological characteristics necessary for treating erectile dysfunction. in
phase ii trials the clinical efficacy of  xxxd3492xxx  in
treatment of patients with erectile dysfunction has
been demonstrated.30 ‚Äì 33
