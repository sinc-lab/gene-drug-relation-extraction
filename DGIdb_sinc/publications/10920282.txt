tzt-1027, a derivative of  xxxd1925xxx  isolated from the indian ocean sea hare dolabella auricularia in 1987 by pettit et al., is a potent antimicrotubule agent. we have compared the activity of
tzt-1027 with that of  xxxd1925xxx  as well as the vinca alkaloids vinblastine (vlb), vincristine
(vcr) and  xxxd3513xxx  (vds). tzt-1027 and  xxxd1925xxx  inhibited microtubule polymerization
concentration-dependently at 1–100 µm with ic50 values of 2.2 ± 0.6 and 2.3 ± 0.7 µm, respectively.
vlb, vcr and vds inhibited microtubule polymerization at 1–3 µm with ic50 values of 2.7 ± 0.6,
1.6 ± 0.4 and 1.6 ± 0.2 µm, respectively, but showed a slight decrease in inhibitory effect at concentrations of 10 µm or more. tzt-1027 also inhibited monosodium glutamate-induced tubulin
polymerization concentration-dependently at 0.3–10 µm, with an ic50 of 1.2 µm, whereas vlb was
only effective at 0.3–3 µm, with an ic50 of 0.6 µm, and caused so-called “aggregation” of tubulin at
10 µm. scatchard analysis of the binding data for [3h]vlb suggested one binding site (kd 0.2 ± 0.04
µm and bmax 6.0±
± 0.26 nm/mg protein), while that for [3h]tzt-1027 suggested two binding sites,
one of high affinity (kd 0.2 ± 0.01 µm and bmax 1.7 ± 0.012 nm/mg protein) and the other of low
affinity (kd 10.3 ± 1.46 µm and bmax 11.6 ± 0.83 nm/mg protein). [3h]tzt-1027 was completely
displaced by  xxxd1925xxx  but only incompletely by vlb. [3h]vlb was completely displaced by
 xxxd1925xxx  and tzt-1027. furthermore, tzt-1027 prevented [3h]vlb from binding to tubulin
in a non-competitive manner according to lineweaver-burk analysis. tzt-1027 concentrationdependently inhibited both [3h]guanosine 5′′-triphosphate (gtp) binding to and gtp hydrolysis on
tubulin. vlb inhibited the hydrolysis of gtp on tubulin concentration-dependently to a lesser extent
than tzt-1027, but no inhibitory effect of vlb on [3h]gtp binding to tubulin was evident even at
100 µm. thus, tzt-1027 affected the binding of vlb to tubulin, but its binding site was not
completely identical to that of vlb. tzt-1027 had a potent inhibitory effect on tubulin polymerization and differed from vinca alkaloids in its mode of action against tubulin polymerization.

tzt-1027—microtubule polymerization—tubulin binding—antimicrotubule agent—

 xxxd1925xxx  was isolated from the indian ocean sea

exhibits cytotoxicity in vitro and is effective in vivo
against transplantable tumors in mice.2–4) as with vinca
alkaloids,5–8) these activities of  xxxd1925xxx  are due to its
binding to tubulin and inhibition of the assembly of microtubules in cells.9–11) tzt-1027, a derivative of dolastatin
10, has greater antitumor activity and less toxicity than its
mother compound.12) the chemical structure of tzt-1027
is shown in fig. 1. the i.v. injection of tzt-1027 was
found to increase life span and to inhibit remarkably the
growth of p388 leukemia and three solid tumors (colon 26
adenocarcinoma, b16 melanoma and m5076 sarcoma) in
mice, with an efficacy superior or comparable to those of
several reference agents;  xxxd1925xxx , cisplatin, vincristine (vcr) and 5-fluorouracil.13) tzt-1027 was also effective against human xenografts, that is, tumor regression

was observed in mice bearing mx-1 breast and lx-1 lung
carcinomas.13) because of its good preclinical activity, tzt1027 has been entered into phase i clinical trials in japan.
microtubule proteins are important in mitosis, but in
addition, their main components, tubulins, are critical to
many facets of cellular function. they provide support for
organelles and membranes, resist compressive forces, provide tracks for vesicular transport and sorting, and contribute motile force for cell locomotion in conjunction with
actin filaments.14, 15)
antimicrotubule agents interfere with the dynamics of
microtubules and act as inhibitors of cell division. indeed,
several such agents, including paclitaxel (ptx), are clinically useful antitumor agents.
here we describe a detailed investigation of the interaction of tzt-1027 with tubulin. tzt-1027 potently inhibited the polymerization of microtubule proteins and also
purified tubulin, greatly inhibited the binding of radiolabeled vinca alkaloids and radiolabeled guanosine 5′-triphosphate (gtp) to tubulin, and inhibited gtp hydroly-

ptx was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) and
diluted with distilled water (dw). the final concentration
of dmso used in experiments was 0.5%. colchicine was
dissolved in and diluted with dw.
preparation of microtubule proteins and purification of
tubulin from porcine brain microtubule proteins were
prepared from porcine brain by the method of shelanski et
al. with some modifications.16) briefly, porcine microtubule proteins were isolated by two cycles of polymerization and depolymerization, and stored as pellets frozen at
−80°c in assembly buffer containing 100 mm 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (mes) (ph 6.9), 2 mm ethyleneglycol bis(2-aminoethylether)tetraacetic acid (egta), 1 mm
 xxxd2534xxx ·7h2o and 2 mm dithiothreitol (dtt). purification
of tubulin from microtubule proteins was carried out by
the method of williams and lee with some modifications.17) tubulin was separated from microtubule associated proteins (maps) by phosphocellulose (whatman p11;

738

whatman, maidstone, uk) chromatography at 4°c. samples of microtubule proteins in assembly buffer were
slowly loaded on a 2.5×35 cm column which had previously been extensively equilibrated with assembly buffer
containing 0.1 mm gtp. the pure tubulin was eluted from
the column with assembly buffer containing 0.1 mm gtp
at a flow rate of 15 ml/h. the protein was stored in aliquots (2 ml) at −80°c. protein concentrations were determined by the method of bradford18) (bio-rad protein
assay; bio-rad, hercules, ca) using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a protein standard.  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described
previously19) to confirm that a single band with a molecular weight of 50 kd was obtained.
effects on polymerization of microtubules assays were
performed as described by bai et al.8) briefly, the polymerizing reaction mixtures were composed of 3.0 mg of
homogeneous porcine brain microtubule proteins, 100 mm
mes (ph 6.9), 0.5 mm mgcl2, 0.5 mm gtp and various
concentrations of agents in a volume of 2.0 ml. all components except gtp were mixed and chilled on ice for 10
min. immediately after addition of gtp, the polymerizing
reaction mixtures were transferred to a spectrophotometer
equipped with an electronic temperature controller
(uvidec-610c; jasco corp., tokyo). baselines were
established with the cuvettes at 0°c and reactions were
initiated by a temperature jump up to 37°c. polymerization was followed by turbidity measurements for 30 min at
37°c. experiments were carried out more than three times.
ic50 values were determined as the concentration of agents
required to suppress polymerization by 50% after 30-min
incubation.
effects on polymerization of purified tubulin assays
were also performed as described by bai et al.8) with
minor modifications. briefly, the polymerizing reaction
mixtures were composed of 1.8 mg of bovine brain tubulin
(dissolved in assembly buffer), 1.0 m monosodium
glutamate (ph 6.8), 1 mm mgcl2, 1 mm egta, 0.5 mm
gtp and various concentrations of agents in a volume of
1.8 ml. the reactions were initiated by the addition of
gtp and the mixtures were immediately transferred to a
spectrophotometer equipped with an electronic temperature controller (uvidec-610c; jasco corp.), which
was prewarmed to 37°c. baselines were established with
the cuvettes at 0°c, and reactions were monitored for 30
min at 37°c. the ic50 values were determined as the concentration of agents required to suppress polymerization
by 50% after 30-min incubation.
effects of radiolabeled agents on tubulin assays were
performed as described by mandelbaum-shavit et al.20)
and borisy et al.21) with slight modifications. reaction
mixtures containing 0.02 mg of porcine brain tubulin, nonradiolabeled agents and radiolabeled agents ([3h]tzt1027, [3h]vlb or [3h]colchicine) in a volume of 0.2 ml

were incubated for various periods at 37°c, and chilled on
ice for 10 min. aliquots (100 µl) were dropped onto
deae-cellulose filters (de81; whatman), which were
washed twice with the ice-cold assembly buffer described
above, and the radioactivity on filters was measured using
a liquid scintillation counter (lsc-900; aloka, tokyo)
after applying clear-sol i (nacalai tesque inc.). tzt-1027
was dissolved in ethanol and diluted with dw. dolastatin
10 was dissolved in dmso and diluted with dw. vlb,
vcr and colchicine were dissolved in and diluted with
dw.
effects on gtp binding to tubulin the reaction mixtures containing 0.05 mg of porcine brain tubulin dissolved in assembly buffer, and non-radiolabeled agents
were applied to membrane filter plates (ip filter; millipore
corp., bedford, ma) and incubated for 30 min at 37°c.
then 1 µm [3h]gtp in a volume of 0.25 ml was applied
to the plates and incubation was continued for an additional 15 min at 0°c. the plates were washed twice with
ice-cold assembly buffer and the radioactivity on filters
was measured with a liquid scintillation counter (lsc900; aloka) after applying clear-sol i (nacalai tesque
inc.). tzt-1027 and dolastatin 15 were dissolved in ethanol and diluted with dw.  xxxd1925xxx  was dissolved in
dmso and diluted with dw. vlb was dissolved in and
diluted with dw.
effects against gtp hydrolysis on tubulin assays were
performed as described by hamel and lin.22) the reaction
mixtures containing 0.2 mg of porcine brain tubulin dissolved in assembly buffer, non-radiolabeled agents and 10
µm [3h]gtp and 1 µm monosodium glutamate (ph 6.8)
in a volume of 0.1 ml were incubated for 15 min at 37°c
and the reactions were stopped by adding 10 µl of 20%
acetic acid to aliquots (10 µl) of the reaction mixtures.
then, 10-µl aliquots of the stopped reaction mixtures were
spotted upon pei-cellulose thin-layer chromatography
sheets (merck, frankfurt, germany) and developed with
1.0 m kh2po4. after searching for bands of gdp by
exposing the filters to ultraviolet, the radioactivity was
measured with a liquid scintillation counter (aloka ;
lsc-900) after applying clear-sol i (nacalai tesque inc.).
treatment with agents was performed as described above.
effects of the combination of tzt-1027 and ptx on
polymerization of microtubule proteins
stabilizing effects of ptx against depolymerization
induced by cacl2: the polymerizing reaction mixtures
were composed of 3.0 mg of homogeneous porcine brain
microtubule protein, 100 mm mes (ph 6.9), 0.5 mm
mgcl2, 0.5 mm gtp and various concentrations of ptx in
a volume of 2.0 ml. all components except gtp were
mixed and chilled on ice for 10 min. immediately after
addition of gtp, the polymerizing reaction mixtures were
transferred to a spectrophotometer equipped with an electronic temperature controller (uvidec-610c; jasco

corp.). baselines were established with the cuvettes at
0°c, and reactions were initiated by a temperature jump
up to 37°c. polymerization was followed by turbidity
measurements for 30 min at 37°c. after addition of 20 µl
of 400 mm cacl2 at 30 min, depolymerization was carried
out for an additional 15 min. experiments were conducted
twice. the ic50 values were determined as the concentration of ptx required to suppress the depolymerization
induced by 4 mm cacl2 by 50% after 15-min incubation.
the combination effects of tzt-1027 or vlb and ptx:
the polymerizing reaction mixtures were composed of 3.0
mg of homogeneous porcine brain microtubule protein,
100 mm mes (ph 6.9), 0.5 mm mgcl2, 0.5 mm gtp and
3 µm tzt-1027 (or 3 µm vlb) and 1 µm ptx in a volume of 2.0 ml. the combinations of agents were: 1) simultaneous addition of tzt-1027 (or vlb) and ptx and
preincubation for 10 min, 2) addition of tzt-1027 (or
vlb), preincubation for 5 min, then addition of ptx and
preincubation for 5 min, and 3) as in 2), but with opposite
order of addition. the polymerization was initiated by
immediately adding gtp and transferring to the device at
37°c as described above. experiments were carried out
three times. the effects of combination were determined
as the decrease in turbidity (∆a350) versus the agentuntreated control at 30 min.
results

inhibition of polymerization of microtubule proteins by
tzt-1027 to monitor the effects of antimicrotubule
agents, we used the turbidity method and monitored the
absorbance at 350 nm (a350) for 30 min after the addition
of gtp and the temperature jump to 37°c. the inhibitory
effect was identified from the ratio of the increase of a350
(∆a350) in the agent-treated compared to the untreated fraction. as is shown in fig. 2, a and b, tzt-1027 and  xxxd1925xxx  inhibited the polymerization of microtubule
proteins concentration-dependently at 1–100 µm with ic50
values of 2.2±0.6 and 2.3±0.7 µm, respectively.
on the other hand, as shown in fig. 3, a, b, and c,
vlb, vcr and vds inhibited the polymerization only at
1–3 µm with ic50 values of 2.7±0.6, 1.6±0.4 and 1.6±0.2
µm, respectively, and at concentrations of 10 µm or
more, showed a slight decrease in inhibitory effect. thus,
tubulin binding by tzt-1027 and vinca alkaloids may be
different.
dolastatin 15 also inhibited the polymerization of
microtubule proteins concentration-dependently  xxxd1891xxx –100
µm with an ic50 of 23.7±1.9 µm (fig. 3d), being the
weakest inhibitor investigated here. almost the same ic50
value was obtained by bai et al.23)
inhibition of tubulin polymerization by tzt-1027 we
examined the effect of tzt-1027 on tubulin polymerization to verify that its target is tubulin. as shown in fig. 4a,

of 0.6 µm, and caused so-called “aggregation” of tubulin

tzt-1027 and vinca alkaloids were different.

[3h]tzt-1027 bound to tubulin time-dependently and the
reaction reached a plateau in 20 min (data not shown).

741

jpn. j. cancer res. 91, july 2000

therefore, we fixed the incubation time for [3h]tzt-1027
at 30 min.
scatchard analysis of [3h]tzt-1027 and [3h]vlb binding suggested that tzt-1027 has two different binding
sites on tubulin (fig. 5a), with a dissociation constant (kd
value) of 0.2±0.01 µm and bmax value of 1.7±0.012 nm/
mg protein for the high-affinity site and values of
10.3±1.46 µm and 11.6±0.83 nm/mg protein for the lowaffinity site, whereas vlb has only one binding site (fig.
5b), with a kd value of 0.2±0.04 µm and bmax value of
6.0±0.26 nm/mg protein.
we examined the displacement curves of non-radiolabeled tzt-1027,  xxxd1925xxx , vlb, vcr and colchicine
with [3h]tzt-1027 and [3h]vlb on tubulin. as shown
in fig. 6, tzt-1027 and  xxxd1925xxx  concentrationdependently displaced [3h]vlb on tubulin.  xxxd1925xxx 
concentration-dependently displaced [3h]tzt-1027 on
tubulin. on the other hand, while vlb and vcr could
displace it, the displacement was not complete even at 100
µm. colchicine had no effect on either [3h]tzt-1027 or
[3h]vlb binding on tubulin. lineweaver-burk plot analysis of tzt-1027 and [3h]vlb on tubulin revealed the
binding to be non-competitive (fig. 7).
inhibition of gtp binding on tubulin by tzt-1027
ordinarily, 2 mol of gtp binds to 1 mol of tubulin and is
easily exchangeable with gtp or gdp. in order to poly-

merize microtubules from tubulin, it is necessary for gtp
to bind at this exchangeable gtp binding site, where it is
hydrolyzed to gdp. as shown in figs. 5a and 6, tzt-1027
 xxxd1740xxx , so we investigated its effect on gtp
binding and hydrolysis on tubulin.
inhibition of the binding of [3h]gtp on tubulin by various agents is illustrated in fig. 8. tzt-1027 and dolastatin
10 showed concentration-dependent inhibition of the binding of gtp to tubulin. this may explain the inhibitory
effects on the polymerization of purified tubulin of these
two agents. further, the binding sites of these agents on
tubulin are close to that of gtp. on the other hand, dolastatin 15 and vlb showed only slight inhibitory effects at
higher concentrations.
inhibition of gtp hydrolysis on tubulin by tzt-1027
as is shown in fig. 9, tzt-1027,  xxxd1925xxx , dolastatin
15 and vlb showed concentration-dependent inhibition of

were more effective than dolastatin 15 and vlb.
the effect of the combination of tzt-1027 and ptx on
the polymerization of microtubule proteins first, we
investigated the stabilizing effects of ptx on microtubules. as shown in fig. 10, ptx increased the maximum
amount of polymerized microtubules to some extent. in
the ptx-untreated control fraction, in which the vehicle
(0.5% dmso) was applied to the polymerizing reaction
mixture for 30 min, the addition of 4 mm cacl2 had a
depolymerizing effect of 85.2%. however, ptx concentration-dependently inhibited the depolymerizing effect
induced by 4 mm cacl2. in the 10 µm ptx-treated fraction, the depolymerization amounted to only 12.9%. the
ic50 value for the inhibitory effect of ptx on depolymerization was 1.3 µm.
next, we investigated the combination effect of tzt1027 or vlb and ptx on microtubule polymerization.
the concentrations of tzt-1027, vlb and ptx were
fixed at 3, 3 and 1 µm, respectively, because, as shown in
figs. 2a, 3a, and 10, the ic50 values of these agents were
calculated to be 2.2, 2.7 and 1.3 µm, respectively.

as shown in fig. 11, when only 3 µm tzt-1027 was
applied, a potent inhibition, 78.6%, of microtubule polymerization was observed. cotreatment with tzt-1027 and
ptx produced a modest inhibition of about 50%, regardless of the order in which these agents were added. the
inhibition was less than with tzt-1027 alone.
similar results were obtained with the combination of
vlb and ptx. as shown in fig. 12, when 3 µm vlb
alone was applied, microtubule polymerization was inhibited 64.7%, while cotreatment with vlb and ptx caused
less than 50% inhibition, regardless of the order in which
the agents were added.
discussion

we have reported the potent antitumor activity of tzt1027 against a variety of transplantable tumors in mice.13)
the intracellular target of  xxxd1925xxx , the mother compound of tzt-1027, was reported to be tubulin, the major
component of microtubule proteins.8–11) therefore, we
have investigated the activity of tzt-1027 on microtubule
proteins, especially tubulin.

743

jpn. j. cancer res. 91, july 2000

tzt-1027 inhibited the polymerization of microtubule
proteins concentration-dependently at 1–100 µm with an
ic50 value of 2.2 µm. on the other hand, vlb, vcr and
vds inhibited it only at 1–3 µm with ic50 values of 2.7,
1.6 and 1.6 µm, respectively, and at concentrations of 10
µm or more, a decrease in inhibitory effect was observed
with all three vinca alkaloids. in a previous study,13) we
found no such decrease in the inhibitory effect of vlb,
even at relatively high concentrations, in the same experimental system. however, further study using additional
lots of purified microtubule proteins revealed that vlb
also showed a decrease in inhibitory effect at concentrations of 10 µm or more. therefore, the three vinca
alkaloids appear to behave similarly. it is known that
when vinca alkaloids are added to microtubule proteins,
constructions different from normal microtubules are
observed.7, 8, 11) thus, the modes of tubulin binding of
tzt-1027 and vinca alkaloids may be different.
we investigated the activity of tzt-1027 for polymerization of purified tubulin to verify whether or not the
target of tzt-1027 is tubulin. tzt-1027 inhibited
monosodium glutamate-induced tubulin polymerization
concentration-dependently at 0.3–10 µm with an ic50
value of 1.2 µm.  xxxd1925xxx  inhibited it concentrationdependently at 1–3 µm with an ic50 of 2.8 µm, but no
further increase in inhibition was observed at concentrations of 10 µm or more in 0.005 m lactate buffer. bai et
al. reported that  xxxd1925xxx  inhibited monosodium
glutamate-induced tubulin polymerization concentrationdependently from 0.5–3 µm with an ic50 of 1.2 µm in 4%
dmso.8) hence, we carried out the same experiment with
 xxxd1925xxx  in 4% dmso. we found that 3 µm  xxxd1925xxx  showed 88% inhibition of monosodium glutamateinduced tubulin polymerization (data not shown). the reason for the discrepancy in the activity levels of dolastatin
10 in the two solvents is unclear. at concentrations of 10
µm or more,  xxxd1925xxx  itself without tubulin was not
precipitated in 0.005 m lactate buffer as determined using
a spectrophotometer. on the other hand, vlb inhibited
monosodium glutamate-induced tubulin polymerization
only at 0.3–3 µm with an ic50 value of 0.6 µm, and it
caused so-called “aggregation” of tubulin  xxxd1891xxx  µm. this
phenomenon has been reported in many papers,7, 8, 11) and
we suggest that constructions different from normal microtubules are formed. this confirms the idea that the modes
of binding of tzt-1027 and vinca alkaloids to tubulin are
different.
scatchard analysis using [3h]tzt-1027 and [3h]vlb
revealed tzt-1027 to have two different binding sites on
tubulin, high and low affinity sites, and vlb to have only
one. the kd and bmax of [3h]vlb were similar to previously reported values.24) iwasaki et al. suggested that  xxxd1925xxx  has two or more binding sites on tubulin from
scatchard analysis.11, 25) bai et al. reported a similar find-

744

ing.26) hence, it is reasonable to conclude that tzt-1027
has two binding sites on tubulin.
from examination of the displacement curves of nonradiolabeled tzt-1027,  xxxd1925xxx , vlb, vcr and
colchicine against [3h]tzt-1027 and [3h]vlb on tubulin,
tzt-1027 and  xxxd1925xxx  displaced [3h]vlb concentration-dependently.  xxxd1925xxx  also displaced [3h]tzt1027 concentration-dependently on tubulin, while vlb
and vcr could also displace it, but not completely, even
at a high concentration of 100 µm. lineweaver-burk plot
analysis of the effect of tzt-1027 on [3h]vlb binding
to tubulin revealed a non-competitive effect. bai et al.
reported that  xxxd1925xxx  reacted with tubulin in the same
fashion as vlb.27) our data suggest that tzt-1027 binds
to tubulin at a site different from that of colchicine.
although tzt-1027 can interact with vlb with respect to
tubulin binding, the binding sites of tzt-1027 and vlb
are not completely identical with each other.
we have also investigated the effects of ptx and dolastatin 15 on the bindings of radiolabeled tzt-1027 and
vlb to tubulin. ptx and dolastatin 15 did not have
remarkable inhibitory effects (data not shown). it was
reported that dolastatin 15 bound tubulin as efficiently as
 xxxd1925xxx , but did not interfere with the binding of
 xxxd1925xxx  or vlb.27) therefore, it is interesting that
dolastatin 15 does not interfere with tzt-1027 binding.
tzt-1027 seems to have a different binding site on
tubulin from those of ptx and dolastatin 15.
tzt-1027,  xxxd1925xxx , dolastatin 15 and vlb inhibited the hydrolysis of gtp on tubulin concentrationdependently. tzt-1027 and  xxxd1925xxx  also inhibited
the binding of gtp to tubulin, but dolastatin 15 and vlb
had no such effect. bai et al. reported similar results for
 xxxd1925xxx  and vlb.26) huang et al. reported that vlb
had an inhibitory effect on the binding of gtp to tubulin
only above 100 µm.28) therefore our findings are consistent with previous results. consequently, the difference in
the effect of the two agents on gtp binding to tubulin can
be attributed to a difference of binding site. we speculate
that the binding site for tzt-1027 on tubulin partly overlaps that for gtp.
antimicrotubule agents can be divided into two groups,
microtubule-disrupting agents and microtubule-stabilizing
agents. the former group is thought to act against cancer
cells by disrupting microtubules, namely inhibiting the
polymerization of tubulin. tzt-1027,  xxxd1925xxx  and
vinca alkaloids are included in this group. in contrast,
microtubule-stabilizing agents inhibit the depolymerization
of polymerized tubulin. ptx,29–31) epothilones32–34) and
discodermolides35–37) are members of this group.
in the clinical field, the importance of combinations of
these two kinds of agents is being recognized. reports
have appeared on their effects against cancer cell lines in
vitro, transplantable cancer cells in vivo and various kinds

interaction of tzt-1027 with tubulin

of cancer cells from patients.38–42) however, few reports
have dealt with combinations of the antimicrotubule
agents having different effects on the polymerization of
microtubules. therefore, we carried out a basic study on
combining two agents, tzt-1027 or vlb and ptx. first,
we investigated the stabilizing effect of ptx itself on the
depolymerization induced by cacl2. ptx had a concentration-dependent stabilizing effect with an ic50 value of 1.3
µm. schiff et al. reported that 0.1–5 µm ptx had a stabilizing effect against depolymerization of microtubules
induced by 4 mm cacl2.29) our value is similar to theirs.
we used 4 mm cacl2, which is hardly a physiological
intracellular concentration of ca2+ , for depolymerization
because microtubules have been reported to lose their sensitivity for ca2+ as they are purified.43) hence a higher
concentration of ca2+ is needed to depolymerize purified
microtubules.
we have found that the microtubule-disrupting agents
tzt-1027 and vlb counteract the effect of a microtubule-stabilizing agent during polymerization. the molecular mechanism involved is unknown. however, our results
show that tzt-1027 and vlb not only inhibit microtubule polymerization, but also depolymerize polymerized
microtubules.13) ptx can polymerize already-polymerized
microtubules as well as pre-polymerized microtubules.30)
hence, the polymerization and depolymerization (evident
as an increase and decrease, respectively, in turbidity) can
be attributed to the change in polymerization or depolymerization at both ends of the microtubule and also to the
connecting or severing of intact microtubules. these two
kinds of agents have been reported to have both synergistic and antagonistic effects on cultured cells. the discrepancy seems to be dependent on the cells used, the order in
which the agents are applied, and the duration for which
the cells are in contact with these agents. we also examined combinations utilizing tzt-1027. however, at least
in the microtubule polymerization experiment, we did not
obtain synergistic results regardless of the order in which
the agents were applied.
it is of interest that the concentration at which depolymerization occurs in a cell-free system is far higher than

that at which cell proliferation is inhibited. tzt-1027
showed in vitro cytotoxicity at a concentration of about
several hundred pm (data not shown), while it inhibited
polymerization of microtubule proteins and purified tubulin at a concentration of several µm. thus, the concentration required to inhibit microtubule polymerization in a
cell-free system is about 10000-fold higher than that
required for inhibiting cell proliferation. the ability of
other antimicrotubule agents to inhibit cell proliferation
does not correlate well with their ability to interact with
microtubules in vitro.23, 44) as we have reported,13) a tubulin binder inhibits microtubule polymerization at substoichiometric concentrations, namely, one molecule of the
agent binds to one molecule of tubulin, resulting in inhibition of microtubule polymerization. the difference
between the levels of tubulin in cells and in a cell-free system could account for the discrepancy.
in conclusion, tzt-1027 possesses a unique chemical
structure and a broad spectrum of antitumor activity different from that of other clinically available agents. tzt1027 inhibits the polymerization of microtubule protein
and purified tubulin. the differences between tzt-1027
and vlb as they relate to tubulin are as follows; 1) tzt1027 has two binding sites, namely a high and a low affinity binding site, on tubulin, whereas vlb has only one, 2)
on tubulin, the binding sites for tzt-1027 and vlb are
not completely identical with each other, although tzt1027 can interact with vlb, 3) tzt-1027 has an inhibitory effect on the binding of gtp to tubulin, whereas vlb
does not, 4) in the polymerization of microtubule proteins,
vlb (and other vinca alkaloids) at high concentrations
show a decreased inhibitory effect, resulting in “aggregation,” whereas tzt-1027 does not, 5) in the polymerization of purified tubulin, vlb at high concentrations causes
so-called “aggregation” of purified tubulin, whereas tzt1027 does not. thus the binding profile of tzt-1027 is
different from that of vlb.
