summary
synopsis

 xxxd2155xxx , a selective  xxxg92xxx  agonist, produces effective doseproportional bronchodilation, which persists for up to 12 hours, in patients with
reversible obstructive respiratory disease. bronchodilation is significant within

minutes of inhalation, maximal within 2 hours, and at therapeutic doses is equivalent to that produced by standard doses of traditional beta2-agonists. in single-dose
studies comparing the two long-acting beta2-agonists  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol,
significant bronchodilation is achieved more rapidly with  xxxd2155xxx  than
salmeterol. duration of bronchodilation is similar with both drugs.
the therapeutic efficacy of inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  has been equal to or greater
than that of salbutamol (albuterol),  xxxd2098xxx  and terbutaline in both short and
long term clinical trials.  xxxd2155xxx  reduces symptoms of nocturnal asthma and
reduces the need for rescue medication compared with salbutamol. recent studies
have shown that the addition of inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  12 or 24mug twice daily to
existing inhaled corticosteroid regimens improves lung function and reduces
asthma symptoms compared with placebo. in one well designed study, the frequency of severe exacerbations of asthma over 12 months was decreased by
adding  xxxd2155xxx  to existing regimens of inhaled corticosteroids. tolerance to
the bronchodilator response of  xxxd2155xxx  has not been observed in long term
clinical trials.
because of its long duration of action,  xxxd2155xxx  offers significant therapeutic advantages over shorter-acting beta2-agonists in the treatment of nocturnal and
exercise-induced asthma.  xxxd2155xxx  is effective in preventing exercise-induced
asthma in adults and children and confers significantly more protection than
salbutamol when administered 3 and 12 hours before exercise.
in general, inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  is well tolerated. the most commonly reported
adverse effects, tremor and palpitations, are those traditionally associated with
the use of beta2-agonists. oral  xxxd2155xxx  and high doses of inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  are
associated with more adverse events than are the recommended doses of 6
to 24mug.
 xxxd2155xxx  is currently recommended for use as an alternative to increasing
inhaled steroid dosage in patients whose symptoms are inadequately controlled
despite therapy with low to moderate doses of inhaled steroids and intermittent
short-acting beta2-agonists, and results of recent studies support therapeutic guidelines. long term clinical studies comparing  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol have not
yet been published. further studies to evaluate the earlier use of  xxxd2155xxx  in
patients with mild to moderate asthma are needed to determine the role and long
term safety of  xxxd2155xxx  in the management of asthma.
pharmacodynamic
properties

the long-acting selective  xxxg92xxx  agonist  xxxd2155xxx  elicited doseproportional bronchodilation in patients with asthma as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 second (fev1), forced vital capacity (fvc), peak expiratory
flow (pef), and specific airways conductance (sgaw). as with salbutamol (albuterol), clinical effects of  xxxd2155xxx  were detected within 1 minute after inhalation; however, the duration of bronchodilation with  xxxd2155xxx  was
significantly longer than with salbutamol. the onset of action of  xxxd2155xxx  was
more rapid than that of salmeterol, but the duration of effect (≈12 hours) was
similar for both drugs.  xxxd2155xxx  usually produced maximum bronchodilation
within 2 hours of inhalation. dry powder capsule formulations of  xxxd2155xxx  have
been equipotent with  xxxd2155xxx  administered from a metered-dose inhaler
(mdi) in improving pulmonary function.  xxxd2155xxx  has exhibited some antiinflammatory effects in vitro.  xxxd2155xxx  inhibited allergen-induced responses in
animals and patients with asthma. in patients with moderate chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (copd), the onset and duration of action of  xxxd2155xxx  24mug

and salmeterol 50mug were similar. however, the effects of salmeterol persisted
longer than those of  xxxd2155xxx  in patients with severe copd.
oral  xxxd2155xxx  produced small dose-related increases in heart rate and decreases in blood pressure but cardiovascular effects were significant only after
high doses administered by inhalation. the cardiovascular effects of  xxxd2155xxx 
and salbutamol were similar, but less than those associated with  xxxd2098xxx . rebound bronchial hyperresponsiveness has not been seen after stopping treatment
with  xxxd2155xxx . attenuation of the bronchodilator response, with a concomitant
decrease in the density of beta2-receptors on peripheral blood lymphocytes, has been
noted after 2 or 4 weeks of  xxxd2155xxx  use.
pharmacokinetic
properties

 xxxd2155xxx  exhibited a biphasic serum concentration after single-dose inhalation
of 120mug, with an initial peak of 52 ng/l at 0.25 hours followed by a second peak
of 40 ng/l at 1.58 hours. the mean plasma half-life of  xxxd2155xxx  has been calculated as 3.4 hours after oral administration and 1.7 to 2.3 hours after inhalation.

therapeutic efficacy

the therapeutic efficacy of inhaled and oral  xxxd2155xxx  has been demonstrated in
both short and long term studies in patients with stable asthma or chronic obstructive airways disease. in studies that provided relevant baseline data, mean fev1
was usually 60 to 67% of predicted value. in noncomparative and placebocontrolled trials,  xxxd2155xxx  improved symptoms, produced clinically relevant
increases in pef and fev1, and reduced the need for rescue medication in patients
with asthma. improvements in lung function and control of asthma symptoms
with  xxxd2155xxx  were maintained during up to 5 years of treatment; there was no
evidence of a reduced bronchodilator response or worsening of asthma control.
long term studies showed no difference in lung function in patients using
 xxxd2155xxx  with or without concomitant anti-asthma therapy.
results of comparative trials showed inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  to be generally superior to salbutamol in improving lung function and asthma symptoms. in a representative study,  xxxd2155xxx  12mug twice daily was associated with a greater
decrease in diurnal variation in pre-bronchodilator pef (from 56 to 17 l/min)
than salbutamol 200mug 4 times daily (from 45 to 42 l/min); morning fev1 and
pef were higher with  xxxd2155xxx  than with salbutamol, even though salbutamol
recipients used more rescue medication. nocturnal asthma symptoms were better
controlled by  xxxd2155xxx  than by salbutamol. as with mdis, dry powder formulations of  xxxd2155xxx  were at least as effective as those of salbutamol.
 xxxd2155xxx  6 or 12mug twice daily via  xxxd379xxx ® (a multidose inspiratory
flow-driven dry powder inhalation device) was more effective than terbutaline
500mug 4 times daily at increasing morning and evening pef and reducing day
and night-time symptoms in studies involving more than 600 patients with stable
asthma.  xxxd2155xxx  and  xxxd2098xxx  similarly improved lung function, but
 xxxd2155xxx  was more efficacious in relieving nocturnal asthma. effects on lung
function of  xxxd2155xxx  and a combined regimen of  xxxd2098xxx  and ipratropium
bromide were similar, but the overall efficacy of  xxxd2155xxx  was considered to be
better.
a recent well designed double-blind study demonstrated that the addition of
inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  12mug twice daily to inhaled budesonide 100 or 400mug twice
daily reduced the frequency of severe exacerbation of asthma, improved pef and
symptom control and reduced the need for beta2-agonist rescue medication compared with placebo. similarly,  xxxd2155xxx  24mug twice daily was more effective
than placebo in improving morning pef and asthma symptom score and reducing

the need for rescue medication when added to existing therapy with inhaled
corticosteroids. initial results from a nonblind study indicate that the addition of
 xxxd2155xxx  12mug twice daily to inhaled beclomethasone 250mug twice daily resulted in a significantly greater increase in pef than doubling the dosage of the
inhaled corticosteroid.
in asthma patients receiving regular inhaled corticosteroid therapy, improvement in quality of life after 6 months was slightly greater after the addition of
 xxxd2155xxx  12mug twice daily via aerolizer® inhaler (a single-dose inspiratory
flow-driven dry powder inhalation device) compared with salmeterol 50mug twice
daily via diskhaler®, although this difference did not reach statistical significance.
a single dose of  xxxd2155xxx  12mug by inhalation provided significantly greater
protection against exercise-induced asthma (eia) than salbutamol 200 or 400mug
when administered 3 to 12 hours before exercise. postexercise fev 1 decreased
by 9% (median) at 3 hours compared with 17% after salbutamol and by 8 to 11%
when  xxxd2155xxx  was inhaled 12 hours before exercise. in children,  xxxd2155xxx 
12mug conferred about 75% protection against eia when inhaled 3 hours before
exercise, compared with the 46 and 17% protection provided by inhaled
salbutamol 400 and 200mug, respectively. similar results were obtained when dry
powder capsule formulations of  xxxd2155xxx  and salbutamol were compared in
patients with eia.
in patients with chronic obstructive airways disease,  xxxd2155xxx  was more
effective in increasing fev1 and improving symptoms than  xxxd2098xxx  and
salbutamol. these results need to be confirmed in long term studies.
when inhaled via  xxxd379xxx ® significant changes in lung function compared
with placebo were elicited by  xxxd2155xxx  6mug twice daily. however, in studies of
patients using other dry powder inhalation devices, the duration of action of
 xxxd2155xxx  6mug was less than that of  xxxd2155xxx  12 and 24mug.
tolerability

all formulations of  xxxd2155xxx  are well tolerated, with the fewest adverse events
associated with inhaled  xxxd2155xxx . the most commonly reported adverse effects
with inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  have been tremor and palpitation, traditionally associated
with the use of beta2-agonists. headache, muscle cramps, nausea and anxiety have
also been reported. in long term studies in adults, the incidence of adverse events
associated with inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  ranged from 0 to 11%. clinically significant
cardiac or metabolic effects were extremely rare. higher doses of inhaled
 xxxd2155xxx  (48mug) increased heart rate and tremor amplitude.
 xxxd2155xxx  has been as well tolerated as terbutaline and salbutamol in short
and long term comparative studies. elderly patients have tolerated  xxxd2155xxx  as
well as salbutamol, with no significant changes in electrocardiogram tracings,
heart rate, blood pressure, or laboratory values with either drug.

dosage and
administration

the current recommended use for  xxxd2155xxx  is as an alternative to increasing
inhaled corticosteroid dosage in patients in whom asthma symptoms are not adequately controlled with beclomethasone or budesonide 200 to 800mug daily or
fluticasone 100 to 400mug daily and as-required short-acting beta2-agonists. inhaled
 xxxd2155xxx  6 mug twice daily via  xxxd379xxx ®, or 12mug twice daily via aerolizer®,
other dry powder devices or mdi should initially be added to the above regimen,
and may be increased to 24mug twice daily if necessary. in europe,  xxxd2155xxx 
dosage is expressed as that delivered to the patient, 4.5 to 18mug twice daily, rather
than the metered dose of 6 to 24mug twice daily.  xxxd2155xxx  is intended as main-

tenance therapy and is not recommended as rescue treatment for severe exacerbations of asthma. patients should be advised not to discontinue steroids while
on  xxxd2155xxx  therapy, although dosage adjustments may be possible.

 xxxd2155xxx  is a beta2-selective adrenoceptor agonist that has a rapid onset of action and maintains
a bronchodilatory effect for up to 12 hours. like
other selective beta2-agonists,  xxxd2155xxx  has minimal stimulating effects on  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors and
virtually no effect on alpha-adrenoceptors. since publication of the previous review of  xxxd2155xxx  in
drugs,[1] well established guidelines for the use of
long-acting beta2-agonists in the management of
asthma have been published. data from singledose studies comparing  xxxd2155xxx  with another
long-acting beta2-agonist, salmeterol, are also available. in addition, new dry powder drug delivery
devices have been tested. this review updates earlier information, provides an overview of the pharmacological properties of  xxxd2155xxx  and further
clarifies the role of the drug in the management of
asthma.
1. pharmacological properties
1.1 effects on pulmonary function in
patients with asthma

dose-response studies have indicated that  xxxd2155xxx  produces dose-proportional bronchodilation.[1-3] inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  48mug increased the

peak effect for forced expiratory volume in 1 second (fev1) changes and the duration of effect
when compared with  xxxd2155xxx  12 and 24mug.
however, increases in fev1 were similar for  xxxd2155xxx  12 and 24mug.
the effect on pulmonary function of inhaled
 xxxd2155xxx  administered as dry powder capsules
has been comparable to that obtained with a pressurised metered dose inhaler (mdi).[4,5] in a recent, cumulative dose-response study in 12 patients, the bronchodilating effect of dry powder and
aerosol formulations of  xxxd2155xxx  [measured by
fev1 and peak expiratory flow (pef)] was similar.
the tolerability of the mdi formulation was better
than that of the dry powder capsules.[6]
1.1.1 comparisons with salbutamol

in studies reviewed earlier,[1] the effects on pulmonary function of oral or inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  compared favourably with those of salbutamol (albuterol), with a significantly longer duration of
action for  xxxd2155xxx  than salbutamol.[1] more recent data indicate that  xxxd2155xxx  12 and 24mug have
a similar bronchodilatory effect and are equivalent
to standard doses of salbutamol[7-9] in terms of
maximum effect (table i; table ii), but the duration

of effect of  xxxd2155xxx  is longer than that of
salbutamol.
the time between inhalation of  xxxd2155xxx  12
and 24mug via mdi or dry powder capsules and
significant bronchodilation is similar to that after
inhalation of salbutamol 200 or 400mug[7,8] and
shorter than with terbutaline 500mug.[10] one minute
after inhalation,  xxxd2155xxx  significantly increased
specific airway conductance (sgaw),[3,7,8] and produced peak dilation at 30 minutes; values after
 xxxd2155xxx  12 and 24mug were similar to those with
salbutamol 400mug during the first 30 minutes (table
i).[7] peak fev1 values are usually reached within
2 hours of inhalation of  xxxd2155xxx .[4,7,11] furthermore, the maximum increase in fev1 produced by
 xxxd2155xxx  is equal to or greater than that attained
with salbutamol 200mug.[1,8] studies of respiratory
impedance have shown that bronchodilation produced by  xxxd2155xxx  affects the central and peripheral airways as opposed to the markedly peripheral
effect of salbutamol.[12]
1.1.2 comparisons with salmeterol

several single-dose studies comparing the effects of  xxxd2155xxx  with salmeterol on lung function and bronchial reactivity in patients with
asthma have been published since 1991. in a recent
double-blind, randomised, crossover study, 30 pa© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

tients with stable, moderately severe asthma were
given single doses of salmeterol 50mug or  xxxd2155xxx  24mug via a mdi and spacer, and repeated
measurements of fev1, forced vital capacity
(fvc), airways resistance (raw) and sgaw were
made for up to 12 hours.  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol
had similar bronchodilatory effects that persisted
for at least 12 hours. the onset of action was significantly more rapid with  xxxd2155xxx  than with
salmeterol, and  xxxd2155xxx  achieved greater bronchodilation within the first 2 hours after administration than did salmeterol (table ii). similarly, in
a single-dose comparison of  xxxd2155xxx  6, 12 and
24mug via  xxxd379xxx ® (a multidose inspiratory
flow-driven dry powder inhalation device) with
salmeterol 50mug via diskhaler® (a dry powder inhalation device), the onset of action (time for fev1
to reach ≥15% above baseline) of  xxxd2155xxx  12
and 24mug was faster than that of salmeterol.[13] in
this study, it was estimated that a delivered dose of
between 4.5 and 9mug of  xxxd2155xxx  was as effective
as salmeterol 50mug. the area under the curve
(auc) for the change in fev1, fvc, sgaw and
raw from baseline was similar with  xxxd2155xxx 
50mug and salmeterol 200mug.[14]
in a comparison of  xxxd2155xxx  24mug and salmeterol 50mug in 16 patients with moderate chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), peak
bronchodilation was achieved at 4 hours with
 xxxd2155xxx  and at 5 hours with salmeterol.[15] in
these patients, the duration of effect of both drugs
was similar, but in another group of patients with
severe copd[16] the effects of salmeterol persisted
longer than those of  xxxd2155xxx . a dose-dependent
increase in bronchodilation was observed with  xxxd2155xxx  12, 24 and 36mug, but not with salmeterol
25, 50 and 75mug.[16] the discrepancy in results between the 2 studies was attributed to differences in
disease severity in the study populations.[16]
1.2 effects on allergic responses
1.2.1 studies in patients with asthma
comparisons with salbutamol

in adults and children, inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  12
and 24mug and salbutamol 200mug provided similar
drugs 1998 feb; 55 (2)

 xxxd2155xxx : an update

protection against  xxxd2586xxx -induced bronchoconstriction.[1,17] protection afforded by  xxxd2155xxx  12 or 24mug lasted for at least 12 hours,
whereas protection with salbutamol was no different from that in placebo recipients by 4 hours.[17]
in a study of 16 patients salbutamol 400mug and
 xxxd2155xxx  12 and 24mug produced similar bronchodilation after  xxxd2586xxx -induced bronchoconstriction. however, the onset of action of  xxxd2155xxx  12mug was slightly slower than that of the
other treatments.[18] the duration of protection
provided by  xxxd2155xxx  12mug against histamine
challenge[19] and by  xxxd2155xxx  24mug against cold
air sensitivity[20] was prolonged compared with
that provided by salbutamol 200mug.
both  xxxd2155xxx  30mug and salbutamol 500mug
completely inhibited the early asthmatic reaction
to allergen challenge in 12 patients with allergic
asthma. although both drugs significantly inhibited the late asthmatic reaction, the mean decrease
in pef was significantly less after treatment with
 xxxd2155xxx  than with salbutamol.[21]  xxxd2155xxx 
24mug and beclomethasone 200mug similarly reduced both the allergen-induced late asthmatic response and increase in airway responsiveness in 6
patients. neither drug affected the increases in
blood and sputum eosinophils and cd25+ lymphocytes associated with the inflammatory process.
 xxxd2155xxx , unlike beclomethasone, produced
bronchodilation in addition to preventing bronchoconstriction.[22]
comparisons with salmeterol

 xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol have performed similarly in studies comparing their bronchoprotective
effects. in a dose-finding study in 12 patients,
 xxxd2155xxx  12 and 24mug and salmeterol 50 and
100mug were equally effective in protecting against
 xxxd2586xxx -induced bronchoconstriction for up
to 24 hours.[23] similarly,  xxxd2155xxx  24mug and
salmeterol 50mug conferred comparable protection
for at least 16 hours in  xxxd2586xxx  provocation
tests in 15 patients.[24]

1.3 cardiovascular effects

oral  xxxd2155xxx  20 to 300mug produced doserelated increases in heart rate and decreases in
blood pressure in healthy volunteers.[1] the cardiovascular effects of repeated doses of inhaled
 xxxd2155xxx  24mug, salbutamol 400mug, and  xxxd2098xxx 
400mug have been studied recently in 12 healthy
volunteers. the inotropic, chronotropic, and electrophysiological effects of  xxxd2155xxx  were similar
to those of salbutamol and less than those of
 xxxd2098xxx . all 3 drugs significantly increased heart
rate and the corrected qt interval and decreased
total electromechanical systole and diastolic blood
pressure. although the mean maximum cardiovascular and metabolic effects of salbutamol and
 xxxd2155xxx  were similar, the cardiovascular effects
of  xxxd2155xxx  lasted longer.[25] in patients with
asthma who received single inhalations of  xxxd2155xxx  12, 24, 48, and 96mug as dry powder, significant increases in heart rate and qtc interval and
decreases in systolic blood pressure and electromechanical systole were noted only at high doses.[26]
1.4  xxxg92xxx  expression

in vitro studies have shown that salbutamol,
salmeterol and  xxxd2155xxx  reduce  xxxg92xxx 
density and  xxxg92xxx  mrna expression in
human lung tissue.[27] in 8 healthy volunteers, inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  72mug and salmeterol 300mug had
equivalent beta2-agonist effects at rest as indicated by
increased finger tremor and decreased serum potassium. in states of increased endogenous adrenergic tone and in the presence of  xxxd2098xxx  both
drugs exhibited beta2-receptor antagonism.[28]
newnham et al.[29] have shown attenuation of
the peak bronchodilator response and the duration
of bronchodilation in a 4-week placebo-controlled
study of  xxxd2155xxx  24mug twice daily from a mdi
in 7 patients. however, a significant bronchodilator response was still present at 6 hours after the
last dose. in accordance with the attenuated bronchodilator response, the density of beta2-receptors on
blood lymphocytes was significantly reduced as
was the maximal camp response to  xxxd2398xxx 
( xxxd2401xxx ). the same authors reported similar
drugs 1998 feb; 55 (2)

310

results in 16 patients treated with  xxxd2155xxx  24mug
twice daily from dry powder capsules.[30]
1.5 other effects

in healthy volunteers, repeated inhalation of
 xxxd2155xxx  24mug, salbutamol 400mug or  xxxd2098xxx 
400mug caused similar increases in plasma glucose
levels, whereas  xxxd2155xxx  and  xxxd2098xxx  had a
greater hypokalaemic effect than salbutamol.[25]
similar decreases in serum potassium levels have
been seen in patients with asthma given cumulative doses of  xxxd2155xxx  12 to 228mug or salbutamol 200 to 3800mug over 6 hours, although there
were no clinically important electrocardiographic
changes.[26,31] in most patients, however, serum potassium levels, although decreased, remained
within the normal range.[1,31] dose-related decreases in serum potassium levels occurred in patients with asthma who inhaled single doses of
 xxxd2155xxx  12, 24, 48 and 96mug, but only changes
after the highest dose were considered to be of possible clinical relevance.[26]
in vitro, treatment with  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol caused a rapid intracellular accumulation of
camp in a neuroblastoma cell line; intracellular
levels quickly decreased after the removal of
 xxxd2155xxx , but not salmeterol.[32] oral and inhaled
 xxxd2155xxx  significantly increased camp levels in
healthy volunteers.[1]
 xxxd2155xxx  is a significant ciliostimulant and
was 100 times more potent than terbutaline in increasing ciliary beat frequency in vitro and in vivo.
furthermore, the effect of  xxxd2155xxx  lasted twice
as long as that of terbutaline.[33] in patients with
chronic bronchitis,  xxxd2155xxx  significantly increased ciliary beat frequency and the mucociliary
clearance rate.[1,34]
1.6 mechanism of action

the exact mechanism by which  xxxd2155xxx  exerts prolonged effects on lung function in patients
with asthma is unknown. the prolonged duration
of action of  xxxd2155xxx  may be associated with its
interaction with membrane lipid bilayers (plasmalemma).[35] it is considered that the plasmalemma
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

bartow & brogden

lipid layer of airway smooth muscle acts as a depot
for beta2-agonists with moderate to high lipophilicity.
beta2-agonists, once having partitioned into the bilayer, remain available to interact with the beta2adrenoceptor.  xxxd2155xxx , which is moderately
lipophilic, enters the plasmalemma and is retained.
the drug is also able to reach the receptor from the
aqueous phase, accounting for its rapid onset of
action. subsequently, it gradually leaches out from
plasmalemma, continually activating the receptor,
imparting a prolonged bronchodilatory effect.[36]
a high concentration of  xxxd2155xxx  appears to
be necessary to achieve a long duration of action,
this may explain why oral  xxxd2155xxx  has a shorter
bronchodilator effect than the inhaled drug[35] and
differences in the effective dose of  xxxd2155xxx 
when administered via various delivery devices
(see section 3.3 and section 5).
2. overview of
pharmacokinetic properties
in the previous review of  xxxd2155xxx  in drugs,[1]
the urinary excretion rate and cumulative urinary
excretion were used to calculate an elimination
half-life for inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  of 1.7 to 2.3 hours.
following inhalation of  xxxd2155xxx  24mug, 24% of
the dose is excreted in the urine in 12 hours. after
oral (systemic)  xxxd2155xxx  40mug, urinary excretion
is 9.6% in 24 hours. after inhalation of  xxxd2155xxx 
12, 24, 48 and 96mug as dry powder, the change in
ratio of the rr and ss enantiomers in the urine
suggested that the inactive ss enantiomer preferentially reaches the systemic circulation after inhalation of the drug.[37]
in early studies, plasma concentrations were often below detectable limits after inhalation of therapeutic doses of  xxxd2155xxx . braat et al. [38] used
high performance liquid chromatography (hplc)
with electrochemical detection to measure plasma
concentrations during an 8-hour period after an
oral dose of  xxxd2155xxx  168mug. mean peak concentration (cmax) was 70.1 ng/l and half-life was 3.4
hours. cmax values of about 160 ng/l have been
previously reported after repeated oral doses of 40
to 80mug.[1]
drugs 1998 feb; 55 (2)

 xxxd2155xxx : an update

most pharmacokinetic data in the previous review were obtained from animal studies of oral
doses of  xxxd2155xxx .[1] recently, the pharmacokinetics of a single 120mug dose of inhaled  xxxd2155xxx 
were studied in healthy volunteers.[39] inhalation
of a single dose of  xxxd2155xxx  120mug appeared to
result in a biphasic pattern of kinetics in serum,
with an initial cmax of 52 ng/l occurring at 0.25
hours. following a lag period, a second cmax of 40
ng/l occurred at 1.58 hours.[39]
3. therapeutic efficacy
in early noncomparative and short term comparative trials,  xxxd2155xxx  was equal or superior to
conventional beta2-agonists in improving lung function and overall asthma control. since the previous
review,[1] several long term, placebo-controlled
and comparative trials in adults and children with
stable asthma have been conducted.
in most studies, lung function was objectively
assessed by measuring fev1, pef and fvc. in
studies that provided baseline spirometric data,
fev1 was generally 60 to 67% of predicted value.
in many studies, patients kept diaries of symptoms
and morning and evening measurements of pef. a
visual analogue scale (vas) was used to assess
breathing ability, sleep patterns, and general wellbeing. in most studies of exercise-induced asthma
(eia), a standard exercise test of ≥6 minutes of
treadmill running was performed from 3 to 12
hours after an inhaled dose.
3.1 stable bronchial asthma
3.1.1 short term studies

several early short term, noncomparative trials
demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of oral twice
daily  xxxd2155xxx  40 to 80mug in adults and 2 to 6
mug/kg in children, or inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  12mug
twice daily in children.[1] in a recent double-blind,
crossover trial, involving 43 patients with mild to
moderate asthma, the percentage of predicted
fev1 prior to the next dose in patients receiving
 xxxd2155xxx  12mug was superior to that achieved with
 xxxd2155xxx  6mug and placebo after 2 weeks of treatment.[40] administration of  xxxd2155xxx  6, 12 or
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

311

24mug twice daily via  xxxd379xxx ® to 156 patients
with asthma significantly decreased symptom
scores and supplementary medication requirements compared with placebo.[41]
3.1.2 long term studies

several recent studies, ranging in duration from
12 to 25 months, have demonstrated the long term
efficacy of  xxxd2155xxx  12 or 24mug twice daily (table
iii), confirming earlier results.[1] in 1 study, control
of asthma symptoms and improvements in lung
function were maintained without an increase in
inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  dosage or corticosteroid usage
for up to 60 months.[42] in this, as in an earlier
study,[43] there was no reduction in bronchodilator
response to  xxxd2155xxx  during 5 years of treatment.
 xxxd2155xxx  significantly reduced the need for systemic steroid intervention.[42] other noncomparative trials,[44-46] involving patients with moderately
severe to severe asthma, reported continued control of asthma symptoms with inhaled  xxxd2155xxx 
12 or 24mug twice daily over treatment periods of
12 to 20 months. similarly, in a 12-month trial of
 xxxd2155xxx  12 or 24mug twice daily in 280 patients,
the beneficial effects of the drug on pulmonary
function were maintained throughout the study.[47]
lack of evidence of desensitisation was reported
by maesen et al.[48] in 59 patients who had used
 xxxd2155xxx  12mug twice daily alone or concomitantly with other (unstated) anti-asthma drugs for
25 months.
most early trials of inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  in children with asthma were of short duration.[1] a recent 1-year noncomparative trial (available as an
abstract) evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of
 xxxd2155xxx  12 and 24mug twice daily inhaled as dry
powder capsules in 82 children. measures of lung
function (pef and fev1) and clinical efficacy
variables (daytime and night-time symptoms, rescue medication requirements and sleep disturbances) steadily improved over the course of the year
(table iii), without evidence of tachyphylaxis.[49]

equal to or greater than that of salbutamol.[1] these
results have been confirmed by more recent results[46,52-58] from comparative studies of  xxxd2155xxx  12 to 24mug twice daily and salbutamol 200 to
400mug 2 to 4 times daily inhaled as aerosol or dry
powder capsule formulations (table iv). patients
treated with inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  (via mdi) generally required less additional medication, experienced fewer asthma attacks and showed greater improvement in clinical parameters than patients
treated with inhaled salbutamol (via mdi). in one
crossover study,[53] a preference for  xxxd2155xxx  was
reinforced over a 1-year follow-up when 5 of 8
patients receiving salbutamol voluntarily changed
to  xxxd2155xxx . mean morning pef values were significantly higher in patients receiving  xxxd2155xxx 
(427 vs 372 l/min), even though salbutamol recipients used significantly more additional on-demand

medication (15.6 vs 7.6 puffs/week).[58] similarly,
midgren et al.[56] reported a 20% increase in morning mean pef compared with baseline in patients
treated with  xxxd2155xxx  24mug twice daily, whereas
mean pef did not increase in patients treated with
salbutamol 400mug twice daily. treatment with
 xxxd2155xxx  12mug twice daily was associated with a
significantly greater reduction in diurnal variation
in pre-bronchodilator pef (from 56 to 17 l/min)
than treatment with salbutamol (from 45 to 42
l/min). the numbers of episodes of asthma and the
number of sleep disturbances per week were significantly lower in patients treated with  xxxd2155xxx 
than in those receiving salbutamol.[54]
an 8-week crossover study in 25 children
(available as an abstract)[59] showed that changing
from salbutamol 200mug twice daily to  xxxd2155xxx 
24mug twice daily significantly improved pef.
drugs 1998 feb; 55 (2)

 xxxd2155xxx : an update

313

moreover, significant improvements in pef obtained in patients who were initially started on 4
weeks of therapy with  xxxd2155xxx  were maintained
when these patients switched to 4 weeks of therapy
with salbutamol.
 xxxd2155xxx  has also been reported to be more
effective than salbutamol in comparative studies of
dry powder capsule formulations[46,52,55] (table
iv). in a study of  xxxd2155xxx  12 or 24mug twice daily
versus salbutamol 400mug 4 times daily in 198 elderly patients,[52] both doses of  xxxd2155xxx  significantly increased morning pef compared with
salbutamol. in another recent large, double-blind,
randomised study of 318 patients,[55]  xxxd2155xxx  12
and 24mug twice daily improved night-time symptoms more than salbutamol 400mug 4 times a day.

the authors noted no advantage for  xxxd2155xxx 
24mug over  xxxd2155xxx  12mug. efficacy was maintained in 280 of these patients treated for an additional 12 months with  xxxd2155xxx  12mug.
terbutaline

overall efficacy of  xxxd2155xxx  12mug twice daily
has been rated as better than that of terbutaline 250
or 500mug 4 times daily in studies involving up to
150 patients.[1] furthermore,  xxxd2155xxx  has been
shown to relieve night-time symptoms more effectively than terbutaline.[60]
these findings have been confirmed in a recent
randomised, double-blind, parallel group study involving 291 evaluable patients treated with
 xxxd2155xxx  12mug twice daily or terbutaline 500mug

4 times daily via  xxxd379xxx ® for 12 weeks.  xxxd2155xxx  significantly improved morning and evening pef and reduced night-time symptoms when
compared with terbutaline pef and placebo. mean
morning pef increased by 18% with  xxxd2155xxx 
compared with a slight decrease with terbutaline.[61] furthermore, in a large double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of 397 patients,  xxxd2155xxx  6mug twice daily via  xxxd379xxx ®
significantly improved morning predrug pef by 20
l/min compared with a 9 l/min increase with terbutaline 500mug 4 times daily. daytime and nighttime asthma symptom scores also improved significantly more in patients receiving  xxxd2155xxx  than
in terbutaline recipients.[62]
other drugs

 xxxd2155xxx  has been compared with  xxxd2098xxx 
and with a combined regimen of  xxxd2098xxx  and ipratropium bromide.[1] although lung function improved similarly with  xxxd2155xxx  12mug twice or
 xxxd2098xxx  200mug 3 times daily,  xxxd2098xxx  was less
effective in treating nocturnal asthma symptoms.
overall efficacy of  xxxd2155xxx  was rated better than
that of  xxxd2098xxx . similarly, overall efficacy of
 xxxd2155xxx  was rated better than that of the combination of  xxxd2098xxx  and ipratropium bromide, even
though bronchodilation was similar in the 2
groups.
3.1.4 addition to existing
inhaled corticosteroid regimens

therapeutic guidelines (see section 6) recommend adding a long-acting beta2-agonist to low doses
of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with persistent symptoms or less than optimal lung function.
adding inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  24 to 48mug daily to existing regimens of inhaled corticosteroids has now
been shown to decrease the frequency of exacerbations of asthma,[63,64] the severity of asthma symptoms[63,64] and the need for short-acting beta2-agonists
for symptom relief,[63-65] and to improve pef.[63-65]
preliminary results suggest that the addition of
 xxxd2155xxx  to inhaled corticosteroids is at least as
effective in improving lung function and controlling asthma symptoms as doubling the dose of inhaled steroids.[65]
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

bartow & brogden

a recent double-blind, randomised, parallel
group trial conducted by the  xxxd2155xxx  and corticosteroid establishing therapy (facet) international study group[63] assessed the frequency of
exacerbations of asthma (primary outcome), severity of symptoms, the need for beta2-agonist rescue
medication and pef in 694 patients treated twice
daily with budesonide plus  xxxd2155xxx  via  xxxd379xxx ® or placebo. after a 4-week run-in period of
treatment with budesonide  xxxd379xxx ® 800mug
twice daily, patients received twice daily treatment
with budesonide 100mug plus placebo, budesonide
100mug plus  xxxd2155xxx  12mug, budesonide 400mug
plus placebo or budesonide 400mug plus  xxxd2155xxx 
12mug for 12 months. patients who initially received
daily doses of more than 2000mug of beclomethasone, 1600mug of budesonide by mdi, 800mug of
budesonide by  xxxd379xxx ®, or 800mug of fluticasone, were excluded from the study.
the rate of severe exacerbations (requiring
treatment with oral glucocorticoids, or a decrease
in pef to <30% below baseline value on 2 consecutive days) was reduced by 26% when  xxxd2155xxx 
was added to budesonide 100mug, by 49% when
budesonide was increased to 400mug and by 63%
when  xxxd2155xxx  was added to budesonide 400mug
(fig. 1). the reduction in the rate of severe exacerbations after increasing the dosage of budesonide
from 200 to 800mug daily was greater than that
achieved by adding  xxxd2155xxx  to the lower dose of
budesonide (p = 0.03), but these regimens were
similarly effective in reducing the rate of mild exacerbations (37 vs 40%). the addition of  xxxd2155xxx  to either dose of budesonide was associated
with a significant improvement in both daytime
and night-time symptom scores and reduced the
need for rescue medication. in comparison, increasing the dose of budesonide reduced the symptom score only during the day and the need for
rescue medication only at night. the increase in
pef was significant when  xxxd2155xxx  was added or
the dose of inhaled steroid increased, but tended to
be greater with the combined regimen.

of inhaled corticosteroids (100 to 3200 mug/day expressed as equivalent doses of different drugs)
were compared over a period of 6 months. inhaled
corticosteroid dosage was <800mug daily in 38.5%
of patients and >1600mug daily in 18.4% of patients.
treatment with  xxxd2155xxx  produced a significantly greater increase in morning pef (25.9 vs
–2.1 l/min) and a greater decrease in total asthma
symptom score and rescue medication requirements than placebo, which was independent of the
dose of inhaled corticosteroid. 33 patients treated
with  xxxd2155xxx  and 32 treated with placebo required one or more courses of oral prednisolone
(58 and 55 courses, respectively) to alleviate
exacerbations of asthma.[64]
a randomised, nonblind study compared the effects of adding  xxxd2155xxx  12mug twice daily to existing therapy with beclomethasone 250mug twice
daily or increasing the inhaled corticosteroid dosage to 500mug twice daily in 132 patients with
asthma.[65] the increase in mean morning pef and
the decreased use of rescue medication was significantly greater in patients given  xxxd2155xxx  than in
those whose inhaled steroid dosage was doubled
(treatment difference of 20.3 l/min).
quality of life (measured with the st george’s respiratory questionnaire) was significantly improved
in 482 asthma patients 3 and 6 months after the addition of  xxxd2155xxx  12mug twice daily via aerolizer®
inhaler (a single-dose dry powder capsule inhaler) or
salmeterol 50mug twice daily via diskhaler® to regular
inhaled corticosteroid therapy. the improvement was
slightly greater in  xxxd2155xxx  compared with
salmeterol recipients, although this difference did not
reach statistical significance.[66]
3.2 exercise-induced asthma

exercise is a frequent trigger for asthma exacerbation. in fact, eia may occur in up to 90% of
patients with asthma.[67]
as reported in the previous review,[1] a single
dose of  xxxd2155xxx  24mug provided prophylaxis
against eia when inhaled up to 8 hours before vigorous exercise.  xxxd2155xxx  24mug and  xxxd2098xxx 
400mug were equipotent in preventing eia when

given 15 minutes before exercise. although
 xxxd2155xxx  12mug and salbutamol 200mug were also
equally effective in preventing eia when administered 2 hours before exercise,  xxxd2155xxx  12mug provided significantly better protection than
salbutamol 200mug when given 4 hours before exercise.
more recent studies have extended these findings to show that a single dose of  xxxd2155xxx  12mug
provides protection against eia for up to 12 hours.
several double-blind, placebo-controlled studies
have compared the efficacy of  xxxd2155xxx  12 to
24mug with that of salbutamol 200 to 400mug in patients with eia (table v).
in all studies, the efficacy of  xxxd2155xxx  in preventing eia was greater than or equal to that of
salbutamol when administered at 3, 8, and 12 hours
before exercise. daugbjerg et al.[68] showed that
 xxxd2155xxx  12mug via aerolizer® inhaler[51] resulted
in a significantly smaller median percentage decrease in fev1 than salbutamol at both 3 and 12
hours (fig. 2). three hours after inhalation, the me© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

dian percentage decrease in fev1 after ≥6 minutes
of treadmill exercise was 9% for  xxxd2155xxx  compared with 17% for salbutamol. when  xxxd2155xxx 
was administered 12 hours before exercise, the median percentage fall in fev1 ranged from 8% to 11%.
percentage protection against eia (percentage
reduction in fev1 with placebo minus percentage
decrease in fev1 with treatment, divided by the
decrease with placebo × 100), an indicator of the
clinical importance of a statistically significant effect, was calculated in 2 recent studies in children.[68,69] protection of 50% has been established
as clinically important. three hours after inhalation,  xxxd2155xxx  conferred 76 to 77% protection
compared with 46% with salbutamol 400mug and
17% with salbutamol 200mug. at 12 hours, the extent of protection was 70% with  xxxd2155xxx  12mug
and 13% with salbutamol 400mug.[68] all differences
between the 2 drugs were statistically significant.
similar results were obtained whether the drugs
were inhaled as dry powder capsules[68,71] or aerosol.[67,69,70]

3.3 delivery devices

median decrease in fev1 (%)

it is known that delivery devices have different
deposition characteristics.[72]  xxxd2155xxx  has traditionally been delivered via a propellant-driven
pressurised mdi. with optimal inhalation technique, these devices deliver only about 10 to 15%
of the metered dose to the airways, whereas dry
powder inhalers such as  xxxd379xxx ® and aerolizer® deliver 20 to 35% of the metered dose.[51,72]
dry powder inhalers eliminate most of the problems associated with difficulty in coordinating actuation of an mdi with inhalation. however, total
drug dose delivered with dry powder inhalers appears to be sensitive to patient inspiratory flow
rate.[51,73]
the therapeutic efficacy of other delivery
systems for  xxxd2155xxx  has also been studied.[61,62,72,74-76] in a multicentre, randomised,
double-blind, parallel group study, involving 194
patients with mild to moderate asthma,  xxxd2155xxx 
6, 12 and 24mug twice daily via  xxxd379xxx ® was
more effective than placebo in improving morning
(increase of 40 vs 9 l/min) and evening (increase
of 35 vs 3 l/min) pef, reducing asthma symptoms and decreasing rescue medication requirements.[74] in this study, the lowest dose to control
clinical symptoms effectively and improve lung

 xxxd2155xxx  6mug twice daily via  xxxd379xxx ® has
been confirmed in a comparison with terbutaline
administered by the same device (section 3.1.3).
studies that assessed the efficacy of  xxxd2155xxx  administered via  xxxd379xxx ® when added to existing
inhaled corticosteroid regimens are discussed in
section 3.1.4.
another new multiple-dose, dry powder inhalation device has been tested recently in 18 patients.[4] patients received placebo or  xxxd2155xxx  6,
12 or 24mug twice daily for 4 treatment periods of 8
days each. all doses of  xxxd2155xxx  elicited significant increases in fev1 between 1 and 12 hours in
comparison with placebo. the effectiveness of
 xxxd2155xxx  24mug (as measured by fev1) was significantly superior to that of  xxxd2155xxx  12 and
6mug. the efficacy of  xxxd2155xxx  6mug with this device seemed to wane at 8 hours, and the efficacy of
all doses decreased between 12 and 24 hours after
inhalation.

reported with inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  are those traditionally associated with the use of beta2-agonists. in
general, the most common adverse events reported
are tremor, palpitation, headache and muscle
cramps.[1,53,56] in adults, the incidence of adverse
events with inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  has ranged from 0%
to 11% in large, long term studies of 9 to 20 months
duration.[44,46] clinically insignificant electrocardiogram (ecg) changes were reported in 3 of 116
(2.6%) patients treated with inhaled  xxxd2155xxx 
12mug twice daily;[46] a clinically significant ecg
abnormality that was possibly related to treatment
with  xxxd2155xxx  12mug twice daily has been reported
in only 1 patient.[45] in clinical studies, significant
cardiovascular effects have not been reported in
patients treated with therapeutic doses of  xxxd2155xxx . changes in heart rate and blood pressure have
been minimal, probably as a result of the marked
beta2-selectivity of  xxxd2155xxx  and have not been considered clinically significant.[1]
in comparative trials with terbutaline and
salbutamol,  xxxd2155xxx  was as well tolerated as the
comparator drug.[54,58,61] tremor was reported in
6% of patients treated with  xxxd2155xxx  versus 2%
of patients treated with salbutamol, but the difference was not significant.[58] tolerability in elderly
patients (n = 198; mean age 71 years) has been
studied in a recent trial comparing  xxxd2155xxx  and
salbutamol. both drugs were equally well tolerated. no significant changes in laboratory values,
heart rate, blood pressure, or ecg tracings were
noted.[52]
adverse events occurred in 26% of 82 asthmatic
children who received  xxxd2155xxx  12 and 24mug inhaled as dry powder capsules twice daily for 1 year.
most of the adverse events related to the respiratory tract.[49] children tolerated the syrup formulation well, although 1 child had a single episode of
severe tremor that was alleviated by terminating
treatment.[1]
in a single-dose study comparing the tolerability
of  xxxd2155xxx  12, 24 and 48mug dry powder capsules
with that of  xxxd2155xxx  12mug via a mdi, and placebo, maesen et al.[2] reported that there were no
significant differences in heart rate when  xxxd2155xxx  12mug was administered via either device.

bartow & brogden

 xxxd2155xxx  48mug significantly increased heart rate
compared with all other doses, although the increase (3 beats per minute) was not clinically significant. in another single-dose study,[77] tremor response to  xxxd2155xxx  12 and 24mug was compared
when both doses were inhaled as either solution or
suspension aerosol. the higher dose of each formulation produced increased tremor amplitude compared with the lower dose and the tremor response
to suspension aerosol was higher than that to solution aerosol. these results[2,77] support a dosedependent effect on adverse events, although not
all studies have confirmed this effect.[46]
5. dosage and administration
the current recommended dosage of inhaled
 xxxd2155xxx  for adults and children 6 years and older
is 6mug twice daily via  xxxd379xxx ®, or 12mug (1 puff)
twice daily via aerolizer® or other dry powder devices, or mdi. if the recommended dosage does not
sufficiently control symptoms, it may be increased
to 24mug twice daily and subsequently be titrated
according to effect. dosage should be individualised.
in europe, dose may be expressed as that delivered to the patient, 4.5 to 18mug, rather than the metered dose of 6 to 24mug.
the recommended dosage of oral  xxxd2155xxx  is
80mug 2 or 3 times daily in adults and 1.5 mug/kg 2
or 3 times daily in children. dry syrup, at a dosage
of 4 mug/kg/day in 2 to 3 divided doses, is recommended for children.[1] dosage recommendations
for parenteral  xxxd2155xxx  are not available.
 xxxd2155xxx  should be administered in conjunction with regular doses of inhaled or oral corticosteroids.[78-81] the current recommendations for
the use of  xxxd2155xxx  are as an alternative to increased dosages of inhaled corticosteroids in
patients who remain symptomatic while receiving low to moderate doses of inhaled corticosteroids.[82,83]
 xxxd2155xxx  is a long-acting beta2-agonist currently
recommended for maintenance therapy and should
not be used to treat acute exacerbations of asthma.

 xxxd2155xxx : an update

review in drugs.[1] patients should be warned not
to discontinue therapy with corticosteroids while
on  xxxd2155xxx , although adjustment of corticosteroid dosage may be possible. as with any bronchodilator, reduced efficacy of  xxxd2155xxx  may indicate a worsening of asthma.
6. place of  xxxd2155xxx  in the
management of asthma
since the recognition of the importance of inflammation in asthma, guidelines[81-86] have recommended the regular use of anti-inflammatory
drugs as first-line maintenance therapy in patients
in whom asthma symptoms are not controlled by
occasional use of short-acting beta2-agonists. because of a possible link between asthma death and
high doses of short-acting beta2-agonists, current guidelines recommend that short-acting beta2-agonists
should be used only intermittently for symptom
relief.
since the last review in drugs, the role of an
inhaled long-acting selective beta2-agonist in the
management of asthma has been further clarified.
the principles of pharmacological management of
chronic asthma as stipulated in the uk and us
guidelines are based on an approach comprising 4
or 5 steps. patients start treatment at the step most
appropriate to the initial severity of their asthma.
the number of drugs and dosage are increased as
the disease becomes more severe. based on the assessment of new scientific evidence it is recommended that long-acting beta2-agonists be used an alternative to increasing the dosage of inhaled
corticosteroids in patients whose asthma symptoms are poorly controlled with a regular regimen
of low to moderate doses of inhaled corticosteroids
and short-acting beta2-agonists as needed.[82,83] although in vitro studies suggest that  xxxd2155xxx  may
have some anti-inflammatory properties, clinically
relevant effects on chronic airway inflammation
have not been demonstrated; therefore,  xxxd2155xxx 
should be used in conjunction with an anti-inflammatory agent.

with asthma. in clinical studies, the efficacy and
tolerability of  xxxd2155xxx  have compared favourably with those of shorter-acting beta2-agonists such as
salbutamol, terbutaline and  xxxd2098xxx . furthermore, patients have preferred  xxxd2155xxx  over alternative bronchodilators. in addition,  xxxd2155xxx 
has been more effective than comparators in preventing eia and in the prophylaxis of nocturnal
asthma. in single-dose studies, the onset of action
of  xxxd2155xxx  has been more rapid than that of
salmeterol, another long-acting selective beta2-agonist, and roughly equal to that of salbutamol. the
duration of action has been similar for  xxxd2155xxx 
and salmeterol.
earlier guidelines for the management of
chronic asthma in adults recommended increasing
inhaled steroid dosage before adding a long-acting
beta2-agonist. however, new guidelines from the
uk[82] and us[83] suggest adding a long-acting beta2agonist as an alternative option to increasing steroid dosage in patients with persistent asthma
symptoms despite treatment with low to moderate
doses of inhaled corticosteroids, especially in patients with nocturnal asthma symptoms or sensitivity to exercise. results of a double-blind study
which investigated the efficacy of adding  xxxd2155xxx  12mug twice daily via  xxxd379xxx ® to low (200
mug/day) and moderate dose (800 mug/day) budesonide indicated that the addition of the long-acting
beta2-agonist significantly reduced the frequency of
severe asthma exacerbations compared with placebo.[63] preliminary results also indicate that adding  xxxd2155xxx  to inhaled  xxxd294xxx  500mug daily improved lung function, more
than doubling the dosage of the inhaled steroid.[65]
similarly, studies with salmeterol have shown that
the addition of the long-acting beta2-agonist to low
(400 mug/day)[87] or moderate (1000 mug/day)[88]
dosages of  xxxd294xxx  improved
lung function and controlled symptoms better than
increasing the dosage of inhaled steroids. these
results support the therapeutic guidelines that recommend adding a long-acting beta2-agonist to low
doses of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with
persistent symptoms or less than optimal lung
function.  xxxd2155xxx  may be especially helpful in
drugs 1998 feb; 55 (2)

bartow & brogden

persistent symptoms or less than optimal lung
function.  xxxd2155xxx  may be especially helpful in
patients with nocturnal asthma or eia. it has been
suggested that combined therapy with inhaled steroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist may be more
effective than steroids alone because of the complementary action of the two drugs.[89]
the precise role of  xxxd2155xxx  in the management of acute asthma remains to be clarified. although its onset of action is similar to salbutamol,
 xxxd2155xxx  is not recommended for use as rescue
medication in acute asthma. because of its long
duration of action,  xxxd2155xxx  may mask signs that
more aggressive therapy is warranted. however,
the use of  xxxd2155xxx  in the acute setting has not
been evaluated.
in conclusion,  xxxd2155xxx  twice daily is generally more effective than and as well tolerated as
shorter-acting beta2-agonists in treating patients with
asthma. in single-dose studies,  xxxd2155xxx  and
salmeterol have similar bronchodilatory effects
and are equally prolonged in their action, but
 xxxd2155xxx  has a more rapid onset of action than
salmeterol. clinical studies comparing the two
long-acting agents in the long term treatment of
asthma have yet to be published.
 xxxd2155xxx  is currently recommended for use in
symptomatic patients taking low to moderate doses
of inhaled steroids as an alternative to increasing
corticosteroid dosage. further appropriately designed studies comparing these two alternative
treatment regimens and analyses to define features
predictive of individual patient responses are
needed. patients with mild to moderate asthma who
have eia or nocturnal asthma symptoms may particularly benefit from the long duration of action of
 xxxd2155xxx . studies of longer duration and evaluating the earlier use of  xxxd2155xxx  in patients with
mild to moderate asthma will further clarify its
safety and optimum role in the management of
asthma.
