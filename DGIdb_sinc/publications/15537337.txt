abstract: some piperidine-based nocaine/modafinil hybrid
ligands have been designed, synthesized, and found to display
an improved potency at all three monoamine transporters and
particularly for dat and/or net. some highly active and
selective  xxxg2099xxx  inhibitors with low nanomolar to subnanomolar potency were identified. ligands of this
type may find important applications as positron emission
tomography imaging tools and in the treatment of central
nervous system disorders such as depression and sleep apnea.

in the central nervous system (cns), monoamines
such as dopamine (da), serotonin (5-ht), and norepinephrine (ne) have an important modulatory role in
neurotransmission and are intimately involved in a
variety of physiological functions and pathological conditions.1,2 selective  xxxg2099xxx  (dat, sert,
or net) inhibitors (e.g., gbr 12909,  xxxd2546xxx , fluoxetine, paroxetine,  xxxd3089xxx ,  xxxd160xxx , desipramine,
imipramine, bupropion, and nisoxetine) have been
developed to treat a number of psychological and
neurological disorders such as depression, drug abuse,

attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd), anxiety,
mood problems, parkinson’s disease, alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, chronic pain,
migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke, trauma,
mania, obesity, and narcolepsy.3-8 however, important
issues regarding the selectivity and mechanisms of
action of these drugs remain unresolved. research with
novel ligands that vary in their selectivity profiles and
potency at each of these three transporter sites may be
of value to unraveling the relevant pharmacological
mechanisms and thus aid in the discovery of new
medications with fewer side effects.
previously, we reported on the synthesis and pharmacology of some 3,4-substituted piperidine-based cocaine analogues.9 after extensive in vitro studies,
together with assays of locomotor activity, and selfadministration and drug discrimination studies, the
dat/net selective ligand (+)-methyl 4beta-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-methylpiperidine-3r-carboxylate [(+)-cpca,
1, nocaine] was chosen for advancement to human
clinical studies for the treatment of cocaine addiction10,11
nocaine has lower potency and efficacy compared with
cocaine in increasing locomotor activity in rodents and
produces partial methamphetamine-like discriminative
stimulus effects, although it is fully cocaine-like in
cocaine-trained animals. moreover, it shows reduced
reinforcing effects in nonhuman primates. nocaine dosedependently antagonizes cocaine-induced locomotor activation and potentiates the discriminative stimulus
effects of a low dose of cocaine. on the other hand,
modafinil (provigil) 2, a non-amphetamine-like wakepromoting agent, has been approved recently for the
treatment of narcolepsy. however, modafinil has been
linked to side effects that include nausea, infection,
nervousness, anxiety, and insomnia. it shows a low but
selective affinity to the dat in canine brain membranes.12 modafinil’s mode of action is complex and still
uncertain, although studies suggest that it increases
wakefulness by activating r-1 noradrenergic transmission13 or hypothalamic cells that contain the peptide
hypocretin14 or that it may work by modulating gabaergic tone.15 other research suggests that the presynaptic

activation of da transmission is a key pharmacological
event in mediating the wake-promoting effects of currently available cns stimulants and that it is critical
for the pharmacological control of wakefulness, while
activation of the ne system is critical for rapid eye
movement sleep regulation.16 experiments using dat
knock-out mice appear to support an important role for
the dat in sleep regulation and thus in the wakepromoting action of modafinil.17
since valuable therapies have emerged from compounds exhibiting varying levels of transporter selectivity, we sought to examine the effect of creating hybrid
molecules combining structural features of nocaine and
modafinil. specifically, we decided to explore the effect
of replacement of the hydrolyzable ester function of
nocaine with the same type of sulfur-containing side
chain as found in modafinil. this alteration to one of
the key pharmacophore elements of nocaine was anticipated to further reduce its reinforcing properties while
possibly improving its half-life (chart 1).
our synthetic approach to these hybrid structures
starting from arecoline9 is outlined in schemes 1 and
2. the requisite steps are quite straightforward and
based in part on the methods devised for the synthesis
of nocaine itself. in the course of oxidation of the sulfide
intermediates to the corresponding sulfoxides, an additional chiral center is created at the sulfur atom.
typically, two diastereoisomers are generated in a ratio
of approximately 1:1, which is readily observable by

was attempted but was unsuccessful. however, in light
of the fact that the sulfoxides have substantially lower
activity compared with the sulfides (see table 1) and
that the commercial drug modafinil itself is used in
racemic form, further efforts to bring about the preferential formation of one stereoisomer over the other by
optimizing the oxidation conditions using selective
oxidizing agents have not been made.
the newly synthesized ligands were evaluated for the
ability to inhibit high affinity uptake of da, 5-ht, and
ne using rat synaptosomal nerve endings.6a from the

uptake inhibition data (table 1), it is surmised that the
replacement of the hydrolyzable ester function of nocaine
with the sulfur appendage found in modafinil leads in
general to a substantial enhancement in dat/net
inhibitory potency for many of the ligands. in addition,
some of the ligands display unique levels of transporter
selectivity and potency.
the conversion of the carboxylic ester of nocaine into
the intermediate alcohol 4 and iodide 5 improves
activity at the sert without causing any significant
alteration in potency at the dat or net. however, the
introduction of the sulfur appendage into nocaine
significantly enhances the inhibitory activity at the dat
and net. thus, the key intermediate 6, a hybrid ligand,
displays fairly good activity at the net (ki ) 25 nm)
and at the dat (ki ) 80 nm) while at the same time
exhibiting moderate activity at the sert (ki ) 208 nm).
the oxidation of sulfide 6 to sulfoxide 7 leads to a
reduced transporter activity. alcohol 8 exhibits a remarkable potency at the net (ki ) 0.94 nm) and at
the dat (ki ) 16 nm) as well as a 170-fold and 10-fold
selectivity vs the sert, respectively. the corresponding
alcohol 9 containing a sulfoxide function has a lower
potency (ki ) 42 nm) at the net and a 50-fold
selectivity vs the sert, but it displays a higher potency
(ki ) 12 nm) at the dat and a 180-fold selectivity vs
the sert. in comparison to alcohol 8, the methyl ether
analogues 10 and 11 exhibit a lower but still fairly good
dat/net activity. among the inverse acyl and benzoyl
esters, ligands 12, 13, and 15 are good dat/net
inhibitors while ligand 14 is interestingly a good sert
and net inhibitor with potencies of 6.7 and 4.5 nm,
respectively. among the amide analogues, ligands 16a-d
display a similar and fairly potent net activity while
16c is also a good dat inhibitor. interestingly, ligand
16e exhibits outstanding activity with approximately
1 nm potency at all three monoamine transporters.
ligand 16f is an outstanding sert and net inhibitor
with potencies of 4.5 and 0.68 nm, respectively. in
comparison to the sulfide ligands 16a-f, the corresponding sulfoxide-amide analogues 17a-f generally
display a reduced activity except compound 17b, which
exhibits a slightly improved potency at the net (ki )
12 nm) and the dat (ki ) 55 nm) and a much better
selectivity vs the sert (ki ) 1795 nm). while oxadiazole analogues are of interest because of their anticipated prolonged action and high metabolic stability,
ligands 18 and 19 display only a moderate to low
activity at the net. interestingly, the n-demethylated
ligands 20-22 exhibit a remarkable activity at the net
with ki down to 0.56 nm (20), a result that likely reflects
the change from a tertiary to a secondary amine.
in regard to their druglike properties, many of these
ligands have clogp values (see the supporting information) in the range deemed suitable for penetration of
the blood-brain barrier, as per lipinski’s “rule of five”.19
on the basis of results in hand, we intend to focus on
ligands displaying improved net activity with ki values
less than 1 nm. specifically, given the fact that ligands
8 and 16f exhibit remarkable net inhibitory activity
(ki values for net are 0.94 and 0.68 nm, respectively)
while also exhibiting suitable lipophilicity (clogp in the
range of 2-4), we believe that they may be good netselective ligands primed for c-11 labeling for advance-

figure 1. effect of cocaine and ligand 8 (jz-iii-84) on
horizontal locomotor activity. following a 30 min habituation
period, saline (0.9%), cocaine, and ligand 8 were injected ip (1
cm3/kg) in the doses indicated and total locomotor activity was
automatically recorded for 90 min as infrared beam breaks in
a 16 in. × 16 in. photobeam activity system (san diego
instruments). cocaine and ligand 8 significantly increased
total activity counts as indicated by one-way analysis of
variance (f4,14 ) 28.4, p < 0.001). the asterisk (/) indicates
that the individual treatment group is significantly different
from saline control (p < 0.05, tukey’s post hoc test).

ment to the small-molecule-directed brain imaging and
therapy program. to assess the bioavailability and
initial cocaine-like behavioral activity of 8, we compared
two doses of cocaine and 8 in an open-field locomotor
activity study (figure 1). ligand 8 was more potent than
cocaine and appeared to be somewhat more efficacious
as well. although much more extensive testing is needed
to fully characterize the behavioral effects of 8, these
differences are consistent with its 17-fold net vs dat
selectivity and its virtual lack of activity at sert.20
further behavioral testing of some of the ligands in this
series is currently underway.
in summary, some piperidine-based nocaine/modafinil
hybrid ligands have been synthesized and found to
display an improved potency at all three monoamine
transporters but particularly for dat and/or net. some
highly active and selective  xxxg2099xxx 
inhibitors with low nanomolar to subnanomolar potency
were identified including 8 and 20 (net), 9, 11, 13, 15,
16c, and 17b (dat/net), 14 and 16f (sert/net), and
16e (dat/sert/net). because many of these ligands
have clogp values in the range deemed suitable for
penetration of the blood-brain barrier, they can be
examined for their in vivo actions and radiolabeled as
possible positron emission tomography (pet) imaging
tools. the potency and selectivity profiles of these hybrid
molecules may allow us to gain a better understanding
of the relation between transporter activity and biological effect. this knowledge may allow for an improved
design of cns therapeutics.
