abstract: purpose: we investigated the effects of pegylated ifn-a2b (pegifn-a2b) on the growth of human liver cancer cells. methods: the effect of
peg-ifn-a2b on the proliferation of 13 liver cancer cell lines was
investigated in vitro. chronological changes in growth and ifn-a receptor-2
( xxxg1138xxx -2) expression were monitored in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc)
cells (hak-1b) cultured with peg-ifn-a2b. after hak-1b cells were
transplanted into nude mice, various doses of peg-ifn-a2b or ifn-a2b
were administered, and tumor volume, weight, histology, and  xxxg1138xxx -2
expression were examined. results: peg-ifn-a2b inhibited the growth of
nine cell lines with apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
continuous contact with peg-ifn-a2b induced time-dependent growth
inhibition and down-regulation of  xxxg1138xxx -2 expression. peg-ifn-a2b
induced a dose-dependent decrease in tumor volume and weight, a signiﬁcant
increase of apoptotic cells, and a decrease in  xxxg1138xxx -2 expression in the
tumor. the clinical dose for chronic hepatitis c was also effective. the
antitumor effect of peg-ifn-a2b was signiﬁcantly stronger than that of
non-peg-ifn-a2b in vivo. conclusions: continuous contact with peg-ifna2b induces strong antitumor effects and the down-regulation of  xxxg1138xxx -2 in
hcc cells. the data suggest potential clinical application of peg-ifn-a2b
for the prevention and treatment of hcc.

interferon-a (ifn-a) is a multifunctional cytokine that possesses antiviral activity, antiproliferative activity, various immunoregulatory
activities, antitelomerase activity, and antiangiogenesis activity (1–3). the antiviral activity of
ifn-a has attracted much attention, and ifn-a
preparations have been used in the treatment of
hepatitis b virus- and hepatitis c virus (hcv)related chronic hepatitis in many countries (4).
recently, ifn-a has been shown to possess
highly suppressive effects on hepatocellular carcinogenesis and the recurrence of hepatocellular
carcinoma (hcc) after curative treatment for
hcc in patients with virus-related chronic hepatitis (5–10). however, the mechanisms of these
actions have not yet been clariﬁed. we previously
reported that human lymphoblastoid ifn-a de964

rived from sendai virus-induced ball-1 cells
(ball-1 ifn-a) directly suppressed the cell
proliferation of 13 liver cancer cell lines to various
degrees by inhibiting cell cycle progression with
or without apoptosis in vitro (11). recently, we
also showed that consensus ifn-a at or close to
the clinical dose used in treatment for hcvrelated chronic hepatitis suppressed hcc growth
in nude mice (12). this suggests that the direct
antiproliferative action of ifn-a may be involved
in the suppressive mechanisms of ifn-a on
hepatocellular carcinogenesis. in clinical practice,
ifn-a alone or in combination with other anticancer drugs such as 5-ﬂuorouracil has been used
in the treatment of malignant diseases including
leukemia, renal cancer (4, 13) and advanced hcc
(14).

growth inhibition of hepatoma cells by peg-ifn-a2b
pegylated ifn a-2b (peg-ifn-a2b) is a covalent conjugate of recombinant ifn-a2b with a
monomethoxy  xxxd2982xxx  (peg) in a 1:1
molar ratio that produces a 31 000-da molecule
(15). peg conjugation increases the size of the
molecule. therefore, the absorption of the pegylated molecule is slower, its serum half-life is
longer, and its rate of clearance from the plasma
is lower than that of the unmodiﬁed molecule.
peg-ifn-a2b thereby increases patient exposure
to ifn-a2b and requires less frequent administration (15). clinical trials in patients with
chronic hepatitis c suggest that peg-ifn-a preparations produce more potent therapeutic effects with or without ribavirin than do non-pegifn-a preparations (15–20). however, whether
or not peg-ifn preparations are superior to
non-peg-ifn preparations in terms of suppressive effects on hepatocellular carcinogenesis and
hcc growth has not been clariﬁed. in addition,
there have been no basic in vitro or in vivo studies
that evaluate the efﬁcacy of peg-ifn-a2b on
hcc cells. in the current study, we examined the
in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects of peg- and
non-peg-ifn-a2b on liver cancer cell lines by
using several peg-ifn-a2b concentrations including a low dose that is close to the clinical
dose. we also examined the expression of type i
ifn receptor 2 ( xxxg1138xxx -2) subunit and its relationship with antitumor effects on hcc cells
under the condition of continuous contact with
peg-ifn-a2b.

materials and methods

cell lines and cell culture

this study used 11 hcc cell lines (kim-1, kyn1, kyn-2, kyn-3, hak-1a, hak-1b, hak-2,
hak-3, hak-4, hak-5, and hak-6) and two
human combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma (chc) cell lines (kmch-1 and
kmch-2). these hcc and chc cell lines were
originally established in our laboratory, and each
cell line retains the morphological and functional
features of the original tumor as described elsewhere (11, 21–29).
the cells were grown in dulbecco’s modiﬁed
eagle medium (nissui seiyaku co., tokyo,
japan) supplemented with 2.5% heat-inactivated
(56 1c, 30 min) fetal bovine serum (fbs, bioserum, vic, australia), 100 u/ml penicillin,
100 mg/ml streptomycin (gibco brl/life technologies inc., gaithersburg, md) and 12 mmol/l
sodium bicarbonate, in a humidiﬁed atmosphere
of 5% co2 in air at 37 1c.

ifn and reagents

peg-ifn-a2b (peg introns) and ifn-a2b (intronsa) were kindly provided by scheringplough k.k. (osaka, japan). the speciﬁc activity
of peg-ifn-a2b was 6.4  107 iu/mg protein
and that of ifn-a2b was 2.6  108 iu/mg
protein.
anti-bromodeoxyuridine (brdu) antibody and
ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat antimouse immunoglobulin (fitc-gam) were
purchased from bd biosciences (san jose, ca);
control normal mouse igg1, from dako
(glostrup, denmark); rat antibody against
mouse endothelial cells (anti-cd34, clone
mec14.7), from serotec co., oxford, uk;
mouse monoclonal antibody against human asmooth muscle actin (sma) that cross-reacts
with mouse a-sma (clone 1a4), from immunon
(pittsburgh, pa); rabbit antibody against vimentin fragment (v1) (caspase-9 activation state antibody (30)), from medical & biological
laboratories co. ltd. (nagoya, japan); mouse
monoclonal antibody against human ifn a/b
receptor chain 2, from chemicon international
inc. (temecula, ca); and mouse monoclonal
antibody against human  xxxg681xxx 
(egf) receptor, from upstate biotechnology
incorporated (lake placid, ny).
effects of peg-ifn-a2b and ifn-a2b on the proliferation
of hcc and chc cell lines in vitro

the effects of peg-ifn-a2b on the growth of the
cultured cells were examined with colorimetry
using
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide (mtt) assay kits (chemicon international inc.) as described elsewhere
(11, 12). brieﬂy, the cells (1.5–8  103 cells per
well) were seeded on 96-well plates (nunc inc.,
roskilde, denmark), cultured for 24 h, and the
culture medium was changed to a new medium
with or without peg-ifn-a2b (16, 64, 256, 1024,
or 4096 iu/ml). after culturing for 24, 48, 72 or
96 h, the number of viable cells was measured
with immunomini nj-2300 (nalge nunc international, tokyo, japan) by setting the test wavelength at 570 nm and the reference wavelength at
630 nm. to keep the optical density within linear
range, all experiments were performed while the
cells were in the logarithmic growth phase. the
effects of ifn-a2b on the growth of the cell lines
were also examined in the same manner.
morphological observation

for morphological observation under a light
microscope, cultured cells were seeded on lab965

yano et al.
tek tissue culture chamber slides (nunc inc.),
cultured with or without peg-ifn-a2b (256,
1024 or 4096 iu/ml) for 72 h, ﬁxed for 10 min in
carnoy’s solution, and stained with hematoxylin–
eosin (he).
quantitative analysis of peg-ifn-a2b-induced apoptosis
in vitro

the cells cultured with or without 1000 iu/ml
peg-ifn-a2b for 72 h were stained with the
 xxxg166xxx -egfp (enhanced green ﬂuorescent
protein) apoptosis detection kits (medical &
biological laboratories co., ltd.) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. after staining, the
cells were analyzed using a facscan (becton
dickinson immunocytometry systems, san jose,
ca), and  xxxg166xxx -egfp-positive apoptotic
cell rate was determined.
effects of peg-ifn-a2b on the proliferation and
expression of the  xxxg1138xxx -2 subunit

to investigate the expression of the  xxxg1138xxx -2
subunit after continuous contact of peg-ifna2b as well as its relationship with antiproliferative effects, hak-1b cells were cultured with
medium alone (control) or medium containing
1000 iu/ml of peg-ifn-a2b for 0, 3, 24, 48, 72,
96, 144, 192 or 240 h. the viable cell number and
the cell surface expression of the  xxxg1138xxx -2 subunit were examined. the cell surface expression of
the  xxxg1138xxx -2 subunit was analyzed using ﬂow
cytometry with the technique described elsewhere
(11) with slight modiﬁcation. brieﬂy, the cells
were reacted with anti-ifn a/b receptor chain 2
antibody (ﬁnal concentration, 2.5 mg/ml) or control antibody for 1 h, washed once, incubated
with 4 ml of fitc-gam for 30 min, washed
once, ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min,
washed, and analyzed with a facscan. the
expression levels were compared according to
the mean channel number. as an internal control
to conﬁrm that cell surface protein level on hak1b cells treated with or without 1000 iu/ml of
peg-ifn-a2b is constant, egf receptor expression was measured on the cells cultured for 240 h
in the same manner. after culturing for 72 h, cell
cycle analysis was also performed in hak-1b
cells cultured with or without 1000 iu/ml of
peg-ifn-a2b with the technique described elsewhere (11). brieﬂy, cells were labeled with 10 mm
brdu (sigma chemical co., st louis, mo) for
30 min, harvested, ﬁxed in 70% cold ethanol at
4 1c overnight, stained with anti-brdu and  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (sigma chemical co.), and analyzed by using a facscan.

effects of peg-ifn-a2b and ifn-a2b on hcc cell
proliferation in nude mice

cultured hak-1b (107 cells/mouse) was subcutaneously (sc) injected into the backs of 5-weekold female balb/c athymic nude mice (clea
japan inc., osaka, japan). five to seven days
later when the largest diameter of the tumor
reached approximately 5–10 mm (day 0), the
mice were divided into seven groups (n 5 6–9
each) in the ﬁrst experiment (experiment #1)
and into ﬁve groups (n 5 7 or 8 each) in the
second experiment (experiment #2) in a manner
to equalize the mean tumor diameter of every
group. in experiment #1, each mouse received a
sc injection of 0.1 ml of medium alone (control),
medium containing 640, 6400, 64 000, or
640 000 iu of peg-ifn-a2b, or medium containing 6400 or 64 000 iu of ifn-a2b, twice a week
for two consecutive weeks (day 1, day 4, day 8,
and day 11). experiment #2 was conducted in the
same manner but 640 and 6400 iu/mouse of
peg-ifn-a2b and the same doses of ifn-a2b
were used. the aim of experiment #2 was to
examine the reproducibility of the antitumor
effects of peg-ifn-a2b at low concentrations
and to compare this activity to that of ifn-a2b.
the clinical dose of peg-ifn-a2b in chronic
hepatitis c treatment is 9.6  104 iu/kg and is
three times the lowest dose (3.2  104 iu/kg) in
the experiment. during this 2-week period, tumor
size was measured in two directions using calipers
on the ﬁrst and second days of sc injection (day 1
and day 2) and then once every 2 days until day
14, and tumor volume (mm3) was estimated using
the equation ‘length  (width)2  0.5’. mouse
body weight was measured on day 0, day 8,
and day 14. on day 15, the mice were sacriﬁced
and the tumors were resected and weighed and
used for morphological studies (e.g., he staining
and immunohistochemistry) and elisa analysis.
every mouse received an intraperitoneal injection
of 1 mg of brdu 30 min before sacriﬁce.
the animals received human care according to
the criteria outlined in the ‘guide for the care
and use of laboratory animals’ prepared by the
national academy of sciences and published by
the national institutes of health (nih publication 86-23 revised 1985).
morphological examination of the subcutaneous tumors of
nude mice

the number of cells showing the characteristics of
apoptosis (e.g., cytoplasmic shrinkage, chromatin
condensation, and nuclear fragmentation) was
counted in ten 0.25 mm2 areas within an hestained specimen of the ﬁrst experiment, and the

growth inhibition of hepatoma cells by peg-ifn-a2b
average number per area was obtained. the
appearance of apoptotic cells was conﬁrmed by
the immunohistochemical detection of vimentin
fragment (v1), i.e., a marker for caspase-9 activation (30), with the speciﬁc antibody and histomouset-plus kits (zymed laboratories inc.,
ca). the specimens were also immunostained
for incorporated brdu using brdu staining
kits (oncogene research products, boston,
ma), and the average number of positive cells
per area was obtained as described above. in
addition, double-immunostaining was performed
with anti-mouse endothelial cell antibody, antihuman a-sma antibody, histoﬁne simple stain
mouse max-po (rat) kits (nichirei, tokyo,
japan), and histomouset-plus kits to detect
artery-like blood vessels as described in our previous report (12, 31). the number of blood vessels
in the tumor nodule was counted on each specimen. the size of the counted area was traced and
measured using turbocad software (imsi, novato, ca). from the number of vessels per unit
area (mm2) obtained, the group mean was obtained for group comparison.
elisa

the tumors were cut into pieces, and an appropriate amount was homogenized in 500 ml of icecold ca21- and mg21-free phosphate-buffered
saline containing 100 mg/ml phenymethylsulfonyl
ﬂuoride using a pellet pestle. the mixture was
centrifuged for 10 min (12 000 g, 4 1c), and the
supernatant was stored at  20 1c until use.
the amount of the  xxxg1138xxx -2 subunit in the
supernatant was measured using elisa kits
(otsuka pharmaceutical co. ltd., tokyo, japan).
the amount of tissue protein was determined
using a bca protein assay reagent (pierce, rockford, il).
statistics

comparisons of estimated tumor volume and
colorimetric cell growth were performed using
two-factor factorial anova and student’s ttest, respectively. the other data comparisons
were performed using the mann–whitney u-test.
results

effects of peg-ifn-a2b on liver cancer cell proliferation
in vitro

twenty-four hours after the addition of 4096 iu/
ml of peg-ifn-a2b, mild increase in the relative
viable cell number occurred in 10 cell lines (all cell
lines except hak-1b, hak-6, and kmch-1).

however, after 72 h or later, a 10% or more
decrease in the cell number occurred in 12 cell
lines (fig. 1a). in hak-3, proliferation was not
suppressed but slightly promoted up to 96 h of
peg-ifn-a2b contact. in hak-2 and hak-4,
proliferation was suppressed up to 72 h and the
cell number reached a plateau thereafter. in the
other 10 cell lines, proliferation was suppressed to
varying degrees up to 96 h.
ninety-six hours after the addition of pegifn-a2b, the relative viable cell number was
suppressed in nine cell lines (all cell lines except
hak-2, hak-3, hak-4, and kmch-2) in a
dose-dependent manner (fig. 1b). in four cell
lines (kyn-2, hak-1b, kyn-1, and kim-1),
the number was suppressed to 50% or less with
4096 iu/ml of peg-ifn-a2b, and the 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) was 831.8 iu/ml
for kyn-2, 839.0 iu/ml for hak-1b,
1298.6 iu/ml for kyn-1, and 3396.4 iu/ml for
kim-1. the ic50 of non-peg-ifn-a2b in the
four cell lines was 918.5, 627.7, 1237.7, and
2617.8 iu/ml, respectively, which was not signiﬁcantly different from that of peg-ifn-a2b
(paired student’s t-test). no relationship was
detected between the histological differentiation
level of the original tumor and sensitivity to the
antiproliferative effect of peg-ifn-a2b.
seventy-two hours after adding 4096 iu/ml of
peg-ifn-a2b, 10 cell lines (all cell lines except
hak-2, hak-3, and kmch-2) presented characteristics of apoptosis, e.g., cytoplasmic shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and nuclear
fragmentation, to various degrees (fig. 2).
quantitative analysis of  xxxg166xxx -egfp-positive apoptotic cells revealed that the appearance
of apoptosis was signiﬁcantly higher in the cultures with 1000 iu/ml of peg-ifn-a2b than
those without peg-ifn-a2b in nine cell lines
(table 1).
effects of peg-ifn-a2b on the proliferation and
expression of  xxxg1138xxx -2 in vitro

with continuous contact of peg-ifn-a2b up to
240 h, the expression of  xxxg1138xxx -2 in hak-1b
cells was signiﬁcantly down-regulated at 3 h compared with the control, then signiﬁcantly upregulated at 48 h, and signiﬁcantly down-regulated in the period between 96 and 240 h (fig.
3a). to check the speciﬁcity of the down-regulation of  xxxg1138xxx -2 expression, the expression of
egf receptor was also analyzed at 240 h. the
mean channel numbers of hak-1b cells cultured
with and without 1000 iu/ml of peg-ifn-a2b
were 10.1  0.4 and 10.6  0.9, respectively, and
there was no signiﬁcant difference in egf recep967

the tumors of the mice that received 6400 iu of
peg-ifn-a2b tended to be smaller in volume in

cantly lower in weight than that of ifn-a2b in
experiment #2 (po0.03). at the end of the
experiments, the estimated tumor volume in the
mice that received 640 iu of peg-ifn-a2b
(3.2  104 iu/kg, about 1/3 of the clinical dose
9.6  104 iu/kg) in experiments #1 and #2 became 42% and 58% of the control, respectively.
in the mice that received 640 000 iu of peg-ifna2b, the tumors disappeared on the 14th day.
peg-ifn-a2b administration did not affect the
body weight of the mice (table 2).
histological examination of the hak-1b tumor specimens stained with he revealed that the
numbers of apoptotic cells in the mice treated
with peg-ifn-a2b (640–64 000 iu) or ifn-a2b
(64 000 iu) were signiﬁcantly higher than that of
the control, and the number increased dose
dependently (fig. 5a–c; table 3). immunostaining of vimentin fragment (v1) that is a marker for
caspase-9 activation showed a positive reaction in
the cytoplasm of the apoptotic cells (fig. 5d).
no signiﬁcant difference was observed in the
number of blood vessels per unit area of the
hak-1b tumor between the control and the
peg-ifn-a2b or ifn-a2b group (table 3).
immunohistochemical examination of brdu

discussion

peg-ifn-a2b induced a time-dependent antiproliferative effect in 10 cell lines in contact
with 4096 iu/ml of peg-ifn-a2b for 24–96 h
and a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect in
nine cell lines in vitro in the range of 16 and
4096 iu/ml. on an antiviral unit basis, the antiproliferative activity of peg-ifn-a2b was not
signiﬁcantly different from that of non-pegifn-a2b in vitro based on ic50 values. compared with ball-1 ifn-a that consists of the a2
subtype (about 75%) and the a8 subtype (25%)
or with ifn-acon1, both peg-ifn-a2b and
ifn-a2b showed low antiproliferative activity in
terms of relative viable cell number and ic50 (11,
12). this is consistent with our recent ﬁnding, i.e.,
that the antiproliferative activity of the ifn-a2
subtype in vitro is relatively weak compared with
other ifn-a subtypes such as a5, a10 and a8
(32). as a mechanism of antiproliferation, apoptosis induction was observed in 9 cell lines
that received 1000 iu/ml of peg-ifn-a2b (morphological changes occurred in 10 cell lines with
4096 iu/ml). ifn-acon1 that possesses the most
potent antiproliferative effect among the three
ifn-a preparations induced apoptosis in all 13
hcc cell lines at a similar concentration (12).
the four cell lines (hak-2, hak-3, hak-4, and
kmch-2) in which peg-ifn-a2b did not induce a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect
showed the highest ic50 values (4100 000 iu/
ml) to ifn-a2 subtype among the 13 cell lines
(32) and showed resistance to peg-ifn-a2bmediated apoptosis (hak-2, hak-3, and
kmch-2) and/or low cell surface  xxxg1138xxx -2
expression (hak-3, hak-4, and kmch-2) (11).
when ifn-a binds to its receptors, the ifnreceptor-complexes are internalized and degradated intracellularly (33, 34). it was demonstrated
that ifn-a down-regulates type i ifn receptors
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc,
(35–37)). nakajima et al. (36) reported that the
number of ifn receptors on pbmc in patients
with chronic hepatitis b decreased to about 50%
of the baseline with a ﬁvefold increase in 2 0 ,5 0 oligoadenylate synthetase activity when the patients were treated with ifn for 2 or 4 weeks. to
date, however, there have been no studies on the
down-regulation of ifn receptors and its relationship with the antiproliferative effects of ifna in liver cancer cells. human type i ifn receptor
consists of two subunits,  xxxg1138xxx -1 and  xxxg1138xxx   xxxg1139xxx .  xxxg1138xxx -2 is the binding subunit and is more
important than  xxxg1138xxx -1 for the expression of
ifn activity (3, 38, 39). therefore, the current
study chronologically examined the relationship
972

between the antiproliferative effect and the expression of the  xxxg1138xxx -2 subunit in hak-1b
cells up to 240 h after the addition of peg-ifna2b. we chose hak-1b for this study because
this cell line expresses the highest  xxxg1138xxx -2
subunit expression among the 13 liver cancer
cell lines (11) and because this cell line was also
selected for the in vivo experiment, allowing
comparison of results in the in vitro setting with
those in vivo. the expression of  xxxg1138xxx -2 subunit
was signiﬁcantly down-regulated at 3 h compared
with the control and then signiﬁcantly up-regulated at 48 h. expression then decreased in a timedependent manner after 72 h, and the viable cell
number continuously decreased with time. the
down-regulation of  xxxg1138xxx -2 was the speciﬁc
change because another cell surface protein, i.e.,
egf receptor, was not down-regulated at 240 h
compared with control. therefore, at least for
the hcc cell line, hak-1b, in an in vitro setting,
the  xxxg1138xxx -2 subunit is down-regulated but an
efﬁcient antiproliferative effect is induced with
continuous contact with peg-ifn-a2b. lau
et al. (35) studied the binding characteristics of
ifn-a to pbmc in patients with chronic hepatitis b virus infection and reported a possible
increase in binding afﬁnity of the remaining
receptors as a reason for the continuous effects
of ifn-a in long-term ifn therapy that reduces
the number of ifn-a receptors. on the other
hand, dooley et al. (40) reported a decrease in
binding afﬁnity. therefore, this point also needs
to be further studied on hak-1b and other hcc
cell lines.
we then examined the in vivo antitumor effects
of peg-ifn-a2b on mice. twice-a-week administration of peg-ifn-a2b dose-dependently suppressed the growth of sc transplanted human
hcc. the growth was effectively suppressed
even at 1/3 of the clinical dose in patients with
chronic hepatitis c, and the tumor size was
reduced to 42–58% of the control. this antiproliferative effect was equivalent to the effect
of a consecutive 14-day administration of an
approximately 1.3 times larger clinical dose of
ifn-acon1 (12). the antiproliferative effect of
peg-ifn-a2b in vitro is lower than ifn-acon1;
therefore, our in vivo ﬁnding would be understood as the serum half-time of ifn-a2b becoming longer due to pegylation, then peg-ifn-a2b
at a high concentrations remaining in the serum
for a long time to affect tumor cells, resulting in
much stronger antitumor effects. this consideration is also supported by our results, i.e., pegifn-a2b and ifn-a2b in vitro presented the same
antiproliferative effects; however, in vivo, ifna2b presented signiﬁcantly weaker antitumor

growth inhibition of hepatoma cells by peg-ifn-a2b
effects than peg-ifn-a2b. in addition,  xxxg1138xxx   xxxg1139xxx  expression in the tumor of mice decreased,
particularly in mice that received peg-ifna2b. this was considered to be due to  xxxg1138xxx   xxxg1139xxx  expression being down-regulated as a result of
the long-term continuous action of peg-ifna2b, and this is consistent with the in vitro
ﬁndings. the above indicates that even if  xxxg1138xxx -2 expression is down-regulated, antitumor
effect does not decrease but, in fact, increases due
to continuous action. in contrast, krepler et al.
(41) compared antitumor effects of peg-ifna2a and non-peg-ifn-a2a in a human melanoma scid mouse xenotransplantation model
and found no signiﬁcant differences in tumor
growth inhibition. we presume that this opposite
result is attributable to the difference in the
experimental conditions. for example, in their
study, mice received extremely high doses of pegand non-peg-ifn-a2a, i.e., mice received 900 mg
of peg-ifn-a2a (45 000 mg/kg) that is ﬁve or 10
times larger than the clinical dose for chronic
hepatitis c patients (90–180 mg/body, 1.8–3.6 mg/
kg). in addition, it is not clear whether the
amounts of peg- and non-peg-ifn-a2a administrated to mice were equivalent in antiproliferative effects on the melanoma cells in vitro.
the induction of apoptosis is known as a
mechanism of the in vivo antiproliferation activity
of peg-ifn-a2b. however, the induction of sphase arrest that was observed in vitro was not
clear in vivo in terms of the labeling index of
brdu. this was the same as the ﬁnding on the
mechanism of the antiproliferation activity of
ifn-acon1 in mouse tumor (12). it is surmized
that apoptosis holds the dominant position over
the s-phase arrest when tumor cells in vivo were
treated with ifn-a for 2 weeks. this point should
be further investigated. antiangiogenesis activity
is one of the biological effects of ifn-a, and the
administration of ifn-a to patients with vascular
tumors, e.g., kaposi sarcoma, results in the signiﬁcant regression of tumor lesions (1, 4). ifn
administration suppresses the growth of human
tumor that was transplanted to mice through an
antiangiogenesis effect (12, 31, 42–45). tedjarati
et al. (44) found that once per week injection of
7000 iu of peg-ifn-a2b into nude mice bearing
ip growing human ovarian carcinoma cells inhibited angiogenesis and tumor growth and that
peg-ifn-a2b administered at higher or lower
doses was less effective. in our current study,
however, signiﬁcant antiangiogenesis effect was
not observed at any dose. in another study that
we conducted examining a consecutive 14-day
administration of 5000 iu/mouse/day of ball1 ifn-a to mice that had subcutaneous trans-

plantation of hak-1b tumor, a slight increase in
the number of blood vessels and an increase of
the three angiogenesis factors were observed (46).
on the other hand, another study that used 0.01
or 0.1 mg/mouse of ifn-acon1 showed a signiﬁcant decrease in the number of blood vessels (12).
further studies are necessary both in vitro and in
vivo with various ifns such as ifn-a and ifn-b
to clarify whether the antiangiogenesis effects are
attributable to the type of ifn. in addition, more
studies are also needed to investigate the mechanism of antiproliferative effects including antiangiogenesis, the expression of  xxxg1138xxx -2 and its
relationship to antiproliferative effects using
other hcc cells.
in the hcc cell line hak-1b, continuous
contact with peg-ifn-a2b induced the downregulation of  xxxg1138xxx -2 and a potent antiproliferative effect that is stronger than the effects of
non-peg-ifn-a2b. the antitumor effect of
peg-ifn-a2b was expressed at approximately
1/3 of the clinical dose, and this suggests that
peg-ifn-a2b administration to patients with
chronic hepatitis c would be effective in the
prevention of hepatocarcinogenesis and the recurrence of hcc.
