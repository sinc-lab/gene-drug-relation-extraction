abstract insecticides are the most important component in the vector-control effort and pyrethroids such as permethrin are widely used for the indoor control of mosquitoes worldwide.
however, the widespread development of resistance to pyrethroids is becoming a major problem. the
current study reports an extensive survey of permethrin resistance in alabama designed to characterize the importance of the l-to-f  xxxg1274xxx  mutation in pyrethroid resistant culex mosquitoes. mosquitoes
were collected from 19 counties, 17 in alabama and two from neighboring counties in florida and
tennessee. culex quinquefasciatus say from all the counties tested were found to have developed
resistance to permethrin. seventy one percent of the þeld population from alabama exhibited
relatively low levels of resistance, with resistance ratios ranging from 71 to 390; 11% had medium/high
levels of resistance, with resistance ratios ranging from 810 to 830; and the remaining18% had high
levels of resistance, with resistance ratios ranging from 1,100 to 1,400. most of the mosquito populations
tested showed a strong correlation between their level of resistance and the frequency of l-to-f
mutation expression, suggesting the importance of target site insensitivity in the development of
permethrin resistance. however, four populations with elevated levels of resistance showed no l-to-f
mutation in their sodium channels. although it is possible that other mutations other than l-to-f are
present in the sodium channel, resulting in permethrin resistance in these four þeld populations,
resistance mechanisms other than target site insensitivity also must be considered.

vector control of mosquitoes has long been a critical
part of the current global strategy to control mosquitoassociated diseases (who 2000a,b,c) and insecticides
are the most important component in the vector-control effort. pyrethroids such as permethrin are currently the most widely used insecticides for the indoor
control of mosquitoes worldwide and are the only
chemical recommended for the treatment of mosquito
nets, the main tool for preventing malaria in africa
(zaim et al. 2000). however, the widespread development of resistance to pyrethroids and the fact that
resistance to a pyrethroid also generally confers crossresistance to other insecticides have become important issues confronting the mosquito control effort
(hemingway et al. 2002, zaim and guillet 2002).
pyrethroids target the sodium channel proteins (sodium channels) within the nervous system of insects.

sensitivity to ddt and pyrethroids in the sodium
channels of the insect nervous system by either reducing or eliminating the binding afþnity of the
insecticides to proteins (narahashi 1988). consequently, the toxic effects of these insecticides diminish
and the insects develop insecticide resistance (soderlund 2005). a substitution of leucine to phenylalanine
(l-to-f) resulting from a single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp), termed the  xxxg1274xxx  mutation, in the sodium
channel gene has been identiþed as a very important
mutation associated with so-called  xxxg1274xxx -mediated pyrethroid resistance in different insect species, including mosquitoes (williamson et al. 1996; dong 1997;
martinez-torres et al. 1999; soderlund 2005; xu et al.
2006a,b).
culex quinquefasciatus say is a nuisance species and
important vector throughout the wet tropics. in the
southeastern united states, this species is moderately
competent as a vector of west nile virus (family flaviviridae, genus flavivirus, wnv) (sardelis et al.
2001) and is a primary vector of saint louis encephalitis virus (family flaviviridae, genus flavivirus) in
many urban settings (jones et al. 2002). in alabama,
cx. quinquefasciatus is the predominant mosquito species in urban areas. current approaches to controlling
mosquitoes in the state rely primarily on source reduction and the application of insecticides for both
larval and adult mosquitoes (liu et al. 2004a,b). this

liu et al.: permethrin resistance in alabama mosquitoes

strategy has been followed for more than a decade,
with the insecticides used being primarily pyrethroids
and organophosphates. however, difþculties in controlling mosquito populations are begun to be reported and increasing the dosage and frequency of
insecticide applications and/or changing to different
insecticides is now frequently necessary.
recently, two alabama culex strains, hamcqg0
and mamcqg0 collected from huntsville and mobile,
respectively, have demonstrated their ability to develop resistance and/or cross-resistance to not only
pyrethroids and organophosphates (ops), but also
relatively new insecticides such as þpronil and imidacloprid (liu et al. 2004b). the l-to-f mutation
(termed the  xxxg1274xxx  mutation) resulting from a single
nucleotide polymorphism (adenine to thymine, a to
t) in the sodium channel of culex mosquitoes has
been found to be correlated with the levels of pyrethroid resistance in these alabama mosquito strains
(xu et al. 2006a). it seems likely that the ability to
develop resistance and/or cross-resistance to insecticides, including pyrethroids, in alabamaõs cx. quinquefasciatus population is a common phenomenon and
the l-to-f  xxxg1274xxx  mutation is one of the most important
causes of the development of pyrethroid resistance.
here, we report a comprehensive survey of permethrin resistance in alabamaõs culex mosquitoes and
use the results to characterize the importance of the
l-to-f  xxxg1274xxx  mutation in the development of resistance
to pyrethroids. mosquitoes were collected from 17
counties in alabama and two neighboring counties in
tennessee and florida. cx. quinquefasciatus from most
of the counties exhibited some level of resistance to
permethrin, and in most of the mosquitoes there was
a correlation between their level of resistance and the
incidence of the l-to-f mutation.
materials and methods
mosquito collection. the mosquitoes were collected using the method described by reiter (1983),
with some modiþcation. in brief, the hay infusion used
to attract oviposition of cx. mosquitoes was prepared
with dried bermuda hay (250 g), brewerõs yeast (5 g),
lactalbumen (5 g), and water (15 gal). the mixture
was allowed to incubate at 28 ð30⬚c for 5 d before use.
the hay infusion trap sessions were initiated in the late
afternoon and mosquito eggs were collected ⬇24 h
later. four traps were placed at each site, and these
were later used for the replications of the insecticide
bioassay. mosquito egg rafts from each site were separated in the laboratory and reared in 1.9-gal (⬃6.5
liter) containers with regular tap water until the
fourth-instar larval and/or adult stages, which then
were used for the bioassays and snp determination of
l-to-f  xxxg1274xxx  allelic expression (xu et al. 2006a, b).
bioassays. the stock and serial dilutions of permethrin were prepared in acetone. the bioassay
method for permethrin was as described by mulla et
al. (1982), ali et al. (1999), and liu et al. (2004a,b);
each bioassay consisted of 30 fourth-instar mosquito
larvae in six oz. sweetheart ice cream cups (sweet-

1425

heart cup co., owings mills, md) with regular tap
water and 1% insecticide solution in acetone at the
required concentration and four or þve concentrations that resulted in ⬎0 and ⬍100% mortality; control
groups received only 1% acetone. mortality was assessed after 24 h. all tests were run at 25⬚c and replicated at least three times on different days. bioassay
data were pooled and probit analysis was conducted
using abbottõs correction for control mortality (abbott 1925). statistical analysis of lc50 values and lc90
values was based on nonoverlapping 95% conþdence
intervals. resistance ratios (rrs) were calculated by
dividing the lc50 of the resistant þeld strains by the
lc50 of the susceptible s-lab strain.
ampliﬁcation of the alleles at the l-to-f  xxxg1274xxx  site.
fifteen males and 15 females of the mosquito population from each site had their rna extracted for each
experiment. three primers were designed to amplify
the sodium channel cdna fragments from all the
mosquito populations:  xxxg1274xxx  s1 (5⬘ cttactcatttccatcatgg 3⬘), pg  xxxg1274xxx  as5 (5⬘ gctggttgtgctccttgacgc 3⬘), and  xxxg1274xxx  al s1 (5⬘ gcgttaggtaatctgacgtttgtgc 3⬘), generating
amplicons that spanned the intron/exon boundaries
(⬇10 kb) but did not amplify the genomic dna
(cpij007595). in this way, any inßuence due to
genomic dna contamination was eliminated. two
rounds of polymerase chain reaction (pcr) were conduced. the þrst pcr solution, containing the cdna
template and a primer pair ( xxxg1274xxx  s1 and pg  xxxg1274xxx 
as5), was heated to 95⬚c for 1 min, followed by 40
cycles of pcr reaction (94⬚c for 30 s, 55⬚c for 30 s, and
72⬚c for 2 min) and a þnal extension of 72⬚c for 10 min.
the second pcr, containing 1 ␮l of the þrst round
pcr reaction solution and a primer pair ( xxxg1274xxx  al s1
and pg  xxxg1274xxx  as5) was conducted under the same
reaction conditions described above except that 38
cycles and a 60⬚c annealing temperature were used.
snp determination for the  xxxg1274xxx  allele. the alleles at
the l-to-f site in culex mosquitoes were investigated
by snp determination by using an abi prism snapshot multiplex kit and analyzed on the abi prism 3100
genetic analyzer with genemapper software (applied biosystems, foster city, ca) as described by xu
et al. (2005, 2006a b). the pcr products generated
from the cdna of 30 individual mosquitoes of each
population were used for snp determination. the
primer, 5⬘ ggccaccgtagtgataggaaattt 3⬘,
for snp determination was designed according to the
sequence immediately upstream of the  xxxg1274xxx  allele.
three replications of the snp determination were
carried out using the same cdna for each individual,
with different preparations of the pcr templates. to
conþrm that our pcr products were in fact the  xxxg1274xxx 
gene fragments, we sequenced the pcr products from
each sample at least once.

and mobile, respectively, have demonstrated their
ability to develop resistance to permethrin (liu et al.
2004b). these two strains have also been shown to be
cross-resistance to deltamethrin and ops, as well as
relatively new insecticides such as þpronil and imidacloprid (liu et al. 2004b). the current study reports
an extensive survey of permethrin resistance in alabama cx. mosquitoes to investigate whether the ability
to develop resistance to permethrin in culex quinquefasciatus is a common phenomenon in the state of
alabama. mosquitoes were collected from 17 representative counties scattered throughout the state (table 1). in addition, two mosquito populations from
fort walton beach, okaloosa county, fl, and nashville, davidson county, tn, were collected for the
purposes of comparison. three to four traps were
located at each site and served as the replications for
the bioassay and snp determination. to evaluate the
susceptibility or resistance of the mosquitoes to the
permethrin insecticides, permethrin was applied to
the fourth-instar larvae of mosquito populations of cx.
quinquefasciatus (liu et al. 2004b). the lab susceptible
cx. quinquefasciatus strain s-lab was used as a standard susceptible population for estimating the resistance ratios (fig. 1) in these þeld culex populations by
dividing the lc50 (table 1) of each of the þeld populations by that for the s-lab strain. our study indicated that all the þeld populations tested had developed some level of resistance to permethrin compared
with the s-lab strain; none of the þeld populations
exhibited susceptibilities that were even close to that
of the susceptible s-lab population.
based on overlapping 95% conþdence intervals (table 1, liu et al. 2004b), three signiþcantly different
levels of resistance, relatively low, medium/high, and
high, were represented in the mosquito populations in

alabama (fig. 1). the relatively low resistance ratios
(from 71 to 390) were observed for culex mosquitoes
from auburn (lee county), tuskegee (macon
county), tallapoosa (elmore county), letohatchee
(lowndes county), brewton (escambia county),
crewsville (coosa county), talladega (talladega
county), blountsville (blount county), hanceville
(cullman county), hartselle (morgan county), athens (limestone county), and huntsville (madison
county). the lowest of these was observed in blount
county, with a resistance ratio of 71. approximately
71% of the total tested populations from alabama had
relatively low levels of resistance to permethrin. the
medium/high levels of resistance were observed in the
culex populations from greenville (butler county) and
birmingham (jefferson county) with resistance ratios of
830 and 810, respectively, making up 11% of the alabama
total. the populations from montgomery (montgomery
county), evergreen (conecuh county), and mobile
(mobile county) had the highest levels of resistance to
permethrin, with resistance ratios ranging from 1,100
to 1,400. consequently, approximately 16% of the total
tested populations from alabama had relatively high
levels of resistance to permethrin. the gradual slopes
of the doseðresponse curves for permethrin in most
tested þeld populations compared with that in the
s-lab strain indicated that the þeld populations of
culex mosquitoes were heterozygous in response to
pyrethroids (liu et al. 2004b). the mosquito population collected from locations adjacent to the alabama
state line in nashville, davidson county, tennessee,
and fort walton beach, okaloosa county, fl, also
showed elevated levels of resistance to permethrin,
with resistance ratios of 170 and 390, respectively.
taken together, these results suggest that resistance to
permethrin is not only a common phenomenon in þeld

target site insensitivity as a mechanism in the field
populations of cx. quinquefasciatus. xu et al. (2005,
2006a) reported that the l-to-f  xxxg1274xxx  mutation resulting
from a snp (adenine to thymine, a to t) in the
mosquito sodium channel is an important factor that
dramatically reduces the sensitivity of the channel to
pyrethroids and, in turn, leads to the development of
pyrethroid resistance in culex mosquitoes (xu et al.
2006a). for the current study, we investigated variations in the expression of a and/or t alleles at the
l-to-f  xxxg1274xxx  locus in each of mosquito populations to
determine whether there is indeed a correlation between the frequency of  xxxg1274xxx  allelic expression in the
mosquito populations and their levels of permethrin
resistance using the snp determination method (xu at
al. 2006a,b, liu et al. 2006). the pcr product from the
cdna of each individual was sequenced and in all
cases the pcr sequences ampliþed from cdna were
the sodium channel gene fragments.
we compared the frequency of alleles (a and/or t)
in the  xxxg1274xxx  locus at the rna level in the þeld populations. a strong correlation between the prevalence of
the  xxxg1274xxx  allele expression at the rna level and the level
of pyrethroid resistance were found in most of the
culex mosquito populations tested (table 2). in
the susceptible s-lab cx. quinquefasciatus, 100% of the
individuals expressed the susceptible allele a, generating a codon encoding leu corresponding to the
susceptibility in this strain to insecticides (table 2).
this contrasts strongly with the population collected
from evergreen, conecuh county, that exhibited the
highest level of resistance to permethrin (1,400-fold).
here, 100% of the individuals showed expression of
the t allele, resulting in a change of leu to phe (table
2), which strongly correlated with the high levels of

resistance in this population. the populations from
crewsville, blountsville, hanceville, hartselle, athens, and huntsville, as well as nashville, tn, all of
which had relatively low levels of resistance (resistance ratios from 71 to 390) showed expression frequencies ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 for individuals that
expressed only the susceptible allele a, 0.25ð 0.43 for
those that expressed both alleles, and 0.10 ð 0.37 for
those that expressed the  xxxg1274xxx  allele t. the populations
from greenville and birmingham that had medium/
high levels of resistance (resistance ratios from 810 to
830) showed frequencies ranging from 0.17 to 0.2 for
individuals that expressed only the susceptible allele
a, 0.30 ð 0.40 for those that expressed both alleles, and
0.43ð 0.50 for those that expressed the  xxxg1274xxx  allele t.
populations from greenville and birmingham with
relatively high levels of resistance (resistance ratios of
1,200 and 1,100, respectively) showed expression frequencies ranging from 0.13 to 0.15 for individuals that
expressed only the susceptible allele a, 0.25ð 0.30 for
those that expressed both alleles, and 0.62ð 0.55, for
those that expressed the  xxxg1274xxx  allele t. it has been
suggested that there is inevitably a large portion of the
þeld insect population that avoids exposure to insecticide selection pressure, thus providing a pool of
susceptible individuals that then repopulate the resistant portions selected by insecticides (georghiou and
taylor 1977). our study indicates that the allelic variation pattern for the  xxxg1274xxx  locus in these þeld mosquito
populations is strongly correlated with their levels of
resistance (liu et al. 2004a,b) and the proportions of
susceptible, intermediate, and resistant individuals, as
suggested by georghiou and taylor (1977). the
strong correlation of the  xxxg1274xxx  (t) allelic expression at
the l-to-f  xxxg1274xxx  locus with the corresponding elevated
levels of resistance in these þeld populations suggest
that the target site insensitivity that results from the
l-to-f  xxxg1274xxx  mutation is an important mechanism for the

development of permethrin resistance in the þeld
population of cx. quinquefasciatus.
however, although we can now conþdently state
that the l-to-f  xxxg1274xxx  mutation is very important in the
evolution of resistance development, it is unlikely to
be the sole mechanism responsible for such a widespread phenomenon as  xxxg1274xxx -mediated resistance. in
particular, ⬎20 sodium channel mutations have already been identiþed as being involved in reducing
channel sensitivity to insecticides or neurotoxins in
different insect species (soderlund and knipple
2003). in work reported elsewhere, our group isolated
the full-length sodium channel cdnas from s-lab,
hamcqg0, mamcqg0, and hamcqg8, the offspring
of hamcqg0 mosquitoes that had been further selected with permethrin in laboratory for eight generations and thus gained a markedly higher level of
resistance than its parental strain hamcqg0 (xu et al.
2006a). comparison of the entire sodium channel cdna
sequences across these four strains revealed multiple
mutations presented throughout the culex mosquito sodium channels (q.x. et al., unpublished data). this interesting þnding suggests that multiple mutations may
coexist in the mosquito sodium channel that is involved
in pyrethroid resistance. although the current study focused on evaluating only the l-to-f mutation in resistant
þeld populations of cx. quinquefasciatus, the possibility
that additional mutations in their sodium channels may
also contribute to the development of permethrin resistance cannot be excluded.
the populations from macon, elmore, and escambia counties, all of which had relatively low levels of
resistance (230-, 130-, and 160-fold, respectively),
showed no individuals that expressed the susceptible
allele a and majority of individuals with the  xxxg1274xxx  allele
t (table 2). these results may suggest that the target

site insensitivity resulting from the l-to-f substitution
is indeed the major, if not the sole, mechanism responsible for the development of permethrin resistance in these mosquito populations. interestingly, we
also detected four populations in which elevated levels of resistance were presented but that had no l-to-f
mutation in their sodium channels. the mosquito populations from auburn, letohatchee, talladega, and
fort walton beach, fl, with resistance ratios of 260,
110, 290, and 170, respectively, were all composed of
individuals that expressed the susceptible allele a.
these results strongly suggest that target site insensitivity resulting from the l-to-f mutation in the permethrin resistance is not an important mechanism in
these four resistant þeld populations. although we
cannot exclude the possibility that mutations other
than l-to-f presented in the sodium channel are responsible for permethrin resistance in these four þeld
populations of culex mosquitoes, it is necessary to
consider alternative resistance mechanisms in addition to target site insensitivity. results from previous
studies (georghiou 1971; plapp 1984; raymond et al.
1989; liu and scott 1996; liu and yue 2000, 2001;
pridgeon and liu 2003; xu et al. 2005, 2006a; liu et al.
2007) indicate that the interaction of multiple insecticide resistance mechanisms or genes may be responsible for insecticide resistance. in particular, xu et al.
(2005) suggested that multiple mechanismsñin this
case p450-, esterase-, and glutathione transferase-mediated detoxiþcation and  xxxg1274xxx -mediated target site insensitivityñwere involved in the development of resistance in hamcq mosquitoes from alabama.
whether metabolic detoxiþcation enzymes are also
involved in detoxifying permethrin insecticide and
conferring permethrin resistance in these four mosquito populations needs further investigation.
