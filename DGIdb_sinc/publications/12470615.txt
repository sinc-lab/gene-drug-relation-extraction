abstract
the immune response modiﬁers,  xxxd2339xxx  and resiquimod, are  xxxg2291xxx  agonists that induce type i interferon in numerous
species, including humans. recently, it was shown that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pdc) are the primary interferon-producing
cells in the blood in response to viral infections. here, we characterize the activation of human pdc with the  xxxg2291xxx  agonists
 xxxd2339xxx  and resiquimod. results indicate that  xxxd2339xxx  and resiquimod induce ifn-a and ifn-x from puriﬁed pdc, and
pdc are the principle ifn-producing cells in the blood. resiquimod-stimulated pdc also produce a number of other cytokines
including  xxxg2296xxx  and  xxxg559xxx . resiquimod enhances co-stimulatory marker expression, ccr7 expression, and pdc viability. resiquimod was compared throughout the study to the pdc survival factors,  xxxg1177xxx  and ifn-a; resiquimod more eﬀectively matures
pdc than either  xxxg1177xxx  or ifn-a alone. these results demonstrate that imidazoquinoline molecules directly induce pdc maturation
as determined by cytokine induction, ccr7 and co-stimulatory marker expression and prolonging viability.

1. introduction
dendritic cells (dc1) constitute heterogeneous
populations of antigen presenting cells that are critical
for bridging the innate and the adaptive immune responses [1,2]. dc are found virtually in every tissue
and organ. in the blood, dc can be sub-divided into
two major populations, cd11cþ and  xxxg1208xxx  [3,4].
the cd11cþ population is thought to be myeloid*

derived, therefore called myeloid dc (mdc). the
 xxxg1208xxx  population appears to be lymphoid-derived
and constitutes a population of cells that can migrate
from the blood directly to lymphoid tissues. the
 xxxg1208xxx  population are called plasmacytoid dc
(pdc), because these cells have a morphology resembling plasma cells due to an extensive endoplasmic
reticulum [5,6]. technically, pdc in the blood are
precursor dc, unlike the mdc, because blood pdc
require further diﬀerentiation to up-regulate  xxxg396xxx 
and  xxxg398xxx , which is thought to occur in lymphoid
tissue, before they develop the capacity to stimulate tcell responses [7–10].
the blood  xxxg1208xxx  dc or pdc have recently been
shown to be the major type i ifn-producing cells in
response to virus infection [11,12]. type i ifns are

clinically important cytokines because of their use as
adjuvants for anti-viral and anti-cancer therapy. in addition to their direct anti-viral and anti-proliferative
aﬀects, type i interferons have multiple aﬀects on the
immune system including up-regulation of mhc class i
and ii, enhanced co-stimulatory marker expression on
dc, modulation of immunoglobulin production, synergizing with il-12 to enhance ifn-c production, and
augmentation of nk and ctl responses [4,13–17].
thus, type i ifn contributes to both innate and adaptive immunity.
potent inducers of ifn-a include the imidazoquinoline molecules. these molecules are classiﬁed as immune
response modiﬁers (irms) and constitute a family of
low molecular weight synthetic compounds that have
broad anti-viral and anti-tumor activity in numerous
animal models [18–25]. one such molecule,  xxxd2339xxx 
( xxxd2339xxx , 5% cream), is currently available for the
treatment of external genital and perianal warts caused
by human papillomavirus [26]. another molecule, resiquimod, has shown promise as a treatment for herpes
simplex virus infection and is currently in phase iii
clinical studies for the treatment of genital herpes [27].
the immunological mechanism of action of resiquimod
and  xxxd2339xxx  requires the activation of antigen presenting cells and production of various cytokines, particularly ifn-a, resulting in th1-like immunity. in
addition, resiquimod and  xxxd2339xxx  directly activate
innate immune responses through a  xxxg1489xxx /tlr7dependent pathway [28].
earlier studies indicated that monocytes were the
predominant ifn-a and pro-inﬂammatory cytokineproducing cells in the blood following imidazoquinoline
stimulation [29]. cell-depletion studies in vitro also
implicated monocytes as the primary ifn-producing
cells in the blood. four lines of evidence suggested that
we needed to re-investigate the question regarding
which populations of cells produce ifn-a in response to
imidazoquinoline molecules. first, dc recently have
been shown to be composed of a multitude of subsets
which produce diﬀerent types of cytokines following
activation. in response to viral infections, the pdc
subset is the predominant ifn-a-producing cell in the
blood [12]. second, similar to viral infections, imidazoquinoline molecules induce the production of high levels
of ifn-a from human peripheral blood. third, the
earlier published cell-depletion studies used antibody
that was directed to the cd11cþ population of blood
dc, thereby not eliminating the pdc subset [29].
fourth,  xxxd2339xxx - and resiquimod-induced cytokine
production are  xxxg1489xxx / xxxg2291xxx -dependent and pdc are
the prominent  xxxg2291xxx -expressing dc subset [28,30,31].
here, we evaluate the eﬀects of  xxxd2339xxx  and resiquimod on pdc function, including cytokine production,
co-stimulatory marker expression, ccr7 expression
and viability.

2. materials and methods
2.1. reagents
the  xxxg2291xxx  agonists resiquimod (r-848, s-28463), 4amino-2-ethoxymethyl-a,a-dimethyl-1h-imidazo[4,5-c]
quinoline-1-ethanol, mw ¼ 314.4, and  xxxd2339xxx 
( xxxd2339xxx ,  xxxd2339xxx ), 1-(2-methylpropyl)-1h-imidazo[4,5-c]
quinolin-4 xxxd2850xxx , mw ¼ 243.3 were dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso, sterile cell culture grade,
sigma, st. louis, mo) at a concentration of 12 mm and
stored in aliquots at )20 °c. resiquimod and  xxxd2339xxx  were added to cell cultures at various concentrations as described below. lps (salmonella minnesota)
was obtained from sigma and cpg oligonucleotide
(cpg2006,
tcgtcgttttgtcgttttgtcgttthiote) was obtained from invitrogen, carlsbad, ca.
antibodies used for positive selection and depletion of
pdc include bdca-2 and bdca-4 microbeads (miltenyi biotech, auburn, ca). biotin-labeled monoclonal
antibodies were used to obtain pdc by negative selection; these include cd3,  xxxg1206xxx ,  xxxg1208xxx , cd14,  xxxg375xxx ,
and cd56 (ancell, bayport, mn). antibodies and
ﬂuorochrome-labeled reagents for flow cytometry
include hla-dr-percp,  xxxg1178xxx  ( xxxg1177xxx -ra)-pe, cd80pe,  xxxg398xxx -pe, cd40-pe, biotin-labeled ccr7, streptavidin-pe,  xxxg2296xxx -fitc or pe, and il-12p40/70-fitc
or pe (bd pharmingen, san jose, ca) and ifn-a2fitc or pe (chromaprobe, aptos, ca). non-speciﬁc
binding to fc receptors was prevented using igg,
whole molecule (pierce, rockford, il) or fcr blocking reagent (miltenyi). intracellular flow cytometry
was performed using the cytostain kit containing
golgiplug (bd pharmingen). hsv-1 (macintyre) was
obtained from atcc, manassas, va. lps (minnesota
salmonella) was obtained from sigma. recombinant
human cytokines  xxxg1177xxx  and rgm-csf were obtained
from r&d systems, oakdale, mn and rifn-a f
was obtained from pbl biomedical laboratories, new
brunswick, nj. human tlr-7 (accession no.
af240467) was cloned into the pires expression vector, clontech, palo alto, ca, and human  xxxg2293xxx  (accession no. af259262) was cloned into the pmacskk
expression vector, miltenyi biotec, auburn, ca the
nfjb-luciferase reporter construct was obtained from
clontech.
2.2. transfection and reporter assay
transient transfections were performed as described
with some modiﬁcations [32]. twenty-four hours before
transfection, hek293 cells (crl-1573, american type
culture collection, manassas, va) were adhered to 24well plates (falcon 3047, becton–dickinson, franklin
lakes, nj) at 37 °c, 5%co2 . the cells were transiently
co-transfected with human  xxxg2291xxx  or human  xxxg2293xxx 

76

s.j. gibson et al. / cellular immunology 218 (2002) 74–86

along with nfjb-luc reporter in a 4:1 ratio with
fugene 6 transfection reagent (roche, indianapolis,
in) following manufacturer’s instructions. the plates
were incubated for 24 h following transfection and then
stimulated with various concentrations of resiquimod,
 xxxd2339xxx  or cpg2006. the plates were then incubated an additional 24 h at 37 °c, 5%co2 . the luciferase signal was read in optilux plates (packard,
meriden, ct) using the packard luclite kit. the
luminescence was measured on the packard topcount
nxt (packard).
2.3. pbmc isolation
whole blood anti-coagulated with edta was obtained from healthy volunteers that had provided informed consent prior to donation. pbmc were isolated
by density gradient centrifugation using histopaque
1077 (sigma) as recommended by the manufacturer. the
isolated mononuclear cells were washed twice with
hanks’  xxxd2988xxx  (celox, minneapolis,
mn) and resuspended in crpmi (rpmi 1640, 25 mm
hepes, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm non-essential
amino acids, 1 mm l -glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 5  105 m  xxxd26xxx , and 10% heatinactivated fcs) (celox, oakdale, mn or hyclone,
logan, ut) or x-vivo 20 (biowhittaker, walkersville,
md) medium.
2.4. plasmacytoid dc isolation
human pdc were isolated from pbmc by immunomagnetic bead positive selection according to manufacturer’s recommendations (miltenyi biotech,
auburn, ca). brieﬂy, pbmc were incubated with
pdc-speciﬁc antibodies, bdca-2 or bdca-4, and the
labeled cells were collected with miltenyi ls columns
[33]. the positively selected cells were resuspended in
crpmi or x-vivo 20 medium. human pdc were also
enriched by negative selection from pbmc by depleting
linþ cells. brieﬂy, pbmc isolated from 120 ml whole
blood were resuspended in 1 ml pbs, 1% bsa, and
1 mm edta and incubated with biotin-labeled antibodies speciﬁc for cd3, cd14,  xxxg375xxx , and cd56 and
in some cases  xxxg1206xxx  and  xxxg1208xxx , at a ﬁnal concentration of 100 lg=ml for each antibody. after 15 min
at 6–12 °c, the cells were washed and incubated with
either streptavidin microbeads or anti-biotin microbeads for an additional 15 min at 6–12°c. after washing,
the unlabeled fraction was collected on miltenyi cs
or ls columns and the cells were resuspended in
crpmi or x-vivo 20. the pdc population, hladrþ =cd123hi , was routinely 5–10% of the ﬁnal
preparation as compared to 0.1–0.5% of the starting
pbmc population.

2.5. flow cytometry
intracellular cytokine detection was determined by
flow cytometry. brieﬂy, cells were incubated at
1  106 ml1 in x-vivo 20 medium and stimulated with
an irm for 1 h and then 1 ll brefeldin-a (golgiplug,
bd pharmingen) was added for every ml of cell culture
medium. the cells were then incubated overnight at
37 °c with 5% co2 , not exceeding 12 h. the cells were
washed and resuspended in pharmingen stain buﬀerbsa two times. fc receptors were blocked with immunopure mouse igg, whole molecule (pierce)
(100 ml=106 cells in 100 ll staining buﬀer for 15 min at
4 °c). cells are then washed with staining buﬀer and
stained for surface antigens (10 ll antibody in 50 ll
staining buﬀer for 30 min at 4 °c). cells were then washed and resuspended in cytoﬁx/cytoperm (bd
pharmingen) to ﬁx and permeabilize the cells. after
washing with perm/wash solution, the cells were stained
for intracellular cytokines with anti- xxxg2296xxx  or anti-ifna ﬂuorochrome-labeled antibodies for 30–45 min at
4 °c. finally, the cells were washed, resuspended in
staining buﬀer, and analyzed using a facscan flow
cytometer and cellquest software (becton–dickinson).
evaluation of co-stimulatory markers and ccr7
expression was performed by flow cytometric analysis. brieﬂy, bdca-2 or bdca-4 puriﬁed cells were
treated 24 or 48 h in x-vivo 20 medium with ril-3,
rifn-a or resiquimod. prior to staining, the cells were
washed in pharmingen stain buﬀer-bsa. the cells were
then resuspended in pharmingen stain buﬀer-bsa and
ﬂuorochrome-labeled antibodies speciﬁc to  xxxg396xxx ,
 xxxg398xxx , cd40 or ccr7 were added. after 30 min at 4 °c,
the cell were washed and analyzed by flow cytometry.
2.6. cytokine and chemokine analysis by real-time rtpcr and elisa
cytokine and chemokine expression was evaluated by
real-time rt-pcr. pbmc and bdca-2 puriﬁed pdc
were stimulated in 24-well plates with 3 lm resiquimod.
vehicle control cells were treated with dmso. cells
were incubated for either one or two hours at 37 °c. at
the indicated times the cells were harvested by gently
pipeting the cells into a 1.5 ml eppendorf tube and
centrifuging at 400 rcf for 10 min at 4 °c. the supernatant was removed from the tube and the cells were
lysed with 1 ml trizol (life technologies). rna was
puriﬁed from the samples and treated with dnase i
(life technologies) to remove contaminating genomic
dna, after which the samples were re-extracted with
trizol. final pellets were suspended in 10 ll water;
1 ll was diluted 1:100 and the rna was quantiﬁed by
absorbency (abs260 ).
the rna was reverse-transcribed using superscript
first strand synthesis system for rt-pcr (life tech-

s.j. gibson et al. / cellular immunology 218 (2002) 74–86

nologies). primers for quantitative pcr were generated
using primer express (pe applied biosystems). each
primer set was designed to amplify genomic dna and
tested against a sample of human genomic dna to
verify the amplicon size. the primer sets are shown in
table 1. quantitative pcr was performed on an abi
prism 7700 sequence detector. ampliﬁed products
were detected using sybr green pcr master mix (pe
biosystems). each primer set was tested in triplicate for
each sample. pcr was performed for 35 cycles for 15 s
at 95 °c and 1 min at 60 °c, preceded by a 2 min incubation at 50 °c and 10 min incubation at 95 °c. the
instrument software calculated the number of cycles,
designated ct , required for the accumulated signal to
reach a designated threshold value at least 10 standard
deviations greater than the baseline. the ct value is then
proportional to the number of starting copies of the
target sequence. relative quantitation of gene expression was performed using the ddct method (user bulletin #2, pe applied systems). brieﬂy, the fold change
in expression was calculated relative the expression of
 xxxg861xxx  using the following formula:
fold change ¼ 2ðddct þ ;
where ddct ¼ [ct gene of interest (stimulated sample) ) ct  xxxg861xxx  (stimulated sample)] ) [ct gene of interest (vehicle control) ) ct  xxxg861xxx  (vehicle control)]
[34].
cytokine and chemokine protein levels were measured from tissue culture supernatants or cell extracts by
elisa. human tnf, il-12, il-10 (standard il-10
assay and il-10 ultrasensitive), il-6,  xxxg1172xxx ,  xxxg357xxx ,
and mip-1a elisa kits were obtained from biosource.
human mip-3a elisa kit was obtained from r&d
systems. multi-species ifn-a and ifn-x elisa kits
were obtained from pbl biomedical laboratories.
human  xxxg559xxx , elisa kits were obtained from cell
sciences (norwood, ma). all elisa results are expressed in pg/ml. the limit of reliable detection for all
elisa assays is less than or equal to 40 pg/ml. note:
the multi-species ifn-a elisa assay speciﬁcally detects
all of the human ifn-a subtypes, except ifn-a f

77

(ifna21); the assay also does not detect human ifn-b
or ifn-x.
2.7. statistics
for fig. 2, a paired t test was performed for each
cytokine at each time point (hour 1 and hour 2). the
pbmc and pdc data were log-transformed prior to the
analysis. a p value < 0:05 indicated that the levels of
pbmc were statistically signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the
levels of pdc for that cytokine and time point.
for fig. 3, log-transformed pbmc and pdc-enriched cell data were examined using separate 2-sample t
tests for each cytokine. response values less the 40 pg/
ml (the lowest reliable limit of detection by the elisas) were assigned values of 40 pg/ml for the analysis.
the equality of the 2 group variances was assessed using
the folded form of the f statistic and a 0.05 level of
signiﬁcance for each cytokine. based on the equality of
variances, either a t statistic or an approximate t statistic
(using the satterthwaite approximation of the degrees of
freedom) was calculated. all tests were based on a 0.05
level of signiﬁcance.
for fig. 4a, an analysis of variance (anova), with
percent viable as the response variable and explanatory
variables for donor and treatment, was performed on
the untransformed and arcsin-transformed data separately for 24 and 48 h time points. pairwise comparisons
of active treatment groups to the vehicle group were
performed using the dunnett adjustment to preserve the
overall 0.05 level of signiﬁcance. if there were discrepancies between the two methods, the results from the
arcsin-transformed data were reported.
for fig. 4b, data were examined separately for the
response variables ifn and tnf. this analysis excluded subjects with an observation for only 1 stimuli.
ifn and tnf values less than 40 pg/ml (the lowest
reliable limit of detection by the elisas) were assigned
values of 40 pg/ml for the analysis. treatment diﬀerences were examined using an analysis of variance
(anova) on the log-transformed data, with group
( xxxg1177xxx , ifn-a, resiquimod) as the treatment variable and

hek293 cells were transiently co-transfected with human  xxxg2291xxx  or
human  xxxg2293xxx  and nfjb-luciferase reporter. after 48 h, the cells were
stimulated with various concentrations of resiquimod,  xxxd2339xxx  or
cpg2006. some cells were treated with  xxxg2296xxx  (10 ng/ml) or left
untreated (medium). luciferase activity was measured 48 h post-stimulation and the results are reported as fold-increase relative to medium
control. the rlu values for the medium control and  xxxg2296xxx  control
groups are 8383–9505 and 110,281–224,335, respectively. the data are
representative of three separate experiments.

additionally,  xxxd2339xxx  can also activate nfjb-luciferase through human  xxxg2291xxx  in transiently transfected
hek293 cells, although not as robustly as resiquimod
(table 2). the minimum concentrations of resiquimod
and  xxxd2339xxx  that induce at least a 2-fold increase in
luciferase production are 0.03 and 0:3 lm, respectively.
maximal nfjb activation with resiquimod is achieved
with 10–30 lm, which yields an 18-fold increase in luciferase production. maximal nfjb activation with
 xxxd2339xxx  requires 10–15 lm compound and induces a
5–6-fold increase in luciferase production. human
 xxxg2293xxx  genetic complementation yields cpg2006 responsiveness, but resiquimod and  xxxd2339xxx  do not
activate nfjb through  xxxg2293xxx . these data conﬁrm
previous observations that resiquimod and  xxxd2339xxx 
are  xxxg2291xxx  agonists and further demonstrate that neither
resiquimod nor  xxxd2339xxx  can stimulate nfjb through
 xxxg2293xxx  [28].
3.2. imidazoquinoline-induced type i ifn from human
pbmc requires pdc
since imidazoquinolines have been shown to induce
ifn-a from human pbmc and pdc have been shown
to be the principal ifn-producing cells in the blood in
response to numerous viruses, we determined if pdc are
involved in type i ifn production following  xxxd2339xxx 
and resiquimod treatment. three populations of cells
were evaluated for type i ifn production following
imidazoquinoline stimulation: human pbmc, pdc-depleted pbmc, and pdc-enriched cells. as previously
shown, human pbmc produce ifn-a following  xxxd2339xxx  (0:3–30 lm) or resiquimod (0:03–30 lm) treatment (table 3). peak levels of ifn-a are reached with
 xxxd2339xxx  and resiquimod at 3 lm. hsv-1 treated
pbmc is the positive control and lps the negative
control. pbmc, depleted of pdc, do not produce detectable levels of ifn-a in response to  xxxd2339xxx  or
resiquimod treatment. compared to pbmc, pdc-deﬁcient pbmc also produce lower levels of ifn-a in response to hsv-1 treatment. the ifn-a detected in the
hsv-treated pdc-deﬁcient group is due to one of the
three donors and suggests that the depletion procedure
did not result in complete elimination of pdc from that
one donor. the high variability seen in table 3 is due to
donor variability. in all cases, resiquimod (0:3–30 lm)
and  xxxd2339xxx  (3 lm) induce ifn-a production from
pbmc above the lower limit of detection in all donors
tested.
similar to ifn-a, ifn-x is also produced from imidazoquinoline-stimulated pbmc, but not from pdcdeﬁcient pbmc (table 4). human pbmc produce

human pbmc, pdc-deﬁcient pbmc, and pdc -enriched from human pbmc (pdc-enriched) were cultured with various concentrations of
resiquimod or  xxxd2339xxx . cells were also cultured with hsv-1, lps or were left untreated (medium). after 24 h in culture, cell-free supernatants
were collected and ifn-x was analyzed by elisa. all cells were cultured in serum-free x-vivo 20 medium at 1  106 cells per ml. the data are
presented as means  sd. the detection limit of the ifn-x elisa assay is 40 pg/ml.
b
human pbmc were prepared by density gradient centrifugation (n ¼ 4 separate donors). pdc-deﬁcient pbmc were prepared by depleting pdc
with bdca-4 microbeads (n ¼ 3 separate donors) and pdc-enriched cells were prepared from human pbmc by positive selection with bdca-4
microbeads (n ¼ 4 separate donors).

and lps are also positive and negative controls, respectively, for ifn-x production from these same cultures. similar to ifn-a, ifn-x levels from the
imidazoquinoline-treated groups are not statistically
diﬀerent than the medium control group due to donor
variability, but the trends are similar for both ifn-a
and ifn-x. the data in tables 3 and 4 demonstrate that
pdc are required for the production of these type i
ifns from human pbmc cultures and the data suggest
that both ifn-a and ifn-x are produced by pdc.
to determine if pdc are the principle-ifn-aproducing cells in pbmc in response to imidazoquinolines, pdc were positively selected with immunomagnetic beads (pdc-enriched) and stimulated with
imidazoquinolines. the positively selected cells were at

least 85% pdc ðcd123hi =hla-drþ = xxxg1208xxx  þ as determined by flow cytometry (data not shown). the
imidazoquinoline-treated pdc-enriched cultures produce 2–20 times more ifn-a than similarly treated
pbmc as measured over the entire dose range. resiquimod- and  xxxd2339xxx -induced ifn-a production
above background levels in all four donors at all concentrations tested. similarly, ifn-x was produced from
the positively selected pdc following imidazoquinoline
stimulation. the enriched pdc produced between 3 and
8 times more ifn-x than similarly treated pbmc. also
like ifn-a production, ifn-x levels were above background levels at all concentrations tested. the data in
tables 3 and 4 demonstrate that pdc are required for
the production of type i ifn from resiquimod- and

80

s.j. gibson et al. / cellular immunology 218 (2002) 74–86

 xxxd2339xxx -stimulated human pbmc cultures and enriched populations of pdc produce more type i ifn
than pbmc cultures.
3.3. imidazoquinolines induce type i ifn principally from
pdc
to determine if pdc are the principle ifn-producing
cells in the pbmc cultures, monocytes, b-cells, t-cells,
nk cells, and mdc were depleted with immunomagnetic beads. the remaining pdc-enriched population
was treated in vitro with resiquimod or  xxxd2339xxx .
the cells were sorted into two groups: (r1) cd123hi =
hla-drþ cells and (r2) cells excluding the cd123hi =
hla-drþ cells (fig. 1). the sorted cells were then lysed
and the cytosolic extracts were evaluated for ifn-a
protein. the results demonstrate that imidazoquinolines
induce ifn-a from the cd123hi =hla-drþ cells but

not from the remaining cells in culture. unstimulated
pbmc, sorted in the same manner as imidazoquinolinestimulated pbmc, did not produce detectable levels
of ifn-a after sorting (data not shown). here pdc
are deﬁned as cd123hi =hla-drþ cells from human
pbmc [12,35]. also, it was previously demonstrated
that t-cells, b-cells, nk cells, and cd11cþ blood dc
do not produce type i ifns in response to imidazoquinolines [29]. additionally, puriﬁed cd14þ cells produce negligible amounts of type i ifn in response to
imidazoquinolines (data not shown). therefore, these
data in conjunction with previous studies demonstrate
that the predominant amount of imidazoquinolineinduced ifn-a in pbmc cultures is from the pdc
population.
to determine the number of ifn-a-producing pdc
following imidazoquinoline stimulation, intracellular
ifn-a was measured by flow cytometry (figs. 1b–
d). lin pbmc were treated with various concentrations of resiquimod and the percentage of ifna-producing pdc (cd123hi =hla-drþ ) cells was
determined. resiquimod at 0.3 and 3 lm induces ifn-a
production from 31% and 36% of the cd123hi =
hla-drþ cells, respectively. resiquimod also induces
 xxxg2296xxx  production from the same cells at 0.3 and 3 lm.
the ifn-a antibody is speciﬁc for ifn-a2. previous
data indicate that imidazoquinolines induce the expression of various ifn-a subtypes including  xxxg1137xxx ,
ifna2, ifna5, ifna6, and ifna8 [36]. therefore,

b
fig. 1. cd123hi =hla-drþ but not cd123lo= =hla-drþ cells
produce ifn-a following resiquimod stimulation. (a) pbmc were
enriched for pdc by depleting cd3, cd14,  xxxg375xxx , cd56,  xxxg1206xxx , and
 xxxg1208xxx  expressing cells using immunomagnetic beads. the pdcenriched population was stimulated for 1 h with 3 lm resiquimod or
3 lm  xxxd2339xxx . after 1 h, the cells were treated with brefeldin a for
approximately 10 h. the cells were then labeled with  xxxg1178xxx -pe and
hla-dr-fitc, and sorted into cd123hi =hla-drþ cells (r1) and
the remaining cells which exclude cd123hi =hla-drþ cells (r2). the
sorted populations were lysed and the cytosolic extracts were evaluated
for ifn-a protein by elisa. note: r1 and r2 gated cells from unstimulated pbmc did not produce ifn-a above the limit of detection
(data not shown). (b), (c), and (d) pbmc were enriched for dc by
depleting cd3, cd14,  xxxg375xxx , and cd56 expressing cells using immunomagnetic beads. the dc-enriched population was treated with
resiquimod (0:03–3 lm) or left untreated (0 lm). brefeldin a was added after 1 h in culture and the cells were cultured overnight, not exceeding 12 h post-brefeldin a addition. intracellular  xxxg2296xxx  and ifn-a
were then evaluated from cells triple-stained with  xxxg1178xxx -pe/hladr-percp and either ifn-fitc or tnf-fitc and analyzed by
flow cytometry. (b), (c) cd123hi; hla-drþ cells (r1) and
cd123lo= , hla-drþ cells (r2) were analyzed for the percentage of
cells expressing intracellular cytokine. (c) the quadrants were established using the triple-stained untreated control group. the values in
the right quadrants represent the percentage of cells expressing intracellular ifn-a and  xxxg2296xxx . (b), (d) mean ﬂuorescent intensity (mfi)
values were calculated from cd123hi , hla-drþ cells (r1) and
cd123lo= , hla-drþ cells (r2) cells. the data presented in fig. 1
are from a single experiment and are representative of at least three
similar experiments from three separate donors.

fig. 1 (continued).

the discrepancy between the percentage of cells staining
positive for  xxxg2296xxx  compared to ifn-a may be due to
the inability of the ifn-a antibody to detect all of the
ifn-a subtypes produced by the cells, rather than a true
diﬀerence between the number of pdc expressing the
two cytokines.
the cd123lo= , hla-drþ cells were also analyzed
for ifn-a and  xxxg2296xxx  production. this population of
cells is also cd11cþ (data not shown). the dot-plot in
fig. 1a shows where cd11cþ cells were depleted with a
 xxxg1208xxx -speciﬁc antibody. depletion of cd11cþ cells
results in the elimination of the cd123lo= , hla-drþ
population shown in fig. 1b. these data are consistent
with previously published data using cd11cþ blood dc
[37]. the cd123lo= , hla-drþ cells produce  xxxg2296xxx 
but do not produce ifn-a. positive selection of these
cells and stimulation in vitro with resiquimod resulted in
the production of  xxxg2296xxx  without detectable levels of
ifn-a (data not shown). overall, the data in fig. 1

demonstrate that pdc are the predominant ifn-aproducing cells in the blood in response to imidazoquinolines.
3.4. imidazoquinolines induce pdc to express and secrete
multiple cytokines
plasmacytoid dc produce  xxxg2296xxx , il-8, and other
cytokines, in addition to ifn-a, following activation with
 xxxg390xxx  or cpg oligonucleotides [38,39]. since imidazoquinolines induce type i ifns from pdc, we set forth to
determine if other cytokines and chemokines are produced by pdc in response to imidazoquinolines. we ﬁrst
compared the level of gene expression of various cytokines and chemokines from pbmc and pdc following
resiquimod stimulation. pbmc and pdc were prepared
from three separate donors and stimulated for 1 and 2 h
with resiquimod or dmso (vehicle control). rna was
collected and analyzed for the expression of various

fig. 2. resiquimod-induced cytokine mrna expression from pbmc
and pdc. (a), (b) pbmc (n ¼ 3) and bdca-2- and bdca 4enriched pdc (n ¼ 3) were prepared from six donors and treated with
3 lm resiquimod or vehicle (dmso). after (a) 1 h and (b) 2 h, dnafree rna was prepared for real-time quantitative rt-pcr analysis.
the data are presented as the fold change in mrna expression and
were calculated relative to  xxxg861xxx  mrna expression from each
sample. each data point represents the ratio of mrna from resiquimod-treated cells to mrna from vehicle-treated cells from the same

cytokines and chemokines by real-time rt-pcr (figs.
2a and b). at 1 h post-resiquimod treatment, pbmc
produce 5–10 times more il-12p40,  xxxg1172xxx , il-6, and
 xxxg357xxx  mrna than similarly treated pdc from the same
donors. the relative levels of resiquimod-induced il-10,
 xxxg559xxx , mip-3a, and  xxxg2296xxx  from pbmc and pdc are
similar to each other. at the 2 h time point, relative differences between pbmc and pdc are similar to those
shown at the 1 h time point, except resiquimod-induced
 xxxg559xxx  mrna expression for pdc appears to be approximately 10-fold greater than similarly treated pbmc.
protein production was also measured to conﬁrm the
results in fig. 2. consistent with the mrna data in fig. 2,
resiquimod-treated pbmc secrete higher levels of il12p40,  xxxg1172xxx , and  xxxg357xxx  than similarly treated pdc
(fig. 3). in fact, pdc protein secretion of  xxxg357xxx  and il12p40 were negligible or below the detection limit of the
assay, and  xxxg1172xxx  secretion was present in only one of
the three pdc preparations. the level of il-6 secretion by
resiquimod-treated pdc is substantial, but it is approxi-

pbmc (n ¼ 3) and bdca-2- and bdca-4-enriched pdc (n ¼ 3) were
prepared from six donors. the cells were treated for 24 h with with
3 lm resiquimod or vehicle (dmso) and cell-free supernatants were
analyzed for various cytokines by elisa. each data point on the
graph represents the amount of cytokine produced from one donor.
the groups were normalized by subtracting the vehicle control cytokine levels from the resiquimod-induced cytokine levels. the minimal
level of detection for all assays is approximately 40 pg/ml and is denoted by the arrow on the y-axis. the values at the bottom of the

mately half that of similarly treated pbmc. interestingly,
 xxxg559xxx  secretion from resiquimod-treated pdc is 250-fold
higher than similarly treated pbmc. the cytokine data
demonstrate that resiquimod induces pbmc cultures to
secrete il-12p40,  xxxg1172xxx , il-6,  xxxg559xxx ,  xxxg357xxx , mip-1a,
mip-3a, and  xxxg2296xxx , in addition to type 1 ifns. resiquimod-treated pdc secrete il-6,  xxxg559xxx , mip-1a, and
 xxxg2296xxx . il-6 and mip-1a levels are induced at lower
levels from pdc than from pbmc and  xxxg2296xxx  is produced at approximately the same levels in both cell culture
systems. interestingly,  xxxg559xxx  levels, similar to type i ifn
levels, are greater in pdc than in pbmc cultures. overall,
the data demonstrate that pdc produce multiple cytokines in response to the imidazoquinoline resiquimod.
3.5. imidazoquinolines enhance pdc survival
since stimuli that induce cytokine production from
pdc, such as hsv and  xxxg390xxx , induce survival as well
as cytokine secretion, the eﬀects of resiquimod on pdc
survival were evaluated. plasmacytoid dc were cultured
with either resiquimod,  xxxg1177xxx  or ifn-a for 24 and 48 h at
which time viability was measured by flow cytometry
(fig. 4a). in the absence of exogenous stimuli or

were enriched with bdca-4 immunomagnetic beads. (a) enrichedpdc were treated for 24 or 48 h with  xxxg1177xxx  (1000 u/ml), ifn-a
(1000 u/ml), resiquimod (3 lm) or left untreated (medium). the cells
were stained with  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (pi) and analyzed by flow cytometry. the data are reported as the percentage of viable (pi negative) cells in the total population (means  sd, three separate donors
from three independent experiments). quadrants used to calculate
percentage of viable cells were established using cells not stained with
pi as a baseline for each time point (ssc versus piþ ). isotype controls
showed no change in mfi relative to untreated cells. (b) enrichedpdc were treated for 24 h with  xxxg1177xxx  (1000 u/ml), ifn-a (1000 u/ml),
or resiquimod (3 lm). the levels of  xxxg2296xxx  and ifn-a were determined from the supernatants by elisa. note that the ifn-a elisa
does not detect the exogenously added ifn-af used to stimulate the
cells. the reliable detection limit by the elisas is approximately
40 pg/ml and is denoted by the arrow on the y-axis.  p 6 0:05 compared to the medium control group (a);  p 6 0:05 compared to the

cytokines (medium alone), pdc survival is 60–70% and
30–40% after 24 and 48 h in culture, respectively.
however, resiquimod-treated pdc were 80–90% and
70–80% viable after 24 and 48 h in culture, respectively.
cytokines that have been shown previously to maintain
pdc survival in vitro,  xxxg1177xxx  and ifn-a, also substantially enhance the survival of pdc. in some experiments,
pdc were cultured with gm-csf instead of  xxxg1177xxx  and
pdc mortality was similar to that shown for the medium control group in fig. 4a (data not shown). in
some experiments, cell viability was determined by trypan blue staining and the results were consistent with

fig. 5. resiquimod enhances  xxxg396xxx ,  xxxg398xxx , cd40, and ccr7 expression on pdc. peripheral blood pdc were enriched with bdca-4
immunomagnetic beads. the enriched-pdc were treated for 24 h (a,
c, e, g) or 48 h (b, d, f, h) with  xxxg1177xxx  (1000 u/ml), ifn-a (1000 u/

flow cytometry for  xxxg396xxx  (a, b),  xxxg398xxx  (c, d), cd40 (e, f), and
ccr7 (g, h) expression. the data are reported as the percentage of
viable cells staining positive for  xxxg396xxx ,  xxxg398xxx , cd40, and ccr7
(means  sd, three separate donors from three independent experiments). quadrants used to calculate the percentage of cells expressing
each co-stimulatory marker were established using the ifn-treated
group as a baseline for each time point (ssc versus  xxxg396xxx ,  xxxg398xxx ,
cd40 or ccr7). isotype controls showed no change in mfi relative
to untreated cells.  p 6 0:05 compared to the ifn-a treated group;

s.j. gibson et al. / cellular immunology 218 (2002) 74–86

correlate with the amount of ifn-a or  xxxg2296xxx  produced
by the  xxxg1177xxx -, ifn-a-, and resiquimod-treated pdc (fig.
4b). however, low levels of cytokines may be suﬃcient
to sustain pdc survival in vitro. note that the ifn-a
elisa assay does not detect the exogenously added
ifn-a (ifn-a f or ifna21) species; therefore, the
ifn-a measured in fig. 4b is ifn-a produced by the
cultured pdc.
3.6. imidazoquinolines enhance cell surface expression of
co-stimulatory markers and ccr7 on pdc
we next evaluated the eﬀects of resiquimod on costimulatory marker and ccr7 cell surface expression. it
has previously been shown that the number of pdc that
express  xxxg396xxx  and  xxxg398xxx  increases following culture
with  xxxg1177xxx  [31].  xxxg1177xxx  induces maturation of pdc,
whereas ifn-a does not induce maturation; therefore,
enhanced survival of pdc is not directly proportional to
enhanced maturation [4,31]. here, the percentage of
pdc expressing dc maturation markers was evaluated
following culture with  xxxg1177xxx  or ifn-a or resiquimod
(fig. 5). the data are reported as the percentage of cells
expressing various cell surface markers relative to the
ifn-a treated group; ifn-a sustains viability but has
little eﬀect on dc markers of maturation [4].
resiquimod enhances the expression of  xxxg396xxx ,  xxxg398xxx ,
cd40, and ccr7 on pdc (fig. 5). after 24 h in culture,
the percentage of pdc that express  xxxg396xxx ,  xxxg398xxx , cd40,
and ccr7 following resiquimod treatment is approximately 45, 75, 35, and 85%, respectively. in comparison,
ifn-a treated pdc express 10–20% of these markers at
the same time point. similar to resiquimod treatment  xxxg1177xxx 
treatment up-regulates the expression of  xxxg396xxx ,  xxxg398xxx ,
cd40, and ccr7 by about 50, 30, 15, and 15%, respectively. resiquimod-treated pdc express signiﬁcantly
higher levels of  xxxg398xxx , cd40, and ccr7 as compared to
either the  xxxg1177xxx - or ifn-treated groups 24 h post-treatment. however, the percentage of  xxxg1177xxx -treated pdc that
express  xxxg396xxx  is comparable to the resiquimod-treated
pdc after 24 h in culture. after 48 h in culture, the resiquimod-treated pdc and ifn-treated pdc express
similar levels of  xxxg396xxx ,  xxxg398xxx , cd40, and ccr7 as seen
after 24 h in culture. the  xxxg1177xxx -treated group also shows
similar levels of  xxxg396xxx ,  xxxg398xxx , and ccr7 expression after
48 h, except cd40 levels increase to levels comparable to
those induced by the resiquimod-treated group. the results in fig. 5 show that resiquimod enhances co-stimulatory marker expression and ccr7 expression within
24 h post-pdc stimulation.

4. discussion
the results presented here demonstrate that the
irms  xxxd2339xxx  and resiquimod can activate nfjb

through  xxxg2291xxx  and can induce the production of type i
ifn from pdc; these  xxxg2291xxx  agonists eﬀectively induce
pdc maturation. dc maturation is measured on a
continuum rather than absolute criteria and the continuum of maturation is based on numerous criteria
including cytokine production, co-stimulatory marker
expression, ccr7 expression, and enhanced survival.
therefore, these data demonstrate that imidazoquinoline molecules more fully induce the maturation of pdc
as compared to survival factors like  xxxg1177xxx  and ifn-a
alone. clearly, ifn-a alone is not suﬃcient to enhance
pdc maturation, although ifn-a does suﬃciently
maintain pdc survival without inducing  xxxg2296xxx  or
ifn-a. interestingly,  xxxg1177xxx -treated pdc produce substantial levels of  xxxg2296xxx  and increase the expression of
 xxxg396xxx ,  xxxg398xxx , and cd40, but do not increase the expression of ccr7 or produce ifn-a. in this study, the
degree of pdc maturation correlates with the amount
and the variety of cytokines induced by the stimulus.
although the cause and eﬀect are not shown, it is interesting that ccr7 up-regulation correlates with pdc
type i ifn production.
the immunological eﬀects of imidazoquinolines, including cytokine induction, co-stimulatory marker expression, and b-cell activation, are consistent with
signaling events through either the cd40 pathway or the
tlr/ xxxg1489xxx  pathway [40,41]. imidazoquinolines induce  xxxg2296xxx  and il-12 production, b-cell proliferation,
and co-stimulatory marker expression in cd40- and
traf5-deﬁcient mice (data not shown). the tlr
pathway was shown to be important for imidazoquinoline-induced nfjb activation in  xxxg2291xxx -expressing
hek293 cells. furthermore, the importance of  xxxg2291xxx 
for resiquimod- and  xxxd2339xxx -induced cytokine production has also been demonstrated in  xxxg2291xxx -deﬁcient
mice [28]. the results reported here imply that tlr7mediated, cd40-independent activation is suﬃcient to
drive pdc maturation to the extent of type i ifn
production, co-stimulatory marker up-regulation, and
ccr7 expression.
clearly,  xxxd2339xxx - and resiquimod-induced type i
ifn in peripheral blood cultures requires pdc and pdc
are the predominant cells in the blood that produces
ifn-a following  xxxd2339xxx  or resiquimod stimulation.
the eﬀects of these  xxxg2291xxx  agonists on pdc are broader
than type i ifn induction alone and the eﬀects of these
molecules on pdc activation are similar to those shown
by some cpg oligonucleotides [31,35,38]. the levels of
ifn-a induced by the  xxxg2291xxx  agonists in pdc cultures
are lower than those levels reported for cpg odn-induced ifn-a [30]. there are multiple diﬀerences in the
experimental paradigms used in the two systems. the
experimental system reported by krug et al. consisted of
pdc cultured at 3 million cells per ml in medium
containing serum for 48 h as compared to the methods
used in these studies where 1 million pdc per ml were

s.j. gibson et al. / cellular immunology 218 (2002) 74–86

cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h. therefore, the
diﬀerent ifn-a levels seen in the two systems may not
be due strictly to the diﬀerent tlr agonists themselves.
cpg oligonucleotide-treated pdc produce type i
ifn as well as other cytokines, up-regulate co-stimulatory marker expression, and enhance survival. however,
 xxxd2339xxx  and resiquimod do not stimulate pdc
through  xxxg2293xxx  as shown in table 2. these data are
consistent with previously published data that show
 xxxd2339xxx  and resiquimod induce cytokine production
and dc maturation in  xxxg2293xxx -deﬁcient murine macrophages but not in  xxxg2291xxx -deﬁcient macrophages [28].
functionally, both cpg oligonucleotides and imidazoquinolines similarly enhance th1-mediated immune responses resulting in anti-cancer and anti-viral activity
[20,42–44]. it will be interesting to determine whether
 xxxg2291xxx  activation using imidazoquinolines and  xxxg2293xxx 
activation using cpg oligonucleotides results in the
activation and cytokine production from similar populations of cells. it remains to be determined which proteins directly interact with the imidazoquinoline
molecules resulting in  xxxg2291xxx -mediated signaling.
the variability in the amount of ifn-a produced by
pbmc from various donors has been previously seen
(data not shown). donor-to-donor variability in the
amount of ifn-x produced from pbmc cultures is also
seen in table 4. whether type i ifn was evaluated from
pbmc or from puriﬁed pdc, donor variance was
consistently seen, and therefore does not appear to be
dependent on the method used to enrich for the pdc.
donor variance was also seen when using either bdca2 or bdca-4 to purify pdc, therefore criteria other
than bdca reagent are responsible for donor-to-donor
variability. despite the donor variance for ifn production from human pbmc,  xxxd2339xxx  and resiquimod consistently induced type i ifns at about 3 and
0:3 lm, respectively.
the induction of cytokines other than type i ifn
from resiquimod- and  xxxd2339xxx -treated pdc is not
unexpected based on similar ﬁndings shown with other
pdc stimuli such as to  xxxg390xxx , some cpg oligonucleotides or virus [31,38,39]. in general, imidazoquinolines
induce the production of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines
and chemokines from cells other than pdc in peripheral
blood; pdc produce type i ifn and  xxxg559xxx  following
imidazoquinoline stimulation. thus, pdc activation
following imidazoquinoline stimulation results in the
production of multiple cytokines, not only type i ifn.
clinically,  xxxd2339xxx  and resiquimod are formulated
for topical delivery to hpv and hsv-infected skin, respectively. it is unknown whether pdc are present in
hpv or hsv-infected tissue; however, it is likely that
they are present at some level, since both  xxxd2339xxx  and
resiquimod induce type i ifn predominantly from pdc
rather than other dc populations. because of the critical role type i ifn plays in immune modulation, it is

85

essential to understand which populations of cells are
activated by imidazoquinolines and which populations
of cells produce type i ifn following stimulation with
these  xxxg2291xxx  agonists to understand how these immune
modulators can be best exploited. the imidazoquinoline
molecules have been shown to directly activate a long
list of cell types involved with innate immunity to which
we can now include pdc. in diseases where imidazoquinoline treatment is eﬃcacious, data from both animal models and the clinic indicate that type i ifn is a
critical modulator in disease amelioration [20,45]. these
data provide a mechanistic link between the  xxxg2291xxx  signaling pathway and the production of type i ifn. future work comparing various tlr agonists and their
eﬀects on dc sub-populations will further clarify how
tlr signaling inﬂuences immunity.
