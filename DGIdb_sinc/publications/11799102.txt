 xxxg99xxx  suppression in humans by the orally active
renin inhibitor  xxxd113xxx  ( xxxd113xxx )
comparison with enalapril
juerg nussberger, grégoire wuerzner, chris jensen, hans r. brunner
abstract—renin is the main determinant of angiotensin (ang) ii levels. it, therefore, always appeared desirable to reduce
ang ii levels by direct inhibition of renin. so far, specific renin inhibitors lacked potency and/or oral availability. we
tested the new orally active nonpeptidic renin inhibitor  xxxd113xxx  ( xxxd113xxx , an octanamide with a 50% inhibitory
concentration [ic50] in the low nanomolar range) in 18 healthy volunteers on a constant 100 mmol/d sodium diet using
a double-blind, 3-way crossover protocol. in 3 periods of 8 days, separated by wash-outs of 6 days, each volunteer
received 2 dosage levels of  xxxd113xxx  (low before high; 40 and 80 or 160 and 640 mg/d) and randomized placebo or 20
mg enalapril.  xxxd113xxx  was well tolerated. not surprisingly, blood pressure and heart rate remained unchanged in these
normotensive subjects. there was a dose-dependent decrease in plasma renin activity, ang i, and ang ii following
single doses of  xxxd113xxx  starting with 40 mg. inhibition was still marked and significant after repeated dosing with
maximal decreases in ang ii levels by 89% and 75% on days 1 and 8, respectively, when the highest dose of  xxxd113xxx 
was compared with placebo. at the same time, mean plasma active renin was increased 16- and 34-fold at the highest
dose of  xxxd113xxx . plasma drug levels of  xxxd113xxx  were dose-dependent with maximal concentrations reached between
3 to 6 hours after administration; steady state was reached between 5 and 8 days after multiple dosing. less than 1%
of dose was excreted in the urine. plasma and urinary aldosterone levels were decreased after doses of  xxxd113xxx  ⱖ80
mg and after enalapril.  xxxd113xxx  at 160 and 640 mg enhanced natriuresis on day 1 by ⫹45% and ⫹62%, respectively,
compared with placebo (100%, ie, 87⫾11 mmol/24h) and enalapril (⫹54%); kaliuresis remained unchanged. in
conclusion, the renin inhibitor  xxxd113xxx  dose-dependently decreases ang ii levels in humans following oral
administration. the effect is long-lasting and, at a dose of 160 mg, is equivalent to that of 20 mg enalapril.  xxxd113xxx 
has the potential to become the first orally active renin inhibitor that provides a true alternative to ace-inhibitors and
ang ii receptor antagonists in therapy for hypertension and other cardiovascular and renal diseases. (hypertension.

o

ver the last 3 decades, inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system was successfully used in the treatment
of hypertension and heart failure.1– 4 reduced activation of
the ang ii receptor appears to be a key event to counteract
increased blood pressure and sympathetic tone as well as
harmful cardiovascular hypertrophy and renal lesions.
pharmacological blockade of the ang ii receptors of the
at1-subtype so far turns out to be clinically equally
effective to the less specific ace-inhibition,5 but the
generation of ang ii remains unopposed during at1blockade and leaves the potential for stimulation of other
ang ii receptor subtypes.6 specific inhibitors of renin
reduce ang ii generation,7 but unlike ace-inhibitors they

do not cumulate other peptides like  xxxg2240xxx  or bradykinin and consequently untoward drug effects like cough
and angioedema are not to be expected. several specific
renin inhibitors were synthesized as of the 1970s, but low
efficacy or the lack of oral availability or high cost of
synthesis always prevented renin inhibitors from becoming
successful drugs.8 –22 the present paper introduces the new
orally active nonpeptidic renin inhibitor  xxxd113xxx . the
aim of the study was to investigate in healthy volunteers
the effect of repeated ingestion of four oral doses of
 xxxd113xxx  on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and
on blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma and urinary drug
levels and in comparison to the ace-inhibitor enalapril.

subjects and methods
two groups of 9 healthy male volunteers aged 20 to 34 years
participated in the study. all of the subjects were fully informed of
the goals and potential risks of the investigation and gave written
informed consent. the institutional ethical committee approved the
protocol.
from 5 days before to the study and throughout the 6-week study
period, the volunteers maintained a 100 mmol/d sodium diet.
compliance was verified by measurements of 24-hour urinary
sodium and creatinine excretion. following a randomized, parallelgroup, double-blind 3-way crossover protocol, each volunteer participated in 3 periods of 8 days, separated by wash-outs of 6 days.
each volunteer received either placebo or 20 mg enalapril and 2 oral
dosage levels of  xxxd113xxx  ( xxxd113xxx ) once a day (40 and 80 mg, or
160 and 640 mg).  xxxd113xxx  or placebo (powder in bottles) were
dissolved in 200 ml of water containing bitrex to mask the taste.
enalapril tablets were ingested with 200 ml water.
on the day of the study, the subjects came to the hospital ward at
7:00 am after an overnight fast and were placed in a supine position.
an indwelling cannula (venflon, viggo ag) was inserted into a
forearm vein for blood sampling. the volunteers remained in the
supine position for at least 60 minutes before blood sampling. the
ecg was monitored with an hp model 7380 (hewlett-packard co)
at 0, 4, and 24 hours after dosing on days 1 and 8. upright and
supine blood pressure and heart rate were determined sphygmomanometrically by an automatic blood pressure measuring device
(dinamap sxp, critikon) before every drug intake and in the supine
position at subsequent blood sampling times. on day 1, blood
samples were obtained at times 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 10, and 24 hours after
dosing for the measurement of plasma renin activity (pra),23 active
renin (immunoreactive renin),24 ang i,25 ang ii,26 aldosterone,27 and
drug levels using antiserum and radiolabel of a previously published
assay for  xxxd113xxx .28on day 8, additional drug levels were obtained
at 32, 48, and 96 hours. trough blood samples were taken before
dosing on days 3 and 5. twenty-four– hour urine samples were
collected immediately before and after dosing for the measurement
of drug and aldosterone excretion.29 the volunteers received meals
 xxxd2274xxx  and 11 hours after dosing on collection days. they then went
home and returned, having fasted, to the clinical study facility for the
24-hour measurements and for the subsequent drug intake. all
measurements after the first dosing (day 1) were repeated after the
last dosing (day 8).
 xxxd113xxx  ( xxxd113xxx , speedel pharma) is a potent (ic50 0.6 nmol/l),
low-molecular-weight (mw 610, free base mw 552), nonpeptidic
renin inhibitor that is readily soluble in water and consists of
2(s),4(s),5(s),7 xxxd2589xxx -(2-carbamoyl-2-methylpropyl)-5-amino-4hydroxy-2,7-diisopropyl-8-[4-methoxy-3-(3-methoxypropoxy-)phenyl]-octanamid hemifumarate salt (figure 1). the free base is a
third generation competitive transition state analog and specific
inhibitor of human renin.
determinations of the  xxxd113xxx  in plasma and urine were performed by a direct liquid phase radioimmunoassay using antiserum
and radiolabel of a previously published solid phase assay.28

twenty-five microliters of unknown plasma diluted 1:10 or 25 ␮l of
unknown urine diluted 1:100 in pbs (0.1 n, ph 7.4), 25 ␮l pbs to
compensate for the volume of the standard samples, and 75 ␮l
[125]-iodinated  xxxd113xxx  and 100 ␮l specific rabbit antiserum
against  xxxd113xxx  (diluted 1:500 000 in pbs) were incubated for 24
hours at 4°c. for standard slopes, increasing amounts of  xxxd113xxx 
(0.38 to 192 pg) were dissolved in 25 ␮l pbs, and 25 ␮l diluted
pool plasma/urine without  xxxd113xxx  was added instead of the
unknown plasma/urine. antibody-bound and free  xxxd113xxx  were
separated by the dextran-coated charcoal method.30 the detection
limit was 0.15 ng/ml in plasma and 1.5 ng/ml in urine. recoveries
of various amounts of  xxxd113xxx  added to plasma and urine samples
ranged from 94% to 105%. intra- and interassay coefficients of
variation were consistently below 15%.
results are presented as mean⫾sem. significance of differences
between means of plasma hormones was evaluated by two-way
analysis of variance for comparison of the effect of placebo and that
of the different doses of the drugs. when overall statistical significance was achieved (p⬍0.05) a posteriori testing was used according
to bonferroni.31 the parametric testing was done after logarithmic
transformation of the data to adapt for skewed data. changes in
urinary aldosterone and electrolyte excretion were tested for significance between pretreatment (day ⫺1) and acute (day 1) and
sustained (day 8) drug effects by one-way analysis of variance
followed by bonferroni’s multiple comparison test.

results
the renin inhibitor  xxxd113xxx  ( xxxd113xxx ) was generally well
tolerated. adverse events were similar in all treatment
groups, including placebo and enalapril. orthostatic hypotension and incidents of dizziness were reported on the days of
blood sampling on rising, after volunteers had been lying
down for the first 6 hours of the blood collection periods.
there was a tendency to a higher incidence of dizziness with
the 640 mg  xxxd113xxx  dose. no ecg abnormalities were
observed throughout the study. trough serum potassium was
unchanged. blood pressure and heart rate remained unchanged in all subjects.
the time courses of plasma renin activity, ang i, ang ii,
and active renin are depicted in figures 2a to 2d. table 1
presents means⫾sem values for plasma hormones including
aldosterone and drug levels together with statistical significance levels of differences between drug and placebo effects.
 xxxd113xxx  significantly inhibited the renin-angiotensin system in a dose-dependent manner. on day 1, ang ii was
maximally reduced within one hour of  xxxd113xxx  administration, whereas maximal reduction was reached with enalapril
only after 6 hours. the diurnal rhythm of ang ii plasma
levels is shown on the placebo curve. ang ii levels were
significantly decreased up to 6 hours by  xxxd113xxx  at all doses
except the 40-mg dose on day 1. similar observations were
made on day 8: there was an inhibition of ang ii synthesis
for up to 6 hours. the percent inhibition versus baseline of
ang ii by  xxxd113xxx  at doses of 160 mg (56%) or 640 mg
(76%) were similar to or greater than inhibition by enalapril
20 mg (57%).
pra and ang i inhibition paralleled the changes in ang ii
following  xxxd113xxx . pra and ang i were increased by
enalapril ⬎15-fold on day 1 and even further on day 8
(figures 2a and 2b).
 xxxd113xxx  increased active renin in a dose-dependent manner up to 20-fold higher than placebo following administration of a 640-mg dose. enalapril increased active renin

approximately 10-fold compared with placebo; the values
were similar to those obtained with 160 mg of  xxxd113xxx .
active renin was further increased on day 8 in all dose
groups, including enalapril.
plasma aldosterone was decreased 3 hours postdrug on
day 1 with 80, 160, and 640 mg  xxxd113xxx  and with enalapril,
and this effect lasted up to 6 hours with enalapril and up to 24
hours following 640 mg  xxxd113xxx . the lower doses of
 xxxd113xxx  and enalapril did not significantly decrease plasma
aldosterone at 24 hours (table 1). the 40-mg dose of
 xxxd113xxx  had no effect on plasma aldosterone. on day 8,
plasma aldosterone was no longer significantly reduced
(table 1). mean urinary aldosterone excretion was decreased
up to 56% with  xxxd113xxx , particularly on day 1, and
remained 31% inhibited on day 8 (figure 3 and table 2). the
40 mg  xxxd113xxx  reduced aldosterone excretion only after
repeated dosing, but all the higher doses of the renin inhibitor
decreased aldosterone excretion already on day 1, and this
effect was still apparent but sometimes attenuated (80 mg,
640 mg) on day 8. comparable decreases in mean aldosterone excretion were observed with enalapril although they did
not reach significance (table 2).
plasma concentrations of  xxxd113xxx  were measured in all
subjects at all doses of  xxxd113xxx  (figure 4a). there was a
dose-dependent increase in drug levels, with maximal concentrations reached 3 to 6 hours after administration of 80 to
640 mg of  xxxd113xxx . plasma levels of 0.26⫾0.05 ng/ml were
detected after 24 hours at the lowest dose (40 mg). steady
state was reached between 5 and 8 days after multiple dosing.
mostly, less than 1% of dose was excreted in the urine in a
dose-dependent manner (figure 4b).
urinary sodium and potassium excretion, as well as urinary
aldosterone and  xxxd113xxx  excretion, are summarized in table
2. on day 1, a significant natriuretic effect was observed after
administration of 640 mg  xxxd113xxx  (⫹91%) and after 20 mg
enalapril (⫹54%). a trend to natriuresis was already present
with  xxxd113xxx  at smaller doses, but not with placebo (table
2). on day 8, this enhancement of natriuresis had disappeared, and the volunteers excreted sodium according to the
dietary intake. potassium excretion remained unchanged
throughout the study. urinary excretion of  xxxd113xxx  was 0.1
to 1.1% of the administered dose at steady state. traces of
 xxxd113xxx  were found in the urine of several volunteers on
enalapril or placebo who had received  xxxd113xxx  in a previous
session. this indicates that the wash-out period of 6 days may
not have been adequate for  xxxd113xxx ’s half-life of 24 hours,
particularly following the higher doses.

discussion
the new specific renin inhibitor  xxxd113xxx  ( xxxd113xxx ), unlike
any of the previous renin inhibitors described over the last 3
decades, induces in human subjects, after oral administration,

( xxxd113xxx ) and by enalapril. b, the ordinate is interrupted and
extended by a logarithmic scale to enable plotting of the very
high  xxxg99xxx  concentrations.

figure 3. urinary aldosterone excretion in 9 healthy men after
acute (day 1) and sustained (day 8) inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by the renin inhibitor  xxxd113xxx 
( xxxd113xxx ) and by enalapril.

a significant and sustained decrease in plasma renin activity,
ang i and ang ii plasma levels. the concentration of active
renin in plasma clearly increased dose-dependently in response to the fall in ang ii levels and, hence, as a consequence of the reduced feed-back restriction of renal renin
secretion. the decreases in plasma and urinary aldosterone
levels, and an increased natriuresis, further document the
efficient blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system.
these favorable properties of  xxxd113xxx  may be due to
several causes. first, the high affinity of the compound to
human renin (ic50 in the low nanomolar range, data not
shown), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the production
of ang ii in man, places  xxxd113xxx  among the most potent of
such anti-ang ii molecules. second,  xxxd113xxx  is the first
specific renin inhibitor to be shown to elicit a marked and
sustained blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in man
after oral administration. third,  xxxd113xxx  has a plasma
half-life of approximately 24 hours, which appears to be ideal
for once-a-day dosing. using michaelis-menten kinetics, we
have previously calculated for the renin inhibitor  xxxd3095xxx 
that 0.05 to 0.5 ␮mol/l plasma drug concentrations would be
needed for significant ang ii suppression, and we doubted
that  xxxd3095xxx  could become a useful cardiovascular drug.21
the same calculations allow a more optimistic prognosis for
 xxxd113xxx . given the high affinity of  xxxd113xxx  for renin, the
improved bioavailability, and early results in patients,32 one
might indeed predict effective antihypertensive properties of
this new renin inhibitor.
the success of ace-inhibitors and ang ii receptor antagonists in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure is
mainly attributed to an anti-ang ii effect of these drugs.2–5
renin inhibitors should provide similar therapeutic effects,
but, unlike ace-inhibitors, side-effects like cough or angioedemas33 should be unlikely. in addition, unlike ang ii
receptor antagonists, renin inhibitors should chronically decrease, rather than increase, circulating ang ii levels. therefore, the overstimulation of unblocked ang ii receptors of
any subtype should become irrelevant. thus, whereas ang ii

inhibitor  xxxd113xxx  and urinary excretion (b) of  xxxd113xxx  ( xxxd113xxx )
in 9 healthy men after acute (day 1) and sustained (day 8) inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by the renin
inhibitor  xxxd113xxx  ( xxxd113xxx ) and by enalapril.

receptor blockers increase circulating ang i and ii and, hence,
concentrations of the prothrombotic plasminogen activator
inhibitor 1 (pai-1), the renin inhibitors can be expected to
decrease pai-1, because they decrease ang levels like
ace-inhibitors.34,35
presently, many authors advocate the coadministration of
small doses of ace-inhibitors and  xxxg99xxx  receptor
antagonists to achieve greater blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. this has the obvious disadvantage that it
introduces the side effects inherent to the ace-inhibitors
used in this therapy. in the future, the combination of a renin
inhibitor with an  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonist—if such a
combination is at all needed— could be much more appropriate because this combination can be expected to be devoid of
any major side effects.
the present study showed significant renin blocking effects of even the lowest dose of  xxxd113xxx  (40 mg/d). during
placebo treatment, a clear circadian activity pattern of renin,
ang i, and ang ii, as well as aldosterone, could be observed
with lower activity in the evening (10 hours post-drug). the
first sign of renin inhibition appears to be a flattening of the
meridian rise in plasma renin activity and ang i and ang ii
concentrations. with higher doses of the renin inhibitor, the

blockade became stronger and lasted longer. the comparison
to a daily dose of 20 mg enalapril indicated nearly equipotent
reduction at doses of ⱖ160 mg of  xxxd113xxx  in ang ii plasma
levels, in plasma and urinary aldosterone and in the reactive
rise in plasma active renin levels. interestingly, the decrease
in urinary aldosterone excretion was significant with all doses
of  xxxd113xxx . the long half-life of the renin inhibitor may
contribute to reduced aldosterone excretion. plasma potassium was monitored at the end of each session of hormone
profiling and was found unchanged. the effect of the enalapril may be slightly overestimated on day 1 because of the
possible carryover of  xxxd113xxx  from previous sessions. however, this carryover should not have affected the actions of
enalapril on day 8 of dosing, although the variation of results
increased because of the findings in two subjects.
blood pressure and heart rate were not significantly
changed, either by  xxxd113xxx  or by enalapril. this is not
surprising in healthy men on a constant 100 mmol/d sodium
diet and in keeping with earlier observations. the urinary
sodium excretion during placebo and before drug treatment
(day ⫺1) confirmed a rather good adherence of the volunteers to the diet. a small natriuretic effect of  xxxd113xxx  and of
enalapril could be demonstrated together with a slight decrease in aldosterone concentrations on the first day of
inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. these
effects were no longer significant with sustained drug administration (day 8).  xxxd113xxx  was generally well tolerated.
episodes of orthostatic hypotension or dizziness were comparable in all treatment groups, including the enalapril group.
in conclusion, the new specific renin inhibitor  xxxd113xxx 
( xxxd113xxx ) dose-dependently decreases ang ii concentrations
in human subjects after oral administration. the effect is
long-lasting and, at ⱖ160 mg doses, equivalent to that of 20
mg enalapril.  xxxd113xxx  has the potential to become the first
renin inhibitor that provides a true alternative to ace-inhibitors and ang ii receptor antagonists in therapy for hypertension and other cardiovascular and renal diseases.
