1 the  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitor  xxxd168xxx  is used in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia.
although most anticancer drugs are believed not to cause acquired long qt syndrome (lqts),
concerns have been raised by reports of qt interval prolongation, ventricular fibrillation and death
associated with  xxxd168xxx  treatment. since blockade of cardiac human ether-a-go-go-related gene
(herg) potassium currents is an important cause of acquired lqts, we investigated the acute effects
of  xxxd168xxx  on cloned herg channels to determine the electrophysiological basis for its
proarrhythmic potential.
2 herg channels were heterologously expressed in human hek 293 cells and xenopus laevis
oocytes, and the respective potassium currents were recorded using patch-clamp and twomicroelectrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology.
3  xxxd168xxx  blocked herg currents in hek 293 cells and xenopus oocytes in a concentrationdependent manner, with ic50 values of 209.4 nm and 2.0 mm, respectively.
4 herg channels were primarily blocked in the open and inactivated states, and no additional
voltage dependence was observed.  xxxd168xxx  caused a negative shift in the voltage dependence of
both activation (7.6 mv) and inactivation (7.6 mv). herg current block by  xxxd168xxx  was not
frequency dependent.
5 the s6 domain mutations y652a and f656a attenuated (y652a) or abolished (f656a, y652a/
f656a) herg current blockade, indicating that  xxxd168xxx  binding requires a common drug receptor
within the pore-s6 region.
6 in conclusion, these data demonstrate that the anticancer drug  xxxd168xxx  is an antagonist of
cloned herg potassium channels, providing a molecular mechanism for the previously reported qtc
interval prolongation during clinical administration of  xxxd168xxx .

introduction
 xxxd168xxx  ( xxxd168xxx ) is a synthetic aminoacridine that is used
in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (aml), for
example, as part of the induction regimen (kantarjian et al.,
1996; arnaout et al., 2000; rowe, 2000). its therapeutic
effectiveness has been attributed to intercalation of the
compound into dna and to inhibition of dna topoisomerase
ii (jehn & heinemann, 1991). however, concerns have been
raised by reports on qt interval prolongation, ventricular

arrhythmia and death associated with  xxxd168xxx  application
(van hoff et al., 1980; mclaughlin et al., 1983; schwartz et al.,
1984; shinar & hasin, 1984; griffin et al., 1985; winton et al.,
1985; dhaliwal et al., 1986; weiss et al., 1986; seymour, 1993),
suggesting an effect of  xxxd168xxx  on cardiac repolarization.
in human cardiomyocytes, repolarization is mainly carried
by the rapidly and slowly activating components of the delayed
rectifier potassium current, ikr and iks (sanguinetti &
jurkiewicz, 1990). the human ether-a-go-go-related gene
(herg) (sanguinetti et al., 1995) encodes the a-subunit
underlying ikr, and mutations in herg account for chromosome 7-linked inherited long qt syndrome ( xxxg1268xxx -2) (viskin,
1999). patients diagnosed with  xxxg1268xxx -2 may present prolonged
qt intervals in the surface electrocardiogram and have an

increased risk for ventricular ‘torsade de pointes’ arrhythmias
and sudden cardiac death. pharmacological inhibition of
herg potassium channels is a property of class iii
antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone (kiehn et al.,
1999), and of a multitude of non-antiarrhythmic compounds
(for a review, see redfern et al., 2003). block of ikr causes
lengthening of the cardiac action potential, which produces a
beneficial class iii antiarrhythmic effect. on the other hand,
excessive action potential prolongation may lead to acquired
long qt syndrome and life-threatening ‘torsade de pointes’
arrhythmias (napolitano et al., 1994).
the aim of the present study was to determine the
electrophysiological basis of the qtc interval prolongation
associated with  xxxd168xxx  treatment. acute effects of  xxxd168xxx  on herg channels expressed heterologously in xenopus
oocytes and human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells were
investigated, revealing detailed insights into the biophysical
mechanism of  xxxd168xxx  block of herg currents.

methods
molecular biology
the herg cdna clone was generously donated by m.t.
keating. the preparation of the herg y652a and herg
f656a clones has been published previously (scholz et al.,
2003). to generate the herg y652a/f656a clone, the
respective single mutations were introduced simultaneously
into the herg wild-type cdna template by site-directed
mutagenesis using the quikchange kit (stratagene, la jolla,
u.s.a.) and synthetic mutant oligonucleotide primers, as
described earlier in detail (scholz et al., 2003). procedures for
in vitro transcription and oocyte injection were performed as
published previously (kiehn et al., 1999). briefly, herg wild
type (warmke and ganetzky, 1994), herg y652a, herg
f656a and herg y652a/f656a crnas were prepared with
the mmessage mmachine kit (ambion, austin, u.s.a.)
using sp6 rna polymerase after linearization with ecori
(roche diagnostics, mannheim, germany). stage v–vi
defolliculated xenopus oocytes were injected with 46 nl of
crna per oocyte.
the cdna encoding the herg  xxxg1232xxx  cloned
in pcdna3 was stably transfected into the human embryonic
kidney cell line hek 293 as described previously (thomas
et al., 2001). cells were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle
medium/nutrient mixture f-12 (d-mem/f12, gibco brl,
rockville, u.s.a.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (fbs, gibco brl), 100 u/ml1  xxxd2871xxx  sodium,
100 mg ml1 streptomycin sulfate and 500 mg ml1  xxxd2191xxx 
( xxxg418xxx , gibco brl) in an atmosphere of 95% humidified air
and 5% co2 at 371c.
the investigation conforms to the guide for the care and
use of laboratory animals published by the us national
institute of health (nih publication no. 85-23, revised 1996).
all experiments followed the european community guidelines
for the use of experimental animals.

electrophysiology
two-microelectrode voltage-clamp recordings from xenopus
laevis oocytes were carried out as published previously
british journal of pharmacology vol 142 (3)

 xxxd168xxx  blocks herg channels

(thomas et al., 2001). in brief, recordings were performed
using a warner oc-725a amplifier (warner instruments,
hamden, u.s.a.) and pclamp software (axon instruments,
foster city, u.s.a.) for data acquisition and analysis.
microelectrodes had tip resistances ranging from 1 to 5 mo.
the recording chamber was continually perfused. herg
current recordings from hek 293 cells were performed by use
of the whole-cell patch clamp configuration (hamill et al.,
1981) as previously reported (thomas et al., 2001). all
experiments were carried out at room temperature (22–
251c), and no leak subtraction was done during the experiments.

solutions and drug administration
voltage-clamp measurements of xenopus oocytes were performed in a solution containing (in mm): 5 kcl, 100 nacl, 1.5.
cacl2, 2 mgcl2 and 10 hepes (ph adjusted to 7.4 with
naoh). current and voltage electrodes were filled with 3 m
kcl solution. for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from
hek 293 cells, electrodes were filled with the following
solution (in mm): 130 k-aspartate, 5.0 mgcl2, 5 egta, 4
atp, 10 hepes (ph adjusted to 7.2 with koh). the external
solution for these experiments contained (in mm): 137 nacl,
4.0 kcl, 1.0 mgcl2, 1.8 cacl2, 10 hepes, 10 glucose (ph
adjusted to 7.4 with naoh).  xxxd168xxx  (sigma) was prepared
as 10 mm stock solution in dmso and stored at 201c. on
the day of experiments, aliquots of the stock solution were
diluted to the desired concentrations with the bath solution.
herg current amplitudes (recorded from xenopus oocytes
using the protocol described in figure 1a) were not significantly altered upon application of 1% dmso (v v1;
maximum bath concentration) for 20 min (data not shown).
in addition, dmso did not affect herg channel currents
recorded from hek 293 cells at concentrations up to 0.3%
(maximum bath concentration in this study: 0.1% dmso)
(data not shown).

data analysis and statistics
concentration–response relationships for drug-induced block
were fit with a hill equation of the following form: idrug/
icontrol ¼ 1/[1 þ (d/ic50)n], where i indicates current, d is the
drug concentration, n is the hill coefficient, and ic50 is the
concentration necessary for 50% block. activation curves
were fit with a single-power boltzmann distribution of the
form itail ¼ itail:max =½1 þ eðv1=2 vþ=k , where v is the test pulse
potential v1/2 is the half-maximal activation potential, and k is
the slope of the activation curve. inactivation curves were fit to
the
following
single-power
boltzmann
equation:
i ¼ imax =½1 þ eðvv1=2 þ=k .
data are expressed as mean 7s.e.m. we used paired and
unpaired student’s t-tests (two-tailed tests) to compare the
statistical significance of the results: po0.05 was considered
statistically significant. multiple comparisons were performed
using one-way anova. if the hypothesis of equal means
could be rejected at the 0.05 level, pairwise comparisons of
groups were made and the probability values were adjusted for
multiple comparisons using the bonferroni correction.

 xxxd168xxx  blocks herg currents
 xxxd168xxx  blocked herg potassium channels expressed in
xenopus laevis oocytes in a concentration-dependent manner,
as displayed in figure 1. currents were elicited by a 2 s
depolarizing step to þ 20 mv, followed by a repolarizing step
to 40 mv for 1.6 s to produce large, slowly decaying outward
tail currents which are a characteristic of herg potassium
channels (sanguinetti et al., 1995). the holding potential was
80 mv in all experiments performed in this study, unless
indicated otherwise. pulses were applied at a frequency of
0.1 hz during superfusion with the drug solution for 15 min.
after the monitoring period, the degree of block was
determined (figure 1a). to study the concentration dependence of herg current block by  xxxd168xxx , herg peak tail
currents in the presence of the drug were normalized to the
respective control values and plotted as relative current
amplitudes in figure 1b (n ¼ 6–7 oocytes were investigated at
each concentration). the half-maximal inhibition concentration (ic50) for block of tail currents yielded 2.070.1 mm with a
hill coefficient nh of 1.1470.05. the time course of block is
shown in figure 1c (n ¼ 3). after a control period of 20 min,
herg channel block by 10 mm  xxxd168xxx  reached steady-state
conditions after 10–15 min. upon washout (20 min), the
blocking effects of  xxxd168xxx  on herg were partially
reversible.

it has been demonstrated that the aromatic residues y652 and
f656 located in the s6 domain are key determinants of drug
binding to herg channels (mitcheson et al., 2000a). thus,
the effects of  xxxd168xxx  on mutant herg y652a, herg
f656a and herg y652a/f656a channels were investigated
to assess the significance of these amino-acid residues in
 xxxd168xxx  blockade of herg currents. voltage protocols
were applied as described above (figure 1a) to record currents
under control conditions and after application of 10 mm
 xxxd168xxx , reducing herg wild-type currents to
20.072.5% (n ¼ 6; figure 1b). as illustrated in figure 1d,
the inhibitory effect of  xxxd168xxx  was significantly attenuated
(herg y652a) or completely abolished (herg f656a,
herg y652a/f656a) by replacement of aromatic channel
pore residues y652 and/or f656 with alanine residues. mean
relative currents measured after  xxxd168xxx  application yielded
60.574.6% (y652a; n ¼ 8), 103.776.0% (f656a; n ¼ 8) and
105.374.0% (y652a/f656a; n ¼ 8) of control currents,
respectively (figure 1d).

conditions. depolarizing pulses were applied for 2 s to voltages
between –80 and þ 70 mv in 10 mv increments (0.2 hz), and
tail currents were recorded during a constant repolarizing step
to –60 mv for 1.6 s. families of current traces from one cell
are shown for control conditions and after exposure to 3 mm
 xxxd168xxx  (15 min) in figure 2a and b. the currents activated
at potentials greater than 60 mv, reached a peak at 0 mv and
then decreased at more positive potentials due to inactivation
(sanguinetti et al., 1995), giving the i–v relationship its typical
bell-shaped appearance (figure 2c and d). figure 2e and f
displays peak tail currents as a function of the preceding test
pulse potential, resulting in activation curves. herg currents
at the end of the test pulse to 0 mv were reduced by
38.873.0%, and peak tail currents were blocked by
44.371.7% (n ¼ 8). the half-maximal activation voltage v1/2
was shifted by 7.670.8 from 12.870.6 mv under control
conditions to 20.470.9 mv after  xxxd168xxx  incubation
(n ¼ 8). this difference was statistically significant.

effects of  xxxd168xxx  on herg channel inactivation
the effects of  xxxd168xxx  on herg current inactivation were
investigated using two different approaches. first, it was tested
whether the time constant of inactivation was affected by the
drug. pulses were applied to 40 mv for 900 ms where channels
are partially open but predominantly inactivated. a brief
repolarization to –100 mv for 16 ms caused rapid recovery
from inactivation without marked deactivation. during a
second depolarizing pulse (150 ms) to different voltages

a

ranging from –40 to 40 mv (increment 20 mv), large, rapidly
inactivating currents were produced. inactivating currents
were recorded in the absence of the drug (figure 3a) and after
equilibration of block with 3 mm  xxxd168xxx  (figure 3b) by
current monitoring for 15 min as described above. since the
inactivation time constant depends on the current amplitude, a
set of control cells and matching oocytes after  xxxd168xxx 
application with similar mean current amplitudes at the end of
the conditioning prepulse (0.4970.08 versus 0.5070.08 ma)
were compared. single exponential fits to the large inactivating
currents yielded the time constants of inactivation at
different voltages. in these experiments, no changes in the
time constants for herg channel inactivation were
observed (figure 3c; n ¼ 10 oocytes were analyzed in each
series).
to measure steady-state inactivation relationships, channels
were inactivated at a holding potential of 20 mv, before being
recovered from inactivation at various potentials from –120 to
30 mv (increment 10 mv) for 20 ms. finally, the resulting peak
outward currents at constant 20 mv as a measure of steadystate inactivation were recorded. after having obtained the
control measurements (figure 3d), we applied 3 mm  xxxd168xxx 
to the oocytes. the holding potential was –80 mv during the
current monitoring period of 15 min to avoid destruction of
the cell, as it would occur when holding the cell at 20 mv. one
typical recording in the presence of the drug is displayed in
figure 3e. the inactivating outward current amplitude
measured at 20 mv was normalized and plotted against the
test pulse potential, giving the steady-state inactivation curve

figure 3 effects of  xxxd168xxx  on herg current inactivation. the inactivation time constant was assessed from the third step of
the following voltage protocol: currents were activated by 900-ms pulses to 40 mv, followed by a brief repolarization to –100 mv
(16 ms). variable voltage steps ranging from –40 to 40 mv (150 ms; increment 20 mv) were consecutively applied to evoke
inactivating currents (a, b). current measurements recorded from different representative oocytes under control conditions (a) and
after incubation with 3 mm  xxxd168xxx  (b) are displayed. (c) depicts mean inactivation time constants obtained from singleexponential fits to the inactivating current traces (n ¼ 10). panels d and e show representative single measurements of the steadystate inactivation at constant 20 mv after various potentials from –120 to 30 mv (increment 10 mv). note that, for clarity, not all
original current traces are displayed. the normalized mean inactivating current amplitudes at 20 mv are shown in panel f, giving
steady-state inactivation curves. the mean half-maximal inactivation voltage was shifted by 7.6 mv towards more negative
potentials (n ¼ 6) (see text for voltage protocols).

(figure 3f). mean values for the half-maximal inactivation
voltage yielded 62.971.8 mv for control and 70.571.5 mv
for  xxxd168xxx  measurements (n ¼ 6), displaying a relative shift
of 7.670.8 mv. a study limitation derives from the fact that
the current amplitudes at 120 mv were set as maximum
values. however, since we applied the same analysis under
control conditions and in the presence of  xxxd168xxx , we
suggest that at least the relative shift of the half-maximal
inactivation voltage may be interpreted as drug-induced effect
on herg inactivation.

the biophysical mechanism of herg current inhibition
by  xxxd168xxx 
to investigate whether the channel is blocked in the closed or
activated (i.e. open and/or inactivated) state, we activated
currents using a protocol with a single depolarizing step to
0 mv for 7.5 s. after having obtained the control measurement,
we allowed 10 mm of the drug to wash in for 15 min while
holding the channels in the closed state at –80 mv. then,
measurements with  xxxd168xxx  were performed (figure 4a).
the degree of inhibition (i.e. (1current in the presence of
 xxxd168xxx /control current)  100) is displayed in figure 4b.
analysis of the test pulse after  xxxd168xxx  application revealed
a time-dependent increase of block to 80% at 1250 ms in this

representative cell (figure 4b), which is consistent with block
of activated herg potassium channels. however, some
degree of closed state block cannot be ruled out by this
protocol, although it is rather unlikely since the initial portion
of the current trace in the presence of the drug appears to be
the same as the current trace recorded under control
conditions. in this series of experiments, 10 mm  xxxd168xxx 
reduced herg outward currents at the end of the 0 mv pulse
by 77.572.3% (n ¼ 6).
to address the question whether herg channels are also
blocked by  xxxd168xxx  in the inactivated state, a long test pulse
to þ 80 mv (4 s) was applied to inactivate the channels,
followed by a second voltage step (0 mv, 3.5 s) to open herg
channels (n ¼ 6). typical current traces under control conditions and after application of 10 mm  xxxd168xxx  for 15 min while
holding the cell at 80 mv are displayed in figure 4c.
figure 4d depicts the normalized relative block upon channel
opening during the second voltage pulse (0 mv), illustrating
that pronounced inhibition of herg channels had already
been obtained during the preceding inactivating þ 80 mv
pulse, and no additional time-dependent block of open

in summary, it is concluded from these experiments that
 xxxd168xxx  inhibits herg channels predominantly in the open
and inactivated state, with inhibition of closed channels being
rather unlikely.

voltage dependence of herg channel block by  xxxd168xxx 
to assess the voltage dependence of herg channel block, we
applied the following methodical approach. since unblocking
was slow, only one experiment at each potential could be
carried out with one individual oocyte. currents were elicited
by 27 s depolarizing pulses ranging from –40 to 80 mv
(figure 5a), and peak inward tail currents were measured
during a second step to –100 mv (400 ms). first, control
currents were recorded. then the oocyte was superfused with
the drug solution (3 mm  xxxd168xxx ) while holding the cell at
–80 mv for 15 min where herg channels are in the closed
state. after this, measurements at the test pulse potential were
performed. relative inhibition of peak tail currents (plotted as
a function of the preceding test pulse potential in figure 5a)
was not significantly different among the voltage steps applied
(40 mv: 47.875.2%; 0 mv: 39.774.5%; 40 mv: 44.373.9%;
80 mv: 36.973.2%; n ¼ 79 cells were studied at each
potential). thus,  xxxd168xxx  reduced herg currents in a
voltage-independent manner.
british journal of pharmacology vol 142 (3)

lack of frequency dependence of  xxxd168xxx  block
the frequency dependence of block was investigated in the
following set of experiments. herg potassium channels were
rapidly activated by a depolarizing step to 20 mv for 300 ms,
followed by a repolarizing step to 40 mv (300 ms) to elicit
outward tail currents. pulses were applied at intervals of 1 or
10 s under control conditions and in the presence of 3 mm
 xxxd168xxx , with each cell studied only at one stimulation rate.
six oocytes were used at each rate. the development of current
reduction was plotted versus time (figure 5b). the resulting
level of steady-state block is a measure of the frequency
dependence of block. there were no significant changes in the
amount of steady-state block at both rates (35.175.6% (1 hz)
versus 35.372.7% (0.1 hz), respectively). thus, block was not
frequency dependent.

 xxxd168xxx  blocks herg channels in a human cell line
to demonstrate  xxxd168xxx  block of herg in human cells, we
expressed herg potassium channels heterologously in human
embryonic kidney (hek 293) cells. channels were activated by
a 2 s depolarization to þ 20 mv, and outward tail currents were
recorded during a step to –50 mv for 2 s (figure 6a). during the
wash-in of the drug, we applied the protocol as described above
(frequency 0.1 hz), until a steady-state block was maintained
for at least 30 s. herg currents were blocked by  xxxd168xxx  in a
concentration-dependant manner. the ic50 value for  xxxd168xxx

discussion
acute effects of  xxxd168xxx  on herg currents
herg potassium channels are blocked by the anticancer drug
 xxxd168xxx , a finding in line with qtc prolongation observed
among aml patients treated with this drug. to our knowledge,  xxxd168xxx  represents the first antineoplastic compound
that inhibits herg currents. blockade of herg channels
expressed in xenopus laevis oocytes displayed an ic50 value of
2.0 mm, while herg currents in hek 293 cells were inhibited
with an ic50 value of 209.4 nm. this 9.6-fold difference
corresponds well to previous reports comparing drug block

of herg currents in different expression systems. owing to
the specific properties of the xenopus oocyte expression system
(e.g. the vitelline membrane and the yolk) that reduce the
actual concentration of drugs at the cell membrane, higher
concentrations of drugs are necessary when applied to whole
oocytes under in vitro conditions. in general, ic50 values for
herg channel block are approximately 10–20-fold higher
when the drug is applied to the extracellular surface of xenopus
oocytes compared to whole-cell patch-clamp experiments using
mammalian cells (thomas et al., 2001; 2003a, b). therapeutic
 xxxd168xxx  plasma concentrations in humans have been
reported to be 5–18 mm (jurlina et al., 1985; linssen et al.,
1993), with approximately 97% of the drug being bound to
plasma proteins (paxton et al., 1986). thus, it is reasonable to
assume that herg current inhibition by  xxxd168xxx  is
physiologically relevant.
it has been suggested that co-assembly of the regulatory bsubunit mirp1 with herg reconstitutes native ikr (abbott

weerapura et al. (2002) in detail, revealing that co-expression
of herg with wild-type mirp1 (in contrast to long qt
syndrome-linked mutant mirp1; abbott et al., 1999) does
not alter its sensitivity to herg-blocking drugs. experiments
using mirp1 were not performed in this study since it is still
controversial whether it is part of native ikr channels.

the biophysical mechanism of herg current reduction
by  xxxd168xxx 
in the present study, the heterologous xenopus oocyte
expression system was used to determine the biophysical
mechanism of herg current inhibition by  xxxd168xxx  in
detail. one important finding of this study is that  xxxd168xxx 
blocks herg channels predominantly in the open and
inactivated state, as demonstrated using specially designed
voltage protocols to discriminate between the different states.
but still, the voltage protocols do not completely exclude
partial contamination by channel states not primarily assessed
by the respective protocol. in particular, recovery from
inactivation and deactivation may contribute to the currents
measured in figure 3. block at negative membrane potentials
(i.e. 40 mv; figure 5a) supports the hypothesis that
 xxxd168xxx  binding to closed channels might occur as well.
 xxxd168xxx  application caused a 7.6 mv shift in the herg
activation curve and a 7.6 mv shift in the half-maximal
inactivation voltage, which may cause a net increase of current
if other biophysical parameters remained unchanged. however, due to pronounced pharmacological herg channel
block, current increase could not be detected in our study.
unblocking upon repolarization, which allows herg channels to become available for opening, occurred rather slowly,
and a complete washout could not be achieved. the lack of
frequency dependence can be interpreted as the result of slow
unblocking kinetics, possibly due to a trapping mechanism of
the drug at its binding site (mitcheson et al., 2000b). in
summary, the biophysical mechanism of herg current block
by  xxxd168xxx  shares large similarities with mechanisms
observed among other drugs known to induce acquired long
qt syndrome through inhibition of herg channels (for
summary and comparison, see table 1).

the structural requirements for the drug-binding site in
herg as a basis for the unusual susceptibility of this
 xxxg1232xxx  to block by structurally diverse drugs have
recently been studied in detail. it has been demonstrated that
the aromatic rings of y652 and particularly f656 located in the
s6 domain are key determinants of drug binding (mitcheson
et al., 2000a), since mutation of these residues to alanine
dramatically reduced the potency of most drugs tested to date
(mitcheson, 2003). the lack of herg f656a and herg
y652a/f656a current inhibition clearly shows that  xxxd168xxx 
predominantly binds to a drug receptor within the pore-s6
region. this example supports the observation that the
aromatic pore residue y652 is less important for drug binding
compared to f656, since mutation of y652 produces only a
partial attenuation of block by several drugs tested to date
(including  xxxd168xxx ; table 1), compared with f656a which
attenuates drug block 100-fold (with the exception of
fluvoxamine, milnes et al., 2003).

clinical significance of herg channel inhibition by
 xxxd168xxx 
 xxxd168xxx  has been shown to induce pronounced qt interval
prolongation, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation
and death (van hoff et al., 1980; mclaughlin et al., 1983;
schwartz et al., 1984; shinar & hasin, 1984; griffin et al.,
1985; winton et al., 1985; dhaliwal et al., 1986; weiss et al.,
1986; seymour, 1993). thus, herg current block by
 xxxd168xxx  is of particular importance, since the induction
regimen in aml and treatment after relapses usually include
an anthracycline compound (including  xxxd168xxx ) (kantarjian
et al., 1996; arnaout et al., 2000; rowe, 2000). specific herg
channel inhibition by  xxxd168xxx  may be of high clinical
significance, since to date anticancer drugs have been thought
to exert rather unspecific cardiotoxic and arrhythmogenic
action. if during chemotherapy  xxxd168xxx  is administered in
combination with other compounds that inhibit herg
channels (e.g. antiemetic drugs such as odansetron; kuryshev
et al., 2000), the knowledge that  xxxd168xxx  blocks herg
channels may help preventing fatal arrhythmias due to even
more pronounced herg block in these cases. whether other
antineoplastic drugs (in particular anthracyclines) inhibit
herg currents as well will require further studies.

d. thomas et al

conclusions
our results demonstrate that  xxxd168xxx  is an antagonist of
cloned herg potassium channels, providing a molecular
explanation for the proarrhythmic potential of this drug.
further studies need to be conducted to determine additional
cardiac electrophysiological properties of  xxxd168xxx .
