advanced by an early and strong induction of  xxxg931xxx  and gonadotropin subunit gene expression during the infantile period,
followed by weaker persistent activation during puberty. developmental  xxxg931xxx  and gonadotropin b subunit gene expression
is almost entirely gnrh dependent, not only in the juvenile prepubertal stage but also during the infantile period.

abstract
appropriate expression of the  xxxg931xxx  ( xxxg931xxx ) in
gonadotrophs is critical for gnrh signaling and hence for gonadotropin secretion and sexual development. in the present
work, we have studied the ontogeny of the steady-state  xxxg931xxx  mrna levels in pituitaries of female rats from day 5 to day
55, when sexual maturity is attained. developmental changes of
gonadotropin subunit (a, fshb, and lhb) mrna levels were
also assessed. in addition, the role of the endogenous gnrh on
the maturational changes of  xxxg931xxx  and gonadotropin subunit
gene expression was investigated. messenger rna levels were
determined by northern blot analysis of total rna from anterior
pituitaries. amounts of the most abundant (5.0 kilobase [kb])
 xxxg931xxx  mrna increased slowly from day 5 through the infantile period, to peak at day 20 (ø4-fold increase vs. day 5).
thereafter the levels of the  xxxg931xxx  mrna decline abruptly by
day 25 (75% decrease vs. day 20) and then fell slightly until
day 35. parallel changes were observed on the 4.5-kb transcript
of the  xxxg931xxx  gene.  xxxg216xxx  mrna was easily detected
at day 5 and its levels increased quickly through the beginning
of the infantile period to peak at day 10 (3.2-fold increase vs.
day 5); then it decreased by 85% at day 35. fshb and lhb
mrna levels rose slowly until days 15–20, a short time before
 xxxg931xxx . thereafter, the levels of both mrnas fell until day 35
(90% decrease vs. day 15 for fshb and 50% decrease vs. day
20 for lhb). to ascertain whether developmental activation of
the  xxxg931xxx  and gonadotropin subunit gene expression is gnrh
dependent, we have studied the effect of blocking the endogenous gnrh action by treating developing female rats with the
specific gnrh antagonist  xxxd466xxx  (1.5 mg/kg body weight/wk,
s.c.) through the infantile (days 5–20) and the juvenile period
(days 20–35).  xxxd466xxx  completely blocked the rise of levels
of the two most abundant species, 5.0 kb and 4.5 kb, of  xxxg931xxx  mrna during the infantile phase and dropped them to almost
undetectable levels during the juvenile prepubertal period.  xxxd466xxx  also abolished the developmental rise of gonadotropin
b subunit mrnas during the two periods of the study. in contrast,  xxxg220xxx  gene expression tended to decrease, but not
significantly, with  xxxd466xxx  treatment during the two periods.

introduction

pubertal development in mammals results from a complex cascade of progressive maturational events involving
the entire gonadal axis. it is heralded by increasing pulsatile
secretion of gonadotropins in response to augmented pulsatile gnrh secretion. the  xxxg931xxx  ( xxxg931xxx )
plays an essential role in this process allowing gnrh signaling to the gonadotroph cell.
based on endocrinological and morphological landmarks, the postnatal development of the female rat has been
divided into several phases [1]. 1) the first week after birth
is considered as the neonatal period, the time at which the
hypophysial portal system becomes established and the
ovary acquires steroidal responsiveness to gonadotropins.
2) the infantile period extends from day 7 to day 21. by
the end of this period, serum fsh levels have already declined and the estrogen negative feedback has become operative. the serum concentration of a-fetoprotein has decreased considerably, thus allowing an increased uptake of
estrogen by tissues; the stimulatory effect of estradiol on
gonadotropin release can be unambiguously demonstrated
and ovarian follicular development has progressed to follicles with 200–400 cells. 3) the next phase is a juvenile
or prepubertal period that extends from day 21 to the time
at which uterine fluid appears for the first time (around day
32–37), at which time serum gh levels have developed and
adult patterns of release and pituitary responsiveness to
gnrh have decreased to a minimum. the end of this period is not as well defined as those previously described
because it usually continues with the peripubertal period,
which begins at variable ages after day 30. 4) the peripubertal period is characterized by marked increases in
uterine weight, accumulation of uterine fluid, and enhanced
ovarian responsiveness to gonadotropins; it culminates with
the first preovulatory surge of gonadotropins and vaginal
opening, events that are followed by the first estrus and
initiation of luteal function.
several aspects of the maturational changes in the hypothalamic-gonadotroph cell unit of female rats have already been described. hypothalamic prognrh mrna levels increase steadily (ø3.5-fold) during the first 45 days of
life [2] and are accompanied by parallel changes in hypo-

 xxxg931xxx  gene expression in pubertal development

thalamic gnrh content [3]. moreover, the pituitary content
of fsh and lh increase with age, reaching maximum levels of both gonadotropins at day 20, with a second peak
for lh on day 32 [4]. also, ligand binding studies have
demonstrated that the number of gnrh receptors in female
rat pituitaries increases progressively during the neonatal
[5] and the infantile stages, peaking at day 20 (ø2-fold),
15 days earlier than in males [6, 7]. thereafter, it declines
abruptly to lower levels at days 30–50. moreover, pituitary
responsiveness to gnrh follows the same pattern as receptor number [8, 9], indicating its functionality. very recently,
the developmental pattern of the  xxxg931xxx  mrna levels in
male rats has been reported, showing a progressive accumulation, to peak at day 35 with a small decline thereafter
[10]. however, little is known regarding the developmental
pattern of the  xxxg931xxx  gene expression in the female rat
at the mrna level. studies focused on the infantile period,
by using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(rt-pcr) assay, revealed an increase (ø2-fold) of the
 xxxg931xxx  mrna levels from day 8 to day 12, with a decline thereafter, in a profile similar to fshb [11]. however,
no data are available regarding the juvenile and peripubertal
stages.
since the  xxxg931xxx  gene has been cloned, several experiments performed in vitro demonstrated that its expression is directly regulated by two signals, pulsatile gnrh
[12, 13] and activin [14, 15]. because pubertal development
is accompanied by increased pulsatile gnrh secretion, this
presumably leads to an activation of pituitary  xxxg931xxx 
gene expression. in fact, in a previous work, we have demonstrated that pubertal activation of the  xxxg931xxx  gene expression is entirely gnrh dependent as it is blocked by a
gnrh antagonist, both during the infantile and juvenile
periods of male rat development [10]. studies performed in
the late juvenile stage of female rats, by using rt-pcr
assay, demonstrated that  xxxg931xxx  mrna levels declined
in response to a gnrh antagonist [16, 17]. however, other
authors reported no changes in the  xxxg931xxx  and fshb
gene expression in response to a gnrh antagonist during
the infantile period [11]. this questions the role of gnrh
in the control of gonadotroph gene expression during the
infantile stage of female rat development. therefore, in order to contribute to a better understanding of the molecular
basis of pubertal development, we have investigated the
ontogeny of the steady-state  xxxg931xxx  mrna levels in pituitaries of female rats from the infantile period to sexual
maturation. also, changes of the gonadotropin subunit (a,
lhb, and fshb) mrna levels were assessed in parallel
with those of the  xxxg931xxx . finally, to clarify the role of
the endogenous gnrh on the developmental regulation of
the gonadotroph gene expression at different stages of female rat puberty, we have studied the effect of  xxxd466xxx ,
a specific gnrh antagonist [18–21] on the regulation of
the  xxxg931xxx  and gonadotropin subunit mrna levels during the infantile and the juvenile prepubertal periods of the
female rat.
materials and methods

experimental design
for the ontogenic studies, female rats aged 5 (neonatal-infantile transition), 10, 15, 20, 25, 35, and 55 days (sexually mature rats) were used.
in order to obtain sufficient sample for analysis, anterior pituitaries from
several rats were pooled as follows: day 5, six animals/pool; day 10, four
animals/pool; days 15–25, three animals/pool; days 35–55, two animals/
pool. sera were pooled as follows: day 5, four rats/pool; day 10, three
rats/pool; days 15–25, two animals/pool. for days 35–55, hormone levels

349

were determined in serum samples from individual rats. total rna from
four pools of anterior pituitaries per group of age was extracted by the
method of chomczynski and sacchi [22] and analyzed by northern blot.
gonadotropin and estradiol levels were measured in pooled sera (six pools/
group of age) by specific rias.
to investigate the gnrh dependency of gonadotroph gene expression
during both the infantile and juvenile stages of sexual development, two
sets of experiments were conducted by using the specific gnrh antagonist
 xxxd466xxx . in the first set, looking at the infantile period, 5-day-old female
rats were treated by weekly s.c. injection (days 5, 12, and 19) of either
vehicle or  xxxd466xxx  acetate (1.5 mg/kg body weight [bw]), accordingly
to the manufacturer’s recommendations, to avoid unnecessary, more frequent injections. the last dose of  xxxd466xxx  was administered the day
before decapitation to assure appropriate blockade. both groups of rats,
vehicle- and  xxxd466xxx -treated rats, were killed on day 20. nontreated 5day-old female rats were killed to serve as controls of gonadotroph gene
expression at this age. in the second set of experiments, 20-day-old female
rats were treated as above until day 35 (injections on days 20, 27, and
34) (juvenile period). each experimental group consisted of six pools of
6 to 2 animals, as described for the ontogenic studies. the animals were
killed on day 35. a group of nontreated 20-day-old rats was killed and
used as controls of gonadotroph gene expression at this age. anterior
pituitaries were removed to analyze gonadotroph gene expression by
northern blot, and trunk blood was collected for hormone assays.

animals
female wistar rats, 5–55 days old, were obtained from iffa-credo
(charles river laboratories, barcelona, spain). five-day-old female rats
were delivered to our laboratory on day 4. the other age groups were
delivered 4 days before decapitation and maintained in a 12l:12d cycle
at 248c and with food and water ad libitum, either with their respective
mothers (10–20 days of age) or housed in groups of three animals/cage
(25–55 days of age). for gnrh antagonist experiments, female rats aged
4 (for the infantile period) or 16 days (for the juvenile period) were delivered to our laboratory with their mothers and maintained as above until
the day of sacrifice. all animals were killed by decapitation after ether
anesthesia between 0900 and 1000 h; trunk blood was collected for hormone assays, and sera were stored at 2208c until assayed. the anterior
pituitaries were separated from the intermediate and posterior lobes, frozen
on dry ice, and stored at 2808c until assayed. experimental protocol described within this report was approved by the animal research committee of our institution.

gnrh antagonist
as a gnrh antagonist, we used  xxxd466xxx  acetate (sb-75), generously
provided by asta medica (frankfurt/main, germany). for injection,  xxxd466xxx  was dissolved in distilled water containing 5% mannitol and administered s.c. through a 22-gauge needle.

northern blot analysis
twenty micrograms of total rna were electrophoresed on denaturing
1.2% agarose gels containing formaldehyde. rna was transferred onto a
duralon ultraviolet nylon membrane (stratagene, la jolla, ca) by diffusion blotting [23]. each blot was hybridized with a [32p]dctp-labeled rat
 xxxg931xxx  cdna probe [24] using conditions previously described [25].
blots were washed, subjected to autoradiography, and subsequently
stripped of radioactivity and rehybridized with specific [32p]dctp-labeled
rat cdna probes for fshb, lhb and a glycoprotein subunit. differences
in total rna loading among samples were corrected by  xxxg798xxx 
mrna quantitation in the same samples. the mrna levels were estimated on the basis of the intensity of the hybridization signal quantitated
by a densitometer.

serum gonadotropin and estradiol
serum lh and fsh were determined by ria using reagents generously supplied by dr. a.f. parlow (national hormone and pituitary program). lh-rp3 and fsh-rp2 were used as reference preparations. lh
and fsh were iodinated by the chloramine t method and specific rias
were performed according to the recommended procedure. the intra-assay
variations were 8% and 7% for lh and fsh, respectively. serum estradiol
was measured by ria using commercial kits obtained from diagnostic
products corporation dpc (los angeles, ca). the intra-assay variations

experiment were analyzed in duplicates in one assay.

statistical analysis
data are expressed as the mean 6 sd. statistical analysis of ontogeny
experiments was performed by using one-way anova. those experiments where the effects of two factors (age and  xxxd466xxx  treatment) were
studied, the two-way anova was performed. in both cases, bonferroni
posttest was used to establish the level of significance between a pair of
groups. statistics were done with the prism program (graphpad software,
inc., san diego, ca). a p value less than 0.05 was considered significant.

results

 xxxg931xxx  mrna levels

the two major species of  xxxg931xxx  mrna, 5.0 and 4.5
kilobase (kb), were present in the pituitaries of 5-day-old
female pups. as shown in figure 1, the levels of both transcripts increased through the infantile period to peak at day
20 (3.5-fold increase vs. day 5). thereafter, the levels of
both transcripts declined sharply by day 25 and then very
slowly until day 35. the other two much less abundant
transcripts, 2.5 and 1.3 kb, were almost undetectable and
therefore their levels were not quantitated.

as shown in figure 2, the  xxxg220xxx  mrna was easily
detected at day 5 and its levels increased rapidly to peak
at day 10 (3.5-fold increase vs. day 5). thereafter, the
levels declined slowly until day 55. fshb mrna levels
were also easily detected by day 5 and increased slowly to
peak at day 15 (3-fold increase vs. day 5), and then declined to very low levels by days 35 (peripubertal period).
lhb mrna levels followed a similar pattern as fshb,
peaking at days 15–20 with a smother falling thereafter
through the juvenile and peripubertal periods (fig. 2).
serum gonadotropin and estradiol levels

as shown in figure 3, serum fsh levels increased progressively to peak at day 15; then the levels fell to day
35, when they showed a small peak. in contrast, the circulating lh levels increased from day 5 to day 10, fell
slowly until day 25, reaching maximum levels at day 35,
when the estrous cycle has started. over the course of pubertal development in female rats, serum estradiol levels

gene expression

to investigate the role of the endogenous gnrh on the
 xxxg931xxx  gene expression during different stages of the female rat maturation, developing female rats were treated
either with vehicle or the gnrh antagonist  xxxd466xxx  during the infantile and juvenile stages of prepubertal development. as shown in figure 4,  xxxd466xxx  treatment completely abolished the rise of the two major species of the
 xxxg931xxx  mrna during the infantile period.  xxxd466xxx  also
abated the expression of the  xxxg931xxx  gene during the juvenile prepubertal period.

effect of the gnrh antagonist on serum gonadotropins
and estradiol levels

 xxxd466xxx  treatment decreased serum lh and fsh concentrations in both the infantile and the juvenile periods of
female rat pubertal development (table 1).  xxxd466xxx  treatment completely abated fsh levels during the two stages
of the development. meanwhile, lh levels are completely

it now seems clear that puberty is a gradual process that
is progressively manifested. to our knowledge, the present
work shows for the first time the developmental changes in
 xxxg931xxx  and gonadotropin subunit mrna levels in female
rats from day 5 to sexual maturity, as determined by northern blot analysis. the levels of the two major transcripts of
the  xxxg931xxx  gene, 5.0 and the 4.5 kb [24, 26], rose in
parallel to peak at day 20, at the end of infancy and long
before complete sexual maturation was attained. thereafter,
during the juvenile and peripubertal periods, levels of both
 xxxg931xxx  mrnas dropped markedly until estrous cycle
changes were operative in the mature female rat [27]. previous work has reported dynamic changes in the  xxxg931xxx 
mrna levels during the rat estrous cycle, with a 3-fold
increase on the afternoon of proestrus compared with the
morning of metaestrus [28]. therefore, values in 55-dayold rats, in our work, may reflect random estrous cycle
values because we have not checked the stage of the estrous
cycle in these rats. the ontogenetic patterns of gonadotropin b subunit gene expression are quite similar to that of
the  xxxg931xxx  gene. this pattern of gonadotroph gene expression is in agreement with many other reports about other facts of the female rat sexual maturation [for reviews,
see 1, 27]. thus, it parallels the profiles described for
 xxxg931xxx  number [6, 7], pituitary responsiveness to gnrh
[8, 9], pituitary gonadotropin content [4], and serum gonadotropin levels [1, 27], which are exceedingly high during infancy with a marked decline to low levels until the

 xxxg931xxx  gene expression in pubertal development

r and gonadotropin subunit gene expression in male rats
[10], where relatively lower levels were detected during
infancy and maximal levels at the end of the juvenile period
(day 35), close to sexual maturity. this shows a sexual
dimorphism in the developmental activation of the gonadotroph gene expression, occurring earlier in female than in
male rats.
inasmuch as pulsatile gnrh is the major positive regulatory signal for  xxxg931xxx  gene expression [12, 13], presumably most of the changes in  xxxg931xxx  mrna levels
during development might be induced by changes in endogenous gnrh secretion. our data show that the specific
gnrh antagonist  xxxd466xxx  completely prevents the rise in
levels of both  xxxg931xxx  gene transcripts during the infantile
period and also abated its expression during the juvenile
phase. this is in agreement with previous work indicating
that chronic administration of  xxxd466xxx  to adult female rats
caused a marked decrease in the levels of  xxxg931xxx  mrna
by counteracting the stimulatory effect of endogenous
gnrh [20]. also, it has been reported that chronic  xxxd466xxx  treatment of female rats from day 25 to day 36 downregulates (by 50%) the expression of the  xxxg931xxx  gene,
measured by quantitative rt-pcr assay [16, 17]. in the
same way as occurred with the  xxxg931xxx  gene,  xxxd466xxx 
prevented the infantile up-regulation of gonadotropin b
subunit mrnas and also abates their expression during the
juvenile prepubertal period. this is congruent with the
overwhelming evidence from in vivo and in vitro experiments indicating that lhb and fshb gene expression is
gnrh dependent [29–33]. also, the dramatic inhibition of
fshb mrna levels by  xxxd466xxx  suggests that pituitary
and gonadal activin is not a major contributor to the activation of the fshb gene expression, both during the infantile and prepubertal periods. however, a caveat to this conclusion must be introduced because great evidence indicates
that gnrh can indirectly regulate the fshb gene through
induction of activin and  xxxg816xxx  genes [34]. these data
indicate that developmental activation of the  xxxg931xxx  and
b-gonadotropin subunit gene expression in female rats is
entirely gnrh dependent, even at very early stages of development, such as the infantile period. thus, gonadotroph
gene expression during development is gnrh dependent in
both female and male rats. however, our results are in apparent discordance with another report by wilson et al. using rt-pcr assay [11]. despite the fact that serum fsh
and lh levels decreased in response to the gnrh antagonist, these authors observed that  xxxg931xxx  as well as gonadotropin b subunit mrnas were not affected by treatment of infantile female rats with a gnrh antagonist along
a period of 2 days (postnatal days 8–10 and 11–13) [11].
this lack of response to the gnrh antagonist treatment
may be attributed to a shorter period of treatment (2 days)
in comparison with the present work (15 days). another
possibility is that the gonadotroph has the capacity of responding to gnrh after the 13-day postnatal period. however, this is unlikely because functional  xxxg931xxx  [8, 9] and
hypothalamic expression of gnrh [2] and its secretion in
vitro by hypothalamic fragments [35, 36] have been present
since the neonatal period and are maintained during infancy
[35]. therefore, taken together, our results and the great
bulk of previous information indicate that the hypothalamic-gonadotroph unit of female rats is very active during the
infantile period, with a relative inhibition of neonatal levels
of activity during the juvenile prepubertal period, before
estrous cyclic activation occurs in sexually mature rats. the
most plausible explanation for this infantile activation of

353

the female rat reproductive axis is the presence of high
serum levels of a-fetoprotein, which binds estradiol selectively [37, 38] and renders the estradiol negative feedback
inefficient [39]. this allows a progressive activation of the
gonadal axis to peak at mid to late infancy. this trend is
deflected down during the juvenile period, when the estradiol negative feedback progressively takes place as long as
serum a-fetoprotein levels go down and estradiol production by developing ovaries increases. this negative feedback turns positive when estradiol circulating levels increase to a certain level, leading to the first preovulatory
gonadotropin surge at proestrus [40, 41].
the levels of glycoprotein  xxxg220xxx  mrna behave
slightly differently than those of b subunits.  xxxg216xxx 
mrna was easily detected during the neonatal period and
a more rapid increase is observed at the beginning of the
infantile period with a peak at day 10. it then decreased
slowly. these divergent patterns of mrna levels between
a and b subunits were also observed in male rats [10].
 xxxg216xxx  gene expression in thyrotropes (not regulated
by gnrh) can account for this different pattern of  xxxg220xxx  gene expression.
the ontogenetic patterns of  xxxg931xxx  and gonadotropin
b subunit gene expression, and gonadotropin secretion do
not show parallelism with prognrh mrna levels [2] and
gnrh content in the preoptic area-anterior hypothalamic
region of the rat brain [3, 42]. both hypothalamic prognrh
mrna and peptide content increased steadily and in parallel from birth to sexual maturity in males and females. in
contrast, gnrh secretion,  xxxg931xxx  and gonadotropin subunit expression, and gonadotropin secretion are all inhibited
during the juvenile period of female rat development. these
divergent ontogenetic patterns can be explained by differential actions of estradiol on the prognrh gene expression
and gnrh secretion [see ref. 41 for review]. while the role
of estrogen in the regulation of prognrh gene expression
is controversial, low concentrations are clearly inhibitory
for gnrh secretion [41]. thus, rising estradiol production
and secretion by the maturing ovaries during the juvenile
period does not affect gnrh gene expression and clearly
inhibits gnrh secretion, leading to a progressive increase
of both prognrh mrna and its peptide content in the
hypothalamus, while by inhibiting gnrh secretion, gonadotroph gene expression and gonadotropin secretion are decreased, as they are positively regulated by gnrh.
the ontogenetic profiles of serum gonadotropin levels in
our experiments, running in parallel with the gonadotroph
gene expression, are in agreement with many other reports
[1, 6, 7]. an early increase in the infantile period and a
later decrease during the juvenile stage until first ovulation,
when lh levels became maximal, occurred.
as previously reported [see 1, 27 for reviews], circulating estradiol ( xxxd2037xxx ) levels increase during infancy to reach a
first peak on day 15. however, as mentioned above, this
early wave of total circulating  xxxd2037xxx  does not correlate with
free, biologically active  xxxd2037xxx , which is likely to be low at
this time because estrogenization of target organs does not
become evident until around 35 days of age, when vaginal
opening indicates the rise in circulating free estradiol [1, 4,
8, 27].  xxxd2037xxx  levels decrease from day 15 to day 25 as long
as circulating a-fetoprotein falls. thereafter,  xxxd2037xxx  increased
again during pre- and peripuberty to reach a peak during
the first estrus, around days 35–45, reflecting the progressive maturation of ovarian steroidogenesis. as occurred
with  xxxg931xxx  and b-gonadotropin subunit gene expression,
serum lh and fsh levels dropped in response to the gnrh

354

zapatero-caballero et al.

antagonist during both the infantile and juvenile periods.
these results are in accordance with previous reports on
infantile [11], juvenile [16, 17], and adult [18] female rats.
although  xxxd2037xxx  levels tend to decrease in infantile rats treated
with the gnrh antagonist, it was not statistically significant. this, together with the fact that serum lh and fsh
levels were abated by  xxxd466xxx , suggests that much of the
circulating estradiol during the infancy of female rats is
from an extraovarian source, mainly from the adrenals, as
has been reported previously [43–45]. conversely, serum
estradiol rises during the juvenile prepubertal stage and was
suppressed by gnrh antagonist, indicating that the developing ovary at this stage is actively engaged in steroidogenesis, providing much of the circulating estradiol.
on the other hand,  xxxg220xxx  mrna levels tend to decrease after  xxxd466xxx  treatment during the infancy of female rats. however, this was not statistically significant.
this observation was, in some way, unexpected in light of
the numerous reports showing a gnrh dependence of a
subunit gene expression in vivo, explored with gnrh antagonist treatment [29, 30, 32, 33]. this different behavior
of the  xxxg220xxx  gene may be explained, at least partially,
by the contribution of the  xxxg220xxx  mrna expressed in
thyrotropes (not regulated by gnrh). alternatively, other
signals that could affect selectively the  xxxg220xxx  gene expression may overcome the blocking effect of  xxxd466xxx  on
the gnrh-regulated  xxxg220xxx  gene expression during sexual maturation.
in summary, this study shows that sexual development
in female rats is accompanied by a progressive and concerted expression of  xxxg931xxx  and gonadotropin subunit
genes in the anterior pituitary to reach maximal rates during
infancy and are kept at a minimum during the juvenile prepubertal period. this seems to be the major mechanism for
the patterns of synthesis of  xxxg931xxx  number, pituitary responsiveness to gnrh, and gonadotropin subunit synthesis
and gonadotropin secretion, being also greatest during infancy and lowest during prepuberty. this represents a striking sexual dimorphism in comparison with male rats, where
the activation of gonadotroph genes is continuous all along
prepubertal development, being greatest in a period closer
to sexual maturity. developmental activation of the expression of the  xxxg931xxx  and gonadotropin b subunit genes and
gonadotropin secretion is gnrh dependent, even during the
preliminary burst of the infantile activation. changes in estradiol production and secretion by the maturing ovary,
combined with the dramatic variation on serum levels of
the estradiol-selective binding protein a-fetoprotein, provided a plausible explanation for the sexual dimorphic pattern of gonadotroph gene expression in developing female
rats. very high levels of a-fetoprotein impede estradiol negative feedback on gnrh release, leading to the infantile
burst of gonadotroph gene expression that spurs ovarian
development. a striking drop in a-fetoprotein levels, together with increased estradiol synthesis and secretion by
the developing ovary, allows a progressive negative feedback on gnrh secretion, responsible for the partial inhibition of the juvenile prepubertal gonadotroph-ovarian axis.
the progressive rise of estradiol levels to the threshold necessary for positive feedback on the hypothalamus during
the first proestrous surge of gonadotropins, initiates the cyclic nature of mature ovarian function. the apparent gnrhindependent activation of  xxxg220xxx  gene expression can be
due to the contribution of  xxxg220xxx  mrna from thyrotropes. additionally, this raises the question of whether other
specific regulatory signals for the pituitary  xxxg220xxx  gene

expression, aside from gnrh and  xxxd3368xxx -releasing
hormone, could have a role.
