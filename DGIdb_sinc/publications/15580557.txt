 xxxg1027xxx  ( xxxg1027xxx ) and the highly homologous gene,  xxxg1026xxx  ( xxxg1026xxx ) code for gi-g protein-coupled
orphan receptors that recently have been discovered to be involved in the metabolic effects of niacin. the b
vitamin niacin is an important agent used in the treatment of dyslipidemias, but its use is limited by side effects.
the novel role of the adjacent  xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx  genes in the metabolism of niacin may provide new targets
for drug development. human genetic variations in  xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx  have been reported but have not been
studied in detail. these variations may play a role in the response to agents targeting receptors coded by these
genes. here we show that many of the nonsynonymous snps listed in public databases for  xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx 
are artifacts resulting from extensive homology between these two genes. this may be representative of a
neglected phenomenon in reporting sequences of highly homologous genes. we provide primer sequences that
permit selective amplification of the complete coding regions of  xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx . using these primers, we
show that subsequent sequencing of  xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx  reveals a novel and unique variation in the  xxxg1026xxx 
gene. haplotype analysis suggests four snps can define the five major haplotypes that lie within a single
haplotype block encompassing these two genes. hum mutat 25:18–21, 2005. r 2004 wiley-liss, inc.

introduction
 xxxg1027xxx  (hugo gene nomenclature committee approved
symbol:  xxxg1027xxx  [ xxxg1027xxx ]; mim#
606039), which codes for a putative gi-g protein-coupled
 xxxg565xxx , was recently identified as a receptor for
niacin and was proposed as a mediator of niacin’s effects on
lipoprotein metabolism [soga et al., 2003; tunaru et al., 2003;
wise et al., 2003]. all three of these groups also independently
discovered an adjacent, novel, highly homologous gene,  xxxg1026xxx 
( xxxg1026xxx ), coding for a receptor with higher affinity for niacin
[soga et al., 2003; tunaru et al., 2003; wise et al., 2003]. niacin is
a b vitamin, long known to alter lipid metabolism when given in
pharmacologic doses. it exerts beneficial effects on almost every
plasma lipoprotein class. it is the most effective agent for reducing
levels of lipoprotein (a) [lp(a)] and increases high-densitylipoprotein cholesterol [malik and kashyap, 2003]. niacin,
however, can lead to glucose intolerance and gout, and induces
cutaneous flushing and gastrointestinal symptoms, limiting its
clinical use in many patients. the recent discovery of  xxxg1027xxx  and
 xxxg1026xxx  as receptors for niacin provides a novel target for
development of pharmacologically improved agents. sequence
polymorphisms and mutations in  xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx  may play a
significant role in the response to agents targeting receptors coded
by these genes.

prior to screening of genomic dna for human  xxxg1027xxx  sequence
variants, we reviewed the national center for biotechnology
information snp database (ncbi dbsnp, build 121, june 1, 2004;
www.ncbi.nih.gov/snp), which listed nine synonymous and 21
nonsynonymous coding region snps for  xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx , a
higher than expected number for proteins with less than 400
amino acid residues [reich et al., 2002]. formatted sequence
alignment of  xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx  suggests that all of the
synonymous snps and seven nonsynonymous snps could be
explained as differences between the two genes, which share
greater than 96% homology (unigene cluster id: hs. 137555;
www.ncbi.nih.gov/unigene). we hypothesized that the high
degree of similarity of these genes limits differentiation of  xxxg1027xxx 
and  xxxg1026xxx  and may explain the high number of snps found in

 xxxg1027xxx  ( xxxg1027xxx ) and  xxxg1026xxx  variations

the ncbi dbsnp database. the following studies were conducted
to develop an analytical strategy to identify snp artifacts, confirm
true snps in each of the genes, and to discover novel mutations in
 xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx .
materials and methods
subjects
genomic dna was extracted from white blood cells of an
unselected control population (n = 98) from the university of
california, san francisco (ucsf) genomic resource in arteriosclerosis [pullinger et al., 2002]. informed consent approved by the
institutional review board had been obtained from all subjects
prior to dna isolation.
pcr and primers
we designed primers for exclusive amplification of cdna of the
complete coding regions of hm 74 and  xxxg1026xxx . the online
software program primer 3 (http://biotools.umassmed.edu) and the
program macvector v7.0 (oxford molecular, now accelrys,
cambridge, uk) were used for primer optimization. primers used
for selective amplification of  xxxg1027xxx  were: sense 50 tga cat
gac ata aag gca ggc ac 30 ; and antisense 50 ctg cca
cag ttt ccc taa atc ag 30 . primers used for selective
amplification of  xxxg1026xxx  were: sense 50 tga cat gac ata
aag gca ggc  xxxg889xxx  30 ; and antisense 50 ca ccg ttt ccc
taa atc gc 30 .

mutation analysis by direct sequencing and
restriction enzyme digestion
after selective amplification for  xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx , pcr
products underwent direct sequencing using an abi prism 3700
genetic analyzer (applied biosystems, foster city, ca).
sequences were analyzed using sequencher software (gene codes
corporation, ann arbor, mi). direct sequencing of  xxxg1027xxx  and
 xxxg1026xxx , and discriminating restriction digests (xcm1,  xxxg655xxx , and
mfe1) confirmed the separate amplification of the genes, which
includes a unique sequence omission (5 bp) at codon 363 in
 xxxg1026xxx  relative to  xxxg1027xxx  (see discussion and the legend
for fig. 1). subsequently, restriction enzyme digestions were
conducted in an unselected control population (n = 77) as listed
in table 1. several snps required the design of nested pcrs to
introduce differentiating restriction enzyme sites (table 1).
nomenclature
the reference sequences utilized were  xxxg1027xxx .1 ( xxxg1027xxx )
and  xxxg1026xxx .3 ( xxxg1026xxx ) from the ucsc genome browser
(ucsc version hg16, http://genome.ucsc.edu, based on ncbi
build 34 by the human genome sequencing consortium,
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome//seq/). for cdna numbering, +1
corresponds to the a of the atg translation initiation codon of
the reference sequence. the initiation codon was codon 1 and
codons were numbered subsequently (see also den dunnen and
paalman [2003] and www.hgvs.org/mutnomen).

dbsnp cluster id rs2454726 was assigned to c.758 in  xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx , despite the physical distance of these loci (see discussion).

haplotype analysis
after genotyping, data were analyzed using phase v2.0.2
[stephens et al., 2001] for further haplotype analysis. the phase
program implements a new method, described by stephens et al.
[2001], for reconstructing haplotypes from population genotype
data based on bayesian statistics. experiments with the software
on both real and simulated data indicate that this method can
provide an improvement on the em algorithm for reconstructing
haplotypes; the phase mean error rate averages one-half
that obtained by the em algorithm. haplotypes derived from
phase were then analyzed in haploblockfinder v0.6b (http:
//archimedes.well.ox.ac.uk/pise) [zhang and jin, 2003], an online
utility. linkage disequilibrium (ld) was estimated between pairs of
diallelic loci using the absolute unsigned value of lewontin’s |d0 |.
lewontin’s |d0 | was chosen for estimates of ld because it is less
sensitive to allele frequency differences. haplotype tagging snps
(htsnps) defining the major haplotypes within blocks were
visually derived.
results
coding and flanking regions of  xxxg1027xxx , which comprises a single
exon of 1,164 bp that codes for 387 residues, and  xxxg1026xxx , which
comprises a single exon of 1,092 bp that codes for 363 residues,
were selectively amplified. discriminating restriction enzyme
digestions were performed using xcm1 and  xxxg655xxx  to selectively
cut the amplified  xxxg1026xxx  product (xcm1: 687 bp, 648 bp;  xxxg655xxx :
1,150 bp, 185 bp) and using mfe1 to selectively cut the  xxxg1027xxx 
product (mfe1: 795 bp, 535 bp). in contrast, amplification of

genomic dna with nonselective primers confirmed simultaneous
amplification of coding regions of  xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx  (data not
shown).
sequencing of  xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx  products in 21 unselected
control subjects showed an absence of 12 out of 17 snps (table 1).
we identified one novel rare variation (c.421c>t) in  xxxg1026xxx .
table 1 lists allele frequencies for snps in a group of 77 unselected
individuals. synonymous variants in that region were only
analyzed in the direct sequencing cohort, and only one snp was
confirmed (c.348a>c in  xxxg1027xxx ).
haplotype analysis revealed that five haplotypes, each with
>5% frequency, account for >90% of all predicted haplotypes
(fig. 1). subsequent analysis by haploblockfinder suggests that
these haplotypes are in ld and that  xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx  lie within
a single haploblock. not unexpected for such a small physical
distance (12 kb), ld between the seven snps tested was
extensive, with lewontin’s |d0 | ranging from 0.9293 to 1.000.
the four htsnps selected ( xxxg1027xxx : c.592t>c, c.1038c>g; and
 xxxg1026xxx : c.931c>t, c.951g>a) defined all five haplotypes in
this region of the haplotype block (fig. 1).
discussion
this study demonstrates that reported genetic variations in
 xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx  contain a significant number of spurious
snps. our findings highlight the limitations of current methodology to analyze highly homologous genes. this is of substantial
concern for the utilization of sequence databases in drug discovery

 xxxg1027xxx  ( xxxg1027xxx ) and  xxxg1026xxx  variations

and in related applications such as pharmacogenomics. with the
development of techniques to allow whole-genome sequence
analyses and advances in comparative genomics, the robustness
and redundancy of snp databases is steadily improving, but
refined techniques may be required to deal with genes with close
homology such as  xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx .
population haplotype estimates derived from our unselected
control population suggest that  xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx  snps are not
only frequent, but serve to discriminate the coding sequence of
these genes. previous studies suggest that these receptors are
relatively unresponsive to niacin [wise et al., 2003] in physiologic
doses, and that pharmacologic doses are required to elicit response
from these receptors. the impact of these snps (particularly the
discriminating snps) on relative niacin response is therefore
important, because discovery of potent and selective ligands for
these receptors may be limited by differential pharmacologic
responses based on the haplotype. the nonsynonymous nucleotide
changes in  xxxg1027xxx  (p.phe198leu, p.his253arg; see fig. 1) fall
within two predicted  xxxg1608xxx  (tmr) domains
(tmr 5 and 6) and may lead to disorientation of these domains
[wise et al., 2003].
these detected snps are major discriminating features within
the coding regions of  xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx . in addition, a
fundamental distinguishing feature is the 5-bp omission in
 xxxg1026xxx  relative to  xxxg1027xxx . this results in an earlier termination
codon (364 residues) when compared to  xxxg1027xxx  (388 residues).
preliminary haplotype construction in a pilot sample and
followed by subsequent selection of htsnps can significantly
reduce genotyping effort (and its associated cost and multiple
testing constraints) when evaluating the association of common
variants with disease. more importantly, genotyping of the htsnps
ensures that all common variations within a region of ld are
surveyed in a disease association study. haplotype analysis suggests
that four htsnps can define the five major haplotypes that lie
within a single haplotype block encompassing these two genes. it is
worth noting that the absolute boundaries of this haplotype block
have yet to be defined. thus, additional haplotypes and
constituent htsnps may exist. nevertheless, the htsnps provided
herein are sufficient to direct studies of the  xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx 
gene homologs.
the full scope of the biological roles of these receptors is yet to
be explored. there are several important effects of niacin on
plasma lipoprotein metabolism, including major attenuation of
hypertriglyceridemia, lowering of ldl and lp(a) lipoproteins, and
increase in hdl. it will be necessary to identify which of these

21

effects involve these receptors. as the biological knowledge about
the effects of niacin evolves, the functional importance of the
polymorphisms in these loci can be explored in detail and
extended to other related metabolic syndromes such as insulin
resistance, hypertension, and atherosclerosis [karpe and frayn,
2004].
