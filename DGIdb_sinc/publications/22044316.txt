background and purpose
phagocyte function is critical for host defense against infections. defects in phagocytic function lead to several primary
immunodeficiencies characterized by early onset of recurrent and severe infections. in this work, we further investigated the
effects of bay 41-2272, a soluble  xxxg1587xxx  (sgc) agonist, on the activation of human peripheral blood monocytes
(pbm) and thp-1 cells.

experimental approach
thp-1 cells and pbm viability was evaluated by methylthiazoletetrazolium assay; reactive oxygen species production by
lucigenin chemiluminescence; gene and protein expression of napdh oxidase components by qrt-pcr and western blot
analysis, respectively; phagocytosis and microbicidal activity by co-incubation, respectively, with zymosan and escherichia coli;
and cytokine release by elisa.

key results
bay 41-2272, compared with the untreated group, increased spreading of monocytes by at least 35%, superoxide production
by at least 50%, and gp91phox and  xxxg1509xxx  gene expression 20 to 40 times, in both pbm and thp-1 cells. bay 41-2272 also
augmented phagocytosis of zymosan particles threefold compared with control, doubled microbicidal activity against e. coli
and enhanced the release of  xxxg2296xxx  and il-12p70 by both pbm and thp-1 cells. finally, by inhibiting sgc with odq, we
showed that bay 41-2272-induced superoxide production and phagocytosis is not dependent exclusively on sgc activation.

conclusions and implications
in addition to its ability to induce vasorelaxation and its potential application for therapy of vascular diseases, bay 41-2272
was shown to activate human mononuclear phagocytes. hence, it is a novel pro-inflammatory drug that may be useful for
controlling infections in the immunocompromised host.

introduction
phagocytes are responsible for the initiation of the immune
response and their primary functions are the identification,
ingestion (phagocytosis) and elimination of microorganisms,
cellular debris and circulating immune complexes (flannagan
et al., 2009). phagocytes are very important not only as effector cells but also as regulators of inflammatory responses, by
releasing cytokines and several other mediators (aggelidou
et al., 2002). primary defects in phagocytes result in the early
onset of recurrent infections that lead to death if not properly
managed (samarghitean et al., 2009).
chronic granulomatous disease (cgd) is an example of
defective phagocytes, where these cells are unable to produce
reactive oxygen species (ros), resulting in flawed microbial
killing (geha et al., 2007). ros are involved in phagocyte
microbicidal mechanisms and are produced by the nadph
oxidase system, which consists of four main components,
namely  xxxg1508xxx  and  xxxg1509xxx , found in the cytosol; and
p22phox and gp91phox, the so-called membrane cytochrome
b558. these components are encoded, respectively, by  xxxg1508xxx ,
 xxxg1509xxx , cyba and cybb genes (el-benna et al., 2005). ifn-g
therapy reduces the relative risk of severe infections in 70% in
patients with cgd (ezekowitz et al., 1988; kobayashi et al.,
2008); however, the mechanism involved in this reduction,
initially attributed to positive regulation of inos (inducible
nos), has not been confirmed (condino-neto et al., 1996).
therefore, other mechanisms have been investigated to
explain the beneficial effects of ifn-g in cgd (condino-neto
and newburger, 2000).
one of the most biologically relevant actions of no is its
binding to the haeme moiety in the soluble  xxxg1587xxx 
(sgc), leading to intracellular accumulation of the second
messenger molecule, cgmp, which, in turn, regulates numerous pathophysiological processes (pacher et al., 2007). there
is extensive literature showing the relevance of no in the
microbicidal mechanisms against several intracellular pathogens in experimental models (bogdan, 2001). in addition,
cgmp has been shown to be a key messenger in many cellular
immune processes, such as differentiation, chemotaxis, proliferation and release of soluble mediators (kobialka and
gorczyca, 2001; ciuman et al., 2006).
no-independent sgc activators have emerged as valuable
tools for investigating the physiopathology of the no–sgc–
cgmp signalling pathway (stasch et al., 2001). one of most
studied no-independent sgc stimulator is bay 41-2272,
which is reported to act in synergism with no to produce
anti-aggregating, anti-proliferative and vasodilator effects
(evgenov et al., 2007). our group has recently demonstrated
that bay 41-2272 increases the production of cgmp, release
of superoxide and cybb gene expression in human thp-1
mononuclear cells (oliveira-junior et al., 2007). these findings raise a new perspective for the development of new
therapies for phagocyte defects and to treat infections by
directly activating phagocytes and other cells of the immune
system.
the aim of this work was to further evaluate the effects of
bay 41-2272 on the activation of human peripheral blood
monocytes (pbm) and thp-1 cells. we specifically investigated the production of superoxide, expression of genes
encoding components of the nadph oxidase system, spread1618

ing, phagocytosis, microbicidal activity and cytokine release
by these cells, all important indicators of phagocyte function.

methods
isolation and culture of human pbm and
thp-1 cells
peripheral blood monocyte cells (pbmc) were obtained from
healthy volunteers and were isolated by density-gradient centrifugation over  xxxd3253xxx -paque® (sigma chemical co., st.
louis, mo, usa), followed by anti- xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  antibody-labelled
magnetic beads columns for pbm isolation (macs separator,
mylteni biotec, bergish gladbach, germany). the cells were
washed three times with pbs and re-suspended in rpmi 1640
culture medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal calf serum (gibco, grand island, ny, usa). thp-1 cells
obtained from atcc (manassas, va, usa) (human acute
monocytic leukaemia cell line) were maintained as previously
described (tsuchiya et al., 1980).

cell viability
cell viability was assessed using a method based on the mitochondrial reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (mtt; 5 mg· xxxg1167xxx ) to formazan
(thomazzi et al., 2005). cells (1 ¥ 106 cells· xxxg1167xxx , 100 ml) were
treated with either bay 41-2272 (1.0, 3.0 and 10.0 mm),
 xxxd2925xxx  (pma; 30 and 300 nm) or dimethyl
sulfoxide (dmso, drug vehicle, 0.7%) for either 30 or
120 min at 37°c. preliminary screening experiments were
carried out to select effective drug concentrations not toxic to
cells. previous studies have demonstrated that concentrations
of bay 41-2272 (up to 10.0 mm) are effective in inducing the
production of cgmp and camp in mononuclear cells
(oliveira-junior et al., 2007).

measurement of superoxide production
superoxide anion production by pbm and thp-1 cells was
measured as described previously (hatanaka et al., 2006).
after a 48 h incubation with or without bay 41-2272 (1.0 and
3.0 mm) or ifn-g (100 u· xxxg1167xxx ), a lucigenin (1 mm)-preloaded
cell suspension (1 ¥ 106 cells· xxxg1167xxx , 100 ml) was stimulated by
adding pma (30 nm) or ifn-g (100 u· xxxg1167xxx ). the chemiluminescence was monitored for 2 h using a microplate luminometer reader (eg&g berthold lb96v, bad wildbad, germany),
and the results are expressed as relative light units (rlu).
peak levels of rlu were recorded to calculate the mean of the
maximum superoxide production during the observation
period.

cybb, cyba,  xxxg1508xxx  and  xxxg1509xxx 
mrna expression
mrna was obtained after lysis of pbm and thp-1 cells
(1 ¥ 107 cells· xxxg1167xxx ) previously treated for 48 h with ifn-g
(100 u· xxxg1167xxx ) or bay 41-2272 (1.0 and 3.0 mm) using trizol
reagent (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa) followed by reverse
transcription with super script iii rt and random hexamers

p22phox,  xxxg1508xxx  and  xxxg1509xxx  protein
expression by western blot
pbm were first treated with ifn-g (100 u· xxxg1167xxx ) or bay 41-2272
(1.0 and 3.0 mm) for 48 h. after removal of the medium, cells
(1 ¥ 107 cells· xxxg1167xxx ) were washed in pbs and lysed in ice-cold
lysis buffer [2% triton x-100, 10 mm tris–hcl (ph 8),
150 mm nacl, 2 mm nan3, 2 mm edta] containing protease
inhibitors (roche molecular biochemicals, indianapolis, in,
usa) for 45 min at 4°c. the soluble proteins (20 mg) were
separated by 7.5% sds-page, and the gel was electroblotted
on nitrocellulose membrane (hybond-ecl; amersham, buckinghamshire, uk) and then probed with monoclonal antibodies for p22phox,  xxxg1508xxx ,  xxxg1509xxx  or b-actin, according to the
method described by chen et al. (2004). the immunoblots
were labelled with horseradish-labelled anti-mouse igg and
detected via enhancement with chemiluminescence reagent.
the total pixel intensity analyses of the blots were conducted
by using imagej 1.44 (developed by wayne rasband, national
institutes of health, bethesda, md, usa; available at http://
rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html).

gp91phox protein expression by flow cytometry
gp91phox expression in pbm (1 ¥ 106 cells· xxxg1167xxx ) treated with
pma (30 nm), ifn-g (100 u· xxxg1167xxx ) or bay 41-2272 (1.0 and
3.0 mm) for 48 h was assessed by using mabs directed against
an external epitope of gp91phox (7d5; yamauchi et al., 2001).
fluorescence was measured on a facscanto ii flow cytometry
(bd biosciences, san diego, ca, usa), and results are
expressed as percentage of cells expressing gp91phox and mean
fluorescence intensity (mfi) values in arbitrary units (au).

spreading assay
after a 1 or 48 h incubation with bay 41-2272 (1.0 and
3.0 mm), ifn-g (100 u· xxxg1167xxx ) or pma (30 nm), pbm and thp-1
cells were labelled with a fluorescent dye, calcein-am (blease
et al., 1999). for spreading assays, 100 ml of 1 ¥ 106 cells· xxxg1167xxx 
labelled cells were placed over microscope glass slides for 1 h.
analysis was performed using a phase-contrast microscope
(nikon, tokyo, japan) at 400¥ magnification. the results are
expressed as the percentage of adherent cells from a total of
200 cells.

phagocytosis assay
after a 48 h treatment with or without bay 41-2272 (1.0 and
3.0 mm) or ifn-g (100 u· xxxg1167xxx ), pbm and thp-1 cells (1 ¥ 106
cells· xxxg1167xxx ) were incubated with zymosan (sigma; 1 ¥ 107
particles· xxxg1167xxx ) for 2 h and stimulated by adding pma
(30 nm) or ifn-g (100 u· xxxg1167xxx ). phagocyting cells were
defined on phase-contrast microscope (nikon) as cells that
internalized two or more particles. results are expressed as a
percentage of phagocyting cells from a total of 200 cells.

microbicidal activity
an enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) strain was used
for microbicidal assays. epec were cultured overnight in
brain heart infusion broth (bhi – fluka, bucks, switzerland)
under shaking, at 37°c, and its concentrations were estimated photometrically (an optical density of 1.0 at 600 nm
was equivalent to 1 ¥ 108 bacteria· xxxg1167xxx ). the cfu assay was
performed as described previously (bellinati-pires et al.,
1995). a proportion of 1:10 of cells and epec, opsonized or
not with fresh human serum (fhs), were mixed and incubated at 37°c under shaking for 30, 60, 90 and 120 min, after
which cells were lysed with 1.5% triton x-100. recovered
bacteria were re-suspended in bhi broth and plated on bhi
agar for an overnight incubation at 37°c. the colonies were
counted and the cfu number was converted to % bacteria
survived (bellinati-pires et al., 1995). microbicidal activity
was calculated as follows: 100 – [(cfu at time t/cfu at time
0) ¥ 100] and expressed as % of maximum microbicidal activity (minimum % bacteria survived).

cytokine production
pbm and thp-1 cells were cultured at 1 ¥ 106 cells· xxxg1167xxx  into
12-well plates treated with bay 41-2272 (1.0 and 3.0 mm) or
ifn-g (100 u· xxxg1167xxx ) for 48 h. supernatants were collected and
assayed by elisa for il-12p70 or  xxxg2296xxx  release (bd biosciences) as described previously (pitzurra et al., 2000).

bay 41-2272 actions through sgc pathway
we performed a number of experiments using odq [100 mm
1h-(1,2,4) oxadiazole (4,3-a) quinoxaline-1-one], a specific
sgc inhibitor, to investigate the effects of bay 41-2272 on
superoxide production and phagocytosis mediated through
the sgc pathway. we established two groups of treatments:
(i) cells treated for 2 h together or not with pma (30 nm),
ifn-g (100 u· xxxg1167xxx ) or bay 41-2272 (1.0 and 3.0 mm); (ii) cells

human pbm or thp-1 cell suspensions (2 ¥ 106 cells· xxxg1167xxx ) were incubated at 37°c for 30 min or 120 min with bay 41-2272 (1.0–10.0 mm)

odq was given 1 h before treatments to guarantee its
binding and inactivation of sgc. after this, we performed the
same protocols described above, and analysed superoxide
release and phagocytosis.

data analysis and statistical procedures

results are expressed as mean ⫾ sem of n experiments. statistical analysis was carried out using a two-way anova followed by the bonferroni post-test for multiple comparisons
(erceg-hurn and mirosevich, 2008). graphpad prism version
5.0 (graphpad, san diego, ca, usa) was used to perform
statistical analysis; results were deemed significant if p < 0.05.

or thp-1 cells to bay 41-2272 (1.0–10.0 mm) caused any toxic
effect (two-way anova, n = 6, p > 0.05; table 2). the vehicle
used for bay 41-2272 (0.7% dmso) also does not affect cell
viability.

bay 41-2272 increases ifn-g- and
pma-induced superoxide production by
human pbm and thp-1 cells

human ifn-g was purchased from r&d systems (minneapolis, mn), and pma from sigma (st. louis, mo, usa). bay
41-2272 was provided by pharma research center, bayer ag
(wuppertal, germany).

as ros is known to have an important function in cellmediated microbial death, we assessed whether bay 41-2272
directly stimulated ros production, as assayed by lucigeninchemiluminescence. we used ifn-g and pma to stimulate
ros production and enable comparison between these treatments and bay 41-2272 stimulation. bay 41-2272 (1.0 and
3.0 mm) increased the amount of superoxide released by pbm
and thp-1 cells after direct stimulation for 2 h (two-way
anova, n = 6, p < 0.05) and also after 48 h with the 3.0 mm
dose. bay 41-2272 primed the pbm and thp-1 cells so that
both ifn-g and pma were more potent at releasing superoxide after stimulation for 48 h (two-way anova, n = 6, p < 0.05;
figure 1a,b).

nadph oxidase system also involves gene expression
(condino-neto et al., 1998). therefore, we assessed whether
bay 41-2272 had an effect on cybb, cyba,  xxxg1508xxx  and  xxxg1509xxx

figure 1
bay 41-2272 primed thp-1 cells and pbm for a potent release of superoxide after ifn-g or pma stimulation. bay 41-2272 treatment (1.0 or
3.0 mm) for 2 and 48 h increases superoxide release in thp-1 (a) and pbm (b), as assessed by lucigenin-chemiluminescence assay, and was even
more effective with subsequent stimulation with pma (30 nm) or ifn-g (100 u· xxxg1167xxx ) for 2 h. results are expressed in rlu as a mean ⫾ sem of

gene expression. treatment of pbm and thp-1 cells with bay
41-2272 for 48 h caused a significant increase in cybb and
 xxxg1509xxx  expression, but not in cyba and  xxxg1508xxx , both at 1.0 and
3.0 mm (two-way anova, n = 6, p < 0.05; figure 2) compared
with basal gene expression.

bay 41-2272 increases  xxxg1509xxx  and gp91phox
protein expression
as we had demonstrated that bay 41-2272 increased the
levels of expression of cybb and  xxxg1509xxx , we evaluated the
protein expression of nadph oxidase components. our
western blot results confirmed that bay 41-2272 increased
the expression of  xxxg1509xxx  but no changes in protein expression of p22phox and  xxxg1508xxx  were observed (two-way anova,
n = 4, p < 0.05; figure 3a). similarly, the flow cytometry of
gp91phox showed an increased expression of this protein in
groups treated with bay 41-2272 (two-way anova, n = 4, p <
0.05; figure 3b). these results show that gene and protein
expression of these components was increased (figure 2).

bay 41-2272 increases spreading
and phagocytosis
the early defence response of mononuclear phagocytes
involves the ingestion of microorganisms and the generation
of activation signals by these cells. bay 41-2272 (1.0 and

3.0 mm), treatment for 1 h or 48 h, increased the phagocytosis of zymosan induced by pbm and thp-1 cells (two-way
anova, n = 6, p < 0.05; figure 4b,d). the same pattern of
response was observed for spreading (figure 4a,c).

bay 41-2272 increases the bactericidal
activity against e. coli
phagocytosis and ros generation by mononuclear phagocytes have been kinetically correlated with increased bactericidal activity (deleo et al., 1999). treatment with bay
41-2272 (1.0 or 3.0 mm) produced a significant increase in the
bactericidal activity of pbm and thp-1 cells against epec
(two-way anova, n = 6, p < 0.05; figure 5a,b). these results
showed even higher significance for opsonized bacteria.

bay 41-2272 increases the release of  xxxg2296xxx 
and il-12p70
cytokine production is a major aspect of the immune
response and they are involved in both effector and regulatory mechanisms, including mononuclear phagocytes (geissmann et al., 2008). culturing pbm and thp-1 cells with bay
41-2272 (1.0 and 3.0 mm) for 48 h caused an increase in
 xxxg2296xxx  and il-12p70 production (two-way anova, n = 6, p <
0.05; figure 6).

bay 41-2272 produces effects on pbm and
thp-1 cells through sgc pathway,
specifically inhibited by odq
to clarify the pathways involved in the effects of bay
41-2272, we inhibited sgc with odq to evaluate the specific
interaction of the drug with this enzyme. we observed that
treatment with odq did not result in a significant reduction
of bay 41-2272 effects on the parameters investigated, even
when cells were treated with the higher dose of the compound (3 mm). with regard to the production of ros (twoway anova, n = 6, p < 0.05; figure 7), the groups treated with
bay 41-2272 plus odq did not show a significant reduction
in ros production in any of the concentrations used. even
when we did the pretreatment for 48 h, in the absence or
presence of odq, bay 41-2272 still showed considerable
effects on ros production (two-way anova, n = 6, p < 0.05;

(two-way anova, n = 6, p < 0.05; figure 8), using the same
incubation protocol.

discussion and conclusions
the present study clearly demonstrates that 2 or 48 h treatment with bay 41-2272 (1.0 or 3.0 mm) caused a marked
increase in the activation of pbm and thp-1 cells, as demonstrated by induction of oxidative burst, increased phagocytosis and microbicidal activity, enhancement of il-12p70 and
 xxxg2296xxx  release, and also increased expression of cybb and
 xxxg1509xxx  genes in these cells. these observations support the
hypothesis that bay 41-2272 activates mononuclear phagocytes and has the potential to be used in the control of
infections in the immunocompromised host.

quantified by western blot (normalized to b-actin) and flow cytometry, respectively. cells were also treated with ifn-g (100 u· xxxg1167xxx ) and pma
(30 nm for flow cytometry). dashed line represents basal expression normalized to b-actin expression. for western blot, results are shown as a

ros have an important function in cell-mediated microbial death and are an important indicator of monocytic cell
activation (huang et al., 2008). we used ifn-g (a receptormediated activator) and pma (a direct pkc activator) to
stimulate ros production as positive controls and, after treatment with bay 41-2272, to test its potential for priming cells.
we observed that bay 41-2272 induced a marked increase in
superoxide production, which may be related to pkc stimulation of the sgc–cgmp signalling pathway (khare et al.,
1994; aggelidou et al., 2002). pkc promotes ‘phagocyte
oxidase’ phosphorylation and activation of the nadph
oxidase system (ueyama et al., 2007). moreover, activation of
pkc may explain the high response after just 2 h of treatment, since an increase in gene expression after this short
time is not likely to occur for most genes, including the
nadph oxidase-related genes and proteins (newburger et al.,
1988).
as extensively described, activation of the nadph
oxidase system involves phosphorylation and clustering of
proteins in membranes, but the maintenance of the response
depends on the expression of new nadph oxidase components (quinn et al., 2006). our results show that bay 41-2272
markedly increases in the expression of cybb and  xxxg1509xxx .
moreover, the protein expression of the nadph oxidase components ( xxxg1509xxx  and gp91phox) was also increased, confirm-

ing the data obtained by qrt-pcr. these results are similar to
those found by newburger et al. (1991), who showed an
increase in the expression of these genes by up to 12 times
after 24 h incubation of pbm with ifn-g and also, similarly,
condino-neto et al. (1998) found that ifn-g increased the
expression of cybb in thp-1 cells. these results suggest that
bay 41-2272 stimulates not only signalling pathways but also
important transcriptional factors related to the expression of
cybb and  xxxg1509xxx  genes, such as stab1, cdp (hawkins et al.,
2001) and pbx1, constitutively expressed in thp-1 (skalnik
and neufeld, 1992; eklund et al., 2000); haf-1 (newburger
et al., 1994; suzuki et al., 1998); and pu.1/irf1/icsbp/cbp
(eklund and kakar, 1999). recently, luengo-blanco et al.
(2008) reported that binding of  xxxg1559xxx  transcription factor to
cybb is important for napdh oxidase function. since there
was a marked increased production of  xxxg2296xxx , which is dependent on  xxxg1559xxx  activation (ci et al., 2008), we suggest that bay
41-2272 may activate the signalling pathways involved in
 xxxg1559xxx  activation.
in addition to ros release, phagocytosis is an essential
function that should be analysed in phagocytes. signal pathways activated by bay 41-2272 are involved in cgmp generation and are linked to morphological changes required for
migration, phagocytosis and spreading (borán and garcía,
2007). we showed that bay 41-2272 increased phagocytosis

bay 41-2272 increases microbicidal activity of thp-1 cells and pbm. pretreatment of thp-1 (a) and pbm (b) (1 ¥ 106 cells· xxxg1167xxx ) with bay 41-2272
(1.0 or 3.0 mm) for 48 h increased their microbicidal activity against epec, assessed by cfu counting from recovering internalized bacteria after
co-culture. as positive control, cells were treated with ifn-g (100 u· xxxg1167xxx ) for 48 h. microbicidal activity is expressed as percentage ⫾ sem of
maximum killing (minimum bacterial survival) (n = 6 healthy volunteers, in triplicate for pbm, n = 6 independent experiments, in triplicate for
thp-1). *p < 0.05, compared with basal bacterial activity; **p < 0.05, compared with cells in same treatment condition, cultured with bacteria
opsonized or not, by two-way anova followed by bonferroni test.

and this can be explained by pkg activation, as this was
recently shown by bóran et al. (2008) to promote a rapid
release and expansion of filaments in microglia cells and
increase in the phagocytosis function after treatment with
anp (another sgc stimulator) and dibutyryl-cgmp (permeable analogue of cgmp).
the phagocytosis activity and oxidative burst by mononuclear phagocytes have been kinetically correlated with
increased bactericidal activity. it is recognized that ros are
highly toxic to bacteria such as e. coli (nauseef, 2007),
and this increase is probably related to the amount of oxidative burst and phagocytosis. however, other important
parameters such as acidification of phagosome ph and release
of lysosomal enzymes and granules (ismail et al., 2002) have
not yet been evaluated. therefore, we cannot exclude a possible involvement of other factors such as the expression of
surface molecules like fc and complement receptors, making
the phagocytosis more efficient and generating other signals
that increase the phagocyte killing (jongstra-bilen et al.,
2003; luo et al., 2006; rhein et al., 2008).

all these effects may be related to cytokine production
involved with cellular activation and enhancement of the
immune response. according to our expectations, treatment
with bay 41-2272 generated an increase in il-12p70 release,
since activated monocytes and macrophages produced high
levels of these cytokines (murray et al., 2006). bay 41-2272
also promoted an increased production of  xxxg2296xxx , strongly
suggesting that this drug can activate mapks or  xxxg1559xxx  signalling pathways (igbal and zaidi, 2008). in addition,  xxxg2296xxx 
production is thought to act like an autocrine, signalling cell
activation by acting on the  xxxg2296xxx  receptor in monocyte cells
(deering and orange, 2006).
since we observed a wide spectrum of functions activated in treated phagocytes, we wondered whether all
these effects of bay 41-2272 resulted from an effect involving the sgc cyclase pathway. we observed that treatment
with odq, a sgc specific inhibitor, did not result in a significant reduction of bay 41-2272-induced superoxide production and phagocytosis. these results show that the
effects of the compound are not related only to the sgc

cyclase pathway, presenting activity on other signalling
pathways.
oliveira-junior et al. (2007) showed that bay 41-2272 is
able to generate an increased production of camp, another
important second messenger. based on this, we suggest that
other important pathways are activated by this compound.
this increased production of camp could be due to a direct
effect of the drug on the enzyme adenylate cyclase or an
indirect effect through the production of cgmp. in addition
to this hypothesis, derbyshire et al. (2009) showed that the
catalytic domains of gcs contain a catalytic and allosteric site
capable of binding to both gtp and atp nucleotides. this
same group showed that the action of yc-1, a bay 41-2272
analogue, leads to the production of cgmp and camp. this
another alternative action of the drug, beyond the pathway
involving sgc–cgmp–pkg.
based on our results using odq and the results found
by koglin et al. (2002), showing bay 41-2272 binding

sites at two isoforms of sgc, we started to perform an
in silico analysis of proteins with potential binding sites
for bay 41-2272. in our initial analysis, we found four
proteins with potential binding sites for this compound
and functions related to differentiation/activation of
myelomonocytic cells (data not shown). these results open
a new way of thinking for bay 41-2272 analysis and new
pathways involved in the activation of human myelomonocytic cells.
in summary, our present study consistently demonstrated
that bay 41-2272 activates human mononuclear phagocytes
and has a great potential to control infections. however, the
cardiovascular effects of bay 41-2272 limit its clinical application, and this should be addressed in future in in vivo
experimental and pre-clinical studies. moreover, additional
studies to clarify the signalling pathways involved in phagocyte activation will help to elucidate and modulate the effects
of bay 41-2272 both in the cardiovascular and immune
