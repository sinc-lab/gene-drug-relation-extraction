abstract

background:  xxxd2149xxx  is a novel antithrombotic agent, the first of
a new class of selective  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors. it has favourable pharmacokinetics
including 100% bioavailability, low variability and a mean terminal half-life of
17 hours for young and 21 hours for elderly healthy volunteers, enabling oncedaily administration. studies on the prevention of venous thromboembolism
(vte) after orthopaedic surgery demonstrated significantly improved efficacy
over the  xxxd1997xxx  enoxaparin, with a >50% reduced risk of
vte and a similar safety profile.
objective: to investigate the in vitro binding of  xxxd2149xxx  to purified
 xxxg2056xxx  ( xxxg2056xxx ) and other plasma proteins.
methods:  xxxd2149xxx  was incubated with human plasma, antithrombin-depleted plasma or purified human plasma proteins, including antithrombin, alpha1-acid glycoprotein,  xxxg124xxx  and immunoglobulin.
non-protein-bound  xxxd2149xxx  was determined using a validated
chromogenic assay method, enabling the calculation of the free fraction of
 xxxd2149xxx  and its binding parameters.
results: at steady state,  xxxd2149xxx  at therapeutic concentrations [i.e.
those attainable in the prevention (0.14 to 0.50 mg/l) and treatment (up to approximately 2 mg/l) of vte] was extensively bound (>97%) to plasma proteins
and specifically bound (>94%) to purified  xxxg2056xxx . the specific binding parameters
bmax (binding capacity) and kd (dissociation constant) were similar for human
plasma (bmax = 2072 nmol/l, kd = 28 nmol/l) and purified  xxxg2056xxx  (bmax = 1627
nmol/l and kd = 32 nmol/l). there was no specific binding of fondaparinux
sodium to other purified plasma proteins.
conclusion: at clinically relevant concentrations,  xxxd2149xxx  is highly
and specifically bound to  xxxg2056xxx  in human plasma, suggesting that potential interaction with drugs via albumin or alpha1-acid glycoprotein displacement is unlikely.

introduction
 xxxd2149xxx  is a highly novel antithrombotic agent, the result of a rational design
initiative for a selective inhibitor of  xxxg741xxx .
 xxxd2149xxx  is a single chemical entity;
it does not exist in nature and is manufactured entirely by chemical synthesis. it reversibly binds
with high affinity to  xxxg2056xxx  ( xxxg2056xxx ) to
catalyse  xxxg2056xxx -mediated inhibition of  xxxg741xxx ,
and consequently inhibits the production of thrombin, a key component in the blood clotting process
(figure 1).[1-4]
established treatments for the prevention of
thrombosis following surgery include unfractionated heparin (ufh) and the low-molecularweight heparins (lmwhs). heparins are a complex mixture of molecules containing various
anionic groups which provide the potential to bind
to large numbers of blood proteins.[5] binding to
proteins other than those targeted may result in
drug-drug interactions and undesirable adverse effects. one of these significant interactions is binding with  xxxg1726xxx , which may result in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (hit).[6] lmwhs
demonstrate improved efficacy and safety com-

molecule

pared with ufh, although in some studies the
risk of hit is not eliminated.[7-9] additionally,
lmwhs provide improved bioavailability compared with ufh and therefore do not require monitoring in most clinical situations. the need for an
improved risk/benefit ratio in antithrombotic therapy provided a rationale to design and develop new
synthetic and selective agents such as  xxxd2149xxx .[1,3,4]
in clinical studies,  xxxd2149xxx  was
reported to be rapidly and completely absorbed:
the maximum plasma concentration (cmax) was
reached between 1 and 3 hours and bioavailability
was 100% by the subcutaneous route.[10] there was
limited distribution volume, no evidence of metabolism of the drug and the pharmacokinetics were
linear in the range 2 to 8mg. steady state was
reached after 3 to 4 days’ treatment, and the terminal mean half-life was between 17 and 21 hours,
optimal for once-daily administration.[4,11] a large
phase ii dose-ranging study demonstrated a clear
potential benefit over lmwhs and indicated that
the 2.5mg once-daily dose should be selected for
further clinical trials in the prevention of venous
thromboembolism in patients undergoing major

 xxxd2149xxx  specific protein binding

orthopaedic surgery of the lower limbs.[12]
 xxxd2149xxx  2.5mg once daily was evaluated in phase iii clinical trials for prophylactic
use in the prevention of venous thromboembolism
following orthopaedic surgery.[13-17] this programme included more than 7000 patients and
showed an important benefit in terms of efficacy
of  xxxd2149xxx  over lmwh with a similar safety profile. a dose of 2.5mg fondaparinux
sodium once daily is approved for use in this
indication.
in this study, in vitro binding of fondaparinux
sodium to antithrombin was investigated and compared with other human plasma proteins, including alpha1-acid glycoprotein, immunoglobulin or  xxxg124xxx , in the presence of whole or
 xxxg2056xxx -depleted plasma or in pure solution. in addition, the binding parameters of fondaparinux
sodium to antithrombin were determined to investigate its highly specific mode of action and the
advantages this may confer in clinical use.
methods
binding experiments were performed in human
plasma (centre regional de la transfusion du
languedoc) or antithrombin-deficient plasma
(american diagnostica, andresy, france; and
stago, asnières, france), both of which were
spiked with  xxxd2149xxx . alternatively,
binding with purified proteins was performed in
phosphate-buffered saline (pbs, seromed, berlin,
germany). the purified proteins included human
antithrombin (chromogenix, milan, italy), human
alpha1-acid glycoprotein, human  xxxg124xxx  and
human immunoglobulin (sigma-aldrich, saintquentin fallavier, france) . at least three replicates of each protein in pbs or protein/plasma
mixture were incubated with  xxxd2149xxx 
concentrations in the range 0.5 to 50 mg/l at 37°c
for at least 30 minutes. this was considered sufficient time to allow the binding reaction to reach
completion. protein concentrations used in the different assays are given in table i. these concentrations correspond to the normal plasma levels as
previously described.[18,19]

following binding, the mixtures were separated
into protein and nonprotein fractions by ultrafiltration using centricon ym-10 devices (millipore)
with a membrane providing a 10 000d cut-off.
these devices were found to give lower mean
deviations in terms of recovery of fondaparinux
sodium from human plasma than devices with
30 000d molecular weight cut-off membranes,
and no significant antithrombin concentration was
found in the ultrafiltrate after filtration of antithrombin in pbs with 10 000d membrane devices.
as a consequence, the ym-10 devices were selected for use in this study. centrifugation was carried out in a fixed angle rotor; parameters were
varied according to the samples (table i). for each
replicate, 2ml of sample was centrifuged in order
to recover 250 ± 50mul of ultrafiltrate. each part of
the ultrafiltration device was weighed before and
after centrifugation to monitor the precise volumes
of each fraction.
concentrations of  xxxd2149xxx  (expressed as acid with a molecular mass of 1504d)
in spiked samples, concentrates and ultrafiltrates
(or plasma water when plasma was used) were determined using an automated assay system
(stachrom® heparin cat no. 00906 and sta® automate from stago). this assay was previously
validated (unpublished data, sanofi-synthelabo)
according to established validation protocols.[20]
the principle of this assay is that the concentration

of drug is proportional to inhibition of  xxxg741xxx ,
the activity of which is monitored by the extent of
hydrolysis of a chromogenic substrate (paranitroaniline-derived peptide, stachrom). the initial velocity of the enzymatic activity of residual factor
xa was automatically determined (one measure every 2 seconds, for a 10- to 40-second interval) at
405nm. although the drug is referred to as
 xxxd2149xxx  in this paper, the concentrations, as determined by the assays, are expressed
in equivalents of the free acid form of the drug (i.e.
fondaparinux). protein concentrations in the fractions following ultrafiltration were determined using the bca protein assay kit (pierce chemical
co., rockford il, usa) according to the
microwell plate protocol. the range of calibration
for this assay in ultrafiltrate was 4.2 to 84 mug/l; the
limit of quantification in plasma was 4.2 mug/l.
protein-bound  xxxd2149xxx  was calculated using the equation:

treated patients at 2.5mg (minimum 0.14 to 0.19
mg/l, peak 0.39 to 0.50 mg/l) and in patients
treated at 10mg for venous thromboembolism (up
to approximately 2 mg/l), more than 95% of
 xxxd2149xxx  was specifically bound to human  xxxg2056xxx . at higher, non-clinically relevant concentrations (3.0 to 50 mg/l) there was a concentration-dependent decrease in the bound fraction with
purified antithrombin up to approximately 30%,
while with human plasma the bound fraction remained at approximately 80%. the difference in
binding between the two matrices was indicative
of nonspecific binding to proteins other than antithrombin in human plasma.
the calculated specific binding component of
 xxxd2149xxx  in human plasma and in purified antithrombin is shown in figure 3. as suggested by the underlying model, the plots for spe-

cific binding in both matrices showed a saturable
process. furthermore, they were very similar and
consistent with a specific binding of fondaparinux
sodium to  xxxg2056xxx  in plasma.
the calculated parameters for the specific
 xxxd2149xxx  binding component to human plasma and human purified antithrombin are

given in table ii. these parameters were calculated
on the basis of a weighted one-site-binding model
with a nonspecific component. the bmax and kd
were similar under these two conditions, indicating similar specific binding in both mixtures. nonspecific binding, however, was of much greater
magnitude in human plasma than in purified human antithrombin as shown by pns and nsb parameters (table ii).
scatchard plots for the concentration of
 xxxd2149xxx  bound versus bound/free for
binding in a solution of human purified antithrombin and in human plasma are given in figure
4. the mostly linear form of this plot towards the
x axis indicated that the drug binds to only a single
site on the antithrombin molecule. the slight curve
at higher  xxxd2149xxx  bound levels indicated an additional nonspecific binding component. the intersect of the extrapolated scatchard
plot with the x axis gave a bmax value consistent
with the calculated value given in table ii. the kd
is given by –1/slope of this line.
 xxxd2149xxx  binding to other purified
proteins ( xxxg124xxx , alpha1-acid glycoprotein
and alpha1 gamma-globulin) and in antithrombin-depleted
plasma is shown in figure 5. since the binding to
these purified proteins remained constant irrespective of  xxxd2149xxx  concentration, it is
concluded that the binding of  xxxd2149xxx  to these proteins is nonspecific. in antithrombin-depleted plasma the bound fraction was
constant, did not decrease with increasing
 xxxd2149xxx  concentration and approxi-

discussion
in this study, at clinically relevant concentrations,  xxxd2149xxx  was highly and specifically bound almost solely to human  xxxg2056xxx  protein.
this is supported by the finding that the specific
binding parameters of  xxxd2149xxx  in
plasma and purified antithrombin were similar. as
the drug concentration increased, there was a concentration-dependent decrease in protein binding,
which is consistent with a saturable process of its
receptor.  xxxd2149xxx  was shown to bind
specifically to human plasma and purified human
 xxxg2056xxx , but did not specifically bind to different human purified proteins usually involved in the binding of drugs (albumin and alpha1-acid glycoprotein).
this predicts that  xxxd2149xxx  is unlikely

to interact with concomitantly administered drugs
by a protein displacement mechanism. the binding
of  xxxd2149xxx  to the different biological
matrices tested was shown to be nonspecific.
because of the specific mode of action of
 xxxd2149xxx , the pharmacologically active moiety is the  xxxg2056xxx -bound fraction, which is
almost the total protein-bound fraction for concentrations below 2 mg/l, whereas the free fraction is
inactive. this is contrary to many other medications, where most of the protein-bound drug is unavailable for activity at its site of action and only
the free fraction is considered active. therefore,
high protein binding is normally considered to
have a negative effect on drug efficacy, whereas in
the case of  xxxd2149xxx , specific and high
protein binding is considered beneficial.
on the basis of the results of the present
study, the receptor concentration of  xxxd2149xxx  in plasma is estimated to be
128 ± 12 mg/l. this is consistent with the antithrombin concentration in human plasma, which
has previously been estimated to be 150 mg/l
(2.57 mumol).[21] the kd with purified antithrombin

 xxxd2149xxx  specific protein binding

was reported as 41 ± 8 nmol/l when measured
by fluorescence quenching.[2] this level is consistent with the results in plasma or purified antithrombin reported here.
the specific binding of  xxxd2149xxx  to
 xxxg2056xxx  and some of the binding parameters determined in this study are consistent with findings of
a previous in vitro study. this binding is much
more specific than the binding observed with heparin: in a mechanism of action study, comparisons
of the binding of  xxxd2149xxx  and binding
of a full length heparin of approximately 26
saccharides to antithrombin showed kd values of
36 ± 11 and 10 ± 3 nmol, respectively.[22]
the in vitro results in this study provide further
evidence that  xxxd2149xxx , by specifically binding to  xxxg2056xxx , has a unique mode of action
that may partly explain its important clinical benefits.  xxxd2149xxx  has been shown to
bind more specifically to  xxxg2056xxx  than heparin and
lmwh.  xxxd2149xxx  has also been
shown to lack anti-iia activity in vivo, unlike heparin and lmwh, which further supports its specificity of action.[23]
the lack of binding to proteins other than  xxxg2056xxx 
indicates that interaction with other drugs by
competition for protein binding is unlikely.  xxxd2149xxx  therefore represents an important
advance that may translate into clinical advantages
over existing treatments for the prevention of
venous thromboembolism and other thrombotic
conditions.
