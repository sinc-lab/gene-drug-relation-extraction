abstract
the identification of new molecular components of the
dna damage signaling cascade opens novel avenues
to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs.
high-mobility group protein 1 ( xxxg1059xxx ) is a dna damage
sensor responsive to the incorporation of nonnatural nucleosides into dna; several nuclear and cytosolic proteins
are functionally integrated with  xxxg1059xxx  in the context of
dna damage response. the functional role of  xxxg1059xxx  and
 xxxg1059xxx -associated proteins (high-mobility group protein
b2, hmgb2;  xxxg861xxx ,
 xxxg861xxx ; protein disulfide isomerase family a member 3,
pdia3; and  xxxg1102xxx ,  xxxg1102xxx ) in
dna damage response was assessed in human carcinoma
cells a549 and uo31 by transient knockdown with short
interfering rnas. using the cell proliferation assay, we
found that knockdown of  xxxg1059xxx -associated proteins resulted in 8-fold to 50-fold decreased chemosensitivity of
a549 cells to  xxxd1790xxx . western blot analysis and immunofluorescent microscopy were used to evaluate genotoxic stress markers in knocked-down cancer cells after
24 to 72 hours of incubation with 1 mumol/l of  xxxd1790xxx .
our results dissect the roles of  xxxg1059xxx -associated proteins in dna damage response:  xxxg1059xxx  and hmgb2
facilitate p53 phosphorylation after exposure to genotoxic stress, and pdia3 has been found essential for
 xxxg1009xxx  phosphorylation (no gamma- xxxg1009xxx  accumulated after
24–72 hours of incubation with 1 mumol/l of  xxxd1790xxx 
in pdia3 knockdown cells). we conclude that phosphorylation of p53 and phosphorylation of  xxxg1009xxx  occur in
two distinct branches of the dna damage response.

the dna damage signaling cascade and provide novel
promising targets for chemotherapeutic intervention.

introduction
traditional chemotherapeutic agents targeted against dna
remain the core of anticancer therapy, and several million
people worldwide receive conventional chemotherapeutics
yearly (1). the efficacy of these drugs is limited partly because of cellular mechanisms that diminish dna damage
by executing cell cycle arrest and dna repair (2).
high-mobility group protein b1 ( xxxg1059xxx ) is an architectural transcription factor, and a component of the early
dna damage sensor responsive to the incorporation of
nonnatural nucleosides into dna that occurs without compromising dna integrity (3–5).  xxxg1059xxx  binds flexible dna
(prone to acquire bent or kinked conformation), rather than
dna with single-stranded or double-stranded breaks, and
recruits other proteins to the dna- xxxg1059xxx  complex (3).
in murine embryonic fibroblasts, knockout of  xxxg1059xxx  decreased sensitivity to antimetabolites 5-fold to 10-fold, and
inhibited the activation of p53-mediated response to genotoxic stress (5).
initial identification of  xxxg1059xxx  as a dna damage–sensing protein revealed a group of proteins (high-mobility
group protein b2, hmgb2;  xxxg861xxx ,  xxxg861xxx ; protein disulfide isomerase family
a, member 3, pdia3; and  xxxg1102xxx ,
 xxxg1102xxx ) which were physically associated with  xxxg1059xxx 
(4). although hmgb2 is a structural analogue of  xxxg1059xxx 
with amino acid sequence >85% identical to that of  xxxg1059xxx ,
knockout of this protein in mice confers a phenotype quite
distinct from that of  xxxg1059xxx -knockout mice (6). the role of
hmgb2 in dna damage stress response remained uncharacterized. cytosolic proteins  xxxg861xxx  and pdia3 have been
recently recognized to have intranuclear functions, and now
are the focus of intensive studies (7, 8). intranuclear localization and molecular partners of pdia3 (also known as
 xxxg323xxx , erp57, or grp58) suggests its participation in
dna repair processes (8, 9). finally,  xxxg1102xxx  (also known
as  xxxg1102xxx ) is a molecular chaperone involved in intranuclear translocation of cytosolic proteins. in response to different types of stress, including heat shock and oxidative
stress,  xxxg1102xxx  accumulates in the nucleolus, although its
functions still remain to be elucidated (10, 11).
recently, novel inhibitors of the cellular mechanisms responsive to dna damage have been developed and entered
into clinical trials (12, 13). within this approach, the cellular
components involved in the activation of chemotherapyinduced dna damage response provide important targets
because inhibition of checkpoints that regulate cell division
and limit dna damage can potentiate the efficiency of

chemotherapy. this is especially true with respect to antimetabolite drugs known to incorporate into dna without
gross changes of the dna structure (14, 15).
the primary focus of our study is to test the hypothesis that
 xxxg1059xxx  and associated proteins are involved in cellular response to antimetabolite drugs. multiple publications have
shown that antimetabolite treatment induced p53-mediated
apoptotic death of cells via genotoxic stress, although the beginning of this pathway remains obscure. in the present study,
we set out to characterize the functional role of  xxxg1059xxx -associated proteins in the early steps of dna damage response to
chemotherapeutic agents, at the cellular level. to this end, we
used a model system based on human carcinoma cells in
which individual proteins including  xxxg1059xxx , hmgb2,
 xxxg861xxx , pdia3, and  xxxg1102xxx  were knocked down by short
interfering rna (sirna) treatment. our studies showed that
the homologous proteins  xxxg1059xxx  and hmgb2 participate in
dna damage response by modulating p53 phosphorylation.
we also found that, after chemotherapy-induced stress, the
cytosolic proteins pdia3 and  xxxg1102xxx  accumulate in the nucleus; importantly, our data indicate that intranuclear pdia3
modulates the phosphorylation of  xxxg1009xxx  histone.
therefore, for the first time, we showed the functional
role of  xxxg1059xxx -associated proteins  xxxg1059xxx , hmgb2, and
pdia3 in chemotherapy-induced dna damage stress response in human cancer cells. together, these findings identify molecular components of the dna damage signaling
cascade and provide novel promising targets for chemotherapeutic intervention.

materials and methods
cell cultures, drug treatment, and plasmids
lung carcinoma cells a549 were obtained from the american type culture collection, and renal carcinoma uo31
cells were obtained from the tumor cell line repository,
nci-frederick. cells were treated with drugs dissolved in
dmso (fluorouracil), 0.1 n naoh ( xxxd2573xxx ), or water ( xxxd1790xxx ) as 500× to 1,000× stock solutions; drug concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically
(fluorouracil, epsilon265 = 7,010;  xxxd2573xxx , epsilon320 = 19,600;  xxxd1790xxx , epsilon272 = 9,259; ref. 16). [5-3h] xxxd1790xxx  (14.9 ci/mmol; moravek biochemicals) was
used in dna incorporation experiments. the ic50 values
were calculated by fitting a sigmoid emax model to the cell
viability versus drug concentration data, determined in triplicate from three independent experiments.
cell growth and viability
cell viability and cell count were determined by flow cytometry using viacount reagent with guava personal cell
analyzer (guava technologies). clonogenic assay was done
after cell treatment for 3 d, cell growth for 10 d, and staining
with  xxxd2610xxx  (17). for the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (mtt) assay (celltiter 96 cell
proliferation kit; promega), a549 and uo31 cells (250
cells/well) were plated into 96-well plates, and cultured
for 3 to 5 d in varying concentrations of the following drugs:
0 to 100 mumol/l of  xxxd2573xxx , 0 to 50 mumol/l of  xxxd1790xxx , and 0 to 100 mumol/l of fluorouracil.

rna interference with short duplex rna
rna interference experiments were done using the predesigned stealth rna (invitrogen;  xxxg1059xxx —hss142453,
hss142454, hss142455; hmgb2—hss104854,
hss104855, hss104856;  xxxg861xxx  validated stealth rnai
duopak duplexes 1 and 2; pdia3—hss142315,
hss142316, hss142317; and  xxxg1102xxx —hss105082,
hss105083, hss105084). effective sirna were selected using a lac-z reporter system (block-it rnai target
screening system; invitrogen). scrambled negative stealth
rnai control (invitrogen) was used as a negative control
in all sirna experiments.
analysis of mrna expression by real-time pcr
total cellular rna was extracted with trireagent (life
technologies/invitrogen) from a549 and uo31 cells (∼5 ×
106 cells per experiment, three replicates), reverse transcribed using the taqman reverse transcription kit (applied biosystems) according to the instructions of the
manufacturer. the level of mrna was evaluated using relative quantification protocol with human  xxxg53xxx  as a normalization standard on abi 7300 real-time pcr instrument
(applied biosystems) according to the instructions of the
manufacturer. data were collected from three independent
experiments for each sample.
western analysis was done as described earlier (4). the
subcellular fractionation into cytosolic and nuclear fractions was done using ne-per extraction reagent (pierce
biotechnology) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. the protein concentration was determined in
cellular extracts using plusone 2d quant kit (amersham
biosciences). electrophoretic separation was done using
16% page gels for analysis of gamma- xxxg1009xxx ,  xxxg1059xxx , and
hmgb2; 12% page gels for analysis of phosphorylated
p53; and gradient 4% to 12% page gels for analysis of
parp, pdia3, and  xxxg1102xxx  (pagegel). membranes were
developed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific to
 xxxg1059xxx  at 1:1,000 dilution and hmgb2 at 1:500 dilution
(abcam); rat anti- xxxg1102xxx  monoclonal antibody at 1:5,000
dilution (stressgen); rabbit anti- xxxg861xxx  polyclonal antibody at 1:10,000 dilution (santa cruz biotechnology);
rabbit anti-pdia3 polyclonal antibody (rockland) were
generated as described earlier and used at 1:5,000 dilution (4); rabbit anti–ser15 phosphorylated p53 polyclonal
antibody at 1:1,000 dilution and rabbit anti–gamma- xxxg1009xxx 
( xxxg1009xxx  phosphorylated at ser139) polyclonal antibody at
1:500 dilution (calbiochem); rabbit anti-parp polyclonal
antibody at 1:1,000 dilution (cell signaling technology);
rabbit anti–85 kda parp fragment polyclonal antibody
at 1:500 dilution (abcam); and mouse anti– xxxg53xxx  monoclonal antibody (loading control) at 1:10,000 dilution (sigma).
bands were visualized with secondary antibody—irdye680
donkey anti-mouse antibody and irdye680 goat antirabbit antibody; or irdye 800cw donkey anti-rabbit
antibody (li-cor biosciences) and irdye 800cw goat
anti-rat antibody (rockland) at 1:10,000 dilution and quantified by odyssey infrared imaging system (li-cor biosciences) using two-color fluorescence detection at 700 and
800 nm.

866 sensors of chemotherapy-induced dna damage

immunofluorescent microscopy
cells were grown on bd biocoat poly-l-lysine precoated
glass coverslips (thermo fisher scientific) in 12-well plates
at a density of 50,000 cells/well, treated with 10 mumol/l of
 xxxd1790xxx  for 48 h and fixed in 4% formaldehyde in pbs
for 15 min. cells were then washed in ice-cold methanol,
blocked in 5% normal rabbit serum, and labeled with
anti–gamma- xxxg1009xxx  antibody (phosphorylated  xxxg1009xxx 
rabbit monoclonal antibody conjugated with alexa fluor
488; cell signaling technology). the slides were incubated
with anti–phosphorylated  xxxg1009xxx  antibody (1:10
dilution) overnight at 4°c. nuclei were counterstained
with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole and mounted with
vectashield hard set mounting medium (vector laboratories). fluorescence images were recorded with a nikon
eclipse 50 fluorescent microscope and analyzed by imagej
1.37v software (nih). all experiments were repeated at
least four times. at least 100 cells were analyzed in each
experiment.
caspase activation
a549 and uo31 cells were grown in 96-well plates in
ham's f12k or rpmi 1640 and treated with 10 mumol/l of
fluorouracil, 10 mumol/l of  xxxd2573xxx , or 0.5 mumol/l
of  xxxd1790xxx  for 24 to 48 h.  xxxd1800xxx  (0.5 mug/ml)
was used as a positive control. caspase activity was assessed
using fluorogenic substrates for  xxxg341xxx  and caspase 7 using apo-one homogenous  xxxg341xxx /7 assay, according
to the instructions of the manufacturer (promega). caspase
activity was normalized per milligram of total protein, and
compared with activity in nontreated cells. each experiment
was done in triplicate and repeated at least thrice.
statistical analysis
the statistical analyses were carried out using student's
t test with statistica software program (statsoft), and nonlinear regression analysis with graphpad prism 4.0 software
(graphpad software). p < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. data are presented as the mean ± se.

results
antimetabolite treatment decreases cell proliferation
and clonogenic survival in carcinoma cells a549 and
uo31
two human carcinoma cell lines (lung carcinoma a549
and renal carcinoma uo31) proficient in p53-dependent
dna damage response pathway were selected as a model
system for the analysis of cellular response to antimetabolite
drugs (18). both cell lines were easily transfected with sirna,
and revealed effective knockdown of targeted proteins
within 24 to 48 hours (see below). to assess the chemosensitivity of the model cell lines, we used clonogenic and mtt
assays. although the clonogenic potential of a549 cells was
readily measured after drug treatment, uo31 cells did not
form colonies and were therefore excluded from clonogenic
assays. clonogenic survival of a549 was decreased following treatment with 0 to 50 mumol/l of  xxxd1790xxx , and 0 to
100 mumol/l of fluorouracil but not after 0 to 100 mumol/l of

 xxxd2573xxx  treatment;  xxxd1790xxx  was the most potent
cytotoxic agent for a549 cells (fig. 1a; table s1).1
furthermore, sensitivity of a549 and uo31 to antimetabolites was evaluated by the mtt assay indicative both of
cytotoxic and cytostatic effects (19). after 24 to 72 hours of
treatment with 0 to 100 mumol/l of fluorouracil, a549 and
uo31 cells showed decreased mtt reducing activity; both
cells were most sensitive to  xxxd1790xxx  treatment (fig. 1c;
table s1).1 similar to the results from clonogenic assays,
a549 was found to be resistant to  xxxd2573xxx  treatment
in the range 1 to 100 mumol/l (data not shown); uo31 was
sensitive to this drug (ic50 = 2.3 ± 0.55 mumol/l) indicating
that metabolic activation of  xxxd2573xxx  in uo31 cells is
functional.
antimetabolite treatment induces apoptosis in carcinoma cells a549 and uo31
activation of apoptosis in the a549 and uo31 cell lines
was tested after treatment with three antimetabolite drugs
( xxxd2573xxx , fluorouracil, and  xxxd1790xxx ) at concentrations 5 to 10 times higher than ic50. after treatment with 10
to 50 mumol/l of fluorouracil, we did not observe caspase
activation or parp proteolysis in either a549 or uo31 cells
(fig. 1b and d), although fluorouracil treatment had a
growth-inhibiting effect both on a549 and uo31 (results
not shown).  xxxd2573xxx  (10 mumol/l) was a weak inducer of apoptosis in uo31 (fig. 1d). treatment with  xxxd1790xxx  at concentrations 5 to 10 times above the ic50 values
induced apoptotic death in both cell lines after 48 hours of
incubation, as revealed by the activation of apoptotic markers (proteolysis of  xxxg341xxx  substrate parp; fig. 1b, and
2-fold to 4-fold induction of caspases 3/7 activity; fig. 1d).
because incorporation in dna is a major mechanism of  xxxd1790xxx  cytotoxicity, we verified the ability of both cell lines
to use  xxxd1790xxx  as a dna precursor. incorporation of  xxxd1790xxx  into dna was evaluated using [5-3h] xxxd1790xxx ;
these experiments confirmed that  xxxd1790xxx  was incorporated into the dna of both cell lines at comparable levels
(0.1–0.5%) and was already detectable after 24 hours of incubation (fig. s1).1 therefore, in further experiments, we
used  xxxd1790xxx  treatment to assess cytotoxic effects in
a549 and uo31 cells with knockdown proteins.
knockdown of  xxxg1059xxx -associated proteins using rna
interference
western blot analysis showed that both cell lines were
proficient in expressing  xxxg1059xxx , hmgb2,  xxxg861xxx , pdia3,
and  xxxg1102xxx  proteins (fig. 2a). to assess the role of hmgb1associated proteins in genotoxic stress response, we established a model system based on sirna technology. this
transient knockdown system made it possible to rapidly test
the functional role of five  xxxg1059xxx -associated proteins in response to genotoxic stress caused by nucleoside analogues.
the selection of an efficient sirna targeted against mrnas
coding for  xxxg1059xxx -associated proteins was done in an
a549 cell line using a sirna screening system; the efficiency of sirna-mediated mrna knockdown estimated by

real-time pcr was typically >90%. the changes in protein
level were monitored by western blot analysis. sirna that
reduced the protein level by >70% were selected for further
analysis. the following sirna were chosen for knockdown:
 xxxg1059xxx  (hss142453), hmgb2 (hss104854),  xxxg861xxx  (validated stealth rnai duopak duplex 1), pdia3 (hss142316),
and  xxxg1102xxx  (hss105082). the knockdown effect was evident during the entire experiment (24–72 hours; see fig.
s2). 1 interestingly, sirna knockdown was consistently
more effective in a549 cells (10–25% of residual protein)
compared with uo31 cells (25–40% of residual protein), as
evidenced by the lower levels of residual proteins (fig. 2a
and b). knockdown of  xxxg1059xxx /2, pdia, and  xxxg1102xxx  proteins in a549 and uo31 cells did not significantly change
the rate of cell growth compared with negative controls
(p > 0.05), whereas cell growth arrest was observed in cells
with knocked down  xxxg861xxx  (p < 0.004, table s2).1
knockdown of  xxxg1059xxx -associated proteins renders
cancer cell lines a549 and uo31 more resistant to
antimetabolites
according to our hypothesis,  xxxg1059xxx  and associated proteins act at the beginning of the genotoxic stress pathway.
we used an mtt assay to test the chemosensitivity of cancer
cell lines following knockdown of nuclear proteins associated with  xxxg1059xxx , to assess short-term effects generated by
the dna damage sensor (fig. 2c; table 1). in these experi-

ments, a five-orders of magnitude range of concentrations
of  xxxd1790xxx  was used to evaluate its inhibitory effect on
cell growth and viability. importantly, knockdown of
 xxxg1059xxx  and hmgb2 resulted in an 8-fold to 13-fold increase of ic50 in a549 cells treated with  xxxd1790xxx , and a
3-fold to 8-fold increase in uo31. similar to the effects of
 xxxg1059xxx /2, knockdown of pdia3 and  xxxg1102xxx  in a549 resulted in an 8-fold to 10-fold increase of ic50 (table 1). in
contrast, pdia3 and  xxxg1102xxx  knockdown in uo31 did not
alter cell viability (table 1). although the levels of these proteins were reduced to 10% to 20% in a549 cells, in uo31,
the residual levels were ∼30% to 40% (fig. 2b), providing
an explanation for the smaller difference in cytotoxic effects.
the strongest effect was achieved by knockdown of
 xxxg861xxx  (>50-fold increase of ic50; see fig. s3).1 because
 xxxg861xxx  knockdown caused cell growth arrest (table s2),1
we excluded sigapdh treatment from further cytotoxicity
experiments. therefore, in experiments on molecular markers of cytotoxicity, we used a549 and uo31 cells with
knockdown proteins  xxxg1059xxx , hmgb2, pdia3, and  xxxg1102xxx 
after treatment with  xxxd1790xxx .

by consecutive dilutions of  xxxd1790xxx  (0–50 mumol/l), and incubated for 3 d before collecting data. for all four sirna-treated cells, results were statistically
significantly different from the control cells transfected with scrambled sirna (p < 0.0025).

effects of knockdown of  xxxg1059xxx -associated proteins. after
transfection with sirna targeted against  xxxg1059xxx , hmgb2,
pdia3, and  xxxg1102xxx , both a549 and uo31 cells were treated
with 1 mumol/l of  xxxd1790xxx  for 24 to 72 hours, and cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting (fig. 3). accumulation of the ser15-phosphorylated form of p53 was already
notable after 24 hours of incubation in control cells (transfected with scrambled sirna), but it was delayed till 48 to
72 hours in cells with knocked down  xxxg1059xxx  and hmgb2,
corroborating the functional role of these proteins in cellular
response. knockdown of  xxxg1059xxx /2, which delayed the accumulation of the s15-p53 level, also slightly affected the formation of gamma- xxxg1009xxx  (fig. 3). importantly, accumulation of
ser15-phosphorylated p53 (fig. 3a and c) paralleled the accumulation of the 85 kda parp fragment, indicative of  xxxg341xxx  activation (fig. 4a and b). the most pronounced drop
in the accumulation of the 85 kda parp fragment was observed in cells with reduced  xxxg1102xxx  protein; this finding is
still awaiting explanation (fig. 4a and b).
western blot analysis of cytosolic and nuclear extracts
isolated from untreated a549 cells showed that pdia3
and  xxxg1102xxx  reside in the cytosol. these proteins relocate
into the nuclei after  xxxd1790xxx  treatment (fig. 5; fig. s4).1
figure 5b shows accumulation of pdia3 in the nucleus of
cells following incubation with 1 mumol/l of  xxxd1790xxx  for

24 to 72 hours. in a549/sipdia3 knockdown cells, the total
level of pdia3 was reduced by 90% (fig. 2b), and its accumulation in the nucleus of sipdia3-treated a549 cells in response to drug treatment was notable after 72 hours of

phosphorylated at ser15 (a and c),
and  xxxg1009xxx  phosphorylated at ser139
( b and d ). after transfection with
corresponding sirna, cells were incubated for 48 h, trypsinized, and
seeded at a density of 5,300 cells/
cm2. the next day, 1 mumol/l of  xxxd1790xxx  was added; nuclear extracts
were prepared at 0, 24, 48, and
72 h in the presence of protease and
protein phosphatase inhibitors, and
analyzed by western blot analysis under conditions indicated in materials
and methods. experiments were repeated three to four times, and quantification was done by scanning and
image analysis after incubation with
chromophore-labeled secondary antibody.  xxxg53xxx  was used as a loading
control. scrambled sirna was used
as negative control in all experiments.

interestingly, knockdown of pdia3 protein in a549 cells
inhibited the accumulation of gamma- xxxg1009xxx  following  xxxd1790xxx 
treatment (fig. 3b and d). under the same conditions, phosphorylation of ser 15 in p53 was already observed after
24 hours of incubation, indicating that phosphorylation of
p53 and  xxxg1009xxx  are independent events (fig. 3). to corroborate these data, we evaluated the formation of gamma- xxxg1009xxx  foci in
a549/sipdia3 cells treated with  xxxd1790xxx  by immunofluorescent microscopy (fig. 5a). cells treated with hydroxyurea
were used as positive controls (fig. s5;1 ref. 20). a significantly lower number of cells treated with  xxxd1790xxx  were stained
with anti–gamma- xxxg1009xxx  antibody when pdia3 protein was
knocked down (fig. 5a), consistent with the results of western blot analysis (fig. 3b and d). in parallel to inhibition of
 xxxg1009xxx  phosphorylation, accumulation of 85 kda parp fragment in the cells with knocked down pdia3 protein occurred

with a delay compared with control cells (fig. 4a and b). the
same effects were observed in uo31 cells after the knockdown of  xxxg1059xxx -associated proteins (data not shown).

discussion
the role of  xxxg1059xxx  in recognizing aberrant or damaged
dna has been shown in multiple in vitro experiments. a
recent study directly showed the accumulation of  xxxg1059xxx 
at sites of oxidative dna damage in live cells thus defining
 xxxg1059xxx  as a component of an early dna damage response
(21). reduced histone acetylation after dna damage in
 xxxg1059xxx -deficient cells indicates a role for  xxxg1059xxx  in dna
damage–induced chromatin remodeling (22). in the present
study, we established a model system based on human
carcinoma cells a549 and uo31, in which two groups of

figure 5. accumulation of gamma- xxxg1009xxx  in a549/sipdia3 cells after genotoxic stress. a, formation of gamma- xxxg1009xxx  foci following genotoxic stress.
a549 control cells (left) or a549/sipdia3 cells (right) were treated with
1 mumol/l of  xxxd1790xxx  for 48 h, fixed with formaldehyde and immunostained with anti–gamma- xxxg1009xxx  antibody conjugated with alexa fluor 488. after
the final wash, cells were counterstained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole and mounted on the slide as described in materials and methods.
hydroxyurea was used as a positive control for gamma- xxxg1009xxx  foci formation
(fig. s5).1 b, intranuclear accumulation of pdia3 in a549 control cells
and a549/sipdia3 cells. nuclei were isolated from 1 × 106 a549 cells
treated with scrambled sirna (left lanes) or sipdia3 (right lanes), challenged with 1 mumol/l of  xxxd1790xxx  for 48 h, and analyzed by western blot
analysis using a gradient 4% to 12% page gel.  xxxg53xxx  was used as a
loading control.

proteins—nuclear proteins ( xxxg1059xxx /2) and proteins transiently present in the nucleus after the drug stress ( xxxg861xxx ,
pdia3, and  xxxg1102xxx ) were knocked down with sirna. because  xxxd1790xxx  was the strongest inducer of apoptosis in
both cell lines, we used it to challenge cells following sirna
treatment. the cytotoxic effect of  xxxd1790xxx  is due to incorporation into dna and is mediated by p53 (12, 23). the  xxxd1790xxx  concentration for cell treatment (1 mumol/l
 xxxd1790xxx ) was selected to maximize the effect of the drug
at relatively short exposure periods (24–72 hours). this concentration lies within the range of  xxxd1790xxx  plasma concentrations achieved in some protocols for the treatment
of hematopoietic malignancies (24).
sirna treatment effectively decreased the level of proteins in both cell lines, although the residual levels of four
proteins ( xxxg1059xxx ,  xxxg861xxx , pdia3, and  xxxg1102xxx ) were consistently higher in uo31 cells compared with a549 cells
(fig. 2). the rate of proliferation of knockdown cells did
not change significantly, with the exception of cells treated
with sigapdh, in which this treatment arrested cell

growth. this was not unexpected, as  xxxg861xxx  is involved
in cell cycle regulation via interaction with cyclin b (25),
and/or s phase–inducible h2b transcription activator
oca-s (26). depletion of  xxxg861xxx  in a549 and uo31 cell
lines dramatically altered cell chemosensitivity (table 1;
fig. s3).1 because antimetabolite drugs exert their cytotoxic
effects during the s phase of the cell cycle, the unusually
strong effect of  xxxg861xxx  knockdown on cell viability is
probably the consequence of cell cycle arrest, a hypothesis
under investigation in our lab.
abrogation of  xxxg1059xxx  and hmgb2 increased chemoresistance both in a549 and uo31 cell lines (table 1;
fig. 2c). importantly, the effect of hmgb2 knockdown
was similar to that of  xxxg1059xxx  knockdown, despite the fact
that hmgb2 is a much less abundant protein than  xxxg1059xxx 
(fig. 2a). the results received after transient knockdown
of  xxxg1059xxx  in human cancer cells are in line with our
data obtained in  xxxg1059xxx -knockout murine embryonic
fibroblasts (5). the present study supports the role of chromatin-associated proteins  xxxg1059xxx /2 in early steps of druginduced activation of p53 response by demonstrating delay
or abrogation of the stress marker (phosphorylated form of
p53) in  xxxg1059xxx /2-depleted cells (fig. 3a and c). our results
indicate that  xxxg1059xxx  (and probably hmgb2) is a sensor of
dna damage which induces p53-mediated dna damage
response. in the cells with depleted  xxxg1059xxx , manifestation
of apoptosis markers (e.g., caspase-mediated parp proteolysis) is also delayed (fig. 4). active scanning for flexible
points within dna as a mechanism of dna damage detection provides an attractive explanation of how  xxxg1059xxx 
contributes to several seemingly unrelated dna repair pathways, including mismatch repair, base excision repair, and
nucleotide excision repair (21, 22, 27). of note, dna substrates of mismatch repair and base excision repair revealed
increased flexibility (28–30). although stimulation of dna
repair by  xxxg1059xxx  is shown reasonably well, the consequences of  xxxg1059xxx  depletion for the cells are less clear: no
change, decreased, and increased sensitivity to the a panel of
dna-damaging agents was reported in  xxxg1059xxx  knockout
murine embryonic fibroblasts (4, 5, 21, 22, 31). most interestingly,  xxxg1059xxx  physically and functionally interacts with
p53, indicating a link with p53-dependent signaling networks (32, 33). the intracellular level of  xxxg1059xxx  is controlled by developmental and tissue-specific factors, and
variations in  xxxg1059xxx  level may explain different sensitivities to chemotherapy in certain cell populations (34). in line
with this notion, analysis of gene expression in ovarian tumors indicated a potential association between  xxxg1059xxx  expression level and resistance to chemotherapy (35).
depletion of nuclear matrix–associated protein pdia3
significantly changed chemosensitivity to  xxxd1790xxx  treatment in a549 cell line. western blot analysis of nuclear extracts from a549 and uo31 cells and immunofluorescent
microscopy revealed that knockdown of pdia3 abrogated
the phosphorylation of  xxxg1009xxx  (figs. 3 and 5). importantly,
phosphorylation of the genotoxic marker  xxxg1009xxx  occurred
independently of p53 phosphorylation: in cells with knocked
down pdia3, phosphorylation of  xxxg1009xxx  was significantly

inhibited at 24, 48, and 72 hours, whereas phosphorylation
of ser15-p53 was not affected; this was already observed after 24 hours (fig. 3). phosphorylation of p53 and phosphorylation of  xxxg1009xxx  are not mutually dependent because
phosphorylation of p53 at ser18 (corresponding to ser15 in
human p53) and p53 stabilization were normal in  xxxg1009xxx −/−
murine embryonic fibroblasts and thymocytes after dna
damage, and phosphorylation of  xxxg1009xxx  was normal in the
human fibroblast cells with compromised p53 (36, 37). taken together with our observation that abrogation of pdia3
by rna interference inhibits phosphorylation of ser139 in
 xxxg1009xxx  but not ser15 in p53, these facts indicate that phosphorylation of p53 and  xxxg1009xxx  occur via independent mechanisms. although pdia3 is a member of the protein
disulfide isomerase family of proteins mainly present in
the endoplasmic reticulum, this protein was found to be associated with the internal nuclear matrix, and its dnabinding properties have been shown by dna-protein
cross-linking, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and cloning
of pdia3-bound dna (8, 38). moreover, pdia3 was shown
to cooperate with  xxxg171xxx , a protein involved in dna repair
which is a potent activator of p53 (9, 39). the abrogated
phosphorylation of  xxxg1009xxx  in pdia3-depleted cells allows
us to assume that pdia3 participates either in doublestrand break formation or  xxxg1009xxx  phosphorylation, the
hypotheses being investigated in our lab. accumulation of
gamma- xxxg1009xxx  is important in establishing a full dna damage
response (40); therefore, pdia3 could be an important molecular target for enhancing the efficacy of conventional
antimetabolite therapy. additional experiments are needed
to assess the exact roles of pdia3 and  xxxg1102xxx  in the
response to genotoxic stress.
in conclusion, our results, for the first time, show that
chromatin-associated  xxxg1059xxx , hmgb2, and matrix-associated protein pdia3 in cancer cells are important determinants of cellular response to antimetabolite drugs.
depletion of these proteins in human carcinoma cell lines
resulted in the alteration of cellular sensitivity to antimetabolite drugs, and changed manifestation of the cellular stress
markers. in this process, proteins have different functions:
 xxxg1059xxx  and hmgb2 facilitate p53 phosphorylation after
exposure to genotoxic stress; and pdia3 has been found
to be essential for  xxxg1009xxx  phosphorylation. hence, the phosphorylation of p53 and  xxxg1009xxx  occurs in two distinct
branches of the dna damage response. we hypothesize
that  xxxg1059xxx /2 proteins act as a sensor of dna modification, and their interaction with chemically altered dna
changes the chromatin structure, thus inducing dna damage response. elucidation of molecular components of the
cell responsive to chemotherapeutic agents will rationalize
the strategy for anticancer chemotherapy, and will define
molecular markers discriminating between therapeutic failure and success.
