abstract: salmeterol is a long-acting beta2-adrenergic receptor ( xxxg92xxx ) agonist used clinically to treat asthma.
in addition to binding at the active agonist site, it has been proposed that salmeterol also binds with very
high affinity at a second site, termed the “exosite”, and that this exosite contributes to the long duration
of action of salmeterol. to determine the position of the phenyl ring of the aralkyloxyalkyl side chain of
salmeterol in the  xxxg92xxx  binding site, we designed and synthesized the agonist photoaffinity label [125i]iodoazidosalmeterol ([125i]ias). in direct adenylyl cyclase activation, in effects on adenylyl cyclase after
pretreatment of intact cells, and in guinea pig tracheal relaxation assays, ias and the parent drug salmeterol
behave essentially the same. significantly, the photoreactive azide of ias is positioned on the phenyl
ring at the end of the molecule which is thought to be involved in exosite binding. carrier-free radioiodinated
[125i]ias was used to photolabel epitope-tagged human  xxxg92xxx  in membranes prepared from stably transfected
hek 293 cells. labeling with [125i]ias was blocked by 10 µm (-)- xxxd123xxx  and inhibited by addition
of gtpgammas, and [125i]ias migrated at the same position on an sds-page gel as the  xxxg92xxx  labeled by the
antagonist photoaffinity label [125i]iodoazidobenzylpindolol ([125i]iabp). the labeled receptor was purified
on a nickel affinity column and cleaved with  xxxg741xxx  protease at a specific sequence in the large loop
between transmembrane segments 5 and 6, yielding two peptides. while the control antagonist photoaffinity
label [125i]iabp labeled both the large  xxxg2296xxx  [containing transmembranes (tms) 1-5]
and the smaller c-terminal fragment (containing tms 6 and 7), essentially all of the [125i]ias labeling
was on the smaller c-terminal peptide containing tms 6 and 7. this direct biochemical evidence
demonstrates that when salmeterol binds to the receptor, its hydrophobic aryloxyalkyl tail is positioned
near tm 6 and/or tm 7. a model of ias binding to the  xxxg92xxx  is proposed.

the transmembrane (tm)1 domains of the beta2-adrenergic
receptor ( xxxg92xxx ) contain binding determinants for the interaction of antagonists and agonists. a coordinated interaction
of the catechol and amino groups of catecholamines with
side chains of amino acids in tm 5 (postulated to be ser
204 and ser 207) and tm 3 (asp 113) has been suggested
as the primary binding determinants for several n-aralkyl
derivatives of agonists and antagonists which bind with high
affinity to the  xxxg92xxx . one component of this interaction of
ligands in the  xxxg92xxx  binding site may involve molecules in
folded conformations, as suggested for the antagonist photolabel [125i]iodoazidobenzylpindolol ([125i]iabp) (1).

to exhibit unusually slow dissociation kinetics for dissociation
from the  xxxg92xxx  (2). the coupling efficiency of salmeterol
has indicated that it is a partial agonist with regard to  xxxg92xxx -mediated adenylyl cyclase activation in hek 293 cell
membranes which contain overexpressed human  xxxg92xxx  (3),
as well as in other systems. these studies demonstrated that
the extent of salmeterol-induced desensitization was greatly
reduced compared to that of epinephrine, which was consistent with partial agonist properties and prolonged activation of adenylyl cyclase (3, 4). it was also shown that
salmeterol binding to the active site was readily reversible
and competitive with  xxxg92xxx  ligands and displayed a kd of
1-2 nm (3, 5).
in addition to regular catechol binding interactions, it has
been proposed that salmeterol interacts at an additional site,
which has been termed the “exosite” (2). this model
proposes that salmeterol is tethered via its aryloxyalkyl side
chain to the exosite with extremely high affinity, and that
this site serves as an anchor to maintain salmeterol in the
binding site or close to the receptor, even after addition of
antagonist reverses the functional effects of salmeterol.
evidence in support of this was recently reported by green
et al. (5) and involved studies of  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg92xxx  chimeras.

[125i]ias photolabeling of the beta2-adrenergic receptor
suggested that a 10-amino acid sequence in putative tm 4
(amino acids 149-158) is involved in some fashion in
exosite binding of salmeterol on the  xxxg92xxx . an alternative
hypothesis (6) suggested that the quasi-irreversible properties
of the exosite could be due to the highly lipophilic character
of salmeterol (7, 8), and recent kinetic studies (9) may
support this proposal. the study of the molecular recognition
involved in exosite binding is of significant interest and may
lead to the design of additional g-protein-coupled receptor
ligands with long-acting properties.
in our studies, we have taken a direct biochemical
approach using photoaffinity labeling to investigate the
salmeterol binding site on human  xxxg92xxx . a unique synthetic
scheme for the synthesis of several derivatives of salmeterol
has been demonstrated on the basis of a newly devised
synthetic strategy (10). a novel agonist photoaffinity label,
[125i]iodoazidosalmeterol ([125i]ias), was developed in which
the photoactive azide group is positioned on the phenyl ring
at the end of the aralkyloxyalkyl chain, which is the part of
the salmeterol molecule that confers exosite binding properties. ias was tested to show that it retained the pharmacological properties of the parent drug, salmeterol. for human
 xxxg92xxx  expressed in hek 293 cells, ias showed similar direct
adenylyl cyclase activation and caused a similar effect on
adenylyl cyclase activity following drug pretreatment, as
salmeterol itself. the dose-response curves obtained for
relaxation of carbachol-contracted guinea pig trachea and
drug washout times are also similar for salmeterol and ias.
carrier-free [125i]ias has been synthesized and shown to
specifically label the  xxxg92xxx . labeling with [125i]ias was
blocked by 10 µm (-)- xxxd123xxx  and inhibited by addition
of gtpgammas and migrated at the same position on an sdspage gel as  xxxg92xxx  labeled with the antagonist photoaffinity
label [125i]iabp. labeled receptor was purified by nickel
affinity chromatography and cleaved with  xxxg741xxx  protease
at a specific sequence in the large loop between transmembrane segments 5 and 6, yielding two peptides. while the
control antagonist photoaffinity label [125i]iabp labeled both
the large  xxxg2296xxx  (containing tms 1-5) and
the smaller c-terminal fragment (containing tms 6 and 7),
essentially all of the [125i]ias labeling was on the smaller
c-terminal peptide. this direct biochemical evidence suggests that the salmeterol aryloxyalkyl side chain is on the
 xxxg92xxx  positioned near the region containing tm 6 and/or
tm 7.

radioiodination of 5 (ams). to 10 µl of 0.1 n naoh
were added 4 mci of na125i (2200 ci/mmol) in 20 µl of
0.1 n naoh and 30 µl of 0.1 n hcl, 60 µl of sodium

synthesis of [125i]ias 10. methanol containing the [125i]aminoiodosalmeterol 7 was evaporated with a nitrogen
stream, and 50 µl of 3 n acoh was quickly added to the
reaction vessel. the reaction mixture was cooled on ice for
15 min. sodium nitrite (5 µl, 0.1 m) was added, and the
mixture was cooled for an additional 20 min. sodium azide
(5 µl, 0.1 m) was added and the mixture left for 30 min at
0 °c. the reaction was stopped by adding 30 µl of
concentrated ammonium hydroxide and extracting with
chloroform (4 × 300 µl). the combined chloroform extract
was washed twice with brine, concentrated under a nitrogen
stream, and immediately dissolved in 30 µl of methanol.
the radioproduct, [125i]ias, exhibited a single spot which
comigrated with the previously characterized nonradioactive
compound 10 on a tlc plate.
membrane preparation, adenylyl cyclase activation assays, and intact cell pretreatment with salmeterol and ias.
membranes containing the human  xxxg92xxx  were prepared from
hek 293 cells stably transfected with double-epitope-tagged
receptor (n-terminal hemagglutinin or c-terminal hexahistidine) by homogenization and a sucrose step gradient as
previously described (4). membrane preparations contained
approximately 1-3 pmol of human  xxxg92xxx  per milligram of
membranes, as assessed by [125i]iodocyanopindolol binding.
assays for measuring the extent of adenylyl cyclase activation and the effect of pretreating cells with 10 nm salmeterol
or ias were also performed as previously described (4).
guinea pig trachea dose-response and drug washout
assays. albino female guinea pigs (o’brien hybrids,
brooklyn, wi) weighing 450-950 g were housed at the
school of veterinary medicine in accordance with guidelines
approved by the american association for accredited
laboratory animal care. guinea pigs were sacrificed using
sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) tracheas
were removed and cleaned of extraneous tissue while
immersed in a physiological salt solution (ph 7.4) with the
following composition: 119 mm nacl, 4.7 mm kcl, 1.0
mm nah2po4, 0.9 mm mgcl2, 2.5 mm cacl2, 25 mm
nahco2, and 11 mm glucose. physiological salt solutions
used throughout the experiments were aerated with a mixture
of oxygen (95%) and carbon dioxide (5%). proximal trachea
(pt) segments consisting of three to four cartilage rings were
removed from trachea adjacent to the larynx. distal trachea
(dt) segments consisting of three to four rings were removed
either from an area adjacent to the pt of the same trachea
or from an area approximately 1 cm distant from the end of
the pt. cartilage rings were suspended in water-jacketed
(37-38 °c) 10 ml tissue baths containing the physiological
salt solution. mechanical responses were recorded on a grass
polygraph (model 70, grass instruments, quincy, ma) via
force-displacement transducers (ft-03). the resting tension
was adjusted to 5g and maintained at the same level during
equilibration and drug incubation periods. rings were
allowed to equilibrate prior to any drug addition, during
which time the solutions in the baths were replaced with
fresh solution about every 10 min.
pt and dt segments from two guinea pigs were used
simultaneously in four tissue baths in each of the experiments. following equilibration of all of the segments
connected to the polygraph, the maximum contraction of the
tissues was obtained by addition of carbachol to a final
concentration of 0.1-1 µm. final maximum responses for

[125i]ias photolabeling of the beta2-adrenergic receptor
all drugs were taken to be the effects occurring when
additional increases in drug concentration failed to elicit a
further response. the time required to obtain complete doseresponse effects varied with the drug and tissue segment that
were used. cumulative dose-response relaxing effects of
salmeterol (on the pt segments) and ias (on the dt
segments) were obtained by increasing concentrations of the
added drugs while the previous doses remained in contact
with the tissues. tracheal rings were assumed to be in a
maximally relaxed state when further drug addition did not
generate more relaxation and after treatment of the tissues
with 10 µm  xxxd2842xxx .
in a second series of experiments, dose-response experiments were repeated with a slight modification of the
procedure described above. tissues from these experiments
were subsequently used for salmeterol and ias washout
studies following equilibration at their respective maximally
relaxed state. starting at time zero and at 5 min intervals
until 30 min, while the tissues were still connected to the
polygraph, the 10 ml physiological salt solutions contained
in each of the tissue baths were replaced with 10 ml of fresh
solution containing 1 µm carbachol. differential contractions
were measured at the end of each 5 min interval, and the
results were calculated as the percentage change relative to
the steady state.
photoaffinity labeling of human  xxxg92xxx  in hek 293 cell
membranes. photolabeling of the human  xxxg92xxx  in membranes
from stably transfected hek 293 cells was performed by
incubating membranes at 30 °c for 30 min in the dark with
radioligand in the presence or absence of 10 µm (-) xxxd123xxx  protector. the membranes were at a protein
concentration of approximately 3 mg/ml and were suspended
in 100 µl of buffer containing 20 mm hepes and 1 mm
edta. [125i]ias was added to a final concentration which
was between 0.7 and 1.0 nm. following incubation, membranes were diluted in 5 ml of ice-cold degassed buffer [10
mm tris, 100 mm nacl, and 2 mm edta (ph 7.4)].
immediately following dilution, the membranes were photolyzed at 4 °c through a 2 mm thick pyrex tube for 5 s at
a distance of 10 cm from a 1 kw mercury lamp. the
membranes were then pelleted by ultracentrifugation at
100000g in a beckman type 70.1 ti rotor. the membranes
were solubilized in a buffer containing 10 mm tris (ph 6.8),
2%  xxxd3215xxx , 10% glycerol, 5% 2- xxxd26xxx , and 0.05% bromphenol blue dye and subjected to
sds-page on a 12.5% gel. results were usually obtained
with a 48 h autoradiogram using a quanta iii intensifier
screen. the molecular mass of the receptor was estimated
using the following molecular mass standards: bovine
erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase (29 kda), egg albumin (45
kda), bovine plasma albumin (66 kda), rabbit muscle
phosphorylase b (97 kda), escherichia coli beta-galactosidase
(116 kda), and rabbit muscle myosin (205 kda).
purification and proteolysis of [125i]ias-labeled human
 xxxg92xxx . following photolysis, the membranes were completely
extracted with 400 µl of solubilization buffer [1% dodecyl
beta-d-maltoside, 500 mm nacl, 20 mm tris (ph 8.0), 6 m
urea, and 5 mm imidazole]. the extract was loaded onto a
column of 0.5 ml of nickel affinity resin. the resin was
then washed with 10 ml of buffer containing 0.1% dodecyl

stimulation of adenylyl cyclase in hek 293 membrane preparations. the dose-response experiment of adenylyl cyclase stimulation for

homogenized, after which membranes were isolated on sucrose step gradients. adenylyl cyclase assays were performed with various
concentrations of epinephrine as indicated. the ec50s for epinephrine activation were 7.1, 48, and 44 nm for control, salmeterol-pretreated,
and ias-pretreated conditions, respectively. assays were performed in triplicate, and the given values are the means from one experiment.

and by this measure to have equivalent exosite binding properties.

adenylate cyclase assays, whereas the the radioiodinated
compound was used for photolabeling. the synthetic protocol
for ams (compound 5) was similar to that for salmeterol
described previously (10), except for preparation of nitro
compound 2 (11). treatment of compound 1 proceeded
smoothly with nitronium tetrafluoroborate to give p-nitro
compound 2 and the o-nitro isomer. para product 2 was
separated from its o-nitro isomer by silica gel column
chromatography.
the iodination of ams 5 proved to be complicated. from
the structure of compound 5, illustrated in figure 1, there
are two phenyl rings which are both activated by either
hydroxyl groups or an amino group and can be accessed by
iodine. three iodinated products were isolated and identified
as the two monoiodinated compounds 7 and 8 and the
diiodinated product 9 from their spectral properties. we
found that the isotopomer distribution was directly controlled
by the reaction buffer ph (table 1). the difficulty in
generating the desired compound 7 in which the iodine is
located on the aminophenyl ring as a major product is the

fact that the saliginin ring is much more reactive to iodination
than the aminophenyl ring. as shown in table 1, a range of
ph values from 8.6 to 2.1 were tested, and an acidic condition
was found which slightly favors formation of 7. the
radioiodinated amine 7 was isolated and purified by tlc.
the purified compound 7 was shown to comigrate on tlc
with the identical nonradioactive compound. conversion of
the aminobenzyl group in the salmeterol derivatives to the
corresponding azide compound 10 ([125i]ias) proceeded
readily via the diazonium salt intermediate prepared in 3 n
acetic acid. carrier-free [125i]ias was stable in methanol at
-20 °c for at least 3 weeks.
cell-free activation of adenylyl cyclase in hek 293 cell
membranes by salmeterol, ias, and related derivatives. the
characteristics of salmeterol activation of adenylyl cyclase
have previously been reported (3, 4). ias was tested to
determine whether it would exhibit the same activation
properties as the parent drug, salmeterol. figure 2a shows
that the dose-response curves for  xxxg92xxx -mediated cyclase
activation by salmeterol and ias were similar, displaying

analogues (compounds 5, 6, 8, and 10 shown in figure 1). adenylyl
cyclase assays were performed as described in materials and
methods. assays were performed in triplicate, and the values that
are shown are the mean ( the range of two separate assays. all of
the compounds were assayed at a concentration of 10 nm.

ec50s of 2 and 5 nm, respectively. figure 3 demonstrates
that, in addition to ias, salmeterol-like agonist activity could
also be demonstrated with ams (compound 5) and azs
(compound 6). in the experiment whose results are depicted
in figure 3, all agonists were at a concentration of 10 nm
and no additional activation was observed with 100 nm drug.
the iodinated isomer ais 8 which contained the iodine on
the saligenin ring had approximately 50% of the activity of
salmeterol. the reduced activity of the iodinated saligenin
derivative 8 (ais) is not surprising since the bulky iodine
atom is likely to interfere with interaction of the saligenin
head with the  xxxg92xxx  catechol binding site.
comparison of the effect of pretreatment of hek 293
cells with salmeterol or ias on the subsequent activation
of adenylyl cyclase with the full agonist epinephrine. in
an assay in which the effect of agonist pretreatment on the
subsequent ability of epinephrine to stimulate the  xxxg92xxx  was
being measured, both salmeterol and ias behaved essentially
the same (figure 2b). the activity with no added epinephrine
represents the amount of drug carried over from the pretreatment which is not readily removed by the washes and
membrane purification procedure, and was identical for both
salmeterol and ias. the increased ec50 and decreased vmax
for epinephrine stimulation are caused by a combination of
drug-induced desensitization from the pretreatment and
competition of salmeterol or ias for the active site due to
residual drug from exosite binding and/or partitioning into
the lipid. the properties of both salmeterol and ias in this
assay are the same as those previously reported for salmeterol
(4).
guinea pig trachea relaxation dose-response and
washout assay. tissue segments from adult guinea pig
tracheas were used to compare dose responses when the
guinea pigs were treated with various concentrations of
salmeterol and ias (figure 2c). tissues were also used to
compare washout experiments when salmeterol and ias were
used. pooled data showed no significant differences in the
resistance to washout of these two compounds (figure 2d),
indicating that salmeterol and ias have equivalent exosite
binding properties.

show both agonist and antagonist photoaffinity labeling of the  xxxg92xxx  (the broad band around 70-80 kda).

[125i]ias (1 nm) was incubated in the presence (a and c) or
absence (b and d) of (-)- xxxd123xxx  (10-5 m). the incubation time
with [125i]ias was 30 min. the addition of gtpgammas (10-4 m) (c
and d) resulted in significant reduction of the extent of specific
labeling.

photoaffinity labeling experiments using partially purified
hek 293 cell membranes (figure 4),  xxxd123xxx -protectable
photolabeling of the  xxxg92xxx  could readily be demonstrated
(broad glycosylated band seen at approximately 70-80 kda;
see lanes a and b of figure 4). to further confirm that the
broad band at 70-80 kda was indeed the  xxxg92xxx , photolabeling of a separate aliquot of the same membranes was
also performed using the high-affinity beta2 antagonist photolabel, [125i]iabp (12) (see lanes c and d of figure 4). the
extent of labeling of the  xxxg92xxx  with [125i]ias is greatly
reduced by the presence of gtpgammas (see figure 5; compare
lanes c and d relative to control lanes a and b). the
reduction of the extent of [125i]ias photolabeling by addition
of gtpgammas suggests a decrease in agonist affinity caused by

dissociation of the g-protein-receptor complex. this corresponded with previous results which showed that salmeterol
displays a gtp shift, consistent with it being a very weak
partial agonist. these data indicate that ias interacts with
the receptor as an agonist and that exosite photolabeling in
the receptor binding site occurred primarily as the ternary
ias-receptor-g-protein complex.
purification and proteolysis of the  xxxg92xxx . ias-labeled  xxxg92xxx  from hek 293 membranes was purified by nickel
affinity chromatography as described in materials and
methods. the  xxxg92xxx  was specifically photolabeled in an
 xxxd123xxx -protectable manner by both [125i]iabp (figure 6,
lanes a and b) and [125i]ias (figure 6, lanes c and d). in
the large intracellular loop iii of human  xxxg92xxx , the amino
acid sequence segr is cleaved by  xxxg741xxx  protease (13).
a proteolytic cleavage at this site in the  xxxg92xxx  generates two
fragments; one fragment includes the glycosylated nterminus and first five tm segments, and the other fragment
(approximately 21 kda) contains tm segments 6 and 7 and
the c-terminus (figure 6).  xxxg741xxx  digestion of the control
[125i]iabp-labeled receptor generated two radiolabeled peptides: a highly glycosylated peptide containing helices 1-5
(broad, glycosylated band around 50-60 kda; figure 6, lanes
e and f) and a smaller peptide containing tms 6 and 7 (sharp
band around 21 kda; figure 6, lanes e and f) consistent
with previous results (1, 14). in contrast, however, factor
xa cleavage of the [125i]ias-derivatized receptor revealed
essentially all of the label only on the smaller c-terminal
peptide containing tms 6 and 7 (figure 6, lanes g and h).
this was further confirmed by showing that this small
c-terminal  xxxd2282xxx -tagged peptide bound to a nickel
affinity column following proteolysis and could be eluted
with 300 mm imidazole (figure 6, lanes i-n). considering
that the photoactive azide moiety is positioned on the ring
at the end of the long hydrophobic portion of salmeterol
which confers long functional activity, and which is hypothesized to be involved in exosite binding, we conclude that
if there is a high-affinity exosite on the receptor, and at least
a portion of this may be contributed by the fragment which
contains tm segments 6 and 7.
discussion
salmeterol and certain other long-chain antagonists and
agonists of the  xxxg92xxx  have unusual properties. these properties involve a prolonged agonist action on the receptor even
after removal of excess salmeterol, which can be inhibited
by antagonists but recovers its agonist properties following
removal of antagonist (2, 15, 16). salmeterol possesses a
very high coefficient for partitioning between the hydrophobic and aqueous environments which has led to the hypothesis that the long-acting properties of salmeterol are due to
access to the  xxxg92xxx  binding site from within the bilayer (6,
7), and recent kinetic studies may support this proposal (9).
however, support for the presence of a specific exosite found
on the  xxxg92xxx  is suggested by two lines of evidence. first,
salmeterol exosite binding is specific to the  xxxg92xxx . when
recombinant human  xxxg836xxx , beta2, and  xxxg838xxx  receptors were transfected
into cho cells, the only receptor which demonstrated
persistent, exosite binding salmeterol kinetics was the  xxxg92xxx  (16). second, exosite binding cannot be entirely a
function of the lipophilic character of salmeterol. a series
of salmeterol-like molecules were synthesized in which the

293 cell membranes was photolabeled with [125i]iabp and [125i]ias and purified using nickel affinity resin (lanes a-d). the
labeled  xxxg92xxx  was then treated with  xxxg741xxx  protease. lanes e
and f contained the two radioactive peptides from [125i]iabplabeled  xxxg92xxx . in lanes g and h, only the smaller c-terminal peptide
was labeled by [125i]ias. (ii) the c-terminal, ias-photolabeled
peptide can bind to and be eluted from a nickel column. shown is

these were loaded onto nickel resin and washed with 20 column
volumnes of low-imidazole buffer. no labeled peptide eluted in
the washes (lanes k and l). the columns were then eluted with
300 mm imidazole (lanes m and n), and the  xxxd123xxx  protectably
labeled peptide was recovered. (iii) diagram of the  xxxg92xxx  showing

position of the ether oxygen was moved along the long-chain
saturated hydrocarbon tail. within the saturated hydrocarbon

[125i]ias photolabeling of the beta2-adrenergic receptor
tail, salmeterol has six methylene groups on one side of the
ether oxygen and four methylenes on the other (“6 and 4”).
the salmeterol-like molecules had the same number of
methylenes, but the position of the ether oxygen was different
(“4 and 6”, “5 and 5”, “2 and 8”, “8 and 2”, or “9 and 1”).
all of these molecules had the very same partition coefficient,
but their reported duration of action varied widely. salmeterol
(“6 and 4”) had the longest duration of action (>720 min),
while the shortest acting molecule was the “2 and 8”
compound (2.7 min) (2). specificity in both the receptor and
the position of the ether oxygen suggests distinct exosite
binding determinants, i.e., an exosite which is contained at
least in part within the specific sequences of the  xxxg92xxx .
on the basis of the initial observation that, unlike the  xxxg92xxx , the  xxxg91xxx  does not exhibit salmeterol exosite binding
behavior, green et al. (5) addressed the question of the
molecular basis of the salmeterol exosite by substituting
portions of the  xxxg836xxx  receptor into the beta2 receptor and testing
for exosite binding activity in drug washout experiments.
they identified a sequence of amino acids in tm 4 that had
some effect on exosite binding. when the  xxxg836xxx  sequence was
placed into the beta2 receptor, the extent of exosite binding was
diminished by approximately two-thirds. in the reverse
chimera, when the beta2 sequence was placed into the  xxxg836xxx 
receptor, a degree of exosite binding activity was recovered.
while those authors did not specifically suggest that any
other particular sites on the  xxxg92xxx  contribute to exosite
binding, they recognized the fact that there may be other
sites on the receptor which contribute to exosite interactions.
we chose to take a biochemical approach to locating the
salmeterol binding site. since the exosite binding behavior
of salmeterol is attributed to the long n-aryloxyalkyl side
chain, it was logical to identify the position of the phenyl
ring at the end of this long chain by placing a photomoiety
at this location in the molecule. a novel salmeterol-based
photolabel ([125i]ias) with the photoactivatable azide group
positioned on the exosite binding portion of the molecule
was synthesized and used to label the  xxxg92xxx , and the labeled
receptor was cleaved at a unique known site into a large
n-terminal and a small c-terminal peptide. all of the ias
label was only on the portion of the  xxxg92xxx  which contains
tms 6 and 7, and not on the larger fragment, which includes
tm 4. as in the case of the sequence identified by green et
al. in the cytoplasmic half of tm 4, there are also a number
of amino acid differences between the  xxxg91xxx  and the  xxxg92xxx 
in the extracellular halves of tm 6 and tm 7, and these
may also contribute to the differences in the exosite binding
activity between these two receptors. recently, it has been
demonstrated by construction of chimeric receptors and sitedirected mutagenesis that residues in tm 7 do in fact
contribute to salmeterol high-affinity binding. kurose et al.
(17) took advantage of the great difference in salmeterol
binding affinities between the  xxxg836xxx -adrenergic receptor (2200
nm) and the beta2-adrenergic receptor (1.5 nm) by constructing
chimeric receptors and testing salmeterol binding affinity to
determine which portions of the receptor were responsible
for the difference in binding affinity. after tm 7 of the beta2adrenergic receptor was replaced with the corresponding
segment from the  xxxg836xxx -adrenergic receptor, the affinity for
salmeterol changed completely from being beta2-like (highaffinity) to being  xxxg836xxx -like (low-affinity). when the reverse
chimera was constructed (tm 7 of the beta2-adrenergic receptor

figure 7: speculative model of the binding of ias to the  xxxg92xxx .
the  xxxg92xxx  tm helices are from the model of donnelly et al. (18)
obtained from the embl g-protein-coupled receptor database (19).
elements incorporated in this model include the catechol hydroxyls
within hydrogen bonding distance of serines 205 and 207 in tm
5, the amine interaction with  xxxd233xxx  113 in tm 3, and the
photoaffinity labeling data from this paper, which demonstrate that
the iodoazidophenyl ring of ias is near tm 6 or tm 7.

placed into a  xxxg836xxx -adrenergic receptor background), a large
measure of the high-affinity binding was regained. this
molecular biological evidence for important salmeterol
binding determinants existing in tm 7 is consistent with the
biochemical data for iodoazidosalmeterol photolabeling
presented in this report. kurose et al. further introduced
mutations of 10 amino acids in tm 7 that were different
between these two adrenergic receptor subtypes, and found
that mutation of the single amino acid tyrosine 308 (in the
beta2-adrenergic receptor) to alanine led to an approximate 100fold decrease in salmeterol affinity, but not the entire 1500fold change seen in the chimera when the entire transmembrane segment was replaced. this suggests that multiple
residues in tm 7 contribute to salmeterol binding affinity
and is consistent with the ias photoaffinity labeling results.
the possibility exists that multiple regions of the receptor
and also some component of lipid bilayer interaction may
contribute to exosite binding interactions with salmeterol and,
more specifically, that the interaction of the salmeterol
hydrophobic tail with tm 6 and/or tm 7 may contribute
incrementally to the binding affinity, and hence serve
minimally as an exosite. with the ias photolabel as a tool,
we are now in a position to assess directly whether ias
remains “tethered” at the  xxxg92xxx  in the presence of a functionblocking concentration of antagonist, and these experiments
are now underway.
it is widely accepted that serines 204 and 207 in tm 5
and  xxxd233xxx  113 in tm 3 interact with the hydroxyl
groups and the amine, respectively, of  xxxg92xxx  ligands,
including salmeterol. recently, it has been proposed that the
ether oxygen of the n-aryloxyalkyl side chain of salmeterol

11286 biochemistry, vol. 38, no. 35, 1999
may interact with tyrosine 316 in tm 7 (17). the photoaffinity labeling data presented in this paper demonstrate that
the iodoazidophenyl ring of ias photoincorporates into either
tm 6, tm 7, or both. when this information is taken
together, a model of the manner in which salmeterol may
bind to the  xxxg92xxx  can be hypothesized (figure 7). the
donnelly model for the human  xxxg92xxx  tm segments (18) was
obtained from the embl g-protein-coupled receptor database (19). modeling was carried out on a silicon graphics
o2 computer using the program sybyl (tripos, st. louis,
mo). we have modeled the iodoazidophenyl ring of ias as
interacting with trp 313, which was found to be the
photoincorporation site for the antagonist photoaffinity label,
iabp, in the turkey erythrocyte beta receptor (14). if ias does
interact at the same site on tm 7 as the shorter photolabel
iabp, it would suggest a partially folded conformation for
salmeterol, which does not seem unreasonable to us;
however, this is speculation. an equally reasonable hypothesis may be that salmeterol interaction occurs on the opposite
face of tm 7 with tyr 308. support for this alternative
hypothesis comes from the fact that when mutated to ala,
tyr 308 was found to be responsible for approximantely 10%
of the difference in binding affinity between the  xxxg92xxx  (high
affinity) and the  xxxg91xxx  (low affinity) (17). modeling is limited
because there is no high-resolution structure of the receptor
available and because the precise amino acid where ias
reacts has not yet been determined. however, at present we
hypothesize that photolabeling occurs in the extracellular half
of tm 6 or 7, rather than in the intracellular half. one reason
for this prediction is that the  xxxg91xxx , which does not exhibit
long-acting salmeterol exosite binding behavior, differs
significantly from the  xxxg92xxx  in the extracellular halves of
both tm 6 and tm 7, but less so in the intracellular halves
of these tm segments, possibly suggesting that unique
salmeterol binding determinants are in the extracellular half
of tm 6 and/or tm 7.
ias was thoroughly compared to salmeterol in both a cellfree adenylyl cyclase assay and a tissue-based assay. ias
exhibited properties nearly identical to those of salmeterol
for activation of adenylyl cyclase (2-3-fold increased ec50)
in a cell-free assay, and exhibited similar effects of pretreatment on subsequent assays of epinephrine stimulation. ias
also exhibited the same dose-response curve and drug
washout kinetics as salmeterol in perfused guinea pig trachea
assays.
the salmeterol derivatives that are reported in this paper
(figure 1) represent a unique approach to the synthesis of
this compound and its analogues. this approach was based
on a synthesis of salmeterol which we have recently
described (10). the primary feature of the synthetic scheme
is the relative simplicity of the approach, which has allowed
us to prepare multiple derivatives of salmeterol, namely,
amino substituted, azido substituted, and iodoazido substituted in a relatively straightforward fashion.

rong et al.
in summary, we have developed a novel photoaffinity
probe [125i]ias, in which the photoactivatable azide is at the
extreme end of the salmeterol n-aryloxyalkyl chain which
confers the very long-acting properties to this compound. a
specific region of the  xxxg92xxx  containing tm 6 and 7 is labeled
by this compound in an  xxxd123xxx -protectable manner. these
results expand the current view of the salmeterol binding
site and suggest a method for the future work of directly
testing the exosite hypothesis using this novel photolabel.
these results may provide useful information concerning the
manner in which other g-protein-coupled receptor ligands
could be rendered long-acting agonists or antagonists.
