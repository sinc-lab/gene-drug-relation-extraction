 xxxg1664xxx  is a vertebrate ortholog of the invertebrate
 xxxg1664xxx  gap junction proteins (1), but it does not appear to form
functional gap junctions in vivo. instead  xxxg1664xxx  acts as a
membrane channel that carries ions and signaling molecules
between the cytoplasm and the extracellular space (2, 3). as
such, it is a candidate atp release channel in various cell types,
including erythrocytes, astrocytes, bronchial epithelial cells,
and taste cells. various functional roles have been ascribed to
 xxxg1664xxx  including local vascular perfusion control and

propagation of intercellular calcium waves (4 – 6). recently
 xxxg1664xxx  was also shown to form the large pore of the p2x7
purinergic receptor (7, 8). p2x7 plays a major role in inflammation, and its activation by extracellular atp results in release of
interleukin (il)2-1␤ from macrophages, probably involving
 xxxg1664xxx  as a signaling molecule (7).
il-1␤ production and maturation are tightly regulated by
 xxxg340xxx  incorporated into large protein complexes termed
inflammasomes (9 –11). the molecular composition of the
inflammasome depends on the identity of the nod-like receptor (nlr) family member serving as a scaffold protein in the
complex (12). the members of the cytosolic nlr family appear
to recognize conserved microbial and viral components termed
pathogen-associated molecular patterns in intracellular compartments (13). the bipartite adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a card (asc) bridges the
interaction between nlr proteins and inflammatory caspases
and plays a central role in the assembly of inflammasomes
and the activation of  xxxg340xxx  in response to a broad range
of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and intracellular
pathogens (14). in addition, the inflammasome can be activated by danger-associated molecular patterns, molecules
endogenous to the organism that signal stress or injury,
including extracellular atp acting at ionotropic p2x7
receptors, fibronectin, or monosodium urate crystals (15,
16). moreover it has been suggested that a rapid k⫹ efflux
through atp-activated p2x7 receptors induces inflammasome assembly (17–20).
despite the recent advances in the understanding of accessory proteins required for full activation of  xxxg340xxx , little is
known about the signaling pathways that trigger inflammasome activation, particularly in the central nervous system
(cns). recently we reported that spinal cord neurons contain
the nlrp1/nalp1 inflammasome consisting of nlrp1, asc,
 xxxg340xxx , caspase-11, and the  xxxg2432xxx 
protein ( xxxg2432xxx ) and that spinal cord injury induces rapid activation of the inflammasome, causing processing and secretion
of il-1␤ and il-18. moreover antibody neutralization of asc
reduces  xxxg340xxx  activation and il-1 cytokine processing,
leading to significant tissue sparing and functional improvement (21). in this study, we focused on signaling events cou2

the inflammasome is a multiprotein complex involved in
innate immunity. activation of the inflammasome causes the
processing and release of the cytokines interleukins 1␤ and 18.
in primary macrophages, potassium ion flux and the membrane
channel  xxxg1664xxx  have been suggested to play roles in inflammasome activation. however, the molecular mechanism(s) governing inflammasome signaling remains poorly defined, and it is
undetermined whether these mechanisms apply to the central
nervous system. here we show that high extracellular potassium
opens pannexin channels leading to  xxxg340xxx  activation in primary neurons and astrocytes. the effect of kⴙ on  xxxg1664xxx 
channels was independent of membrane potential, suggesting
that stimulation of inflammasome signaling was mediated by
an allosteric effect. the activation of the inflammasome by kⴙ
was inhibited by the  xxxg1664xxx  channel blocker probenecid,
supporting a role of  xxxg1664xxx  in inflammasome activation.
co-immunoprecipitation of neuronal lysates indicates that
 xxxg1664xxx  associates with components of the multiprotein
inflammasome complex, including the p2x7 receptor and
 xxxg340xxx . moreover antibody neutralization of the adaptor
protein asc (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a card) blocked atp-induced cell death in oocytes coexpressing p2x7 receptor and  xxxg1664xxx . thus, in contrast to
macrophages and monocytes in which low intracellular kⴙ has
been suggested to trigger inflammasome activation, in neural
cells, high extracellular kⴙ activates  xxxg340xxx  probably
through  xxxg1664xxx .

 xxxg1664xxx  activates the inflammasome
pling  xxxg1664xxx  and p2x7 receptors to rapid  xxxg340xxx  activation in primary neurons and astrocytes. we provide compelling
evidence that high extracellular k⫹ opens the  xxxg1664xxx  channel and activates inflammasomes in neurons and astrocytes, but
not thp-1 cells, thus leading to  xxxg340xxx  activation. this signaling pathway in neurons is mediated through protein interactions between  xxxg1664xxx  and inflammasome proteins. we
also provide evidence that atp acting on p2x7 induces rapid
cell death and that antibody neutralization of asc blocks atpinduced cell death. thus, contrary to the widely accepted view
in macrophages and monocytes that low intracellular k⫹ triggers inflammasome activation, high extracellular k⫹ surrounding cells such as neurons and astrocytes opens  xxxg1664xxx  channels and induces processing of  xxxg340xxx .

experimental procedures
antibodies—rabbit anti-rattus norvegicus asc and nlrp1
antisera were prepared by bethyl laboratories as described previously (21). chicken anti- xxxg1664xxx  (4515) has been characterized (4), and antibody affinity-purified on a matrix with the
cognate peptide (prepared by aves labs inc.) was used. other
antibodies were purchased from commercial sources and
included anti-nlrp1 (abcam), anti-il-1␤ (cell signaling
technology inc.), anti- xxxg340xxx  (upstate); anti- xxxg340xxx 
(santa cruz biotechnology, inc.), anti-caspase-11 (alexis biochemicals), anti-caspase-11 (santa cruz biotechnology, inc.),
anti- xxxg2432xxx  (bd transduction laboratories), anti-caspase-3
(santa cruz biotechnology, inc.), and anti-p2x7 receptor
(calbiochem).
cell culture and treatment—neuronal cultures were prepared from embryonic day 16 –17 rat cortices as described previously (22, 23). cortical tissue was disrupted into a cell suspension by gentle trituration and seeded in 60-mm dishes at a
density of 2 ⫻ 106 cells/dish. neurons were grown on poly-llysine-coated tissue culture dishes in n5 medium that contained 5% serum fraction (24). neurons were maintained for 12
days, and the neuronal nature of the majority of cells (95%) was
confirmed electrophysiologically and immunohistochemically
(22). primary astrocytes were obtained from neonatal rat cerebral cortices as described previously (22). the cells were maintained for 3 weeks in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% horse serum. at least 99% of the cell
populations were astrocytes as determined by staining with
cell-specific markers (22). the human monocytic cell line
thp-1 (american type culture collection) was maintained in
rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 0.05 mm 2-mecaptoethanol and 10% fetal bovine serum. cells were pretreated with
1 mm probenecid (alfa aesar) for 10 min. the medium was
removed and replaced with medium containing probenecid
and 130 mm kcl for 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h, whereas controls
received probenecid alone. cells were washed once in ice-cold
pbs and lysed as described previously (25) and prepared for
immunoblot analysis.
 xxxg1664xxx  knockdown— xxxg1664xxx  was knocked down
using short hairpin (sh)rna inserted into a retroviral silencing
plasmid (prs) purchased from origene. one microgram of
 xxxg1664xxx  shrna expression plasmids containing  xxxd3041xxx 
resistance was transfected into the human 1321n1 astrocytoma

cells plated in 35-mm dishes using lipofectamine 2000 reagent.
after overnight incubation, transfection reagents were removed, and cells were transferred to 100-mm dishes containing
selection medium (dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 ␮g/ml  xxxd3041xxx ). after 2–3 weeks in selection medium, clones were tested
for appropriate  xxxg1664xxx  knockdown (18) using western blot
analysis. the selected  xxxg1664xxx -kd 1321n1 cells were maintained
in selection medium in a humidified chamber (100% humidity,
95% air, 5% co2, 37 °c).
immunoblotting—primary cell cultures were lysed in lysis
buffer (20 mm tris, ph 7.5, 150 mm nacl, 1 mm edta, 1 mm
egta, 1% triton x-100, 2.5 mm pyrophosphate, 1 mm ␤-glycerophosphate) with protease inhibitor mixture (sigma-aldrich). for immunoblot analysis of oocytes, each lane contained
extracts of three oocytes that were pooled and lysed in 50 ␮l of
oocyte ringer’s solution (or2) by repeated passage through the
end of a 1-ml disposable pipette tip. cells were spun at 12,000 ⫻
g for 3 min, and samples were taken from the supernatant,
avoiding both the pellet and the lipids on the surface. laemmli
sample buffer was added, and proteins were resolved on
10 –20% tris-hcl criterion precast gels (bio-rad), transferred
to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (millipore), placed in
blocking buffer (pbs, 0.1% tween 20, 0.4% i-block (applied
biosystems)), and then incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies followed by appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase
(hrp)-linked antibodies (cell signaling technology inc.).
visualization of signal was enhanced by chemiluminescence
using a phototope-hrp detection kit (cell signaling technology inc.). to control for protein loading, immunoblots were
stripped with restore western blot stripping buffer (26) and
blotted for ␤-tubulin using monoclonal anti-␤-tubulin antibody (1:5000, bd biosciences pharmingen). quantification of
band density was performed using un-scan-it geltm digitizing software (silk scientific, inc.), and data were normalized to
␤-tubulin.
co-immunoprecipitation—to assess the protein composition and association of proteins in the inflammasome, primary
neuronal cultures (2 ⫻ 106 cells) were lysed in 200 ␮l of lysis
buffer (20 mm tris, ph 7.5, 150 mm nacl, 1 mm edta, 1 mm
egta, 1% triton x-100, 2.5 mm pyrophosphate, 1 mm ␤-glycerophosphate) with protease inhibitor mixture (sigma-aldrich). approximately 200 ␮g of neuronal lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-asc or anti- xxxg1664xxx  antibodies
using trueblottm anti-rabbit ig or preciphen (aves labs inc.)
immunoprecipitation beads. neuronal lysates were precleared
by adding 50 ␮l of anti-rabbit trueblot beads to 200 ␮g of lysate
in a microcentrifuge tube. the mixture was incubated for 1 h at
4 °c, and beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 ⫻ g for
30 s. the supernatant was recovered and immunoprecipitated
with 5 ␮g of anti-asc or anti- xxxg1664xxx  and incubated at 4 °c
overnight. fifty microliters of anti-rabbit trueblot beads or
anti-chicken preciphen beads were added to the mixture, incubated for 2 h, and then centrifuged at 12,000 ⫻ g for 30 s. the
pelleted beads were washed five times in lysis buffer, resuspended in loading buffer, and heated at 95 °c for 3 min before
analysis by immunoblotting using antibodies against asc,

 xxxg1664xxx  activates the inflammasome

results
high extracellular k⫹ activates  xxxg1664xxx — xxxg1664xxx  is a
channel that releases atp and other ions from the cell. accordingly an increase of extracellular k⫹ concentration causes atp
release from xenopus oocytes expressing  xxxg1664xxx  (2, 28, 29).
however, electrophysiological data suggest that  xxxg1664xxx 
opens only when depolarized to positive membrane potentials.

to investigate this apparent discrepancy, we applied 130 mm
k⫹ to  xxxg1664xxx  channels in voltage-clamped oocytes held at
potentials at which the channel is normally closed. when high
extracellular k⫹ was applied, currents in response to a 10-mv
test pulse from a holding potential of ⫺50 mv increased in a
reproducible and reversible fashion (fig. 1a and supplemental
fig. 1a). the k⫹-induced current was attenuated by  xxxd433xxx  (fig. 1a) and by probenecid (supplemental fig. 2). in contrast, application of extracellular k⫹ to noninjected oocytes
increased conductance only moderately (fig. 1b). to quantify
this increase, we measured the conductance of oocytes to this
test pulse and found that 130 mm k⫹ increased conductance
substantially in  xxxg1664xxx -expressing oocytes (fig. 1c). application of 130 mm k⫹ also increased the holding current needed
to maintain cells at ⫺50 mv compared with noninjected
oocytes (fig. 1d). the effect of k⫹ was dose-dependent. the
lowest potassium concentration required for detectable activation of  xxxg1664xxx  currents was 20 mm (supplemental fig. 1b).
replacement of na⫹ with choline⫹ did not activate pannexin
(not shown), indicating that the observed effects are due to k⫹
and not the removal of na⫹.  xxxd2988xxx  was as effective
as potassium gluconate to activate  xxxg1664xxx  channels (not
shown).
the activation of  xxxg1664xxx  currents by high extracellular
k⫹ was observed over a wide range of voltages (fig. 2) with
depolarization facilitating the process. only at high positive
potentials was the effect of high k⫹ minimal, probably because
of exhaustion of recruitable channels. taken together, these
data support the hypothesis that high extracellular k⫹ opens
 xxxg1664xxx  channels at resting potentials at which the channel
is normally closed. to test whether k⫹ also stimulates
 xxxg1664xxx -mediated dye uptake, we used the astrocytoma cell
line 1321n1. thirty-minute exposure of 1321n1 cells to a
depolarizing solution (50 mm k⫹) caused a significant influx of
yopro1 into cells compared with those bathed in normal (5 mm
k⫹) solution (control, 0.99 ⫾ 0.012-fold; high k⫹, 1.24 ⫾ 0.031fold; n ⫽ 6 fields from three experiments) (fig. 3). high k⫹-induced dye uptake was significantly attenuated (0.99 ⫾ 0.017fold, n ⫽ 6 fields from three experiments) when  xxxg1664xxx  was
knocked down with  xxxg1664xxx  shrna (fig. 3).
probenecid is a “specific” inhibitor of pannexin—distinguishing the functions of  xxxg1664xxx  channels from connexin
channels has been hampered by the lack of specific inhibitors
able to discriminate between them. despite the lack of any
sequence homology between pannexins and connexins, known
inhibitors of connexins also inhibit pannexin channels.  xxxd433xxx  demonstrates some specificity as its dose dependence
for inhibition of pannexin and connexins differs by a factor of
⬃3 (30). we have reported that a more specific inhibitor of
 xxxg1664xxx  is probenecid, a common drug used to treat gout
and gouty arthritis (29). application of probenecid rapidly
inhibited voltage-induced  xxxg1664xxx  currents in oocytes as did
 xxxd433xxx  (fig. 4). we also found that probenecid significantly reduced the currents in response to application of 130
mm extracellular k⫹ (supplemental fig. 2), providing additional
evidence that  xxxg1664xxx  is responsible for the currents in
response to the extracellular k⫹ application.

preparation of oocytes—oocytes were prepared as described
previously (27). xenopus laevis oocytes were isolated by incubating small pieces of ovary in 2 mg/ml collagenase type i
(worthington) in ca2⫹-free or2 (82.5 mm nacl, 2.5 mm kcl,
1.0 mm mgcl2, 1.0 mm cacl2, 1.0 mm na2hpo4, 5.0 mm hepes
(ph 7.5) with antibiotics (10,000 units/ml penicillin and 10
mg/ml streptomycin) and stirring at one turn/s for 3 h at room
temperature. after thorough washing with regular or2,
oocytes devoid of follicle cells and having a uniform pigmentation were selected and stored in or2 at 18 °c.
crna and electrophysiology—rna for mouse  xxxg1664xxx 
was prepared using the mmessage mmachine in vitro transcription kit (ambion). oocytes were injected with 20 – 40 nl of
crna (1 ␮g/␮l) and incubated for 18 – 48 h at 18 °c. rna for
human  xxxg1664xxx  and p2x7 was similarly prepared and
injected. oocytes were then incubated for 7– 8 days prior to
electrophysiological analysis at room temperature. oocytes
were tested using two-electrode voltage clamp (model
oc725c, warner instruments) under constant perfusion
according to the protocols described in the figures.
asc antibody neutralization—oocytes expressing both
human  xxxg1664xxx  and p2x7 receptor were tested 7– 8 days
after injection of rna. cells were clamped at ⫺40 mv, and 5-s
test pulses to ⫺35 mv were applied. after base-line readings
were taken in or2, cells were exposed to 500 ␮m atp for 4 min
and then returned to or2. after it was established that the atp
reliably resulted in cell death, remaining co-expressing cells
were then injected with 60 nl of anti-asc (diluted 1:10 in pbs)
or 60 nl of control igg (diluted 1:10 in pbs). after 1 h, the
reinjected cells were exposed to 500 ␮m atp and tested as
before.
dye uptake—parental and  xxxg1664xxx -kd 1321n1 human astrocytoma cells were exposed for 30 min to control solution (145
mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 1.4 mm cacl2, 1.0 mm mgcl2, 10 mm
hepes, ph 7.4) and to a depolarizing solution (60 mm nacl, 50
mm kcl, 1.4 mm cacl2, 1.0 mm mgcl2, 10 mm hepes, ph 7.4)
containing 10 ␮m yopro1. after treatment, cells were washed
with control solution and then fixed with p-formaldehyde, and
cover slips were mounted using vectashield mounting medium
containing 4⬘,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. yopro fluorescence
intensity was measured from the whole field of view of high k⫹
(50 mm)-treated cells and normalized to that obtained under
control (5 mm k⫹) conditions. images were acquired using
metafluor software (universal imaging corp.) and a digital
camera (photometrics hq2) attached to a nikon inverted
te-2000e microscope equipped with a 10⫻ objective and fluorescein isothiocyanate and 4⬘,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole filter sets.

k⫹ activation of inflammasomes is blocked by the  xxxg1664xxx 
inhibitor probenecid—neurons in culture express the nlrp1

protein lysates for  xxxg340xxx  activation. as shown in fig. 5, neurons and astrocytes exposed to high extracellular k⫹ showed an
increase in  xxxg340xxx  activation when compared with untreated
controls.
as shown by others (20), human thp-1 cells were refractory
to high extracellular k⫹ exposure and therefore served as control. pretreatment with the pannexin channel blocker probenecid (1 mm) prior to high k⫹ treatment suppressed  xxxg340xxx 
induction in neurons and astrocytes (fig. 5). thus, inflammasome activation and  xxxg340xxx  processing induced by high
extracellular k⫹ are inhibited by blocking the  xxxg1664xxx  channel, suggesting a role for  xxxg1664xxx  in the activation of the
inflammasome in neurons and astrocytes but not thp-1 cells.

 xxxd433xxx .

the supernatant contained more of the unprocessed than the
mature form of il-1␤. the rapid increase in  xxxg340xxx  expression after stimulation is in agreement with observations made
in cns injury models (21, 31, 32). a similar rapid increase of
 xxxg340xxx  is also observed in macrophages exposed to gramnegative bacteria or other agents like pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (9, 33).
for an alternate test for a role of  xxxg1664xxx  in the activation
of the inflammasome by k⫹ we used the 1321n1 cell line. the
parental cell line exhibited an activation pattern of  xxxg340xxx 
similar to that of primary astrocytes and neurons in response to
stimulation with high k⫹. in contrast,  xxxg340xxx  in the
 xxxg1664xxx  knockdown line was barely detectable and did not
show increased activation (fig. 6). the reduced expression of
 xxxg340xxx  could be due to either transcriptional/translational
effects or stability of the various components of the inflammasome multiprotein complex. it is conceivable that unassembled
 xxxg340xxx  is degraded faster than the complexed protein.

ture, co-immunoprecipitations of neuronal lysates exposed to
130 mm kcl for 1 h were performed using anti- xxxg1664xxx 
antibody (fig. 7, left). anti- xxxg1664xxx  immunoprecipitated
nlrp1, asc,  xxxg340xxx  and -11,  xxxg2432xxx ,  xxxg1664xxx , and the
p2x7 receptor.  xxxg340xxx  was processed into its fragments
(p26 and p13), and full-length  xxxg2432xxx  was cleaved into a 30-kda
fragment. thus, exposure to high extracellular k⫹ activates
inflammasomes. anti- xxxg1664xxx  did not immunoprecipitate
caspase-3, serving as a control. caspase-3, however, was
expressed in neurons as indicated by its presence in the lysate
(supplemental fig. 4). like  xxxg340xxx , caspase-3 levels increased
with exposure to extracellular k⫹. in reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments, anti-asc immunoprecipitated
nlrp1, asc and  xxxg340xxx  and -11 as well as  xxxg2432xxx ,  xxxg1664xxx ,
and the purinergic receptor p2x7 (fig. 7, right). these findings
demonstrate that the nlrp1 inflammasome in neurons associates with  xxxg1664xxx  and the p2x7 receptor.
the co-immunoprecipitation pattern was similar in
unstimulated and stimulated neurons, suggesting that the
inflammasome complex is preassembled. this observation is
consistent with findings that the nlrp1 inflammasome is preassembled in motor neurons of the spinal cord (21). thus, signaling within the chain of inflammasome components in neurons probably results from allosteric events rather than
assembly of the nlrp1 complex.
inhibition of the inflammasome prevents cell death in
 xxxg1664xxx  ⫹ p2x7-co-expressing cells—repetitive or sustained application of atp to cells co-expressing the p2x7 purinergic receptor and  xxxg1664xxx  causes cell death (supplemental
fig. 5) (8). oocytes expressing either  xxxg1664xxx  or the p2x7
receptor alone did not lose membrane integrity when subjected
to the same stimulus protocol (4, 8). atp-induced oocyte death
is characterized by an irreversible electrical breakdown of the
cell membrane even after atp has been removed (fig. 8). to

primary cortical neurons, astrocytes, and thp-1 cells were maintained in culture and treated for 30 min (30⬘), 1 h, and 2 h with 130 mm kcl. other cultures
(p) were pretreated with 1 mm probenecid for 10 min, and the medium was
removed and replaced with medium containing probenecid and 130 mm kcl for
30 min, whereas controls (cp) received probenecid alone. ␤-tubulin was used as
an internal standard and control for protein loading. c, media change only.

sary for this atp-induced cell death, we first tested oocytes for
the presence of the inflammasome protein asc. fig. 8d shows
that a protein of appropriate size (26 kda) is recognized by an
anti-asc antibody in an oocyte lysate. for functional testing,
we injected 60 nl of anti-asc antibody (diluted 1:10 in pbs)
into oocytes 1 h before electrophysiological analysis. as shown
previously (8), cells expressing human  xxxg1664xxx  and p2x7
exposed to 500 ␮m atp for 4 min subsequently underwent cell
death (fig. 8a). in contrast, all cells injected with anti-asc fully
recovered from prolonged atp exposure and also recovered
from a second 4-min atp exposure (fig. 8b). injection of a
nonspecific immunoglobulin (igg) did not protect cells (fig.
8c), demonstrating that anti-asc was responsible for cell survival and suggesting that asc is necessary for atp-induced cell
death.

discussion
the results of the present study show that  xxxg1664xxx  channels as well as the inflammasome can be activated by high extra-

18148 journal of biological chemistry

cellular k⫹. activation of  xxxg1664xxx  channels by extracellular
k⫹ is not due to the depolarization resulting from the elimination of the transmembrane k⫹ gradient because it occurred in
cells voltage-clamped to the resting membrane potential. consequently the ions must bind to an extracellular moiety that is
either part of the  xxxg1664xxx  sequence or of an auxiliary molecule. this activation mechanism by an extracellular ion as a
ligand is unusual as channel activation by ions is typically
observed intracellularly. only protons are also known to induce
activity of the sodium channel enac from the extracellular side
(34) apparently by relieving self-inhibition of the channel by
na⫹ (35). protons also activate acid-sensing ion channels (36).
whether k⫹ activation of  xxxg1664xxx  channels occurs in vivo
is unclear. the high concentrations of k⫹ ions required for
channel activation (⬎20 mm) might only come about in the
vicinity of dying cells releasing their cytoplasmic contents into a
confined space. alternatively efflux of k⫹ through  xxxg1664xxx 
channels could create a locally high k⫹ concentration sufficient
to activate the channel. this mechanism would represent an
additional positive feedback loop of  xxxg1664xxx  activation.
 xxxg1664xxx  channels are prime candidates to serve as atp
release channels. when co-expressed with p2y or with p2x7
receptors, extracellular application of atp results in pannexin
1-mediated membrane currents (8, 37). this type of positive
feedback is consistent with the observation of atp-induced
atp release (38). repetitive or sustained application of atp to
cells co-expressing p2x7 receptor with  xxxg1664xxx  results in cell
death (8). thus, there must be regulatory mechanisms that keep
this potentially deadly channel in check. indeed atp has recently
been identified as a  xxxg1664xxx  channel inhibitor and thus acts as a
permeant regulating its own permeation pore (39).

for this phenomenon.  xxxg1664xxx 
appears to be part of a large proteinsignaling cascade that links the
p2x7 receptor to the components of
the inflammasome resulting in
caspase activation and eventual
release of cytokines. thus, not only
did a neutralizing antibody to asc
inhibit atp-induced cell death in
oocytes co-expressing  xxxg1664xxx 
and p2x7 receptors, but probenecid

probenecid is known as an inhibitor
of organic anion transporters (44),
but it inhibits  xxxg1664xxx  channels
with the same potency. probenecid
is specific among “gap junction protein” inhibitors as channels composed of pannexins are affected,

well documented (20, 40). the mechanism of action, however, thought to be exclusively by inhibition of an organic anion

has been proposed that k⫹ efflux with commensurate reduc- blocking urate reuptake. the present findings suggest an addition in cytoplasmic k⫹ concentration is the trigger for the var- tional site of action for probenecid by attenuating signals in the
ious components of the inflammasome to assemble into the inflammatory response, possibly inhibiting activation of the
active macromolecular complex. however, it is debatable inflammasome.
disturbed ionic and neurotransmitter homeostasis contribwhether this mechanism is operative in vivo. in particular, in
tissues where the k⫹ efflux is into confined spaces then such a utes to secondary damage induced by traumatic brain injury,
mechanism seems unlikely. as is well known from excitable spinal cord injury, and stroke (46). atp and k⫹ released from

 xxxg340xxx -mediated conversion of pro-il-1␤, can be blocked or  xxxd1148xxx .  xxxg1567xxx -catalyzed nucleotide hydrolysis is vital for
without changes of k⫹ fluxes (41, 42). thus, there should be protein function and is required for  xxxg1567xxx  self-association,
another pathway for activation of the inflammasome.
interaction with asc and  xxxg340xxx , and il-1 cytokine
recent evidence indicates that  xxxg1664xxx  plays a crucial role release (47). in contrast, the nlrp1 inflammasome exhibits
in inflammation explicitly through its association with the little nucleotide specificity. because neurons contain the
p2x7 receptor (7, 43). knockdown of  xxxg1664xxx  by short inter- nlrp1 inflammasome (21) and not the  xxxg1567xxx  inflammafering rna attenuates the release of il-1␤ from stimulated some, it does not appear that atp released after cns injury

because membrane breakdown was observed after atp was an alternative model for  xxxg340xxx  activation where high

will be of interest to determine whether blocking the opening of  xxxg1664xxx  channels in response to high extracellular
k⫹ caused by traumatic injury inhibits inflammasome activation and release of il-1␤.
strategies now aimed at treating cns trauma focus on neuroprotection, enhanced regeneration, or treatment of demyelination. our study shows that neutralization of asc significantly blocks atp-induced cell death. moreover we have
recently shown that neutralization of asc significantly reduces
 xxxg340xxx  activation and processing of il-1␤ and il-18, resulting in significant improvement in tissue sparing and functional
recovery after spinal cord injury (21). thus,  xxxg1664xxx  and
inflammasome inhibition might offer a new therapy for treatment of atp-induced cell death observed in a variety of cns
insults and diseases.
