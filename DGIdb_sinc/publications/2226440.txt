cooperative homotropic interaction of  xxxd2750xxx  with the catalytic site of  xxxg1660xxx .  catecholamines (adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine) are potent inhibitors of  xxxg1660xxx  ( xxxg1660xxx ,  xxxg1660xxx ). the amines bind to the enzyme by a direct coordination to the high-spin (s = 5/2) fe(iii) at the active site (charge transfer interaction), as seen by resonance raman and epr spectroscopy. experimental evidence is presented that a group with an apparent pka value of about 5.1 (20 degrees c) is involved in the interaction between the catecholamine and the enzyme. the high-affinity binding of  xxxd2750xxx  to  xxxg1660xxx , as studied by equilibrium microdialysis (anaerobically) and ultrafiltration (aerobically), shows positive cooperativity (h = 1.9); at ph 7.2 and 20 degrees c the rat enzyme binds about 0.5 mol  xxxd2750xxx /mol subunit with a half-maximal binding (s50) at 0.25 microm  xxxd2750xxx . no binding to the ferrous form of the enzyme was observed. the affinity decreases with decreasing ph, by phosphorylation and by preincubation of the enzyme with the substrate l-phenylalanine, while it increases after alkylation of the enzyme with the activator n- xxxd2684xxx . preincubation of the enzyme with l-phenylalanine also leads to a complete loss of the cooperativity of  xxxd2750xxx  binding (h = 1.0). the many similarities in binding properties of the inhibitor  xxxd2750xxx  and the activator/substrate l-phenylalanine makes it likely that the cooperative interactions of these effectors are due to their binding to the same site. the high-affinity of catecholamines to  xxxg1660xxx  is a valuable probe to study the active site of this enzyme and is also relevant for the homologous enzyme  xxxg2276xxx , which is purified as a stable catecholamine-fe(iii) complex.
