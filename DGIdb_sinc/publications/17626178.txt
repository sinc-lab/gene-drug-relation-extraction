alcohol dependence is a disease that impacts millions of individuals worldwide. there has been some progress with pharmacotherapy for alcohol-dependent individuals; however, there remains a critical need for the development of novel and additional
therapeutic approaches. alcohol and nicotine are commonly
abused together, and there is evidence that neuronal nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors (nachrs) play a role in both alcohol and
nicotine dependence. varenicline, a partial agonist at the ␣4␤2
nachrs, reduces nicotine intake and was recently approved as a
smoking cessation aid. we have investigated the role of varenicline
in the modulation of ethanol consumption and seeking using three
different animal models of drinking. we show that acute administration of varenicline, in doses reported to reduce nicotine reward, selectively reduced ethanol but not sucrose seeking using an
operant self-administration drinking paradigm and also decreased
voluntary ethanol but not water consumption in animals chronically exposed to ethanol for 2 months before varenicline treatment. furthermore, chronic varenicline administration decreased
ethanol consumption, which did not result in a rebound increase in
ethanol intake when the varenicline was no longer administered.
the data suggest that the ␣4␤2 nachrs may play a role in
 xxxd102xxx seeking behaviors in animals chronically exposed to ethanol. the selectivity of varenicline in decreasing ethanol consumption combined with its reported safety profile and mild side effects
in humans suggest that varenicline may prove to be a treatment for
alcohol dependence.

a

lcohol dependence constitutes one of the most serious
public health problems worldwide. there are only three
medications available for the treatment of alcohol dependence;
disulfiram, acamprosate, and naltrexone. the opioid antagonist,
naltrexone, has demonstrated the most consistent effect in
reducing alcohol consumption in the context of behavioral
therapy (1). naltrexone has been shown to decrease ethanol
consumption in numerous animal (2–6) and clinical studies
(7–10) and has been shown to be more effective in heavy or
excessive drinkers (11). however, not all patients respond to
naltrexone, which is partly explained by genetic variations in the
␮ opioid receptor gene (12). furthermore, opioid receptor
antagonists decrease both ethanol and sucrose intake in rodents
(13, 14). alcohol dependence is a complex disorder that will
require the use of different therapeutic approaches to treat the
disease effectively.
environmental and genetic factors contribute to an individual’s risk of becoming dependent on drugs of abuse such as
ethanol and nicotine. approximately 85% of alcoholics smoke,
and it has been suggested that common genes control the
development of both alcohol and nicotine dependence (15).
furthermore, heavy drinkers tend to be heavy smokers, and
alcohol influences nicotine dependence (16). both nicotine and
ethanol can either directly or indirectly activate the brain reward
system through neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
(nachrs) (16–18). the nachrs are well characterized ligand12518 –12523 兩 pnas 兩 july 24, 2007 兩 vol. 104 兩 no. 30

gated ion channels that, in addition to mediating the rewarding
properties of nicotine, also regulate several central functions,
such as memory and attention, sleep and wakefulness, anxiety
and pain (19). the nachrs have received little attention despite
evidence that they play a role in the development of alcohol
dependence.
studies have shown that the nonselective nachr antagonist,
 xxxd2550xxx , decreases ethanol consumption in rats (20–22)
and attenuates  xxxd102xxx induced dopamine release in the nucleus
accumbens (21, 23, 24). furthermore,  xxxd2550xxx  has been
reported to block the stimulant or euphoric subjective effects of
alcohol and decreases the self-reported desire to consume more
alcohol in healthy human volunteers (25–27). acetylcholine
(ach) levels in the ventral tegmental area and dopamine levels
in the nucleus accumbens are increased in animals consuming
ethanol (28). changes in ach levels in the nucleus accumbens
have been suggested to be involved in modulating alcohol
withdrawal (29). these results suggest that the nachrs may be
involved in mediating the rewarding properties of ethanol;
however, the specific subunits of the nachr involved are not
known.
the nachrs are either homomeric or heteromeric pentameric ion channels, and the channels consist of different combinations of ␣2–␣10 and ␤2–␤4 subunits; the majority of nachrs
in the cns contain either ␣4␤2 heteromers or ␣7 homomers (30,
31). results from in vitro studies have shown that ethanol directly
activates the ␣4␤2 nachr (32–34). the ␣4 nachr gene may
influence some of the common actions of nicotine and ethanol
in the mouse because a polymorphism in the gene encoding the
␣4 subunit of the nachr ( xxxg456xxx ) is associated with ethanol
intake in animals (35) and modulates ethanol withdrawal (36)
and the ethanol effect on acoustic startle response (35, 37). this
finding suggests that the ␣4␤2 nachr may be involved in
mediating the rewarding effects of ethanol.
recently, varenicline, a partial agonist at the ␣4␤2 nachr
(38, 39), has been approved for marketing in the u.s. (as
chantix) and in more than 30 countries worldwide (as  xxxd3493xxx )
as an aid for smoking cessation (40–42). we have evaluated the role
of varenicline in modulating ethanol seeking and consumption.

of the ethanol (10%) or sucrose (5%) reward was contingent on
a visual (light) and auditory (3-s tone) cue. in addition, the rats
were trained to selectively press an active lever three times to
receive the ethanol or sucrose reward (see materials and methods). no reward was received if the rats pressed the inactive
lever, and the event was merely recorded as a measure of
nonspecific behavioral activity. when the rats had maintained a
stable level of responding over ⬇70 sessions (⬇5 months of
ethanol exposure), varenicline (0.3, 1, or 2 mg/kg s.c.) was
administered 30 min before the session. varenicline treatment
had an overall main effect on operant self-administration of 10%
ethanol [f (4,7) ⫽ 5.6, p ⬍ 0.001], and post hoc analysis revealed
that the doses of 1 and 2 mg/kg significantly inhibited operant
self-administration of 10% ethanol compared with vehicle (fig.
1a). to determine whether this effect was selective for ethanol,
we measured the effect of varenicline on natural reward seeking
(5% sucrose). when the rats had maintained a stable level of
responding over 70 sessions, varenicline (0.3, 1, or 2 mg/kg s.c.)
was administered 30 min before the session. varenicline treatment did not have an overall effect on the operant selfadministration of 5% sucrose [f (3,6) ⫽ 2.5, nonsignificant
(n.s.)]. the fact that varenicline did not decrease the number of
lever presses for 5% sucrose (fig. 1b) suggests that varenicline
does not significantly affect locomotor behavior but rather is
selective in reducing ethanol seeking by modulating the consummatory and/or the rewarding properties of ethanol.

using the operant self-administration paradigm, we then
compared the effects of varenicline with those of naltrexone,
currently the most effective treatment for alcoholism (1). naltrexone (1 mg/kg s.c.) significantly inhibited active lever presses
for both 10% ethanol and 5% sucrose in ethanol- and sucrosetrained animals compared with vehicle (fig. 2 a and b). responding on the inactive lever was not affected by naltrexone
treatment in either the 10% ethanol or the 5% sucrose trained
animals (data not shown). varenicline appears therefore to have
a preclinical pharmacological profile that is similar to naltrexone
with regard to efficacy but with improved selectivity for ethanol.
using the continuous-access two-bottle choice drinking paradigm, we also measured the effect of varenicline on ethanol
consumption and reward in rats (see materials and methods).
this paradigm differs significantly from the operant selfadministration paradigm because the rats consume the reward
on a voluntary basis; the reward is freely available, and its
delivery is neither contingent on specific behaviors (lever pressing) nor associated with discrete cues (light/tone). when the rats
had maintained a stable baseline consumption of 10% ethanol
for 8 weeks, varenicline (1 and 2 mg/kg s.c.), given 30 min before
access to 10% ethanol, significantly decreased ethanol consumption for up to 6 h. there was an overall main effect of varenicline
on ethanol consumption at 30 min [f (3,6) ⫽ 8.9, p ⬍ 0.001, fig.
3a] and at 6 h [f (3,6) ⫽ 7.7, p ⬍ 0.01, fig. 3b] compared with
vehicle. varenicline selectively decreased ethanol consumption
and did not have an overall effect on water consumption [f
(3,6) ⫽ 2.2, n.s., table 1] or total fluid intake [f (3,6) ⫽ 3.3, n.s.,
table 1] at the 6-h time point. ethanol consumption, water
consumption, and total fluid intake were not affected 24 h after
the varenicline injection [ethanol: f (3,6) ⫽ 1.6, n.s.; water: f
(3,6) ⫽ 1.3, n.s.; total fluid intake: f (3,6) ⫽ 2.8, n.s., table 1].
furthermore, the amount of ethanol consumed between 24 and
48 h after the varenicline administration did not differ from
ethanol consumption after vehicle treatment [f (3,6) ⫽ 0.58, n.s.,
table 1], which shows that a rebound increase in ethanol
consumption was not observed after varenicline treatment. the
main caveat with the continuous-access two-bottle choice paradigm is that a sucrose-fading technique is required to train the
rats to consume 10% ethanol and that when this training is
achieved, the animals consume only low to moderate quantities
of ethanol (0.6 g/kg in 30 min or 3 g/kg in 24 h).
to examine the effect of varenicline in high ethanolconsuming rats, we used the intermittent-access two-bottle

choice drinking paradigm, originally described by wise (43).
rats were given unlimited access to one bottle of ethanol (20%)
and one bottle of water for 24 h but only on alternate days (see
materials and methods). the amount of ethanol consumed was
increased 2-fold to ⬇1.3 g/kg in 30 min or 6 g/kg in 24 h compared
with the continuous-access two-bottle choice paradigm (0.6 g/kg
in 30 min or 3 g/kg in 24 h, respectively). when rats had
maintained a stable baseline level of ethanol consumption for 8
weeks (37 drinking sessions in total) varenicline (1 and 2 mg/kg)
decreased ethanol consumption for at least 24 h. there was an
overall main effect on the ethanol consumption in high ethanolconsuming rats at all time points examined [30 min: f (3,7) ⫽ 28,

0.01, respectively]. post hoc analysis revealed that doses of 1 and
2 mg/kg significantly decreased ethanol consumption in a dosedependent manner compared with vehicle at all time points (30
min, fig. 4a; 6 h, fig. 4b; 24 h, data not shown). water
consumption was not significantly affected by the varenicline
treatment at the 6-h time point [f (3,7) ⫽ 2.2, n.s.] compared
with vehicle treatment (table 2). however, varenicline had an
overall main effect on water consumption at the 24-h time point
[f (3,7) ⫽ 5.5, p ⬍ 0.01], and post hoc analysis showed that all
doses of varenicline increased water consumption 24 h after
dosing compared with vehicle (table 2).
to examine the effect of chronic administration of varenicline
on ethanol consumption, vehicle or varenicline was administered
to rats by using the intermittent-access two-bottle choice drinking paradigm. when two groups of rats had reached stable

baseline levels of ethanol consumption after 8 weeks (37 ethanoldrinking sessions in total), the effect of multiple injections of
varenicline or vehicle was measured. one group of rats received
varenicline (2 mg/kg s.c.), and the other group of rats received
vehicle, once per day for 6 consecutive days, and the ethanol
consumed was measured on days 1, 3, and 6 in both groups of
rats. varenicline but not vehicle treatment reduced ethanol
intake in rats on the  xxxd102xxx drinking days 1, 3, and 6. in the
varenicline-treated group, there was an overall main effect on
the ethanol consumption on days 1, 3, and 6 at all time points [30
min: f (3,4) ⫽ 13.2, p ⬍ 0.001, fig. 5a; 6 h: f (3,4) ⫽ 9.6, p ⬍
0.01, fig. 5b; 24 h: f (3,4) ⫽ 3.6, p ⬍ 0.05, data not shown]. post
hoc analysis revealed that varenicline decreased ethanol consumption compared with baseline ethanol consumption in all
drinking sessions during the varenicline treatment period at 30
min (fig. 5a), 6 h (fig. 5b), and 24 h (data not shown). when
the varenicline treatment was terminated on day 6, the postvarenicline treatment baseline  xxxd102xxx drinking levels returned
to the pretreatment baseline  xxxd102xxx drinking levels (fig. 5 a
and b). therefore, chronic varenicline treatment did not result
in a rebound increase in drinking at the end of the treatment
period. there was no overall main effect of vehicle on ethanol
consumption on day 1, 3, or 6 in the vehicle-treated group
compared with baseline drinking levels at all time points [30 min:

discussion
the results show that the partial ␣4␤2 nachr agonist varenicline, in doses reported to reduce nicotine reward (39), also
selectively reduced ethanol consumption and seeking in rats and
did not inhibit either sucrose seeking or water consumption. this
finding suggests that nachrs play a role in modulating ethanol
consumption and is supported by previous studies showing that
ethanol can activate the reward system either directly or indirectly by ach interacting with nachrs (for review, see ref. 17).
ach levels in the ventral tegmental area are increased in highbut not low-ethanol consuming rats (28), and the nonselective
nachr antagonist  xxxd2550xxx  decreases ethanol consumption in high-alcohol-preferring rats (20, 21) and blocks ethanolinduced dopamine release (21, 23, 24).
varenicline is a partial ␣4␤2 nachr agonist that binds with
greater affinity to ␣4␤2 nachrs (44) than either ach or nicotine
but with significantly less efficacy (38, 44), and varenicline is a
potent functional antagonist in the presence of nicotine (39).
results from in vitro (32–34) and genetic studies (35–37) show that
ethanol interacts directly with ␣4␤2 nachrs (30, 31). our data
suggest that varenicline reduces the efficacy of ach activity at
nachrs, leading to a reduction in ethanol intake by decreasing the
rewarding properties of ethanol. because varenicline is a partial
agonist at ␣4␤a2 nachrs, it is thought to act both as an antagonist

of nicotine, reducing the reward associated with smoking, and as an
agonist, providing relief from nicotine craving and withdrawal
symptoms during abstinence (38, 39). it is possible that varenicline
may reduce ethanol consumption through its ability to work as a
partial agonist at ␣4␤2 nachrs in the ventral tegmental area to
reduce dopamine release into the nucleus accumbens, but this
possibility remains to be determined.
the ␣4␤2 nachrs do not seem to have a major role in
modulating acute responses to ethanol because the ␣4␤2 nachr
antagonist, dihydro-␤-erythroidine, did not decrease voluntary
ethanol consumption in rats (22) and had no effect on ethanolinduced locomotor activity or  xxxd102xxx induced dopamine release
in mice or rats (45, 46). in contrast, in our work the animals were
exposed to ethanol from 2 to 5 months before the varenicline
treatment. long-term exposure of ethanol for 5 months has been
shown to increase significantly the number of nicotinic receptorbinding sites in the rat brain (47), and in vitro ethanol exposure
changes nachr expression and nachr channel-gating properties (48). this finding suggests that chronic ethanol consumption
may lead to changes in ␣4␤2 nachrs.
varenicline binds with at least 3 orders of magnitude higher
affinity to ␣4␤2 nachrs than to ␣3␤4, ␣3␤2, ␣6, and ␣7
nachrs (39) and is also a partial agonist at ␣3␤4, ␣3␤2, and ␣6
nachrs and a full agonist at ␣7 nachrs (44). however, it has
significantly lower affinity and functional activity at these other
subunits, with reported ec50 values ranging from 1.1 to 55 ␮m
(39, 44, 57). the relevance of in vitro binding affinities and in vitro
functional potencies for behavioral effects is not well understood; subunits other than ␣4␤2 nachrs may be involved. for
example, it has been reported that inhibition of ␣3␤2 nachrs
attenuates  xxxd102xxx induced locomotor behavior in mice (49),
and inhibiting ␣3␤4 nachrs decreases ethanol consumption in
alcohol-preferring rats (50). it cannot be excluded that varenicline interacts with either the ␣3␤2 and or ␣3␤4 nachrs to
decrease ethanol consumption; however, it is unlikely at the
doses used in our experiments.
varenicline appears to have a preclinical pharmacological
profile similar to that of naltrexone but with improved selectivity.
both acute and chronic administration of varenicline inhibits
ethanol consumption. chronic treatment with varenicline suppressed the ethanol consumption without any subsequent rebound increase in drinking. we administered varenicline once
per day; however, the half-life of varenicline in rats is ⬇4 h (51),
suggesting that a greater reduction in drinking may be observed
if varenicline is administered at least twice a day in animals. in
contrast, the half-life of varenicline in humans is 24 h (51), which
may prove to be a clinical advantage in the treatment of alcohol
dependence. the finding that varenicline decreased ethanol
consumption in chronically exposed  xxxd102xxx consuming rats
suggests that varenicline may serve as a therapeutic treatment to

reduce alcohol consumption in alcoholic subjects; however, this
remains to be examined. a clinical study in alcoholic subjects will
be possible because varenicline has been shown to be safe in
human subjects (52). furthermore, clinical studies show that
varenicline is a well tolerated drug (40–42) and can be administered for up to 1 year in smokers (52). in addition, ⬎90% of the
administered dose of varenicline is excreted unchanged in
humans and laboratory animals (51), a major advantage in the
treatment of alcohol dependence. varenicline may represent a
safe and effective treatment for alcohol dependence.

the long–evans rats were kept on a regular 12-h light/dark cycle
(lights on  xxxd2274xxx  a.m.). food and water were available ad libitum,
except for short periods during initial training in the operant
self-administration paradigm, as outlined below. all procedures
were preapproved by the gallo center institutional animal care
and use committee and were in accordance with national
institutes of health guide for the care and use of laboratory
animals (56).
operant self-administration. apparatus. testing was conducted in

standard operant conditioning chambers (coulbourn instruments, allentown, pa) enclosed in ventilated, sound-attenuating
cubicles. each chamber housed two retractable levers on the
right wall with a liquid dipper system placed centrally between
them. a house light was present on the wall opposite the levers
and remained on at all times during the operant session. stimulus
lights were present above each lever. an apparatus to emit a tone
under specific operant conditions was also present. upon correct
(active) lever press(es), the stimulus light above the active (right)
lever was illuminated for 3 s and was accompanied by a 3-s tone
to reinforce availability of reward in the dipper receptacle. the
dipper port was illuminated for 10 s while the dipper cup was
available. stimulus, fluid delivery, and operant responses were
all controlled and recorded by a computer (coulbourn instruments) by using graphic state 2.0 software.
operant self-administration training. before beginning the operant
self-administration training, 30 male long–evans rats were
randomly divided into two groups and exposed to either 10%
ethanol or 5% sucrose solution as the only liquid source in their
home cages for 3 days. the mean body weights were 185 ⫾ 2 g
and 212 ⫾ 2 g for the ethanol and sucrose groups, respectively,
at the start of training. rats were then fluid-restricted for 22 h
before being placed in the operant chambers for a 14-h overnight
session. during the overnight session, the rats were rewarded
with a reinforcer of 0.1 ml of a solution consisting of 10% (wt/vol)
sucrose or 5% sucrose, for the future ethanol and sucrose groups,
respectively, after a single lever press (fr1 protocol of reinforcement). during a session on the fr1 protocol, only the right
(active) lever was available for the rat to press to facilitate
learning. the start of a session was signaled by the onset of the
house light. in addition to the reinforcer, both a visual (light) and
auditory (3-s tone) stimuli cue were presented after a press on
the active lever. after the overnight session, the rats were trained
daily for 45 min on the fr1 protocol, and the rats were restricted
to 2-h water access after the behavioral session. once stable
responding levels were established, rats were given free access to
water in the home cage and continued on an fr1 schedule for
3–4 additional sessions. subsequently, training sessions were
reduced to 30 min, and the fr3 protocol of reinforcement was
introduced (i.e., three active lever presses required for 0.1-ml
reward). a second, inactive lever was also introduced at this
time. upon pressing the inactive lever, no reinforcer, tone, or
light or auditory stimuli were given, and the event was merely
recorded as a measure of nonspecific behavioral activity. once
a baseline level of pressing was established, 10% ethanol was
added to the 10% sucrose solution for the ethanol group. over
the next 8–10 sessions, the sucrose concentration was gradually
decreased (5%, 3%, 1.5%) until the rats responded on an fr3
schedule for 10% (vol/vol) ethanol without any sucrose (53).
rats from both the ethanol and sucrose group were kept on the
fr3 protocol with 10% (vol/vol) ethanol or 5% sucrose, respectively, as the reinforcer for ⬇70 sessions or 5 months before drug
testing.
the mean body weights were 586 ⫾ 13 g and 568 ⫾ 10 g for the
ethanol and sucrose groups, respectively, at the first varenicline
test session.

two-bottle choice drinking paradigms. all fluids were presented in

100-ml graduated glass cylinders with stainless-steel drinking
spouts inserted through two grommets in front of the cage 15 min
after the light went out in the reversed light/dark cycle room. the
placement of the ethanol bottle was alternated daily to control
for side preferences. bottles were weighed 30 min, 6 h, and 24 h
after the fluids were presented, and measurements were taken
to the nearest gram. water and total fluid intake were not
measured at the 30-min time point because of low baseline
consumption of water (1.3 ⫾ 0.3 ml/30 min). the weight of each
rat was measured daily to calculate the grams of ethanol intake
per kilogram of body weight.
continuous-access two-bottle choice drinking paradigm. after the acclimatization period, seven wistar rats (350 ⫾ 12 g) were given
access to a bottle containing a solution of 10% (vol/vol) ethanol
and 10% (wt/vol) sucrose and a separate water bottle. over the
next 12 days, the sucrose concentration was gradually decreased
(i.e., from 10% to 5%, 2%, and 0% sucrose) until rats had
continuous access to one bottle of 10% (vol/vol) ethanol and one
bottle of water. drug administrations began after the rats had
maintained stable baseline drinking levels (2.8 ⫾ 0.1 g/kg in 24 h)
of the 10% (vol/vol)  xxxd102xxx  for 8 weeks (10 weeks of
ethanol consumption including the sucrose-fading period). the
mean body weight was 510 ⫾ 20 g at the first varenicline test
session.
intermittent-access two-bottle choice drinking paradigm. the intermittent access 20% ethanol two-bottle choice drinking paradigm
was adapted from wise (43) and does not require sucrose fading.
on the monday after the end of the housing acclimatization
period, 18 wistar rats (275 ⫾ 4 g) were given access to one bottle
of 20% (vol/vol) ethanol and one bottle of water. after 24 h, the
ethanol bottle was replaced with a second water bottle that was
available for the next 24 h. this pattern was repeated on
wednesdays and fridays. all other days the rats had unlimited
access to water. drug administrations began after the rats had
maintained stable baseline drinking levels (6 ⫾ 1 g/kg) of the
20% (vol/vol)  xxxd102xxx  for 8 weeks [⬇12 weeks from day
1 of the experiment (37 drinking sessions)]. the mean body
weight was 530 ⫾ 20 g at the first varenicline test session. eight
of the rats in the intermittent-access two-bottle choice paradigm
were dedicated to the acute varenicline dosing experiment, and
10 of the rats were dedicated to the chronic dosing experiment.
varenicline and vehicle were administered as described below.
drugs and treatment schedules. ethanol and sucrose solutions were
prepared in tap water using 95% (vol/vol) ethanol (gold shield
chemical co., hayward, ca) and sucrose (fisher scientific, pittsburgh, pa), respectively. varenicline (6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-6,10methano-6h pyrazino[2,3-h][3]benzazepine tartrate) (38) was
generously provided by pfizer global research and development (groton, ct). naltrexone was purchased from sigma (st.
louis, mo).
all rats in the acute varenicline experimental groups (operant
self-administration, continuous-access and intermittent-access
two-bottle choice) received each of the four treatments (vehicle,
0.3, 1, and 2 mg/kg). the varenicline doses were chosen because
these doses have previously been shown to decrease nicotine
self-administration (39). within each treatment group in the
acute dosing experiments, each injection was given 7 days apart
by using a latin square design, and thus each rat served as its own
control.
in the chronic varenicline experiment (intermittent-access
two-bottle choice), two groups of rats received varenicline (2
mg/kg) or vehicle, respectively, for 6 consecutive days (wednesday through monday). during the 6 treatment days, the rats had
three  xxxd102xxx drinking sessions (day 1, wednesday; day 3, friday; and day 6, monday). the ethanol consumption on the first

drinking session after the last varenicline administration was
recorded as the posttreatment baseline drinking level.
all rats in the naltrexone groups were counterbalanced and
received one naltrexone (1 mg/kg) and one vehicle injection 7
days apart. the dose of 1 mg/kg was chosen because this dose has
previously been shown to decrease ethanol consumption in
rodents (4, 5, 54, 55).
varenicline and naltrexone were both dissolved in saline and
administered as a s.c. injection, in a volume of 1 ml/kg, 30 min
before ethanol and water bottles were presented or before the
start of the operant self-administration session. all drug solutions were prepared immediately before each injection.
