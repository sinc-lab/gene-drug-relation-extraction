opioid receptors are currently classified as m (mu: mop), d (delta: dop), k (kappa: kop) with
a fourth related non-classical opioid receptor for nociceptin/orphainin fq, nop. morphine is
the current gold standard analgesic acting at mop receptors but produces a range of variably
troublesome side-effects, in particular tolerance. there is now good laboratory evidence to
suggest that blocking dop while activating mop produces analgesia (or antinociception)
without the development of tolerance. simultaneous targeting of mop and dop can be
accomplished by: (i) co-administering two selective drugs, (ii) administering one non-selective
drug, or (iii) designing a single drug that specifically targets both receptors; a bivalent ligand.
bivalent ligands generally contain two active centres or pharmacophores that are variably separated by a chemical spacer and there are several interesting examples in the literature. for
example linking the mop agonist oxymorphone to the dop antagonist naltrindole produces a
mop/dop bivalent ligand that should produce analgesia with reduced tolerance. the type of
response/selectivity produced depends on the pharmacophore combination (e.g. oxymorphone
and naltrindole as above) and the space between them. production and evaluation of bivalent
ligands is an emerging field in drug design and for anaesthesia, analgesics that are designed not
to be highly selective morphine-like (mop) ligands represents a new avenue for the production
of useful drugs for chronic (and in particular cancer) pain.

acute pain is a very common presenting complaint in
primary and secondary care. chronic pain, on the other
hand, is a rather complex symptom associated with a
range of diseases and is particularly difficult to treat
effectively. chronic pain is one of the most common
symptoms associated with cancer, with a prevalence of
approximately 30 – 50% among patients who are undergoing active treatment for a solid tumour and 70 – 90%
among those with advanced disease.2 19 records show
that 88% of cancer patients in the last year of their life are
in pain and 47% of those treated for pain by their
general practitioner said their treatment only partially controlled their pain.2 19 from this description of chronic
cancer pain it is fair to state that, despite a wide range
of potential therapeutic targets, the control of cancer pain
is poor.

current classification of opioids and their receptors
(mop; m, dop; d, and kop; k) is summarized in table 1,
where it is worthy of note that the main target for analgesia is the mop receptor. indeed, in an elegant study by
kieffer and colleagues, mice in which the mop gene was
deleted did not display morphine-induced analgesia.36
a fourth receptor was identified by cloning,16 56 which
was abbreviated as nop, while the identification of its
endogenous peptide followed shortly, named nociceptin/
orphanin fq or n/ofq. the structure of the  xxxg1634xxx 
and the transduction pathways after its activation show

escalation with the potential to produce increased sideeffects and a vicious cycle develops with a sick patient at
the centre. selective kop or dop receptor agonists do not
possess some morphine-like side-effects such as constipation, respiratory depression, and addiction, but have a
side-effect profile of their own, that is diuresis, sedation,
and dysphoria for kop receptor ligands.67
in animal studies over the last decade, it has been
shown that when a mop receptor agonist (i.e. morphine)
is co-administered with a dop receptor antagonist (i.e.
naltrindole),1 then increased analgesia results with an
improved side-effect profile (tolerance and dependence).
moreover, in dop receptor knock-out, antisense oligodeoxynucleotide knock-down and preproenkephalin knockout mice, reduced morphine tolerance was reported.62 77 in
addition, highly selective kop receptor agonists produce
more side-effects than some of the newer mixed kop/
mop receptor agonists.5 one of the most potent mop
receptor agonists (mdan-21) is not a selective mop
receptor agonist but rather a newly designed mixed
mop-agonist/dop-antagonist, being 50 times more potent
than morphine.22 collectively, these data indicate a far
more complex pharmacology for opioid receptors than it
has previously been suggested. the challenge ahead is to
develop this multi-target strategy to produce new analgesics that retain a favourable side-effect profile in man.
from a practical perspective, multiple targeting can take
several forms and these are illustrated in figure 1. the simplest mechanism is to administer two drugs separately.
this can be accomplished with the existing battery of
ligands, for example oxymorphone as a mop agonist and
naltrindole as a dop antagonist. an alternative is to use a
non-selective single ligand that will interact with both
targets, for example ufp-505 (table 2, compound 4) that
interacts both with mop receptor as an agonist and dop
receptor as an antagonist. finally, and representing more of
a medicinal chemistry challenge, is to design a single bivalent ligand that interacts with both targets, for example an

pharmacologically this is not a classical opioid receptor,
as non-selective opioid antagonists (i.e. naloxone) display
negligible affinity. the international union of (basic and
clinical) pharmacology (iuphar) database of receptors
proposes that the  xxxg1634xxx  is considered as a nonopioid branch of the opioid receptor family.
opioids are the gold standard for acute pain and are
often used with some effect in chronic cancer pain.
however, there is a trade-off between good analgesia and
poor side-effect profile. indeed, tolerance to opioids (morphine) develops such that dose escalation is required
which increases the prevalence and severity of side-effects.
there is a need for morphine-like molecules with reduced
side-effects such as (i) tolerance liability, (ii) depressed
respiration, and (iii) reduced gastrointestinal motility.
in 1994 in an editorial in this journal we stated that ‘as
far as clinical anaesthetists are concerned, the “holy grail”
of profound analgesia without significant side-effects has
yet to be realized’.6 while there have been significant
advances in that time, the ‘holy grail’ remains unrealized.
in that editorial we also suggested that highly selective
mop receptor agonists were the future for modern analgesics. using the vast amount of post-cloning pharmacology
data now available we question the wisdom of developing
more morphine-like analgesics and explore the properties
of low-selectivity mixed opioid molecules (multitargeting) in the hope that these may produce new drug
prototypes to address clinical need in chronic pain.

why is multi-targeting important?
as noted above, long-term clinical use of opioids (mainly
mop receptor agonists) can cause a wide range of sideeffects such as respiratory depression, constipation, tolerance, and possibly dependence.64 tolerance leads to dose

oxymorphone/naltrindole ligand (see also fig. 2). it is true
to say that the whole animal endpoint would, in general, be
the same and using the examples above all combinations
have the potential to produce tolerance-free analgesia. one
important point to be considered in the design and use of
bivalent ligands is that their potency (agonist, antagonist,
or both) for the two targets should be roughly similar.

wide range of properties. a detailed review of the chemistry of these molecules has been recently published and is
beyond the scope of this article.12 bivalent ligands with a
variety of different opioid pharmacophores have been
developed, including ligands for mixed mop/ xxxg1634xxx  binding.35 46 some of the main groups are covered

a pharmacophore is defined by the international union of
pure and applied chemistry (iupac) as ‘an ensemble of
steric and electronic features that is necessary to ensure the
optimal supramolecular interactions with a specific biological target and to trigger (or block) its biological response’
(iupac recommendations 1998). ligands that have two
distinct binding properties can be found in the literature
under two different names; bivalent and bifunctional.
a bivalent ligand68 is a compound that possesses two distinct
pharmacophores in its structure (fig. 2). on the other hand, a
bifunctional ligand45 is a non-selective compound that acts at

two different targets and thus presents two distinct binding
properties. these terms are often used interchangeably and in
this review we will use the terms bivalent and non-selective
to describe the properties of several interesting ligands. two
sub-categories of bivalent ligands also exist: homobivalent
ligands, where both pharmacophores are of the same structure and heterobivalent ligands, where the two pharmacophores are different.66 it is possible that a bivalent ligand
may have only one function if both of its pharmacophores
are selective for the same receptor. in contrast, it may also be
possible that a bifunctional ligand can have only one pharmacophore which is non-selective and thus acts on two
different targets. for example, the non-selective opioid
receptor agonist butorphan acts on kop and mop receptors
and as it has only one pharmacophore, it is regarded as a
bifunctional (non-selective) ligand. similarly, the monovalent opioid-receptor ligands cyclorphan and pentazocine
act as agonists at kop receptors and antagonists at the
mop receptors are also bifunctional (non-selective)
ligands. morphy and rankovic have proposed a further
chemical sub-classification depending on whether the pharmacophores are merged, conjugated, or overlapping.59

amino-linker (-nh-nh-).48 81 it is known that endogenous
opioid peptides have a common tetrapeptide sequence
(tyr-gly-gly-phe), one amino acid different from the
pharmacophores in biphalin, and is a target for enzymatic
hydrolysis by aminopeptidases and enkephalinases.58
replacement of gly in position 2 of the opioid tetrapeptide sequence, with a d-ala, protects biphalin from enzymatic breakdown. biphalin has been shown to possess
higher in vitro affinity than  xxxg1801xxx  and produce
higher in vivo analgesia than morphine. its actions are
attributed to activation of both mop and dop receptors,
while it shows no affinity for the kop receptors.82
alterations of biphalin’s pharmacophores to exclude the
d-ala and gly amino acids causes a vast decrease in affinity for all receptors (table 3, compound 1). alteration of
the structure of biphalin to include a ch2-ch2-ch2 chain
between the -nh-nh- linker, produces a compound that
has much lower biological activity indicating that the
spacer plays a vital role in activity. elongation of the
linker causes further loss of mop receptor affinity, while
dop receptor affinity remains unaffected.12 indeed, in
vivo testing of biphalin analogues with the linker formula
– nh-(ch2)n-nh- (with n¼2 – 12), has shown inadequate
antinociception. this observation confirms the key role of
mop receptor affinity in analgesia, as all biphalin analogues with longer linkers than biphalin showed a reduced
mop/dop receptor activity ratio.20 further in vivo tests
have shown that biphalin diminishes physical dependence
after chronic i.p. morphine, a result that is attributed to
dop receptor activation. biphalin has increased metabolic
stability [t1/2 is 87 min (serum) and 112 min (brain)] and

the synthesis of a series of bivalent ligands with two
butorphan pharmacophores and varying linker lengths
(mcl-139, mcl-144, mcl-145).61 these bivalent compounds have receptor affinities that are dependent on the
type or length of the spacer between the pharmacophores.
mcl-139 and mcl-144 have 4- and 10-carbon atom
linkers, respectively, and both were full kop receptor agonists and partial agonists at the mop receptor.53 the longlinker bivalent ligand mcl-144 has the highest affinity for
kop receptors (ki¼0.049 nm; table 3, compound 4)53
and its diastereoisomer mcl-193 (with the one pharmacophore being enantiomerically inactive) has reduced kop
receptor affinity (ki¼1.2 nm; table 3, compound 5).52
mcl-450 is a bivalent ligand with dmt-tic and butorphan
pharmacophores (table 3, compound 6).60 although its
profile shows affinity for all opioid receptors, there are distinguishable differences in affinity when compared with its
monomeric pharmacophores, dmt-tic and butorphan.
mcl-450 has lower affinity for mop receptors than butorphan, lower affinity for dop receptors than dmt-tic
(table 3,  xxxd774xxx ) but higher affinity for dop receptors than butorphan.60 however, its affinity for the kop
receptor is vastly increased compared with that of
dmt-tic, although lower than that of butorphan (data not
shown).

simultaneous targeting of multiple opioid receptors

to binaltorphimine (bni) which has a methyl group linked
in the pyrrole ring, rather than hydrogen compared with
norbni.70 although naltrexone is a non-selective opioid
antagonist, norbni and bni are more kop receptor selective, probably because of the presence of the short nonflexible pyrrole ring as a spacer. a bivalent ligand that
includes one inactive (þ)naltrexone enantiomer has shown
1/30th of the potency shown for the (2)/(2)naltrexone bivalent ligand.67 this increase in affinity may suggest a significant role for the pharmacophoric spatial orientation in
bivalent ligands.

increased resistance to enzymatic degradation when compared with met5-enkephalin, two characteristics that relate
to biphalin’s long analgesic activity.12 mouse-tail flick
tests have shown that when biphalin is administered s.c. or
i.v., it produces inferior analgesia to morphine. the opposite is true for the intrathecal route, where biphalin has
increased potency when compared with morphine,57 82
suggesting that s.c. or i.v. biphalin undergoes some enzymatic breakdown in the periphery before entering the
central nervous system (cns) and therefore shows
decreased activity, compared with intrathecal administration.82 drugs such as biphalin, with limited cns
activity through the s.c. route, may be useful as local
analgesics where central effects are undesirable.58 82

(a ‘þ’ enantiomer) with an active oxymorphone pharmacophore (a ‘2’ enantiomer).71 the ligand incorporating the
(þ)enantiomer pharmacophore showed 20% of the activity
of that containing both active pharmacophores, a similar
observation to butorphan bivalent ligands (table 3, compounds 4 and 5). the reduction in bioactivity shows that the
bivalent molecule activates two different receptors and
therefore the ligand bridges two receptor sites through
binding. it is unclear whether these two bridged receptor
sites are part of a receptor dimer complex (dimerization is
discussed in a later section) or simply neighbouring receptors.12 other morphine-related pharmacophores have also
been used in the synthesis of bivalent compounds (table 3,
compound 10) in order to increase the activity of an
additional target (i.e. dop or kop receptor). similarly,
some bifunctional compounds that are structurally-related to
morphine have also shown an interesting activity profile
when combined with morphine. for example, nalbuphine, a
mop antagonist and a kop agonist, is almost as potent an
analgesic as morphine.50 this bifunctional compound has
shown analgesic synergy and reduced pruritus in patients,
when combined with morphine at a 1:1 ratio.87 the mechanism behind the cross-linking of the activity of mop antagonists with mop agonists after co-administration needs
further investigation.

naltrexone-related pharmacophores
naltrexone and naloxone (table 3, compound 17) are two
structurally related non-selective opioid antagonists. when
two naltrexone pharmacophores are linked by a glycyl-rich
spacer, a remarkably long-lasting antagonism of the antinociceptive activity of morphine results.83 norbinaltorphimine
(norbni) is a rigid opioid bivalent ligand with two naltrexone pharmacophores linked by a pyrrole ring.72 norbni is a
potent selective kop receptor antagonist, structurally similar

kdan series of ligands
portoghese and colleagues proposed a similar nomenclature
to the mdan bivalent ligands, this time for kop and dop
receptor selectivity, naming the series as kdan (kd; k for
k-receptor, d for d-receptor).13 multiple ligands with different numbers of atoms in their linker (noted again as

naltrindole (nti) (table 3,  xxxd774xxx ) is a potent dop
receptor antagonist, structurally related to naltrexone.
co-administration of morphine and nti has been shown to
suppress opioid-related physical dependence and tolerance
in mice, along with increasing analgesia.3 independent
studies using dop receptor knock-out mice have shown
reduced opioid tolerance without an effect on analgesia.62
these data led to the synthesis of a series of bivalent
ligands, that bear one oxymorphone pharmacophore (a mop
receptor agonist) and one nti pharmacophore, denoted as
the mdan series of bivalent ligands (m for mop receptor,
d for dop receptor, a for agonist, n for antagonist).
mdan-21, a compound with the specified pharmacophores
and a 21-atom linker between them, has shown that it
reduces tolerance and physical dependence of morphine in
vivo, while showing a 50-fold increase in potency at mop
receptors, compared with that of morphine (mdan-21 i.c.v.
ed50 0.08 nm, morphine i.c.v. ed50 4.1 nm).22
chronic administration of mdan-21 abolishes conditioned place preference (cpp) used to predict drug addiction and abuse.41 each one of the pharmacophores used in
the mdan-21 ligand, when attached individually to a
linker (one pharmacophore only connected to a linker), displays a cpp profile similar to that of morphine. these data
endorse the theory that mdan bivalent ligands promote
antinociception with decreased addiction compared with
morphine.22 41 in addition, it has been shown that morphine
cpp can be terminated after a long abstinence period but
re-instated by repeated injection, which kindles drugseeking behaviour. this behaviour is not present with
mdan ligands.41 therefore, mdan ligands may be used
not only as antinociceptive agents with reduced addictive
properties but also as therapeutic alternatives for already
addicted patients.12 tables 2 and 3 include ligands with
affinity at the mop and dop receptors.

cell line when compared with mixed membranes of singleexpressing cell lines. the monovalent ligands ici-199 441
and naltrindole possessed much lower affinity for all receptors, when either co-expressed or mixed.67 the optimum
spacer length of 18 atoms for the kdan ligands
(kdan-18) is believed to favour interdimeric bridging of
two active sites (one receptor from each of two neighbouring receptor-dimers) rather than intradimeric bridging (two
receptors in a receptor-dimer).21 however, stereochemical
and binding data show that such complicated bridging is
less possible and more energy-demanding (fig. 3, part 6).

factors affecting bivalent opioid properties
in addition to the pharmacophore chemistry, two other
factors that affect optimum interaction of bivalent ligands
and receptor binding sites are the spacer type/length and
the pharmacophore type/number.66

spacer type and length
as noted earlier spacer type and length between the two
pharmacophores is a factor that affects the interaction of a
bivalent ligand with its receptor targets.65 it has been
suggested that optimum binding occurs when spacer
length corresponds to the distance between the active sites

fig 3 schematic representation of possible binding combinations (1– 6) to opioid receptor dimers with respective ligands. two different opioid
receptors (blue and orange) constitute a heteromeric receptor dimer. the pharmacophores a and b of the bivalent ligand a– b (see also fig. 2) are
selective for their respective receptors (blue for a, orange for b) and are linked together through an intermediate spacer. when successful binding
occurs, an appropriate—but not necessarily identical—response is evoked (represented by the ‘thunderbolt’ sign under the receptors) through activation
of g protein. the schema assumes that the g protein associated with each receptor can trigger a response when activated by pharmacophore binding.
(1) bivalent ligand a –b binds to the receptor dimer blue –orange, using both of its pharmacophores for a perfect match. (2) one pharmacophore (a)
of the bivalent ligand a –b binds to the respective receptor monomer (blue). (3) replacement of pharmacophore b with an inactive (þ)enantiomer
(þb) causes only the binding of pharmacophore a, leaving pharmacophore þb unbound because of its stereochemical divergence. (4) binding of
pharmacophore a, combined with binding of an endogenous opioid ligand c, could possibly leave pharmacophore b unbound. individual
pharmacophore affinities and concentration gradients play a crucial role for the competition of b and c over the red-receptor active site. (5) two
endogenous opioids (d and e) bind to an opioid receptor dimer. the evoked response should theoretically be the same as that from combination-1. (6)
stereochemical orientation bridging of two receptors from neighbouring receptor-dimers is less likely to be successful because of the spatial
disorientation of pharmacophores relatively to their active sites. the bivalent ligand a– b cannot take the optimum orientation in order to bridge
neighbouring receptors, no matter what rotation its approach takes.

numbers in the series) have been studied, producing the
kdn series of ligands [both pharmacophores as (n) antagonists] and kdan series (a kop agonist and a dop antagonist pharmacophore).67 tables 2 and 3 include ligands with
affinity at the dop and kop receptors. kdn-21, a compound with a spacer length of 21 atoms, has been shown to
antagonize the k1-receptor agonist bremazocine, while
weakly antagonizing the k2-receptor agonist u50488
and potently antagonizing the d1-receptor agonist dpdpe.
the data confirm the suggestion that the k1-d2 or the k2-d1
putative receptors represent the k-d receptor heterodimer
which, in the presence of the kdn and kdan ligands,
are bridged.13 hek cell-lines expressing either kop and
dop receptors or cell-lines co-expressing both kop and
dop receptors were used to study two ligands: kdn-20
and kdn-21. these displayed a 120- and 200-fold higher
affinity, respectively, for the co-expressed receptor when
compared with single-expressing systems.13 73 86 the
authors of these reports interpreted the data based on the
existence of dop-kop heteromers in the co-expressed cell
lines. bivalent ligands with a k1-receptor agonist ici-199
441 and a dop receptor antagonist naltrindole as pharmacophores have also been synthesized (kdan series) and evaluated after intrathecal administration in tail flick assays and
in binding studies.21 kdan-18 showed a maximum of
65-fold higher affinity for a co-expressing dop-kop hek

simultaneous targeting of multiple opioid receptors

pharmacophore type and number
specific strategies are being used to define the role and
function of the presence of a second pharmacophore in a
bivalent ligand. three compounds are usually tested: (i) a
single pharmacophore, (ii) a single pharmacophore attached
to a spacer, and (iii) two pharmacophores linked with a
spacer. studies have shown that for most pharmacophores,
type (ii) ligands usually show lower affinity for the receptor
than (iii) or even (i). this observation is attributed to steric
hindrance of the active site by the spacer chain.65
the choice of using either non-peptidic or peptidic opioid
pharmacophores also contributes to bioactivity and physical characteristics. non-peptidic ligands have increased
resistance to enzymatic degradation and thus possess an
advantage for accessing the cns after peripheral administration.12 opioid receptors are highly selective for the
opiate enantiomeric pharmacophores. the (þ) isoforms of
opiate pharmacophores show lower affinity than their (2)
counterparts [i.e. (þ)morphine displays 1000-fold lower
affinity than (2)morphine71]. the utilization of enantiomeric forms (isoforms) of the pharmacophores in bivalent
ligands provides an additional tool for studying receptorbinding and activation. the (2) pharmacophores bind to
the receptor but their stereochemistry is probably responsible for the loss in affinity and reduction in potency.69 71
bivalent ligands containing both (2) and (þ) pharmacophores (noted as a 2/þ ligands) show a significant
decrease in activity, compared with the homologous 2/2
ligands. as only one of the two pharmacophores of the
2/þ ligand has affinity for the receptor, the potency of the
ligand might be expected to be half that of the 2/2
ligand.69 71 this can be true if the bivalent ligand bridges
two neighbouring, but not associated receptors, as associated receptors interact in a different manner. nevertheless,
what we see in practice is not a halved potency in the 2/þ
ligands. for example, the activity of the opioid 2/2 bivalent ligand is increased from five-fold (in the case of two
oxymorphone pharmacophores) to 30-fold (in the case of
norbni ligands) compared with their respective 2/þ analogues.14 this disproportional increase in activity of 2/2
ligands compared with 2/þ ligands could imply the bridging of two active sites that are found in a receptor
complex (dimer). the binding of one pharmacophore to
one receptor causes a conformational change that possibly
affects the binding of the second receptor in a positive

dimerization and bivalent opioid ligands
the role of receptor dimerization
pharmacological data from independent research groups in
the past have suggested the existence of different opioid
receptor ‘subtypes’ ( putative opioid receptors d1, d2, k1,
k2, etc.),32 based primarily on the pharmacological profiles
taken by the combination of different agonists and antagonists. whilst molecular biology has identified the existence of only three genes for the opioid receptors,24 27
multiple splice variants of these genes have been found.
whether these splice variants or different post-translational
modifications of the original gene products are the explanation for the observed pharmacological diversity, is
unclear. the carboxyl-terminal splicing of the rat mop
receptor has been shown, for example, to modulate receptor internalization and resensitization, rather than its
pharmacological profile.37 the traditional view of opioid
receptors sees a single receptor (mop, dop or kop)
working alone. however, the mixed pharmacological profile
seen for some of the proposed opioid receptor ‘subtypes’,
has led to studies that focused on opioid receptor association, co-localization, and oligomerization, as possible
mechanisms of explaining the distinct pharmacological profiles found. further studies using immunoaffinity and immunoprecipitation assays have confirmed that opioid receptors
not only dimerize in various combinations but mostly exist
as receptor dimers and not monomers, in a variety of different tissues.33 other studies have confirmed that dimerization
modulates receptor function and that different receptor
dimers possess distinct pharmacological profiles.34 based
on studies in the spinal cord of mice portoghese and lunzer
characterized the putative d1 and k2 opioid receptor as a
dop-kop heteromeric receptor.73 in addition, other studies

allosteric manner; hence, the disproportional increase in
activity of the bivalent ligand.69 of interest, similar molecules that have different stereochemical orientation
(owing to one -c-addition) may show the opposite pharmacological activity profile for a given receptor (i.e. table 2,
compounds 4 and 5, showing both a mop receptor
agonist activity but opposite dop receptor activity).75 the
use of ligands that contain enantiomeric moieties (thus
different stereochemistry) can reveal the role of the stereochemical orientation of its moiety to the compound’s
activity.49 52 71 in addition, hydrophobic or aromatic groups
embedded in the structure of non-selective dop/mop
receptor ligands enhance the interaction with their respective receptors.78 for example, in the non-selective ligand
that incorporates one dmt-tic pharmacophore linked to
-gly-nh-ch2-, when benzyimidazole (bid) addition is
compared to phenyl (ph) addition there is a marked loss of
mop affinity with no change in dop affinity76 (table 2,
compounds 4 and 7).

of the respective vicinal or dimeric receptors, although
this supposition will need rigorous experimental validation. molecular modelling of opioid receptor dimers
shows that the distance between the monomers with an
interface in transmembrane domains (tm) 5-6-7 is around
27 å, while those with a tm 4-5 interface are 32 å.69
physiochemical spacer characteristics (hydrophobicity,
molecular size, flexibility, and vulnerability to enzymatic
cleavage) also affect the efficacy of bivalent ligands.8

dietis et al.

ligand thermodynamics are believed to favour binding of
the ligand to receptor dimers rather than receptor monomers, suggested by the disproportional increase in affinity
and potency of bivalent over monovalent ligands.74 it has
been postulated that bivalent ligands can bridge the space
between receptor dimers and therefore may activate both
receptors simultaneously. this simultaneous binding indicates an important role of linker type/length connecting
the two pharmacophores, discussed above. molecular
modelling and binding studies with bivalent ligands have
suggested that the optimum length between the active sites
of receptors within a dimer is around 25 å for most opioid
receptor dimers.13 69 86 however, a few studies have shown
different optimum linker lengths for the same bivalent
ligands after testing in different cell models. these data
may indicate an effect of cell background on receptor
dimerization. nevertheless, dual activation of two receptor
active sites by one bivalent molecule is considered a thermodynamically favourable interaction over monovalent
binding.69
portoghese and colleagues suggest that there may be a
more complex relationship between receptors and bivalent
ligands. homodimerization of different receptors (dop –
dop, kop – kop, and mop – mop) favours their neighbouring association and thus bivalent agents may bridge
two receptors from different receptor – dimer complexes22
(fig. 3). although there are no studies confirming favourable association of receptor dimers, high expression levels
may promote such clustering. higher order oligomers have
also been suggested to affect receptor function, although it
has been shown that tetramers are formed as a result of
oligomerization of two different dimers, rather than clustering of four individual receptors.40

bivalent ligands and receptor dimers
as noted above, heterobivalent ligands have been shown
to possess a higher affinity for their respective receptors
when using cell membranes from cells that co-express the
two receptors, rather than from a mixture of membranes
from cells that express the individual receptors.12 in
addition, various reports mention an increase in the
activity and selectivity of bivalent ligands when compared
with data from individual binding of their monomeric
pharmacophores. these data are open to interpretation
and we discuss this further with respect to receptor
dimerization. we would stress that much of this general
discussion requires experimental evaluation. bivalent

suggest that the d2 and k1 phenotypes might represent
neighbouring associated d and k receptors.42 two different
receptor dimerization mechanisms have been proposed:
constitutive dimerization [where dimers are constructed in
the endoplasmic reticulum (er) after rna translation], and
ligand-induced dimerization (forming on the cell membrane), where dimers are formed on the cell membrane in
response to the presence of specific ligands.30 opioid receptor dimers have been shown to be formed mainly through
constitutive dimerization.55 although it has been shown that
opioid receptor dimers are coupled allosterically without
compromising their binding sites, the binding of a ligand to
one active site can cause a conformational change of the
receptor that could affect the second binding site.69 this
effect may be positive or negative (positive or negative
cooperativity). portoghese proposes the existence of two
recognition sites in an opioid receptor dimer, which modulates receptor activation and antagonism.69

it is clear from the description above that currently there is
a wide range of bivalent ligands available. while some
can be useful as experimental tools, most are not suitable
as models for further clinical development and therefore
further studies are needed. bivalent ligands, as a class of
compounds, have the advantage of single drug administration and this has implications for reduced drug – drug
interactions and more practically for patient compliance.
in addition, there is good evidence that some bivalents
have an improved pharmacological profile.12 the potential
in vivo profiles of the various combinations of pharmacophores in bivalent ligands are illustrated in figure 4.
of the many ligands described in this review, we are particularly interested in bivalent ligands with mop-agonist
activity and dop-antagonist activity. such molecules show
not only an increased antinociception and reduced tolerance
when compared with morphine, but also decreased physical
dependence,1 reduced respiratory depression,25 and
decreased gastrointestinal inhibition.12 the development of
opioid bivalent ligands can also be useful in areas of clinical
pharmacology other than analgesia. for example, one of the
current therapeutic strategies already used in cocaine abuse
is the co-administration of kop receptor antagonists with
mop receptor agonists. an opioid bivalent ligand that
incorporates the activities of the two individual agents could
provide a pharmacodynamic/kinetic advantage and therefore
reduced side-effects. nevertheless, the bulk of this work is
grounded in anaesthetic pharmacology–medicinal chemistry–small animal behavioural studies. the real test and
challenge will be taking suitable molecules into our most
important species, humans.
