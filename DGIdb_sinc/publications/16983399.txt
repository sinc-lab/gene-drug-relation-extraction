the underlying mechanisms of antipsychotic (ap)-induced weight gain are
unknown, but both central and peripheral ap target receptors could
potentially be involved. this study used radioligand binding assays to
compare the binding affinities of clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol for
candidate receptors potentially involved in ap-induced weight gain. selected
candidates derived from known pathways involved in body weight
regulation included receptors classified as anorexigenic ( xxxg977xxx  receptor
subtype 3, calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, cholecystokinin
receptor, melanocortin-4 receptor,  xxxg1618xxx  receptor 1) or orexigenic
( xxxg479xxx , galanin 1 receptor, melanin-concentrating  xxxg1603xxx  (mchr), neuropeptide y1 receptor) as well as receptors
involved in physiological actions related to digestion and fluid homeostasis
( xxxg99xxx  type 1 receptor,  xxxg258xxx , endothelin receptor,
 xxxg2240xxx  receptor, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor 1).
clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol exhibited negligible affinities to all
of these receptors except for the mchr (ki ¼ 501 nm; haloperidol). with
respect to other candidates from (neuro)transmitter systems already
suggested to be involved in ap-induced weight gain, the binding profile of
olanzapine resembled that of clozapine, with high affinity (kio10 nm) for
serotonin (5-ht) 5-ht2a, 5-ht2c and  xxxg1119xxx , muscarinic m1 and histamine
h1 receptors. in contrast, the binding profile of haloperidol was substantially
different (high affinity only for the  xxxg655xxx ). in conclusion, we
have not identified a novel binding site of the two investigated atypical ap
that could contribute to the induced weight gain.

weight gain occurs in up to 50% of patients under chronic administration of
antipsychotics (ap).1 weight gain not only impairs physical health but also
reduces treatment compliance and may cause adverse psychosocial consequences. although there is generally marked variability in incidence and severity
of weight gain among the various ap, especially the atypical ap clozapine and
olanzapine are associated with this side effect.1–3 the underlying mechanisms are

unknown, but genetic factors are seemingly involved.4 in
clinical studies, clozapine has been associated with increments in appetite, carbohydrate craving5 and binge eating
episodes,6–8 suggesting a change in energy intake. currently,
the effects of ap on energy expenditure have been less well
studied. in prospective clinical studies, olanzapine-induced
weight gain was associated with an increase in caloric
intake,9 whereas resting energy expenditure did not change
over the observation periods of four9 and 1210 weeks. in
contrast, an observation in three patients treated with
clozapine revealed a reduction of resting metabolic rates
by 10.3–16.0% within 1 month.11
because ap bind to many neurotransmitter receptors in
human brain, the multiple therapeutic and adverse effects
of various ap may depend on the combination of receptors
occupied.12 the effect of genetic variation of diverse
candidate receptor genes implicated in weight gain has
been investigated.13–20 for example, the 759c/t polymorphism of the serotonin (5-ht)  xxxg1115xxx  gene was
studied in patients with weight gain upon use of clozapine14,18–21 or other ap.17,22,23 however, as yet unknown
pharmacodynamic (including both central and peripheral
ap target receptors) and pharmacokinetic (i.e. enzymes that
metabolize ap) factors may be involved in ap-induced
weight gain. so far, research into this side effect was based
on the binding profiles of ap and has thus primarily focused
on classical neurotransmitter receptors such as dopaminergic, serotonergic, histaminergic, muscarinic and/or adrenergic receptors; the role of peripherally and centrally acting
hormones and peptides involved in body weight regulation
is largely unknown.1,3,13,15,16
factors implicated in the susceptibility to clozapine- or
olanzapine-related weight gain include leptin6,24–26 and
ghrelin.26–28 we found no evidence for a direct peripheral
effect of clozapine on fat-cell formation or production of
leptin and other fat-cell-derived factors.29 the increase in
serum leptin levels under treatment with ap is most likely
secondary to weight gain and seemingly not mechanistically
involved.25 additionally, other changes in biological parameters related to body weight, such as tumor necrosis factoralpha (tnf-alpha), soluble tnf receptors and interleukin-6
(il-6) may be involved in ap-induced weight gain.30 the
rapidly evolving knowledge derived from molecular obesity
research benefits the identification of peripherally and
centrally acting hormones and peptides involved in body
weight regulation and/or fluid homeostasis. the investigation of such peptides and receptors involved in body weight
regulation may be a promising approach to investigate the
mechanisms potentially underlying ap-induced weight
gain. candidates derived from known pathways involved
in body weight regulation include receptors classified as
anorexigenic (such as  xxxg977xxx  receptor subtype 3, calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, cholecystokinin receptor,
melanocortin-4 receptor,  xxxg1618xxx  receptor 1)31,32 or
orexigenic (such as  xxxg479xxx , galanin 1
receptor,

(mchr), neuropeptide y1 receptor).31,33 additionally, it

actions related to digestion and fluid homeostasis (such as
 xxxg99xxx  type 1 receptor,  xxxg258xxx ,
endothelin receptor,  xxxg2240xxx  receptor, vasoactive
intestinal polypeptide receptor 1)34–38 could be involved in
weight changes observed under treatment with ap.
in the present article, we have attempted to investigate
the potential involvement of several central and peripheral
receptors in ap-induced weight gain by using commercially
available radioligand binding assays (cerep, 86600 celle l‘
evescault, france). it was hypothesized that the differential
binding profiles of typical and atypical ap may contribute
to differences demonstrated with respect to weight gain. we
therefore explored the binding affinities of clozapine and
olanzapine in comparison with those of haloperidol, a
typical ap that causes relatively low weight gain.2,3 based on
the cerep offer, we chose (1) receptors of diverse peripherally and centrally acting hormones and peptides derived
from known pathways involved in body weight regulation
and related to digestion and fluid homeostasis; (2) receptors
of other candidates from (neuro)transmitter systems already
suggested to be involved in ap-induced weight gain.

materials and methods
radioligand binding assays were performed at cerep,
poitiers, france and included (1) 14 potential candidates
known from pathways involved in body weight regulation
or related to digestion and fluid homeostasis (see table 1) as
well as (2) 17 candidates of the serotonergic, dopaminergic,
muscarinic, histaminergic and adrenergic transmitter systems (see table 2).
the binding assay methods are summarized in supplementary table 1. following incubation, the membranes or
cells in suspension were rapidly filtered under vacuum
through glass fiber filters (gf/b, packard or filtermat a or b,
wallac (now perkinelmer, inc., boston, ma, usa)). filters
were then washed several times with an ice-cold buffer using
a cell harvester (packard or tomtec). bound radioactivity
was measured with a scintillation counter (topcout, packard
or betaplate, wallac) using a liquid scintillation cocktail
(microscint 0, packard) or a solid scintillant (meltilex b/hs,
wallac).

experimental protocols
the three test compounds (clozapine, haloperidol hcl,
olanzapine) were dissolved at 1 mm in dimethylsulfoxide
(dmso) and shipped to cerep. the compounds were first
tested in all assays at 1 mm. if the compounds caused more
than 50% inhibition of the specific binding at this
concentration, they were further tested at 0.1 mm. if they
again inhibited more than 50% of the specific binding at
this concentration, they were finally tested at 0.01 mm. each
determination was made in duplicate. in each experiment,
the respective reference compound was tested at a minimum
of eight concentrations in duplicate to obtain a competition
curve in order to validate the experiment.

analysis and expression of results
the specific radioligand binding to the receptors is defined
as the difference between total and nonspecific binding
determined in the presence of an unlabelled ligand. ic50
values (concentration causing a half-maximal inhibition of
control specific binding) and hill coefficients (nh) were
determined for the reference compounds by nonlinear
regression analysis of their competition curves. these
parameters were obtained by hill equation curve fitting.
the ic50 values obtained for the reference compounds are
within accepted limits of historic averages obtained 70.5
log unit. the ic50 values were converted to the affinity
constants (ki values) by application of the cheng–prusoff
equation: ki ¼ ic50/[1 þ l/kd], where l is the concentration
of radiolabelled ligand (agonist or antagonist) and kd is its
affinity for the receptor of the membrane preparation.39
comparison to binding data derived from the literature
in order to compare the results of our study to binding data
derived from the literature, a review of published binding
data that integrates data from different sources, including
medline/pubmed and websites such as the ‘information
system for g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs)’,40 was

performed. because findings across studies vary significantly
in methodology, with the use of different receptor/tissue
sources, radioligands, or in vitro assay conditions, we
converted the binding data from the literature40–59 into
semiquantitative categories (no or low affinity, moderate
affinity, high affinity; see table 2) to provide better
comparability.

discussion
ap-induced weight gain is a clinically relevant side effect.
the mechanisms by which weight gain occurs are unknown.
both central and peripheral ap target receptors (pharmacodynamic level) and enzymes that metabolize ap (pharmacokinetic level) may be involved in ap-induced weight
gain.13,15,16 this study primarily aimed at investigating the
binding affinities of the atypical ap clozapine and olanzapine in comparison with the typical ap haloperidol for
selected candidate receptors for ap-induced weight gain.
first, we investigated selected candidates derived from the
known pathways involved in body weight regulation. these
included receptors for ligands with anorexigenic and
orexigenic action as well as receptors involved in physiological actions related to digestion and fluid homeostasis (see
table 1). with the exception of the mchr, to which low
affinity binding of haloperidol was detected (ki ¼ 501 nm),
clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol exhibited negligible
affinities to all other receptors. the results suggest that these
candidate receptors do not play a significant part in the
direct pharmacological action of clozapine, olanzapine and
haloperidol. however, research into specific physiological
roles of neuropeptides has remained elusive after several
decades of research, but transmitter-like, trophic and
modulatory actions are seen for most peptides. thus,
because of multiple interactions, an indirect involvement
of these central and peripheral ap target receptor systems in
ap-induced weight gain cannot be excluded. finally, it
remains possible that ap bind to distinct receptors involved
in weight regulation, which were not investigated in the
current study.
second, we investigated candidates from (neuro)transmitter
systems already suggested to be involved in ap-induced weight
gain (see table 2). with respect to these receptors, the
binding profile of olanzapine resembled that of clozapine,
with high affinity for serotonin 5-ht2a and  xxxg1119xxx , muscarinic m1 and histamine h1 receptors, and moderate affinity
for dopamine (d1, d5) and muscarinic (m4, m5) receptors. in
contrast, the binding profile of haloperidol was substantially
different, with no or low affinity for the latter receptors
except the dopamine (d1, d5)-binding sites. because clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol all have moderate to high
affinity for the dopamine (d1, d5) sites, these receptors are
unlikely to contribute to the differences in weight gain
observed between these drugs.2 hence, the different binding
profiles of clozapine and olanzapine in comparison to
haloperidol makes the serotonin 5-ht2a, 5-ht2c and  xxxg1112xxx , muscarinic m1 and histamine h1 receptors promising
candidates for ap-induced weight gain. an extensive

presentation of published receptor binding properties is
beyond the scope of this study. however, on the basis of our
review integrating data from different sources, we did not
find significant differences between our binding data and
results derived from other studies. certainly, caution is
warranted in comparing findings across studies that vary
significantly in methodology and it is important to note
that some inconsistencies exist in the receptor-binding data
reported in the literature. nonetheless, the research done
thus far has yielded certain consistent general properties
that are useful to consider at a clinical level.
the differing action of ap on the serotonergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic, g-amino butyric acid (gaba)-ergic,
histaminergic and other neurotransmitter systems has been
hypothesized to be involved in weight gain.1,60–62 in their
clinical investigation of weight changes under the ap
clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone,  xxxd3195xxx  and haloperidol, wirshing et al.3 found, based on the known receptorbinding properties of these drugs, an exponential association between the  xxxg1078xxx  affinity and the
weight gain is observed in the patients. the serotonin 5-ht2
receptor, another plausible candidate for this side effect, was
not associated with weight gain. kroeze et al.59 investigated
the binding properties of 17 typical and atypical ap
(including clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol) towards
12 neurotransmitter receptors and correlated the results
with short-term weight gain data (derived from allison
et al.2). they found that the receptor affinities of histamine
h1, adrenaline a1a, serotonin 5-ht2c and  xxxg1119xxx  receptors,
respectively, were significantly correlated with weight gain,
whereas the eight other receptor’s affinities were not
(adrenaline a2a, a2b and a2c; serotonin 5-ht1a, 5-ht2a and
5-ht7; dopamine d2; muscarinic m3). although there are
some differences with respect to the methods and the
receptors investigated, these findings are widely in line with
our results indicating an association of the histamine h1 and
the serotonin 5-ht2c and  xxxg1119xxx  receptors with ap-induced
short-term weight gain,2 while the muscarinic  xxxg449xxx 
does not seem to play a major role in this side effect.
there are some pharmacological clues, which suggest that
the serotonergic and histaminergic systems may play a role
in clozapine-induced weight gain.13,15,16 studies involving
polymorphisms of the serotonin 5-ht1a, 5-ht2a, 5ht2c,13,63  xxxg1119xxx  genes, 5-ht transporter gene,63
and the histamine h1 and  xxxg1079xxx  genes13 have failed
to demonstrate genotype effects on clozapine-induced
weight gain. the finding of a significant association
between a 759c/t polymorphism of the  xxxg1115xxx 
gene and weight gain induced by diverse ap (mostly
chlorpromazine and risperidone)17 or by clozapine18 could
not be confirmed by three independent studies involving
clozapine.14,19,20 however, sample characteristics and differences in observation period between studies may play a role.
recent studies in acutely ill (olanzapine23) or first episode
(mostly olanzapine and risperidone22) patients and those
followed in longer-term studies (6 months;21 9 months22)
showed that carriers of the 759t allele gained significant
less weight. the 759c/t polymorphism of the 5-ht2c

receptor gene is of interest because the 759c allele is
functionally active.64
in conclusion, the current results suggest that the selected
candidate receptors derived from known pathways involved
in body weight regulation (table 1) do not play a significant
part in the direct pharmacological action of clozapine,
olanzapine and haloperidol. with respect to other candidates from (neuro)transmitter systems already suggested to
be involved in ap-induced weight gain (table 2), our results
confirm binding data from the literature indicating an
involvement of the serotonin 5-ht2a, 5-ht2c and  xxxg1119xxx ,
muscarinic m1 and/or histamine h1 receptors in this side
effect. so far, research into ap-induced weight gain has
primarily focused on neurotransmitter receptors. much less
is known about other receptor systems and ap effects. we
believe that the systematic investigation of the role of
peripherally and centrally acting hormones and peptides
involved in body weight regulation may be a promising
approach to investigate the mechanisms potentially underlying ap-induced weight gain. in this context, the rapidly
evolving knowledge derived from molecular obesity research may benefit the identification of potential candidates
for this side effect. further studies are necessary to understand the implication and the possible cross-talk between
the diverse transmitter systems potentially involved in apinduced weight gain.
