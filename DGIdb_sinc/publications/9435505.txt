273 (cell physiol. 42): c1987–c1994, 1997.—both hyaluronidase and transforming growth factor (tgf)-b1 play a significant role in the development of prostate cancer. in this study,
the regulation of  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-mediated cell
death by hyaluronidase and tgf-b1 was investigated. preexposure of l929 fibroblasts, prostate lncap cells, and epithelial mv 1 lu cells to hyaluronidase for a minimum of 12 h
resulted in significant enhancement of cell death by tnf.
phosphorylation of p42 and  xxxd1355xxx  mitogen-activated protein
(map) kinases was found by stimulation of l929 cells with
hyaluronidase for 30 min, indicating that the raf/map
kinase-extracellular signal-regulating protein kinase (mek)/
map kinase pathway was activated. however, blocking the
activation of upstream map kinase kinase ( xxxg1361xxx  and 2
kinase) by  xxxd1169xxx  failed to inhibit the hyaluronidaseenhanced tnf killing of cells, suggesting that hyaluronidasemediated degradation of extracellular matrix and membrane
components may elicit multiple signaling pathways. as a
potent stimulator of extracellular matrix protein synthesis,
tgf-b1 blocked the hyaluronidase-enhanced death of l929
and lncap cells mediated by tnf. tgf-b1 activated proteintyrosine kinases in l929 cells, in which the  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors  xxxd2449xxx  and tyrphostin blocked the activation as well as the tgf-b1 inhibition of hyaluronidase effects.
functional antagonism was also observed between hyaluronidase and tgf-b1 in cell growth regulation. for example,
tgf-b1-mediated suppression of epithelial mv 1 lu cell
growth was abolished by hyaluronidase. overall, it is demonstrated in this study that hyaluronidase reciprocally antagonized tgf-b1 in the modulation of cell proliferation and
tnf-mediated death.

as a matrix-degrading enzyme,

hyaluronidase participates in cancer progression, invasion, and angiogenesis. various cancer cells, such as wilms’ tumor, produce hyaluronidase (22, 29). elevation of hyaluronidase
levels is associated with prostate cancer progression
(18). expression of hyaluronidase by tumor cells induces angiogenesis in vivo (17). notably, the growth of
murine lung carcinoma and melanoma is influenced by
hyal-1, a locus determining hyaluronidase levels and
polymorphism (11).
as opposed to the function of hyaluronidase, transforming growth factor (tgf)-b is a potent stimulator of
extracellular matrix protein synthesis (25). moreover,
tgf-b increases tumorigenicity in vivo by suppressing
the local immune system (13, 15). overexpression of
tgf-b is frequently associated with the development of
benign prostatic hyperplasia to malignant prostate
cancer (27, 28) and breast cancer progression (1, 33).

in this study, tgf-b1 was found to reciprocally
counteract hyaluronidase function in the regulation of
cell proliferation and  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)mediated cell death. both in vitro and in vivo studies
have shown that destruction of extracellular matrix by
hyaluronidase increases cancer cell susceptibility to
chemotherapeutic drugs (2, 10, 16, 24, 26). as determined in this study, pretreatment of l929 fibrosarcoma
(6, 7), prostate lncap (31) and lung epithelial mv 1 lu
(23) cells with hyaluronidase for at least 12 h, followed
by exposure to tnf, resulted in increased cell death.
tgf-b1 protects l929 cells from tnf killing (6).
interestingly, tgf-b1 inhibited the hyaluronidasemediated enhancement of tnf killing. conversely,
hyaluronidase counteracted tgf-b1-mediated growth
inhibition of epithelial mv 1 lu cells (23). how tgf-b1
counteracted hyaluronidase induction of tnf sensitivity in l929 cells was investigated.
materials and methods

cell lines. tnf-sensitive l929 cells were cultured in 10%
newborn calf serum-rpmi 1640 medium as previously described (6, 7). mink lung epithelial mv 1 lu cells (23) and
human prostate cancer lncap cells (31) were cultured
according to the instructions of the american type culture
collection (rockville, md).
tnf cytotoxicity assays. tnf cytotoxicity assays were
performed as previously described (5–7). briefly, 100-µl aliquots of l929 cells (2.5 3 105 cells/ml) were dispensed onto
96-well microtiter plates (corning, corning, ny), cultured for
24 h, treated with bovine testicular hyaluronidase (0–200
u/ml; sigma) for 12–24 h, and exposed to recombinant  xxxg2296xxx 
(500–4,000 u/ml; genzyme, boston, ma) for 16–24 h. to
determine the extent of death, the cells were fixed and
stained with crystal violet (2% in 50% methanol) and analyzed in an automatic microtiter plate reader for optical
density (od) at 560 nm (slt labinstruments, research
triangle park, nc). compared with each hyaluronidasetreated or untreated cell group, the extent of cell death in the
corresponding tnf-treated cell group (hyaluronidase-treated
or untreated cells) was calculated as follows: %cell death 5
[(od from control cells 2 od from tnf-treated cells) 4 od
from control cells] 3 100. the extent of hyaluronidasemediated enhancement of tnf cytotoxicity was also calculated: %enhancement 5 [(%tnf killing of hyaluronidasestimulated cells 4 %tnf killing of control cells) 2 1] 3 100
(5–7). unless otherwise indicated, data are presented as
means 6 sd (n 5 8). as indicated, the extent of cell death was
also confirmed by using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium
(mts tetrazolium) proliferation assay kit (promega, madison, wi). conversion of the mts tetrazolium into a soluble
formazan by viable cells was measured as 490-nm od (4).
similar experiments were performed using mv 1 lu and
lncap cells.

hyaluronidase induction of tnf apoptosis

the extent of tnf-mediated apoptotic cell death was also
confirmed by determination of internucleosomal dna fragmentation, as measured in agarose gel electrophoresis described previously (5).
chemicals used to modulate the hyaluronidase-mediated
enhancement of tnf killing were the mitogen-activating
protein (map) kinase-extracellular signal-regulating protein
kinase (mek) 1 and 2 kinase inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx  (21), the
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors tyrphostin (12) and  xxxd2449xxx 
(20), and the protein kinase c (pkc) inhibitor h-7 (14). these
chemicals were utilized in cotreatment of l929 cells with
hyaluronidase for indicated durations, and the cells were
then exposed to tnf.
functional antagonism of tgf-b1. tgf-b1 regulation of
hyaluronidase-mediated enhancement of l929 cell death by
tnf was examined. l929 cells were pretreated with hyaluronidase in the presence or absence of purified human
platelet tgf-b1 (0.25–2 ng/ml; collaborative research, bedford, ma) for 16–24 h, followed by removal of the culture
supernatants and exposure to tnf for 16–24 h. similarly, the
hyaluronidase-pretreated l929 cells (16–24 h) were exposed
to tgf-b1 for 1–7 h, followed by removal of culture supernatants and incubation with tnf for 16–24 h, or the hyaluronidase-pretreated cells were exposed simultaneously to tgf-b1
and/or tnf for 16–24 h. also, tgf-b1 (0.25–2 ng/ml; in 50 µl
of rpmi 1640 medium containing 2% albumin) was precoated
onto 96-well microtiter plates for 9 h in a humidified 37°c
incubator (nondry coating with lids on), after which the plates
were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and
l929 cells were seeded. these cells were cultured overnight,
treated with hyaluronidase for 24 h, and subsequently exposed to tnf for 16–24 h.
additional cytokines used in the testings were recombinant
tgf-b2 (oncogene science, uniondale, ny), tgf-b3 (oncogene science), interferon-g (genzyme), interleukin (il)-4
(peprotech, rocky hill, nj), il-6 (a reference standard from
the national cancer institute, bethesda, md), il-10 (peprotech), and il-13 (peprotech).

western blotting. to examine whether hyaluronidase activated the raf/mek/map kinase pathway, l929 cells in petri
dishes were treated with hyaluronidase (100 u/ml) for 0, 0.5,
1, 2, or 4 h, followed by washing with cold pbs and lysis of the
cells with a lysis buffer (6). western blotting was performed
as described (8). briefly, 10 µg of the cell lysates were
subjected to reducing  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis, electroblotting of the separated proteins
onto a zeta-probe nylon membrane (bio-rad laboratories,
hercules, ca), and probing with specific polyclonal immunoglobulin g antibodies against a synthetic phosphopeptide of
p42 and  xxxd1355xxx  map kinases (new england biolab, beverly,
ma).
hyaluronidase blocking of tgf-b1-mediated growth inhibition. tgf-b1 is known to restrict the proliferation of mv 1 lu
cells (23). to examine the functional antagonism between
tgf-b1 and hyaluronidase, mv 1 lu cells were treated with
tgf-b1 in the presence or absence of hyaluronidase for 24
and 48 h. the extent of cell proliferation was examined by
both crystal violet staining and the mts assay.

apoptosis (fig. 1). these results were observed by
staining the cells with crystal violet, and comparable
results were obtained using the mts proliferation
assay (data not shown). the enhanced cell death also
occurred when the hyaluronidase-pretreated l929 cells
were exposed to tnf with the continuous presence of
hyaluronidase. hyaluronidase increased l929 cell
growth by ,5–10% in 16 h (fig. 1). time course studies
demonstrated that development of the enhanced tnf

hyaluronidase induction of tnf apoptosis

killing required pretreatment of l929 cells with hyaluronidase for a minimum of 12 h (data not shown).
tnf-mediated apoptotic cell death was verified by
analysis of internucleosomal dna fragmentation. compared with control cells, the hyaluronidase-pretreated
cells, when challenged with tnf for 6 h, had increased
dna fragmentation (fig. 1). a higher concentration of
tnf (4,000 u/ml) was used in this short-term assay.
when prostate lncap cells were pretreated with
hyaluronidase for 24 h and subsequently exposed to
tnf, tnf killing of the cells was increased by ,540–
1,200% (or 5.4- to 12-fold; fig. 2). however, without
pretreatment, cotreatment of lncap cells with hyaluronidase and tnf failed to increase the tnf killing
(data not shown). normal lung epithelial mv 1 lu cells
were also responsive to hyaluronidase induction of tnf
sensitivity (during pretreatment) by approximately
onefold increase.
hyaluronidase also enhanced serum deprivationmediated growth inhibition. shown in the fig. 3 is the
increased growth inhibition caused by pretreatment of
l929 cells with hyaluronidase for 24 h, followed by
culturing under serum-free conditions for 24 h.
hyaluronidase activation of the raf/mek/map kinase pathway in l929 cells. hyaluronidase-mediated

exposure of l929 cells to hyaluronidase for 30 min
resulted in activation of p42 and  xxxd1355xxx  map kinases of
the raf/mek/map kinase pathway, as observed in the
western blotting using the specific antibodies against a
synthetic tyrosine-phosphopeptide of p42 and  xxxd1355xxx  map
kinases (fig. 4a). nonetheless, blocking the activation
of  xxxg1361xxx  and 2 kinases (upstream activators of p42
and  xxxd1355xxx  map kinases) by the specific inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx  failed to abolish the hyaluronidase enhancement
of tnf killing. indeed,  xxxd1169xxx  alone inhibited tnf

killing of l929 cells, whereas hyaluronidase reversed
this inhibitory effect and restored the sensitivity of
l929 cells to tnf (fig. 4b). during the 48-h culture
period,  xxxd1169xxx  significantly inhibited l929 cell
growth, whereas hyaluronidase reversed the growth
inhibitory effect of  xxxd1169xxx  (fig. 4c).
tgf-b1 inhibition of hyaluronidase enhancement of
tnf killing. tgf-b1 was found to inhibit hyaluronidase-mediated enhancement of tnf killing. when
l929 cells were pretreated with hyaluronidase for 22 h,
followed by exposure to tgf-b1 for 1.5 h and subsequent treatment with tnf for 16–24 h, the hyaluronidase-enhanced tnf killing was blocked by tgf-b1
(fig. 5a). similar results were obtained by exposure of
the hyaluronidase-pretreated l929 cells to tgf-b1 for
2–7 h (data not shown). exposure of the hyaluronidasepretreated l929 cells to both tnf and tgf-b1 for
16–24 h also resulted in abrogation of the effects of
hyaluronidase. growth of l929 cells overnight in 96well plates that had been precoated with tgf-b1,
followed by treatment with hyaluronidase for 24 h, also
resulted in blocking of the hyaluronidase enhancement
of tnf killing by tgf-b1 (fig. 5b). tgf-b1 also
inhibited tnf-mediated nuclear dna fragmentation
in both control and hyaluronidase-pretreated cells (fig.
5c).
blocking of the hyaluronidase effects by tgf-b1 was
also observed in lncap cells (fig. 6). lncap cells were
pretreated with hyaluronidase for 24 h, followed by
coincubation with tgf-b1 for 2 h, then removal of
hyaluronidase and tgf-b1, and exposure to tnf for
24 h.
under similar experimental conditions, cytokines,
including interferon-g (0.1–100 ng/ml), il-4 (1–1,000
pg/ml), il-6 (10–10,000 u/ml), il-10 (0.1–100 ng/ml),
and il-13 (1–1,000 pg/ml), were not capable of blocking
the hyaluronidase effects (data not shown). both tgf-b2
and tgf-b3 were ,50% less effective than tgf-b1 in
blocking the hyaluronidase effects.

alone blocked tnf killing of l929 cells, which was
reversed by hyaluronidase. c: during 48-h treatment,
 xxxd1169xxx  suppressed l929 cell growth and growth
inhibition was reversed by hyaluronidase.

blocking of tgf-b1 effects by protein- xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors. previously, i have shown that proteintyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as  xxxd2449xxx  and
tyrphostin, inhibit tgf-b1 function in protecting l929
cells against tnf-mediated cell death and that tgf-b1
stimulates protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in l929
cells (6). in this study, both  xxxd2449xxx  and tyrphostin blocked the counteractive effect of tgf-b1 against
hyaluronidase. when l929 cells were pretreated with
hyaluronidase for 16–24 h and subsequently exposed to
tgf-b1 in the presence of  xxxd2449xxx  or tyrphostin
for 7 h, the tgf-b1 inhibition of the hyaluronidaseincreased tnf killing was abolished (fig. 7). in contrast, h-7, a pkc inhibitor, was less effective in blocking the tgf-b1 effect (fig. 7). both  xxxd2449xxx  and
tyrphostin could not abolish the effect of hyaluronidase
in increasing tnf sensitivity in l929 cells (data not
shown).
hyaluronidase reversal of tgf-b1-mediated suppression of mv 1 lu cell growth. finally, the functional
antagonism between hyaluronidase and tgf-b1 was
observed in the regulation of cell growth. in agreement
with other observations (23), treatment of mv 1 lu cells
with tgf-b1 resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation
(fig. 8a). this growth inhibitory effect of tgf-b1 was
reversed by hyaluronidase (fig. 8a). tgf-b1 inhibited
mv 1 lu cell growth but failed to induce apoptosis in
these cells, as determined by nuclear dna fragmentation analysis (fig. 8b).
discussion

in this study, functional antagonism between hyaluronidase and tgf-b1 was observed in the modulation
of cell proliferation and tnf-mediated cell death. as an
extracellular matrix degrading enzyme, hyaluronidase
increased tnf-mediated killing of l929 fibroblasts,

prostate lncap cells, and epithelial mv 1 lu cells. in
contrast, as a potent stimulator of extracellular matrix
protein synthesis, tgf-b1 blocked the hyaluronidasemediated enhancement of tnf killing in these cells.
conceivably, one of the mechanisms by which tgf-b1
blocked the hyaluronidase effects is tgf-b1 restoration
of the damaged extracellular matrix by hyaluronidase.
the physical integrity of extracellular matrix is
important in protecting cancer cells from attack by
anticancer drugs and the immune system. thus treatment of cancer cells with hyaluronidase, either in vivo
or in vitro, increases their susceptibility to anticancer
drugs (2, 10, 16, 24, 26). however, these observations
are in contrast to my previous report that, when l929
cells were pretreated with hyaluronidase for 12–24 h,
the cells resisted killing by tnf and anti-fas antibodies in the presence of anticancer drugs such as  xxxd1800xxx , doxorubicin,  xxxd1816xxx , and cycloheximide
(7). in this study, however, pretreatment of l929 and
lncap cells with hyaluronidase for 12–24 h resulted
in increased tnf sensitivity without the presence of
these anticancer drugs. these observations indicate
that hyaluronidase-mediated de novo protein synthesis
is essential for conferring tnf susceptibility in these
cells. indeed, by metabolic labeling we have demonstrated seven protein species induced by hyaluronidase
in l929 cells (n.-s. chang, n. joki, j. mattison, e. chu,
and m. ou, unpublished observations). conceivably,
one of these proteins is capable of enhancing tnf
killing in l929 cells.
additionally, a likely scenario that accounts for the
increased tnf sensitivity in l929 and lncap cells is
due to the release of growth factors from the extracellular matrix on digestion with hyaluronidase. the extracellular matrix is an excellent reservoir for growth
factors such as fibroblast growth factor. presumably, these

control and hyaluronidase-treated l929 cells.
a: l929 cells were pretreated with hyaluronidase for 22 h, then exposed to tgf-b1 (2
ng/ml) for 1.5 h, and subsequently treated
with  xxxg2296xxx  (1,000 u/ml) for 16–24 h. b:
96-well plates were precoated with tgf-b1
(0–2 ng/ml) at 37°c for 9 h (nondry coating
with lid on), followed by 2 washes with phosphate-buffered saline and seeding of l929
cells overnight. these cells were treated with
hyaluronidase (100 u/ml) for 24 h, washed
once with medium, and exposed to  xxxg2296xxx 
(1,000 u/ml) for 24 h. c: under similar conditions, l929 cells were pretreated with hyaluronidase for 22 h, then exposed to tgf-b1 (2
ng/ml) for 1.5 h, and subsequently treated
with  xxxg2296xxx  (4,000 u/ml) for 6 h. nuclear dna
was isolated and electrophoresed in a 2%
agarose gel. dna molecular size standard is

growth factors enhance l929 cell proliferation and increase their tnf susceptibility, since in most cases tnf
targets proliferating cells. thus the role of growth factors
from the extracellular matrix in conferring tnf susceptibility in certain cancer cells remains to be established.
although degradation of extracellular matrix  xxxd2289xxx  and  xxxd1687xxx  occurred in hyaluronidase-treated cells, exogenous glycosaminoglycans, including  xxxd2289xxx ,  xxxd1687xxx ,
dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate and heparin, failed
to block the hyaluronidase effects (data not shown).
notably, as a stabilizer of extracellular matrix, the
 xxxd2289xxx -binding protein inter-a-inhibitor (9)
blocks hyaluronidase induction of tnf sensitivity in
l929 cells (chang et al., unpublished observations).
this observation indicates that extracellular matrix
proteins participate in conferring tnf resistance in
l929 and probably other cells.
previously, i have shown that hyaluronidase fails to
alter the expression of tnf receptors and the receptor

binding affinity for tnf in l929 cells (7). furthermore,
hyaluronidase-pretreated l929 cells, with subsequent
exposure to tnf and/or  xxxd1800xxx , exhibit no
significant changes in the expression of apoptosis regulatory proteins (7), such as bcl-2 (19),  xxxg251xxx  (3), ich-1
(32) and the rna-binding protein tiar (30). thus
these proteins are not involved in the hyaluronidasemediated enhancement of tnf killing in l929 cells.
not all the cancer cells can be induced by hyaluronidase to increase their tnf susceptibility. for example,
tnf-resistant prostate du 145, ovarian me-180, and
monkey kidney cos-7 cells were refractory to hyaluroni-

dase induction of tnf sensitivity. the underlying
mechanism is unknown. however, the differences in
the responsiveness of prostate lncap and du 145 cells
to hyaluronidase induction of tnf sensitivity suggest
that cellular genetic variations and mutations, culture
conditions, and cell origins contribute to their differential responsiveness to tnf and/or hyaluronidase.
the raf/mek/map kinase pathway was activated
when l929 cells were treated with hyaluronidase for 30
min, as evidenced by the phosphorylation of p42 and
 xxxd1355xxx  map kinases. however, inhibition of the upstream
 xxxg1361xxx  and 2 kinase activation by  xxxd1169xxx  failed to
abolish the hyaluronidase effects. these observations
suggest that multiple signaling pathways may be transduced into cells by digestion of the cells and surrounding extracellular matrix with hyaluronidase.
most interestingly,  xxxd1169xxx  inhibited l929 cell
proliferation and rendered these cells tnf resistant.
these inhibitory effects were reversed by hyaluronidase. thus this observation further supports the notion
that additional signaling pathways are elicited by hyaluronidase. in addition to  xxxd1169xxx , i have examined a
variety of protein tyrosine and  xxxg1377xxx 
inhibitors in blocking the hyaluronidase effects. these
inhibitors included  xxxd2449xxx , tyrphostin,  xxxd2271xxx 
a, h-7, and g-490 (a selective inhibitor of  xxxg1220xxx  kinase).
nonetheless, these inhibitors were not able to block the
hyaluronidase effects. thus hyaluronidase-elicited signaling transduction remains to be established.
hyaluronidase partially enhanced serum growth factor-mediated proliferation of l929 cells, whereas on
withdrawal of serum the hyaluronidase-pretreated l929
cells had an increased retardation of growth. the
continuous presence of serum supports the cells to
enter rounds of cell cycles, and hyaluronidase enhances
the cell cycle progression, probably by inducing de novo
protein synthesis. on withdrawal of serum growth
factors, the hyaluronidase-pretreated l929 cells probably enter growth arrest in the g1 phase faster than

hyaluronidase induction of tnf apoptosis

untreated starved cells. these hyaluronidase-pretreated l929 cells will undergo apoptosis as long as the
serum growth factors are continuously absent. although it is not yet tested, it is reasonable to postulate
that activation of caspase proteins, the cell death
proteases, is enhanced in hyaluronidase-pretreated
l929 cells, compared with control cells.
how hyaluronidase supports prostate cancer progression is unknown. on the basis of our data from l929
and other cells, hyaluronidase stimulates cancer cell
growth, and these proliferating cells are the targets for
anticancer drugs, such as  xxxd1800xxx , doxorubicin,
and  xxxd1816xxx , and for tnf. however, development
of drug resistance in cancer cells is not only dependent
on the expression of the multiple drug resistance gene
but is also related to hyaluronidase secretion. although
cotreatment of cancer cells with hyaluronidase and
anticancer drugs increases the drug-mediated killing
(2, 10, 16, 24, 26), my unpublished observations showed
that, when l929 and lncap cells were pretreated with
hyaluronidase for 24 h, these cells became resistant to
killing by  xxxd1800xxx , doxorubicin, and  xxxd1816xxx . thus hyaluronidase-secreting cancer cells may
indeed resist killing by anticancer drugs, thus allowing
their progression.
tgf-b1 restoration of the hyaluronidase-destroyed
extracellular matrix may contribute in part to the
inhibition of hyaluronidase effects. as a potent builder
of extracellular matrix, tgf-b1 abrogated the hyaluronidase enhancement of tnf killing of l929 and
lncap cells. previously, i reported that tgf-b1 rapidly increases protein tyrosine phosphorylation in l929
cells, and that these cellular tyrosine phosphorylated
proteins interrupt the tnf killing pathway (6). accordingly, treatment of l929 cells with tgf-b1 in the
presence of  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors such as  xxxd2449xxx  and tyrphostin abolished the tgf-b1 antagonism
of hyaluronidase.
functional antagonism also demonstrated that hyaluronidase blocked tgf-b1-mediated growth inhibition
of mv 1 lu cells. similar results were also observed in
cos-7 and me-180 cells (data not shown). although the
underlying mechanism remains to be established, my
observations raise an intriguing question regarding
how overproduction of both hyaluronidase and tgf-b
contributes to the progression and metastasis of prostate cancer. conceivably, a balanced production of
hyaluronidase and tgf-b1 by prostate cancer is important for their development.
overall, in this study, the in vitro functional antagonism between hyaluronidase and tgf-b1 is demonstrated. whether hyaluronidase and tgf-b1 act synergistically or antagonistically in vivo remains to be
established.
