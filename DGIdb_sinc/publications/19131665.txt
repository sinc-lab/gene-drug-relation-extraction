direct subunit-dependent multimodal 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor antagonism by methadone.  homomeric 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)(3a) and heteromeric 5-ht(3ab) receptors mediate rapid excitatory responses to serotonin in the central and peripheral nervous systems. the alkaloid morphine, in addition to being a mu-opioid receptor agonist, is a potent competitive inhibitor of 5-ht(3) receptors. we examined whether methadone, an opioid often used to treat morphine dependence, also exhibited 5-ht(3) receptor antagonist properties. racemic (r/s)-methadone inhibited currents mediated by human homomeric 5-ht(3a) receptors (ic(50) = 14.1 +/- 2.5 microm). incorporation of the 5-ht(3b) subunit into heteromeric 5-ht(3ab) receptors reduced the potency of inhibition by (r/s)-methadone (ic(50) = 41.1 +/- 0.9 microm). (r/s)-methadone also increased apparent desensitization of both 5-ht(3) receptor subtypes. the inhibition of the 5-ht(3a) receptor was competitive; however, incorporation of the 5-ht(3b) subunit caused the appearance of inhibition that was insurmountable by 5-ht. in the absence of rapid desensitization, when dopamine was used as an agonist of 5-ht(3ab) receptors, the inhibition by (r/s)-methadone was voltage-dependent. the antagonist and desensitization-enhancing effects of (r/s)-methadone were shared by pure (r)- and (s)-methadone enantiomers, which had similar actions on 5-ht-evoked currents mediated by 5-ht(3) receptors. however, (r)-methadone exhibited a larger voltage-dependent inhibition of dopamine-evoked currents mediated by 5-ht(3ab) receptors than did (s)-methadone. inhibition of 5-ht(3a) receptors by (r/s)-methadone was not influenced by voltage. thus, methadone displays multimodal subunit-dependent antagonism of 5-ht(3) receptors.
