gm-csf ( xxxg526xxx ) is a glycoprotein which stimulates the pro­
liferation. differentiation, and functional activation of granulo­
cytes and macrophages (gough and nicola. 1990). the biologi­
cal activities of gm-csf are transduced via specific cell-surface
receptors displaying both high and low binding affinity and
comprising at least two distinct chains (nicola. 1991). we
recently cloned a cdna specifying the primary chain, the a
chain of the human gm-csf receptor ( xxxg527xxx ) (gearing et
al.. 1989). a polypeptide of 378 residues with low binding affin­
ity and a glycosylated molecular weight of about 85 kdal. the
arrangement of four of the 11 cysteine residues in the extracellu­
lar domain, as well as several other stretches of conserved
sequence, notably the motif trp-ser-x-trp-ser, identify the
 xxxg527xxx  chain as a member of the newly defined class of haemopoietin receptors (gearing et al.. 1989). more recently, a sec­
ond subunit of the human gm-csf receptor (the p chain) was
cloned by homology with a murine  xxxg1177xxx  receptor clone (hayashida et al., 1990). the gm-csf-r p chain ( xxxg528xxx ) cdna
encodes a protein of 120 kdal which does not of itself bind  xxxg526xxx  (hayashida et al., 1990). however, co-transfection of
cdnas for the gm-csf receptopr a and p chains results in for­
mation of a high affinity receptor for gm-csf. the p chain is a
member of the same newly defined receptor family as the a
chain (hayashida et al., 1990).
the gene for the gm-csf receptor a chain ( xxxg527xxx ) was
localized to the pseudoautosomal region, a region of ~ 2.6 mbp
of homologous sequence localized at the tip of the human sex
chromosomes (gough et al., 1990). more recently, we have
mapped the a chain gene between 1.1 0 0 -1.300 kb from the tel­
omere. adjacent to cpg island b5 (rappold et al., personal
communication). in this paper we have determined the chromo­
somal location of the gene specifying the gm-csf-r p chain
( xxxg528xxx ).

translocations involving chromosome 22 and the chromosome
expessing the rare fragile site fra22a place the gene in the
region 2 2 q l2 .2 -» q l3 .1, proximal to the fragile site.

materials and methods
to determ ine the human chromosome to which  xxxg528xxx  maps we
screened a panel o f human x mouse somatic cell hybrids. this was performed
using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with pcr primers specific for the
hum an  xxxg528xxx  gene. to identify human-speeifie gm-csf receptor p chain
primers. pcr was performed on 11 samples each of hum an and murine
genomic dna (0.6-0.7 jig) using sets of oligonucleotide prim er pairs covering
the entire coding region of the human  xxxg528xxx  mrna. a pair of primers that
amplified a ~ 1.1 -kb  xxxg528xxx  product from hum an genomic dna samples,
but not from m urine dna, was identified. these primers correspond
to positions 581-600 (5'gcagccatcctcctctccaa.v) and 941-960
(5'gg cacgg gaa tctgg ctg cg3') of the published human  xxxg528xxx 
cdna sequence. confirm ation that the amplified fragment in fact corre­
sponded to the  xxxg528xxx  gene was obtained by hybridisation to a specific
internal oligonucleotide. these primers were thus employed to map the
 xxxg528xxx  gene.
the pcr reaction mix and conditions for mapping  xxxg528xxx  in somatic
cell hybrids were as described by richards et al. (1991). the pcr was carried
out using genomic dna from a series of som atic cell hybrid lines (callen et
al., 1990b). each containing a different com bination of human chromosomes;
all hum an chromosomes, except the y chromosome, were represented in al
least one hybrid cell line.
to independently confirm and to determ ine more precisely the localiza­
tion o f the  xxxg528xxx  gene on chromosome 22. in situ hybridization was used.
a 1.4-kb  xxxg528xxx  cdna corresponding to nucleotides 440-1.815 (isolated
from a human monocyte cdna library), plus its vector, was nick translated
with biotin 14- xxxd1148xxx  and hybridized in situ at a probe concentration o f 5 ng/
pi to metaphases from two normal males and from individuals with the rear­
rangements shown in table i. the fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish)
method was m odified from that previously described (callen et al.. 1990a). in
that chromosomes were stained before analysis with both  xxxd3027xxx  iodide
(as counterstain) and dapi (for chromosome identification).

pcr. the 1.1 -kb fragment diagnostic of the human  xxxg528xxx 
chain gene was generated in total human dna and in dna
from five cell lines (cy9, c y 13. c y 130. cy 155. and c y 175)
which contain human chromosome 22 but not from cell lines
lacking chromosome 22, thus localizing the  xxxg528xxx  gene to
chromosome 22 (fig. 1).
fish. twenty normal male metaphases were examined for
fluorescent signal. eighty percent of these metaphases showed
signal on one or both chromatids of chromosome 22 in the
region 22ql 1.2—>q 13.2: 52% of this signal was in the proximal
portion of band 2 2 q l3 .1 (fig. 2). there were 18 non-specific
background dots observed in these 20 metaphases. a similar

result was obtained from the hybridization to the second normal
male (data not shown).
once it was confirmed that the  xxxg528xxx  gene was on 22q. the
probe was hybridized to chromosomes containing rearrange­
ments of this region as shown in table i. in 38 metaphases from
the t(9:22)(q34.1;q 11.2) (philadelphia translocation) blood
sample, fluorescent signal was observed on the normal chromo­
some 22 in 17 cells, on the end of the long arm of the der(9) in 17
cells, and on both the normal 22 and the der(9) in four cells. no
signal was seen on the der(22). thus  xxxg528xxx  clearly maps dis­
tal to the breakpoint in q 11.2 of the philadelphia translocation.
similarly for the t( 16;22) (p 13.3;q 12.2), in a total of 12 meta­
phases there was fluorescent signal observed on the normal
chromosome 22 in three cells, on the end of the short arm of the
der( 16) in five cells, and on both the normal 22 and the der(16)
in four cells. thus,  xxxg528xxx  is distal to the breakpoint at
22q 12.2. in 18 metaphases in which chromosome 22 was
expressing the fragile site at 22q 13.1 (fra22a), fluorescent sig­
nal was observed to lie proximal to the fragile site in 14 cells,
centrally placed over the gap in four cells, and distal to the frag­
ile site in one cell. hence,  xxxg528xxx  maps clearly proximal, but
close, to the fragile site. these data refine the localization of the
 xxxg528xxx  gene to the interval 22q 12.2—>q 13.1, but most proba­
bly to the proximal part ofband q 13.1.

discussion
there is considerable interest in the region of human chro­
mosome 22 to which  xxxg528xxx  maps. nf2, an apparent reces­
sive tumour suppressor gene, has been mapped to the interval
22q 11.1 —>q 13.1 and considerable effort has been applied to

localization of  xxxg528xxx 

generating linked markers in this region (dumanski et al., 1991;
fiedler et al., 1991). the chromosome 22 breakpoint of the
t( 11 ;22) which is frequently associated with ewing sarcoma and
peripheral neuroepithelioma has been localized to band ql2.1,
as has the lif gene, which is located at least 650 kb distal to this
translocation breakpoint (sutherland et al., 1989; selleri et al.,
1991). the  xxxg528xxx  gene will thus provide a further marker

within this region. finally, a t( 1;22) (p 13;q 13) frequently associ­
ated with acute myeloid leukaemia of the m7 subtype (acute
megakaryoblastic leukaemia), involves the same cytogenetic
region as the  xxxg528xxx  gene (carroll et al., 1991) and it will be of
interest to ascertain if the  xxxg528xxx  gene is in fact closely associ­
ated with and affected by this translocation.
