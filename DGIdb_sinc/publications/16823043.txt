abstract
methionine aminopeptidases (metaps) remove the initiator methionine during protein biosynthesis.
they exist in two isoforms,  xxxg1399xxx  and  xxxg1400xxx . the anti-angiogenic compound  xxxd2166xxx  binds
tightly to the type 2 metaps but only weakly to type 1. high-affinity complexes of  xxxd2166xxx  and its
relative  xxxd2800xxx  with type 2 human metap have been reported. here we describe the crystallographic
structure of the low-affinity complex between  xxxd2800xxx  and type 1 human metap at 1.1 å resolution.
this provides the first opportunity to compare the structures of  xxxd2800xxx  or  xxxd2166xxx  bound to a type 1
and a type 2 metap. for both type 1 and type 2 human metaps the inhibitor makes a covalent adduct
with a corresponding histidine. at the same time there are significant differences in the alignment of the
inhibitors within the respective active sites. it has been argued that the lower affinity of  xxxd2800xxx  and
 xxxd2166xxx  for the type 1 metaps is due to the smaller size of their active sites relative to the type 2
enzymes. comparison with the uncomplexed structure of human type 1 metap indicates that there is
some truth to this. several active site residues have to move ‘‘outward’’ by 0.5 å or so to accommodate
the inhibitor. other residues move ‘‘inward.’’ there are, however, other factors that come into play. in
particular, the side chain of his310 rotates by 134° into a different position where (together with glu128
and tyr195) it coordinates a metal ion not seen at this site in the native enzyme.

angiogenesis, the growth of new capillary blood vessels,
is important not only in physiological processes but also
for tumor progression and metastasis. in 1971, folkman
(folkman 1971) proposed that the inhibition of angiogenesis is potentially a promising approach for the
treatment of cancer. the natural products  xxxd2166xxx  and
 xxxd2800xxx , and their synthetic analog  xxxd1330xxx  (fig. 1)
were shown to have potent anti-angiogenic activity (ingber
et al. 1990; kusaka et al. 1994; yamamoto et al. 1994). tnpreprint requests to: brian matthews, institute of molecular biology,

470 was effective against tumor growth and metastasis in a
wide range of in vivo tumor models (yamaoka et al. 1993a, b;
bergers et al. 1999). human type 2 methionine aminopeptidase (hsmetap2) was identified as the molecular target
of these fungal secretes (griffith et al. 1997; sin et al.
1997), and biochemical and structural studies showed that
these compounds alkylate an active site histidine (liu et al.
1998; lowther et al. 1998).
there are >60 anti-angiogenesis inhibitors in clinical
trials, of which  xxxd1330xxx  (fig. 1) is most promising
(ingber et al. 1990).  xxxd1330xxx  has cleared up to 100%
of the human tumors in mice. in humans, however, several
patients experienced neurotoxicity at doses where antitumor activity was seen (bhargava et al. 1999; stadler
et al. 1999; logothetis et al. 2001; herbst et al. 2002).

binding of  xxxd2800xxx  to methionine aminopeptidase

figure 1. structures of the natural products  xxxd2166xxx  and  xxxd2800xxx  and the synthetic derivative  xxxd1330xxx .

this led to the belief that the spiroepoxide, which is
sensitive to hydrolysis, could be a target of epoxide hydrolases. fumagalone, a synthetic analog of  xxxd2800xxx  in which
the active epoxide has been replaced by an aldehyde, has
been shown to be a promising alternative (zhou et al. 2003).
several studies have indicated that it is the type 2 and
not the type 1 methionine aminopeptidase ( xxxg1399xxx )
that is the target of  xxxd2800xxx ,  xxxd2166xxx , and  xxxd1330xxx 
(griffith et al. 1997; sin et al. 1997). based on the
structures of the complexes with human  xxxg1400xxx  and the
structure of uncomplexed escherichia coli type 1 metap,
it was proposed that the difference in specificity was due
to a more sterically restricted active site in type 1 metap
(liu et al. 1998). this conclusion was also generally
supported by the recent determination of the structure
of type 1 human metap (hsmetap1) (addlagatta et al.
2005). it has, however, been shown that  xxxd2800xxx  at high
concentrations (>2 mm) can inhibit e. coli metap
(ecmetap), a type 1 enzyme in vitro. this showed that
the active site is accessible to these inhibitors but with
lower affinity (lowther et al. 1998). biochemical and
spectroscopic studies (lowther et al. 1998; cosper et al.
2001; d’souza et al. 2005) have shed some light on the
mode of binding of  xxxd2800xxx  to e. coli metap. at the same
time the lack of a structure of the complex with type 1
enzyme has limited the understanding of the difference in
affinity between the type 1 and the type 2 enzymes.
in this report we show that  xxxd2800xxx  will bind to type 1
(d1–89) human metap and describe the crystal structure
of the complex at 1.1 å resolution. this provides the
first direct visualization of the mode of binding of one
of these angiogenic compounds to a type 1 metap and
how it differs from the type 2 complex.
results
 xxxd2800xxx  binding
the structure of human type 1 metap (truncated at
residue 89) has been described (addlagatta et al. 2005).
we therefore focus on aspects related to the binding of
 xxxd2800xxx . for simplicity, we refer, respectively, to the free

and the bound forms of the enzyme as thsmetap1 and
thsmetap1-ov. liu et al. (1998) described the complex
of type 2 human metap with  xxxd2166xxx  and also
deposited the coordinates of the  xxxd2800xxx  complex in the
protein data bank (pdb; code 1b59). we refer to the
latter complex as hsmetap2-ov.
his212 in thsmetap1-ov is covalently modified by the
spiroepoxy group of  xxxd2800xxx  (fig. 2a). his212 is homologous with his231 of hsmetap2 and with his79 of
ecmetap, which undergo similar reaction. the liberated
hydroxyl group from the epoxide forms a short hydrogen
bond with the bridging water/m-hydroxo anion (2.66 å)
(fig. 2b). the hydroxyl group on the inhibitor does not
interact directly with either of the active site metal ions
(closest distance 3.5 å), consistent with epr and exafs
studies of mn+2-loaded ecmetap (d’souza et al. 2005).
the inhibitor is surrounded by protein side chains and
makes only a single backbone contact (a hydrogen bond
to amide n–h of cys301) (fig. 2a). the anisotropic
thermal factor analysis of the  xxxd2800xxx  (table 1; fig. 2c)
suggests that the isoprenyl group has more freedom than
the rest of the inhibitor. the bound  xxxd2800xxx  displaces two
water molecules. three oxygen atoms of the  xxxd2800xxx , the
c2 hydroxyl, the c3 methoxy, and the intact epoxy group
are solvent-exposed. two partially ordered waters have
been modeled into diffuse density that is within hydrogen-bonding distance to these oxygen atoms.
new metal center
comparison of the free and bound structures of thsmetap1 (fig. 2d) shows that the conformational changes are
generally modest (in contrast to the larger changes that
were anticipated) (liu et al. 1998; addlagatta et al.
2005). his310, however, undergoes a major shift, moving
away from its position in the native enzyme to accommodate the incoming  xxxd2800xxx . in the native structure, ne2
of his310 is hydrogen-bonded to tyr195 (3.0 å), which
in turn forms a short hydrogen bond with glu128 (2.6 å).
in its new position, ne2 interacts with a new metal ion
(2.2 å), not seen in the native structure. this ion also
interacts with tyr195 (2.0 å) and glu128 (2.4 å). the

amplitudes. the calculated amplitudes fc and phases were obtained from the refined model with  xxxd2800xxx  removed. the map is calculated at 1.1 å
resolution and contoured at 4.2 s. the spiroepoxy group of  xxxd2800xxx  covalently modifies his212. the isoprenyl group is buried deep in the active site and
surrounded by several hydrophobic residues. in the ribbon diagram, the catalytic domain of the protein is depicted in gray; the n-terminal region, in red. (b)

superimposed active site residues of thsmetap1 in the native (gray) and  xxxd2800xxx -bound forms (red).  xxxd2800xxx  is represented with thicker bonds. his310
rotates away from the active site providing space for the inhibitor. similarly, several other residues surrounding the  xxxd2800xxx  in thsmetap1-ov undergo
outward movement. cys301, phe309, and met338 move inward.

other side of the metal ion is solvent-exposed with diffuse
electron density, which was refined as two partially
occupied water molecules and a glycerol. the new metal
site was confirmed in a bijvoet difference fourier map
(not shown) and appeared to be a cobalt ion.
the hydrophobic seqsquiterpenyl side chain of  xxxd2800xxx 
is surrounded by several residues, many of which are
hydrophobic (pro192, tyr195, phe198, cys203, his301,
and trp353) (fig. 2d). the side chains of some of these
residues experience slight ‘‘outward’’ movement on inhibitor binding, the largest being tyr195 (0.65 å) (table
2). trp353 moves 0.45 å, this being transmitted to the
surface of the protein, particularly in the neighborhood
of glu128 in the connector region that interacts with the
new metal ion. there are main-chain shifts in the connector region as large as 2.0 å.
in making the covalent adduct with  xxxd2800xxx , his212
moves by 0.5 å into the active site. phe309 also tilts by
1844

;0.5 å toward the isoprenyl group. the side chain
of cys301 adopts two alternate conformations in an
estimated 0.6:0.4 ratio with the major conformer closer
to the  xxxd2800xxx  (fig. 2d). in the native enzyme, the thiol
group points away from the active site (fig. 2a,d).
another residue that undergoes inward movement is
met338, whose ce rotates by 60°, increasing the hydrophobic interaction with c5 and c6 of the inhibitor.
changes in the active site metal binding residues
asp229, a bidentate ligand of co2 in the native enzyme,
exhibits a second ‘‘perpendicular’’ conformation with estimated occupancy of 25% (fig. 3). in this conformation the
carboxylate group contributes only a single oxygen to the
coordination sphere of co2. as a result, the geometry around
co2 has changed from distorted octahedral to nearly perfect
trigonal bipyramidal in 25% of the molecules in the crystal.

based on theoretical calculations, a similar conformation
was predicted for  xxxd2166xxx  bound to zinc-loaded ecmetap
(klein et al. 2003). the other residue in the metal center that
is affected upon binding of  xxxd2800xxx  is glu336, which
donates one of its carboxylate oxygens to co1. in thsmetap1-ov, the noncoordinating oxygen moves away by 0.4 å,
to avoid a close contact (2.9 å) with c5 of  xxxd2800xxx .
discussion
based on homology modeling, all metaps were presumed to have similar active sites. in contrast, however,
it was found that  xxxd2166xxx  and its relatives can inhibit
the type 2 metaps with more than a million-fold higher
affinity than type 1. comparison of the hsmetap2-ov
complex with free ecmetap suggested that this difference might be due to the smaller active site of the type 1
enzymes (liu et al. 1998). the crystal structure of the
 xxxd2800xxx -bound thsmetap1 provides the first opportunity
to test this hypothesis.
comparison of  xxxd2800xxx -bound type 1 and
type 2 human metaps
figure 4a compares the structures of  xxxd2800xxx -bound
human type 1 and type 2 metap. his212 in thsmetap1ov is homologous with his231 in hsmetap2-ov, both
undergoing covalent modification. the residues in the
respective active sites that surround the inhibitor are
different. hsmetap1 has mostly aromatic residues
(pro192, cys203, tyr195, phe198, and phe309), whereas
hsmetap2 has several nonaromatic residues (phe219,

pro220, ile338, met384, his382, and ala414). distances
between the inhibitor and the surrounding residues are
compared in table 2.  xxxd2800xxx  adopts a somewhat different
orientation in the type 1 complex compared with that in
type 2 (fig. 4a). in the former, the  xxxd2800xxx  rotates by
;20° around the covalent linkage, which positions the
isoprenyl group deeper into the active site. despite this
change in orientation, the lone hydrogen bond between the
c4-carbonyl and the main-chain amide of the protein is
preserved (fig. 4a). the limited space in hsmetap1
between his212 and the opposite side of the active site
(near cys301) compared with the corresponding distance in
hsmetap2 (fig. 4b) dictates a change in orientation. in
addition, his212 moves ;0.5 å deeper into the active site,
further contributing to the different alignment. in addition
to the above-mentioned rotation,  xxxd2800xxx  also experiences
a slight tilt (;14°) in the mean plane of the cyclohexanone
ring toward ce1 of his231. one of the reasons for this tilt is
to avoid a steric clash with his310 in its new position. the
overall change in alignment reduces the distance between
the c2-hydroxyl oxygen of the  xxxd2800xxx  and ce1 of his212
by ;0.2 å in thsmetap1-ov from 3.0 å in hsmetap2-ov,
demonstrating the tight fit in the former case.
although  xxxd2166xxx ,  xxxd2800xxx , and  xxxd1330xxx  do not bind
to type 1 metaps as efficiently as they do to the type 2
enzymes, the present study clearly demonstrates that the
active site of human type 1 metap can accommodate such
compounds. there does not appear to be a single reason for
the reduction in the affinity. the smaller size of the active
site is clearly a factor. consistent with this, several active
site residues in hsmetap1 move ‘‘outward’’ in order to
make room for the inhibitor. also there is the reduced space
across the active site shown in figure 4b. another
contributing factor is the relative orientation of his310 in
thsmetap1-ov compared with that of his339 in hsmetap2-ov. a rotation of 134° along ca–cb bond in his310 of
thsmetap1-ov is significantly less than that in the his339
of hsmetap2-ov structure (248°). in the new position
his310 of thsmetap1-ov is coordinated to a third cobalt
ion (fig. 2a). if the his310 of the thsmetap1-ov were to
undergo a rotation of ;250° as in hsmetap2-ov, it would
result in severe steric clash with the methoxy group on c3
of  xxxd2800xxx . the new metal ion presumably contributes to
the binding of  xxxd2800xxx  to type 1 metaps. this suggests
that, apart from the size and shape of the active site, metal
ions may also influence the affinity of  xxxd2800xxx  and related
compounds toward the different metaps.
thr334 in hsmetap1 vs. ala364 in hsmetap2
recently, in a yeast-based screen, it was demonstrated
that a single amino acid change (ala362thr) could render
hsmetap2 resistant to  xxxd2800xxx  (brdlik and crews 2004).
this position in human  xxxg1399xxx  is thr334, which upon

mutation to alanine renders the enzyme sensitive to
 xxxd2800xxx . in thsmetap1-ov thr334 and  xxxd2800xxx  are on
opposite sides of the active site with closest atoms being
6.5 å apart (fig. 5). there are no apparent structural
changes near this residue when  xxxd2800xxx  binds. however,
inspection of the secondary structures of the type 1 and
type 2 enzymes indicates some subtle differences around
this residue, irrespective of the presence or the absence
of  xxxd2800xxx . ala362 in hsmetap2-ov, which is part of the
long b-strand (358–369 residues), forms a hydrogen bond
with the main-chain amide of his331 in the adjacent
strand (fig. 5). but in thsmetap1-ov, og1 of thr334
replaces the main-chain carbonyl in forming the hydrogen
bond with the analogous amide (his303) (3.0 å) (fig. 5).
this leaves the thr334 main-chain carbonyl with no
hydrogen-bonding partner. as a result of rearranged
hydrogen bonding between the b-strands, loss of the
b-sheet structure occurs in this region in thsmetap1
(fig. 5). his303 is adjacent to the cys301 region that
1846

protein science, vol. 15

protrudes ;1.0 å into the entrance of the active site,
restricting the access of  xxxd2800xxx  in hsmetap1. the
thr334ala mutation in hsmetap1 could result in
changes in the residue 334 b-strand as well as in the
neighboring strand including his303. this could expand
the active site by pushing the region around cys301 away
from the entrance. thus the mutant hsmetap1 could
accommodate  xxxd2800xxx  more readily than the native enzyme.
a similar argument can be made suggesting that the
ala392thr mutation in the hsmetap2 results in contraction
of the active site, reducing the affinity for  xxxd2800xxx  (fig. 5).

materials and methods
cloning, expression, and purification
truncated human  xxxg1399xxx  (d1–89) was cloned, expressed,
and purified as described previously (addlagatta et al. 2005).

nitrogen.

data collection, processing, and structure refinement

figure 4. (a) stereo view of the superimposed active sites of thsmetap1-ov
(green) and hsmetap2-ov (gray). the relative orientation of  xxxd2800xxx 
differs somewhat in the two structures. also, his339 in hsmetap2-ov
moves much farther than his310 of thsmetap1-ov. (b) the distance
between ne2 of his212 and the entrance of the active site is shorter (8.1 å)
in thsmetap1 than that in hsmetap2 (8.8 å). this is the region occupied
by the cyclohexanone ring of the inhibitor.

x-ray diffraction data were collected on beamline 8.2.2 at the
advanced light source (als) using a radiation of wavelength
0.977 å. diffraction data were processed by hkl2000 and
scalepack (otwinowski and minor 1997). the structure was
solved by molecular replacement with epmr (kissinger et al.
1999), using the coordinates of the isomorphous native enzyme
(pdb code 2b3k) with all water molecules removed
(addlagatta et al. 2005). after initial rigid-body and simulated
annealing refinement, coordinates and b-factors were refined
and water molecules included using cns (brünger et al. 1998).
initial coordinates for  xxxd2800xxx  were adapted from the complex
with the type 2 enzyme hsmetap2 (pdb code 1b59) (liu et al.
1998) and geometric restraints obtained from the hic-up server
(kleywegt and jones 1998). atomic resolution data made it
possible to avoid any restraints on bond and torsion angles on
the inhibitor during refinement. final refinement (table 1) with
shelx (sheldrick and schneider 1997) included anisotropic
thermal factors. figures for this manuscript were generated
using pymol (delano scientific) and platon (a.l. spek,
utrecht university, utrecht, the netherlands).
