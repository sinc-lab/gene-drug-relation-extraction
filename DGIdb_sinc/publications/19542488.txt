doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00345.2009.—there is substantial evidence supporting a hypertrophic action of serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5ht)] in cardiomyocytes. however, little is known about the mechanisms involved. we previously demonstrated that 5-ht-induced
hypertrophy depends, in part, on the generation of reactive oxygen
species by  xxxg1358xxx -a (mao-a) (see ref. 3). cardiomyocytes express 5-ht2 receptors, which may also participate in
hypertrophy. here, we analyzed the respective contribution of
5-ht2 receptors and mao-a in h9c2 cardiomyoblast hypertrophy. 5-ht induced a dose-dependent increase in [3h]leucine incorporation and stimulation of two markers of cardiac hypertrophy,
anf-luc and ␣sk-actin-luc reporter genes. experiments using 1
␮m 5-ht showed that hypertrophic response occurred independently from mao-a. using pharmacological inhibitors (m100907
and  xxxd2419xxx ), we identified a novel mechanism of action involving 5-ht2a receptors and requiring ca2⫹/calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated t-cell activation. the activation of this hypertrophic pathway was fully prevented by 5-ht2a inhibitors and was
unaffected by mao inhibition. when 10 ␮m 5-ht was used, an
additional hypertrophic response, prevented by the mao inhibitors
 xxxd2850xxx  and ro 41-1049, was observed. unlike the 5-ht2areceptor-mediated h9c2 cell hypertrophy, mao-a-dependent hypertrophic response required activation of extracellular-regulated
kinases. in conclusion, our results show the existence of a dosedependent shift of activation of distinct intracellular pathways
involved in 5-ht-mediated hypertrophy of cardiac cells.

type a; hypertrophy

is a hallmark feature in the
progression of heart failure. increased myocardial mass
characteristic of the compensatory ventricular remodeling
process is primarily attributed to hypertrophy of individual
cardiomyocytes. this process is initiated by a variety of
stimuli, including paracrine and endocrine factors, such as
catecholamines,  xxxg99xxx , endothelin, growth factors,
and inflammatory cytokines (1). in addition, serotonin
[5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)] is believed to play a role in
the regulation of cardiac growth in pathological conditions.
for instance, previous reports demonstrated higher blood
5-ht levels in heart failure patients, which may be due to
either clearance defect or enhanced secretion (7, 17). fur-

thermore, chronic administration of 5-ht in rodents causes
cardiac hypertrophy (9, 13).
a large body of evidence supports a role for cell surface
5-ht2 receptors in cardiac hypertrophy. 5-ht2a and 5-ht2b
receptors are expressed in the heart and are present on both
cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts (10). a role for 5-ht2b
receptors in cardiac hypertrophy has been demonstrated using
knockout mice (11). however, it is now clear that hypertrophic
signaling mediated by 5-ht2b occurs in cardiac fibroblasts,
and not on myocytes, through the release of pro-hypertrophic
cytokines (10, 11). in addition, cardiac fibroblasts express
5-ht2a receptors, which mediate fibroblast migration, differentiation into myofibroblasts, and transforming growth
factor-␤1 secretion in response to 5-ht (24). altogether,
these studies have provided evidence for a role of 5-ht2a
and 5-ht2b receptors present on cardiac fibroblasts in mediating prohypertrophic and profibrotic effects of 5-ht in
the heart.
on the other hand, 5-ht can also act directly on cardiac
myocytes, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. one
study demonstrated that activation of 5-ht2 receptors produced robust hypertrophy in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (5).
however, the subtype of receptor involved (5-ht2a or
5-ht2b) and the signaling mechanisms associated were not
clearly defined. in addition, a receptor-independent pathway
has been characterized in cardiomyocytes (3). this mechanism
required 5-ht uptake into cardiomyocytes, its degradation by
 xxxg1357xxx  (mao-a), and the generation of
reactive oxygen species (ros) (3).
in the present study, we decided to evaluate the respective
contribution of receptor-mediated and mao-mediated mechanisms in cardiac hypertrophy in vitro and to delineate the
intracellular determinants involved. using h9c2 cardiomyoblasts, we provide evidence for a dual mechanism of action of
5-ht through 5-ht2a receptors and mao-a, which signal
through distinct hypertrophic pathways.

cardiomyocyte biology that shows similar hypertrophic and apoptotic
responses as those seen in primary adult and neonatal cardiomyocytes
(12, 22). cells were maintained in mem, supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum and 4 mm glutamine. cells were grown at subconfluence in an atmosphere of 5% co2 and 37°c. they were used below
the 20th passage.
primary cultures of rat cardiomyocytes. cardiomyocytes were
isolated from sprague-dawley rats weighing 200 g, using a protocol
based on previously described procedures (6). rats were handled in
accordance with the procedures outlined in council directive 86/609/
eec. rats were anesthetized with 45 mg/kg ip pentobarbital, and the
heart was rapidly excised, mounted in a langendorff apparatus, and
perfused for 20 min with low-calcium solution (lcs) prewarmed at
37°c [117 mm nacl, 5.7 mm kcl, 4.4 mm nahco3, 1.5 mm
kh2po4, 1.7 mm mgcl2, 11.7 mm d(⫹)-glucose, 21 mm hepes, 20
mm taurine, 10 mm creatine (ph 7.2)]. the solution was then quickly
changed to lcs plus 1 mg/ml collagenase type i, 0.03 mg/ml dispase
(worthington biochemicals), and 1 mg/ml albumin for 10 min. the
heart was minced, and the pieces were stirred in lcs. cardiomyocytes present in the supernatant were purified by gravity sedimentation, collected, and stored in lcs supplemented with 1 mg/ml bsa
and 4% penicillin-streptomycin at room temperature. calcium was
then added stepwise up to a concentration of 312 ␮m at room
temperature. cardiomyocytes were collected after sedimentation at
rt and plated on culture plate covered with 100 ␮g/ml laminin in
dmem containing penicillin-streptomycin. after 2 h, the dishes were
washed twice with dmem to eliminate nonadherent cells, and cells
were stimulated for 36 h.
plasmid constructs and transfection. plasmid construct with luciferase reporter gene linked to promoter for skeletal muscle ␣-actin
(sk-act-luc) was provided by dr m. d. schneider (18). the luciferase reporter plasmid driven by four nuclear factor of activated
t-cell (nfat) consensus binding sites (nfat-luc) and the control plasmid pfr-luc were obtained from stratagene (agilent
technologies, massy, france). anf-luc reporter gene was made
by amplification of atrial natriuretic factor (anf) promoter (⫺638
to ⫹65) from rat genomic dna, sequencing, and cloning into
 xxxg2041xxx -basic vector (promega france, charbonnières, france). stable cell lines were obtained by transfection of h9c2 cells using

lipofectamine 2000 reagent (invitrogen, cergy pontoise, france).
mass pools of stable transfectants were selected in growth medium
containing 0.75 mg/ml  xxxg418xxx . cells were serum starved in mem
supplemented with 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum 24 h before
experiments.
luciferase detection assay. expression of luciferase was monitored
with the luciferase assay system (promega france) on a luminometer (mithras lb940, berthold technologies, thoiry, france).
assays of mao activity. crude extracts of proteins from h9c2 cells
(40 ␮g) were incubated at 37°c for 20 min, in the presence of 400 ␮m
of [14c]serotonin or 100 ␮m of ␤-[14c]phenylethylamine to measure
mao-a and mao-b activities, respectively (16). to define nonspecific activities, mao-a inhibitor  xxxd1730xxx  and mao-b inhibitor
deprenyl were used (0.1 ␮m). the reaction was ended by the addition
of 0.1 ml of hcl, 4 n at 4°c. the reaction product was extracted
(efficiency 92%) with 1 ml of ethyl acetate/toluene (vol/vol), and the
radioactivity contained in the organic phase was counted in a liquid
scintillation spectrometer.
rt-pcr experiments. extraction of rna was performed using
column affinity purification (masherey-nagel, hoerdt, france). firststrand cdna was synthesized using the superscript ii rt-pcr system
(invitrogen, cergy pontoise, france) with random hexamers. negative
controls without reverse transcriptase were made to verify the absence
of genomic dna contamination. pcr amplification was performed
using platinum-taq dna enzyme (invitrogen) in a volume of 20 ␮l. the
primers were as followed:  xxxg861xxx -f, atggtgaaggtcggtgtgaacg;  xxxg861xxx -r, cttccacgatgccaaagttgtc; 5-ht2a-f,

5-ht and hypertrophic signaling

results

5-ht stimulates protein synthesis and hypertrophic gene
expression in cardiomyoblasts. chronic exposure of h9c2
cells to 5-ht dose-dependently increased [3h]leucine incorporation (fig. 1a), total protein content (fig. 1b), anf mrna
expression (fig. 1c), and anf-luc promoter construct (fig.
1d), indicating that h9c2 cells exposed to 5-ht exhibit
several major characteristics of hypertrophy. ␣sk-actin
mrna and luciferase constructs were also dose-dependently activated by 5-ht (data not shown). maximal hypertrophic signal was observed with 10 ␮m 5-ht and was
comparable to phenylephrine, an ␣1-adrenergic receptor
agonist used as a positive control. 5-ht (10 ␮m) did not
trigger proliferation of cardiomyoblasts, as measured by
[3h]thymidine incorporation and cell number (supplemental
fig. 1). (the online version of this article contains supplemental data.)
participation of mao-a in hypertrophic response mediated
by 5-ht. h9c2 express mao-a but not mao-b, as known for
adult rat cardiomyocytes (fig. 2a). to assess the importance of

mao-a in protein synthesis and hypertrophic gene expression
mediated by 5-ht, we measured [3h]leucine incorporation and
␣sk-actin-luc in the presence of an irreversible mao inhibitor,  xxxd2850xxx  (10 ␮m).  xxxd2850xxx  blocked both parameters at
high doses of 5-ht (10 ␮m), but not at low doses (1 ␮m) (fig.
2b).  xxxd2298xxx  generation by mao-a has been
shown to be responsible for the hypertrophic response mediated by 5-ht in adult rat ventricular myocytes. indeed, application of the ros scavenger nac (1 mm), and application of
the selective mao-a antagonist ro-41–1049 (1 ␮m), blocked
[3h]leucine incorporation and anf-luc stimulation with 10
␮m 5-ht (fig. 2c).
contribution of 5-ht receptors in cardiac cell hypertrophy.
results observed in fig. 2 suggest that another mechanism,
activated by low levels of 5-ht (1 ␮m), may be present in

( xxxg2150xxx ), h9c2 cells express mrna for serotonin 5-ht2a and

5-ht and hypertrophic signaling

with  xxxg861xxx  (15.8), whereas 5-ht2c,  xxxg1117xxx , and 5-ht7 were
undetectable. since 5-ht2a receptors are predominantly expressed in h9c2 cells, we measured protein synthesis and
hypertrophic gene expression using m100907 (0.1 ␮m), a
selective  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist.  xxxg1113xxx  blockade antagonized [3h]leucine incorporation (fig. 3b) and anfluc stimulation (fig. 3c) at low and high doses of 5-ht.
another  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist  xxxd2419xxx  had the same
effect (fig. 1, d and e). on the other hand, 5-ht2b selective
antagonist sb-206553 (0.1 ␮m) induced small but nonsignificant inhibition of the 5-ht response.
participation of 5-ht2a receptors in the hypertrophic response mediated by 5-ht was verified in primary culture of
adult ventricular myocytes. rt-pcr analysis indicated that
ventricular myocytes, as cardiomyoblasts, expressed 5-ht2a
(ct ⫽ 25.3), 5-ht2b (ct ⫽ 33.9),  xxxg2150xxx  (ct ⫽ 31.5), and
mao-a (ct ⫽ 29.9) (fig. 4a). incubation of cardiomyocytes
with 5-ht (10 ␮m) for 36 h promoted increase in cell area,
which was fully inhibited by 5-ht2a antagonist m100907
(fig. 4b).
 xxxg1113xxx  activates the calcineurin/nfat pathway.
5-ht2a receptors are g␣q-coupled receptors, which are known
to promote intracellular ca2⫹ elevation, followed by calcineurin/nfat pathway activation. in h9c2 cells, application
of the calcium scavenger egta (5 mm) or the calcineurin
inhibitor csa (1 ␮m) blocked 5-ht-mediated hypertrophic
gene expression (fig. 5a). these results prompted us to measure direct activation of nfat, using a reporter construct
harboring four nfat binding sites in front of the luciferase

gene. 5-ht produced robust activation of nfat, which was
reversed by egta and csa (fig. 5b). activation of nfat by
5-ht was blocked by m100907, but not by sb-206553, indicating that 5-ht2a receptors were responsible for this activation (fig. 5c). in addition, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine
hydrochloride (doi), a  xxxg1113xxx  agonist, but not
bw723c86 (a  xxxg1114xxx  agonist), was sufficient to
promote nfat activation (fig. 5d). interestingly, application
of  xxxd2850xxx  failed to inhibit nfat activation by 5-ht, which
confirms that this pathway is independent of mao-a.
role of mapk pathway in hypertrophic response mediated
by 5-ht. erk protein kinases, in coordination with calcineurin/nfat, constitute a major route for hypertrophic
growth of cardiomyocytes. in our experiments, we demonstrated that mek inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx  fully blocked 5-ht (10
␮m)-induced [3h]leucine incorporation and anf-luc stimulation in cardiomyoblasts (fig. 6a). 5-ht produced robust phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 kinases, with an early peak at 5 min and
an attenuated stimulation, which remained stable until 60 min
(fig. 5b). we investigated whether erk phosphorylation by
5-ht was mediated through  xxxg1113xxx -dependent or
mao-dependent pathway. blockade of mao-a with  xxxd2850xxx  or nac completely prevented erk phosphorylation by
5-ht, whereas m100907 had no effect (fig. 6, c and d).
therefore, as previously demonstrated in adult ventricular
myocytes, erk mapk pathway is dependent on mao-a
activation in our model.
discussion

in the present study, we demonstrated that extracellular
5-ht concentration was determinant for activation of receptordependent or mao-a-dependent hypertrophic pathways. at
low doses, 5-ht stimulated cardiac cell hypertrophy through
activation of 5-ht2a receptors and stimulation of the ca2⫹/
calcineurin/nfat pathway. higher doses of 5-ht produced an
additional hypertrophic effect that was dependent on mao-a/
h2o2/erk pathway (fig. 7).
experiments performed at low 5-ht concentrations allowed
us to identify, for the first time, 5-ht2a receptors as the
mediators of the receptor-dependent hypertrophic activity of
5-ht in cardiac cells. the role of these receptors in cardiac
hypertrophy has been supported by various results in vivo.
indeed, we showed that, in a mouse model of increased plasma
5-ht, 5-ht2a but not 5-ht2b receptors were involved in
pressure overload hypertrophy (15). other studies showed that
5-ht2a receptors mediated positive inotropic response in ventricular myocytes and were overexpressed in different models
of cardiac hypertrophy, along with human heart failure (4, 20).
in addition,  xxxg1113xxx  blockade reverses hypertrophy
during pressure overload and reduces left ventricular hypertrophy during hypertension (8, 15). 5-ht2b receptors have also
been implicated in ventricular hypertrophy. however, converging evidence suggests that 5-ht2b receptors on nonmyocytes
contribute to ventricular hypertrophy (10, 11). indeed, it has
been shown that 5-ht2b receptors on cardiac fibroblasts mediate the release of il-6 and indirectly induce cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy. our results supply new insight on the cell mechanisms involved in the receptor-mediated hypertrophy of cardiac cells by 5-ht. indeed, in addition to the recognition of
5-ht2a receptors as the main target of 5-ht, we identified the

ca2⫹/calcineurin/nfat pathway as a major determinant in
cardiac cell hypertrophy. calcineurin, acting via its downstream effector nfat, plays a key role in cardiac hypertrophy
and is sufficient to initiate and propagate hypertrophic growth
of the heart in animal models (23).
higher doses of 5-ht promoted stronger hypertrophic stimulation that involved an additional pathway requiring ros
generation by mao-a and activation of erk mapk. we
found that  xxxg1113xxx  stimulation was still required for
hypertrophic response generated with high doses of 5-ht.
therefore, erk activation may not be sufficient to propagate
the hypertrophic response alone and may act in cooperation
with the calcineurin/nfat pathway. at present, the potential
interconnections between calcineurin and erk signaling in our
model are uncertain. since mao-a inhibitor did not prevent
5-ht-induced nfat activation, we can assume that cooperaajp-heart circ physiol • vol

tion did not occur directly on calcineurin activation, nfat
dephosphorylation, or nfat translocation into the nucleus.
one possibility would be that erk activation allows the
formation of transcriptional complexes with nfat in cardiomyocytes. in an interesting study, sanna et al. (21) demonstrated that  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling could enhance hypertrophic gene
expression by the induction of the transcription factor activator
protein-1, which functioned as an essential nfat-interacting
partner in cardiac cells.
our results show that extracellular concentrations of 5-ht
are critical for discrimination between  xxxg1113xxx  and
mao-a hypertrophic pathways. at present, the relative weight
of 5-ht2a and mao-a pathways in ventricular hypertrophy in
vivo is still unclear. peripheral 5-ht is mainly stored in
platelets and is released during platelet activation. therefore,
the extent of platelet activation and 5-ht release may deter-

5-ht and hypertrophic signaling

effect of 5-ht in h9c2 cells. a: [3h]leucine
experiments and anf-luc stimulation were
performed to assess the impact of mek inhibition by  xxxd1169xxx  (50 ␮m) in h9c2 cells
stimulated by 5-ht in etoh (1%). b: immunoblotting experiments performed with erk
phosphorylation (perk) antibody demonstrated that 5-ht induced strong activation of
erk with a pick at 5 min. immunoblots are

mine the activation of  xxxg1113xxx  or mao-a pathways in
vivo. this hypothesis is supported by our laboratory’s recent
results showing that, in the case of a moderate increase in
circulating 5-ht,  xxxg1113xxx  but not mao-a are involved in pressure overload hypertrophy (15). on the other
hand, we have also shown that, in the model of cardiac
ischemia-reperfusion, which could be considered as an extreme
model of platelet activation and 5-ht release, ventricular
damage is fully dependent on mao-a/h2o2 pathway (2, 19).
based on our results, it is conceivable that mao-a hypertrophic pathway may be relevant in pathological situations associated with sustained platelet activation and/or increase in
cardiac mao-a activity, such as aging or during the transition
to heart failure (14, 16).

in conclusion, we identified a dual mechanism of action of
5-ht in cardiac hypertrophy via a mao-a and receptordependent pathway. we produced the first evidence for a role
of  xxxg1113xxx  in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. moreover,
we found that mao-a activation generated a hypertrophic
response through erk stimulation, whereas the  xxxg1113xxx  acted through calcineurin/nfat activation in cardiomyoblasts. these results open new avenues for the comprehension
of the mechanisms of action of 5-ht in the heart.
