centrally acting antihypertensives: a renaissance of interest. mechanisms and haemodynamics.  classic centrally acting antihypertensives are known to stimulate  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors located in the pontomedullary region, in the vicinity of the nucleus tractus solitarii, vasomotor centre, vagal nucleus and the various interconnecting neurones. the stimulation of these central  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptors induces peripheral sympathoinhibition and hence a reduction in (elevated) blood pressure, predominantly as a result of vasodilation and a consequent decrease in peripheral vascular resistance.
