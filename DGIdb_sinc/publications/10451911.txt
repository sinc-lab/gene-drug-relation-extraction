abstract
in the present study the effects of acute po-administration of 15 mg mirtazapine on the
growth hormone (gh), prolactin (prl), and cortisol (cor) secretion were examined in
eight physically and mentally healthy male subjects, compared to placebo. mirtazapine is a
new antidepressant agent which does not inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine or serotonin
but is an antagonist of presynaptic and, presumably, postsynaptic a2-receptors as well as an
antagonist of postsynpatic 5-ht2 and 5-ht3-receptors. after insertion of an iv catheter,
blood samples were drawn 1 h prior to the administration of mirtazapine or placebo, at time
of application, and during the time of 4 h after application in periods of 30 min. plasma
concentrations of gh, prl, and cor were determined in each blood sample by double
antibody ria methods. the area under the curve (auc) value was used as parameter for
the gh, prl, and cor response. with respect to gh and prl secretion, mirtazapine did
not show any effects in comparison with placebo. however, in all subjects, the cor
concentrations were remarkably lower after mirtazapine compared to placebo, the difference
being obvious in the mean value graphs 60 min after the application up to the end of the
measurement period. the t-test for paired samples revealed a highly significant difference
(pb 0.01) in cor-auc-values between the mirtazapine group (mean cor-auc: 1558.07
mg/100 ml×240 min) and the placebo group (mean cor-auc: 2698.86 mg/100 ml×240
min). further studies have to elucidate the question whether the demonstrated inhibition of
cor secretion after application of 15 mg mirtazapine is caused by central or peripheral
effects of this substance. © 1999 elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
it is well established that psychotropic drugs affect the central aminergic neurons
which assert for their part an influence on the secretion of pituitary hormones.
psychotropic drugs with different effects on the central neurotransmitter system can
be demonstrated to have distinct effects on the anterior pituitary hormone secretion
(laakmann, 1987; laakmann et al., 1990a,b); therefore, psychotropic agents can be
characterized by certain pharmacoendocrinological profiles (table 1). antidepressants which primarily act via noradrenaline (na)-reuptake inhibition (e.g. desimipramine, [dmi]) stimulate growth hormone (gh)-secretion (laakmann et al.,
1981), whereas serotonin (5-ht)-reuptake inhibiting antidepressants (e.g. indalpine,
chlorimipramine) are characterized by prl-stimulation (laakmann, 1987). cortisol
(cor)-secretion can acutely be increased by antidepressants with both na- or
5-ht-reuptake inhibition; the stimulatory effects of antidepressants on cor secretion are mediated via stimulation of the acth output of the pituitary gland
(laakmann, 1987).
in this study the gh-, cor-, and prl-secretion after po-application of 15 mg
mirtazapine was measured and compared to placebo. mirtazapine is a new antidepressant which does not inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine or serotonin but is
an antagonist of presynaptic and, presumably, postsynaptic a2-receptors as well as
an antagonist of postsynpatic 5-ht2 and 5-ht3-receptors (de boer, 1995). average
peak plasma concentrations (cmax) are achieved 2 h after oral dosing and an
elimination half-life of 20 – 40 h (timmer et al., 1997). the aim of the present
investigation was to work out a pharmacoendocrinological profile of mirtazapine in
order to compare its endocrinological effects with the effects of other
antidepressants.

2. subjects and methods

2.1. study population and study design
eight healthy male subjects of normal weight, age 20–35 years, were included
upon receipt of their informed consent and following a clinical examination
(psychiatric and medical history, physical examination) and establishment of normal laboratory parameters (hb, k + , na + , got, gpt, g-gt, blood sugar,
bilirubin and serum creatinine, heart rate, electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram). alcohol abstinence 24 h prior to each experiment and abstinence from
medication beginning 4 weeks before the study were mandatory. subjects fasted
from completion of the evening meal until conclusion of the experiment. each
subject took part two times in the trial; in a randomized order the volunteers
received placebo or mirtazapine (15 mg po) on two different days. at 07:00 h9 30
min, an iv catheter was inserted into the antecubital vein and kept open with
physiological saline solution. the subjects rested in bed throughout the experiments. at t = − 60 min, t = 0 min (application of placebo or mirtazapine), and at
30 min intervals thereafter up to t = 240 min, blood was drawn. serum was
separated by centrifugation as soon as possible, frozen at −20oc, and stored for
the assay of hormone concentrations. plasma concentrations of gh, prl, and
cor were determined in each blood sample. gh, prl, and cor levels were
determined by double-antibody ria (radio immuno assay) methods. the sensitivity
(‘minimal detectable dose’) was approximately 0.22 mg/100 ml for the cor ria;
0.03 nu/l for the gh ria; and 1.44 mu/l for the prl ria. the specifity was very
high for the rias with an extremely low cross-reactivity to other natural hormones;
the cross-reactivity (in percent) was 6.8% for the cor ria (the normal physiological concentrations of other steroids are low compared to cor so as not to
significantly interfere in the double antibody cor procedure); 0.1% for the gh
ria; andb 0.01% for the prl ria. the total variation (% cv) was 6.6% for the
cor ria; 3.9% for the gh ria; and 2.7% for the prl ria. blood pressure
(diastolic pressure, rrdia; systolic pressure, rrsys) was measured by the riva-rocci
method every 30 min; the mean arterial blood pressure (map) was calculated
according the rule map= rrdia +1/3(rrsys − rrdia) and served as parameter for
assessing the blood pressure effects of mirtazapine. furthermore, heart rate and
side effects which occurred in the course of the experiment were recorded every 30
min. with respect to sedation the volunteers had to answer every 30 min if they
were not sedated, mildly sedated or strongly sedated. the study was carried out
according to the revised version (hongkong, 1989) of the declaration of helsinki
(1964) and had been approved by an ethics committee.

2.2. statistical e6aluation
in addition to the descriptive and graphical evaluation of the mean curves of the
hormone concentrations measured, the areas under the curve (aucs, 0–240 min)
were calculated according to simpson (1956), representing the total gh-, prl-,

772

and cor-secretion following po-application of placebo or mirtazapine (15 mg),
and were tested for significant differences using the t-test for paired samples.

3. results

3.1. gh-secretion
no gh-stimulation could be observed after placebo as well after 15 mg mirtazapine po (fig. 1). during the whole time (t= 0 min up to t= 240 min), the mean
gh concentrations were lower than 5 ng/ml for the placebo group as well as for the
mirtazapine group. the slight elevations of the mean value graphs which can be
seen in the figure were due to gh secretion peaks of one volunteer which occurred
both after placebo and after mirtazapine. the gh-auc-values were comparable
after placebo (mean gh-auc: 364.95 ng/ml × 240 min) and after 15 mg mirtazapine po (mean gh-auc: 353.51 ng/ml × 240 min). no significant result could be
demonstrated in the t-test for paired samples (p\ 0.05).

3.2. prl-secretion
no prl stimulation was seen in healthy subjects who had received 15 mg
mirtazapine (fig. 2). the mean prl concentrations were comparable after placebo
and mirtazapine. the t-test for paired samples did not reveal any significant
difference between the mean prl – auc-values (placebo: 42206.25 mu/ml × 240
min; mirtazapine: 39845.00 mu/ml × 240 min).

3.3. cor secretion
initially (t = − 60 min up to t = 0 min) a considerable decrease of cor
concentrations occurred which was comparable between the mirtazapine group and
the placebo group (fig. 3). in the following time of the measurement period (t= 0
min up to t = 240 min), in the placebo group a further reduction of cor
concentrations could be seen which was very slight. concerning the individual data,
the lowest cor concentration after placebo was 5.59 mg/100 ml (t= 150 min; see
table 2); with respect to mean values the minimum of cor concentrations during
placebo conditions was 10.14 mg/100 ml (t= 240 min). after mirtazapine (15 mg
po), a remarkable decrease of cor concentrations occurred which was considerably more pronounced than after placebo (fig. 3, table 2) (a) mirtazapine
conditions, individual data: minimum of cor concentrations 1.94 mg/100 ml,
t= 240 min; b) mirtazapine conditions, mean values: minimum of cor concentrations 3.92 mg/100 ml, t =180 min). 60 min after application of mirtazapine or
placebo, respectively, the mean cor concentrations were clearly lower in the
mirtazapine group in comparison to the placebo group, the difference being
obvious up to the end of the measurement period (fig. 3, table 2). the mean
cor–auc-value was considerably reduced in the mirtazapine group (mean

cor–auc: 1558.07 mg/100 ml) compared to the placebo group (mean cor–
auc: 2698.86 mg/100 ml). the t-test for paired samples revealed a highly significant difference (p b 0.01).

3.4. mean arterial pressure (map) and pulse rate
with respect to the mean arterial pressure and the pulse rate, there were no
significant differences in auc values between the placebo group and the mirtazapine group (t-test for paired samples: p \ 0.05). details concerning blood pressure
and heart rate are presented in figs. 4 and 5.

3.5. side effects
no side effects occurred in the placebo group. all volunteers reported feeling
sedated after application of mirtazapine. thirty minutes after application of mirtazapine three out of eight volunteers were mildly sedated; 60 min after administration of mirtazapine seven volunteers were strongly sedated, one volunteer was only
mildly sedated. the sedation continued for 3–5 h. no other side effects could be
demonstrated after administration of 15 mg mirtazapine po, in particular no
anticholinergic or cardiovascular side effects.

4. discussion
in the present study mirtazapine did not display any effects on gh and prl
secretion whereas the measurement of cor concentrations revealed a highly
significant reduction of cor release after 15 mg mirtazapine po compared to
placebo (p b 0.01). since antidepressants inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine
or serotonin generally are known to acutely stimulate cor secretion (laakmann,
1987), the results of our endocrinological investigation in human beings seem to
reflect the special mechanism of action of mirtazapine which has been investigated
in several animal studies: unlike other antidepressants mirtazapine does not inhibit
the reuptake of norepinephrine (na) or serotonin (5-ht) but is an antagonist of
presynaptic and, presumably, postsynaptic a2-receptors as well as an antagonist of
postsynaptic 5-ht2 and 5-ht3 receptors (de boer, 1995). mirtazapine enhances
na release by blocking a2-autoreceptors (de boer, 1995; de boer and ruigt, 1995;
de boer et al., 1995); serotonergic neurotransmission is also increased by mirtazapine, especially in the hippocampus (de boer et al., 1996; haddjeri et al., 1996,
1997). furthermore, mirtazapine is an antihistaminergic agent with a high affinity
for histamine h1 receptors (de boer et al., 1988).
as can be demonstrated in our study, the gh secretion is not influenced by
administration of 15 mg mirtazapine po. psychotropic drugs with na agonistic
properties like the a2-agonist clonidine (matussek et al., 1980) or the na reuptake
inhibitor desimipramine (dmi) (laakmann et al., 1981) are known to acutely
stimulate gh release in men. thus, the lack of effects of mirtazapine on gh

secretion does not confirm the assumption of acute agonistic effects of mirtazapine
on the noradrenergic system, given in the dosage mentioned above. probably, the
antagonistic effects of mirtazapine on a2-receptors occur not only presynaptically
thereby increasing the na release, but also postsynaptically. our results suggest
that the presumed enhancement of na release caused by mirtazapine do not lead
to stimulation of gh secretion since postsynaptic a2-receptors which are responsible for stimulatory effects on gh output are blocked by mirtazapine at the same
time. in this context, it has to be mentioned that yohimbine, an a2-blocker, is able
to significantly reduce the dmi-induced gh stimulation by postsynaptic a2-blockade in men (laakmann et al., 1986a). given alone, yohimbine does not have any
influence on gh secretion like mirtazapine (laakmann et al., 1982). furthermore,
it is worth to be discussed that the a2-blocker idazoxan seems to cause a modest
increase of gh in men (schmidt et al., 1997). according to schmidt and his
colleagues the explanation for this result is that idazoxan has a higher affinity for
presynaptic a2-receptors (leading to an increased na release) than for postsynaptic
a2-receptors (blocking the stimulatory effects of na on gh secretion); thus, the
enhanced na release overcomes the moderate blockade of postsynaptic a2-receptors thereby increasing the gh secretion.
the lacking influence of mirtazapine on prl secretion which can be seen in the
present investigation has to be interpreted in the light of its presumed two-fold
modulation of serotonergic transmission. first, mirtazapine blocks a2-adrenoceptors thereby enhancing noradrenergic transmission and facilitates serotonergic
transmission via an a1-mediated adrenergic enhancement of cell firing at the level of
the serotonergic cell bodies of dorsal raphe neurons. second, mirtazapine blocks
a2-heteroceptors at the level of serotonergic terminals thereby enhancing 5-ht
release (de boer et al., 1996; haddjeri et al., 1996, 1997). thus, mirtazapine
apparently stimulates 5-ht1a-receptors in an indirect manner whereas 5-ht2- and
5-ht3-receptors are directly blocked by mirtazapine. however, the adrenergic
modulation of serotonergic transmission caused by mirtazapine seems to be region
specific: haddjeri as well as de boer could only demonstrate an adrenergic
enhancement of serotonergic transmission in the hippocampus, not in the striatum
in accordance with the assumption that raphe nuclei modulate differentially
hippocampal and striatal 5-ht-transmission and that a2-heteroceptors of serotonergic terminals are in particular localized in the hippocampus. whereas direct
5-ht1a-receptor agonists like ipsapirone or buspirone (cowen et al., 1990) and
5-ht-reuptake inhibitors like indalpine or chlorimipramine (laakmann, 1987)
stimulate prl release, indirect serotonergic agonists like mirtazapine fail to cause
a prl stimulation because the part of the serotonergic system which modulates
prl release is obviously not activated by the noradrenergic system.
the initial decrease of cor (t = −60 min up to t= 0 min) observed both in the
mirtazapine group and the placebo group can be explained best by the circadian
rhythm of cor secretion (maximum of cor concentrations early at the morning
followed by a reduction of cor levels); furthermore, it has to be taken into
consideration that the insertion of the catheter in a forearm vein (t= − 60 min)
induces a stress-related raise of acth- and cor concentrations which decreases

during the hour prior to the administration of mirtazapine or placebo. the highly
significant reduction of cor secretion by mirtazapine which can be demonstrated
in our study has to be discussed regarding the a2- and 5-ht2/5-ht3-receptor
blocking properties of mirtazapine and its suggested indirect na- and 5-ht-agonistic effects. yohimbine, an a2-blocker, is shown to increase the dmi-induced cor
stimulation whereas  xxxd3000xxx , an a1-blocker, is seen to diminish the cor stimulation after administration of dmi (laakmann et al., 1986b) suggesting inhibitory
effects of central a2-receptors and stimulatory effects of central a1-receptors on
cor secretion. given alone, cor release from the adrenal gland is not influenced
by yohimbine (laakmann et al., 1982). the antidepressant trazodone is demonstrated to inhibit cor secretion via a1-antagonistic effects (monteleone, 1991). in
the face of the presumed a2-blocking and weak a1-agonistic properties of mirtazapine and the demonstrated increase of dmi-induced cor stimulation by the
a2-blocker yohimbine (laakmann et al., 1986b) one would rather expect stimulatory effects of mirtazapine on cor secretion than the inhibition of cor release
observed in our study.
with respect to serotonergic neurotransmission, 5-ht reuptake inhibitors like
indalpine or chlorimipramine (laakmann, 1987) and direct 5-ht1a-agonists like
buspirone (cowen et al., 1990; laakmann et al., 1994) or ipsapirone (lesch et al.,
1990) are seen to stimulate cor secretion. therefore, the cor inhibition by
mirtazapine can not be put down to its presumed indirect 5-ht1a-agonistic effects.
different reports have demonstrated that both the synthesis and release of
corticotropin releasing factor (crf) by hypothalamic tissues in vitro (buckingham
and hodges, 1979; jones et al., 1979) and in vivo (imura et al., 1973; lewis &
sherman, 1984; nakanishi et al., 1979) are stimulated by 5-hydroxytryptamine and
that the antiserotonergic drug  xxxd1785xxx  inhibits these effects (jones et al.,
1979). it seems that 5-ht is one of the physiological factors involved in crf
stimulation at the hypothalamic level (cavagnini et al., 1976). the inhibitory effect
of  xxxd1785xxx  on acth secretion via crh is thought to be responsible for the
positive results observed in some patients with cushing disease treated by  xxxd1785xxx  (krieger et al., 1975; krieger and luria, 1976). furthermore, it has been
shown that activation of 5-ht1a-, 5-ht2a- and 5-ht2c-, but not 5-ht3-receptors
results in elevated levels of plasma corticosterone; according to berendsen et al.
(1996) serotonergic modulation of acth release via crf plays an important role
in this context. in the face of these studies concerning the serotonergic modulation
of cor secretion, it seems to be very likely that the cor inhibition seen after
application of mirtazapine is at least in parts caused by its 5-ht2a- and 5-ht2c-receptor blocking properties.
besides serotonergic transmission, the neurotransmitter histamine (ha) has also
to be taken into account. ha stimulates the release of acth via activation of
central postsynaptic h1- or h2-receptors; the effect of ha is indirect and may
involve the hypothalamic regulating factors crh and  xxxd3495xxx  (kjaer
et al., 1992). in normal human volunteers, the selective h1-receptor antagonist
meclastine is able to inhibit the acth and cor stimulation in the insulin
hypoglycemia test whereas gh and prl concentrations are unaffected (allolio et

782

g. laakmann et al. / psychoneuroendocrinology 24 (1999) 769–784

al., 1983). in rats antidepressants which display a h1-antihistaminergic activity like imipramine, doxepin,  xxxd2637xxx , desipramine, and amitriptyline suppress
significantly the histamine-induced acth-release (reilly and siegg, 1982).
regarding these human and animal studies, the h1-blocking effects of mirtazapine may also play a role in the cor inhibition demonstrated in our investigation.
furthermore, it has to be pointed out that dose-dependent effects must be
taken into consideration because preclinical data suggest that the dose at which
a2-antogonistic effects of mirtazapine can be demonstrated in vivo are an order
of magnitude above the dose that produces 5-ht2 antagonism (de boer, 1995).
it is worth to be mentioned, too, that mirtazapine (30 mg) increases significantly
nocturnal plasma melatonin concentrations in normal volunteers (palazidou et
al., 1989); to the opinion of palazidou and colleagues, this result can be explained by the a2-antagonistic effects of mirtazapine and supports the existence
of an a2-adrenergic influence on melatonin secretion in man.
the lacking change of blood pressure and pulse rate after po-application of
15 mg mirtazapine also points out that in our study design the known a2antagonistic properties of mirtazapine can not be demonstrated. in contrast
to mirtazapine in the present study, the a2-blocker yohimbine leads to a considerable dose-dependent increase of blood pressure (laakmann et al., 1982),
whereas clonidine, an a2-agonist, can therapeutically be used as an antihypertensive drug.
mirtazapine has a low affinity for muscarinic, cholinergic and dopaminergic
receptors and does not inhibit dopamine reuptake (de boer et al., 1988). therefore, it is not surprising that anticholinergic (disturbance of accommodation,
obstipation, dry mouth, and urinary retention) and dopaminergic side effects did
not occur in the present study. the acute sedative effects of administration of 15
mg mirtazapine which could be demonstrated in each subject can be explained
by its antihistaminergic effects. mirtazapine has a high affinity for histamine h1
receptors (de boer et al., 1988). the observation that the sedative effects of
mirtazapine are more pronounced in lower doses (15 mg/day) than in higher
doses (30 – 60 mg/day) can probably put down to the activation of the noradrenergic system caused by mirtazapine, which has an arousal effect and is more
extensive in higher doses. thus, the a2-receptor-mediated alerting effect may
functionally compensate for the anti-histamine-related sedative potential of mirtazapine at higher doses (de boer, 1995).
