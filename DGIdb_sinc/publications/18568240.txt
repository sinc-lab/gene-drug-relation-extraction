insights into the regulation of tnf-alpha production in human mononuclear cells: the effects of non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibition.  the objective of this study was to determine the effect of nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibition on transcription factor activation and  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf-alpha) production in lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated human mononuclear cells.
