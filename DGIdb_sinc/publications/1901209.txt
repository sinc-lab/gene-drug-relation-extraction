abstract-the
binding of [‘h]acetazolamide (az), a carbonic anhydrase (ca) inhibitor, to soluble and
particulate forms of ca was investigated. sources for the assays were purified ca ii, adult rat cortical,
oligodendrocyte and neuronal enriched preparations; cultured murine glial cells, rat c-6 glioma, rat
hepatoma and human ~ioblastoma cells. ca enzyme activity in the same preparations was also assayed
by following change in ph during incubation. a gel permeation chromatographic method was developed
to assess [3h]az binding to soluble ca, while glass fiber filter vacuum filtration was used for particulate
ca binding. saturable specific binding of [‘h]az to rat cortical soluble and particulate ca preparations
was demonstrated. computer-assisted data analysis estimated the binding parameters of i3hh]azto
soluble rat cortical ca to be b,, = 0.38 + 0.13 pmol/mg protein and & = 34.7 t 17.5 nm. the rat
cortical particulate fraction b,,, was 2.05 ? 0.28 pmol/mg protein with a kdof 107.1 f 24.2 nm. purified
bovine  xxxg293xxx  bound 1.15 2 0.19 pmol [-‘h]az/mg protein with a kd of 54.0 f 3.4 nm. the ph optima
for [3h]az binding to soluble and particulate ca was between 6.5 and 7.5. binding was linear with
respect to protein up to 1.omg/ml. the particulate fraction bound 3-4 times more [3h]ligand per unit
protein than the soluble fraction. interestingly, no detectable ca enzyme activity or t3h]az binding
was observed in the soluble or particulate fractions of human glioblastoma, rat c-6 glioma or rat
hepatoma cells. binding of [‘h]az to other soluble enzymes or proteins was negligible. in competition
binding experiments, a rank order of inhibition of [3h]az binding to rat cortical ca by established ca
inhibitors was:  xxxd1872xxx 
> acetazolamide s,  xxxd307xxx  >  xxxd2592xxx  > hydr~hlorothi~ide
3 sulfa~lamide. [‘h]az binding was not affected by other classes of pha~a~logic
characterizing agents. the binding of 13h]az to the ca enzyme molecule is highly specific and sensitive
and may prove useful in vitroor in situ as a probe for this enzyme.

the use of immunological or radiochemical probes
for the identification
and characterization
of
recognition sites is well documented.
studies on
radioligand receptor binding are numerous; however,
only a limited number of studies have used
equilibrium
radioligand binding to characterize
enzyme recognition domains. for example, immunocytochemical probes for the ca ii isozyme have
been utilized as an enzyme marker for identifi~tion
of choroid plexus papiflomas [8]. additionally, ca
activity in brain increases with age [9] and exhibits
an unequal regional distribution in homogenates,
using either immunocytochemistry
or direct enzyme
activity measurements [lo).
sulfonamides are potent inhibitors of ca [ll].
the well-known sulfonamide, acetazolamide, is a
non-competitive
reversible enzyme inhibitor with
respect to coz [12] and is used clinically for the
effective mana ement of glaucoma, edema and
epilepsies [ 131. [gh]az has been used to label human
ca i employing equilibrium dialysis techniques [12].
the present study characterizes
the binding
parameters of [3hja’z to soluble and particulate ca
enzyme sources from normal rat brain tissue
homogenates, bulkisolated cells, transformedrodent
and human cells, and purified bovine  xxxg293xxx .

carbonic anhydrase (ca) (ec 421.1.)
is a zinccontaining metalloenzyme ubiquitously distributed
in many vertebrate and invertebrate tissues, plants
and bacteria [see refs. 1 and 2 for reviews]. the
enzyme catalyzes both the hydration of co* to
hzc03 and the reverse dehydration [l]. functionally,
this enzyme participates in ionic fluxes and acid-base
regulation [ 11.
mammals have three soluble isozyme forms of ca
which are distinct genetically and immunoiogic~ly.
one isozyme form, designated ca ii also known as
cao, is the predominate soluble form of the enzyme
and is present in blood. a deficiency of ca ii
may be related to metabolic disorders such as
osteopetrosis, cerebral calcification and renal tubular
acidosis [3,4]. a second form of the enzyme also
present in blood is ca i and is alternatively known
as cab. skeletal muscle is a source of a third type
of ca [s].
brain ca activity is present in both white and
gray matter and in the rodent shows a subcellular
distribution of 60% in membrane-bound
myelin and
40% in the soluble fraction [6]. ca is enriched lofold in glia compared to neurons [7] and has been
used as a marker for oligodendrocytes and astrocytes

(organon); and scopolamine and atropine (aldrich).
acetazolamide was custom tritiated (new england
nuclear) to a specific activity of 4.375 ci/mmol
(fig. 1). purified bovine  xxxg293xxx ,
ribonuclease
a, soybean  xxxd207xxx  and
trypsin tpck were obtained from worthington
biochemicals. crude carbonic anhydrase was derived
from animal cortical preparations or from cultured
cell types from the american
type culture
collection.
rat cortical ca preparation. for cortical carbonic
anhydrase preparations,
mature male spraguedawley rats (charles river, wilmington,
de)
weighing 250 g were decapitated and brains quickly
removed and rinsed in 0.32 m sucrose at 4”. the
olfactory bulbs were removed and the anterior
portion of the frontal cortex (approximately 350 mg
wet weight) was excised. the tissue was placed in
10~01. of either 50mm sodium phosphate buffer,
ph7.5,
or 20mm  xxxd3449xxx , ph8.0,
and
homogenized
using an ultra-turrax
tissumizer
(tekmar) at 50% power for 30sec at 4”. the
homogenate was then centrifuged at 100,ooog for
1 hr at 4” using an sw28 swinging bucket rotor in a
beckman model l8-80m ultracentrifuge. the soluble
and particulate fractions were either used fresh or
aliquoted and stored at -20” for later use. the
stored aliquots exhibited no measurable loss of
binding or enzyme activity from one freeze-thaw
cycle.
bulk isolation of rat brain cell types. adult rat
brain neurons, glia and oligodendrocytes were bulk
isolated by established procedures based upon
gradient centrifugation techniques [14,15].
cell culture. fetal murine glial cell cultures were
initiated from swiss-webster 15-day fetuses (charles
river, wilmington,
de) using established procedures [16]. transformed cell cultures were al72

human glioblastoma, rat hepatoma and c-6 glioma
cells from the american type culture collection.
all cell cultures were grown in dulbecco’s modified
eagle’s medium containing 4.5 g/l glucose and
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100
units/ml
penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin and
0.25 pg/ml  xxxd164xxx , and incubated at 37” in an
atmosphere of 5% coz/95% air. when flask
populations reached confluence, cells were harvested
by scraping with a teflon spatula into 0.32 m sucrose
at 4”. cells were centrifuged at 1500 g for 30 min
and the pellets were washed in 50mm sodium
phosphate buffer, ph 7.5, centrifuged at 1500 g and
resuspended in the same buffer. the cell suspensions
were then homogenized using an ultra-turrax
tissumizer at 50% power for 20 set and centrifuged
at 100,ooog for 1 hr. the resultant soluble and
particulate fractions were either used immediately
or aliquoted and stored at -20”.
enzyme activity measurements. ca activity was
assayed according to electrometric procedures [ 171.
briefly, the time (set) was measured in which added
enzyme lowers the ph of cor-saturated
water
(4 ml) and 20 mm  xxxd3449xxx  (6 ml), by 2.0 units,
from ph 8.0 to 6.0. all solutions and reagents were

binding of [3h]az to soluble ca. binding of
[3h]az to soluble ca enzyme preparations was
assessed using the following paradigm. supematant
protein (200 pg) was incubated at 22” for 30 min in
50 mm  xxxd3449xxx , ph 7.0, containing [3h]az in a
final volume of 5oopl. saturation isotherms were
conducted using varied radioligand concentrations
between 1 nm and 1 pm. non-specific binding
was determined
in the presence
of 100 ,um
 xxxd2592xxx . following incubation, the contents
of the assay tubes were applied to pharmacia pd10 columns (bed vol., 9.1 ml) which were preequilibrated by passage of 25 ml of 50 mm sodium
phosphate buffer, ph 7.5. the columns were eluted
with 4 ml of the equilibration buffer. the fractions
containing [3h]az bound to carbonic anhydrase
(mol wt = 30,ooodaltons) were collected in
scintillation vials, to which 5 ml of beckman readysolv cp scintillation fluid was added. radioactivity
was determined using a packard tri-carb 4640 liquid
scintillation spectrometer at 55% efficiency. specific
[3h]az bound to soluble ca was calculated by
subtracting values obtained for non-specific binding
from total binding. for competition studies, ca
inhibitors (at various concentrations)
or general
pharmacologic agents (at 100 pm) were included in
the incubation mixture, at a [3h]az concentration
of 50 nm.
binding of [3h]az to membrane ca. binding of
[3h]az to particulate fraction preparations was

[3h]acetazolamide binding to carbonic anhydrase
assessed using vacuum filtration techniques. briefly,
incubations (soo~l total volume) were conducted
as described above except that 125-500 pg of protein
from particulate preparation was added. following
a 30-min incubation at 22“, binding was terminated
by rapid filtration through whatman gf/b filters
(pre-soakedin 50 mm  xxxd3449xxx , ph 7.0, containing
0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx ) using a brandel m24r cell harvester, followed by four 5-ml buffer
washes. the filter disks were then placed into
scintillation vials to which 10 ml of beckman-readysolv hp scintillation fluid was added. the vials were
mixed by vortexing and radioactivity was determined
using liquid scintillation spectrometry. for [3h]az
displacement studies, the methodology as outlined
above was followed using the particulate
ca
preparations and [3h]az at 100 nm. displacing
agents were tested at the concentrations
stated
above.
binding specificity of [ 3h]az with other proteins.
the binding of [3h]az to other soluble proteins
was investigated. selected proteins (100 pg) were
incubated at 22” for 20 min with 100 nm [3h]az in
50 mm  xxxd3449xxx , ph 7.5.  xxxd2592xxx  (100 pm)
was added to parallel incubations to assess nonspecific binding. binding analysis was performed as
described above.
effect of protein concentration on [ 3h]az binding.
[ 3h]az binding to soluble and particulate rat cortical
preparations was performed across a varied protein
(so-500 pg) concentration range. incubations were
conducted at 22” for 20 min with 50 nm [3h]az for
soluble binding and 100 nm [3h]az for binding to
particulate preparations.  xxxd2592xxx  (100 pm)
was added to parallel incubations to assess nonspecific binding. analysis of binding to soluble and
particulate preparations was performed as described
above.
ph optima for [3h]az binding. the effect of ph
on [3h]az binding to rat cortical soluble and
particulate preparations
was examined. sodium
pyrophosphate (50mm) was used as the buffer for
ph ranges of 6.0 to 7.0 and 8.0 to 9.0. sodium
phosphate (50 mm) was used as the buffer salt from
ph 7.0 to 8.0. [3h]az was used at 50 nm for soluble
preparations while 100 nm [3h]az was employed
for particulate preparations. incubations and binding
analysis were performed as described above.
protein determination.
protein concentrations
were determined by the protein-dye binding method
of bradford
[18] in kit form from biorad
laboratories
(richmond,
ca) with bovine yglobulin as the standard.
curve fitting. [3h]az saturation isotherms and
displacement assays were analyzed by computerassisted programs (lundon i and lundon ii vax/
vms versions; lundon software, inc., cleveland,
oh).

discussion

carbonic anhydrase is an important enzyme for
the maintenance of cellular microenvironmental
ph

999

by participating in fluid and ion movement. the
present study characterizes the binding of [3h]az
to both soluble and membrane bound forms of
carbonic anhydrase. binding of [3h]az to the
particulate form of ca was accomplished through
conventional vacuum filtration methods, while a gel
permeation chromatography method was developed
to separate free ligand from enzyme-bound ligand
for soluble ca. radioligand binding to ca is a
sensitive assay for the detection of the enzyme and
is technically
simpler than immunological
or
electrometric techniques.
[3h]az binding to ca was specific, reversible
and saturable, demonstrating nanomolar affinity for
the enzyme. the labeling of ca by [3h]az appeared
specific for the enzyme since its binding was not
displaced by other classes of pharmacologic agents.
the pharmacological properties of ca derived from
different sources appeared homogeneous. the rank
order of potency for ca inhibitors was similar for
rat cortical particulate and soluble enzyme forms.
in rat cortex, binding of [3h]az to the soluble
preparation
was of higher affinity and lower
density compared to the particulate preparation.
trachtenberg and sapirstein [6] found that membrane
bound ca represents 63% of the total ca population
in cortical areas of rat brain measured by ph change
assay. in the present study, the crude rat cortical
particulate preparation represented 79% of the total
ca as measured by the binding of [3h]az.
therefore,
a reasonable
correlation
exists in
identifying ca activity in rat brain fractions either
by ph change assay or binding of t3h]az. when
bulk isolates of rat neurons or oligodendrocytes were
prepared, a striking difference was observed. in
neurons, 95% of the total ca was soluble whereas
in oligodendrocytes, 60% of the total was located in
the soluble fraction. this supports the hypothesis
that the different subcellular forms of ca may be
responsible for different cellular functions. coleman,
[12] performed [3h]az binding to purified human
carbonic anhydrase b which resulted in a total
binding of 33 nmol/mg protein with an optimal ph
for binding of 7.0. the present study agrees with the
ph optimum finding; however, [3h]az binding was
16,000 times less in a crude rat cortical particulate
preparation and 100 times less in purified bovine
 xxxg293xxx . the binding discrepancy could be due to the
purity and source of the enzyme as well as corrections
made for specific binding which was not performed
in the former study [12].
ca activity assays were performed on various
preparations to assess the activity of enzyme present
in each sample. rat cortical and cultured murine glial
cell preparations consistently exhibited measurable
ca activity. the lack of binding of [3h]az to human
glioblastoma, rat c-6 glioma and rat hepatoma cells
is rather unusual. however, a similar observation
was made using rat c-6 glioma and mouse
neuroblastoma cell lines employing a ph change
assay [9]. the possibility exists that the ca enzyme
molecule expressed in transformed cells is altered
from that in normal cells.
[3h]az is not selective or preferential for a specific
ca isozyme. thus, the binding of [3h]az is useful
as a probe for assessing all forms of ca in various

l. r. meyersonand d. nesta

normal and pathological tissues. az is a very
polar sulfonamide,
unlike the moderately polar
 xxxd2592xxx  or the very lipophilic  xxxd2058xxx .
the more hydrophobic sulfonamides due to their
increased lipophilicity have a greater potential to
cross the blood-brain barrier. one could exploit the
finding that in transformed cells [3h]az does not
bind to ca. thus, a gamma emitting form of
lipophilic  xxxd2058xxx  may prove useful in reverse
positron emission tomography imaging of ca in
brain tumors.
