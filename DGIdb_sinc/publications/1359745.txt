 xxxg147xxx  inhibitors for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.  the unique role of the enzyme  xxxg147xxx  ( xxxg147xxx ) in the production of leukotrienes (lts) makes it a likely target for biochemical manipulation. the rationale for using  xxxg147xxx  inhibitors for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is based on the increased generation of lts in the inflamed mucosa, ltb4 being the most potent chemotactic and chemokinetic metabolite of  xxxd208xxx . furthermore, conventional drugs, such as corticosteroids,  xxxd3255xxx , and 5- xxxd153xxx , inhibit lt production and specific  xxxg147xxx  inhibition accelerates healing in animal models of acute colitis. the compounds identified as  xxxg147xxx  inhibitors can be divided into antioxidants, substrate-analogous, and a large miscellaneous group of inhibitors, where hydroxamic acids are potent and more selective inhibitors of  xxxg147xxx . the benzothiophene hydroxyurea,  xxxd3554xxx , is the first selective  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor evaluated for the treatment of patients with ibd. an 800-mg oral dose of  xxxd3554xxx  was shown to reduce ltb4, but not  xxxd1903xxx , concentrations by 75-85% in rectal dialysates from patients with active ulcerative colitis. the clinical efficacy of  xxxd3554xxx  800 mg b.i.d. has also been tested in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in similar patients.  xxxd3554xxx  significantly improved the symptom scores and the histology score, but not the sigmoidoscopy score, compared to pretreatment conditions and with response to placebo, the beneficial effects being most pronounced in patients not receiving concomitant  xxxd3255xxx  treatment. the mean inhibition of ltb4 in the target tissue of inflammation was 70%. the proof that any putative  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor is blocking lt production is an important stage in assessing any such drug. the main disadvantage of existing new lt inhibitors relates to the high potency of lts, and unless a higher level of inhibition can be achieved, endogenous lts may still be present in sufficient amounts to produce their effects.
