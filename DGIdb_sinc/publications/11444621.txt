assessment of benzimidazole binding to individual recombinant tubulin isotypes from haemonchus contortus.  one a- and 2  xxxg2353xxx  isotypes (isotypes 1 and 2) from the parasitic nematode haemonchus contortus were artificially expressed in e. coli and purified to obtain tubulin that was capable of polymerizing into microtubules. binding of [14c] mebendazole (mbz), a benzimidazole compound, to each individual unpolymerized isotype and to microtubules polymerized from recombinant alpha- and  xxxg2353xxx  was assessed and kd and bmax values determined. mebendazole bound to the individual tubulin isotypes with a stoichiometry of 1:1. binding occurred with highest affinity to alpha-tubulin followed by  xxxg2353xxx  isotype 2 and  xxxg2353xxx  isotype 1 indicating that alpha-tubulin may play a role in benzimidazole binding to microtubules. upon polymerization of alpha- and  xxxg2353xxx  isotype 2 into microtubules the stoichiometry of binding increased to 2:1 (mebendazole : tubulin) while binding affinity remained the same. mebendazole binding to alpha/beta-isotype 1 microtubules remained unchanged following polymerization. the increase in the number of benzimidazole receptors on alpha/beta-isotype 2 microtubules suggests the formation of a new benzimidazole receptor upon polymerization.
