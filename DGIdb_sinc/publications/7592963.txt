voltage-gated l-type ca21 channels are a key element in the
excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac muscle. these channels are the molecular target for many drugs including the
clinically useful nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem. physiologically they represent one of the sites where b-adrenergic
stimulation regulates cardiac function. thus, understanding
the molecular structure of cardiac l-type ca21 channels, including their subunit composition and the structure-function

relationship of each subunit, is of fundamental importance.
biochemical purification of l-type ca21 channels from skeletal
muscle has revealed that, in this tissue, the ca21 channel
complex consists of five subunits (1), which are encoded in four
genes (2– 6). functional expression of a1 in cells lacking endogenous ca21 channel subunits has established that the a1 subunit is by itself able to form a functional channel (7), although
the activation kinetics of the channel formed by a1 alone is
abnormal. coexpression of the skeletal muscle b subunit normalizes the activation kinetics (8), suggesting that b is an
essential component of the skeletal muscle l-type channel.
definitive identification of the subunit composition of the
cardiac l-type ca21 channel has been hampered by the low
abundance of dihydropyridine binding sites in cardiac muscle.
biochemical studies have demonstrated the existence of a1, b,
and a2-d in heart (9 –12). this has been further confirmed by
molecular cloning approaches (3, 13–15). cardiac a1 and its
splice variants, collectively referred to as a1c (16), have been
studied extensively by expression in xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells. coexpression studies have suggested crucial
physiological roles for the b subunit in the functioning of the
cardiac ca21 channel as in the case of the skeletal muscle
channel. in these studies, various b subunits are found to
increase peak current, accelerate activation kinetics, and shift
the voltage dependence of activation to more hyperpolarized
potentials (15, 17–19). the mechanism by which b increases
current density is ascribed to a facilitated coupling between the
movement of voltage sensor and pore opening without affecting
the number of channels being expressed (20). b subunits have
also been found to facilitate dihydropyridine binding to the
channel by increasing the bmax of receptor sites or the affinity
for ligands (21, 22). in contrast, the effect of a2 on cardiac a1
has not been consistent, although stimulation of peak current
(13, 23) and changes in inactivation kinetics (17, 21) have been
reported. one problem in dealing with these variable effects is
that there have been no good criteria as to whether these
effects are required for the physiological function of the channel
or they are artifactual effects observed only in heterologous
expression systems. a similar confusion surrounds the role of
the skeletal muscle g, which is able to affect the cardiac isoforms of a1 (17, 18) although its expression has been detected
only in skeletal muscle (5, 6).
in this article, we describe an analysis of the functional
importance of cardiac ca21 channel subunits by characterizing
their effects on the ligand binding properties of the complex. by
transiently expressing a cardiac a1 in various combinations
with a cardiac b, a2d, and the skeletal muscle g in cos.m6
cells, we demonstrate that high affinity dihydropyridine bind-

cardiac l-type ca21 channels are multisubunit complexes composed of a1c, a2d, and b2 subunits. we tested
the roles of these subunits in forming a functional complex by characterizing the effects of subunit composition on dihydropyridine binding, its allosteric regulation, and the ability of dihydropyridines to inhibit
channel activity. transfection of cos.m6 cells with cardiac a1c-a (a1) led to the appearance of dihydropyridine
([3h]pn200-110) binding which was increased by coexpression of cardiac b2a (b), a2da (a2), and the skeletal
muscle g. maximum binding was achieved when cells
expressed a1, b, and a2. cells transfected with a1 and b
had a binding affinity that was 5–10-fold lower than that
observed in cardiac membranes. coexpression of a2 normalized this affinity. (2)- xxxd600xxx  and diltiazem both partially inhibited pn200-110 binding to cardiac microsomes, but stimulated binding in cells transfected with
a1 and b. again, coexpression of a2 normalized this allosteric regulation. therefore coexpression of a1b and
a2 completely reconstituted high affinity dihydropyridine binding and its allosteric regulation as observed in
cardiac membranes. skeletal muscle g was not required
for this reconstitution. expression in xenopus oocytes
demonstrated that coexpression of a2 with a1b increased the potency and maximum extent of block of
ca21 channel currents by  xxxd2734xxx , a dihydropyridine ca21 channel antagonist. our results demonstrate
that a2 subunits are essential components of the cardiac
l-type ca21 channel and predict a minimum subunit
composition of a1cb2a2d for this channel.

ing and its allosteric regulation are identical to those in cardiac
membranes only when a1, b, and a2d are expressed, and that
a2d plays a key role in the formation of cardiac l-type ca21
channel complex.
experimental procedures

by centrifugation for 10 min at 450 3 g at 4 °c. this fraction was
resuspended in 4 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 0.5 mm mgcl2 and 50
mm tris (ph 7.5) for dihydropyridine binding assays. protein concentration was determined by the lowry method.
preparation of microsomal membranes from cardiac muscle—microsomal membranes from rabbit cardiac muscle were prepared as described previously (27). the tissue was placed in ice-cold phosphatebuffered saline and minced with scissors, and then homogenized in 20
ml of 50 mm tris (ph 7.5) per gram of tissue using a polytron homogenizer. the homogenate was centrifuged at 3,000 3 g for 10 min at 4 °c.
the pellet was discarded and the supernatant was further centrifuged
at 45,000 3 g for 45 min. the pellet was suspended in ice-cold buffer
containing 0.5 mm mgcl2 and 50 mm tris (ph 7.5) for dihydropyridine
binding assays. protein concentration was determined by the method of
lowry.
(1)-[3h]pn200-110 binding assays—binding assays were carried
out in a final volume of 1 ml. reactions contained 50 mm tris (ph 7.5),
0.4 mm mgcl2, 100 –200 mg of membrane protein, and various concentrations of (1)-[3h]pn200-110 and other drugs. the concentration of
(1)-[3h]pn200-110 was 0.4 nm in single concentration assays and from
0.01 to 1 nm for saturation assays. nonspecific binding was determined
in the presence of 2.5 mm unlabeled  xxxd2737xxx . cacl2 was added to a
final concentration of 1 mm in assays with added ca21. incubations
were carried out for 90 min at room temperature (22–24 °c). the
reactions were terminated by filtration through whatman gf/b glass
fiber filters using a brandel cell harvester. the filters were washed four
times each with 5 ml of ice-cold 25 mm tris (ph 7.5) and were then
extracted in 5 ml of scintillation mixture for at least 2 h. radioactivity
was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry.
expression in xenopus oocytes and electrophysiological recordings—crnas for a1, b, and a2 were synthesized in vitro as described
previously (18) and suspended in water for injection. the final concentration for all crnas was 100 ng/ml. 50 nl of crna was injected per
oocyte using a drummond nanojet automatic oocyte injector. oocytes
were maintained at 19 °c on a rotating platform (20 rpm) in a medium
containing 100 mm nacl, 2 mm kcl, 1.8 mm cacl2, 1 mm mgcl2, 2.5 mm
 xxxd3055xxx , and 5 mm hepes (ph 7.6). either 50 mg/ml gentamicin or
100 units/ml penicillin plus 100 mg/ml streptomycin was added to the
medium. voltage clamp recording was performed approximately 7 days
after crna injection.
currents were recorded using the cut-open oocyte vaseline-gap voltage clamp technique (28) with a ca-1 amplifier from dagan corp. an
oocyte was placed in triple perspex chambers that isolated a portion
(approximately one-sixth to one-fifth) of the oocyte surface for current
recording. oocyte membrane exposed to the bottom compartment was
permeabilized by a brief treatment with 0.1% saponin to allow low
access resistance to the interior of the oocyte. the voltage pipettes, filled
with a solution containing 2.7 m sodium methanesulfonate, 10 mm
egta, and 10 mm nacl, had tip resistance of 300 to 400 kv. data
acquisition and analysis were performed using the pclamp system
(axon instruments). currents were induced by 250-ms depolarization
steps from a holding potential of 240 mv. linear components were
subtracted using p/24 protocol. current signals were filtered at 0.5 khz
and digitized at 2 khz.
all experiments were performed at room temperature (22–24 °c).
each oocyte was injected with 50 nl of 50 mm bapta(na)41 prior to
recording to minimize the contamination by the oocyte endogenous cl2
currents, which can be activated by the influx of ba21 as well as of ca21
(29). the external recording solution contained 10 mm ba21, 96 mm
na1, and 10 mm hepes, ph adjusted to 7.4 with  xxxd390xxx  acid.
the internal solution contained 120 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm
egta, and 10 mm hepes, ph adjusted to 7.3 with koh.  xxxd2734xxx 
was diluted in the external solution so that 5% of the top chamber
volume was replaced to achieve the desired final concentration. before
an oocyte was subjected to  xxxd2734xxx , it was observed for 10 –15 min
with repeated stimulation to ensure a stable current amplitude. under
our conditions, currents usually remained stable for at least 1 h. rundown occurred only in oocytes which were severely damaged and these
oocytes were discarded. in order to obtain cumulative dose-response
relationships for  xxxd2734xxx , an oocyte was stimulated by a 250-ms
depolarization step to 110 mv repeated every 10 s. a higher drug
concentration was applied after the response to the previous concentration stabilized, usually within 20 s.

complementary dnas and other materials—for transfection of
cos.m6 cells, the cdna encoding a rabbit cardiac ca21 channel a1c-a
subunit (18) was cloned into the expression plasmid pknh. pknh and
its derivative pkcr-a2d containing the rabbit skeletal muscle a2da
cdna (fnudii(25)/ecori(13544) fragment) were gifts from dr. tsutomu tanabe (yale university). the b subunit cdna encoded the rat
b2a isoform (14, 15). it was subcloned into the expression plasmid
p91203(b), which was a gift from dr. randall kaufman (genetics institute, cambridge, ma). the expression plasmid pskmcachg.3 containing the rabbit skeletal muscle g cdna (5) was a gift from dr. kevin
campbell (university of iowa). all dnas used for transfection were
prepared by the cscl gradient centrifugation method. the a1c-a used for
expression in xenopus oocytes was dn60, which is an n-terminal deletion mutant of the rabbit cardiac a1c-a (24). b2 and a2d were subcloned
into pbluescript and pgem-3, respectively. t7 rna polymerase was
used for in vitro synthesis of crnas. in this report we will refer to the
cardiac a1c-a clones as a1, b2a as b, and a2d as a2.

specific
activity 80 – 85 ci/mmol, was purchased from amersham.  xxxd2734xxx 
was a kind gift from dr. david j. triggle (state university of new york
at buffalo).  xxxd2737xxx , (2)- xxxd600xxx , and diltiazem were purchased from
calbiochem. tissue culture media and sera were purchased from brl/
life technologies, inc. nuserum was purchased from collaborative
research (bedford, ma). t7 rna polymerase and other chemicals for in
vitro transcription were obtained from boehringer mannheim.
culture and transfection of cos.m6 cells—cos.m6 cells were
grown in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium with high glucose. the
medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml
penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. cells were transfected using a
deae-dextran method described by luthman and magnusson (25)
with modifications. briefly, 1 day before transfection, cells were plated
at a density of 2 3 106 cells/100-mm dish. at the time of transfection,
cells were washed twice with 10 ml of hank’s  xxxd2988xxx  and
overlaid with 4 ml of a solution containing 25 mm tris (ph 7.5), 137 mm
nacl, 5.1 mm kcl, 1.4 mm na2hpo4, 1.3 mm cacl2, 1.0 mm mgcl2, 10%
nuserum (collaborative research), 144 mg/ml deae-dextran, and
plasmid dna. a1 dna was used at 1 mg/100-mm dish, and all other
dnas were used at 2 mg/dish. cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °c in
an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% co2. after the incubation, the dna
containing solution was removed and cells incubated first with 5 ml of
10%  xxxd1896xxx  in hank’s  xxxd2988xxx  for 2 min at
room temperature, and then with 10 ml of dulbecco’s modified eagle’s
medium with high glucose, 2% fetal bovine serum, and 100 mm chloroquine for 3– 4 h at 37 °c. thereafter, the chloroquine containing medium was discarded and the cells were first washed twice with hank’s
 xxxd2988xxx , and then overlaid with 10 ml of dulbecco’s
modified eagle’s medium with high glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum
and incubated at 37 °c for 60 h.
the transfection efficiency of this procedure was tested by transfecting cells with 2 mg of the psv-bgal indicator plasmid and testing cells
histochemically for the functional expression of b-galactosidase as described by macgregor et al. (26). briefly, 60 h after transfection, the
cells in a 100-mm dish were rinsed with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered
saline, and overlaid with 1 ml of 0.6% glutaraldehyde in phosphatebuffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. the cells were then
rinsed twice with 10 ml of 50 mm tris (ph 7.5) and 150 mm nacl (tbs)
and overlaid with 8 ml of tbs containing 0.5 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro3-indoyl a-d-galactoside, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium
ferricyanide, and 2 mm mgcl2. after an overnight incubation at 37 °c,
the proportion of cells developing blue color due to b-galactosidase
expression was determined with a phase-contrast microscope at a magnification of 200 3. the transfection efficiency thus tested was between
30 and 40%.
preparation of crude membranes from transfected cos.m6 cells—
approximately 60 h after transfection, cos.m6 cells were rinsed with
ice-cold tbs, and harvested in 20 ml of ice-cold tbs using a rubber
policeman. the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 450 3 g for 5
min at 4 °c. cells from one 100-mm dish were resuspended in 5 ml of 50
mm tris (ph 7.5) and 1 mm edta and lysed by repeated vigorous
vortexing over 20 min. the crude particulate fraction was then pelleted

due to an increase in the number of receptors. in order to
investigate these possibilities, (1)-[3h]pn200-110 binding was
measured at various concentrations of the ligand and scatchard analyses were performed. cos cells expressing a1 alone,
a1 with a2 and/or g but without b had amounts of pn200-110
binding that were too low to allow for scatchard analysis.
therefore binding in cells expressing a1b was used to determine the effects of other subunits. binding to cardiac microsomal membranes was carried out in parallel as control. binding
was also compared in the absence and presence of 1 mm added
ca21 in all membrane preparations to determine the dependence on divalent cations. all data represent the average from
three to four experiments each performed in duplicate.
[3h]pn200-110 binding to rabbit cardiac microsomal membranes had a kd of 38 6 4 pm (n 5 3) and 33 6 6 pm (n 5 3) in
the presence and absence of ca21, respectively. the bmax values were 213 6 14 and 176 6 11 fmol/mg of protein in the
presence and absence of ca21, respectively (table i). the kd
values obtained in the present study were similar to those
reported previously for cardiac myocytes (27). the results demonstrated that high affinity dihydropyridine binding to cardiac
membranes did not require added ca21. in contrast, pn200110 binding to membranes from cos cells expressing a1b was
different in two ways. first, in the presence of ca21, the kd of
a1b expressing cells was 175 6 11 pm; this reflects a 5-fold
lower affinity than that in cardiac membranes. second, the
affinity was still lower in the absence of added ca21. both of
these differences suggest that additional subunits may be required to reconstitute the high affinity dihydropyridine binding
seen in cardiac membranes.
fig. 2 shows representative scatchard plots of binding in the
presence of ca21 in cos cells expressing either a1b, a1ba2,
a1bg, or a1ba2g. in the presence of ca21, coexpression of a2, g,
or both with a1b increased the affinity of pn200-110 binding in
comparison with cells expressing a1b only. the kd values (table i) were very similar to that in cardiac microsomal membranes. however, in the absence of added ca21 only in cells
expressing a1ba2 and a1ba2g, the affinity of pn200-110 resembled that in cardiac membranes. binding affinity in cells expressing a1bg was 6.5-fold lower than that in cardiac membranes. thus, coexpression of g with a1b failed to correct the
divalent cation dependence, although it restored the affinity of
pn200-110 binding in the presence of ca21. the bmax in a1b
expressing cells was close to that in cardiac membranes and
was not altered by the coexpression of a2 or a2g (table i).
however, bmax was lower in cells expressing a1bg both in the
absence and presence of ca21 (table i). that transient expression of ca21 channel subunits in cos cells led to receptor
densities close to that in cardiac muscle demonstrates that
cos cells are suitable for studying ligand binding to ca21

effects of subunit combination on (1)-[3h]pn200-110 binding—cos cells were transfected with a1 alone or with b, a2,
and skeletal muscle g plasmids in various combinations. dihydropyridine binding was tested at 0.4 nm (1)-[3h]pn200-110.
in preliminary experiments with a1 alone, maximum binding
was achieved when 4 mg of plasmid dna was transfected per
100-mm dish. binding was approximately half-maximal at 1 mg
of a1 dna/dish. the effects of b, a2, or g were clearly detectable
when 2 mg each of the plasmids were co-transfected with a1,
and the effects did not increase further when the amount of
plasmid dna was 5 mg. therefore in all the experiments, the
amounts of plasmid dna were 1 mg for a1 and 2 mg for all other
subunits. using submaximal amounts of a1 and saturating
amounts of other subunits would minimize the potential formation of heterogeneous populations of complexes. transfection of cos cells with b, a2, and g without a1 did not lead to the
appearance of dihydropyridine binding (data not shown).
fig. 1 shows (1)-[3h]pn200-110 binding to membranes from
cos cells transfected with various combinations of subunits.
the results represent the average from four experiments. cells
transfected with a1 only had a measurable binding of 3.8 6 1.5
fmol/mg of protein. thus, the level of binding achieved in cells
transfected with a1 alone was very low and close to the limit of
detection. coexpression of a1 with b, a2, or g increased the
amount of (1)-[3h]pn200-110 binding. the most effective subunit was b, which stimulated binding 19-fold. in comparison, a2
stimulated binding only 4.4-fold. g appeared to have a small
effect (an 1.5-fold increase) although this effect may not be
significant due to the sensitivity of the binding assay. cotransfection of a1 with combinations of b, a2, and g revealed
interesting properties in terms of the effects of these subunits
in stimulating binding. first, maximum pn200-110 binding
was obtained when a1, b, and a2 were coexpressed; binding
reached 165.4 6 8.0 fmol/mg of protein which represents a
44-fold stimulation. this degree of stimulation by b and a2
together is much greater than predicted by the sum of the
effects of each subunit alone, suggesting that b and a2 functioned synergistically. second, coexpression of a1 with b and g
stimulated binding by 19-fold, coexpression with a2g stimulated binding by 5.8-fold, and coexpression with ba2g stimulated binding by 39-fold. these results suggest that g did not
have a significant effect on dihydropyridine binding when either b or a2 or both were coexpressed with a1.
the stimulation of dihydropyridine binding to a1 by other
subunits may be due to an increase in the affinity for ligand or

subunit are illustrated in the figure. binding assays were carried out
using 0.4 nm (1)-[3h]pn200-110, in the presence of 0.4 mm mg21 and in
the absence of added ca21. data are normalized against the binding in
the absence of (2)- xxxd600xxx . control binding was 6.4 6 2.1 fmol/mg of
protein in cos cells with a1b, 74.7 6 21.2 fmol/mg of protein in a1ba2,
9.8 6 2.2 fmol/mg of protein in a1bg, 76.9 6 36.1 fmol/mg of protein in
a1ba2g, and 126.8 6 23.6 fmol/mg in cardiac muscle. these values were
lower than those in fig. 1 because binding assays in the present figure
were performed in the absence of added ca21. data are mean 6 s.e.,
n 5 4.

presence of added ca21. diltiazem has been reported to increase, decrease, or have no effect on dihydropyridine binding.
its effect is dependent on factors such as temperature, divalent
cations, and membrane potential. it is thus important to define
carefully the experimental conditions under which diltiazem
affects dihydropyridine binding. in the present study, diltiazem was tested in binding assays performed at room temperature (22–24 °c), in the presence of 0.4 mm mg21, 1 mm ca21,
and 0.4 nm [3h]pn200-110. under these conditions, diltiazem
had a slight inhibitory effect on pn200-110 binding to cardiac
microsomal membranes; the maximum inhibition was less
than 15% (fig. 4). however, in cos cells expressing a1b, diltiazem stimulated pn200-110 binding in a concentration-dependent manner. binding was 270% of control in the presence
of 30 mm diltiazem. this discrepancy in the effects of diltiazem
between cardiac muscle and cos cells expressing a1b is similar
although not identical to that observed with the effects of
(2)- xxxd600xxx . coexpression of a2, g, or both, eliminated this discrepancy. as shown in fig. 4, diltiazem slightly inhibited
pn200-110 binding in cos cells transfected with a1ba2, a1bg,
or a1ba2g; the concentration-response relationships in these
cells were very similar to that in cardiac membranes.
inhibition of ca21 channel currents by  xxxd2734xxx  and its
modulation by a2—our binding results indicated that a1b had
a lower affinity for dihydropyridine ca21 channel antagonists
than a1ba2. to determine if subunit composition altered the
pharmacological sensitivity of ca21 channel currents, we
tested the ability of  xxxd2734xxx  to inhibit currents from xenopus oocytes expressing a1b and a1ba2. currents were recorded
using the cut-open oocyte voltage clamp technique in 10 mm
ba21. oocytes were held at 240 mv and stimulated by repeated depolarization to 110 mv for 250 ms.  xxxd2734xxx  was
added cumulatively and inhibited currents in oocytes injected
with a1b and a1ba2 (fig. 5a). the cumulative dose-response
curves for  xxxd2734xxx  are shown in fig. 5b, which indicates
that  xxxd2734xxx  was more potent in oocytes injected with a1ba2
than in those with a1b. for example at 0.1 nm,  xxxd2734xxx 
inhibited 23% of the currents from oocytes injected with a1ba2,

channels. these results indicate that the complex formed by
a1ba2 is the minimum subunit structure which qualitatively
resembles native cardiac ca21 channels in terms of dihydropyridine binding.
effects of subunits on allosteric regulation of dihydropyridine binding—(2)- xxxd600xxx  and diltiazem are allosteric regulators
of dihydropyridine binding (30, 31). the regulatory effects of
(2)- xxxd600xxx  and diltiazem are thought to be coupled to or mediated by ca21 binding sites in l-type ca21 channels (32, 33). in
previous studies, we demonstrated that the effect of (2)- xxxd600xxx 
differed in skeletal muscle and in cells expressing the skeletal
muscle a1 subunit (34). in the present study we tested the
effect of (2)- xxxd600xxx  on binding of [3h]pn200-110 (0.4 nm) to
membranes from transfected cos cells in the absence of added
ca21 and investigated how the (2)- xxxd600xxx  effect was modulated
by the subunit composition. in cardiac microsomal membranes,
(2)- xxxd600xxx  partially inhibited binding of pn200-110 in a concentration-dependent manner (fig. 3); the maximum extent of
inhibition was 46%. in contrast, (2)- xxxd600xxx  significantly enhanced pn200-110 binding at all concentrations tested in cos
cells expressing a1b (fig. 3). the stimulatory effect of (2)- xxxd600xxx 
was observed clearly at 3 nm, and reached maximum at 1 mm
where pn200-110 binding was stimulated 3-fold. the doseresponse relationship of (2)- xxxd600xxx  was biphasic, with less stimulatory effect observed at concentrations greater than 3 mm.
therefore, the allosteric regulation of dihydropyridine binding
by (2)- xxxd600xxx  was opposite in membranes from cardiac muscle
and from cos cells expressing the a1 and b subunits of cardiac
l-type ca21 channels.
coexpression of g subunit with a1b markedly attenuated the
stimulatory effect of (2)- xxxd600xxx  (fig. 3). at concentrations between 3 and 100 nm, (2)- xxxd600xxx  had a slight inhibitory effect on
pn200-110 binding, which was similar to the response obtained in cardiac membranes. however, at concentrations
above 1 mm, (2)- xxxd600xxx  stimulated pn200 binding with the maximum stimulation of approximately 55% observed at 30 mm. in
contrast, when a2 was coexpressed with a1b, (2)- xxxd600xxx  partially inhibited pn200-110 binding to cos cells in exactly the
same manner as in cardiac microsomal membrane, as illustrated in fig. 3. coexpression of g with a1b2a2 did not cause a
further change in the allosteric effect of (2)- xxxd600xxx . these results once again suggest that the complex of a1ba2 is the
minimum combination of subunits that resemble cardiac ca21
channels in dihydropyridine binding.
the effect of diltiazem was tested using similar assays in the

xenopus oocytes and currents recorded in 10 mm ba21 using the cutopen oocyte voltage clamp technique. a, currents induced by repeated
depolarization to 110 mv from 240 mv holding potential in oocytes
injected with a1b and a1ba2.  xxxd2734xxx  was added in a cumulative
manner to the bath (the top chamber). the lower-case letters beside the
traces indicate currents in the absence (a) and presence of 0.1 nm (b), 10
nm (c), 1 mm (d), and 30 mm (e)  xxxd2734xxx . b, cumulative dose-response

0.084 mm in oocytes injected with a1b and a1ba2, respectively.
this represents a 26-fold shift in the half-maximum concentration for inhibition. at the maximum concentration tested (30
mm),  xxxd2734xxx  inhibited 66 and 81% of currents in oocytes
injected with a1b and a1ba2, respectively.
current-voltage relationships in the presence and absence of
 xxxd2734xxx  are shown in fig. 6.  xxxd2734xxx  inhibited currents
at all potentials tested. it inhibited peak currents to a greater
extent in oocytes injected with a1ba2 (fig. 6b) than in oocytes
injected with a1b (fig. 6a). the position and shape of the
current-voltage relationships were not modified by  xxxd2734xxx .
the percentage of inhibition by  xxxd2734xxx  at potentials where
inward currents can be reliably measured is plotted as a function of membrane potential in fig. 6c. thus, when the membrane was depolarized to potentials ranging from 230 to 130

mv, currents were inhibited by approximately 70% in oocytes
injected with a1b and by approximately 80% in those with
a1ba2. the relative effectiveness of  xxxd2734xxx  was not affected
by the amplitude of the step pulse.
discussion

cloning and functional expression of cardiac and several
other l-type ca21 channel a1 subunits have firmly established
that a1 is by itself sufficient to form the voltage-gated ionconducting pore and that a1 has the receptor sites for all major
chemical classes of ligands, such as dihydropyridines, phenylalkylamines, and benzothiazepines (7, 13, 23, 35). it has also
been generally accepted that the b subunit is an essential
component of ca21 channels, including the cardiac l-type
channel, since b has consistently been observed to modulate
significantly the biophysical characteristics of a1 (8, 15, 17–19).
however, the functional role of a2 in cardiac l-type ca21 channels has not been clearly defined, although its presence in
cardiac muscle has been demonstrated by biochemical and
molecular means (3, 36, 37). the most consistent effect of a2
has been an approximately 2-fold increase in current density
over a1 alone when expressed in oocytes (13, 23), although
effects on channel inactivation have been reported (17, 21). due
to the lack of measurable criteria, it is difficult to conclude
whether these effects of a2 are necessary for normal channel
function.
in the present study, we examined the role of subunits,
particularly a2, on the ligand binding properties of expressed
cardiac l-type ca21 channel in two systems: transient expression in cos.m6 cells in which dihydropyridine binding and its
allosteric regulation by ca21, (2)- xxxd600xxx , and diltiazem were
studied, and expression in xenopus oocytes where the sensitivity of ca21 channel currents to an antagonist  xxxd2734xxx  was
examined. our results demonstrate for the first time that a2 is
essential for the reconstitution of both high affinity dihydropyridine binding and its allosteric regulation. thus the ca21
channel complex formed by a1b, in comparison to that in cardiac membranes, has several defects: 1) its affinity for pn200110 was severalfold lower; 2) its affinity was dependent on
added ca21; and 3) its allosteric regulation by (2)- xxxd600xxx  and
diltiazem is abnormal. coexpression of a2 corrected all the
defects associated with a1b. furthermore, consistent with the
finding that a2 increased the affinity of ca21 channel for antagonists, coexpression of a2 with a1b in oocytes greatly increased the potency of the antagonist  xxxd2734xxx  in blocking
ca21 channel currents. these results clearly demonstrate that
a2 is an essential functional component of the cardiac l-type
ca21 channel, and that a1ba2 is the minimum subunit combination of a complex that has pharmacological properties iden-

tical to those of the native cardiac l-type ca channel. lack of
a2 in the complex may cause conformational changes that are
not readily detected by analyzing its biophysical properties, but
that substantially alter its ligand binding ability.
in analyzing the effect of each subunit on ligand binding to
a1, we found that the cardiac b (b2) alone stimulated pn200110 binding by 19-fold. the mechanism of this stimulation was
not examined in this study. by expression in chinese hamster
ovary cells, a skeletal b subunit, b1, and another widely expressed b, b3, increased the bmax of pn200-110 binding to a1
without an effect on affinity (21, 38). in these studies the kd of
pn200-110 was between 130 and 150 pm, similar to that in a1b
expressing cos cells in the present study. the increase in bmax
may suggest an increase in ca21 channel expression. however,
such a conclusion would be contradicted by the observation
that b did not increase the amount of a1 protein detected on
immunoblots (22, 39). in contrast, mitterdorfer et al. (22) reported that b1 increased 35-fold the affinity of pn200-110 to a
modified cardiac a1 due to a decrease in the rate the dissociation (22). the discrepancy may be explained by a shift from a
low affinity state (fast koff) to a high affinity state (slow koff), if
the lower affinity state cannot be readily detected, thus leading
to an apparent increase in bmax.
the present study clearly indicates that the skeletal muscle
g was capable of interacting with cardiac a1b. in the study g
showed three effects on dihydropyridine binding to cells expressing a1b: it increased binding to a1b by increasing affinity
both in the presence and in the absence of ca21, it attenuated
the stimulatory effect of (2)- xxxd600xxx , and it completely eliminated
the stimulatory effect of diltiazem. however, g failed to correct
the divalent cation dependence of dihydropyridine binding and
it did not correct the anomalous effect of (2)- xxxd600xxx . the effect of
g was relatively small compared to those of b and a2, and when
a1 was coexpressed with b and a2, g had no additional effect. it
appears that g is not necessary for the formation of a complex
that resembles the cardiac ca21 channel in terms of ligand
binding properties. thus, demonstration that g interacts with
the cardiac a1b (or a1) in this and previous studies (17, 18) is
not sufficient evidence for the existence of a cardiac homolog of
the g subunit. the ability of g to interact with cardiac a1b is not
surprising given that skeletal muscle a1 and cardiac a1 share a
high degree of sequence homology (2, 13).
the present study demonstrates that by expressing the
cloned a1c, b2, and a2d in cos cells, a ca21 channel complex is
obtained that had ligand binding affinity and allosteric regulation identical to those in cardiac membranes. the density of
dihydropyridine receptors obtained in this transient expression
system was also close to that in cardiac membranes. our results suggest that transient expression of ca21 channels in
cos cells provides a useful model for studying the functional,
particularly the pharmacological, properties of ca21 channels
and the underlying structural basis for ca21 channel function.
to date six a1 genes have been cloned as recently reviewed by
perez-reyes and schneider (40). attempts to correlate these
cloned a1 subunits with endogenous ca21 channel types have
relied on the expression of these clones followed by electrophysiological and pharmacological characterization. discrepancies between the potency of v-agatoxin-iva and v-conotoxinmviic to block p-type currents in cerebellar purkinje neurons
and a1a-induced currents have led to the suggestion that a1a
does not encode the p-type current (41). the present study
indicates a vital role of subunit composition in determining the
pharmacological properties of a cloned channel. numerous
studies have also shown that subunit composition can alter the
