mg/kg, including aspirin, ibuprofen, indomethacin,
and picroxicam, attenuated by 29%-46% the duration of
loss of righting reflex induced by diazepam (20 mg/kg)
in mice. on the other hand,  xxxd208xxx  (20 mg/
kg) increased the duration of diazepam-induced loss of
righting reflex by 48%. this effect of  xxxd208xxx 
was abolished by aspirin. however, aspirin  xxxd1891xxx

rostaglandins (pg) are members of the eicosanoid family derived mainly from arachidonic
acid by the action of cyclooxygenase (cox),
which produces prostaglandin h2 (pgh2), which is
then transformed by a range of specific enzymes into
the primary prostanoids such as  xxxd14xxx 
( xxxg1073xxx ) and e2 (pge2). there are two isoforms of cox:
cox-1 is constitutive and predominant in most tissues
whereas cox-2 is inducible and tightly regulated at
transcription/translation levels.
 xxxd102xxx induced loss of righting reflex (lorr) in
mice was significantly decreased by cox inhibitors or
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids) such
as aspirin, indomethacin,  xxxd2556xxx  acid, and  xxxd2122xxx  (1). in addition, prostanoids could enhance
the sedative effects of ethanol (2). endogenous pg
levels were increased by ethanol to a larger extent in
ls mice (“long sleep” mice sensitive to ethanol) than
in ss mice (“short sleep” mice insensitive to ethanol)
(3). therefore, these observations indicate that ethanol, at least in part, mediates its central nervous system (cns) depressant effects by increasing the production of pgs. however, similar results were not

mg/kg also did not alter the effects of diazepam (5 mg/
kg) on spontaneous activity and rotarod performance.
these findings strongly suggest that one or more cox
products, most likely prostaglandins, play a significant
role in modulating the hypnotic effect of diazepam.
elucidating the mechanism involved may further our
understanding of the pharmacology of benzodiazepines.

obtained for other anesthetic drugs such as pentobarbital and chloral hydrate (1).
the benzodiazepines are the most widely used cns
depressant drugs. they act specifically on the benzodiazepine receptor of the gamma- xxxd2177xxx 
(gaba)a receptor complex and thus modify the
gaba-induced chloride flux. however, it has been
demonstrated that muscimol, a selective gabaa receptor agonist, stimulates glioma c6 cells to release
 xxxd208xxx , which is converted to  xxxg1073xxx  in the
presence of diazepam (4).  xxxg1073xxx  is an endogenous
sleep promoting substance (5). it is interesting, therefore, to investigate whether pgs play a role in the cns
depressant effects of diazepam. we report here that
cox-1 inhibitors decreased whereas  xxxd208xxx 
increased diazepam-induced lorr in mice.

methods
this work was approved by the animal ethics committee of national university of singapore and all
efforts were made to minimize the number of mice
used. male swiss-albino mice (25 to 30 g) were obtained from the laboratory animal center and
housed in groups of 5 with food and water available
ad libitum on a 12-h light-dark cycle. mice were assigned to experimental groups at random and each
was used in only one experiment.
all drugs were administered by intraperitoneal (ip)
injection with an injection volume of 5 ml/kg. aspirin,  xxxd208xxx  and small-dose diazepam were

dissolved in 30%  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso). all
other drugs were dissolved in dmso. control mice
received the appropriate vehicle only. diazepam was
administered 30 min after pretreatment.
after the administration of diazepam (20 mg/kg),
mice were put on their backs to test for lorr. the
righting reflex was considered lost if the mice could
not right themselves within 1 min, and regained when
they managed to right themselves 3 times within 1
min. the duration of lorr was recorded for each
mouse. all experiments were conducted between 1000
and 1200 h.
mice were screened 24 h before experimentation for
their ability to stay on a rotarod (acceler rota-rod,
ugo basile, comerio, italy), which accelerated from 2
to 20 revolutions/min in 5 min. only mice that could
stay on for the full 5 min were used in the experiment.
after the administration of diazepam (5 mg/kg), mice
were put into an activity cage. spontaneous ambulation was monitored for 3 min after a delay of 1 min.
the activity cage (columbus instruments, columbus,
oh) consisted of a transparent polypropylene box of
dimension 40 (l) ⫻ 20 (w) ⫻ 20 (h) cm. the movement
of a mouse inside the box was monitored by 15 infrared beams placed equidistant, and the distance between the first and the last beam was 38 cm. beam
interceptions were recorded automatically by a
computer-based system. ambulatory activities were
recorded at 30-s time blocks. three min after the completion of the activity cage measurements, the mouse
was then placed onto the rotarod and the fall latency
was recorded; otherwise, the mouse was given a latency of 5 min. all experiments were conducted between 1900 and 2300 h.
mice were given an ip injection (4 ml/kg) of either
saline (control) or diazepam (20 mg/kg). they were
killed by cervical dislocation 30 min after the injection.
cerebral cortex and hypothalamus/thalamus were
collected and homogenized (heidolph diax 900
homogenizer, heidolph instruments llc, cinnaminson, nj) in ice-cold phosphate buffer containing
10 ␮m indomethacin. the homogenates were then
centrifuged at 15,000 rpm and the supernatant was
removed and stored at ⫺20°c until the pg assay.
indomethacin inhibits both cox enzymes and 15hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase that catalyzes
the catabolism of pg and was added to minimize
errors resulting from the possible synthesis and degradation of pg in the homogenate. the concentration
of  xxxg1073xxx  was determined using commercial kits according to manufacturer protocol (cayman chemical,
ann arbor, mi). the pge2 kits commercially available
use anti-mouse igg. to minimize possible crossreaction, a modified pge2 methoxime enzyme immunoassay kit was used with reagents purchased from
cayman.

mice were treated as described in the previous section. total rna was extracted from the cerebral cortex
using trizol reagent. rna concentration and purity
were assessed by measuring the absorbance at 260 and
280 nm wavelength (shimadzu uv-1601 uv-visible
spectrophotometer shimadzu corp., tokyo, japan).
only rna with absorbance ratio between 1.8 and 2.0
was used for further reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction (rt-pcr) analysis.
aliquots of total rna (5 ␮g) were used in the rt
reaction mixed with 0.5 ␮g oligo(dt) primer. firststrand cdna synthesis was then performed with the
use of avian myeloblastosis virus rt (invitrogen,
carlsbad, ca). cdna was then amplified by pcr
using primers specific to the key enzymes in pg synthesis pathway. ␤-actin, a ubiquitously expressed
gene, was used as an internal control. the specificity
of each pair of primers was tested by blasting their
sequences to the entire mice genome. the quality of
the primers was tested by the software, netprimer
(shimadzu).
␤-actin primers were as follows: forward, 5=-atctggcaccacaccttctacaatgagctgcg-3=; reverse: 5=-tactcctgcttgctgatccacatctgc3=, which yield a pcr product of 832bp. cox-1 primers
were as follows: forward, 5=-aggagatggctgctgagttgg-3=; reverse: 5=-aatctgactttctgagttgcc-3=, which result in a pcr product of 601bp.
lipocalin type-pgd synthase (l- xxxg1073xxx ) primers
were as follows: forward, 5=-caggaaaaaccagtgtgagacc-3=; reverse, 5=-agagggtggccatgcggaag-3=, which yield a pcr product of 194bp.
membrane-associated pge synthase-1 ( xxxg1876xxx )
primers were as follows: forward, 5=-tgtacgcggtggctgtcatc-3=;
reverse,
5=-gccaggacataggccccgg-3=, which result in a pcr product of
319bp. 2 ␮l from each rt reaction mixture was mixed
with 1 ␮l of each primer (20 mm), 25 ␮l pcr reaction
mix and the final volume was topped up to 50 ␮l. to
remain in the linear range during amplification, the
mixture was heated at 95°c for 5 min and the reaction
was performed respectively as follows: 29 cycles (95°c
for 30 s; 60°c for 30 secs and 72°c for 1 min; 10 min for
the last extension) for ␤-actin; 30 cycles (95°c for 30 s;
55°c for 30 s; and 72°c for 1 min; 10 min for the last
extension) for cox-1, 29 cycles (95°c for 30 s; 60°c for
30 s; and 72°c for 1 min; 10 min for the last extension)

 xxxg1876xxx . the amplified pcr products were then separated by electrophoresis (bio-rad laboratories, hercules, ca) on 1% agarose gel. a gene ruler 1000-bp
dna ladder was used to determine the size of the
pcr products. densitometry of the bands was performed (syngene multi genius bioimaging system,
frederick, md) to give rough quantifications. the expression level of each gene was estimated as its ratio to

discussion
in preliminary dose-finding experiments, it was found
that diazepam at 20 mg/kg gave consistent mean
duration of lorr (90 –120 min). this is appropriate
for studying a potential reduction of effect by cox
inhibitors. with smaller doses, there were a significant
number of mice that failed to show lorr. this would
cause large variations in the duration of lorr making
statistical comparison between groups difficult. the
human equivalent dose (hed) of 20 mg/kg in mice is
1.62 mg/kg calculated on the basis of body surface
area, or approximately 113 mg for a 70-kg person. this
is thus a very large dose compared with the usual
clinical doses (2–10 mg) being used in patients. however, this is consistent with the reported 95% effective
dose of propofol at 200 mg/kg (hed 16.2 mg/kg) for
inducing lorr in mice (8), whereas its clinical dose
range is 1–2.5 mg/kg in humans. at 5 mg/kg, diazepam gave a suitable reduction in locomotion and rotarod performance for the purpose of this study. dosages of 1–10 mg/kg are commonly used as motor
impairing or sedative doses in mice (9).
it is well established that the benzodiazepines cause
cns depression by acting on the benzodiazepine receptors that are regulatory sites on the gabaa receptors. when diazepam binds to this site, it enhances
gaba action on this receptor, leading to increased
opening frequency of the receptor chloride channel
and thus hyperpolarization of the neuronal membrane. the effects of the benzodiazepines are thus
limited by the action of endogenous gaba, and they
are not known to produce nonspecific effects related
to its lipid solubility even at very large doses (10). it is
therefore intriguing that  xxxd208xxx  could enhance, while cox inhibitors could attenuate, the hypnotic effect of diazepam. this is consistent with previous findings that pg synthesis inhibitors attenuated
 xxxd102xxx induced lorr (11) whereas  xxxg1073xxx  enhanced
pentobarbital-induced lorr (12).
although these findings clearly suggest that the
 xxxd208xxx  cascade can modulate the hypnotic
effect of diazepam, the mechanism is unclear. our
present findings strongly suggest that one or more
cox products, most likely pg, play a significant role
in modulating the duration of lorr. the fact that the
selective cox-2 inhibitor ns398 was ineffective, while
the cox-1 selective inhibitor, valeryl salicylate, and
all the nonselective inhibitors tested were effective,
demonstrated the exclusive involvement of the constitutive cox-1 and not the inducible cox-2 enzyme. it
is also interesting to note that aspirin did not alter the
effect of small-dose diazepam on spontaneous ambulation and rotarod performance. this argues against
any direct antagonistic action between aspirin and
diazepam because the same aspirin dose attenuated
the lorr induced by diazepam at a 20 mg/kg dose

but not the spontaneous activity and rotarod performance at a 5 mg/kg dose.
 xxxg1073xxx  and pge2 are major pgs in the mammalian
brain (13,14).  xxxg1073xxx  was first reported to be a sleepinducing substance in the rat brain (15) and then,
subsequently, in the monkey (16), rabbit (17), and cat
(5) brains. infusion of  xxxg1073xxx  into the preoptic area of
the hypothalamus induced sleep during the day or
night, which is indistinguishable from natural sleep
(5,18).  xxxg1073xxx  produced by brain-specific l- xxxg1073xxx  circulates in the cerebrospinal fluid and exhibits circadian fluctuation in parallel with the sleep-wake cycle
(19). in this connection, there have been reports of
decreased or disrupted sleep after administration of
nsaids in both humans and animals during the normal sleep period (20,21).
conversely, infusion of pge2 into the cerebroventricle (22) increased wakefulness. moreover, ah6809
(a pge2 antagonist) increased sleep in rats (23) and
pge2 inhibited sleep in narcoleptic dogs (24). at the
molecular level, pge2 may cause wakefulness by activating arousal neurons in the tuberomamillary nucleus located at posterior hypothalamus via ampatype excitatory amino acid receptors (25). therefore, it
appears that these two pgs with opposing effects on
sleep may be intimately involved in the regulation of
the sleep-wake cycle (26).
based on the known actions of  xxxg1073xxx  and pge2, they
are two likely candidates among cox-1 products that
could be involved in the modulation of diazepaminduced lorr, perhaps an increase in  xxxg1073xxx  and/or a
decrease in pge2 levels. on the contrary, we observed
only a small but significant decrease in  xxxg1073xxx  levels in
the cerebral cortex 30 min after the administration of
diazepam. the exact mechanism by which diazepam
interacts with the  xxxd208xxx  cascade remains to
be elucidated. this would further enhance our understanding of the pharmacology of benzodiazepines.
