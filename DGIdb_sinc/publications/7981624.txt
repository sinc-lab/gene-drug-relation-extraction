annexin 1 regulation in human epidermal cells.  annexin 1 (named p35,  xxxg164xxx  or  xxxg164xxx ), initially described as a glucocorticoid induced protein, belongs to a new characterized family of intracellular proteins. in the skin, the role of annexins has still not been elucidated. in a previous study, we reported the localization of annexin 1 in both freshly isolated human epidermal cells and in cultured keratinocytes using immunofluorescence, facs analysis and immunoblotting techniques. the protein was characterized by western blot and immunoprecipitation as a 35 kda protein. results from in vivo studies confirmed the presence of annexin 1 in basal and suprabasal layers of normal human skin with modified reactivity patterns in hyperproliferative lesions. in the present study, the role of glucocorticoids in annexin 1 regulation was investigated in epidermal cells by western blot and immunoprecipation assays. in contrast to other studies, we found that glucocorticoid treatment of epidermal cells led to a decrease in annexin 1 content in the cytoplasm and the membranes of cells. as annexin 1 was not detected in the nucleus of cells, we conclude that there was a down regulation of annexin 1 after glucocorticoid treatments rather than a translocation of the protein to the nucleus. despite the absence of the signal peptide sequence necessary for protein secretion, annexin 1 was released in the keratinocyte culture medium. we found that the protein was secreted only in low ca2+ medium (0.15 mm), this process required an active metabolism.
