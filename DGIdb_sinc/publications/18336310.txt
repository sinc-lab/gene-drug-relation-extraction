abstract: inhibition of carbonic anhydrase (ca,  xxxg40xxx   xxxg41xxx   xxxg671xxx   xxxg703xxx .1) isoforms present in the eyes (ca i, ii, iv and xii), with sulfonamides such
as acetazolamide,  xxxd2592xxx ,  xxxd2058xxx  and  xxxd1872xxx , is still widely used for the systemic treatment of glaucoma.
the mechanism of action of these drugs consists in inhibition of ca isozymes present in ciliary processes of the eye, with the consequent
reduction of bicarbonate and aqueous humour secretion, and of elevated intraocular pressure (iop) characteristic of this disease. as isoforms ca ii/iv/xii are present in many other tissues/organs, generally, systemic cais possess undesired side effects such as numbness
and tingling of extremities; metallic taste; depression; fatigue; malaise; weight loss; decreased libido; gastrointestinal irritation; metabolic
acidosis; renal calculi and transient myopia. for avoiding these side effects, recently, topically effective cais have been developed in the
last 10 years, with two drugs available clinically:  xxxd1931xxx  and  xxxd367xxx . both these drugs are applied topically as water solutions/suspensions, alone or in combination with other agents (-blockers, prostaglandin derivatives, etc) and produce a consistent and
prolonged reduction of iop. furthermore, recent reports show both the systemically as well as topically acting sulfonamide cais to be
effective in the treatment of macular edema, macular degeneration disease, or diabetic retinopathy, for which pharmacological treatment
is unavailable up to now. much research is in act in the search of more effective topically acting cais, free of the inconveniences and
side effects of the presently available drugs. for achieving this goal, two recently reported strategy, the tail approach and its variant, the
sugar-tail approach, were extensively applied for the synthesis of large numbers of derivatives possessing desired physico-chemical properties. many such new sulfonamides showed promising antiglaucoma activity in animal models of the disease.

1. introduction
the pioneering studies of friedenwald [1], kinsey [2] and kinsey and barany [3] on the chemistry and dynamics of aqueous humor showed that the main constituent of this secretion is sodium
bicarbonate. the next step was the identification of carbonic anhydrase (ca,  xxxg40xxx   xxxg41xxx   xxxg671xxx   xxxg703xxx .1) in the anterior uvea of the eye by wistrand
[4], who showed that it is this enzyme (present mainly in the ciliary
processes) responsible for the bicarbonate secretion, as a consequence of the hydration reaction of carbon dioxide. becker [5] then
showed that the sulfonamide cai acetazolamide, 1, produced a
drop of the intraocular pressure (iop) in experimental animals and
humans, whereas kinsey and reddy [6] proved that this phenomenon is due to a reduced bicarbonate secretion as a consequence of
ca inhibition by the sulfonamide. this was the beginning of a
novel treatment for glaucoma, a condition affecting an increasing
number of the population, which is also the leading cause of blindness in the western countries [7].
2. sulfonamides in the treatment of glaucoma
glaucoma is a chronic, degenerative eye disease, characterized
by high intraocular pressure (iop) that causes irreversible damage
to the optic nerve head and as a result the progressive loss of visual
function and eventually blindness [8,9]. elevated iop (ocular hypertension) is generally indicative of an early stage of the disease
[8,10,11]. cais represent the most physiological treatment of glaucoma, since by inhibiting the ciliary process enzyme (the sulfonamide susceptible isozymes ca ii and ca xii [12-15]) a reduced
rate of bicarbonate and aqueous humor secretion is achieved, which
leads to a 25 – 30 % decrease of iop [12-14]. indeed, acetazolamide 1,  xxxd2592xxx  2,  xxxd2058xxx  3 or  xxxd1872xxx  4
were and are still extensively used systemic drugs in the therapy of
this disease [12-17], as they all act as very efficient inhibitors of

several ca isozymes, and principally of ca ii, and ca xii, the
isozymes thought to be involved in aqueous humor secretion at this
moment [12-15]. it has previously considered [18] that ca iv is
also involved in such processes, but we have recently proved that
some clinically used antiglaucoma sulfonamides act as very weak
human ca iv inhibitors, excluding thus the possibility that this
isozyme plays a critical role in aqueous humor formation in homo
sapiens [19].
the best studied drug of this class is acetazolamide, which is
frequently administered for years due to its efficient reduction of
iop, very reduced toxicity and ideal pharmacokinetic properties
[20]. in the long term therapy acetazolamide 1 is administered in
doses of 250 mg each 6 hours, whereas the more liposoluble, structurally related  xxxd2592xxx  2 in doses of 25 to 100 mg 3 times
daily; an equal dosage of  xxxd1872xxx  4 is also useful in
reducing ocular hypertension [8]. but as cas are ubiquitous enzymes in vertebrates, administration of these systemic sulfonamides
with such a high affinity for the enzyme leads to ca inhibition in
other organs than the target one (i.e., the eye) and as a result, to
undesired side effects of these drugs. the most frequent ones are:
numbness and tingling of extremities; metallic taste; depression;
fatigue; malaise; weight loss; decreased libido; gastrointestinal
irritation; metabolic acidosis; renal calculi and transient myopia
[8,18,21]. although producing all these unpleasant side effects,
systemic sulfonamide cais of the type mentioned above (compounds 1 – 4) are particularly useful in the management of glaucoma resistant to other anti-glaucoma therapies, and in the control
of acute glaucoma attacks [22]. even if the launch of the topically
acting compounds 5 and 6 (see later in the text) initially seemed to
have produced a marked loss of interest in acetazolamide and other
systemic sulfonamides, there are several reasons why acetazolamide and the related drugs 2 – 4 still find a place in the clinical
armamentarium of antiglaucoma drugs: (i)  xxxd1931xxx  5 reduces
iop by up to 23 % as monotherapy, and an extra 15 % when combined with  xxxd3377xxx , whereas acetazolamide 1 alone reduces iop by
30 % [7,12,18]; (ii)  xxxd1931xxx  inhibits aqueous flow by 17 %,
whereas acetazolamide inhibits this parameter by 30 % [23]; (iii)
ocular burning and stinging was reported in 12-19 % of patients
undergoing topical  xxxd1931xxx  treatment, whereas the other topically acting sulfonamide available,  xxxd367xxx  (6) is much less

vision, pruritus, bitter taste [18,24]. all but the last are probably due
to the fact that  xxxd1931xxx  (the best studied topical cai) is the salt
of a weak base with a very strong acid, so that the ph of the drug
solution is rather acidic (generally around 5.5). the last side effect
mentioned above is probably due to drug-laden lachrymal fluid
draining into the oropharynx and inhibition of ca present in the
saliva (ca vi) and the taste buds (ca ii and ca vi), with the consequent accumulation of bicarbonate, and was seen both with systemic as well as topical cais [18,24]. less is known for the moment regarding the side effects of  xxxd367xxx , but it seems that
this drug produces less stinging but more blurred vision as compared to  xxxd1931xxx  [18,24]. unfortunately,  xxxd1931xxx  already
showed some more serious side effects, such as contact allergy
[26], nephrolithiasis [27], anorexia, depression and dementia [28]
and irreversible corneal decompensation in patients who already
presented corneal problems [29]. thus, even if  xxxd1931xxx  and
 xxxd367xxx  represent indeed a major progress in the fight against
glaucoma with therapies based on cais, novel types of topically
effective inhibitors belonging to this class of pharmacological
agents are stringently needed and much investigated.
one approach recently reported for obtaining novel types of
such agents, consisted in attaching water-solubilizing moieties to
the molecules of aromatic/heterocyclic sulfonamides [13-17,25].
such moieties included pyridine-carboximido; carboxypyridinecarboxamido, quinolinesulfonamido; picolinoyl, isonicotinoyl, perfluoroalkyl/ arylsulfonyl-, as well as amino acyl groups among
others, whereas ring systems which have been derivatized by using
the above mentioned moieties included: 2-; 3- or 4-aminobenzenesulfonamides; 4-(-aminoalkyl)-benzenesulfonamides; 3-halogenosubstituted-sulfanilamides; 1,3-benzene-disulfonamides; 1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamides;  xxxd304xxx -2-sulfonamides as well as
thienothiopyran-2-sulfonamides among others, and were chosen in
such a way as to demonstrate that the proposed approach is a general one [30-38]. compounds such as 7-12 showed 2-3 times more
effective topical iop lowering effects in rabbits as compared to
 xxxd1931xxx  [30-38]. they possessed good water solubility (as
hydrochlorides, triflates or trifloroacetates), inhibition in the low
nanomolar range against hca ii (the figures after the number characterizing the compound represent the inhibition constant against
hca ii), good penetrability through the cornea and very good iop

effective than acetazolamide and  xxxd1931xxx  in reducing high iop,
e.g., iop reduction of 20 % when  xxxd367xxx  was administered
three times a day as 1 % suspension [24]. thus, systemically acting
sulfonamide cais are many times preferred by ophthalmologists
for the management of glaucoma, mainly due to their well known
pharmacological properties, low toxicity and much lower cost as
compared to the newer drugs  xxxd1931xxx  and  xxxd367xxx  [22].
the idea to administer topically, directly into the eye, the sulfonamide cai was already addressed by becker [5]. this and other
studies involving the clinically used compounds 1-4 only gave
negative results, being concluded that sulfonamide cais are effective as antiglaucoma drugs only via the systemic route [8,9]. the
lack of efficiency of sulfonamides 1 – 4 via the topical route was
due to the fact that the drug was unable to arrive at the cilliary
processes where ca is present [9,21]. the inadequate drug penetrability through the cornea was due to the fact that sulfonamides 1 – 4
possess inappropriate physico-chemical properties for such a route
of administration. then, in 1983, in a seminal paper maren et al.
[21] postulated that a water-soluble sulfonamide, possessing a relatively balanced lipid solubility (in order to be able to penetrate
through the cornea) as well as strong enough ca inhibitory properties, would be an effective iop lowering drug via the topical route,
but at that moment no inhibitors possessing such physico-chemical
properties existed, as the bio-organic chemistry of this class of
compounds remained relatively unexplored [25]. water-soluble
sulfonamide ca inhibitors started to be developed in several laboratories soon thereafter, and by 1995 the first such pharmacological
agent,  xxxd1931xxx  5 has been launched by merck & co. [18]. a
second compound,  xxxd367xxx  6, developed by alcon laboratories, structurally very similar to  xxxd1931xxx , has then been approved for the topical treatment of glaucoma [24].
 xxxd1931xxx  5 and  xxxd367xxx  6 are nanomolar ca ii/ca
xii inhibitors [12,13-15], possess a good water solubility, are sufficiently liposoluble to penetrate through the cornea, and may be
administered topically, directly into the eye, as a 2 % water solution
(of the  xxxd1931xxx  hydrochloride salt) or as 1 % suspension (as the
 xxxd367xxx  hydrochloride salt) 2 – 3 times a day [18,24]. the two
drugs are effective in reducing iop and show fewer side effects as
compared to the systemically applied drugs. the observed side
effects include stinging, burning or reddening of the eye, blurred

possessing pseudoplastic properties and in consequence, an unusually high ocular penetration, associated to  xxxd1931xxx  hydrochloride (2 % water solution), has also been used in association with
 xxxd1931xxx , which is more efficient as an iop lowering agent in
this combination [18].  xxxd1931xxx  hydrochloride 2 % water solution (or  xxxd367xxx  hydrochloride, 1 % suspension) were shown
to effectively lower iop when associated with the -blocker  xxxd3377xxx

administered acetazolamide [39-43]. in all these cases an additive
effect of about 15 % on iop lowering of the two drugs has been
observed, whereas side effects seemed to be reduced or of diminished intensity as compared to the side effects of each drug alone.

complexes of several 1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide derivatives of type 16 –19, possessing strong ca inhibitory properties
with hydroxypropyl-ß-cyclodextrin (hpcd) have also recently
been investigated for iop lowering properties, being known that the
association of ophthalmologic drugs with cyclodextrins may lead to
enhanced penetration of the drug within the eye [44]. although the
investigated cais 16 –19 possessed very powerful inhibitory properties against the two ca isozymes involved in aqueous humor
production within the eye, i.e., ca ii and ca iv (in the low nanomolar range), these compounds were topically ineffective as iop
lowering agents in normotensive/hypertensive rabbits, due to their
very low water solubility, and impossibility to penetrate through the
cornea, for arriving at the ciliary processes enzymes. on the contrary, the cyclodextrin-sulfonamide complexes proved to be effective and long lasting iop lowering agents in the two animal models
of glaucoma mentioned above, leading to strong iop lowering, as
shown in fig. (1), where data for the standard drug  xxxd1931xxx  are
also provided. it is obvious that association of sulfonamide cais
with cyclodextrins leads to a very efficient iop lowering in this
glaucoma animal model, constituting a thought-provoking approach
for developing antiglaucoma medications for human use.
more recently, sugar moieties have been designed as tails to
induce incrased hydrophilicity and water solubility into sulfonamide cais. winum et al. [45] reported series of n-(p-sulfamoylphenyl)--d-glycopyranosylamines of type 20-27, which was prepared by reaction of sulfanilamide with different monosaccharides
in the presence of ammonium chloride. the new compounds were
investigated for inhibition of cas involved in aqueous humor secretion within the mammalian eye. isozymes ca i and ca ii were
strongly inhibited by some of these compounds, with inhibition
constants in the range of 510-1200 nm against ca i and 10-25 nm
against ca ii, similarly to clinically used sulfonamides, such as
acetazolamide,  xxxd2592xxx ,  xxxd1872xxx ,  xxxd1931xxx 
and  xxxd367xxx . the presence of sugar moieties in these molecules induced an enhanced water solubility as compared to other
sulfonamides. in hypertensive rabbits (a widely used animal model
of glaucoma), two of the new compounds, i.e., 24 and 26 showed
strong and long-lasting ioplowering, being more effective than
 xxxd1931xxx  and  xxxd367xxx , the two clinically used, topically
acting antiglaucoma sulfonamides with ca inhibitory properties
(fig. 1).

amides with cai inhibitory properties act as vasodilators [13,14],
this may explain the use of such drugs for the treatment of retinal
edema, and age-related macular degeneration. in consequence,
these pharmacological agents may represent a new approach for
improving visual function. thus, retinal edema (also referred to as
cystoid macular edema) consists in a swelling process within the
critically important central visual zone, and may develop in association with a variety of ocular conditions such as diabetic retinopathy,
ischemic retinopathies, intraocular surgery (such as cataract removal or implantation of plastic lenses), laser photocoagulation, etc
[46-49]. it is also common in patients affected by retinitis pigmentosa, a hereditary disorder leading to total blindness [50]. the precise mechanism by which the swelling process is triggered is uncertain, but natural metabolic toxins may play a role in this disease
[48]. macular degeneration on the other hand is characterized by
fluid accumulation in the outer retina, accompanied by lipofuscin (a
metabolic waste product) accumulation between photoreceptors and
the villi of the retina pigment epithelium. these catabolic waste
products (also denominated drusen) are generally cleared by the
blood in the healthy retina, but with aging they tend to accumulate
and coalesce, so that vast areas of the retinal photoreceptors become

the development of topically acting carbonic anhydrase inhibitors

disengaged from their neighboring retinal pigment epithelial villi
[46-49]. as a consequence of drusen confluencing in the foveal
area, the affected sections of the retina become blind which may
trigger a macular degenerative disease, with dramatic loss of the
visual function. no satisfactory current therapy for this condition is
known for the moment [48,49].
the use of cais in the treatment of macular edema is based on
the important observation of [46] that acetazolamide 1 (as sodium
salt) is effective in the treatment of this condition, when administered systemically. a similar efficiency has also recently been reported for  xxxd1931xxx  [47,48], after topical administration (obviously, without the side effects of the systemic inhibitor 1). it is
generally assumed that the disappearance of the edema and the
improvement of visual function are independent of the hypotensive
activity of the sulfonamide, being due to direct effects of the drug
on the circulation in the retina [48]. practically, acetazolamide,
 xxxd1931xxx  or  xxxd367xxx  act as local vasodilators [13], and
improve blood flow in this organ, and in consequence clearing of
metabolic waste products, drusen, etc. the improvement of visual
function after such a treatment (in early phases of the disease)
seems to be very good [48].
it has also been reported that acetazolamide (375 mg/day) is
effective in the treatment of serous retinal detachment of various
etiologies (this disease is also generally not amenable to treatment)
[51]. additional studies should be done in order to establish
whether the topically acting sulfonamide cais might be also used
in this serious medical problem.
