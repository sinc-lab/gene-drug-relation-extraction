we tested the hypothesis that allelic variants of the human
 xxxg656xxx  e8 genotype are associated with (i)
dopamine d2 antagonist tiapride dose in treatment of
alcohol withdrawal (n 50) and (ii) with anxiety and
depression in patients during alcoholism detoxi®cation
therapy (admission n 87; discharge n 50).  xxxg656xxx  e8 a/
a genotype was associated with increased dose of tiapride
during a 9-day detoxi®cation therapy and with increased
anxiety and depression scores on admission and 2 weeks
later. the ®ndings suggest a pharmacogenetic in¯uence of
 xxxg656xxx  e8 genotype on tiapride ef®cacy in alcohol
withdrawal. in an earlier report,  xxxg656xxx  e8 a/a genotype
was associated with reduced responsiveness to the
dopamine d2 agonist  xxxd200xxx ; however, it is not clear
whether both ®ndings share the same biological basis.

introduction

genetic factors explain 40±60% of the risk of developing alcohol use disorders (schuckit, 2000). studies of
human subjects, as well as of experimental animal
models, suggest a central role of the dopamine d2
receptor to be a modulator of addictive behaviour
(mcbride & li, 1998; myers & robinson, 1999; li,
2000). in a single photon emission computed tomography study with 21 alcohol-dependent patients, low
levels of dopamine or an increased density of free
striatal dopaminergic d2 receptors was related to early
relapse (guardia et al., 2000). however, data concerning
an association of several  xxxg656xxx  ( xxxg656xxx )
dna variants with alcohol dependence have yielded
con¯icting results (noble et al., 1991; uhl et al., 1992;
gelernter et al., 1993; gejman et al., 1994; higuchi et
al., 1994; suarez et al., 1994; neiswanger et al., 1995;
sander et al., 1995; finckh et al., 1996a; gorwood et al.,
2000; parsian et al., 2000).
finckh and colleagues described another a to g substitution polymorphism 52 bp downstream of the  xxxg656xxx 
stop codon in exon 8 (finckh et al., 1996b). the  xxxg656xxx 
e8 a/a genotype was associated with increased anxiety
and depression scores during follow-up after clinical
detoxi®cation treatment as well as with increased

suicide attempts (finckh et al., 1997).  xxxg656xxx  e8 a/a
also showed a tendency towards more severe withdrawal symptoms, early relapse and reduced response
to the dopamine d2 agonist  xxxd200xxx  measured by
secretion of  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx  (gh) (finckh et al.,
1997). gh response to  xxxd200xxx  is a measure of d2
receptor responsiveness (lal et al., 1972; balldin et al.,
1993). so far, no replication study concerning an
association between  xxxg656xxx  e8 genotype and alcohol
withdrawal outcome has been published.
pharmacological data provide independent support for
the role of the dopaminergic system and the d2
receptor in alcohol withdrawal. withdrawal symptomatology was positively correlated with peripheral dopamine levels on day 1 of a detoxi®cation treatment
(heinz et al., 1996). in the same study, an initially (day
1) reduced response of  xxxd200xxx  induced gh
secretion was also observed. heinz et al. (1996) further
reported increased dopamine plasma levels on day 8 of
alcohol detoxi®cation therapy in alcohol dependent
patients (n  40) but not on day 1 compared with
healthy control subjects (n  10). the ®nding of an
increased dopaminergic activity during withdrawal is in
line with the observation that tiapride, a dopamine d2
antagonist, reduces withdrawal symptomatology (peters

648 pharmacogenetics 2001, vol 11 no 8

& faulds, 1994). tiapride is not used frequently in
detoxi®cation treatment; however, the background of
some of the above mentioned data is of interest: (i)
tiapride is a highly selective d2 /d3 antagonist [d2 : ic50
(ìm)  0.32; d3 : ic50 (ìm)  0.18] (perrault et al.,
1996); and (ii) tiapride antagonizes  xxxd200xxx  induced effects in mice and rats (perrault et al., 1996). as
the  xxxg656xxx  e8 a/a genotype has been found to be
associated with a reduced responsiveness to the d2
agonist  xxxd200xxx , we hypothesize a similarly altered
responsiveness to the d2 antagonist tiapride in the
treatment of alcohol withdrawal. in the present study,
we tested the following hypotheses on the basis of the
previous ®ndings: (i)  xxxg656xxx  e8 a/a genotype is associated with a reduced ef®cacy of tiapride or higher dose
demand, respectively, in treating alcohol withdrawal
symptomatology; (ii)  xxxg656xxx  e8 a/a is associated with
increased anxiety and depressiveness on admission and
during a 14-day detoxi®cation treatment.

materials and methods
subjects

one hundred and ten caucasian patients of german
origin with alcohol dependence (icd-10) admitted for
alcohol detoxi®cation therapy (102 males, eight females, mean age 42.5  9.3 years) were genotyped.
these patients were derived from an open-label study
testing the ef®cacy of alcohol withdrawal treatment
strategies with a total number of n  127 patients.
patients with withdrawal symptomatology were assigned to four treatment groups according to respiratory
alcohol concentrations on beginning of alcohol withdrawal syndrome: patients with alcohol concentrations
, 1½ were assigned to treatment groups (1) tiapride/
carbamazepine, (2) clomethiazol or (3) diazepam. patients with alcohol concentrations of 1½ or more were
assigned to group (4) and treated with tiapride/carbamazepine only. this was to study ef®cacy and safety of
tiapride/carbamazepine in individuals with alcohol
withdrawal syndrome, who were still intoxicated (data
not provided here). assignment took place in blocks of
10 per treatment group in order of admission provided
that no exclusion criteria were ful®lled and no reason
for a preference or for increased risk because of any
medication could be found. within a maximum treatment duration of 9 days, medication was given dependent on severity of withdrawal symptomatology up to
the following maximum doses: tiapride, 1800 mg/day;
carbamazepine, 1200 mg/day; clomethiazole, 20 capsules (approximately 3840 mg/day, capsules or syrup
equivalent); and diazepam, 80 mg/day. because medication has been given corresponding to withdrawal symptomatology, we used it as a measure for withdrawal
severity similar to heinz et al. (1996). withdrawal
symptomatology was measured with the aws scale,
twice daily (wetterling et al., 1997). within the regular

2-week detoxi®cation, patients also received abstinence
focused psychotherapy.
psychiatric history was obtained by experienced psychiatrists. outcome was assessed with (i) cumulative
daily medication dose for each of the 9 treatment days;
(b) visual analogue scales assessing subjective withdrawal symptomatology for the ®rst 7 days; and (c)
scl-90-r, a 90-item self-report rating scale widely
used to measure current psychopathology (recent
7 days; derogatis, 1983). scl-90-r was applied on
admission (t1 ) and on discharge (t2 ). because the
amount of change in psychopathology is correlated with
time, one analysis of scl-90-r subscales on t2 used
data from patients with a treatment duration > 12 and
< 15 days only. informed consent was obtained from all
patients and the study was approved by the joint ethics
committee of the ernst moritz arndt university
greifswald and the chamber of physicians mecklenburg-pomerania.
polymerase chain reaction based genotyping

dna was extracted from 7.5 ml edta anticoagulated
blood with a standard procedure (miller et al., 1988).
the a to g substitution polymorphism 52 bp downstream of the  xxxg656xxx  stop codon was genotyped as
previously described by samochowiec et al. (2000).
statistical analysis

data were analysed with spss for windows (version
10.0, spss inc., chicago, il, usa). differences between groupings were analysed with anova. regression analysis was applied to test for relationships
between continuous data. outcome variables as dependent variables over time, with genotype as independent
variable, were analysed with repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance (manova).

genetic data analysis

dna was available for 110 out of 127 individuals. no
signi®cant deviation from hardy±weinberg equilibrium
was found (observed n: a/a  39, a/g  58, g/g  13;
expected n: a/a  42.0, a/g  51.9, g/g  16.0; chisquared  1.504, d.f.  1, p . 0.1). the frequencies of

(1997) (fg  0.329) and ours (fg  0.382; chisquared  5.266, d.f.  1, p , 0.025). there were no
signi®cant differences in genotype counts across the
four treatment groups in our study (table 1). there
was a very similar genotypic distribution in males
(n  102; a/a: 35.3; a/g: 52.9; g/g: 11.8) and females

we tested scl-90-r scores on admission (t1 ) and on
discharge (t2 ) with an anova with genotype and
medication as independent variables. sample sizes
varied across analyses due to missing data for some of
the variables. readiness to answer scl-90-r on discharge was smaller compared to admission. as a ®rst
step, we only included patients with treatment durations between 12 and 15 days into the analysis of t2

data. this was in order to obtain a temporally homogeneous subsample, because psychopathology varies as
a function of time. the second reason was that attrition
rate within this group (12±15 days treatment) was only
18.5% compared to 56.5% in those not completing the
whole treatment program in time (approximately
2 weeks). subscales somatization, obsessive compulsion, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, psychoticism and global severity index (gsi) showed
higher scores on admission in homozygous a/a individuals; the same was true for all subscales on discharge
(t2 ; anova; table 2). no genotype±medication interaction at p , 0.05 level of signi®cance was observed in
t1 or t2 (trend level p , 0.1 in t2 : phobic anxiety). in
a repeated measures manova, all scl-90-r subscales showed signi®cantly higher scores in homozygous
a/a individuals (table 3); no genotype±medication
interactions were observed. analyses were performed
across all treatment groups.
including all subjects who provided data on t2 regardless of treatment duration, somatization, phobic anxiety
and gsi showed signi®cantly higher scores in homozygous a/a individuals; interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anger-hostility and psychoticism showed
higher values in a/a subjects at the p , 0.1 level
(table 4). including all subjects who provided data on
t2 into a repeated measures manova, homozygous
a/a individuals showed higher scores in subscales
somatization, interpersonal sensitivity, psychoticism
and global severity index, at the p , 0.1 level the same

was true for all other scl-90-r subscales except for
phobic anxiety and paranoid ideation (table 5).
subjective withdrawal symptomatology (subjective
medication response, tremor, sweating) as measured by
visual analogue scales (vas) was not different indicating that individual titration of medication towards
nearly complete symptom control was successful and
that differences in withdrawal symptomatology are
mainly re¯ected by medication doses. however, psychological variables nervousness (n  62, p  0.030)
and sleep (n  62, p  0.040) showed signi®cantly
higher pathological values in individuals with a/a
genotypes; no differences were observed in vas tension and energy.

discussion

in this study, an association between  xxxg656xxx  e8 homozygous a/a genotype and increased dose of dopamine
d2 antagonist tiapride for treating alcohol withdrawal
symptomatology has been found for the ®rst time.
furthermore, we replicated the association between
the  xxxg656xxx  e8 a/a genotype and increased depression
and anxiety in patients during alcoholism detoxi®cation
which was ®rst described by finckh et al. (1997). they
reported signi®cantly higher mean depression and anxiety values in patients 3 weeks after detoxi®cation and
all following measurements until the end of month 6.
further support concerning the in¯uence of  xxxg656xxx  e8
upon withdrawal severity was reported by koehnke et
al. (1999) who found an association between  xxxg656xxx  e8

mean (6 sd) self-reported psychopathology scores (scl-90-r) on admission t1 (all treatment durations) and
discharge t2 (treatment duration 12±15 days) of alcohol detoxi®cation therapy

a/a genotype and history of delirium in 131 patients
with alcohol dependence. although phenotype characterization differed slightly, all three studies show an
association between  xxxg656xxx  e8 a/a genotype and more
severe alcohol withdrawal.
tiapride ef®cacy could be explained by a reduction
of dopaminergic hyperactivity during alcohol withdrawal by antagonizing postsynaptic d2 -receptors and

thereby decreasing withdrawal symptomatology. according to our hypothesis,  xxxg656xxx  e8 a/a genotype
was associated with an increased demand for tiapride
similar to the earlier report of a decreased response to
the d2 agonist  xxxd200xxx . it is not clear, however,
whether the high dose demand of  xxxg656xxx  e8 a/a
genotype has the same biological basis as the previously reported reduced response to the dopaminergic agonist  xxxd200xxx .

652 pharmacogenetics 2001, vol 11 no 8

our data support the idea that dopamine genetic
variants do not alter disease risk per se but rather
related traits (gorwood et al., 2000), such as alcohol
withdrawal symptomatology. functional assays are not
yet available for  xxxg656xxx  e8 or neighbouring 39 utr
polymorphisms, which might in¯uence  xxxg656xxx  transcript
half-life or pre- and post-transcriptional regulation in a
similar way to other mammalian 39-utr sequences.
because of this and the de®ciency of pharmacokinetic
and pharmacodynamic data to describe interactions
between  xxxg656xxx , dopamine and tiapride, we cannot suf®ciently explain the mechanism of the striking
similarity between  xxxd200xxx  and tiapride ef®cacy.
within the tiapride group, an allele±dose relationship
seems to be likely as far as the number of g-alleles
appeared to be inversely correlated with tiapride dose
demand (fig. 2). this result validates a similar ®nding
of finckh et al. (1997) who used a modi®ed version of
the clinical institute withdrawal assessment for alcohol
scale (ciwa-ar; sullivan et al., 1989) to assess withdrawal symptomatology instead of tiapride dose. however, the difference in tiapride doses between
genotypes a/g and g/g was not signi®cant, possibly
due to small sample size.
it is of interest that only tiapride dose was found to be
associated with  xxxg656xxx  e8 genotype while diazepam
and clomethiazol doses were not. assuming this result
to be correct, it would be in line with the lack of
af®nity of both substances to the  xxxg656xxx . however, sample sizes in our clomethiazol and
diazepam groups were small and so possible differences
might have been overlooked.
because tiapride does not have anticonvulsive properties, it has to be given together with carbamazepine in
order to prevent withdrawal seizures. carbamazepine
also reduces withdrawal symptomatology and so the
treatment effect within the tiapride/carbamazepine
group is a mixed one. carbamazepine can alter dopamine turnover in various brain areas and an interaction
with tiapride cannot be ruled out a priori (elphick et
al., 1990; okada et al., 1997; ichikawa & meltzer, 1999;
lahoste et al., 2000). because carbamazepine, however,
has not been reported to interact with the dopamine
 xxxg656xxx , we conclude that the reported allelespeci®c association is at least partly due to the effects
of tiapride.
in patients with a/a genotype, depression and anxiety
scores were higher both on admission (t1 ) and discharge (t2 ) within a time-frame of 12±15 days of
detoxi®cation treatment. again, our data suggest an
inverse effect of the number of g-alleles of  xxxg656xxx  e8
(table 1) upon withdrawal-associated psychopathology.
this is in line with the observations of finckh et al.
(1997) who found similar allele±dose relationship be-

fore and 2 weeks (and later) after detoxi®cation therapy. sample sizes in both studies, however, were too
small to perform post-hoc tests between genotypes.
also, other psychopathology showed an association with
 xxxg656xxx  e8 genotype in our study. however scl-90-r
subscales are correlated with each other, so further
interpretation of other psychopathology subscales cannot be drawn from these data and should be subject to
further investigation. including all scl-90-r values on
t2 decreased the number of signi®cant differences in
psychopathology. this might be due to the high attrition rate of patients who have not completed the
therapy program (12±15 treatment days), resulting in a
bias due to a temporally inhomogeneous distribution of
psychopathology values. however, depression (tendency) and phobic anxiety ( p , 0.05) still showed a
tendency towards higher scores in a/a individuals (total
group t2 ).
patients usually had to be treated immediately on
admission and before answering the questionnaires, and
so scl-90-r scores may have been in¯uenced by
medication already given. however, scl-90-r covers
psychopathology 1 week before application. in our
models, with genotype and medication as independent
variables, no gene±medication interaction could be
detected on t1 and t2 at the p , 0.05 level of
signi®cance and we conclude that scl-90-r measures
re¯ect genotype differences in this approach.
a number of shortcomings have to be addressed:
gender differences have not been assessed due to small
sample size. they might be important because finckh
et al. (1997) found gender difference in the in¯uence of
 xxxg656xxx  e8 genotype on withdrawal severity. however,
there were no gender speci®c differences in genotype
distribution of  xxxg656xxx  e8 in our sample. medication was
given open and so the results of ef®cacy parameters are
prone to bias. however, no double-blind study could
be carried out in this severely affected population
because most patients were unable to give consent for
such a study on admission due to intoxication, withdrawal symptomatology or a combination of both.
 xxxg656xxx  e8 genotypes might also determine ef®cacy of
tiapride as a relapse prevention substance via reduction
of depression and anxiety. such a mechanism has
already been reported (shaw et al., 1987, 1994). relapse
is not only associated with affective states, but also with
craving for alcohol. the dopaminergic system has been
proposed to be associated with a craving type called
reward craving (verheul et al., 1999). other craving
types might be associated with other neurotransmitters.
we suggest that genetic variability determines response
patterns to various relapse reducing medications. a
further investigation of the molecular basis of the
pathophysiology of alcoholism might help to tailor

 xxxg656xxx  exon 8, tiapride ef®cacy and withdrawal lucht et al. 653

individual pharmacological treatment strategies for relapse prevention and comorbid affective disorders. we
also suggest testing  xxxg656xxx  e8 in affective and anxiety
disorders in patients without alcohol dependence. similar but non-signi®cant ®ndings in two studies of possible inverse g-allele dose-related in¯uence upon
psychopathology, withdrawal severity, drug response or
dose demand, make  xxxg656xxx  e8 a polymorphism of high
interest for further pharmacogenetic studies.
