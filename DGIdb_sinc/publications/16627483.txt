folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism, which occurs both in the cytoplasm and in mitochondria (see fig. 1) (1). thf cofactors carry onecarbon units at three oxidation states ranging from formate to methanol
(2). the biologically active thf derivatives contain a reduced pteridine
and a polyglutamate peptide consisting of five to eight glutamate residues linked by ␥-peptide bonds (3). cytoplasmic folate-mediated onecarbon metabolism is required for the de novo synthesis of purines (supplies the carbon-2 and carbon-8 of the purine ring) and thymidylate
(methylation of dump to  xxxd3365xxx ), and also for remethylation of homocysteine to methionine (2, 3). methionine can be converted to s- xxxd3156xxx  (sam) and serve as a methyl donor for numerous methylation reactions, including the methylation of dna, rna, and
proteins. serine is a primary source of folate-activated one-carbon units
(4).  xxxg2068xxx  ( xxxg2068xxx ) catalyzes
the thf-dependent aldol cleavage of serine to methylene-thf and
glycine. alternatively, serine can be converted to glycine and formate in
the mitochondria through mitochondrial folate-mediated one-carbon
metabolism (5) (fig. 1). the formate produced in the mitochondria is a
major source of one-carbon units for cytoplasmic one-carbon metabolism through its conversion to 10-formyl-thf by the enzyme c1-thf
synthase ( xxxg1473xxx ) (6).
folate deficiency impairs  xxxd3365xxx , methionine, and sam synthesis,
resulting in increased rates of uracil misincorporation into dna and
dna hypomethylation (5). therefore, maintenance of cellular folate
concentrations is critical for both dna synthesis and genome stability
and expression. intracellular folate concentrations are influenced by
folate availability, uptake, polyglutamylation, turnover, and export (5).
folate monoglutamates are transported into the cell either by folate
receptors (frs) or carrier-mediated proteins (7, 8) and then converted
to folate polyglutamates by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase.
the addition of the polyglutamate chain is required for cellular retention of folate cofactors (9 –12). reduced folate polyglutamates are
sequestered by folate-binding proteins inside the cell that exhibit kd
values in the low micromolar to nanomolar range (13). studies have
indicated that the concentration of cellular folate-binding proteins
exceeds the concentration of total intracellular folate. in liver, for example, the concentration of folate-binding proteins exceeds the concentration of folate by 5- to 10-fold (5, 13); it has been suggested that the
concentration of cellular folate-binding proteins may set the upper limit
for intracellular folate accumulation (5).
 xxxg131xxx  (fdh;  xxxg131xxx ) is one
of the most abundant folate-binding proteins present in liver (14). fdh
catalyzes the nadp⫹-dependent conversion of 10-formyl-thf to thf
and co2 (1, 15). mice lacking fdh activity are viable and fertile, indicating that one or more fdh functions are not essential in the laboratory environment (16); fdh may function to regulate the folate-medi-

 xxxg131xxx  (fdh) catalyzes the
nadpⴙ-dependent conversion of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to co2
and tetrahydrofolate (thf) and is an abundant high affinity folatebinding protein. although several activities have been ascribed to
fdh, its metabolic role in folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism is
not well understood. fdh has been proposed to: 1) inhibit purine biosynthesis by depleting 10-formyl-thf pools, 2) maintain cellular folate
concentrations by sequestering thf, 3) deplete the supply of folateactivated one-carbon units, and 4) stimulate the generation of thfactivated one-carbon unit synthesis by channeling folate cofactors to
other folate-dependent enzymes. the metabolic functions of fdh
were investigated in neuroblastoma, which do not contain detectable
levels of fdh. both low and high fdh expression reduced total cellular
folate concentrations by 60%, elevated rates of folate catabolism, and
depleted cellular 5-methyl-thf and s- xxxd3156xxx  levels.
low fdh expression increased the formyl-thf/thf ratio nearly
10-fold, whereas thf accounted for nearly 50% of total folate in neuroblastoma with high fdh expression. fdh expression did not affect
the enrichment of exogenous formate into methionine, serine, or
purines and did not suppress de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis.
we conclude that low fdh expression facilitates the incorporation of
one-carbon units into the one-carbon pool, whereas high levels of fdh
expression deplete the folate-activated one-carbon pool by catalyzing
the conversion of 10-formyl-thf to thf. furthermore, fdh does not
increase cellular folate concentrations by sequestering thf in neuroblastoma nor does it inhibit or regulate de novo purine biosynthesis.
fdh expression does deplete cellular 5-methyl-thf and s- xxxd3156xxx  levels indicating that fdh impairs the folate-dependent
homocysteine remethylation cycle.

experimental procedures
materials—[6s]-[3h]5-formyl-thf (40 ci/mmol) was obtained
from moravek biochemicals, inc., and [methyl-3h]thymidine was from
perkinelmer life sciences. [6r,s]-5-formyl-thf was from sapec, the
chemical division of cerbios-pharma sa, barbengo, switzerland. fetal
bovine serum, ␣-minimal essential medium (␣mem), and ␣-modification lacking sodium bicarbonate, folate, ribosides, ribotides, deoxyribosides, and deoxyribotides (defined as ␣mem) were obtained from
hyclone laboratories. folate-depleted fetal bovine serum was prepared
by dialyzing serum against ten volumes of phosphate-buffered saline at
4 °c for 24 h with buffer changes every 4 h, then charcoal-treated to
remove any remaining folate.
cell lines and culture medium—the sh-sy5y human neuroblastoma cell line has been described previously (24). cells were cultured in
␣mem with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for all experiments. fdh
expression was induced in cell lines by the addition of 1 ␮g/ml tetracycline for a minimum of 4 days prior to experimentation.
generation of human fdh-expressing cell lines—cdna from a fetal
liver library (clontech) was used as the template to amplify the human
fdh open reading frame in two fragments. the first fragment (fragment a) of the human fdh cdna (nucleotides 91–1389 from the
sequence mn 012190; ncbi) was amplified using the forward primer
5⬘-ccctcctgctaccatgaagatt-3⬘ and the reverse primer
5⬘-cccccccaatgaagagctggt-3⬘. the cycling conditions were
94 °c for 45 s, 51 °c for 45 s, and 72 °c for 90 s for a total of 33 cycles. the
second fragment (fragment b) of the human fdh cdna (nucleotides
1369 –2854) was amplified using the forward primer 5⬘-tgccccaccagctcttgattg-3⬘ and the reverse primer 5⬘-aggggcagggactttcttctcaga-3⬘. the cycling conditions were 94 °c for 45 s,
54 °c for 45 s, and 72 °c for 90 s for a total of 33 cycles. fragments a and
b were cloned into the pcr vector using the blunt end topo kit
(invitrogen). the nucleotide sequences of fragments a and b were
determined from three different clones and all were identical. this
sequence was also identical to the sequence of the human fdh available
on the ncbi data base (genbanktm accession no. nm 012190). fragment a was excised from the pcr plasmid with kpni and xhoi and
subcloned into the pko vector (generating pko-a). fragment b was
excised from the pcr-b vector with kpni and xhoi, the fragment gel
purified and digested with sapi (which is present in the 1374 –1389 nt
overlap region of both fragments a and b). the vector pko-a was

ated one-carbon metabolic network in specific cell-types. fdh
expression is restricted normally to the liver and brain, and its range of
tissue-specific expression parallels that of  xxxg2068xxx  (17, 18), whereas
folate-dependent enzymes that catalyze biosynthetic reactions are
believed to be expressed more ubiquitously.
at least four physiological, and perhaps contradictory, functions
have been ascribed to fdh. first, krebs et al. (19) suggested that
fdh serves to remove excess one-carbon units from folate metabolism by depleting pools of folate-activated one-carbon units. in support of this hypothesis, mice with a heritable fdh deficiency exhibit
4-fold lower relative hepatic thf concentrations and 2.6-fold higher
relative 10-formyl-thf concentrations compared with the livers of
control mice (16). second, fdh has been suggested to sequester and
store cellular folate in the form of thf (2, 20). fdh purified from
rabbit liver contains tightly bound thf polyglutamates (kd ⫽ 15 nm)
and its catalytic reaction exhibits product inhibition by thf (21). in
mammalian liver, fdh represents between 0.5 and 1.0% of total
soluble protein (15). in rabbit liver, the concentration of fdh has
been estimated to be 42 ␮m; intracellular folate concentrations are
estimated to be 25–35 ␮m in liver (22). because intracellular fdh
concentrations exceed thf concentrations, all cytoplasmic thf is
expected to be bound by fdh in vivo (21). mice lacking fdh exhibit
a 35% reduction in total folate concentrations despite being maintained on folate sufficient diets, indicating that fdh may help to
maintain cellular folate concentrations by sequestering cellular thf
(16). third, fdh has been proposed to inhibit purine biosynthesis by
depleting cellular 10-formyl-thf pools (23). finally, fdh has been
suggested to facilitate the generation of folate-activated one-carbons
by channeling thf to the enzymes  xxxg2068xxx  and  xxxg1473xxx  (21).
these two enzymes are the primary entry points for one-carbon
units into one-carbon metabolism (fig. 1). fdh displays product
inhibition by thf and contains a second thf-tight-binding site that
is distinct from the active site (20). both  xxxg2068xxx  and  xxxg1473xxx 
suppress thf-mediated product inhibition of fdh and thereby
accelerate the catalytic rate of fdh by 2-fold (21). to validate the
purported and inferred physiological functions of fdh, the effects of
fdh expression on the folate-mediated one-carbon metabolic network and cellular folate concentrations were examined in sh-sy5y
neuroblastoma, a cell line that does not express detectable levels of
the enzyme.

the average and standard deviation of two separate experiments, each
with ten replicates. these values were normalized to the lowest a550

that contained 2 ␮m  xxxd2146xxx . total cellular folate, the distribution of
folate derivatives, and folate polyglutamate chain lengths were determined by affinity/reversed-phase hplc as described elsewhere (26).
for sam and sah determinations, cells were cultured to 80% confluence in ␣mem. 4 h prior to harvest, cells were cultured in ␣mem
lacking methionine to ensure sam levels reflected cellular homocysteine remethylation capacity and not exogenous methionine availability. sam and sah were extracted from the cells and quantified by
hplc with fluorescence detection relative to standard curves as
described elsewhere (27).
stable isotope tracer studies—to quantify the enrichment of [2,3,32

5-formyl-thf, 10 ␮m methionine, 0.2 mm glycine, 1 mg/liter pyridoxine, 26 mg/liter l-[5,5,5- xxxd2360xxx ]leucine. cells were cultured using treatment medium for a total of 8 days, and the medium was replaced every
2 days. cells were harvested by washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, then trypsinized and pelleted by centrifugation. cellular
protein and nuclear dna were isolated as described previously (27).
protein pellets were suspended in 6 n hcl (100 ␮l) in vacuum hydrolysis tubes and heated at 100 °c for 20 h. the amino acids were purified
by cation exchange chromatography, converted to heptafluorobutyryl
n-propyl ester derivatives, and then separated on an hp- xxxd1405xxx  column
(30 m ⫻ 0.25 mm). isotopic enrichment was determined in electron
capture negative ionization mode by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using a model 6890 gas chromatograph and model 5973 mass
spectrometer (hewlett-packard corp., palo alto, ca). selected ion
monitoring was conducted at a mass-to-charge ratio m/z 519 –523 for
serine, m/z 305–308 for dehydroalanine, m/z 349 –353 for leucine, m/z

sapi and kpni sites), generating the entire human fdh cdna in the
pko vector. the fdh cdna was excised from the pko vector with
noti and ecorv and subcloned into the pcdna4/to/myc-his c vector (invitrogen) generating pcdna4-fdh.
stable sh-sy5y cell lines expressing the human fdh cdna from the
pcdna6/tr vector (invitrogen) were generated. sh-sy5y cells were
electroporated with 20 ␮g of plasmid dna (pcdna4-fdh) at 0.22 kv
and 950 microfarads (bio-rad gene-pulser), then cultured with ␣mem
for 48 h. the medium was replaced with ␣mem containing blasticidin
(10 ␮g/ml) and zeocin (100 ␮g/ml, invitrogen) to select for stable integrants. individual colonies resistant to zeocin treatment were selected
and expanded using ␣mem containing blasticidin and zeocin, and
clonal lines expressing human fdh protein were screened by western
blot analyses.
determination of pabg levels in culture medium—cells were
seeded (5.6 ⫻ 106) into 100-mm primaria culture dishes (falcon) containing 5 ml of ␣mem. following 5-h incubation, the medium was
replaced with defined ␣mem containing 25 nm [6s]-[5-3h]formylthf. aliquots of medium were taken at various time points, clarified by
centrifugation, and stored at ⫺80 °c. folate degradation products were
analyzed in these samples by reversed-phase hplc as described elsewhere (25). samples were spiked with unlabeled pabg, [6r,s]-5formyl-thf, and [6s]-5-methyl-thf to determine the identity of the
radiolabeled fractions. with this method, pabg elutes at 6 min,
5-formyl-thf elutes at 20 min, and 5-methyl-thf elutes at 37 min. for
each analysis, 1.0-ml fractions were collected into scintillation tubes,
and the tritium was quantified using a beckman ls 6500 liquid scintillation counter.
western blot analyses of fdh,  xxxg861xxx , and fr—cells were cultured
to 75% confluence in ␣mem. cell pellets were lysed using a buffer
containing 10 mm tris, ph 7.5, 150 mm  xxxd3213xxx , 5 mm edta,
1% triton x-100, 20 mm 2- xxxd26xxx , 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. the lysates were centrifuged, and protein concentration of
the supernatant was determined. protein extracts (60 ␮g/lane) were run
on an 8% sds-page gel (for fdh analysis) or a 12% sds-page gel (for
fr and  xxxg861xxx  analysis), then transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride
microporous membrane (millipore) using a minitransblot apparatus
(bio-rad). for detection of fdh, the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °c with primary antiserum (1:10,000 dilution) consisting of
purified polyclonal antibodies generated in sheep against a highly conserved peptide sequence of human fdh (amino acid residues 390 –
410). for detection of  xxxg861xxx  and fr, the membrane was incubated
overnight at 4 °c with polyclonal antibodies (1:1000 dilution) that recognize the human fr or  xxxg861xxx  (santa cruz biotechnology). the
membrane was washed using 0.1% tween 20 in phosphate-buffered
saline, then incubated for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
rabbit anti-sheep secondary antibody for the detection of fdh (1:6500
dilution, pierce), and rabbit anti-goat secondary antibody for the detection of fr and  xxxg861xxx  (1:7000 dilution, pierce). proteins were visualized using the super signal west pico chemiluminescence detection
system (pierce). the protein bands were quantified using chemiimager
4400 from alpha innotech corp. (san leandro, ca).
cell growth assays—the effect of human fdh cdna expression on

results and discussion
cloning of the human fdh cdna and generation of a tetracyclineinducible stable cell line—a stable sh-sy5y cell line that expresses
the human fdh cdna from a tetracycline-inducible promoter
(pcdna4/to/myc-hisb vector, invitrogen) was isolated (referred to as
sh-sy5yfdh). fdh protein was not detected in nontransfected
sh-sy5y cells; sh-sy5yfdh cells cultured in the absence of tet exhibited very low but detectable levels of fdh protein (1.5-fold over densitometry background) (fig. 2a). sh-sy5yfdh cells cultured with tet
(sh-sy5yfdh⫹tet) exhibited 13.3-fold greater fdh protein levels
than present in sh-sy5yfdh cells culture without tet. these cell
lines were used to validate the previously ascribed metabolic roles of
fdh in folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism. specifically, the
effects of both low and high level fdh expression on: 1) intracellular
folate concentrations, 2) the 10-formyl-thf/thf ratio, 3) sam levels, and 4) flux within the folate-mediated one-carbon metabolic

were removed at defined time points (0 and 5.5 h) immediately following the addition of

tions compared with the parent cell line, sh-sy5y (table 1). these
results do not support a role for fdh in maintaining cellular folate
stores by sequestering or trapping cellular thf. reductions in cellular
folate can result from decreased rates of cellular transport and/or
increased rates of turnover (5). therefore, the effects of fdh expression
on both fr expression and folate catabolism were investigated. fr facilitates transport of  xxxd2146xxx  into the cell (30), and its expression
increases with cellular folate deficiency in cell culture models (31).
sh-sy5yfdh cells cultured in the presence or absence of tet displayed
increased fr protein levels relative to nontransfected cells as determined by western blot analyses (fig. 2b), consistent with fdh expression creating a functional folate deficiency in sh-sy5y cells. these data
also indicate that the fdh-induced decrease in cellular folate concentrations is not the result of impaired fr-mediated folate transport.
the effects of fdh expression on rates of folate catabolism, as evidenced by the generation of the folate degradation product para-aminobenzoylglutamate (pabg), were determined in culture medium following exposure to [3h]5-formyl-thf as described previously (25).
sh-sy5yfdh cells cultured in the absence and presence of tet generated 20% and 2.5-fold more [3h]pabg, respectively, compared with
sh-sy5y cells (fig. 3). these results indicate that fdh expression
accelerates folate catabolism in these cells, which may contribute to the
decreased folate concentrations. however, the modest increase in
pabg generation between the sh-sy5y cells and sh-sy5yfdh cells
cultured without tet was not statistically significant, suggesting that
increased rates of folate catabolism alone may not account for the
observed differences in folate concentrations assuming that pabg is the
primary product of folate catabolism (fig. 3). furthermore, fdh
expression had no effect on the average length of intracellular folate
polyglutamate chains (table 1). increased rates of folate catabolism

6890 gas chromatograph and model 5973 mass spectrometer (hewlettpackard corp.). selected ion monitoring was conducted at a mass-tocharge ratio m/z 255–257 for thymine, m/z 280 –283 for adenine, and
m/z 368 –371 for guanine.
formate suppression assay—this assay was developed to quantify
the efficiency of de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis (as monitored
by the incorporation of [14c]formate into purine deoxynucleotides) relative to purine nucleotide biosynthesis through the salvage pathway (as
monitored by the incorporation of [3h]hypoxanthine into purine nucleotides). cells were maintained in minimal essential medium, ␣ modification (hyclone), supplemented with 11% dialyzed fetal bovine serum.
the tracer medium consisted of defined minimal essential medium
(hyclone) that lacked glycine, serine, methionine, hypoxanthine, and
folate but was supplemented with 200 ␮m methionine, 20 nm 5-formylthf, 2 nm [3h]hypoxanthine, and 20 ␮m [14c]formate. cells were split
1:6 and grown in 6-well plates at 37 °c, 5% co2 in tracer medium until
confluent and harvested. the cell pellets were stored at ⫺40 °c. nuclear
dna was isolated using a dna blood kit from qiagen, and isotope
levels were quantified on a beckman ls6500 scintillation counter in
dual dpm mode. for hplc separation of nucleosides, cells were split
1:3 into tracer medium in 100-cm2 culture plates, grown to confluence,
and harvested. dna was digested to nucleosides prior to separation by
hplc, using procedures described elsewhere (28). peaks corresponding
to nucleosides were identified from standards, collected, and isotope
levels quantified.

accumulation. the human a222v polymorphic variant of the  xxxg1475xxx  gene encodes a thermolabile enzyme
with reduced ability to convert 5,10-methylene-thf to 5-methyl-thf
(32). the polymorphic allele impairs the accumulation of 5-methylthf in red blood cells in favor of formylated folates (33). human carriers of the a222v polymorphism also exhibit decreased folate content
in red blood cells (33). therefore, the ability to maintain cellular
5-methyl-thf concentrations may be an important determinant of
total cellular folate concentrations.
the effect of fdh-induced depletion of the 5-methyl-thf pool on
the homocysteine remethylation cycle was investigated by quantifying
cellular sam and sah concentrations (table 3). because 5-methylthf is necessary for folate-dependent homocysteine remethylation,
reduction in steady-state 5-methyl-thf concentrations may impair
sam synthesis (fig. 1). fdh expression at both high and low levels
reduced sam concentrations and the sam/sah ratio by 2-fold, indicating that the fdh-induced reduction in 5-methyl-thf and/or total
cellular folate concentrations impaired the homocysteine remethylation cycle and reduced the methylation potential (sam/sah ratio) of
the cell. this inhibitory effect of fdh on homocysteine remethylation is
a novel finding that was not anticipated.
effect of fdh expression on purine biosynthesis and cell growth—the
one-carbon unit of 10-formyl-thf supplies the c2 and c8 carbon for
de novo purine biosynthesis catalyzed by the enzymes 5⬘-phosphoribosylglycinamide transformylase and 5⬘-phosphoribosyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-n-succinocarboxamide transformylase (2). because fdh catalyzes the conversion of 10-formyl-thf to thf, it has been proposed
that increased fdh expression may impair cell growth by depleting the
supply of one-carbon units (in the form of 10-formyl-thf) for purine
biosynthesis. the effect of increased fdh expression on cell proliferation rates was examined in sh-sy5y. cell lines expressing the human
fdh cdna were cultured with defined ␣mem that lacked nucleosides,
nucleotides, serine, and glycine (fig. 4a). sh-sy5y cells expressing
fdh exhibited lower growth rates relative to nontransfected cells, indicating that increased levels of fdh marginally inhibited cell prolifera-

have been demonstrated to increase the average folate polyglutamate
chain length, because folate monoglutamates, which have a lower affinity for folate-binding proteins, are more susceptible to degradation (25).
effect of fdh expression on the distribution of folate one-carbon
derivatives and homocysteine remethylation—fdh has been proposed
to regulate the supply of folate-activated one carbon units by modulating the 10-formyl-thf/thf ratio. cellular folates are distributed
nearly equally in two compartments, the mitochondria and cytoplasm,
and these compartments are not in equilibrium (10). 10-formyl-thf is
the primary folate derivative found in the mitochondria of sh-sy5y
cells (24) and should not be available to fdh expressed in the cytoplasm. surprisingly, the low level of fdh expression in sh-sy5yfdh
cells increased the cellular formyl-thf/thf ratio by 10-fold compared
with sh-sy5y cells (table 2). formyl folates accounted for over 82% of
total cellular folates, and the relative levels of both thf and 5-methylthf were reduced by ⬃60% (table 2). in contrast, high fdh expression
decreased the 10-formyl-thf/thf ratio. thf accounted for over 46%
of total folate in sh-sy5yfdh⫹tet cells (table 2).
prior to these studies, two potentially contradictory metabolic roles
had been ascribed to fdh: 1) the removal of excess one-carbon units
from the folate-activated one-carbon pool by depleting 10-formyl-thf
pools (19), and 2) the generation of folate-activated one-carbons by
channeling thf to  xxxg2068xxx  and  xxxg1473xxx , two enzymes that catalyze
the synthesis of folate-activated one-carbon units (fig. 1). the results
from this study provide evidence that both of these metabolic roles may
be operative in cells depending on the expression level of fdh. low
levels of fdh expression increased the 10-formyl-thf/thf ratio,
consistent with a role for fdh in facilitating the generation of folateactivated one-carbon units. on the other hand, high levels of fdh
expression reduced dramatically the supply of folate activated onecarbon units such that thf became the primary cellular folate derivative. these results are consistent with the known physical properties of fdh. fdh exhibits a higher affinity for thf polyglutamates
(kd ⫽ 15 nm) than 10-formyl-thf polyglutamates (ks ⫽ 0.9 ␮m).
fdh, when expressed at low levels, is expected to bind cellular thf.
under these conditions, total fdh enzymatic activity is expected to
be lower compared with its thf-channeling activity to  xxxg1473xxx 
and  xxxg2068xxx . elevated levels of fdh expression provide additional
binding sites for 10-formyl-thf, leading to the depletion of
10-formyl-thf pools through the fdh-catalyzed conversion of
10-formyl-thf to thf (the specific activity of fdh exceeds the rate
of 10-formyl-thf synthesis). in summary, fdh can either generate
or remove folate-activated one-carbon units depending on its level of
expression.
both high and low fdh expression reduced the concentrations of
5-methyl-thf from 37% in nontransfected cells to ⬍8% in fdh-expressing cells (table 2). interestingly, other studies have demonstrated
that decreases in 5-methyl-thf concentrations impair cellular folate

tion in these cells (fig. 4a). the experiment was repeated using ␣mem
(containing purine nucleosides, serine, and glycine). the presence of
purine nucleosides in the culture medium did not rescue proliferation
rates in these cell lines; sh-sy5y cells expressing fdh exhibited lower
growth rates compared with nontransfected cells (fig. 4b). therefore,
expression of fdh in this sh-sy5y cell line affected cell growth, but the
observed fdh-induced growth inhibition did not result from the inhibition of de novo purine biosynthesis.
the effect of fdh expression on folate-dependent de novo purine
biosynthesis was determined directly using a formate-suppression
assay, which assesses the ability of the purine salvage pathway to suppress the incorporation of formate into purines through the de novo
pathway. in this experiment, cells are grown in the presence [14c]formate and [3h]hypoxanthine. [14c]formate is incorporated into
purine nucleotides through de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis,
which is folate-dependent, whereas [3h]hypoxanthine is incorporated into purine nucleotides through the salvage pathway (29). fdh
expression had no effect on the 14c/3h ratio in nuclear dna or
purine deoxynucleosides, demonstrating that, although fdh can
deplete 10-formyl-thf pools, this activity does not impair the incorporation of formate into purines (de novo purine biosynthesis) relative to
salvage pathway biosynthesis in neuroblastoma (table 4). recently, we
demonstrated that the enzyme methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase
(mthfs) is a high affinity 10-formyl-thf-binding protein and that
mthfs-bound 10-formyl-thf enhances rates of purine biosynthesis
relative to salvage pathway synthesis in sh-sy5y cells (29). mthfs
may bind and channel 10-formyl-thf to the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, thus protecting this pathway from fdh-mediated depletion of 10-formyl-thf pools.

effect of fdh expression on the flux of formate between the thymidylate and methionine biosynthetic pathways—to determine if shmt
or other folate-dependent reactions were compensating for the
fdh-induced depletions in 10-formyl-thf levels, the incorporation
of exogenously supplied [13c]formate into methionine and serine
(present in cellular protein), and purines (present in nuclear dna),
was determined in sh-sy5y cells as a function of fdh expression
(fig. 5 and table 5). the one-carbon precursor pools used for synthesis of purines, serine, and methionine can be derived either from
exogenous labeled formate or from endogenously synthesized unlabeled serine metabolites (fig. 5). surprisingly, fdh expression had
little effect on [13c]formate enrichments into methionine or serine
(table 5a). furthermore, fdh expression had little impact on the
enrichment of the 10-formyl-thf precursor pool used for purine
synthesis (table 5b). these results indicate that fdh expression
does not influence the enrichment of [13c]formate into the folateactivated one-carbon pool (fig. 5 and table 5b).
to establish directly the contribution of  xxxg2068xxx -derived one-carbon
units into the thymidine and methionine pools in the presence and
absence of fdh expression, metabolic isotope tracer experiments were
also performed using cells labeled with [l- xxxd2360xxx ]serine. methylene-thf
that is supplied by  xxxg2068xxx  and incorporated directly into methionine or
thymidine is expected to retain the two deuterium atoms (cd2) that are
present on the hydroxymethyl group of serine (fig. 5). alternatively, if
[l- xxxd2360xxx ]serine enters the mitochondria, the hydroxymethyl group will be
released from the mitochondrion as formate, and formate will contain a
single deuterium atom (cd1). previous isotope tracer studies have
shown that up to 90% of one-carbon units used for cytoplasmic folate
metabolism in mammalian cells are derived from formate generated by
mitochondrial serine metabolism (27). during the derivatization of serine for gc analysis, most of the serine is converted to dehydroalanine,
with loss of the proton at the c2 position (27). consequently, the m/z
distribution of dehydroalanine isotopes gives the isotopic distributions
at the c3 position of serine. table 6 shows that 73–77% of the isotopically labeled cellular serine pool that provided serine for protein synthesis retained both deuteriums on the c3 carbon (as assessed by dehydroalanine labeling). serine that contained one deuterium in the c3
position (⬃30%) was the result of serine that was resynthesized from
glycine using the cd1-thf pool (fig. 5). if the methionine and  xxxd3365xxx 
one-carbon units were only derived from  xxxg2068xxx , the mass ⫹2 species
of these metabolites should be ⬃70% of the labeled species. the data in
table 6 indicate that the proportions are much lower, demonstrating
that most of the one-carbon units used for cytoplasmic methionine and
 xxxd3365xxx  synthesis were derived from formate that originated from mitochondrial serine metabolism. previously, we have shown that in mcf-7

these studies examined several purported metabolic functions of
fdh in a cell culture model. as predicted from its in vitro activity, fdh
was demonstrated to affect the 10-formyl-thf pools in cells, but fdhinduced alterations in 10-formyl-thf levels did not impair de novo
purine biosynthesis or confer a purine requirement to these cells as has
been speculated. we also demonstrate that increased fdh expression
did not result in increased cellular folate accumulation in neuroblastoma, and therefore its folate tight-binding properties do not enable this
enzyme to serve as a reservoir for cellular folate. the results of this study
have identified a new and unanticipated metabolic role for fdh; both
5-methyl-thf and sam levels were sensitive to fdh expression level.
the effect of fdh on cellular methylation reactions warrants additional
study. neither the metabolic role of fdh within the folate-dependent
one-carbon network, nor its effects on total cellular folate content is
easily predicted from its catalytic, biochemical, or biophysical properties. furthermore, its physiological function and impact on one-carbon
metabolism and cellular folate content may vary in different cell types
and be dependent on the expression of other tissue-specific folate-dependent enzymes and binding proteins.
