abstract
 xxxd3154xxx  is a selective inhibitor of janus kinases
(jak) 1 and 2, which are involved in the signalling
pathway of various cytokines and growth factors essential to haematopoiesis. jak 1 and 2 are implicated
in the development of myelofibrosis, as well as other
haematological malignancies.  xxxd3154xxx  is the first
agent approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis.
in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
multicentre trial (comfort-i) in patients with
myelofibrosis, significantly more  xxxd3154xxx  than placebo recipients achieved a â€¡35% reduction in spleen
volume (primary endpoint) at 24 weeks. in a randomized, open-label, multicentre trial (comfortii) in patients with myelofibrosis, significantly more
 xxxd3154xxx  than best available therapy recipients
achieved the same primary endpoint at 48 weeks.
significantly more  xxxd3154xxx  than placebo recipients
achieved a â€¡50% reduction in total symptom score at
24 weeks in comfort-i.  xxxd3154xxx  generally improved health-related quality-of-life scores, while best
available therapy was generally associated with worsened scores at 48 weeks in comfort-ii. in comfort-i, overall survival data appeared to favour  xxxd3154xxx  over placebo; of note, most placebo recipients
had crossed over to receive  xxxd3154xxx . in comfortii, a significant difference in overall survival between
 xxxd3154xxx  and best available therapy was not shown;
this trial was not powered to detect such a difference.
in clinical trials in patients with myelofibrosis,
 xxxd3154xxx  was generally associated with an acceptable tolerability profile. in the placebo-controlled
trial, the most commonly reported grade 3 or 4 adverse
events in  xxxd3154xxx  recipients were thrombocytopenia, anaemia and neutropenia. these haematological adverse events were mainly managed with
dosage interruptions/reductions and/or transfusions,
and rarely resulted in discontinuation.

myeloproliferative neoplasms are clonal diseases
of the bone marrow.[1] there are eight types of clonal neoplasms within this class, including primary
myelofibrosis, polycythaemia vera and essential
thrombocythaemia,[2] which are collectively known
as philadelphia-negative classical myeloproliferative neoplasms.[1] myelofibrosis may also develop
following polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythaemia;[3] therefore, all mentions of myelofibrosis throughout this review refer to primary
myelofibrosis, post-polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis and post-essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis. acute myeloid leukaemia, while not a
member of this class, may evolve from a myeloproliferative neoplasm.[2]
myelofibrosis is a rare disease (with orphan
status in the us[4] and eu[5]) that predominantly
affects elderly patients.[6] although the natural
history is heterogeneous, myelofibrosis is characterized by progressive bone marrow fibrosis
and inadequate haematopoiesis, with substantial
cytopenias (especially anaemia), splenomegaly
and constitutional symptoms.[6] compared with
polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythaemia, primary myelofibrosis has the worst prognosis,
with death often a result of systemic infection
or fatal haemorrhage following bone marrow
failure.[1] the risk of transformation to an acute
leukaemia is also the highest with primary myelofibrosis.[1] in patients with primary myelofibrosis,
median survival varies according to international
prognostic scoring system (ipss) criteria, ranging
from 15 years in those with low risk to 2.2 years in
those with high risk.[7] corresponding 5-year survival rates range from 85% to 19%.[7]
the management of primary myelofibrosis
should be individualized, based on the patientâ€™s
ipss risk category and clinical need.[8-10] treatment
options range from observation in those with low

risk, to allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (asct)
or experimental drugs in those with high risk.[8-10]
while asct is the only curative treatment for
myelofibrosis, its use is limited by donor availability and treatment-related morbidity and mortality.[8] for patients requiring treatment and for
whom asct is not appropriate, therapy is often
restricted to palliative care. european leukemianet
lists corticosteroids, androgens, erythropoiesisstimulating agents and  xxxd371xxx  to
manage anaemia, and hydroxyurea for splenomegaly.[8] of note, none of these agents have been
approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis.[6]
although the molecular pathogenesis of myelofibrosis has not been fully elucidated, several
genetic mutations have been identified.[6,11] the
most common mutation (seen in Â»65% of patients
with primary myelofibrosis)[9] is the v617f substitution of the janus kinase (jak) 2, which results in constitutive activation of jak 2 and
aberrant downstream signalling.[12] jak and the
signal transducer and activator of transcription
(stat) are essential components of a signalling
pathway of diverse cytokines and other haematopoietic growth factors, and have important
roles in haematopoiesis.[13] the jak-stat signalling pathway is implicated in the development
of haematological malignancies, including myelofibrosis.[12,13] therefore, jak 2 was identified
as a candidate for targeted therapy, leading to the
development of jak inhibitors.[6,11] one such
inhibitor is  xxxd3154xxx  ( xxxd3154xxx ,  xxxd3154xxx );  xxxd3154xxx  is the first agent to be approved in the
us[14] or the eu[15] for the treatment of patients
with myelofibrosis. this article reviews the pharmacological properties of  xxxd3154xxx , and its clinical
profile in patients with myelofibrosis.
medical literature (including published and
unpublished data) on the use of  xxxd3154xxx  in myelofibrosis was identified by searching databases
since 1996 (including medline and embase),
bibliographies from published literature, clinical
trial registries/databases and websites (including
those of regional regulatory agencies and the manufacturer). additional information (including contributory unpublished data) was also requested
from the company developing the drug. searches
were last updated on 8 october 2012.

 xxxd3154xxx : adis drug profile

1. pharmacodynamic profile
  xxxd3154xxx  inhibited jak 2 in vitro, with
a mean half-maximal inhibitory concentration
(ic50) of 2.8 nmol/l.[16] the mean ic50 values of
 xxxd3154xxx  for other jak tyrosine kinases were
3.3 nmol/l for jak 1, 428 nmol/l for jak 3 and
19 nmol/l for  xxxg2364xxx ; mean ic50 values
for 26 other kinases were Â»100-fold greater than
those for jak 1 and 2.[16]
  xxxd3154xxx  inhibited stat3 phosphorylation (a marker of jak activity), as mediated by
interleukin (il)-6 (via jak 1) and  xxxg2282xxx  (via jak 2).[16] jak2v617f-positive cells
treated with  xxxd3154xxx  showed a reduction in
viability, growth and proliferation, and an increase in apoptosis.  xxxd3154xxx  also inhibited
the growth of erythroid and myeloid progenitor
cells obtained from patients with polycythaemia
vera.[16]
 levels of phosphorylated stat (pstat)
[usually absent in healthy individuals], were
decreased in a dose-dependent manner in patients
with myelofibrosis 2 hours after administration of
 xxxd3154xxx  10â€“100 mg;[17] pstat3 levels returned
to near baseline 10 hours after administration
of the drug.[14] after 4 weeks of treatment with
 xxxd3154xxx  25 mg twice daily, the mean pstat3
levels in these patients (n = 24) were reduced to
that seen in healthy volunteers.[17]
 in a mouse model of myeloproliferative neoplasms,[16] administration of  xxxd3154xxx  was associated with reductions in splenomegaly, circulating
levels of inflammatory cytokines (e.g. il-6 and
 xxxg2296xxx  [tnf]-a) and neoplastic
cell burden, as well as prolonged survival of the
animals.[16]
 in patients with myelofibrosis,[17-19]  xxxd3154xxx  therapy was associated with reductions in the
levels of inflammatory markers (such as il-6,
 xxxg2296xxx  and  xxxg520xxx ), and increases in
erythropoietin levels (a hormone that regulates
red blood cell production). these changes were
not observed in patients who received placebo[18]
or best available therapy.[19] it is thought that
inflammatory cytokines (such as il-6 and  xxxg2296xxx )
are responsible for the disease-related symptoms
seen in patients with myelofibrosis;[6] the effects

of  xxxd3154xxx  on these symptoms (and other
clinical endpoints) are discussed in section 3.
 in a placebo-controlled trial in patients with
myelofibrosis,[18] the jak2v617f allele burden
was significantly reduced (p Â£ 0.0002) from baseline at week 24 (by 10.9%) and week 48 (21.5%) in
 xxxd3154xxx  recipients, and was increased in placebo
recipients by 3.5% and 6.3% at weeks 24 and 48.
in another trial in patients with myelofibrosis,[19]
significantly more  xxxd3154xxx  recipients than best
available therapy recipients achieved a â€¡10% reduction in jak2v617f allele burden (41% vs
5%; p = 0.01) [abstract presentation].[20] in a noncomparative trial, the mean reduction in allele
burden was 13% after 12 months of  xxxd3154xxx 
therapy.[17]
 because jak 1 and jak 2 are involved in
cytokine signalling and haematopoiesis,[12] their
inhibition (with an agent such as  xxxd3154xxx )
carries a theoretical risk of cytopenia. although
no evidence of myelosuppressive or immunosuppressive effects were observed in animal studies,[16]
neutropenia was reported in healthy volunteers
who received  xxxd3154xxx .[21] haematological adverse events associated with the use of  xxxd3154xxx 
in patients with myelofibrosis are discussed in
section 4.
 there are no clinical data concerning resistance
to  xxxd859xxx  therapy; however, preclinical
studies have investigated potential mechanisms of
resistance, including point mutations in jak 2[22,23]
or jak 1,[23] and il-6 independence induced by
constitutive nuclear factor-kb activation.[24]
 single doses of  xxxd3154xxx  25 and 200 mg were
evaluated in a â€˜thorough qt studyâ€™ in healthy
volunteers, and did not prolong the corrected qt
interval.[14]
2. pharmacokinetic profile
 in healthy volunteers who received oral  xxxd3154xxx  15 mg every 12 hours,[21] the mean maximum
plasma concentration (cmax) was 649 nmol/l,
which was reached after a median time (tmax) of
1.5 hours; mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc) was 2610 nmol h/l.[21]
in patients with myelofibrosis who received
 xxxd3154xxx  at dosages of 10â€“50 mg twice daily or



drugs 2012; 72 (16)

2120

25â€“200 mg once daily, tmax was 1â€“3 hours.[17]
absorption of  xxxd3154xxx  was estimated to be
â€¡95% following oral administration of the drug.[14,25]
  xxxd3154xxx  cmax and auc increased linearly
with increasing dosage in healthy volunteers[21]
and in patients with myelofibrosis;[17] steady state
was reached by day 2.[21] there was minimal
(Â»10%) drug accumulation with administration
of  xxxd3154xxx  every 12 hours.[17]
 in healthy volunteers, administration of a
single dose of  xxxd3154xxx  20 mg with a high-fat
meal was bioequivalent to administration in the
fasting state.[21] therefore,  xxxd3154xxx  can be
given without regard to food.[14]
 the terminal-phase volume of distribution of
 xxxd3154xxx  was 76.6 l in healthy volunteers who
received repeated dosages of 15 mg every 12 hours;[21]
the steady-state apparent volume of distribution in patients with myelofibrosis was 53â€“65 l
( xxxd3154xxx  dosage not specified).[14]  xxxd3154xxx 
exhibited Â»97% binding to plasma proteins in vitro,
mainly to albumin.[14]
 in vitro studies indicate that cytochrome p450
(cyp) 3a4 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of  xxxd3154xxx , with two major and active
metabolites, m18 and m16/m27.[14,25] following
oral administration of [14c] xxxd3154xxx , the unchanged drug accounted for 57% of the total
radioactivity detected in the plasma, with 17%
attributed to m18 and 8.3% to m16/m27 (all other
detected metabolites accounted for <5% each).[25]
  xxxd3154xxx  is predominantly eliminated by
metabolism, with 74% of an administered dose
recovered in the urine and 22% recovered in the
faeces, mostly as metabolites.[14,25] in healthy
volunteers receiving  xxxd3154xxx  100 mg every 24
hours, 0.11% of the administered dose was
recovered as unchanged drug in the urine.[21]
unchanged drug accounted for <1% of the total
excreted radioactivity after administration of oral
[14c] xxxd3154xxx .[14,25] mean clearance of  xxxd3154xxx  15 mg every 12 hours in healthy volunteers
was 18.7 l/h.[21]
 the terminal elimination half-life (tÂ½) of  xxxd3154xxx  (given at various dosages) in patients with
myelofibrosis was 2â€“3 hours; mean tÂ½ was 2.8 hours
in healthy volunteers who received  xxxd3154xxx  15 mg
every 12 hours.[21]

special patient populations

 gender,[26] race[27] and weight[26] do not appear to
have a clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd3154xxx  (studies available as
abstracts).[26,27]
 although one study (available as an abstract)
reported no correlation between renal impairment
and the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd3154xxx ,[28] the drug is excreted mainly via the renal
route. thus, dosage adjustment may be required in
patients with renal impairment (see section 5).[14,15]
 because  xxxd3154xxx  auc and tÂ½ were increased
in recipients with hepatic impairment,[29] and because  xxxd3154xxx  is metabolized by hepatic enzymes,
dosage adjustment may also be required in patients
with hepatic impairment (see section 5).[14,15]
potential drug-drug interactions

 as  xxxd3154xxx  is primarily metabolized by
cyp3a4, the cyp3a4 inhibitors ketoconazole
and erythromycin and the cyp3a4 inducer
rifampicin (rifampin) have been shown to alter
 xxxd3154xxx  auc.[30] therefore, dosage adjustment may be required in patients receiving strong
cyp3a4 inhibitors (see section 5);[14,15] no dosage
adjustment is required in patients receiving mild
or moderate cyp3a4 inhibitors, such as
erythromycin.[14]
3. therapeutic efficacy
the clinical efficacy of  xxxd3154xxx  in patients
with myelofibrosis was evaluated in two comparative trials. these were a pivotal, phase iii,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
multicentre trial (comfort-i),[18] and a supporting, randomized, open-label, multicentre
trial (comfort-ii) with best available therapy
as the comparator.[19]
enrolled patients had primary myelofibrosis,
post-polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis or postessential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis that
required treatment; patients in comfort-i
were resistant or refractory to available treatment,[18] and patients in comfort-ii were not
candidates for asct.[19] key inclusion criteria included age â€¡18 years, life expectancy of â€¡6 months,
drugs 2012; 72 (16)

at baseline, the median age of patients was
66â€“70 years; 45â€“55% of patients had primary
myelofibrosis, 27â€“33% had post-polycythaemia
vera myelofibrosis and 14â€“23% had post-essential
thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis; 35â€“41% were
ipss intermediate-2 risk and 58â€“64% were high
risk; 67â€“80% were positive for the jak2v617f
mutation; median of the palpable spleen below the
left costal margin was 14â€“16 cm; median spleen
volume was 2318â€“2598 cm3; and 57â€“75% had previously received hydroxyurea therapy.[18,19]

ipss risk of intermediate-2 or higher, eastern cooperative oncology group performance status of
Â£3, palpable spleen of â€¡5 cm below the left costal
margin, peripheral blast count of <10% and platelet count of â€¡100 Â· 109/l.[18,19]
key exclusion criteria included absolute neutrophil count of Â£1 Â· 109/l, a history of malignancy (except treated basal or squamous cell
carcinoma of the skin) in the previous 5 years,
inadequate hepatic or renal function, and splenic
irradiation in the previous 12 months.[18,19]
in both trials,[18,19] the starting dosage in the
 xxxd3154xxx  groups was 15 or 20 mg twice daily, based
on baseline platelet count (i.e. 100â€“200 Â· 109/l, or
>200 Â· 109/l). the dosage could be adjusted to
5â€“25 mg twice daily, based on efficacy and tolerability requirements, as well as platelet count at
the time of dosage adjustment. patients were to
receive treatment for 24[18] or 48[19] weeks, after
which time cross over from placebo[18] or best
available therapy[19] to  xxxd3154xxx  (or continuation of  xxxd3154xxx  therapy) was permitted. early
unblinding in patients not receiving  xxxd3154xxx 
(i.e. placebo[18] or best available therapy[19]) and
cross over to  xxxd3154xxx  therapy was permitted
if spleen volume had increased by â€¡25% of baseline (comfort-i)[18] or by >25% of nadir
(comfort-ii).[19] in comfort-ii,[19] the
most commonly given best available therapies were
hydroxyurea (46.6% of patients) and prednisone/
prednisolone (12.3%).

compared with placebo

 in comfort-i, a significantly greater proportion of  xxxd3154xxx  recipients than placebo
recipients achieved a â€¡35% reduction in spleen
volume at 24 weeks (odds ratio [or] 134.4; 95%
ci 18.0, 1004.9) [primary endpoint; table i].[18]
 although a reduction in spleen volume in
 xxxd3154xxx  recipients was reported in comforti, with an increase in placebo recipients, no statistical analysis was reported for the between-group
comparison (table i).[18] a reduction in spleen
volume was seen across all subgroups of  xxxd3154xxx 
recipients, which were based on myelofibrosis
subtype[18] and jak2v617f mutation status (no
statistical analyses reported).[18] the reduction in
spleen volume in  xxxd3154xxx  recipients was first
observed at week 12, the first assessment timepoint
for this endpoint.[18]

general scores). recipients of best available therapy had worsened scores. statistical comparisons
were not reported for these endpoints.[19]
 at a median follow up of 12 months,[19] the
proportion of patients with progression events
was 30% with  xxxd3154xxx  and 26% with best available therapy (hr 0.81; 95% ci 0.47, 1.39); the
proportion of patients who died was 4% with
 xxxd3154xxx  and 5% with best available therapy. the
hr for leukaemia-free survival was 0.65 (95% ci
0.18, 2.31) and for overall survival was 0.70 (95%
ci 0.20, 2.49). after another Â»2 months (median
61.1 weeks), the proportion of deaths was 8% with
 xxxd3154xxx  and 5% with best available therapy (hr
1.01; 95% ci 0.32, 3.24). of note, although no
statistical significance between the treatment groups
was shown for these survival endpoints, the trial was
not powered to detect such differences. in addition, at the later follow-up, Â»25% of best available
therapy recipients had already crossed over to
 xxxd3154xxx  therapy.[19]

4. tolerability
the tolerability data of  xxxd3154xxx  discussed in
this section were obtained from two randomized
trials in patients with myelofibrosis[18,19] (see section 3 for trial design details), the us prescribing
information[14] and long-term follow-up[31,32] of a
non-comparative study.[17]
  xxxd3154xxx  had a generally acceptable tolerability profile in patients with myelofibrosis.[18,19]
the most common adverse events (incidence
>20%) of any grade observed in  xxxd3154xxx  or
placebo recipients in comfort-i[18] were anaemia (96.1% vs 86.8%), thrombocytopenia (69.7%
vs 30.5%), fatigue (25.2% vs 33.8%), diarrhoea
(23.2% vs 21.2%), bruising (23.2% vs 14.6%) and
peripheral oedema (18.7% vs 22.5). in comfort-ii[19] in  xxxd3154xxx  or best available therapy
recipients, the most common adverse events
(incidence >20%) of any grade were haemoglobin
abnormalities (96% vs 94%), platelet count abnormalities (68% vs 29%), diarrhoea (23% vs
12%) and peripheral oedema (22% vs 26%). the
us prescribing information[14] also lists dizziness
(18.1% vs 7.3%) and headache (14.8% vs 5.3%)
among the most common non-haematological
adverse events in  xxxd3154xxx  and placebo recipients in comfort-i.[18]
 as with adverse events of all grades, the most
common grade 3 or 4 adverse events in  xxxd3154xxx 
recipients were haematological in nature (i.e.
anaemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia)
[table ii]. the incidence of these adverse events
was related to  xxxd3154xxx  dosage.[14] aside from
these haematological adverse events and fatigue,
all other grade 3 or 4 adverse events had an incidence of Â£3% in the  xxxd3154xxx  groups (table ii).
in  xxxd3154xxx  recipients, there was one case of
grade 3 bruising[18] and no grade 3 or 4 peripheral
oedema.[18,19]
 in comfort-ii,[19] the most common
serious adverse events (incidence >3%) in  xxxd3154xxx  recipients were anaemia (5%), and in best
available therapy recipients were pneumonia

(5%), anaemia (4%), and dyspnoea (4%). adverse
events leading to discontinuation were reported
in 11.0% of  xxxd3154xxx  versus 10.6% of placebo
recipients in comfort-i,[18] and in 8% of
 xxxd3154xxx  versus 5% of best available therapy
recipients in comfort-ii.[19]
 although common, anaemia and thrombocytopenia were managed with dosage modifications and/or transfusions of packed red blood
cells, and generally did not lead to study discontinuation.[18,19] adverse events of any grade
requiring dosage reductions or interruptions occurred in 63% of  xxxd3154xxx  recipients and in 15%
of best available therapy recipients; these included thrombocytopenia (41% vs 1%), anaemia
(5% vs 1%) and neutropenia (1% vs 0%).[19] in
comfort-i,[18] one  xxxd3154xxx  and one placebo
recipient discontinued because of anaemia, and
one in each group because of thrombocytopenia;
in comfort-ii,[19] one  xxxd3154xxx  and one best
available therapy recipient discontinued because
of thrombocytopenia.
 the median time to the onset of anaemia of at
least grade 2 severity was Â»6 weeks in both
trials.[14] in comfort-i, 60% of  xxxd3154xxx

and 38% of placebo recipients received red blood
cell transfusions (median number was 1.2 and
1.7 units/month).[14] in comfort-ii,[19] at least
one transfusion was received in 51% of  xxxd3154xxx  and 38% of best available therapy recipients
(mean number was 0.86 and 0.91 units/month). in
 xxxd3154xxx  recipients in comfort-ii,[19] mean
haemoglobin levels were 109.3 g/l at baseline,
nadir of 94.1 g/l at Â»14 weeks, and then 101.8 g/l
at week 24. a similar pattern of change in haemoglobin levels was also seen in  xxxd3154xxx  recipients
in comfort-i,[18] regardless of transfusional
requirements.[14]
 in both trials, the median time to the onset of
grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was Â»8 weeks.[14]
recovery of platelet counts to >50 Â· 109/l was
14 days after  xxxd3154xxx  dosage reduction or interruption. platelet transfusions were received by
4.7% of  xxxd3154xxx  and 4.0% of control recipients. of note, patients with a baseline platelet
count of 100â€“200 Â· 109/l, compared with those with
a baseline count of >200 Â· 109/l, had a numerically higher incidence of grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (16.5% vs 7.2%).[14] grade 3 bleeding
was reported in 2.6% of  xxxd3154xxx  and 2.0% of
placebo recipients; grade 4 bleeding occurred in
1.3% of patients in both groups.[18]
 patients may experience a recurrence of myelofibrosis symptoms after interruption or discontinuation of  xxxd3154xxx , which generally returned
to baseline levels after Â»1 week.[14] in comfort-i,[18] grade â€¡3 adverse events were reported
in 16.3% of  xxxd3154xxx  and 13.0% of placebo
recipients after dosage interruption, and in 57.1%
of  xxxd3154xxx  and 45.9% of placebo recipients
after discontinuation; no clear pattern of a specific withdrawal effect was observed. in comfort-ii,[19] 19 (59.4%) of the 32  xxxd3154xxx 
recipients who discontinued reported adverse events
within 2 weeks of discontinuation, and included
six patients with at least one myelofibrosis-related
adverse event (including grade 3 general deterioration in physical health, pyrexia and fatigue).
long-term follow-up (from a single institution of
a phase i/ii trial [n = 51]) have suggested that
some patients with myelofibrosis may experience
adverse events after discontinuation of  xxxd3154xxx , possibly attributed to the rapid rise in

inflammatory cytokine activity.[31,32] therefore,
dosage tapering is recommended for discontinuation for reasons other than thrombocytopenia.[14]
 numerically more  xxxd3154xxx  than placebo
recipients experienced newly occurring or worsening grade 1 abnormalities in alt (25.2% vs 7.3%)
or ast (17.4% vs 6.0%) levels or newly occurring
or worsening grade 1 elevations in cholesterol
levels (16.8% vs 0.7%).[14] in  xxxd3154xxx  recipients, 1.9%, 1.3% and 0% of patients had grade 2,
3 or 4 elevations in alt levels, respectively,
0.6%, 0% and 0% had grade 2, 3 or 4 elevations in
ast levels, respectively, and 0.6%, 0% and 0%
had grade 2, 3 or 4 elevations of cholesterol levels,
respectively.[14]
5. dosage and administration
oral  xxxd3154xxx  is indicated in the us and the
eu for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis;[14,15] it is specifically approved for use in
patients with intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis in the us.[14] as decisions on the most
appropriate dosage often needs to take into account platelet count, this parameter should be
determined prior to starting  xxxd3154xxx  treatment, monitored every 2â€“4 weeks until the dosage
is stabilized, and re-assessed thereafter when
clinically required.[14,15]
the recommended starting dosage of  xxxd3154xxx 
differs according to patient characteristics and
platelet count. in both the us and the eu, the
recommended starting dosage of  xxxd3154xxx  is
15 mg twice daily in patients with a platelet count of
100â€“200 Â· 109/l and 20 mg twice daily in patients
with a platelet count of >200 Â· 109/l.[14,15]
in terms of special patient populations, us
prescribing information recommends a starting
dosage of  xxxd3154xxx  10 mg twice daily in patients
who have a platelet count of 100â€“150 Â· 109/l in
addition to hepatic impairment or moderate to
severe renal impairment, and in patients who have
a platelet count of â€¡100 Â· 109/l in addition to
treatment with a strong cyp3a4 inhibitor (e.g.
boceprevir, clarithromycin,  xxxd1747xxx , grapefruit juice, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole,
lopinavir/ritonavir,  xxxd2638xxx , nefazodone, nelfinavir,  xxxd2986xxx , ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir,
drugs 2012; 72 (16)

 xxxd3154xxx : adis drug profile

telithromycin,  xxxd3528xxx ).[14] us prescribing information also recommends that use of  xxxd3154xxx 
be avoided in patients who have a platelet count
of <100 Â· 109/l in addition to hepatic impairment,
moderate to severe renal impairment or receiving
treatment with a strong cyp3a4 inhibitor, and in
those with end-stage renal disease (creatinine clearance [clcr] <15 ml/min) not requiring dialysis.[14]
the eu summary of product characteristics
states that no dosage adjustment is needed in
patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.[15] however, the starting dosage of  xxxd3154xxx  should be reduced by Â»50% (administered
twice daily) in patients with hepatic impairment,
severe renal impairment (clcr <30 ml/min) or
in those receiving strong cyp3a4 inhibitors or
dual cyp3a4 and cyp2c9 inhibitors.[15]
among patients in both the us and the eu
who have end-stage renal disease and are undergoing dialysis, a starting dosage of  xxxd3154xxx 
15 mg is recommended in those with a platelet
count of 100â€“200 Â· 109/l, and  xxxd3154xxx  20 mg is
recommended in those with a platelet count of
>200 Â· 109/l; single doses should be administered only on dialysis days, after each dialysis
session.[14,15]
 xxxd3154xxx  may be administered with or without food.[14,15] for patients who are not able to ingest the tablets,  xxxd3154xxx  may be administered via
a nasogastric tube.[14] in all patients, the  xxxd3154xxx 
dosage may be adjusted according to tolerability
and efficacy; for example, a dosage interruption or
reduction may be required to manage thrombocytopenia.[14,15] the maximum recommended  xxxd3154xxx  dosage is 25 mg twice daily.[14,15]
the local manufacturerâ€™s prescribing information should be consulted for full details on
contraindications, warnings, precautions, dosage
adjustments, use in special patient populations,
drug-drug interactions and patient monitoring
recommendations.
6.  xxxd3154xxx : current status
 xxxd3154xxx  is the first agent to be approved in
the us and the eu for the treatment of myelofibrosis. in the us,  xxxd3154xxx  is approved for the
treatment of patients with intermediate- or highadis Âª 2012 springer international publishing ag. all rights reserved.

risk myelofibrosis, including primary myelofibrosis,
post-polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis and postessential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis. in the
eu,  xxxd3154xxx  is approved for the treatment
of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in
adult patients with primary myelofibrosis, postpolycythaemia vera myelofibrosis and post-essential
thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis.
in two randomized trials, significantly more
patients receiving  xxxd3154xxx  than placebo or best
available therapy achieved a â€¡35% reduction in
spleen volume at 24[18,19] and/or 48[19] weeks.  xxxd3154xxx  therapy generally improved symptom
and health-related quality-of-life scores in these
trials.[18,19] overall survival data favoured  xxxd3154xxx  over placebo in comfort-i;[18] of note,
the majority of placebo recipients had crossed
over to receive  xxxd3154xxx  at the time of the
overall survival analysis. in comfort-ii,[19] a
significant difference between  xxxd3154xxx  and
best available therapy was not shown for overall
survival; this trial was not powered to detect such
a difference.
the tolerability of  xxxd3154xxx  was generally
acceptable in both clinical trials, with the most
common (and dosage-dependent) haematological
adverse events manageable in the majority of
patients with dosage interruptions/reductions
and/or transfusions.[18,19]
while the long-term efficacy and safety, as
well as disease-modifying potential, of  xxxd3154xxx 
remains to be seen, the drug undoubtedly provides benefits in patients with myelofibrosis,[10]
such as reducing splenomegaly and improving
disease-related symptoms and health-related quality of life. a number of trials have been planned or
are currently underway to evaluate  xxxd3154xxx  in
patients with myelofibrosis and platelet count of
50â€“100 Â· 109/l,[33,34] or patients with myelofibrosis
who are treatment naive or who are intolerant of,
or had progressed on, any prior therapy.[35]
