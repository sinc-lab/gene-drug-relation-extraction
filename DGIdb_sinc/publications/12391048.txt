between the air space
and capillary compartments in the distal air spaces of
the lung involves transport across epithelial, interstitial, and endothelial barriers. the tight epithelium of
the alveolus and distal airways provides the principal
permeability barrier and carries out the active absorption of excess fluid from the air spaces (10, 15, 29). the
alveolar epithelium, which occupies the majority of the
distal air space surface, contains type i and type ii

movement of solutes and water

epithelial cells. cell culture experiments indicate that
type ii cells are able to transport na⫹ and cl⫺ utilizing
luminal epithelial na⫹ channels (enac) and possibly
cftr cl⫺ channels and basolateral membrane
na⫹-k⫹ pumps (16, 20, 21, 27). less information is
available about the physiology of type i cells because
suitable cell culture models are not available; however,
measurements in freshly isolated immunopurified type
i cells indicate that they are highly water permeable
(9) and may contain enac (22). distal airways are
moderately water permeable (12), and, although little
information is available, they are thought to carry out
rapid fluid transport as do epithelial cells in the larger
proximal airways (1, 3, 5, 23, 28).
intact lung preparations have been used to measure
salt and water transport across the distal air space
barrier (13, 29). the air space is generally filled with
fluid containing a radiolabeled volume marker such as
125
i-albumin, and fluid movement into or out of the air
space compartment is deduced from changes in volume
marker concentration in air space fluid samples. there
is a considerable body of data showing that fluid is
absorbed isotonically from the air space compartment
by an amiloride-sensitive, active fluid transport process that is stimulated by camp agonists (10, 29).
rapid, osmotically driven water transport across the
air space-capillary barrier was originally demonstrated in perfused sheep lung from the rate of osmotic
equilibration after instillation of hyperosmolar fluid
into the air spaces (13). ion transport in intact lung has
been measured from the disappearance of radioactive
22
na⫹ and 36cl⫺ from instilled air space fluid (11, 32).
utilizing volume marker and tracer uptake methods, it
was reported recently that camp-stimulated fluid absorption and cl⫺ transport out of the air space fluid in
mouse lung were inhibited by  xxxd2215xxx  and cftr
gene deletion, suggesting the involvement of cftr in
distal lung cl⫺ transport (11). however, a concern in
the use of volume markers and radioactive labels is
that invasive air space fluid sampling is required,

10.1152/japplphysiol.00562.2002.—we developed a pleural
surface fluorescence method to measure na⫹ and cl⫺ transport in perfused mouse lungs. the air space was filled with
aqueous fluid containing membrane-impermeant fluorescent
indicators of cl⫺ (lucigenin) or na⫹ (sodium green). after
instillation of a cl⫺-free solution into the air space, an increase in perfusate cl⫺ concentration from 0 to 30 mm
produced a decrease in surface lucigenin fluorescence (6.5%/
min) corresponding to cl⫺ influx of 1.0 mm/min. cl⫺ influx
was increased to 2.1 ⫾ 0.3 mm/min by  xxxd1742xxx , and the
increase was inhibited by  xxxd2215xxx . camp-stimulated
cl⫺ influx was decreased by 57% in cftr null mice. after
instillation of a na⫹-free solution into the air space, an
increase in perfusate na⫹ concentration from 0 to 30 mm
gave increased sodium green fluorescence (na⫹ influx of 1.2
mm/min), which increased approximately fivefold after
camp agonists. cl⫺ and na⫹ transport were not affected in
lungs from mice lacking aquaporins  xxxg180xxx  or aqp5. our
results establish a pleural surface fluorescence method to
measure unidirectional cl⫺ and na⫹ flux in intact lung and
provide evidence for camp-stimulated transcellular cl⫺ and
na⫹ transport.

pleural surface fluorescence measurements. air space fluid
fluorescence was measured by a pleural surface fluorescence
method, as modified from our laboratory’s previous method
for measurement of lung water transport (6, 7). the heart
and lungs were positioned in a perfusion chamber for observation by epifluorescence microscopy. lucigenin (50 ␮m, molecular probes) or sodium green (20 ␮m, molecular probes)
was added to the air space fluid as indicators of cl⫺ or na⫹,
respectively. the fluorescence from a 3- to 5-mm-diameter
spot on the lung pleural surface was monitored continuously
with an inverted epifluorescence microscope using a ⫻10 air
objective (leitz, numerical aperture of 0.25) and filter set
containing 470 ⫾ 15-nm (for lucigenin) or 490 ⫾ 15-nm (for
sodium green) excitation filter, 510-nm dichroic mirror, and
⬎530-nm cut-on filter. signals were detected by a photomultiplier, amplified, digitized, and recorded at a rate of 1 hz.
cl⫺ transport measurements. the pulmonary artery was
first perfused with cl⫺ free solution (solutions a or e, see
table 1) until the lungs became white. air (0.5 ml) was
injected into the air space with the lungs submersed under
water to confirm that the lung was intact. after deflation, 0.5
ml of isosmolar fluid containing 50 ␮m lucigenin were infused into the air space, and the trachea was sutured closed.
the total time for lung preparation from chest incision to
fluorescence measurements was 10–15 min. the heart-lung
block was positioned on the microscope stage, and a fluorescence baseline was recorded. the perfusate was then
switched to a cl⫺-containing solution (solution c). in some
experiments, the perfusate and instillate contained amiloride
(100 ␮m),  xxxd2215xxx  (100 ␮m), or bumetanide (100 ␮m),
or the perfusate contained  xxxd2388xxx  (200 ␮m) and  xxxd1742xxx  (20
␮m). some experiments were done using na⫹-free solutions
(solutions e and f), or k⫹-free solutions in which k⫹ was
replaced by na⫹.
na⫹ transport measurements. after lung preparation as
described above, 0.5 ml of an isosmolar na⫹-free solution
(solution b) containing 20 ␮m sodium green were instilled
into the air spaces. the pulmonary artery was perfused with
the same na⫹-free solution for 5 min and then switched to a
na⫹-containing solution (solution d). in some experiments,
the instillate and/or perfusate contained  xxxd1742xxx / xxxd2388xxx ,
amiloride, or  xxxd2215xxx  at the concentrations given
above. some experiments were done using cl⫺-free solutions
in the instillate and perfusate (solutions g and h).

which limits the number of samples that can be obtained in each experiment (generally 1–2 samples in
mouse lung) and introduces uncertainties due to contamination of samples by fluid in proximal airways.
our laboratory previously introduced a pleural surface fluorescence method to measure osmotic water
transport continuously in perfused lungs (6). the air
space was filled with a fluorescent volume marker
whose concentration (proportional to air space fluid
osmolality) was deduced from the fluorescence signal
at the pleural surface. osmotic water permeability was
measured from the time course of pleural surface fluorescence in response to changes in osmolality of the
pulmonary artery perfusate. the pleural surface fluorescence method was used to quantify changes in lung
water permeability near the time of birth (8) and to
determine the role of aquaporin water channels  xxxg180xxx ,
aqp4, and aqp5 in lung water permeability utilizing
knockout mice (2, 24, 35). an interesting observation
was that reduction of lung water permeability by ⬎30fold by aquaporin deletion had no effect on active fluid
absorption from the distal air spaces (24).
the purpose of this study was to develop and apply
pleural surface fluorescence methods to measure the
transport of cl⫺ and na⫹ into the air space compartment in perfused mouse lung. membrane-impermeant
fluorescent indicators of cl⫺ and na⫹ were introduced
into the fluid-filled air space compartment to measure
cl⫺ ([cl⫺]) and na⫹ concentrations ([na⫹]) continuously in response to changes in perfusate ionic composition, addition of transporter agonists or inhibitors, or
gene knockout. fluorescent indicators were selected
with bright, long-wavelength fluorescence and with
high sensitivities to cl⫺ and na⫹. the new methods
were validated by analysis of air space fluid samples
and applied to characterize the mechanisms of cl⫺ and
na⫹ transport across the distal air space barrier in
mouse lung. measurements were also made in cftr
null (cystic fibrosis) mice to analyze the role of cftr in
distal lung salt transport, and in aquaporin null mice
to test whether  xxxg180xxx  or aqp5 deletion in lung induces
compensatory changes in functional salt transporters.

assay of na and cl in air space fluid samples. to
validate fluorescence measurements, in some experiments
air space fluid samples were obtained and assayed for [cl⫺]
or [na⫹]. lungs were isolated, the pulmonary artery was
perfused, and the air space was filled with 0.5 ml of fluid as
described above. fluid samples (20 ␮l) were withdrawn at
specified times using pe-90 tubing attached to a 1-ml syringe. for each fluid sample, the initial 20 ␮l withdrawn were
discarded. [cl⫺] was assayed using a dual-wavelength fluorescence method as described previously (36), and [na⫹] was
measured by flame photometry.
results

for measurement of cl⫺ and na⫹ transport into the
fluid-filled air space compartment, ion-selective indicators were chosen that were membrane impermeant and
had bright, long-wavelength fluorescence, ph insensitivity, and sensitivity to cl⫺ and na⫹ in a concentration range appropriate for transport measurements in
perfused lung preparations. because of the relatively
slow rates of ion transport in lung, estimated from 36cl
and 22na measurements in mouse lung to be ⬃0.7%/
min equilibration in response to air space-capillary
gradients of [cl⫺] or [na⫹] (11), experiments were
designed to measure ion influx using highly [cl⫺]- and
[na⫹]-sensitive indicators in the air space fluid. figure

sensitivities to [cl⫺] and [na⫹], respectively. both indicators are highly polar and have bright, long-wavelength, ph-insensitive fluorescence. lucigenin fluores-

cence is also insensitive to cation composition and to
the anions sulfate, phosphate, and no3⫺ (4), as well as
hco3⫺ in the range 0–30 mm. sodium green fluorescence is insensitive to anion composition and to the
cations choline⫹ and n-methylglucamine⫹ (nmg⫹)
and has a na⫹-to-k⫹ selectivity ratio of ⬃40 (39).
cl⫺ transport into the fluid-filled air space compartment was measured from the time course of air space
fluid lucigenin fluorescence, measured at the pleural
surface, in response to an increase in pulmonary artery
perfusate [cl⫺]. the pulmonary artery was initially
perfused with a cl⫺-free isosmolar solution (no3⫺ replacing cl⫺), and the air space was instilled with the
same solution but contained lucigenin. figure 2a
shows that cl⫺ addition to the perfusate produced a
slow decrease in lucigenin fluorescence whose initial
slope depended on perfusate [cl⫺]. in some experiments, there was a slow decrease in fluorescence (0.8–
1.5%/min), even in the absence of cl⫺, which weakly
depended on illumination intensity and probably corresponds to a combination of photobleaching and slow
dye leakage out of the air space compartment. computed rates of cl⫺ influx (after correction for dye photobleaching/leakage) were approximately linear with
[cl⫺]: 0.8, 1.8, and 3.0 mm/min for perfusate [cl⫺] of
30, 60, and 120 mm, respectively.
figure 2b shows a confocal micrograph of the pleural
surface of a lung containing lucigenin in the air space
compartment, prepared for functional studies as in fig.
2a. fluorescence was seen in the fluid-filled air spaces

with dark septa separating alveoli. selective air space
fluid staining was seen for ⬎1 h in the perfused lung
preparation. occasionally seen microvessels were nonfluorescent. to validate the accuracy of [cl⫺] measurements, in some studies air space fluid samples were
obtained at 0, 1, 2, and 5 min and assayed for [cl⫺].
figure 2c shows an approximately linear increase in
perfusate [cl⫺] over 5 min, with an influx rate (slope)
of 0.9 mm/min, in good agreement with the influx rate
of 1.0 ⫾ 0.1 mm/min determined from the lucigenin
pleural surface fluorescence measurements (computed
using eq. 4).
the pleural surface fluorescence method was used to
study cl⫺ transporting mechanisms. figure 3a, first
curve, shows that, after addition of 30 mm cl⫺ to the
perfusate, camp stimulation by  xxxd1742xxx  and  xxxd2388xxx 
produced a significantly increased negative slope of the
fluorescence vs. time curve, indicating more rapid cl⫺
influx. cl⫺ influx increased from 1.0 ⫾ 0.1 mm/min
before to 2.1 ⫾ 0.3 mm/min after  xxxd1742xxx  addition
(averaged data summarized in fig. 3b). the increase
in slope was blocked by inclusion of 100 ␮m  xxxd2215xxx  in the instillate and perfusates throughout the
experiment (second curve). experiments were done to
deduce whether cl⫺ transport into the air space compartment was accompanied by cation entry and/or
no3⫺ exit (to maintain electroneutrality). there was no

metanide (not shown), providing evidence for cl⫺/no3⫺
exchange as the primary mechanism for cl⫺ entry into
the air space fluid in these experiments. this conclusion was supported by the finding that na⫹ replacement by the relatively impermeant cation nmg⫹
(fourth curve) in the instillate and perfusates had little
effect on the rates of cl⫺ entry before or after  xxxd1742xxx 
addition. also, cl⫺ entry was not affected by reduction
of perfusate [k⫹] to zero (k⫹ replaced by nmg⫹) (influx rate 0.77 ⫾ 0.14 mm/min), providing evidence
against k⫹-cl⫺ cotransport.
na⫹ transport into the fluid-filled air space compartment was measured by a similar approach in which the
pulmonary artery was initially perfused with na⫹-free
isosmolar solution, and the air space was instilled with
the same solution but containing sodium green. figure 4a shows that the addition of na⫹ to the perfusate
resulted in an increase in fluorescence. as done for cl⫺,
the accuracy of [na⫹] measurements was validated by
[na⫹] assays on air space fluid samples. the rate of
na⫹ influx measured by fluorescence in response to a
30 mm na⫹ gradient, 1.2 ⫾ 0.3 (se) mm/min (4 lungs,
j appl physiol • vol

computed from eq. 7), agreed with na⫹ influx measured in fluid samples, 0.8 mm/min (3 lungs).
na⫹ transporting mechanisms were studied by using
transport agonists, inhibitors, and ion substitution.
figure 4b (first curve) shows that camp stimulation by
 xxxd1742xxx  and  xxxd2388xxx  produced an increase in slope
corresponding to an increased rate of na⫹ influx from
1.2 ⫾ 0.3 mm/min (just before camp agonist addition)
to 5.9 ⫾ 0.7 mm/min (averaged data summarized in
fig. 4c). inclusion of amiloride in the instillate and
perfusates throughout the experiment (second curve)
had no significant effect on basal na⫹ influx but significantly inhibited camp-stimulated na⫹ influx. in
these experiments, na⫹ was substituted by nmg⫹, a
relatively membrane-impermeant cation. substitution
of na⫹ by choline⫹, a commonly used membrane-impermeant cation, resulted in progressive dye leakage
and increased pulmonary vascular resistance, suggesting toxicity to the lung. we note that, unlike the situation for cl⫺/no3⫺ substitution, there is not suitable
membrane-permeant cation for na⫹ replacement. to
determine whether na⫹ entry into the air space fluid
was accompanied by transcellular transport of cl⫺ to
maintain electroneutrality, effects of  xxxd2215xxx 
and cl⫺ replacement by gluconate⫺ were studied. inclusion of  xxxd2215xxx  (fig. 4b, third curve) partially
inhibited camp-stimulated na⫹ influx, consistent with
the  xxxd2215xxx  inhibition of cl⫺ influx (see fig. 3)
and the need for cl⫺ entry to maintain electroneutrality. replacement of cl⫺ by the relatively impermeant
anion gluconate⫺ (fourth curve) produced stronger inhibition of camp-stimulated na⫹ influx.
measurements of na⫹ and cl⫺ transport were carried out in lungs of  xxxg180xxx  and aqp5 null mice to test
the hypothesis that aquaporin deletion causes an upregulation of ion transporters to compensate for reduced air space-capillary water permeability. our laboratory found previously that deletion of these
aquaporins did not affect active fluid absorption from
the distal air spaces, even when fluid absorption was
maximally stimulated by camp agonists and type ii
cell upregulation by keratinocyte growth factor (24).
figure 5a, left, shows that air space-capillary osmotic
water permeability, measured by a pleural surface
fluorescence method using fitc-dextran as a volume
indicator (6), was reduced ⬃10-fold by  xxxg180xxx  or aqp5
deletion. figure 5a, right, is a control study showing
that air space fluid volume, assessed by pleural surface
fitc-dextran fluorescence, was not changed significantly under the ion substitution conditions used for
measurement of cl⫺ and na⫹ influx. figure 5b shows
representative data for cl⫺ and na⫹ influx into the air
space fluid using the experimental protocols established in figs. 3 and 4. influx rates were qualitatively
similar, with preservation of camp agonist stimulation. the averaged data summarized in fig. 5c show
no effect of  xxxg180xxx  or aqp5 deletion on basal or simulated cl⫺ or na⫹ transport across the distal air space
barrier in mouse lung.
inhibition of camp-stimulated cl⫺ transport by  xxxd2215xxx  (fig. 3) suggested the involvement of cftr

in this process, although  xxxd2215xxx  may also affect
other cl⫺ transporters as well as k⫹ transporters at
concentrations needed to inhibit cftr (33). measurements of cl⫺ transport in cystic fibrosis (cftr null)
mice were done to investigate the role of cftr in basal
and camp-stimulated cl⫺ entry into the air space fluid
compartment. cl⫺ entry studies (as in fig. 3b, first
curve) were done in a series of matched wild-type (fig.
6a, left) and cftr null (right) mice. in nearly all
wild-type mice, camp elevation produced a marked
increase in the rate of cl⫺ entry, as seen from the
increased slope after  xxxd1742xxx / xxxd2388xxx  addition. in
many, but not all, cftr null mice, there was little or
no camp-stimulated cl⫺ entry. figure 6b summarizes
rates of cl⫺ entry before and after camp stimulation.
cftr deletion in mice caused on average a small
increase in basal cl⫺ influx and a decrease in campstimulated cl⫺ transport (fig. 6b, left), producing a
significant approximately twofold reduction in campdependent cl⫺ transport (right, p ⬍ 0.001).

discussion

this study establishes a pleural surface fluorescence
method to measure unidirectional cl⫺ and na⫹ transport into the air space compartment in a perfused
mouse lung preparation. membrane-impermeant ionselective indicators were chosen with appropriate optical properties and sensitivities to measure cl⫺ and
na⫹ transport. the ion flux rates deduced by measurement of pleural surface fluorescence were validated by
analysis of air space fluid samples. the pleural surface
methodology was applied to characterize unidirectional cl⫺ and na⫹ transport across the distal air
space barrier in intact lung and to investigate two
questions: does ion transporter upregulation occurs in
transgenic mouse models of aquaporin deficiency, and
does distal lung cl⫺ transport require cftr? compared with cell culture models, measurements in intact
lung preparations are more closely related to in vivo
lung physiology because the complex tissue anatomy

fluorescence measurement of lung salt transport

the driving force. the strong amiloride inhibition of
active fluid absorption in mouse lung suggests that
enac is the principal na⫹ channel involved in this
process. in contrast, passive unidirectional na⫹ transport occurs through all pathways, including different
epithelial cell types and the paracellular pathway. the
lesser inhibition of amiloride on unidirectional na⫹
flux than active fluid absorption suggests that the
major pathways for unidirectional na⫹ flux are not
amiloride sensitive. although paracellular permeability is likely to be a major contributor to unidirectional
na⫹ flux in this model, the studies here do not quantify
relative contributions from type i alveolar epithelial
cells and various cells lining the airways.
the pleural surface fluorescence approach was applied to determine whether aquaporin deletion in mice
causes upregulation of na⫹ and cl⫺ transporters to
compensate for reduced osmotic water permeability.
salt transporter upregulation is a possible explanation
of our observations that  xxxg180xxx  and aqp5 deletion in
lung does not impair active fluid absorption from the
distal air spaces, even after maximizing the rate of
fluid absorption by camp agonists and type ii cell
upregulation by keratinocyte growth factor (24). we
reasoned that functional measurement of salt transport is superior to genomic or proteomic analysis because of the complex posttranslational processing and
trafficking of the major lung salt transporters such as
enac and cftr and because of the incomplete knowledge of the transporters responsible for alveolar fluid
clearance. the data here show that passive na⫹ and
cl⫺ transport were unaffected by deletion of  xxxg180xxx  or
aqp5, despite an ⬃10-fold reduction in osmotically
induced water permeability across the air space-capillary osmotic barrier. these results provide evidence
against functionally significant upregulation of salt
transport in distal lung in aquaporin knockout mice.
the data support the conjecture that high lung water
permeability and aquaporins are not needed for active
fluid absorption because the rate of fluid absorption in
lung is substantially lower than that in epithelia (25,
36, 37) where aquaporins were shown to be required.
mutations in cftr cl⫺ channels cause the most
common lethal genetic disease, cystic fibrosis. the
mechanisms by which nonfunctional cftr causes
lung disease are not clear (31). proposed consequences
of cftr mutation on airway physiology include abnormally low airway surface liquid (asl) salt concentration, low asl volume because of increased enac function, and low asl ph because of defective hco3⫺
transport (5, 38). our laboratory reported, using fluorescent indicators, that asl salt concentration, ph,
and osmolality are not different in cystic fibrosis (18,
19) but that submucosal gland viscosity is increased
(17). fang et al. (11) recently proposed a novel function
of cftr in distal air space function: impaired campdependent active fluid absorption. they found that
camp-stimulated alveolar fluid clearance and air
space fluid 36cl exit in wild-type mice were inhibited by
 xxxd2215xxx . camp-stimulated alveolar fluid clearance and air space fluid 36cl exit were also reduced in

and cellular heterogeneity are preserved. however, a
limitation of intact lung measurements is that it is
generally not possible to define the details of apical and
basolateral membrane cl⫺ and na⫹ transporting
mechanisms because of the complex mixture of cell
types participating in the response in intact lung and
because of uncertainties in driving forces. in addition,
because of the [cl⫺] and [na⫹] sensitivities of available
ion indicators and the fairly slow rates of lung ion
movement, the experiments required initial perfusion
with solutions containing zero [cl⫺] or [na⫹] and measurement of cl⫺ and na⫹ entry (rather than exit) into
the fluid-filled air space compartment.
cl⫺ entry into the air space compartment was measured from the time course of air space fluid lucigenin
fluorescence after an increase in perfusate [cl⫺]. the
rate of cl⫺ entry increased linearly with perfusate
[cl⫺]. elevation of cellular camp by  xxxd1742xxx  and
 xxxd2388xxx  increased the rate of cl⫺ influx by 2.1-fold.
these results are consistent with the study of nielsen
et al. (30), showing an approximately twofold forskolininduced stimulation of cl⫺ secretion into rabbit lungs
containing a zero cl⫺ solution. the camp-dependent
cl⫺ influx, but not the basal cl⫺ influx, was inhibited
by  xxxd2215xxx . neither basal nor camp-stimulated
cl⫺ influx was significantly inhibited by amiloride or
bumetanide, or na⫹ and k⫹ replacement by nmg⫹,
indicating that, under our experimental conditions,
cl⫺ influx were accompanied by no3⫺ efflux rather
than na⫹ or k⫹ influx. these results indicate that cl⫺
transport across the distal air space barrier is camp
regulated, which may be responsible, in part, for the
camp-dependent elevation in alveolar fluid clearance
measured in lungs of mice and other mammals.
na⫹ entry into the air space compartment was measured from the time course of air space fluid sodium
green fluorescence after a change in perfusate [na⫹].
however, a limitation in the na⫹ transport studies was
that na⫹ entry was accompanied in large part by cl⫺
entry to maintain electroneutrality, as evidenced by
partial inhibition of na⫹ entry by  xxxd2215xxx  and
cl⫺ substitution. the incomplete inhibition of na⫹
entry by cl⫺ substitution may be due to the nonzero
gluconate⫺ permeability, incomplete interstitial cl⫺
depletion, and/or movement of other ions (such as k⫹)
to maintain electroneutrality. the robust camp-stimulated na⫹ entry suggests direct activation of the na⫹
pathway by camp. the persistent camp stimulation of
na⫹ entry in the absence of cl⫺, albeit lesser in magnitude than in the presence of cl⫺, suggests that
camp-stimulated na⫹ entry is not produced exclusively by camp-stimulated cl⫺ influx and electrogenic
na⫹-cl⫺ coupling. an interesting observation was the
weak inhibition of na⫹ entry by amiloride (by ⬃30%),
compared with the strong inhibition (by up to 90%) of
isosmolar fluid absorption in mouse lung (11). active
fluid absorption is a transcellular process in which the
basolateral membrane na⫹-k⫹ pump generates the
electrochemical potential to drive na⫹ (and cl⫺) transport. thus active fluid transport involves transcellular
na⫹ transport through the same cell that generates

cystic fibrosis (⌬f508 cftr mutant) mice. the data
here support the conclusion that camp-stimulated, but
not basal cl⫺, transport across the distal air space
barrier is blocked by  xxxd2215xxx  but suggest that
the interpretation of cl⫺ transport in cystic fibrosis
mice is more complex. although there was a significant
approximately twofold reduction in camp-stimulated
cl⫺ influx in cftr null mice compared with wild-type
mice, in agreement with the involvement of cftr as
proposed by fang et al. (11), we found camp-stimulated cl⫺ transport in ⬃50% of the cftr null mice. in
addition to cftr, our data suggest the presence of
other camp-regulated cl⫺ transporting pathway(s) in
distal lung. the heterogeneity in cl⫺ transport from
mouse to mouse in cftr null mice may represent
effects of modifier genes and environmental or other
factors on the expression of alternative camp-regulated cl⫺ transporters. the challenge will be to identify the transporter(s) responsible for the camp-dependent cl⫺ transport process defined functionally in our
experiments.
in summary, the results here establish a pleural
surface fluorescence method to measure continuously
the transport of cl⫺ and na⫹ into the air space compartment in perfused mouse lungs. compared with
prior fluid sampling methods, our approach allows continuous noninvasive monitoring of distal air space fluid
ionic content during perfusate solution changes. this
methodology is technically simple and should be
readily applicable to study lung salt transport in other
transgenic mouse models and mammalian species and
to study salt secretion in the perinatal lung.
