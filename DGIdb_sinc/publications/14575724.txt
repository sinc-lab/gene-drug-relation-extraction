abstract
based on the body of evidence implicating ocular blood ﬂow disturbances in the pathogenesis of glaucoma, there is great interest
in the investigation of the effects of antiglaucoma drugs and systemic medications on the various ocular vascular beds. the primary
aim of this article was to review the current data available on the effects of antiglaucoma drugs and systemic medications on ocular
blood ﬂow. we performed a literature search in november 2002, which consisted of a textword search in medline for the years
1968–2002. the results of this review suggest that there is a severe lack of well-designed long-term studies investigating the effects of
antiglaucoma and systemic medications on ocular blood ﬂow in glaucomatous patients. however, among the 136 articles dealing
with the effect of antiglaucoma drugs on ocular blood ﬂow, only 36 (26.5%) investigated the effects of medications on glaucoma
patients. among these 36 articles, only 3 (8.3%) were long-term studies, and only 16 (44.4%) were double-masked, randomized,
prospective trials. among the 33 articles describing the effects of systemic medications on ocular blood ﬂow, only 11 (33.3%)
investigated glaucoma patients, of which only one (9.1%) was a double-masked, randomized, prospective trial. based on this
preliminary data, we would intimate that few antiglaucoma medications have the potential to directly improve ocular blood ﬂow.
unoprostone appears to have a reproducible antiendothelin-1 effect, betaxolol may exert a calcium-channel blocker action,
 xxxd201xxx  consistently leads to anterior segment vasoconstriction, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors seem to accelerate the
retinal circulation. longitudinal, prospective, randomized trials are needed to investigate the effects of vasoactive substances with no
hypotensive effect on the progression of glaucoma.

1. rationale for modulating ocular blood ﬂow in the
treatment of glaucoma
glaucoma refers to a multifactorial disease characterized by a progressive optic neuropathy followed by
gradual visual ﬁeld loss. elevated intraocular pressure
(iop), which previously was part of the deﬁnition of
glaucoma, is now recognized as the major risk factor for
the development of the disease. years ago, adrenergic
drugs, parasympathomimetics, beta-blockers and sys-

temic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (cais) were the
only available drugs to treat glaucoma. despite the
change in concept and the development of new
antiglaucoma medications, reducing the iop remains
the mainstream of glaucoma therapy.
there is sufﬁcient evidence to suggest that high iops
are not responsible for the development of all glaucoma
cases and that reducing iop is not effective in avoiding
the progression of each and every glaucoma patient.
epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that the

article in press

conversion rate of ocular hypertensive patients to
glaucoma is low (leibowitz et al., 1980; bengtsson,
1981; hollows and graham, 1996), indicating that not
all patients with high iops develop glaucomatous optic
neuropathy. furthermore, other studies report that as
many as half of patients with glaucoma have normal
iops when the diagnosis is ﬁrst made (bengtsson, 1981;
leibowitz et al., 1980; sommer et al., 1991).
in a retrospective study, hattenhauer et al. (1998)
evaluated 295 newly diagnosed patients with open-angle
glaucoma between 1965 and 1980, with a mean followup of 15 years. patients with primary open-angle
glaucoma (poag) had a 9% chance of becoming blind
in both eyes and a 26% chance of becoming blind in at
least one eye at 20 years despite treatment. one might
argue that the number of medications available at that
time was limited, or that the study did not report the
severity of glaucoma damage, or even that the iop
control of those patients was not evaluated, nevertheless, the estimated risk of blindness at 20 years
among treated patients is both signiﬁcant and disturbing
to those who treat glaucoma.
collaborative normal-tension glaucoma study
group (1998) designed a prospective, randomized,
multicenter study to evaluate the effect of a 30%
reduction in iop. although the group achieving this
goal had a lower progression rate than the control
group, 20% of patients achieving the desired iop
reduction were estimated to progress after 5 years,
whereas 40% of the patients with no treatment were
estimated to remain stable.
the advanced glaucoma interventional study
(agis) investigators (2000) was another multicenter,
randomized study designed to compare two treatment
sequences in patients with advanced glaucoma. in the
so-called associative analysis, the authors divided the
patients in groups according to the iops measured
throughout 8 years of follow-up. group a comprised
patients with 100% of iop measurements below
18 mmhg, whereas group b included patients with
75–99% of the iops below 18 mmhg, group c had
patients with 50–74% of the measurements below
18 mmhg and group d included patients with less than
50% of iop measurements below 18 mmhg. although
the risk for visual ﬁeld deterioration was signiﬁcantly
lower for group a, compared to the other groups,
14.4% of the patients in this group were estimated to
progress after 7 years. this data is comparable with
previous studies that demonstrate that the visual ﬁeld
loss of some patients with a history of increased iop
continues to progress despite iop reduction, even after
ﬁltering surgery (werner et al., 1977; jerndal and
lundstrom, 1980; kidd and o’connor, 1985; stewart
et al., 2000).
a report from the ocular hypertension treatment
study (kass et al., 2002) revealed that 4.4% of the

771

treated eyes and 9.5% of the untreated eyes developed
glaucoma after 5 years of follow-up. in this multicenter
study, the goal of treatment was to reduce the iop by
20% and to reach an iop of 24 mmhg or less. recently,
the results of the early manifest glaucoma trial
became available (heijl et al., 2002). this study, which
randomized patients with early glaucomatous damage to
treatment vs. no treatment, indicated that 45% of the
treated patients (mean iop decrease=25%) and 62% of
the untreated group showed progression after a median
follow-up period of 6 years. the authors later published
that standard treatment reduced the risk of progression
by 50% (leske et al., 2003).
all the above-mentioned studies parallel the clinical
impression that iop reduction is beneﬁcial for patients
with normal tension glaucoma ( xxxd2741xxx ), poag and
ocular hypertension, but it is not 100% effective in
preventing the progression of glaucomatous optic nerve
damage. glaucoma is a multifactorial condition, with
iop being one of the identiﬁable risk factors, and it is
essential to recognize the other factors that participate
in the pathogenesis of the disease. in a previous article,
we discussed the rationale for including ocular blood
ﬂow (obf) disturbances as one of the possible factors
involved in the pathogenesis of glaucoma (flammer
et al., 2002).
in summary, a number of systemic vascular disorders
have been associated with glaucoma; including diabetes,
hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and migraine
(becker, 1971; corbett et al., 1986; phelps and corbett,
1985; drance et al., 1988; mcleod et al., 1990; flammer
et al., 2001). different techniques were employed to
demonstrate, on average, a reduced ocular perfusion in
glaucoma patients at the optic nerve head (onh)
(hamard et al., 1994; findl et al., 2000; piltz-seymour
et al., 2001; ciancaglini et al., 2001; harju and vesti,
2001), choroid (duijm et al., 1997; greve et al., 1999),
retina (michelson et al., 1996, 1998; chung et al.,
1999a, b; harju and vesti, 2001), and retrobulbar vessels
(galassi et al., 1992; costa et al., 1994; trible et al.,
1994; rankin et al., 1995; nicolela et al., 1996a, b).
whether these blood ﬂow abnormalities are secondary
to iop changes or whether they cause intrinsic damage
is debatable. however, experimental studies have
demonstrated that glaucomatous damage can be reproduced in animals by injecting a vasoactive substance
( xxxg674xxx ), with no change in iop (ciofﬁ and
sullivan, 1999; oku et al., 1999). a number of
mechanisms have been suggested to explain why obf
reduction may lead to glaucoma (flammer et al., 2002),
including increased resistivity to ﬂow, reduced perfusion
pressure, and impaired autoregulation. increased resistivity could be caused by anatomical variations,
vasculitis, arteriosclerosis, or vasospasm. several studies
have indicated the association between peripheral or
ocular vasospasm and glaucoma (rojanapongpun and

v.p. costa et al. / progress in retinal and eye research 22 (2003) 769–805

drance, 1993; harris et al., 1994; flammer, 1997;
broadway and drance, 1998; o’brien, 1998; flammer
et al., 1999). reduced perfusion pressure might be
secondary to an increased iop or decreased blood
pressure, with both being ﬁrmly associated with
glaucoma (drance et al., 1973; kaiser and flammer,
1991; kaiser et al., 1993; hayreh et al., 1994; graham
et al., 1995; bonomi et al., 2000; kashiwagi et al., 2001).
finally, autoregulation deﬁcits, characterized by the
inability to compensate for changes in iop or blood
pressure in order to maintain adequate perfusion (harris
et al., 1998a), have also been described in the retinal
(geijer and bill, 1979; grunwald et al., 1984; sponsel
et al., 1997) and onh circulations (geijer and bill,
1979; evans et al., 1999b) in both experimental studies
and glaucoma patients (pillunat et al., 1997).
based on the body of evidence suggesting the
participation of obf disturbances in the pathogenesis
of glaucoma, great interest has ensued in the investigation of the effects of antiglaucoma drugs and systemic
medications on the various ocular vascular beds (harris
et al., 2001b; harris and jonescu-cuypers, 2001). with
the possibility that reduced obf or a dysfunctional
autoregulation may play an important role in the
pathogenesis of glaucoma, creating either acute or
chronic vasoconstriction in diseased eyes may be
harmful, partially counteracting the expected increase
in perfusion pressure secondary to an iop reduction.
the purposes of this review article are:
(a) to summarize the rationale behind the pharmacological modulation of obf in the treatment of
glaucoma.
(b) to brieﬂy review the various techniques available to
evaluate obf.
(c) to review studies investigating the availability of
antiglaucoma drugs in the vascular beds relevant to
the pathogenesis of glaucoma.
(d) to review the current data regarding the effects
of antiglaucoma drugs and systemic medications
on obf.

the retinal circulation accounts for approximately
15% of total obf. uveal blood ﬂow comprises the
remaining 85%, including ﬂow to the choroid, ciliary
body, and iris (alm, 1992). the techniques discussed
below, when used in concert, provide a comprehensive
examination of ocular hemodynamics. however, each
method of assessing some portion of ocular hemodynamics is likely to have its own inherent limitations. a
detailed description of the techniques that measure obf
can be found elsewhere (harris et al., 1999a; flammer
et al., 2002). in order to facilitate the understanding of
the articles that will be discussed, a brief review of these
methods is presented below.
2.1. color doppler imaging (cdi)
cdi is an ultrasound technique that combines b-scan
grayscale imaging of tissue structure, and color representation of blood velocity computed from dopplershifted reﬂections (taylor and holland, 1990). in
ophthalmology, cdi is used to measure blood ﬂow
velocities in veins and arteries, which supply and drain
the eye. current cdi analysis focuses primarily on
velocities in arteries: speciﬁcally, the ophthalmic artery
(oa), central retinal artery (cra), and short posterior
ciliary arteries (spcas) immediately behind the globe
(trible et al., 1994; williamson et al., 1995). blood ﬂow
velocities in these arteries are measured and displayed in
real time.
the cdi image consists of a grayscale image of the
globe with color-coded velocity data overlaid (fig. 1).
the direction of blood ﬂow is used to color code
doppler shifts. blood ﬂow away from the center of the
body and toward the instrument’s probe is generally

2. ocular blood ﬂow measurement techniques
in the last 30 years, the assessment of ocular
circulation has evolved from a subjective description
of visible vessels to direct quantitative measurement of
ocular blood velocity and ﬂow. since no single technique
provides a complete description of ocular hemodynamics, it is impossible to obtain a measurement from a
single device and extrapolate a complete and accurate
understanding of obf. therefore, a number of measurements are used to quantify the various vascular beds
comprising the ocular circulation.

fig. 1. the cdi image consists of a grayscale image of the globe with
color-coded velocity data overlaid. flow toward the cdi probe
(arterial) is displayed in red; ﬂow away from the probe (venous) is
displayed in blue.

arterial and displayed in red; blood ﬂow toward the
center of the body and away from the probe is venous
and displayed in blue. it is important that the examiner
has knowledge of both retrobulbar vascular anatomy
and the characteristic waveforms of the relevant arteries
and veins.
two blood velocity values are measured during
spectral analysis: the peak systolic velocity (psv) and
the end diastolic velocity (edv). a horizontal line on
the screen is placed on the psv, and a second line on the
edv. with this information, the cdi unit displays the
velocity values and calculates pourcelot’s (1975) resistive
index (ri) as
ri ¼

psv  edv
:
psv

ri is a dimensionless parameter ranging in value
between 0 and 1. the value 0 represents completely
non-pulsatile ﬂow with edv equal to psv, and 1
represents purely pulsatile ﬂow, with velocity equal to
zero during diastole.
reproducibility of cdi measurements has been
studied using a test/retest analysis (williamson et al.,
1995). the coefﬁcient of variation for each of the
measurement parameters psv, edv and ri in the oa,
cra, tspca, and nspca are displayed in tables 1
and 2. accurate, consistent positioning of the probe is
essential for good reproducibility.

2.2. scanning laser ophthalmoscopy
since flower and hochheimer ﬁrst successfully
performed indocyanine green (icg) angiography in
humans in the early 1970s (hochheimer, 1971; flower
and hochheimer, 1972), clinicians and researchers have
attempted to acquire high-resolution images of the
choroid. the recent introduction of the scanning laser
ophthalmoscope (slo) has elevated quantitative angiography to new heights.
the slo is a confocal laser device that overcomes
many of the limitations of traditional photographic or
video angiography. reﬂected light exits the eye through
the pupil and must pass through a confocal aperture
before reaching a solid-state detector. scattered light
and reﬂected light from sources outside the focal plane
are blocked by the confocal aperture. overall retinal
illumination is reduced and contrast is improved, as only
a single spot is illuminated by the laser beam, at any
moment. the resulting images are similar to those
obtained with standard video angiography, but with
improved spatial resolution and contrast.
a new method to analyze icg slo angiography is
based on dye-dilution curve analysis, which has been
studied since the 1920s. the dye duration area (the time
between ﬁrst arterial appearance and the extrapolated
zero concentration time) is analyzed (fig. 2) and the
average measured dye concentration is calculated. in
ophthalmology, dilution curve techniques have been
used to quantify retinal hemodynamics, including the
arterial-venous passage time (avp time). using computer video analysis techniques, the concentration of a
dye, ﬂuorescein, is quantiﬁed by measuring the brightness of ﬂuorescence from within the blood. dilution
curves are used to provide the time delay between dye
arrival to two points. measuring the distance between
those points, and knowing the time for blood passage
between them allows calculation of dye velocity (wolf
et al., 1990) (fig. 3).

analysis (ada). the entire 40 icg angiogram is
divided into a number of small regions, and dilution
curves are created for each region. six locations, each a
6 square, are identiﬁed for analysis (fig. 4). the
average brightness of the area contained in each box is
computed for each frame of the angiogram. area
brightness is graphed with time on the x-axis and
brightness on the y-axis. ada identiﬁes three parameters from the brightness maps: slope (which represents the speed of blood as it enters the choroid), 10%
arrival time, and dye duration.
2.3. heidelberg retina flowmetry
the heidelberg retina ﬂowmeter (hrf, heidelberg
engineering, germany) is a non-invasive confocal
scanning laser imaging device that maps blood ﬂow

magnitudes in retinal capillaries (zinser, 1999). quantiﬁcation of retinal blood ﬂow is accomplished through a
series of point measurements, each with a resolution of
approximately 10  10 mm on the retinal plane, and ﬁeld
depth of 400 mm. various studies have been published
measuring the effects of disease and medications on
blood ﬂow in the fundus (kagemann et al., 1998).
however, many questions on the validity of hrf still
remain. one concern is the arbitrary unit in the hrf
report. despite previous experiments (chauhan and
smith, 1997), physical units have not been successfully
correlated to the arbitrary units. furthermore, the
functional range for these units as well as the normal
values are yet to be determined (see figs. 5 and 6).
the hrf noise estimation and correction algorithm,
as conveyed in correspondences with heidelberg engineering, is based on the assumption that brighter
images have proportionally more noise than darker
images. this algorithm has not been published nor peer
veriﬁed for ﬂow measurement applications. it would
produce higher ﬂow readings for darker areas, since
only a small correction would be subtracted from the
raw scan spectrum (tsang et al., 1999). since these
corrections are derived globally and subtracted locally,
the reported values are distorted between regions of the
same image and among different images. when performing repeated examinations of a single normal eye, it
is imperative to align the image perfectly and to set the
illumination to the same level by control of the
sensitivity setting and camera-to-eye distance from one
examination to the next. different individuals would be
expected to have different levels of fundus pigmentation
and geometry. it is unlikely that a simple intensity
adjustment can compensate for the complex consequences of these noise corrections. finally, the progressive disc pallor characteristic of glaucoma will result in
progressively darker images in longitudinal measurements, even under strict control. a ﬂow change reported
in these circumstances is likely to be confounded by the
optical properties of the fundus (kagemann et al., 2001).
2.4. laser doppler velocimetry
bi-directional laser doppler velocimetry (ldv) measures the maximum blood cell velocity in large retinal
vessels (feke et al., 1989; milbocker et al., 1991).
velocity is calculated from an analysis of doppler shifts
observed in light scattered by moving blood cells. the
instrument consists of a modiﬁed fundus camera with
the 35 mm camera body replaced with a unit containing
ﬁber optics. a low-powered laser light source illuminates the large vessels. the operator can position the
beam so that it lies over a retinal vessel. by placing the
optical ﬁbers on the reﬂected laser spot, the returning
laser light is sampled by photomultiplier tubes, and
converted to an electrical signal. the signal contains

information about the frequency spectra of the laser
light that can be recorded and analyzed. the shift in
frequency is proportional to the velocity of the moving
blood cells. at some point, a maximum velocity is
attained by some cells in the blood stream that is
reﬂected by a ﬁnal peak in the spectra. from this ﬁnal
frequency, originally identiﬁed by the operator (feke
et al., 1989) but more recently by an automated
computer algorithm, the maximum velocity, or vmax ;
can be calculated. this, in turn, has been used to
calculate the average blood cell velocity, vmean ; using the
formula vmean ¼ vmax =1:6 (value established experimentally) (damon and duling, 1979).
2.5. oculo-oscillo-dynamography

fig. 5. bovine blood ﬂowed through a heparinized capillary tube, and
down a glass slide (to control surface tension). images of the ﬂow were
taken by hrf without optical magniﬁcation.

in 1985, ulrich and ulrich (1985) introduced oculooscillo-dynamography (oodg), a method that assesses
blood pressure in central retinal and ciliary arteries.
oodg combines scleral suction with the recording of
the ocular pulse. ocular pulsatility refers to changes in
iop over time due to the change in the eye’s volume
during the cardiac cycle. each of the vessels supplying
the eye contributes to the ocular pulse wave.
the oodg instrument consists of a scleral suction
cup connected to a suction pump and to a pressure
transducer. ocular pulsation produces pressure changes
that are converted by the transducer into an electronic
signal and sent to a microcomputer. oscillating pulse
waves are digitized and recorded by the computer. as

the suction cup is placed on the sclera, the iop increases
and the ocular pulse wave becomes shallower and is
ﬁnally extinguished when iop surpasses systolic blood
pressure (ulrich et al., 1989).
once the ocular pulse is extinguished, the suction is
slowly released. as the iop falls, ocular pulse waves
reappears. the cra pulse reappears ﬁrst, followed by
the ciliary artery pulse. finally, the iop falls below the
diastolic pressure in the vessels. the source of the pulses
has been conﬁrmed by ulrich & ulrich by performing
ﬂuorescein angiography simultaneously with oodg
(ulrich et al., 1989).

simple panel, which can adjust the velocity and density
of the leukocytes.
although the blue ﬁeld entoptic simulation is a
subjective test, repeated measures in the same subjects
have been shown to be reproducible (yap and brown,
1994). an investigator must rely on the subject’s ability
to perform a psychophysical matching task that may
depend on the subject’s cognitive skills. the relationship
between the recreated leukocyte velocity and density and
the actual speed and prevalence of leukocytes in the
perimacular capillaries is unknown. this and the lack of
an actual blood ﬂow measurement from the technique
make its quantitative results difﬁcult to interpret.

2.6. blue field entoptic simulation
2.7. laser speckle flowmetry
the blue ﬁeld entoptic phenomenon refers to the
effect created by gazing into bright blue illumination.
this allows a person to see the movement of leukocytes
through their perimacular capillaries. the source of the
phenomenon, leukocytes shadows on the retina, has
been conﬁrmed experimentally (sinclair et al., 1989). in
an early attempt to take advantage of this effect to
assess perimacular hemodynamics, subjects were asked
to count the number of particles passing a given spot in
30 s while staring at a blue ﬁeld of light (riehm et al.,
1972).
in 1980, riva and petrig (1980) introduced their blue
field entoptic simulator. the instrument allows subjects to view their entoptic image and then attempt to
match the velocity and density of simulated leukocytes
on a computer screen to that of their own. the
simulation is displayed on a color monitor. when the
blue light source is on, the simulation is masked behind
a tilted glass pane. the simulation is controlled by a

illumination of the fundus with a coherent light
source produces a number of interference phenomena.
the speckle phenomenon is observed as a speckled
pattern of light, which is scattered from the fundus when
illuminated by a coherent source. the pattern varies
rapidly with the cardiac cycle and the rate of pattern
variation depends on the magnitude of retinal blood
ﬂow. the laser speckle ﬂowmeter quantiﬁes the rate of
variation in the speckle pattern as a surrogate for
volumetric retinal blood ﬂow. variations in the speckle
pattern are quantiﬁed point by point throughout the
fundus, and a ﬂow map is created. earlier photographic
methods using the speckle phenomenon were able to
display the distribution of velocity in the retina.
however, despite the advantage of producing a distributive description of retinal blood velocities, it only
allowed a semi-quantitative estimation of retinal microcirculation and could not follow time course changes.

tamaki et al. (1993) described an improved apparatus
for non-contact two-dimensional measurement of the
microcirculation in the onh. their apparatus consists
of a fundus camera equipped with an 808 nm diode
laser. normalized blur is calculated for each pixel within
a 0.62  0.62 mm area of the retina. normalized blur is
equal to the average reﬂected intensity divided by the
absolute difference between average intensity and a 98
point ﬂoating average. the laser speckle technique is a
non-invasive technique capable of measuring blood
velocity with good reproducibility, albeit in arbitrary
units. the two greatest disadvantages of the technique
are that it is not commercially available, and that the
meaning of the raw normalized blur measurement is not
clearly understood.
2.8. pulsatile ocular blood flow (pobf)
pobf, described by langham et al. (1989a, b) and
determined tonographically from the iop pulse, has
been widely employed because it is rapid, easy to use,
and relatively inexpensive. pobf reﬂects the pulsatile,
and not the steady component of arterial inﬂow to the
eye, and is inﬂuenced by refractive error and axial
length. although the exact proportion of the total blood
ﬂow that is pulsatile is presently unknown, estimates
indicate it to be between 50% and 80% (langham et al.,
1989a; krakau, 1995).
the obf instrument samples iop at 200 hz over a
time interval of 5–20 s using a disposable probe. a builtin processor analyzes different characteristics of the iop
pulse waves and selects the ﬁve most representative
pulses for the calculation of pobf. despite wide interindividual variation, the technique is characterized by
excellent reproducibility (butt and o’brien, 1995;
schmetterer et al., 1998).
nonetheless, the physiological interpretation of
pobf recordings remains uncertain. because most of
the blood ﬂow into the eye is within the choroidal
circulation, it is presumed that pobf primarily measures the pulsatile component of choroidal perfusion,
independent from the retinal circulation (langham et al.,
1989a, b).
2.9. hydrogen clearance
the measurement of blood ﬂow by hydrogen clearance is an extension of the fick principle (auckland,
1964; fieschi et al., 1965). in fick’s method, oxygen
consumption and oxygen concentration on the arterial
and venous sides are measured. the total blood ﬂow is
calculated as the ratio between oxygen consumption and
the difference between arterial and venous oxygen
concentration. measurement of retinal or onh blood
ﬂow with diffusible tracers requires a knowledge of the
volume of the tracer introduced into the body, and real

777

time measurement of the concentration of the tracer in
the tissue of interest. in the case of hydrogen clearance,
a hydrogen microprobe surgically placed adjacent to the
fundus or onh, and the concentration is measured in
real time. hydrogen is used because it is readily diffused
into the tissue from retinal capillaries.
2.10. intraluminal corrosion casting (icc)
icc is an in vitro technique used to study the
microvascular anatomy of the retina and onh. after
clearing the blood vessels of intravascular clots by
ﬂushing with a tissue plasminogen activator, methyl
methacrylate is injected into the cra and/or the pcas.
the plastic is allowed to polymerize, and then the tissue
is removed by dissolution in a high concentration caustic
solution; 6 m potassium hydroxide. the casts of the
vasculature are mounted, coated with gold palladium,
and examined by scanning electron microscopy (oliver
et al., 1994, 1995).
2.11. fluorescent microsphere imaging
fluorescent microsphere imaging uses polystyrene
latex microspheres that incorporate one or more dyes.
these microspheres are injected intravenously into an
animal and are excited in the eye through the resident
lasers of a slo. the excited particles are detected by the
ophthalmoscope, and its output is then digitized directly
or recorded on a videocassette recorder, for subsequent
image analysis. multiple-dye microspheres use the
principle of resonance energy transfer for the activation
of the ﬁnal dye in a non-radiative cascade. these
microspheres enable the investigator to tailor the
excitation and emission spectra of the particles for the
investigation of different ocular tissues (alm and bill,
1973; khoobehi et al., 1997).

3. ocular penetration of topically applied antiglaucoma
medications
most glaucoma drugs are applied topically to the eye.
a small fraction of the drug dosage is absorbed directly
through the cornea, conjunctiva, and sclera, and a larger
fraction is absorbed into the systemic circulation.
penetration across the cornea is proposed as the primary
pathway by which drugs reach the anterior segment
after topical administration, whereas the conjunctiva/
scleral route is more important to allow the access to
posterior tissues (burstein and anderson, 1985; grass
and robinson, 1988; maurice, 2002). with regard to
iop lowering, the drug levels in the anterior segment of
the eye, in particular the ciliary body and iris, have been
extensively studied (araie et al., 1982; yamamura et al.,

article in press
778

v.p. costa et al. / progress in retinal and eye research 22 (2003) 769–805

1999; shih and lee, 1990; ashton et al., 1991; babiole
et al., 2001).
before assuming that one drug is capable of modifying blood ﬂow in one of the above-mentioned vascular
beds, one has to evaluate if the drug is capable of
reaching this vascular bed in an effective concentration.
in vitro studies analyzing the effect of one medication
on blood ﬂow may utilize concentrations that are not
obtained following a single or chronic instillation.
evaluation of the in vivo action of pharmacological
agents is incomplete without knowledge of their
disposition and metabolism in target tissues. unfortunately, studies investigating the concentration of antiglaucoma medications at the onh, retina, and choroid
are rare.
recently, a review article investigating drug delivery
to the posterior segment from drops was published
(maurice, 2002). however, although consideration was
given to the possible mechanisms associated with drug
penetration into the globe and the artifacts that may
inﬂuence the measurement of a drug level in a tissue
sample, the author did not include information regarding the speciﬁc concentrations of antiglaucoma drugs in
the vitreous, retina or choroid following the instillation
of drops. this information is displayed in the following
paragraphs.
3.1. pilocarpine
salminen et al. (1984) examined the absorption of 2%
pilocarpine eye drops in the rabbit eye. they reported
mean levels of pilocarpine of 3–6 mg/g in the iris and
ciliary body in albino rabbits and 10–15 mg/g in
pigmented rabbits, 30 min after application. in the
vitreous, the levels were 0.07–0.08 mg/g, and in the
choroid/retina the levels were 0.7 mg/g in the albino
rabbits and 2.1 mg/g in the pigmented rabbits.
3.2. beta-blockers
urtti et al. (1988, 1990) studied the penetration of
 xxxd3377xxx  into the rabbit eye. after topical application of 1
drop of  xxxd3377xxx  (125 mg), they found average levels of
14 mg/g in the iris and ciliary body and 0.03 mg/g in the
vitreous. similar levels were reported by salminen and
urtti (1984), who found a signiﬁcant increase in tissue
levels following multiple topical doses of  xxxd3377xxx  in the
rabbit eye.
araie et al. (1982) studied the absorption of  xxxd3377xxx  in
the rabbit eye and reported mean levels of 9 mg/g in the
iris and ciliary body, 0.02 mg/g in the vitreous, 1.6 mg/g in
the retina and vitreous, and 0.08 mg/g in the optic nerve
2 h after topical application.
 xxxd2467xxx , its metabolite, dihydrobunolol, and
 xxxd3377xxx  concentrations were measured in various ocular
tissues and compartments at eight time points after

topical administration of  xxxd2467xxx  0.5% or  xxxd3377xxx 
0.5% to albino rabbits (acheampong et al., 1995). two
hours after topical application, the mean levels of
 xxxd2467xxx  were 0.5 mg/g in the iris and ciliary body,
0.004 mg/g in the vitreous, 0.06 mg/g in the retina and
choroid, and 0.016 mg/g in the optic nerve.  xxxd3377xxx 
concentrations were higher than the corresponding
 xxxd2467xxx  and dihydrobunolol in the choroid-retina
and optic nerve. in fact, there was a 30-fold difference
between the maximum concentrations of  xxxd3377xxx 
(16.9 nmol/ml)
and
 xxxd2467xxx +dihydrobunolol
(0.58 nmol/ml) in the optic nerve. similar results were
obtained with radiolabeled compounds in rabbit eyes
(chen et al., 1987, 1988).
3.3. alpha-agonists
urtti et al. (1984) studied the penetration of topically
applied adrenaline (30 ml of 1% solution) in the albino
rabbit eye. three hours after instillation, adrenaline
levels were on average 0.24 mg/g in the iris and ciliary
body, 0.011 mg/g in the vitreous, and 0.45 mg/g in the
retina/choroid.
recently, acheampong et al. (2002) evaluated the
distribution of [14c] brimonidine into anterior and
posterior ocular tissues of monkey and rabbit eyes. the
authors demonstrated that the concentrations of radioactivity in the different ocular tissues increased after
multiple dosing, especially in pigmented tissues (iris,
ciliary body, and choroid/retina). since measurements
of tissue levels of drugs that bind to melanin can
overestimate the amount of drug available for receptor
activation, the authors emphasized the concentrations
found in the vitreous. after 2 weeks of treatment with
brimonidine 0.2% in monkeys, mean vitreous concentration was 82745 nm, higher than the 2 nm required
to activate 50% of alpha-2 receptors in isolated assay
systems (ec50).
in humans, kent et al. (2001) measured brimonidine
levels in vitreous samples from patients who had
received 0.2% brimonidine tartate 2 or 3 times a day
for 4–14 days. in phakic eyes, the average brimonidine
level in the vitreous was 9 nm, which corresponds to
0.003 mg/g.
3.4. prostaglandin analogues
.
sjoquist
et al. (1999) studied the pharmacokinetics of
 xxxd2446xxx  0.005% in cynomolgus monkeys. thirty
minute following topical application,  xxxd2446xxx  levels
were on average 0.28 mg/g in the iris and 0.08 mg/g in the
.
retina. sjoquist
et al. (1998) found higher levels in the
rabbit eye, where the maximal concentration of  xxxd2446xxx  following topical application was 0.3–0.4 mg/g in
the iris and ciliary body, although the levels in the
vitreous and choroid were very low.

3.5. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
sugrue (1996, 2000) investigated  xxxd1931xxx  levels in
the retina and other tissues of the rabbit eye, and
reported peak levels of 24.0 mg/g in the rabbit cornea,
7.8 mg/g in the aqueous humour and 27.0 mg/g in the irisciliary body, whereas stefa! nsson et al. (unpublished
data) found 16.5, 2.2, and 30.9 mg/g, respectively.
schmitz et al. (1999) measured the concentration of
 xxxd1931xxx  in the human aqueous humor following
topical application, and their results were similar to
those obtained in the rabbit. in the retina, sugrue
reported 4.26 mg/g at 1 h after application, 4.16 mg/g at
2 h, 5.29 mg/g at 4 h, and 2.09 at 8 h, whereas stefa! nsson
et al. (unpublished data) found lower levels (0.16, 0.52,
0.77, and 0.88 mg/g, respectively). in contrast, conroy
(1997) tested the ocular absorption of two topically
applied sulfonamides (not  xxxd1931xxx ) in the rabbit
eye, and found that these did not reach the retina,
suggesting that different sulfonamides may have different ocular pharmacokinetics.
the levels of  xxxd1931xxx  found in the retina and
optic nerve are in the range of 1.0 mg/g and always above
0.1 mg/g 2–8 h after application (stefa! nsson et al.,
unpublished data). the 50% inhibition levels of
carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme ii and iv (ic 50) for
 xxxd1931xxx  are 0.18 nm or 65 mg/g and 6.9 nm or
2.5 mg/g, respectively. hence, the reported levels after
topical application of  xxxd1931xxx  are higher than the
ic 50 for both isoenzymes. it is reasonable to assume
that  xxxd1931xxx  at these levels inhibits most of the
 xxxg293xxx  and iv in the retina and optic
nerve.
similar to  xxxd1931xxx ,  xxxd367xxx  was found to
penetrate the eye and reach the retina in effective
concentrations. desantis (2000) measured  xxxd367xxx 
levels in the retina in pigmented rabbits and found a
mean concentration of 0.338 mg/g.

the effect of medications on peripheral blood ﬂow,
visual ﬁeld or other psychophysical tests were not
included. we found no study evaluating the inﬂuence
of  xxxd3414xxx  or  xxxd340xxx  on obf.
the information gathered, following the literature
search is shown according to the drug. for each drug,
we discussed the pharmacology (with emphasis on the
theoretical inﬂuence on blood ﬂow), and reviewed
studies investigating the effects on obf according to
the different techniques.
although the literature dealing with the topic
discussed in this review is vast, it is comprised of several
unmasked, short-term, non-controlled studies, where
the possible inﬂuence of iop reduction on the observed
blood ﬂow changes was not taken into account.
furthermore, most of the studies dealing with systemic
drugs do not compensate for the possible inﬂuence of
concomitant antiglaucoma medication.
prudence is required when speculating on obf in
glaucoma patients on the basis of results from animal
studies. results from in vitro or animal studies provide
valuable information, but their ﬁndings cannot be
automatically extrapolated to humans. regarding human studies, there are some indications that patients
with glaucoma may behave differently when
exposed to vasoactive drugs when compared to healthy
individuals and ocular hypertensives, limiting the
importance of studies including such populations. the
ﬁndings of experimental studies, as well as studies
investigating healthy individuals and ocular hypertensives are listed, but the reader is warned to interpret
them with caution.
for these reasons, a greater emphasis is given to in
vivo studies evaluating the effect of drugs on glaucoma
patients, which unfortunately represent a minority.
these studies were analyzed in detail, including a
description of their design, sample size, duration,
and undesirable inﬂuence of other variables.

5. the effects of antiglaucoma drugs on ocular blood ﬂow
we performed a literature search in november 2002
which consisted of a textword search in medline for
the years 1968–2002. it used the combination of the
terms blood ﬂow and pilocarpine,  xxxd3377xxx , betaxolol,
 xxxd2467xxx , carteolol,  xxxd201xxx , brimonidine,  xxxd1931xxx ,  xxxd367xxx , acetazolamide,  xxxd2446xxx ,
 xxxd3414xxx ,  xxxd340xxx , and unoprostone. articles
dealing with obf were then selected and reviewed. this
search retrieved 136 citations. articles investigating the
effects of systemic medications on obf were also
reviewed through the combination of the terms blood
ﬂow and calcium channel blocker, magnesium, ginkgo
biloba,  xxxd1914xxx , and renin-angiotensin inhibitor.

5.1. pilocarpine
pilocarpine is a parasympathomimetic drug that
promotes its effect directly at the neuromuscular
junction. cholinergic stimulation of the ciliary muscle
by pilocarpine results in traction of the scleral spur,
altering the conﬁguration of the trabecular meshwork
and leading to enhanced outﬂow and reduced iop
(drance and nash, 1971; fellman and starita, 1990). in
general, parasympathomimetic drugs tend to induce
vasodilation, although stjernschantz (1990) suggested
a colinergic-induced vasoconstriction in the anterior
uvea.

5.1.1. experimental studies
the effect of pilocarpine on the isolated rabbit ciliary
artery was investigated using isometric tension recording
methods, by yoshitomi et al. (2000), who were able to
show a dose-dependent muscle relaxation that was
inﬂuenced by the endothelium and  xxxd2738xxx  synthesis.
green and hatchett (1987) measured the blood ﬂow in
rabbit eyes following the instillation of pilocarpine 4%
t.i.d. for 5 weeks employing the radioactive microsphere
technique.  xxxd2950xxx treated eyes showed a trend
toward reduction in anterior segment (iris and ciliary
body) blood ﬂow, but no signiﬁcant change was
observed in either retinal or choroidal blood ﬂow. on
the other hand, alm et al. (1973) found a signiﬁcant
vasodilation in the anterior segment of primates 45–
60 min after a single drop of pilocarpine 4%. other
experimental studies employing the labeled microsphere
technique demonstrated that pilocarpine did not change
retinal and choroidal blood ﬂow in normal rabbits
(chiou and yan, 1986), but improved ﬂow in both
vascular beds in ocular hypertensive rabbits (chiou and
chen, 1992), and cats (kaskel et al., 1978). mittag et al.
(1994) measured the pobf of glaucomatous monkeys
following the instillation of pilocarpine 4% and
observed a signiﬁcant increase that was positively
correlated with the iop lowering effect of the drug.
5.1.2. studies in healthy individuals and ocular
hypertensive patients
in a study evaluating the effects of pilocarpine 2% on
10 healthy subjects, retinal and ciliary perfusion
pressures were measured using the oodg, but no
signiﬁcant change was detected (pillunat and stodrmeister, 1988). in a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
randomized, crossover study involving 10 healthy
subjects, pulsatile choroidal and optic disc blood ﬂow,
and blood ﬂow velocities in the cra and oa (measured
by cdi) were not found to change following the
instillation of pilocarpine 2% (schmetterer et al.,
1997). conﬂicting results have been published regarding
the effect of pilocarpine on pobf of ocular hypertensive
patients. while shaikh and mars (2001) described a
signiﬁcant increase in pobf following the instillation of
pilocarpine 2% (n ¼ 16), mittag et al. (1994) observed
no signiﬁcant change in the ocular pulse amplitude after
pilocarpine 4% (n ¼ 6).
5.1.3. studies in glaucoma patients
the only study evaluating the effect of pilocarpine on
glaucoma patients was performed by claridge (1993),
who measured the pobf of 18 poag patients using a
combination of pilocarpine and  xxxd3377xxx , re-measured
the parameters 2 weeks after withdrawing pilocarpine
and again 1 week after reinstituting full treatment.
recordings from 20 patients receiving only  xxxd3377xxx  were
used as control values. there was no signiﬁcant change

in pobf when pilocarpine was withdrawn, despite a
signiﬁcant rise in iop, suggesting that pilocarpine had
no direct effect on pobf.
5.2. beta-blockers
drugs that bind to b receptors but do not activate
them are known as beta-adrenergic antagonists or betablockers. depending on the speciﬁcity for b1 or b2
receptors, beta-blockers are classiﬁed as non-selective
(when they bind with equal afﬁnity to both receptors) or
selective (when they show greater afﬁnity for a speciﬁc
receptor).
 xxxd3377xxx ,  xxxd2467xxx ,  xxxd2623xxx , and carteolol are
examples of non-selective beta-blockers, whereas betaxolol is a selective beta-blocker, with greater afﬁnity for
b1 receptors. all beta-blockers reduce iop by decreasing aqueous humor production by approximately 30–
50%. the exact mechanism involved in this inhibition is
unknown, although some authors suggest that b2
receptors are blocked in the non-pigmented ciliary body
epithelium, impairing aqueous humor production. b1
antagonists such as betaxolol would also be able to
inhibit b2 receptors (cross-receptor blocking), provided
that its concentration in the anterior segment is
sufﬁciently high (novak, 1987).
a number of studies have investigated the effects of
several beta-adrenergic blocking agents on obf, especially since it has been suggested that the blockade of b2
receptors may interfere with endogenous vasodilation
(collignon-brach, 1992), thus potentially adversely
affecting ocular circulation.
5.2.1.  xxxd3377xxx 
the ﬁrst beta-blocker to be routinely used in the
treatment of glaucoma was  xxxd3377xxx . since it
remains the gold standard to which all new antiglaucoma medications are compared to and because nonselective beta-blockers are felt to potentially have a
vasoconstrictive effect, the effects of  xxxd3377xxx  on all the
above-mentioned vascular beds were extensively investigated. animal studies, in vitro investigations, and
clinical trials including normal volunteers, ocular
hypertensive patients, poag and  xxxd2741xxx  patients that
will be described herein were never consistent enough to
indicate a pernicious effect of  xxxd3377xxx  on the
retinal, choroidal, or onh circulations. in fact, for each
study suggesting a possible deleterious effect, two other
reports indicate either no inﬂuence or even a beneﬁcial
effect of  xxxd3377xxx  on obf.
5.2.1.1. experimental studies. a classic study by van
buskirk et al. (1990) employing the microvascular
corrosion casting technique described vasoconstriction
of ciliary arteries in rabbit eyes induced by  xxxd3377xxx ,
betaxolol, and phenylephrine. the initial vasoconstric-

tive effect of  xxxd3377xxx  was less dramatic than that induced
by betaxolol and phenylephrine, but after 50 days of
treatment,  xxxd3377xxx  resulted in marked vasoconstriction.
reduced iris and ciliary body perfusion, detected by the
laser speckle or the microsphere methods, was also
described by other authors following the instillation of
 xxxd3377xxx  in rabbit eyes (watanabe and chiou, 1983;
tamaki et al., 1995). although other experimental
studies failed to demonstrate a  xxxd3377xxx -induced decrease
in anterior segment blood ﬂow in rabbit eyes (green and
hatchett, 1987; jay et al., 1994), chiou and chen (1992)
described a biphasic action of l- xxxd3377xxx  on the blood
ﬂow of the iris and ciliary body of rabbits using the
colored microsphere technique. an initial reduction in
blood ﬂow observed after 30 min was followed by a
marked increase later at 90 min and thereafter.
if there is an agreement that  xxxd3377xxx  may cause a
vasoconstriction of the anterior uvea in experimental
studies, the same does not hold true regarding posterior
segment blood ﬂow. while two experiments using
radiolabeled microspheres found decreased choroidal
blood ﬂow in arterially perfused bovine eyes (millar
et al., 1995) and ocular hypertensive rabbits (chiou and
chen, 1993) treated with  xxxd3377xxx , other studies employing the same technique indicated either no signiﬁcant
change (green and hatchett, 1987; chiou and chen,
1992; jay et al., 1994) or an improvement (chiou and
yan, 1986; jay et al., 1994) in retinal, choroidal, or
onh blood ﬂow of rabbits. the same trend (i.e. no
change or improvement) was observed in studies
employing the laser speckle method to detect modiﬁcations in choroidal and onh blood ﬂow in rabbits
(tamaki et al., 1997b, c; tomidokoro et al., 1999) and
monkeys (ishii and araie, 2000b). kiel and patel (1998)
employed laser doppler ﬂowmetry to demonstrate that
 xxxd3377xxx  does not alter the rabbit choroidal response to
acute changes in perfusion pressure. the same technique
was used by yan and chiou (1987), who described a
signiﬁcant reduction in the retinal blood ﬂow (17%) of
rabbits with l- xxxd3377xxx , but a slight improvement (9%)
with d- xxxd3377xxx . the microvasculature of the onh, was
investigated with the corrosion casting technique, by
orgul
. et al. (1995), who reported no observable optic
nerve vasomotor effects promoted by  xxxd3377xxx  in the
rabbit eye. finally, in vitro studies investigating the
direct effect of drugs on isolated segments of precontracted porcine long posterior ciliary arteries (hester
et al., 1994) or bovine retinal microarteries (hoste et al.,
1990) showed that  xxxd3377xxx  does not have a potent
relaxant effect, possibly because it lacks the ca2+antagonistic properties of other beta-blockers such as
betaxolol.
5.2.1.2. studies in healthy individuals and ocular hypertensive patients. the analysis of the effects of  xxxd3377xxx  on
the retinal, choroidal and onh circulations in healthy

781

subjects also give conﬂicting results. studies employing
ldv, laser doppler ﬂowmetry, or measurements of
pulsatile choroidal and optic disc blood ﬂow suggested
that  xxxd3377xxx  might be detrimental to the choroidal,
retinal, and epipapillary circulations (schmetterer et al.,
1997; yoshida et al., 1998; haeﬂiger et al., 1999). in
contrast, yoshida et al. (1991) in a double-masked,
placebo-controlled study using ldv, found that  xxxd3377xxx 
0.5% did not induce changes in retinal arterial blood
ﬂow rate or onh capillary blood velocity, ﬁndings that
were reproduced by ishikawa et al. (1996) with the laser
speckle method. netland et al. (1999) were unable to
detect onh blood ﬂow changes induced by  xxxd3377xxx  in
ocular hypertensive patients.
while some authors found that  xxxd3377xxx  had no effect
on the retinal circulation of ocular hypertensive patients
(wang et al., 1997), others have demonstrated increased
retinal blood ﬂow of normal volunteers and ocular
hypertensive patients employing ldv (grunwald, 1990,
1991), or measurements of the avp time (wolf et al.,
1989; arend et al., 1998). digital analysis of scanning
laser ﬂuorescein angiograms also demonstrated increased macular and epipapillary blood ﬂow velocities
following the instillation of  xxxd3377xxx  in healthy volunteers
(arend et al., 1998). according to some authors
(yoshida et al., 1991) pobf measurements in timololtreated eyes of normal individuals were found to
decrease, and to remain unchanged according to others
(yamazaki et al., 1992; sponsel et al., 2000); while cra
blood ﬂow velocities measured with cdi have been
shown to increase (steigerwalt et al., 1993, 2001) or to
remain unchanged (schmetterer et al., 1997) under
 xxxd3377xxx  therapy.
5.2.1.3. studies in glaucoma patients. as previously
mentioned, the obf response of glaucoma patients to
medications should be emphasized. some authors
reported the effects of  xxxd3377xxx  on the retinal circulation
of  xxxd2741xxx  patients (truckenbrodt et al., 1992) to be
negligible. however, this was an unmasked study
investigating the short-term (2-week) effect of  xxxd3377xxx 
0.5% on 31  xxxd2741xxx  patients with 2-point ﬂuorometry and
automatic measurement of arterial and venous diameters. a prospective, controlled study by lubeck et al.
(2001) concluded that no signiﬁcant change could be
detected in the onh circulation (measured with the
hrf) of 12 poag patients following  xxxd3377xxx  treatment
for 3 weeks. the same study investigated 12 age- and
sex-matched healthy volunteers, who received  xxxd3377xxx 
for the same period and did not show signiﬁcant changes
in onh blood ﬂow.
retrobulbar hemodynamic parameters (measured
with cdi) in patients with poag or  xxxd2741xxx  were found
to remain unchanged in  xxxd3377xxx -treated eyes by several
authors (harris et al., 1995c; nicolela et al., 1996a;
evans et al., 1999a, b). in a double-masked, crossover

article in press
782

v.p. costa et al. / progress in retinal and eye research 22 (2003) 769–805

study, harris et al. (1995c) observed that  xxxd3377xxx  did not
induce statistically signiﬁcant changes in cdi parameters of 13  xxxd2741xxx  patients at 1 month, following the use
of  xxxd3377xxx  0.5% twice daily. in another double-masked,
crossover study, nicolela et al. (1996a, b) also concluded
that 7 days of  xxxd3377xxx  treatment did not signiﬁcantly
alter the retrobulbar blood ﬂow of 9 poag and 6 ocular
hypertensive patients. only one study suggested that
 xxxd3377xxx  might be associated with a signiﬁcant increase in
the resistance index of the temporal spca, with no
change detected in other retrobulbar vessels (altanyaycioglu et al., 2001). this was a short-term (1 month)
study including a total of 40 poag patients, among
which 10 received  xxxd3377xxx  0.5%. conversely, bergstrand
et al. (2001) observed a signiﬁcant increase (41%) in the
edv and a signiﬁcant decrease in the ri (5.8%) of the
cra of 15 poag patients after 1 month of  xxxd3377xxx 
treatment. interestingly, the same authors were not able
to detect the same effect in 12 eyes with ocular
hypertension, suggesting the existence of a defective
autoregulation in poag patients.
pobf measurements in poag were not inﬂuenced
by  xxxd3377xxx  treatment according to the majority of the
studies (trew and smith, 1991; claridge and smith,
1994; morsman et al., 1995; vetrugno et al., 1998) with
the exception of one long-term, unmasked study, which
suggested that  xxxd3377xxx  was associated with reduced
pobf values (boles-carenini et al., 1994). pobf has
been recorded in 15 poag patients receiving  xxxd3377xxx 
0.25% in both the erect and supine positions, and
subsequently repeated 2 weeks after withdrawal of the
treatment (trew and smith, 1991). the authors found
no statistically signiﬁcant differences in pobf between
the treated and untreated phases of the study. claridge
and smith (1994) measured the pobf at 3-hourly
intervals over a 24-h period in 10 ocular hypertensives, 8
patients with poag and 8 control subjects. all poag
patients were on  xxxd3377xxx  tretament. in this group,
measurements were also made 2 weeks after discontinuing  xxxd3377xxx  for 2 weeks, a wash-out period inferior to the
4 weeks recommended for beta-blockers. similar to the
previous study, the authors observed that when  xxxd3377xxx 
was withdrawn from poag subjects, there was no
change in pobf despite an increase in iop, suggesting
that  xxxd3377xxx  did not result in pobf changes.
5.2.2. betaxolol
the hypothesis that betaxolol, a selective betablocker, could improve obf by avoiding non-selective
beta-blocker-induced vasoconstriction has led several
authors to investigate the effects of this drug on various
vascular beds, both in vitro and in vivo.
5.2.2.1. experimental studies. the laser speckle method
showed signiﬁcant increases in tissue blood ﬂow velocity
in the iris and onh of albino rabbits following 20-day

treatment with betaxolol 0.5% bid (araie and muta,
1997). betaxolol was also found to inhibit the reduction
in choroidal blood ﬂow induced by et-1 injections in
the vitreous of albino rabbits (kim et al., 2002), and to
increase ciliary body and retinal blood ﬂow of rabbits as
measured with the hydrogen clearance method (sato
et al., 2001). segments of bovine retinal microarteries
and porcine long posterior ciliary arteries were mounted
in an organ bath perfused with betaxolol for measurement of contractile forces (hoste and sys, 1994; hester
et al., 1994). both experiments demonstrated that
betaxolol is capable of reducing k+-induced contractions in a dose-dependent manner, possibly by inhibiting
voltage-gated ca2+ entry in vascular smooth muscle.
however, a high concentration of betaxolol (104 m)
was required for this effect to be observed. in a welldesigned study intended to measure choroidal blood
ﬂow employing laser doppler ﬂowmetry following acute
changes in perfusion pressure of rabbits, kiel and patel
(1998) reported that a single drop of betaxolol 0.5% did
not alter the choroidal response to acute changes in
perfusion pressure. finally, although treatment with
either  xxxd3377xxx  or betaxolol has resulted in marked
vasoconstriction of the arteries that supply the ciliary
body or rabbit eyes (van buskirk et al., 1990), the
examination of the microvasculature of the optic nerve
with an icc technique was unable to detect any
vasomotor effects of a long-term treatment with these
drugs in the rabbit model (orgul
. et al., 1995).
5.2.2.2. studies in healthy individuals and ocular hypertensive patients. studies investigating the acute effects of
betaxolol instillation in healthy humans tended to show
no signiﬁcant change in retinal circulation as measured
by the laser speckle method (ishikawa et al., 1996;
tamaki et al., 1997a), oodg (pillunat and stodrmeister, 1988), the blue ﬁeld entoptic phenomenon (harris
et al., 1995b), or the hrf (haeﬂiger et al., 1999). in
contrast, two studies documented increased retinal
blood ﬂow following the use of betaxolol in healthy
volunteers. arend et al. (1998) observed a 25%
reduction in avp time and a 20% increase in macular
and epipapillary blood velocities not only with betaxolol, but also with  xxxd3377xxx  and  xxxd2467xxx . in a doublemasked, placebo-controlled, randomized study, schmetterer et al. (1997), did not observe statistically signiﬁcant
changes in either pulsatile choroidal and onh blood
ﬂow, or in the retrobulbar hemodynamic parameters
(measured by cdi) in healthy volunteers treated with
betaxolol. however, chronic use (2–3 weeks) of betaxolol has been shown to improve both retinal and onh
blood ﬂow (yoshida et al., 1998; tamaki et al., 1999b).
in ocular hypertensive patients, betaxolol was found
to improve cra hemodynamic parameters measured
with cdi (steigerwalt et al., 2001). gupta et al. (1994)
demonstrated a statistically signiﬁcant increase in the

article in press
v.p. costa et al. / progress in retinal and eye research 22 (2003) 769–805

retinal blood ﬂow of a major temporal vein 2 h following
the instillation of the drug in 10 ocular hypertensive
subjects in a randomized, placebo-controlled study.
5.2.2.3. studies in glaucoma patients. morsman et al.
(1995) performed pobf measurements in 21 poag and
12 ocular hypertensive patients randomly assigned to
receive  xxxd3377xxx , betaxolol or  xxxd2467xxx  twice daily for
1 week. the measurements were performed, by a
masked investigator, at baseline, and 2 h after administration. compared to baseline, there was a 22% increase
in pobf values after  xxxd2467xxx  administration
(p ¼ 0:02), a 23% reduction after betaxolol administration (p ¼ 0:04), and no statistically signiﬁcant change
after  xxxd3377xxx  use. the authors were unable to correlate
these ﬁndings with changes in iop or blood pressure.
in a long-term study, boles-carenini et al. (1994)
compared the effects of  xxxd3377xxx  and betaxolol on the
pobf of 25 poag patients. during the 12 months of
follow-up, betaxolol (n ¼ 14) was found to maintain
stable pobf measurements, whereas  xxxd3377xxx  (n ¼ 11)
resulted in a statistically signiﬁcant reduction. the iop
lowering efﬁcacy of both drugs were not statistically
different, and, thus, could not explain the ﬁndings.
however, the examiner was not masked to patient
treatment, and the washout period from previous betablocker therapy was only 15 days.
harris et al. (2000) were unable to detect a statistically
signiﬁcant change in avp time or cdi parameters in
the oa and cra following the use of betaxolol for 1
month in 9  xxxd2741xxx  patients. in a double-masked, crossover study, cdi measurements of the retrobulbar blood
ﬂow velocity of 13  xxxd2741xxx  patients were performed
following a 1-month treatment with  xxxd3377xxx  and
betaxolol (harris et al., 1995c). there was no signiﬁcant
change in the hemodynamic parameters of all analyzed
vessels after  xxxd3377xxx  or betaxolol treatment. however,
when the four-vessel average resistance index was
calculated, a statistically signiﬁcant decrease induced
by betaxolol was detected.
in an unmasked study, without placebo control,
betaxolol was found to signiﬁcantly reduce the resistance index of the oa of 18  xxxd2741xxx  patients after 1 year of
twice-daily bilateral instillation (turacli et al., 1998). in
another prospective, randomized trial, betaxolol 0.5%
signiﬁcantly reduced the resistance index of the cra
and temporal spca of 10 poag patients 1 month after
treatment (altan-yaycioglu et al., 2001).
other investigators identiﬁed an improvement of
retrobulbar hemodynamic parameters promoted by
betaxolol in 11 poag patients with ocular vasospasm,
deﬁned as a statistically signiﬁcant increase in oa blood
ﬂow velocity or a signiﬁcant decrease in oa resistance
index during hypercapnia (evans et al., 1999a, b). this
was a double-masked, crossover study that compared
the effects of a 4-week treatment period with betaxolol

783

or  xxxd3377xxx  on cdi measurements and contrast sensitivity. the authors reported no statistically signiﬁcant
change in retrobulbar hemodynamics or visual function
with  xxxd3377xxx , but did observe a statistically signiﬁcant
decrease in the oa resistance index (p ¼ 0:04), a
statistically signiﬁcant improvement in contrast sensitivity (p ¼ 0:006), and a positive correlation between
change in contrast sensitivity and oa resistance index
(r ¼ 0:70; p ¼ 0:15) with betaxolol treatment.
5.2.3.  xxxd2467xxx 
 xxxd2467xxx  is another non-selective beta-blocker
with a unique characteristic. once administered,  xxxd2467xxx  is converted by the corneal epithelium and
ciliary body into an active polar metabolite known as
dihydrolevobunolol (di carlo et al., 1977). it has been
suggested that the polarity of this metabolite may inhibit
its diffusion into the retina and choroid, theoretically
inducing less vasoconstriction in these vascular beds
than other beta-blockers. as previously mentioned,
experimental studies conﬁrm that  xxxd2467xxx  and its
metabolite are found in a statistically signiﬁcantly lower
concentration than  xxxd3377xxx  in the choroid/retina and
onh (acheampong et al., 1995).
5.2.3.1. experimental studies. the only experimental
study evaluating the obf effects of  xxxd2467xxx  was
performed by chiou and chen (1993), who employed
labeled microspheres and found that all beta-blockers
tested (betaxolol,  xxxd2467xxx ,  xxxd2623xxx , and  xxxd3377xxx ) tended to decrease obf in ocular hypertensive
rabbits.
5.2.3.2. studies in healthy individuals and ocular hypertensive patients. in humans,  xxxd2467xxx  0.5% was
shown to result in a statistically signiﬁcant increase in
pobf measurements in healthy volunteers 2 h after a
single dosage instillation (bosem et al., 1992), however,
ogasawara et al. (1999), were unable to reproduce these
ﬁndings. the data available on the effects of  xxxd2467xxx 
on the retinal circulation are also inconsistent. although
some authors described an improvement in retinal and
onh blood ﬂow measured with the hrf (ogasawara
et al., 1999) or by digital image analysis of scanning laser
ﬂuorescein angiograms (arend et al., 1998), studies
employing blue entoptic simulation and ldv failed to
detect a similar effect (harris et al., 1995b; leung and
grunwald, 1997; bloom et al., 1997). finally,  xxxd2467xxx  was found not to inﬂuence choroidal, onh or
retrobulbar blood ﬂow after a single instillation in
healthy subjects (schmetterer et al., 1997).
5.2.3.3. studies in glaucoma patients. in a randomized,
double-masked, placebo-controlled study, bosem et al.
(1992) reported a statistically signiﬁcant increase
(13.3%, po0:006) in pobf 2 h after the instillation of

v.p. costa et al. / progress in retinal and eye research 22 (2003) 769–805

 xxxd2467xxx  in 14 poag patients. however, a simultaneous 28% decrease in iop was observed, but the
authors failed to investigate a possible correlation
between iop reduction and pobf improvement.
in a study including 21 poag and 12 ocular
hypertensive patients, morsman et al. (1995) observed
a 22% increase in pobf values after 1 week of
 xxxd2467xxx  administration (p ¼ 0:02), a change that
was not correlated with iop or blood pressure changes.
in a prospective trial of 40 poag patients, altanyaycioglu et al. (2001) compared the retrobulbar
hemodynamic effects of  xxxd2467xxx ,  xxxd3377xxx , carteolol,
and betaxolol. at the end of the ﬁrst month of treatment
with  xxxd2467xxx , the authors did not disclose statistically signiﬁcant changes in cdi parameters in the oa,
cra, and spca.
5.2.4. carteolol
carteolol is a non-selective beta-adrenergic blocking
agent with partial beta-agonistic activity, known as
intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (isa). the contribution of isa to beta-blocker therapeutic potential has
been studied extensively for systemic hypertension, with
inconclusive results (taylor, 1987). although a betablocker with isa might be expected to theoretically
decrease peripheral vascular resistance and improve
blood ﬂow, no deﬁnitive data supports this hypothesis.
similarly, the effectiveness of the isa of carteolol in
improving obf is questionable.
5.2.4.1. experimental studies. experimental studies employing the laser speckle method revealed increased blood
ﬂow velocities in the iris, with no change in the choroidal
or onh circulation of rabbits following a single instillation of carteolol 2% (tamaki et al., 1998; tomidokoro
et al., 1999). however, after a 20-day treatment with
carteolol 2%, a statistically signiﬁcant increase in the
onh blood velocity was measured in rabbit eyes with
the same method, both in the treated (15% increase) and
contralateral eyes (11%) (tamaki et al., 1998). another
study in rabbits demonstrated that continuous intravenous injection of carteolol (5 mg/kg/h) was effective in
increasing the onh blood ﬂow as measured with the
hydrogen clearance method (sugiyama et al., 1998). in
contrast to these ﬁndings, millar et al. (1995) reported
marked reduction of perfusion in the iris, ciliary body and
choroid (measured with radiolabeled microspheres) induced by carteolol in arterially perfused bovine eyes,
whereas sato et al. (2001) showed reduced ciliary body,
choroidal and retinal blood ﬂow in rabbits using the
hydrogen clearance method. an in vitro study that
evaluated the contractile forces in segments of porcine
long posterior ciliary arteries demonstrated that carteolol
was signiﬁcantly less effective than betaxolol in promoting
relaxation of vascular smooth muscle (hester et al., 1994).
such ﬁndings were conﬁrmed by brogiolo et al. (2002),

who observed that porcine ciliary arteries precontracted
with kcl were relaxed by high concentrations of
carteolol, an effect modulated by extracellular ca2+.
5.2.4.2. studies in healthy individuals and ocular hypertensive patients. in humans, the use of carteolol in
healthy individuals was found to result in a statistically
signiﬁcant increase of pobf measurements (yamazaki
et al., 1992; yamazaki and baba, 1993). the laser
speckle method was used in 6 normal individuals after a
single instillation of carteolol 2%, and disclosed a
statistically signiﬁcant increase in onh blood ﬂow
velocities (tamaki et al., 1998). carteolol promoted a
marked increase in the peak systolic and end diastolic
velocities of the oa (determined by cdi), and a
statistically signiﬁcant increase in the blood ﬂow volume
of the peripapillary retina of normal human eyes
(mizuki and yamazaki, 2000).
on the other hand, two independent, double-masked,
placebo-controlled studies investigating the effect of
carteolol on the normal retinal circulation employing
the blue ﬁeld entoptic phenomenon (harris et al., 1995b)
and ldv (grunwald and delehanty, 1992) failed to
demonstrate any change induced by this drug. finally,
retinal and ciliary perfusion pressures of 10 healthy
individuals were found to signiﬁcantly decrease with a
single drop of carteolol (pillunat and stodrmeister,
1988).
steigerwalt et al. (2001) evaluated the effect of topical
 xxxd3377xxx  0.5%, betaxolol 0.5% and carteolol 2% on the
blood ﬂow velocity of the oa, cra, and spca in 14
patients with ocular hypertension. the authors described statistically signiﬁcant increases in the cra
peak systolic velocity for all 3 drugs, and a statistically
signiﬁcant increase in the cra end diastolic velocity for
 xxxd3377xxx  and carteolol.
5.2.4.3. studies in glaucoma patients. altan-yaycioglu
et al. (2001) described a statistically signiﬁcant decrease
in the resistance index of the cra of 10 poag patients
following the use of carteolol 1% for 1 month.
montanari et al. (2001) reported the results of an
unmasked study comparing the inﬂuence of  xxxd3377xxx  and
carteolol on the retrobulbar hemodynamics of 20 poag
patients. all patients received  xxxd3377xxx  0.5% initially,
followed by 6 months of therapy with carteolol 2%.
although no statistically signiﬁcant changes were
detected for iop measurements, the authors observed
a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in the resistance index
of the spca following the use of carteolol (p ¼ 0:017).
5.3. alpha-agonists
5.3.1.  xxxd201xxx 
 xxxd201xxx  hydrochloride is an amino derivative
of clonidine and a relatively selective a2 agonist with

article in press
v.p. costa et al. / progress in retinal and eye research 22 (2003) 769–805

minimal adverse systemic cardiovascular effects.  xxxd201xxx  is less lipophilic than clonidine, which
decreases its penetration through the blood-brain
barrier and reduces the occurrence of cns-mediated
side effects.  xxxd201xxx  lowers iop by reducing
aqueous humor production up to 35%, without altering
aqueous outﬂow. the mechanisms involved in the
reduction of aqueous humor production are not
completely understood, although it is felt that part of
its effect may be secondary to vasoconstriction of the
ciliary body (torris et al., 1995b). while a2 agonists
reduce iop, the presence of vasoconstrictor postsynaptic a2 receptors on vascular smooth muscle raise the
possibility that these drugs may compromise obf.
5.3.1.1. experimental studies. in the anterior segment,
topical  xxxd201xxx  1% produces constriction of precapillary sphincters in the vessels supplying the ciliary
body (fahrenbach et al., 1989). a study using labeled
microspheres in monkeys demonstrated reduced blood
ﬂow in the anterior tissues, but unchanged blood ﬂow in
the retina, choroid, and optic nerve (chandler and
desantis, 1985). another experimental study employing
the langham obf instrument showed no change in
peak pulse volume of glaucomatous monkey eyes
treated with topical  xxxd201xxx  1% (mittag et al.,
1994).
5.3.1.2. studies in healthy individuals and ocular hypertensive patients. in humans,  xxxd201xxx  was found to
cause conjunctival vasoconstriction (robin, 1988;
serdahl et al., 1989) and to lower conjunctival oxygen
tension by 76% 1 h following instillation (serdahl et al.,
1989). the results of studies investigating the inﬂuence
of  xxxd201xxx  on the retrobulbar circulation are
conﬂicting. in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, harris et al. (1995a) showed that  xxxd201xxx  0.5% was effective in reducing the iop of 13
healthy subjects, but had no effect on retrobulbar blood
ﬂow (as measured with cdi). on the other hand, other
double-masked studies (oruc and sener, 1999; celiker
et al., 1996) indicated decreased blood ﬂow velocities
and increased resistivity indices in the oa following the
administration of a single dose of  xxxd201xxx  1% in
healthy individuals, with no detectable change in the
cra.
changes in the retinal circulation of healthy individuals were not detected following the instillation of
 xxxd201xxx  as measured with the blue-ﬁeld entoptic
simulation (harris et al., 1995a) or laser doppler
ﬂowmetry (kim and dim, 1997). mittag et al. (1994)
and coworkers measured the ocular pulse amplitude
following the instillation of  xxxd201xxx  1% in six
ocular hypertensive patients, and found a statistically
signiﬁcant decrease only 4 h after dosing compared to
the placebo-treated contralateral eye.

785

5.3.1.3. studies in glaucoma patients. in a doublemasked, randomized clinical trial, avunduk et al.
(2001) investigated the retrobulbar hemodynamic effects
of topical betaxolol,  xxxd1931xxx , and  xxxd201xxx  in
22 newly diagnosed poag patients. patients receiving
 xxxd201xxx  (n ¼ 8) for 1 month showed a statistically
signiﬁcant decrease in the psv in the oa (p ¼ 0:012)
and had a statistically signiﬁcant lower edv in the oa
compared to the other groups (po0:05), suggesting a
possible deleterious effect in the retrobulbar circulation.
5.3.2. brimonidine
brimonidine is a less lipophilic analog of clonidine
that provides clinically signiﬁcant lowering of iop.
brimonidine is a potent a-adrenoceptor agonist that is
1000-fold more selective for a2 vs. the a1 adrenoceptor,
7–12-fold more a2 selective than clonidine and 23–32fold more a2 selective than  xxxd201xxx  (torris et al.,
1995a). the majority of animal and human studies
discussed below suggest a lack of inﬂuence of brimonidine on retinal, choroidal, or onh blood ﬂow.
5.3.2.1. experimental studies. bhandari et al. (1999)
performed a placebo-controlled study in rabbits to
investigate the inﬂuence of brimonidine tartrate 0.2%
on the optic nerve blood ﬂow by means of intraluminal
microvascular corrosion casting technique and intravascular injection of colored microspheres. after 4 weeks of
treatment with brimonidine, there was no statistically
signiﬁcant difference in the average constriction of
short posterior ciliary arterial branches between the
treated and control groups. similarly, no statistically
signiﬁcant difference was found between the optic
nerve blood ﬂow, measured with microspheres in both
groups.
5.3.2.2. studies in healthy individuals and ocular
hypertensive patients. randomized, double-masked,
placebo-controlled studies investigating the effects of
brimonidine on the retinal circulation (as measured with
scanning laser doppler ﬂowmetry and the slo)
(carlsson et al., 2000; jonescu-cuypers et al., 2001)
and retrobulbar blood ﬂow (determined with cdi)
(lachkar et al., 1998; jonescu-cuypers et al., 2001) of
normal individuals and ocular hypertensive patients
failed to demonstrate a statistically signiﬁcant change in
these vascular beds.
5.3.2.3. studies in glaucoma patients. an open-label
study including 10 poag patients followed for 6
months revealed that brimonidine 0.2% was effective
in reducing iop and increasing pobf from 9.2% (at
day 180) to 22.5% (at day 30) (vetrugno et al., 2001).
however, in a double-masked, randomized, prospective
study, sponsel et al. (2002a) were unable to observe a
statistically signiﬁcant effect of brimonidine on the

article in press
786

v.p. costa et al. / progress in retinal and eye research 22 (2003) 769–805

pobf of 20 patients with poag or ocular hypertension
treated for 4 weeks.
in a comparative study that included 72 poag
patients receiving betaxolol (n ¼ 24),  xxxd367xxx 
(n ¼ 24), or brimonidine (n ¼ 24), scanning laser doppler ﬂowmetry was employed to measure the onh
blood ﬂow (sampaolesi et al., 2001). the authors
concluded that neither drug had the ability to increase
onh blood ﬂow.
5.4. prostaglandin analogues
5.4.1.  xxxd2446xxx 
 xxxd2446xxx  is a lipophilic, esteriﬁed pro-drug, which
is inactive until it undergoes enzymatic hydrolysis in the
cornea, becoming the biologically active acid of
 xxxd2446xxx .  xxxd2446xxx  is a prostaglandin f2a analogue that lowers iop by increasing uveoscleral outﬂow
(serle et al., 1998). since many naturally occurring
prostaglandins have marked effects on the cardiovascular system, it is conceivable that synthetic prostaglandins may exert microvascular effects in the eye.
5.4.1.1. experimental studies. the effects of  xxxd2446xxx 
0.005% on regional blood ﬂow in monkey eyes were
measured with radioactively labeled microspheres.
following the instillation of a single dose containing
6 mg/g of  xxxd2446xxx , no statistically signiﬁcant change
in regional blood ﬂow was observed up to 6 h after the
administration, with the exception of the anterior sclera,
in which a moderate increase in blood ﬂow was detected
(stjernschantz et al., 1999).  xxxd2446xxx  has been shown
to cause anterior segment vasodilation in cats, with no
change in blood volume or ﬂow in other ocular tissues
(stjernschantz et al., 2000). astin et al. (1994) reported
that the vasodilation observed in the conjunctiva,
anterior sclera and anterior uvea of rabbits following
the instillation of  xxxd1902xxx  was partly mediated by nitric
oxide synthase.
the laser speckle analyzer was employed to determine
that combined 6-day instillation of  xxxd3377xxx  and  xxxd2446xxx  had no effect on the retinal blood ﬂow, but
signiﬁcantly increased onh blood ﬂow in monkeys
(ishii and araie, 2000a). a similar increase was
described following the instillation of  xxxd2446xxx  in
rabbits and monkeys (ishii et al., 2001). however,
 xxxd2446xxx  has recently been found to promote a dosedependent contraction of quiescent porcine ciliary
arteries (maximum: 6873%), and was not able to evoke
relaxation of kcl or entothelin-1 precontracted vessels
(brogiolo et al., 2001).
5.4.1.2. studies in healthy individuals and ocular hypertensive patients. two double-masked, placebo-controlled studies indicated that  xxxd2446xxx  produces an
increase in pobf in normal individuals (geyer et al.,

2001; sponsel et al., 2002a, b), a ﬁnding that was not
conﬁrmed by a similarly well-designed study (kuba
et al., 2001). another randomized, double-masked study
demonstrated that  xxxd2446xxx  caused no statistically
signiﬁcant change in retinal, onh or peripapillary ﬂow
as measured with the hrf 24 h after the instillation of a
single dose in 26 healthy volunteers (seong et al., 1999).
on the other hand, other authors (ishii et al., 2001;
tamaki et al., 2001a) reported an increase in onh
blood velocity (as measured with the laser speckle
method) of normal individuals following a single
instillation or a 7-day once-daily regimen of  xxxd2446xxx .
regarding the retrobulbar circulation,  xxxd2446xxx  was
found to have no effect on cdi parameters of normal
individuals (tamaki et al., 2001a).
5.4.1.3. studies in glaucoma patients. there are relatively few studies that have evaluated the effect of
prostaglandin analogues on obf of glaucoma subjects.
in a double-masked crossover study, nicolela et al.
(1996a, b) were the ﬁrst to compare the effects of topical
 xxxd3377xxx  and  xxxd2446xxx  on retrobulbar vessel blood ﬂow
velocity in 15 patients with poag or ocular hypertension using cdi. the only statistically signiﬁcant change
observed in retrobulbar blood ﬂow velocity with  xxxd3377xxx 
was a reduction of edv in the oa 12 h after the ﬁrst
dose, a change that was not observed 7 days later. no
change in blood velocity was observed with  xxxd2446xxx .
overall, topical  xxxd3377xxx  and  xxxd2446xxx  produced
statistically signiﬁcant reduction in iop without creating
substantial hemodynamic changes in the retrobulbar
vessels.
vetrugno et al. (1998) compared the effect of
 xxxd2446xxx  and  xxxd3377xxx  on 12 poag patients (24 eyes)
followed for 6 months with the pobf system. each
patient had one eye treated with  xxxd2446xxx  0.005%
and the other with  xxxd3377xxx  0.05%. in the latanoprosttreated eyes, pobf values increased by as much as
55.8% in the ﬁrst day and then settled at 22.6% at the
end of the study.  xxxd3377xxx  showed a similar pressure
progress, but its haematic perfusion values were
distinctly lower.
mckibbin and menage (1999) studied the effect of 3–
4 weeks once-daily 0.005%  xxxd2446xxx  on the iop and
pobf in 32 eyes of 19  xxxd2741xxx  patients. the iop reduction
correlated with the initial iop before treatment and was
accompanied by a statistically signiﬁcant increase in
median pobf from 656 to 796 ml/min (po0:001).
georgopoulos et al. (2002) investigated the effect of
topical  xxxd2446xxx  on pobf in 20 poag and 4 ocular
hypertensive subjects in a prospective, open-label study.
after 1 week of  xxxd2446xxx  treatment, pobf measurements increased statistically signiﬁcantly by 201.27
167.4 ml/min in od (po0:001) and 203.87187.3 ml/min
in os (po0:001). ocular pulse amplitude and ocular
pulse volume showed statistically signiﬁcant increases

article in press
v.p. costa et al. / progress in retinal and eye research 22 (2003) 769–805

(po0:05 and po0:001; respectively). recently, liu et al.
(2002) compared the effect of brimonidine tartrate 0.2%
and  xxxd2446xxx  0.005% on pobf in 25  xxxd2741xxx  subjects.
in their randomized, investigator masked, crossover
study, each patient received 4 weeks each of  xxxd2446xxx ,
lubricant, and brimonidine. in this study,  xxxd2446xxx 
increased pobf by 2137257 ml/min (22.8%, po0:001)
while brimonidine increased it by 977183 ml/min
(10.4%, p ¼ 0:014). also, pobf increased at 8 am
(p ¼ 0:004), 12 noon (p ¼ 0:002), and 4 pm (po0:001)
with  xxxd2446xxx , while it only increased at 8 am
(p ¼ 0:016) with brimonidine. after adjusting for
changes in iop, neither  xxxd2446xxx  nor brimonidine
increased pobf statistically signiﬁcantly.
5.4.2. unoprostone isopropyl
unoprostone isopropyl is a derivative of a prostaglandin metabolite. it is classiﬁed as a docosanoid,
contains 22 carbon atoms and a keto group at c-15,
whereas  xxxd2446xxx  and primary prostaglandins are
classiﬁed as eicosanoids, with 20 carbon atoms and a
hydroxyl group at c-15. unoprostone is hydrolyzed
during its passage through the cornea by esterases,
resulting in a free carboxylic acid, which is the
pharmacologically active substance. there is not enough
experimental evidence to conclusively deﬁne the way
unoprostone exerts its iop lowering effect. some
authors reported an increase in aqueous outﬂow via
the conventional (trabecular) pathway, whereas others
speculated that unoprostone might increase outﬂow via
the uveoscleral or via both uveoscleral and conventional
pathways (taniguchi et al., 1996; serle et al., 1998).
5.4.2.1. experimental studies. several animal studies
have investigated the effect of unoprostone on obf.
in one experiment employing the hydrogen gas clearance ﬂowmeter (sugiyama and azuma, 1995), the effect
of  xxxg674xxx , applied to the rabbit eye in order to
cause vasoconstiction, was signiﬁcantly reduced 2.5 and
3.5 h after the intravitreal injection of 10 ml of unoprostone 0.06%, with no signiﬁcant reduction in iop. in a
subsequent study (sugiyama and azuma, 1997), the
same authors reported that the  xxxg674xxx -induced
blood ﬂow reduction was inhibited in a dose-dependent
manner following the instillation of 1 drop of unoprostone 0.03%, 0.06% and 0.012%. however, this study
did not investigate changes in iop, not elucidating
whether the observed blood ﬂow effect was secondary to
an iop lowering effect.
similar antiendothelin-1 effects were described by yu
et al. (2001), who investigated the results of intraluminal
and extraluminal administration of unoprostone isopropyl and its free acid to segments of perfused porcine
retinal arterioles. increasing doses of unoprostone and
its free acid (1010–104 mm) were shown to inhibit the
vasoconstrictive effect of et-1.

787

5.4.2.2. studies in healthy individuals and ocular hypertensive patients. in a placebo-controlled, randomized,
double-masked study,  xxxg674xxx  (2.5 ng/kg/min for
150 min) was administered intravenously to 24 healthy
individuals (polska et al., 2002). after the instillation of
10 drops of unoprostone in 90 min, subfoveal and
pulsatle choroidal blood ﬂow were measured using laser
doppler ﬂowmetry and laser interferometric assessment
of fundus pulsation amplitude, respectively. the authors
demonstrated that unoprostone was effective in inhibiting the decrease in both choroidal blood ﬂow and
pulsation amplitudes induced by  xxxg674xxx .
kojima et al. (1997) utilized the laser speckle method
to examine changes in the onh and choroid-retinal
circulation of 9 normal human eyes following the
instillation of unoprostone 0.12%. although no change
was observed in the onh circulation, there was a
statistically signiﬁcant increase (8–11%) in the choroidretinal blood ﬂow. double-masked, placebo-controlled
studies employing the same method in healthy individuals demonstrated that chronic administration of
unoprostone 0.12% was effective in increasing both
onh and choroid-retinal blood ﬂow (makimoto et al.,
2000; tamaki et al., 2001b).
in a small, unmasked study, cdi was used to measure
the retrobulbar blood ﬂow of healthy individuals after a
single dose of unoprostone 0.12% (nishimura and
okamoto, 1998). the authors reported increased peak
systolic and end diastolic blood ﬂow velocities in the
cra and spca with no change in pulsatility indices.
on the other hand, tamaki et al. (2001b) did not report
a statistically signiﬁcant change in the cra hemodynamic parameters of normal volunteers following the
instillation of unoprostone 0.12% for 7 days. in a
double-masked, placebo-controlled study, pobf measurements were not found to increase statistically
signiﬁcantly after the instillation of unoprostone
0.12% in 9 healthy volunteers (kitaya et al., 1997).
5.4.2.3. studies in glaucoma patients. only three studies
evaluated the effects of unoprostone on the obf of
patients with glaucoma. an unmasked study in a small
population (n ¼ 14) of  xxxd2741xxx  patients suggested that
chronic administration of unoprostone 0.12% was not
effective in changing the hemodynamic parameters of
the entire study population. when a post-hoc analysis
was performed in a subgroup of  xxxd2741xxx  patients with
early stage disease, the peak systolic velocities of the oa
were found to have signiﬁcantly increased statistically
(nishimura and okamoto, 1998).
sponsel et al. (2002a) recently compared the effect on
pobf between topical 0.005%  xxxd2446xxx  (given to one
eye once daily) and 0.15% unoprostone (twice daily in
the contralateral eye) in 25 bilateral open-angle glaucoma or glaucoma suspect patients. pobf increased 30%
relative to baseline in eyes receiving  xxxd2446xxx 

article in press
788

v.p. costa et al. / progress in retinal and eye research 22 (2003) 769–805

(po0:0001), and 16% in eyes receiving unoprostone
(p ¼ 0:05) by the morning of day 28. that afternoon,
mean pobf increased 30% (po0:0001) relative to
afternoon baseline values among eyes receiving  xxxd2446xxx  and 18% (p ¼ 0:03) among those receiving
unoprostone (interdrug change difference, p ¼ 0:05).
however, it should be mentioned that there was a
statistically greater iop reduction in those eyes receiving
 xxxd2446xxx  compared to unoprostone, which may have
inﬂuenced the results.
beano et al. (2001) evaluated unoprostone’s obf
effect on glaucoma subjects using laser doppler
ﬂowmetry. in a prospective, randomized, observermasked, crossover, placebo-controlled trial, they evaluated 12 vasospastic  xxxd2741xxx  subjects at baseline and after
1 week of treatment. no statistically signiﬁcant difference was found between unoprostone and placebo with
respect to choroidal or onh blood ﬂow.
5.5. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
cais are non-bacteriostatic sulphonamide-derivatives
effective in the control of ﬂuid secretions in various
parts of the body. many isoenzymes of ca are found
throughout the body.  xxxg287xxx ,  xxxg293xxx , and  xxxg295xxx  are
considered to be most pertinent to the eye.  xxxg287xxx  and
 xxxg293xxx  are present in the corneal endothelium, while only
 xxxg293xxx  is present in the ciliary process and the retina
(wistrand and garg, 1979; dobbs et al., 1979; hageman
et al., 1991). studies have consistently shown that
inhibiting  xxxg293xxx  within the eye, in normal and
glaucomatous persons, reduces the rate of aqueous
humor secretion and results in a statistically signiﬁcant
iop reduction (brubaker, 1989; becker, 1955; carprioli,
1992; wang et al., 1991; yamazaki et al., 1994).
secretion of aqueous humor by non-pigmented
epithelium of the ciliary processes depends on  xxxg293xxx 
for providing bicarbonate (hco
3 ), utilized by active
atpases to shuttle solutes (i.e. na+) into the posterior
chamber with water passively following (wax et al.,
1997; macknight et al., 2000). blockade of  xxxg293xxx 
reduces aqueous humor production (and iop) by
decreasing available hco
3 and the activity of atpases
in the ciliary body epithelium.
5.5.1. acetazolamide
acetazolamide, an orally active systemic cai, is the
prototype cai and selectively inhibits ca in red blood
cells, glial cells, capillary endothelium, and choroid
plexus. in 1954, it was ﬁrst reported that orally
administered acetazolamide lowered the iop of glaucoma patients (becker, 1954). serious side effects (epstein
and grant, 1977; clineschmidt et al., 1998; hutzelmann
et al., 1998) of systemic cais, however, have led to the
development of topical cais.

intravenous injections (iv) of acetazolamide have
long been used to estimate cerebral vasoreactivity
(volstrup et al., 1986; sullivan et al., 1987; volstrup,
1988; rogg et al., 1989; kuroda et al., 1993). systemic
ca inhibition also results in altered co2 clearance and
tissue ph levels (sponsel and shipman, 1997). an
increase in tissue pco2 may promote local control
activation and an increased bohr effect, resulting in
local vasodilation, although many other pathways can
lead to cerebral vasodilation. several investigators have
conﬁrmed that acetazolamide is capable of increasing
cerebral blood ﬂow in a dose-dependent manner (hauge
et al., 1983; ringelstein et al., 1992), which may, at least
in part, be attributed to extracellular acidiﬁcation
(severinghaus and cotev, 1968; volstrup et al., 1984;
faraci et al., 1987; volstrup, 1988; sponsel and
shipman, 1997).
5.5.1.1. experimental studies. in 1993, chiou and chen
performed an experimental study in ocular hypertensive
rabbits receiving different antiglaucoma medications
and measured ocular tissue blood ﬂow with the microsphere method. acetazolamide was found to produce a
statistically signiﬁcant increase in retinal and choroidal
blood ﬂow.
5.5.1.2. studies in healthy individuals and ocular hypertensive patients. in 1993, rassam et al. employed ldv
and computerized digital image analysis of monochromatic fundus photographs to demonstrate that a 500 mg
iv dose of acetazolamide statistically signiﬁcantly
increased retinal blood ﬂow in healthy volunteers. kerty
et al. (1994) demonstrated that iv acetazolamide
affected retrobulbar blood ﬂow velocity, using transcranial and transorbital doppler ultrasonography and
dynamic tonometry. the authors showed that 1 g iv
acetazolamide resulted in statistically signiﬁcantly increased blood ﬂow velocities through the internal
carotid and middle cerebral arteries, while blood ﬂow
velocity in the oa was signiﬁcantly decreased in healthy
patients. changes in blood ﬂow velocity in the oa may
have been induced by an autoregulatory response to
maintain constant obf. however, this supposition
cannot be answered with velocity measurements alone
but requires concurrent knowledge of vessel diameter
measurements, as used in the previously mentioned
study by rassam et al. (1993).
previous publications did not ﬁnd alterations in the
hemodynamic parameters of the oa or cra after
treatment with an oral 1 g dose of acetazolamide alone
(ehrenreich et al., 1961; harris et al., 1996b), although
harris et al. (1996a, b) observed a statistically signiﬁcant
decrease in the cra resistance index when co2 was
used in addition to acetazolamide. subsequently,
another group, studying retrobulbar blood ﬂow of
healthy volunteers, showed that acetazolamide

article in press
v.p. costa et al. / progress in retinal and eye research 22 (2003) 769–805

improved oa blood ﬂow velocity by as much as 19%
(p ¼ 0:003), when measured by cdi (kiss et al., 1999).
it is unclear why these reports showed contradictory
ﬁndings. however, it is signiﬁcant to note that
kerty et al. (1994) administered acetazolamide intravenously, while in the latter studies, the drug was given
orally.
in 1998, dallinger et al. were the ﬁrst to show that
choroidal blood ﬂow was increased in healthy humans
by iv acetazolamide. measured by laser interferometric
techniques, acetazolamide increased fundus pulsation
amplitude in a dose-dependent manner. this was
supported by additional evidence, which showed an
increase in blood ﬂow as measured by pobf (kiss et al.,
1999). however, grunwald and zinn (1992) were not
able to detect a statistically signiﬁcant change induced
by 500 mg acetazolamide in the macular blood ﬂow of
20 healthy subjects as measured by the blue-ﬁeld
simulation technique.
the latest evidence regarding systemic acetazolamide
and obf is limited, but in general, supports the drug’s
ability to increase obf. acetazolamide has been shown
with the most recent technology to increase choroidal
and retinal blood ﬂow (rassam et al., 1993; dallinger
et al., 1998; kiss et al., 1999). retrobulbar ﬁndings are
somewhat controversial, showing decreased, increased
or no change in oa blood ﬂow. however, it is
important to remember differences in inclusion and
exclusion criteria and variations of drug administration
(iv versus oral), as well as dosing when evaluating or
comparing studies.
5.5.2.  xxxd1931xxx 
 xxxd1931xxx  2% was developed for
maximum corneal and scleral penetration to reach the
target of ca inhibition and reduce aqueous humor
formation (wang et al., 1991; sugrue et al., 1997;
sugrue, 2000).  xxxd1931xxx  has been shown to be a
water-soluble potent inhibitor of human  xxxg293xxx  and  xxxg295xxx  inside the ciliary processes of the eye (sugrue et al.,
1997; maren et al., 1997).  xxxd1931xxx  has an ic50
value of 0.18 nm in vitro, while its inhibitory activity
against human ca isoenzyme i is much weaker (ic50
value of 600 nm) (kobayashi and naito, 2000). accumulation of the drug in red blood cells is detectable for 8
days, then remains unchanged through the normal
course of treatment for up to a 4 month half-life, and
binds moderately to plasma proteins (sugrue et al.,
1997; kobayashi and naito, 2000).
it is important to note that the low ph of  xxxd1931xxx 
(dobbs et al., 1979; volstrup, 1988), while possibly
causing discomfort at instillation, may have a role in
lowering local ph and thereby increasing obf. it has
been reported that  xxxd1931xxx  lowers the ph of
aqueous humour more than any other tested glaucoma
medication ( xxxd2446xxx , pilocarpine, and  xxxd3377xxx ),

789

requiring 240 min before aqueous humour levels reach
baseline ph values (veselovsky et al., 2001).
5.5.2.1. experimental studies. in 1999, tamaki et al.
investigated the effect of 1% topical  xxxd1931xxx  on
tissue circulation in the onh of dutch rabbits with the
laser speckle tissue circulation analyzer. one eye of each
rabbit received 1% topical  xxxd1931xxx  twice daily for
20 days, and the fellow eye received the vehicle in a
masked, randomized manner. at the end of the followup period, the authors found no signiﬁcant change in
onh blood ﬂow either in  xxxd1931xxx -treated or
vehicle-treated eyes.
5.5.2.2. studies in healthy individuals and ocular hypertensive patients. in a double-masked, randomized,
crossover study, 11 healthy volunteers received either
placebo or two drops of 2%  xxxd1931xxx  2 h prior to
cdi examination (harris et al., 1996a, b). scanning
laser ophthalmoscopy was used to examine retinal and
superﬁcial onh blood linear velocity.  xxxd1931xxx  was
not shown to signiﬁcantly affect retrobulbar hemodynamic parameters. however,  xxxd1931xxx  did enhance
retinal blood ﬂow velocity indices and, when associated
with unchanged retinal arterial and venous diameters,
was shown to improve retinal blood ﬂow and to
increase capillary velocity in the superﬁcial vessels of
the onh.
subsequently, investigators used pobf technology to
show a statistically signiﬁcant increase in ocular pulse
amplitude (opa) after  xxxd1931xxx  treatment in a series
of randomized, prospective, masked clinical trials
including healthy individuals and glaucoma patients
(schmidt et al., 1997, 1998). since pobf is an indirect
measurement of generalized obf volume, it is assumed
that opa is largely inﬂuenced by choroidal hemodynamics (85% of obf volume). although pobf
technology is an indirect measurement and its reproducibility is highly debated (vogel et al., 2001), this was the
ﬁrst study to suggest that  xxxd1931xxx  directly affected
choroidal blood ﬂow
in 1999, pillunat et al. (1999) studied the effects of
topical  xxxd1931xxx  on the onh blood ﬂow of healthy
subjects in a double-masked, randomized clinical trial.
 xxxd1931xxx  was applied to both eyes of 15 healthy
subjects tid for 3 days, while placebo was given to 15
healthy volunteers under the same protocol. laser
doppler ﬂowmetry and scanning laser doppler ﬂowmetry were unable to detect any signiﬁcant change in
onh blood ﬂow during either  xxxd1931xxx  or placebo
therapy.
the effects of  xxxd1931xxx  on the retinal circulation
of 20 healthy subjects were investigated in 1997, using a
double-masked randomized study design (grunwald
et al., 1997). main temporal retinal vein blood ﬂow
parameters were measured with bi-directional ldv

article in press
790

v.p. costa et al. / progress in retinal and eye research 22 (2003) 769–805

and monochromatic fundus photography 2 h after
administration of 1 drop of 2%  xxxd1931xxx  in one
eye and placebo in the other eye. although  xxxd1931xxx 
was found to change vessel diameter, maximum
erythrocyte velocity, and volumetric blood ﬂow rate,
none of these changes proved to be statistically
signiﬁcant when comparison to baseline.
5.5.2.3. studies in glaucoma patients. harris et al. studied the obf effects of  xxxd1931xxx  on glaucoma
patients in 1999 (harris et al., 1999b). eighteen patients
with  xxxd2741xxx , after medication washout, were treated
for 4 weeks with 2% topical  xxxd1931xxx  tid,
while a control group of 11  xxxd2741xxx  patients received
placebo treatment. measurements were taken at
baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. retinal
avp time and retinal arterial/venous diameters
were measured with slo, while blood ﬂow velocities
in the oa, cra, and spcas were measured with
cdi. when compared to baseline measurements,
 xxxd1931xxx  was found to signiﬁcantly accelerate
retinal avp time at 2 and 4-week post-drug measurements, while leaving the major retinal arterial and
venous diameters unchanged. additionally, in agreement with previous results (harris et al., 1996a, b),
blood ﬂow velocity measurements in the retrobulbar
vessels were not signiﬁcantly altered by  xxxd1931xxx 
treatment.
martinez et al. (1999) also measured  xxxd1931xxx ’s
effect on the oa, cra and central retinal vein (crv),
using cdi. twenty-six eyes of 26 patients with
documented poag and 13 normal eyes of 8 agematched controls were studied. study populations were
further divided into patients with initial and advanced
poag (based on visual ﬁeld defects) and healthy
volunteers. measurements were taken at baseline and
2 h after administration of 2 drops of  xxxd1931xxx  2%.
in the oa,  xxxd1931xxx  was found to signiﬁcantly
improve the edv and resistance index without changing
the psv, in both healthy and glaucomatous eyes. in the
cra,  xxxd1931xxx  signiﬁcantly increased the psv in
glaucoma patients but did not affect the same measurement in healthy controls. the effect of the drug by
improving the edv and the resistance index in the cra
was similar in both glaucomatous patients and healthy
controls.
harris et al. (2000) compared the effects on obf of
 xxxd1931xxx  and betaxolol. because betaxolol and
 xxxd1931xxx  have similar iop-lowering effects, changes
in obf would be independent from iop. nine patients
with  xxxd2741xxx  were randomly assigned to either 1 drop of
2%  xxxd1931xxx  tid or 0.5% betaxolol bid (openlabel) in the right eye, after a 3-week washout of all eye
medications. using cdi and slo technologies,  xxxd1931xxx  was found to have no effect on ﬂow velocities in
either the cra or oa, but signiﬁcantly accelerated

inferotemporal retinal avp time, whereas betaxolol did
not affect any of the retrobulbar vessels or retinal avp
time.
in a retrospective, open clinical trial,  xxxd1931xxx  eye
drops were administered to 28 poag patients in both
eyes, 3 times daily for a mean follow up of 9 months. in
 xxxd1931xxx -treated patients, the iop dropped from 18
to 15.5 mmhg after 9 months therapy (po0:01) and a
statistically signiﬁcant increase was found for pobf
measurements from 543 to 675 ml/min (po0:05) (bernd
et al., 2001).
in 2001, avunduk et al. compared the effects of 0.5%
betaxolol bid, 2%  xxxd1931xxx  tid, and 1%  xxxd201xxx  tid on obf. in a double-masked, prospective,
randomized trial, 22 patients with newly diagnosed
poag who had never previously used eye medications
were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment
groups, and cdi measurements were taken at baseline
and after 15 and 30 days of treatment. in the
 xxxd1931xxx  group, the resistance index in the spca
was signiﬁcantly lower on days 15 and 30, compared to
pretreatment measurements. in addition, resistance
index values on day 30 were signiﬁcantly lower than
those of day 15.  xxxd1931xxx  did not have any
statistically signiﬁcant effect on either the oa or
cra. in comparison to the  xxxd201xxx  or betaxolol
groups, peak systolic velocities in the oa were
signiﬁcantly higher in patients receiving  xxxd1931xxx 
treatment; a similar comparison between betaxolol and
 xxxd201xxx  did not show any statistically signiﬁcant
difference.
galassi et al. (2002) investigated the effect of
 xxxd1931xxx  and  xxxd3377xxx  on retrobulbar hemodynamics
using cdi. twenty poag patients (20 eyes) randomly
selected who had not received previous glaucoma
treatment were studied at baseline and after 4 weeks of
either 0.5%  xxxd3377xxx  bid or 2%  xxxd1931xxx  tid.
measurements were taken 20 h after the last dose was
given. statistical analysis suggested that  xxxd3377xxx  did
not induce signiﬁcant changes in retrobulbar hemodynamics in this study. in the same patients,  xxxd1931xxx 
treatment did not modify blood ﬂow parameters
in the oa and cra; however, temporal spcas
showed a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in the ri
(po0:05).
in a double-masked, randomized, prospective trial, no
correlation between  xxxd1931xxx  and obf was found in
a group of 47 previously untreated poag patients
(bergstrand et al., 2002). using cdi and ﬂuorescein
slo, none of the ﬂow parameters, retrobulbar or
retinal, changed signiﬁcantly with  xxxd1931xxx  therapy.
multi-variable statistical analysis and non-simultaneous
tests failed to reveal any statistically signiﬁcant changes
in the cra, oa, spcas or retinal blood ﬂow
parameters (avp time, mean dye velocity or macular
capillary velocity).

5.5.3.  xxxd367xxx 
 xxxd367xxx  1% is another topical cai administered
to patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle
glaucoma. following topical ocular administration,
 xxxd367xxx  is absorbed into the systemic circulation.
due to its afﬁnity for  xxxg293xxx ,  xxxd367xxx  distributes
extensively into the red blood cells and exhibits a long
half-life in whole blood (approximately 111 days). in
humans, the metabolite n-desethyl  xxxd367xxx  is
formed, which also binds to ca and accumulates in
red blood cells.

erythrocytes, with slow release (half-life=4 months).
absorbed  xxxd1931xxx  and  xxxd3377xxx  undergo hepatic
metabolism; both agents are excreted renally.

5.5.3.1. experimental studies. barnes et al. compared
the effects of  xxxd367xxx  2%,  xxxd1931xxx  2%, and
placebo on microvascular onh blood ﬂow in dutch
rabbits (barnes et al., 2000). using a three-way crossover study design, microvascular onh blood ﬂow was
measured by ldf before treatment and after drug-free
washout periods of 7–14 days. one drop of  xxxd367xxx ,  xxxd1931xxx , or placebo was administered twice
daily (9 am and 5 pm) in the right eye only, for 7 days.
experimental measurements were made 90 min after the
9 am topical dose was administered on day 8. onh
blood ﬂow was signiﬁcantly increased in topical-caitreated rabbits, as compared to placebo-treated controls. the changes in onh blood ﬂow and iop were not
signiﬁcantly different between the cai groups ( xxxd367xxx  vs.  xxxd1931xxx ). based on these results, it was
concluded that topical ocular cai treatment for 1 week
with either  xxxd367xxx  or  xxxd1931xxx  signiﬁcantly
reduced iop and signiﬁcantly increased onh blood
ﬂow in tranquilized dutch-belted rabbits.

5.5.4.2. studies in glaucoma patients. in 1999, 14 oag
patients were run in for 4 weeks on  xxxd3377xxx  and then
treated for 4 weeks with  xxxd3377xxx  and  xxxd1931xxx 
combination. the ﬁxed combination was shown to
signiﬁcantly increase the ocular pulse amplitude as
measured with pobf. since pobf is assumed to be
mostly a measure of chorodial blood ﬂow, the results
suggest a positive effect on increasing choroidal circulation during this treatment (schmidt et al., 1999).
harris et al. (2001a) investigated 15 patients with
poag, after 1 month on  xxxd3377xxx  or dorzolamidetimolol treatment. patients were ﬁrst placed on a
medication-dependent 1-week to 4-week washout, then
baseline measurements were taken. the ﬁxed combination signiﬁcantly reduced iop and decreased avp time
in the superior temporal artery (2.13 to 1.76 s, p ¼ 0:01),
while having no statistically signiﬁcant effects on visual
function. thus,  xxxd3377xxx  in combination with  xxxd1931xxx  did not alter the latter’s drug effect on increasing
retinal blood ﬂow. conversely, the ﬁxed combination
was not shown to alter obf in the retrobulbar
vasculature or choroidal blood ﬂow, as measured by
cdi and slo icg angiography, respectively.

5.5.3.2. studies in glaucoma patients. in 2001, sampaolesi et al. studied the obf effects of betaxolol,
 xxxd367xxx  and brimonidine on 72 glaucomatous
onhs and retinal vasculatures in humans. patients
were examined with scanning laser doppler ﬂowmetry
(638 nm wavelength), and ﬂow, volume, and velocity
indices were assessed in each report. perfusion maps
were analyzed with the new scanning laser doppler
ﬂowmeter software, version 3.2 (automatic full ﬁeld
perfusion image analyzer). none of the drugs was shown
to produce a statistically signiﬁcant effect on onh
capillary blood ﬂow.
5.5.4.  xxxd3377xxx  and  xxxd1931xxx  fixed combination
 xxxd1931xxx  and  xxxd3377xxx  were
combined in one ophthalmic solution for the treatment
of patients with ocular hypertension ( xxxd3285xxx ) or openangle glaucoma (oag). the drug consists of two
components that decrease aqueous production.
both  xxxd1931xxx  and  xxxd3377xxx  are systemically
absorbed following topical application, although plasma
levels of either agent are not always detectable.
signiﬁcant accumulation of  xxxd1931xxx  occurs in

5.5.4.1. experimental studies. in 2002, sherbini et al.
(2002) compared the vasoactive effects of  xxxd2446xxx 
and the ﬁxed combination of  xxxd3377xxx  and  xxxd1931xxx  in
isolated quiescent porcine ciliary arteries. diluted
preparations of  xxxd2446xxx  induced a statistically
signiﬁcant, however small (3.271.0%) contraction in
comparison to the ﬁxed combination (0.670.2%).

6. the effects of systemic medications on ocular blood
ﬂow
the effects of systemic medications with vasoactive
properties on obf have also been evaluated, especially
with regard to calcium channel blockers. there are other
substances that could theoretically improve obf and
have also been included in the list of potentially useful
drugs in the treatment of glaucoma.
6.1. calcium channel blockers
calcium, which may inﬂuence a variety of cellular
functions, enters excitable cells through voltage-gated
calcium channels. there are six classes of calcium
channels: l, t, n, p, q, and r. among them, the
l-type is the predominant calcium channel in skeletal,
cardiac, and vascular smooth muscle (piepho, 1983;
varadi et al., 1995; kanellopoulos et al., 1996).

article in press
792

v.p. costa et al. / progress in retinal and eye research 22 (2003) 769–805

drugs that decrease intracellular calcium levels by
inhibiting calcium entry into the cells are called calcium
channel blockers (ccbs). these agents lead to smooth
muscle cell relaxation and cerebral, coronary, and
peripheral vasodilation (braunwald, 1982; bussey and
talbert, 1984). in 1985, the world health organization
classiﬁed ccbs in 6 groups according to their clinical
and pharmacological properties (vanhoutte and
paoletti, 1987). type i are verapamil-like drugs, type
ii are nifedipine-like drugs, type iii are diltiazem-like
drugs, type iv are ﬂunarizine-like drugs, type v are
 xxxd3007xxx -like drugs, and type vi are all other ccbs
(e.g.,  xxxd2884xxx , caroverine). ccbs types i, ii, and iii
are used in the treatment of several conditions, including
essential hypertension, vasospastic and chronic stable
angina pectoris, raynaud syndrome, migraine, asthma,
and supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (braunwald,
1982; bussey and talbert, 1984).
due to their vasodilatory properties, the potential role
of ccbs in the management of glaucoma has been
investigated. several studies, most of them retrospective,
have suggested that ccbs may be successful in
controlling visual ﬁeld progression in patients with
 xxxd2741xxx  (flammer and guthauser, 1987; kitazawa et al.,
1989; netland et al., 1993; gaspar et al., 1994; sawada
et al., 1996; daugeliene et al., 1999). others have
demonstrated that systemic and topical ccbs may
lower iop both experimentally and in humans (segarra
et al., 1993; netland et al., 1996; abelson et al., 1988;
siegner et al., 2000). however, as mentioned before, the
analysis of such studies are beyond the scope of this
review.
6.1.1. experimental studies
in 1995, meyer et al. investigated the effects of two
ccbs (lacidipine and nifedipine) on isolated porcine
ciliary arteries, and found that both reduced the
contractions and decreased the sensitivity to  xxxg674xxx . however, vasodilation mediated by bradykinin
and sodium nitroprusside were unaffected by these
drugs. experiments by nyborg et al. (1991) and lang
et al. (1997) also showed inhibitory effects of  xxxd2737xxx , amlodipine, and lomerizine on endothelin-1induced contractions in bovine retinal arteries and
porcine ciliary arteries, respectively. similarly,  xxxd2737xxx  and  xxxd600xxx , a verapamil analogue, have been found
to cause relaxation of prostaglandin-induced constriction of isolated calf retinal vessels (nielson and nyborg,
1989), whereas diltiazem and verapamil promoted
relaxation of cat ophthalmociliary artery ring segments
in vitro (yu et al., 1992).
low doses of intravenous  xxxd2718xxx  (20 mg/kg) have
been shown to have little effect on the cat retinal blood
ﬂow, whereas a high dose (100 mg/kg) produced a
statistically signiﬁcant transient decrease in retinal blood
ﬂow as measured by ldv. by contrast, both doses

resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in onh blood ﬂow
measured with laser doppler ﬂowmetry, which were
followed by a statistically signiﬁcant increase in the
vitreous po2 just in front of the onh (harino et al.,
1992). lomerizine,  xxxd2726xxx , and pranidipine were
found to inhibit the  xxxg674xxx -induced perturbations
of the onh circulation of rabbits measured with the
hydrogen clearance method and laser doppler ﬂowmetry, however, the last two drugs also resulted in
statistically signiﬁcant blood pressure reductions (toriu
et al., 2001). intravenous doses of 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg
 xxxd2718xxx  promoted an average dilation of rabbit
retinal vessels of 3% and 22%, respectively (kohzuka,
1984).
tomita et al. (1999a) studied the effects of  xxxd2726xxx 
(3.2 mg/kg iv) on the onh, choroid, and retina of
rabbits using the laser speckle and the hydrogen gas
clearance methods. the normalized blur measured in
these tissues increased by 10–25% in the  xxxd2726xxx 
group compared to the control group (po0:0001).
blood ﬂow rate in the onh determined by the hydrogen
gas clearance method also showed a 25% increase in the
 xxxd2726xxx  group (tomita et al., 1999a).
6.1.2. studies in healthy individuals and ocular
hypertensive patients
cdi was employed to evaluate the orbital hemodynamic effects of 10 mg nifedipine (sublingual) in 12
healthy volunteers. the authors observed statistically
signiﬁcant increases in the peak systolic velocities of the
oa and spca (gobel and lieb, 1995). topical
verapamil was found to promote a statistically signiﬁcant reduction of the ri of the cra in normal human
subjects undergoing cdi examination (netland et al.,
1995).
in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study,
schocket et al. (1999) employed laser doppler ﬂowmetry
and ldv to investigate the retinal, choroidal, and onh
blood ﬂow of 10 normal individuals who received oral
 xxxd2092xxx . despite statistically signiﬁcant decreases in
diastolic blood pressure and perfusion pressure, no
statistically signiﬁcant change in retinal, choroidal, or
onh blood ﬂow were observed following the administration of  xxxd2092xxx .
a randomized, double-blind study was performed by
strenn et al. (1998), who evaluated the effects of
nifedipine 5 mg on the ocular hemodynamics of 12
healthy subjects as assessed by laser interferometric
measurements of the fundus pulsation amplitude and
laser doppler ﬂowmetry of the onh. although no
statistically signiﬁcant changes were detected following
the administration of nifedipine in baseline conditions,
the drug was able to reverse the  xxxg674xxx -induced
(2 ng/kg/min) constriction in ocular vasculature.
the effects of topical verapamil on the onh blood
ﬂow of 12 healthy subjects were evaluated using the laser

article in press
v.p. costa et al. / progress in retinal and eye research 22 (2003) 769–805

doppler technique in a randomized, double-masked
study. the authors reported statistically signiﬁcant
increases in onh blood ﬂow in both verapamil 0.25%
and fellow placebo-treated eyes, and attributed this
ﬁnding to a possible crossover effect (netland et al.,
1996).
6.1.3. studies in glaucoma patients
several authors reported on the effects of ccbs on
the retrobulbar blood ﬂow of glaucoma patients, but all
studies were non-randomized and unmasked. harris
et al. (1997) investigated 21 patients with  xxxd2741xxx  before
and after 6 months treatment with nifedipine (30 mg/
day). among the 16 patients who ﬁnished the study
protocol, there was no statistically signiﬁcant change in
retrobulbar hemodynamics after treatment. in a posthoc analysis of a subgroup of patients who responded
with an increase in contrast sensitivity (n ¼ 8), statistically signiﬁcant increases of peak systolic and end
diastolic velocities in the oa were detected. wilson et al.
(1997) conﬁrmed that nifedipine (30 mg/day for 6 weeks)
was not associated with changes in retrobulbar blood
ﬂow of 18 patients with oag, but identiﬁed a
remarkable variability in patients’ response to nifedipine. similar negative results, had been previously,
reported by geyer et al. (1996), who employed cdi to
investigate 11 patients with  xxxd2741xxx  receiving nifedipine
30 mg/day for 3 weeks.
on the other hand, studies published by japanese
investigators (yamamoto et al., 1998; tomita et al.,
1999a, b; niwa et al., 2000) determined a positive effect
of  xxxd2726xxx  on obf. in all studies, statistically
signiﬁcant decreases in the ri of the cra and spcas
were measured following treatment with  xxxd2726xxx 
2 mg/day for 2–4 weeks in patients with  xxxd2741xxx . oral
administration of ﬂunarizine was also found to increase
peak systolic velocities and decrease the ri of the oa
and spca in 20 patients with  xxxd2741xxx  (cellini et al., 1997).
the only double-masked study investigating the effect of
a ccb in a glaucoma population was performed by
tomita et al. (1999a), who employed the laser speckle
technique to measure the onh blood ﬂow following
the administration of oral  xxxd2726xxx  (4 mg/day) for
12 weeks. the authors observed a statistically
signiﬁcant increase in the normalized blur in the
onh of  xxxd2726xxx -treated patients compared to the
placebo-treated patients throughout the follow-up
period.
schmidt et al. (1996) performed pobf measurements
in 32  xxxd2741xxx  patients, and described two different
patterns of response to nifedipine. according to this
study, only those patients with a vasospastic response
showed a statistically signiﬁcant increase in ocular pulse
amplitude after 3 months of nifedipine treatment.
rainer et al. (2001) measured the ocular fundus
pulsation amplitude of 30 patients with open angle

793

glaucoma who received nifedipine 30 mg/day for 3
months. among the 25 patients who tolerated the
medication, there was no statistically signiﬁcant change
in ocular fundus pulsation amplitude. in a doublemasked, placebo-controlled, crossover, short-term study,
piltz et al. (1998) failed to demonstrate any effect of
60 mg  xxxd2728xxx  on the macular blood ﬂow of 13
 xxxd2741xxx  patients as measured by the blue ﬁeld entoptic
simulator.
it is important to emphasize that the chronic use of
ccbs may be associated with intolerable side effects
(wilson et al., 1997; harris et al., 1997; rainer et al.,
2001). in one study (wilson et al., 1997), 2 out of 18
patients could not tolerate nifedipine 30 mg/day,
whereas in another report (harris et al., 1997), 3 out
of 21 patients experienced intolerable side effects,
and two additional patients showed a signiﬁcant
reduction in visual function and had to discontinue
the medication.
6.2. inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system
the circulating renin angiotensin system plays an
important role in the regulation of systemic blood
pressure, and may also modify organ-specifc blood ﬂow
(luscher and vanhoutte, 1990). renin is the enzyme
that transforms  xxxg99xxx  in  xxxg99xxx , which
is biologically inactive.  xxxg99xxx  mrna has
been detected in the choroid and retina of rats (murata
et al., 1997). in humans,  xxxg99xxx  has been
identiﬁed in the cytoplasm of the non-pigmented ciliary
epithelium, as well as in the blood vessels lumina of the
uvea and retina (sramek et al., 1992).  xxxg99xxx  is
activated into  xxxg99xxx  by the angiotensin converting enzyme (ace), whose activity has been demonstrated in the human, feline, and bovine retinal
vasculature (ferrari-dileo et al., 1988).  xxxg99xxx 
is a potent vasoconstrictor, and has been shown to cause
contractile effects in human, bovine, and porcine ciliary
arteries (nyborg and nielsen, 1990; meyer et al.,
1995a, b), possibly through the activation of at1
receptors (meyer et al., 1995a). furthermore, there are
speciﬁc binding sites to  xxxg99xxx  in onh vessels
(ferrari-dileo et al., 1991). ace also inactivates
bradykinin, a substance released from endothelial cells
that stimulates the formation of prostacyclin and nitric
oxide, two potent vasodilators (mombouli et al., 1992).
experimental studies in cats have demonstrated that the
vasoconstrictor properties of the renin angiotensin
system reduced the ability of the onh vasculature to
autoregulate when challenged by an iop increase (sossi
and anderson, 1983).
inhibition of the renin angiotensin system can be
accomplished with ace inhibitors, which have been
successfully employed in the treatment of patients with
hypertension and congestive heart failure (consensus

article in press
794

v.p. costa et al. / progress in retinal and eye research 22 (2003) 769–805

trial study group, 1987). several reports suggest that
ace inhibitors are ocular hypotensive agents in rabbits
and humans, an effect secondary to an increase in
outﬂow facility (constad et al., 1988; costagliola et al.,
1995; shah et al., 2000). meyer et al. (1995b) investigated the effect of ace inhibitors enalaprilat and
benazepril on isolated porcine ciliary arteries and on
perfused porcine eyes. the authors reported that neither
agent modiﬁed the vascular tone or ophthalmic ﬂow in
baseline conditions. however, both substances enhanced the relaxation of ciliary arteries to bradykinin,
and prevented the vasoconstrictive effects of angiotensin
i. steigerwalt et al. (1998) evaluated the effect of
 xxxd3409xxx , an oral ace inhibitor, on the retrobulbar
blood ﬂow of 12 non-glaucomatous patients with
systemic hypertension who received the drug for 1
week, and described a statistically signiﬁcant increase in
cra and spca blood ﬂow velocities.
another way to inhibit the renin angiotensin system is
by employing at1-receptor antagonists, such as  xxxd3487xxx  or losartan potassium. similarly to ace inhibitors,
losartan potassium has been found to have an ioplowering effect associated with an increase in outﬂow
facility (costagliola et al., 2000).  xxxd3487xxx  (109 to
105 m) blocked the vasocontricion induced by  xxxg99xxx  in isolated porcine ciliary arteries (meyer et al.,
1995a, b). in a placebo-controlled, randomized, doublemasked study, matulla et al. (1997) investigated the
effect of losartan 100 mg on the retrobulbar blood ﬂow
and pulsatile choroidal blood ﬂow of 10 healthy
subjects. although losartan signiﬁcantly increased pulsatile choroidal blood ﬂow, retrobulbar blood ﬂow was
not affected. however, the drug was successful in
preventing the hemodynamic changes induced by the
administration of  xxxg99xxx  to these individuals.
the authors suggested that  xxxg99xxx  is not a
major determinant of obf in vivo. similar ﬁndings
were reported by spicher et al. (2002), who were not
able to detect a signiﬁcant change in choroidal laser
doppler ﬂowmetry parameters following a single
oral 50 mg dose of losartan potassium to 12
healthy subjects.
6.3.  xxxd2199xxx 
the ginkgo tree, also known as the maiden-hair or
 xxxd2199xxx , is the last survivor of the ginkgoaceae family.
the ginkgo tree may be the longest living extant tree,
and its fossils have been dated back as far as 250 million
years (deng, 1988). the ginkgo tree, which is indigenous
to korea, china, and japan, may grow to 40 m in height
and may live for more than 1000 years.
 xxxd2199xxx  extract (gbe) is a concentrate
obtained from dried or fresh leaves in an acetone-water
solution. it contains over 60 known bioactive substances, including 24% ﬂavonoids, 6% terpenes, 7%

proanthocyanidines, and other uncharacterized compounds (de feudis, 1991). a typical daily dose is 120 mg
gbe in two or three oral doses. today, ginkgo is
probably the most widely used herbal treatment to
augment cognitive function, especially in europe
(ritch, 2000; gold et al., 2002). a recent review of the
literature suggested that ‘‘clear evidence for or against
the possibility that ginkgo enhances learning and
memory is not available at this time’’ (gold et al.,
2002). for this reason, the united states national
institute on aging is currently supporting a clinical trial
to investigate the efﬁcacy of ginkgo in treating
alzheimer’s disease.
the use of gbe in the treatment of glaucoma has
been suggested due to several potential biological
actions, including reduction of serum viscosity, antioxidant activity,  xxxd2973xxx  inhibitory
activity, inhibition of apoptosis, and inhibition of
excitotoxicity (ritch, 2000; rhee et al., 2001). furthermore, gbe has been found to improve both peripheral
and cerebral blood ﬂow, an effect which has been
attributed to the non-ﬂavone fraction (chang and
chang, 1997).
however, there is very little information on the
inﬂuence of gbe therapy on obf. in fact, the only
available study was published by chung et al. (1999a, b)
who performed a crossover trial, in 11 healthy
volunteers. the individuals were treated with 120 mg
gbe or placebo for 2 days, with a 2-week washout
period between treatments. gbe signiﬁcantly increased
edv in the oa, with no change seen in the placebotreated arm. there were no experimental studies or
studies in glaucoma patients investigating the effects of
gbe on obf.
6.4. magnesium
although magnesium is the least abundant serum
electrolyte, it inﬂuences the metabolism of ca, k, p, zn,
fe, na, acetylcholine, and  xxxd2738xxx , modulates the
action of several enzymes, and helps promoting intracellular homeostasis and the activation of thiamine
(johnson, 2001).
magnesium, known as ‘‘nature’s physiological calcium blocker’’ (iseri and french, 1984), has been shown
to lower baseline vascular tension, and decrease reaction
to vasoconstrictors (altura and altura, 1981; farago
et al., 1991; torregrosa et al., 1994; kumasaka et al.,
1996). these effects have been attributed to a calciumantagonist like mechanism (kumasaka et al., 1996),
possibly through the inhibition of calcium inﬂux across
the vascular smooth muscle cell membranes. magnesium
has been prescribed for a variety of conditions, including
vascular disorders (mroczeck et al., 1977), arrhythmias
due to acute myocardial infarction (schechter, 1991),
and migraine (mauskop et al., 1995).

article in press
v.p. costa et al. / progress in retinal and eye research 22 (2003) 769–805

very little is known about the effects of magnesium
on obf. in an experiment employing isolated porcine
ciliary arteries, high concentrations of extracellular
magnesium were found to evoke dose-dependent relaxations of  xxxg674xxx  precontracted vessels, possibly
through a calcium-antagonist effect (dettmann et al.,
1998). the range of normal plasmatic concentrations of
magnesium varies between 0.7 and 1.1 mmol/l. at
physiological magnesium concentrations (1.0 mmol/l),
the authors observed a 50% relaxation in precontracted
vessels, but the complete inhibition of endothelin-1induced contractions were obtained with very high
concentrations (10.0 mmol/l), sufﬁcient to provoke
cardiac arrest.
the only study investigating the use of magnesium in
humans was performed by gaspar et al. (1995), who
reported a statistically signiﬁcant improvement in
peripheral blood ﬂow (measured with video-nailfoldcapillaroscopy), as well as a tendency to improve visual
ﬁeld scores in 10 glaucoma patients receiving 121.5 mg
bid for 1 month. there are no prospective, placebocontrolled studies evaluating the effect of magnesium on
the obf of glaucoma patients.
6.5.  xxxd1914xxx 
 xxxd1914xxx  is a pyrimidopyrimidine derivative
that prevents the development of platelet clots by
inhibiting the uptake of adenosine into the cells,
and by inhibiting  xxxd1773xxx  phosphodiesterase
(klabunde, 1983; fitzgerald, 1987).  xxxd1914xxx  is
known to produce vasodilation of coronary and
pulmonary arteries (alonso and o’brian, 1967; winburry et al., 1971), and to reduce endothelin-provoked
vasoconstriction. its vasodilatory effect is dependent on
the endothelial cell layer, and is blocked by the presence
of l-name (nitro-l-arginine methyl ester) and  xxxd2352xxx  (meyer et al., 1995a, b).
in 1988, braunagel et al. employed radio labeled
microspheres and laser doppler to measure the obf
following intravitreal injection of two adenosine uptake
inhibitors: papaverine and  xxxd1914xxx . the authors
were able to observe a statistically signiﬁcant increase in
blood ﬂow in all ocular tissues, including iris, ciliary
body, retina, and choroid. the effect of  xxxd1914xxx  on
isolated porcine ciliary arteries, was investigated by
meyer et al. (1995) who reported a vasodilatory effect,
probably mediated by endothelial  xxxd2738xxx  and
prostacyclin. kaiser et al. (1996) employed cdi to
measure the retrobulbar blood ﬂow velocities in a
prospective open trial including a heterogeneous group
of 23 patients with aion, vasospastic syndrome,
glaucoma, or central retinal vein occlusion, and
observed a statistically signiﬁcant increase in mean
systolic and diastolic blood velocities in the oa, cra,
and spcas.

7. perspectives and conclusions
the results of this review suggest that there are very
few well-designed studies investigating the long-term
effects of antiglaucoma or systemic medications on the
obf of glaucomatous patients. among the 136 articles
dealing with the effect of antiglaucoma drugs on obf,
only 36 (26.5%) investigated the effects of medications
on glaucomatous patients. among these 36 articles, only
3 (8.3%) were long-term studies (duration of at least 3
months), and only 16 (44.4%) were double-masked,
randomized, prospective trials. among the 33 articles
describing the effects of systemic medications on obf,
only 11 (33.3%) investigated glaucoma patients, of
which only one (9.1%) was a double-masked, randomized, prospective trial.
based on this preliminary data, we suggest that few
antiglaucoma medications have the potential to directly
improve obf. unoprostone appears to have a reproducible anti-et-1 effect, betaxolol may exert a ca2+channel blocker activity,  xxxd201xxx  consistently
leads to anterior segment vasoconstriction, and cais
seem to accelerate the retinal circulation. regarding the
systemic drugs, ccbs apparently do not evoke a
uniform response in glaucoma patients. some show an
improvement of obf, whereas others either do not
show a change or develop deteriorations of hemodynamic parameters and visual function. until it is
possible to reliably discriminate between those patients
who would beneﬁt from the long-term treatment with
ccbs and those who might be harmed by the side effects
of the medication, it seems reasonable to use them with
caution. the use of other vasoactive substances in the
treatment of glaucoma is not supported by the evidence
we have.
before we conclude that modulating obf is beneﬁcial
for glaucoma patients, it is important to recognize that
several steps need to be taken. initially, the technologies
employed to analyze obf need to overcome some
limitations, allowing a more reproducible and reliable
way of measuring blood ﬂow in vivo. secondly, we need
to design experimental studies to assess the real
participation of blood ﬂow changes in the development
of glaucoma. finally, we still do not have longitudinal,
prospective, randomized trials demonstrating that the
use of vasoactive substances with no effect on iop is
capable of improving the control of glaucoma. these
studies need to be done, but to test the efﬁcacy of a given
substance in a population with a chronic, slowly
progressive disease, may require at least 3–5 years
before the results become available. however, we need
the results of such studies in order to base our clinical
decisions on scientiﬁcally proven information and not
on indirect evidence. on the other hand, we have
extensive literature suggesting the participation of blood
ﬂow in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. excluding the

possibility of modulating blood ﬂow as a way to treat
glaucoma is as inadequate as claiming it to be an
undisputed truth.
in summary, we believe that reducing the iop is not
the only way to treat glaucoma. in the future, we will
probably be able to treat glaucoma not only by reducing
iop, but also employing other strategies that will be
additive or synergistic to iop control. coming back to
the deﬁnition of glaucoma, it is easy to realize that it
includes the outcomes of the disease, with no mechanistic information. what we today call poag is possibly
constituted by a myriad of diseases, each one with a
singular genetic background and a unique pathogenesis.
improving our knowledge about the pathogenesis of
these diseases is essential to further the development of
new treatment modalities, which may include obf
modulation, neuroprotection, neuroregeneration, gene
therapy, or others.
