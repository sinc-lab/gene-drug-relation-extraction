use of aromatase inhibitors to increase final height

abstract
during puberty in both sexes, the mechanism involved in epiphyseal fusion is mediated by the action of estrogen through a cascade of events
including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of chondrocytes. the enzyme p450 aromatase catalyzes the aromatization of c19 androgens
(androstenedione and testosterone) to c18 estrogens (estrone and estradiol). inhibition of estrogen action by aromatase inhibitors (ais) appears
to decelerate the process of growth plate fusion, and thus ais may be used therapeutically to increase adult height. the clinical experience with
ais in the pediatric setting is limited to  xxxd3324xxx ,  xxxd2080xxx , letrozole, and anastrozole.  xxxd3324xxx , a nonselective steroidal ai, has been used
successfully as an adjunct to antiandrogen and  xxxg930xxx  analogue (gnrha), therapy for children with familial male-limited
precocious puberty (fmpp) and congenital adrenal hyperplasia (cah), and with some success in girls with mccune–albright syndrome. the
limitations of  xxxd3324xxx  include its relatively low potency and the need for frequent dosing. results of a randomized placebo-controlled trial
in boys with delayed puberty treated with letrozole, a selective nonsteroidal ai, found that boys treated with letrozole + testosterone experienced
delayed bone maturation and good growth response and achieved an increase in predicted adult height. in this study, only minor differences in bone
density were seen between the placebo and letrozole treatment groups, both of which were receiving concomitant testosterone therapy. no adverse
effects on testis size or inhibin b concentration were noted. the therapeutic value of ais in growth promotion now remains to be substantiated in
future controlled clinical trials.

1. estrogen and growth
in 1994, the case report of a man with inactivating mutation of
the  xxxg730xxx  (er) revolutionized the traditional concept
of the roles of sex steroids in males (smith et al., 1994). this 28year-old man was 204 cm tall, yet he had a bone age of 15 years
with open epiphyses of long bones, and consequently he was still
growing. moreover, he had no recollection of accelerated pubertal growth despite otherwise normal pubertal development. soon
thereafter, two males with similar phenotypes were described
(morishima et al., 1995; carani et al., 1997). in these men, the
effects of estrogens were suppressed due to mutations in the gene
coding for p450 aromatase enzyme, which converts androgens
to estrogens. administration of estrogen led to closure of the epiphyses and discontinued growth (carani et al., 1997; bilezikian
et al., 1998). in all of these men, concentrations of androgens
were normal or above normal. these case reports confirmed that
estrogens are essential hormones for epiphyseal closure in males.
moreover, the reports suggest that estrogens probably do not par-

ticipate in the regulation of linear growth, but they induce growth
acceleration during puberty. this newly discovered specific role
of estrogen in growth regulation has significantly increased scientific interest in the use of specific ais in treatment of patients
with short stature.
in premenopausal women, the source of estrogens is predominantly ovarian in origin. after menopause, estrogens are
mainly synthesized in peripheral tissues (e.g., adipose tissue,
skin, muscle, breast tissue, and bone) through local aromatization of circulating androgens, which are mostly produced by the
adrenals, to estrogens (labrie et al., 1997). p450 aromatase is
the enzyme that catalyzes the aromatization of c19 androgens
(androstenedione and testosterone) into c18 estrogens (estrone
and estradiol) (fig. 1). in males, it has been estimated that, at
best, the aromatase from testes accounts for about 15% of circulating estrogens; hence, extragonadal production of estrogens
is as physiologically important to men as to postmenopausal
women (labrie et al., 1997). the same is probably also true
for prepubertal children. therefore, the circulating levels of
testosterone produced by the testes in males must be efficiently
converted by the p450 aromatase at extragonadal sites to give
rise to local concentrations of estradiol sufficient to locally transactivate the er in estrogen-dependent tissues.

estrogen biosynthesis at these extragonadal sites possesses
certain fundamental features that differ from ovarian estogen
biosynthesis. for instance, extragonadal estrogen biosynthesis is
dependent on circulating precursor c19 steroids, and the estrogen
synthesized within these compartments, particularly in the bone,
breast, and brain, is probably biologically active only at the level
of local tissue in a “paracrine” or “intracrine” fashion (fig. 1)
(labrie et al., 1997; grumbach and auchus, 1999).

eral countries some of these third-generation ais have been
approved for clinical use in hormone-dependent breast cancer. the chemical structures of four competitive nonsteroidal
ais ( xxxd147xxx , anastrozole,  xxxd2080xxx , and letrozole)
and two steroidal ais ( xxxd2153xxx  and exemestane) are shown
in fig. 2.

2. ais

estrogen appears to be important for normal bone growth and
mineralization not only of human females, but also of human
males (oz et al., 2000; sasano et al., 1997). analyses conducted
using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridation techniques
suggest that aromatase is widely expressed in bone tissue of men
and women, supporting previous findings that bone in both men
and women has the capacity to convert androgen to estrogen
in the bone (sasano et al., 1997). these data, together with data
obtained from the clinical cases of inactivating mutations in er␣
and p450 aromatase genes (smith et al., 1994; morishima et al.,
1995; carani et al., 1997), provide the rationale for using ais to
promote longitudinal growth. to date, four ai compounds have
been used in children to promote growth:  xxxd3324xxx  (laue et
al., 1989, 1993; leschek et al., 1999; merke et al., 2000; feuillan
et al., 1986, 1993), anastrozole (mauras et al., 2000; roth et al.,
2002; kunz et al., 2003),  xxxd2080xxx  (nunez et al., 2003), and
letrozole (wickman et al., 2001, 2002; wickman and dunkel,
2001; feuillan et al., 2003) (table 1). the same doses of ais
prescribed to adults have been used in children, likely because
the adverse effects reported in older patients are generally mild
to moderate.

several pharmaceutical compounds have been developed to
inhibit activity of p450 aromatase (santen, 2003). in the 1960s,
clinical trials with the first-generation ai,  xxxd147xxx ,
provided practical proof that ais could be used for treatment of
hormone-dependent breast cancer (santen et al., 1990). however,  xxxd147xxx  had substantial side effects, which
diminished its usefulness. over the last 30 years, several more
potent and selective but less toxic ais have been developed
(sainsbury, 2004; miller, 2004). these new inhibitors can be
divided into two categories with respect to their mechanisms
of action: (1) steroidal inactivators, which bind covalently
to the active site of the enzyme and irreversibly destroy its
enzymatic action. these compounds are also called suicide or
mechanism-based inactivators and (2) nonsteroidal competitive
inhibitors, which bind to the active site of the aromatase enzyme
and block estrogen formation. the current, third-generation
compounds are nearly completely selective for the p450 aromatase enzyme, are between 1000- and 10,000-fold more potent
than  xxxd147xxx , and are much better tolerated. in sev-

3.1. mccune–albright syndrome
clinically, mccune–albright syndrome is characterized by
café au lait spots, fibrous dysplasia of bones, and sexual precocity. girls with precocious puberty due to mccune–albright syndrome have episodic increases in serum estrogen levels together
with formation of large ovarian cysts. serum gonadotropin levels are typically suppressed, and precocious puberty does not
respond to treatment with long-acting analogues of luteinizing
hormone-releasing hormone ( xxxg930xxx ). in 1 study, 12 girls with
precocious puberty due to mccune–albright syndrome were
treated with  xxxd3324xxx  (40 mg/kg/day) for periods of 0.5–5
years (feuillan et al., 1986, 1993, 1999). in the seven girls
who received  xxxd3324xxx  for at least 3 years, the mean (±s.d.)
serum estradiol level was 618 ± 268 pmol/l at the start of ther-

apy and fell to 156 ± 84 pmol/l at 1 year, 116 ± 48 pmol/l
after 2 years, and 241 ± 260 pmol/l after 3 years (p < 0.05
compared with start of therapy). two patients had recurrent
ovarian cysts after 3 years. these seven girls averaged eight
menses per year before therapy. the average frequency of
menses decreased to two episodes per year during the first
year of treatment, three per year during the second year,
and four per year during the third year. the mean testosterone levels were slightly above the normal prepubertal range
(0.51 ± 0.2 nmol/l) before treatment and did not change significantly during treatment. the mean androstenedione levels rose
from 1.1 ± 0.6 nmol/l before treatment to 2.1 ± 0.1 nmol/l at 2
years and 2.8 ± 0.1 nmol/l after 3 years of treatment (p < 0.05
compared with before treatment) and were consistent with normal adrenarche.

a based on a review of the literature, clinical experience with aromatase inhibitors in the pediatric setting is limited to four compounds:  xxxd3324xxx , anastrozole,
 xxxd2080xxx  and letrozole.

in this group of patients, the mean predicted adult stature
was 143.0 ± 7.8 cm before treatment and 147.3 ± 11.5 cm after
3 years (p = ns). in 3 of 12 girls, all with bone age greater than 12
years, the gonadotropin responses to gnrh indicated early central precocious puberty after 1–4 years of treatment. the adverse
effects of  xxxd3324xxx  were transient abdominal pain, headache,
and diarrhea in three girls and elevated hepatic enzymes in one
girl who had abnormal liver function before treatment. overall,
 xxxd3324xxx  was somewhat effective in the treatment of gnrhindependent precocious puberty in girls with mccune–albright
syndrome, but some patients exhibited an escape from the effects
of treatment after 1–3 years.
in a more recent study,  xxxd2080xxx  was given to 16 girls
with gnrh-independent precocious puberty due to mccune–
albright syndrome (nunez et al., 2003). the girls ranged in age
from 3.2 to 9.7 years, and their bone age ranged from 5.75 to
14.25 years. after baseline evaluations,  xxxd2080xxx  was started
at a dose of 240 ␮g/kg/day for 12–21 months. the dose was
increased to 480 ␮g/kg/day for an additional 12 months in 10
girls. during treatment, seven girls had evidence of central precocious puberty; hence, the gnrh agonist deslorelin was added
to their regimen. one girl was on therapy with a long-acting
gnrh agonist from the start of treatment. patients were evaluated at 2- to 6-month intervals throughout treatment. after the
first 6–12 months of treatment, 10 girls had some clinical benefits from  xxxd2080xxx  therapy, including decreased frequency of
menses and decreased rates of linear growth and bone maturation; however,  xxxd2080xxx  had no significant benefit in the group
as a whole. the seven girls with evidence of central precocious puberty had no slowing in the progression of their puberty

during the combined  xxxd2080xxx  and gnrh analogue treatment.
adverse effects of  xxxd2080xxx  included inhibition of cortisol and
aldosterone biosynthesis at the dose of 480 ␮g/kg/day, without clinical evidence of adrenal insufficiency. in addition, three
patients complained of nonspecific abdominal pain during  xxxd2080xxx  treatment.
3.2. fmpp
males affected with fmpp usually begin pubertal development by 1–3 years of age, which leads to rapid growth and
bone maturation, progressive virilization, and, ultimately, premature epiphyseal fusion and short adult stature. fmpp, also
termed testotoxicosis, is a gnrh-independent form of precocious puberty resulting from an activating mutation of the lh
receptor. the mutation occurs either in a de novo manner or is
inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.
in one trial, patients with fmpp were treated with  xxxd3324xxx  combined with spironolactone, which was used as an
antiandrogen. those patients who already had developed central precocious puberty were also treated with gnrh analogue
(laue et al., 1989; leschek et al., 1999). after 1 year of this
combination treatment, the growth rate decreased from 16.1 to
7.5 cm/year. during the subsequent 5 years of treatment, the
growth rate remained normal. similarly, the growth velocity
standard deviation (s.d.) score decreased from 6.9 to 1.1 after 1
year of treatment and continued to be significantly lower during
the next 5 years of treatment. the rate of bone maturation, calculated as the change in the ratio of bone age to chronological age
(ba/ca), decreased from 2.5 to 1.7. after 2 years of treatment,

l. dunkel / molecular and cellular endocrinology 254–255 (2006) 207–216

ba/ca further decreased to 0.8 and remained normal or subnormal for the remainder of the 6 years of treatment. predicted
final height progressively increased after the first year of treatment. by the sixth year, predicted final height had increased from
160.7 cm (pretreatment) to 173.6 cm (p < 0.005). thus, longterm treatment with spironolactone,  xxxd3324xxx , and gnrh
analogue normalizes the rates of growth and bone maturation
and improves predicted final height in boys with fmpp. no adult
height data are available yet from these patients.
3.3. cah
cah is caused by a 21-hydroxylase deficiency that results in
increased production of adrenal androgens and decreased production of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. supraphysiological doses of glucocorticoid are often required for proper
suppression of acth secretion. consequently, signs of glucocorticoid excess, such as obesity and poor growth velocity, are
common among treated children. another common complication is central precocious puberty, which is most likely to develop
when the diagnosis of cah is delayed or when there is poor control of adrenal androgen secretion. excessive adrenal androgen
production, excessive exposure to glucocorticoids, and precocious puberty all may cause short adult stature.
however, short adult stature may result even if good adrenal
hormonal control is maintained throughout childhood and
puberty. in a recent meta-analysis of 561 patients, the average
final height s.d. score of cah patients was −1.37, and final
height s.d. score minus target height s.d. score was −1.21
(eugster et al., 2001). patients whose cah was diagnosed early
had a better outcome, and good compliance was considered beneficial. delay in the diagnosis of cah results in a more severely
compromised prognosis for adult height (eugster et al., 2001;
urban et al., 1978; brook et al., 1974; dimartino-nardi et al.,
1986). conventional medical treatment for cah remains a challenging task, balancing between hypercortisolism and hyperandrogenism, which may lead to compromised adult height.
thus, alternative treatment approaches are needed (consensus
statement, 2002).
in 1 study, 28 children with cah were randomized
to receive treatment for 2 years with either (1)  xxxd2143xxx 
and  xxxd3324xxx , with a reduced hydrocortisone dose (mean,
8.7 ± 0.6 mg/m2 /day) and fludrocortisone (n = 16), or (2) standard treatment with hydrocortisone (12.7 ± 2.9 mg/m2 /day) and
fludrocortisone (n = 12) (merke et al., 2000). the investigators
hypothesized that the clinical effects of excessive androgen and
estrogen concentrations, which would result from a decrease in
the dose of hydrocortisone, could be blocked by the combination
of an antiandrogen ( xxxd2143xxx ) and an inhibitor of androgen-toestrogen conversion ( xxxd3324xxx ) (merke et al., 2000). growth
and bone maturation rates declined significantly in the group
treated with  xxxd2143xxx  and  xxxd3324xxx , despite the reduction
in the hydrocortisone dose and an increase in androgen levels, both of which were expected to increase the growth and
bone maturation rates (height velocity changed from 2.4 ± 0.5 to
0.1 ± 0.5 s.d. score units; p < 0.01; ba/ca changed from
1.9 ± 0.3 to 0.7 ± 0.2). children receiving the additional flu-

211

tamide and  xxxd3324xxx  regimen had some increase in predicted
adult height (from −2.6 ± 0.5 at baseline to −2.0 ± 0.5 s.d.
units after 2 years), though the difference was not statistically
significant (p < 0.30).
four children in the experimental arm and two children in
the control arm were receiving gnrha therapy at the 2-year
follow-up. when data for these six children were excluded
from analysis, children who remained prepubertal at the 2-year
follow-up while on the standard treatment still had higher growth
and bone age maturation rates (ba/ca, 1.2 ± 0.7) compared with children on the  xxxd2143xxx  and  xxxd3324xxx  regimen
(ba/ca, 0.7 ± 0.2), though these differences were not statistically significant. there was no between-treatment difference
in the estrogen levels that were at or below the detection limit of
the radioimmunoassay method used in this study. considerable
vigilance was required for monitoring the safety of  xxxd2143xxx 
due to its potentially severe hepatotoxicity.
3.4. constitutional delay of puberty
one double-blind, placebo-controlled study has been conducted in 23 boys with constitutional delay of puberty (wickman
et al., 2001). at the time of study entry, the mean age was
15.1 ± 0.2 years (range, 13.5–16.1 years), and none of the boys
had had any pubertal increase in growth velocity. the boys were
randomly assigned to receive  xxxd3326xxx  combined
either with letrozole inhibitor or placebo; a group of boys who
received no treatment served as a control group.
in this study, letrozole effectively inhibited estrogen synthesis. the 17␤-estradiol concentration increased during treatment
with placebo and testosterone, and it increased during follow-up
in the untreated group. in contrast, the concentration remained
at the pretreatment level during treatment with letrozole and
testosterone (p = 0.2). however, after discontinuation of letrozole treatment, the 17␤-estradiol concentration increased in the
letrozole + testosterone group, and by 18 months (i.e., 6 months
after discontinuation of treatments), 17␤-estradiol concentrations were similar for patients in all groups.
testosterone concentrations increased in patients from all
three groups. however, from the start of treatment with letrozole and testosterone, the increase in testosterone was more than
five-fold higher (606% increase at 5 months; p = 0.0005) than
during the treatment with placebo and testosterone. this high
concentration was sustained until discontinuation of letrozole
treatment, after which the concentration decreased to a level
comparable with those of the other groups.
after 5 months of treatment with letrozole + testosterone –
in addition to the 606% increase in testosterone concentration
and the unchanged 17␤-estradiol concentration – lh concentration increased by 208% (p = 0.001), follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh) concentration increased by 167% (p = 0.0005), and
gnrh-induced lh response increased by 73% (p = 0.0005).
the gnrh-induced fsh response did not change significantly
(p = 0.08). results after 12 months were similar to those at 5
months. these data show that when the action of endogenous
estrogens is suppressed, lh and fsh concentrations increase
despite very high androgen concentrations. consistent with the

pioneering work by dr. m. grumbach in late 1960s and early
1970s, these data indicate that the negative feedback between
endogenous estrogens and gonadotropin secretion, which has
been reported in adult men (smith et al., 1994; morishima et al.,
1995; carani et al., 1997; bilezikian et al., 1998; hayes et al.,
2000; clarke and cummins, 1982; grumbach et al., 1874), is
already operative from early puberty. furthermore, these observations suggest that androgens have a minor role compared with
estrogens in regulating lh and fsh secretion in early- and midpubertal boys.
notably, when the action of endogenous estrogens was suppressed by letrozole + testosterone treatment in these boys, the
nocturnal lh pulse amplitude increased, but the lh pulse frequency, which is assumed to reflect the frequency of hypothalamic gnrh secretion (clarke and cummins, 1982; levine et al.,
1982), did not change (fig. 3). these observations suggest that in
early- and midpubertal boys, low concentrations of endogenous
estrogens may not influence the gnrh pulse generator and that
the site of action of estrogens is the pituitary. although inhibin
b participates in the regulation of fsh secretion from early- and
midpuberty onward (andersson et al., 1997; raivio et al., 2000),
the increase in fsh concentrations during letrozole treatment is
probably not due to a diminished negative feedback signal from
inhibin b, for inhibin b concentrations increased concurrently
with increased fsh concentrations.
in the group treated with placebo + testosterone, the inhibin b
concentration did not change (wickman et al., 2001). in contrast,
during treatment with letrozole and testosterone, the inhibin b
concentration increased from baseline, but it returned to the pretreatment level after discontinuation of letrozole. the changes
in inhibin b concentration after 5 months of therapy differed
between the two treatment groups (p = 0.01), consistent with the
differences in testis volume and the divergent pattern of change
in gonadotropin concentrations.
concentrations of insulin-like growth factor (igf)-i and igf
binding protein-3 (igfbp-3) increased during treatment with

placebo and testosterone immediately after the start of treatment.
in contrast, during treatment with letrozole and testosterone,
 xxxg1144xxx  and igfbp-3 concentrations remained at pretreatment
levels (wickman et al., 2001).
for the first 5 months of treatment, boys treated with placebo
and testosterone grew slightly faster than boys treated with
letrozole and testosterone (9.9 ± 0.5 cm versus 7.3 ± 0.9 cm,
respectively; p = 0.02). after 5 months, no statistically significant differences in growth velocity were observed between the
two treatment groups, though a slightly higher growth velocity
was observed after discontinuation of treatment in the letrozole + testosterone compared with the placebo + testosterone
group (p = 0.06). inhibition of estrogen synthesis by letrozole
delayed bone maturation. within the 18-month follow-up period,
the bone age increased 1.7 ± 0.3 years in the group treated
with placebo + testosterone and 0.9 ± 0.2 years in the letrozole + testosterone group (p = 0.03). in the untreated group, the
increase was 1.1 ± 0.3 years.
for boys treated with letrozole and testosterone, delayed bone
maturation occurred concurrently with good growth response,
and the result was an increase in predicted adult height (fig. 4)
(wickman et al., 2001). thus, letrozole treatment was associated with the increase in predicted adult height. in fact, an
increase in predicted adult height was seen for all but one boy in
the letrozole + testosterone group (range, 2.5–8.8 cm); predicted
adult height decreased by 3.5 cm for the one remaining boy. in
contrast, in the placebo + testosterone and the untreated groups,
predicted adult height did not change from baseline through 18
months of therapy. this difference between the treated groups in
the change in predicted adult height was statistically significant
(p = 0.04). the mean near-adult height was 6.9 cm higher for
boys treated with letrozole than for boys treated with placebo
(p = 0.04). in placebo-treated boys, the near-adult height was
4.8 cm below target height (p = 0.006); whereas, in letrozoletreated boys, there was no difference between near-adult height
and target height (p = 0.4). also, the near-adult height minus target height was 3.6 cm higher for boys treated with letrozole than
for boys treated with placebo (p = 0.06). these near-adult-height
data support the hypothesis that inhibition of estrogen synthesis
in growing adolescents leads to increased adult height. since
some boys with constitutional delay of puberty do not appear
to exploit their genetic growth potential (crowne et al., 1990;

lafranchi et al., 1991; albanese and stanhope, 1995), we can
assume that these boys will achieve an adult height closer to
their genetic growth potential if the estrogen action is inhibited. ultimately, predicted adult height did not change for boys
who received no treatment or those treated with testosterone
alone; these results are consistent with those of previous studies, which have shown that androgen treatment does not increase
adult height (albanese and stanhope, 1993; martin et al., 1986;
blethen et al., 1984).
3.5. idiopathic short stature
we recently completed a double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled study investigating the effects of 2.5 mg/day letrozole
on bone maturation and predicted adult height in adolescent
boys with idiopathic short stature (hero et al., 2005). during
the 2 years of treatment with letrozole (n = 16) and placebo
(n = 14), bone age advanced by 1.24 and 2.05 years, respectively (fig. 5; p = 0.05). no differences in growth velocity were
observed between the groups. consequently, height for bone age
increased by 0.7s.d. (p < 0.0001), and predicted adult height
increased by 5.9 cm (p < 0.0001) for boys treated with letrozole,
while there were no changes in these measures for placebotreated boys. thus, treatment with ai letrozole delays bone
maturation and increases predicted adult height in boys with
idiopathic short stature. no adverse effects on bone mineralization were observed after 2 years of treatment.
4. safety of aromatase inhibitors
wickman et al. conducted a follow-up study to detect possible side effects of letrozole and to determine bone mineral

densities (bmds) and concentrations of total cholesterol, highdensity lipoprotein (hdl)-cholesterol (c), low-density lipoprotein (ldl)-c, triglycerides, transaminases, and the leukocyte
count following treatment with letrozole + testosterone versus
placebo + testosterone (wickman and dunkel, 2001; wickman
et al., 2002, 2003). the bmd of the lumbar spine increased
from baseline for both treatment groups after 12 and 18
months of therapy. femoral neck bmd increased with the
placebo + testosterone therapy after 12 and 18 months of treatment, but no change was seen in femoral neck bmd in patients
treated with letrozole + testosterone. however, there was no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the
change from baseline in bmds for either the lumbar spine or
femoral neck (wickman et al., 2003). these results suggest that
treatment of pubertal boys for 1 year with a new, specific, and
potent p450 ai is unlikely to have a significantly harmful effect
on bmd.
patients with inactive er␣ (smith et al., 1994) or defective aromatase enzymes (morishima et al., 1995; carani et al.,
1997) show that estrogen is needed for optimal development
of peak bone mass in males. patients with androgen insensitivity syndrome have decreased bmd even before attainment of
peak bone mass (bertelloni et al., 1998; marcus et al., 2000),
indicating the importance of endogenous androgens in development of peak bone mass in males. in the study by wickman
et al., the finding that there were no differences between the
two treatment groups in bmd changes may be explained by
the fact that during letrozole administration, high androgen concentrations compensated for the disadvantages of suppressed
estrogen action. however, these investigators found no statistically significant increase in femoral neck bmd during letrozoleinduced suppression of estrogen action, while femoral neck

a p value refers to the difference between the treatment groups regarding
changes in value from the start to the time-point indicated by p value.

bmd increased in the group treated with placebo + testosterone.
based on these data, we cannot exclude the possibility that p450
ais may have minor disadvantageous effects on developing peak
bone mass during treatment (wickman et al., 2003). thus, close
follow-up of bone metabolism during treatment with ais is
necessary.
wickman et al. also found that the hdl-c concentration
decreased more during treatment with letrozole and testosterone
than during treatment with placebo and testosterone (wickman
et al., 2002). in the placebo + testosterone group, no significant change was observed in the hdl-c concentration during follow-up (p = 0.2; table 2). by comparison, in the letrozole + testosterone group, the hdl-c concentration decreased
from baseline to its lowest level after 5 months of therapy
(p = 0.002), but no subsequent decrease was observed thereafter (table 2). among untreated patients, hdl-c decreased
to its lowest level after 18 months (p = 0.047)—6 months after
discontinuation of all treatments. at 18 months, the hdl-c concentrations were similar in all three groups.
the difference in changes in hdl-c concentration between
boys treated with letrozole + testosterone versus those treated
with placebo + testosterone indicates that letrozole treatment
may have minor adverse effects on serum hdl-c concentrations. further evidence of disadvantageous effects comes from
findings in two aromatase-deficient men who had subnormal
hdl-c concentrations that increased during estrogen adminis-

tration (morishima et al., 1995; carani et al., 1997; bilezikian
et al., 1998). in the letrozole-treated group, the lowest hdlc concentration was observed after 5 months of therapy, and
no subsequent decrease was observed thereafter despite the
continuation of treatment with letrozole. moreover, the hdlc concentration for boys treated with letrozole was similar to
the levels for boys in the placebo-treated and untreated groups
(wickman et al., 2001) after the discontinuation of all treatments,
indicating that 1 year of treatment with letrozole in pubertal boys
is unlikely to have a permanently harmful effect on hdl-c concentration. however, these findings emphasize the importance
of regular monitoring of hdl-c during administration of p450
ais.
previous findings indicate that androgens play an important role in the regulation of hdl-c metabolism in adolescent
boys owing to the inverse association between hdl-c and
testosterone concentration, even when factors affecting lipid
metabolism had been taken into account (morrison et al., 1998,
2000), and to the association between testosterone (kirkland et
al., 1987; arslanian and suprasongsin, 1997) or dihydrotestosterone treatment (saad et al., 2001; applebaum et al., 1977)
and the decrease in hdl-c concentration in boys with delayed
puberty. variations in lipoprotein concentrations in adolescent
boys can be explained to some extent by changes in body mass,
testosterone levels, and estrogen levels and their interactions
(laskarzewski et al., 1983a, 1983b).
estradiol has been shown to act as a germ-cell survival factor
in the human testis in vitro (pentikainen et al., 2000). the role
of estrogen in human spermatogenesis can further be delineated
by the findings in men with a mutation in a gene for er␣ (smith
et al., 1994) and the p450 aromatase enzyme (carani et al.,
1997). a man with a mutation in the er␣ gene had a testis
volume of 20–25 ml, normal sperm density (25 × 106 ml−1 ),
but decreased sperm viability of 18% (normal, >50%) (smith et
al., 1994).
the aromatase-deficient male had a subnormal testicular volume (8 ml) and a decreased sperm count (≤1 × 106 ml−1 ;
normal, >20 × 106 ml−1 ) with 100% immotile spermatozoa
(carani et al., 1997). however, abnormal findings in semen
analysis in the aromatase-deficient man may not be related to
suppression of estrogen action, since azoospermia and infertility were also reported in this man’s brother, who had a
normal p450 aromatase gene (carani et al., 1997). moreover,
the results of semen analysis did not change during treatment
with transdermal estradiol (carani et al., 1997), suggesting
nonestrogen-dependent spermatogenic damage. in our study,
neither placebo + testosterone nor letrozole + testosterone treatment had an adverse effect on testis size or inhibin b concentration (wickman et al., 2001). these findings suggest that 1 year
of treatment with p450 ais in early- and midpubertal boys does
not interfere with spermatogenesis.
5. future use of ais
results of currently published studies indicate that an
increase in adult height may be attained in growing adolescent
boys by inhibition of estrogen action. current findings also sug-

l. dunkel / molecular and cellular endocrinology 254–255 (2006) 207–216

gest that treatment of pubertal boys for 1 year with the new p450
ai letrozole is unlikely to have a significantly harmful effect on
developing peak bone mass. however, we will have to wait until
attainment of peak bone mass, at an age of about 20–25 years in
these boys, to confirm this finding.
bone maturation is delayed by suppressing the action of estrogens in growing children. treatment with modern p450 ais
may thus prove to be efficacious treatment in various growth
disorders. further studies are needed to establish if treatment
with these ais can be useful for conditions such as precocious
puberty and cah associated with significantly advanced bone
age. moreover, ais may be useful for treatment of some boys
with delayed puberty and/or genetic short stature.
