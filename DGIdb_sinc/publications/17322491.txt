abstract
introduction:  xxxd2864xxx  use in acromegaly negates the use of gh levels to monitor disease activity. to
achieve antagonism, plasma concentrations must be w1000-fold greater than gh which with the
high homology between the peptides makes gh measurement a challenge when  xxxd2864xxx  is
present.
objective: we investigated the effect of  xxxd2864xxx  on gh measured using commercially available
assays.
methods: pooled serum samples with gh concentrations !0.38, 3.85 and 7.69 mg/l were spiked with
increasing  xxxd2864xxx  concentrations (9000–494 000mg/l). samples were analysed by the nichols
advantage, dpc immulite 2000, diasorin irma, beckman access dxl, tosoh aia and wallac delfia
assays.
results: with baseline gh !0.38 mg/l measured levels were !0.38 in all assays except nichols,
diasorin and beckman where gh peaked at 1.5, 9.6 and 17.7 mg/l respectively at low  xxxd2864xxx 
concentrations, falling thereafter. with the other two samples, measured gh levels progressively fell
with increasing  xxxd2864xxx  concentrations, except the beckman assay where an increase (30.8 mg/l)
was seen at a  xxxd2864xxx  concentration of 9000 mg/l; and diasorin and tosoh where smaller
increases were seen at lower  xxxd2864xxx  concentrations, levels gradually falling thereafter.
conclusion: the presence of  xxxd2864xxx  resulted in artefactually low measured gh in most assays. we
speculate this fall is due to assay antibody-binding  xxxd2864xxx , reducing the amount of available
antibody to bind actual gh thereby producing less sandwich formation: the ‘high-dose hook’ effect. in
most assays, this effect is modest and results in lower gh, but the level of interference makes them
unsuitable for studies on the influence of  xxxd2864xxx  on gh neuroregulation.

introduction
acromegaly is due to hypersecretion of growth hormone
(gh) usually from a benign pituitary somatotroph
adenoma. circulating gh stimulates the production
of insulin-like growth factor-i ( xxxg1144xxx ), the effector
molecule responsible for many of the signs and
symptoms. gh is a 191-residue peptide which binds to
a preformed dimer of identical transmembrane cell
surface receptors to induce signal activation and  xxxg1144xxx 
generation (1).  xxxd2864xxx  is a new gh competitive
receptor antagonist that has recently been licensed for
use in acromegaly. it is a genetically engineered gh
analogue that differs from wild-type (wt) gh by eight
mutations in the region of binding site 1 (2). a single
amino acid substitution in the region of binding site 2
(an alanine to glycine substitution at position 120)
allows binding to the receptor dimer but prevents the
induction of the conformational change necessary for
q 2007 society of the european journal of endocrinology

gh signal transduction and  xxxg1144xxx  synthesis and secretion
(3). pegylation (conjugation of peg 5000 kda moieties
to lysines in the peptide) of the analogue reduces its
clearance rate, increases circulating half-life and
possibly reduces antigenicity. however, pegylation also
reduces the affinity of  xxxd2864xxx  for the  xxxg890xxx 
which means that to achieve adequate gh antagonism
up to 1000-fold greater concentrations of  xxxd2864xxx 
are needed compared with gh.  xxxd2864xxx  has a
30-fold greater affinity for the  xxxg890xxx 
compared with the  xxxg890xxx  (1, 4).
consensus criteria suggest remission of acromegaly is
achieved when there is normalisation of age- and sexmatched serum  xxxg1144xxx  levels with suppression of serum
gh to !1 mg/l after the administration of 75 g oral
glucose (5, 6). by virtue of its mechanism of action  xxxg1144xxx 
is the sole marker of disease activity in patients receiving
 xxxd2864xxx , as unlike other medical therapies it
makes no attempt to reduce circulating gh levels.

normalisation of  xxxg1144xxx  has been reported in 97%
patients on this therapy with concomitant improvement
in associated intermediary metabolic abnormalities
such as glucose intolerance (7).
 xxxd2864xxx  is commenced at a starting dose of
10 mg/day increasing up to 40 mg/day as necessary to
control serum  xxxg1144xxx  levels. equivalent serum  xxxd2864xxx  concentrations have been measured at up to
50 000 mg/l with these doses (8). serum levels increase
further (up to 80 000 mg/l) with the addition of
octreotide therapy (8). other studies have confirmed
the high  xxxd2864xxx  concentrations required to
achieve gh antagonism with mean doses of around
16 mg/day producing mean plasma  xxxd2864xxx 
concentrations of around 13 330 mg/l (9).
although gh cannot be used as a measure of disease
activity, it may still be measured in research for studies
of gh neuroregulation. there is also the worry that it
may be unintentionally measured and clinical decisions
made upon its results. owing to its high structural
homology to gh, the presence of  xxxd2864xxx  in serum
is likely to result in interference resulting in inaccurate
gh estimations when measured using conventional
assays. special gh assays have been developed eliminating any interference and cross-reactivity, however, this
is only available for research purposes (10, 11).
we aimed to investigate the effect of  xxxd2864xxx  on
gh measurement using six commonly available
commercial assays.

stock solution to give increasing  xxxd2864xxx  concentrations of 9000, 20 000, 41 000, 82 000 and
494 000 mg/l. samples were collected from patients
who had never received treatment with  xxxd2864xxx .
aliquots of the preparations were stored at k20 8c
prior to dispatch to the participating laboratories.
analyses were performed in singlicate.
gh was analysed in each sample using widely
available commercial assays: the nichols advantage,
dpc immulite 2000 (diagnostics products corporation,
gwynned, uk), diasorin irma (diasorin ltd, wokingham, uk), beckman access dxl (beckman coulter uk
ltd, high wycombe, uk), tosoh aia (tosoh
bioscience, inc., san francisco, ca 94080, usa) and
wallac delfia (perkin–elmer life and analytical
sciences, turku, finland; table 1).
all assays are solid phase, two-site immunometric
sandwich assays (table 1). serum samples containing
gh are incubated with an immobilised antibody
(monoclonal) directed against a specific site on the gh
molecule and a labelled second antibody (monoclonal/
polyclonal) used as a tracer directed against a separate
antigenic site. during incubation, the tracer binds to the
solid phase following which the amount of bound
labelled antibody is proportional to the concentration of
gh in the sample. all assays are calibrated to who
nibsc standards.

sample 1 (baseline gh !0.4 mg/l)

a total of 20 mg  xxxd2864xxx  powder was dissolved in
2 ml de-ionised water by mixing at room temperature
for 10 min to give a stock solution of 10 mg/ml
(10 000 mg/ml). three pooled serum samples of
different gh concentrations (gh !0.38, approximately
3.9 and 7.7 mg/l as measured on the nichols advantage
(nichols institute diagnostics, san clemente, ca
92673, usa)) were prepared and ‘spiked’ with the

levels remained !0.4 mg/l in three of the assays
(wallac, tosoh and dpc immulite) at all concentrations
of  xxxd2864xxx . for the beckman access dxl assay,
measured gh levels peaked at 17.7 mg/l at a  xxxd2864xxx  concentration of 20 000 mg/l; for the diasorin
assay gh peaked at 9.8 mg/l at a  xxxd2864xxx 
concentration of 9000 mg/l and in the nichols assay
gh peaked at 1.5 mg/l at a  xxxd2864xxx  concentration

gh was seen at 30 mg/l and the diasorin assay where
measured levels increased to 10 mg/l, in both cases at
 xxxd2864xxx  concentrations of 9000 mg/l. modest
increases were also seen in the tosoh assay. as before
gh levels then fell progressively as the  xxxd2864xxx

sample 3 (baseline gh w7.7 mg/l)
results were similar to those reported when baseline
gh was w3.9 mg/l where a progressive fall in measured
gh was seen with increasing  xxxd2864xxx  concentrations. however a fourfold rise in measured gh was
seen for the beckman access dxl assay to 31.5 mg/l at a
 xxxd2864xxx  concentration of 9000 mg/l and the
diasorin assay peaked at 8.9 mg/l at the same
 xxxd2864xxx  concentration with reduction in gh levels
thereafter (fig. 3).

discussion
we have investigated the effect of differing  xxxd2864xxx 
concentrations on gh measurement using widely
available commercial assays (nichols advantage, dpc
immulite 2000, diasorin irma, beckman access dxl,
tosoh aia and wallac delfia). baseline differences are
seen in gh levels which reflect the known assay bias.
results demonstrate that in most gh assays the

presence of  xxxd2864xxx  leads to a reduction in
measured plasma gh levels with a progressive decline
seen at higher  xxxd2864xxx  concentrations. in three
assays (the nichols advantage, beckman access dxl
and diasorin irma), the progressive fall in gh levels
was preceded by an initial increase. these data confirm
our knowledge that gh cannot be reliably measured in
patients on  xxxd2864xxx  in commercially available
assays, but contradicts previous predictions that crossreactivity would result in artefactually high levels of gh.
we postulate that one of three mechanisms may be
important in the effect of  xxxd2864xxx  on observed gh
concentrations:
1 as stated before, each molecule of  xxxd2864xxx  is
pegylated (peg). peg has historically been used in
immunoassays as part of second antibody separation
procedures where it works not by binding antibody
but enhancing antibody–antigen interactions (by

removing water/hydrophilic residues). although its
presence would not actually bind the antigen or
antibody causing any interference, it is possible that
the sheer concentration of peg present produces
steric hindrance in the sandwich complex binding.
this is particularly likely at the highest concentrations of  xxxd2864xxx  (494 000 mg/l) where there
are four to six molecules of peg present per molecule
of  xxxd2864xxx . this study demonstrates that the
effect of peg in any given assay system is
unpredictable.
2  xxxd2864xxx  could be acting as an antigen binding
to one, but not both, of the antibodies. this would
prevent sandwich formation and therefore decrease
measured gh levels as seen in some assays with
increasing  xxxd2864xxx  concentrations. supporting
this theory are the findings by thorner et al. (10),
who employed two strategies for measuring gh
levels in healthy young men following the administration of  xxxd2864xxx  in doses up to 1 mg/kg. gh
was measured using a modified nichols chemiluminescence assay (empirically corrected for
 xxxd2864xxx  cross-reactivity), and a direct gh
two-site immunoassay using two monoclonal
antibodies with high affinity for gh but no crossreactivity with peg up to a concentration of
50 000 mg/l. concordance in gh levels was found
between the assays with no significant change in
gh levels at any dose.
3 owing to the high structural homology to gh,
 xxxd2864xxx  could act as an antigen binding to
both antibodies and permitting sandwich formation. therefore, measured gh could increase in the
presence of  xxxd2864xxx . however, the ‘high-dose
hook’ effect (excess concentration of  xxxd2864xxx 
results in saturation of available antibody sites
resulting in failure of gh sandwich complex
formation) may act to decrease observed gh as
 xxxd2864xxx  concentration increases. this could
explain the pattern seen in the beckman access dxl
and diasorin irma assays. the range of  xxxd2864xxx  concentrations used in this study was chosen
to reflect levels achieved in clinical practise. further
studies would be necessary to explore the ‘hook
effect’ using lower concentrations of  xxxd2864xxx .
we cannot say with confidence which of these
mechanisms is applicable to any one assay – more
than one may be in play in each assay. however, it
should be noted that the ‘high-dose hook’ effect could
explain all the observations, assuming that the hook
point in those assays that did not show an initial
increase in observed gh actually occurred at some
 xxxd2864xxx  concentration lower than the lowest spike.
given the nature of interference of  xxxd2864xxx  in
commercial assays producing artefactually lower and
higher levels of gh than the predicted excessively high
levels, incorrect interpretations of results could occur.

it may be that gh levels appear of a plausible range, in
keeping with what would be expected and hence are not
recognised as incorrect. therefore, if gh is to be
measured it is critical that specific assays which detect
only true gh levels with no cross-reactivity from the
presence of  xxxd2864xxx  are developed for commercial
use.
in summary, we have demonstrated  xxxd2864xxx  to
interfere negatively with gh with lower levels measured
with higher concentrations of  xxxd2864xxx . in most
assays, the effect of  xxxd2864xxx  at therapeutic
concentrations is modest and results in lower gh, but
the level of interference makes them unsuitable for
studies on the influence of  xxxd2864xxx  on gh
neuroregulation.
