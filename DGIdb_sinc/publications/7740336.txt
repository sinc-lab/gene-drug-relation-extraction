pilot study of  xxxd3516xxx  ( xxxd3516xxx ) and paclitaxel (taxol) in patients with refractory breast cancer and lung cancer.   xxxd3516xxx  ( xxxd3516xxx ; burroughs wellcome co, research triangle park, nc; pierre fabre mÃ©dicament, paris, france) and paclitaxel (taxol; bristol-myers oncology, princeton, nj) as single-agent therapy exhibit good activity in breast and lung cancers. concurrent administration of  xxxd3516xxx  and paclitaxel achieves synergistic cytotoxicity against mcf-7 and mda-mb-231 breast cancer cells in vitro. because these agents bind to distinct sites on tubulin and affect microtubules in opposite ways, a pilot study was conducted of the combination of  xxxd3516xxx  and paclitaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer or lung cancer who were refractory to first-line chemotherapy. entry criteria included measurable disease, a karnofsky performance status of > or = 70, adequate bone marrow reserve, adequate hepatic and renal functions, and no central nervous system metastasis. seven patients entered the study (one with breast cancer and six with lung cancer; three men and four women, with an age range of 39 to 79 years). the first three patients received  xxxd3516xxx  25 mg/m2 intravenously for 5 to 10 minutes on days 1 and 8, and paclitaxel 90 mg/m2 intravenously over 3 hours on day 1 after the administration of  xxxd3516xxx . premedication prior to paclitaxel consisted of dexamethasone, cimetidine, and diphenhydramine. the subsequent four patients enrolled in the study received the identical dose of  xxxd3516xxx , but the paclitaxel dose was increased to 175 mg/m2 in the same sequence. patients received granulocyte  xxxg526xxx  5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously from days 3 to 17 (except day 8) or until the absolute granulocyte count was 10,000/microl or higher. preliminary results showed that one of the first three patients developed grade 4 neutropenia and grade 5 infection. in the subsequent four patients, there were two grade 3 and two grade 4 cases of neutropenia; leukopenic fever or infection did not occur. two patients required red blood cell transfusions. two patients developed grade 1 and one patient developed grade 2 peripheral neuropathy. myalgia and fatigue were common but self-limited. the one patient with breast cancer had a partial response; no response was noted in the lung cancer patients.
