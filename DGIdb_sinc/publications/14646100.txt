1. introduction
l- xxxg2043xxx  (sdh; deaminase; ec
4.2.1.13) catalyzes the  xxxd3047xxx 
(plp) dependent deamination of l-serine to
yield pyruvate. the rat liver enzyme also
catalyzes the conversion of  xxxd3361xxx  to
-ketobutyrate and ammonia by the same
mechanism and is therefore thought to be
identical to  xxxd3361xxx  dehydratase (ec
4.2.1.16; nakagawa, 1971). the primary structures of biosynthetic (lawther et al., 1987) and
biodegradative (datta et al., 1987) threonine
dehydratases from escherichia coli,  xxxd5xxx 
dehydratase from e. coli (schiltz & schmitt,
1981; marceau, mcfall et al., 1988) and
biosynthetic threonine dehydratase from yeast
(kielland-brandt et al., 1984) are now known
and it has been shown that signiÂ®cant sequence
homology exists between these enzymes
(datta et al., 1987). in human liver sdh, plp
binds to lys41 to form a schiff base and its
encompassing amino-acid sequence, ser-xaalys-ile-arg-gly, is well conserved among
sdhs from human (ogawa, gomi et al., 1989),
rat (ogawa, konishi et al., 1989), tomato
(samach et al., 1991), escherichia coli (datta et
al., 1987; eisenstein et al., 1995) and yeast
(john, 1995). the active sites are highly
homologous with those of the microbial
threonine dehydratases. moreover, these
enzymes have a glycine-rich sequence in a
region 100Â±130 amino-acid residues downstream of the plp-binding lysyl residue (datta
et al., 1987). the importance of this motif in the
interaction with the coenzyme was demonstrated by the Â®nding that substitution of the
glycine residues by  xxxd233xxx  residues
impairs plp binding to e. coli  xxxd5xxx 
deaminase (marceau, lewis et al., 1988). these
two conserved sequences suggest that sdhs
and tdhs have evolved from a common
ancestral protein (datta et al., 1987).

in mammals, sdh is found predominantly in
the liver. extensive studies have been carried
out on sdh from rat and the enzyme has been
found to play an important role in gluconeogenesis; its activity is induced by the
consumption of high-protein diets, starvation
and other treatments (snell, 1984; ebara et al.,
2001). however, little is known about the
physicochemical and enzymatic properties of
human sdh, as human liver exhibited low
sdh activity (yoshida et al., 1969). it has been
suggested that vertebrates catabolize serine by
the consecutive actions of serine hydroxymethyltransferase
and
glycine-cleavage
enzymes rather than by sdh under physiological conditions (kikuchi, 1973; xue et al.,
1999). it has also been reported that a case of
non-ketotic hyperglycinaemia was apparently
a consequence of a hereditary deÂ®ciency of
threonine dehydratase (krieger & booth,
1984). in addition,  xxxg2043xxx  activities
were absent in human colon carcinoma and rat
sarcoma (snell et al., 1988). as a result, sdh is
thought to be related to non-ketotic hyperglycinaemia and tumours. this prompted us to
examine the properties of human sdh.
there is presently no known structure of
sdh. in this study, the crystallization and
preliminary crystallographic analysis of human
sdh are reported. the structure of this
protein will be helpful in the illustration of the
properties and function of sdhs.

2. materials and methods
2.1. protein expression and purification

the coding sequence for human serine
dehydratase (35 kda) was ampliÂ®ed from
rt-pcr products from human liver using the
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. two
pcr primers, 50 -ccg gaa ttc atg atg

were designed. the pcr product was
restricted with ecori and xhoi, puriÂ®ed
and ligated into ecori- and xhoi-restricted
sites of the pet28a(+) vector (novagen
inc.) with a t7 tag. a further transformation
into e. coli dh5 competent cells was
performed and positive clones with an insert
of the right size were identiÂ®ed by double
digestion with ecori and xhoi. the
recombinant plasmid was transformed into
e. coli strain bl21 (de3) and the transformants were selected on lb agar plates
containing 25 mg mlÃ¿1 kanamycin. the cells
were then cultured at 310 k in lb medium
containing 50 mg mlÃ¿1 kanamycin. when the
culture density reached a600 ' 0.8, the
culture was induced with 0.5 mm iptg and
was grown for an additional 4 h before the
cells were harvested.
the bacterial cell pellet was resuspended
in lysis buffer (20 mm trisÂ±hcl ph 7.6,
500 mm nacl, 10 mm imidazole, 10%
glycerol) and homogenized by sonication.
the lysate was centrifugated at 20 000g for
30 min to remove the cell debris. the
supernatant was applied to an ni2+-chelating
column (1 ml ni2+Â±nta agarose) and the
contaminant protein was washed off with
lysis buffer. the target protein was eluted
with eluting buffer (20 mm trisÂ±hcl ph 8.0,
500 mm nacl, 200 mm imidazole, 10%
glycerol). the protein was concentrated with
an ultrafree 10 000 nmwl Â®lter unit
(millipore) and was further puriÂ®ed on a
superdex-75 column (pharmacia) in buffer
a (20 mm trisÂ±hcl ph 7.6, 150 mm nacl).
the puriÂ®ed protein was analyzed by sdsÂ±
page.
2.2. crystallization

formed by the hanging-drop vapourdiffusion method at 291 k in 16-well plates.
2 ml protein solution was mixed with 2 ml
reservoir solution containing 0.8 m ammonium sulfate in 0.1 m trisÂ±hcl buffer ph
7.0Â±8.0 and the mixture was equilibrated
against 200 ml reservoir solution at 291 k.
the lemon-shaped crystal appeared after
2Â±3 d.
2.3. x-ray crystallographic studies

preliminary diffraction data sets were
collected at room temperature in-house
using a rigaku ru-2000 rotating-anode
cu k x-ray generator operating at 48 kv
Ãª ) with a mar 345
and 98 ma ( = 1.5418 a
image-plate detector. the beam was focused
using osmic mirrors. for a more detailed
analysis, Â¯ash-cooled crystals were used.
crystals were immersed in cryoprotectant
for 5Â±10 s, picked up in a loop and then
Â¯ash-cooled in a stream of nitrogen gas
cooled to 100 k. the cryoprotectant was
prepared by adding 30% glycerol to the
mother-liquor reservoir. all intensity data
were indexed, integrated and scaled using
the hkl programs denzo and scalepack (otwinowski & minor, 1997).

3. results
crystallization trials were conducted at
291 k in 16-well plates using the hangingdrop vapour-diffusion method. hampton
research kits (riverside, ca, usa) were
used to supply sets of screening reagents for
initial screening. although wide ranges of
conditions were screened, the crystallization
of human sdh was initially unsuccessful.
eventually, we found the protein to crystal-
