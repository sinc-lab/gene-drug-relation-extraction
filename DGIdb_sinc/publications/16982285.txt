abstract
background: dopamine agonists (das), which can
be categorized as ergot derived and non-ergot derived,
are used in the treatment of parkinson's disease.
objectives: this review describes the pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties of selected das
and relates these characteristics to clinical outcomes,
with an emphasis on adverse events.
methods: relevant articles were identified through
a search of medline (to may 2006) using the terms
dopamine agonists (or each individual drug name) and

pharmacokinetics, metabolism, drug-drug interaction,
interactions, cyp450, fibrosis, valvular heart disease,
tremor, clinical trials, reviews, and meta-analyses.
abstracts from recent sessions of the international
congress of parkinson's disease and movement
disorders were also examined. clinical studies with
<20 patients overall or <10 patients per treatment
group in the final analysis were excluded. all das that
were graded at least possibly useful with respect to at
least 3 of 4 items connected to the treatment/prevention
of motor symptoms/complications in the most recent
evidence-based medical review update were included.
this resulted in a focus on the ergot-derived das bromocriptine, cabergoline, and pergolide, and the nonergot-derived das pramipexole and  xxxd3145xxx .
results: bromocriptine, cabergoline, pergolide, and
 xxxd3145xxx , but not pramipexole, have the potential for
drug-drug interactions mediated by the cytochrome
p450 (cyp) enzyme system. the occurrence of dyskinesia may be linked to stimulation of the dopamine
d 1 receptor, for which cabergoline and pergolide have
a similar and relatively high affinity; bromocriptine,
pramipexole, and  xxxd3145xxx  have been associated
with a lower risk of dyskinesias. the valvular heart
disease (vhd) and pulmonary and retroperitoneal fibrosis seen with long-term use appear to represent
a class effect of the ergot-derived das that may be related to stimulation of serotonin 5-ht2b (and possibly
august 2006

5-ht2a ) receptors. the incidence of valvular regurgitation was 31% to 47% with ergot-derived das, 10%
with non-ergot-derived das, and 13% with controls.
conclusions: as reflected in the results of the clinical trials included in this review, dyskinesia associated
with da therapy may be linked to stimulation of the
d 1 receptor. fibrosis (including vhd) seemed to be a
class effect of the ergot-derived das. each of the das
except pramipexole has the potential to interact with
other drugs via the cyp enzyme system. (clin ther.

introduction

dopamine agonists (das) are used in the treatment of
parkinson's disease (pd) and other disorders involving
dopaminergic dysfunction (eg, restless legs syndrome
[rls]). 1 they can be categorized as ergot derived
(bromocriptine, cabergoline, and pergolide) and nonergot derived ( xxxd3145xxx  and pramipexole). das are
considered first-line treatment for functional impairment in pd, 2 with the addition of l-dopa for further
symptomatic improvement. the most common adverse effects (aes) associated with da therapy are
nausea, somnolence, insomnia, dizziness, postural hypotension, anorexia, edema, hallucinations, and dyspepsia, g-5 because pd and rls are more prevalent
among the elderly, 1,s it may be common for such paaccepted for publication june 27, 2006.

tients to have comorbid conditions (eg, depression in
pd 7-9) and take concurrent medications. therefore,
understanding the pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties of the das is crucial to achieving an optimal outcome and avoiding aes in this population at
risk for potential drug-drug interactions. it must be
underscored, however, that clinical outcomes of drug
therapy are influenced by many factors other than receptor affinities (eg, age, sex, weight, race, compliance,
bioavailability, concomitant diseases, renal/hepatic
function).
van camp et al 1° reported a correlation between
valvular heart disease (vhd)/fibrosis and high doses
of pergolide (_>5 mg/d), as well as a correlation between tenting area of the mitral valve and the cumulative dose of pergolide. baseman et a111 reported that
composite regurgitation was a function of lifetime
pergolide use. an association between aes and high
doses of das also was seen in the study by reuter et
al, 12 in which 50 pd patients at a rehabilitation unit
(mean age, 64 years; hoehn-yahr grade, 2-4) were
evaluated by echocardiography. a valvular scoring
system was used that ranged from 1 (mild valvular
disease) to 3 (severe valvular disease). thirteen patients, 12 of whom had previously been treated with
high doses of pergolide, were found to have clinically
significant restrictive vhd. there was a correlation
between past pergolide treatment and vhd (r = 0.478;
p < 0.001), particularly with past receipt of high pergolide doses (r = 0.94; p = 0.001). a recent study by
kim et al, 13 in which 22 patients with pd received bromocriptine (mean dosage, 8.48 mg/d) and 36 patients
with pd received pergolide (mean dosage, 1.13 mg/d),
failed to find a significant correlation between da
dose and the frequency of valvulopathy. the authors
hypothesized that this may have been the result of
the relatively low doses used, also suggesting an
association between da dose and aes. high doses of
das have been correlated with high plasma concentrations. 14q7 therefore, drug-drug interactions
leading to similar high plasma concentrations may
lead to more and/or more severe aes. on the other
hand, lack of drug efficacy due to induction of
cytochrome p450 (cyp) enzymes may lead to lack of
efficacy.
the major aims of this review were to provide a
comprehensive overview of the pharmacologic and
pharmacokinetic properties of the ergot-derived and
non-ergot-derived das, to highlight the differences
1066

between das, and to discuss the clinical relevance of
these differences with respect to aes and efficacy.
materials a n d m e t h o d s

a search of medline for relevant english-language
publications (to may 2006) was conducted using the
terms dopamine agonists (or each individual drug
name) and pbarmacokinetics, metabolism, drug-drug

interaction, interactions, cyp450, fibrosis, valvular
heart disease, and tremor. separate searches limited
to clinical trials, reviews, and meta-analyses were conducted using the term dopamine agonists (or each individual drug name).
abstracts from the eighth (2004) and ninth (2005)
international congress of parkinson's disease and
movement disorders were searched, and 2 web sites
that provide current information on cyp interactions
and metabolism were consulted. 18,19 to find complete
receptor-affinity data for das from experiments on
cloned human dopamine receptors when the receptors were in the "high-affinity state, ''2° a search of
boehringer-ingelheim publications (including languages other than english) was conducted.
clinical studies enrolling <20 patients overall or including <10 patients per treatment group in the final
analysis were excluded from the review. all das that
were considered at least possibly useful with respect
to at least 3 of 4 items connected to the treatment/
prevention of motor symptoms/complications in the most
recent evidence-based medical review update 21 were included. this resulted in a focus on the ergot-derived
das bromocriptine, cabergoline, and pergolide, and the
non-ergot-derived das pramipexole and  xxxd3145xxx .

it has been suggested that d 3 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway may be involved in behavior and mood, 22
which may be associated with the antidepressive and
antianhedonic effects seen with certain d3-receptorselective central nervous system agents. 22,23 it has been
proposed that the motor benefits of the das (improvements in unified parkinson disease rating scale scores,
wearing-off effect [end-of-dose deterioration], and/or
dyskinesia) are mainly the result of d2-receptor stimulation, as the anatomic distribution of dopamine receptors suggests that areas rich in d 2 sites (caudate and
putamen) are involved in motor control. 22

on the other hand, it has been suggested that d 3receptor loss may play a greater role than d2-receptor
changes in a reduced response to dopaminergic
drugs. 24 this possibility was investigated by measuring striatal dopamine loss and changes in striatal
d 2 and d 3 receptors in the postmortem striatum of
patients with pd (n = 23) and controls (n = 21).
historically, 9 of the pd patients had continued to
have a clinical response to dopaminergic drugs,
whereas 14 had lost the response to these agents. all
pd patients, regardless of responder status, had elevations in d2-receptor concentrations in the rostral striaturn compared with controls (p < 0.005 in the dorsal
putamen). in contrast, there were significant differences in d3-receptor concentrations between responders and nonresponders. with respect to the rostral
striatum, the responder pd group had 13% elevations
in d3-receptor concentrations in the caudate nucleus
and 17% elevations in the dorsal putamen compared
with controls, whereas the nonresponder pd group
had 17% to 28% reductions in d3-receptor concentrations in the caudate nucleus, dorsal putamen, ventral putamen, and nucleus accumbens compared with
controls (p < 0.005). with respect to the caudal striatum, the responder pd group had 31% elevations in
d3-receptor concentrations in the caudate nucleus,

et

al.

36% elevations in the dorsal putamen, and 24% elevations in the nucleus accumbens compared with nonresponders (p < 0.005). the control group had
elevated d3-receptor concentrations in the caudate
nucleus and putamen compared with all pd patients
(p < 0.005). the pd responder group had elevations
in d3-receptor concentrations in the putamen, globus
pallidus interna, and globus pallidus externa compared with nonresponders (p < 0.005), whereas concentrations of d 3 receptors were significantly elevated
in the globus pallidus interna and externa in pd responders compared with controls (p < 0.005). the authors concluded that the loss of d 3 receptors was
associated with a loss in response to antiparkinson
drugs and suggested that stimulation of d 3 receptors
by antiparkinson drugs could be considered a potential
therapeutic target in pd.
the ae profiles of the das appear to be related
mainly to their individual affinities for dopaminergic 25 and serotonergic (5-ht) receptors, 1°-12,25-29
which are summarized in table i. all ergot-derived
das have a high affinity for the 5-ht2a and 5-ht2b
receptors. it has been suggested that activation of
5-ht2a receptors 32 and 5-ht2b receptors 1°,11,28,33 may
mediate fibrotic reactions, including the vhd that has
been associated with ergot-derived das. baseman et

a111 investigated this association by mailing a survey
to all their patients believed to be receiving pergolide treatment. when the 46 responders (mean age,
67 years) who wished to continue pergolide treatment
underwent echocardiography, 41 were found to have
some degree of valvular regurgitation (vr), with documented valve thickening in 15. compared with agedmatched controls from the framingham heart study,
the odds ratio (or) for abnormal valves in pergolide
recipients was 3 (p < 0.03). the sum of scores for all
4 valves (maximum composite valve score, 16) was a
function of lifetime pergolide use. based on curve
data, the mean composite valve score for lifetime use
of 100 mg was -2, and the corresponding value for
lifetime use of 10,000 mg was -5.
van camp et al 1° performed an echocardiographic
evaluation of 78 pd patients treated with pergolide
and 18 control patients with pd who had never received ergot-derived das, using a scoring system from
1 to 4, with 1 indicating documented restrictive vhd
and 4 indicating no restrictive vhd. restrictive vhd
of any type (score 1-3) was found in 33% of the pergolide group and none of the control group (p <
0.003), and clinically significant disease (score 1-2)
was found in 19% of the pergolide group and none
of the control group (p = ns). histopathologic data
from 1 patient indicated an ergotlike valvular lesion
(ie, fibrotic changes in leaflets and subvalvular apparatus). interestingly, there was a significant correlation
between cumulative doses of pergolide and tenting
areas in the mitral valves (r = 0.412; p = 0.017).
the 2 foregoing studies had several limitations.
neither was prospective. there were no baseline data,
even though age-matched controls were used, and only
in the study by van camp et al 1° were the controls pd
patients. in the study by baseman et al, 11 46% of the
patients who were eligible for the study terminated
pergolide treatment when they were informed about
the potential for fibrosis or declined to undergo examination. in addition, 33 pergolide patients in the database were lost to follow-up, van camp et al provided
no information about whether patients declined examination or terminated pergolide treatment when informed about the potential for fibrosis.
horvath et al 2s reported 4 cases of vhd with
ergot-derived das (1 treated with cabergoline, 3 with
pergolide). one of the pergolide patients underwent
tricuspid valve replacement surgery, and there was a
histopathologic finding of noninflammatory fibrotic
1068

degeneration. although the sample was small, one
possible interpretation of the findings is that vhd is
a chronic process taking years to become clinically apparent (1.5-5 years of therapy in these 4 cases).
in 2002, the united kingdom committee on safety
of medicines reported 79 cases of fibrotic reactions in
patients treated with ergot-derived das (3 of whom
died). 32 when given written and verbal information
about potential aes, 88 of 99 patients treated with
ergot-derived das at a regional movement disorder
clinic elected to switch to a non-ergot-derived da. 33
it has been suggested that the occurrence of dyskinesia in patients receiving antiparkinson medication is
related to dl-receptor affinity. 34 bromocriptine, with a
presumed lower risk for dyskinesia, has dl-antagonistic
properties, 35 whereas pergolide and cabergoline, which
are associated with a relatively higher risk for dyskinesia, have dl-agonist properties. 36
the selected das are reviewed in detail in the following sections. their pharmacokinetic properties are
summarized in table ii, and their potential for inhibition by or induction of the cyp enzyme system is
summarized in table iii.

bromocriptine

pharmacology and clinical effects
bromocriptine is indicated for use in pd and reproductive medicine. 39 in addition to its d2-receptoragonist activity, bromocriptine has dl-receptor antagonistic properties. 35 it has a relatively high affinity for
5-ht2a receptors (inhibition constant [ki] = 107 nmol/l)
and 5-ht2b receptors (ki = 56 nmol/l), being a partial
agonist of the latter. 31
the incidence of dyskinesia was compared in patients treated with bromocriptine or cabergoline (a
dl-receptor agonist 31) in a meta-analysis by clarke
and deane. 36 the analysis included a total of 1071 patients from 5 randomized, double-blind, parallelgroup studies, 4 of them short term (12-15 weeks)
and 1 of medium duration (36 weeks). the incidence
of dyskinesia as an ae was significantly greater for cabergoline compared with bromocriptine (or = 1.57;
p = 0.03). this finding may be associated with bromocriptine's strong dl-receptor antagonism. 31 a weakness of this meta-analysis was the short duration of
the studies.
the ergot-derived das' relatively high affinity for
5-ht2a and 5-ht2b receptors may be related to revolume 28 number 8

ports of retroperitoneal and pulmonary fibrosis with
these agents, 32 as well as to the risk for severe multivhd. 28 in addition to 246 fibrotic syndromes associated with bromocriptine therapy described by mtiller
and fritze, 32 there is a published report of fibrotic
vhd after bromocriptine treatment. 4° in this case, a
63-year-old man who had been treated with bromocriptine for 5 years (mean dosage, 40 mg/d) experienced anasarca and was admitted to the intensive
care unit, where fibrosis was discovered in 3 valves.
bromocriptine treatment was continued for 2 months
before being discontinued. six months after the cessation of bromocriptine, there was no worsening in the
valvular fibrosis, and the inflammatory process had
resolved.

metabolism and drug-drug interactions
as a result of its low k i (50% inhibitory concentration [ics0] = 1.69 lamol/l) with respect to inhibition of cyp3a4, 41 which is the most abundant
isozyme in the liver and intestine, bromocriptine may
inhibit and thus increase plasma concentrations of
other cyp3a4 substrates (eg, simvastatin, codeine,
zopiclone). bromocriptine is also metabolized by
cyp3a4, 41 which may lead to inhibition of its metabolism. in a study in 5 male volunteers who received
a single dose of bromocriptine 5 mg alone and after
4 days of treatment with the cyp3a4 inhibitor erythromycin (250 mg qid), 42 with serial blood sampling
over a 12-hour period, the auc for bromocriptine
was increased 268% (ie, increased plasma concentration). based on the results of in vivo studies of other
drugs metabolized by cyp3a4, 43m5 there is a potential for failure of bromocriptine therapy when given
with substances such as st. john's wort, which can induce cyp3a4. 44,45
no published data on the linearity of bromocriptine's pharmacokinetics were found.
cabergoline

pharmacology and clinical effects
cabergoline is indicated for use in pd (except in the
united states) and reproductive medicine. 46 in addition
to its d2-type receptor-agonist activity, cabergoline has
a relatively high affinity for dl-type receptors and high
affinity for 5-ht2a (ki = 6.2 nmol/l) and 5-ht2b (ki =
1.2 nmol/l) receptors.
in the previously mentioned meta-analysis, 36 the
incidence of dyskinesia (reported as an ae) was signifi1070

cantly increased with cabergoline compared with bromocriptine (or = 1.57; p = 0.03), which may be related
to dl-agonist or dl-antagonist activity on the part of
cabergoline. another meta-analysis included 3 large
multicenter, randomized, double-blind studies: one in
which 412 patients received either cabergoline, titrated from 0.25 mg/d to a maximum of 4 mg/d,
or l-dopa 100 to 600 mg/d for 5 years; a second in
which 301 patients received either pramipexole 1.5 to
4.5 mg/d or l-dopa 300 to 600 mg/d for 2 years; and
a third in which 268 patients received either  xxxd3145xxx , titrated from 0.75 mg/d to a maximum of 24 mg/d,
or l-dopa 50 to 1200 mg/d for 5 years. 47 all 3 studies
allowed the use of rescue l-dopa. the meta-analysis
found that the incidence of dyskinesia compared with
l-dopa was less likely to be reduced with cabergoline
(or = 0.38; p < 0.008) than with pramipexole (or =
0.25; p < 0.001) or  xxxd3145xxx  (or = 0.31; p < 0.001),
again suggesting that cabergoline may have some d 1agonist activity. because there were differences in the
definition of dyskinesia used in the individual studies,
the authors of the meta-analysis stated that the results
should be interpreted with caution.
reports of retroperitoneal and pulmonary fibrosis 32 and a potentially increased risk for vhd 28,29 may
be related to cabergoline's high affinity for 5-ht2a and
5-ht2b. miiller and fritze 32 reviewed reports of fibrotic syndromes during da treatment in the database of
the world health organization collaborating centre
for international drug monitoring in uppsala,
sweden. the total number of reports for bromocriptine, cabergoline, pergolide, pramipexole, and  xxxd3145xxx  were a respective 246, 13, 131, 0, and 7. the
authors suggested that patients receiving long-term da
treatment should be monitored carefully for the development of drug-induced fibrotic syndromes. weaknesses of reports based on such databases include
differences in reporting procedures, defined daily
doses, and time since drug launch. as noted by
horvath et al, 28 analyses based on reports in databases may find a lower frequency of fibrotic syndromes
for the das with the most recent launch dates. in addition, because no information is available on patients' drug history or other variables, some reports
may reflect fibrotic syndromes associated with previous rather than current da treatment.
as noted earlier, horvath et a128 reported 4 new
cases of vhd in pd patients treated with ergotderived das. in the case involving cabergoline, the pavolume 28 number 8

tient was a 5g-year-old woman who had received the
drug for 20 months. she complained of shortness of
breath during effort, which worsened rapidly. she was
found to have severe mitral regurgitation, moderate to
severe aortic and tricuspid regurgitation, and mild
pulmonary regurgitation. retraction and thickening of
the free aspects of these valves were also documented. there was no evidence of infectious or inflammatory heart disease, nor did the medical history suggest
congenital heart disease or childhood rheumatic fever.
on discontinuation of cabergoline and treatment with
pramipexole, the symptoms improved slowly over
23 months of follow-up with no specific therapy.
the regression of valvular insufficiency and marked
clinical improvement after discontinuation of cabergoline suggests a potential causal relationship. in another case report, 4s a 63-year-old man who had been
treated with cabergoline 2 mg/d for 3 years received a
diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis. a radical pericardectomy was performed, and florid chronic inflammation was confirmed. cabergoline treatment
was not discontinued. the patient felt unwell after
6 months, and an inflammatory fibrotic reaction
caused by cabergoline was diagnosed. modest improvement was reported 4 months after discontinuation of cabergoline.

a recent study addressed concerns about valvulopathy by determining the frequency of vr through routine transthoracic echocardiography of 75 pd patients
who received da treatment for a minimum of 12 months
(13 cabergoline, 29 pergolide, 33 pramipexole/
 xxxd3145xxx ) and 49 age-matched controls without
pd. 29 patients receiving pergolide had the longest da
exposure (mean duration of therapy, 61.3 months),
followed by  xxxd3145xxx  (45.g months), pramipexole
(40.2 months), and cabergoline (29.9 months). vr
was graded from 1 (mild) to 3 (severe), as described by
baseman et al. u as shown in the figure, the frequency
of vr grades 2 and 3 was significantly higher with the
ergot-derived das compared with the non-ergotderived das (cabergoline, p = 0.009; pergolide, p =
0.031) and compared with controls (cabergoline, p =
0.04; pergolide, p = 0.013). the majority (67%-g3%)
of patients with grade 2 or 3 vr had muhivalvular involvement. echocardiographic evidence of restrictive
valvular changes with leaflet thickening was observed
in 2 patients (1 receiving cabergoline, 1 receiving pergolide), neither of whom had clinical signs of heart
failure. only 1 patient (pergolide) with vr grades 2 or
3 had clinical symptoms of heart failure. among patients with grade 2 or 3 vr who had been treated with
ergot-derived das, treatment was discontinued in 4 of

therapeutics

9 receiving pergolide and 4 of 6 receiving cabergoline.
two of the 4 pergolide-treated patients showed improvement 6 to 12 months after discontinuation of
therapy: one had a change in mitral regurgitation from
grade 2-3 to grade 1, and the other had a change in
aortic regurgitation from grade 3 with thickening of
the posterior leaflet to grade 2 with normal leaflet
morphology. one of the 4 cabergoline-treated patients
showed improvement 6 to 10 months after discontinuation of therapy, with a change in mitral regurgitation
from grade 2 to grade 1. the authors noted that assessment of vr alone may not be sufficiently sensitive to
detect subtle fibrotic changes. they stated that the
higher prevalence of vr with the ergot-derived das,
as well as the partial reversibility of vr on discontinuation of these agents in some cases, suggested a causal
relationship.
this study was limited by its retrospective design;
lack of baseline data; small number of patients, which
may have masked a potential rare valvulopathy related to use of non-ergot-derived das; and small number of patients treated with cabergoline. in addition,
2 cabergoline patients with a vr grade 2 or 3 had previous short-term exposure (1-6 months), one to pergolide and the other to bromocriptine; this was, however, followed by cabergoline treatment for 4 and
6 years, respectively.
a relationship between agonism at 5-ht2b receptors and cardiac valvulopathy was suggested by a
recent ex vivo study of  xxxg1114xxx -mediated relaxation in porcine pulmonary arteries with the ergotderived das bromocriptine, cabergoline, pergolide,
 xxxd2498xxx , and terguride. 31 like 5-ht, cabergoline
(pecs0 [negative logarithm of the molar concentration
producing 50% of the response] = 8.72) and pergolide
(pecs0 = 8.72) produced a concentration-dependent
relaxation in porcine pulmonary arteries. bromocriptine behaved as a partial agonist. although studies of
this type have limited predictive value, the results did
support the previously suggested mechanism for vhd
induced by ergot-derived das.
dhawan et a149 conducted a retrospective data review that included 234 patients who had participated
in >1 trial of cabergoline therapy (mean duration of
treatment, 2.9 years; mean dosage, 3.75 mg/d). they
reviewed patients' case notes for evidence of symptoms suggesting pleuropulmonary, cardiac, or retroperitoneal fibrosis and identified 15 possible cases.
echocardiography was performed in 8 of these pa1072

tients, 6 of whom were found to have grade 1 or 2 regurgitation in >1 valve (atrial, mitral, or tricuspid).
the authors did not find a definitive association between valvular fibrosis and cabergoline therapy, with
the possible exceptions of 1 case of probable alveolitis and 1 case of cardiac murmur. this study was limited by its retrospective design and a patient sample
restricted to those who had met the inclusion criteria
of the clinical trials. the lack of systematic lungfunction and echocardiographic assessments constituted a major limitation. in studies in which all patients were followed regularly by echocardiographic
examination, most patients with high vr scores had
no clinical symptoms. 2<29 as suggested earlier, valvular fibrosis is likely to be a chronic process that may
continue for years before symptoms become manifest. 28 thus, this study may have underestimated the
prevalence of vr and vhd.

metabolism and drug-drug interactions
cabergoline has an elimination tl/2 of 63 to
110 hours16; therefore, achievement of steady state is
expected to take >3 weeks after the completion of dose
titration. the literature review identified no studies that
calculated cabergoline's k i with respect to cyp3a4 inhibition, but it has been suggested that an ability to inhibit this isozyme reflects a catalytic interaction among
structurally similar ergot-derived compounds. 41
like the other ergot-derived das bromocriptine and
pergolide, cabergoline is a substrate for cyp3a4 and is
metabolized primarily by this enzyme, s° there is a report of  xxxd3426xxx % increase in plasma levels of cabergoline
(administered at 4 mg/d) when coadministered with the
potent cyp3a4 inhibitor itraconazole (administered at
200 mg bid for 1 week), sl in 2 patients who served as
controls, receiving only pd medication that included cabergoline, plasma cabergoline levels were stable. the
cmax for cabergoline was increased when the drug was
coadministered with clarithromycin, another cyp3a4
inhibitor, in 10 healthy male volunteers and 7 pd
patients taking stable doses of cabergoline, s° both volunteers and pd patients received cabergoline and clarithromycin 400 mg/d concomitantly for 6 days.
cabergoline concentrations over 10 hours after dosing
increased 2.6-fold (p < 0.01) in healthy volunteers and
1.7-fold in pd patients (p < 0.01). furthermore, when
grapefruit juice was coadministered with cabergoline in
5 pd patients, the mean concentration of cabergoline
increased 1.7-fold. s2 as reported in vivo for other
volume 28 number 8

t. kvernmo et al.

cyp3a4-metabolized drugs 4345,53 and as may be the
case for bromocriptine, cyp3a4 induction may result
in reduced cabergoline concentrations.
cabergoline's pharmacokinetics have been shown
to be linear, but only up to 1.5 mg/d, which is below
the therapeutic dosing range for pd. according to the
summary of product characteristics for cabergoline, 46
coadministration with antibiotics such as clarithromycin should be avoided due to the risk of increased plasma cabergoline concentrations.
pergolide

pharmacology and clinical effects
pergolide is indicated for the treatment of pd. s4 in
addition to its d2-type receptor-agonist activity, pergolide has agonist activity at dl-type receptors 34 and a
high affinity for 5-ht2a (ki = 8.3 nmol/l) and 5-ht2b
(ki = 7.1 nmol/l) receptors. it is a confirmed agonist
of the latter. 31
a recent randomized controlled trial compared pergolide with l-dopa for the prevention of motor complications in patients with early pd. ss this study differed
from other comparisons of das and l-dopa in that
l-dopa rescue therapy was prohibited and disease severity was substantially lower (modified hoehn-yahr
grade, 1-1.5). an inclusion criterion for this study was
a positive result on the apomorphine test, which predicted a high responder rate. two hundred ninety-four
l-dopa-naive patients were randomly assigned to receive pergolide (n = 148) or l-dopa (n = 146). at the
3-year end point, daily doses were 3.23 mg and 504 mg,
respectively. there was a significantly higher incidence
of dyskinesia at 3 years with l-dopa compared with
pergolide (p < 0.001), whereas there was no significant
difference with respect to motor complications (fluctuations and wearing-off effect).
in a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial, s6 patients with advanced pd (hoehn-yahr grade
2-4; minimum total weighted pd score of 60 for a
combination of speech, tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia,
postural stability, and gait on the modified columbia
scale; moderately severe dyskinesia [wearing-off effect]) received pergolide added to l-dopa (n = 189) or
placebo plus l-dopa (n = 187). at the end of the study,
the prevalence and severity of dyskinesia were the same
in both groups. the mean dosages in the 2 treatment
groups were pergolide 2.94 mg/d + l-dopa 671 mg/d
and l-dopa 894 mg/d, respectively. in addition to a
significant reduction in l-dopa dosage compared with
august 2006

the placebo group (p < 0.001), the pergolide group
also had a significant improvement in the total pd
score (p < 0.001).
reports of retroperitoneal and pulmonary fibrosis31
and an increased risk for vhd 10-12'26-29may be related to
pergolide's high affinity for 5-ht2a and 5-ht2b receptors. the frequency of vr with pergolide (31%) was similar to that with cabergoline (47%) (figure).> the risk for
vhd with pergolide appears to be dose dependent. 1°,12
although the previously described studies 1°-13,2s,29and
the preliminary results from van camp et a126in 10 patients treated with high doses of pergolide (>5 mg)
suggest a cumulative dose relationship, this is in contrast to a case report of the development of multivalvular dysfunction in a 63-year-old man treated with
low-dose pergolide (titrated from 0.1 to 2.25 mg/d) for
9 years, s7 histopathologic findings revealed fibromyoid valvulopathy of the mitral, tricuspid, and aortic
valves with no calcification.

metabolism and drug-drug interactions
pergolide is a potent inhibitor of cyp2d6 (ics0 =
0.08 tlmol/l), comparable to paroxetine (k i =
0.15 tlmol/l) and quinidine (ki = 0.03 l~mol/l), 41 and
may theoretically interact with other cyp2d6 substrates (eg, tricyclic antidepressants, antiarrythmics).
pergolide appears to be metabolized by cyp3a441;
thus, coadministration with a cyp3a4 inhibitor may
result in increased concentrations of pergolide, as has
been noted in vivo for both bromocriptine 42 and cabergoline, s°-s2,ss as with other cyp3a4-metabolized
drugs, 434s,s3 subtherapeutic plasma concentrations may
result if pergolide is coadministered with cyp3a4
inducers.
pergolide's pharmacokinetics are linear up to 3 mg/d,
which is slightly more than half the therapeutic dosing
range for pd treatment.

pramipexole

pharmacology and clinical effects
pramipexole is indicated for pd in the united
states and the european union and for rls in the
european union. s9 in addition to its agonist activity at
d 2 receptors, pramipexole has an even higher affinity
for d 3 receptors and a very low affinity for 5-ht2a ,
5-ht2b receptors, and dl-type receptors.
the previously described meta-analysis found that
the likelihood of a reduction in dyskinesia compared
1073

clinical therapeutics
with l-dopa was greater with pramipexole (or -0.25; p -- 0.001) than with cabergoline (or -- 0.38;
p < 0.008), which may reflect the different affinities of
these 2 da agonists for the d 1 receptor. 47
in the study by joyce et al, 24 loss of d 3 receptors
was correlated with a loss in response to antiparkinson drugs. because stimulation of d 3 receptors may
be considered a potential therapeutic target in pd, the
significant tremorlytic effect observed in 2 studies
(both, p < 0.001) 6°,61 may be associated with pramipexole's selectivity for d 3 receptors.

metabolism and drug-drug interactions
pramipexole undergoes almost no hepatic biotransformation (90% is excreted unchanged in the urine) 15
and was found to exert no potent cyp inhibition in
vitro (ki >10 tlmol/l).41 coadministration of pramipexole with other drugs that are renally secreted by
the cationic transport system decreased the clearance
of pramipexole by 9.0% to 17.7%, which was not felt
to warrant a priori dose adjustment. 62 the presence of
reduced creatinine clearance may require dose adjustment. 56 pramipexole has linear pharmacokinetics over
its entire therapeutic range, and its auc is 35% to
43% higher in women than in men. 62

 xxxd3145xxx 

pharmacology and clinical effects
 xxxd3145xxx  is indicated for the treatment of pd; in
the united states and some members of the european
union, it is also indicated for rls. 63 in addition to agonist activity at d2-type receptors,  xxxd3145xxx  has a
very low affinity for 5-ht2a, 5-ht2b, and dl-type
receptors.
the previously described meta-analysis found that
a reduction in dyskinesia compared with l-dopa was
more likely with  xxxd3145xxx  (or = 0.31; p < 0.001)
than with cabergoline (or = 0.38; p < 0.008), 47
which may reflect the different dl-receptor affinities
of the 2 da agonists.

metabolism and drug-drug interactions
 xxxd3145xxx  is extensively cleared by hepatic metabolism, with only 10% excreted as unchanged  xxxd3145xxx . the main enzyme responsible for its metabolism
is cyp1a2, along with cyp3a4.14 an in vitro study
found  xxxd3145xxx  to be a potent inhibitor of cyp2d6
(ic50 -- 0.54 l~mol/l)41 and a less potent inhibitor of
cyp1a2 (10 tlmol/l of  xxxd3145xxx  reduced activity

1074

by 36%). as a strong inhibitor of cyp2d6,  xxxd3145xxx  may interact with other cyp2d6 substrates, 41 although no in vivo studies of cyp2d6 inhibition by
 xxxd3145xxx  were identified in the literature search.
with respect to its potential interaction via
cyp1a2,  xxxd3145xxx  did not interact with the cyp1a2
substrate theophylline in a study in 12 patients with
pd. 64 patients received oral  xxxd3145xxx  titrated to
6 mg/d over 4 weeks and then continued at this dosage
for 4 weeks. oral theophylline was coadministered at
doses up to 600 mg/d from day 28 to day 40 of  xxxd3145xxx  treatment without significantly altering the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3145xxx . when a single 30-minute
infusion of  xxxd150xxx  5 mg/kg was given on days 0
and 27 of the same study,  xxxd3145xxx  did not alter the
pharmacokinetics of intravenous theophylline. when
the cyp1a2 inhibitor ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid was
coadministered with  xxxd3145xxx  titrated to 6 mg/d in
12 patients with pd, 14 the  xxxd3145xxx  auc increased
by 84%. the clearance of  xxxd3145xxx  was decreased by
-33% in female pd patients taking estrogens (n = 16)
compared with female pd patients not taking estrogens (n = 56) (p < 0.005). 14 this accords with the results of the study by laine et al, 65 who found that
estrogens had an inhibitory effect on the metabolism of
tacrine, another cyp1a2 substrate. there is also a
case report of an increase from a previously stable international normalized ratio for warfarin when  xxxd3145xxx  was added to the warfarin regimen. 66
because of  xxxd3145xxx 's extensive metabolism via
cyp3a4 and cyp1a2, its metabolism is potentially
inducible by several common substances, including st.
john's wort (cyp1a2, cyp3a4). 45 the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3145xxx  have been shown to be linear up to
12 mg/d, which is half the therapeutic dosing range
for pd. according to the summary of product characteristics, 63 use of  xxxd3145xxx  is contraindicated in patients with a creatinine clearance <30 ml/min. dose
adjustment of  xxxd3145xxx  may be necessary when introducing or discontinuing a potent cyp1a2 inhibitor.

discussion
receptor profiles
the lack of clinical studies powered to compare das
with respect to efficacy and aes, as well as the high incidence of aes in the l-dopa and/or placebo arms as
well as the da group, 3-5,39,46,49,59,63 make it difficult to
link the receptor profiles of individual das with their
effects on motor symptoms. one exception is dyskinevolume 28 number 8

t. kvernmo

sia, as some of the data support an increased risk for
dyskinesia as a result of dl-receptor stimulation. fici et
a134 used primary cerebellar granule cell cultures from
7-day-old sprague-dawley rats as a model for measuring dl-receptor-mediated changes in cellular cyclic
 xxxd81xxx  (camp). they reported that
nonselective da-receptor compounds such as pergolide
(p < 0.01), dopamine (p < 0.01), and bromocriptine
(p < 0.05) increased camp formation, whereas the d 3selective compound pramipexole slightly decreased camp
formation and the d2-selective compound u-95666a
had no significant effect on camp formation. the intrinsic activity of da and pergolide was 100%, whereas that of bromocriptine was 20%.
dyskinesia may be linked to stimulation of the d 1
receptor, for which the ergot-derived das cabergoline
and pergolide have a similar and relatively high affinity. clinical studies have reported a lower risk for
dyskinesias with bromocriptine and the non-ergotderived das pramipexole and  xxxd3145xxx . 3<47
an increased risk for vhd is becoming recognized
as a class effect of ergot-derived das. 28 this is consistent with reports of valvular lesions similar to those associated with ergot alkaloids such as ergotamine and
 xxxd2621xxx , n which, like the ergot-derived das,
have a high affinity for the  xxxg1114xxx . 28 a potential role for the 5-ht receptor is supported by the correlation between high 5-ht levels and valvular lesions
in patients with carcinoid heart disease, n the suggested mechanism for vhd and pulmonary hypertension
is stimulation of 5-ht2b, 10,28 which has recently been
reported to induce fibroblast mitogenesis. 28 this
mechanism, which links all da-related fibrotic disorders to stimulation of the  xxxg1114xxx , may also be
the result of stimulation of the  xxxg1113xxx . 32
a recent study comparing ergot-derived das, nonergot-derived das, and age-matched controls with respect to the occurrence of grade 2 or 3 vr found a significantly higher incidence of vr with the ergot-derived
das compared with non-ergot-derived das (31%47% vs 10%, respectively; p = 0.009 for cabergoline;
p = 0.031 for pergolide) and compared with controls
(13%; p = 0.013 for cabergoline; p = 0.004 for pergolide). 29 there was no significant difference between the
control group (13%) and the group treated with
non-ergot-derived das (10%) (figure). these results
are consistent with those of baseman et al, n who found
a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of valve abnormalities in
pergolide-treated patients compared with controls.
august 2006

et

al.

fibrotic reactions have been reported in up to 20%
of patients treated with ergot-derived das. 39,46,49 this
is in contrast to the findings for pramipexole and  xxxd3145xxx , which have no affinity for 5-ht receptors.
nonetheless, there have been 7 cases of fibrotic syndromes in patients treated with  xxxd3145xxx  (4 pleural
effusion, 2 pericardial effusion, 1 pericarditis). 32 the
currently available safety data for pramipexole do not
suggest a causal relationship between use of pramipexole and the occurrence of fibrotic reactions.
the vhd and pulmonary and retroperitoneal fibrosis seen with long-term use appear to represent a
class effect of the ergot-derived das (bromocriptine,
cabergoline, and pergolide) that may be related to stimulation of 5-ht2b 10-12,26-29 (and possibly 5-ht2a32),
which induces fibroblast mitogenesis (of which regurgitation may be an early clinical symptom). 28 as the
incidence of vhd appears to be dose dependent, 1°,12,26,32 the risk theoretically may be increased by
concomitant administration of drugs that are inhibitors of the main metabolic pathway (cyp3a4).
d r u g - d r u g interactions

bromocriptine, cabergoline, pergolide, and  xxxd3145xxx  have the potential for drug-drug interactions mediated by the cyp enzyme system in at least 3 ways:
they may inhibit the metabolism of other drugs, 41,66
their own metabolism may be inhibited, 14,42,5°-53,58,66
or they may be induced by _>1 cyp isozyme involved
in their metabolism, with a significant decrease in
bioavailability. 18,19,43-45,62 cyp-catalyzed biotransformation is affected by numerous xenobiotics and may
be dependent on individual genetic disposition. 67
bromocriptine, cabergoline, pergolide, and  xxxd3145xxx  may interact with other drugs as a result of their
ability to inhibit cyp isozymes and thus the metabolism of other drugs. 41 there is some evidence that the
etiology of pd may be related to a lack of cyp2d6
function. 68-72 use of drugs such as pergolide and
 xxxd3145xxx , which are strong inhibitors of cyp2d6
in vitro, 41 may thus be counterproductive in some
instances.
inhibition of da metabolism may result in increased
bioavailability of the da, as has been reported in vivo for
bromocriptine, cabergoline, and  xxxd3145xxx  14,42,5°-53,58,64
and might be expected in theory for pergolide, potentially giving rise to dopaminergic aes such as hallucinations and dyskinesia. 33 furthermore, fibrosis associated
with ergot-derived das appears to be dose related and
1075

clinical therapeutics

thus plasma-concentration related. 12,26,32 although it
may not result in acute aes, even a moderate increase
in the bioavailability of ergot-derived das over time as
a result of chronic interaction with comedication may
contribute to an increased risk for aes such as fibrosis.
a recent report found a greater correlation between
vhd and high doses of pergolide in the past (r = 0.94;
p = 0.001) compared with all doses of pergolide in the
past (r = 0.478; p < 0.001). 12
based on in vivo findings for other drugs metabolized by cyp3a443,44 and/or cyp1a2, 45 it is reasonable to assume that induction of the cyp isozymes involved in da metabolism may significantly decrease
the bioavailability of the drug in question and may result in drug failure. because bromocriptine, cabergoline, pergolide, and  xxxd3145xxx  are metabolized by
cyp1a2 and/or cyp3a4, concomitant administration
of drugs that induce cyp may result in drug failure
and the possible return of parkinsonian symptoms.
several limitations of this review should be noted.
the literature search was limited to medline, and
no government agencies that monitor drug safety were
contacted. thus, the selection of publications and the
resulting conclusions may have been biased.
finally, in addition to a drug's pharmacokinetics
and receptor-binding properties, it is necessary to consider its efficacy, onset of action, tolerability, convenience, cost, quality-of-life effects, and risk-benefit
ratio when selecting a drug for an individual patient.
monitoring signs and symptoms and aes related to
treatment, as well as drug interactions, is warranted in
patients treated with das.
conclusions

dyskinesia as an ae of da therapy may be related to
dl-receptor stimulation. fibrosis (including vhd) appears to be a class effect of ergot-derived das, all of
which have been associated with confirmed valvular lesions in at least 1 study or case report. bromocriptine,
cabergoline, pergolide, and  xxxd3145xxx  have the potential for drug-drug interactions mediated through the
cyp enzyme system.
