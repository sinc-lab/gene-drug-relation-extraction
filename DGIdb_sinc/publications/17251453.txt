purpose. previous reports have shown genetic predisposition
for atopic dermatitis (ad). some of the severe complications of
ad manifest in the eye, such as cataract, retinal detachment,
and keratoconjunctivitis. this study was conducted to examine
the genetic association between the atopy-related genes and
patients with ocular complications (ocular ad).
methods. seventy-eighty patients with ocular ad and 282
healthy control subjects were enrolled in an investigation of
the association between the atopy-related genes (fcerb, il13,
and  xxxg1142xxx ) and ocular ad. genetic association studies and
functional analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps)
were performed.
results. the ⫺56tt genotype in the  xxxg1142xxx  promoter region
was significantly associated with an increased risk of ocular ad
under recessive models (␹2 test, raw p ⫽ 0.0004, odds ratio
2.57). the ⫺56tt genotype was more common in atopic
cataracts. a reporter gene assay showed that, after stimulation
with ifn-␥, the  xxxg1142xxx  gene promoter construct that contained the ⫺56t allele, a common allele in ocular ad patients,
manifested higher transcriptional activity in lens epithelial cells
(lecs) than did the construct with the ⫺56c allele. real-time

pcr analysis demonstrated higher  xxxg1142xxx  mrna expression
in the lecs in atopic than in senile cataracts. inos expression
by  xxxg1142xxx -overexpressing lecs was enhanced on stimulation
with ifn-␥ and lps.
conclusions. the ⫺56t allele in the  xxxg1142xxx  promoter results
in higher  xxxg1142xxx  transcriptional activity and represents a genetic risk factor for atopic cataracts. (invest ophthalmol vis
sci. 2007;48:583–589) doi:10.1167/iovs.06-0991

a

topic dermatitis (ad) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. in the acute stage, there is local infiltration by
t-helper type 2 (th2) cells; the subsequent infiltration by
t-helper type 1 (th1) cells produces chronic ad lesions.1
genetic epidemiologic studies on monozygotic twins2 and
genetic association studies3,4 suggested a genetic susceptibility
for ad. because the severe complications of ad manifest in the
eye as keratoconjunctivitis,5 retinal detachment,6 cataract,7
and keratoconus, it is important to identify the genetic risk
factors for ocular ad. our group previously reported several
atopy-related genes including high-affinity ige receptor beta
(fcerb),8 interleukin 13 (il-13),9 and  xxxg1141xxx  receptor ( xxxg1142xxx ),10 and elucidated their functional roles. in the
present study, we genotyped these candidate genes and compared the results in patients with ad with and without ocular
ad and normal control subjects. as we found a strong association between the ⫺56c/t single nucleotide polymorphism
(snp) in the promoter region of  xxxg1142xxx  and ocular ad, we
further investigated the role of this snp.  xxxg1142xxx  comprises the
two transmembrane subunits  xxxg1142xxx  and  xxxg1143xxx .  xxxg1142xxx  is
encoded by a 30-kb gene (chromosome 6) consisting of 7
exons,11 and its expression is essential for ligand binding and
signaling through  xxxg1219xxx  and stat1;  xxxg1143xxx  transduces ifn-␥
( xxxg1141xxx ) signals through jak2.11,12 reduced  xxxg1142xxx  expression
results in diminished  xxxg1219xxx /jak2/stat1 signaling,13 and the
expression of  xxxg1142xxx  is downregulated by mycobacterium
infections14 and the tlr2 ligand13—factors known to counteract atopic diseases.15,16 there is growing evidence of a role for
 xxxg1141xxx  in the effector phase of chronic  xxxg178xxx  and allergic conjunctivitis.17 furthermore, overexpression of the  xxxg1141xxx  gene in
mouse epidermis produces eczema-like phenotypes,18 and its
overexpression in the lens induces cataracts in transgenic
mice.19 we found that among patients with ocular ad, in those
with atopic cataracts, there was a strong genetic association
with the  xxxg1142xxx  ⫺56c/t snp. because the snps that placed
individuals at high risk for ocular ad manifested higher
 xxxg1142xxx  promoter activity in lens epithelial cells (lecs), we
investigated the  xxxg1142xxx  mrna levels in lecs obtained at
cataract surgery.

methods

antibodies and cell lines
we purchased anti-human major histocompatibility complex (mhc)
class ii antibody from dako japan (kyoto, japan) and alexa-488 goat
anti-mouse igg antibody from invitrogen japan (tokyo, japan). human
immortalized lecs (sra01/04), obtained from riken cell bank
(tsukuba, japan),20 were maintained with 10% fetal bovine serum
(fbs) in minimum essential medium (mem, invitrogen).

subjects
in all patients with ad, the disease was diagnosed according to the
criteria of hanifin and rajka.21 peripheral blood was obtained from 78
patients with (table 1) and 186 without ocular ad.4 the patients were
recruited at juntendo university hospital, yamaguchi university hospital, takao hospital, kyoto prefectural university hospital, japan red
cross society nagoya 2nd hospital, hokkaido university hospital, and
yokohama city university hospital. atopic keratoconjunctivitis (akc)
was diagnosed according to the criteria of the japanese ophthalmological society, and atopic cataracts were detected by slit lamp examination. the control subjects were 282 randomly selected, populationbased individuals 19 to 68 years of age (mean, 38.21) with no atopyrelated diseases. all study subjects were ethnic japanese. according to
the rules of the process committee at snp research center of riken,
written informed consent was obtained from all participants; parental
consent was obtained for individuals younger than 16 years. the study
was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the declaration of
helsinki.

screening for genetic polymorphisms
genetic polymorphisms screening was carried out essentially as previously described.3,4 the  xxxg1142xxx  genomic region targeted for snp
discovery included a 2.5-kb continuous region 5⬘ to exon 1 (promoter
region) and 11 exons, each with a minimum of 200 bases of flanking
intronic sequences. we designed primer sets on the  xxxg1142xxx  genomic
sequence (genbank: al050337; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank; provided in the public domain by the national center for bio-

technology information, bethesda, md). each polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was performed with 5 ng of genomic dna from 24
individuals (12 patients with ad and 12 control subjects). sequence
reactions were performed (big dye terminator ver. 3.1 using a 3700
dna analyzer; applied biosystems [abi], foster city, ca).

genotyping
initial screening genotyping of snps in the  xxxg1446xxx , il13, and  xxxg1142xxx 
gene regions has been described.9,10,22 we further genotyped the
 xxxg1142xxx  gene by allele frequency (minor allele frequency [maf]
⬎10%) and based on intragenic linkage disequilibrium (ld) information. we genotyped the snps either with the invader assay,23 by
pcr-rflp, direct sequencing, or with a genotyping assay (taqman;
abi). an invader assay was performed with multiplex pcr products as
the template. genotyping was performed on a sequence-detection
system (prism 7700; abi), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

statistical analysis
statistical analysis was carried out essentially as previously described.4
allele frequencies in patients with ad and the control subjects were
compared by the contingency ␹2 test. p ⬍ 0.01 (also in the case of
multiple comparisons after bonferroni adjustment) was considered to
be statistically significant. odds ratio (or) and 95% confidence interval
(ci) were also calculated.
reporter gene assay. reporter gene assay was carried out
essentially as previously described.4 a pair of 753-base  xxxg1142xxx  promoter sequences was subcloned continuous to exon 1 into  xxxg2041xxx  basic
vector (promega corp., madison, wi). two clones were made; the first
was ⫺611g, ⫺56c, and the second was ⫺611g, ⫺56t. after all
subcloned plasmids were verified by direct sequencing,  xxxg2041xxx - xxxg1142xxx 
promoter plasmids and prl-tk (as an internal control for transfection
efficiency) were transfected into immortalized human lecs (lipofectamine 2000; invitrogen). the medium was changed 24 hours later,
and the lecs were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (lps, 1 ␮g/ml,
l4391; sigma-aldrich) or recombinant human ifn-␥ (1000 u/ml, r&d
systems). luciferase activity was measured with a dual luciferase reporter assay kit (promega) at 36 hours after transfection.

 xxxg1142xxx  overexpression in lecs

results

full length human  xxxg1142xxx  cdna was generated by pcr and then
subcloned into pcdna-v5-his vectors (invitrogen), and the sequence
was verified by direct sequences. lecs in six-well culture plates were
transfected with 500 ng of the plasmid/well, using 1 ␮l of transfection
reagent (lipofectamine 2000; invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. twenty-four hours later, the culture medium was
changed; the cells were stimulated with 1 ␮g/ml lps and 1000 u/ml
human ifn-␥. twelve hours after stimulation, they were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs). total rna was extracted with an rna isolation kit (nucleospin ii; macherey-nagel,
duren, germany), and cdnas were prepared using random primers
and the reverse transcriptase (revertra ace; both from toyobo, osaka,
japan) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

genotyping of the candidate genes

reverse transcription and real-time
pcr analysis
reverse-transcription (rt) and real-time pcr analysis was carried out
essentially as previously described.24 anterior capsules, obtained at
cataract surgery with written informed consent, were immediately
stored in stabilizer (rnalater reagent; ambion, austin, tx) to protect
the rna. the procedure was approved by the ethics committees of
kyoto prefectural university of medicine. total rna was isolated with
the (micro rna extraction kit; qiagen japan, tokyo) from the anterior
capsules or lecs, and then cdna was prepared as described earlier.
we used real-time pcr probes and primers specific for human  xxxg1142xxx ,
 xxxg1578xxx  (inos), and  xxxg861xxx  (assay-on-demand
gene expression products; abi). real-time pcr analysis was performed
on a sequence-detection system (prism 7300; abi). the relative expression of  xxxg1142xxx  in lecs was quantified by the standard curve method
using  xxxg861xxx  expression in the same cdna as the control.

immunohistochemistry
lens capsules obtained at cataract surgery were frozen in oct compound, cryostat sections were cut, mounted on slides, and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde in pbs. nonspecific staining was blocked (30 minutes) with blocking buffer (10% normal goat serum, and 1% bovine
 xxxg124xxx  [bsa] in pbs). anti-mhc class ii monoclonal antibody
(1:200 dilution) was then applied and incubated overnight at 4°c. after
they were washed with pbs, the slides were incubated for 30 minutes
with alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse igg. the slides were inspected
under a confocal microscope (leica, tokyo, japan).

first, we screened for snps in the  xxxg1446xxx , il13, and  xxxg1142xxx 
gene regions. although we observed no associations between
the snps in the  xxxg1446xxx  and il13 regions (table 2), there was
a statistically significant association between the ⫺56c/t snp
in the  xxxg1142xxx  region and ocular ad (p ⫽ 0.0004).

snp discovery and case–control association
study in the  xxxg1142xxx  region
our genotyping of the candidate genes prompted the additional screening for other snps in the  xxxg1142xxx  region. as
shown in table 3, we detected 19 snps. their position is
numbered relative to their position in the published  xxxg1142xxx 
gene sequence (genbank: al050337). position 1 is the adenine

of the first methionine. among the 19 snps, there were five
common snps with maf greater than 10%. we selected snp 3
(⫺611g/a) and snp 5 (⫺56c/t) in the promoter region and
snp 13 (20685 a/g) in intron 6, as tag snps because of
intragenic pair-wise ld expressed as r2 (table 4). snp
206856a/c (no. 13) did not show an association with ocular
ad, snp ⫺611g/a (no. 3) exhibited marginal association not
stronger than snp –56c/t (no. 5). therefore, we focused on
snp ⫺56c/t. there was a significant association between the
⫺56c/t snp and ocular ad (raw p ⫽ 0.0004, or ⫽ 2.57, 95%
ci ⫽ 1.51– 4.39), the association became stronger for the
atopic cataracts (raw p ⫽ 0.000024, or ⫽ 3.70, 95% ci ⫽ 1.96
to 6.97; table 5). all the genotype frequencies of the snps
were concordant with hardy-weinberg equilibrium.

haplotype analysis of  xxxg1142xxx  (ⴚ611/ⴚ56) snps
we also tested the distribution of two-locus haplotypes in ad
and control samples (table 6). among the two-locus haplotypes of snps in the promoter region (⫺611g/a and ⫺56t/c),
the ⫺611g/⫺56c haplotype showed decreased risk for ocular
ad (g-c versus others; p ⫽ 0.00,003, or ⫽ 2.26). the  xxxg1142xxx 
haplotype ⫺611g/⫺56c showed decreased risk for atopic
cataracts (g-c versus others; p ⫽ 0.000003, or ⫽ 3.16), to a
degree that was greater than that of single snp genotype
association (⫺56tt versus others, p ⫽ 0.00002).

reporter gene analysis
using  xxxg2041xxx -basic vector, we prepared a construct for ⫺611g/
⫺56c, the major haplotype, and for ⫺611g/⫺56t, the common haplotype among patients with ad. the primers used for
subcloning were 5⬘-aggtgagatcattagacatt-3⬘ (forward) and 5⬘gctgctaccgacggtcgctggct-3⬘ (reverse). all assays were performed in triplicate. in figure 1, a representative result of three
independent experiments is shown as the mean ⫾ sd. in the
absence of stimulation, luciferase activity was not significantly
different between ⫺56c/t snps containing constructs in the
lecs. the genotype ⫺56t containing construct induced stronger  xxxg1142xxx  promoter activity than the ⫺56c construct when

0.02, respectively, by student’s t-test).

 xxxg1142xxx  overexpression experiment in lecs
lecs transfected with an  xxxg1142xxx  expression plasmid showed
approximately a fivefold increase in  xxxg1142xxx  expression (fig. 2,
left). inos mrna expression was only observed in cells stimulated with  xxxg1141xxx ⫹lps. inos gene expression was upregulated
approximately threefold in  xxxg1142xxx -overexpressing lecs compared with mock-transfected lecs (fig. 2, right).

real-time pcr analysis
cdnas were synthesized from total rna isolated from the
anterior lens capsules of patients undergoing surgery for atopic
(n ⫽ 5) and senile cataracts (n ⫽ 5). the expression of  xxxg1142xxx 
mrna was significantly higher in the atopic than the senile
cataracts (fig. 3, p ⫽ 0.00005 by mann-whitney’s u-test).

anti-mhc class ii immunostaining of
lens epithelium
anti-mhc class ii immunohistochemistry was performed on
senile and atopic cataract lens capsules. lecs in atopic but not
in senile cataracts were positive for mhc class ii immunostaining (fig. 4).

discussion
although nishimura et al.25 reported genetic linkage in allergic
conjunctivitis, ours is the first genetic association study of
ocular ad, which tends to be more severe and longer lasting
than allergic conjunctivitis without ad. initial genotyping
screening showed that atopy- or ad-related genes did not
necessarily show an association with ocular ad. among our
candidate snps, we found a strong genetic association between the  xxxg1142xxx  ⫺56c/t snp and ocular ad. we previously
reported an association between  xxxg1142xxx  snps and the serum
ige concentration in patients with atopic asthma.10 herein, we

 xxxg1141xxx  transgenic mice,19 and  xxxg1141xxx  treatment of lecs induced
apoptosis,28 one of the pathologic features of atopic cataracts.29 using a reporter gene assay, we first examined the
effect of the ⫺56c/t snp in human immortalized lecs.20 we
made 753-bp  xxxg1142xxx  promoter region constructs to analyze
the ⫺611g/⫺56c and ⫺611g/⫺56t haplotypes, because
these two major haplotypes make up more than 90% of all
haplotypes (table 5). after lec stimulation with  xxxg1141xxx  and lps,
we found significantly higher transcriptional activity in the
presence of the ⫺56t allele, the risk allele for atopic cataracts,
than the ⫺56c allele (fig. 1). this result is consistent with the
findings of juliger et al.,30 whose reporter gene assay showed
a higher level of  xxxg1142xxx  transcriptional activity with the ⫺56t
allele, and is well matched to our haplotype association study
which showed that ⫺611g/⫺56c is a protective and ⫺611g/
⫺56t is a risk haplotype for ocular ad induction (table 5). in
our experiments, we used lps/ xxxg1141xxx  stimulation because lps/

document that the association between the snps and ocular
ad was stronger than in the previous study. as surprisingly,
there was no association between snp and ad without ocular
complications (table 4), we postulated that in addition to its
effect on serum ige, the  xxxg1142xxx  gene plays some role as an
organ-specific susceptibility gene for ocular ad. in african
populations, there is a genetic associations between the
 xxxg1142xxx  ⫺56c/t snp and helicobacter pylori infection,26 and
cerebral malaria27; the ⫺56t genotype was associated with
higher serum h. pylori antibody concentrations, and ⫺56c/t
heterozygosity was protective against cerebral malaria infection. these results suggest that the ⫺56c/t snp plays some
functional role(s) not only in the japanese, but also in the
african population.
we examined the association between atopic cataracts and
the  xxxg1142xxx  snp, because cataract formation was observed in

pression may be a predisposing factor for atopic cataracts. we
are in the process of measuring  xxxg1141xxx  concentration in aqueous
humor samples from patients with atopic and senile cataracts.
although topical steroids are frequently used to treat ocular
atopic conditions, they are causative reagents for cataracts.36
therefore, treatment of ocular ad with inhibitors of t-cell
activation (e.g., cyclosporine and tacrolimus) or with nos
inhibitors may be more successful in preventing  xxxg1141xxx -mediated atopic cataract formation. our findings identified a genetic
risk factor for ocular complications in patients with ad. we are
planning additional genotyping and functional studies on other
candidate genes and are investigating antiapoptotic molecules
bcl-229 and major basic protein.37 the roles of glutathione
should also be investigated because of a possible relationship
with subcapsular cataracts.38

 xxxg1141xxx  treatment of lecs induced inos expression,31 a known
cataract-inducing factor.32 as a downstream signal of  xxxg1141xxx ,
inos has been intensively studied in macrophages,33 and in
airway34 and lens epithelium.31 to clarify the role of  xxxg1142xxx  in
the induction of inos in lecs, we transfected lecs with
 xxxg1142xxx  and stimulated them with  xxxg1141xxx ⫹lps. cells that overexpressed  xxxg1142xxx  generated higher amounts of inos mrna
(fig. 2), a finding consistent with that reported by li et al.31 as
the nos inhibitor could prevent the development of cataracts
in selenite-treated rats,32 inos expression may play a role in
the genesis of cataracts.
furthermore, lecs from atopic cataracts manifested higher
 xxxg1142xxx  mrna expression than did lecs from senile cataracts
(fig. 3), and lecs from atopic cataracts were positive for mhc
class ii staining (fig. 4). our results are consistent with those of
egwuagu et al.,35 who showed that ectopic mhc class ii
expression due to  xxxg1141xxx  overexpression resulted in ocular
disease including cataract formation. based on these considerations, we postulate that  xxxg1141xxx - xxxg1142xxx  signals are active in the
development of atopic cataracts and that higher  xxxg1142xxx  ex-
