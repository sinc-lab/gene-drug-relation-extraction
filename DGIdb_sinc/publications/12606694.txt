opioid compounds and peptides act on opioid receptors to
exert their pharmacological and physiological functions. opioid receptors were classified into at least three types, ␮, ␦,
and ␬, based on pharmacological and anatomical analyses
(for reviews, see chang, 1984; mansour et al., 1988). subsequently, ␮, ␦, and ␬ opioid receptors were cloned, and these
receptors belong to the rhodopsin subfamily of the g proteincoupled receptor (gpcr) family (for reviews, see kieffer,
1995; knapp et al., 1995). opioid receptors are coupled
through pertussis toxin-sensitive g proteins to affect a variety of effectors, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase,
increase in potassium conductance, decrease in calcium conthis work was supported by national institutes of health grants da

and u50,488h-induced internalization in a dose-dependent manner. immunofluorescence staining of flag-hkor yielded similar
results. dynorphin a(1-17) and u50,488h enhanced phosphorylation of flag-hkor to a greater extent than  xxxd2070xxx , but levorphanol did not increase flag-hkor phosphorylation.  xxxd2070xxx  or
levorphanol decreased dynorphin- or u50,488h-induced phosphorylation. it is likely that conformations of the hkor required for
phosphorylation and initiation of internalization are different from
those for activation of g proteins. we also examined whether the
four agonists had differential effects on superactivation of adenylate cyclase. pretreatment with u50,488h, dynorphin a(1-17), or
 xxxd2070xxx  enhanced  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylate cyclase activity to ⬃200 to 250% of the control, whereas levorphanol pretreatment did not result in significant adenylate cyclase superactivation. thus, the degree of superactivation caused by an agonist is
unrelated to its ability to promote internalization of the hkor.

activation of ␬ opioid receptors produces many effects including analgesia (von voigtlander et al., 1983; dykstra et al.,
1987), dysphoria (pfeiffer et al., 1986; dykstra et al., 1987),
and water diuresis (von voigtlander et al., 1983; dykstra et
al., 1987).
most gpcrs show attenuated responsiveness to agonists
after prolonged or repeated activation. three distinct processes have been characterized: desensitization (seconds to
hours), internalization (minutes to hours) and down-regulation (hours to days) (tsao et al., 2001; pierce et al., 2002).
activation of the receptor, in addition to initiating signal
transduction, enhances phosphorylation of the receptor in
intracellular domains, mostly by  xxxg676xxx   xxxg1336xxx

abstract
we previously observed that (trans)-3,4-dichloro-n-methyln-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl]benzeneacetamide (u50,488h)
promoted internalization and phosphorylation of the flag-tagged
human ␬ opioid receptor (flag-hkor) stably expressed in chinese
hamster ovary (cho) cells. in this study, we compared regulation
of the flag-hkor expressed in cho cells by u50,488h, dynorphin a,  xxxd2070xxx , and levorphanol, which were potent full agonists as determined by stimulation of guanosine 5⬘-o-(3[35s]thio)triphosphate binding. using fluorescence flow cytometry,
we found that dynorphin a(1-17), like u50,488h, promoted internalization of the flag-hkor in a time- and dose-dependent manner. the antagonists naloxone and norbinaltorphimine, having no
effect on flag-hkor internalization, effectively blocked dynorphin
a(1-17)- and u50,488h-induced internalization. interestingly, the
full agonists  xxxd2070xxx  and levorphanol did not cause internalization of the flag-hkor but significantly reduced dynorphin a(1-17)-

stable transfection of cho and hek 293 cell lines with
the human ␬ opioid receptor and cell culture. flag-tagged
human ␬ opioid receptor (flag-hkor) in the expression vector
pcdna3 was generated previously (li et al., 2002). clonal cho cell
lines stably expressing flag-hkor (cho-flag-hkor) were established previously (li et al., 2002). hek 293 cells stably expressing
flag-hkor (hek-flag-hkor) were established according to our
35

published methods (zhu et al., 1997). cells were cultured in 100-mm
culture dishes in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium-ham’s f-12
medium (for cho-flag-hkor) or minimum essential medium (for
hek-flag-hkor) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.2
mg/ml  xxxd2191xxx , 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin
in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5% co2 and 95% air at
37°c.
␬ opioid receptor binding. receptor binding was conducted
with [3h] xxxd1913xxx  in 50 mm tris-hcl buffer containing 1 mm
ethylene glycol-bis-(␤-aminoethyl ether)-n,n,n⬘,n⬘-tetraacetic acid
and 5 ␮m leupeptin (ph 7.4), as described previously (li et al., 2002).
naloxone (10 ␮m) was used to define nonspecific binding. saturation
experiments were performed with various concentrations of [3h] xxxd1913xxx  (ranging from 0.02 nm to 2 nm). competitive inhibition
of [3h] xxxd1913xxx  binding was performed with [3h] xxxd1913xxx 
at a concentration close to its kd (⬃0.2 nm) and various concentrations of (⫺)-u50,488h, dynorphin a(1-17),  xxxd2070xxx , or levorphanol.
binding was conducted at 25°c for 60 min in duplicate in a volume
of 1 ml with 30 to 40 ␮g of protein. bound and free ligands were
separated by rapid filtration under reduced pressure over gf/b
filters presoaked with 0.2% polyethyleneimine and 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  in 50 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.4) for 1 h. binding data were
analyzed with ebda and ligand programs.
[35s]gtp␥s binding assay. membrane preparation and the
[35s]gtp␥s binding assay were performed as described previously
(huang et al., 2001). cells were washed twice and harvested in
versene solution (0.54 mm edta, 140 mm nacl, 2.7 mm kcl, 8.1
mm na2hpo4, 1.46 mm kh2po4, and 1 mm glucose) and centrifuged at 500g for 3 min. the cell pellet was suspended in buffer a (5
mm tris, ph 7.4, 5 mm edta, 5 mm ethylene glycol-bis-(␤-aminoethyl ether)-n,n,n⬘,n⬘-tetraacetic acid, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), passed through a 26g3/8 needle five times, and
then centrifuged at 46,000g for 30 min. the pellet was resuspended
in buffer a and centrifuged again. the membrane pellet was resuspended in buffer b (50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.0, 0.32 mm sucrose),
aliquoted at about 600 ␮g/ml, frozen in dry ice/ethanol, and stored at
⫺80°c. all procedures were performed at 4°c.
prior to assay, membranes were thawed at 37°c, chilled on ice,
passed through a 22-gauge needle, and diluted with buffer c (50 mm
hepes, 100 mm nacl, 5 mm mgcl2, and 1 mm edta with 0.1%
bovine  xxxg124xxx  freshly added, ph 7.4). membranes (10 –20 ␮g
of protein) were incubated in buffer c containing [35s]gtp␥s
(100,000 –150,000 dpm, ⬃80 pm), gdp (3 ␮m), and varying concentrations of the ␬ opioid agonist u50,488h (10⫺10 to 10⫺6 m), dynorphin a(1-17) (10⫺11 to 10⫺7 m),  xxxd2070xxx  (10⫺11 to 10⫺7 m), or
levorphanol (10⫺9 to 10⫺5 m) in a total volume of 0.5 ml for 60 min
at 30°c. nonspecific binding was defined by incubation in the presence of 10 ␮m gtp␥s. bound and free [35s]gtp␥s were separated by
filtration through gf/b filters under reduced pressure. radioactivity
on filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. ec50 and
maximal response values were calculated by use of the equation, y ⫽
[emax/[1 ⫹ (x/ec50)s]] ⫹ background, in which y is the response at the
dose x, emax is the maximal response, and s is a slope factor.
phosphorylation of the ␬ opioid receptors. phosphorylation
was conducted according to a procedure modified from that of li et al.
(2002). cho-flag-hkor cells were transferred from 100-mm dishes
into six-well plates and cultured overnight to confluence. cells were
then grown in 1 ml/well phosphate-free medium at 37°c for 2 h.
[32p]orthophosphate (0.25 mci/well) was added and incubated for
another 2 h, and medium was aspirated. cells were incubated with
1 ␮m (⫺)-u50,488h, 0.1 ␮m dynorphin a(1-17), 1 ␮m  xxxd2070xxx , or
10 ␮m levorphanol for 30 min at 37°c, cooled on ice, and washed
three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. all subsequent
steps were carried out at 4°c. cells were solubilized for 1 h with
solubilization buffer [1% triton x-100, 50 mm tris hcl, 150 mm
nacl, 1 mm edta, 20 nm  xxxd411xxx , and 10% complete protease
inhibitor cocktail from roche diagnostics (indianapolis, in), ph7.5],

binding of arrestins, which uncouple the receptor from g
proteins, causing desensitization. arrestins also act as
adapter proteins binding clathrin and adapter protein-2,
which results in internalization of the receptor. more prolonged activation leads to degradation of the receptor in
lysosomes, proteasomes, or membranes, resulting in a reduction of the receptor number, which is termed down-regulation.
we demonstrated previously that u50,488h enhanced
phosphorylation of the human ␬ opioid receptor (hkor) expressed in chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells, which was
mediated by grks (li et al., 2002). using a receptor binding
technique, we found that the hkor underwent u50,488hinduced internalization via a grk-, ␤-arrestin-, and dynamin-dependent process that likely involved clathrincoated vesicles (li et al., 1999; zhang et al., 2002). in
addition,  xxxg970xxx  or  xxxg971xxx  that was co-internalized with the
hkor and g protein ␤␥ subunits played a critical role for
internalization of the hkor (schulz et al., 2002). however,
unlike u50,488h,  xxxd2070xxx  did not promote internalization
of the hkor (li et al., 1999). since receptor binding was
employed to detect internalized receptors in these studies, we
could not examine whether endogenous dynorphin peptides
caused internalization because it is difficult to remove these
peptides, due to their sticky nature.
in this study, we employed fluorescence flow cytometry
and immunofluorescence staining to compare internalization
of flag-tagged hkor (flag-hkor) induced by dynorphin
a(1-17), u50,488h,  xxxd2070xxx , and levorphanol and their
combinations. in addition, effects of the four agonists and
their combinations on phosphorylation of flag-hkor were
examined. moreover, we addressed the question whether a
compensatory increase in adenylate cyclase activities following agonist pretreatment was related to receptor internalization.

determination of camp level. cho-flag-hkor cells were
cultured in 12-well culture plates overnight before experiments. for
agonist pretreatment, cells were incubated at 37°c for 4 h with 1 ␮m
(⫺)-u50,488h, 0.1 ␮m dynorphin a(1-17), 1 ␮m  xxxd2070xxx , or 10 ␮m
levorphanol. after treatment, medium was removed and cells were
washed three times with prewarmed (37°c) 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline.  xxxd2388xxx  (1 mm) in prewarmed (37°c)
opti-mem i reduced serum medium was added at 0.5 ml/well and
incubated for 10 min at 37°c followed by naloxone  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m (final
concentration) for another 10 min. cells were then incubated with 10
␮⌴  xxxd1742xxx  for 10 min at 37°c, and the reaction was terminated by
placing the plates in boiling water for 10 min. the contents of each
well were collected and frozen at ⫺80°c. on the day of camp determination, the samples were thawed on ice and sonicated. camp
contents in each sample were determined with the camp binding
protein method described by huang et al. (2001). [3h]camp
(⬃250,000 dpm in 0.02 m citrate phosphate buffer, ph 5.0) was
added on ice to all sample tubes and tubes containing known
amounts of camp (from 1.25 to 40 pmol) for generation of a standard
curve. camp binding protein partially purified from bovine adrenal
glands was added to each tube, except the blanks, at an amount
which gave 10,000 to 20,000 dpm of [3h]camp binding in the absence
of cold camp. the mixture (final volume 170 ␮l) was incubated 2 h to
overnight at 4°c. bound and free [3h]camp were separated by
adsorption of free [3h]camp by 100 ␮l of charcoal suspension (10%
norit a charcoal, 4% bovine  xxxg124xxx , 1% antifoam a) and
centrifugation (1,500g for 20 min). radioactivity of bound [3h]camp
in an aliquot of the supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting. the standard curve was analyzed with a logit-log
equation and the kaleidagraph 3.5 program (synergy software,
inc., reading, pa). the amounts of camp in samples were calculated
based on the standard curve and converted to picomoles per well.
statistical analysis. for comparison of multiple groups, data
were analyzed with analysis of variance to determine whether there
were significant differences among groups using prism 3.0 (graphpad software, inc., san diego, ca). if so, dunnett’s post hoc test was
performed to determine whether there was a significant difference
between the control and each treatment group. for comparison of
two groups, student’s t test was performed. p ⬍ 0.05 was the level of
significance in all statistical analyses.

results
dynorphin a(1-17),  xxxd2070xxx , u50,488h, and levorphanol were potent full agonists for the hkor. binding
affinity of dynorphin a(1-17),  xxxd2070xxx , u50,488h, and
levorphanol for the hkor, and their potency and efficacy in
stimulating [35s]gtp␥s binding were determined. dynorphin a(1-17),  xxxd2070xxx , u50,488h, and levorphanol inhibited [3h] xxxd1913xxx  binding to the hkor with high affinity,
with ki values in the nanomolar or subnanomolar range
(table 1). we have shown previously that binding performed
in  xxxd3449xxx  and in [35s]gtp␥s binding buffer yields similar
ki values for agonists for the ␬ opioid receptor (zhu et al.,
1997). all four were potent full agonists in enhancing
[35s]gtp␥s binding, with ec50 values in the range of 0.14 to
17.9 nm (table 1). both the affinity and potency were in the
order of dynorphin a(1-17) ⬎  xxxd2070xxx  ⬎ u50,488h ⬎ levorphanol. when a single concentration was used in some experiments, the concentration was 400- to 700-fold of its ec50
value unless specified otherwise.

hkor was performed with rabbit anti-flag polyclonal antibody followed by pansorbin (final dilution 1:20, 4°c, 1 h) according to our
published procedure (li et al., 2002). the mixture was centrifuged
and the pellets were washed three times by centrifugation and resuspension. immunoprecipitated materials were dissolved in 2⫻
lammeli sample buffer and subjected to 8% sds-polyacrylamide gel

quantitation of receptor internalization by fluorescence
flow cytometry. a fluorescence flow cytometry assay was performed according to a modification of a procedure described by gage

in six-well plates were left untreated or were treated for 30 min at
37°c with u50,488h, dynorphin a(1-17),  xxxd2070xxx , or levorphanol
at indicated concentrations. in some experiments, cells were pretreated with 10 ␮m naloxone, 0.1 ␮m nor-bni, 0.1 ␮m  xxxd2070xxx  or
10 ␮m levorphanol for 10 min before treatment with u50,488h or
dynorphin a(1-17). cells were washed three times with ice-cold
buffer a (58 mm na2hpo4, 17 mm nah2po4, and 68 mm nacl) and
lifted with buffer a containing 0.5 mm edta. cells were incubated
with m1 anti-flag antibody (1 ␮g/ml) in 500 ␮l of opti-mem i
reduced serum medium containing 1 mm cacl2 for 45 min at 4°c.
after three washes with buffer a, cells were incubated with alexa
fluo 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg (1 ␮g/ml) in 500 ␮l of
opti-mem i reduced serum medium containing 1 mm cacl2 for 45
min at 4°c. cells were washed three times with ice-cold buffer a and
then resuspended with 300 ␮l of buffer a. immunoreactivity of
surface receptor was quantitated by fluorescence flow cytometry
(facscan; bd biosciences, san jose, ca). fluorescence intensity of
10,000 cells was collected for each sample. cellquest software (bd
biosciences) was used to calculate the mean fluorescence intensity of
single cells in each population. the mean fluorescence of cells stained
only with alexa fluo 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg was also
determined and subtracted from each sample. internalized receptors
were calculated according to the following equation: internalized

alexa fluo 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg, enhanced
fluorescence level was detected using fluorescence flow cytometry, whereas the untransfected cells displayed little fluorescence. dynorphin a(1-17) (0.1 ␮m) caused internalization of the receptor in a time-dependent manner, reaching a
plateau at 30 min, similar to u50,488h (1 ␮m) (fig. 1). at the
plateau, 30 to 40% of the receptors were internalized, and the
extents of internalization achieved by dynorphin a(1-17) and
u50,488h did not differ significantly. pretreatment for 2 h
with monensin (50 ␮m), a sodium ionophore which prevents
acidification of intracellular vesicles and blocks the recycling
of internalized receptors (pippig et al., 1995), did not affect

immunofluorescence of cell surface ␬ receptors, indicating
that during the 30-min incubation period, there is no significant recycling of the receptor. a 30-min incubation was used
in subsequent experiments. in contrast to dynorphin a(1-17)
and u50,488h,  xxxd2070xxx  (10⫺11, 10⫺10, 10⫺9, 10⫺8, 10⫺7,
and 10⫺6 m) and levorphanol (10⫺6 or 10⫺5 m) did not induce
internalization of flag-hkor (fig. 2, 10⫺6 m  xxxd2070xxx  and
10⫺5 m levorphanol only). pretreatment with monensin did
not affect surface receptor immunofluorescence following
 xxxd2070xxx  or levorphanol treatment (data not shown). thus,
the lack of internalization by either drug is not the result of
rapid recycling of internalized receptor. these results indicate that there are differences among agonists in promoting
internalization of flag-hkor. naloxone or nor-bni, which
itself did not affect internalization, blocked dynorphin a(117)- or u50,488h-induced internalization (fig. 2).
 xxxd2070xxx  or levorphanol reduced dynorphin a(117)- or u50,488h-induced internalization. whether  xxxd2070xxx  or levorphanol had any effect on dynorphin a(1-17)- or
u50,488h-induced internalization of flag-hkor was examined.  xxxd2070xxx  (0.1 and 1 ␮m) or levorphanol [1 and 10 ␮m
for u50,488h, 10 ␮m for dynorphin a(1-17)] significantly
reduced dynorphin a(1-17)- or u50,488h-induced internalization in a dose-dependent manner (fig. 3, a and b).
u50,488h and dynorphin a(1-17) dose dependently promoted internalization of the flag-hkor. the ec50 values of
u50,488h and dynorphin a were 44.3 ⫾ 8.0 and 2.6 ⫾ 0.5 nm
(n ⫽ 3 each, mean ⫾ s.e.m.), respectively, and the maximal
responses were reached at about 1 and 0.1 ␮m, respectively
(fig. 4, a and b).  xxxd2070xxx  (0.1 ␮m) and levorphanol (10
␮m) increased the ec50 value of dynorphin a(1-17) by about

response. no apparent maximal responses were reached up
to 10⫺5 m u50,488h in the presence of  xxxd2070xxx  (0.1 ␮m)
and levorphanol (10 ␮m). the dose of u50,488h required to
produce the same degree (13%) of internalization was increased by about 30- and 140-fold by  xxxd2070xxx  (0.1 ␮m) and
levorphanol (10 ␮m), respectively (fig. 4, a and b).

cence. immunofluorescence staining was carried out with
m1 anti-flag antibody to detect surface and intracellular
flag-hkor. since cho cells have large nuclei and small
cytosol volumes, it is difficult to visualize internalized receptors. in contrast, hek 293 cells have much smaller nuclei
and a much larger cytosol volume; therefore, the cells are
commonly used for visualizing internalized receptor. using
fluorescence flow cytometry, we found that hek 293 cells
and cho cells were similar in the extent of u50,488h-promoted internalization of the flag-hkor; we thus used hek
293 cells for immunofluorescence microscopy. without drug
treatment, immunofluorescence staining of flag-hkor was
mostly on the cell surface. dynorphin a(1-17) and u50,488h
decreased cell-surface staining and caused punctate staining

effects of the four agonists and combinations on
phosphorylation of flag-hkor. to investigate whether
the differences among agonists in promoting receptor internalization are related to the abilities of the agonists in elevating receptor phosphorylation, we examined flag-hkor
phosphorylation induced by the four agonists. the extent of
phosphorylation of flag-hkor was in the order of dynorphin
a(1-17) ⫽ u50,488h ⬎  xxxd2070xxx , but levorphanol did not
enhance phosphorylation of flag-hkor (fig. 6). the molecular weight of phosphorylated flag-hkor was identical to
what we reported previously (li et al., 2002). u50,488hinduced phosphorylation of flag-hkor was shown to be
blocked by naloxone (li et al., 2002). we then examined
whether  xxxd2070xxx  or levorphanol had any effect on dynorphin a(1-17)- or u50,488h-induced phosphorylation. as
shown in fig. 6,  xxxd2070xxx  or levorphanol reduced dynorphin

a(1-17)- or u50,488h-induced phosphorylation of flaghkor (fig. 6).
effects of pretreatment with the four agonists on
 xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. finn
and whistler (2001) reported that lack of agonist-induced
internalization of the ␮ opioid receptor or its mutant resulted
in enhanced superactivation of adenylate cyclase. we thus
examined whether pretreatment of the flag-hkor with the
four agonists had differential effects on adenylate cyclase
superactivation. as shown in fig. 7, pretreatment with
u50,488h, dynorphin a(1-17), and  xxxd2070xxx  for 4 h enhanced  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylate cyclase to 200 to 250%
compared with the untreated control. the extents of adenylate cyclase superactivation induced by dynorphin a(1-17),
u50,488h, and  xxxd2070xxx  were not significantly different.
 xxxd2070xxx  at 0.1 ␮m and 1 ␮m produced similar effects. in
contrast, levorphanol pretreatment did not cause significant
superactivation. thus, the four agonists have differential
abilities to induce superactivation of adenylate cyclase, and
the degree of superactivation is not related to whether the
agonist causes internalization of the flag-hkor.

discussion
although  xxxd2070xxx  and levorphanol were potent full agonists for the hkor in stimulating [35s]gtp␥s binding, neither
drug caused internalization of the flag-hkor, and  xxxd2070xxx 
slightly increased, but levorphanol did not enhance, phosphorylation of the flag-hkor. rather,  xxxd2070xxx  and levorphanol acted as antagonists in reducing internalization and
phosphorylation induced by u50,488h and dynorphin a(117). to the best of our knowledge, this study represents the
first report that a full agonist of a gpcr in receptor-medi-

degrees of internalization and down-regulation of the rat ␬
opioid receptor in cho cells (jordan et al., 2000).  xxxd2070xxx 
did not induce internalization of the mouse ␬ receptor in
hek 293 cells (chu et al., 1997).
differences among agonists in promoting internalization
have also been observed for ␮ and ␦ opioid receptors.  xxxd2070xxx  and various peptide agonists promoted internalization
of both ␮ and ␦ opioid receptors, whereas morphine and
levorphanol did not (arden et al., 1995; keith et al., 1996,
1998; sternini et al., 1996; bot et al., 1997). zhang et al.
(1998) demonstrated that morphine did not induce phosphorylation of the ␮ opioid receptor. morphine partially inhibited
 xxxd2070xxx -induced internalization of the ␮ opioid receptor
(sternini et al., 1996). whether levorphanol or morphine has
antagonistic effects on phosphorylation of the ␮ or ␦ receptor
induced by other agonists has not been examined.
that four full agonists had differential abilities in promoting internalization of flag-hkor is in accord with the observations of keith et al. (1998) and alvarez et al. (2002) that
the relative ability of agonists in causing internalization of
the ␮ opioid receptor did not correlate with their abilities to
activate the receptor.
u50,488h- or dynorphin a(1-17)-activated receptors
did not affect internalization of  xxxd2070xxx - or levorphanol-occupied receptors. u50,488h or dynorphin a(117), at concentrations that caused a low level of internalization, did not facilitate  xxxd2070xxx  or levorphanol to promote
internalization. these findings are different from those of he
et al. (2002), that a low concentration of damgo facilitated
morphine to induce internalization of the ␮ opioid receptor.
they attributed the observation to oligomerization of the ␮
opioid receptor. damgo-occupied receptors in the oligomer
complexed with morphine-occupied receptors recruit internalization machinery to enable internalization of morphineoccupied receptors. although the rat ␬ opioid receptors were
shown to form homodimers or oligomers (jordan and devi,
1999), whether the human ␬ opioid receptors dimerize has
not been examined.
 xxxd2070xxx  and levorphanol were more potent in
inhibiting u50,488h- than dynorphin a(1-17)-promoted internalization.  xxxd2070xxx  (0.1 ␮m) or levorphanol
(10 ␮m) shifted the dose-response curve of u50,488h-induced internalization to the right more than that of dynorphin a(1-17). the differences may be attributed to the finding
that u50,488h and dynorphin a(1-17) bind to different domains of the ␬ opioid receptor (xue et al., 1994), and  xxxd2070xxx  and levorphanol may be able to compete more effectively with u50,488h for binding than with dynorphin a(117). in addition, it may be due to the difference in their
relative potencies at the ␬ receptor, with dynorphin a (1-17)
being ⬃15 times more potent than u50,488h.
relationship between regulation of the flag-hkor
to superactivation of adenylate cyclase. pretreatment
of cho-hkor cells for 3 or 4 h with u50,488h or dynorphin
a(1-17) caused desensitization of agonist-induced adenylate
cyclase inhibition and down-regulation of the receptor, but
levorphanol or  xxxd2070xxx  pretreatment did not (blake et al.,
1997b; zhu et al., 1998; li et al., 2000). our results indicate
that lack of desensitization, internalization, and down-regulation did not enhance the degree of adenylate cyclase superactivation following agonist pretreatment, since u50,488h
and dynorphin a(1-17), which induced regulation, and etor-

ated signaling acts as an antagonist in internalization and
phosphorylation of the receptor. in addition, u50,488h,
dynorphin a(1-17), and  xxxd2070xxx  pretreatment enhanced
 xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylate cyclase to 200 to 250% of that
of the control, but levorphanol did not. thus, the degree of
adenylate cyclase superactivation is not related to receptor
internalization.
receptor conformations required for internalization are different from those for g protein activation.
for stimulating [35s]gtp␥s binding, the ec50 values of
u50,488h and dynorphin a(1-17) were 2.07 ⫾ 0.13 and
0.14 ⫾ 0.01 nm, respectively. for promoting internalization,
the ec50 values of u50,488h and dynorphin a(1-17) were
44.3 ⫾ 8.0 and 2.6 ⫾ 0.5 nm, respectively. the finding that
ec50 values of u50,488h and dynorphin a(1-17) in promoting internalization were 21 and 19 times, respectively, those
for stimulating [35s]gtp␥s binding supports the notion that
different conformations are required for the two processes.
whereas dynorphin a(1-17) and u50,488h can induce conformational changes resulting in g protein coupling and receptor internalization,  xxxd2070xxx  and levorphanol can only
induce conformational alterations leading to g protein activation, but not receptor internalization. the study supports
the notion that there are multiple activated states for
gpcrs, the models for which have been proposed (for example, scaramellini and leff, 1998). our results are consistent
with those of mhaouty-kodja et al. (1999), that although two
different constitutively active mutants of the ␣1b-adrenergic
receptor had similar agonist-independent activities, the
a6.34(293)e mutant had an enhanced basal phosphorylation
level and underwent ␤-arrestin-mediated basal and agonistinduced internalization, but the d3.49(142)a mutant did not.
differential effects of agonists in promoting phosphorylation and internalization of the ␬ receptors.
our findings that levorphanol or  xxxd2070xxx  did not promote
internalization is in accord with the report of blake et al.
(1997b) that neither drug caused desensitization or downregulation of the hkor. that dynorphin a and u50,488h
induced phosphorylation and internalization is consistent
with the observations that dynorphin a and u50,488h
caused desensitization and down-regulation of the hkor
(blake et al., 1997b; ling et al., 1998; zhu et al., 1998; li et
al., 2000; zhang et al., 2002). it is interesting that  xxxd2070xxx 
enhanced phosphorylation, albeit to a lesser extent than
u50,488h or dynorphin a(1-17), but did not promote internalization under the same condition. overexpression of
 xxxg970xxx  and arrestin-2 facilitated  xxxd2070xxx  to induce downregulation of the hkor (li et al., 2000).
it should be noted that the rat ␬ opioid receptor stably
expressed in cho cells did not undergo u50,488h-induced
regulation (avidor-reiss et al., 1995; li et al., 1999, 2000;
jordan et al., 2000; zhang et al., 2002), even with overexpression of  xxxg970xxx  and arrestin-2 (li et al., 2002). this species
difference was attributed to the amino acid sequence difference in the c-terminal domain, particularly asn358 versus
ser358 in the hkor (li et al., 2002; zhang et al., 2002).
u50,488h caused phosphorylation and desensitization of the
guinea pig ␬ opioid receptor, which has ser358 as the hkor
(appleyard et al., 1997). in other cells, u69,593 or u50,488h
did or did not cause desensitization of the mouse or rat ␬
receptor (joseph and bidlack, 1995; tallent et al., 1998;
appleyard et al., 1999). dynorphin peptides induced small

phine, which did not, caused similar degrees of superactivation. in addition, levorphanol, which did not cause internalization and down-regulation, did not induce superactivation
of adenylate cyclase. these results are different from those of
finn and whistler (2001). using different agonists and mutants of the ␮ opioid receptor, these researchers found that
lack of internalization enhanced the extent of superactivation of adenylate cyclase. they hypothesized that the persistent stimulation of cell-surface receptors caused higher degrees of cellular adaptation. the reasons for this difference
are not clear. the events following activation of the ␬ opioid
receptor leading to superactivation of adenylate cyclase may
be different from those following ␮ receptor activation.
regulation of opioid receptors by  xxxd2070xxx  and
levorphanol. we found that  xxxd2070xxx  and levorphanol did
not promote internalization of the hkor. however,  xxxd2070xxx 
induced internalization of the ␮ and ␦ opioid receptors (chu
et al., 1997; keith et al., 1998). levorphanol pretreatment did
not internalize the ␦ receptor (bot et al., 1997), and whether
it internalized the ␮ receptor has not been reported.  xxxd2070xxx  pretreatment of the hkor resulted in superactivation of
adenylate cyclase, but levorphanol did not. following treatment of the ␮ receptor with  xxxd2070xxx  or levorphanol, no
superactivaiton of adenylate cyclase was observed (blake et
al., 1997a).
relationship between receptor regulation and opioid tolerance. repeated administration of ␬ opioid agonists
leads to tolerance to the antinociceptive effect of ␬ agonists
(murray and cowan, 1988; bhargava et al., 1989), which may
be partially accounted for at the receptor level (von voigtlander et al., 1983; bhargava et al., 1989; morris and herz,
1989; joseph and bidlack, 1995). opioid tolerance is underlain by a multitude of biological mechanisms. there are two
opposing views regarding the relationship between agonistinduced regulation of the ␮ opioid receptor and opioid tolerance. bohn et al. (2000) showed that ␤-arrestin 2-deficient
mice did not develop tolerance to morphine, indicating that
␤-arrestin 2-mediated biological events, which include agonist-induced desensitization, internalization, and down-regulation, contribute significantly to morphine tolerance. in
contrast, he et al. (2002) reported that a small dose of
damgo facilitated morphine to stimulate internalization of
the ␮ opioid receptor, and rats treated chronically with both
drugs showed reduced analgesic tolerance compared with
rats treated with morphine alone, indicating that receptor
internalization reduces morphine tolerance. an agonist that
does not cause internalization may produce different degrees
of tolerance from an agonist that promotes internalization.
an agonist that blocks internalization induced by another
agonist may modulate tolerance development of the second
agonist. needless to say, these hypotheses have to be tested
in vivo.
conclusion. dynorphin a(1-17) and u50,488h promoted
internalization of the flag-hkor, but  xxxd2070xxx  or levorphanol did not, although all were potent full agonists. three
agonists induced phosphorylation of flag-hkor in the order
of dynorphin a ⫽ u50,488h ⬎  xxxd2070xxx , but levorphanol did
not.  xxxd2070xxx  or levorphanol reduced dynorphin- or
u50,488h-induced phosphorylation and internalization.
u50,488h, dynorphin a(1-17), and  xxxd2070xxx  induced superactivation of adenylate cyclase, but levorphanol did not.
taken together, these results indicate that agonists have
