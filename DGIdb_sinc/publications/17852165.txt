in published reports of  xxxd2698xxx  ingestion, clinical effects are hypertension, bradycardia, pallor, diaphoresis, and respiratory distress.
we report three cases of acute pulmonary edema after the intentional ingestion of  xxxd2698xxx -containing antiseptic  xxxd305xxx  liquid. these
cases presented with altered mental status, hypertension, bradycardia, and diaphoresis. chest x-ray on admission revealed acute pulmonary
edema. two cases required mechanical ventilation. all of these clinical effects resolved within 24 hours and the patients were discharged
with no sequelae. since  xxxd2698xxx  stimulates the peripheral alpha-2 adrenergic receptor, we speculate that intense vasoconstriction may
have elevated cardiac afterload and left atrial-ventricular blood volume and caused acute pulmonary edema.

introduction
 xxxd2698xxx , an imidazoline derivative, is a sympathomimetic
drug that is mostly employed as a topical nasal or ocular
decongestant. in japan, antiseptic  xxxd305xxx  liquids containing
 xxxd2698xxx  are sold in drug stores and are available without a
doctor’s prescription.  xxxd2698xxx  stimulates central and
peripheral alpha-2 adrenergic receptors causing central nervous depression and peripheral vascular constriction. the common clinical effects of  xxxd2698xxx  overdose are hypertension,
bradycardia, pallor, diaphoresis, and respiratory distress (1–3).
acute pulmonary edema after  xxxd2698xxx  ingestion has not
been reported. we present three adult cases of acute pulmonary
edema following ingestion of a  xxxd2698xxx -containing antiseptic  xxxd305xxx  liquid in suicide attempts (4).

case 1
a 53-year-old man ingested an antiseptic  xxxd305xxx  liquid
(0.1%  xxxd2698xxx ) in an attempt to commit suicide about
four hours prior to admission. on admission, he was comatose and his blood pressure was 160/100 mmhg, heart rate
was 72 beats/min, and respiratory rate was 10 breaths/min.
findings from physical examination of the chest and abdomen were normal. results of arterial blood gas analysis (on
face mask oxygen at 5 l/min) were ph 7.382, pao2 60.4

mmhg, and paco2 42.0 mmhg. a chest x-ray revealed pulmonary edema in the left lung field (fig. 1). he was intubated
because of cessation of spontaneous breathing and was
admitted to the intensive care unit. sixteen hours after admission, he became alert and his cardiopulmonary status recovered spontaneously. he was discharged with arrangements
made for a consultation with a psychiatrist.

case 2
a 40-year-old man with a history of depression ingested an
antiseptic  xxxd305xxx  liquid (0.1%  xxxd2698xxx ) in a suicide
attempt. about an hour after ingestion, he vomited and
complained of nausea and headache. on admission, two
hours post-ingestion, he was diaphoretic and his glasgow
coma scale was 10 (e3 v3 m4). his blood pressure was
182/100 mmhg and heart rate was 38 beats/min. on lung ausculation, wet rales were heard bilaterally. a chest x-ray revealed
bilateral pulmonary edema with mild cardiac enlargement.
results of arterial blood gas analysis (on face mask oxygen at
5 l/min) were ph 7.347, pao2 71.5 mmhg, and paco2 41.1
mmhg.  xxxd1934xxx  hydrochloride was administered at a dose of
150 mg intravenously because his respiratory rate had decreased
to 8 breaths/min. before admission to the intensive care unit, his
cardiopulmonary status recovered and chest x-ray cleared. he
was discharged on the following day without sequelae.

case 3
a previously healthy 32-year-old man with a 2-year history
of depression ingested three bottles of antiseptic  xxxd305xxx

(= 1.7 l/min/m2), increased intrathoracic blood volume index
(itbvi=1260 ml/m2, normal 850–1000 ml/m2), and elevated
extravascular lung water index (evlwi=21 ml/kg, normal
<7 ml/kg). fluid infusion was decreased (500 ml/h to 100 ml/h)
and dobutamine (6 mcg/kg/min) was started to increase cardiac output. about 12 hours after ingestion, spontaneous
breathing was restored and the patient became alert. blood
pressure returned to a normal range. his cardiac index was
increased to 2.5 l/min/m2, itbvi decreased to 714 ml/m2
and evlwi decreased to 10 ml/kg. a chest x-ray showed
resolution of the pulmonary edema (fig. 2, right). he was
discharged from the intensive care unit and transferred to a
psychiatric ward (fig. 3).

liquid (total amount of  xxxd2698xxx , 225mg) in a suicide
attempt. two hours later, his family found him unconscious
and he was brought to our emergency center. on admission,
he was diaphoretic and his glasgow coma scale was 3. his
blood pressure was 210/138 mmhg, heart rate 52 beats/min,
and respiratory rate 8 breaths/min. a chest x-ray revealed mild
pulmonary edema and mild cardiac enlargement (fig. 2, left).
he was intubated and put on a ventilator.  xxxd2718xxx  was
started at a dose of 3 mg/h for the severe hypertension. the
results of arterial blood gas analysis (fio2 0.6) were ph
7.353, pao2 299.9 mmhg, paco2 42.2 mmhg, base excess
–2.2 mmol/l, hco3- 22.8 mmol/l, and serum lactate 32 mg/dl.

these three cases developed acute pulmonary edema soon
after ingestion of a  xxxd2698xxx -containing antiseptic  xxxd305xxx 
liquid. this antiseptic, which is available at any drug store in
japan, also contains 0.1%  xxxd1869xxx  hydrochloride and 0.2%
chlorpheniramine maleate. acute pulmonary edema caused
by these two drugs has not been reported (5,6). because of
their pharmacologic properties,  xxxd1869xxx  hydrochloride and
chlorpheniramine maleate are unlikely to have been the causative agent. we did not measure  xxxd2698xxx  in the blood or
urine of any of our patients. however, since imidazoline
intoxication induces hypertension by peripheral vascular constriction (2),  xxxd2698xxx  was probably the cause of the acute
pulmonary edema. intense hypertension and pulmonary
edema after sympathomimetic drug administration have been
reported (7–9). catecholamines or other vasoconstrictive
agents increase peripheral vascular tone, which is followed
by severe hypertension, increased cardiac afterload,
decreased cardiac output, increased cardiac blood volume,

and elevated left atrial pressure. these hemodynamic
changes may produce acute pulmonary edema. we speculate
that the  xxxd2698xxx  overdose caused acute pulmonary edema
through the same mechanism as a sympathomimetic drug
overdose. stamer et al. reported a pediatric case of acute pulmonary edema induced by  xxxd2698xxx  and speculated that
the same mechanism was responsible (10). in case 3, picco
monitoring showed an unusually elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure with decreased cardiac output, increased
itbvi and evlwi. these data suggest that  xxxd2698xxx 
excessively elevated the cardiac afterload, which increased
cardiac blood volume, followed by development of acute pulmonary edema.
in the literature on  xxxd2698xxx  ingestion, most reports are
of unintentional  xxxd2698xxx  exposure in children from nasal
or ocular decongestants. in most of these naphazolinecontaining over-the-counter drugs, the concentration of  xxxd2698xxx  is between 0.05% and 0.1% (1,3). the antiseptic
 xxxd305xxx  liquid that the presented cases ingested also contains
0.1%  xxxd2698xxx . our cases were suicidal adults, so the
patients ingested much more  xxxd2698xxx  than the published
pediatric cases and exhibited a more severe clinical course. in
stamer’s report, intrabronchial application of 3–4 mg  xxxd2698xxx -induced pulmonary edema (10). since imidazoline
derivatives have a narrow therapeutic window, especially in
children, any drug that contains  xxxd2698xxx  might cause
acute pulmonary edema.  xxxd2698xxx -induced symptoms
resolve within 24 hours and close observation of the clinical
course is important. for severe cases, such as those that we
described, intensive management such as mechanical ventilation
and cardiovascular monitoring may be required.
in summary, we reported acute pulmonary edema temporally related to intentional  xxxd2698xxx  ingestion. intense

vasoconstriction by alpha-2 adrenergic receptor stimulation
results in acute pulmonary edema. physicians should be
aware of the toxicity of  xxxd2698xxx  on the cardiopulmonary
system.
