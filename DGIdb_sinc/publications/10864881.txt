1 betaxolol, a b1-adrenoceptor antagonist used for the treatment of glaucoma, is known to be
neuroprotective in paradigms of ischaemia/excitotoxicity. in this study, we examined whether
betaxolol and other b-adrenoceptor antagonists interact directly with neurotoxin binding to sites 1
and 2 of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel (na+ channel) in rat cerebrocortical synaptosomes.
2 betaxolol inhibited speci®c [3h]-batrachotoxinin-a 20-a-benzoate ([3h]- xxxd360xxx ) binding to
neurotoxin site 2 in a concentration-dependent manner with an ic50 value of 9.8 mm. comparison of
all the b-adrenoceptor antagonists tested revealed a potency order of propranolol4betaxolol&levobetaxolol4levobunolol&carteolol5timolol4atenolol.
3 none of the drugs caused a signi®cant inhibition of [3h]-saxitoxin binding to neurotoxin receptor
site 1, even at concentrations as high as 250 mm.
4 saturation experiments showed that betaxolol increased the kd of [3h]- xxxd360xxx  binding but had
no eect on the bmax. the association kinetics of [3h]- xxxd360xxx  were unaected by betaxolol, but the
drug signi®cantly accelerated the dissociation rate of the radioligand. these ®ndings argue for a
competitive, indirect, allosteric mode of inhibition of [3h]- xxxd360xxx  binding by betaxolol.
5 betaxolol inhibited veratridine-stimulated na+ in¯ux in rat cortical synaptosomes with an ic50
value of 28.3 mm. carteolol,  xxxd2467xxx ,  xxxd3377xxx  and atenolol were signi®cantly less eective than
betaxolol at reducing veratridine-evoked na+ in¯ux.
6 the ability of betaxolol to interact with neurotoxin site 2 of the na+ channel and inhibit na+
in¯ux may have a role in its neuroprotective action in paradigms of excitotoxicity/ischaemia and in
its therapeutic eect in glaucoma.

introduction
b-adrenoceptor antagonists are the most commonly used class
of antiglaucoma agents. their mechanism of action, like that
of all antiglaucoma drugs, involves lowering intraocular
pressure. however, while raised intraocular pressure is clearly
a signi®cant risk factor for glaucoma, much evidence has
accumulated which suggests that targeting intraocular pressure
alone is not sucient to prevent death of retinal neurons and
consequent loss of visual ®eld. accordingly, a consensus is
evolving which proposes that treatment strategies may be
better focused on neuroprotection. in glaucoma, death of
retinal ganglion cells, and their axons that form the optic
nerve, occurs over a long period of time via a cascade of events
which is little understood. nevertheless, evidence for an
ischaemic/excitotoxic-like pathway of ganglion cell death in
glaucoma, with some similarities to that occurring in the brain
after a stroke or heart attack, is accumulating (osborne et al.,
1999c; vorwerk et al., 1999).
recent work indicates that the b1-adrenoceptor antagonist
betaxolol is a retinal neuroprotective agent in animals, since
topical or i.p. administration of the drug attenuates
excitotoxicity-induced damage to ganglion cells and the eects
of ischaemia to the retina (osborne et al., 1997; 1999b). no
similar data have been reported for other b-blockers, such as

*author for correspondence; e-mail: neville.osborne@eye.ox.ac.uk

 xxxd3377xxx ,  xxxd2467xxx  and carteolol, commonly prescribed for
glaucoma. these data correlate well with clinical observations,
which suggest that glaucoma patients treated with betaxolol
fare often better than, and at least as well as, patients treated
with  xxxd3377xxx  with regard to their visual ®elds (messmer et al.,
1991; kaiser et al., 1992; 1994; collignon brach, 1994; drance,
1998). since  xxxd3377xxx  reduces intraocular pressure more
eectively than betaxolol in humans (sorensen & abel,
1996), the combined data support the argument that factors
other than elevated pressure contribute to glaucomatous optic
neuropathy. various studies have shown that betaxolol, in
common with many b-blockers, acts as a calcium channel
blocker (setoguchi et al., 1995). importantly, of all the bblockers used in the treatment of glaucoma, betaxolol is the
most eective calcium channel blocker (yu et al., 1999).
moreover, recent work has shown that betaxolol interacts
directly with l-type calcium channels (melena et al., 1999).
since various studies have shown that calcium channel
blockers can attenuate nmda- or ischaemia-induced insults
to neurons (kobayashi & mori, 1998), it follows that the
neuroprotective properties of betaxolol may well be associated
with its calcium channel blocking activity (osborne et al.,
1999b). however, the potency of betaxolol in reducing calcium
in¯ux into neurons may not be sucient to account for its
complete neuroprotective action, and furthermore there is little
evidence that l-type voltage-gated calcium channel blockers

760

g. chidlow et al

are eective neuroprotectants in the retina. for this reason, it
was postulated that additional mechanisms of neuroprotection
for betaxolol must be considered.
voltage-sensitive sodium channels (na+ channels) are
responsible for the generation and propagation of action
potentials in axons. they comprise three subunits, but the
physiological function is primarily subserved by the a-subunit.
interestingly, a considerable structural similarity exists
between calcium channel a1-subunits and na+ channel asubunits and many calcium channel blockers have anity for
na+ channels. there are three main types of na+ channel asubunits in the cns, namely types i, ii and iii, each of which
has been identi®ed in rat retinal ganglion cells (fjell et al.,
1997). several neurotoxins are known to interact with speci®c,
allosterically coupled binding sites on the na+ channel and
alter channel function. at least six classes of toxin receptor
sites are currently recognized, the most important of which are
sites 1 and 2. site 1 is thought to be located in the vestibule of
the channel and binding of water soluble toxins such as
saxitoxin and tetrodotoxin directly leads to inhibition of ion
conductance. site 2 is found in the transmembrane region and
is involved in the gating of the channel. lipophilic toxins
including veratridine and batrachotoxin bind at site 2 causing a
persistent activation of the channel, which can be reversed by
tetrodotoxin in a non-competitive fashion. a number of local
anaesthetics, antiarrhythmics and anticonvulsants reduce
neuronal excitability through an indirect negative allosteric
interaction with receptor site 2 of the na+ channel (catterall,
1987). moreover, some b-adrenoceptor antagonists possess
local anaesthetic activity and these compounds are known to
interact with the batrachotoxin binding site (ijzerman et al.,
1987).
a variety of sodium channel blockers have been shown to
oer protection to neurons in experimental models of cerebral
ischaemia and in models of white matter damage (see
narahashi et al., 1997; carter, 1998; obrenovitch, 1998).
more pertinent with respect to the retina, anoxic injury to the
rat optic nerve can be ameliorated by exposure to the sodium
channel blocker tetrodotoxin (stys et al., 1992b; waxman et
al., 1994) and by local anaesthetics (stys et al., 1992a), which,
as mentioned previously, inhibit toxin binding to site 2.
given the known anity of some b-adrenoceptor antagonists for na+ channels, the anity of betaxolol for l-type
calcium channels and the neuroprotective action of the drug,
the aim of this study was to examine whether betaxolol, and
other b-adrenoceptor antagonists currently used as antiglaucoma agents, interact directly with na+ channels. this was
achieved by examining their eects on the binding of [3h]batrachotoxinin ([3h]- xxxd360xxx ) and [3h]-saxitoxin ([3h]-stx)
and on na+ in¯ux in rat cortex.

methods
[3h]- xxxd360xxx  binding assays
preparation of cerebrocortical membranes adult wistar rats
(250 ± 350 g) were killed by decapitation and the cerebral
cortex separated from other brain regions over ice. the tissue
was roughly chopped and homogenized in 10 volumes of icecold 0.32 m sucrose, 5 mm k2hpo4, ph 7.4 using a motordriven polytetra¯uoroethylene-glass homogenizer. the homogenate was centrifuged at 10006g for 10 min at 48c and the
resulting supernatant centrifuged at 39,0006g for 20 min at
48c. the pellet was resuspended in na+ free buer (in mm:
choline chloride 130, kcl 5.4,  xxxd2534xxx  0.8, d-glucose 5.5,

hepes-tris 50, ph 7.4) and recentrifuged at 39,0006g for
20 min at 48c. the pellet was resuspended in na+ free buer
at an approximate protein concentration of 3 mg ml71, snap
frozen in liquid n2 and stored at 7808c until required. protein
concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid
protein assay kit (sigma).
equilibrium binding assays [3h]- xxxd360xxx  binding was determined essentially as described by shimidzu et al. (1997).
brie¯y, aliquots of cortical membranes (200 ± 400 mg protein)
were incubated for 60 min at 378c in na+ free buer
containing 10 nm (inhibition experiments) or 2.5 ± 80 nm
(saturation experiments) [3h]- xxxd360xxx , 1 mm tetrodotoxin,
30 mg scorpion venom (leiurus quinquestriatus) and 1 mg ml71
bsa, with or without the drug to be tested. nonspeci®c
binding was measured in the presence of 300 mm veratridine.
the binding reactions were terminated by the addition of 3 ml
of ice-cold washing buer (in mm: choline chloride 163, mgcl2
0.8, cacl2 1.8, hepes-tris 5, ph 7.4). following rapid
vacuum ®ltration through whatman gf/b glass ®bre ®lters,
the samples were washed a further three times with the same
buer. bound radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry in 5 ml of insta-gel plus.
kinetic binding assays the rates of dissociation and association of [3h]- xxxd360xxx  from cerebrocortical na+ channel binding
sites were determined essentially as described by ratnakumari
& hemmings (1996). for dissociation experiments, aliquots of
cortical membranes were incubated for 60 min at 378c with
10 nm [3h]- xxxd360xxx , 30 mg scorpion venom, 1 mm tetrodotoxin
and 1 mg ml71 bsa as in the equilibrium assays. dissociation
was initiated by addition of 300 mm veratridine+betaxolol (10
or 100 mm) at time zero. reactions were stopped at 5, 10, 20,
30 and 45 min as for equilibrium experiments.
the rate of association of [3h]- xxxd360xxx  was measured by
incubating aliquots of cortical membranes in na+ free buer
containing 1 mm tetrodotoxin, 1 mg ml71 bsa and 30 mg
scorpion venom for 15 min at 378c in the absence or presence
of 100 mm betaxolol. [3h]- xxxd360xxx  (10 nm) was then added and
the incubations terminated after 5, 10, 20, 30 and 60 min as for
equilibrium experiments. non-speci®c binding was determined
in parallel at each time point.

[3h]-stx binding assays
cortical membranes were prepared as for the [3h]- xxxd360xxx 
binding assay (see above) and the [3h]-stx assay performed
essentially as described by shimidzu et al. (1997). to each tube
was added 50 ml of [3h]-stx (2.5 nm ®nal concentration),
50 ml of na+ free buer or drug to be tested and, to initiate the
assay, 100 ml of membrane suspension (200 ± 400 mg protein).
incubation occurred at 378c for 30 min and binding reactions
were terminated as described for [3h]- xxxd360xxx  assays. speci®c
binding was de®ned as the dierence between total binding and
binding obtained in the presence of 1 mm tetrodotoxin.

measurement of na+ in¯ux
preparation of synaptoneurosomes synaptosomes were prepared according to the method of dunkley et al. (1988).
brie¯y, adult male wistar rats were killed by decapitation.
brains were rapidly removed and rinsed in ice-cold gradient
buer consisting of 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm edta and 0.25 mm
dithiothreitol, ph 7.4. the cerebral cortex was separated and
homogenized in 10 volumes of gradient buer using a motordriven polytetra¯uoroethylene-glass homogenizer. the homo-

genate was centrifuged at 10006g for 10 min at 48c and the
resultant supernatant collected and diluted with gradient
buer to yield a protein concentration of approximately
5 mg ml71. aliquots (2 ml) of this fraction were layered onto
discontinuous percoll gradients consisting of four 2.5 ml layers
of 3, 10, 15 and 23% (v v71) ®ltered (0.45 mm) percoll gradient
buer. the gradients were centrifuged at 30,0006g for 4.5 min
at 48c. the synaptosomal fraction was collected from the 23/
15% interface and diluted approximately 5 fold in ice-cold low
na+ buer (in mm: choline chloride 130, kcl 5.4,  xxxd2534xxx  0.8,
d-glucose 5.5, nacl 5, hepes-tris 50, ph 7.4), which was
previously bubbled for 1 h with 95% o2/5% co2. the
synaptosomes were centrifuged at 25,0006g for 10 min at
48c and resuspended in low na+ buer to give a ®nal protein
concentration of 3.5 ± 4.5 mg ml71.
na+ in¯ux na+ uptake was determined by a modi®cation of
the method described by tamkun & catterall (1981). aliquots
of freshly prepared synaptosomes containing approximately
350 ± 450 mg of proteins were preincubated at 378c for 10 min
with or without test agents. following preincubation, 0.5 mci
of 22na+ in low na+ buer was added and the samples were
incubated for 10 min at 378c. uptake was initiated by the
addition of 100 mm veratridine and terminated after 30 s by the
addition of 3 ml of ice-cold washing. samples were rapidly
vacuum ®ltered through whatman gf/b ®lters presoaked for
2 h in 0.1% polyethylenimine and washed three times with
3 ml of ice-cold washing buer. trapped radioactivity was
measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry in 5 ml of instagel plus. non-speci®c uptake of na+ was determined in the
presence of 1 mm tetrodotoxin.

analysis of data
the hill coecients and ic50 values for competition binding
data were obtained using a nonlinear method (graphpad
prism 1.0). the dissociation rate constant (k71) was calculated
from linear regression analysis of ln(bt/b0) versus t, where bt
and b0 are the amount of radioligand bound at t and t zero,
respectively. the association rate constant (k+1) was
determined using the equation k+1=(kobs ± k71)/[l]. the
observed rate constant (kobs) was calculated from linear
regression analysis of ln(beq/beq ± bt) versus t, where bt and
beq are the amount of radioligand bound at t and equilibrium,
respectively, and [l] is the concentration of [3h]- xxxd360xxx . the
slope of the plot (kobs)=[l]k+1+k71, from which k+1 could
be calculated. statistical analysis was performed by analysis of
variance (anova) with the bonferroni post-test or by
student's t-test.

binding
the eects of various b-adrenoceptor antagonists on speci®c
binding of [3h]- xxxd360xxx  are shown in figure 1. all of the drugs
tested inhibited binding completely in a concentrationdependent fashion with the exception of atenolol, which even
at 1 mm was only weakly active, while none of the drugs
displaced non-speci®c binding. a potency order of propranolol4racemic betaxolol&levobetaxolol4levobunolol&carteolol5timolol4atenolol was obtained. no stereoselectivity was
evident with regard to the eect of betaxolol. the ic50 values
for the inhibition of [3h]- xxxd360xxx  binding are shown in table 1.
since the concentration of [3h]- xxxd360xxx  used is substantially
less than its kd, the ic50 values obtained are eectively equal
to the ki values. hill coecients are all close to unity indicating

the likelihood of competitive inhibition. the relatively high
anity of propranolol for [3h]- xxxd360xxx  binding is welldocumented (postma & catterall, 1984; grima et al., 1987)
and explained by its action as a local anaesthetic. however, the
potency of betaxolol was considerably higher than for the
other b-antagonists and accordingly its eect on [3h]- xxxd360xxx 
binding was examined in more detail.

eect of betaxolol on saturation and kinetic properties
of [3h]- xxxd360xxx  binding
in order to explore further the mechanism of the interaction of
betaxolol with neurotoxin site 2, the eect of the drug on
saturation and kinetic properties of [3h]- xxxd360xxx  binding to
cortical membranes was assessed. saturation analysis of [3h] xxxd360xxx  binding revealed a single class of binding sites with a
kd of 29.5+1.24 nm (mean+s.e.mean) and a bmax of
1.43+0.05 pmol mg71 protein (figure 2). inclusion of 10 mm
betaxolol in the assay resulted in a signi®cant increase in the
kd 55.7+8.4 nm (n=3; p50.05) but little change in the bmax
(1.34+0.08 pmol mg71 protein), suggesting that the inhibition
was likely to be competitive in nature.
in kinetic studies, the dissociation of [3h]- xxxd360xxx  from
cortical membranes in the presence of a saturating concentration
of competitive ligand veratridine was relatively slow with
k71=0.0088+0.0007 min71 (n=4; figure 3). co-incubation
with betaxolol (10 mm) caused a slight but insigni®cant increase
in the dissociation rate constant k71=0.0113+0.0010 (n=4)
and a 10 fold higher concentration of betaxolol (100 mm)
increased the dissociation rate constant dramatically
k71=0.0241+0.0010 (n=4; p50.01; figure 3). in contrast to
its eect on the rate of dissociation of [3h]- xxxd360xxx  from cortical
membranes, betaxolol (up to 100 mm) had no eect on the rate of
association of [3h]- xxxd360xxx  (k+1=0.0026+0.0006 and
0.0023+0.0020 min71 nm71 in the absence and presence of
100 mm betaxolol, respectively).

experiment performed in duplicate. values for bmax were
1.46 pmol mg71 protein and 1.24 pmol mg71 protein in the absence
and presence of betaxolol, respectively. the kd values were 29.2 and
55.8 nm, respectively. two additional experiments yielded similar
results.

as shown in table 2, none of the b-adrenoceptor antagonists
caused a signi®cant inhibition of [3h]-stx binding in rat

in contrast, tetrodotoxin potently displaced [3h]-stx binding
with an ic50 value of 37 nm (data not shown). however, it
should be noted that propranolol did reduce speci®c binding
by 15%, a level of inhibition which may have reached
signi®cance with repeated measurement.

betaxolol inhibits voltage-sensitive sodium channels

discussion
it has recently been demonstrated that betaxolol can interact
directly with l-type ca2+ channels in rat cortex (melena et al.,
1999). the data presented in this study show that betaxolol can
interact with voltage-sensitive sodium channels on cortical
synaptosomes and reduce na+ in¯ux. the anity and manner
by which betaxolol displaced [3h]- xxxd360xxx  binding in rat cortex
(ic50=9.8 mm; nh=0.92) correlated well with the inhibitory
action of the drug on veratridine-stimulated na+ in¯ux in the
same tissue (ic50=28.3 mm; nh=0.80), suggesting that these
eects occur at a single class of sites. however, the ligand had
no eect on the binding of saxitoxin to receptor site 1. it is
clear, therefore, that betaxolol does not interfere with ion

conductance directly but rather modulates the gating mechanism of the na+ channel. as very similar data were generated
for racemic betaxolol and levobetaxolol, we can conclude that
stereoselectivity is not important with regard to the anity of
betaxolol for the batrachotoxin site. stereospeci®city is
discernible for some local anaesthetics, but like betaxolol, the
d- and l-isomers of propranolol are equipotent at [3h]- xxxd360xxx 
sites (postma & catterall, 1984).
the results of scatchard analysis indicate that the inhibition
of [3h]- xxxd360xxx  binding by betaxolol is competitive, since in the
presence of betaxolol an increase in kd was recorded without a
reduction in total binding capacity. kinetic analysis showed
that the association rate of the radioligand was unaected by
betaxolol, but the dissociation rate of [3h]- xxxd360xxx  was
accelerated by increasing concentrations of the drug. these
®ndings argue for an indirect allosteric mode of inhibition by
betaxolol. in fact, the results we obtained with betaxolol are
very similar to those reported by ratnakumari & hemmings
(1996) for propofol. our data thus support the view that
allosteric inhibition of the interaction between activating
neurotoxins and receptor site 2 by various drugs is best
accounted for by selective high anity binding to a
hydrophobic site distinct from, yet coupled to, neurotoxin site
2. this binding site is able to interact with a number of
chemically diverse drugs, including local anaesthetics, anticonvulsants and antiarrhythmics (catterall, 1987), the general
anaesthetic propofol (ratnakumari & hemmings, 1996), badrenoceptor antagonists (ijzerman et al., 1987), calcium
channel blockers (grima et al., 1988) and neuroprotective
compounds (shimidzu et al., 1997). these drugs are thought to
inhibit na+ channel activity by preferential interaction with
the inactivated state of the channel (catterall, 1987).
the potency of betaxolol at cortical [3h]- xxxd360xxx  sites was
similar to, and higher than, many drugs whose function is
mediated by blockade of na+ channels (postma & catterall,
1984). however, signi®cant pharmacological dierences are
apparent between cardiac and neuronal isoforms of na+
channels (fozzard & hanck, 1996). for example, local
anaesthetics such as lidocaine and antiarrhythmics have a
higher ecacy on heart rather than nerve na+ channels,
permitting drugs to be used to treat cardiac conditions without
interfering with neuronal function. conversely, the novel
neuroprotective compound ns-7 inhibited [3h]- xxxd360xxx  binding in cardiac cells 13 fold less potently than in brain tissue
(shimidzu et al., 1997). given the lack of antiarrhythmic
activity of betaxolol, it would be expected that the drug is
likewise signi®cantly more active at brain rather than cardiac
na+ channels.
interestingly, betaxolol displayed at least 5 fold higher
potency for na+ channels than the other commonly prescribed
b-adrenoceptor antagonists used for the treatment of
glaucoma (carteolol,  xxxd3377xxx ,  xxxd2467xxx ). the most logical
explanation for the greater anity of betaxolol is provided by
the lipophilic nature of the compound. figure 5 reveals that,
with the exception of carteolol, a good correlation exists
between the partition co-ecients of b-adrenoceptor antagonists and their potencies at rat cortical [3h]- xxxd360xxx  binding
sites. propranolol and betaxolol are highly lipophilic and
potent displacers of [3h]- xxxd360xxx  binding,  xxxd2467xxx  and
 xxxd3377xxx  are moderately lipophilic and are less potent inhibitors,
while atenolol is hydrophilic and possesses little anity for
neurotoxin site 2. lipophilicity is of prime importance in
determining the anity of various ligands for the [3h]- xxxd360xxx 
binding site, which is understandable given its hydrophobic
location within the membrane. ijzerman et al. (1987) showed
that lipophilicity is the key determinant as to whether bbritish journal of pharmacology, vol 130 (4)

betaxolol inhibits voltage-sensitive sodium channels

adrenoceptor antagonists inhibit [3h]- xxxd360xxx  binding. however, in ijzerman's study, lipophilicity did not account for all
of the observed variance in binding anities between dierent
b-adrenoceptor antagonists. similarly, in this study, propranolol displays higher potency for cortical [3h]- xxxd360xxx  binding
sites than betaxolol, yet the compounds are equally lipophilic,
while atenolol and carteolol are both hydrophilic and yet
carteolol shows much greater anity for na+ channels. an
explanation for this anomaly was provided by ijzerman who
showed that steric factors play a part in determining anity of
b-adrenoceptor antagonists for [3h]- xxxd360xxx  sites. substitution
para to the aliphatic side chain introduces not only b1selectivity but also, through steric hindrance, a reduced anity
for [3h]- xxxd360xxx  binding sites. betaxolol and atenolol have
bulky para substituents and consequently are less eective na+
channel blockers than propranolol and carteolol, respectively,
which have no para substitution. in fact, the additional
potency of propranolol over betaxolol at na+ channels is
presumably a contributory factor in the potent local
anaesthetic properties displayed by propranolol. local
anaesthetic activity, also known as membrane stabilizing
activity, is an undesirable side-eect of b-adrenoceptor
antagonists used in glaucoma therapy and is manifested as a
reduction in corneal sensitivity. unlike propranolol, which
rapidly induces corneal desensitization, betaxolol possesses
only minor local anaesthetic properties, which do not prevent
its use as a therapeutic agent (buckley et al., 1990; zimmerman, 1993).
the rationale for examining whether betaxolol can interact
with na+ channels stems from the considerable interest into
whether drugs used for the treatment of glaucoma can act as
neuroprotectants for the ganglion cells of the retina. in
glaucoma, death of neurons occurs gradually over many years,
and thus pursuing a strategy of neuroprotection should
theoretically be more rewarding for this disease than for
severe, acute conditions such as stroke (osborne et al., 1999a).
a wealth of indirect evidence points to a mild yet chronic
ischaemic/hypoxic-like pathway being responsible for ganglion
cell loss in glaucoma. it follows, therefore, that drugs which
can diminish the intensity of such an insult should ameliorate
to some extent the damage to ganglion cells and the optic nerve
head. reducing calcium in¯ux is one potential strategy for
achieving this aim and much evidence exists that betaxolol can
act as a calcium channel blocker (setoguchi et al., 1995). the
®nding of this study that betaxolol can inhibit na+ in¯ux
through a direct interaction with the na+ channel is not
unsurprising given ®rstly, the impressive structural similarity
that is evident between the na+ and ca2+ a-subunits (fozzard
& hanck, 1996) and secondly, the known ability of many
calcium channel blockers to bind with high anity to na+
channels (velly et al., 1987; grima et al., 1988). na+ channel
blockade is considered to be an eective means of prolonging
the survival of cells during periods of physiological stress
caused by limited oxygen and nutrient supply (goldin et al.,
1995; urenjak & obrenovitch, 1998). direct support for the
idea that a combination of na+ and ca2+ channel blockade is
responsible for the neuroprotective action of betaxolol in
retinal paradigms of ischaemia/excitotoxicity comes from the
study of gross et al. (1999). they showed that betaxolol
reversibly reduced the voltage-gated sodium and calcium
currents in retinal ganglion cells and reduced the rate of
spontaneous ganglion cell ®ring induced by glutamate, while
 xxxd3377xxx , which displays a markedly inferior anity for voltagesensitive na+ and ca2+ channels relative to betaxolol had no
eect on any of these currents. indirect evidence comes from
the knowledge that na+ channel blockers, acting at either

g. chidlow et al

neurotoxin site 1 or site 2, are neuroprotective in the ischaemic
rat optic nerve model (stys et al., 1992a,b) and that betaxolol
protects against nmda-induced ganglion cell loss by a
mechanism that does not involve either b-adrenoceptor
antagonism (osborne et al., 1997) or induction of basic
®broblast growth factor expression (unpublished observations). despite the fact that propranolol cannot be used as
an antiglaucoma agent due to its undesirable eects on the
cornea, it would be interesting to determine whether the drug
aords an equivalent degree of neuroprotection in paradigms
of excitotoxicity/ischaemia to betaxolol, since the drugs
displayed similar pro®les in this study.
finally it should be stated that betaxolol is known to reach
the retina in signi®cant amounts after topical administration
(osborne et al., 1999b) and owing to its highly lipophilic
nature may well accumulate in cell membranes at sucient
quantities to interact with ion channels. as a consequence, it is
not unlikely that the reason why glaucoma patients treated
topically with betaxolol have better preserved visual ®elds than
patients treated with other b-blockers is due to the action of
betaxolol on na+ and ca2+ channels. nevertheless, without

detailed knowledge of the exact concentration of betaxolol
which accumulates in the immediate vicinity of the ganglion
cells or their axons in patients after topical administration this
theory will remain unproved.
in conclusion, this study demonstrates that betaxolol
displaces [3h]- xxxd360xxx  binding and reduces na+ in¯ux in rat
cortex. the compound is more eective than other badrenoceptor antagonists currently used in glaucoma therapy
but less potent than the combined local anaesthetic/badrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. future work is needed
to examine the eect of betaxolol and other b-adrenoceptor
antagonists on na+ channels within the retina.
