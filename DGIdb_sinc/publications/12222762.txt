abstract
we have determined the agonist activity of a number of natural prostaglandins and
prostaglandin analogs at the  xxxg1878xxx  cloned from a human ciliary body
cdna library using phosphoinositide (pi) turnover assays.  xxxd3414xxx  acid (ec50 5 3.2 6
0.6 nm) was the most potent agonist in these cells followed by  xxxd340xxx  free acid (17phenyl-trinor  xxxd1902xxx  ; ec50 5 5.8 6 2.6 nm), fluprostenol (ec50 5 6.1 6 1.5 nm), and  xxxd2446xxx  free acid (phxa85; ec50 5 54.6 6 12.4 nm) which was 17-fold weaker (p ,
0.001) than  xxxd3414xxx  acid. unoprostone and s-1033 were significantly (p , 0.001)
weaker than  xxxd3414xxx  acid. the amide prodrug,  xxxd340xxx  (ec50 5 694 6 293 nm),
activated this  xxxg1878xxx  with an intermediate potency. the isopropyl ester prodrugs,
 xxxd3414xxx  (ec50 5 42.3 6 6.7 nm),  xxxd2446xxx  (ec50 5 126 6 347 nm) and unoprostone isopropyl ester (ec50 5 9100 6 2870 nm), also exhibited fp agonist activity. however, other compounds such as pgi2, bradykinin, histamine, and serotonin were inactive.
the agonist activities of  xxxd340xxx , unoprostone (uf-021), fluprostenol and acids of
 xxxd3414xxx  and  xxxd2446xxx  were antagonized by al-8810 (11b-fluoro-15-epi-15-indanylpgf2a ), an fp-receptor-selective antagonist (ki 5 1.0 2 2.1 mm; n 5 3). these studies
have demonstrated, for the first time, agonist activities of the currently known and marketed ocular hypotensive prostaglandin analogs at the cloned human ciliary body fp
prostaglandin receptor.

introduction
prostaglandin receptor agonists of the fp-class (1,2), including  xxxd3414xxx  (3,4) and  xxxd2446xxx 
(5), are potent and efficacious intraocular pressure (iop)-lowering agents (1–5). the  xxxg1878xxx 
mrna and/or the  xxxg1878xxx  protein have been recently reported to be present in various cultured
human ocular cells, including primary trabecular meshwork cells (6), a transformed ciliary epithelial
cell line (7) and primary ciliary muscle cells (7). cynomolgus monkey ciliary body also contained
the mrna for fp receptors (8). in addition, we (9,10) and others (11) have also shown the human
313

longitudinal and circular muscles to be highly enriched in fp receptors as determined by quantitative
autoradiographic techniques. furthermore, the  xxxg1878xxx  was recently cloned from a
cdna library of human ciliary body and shown to be a member of the 7-transmembrane domain gprotein coupled receptor family (12).
even though fp prostaglandin receptors have been detected in various ocular tissues (see
above), the detailed pharmacological characterization of these receptors using a range of agonist
and antagonist(s) has not been conducted to date. indeed, only pgf 2a was used to show  xxxg1878xxx -mediated effects at the cloned human ciliary body fp receptors expressed in human kidney
cells (hek-293) (12) and in the human tm cells (6). therefore, the aims of our current studies
were: 1) to define the pharmacological properties of cloned human ciliary body-derived fp receptors transfected into hek-293 cells (hek-fp) using highly selective synthetic fp agonists such as
 xxxd3414xxx  (3,4,10),  xxxd2446xxx  (5), and their respective carboxylic acids; 2) to ascertain the agonist activity of  xxxd340xxx  (17-phenyl-trinor prostaglandin f2a ethyl amide) (13) and its free acid
(17-phenyl-trinor pgf 2a ), unoprostone (uf-021; 14) and its isopropyl ester and s-1033 (15) at this
cloned  xxxg1878xxx ; 3) to use the  xxxg1878xxx -selective antagonist, al-8810 (16,17),
to antagonize these agonist-induced functional responses to further identify the receptor as the fpsubtype.

cell culture
the human embryonic kidney cells (hek-293) transfected (stable transfections) with the fulllength human ciliary muscle  xxxg1878xxx  (hek-fp cells), a 359-amino acid protein (12), were
used between passage number 7 and 15. the cells were grown in dulbecco’s modified eagle
medium (dmem) containing 4.5 g/l glucose and 110 mg/l sodium pyruvate, supplemented with
2 mm l-glutamine, 5 u/ml penicillin and 5 (g/ml streptomycin, 1.3 mg/ml  xxxd2191xxx  and 10% fetal bovine serum. the cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% co2 and 95% air,
with two changes of fresh media weekly. for the experiments described, hek-fp cells
(50,000/well) were grown for 3–4 days to confluence in 24-well plates coated with 0.2% bovine
gelatin.

phosphoinostide turnover assays
the phosphoinositide (pi) turnover assays of phospholipase c activity were conducted as previously described and involved the measurement of agonist-stimulated production of [3h]-inositol phosphates ([3 h]-ips) by anion-exchange chromatography (18–20). briefly, confluent hek-fp cells were
exposed for 24–30 hrs at 37°c to 2.2–3.8 mci [3 h]-myo-inositol (18.3 ci/mmol) in 1.0 ml of the respective serum-free medium in order to label the cell membrane inositol-containing lipids. cells were
then rinsed once with dmem/f-12 containing 10 mm licl prior to incubation with the agonist (or
solvent vehicle as the control) in 1.0 ml of the same medium for 1 hr at 37°c. after this time, the
medium was aspirated and 1 ml of ice-cold 0.1 m  xxxd2154xxx  was added. when the antagonist effects of al-8810 were studied, al-8810 was added to the cells 15–20 min prior to exposure to the
agonists. the chromatographic separation of [3h]-ips on an  xxxd147xxx -x8 column was performed as previously described (18–20) with sequential washes of h2o and 50 mm ammonium formate, followed
by elution of the total [3 h]-ips fraction with 1.2 m ammonium formate containing 0.1 m  xxxd2154xxx .
each eluate (4 ml) was collected into a scintillation vial, mixed with 15 ml scintillation fluid, and the
total [3h]-ips determined by scintillation counting on a beckman ls6000 beta-counter.

data analysis
concentration-response data were analyzed by the sigmoidal fit function of the origin scientific
graphics software (microcal software, northampton, ma) to determine agonist potency (ec50 values) and data normalized to maximal responses induced by fluprostenol (17–20). correlation coefficients were determined for potency comparisons, and for potency and affinity comparisons, using the

316

origin software. the equilibrium antagonist potency (ki, drug dissociation constant) of al-8810 was
determined as previously described (16,17): ki 5 antagonist ic50/(1 1 [agonist concentration used/
agonist ec50]). statistical analyses were performed using the student’s unpaired t-tests.
results
an initial survey of the pi turnover mediated by various classes of prostaglandins in the hekfp cells revealed that while fp-class agents (e.g.  xxxd1902xxx  , fluprostenol,  xxxd3414xxx  acid) robustly stimulated [3 h]-ips accumulation, other agents selective for other prostaglandin receptors (e.g. pgi2 ) and
for other receptor families (e.g. histamine, bradykinin and serotonin (5-ht)) were either very weak
or were inactive in these cells (data not shown). however, non-transfected hek-293 cells did not respond to any of the fp agonists but robustly responded to the muscarinic agonist, carbachol.
various fp-class prostaglandin analogs, such as  xxxd1902xxx  ,  xxxd3414xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx  free acid,  xxxd340xxx  and its free acid,  xxxd2446xxx  and its free acid (phxa85), unoprostone isopropyl ester and
its free acid (unoprostone) and s-1033 concentration-dependently stimulated [3h]-ips production in
hek-fp cells (e.g. fig. 1). the agonist potencies (ec50) of the compounds are shown in table 1.
the rank order of potencies of the compounds in this assay was as follows:  xxxd3414xxx  acid .  xxxd340xxx  acid . fluprostenol .  xxxd1902xxx  .  xxxd3414xxx  .  xxxd2446xxx  acid . .  xxxd2446xxx  .  xxxd340xxx ™ 5  xxxd340xxx  . . s-1033 . unoprostone (uf-021) $ unoprostone isopropyl ester (table 1).
the agonist potencies of the numerous prostaglandins and prostaglandin analogs evaluated at the
cloned human ocular  xxxg1878xxx  compared very well with those obtained at the mouse (swiss 3t3
fibroblast; 18) (r 5 0.93; p , 0.0001) and those at the rat (a7r5, vascular smooth muscle cells; 19)

relative receptor binding affinities (kis) determined for various prostaglandins using [3 h]- xxxd3414xxx 
acid (10) and [3 h]-pgf 2a (10) and their functional agonist potencies in the pi assay at the cloned human ocular  xxxg1878xxx  (r 5 0.93 2 0.96; p , 0.0001) (fig. 3). for comparison purposes, preliminary studies conducted on primary human ciliary muscle cells expressing an endogenous  xxxg1878xxx  yielded the following pi turnover data:  xxxd3414xxx  acid (ec50 5 2.9 6 1.6 nm),  xxxd1902xxx  (ec50 5
100 6 43 nm) and  xxxd2446xxx  acid (ec50 5 168 6 70 nm).
the  xxxg1878xxx -antagonist, al-8810, concentration-dependently antagonized the
pi turnover mediated by  xxxd340xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx  acid,  xxxd2446xxx  acid, unoprostone and fluprostenol
via the cloned human ciliary body  xxxg1878xxx  (fig. 4; table 2).

discussion
prostaglandins and prostaglandin analogs of the fp-class, including  xxxd3414xxx ,  xxxd2446xxx  and
isopropyl esters of  xxxd1902xxx  and unoprostone lower iop in a variety of mammalian species including
cynomolgus monkeys and humans (1–5;18). although the major mechanism of action appears to involve the uveoscleral outflow of aqueous humor (1,18), the fact that fp receptors are present in the
human ciliary body (9–11) and trabecular meshwork (6) and fp agonists have numerous physiological and biochemical actions in the ciliary muscle (cm) suggests a potential for recruitment of the
conventional outflow mechanism (21) in the ocular hypotensive activity of these fp prostaglandin
analogs. the diversity of studies demonstrating  xxxg1878xxx -mediated activities in the ciliary body/cm,
for example relaxation of monkey cm (22), release of matrix metalloproteinases (23–25), production
of prostaglandins (26), intracellular ca21 -mobilization (27,28), cat cm contraction (29) and activation of mitogen activated protein kinases (hussain, s., abdel-latif, a. and sharif, n.a., unpublished
observations), strongly suggests an important role of the ciliary body  xxxg1878xxx  in the aqueous hu-

mor dynamics. the presence of the mrna for fp receptors in the cm (7), visualization of the fp
receptors by autoradiography using [3h]-pgf 2a (9,11) and [3h]- xxxd3414xxx  acid (10), the detection of
[3 h]-pgf 2a binding sites in cm homogenates (30), and the recent cloning of the  xxxg1878xxx  from
human cm cdna (12) library further support a physiologic role of the  xxxg1878xxx  in
the ciliary body.
the initial work of kunapuli et al. (12) on the cloned  xxxg1878xxx  from human ciliary body involved the determination of the functional activity of only pgf 2a and some isoprostanes at this receptor. since  xxxd1902xxx  is not a specific  xxxg1878xxx  agonist but acts also at other prostaglandin receptors (31), we decided to characterize the pharmacological properties of this receptor using a diverse
range of synthetic and highly selective fp agonists such as  xxxd3414xxx . due to the recent availability
of  xxxd340xxx  (13), we also determined the functional agonist activity of this and other prostaglandin
analogs including unoprostone isopropyl ester (14,32) and s-1033 (15) that have been claimed to
lower iop. some antagonism studies with al-8810, a selective  xxxg1878xxx  antagonist (16,17), were
also conducted to further define the fp-nature of this receptor.
our studies with the cloned human ciliary body  xxxg1878xxx  clearly showed that well-known and
selective  xxxg1878xxx  agonists like fluprostenol,  xxxd3414xxx  and  xxxd2446xxx  acids potently stimulated
pi turnover via this cloned ocular  xxxg1878xxx . the inactivity of the ip-receptor-selective agonist,
pgi2, along with inactivity of numerous non-prostanoids, indicated the fp nature of the receptor in
hek-fp cells. the pi turnover response assay in the hek-fp cells was robust and highly sensitive
since agonists of nanomolar potency (e.g.  xxxd3414xxx  acid and fluprostenol) could be easily distinguished from sub-micromolar potency agonists (e.g.  xxxd340xxx ) and from micromolar potency agonists (e.g. unoprostone and s-1033). this cloned human ocular  xxxg1878xxx  also readily distinguished
between free acids, isopropyl esters and amides of the different compounds tested. thus,  xxxd3414xxx 
acid,  xxxd2446xxx  acid and  xxxd340xxx  acid for example were more active than their corresponding
isopropyl esters (i.e.  xxxd3414xxx ,  xxxd2446xxx ) and the amide (e.g.  xxxd340xxx ). while the activity of
selective  xxxg1878xxx  agonists strongly suggested the fp-nature of this receptor, the concentration-dependent blockade of the  xxxd340xxx -,  xxxd3414xxx  acid-,  xxxd2446xxx  acid-, fluprostenol- and unoprostone-induced pi turnover by al-8810, an  xxxg1878xxx -selective antagonist (16,17), further underscored
the fp identity of this cloned human ocular receptor. the antagonist potency of al-8810 at the cloned
human ocular receptor corresponded well with that previously reported against the mouse (16,17) and
rat (16,17) fp receptors.
while  xxxd3414xxx  and  xxxd2446xxx  and their corresponding free acids are known to mediate their
pharmacological actions via the  xxxg1878xxx  (1–5), the biological actions of unopros320

tone isopropyl ester (14,32) and  xxxd340xxx  (13) are reported to be via only the so-called and uncharacterized “docosanoid” (32) and “ xxxd340xxx ” (13) receptors, respectively, without any effects at
the classic prostaglandin receptors. these hypotheses are clearly incorrect since we have shown here
and elsewhere (20,33) that unoprostone (uf-021) and unoprostone isopropyl ester bind to the  xxxg1878xxx  (20) and are agonists at the  xxxg1878xxx  in swiss 3t3 mouse fibroblast pi assays (ec50 5 726
nm; 20). furthermore, unoprostone and unoprostone isopropyl ester are agonists at the cloned human
 xxxg1878xxx  derived from the ciliary body pi assay (this study). in addition, unoprostone is a relatively potent fp agonist (ec50 5 207 nm) in the rat vascular smooth muscle cell pi turnover assay
(unpublished data). likewise, we have shown that  xxxd340xxx  (and its free acid, 17-phenyl-trinor
 xxxd1902xxx  ) also bind to the  xxxg1878xxx  ( xxxd340xxx  ki 5 6.3 mm; ref. 33) and behave as agonists at
the cloned human ciliary body  xxxg1878xxx  using both the pi turnover assay (this study)
and the [ca21 ]i-mobilization assay ( xxxd340xxx  ec50 5 2.2 2 2.9 mm; ref. 33) at the mouse  xxxg1878xxx  ( xxxd340xxx  ec50 5 2.2 2 2.7 mm; ref. 33) and at the rat  xxxg1878xxx  ( xxxd340xxx  ec50 5
1.622.7 mm; unpublished data).
in terms of the pharmacological characteristics of the cloned human ciliary body  xxxg1878xxx  as
compared to the fp receptors of other species, we can conclude that the agonist potencies are highly
correlated between the human ocular  xxxg1878xxx  and that of the mouse (swiss 3t3 cells; 18) and rat
(vascular smooth muscle cells; a7r5; 19), further substantiating the high degree of homology of the fp
receptor between these different species (31,34). the same is true for the antagonist potency of al8810 which is quite similar in the three species regardless of which agonist is used (this study; 16,17,33).
in conclusion, we have characterized the pharmacology of the cloned human ciliary body  xxxg1878xxx  using a variety of synthetic and natural prostaglandin agonists, prostaglandin analogs, and an
fp-receptor-selective antagonist, al-8810. in particular, these studies have clearly shown the fp-receptor-agonist activities of  xxxd340xxx  from two different sources (cayman chemical co. and allergan, inc.),  xxxd3414xxx ,  xxxd2446xxx , unoprostone isopropyl ester and their free acids at the human
ocular  xxxg1878xxx . the fp-nature of the functional responses induced by all these prostaglandin
analogs was confirmed by the use of al-8810, a selective fp antagonist (16,17). these conclusions
were further underscored by the high degree correlation of agonist potencies of these prostaglandin
analogs between the human, mouse and rat fp receptors and also between  xxxg1878xxx  binding affinities and functional agonist potencies.
