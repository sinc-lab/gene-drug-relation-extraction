abstract
▲ the chimaeric monoclonal antibody  xxxd286xxx 

specifically binds the  xxxg216xxx  of the interleukin-2
(il-2) receptor on activated t lymphocytes. through
competitive antagonism of il-2,  xxxd286xxx  supplements standard immunosuppressive therapy after
renal transplantation.
▲ ≤24 hours after a single intravenous dose of  xxxd286xxx  2.5 to 25mg, ≈90% of available il-2 receptors on t lymphocytes were complexed with the
drug. this level of  xxxd286xxx  binding was maintained for 4 to 6 weeks when renal transplant patients
received  xxxd286xxx  20mg 2 hours before and then
4 days after transplantation surgery.
▲ in 2 large, well-designed trials, the percentage of
patients with biopsy-confirmed acute rejection episodes after renal transplantation was significantly
lower with  xxxd286xxx  20mg (administered 2 hours
before and then 4 days after transplantation surgery;
30 or 33%, respectively) than placebo (44 or 46%)
at 6 months after surgery.
▲  xxxd286xxx  was well tolerated during clinical trials.
the incidence of infections (including active cytomegalovirus infection) and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders was similar with  xxxd286xxx 
and placebo. cytokine release syndrome was not
observed in patients who received  xxxd286xxx .

plant rejection episodes, and is normally triggered
when the cytokine interleukin-2 (il-2) binds to
the multisubunit  xxxg1175xxx  present on this cell
type.[10]  xxxd286xxx  binds with high specificity and
affinity to the  xxxg216xxx  (also known as  xxxg1174xxx 
or cd25) of the  xxxg1175xxx .[11] when complexed
with  xxxd286xxx , il-2 receptors on t lymphocytes
are not available for il-2 binding, and proliferation
of the associated cells is inhibited.[11]
• as shown in figure 1,  xxxd286xxx  concentrations ≥1 mg/l inhibited >90% of il-2 binding to
an  xxxg1175xxx -expressing t lymphocyte line in
vitro.[12] serum concentrations of  xxxd286xxx  ≥1
mg/l are readily achieved in renal transplant patients (see section 2).[11,13,14]

acute rejection occurs during the first year after
transplantation surgery in 30 to 50% of patients who
receive kidneys from living or cadaveric donors with
≥1 human leucocyte antigen (hla) mismatch.[1-3]
although acute rejection episodes frequently respond well to treatment with high-dose corticosteroids or antilymphocyte antibodies, their occurrence is
associated with a significant reduction in graft survival rates ≥5 years after transplantation.[1-3]
the standard therapies for prevention of acute
rejection episodes in renal transplant recipients are
double (cyclosporin and corticosteroids) and triple
immunosuppression (cyclosporin, corticosteroids
and azathioprine).[4]  xxxd286xxx  is a chimaeric
mouse-human monoclonal antibody which supplements these standard immunosuppressive therapies.
other supplemental therapies available include
antilymphocyte antibodies ( xxxd2676xxx  cd3 and
antithymocyte and antilymphocyte globulins),[4,5]
 xxxd1798xxx ,[6,7] tacrolimus[4,8] and mycophenolate
mofetil.[4,9]

representative patient who received  xxxd286xxx  20mg 2 hours before (day 0) and on day 4 after renal transplantation. at the indicated
time-points, the percentages of peripheral t lymphocytes with il-2 receptors available for il-2 binding were measured by flow cytometry
and serum  xxxd286xxx  concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.[12]  xxxg1175xxx  = il-2 receptors.

• the duration of  xxxg1175xxx  saturation with
 xxxd286xxx  was 29 days in paediatric renal transplant recipients (8 patients aged 2 to 12 years)
when  xxxd286xxx  12 mg/m2 was administered 2
hours before and on day 4 after surgery.[16]
other effects on the immune system

• the expression of il-2 receptors on t lymphocytes did not appear to change with  xxxd286xxx 
administration in renal transplant recipients.  xxxd286xxx  2.5 to 25mg did not down-regulate  xxxg1175xxx  expression on circulating t lymphocytes when
administered 2 hours before and on days 2, 6, 11,
17 and 24 after transplantation.[11]
•  xxxd286xxx  selectively affected activated t lymphocytes in renal transplant recipients. there were
no significant differences in total peripheral lymphocyte or lymphocyte subset (natural killer cell
and b, t helper, cytotoxic t and delta-positive t lymphocyte) counts or in the numbers of t lympho© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

who received  xxxd286xxx  2.5 to 25mg (a total of 6
infusions administered 2 hours before and on days
2, 6, 11, 17 and 24 after transplantation).[11]
• as predicted for a mouse-human chimaeric monoclonal antibody,  xxxd286xxx  was minimally immunogenic. 1 (0.4%) of 246 renal transplant recipients
developed human antibodies directed against the
variable regions of  xxxd286xxx  (anti-idiotype antibodies) 3 to 5 months after administration of the
drug (total doses of 15 to 150mg given over periods
of 1 to 4 weeks after transplantation).[17]
2. pharmacokinetic profile
• serum concentrations of  xxxd286xxx  [measured
by radioimmunoassay (ria)] generally ranged from
5 to 10 mg/l immediately after a single infusion of
15 or 20mg of the drug in renal transplant recipients.[13] serum  xxxd286xxx  concentrations declined over time in a biphasic manner (fig. 2).[12]
peak 24 hour serum  xxxd286xxx  concentrations
(measured by ria) were generally proportional to

by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa)][14,15]
and 0.7 or 1 mg/l (measured by ria)[11,13] in adult
renal transplant recipients and ≥0.2 mg/l (measured by elisa) in paediatric renal transplant recipients.[16]
• the volume of distribution (vd) of  xxxd286xxx  in the central compartment was reported to be
3.1[13] or 4.9l[14] in adults and 1.7l in children.[16]
vd did not correlate with bodyweight in adult patients (r = 0.29).[14]
• clearance was 0.017 l/h with 1 to 3 infusions
of  xxxd286xxx  15 or 20mg[13] and 0.046 l/h with a
single dose of 40mg in adult renal transplant recipients.[14] consistent with reduced vd, clearance
was 0.02 l/h in paediatric patients who received an
infusion of  xxxd286xxx  12 mg/m2 2 hours before
and on day 4 after renal transplantation.[16] clearance was not well correlated with bodyweight in
adults (r = 0.45)[14] or with bodyweight, age or
body surface area in children.[16]
• the terminal elimination half-life (t1⁄2beta) of  xxxd286xxx  in renal transplant recipients was reported
to be 13.4 days in adults (with  xxxd286xxx  15 or
20mg 2 hours before, then 1 or 2 times in the 10
days after surgery[13] and 9.4 days in children (with
12 mg/m2 of the drug 2 hours before and on day 4
after surgery).[16] these values for t1⁄2beta are markedly longer than the value reported for the mouse
monoclonal antibody  xxxd2676xxx  cd3 (1 to 2
days).[5]
3. therapeutic trials
the efficacy of  xxxd286xxx  in the prevention of
acute rejection has been evaluated in 2 multicentre,
double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in europe and canada[18,19] and the us.[15,20,21]
a total of 722 first-time recipients of renal transplants from cadaveric[15,18,20,21] or living donors[15, 20,21]
with ≥1 hla mismatch participated in the trials;

administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion
2 hours before and on day 4 after surgery, and all
patients received concomitant double immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporin microemulsion and
prednisone) throughout the study period. both trials used an intent-to-treat analysis.
• the incidence of acute rejection episodes was
significantly lower with  xxxd286xxx  than placebo
in both studies in the first 6 months after transplantation from cadaveric and living donors (fig. 3).

rejection episodes continued to be significantly
lower with  xxxd286xxx  (38% in both trials) than
placebo (55% in both trials; p ≤ 0.002).[18,20] when
only biopsy-confirmed acute rejection episodes were
considered, the incidence was 35% with  xxxd286xxx  and 49% with placebo at the 12-month timepoint in the us trial.[20]
• overall graft survival rates (range 87 to 95%),
patient survival rates (95 to 97%) and the histological severity of rejection (graded using the banff
criteria)[22] were similar at 12 months after transplantation in renal transplant recipients with  xxxd286xxx  or placebo.[18,20] the effect of  xxxd286xxx 
on ≥5-year graft and patient survival rates is not
yet known.
• in contrast to those in the total population, graft
survival rates in 2 high risk subpopulations of
renal transplant recipients, diabetic and africanamerican patients, were significantly higher with
 xxxd286xxx  than placebo.[20,23] in a combined analysis of the us and european/canadian trials, graft
survival rates in diabetic patients were 96% with
 xxxd286xxx  and 86% with placebo (p = 0.022).[23]
in african-american patients, graft survival rates
were significantly higher with  xxxd286xxx  than
placebo at the 6-month time-point in the us trial
(100 vs 92%, respectively, p = 0.041); the difference reached borderline significance at the 12month time-point (98 vs 88%, p = 0.059).[20]
• renal function after transplant was significantly
better in patients who received  xxxd286xxx  than in
those who received placebo in the us trial, on the
basis of the percentage of patients who produced
urine in the operating theatre (94 vs 87%, respectively), incidence of delayed graft function (15 vs
23%) and mean creatinine clearance during the
first 12 months after transplantation (except at the
12-week time-point).[20] in contrast, mean creatinine clearance was similar in patients who received
 xxxd286xxx  or placebo at all time-points in the
european/canadian trial.[18]

mofetil) was significantly lower in patients who
received  xxxd286xxx  than in placebo recipients 6
and 12 months after transplantation.[18,20] during
the first 6 months after transplantation, 10% of patients who received  xxxd286xxx  experienced corticosteroid-resistant first rejection episodes compared
with 23% of placebo recipients in the european/canadian trial (p < 0.001);[18] 24% of  xxxd286xxx  versus 39% of placebo recipients experienced such
episodes in the us trial (p = 0.003).[21]
• median total direct medical costs per patient
(including hospitalisations, outpatient visits, medical procedures, laboratory and diagnostic tests
and medications other than  xxxd286xxx ) were calculated to be significantly lower with  xxxd286xxx 
($us26 479) than with placebo ($us32 241, p =
0.03) in the us trial; the difference was related to
differences in the incidences of acute rejection, use
of antibody therapy to treat rejection and hospitalisation for rejection.[24]
4. tolerability
• acute adverse events suggestive of hypersensitivity were not reported in patients who received
 xxxd286xxx ,[11,13,14,18,20] except for 1 patient who
experienced transient facial flushing during an
infusion in a noncomparative trial; the infusion
was completed without further incident.[11] there
were no reports of cytokine release syndrome
(manifested as fever and chills and observed in
most patients who receive  xxxd2676xxx  cd3)[4] in
comparative[18,20] and noncomparative[11,13,14] clinical trials of  xxxd286xxx .
• infections (bacterial, viral, fungal and unspecified) occurred at similar rates in patients who received  xxxd286xxx  or placebo; respective rates
were 75 or 73% in the us and 85 or 86% in the
european/canadian trial.[18,20] cytomegalovirus infections occurred with similar frequencies in  xxxd286xxx  and placebo recipients; the respective incidences were 21 and 27% in the european/canadian
trial[18] and 7 and 9% in the us trial.[20]
• post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders[25]
occurred in 0.3% (1 patient) of a total of 363

 xxxd286xxx  recipients and 0.6% (2 patients) of 359
placebo recipients in the 12 months after transplant
in the european/canadian and us clinical trials;
the epstein-barr virus status of patients was not
reported.[15,18] in these 2 trials, a total of 13 patients
(2%; 5  xxxd286xxx  and 8 placebo recipients) developed malignancies (adenocarcinoma, basal cell
carcinoma, breast carcinoma, melanoma, cerebral
glioma, hypernephroma, kaposi’s sarcoma, lymphoma, multiple myeloma and squamous cell carcinoma) in the first 12 months after transplant.[18,20]
• in clinical trials of  xxxd286xxx , vital signs or
clinical laboratory test values did not differ significantly between  xxxd286xxx  and placebo recipients
at any time-point, with the exception of creatinine
levels and clearance (see section 3).[18,20]
5.  xxxd286xxx : current status
 xxxd286xxx  is a chimaeric mouse-human monoclonal antibody which inhibits t lymphocyte proliferation by antagonising il-2 binding to its receptor.
in combination with standard double immunosuppressive therapy, this drug has shown clinical efficacy in reducing the incidence of acute renal transplant rejection in 2 large, well-designed clinical
trials.  xxxd286xxx  has been approved in the us and
european community, and is being investigated for
prevention of rejection of liver transplants.[26-28]
