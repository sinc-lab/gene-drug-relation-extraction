to assess the efficacy of exemestane as neoadjuvant treatment, 55 postmenopausal women (mean age: 76 years; range: 66 – 86) with
oestrogen-positive non-metastatic breast tumour and ineligible for conservative surgery were recruited into this phase ii trial to
receive oral exemestane (25 mg day1) for 6 months. tumour response was evaluated by clinical examination, mammography and
breast ultrasound every 2 months (recist criteria). overall clinical response to treatment was observed in 33/54 patients (61.1%;
95% ci: 48.1 – 74.0). radiological responses in 45 evaluable patients were partial response in 23, stable disease in 21 and disease
progression in one. median time to surgery from the commencement of treatment was 7 months; conservative surgery in 24 patients
(55.8%) and mastectomy in 19 patients (34.5%); no surgery (patient choice or considered not suitable by attending physician) in 12
patients. pathologic complete response was observed in breast and axilla in one patient (2.3%) and different forms of persistent
disease in 23 (53.5%) patients. treatment tolerance was good. no patient withdrew from the study because of toxic events. we
conclude that exemestane as a primary treatment is feasible and very active in elderly patients with large-sized breast cancer tumour.
conservative surgery is feasible in responding patients. no severe adverse events were detected. the optimal hormonal treatment
schedule remains to be determined.

breast cancer incidence increases with age; one-third of patients
being 465 years of age when diagnosed (landis et al, 1998).
further, the diagnosis of large volume tumours is most frequent in
the elderly women. this observation is not because the tumour is
biologically more aggressive at such an age but rather because, in
many cases, these patients put off visiting their family practitioner
or local medical centre and, as well, decline to participate in
population screening programmes (yancik et al, 1989).
the primary treatment for breast cancer has been to treat both
operable and non-operable large size tumours, as well as to
provide the patients with a conservative treatment option.
randomised trials have shown that this approach achieves this
objective in a high proportion of cases, whereas diseasefree-survival (dfs) and overall survival (os) are maintained

fisher et al, 1998; moneer et al, 1999; mauri et al, 2005).
primary hormonal treatment is the appropriate option for
treating postmenopausal women who have hormone-receptorpositive advanced tumours. the first trials were performed using
tamoxifen as a single medical treatment, as opposed to surgery.
a reduction in tumour size was noted in a remarkable proportion
of patients (gazet et al, 1994; ellis et al, 2001).
third-generation aromatase inhibitors rely on antitumour
activity, superior to that of tamoxifen, in treating disseminated
breast cancer in postmenopausal women. similarly, letrozole
appears to have a better activity profile than that of tamoxifen in
the treatment of primary breast cancer (eiermann et al, 2001; ellis
et al, 2001). in elderly women, primary hormonal treatment is
considered the most appropriate option to avoid mutilation
resulting from radical surgery. tolerability of these drugs is
acceptable, with only a small percentage of patients abandoning
the therapy. the probability of achieving a better response is
increased in relation to the level of  xxxg730xxx  (er)
expression (ellis et al, 2001).
exemestane, a steroid aromatase inhibitor, has a better
antitumour activity than tamoxifen in the treatment of disseminated breast cancer, and with a low incidence of secondary adverse
effects (dixon et al, 2003; paridaens et al, 2003). the initial results

patients and methods
between november 2000 and june 2003, there were 55 patients
recruited from seven spanish institutions. the study was approved
by the ethics committees of each institution. before the patients
were recruited into the study, informed consent was obtained from
each participant on the understanding that the data from the trial
would be used in determining the factors predictive of response
while maintaining anonymity of the individual participants. all the
patients fulfilled the following eligibility criteria: histological
confirmation of breast carcinoma; nuclear staining of oestrogen
receptors in x50% of tumour cells assessed with immunohistochemistry (ihc) techniques; x65 years of age; and measurable
disease in at least one dimension of the tumour; and any of the
following clinical conditions to be ineligible for breast conservative
surgery according the criteria of the surgical team and tumour size
x3 cm or tumour stage t4a, t4b, n1 or n2. patients needed to have
a karnofsky index x70; appropriate haematological, hepatic and
renal function and a life expectancy of at least 6 months. the
exclusion criteria included being male; previous treatment with
tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors; inflammatory carcinoma or
ulceration on the mammary glands 450% of the volume; previous
malignancy (except basocellular carcinoma or cervical carcinoma
in situ appropriately treated); and distant metastases. the
administration of other antineoplasic therapies and hormonal
replacement treatment (hrt) were not permitted within the trial
protocol.

treatment scheme
the patients received 25 mg exemestane orally once daily
( xxxd2075xxx , pfizer spain) for a period of 6 months, unless disease
progression was observed. surgical treatment was scheduled for
when this treatment period was completed, and exemestane was
administered until the day before surgery. depending on
radiological and clinical findings at the conclusion of the treatment
with exemestane, patients in whom it was considered possible were
offered conservative treatment. according to the protocol of each
participating institution, the patients subsequently received
supplementary radiotherapy always on the mammary gland when
conservative treatment had been performed, or on the thoracic
wall and extended to the lymph nodes in case of locally advanced
disease, or when three or more lymph nodes were involved.
& 2009 cancer research uk

following surgery, most patients on hormone therapy with no
progression of the disease proceeded on to adjuvant systemic
treatment with exemestane for a period of 5 years.

study assessments
all patients had histological confirmation by means of core needle
biopsy, and, from which tissue, progesterone and er status was
determined using ihc techniques. her2 expression was evaluated
using herceptestt (dako a/s, glostrup, denmark, http://www.
dakousa.com/prod_downloadpackageinsert.pdf?objectid ¼ 114969002).
the expression of p53 proteins as well as bcl-2 and  xxxg251xxx  (using
antibodies against p53, ab2 and ab-6, respectively) was assessed
using ihc techniques. apoptosis was measured using the tunnel
technique (4 or o1%). all immunochemistry and histological
determinations were reviewed by a single investigator of the team
(am) who was blinded with respect to the clinical course of the
disease. before the start of treatment, the patients underwent the
following evaluations: physical examination, haemogramme and
blood biochemistry constituents, including renal function and liver
enzymes, bilateral mammography, chest x-ray, bone scan and
abdominal echography. the diameter of every lesion was
measured, and in case of suspected adenopathies determined on
palpation, these were confirmed by cytology on tissue obtained by
biopsy. pathology examination was performed by a pathologist of
each institution, who was provided with tumour assessment
guidelines, following the criteria proposed by the aberdeen group
(walker et al, 1999) before starting the trial. patients without
residual infiltrating cancer or dcis in the breast and in the axilla
were considered to have had a pathological complete remission,
and status was reviewed by one investigator (am). the follow-up
evaluation comprising physical examination, mammography and/
or breast echography commenced at 1-month post-treatment and
continued every 2 months thereafter. the recist methodology
was used to assess response (therasse et al, 2000). after surgery,
the patients were followed-up every 6 months. blood chemistries,
chest x-rays and mammographies were performed annually. in
case of disease progression during the primary hormone treatment
stage, the patient was transferred out of the trial and subsequent
treatment was left to the discretion of the individual investigator.
tolerance to treatment was assessed according to the methodology described by the nih (nih, 1998).

statistical methods
the design of the study was according to simon’s method in which
the desired minimum activity was defined as 20% and the
maximum was 40%. assuming an a-error of 0.05 and a b-error
of 0.1, the minimum number of patients required was estimated as
19 and the maximum as 54. the two-stage model was chosen with
the purpose of terminating the trial if a minimum of four objective
responses was not obtained out of the 19 patients. if such an index
corresponded to 15 out of the first 19 patients, the study would be
terminated as well. if none of these possibilities occurred, the study
would continue until 54 patients had been recruited.
the progression-free survival was calculated from the moment
of the patient’s inclusion until progression occurred. response
duration was calculated from the time of detection of response
until disease progression. overall survival was estimated from the
time of the patient’s inclusion into the trial until death from any
cause. values are expressed as odds ratio (or) and 95%
confidence interval (95%ci). significance level was set at po0.05.

results
this study included a total of 55 women. of these, 54 were
evaluable for assessment of response and toxicity, and one patient

clinical studies

of a small scale phase ii study suggested that exemestane,
administered as primary treatment for locally advanced breast
tumour, is capable of reducing tumour size in around 84% of
patients (miller and dixon, 2002). a randomised phase ii trial
comparing primary chemotherapy with primary endocrine treatment has recently published (semiglazov et al, 2007). the results
show a similar effect in overall objective response to the two
treatments and to breast conservation surgery in postmenopausal
women with positive  xxxg1603xxx . however, in this trial, the
primary treatment was administered only for 3 months.
we present the results of a phase ii study, which was performed
with exemestane as primary hormonal treatment in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer, and with a receptor-positive
tumour of x3 cm. the primary objective was to evaluate (using
physical examination and imaging techniques including echography and mammography) the effectiveness of exemestane as a
primary treatment administered for 6 months. the secondary
objectives were to assess the proportion of patients who could
benefit from a conservative treatment, and to histologically
evaluate remission rates, the tolerability profile and the time-toprogression of the disease. various clinical factors and molecular
markers were evaluated in relation to the response-to-treatment
achieved.

withdrew her consent to further participation after the first 24 h of
treatment. at the time of inclusion, all patients were ineligible for
conservative surgery, according to the surgical team’s criteria. half
of patients had locally advanced disease. the patients’ characteristics are summarised in table 1. following 6 months of treatment,
an objective clinical response was observed in 33 patients (global
index: 61.1%; 95%ci: 48.1 – 74%); complete clinical remission was
achieved in three patients (5.5%; 95% ci: 0 – 11.5%) and partial
remission in 30 patients (55.5%; 95% ci: 42.3 – 68.2%). stabilisation was observed in 19 patients that represents 35.1% of patients
who began primary treatment with exemestane. local disease
progression without metastases was observed in two patients
(3.7%; 95%ci: 0 – 8.7%); one after the 4th month, and the other
after the 6th month of the treatment. the first patient had her2positive tumour, whereas in the other her2 overexpression was
not present. on progression, these patients had chemotherapy
administered and subsequent surgery. the clinical benefit
obtained was around 96.1%.

end of the treatment period. figure 1 depicts the mammography

one of the secondary objectives of the study was to evaluate the
type and effect of surgery after 6 months of treatment. there were
11 patients who were not operated upon; in eight cases the patients
refused the surgical option despite having had a partial remission
or stabilisation with a good tolerance to the medication; two cases
with local disease progression had chemotherapy before the
surgical intervention; one case was not referred for surgery
because of medical contraindications to anaesthesia. hence, 43
women underwent breast surgery; 24 patients (55.8%) had a
lumpectomy and 19 patients (44.2%) had a mastectomy (in some
cases such surgery was specifically requested by the patient). an
axilla lymphadenectomy was performed in 36 of the 43 patients
undergoing surgery (table 3).
with respect to pathological remissions in one case (2.3%;
95%ci: 0 – 6.7%), the remission was ganglionar and locally
complete, the histological type was an infiltrating lobular
carcinoma; in 23 cases (53.5%; 95%ci: 33.1 – 73.8%), there were
signs of inflammation, necrosis and fibrosis with presence of local
small infiltrating ducal carcinoma nests; and in 19 cases (44.1%),
no evidence of local histological response was observed (table 3).
analysis of the factors predictive of response included age,
tumour size, er level, general clinical status and presence or
absence of axilla lymph node involvement. only the presence of er
x90% was statistically significantly associated with radiological
response rate (73 vs 32%; p ¼ 0.0026; or: 5.7, 95% ci: 1.7 – 18.5).
age (p76 vs 476 years), tumour size (t2 – t3 vs t4), karnofsky
index (o100 vs 100%) and axilla involvement (n0 vs n1 – n2)
showed no significant relationship with radiological response.
her2 overexpression was detected in eight cases (14.5%), and
tunnel 41% was detected in 13% of the patients. her2, bcl-2,
 xxxg251xxx , bax and p53 expression were not significantly related to
the clinical response. the small number of patients precluded
significant correlations between these variables being detected.
tolerance to treatment was good during the presurgical
treatment phase. however, two cases had transient cerebral
vascular ischaemia during the adjuvant treatment. no other grade
iii or iv toxicity was detected. there were no withdrawals from the
study due to the treatment. the main secondary effects are
summarised in table 4. notably, all secondary effects were of low
intensity and were quickly resolved.
following surgery, the patients were followed up for an average
of 48 months (range: 10 – 72) during which time 15 deaths

discussion
surgical treatment plays an important role in the management of
most cases of mammary neoplasms. when breast lesions are small
in size, a treatment conserving the mammary gland is possible,
with good cosmetic results, good acceptance by the woman and
without an additional risk of recurrence or mortality (gazet et al,
1994; eiermann et al, 2001; ebctcg 2005). when breast tumours
are large sized, generally 44 cm, radical mastectomy is the
recommended treatment. this has a higher morbidity risk and,
above all, a greater negative impact on women who have the
& 2009 cancer research uk

disease. in the case of elderly women, mastectomy is tantamount to
mutilation and the emotional impact is as strong as in younger
women. patients 470 years of age also have a tendency to prefer
breast-conserving surgery over mastectomy (sandison et al, 1996).
some investigators have compared local relapse rates following
conservative treatment in patients above and below the age of 65
years. their reports indicate 4% relapse rate  xxxd1891xxx  years in patients
aged 465 years compared to 13% in those below this age
(merchant et al, 1995). further, tolerance to radiotherapy is no
worse in the elderly than in the younger patients. therefore, age
should not be an exclusion criterion for conservative surgery.
when offering conservative surgery to those patients whose
tumour at diagnosis is of a size that implies inoperability, primary
treatment before surgery needs to be administered. randomised
primary hormone therapy or chemotherapy studies have not been
able to show a benefit regarding a reduction of mortality risk due
to cancer. however, they have shown an increase in the number of
patients in whom radical surgery on the breast can be avoided
(yancik et al, 1989; mauriac et al, 1990; bonadonna et al, 1990;
gazet et al, 1994; veronesi et al, 1995; fisher et al, 1998; usnci,
1998; moneer et al, 1999; mauri et al, 2005).
in postmenopausal patients, primary hormonal treatment with
tamoxifen has shown high effectiveness in achieving the previously
defined goals. tamoxifen has, over many years, achieved response
rates ranging from 30 to 60% (allan et al, 1985; horobin et al, 1991;
bergman et al, 1995; keen et al, 1997; gil et al, 2001), and, as such,
avoiding radical surgery in a high proportion of elderly patients. all
the studies observed a very low progression rate, ranging between 5
and 8% (smith, 1991), but, on extended follow-up, most patients had
local progression and needed some radiotherapy or surgical
treatment (robertson et al, 1992; kenny et al, 1998). some studies
have observed an average duration, 24–30 months, of response to
primary hormonal treatment (smith, 1991).
in several randomised trials (gazet et al, 1988; kenny et al,
1998), the overall survival in patients 470 years of age was similar
when the effectiveness of tamoxifen as a single treatment was
compared with surgery. however, local control was better among
the group of patients who had been operated upon. two further
randomised trials have been conducted comparing tamoxifen
monotherapy and surgery followed by tamoxifen in patients 470
years of age. with an average follow-up period of 5 years, both
studies concluded that the group treated with surgery presented
less local progressions/relapses, although the overall survival of
patients 473 years of age was approximately the same.
conservative surgery achieved the same results as mastectomy
for local control (bates et al, 1991; mustacchi et al, 1994). hence,

surgery appears not to have a great influence on survival of those
patients 473 years of age who have tumours with positive
hormonal receptors.
aromatase inhibitors have been shown to have greater activity
than tamoxifen in the first-line treatment of disseminated breast
cancer (buzdar and howell, 2001; paridaens et al, 2003; wong and
ellis, 2004). similarly, a double-blind randomised study showed
the superiority of primary treatment with letrozole vs tamoxifen
over 4 months in postmenopausal women. the overall response
rate achieved with letrozole was 60 vs 41% with tamoxifen
(eiermann et al, 2001; ellis et al, 2001). the double blind impact
study (smith et al, 2005) compared the administration of
anastrozole vs tamoxifen over a period of 3 months. no differences
were observed in the response rates (27% vs 36%), although
patients assigned to the anastrozole arm showed a greater response
rate to conservative surgery (67 vs 56%). the proact study
(cataliotti et al, 2004) also used a randomised double-blind
methodology to compare anastrozole with tamoxifen administered
over 3 months in locally advanced breast carcinoma. significant
differences in response rates were not observed (39 vs 35%), but a
greater proportion of patients treated with anastrozole benefited
from conservative surgery. the preliminary results of a small
randomised study (semiglazov et al, 2005), which was not double
blind and which compared exemestane with tamoxifen treatment
over 3 months, showed an objective clinical remission rate of
around 76% compared to 40% with tamoxifen. however, in
another german phase ii study (astner et al, 2004) containing 29
patients in whom exemestane had been administered for 4 months,
the clinical response rate was approximately 37%.
in a randomised trial comparing four cycles of adriamycin and
paclitaxel with anastrozole or exemestane administered over 3
months, a similar objective response was reported together with
low breast-conserving surgery rates plus endocrine therapy
(semiglazov et al, 2007). further, the clinical response rates were
similar to that obtained in this study.
the probability of achieving a better response has been related
to the level of hormonal receptors. in the study by ellis et al (2001),
higher response was observed when the allred score was 45, or
when percentage of er-positive cells were x50% (gil et al, 2001).
to avoid including patients with a lower probability of response to
hormonal treatment over 6 months, the er expression cutoff
x50% was introduced as an inclusion criteria.
several groups have observed discordance in response rates,
depending on the method used for response evaluation. for
example, physical examination tends to be associated with an
increase in the proportion of remissions observed, compared to
mammary echography or mammography, the latter two assessments being more concordant (eiermann et al, 2001; ellis et al,
2001; semiglazov et al, 2005). this study confirmed that response
assessments performed radiologically were not concordant with
physical examination. we believe that, among the subgroup of
elderly patients, mammography is the most useful and reliable
method except in those specific cases where tumour outlines
cannot be defined accurately by baseline mammography. in such
cases, echography would be the preferred method to assess the
response to treatment (table 5).
although the optimum time period for hormonal treatment has
not been extensively explored, some studies suggest that the
maximum response is obtained during the first 3 – 4 months of
treatment, whereas other investigators state that 49 months can
elapse before a response is achieved (allan et al, 1985; gil et al,
2001; krainick-strobel et al, 2008). in this study, a preoperative
treatment period of 6 months was proposed. this follows from
earlier experience with  xxxd3402xxx  in which patients were referred
to surgery at the time of maximum response and in which followup was every 3 months; the median time necessary to document a
response according to uicc criteria (gil et al, 2002) was 6 months.
studies performed with primary chemotherapy over 6 months
british journal of cancer (2009) 100(3), 442 – 449

have shown greater pathologic complete remission rates compared
to studies using 3-month designs. in this study, we performed a
radiological assessment of the response on a bimonthly basis. we
need to emphasise that of the 23 cases showing partial mammographic remission, only 4 had achieved this response within 2
months, as compared to 14 cases in whom the response occurred
after 4 months and 23 cases in whom the response occurred after 6
months. the impact and proact studies employed only 3
months of treatment before surgery. both reported lower response
rates relative to other studies in which aromatase inhibitors, as
well as tamoxifen, had been administered. these data suggest that
the minimum duration of the primary hormonal treatment should
be 4 months, although a longer time period might be advisable.
this hypothesis needs to be validated in a randomised clinical trial
format.
one of objectives of the primary treatment was to offer a
conservative treatment to patients in whom the initial volume of
the disease would not normally permit this option. aromatase
inhibitors have provided an improvement in this respect, such that
in randomised studies comparing these drugs with tamoxifen,
448% of patients were able to benefit from the conservative
treatment option. this percentage is greater than that observed
with tamoxifen alone (gazet et al, 1994; ellis et al, 2001; astner
et al, 2004; cataliotti et al, 2004; smith et al, 2005; semiglazov et al,
2005). in this study at the end of the treatment, 56% of the patients
who accepted the surgical option were acceptable for conservative
treatment. of note is the clinical evolution of patients who chose
not to undergo surgical treatment, that is, on many occasions
elderly women who observe an improvement in their lesions are
fearful of surgery. they choose not to undergo surgery even after
being informed of the risk of disease progression, both at a
locoregional level and in the form of metastases. on the other
hand, some patients preferred to undergo a mastectomy to avoid
later radiotherapy, even though they had responded to primary
treatment.
there have been very few studies on the effectiveness of
hormone therapy compared with chemotherapy. an earlier
randomised study by the eortc contained 410 patients with
locally advanced breast carcinoma. the study scheme compared
radiotherapy alone vs radiotherapy plus cmf chemotherapy, or
radiotherapy plus tamoxifen or radiotherapy plus cmf plus
tamoxifen (bartelink et al, 1997). the group of patients receiving
chemotherapy plus hormone therapy was the only group that
achieved a significantly higher progression-free survival. when the
chemotherapy arm was compared with the no-chemotherapy arm,
no significant differences were observed. however, the comparison
of patients receiving tamoxifen vs no tamoxifen showed significant
differences. more recently, data have been reported (semiglazov
et al, 2007) from a randomised study comparing primary
chemotherapy with doxorubicin plus paclitaxel vs primary
hormone therapy with anastrozole or exemestane. no significant
differences were observed with respect to either the clinical or
radiological response rates.
in primary chemotherapy, achieving a complete pathologic
response is associated with a better prognosis (yancik et al, 1989;
bonadonna et al, 1990; mauriac et al, 1990; veronesi et al, 1995;
usnci, 1998; mauri et al, 2005), but whether this is the same for
hormone therapy is not known. in the series of patients treated
with primary hormone therapy, the percentage of patients having a
pathologic complete remission was never 45%. indeed, in the
randomised study (ellis et al, 2001; eiermann et al, 2001)
conducted with letrozole, the percentage of histological complete
remission was 1%, and in the randomised study using anastrozole
(smith et al, 2005), the pathologic complete remission rate had not
been described. in the study performed by astner et al (2004), no
complete remission was observed. however, a reduction of the
tumour size was noted in a large proportion of patients. in this
study, the incidence of pathologic complete remission was

observed in 1 of 43 patients who underwent surgery, and

with respect to factors predictive of response to neoadjuvant or
primary hormonal treatment, er expression was the most powerful predictor in almost all studies published to date. most of these
studies (ellis et al, 2001; miller et al, 2003) suggest that an allred’s
index 45 is associated with a better response to primary hormone
therapy. consensus is not so clear with respect to progesterone
receptors, even though in some studies, they have been observed to
be a statistically significant predictive factor (smith, 1991; kenny
et al, 1998; ellis et al, 2001). in our study, er expression x90% in
tumour cells was observed to have a significantly higher
radiological response rate (73% vs 32%; p ¼ 0.0026), whereas age,
tumour size, karnofsky index and axillary ganglion status showed
no statistically significant relationship with response rate.
the expression of her2 oncogene has traditionally been
associated with resistance to treatment with tamoxifen. however,
a greater probability of response to aromatase inhibitors has been
observed, and a decrease in their expression has been related to a
greater therapeutic effect of these inhibitors (ellis et al, 2001;
eiermann et al, 2001; ellis, 2004). however, no significant
relationship was observed with her2 overexpression and the
progression of the disease. in our series, the small number of
patients with her2 overexpression precluded the detection of
significant correlations.
in some trials, changes have been noted in apoptosis markers,
such as that identified by the tunnel technique or bcl-2
expression. although these changes were not associated with a
greater probability of pathologic response (keen et al, 1997; miller
et al, 2003), the decline in proliferative activity caused by
aromatase inhibitors is likely to reduce the process of apoptosis
(buzdar and howell, 2001; zhu et al, 2004).
in our study, tolerance to exemestane was good and no patient
withdrew because of the treatment’s side effects. the only grade iii–
iv toxicities occurred in 1 case of musculoskeletal pain and two cases
of cerebrovascular accident (cva). the other toxicities were slight
and easily resolved and were similar to other studies (chang et al,
2000; ellis et al, 2001; eiermann et al, 2001; gil et al, 2002; paridaens
et al, 2003; semiglazov et al, 2005; smith et al, 2005).
following surgery, the patients continued receiving systemic
treatment with exemestane, except in the cases of disease progres-

sion. although the continued administration was not agreed by
consensus among the investigators, the results of the atac study
(atac, 2008), the big 1–98 study (coates et al, 2007), and
especially the ies 031 study (coombes et al, 2004), and the arno
study (kaufmann et al, 2007) endorse such administration. the
results from other studies currently being conducted are awaited.

conclusions
the results of our phase ii study assessing the administration of
exemestane for 6 months as primary hormonal treatment in
postmenopausal patients with er ( þ ) tumours sized 43 cm
endorse such administration as being an effective and well
tolerated, and is a treatment that makes conservative surgery
possible in a high percentage of patients. to the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study where a longer than usual
administration scheme was used without involving a greater risk of
progression of the tumour, or a decrease in the conservative
treatment option. our hypotheses need to be validated in
randomised studies exploring the optimal duration of exemestane
administration. it is also necessary to identify other predictive
factors, apart from the hormonal receptors and  xxxg721xxx  overexpression, so as to select those patients who can best benefit from
this therapeutic approach. other lines of current research seek to
increase the effectiveness of aromatase inhibitors as neoadjuvant
treatment by combining them with drugs acting on other
therapeutic targets.
