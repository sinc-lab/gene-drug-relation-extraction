abstract
the present study was designed to determine the in vitro affinity profile of (r)-(-)- xxxd1894xxx  and (s)-(+)- xxxd1894xxx 
at muscarinic receptor subtypes using both functional and binding assays. in addition, the racemate was investigated in functional
studies. the functional musearinic receptors studied were putative m 1 receptors in rabbit vas deferens and rat duodenum, m 2
receptors in guinea-pig left atria and rabbit vas deferens, as well as m 3 receptors in guinea-pig ileum and trachea. furthermore,
the histamine h 1 antagonism by (r)-(-)- and (s)-(+)- xxxd1894xxx  has been examined in guinea-pig ileum. muscarinic binding
selectivity was assessed in homogenates from human neuroblastoma nb-ok 1 cells (m1), rat heart (m2), pancreas ( m 3) and
striatum ( m 4 ) . the results demonstrate that (s)-(+)- xxxd1894xxx  is a potent m2-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist
(pa 2 = 7.86/7.74; pk i = 7.5'8) with lower affinities for the muscarinic m 1 ( p a 2 = 6 . 8 3 / 6 . 3 6 ; p k i = 7.08), the m 3 (pa2 =
6 . 9 2 / 6 . 9 6 ; p k i = 6.70) and t]he m4 receptors ( p g i --- 7.00), respectively. the (s)-( +)-enantiomer was more potent (up to 41-fold)
than the (r)-(-)-enantiomer in all muscarinic assays. in contrast, the stereoselectivity was inverse at histamine ha receptors, the
(r)-(-)-enantiomer being the eutomer (pa e = 9.42; pa2/(s)-isomer = 7.48). in conclusion, (s)-(+)- xxxd1894xxx  is a useful
tool to investigate muscarinic receptor heterogeneity. in addition, this lipophilic compound might become the starting point for
the development of m2-selective muscarinic receptor antagonists useful as diagnostic tools for quantifying muscarinic m 2
receptors in the central nervous system with positron emission tomography imaging, and to test the hypothesis that muscarinic
m 2 receptor antagonists show beneficial effects in the treatment of cognitive disorders.

1. introduction
a large body of evidence derived from both functional and radioligand binding studies suggests that
there are at least four pharmacological muscarinic receptor subtypes, termed i~i1, m2, m 3 and m 4 receptors. molecular biology studies suggest that at least five
genes encoding muscarinic receptor subtypes ( m l - m 5 )
are expressed in mammalian tissues. comparison of

the location, antagonist binding properties and functional coupling of the native muscarinic m 1 - m 4 receptors with those of the expressed m l - m 4 proteins
showed a good correlation. a functional equivalent of
the m5 gene product has yet to be identified. this
subclassification of muscarinic receptors is based primarily on the relative sensitivities of the receptor subtypes to key muscarinic antagonists such as  xxxd2965xxx 
(m1 > m4 > m3 > m2), ll-[[2-[(diethylamino)-methyl]1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6h- xxxd3047xxx -[2,3-b][1,4]-benzodiazepin-6-one (af-dx 116) and related
compounds, methoctramine and himbacine (m 2 > m 4
> m 1 > m 3) as well as hexahydro-sila- xxxd1907xxx  and its
p-fluoro derivative (m 3 > m 1 >__m 4 > m2; for recent
reviews, see hulme et al., 1990; levine and birdsall,

1993, 1995; caulfield, 1993). in addition, muscarinic
receptors may be differentiated on the basis of their
stereoselectivity to chiral antagonists (feifel et al., 1990;
waelbroeck et al., 1992; d6rje et al., 1991).
muscarinic m 2 receptors have been reported to be
depleted in post-mortem brains from patients with
alzheimer's disease (aubert et al., 1992). this has
raised the necessity of developing m2-selective muscarinic receptor antagonists, capable of penetrating
into the central nervous system, that could be useful
both as diagnostic tools for quantifying the loss of
muscarinic m 2 receptors with positron emission tomography imaging (dewey et al., 1990), and as therapeutic agents (gitler et al., 1992). the muscarinic m 2
receptor in hippocampal and cortical tissues has been
shown to function as an inhibitory autoreceptor, the
inhibition of which enhances acetylcholine release
(doods et al., 1993). selective blockade of these muscarinic m 2 receptors in still existing neurons might
therefore be a viable means of reversing the cholinergic hypofunction and the resulting cognitive impairments in patients with alzheimer's disease (gitler et
al., 1992; doods et al., 1993). however, the 'm2-selective' key muscarinic receptor antagonists (see above) as
well as compounds recently discovered such as tripitramine (melchiorre et al., 1993; maggio et al., 1994),
imperialine ( xxxd1704xxx  et al., 1992) and its 3-a-chloro
derivative (baumgold et al., 1994), and 5-[[4-[4-(diethylamino)butyl]-l-piperidinyl]acetyl]-10,11-dihydro-5h-dibenzo[b,e] [1,4] xxxd1866xxx -ll-one (diba; gitler et al.,
1992; cohen et al., 1993) suffer from clear limitations
(see discussion).
racemic  xxxd1894xxx  maleate is a widely used
histamine h 1 receptor antagonist capable of crossing
the blood-brain barrier (nicholson et al., 1991; casy et
al., 1992; cicurel et al., 1992). it contains a chiral
centre which results in the existence of two enantiomers (fig. 1). borchard et al. (1985) reported that
the (r)-enantiomer (pa 2 = 9.1) proved to be 20-fold
more potent at histamine h1 receptors in guinea-pig
ileum than the (s)-isomer (pa 2 = 7.8). this has been
confirmed in binding studies at peripheral and central
histamine h a receptors (ter laak et al., 1993). the
higher histamine h 1 receptor antagonism by (r)- xxxd1894xxx  was subsequently confirmed in vivo, both
in animal and in human studies (nicholson et al., 1991;
leuschner et al., 1992; cicurel et al., 1992). antimuscarinic activity has been reported for racemic  xxxd1894xxx  maleate which inhibited the contractile responses to carbachol in guinea-pig ileum (sautel et al.,
1992; pa2=6.7). in addition, competition binding
studies at muscarinic receptors in bovine frontal cortex
using the non-selective radioligand [3h]3-quinuclidinyl
benzilate showed that (s)- xxxd1894xxx  binds with
higher affinity to muscarinic receptors (k i = 0.9 /xm)
than the (r)-isomer (k i = > 10/zm) (nicholson et al.,

1991). however, the affinity profile of (r)- and (s)- xxxd1894xxx  at clearly defined muscarinic receptor subtypes m1-m 4 has never been investigated.
thus, the aim of the present study was to examine
the affinity of the enantiomers of  xxxd1894xxx  at
muscarinic receptor subtypes m1-m 4 in functional (including the racemate) as well as in binding studies. in
addition, the antagonism by the enantiomers of  xxxd1894xxx  was studied at histamine h 1 receptors.
preliminary accounts of these results have been published (lambrecht et al., 1994, 1995; pfaff et al., 1994).

2. materials and methods
the muscarinic receptor subtypes present in the
preparations used in this paper are summarized in
table 1, and the methods used have been described in
detail previously (table 1). in all functional preparations, control experiments established that there was
no consistent sensitivity change to the agonists used
over the normal experiment duration.
2.1. functional studies
rat duodenum
experiments on intact rat duodenum were carried
out according to micheletti et al. (1987). briefly, male
wistar rats (300-350 g) were killed by cervical dislocation and exsanguination. rat duodenum segments of
about 1.5 cm length were suspended under 1.5 g of
tension in 6-ml organ baths containing a modified
tyrode buffer (see organ bath solutions). relaxations
were induced by the ml-selective muscarinic receptor
agonist 4-(4-fluorophenylcarbamoyloxy)-2-butynyl-nmethylpyrrolidinium tosylate (4-f-pymcn +; lambrecht
et al., 1993) added at increasing concentrations with a
15-min interval between each. responses were
recorded isotonically using a force-displacement trans-

rabbit vas deferens
experiments on rabbit field-stimulated vas deferens
were carried out according to eltze (1988, 1994) and
eltze et al. (1988, 1993). briefly, vasa deferentia from
male new z e a l a n d white rabbits (2.5-3.0 kg; killed by
i.v. injection of pentobarbital sodium (120 m g / k g ) )
were removed, dissected free of connective tissues and
divided into 5 - 6 segments of about 1.0-1.5 cm length.
e a c h tissue was set up in a 6-ml organ bath containing
a modified krebs buffer (see o r g a n bath solutions).
t h e resting tension was adjusted to 500 mg and twitch
contractions were elicited by electrical field stimulation
(0.05 hz, 40 v, 0.5 ms) via platinum electrodes. t h e
neurogenic responses were m e a s u r e d isometrically with
a force-displacement transducer and r e c o r d e d on a
rikadenki multichannel recorder. antagonist affinities
for prejunctional muscarinic m 1 and postjunctional
muscarinic m 2 receptors were obtained from cumulative concentration-response curves either to the m 1selective muscarinic receptor agonist 4-(4-chloropheny l c a r b a m o y l o x y ) - 2 - b u t y n y l t r i m e t h y l a m m o n i u m iodide

guinea-pig left atria, ileum and trachea
guinea-pigs (300-400 g) of either sex were killed by
cervical dislocation and exsanguination. t h e organs
required were r e m o v e d and set up in 6-ml organ baths,
u n d e r 250 (left atria divided in two) and 500 mg
tension (ileum and trachea), in t y r o d e solution (see
o r g a n bath solutions).
left atria were electrically p a c e d (2 hz, 3 ms, 5 v)
by means of platinum electrodes, and negative inotropic effects to cumulative addition of the selective
muscarinic receptor agonist arecaidine propargyl ester
(mutschler and hultzsch, 1973; eltze et al., 1993) were
m e a s u r e d as changes in isometric tension and r e c o r d e d
as with the rabbit isolated vas deferens.
strips of ileal longitudinal muscle (paton and zar,
1968) were p r e p a r e d for isotonic contractions in response to cumulative administration of arecaidine
propargyl ester or histamine. responses to the agonists
were r e c o r d e d as with the rat d u o d e n u m .
isolated tracheal segments (1.5 cm) were cut longitudinally, and pinned out u n d e r t y r o d e solution.

centration-response curves were constructed to arecaidine propargyl ester. isotonic responses were recorded
as with the rat duodenum.

organ bath solutions
except for the rat duodenum (37Â°c), the bathing
fluid was maintained at 31Â°c and aerated with 95%
02-5% co 2 (ph = 7.4).
the tyrode solution used in the experiments on
guinea-pig atria, ileum and trachea as well as on the
rat duodenum was of the following composition (mm):
 xxxg2020xxx  137.0, kc1 2.7, cac12 1.8 (rat duodenum = 1.0),
mgc12 1.05, n a h 2 p o 4 0.42, nahco 3 11.9 and ( + ) glucose 5.6.
the modified krebs buffer used in the experiments
at the rabbit vas deferens consisted of (mm):  xxxg2020xxx 
118.0, kci 4.7, caci 2 1.0 (2.5 in experiments at muscarinic m 2 receptors), mgso 4 0.6, k h 2 p o 4 1.2,
nahco 3 25.0 and (+)-glucose 11.1. yohimbine (1.0
ixm) was included to block a2-adrenoceptors (eltze,
1988).

antagonist affinities
the tissues were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min.
then, concentration-response curves to the agonists
were constructed in the absence (control) and in the
presence of at least three concentrations (log interval
= 0.48) of antagonists, allowing 30-60 rain equilibration time. preliminary experiments indicated that these
intervals were sufficient for equilibration of the antagonist concentration used. the rat duodenum was exposed to only one concentration of antagonists. each
concentration of antagonist was tested 3-5 times and
the ratios of agonist molar ec50 values obtained in the
presence and absence of antagonists were calculated.
the ecs0 values were determined by fitting the data to
a non-linear iterative curve fitting procedure (parker
and waud, 1971; tallarida and murray, 1986). curves
in fig. 2 are fitted curves. for the assessment of
antagonist affinity, schild plots were made (arunlakshana and schild, 1959) using linear regression by
the method of least squares, pa 2 values were determined from schild plots in which the slopes of the

regression lines had been constrained to 1.00. this is
more consistent with the competitive theory which
connects p a 2 with - l o g ka, since the slopes obtained
in the present study (table 2) did not differ significantly from unity (tallarida and murray, 1986).

2.2. radioligand binding experiments
general considerations
protein concentrations were determined according
to lowry et al. (1951), using bovine  xxxg124xxx 
(fraction v; sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo, usa)
as standard. male wistar albino rats were killed by
decapitation and the brain, heart or pancreas immediately removed. h u m a n neuroblastoma nb-ok 1 cells
were cultured as previously described (waelbroeck et
al., 1988,1990a,b,1992,1994) in r p m i 1640 medium
enriched with 10% foetal calf serum, 100 u n i t s / m l
penicillin and 100 /xg/ral streptomycin. all the homogenates were prepared at 4Â°c.
the binding studies were performed at 25Â°c, at
equilibrium, in a 50 mm '.sodium phosphate buffer (ph
7.4) enriched with 2 mm mgc12 and 1% bovine serum
albumin, [3h]n-methylscopolamine and the indicated
unlabelled drug concentrations, in a total volume of 1.2
ml. bovine  xxxg124xxx  was an essential ingredient
in pancreas binding studies, since the binding capacity
of pancreas homogenates disappeared within 40 min at
room temperature if this protein was omitted from the
buffer, but was maintained over 90% for at least 4 h in
its presence. control experiments in nb-ok 1 cells as
well as in rat heart and striatum showed that the
competition curves with (r)- and (s)- xxxd1894xxx 
were not significantly ( p > 0.05) shifted to the right by
inclusion of 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  into the incuba-

233

tion buffer (data not shown). this allowed us to perform the binding experiments in all tissues in the
presence of bovine  xxxg124xxx .
the incubations were terminated by addition of 2 ml
of ice-cold 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4)
and filtration over glass-fiber g f c filters (whatman,
maidstone, uk) soaked in 0.05% polyethyleneimine
(sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo, usa). the filters
were rinsed 3 times with the same buffer, and dried.
the bound radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. non-specific binding was estimated as
binding in the presence of 1 /zm atropine.

preparation of the homogenates or crude membranes
used for binding studies
for [3h]n-methylscopolamine binding to muscarinic
m~ receptors, the nb-ok 1 cells were rinsed, harvested and centrifuged in 20 mm sodium phosphate
buffer (ph 7.4) containing 150 mm  xxxg2020xxx  and 1 mm
e d t a , resuspended and homogenized in 20 mm
tris/hc1 buffer (ph 7.5) enriched with 5 mm mgc12
and stored in liquid nitrogen. the incubation period
was 2 h, in the presence of 0.25 nm [3h]n-methylscopolamine and about 2 0 0 / z g protein per assay. the
tracer concentration was equivalent to two tracers' k d
values to muscarinic m 1 sites.
the rat heart was rinsed in isotonic naci, then
homogenized in 2.5 ml of 20 mm tris/hc1 buffer (ph
7.5), enriched with 250 mm sucrose, with an ultraturrax homogenizer (maximal speed, for 5 s) followed by
addition of 12.5 ml of the same buffer, seven up and
down strokes with a glass-teflon homogenizer and
filtration on two layers of medical gauze. the 2-h
incubation period was sufficient to allow equilibrium
binding of [3h]n-methylscopolamine and unlabelled

competitors to muscarinic m 2 receptors. the [3h]nmethylscopolamine concentration used was 1.0 nm, i.e.
two tracers' k d values to muscarinic m 2 sites, and the
protein concentration was 400-500/~g per assay.
the rat pancreas was minced with scissors and homogenized with a glass-teflon homogenizer (seven up
and down strokes) in 8 ml of 300 mm sucrose enriched
with 0.2 mg/ml bacitracin and 500 kallikrein inhibitor
units (kiu)/ml of trasylol. the resulting homogenate
was immediately filtered over two layers of medical
gauze and diluted ll-fold with the incubation buffer to
achieve final concentrations of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4), 2 mm mgc12 and 1% bovine
 xxxg124xxx . a 4-h incubation period was necessary
to allow full equilibration of [3h]n-methylscopolamine
binding at 25Â°c. the tracer concentration used was
0.25 nm, equivalent to two tracers' k o values to the
muscarinic m 3 sites in pancreas, and the pancreas
protein concentration was 0.8-1.0 mg per assay.
the rat striatum was homogenized in 2 ml of 20 mm
tris/hc1 buffer (ph 7.5), enriched with 250 mm sucrose, and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. the
homogenate was diluted 20-fold with the homogenization buffer, immediately before the incubation with
[3h]n-methylscopolamine. in rat striatum homogenates, [3h]n-methylscopolamine labels muscarinic m1,
very few m 2 and m3, and a majority of m 4 sites. it
dissociates faster from the muscarinic m 1 and m 2 sites
(waelbroeck et al., 1990a,b, 1992, 1994). the homogenate (equivalent to about 30 /zg protein) was
preincubated in a total volume of 1.2 ml, in the presence of [3h]n-methylscopolamine and unlabelled
drugs. a 2-h preincubation period allowed equilibrium
binding. then, 1 /xm atropine was added and tracer
dissociation was allowed for 35 min before filtration.
this procedure allowed us to investigate tracer binding
to the striatum muscarinic m 4 sites. the tracer concentration used in these experiments (0.25 nm) was equivalent to six tracers' k o values to striatum muscarinic
m 4 sites.

analysis of binding data
all competition curves were repeated 3 times in
duplicate. ics0 values were determined by a non-linear

curve fitting program, assuming that a single receptor
subtype was labelled by [3h]n-methylscopolamine
(waelbroeck et al., 1988, 1990a,b, 1992, 1994). k i values were calculated from ic50 values by the cheng and
prusoff (1973) equation. the pk i values shown in
table 3 correspond to - l o g k~ values.

2.3. statistics
all data are presented as means (+ s.e.m.) of the
indicated number (n) of experiments. differences between mean values were tested for statistical significance by means of student's t-test, accepting p < 0.05
as being significant.

[3h]n-methylscopolamine chloride (80-85 c i /
mmol) was obtained from amersham international

3.1. functional studies
racemic  xxxd1894xxx  and its enantiomers (0.3
n m - 3 0 /zm) did not elicit an agonist response itself
but surmountably antagonized responses to the agonists in all preparations studied. there was a concentration-dependent parallel shift to the right of agonist
dose-response curves without either the basal tension
or the maximal responses being affected. the schild
plots were linear throughout the antagonist concentration-range studied, and slopes were not significantly
different from unity ( p > 0.05; shown for (s)- xxxd1894xxx  in vas defere,ns, atria and ileum in fig. 2).
thus, (r,s)-, (r)- as well as (s)- xxxd1894xxx  were
apparently simple competitive antagonists in the
preparations studied. the affinities (pa 2 values) are
shown in table 2, and they were used to calculate
stereoselectivity and receptor selectivity ratios (table
4).

antimuscarinic effects of racemic  xxxd1894xxx  and its

electrical field stimulation of the rabbit vas deferens
elicited neurogenic twitch contractions which could be
concentration dependently inhibited by the ml-selective muscarinic receptor agonist 4-c1-mcn-a-343 (fig.
2a; - log ecs0 = 6.84 + 0.04, n = 30). similarly, exposure of the rat duodenum to the preferential muscarinic m 1 receptor agonist 4-f-pymcn + elicited a
concentration-dependent relaxation ( - l o g ecs0 = 6.11
+ 0.04, n = 53). both effects were antagonized with
very similar potency by pre-equilibration of the tissues
with (r)- and (s)- xxxd1894xxx , the pa 2 values being
5.81/5.49 and 6.83/6.36 in vas deferens and duodenum, respectively (tab]le 2).
(r)- and (s)- xxxd1894xxx  antagonized the negative
inotropic responses to arecaidine propargyl ester in
guinea-pig atria (fig. 2b; - l o g ec50 = 8.05 + 0.02, n

values obtained were 9.42 ((r)-isomer) and 7.48 ((s)isomer), respectively, the (r)-enantiomer being the
eutomer. these results confirm previous investigations
(borchard et al., 1985; nicholson et al., 1991; casy et
al., 1992; ter laak et al., 1993).

3.2. radioligand binding studies
in all tissues tested (table 1), (r)- and (s)- xxxd1894xxx  inhibited [3h]n-methylscopolamine binding to muscarinic receptors. the competition curves
(fig. 3) did not deviate significantly from results expected for competitive inhibition of tracer binding to a
single receptor subtype. hill coefficients (table 3) were
not significantly different from unity. the p k i values
are summarized in table 3.
(s)- xxxd1894xxx  was found to prefer clearly muscarinic m 2 (pk i = 7.78) over m 1 (pk i = 7.08), m 3 (pk i
= 6.70) and m 4 (pk i = 7.00) receptors, and it was
considerably more potent than the (r)-stereoisomer
(table 4). an excellent correlation was found between
the functional pa 2 values obtained in, respectively,
rabbit vas deferens, guinea-pig atria or ileum and the
p k i values obtained in nb-ok 1 cells (muscarinic m 1
receptors), rat heart (m 2 receptors) and rat pancreas
(m 3 receptors) (see discussion; fig. 4b).

and rabbit vas deferens (rvd); 13, ii) and m 3 receptors (guinea-pig

in binding studies in nb-ok 1 cells (m 1 receptors), rat heart (rh;

represent the lines of unity. the solid lines (a: slope = 0.93+_0.12,
r = 0.97; b: slope = 1.01+0.10, r = 0.98) represent the normal regression lines, the slopes of which were not significantly different
from unity ( p > 0.05).

it was the aim of the present study to explore the
affinity of the enantiomers of  xxxd1894xxx  at three
muscarinic receptor subtypes in functional studies on
isolated organs and in binding studies with tissue homogenates containing four different muscarinic receptor subtypes. in addition, histamine h 1 affinities were
determined in guinea-pig ileum.
in functional experiments, (r)- and (s)- xxxd1894xxx  behaved as competitive antagonists at muscarinic
m 1 (rabbit vas deferens, rat duodenum), m 2 (guinea-pig
atria, rabbit vas deferens), m 3 (guinea-pig ileum and
trachea) and histamine h 1 receptors (guinea-pig ileum).
they produced an antagonism that was reversible and
surmountable, and their apparent affinity in each tissue appeared to be independent of the concentrations
used. schild plots were linear and slopes not significantly different from unity. this functional competitive
antagonism by (r)- and (s)- xxxd1894xxx  could be
confirmed by the results of radioligand binding experiments at muscarinic m 1 (nb-ok 1 cells), m 2 (rat
heart), m 3 (rat pancreas) and m 4 receptors (rat striaturn).

4.2. correlations
in fig. 4 a, the antimuscarinic potencies (pa 2 values; table 2) of (r)- and (s)- xxxd1894xxx  at muscarinic m 1 (mediating inlhibition of neurogenic twitch
contractions in rabbit wts deferens), m 2 (mediating
negative inotropy in guinea-pig atria) and m 3 receptors
(mediating contraction in guinea-pig ileum) were plotted against their functional potencies obtained in rat
duodenum (m1), rabbit was deferens (m 2) and guineapig trachea (m3). an excellent correlation (r = 0.97)
was found between these affinity estimates.
in a complementary way functional antimuscarinic
potencies of (r)- and (s)- xxxd1894xxx  at muscarinic
m1, m 2 and m 3 receptors (table 2) were highly correlated (r = 0.98; fig. 4b) with their binding affinities
(table 3) in nb-ok 1 cells (m 1) as well as in rat heart
(m 2) and pancreas (m3), respectively.

4.3. stereoselectivity
in general, (s)- xxxd1894xxx  was more potent than
the (r)-enantiomer in all muscarinic assays. however,
the stereoselectivity ratios were found to be different
at the four muscarinic receptor subtypes, being greatest at muscarinic m 2 receptors (30- to 41-fold; table
4). these results provide additional evidence that
stereoselectivity ratios of chiral muscarinic antagonists
may be used as a parameter (besides absolute affinity
data) to characterize muscarinic receptor subtypes
(feifel et al., 1990; d6rje et al., 1991; waelbroeck et
al., 1990a, 1992; eltze et al., 1993).
the apparent affinity estimates of (r)- and (s)- xxxd1894xxx  at functiona!l histamine h i receptors in
guinea-pig ileum ( p a z / ( r ) = 9.42; p a 2 / ( s ) = 7.48)
are very similar to that reported by borchard et al.
(1985) and nicholson et al. (1991). in contrast with
muscarinic receptors (table 4) the (r)-enantiomer
proved to be the eutomer at histamine h l receptors
being 87-fold more potent than the (s)-configurated
stereoisomer. accordingly, these results demonstrate
an inverse stereoselectivity and imply that the stereochemical requirements of the muscarinic receptors and
histamine h 1 receptors, respectively, are different for
the enantiomers of  xxxd1894xxx , being most stringent
at histamine h~ receptors. such an inverse stereoselectivity for recognition of histamine h 1 and muscarinic
receptors has also been reported for chiral diphenhydramine analogues (rekker et al., 1971) as well as for
the enantiomers of cis-2,3-dihydro-3-(4-methyl-1piperazinylmethyl)-2-phenyl-l,5-benzothiazepin-4(5h)one (btm-1041 and btm-1086; eltze et al., 1989).

therapeutic implications
the commercially availlable  xxxd1894xxx  maleate,
used therapeutically as an histamine h 1 receptor antagonist, is a racemic mixture of the (r)- and (s)-enan-

237

tiomers. although the eutomer, (r)- xxxd1894xxx , is
about 1500-fold more potent on histamine h a receptors than on muscarinic m 2 receptors, the affinity of
(s)- xxxd1894xxx  for muscarinic m z receptors should
also be taken into consideration. the h 1 ( p a z / ( r ) =
9.42) over m2 ( p a 2 / ( s ) = 7.86) 'selectivity of the racemate' is still about 36-fold, so that side effects, such as
tachycardia, caused by blockade of cardiac muscarinic
m2 receptors remain unlikely. nevertheless, our results clearly illustrate the advantage of using pure
enantiomers as medicines.

4.4. muscarinic receptor subtype selectivity and receptor
specificity
in both functional and binding assays (s)- xxxd1894xxx  exhibited a higher affinity for the muscarinic m 2 receptors than for histamine h i receptors
and for the other muscarinic receptor subtypes. it
possesses the following selectivity profile: m 2 _> h 1 >
m1, m3, m 4. as far as muscarinic receptors are concerned, (s)- xxxd1894xxx  is 5- to 30-, 9- to 12- and
6-fold selective for muscarinic m 2 versus m 1, m 3 and
m 4 receptors (tables 2-4). the affinity profile of
(r)- xxxd1894xxx  (h 1 >> m e > m 4 _> mx, m 3) is different from that obtained for the (s)-isomer.
nicholson et al. (1991) determined the binding
affinities of (r)-and (s)- xxxd1894xxx  for several receptors in bovine frontal cortex and striatum. no specific binding was found (up to a concentration of 10
/zm) at a z- and fl-adrenoceptors as well as at benzodiazepine receptors, whereas both enantiomers showed
similar affinity to al-adrenoceptors ( k i = 0.33 and 0.55
/zm). (s)- xxxd1894xxx  ( k i --2.2 and 0.3 /zm) was
more potent than the (r)-enantiomer ( k i -- > 10 and
2.7/zm) at 5-ht 2 and dopamine d 2 receptors, but less
active at 5-ht 1 receptors ( k i / ( r ) = 2.8 )zm; k i / ( s )
--- > 10/zm).
as far as receptor specificity is concerned, these
data show that (s)- xxxd1894xxx  is a potent m2-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist possessing no or
very low affinity for a2- and/3-adrenoceptors, benzodiazepine receptors as well as for 5-ht 1 and 5-ht z
receptors.

4.5. comparison of (s)- xxxd1894xxx  with other 'm 2selective' antagonists
in contrast to (s)- xxxd1894xxx , other so-called
'm2-selective' muscarinic receptor antagonists such as
methoctramine, himbacine, 5,11-dihydro-ll-[[(2-[2-[(dipropylamino)methyl]- 1-piperidinyl]ethyl)amino]carbonyl]-6h- xxxd3047xxx [2,3-b][1,4] benzodiazepin-6-one (afdx 384), ll-[[4-[4-(diethylamino)butyl]-l-piperidinyl]
acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6h- xxxd3047xxx [2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepin-6-one (aq-ra 741) or imperialine are not able to
distinguish clearly between muscarinic m 2 and m 4 r e -

ceptors (see hulme et al., 1990; waelbroeck et al.,
1990b; d6rje et al., 1991;  xxxd1704xxx  et al., 1992; caulfield,
1993; maggio et al., 1994 for references). on the other
hand, (s)- xxxd1894xxx  resembles the two  xxxd2965xxx  analogues, af-dx 116 and 5,11-dihydro-8-chloro-ll-[[4-[3-[(2,2-dimethyl-l-oxopentyl)ethylamino]propyl]-l-piperidinyl]acetyl]-6h- xxxd3047xxx [2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepin-6-one (bibn 99; doods et al., 1993), in terms of
its pharmacological and binding profile at muscarinic
receptor subtypes in that it acts as an m2-selective
muscarinic receptor antagonist with respect to m 1, m 3
and m 4 sites. however, the affinity of (s)- xxxd1894xxx  for muscarinic m 2 receptors is higher than that
found for af-dx 116 and bibn 99. binding studies
with a9 l and cho cells, respectively, expressing the
cloned muscarinic receptor subtypes m l - m 4 showed
that the alkaloid derivative 3-a-chlorimperialine
(baumgold et al., 1994) and the  xxxd2965xxx  analogue
diba bound with subnanomolar affinity to m2 receptors, but with lower affinity to the other three subtypes
(6-fold m2 over m4). these results obtained from radioligand binding experiments must remain provisional
until confirmed in functional experiments. the
methoctramine analogue tripitramine has been reported to have high affinity for native muscarinic m 2
receptors in rat heart (pk i = 9.54) and to display extremely high subtype selectivity (m 2 > m 1 = 81-fold;
m 2 > m 3 = 2239; m 2 > m 4 = 41; melchiorre et al.,
1993). however, this high muscarinic m 2 receptor selectivity of tripitramine has recently been questioned
on the basis of results obtained in functional experiments (lambrecht et al., 1995) and in binding studies
at cloned muscarinic receptor subtypes m l - m 4 (maggio et al., 1994). the muscarinic receptor selectivities
m z / m 2 > m a / m l (3.5- to 23-fold) as well as m z / m 2
> m3/m3 (32- to 251-fold) found in these studies were
much lower than that reported by melchiorre et al.
(1993). the reason for this discrepancy is unknown.
further experiments are needed to clarify this issue.
therapeutic implications

as already mentioned in the introduction, m2-selective muscarinic receptor antagonists could be useful as
diagnostic tools for quantifying the loss of muscarinic
m 2 receptors in the brain of patients with alzheimer's
disease with positron emission tomography imaging
(dewey et al., 1990; gitler et al., 1992; cohen et al.,
1993). in addition, such compounds might be a further
option for the treatment of dementia of the alzheimer's
type (doods et al., 1993). although several muscarinic
receptor antagonists with high affinity for m 2 receptors have been described (see above), most of these
compounds suffer from clear limitations.
antimuscarinic agents such as af-dx 116, aq-ra
741, af-dx 384, himbacine, diba and methoctramine (probably also tripitramine) are not able to

penetrate readily into the brain (cohen et al., 1993;
doods et al., 1991, 1993). baumgold et al. (1994) reported that 3-a-chlorimperialine is able to cross the
blood-brain barrier. however, its muscarinic m 2 receptor selectivity has not been well established. in addition, 3-a-chlorimperialine has, like the parent alkaloid
imperialine, a very complicated chemical structure, and
both compounds are highly expensive. recently, the
 xxxd2965xxx  analogue bibn 99 has been reported to be
a lipophilic m2-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist and to exhibit central nervous system activity.
positive results were obtained in animal models of
cognitive function (doods et al., 1993). therefore,
bibn 99 may be considered as a tool to investigate the
role of muscarinic m 2 receptors in the brain.
it is noteworthy that  xxxd1894xxx  is a lipophilic
compound, both enantiomers of which were able to
penetrate readily into the brain of human healthy
volunteers (nicholson et al., 1991; casy et al., 1992;
cicurel et al., 1992). in addition, radler and blaschke
(1991) showed that the equal ease of (r)- and (s)- xxxd1894xxx  to cross the blood-brain barrier was not
influenced by differences in metabolism of the two
enantiomers.
in conclusion, the experiments described in the present study demonstrate that (s)- xxxd1894xxx  is a novel
m2-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist and a useful tool to investigate muscarinic receptor heterogeneity. in addition, it might become the starting point for
the development of m2-selective muscarinic receptor
antagonists useful as diagnostic tools for quantifying
muscarinic m 2 receptors in the central nervous system
with positron emission tomography imaging, and to test
the hypothesis that muscarinic m 2 receptor antagonists
show beneficial effects in the treatment of cognitive
disorders. the m 2 vs. m 1 muscarinic receptor selectivity is of special importance in terms of the potential
therapeutic use of muscarinic antagonists to reverse
the cholinergic hypofunction in patients with
alzheimer's disease. such an m z vs. m 1 muscarinic
receptor selectivity may guarantee that the compound
does not counteract its acetylcholine releasing action
by blockade of postsynaptic muscarinic m~ receptors.
one interesting aspect of using labelled (s)- xxxd1894xxx  as a positron emission tomography ligand for
quantifying muscarinic m 2 receptors in the central
nervous system is the availability of the (r)-isomer,
which can be used in its unlabelled form to exclude
binding of labelled (s)- xxxd1894xxx  to histamine h~
receptors under the imaging condition.
