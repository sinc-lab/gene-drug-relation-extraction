abstract
on march 16, 2007, eculizumab (soliris威; alexion
pharmaceuticals, inc. cheshire, ct), a humanized
monoclonal antibody that binds to the human c5 complement protein, received accelerated approval by the
u.s. food and drug administration for the treatment of
patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
(pnh) to reduce hemolysis. eculizumab was studied in
a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
trial in 87 rbc transfusion– dependent adult pnh patients and in a supportive single-arm study in 96 patients. the eculizumab dose was 600 mg as a 35-minute
i.v. infusion administered weekly for the first 4 weeks
followed by 900 mg (week 5) then 900 mg every 14 days
thereafter. hemoglobin stabilized in 21 of 43 (48.8%)
eculizumab-treated patients, compared with none of 44

placebo-treated patients. eculizumab-treated patients
required significantly fewer rbc transfusions than placebo-treated patients (median, 0 versus 10 units). there
was also a significant reduction in the serum lactate dehydrogenase area under the curve with eculizumab
compared with placebo treatment. results of the phase
ii supportive study were similar to those of the phase iii
study. the safety database included 196 adult patients
with pnh. significant findings included the development of human anti-human antibody responses in three
patients and serious meningococcal infections in three
patients. patients should undergo meningococcal vaccination at least 2 weeks prior to receiving the first
eculizumab treatment and have revaccination according to current medical guidelines. patients must

introduction

for iron deficiency, and bone marrow transplantation. for
patients who developed venous thromboembolism, treatment included anticoagulation with low molecular weight
heparin followed by chronic warfarin therapy [8].
eculizumab (soliris威; alexion pharmaceuticals, inc.
cheshire, ct) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that
binds to the human c5 complement protein with high affinity, thereby inhibiting its cleavage to c5a and  xxxg285xxx  and preventing the generation of the terminal complement complex
 xxxg285xxx -9 (membrane attack complex), responsible for the lysis of pnh rbcs lacking cell surface terminal complement
inhibitor cd59 [9].
biochemically, eculizumab is an igg␬ immunoglobulin
comprised of human constant regions and murine complementarity determining regions grafted onto human framework light and heavy chain variable regions. eculizumab is
composed of two 448 –amino acid heavy chains and two
214 –amino acid light chains and has a molecular weight of
approximately 148 kda. eculizumab does not inhibit c5
activity in animal sera but does bind to human tissues, including smooth and striated muscle as well as renal proximal epithelium. in animal studies, eculizumab was found to
cross the placental barrier and show fetal morbidity and
mortality [9].
the metabolism of eculizumab is understood to be via
lysosomal enzymes to small peptides and amino acids, as is
described for other proteins. in humans, the volume of distribution of eculizumab approximates that of plasma.
pharmacodynamic assays demonstrate that inhibition of
c5 sufficient to prevent hemolysis occurs at eculizumab
plasma concentrations in excess of 35 ␮g/ml. maximum
plasma concentrations of eculizumab with therapeutic
doses of the drug are achieved within 1 hour of infusion.

paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (pnh) is an uncommon, life-threatening hemolytic anemia. the disease is
characterized by acute exacerbations of chronic intravascular hemolysis, venous thrombosis with predilection for intra-abdominal and cerebral veins, and bone marrow failure
[1, 2]. other common symptoms, likely related to hemoglobin-mediated  xxxd2738xxx  scavenging, include smooth muscle dystonias of the gastrointestinal tract, manifested as
dysphagia, esophageal spasm, and abdominal pain; vascular constriction, possibly causing erectile dysfunction and
pulmonary hypertension; endothelial dysfunction, causing
hypertension and increased vascular permeability and renal
dysfunction with acute or chronic renal failure; and fanconi
syndrome (glycosuria, hyperaminoaciduria, hyperphosphaturia, and bicarbonate and water loss) [3, 4].
the cellular abnormality of pnh is caused by an acquired somatic mutation in the x chromosome of a totipotent hematopoietic stem cell [5]. this mutation leads to a
deficiency in phosphatidylinositol glycan class a protein
critical for the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol
membrane anchoring proteins (gpi-aps). as a result, there
is a partial (type ii) or complete (type iii) deficiency of gpiaps on the surface of pnh stem cells. two such deficient
proteins are the complement inhibitors  xxxg394xxx  and cd59.
failure of complement regulation by these proteins renders
pnh erythrocytes susceptible to complement-mediated
lysis.
diagnosis of pnh can be established by flow cytometric determination of the proportion of gpi-ap– deficient
erythrocytes or granulocytes as determined using appropriate monoclonal antibodies and the flaer assay (gpi-aps
are receptors for proaerolycin, a bacterial toxin that can be
fluoresceinated). the latter test enhances sensitivity and
specificity for the diagnosis of pnh [6].
small to moderate numbers of pnh clones are found in
up to 70% of patients with acquired aplastic anemia, and
gpi-ap– deficient cells have also been reported in patients
with myelodysplastic syndrome (mds). occasionally gpiap– deficient cells are found in normal subjects but these
are polyclonal and only manifest in committed cells with no
self-renewal capability [7].
prior to the approval of eculizumab, there was no approved therapy for pnh. therapies commonly used included blood transfusion, erythrocyte-stimulating agent
therapy, corticosteroids, anabolic steroids, oral iron therapy

patients and methods
submitted clinical data include a randomized double-blind,
placebo-controlled, multicenter study of eculizumab or placebo administered i.v. to patients with pnh (the triumph
study [a hemoglobin stabilization in transfusion reduction efficacy and safety clinical investigation, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
using eculizumab and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria patients]) and a supporting open-label, phase iii
study (the shepherd study [safety in hemolytic paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria patients treated with

screening (low stratum, 4 –14 units; middle stratum, 15–25
units; high stratum, ⬎25 units). patients randomized to the
placebo group received placebo i.v. once a week for five
doses then once every 2 weeks for 21 weeks. patients randomized to the eculizumab group received eculizumab at a
dose of 600 mg via a 35-minute i.v. infusion weekly for the
first 4 weeks then 900 mg (week 5) then 900 mg every 14
days thereafter for 26 weeks total treatment. following the
26 weeks of treatment, there was an 8- to 12-week posttreatment follow-up period. the study drug and placebo for
the treatment period were supplied by alexion pharmaceuticals, inc., cheshire, ct.
patients enrolled in the shepherd study received the
same eculizumab dosing regimen as used in the triumph
study. this study had a 12-week enrollment phase followed
by a 2-week screening phase followed by a 52-week treatment phase and an 8-week post-treatment phase. the inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar to those of the
triumph study with the exception that patients in the
shepherd study were required to have one or more transfusions in 24 months, compared with four or more transfusions in 12 months in the triumph study, and a platelet
count ⱖ30,000/␮l, compared with a platelet count
ⱖ100,000/␮l.
for the primary analysis, the hemoglobin set point for
each patient was defined as ⱕ9 g/dl in patients with symptoms and ⱕ7 g/dl in patients without symptoms. to achieve
a designation of hemoglobin stabilization, a patient had to
maintain a hemoglobin concentration above the hemoglobin set point and avoid any rbc transfusion for the entire
26-week treatment period. patients who reached or dropped
below their predetermined hemoglobin set point did not
achieve hemoglobin stabilization. those patients who withdrew prematurely from the study or were transfused above
their hemoglobin set point during the treatment phase also
were treated as not achieving hemoglobin stabilization. a
two-sided fisher’s exact test was used for statistical analysis. each patient’s units of packed rbcs transfused after
randomization through visit 18 were calculated. for those
patients who discontinued the study drug but remained in
the study for follow-up, the actual transfusion records were
used to calculate the units transfused. for patients who had
at least one transfusion but withdrew prematurely from the
study prior to 26 weeks, the number of units was prorated
by applying the formula (26/number of weeks on study
drug) ⫻ (number of units transfused while on study drug).
for patients who withdrew prematurely from the study
prior to having a transfusion, their transfusion data for the
26 weeks previous to their last contact date was used to calculate the number of units of packed rbcs transfused. the
primary analysis method was the wilcoxon rank-sum test.

eculizumab: the multicenter, open label, research design study]) [10 –12].
the primary objective of the triumph trial was to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of eculizumab in transfusion-dependent patients with pnh. the trial consisted of a
2-week screening period, an observation period up to 3
months, and a 26-week treatment period. the coprimary efficacy endpoints were hemoglobin stabilization and the
number of packed rbc units transfused during the treatment phase of the study. the secondary objectives of this
study were transfusion avoidance and hemolysis as measured by lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) area under the curve
(auc) from baseline through week 26. this study also had
exploratory endpoints of ldh change from baseline
through week 26, health-related quality of life (qol), as
measured by the european organization for research and
treatment of cancer quality of life questionnaire
(eortc qlq)-c30 from baseline through week 26, as
well as measures of thrombosis, platelet activity,  xxxd2738xxx , and free hemoglobin.
the primary objective of the shepherd study was to
evaluate the safety of eculizumab in patients with transfusion-dependent pnh. the secondary objectives of that
study were to analyze hemolysis reduction as measured by
ldh auc and changes in the functional assessment of
chronic illness therapy–fatigue (facit-f) qol scale.
exploratory endpoints included health-related qol as measured by the eortc qlq-c30 and measures of thrombosis, platelet activity,  xxxd2738xxx , and free hemoglobin.
the major inclusion criteria for the triumph trial
were age ⱖ18 years, rbc transfusion requirement, cd59
cell clone ⱖ10%, stable doses of erythrocyte-stimulating
agents, immunosuppressives, iron,  xxxd2146xxx , corticosteroids, and anticoagulants, and vaccination against neisseria
meningitides at least 14 days prior to treatment. in addition,
patients were required to have an ldh level ⱖ1.5 times the
upper limit of normal. patients had to have had rbc transfusions if their hemoglobin was ⱕ9 g/dl with symptoms or
if their hemoglobin was ⱕ7 g/dl without symptoms, and
also within 1.5 g/dl of the mean hemoglobin pretransfusion
value for the previous 12 months. a platelet count
ⱖ100,000/␮l and an absolute neutrophil count ⱖ500/␮l
were also required. excluded patients included those with a
history of bone marrow transplantation or meningococcal
disease presence or suspicion of other bacterial infection,
known or suspected hereditary complement deficiency, and
pregnant or breast-feeding women or women intending to
conceive during the course of the study, including the posttreatment phase.
treatment assignment was stratified based on the number of packed rbc transfusions within 1 year prior to

calculate the fatigue score. the main hypothesis of interest
was that eculizumab would provide a statistically significant higher patients’ total facit-f scale score than placebo. the change in the total facit-f score from baseline
was analyzed using a mixed-effects model with baseline as
covariate, treatment and time as fixed effects, and patient as
a random effect.

results
in the triumph study, 114 patients were screened, 108
entered the observation phase, and 88 protocol-eligible patients were randomized. one patient was removed from the
analysis because of being randomized in error; therefore, 87
patients entered the treatment phase. of the patients treated,
85 completed all visits. two patients randomized to eculizumab discontinued treatment prematurely, one because of
pregnancy and one because of not wanting to travel; 10 patients in the placebo group discontinued study drug prematurely because of a lack of efficacy but completed all study
visits for follow-up.
the analysis population (intent-to-treat [itt]) included
all 87 randomized and treated patients. demographics and
baseline characteristics of the itt population are shown in
table 1. there were no statistically significant differences

between treatment groups in the pretreatment characteristics of patients.
results of the primary efficacy analysis after 26 weeks
on study are summarized in table 2. significantly more patients in the eculizumab treatment group showed hemoglobin stabilization than in the placebo treatment group (48.8%
versus 0.0%; p ⬍ .0001), and patients in the eculizumab
treatment group required significantly fewer packed rbc
transfusions than patients in the placebo group (median, 0.0
units versus 10.0 units; p ⬍ .0001). for each of the three
treatment strata, eculizumab treatment significantly decreased rbc transfusion requirements, and for the first two
strata, eculizumab treatment significantly increased the
percentage of patients with hemoglobin stabilization.
results of secondary efficacy analyses for the overall
study populations are shown in table 3. outcomes were
statistically significantly better in the eculizumab treatment
group than in the placebo group for each of these secondary
endpoints. the favorable result for eculizumab with regard
to efficacy was apparent across all randomization strata.

placebo treatment group) during the study.
overall, 96 of the 97 enrolled patients completed the
open-label supportive study (one patient died following a
thrombotic event). a reduction in intravascular hemolysis
as measured by serum ldh levels was sustained for the entire treatment period and resulted in a reduced need for rbc
transfusions.
patients were tested for human antihuman antibodies
(hahas) after eculizumab treatment, and two patients
were found to have igg titers of 1:20 and one patient had
igm titers of 1:20 and 1:100. no patient developed a rebound in hemolysis with these antibodies. also, because of
concern of rebound hemolysis after discontinuing eculizumab, it was planned to follow patients after discontinuation of eculizumab, but few patients in the controlled study
discontinued eculizumab prematurely and most patients
continued into extension studies of eculizumab after completing study treatment.

discussion
eculizumab appears to be generally safe and effective for
the treatment of pnh patients with transfusion-dependent
hemolysis. the efficacy of eculizumab was demonstrated
by the stabilization of hemoglobin and a lower number of
packed rbc transfusions in these patients. eculizumab
also improves clinically measured hemolysis parameters
such as ldh. the small number of patients, the low thrombotic event rate, and the high rate of concomitant antithrombotic agent use in the controlled clinical study preclude
meaningful assessment of the effect of eculizumab on
thrombosis in pnh patients. measurement of qol as assessed by the facit-f scale showed improvement in the
eculizumab treatment group; however, the tool was administered to patients prior to transfusion without post-transfusion tool administration, so it is not possible to determine
whether any difference between groups in the facit-f
score is a result of the eculizumab or the anemia correction.
also, the facit-f scale has not been validated in pnh patients.
as part of the approval of eculizumab, the sponsor
agreed to a number of postmarketing commitments. the
sponsor will evaluate the long-term safety of eculizumab by
analyzing outcomes in the pnh registry program for a period ⱖ5 years. the sponsor will also evaluate serious infections necessitating or prolonging hospitalization or
resulting in death. the rate of malignancy, including the nature of the malignancy and the survival status of pnh patients who develop a malignancy, will be determined. for
women who become pregnant, the sponsor will evaluate the
clinical course and any congenital abnormalities among
offspring. a randomized clinical trial to assess the effects of
anticoagulant withdrawal among patients with pnh will
also be initiated. the sponsor will also evaluate haha formation.
patients with pnh who are treated with eculizumab are
at a higher risk for infections with neisseria meningitides
[13]. an early alert program and a registry program have
been instituted to minimize the risk for infections. patients
who are to be treated with eculizumab must be vaccinated
with neisseria meningitides vaccine at least 2 weeks prior
to treatment with eculizumab.
pregnant women with pnh and their fetuses have high
rates of morbidity and mortality during pregnancy and the
postpartum period. there are no adequate and well-controlled studies of eculizumab in pregnant women. it is likely
that eculizumab will cross the placenta and appear in breast
milk.
eculizumab has not been studied in patients ⱕ18 years
old. experience with eculizumab in the geriatric population
is limited; in pnh studies, only 15 patients aged ⱖ65 years

of a normal infant) and one because of patient choice. the
most frequent adverse events occurring during this study
are summarized in table 4. adverse events that were notably more common in eculizumab-treated patients than in
placebo-treated patients were headache, back pain, fatigue,
and respiratory tract infection. viral infection, urinary tract
infection, and pnh were more frequent in the placebo
group. no patients died.
among the 193 pnh patients who received eculizumab
in uncontrolled studies, serious adverse events occurring in
two or more patients were viral infection (2.6%), headache
(2.1%), anemia (1.6%), pyrexia (1.6%), and hemolysis
(1.0%). across all pnh studies overall, infections did not
seem to be more frequent in patients who received eculizumab than in those who received placebo. the incidence
of herpes simplex infection appeared to be greater in pnh
patients treated with eculizumab (8 of 140; 5.7%), versus
none in the pivotal trial placebo control.
because eculizumab inhibits complement activation, it
may impair neutrophil and monocyte function and impair
the ability of the patient to clear infections with encapsulated organisms. there were three cases of neisseria meningitis in patients receiving eculizumab, including a 22year-old unvaccinated woman with idiopathic membranous
glomerulonephritis who had received eculizumab for about
7 months, a 54-year-old vaccinated female pnh patient
who had been on eculizumab for approximately 14 months,
and a 24-year-old male vaccinated pnh patient who had received eculizumab for approximately 12 months. no patient died, but the unvaccinated patient had a complicated
course with amputation of parts of some digits because of
gangrene, pulmonary embolus, and pneumonia. as a result
of this experience, all study patients were required to be
vaccinated against neisseria meningitides at least 2 weeks
prior to starting study treatment.
a total of four eculizumab-treated pnh patients died.
these include a 31-year-old man with pnh and hemosiderosis who suffered a pulmonary embolus and a hemorrhagic
cerebral infarction 31 days after the last eculizumab dose; a
female patient with cholecystitis who became septic and
died from a cerebrovascular accident about 2 months after
her last eculizumab dose; a man with mds who developed
cellulitis, sepsis, and acute renal failure after a fish hook infection and died from worsening of his mds; and a woman
who died of metastatic adenocarcinoma after 13 months on
eculizumab.

number of patients aged ⱖ65 is not sufficient to determine
whether they respond differently from younger patients.
