abstract
▲  xxxd2645xxx  is an orally administered ceramide
glucosyltransferase inhibitor which prevents the
lysosomal accumulation of glucocerebroside that
occurs in patients with gaucher’s disease.
▲ in noncomparative trials in patients with type 1
gaucher’s disease,  xxxd2645xxx  (50 or 100mg three
times daily) for 6–12 months significantly reduced
baseline liver and spleen volumes. at both 6 and 12
months, the reductions in organ volumes were
greater with the higher dosage.
▲  xxxd2645xxx  50 or 100mg three times daily for 6–12
months had no significant effect on haemoglobin
concentrations. baseline platelet counts were not
significantly improved by either dosage at 6
months, although the higher dosage significantly
increased platelet counts at 12 months.
▲ in an open extension phase, patients continued to
show further reductions in organ volume as well as
significant improvements in haematological parameters at 24 and 36 months.
▲ in a 6-month randomised study in patients with type
1 gaucher’s disease who had previously received
long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ert), liver
volume reduction was greater with  xxxd2645xxx  plus
ert than with ert alone.

 xxxd2645xxx 

gaucher’s disease is a rare glycosphingolipid
lysosomal storage disorder resulting from a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase (also referred to as acid beta-glucosidase or
beta-glucosylceramidase). the enzyme deficiency
leads to the intracellular accumulation of the substrate, glucocerebroside (also known as glucosylceramide), the parent compound of many glycosphingolipids. glucocerebroside accumulates primarily in macrophages, as a result of phagocytosis
rather than by in situ production within these cells.
the disease results from autosomal recessive inheritance of mutations in the gene coding for
beta-glucocerebrosidase that is located in the q21 region of chromosome 1.[1-5]
gaucher’s disease is classified according to the
presence or absence and severity of neurological
involvement. type 1 is the most common subtype
and does not involve the central nervous system
(cns), unlike types 2 (acute, infantile form) and 3
(chronic, late-onset form) which are characteristically neuronopathic. the clinical manifestations within
each classification type are highly variable and correlate, although not absolutely, with the nature of the
mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene.[3,4] in type
1 gaucher’s disease, lipid-engorged macrophages
infiltrate the viscera, especially the liver and spleen,
and the bone marrow. the clinical manifestations
commonly include hepatosplenomegaly, anaemia,
thrombocytopenia, and bone lesions in patients with
severe disease.[1-5]
1

there are estimated to be about 20 000 patients
with gaucher’s disease worldwide (predominantly
type 1). the disease is panethnic, but is highly
prevalent in ashkenazi jews with a frequency of
approximately 1 in 850, compared with a prevalence
of about 1 in 40 000 in non-jewish populations.[1,2,5]
the current treatment of choice for type 1
gaucher’s disease is enzyme replacement therapy
(ert) with macrophage-targeted beta-glucocerebrosidase. originally, the enzyme (alglucerase)
was isolated from human placentae prior to modification to expose terminal mannose residues required
for targeting to macrophages, but recombinant
enzyme ( xxxd2336xxx ) has now replaced the
placenta-derived form. ert reduces organomegaly
and improves haematological and biochemical
indices. it also decreases bone pain, prevents new
bone crises, and improves bone mineralisation, at a
slower rate.[2,6] however, treatment is lifelong, requires repeated intravenous infusions and is extremely expensive.[5] prior to the advent of ert, the
only curative therapy was allogeneic bone marrow
transplantation. therapeutic interventions included
fracture treatment, joint replacement and splenectomy.[7-9]
 xxxd2645xxx  ( xxxd2645xxx ®1; previously named  xxxd2645xxx ) is an orally active agent that offers a new approach to the therapy of gaucher’s disease by inhibiting the formation of substrate for the deficient
enzyme (figure 1). all patients with type 1
gaucher’s disease have some level of residual
beta-glucocerebrosidase activity. the aim of substrate
reduction therapy is to lower the production of substrate to a level with which the residual enzyme
activity can cope.[10,11]  xxxd2645xxx  reversibly inhibits
the enzyme,  xxxg2376xxx , that catalyses the formation of glucocerebroside and thereby prevents its accumulation within macrophages.[10,11]
this review focuses on the use of  xxxd2645xxx  in
adult patients with type 1 gaucher’s disease.

disrupted in type 1 gaucher’s disease, showing the points of action of  xxxd2645xxx  and enzyme replacement therapy (ert). udp = uridine 5′diphosphate.

1. pharmacodynamic profile
 xxxd2645xxx  is a non-peptidic, water-soluble n-butyl derivative of the naturally occurring glucosidase
inhibitor  xxxd1955xxx . it inhibits ceramide
glucosyltransferase ( xxxg2376xxx ; nacylsphingosine glucosyltransferase) which catalyses the transfer of glucose to ceramide to form
glucocerebroside, the first step in glycosphingolipid
biosynthesis.[10,11]
● the inhibitory constant (ki) of  xxxd2645xxx  was 7.4
mumol/l using ceramide as the acceptor and human
hl-60 cells as the source of glucosyltransferase.[12]
in hl-60 cell microsomal preparations,  xxxd2645xxx 
inhibited  xxxg2376xxx  with an ic50
(concentration producing 50% inhibition of glucose
transfer) of 20.4 mumol/l.[13]
● in an in vitro model of gaucher’s disease,  xxxd2645xxx  50–500 mumol/l prevented the accumulation of
glucocerebroside in murine macrophages as determined by thin layer chromatography.[14] at the highest concentration tested (500 mumol/l), glucocerebroside was almost undetectable. the lack of
glycosphingolipid accumulation in lysosomes was
confirmed visually by electron microscopy.
● the use of  xxxd2645xxx  for substrate deprivation
was shown to be a valid approach to the treatment of
glycosphingolipid lysosomal storage diseases by its
beneficial effects in a symptomatic mouse model of
sandhoff disease, which results in peripheral and
cns accumulation of glycosphingolipids. in this
model, treatment with  xxxd2645xxx  4800 mg/kg from 3

weeks of age or 2400 mg/kg from 6 weeks of age
significantly reduced glycosphingolipid storage in
the brain and liver (by 35–86% for gangliosides
gm2 or  xxxd2178xxx  at 112 days; p < 0.05–0.001), slowed
the onset of symptoms (136 days in treated mice vs
104 days in untreated mice; p < 0.001) and extended
the life expectancy by approximately 40% (170 vs
125 days; p < 0.001).[15]
●  xxxd2645xxx  therapy (100mg three times daily) in
patients with type 1 gaucher’s disease (n = 5) [see
section 3] reduced gm1 ganglioside concentrations
in circulating leucocytes by 38.5% (p = 0.006 versus
baseline) over 12 months.[16]  xxxd2645xxx  did not appear to inhibit n-glycan processing alpha-glucosidases
in these patients, since there was no increase in the
plasma concentration of n-linked glycosylated oligosaccharide.
2. pharmacokinetic profile
there are limited data available on the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd2645xxx  at the dosages used in
the treatment of type 1 gaucher’s disease. the bulk
of the available information derives from a subset of
patients (n = 11) enrolled in two noncomparative
clinical trials[16,17] and the manufacturer’s summary
of product characteristics.[18] there are no pharmacokinetic data available in patients with hepatic impairment or in the elderly (>70 years).[18]
●  xxxd2645xxx  is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) of 2.5 hours.[16,17] a single 100mg dose
produced a maximum plasma concentration (cmax)
drugs 2003; 63 (22)

2430

of 0.86 mug/ml.[16] the rate of absorption is decreased when  xxxd2645xxx  is administered with food
(cmax decreased by 36% and tmax delayed by 2
hours), although the extent of absorption is not
significantly altered (area under the plasma concentration-time curve [auc] decreased by 14%).[18]
● according to the product information sheet,
 xxxd2645xxx  does not bind to plasma proteins and has
an apparent volume of distribution equal to 83l.[18]
the absolute bioavailability has not been determined.
● in clinical trials, steady-state plasma concentrations were attained within 4–6 weeks. the peak and
trough steady state concentrations for a  xxxd2645xxx 
50mg three times daily dosage regimen were 0.8 and
0.3–0.4 mug/ml, respectively,[17] while those for a
100mg three times daily dosage regimen were 1.5
and 0.8 mug/ml (values estimated from a graph).[16]
● the apparent elimination half-life (t1/2) of  xxxd2645xxx  is between 6–7 hours.[16,17] according to the
manufacturer’s product information, the major route
of excretion appears to be renal and data from a
limited number of patients with fabry’s disease
show that the oral clearance decreases with decreasing renal function.[18] the apparent oral clearance is
230 ± 39 ml/min and decreases by approximately
40%, 60% and >70% in patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively.
● limited data from a small parallel group study
suggest that concomitant administration of  xxxd2645xxx 
and ert ( xxxd2336xxx ) may decrease the exposure
to  xxxd2645xxx  (22% reduction in cmax and 14% reduction in auc),[18] but  xxxd2645xxx  has negligible effects
on the pharmacokinetics of ert.
● although data are limited, there are no indications of alterations in pharmacokinetic parameters
with age, gender or body mass.[18]
3. therapeutic trials
the results from three studies of  xxxd2645xxx  in
adults with mild-to-moderate type 1 gaucher’s disease are currently in the public domain (two noncomparative studies[16,17] and one randomised comparative study[19,20]). the two noncomparative studies have been published in full, while details for the

comparative study were obtained from a media release and the us prescribing information (package
insert).  xxxd2645xxx  has not been studied in patients
with severe gaucher’s disease (defined as a haemoglobin concentration < 9 g/dl, a platelet count < 50
× 109/l or active bone disease).[18]
in the noncomparative studies, patients who were
unable or unwilling to receive ert, and who had
not received ert in the previous 3 months, were
enrolled. the primary efficacy endpoints were reduction in volume of liver and spleen, and elevation
of haemoglobin levels and platelet counts. plasma
activity of the enzyme  xxxg444xxx , which is released from activated macrophages and is elevated
in gaucher’s disease, was also monitored as a biochemical marker of disease activity. the primary
endpoint in the comparative study, in which patients
on long-term ert therapy were enrolled, was reduction in liver volume, although spleen volume,
haemoglobin levels and platelet counts were also
monitored.
at the end of all studies, patients who benefited
from  xxxd2645xxx  therapy (defined by organ volume
reduction or improved symptoms) were eligible to
continue treatment with  xxxd2645xxx  in extended-use
phases.
noncomparative studies

in the first noncomparative trial, conducted by
cox et al.,[16] 28 adult patients from four centres
received  xxxd2645xxx  100mg three times daily for 12
months. twenty three patients were evaluated at 6
months, while 22 patients were evaluated at 12
months. the study population included seven patients who had undergone previous splenectomy and
six patients who had previously received ert.
 xxxd2645xxx  dosage adjustment was permitted
throughout the study, based on plasma drug levels
(target plasma concentrations ≤2 mug/ml), tolerability, and organ volume response after 6 months. the
maximum administered dosage was 200mg three
times daily in three patients. eighteen patients entered the extended-use protocol and continued to
receive  xxxd2645xxx  for up to 36 months (n = 13).

 xxxd2645xxx : adis drug profile

liver and spleen volumes

in both studies, there were significant mean reductions from baseline in liver and spleen volume at
6 and 12 months (figure 2). the percentage reduction in liver volume at 6 months was slightly greater
with the higher 100mg dosage regimen used in the
study by cox et al.[16] additional liver volume reduction was observed at 12 months with the 100mg
dose,[16] but not with the 50mg initial dose used in
the heitner et al. study.[17] spleen volume reductions
from baseline were 3-fold higher with the 100mg
dose[16] than with the 50mg dose[17] at 6 months.
with both dosage regimens, spleen volumes were
further reduced at 12 months.[16,17]
● in the extension phase of the study by cox et
al.,[16] the mean reductions from baseline at 24 (n =
14) and 36 months (n = 13) for liver volume were
14.5% and 17.5%, respectively, while the reductions
in spleen volume were 26.4% and 29.6%, respectively.[21,22]

mean organ volume reduction (%)

in the second study, by heitner et al.,[17] 18
patients from two centres were treated with  xxxd2645xxx  50mg three times daily for 6 months. seven of
these patients had undergone previous splenectomy.
the same study design was employed, including
dosage adjustment, to allow direct comparison with
the other noncomparative trial conducted by cox et
al. the lower initial dose of 50mg was assessed to
determine the lowest effective dose, since it had
been suggested that potential bone marrow toxicity
might explain the lower than expected haematological response with the higher 100mg dose used in the
cox et al. study. at the end of the study period, 16
patients continued to receive  xxxd2645xxx  in a 6-month
extension phase with dosages up to 100mg three
times daily, although most patients (n = 12) received
100mg twice daily.

haemoglobin and platelets
● there were no statistically significant changes
from baseline in mean haemoglobin concentrations
at 6 or 12 months in either study (–1.3 g/dl[17] or
value not reported[16] at 6 months; +0.26[16] or
+1.2[17] g/dl at 12 months). in patients from the cox
et al. study[16] who continued to receive  xxxd2645xxx

during the extended-use phase, mean haemoglobin
concentrations at 24 (n = 14) and 36 months (n = 13)
increased from baseline by 0.91 (p < 0.05) and 0.95
g/dl, respectively.[21-23]
mean platelet counts at 6 months were also not
significantly different from baseline in either study
(+2.0 × 109/l[17] or value not reported[16]). at 12
months, increases in platelet counts were statistically significant versus baseline in the higher dose
study (8.3 × 109/l, p = 0.014),[16] but not in the
lower dose study (14.7 × 109/l).[17] during extended
therapy, patients from the cox et al. study[16] displayed mean increases in platelet counts of 13.6 ×
109/l (p < 0.05) at 24 months (n = 14) and 22.2 ×
109/l at 36 months (n =13).[21-23]
●

plasma  xxxg444xxx 
● plasma  xxxg444xxx  activity declined slowly
throughout treatment in both studies, indicating a
progressive reduction in disease activity. the reduction from baseline in the cox et al. study was 16.4%
(p < 0.001) at 12 months,[16] while in the heitner et
al. study, the reductions were 6.6% at 6 months (p =
0.039) and 15.3% at 12 months (p < 0.001).[17]

quality of life

in the study by heitner et al.,[17] patient quality of
life was assessed at day 1, 3 months and 6 months
using the sf-36 quality of life questionnaire. this
questionnaire assesses quality of life in eight dimensions including physical function, role limitations
due to physical problems, bodily pain, general
health perceptions, vitality, social function, role limitations due to emotional problems and mental
health. at 6 months, patients receiving  xxxd2645xxx 
reported improvements in physical functioning (p =
0.052) and statistically significant improvements in
energy levels (p = 0.004). for the remaining parameters assessed, subjects either reported improvements of at least 5% (social functioning, role limitations due to physical problems) or little change.[24]
●

comparative study

in the only comparative study to date,[19,20] 36
patients who had been receiving intravenous ert
for at least 2 years were randomly assigned (nonblind) to either switch to  xxxd2645xxx  100mg three
times daily (n = 12) for 6 months, to receive  xxxd2645xxx  100mg three times daily in addition to ert (n =
12) or to continue on ert monotherapy (n = 12).
after 6 months of randomised therapy, all patients
were eligible to receive  xxxd2645xxx  monotherapy in an
extended-use phase.
● at 6 months, there were small decreases from
baseline in mean liver (3–5%) and spleen volumes
(5–9%) in patients receiving  xxxd2645xxx , either alone
or in combination. the changes in mean absolute
liver and spleen volumes were not significantly different between the three treatment groups. mean
haemoglobin concentrations were reduced slightly
from baseline in all three groups (0.5–2.4%), with
no significant differences between groups. however, mean platelet counts were significantly (p
value not stated) reduced from baseline in the  xxxd2645xxx  monotherapy group (–9.6%), compared with
increases in the ert (10.1%) and combination therapy groups (3.2%). additionally, reductions in
 xxxg444xxx  activity were significantly (p value
not stated) greater in the ert and combined therapy

mccormack & goa

groups, than in the  xxxd2645xxx  monotherapy
group.[19,20]
● analysis of a quality of life questionnaire (sf-36
with additional validated treatment-specific questions) demonstrated that patients receiving  xxxd2645xxx 
monotherapy reported significantly greater treatment convenience than those receiving ert (p =
0.028) and nonsignificant (p = 0.053) improvement
in overall treatment satisfaction compared with
those receiving ert. none of the patients receiving
 xxxd2645xxx  monotherapy reported less satisfaction
with treatment at 6 months relative to baseline.[19]
● of the 29 patients who entered the extended-use
phase, 22 were still receiving  xxxd2645xxx  monotherapy at 18 months, and none had reverted to ert.
reasons for withdrawal were related to  xxxd2645xxx 
tolerability rather than lack of efficacy (no further
details provided).[19] at 12 months, there were no
significant changes from baseline in liver or spleen
volume, or haemoglobin concentrations in any of
the three treatment group (as originally randomised).[20] there were non-significant reductions from
baseline in mean platelet counts in all three treatment groups. however, the reductions in platelet
counts between 6 and 12 months (the extension
period) were significant in the ert and combination
therapy groups (no data provided).[20]
4. tolerability
● diarrhoea is the most common adverse effect of
 xxxd2645xxx  therapy, occurring in >80% of patients. in
the three clinical trials discussed in section 3, diarrhoea occurred in 79%,[16] 94%[17] and 100%[19] of
patients. however, it was usually of mild-to-moderate severity, was often self-limiting and responded
well to treatment with loperamide or codeine phosphate. dosage increases resulted in transient recurrence of diarrhoea in two of three patients in one
study.[16] diarrhoea has been the reason for discontinuation of therapy in only approximately 5% of
patients in these clinical trials. other gastrointestinal
events occurring at much lower frequency include
flatulence, abdominal pain, nausea, constipation and
dyspepsia.[16-18,23]

drugs 2003; 63 (22)

 xxxd2645xxx : adis drug profile

2433

weight loss (defined as ≥5% of baseline values)[17] has been observed in approximately 60% of
 xxxd2645xxx  recipients, but is generally transient with
most patients stabilising or returning to baseline
bodyweight after 12 months.[17,18]

tility, although the effects are reversible.[27]  xxxd2645xxx  affects embryo/foetal survival in animals.[18]

● fine tremor of the hands or exacerbation of existing tremor has been reported in approximately
30% of  xxxd2645xxx  recipients.[17,18] the incidence of
fine tremor in the study by heitner et al. was 39%,
but it did not result in any treatment withdrawals.[17]
one patient in the  xxxd2645xxx  monotherapy treatment
arm withdrew from the comparative trial partly as a
result of developing transient tremor.[19] tremor was
not noted as a significant adverse event in the study
by cox et al.[16] in which patients received higher
doses of  xxxd2645xxx  than in the heitner et al. study.[17]

the recommended starting dose of  xxxd2645xxx  in
type 1 gaucher’s disease is 100mg orally three times
daily, with or without food, in adult patients under
the direction of physicians experienced in the treatment of gaucher’s disease. diarrhoea or tremor may
necessitate dosage reduction to 100mg once or twice
daily in some patients.[18,20]

●

other common adverse events reported only in
the heitner et al. study[17] were headache (50% of
patients) and flu-like symptoms (33%).
●

● two patients in the extension phase of the cox et
al. study[16] developed peripheral neuropathy. two
patients in the heitner et al. study[17] developed
neurological symptoms or abnormal electrodiagnostic findings after the 12-month assessment. in one of
these patients, the neuropathy was believed to be
secondary to concurrent vitamin b12 deficiency for
which the patient was non-compliant with medication.
● isolated cases of cognitive dysfunction have
been observed, but their relationship to  xxxd2645xxx 
therapy is not certain. the one publicised case[25]
involved an elderly patient who developed cognitive
dysfunction early in 2002, several months after stopping  xxxd2645xxx  therapy. the patient was originally
enrolled in 1998 in the cox et al. study[16] and had
continued to receive  xxxd2645xxx  in the extended treatment phase until october 2001. although a relationship to drug therapy appeared unlikely, all treatment
was withdrawn at the study site in israel as a precautionary measure. following a review of the clinical
data,  xxxd2645xxx  treatment was reinstated or continued uninterrupted at all clinical study sites.[26]
● studies in animals have indicated that  xxxd2645xxx 
may adversely affect spermatogenesis and male fer-

6.  xxxd2645xxx : current status
 xxxd2645xxx  has been approved in the eu, israel
and the us for the treatment of adult patients with
mild-to-moderate type 1 gaucher’s disease for
whom ert is unsuitable.
in clinical trials,  xxxd2645xxx  significantly reduced
organomegaly associated with mild-to-moderate
type 1 gaucher’s disease, but had only a limited
effect on the haematological signs of the disease.
switching patients from ert to  xxxd2645xxx  monotherapy was associated with decreases in platelet
counts. diarrhoea was the most frequent adverse
effect, with weight loss and tremor also being common. however, the adverse effects only infrequently
resulted in treatment withdrawal.
