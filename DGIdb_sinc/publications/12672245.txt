synthesis and pharmacology of site specific cocaine abuse treatment agents: 8-substituted isotropane (3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane) dopamine uptake in...  a series of 8-substituted-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octanes (isotropanes) were synthesized and tested for inhibitor potency using [(3)h]win 35,428 binding at the dopamine (da) transporter, [(3)h]citalopram binding at the serotonin (5-ht) transporter, and [(3)h]da uptake assays. the synthesis started with a mannich condensation of cyclopentanone,  xxxd314xxx , and fomaldehyde to afford n-benzyl-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-one (6). the 8-phenyl group was introduced by grignard addition to ketone 6 or nucleophilic displacement via a triflate of the corresponding alcohol 7a. the 8beta-phenyl-8alpha-alcohols from grignard addition generally have low affinity for the two transporters and do not effectively inhibit the uptake of [(3)h]da. the 8beta-phenyl compound (14) without the hydroxyl group at c-8 was much more potent (22-fold) for [(3)h]win 35,428 binding inhibition than the corresponding 8beta-phenyl-8alpha-hydroxy compound (7a). the 8alpha-phenyl compound 8a was almost as potent as cocaine in binding to the  xxxg2149xxx  (ic(50) = 234 nm vs 159 nm for cocaine), whereas the c-8 epimer, compound 14, was somewhat less potent (ic(50) = 785 nm). the lower potency of 14 (beta-orientation of 8-phenyl group) as compared to 8a (alpha-orientation) was unexpected, based on modeling studies comparing the new compounds to win 35,065-2, an analogue of cocaine. the benzhydryl ethers at c-8 (17), analogous to the benztropines, had better selectivity than the corresponding phenyl compounds, 8a and 14, for the  xxxg2149xxx  as compared to the 5-ht transporter. the isotropane and benzisotropine analogues seem to bind in a manner that is more similar to that of the benztropine compounds 5 rather than those of cocaine and win 35,065-2.
