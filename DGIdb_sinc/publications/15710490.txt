abstract
contradictory data on behavioral changes in mptp-treated c57bl/6 mice have been reported, even though the toxin-treated mice have
been widely used for non-clinical studies as an in vivo model of parkinson’s disease (pd). we found that the duration of immobility in the tail
suspension test (tst) was significantly increased in mptp-treated c57bl/6 mice as compared with control mice without a significant change
in the locomotor activity (la). dopamine (da) contents and protein levels of  xxxg2276xxx  and  xxxg2149xxx  in the striatum
were profoundly decreased in the toxin-treated mice. these behavioral and neurobiochemical changes were almost completely inhibited by a
pretreatment with deprenyl, a monoamine oxidase-b inhibitor. the stimulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission induced by l-dopa or a
 xxxg656xxx  agonist ameliorated the increase in immobility time. threshold level of striatal da that produced the increase in
immobility time in mptp-treated mice was estimated to be between 11 and 27% of control level. we concluded that the increase in
immobility time in the tst was induced by the nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration and was thought to be a consequence of motor
dysfunction in this mouse model of pd.

1. introduction
the discovery of the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (mptp) has greatly contributed
to understanding of the pathogenesis of parkinson’s disease
(pd) (langston et al., 1983). the neurotoxic effects of
mptp are thought to be mediated by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (mpp+), an oxidative product of mptp
converted by monoamine oxidase-b (mao-b) (heikkila
et al., 1984b). mpp+ has a high affinity for the dopamine
transporter (dat) (javitch et al., 1985), and causes
mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress (nicklas
et al., 1987; tipton and singer, 1993). thus, the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons is led either by necrosis or

apoptosis (tipton and singer, 1993; gerlach and riederer,
1996; przedborski and jackson-lewis, 1998; przedborski
et al., 2000).
this toxin has been reported to induce clinical,
biochemical, and pathological features similar to those
observed in idiopathic parkinsonism and used to create an
animal model for pd in rodents and nonhuman primates
(gerlach and riederer, 1996; speciale, 2002). especially,
the c57bl/6 mouse strain is known to be highly susceptible
to the neurotoxin, and the mptp-treated mice have been
widely used as an in vivo model to test therapeutic strategies
in pd (heikkila et al., 1984a; saitoh et al., 1987; sundstrom
et al., 1987; gupta and wiener, 1995; tomac et al., 1995;
przedborski et al., 1996; steiner et al., 1997; mitsumoto
et al., 1998; sedelis et al., 2000). however, the behavioral
effects of mptp lesioning in c57bl/6 mice are less marked
than those seen in nonhuman primates because mice do not
develop typical parkinsonism (dauer and przedborski,

2003). furthermore, although a variety of behavioral
paradigms for several symptoms have been examined,
contradictory data on behavioral changes in mptp-treated
c57bl/6 mice have been reported (sedelis et al., 2001).
several reasons for the discrepancy in mice behavior were
pointed out by sedelis et al. (2001) as follows: differences in
gender, the sources of mice, intoxication protocol, experimental schedules, e.g. the time point for the evaluation after
intoxication, and experimental conditions including application systems for the evaluation.
the tail suspension test (tst) using mice was originally
established by steru et al. (1985) as a screening procedure
for evaluating the antidepressant activity of drugs. the basic
concept of this test called ‘‘searching-waiting strategy’’ can
be explained by alteration between two kinds of behaviors,
agitation and immobility, when mice were placed in
insoluble and aversive situations. we thought that this
behavioral test could be applied to evaluation of motor
function in mptp-treated mice because change of the
parameter in the tst depends on not only emotional
behavior but also motor activity.
in the present study, we employed the tst for evaluation
of motor impairment in the mptp-treated pd mouse model
and found the significant increase in immobility time in the
mouse model. to determine whether the phenomenon
reflects the motor dysfunction caused by degeneration of
nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, we comprehensively
analyzed the characteristics of the mptp-treated mice by
using neurochemical, immunochemical, and pharmacological techniques.

2. materials and methods
2.1. animals
male c57bl/6 mice (10–12 weeks old, charles river
japan inc., atsugi, japan) were used for this study. they had
free access to food and water, and were maintained in a 12 h
light/dark cycle (lights on 7:00–19:00). experiments were
performed in accordance with ‘‘the guidelines for animal
experimentation in otsuka pharmaceutical co., ltd.’’
2.2. drug preparation and administration
deprenyl, bromocriptine mesylate, and sulpiride were
purchased from research biochemicals inc. (ma, usa),
biomol research laboratories inc. (pa, usa), and
fujisawa pharmaceutical co., ltd. (dogmatyl1, osaka,
japan), respectively. all other compounds were purchased
from sigma-aldrich (mo, usa). mptp hydrochloride at a
dose of 20 mg/kg was dissolved in saline and administered
four times intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 2 h intervals. for
analysis of dose response in mptp intoxication, only the
administration frequency was changed (1–4 injections of
20 mg/kg i.p. at 2 h intervals). all evaluations were carried

out at 3 days after the toxin administration. deprenyl
(2.5 mg/kg) was dissolved in saline and administered i.p. at
18 h before the first administration of mptp. l-dopa methyl
ester with carbidopa, a peripheral l-aromatic amino acid
decarboxylase inhibitor, in a constant ratio of 10:1 was
dissolved in 5% gum-arabic saline solution. bromocriptine
mesylate was dissolved in traces of methanol and diluted in
water (final methanol concentration: 10%). sulpiride was
diluted with saline and administered 30 min before
bromocriptine administration. doses were calculated as
the free base and given in a volume of 10 ml/kg.
2.3. behavioral analysis
in the measurement of locomotor activity (la), mice
were individually placed in a plastic circular chamber
(20 cm in diameter and 20 cm high). after being placed in
the chamber for 30 min, the la was measured for 120 min
every 15 min, as described below. a pivot was fixed at the
center of each chamber, where the animal was placed, and
six microswitches were fitted beneath the perimeter.
locomotor movement of the animals generated a pulse
by switching the microswitch and electrically charging a
magnetic counter. the counts of the movement were
calculated by a computer. the tst was originally described
by steru et al. (1985), and was performed as described
previously with a minor modification (mori et al., 2002).
the apparatus was a four-channel devise composed of an
electric balance, an a/d converter, a testing box
(30 cm  25 cm  25 cm), and a personal computer (yamashita giken co., tokushima, japan). the mouse was
suspended from a hook by an attachment, which was
applied 15 mm from the tip of the tail (fig. 1). the duration
of immobility was measured by the computer for a period of
6 min just after suspension. when mice climbed their tails
up to the attachment or dropped from the attachment during
the test session, the data were omitted. the experiments
were carried out in a soundproof room.
2.4. western blot analysis
western blot analysis was performed as described
previously with a minor modification (nakai et al., 2003).
the striatal tissues were homogenized in hepes-buffered
sucrose solution (0.32 m sucrose containing 4 mg/ml
pepstatin, 5 mg/ml aprotinin, 20 mg/ml  xxxd207xxx ,
4 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride,
2 mm edta, 2 mm egta, and 20 mm hepes, ph 7.2)
using a microtube homogenizer. protein concentrations were
determined using a bca kit (pierce, il, usa). the
homogenates were solubilized in laemmli’s sample buffer.
twenty micrograms of protein from each sample were
separated on 10% sds-page gel using constant current.
separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride (pvdf) membranes (millipore,
ma, usa) for 1.5 h with a semi-dry blotting system. the

2.0) after capturing the digital images with bio-rad gs700 imaging densitometer. the protein levels of th and
dat per striatal protein were calculated as a ratio with a1
subunit of na+/k+-atpase and actin, respectively.
2.5. neurochemical analysis
neurochemical analysis was performed as described
previously with a minor modification (mitsumoto et al.,
1998). each mouse was sacrificed by exposure to microwave. after removing the whole brain from the skull, the
striatum were carefully isolated. the tissue was immediately
weighed and stored at 80 8c until assay. each sample was
homogenized in a 0.1 n perchloric acid solution containing
 xxxd2401xxx , an internal standard, using an ultrasonic
disrupter (model ur-200p, tomy seiko co., ltd., tokyo,
japan) under ice cooling. the homogenate was centrifuged
at 20,000  g for 15 min at 4 8c. dopamine (da) contents
in the supernatant were assayed using a hplc system
(gilson unipoint, m&s instruments trading inc., osaka,
japan) equipped with an electrochemical detector (eicom
ecd-100, eicom corp., kyoto, japan) on a separation
column (eicompak sc-5ods, 15 cm  3 mm i.d, eicom
corp.). the mobile phase, ph 3.5, consisted of 0.1 m citric
acid/0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, 190 mg/l sodium-1octane-sulfonate, 5 mg/l, 2na edta, and 15% (v/v)
methanol. the flow rate was set at 0.5 ml/min. the electrode
potential was set at +0.75 v against ag/agcl reference
electrode potential. striatal da contents were calculated as
nanogram per gram of tissue wet weight and expressed as %
of control level.

pvdf membranes were incubated for 1 h at room
temperature with tris-buffered saline containing 0.1%
tween 20 (tbst) and 5% skim milk, followed by overnight
incubation at 4 8c with the desired antibodies. the rabbit
polyclonal antibody against the  xxxg2276xxx  (th,

antibody against the a1 subunit of the na+/k+-atpase
(c464.6, upstate biotechnology, ny, usa), the rat
monoclonal antibody against the dat (mab369, chemicon), and the mouse monoclonal antibody against the actin
(mab1501, chemicon) were diluted in tbst containing
3% skim milk (1:1000 for all primary antibodies).
membranes were washed three times for 10 min at room
temperature and incubated with a horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody in tbst containing 3%
skim milk for 1 h. immunoreactivity was detected by
enhanced chemiluminescent autoradiography (ecl kit,
amersham, il, usa) in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions. the densities of immunoreactive bands were
analyzed by an image analysis software (molecular analyst

2.6. immunohistochemical analysis
brains were removed from the skull and stored at 80 8c
until sections were cut. cryostat-cut sections (10 mm) were
prepared from the brain on a sliding microtome and mounted
on coated slides. the sections were fixed for 10 min at 4 8c
with 4% paraformaldehyde. th- and dat-immunohistochemistry were performed using specific antibodies to each
protein as used in western blotting. both the anti-th rabbit
polyclonal antibody and the anti-dat rat monoclonal
antibody were diluted at 1:50. th- and dat-immunoreactivity were visualized using dako1 liquid dab
large volume substrate-chromogen system (dako corp., ca, usa) with dako envision+tm system (dako corp.) and n-histofine1
simple stain max po (r) (nichirei corp., tokyo, japan),
respectively. all sections were viewed using olympus
inverted microscope ix70.

3.2. effect of a mao-b inhibitor on mptp-induced
behavioral and neurochemical changes

3.1. effects of mptp treatment on the la and immobility
time in the tst
after a 30 min acclimatization period, la was assessed
in tilting-cages by recording counts every 15 min for 2 h.
there were no significant differences between control and
mptp-treated mice both in each time point (fig. 2a) and in
total for 2 h. the counts for la in the initial 10 min during
acclimatization, as an activity index in a novel environment,
were not different in two groups (control mice:
285.8  23.1, mptp-treated mice: 320.1  39.1, data are
mean  s.e.m., n = 10). on the other hand, we found
behavioral change in mptp-treated mice using the tst at 3
days after mptp treatment. in mptp-treated mice, the
immobility time during a 6 min period was significantly
increased as compared with control mice (fig. 2b). this
significant behavioral change was also observed  xxxd2274xxx  days
after the toxin treatment (immobility time (s) in control

we analyzed the relationship between the increased
immobility time in the tst and the dopaminergic
neurodegeneration by using deprenyl, a selective mao-b
inhibitor. it has been previously shown that a pretreatment
with deprenyl protect dopaminergic neurons from mptpinduced damages by blocking conversion of mptp to its
active metabolite mpp+ by irreversibly inhibiting mao-b
(heikkila et al., 1984b). deprenyl (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) was
administered 18 h before the first administration of mptp
and the evaluation was performed at 3 days after mptp
treatment. in the tst, the increased immobility time in
mptp-treated mice was completely inhibited by a
pretreatment with deprenyl (fig. 3a). deprenyl alone did
not affect the immobility time in the control mice. we also
confirmed that the drug could protect dopaminergic neurons
from mptp neurotoxicity by immunochemical detection of
striatal th protein levels. western blots showing relative
levels of th protein in the striatum demonstrated that the
remarkable loss of th protein levels in mptp-treated mice
completely inhibited by a pretreatment with deprenyl
(fig. 3b). a1 subunit of na+/k+-atpase protein was
detected as a house keeping protein to confirm that equal
amounts of protein were loaded in each lane (taha et al.,
1995; nakai et al., 2003). decrease in striatal dat protein
level was also inhibited by a pretreatment with deprenyl
(data not shown). in addition, although the da contents in
the striatum were significantly decreased by mptp
administration, this neurochemical change was also almost
completely inhibited by a pretreatment with deprenyl
(fig. 3c). these results indicate that the increase in duration
of immobility in the tst could be caused by mptp-induced
dopaminergic injury.
3.3. the degree of mptp-induced dopaminergic
neurotoxicity versus immobility time in the tst

fig. 2. comparison of behavioral output between control and mptptreated mice. four doses of mptp (20 mg/kg, i.p.) were given to male
c57bl/6 mice at 2-h intervals. the evaluation was performed at 3 days after
mptp administration. (a) the la was assessed in tilting-cages by recording counts every 15 min for 2 h. data are mean  s.e.m., n = 10). (b) in the

group (n = 9); mptp-treated group (n = 10). *p < 0.05 vs. control group

next we analyzed the relationship between the expression of the increased immobility time in the tst and the
damages of striatal dopaminergic neurons by examining the
dose response in mptp intoxication. one to four doses of
mptp (20 mg/kg, i.p.) were given to mice at 2 h intervals.
the duration of immobility in the tst was significantly
increased only at the four injections (4  20 mg/kg) of
mptp as compared with control mice (fig. 4a). each
treatment did not affect the counts of the la in mice (data
not shown). striatal da contents were decreased at dosedependent manner (fig. 4b). significant decrease in striatal
da contents was observed in all mptp treatments and four

i.p.) were given to male c57bl/6 mice at 2-h intervals. deprenyl (2.5 mg/
kg, i.p.), a selective mao-b inhibitor, was administered 18 h before the first
treatment of mptp. (a) in the tst, the total duration of immobility was
measured, and the immobility time was recorded during a 6 min period.
data are mean  s.e.m. (n = 10). *p < 0.05 vs. control group, #p < 0.05
vs. mptp-treated group (two-tailed t-test). (b) striatal th and a1 subunit of
na+/k+-atpase protein levels in mice were analyzed by the western
blotting. striatal homogenates were prepared from 5, 6 and 8 mice for
control, mptp-treated and deprenyl + mptp-treated groups, respectively.
(c) the da contents in striatum were measured by hplc-ecd. data are
mean  s.e.m. and expressed as % of control. control group (n = 9);
mptp-treated group (n = 9); depremyl + mptp-treated group (n = 9);
deprenyl-treated group (n = 9). **p < 0.01 vs. control group, ##p < 0.01
vs. mptp-treated group (two-tailed t-test). the striatal da contents in
control mice were 13,185  303 ng/g tissue weight.

injections of mptp caused 84% decrease in da contents.
western blots and concomitant densitometric analyses of th
and dat protein levels in the striatum also showed the dosedependent decreases (fig. 4c, d). in the densitometric
analyses of dat protein, actin protein was used as a house
keeping protein to confirm that equal amounts of proteins
were loaded in each lane (nakai et al., 2003). these
observations were also confirmed by immunohistochemical
analysis that represented the dose-dependent decreases in
striatal th- or dat-immunoreactivity, and striking dopaminergic degeneration was observed at two, three or four
injections of mptp (fig. 4e).

we examined the effects of bromocriptine, a dopamine
 xxxg656xxx  agonist, on the tst in mptp-treated mice to
know if the stimulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission
could improve the behavioral change. bromocriptine (3 or
10 mg/kg) was administered i.p., 2 h prior to the tst.
mptp-induced increase in immobility time was dosedependently decreased by a bromocriptine treatment and
was returned to near control level by 10 mg/kg injection
(fig. 5a). although 3 mg/kg injection of bromocriptine did
not affect the la, 10 mg/kg injection led to the gradual
increase in the la and statistically significant increase was
observed at the last period (105–120 min) as compared with
that in vehicle-injected mice (fig. 5b). in the analysis using
normal mice, 10 mg/kg bromocriptine injection showed the
significant decrease in immobility time in the tst as
compared with that in control mice. similar to the result in
the la of mptp-treated mice, 10 mg/kg bromocriptine
injection significantly increased the la in a range from 75 to
120 min as compared with that in control mice (data not
shown).
in addition, the effect of 10 mg/kg bromocriptine
injection on the decrease in immobility time of mptptreated mice in the tst was completely inhibited by
sulpiride, a  xxxg656xxx  antagonist, pretreatment
(fig. 5c). sulpiride alone did not affect the immobility time
of mptp-treated mice in the tst. from these data, it was
confirmed that stimulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission ameliorated the mptp-induced behavioral change
observed in the tst with the dose in which la was
significantly increased.

3.5. effects of l-dopa on the la, immobility time in the tst
and striatal da level in mptp-treated mice
to further elucidate the relationship between the increase
in immobility time in the tst and striatal da level, we
examined the effects of l-dopa, a dopamine precursor, on the
tst in mptp-treated mice. l-dopa (30 or 100 mg/kg) was
administered with 1/10 dose of carbidopa, a peripheral dopa
decarboxylase inhibitor, i.p. 1 h prior to the tst. only
100 mg/kg injection of l-dopa returned the increased
immobility time to control level in mptp-treated mice
(fig. 6a). in the la, 100 mg/kg, not 30 mg/kg, injection led
to the gradual increase, and statistically significant increase
was observed in a range from 30 to 120 min as compared
with that in vehicle-injected mice (fig. 6b). these results
indicate that, similar to the case of bromocriptine, l-dopa
administration ameliorated the mptp-induced behavioral
change observed in the tst with the dose in which the la
was significantly increased. in the analysis of the tst or the
la using normal mice, neither 30 nor 100 mg/kg injection
of l-dopa caused any changes (data not shown).

neurochemical changes by l-dopa administration to

after administration, respectively (fig. 6c).

4. discussion
in the present study, we used the same mptp treatment
protocol as described by duan or jackson-lewis (jackson-

lewis et al., 1995; duan and mattson, 1999; duan et al.,
1999), in which mice received 4 i.p. injections of 20 mg/kg
mptp at 2 h intervals, because their studies showed a
remarkable and stable destruction of dopaminergic neurons
in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the mptp-treated
mice  xxxd2274xxx  days after mptp treatment. similarly, we also
previously demonstrated that severe and reproducible
dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the mouse striatum
was observed at 3 days as well as 7 days after mptp
treatment with the same degree as measured by th and dat
protein levels (striatal th protein: 3  2% of control mice at

3 days, 9  8% of control mice  xxxd2274xxx  days; striatal dat

control mice  xxxd2274xxx  days. data are mean  s.d., n = 5, 6 and 4
for control, 3 and 7 days, respectively.). however, we
decided to set the evaluation point at the earlier day after
mptp treatment for the behavioral experiments to avoid
the influence of functional recovery on dopaminergic
neurotransmissin (ho and blum, 1998; mitsumoto et al.,
1998). in the present study, we have confirmed key features
in mptp-treated mice that da nerve terminals in the
striatum were lost immunochemically (fig 4c, d) and that
striatal da contents were obviously depleted (figs. 3c, 4b
and 6c).
so far, the la is the most commonly used index to
measure the alterations of behavioral activity after mptp
treatment. while some authors reported a reduction of
spontaneous la in mptp-treated mice (arai et al., 1990;
fredriksson et al., 1997), others reported no motor deficit
(willis and donnan, 1987; nishi et al., 1991; itzhak et al.,
1999) or even a hyperactivity (colotla et al., 1990; chia
et al., 1996). as we showed here, itzhak et al. (1999) also
demonstrated that the la as measured using a different
apparatus from that we used was not affected by mptp
intoxication, which was the same protocol as ours. a
plausible explanation for a failure in the detection of
mptp-induced reduction on the la may relate to
compensatory mechanisms by non-dopaminergic systems.
for instance, it has been reported that serotonergic system
could participate in the increased locomotor movement in
mptp-treated mice (chia et al., 1996). therefore, it is not
easy to use the la as an index for motor dysfunction in this
mouse model.
on the other hand, we found a behavioral change in the
mouse model using the tst at both 3 (fig. 2b) and 7 days
after the 4 injections (4  20 mg/kg) of mptp treatment. this is the first report applying the tst for the
behavioral evaluation in mptp-treated mice and showing a
behavioral change using the evaluation system. to
investigate the relationship between the behavioral change
and nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration, we performed
two examinations. firstly, the increased immobility time
in the tst was completely inhibited by a pretreatment
with deprenyl in mptp-treated mice (fig. 3a). secondly,
dopaminergic stimulants, bromocriptine and l-dopa, ameliorated the mptp-induced behavioral change observed in
the tst (figs. 5a, c and 6c). from these findings, we
verified that the increase in the duration of immobility in
the tst was caused by nigrostriatal dopaminergic injury
and the concomitant abnormal dopamine transmission in
mptp-treated mice. in addition, the finding that the la
was significantly increased by the dopaminergic stimulants
in mptp-treated mice at each effective dose in the tst
(figs. 5b and 6b) directly demonstrated that an improvement of motor function induced by the stimulants via
postsynaptic dopamine receptors was involved in the
ameliorative effects on the duration of immobility time.

furthermore, the increased immobility time in the tst
was not exactly correlated with degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, and the duration of immobility in the tst
was significantly increased only at the four injections
(4  20 mg/kg) of mptp as compared with control mice
(fig. 4a–e). although the precise reasons for this
phenomenon remain unknown, the existence of some
compensatory mechanisms and threshold for expressing the
behavioral change in the tst can be considered. several
possible mechanisms of compensation, such as an elevated
da turnover of remaining cells, a hyperactivity of
postsynaptic da receptors, or a nondopaminergic neurotransmission have been reported in mptp-treated mice
(sershen et al., 1987; weihmuller et al., 1988; wiener et al.,
1989; yurek et al., 1989; schroeder et al., 1997; rozas
et al., 1998; schwarting et al., 1999). on the other hand, in
human pd, a loss of >80% in striatal da content is
commonly assumed to be necessary to observe symptoms
(bernheimer et al., 1973; riederer and wuketich, 1976;
agid, 1991; lang and lozano, 1998). in our study, from the
result of da contents after l-dopa administration, the
threshold level of striatal dopamine that produced the
increase in immobility time was estimated to be between 11
and 27% of control level (fig. 6c). taken together, these
results suggest that the increase in immobility time induced
by mptp treatment in mice depends on striatal dopaminergic neurodegenration, and it is expressed in the same
manner as pd in terms of striatal da level, although the
behavioral change in the tst is different from neurological
symptoms observed in pd. in addition, we could not
exclude the tst might detect any emotional or psychological deficits in this mouse model. therefore, the possible
contribution of other neurotransmitters, such as serotonin
and noradrenaline, to the behavioral change is currently
under investigation.
in conclusion, the present comprehensive study demonstrates that the increase in immobility time in the tst results
from the nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration induced
by mptp, and the increase in immobility time could reflect a
motor dysfunction. this observation strongly suggests that
the decrement in da content under the threshold level
causes a motor dysfunction in mice. in recent years, there
has been an enormous demand for further scientific
development of animal models that can faithfully mimic
the motor impairment in idiopathic pd. here we propose
that the tst is a very useful method to evaluate compounds,
which act in a stimulative, neuroprotective, or neurorestorative way, on dopaminergic neurons in mptp-treated
mouse model of pd.
