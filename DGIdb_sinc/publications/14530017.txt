background. among the serine proteases, neutrophil
elastase is a powerful cytotoxic enzyme and plays a
pivotal role in the inflammatory response associated with
cardiopulmonary bypass. this study assesses the effects
of the specific inhibition of  xxxg694xxx  by a
novel, potent, low-molecular-weight  xxxg694xxx 
inhibitor,  xxxd2162xxx . we hypothesized that  xxxd2162xxx 
reduces inflammatory mediators and modulates adhesion
molecules and the deformability of neutrophils during
simulated extracorporeal circulation.
methods. simulated extracorporeal circulation was established by recirculating fresh heparinized (3.75 u/ml)
human blood for 120 minutes in a membrane oxygenator
and a roller pump with and without 1.0 ␮mol/l of
 xxxd2162xxx  (n ⴝ 9 for control group, n ⴝ 7 for  xxxd2162xxx 
group). the neutrophil adhesion molecules,  xxxg1206xxx  and
l-selectin, and the cytoplasmic f-actin of neutrophils
were measured by flow cytometry. neutrophil deformability was evaluated using simulated silicon microcapillaries.  xxxg694xxx ,  xxxg562xxx , and  xxxg285xxx -9
were measured using enzyme immunoassay.

results.  xxxg694xxx  levels were significantly
lower in the  xxxd2162xxx  group.  xxxd2162xxx  significantly
reduced  xxxg562xxx  and  xxxg285xxx -9 production.  xxxd2162xxx 
did not modulate changes of  xxxg1206xxx  and l-selectin during recirculation. cytoplasmic f-actin content and
changes of neutrophil deformability did not significantly
differ between the groups.
conclusions. inhibition of  xxxg694xxx  activity
with  xxxd2162xxx  reduces further  xxxg562xxx  production
and the formation of the complement membrane attack
complex, and this results in a reduction of neutrophil
elastase levels during simulated extracorporeal circulation. this study suggests that specific  xxxg694xxx 
inhibition with  xxxd2162xxx  is a feasible therapeutic option to attenuate the exaggerated inflammatory response
associated with cardiopulmonary bypass.

[1].  xxxg694xxx  degrades connective tissue components such as elastin, proteoglycan, fibronectin, and
collagen [2], and therefore may cause severe tissue damage and multiple organ dysfunction.
 xxxd2162xxx , a low-molecular-weight compound
(c23h28n6o4; molecular weight, 452.51), is a specific,
reversible, nonpeptide  xxxg694xxx  inhibitor. the
inhibitory activity of  xxxd2162xxx  (ki value) against human
 xxxg694xxx  is 12.16 nmol/l. the half-life of the
drug is approximately 2 to 3 hours. this agent competitively inhibits  xxxg694xxx  in humans, rats, and
hamsters, but does not inhibit other proteases such as
pancreatic elastase, trypsin,  xxxg1855xxx ,  xxxg552xxx , or
matrix metalloproteinases [3]. it has been reported that
 xxxd2162xxx  inhibits acute lung injury induced by  xxxg694xxx  in rats, minimizing lung hemorrhage and
the accumulation of neutrophils in the lung [4].
this study assesses the effects of the specific inhibition
of  xxxg694xxx  by  xxxd2162xxx  in a simulated extracorporeal circulation (secc) model. we measured

ardiopulmonary bypass (cpb) is known to induce a
whole body inflammatory reaction that is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in cardiac
surgery. during cpb, activated blood components are
thought to be intertwined and form a vicious network,
which contributes to the inflammatory response. activated neutrophils play a central role in this circle of the
inflammatory cascade, which involves a contact system, a
complement system, cytokines, most of the blood cells,
and endothelium. activated neutrophils induce tissue
injury by the release of toxic oxygen species and granule
contents including  xxxg694xxx . among a number
of serine proteases,  xxxg694xxx  is one of the most
powerful cytotoxic enzymes because of its biologic effects

material and methods
simulated extracorporeal circulation involved a spiral
coil membrane oxygenator (model 60ec, surface area, 0.6
m2; mera, inc, tokyo, japan), a polyvinyl chloride venous reservoir bag (mera), silastic tubing (1/4- and
3/8-inch inner diameter), polycarbonate connectors, and
a barely occlusive roller head pump (model ms-033;
mera). each circuit was primed with 250 ml of fresh
human blood without dilution. blood was obtained from
healthy, fasting volunteers, who abstained from all medication for at least 2 weeks before donation. one donor
was used for each individual bypass. written informed
consent was obtained from donors, and the protocol was
approved by the institutional review board of the university of tsukuba. in the control (standard heparin)
group (n ⫽ 9), blood was drawn directly into a reservoir
bag containing standard heparin (3.75 u/ml) and dextrose (2.25 mg/ml). in the  xxxd2162xxx  group (n ⫽ 7), the
reservoir bag contained heparin (3.75 u/ml), dextrose
(2.25 mg/ml), and  xxxd2162xxx  (final concentration of 1.0
␮mol/l blood).  xxxd2162xxx  was a generous gift from ono
pharmaceutical co, osaka, japan. each individual circuit
was used only once and then discarded. blood was
recirculated for 120 minutes at 400 ml/min with the
blood temperature maintained at 37°c by immersing the
reservoir bag in a constant-temperature shaking water
bath. the oxygenator was ventilated with 95% oxygen–5% carbon dioxide at a rate of 1.0 l/min. preliminary
experiments confirmed that the ph of the circulating
blood was maintained from 7.3 to 7.5 and that the
activated clotting time was more than 500 seconds
throughout the experiment. the circuit pressure was not
measured or controlled.
blood samples were obtained for analysis from each
donor before any anticoagulant was introduced (donor
sample), from the reservoir bag before beginning recirculation (0 minutes), and at 30, 60, and 120 minutes of
recirculation. additionally, a standing control sample
(3.75 u/ml heparin and 2.25 mg/ml dextrose with or
without  xxxd2162xxx ) was collected from the reservoir bag
and incubated for 120 minutes at 37°c. blood samples for
analysis were obtained with either 3.8% acid-citratedextrose (for  xxxg1206xxx , l-selectin, f-actin, and microchannel analysis, 9:1 by volume) or 1.0% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta-2na; for  xxxg694xxx , il-8,
and  xxxg285xxx -9). blood collected with 1.0% edta-2na was
centrifuged immediately for 15 minutes at 2,000 g at 4°c.
the plasma was then divided into aliquots and stored at

yoshimura et al
 xxxd2162xxx  in cardiopulmonary bypass

1235

⫺80°c for subsequent measurements. samples for cell
counts were collected in edta-2na tubes (3.0 mg of
edta-2na per 2.0 ml of blood). the plasma concentration of  xxxd2162xxx  was not measured in this study.

blood cell counts
blood cell counts were performed using a counter (t-660;
coulter electronics, hialeah, fl), and differential white
cell counts were made on wright’s stained blood smears
by an experienced independent observer. leukocyte and
neutrophil counts were expressed as a percentage of the
donor values.

 xxxg694xxx ,  xxxg562xxx , and  xxxg285xxx -9 assay
plasma  xxxg694xxx  in a complex with ␣1-protease
inhibitor was determined by an activating immunization
method (merck diagnostica, darmstadt, germany) with
an automated homogeneous enzyme immunoassay. enzyme-linked immunoassay for il-8 was performed using
commercially available kits (pierce endogen, rockford,
il). terminal complement complex  xxxg285xxx -9 was measured
by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (quidel, san
diego, ca). the sensitivity limit of each assay undertaken was as follows:  xxxg694xxx , 25 ng/ml; il-8,
2 pg/ml;  xxxg285xxx -9, 16 ng/ml.

adhesion molecules assay
changes in the surface expression of l-selectin and
 xxxg1206xxx  of neutrophils were measured using flow cytometry as previously described [5]. one hundred microliters
of whole blood samples were incubated for 30 minutes
with 2 mg/ml of fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc)–
conjugated cd62l antibody (pharmingen, san diego,
ca) and 1 mg/ml of phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse
monoclonal anti-human  xxxg1206xxx  antibody (dako laboratories, copenhagen, denmark) at 4°c. identical samples were incubated with fitc-conjugated mouse immunoglobin g (dako laboratories) and phycoerythrinconjugated mouse immunoglobin g2a (dako
laboratories) for negative control. the erythrocytes were
lysed with immuno-lyse, and leukocytes were fixed with
immuno-fix (coulter clone, hialeah, fl). neutrophils
were identified using the typical forward and side-scatter
pattern, and the expression of l-selectin and  xxxg1206xxx  was
measured as the mean fluorescent intensity of 5,000 cells.
l-selectin and  xxxg1206xxx  changes were expressed as the
percentage changes compared to the donor value.

f-actin content assay
a 50-␮l sample was fixed with formaldehyde, and the
cells were permeabilized using intraprep (immunotech
coulter, marseilles, france). neutrophils were stained
for 30 minutes at 37°c with 1 u of bodipy fl phallacidin
(molecular probes inc, eugene, or). cells were washed
with phosphate-buffered saline solution, and the f-actin
content was measured using a flow cytometer (facs
calibur, becton dickinson, franklin lakes, nj) as previously described [5]. the change in f-actin content was
expressed as the percentage change from the donor
value.

neutrophil deformability assay
the transit time of the whole blood through the microchannel array was measured as a surrogate marker of
neutrophil deformability. the detailed procedures and
apparatus (microchannel array flow analyzer, mcfan, type kh-2; hitachi haramachi electronics, co,
hitachi, japan) for this analysis have been previously
described [6, 7]. in short, microgrooves formed in the
surface of a single crystal silicon substrate were converted to leakproof microchannels by tightly covering
them with an optical flat glass plate. the microgrooves in
the silicon-made microchannel chip (bloody-3s, 2600
channels; width, 6 ␮m; depth, 4.5 ␮m; length, 10 ␮m;
hitachi haramachi electronics), which are close to the
size of capillaries, were prefilled with saline. whole
blood samples collected with 3.8% acid-citrate-dextrose
were diluted with phosphate-buffered saline solution (1:1
by volume), and the suspension was made to flow
through the microchannels under a pressure difference
of 10 cm h2o. the transit time for each 100-␮l suspension was determined to assess the filterability of the
whole blood. these measurements were performed immediately after blood sampling, keeping the room temperature at 20° to 25°c. results were expressed as a
percentage of the transit time of the donor samples.

statistical analysis
all values are expressed as mean ⫾ standard error of the
mean. one-way analysis of variance as compared with
the donor value was used for within group comparison.
comparison of two groups as a function of time was
performed by two-way analysis of variance with repeated
measures. data were further compared by the use of the

bonferroni test if analysis of variance was significant (p ⬍
0.05).

results
changes in measured blood and plasma constituents and
microchannel transit times during experiments are
shown in table 1. the hematocrit value (data not shown)
did not change significantly in either group throughout
the recirculation. by 120 minutes of recirculation, leukocyte and neutrophil counts significantly decreased to
approximately 86% to 92% of the donor value in both the
control and the  xxxd2162xxx  groups, but there were no
significant differences between the groups with time.
plasma  xxxg694xxx  levels showed a significant
10-fold increase at 120 minutes of recirculation (p ⬍
0.0001) in the control group.  xxxd2162xxx  significantly
reduced this increase of  xxxg694xxx . there were
significant differences between the two groups at 30, 60,
and 120 minutes of recirculation (fig 1; p ⫽ 0.036, p ⫽
0.027, and p ⫽ 0.021, respectively).
plasma il-8 levels increased significantly from 7.5 ⫾
3.7 to 175.0 ⫾ 47.2 pg/ml by 120 minutes of recirculation
(p ⫽ 0.0053) in the control group, whereas the  xxxd2162xxx 
group showed a significant but smaller increase of il-8
levels from 6.8 ⫾ 1.6 to 36.1 ⫾ 7.4 pg/ml by 120 minutes
(p ⫽ 0.0023). significant differences were noted between
the two groups at 60 and 120 minutes of recirculation (fig

complement  xxxg285xxx -9 levels increased significantly from
36.1 ⫾ 7.4 to 1142.7 ⫾ 135.0 ng/ml by 120 minutes of
recirculation (p ⬍ 0.0001) in the control group. increase of
 xxxg285xxx -9 levels was attenuated in the  xxxd2162xxx  group.

comment
on the basis of preliminary in vitro studies in human
plasma that indicate that  xxxd2162xxx  inhibits the activity
of  xxxg694xxx  in a dose-dependent fashion at
doses of 0.1 to 10.0 ␮mol/l (50% inhibitory concentration
of 0.403 ␮mol/l) at 37°c (unpublished data), we decided
to use an initial blood concentration of 1.0 ␮mol/l in this

also demonstrate that  xxxd2162xxx  does not affect release
of  xxxg694xxx  from neutrophils. hence, reduction
of plasma  xxxg694xxx  levels in the  xxxd2162xxx 
group observed in this study is not thought to be the
direct effect of this agent. in addition to tissue damage,
 xxxg694xxx  promotes chemotaxis activation of
neutrophils and expression of neutrophil adhesion molecules [8].  xxxg694xxx  also has the important
biologic activity of inducing il-8 [9], which can again
stimulate the degranulation of neutrophils. in the present
study, inhibition of  xxxg694xxx  activity with
 xxxd2162xxx  led to reduction of il-8, and probably prevented further neutrophil degranulation by il-8 or  xxxg694xxx  itself. thus, it could have resulted in
reduction of  xxxg694xxx  levels.
 xxxg562xxx  is produced predominantly by activated
neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and t cells. the
elevation of plasma il-8 levels has been shown during
and after clinical cpb [10, 11], and is associated with
cardiac and pulmonary dysfunction after cpb [12]. the
delayed increase of il-8 at 120 minutes of secc observed
in our study is consistent with previous in vivo [10, 11]
and in vitro [13] studies. the effects of il-8 on human
neutrophils are not only chemotaxis and release of storage enzymes such as  xxxg694xxx  but also expression of surface adhesion molecules and production of
reactive oxygen metabolites [14]. hence, the fact that
 xxxd2162xxx  attenuates il-8 production means the drug
possibly reduces neutrophil-mediated tissue injury associated with cpb.
complement is activated by both classic and alternative pathways during cpb [15]. complement activation
generates the anaphylatoxins  xxxg282xxx  and c5a and membrane attack complex  xxxg285xxx -9. each of these substances
has been implicated as an important cause of the inflammatory response [16].  xxxg285xxx -9, formed as a byproduct of
the pathway and released into the plasma, is relatively
stable and a good marker of activation of the terminal
complex pathway [17]. in previous studies, nafamostat
mesilate completely attenuated  xxxg694xxx  re-

lease but failed to inhibit overall complement activity as
judged by  xxxg285xxx -9 [18]. on the other hand, anti-factor d
monoclonal antibody 166-32 inhibited the alternative
complement cascade and reduced the production of  xxxg282xxx ,
 xxxg285xxx -9, il-8, and  xxxg694xxx  and  xxxg1206xxx  expression during secc [13]. in a baboon cpb model, antifactor d 166-32 reduced  xxxg282xxx ,  xxxg285xxx -9, and il-6 production
and  xxxg1206xxx  expression [19]. it has been suggested that
 xxxg694xxx  is an important mediator in complement-mediated acute lung injury [20]. in the present
study, we expected il-8 reduction by  xxxg694xxx 
inhibition, but the attenuation of  xxxg285xxx -9 in the  xxxd2162xxx 
group was not expected with certainty. our findings, as
well as the results of previous studies, suggest that
 xxxg694xxx  activity may have close interactions
with complement activation and inflammatory cytokines
inside the huge network of the inflammatory cascade.
downregulation of l-selectin and upregulation of
 xxxg1206xxx  during secc have been proven to be good
markers of neutrophil activation [5, 6, 10, 21, 22]. in
response to stimulation by chemotactic factors, there is a
rapid and transient increase in f-actin assembly from the
g-actin pool [23]. changes in the neutrophil cytoskeleton
with f-actin assembly at the cell periphery are thought to
be responsible for cell deformability [23]. the decrease of
deformability of neutrophils contributes to neutrophil
sequestration in organ capillaries, allowing close proximity and adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells.
because neutrophil sequestration in organ capillaries is
one of the initiating events in the development of the
inflammatory response and multiple organ injuries [24],
f-actin content and expression of adhesion molecules of
neutrophils are important indicators for the inflammatory response. we have previously reported that secc
causes an increase of f-actin and a loss of neutrophil
deformability estimated by whole-blood transit time
through simulated microcapillaries, as well as an increase of  xxxg1206xxx  and a decrease of l-selectin [6]. we have
also reported that phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor
 xxxd3142xxx  attenuates expression of  xxxg1206xxx  and f-actin and
preserves neutrophil deformability in secc [5].
in the present study, however,  xxxd2162xxx  did not
modulate expression of adhesion molecules, cytoplasmic
f-actin content, or the change of neutrophil deformability. regarding f-actin content, there were relatively large
standard errors with time in both groups as found in our
previous studies [5, 6], which makes interpretation of the
drug’s effect on this cytoplasmic marker uncertain. it is
unclear why  xxxd2162xxx  did not affect these adhesion
molecules or cell deformability markers, despite significant attenuation of the plasma inflammatory mediators,
 xxxg694xxx , il-8, and  xxxg285xxx -9 by the drug. the lack
of endothelial cells, which have many molecules and
function against neutrophil adhesion, could be the main
reason. this may be a limitation of the current study on
the nonendothelial secc model, which mimics pediatric
cpb systems with a small membrane oxygenator and
small-diameter tubing. in the modulation of adhesion
molecules and the cytoskeleton and the deformability of
neutrophils,  xxxg694xxx  inhibitors may poten-

tially have positive effects in the presence of endothelial
cells, as has been demonstrated in a recent study which
shows that  xxxg694xxx  enhances adhesion of
neutrophils to endothelial cells [25]. although significant
limitations exist, a similar normothermic secc system
has been continuously used for many years to screen
potential anticoagulants and protease inhibitors in a
number of previous studies [5, 18, 26]. the advantage of
the secc model is that this totally in vitro approach can
avoid loss of activated blood cells or markers from the
circuit, and also avoids new cells being recruited from the
bone marrow. it is a screen and is not intended to be a
substitute for animal studies, which are not easy because
most human antibodies to inflammatory markers do not
cross-react with nonprimate laboratory animals. further
investigation of  xxxd2162xxx  in an in vivo primate cpb
system would be necessary to reveal the entire effects of
this promising drug on the inflammatory network in the
presence of the endothelial system.
in conclusion, inhibition of  xxxg694xxx  with
 xxxd2162xxx  reduces il-8 production and formation of the
terminal complement complex during secc, but does
not modulate neutrophil adhesion molecules, f-actin
content, or neutrophil deformability.  xxxg694xxx 
inhibition with  xxxd2162xxx  is a feasible therapeutic strategy to prevent an exaggerated inflammatory response in
cpb.
