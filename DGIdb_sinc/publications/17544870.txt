background & aims: it is unclear whether weight loss
with the noradrenergic (norepinephrine) and serotonergic
(5-hydroxytryptamine) reuptake inhibitor, sibutramine, is
associated with altered stomach functions and whether genetics influence treatment response. methods: forty-eight
overweight and obese but otherwise healthy participants
were randomized to placebo or sibutramine (15 mg/day for
12 weeks). at baseline and posttreatment we measured the
following: gastric emptying for solids and liquids by scintigraphy, gastric volumes by single-photon emission computed tomography, maximum tolerated volume and 30minute postnutrient challenge symptoms, and selected
gastrointestinal hormones. all participants received structured behavior therapy for weight management. the influence of candidate gene polymorphisms involved in norepinephrine and 5-hydroxytryptamine or receptor function
( xxxg1791xxx , guanine nucleotide binding protein ␤ polypeptide 3, ␣2a adrenoreceptor,
and solute carrier family 6 [ xxxg2148xxx ,
serotonin] member 4 [homo sapiens] [ xxxg2150xxx ]) on weight
loss and gastric functions was evaluated. results: the
overall average weight loss posttreatment was 5.4 ⴞ 0.8
(sem) kg with sibutramine and 0.9 ⴞ 0.9 kg with placebo (p
< .001). the sibutramine group showed significant retardation in gastric emptying of solids (p ⴝ .03), reduced
maximum tolerated volume (p ⴝ .03), and increased postprandial  xxxd1348xxx  compared with the placebo group.
obese females showed greater effects of sibutramine on
weight loss and gastric emptying of solids and liquids.
gastric volumes and postchallenge symptoms were not significantly different in the 2 treatment groups. the ls/ss
genotype of the promoter for  xxxg2150xxx  was associated with
enhanced weight loss with sibutramine. conclusions:
weight reduction with sibutramine is associated with altered gastric functions and increased  xxxd1348xxx  and is
significantly associated with  xxxg2150xxx  genotype. the role of
genetic variation in  xxxg2150xxx  on weight loss in response to
sibutramine deserves further study.

obesity,1

iven the public health implications of
there is a
need to further elucidate the pathophysiology of obesity
and to develop effective therapies for weight loss. sibutramine,
a serotonergic and adrenergic reuptake inhibitor approved for
long-term treatment of obesity, acts by controlling energy intake and energy expenditure through serotonergic and adren-

ergic mechanisms in the hypothalamic nuclei that regulate
appetite.2 the average weight loss after 1 year of sibutramine is
typically about 5 kg3 and is enhanced when behavioral therapy
is added to the treatment program.4
serotonin inhibits food intake at a hypothalamic level5 and
increases energy expenditure through effects on hypothalamic
serotonergic neurons.6,7 the gastrointestinal tract controls energy intake through food consumption, digestion, and absorption of nutrients. the stomach signals satiation in response to
ingestion of calories or volume.8,9 stomach functions such as
sensation, emptying, and accommodation of a meal also are
influenced by serotonergic and adrenergic mechanisms.10,11
genetic variation influences weight loss in response to sibutramine.12,13 genetic variation in the conversion of norepinephrine to epinephrine ( xxxg1791xxx 
g-148a genetic variant) and function g proteins (guanine nucleotide binding protein ␤ polypeptide 3 [gn␤3] c825t) may
influence weight loss in response to sibutramine.12,13 several
candidate genes modulate serotonin reuptake and the function
of the ␣2 adrenoreceptors.14,15 genetic variation in the serotonin transporter also influences food impulsivity16 and glycemic
control.17 gene transfection studies with solute carrier family 6
( xxxg2148xxx , serotonin) member 4 (homo sapiens) ( xxxg2150xxx ; the gene for the serotonin transporter) promoter show that homozygous short and heterozygous genotype
are associated with impaired promoter function and synthesis
of the protein compared with the wild-type homozygous long
variant.18
the aims of this study were to compare gastric motor and
sensory functions and fasting and postprandial changes in
plasma  xxxg873xxx  (glp-1), leptin, insulin, and
 xxxd1348xxx  (pyy) levels in healthy overweight and obese individuals after randomized assignment to receiving either placebo
or sibutramine (15 mg/day) for 12 weeks and to assess the
influence of candidate norepinephrine and 5-hydroxytryptamine genes on the weight loss and gastric functions in response
to sibutramine.

methods
study design and participants
this randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled,
double-blind study evaluated the effect of sibutramine on gastric functions and weight loss in healthy overweight and obese
participants. the study was approved by the mayo clinic institutional review board. we evaluated 48 healthy men and
women between the ages of 18 and 65 years who were overweight (body mass index [bmi] ⫽ 25–29.9 kg/m2) or obese
(bmi ⬎ 30 kg/m2). they were recruited either by a contact letter
mailed to a database of individuals who previously had expressed interest in participating in a clinical trial for obesity or
by public advertisement.
the randomization schedule was provided by the study statistician to the research pharmacy, but all investigators and
patients were blinded. allocation to treatment was concealed.
participants were not eligible to participate if they had cardiac
(including hypertension), endocrine (other than hyperglycemia
not requiring medical therapy), or unstable psychiatric disease;
significant medical illness; or prior abdominal surgery (other
than appendectomy, cholecystectomy, caesarian section, or
tubal ligation). they were excluded if their weight exceeded 137
kg (limit of the single-photon emission computed tomography
camera) or if they used any medications that may alter gastrointestinal motility, appetite, or absorption (eg, orlistat [xenical,
roche pharmaceuticals, nutley, nj]).
participants completed the hospital anxiety and depression scale,19 a self-administered alcoholism screening test,20
and a questionnaire on eating and weight patterns21 to
exclude psychiatric morbidity, alcoholism, and binge eating
disorder and bulimia, respectively. permissible medications
were multivitamins, birth control pill, estrogen, and thyroxine replacement.
after signing a written informed consent form and undergoing a screening evaluation and a pregnancy test (when applicable), subjects presented to the mayo clinic general clinical
research center. for 3 days, after overnight fasting, participants underwent baseline tests of gastric motor and sensory
functions, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry measurement of
body composition, and blood samples. these tests were repeated after 12 weeks of treatment.

gastric volumes
we used a previously validated, noninvasive method to
measure gastric volume during fasting and 30 minutes after
300 ml of ensure ([316 kcal], ross laboratories, columbus,
oh) using single-photon emission computed tomography.22
after an intravenous injection of 99mtco4, which is taken up by
the gastric mucosa, tomographic images of the gastric wall were
obtained through the long axis of the stomach using a dualhead gamma camera (smv single-photon emission computed
tomography system, smv america, twinsburg, oh) that rotates around the body. by using image processing libraries
(avw 3.0 biomedical imaging; mayo foundation, rochester,
mn), 3-dimensional rendering of the stomach permitted its
volume (ml) to be calculated. there is high intraobserver reproducibility to measure gastric volume with this technique.23,24

clinical gastroenterology and hepatology vol. 5, no. 7

gastric emptying
gastric emptying of solids and liquids was measured
using dual-isotope, planar scintigraphy and a meal (total calories, 296 kcal; 32% protein, 35% fat, and 33% carbohydrate)
consisting of eggs labeled with 99mtc-sulfur colloid (0.75 mci)
during cooking, 1 slice of bread, and 240 ml of 1% milk labeled
with 111in-dtpa (0.05 mci). anterior and posterior gamma
camera images were obtained of the intragastric content immediately after meal ingestion, every 15 minutes for the first 2
hours, and then every 30 minutes for the next 2 hours. data
were analyzed as in previous studies25 to estimate gastric emptying.

satiation and postchallenge symptoms
a standardized nutrient drink (ensure: 1 kcal/ml, 11%
fat, 73% carbohydrate, and 16% protein) was used to measure
satiation as the maximum tolerated volume (mtv) after ingestion at a rate of 30 ml/min, and symptoms 30 minutes postchallenge.26,27

body composition
total body fat and lean mass were measured by dualenergy x-ray absorptiometry (lunar corporation, madison, wi)
at baseline and after treatment.28

fasting and 2-hour postprandial hormonal
responses
to measure levels of leptin, insulin, glp-1, and pyy
during the nutrient drink test, blood draws were obtained at
⫺15, 0 (beginning of nutrient drink test), 15, 30, 45, 60, and
120 minutes.

immunochemical assays of plasma
leptin level was measured by the human leptin doubleantibody radioimmunoassay kit (linco research, inc., st. louis,
mo). the separation of free and bound antigen is achieved by
using a double-antibody system.
total ghrelin level was measured by a radioimmunoassay
technique (linco research, inc.). the assay uses 125i-labeled
ghrelin and a ghrelin antiserum to determine the level of total
ghrelin in plasma.
insulin was measured by a 2-site, 1-step (sandwich) immunoenzymatic assay performed on the beckman unicel dxi
automated immunoassay system (beckman instruments,
chaska, mn).
glp-1 was measured as the biologically active glp-1 (7-36,
7-37) using a 2-site noncompetitive immunoassay based on
enzyme-labeled quantification of glp-1 detected by a fluorogenic substrate.
pyy was measured by radioimmunoassay (linco research,
inc.). pyy exists in at least 2 molecular forms, 1-36 and 3-36,
both of which are physiologically active.

candidate genes
all participants in the study (men and women, obese
and overweight, sibutramine and placebo-treated, except for 1
man who was randomized to sibutramine) underwent venous
blood sampling for analysis for the candidate genes. venous
blood drawn from a forearm vein was stored and submitted for
genetic analysis as de-identified samples. genomic dna was

performed on the autopure ls (gentra systems, minneapolis,

gn␤3 genotypes were determined by methods in the literature using real-time polymerase chain reaction based on taqman chemistries and taqman primer-probe assays for gn␤3
snp c825t (rs6489738) amplification and detection by fluorescence. the distribution of gn␤3 snp c825t genotypes in
152 healthy controls in our prior studies from the same community was cc 50.7%, tc 40.8%, and tt 8.6%.29
molecular assays to genotype the sert-p ( xxxg2150xxx ) promoter
and ␣2-1291c/g polymorphisms that respectively influence serotonergic and ␣2 adrenergic functions were performed as described earlier.14,30 ␣2-1291c/g also was analyzed by denaturing
high-performance liquid chromatography using the varian helix system (varian inc., palo alto, ca). the distribution of
 xxxg2150xxx  snp genotypes in 120 healthy controls in our prior
studies from the same community was ll 31%, ls 49%, and ss
20%.14 the genotype distribution for ␣2a-1291c/g was cc 57%,
cg 36%, and gg 7%.14
all  xxxg1791xxx  data analyzed for g148a single-nucleotide polymorphism, as well as random samples in which polymorphisms
were detected on the assays described earlier, were confirmed by
dye terminator sequencing performed at the mayo molecular
biology core facility using an abi 3730xl sequencer (perkinelmer applied biosystems, foster city, ca). primers are available on request.
in caucasians, the reported distributions of gg, ga, and aa
 xxxg1791xxx  genotypes (g148a) are 39%, 36%, and 25%, respectively.12
after the genotypes were analyzed, results were submitted to
the study coordinator (d.a.i.) to re-associate with the patient
identifiers and subsequent analysis with the rest of the data by
the study statistician (a.r.z.).

treatment and follow-up evaluation
after completion of baseline studies, participants were
randomized (stratified by sex and bmi group) to receive either
placebo or sibutramine, 15 mg/day, for 12 weeks. all participants were provided with the learn manual,31 a commercially
available self-help behavioral manual for weight loss. they also
received brief, structured, behavior therapy sessions (10 –15
min) delivered by trained master’s- or doctoral-level behavioral
therapists (m.m.c., s.a.k., k.m.g.) every 4 weeks. to enhance
consistency of the behavioral visits, each session had 3 content
areas to review, participants were encouraged to read corresponding sessions in the learn manual, and the interventionists met monthly to ensure adherence to the study protocol.
during these study visits, vital signs, compliance, and side
effects were evaluated. during the last 3 days of treatment,
participants underwent the same studies as performed at baseline.

statistical analysis
for the primary end points (weight, gastric emptying),
the changes (postdrug ⫺ predrug value) were analyzed using an
analysis of covariance with sex and bmi group (overweight vs
obese) as covariates.
a similar approach was used to assess treatment effects on
gastric volumes, satiation (mtv and aggregate symptom score),
and the fasting and hormone responses to the meal (ie, mean
postmeal value ⫺ average fasting in each subject) using sex,
bmi group, and the corresponding predrug value as covariates.
thus, for example, we compared the effects of treatment (data
appear in tables 1 and 2 in posttreatment columns) on the
change in pyy level after the meal (ie, mean postprandial ⫺
fasting) using as a covariate the corresponding change mea-

columns).
for all end points, in addition to the main effects of sex, bmi
group, and treatment group, three 2-way interaction terms and
a single 3-way interaction term were included in these models.
to examine the potential influence of candidate genes on
treatment effects, separate analysis of covariance models were
used for each of the end points noted earlier for each single
candidate gene (included in the model as a categoric predictor
with 2 specific genotypes, eg, ll vs ls/ss for  xxxg2150xxx ). sex,
actual bmi value, and, for some responses, the corresponding
predrug value were included as covariates, and a gene category
by treatment interaction term was included in the model.
to enable intent-to-treat analyses, the few missing (postdrug) response values were imputed using the corresponding
overall (subjects with nonmissing data) mean value for that
response. the error degrees of freedom in the respective analysis
of covariance models were reduced by 1 for each missing value
imputed.

there was a significant correlation between postnutrient
change in leptin and weight loss (spearman r [rs] ⫽ 0.47; p ⫽
.002) and between postprandial change in ghrelin and weight
loss (rs ⫽ ⫺0.39; p ⫽ .010). other possible associations with
degree of weight loss were observed for change in baseline leptin
(rs ⫽ 0.39; p ⫽ .009), baseline ghrelin (rs ⫽ ⫺0.37; p ⫽ .014),
and the total calories ingested at the ad libitum meal (rs ⫽ 0.38;
p ⫽ .011). there were no significant associations of the change
in weight with the change in gastric emptying of solids or
liquids, the change in mtv, or the change in the average
postprandial pyy, glp-1, or insulin levels, nor with the baseline
changes in pyy, glp-1, and insulin levels.

influence of candidate genes on weight loss
and gastric functions
the  xxxg2150xxx  ls/ss genotype had a significant influence
on the effect of treatment for the change in weight (p ⫽ .024).
subjects with  xxxg2150xxx  ls/ss genotype on sibutramine had an
average weight loss of 6.1 ⫾ 1.0 kg compared with a 0.1 ⫾ 0.9
kg average weight increase on placebo; in contrast, for subjects
with the homozygous long ( xxxg2150xxx  ll) genotype, changes in
weight were similar in both treatment groups, with an average
weight loss of 3.3 ⫾ 1.8 kg in placebo compared with a 3.9 ⫾
1.6 kg weight loss in the sibutramine group. no effects on
weight response to treatment were found with the ␣2a-1291
c/g,  xxxg1791xxx , and gn␤3 genotypes. none of the candidate genes
significantly influenced the gastric functions evaluated.

discussion

figure 2. gastric emptying of solids and liquids in obese or overweight
individuals treated with placebo or sibutramine.

the effects of treatment on postnutrient values of leptin or
glp-1 also were not significant. review of the data for postprandial delta pyy shows that, for both the overweight and
obese groups, there was a higher delta pyy with sibutramine
during posttreatment compared with pretreatment with sibutramine, whereas the delta pyy with placebo was lower posttreatment compared with pretreatment. the converse applies
for postprandial delta insulin levels, which were lower postsibutramine compared with presibutramine, particularly in the
overweight group, and were essentially unchanged with placebo. the statistical analysis shows that, postnutrient challenge,
the pyy levels were higher (p ⫽ .035) and insulin levels were
lower (p ⫽ .009) in the sibutramine group compared with
placebo. there was no significant effect of treatment by bmi
group or by sex on the pyy or insulin levels.
the analysis of covariance indicated treatment effects on the
fasting ghrelin levels (p ⫽ .038) and no interactions of treatment with sex or bmi group. no treatment effects were detected for the postprandial change in ghrelin response (p ⫽
.15), nor any treatment interactions with sex or bmi group.

in this study, overweight and obese subjects treated
with sibutramine had an expected significant weight reduction
(average, 5.4 ⫾ 0.8 kg). we found that sibutramine caused a
significant delay in gastric emptying of solids relative to placebo
treatment, with a greater effect being shown in obese women, in
whom there was also a delay in gastric emptying of liquids.
there was also a significant effect of sibutramine on the maximum volume that could be ingested compared with placebo.
this reduction in the volume of meal tolerated in response to
sibutramine treatment also was significant among obese female
participants. we also found that individuals with the  xxxg2150xxx 
ls/ss genotype had greater weight loss with sibutramine treatment.
the observed effects of sibutramine on gastric emptying
have not been reported previously. there are only 2 animal
studies in the literature on the effects of sibutramine on gastrointestinal function. in a recent study, xu and chen32 showed
that sibutramine, 5 mg/kg, increased fasting tone and decreased
postprandial accommodation in the proximal stomach in a
study of 7 dogs. in another study by kim et al,33 sibutramine
mesylate decreased gastric volume and total acidity when administered to beagle dogs at doses of 3.45 and 11.50 mg/kg.
these dose levels are far higher than the total doses (10 and 15
mg) approved for use in human beings in the treatment of
obesity. our study in human beings provides observation of the
effect of sibutramine (15 mg/day) on gastric emptying, documents the effect on the volume of food tolerated in a satiation
test, but does not confirm the negative effects on gastric accommodation observed in dogs at dose levels at least 20-fold
higher than those permissible in human beings.
the observations in our study are consistent with the observations that early satiation and weight loss are associated with

figure 3. change in body weight in overweight and obese males and females treated with placebo and sibutramine (a). note the overall significant
effects of sibutramine on weight loss are most clearly demonstrable in obese females. changes in gastric emptying of solids (b) and liquids (c) in

functional dyspepsia26 and that gastric emptying delay is one of
the factors that has been proven to be associated with postprandial symptoms such as satiation and bloating in dyspepsia
and in obese individuals.34,35 an alternative hypothesis is that
greater weight loss may cause the earlier satiation. however,
based on the regression parameters from a prior study,27 one
could account for an average reduction of postprandial gastric
volume of 12 ml and of mtv of less than 30 ml based on the
approximate 2 kg/m2 reduction in bmi with sibutramine. because sibutramine treatment was associated with a mean reduction in mtv of at least 150 ml, weight loss per se cannot
explain the change in satiation.
as expected, fasting levels of leptin decreased with weight loss.36
we also observed an increased response of pyy to a challenge
liquid meal with sibutramine. this would appear to be counterintuitive given the delay in gastric emptying of nutrients and the
release of pyy from ileal mucosa. however, it is well known that ␣and ␤-adrenergic mechanisms regulate pyy secretion37– 40; therefore, we believe that the increase in pyy postprandially reflects the
direct effect of the sibutramine on the release of pyy. batterham et

al41 suggested that exogenous pyy3–36 is associated with reduced
nutrient intake. it is conceivable that the increased pyy released in
response to sibutramine may in part mediate the effect of sibutramine on gastric emptying and weight loss, given the known effects
of pyy as part of the ileal brake mechanism,42 retarding gastric
emptying and reducing upper-gastrointestinal motility. although
the present studies do not allow determination of whether the
effect of sibutramine on gastric emptying is direct through the
action on serotonergic or adrenergic mechanisms or indirect
through the release of pyy, the data suggest that the role of these
different mechanisms and their contribution to weight loss deserve further study.
we observed lower postnutrient plasma insulin concentrations with sibutramine treatment. this may reflect the greater
weight loss and expected coincident improvement in insulin
action, the delayed gastric emptying of solid and liquid nutrient, or, conceivably, a direct inhibition of insulin secretion by
the sibutramine. in view of the evidence that norepinephrine
inhibits insulin release by isolated pancreatic islet cells,43 the
latter possibility cannot be excluded.

a third observation is that subjects with  xxxg2150xxx  ls/ss
genotypes had a greater weight loss with sibutramine compared
with placebo. this may suggest that people with partial functioning of the serotonin transporter have an increased availability of serotonin for receptor-ligand interaction, leading to a
more effective action of sibutramine, which also functions to
prevent the re-uptake of serotonin. it is intriguing that overall
weight loss with placebo was 0.9 ⫾ 0.9 kg, whereas patients
with ll  xxxg2150xxx  genotype on placebo lost 3.3 ⫾ 1.8 kg. this
may suggest the hypothesis that the ll  xxxg2150xxx  genotype may
enhance the response to placebo. there was some evidence that
the tt/tc genotype of gn␤3 was associated with greater
weight loss in response to placebo in a prior study comparing
weight loss in response to sibutramine vs placebo.44 the mechanism whereby such genetic variation in  xxxg2150xxx  leads to a
greater response to placebo is unclear and requires further
study.
we were unable to confirm the reports in the literature on
the association of weight loss with the genotype polymorphisms of the phenylethanolamine n-methyltransferase12 and
gn␤3.13 further studies are required to evaluate the role of
pharmacogenetics in sibutramine therapy and to determine
whether the genetic influence on the weight response is mediated through a change in gastric function.
in summary, our data suggest that the stomach may play an
important role in the induction of satiation and reduced calorie
intake in patients receiving sibutramine for weight loss. however, we regard these results as exploratory, and further studies
are required to confirm the effects of sibutramine on gastric
emptying and satiation. moreover, the role of genetic variation
on weight loss in response to sibutramine deserves further
study; however, it appears that genetic modulation of endogenous serotonin may be a factor that may explain, at least in
part, the wide variation in the weight loss observed in clinical
trials with this medication. understanding such genetic variation may facilitate the selection of candidates or individualizing
the dose of medication to achieve the desired effect.
