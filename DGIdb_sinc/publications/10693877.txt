comparison of the effect of rofecoxib (a  xxxg1884xxx  inhibitor), ibuprofen, and placebo on the gastroduodenal mucosa of patients with osteoart...  this randomized, double-blind study tested the hypothesis that rofecoxib, a drug that specifically inhibits  xxxg1884xxx , would cause fewer gastroduodenal ulcers than ibuprofen (in a multicenter trial), and its side effects would be equivalent to those of placebo (in a prespecified analysis combining the results with another trial of identical design).
