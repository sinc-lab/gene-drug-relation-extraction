abstract
the present study was conducted to characterize the binding of neurotransmitter receptors (dopamine d2, serotonin 5-ht2, histamine h1,
adrenaline  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  and muscarine ml receptors) in the rat's brain after the oral administration of haloperidol, risperidone, and olanzapine. haloperidol at
1 and 3 mg/kg displayed significant activity to bind the  xxxg656xxx  (increase in the kd value for [3h]raclopride binding) in the corpus striatum
with little change in the activity toward the  xxxg1113xxx  (binding parameters for [3h] xxxd2419xxx ). in contrast, risperidone (0.1–3 mg/kg) showed
roughly 30 times more affinity for the  xxxg1113xxx  than  xxxg656xxx . also, olanzapine (1–10 mg/kg) was most active toward the  xxxg1078xxx  in
the cerebral cortex, corpus striatum, and hippocampus, was less active in binding 5-ht2 and d2 receptors, and showed the least affinity for  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  and
m1 receptors. in conclusion, haloperidol and risperidone administered orally selectively bind d2 and 5-ht2 receptors, respectively, in the rat brain,
while olanzapine binds h1, 5-ht2, and d2 receptors more than  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  and m1 receptors.

introduction
it is widely accepted that typical antipsychotic drugs such as
haloperidol reduce the symptoms of schizophrenia by blocking
central  xxxg656xxx . although most typical antipsychotic agents improve symptoms such as paranoia and
hallucinations, they have little effect on negative symptoms
(social withdrawal, blunting affect and poverty of speech) and
cognitive deficits (kelleher et al., 2002). furthermore, the
blockade of central dopamine receptors also leads to the
development of extrapyramidal side effects (eps) (tarsy et al.,
2002). currently, atypical antipsychotic drugs, risperidone and
olanzapine, have been shown to ameliorate not only positive but
also negative symptoms of schizophrenia without producing
eps (tran et al., 1997).

in previous receptor-binding experiments in vitro, olanzapine
displayed high affinity for serotonin-5-ht2, histamine-h1,
dopamine-d1, and dopamine-d2 receptors (fulton and goa,
1997). risperidone also showed affinity for various neurotransmitter receptors (leysen et al., 1988) and there is some clinical
evidence that the 5-ht2 antagonistic properties of these atypical
antipsychotics may improve efficacy and reduce eps (tarsy et al.,
2002). however, the data obtained from experiments in vitro do
not necessarily assure pharmacological specificity such as
potency and duration of action in vivo because they do not take
both pharmacokinetic (absorption and disposition) and pharmacodynamic factors into account (yamada et al., 2001).thus, the
determination of the degree of occupancy of various neurotransmitter receptors by antipsychotics under in vivo conditions seems
to be important in order to characterize pharmacological
specificity in relation to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, as reported for 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel
antagonists (yamada et al., 2002),  xxxg99xxx  receptor
antagonists (nozawa et al., 1998),  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  adrenoceptor antagonists

(yamada et al., 2001),  xxxg1634xxx  antagonists (yamada
et al., 2003), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (hirano et al.,
2005) and muscarinic receptor antagonists (oki et al., 2005,
2006). to date, several investigators have conducted experiments
ex vivo and in vivo on the binding of brain neurotransmitter
receptors by antipsychotic drugs (stockmeier et al., 1993; schotte
et al., 1993; sumiyoshi et al., 1995), but these studies involved
subcutaneous or intraperitoneal administration which is different
from the clinical route used for these drugs. such a difference may
influence pharmacokinetics such as distribution, metabolism,
excretion and concentration in the brain. for example, risperidone
is efficiently extracted by the liver (first-pass effect) resulting in
relatively low availability (meuldermans et al., 1994). thus, the
present study was conducted to characterize the binding to various
brain neurotransmitter receptors in rats after the oral administration of haloperidol, risperidone, and olanzapine.
materials and methods
materials
[ 3 h]raclopride (3200 gbq/mmo1), [ 3 h] xxxd2419xxx 
(2456.8 gbq/mmol), [ xxxd3050xxx  (858.4 gbq/mmol), [3h]
 xxxd3000xxx  (3000 gbq/mmo1) and [3h] xxxd2965xxx  (2900 gbq/
mmo1) were purchased from dupont-nen co. ltd. (boston,
ma). risperidone and olanzapine were kindly donated by eli
lilly co. (indianapolis, in) and janssen research foundation
(beerse, belgium), respectively. all other drugs and materials
were obtained from commercial sources.
animals
male sprague–dawley rats  xxxd2274xxx  to 8 weeks of age (japan
slc inc., shizuoka, japan) were housed in the laboratory with
free access to food and water, and were maintained on a l2 h
dark/light cycle in a room with controlled temperature (24 ±
1 °c) and humidity (55 ± 5%). this study was conducted
according to guidelines approved by the experimental animal
ethical committee of university of shizuoka.
tissue preparation and neurotransmitter receptor-binding assay
rats were fasted for 16 h and then orally administered with
haloperido1 (0.3–3 mg/kg), risperidone (0.1–3 mg/kg), or
olanzapine (1–10 mg/kg) dissolved in acetic acid (0.2%). at 1 h
after the administration, rats were killed by taking the blood
from the descending aorta under light anesthesia with diethyl
ether, and the brain was perfused with 0.9% nacl from the
aorta. then, the entire brain was removed, and divided into the
cerebral cortex, corpus striatum, and hippocampus. each region
was homogenized in 50 mm tris–hcl buffer (ph 7.5)
containing 120 mm nacl and 5 mm kcl with a polytron
homogenizer, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 40,000 ×g
for 15 min. the pellet was resuspended in ice-cold buffer, and
the suspension was centrifuged again at 40,000 ×g for 15 min.
the resulting pellet was suspended once again in the buffer for
the binding assay. all steps were performed at 4 °c.

the binding assay for dopamine-d2 receptors, serotonin-5ht2 receptors, histamine-h1 receptors, xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  adrenoceptors and
muscarine-m1 receptors in brain homogenates was performed
by using [3 h]raclopride, [3 h] xxxd2419xxx , [ 3 h] xxxd3050xxx , [3 h]
 xxxd3000xxx  and [ 3 h] xxxd2965xxx , respectively, as previously
described (kohler et al., 1985; leysen et al., 1982; chang
et al., 1978; yamada et al., 1987; richards, 1990). briefly, the
brain homogenates were incubated with various concentrations of [ 3 h]raclopride (0.4–4 nm) for 1 h at 25 °c in 50 mm
tris–hcl buffer (ph 7.5), [3 h] xxxd2419xxx  (0.1–2 nm) for
15 min at 37 °c in 50 mm tris–hcl buffer (ph 7.5), [3 h]
 xxxd3050xxx  (1–8 nm) for 1 h at 25 °c in 50 mm na/k
phosphate buffer (ph 7.4), [ 3 h] xxxd3000xxx  (0.05–0.5 nm) for
30 min at 25 °c in 50 mm na/k phosphate buffer (ph 7.5) and
[3 h] xxxd2965xxx  (1.0–10 nm) for 1.5 h at 25 °c in 50mm na/k
phosphate buffer (ph 7.4). the reaction was terminated by
rapid filtration (cell harvester, brandel co., gaithersburg,
md) through whatman gf/b glass fiber filters, and the filters
were rinsed three times with 2 ml of ice-cold buffer. tissuebound radioactivity was extracted from filters overnight in
scintillation fluid (2 l toluene, 1 l of tritonx-10, 15 g of 2,5diphenyloxazole, and 0.3 g of 1,4-bis[2-(5-phenyloxazolyl)]
benzene) and determined by a liquid scintillation counter. the
specific binding of each radioligand was experimentally
determined from the difference between counts in the absence
and presence of the following drugs: 3 mum (+)-butaclamol in
the [ 3 h]raclopride assay, 3 mum  xxxd2621xxx  in the [3 h]
 xxxd2419xxx  assay, 3 mum  xxxd236xxx  in the [3 h] xxxd3050xxx  assay,
10 mum  xxxd2914xxx  in the [3h] xxxd3000xxx  assay, and 1 mum
atropine in the [3 h] xxxd2965xxx  assay. these displacers at
nanomolar concentration ranges inhibited specific binding of
each radioligand in the concentration dependent manner. all
assays were conducted in duplicate. every binding experiment
was performed using fresh tissue. the protein concentration
was measured according to the method of lowry et al. (1951)
using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a standard.
data analysis
the binding data was analyzed as described previously
(yamada et al., 1980). the apparent dissociation constant (kd)
and maximal number of binding sites (bmax) for each
radioligand were estimated by rosenthal analysis of the
saturation data (rosenthal, 1967). the in vitro ability of

in the rat brain were examined and in vitro ki values are
summarized in table 1. haloperidol displayed its highest
affinity for [3h]raclopride-binding sites, moderate affinity for
binding sites of [3h] xxxd3000xxx  and [3h] xxxd2419xxx , and extremely
low affinity for binding sites of [ xxxd3050xxx  and [3h]
 xxxd2965xxx . on the other hand, the affinity of risperidone was
as follows: [ 3 h] xxxd2419xxx  n [ 3 h] xxxd3000xxx  n [ 3 h]raclopride n
[ xxxd3050xxx , and that of olanzapine was [3h] xxxd2419xxx ,
[ xxxd3050xxx  n [3 h] xxxd2965xxx  n [3h]racloprine n [3h] xxxd3000xxx . the ki values for the inhibition of each radioligand by
haloperidol, risperidone, and olanzapine were reasonably
consistent with values reported previously (fulton and goa,
1997; leysen et al., 1988; moore et al., 1993).
receptor-binding characteristics after oral administration
table 2 shows the kd and bmax for the specific binding of
[3h]raclopride to the rat corpus striatum 1 h after the oral
administration of haloperidol, risperidone, and olanzapine. each
drug increased the kd in a dose-dependent manner, with a
significant increase observed after the oral administration of
haloperidol (1, 3 mg/kg), risperidone (3 mg/kg), and olanzapine
(3, 10 mg/kg) compared to the control values. as shown in
table 3, there were significant changes in the kd and bmax for the
specific binding of [3h] xxxd2419xxx  in the cerebral cortex, corpus
striatum, and hippocampus of rats 1 h after the oral administration
of risperidone (0.1–3 mg/kg) and olanzapine (3, 10 mg/kg).
notably, relatively low doses (0.1–3 mg/kg) of risperidone
produced a significant increase in the kd and significant decrease
in the bmax for the binding of [3h] xxxd2419xxx  in each region of the
brain. the decrease in the bmax was more remarkable than the
increase in the kd in all regions after the administration of
risperidone. the kd increased 42–78% in the cerebral cortex,
107–116% in the corpus striatum, and 67% in the hippocampus.
the bmax decreased 22–58%, 30–56%, and 36–56%, respectively. furthermore, the change in binding parameters was greater
in the cerebral cortex than in the corpus striatum or hippocampus.
the oral administration of haloperidol (1, 3 mg/kg) had no effect

on the kd and bmax of [3h] xxxd2419xxx  binding in the rat cerebral
cortex (data not shown).
the oral administration of olanzapine (3, 10 mg/kg)
produced significant and dose-related increases in the kd for
the specific binding of [3h] xxxd2419xxx  in each region of the
brain without a change in the bmax (table 3). the kd increased
63–184% at 3 mg/kg and 204–303%  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg in the cerebral
cortex, corpus striatum, and hippocampus. furthermore, the
effects of the oral administration of olanzapine on the binding of
[ xxxd3050xxx , [3h] xxxd3000xxx , and [3h] xxxd2965xxx  in the rat
brain were examined. as shown in table 4, olanzapine at doses
of 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg brought about a significant increase in the
kd and/or decrease in the bmax for the specific binding of [3h]
 xxxd3050xxx  in each region and the magnitude did not appear to
differ among regions. on the other hand, only the highest dose
of olanzapine (10 mg/kg) increased significantly the kd for the
specific binding of [3h] xxxd3000xxx  and [3h] xxxd2965xxx  in the rat
cerebral cortex and/or hippocampus.
discussion
the current study was undertaken to evaluate comparatively
the binding of neurotransmitter receptors in the rat brain after
the oral administration of haloperidol, risperidone, and
olanzapine. the affinity of each antipsychotic drug for the
receptors was examined based on inhibitory effects on the
specific binding of [ 3 h]raclopride (dopamine d2), [ 3 h]
 xxxd2419xxx  (serotonin 5-ht2), [ xxxd3050xxx  (histamine h1),
[3h] xxxd3000xxx  (adrenaline  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx ) and [3h] xxxd2965xxx  (muscarine
m1) in the rat brain. haloperidol displayed the highest affinity
for the  xxxg656xxx  among five receptors. risperidone showed a
higher affinity for 5-ht2 (5 times) and  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  (2 times) receptors
than  xxxg656xxx . similarly, olanzapine displayed 2–6 times

greater affinity for 5-ht2 and h1 receptors than d2,  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  and m1
receptors. thus, risperidone and olanzapine showed a broad
spectrum of brain neurotransmitter receptors as previously
reported (leysen et al., 1988; fulton and goa, 1997). notably,
olanzapine compared with risperidone displayed relatively high
affinity for h1 and m1 receptors and lower affinity for the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx 
receptor.
to date, there have been several reports about ex vivo and in
vivo brain neurotransmitter receptor-binding characteristics of
antipsychotics (stockmeier et al., 1993; schotte et al., 1993;
sumiyoshi et al., 1995), but most of these studies involved
routes of administration different from those in the clinical use
of these drugs. thus, we have characterized brain neurotransmitter receptor binding in rats after the oral administration of
haloperidol, risperidone, and olanzapine. the doses used of
haloperidol (0.3–3 mg/kg), risperidone (0.1–3 mg/kg), and
olanzapine (1–10 mg/kg) have been shown to attenuate
significantly conditioned avoidance response (a behavioral
model used to predict the effects of antipsychotic drugs in the
treatment of schizophrenia) in rats, indicating that they are
pharmacologically relevant (moore et al., 1992).
oral administration of haloperidol (1, 3 mg/kg) increased
significantly and dose-dependently the kd for the specific
binding of [3h]raclopride in the rat corpus striatum with little
effect on the binding of [3h] xxxd2419xxx  in the cerebral cortex.
given that an increase in kd for the radioligands in drugpretreated tissues in the radioreceptor assay generally reflects
competition between the agent and radioligand for the same
binding sites (yamada et al., 2003), these results strongly
suggest that orally administered haloperidol undergoes significant binding to brain  xxxg656xxx .
following the oral administration of risperidone at a high dose
(3 mg/kg), there was a significant increase in the kd for the

s. uchida et al. / life sciences 80 (2007) 1635–1640

specific binding of [3h]raclopride in the rat corpus striatum
compared to the control values. on the other hand, lower doses
(0.1–1 mg/kg) of risperidone produced significant changes
(increase in the kd and/or decrease in the bmax) in the parameters
for the binding of [3h] xxxd2419xxx  in the cerebral cortex, corpus
striatum, and hippocampus. these findings suggest that risperidone binds to  xxxg1113xxx  with roughly 30 times greater
affinity than  xxxg656xxx  after its oral administration. notably, the
selectivity of risperidone for  xxxg1113xxx  over  xxxg656xxx  was
6 times larger than that estimated based on experiments in vitro
(table 1). such a discrepancy is generally considered to stem from
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors. also, it is
conceivable that the receptor-binding properties of drugs in
brain neuronal cells under in vivo conditions differ significantly
from those in membrane fractions. considering the pharmacological data showing that the oral administration of risperidone
inhibits conditioned avoidance response in rats with ed50 values
of 0.9–1.6 mg/kg (moore et al., 1992; seeger et al., 1995), our
data clearly support that the suppressive effect of risperidone on
this behavior might be mediated through the preferential blockade
of brain  xxxg1113xxx .
the effects of olanzapine on d2 , 5-ht2 , h1,  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  and m1
receptors were examined, because this drug exhibited considerable affinity for each receptor in vitro (table 1). oral
administration of olanzapine at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg
brought about a significant increase in kd values for the specific
binding of [3h]raclopride and [3h] xxxd2419xxx  in the brain
(tables 2, 3). interestingly, lower doses (1–10 mg/kg) of this
drug produced a significant increase in kd values and/or
decrease in bmax values for the binding of [ xxxd3050xxx  in
the rat cerebral cortex, corpus striatum and hippocampus
(table 4). only the highest dose (10 mg/kg) of olanzapine
produced a significant increase in the kd for [3h] xxxd3000xxx  and
[3h] xxxd2965xxx  in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. thus,
it is considered that in terms of susceptibility to binding by
olanzapine, the receptors in the brain ranked in the following
order:  xxxg1078xxx  n  xxxg1113xxx  =  xxxg656xxx  n  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  receptor,
 xxxg447xxx . thus, oral olanzapine, unlike in vitro, exhibited 3
times higher affinity for  xxxg1078xxx  than  xxxg1113xxx  in the
rat brain. the affinity of olanzapine for  xxxg1078xxx  was also
demonstrated in the human brain (richelson and souder, 2000).
rosenthal analysis revealed that the oral administration of
risperidone and olanzapine caused significant decreases in bmax
values for the binding of [3h] xxxd2419xxx  and [ xxxd3050xxx ,
respectively, in the rat brain. this observation may indicate that
risperidone and olanzapine bind 5-ht2 and h1 receptors in the
brain, respectively. in experiment in vitro and ex vivo, drugs that
dissociated slowly from receptors were characterized by a
decrease in bmax values for the binding of radioligands (yamada
et al., 1985; zernig et al., 1996; ohkura et al., 1998). therefore,
the marked decrease in the bmax values of risperidone and
olanzapine for the binding of [3h] xxxd2419xxx  and [ xxxd3050xxx 
may relate to their receptor-binding kinetics such as a slowly
dissociating blockade of 5-ht2 and h1 receptors.
it was reported that the effects of atypical antipsychotics used
to alleviate the negative symptoms of schizophrenia might be
involved in the modification of serotonergic neurotransmission

1639

(tarsy et al., 2002) and that the  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist
ritanserin is clinically effective in the treatment of negative
symptoms (duinkerke et al., 1993). in addition, the ratio of
antagonistic activity toward  xxxg1113xxx  versus  xxxg656xxx  is
important in reducing negative symptoms, and this ratio for
risperidone and olanzapine differs from that for haloperidol
(matsubara et al., 1993). furthermore, it is reported that
antagonism of the  xxxg1113xxx  enhances dopaminergic
neurotransmission, and this enhancement makes it possible to
alleviate the  xxxg656xxx  blocking effect of antipsychotics
(ichikawa and meltzer, 1999). taken together, the results of the
current study support the notion that  xxxg1113xxx  antagonism
in addition to  xxxg656xxx  antagonism would improve the efficacy
of risperidone and olanzapine administered orally in the treatment
of both positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenic patients
with little induction of eps, compared with haloperidol.
the anticholinergic action of atypical antipsychotics may
counteract the antidopaminergic action such as high in vivo
occupation and up-regulation of the  xxxg656xxx  (tarsy et al.,
2002), suggesting that the observed occupation of the m1
receptor by olanzapine might also contribute to the reduction in
the risk of eps. there is enough evidence of the interaction of
typical and atypical antipsychotics with cultured cells and brain
tissues to clarify the occupation by drugs of specific receptors.
however, the mechanisms of action of antipsychotic agents
used to treat various neurological disorders are not well
understood, and both antidopaminergic and antiserotonergic
effects are insufficient to account for the clinical properties of
atypical antipsychotics (tarsy et al., 2002; bymaster and felder,
2002; terry et al., 2003). in this regard, highest binding activity
of h1 receptors in the rat brain observed after the oral
administration of olanzapine might be a significant factor in
the pharmacological effects of this agent.
in conclusion, the current study has revealed that when
administered orally, haloperidol and risperidone selectively
bind d2 and 5-ht2 receptors, respectively, in the rat brain, while
olanzapine binds h1 and 5-ht2 and d2 receptors more
selectively than  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  and m1 receptors. thus, the characterization
of brain neurotransmitter receptor occupancy after the administration of antipsychotics via the routes used clinically may
offer pharmacologically relevant information on these drugs.
