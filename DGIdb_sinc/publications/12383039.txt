abstract

objective:  xxxd2149xxx  is the first in a new class of synthetic  xxxg741xxx 
inhibitors that binds reversibly with high affinity to  xxxg2056xxx . it has been
investigated for the prevention and treatment of arterial and venous thrombotic
disorders and approved for use at a dose of 2.5mg once daily in the prevention of
venous thromboembolism in major orthopaedic surgery. the pharmacokinetics of
 xxxd2149xxx  were determined in eight studies in young and elderly
healthy volunteers.
results: after a 2.5mg subcutaneous dose to young volunteers, absolute bioavailability was 100% and absorption was rapid and complete [peak plasma concentration (cmax) 0.34 mg/l occurred at approximately 2 hours]. within- and
total-subject variability estimates were small: 5.5 and 11.6%, respectively, for cmax
and 4.4 and 17.5% for area under the concentration-time curve (auc). steady
state was obtained after the third or fourth once-daily dose, with a 1.3-fold increase in cmax and auc. distribution volume (7 to 11l) was limited to blood
volume. there was no evidence of metabolism.  xxxd2149xxx  was almost
completely excreted in urine as unchanged compound (64 to 77% of the dose was
recovered at 72 hours after administration). plasma clearance was 5.1 to 7.9
ml/min, renal clearance 4.0 to 7.9 ml/min, and the terminal half-life was 17 hours
in young volunteers and 21 hours in elderly volunteers. pharmacokinetics of
 xxxd2149xxx  were linear in the range 2 to 8mg subcutaneously and 2 to
20mg intravenously. pharmacokinetics observed in healthy elderly volunteers
were consistent with findings in young male volunteers.
conclusion: the favourable pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd2149xxx  is
likely to play an important role in the major advance that the drug represents in
the prevention and treatment of thrombotic disorders.

introduction
the choice of antithrombotic therapy in venous
thrombotic disorders is currently made from three
classes of agent: unfractionated heparin (ufh),
low-molecular-weight heparins (lmwhs) and

oral anticoagulants. although effective in the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolic
disorders, these agents have multiple effects on
coagulation mechanisms which can lead to unpredictable anticoagulant effects.[1-4] the heparins
and oral anticoagulants are also associated with

2

unwanted and often serious adverse effects.[1-4]
monitoring of coagulation parameters is mandated
during treatment with ufh and oral anticoagulants.[4] the management of thromboembolic disorders is therefore beset by difficulties in achieving
the optimum balance between efficacy and safety.
the search for more selective antithrombotic
agents led to the development of the direct thrombin inhibitors, which selectively bind to and inhibit
factor iia. however, the consequences of inhibition of factor iia are controversial in terms of the
clinical efficacy-safety ratio, and clinical experience with direct thrombin inhibitors has shown that
the utility of these agents is limited to few clinical
settings.[5,6]
inhibition of  xxxg741xxx  has been an alternative
approach.  xxxg741xxx  is situated at the convergence
of the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of the coagulation cascade and is thus a key target for prophylactic anticoagulation.  xxxd2149xxx  is the
first in a new class of selective  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors.[7] this entirely synthetic molecule binds reversibly and with high affinity to the natural factor
xa inhibitor  xxxg2056xxx  ( xxxg2056xxx ), thus catalysing  xxxg2056xxx -mediated inactivation of  xxxg741xxx .[8,9]
 xxxd2149xxx  is a single chemical entity
that does not exist in nature, in contrast to the heparins, which are a heterogeneous group of molecules extracted from animal sources. thus,  xxxd2149xxx  has the potential for a highly
specific and selective mode of action that could
obviate the unpredictability and adverse effects
currently associated with the heparins and oral
anticoagulants.
 xxxd2149xxx  has been shown to have
potent antithrombotic activity in a variety of preclinical studies. it has been approved in the us and
in europe for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in major orthopaedic surgery. it is not
yet approved for use in patients with confirmed
venous thromboembolism but has been investigated in this indication.  xxxd2149xxx  has
also been investigated in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes. this article describes the phar© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

macokinetic profile of  xxxd2149xxx  in
healthy volunteers.
methods
eight pharmacokinetic studies took place in
france, the uk and the netherlands between 1995
and 2000. the studies were conducted in accordance with european community rules of good
clinical practice and the declaration of helsinki,
and were approved by the centres’ ethics committees. all subjects provided written informed consent.
study populations

more than 160 healthy volunteers were enrolled
in the studies. since  xxxd2149xxx  will be
used mainly in elderly patients, who are the principal recipients of orthopaedic surgery, the subjects included both male volunteers aged 18 to 40
years (‘young volunteers’) and male and female
volunteers aged 60 to 85 years (‘elderly volunteers’). the subjects were required to be in good
physical and mental health, with bodyweights of
between 70 and 130% of ideal, and any who had a
history of clinically significant bleeding or coagulation disorder or relevant drug hypersensitivity
were excluded from the studies.
study design

details of the studies are given in table i. all
were of randomised, crossover design. five studies
were double-blind or assessor-blind, and the majority were placebo-controlled.
study drug

the formulation of  xxxd2149xxx  used
in these studies was a 10 mg/ml solution in 9 mg/ml
nacl. the commercial formulation, a 5 mg/ml solution in 8.4 mg/ml nacl, was proven to be equivalent to the 10 mg/ml formulation in a bioequivalence study (the nacl content having been adjusted
to obtain an isotonic injectable solution with an
osmolarity of 280 ± 3 mosmol/l). the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2149xxx  were determined

following single subcutaneous administration at a
range of doses to young and elderly volunteers.
single intravenous bolus doses and repeated subcutaneous administration once daily were also
studied.
blood samples were collected before and at intervals up to 72 hours after a dose. plasma was obtained
by subsequent centrifugation at 2000 ×g for 15
minutes at 4ºc, and stored at –20ºc until analysis.
urine was collected in six studies, before and for up
to 24 or 72 hours after a dose; sample aliquots of
2ml were frozen and stored pending analysis.
assay

a method for the determination of  xxxd2149xxx  in human plasma and urine was
developed and validated in organon and sanofisynthelabo laboratories (unpublished data, organon and sanofi-synthelabo). the methods used in
the two laboratories have been cross-validated and
equivalence has been demonstrated. the assay is
based on the specific anti-xa activity of  xxxd2149xxx . the drug binds to  xxxg2056xxx ; the resulting complex inhibits colour production resulting from hydrolysis of a peptide-nitroaniline
substrate by  xxxg741xxx . the concentrations are expressed in equivalents of the free acid form of the
drug (fondaparinux). the assay can be performed
robotically, making the method suitable for high© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

throughput applications. calibration curves from
 xxxd2149xxx  solutions in diluted plasma
or urine showed consistent precision, accuracy and
linearity over the concentration ranges tested; the
correlation coefficients for both sample types exceeded 0.99. citrate or edta anticoagulant had
no influence on determination of the plasma drug
concentration. storage of clinical trial samples for
up to 7 months at –20ºc had no influence on
plasma or urine drug concentrations. repeated
freezing and thawing of standard fondaparinux
sodium solutions in plasma or urine (up to three
cycles) resulted in only slight decreases in the
concentration determined.
since ufh and lmwhs can interfere with the
assay for  xxxd2149xxx , any administration
of these drugs was an exclusion criterion in these
studies.
pharmacokinetic analyses

noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters were derived from the  xxxd2149xxx 
plasma concentration profiles. the pharmacokinetic evaluations were performed using topfit
version 2.0, sas version 6.12 or pktool version
5.0 (validated in-house software). the following
pharmacokinetic parameters were derived: peak
concentration (cmax); time to reach the peak concentration (tmax); area under the concentrationclin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 suppl. 2

time curve up to the last measurable concentration
using the trapezoidal rule (auc0-t); absolute bioavailability (f) [f = (aucsc × doseiv)/(auciv ×
dosesc)]; elimination rate constant associated with
the terminal elimination phase (lambdaz); half-life associated with lambdaz [t1⁄2z = 0.693/lambdaz]; auc extrapolated
to infinity (auc∞) [auc = auc0-t + ct/lambdaz]; total
plasma clearance (cl for intravenous dose, cl/f
for subcutaneous doses) [cl(/f) = dose/auc];
distribution volume associated with terminal elimination phase (vz) [vz(/f) = cl(/f)/lambdaz]. renal
clearance (clr) was calculated according to the
equation clr = ae0-t/auc0-t where t is the time at
which  xxxd2149xxx  concentrations in both
plasma and urine were measurable. ae0-t was calculated from the urine concentrations and volumes
as the sum of amounts excreted between times 0
and t. auc0-t was calculated from the concentration-time data by means of the linear trapezoidal
rule.
accumulation during once-daily administration
was described by calculating the ratios of cmax and
auc between 0 and 24 hours (auc24h) at steady
state and after the first dose.
for each of the planned dosage levels, descriptive statistics (mean, sd, median and range) of the
pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated.
the absolute bioavailability (f) of the subcutaneous versus intravenous administration was assessed at the 4mg dose level on the basis of auc,

using a bioequivalence approach. point estimates
and 90% confidence interval (ci) for the dosenormalised aucsc/auciv ratio were calculated for
the pairwise comparison of the subcutaneous study
treatment with the intravenous treatment. the interval of 80 to 125% (0.80 to 1.25) was used as
bioequivalence range for the auc ratios.
potential deviations from dose proportionality
of the subcutaneous treatments were evaluated for
cmax and aucinf, in a mixed-effects model using
the following log-transformed power model:
log(parameter) = log(alpha) + beta • log(dose) + gender + period. an approximation of the appropriate
number of degrees of freedom (df) was calculated
using satterthwaite’s procedure. estimates with
95% ci for the increases in cmax and aucinf associated with an r-fold increase in dose were calculated by exponentiation of r to the power of the
estimated value of beta. one specific case was considered: r = 2, the effect of doubling the dose.

 xxxd2149xxx  pharmacokinetics in volunteers

pharmacokinetics
absorption

the pharmacokinetic parameters obtained after
a single dose of  xxxd2149xxx  are summarised in table iii.  xxxd2149xxx  was
completely and rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration. the estimated bioavailability
was complete (107%; 90% ci 102 to 112%) by
comparison of a 4mg subcutaneous versus intravenous dose. similar distribution volumes and
plasma clearances after both routes of administration further confirmed complete bioavailability.
absorption was rapid after a single 2.5mg subcutaneous dose: mean ± sd times to reach cmax/2
and cmax were 25 ± 5 minutes and 1.7 ± 0.4 hours,
respectively. mean plasma concentrations remained above cmax/2 for 11.0 ± 1.4 hours. the
plasma concentration-time profile after a single
2.5mg dose is shown in figure 1. within- and total-subject variability of absorption were small:
5.5 and 11.6%, respectively, for cmax and 4.4 and
17.5% for auc.
at higher subcutaneous doses up to 10mg, no
modification of the absorption rate was observed
based on tmax values (table iii).
absorption data following once-daily subcutaneous administration of 4 and 10mg doses of
 xxxd2149xxx  showed that steady state was
reached after 3 to 4 days. tmax was observed approximately 2 hours after administration at steady
state, and the accumulation ratios of cmax and
auc24h from single dose to steady state were approximately 1.3 (table iv).
distribution

no major changes were observed for the distribution volume estimated after single subcutaneous
and intravenous doses. the values obtained
showed a distribution of  xxxd2149xxx  limited to blood volume (table iii). in vitro studies
have demonstrated minimal binding and/or distribution of  xxxd2149xxx  to erythrocytes
(<6%) independently of the concentration in the
range from 0.05 to 50 mg/l.  xxxd2149xxx 
is highly bound to plasma proteins (>97%) for concentrations below 2 mg/l with a specific binding

to  xxxg2056xxx  and with negligible nonspecific binding
to albumin and alpha1-glycoprotein (this supplement).[10]
metabolism

in vitro studies on human liver fractions have
shown no evidence of  xxxd2149xxx  metabolism by the liver and no potential of  xxxd2149xxx  to inhibit cytochrome p450 isoenzymes.[11] the majority of the fondaparinux
sodium dose administered subcutaneously or intravenously is excreted unchanged in urine (up to
80%). the  xxxg741xxx  activity recovered in urine
and detected by the assay described for
 xxxd2149xxx  has been shown to be related
only to unchanged compound.
excretion and elimination

parameters obtained after intravenous or subcutaneous administration were consistent (table iii).
over the dose range tested (2 to 20mg), the percentage of the dose excreted in urine up to 72 hours
after administration was 64 to 77%. the plasma
terminal half-life of  xxxd2149xxx  after a
2.5mg dose subcutaneously was 17 hours in young
volunteers and 21 hours in elderly volunteers.
plasma clearance ranged from 5.1 to 7.9 ml/min
and renal clearance from 4.0 to 7.9 ml/min. there
were no major differences between doses for terminal half-life and fraction of dose excreted in
urine. clr estimate, free fraction (fu) and the normal glomerular filtration rate (gfr; 120 ml/min)
were indicative of the occurrence of secretion processes, since clr exceeded the contribution of
glomerular filtration (fu × gfr = 1.7 to 3.6
ml/min).
pharmacokinetic data obtained at steady state
showed that the excretion and elimination of
 xxxd2149xxx  after repeated administration were similar to those observed after a single
dose (table iii).
dose proportionality

the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2149xxx 
were essentially linear, as shown by data obtained
after both intravenous and subcutaneous administration to young or elderly volunteers (figure 2).

2.5mg. loq = limit of quantification (0.042 mg/l).

pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2149xxx  were
linear in the range 2 to 8mg after a single subcutaneous dose: a mean 2-fold increase in dose led to
mean 1.91-fold (1.87 to 1.96) and 1.95-fold (1.89
to 2.01) increases in cmax and auc, respectively.
in the dose range 2 to 20mg after a single intravenous dose, cmax and auc increased slightly less
than expected by dose proportionality. a 2-fold
increase in dose resulted in 1.71-fold (1.66 to 1.77)
and 1.73-fold (1.67 to 1.80) increases in cmax and
auc, respectively. after repeated subcutaneous
doses, no major deviation from dose proportionality was observed.
safety

administration of  xxxd2149xxx  by both
intravenous and subcutaneous routes was well tolerated in healthy volunteers. the adverse events
described below were observed at doses higher

7

than the therapeutic range used in clinical development. only one serious adverse event was reported – a case of unstable angina occurring 20
days after a single 20mg intravenous dose of
 xxxd2149xxx . the most common adverse
events were headache and gastrointestinal disorders, including diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting,
which were of mild to moderate intensity. assessment of routine laboratory and vital signs did not
reveal any clinically relevant abnormalities or
changes compared with screening values.
discussion
 xxxd2149xxx  has advantages over the
existing therapeutic options for the prevention and
treatment of thrombotic disease. it has been approved for thromboprophylaxis in major orthopaedic surgery and showed superior efficacy to the
lmwh enoxaparin (>50%; p < 0.001 at 2.5mg
once daily).[12]  xxxd2149xxx  is a single
homogeneous, totally synthetic chemical entity
that can be quantified accurately by physicochemical methods. plasma concentrations of  xxxd2149xxx  can be measured gravimetrically
by a chromogenic assay, such gravimetric expression being scientifically valid on a molecular basis,
since there is no evidence of  xxxd2149xxx 
metabolism in vivo.
in healthy volunteers, the absorption of  xxxd2149xxx  is rapid and complete, and its relatively long half-life makes the drug suitable for
once-daily administration. there is no evidence

would consequently be simpler than for other antithrombotic agents.
 xxxd2149xxx  has been compared with
the lmwh enoxaparin in more than 7000 patients
undergoing major orthopaedic surgery.[12,17-20] its
superior efficacy in the prevention of venous
thromboembolism was demonstrated; its pharmacokinetic profile may have contributed to this. in
contrast to enoxaparin,  xxxd2149xxx  combines a rapid onset of action with a long terminal
half-life that permits once-daily administration
and results in complete 24-hour coverage.

values of area under the concentration-time curve (auc) as a
function of dose after subcutaneous and intravenous administration to healthy volunteers.

for metabolism of  xxxd2149xxx , either in
vitro or in vivo, and excretion of the unchanged
compound is almost completely renal. distribution
is consistent with the blood and extracellular compartments. the within- and total-subject variability
in these studies was low (<5.5 and <17.5%, respectively) in both young and elderly volunteers, indicating that the pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux
sodium are predictable. this in turn suggests that
the need for drug monitoring in clinical practice is
unlikely. interaction with drugs likely to be given
concomitantly with  xxxd2149xxx  has been
shown to be unlikely.[13-15] the reason for low variability and unlikely drug interactions may be the
absence of significant binding to plasma proteins
other than  xxxg2056xxx [16] and the fact that fondaparinux
sodium is not metabolised.
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2149xxx 
in healthy elderly volunteers and patients receiving
the drug for the proposed indication of prophylaxis
of venous thromboembolism have been found to be
consistent. in phase iii trials,  xxxd2149xxx 
2.5mg was given to all patients without the need
for monitoring. moreover, in a specific clinical setting the same dosage may be administered to all
patients without weight adjustment. the management of patients treated with  xxxd2149xxx

conclusion
 xxxd2149xxx  demonstrates a number
of advantages over existing antithrombotic therapies. its favourable pharmacokinetic profile is
likely to play an important role in the major advance that  xxxd2149xxx  represents in the
prevention and treatment of thrombotic disorders.
