abstract-the
solid state molecular structures of methoxypromazine and n-monodesmethyl chlorpromazine sulphoxide were determined by x-ray crystallography, as an extension of previous studies
on the molecular structures of chlorpromazine sulphoxide and  xxxd2474xxx  sulphoxide. the
binding affinities of phenothiazine drugs and metabolites with known crystal structures to dopaminergic,
alpha adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors in rat brain were examined using radio-ligand
binding techniques. comparison of their solid state molecular structures and potencies in neurotransmitter receptor binding reveals that these compounds exist in two different conformations: one,
associated with low biological activity, has an angle between the planes of the two aryl rings in the range
of 155-160”, and a torsion angle of -80 to -84” around the n(lo)-c bond of the side-chain, calculated
from the substituted benzene ring. in the other conformation, which is found in the biologically active
derivatives, the angle between the planes of the two aryl rings is in the range of 134-145”, and the
torsion angle around the n(lo)-c bond of the side-chain is in the range of 64-69” or 129-144”. the
“active” and “inactive” conformations thus have the side-chain on opposite sides of the ring system.

a substantial body of evidence has demonstrated
that neuroleptic drugs exert their clinical effects
mainly through antagonism of dopamine receptors
in the brain [ 1,2], as originally suggested by carlsson
and lindqvist in 1963 [3]. sub-groups of dopamine
receptors have been identified, one (dl) associated
with adenylate cyclase, and another (d2) not linked
with the adenylate cyclase, which is labelled by 3hbutyrophenones
[2]. it has been suggested that both
receptors may exist in two different, interconvertible
states [4]. although phenothiazine drugs are active
in binding to both dl and d2 receptors, the current
concept is that their antipsychotic action is mediated
mainly via the d2 receptors [2,5].
many structure-activity
relationship studies have
been done in the search for an active conformation
of neuroleptics
[6-141, but the molecular conformational requirements for the therapeutic effects
of antipsychotic drugs are still obscure. it has been
suggested that phenothiazines mimic the 3-dimensional tram conformation of dopamine in their interaction with dopamine receptors in the brain [ 151, and
also that this conformational similarity is due to van
der waals interactions between the 2-substituent on
the phenothiazine nucleus and the nitrogen atom at
the side-chain [16]. the latter hypothesis has,
however, been rejected by others on the basis of
interatomic distances in the known crystal structures
of psychoactive
phenothiazines
[17]. potential
energy calculations and comparisons of the solid
state structures of a number of phenothiazine derivatives indicate that the influence of the 2-substituent
on the neuroleptic potency is due to direct interaction
between this substituent and the receptor, and not

to conformational

changes induced by the 2-substituent in the rest of the molecule [ll, 17,181.
potential energy calculations [18] have demonstrated a certain rotational degree of freedom of the
of the phenothiazine
derivatives,
side-chain
especially for bond no. 4 in fig. 1. in general, the
resemblance of solid state molecular conformations
to the conformation at the dopamine receptor has
been questioned for antipsychotic drugs having
flexible molecular structures [l, lo].
many antipsychotic drugs also have high binding
affinities to central a-adrenergic receptors, and the
relative affinities for cul adrenergic and dopaminergic
 xxxg656xxx  binding sites have been proposed as an
index of their relative potencies in eliciting sideeffects like orthostatic hypotension and sedation
[19,20]. the clinical potencies of a series of neuroleptic drugs showed, however, no correlation with
their potencies in in vitro ml-adrenergic receptor
binding [21]. schizophrenic patients had an increased
number of cu2-receptor binding sites in platelets,
and the authors suggested that alterations in central
adrenergic transmission might play a role in schizophrenia [22].
the potency of neuroleptic drugs in in vitro binding to central muscarinic cholinergic receptors is
related to their tendency to give peripheral parasympatolytic side-effects such as dry mouth and
exacerbation of glaucoma, and is also inversely
related to their tendency to give extrapyramidal sideeffects (23,241.

their binding affinities to central dopaminergic d2
and al-adrenergic receptors in the rat, were reported
in a preceding paper [25]. the present report presents the solid state molecular structures of methoxypromazine and n-monodesmethyl
chlorpromazine
sulphoxide, and in vitro binding affinities of these
and other phenothiazine drugs and drug metabolites
with known crystal structures, to central dopaminergic d2, cul- and a2-adrenergic, and muscarinic

methods
molecular structures. methoxypromazine

(mpr)
and n-monodesmethyl
chlorpromazine sulphoxide
(dcpzso), in the form of free bases, were generously donated by rhone-poulenc industries, paris,
france. single crystals were obtained by evaporation
of an m-xylene solution of mpr at room temperature, and by slow cooling of a hexane solution of
dcpzso in a sealed glass capillary, in a therm0
flask. the space groups were determined by weissenberg film technique, and the densities were determined by the flotation method.
the reflection intensities were recorded at -150”
with a computer-controlled
cad4 automatic diffractometer, using graphite-monochromated
cu-ka
radiation. the structures were solved using the
multan program package [26], by the multiple
tangent-formula direct method. full crystallographic
data will be published elsewhere.
receptor binding. the binding affinities of chlorpromazine, methoxypromazine,
 xxxd2474xxx 
and some of their metabolites to dopaminergic d2,
al-adrenergic,
&2-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic ml receptors were studied in brains from
male sprague-dawley
rats, by essentially the same
technique as in a previous study [27]. the following
radioligands and specific displacers were used: 3hwb4101 and norepinephrine for al-adrenergic,
3hohimbine and norepinephrine
for a2-adrenergic,
yh-quinuclidinyl
benzilate (3h-qnb) and oxotremorine for muscarinic cholinergic ml, and 3h-spiroperidol and +butaclamol for dopaminergic  xxxg656xxx  binding.
the experiments were repeated on 4-6 different
days, using four different drug or metabolite concentrations in each experiment.

four torsion angles of the side-chain. torsion angles (a, b,
c, d) are defined as positive for a clockwise rotation of a
towards d and negative for counterclockwise rotation,
when viewing along the line b to c.

olites of phenothiazine drugs may theoretically attain
two different positions, as illustrated in fig. 2. the
so group in dcpzso had a boat axial orientation,
as in  xxxd2474xxx 
sulphoxide and chlorpromazine sulphoxide [25].
the structure of dcpzso resembles that of chlorpromazine sulphoxide (cpzso), and has an angle
of 155.3” between the planes of the two aryl rings
(table 1). torsion angles nos l-3 of the side-chain
(fig. 1) are given in table 1 for dcpzso and
some congeners, together with the distances of the
terminal n atom of the side-chain from the centroids
of the two aryl rings. ortep plots of the same
compounds are shown in fig. 3. as evident from
table 1 and fig. 3, the six derivatives fall into two
distinct conformational
groups. one group, consisting of cpzso, dcpzso, and methoxypromazine maleate, have an angle of 15.5-160” between
the planes of the aryl rings, and a conformation of

the side-chain which is characterized by torsion angle
no. 1 in the range of -80” to -84”. this places
most of the side-chain and the terminal amino group
“below” the ring system when viewed along the ns axis of the thiazine ring, as shown in fig. 3.
the other four compounds, methoxypromazine
( xxxd2474xxx )
(mpr),  xxxd2474xxx 
(met), methoxypromazine
sulphoxide (metso),
chlorpromazine
(cpz) and 7-hydroxy chlorpromazine (7-ohcpz), are more folded along the n-s
axis, the angle between the planes of the two benzene
rings being in the range of 134-145”. torsion angle
no. 1 of the side-chain (fig. 1) is 141” in 7-ohcpz
and in the range of 64-69” in mpr, met, mets0
and cpz, such that the side-chain lies “above” the
ring system when viewed in the projection of fig. 3.
table 2 shows the binding affinities of the compounds included in fig. 3 to dopaminergic d2, aland a2-adrenergic, and muscarinic cholinergic ml
receptors in rat brain. chlorpromazine was the most
potent compound in dopaminergic d2 and muscarinic cholinergic ml receptor binding, and  xxxd2474xxx  was the most potent in both types of
alpha adrenergic receptor binding, which is in agreement with previously published data on these two
compounds [31]. among the metabolites, only 7ohcpz was active in dopaminergic  xxxg656xxx 
binding, and it was also the most potent in a-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding.
the observed potencies of 7-ohcpz in dopaminergic d2, ~ul adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic ml receptor binding are in good agreement
with previously published data on this metabolite
[32,33].
the sulphoxide metabolites generally had low
potencies in all binding systems, compared to the
parent compounds (table 2). mets0 was the least
potent sulphoxide metabolite in dopaminergic d2
receptor binding, while it was six times more potent
than dcpzso and 14 times more potent than
cpzso
in
ml-adrenergic
receptor
binding.
dcpzso was more potent than cpzso in dopaminergic d2, al- and &2-adrenergic receptor
binding.
as might have been expected,  xxxd2474xxx 
had similar binding characteristics in the form of its
maleate salt and as the free base, dissolved in dilute

acetic acid. the results for mpr in table 2 are from
experiments with both the free base and the maleate
salt.
discussion

the data shown in table 2 confirm the concept
from pharmacodynamic
studies of dcpzso and
cpzso as pharmacologically
inactive metabolites
[34], and of mets0 at less active than cpz and
met, but more potent than cpzso in some biological systems [35].
the energy barriers for rotation of the side-chain
are smallest for bond no. 4 (fig. 1) and largest for
bond no. 1 [18,36]. the similarity of the solid state
molecular conformations
of several psychoactive
phenothiazine derivatives could point towards this
as the energetically preferred conformation, which
also has been found by theoretical calculations [36].
the most striking finding in the present study is
the difference in conformations of the side-chain
between the two groups of derivatives, cpzso and
dcpzso versus mpr, met, metso, cpz and 7ohcpz, which appear to be related to their pharmacological activities and potencies in neurotransmitter receptor binding.
the fact that the molecular conformation
of
methoxypromazine maleate is different from that of
other psychoactive phenothiazines has been used to
illustrate a postulated lack of relationship between
the solid state molecular conformations and pharmacological activities of antipsychotic drugs having
flexible molecular structures. it was of interest,
therefore, to examine the solid state molecular structure of the free base of mpr. the finding that this
structure has almost the same molecular conformation as that of cpz and other psychoactive
phenothiazine derivatives (fig. 3) suggests that the
“atypic” conformation first observed for mpr maleate is due to crystal forces induced by the maleate
ion. the terminal n atom of the side-chain forms a
strong hydrogen bond with one of the 0 atoms of
a neighbouring maleate ion in methoxypromazine
maleate [30]. a side-chain conformation similar to
that in methoxypromazine maleate was also observed
for the 1: 1 complex of chlorpromazine and a copper
chloride complex [37].

(cpz) hydrochloride, and perphenazine (per). hydrogen atoms and anions have been omitted for
clarity, tfpro and thi have two independent molecules in the unit cell.

the torsion angles corresponding to no. 1 in fig.
1 are in the ranges of 64.5-69.4” or 128.7-143.4” in
all other psychoactive phenothiazines of which the
molecular and crystal structure have been reported,
such that the side-chain lies above the ring system
when viewed in the same perspective as used in fig.
3. as illustrated in fig. 4, this includes perphenazine
[381, thioridazine [39],  xxxd3431xxx  hydrochloride
[40], prochlorper~ine-methanesulphonic
acid (1: 2)
141j, chlorpromazine
hydrochloride [42], and  xxxd3433xxx  hydrochloride [43]. the latter has two

independent molecules in the unit cell, with a dihedral angle no. 1 (fig. 1) of 65” and 145”, respectively.
four of the structures shown in fig. 4 were protonated, and protonation itself therefore does not
appear to change the preferred conformation from
that of the free base. the same was concluded from
pilco calculations with 36 different neuroleptic
compounds of various chemical classes [14].
the angle between the planes of the two aryl rings
is in the range of 134-146” in the solid state structures
of nearly all psychoactive phenothiazine derivatives

[25,38-43,44],
and does not appear to be correlated
with their neuroleptic
potency.
x-ray
diffraction
studies have shown that oxidation flattens the ring
system in chlorpromazine
[45], as observed
for
cpzso and dcpzso. the structures of cpzso
and dcpzso also have verified the conclusions of

a molecular orbital study [36], that a flattening of the
ring system to 160” between the aryl rings yields a
third conformation of the side-chain with equally low
energy, and an opposite orientation in relation to
the ring system. the loss of pharmacological activity
by sulphoxidation
of chlorpromazine
and n-desmethyl chlorpromazine
(the latter is also pharmacologically active [46]) might be due to such a
flattening of the thiazine ring by oxidation of the
sulphur atom, thus promoting the alternative conformation of the side-chain at the receptor site.
the distance from the terminal n atom at the sidechain to the centre of the substituted benzene ring is
closer to a postulated requirement for binding to the
cy-adrenergic receptor (5.1-5.2 a) [47], in mets0
than in cpzso and dcpzso (table 1). this might
suggest an explanation for the relatively high potency
of mets0 in cul-adrenergic binding, compared to
cpzso and dcpzso (table 2). however, these
differences in interatomic distances are hardly significant in view of the rotational freedom around
bond no. 4 of the side-chain. an inspection of the
corresponding
interatomic distance in 7-ohcpz
(table l), which is much more active in al-adrenergic binding (table 2), confirms the statement by
tollenaere et al. [18] that the technique of comparing
interatomic distances alone and neglecting the threedimensional aspect of drug-receptor
interactions
may lead to erroneous conclusions. protonation of
the dimethylamino group, which occurs at physiological ph, must also be expected to influence the
distance from the terminal n atom to the ring system.
although the use of solid state molecular conformations as a key to finding conformations at the
receptor site has been rejected by some authors,
there have not, to our knowledge, been published
ir-spectroscopic,
nmr-spectroscopic
or other
experimental data which have clearly demonstrated
a conformation of an antipsychotic drug which is
different in solution from that in the solid state. the
observation that a series of different phenothiazine
metabolites
fall into two clearly different conformational categories suggests the existence, not
unexpectedly, of fairly well defined energy minima.
furthermore, this suggests the possibility that many
of the molecules have similar conformations in solution and in the solid state.
