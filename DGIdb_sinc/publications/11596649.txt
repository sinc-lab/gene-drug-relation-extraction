summary: this paper reports clinical and metabolic studies of two italian
siblings with a novel form of persistent isolated hypermethioninaemia, i.e.
abnormally elevated plasma methionine that lasted beyond the ¢rst months
of life and is not due to cystathionine b-synthase de¢ciency, tyrosinaemia i
or liver disease. abnormal elevations of their plasma  xxxd3156xxx 
( xxxd3156xxx ) concentrations proved they do not have de¢cient activity of  xxxg1378xxx . a variety of studies provided evidence that
the elevations of methionine and  xxxd3156xxx  are not caused by defects in the methionine transamination pathway, de¢cient activity of methionine
adenosyltransferase ii, a mutation in  xxxg1475xxx 
rendering this activity resistant to inhibition by  xxxd3156xxx , or de¢cient activity

of  xxxd2244xxx  methyltransferase. plasma sarcosine (n-methylglycine) is
elevated, together with elevated plasma  xxxd3156xxx  in normal subjects following
oral methionine loads and in association with increased plasma levels of both
methionine and  xxxd3156xxx  in cystathionine b-synthase-de¢cient individuals.
however, plasma sarcosine is not elevated in these siblings. the latter result
provides evidence they are de¢cient in activity of  xxxg928xxx 
( xxxg928xxx ). the only clinical abnormalities in these siblings are mild
hepatomegaly and chronic elevation of serum transaminases not attributable
to conventional causes of liver disease. a possible causative connection between
 xxxg928xxx  de¢ciency and these hepatitis-like manifestations is discussed. further
studies are required to evaluate whether dietary methionine restriction will
be useful in this situation.

persistent isolated hypermethioninaemia is characterized by abnormally elevated
plasma methionine that persists beyond the ¢rst months of life in the absence of
homocystinuria due to cystathionine b-synthase ( xxxg350xxx ) de¢ciency,
tyrosinaemia i or severe liver disease (mudd et al 2001). in all instances in which
a speci¢c genetic cause for such isolated hypermethioninaemia has been determined,
the defect has been inactivating mutations in  xxxg1378xxx  (see chamberlin et al 2000,
and related papers cited there), the gene that encodes the catalytic subunit of
the two isozyme forms of methionine adenosyltransferase (mat;  xxxg1735xxx .6) (i.e.
mat i and mat iii) expressed solely in adult liver (kotb et al 1997). the resulting
de¢cit in conversion of methionine to  xxxd3156xxx  impairs the pathway by
which most methionine is normally catabolized (figure 1), and so leads to abnormal
methionine accumulation. in normal subjects such methionine elevation in liver produces elevations of plasma  xxxd3156xxx  (loehrer et al 1996). however, it was recently
shown that patients with  xxxg1378xxx  mutations and elevated plasma methionine have
low, or low normal concentrations of plasma  xxxd3156xxx . consequently, assay of
plasma  xxxd3156xxx  is useful in de¢ning the cause of a given case of
hypermethioninaemia (mudd et al 2000). we describe two italian siblings with persistent isolated hypermethioninaemia who are the ¢rst such individuals encountered
in whom the plasma  xxxd3156xxx  concentrations have been remarkably elevated. the
results of studies of these siblings speak against not only de¢cient activity of
mat i/iii, but also additional theoretically possible causes of hypermethioninaemia: mild hepatitis; a defect in an early step of the methionine transamination pathway; de¢cient activity of mat ii, the mat isozyme expressed in
all nonhepatic tissues; or a mutation rendering 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate
reductase ( xxxg1475xxx ; ec 1.7.99.5) resistant to inhibition by  xxxd3156xxx . our metabolic
¢ndings indicate that the underlying defect is de¢cient activity of glycine
n-methyltransferase ( xxxg928xxx ; s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx  n-methyltransferase; ec
2.1.1.20). the affected siblings have now each been shown to be compound heterozygotes for mutations in the  xxxg928xxx  gene (luka z, cerone r, phillips ja iii, mudd
sh and wagner c, unpublished results).

subjects and methods
case histories: patient 1, a girl born in january 1996, was referred to the university
department of pediatrics, g. gaslini institute, in may 1998 at age 2.3 years because
of a history of elevated serum transaminases since age 1 year. she is the second child
of healthy, unrelated italian parents. there was no previous family history of liver
disease. pregnancy and birth were uncomplicated. apgar scores were 9 at 1 min
and 5 min. birth weight was 3060 g. the child was breast-fed until the age of 4
months. thereafter bottle feeding was well tolerated. during her ¢rst year of life,
failure to thrive was noted. for this reason, at age 11 months the girl was admitted
to a peripheral hospital, where laboratory studies demonstrated that the concentrations of sgot and sgpt were raised to 140 and 160 u/l, respectively (normal
<35). at the time of our initial evaluation (age 1.8 years), weight was 10.5 kg (3rd
centile) and height 84 cm (between the 10th and 25th centiles). physical examination
was unremarkable except for growth retardation and moderate hepatomegaly
(palpable 4 cm below the costal margin). she was emotionally unstable and neurological examination was normal. iq (stanford^binet scale) was 87. haemoglobin,
complete blood counts, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, blood ph, po2 , pco2 , and
bicarbonates, electrolytes, albumin, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time,
¢brinogen, creatinine, creatine kinase, ldh, a-fetoprotein, copper,  xxxg500xxx ,
a1 -antitrypsin, and blood ammonia were normal. serum  xxxd2146xxx  (4.9 ng/ml; reference range 3.1^12.4) and vitamin b12 (900 pg/ml; reference range 223^1132) were
normal. plasma lactic acid was 2.9 mmol/l (normal 2.5). serum transaminases were
again elevated: sgot 96 u/l; sgpt 100 u/l (reference range for each, 8^40).
alkaline phosphatase was normal, but subsequently was slightly elevated to
928 u/l at age 3.9 years and high normal, 700 u/l, at age 4.7 years (reference
range at these ages 223^703). serum triglycerides were normal at this time, and again
at age 3.9 years, but slightly elevated at 184 mg/dl (reference range 30^154) at age
4.7 years. neither immunological studies (c3, c4, antinuclear, antimitochondrial
or antismooth muscle antibodies, liver/kidney microsomal antibodies) nor testing
for viral infections (hiv, antibodies against hepatitis a, hepatitis b surface antigen,
hepatitis c, hepatitis g or adenoviruses, and igm or igg antibodies against hepatitis
b core, cytomegalic virus or epstein^barr virus) indicated an aetiology for the
hepatic dysfunction. a fasting plasma methionine concentration was markedly
elevated at 644 mmol/l (reference range 13^45). other plasma amino acid concentrations were normal, including a tyrosine of 90 mmol/l (reference range 19^131),
and a total homocysteine (thcy) of 7.8 mmol/l (reference range 5.7^10.7). urinary
amino acid analysis revealed no abnormality except for a methionine excretion
of 40 mmol/mmol creatinine (reference range 5^21). investigation of organic acids
showed mildly increased excretion of lactic acid (107 mmol/mmol creatinine).
ultrasound examination of the liver showed hepatomegaly without increased
echogenicity. liver biopsy showed no hepatocellular necrosis, steatosis, iron
overload, evidence of regeneration or cholestasis. there was mild centrilobular
¢brosis and some eosinophils. a diet low in methionine (300 mg/day) was introduced at age 2.4 years, and was followed by decrease of plasma methionine to normal

levels. fat was not present in a stool specimen collected at age 4.7 years. plasma
methionine concentrations were normal in both parents.
patient 2 is the 9-year-old brother of patient 1. pregnancy was uneventful and birth
occurred at term. birth weight was 3850 g. all developmental milestones were
achieved on time. at age 5 years serum transaminases, assayed in connection with
an episode of gastroenteritis, were very slightly elevated: sgot 60 u/l, sgpt
52 u/l. when his sister was found to have  xxxg928xxx  de¢ciency, he was evaluated
again at age 9.6 years. physical examination was unremarkable except for moderate
hepatomegaly (palpable 3 cm below the costal margin). neurological examination,
mental development and somatic growth were normal: weight 34.7 kg (90th centile);
height 142.8 cm (90th centile); head circumference 55 cm. all laboratory ¢ndings
listed above for patient 1 from haemoglobin through blood ammonia were normal,
as were serum amylase and lipase. serum transaminases (sgot 70 u/l; sgpt
125 u/l), alkaline phosphatase (1042 u/l, reference range at this age 223^703)
and triglycerides (342 mg/dl) were elevated. neither immunological studies nor
testing for viral infections (detailed for patient 1) revealed an aetiology for hepatic
dysfunction. there was no fat in a stool specimen. fasting plasma methionine
was elevated to 426 mmol/l. plasma tyrosine was normal at 54 mmol/l. plasma
thcy, 13.0 mmol/l, was marginally above normal.  xxxd2146xxx  (4 ng/ml) and vitamin
b12 , (654 pg/ml) were within normal limits. urinary amino acids were normal except
for slightly elevated methionine (34 mmol/mmol creatinine). urinary organic acid
studies revealed mildly increased excretion of pyruvate. ultrasound examination
of the liver showed hepatomegaly without increased echogenicity or other
abnormalities. on repeat assays at age 9.7 years, plasma methionine was
602 mmol/l, sgot 33 u/l, sgpt 53 u/l and triglycerides 209 mg/dl. at that
time, plasma lactate and pyruvate concentrations were normal.
methods: plasma amino acids were assayed by ion exchange chromatography
using amino acid analysers. plasma total homocysteine (thcy) (minniti et al 2000),
 xxxd3156xxx  and  xxxd3157xxx  (capdevila and wagner 1998), sarcosine (n-methylglycine)
(allen et al 1993), methionine transamination metabolites in plasma and urine (blom
et al 1989; tangerman et al 2000) and plasma and red blood cell free choline and
phospholipid-bound choline (freeman et al 1975; jenden et al 1973) were each
assayed as previously described. urinary organic acids were analysed by gas
chromatography^mass spectrometry. mat ii activity was assayed in extracts of
cultured skin ¢broblasts (legros et al 2000). 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate
reductase ( xxxg1475xxx ) activity and its inhibition by  xxxd3156xxx  were measured in
extracts of cultured skin ¢broblasts (rosenblatt and erbe 1997). for analysis of
the  xxxg1475xxx  gene, genomic dna was extracted from cultured ¢broblasts with
phenol^chloroform^isoamyl alcohol. the eleven exons of the  xxxg1475xxx  gene were
ampli¢ed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with intronic primers (sibani et
al 2000). each exon was analysed by sscp using 35 s-labelled pcr products run
on an acrylamide : glycerol gel prepared with mutation detection enhancer solution
(bioproducts, rockland, me, usa) at 6 w overnight. abnormally migrating
pcr products were directly sequenced using the t7 sequenase v2.0 kit (amersham

life science, cleveland, oh, usa). analysis for two common variants in  xxxg1475xxx 
(677c>t and 1298a>c) was performed by pcr and restriction digestion (frosst
et al 1995; weisberg et al 1998).
results and discussion
initial studies of patient 1 up to age about 2 years revealed marked elevation of
plasma methionine without elevated plasma thcy or tyrosine, and indications of
only mild hepatocellular disease. these are the features characteristic of, or consistent with, persistent isolated hypermethioninaemia. a diagnosis of de¢cient mat
i/iii activity was therefore considered. to gain further evidence, advantage was
taken of a new toolöassay of plasma  xxxd3156xxx  (mudd et al 2000). when the patient
had been on a low-methionine diet for 5 weeks, a plasma sample was obtained.
the patient was then returned to her normal diet, and 10 days later a second plasma
sample was drawn. whereas on the low-methionine diet both plasma methionine and
 xxxd3156xxx  were normal at 18 mmol/l (reference range 13^45) and 94 nmol/l
(reference range 92.816.2 (sd)), respectively, the concentrations of both these
metabolites in the repeat (normal diet) sample rose to 467 mmol/l and
1149 nmol/l. the latter value unequivocally indicated that the patient did not have
de¢cient activity of mat i/iii: all patients tested with proven mat i/iii de¢ciency
have had either low normal or slightly low concentrations of plasma  xxxd3156xxx  (mudd
et al. 2000). concentrations of tyrosine (47 and 52 mmol/l) or thcy (3.8 and
11.7 mmol/l) were not elevated or close to normal in both these plasma samples.
is mild hepatitis the cause of the metabolic abnormalities?
plasma methionine concentrations may be elevated in liver disease. for example,
ranges reported for various forms of cirrhosis have been 25^149 mmol/l,
36^340 mmol/l (morgan et al 1982), or 33^288 mmol/l (almasio et al 1994); in
chronic or viral hepatitis, 24^234 mmol/l and 25^127 mmol/l (morgan et al 1982).
however, few data are available for  xxxd3156xxx  concentrations in subjects with liver
disease. cabrero and colleagues (1998) documented in cirrhotic patients a decrease
in the hepatic activity of mat i. in the livers of these patients the concentration
of  xxxd3156xxx  was 17.83.1 (se) mmol/l, not different from the control of 17.32.6
(se) mmol/l.
from the above data it appears that the elevations of plasma methionine in
patients 1 and 2 are greater than the elevations found in patients with liver disease;
and that the large elevation of plasma  xxxd3156xxx  found in patient 1 and, subsequently,
in patient 2 (table 1) would be unexpected in liver disease. judged by the minimal
abnormalities of hepatic function, the liver involvement in patients 1 and 2 is relatively mild. for patient 1 while on her normal diet, in eight determinations from
ages 11 months through 4.7 years, sgot and sgpt values have ranged from
43 to 248 u/l (mean 124) and from 74 to 309 u/l (mean 164). in three assays
of serum transaminases in patient 2 between ages 5 and 9.7 years, sgot ranged
from 33 to 70 u/l and sgpt from 52 to 125 u/l. to provide more direct evidence,

the plasma concentrations of several metabolites were assayed in four other subjects
with elevations of serum transaminases similar to, or more marked than, those noted
in patients 1 and 2. these patients were each on normal diets. the results (table 1)
showed that in none of these subjects was plasma methionine or  xxxd3156xxx  elevated
to the same extents as in patients as 1 and 2. together, these lines of evidence indicate
that mild hepatic disease is not the cause of the metabolic abnormalities in patients 1
and 2.

does a block in the methionine transamination pathway cause the metabolic
abnormalities?
the methionine transamination pathway provides an alternative,  xxxd3156xxx -independent means of catabolizing methionine (case and benevenga, 1976;
mitchell and benevenga, 1978) that becomes increasingly important as methionine
is elevated above normal (blom et al 1989; mudd et al 1995; tangerman et al 2000).
to evaluate the functioning of this pathway in patients 1 and 2, metabolites of
the pathway were assayed. for patient 1 (at age 3.0 years when the concurrent
plasma methionine was 457 mmol/l), the concentration of methionine transamination metabolites in plasma was 29.9 mmol/l (reference range 0.20^0.54),
and in urine was 256 mmol/mol creatinine (reference range 1.2^4.6). for patient
2 (at age 9.6 years with a concurrent plasma methionine of 426 mmol/l), the plasma
value was also abnormally high, 1.74 mmol/l. these elevations are at least as high as
those measured in patients with comparable degrees of hypermethioninaemia due to
either mat i/iii de¢ciency (mudd et al 1995), or to cystathionine b-synthase
de¢ciency (mudd et al 2001), and rule out a block in the methionine transamination
pathway as a cause of the metabolic abnormalities in patients 1 and 2.

could de¢cient activity of mat ii explain the abnormalities?
mat ii is the only mat isozyme expressed in most tissues. in adult liver it is
expressed only to a slight extent (kotb and geller 1993). the phenotype of an
inactivating mutation in  xxxg1379xxx , the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of
mat ii, is unknown. to evaluate the functioning of mat ii, this activity was
assayed in extracts of cultured skin ¢broblasts (in which mat ii is the only
mat isozyme). extracts from patient 1 had an activity of 1.30 u/mg protein, only
slightly lower than a value found in one of the normal control lines tested (range
1.35^2.26 u/mg; mean 1.74 u/mg; n  3).

could a mutation rendering  xxxg1475xxx  resistant to its normal inhibition by  xxxd3156xxx 
explain the abnormalities?
 xxxg1475xxx  catalyses the conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to
5-methyltetrahydrofolate, a methyl donor in the reconversion of homocysteine back
to methionine. this activity is allosterically inhibited by  xxxd3156xxx  (jencks and
matthews 1991; kutzback and stokstad 1967) (figure 1). thus, a mutation in
 xxxg1475xxx  that made it insensitive to  xxxd3156xxx  inhibition might lead to excessive
recycling of homocysteine (kluijtmans et al 1998), resulting in hypermethioninaemia
without elevation of thcy. such continued homocysteine recycling was demonstrated in a man genetically devoid of mat i/iii activity who had extreme methionine elevation but an abnormally low hepatic concentration of liver  xxxd3156xxx .
it was suggested that  xxxg1475xxx  activity was not being inhibited, thereby accounting
for the continued recycling of homocysteine (gahl et al 1988; hazelwood et al 1998).
to obtain evidence relevant to the possible existence of such a  xxxg1475xxx  mutation
in patient 1,  xxxg1475xxx  activity was assayed in crude extracts of cultured skin
¢broblasts. mean activity for patient 1 was 17.8 nmol/mg protein per h (range
15.6^23.7; n  4). mean activity in extracts of a control cell line assayed in the same
experiments was 10.1 nmol/mg protein per h (range 6.5^12.4; reference range
13.34.6 (sd)). in two experiments  xxxd3156xxx  at 480 mmol/l inhibited patient 1
extracts by 12% and 52% and control extracts by 21% and 59%.  xxxd3156xxx  at
1900 mmol/l inhibited patient 1 extracts by 47% and 74%, and control extracts
by 48% and 72%. thus the mean  xxxg1475xxx  activity for patient 1 was within one
standard deviation of the mean reference value, and the magnitude of the  xxxd3156xxx 
inhibition was essentially the same as that found in control extracts in the same
experiments. such inhibition by  xxxd3156xxx  has been reported previously (rosenblatt
and erbe 1977). in that publication the concentrations of  xxxd3156xxx  were erroneously
listed as 48, 96 and 190 mmol/l rather than the correct values of 480, 960 and
1900 mmol/l (as used in the present studies).
to obtain more direct evidence as to the structure of  xxxg1475xxx  in patient 1, studies
of her  xxxg1475xxx  gene were carried out (see methods). pathogenic sequence abnormalities were not identi¢ed. the patient is heterozygous for the common variant
 xxxg1475xxx  677c>t, and wild-type for the second common variant, 1298a>c.

mudd et al

together, these studies provide evidence that lack of sensitivity of  xxxg1475xxx  activity
to inhibition by  xxxd3156xxx  does not explain the metabolic abnormalities in patient 1.
is the hypermethioninaemia associated with an abnormality of organic acid
excretion?
persistent hypermethioninaemia of uncertain aetiology has been reported in one
patient with abnormalities of organic acid excretion probably due to defects in
the metabolism of malonic semialdehydes (pollitt et al 1985), and in another with
3-methylglutaconic aciduria (di rocco et al 1999). that neither of these associations
exists in either patient 1 or 2 is shown by the fact that (except for mildly increased
lactic acid of patient 1) their urinary organic acids were normal.
might the metabolic abnormalities be explained by de¢cient activity of a
methyltransferase normally consuming a major portion of the available  xxxd3156xxx ?
because there are at least 39 known mammalian methyltransferases that utilize
 xxxd3156xxx  (clarke and ban¢eld 2001), it may appear unlikely that de¢cient activity
of any single one of these would cause severe accumulation of  xxxd3156xxx . however,
the absence of support for alternative causes for accumulation of methionine
and  xxxd3156xxx  prompted investigation of the possibility that the primary defect
was a de¢ciency of one of the  xxxd3156xxx -dependent methyltransferases. balance
studies have shown that in young adults the quantitatively predominant consumers
of  xxxd3156xxx  are  xxxd2244xxx  methyltransferase ( xxxg858xxx ; s-adenosyl-lmethionine :  xxxg858xxx ), catalysing the formation of
creatine;  xxxg928xxx  ( xxxg928xxx ), catalysing the formation of
n-methylglycine (sarcosine) (mudd and poole 1975; mudd et al 1980); and (perhaps
especially in young, rapidly growing individuals) phosphatidylethanolamine
n-methyltransferase (pempt; s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx  : phosphatidylethanolamine n-methyltransferase; ec 2.1.1.17), catalysing the formation of phosphatidylcholine.
 xxxd2244xxx  methyltransferase ( xxxg858xxx ): five individuals with proven
de¢ciencies of  xxxg858xxx  activity have been reported (ganesan et al 1997; schulze
et al 1997; stîckler et al 1994; stîckler-ipsiroglu, 2000; van der knapp et al 2000).
severe and progressive neurological symptoms manifested in infancy have usually
been present in untreated patients (stîckler-ipsiroglu, 2000). abnormally low,
or very low normal, concentrations of serum creatinine have been the rule (ganesan
et al 1997; schulze et al 1997; stîckler et al 1994; van der knapp et al 2000). plasma
amino acids (presumably including methionine) were said to be `normal' in the ¢rst
of these patients identi¢ed (stîckler et al 1994), but plasma methionine concentrations have not been mentioned in subsequent reports; nor, to the best of our
knowledge, have concentrations of plasma  xxxd3156xxx  been determined, although these
would clearly be of interest.

 xxxg928xxx  de¢ciency

the normal neurological status of patients 1 and 2 seems strongly to be against
their having  xxxg858xxx  de¢ciencies. more directly, serum creatinine concentrations
in both were normal: for patient 1, 0.54 mg/dl (reference range 0.4^1.2) at age
1.8 years and 0.43 mg/dl at age 3.9 years; for patient 2, 0.56 mg/dl at age 9.6 years.
phosphatidylethanolamine n-methyltransferase (pempt): the phenotype of a
genetically determined de¢cient activity of this enzyme activity in humans is not
known. mice homozygous for a disruption of the relevant gene display no abnormal
phenotype and have normal plasma lipid levels while on normal diets (walkey et al
1997). the concentrations of free choline (12.7 mmol/l) and phospholipid-bound
choline (2779 mmol/l) were normal in a plasma sample from patient 1 at age
3.0 years (reference ranges, respectively, 11.43.7 (sd) mmol/l and 2364774
(sd) mmol/l; mudd et al 2000), and from patient 2 at age 9.6 years (free choline
13.6 mmol/l; phosphatidylcholine 2464 mmol/l (assayed in a di¡erent laboratory
with respective reference ranges of 10^13 mmol/l and 1900^3000 mmol/l).
although compatible with the functional normality of pempt in patients 1 and
2, in view of the ¢ndings of walkey and coworkers (walkey et al 1997) with knockout
mice, and the fact that in humans substantial portions of choline are normally present in the diet (zeisel and blusztajn 1994), these values probably cannot be regarded
as conclusive proof of such normality.
 xxxg928xxx  ( xxxg928xxx ):  xxxd3156xxx -dependent conversion of glycine
to sarcosine becomes especially important when dietary intake of labile methyl
groups exceeds the amount required for obligatory methylation reactions (mudd
and poole 1975; mudd et al 1980). several of the properties of  xxxg928xxx  make it suitable for this purpose (finkelstein 2000). (a) the enzyme uses a readily available,
nonessential substrate and produces a nontoxic product that can be recycled to yield
the original substrate. (b) the activity of  xxxg928xxx  increases in the livers of rats fed a
diet high in methionine (ogawa and fujioka 1982a). (c) the distribution of  xxxg928xxx 
in rat tissues corresponds to that of the transsulphuration enzymes. (d) the catalytic
rate is positively cooperative with respect to  xxxd3156xxx , and  xxxg928xxx  activity is relatively resistant to inhibition by  xxxd3157xxx  (clarke and ban¢eld 1999; kerr and heady
1973, 1974; ogawa and fujioka 1982b; yeo et al 1999). (e) finally, and importantly,
 xxxg928xxx  activity is speci¢cally inhibited by 5-methyltetrahydrofolate pentaglutamate
(yeo and wagner 1992; yeo et al 1999). thus, when  xxxd3156xxx  concentrations are
elevated and  xxxg1475xxx  activity is thereby inhibited, the concentration of
methyltetrahydrofolate derivatives is expected to decrease and inhibition of  xxxg928xxx 
by such compounds will be relieved.
in experimental animals,  xxxg928xxx  activity is expressed abundantly in adult liver
and pancreas, with lesser amounts being found in fetal liver (kerr 1972),
submaxillary gland and jejunum (yeo and wagner 1994). in humans, northern blots
have shown mrna for  xxxg928xxx  in high amounts in adult liver and pancreas, lesser
amounts in prostate and fetal liver, but have failed to ¢nd  xxxg928xxx  mrna in a variety of other tissues (chen et al 2000). during the course of the present work
we were unable to detect  xxxg928xxx  activity in extracts of control human peripheral
j. inherit. metab. dis. 24 (2001)

458

mudd et al

white blood cells, stimulated lymphocytes, or cultured skin ¢broblasts (data not
shown).
liver tissue from either patient was not available for assay of  xxxg928xxx  because the
initial biopsy had been used for histological studies before the diagnosis of  xxxg928xxx 
de¢ciency was suspected and because the parents refused additional biopsies. given
the lack of detectable  xxxg928xxx  activity in more readily accessible human tissues,
we turned to assay of plasma sarcosine to evaluate the functioning of  xxxg928xxx 
(table 2). in normal subjects 6 h after oral loads of  xxxd2595xxx  su¤cient to elevate
plasma methionine concentrations to 271^554 mmol/l, plasma sarcosine levels
had also risen in almost all instances to well above the pre-load concentrations. plasma
 xxxd3156xxx  was not assayed in these subjects. loehrer and colleagues (1996) have
reported that in normal volunteers after similar loads plasma  xxxd3156xxx  peaked some
8 h later at 6.3^9.4 times the mean baseline values; and capdevila and wagner (1998)
found plasma  xxxd3156xxx  rose in a control individual to approximately 300 nmol/l 6 h
after such a methionine load (when the concurrent methionine concentration was
about 500 mmol/l). in cbs-de¢cient patients with plasma methionine concentrations
above 300 mmol/l and elevations of plasma  xxxd3156xxx , sarcosine levels were also
invariably elevated (table 2). the above-normal plasma sarcosine concentrations
in these individuals are especially noteworthy because, without exception, they also
had elevated plasma (and presumably tissue) concentrations of  xxxd3157xxx  (table 2),
an inhibitor of  xxxg928xxx  activity. conversely, in the individuals with proven
inactivating mutations in  xxxg1378xxx , so that plasma  xxxd3156xxx  concentrations were
not raised in spite of methionine elevations, sarcosine levels were not higher than
1.8 mmol/l in 10 of 11, and only slightly above the reference range (at 3.9 mmol/l)
in one exceptional individual (table 2). together, these lines of evidence indicate that,
in individuals expected to have normal activities of  xxxg928xxx , rises in plasma  xxxd3156xxx 
(re£ecting elevated hepatic  xxxd3156xxx  concentrations) lead to elevations of plasma
sarcosine. because sarcosine is normally being rapidly metabolized back to glycine
and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (scott 1995), the rises in question re£ect not
the total rate of sarcosine synthesis but rather the balance between increased synthesis
and the resulting rate of degradation.
in the light of these ¢ndings in normal controls and comparison groups, the values
for plasma sarcosine in patients 1 and 2 are striking. even in the presence of major
elevations of plasma methionine accompanied by major elevations of plasma
 xxxd3156xxx , neither of these siblings had elevated sarcosine levels (table 2). these
¢ndings indicate that these siblings are de¢cient in  xxxg928xxx  activity, and that this
de¢ciency must retard utilization of  xxxd3156xxx  su¤ciently to cause it to accumulate
greatly (presumably chie£y in liver where most normal glycine methylation probably
occurs), and to leak from that organ to bring about the elevations in plasma. direct
evidence for genetically determined de¢cient activity of  xxxg928xxx  has recently been
provided by the demonstration that each of these children is a compound heterozygote for mutations in the  xxxg928xxx  gene (luka z, cerone r, phillips ja iii, mudd
sh, wagner c, unpublished results).
that the abnormal  xxxd3156xxx  accumulations occur in patients 1 and 2 chie£y under
conditions in which the dietary intake of methionine substantially exceeds the

amount needed for normal growth and development is shown by several facts. while
on the low-methionine diet (at age 2.4 years), during which time patient 1 had normal
concentrations of plasma methionine and  xxxd3156xxx  (table 2), her estimated methionine intake was 30 mg/kg per day, two times the mean (15 mg/kg per day) of
the methionine intake recommended by acosta and elsas (1992) for
b6 -nonresponsive cbs-de¢cient children at age 1^4 years. on the other hand,
on her normal diet (at age 4.7 years), patient 1's mean methionine intake was some
81 mg/kg per day (range 63^100), about 6.8 times the mean (12 mg/kg per day)
recommended by acosta and elsas for that age. as has been noted, on such a normal
diet with its relatively excessive methionine intake, both plasma methionine and
 xxxd3156xxx  were grossly elevated (table 2). similarly, at age 9.6 years patient 2
j. inherit. metab. dis. 24 (2001)

460

mudd et al

was estimated to be ingesting 36^60 mg/kg per day (48 mg/kg per day), some ¢ve
times the mean, (9 mg/kg per day) recommended by acosta and elsas. on that diet
his plasma methionine and  xxxd3156xxx  were both markedly elevated (table 2).
that the plasma sarcosine concentrations of patients 1 and 2 were both within the
reference range for normal subjects on normal diets (table 2) need not mean that
there is signi¢cant residual formation of sarcosine catalysed by  xxxg928xxx . rather,
it may be that some sarcosine synthesis in these  xxxg928xxx -de¢cient patients occurs
by the alternative metabolic pathway starting with phosphatidylcholine or choline
and involving successive formation of betaine, dimethylglycine and ¢nally sarcosine
(figure 1).
it is reasonable that a severe defect in  xxxg928xxx  activity will tend to bring about
abnormal accumulation of  xxxd3156xxx  under conditions in which the methionine intake
substantially exceeds the requirement. less readily understood are the marked rises
in plasma methionine that also occur. presumably there are one or more feedback
mechanisms whereby accumulated  xxxd3156xxx  downregulates the £ux from methionine
to  xxxd3156xxx .  xxxd3156xxx  inhibits mat ii, and to a lesser extent mat i, whereas
 xxxd3156xxx  stimulates mat iii (kotb and geller, 1993). whether the net e¡ect of
these phenomena is su¤cient to explain the observed accumulation of methionine,
or whether additional regulatory mechanisms are at work is a provocative and
intriguing question.
additional observations with patients 1 and 2 that are for the moment
incompletely explained include the tendency for their plasma thcy concentrations
to be slightly elevated (see table 1, for example), and the fact that both tend, while
on normal diets, also to have slight elevations of plasma cystathionine
(293^628 nmol/l and 538 nmol/l, respectively (reference range 44^342)). we have
recently found similar tendencies for plasma thcy and cystathionine to be elevated in
mat i/iii-de¢cient patients with the highest plasma levels of methionine.
inhibition by methionine of one of the reactions that removes homocysteine and
of the activity of  xxxg543xxx  may possibly account for these
unexpected observations (stabler sp, steegborn c, wahl mc, allen rh, wagner
c, mudd sh, unpublished results).
the possible relationship between hepatic pathology and  xxxg928xxx  de¢ciency
both patients 1 and 2 have mild hepatomegaly and persistent elevations of serum
transaminases. no conventional explanation for these abnormalities has been found.
thus, a causative relationship may exist between the hepatic pathology and de¢cient
 xxxg928xxx  activity. mat i/iii-de¢cient individuals with elevated methionine, but not
elevated  xxxd3156xxx , have not had light-microscopic (gahl et al 1987; gaull et al 1981;
gout et al 1977) or consistent electron-microscopic (gahl et al 1987; gaull et al
1981) abnormalities. tests of liver function have been normal (gout et al 1977; gahl
et al 1987), nor have manifestations of inadequate liver function been mentioned in
reports of mat i/iii-de¢cient patients (mudd et al 1995). sgot and sgpt values
have been normal (patient mr c. of gahl et al (1987) and patients 2, 5, 7, 10
and 11 of mudd et al (1995)) (mudd sh, levy hl, freehauf c, unpublished data).
j. inherit. metab. dis. 24 (2001)

 xxxg928xxx  de¢ciency

thus hypermethioninaemia, per se, would appear not to be the cause of the hepatic
abnormalities of patients 1 and 2. if some feature of their  xxxg928xxx  de¢ciency is leading to these manifestations, it may then be the elevated  xxxd3156xxx . perhaps overmethylation of one or more compounds may be occurring. or perhaps the
accumulation of  xxxd3156xxx  may lead to depletion of hepatic atp. this has been
suggested to be the case in experimental animals during administration of methionine (hardwick et al 1970) or ethionine. the latter is an especially effective adenosine
trap (shull et al 1966).
the above reasoning tentatively suggests that dietary methionine restriction might
bene¢t the hepatitis-like manifestations in patients 1 and 2. a single assay of serum
transaminases performed in patient 1 while she was on the low-methionine diet
yielded values of 42 u/l for sgot and 12 u/l for sgpt, comparable to, or considerably lower than her lowest such values on a normal diet (see `is mild hepatitis
the cause of the metabolic abnormalities'). evaluating whether these relatively
low concentrations of serum transaminases were fortuitous will require further
study. the low-methionine diet was discontinued for patient 1 at a time when
the provisional diagnosis was mat i/iii de¢ciency. now that a better understanding of her and her brother's genetic abnormality has been attained, it may well
be worthwhile again to try dietary methionine restriction. our present plan is to
attempt to do so, following the relevant metabolite levels and assaying serum transaminases to provide an objective clinical endpoint. however, because the
transsulphuration pathway from methionine to cysteine may provide the primary
source for tissue glutathione (particularly in the absence of adequate dietary cystine
or cysteine), and because the present studies support the suggestion that  xxxg928xxx 
is associated with transsulphuration (finkelstein 2000), impairment of  xxxg928xxx  could
limit the availability of hepatic glutathione. to guard against this possibility, it may
be advisable to include a supplement of dietary cystine or cysteine if restriction of
dietary methionine is undertaken.
