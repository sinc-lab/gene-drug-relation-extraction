together with cartilage, brain myelinated white matter is
one of the few tissues in mammals and birds where axons do
not grow. cartilage extracellular matrix is formed through the
interaction of proteoglycans bound to ha’ in a noncovalent
manner. this interaction is stabilized by another ha-binding
protein, the link protein (hascall and hascall, 1981).
an ha-binding protein (hyaluronectin) was isolated from
human brainby delpech and his collaborators (delpech et al.,
1976; delpech and halavent, 1981). with polyclonal antibodies, the 68-kda protein was localized at the nodes of ranvier
of central and peripheralnerve fibers as well as in connective
tissues and particularly in the stroma of tumors (delpech et
al., 1982, 1986). large amounts of immunoreactive material
were found in embryonal brain and mesenchyma (delpech
and delpech, 1984; bignami and delpech, 1985).

zsolation and purification-human brain white matter was dissected 5-24 h after death. isolation of  xxxg2407xxx  was done according to
delpech and halavent (1981) as described previously (bignami and
dahl, 1986a) with modifications. briefly, 50 g of white matter were
homogenized in 150 ml of 10 mm hcl by means of a polytron. the
ph was adjusted with 1m hc1 to 2.3. the homogenate was centrifuged
a t 50,000 rpm in a beckman ti-60 rotor at 0 “c for 20 min. the
supernatant was adjusted to ph 5.6, incubated at 0 “c for 30 min
while stirring, and centrifuged in order to remove the glial fibrillary
acidic protein (dahl and bignami, 1973). the supernatant was adjusted to ph 7.2 and centrifuged once more. the final supernatant
was allowed to run through an ha-sepharose column (2 x 15 cm) at
a flow rate of20 ml/cm2/h. nonspecifically bound proteins were
washed with 10 volumes of 1m nacl in 10 mm phosphate buffer, ph
7.2, and the ha-binding protein was eluted with either 10 mm hcl
or 4 m guanidine hcl in 50 mm sodium acetate, ph 5.8.
electrophoretic procedures-sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to laemmli (1970), and two-dimensional electrophoresis was done according to celis and bravo (1985).
for the ph determination, the rod gels after thefirst dimension were

sliced and equilibrated in 100 mm nacl for 30 min. ph was measured
with a lazar phr-146 micro-ph meter. for pi determination by twodimensional gel electrophoresis, the pi calibration kit of pharmacia
(3.5-10) was used.
preparation of antibodies-monoclonal antibodies to  xxxg2407xxx  were
obtained frommice immunized with a brain  xxxd2289xxx -binding
fraction (hyaluronectin)as reported (bignami and dahl, 1986a).
monoclonal rr50 was used for the present study.
polyclonal antibodies to  xxxg2407xxx  were prepared in one female new
zealand white rabbit, 4 kg in weight. the rabbit was injected subcutaneously with 400 pg of enzymatically deglycosylated  xxxg2407xxx  suspended in complete freund's adjuvant followed 28 days later by
another subcutaneous injection of200pgof
antigen suspended in
incomplete freund's adjuvant. the rabbit was bled from the ear 11
days later, and the serum was tested for immunoreactivity against
 xxxg2407xxx  by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence.
for absorption experiments, 10 pl of monoclonal supernatant rr50
or rabbit antiserum were incubated overnight a t 4 "c with 5 fig of
purified  xxxg2407xxx  in 1ml of blocking solution. the incubation mixtures
were used on immunoblots of sds and acid extracts of human white
matter and purified  xxxg2407xxx . furthermore, cryostatsections of human
brain were stained by indirect immunofluorescence with the absorbed
antibodies.
immunoblotting-electrophoretic transfer of proteins on nitrocellulose sheets was done according to towbin et al. (1979). nitrocellulose was blocked with 0.05% tween 20 in pbs for 0.5 h and then
incubated with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies raised against
 xxxg2407xxx  diluted 1:250 and 1:500, respectively, in blocking solution.
after washing three times for 5 min with blocking solution, nitrocellulose was incubated for 30 min with a goat anti-mouse peroxidaseconjugated antibody, washed with blocking solution as above, and
stained with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine in 1 mg/ml imidazole and 0.3 pl/
ml hzoz.
immunofluorescence-cryostat sections of human spinal cord, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex were briefly fixed in cold acetone and
stained by indirect immunofluorescence with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to  xxxg2407xxx . monoclonal antibodies wereused as
undiluted supernatants andpolyclonal antibodies at 150dilutions.
enzymatic cleavage of  xxxg2407xxx -cleavages of  xxxg2407xxx  with the lysc and arg-c endoproteinases were done in pbs, ph 7.2, at 37 "c.
proteolytic degradation with trypsin was performed in pbs, ph 7.2,
with a 1:lo-1:30 enzyme to substrate ratio. cleavage with v8 protease
was done in 75 mm nh4ch,co0, ph 5.0,4 mm edta at 37 "c and
at a 1:30 enzyme to substrate ratio.
binding of  xxxd2620xxx  to  xxxg2407xxx -bovine  xxxg124xxx  was
treated with periodate as described by glass (1981). proteins were
transferred electrophoretically on nitrocellulose sheets and incubated
for 30 min with 1%bovine  xxxg124xxx  treated with periodate.
the blots were incubated with 50 pg/ml  xxxd2620xxx  in pbs for
1h and, afterwashing with pbs, they were incubated with peroxidase
for 30 min. visualization of the  xxxd2620xxx  was done with 3,3'diaminobenzidine in 1 mg/ml imidazole and 0.3 pl/ml h ~ o z .
deglycosylation-sequential deglycosylationof the protein with n glycanase, neuraminidase, and o-glycanase was done according to
the instructions of the manufacturer. briefly, 500 figof protein in 750
pl of 0.2m phosphate buffer, ph 8.6, with 100 mm 8- xxxd26xxx ,
were incubated a t 37 "c for 16 h with 2.5 units of n-glycanase. the
ph was adjusted to 6.0, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at
37 "c with 0.2 units of neuraminidase. subsequently, the protein was
incubated for 4-6 h at 37 "c with 0.03 units of 0-glycanase.
binding of  xxxg2407xxx  to  xxxd2289xxx - xxxd2289xxx  was immobilized on ah-sepharose 4b beads (pharmacia) according to
tengblad (1979). for binding experiments, a slurry containing immobilized ha, 0.2 mg/ml, was used. normally, 10 pl of the slurry
were incubated with iodinated lz6i- xxxg2407xxx (greenwood et al., 1963) at
room temperature for 1 h in 1 ml of pbs. beads were spun down in
an eppendorf centrifuge and washed twice with 1 ml of pbs. the
amount of the bound lz6i-ghapwas detected by measuring the
radioactivity on the beads in a packard y-counter.
amino acidanalysis and sequence-amino acid analysis was done
according to ebert(1986).for amino acid sequencing,purified protein
was reduced and carboxymethylated in the presence of 7 m guanidine
hc1, 0.5 mm tris-hc1, 2 mm edta, ph 8.2. reduction was accomplished by making the solution 30 mm in dithiothreitoland incubating
at 37 "c for 2 h followed by alkylation with 70mm iodoacetic acid for
20 min at room temperature in the dark. when completed, 2 pl of a
10% dithiothreitol solution were added to consume any excess of
alkylating reagent. reduced and alkylated  xxxg2407xxx  was then precipi-

tated by adding 1 ml of 1%acetic acid in  xxxd102xxx , stirring
overnight at -20 "c, and removing the supernatant after centrifugation. the resulting pellet was then washed overnight with l ml of
70% ethanol at -20 "c.
aliquots of approximately 500 pg of reduced and carboxymethylated  xxxg2407xxx  were subjected to complete cleavage with trypsin and v8
protease. for trypsin cleavage,  xxxg2407xxx  was suspended in 100 pl of 1%
nh4hc03, 0.1 mm cacl2,0.2% sds, 0.1% zwittergent 3-14, brought
to 37 "c, and sonicated. incubation with tpck-treated trypsin at an
enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:loo (w/w) was carried out at37 "c for
12-24 h. after digestion, the samples were reduced to dryness on a
speed vac (savant instruments, inc.) in preparation for injection on
hplc. for v8 protease cleavage, the same buffer was used with the
omission of  xxxg2125xxx  and zwittergent.
peptides were separated by microbore reverse-phase hplc on a
hewlett-packard co. 1090 hplc equipped with a 1040 diode array
detector, using a brownless c8 column (2.1 x 100 mm). a linear
gradient of2-80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 45
min was used at a flow rate of 200 pl/min. chromatographic data at
220 and 280 nm and uv spectra from 214 to 320 nm of each fraction
were obtained.
automated sequenceanalysis-automated
edman degradation
was performed on an applied biosystems, inc. 470a gas-phase sequenator equipped with an on-line 120a phenylthiohydantoin analyzer. all sequenator reagents and solvents were from applied biosystems, inc.
results

 xxxg2407xxx  was isolated as described under"materials and
methods." the yield of the preparation was high. approximately 4.1 mg of protein were prepared from 50 g of white
matter, wet weight, as anaverage of six different preparations
from four different brains.no significant differences between
individual brains were observed. in some preparations, 1mm
phenylmethylsulfonic fluoride dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx 
was used as a protease inhibitor,but its omission did not have
any effect, and theprepared protein by sds-page appeared
to be intact. although the method is simple and includes only
one chromatographic step, theprotein appeared well purified
and free of major contaminants. the isolated polypeptide was
more than 95% pure by sds-page. reverse-phase hplc
confirmed this result. only two peaks were observed at 56.3
and 59.7% acetonitrile which appeared to be identical by sdspage as well as by immunoblotting (data not shown). in
some preparations and depending on the duration of the
homogenization of the dissected material inthe hc1 solution,
not only one but two bands, 62 and 60 kda, were observed.
however, both polypeptides were equally immunoreactive and
appeared to have the same isoelectric point. in sds, urea, or
guanidine hc1 extracts of white matter, only one polypeptide
was detected on immunoblots corresponding to the 62-kda
band, but after extraction with 10 mm hcl, the molecular
mass of the protein in most preparations was reduced to 60
kda.
the polyclonal antibodies obtained from the rabbit immunized with purified  xxxg2407xxx  selectively reacted with  xxxg2407xxx  in
extracts and purified preparations by the immunoblotting
procedure. at 1 5 0 dilutions, the antiserum stainedbrain
tissueswith the pattern previously reported using  xxxg2407xxx 
monoclonal antibodies (bignami and dahl, 1986a, 1986b).
the immunoreactivity was confined to the central nervous
system. connective tissues as well as mesenchyma and brain
of 13-, 15-,and 17-day rat embryos did not stain, contrary to
the findings reported with hyaluronectin polyclonal antibodies (delpech and delpech, 1984; bignami and delpech, 1985).
in order to investigate the specificity of the antibodies,
absorption experiments were performed. sds and hc1 extracts were immunoblotted with the antibodies which were
preincubated overnight with purified  xxxg2407xxx . both the monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies losttheir ability to recognize

brain-specific  xxxg2297xxx 
discussion

in this paper, we report on the isolation and partial characterization of  xxxg2407xxx , a 60-kda glycoprotein derived from
human brain white matter. the same molecular mass was
determined by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody
to  xxxg2407xxx  in extracts of a surgically removedglioma thus
indicating that the protein isolated from autopsy material is
not a degradation product.
although the method used for the isolation of  xxxg2407xxx  is
similar to that used for the preparation of hyaluronectin
(delpech and halavent,1981),the results shown here indicate
that in accordance with previous immunohistological studies
conducted with monoclonal antibodies and now confirmed
with polyclonal antibodies (as discussed in the introduction),
 xxxg2407xxx  and hyaluronectin are two different proteins. first,
there is only one 60-kda polypeptide isolated, and reversephase hplc gave rise to only one major and one minor peak
consisting of the same protein, not several polypeptides with
a major band at 68 kda (delpech and halavent, 1981). second, the amino acid composition of  xxxg2407xxx  is different from
that reported for hyaluronectin (delpech et al., 1986). it is
possible that differences in the starting material,
i.e. dissected
white matter( xxxg2407xxx ) uersus whole brain(hyaluronectin),
may explain why similar purification procedures yielded different products.
the binding of the protein to cona indicates that  xxxg2407xxx 
is a glycoprotein. after treatment with n-glycanase which
specifically cleaves sugars bound through n-glycosidic bonds,
a reduction of the molecular mass of about 8000 daltons and
the appearance of two bands at 52 and 54 kda were observed.
no change in the isoelectric point was seen, indicating that
the cleaved sugar residues were not charged. binding of cona
was completely abolished, suggesting that all mannose residues were removed. after cleavage of the sialic acids with
neuraminidase, there was almost no change in the apparent
molecular weight but a shiftingof the isoelectric point of the
polypeptides from 4.3 and 4.4 to a more basic one (4.8). the
change from two isoelectric variants to only one after this
incubation indicates that the two variants are present not
because of different degrees of phosphorylation or any other
modification but very likely because of different and specific
degrees of glycosylation. after treatment with 0-glycanase,
there was another change observed in the molecular mass of
the protein (reduced to 47 kda) but not in regard to the
isoelectric point.
after deglycosylation of the protein, both chemical and
enzymatic, we could not detect any difference in its immunoreactivity, and we conclude that the monoclonal and polyclonal antibodiesare directed against specific amino acid
sequences and not thesugar residues.
the amino acid composition of  xxxg2407xxx  was similar but
different from those obtained for cartilage proteoglycans and
link proteins (baker and caterson,1979; neame et ab,1986).
however, two amino acid sequences showed marked similarity
with the tandem repeated, evolutionary conserved sequences
of cartilage proteoglycans and link proteins (fig. 9). according
to neame et al. (1986) and goetinck et al. (1987), these contain
the site for interaction with  xxxd2289xxx . however, in
more recent publications (neame et al., 1987; doege et al.,
1987), the site hasbeen changed in the amino-terminal loop,
the tandem repeated sequences apparently being involved in

5987

link protein-proteoglycan binding (see fig. 4 in neame et al.,
1987).
as noted previously, cartilage and brain white matter are
among the few tissues in the body where axons do not grow.
although the phenomenon led to experiments resulting in the
identification of a brain protein with structural similarity to
cartilage proteins, the evidence as to an inhibitory role for
axonal growth is still missing except for a preliminary report
showing that axons in tissue culture do not readily grow on
 xxxg2407xxx -coated coverslips (bignami et al., 1988).
