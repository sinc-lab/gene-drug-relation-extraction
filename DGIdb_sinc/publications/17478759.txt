objective—histamine increases endothelial  xxxd2738xxx  (no) production as an endothelium-dependent vasodilator, which
acts as a vasoconstrictor in atherosclerotic coronary arteries. to investigate the relation between histamine and no
production in intimal smooth muscle cells (smcs), we studied the effect of histamine on  xxxg1578xxx  (inos)
expression in the smcs.
methods and results—in cultured human intimal smcs, histamine increased no production, inos expression, and
nf-␬b nuclear translocation, which were inhibited by histamine h1 blocker and nf-␬b inhibitor. luciferase assay
using ⫺8.3 kb upstream of human inos promoter region and electrophoretic mobility shift assay suggested that a
nf-␬b motif located at ⫺3922 to ⫺3914 would be necessary for histamine-inducible promoter activity. in addition, h1
blocker, nf-␬b inhibitor, and dominant negative i␬b␣ or i␬b kinase ␤ downregulated the histamine-induced inos
promoter activity. in the human aorta, histamine content was estimated to be 310⫾66 pmol/mg protein in the
atherosclerotic intima, while that was to be 43⫾22 pmol/mg protein in the media (p⬍0.001).
conclusions—histamine stimulates intimal smcs to increase inos expression via h1 receptors and nf-␬b signaling
pathway. histamine could be one of no-regulating factors, by inducing inos expression in intimal smcs, and may be
related to atherogenesis. (arterioscler thromb vasc biol. 2007;27:1556-1561.)

h

istamine is a classical inflammatory mediator mainly
produced from mast cell and exerts acute responses
including hypersensitivity, vasodilation, and vasoconstriction. with regards to coronary artery, especially in atherosclerotic artery accompanying endothelial dysfunction, histamine is a potent vasoconstrictor, and accumulation of
activated mast cells in adventitia and ruptured plaques in the
cases of acute coronary syndrome has been reported.1–3 on
the other hand, monocytes/macrophages are present in all
stage of atherosclerosis and also express a rate-limiting
histamine-producing enzyme:  xxxg1040xxx 
(hdc).4 besides mast cells, monocytes/macrophages are
potential sources of histamine in the atherosclerotic lesions
and histamine from these cells would chronically participate
in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by regulating atherosclerosis-related gene expression.5,6
histamine effects are mediated through its specific receptors, which are classified into h1 to h4 types.7 histamine
receptors are expressed in the atherosclerotic intima, and h1
receptors are predominantly expressed in the intimal smooth

muscle cells (smcs) of human atheromatous plaques.8 in
relation to atherogenesis, histamine stimulates intimal smcs
to proliferate and to express matrix metalloproteinse-1
( xxxg1418xxx ).9 moreover, monocytic expression of  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-␣,  xxxg357xxx 
( xxxg357xxx ), and lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein
receptor-1 (lox-1) is regulated by histamine through histamine h1 ( xxxg1078xxx ) or  xxxg1079xxx  ( xxxg1079xxx ).5,10,11 these findings indicate that locally produced histamine in the intima
might participate in regulation of atherosclerosis-related gene
expression in monocytes and smcs, and in proliferation of
smcs.6
in contrast,  xxxd2738xxx  (no) is a powerful vasodilator and
inhibits the proliferation of smcs.12 the expression of
 xxxg1578xxx  (inos) is induced by inflammatory
cytokines such as interferon (ifn)-␥, tnf-␣, and interleukin
(il)-1␤ and by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps) through
nf-␬b activation.13,14 in turn, no inhibits nf-␬b by inducing i␬b␣.15 because histamine is one of the major inflammatory mediators and known to activate nf-␬b pathway

tanimoto et al
through  xxxg1078xxx  stimulation,16 we speculated that histamine
would upregulate the inos expression in the intimal smcs.
in addition, a recent report has demonstrated an induction of
endothelial no synthase (enos) expression by histamine
mediated through  xxxg1078xxx  in human umbilical vein endothelial
cells,17 suggesting a presence of functional linkage of histamine, no, and nf-␬b in the vascular microenvironment.
in this study we have reported a molecular mechanism by
which histamine induces the inos gene expression in cultured human intimal smcs. histamine upregulated the inos
but not enos expression through activation of  xxxg1078xxx  and
nf-␬b signaling pathway. also, we examined histamine
content in the neointima, media, and adventitia of the human
atherosclerotic aortas from adults and neonates.

materials and methods
chemicals
histamine was purchased from wako pure chemical (tokyo, japan).
histamine blocker (h1 blocker,  xxxd3050xxx  and chlorphenilamine;
h2 blocker, cimetidine and  xxxd2082xxx ), nf-␬b inhibitor (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate [pdtc]), and inos inhibitor ( xxxd2951xxx 
[ag]),  xxxg1577xxx  inhibitor ( xxxd48xxx  [ xxxd48xxx ]), and non-specific
nos inhibitor (n␻-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester [l-name]) were
purchased from sigma. il-1 ␤ and ifn- ␥ were obtained
from peprotech.

cell culture
immortalized iss10 cells derived from human aortic intimal smcs
were maintained in dulbecco modified eagle medium (dmem)
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (fcs) at 37°c.18 each
experiment was performed after 24-hour starvation in dmem with
0.5% fcs. the cell viability was monitored by viable cell count
using trypan blue exclusion test and by apoptotic cell count using
 xxxg166xxx  detection ( xxxg166xxx  fluorescein isothiocyanate [fitc]
kit, immunotech). no increased cell death was observed after
histamine treatment (data not shown).

no production
the cells were cultured on a slide glass and incubated with dmem
containing 10␮mol/l 4-amino-5-methylamino-2⬘, 7⬘-difluorofluorescein diacetate (daf-da; molecular probe), and each nos
inhibitor for 1 hour. then the cells were stimulated with histamine
for 5 minutes. for longer histamine stimulation, the cells were first
incubated with histamine for 24 hours, and then daf-da and each
nos inhibitor were loaded to the cells. nitrite content in the culture
supernatant was measured by a fluorometric assay kit according to
the manufacturer’s instruction (cayman chemical).

nuclear localization of nf-␬b
the cells cultured on a slide glass were fixed in ice-cold 95% acetone
for 2 minutes and air-dried. the slide glasses were incubated with
mouse monoclonal anti–nf-␬b (anti-p65 subunit; chemicon) antibody, followed by fitc-conjugated anti-mouse igg antibody
(zymed laboratories).

western blotting
protein extracts (50 ␮g/lane) prepared from smcs and rabbit
polyclonal anti-human inos antibody (signal transduction laboratory) were used for western blot analysis as described previously.6

northern blotting
northern blot analysis was performed as described previously.6,11
32
p-labeled probe including 435-bp fragment of human inos cdna
was generated by rt-pcr with the following primer pairs: 5⬘tggaattcactcagctgtgc/5⬘-ccatgatggtcacattctgc.

inos regulation by histamine in smcs

1557

plasmid construction
the luciferase reporter plasmid, including 8.5-kp fragment of the
promoter region of human inos (hinos) gene, was provided by dr
joel moss (national institute of health, bethesda, md).19 the
5⬘-serial deletion constructs were generated by appropriate restriction enzyme digestion. mutation of the nf-␬b motif (kb4 located at
⫺3922to ⫺3914) was generated from the ncoi construct (see the
motif map in figure 3) by a substitution of cc to aa (⫺3915 and
⫺3914). expression vectors for dominant negative i␬b␣ and ikk␤
were provided by dr anning linn (chicago university, chicago,
ill).20

luciferase assay
the smcs cultured in 12-well plates were transfected with the
plasmids (1.6 ␮g/well) by lipofectamine (invitrogen) for 4 hours, and
then incubated with histamine, histamine h1 and h2 blocker, and
pdtc for 16 hours. the plasmids expressing dominant negative
i␬b␣ or i␬b kinase ␤ (ikk␤) was used for cotransfection (0.4 ␮g
each/well). the luciferase activity was normalized by
␤-galactosidase activity obtained by cotransfection of 0.1 ␮g of
␤-gal– expressing plasmid.

electrophoretic mobility shift assay
nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described.21 the ncoi
construct includes 4 potential nf-␬b motifs (named kb1 to kb4
located at ⫺4663 to ⫺4654, ⫺4366 to ⫺4357, ⫺4310 to ⫺4299,
and ⫺3922to ⫺3914, respectively). thus 4 double-stranded oligonucleotide probes including the nf-␬b sites were used (kb1,
5⬘-caaccccaggtaatcctcagctccta-3⬘; kb2, 5⬘-taataaatggaaagcccagggcctgg-3⬘; kb3, 5⬘-tgcaagctgggactccagggttgtag-3⬘; and kb4; 5⬘-gaggagggcatttctccacagcagcc-3⬘; see the motif map in figure 3).
these probes were biotin-labeled at their 3⬘-end by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (pierce). nuclear extract (5 ␮g) and labeled
probe (20 fmol) were incubated and applied to electrophoretic
mobility shift assay (emsa) according to the manufacturer’s instruction (lightshift chmiluminescent emsa kit, pierce). for
antibody supershift experiments, 2 ␮g of rabbit polyclonal antibodies
specific for nf-␬b (p65 subunit; upstate biotechnology) were
incubated with the nuclear extract at 4°c for 1 hour before incubation
with the labeled probes.

measurement of histamine content in human
aortic tissues
the human aortic tissues obtained from autopsy cases were separated
into the intima, media, and adventitia and the histamine content was
measured by an elisa kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction (immunotech). protein concentration of the extracts was determined by a bio-rad protein assay (bio-rad). a written consent for
the autopsy and research use of the materials was obtained according
to the guideline of japanese society of pathology and approved by
the kenwakai ohtemaci hospital, kokurakita-ku, kitakyushu, japan, where the autopsy was performed.

statistical analysis
data are presented as mean⫾sd at least obtained from triplicate
studies. anova was applied and differences at p⬍0.05 were
considered significant.

results
no production from smcs
because histamine stimulates the smcs to activate  xxxg1078xxx 
and ca2⫹ signaling pathway,9,10 enhancement of nos enzymatic activity and no production were measured by
daf-da method. histamine treatment (5 minutes) increased
no production, which was partially inhibited by  xxxg1577xxx 
 xxxd1350xxx -ni and completely by nonspecific nos inhibitor

pdtc (25␮mol/l) but not h2 blocker (cimetidine; 10␮mol/l). as

l-name, but not by inos inhibitor ag (figure 1a, upper
row). on the other hand, no production after 24-hour
stimulation with histamine was inhibited by ag (figure 1a,
lower row). this suggested that histamine increased no
production mediated through the induction of inos expression after the longer histamine treatment. the production of
no measured by the concentration of nitrite in the medium
reached maximum at 24 to 36 hours after histamine stimulation (figure 1b). during 24-hour incubation, histamine increased nitrite production in a dose dependent manner. the
histamine-induced nitrite production was inhibited by nf-␬b
inhibitor pdtc or ag (figure 1c).

il-1␤ and 5 ng/ml of ifn-␥) treatment increased inos protein
(24 hours) and mrna expression (16 hours). b, for inhibition
studies, the cells were pretreated for 1 hour by 10 ␮mol/l  xxxd3050xxx  or cimetidine and 25 ␮mol/l pdtc and then incubated
with 100 ␮mol/l histamine. histamine h1 blocker (pyr) and
nf-␬b inhibitor pdtc (25 ␮mol/l) downregulated histamineinduced (100 ␮mol/l) inos mrna expression. the inos

inos expression by histamine
as well as cytokine mixture (cm; 0.5 ng/ml of il-1␤ and 5
ng/ml of ifn-␥) induced the inos expression, the inos
protein and mrna expression were induced by histamine in
a dose-dependent manner (figure 2a). furthermore, the
histamine-induced inos mrna expression was downregulated by  xxxd3050xxx  and pdtc but not by cimetidine (figure
2b). endothelial nos mrna was constitutively expressed
and showed no histamine response (data not shown).

luciferase assay by using human inos
promoter constructs
the luciferase constructs harboring hinos promoter region
were subjected to luciferase assay by using 5⬘-deltion constructs (figure 3). the xmai and eco47iii constructs showed
no upregulation of the promoter activities by histamine.
when the hinos promoter construct was deleted up to ncoi
site (⫺4.8kbp), the activity was enhanced by histamine
(dashed bar). further deletion up to ecorv site (⫺1.3kbp)
resulted in low basal activity and no more response to histamine.
in contrast, cm induced the hinos promoter activities (closed
bar) in xmai, eco47iii, and ecorv constructs. the ncoi
construct, which was only histamine responsive construct,
showed no increased promoter activity by cm.
the promoter activity from the ncoi construct showed a
dose dependent upregulation by histamine. this histamineinduced promoter activity was decreased by histamine h1
blocker  xxxd3050xxx  and chlorphenilamine, and pdtc but not
by h2 blocker cimetidine and  xxxd2082xxx  (figure 4a). cotransfection of dominant negative i␬b␣ or ikk␤, which
inhibits nf-␬b signaling pathway by interfering the dissociation of nf- ␬ b/i ␬ b complexes, downregulated the
histamine-induced hinos promoter activity from the ncoi
constructs (figure 4b).

because the luciferase assay indicated that histamine regulates the inos gene transcription through nf-␬b sites,
emsa and mutation assay were performed to determine the
nf-␬b site necessary for the inos gene regulation. in the
emsa, the kb4 probe, but not kb1, kb2, and kb3 probes
(data not shown), detected a specific dna–protein complex
(figure 5a). nonstimulated control extract showed a dna–
protein complex (lane 3, arrow), which were increased after
histamine stimulation (lane 4). when cold competitor was

coincubated in 50⫻ excess, the complex was abolished (lane
8). the specific complex was supershifted by a coincubation
with anti-p65 subunit antibody (arrowhead in lane 7) and
decreased after the smcs were incubated with pdtc and
 xxxd3050xxx  (lane 4 and 6, respectively), but not cimetidine
(lane 5). therefore, these results indicate that the histamineinduced nf-␬b (kb4 located at ⫺3922 to ⫺3914) binding
activity included p65 subunit of nf-␬b and was mediated
through histamine  xxxg1078xxx .

figure 6. histamine content in human aortic tissues. histamine
content was measured from the human aortic tissues of adult
(n⫽6) and neonatal (n⫽3) samples. histamine was rich in the
adventitial and intimal tissues. intimal histamine content from
the adult aortic tissues was higher than that from the adult and
neonatal media. the histamine content was estimated as

plasmid, resulted in decreased histamine-induced promoter
activity (figure 5b). therefore, the nf-␬b motif located at
⫺3922 to ⫺3914 (kb4) would be necessary for maintenance
of histamine-inducible promoter activity.

histamine content in human aortic tissues
to address whether histamine is accumulated in the human
aortic tissues, histamine content in each part of the aortic wall
was measured. the histamine content in the adventitia from
adult aortas was nearly 1000 pmol/mg protein (figure 6). the
histamine content in the adult intimal tissues with fatty
streaks was higher than that from the adult media (p⫽0.0008)
and neonatal aortic media (p⫽0.025). these suggested that
histamine content increases in the intimae and adventitial
tissues during atherogenesis or development.

discussion
most recently histamine has been implicated in smooth
muscle proliferation in the lesions of stent restenosis in pig
coronary artery and the histamine content in the restenotic
neointima was determined to be 30 to 140 ␮mol/l.22 in the
present study, we showed that the human atherosclerotic
intima included 310 pmol/mg protein (estimated as
16␮mol/l) of histamine, which was significantly higher than
that in the adult and neonatal media. therefore, the histamine
concentration (10 to 100 ␮mol/l) used in the present and
previous9 studies was considered to be reasonable range for
the in vitro study.
cytokine regulation of inos gene expression has been
well studied in various types of cells, including macrophages,
smcs, and other cells.23 lps and inflammatory cytokines
such as il-1␤, ifn-␥, and tnf-␣ stimulate the cells to
upregulate inos expression in nf-␬b– dependent manner.
most of these studies were, however, performed using nonsmcs19,24 –28 or using non-human vascular smcs.23,29 thus,
the control of inos gene regulation by histamine in human
intimal smcs is particular interest of this study. the results
obtained from the luciferase reporter assay showed that ⫺4.8
to ⫺1.3kbp 5⬘-flanking region is required for both basal and
histamine-induced promoter activity and that the nf-␬b
inhibitor and dominant negative i␬b␣ or ikk␤ downregulated the histamine-induced promoter activity. furthermore,

the results from emsa and mutational analysis showed that
the most downstream nf-␬b (kb4 located at ⫺3922 to
⫺3914) is potentially the responsible site for histamineinduced promoter activity. these results indicated that nf-␬b
pathway is involved in the  xxxg1078xxx -mediated inos regulation
in the human smcs.
requirement of nf-␬b elements for the regulation of
cytokine induced inos expression was well established by 2
other groups using hinos promoter construct and human
lung adenocarcinoma cell line.26 –28 they have pointed out the
importance of nf-␬b sites located at ⫺5.8kbp24 and
⫺8.3kbp/⫺115bp27 for cytokine (mixture of tnf-␣, il-1␤,
and inf-␥) induction of inos. according to their reports,
cytokine mixture did not enhance the promoter activity of the
constructs including proximal sequence from ncoi site26 or
⬍3.7kbp27 of the inos promoter, which include the sequence
(⫺4.8 to ⫺1.3kbp) required for histamine induction of inos
promoter. on the other hand, a negative regulatory element
(nre), which is an active silencer for nf-␬b– dependent
gene expression such as ifn-␤30 and il-8,31 is present in the
hinos promoter at ⫺6.7kb upstream. unlike ifn-␤ and
il-8, the nre site does not overlap the nf-␬b sites in the
hinos but the nre-dependent mechanism represses the
basal activity of the hinos promoter.28 in the present study,
however, the basal promoter activity was not affected by the
nre and deletion up to ncoi (⫺4.8kbp) site was necessary
for the histamine-induced activity. these results indicate that
an inhibitory element(s) between ⫺8.5 to ⫺4.8kbp would
repress the histamine-induced promoter activity independently on the nre. although we could not explain the
molecular mechanism of the histamine-specific repression,
the inhibitory element(s) and nf-␬b sites necessary for inos
transcriptional regulation might be quite different depending
on cell type and stimulation.28
histamine and no have a contradictory effect on the
proliferation of vascular smcs; histamine is proliferative9
whereas no is antiproliferative.23 however, in the present
study, proliferation and cell death of the intimal smcs was
not affected by the inhibition of no production during
96-hour histamine stimulation (data not shown). this situation is very similar to that reported in cultured rat aortic
intimal smcs.32 in comparison with the medial smcs, higher
production of no by the intimal smcs is attributable to
higher transcriptional activity and overexpression of inos
when the cells are stimulated by inflammatory cytokines
(inf-␥ and tnf-␣). the proliferation inhibiting effect of no
is, however, much less pronounced in the intimal than medial
smcs.32 as primary human intimal smcs are highly reactive
to platelet-derived growth factor to proliferate than medial
smcs,33 the intimal smcs may have higher capacity to
proliferate even in the environment including inos-inducing
cytokines and histamine. major targets of intima-derived no
are not the intimal smcs.32
our previous studies demonstrated that histamine regulates
the gene expression of monocytic tnf-␣,  xxxg357xxx , and
lox-1 expression as well as  xxxg1418xxx  expression in the
intimal smcs.5,9 –11 here, we demonstrated that inos gene
regulation is potentially another target of histamine in the
atherosclerotic neointima. in addition, we previously showed

tanimoto et al
that histamine-producing enzyme, hdc, is expressed in the
macrophages of human atherosclerotic lesions as a source of
histamine in the neointima6 and that hdc-knockout mice
showed less pronounced arteriosclerosis.34 taken together, these
suggest an involvement of histamine metabolism, histamine
production, and response in the atherosclerotic vascular wall.
in conclusion, the present study demonstrated histamine
induction of inos gene in intimal smcs mediated through
 xxxg1078xxx  and nf-␬b activation. histamine would be one of
no-regulating factors in histamine-rich atherosclerotic environment and related to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
