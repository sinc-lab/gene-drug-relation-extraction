hypotheses about relationships between changes
in membrane lipids and mental illness have
focused primarily on three long-chain polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx :  xxxd208xxx  (aa),  xxxd2318xxx  (epa), and docosahexaenoic acid
(dha). membrane deficiencies of these  xxxd2154xxx 
have been reported in schizophrenia (aa, epa,
and dha) and in depression (epa and dha).
long-chain fatty acid-coa ligase type 4 ( xxxg49xxx ;
mim 300157) is a key enzyme involved in the
metabolism of aa, epa, and dha.  xxxg49xxx  selectively esterifies these  xxxd2154xxx  with co-enzyme
a, forming acyl- xxxd1739xxx , which can then be incorporated into membrane phospholipid. we used
niacin-induced dermal erythema as one index of
aa metabolism to identify a common c to t single
nucleotide polymorphism (snp) in the first intron
ofthe  xxxg49xxx  gene (xq22.3), which is associated with
enhanced dermal erythema in both schizophrenia
and control subjects. male subjects with the t0
genotype showed greater dermal erythema following topical application of methylnicotinate, suggesting that this polymorphism may be in linkage
disequilibrium with a functional polymorphism of
the  xxxg49xxx  gene that modulates re-sequestration of
agonist-released free aa. we also examined the
allele frequency of this polymorphism in 555 european–americans (ea), including 229 control subjects, 198 subjects with major depression, 58 with
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and 70
with alcohol dependence without co-morbid psychiatric illness. we observed a significant excess of
the t allele in subjects with major depression, as
compared with controls (49% vs. 38%; p ¼ 0.003) and
a non-significant excess of the t allele in schizophrenia (44%; p ¼ 0.29). the allele frequency for
subjects with alcohol dependence did not differ
from controls.

background

there is a growing literature on the clinical impact of
essential long-chain polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  in mental
health. long-chain  xxxd2154xxx  of particular importance in
neural function include omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid (dha),
 xxxd2318xxx  (epa), and omega-6  xxxd208xxx 
(aa). aa serves as an important precursor for several
biologically active signaling molecules, including prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and anandamide [brash,
2001]. dha is a principal membrane structural component
that influences membrane biophysical properties. deficiency of
dha causes mental slowing and cognitive impairments in
developing animals and humans [bourre et al., 1992; willatts
et al., 1998]. epa, a metabolic precursor of dha, is also present
in membrane lipids and is converted to bioactive lipids
following agonist-stimulated release. together, dha and aa
account for 80–90% of membrane long-chain polyunsaturated
 xxxd2154xxx  and comprise 20% of synaptosomal dry weight
[salem, 1989].
studies of plasma and red blood cell membrane phospholipid
content of  xxxd2154xxx  in depressed subjects have shown reduced
content of epa and dha [adams et al., 1996; edwards et al.,
1998; peet et al., 1998; maes et al., 1999]. in some settings, this
reduced membrane content of epa and dha in depression
may be a state phenomenon related to low dietary availability
[tanskanen et al., 2001] or the increased requirement during
pregnancy, particularly of dha, for fetal neural development
[hibbeln, 2002].
several studies of cell membranes from persons with schizophrenia have documented decreased aa, epa, and dha [glen
et al., 1994; peet et al., 1996; khan et al., 2002]. the presence of
a bimodal distribution of aa content for patients with
schizophrenia, persistence of deficits in cultured skin fibroblasts from persons with schizophrenia [mahadik et al., 1996],
and membrane lipid abnormalities in cells from unaffected
relatives of persons with schizophrenia [peet et al., 1996] are
all consistent with genetic contributions to enduring membrane changes that represent a trait marker in schizophrenia,
which may be further modified by state conditions (e.g., diet).
the potential clinical importance of these changes in
membrane composition in depression and schizophrenia are
highlighted by epidemiological studies that have correlated
diets rich in fish, an important dietary source of omega-3
 xxxd2154xxx , with lower rates of depression and suicide
[hibbeln, 1998, 2002; tanskanen et al., 2001] and improved
outcomes in schizophrenia [mellor et al., 1995]. double-blind,
placebo-controlled studies of epa augmentation of treatment

 xxxg49xxx  polymorphism, depression, and niacin-induced erythema

for depression demonstrated clinically significant reductions
in symptoms [stoll et al., 1999; nemets et al., 2002; peet and
horrobin, 2002]. similarly, dietary supplementation with
omega-3  xxxd2154xxx  in persons with schizophrenia increases
rbc membrane content of epa and dha and reduced
symptom levels in placebo-controlled studies [peet et al.,
2001; emsley et al., 2002]. in light of this evolving literature,
genes encoding enzymes involved in the metabolism of polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  or their release from membrane stores
represent potential candidates related to mental illness.
enzymes of interest include delta-5-desaturase, which introduces a double-bond to generate aa and epa from omega-6
and omega-3 series fatty acid precursors, fatty acid-coa
ligases, which esterify free  xxxd2154xxx  in preparation for
incorporation into phospholipids and phospholipase a enzymes, which mediate agonist-regulated release of aa and epa
from membrane stores. we focus here on the gene for longchain fatty acid-coa ligase type 4 ( xxxg49xxx ; mim 300157),
which maps to xq22.3 and encodes long-chain fatty acid-coa
ligase type 4, an enzyme that has recently been shown to be
highly expressed by neurons in the developing and adult brain
[cao et al., 1998; piccini et al., 1998]. loss-of-function mutations of the  xxxg49xxx  gene result in x-linked mental retardation
[piccini et al., 1998; meloni et al., 2002]. further,  xxxg49xxx  is
thought to regulate the availability of aa and epa as
precursors for the generation of eicosanoids following stimulus-coupled release of aa and epa from membrane phospholipids [wilson et al., 1982; cao et al., 1998]. unlike  xxxg47xxx  and
 xxxg48xxx ,  xxxg49xxx  shows selectivity for free epa, aa, and dha as
substrates [cao et al., 1998].
in order to determine whether  xxxg49xxx  non-coding polymorphisms identified in the human genome project might be in
linkage disequilibrium with functional polymorphisms, we
used the niacin-stimulated dermal erythema test as a biomarker of aa metabolism. niacin triggers aa release from dermal
cell membrane phospholipids which, following conversion to
 xxxd14xxx , dilates local capillaries producing readily
visible local dermal erythema [morrow et al., 1992]. since
inhibition of  xxxg49xxx  increases stimulus-induced apoptosis in
cell culture as a result of increased free aa [cao et al., 2000], we
asked whether the degree of erythema observed in the niacin
challenge test might be modulated by  xxxg49xxx  genotype. that
is, based on the observations of cao et al. [2000], we hypothesized that a functional change in an  xxxg49xxx  exon or genetic
control element, resulting in reduced  xxxg49xxx  activity and
slowed re-sequestration of free aa, would be associated with
enhanced dermal erythema in response to niacin. conversely,
a functional change in an  xxxg49xxx  exon or genetic control
element, resulting in increased  xxxg49xxx  activity and more rapid
re-sequestration of free aa, would be associated with a reduced
niacin-induced dermal erythema (as observed in many subjects
with schizophrenia).
using this approach we observed that a common c to t
polymorphism in the first intron of  xxxg49xxx  is associated with
the degree of redness in the niacin-induced dermal erythema
test. male subjects (control or schizophrenia) with the t0
genotype have an increased dermal erythema response to
topical niacin as compared with their c0 genotype peers. based
on this association to a physiological phenotype, we then used a
case-control study design to examine the allelic association of
 xxxg49xxx  with depression and schizophrenia, the two disorders
for which aa metabolism has been implicated as being of
pathophysiologic importance.
materials and methods
subjects
subjects were recruited as part of ongoing studies of the
genetics of psychiatric and substance use disorders or from

43

clinical trials at the university of connecticut health center
(uchc) and collaborating institutions. one hundred thirtyone psychiatric subjects were recruited exclusively for genetic
analysis. all of the alcohol dependence subjects and 125 of the
198 subjects with a history of major depression were recruited
from clinical trials for alcohol dependence or major depression
with co-morbid alcohol dependence, respectively. control subjects were recruited by advertisement in the greater hartford,
connecticut region. psychiatric diagnoses were made for the
majority of subjects using the structured clinical interview for
dsm-iii-r or dsm-iv (scid) [first et al., 1997]. however,
diagnoses for 97 depressed alcoholic subjects enrolled in 1 of 3
clinical trials for treatment of these co-morbid disorders were
obtained using the psychiatric research interview for substance and mental disorders (prism), a modified version of the
scid with improved inter-rater reliability in subjects with
substance dependence [hasin et al., 1996]. all control subjects
were screened using the scid to exclude individuals with
either a current or past history of major mental disorder (i.e.,
schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, depression, bipolar,
panic, obsessive compulsive, or generalized anxiety disorder)
or substance abuse or dependence. current level of symptom
intensity for schizophrenia subjects was assessed using the
panss [kay et al., 1987]. the sample of 58 schizophrenia
subjects included 19 subjects with schizoaffective disorder (11
depressed and 8 bipolar type) and 7 schizophrenia subjects
had a past history of alcohol dependence. subject recruitment
and participation was carried out following approval by the
institutional review board at each of the participating centers.
too few subjects with other racial groups were available for
statistical comparisons, so analysis was limited to european–
american (ea) subjects.
dermal erythema
niacin-induced dermal erythema was assayed as described
by ward et al. [1998]. whatman 3 filter disks (2.3 cm) were
saturated with a freshly prepared aqueous solution of 50 mm
methylnicotinate (sigma, st. louis, mo) and affixed with
paper tape on the medial aspect of the forearm 5–10 cm distal
to the antecubital fossa. paper disks were removed after 5 min
and a series of three digital photographs were taken at 5-min
intervals. local erythema was scored as the mean rating by
three observers, blind to  xxxg49xxx  genotype or diagnosis, using a
0–3 rating scale: 0-no erythema, 1-minimal, 2-moderate, and
3-maximal. results from subjects who reported use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) in the preceding
72 hr were not used.
genotyping
dna was isolated from peripheral blood samples using the
puregene kit (gentra, minneapolis, mn). six of 15 single
nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) identified in the april, 2002
draft of the human genome project (www.genome.ucsc.edu)
within the  xxxg49xxx  gene were selected for examination based on
their location (two each from 50 , middle, and 30 regions) and
suitability for melting curve analysis of natural or artificial
restriction fragment length polymorphisms (rflp). no coding
region snps are listed as of the april 2003 genome annotation of the  xxxg49xxx  gene. the 6 selected snps (rs1324805,
rs2038802, rs839408, rs839405, rs1802109, and rs1063544)
were investigated using melting curve analysis of rflp
associated with each snp [akey et al., 2001] for a sample of
80 ea subjects. one snp, rs1324805, showed significant
variation (>0.15) in this sample. this c to t substitution
occurring in intron 1 results in loss of the hinc ii restriction
site. a 64 nt fragment encompassing this snp was amplified by
33 3-stage pcr thermocycles using 10 ng dna, 2 mm mgcl2,
primers 50 -tgattttcagcgcgaggagt and 50 -ggatt-

44

covault et al.

caaggcagctagcagg with an annealing temperature of
608c. pcr product was digested with hinc ii and melting
profile determined using an abi 7700 instrument (applied
biosystems, foster city, ca) following the addition of three
volumes of 10% dmso, 20 mm nacl, 1 sybrgreen (molecular probes, eugene, or). the c allele is cut by hincii,
producing a product with tm ¼ 768c vs. tm ¼ 838c for the
undigested t allele pcr product.
data analysis
the chi-square test was used for comparison of allele
frequencies. since  xxxg49xxx  is x-linked, allele frequencies for
male and female subjects were analyzed separately, as well as
for the combined sample. the effect size (w) is reported for
these analyses, to permit comparison of the difference in allele
frequencies of the patient groups with the control group. a
value of w ¼ 0.10 is small and w ¼ 0.30 is medium [cohen,
1998]. two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures
was used to compare the dermal erythema response to topical
niacin; diagnosis and genotype were between-subject factors
and time (three measurements) was a within-subjects factor.
one-way analysis of variance was used to compare panss
principal component scores [el yazaji et al., 2002] by genotype.

rs1324085 genotype on methylnicotinate-induced dermal erythema.
patients with schizophrenia show less dermal erythema than control
subjects of the same  xxxg49xxx  genotype. for both male schizophrenia and
control subjects, those with the t genotype show enhanced erythema
compared with those with the c genotype (p ¼ 0.01, 0.001, and 0.001 for male
schizophrenia patients and p ¼ 0.02, 0.07, and 0.03 for male controls at 5, 10,
and 15 min, respectively).

dermal erythema
as part of a study of genetic and biological markers in
schizophrenia, we measured the dermal erythema response to
topical application for 5 min of 50 mm methylnicotinate, a
soluble niacin derivative, for 53 ea subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 55 ea controls. consistent
with prior reports [hudson et al., 1996; ward et al., 1998], the
degree of dermal erythema in response to niacin challenge was
reduced (i.e., redness z score <1 in comparison with control
mean score) in 42% of schizophrenia subjects in this sample.
these schizophrenia subjects were outpatients whose clinical condition was stabilized on medication. the degree of erythema in these subjects was not correlated with their
concurrent total or subscale scores on the panss.
by screening 6 of 15  xxxg49xxx  snps cataloged in the april 2002
genome database, we identified one polymorphism, a c to t
snp in intron 1 (rs1324085), which showed a substantial
frequency of the variant allele (40%) in ea control subjects. we
examined whether the degree of erythema observed in the
niacin challenge test was associated with each subject’s  xxxg49xxx 
rs1324085 genotype. due to the small number of female
subjects with valid test results (i.e, those not taking nsaids)
with the tt genotype (n ¼ 2), we limited our analysis to male
subjects. as shown in figure 1, for both schizophrenia and
control subjects, we observed increased erythema among males
with the t0 genotype. as expected, we also observed reduced
erythema among subjects with schizophrenia compared with
controls of the same genotype. that is, we observed an association between the  xxxg49xxx  rs1324085 variant t-allele and the
intensity of erythema which was opposite that observed for
schizophrenia as a group. repeated measures analysis of
variance showed that both between-subject factors were
significantly related to erythema [genotype: f(1,41) ¼ 22.99,
p < 0.001; diagnosis: f(1,41) ¼ 12.57, p ¼ 0.001], as was time
[f(1,41) ¼ 22.94, p < 0.001]. there were no interactive effects
of these three factors (all values of p > 0.2).
allelic association
in total, the  xxxg49xxx  intron 1 c to t rs1324805 snp was
examined in 555 subjects of ea ancestry. included in the
analysis were 229 controls (mean age ¼ 33.8), 198 subjects with

major depression (mean age ¼ 38.3), 58 subjects (mean age ¼
39.5) with schizophrenia (n ¼ 39) or schizoaffective disorder
(n ¼ 19), and 70 subjects with alcohol dependence without comorbid psychiatric illness (mean age ¼ 39.8). as shown in
table i, in control subjects, we observed that the frequency for
the t allele was 0.39 in females and 0.35 in males. the t allele
was observed at higher frequencies in subjects with major
depression, 0.49 for females [w2 ¼ 4.9; p ¼ 0.027; effect size
(w) ¼ 0.103], 0.51 for males [w2 ¼ 4.3; p ¼ 0.038; w ¼ 0.172], and
0.49 for both sexes combined [w2 ¼ 8.8; p ¼ 0.003; w ¼ 0.122].
although there was an increased frequency of the t allele in the
smaller combined sample of subjects with schizophrenia or
schizoaffective disorder, 0.43 for females and 0.46 for males,
this difference was not statistically significant [w2 ¼ 0.3; p ¼
0.65; w ¼ 0.024 for females, w2 ¼ 1.3; p ¼ 0.25; w ¼ 0.109 for
males, and w2 ¼ 1.1; p ¼ 0.29; w ¼ 0.049 for f þ m combined].
consistent with our findings in subjects with major depression, in this sample of psychotic subjects, the t-allele frequency
was higher for the 11 subjects with schizoaffective disorder,
depressed type (50%) compared with the 39 subjects with
schizophrenia (40%), due to the small number of subjects this
difference was not statistically significant [w2 ¼ 0.5; p ¼ 0.49].
additionally, the panss anxiety/depression principal component cluster score [el yazaji et al., 2002] showed a nonsignificant trend toward higher scores for male schizophrenia
and schizoaffective subjects with the t-allele (p ¼ 0.07; n ¼ 17
t0 and n ¼ 16 c0), as well as for the males with core
schizophrenia (p ¼ 0.09; n ¼ 12 t0 and n ¼ 12 c0). there were
too few female subjects with tt (n ¼ 3) or cc (n ¼ 5) genotypes
for a meaningful comparison. other panss principal component scores were not associated with  xxxg49xxx  genotype for male
schizophrenia/schizoaffective subjects (positive dimension
p ¼ 0.76; negative dimension p ¼ 0.57; excitement dimension
p ¼ 0.33; disorganization dimension p ¼ 0.99).
since a majority of the male subjects with major depressive
disorder had co-morbid alcohol dependence, we also examined
allele frequencies for a group of 70 ea male subjects with
alcohol dependence but without major depression or schizophrenia. the t-allele frequency for this group, 0.34, was not
statistically different from that observed in our sample of
ea male controls [w2 ¼ 0.0; p ¼ 0.96; w ¼ 0.004]. further, the

w2 ¼ 8.8, p ¼ 0.003
w2 ¼ 1.1, p ¼ 0.29
w2 ¼ 0.0, p ¼ 0.96

45

t-allele frequency for the subset of subjects (n ¼ 125) with comorbid major depression and alcohol dependence, 0.50, was
not statistically different from that for the entire sample of
subjects (n ¼ 198) with major depression, 0.49.

 xxxg49xxx  polymorphism, depression, and niacin-induced erythema

to our knowledge, this is the first examination of an association of  xxxg49xxx  alleles to any psychiatric disorder or
associated endophenotype. the potential for genetic variation
in  xxxg49xxx  enzyme activity to modify cellular physiology in
psychiatric disorders is of considerable interest, as  xxxg49xxx  is
thought to regulate the availability of aa and epa as
precursors for the generation of eicosanoids following stimulus-coupled release of these  xxxd2154xxx  from membrane phospholipids [wilson et al., 1982; cao et al., 1998]. free aa and
epa are maintained at very low levels by their esterification
with co-enzyme a, a reaction that is mediated by  xxxg49xxx .
maintenance of low basal levels of aa and epa limits the
production of bioactive eicosanoids from aa and epa to periods
of agonist-induced release of aa and epa from membrane
stores. the importance of  xxxg49xxx  in neural function is highlighted by reports of deletion and loss-of-function point
mutations in the  xxxg49xxx  gene causing mental retardation
[piccini et al., 1998; meloni et al., 2002].
in the current study, we used the niacin-stimulated release
of aa from skin as a biomarker to identify a common polymorphism associated with  xxxg49xxx  that is associated with an
increase in niacin-induced dermal erythema in control and
schizophrenia subjects. our observation of an enhanced
dermal erythema in male subjects with schizophrenia with
the t0 compared with the more common c0 genotype is
opposite to the overall decreased erythema observed in many
subjects with schizophrenia. the variant allele of  xxxg49xxx  investigated here does not appear to play a causal role in reducing
the overall lower level of niacin-induced dermal erythema in
schizophrenia. instead, controlling for the effect of the t-allele
in increasing dermal erythema responses may result in a
larger proportion of subjects with schizophrenia who would be
considered to have an abnormal niacin response. we observed
that male schizophrenia subjects with the t0 genotype showed
erythema equivalent to that in control males with the more
common c0 genotype, but reduced erythema when compared
with controls having the t0 genotype (see fig. 1). these effects
were main effects; we did not observe an interactive effect
between genotype and diagnosis of schizophrenia. a larger
sample, including observations from female subjects with tt
versus cc genotypes, would help to define the relative magnitude of the opposing effects on erythema score.
we examined the prevalence of this polymorphism in a large
sample of depressed and control subjects. we observed an
increase in the frequency of the rs1324805 t-allele in subjects
with major depression compared with controls (0.49 vs. 0.38,
p ¼ 0.003) in a group of 427 ea subjects, producing an odds
ratio of 1.50 (95% ci ¼ 1.05–2.14) for females and 1.92 (95%
ci ¼ 1.04–3.58) for males. the observed effects are in the small
range of effect sizes, though substantially greater among males
(w ¼ 0.172) compared with females (w ¼ 0.103). we did not
observe a significant change in allele frequency for our sample
of 58 ea subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. the smaller sample size limited statistical power for comparisons of schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder. although
the effect size was very small for females (w ¼ 0.024), it was
larger among males (w ¼ 0.109). despite the small size of the
schizoaffective sample (10 females and 9 males; 11 depressive
and 8 bipolar subtypes), for both males and females the t-allele
frequency was greater among subjects with schizoaffective disorder versus schizophrenia, 0.45 vs. 0.41 for females
and 0.56 vs. 0.43 for males (these differences in allele frequency

46

covault et al.

were not statistically significant). additionally, for the combined group of subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective
disorder there was a trend for increased scores for the anxiety/
depressive cluster of symptoms on the panss (p ¼ 0.07). these
observations further suggest a functional association of  xxxg49xxx 
genetic variation and depressive spectrum disorders. finally,
we did not identify any difference in  xxxg49xxx  allele frequency in
a group of 70 male alcoholics without co-morbid depression or
schizophrenia, suggesting that the observed differences in
 xxxg49xxx  rs1324805 allele frequency are not confounded by comorbidity of alcohol dependence in our sample of subjects with
major depression or schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder.
the observation that male control and schizophrenia
subjects homozygous for the t-allele variant develop greater
erythema following niacin-induced release of aa from dermal
cell membranes is consistent with a reduced rate of resequestration of released aa. this effect suggests that the tallele is associated with a functional change in the  xxxg49xxx 
gene, which results in reduced activity of  xxxg49xxx  enzyme and
an increase in aa signaling following agonist-stimulated
release, as illustrated in figure 2. while the rs1324805 snp
that we examined is located in intron 1 of the  xxxg49xxx  gene and
does not affect amino acid sequence, it could affect transcription via modulation of enhancer activity, as enhancer elements
are found in the first intron of many genes. alternatively, this
snp may be in linkage disequilibrium with a functional change
in amino acid sequence or in a transcription control element (to
our knowledge, no coding sequence or other functional of the
 xxxg49xxx  gene has been reported). our hypothesis that reduced
 xxxg49xxx  activity associated with the t-allele, together with a
greater prevalence of this allele in depression and schizoaffective disorder, is consistent with a report that cell membranes
from subjects with depression or schizoaffective disorder, but
not schizophrenia, had reduced incorporation of c-14 aa into
membrane lipids in vitro [demisch et al., 1987, 1992].
the cellular processes by which reduced  xxxg49xxx  activity may
contribute to the risk of depression are unclear, but may relate
to the hypothesized role of elevated inflammatory cytokines
in depression [maes, 1995]. aa eicosanoid products are
generally pro-inflammatory and are associated with release
of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while epa and its eicosanoid
products compete with aa and its products to produce anti-

inflammatory actions [lands, 1992; blok et al., 1996; endres
and von schacky, 1996; cleland and james, 2000]. studies of
aa and epa levels in depression have noted that the ratio of
aa to epa in cellular membranes correlates with the severity
of depressive symptoms [adams et al., 1996; peet et al., 1998;
maes et al., 1999]. it has been suggested that the beneficial
effects of epa dietary supplements in depression include the
ability of epa to reduce cytokines and other components of
inflammatory reactions [stoll and locke, 2002], which also
appears to be the basis for the benefits of omega-3 fatty acid
supplements in arthritis, crohn’s disease, and atherosclerosis
[belluzzi et al., 1996; blok et al., 1996; valagussa et al., 1999;
cleland and james, 2000; curtis et al., 2002]. thus, an excess
of aa versus epa in depression is hypothesized to produce a
pro-inflammatory bias contributing to the pathophysiology of
depression. the negative effect of an excess of aa relative to
epa in depression would likely be aggravated by a reduced
rate of  xxxg49xxx  re-sequestration of agonist released aa, suggesting a physiological mechanism whereby the observed
increase in  xxxg49xxx  rs1324805 t-allele frequency could contribute to depression. modulation of aa or epa re-uptake
following agonist release may also have a direct impact on
neural physiology. the effects of aa, epa, and their eicosanoid
products on neural physiology are not well defined but include
retrograde signaling by endocannabinoids [wilson and nicoll,
2002] and reciprocal synaptic interactions mediated by aa
products [lovell et al., 2002] during synapse formation.
finally, abnormal regulation of free aa levels by a hypoactive
 xxxg49xxx  could lead to enhanced apoptosis in the developing
nervous system or following metabolic or environmental stress
as higher levels of free aa generated by inhibition of  xxxg49xxx 
promote apoptosis in model systems [cao et al., 2000].
in summary, we observed an increased frequency of a
common snp associated with the  xxxg49xxx  gene in major
depression, as well as an increase in dermal erythema in male
control and schizophrenia subjects having this variant. our
results are consistent with linkage of this snp to a functional
change that reduces  xxxg49xxx  enzyme activity, which may
contribute to the complex pathophysiology of depression. in
vitro studies of  xxxg49xxx  enzyme activity using cells with known
 xxxg49xxx  genotype are underway in order to examine this hypothesis directly. additional association studies of this marker
with psychiatric conditions and autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases appear warranted, as are genetic studies that
examine exonic regions for amino acid coding polymorphisms
that are linked to rs1324805.

fig. 2. illustration of  xxxg49xxx  enzyme activity and the metabolism of free
 xxxd208xxx  (aa). reduced levels of  xxxg49xxx  activity allow a greater
proportion of free aa released in response to ligand binding to be directed
into second messenger pathways, rather than re-incorporated into membrane phospholipid. in skin, niacin-activated release of aa and subsequent
generation of prostaglandin  xxxg1073xxx  result in localized capillary vasodilatation. inset shows dermal erythema response for a male control subject,
