ivig is now widely used for the treatment of a number
of autoimmune and systemic inflammatory diseases (1–3).
the available clinical and experimental evidence suggests
that besides these, many other immune-mediated conditions could benefit from ivig. these include acute and
chronic relapsing diseases, autoimmune disorders mediated by pathogenic autoantibodies or autoaggressive
t cells, and inflammatory disorders with an imbalance
in cytokine networks.
ivig is prepared from pooled plasma obtained from
thousands of healthy blood donors. the large donor pool
ensures the diversity of immunoglobulin repertoire that
far exceeds that of an individual. thus, ivig contains a
sampling from the entire array of variable regions of antibodies, expected to be present in normal serum. hence,
ivig is comprised of a broad range of immune antibodies directed against pathogens and foreign antigens.
their presence is critical for the substitutive treatment of
patients with humoral immune deficiencies. presence of
natural antibodies (nabs) to a number of self-antigens is
believed to be essential for the immunoregulatory effects
of ivig in immune-mediated disorders.

initially used as a replacement therapy for immunodeficiency
diseases,  xxxd2207xxx  (ivig) is now widely used
for a number of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. considerable progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms
by which ivig exerts immunomodulatory effects in autoimmune
and inflammatory disorders. the mechanisms of action of ivig
are complex, involving modulation of expression and function
of fc receptors, interference with activation of complement and
the cytokine network and of idiotype network, regulation of cell
growth, and effects on the activation, differentiation, and effector
functions of dendritic cells, and t and b cells.

natural antibodies (nabs) constitute a large fraction
of serum immunoglobulin (ig). the autoreactive antibody
secreting b lymphocytes (b1 b cells) found in healthy
individuals produce nabs (4). it has been estimated that
5–15% of splenic b-cells activated in vivo, can secrete
nabs (5) and up to 20% circulating human b cells are
autoreactive (6).
several functions have been proposed for nabs under physiological conditions. nabs function primarily to
control autoreactivity and maintain immune homeostasis
in healthy individuals. they have an important role in

234

the selection of autoreactive b cells and prevention of
uncontrolled expansion of specific autoreactive clones.
nabs, through v region-dependent complementary interactions, control the autoreactivity in serum under physiological conditions (5). in addition, they may prevent
the occurrence of pathological autoimmunity by binding
to microbial epitopes similar or identical to self-antigens.
the immunomodulatory effect of systemic administration
of  xxxd2207xxx  (ivig) in inflammatory
disorders provides evidence that normal circulating immunoglobulin has antiinflammatory properties. as ivig
is a therapeutic preparation of pooled normal polyspecific  xxxd2207xxx , it contains a wide spectrum of nabs
expressed in normal human serum.
a number of nabs against soluble and membraneassociated self-molecules, involved in immune regulation,
have been characterized in ivig. these include autoantibodies to idiotypes of immunoglobulins and b-cell antigen receptors (7, 8) to alphabeta t-cell receptor (9), cd5 (10),
cd4 (11), cytokines and cytokine receptors (12, 13), nonpolymorphic determinants of mhc class i molecules (14),
fcgamma receptors, the fas molecule ( xxxg764xxx ) (15, 16), and
the arg-gly-asp (rgd) motif of integrins (17). nabs
and their target molecules are directly relevant to the
immunomodulatory effects of ivig. the ability of ivig
to interact with idiotypes of autoantibodies accounts for
its ability to neutralize circulating autoantibodies in certain autoantibody-mediated autoimmune diseases. a therapeutic role for antagonistic anti-fas antibodies present
in ivig has been suggested in toxic epidermal necrolysis
(ten) (lyell syndrome) (16).
clinical uses of ivig

initially used as a replacement therapy for immunodeficiency diseases, ivig is now widely used for a number
of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. ivig is used
in two distinct dosing schedules, (i) low dose or “replacement” therapy and, (ii) high dose or “immunomodulatory/antiinflammatory therapy” (table i).
replacement therapy
primary immunodeficiencies. ivig is used to prevent
infections in patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases (18–20). following the introduction of ivig therapy,
the incidence of pulmonary infections has reduced significantly. trough serum levels of igg above 500 mg/dl
appear to be adequate for preventing pulmonary infections and its complications (21). to achieve this level, a
300–500 mg/kg body weight of ivig every 3–4 weeks is
recommended (22, 23).

secondary immunodeficiencies. secondary immunodeficiency in b-cell malignancies (cll, multiple myeloma), results in severe and recurrent bacterial infections
due to reduced antibody synthesis (24). prophylactic ivig
therapy has reduced the incidence of infectious complications in these patients (25, 26).
ivig replacement therapy in pediatric hiv infection
has resulted in reduced incidence of bacterial infections,
decreased morbidity, and improved quality of life (27).
following bone marrow transplantation, ivig therapy is
reported to reduce the incidence of infections, septicemia,
platelet transfusion requirement, and acute gvhd (28).
however, with the availability of newer antimicrobials
( xxxd2178xxx , fluoroquinolones, antifungal agents) and the
risk of veno-occlusive disease associated with ivig use, it
is not routinely recommended for infection prophylaxis

(29). it may be reserved for hypogammaglobulinemic
patients (igg < 4g/l) after bone marrow transplantation
(30).
immunomodulator/immunoregulatory therapy
high-dose ivig is used to treat many autoimmune and
inflammatory disorders.
hematological disorders. itp was the first autoimmune disease successfully treated with ivig (31–33). ivig
improves the platelet count in both childhood and adult
itp (34, 35). the itp patients having anti-gp ib/ix antibody in their serum may be less responsive to ivig
(36). it is also helpful in parvovirus-19-related pure red
cell aplasia (prca) (37), autoimmune neutropenia (ain)
(38), and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (aiha) (39).
antifactor viii autoimmune disease and acquired von
willbrand’s disease also respond to ivig therapy (40).
neuroimmunological disorders. ivig is as effective
as plasma exchange in the treatment of acute paralytic
guillain–barre syndrome (gbs) (41). it is the treatment
of choice in multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction blocks (mmn). treatment with steroids has little effect and may even worsen the disease. ivig improves muscle strength and neurological disability scores
and may reverse conduction blocks in this disease (42,
43). in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy ( xxxg1787xxx ), ivig is increasingly supplanting traditional steroid therapy. evidence from randomized controlled trials (44, 45) indicates that ivig is as effective
as steroids and plasma exchange, at least in the short
term.
the efficacy of ivig is similar to plasma exchange for
myasthenic crisis (46). it produces short-term improvement in muscle strength in lambert–eaton syndrome (47)
and significantly reduces muscle stiffness in stiff person
syndrome (48).
the beneficial effects of ivig in reducing the frequency
of relapses, improving neurological status and disability
in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (ms) is similar to
that achieved with  xxxd2370xxx  and  xxxd2201xxx 
(49). it also reduces the pregnancy and postpartum-related
relapses (50). in contrast, ivig is of no demonstrable benefit in secondary progressive ms (51).
rheumatic diseases. clinical and experimental evidence suggest that ivig may be a viable therapy for
several rheumatic diseases (52, 53). ivig given in the
first 10 days of acute illness is effective in kawasaki disease (54). in dermatomyositis, it significantly improves
the muscle strength and neuromuscular symptom scores
of patients (55). in polymyositis, up to 70% improvement
in muscle strength has been reported (3). the benefit of

high-dose ivig therapy in inclusion body myositis was
found to be modest and transient (56, 57).
ivig is shown to be a useful adjunctive therapy in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (anca)-positive systemic vasculitis (aasv), refractory to standard immunosuppressive therapy (58–60). its use as the single drug
in aasv without vital organ involvement also produced
encouraging results (61). however, the use of ivig in
mixed cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis is fraught with danger. there is a risk of acute renal failure caused by the
deposition of immune complexes formed by exogenous
igg and the intrinsic igm rheumatoid factor component
of mixed cryoglobulins (62).
despite encouraging reports, the clinical value of ivig
is not well established in systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) (53, 63). ivig is used either in nonresponsive severe cases, or as a steroid-sparing agent. however,
the efficacy of ivig therapy in maintaining remission
in patients with lupus nephritis has been demonstrated
(64). patients with other rheumatic diseases, such as
jia, sjogren’s syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, and
fibrosis-associated disorders have been reported to benefit
from ivig (3, 54, 65–68).
several autoimmune rheumatic conditions, including
rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and
antiphospholipid syndrome, are characterized by enhanced atherosclerosis and consequently higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates. ivig has been
shown to reduce the process of atherosclerosis likely via
inhibitory effects on foam-cell formation and neutralizing
the pathogenic anti-oxldl antibodies (69, 70).
immunological diseases of the skin. uncontrolled
studies have shown a reduction in blistering and mortality
with ivig therapy in steven johnson syndrome (sjs) and
toxic epidermal necrolysis (ten) (71, 72). autoimmune
blistering disorders [pemphigus vulgaris (pv), pemphigus foliaceus (pf), bullous pemphigoid (bp)] were shown
to improve with high-dose ivig therapy (73, 74). in a
mouse model of pv, ivig as a whole and its f(ab’)2 portion inhibited the binding of antidesmoglein-3 antibody to
recombinant desmoglein-3 in a dose-dependent manner.
ivig prevented acanthylosis and igg deposition in the intercellular spaces (75). other skin conditions where ivig
is reported to be useful are, atopic dermatitis (76), chronic
immune urticaria (77), scleromyxoedema (78), pyoderma
gangrenosum (79), erythema multiforme, and psoriasis
(80).
transplantation
graft versus host disease (gvhd). several large
controlled studies showed that  xxxd2207xxx  not only prevented infections but also reduced the

236

incidence and severity of gvhd in patients older than
20 years undergoing allogenic, unrelated-donor, bone
marrow transplantation, especially those not receiving
t-cell depleted marrow (81, 82). in this high-risk group,
increasing the dose of ivig to 500 mg/kg appeared to be
associated with a lower incidence of acute gvhd (82).
however, ivig has not been shown to reduce gvhd in
hla identical sibling donor transplantation (29, 81). in
one study, use of higher doses of ivig was found to be
associated with severe (grade 3) veno-occlusive disease
(29). besides, long-term administration of ivig beyond
3 months has been found to delay the recovery of humoral
immunity (83).
antibody-mediated transplant rejection (amr).
ivig therapy given to highly sensitized patients leads to reduction in allo-sensitization, reduced ischemic-perfusion
injuries, fewer acute rejection episodes, and better longterm results for cardiac and renal allograft recipients (84–
86). in pig-to-baboon xenotransplants, ivig treatment significantly prolonged the survival of graft through inhibition of complement-mediated endothelial cell injury (87).
ivig has the ability to inhibit antibody-mediated injury
to vasculature through inhibition of antibody production
and inhibition of complement-mediated lysis of target
cells (88). a recent multicenter, double-blinded, placebocontrolled trial concluded that ivig is superior to placebo
in reducing anti-hla antibody levels and improving successful transplantation rates in highly sensitized patients
with end-stage renal disease (esrd) (89).
miscellaneous. ivig therapy is reported to be useful in patients with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome
(stss) (90). ivig contains superantigen neutralizing antibodies and plasma from patients with stss after ivig
administration completely blocks the streptococcal toxininduced cytokine production (91). in transgenic model of
stss, ivig neutralized superantigens and reduced systemic inflammatory response (92).
the efficacy of ivig as adjunct therapy in sepsis has
long been debated. clinical trials have yielded contradictory results. ivig administration is reported to be a significant predictor for survival in pediatric intensive care
units (93).
ivig is useful in hiv-associated prca, immune
thrombocytopenia, and gbs (37). it has also been found
to temporarily control hiv replication in aids patients
(94).

sponding to that of normal human serum. ivig, like normal human serum, is rich in self-reactive natural antibodies of the igg, igm, and iga isotype. since there is a high
content of nabs in ivig, a significant fraction of ivig
consists of antibodies capable of interacting with variable
regions (idiotypes) of other antibody molecules present
in the preparation to form variable region-dependent (idiotypically complementary) dimers. the content in such
dimers in the ivig pool increases with the number of
donors contributing to the pool. the formation of idiotypeidiotype dimers may account for some of the clinical effects of ivig. ivig has also been shown to contain trace
amounts of soluble cd4, cd8, and hla molecules and
of certain cytokines such as tgf-beta (95, 96). the preparations contain intact fc molecules which allow ivig to
interact with and signal through fc receptors on fcgamma
receptor-expressing cells, including phagocytes and b
cells, and with a number of fc-binding plasma proteins,
e.g., components of the complement system.
ivig dosage

 xxxd2207xxx  (ivig) is widely used as
supportive therapy for many immunodeficiency disorders
and as treatment of different autoimmune disorders in
two distinct dose regimens (1, 3). the plasma igg level
reached in immunodeficient patients, immediately following infusion of ivig as a “replacement” dose (300–
500 mg/kg), is 12–14 mg/ml. it is higher (25–35 mg/ml)
when administered as a “therapeutic” immunomodulator
(2 g/kg) dose in autoimmune and inflammatory disorders
(97).
the immunomodulatory therapeutic dose of ivig may
be infused as five daily doses of 400 mg/kg each. however,
some studies found a superior effect of ivig when given
as a single full dose rather than divided doses (1, 3, 73).
for the maintenance of therapeutic response, repeated infusions of ivig, usually 2 g/kg at 4–6-week intervals, are
needed. more studies are required to confirm the optimum
dose and appropriate time period for ivig treatment for
induction and maintenance of immune response in these
diseases. the half-life of infused ivig in immunocompetent individuals is 3 weeks.
safety of ivig

ivig therapy is relatively safe. adverse reactions to
ivig occur in 5–10% of patients (1, 3). common and
mild side effects include headache, nausea, chills, myalgia, low-grade fever, urticaria, arthralgia, and increased
blood pressure following ivig infusion in patients at high

journal of clinical immunology, vol. 27, no. 3, 2007

237

 xxxd2207xxx 

risk of hypertension. these symptoms can be relieved either by reducing the infusion rate or temporarily stopping
the infusion. mild reactions to ivig are more frequent, occur within the first 30 min of infusion, and may be relieved
by reducing the rate or temporarily stopping the infusion.
acute meningeal inflammation with aseptic cerebrospinal
fluid pleiocytosis may occur within 48–72 h after administration of ivig. the symptoms resolve spontaneously
and may be prevented by antiinflammatory agents (98). it
is possible that in vivo activation of  xxxg2296xxx -primed neutrophils, by atypical antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (anca) present in ivig may contribute to the side
effects of ivig therapy (99). rare but serious side effects
including anaphylactic reactions occur in patients with
iga deficiency which is associated with the development
of anti-iga antibodies that react with iga in the ivig
preparation. this can be prevented by using iga-depleted
ivig (1). flares of disease or appearance of immunemediated diseases such as sle, vasculitis, and uveitis
are other potential serious complications (53, 63). elderly
patients, patients with diabetes or preexisiting impairment
in renal function are at risk of acute renal failure, which is
usually limited to a transient increase in creatinine levels
within 2–5 days after infusion of ivig (100). renal failure
is related to tubular damage induced by sucrose used as a
stabilizer in some ivig preparations. a close follow-up of
renal function is recommended in patients at risk. ivig has
rarely been associated with arterial or venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, or
retinal artery or vein occlusion. these thromboembolic
events occur in patients at high risk of thrombosis due to
ivig-associated increase in plasma viscocity or anticardiolipin antibodies (101). there is no report of transmission
of hiv by ivig, although several outbreaks of hepatitis
c associated with its administration were reported in the
mid-’90s (102). the risk of viral transmission has been
eliminated to a large extent by rigorous donor selection
and introduction of new manufacturing processes. despite
increased public concern about emerging and re-emerging
infectious diseases and a debate on the risk of blood-borne
transmission of variant creutzfeldt–jakob disease, ivig
has an excellent safety record through the last decade
(103).

mode of action of ivig

the mode of action of ivig is complex. it is found
to exert its effect through modulation of expression and
function of fc receptors, interference with complement
activation and the cytokine network, provision of antiidiotypic antibodies, modulation of dendritic cell, t and b

journal of clinical immunology, vol. 27, no. 3, 2007

cell activation, differentiation, and their effector functions
(1, 3, 18, 104) (fig. 1). thus, ivig has multiple modes
of action, thought to act synergistically. such a broad
range of activity reflects the importance of circulating
immunoglobulins in the maintenance of tolerance to self
and immune homeostasis in healthy individuals. a brief
overview of mechanisms that may underlie the benefits
of ivig in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases is presented as follows.
fc-mediated effects of ivig
igg consists of fab regions that recognize antigenic
targets and provide diversity to antibodies, and fc region
that allows antibody to interact with fc gamma receptors
(fcgamma r) on phagocytes. currently, four classes of fcgamma r are
identified: fcgamma ri, fcgamma rii, fcgamma riii, and fcgamma riv (105).
of these, fcgamma ri, fcgamma riia, fcgamma riiia, and fcgamma riv are
“activating receptors” while fcgamma riib is an “inhibitory
receptor.” activating fcgamma rs for igg are primary mediators of proinflammatory activity in autoimmune diseases
(106). mice rendered genetically deficient in activating
fcgamma rs are protected from pathogenic antibodies (105).
interaction between the fc portion of ivig and fcgamma r
on target cells, governs some of the antiinflammatory
mechanisms of ivig. these activities were first applied
for the treatment of itp characterized by platelet clearance mediated by pathogenic antiplatelet antibodies. this
platelet clearance is probably mediated by interactions
between autoantibodies and fcgamma r expressed on monocytes or macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system
(res). the competitive blockade of these fcgamma rs by ivig
has long been considered to be the primary mechanism
whereby ivig may render the sensitized cells of res unable to exert their function of phagocytosis or antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity (adcc), leading to an
increase of platelet count in patients with itp. infusion of
purified fc fragments of ivig ameliorates acute immune
thrombocytopenic purpura (itp) in children and in murine
models, as with ivig (107).
mice deficient in neonatal fc receptor (fcrn) are protected from pathogenic igg autoantobodies. the long
serum half life of autoantibodies results from their interaction with fcrn present on endothelial cells. normal
fcrn binds to the internalized igg inside lysosomes and
prevents its intracellular degradation. thus, the fcrn saturation by ivig would result in the accelerated clearance
of igg and therefore reduce the level of pathogenic autoantibodies (108, 109).
in addition to fcgamma r saturation, ivig might also modulate the expression of these receptors. in animal model of
itp, the protective effect of ivig or ivig fc is associated

238

negi

et al.

fig. 1. schematic representation of proposed mechanisms of action of ivig in autoimmune and inflammatory
diseases. the mechanisms underlying beneficial effects of ivig in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases involve
its direct interaction with various cellular and soluble components of the immune system and modulation of the
functions of the immune system. ivig is found to exert its effect through modulation of expression and function of fc
receptors, interference with complement activation and the cytokine network, provision of antiidiotypic antibodies,
modulation of dendritic cell, t and b cell activation, differentiation, and their effector functions.

with upregulation of the inhibitory receptor fcgamma riib
on splenic macrophages and is abrogated in mice lacking fcgriib gene (110). a recent study of a murine
model of nephrotoxic nephritis has suggested that ivig
could be effective by both upregulating the expression
of inhibitory fcgamma riib and downregulating the activating
fcgamma riv (111).
the mechanism of ivig protection appears to be independent of both the antibody specificity and the site of
macrophage activation and is likely to represent a general
mechanism for ivig protection in antibody-triggered autoimmune diseases. however, in some models, fcgamma riibdependent effects of ivig are dependent of the presence of
a particular population of macrophages, the “regulatory”
( xxxg524xxx  dependent) macrophages (112).
recently, a role for both activating and inhibitory fcgamma r
in the control of itp has been reported (113). it has been
shown that the transfer of ivig-primed  xxxg1208xxx + dendritic
cells drives the amelioration of itp through the engagement of activating fcgamma r expressed on dendritic cells by
ivig as a first event (113), suggesting that itam-bearing
receptors are also involved in the inhibition of immune
responses.

furthermore, park min et al. (114) have described the
role of small immune complexes and fcgamma riii in negative regulation of  xxxg1141xxx  mediated inflammation which
contributes to therapeutic efficacy of ivig, independent
of fcgamma riib expression. thus, its fcgamma riib and fcgamma riiidependent actions may be complementary.
recently, kaneko et al., have reported that antiinflammatory activity of ivig results from fc sialylation (115).
recombinant sialylated fc fragments of igg could, therefore, be an attractive therapeutic alternative that could help
to overcome the shortage of ivig for several autoimmune
or inflammatory pathologies. moreover, this study suggests that like monoclonal antibodies (mabs), the pattern
of n-glycosylation of the fc of polyclonal immunoglobulins could be engineered in order to optimize ivig efficacy
(116).
the immunoregulatory role of antiidiotypic
antibodies present in ivig
interactions between ivig and idiotypic determinants
of autoantibodies provide the basis for the ability of ivig
to regulate autoreactive b cell clones in vivo. several lines

journal of clinical immunology, vol. 27, no. 3, 2007

 xxxd2207xxx 

of evidence indicate that antibodies in ivig recognize idiotypes of disease-associated and natural autoantibodies,
and antigen receptors on b lymphocytes. intact ivig and
f(ab )2 fragments of ivig neutralize the activity of various autoantibodies and/or inhibit the binding of autoantibodies to their respective autoantigens in vitro. inhibition of autoantibody activity by ivig is observed in the
case of autoantibodies to factor viii, thyroglobulin, dna,
intrinsic factor, peripheral nerve, neutrophil cytoplasmic
antigens, platelet  xxxg1202xxx /iiia, the acetylcholine receptor,
endothelial cells, phospholipids, nephritic factor, and retinal autoantigen-beta (117). reduction in the autoantibody
titer in vivo, is observed in several conditions following ivig therapy (118, 119). presence of antiidiotypes
to disease-associated autoantibodies may explain the efficacy of ivig in myasthenia gravis, lambert–eaton syndrome, and antibody-mediated neuropathies (120, 121).
however, fab-mediated effects are unlikely to be solely
responsible for the effect of ivig.
attenuation of complement-mediated damage
the interaction of ivig with complement prevents the
generation of  xxxg285xxx -9 membrane attack complex and subsequent complement-mediated tissue damage, by scavenging active complement components and diverting complement attack from cellular targets (122). ivig binds the
activated components c3b and  xxxg284xxx  in a c1q-independent
(123) and c1q-dependent (124) fashion, thus preventing
the deposition of these fragments on target surfaces of
complement activation. this action of ivig is relevant
in the treatment of patients with severe dermatomyositis, guillain–barré syndrome, and myasthenia gravis. recently, a f(ab )2 -mediated neutralization of  xxxg282xxx  and c5a
anaphylotoxins has been proposed as an effector function
of ivig (125).
modulation of the production of cytokines
modulation of the production of cytokines and cytokine antagonists by ivig is a major mechanism by
which immunoglobulin exerts its antiinflammatory effects
in vivo (126) in neuromuscular disorders like inflammatory myopathies, demyelinating neuropathies, and myasthenia gravis (120, 127). ivig was shown to selectively
trigger the production of  xxxd172xxx  ( xxxg1172xxx ), the natural antagonist of il-1, in cultures
of purified monocytes, without concomitant effect on the
production of the proinflammatory cytokines il-1alpha,  xxxg1170xxx , il-6, and tnf-alpha (128, 129). circulating levels of
interleukin-1beta in patients with the guillain–barré syndrome decrease after treatment with ivig (130). the antiinflammatory effects of ivig relating to modulation of

journal of clinical immunology, vol. 27, no. 3, 2007

cytokine production are not restricted to monocytic cytokines, but are also largely dependent on the ability of
ivig to modulate th1 and th2 cytokine production (131).
interaction of ivig with membrane molecules of antigen
presenting cells, b and t lymphocytes
besides binding to idiotypes of immunoglobulins, ivig
reacts with a number of membrane molecules of t cells,
b cells, and monocytes, which are relevant to the control
of autoreactivity and induction of tolerance to self. thus,
ivig is shown to contain antibodies to variable and constant regions of the human t-cell receptor (9), cytokines
and cytokine receptors (12, 13), cd5 (10), cd4 (11),
hla class i molecules (14), rgd adhesion motif (17),
the  xxxg371xxx  (132), cd40 (133), and fas
(16). antibodies directed to such functional molecules of
lymphocytes may be important to the immunomodulatory
effect of normal immunoglobulins. ivig inhibits toxic epidermal necrolysis (ten) (lyell’s syndrome) by blocking
the interaction of fas with its natural ligand,  xxxd3135xxx 
(fas l) (16). while fas receptors are normally expressed
in keratinocytes, high levels of soluble  xxxd3135xxx  were
observed in the sera of patients with ten. the observed
beneficial effect of ivig in ten is believed to be due to
the presence of naturally occurring antibodies against fas
in ivig that block fas–fas l interaction (16).
interaction of ivig with dendritic cells
because of their capacity to stimulate naive t cells,
dendritic cells (dc) have a central role in the initiation of
primary immune responses and are considered promising
targets for immunotherapy (134). dendritic cells (dc) are
the primary mediators for the immunosuppressive effect
of ivig on t-cell activation (97, 135). ivig inhibits the differentiation and maturation of dc in vitro, abrogates the
capacity of mature dc to secrete il-12 upon activation,
while enhancing il-10 production. ivig-induced downregulation of costimulatory molecules, associated with
modulation of cytokine secretion results in inhibition of
auto- and alloreactive t-cell activation and proliferation
(135). at “therapeutic” high dose, ivig interferes with the
differentiation of dc in sle patients, along with an inhibition of the expression of hla and  xxxg396xxx / xxxg398xxx  molecules.
ivig-treated immature dc also display reduced ability to
ingest nucleosomes (97). given the critical role of hla
molecules and costimulatory signals delivered by  xxxg396xxx 
and  xxxg398xxx  for optimal antigen presentation and t-cell activation, the inhibition of expression of these molecules
by ivig offers a plausible explanation for the efficacy of
ivig in sle and other immunoinflammatory conditions.

240

contrary to its inhibitory effect on dc with “therapeutic” high dose, ivig exerts an agonistic effect on the differentiation of dc with “replacement” low dose. dc from patients with common variable immunodeficiency (cvid)
show defective differentiation (136). in the presence of
ivig, the dc from cvid patients show upregulation of
 xxxg376xxx  (marker of differentiated dc) and costimulatory
molecules  xxxg396xxx ,  xxxg398xxx , and cd40 (molecules critical
in dc–t-cell cross-talk) as compared to dc in the presence of autologous plasma alone. partial restoration of dc
phenotypes in primary immunodeficiency patients, points
toward the role of ivig in maintaining immune homeostasis, through its interaction with the cellular compartment
(137, 138). thus, ivig replacement therapy is much more
than a mere transfer of antibodies in immunodeficient
patients.

negi

et al.

with activation of complement and the cytokine network,
provision of antiidiotypic antibodies, regulation of cell
growth, and effects on the activation, differentiation, and
effector functions of dc, t and b cells. the therapeutic
effects of ivig in all likelihood reflect the functions of
natural antibodies in maintaining immune homeostasis in
healthy people.
over the past two decades, ivig has become the preferred treatment for guillain–barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and kawasaki
disease. the ability of ivig to interact through complementary v regions of antibodies, antigen receptors, and
relevant soluble and surface molecules, provides the basis
for re-emergence of normal immune repertoire in treated
patients.

effect on remyelination
in addition to the immunomodulating effects, immunoglobulins seem to have a remyelinating potential.
in theiler’s virus-induced murine encephalomyelitis
(tmev), an animal model of ms, myelin protein antibodies, hyperimmune serum, as well as pooled immunoglobulins from donor mice promote and improve remyelination
(139, 140). similar results have been observed in experimental autoimmune neuritis (ean), the animal model of
gbs (141). little is known about the exact mechanism
behind this phenomenon. it is possible that immunoglobulins may, through improved opsonization of myelin and
axons, lead to a limited secondary cellular infiltration and
thus to protection from further injury. removal of myelinassociated inhibitors that are known to be present in central nervous system (cns) and peripheral nervous system
(pns) lesions may, in addition, play a role in this process.
immunoglobulins lead to increased uptake of myelin debris by macrophages in vitro (142). the phagocytosis of
myelin debris by macrophages in demyelinating diseases
may lead to removal of inhibitory factors. it may also lead
to production of growth factors by macrophages, such as
platelet-derived growth factor, ciliary  xxxg1614xxx ,
or insulin growth factor (143). further studies are necessary to investigate the effects of immunoglobulins on
macrophages and the role of this cell in remyelination.
conclusion

considerable progress has been made in understanding
the mechanisms by which ivig exerts immunomodulatory
effects in autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. its
mechanism of action is complex, involving modulation
of expression and function of fc receptors, interference
