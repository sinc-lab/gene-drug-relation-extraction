experimental procedures

as a treatment for dyslipidemia, oral doses of 1–3
grams of  xxxd2715xxx  per day lower serum triglycerides, raise high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and reduce mortality from coronary heart disease (tavintharan, s., and kashyap, m. l. (2001) curr. atheroscler. rep.
3, 74 – 82). these benefits likely result from the ability of
 xxxd2715xxx  to inhibit lipolysis in adipocytes and
thereby reduce serum non-esterified fatty acid levels
(carlson, l. a. (1963) acta med. scand. 173, 719 –722). in
mice,  xxxd2715xxx  inhibits lipolysis via puma-g, a
gi/o-coupled seven- xxxg1608xxx  expressed
in adipocytes and activated macrophages (tunaru, s.,
kero, j., schaub, a., wufka, c., blaukat, a., pfeffer, k.,
and offermanns, s. (2003) nat. med. 9, 352–355). the
human ortholog  xxxg1026xxx  is also a  xxxg1026xxx 
and likely has a similar role in anti-lipolysis. endogenous levels of  xxxd2715xxx  are too low to significantly
impact receptor activity, hence the natural ligands(s) of
 xxxg1026xxx /puma-g remain to be elucidated. here we show
that the fatty acid-derived ketone body (d)-␤-hydroxybutyrate ((d)-␤-ohb) specifically activates puma-g/
 xxxg1026xxx  at concentrations observed in serum during fasting. like  xxxd2715xxx , (d)-␤-ohb inhibits mouse
adipocyte lipolysis in a puma-g-dependent manner and
is thus the first endogenous ligand described for this
orphan receptor. these findings suggests a homeostatic
mechanism for surviving starvation in which (d)-␤-ohb
negatively regulates its own production, thereby preventing ketoacidosis and promoting efficient use of fat
stores.

materials—with the exception of acifran and lithium (dl)-␤-ohb,
all compounds tested were from sigma. acifran was synthesized by
chemists at arena pharmaceuticals, and lithium (dl)-␤-ohb was made
by titrating free (dl)-␤-ohb acid (sigma) with lioh by chemists at
merck. [35s]gtp␥s (1160 ci/mmol) was from amersham biosciences,
and [5,6-3h] xxxd2715xxx  (50 ci/mmol) was from american radiolabeled chemical (st. louis, mo).
molecular cloning— xxxg1026xxx  and  xxxg1027xxx  were cloned by pcr using
human genomic dna as a template and the following primers, gctggagcattcactaggcgag (sense for  xxxg1026xxx ), agatcctggttcttggtgacaatg (antisense for  xxxg1026xxx ), ggagaattcactaggcgaggcgctccatc (sense for  xxxg1027xxx ), and ggaggatccaggaaaccttaggccgagtcc (antisense for  xxxg1027xxx ). puma-g was cloned using
mouse genomic dna as template, the sense primer agatccactcatgagcaagtcagacc, and the antisense primer ccttcttgtcatagtaacttaacgag.
for the generation of stable cell lines, 5 ⫻ 106 cho-k1 cells were
transfected with 12 ␮g of plasmid dna (pcdna3.1, invitrogen) containing either  xxxg1026xxx ,  xxxg1027xxx , or puma-g expressed from the cytomegalovirus promoter. two days after transfection, the growth medium was
supplemented with 400 ␮g/ml  xxxg418xxx  to select for antibiotic-resistant
cells. clonal cho-k1 cell lines that stably express  xxxg1027xxx ,  xxxg1026xxx , or
puma-g were selected based on the ability of  xxxd2715xxx  ( xxxg1026xxx 
and puma-g) or s711589 (an arena  xxxg1027xxx -specific agonist; data not
shown) to inhibit  xxxd1742xxx -induced camp production.

ketone bodies (acetone, acetoacetate (acac),1 and (d)-␤ohb) are produced in the liver from acetyl-coa derived from
␤-oxidation of  xxxd2154xxx  (7). acac and (d)-␤-ohb are small
water-soluble carboxylic acids that are important energy
sources for the brain and other tissues during prolonged fasting
(10). in humans, the serum concentration of (d)-␤-ohb is typically ⬃50 ␮m after a meal, rises to ⬃0.2– 0.4 mm after an
overnight fast, reaches ⬃1–2 mm after 2–3 days of fasting, and
plateaus at ⬃6 – 8 mm upon prolonged starvation (7–9, 11).
␤-ohb infusion into rats (12), pancreatomized dogs (13), and
humans (9, 14) lowers serum nefas in vivo, and ␤-ohb inhibits lipolysis in primary rat (15, 16) or bovine (17) adipocytes,
whereas acac does not. the fact that these effects are similar
to those of  xxxd2715xxx  and that both ␤-ohb and nicotinic
acid are small carboxylic acids led us to investigate whether
ketone bodies are  xxxg1026xxx  agonists.

[gdp] was 10 ␮m) for ⬃10 min before addition of [35s]gtp␥s to 0.3 nm.
to measure the agonist activity of free acids, rather than sodium salts
(table i), the hepes concentration was increased to 60 mm; this
increase had no effect on the ec50 of  xxxd2715xxx  (data not shown).
binding was allowed to proceed for 1 h before centrifuging the plates at
4000 rpm for 15 min at room temperature and subsequent counting in
a packard topcount scintillation counter. non-linear regression analysis of the binding curves was performed in graphpad prism version 4.
[3h] xxxd2715xxx  binding competition assay—assays were performed with the same preparations of membrane used for the
[35s]gtp␥s assay. equilibrium binding of [3h] xxxd2715xxx  was done
with membranes (30 ␮g/assay) and test compounds diluted in assay
buffer (20 mm hepes, ph 7.4, 1 mm mgcl2, and 0.01% chaps) in a
total volume of 200 ␮l. after 4 h at room temperature, reactions were
filtered through packard unifilter gf/c plates using a packard harvester and washed eight times with 200 ␮l of ice-cold binding buffer.
nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 250 ␮m unlabeled  xxxd2715xxx . competitive binding assays were performed in the
presence of 50 nm [3h] xxxd2715xxx .
in vitro lipolysis—isolation of mouse primary epididymal adipocytes and in vitro determination of nefa release was performed according to the method of rodbell as adapted by tunaru et al. (3, 23).

to ask whether ␤-ohb is a ligand for  xxxg1026xxx , we used
chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells that stably express the
chimeric g-protein ␣ subunit gqi5 (18) and harbor either a
control vector or vectors that expresses either  xxxg1026xxx  or its
paralog  xxxg1027xxx , which is 95% identical at the amino acid level to
 xxxg1026xxx  but has ⬃1000-fold less affinity for  xxxd2715xxx  (4, 5).
use of gqi5 allows the normally gi/o-coupled  xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx 
to signal via the gq pathway leading to ca⫹2 mobilization.
 xxxd2715xxx  elicited ca⫹2 mobilization only in cells expressing  xxxg1026xxx  (fig. 1a). in contrast, acifran, an agonist on both
 xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx  (4), elicited a response from both receptors
demonstrating that  xxxg1027xxx  was functional and could be used as
a specificity control in this assay. given that ketone bodies can
reach millimolar concentrations in serum, we tested these compounds at 15 mm. both (d)- and (l)-␤-ohb, but not acetoacetate
or free acetone, elicited a ca⫹2 response in cells expressing
 xxxg1026xxx  but not  xxxg1027xxx . whereas the d-isomer of ␤-ohb is the
sole form encountered in high concentrations physiologically
(7), both d- and l-isomers have been shown to inhibit lipolysis
in vitro (17), consistent with the results shown here. similar
results were observed for cells expressing murine puma-g
(data not shown).
next, we determined the half-maximal concentration (ec50) of
␤-ohb required to stimulate receptor-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange on g␣ using a [35s]gtp␥s binding assay with
membranes prepared from untransfected cho cells or cho cells
stably expressing either mouse puma-g, human  xxxg1026xxx , or
 xxxg1027xxx  (fig. 1b and table i).  xxxd2715xxx  stimulated
[35s]gtp␥s binding only in membranes from cells expressing
 xxxg1026xxx  (ec50 104 ⫾ 5 nm) or the mouse ortholog puma-g
(ec50 ⫽ 43 ⫾ 3 nm), whereas acifran was active on all three
receptors (ec50 ⫽ 1127 ⫾ 59 nm for  xxxg1026xxx , 358 ⫾ 30 nm for
puma-g, and 7039 ⫾ 598 nm for  xxxg1027xxx ). racemic (dl)-␤-ohb
also showed some degree of activity on all receptors; however, it
was more potent on  xxxg1026xxx  (ec50 ⫽ 0.8 ⫾ 0.06 mm) and its
ortholog puma-g (ec50 ⫽ 0.7 ⫾ 0.04 mm) than on  xxxg1027xxx . the
ec50 for the l-enantiomer was ⬃2-fold higher than that of the
physiologically relevant d-enantiomer (table i). both the sodium
and lithium salts of ␤-ohb were active, indicating that the anion
is the active component. moreover, sodium salts of other small
monocarboxylic acids with similar pka values to ␤-ohb (␣-hydroxybutyrate and lactate) were not significantly active in this
assay (table i). at high concentrations, lithium acetoacetate, but
not acetone or lithium chloride, elicited [35s]gtp␥s binding to all
three receptors but not to membranes from untransfected cells,
suggesting that acetoacetate is a weak agonist of these receptors.

subunit gqi5 and either empty vector or vector expressing  xxxg1026xxx  or
 xxxg1027xxx .  xxxd2715xxx  and acifran were tested at 100 ␮m, and acetone,

short-chain  xxxd2154xxx  were recently identified as ligands for
the g-protein-coupled receptor gpr41, which is, like  xxxg1026xxx /
puma-g, expressed in adipocytes (19 –21). given their similarity to ␤-ohb, we determined whether small  xxxd2154xxx  are
ligands for  xxxg1026xxx /puma-g. indeed, a structure-activity relationship was observed for  xxxd2154xxx  of varying chain length

some compounds displayed activity at the highest concentration tested but not over a full dose response from which an ec50 could be
determined. therefore, the ec50 for these compounds is denoted as greater than the highest concentration tested.

 xxxd2154xxx  with ⬎10 carbons were tested  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m only.

(table i), with pentanoic (c5) and hexanoic (c6) acids being the
most active on  xxxg1026xxx  (c5, ec50 ⫽ 402 ⫾ 51 ␮m; c6, ec50 ⫽
451 ⫾ 91 ␮m) and puma-g (c5, ec50 ⫽ 166 ⫾ 33 ␮m; c6, ec50
⫽ 133 ⫾ 15 ␮m).  xxxg1027xxx  has affinity for slightly longer chain
length  xxxd2154xxx , with a peak of activity centered on octanoic
acid (c8, ec50 ⫽ 73 ⫾ 12 ␮m; table i). however, it is unlikely
that these small  xxxd2154xxx  reach sufficient concentrations in
serum to activate these receptors (19), and so their low affinity
for puma-g/ xxxg1026xxx  and  xxxg1027xxx  is probably not physiologically
relevant. consistent with this, while both  xxxg1026xxx /puma-g
and gpr41 have similar chain length preferences, the latter
receptor has at least 10-fold higher affinity for these acids
(table i and ref. 20). we note as well that in another study
racemic (dl)-␤-ohb was not a gpr41 agonist at concentrations
up to 10 mm (20). similarly, another study found “l-oh-butyrate” (the exact molecular structure of which was not described) to be only a very weak (ec50 ⬃5 mm) ligand of human
gpr41 and gpr43, another receptor for short-chain  xxxd2154xxx 
expressed predominantly in leukocytes (19). finally, ␤-ohb
was not an agonist of gpr81 (22), the next most phylogenetically related receptor to  xxxg1026xxx /puma-g (data not shown).
we employed an equilibrium [3h] xxxd2715xxx  binding competition assay to ask whether  xxxd2715xxx  and ␤-ohb compete for the same binding site on the receptor. [3h]nicotinic
acid bound specifically and saturably to membranes from cells
expressing  xxxg1026xxx , but not  xxxg1027xxx  (data not shown), with a
calculated kd of 105 ⫾ 9 nm (data not shown), a value in good
agreement with published results (3, 4). homologous competition with unlabeled  xxxd2715xxx  yielded a ki of 130 ⫾ 14 nm,
similar to the observed kd (fig. 1c). as in the [35s]gtp␥s
binding assay, acac displayed low apparent affinity for
 xxxg1026xxx , but (dl)-␤-ohb bound the receptor with physiologically relevant affinity (ki ⫽ 0.7 ⫾ 0.06 mm; fig. 1c). similar
results were observed for puma-g (ki ⫽ 0.7 mm ⫾ 0.1 mm; data
not shown). taken together, these data show that (d)-␤-ohb is
a  xxxg1026xxx /puma-g agonist and that the serum concentrations
of this ketone body observed as early as 2–3 days into a fast in

humans (7, 8) will result in significant receptor occupancy and
activity.
previous studies with isolated adipocytes from knock-out
mice demonstrated that puma-g mediates the anti-lipolytic
effect of  xxxd2715xxx  (3); we performed analogous experiments
with (d)-␤-ohb. both  xxxd2715xxx  and sodium (d)-␤-ohb
suppressed free fatty acid efflux from  xxxd2401xxx -stimulated
primary adipocytes from wild-type mice, the latter at concentrations consistent with the affinity determined previously (approximate ec50 for (d)-␤-ohb-mediated lipolysis inhibition ⬃2
mm, fig. 2a). this suppression was puma-g-mediated, as
 xxxd2715xxx  and (d)-␤-ohb were without significant effect in
adipocytes from puma-g knock-out mice (fig. 2b). adipocytes
from puma-g knock-out mice were not merely refractory to
lipolysis inhibition per se, as adp inhibited fatty acid efflux
equally well in wild-type and knock-out cells (fig. 2b). the
adenosine analogue phenylisopropyladenosine also inhibited
lipolysis equally well in wild-type and knock-out cells (data not
shown). we note that the rate of both basal and isoproterenolstimulated lipolysis was routinely lower in adipocytes from
knock-out mice compared with those from wild-type animals
(fig. 2b; compare “no stimulation” and “iso”). it is unlikely
that this difference is due to a deficiency of lipid in the knockout adipocytes, as wild-type and knock-out cells had approximately the same overall size as determined by microscopy (data
not shown), and wild-type and knock-out mice had the same
overall fat mass as determined by nmr spectroscopy.2
discussion

in this work we have shown that the ketone body (d)-␤-ohb
specifically binds to and activates the adipocyte-expressed
gpcrs  xxxg1026xxx /puma-g with an affinity that is well within
the range of serum concentrations observed for this metabolite
after ⬃2–3 days of starvation in humans and ⬃1–2 days in
mice (7, 10). the effect of (d)-␤-ohb is, like  xxxd2715xxx ,

lates its own production by decreasing the serum level of fatty
acid precursors available for hepatic ketogenesis. indeed, in a
study of the serum nefa-lowering effect of ␤-ohb infused into
humans, senior and loridan (9) proposed that during starvation ketone bodies exert “a fine regulatory adjustment” of their
own synthesis by inhibiting adipocyte lipolysis. such a mechanism would potentially conserve fat stores during extended
starvation and attenuate excessive formation of ketoacids from
unrestrained lipolysis and ketogenesis. this model implies that
puma-g knock-out mice would experience higher rates of lipolysis and ketogenesis during a fast, as (d)-␤-ohb does not
inhibit lipolysis in the absence of this receptor. in preliminary
experiments, we have not observed significant reproducible
differences between wild-type and puma-g knock-out animals
in rate of body fat depletion or serum levels of nefa or (d)-␤ohb during 24 and 48 h of fasting.3 however, we note that
adipocytes from knock-out animals are refractory to stimulation with  xxxd2401xxx  (fig. 2b), perhaps suggesting a fundamental difference in lipolysis regulation in the knock-out cells
that may compensate for lack of puma-g. studies with inducible knock-outs of puma-g in adult animals may shed light on
this question.
