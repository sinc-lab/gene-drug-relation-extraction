 xxxd2715xxx  (niacin), a vitamin of the b complex, has been
used for almost 50 years as a lipid-lowering drug1,2. the pharmacological effect of  xxxd2715xxx  requires doses that are much
higher than those provided by a normal diet3,4. its primary action is to decrease lipolysis in adipose tissue by inhibiting hormone-sensitive triglyceride lipase5. this anti-lipolytic effect of
 xxxd2715xxx  involves the inhibition of cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (camp) accumulation in adipose tissue6
through a gi-protein-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase7–9.
a g-protein-coupled receptor for  xxxd2715xxx  has been proposed in adipocytes10,11. here, we show that the orphan g-protein-coupled receptor, ‘protein upregulated in macrophages by
interferon-gamma ’ (mouse puma-g, human  xxxg1027xxx )12,13, is highly expressed in adipose tissue and is a  xxxg1026xxx .
binding of  xxxd2715xxx  to puma-g or  xxxg1027xxx  results in a gi-mediated decrease in camp levels. in mice lacking puma-g, the
 xxxd2715xxx –induced decrease in free fatty acid (ffa) and
triglyceride plasma levels was abrogated, indicating that pumag mediates the anti-lipolytic and lipid-lowering effects of  xxxd2715xxx  in vivo. the identification of the  xxxg1026xxx 
may be useful in the development of new drugs to treat dyslipidemia.
based on the finding that specific binding sites of  xxxd2715xxx 
exist on membranes of adipocytes, spleen and macrophages11,14,
we searched for orphan g-protein-coupled receptors expressed
in adipose tissue and cells of the immune system. the mouse orphan receptor puma-g is encoded by an interferon-gamma-inducible
gene and is expressed in various tissues, including macrophages
and spleen13; its human ortholog,  xxxg1027xxx , is highly expressed in
activated neutrophils12,15. we found that both the human and
murine orphan receptors are expressed at high levels in white
and brown adipose tissue (figs.1a–c). expression was also detected in various other tissues, including lung, adrenal gland and
spleen (figs. 1a–c). the coding regions of the genes encoding
puma-g and  xxxg1027xxx  (pumag and  xxxg1027xxx , also known as gpr109)
both of which are single-exon genes, were amplified by pcr
from mouse adipocyte cdna and human genomic dna, respectively, and subcloned into a mammalian expression vector.
to test whether puma-g and  xxxg1027xxx  function as receptors for
 xxxd2715xxx , the two genes were each co-transfected, with
the gene encoding the promiscuous g-protein alpha-subunit galpha15
352

(ref. 16), in chinese hamster ovary (cho)-k1 cells stably expressing a highly sensitive ca2+ reporter consisting of green fluorescent protein fused to aequorin17. upon exposure to
 xxxd2715xxx , we detected a concentration-dependent ca2+
mobilization response in cells expressing puma-g or  xxxg1027xxx 
and galpha15 (figs. 1d and e).  xxxd2715xxx  concentrations for halfmaximal responses (ec50) were about 3 µm for the mouse and
about 1 µm for the human receptor.  xxxd2715xxx  had no effect in untransfected cells (data not shown) or cells transfected
with galpha15 only (fig. 1e). we also used several structural analogs
of  xxxd2715xxx  to test for ca2+ responses in cells expressing
puma-g or  xxxg1027xxx  and galpha15. the rank order of their potencies
(figs. 1d and e; acipimox, ec50 2–5 µm; pyrazine-2-carboxylic
acid, ec50 10 µm; furan-3-carboxylic acid, ec50 > 100 µm) correlated with their reported potencies in fat cells, as measured by
inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or stimulation of guanosine
triphosphate (gtp)-gammas binding11,18.
the cellular effects of  xxxd2715xxx  may be mediated by pertussis toxin–sensitive g-proteins of the gi-family7,19. to assess
whether activation of puma-g and  xxxg1027xxx  by  xxxd2715xxx  induces gi-mediated signaling events, we measured inhibition of
adenylyl cyclase and activation of extracellular signal–regulated
kinase (erk; see supplementary methods online). in cells expressing puma-g or  xxxg1027xxx  with beta2-adrenergic receptor, nicotinic
acid decreased intracellular camp, which was raised by the
beta-adrenergic receptor agonist  xxxd2401xxx , in a concentrationdependent manner (fig. 2a). the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase
by puma-g and  xxxg1027xxx  could be completely blocked by pretreating cells with pertussis toxin (ptx; fig. 2a). activation of erk by
puma-g (fig. 2b) or  xxxg1027xxx  (data not shown) was also sensitive to
ptx.  xxxd2715xxx  had no effects on camp concentrations or
erk phosphorylation in untransfected cells. puma-g or  xxxg1027xxx 
did not mediate  xxxd2715xxx –dependent production of inositol
phosphates (data not shown). thus, puma-g and  xxxg1027xxx  are coupled to gi-type g-proteins. this confirms studies showing that
 xxxd2715xxx –induced anti-lipolytic effects are sensitive to ptx20.
we then performed radioligand binding assays using 3h-labeled  xxxd2715xxx . saturation binding analysis showed that
membranes prepared from hek-293 cells transfected with pumag and  xxxg1027xxx  showed saturable and specific binding (figs. 2c and
d; dissociation constant (kd) was 83.3 nm for puma-g and 55.6
nm for  xxxg1027xxx ). competitive binding assays (fig. 2e) with differnature medicine • volume 9 • number 3 • march 2003

 xxxd2715xxx  acid for puma-g and  xxxg1027xxx , confirm that puma-g and
 xxxg1027xxx  have a role in the pharmacological effect of nicotinic
acid in vivo.
the anti-lipolytic effect of  xxxd2715xxx  is a result of the inhibition of  xxxg1330xxx  in adipocytes. we used
puma-g-deficient mice generated by homologous recombination (fig. 3a and b) to test whether this anti-lipolytic effect is mediated by puma-g. mice homozygous for the targeted allele of
the pumag gene are viable and have no obvious phenotypic abnormalities. the high-affinity binding capacity for  xxxd2715xxx 
was reduced by >75% in adipocyte plasma membranes from
puma-g-deficient mice, compared to membranes from wildtype mice (fig. 3c). in addition, the  xxxd2715xxx –induced inhibition of ffa release from isolated adipocytes was completely
absent from puma-g-deficient fat cells (fig. 3d). this indicates
that the metabolic effects of  xxxd2715xxx  in adipocytes are indeed mediated by puma-g and  xxxg1027xxx .
to study the role of puma-g in the anti-lipolytic and lipidlowering effects of  xxxd2715xxx  in vivo, we compared ffa levels
in wild-type mice and puma-g-deficient mice after 24 h of starvation. wild-type mice had higher basal levels of ffas than did
puma-g-deficient animals. within 15 min, intraperitoneal injection of  xxxd2715xxx  resulted in a strong decrease in plasma

levels of ffas in wild-type mice and mice heterozygous for the
targeted puma-g allele; the effect lasted >1 h (fig. 3e). in contrast, mice lacking puma-g did not show any decrease in ffas
after injection with  xxxd2715xxx . there was a slight increase in
ffas after 15 min, which was also seen in control mice that received only the carrier solution (data not shown). to test
whether puma-g is involved in  xxxd2715xxx –induced decrease
in triglycerides, we administered  xxxd2715xxx  to wild-type
mice and puma-g-deficient mice that were kept on a high-fat
diet for 2 weeks. this treatment resulted in a decrease in triglycerides of about 30% in wild-type animals, but had no effect in
the absence of puma-g (fig. 3f).
our data clearly show that puma-g and  xxxg1027xxx  mediate the
main metabolic effects of  xxxd2715xxx . it is, however, unlikely
that  xxxd2715xxx  is the physiological ligand of puma-g and
 xxxg1027xxx . plasma and serum concentrations of  xxxd2715xxx  are
mainly determined by diet and are in the range of 100–400
nm22,23, a concentration that is hardly able to activate puma-g
and  xxxg1027xxx  (fig. 1d and e). among the receptors most similar to
puma-g and  xxxg1027xxx  are peptide receptors, purinoceptors and receptors that respond to lipids, such as the recently described receptor for 5-oxo-6(e),8(z),11(z),14(z)-eicosatetraenoic acid
(5-oxo-ete)24. 5-oxo-ete has no agonistic activity against
puma-g or  xxxg1027xxx  (data not shown). the orphan receptor
gpr81, which has the highest similarity to puma-g and  xxxg1027xxx 
(44% amino acid identity), is not a receptor for  xxxd2715xxx

(data not shown). the identity and physiological function of the
endogenous ligand of puma-g and  xxxg1027xxx  are not yet clear.
in conclusion, we have identified a receptor for the antidyslipidemic drug  xxxd2715xxx . we have also shown that the
receptor for  xxxd2715xxx  is highly expressed in white and
brown adipose tissue, which is consistent with a role in lipid metabolism. our studies of mice lacking the  xxxg1026xxx 
indicate that it is the main mediator of the anti-lipolytic and
lipid-lowering effects of  xxxd2715xxx  in vivo. the identification
of the  xxxg1026xxx  should encourage further research
into its physiological function and may be helpful in the
development of anti-dyslipidemic drugs.
methods
molecular cloning. pumag and  xxxg1027xxx  were cloned by pcr from white adipose tissue cdna and genomic dna, respectively, using primers flanking
the full-length coding sequence, and were inserted into the vector
pcdna3.1 (invitrogen, carlsbad, california).
northern blot analysis and rt-pcr. total rna (15 µg) from mouse or
human tissues (biocat, heidelberg, germany) was resolved on 1% denaturing agarose gels and transferred onto nylon membranes (amersham
biosciences, piscataway, new jersey). after prehybridization, membranes
were incubated with a cdna probe (whole coding region; specific activity
>1 × 109 cpm/µg) overnight. after washing the membranes, the hybridized
probe was visualized by autoradiography. for rt-pcr, 1 µg of total rna
was reverse transcribed, and pumag cdna was amplified with primers

flanking the full-length coding sequence. a 395-bp fragment of the gene
encoding the  xxxg1979xxx  ribosomal protein was co-amplified as a control.
calcium mobilization. cho-k1 cells stably transfected with a calcium-sensitive bioluminescent fusion protein consisting of aequorin and green fluorescent protein17 were seeded in 96-well plates and transfected with
indicated cdnas or control dna (50 ng/well) using fugene6 reagent
(roche diagnostics, indianapolis, indiana). two days after transfection,
cells were loaded with 5 µm of coelenterazine h (biotium, hayward,
california) in calcium-free hank’s  xxxd2988xxx  (hbss) containing
10 mm hepes (ph 7.4) and incubated for 3.5 h at 37 °c. the buffer was replaced with hbss containing 1.8 mm cacl2, 45 min before experiments.
measurements were taken using a luminometer plate reader (luminoskan
ascent, labsystems helsinki, finland).  xxxd2715xxx  (pyridine-3-carboxylic
acid), pyrazine-2-carboxylic acid and furan-3-carboxylic acid were from
sigma (st. louis, missouri); acipimox (5-methylpyrazine-2-carboxylic acid
4-oxide) was from pharmacia-upjohn (peapack, new jersey).
radioligand binding. equilibrium binding of 3h-labeled  xxxd2715xxx  (50
ci/mmol; american radiolabeled chemicals, st. louis, missouri) was done
using 30 µg of membranes from hek-293 cells expressing puma-g or  xxxg1027xxx 
receptors, in a total volume of 250 µl binding buffer (50 mm tris-hcl (ph
7.4), 2 mm mgcl2 and 0.02% (v/v) chaps). after 4 h of incubation at 25 °c,
unbound and membrane-bound radioactivity were separated by filtration of
the samples through nitrocellulose filters, followed by two washing steps with
4 ml ice-cold binding buffer. nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 200 µm unlabeled  xxxd2715xxx . competitive binding analysis was
done in the presence of 60 nm 3h- xxxd2715xxx . 3h- xxxd2715xxx  binding to
adipocyte membranes was determined using 75 µg of membranes.
generation of puma-g-deficient mice. a 5-kb pumag genomic clone derived from a bacterial artificial clone (genome systems, st. louis, missouri)
was sequenced (genbank accession no. aj300199; see supplementary
methods online). genotyping of the pumag alleles was performed by pcr
using the primers puma-g-sense-1 (5´-tcagatctgactcgtccacc-3´)
and 333-ko (5´-cctcttcgctattacgccagc–3´) for the inactivated allele and the primers puma-g-sense-1 and 333-wt (5´-ccattgcccaggagtccgaac–3´) for the wild-type allele. heterozygous mice were
back-crossed 5 times into the c576bl/6 strain, and homozygous offspring
were obtained by intercrossing pumag+/– mice. animals were housed in a
specified pathogen–free animal facility.
determination of ffa and triglyceride levels. each experiment was conducted with 1–3 mice per group, using wild-type littermates as controls. for
determination of ffa levels, mice were fed with commercial mouse chow
and tap water ad libitum. animals were starved for 24 h before the experiment. anaesthesia was induced with intraperitoneally injected xylazine hydrochloride (3 mg per kg body weight) and ketamine hydrochloride (100
mg per kg body weight). blood samples were taken from the retrobulbar
capillary plexus and a dose of  xxxd2715xxx  at 200 µmol per kg body weight
(150 µl) or an equal volume of carrier (0.9% nacl) was injected intraperitoneally. blood was collected into heparinized tubes and transferred rapidly
onto ice. plasma was separated by centrifugation and plasma ffa levels were
determined by an enzymatic colorimetric method (roche diagnostics). for
in vitro measurements of ffa release from adipocytes, cells were isolated
from epididymal, perirenal and mesenterial fat deposits25. for plasma triglyceride determinations, mice were kept on a high-fat diet and received 20%
sucrose with their drinking water. blood samples were collected at 11 a.m.
before and 2 weeks after treating animals with 2 daily doses of  xxxd2715xxx 
at 200 µmol per kg body weight (150 µl). triglyceride levels were determined by a colorimetric method (sigma). all animal experiments and care
were approved by the local animal care & use committee.
