the pyrimidine  xxxd3434xxx  (tft) inhibits  xxxg2366xxx  (ts) and can be incorporated into the dna. tft, as part of
tas-102, is clinically evaluated in phase ii studies as an oral chemotherapeutic agent.  xxxd2029xxx  is a  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor of the
 xxxg681xxx  receptor (egfr) that is often deregulated
in colorectal cancer. this study investigated molecular mechanisms
underlying the cytotoxic actions of the combination of an
egfr) xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor with tft in colorectal cancer cells
caco2, widr, lovo92, and colo320. drug interactions were examined by the sulforhodamine b assay and subsequent combination
index (ci) analyses, cell cycle effects by facs analysis of  xxxd3027xxx 
iodide stained cells, akt, mapk and egfr phosphorylation and
expression levels by western blotting and ts activity by the ts in
situ assay. all combination schedules were synergistic in wt-egfr
expressing (but with mutated downstream pathways) widr and
lovo92 (ci 0.4–0.8) and very synergistic in caco2 cells (with wtegfr and functional downstream pathways; ci 0.1–0.3), but in
egfr-lacking colo320 cells, no additional activity was found (ci
1.0–1.2). synergism was mostly related to the induction of cell
cycle arrest and an  xxxd2029xxx -mediated inhibition of the prosurvival signaling through akt and mapk that was activated
(phosphorylated) by tft.  xxxd2029xxx  inhibited ts activity in egfrexpressing cell lines, probably due to cell cycle arrest in the g1
phase. ts activity was slightly lower in the combinations, probably
due to cell cycle interference. taken together, the combination of
 xxxd2029xxx  with tft seems to present a potential strategy in the field
of molecular therapeutics. (cancer sci 2010; 101: 440–447)

c

olorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer
death worldwide. the standard therapy consists of  xxxd2134xxx 
and  xxxd2462xxx , which is usually combined with either the
topoisomerase i inhibitor irinotecan or the novel platinum
analog oxaliplatin.(1) addition of the latter compounds substantially increased the median survival. further improvement
of therapy can be expected from drugs bypassing  xxxd2134xxx  resistance. therefore  xxxd2134xxx  prodrugs are currently being investigated, including s-1, uft and  xxxd425xxx .(2) recently, we
and others showed that another fluoropyrimidine, tft, might
be more effective in crc cells to overcome (acquired)  xxxd2134xxx 
and ⁄ or 5-fluoro-2¢-deoxyuridine ( xxxd2117xxx ) resistance.(3,4) tft is
part of the oral fluoropyrimidine formulation tas-102 and
can be activated to its phosphate derivatives. when monophosphorylated, tft can inhibit ts, thereby inhibiting the
synthesis of new pyrimidines.(3) in its triphosphate form, tft
can be incorporated into the dna, causing dna damage.
both events will lead to the induction of cell death. tas-102
is currently being tested in a phase ii clinical trial against
colon and gastric cancer.(3) tas-102 is a promising novel

formulation that also showed pronounced synergism with
irinotecan and oxaliplatin.(5,6)
 xxxg681xxx  receptor (egfr) is overexpressed or
deregulated in many human cancer types, including crc.(7) a
high egfr expression level has been related to a poor prognosis.(8,9) targeting egfr might be a rational approach to treat
crc patients. egfr inhibitors are under investigation, including the egfr-tkis gefitinib and  xxxd2029xxx .  xxxd2029xxx  is a highly
potent reversible inhibitor of the  xxxg2198xxx  domain of
egfr. it is an oral compound that is active against a wide range
of colon cancers in vitro,(10) but its clinical application is mostly
limited to nsclc in which it is active against patients with activating egfr mutations and wild-type  xxxg1285xxx .  xxxd2029xxx  as a
monotherapy has also shown activity in metastatic crc
patients,(11) providing a basis for further studies in phase ii in
combination with chemotherapy. however, a proper analysis of
the mechanism underlying the combination is essential.
although a combination of egfr inhibition with chemotherapeutic regimens may enhance the anticancer response,(12,13) the
interaction might be dependent on schedule and concentration.
the combination of the multitargeted ts inhibitor  xxxd2868xxx 
with  xxxd2029xxx  showed a sequence-dependent synergistic interaction, for example, when cells were pre-exposed to  xxxd2868xxx 
in nsclc cell lines.(14,15) various combination studies with
 xxxd2029xxx  are currently under investigation in advanced and
metastatic crc, including with  xxxd425xxx  and oxaliplatin,
 xxxd425xxx  and irinotecan, but also with bevacizumab and
 xxxd2134xxx ,  xxxd2462xxx , and oxaliplatin.(16–18)
the aim of our study was to investigate whether inhibition of
egfr could enhance the effect of tft against crc cells
in vitro. we used  xxxd2029xxx  as a model tki and investigated
schedule dependency in relation to the phosphorylation levels of
egfr as well as that of the intracellular kinases akt and
mapk. furthermore, we assessed the effect on cell cycle distribution, modulation of ts activity, and the induction of dna
damage to gain insight into the mechanism underlying the
synergistic effect of combination therapy with tft and an
egfr-tki.
materials and methods
cell lines and chemicals. human colon carcinoma cell lines
widr, colo320, lovo92 and caco2 were cultured as monolayers in dmem supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fcs and
20 mm hepes. cells were maintained in a humidified 5% co2
atmosphere at 37c. tft was provided by taiho pharmaceutical co. (tokushima, japan).

drug cytotoxicity assays. drug cytotoxicity was determined
by the srb assay as described previously.(19) in 96-well plates
(greiner bio-one, frickenhausen, germany), 5000 cells ⁄ well
were seeded in 100 ll medium. after 24 h, 100 ll drug containing medium was added to the wells. after 72 h drug exposure, cells were precipitated for 1 h at 4c with 25 ll 50%
trichloroacetic acid and colored with srb (0.4% srb in 1%
acetic acid [w ⁄ v]). the optical density was measured at 540 nm
after reconstitution of the dye in 150 ll 10 mm tris. the ic50
values were estimated from graphs and are given in means ±
sem. for combination experiments, a concentration range
which was fitted according to calcusyn (biosoft, cambridge,
uk) was used with a fixed ratio based on the ic50. cells were
either exposed concurrently to both tft and  xxxd2029xxx  for 72 h
or 24 h pre-incubated with either tft or  xxxd2029xxx , followed by
a 48 h exposure to the combination. the interaction was determined with the multiple drug effect method, in which a ci was
calculated with calcusyn as described previously.(5) this
method is distinct from other methods by the fact that both
‘‘potency’’ and ‘‘shape’’ of dose–effect curves of drugs and
their combinations are taken into account. for calculation of the
ci, only values above a fraction affected of 0.5 were used,
equivalent to 50–100% growth inhibition. per experiment, ci
values at fraction affected 0.5, 0.75, and 0.9 were averaged
according to the guidelines(5) and the mean was used for comparison of separate experiments. a ci <0.9 indicates synergism
and >1.1 antagonism.
facs analysis of cell cycle. cell cycle analysis and cell death
measurement were carried out as described previously.(19) the
time-course of cell cycle changes for various combinations with
tft was determined earlier, showing the most pronounced
changes after 72 h. therefore, we focused on 72 h treatment
with ic50 concentrations of the drugs and drug combinations;
this also enabled the cells to have completed enough cell cycles
(at least three cycles) to determine statistically significant differences. in brief, 100 000 cells were seeded in six-well plates.
cells were trypsinized, resuspended in medium collected from
the matching sample, and centrifuged for 4 min at 1000g. subsequently, cells were stained with pi (0.1 mg ⁄ ml) in the dark
on ice. dna content of the cells was analyzed by facs
(facscan; bd immunocytometry systems, san jose, ca,
usa) with an acquisition of 10 000 events. sub-g1 peak was
used as the indication of cell death induction.

 xxxg2366xxx  in situ activity

inhibition of ts in intact cells was determined by measuring the
conversion of [3h]- xxxd1836xxx  to 3h2o, which is catalyzed by ts as
described previously.(20) briefly, 1.106 cells were seeded and
incubated with the ic50 concentrations of the different drugs and
the simultaneous combination for 22 h. subsequently, [3h] xxxd1836xxx  (final concentration, 1 lm; specific activity 4.9 ci ⁄ mmol)
was added to each sample for 2 h at 37c. blanks consisted of
culture medium only and untreated cells were used as controls.
the reaction was stopped by adding trichloroacetic acid and
unconverted [3h]- xxxd1836xxx  was removed by activated charcoal.

after centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a liquid
scintillation vial and counted.
western blot analysis. cells were seeded in t25 culture flasks
at a density of 1.5.106 cells. after 24 h, cells were exposed to
ic50 concentrations of tft or the various combination schedules (ic50 concentration) as described in the drugs cytotoxicity
assay. after treatment for the indicated time-points in the figures, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 5 mm
edta, 10 mm tris-hcl [ph 7.5], 150 mm nacl, 50 mm bglycerophophate, 1% triton x-100, 0.04% protease inhibitor
cocktail, 0.1% 1 m navo3) and centrifuged at 11 000g at 4c
for 10 min. protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by carrying out a bio-rad protein assay according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (bio-rad laboratories, veenendaal,
the netherlands). from each condition 30 lg of protein was separated on a 10–12% sds–page and electroblotted onto a
pvdf membrane. blots were blocked in 5% milk in tbst
(0.15 m nacl, 0.05% tween-20, 10 mm tris–hcl [ph 8.0])
and subsequently incubated at 4c overnight with the following
antibodies: egfr (#2232); phospho-egfr (tyr1068 #2234);
akt (#9272); phospho-akt (ser473 #9271); p42 ⁄ 44 mapk
(#9102); phospho-p42 ⁄ 44 mapk (thr202 ⁄ tyr204 #9101)
(1 : 1000; cell signaling technology, danvers, ma, usa); p53
(ab-2; oncogene research products, cambridge, ma, usa);
p21 (santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca, usa); or
phospho-c- xxxg1009xxx  (ser139 #05-636) (1 : 1000; upstate, billerica, ma, usa) and b-actin (#a5441) (1:10,000; sigma aldrich
chemicals, deisenhofer, germany) served as the loading control
for protein amount. after the first antibody, secondary antibody
was added and the signal was detected using ecl or eclplus on hyperfilms (amersham international, chalfont st giles,
uk).
results
growth inhibition and combination analysis. widr, colo320,
and lovo92 cells showed comparable levels of sensitivity to
tft treatment as determined by the srb assay (table 1;
fig. 1). cells were slightly more sensitive to tft than to  xxxd2029xxx . there was barely any difference in sensitivity to  xxxd2029xxx  in
the three cell lines, which were all relatively insensitive with
each ic50 in the lm range. this is probably because they have a
different mutation status for several kinases, including egfr
(table 1). furthermore, they have different expression levels of
p53 and p21 (fig. 2). in widr cells, all combinations were synergistic. all combinations in lovo92 cells were moderately synergistic, although at lower concentration ranges (growth
inhibition <50%) the combinations were not synergistic (fig. 1).
however, we do not consider this low concentration range of
therapeutic interest. in colo320 cells the tested combinations
were not synergistic, although antagonism was not observed. in
contrast to previous experiences with  xxxd2029xxx  combined with a
ts inhibitor,(14,15) the order of administration of the combination schedule was not important to achieve synergism.
in order to determine whether the sensitivity to  xxxd2029xxx  is
important for synergism with tft, we included caco2, a cell

line that is very sensitive to  xxxd2029xxx  (fig. 1) due to a wild-type
egfr expression and with no reported mutations in the genes
of p53, braf,  xxxg1285xxx , or pten. in addition, egfr expression
levels were higher in caco2 than in widr cells.(21) caco2 cells
were sensitive to  xxxd2029xxx  with an ic50 value in the nm range
(table 1; fig. 1). in these cells, all three combination schedules
were highly synergistic (fig. 1).
effects on cell cycle distribution. to determine whether the
synergistic actions were related to specific cell cycle effects,
facs analysis of pi stained cells was carried out using ic50
concentrations (table 1; fig. 3; fig. s1, supporting information). tft alone induced predominantly a g2 ⁄ m-phase arrest,
although this was cell line- and time-dependent. in widr and
lovo92,  xxxd2029xxx  alone increased cells in the g1-phase, which
was not time-dependent. in contrast, in colo320 cells,  xxxd2029xxx 
caused no significant changes in the cell cycle distribution. the
simultaneous exposure increased widr cells in the g1 phase to
some extent. when preincubated with  xxxd2029xxx , the combined
treatment resulted in an increased s phase fraction. in lovo92
cells, all drug combinations induced g1 phase arrest. in addition,
in both widr and lovo92 cells, the cell cycle distribution seen
after combined drug treatments is more comparable to that of
 xxxd2029xxx  alone than to that of tft alone. when colo320 cells
were preincubated with  xxxd2029xxx  prior to addition of the combination, cells mostly accumulated in the s phase, whereas the
other two combinations arrested cells mainly in the g2 ⁄ m phase,
comparable to tft alone. because of the different cell cycle
distribution in the pre- xxxd2029xxx  schedule,  xxxd2029xxx  may have offtarget effects. in colo320 cells the combinations were not synergistic. these different effects on cell cycle distribution between

(e ﬁ t + e; -s-). sem was less than 20%. a mean
combination index (ci) was calculated at fraction
affected of 0.5, 0.75, and 0.9 and values are
indicated in the graphs for each combination. ci
values represent means of at least four
independent experiments.

the various cell lines indicate that the interactions between the
drugs are cell cycle mediated.
effects on cell death induction. to determine whether the
combinations resulted in an increase in cell death induction, we
analyzed the sub-g1-fraction of pi stained cells. in order to
determine apoptosis we also determined caspase activation,
which might not be seen in the sub-g1. the pattern of sub-g1
accumulation agreed with caspase activation (data not shown).
in all three cell lines, tft induced cell death in a time-dependent manner (fig. 4).  xxxd2029xxx  did not induce cell death
directly. in widr, cell death was induced more strongly by the
combinations compared to the control, although the combinations did not have a higher cell death than induced by 72 h tft
alone. in lovo92 and colo320 cells, cell death induced by the
combination where tft was given first was significantly higher
than control levels, although lower than induced by tft alone.
as the combinations in egfr expressing cells were synergistic,
this may indicate that the combinations act by the induction of
cell cycle arrest rather than cell death.
 xxxg2366xxx  activity.  xxxg2366xxx  is an
important cell cycle enzyme that plays a limiting role in de novo
pyrimidine deoxynucleotide synthesis. as the cell cycle effects
seem to be important for the synergistic action of the combinations, and ts is one of the targets of tft, we determined ts
inhibition in intact cells treated with tft and  xxxd2029xxx 
(table 2). based on previous time-course experiments with ts
inhibitors in these cell lines, we chose 24 h to measure the inhibition.(22) tft markedly inhibited ts activity in all three cell
lines.  xxxd2029xxx  alone also inhibited ts activity in egfr
expressing widr and lovo92 cells. after a simultaneous combination, ts was inhibited to a larger extent than by tft alone.
this level of inhibition was almost similar to the expected level
of inhibition, although the decrease was not significant
(table 2). the effect of  xxxd2029xxx  alone on ts might be related
to a cell cycle-dependent activity of ts.(15,23)
effects on egfr, mapk and akt phosphorylation.  xxxd2029xxx 
inhibits egfr phosphorylation and thereby its downstream targets, akt and mapk. to determine whether cell cycle arrest
was related to inhibition of these important cell growth signalling pathways, western blot analysis was carried out. lovo92
strongly expressed egfr, widr had a moderate egfr expression, but colo320 did not express egfr (fig. 2).

as effects on phosphorylation are direct, the phosphorylation
status of these proteins was determined after 2 h exposure of the
drugs and simultaneous drug combination (fig. 5). moreover, to
determine whether  xxxd2029xxx  can effectively inhibit egfr, egf
was added to the cultures 5 min prior to cell lysis. in this way, it
can be determined whether the egfr signalling pathway was
inhibited. in widr and lovo92 cells, egfr, akt, and mapk
phosphorylation increased after egf stimulation. tft slightly
increased the phosphorylation levels of mapk.  xxxd2029xxx  alone
increased egfr phosphorylation, but prevented the stimulation
by egf.  xxxd2029xxx  clearly prevented activation of the downstream kinase akt and to a lesser extent that of mapk. in the
combination, phosphorylation of egfr and akt were inhibited
almost completely, whereas the stimulation of mapk by egf
and tft was completely prevented. in colo320 cells, egfr,
akt, and mapk phosphorylation levels did not change after
stimulation with egf. egfr was not detectable and could not
be upregulated to a detectable level by any of the tested drugs or

drug combinations. akt phosphorylation was slightly decreased
after tft alone. these results indicate that  xxxd2029xxx  can inhibit
egfr signalling in cells with an active egfr, but has no effect
on downstream signaling in cells with low or absent egfr
expression.
in order to investigate long-term effects, and the effects in the
sequential combinations, which can not be determined after 2 h
and in which egf addition does not play a role (data not
shown), we also investigated the effects of the combination after
72 h (fig. 6). surprisingly, in widr and lovo92 cells, after
48 h of tft exposure phosphorylated egfr increased, which
was reduced after 72 h. in both widr and lovo92 cells tft
increased phosphorylation levels of mapk and akt time-dependently.  xxxd2029xxx  barely affected akt phosphorylation, but in
widr cells, phosphorylated akt increased after 24 h, which
reduced in time.
in widr and lovo92, addition of  xxxd2029xxx  prevented the prosurvival signalling that was induced by tft, even to lower levels than the control phosphorylation levels. although after the
sequential combination where tft was given first, akt and
mapk were still activated, this was reduced to control levels. in
colo320 cells, which did not express detectable egfr or phosphorylated mapk, no changes in expression and ⁄ or phosphorylation levels were observed after all different drugs and drug
combinations. overall, the inhibition of cell growth can be
related to cell cycle effects, which in turn are related to the inhibition of the pro-survival signals that are induced by tft.
effect on dna damage. recent reports have indicated that
egfr inhibition might decrease dna repair activity,(24,25)
therefore we determined the level of dna damage after 72 h of
drug incubation and whether dna damage levels decreased
(due to repair) after 48 h of growth in drug-free medium
(fig. 7). dna damage was monitored by determination of the
phosphorylation status of histone c– xxxg1009xxx , one of the first
events in dna damage response. cells exposed to the drugs or
drug combinations induced c- xxxg1009xxx  phosphorylation, although
for the combinations a less than additive effect was seen. in
lovo92 and widr cells, this dna damage increased significantly (up to 55-fold) following subsequent 48 h of culture in
drug-free medium. in colo320 cells this accumulation did not
increase, but may explain the observed cell cycle changes after
exposure to the combination.

discussion

this study shows that a combination of tft with  xxxd2029xxx  is
synergistic in egfr expressing colon cancer cells, also in the
presence of a  xxxg1285xxx  mutation. this sensitization of moderately
sensitive cells to  xxxd2029xxx  indicates the potential for evaluating
the combination of tft with egfr-tkis. ongoing clinical
studies are confirming the promising therapeutic activity of
second-generation egfr-tkis and multitargeted tkis in
several tumor types.(26,27) the combination of tft with  xxxd2029xxx  was strongly synergistic in caco-2 cells with a functional
(e.g. wild-type) egfr signaling pathway, and the combination
was synergistic in widr and lovo92 cells that were moderately
sensitive to  xxxd2029xxx  with mutations in the downstream egfr
pathway. the combination was not synergistic in cells that did
not express egfr. this underlines the importance of an active
egfr signaling pathway in the synergistic interaction. the
mechanism underlying the synergistic interaction was probably
due to inhibition of the downstream egfr pro-survival signaling pathway and the induction of dna damage.
synergistic actions with egfr-tkis have previously been
reported with cytotoxic agents such as  xxxd2134xxx  and ts inhibitors
( xxxd2868xxx ) and irinotecan, and with radiation.(15,28–30) these
cytotoxic agents and radiation could increase the phosphorylation
level of egfr, which possibly reflects the activation of
pro-survival signaling. this effect was blocked by addition of

egfr-tkis, explaining the synergistic activities.  xxxd2134xxx  or
 xxxd2868xxx -induced activation of egfr phosphorylation was
prevented by gefitinib and  xxxd2029xxx .(15,31) in our study, such a
synergistic interaction was only found for cells that constitutively expressed both egfr and activated the pro-survival signaling after exposure to tft. tft alone activated egfr
phosphorylation levels, and highly increased the phosphorylation levels of the pro-survival kinases mapk and akt. this
pro-survival signaling could be inhibited by the addition of  xxxd2029xxx , possibly explaining the synergistic interaction. in egfr
lacking colo320 cells,  xxxd2029xxx  could inhibit cell growth and
no synergism was found. in these cells tft hardly activated
pro-survival signaling and  xxxd2029xxx  did not have any effect on
the phosphorylation levels of the tested intracellular kinases or
on the cell cycle. therefore, it is likely that the mechanism of
 xxxd2029xxx  in these cells do not involve changes in intracellular
signaling in the examined routes.
all three cell lines were moderately sensitive to  xxxd2029xxx . in
nsclc and crc, mutations in  xxxg1285xxx  and braf are potential biomarkers for  xxxd2029xxx  sensitivity. mutations in these genes can
cause constitutive activation of mapk. the low egfr expression in one cell line and  xxxg1285xxx  mutations may explain the low
sensitivity to  xxxd2029xxx . however, independent of the mutations in
 xxxg1285xxx , downstream signaling of akt and mapk was significantly
inhibited in our cell lines. in addition, egfr status is known not
to be a predictive factor for responses to cetuximab, as responses
were reported in patients with egfr-negative tumors.(32,33) in
addition,  xxxd2029xxx  has shown to have some off-target effects in
leukemia cells, in which the jak2 ⁄  xxxg2216xxx  pathway was inhibited,(34) and which were likely to be comparable to the off-target
effects of gefitinib.(35) in the latter studies, differentiation and
cell cycle blockade induced by egfr antagonists exerting offtarget effects on acute myeloid leukemia (aml) cells were not
automatically linked to an apoptotic response.(34,35) our data
indicate that  xxxd2029xxx  also has off-target effects in colon cancer
bijnsdorp et al.

cells. ongoing clinical studies, in which the responses to the
new-generation egfr-tkis are evaluated, appear to be promising. in this respect, based on our current data, the inhibition of
pro-survival signaling by egfr-tkis can enhance the efficacy
of the chemotherapeutic agent and may be worthwhile to test in a
clinical setting.
recent studies reported that ergf-tkis can decrease the
expression levels and activity of ts in nsclc, breast, and colorectal cancer cells(15,23,36) and could be related to synergism. as
 xxxd2029xxx  did not inhibit ts itself in cell-free extracts,(15) the
decrease in ts can be explained by the g1 ⁄ g0 cell cycle arrest
that was induced by the egfr-tki. ts is an enzyme that is
only active in the s phase of the cell cycle. ts activity was
decreased in the combinations, compared to tft alone, which is
possibly related to an increased inhibition of ts and the induced
cell cycle arrest.(15)
 xxxg681xxx  receptor inhibitors have been shown
to stimulate the induction of apoptosis in various cell
types.(15,31) however, in our colon cancer cell line panel,  xxxd2029xxx  itself did not induce cell death, as shown by the sub-g1 analysis. the lack of cell death is supported by the absence of
caspase activation following  xxxd2029xxx  treatment.  xxxd2029xxx  seems
to act more on the cell cycle, arresting cells in the g0 ⁄ g1 phase,
which can be mediated by inhibition of pro-survival signaling.
as cell death was not involved in the synergistic actions, it is
expected that the action of the combinations is more related to
an induction of cell cycle arrest, possibly mediated by the induction of dna damage. previously it was reported that cell cycle
modulation is important for the efficacy of the combination
of egfr-tkis with cytotoxic agents.(15,37) cellular damage
induced by chemotherapeutic compounds can convert egfr
ligands from growth factors into survival factors for cancer cells
that express functional egfr.(38) in this context, the blockade
of egfr signaling by egfr-tki could prevent repair of cellular damage induced by cytotoxic drugs.
inhibition of egfr signaling has previously been shown to
reduce dna damage repair.(39) tft is a known inducer of dna
damage,(5,6) therefore the combined treatment with  xxxd2029xxx 
might cause persistent dna damage induction, for example,
tft-induced dna damage can not be repaired due to inhibition
of the dna repair mechanisms by  xxxd2029xxx .(39) this notion is
further strengthened by the finding that persistent dna damage
was only observed in egfr expressing cells. this may also
explain why  xxxd2029xxx  alone induced dna damage, as it also
affects basal repair levels. thus, the synergism found between
tft and  xxxd2029xxx  might be explained by a diminished ability to
repair tft-induced dna damage lesions.
 xxxg2365xxx  plays a role in apoptosis, cell
growth, and angiogenesis.(40) moreover, tp might be induced
after exposure to egfr-tkis and cytotoxic agents, which has
been related to chemoresistance.(23) tas-102 consists of tft
combined with  xxxg2365xxx  inhibitor.(3) this may
be an additional advantage of a clinical combination of tas102 with  xxxd2029xxx . further investigation is required to elucidate
the role of tp in enhancement of responses to egfr-tki, especially in vivo. in conclusion, the combination of tft with
egfr-tki was synergistic, which was dependent on egfr
expression and probably mediated by cell cycle deregulation
and not immediate cell death. although further research is
needed to fully elucidate this promising combination in crc
therapy, the concept of combined molecular targeting of egfr
and tft seems to present a potential strategy in the field of
molecular therapeutics.
