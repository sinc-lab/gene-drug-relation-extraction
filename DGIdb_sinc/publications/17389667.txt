antiarrhythmic effects by blocking potassium, calcium, and
sodium channels. additionally, it has antiadrenergic (alpha-and
beta-blocking) properties.  xxxd1944xxx  is also a potent coronary vasodilator in the hearts of rabbits, guinea pigs, and rats
via  xxxd2738xxx  synthase– and  xxxg1587xxx –mediated effects.3,4
 xxxd1944xxx ’s effects on the action potential and surface electrocardiogram have been examined in both animal
and human models. the drug prolonged the action potential in normal rat hearts but showed minimal effects on the
action potential in rats after a myocardial infarction.5 in
rabbit studies,  xxxd1944xxx  produced pronounced rr, qt,
and qtc interval prolongation.6,7  xxxd1944xxx  and amiodarone, at comparable doses, showed similar electrophysiological effects, including sinus cycle length, atrium–his
bundle interval, and atrioventricular node and ventricular
effective refractory periods in canine hearts.8
in human studies,  xxxd1944xxx  caused dose-dependent
lengthening of the pr interval with 13.4, 16.6, and 28.4
msec at 800, 1200, and 1600 mg/day, respectively.9 the
proportion of patients experiencing qtc interval of greater
than 500 msec also increased with dose. the occurrence of
a single episode of qtc interval lengthening of greater
than 500 msec was 7.7%, 6.6%, 9.1%, and 16.4% with
placebo and  xxxd1944xxx  800, 1200, and 1600 mg/day. increases in the qtc interval were most pronounced at the
highest dose (1600 mg/day), with an average prolongation
of 39 msec (p = 0.0024 vs placebo). the effects of  xxxd1944xxx  on the qtc interval and proarrhythmic risk are discussed in more detail in the adverse reactions section.
 xxxd1944xxx  also exhibits hemodynamic effects.
 xxxd1944xxx  and amiodarone demonstrated similar inhibition of alpha-adrenergic receptors when studied in anesthetized dogs pretreated with atropine. furthermore,
 xxxd1944xxx  inhibited  xxxd2398xxx -induced tachycardia,
but to a lesser extent than amiodarone.10
pharmacokinetics
 xxxd1944xxx  has an oral bioavailability of 15–20%,
which is increased 2- to 3-fold when taken with food.2 it
undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism and is metabolized by cyp3a4.  xxxd1944xxx ’s elimination half-life is
24 hours. it is excreted in the feces; neither the parent compound nor its metabolites are excreted in the urine. when
dosed twice daily,  xxxd1944xxx  achieves steady-state concentrations in 5–7 days.

were warranted (table 1).9 patients with lone atrial fibrillation or atrial fibrillation secondary to ischemic heart disease, hypertension, or dilated cardiomyopathy were eligible for inclusion. patients were randomized to receive
placebo or  xxxd1944xxx  and were followed for a minimum
of 180 days. the primary endpoint was time to first documented atrial fibrillation episode. secondary endpoints included spontaneous conversion of atrial fibrillation, heart
rate in atrial fibrillation, and occurrence of adverse events.
average age ranged from 62 to 65 years between the
groups; 44 –56% of patients had hypertension, 18–27%
had coronary artery disease, and 11–22% had heart failure.
there was a statistically significant increase in the median time to atrial fibrillation recurrence in the  xxxd1944xxx 
800 mg/day group compared with placebo (relative risk
0.45; 95% ci 0.28 to 0.72). there was no significant difference in the time to recurrence of atrial fibrillation between the placebo and  xxxd1944xxx  1200 or 1600 mg
groups. patients in the higher-dose groups experienced
more adverse events than those in the 800 mg/day group.
these patients were also more likely to discontinue study
drug treatment. this may have had a negative effect on the
efficacy analysis of these groups and could help to explain
the nonsignificant results. the dafne trial found a dosedependent increase in spontaneous conversion of atrial fibrillation, as well as a ventricular response rate reduction
among patients remaining in atrial fibrillation. adverse
events leading to study withdrawal appeared to be dose related. the most common reason for study withdrawal was
gastrointestinal adverse effects including diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and gastroenteritis (table 2).9
while  xxxd1944xxx  provided a statistically and clinically
significant increase in the time until atrial fibrillation recurrence at the 800 mg/day dose, the overall recurrence rate
was relatively high. at 6 months, only 35% of patients in
the  xxxd1944xxx  800 mg group were in nsr compared
with 10% of placebo-treated patients.9 two similarly designed trials11,12 with other antiarrhythmic agents found that
19–28% of placebo-treated patients remained in nsr for
at least 6 months after cardioversion. major limitations of
dafne include the investigators’ inability to fully explain
the lack of a dose-related response to  xxxd1944xxx  or the
relatively high recurrence of atrial fibrillation. it remains
unknown whether these findings were due to chance or a
trial design issue, possibly limiting the external validity of
the results.9
the euridis (european trial in atrial fibrillation or
flutter patients receiving  xxxd1944xxx  for the maintenance of sinus rhythm) and adonis (american–australian trial with  xxxd1944xxx  in atrial fibrillation or
flutter patients for the maintenance of sinus rhythm) trials were similarly designed. both trials enrolled patients
with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or flutter with at least
one documented episode in the 3 months prior to enroll-

ment (table 1).13-15 the population was similar to that of
the dafne trial, with the exception that these patients
were in nsr at the time of enrollment. more than 1200
patients were randomized in these studies to receive
 xxxd1944xxx  400 mg twice daily or placebo between the 2
studies and were followed for one year. mean age was 63
years in one study and 64 years in the other. the primary
outcome was time to first atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter
recurrence in both trials. secondary endpoints in both studies included mean heart rate in atrial fibrillation or flutter
and occurrence of adverse drug events.
both trials found a significant increase in median time
to relapse and significant reduction in mean heart rate during the first recurrence of atrial fibrillation with  xxxd1944xxx  compared with placebo. a combined analysis of
the euridis and adonis trials did not show a significant difference in mortality in the patients receiving
 xxxd1944xxx  or placebo (table 1). no cases of torsade de
pointes or thyroid or lung dysfunction were observed
during either of these trials. there was a statistically significant increase in the overall incidence of adverse events (p

value not reported) (table 2). while euridis and adonis
demonstrated that  xxxd1944xxx  is safe and effective for the
maintenance of nsr in patients with a history of atrial fibrillation or flutter, interpretation of these results is limited
by the minimal amount of data available until full results
of the trials are published. it is not possible to fully assess
the baseline risk of patients in either the  xxxd1944xxx  or
placebo group. additionally, with the relative risk of atrial
fibrillation recurrence reported, one cannot determine
whether the study population is comparable with the general population. while the safety data from these trials are
encouraging, the duration of follow-up may be inadequate
to observe long-term adverse effects such as pulmonary
and thyroid toxicity, and the trials were not powered to assess mortality.13-15

the trial termination revealed that mortality risk was similar between the groups (table 2).
the ongoing athena (placebo-controlled, doubleblind, parallel arm trial to assess the efficacy of
 xxxd1944xxx  400 mg bid for the prevention of cardiovascular hospitalization or death from any cause in patients with
atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter) was designed to evaluate the
effect of  xxxd1944xxx  on mortality.18 athena will enroll atrisk patients with a history of atrial fibrillation who have been
in nsr for a minimum of one hour. goal enrollment is 3700
patients. subjects will be randomized to receive  xxxd1944xxx 
400 mg twice daily or matched placebo and followed for one
year. the primary endpoint is time to death or cardiovascular-related hospitalization. secondary endpoints include allcause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascularrelated hospitalizations.

achieved adequate rate control with standard therapy
(table 1).16 this population was at higher risk than those of
the dafne, euridis, and adonis trials, as they had
failed treatment with other antiarrhythmic agents. patients
were randomized to receive  xxxd1944xxx  or placebo twice
daily and were followed for 14 days. measure outcomes included the changes in resting heart rate and maximal exercise
heart rate. the investigators found a statistically significant
decrease in both resting and exercise heart rate in the
 xxxd1944xxx  treatment group. the largest limitation of this
study was that the observed benefits could not be correlated
with any clinical outcomes (ie, exercise tolerance, gas exchange parameters, or symptom scores). further research is
needed to evaluate the clinical relevance of the changes in
resting and exercise heart rate with  xxxd1944xxx  therapy.

other potential indications

morbidity and mortality

andromeda (antiarrhythmic trial with  xxxd1944xxx  in moderate-to-severe congestive heart failure
evaluating morbidity decrease) was designed to evaluate
the effect of  xxxd1944xxx  on morbidity in patients with
high-risk heart failure (table 1).17 patients enrolled in the
trial had left ventricular ejection fraction less than 35%.
the investigators intended to enroll 1000 patients, but the
study was prematurely terminated after only 627 patients
were enrolled due to an increase in mortality. mean duration of follow-up ± sd at the time of study cessation was
70.4 ± 43.9 days. worsening of heart failure was the primary cause of death in 40% of the patients in the
 xxxd1944xxx  group and 17% of the patients in the placebo
group. additional follow-up data collected 6 months after

findings from animal trials suggest that  xxxd1944xxx 
may also be an effective therapy for ventricular arrhythmias. administration of intravenous  xxxd1944xxx  1.25, 2.5,
and 5 mg/kg to anesthetized pigs after 30 minutes of left
coronary descending artery occlusion resulted in a significant reduction in the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias
compared with placebo.19 when  xxxd1944xxx  10 mg/kg
was administered to rats during both ischemia and reperfusion, there was a 50% reduction in the occurrence of ventricular tachycardias.20 one small (n = 76) dose-ranging
trial in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
devices (icds) found that  xxxd1944xxx  was safe at doses
of up to 2000 mg and did not cause deterioration of icd
function or alter defibrillation threshold.21

 xxxd1944xxx  for atrial arrhythmias

adverse reactions
the most common adverse effects of  xxxd1944xxx  are
gastrointestinal and include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.2 serious adverse events and study withdrawals were
dose related.2,21 although no pulmonary toxicity has occurred to date in humans, some pulmonary effects have
been observed in animal studies. in vitro,  xxxd1944xxx  was
found to cause more damage to alveolar macrophages than
amiodarone in rabbits.22  xxxd1944xxx  30 mg/kg/day did not
alter triiodothyronine, thyroxine, or  xxxd3368xxx  levels in a 2 week study in rats.23 however,  xxxd1944xxx  was associated with hypothyroid-like effects in another rat study.24 these effects are thought to have resulted
from selective inhibition of the thyroid receptor alpha-1.
 xxxd1944xxx , like all class iii antiarrhythmic agents,
causes qtc interval prolongation, which is associated with
an increased risk of torsade de pointes.  xxxd1944xxx ’s predecessor, amiodarone, has the lowest risk of torsade de
pointes among class iii agents. it is theorized that this is
due to the lesser extent of transmural dispersion of repolarization that occurs with amiodarone. differences in dispersion of repolarization and risk of torsade de pointes were
examined in a recent canine trial.  xxxd1944xxx  caused significant dispersion of repolarization compared with amiodarone.25 consequently,  xxxd1944xxx  was associated with
several canine episodes of torsade de pointes.
based on the results of the andromeda trial,  xxxd1944xxx  would not be used in patients with advanced heart
failure due to a potential risk of increased mortality.17 both
amiodarone and dofetilide have been proven to be safe in
this population in previous trials and should be used preferentially.26 based on the limited information available,
there does not appear to be an increased risk of mortality in
patients without heart failure using  xxxd1944xxx . further
trials designed to assess the mortality effects of  xxxd1944xxx  in other populations are warranted.
drug–drug interactions
although data are lacking,  xxxd1944xxx  is a cyp3a4
substrate and therefore should theoretically be used with
caution with cyp3a4 inhibitors.27  xxxd1944xxx  is also a
cyp2d6 inhibitor and caused a modest increase in metoprolol bioavailability in extensive metabolizers of
cyp2d6. until further drug– drug interaction data are
available, it is prudent to use caution when concurrently
administering  xxxd1944xxx  with cyp2d6 substrates.
dosing
based on the information from current clinical trials,
 xxxd1944xxx  should be dosed at 400 mg twice daily. according to another review,28 no dose adjustments need to
be made based on age, sex, or kidney function. when exwww.theannals.com

amining the available clinical trial data, it is difficult to substantiate this statement. extent of exposure to  xxxd1944xxx 
increased by only 23–33% in elderly men compared with
younger men17; however, one small study17 found that the
extent of exposure was 1.5-fold greater in elderly women
than in elderly men.17 based on this information, no dose
adjustments should be required in elderly men, but further
research is needed to determine whether dose adjustments
are required in elderly women. only 6% of  xxxd1944xxx  is
excreted renally; however, no trials have been conducted
to assess  xxxd1944xxx ’s safety in patients with kidney dysfunction.2,13
place in therapy
the american college of cardiology, american heart
association, and european society of cardiology have
provided guidance as to the agents of choice for patients
with and without structural heart disease.29 since  xxxd1944xxx  may increase mortality in patients with heart failure
and has not been extensively studied in other populations
with structural heart disease, its use should likely be relegated to the treatment of atrial fibrillation in patients without structural heart disease until the results of the
athena study are available. in patients with heart failure, amiodarone and dofetilide are first-line therapies because they have been specifically studied and do not negatively impact mortality.
in coronary artery disease, dofetilide, sotalol, and amiodarone have been shown not to negatively impact mortality. dofetilide and sotalol are first-line agents in this population; amiodarone is a second-line agent due mostly to its
adverse effect profile.29 given the numerous other antiarrhythmic agents available to treat patients with structural
heart disease, there is no need to use  xxxd1944xxx  in this
population unless its safety can be demonstrated.
in patients without structural heart disease,  xxxd2113xxx ,
propafenone, and sotalol are considered first-line agents.29
amiodarone and dofetilide are second-line therapies in this
population due to their drug interaction potential and the
risk of adverse effects. amiodarone blocks multiple cyp
enzymes and the p-glycoprotein pump, while dofetilide is
a substrate for the cation tubular secretion pump and interacts
with numerous pump inhibitors.12 while amiodarone has a
lower risk of torsade de pointes than other currently available
class iii antiarrhythmic drugs, it can cause numerous adverse
effects such as pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic toxicity, hypoand hyperthyroidism, and blue-gray skin discoloration. like
 xxxd2113xxx , propafenone, sotalol, and dofetilide,  xxxd1944xxx 
may have advantages over amiodarone since it has not been
associated with pulmonary or thyroid toxicity.
more work needs to be done to determine the extent of
drug interactions with cyp2d6 substrates and cyp3a4
inhibitors to determine whether there is a pharmacokinetic

advantage with use of  xxxd1944xxx  over amiodarone or
dofetilide.12 without comparative efficacy data versus  xxxd2113xxx , propafenone, and sotalol, it is unlikely that  xxxd1944xxx  would become a first-line therapy for this population at this time, but it would make an acceptable secondline therapeutic choice. although it has the pharmacologic
advantage of blocking both ikr and iks potassium channels, its risk of producing torsade de pointes is likely higher than that of amiodarone and cannot be assumed to be
lower than agents such as sotalol and dofetilide until more
data are available.
summary
 xxxd1944xxx  is an investigational amiodarone analog
that has been studied in atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter
for the maintenance of nsr, rate control, as well as morbidity and mortality.  xxxd1944xxx  has been shown to prolong the time to atrial fibrillation recurrence to 60 –158
days compared with 5–59 days with placebo and decrease
heart rate during atrial fibrillation by 12–25 beats/min.
further data are needed regarding the mortality effects and
safety of  xxxd1944xxx . if approved,  xxxd1944xxx  will most
likely be used for the maintenance of nsr in patients
without structural heart disease.

extracto
objetivo: repasar la farmacología, farmacocinética, eficacia clínica, y
el perfil de seguridad de dronedarona para el tratamiento de fibrilación
auricular.
fuentes de datos: una búsqueda de la literatura se llevó a cabo
utilizando los términos dronedarona,  xxxd1944xxx , fibrilación auricular,
medicación antiarrítmica en medline (1966–febrero 2007),
international pharmaceutical abstracts (1970–febrero 2007), y
embase (1990–febrero 2007). referencias de los estudios
identificados y de artículos de repaso seleccionados fueron revisadas.
información adicional incluyendo extractos y afiches fueron obtenidos
de sanofi aventis.
selección de estudios y extracción de datos: estudios publicados y
extractos de reuniones evaluando los efectos de dronedarona en
humanos y en animales fueron revisados.
síntesis de datos: dronedarona es un medicamento antiarrítmico nuevo
para tratar fibrilación auricular. dronedarona tiene un mecanismo de
acción multifacético similar a  xxxd154xxx . dronedarona trabaja
bloqueando los canales de  xxxd2987xxx , sodio y calcio y exhibe propiedades
antiadrenérgicas. dronedarona ha sido evaluada a dosis de 400, 600, y
800 mg 2 veces al día. dronedarona alarga el tiempo de recurrencia de
fibrilación auricular a 60–158 días comparado con 5–59 días con
placebo y reduce el ritmo cardíaco durante fibrilación auricular por
12–25 latidos por minuto en pruebas clínicas. los eventos adversos
mayores incluyen efectos gastrointestinales y el riesgo de pro-arritmia.
dronedarona puede aumentar el riesgo de mortalidad en pacientes con
fallo cardíaco congestivo.

dronedarona es un agente antiarrítmico nuevo para el
tratamiento de fibrilación auricular. más estudios son necesarios para
definir mejor el perfil de seguridad y el lugar en la terapia de
dronedarona.

résumé
objectif: revoir la pharmacologie, la pharmacocinétique, l’efficacité
clinique, et l’innocuité de la dronédarone dans le traitement de la
fibrillation auriculaire.
revue de littérature: une recherche a été effectuée dans les bases de
données medline (1966–février 2007), international pharmaceutical
abstracts (1970–février 2007) et embase (1990–février 2007) avec
les mots-clés suivants: dronédarone,  xxxd1944xxx , fibrillation auriculaire, et
médication antiarythmique. les bibliographies d’articles ont également
été consultées. des informations extraites de résumés d’articles de
même que de posters ont été obtenues auprès de sanofi aventis. les
études évaluant les effets de la dronédarone chez l’animal et chez
l’humain ont été revues.
résumé: la dronédarone est un nouvel antiarythmique pour le traitement
de la fibrillation auriculaire. le mécanisme d’action de la dronédarone
est similaire à celui de l’amiodarone. la dronédarone bloque les canaux
potassiques, sodiques et calciques et possède également des propriétés
anti-adrénergiques. la dronédarone a été évaluée aux doses de 400, 600,
et 800 mg 2 fois par jour. dans les études, la dronédarone a permis
d’espacer les épisodes de fibrillation auriculaire de 60–158 jours
comparativement à 5–59 jours avec le placebo et de réduire la fréquence
cardiaque de 12–25 pulsations par minute lors de fibrillation auriculaire
dans les études cliniques. les effets indésirables graves incluent les
effets gastro-intestinaux et le risque pro-arythmique. la dronédarone
peut augmenter le risque de mortalité chez les patients souffrant
d’insuffisance cardiaque congestive.
conclusions: la dronédarone est un nouvel anti-arythmique pour le
traitement de la fibrillation auriculaire. d’autres études seront
nécessaires afin de mieux définir l’innocuité de la dronédarone et sa
place dans l’arsenal thérapeutique.
