identiﬁcation and saturable

humans: comparative

and in vitro administration

diabetes 2015;64:828–839 | doi: 10.2337/db14-0625

signaling pathways activated by leptin in metabolically
important organs have largely been studied only in animal
and/or cell culture studies. in this study, we examined
whether leptin has similar effects in human peripheral
tissues in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro and whether the
response would be different in lean and obese humans.
for in vivo leptin signaling,  xxxd2630xxx  was administered and muscle, adipose tissue, and peripheral blood
mononuclear cells were taken for analysis of signal
activation. experiments were also done ex vivo and with
primary cultured cells in vitro. the signal activation was
compared between male versus female and obese versus lean humans. acute in vivo, ex vivo, and/or in vitro
 xxxd2630xxx  administration similarly activated stat3,
ampk,  xxxg1369xxx /2, akt, mtor,  xxxg1559xxx , and/or  xxxg463xxx /b without any differences between male versus female and
obese versus lean subjects. all signaling pathways were
saturable at ∼30–50 ng/ml, consistent with the clinical
evidence showing no additional effect(s) in obese subjects who already have high levels of leptin. our data
provide novel information on downstream effectors of
 xxxd2630xxx  action in humans that may have therapeutic
implications.

leptin, the prototypical adipocyte-secreted hormone, primarily regulates food intake and body weight by acting in
the hypothalamus (1). in addition to the role of leptin in
the brain for regulation of energy balance, it has also been
shown that leptin acts in peripheral tissues as a regulator
of energy homeostasis, insulin action, lipid metabolism,
and immune function (2,3). leptin receptors are found
in various locations throughout the body supporting
the central as well as peripheral role of leptin in metabolism (4–6). administration of leptin has been observed to
markedly decrease insulin and glucose levels prior to
a decrease in food intake or changes in body weight in
leptin-deﬁcient rodents (7). also, peripheral leptin administration, but not food restriction, was able to fully correct
severe insulin resistance in lipoatrophic mice (8). these
results indicate that leptin may act at the level of insulinsensitive tissues independently from leptin’s central action
in regulating feeding behavior (7). therefore, it is important from the point of view of biology and human therapeutics to know which downstream signaling pathways
are activated by leptin to mediate its effects in the peripheral tissues.

recombinant human leptin ( xxxd2630xxx ) has been recently approved by the u.s. and japanese food and drug
administration for treatment in generalized lipodystrophy, shedding light on the therapeutic potential of leptin.
patients with lipodystrophy are deﬁcient in leptin, which
in turn results in severe insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia (9,10). leptin replacement therapy has
been reported to be effective in improving insulin resistance and the metabolic proﬁle in these patients (11–13).
however, whether  xxxd2630xxx  treatment has a direct effect
in metabolically important peripheral tissues in humans
remains unknown.
so far, it has been demonstrated only in animal models
that leptin administration activates peripheral intracellular
signaling pathways and plays a key role in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance (14–16). by contrast, whether
leptin has similar effects in human peripheral tissues
(hpts) in vivo and whether lean and obese humans would
respond differently has not yet been comparatively studied.
hence, in order to provide detailed evidence on  xxxd2630xxx 
signaling in human peripheral metabolism, we extended
previous observations (17) by studying in vivo  xxxd2630xxx 
signaling in insulin-sensitive tissues, i.e., human adipose
tissues (hats), human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(hpbmcs), and human muscle tissues (hmts). also, we
investigated ex vivo and in vitro  xxxd2630xxx  signaling in
hat, hpbmcs, hmt, human primary adipocytes (hpas),
and human primary muscle cells (hmcs). moreover, since
obesity is a state of generalized resistance or insensitivity
to leptin (18,19), it would be of value to study whether
there might be an impairment of leptin signaling pathways
and/or saturation in some or all signaling pathways downstream of leptin in the obese compared with the lean state.
therefore, we compared intracellular in vivo, ex vivo, and/
or in vitro  xxxd2630xxx  signaling pathways in hpt from
male versus female and obese versus lean subjects.
research design and methods
subjects

volunteers were recruited from the community and screened
at the clinical research center at beth israel deaconess
medical center (bidmc). all subjects provided written
informed consent to participate, and the study was approved
by the institutional review board at bidmc. subjects were
excluded if they had a history of any illness, other than
obesity, that may affect insulin sensitivity, use of medications
that are known to inﬂuence glucose metabolism, history of
anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid-like reactions, or a known
hypersensitivity to escherichia coli–derived proteins or anesthetic agents such as lidocaine or novocaine. subjects were
provided with take-home meals and consumed an isocaloric
diet, speciﬁcally designed for each subject, for 48 h prior to
their main study visit to ensure stable dietary intake.

cannula was placed in each antecubital fossa. the tissue
samples (hat from lower abdomen and hmt from thigh)
were immediately placed in a cryotube and frozen in liquid
nitrogen at the bedside. blood samples were taken for
 xxxd2630xxx  signaling experiments in hpbmcs. following
baseline sampling, an intravenous bolus of  xxxd2630xxx ,
dose 0.01 mg/kg body weight, or placebo (10 cc of normal
saline) was given by slow intravenous injection over 1
min. the subject rested supine. twenty minutes later, the
biopsy was repeated. to compare the signaling in lean and
obese patients, a bolus of  xxxd2630xxx  was administered
to six lean (male [n = 3), bmi 25.0 6 1.7 kg/m2; female
[n = 3], bmi 22.7 6 0.6 kg/m2) and six obese patients
(male [n = 3], bmi 35.3 6 8.4 kg/m2; female [n = 3], bmi
37.0 6 6.0 kg/m2).
ex vivo leptin administration

ex vivo leptin administration was performed as described
in detail previously (17). in brief, hat and hmt from
three lean females (bmi 22.8 6 2.1 kg/m2) and three
obese females (bmi 37.6 6 5.7 kg/m2) were minced into
pieces of ;1 mm in diameter and incubated at 37°c with
leptin for 30 min.
hpbmc culture

the hpbmcs were isolated from blood collected from the
same subjects as ex vivo by density gradient sedimentation on  xxxd3253xxx -paque (pharmacia, uppsala, sweden) as
described previously (17). after isolation of the hpbmcs,
the cells were washed twice in pbs and resuspended in
medium appropriate for cell culture (rpmi 1640 supplemented with 25 mmol/l hepes, 2 mmol/l l-glutamine,
100 mu/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5
mg/ml  xxxd164xxx ).
hpa culture

the hpa culture was performed as previously described
(20). discarded subcutaneous hats were collected from
obese females (n = 3, age 47.7 6 3.5 years, bmi 38.5 6
0.6 kg/m2) undergoing laparoscopic adjustable gastric
band, liposuction, or abdominoplasty at bidmc. the hat
was then digested with pbs/collagenase solution (3 mg collagenase/g tissue and 1 ml pbs/1 mg collagenase) + 3.5%
fatty acid–free bsa and then centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for
10 min. the pellets were resuspended in a-mem supplemented with 15 mmol/l nahco3, 15 mmol/l hepes, 33
mmol/l biotin, 17 mmol/l pantothenate, 10 mg/ml human
transferrin, 0.05 mg/ml gentamicin, and 10% fbs and
then were plated overnight. to induce adipocyte differentiation, conﬂuent cells were exposed to differentiation medium containing 66 nmol/l insulin, 100 nmol/l cortisol,
0.2 nmol/l triiodothyronine, and 1 mg/ml ciglitazone. the
medium was changed every 2 days for 28 days and then
used for experiments.
hmc culture

in vivo leptin administration

on the morning of the main study visit, subjects attended
the clinical research center after a 12-h fast. an intravenous

the hmc culture was performed as previously described
(21). thigh muscle (vastus lateralis) was collected from
obese females (n = 3, age 41.0 6 7.9 years, bmi 43.5 6

leptin signaling in human peripheral tissues

1.7 kg/m2). biopsied skeletal muscle tissue was minced
into small pieces and incubated in dissociation media containing 0.1% bsa, 0.25% trypsin-edta, and 0.1% collagenase in 37°c water bath for 1 h. after centrifugation,
the pellet was resuspended in skeletal muscle cell growth
media (promocell, heidelberg, germany) and plated on
t25 culture dish. after reaching 70–80% conﬂuence,
growth media was switched to skeletal muscle cell differentiation media (promocell, heidelberg, germany) for the
differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes. after 5 days
of differentiation, the media was changed back to growth
media for an additional 2–4 days for a stable differentiation, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
protein extraction and western blotting

cells were suspended in a lysis buffer containing 20
mmol/l tris-hcl (ph 7.4), 150 mmol/l nacl, 5 mmol/l
edta, 0.1 mmol/l phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride, 0.05%
aprotinin, and 0.1% igepal and then incubated for 30
min at 4°c. the suspension was centrifuged for 25 min at
14,240g, and the supernatant was saved as the total extract. fifty micrograms of tissue lysate protein per lane
was resolved by sds-page (8% gel) and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes (schleicher & schuell, inc.,
keene, nh). the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked
with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and
incubated with primary antibody (1:500 dilution) in 1%
nonfat dry milk overnight at 4°c. the membranes were
washed with tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% tween
20 (tbst) for 30 min, incubated with horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (1:1,000 dilution; amersham
pharmacia biotech, arlington heights, il) for 2 h, and
washed with tbst for 30 min. the bands were visualized
using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (amersham
pharmacia biotech) and quantiﬁed using imagej (http://
rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/).
lipolysis

lipolysis assay was performed using [14c] xxxd2777xxx  method
(22). in brief, the cells were seeded on 12-well culture
plates. before preloading the cultures with [14c] xxxd2777xxx ,
cultures were serum starved for 24 h. then, 20 ml pbs
containing 6.25 nmol [14c] xxxd2777xxx  (50 mci/mmol) was
added for 15 h; 90% of [14c] xxxd2777xxx  was sequestered by
the cultures during this incubation. the medium was then
removed and the cells were washed four times, resulting in
a background radioactivity of ,1,000 dpm. each well was
treated with leptin in the presence or absence of  xxxd2401xxx  as a positive control. after 72 h of leptin treatment,
200 ml of medium was collected from each well and delivered to the liquid scintillation counting vial to measure
[14c] xxxd2777xxx  released to the medium.
cardiac myocyte and uterine smooth muscle cell
culture

the cells were purchased from promocell gmbh (heidelberg,
germany). the cells were cultured according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

diabetes volume 64, march 2015

hypertrophy

hypertrophy assay was performed as described in detail
previously (23). in brief, the cells were grown in 48-well
plates and ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde in pbs for 15
min, followed by 0.5% triton-100 treatment for 5 min.
after incubation with 0.1% rhodamine-phalloidin for 30
min, cells were washed in pbs for further interaction
with dapi. the images of cell surface area from randomly
selected ﬁelds (50 for each group, at least 200 cells) were
determined by imagej (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/).
statistical analysis

all data were analyzed using student t test and/or oneway anova followed by post hoc test for multiple comparisons using spss (version 11.5).
results
regulation of stat3,  xxxg1369xxx /2, akt, and ampk
signaling by in vivo  xxxd2630xxx  administration in hpt

to compare the leptin-induced signaling in peripheral
tissues,  xxxd2630xxx  was administered in vivo, and hat,
hpbmcs, and hmt were collected. expanding from our
previous study (17), in vivo  xxxd2630xxx  administration
stimulated phosphorylation of stat3 (fig. 1a),  xxxg1369xxx /2
(fig. 1b), and akt (fig. 1c) by ;2.5- to ;3.3-fold in
hat and hpbmcs, but not hmt, when compared with
control. we also observed that in vivo  xxxd2630xxx  administration stimulates phosphorylation of ampk in
all tissues (fig. 1d). as shown in fig. 1, there was no
difference in stat3,  xxxg1369xxx /2, akt, and/or ampk activation in response to in vivo  xxxd2630xxx  administration in obese versus lean and male versus female
subjects.
regulation of mtor signaling by in vivo, ex vivo, and/or
in vitro  xxxd2630xxx  administration in hpt

in addition to stat3,  xxxg1369xxx /2, ampk, and akt, we
observed that in vivo  xxxd2630xxx  administration stimulates phosphorylation of mtor (fig. 2a) by ;2.7- to
;3.1-fold in hat and hpbmcs, but not hmt, when compared with control. we also observed that ex vivo  xxxd2630xxx  administration activates mtor signaling in hat
(fig. 2b) in a dose-dependent manner. moreover, dose
response experiments showed that in vitro administration
of up to 200 ng/ml of  xxxd2630xxx  for 30 min signiﬁcantly induces phosphorylation of mtor in hpas (fig.
2c) and hpbmcs (fig. 2d). importantly, metreleptinactivated mtor signaling was saturable at a  xxxd2630xxx 
concentration of ;50 ng/ml. by contrast, ex vivo and/or
in vitro  xxxd2630xxx  administration did not regulate mtor
signaling in hmt (fig. 2e) and hmcs (fig. 2f). there was
no difference in mtor activation in response to in vivo
 xxxd2630xxx  administration in obese versus lean and male
versus female subjects.
regulation of  xxxg1559xxx  and  xxxg463xxx /b signaling by ex vivo
and/or in vitro  xxxd2630xxx  administration in hpt

we observed that ex vivo and/or in vitro  xxxd2630xxx 
administration stimulates phosphorylation of  xxxg1559xxx 

and  xxxg463xxx /b in hat (fig. 3a and fig. 4a), hpas (fig. 3b
and fig. 4b), and hpbmcs (fig. 3c and fig. 4c) in a dosedependent manner. similar to the results for mtor
signaling,  xxxd2630xxx -activated  xxxg1559xxx  and/or  xxxg463xxx /b
signaling was saturable at a  xxxd2630xxx  concentration of
;50 ng/ml. by contrast, ex vivo and/or in vitro  xxxd2630xxx 

administration did not regulate  xxxg1559xxx  and/or  xxxg463xxx /b signaling in hmt (fig. 3d and fig. 4d) and hmcs (fig. 3e
and fig. 4e). there was no difference in  xxxg1559xxx  and/or
 xxxg463xxx /b activation in response to ex vivo and/or in vitro
 xxxd2630xxx  administration in obese versus lean subjects
(data not shown).

regulation of  xxxg1894xxx  signaling by in vivo, ex vivo, and/or
in vitro  xxxd2630xxx  administration in hpt

experiments comparing obese versus lean and male versus
female subjects.

we observed that in vivo (fig. 5a) and ex vivo (fig. 5b and
c)  xxxd2630xxx  administration has no effects on  xxxg1894xxx  activation in all hpts. there was no difference in  xxxg1894xxx  activation in response to in vivo  xxxd2630xxx  administration in

regulation of differentiation and lipolysis by in vitro
 xxxd2630xxx  administration in hpas

we observed that in vitro  xxxd2630xxx  administration has
no effects on differentiation in hpas (fig. 6a and b). by

contrast, we observed that in vitro  xxxd2630xxx  administration induces lipolysis in hpas (fig. 6c). there was no
difference in differentiation and lipolysis in response to in
vitro  xxxd2630xxx  administration in experiments comparing subcutaneous versus omental adipocytes.

regulation of cell growth signaling and hypertrophy
by in vitro  xxxd2630xxx  administration in cardiac
myocytes and uterine smooth muscle cells

in vitro  xxxd2630xxx  administration increased stat3 activation, but this effect was abolished by coadministration of

stat3 inhibitor in both cardiac myocytes (cms) and uterine
smooth muscle cells (usms) (fig. 7a). also, we observed
that in vitro  xxxd2630xxx  administration increases  xxxg1369xxx /2,
jnk, and/or p38 phosphorylation in cms (fig. 7b). in vitro
 xxxd2630xxx  administration also increased  xxxg1369xxx /2 and/or
p38 phosphorylation in usms (fig. 7b). by contrast, jnk
was not regulated by in vitro  xxxd2630xxx  administration
in usms (fig. 7b). hypertrophy was increased by
in vitro  xxxd2630xxx  administration in both cms and
usms (fig. 7c).
discussion

with the recent approval of  xxxd2630xxx  for the treatment
of lipodystrophy-related metabolic complications, understanding leptin biology in humans has become of major
importance. to determine the direct effect of leptin on
peripheral tissues in humans, we studied the in vivo
 xxxd2630xxx  signaling in insulin-sensitive tissues such as
hat and hpbmcs, and hmt, and found that leptin
activates peripheral stat3, ampk,  xxxg1369xxx /2, akt, mtor,

 xxxg1559xxx , and/or  xxxg463xxx /b signaling. subsequently, we found
no difference in in vivo, ex vivo, and/or in vitro  xxxd2630xxx  signaling between male versus female and obese
versus lean subjects.
the jak2/stat3 pathway is one of the ﬁrst identiﬁed
signaling downstream of  xxxg1320xxx  activation
(24,25). stat3 is a transcription factor that mediates
the expression of a variety of genes in many cellular processes, such as cell growth and apoptosis (26). we observed herein that  xxxd2630xxx  activates stat3 signaling
in hat and hpbmcs, but not in hmt. interestingly, unlike
our results presented herein, in vivo  xxxd2630xxx  administration has been shown to increase stat3 activation in
hmt from young healthy males (27). the different response could have derived from the differences in the
duration of leptin infusion. whereas this prior paper
has shown stat3 activation after 1 h infusion, the in
vivo  xxxd2630xxx  infusion studied herein was 1 min and
the signaling was observed 20 min after infusion. thus,
the activation of stat3 by in vivo  xxxd2630xxx  in hmt
needs to be further elucidated in future studies.

we have previously shown that leptin-induced erk/
mtor/akt signaling is important for cell survival and/or
proliferation in hat and hpbmcs ex vivo (20), and mouse
hypothalamic, liver, and muscle cell lines in vitro (14).
others have also reported that leptin stimulates glucose
uptake in mouse muscle cells by activation of  xxxg1366xxx  (28).
similarly, we observed herein that in vivo  xxxd2630xxx 
administration activates  xxxg1369xxx /2, mtor, and akt signaling in hat and hpbmcs, through the activation of which
 xxxd2630xxx  may have a beneﬁcial effect on cell proliferation and survival in humans.
leptin has been reported to directly stimulate fatty
acid oxidation in skeletal muscle (29,30), and in the obese
state, leptin-induced fatty acid oxidation seems to be impaired partly through inactivation of ampk signaling by
 xxxg466xxx  3 (socs3) (31,32). contrary to these ﬁndings, we observed that in vivo  xxxd2630xxx  administration activates ampk signaling in all
hpts without any difference between lean and obese subjects, showing that leptin could still stimulate ampk

signaling in obese humans, which could play a pivotal
role in peripheral glucose/lipid metabolism. therefore,
 xxxd2630xxx -stimulated ampk signaling in hpt may be
an attractive therapeutic target for reducing lipotoxicity
in obesity and type 2 diabetes. there is still a possibility
that although the signaling pathways appear normal in
obese patients, downstream functional effects such as
fatty acid oxidation may be impaired, which needs to be
further examined.
 xxxg1894xxx  has been shown to promote  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling in
response to insulin and  xxxg681xxx  (egf)
binding to their receptors (33,34). in the brain,  xxxg1894xxx  activates leptin signaling and regulates the hypothalamus in
controlling energy balance and metabolism (35). in contrast, we did not ﬁnd any association between  xxxg1894xxx  and
 xxxg1369xxx /2. in fact, we did not observe any  xxxg1894xxx  activation in
in vivo, ex vivo, and/or in vitro  xxxd2630xxx  administration

we and others have recently shown that  xxxd2630xxx 
can reverse the suppression of the immune system and
maintain the balance between pro- and anti-inﬂammatory
cells (37,38). moreover, it has been demonstrated that
leptin, as a cytokine, stimulates immune cells, speciﬁcally
cd4+ t lymphocytes, to synthesize and release inﬂammatory proteins such as interleukin-2 (il-2) and interferon-g
(ifn-g) (39). speciﬁcally,  xxxd2630xxx  is closely linked to
the activation of inﬂammatory pathways  xxxg1559xxx /ikk
(40) and increased  xxxg357xxx 
( xxxg357xxx ), which can attract the immune cells to the site of
inﬂammation (41). in addition to its direct effects on
immune system physiology,  xxxd2630xxx  may indirectly
affect immune system function by improving insulin resistance, blood vessel inﬂammation, and cardiovascular
disease associated with hyperleptinemic states such as
obesity. here, we observed that in vivo and/or ex vivo
 xxxd2630xxx  administration activates  xxxg1559xxx /ikk cascade
signaling in hpbmcs, but it is still unclear whether this
can lead to regulation of the immune system in obese/
diabetic subjects, similar to what we have seen in women
with hypothalamic amenorrhea (39).
as mentioned above, the molecules observed herein are
well known for their general role in cell growth/survival/
metabolic/immune regulation. therefore, the observed in
vivo signaling after  xxxd2630xxx  infusion in humans could
be a result of an indirect effect via activation of other
cytokines such as  xxxg2296xxx  and interleukins. however, our
in vitro study rules out this possibility by clearly showing
that leptin can directly activate these pathways in pbmcs,
adipocytes, and muscle cells.
although it is well documented that one of the mechanisms for extreme leptin resistance is the impairment of
 xxxg1320xxx  signaling due to  xxxg1320xxx  mutations

(1), the underpinnings of leptin resistance in the vast majority of leptin-resistant states remains unknown. interestingly, we did not observe any major differences in
 xxxd2630xxx  signaling activation in tissues from obese versus lean subjects. also, the effect of leptin on adipocyte
function, such as differentiation and lipolysis, was unaltered
in adipocytes from obese compared with lean subjects, indicating that the ability to respond to leptin remains unchanged in the obese state. however, all  xxxd2630xxx 
signaling pathways studied in hpts were saturable at ;50
ng/ml, suggesting that above that level, i.e., the level clinically seen in obese subjects at baseline (17), no additional
signaling effects could be observed. in fact, we have previously reported in pharmacokinetic studies that acute leptin infusion increases circulating leptin levels by several
orders of magnitude, .100 ng/ml, within 20–30 min
(42–44). leptin at a dose of 10 mg twice daily by subcutaneous injection increased circulating total leptin by 10-fold
after 4 weeks, and by 30-fold after 16 weeks, whereas free
leptin levels peaked at 50–60 ng/ml even after 16 weeks
(17). the fact that no difference exists in hpt of lean versus
obese subjects implies that administration of leptin may
still have a beneﬁcial effect on peripheral leptin signaling
and downstream metabolism, but hyperleptinemic states
observed in obese individuals make it difﬁcult to enhance
the peripheral signaling pathway in vivo. it has been demonstrated that central administration of  xxxd2630xxx  affects
insulin sensitivity and metabolism in peripheral tissues
(45), and therefore  xxxd2630xxx -activated signaling pathways may prove to be much more complex and possibly
involve both the central nervous system and the periphery.
it is also possible that the observed responses and/or the
lack of differences between lean and obese subjects in response to  xxxd2630xxx  treatment in hpt could possibly be

leptin signaling in human peripheral tissues

totally different from signaling responses in hypothalamus
and/or other central nervous system areas.
this study is the very ﬁrst attempt to map the
intracellular signaling pathways downstream of  xxxd2630xxx  in hpt in vivo. our data from in vivo, ex vivo, and in
vitro provide novel insights into the  xxxd2630xxx  signaling
pathways that would mediate energy homeostasis, insulin
resistance/metabolism, and immune function in humans
and thus add value on the biology of leptin, i.e., a molecule
that was recently approved for use in humans. the
limitation of this study is that we have used only three
subjects in each study. nevertheless, the similar pattern
throughout in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro among female
and male subjects in all signaling pathways observed
provides evidence that there is no difference in the
signaling between lean versus obese or men versus
women. it is possible that differences in methodology
and procedures, including timing of blood sampling, could
have resulted in differences between this and prior studies
by others, and in vitro manipulation may have induced
desensitization of the tissues. also, there is a possibility
that the study is underpowered given the small number of
subjects herein but these data are consistent with our prior
independent study that had twice as many subjects. larger
studies need to be conducted to extend these observations
and conﬁrm our ﬁndings. this study, followed by future in
vivo  xxxd2630xxx  studies involving additional signaling
pathways in other various hpts, will eventually allow the
full mapping and characterization of signaling pathways
downstream of leptin in human tissues. we believe that
our data enhance the current knowledge on the mechanisms underlying  xxxd2630xxx  actions in humans and
provide crucial information for the development of new
