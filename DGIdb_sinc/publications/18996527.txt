a b s t r a c t
 xxxg1575xxx  ( xxxg1575xxx ) catalyses the conversion of nicotinamide to 1methylnicotinamide and plays an important role in hepatic detoxiﬁcation reactions. here we show
that, in addition to the liver, 3t3-l1 adipocytes as well as human and murine adipose tissue explants
express high amounts of enzymatically active  xxxg1575xxx .  xxxg1575xxx  mrna levels and enzyme activity increased
in 3t3-l1 cells in a differentiation-dependent manner. homocysteine, the atherogenic product of the
 xxxg1575xxx -catalyzed reaction, was secreted from 3t3-l1 cells or adipose tissue cultures. homocysteine
release increased during 3t3-l1 differentiation and was reduced when adipose tissue was treated with
the  xxxg1575xxx  inhibitor 1-methylnicotinamide.  xxxd2715xxx  (na), a widely used drug to lower elevated
plasma lipid levels, induced  xxxg1575xxx  enzyme activity in white adipose tissue of mice. in tissue culture
nicotinamide treatment led to an increase in adipose tissue homocysteine secretion. these data support
the concept that adipose tissue  xxxg1575xxx  contributes to the increased plasma homocysteine levels in
patients treated with na.

1. introduction
 xxxg1575xxx  ( xxxg1575xxx ) is an important
cytosolic methyltransferase involved in detoxiﬁcation reactions
of the liver. the enzyme catalyzes the reaction of s-adenosyl-lmethionine with nicotinamide (and structurally related pyridines)
yielding  xxxd3157xxx  and 1-methylnicotinamide.
 xxxg1575xxx  is structurally and functionally related to thioether smethyltransferase and  xxxg1791xxx 
[1,2]. nicotinamide (nam), the amide of  xxxd2715xxx  (na, vitamin
b3), is the precursor of the coenzyme beta-nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (nad), an essential cofactor for numerous oxidoreductases.
with s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx  as the methyl group donor, the
 xxxg1575xxx  reaction yields two products: 1-methylnicotinamide, which
is excreted into urine, and  xxxd3157xxx , which
is converted into homocysteine by  xxxd3157xxx 
hydrolase [3]. as hyperhomocysteinemia is a suspected risk fac-

tor for atherosclerosis, factors affecting the plasma concentrations
of homocysteine attracted signiﬁcant clinical interest. to lower
plasma homocysteine levels, enzymes involved in homocysteine
transformation, such as  xxxg1475xxx ,
 xxxg350xxx , and  xxxg1479xxx , have been
targeted for increased activity by  xxxd2146xxx , vitamin b12, and  xxxd3049xxx  supplementation, respectively [4,5]. in a genome-wide
association study, souto et al. [6] recently identiﬁed the  xxxg1575xxx  gene
as a potential major genetic determinant of plasma homocysteine
levels.
 xxxg1575xxx  is found in the liver [7] catalyzing the biotransformation of many drugs and xenobiotic compounds [8]. inter-individual
variation in the level of  xxxg1575xxx  activity in the human liver may
contribute to the interindividual variability in drug metabolism,
therapeutic efﬁcacy, and drug toxicity [1,2]. speciﬁcally, due to
its homology to nicotinamide,  xxxg1575xxx  may participate in the
metabolism of na, a widely used drug to lower elevated plasma
lipid levels [9], increase the concentration of plasma hdl cholesterol [10], and reduce the progression of atherosclerosis [11].
the observation that the initial effects of na are conﬁned to processes in adipose tissue (e.g., inhibition of
lipolysis [12]) and microarray-based gene expression data
(http://symatlas.gnf.org/symatlas/) suggested the presence of
murine  xxxg1575xxx  in white adipose tissue (wat). this prompted us

m. riederer et al. / atherosclerosis 204 (2009) 412–417

to investigate the expression and function of  xxxg1575xxx  in adipocytes.
we found that active  xxxg1575xxx  is present in adipose tissue and
contributes to the secretion of homocysteine and that  xxxg1575xxx 
enzyme activity is induced in mice treated with na.
2. materials and methods
2.1. cell culture and differentiation of 3t3-l1 ﬁbroblasts
3t3-l1 mouse embryo ﬁbroblasts (crl173) were obtained from
the american type culture collection (rockville, ma) and maintained in dulbecco modiﬁed eagle’s minimal essential medium
(dmem) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (fcs),
50 iu/ml penicillin, and 50 ␮g/ml streptomycin. cells were cultured
at 37 ◦ c in a 5% co2 humidiﬁed atmosphere. the adipogenic differentiation of 3t3-l1 ﬁbroblasts was performed by a modiﬁcation
of the method of rubin et al. [13,14]. two days after reaching conﬂuence (day 0 of differentiation), monolayers of 3t3-l1
cells were exposed to a basal medium containing 0.4 ␮g/ml dexamethasone, 0.5 mm isobuthylmethylxanthine, 10 ␮g/ml insulin,
0.8 ␮g/ml biotin, and 4 ␮g/ml pantothenic acid. after 48 h, the
medium was replaced with basal medium containing 10 ␮g/ml
insulin, 0.8 ␮g/ml biotin, and 4 ␮g/ml pantothenic acid. this
medium was changed every 2 days. on the day of analysis, cells
maintained in 6-well dishes were either lysed for rna isolation or
 xxxg1575xxx  activity assay, or were incubated with serum-free dmem for
homocysteine determination.
2.2. northern blotting
rna was isolated from cells or murine tissues using trizolreagent (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. equal amounts of rna were subjected to electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel containing 5% formaldehyde and
transferred to a nylon membrane (hybond-n+-nylon transfer
membrane, amersham, uppsala, sweden). probes for northern
hybridization were generated by pcr ampliﬁcation (advantage
cdna polymerase mix (bd biosciences clontech, palo alto, ca))
of selected target sequences with subsequent cloning into pst
blue-1 (novagen, darmstadt, germany) in e. coli xl-1.  xxxg1575xxx 
and p0 were ampliﬁed from mouse cdna using the following primers (forward: 5 -ccggaattc-ggaatctggcttcacc-3 ;
reverse: 5 -ccggaattc-tcattcagatctgcctg-3 ) for  xxxg1575xxx 
and
5 -tcgttggagtgacatcgtct-3
and
5 -taagcaggctgacttggttg-3 (for p0). the  xxxg1575xxx  and p0 dna fragments
were 32 p-labeled by random oligonucleotide-primed synthesis
using the prime-a-gene kit according to the vendor’s protocol
(promega, prime-a-gene labeling system, madison, wi). after
hybridization, the blot was exposed to a phosphor screen and
read out on a phosphor imager (storm 860, molecular dynamics,
uppsala, sweden). expression of  xxxg1575xxx  was determined in relation
to p0.
2.3. real-time pcr (rt-pcr)
alternatively to northern blotting experiments, the abundance
of  xxxg1575xxx  transcripts was examined by rt-pcr. rna of cell and
tissue samples was isolated as described above. 1.5 ␮g of rna
were reversely transcribed using the archive cdna kit (applied
biosystems, foster city, ca) and 0.7 u of an rnase inhibitor (qiagen, hilden, germany). rt-pcr analysis was performed in 384-well
plates in a total volume of 4 ␮l containing 2 ng of original total rna
using the qantifast sybr green rt-pcr kit (qiagen) and validated
quantitect primer assays (qiagen) according to the manufacturers’ instructions for light cycler 480 instruments. in brief, after

413

the initial heat activation step at 95 ◦ c for 5 min, cycling conditions consisted of 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 ◦ c for 10 s
and combined annealing and extension at 60 ◦ c for 30 s. the
pcr-efﬁciency of the target and housekeeping genes was determined by cdna dilution series prepared from a pooled sample
and results were accordingly efﬁciency corrected with the lightcycler relative quantiﬁcation software (roche diagnostics, basel,
switzerland). mrna levels of murine and human  xxxg1575xxx  (primer
assays qt01665006 and qt00076041) were normalized to murine
 xxxg861xxx  or human beta-2microglobulin (primer assays qt01665006 and qt01665006) and
expressed as relative ratio. all samples were assayed twice and
in duplicate and the average value of the duplicates was used for
quantiﬁcation.
2.4.  xxxg1575xxx  activity assay
 xxxg1575xxx  activity was determined by the radiochemical enzymatic
assay of rini et al. [15]. this assay is based on the conversion
of nicotinamide to radioactively labeled n1-methylnicotinamide
using [methyl-14 c]-ado-met as the methyl donor. the enzyme
activity of  xxxg1575xxx  activity is expressed as the formation of
nanomoles of n1-methylnicotinamide per hour of incubation at
37 ◦ c.
cultured cells from one 6-well dish were scraped into 300 ␮l
5 mm tris, ph 7.2 and sonicated until completely suspended. tissue
was homogenized with a polytron homogenizer in nine volumes
(w/v) of 5 mm k-ph buffer ph 7.5 for two consecutive 15 s time
periods. homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min,
and the supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min
and immediately assayed for  xxxg1575xxx  activity. tissue homogenate
supernatants were diluted 10-fold (liver) or 2-fold (wat) with
5 mm  xxxd3449xxx  ph 7.2. cell lysates from cell culture were applied
without further dilution. each sample (100 ␮l) was mixed with
10 ␮l of 150 mm nicotinamide (sigma, st. louis, mo) dissolved in
 xxxd1896xxx  (dmso) or 10 ␮l of dmso alone as a negative
control. the reaction was initiated by the addition of a 40 ␮l aliquot
containing 10 ␮l of 375 ␮m [14 c-methyl]-ado-met (speciﬁc activity 3.5 ␮ci/␮mol, perkinelmer, boston, ma) and 30 ␮l of 500 mm
tris–hcl buffer, ph 7.4. the ﬁnal concentrations of nicotinamide
and ado-met in the reaction were 10 mm and 25 ␮m, respectively.
the reactions were incubated in a shaking water bath at 37 ◦ c for
20 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 ␮l of
0.5 m borate buffer, ph 10. next, 100 ␮l of 0.85 m 1-heptane sulfonic acid was added, followed by 5 ml of 60% isoamylalcohol in
toluene. the tubes were vortexed for 10 s and centrifuged at 400 × g
for 10 min. subsequently, 3.5 ml of the organic phase was transferred to a liquid scintillation counting vial, and radioactivity was
measured after the addition of 10 ml of ultima gold scintillation
cocktail (perkinelmer). all results were corrected for quenching
(subtraction of the dmso value), counting efﬁciency, and efﬁciency
of partitioning the reaction product into the organic phase (62%).
assays were conducted immediately after tissue/cell lysis, as frozen
murine  xxxg1575xxx  is rather unstable [15]. protein concentrations were
determined by the method of bradford using bovine  xxxg124xxx 
as a standard [16].
2.5. homocysteine measurement
to determine the homocysteine level in cell culture supernatants, 3t3-l1 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline
(pbs) four times and incubated with 1 ml serum-free dmem (no
additives) for 1 h. the cell culture supernatants were then harvested
and frozen until homocysteine measurement. murine wat and
liver specimens were surgically dissected into small pieces of less

414

m. riederer et al. / atherosclerosis 204 (2009) 412–417

than 10 ␮g weight, washed with pbs, and incubated in 96-well cell
culture plates for 15 h at 37 ◦ c with serum-free dmem with or without 1 mm of the  xxxg1575xxx  inhibitor 1-methyl nicotinamide (1-mnm).
after the incubation period, tissue culture supernatants were harvested and immediately frozen until homocysteine measurement.
cell layer and tissue samples were washed with pbs, lysed in 0.3 n
naoh/0.1% sds and protein content was determined by the method
of bradford. for the quantitation of homocysteine in mouse plasma,
blood was drawn from the extraorbital plexus of anaesthesized ad
libitum fed or overnight-fasted animals (with edta-coated capillaries). the sample was immediately centrifuged and plasma was
frozen at −20 ◦ c. total homocysteine levels were determined by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry with isotope
labeled homocysteine as internal standard as described by tuschl
et al. [17].
2.6.  xxxd2715xxx  (na)—treatment
c57bl/6j mice were obtained from the institute of biomedical research (himberg, austria) and kept on a standard laboratory
rodent chow diet (4.5%, w/w fat; ssniff, soest, germany) or when
indicated on a high fat diet (30%, w/w fat, medium chain fatty
acids, ssniff). both male and female mice aged 2–6 months were
used for experiments. the mice had free access to food and water
throughout the experiment. four to ﬁve mice were kept per cage
and maintained on a regular light–dark cycle. for long-term treatment with na, the mice received 1% na in their drinking water
for 4 weeks (calculated daily dose: 1–2 g/kg, dependent on drinking volume). at the end of the treatment,  xxxg1575xxx  gene expression
and enzymatic activity was determined in adipose tissue and liver
samples.

fig. 1.  xxxg1575xxx  mrna is expressed in murine and human adipose tissue. (a) rna
extracted from murine tissues was analyzed for  xxxg1575xxx  expression by northern
hybridization. the housekeeping gene acidic ribosomal protein p0 was used as a
loading control. liv, liver; wat, white adipose tissue; bat, brown adipose tissue.
(b) rna of human subcutaneous or omental adipose tissue was analyzed for  xxxg1575xxx 
expression by real-time pcr.  xxxg1575xxx  mrna was normalized to  xxxg233xxx 
and the relative expression (ratio) was calculated with the light cycler relative
quantiﬁcation software (roche). experiments of (a) and (b) were performed twice
and in duplicates.

differentiation time course (fig. 2b). at day 8 of differentiation,
 xxxg1575xxx  activity was 4.6-fold higher than in undifferentiated cells
indicating that  xxxg1575xxx  is induced during adipogenesis.
the expression of an enzymatically active  xxxg1575xxx  in adipose
tissue suggested a physiological function for the enzyme in tissuespeciﬁc methylation processes. to analyze whether homocysteine
was generated and released as byproduct of the  xxxg1575xxx -catalyzed
reaction, homocysteine concentrations were determined in media

2.7. human adipose tissue samples
human subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue samples
(n = 3) were obtained from organ donors after the removal of
organs to be transplanted (approved by the ethics committee of
the medical university graz, nr. 19-122 ex 07/08). samples were
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen until analysis.
2.8. statistical analysis
cell and tissue culture experiments were performed three times
and values are expressed as mean plus standard-deviation. statistical signiﬁcance was determined by the student’s unpaired
t-test (two-tailed). group differences were considered signiﬁcant
for *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.
3. results
to determine whether the  xxxg1575xxx  gene was expressed in adipose
tissue, total rna preparations from murine wat, bat and liver were
subjected to northern blotting analyses. as shown in fig. 1a, both
wat and bat expressed high levels of  xxxg1575xxx  mrna. mrna levels
were highest in wat followed by liver and bat.  xxxg1575xxx  mrna was
also detected in human omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue
samples (fig. 1b).
next, we examined the mrna expression proﬁle of  xxxg1575xxx 
during adipocyte differentiation of 3t3-l1 cells (fig. 2a). undifferentiated 3t3-l1 preadipocytes expressed low but detectable levels
of  xxxg1575xxx  mrna. during the time course of differentiation,  xxxg1575xxx 
mrna expression successively increased. on day 8 after the initiation of differentiation  xxxg1575xxx  mrna levels were 12-fold higher
than in undifferentiated cells. in accordance with elevated mrna
concentrations,  xxxg1575xxx  enzyme activity also increased during the

fig. 2.  xxxg1575xxx  mrna levels and enzyme activity increase during differentiation
of 3t3-l1 adipocytes. (a) rna was extracted from differentiating 3t3-l1 ﬁbroblasts at the indicated time points and analyzed for  xxxg1575xxx  expression by northern
hybridization. the housekeeping gene acidic ribosomal protein p0 was used as a
loading control (see insert). the graph shows the  xxxg1575xxx  signal normalized to p0
expression. experiments were performed twice and were conﬁrmed by rt-pcr
(data not shown). (b) cell lysates of differentiating 3t3-l1 adipocytes were assayed
for  xxxg1575xxx  activity.  xxxg1575xxx  enzymatic activity was determined in triplicate by scintillation counting of generated [14 c]-methylnicotinamide, using nicotinamide and
[14 c]- xxxd3156xxx  as substrates at the indicated time points. data are
presented as means ± s.d. and are representative of two independent experiments.

3t3-l1 cells were washed and incubated with medium without additives for 2 h
at the indicated time points during differentiation. homocysteine secreted into the
media was then measured by hplc. data are presented as means ± s.d. (n = 3) and

fig. 4.  xxxg1575xxx  activity in wat is enhanced by na treatment. mice fed a chow (a)
or high-fat diet (b) received 1% na with their drinking water for 4 weeks. tissues
were then excised and  xxxg1575xxx  enzymatic activity was determined by scintillation
counting of generated [14 c]-methylnicotinamide, using nicotinamide and [14 c]-sadenosyl-methionine as substrates. data are presented as means of two independent
experiments ± s.d. (n = 5–10 mice per group).  xxxg1575xxx  activity in human adipose tissue samples (n = 6) was determined only without na treatment. (c)  xxxg1575xxx  tissue
mrna expression (of one subset of the chow fed animals) was determined by rt-pcr
and expressed in relation to the expression of mouse  xxxg861xxx . measurements were
performed in duplicates (n = 10 mice per group) and the relative expression (ratio)
was calculated with the light cycler relative quantiﬁcation software (roche).

of differentiating 3t3-l1 cells. as shown in fig. 3, homocysteine levels increased during the differentiation time course in cell media.
by day 12 of differentiation, the homocysteine concentration in the
medium was 6-fold higher than in the medium of undifferentiated
cells.
to determine whether  xxxg1575xxx  was enzymatically active in mammalian tissues,  xxxg1575xxx  activity was measured in murine fat pads
and liver samples as well as human adipose tissue. additionally,
we investigated the effect of na, a potential substrate for  xxxg1575xxx , on
enzyme activity and mrna levels. as shown in fig. 4a,  xxxg1575xxx  was
enzymatically active in both murine and human wat. chronic na
treatment of mice for 4 weeks induced  xxxg1575xxx  activity in murine
wat by 3–4-fold. in contrast, na treatment did not signiﬁcantly
affect liver  xxxg1575xxx  activity. evaluating the impact of fat mass on namediated  xxxg1575xxx -induction,  xxxg1575xxx  activity was measured in wat
and liver of mice fed a high fat (hf) diet for 3 months followed by
an additional 4 weeks of hf diet and na treatment. high fat consumption caused signiﬁcantly increased body weight and fat mass.
similarly, as observed in chow fed animals (fig. 4a), wat  xxxg1575xxx 
activity markedly increased in response to na, whereas the liver
enzyme activity remained unchanged (fig. 4b). interestingly, the
absolute values of  xxxg1575xxx  activity were higher in wat of mice fed
a hf diet compared to those on chow diet (compare fig. 4a and b).
 xxxg1575xxx  mrna levels in murine liver and wat were unaffected by
na suggesting that the induction of  xxxg1575xxx  enzyme activity in wat
was entirely resulting from post-transcriptional processes (fig. 4c).
a major adverse effect of na treatment in humans are the
commonly observed increased plasma homocysteine levels [18,19].
therefore, we tested whether the treatment of tissue samples with
na affects the generation and release of homocysteine into the
medium. increased homocysteine release (+46%) was only observed
when tissue samples were treated with nam, but not with na

fig. 5. homocysteine release (a) wat and liv tissues of untreated fed animals were
excised and co-incubated for 15 h in serum-free dmem with or without 1 mm of na,
nam or 1-methylnicotinamide (1-mnm), an inhibitor of  xxxg1575xxx . homocysteine was
subsequently determined from tissue culture supernatants and was normalized to
tissue weight. experiments were performed thrice and in triplicates. (b) mice on a
hf diet received 1% na with their drinking water or water alone for 4 weeks (plus hf
diet). before and after the end of the na treatment period, mice were fasted overnight
and homocysteine levels were determined in blood plasma. the experiment was
performed once with 8–10 mice per group.

416

(fig. 5a). apparently, nam but not na is methylated by  xxxg1575xxx . this
agrees with the view that in vivo na must ﬁrst be converted to nam
before methylation occurs [15]. the direct contribution of  xxxg1575xxx 
to homocysteine synthesis and secretion from tissue samples was
examined by the use of the  xxxg1575xxx  inhibitor 1-methylnicotinamide
(1-mnm). the presence of 1-mnm reduced homocysteine secretion in wat by 50% suggesting a direct link between  xxxg1575xxx  enzyme
activity and homocysteine formation. homocysteine secretion from
liver samples was not signiﬁcantly affected by na, nam, or the
 xxxg1575xxx  inhibitor (fig. 5a).
finally, to estimate whether chronic na treatment causes hyperhomocysteinemia in mice, we measured the concentration of
homocysteine in plasma of na-treated and control mice. although
a trend of increased homocysteine plasma concentrations was
observed in treated versus untreated animals on a hf diet, the
difference did not reach statistical signiﬁcance (fig. 5b).
4. discussion
 xxxg1575xxx  is a major methyltransferase that converts nam into
n-methyl nam. the enzyme requires  xxxd3156xxx  as
methyl-donating cofactor and methyl transfer results in the generation of homocysteine. elevated homocysteine concentrations
in plasma promote atherosclerosis through increased oxidative
stress, impaired endothelial function, and induction of thrombosis [20,21]. accordingly, hyperhomocysteinemia is considered an
independent risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis.
to prevent the accumulation of excessive amounts of homocysteine in blood and tissues, homocysteine can be converted into
methionine by re-methylation mediated by  xxxg1479xxx .
this process depends on the availability of essential cofactors
including  xxxd2146xxx  and cobalamine. hyperhomocysteinemia is
most commonly caused by folate/ xxxd2716xxx  deﬁciencies, genetic
disorders lacking the participating enzymes (e.g., of n5, n10methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase), certain drugs, and renal
impairment [22]. for treatment,  xxxd2716xxx  supplementation represents an approved, efﬁcient, and safe homocysteine-lowering
therapy.
in the present study we show that murine and human adipose tissue as well as cultured adipocytes express high amounts
of  xxxg1575xxx .  xxxg1575xxx  mrna levels and activities increase markedly during the differentiation of 3t3-l1 ﬁbroblasts into adipocytes. high
 xxxg1575xxx  activity in adipocytes and adipose tissue suggested that an
increased methyl group turnover could result in elevated homocysteine production. consistent with this hypothesis, we found that
progressive differentiation of 3t3-l1 cells resulted in increased
homocysteine concentrations in cell culture supernatants. these
data also indicated that adipocytes are able to release the atherogenic metabolite homocysteine. similar results were obtained with
adipose tissue specimen from mice and humans. wat from both
species expressed high amounts of  xxxg1575xxx  mrna and enzyme
and murine wat released homocysteine into the tissue culture
medium. adipose homocysteine secretion decreased by 50% when
1-mnm was used to speciﬁcally inhibit  xxxg1575xxx  suggesting that
nearly half of the total homocysteine production in murine fat can
be attributed to the activity of  xxxg1575xxx . the other half is likely to
originate from the combined activity of other adenosylmethioninedependent methyltransferases. this signiﬁcant contribution of
 xxxg1575xxx  to homocysteine production is consistent with the recently
published genome-wide linkage scan [6] showing best association
of plasma homocysteine concentrations with the gene encoding
 xxxg1575xxx .
to evaluate the impact of adipose tissue mass on  xxxg1575xxx  expression, we performed a diet study. mice fed a hf diet for 4 months
were signiﬁcantly more obese than chow fed animals and concomi-

tantly exhibited higher  xxxg1575xxx  activity in wat. in analogy, one could
speculate that obese individuals would also express higher absolute
amounts of  xxxg1575xxx  resulting in the increased production of homocysteine. it is further conceivable that this mechanism contributes
to the increased cardiovascular risk of obese individuals.
in mice, a direct link between hepatic  xxxg1575xxx  activity and the susceptibility to atherosclerosis has been reported [23]. notably, the
average  xxxg1575xxx  activity among mouse strains varies dramatically
(up to 14-fold) and is associated with atherosclerosis susceptibility. for example, atherosclerosis resistant c3h/hej mice exhibit low,
whereas atherosclerosis-susceptible c57bl/6j mice exhibit high
hepatic  xxxg1575xxx  activity [23]. however, it would be interesting to
additionally determine the relative contribution of adipose  xxxg1575xxx 
activity to this overall risk of atherogenesis.
the endogenous substrate for  xxxg1575xxx  is nicotinamide (nam),
the amide of na. na, the common name for pyridine 3-carboxylic
acid, is a water-soluble member of the b complex of vitamins, also
known as  xxxd2715xxx . na is widely used as lipid-lowering drug.
pharmacological doses of na beneﬁcially affect the lipoprotein proﬁle by lowering atherogenic lipoproteins such as chylomicrones,
vldl, ldl, and lipoprotein(a) [24–26] and by substantially raising
the level of anti-atherogenic hdl, in particular hdl2 [27]. the hdlraising effect appears to be dependent on the activity of cholesteryl
ester transfer protein (cetp) because animal species that lack cetp
like mice do not show the beneﬁcial effect of na on hdl. in contrast,
when mice are “humanized” by the transgenic expression of human
cetp, hdl levels respond to na treatment [28]. na treatment is
known to increase plasma total homocysteine concentrations in
humans [18], but the biochemical mechanism remains undeﬁned,
because, at least in rats, changes in hepatic  xxxg1575xxx  regulation were
not observed in response to na treatment [29]. consistent with the
hypothesis that increased homocysteine production upon na treatment might be attributable to increased  xxxg1575xxx  activity in wat, we
were able to show that incubation of murine adipose tissue with
nam leads to increased release of homocysteine. the fact that direct
treatment of adipose tissue cultures with na failed to increase
homocysteine secretion indicates that the conversion of na to nam
in a region other than adipose tissue is required for this process. in
vivo, nam formation is likely to be accomplished by bioconversion
following oral administration.
interestingly, treatment of mice with na for 4 weeks significantly increased murine  xxxg1575xxx  activity in wat. this induction
appears to be regulated post-transcriptionally because  xxxg1575xxx 
mrna levels remain unchanged. hepatic  xxxg1575xxx  activity was not
signiﬁcantly affected by na treatment suggesting that the most of
nam is methylated by adipose  xxxg1575xxx . the crucial role of adipose
 xxxg1575xxx  in nam methylation is also supported by the high uptake
rates of na in murine adipose tissue [30]. high na uptake rates in
wat together with the fact that the total amount of human body
fat (7–18 kg) exceed the 1.5 kg of liver weight by approximately 10fold, suggest that the majority of na is initially transformed into
nam and subsequently methylated by adipose  xxxg1575xxx .
high  xxxg1575xxx  activity in wat accompanied by increased homocysteine production and release from wat might be an important
contributor to the adverse effect of na on plasma total homocysteine concentrations in patients treated for hyperlipidemia.
however, in mice na treatment resulted only in a minor, nonsigniﬁcant increase in plasma homocysteine levels despite high
 xxxg1575xxx  activities in wat. this indicates that in mice homocysteine
produced in response to na treatment is efﬁciently converted to
methionine by the  xxxd2716xxx -dependent  xxxg1479xxx . this
view is supported by the fact that our mice were kept on standard diets with a “high folate/high  xxxd2716xxx ” content. we assume
that increased plasma homocysteine levels in mice would only be
expected under a “low folate/low  xxxd2716xxx ” condition.

although basic research has already offered many pathways by
which hyperhomocysteinemia is supposed to favour the development of cardiovascular disease (as by protein homocysteinylation,
impairment of vasodilation or induction of oxidant stress as well as
of inﬂammation and thrombosis) [31,32], clinical studies were very
heterogenous and so far failed to prove a direct causal relationship
[33]. the association between elevated plasma homocysteine levels and cardiovascular disease has been shown for several times,
but the question still remains whether it is a cause or just a marker
[34]. in light of our data, which deﬁne adipose tissue as inducible
source of homocysteine, homocysteine levels (in our case) do not
seem to be a marker for existing atherosclerosis but rather argue
for a causal relationship. but apart from common homocysteine
effects which might be directly involved in the development of
atherosclerosis, it was recently shown that hyperhomocysteinemia
also leads to insulin- and leptin resistance [35–37] favouring the
development of obesity which could in turn facilitate the development of atherosclerosis. thus, homocysteine seems to generate
another link between obesity and atherosclerosis.
in conclusion, our experiments deﬁne a crucial role of adipose
 xxxg1575xxx  in the methylation of nam and the concomitant generation
of homocysteine. accordingly, wat may contribute a signiﬁcant
proportion to the body homocysteine pool and adipose  xxxg1575xxx  may
be an additional target for homocysteine-lowering therapies.
