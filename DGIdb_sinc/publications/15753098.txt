nad is an essential cofactor for both energy metabolism and
signal transduction similar to dual functional nucleotides, atp
and gtp. the role of nad acting on redox equilibrium in
metabolism has been well known in processes such as dna
repair and calcium-dependent signaling pathways (1). nad is
synthesized via two major pathways in both prokaryotic and
eukaryotic organisms. in one pathway, nad is synthesized
from tryptophan, a de novo pathway (2), and in the other, nad

is generated by recycling degraded nad products such as nicotinamide, referred to as the salvage pathway (3). the three
precursors, quinolinate (qa),1 nicotinate (na), and nicotinamide (nam), can be transferred onto  xxxd2937xxx  ( xxxd2937xxx ) by the respective phosphoribosyl transferase
(fig. 1). the resulting mononucleotides,  xxxd323xxx  or  xxxd2715xxx  mononucleotide (namn), are converted into the corresponding dinucleotides, nad or nicotinic
acid adenine dinucleotide, by  xxxd323xxx  adenylyltransferase (4). finally,  xxxd2715xxx  adenine dinucleotide is amidated to nad by nad synthase.
surprisingly, increasing the activity of nad biosynthetic
enzymes has recently been demonstrated to extend life span (5,
6). overexpression of enzymes of the nad biosynthetic pathway such as  xxxg1502xxx  ( xxxg1502xxx ),
nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase, or nicotinamidase in yeast results in higher activity of the nad-dependent
histone deacetylase sir2p and concomitant life span extension
(7–9).
 xxxg1502xxx  is a facultative atpase that couples atp hydrolysis and nucleotide formation in the salvage pathway (3). the
 xxxg1502xxx  from salmonella typhimurium (stnaprtase) catalyzes namn formation without atp but accelerates the reaction 10 –30-fold in its presence (10). a low affinity form of
stnaprtase is phosphorylated by atp followed by conversion
to a high affinity form binding substrates and producing
namn. the covalently phosphorylated site, his219, is converted to a labile 1-phosphohistidine by atp (11).
to elucidate the molecular function of  xxxg1502xxx , we have
determined the crystal structures of native and substratebound forms of an  xxxg1502xxx  homologue from thermoplasma
acidophilum (tanaprtase, gi: 16082162). in the pfam data
base (12), tanaprtase belongs to pfam04095 together with
stnaprtase and ecnaprtase ( xxxg1502xxx  from escherichia
coli). the tanaprtase also shows strong sequence homology
to pre-b-cell colony-enhancing factor (pbef), one of the members of pfam04095 (fig. 2a). the murine homologue of the
previously identified human pbef gene coding for a putative
cytokine has been identified as a nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (namprtase), indicating that nad biosynthesis
may play an important role in lymphocyte activation (13). the

we have determined the crystal structure of  xxxg1502xxx  from themoplasma acidophilum (tanaprtase). the tanaprtase has three
domains, an n-terminal domain, a central functional domain, and a unique c-terminal domain. the crystal
structure revealed that the functional domain has a type
ii phosphoribosyltransferase fold that may be a common
architecture for both  xxxd2715xxx  and quinolinic acid
(qa) phosphoribosyltransferases (prtase) despite low
sequence similarity between them. unlike  xxxg1913xxx ,
tanaprtase has a unique extra c-terminal domain
containing a zinc knuckle-like motif containing 4 cysteines. the tanaprtase forms a trimer of dimers in the
crystal. the active site pocket is formed at dimer interfaces. the complex structures with  xxxd2937xxx  ( xxxd2937xxx ) and nicotinate mononucleotide
(namn) showed, surprisingly, that functional residues
lining on the active site of tanaprtase are quite different from those of  xxxg1913xxx , although their substrates are quite similar to each other. the phosphate
moiety of  xxxd2937xxx  and namn is anchored to the phosphate-binding loops formed by backbone amides, as
found in many ␣/␤ barrel enzymes. the pyrophosphate
moiety of  xxxd2937xxx  is located at the entrance of the active
site pocket, whereas the nicotinate moiety of namn is
located deep inside. interestingly, the nicotinate moiety
of namn is intercalated between highly conserved aromatic residues tyr21 and phe138. careful structural analyses combined with other  xxxg1502xxx  sequence subfamilies reveal that tanaprtase represents a unique
sequence subfamily of  xxxg1502xxx . the structures of
tanaprtase also provide valuable insight for other sequence subfamilies such as pre-b cell colony-enhancing
factor, known to have nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase activity.

materials and methods

cloning of tanaprtase—the sequence encoding tanaprtase was
amplified by the pcr from t. acidophilum genomic dna (american
type culture collection, manassas, va) using deep vent dna polymerase (new england biolabs, beverly, ma). the resulting pcr product
was purified and prepared for ligation-independent cloning (14) by
treatment with t4 dna polymerase in the presence of 1 mm dttp for
30 min at 37 °c. the prepared dna was then mixed with the vector  xxxd1498xxx 
for 5 min at room temperature and transformed into dh5␣. this  xxxd1498xxx 
vector was designed in our laboratory to express the target protein
together with an n-terminal his6 tag-maltose-binding protein fusion
containing a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. clones were
screened by plasmid dna analysis and transformed into bl21(de3)/
psjs1244 for protein expression (15).
protein expression, purification, and crystallization—a  xxxd3187xxx  derivative of the protein was expressed in a methionine auxotroph, e. coli strain b834(de3)/psjs1244 (15), grown in pasm medium 2 supplied with  xxxd3187xxx  (16). cells were disrupted by
microfluidization (microfluidics, newton, ma) in 50 mm hepes, ph 7,
500 mm nacl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 ␮g/ml dnase, 0.1
␮g/ml antipain, 1 ␮g/ml chymostatin, 0.5 ␮g/ml leupeptin, and 0.7
␮g/ml pepstatin a, and cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at
10,000 rpm for 20 min in a sorvall centrifuge. the supernatant was
then spun in a beckman ultracentrifuge ti45 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 30
min at 4 °c. the fusion protein was affinity-purified using two 5-ml
hitrap chelating hp columns (amersham biosciences). the fusion
protein was bound to the column in 5% glycerol, 50 mm hepes, ph 7.0,
500 mm nacl and was eluted with a gradient of 4 –300 mm imidazole in
10 column volumes. fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight at
room temperature against 50 mm hepes, ph 7.0, 0.1 m nacl, 5 mm
␤- xxxd26xxx , and 10 mm imidazole in the presence of tobacco etch
virus protease. after centrifugation, the supernatant was applied onto
a 5-ml hitrap metal chelating (ni2⫹) column. the cleaved recombinant
protein was found in the flow-through. further purification was performed with size-exclusion chromatography in 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5,
and 300 mm nacl. sds-page showed one band ⬃ 43 kda, corresponding to the molecular mass of tanaprtase. the protein was concentrated to 8.1 mg/ml for crystallization. dynamic light scattering (dynapro 99, wyatt technology corp., santa barbara, ca) showed a
polydisperse peak, indicating the presence of an oligomeric form
of tanaprtase.
screening for crystallization conditions was performed using the
sparse matrix method (17) with several screens from hampton research (hampton research, laguna niquel, ca) and the wizard screen
(decode genetics, bainbridge island, wa). the crystallization robot

“hydra plus-one” (matrix technologies, hudson, nh) was used to set
the screens using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at room
temperature.
in the optimized crystallization conditions, 1 ␮l of protein solution
was mixed with 1 ␮l of the well solution containing 0.2 m ammonium
acetate, 0.1 m tris-hcl, ph 8.5, 45% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, using
the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. a thin rod crystal grew in a
week to approximate dimensions of 0.08 ⫻ 0.02 ⫻ 0.02 mm3. the
 xxxd2937xxx -bound complex was obtained by soaking a crystal with 10 mm
 xxxd2937xxx  for 12 h.
when crystals are grown in 2.4 m sodium malonate at ph 7.0, the
electron density map showed the presence of partially occupied namn.
interestingly, the addition of 10 mm nicotinate for 12 h clearly showed
a fully occupied namn bound in the structure.
data collection and reduction—the crystal grown in the first crystallization solution was soaked in a drop of mother liquor containing 5
mm k2ircl6 for 12 h and then transferred to mother liquor with 10%
glycerol before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and used for x-ray
data collection. x-ray diffraction data to 2.8 å were collected at a single
wavelength (1.10490 å, table i) of iridium absorption peak at the
macromolecular crystallography facility beamline 5.0.2 at the advanced light source at lawrence berkeley national laboratory using
an area detector system co. (poway, ca) quantum 4 ccd detector
placed 250 mm from the sample. the oscillation range per image was
1.0° with no overlap between two contiguous images. x-ray diffraction
data were processed and scaled using denzo and scalepack from
the hkl program suite (18). the data sets for the complex crystals with
 xxxd2937xxx  and namn were collected to 2.75 and 2.65 å, respectively. data
statistics are summarized in table i.
structure determination and refinement—one major and two minor
iridium positions were located using the program solve (19) with
figure of merit 0.22 at 2.9 å resolution. the initial single-wavelength
anomalous dispersion phases were further improved by solvent flattening using the program resolve (19). the best interpretable map was
found from 20.0 to 2.9 å resolution data with figure of merit 0.55. there
was one molecule in the asymmetric unit, and a model was built using
the program o (20) with the aid of secondary structure prediction from
psipred (21). the preliminary model was then refined using the
program cns (22). the reflections in this data set between 20.0 and 2.8
å were included throughout the refinement calculations. ten percent of
the data were randomly chosen for free r-factor cross validation. the
refinement statistics are shown in table ii. isotropic b-factors for
individual atoms were initially fixed to 20 å2 and were refined in the
last stages. the 2fo ⫺ fc and fo ⫺ fc maps were used for manual
rebuilding between refinement cycles and for the location of solvent
molecules. two complex structures containing  xxxd2937xxx  and namn were
solved at 2.75 and 2.65, respectively. atomic coordinates of the three
structures have been deposited in the protein data bank (pdb) with
the accession code of 1ytd, 1yte, and 1ytk, respectively.

results and discussion

quality of the model and overall structure—the final model
of the native crystal structure includes 389 out of 393 residues.
the final models have been refined at 2.8 å resolution to a
crystallographic r-factor of 19.8% and free r-factor of 24.6%
(fig. 3). the averaged b-factors for main chain atoms and side
chain atoms are 43.6 and 47.4 å2, respectively. in the tanaprtase models, 3 c-terminal residues are undefined in the
electron density map. table ii summarizes the refinement
statistics as well as model quality parameters. all residues lie
in the allowed region of the ␾ ⫺ ␸ plot produced with procheck (23).
the c␣ trace of the atomic model of tanaprtase is shown
in fig. 4a. the monomer has approximate dimensions of
80 å ⫻ 55 å ⫻ 25 å. tanaprtase consists of three domains, an
n-terminal ␣ ⫹ ␤ domain, a central ␣/␤ domain, and a cterminal domain containing a zinc knuckle-like domain. the
three dimers form a hexamer with a circular ring structure in
the unit cell (fig. 4, b–d). the thickness of the ring is about 50
å, and the approximate diameters inside and outside of the
ring are 35 and 90 å, respectively. the presence of quaternary
structures is supported by results from a dynamic light scattering experiment indicating the presence of several oligomeric
states of tanaprtase in solution (data not shown). the surface area of tanaprtase buried by dimer formation is very
large (per monomer ⬃2,730 å2). interestingly, the major interaction at the dimeric interface is ionic rather than hydrophobic,
as usually found in dimeric proteins. the interaction between
dimers (⬃1,950 å2/dimer) that results in a hexameric state in
the crystal structure is also ionic. therefore, the oligomeric
states can be achieved or destroyed depending on surrounding

conditions influencing these ionic interactions such as ph, salt,
or protein concentration. the result from a size-exclusion column in high salt conditions proved that tanaprtase could be
present as a monomer (see “materials and methods”). a similar
hexamer formation by three dimers dependent on high protein
concentration or ionic strength has been reported based on the
crystal structure of  xxxg1913xxx  from mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtqaprtase) (24). the major interaction at the dimeric
interface of the mtqaprtase is also ionic rather than
hydrophobic.
the final models of a namn-bound and  xxxd2937xxx -bound structures have been determined at 2.65 and 2.75 å, respectively.
the difference fourier maps were used to build substrate models. in the  xxxd2937xxx -bound structure, the electron density of a
pyrophosphate moiety was weak (fig. 3a). this might be the
result of the lack of  xxxd2531xxx  known to bind with  xxxd2937xxx .

parameters. all residues lie in the allowed region of the ␾ ⫺ ␸

arg105⬘, arg136, arg139, lys140, his161, arg162, lys172, and
his274; 3) tanaprtase has four basic redues, arg141, arg142,
his182, and arg235. interestingly, there is no conserved residue
detected in the active site pockets between tanaprtase and
the two qaprtases.
structural comparison of  xxxd2937xxx -bound forms—for the
transfer of the phosphoribosyl group,  xxxd2937xxx  must bind to the
enzyme. in type i phosphoribosyltransferases, there are three
conserved motifs forming a  xxxd2937xxx -binding site (27). however,
tanaprtase has a type ii phosphoribosyltransferase fold not
having these motifs, as first shown in the stqaprtase structure. the structural comparison was done between prppbound tanaprtase and 5-phosphoribosyl-1-(␤-methylene) pyrophosphate (a  xxxd2937xxx  analog) -bound mtqaprtase. in both
structures, the phosphate group of  xxxd2937xxx  binds to a common
phosphate-binding motif of many ␣/␤ barrel enzymes and  xxxg1913xxx  (28). it is known that the phosphate group is bound
between the c-terminal ends of the final two ␤-strands of the
␣/␤ barrel, created by residues of the loop between ␤-strand 7
(␤11 in the case of tanaprtase) and ␣-helix 7 (h10) and the
n terminus of the additional helix 8⬘ (h11) of conventional ␣/␤
barrel structures (fig. 6a). although the sequence similarity
among the phosphate-binding motifs is poor, the structures
overlay in quite a striking manner. there is almost no conservation of the basic residues that coordinate the phosphate
group. the important driving force of phosphate binding is due
to main chain amides similar to the oxyanion hole formed by a
glycine rich motif as shown in the carboxylesterase structure
(29). two conserved motifs, 269hsggh273 (h stands for hydrophobic residue) and 290gvgxx294 (figs. 2b and 6b), serve to
accommodate the phosphate group of  xxxd2937xxx .
the comparison of the two complex structures revealed that
pyrophosphate moieties are located at the entrance of the active site pocket. however, their specific position and interacting residues are quite different between tanaprtase and
mtqaprtase, as shown in fig. 6b. in the case of mtqaprtase, although there are few directly interacting residues,
several charged residues (arg48⬘, arg105⬘, glu104⬘, asp173,
glu201, and asp222) are located to help charged interaction.
however, tanaprtase has few charged residues, asp237 and
asp302⬘, located around  xxxd2937xxx , but ser240 from the
235
rldtpssrrg244 motif (fig. 2b) strongly interacts with
 xxxd2937xxx  (fig. 3a).
the comparison of native and  xxxd2937xxx  complex structures of
tanaprtase shows no significant conformational changes. as

prtase (fig. 5a), despite the low sequence similarity between
 xxxg1502xxx  and  xxxg1913xxx  (fig. 2a). the n-terminal domain of
tanaprtase is composed of a ␤-sheet stacked with four ␣-helices having an ␣-␤ plait topology similar to that of mtqaprtase. however, the following differences are observed. 1)
the n-terminal antiparallel ␤-sheet of tanaprtase is composed of six ␤-strands instead of the four found in mtqaprtase by adding extra two ␤-strands from the c-terminal
domain; 2) the starting region of the n terminus is composed of
a loop and a short ␣-helix involved in dimeric interaction,
unlike the long n-terminal helix of mtqaprtase not involved
in dimeric interaction.
the seven ␤-stranded ␣/␤ barrel structure of the central
domain of tanaprtase has been first observed in  xxxg1913xxx 
from s. typhimurium (stqaprtase) known as the type ii
phosphoribosyltransferase fold (26). this is a unique fold with
an approximate topology of ␣␤ ␣␤ (␤␣)4␤, unlike the conventional topology of (␣/␤)8. however, some deviations are observed in the tanaprtase structure. 1) an extra ␣-helix h6 is
present between ␤7 and h7; 2) the loop between h6 and h7
does not form a part of the ␤-barrel due to the large gap with
␤8. as a result, the actual topology is ␣␤ ␣␤ ␣2(␤␣)3␤ instead of
␣␤ ␣␤ (␤␣)4␤.
active site comparison between tanaprtase and qaprtases— xxxg1502xxx  and  xxxg1913xxx  use the same substrate,  xxxd2937xxx ,
to transfer the phosphoribosyl group and use na and qa,
respectively, to produce namn. the comparison of the three
active sites of tanaprtase and two qaprtases, stqaprtase
and ecqaprtase, revealed that the shape and the size of the
active site pocket (⬃8 ⫻ 12 å) are strongly correlated with the
shape and size of the final product, namn. the active site
pockets are confined by the other dimer subunit. the dimerization is thought to be important in increasing substrate specificity and the proper functioning of tanaprtase as shown in
the two  xxxg1913xxx  structures.
except for the dimension of the active sites, other characteristics of the active sites are quite different between tanaprtase and the two qaprtases. the qa-bound structures of
the two qaprtases showed the presence of a strongly positively charged cleft inside the active site pocket to accommodate two carboxylate moieties of qa (24). however, in tanaprtase, the active site pocket itself is not so basic due to the
presence of a relatively high content of hydrophobic and aromatic residues. the basic residues lining the active site pockets
are as follows. 1) stqaprtase has 8 basic residues, arg118⬘
(from the other subunit), arg152, lys153, arg159, lys163, his174,

motif may be unique to tanaprtase. in the tertiary and
quaternary structure of tanaprtase, this motif does not interact with any other domains, unlike that of the dna replication initiator.
comparison of tanaprtase with other homologues using
sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction—
 xxxg1502xxx  has been identified in many species from bacteria to
human. in the pfam data base (12), tanaprtase, stnaprtase, ecnaprtase, and pbef belong to pfam04095. in
the ncbi cdd data base (31), they are categorized in different
subfamilies. tanaprtase belongs to cd01571 (called
 xxxg1502xxx  subgroup b), stnaprtase belongs to cd01401
(called pncb_like), and pbef to cd01569 (called pbef_like).
to infer the structural properties of these subfamilies, sequence alignments and secondary structure predictions have
been performed and compared with those of tanaprtase. as
expected, overall structure is predicted to be quite similar (fig.
2a). in particular, the functionally important type ii phosphoribosyltransferase fold is predicted to be present in all the
members. the ␣/␤ barrel domain is apparent in the secondary
structure predictions.
 xxxg1502xxx  has atpase activity even if it is not essential for
a function. stnaprtase clearly showed the presence of a phosphorylated intermediate after atp hydrolysis (11). his219 is
phosphorylated and converted to phosphohistidine (11). the
sequence alignment shows that his219 is not conserved in tanaprtase and pbef subfamilies (fig. 2a). therefore, it is not
clear whether the formation of a phosphohistidine is the common property of all naprtases or not. if this is the case, his182
from the 178gtmph182 motif of tanaprtase is one of the
candidates for a phosphorylation site because it is located at
the active site pocket.
recently, pbef from murine has been identified as an namprtase (13). the namprtase function is predicted to originate from a type ii phosphoribosyltransferase fold, as discussed above. the sequence alignment shows that the
nicotinate-binding residues and phosphate moiety of prppbinding motifs are more similar to those of tanaprtase. in
the ncbi cdd data base, tanaprtase (the  xxxg1502xxx  subgroup b) sequence family is closer to the pbef sequence family
than to the pncb_like sequence family. however, pbef has a
longer n-terminal domain similar to pncb_like and has several
insertions not found in other subfamilies. therefore, the crystal

 xxxd2937xxx ; namn is located inside the cavity instead of the entrance (fig. 6). however, the phosphate group of namn is
located in approximately the same position as that of  xxxd2937xxx .
therefore, the architecture for accommodating the phosphate
moiety of  xxxd2937xxx  and namn may be critical for enzyme function. the ribosylnicotinate moiety of namn swings from outside to inside as compared with the ribosylpyrophosphate moiety of  xxxd2937xxx .
to accommodate the two carboxylate groups of qa, stqaprtase has 5 basic residues (arg118⬘, arg152, lys153, his174,
and arg175) lining the deep active site pocket (26). mtqaprtase has 4 (arg136, arg139, his161, and arg162) in the deep
active site pocket to accommodate the qa and na moiety of
namn (24). tanaprtase has only one basic residue, arg235,
in the deep active site. however, to compensate the weak basic
potential in the deep active site, tanaprtase employs a different strategy to deal with the same product. in addition to
specific binding of namn to arg235 from the 235rldtssrrg244 motif and hydrogen bond with thr179 of the 178gtmph182 motif, the aromatic ring of na intercalates between
the highly conserved aromatic resides tyr21⬘ and phe138 (figs.
2b and 3b). the distances between these aromatic rings are
around 4 å, the general distance of stacked base pairs in dna.
therefore, tanaprtase uses a stacking effect as a driving
force to accommodate na.
c-terminal unique zinc finger domain—the c-terminal domain (299 –393) of tanaprtase is composed of seven
␤-strands followed by the terminal ␣-helix ( xxxg1956xxx ). the first two
␤-strands and the last ␤-strand formed a six-stranded ␤-sheet
with three n-terminal ␤-strands. the next four ␤-strands form
a zinc knuckle-like structure formed by the 4 cysteines, cys330,
cys333, cys348, and cys350. however, there is no zinc atom in
the center of the 4 cysteines. a dali search (25) with the
c-terminal domain shows the highest similarity with a dna
replication initiator from methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (z ⫽ 2.1; root mean square deviations of 2.7 å for 39
pairs of aligned c␣ atoms; 1ltl-a). interestingly, the aligned 39
c␣ atoms of the dna replication initiator is composed of a zinc
knuckle structure (fig. 7). this zinc finger domain of the dna
replication initiator is involved in a unique dodecamerization
interaction rather than a functional activity (30).
the psi-blast search with the c-terminal sequence
showed that the cxxc(x)14cxc motif is unique and is not
conserved in  xxxg1502xxx  subfamily. therefore, the role of this

crystal structure of  xxxg1502xxx 
show that tanaprtase, pbef, and pncb_like subfamilies
have their unique sequence motifs and structural properties for
their specific function, although they share a common fold and
function.
in summary, the first crystal structure of an  xxxg1502xxx 
family member is presented in this study. the presence of the
type ii phosphoribosyltransferase fold in the tanaprtase
structure together with bound  xxxd2937xxx  and namn complex
structures helps to explain the  xxxg1502xxx  function of this
family at a molecular level. the application of structural information to analyze subfamilies gives an insight for finding common as well as unique properties of each subfamily. thus, the
crystal structure of tanaprtase provides a structural framework for understanding the molecular functions of all members
of  xxxg1502xxx  family.
