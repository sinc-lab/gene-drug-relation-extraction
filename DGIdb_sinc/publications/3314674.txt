 xxxg730xxx  and binding site for  xxxd2041xxx  in metastatic malignant melanoma.  enzyme immuno assay (eia) of  xxxg730xxx  (er) has confirmed the results of earlier investigations using steroid binding techniques, namely that er is present at very low concentrations in samples from metastatic melanoma. thirty-four of 61 samples (56%) were er positive with eia. the corresponding figures using isoelectric focusing (if) for the steroid binding assay were 16 of these 61 samples (26%). the difference between the methods may be due to difficulties in the interpretation of analytical results for if at low er concentration levels or to interference from other 3h-estradiol binding components.  xxxd2041xxx  binding site (embs) has been found in samples from 15 of 77 patients (20%) with if in polyacrylamide gels.  xxxd2041xxx  is, together with  xxxd2041xxx , the cytotoxic metabolite of  xxxd2042xxx  (estracyt). in analogy to the previously suggested therapeutic significance of  xxxd2041xxx  binding protein in the treatment of prostatic cancer, the clinical importance of  xxxd2042xxx  should also be studied in metastatic malignant melanoma in correlation with embs status.
