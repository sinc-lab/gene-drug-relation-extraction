abstract: human  xxxg350xxx  is a heme protein that catalyzes the condensation of serine
and homocysteine to form cystathionine in a  xxxd3047xxx -dependent reaction. mutations in this
enzyme are the leading cause of hereditary hyperhomocysteinemia with attendant cardiovascular and other
complications. the enzyme is activated ∼2-fold by the allosteric regulator  xxxd3156xxx  ( xxxd3156xxx ),
which is presumed to bind to the c-terminal regulatory domain. the regulatory domain exerts an inhibitory
effect on the enzyme, and its deletion is correlated with a 2-fold increase in catalytic activity and loss of
responsiveness to  xxxd3156xxx . a mutation in the c-terminal regulatory domain, d444n, displays high levels
of enzyme activity, yet is pathogenic. in this study, we have characterized the biochemical penalties
associated with this mutation and demonstrate that it is associated with a 4-fold lower steady-state level
of  xxxg350xxx  in a fibroblast cell line that is homozygous for the d444n mutation. the
activity of the recombinant d444n enzyme mimics the activity of the wild-type enzyme seen in the presence
of  xxxd3156xxx  and can be further activated ∼2-fold in the presence of supraphysiolgical concentrations of
the allosteric regulator. the mutation increases the kact for  xxxd3156xxx  from 7.4 ( 0.2 to 460 ( 130 µm,
thus rendering the enzyme functionally unresponsive to  xxxd3156xxx  under physiological concentrations. these
results indicate that the d444n mutation partially abrogates the intrasteric inhibition imposed by the
c-terminal domain. we propose a model that takes into account the three kinetically distinguishable states
that are observed with human  xxxg350xxx : “basal” (i.e., wild-type enzyme as isolated),
“activated” (wild-type enzyme +  xxxd3156xxx  or the d444n mutant as isolated), and superactivated (d444n
mutant +  xxxd3156xxx  or wild-type enzyme lacking the c-terminal regulatory domain).

mutations in human  xxxg350xxx  are the single
most common cause of hereditary hyperhomocysteinemia in
which circulating levels of homocysteine are severely
elevated (1).  xxxg350xxx  deficiency presents
pleiotropic clinical symptoms, and four major organ systems
are affected. the clinical manifestations include ectopia
lentis, skeletal deformities, mental retardation, and vascular
disease with life-threatening thromboembolisms (2). over
100 mutations, mostly private, have been described in
 xxxg350xxx  deficient patients and are dispersed
over the entire length of the coding sequence (3).
 xxxg350xxx  catalyzes the condensation of
homocysteine and serine to give cystathionine and represents
one of two major metabolic routes for the removal of
homocysteine. mildly elevated homocysteine is a risk factor
for cardiovascular diseases and is also correlated with neural
tube defects and alzheimer’s disease (4-6). the enzyme is
a unique heme protein that requires the cofactor pyridoxal

phosphate (plp)1 and is activated by the allosteric effector
 xxxd3156xxx . the human enzyme is a homotetramer composed
of subunits with a molecular mass of 63 kda. it appears to
have a modular organization in which n-terminal, middle,
and c-terminal regions of the protein represent the binding
sites for heme, plp, and  xxxd3156xxx , respectively (figure 1)
(7). limited proteolysis results in the separation of the
n-terminal “catalytic core” from the c-terminal  xxxd3156xxx 
regulatory domain (8). the catalytic core (referred to as the
∆c143 form of the enzyme) retains high levels of activity
but loses sensitivity to  xxxd3156xxx  (7). the crystal structure of
the catalytic core has been reported recently (9, 10).
the structure of the full-length enzyme or of the cterminal regulatory domain is not available. however,
residues 415-468 within this domain are predicted to adopt
a beta-r-beta-beta-r fold-containing “cbs” domain, which is
found in a diverse set of proteins including  xxxd557xxx  dehydrogenase, 5′-amp activated protein kinase,
chloride channels, and abc transporters (11). the role of
the cbs domain in these proteins is not known, and it is
postulated to provide binding sites for effector molecules
and/or to play a targeting role for compartmental localization.

intrasteric regulation by a domain in the protein that can
reversibly modulate the activity of the catalytic domain has
been well studied in protein kinase c (12). in cystathionine
beta-synthase, the c-terminal regulatory domain plays an
important, but as yet poorly understood, role in modulating
activity. in addition to harboring the presumed binding site
for  xxxd3156xxx , it also appears to inhibit enzyme activity. the
catalytic core of the protein (∆c143) lacking the c-terminal
domain displays a 2-fold and ∼4-fold higher kcat than the
full-length enzyme in the presence and absence of  xxxd3156xxx ,
respectively. curiously, deletion of the c-terminal domain
alleviates the catalytic penalties associated with several
missense mutations in the catalytic core of the protein and
points to its importance in activities other than  xxxd3156xxx 
binding (13).
despite the relatively large number of missense mutations
that have been described in homocystinuric patients with
impaired  xxxg350xxx  activity, the biochemical
penalties associated with very few of these have been
characterized (14-16). the point mutation d444n was the
first regulatory domain mutation to be characterized (17).
in escherichia coli cell extracts the activity associated with
the recombinant d444n protein was found to be comparable
to that of the wild-type enzyme. however, the enzyme was
unresponsive to  xxxd3156xxx  at the concentrations that were
tested. in this study, we have examined the biochemical
characteristics associated with this mutation with purified
recombinant protein and in a patient fibroblast cell line that
is homozygous for the d444n expressing allele. we report
that the mutation reduces the steady-state levels of the protein
4-fold and drastically increases the kact for  xxxd3156xxx  (by
∼100-fold) so that it can no longer be activated at physiological concentrations of this effector. the combination of
these effects explains the diminished  xxxg350xxx 
activity observed in fibroblast extracts and is likely to account
for the homocystinuric phenotype associated with this
genotype. these studies provide interesting insights into the
role of the c-terminal domain in intrasteric regulation of the
n-terminal catalytic core.

enzyme assays and kinetic studies. specific activity was
measured using the fixed-time radiolabeled assay described
previously (18) except that 30 mm d,l-homocysteine was
employed instead of 15 mm l-homocysteine. the use of the
d,l-mixture versus the l-isomer generated by hydrolysis of
l-homocysteine thiolactone does not appear to affect enzyme
activity. reactions were initiated by addition of homocysteine. protein concentrations were determined by the bradford method (bio-rad) with bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a
standard. heme concentration was determined by the pyridine
hemochrome assay as described previously (19). plp was
measured fluorometrically using a modification of a published procedure (20) as described previously (7). co binding
studies were performed as described before (21).
thermal denaturation assays. the purified recombinant
enzymes were diluted to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml
with  xxxd3449xxx , ph 8.6. the enzyme solution was warmed
directly in a 1 ml quartz cuvette in a water-jacketed holder
connected to a thermostated water bath. the temperature was
raised from 30 to 65 °c in 5 °c increments, and the sample
was maintained at the desired temperature for 5 min to
achieve thermal equilibration. uv-visible absorption spectra
were recorded between 345 and 445 nm, and the values at
the soret aborption peak at 429 nm were plotted against the
respective temperatures.
cell culture. the human fibroblast cell line homozygous
for the d444n expressing allele of  xxxg350xxx 
was from a dutch patient as described (17). the  xxxg1479xxx 
fibroblast cell line wg1892, purchased from the repository
for mutant human cells, montreal children’s hospital, was
used as a control. cells were grown in 100 × 15 mm tissue
culture dishes in mem supplemented with 10% antimycotic,
10% v/v fetal bovine serum, and 2.2 g/l sodium bicarbonate
until they reached 60-80% confluency. the culture medium
was changed every 4 days.

on ice for 30 min. cell membranes were separated by
centrifugation at 14000g for 10 min at 4 °c, and the
supernatant was used for western analysis.
cell lysates containing 15 µg of protein were electrophoresed on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel under denaturing
conditions and transferred to an immuno-blot poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane.  xxxg350xxx  was
detected using a primary antibody to  xxxg350xxx 
at a 1:500 dilution and a secondary antibody (horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit igg) diluted 5000fold. chemiluminescent detection was performed using the

results
purification and kinetic properties of the d444n mutant.
the recombinant d444n mutant was purified using the
procedure developed for the wild-type enzyme (18). the
specific activity of the mutant in the absence of  xxxd3156xxx 
was 237 µmol h-1 (mg of protein)-1 at 37 °c and is 1.5fold higher than that of wild-type enzyme under the same
conditions [159 µmol h-1 (mg of protein)-1]. the km’s for
the substrates, serine and homocysteine, were unaffected, and
the heme and plp contents of the mutant and wild-type
enzymes were identical (data not shown). the spectrum of
the enzyme as isolated was of ferric heme with a soret
absorption maximum at 428 nm which shifted to 448 nm on
reduction with dithionite (figure 2), as reported previously
for the wild-type enzyme (18). denaturation of the enzyme
can be monitored by changes in the heme absorption
spectrum, which diminishes in intensity across the entire

spectral range (not shown) and is inconsistent with a change
in the axial ligation state as suggested previously (15). the
denaturation profiles for the wild-type enzyme and the
d444n mutant were identical, as shown in figure 3, and
did not exhibit the multiphasic behavior (initial decrease
followed by an increase which is likely to have been
contributed by turbidity) reported previously (15). the soret
absorption remained fairly constant up to 48 °c and
diminished linearly in intensity above that temperature.
the native molecular masses of the d444n and wild-type
enzymes were found to be identical. each showed a broad
elution profile when separated by hplc on a gel filtration
column. this has been seen previously for the wild-type
enzyme separated by fplc on a superose 12 column, in
which the peak of the broad elution band was consistent with
the presence of a tetramer (18).
 xxxd3156xxx  responsiveness of d444n versus wild-type
 xxxg350xxx . under the standard assay conditions, 380 µm  xxxd3156xxx  is added to the reaction mixture and
elicits an ∼2-fold increase in activity with the wild-type
enzyme and resulted in a slightly more modest 1.5-fold
increase in the d444n mutant. since the activity of this
mutant was reported to be unresponsive to  xxxd3156xxx  in cell
extracts up to a concentration of 200 µm  xxxd3156xxx , we
decided to further investigate the altered response of the
mutant. the concentration dependence for  xxxd3156xxx  activation
for wild-type and d444n enzymes is compared in figure 4.
in contrast to the wild-type enzyme, which is reported to
have a kact for  xxxd3156xxx  of 7.4 µm (7), the d444n mutant
showed a modest response up to a concentration of ∼200
µm  xxxd3156xxx . beyond this, the activity increased linearly and
doubled at 1 mm  xxxd3156xxx . the kact for  xxxd3156xxx  for the
d444n mutant was estimated to be 460 ( 130 µm.

binding isotherm with kd’s of 1.5 ( 0.1 and 68 ( 14 µm,
respectively (21). binding of co to the ferrous form of the
d444n mutant was characterized as shown in figure 2. as
with the wild-type enzyme, binding of co resulted in a blue
shift in the soret peak from 448 to 422 nm. two distinct
binding isotherms were also observed with the d444n

characterization of d444n  xxxg350xxx  in
a patient fibroblast cell line. the high level of enzyme
activity associated with the d444n mutant even in the
absence of  xxxd3156xxx  begs the question as to why the mutation
is correlated with hyperhomocysteinemia in the homozygous
state. to address this question, the steady-state mrna and
enzyme levels in a fibroblast cell line homozygous for the
d444n-encoding allele were compared to that of a control
cell line. as shown in figure 5a, northern blot analysis
revealed comparable levels of cystathionine beta-synthasespecific mrna in both patient and control cell lines. in
contrast, western blot analysis revealed a 4-fold lower level
of  xxxg350xxx  in the patient cell line (figure
5b).
discussion
the d444n mutation was the first c-terminal regulatory
mutant to be described in a homocystinuric patient (17).
 xxxg350xxx  activity in cultured fibroblasts from
a patient who is homozygous for this mutation has been
reported to lie in the range that is usually seen in heterozygotes in contrast to the severely elevated homocysteine levels
that were observed in this patient. furthermore, although the
1330a f g transition in  xxxg350xxx  encoding
the d444n missense mutation was associated with severe
hyperhomocysteinemia, the activity associated with the
recombinant enzyme in e. coli cell extracts was comparable
to that of the wild-type enzyme (17). however, the recombinant mutant showed only a modest increase in activity in
the presence of up to 200 µm  xxxd3156xxx , in contrast to the
wild-type enzyme that showed a 2-fold increase (17). these
observations are enigmatic and raise the following question.
why is loss of allosteric regulation by  xxxd3156xxx  in the face
of higher basal activity in the d444n mutant versus wildtype enzyme pathogenic? to address this question, we have
examined the biochemical properties associated with this
mutation in a fibroblast cell line and with the purified
recombinant protein.

upper: total cellular rna (13 µg) from each cell line was

methods. lower: ethidium bromide staining was used to visualize
the 28s and 18s rrnas in each sample to ensure equal loading.
(b) western blot analysis of  xxxg350xxx  in cell extracts
of control (wg1892) and d444n fibroblast cell lines. cell extracts
(15 µg of protein) from wg1892 and d444n fibroblast cells were
loaded in each lane, and  xxxg350xxx  was detected with
polyclonal antibodies as described under materials and methods.
to ensure equal loading, the membrane was reprobed with
 xxxg1485xxx  antibody (not shown).

in a fibroblast cell line homozygous for the 1330a f g
 xxxg350xxx  genotype we find that the mutation
is associated with a 4-fold decrease in the steady-state levels
of  xxxg350xxx  although the mrna levels are
unaffected (figure 5). this corresponds very well with the
∼4-fold lower  xxxg350xxx  activity in fibroblast
extracts homozygous for the d444n mutation compared to
the wild-type enzyme in the absence of  xxxd3156xxx  (see figure
2 in ref 17). furthermore, although the d444n mutant is
capable of being activated by  xxxd3156xxx , the response is
elicited at unphysiologically high concentrations of the
effector (figure 4). thus, in an intracellular milieu where
the  xxxd3156xxx  concentration is estimated to be ∼50-80 µm
(22), the d444n would be functionally unresponsive to
 xxxd3156xxx .
the properties of the recombinant enzyme expressed in
e. coli were also characterized in this study. the vmax for
the d444n mutant in the absence of  xxxd3156xxx  is high [237
µmol h-1 (mg of protein)-1 at 37 °c] and more similar to
that of the wild-type enzyme in the presence [295 µmol h-1
(mg of protein)-1] rather than absence [159 µmol h-1 (mg
of protein)-1] of  xxxd3156xxx  (table 1). this is in contrast to an
earlier report in which the activities of the recombinant
d444n mutant and wild-type enzymes were reported to be
comparable in the absence of  xxxd3156xxx  (17). however, these
measurements were made with e. coli cell extracts, and
possible differences in the expression levels of the wild-type
versus mutant proteins were not taken into account.
the observation that a mutation in the c-terminus affects
the affinity of ferrous heme for co in the n-terminus is

a specific activity is represented in units of µmol h-1 (mg of
protein)-1 at 37 °c. the concentration of  xxxd3156xxx  in these assays was
380 µm. b kcat is calculated per mole of active site (63 and 48 kda
molecular masses for the full-length and ∆c413 enzymes, respectively)

the full-length enzyme that exists as higher order aggregates of
tetramers. c these values are taken from ref 7.

interesting and points to interactions between the two ends
of the protein in the three-dimensional structure. this is also
consistent with the observation that the redox sensitivity of
the protein, which is correlated with heme oxidation state
change, is lost upon truncation of the c-terminus (23). the
physiological significance of the high affinity of ferrous
 xxxg350xxx  for co and the consequent inhibition of catalytic activity is presently not known (21, 23).
the d444n mutation alters the affinity of the enzyme for
co, and this may contribute to the phenotype associated with
this mutation.
the role of the c-terminal domain in regulating the activity
of the catalytic core is poorly understood. its deletion
enhances the kcat of the truncated enzyme 2-fold relative to
the  xxxd3156xxx -activated state of the full-length enzyme (table
1), indicating that this domain functions as an intrasteric
repressor (7). furthermore, truncation results in a change in
the oligomerization state from tetrameric to dimeric, revealing a role for the c-terminal domain in organizing the
quaternary structure of the protein. curiously, deletion of
this domain alleviates the catalytic penalties associated with
a number of catalytic core mutations that are pathogenic and
points to the importance of interactions between the two
domains in modulating enzyme activity (13). in the case of
the v168m variant, which is an example of this class of
pathogenic mutants (13), deletion of the c-terminal regulatory domain increased the plp saturation from 15% to 100%
(14). this results in the truncated enzyme carrying the
v168m mutation becoming catalytically indistinguishable
from the truncated enzyme with the wild-type sequence (13,
14).
in yeast  xxxg350xxx , truncation of the cterminal domain similarly elicits a 2-fold increase in the vmax
of the enzyme and a change in the oligomerization state from
octameric to dimeric (24). however, the c-terminal domains
of the yeast and human enzymes, unlike the catalytic cores,
are not highly conserved at a primary sequence level, and
the yeast enzyme is not responsive to  xxxd3156xxx  (24, 25). our
observation that the d444n mutant behaves like the adometactivated state of the wild-type enzyme (and does not change
its oligomeric state) suggests that the mutation shifts the
conformational equilibrium of the enzyme from a “basal”
to an “activated” state (scheme 1). addition of high
concentrations of  xxxd3156xxx  elicits a superactivated state that
is similar to that of the truncated enzyme. in the model
presented in scheme 1, we present the possibility that an
endogenous small molecule effector and/or one or more

a h, a, and x denote heme,  xxxd3156xxx , and an unknown effector,
respectively. the number associated with each enzyme form represents
its kcat value calculated per mole of active site.

proteins, “x”, could shift the conformational equilibrium of
the wild-type enzyme to the superactivated state which is
mimicked by the d444n mutant at very high  xxxd3156xxx 
concentrations. this model is consistent with the observation
of three kinetically distinguishable states of cystathionine
beta-synthase (table 1), wild-type enzyme in the absence of
 xxxd3156xxx  (basal state), wild-type enzyme in the presence of
 xxxd3156xxx  (activated state), and wild-type enzyme missing the
c-terminus (superactivated state). our observation that the
d444n mutation at supraphysiological concentrations of
 xxxd3156xxx  mimics the superactivated state raises the possibility
that the full-length enzyme is also capable of accessing this
conformation.
in summary, characterization of the biochemical penalties
associated with the d444n missense mutation, first described
in a dutch homocystinuric patient, provides interesting
insights into the properties of the native enzyme. the
mutation mimics an activated conformation that is elicited
in the wild-type enzyme by the v-type allosteric effector,
 xxxd3156xxx . although the enzyme can be further activated in
vitro at very high concentrations of  xxxd3156xxx , the d444n
mutant would be functionally unresponsive in an intracellular
milieu. the high activity associated with the d444n mutant
is countered by a diminished steady-state level of the mutant
protein and accounts for the 4-fold lower cystathionine
beta-synthase activity reported in cultured fibroblast cell
extracts. the  xxxg350xxx  activity measured in
the patient nevertheless falls within the range measured in
heterozygotes rather than in homozygotes, which is in
contrast to the high homocysteine levels measured in this
patient (17). these findings point to the important role of
the c-terminal domain, either independently or via interactions with one or more proteins, in regulating the intracellular
activity of  xxxg350xxx .
acknowledgment
the authors acknowledge dr. jianmin wu for making the
d444n mutant of  xxxg350xxx  used in these

 xxxg350xxx  activation domain mutant
studies, sebastian oltean for help with the northern and
western blots, and dr. shinichi taoka for determining the
molecular mass of the protein.
