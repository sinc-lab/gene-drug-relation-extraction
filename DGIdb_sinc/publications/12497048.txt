the use, tolerability and ef®cacy of the non-steroidal anti-androgen  xxxd2725xxx 
(anandron1) in daily clinical practice was investigated in this 5-y project. in total
725 patients were recruited from 27 dutch centres. the investigated population
was very heterogeneous and different therapeutic options were reported. we may
conclude that in general good results have been obtained, especially in ®rst line
combination therapy combined with luteinising hormone releasing hormone
( xxxg930xxx ) agonists. patients with a good performance status at inclusion seem to
bene®t more from  xxxd2725xxx  combination therapy. prostate cancer and prostatic

introduction
prostate cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed
tumours in elderly men.1 in spite of improved methods of
screening an important number of patients are still diagnosed in an advanced cancer stage, frequently associated
with boney or soft tissue metastases. suppression of
androgens has been the mainstay in the treatment of
metastatic prostate cancer for nearly 60 y.2 suppression
of androgens has been achieved by surgical castration
(orchiectomy), estrogens, and more recently by chemical
castration by the administration of luteinising hormone
releasing hormone ( xxxg930xxx ) agonists.3
androgens of adrenal origin, may play a signi®cant
role in disease progression. in 1945 huggins and scott
had already reported a secondary response to surgical
adrenalectomy in patients who had relapsed following
orchidectomy.4
the effects of androgens of adrenal origin can be
suppressed by using anti-androgens. this is the concept
of maximal androgen blockade (mab). anti-androgens
can also be used to suppress the clinical consequences of

¯are-up; the initial rise in androgen levels caused by
chemical castration.
since 1990 the anti-androgen  xxxd2725xxx  (anandron1)
has been registered and marketed in the netherlands for
advanced prostate cancer patients.  xxxd2725xxx  is a nonsteroidal anti-androgen that binds speci®cally to the
 xxxg183xxx  and is available in 50 and 150 mg
tablets for once daily oral administration.5 initially
 xxxd2725xxx  was registered for the prevention of ¯are-up
in the ®rst month after the start of an  xxxg930xxx -agonist
treatment, from 1996 it has been used for long-term use in
combination with surgical or chemical castration.
drug development does not stop with registration. it is
the responsibility of practising clinicians and drug companies (the pharmaceutical industry) to continue to monitor the bene®ts and problems associated with the use of
the drug once it is prescribed outside the strict criteria of
clinical trials. in 1991, the dutch health council introduced post marketing surveillance (pms) to the monitoring of all therapeutic effects, bene®cial or otherwise,
resulting from commercial use of a drug.6 pms is part
of the drug development assessment upon which rational,
effective and safe prescribing should be based. the major
criteria for a well-performed pms include a non-interventional design to prevent selection bias, use of a representative patient population and a relatively high number of
patients.7 ± 9
this project was initiated in 1991 in the netherlands,
just after dutch approval of  xxxd2725xxx  and was set up

post marketing surveillance of  xxxd2725xxx 
emc schasfoort et al

according to international guidelines for pms. the goals
of this project were to assess the use of  xxxd2725xxx  and to
collect more safety and ef®cacy data from daily clinical
practice of dutch urologists.

methods
patients
in total 27 centers have participated in this project.
prostate cancer patients who had been prescribed  xxxd2725xxx  by their urologist were included. upon receiving
detailed information from the physician, patients were
asked to give oral consent to store their data anonymously in a database, con®dentiality was strictly maintained throughout the project.
according to the company's core labelling, treatment
with  xxxd2725xxx  should start with an initial treatment of
300 mg/day for 4 weeks, followed by a maintenance
treatment of 150 mg/day from the 5th week onwards.
the observation period of the project was from the start
of  xxxd2725xxx  treatment until discontinuation of  xxxd2725xxx 
or until the cut-off date as decided by the sponsor. visits of
patients to the urologist took place according to the routine
daily practice. the design and the performance of the
project did not interfere with that routine practice. only
the urologist, who was treating the patient, could decide
what the most appropriate investigations for his patient and
treatment at any given time was.

data handling and statistical procedures
all available data had to be compiled via patient report
forms. per patient visit a booklet had to be ®lled in
including the data summarised in table 1. at the sponsor
the completed forms were checked for inconsistencies.
in case of any queries the investigator was asked for
clari®cation by mail or via a personal visit.
all data received by the sponsor have been included in
the evaluation.

for data handling and analysis purposes so-called
reference dates were used instead of visit numbers, ie
for all observations the time was expressed as the number
of months after the start of treatment.
the statistical analysis was descriptive. the median
survival times and progression-free intervals were
computed according to kaplan ± meier's method. the
progression free interval curves for the different strata
were compared according to the gehan ± wilcoxon rank
statistics.
in addition an explorative analysis was performed on
the progression free interval data. the cox proportionalhazards regression model was used to ®nd with a backward regression procedure the most signi®cant prognostic factors. variables were progressively eliminated on the
basis of the maximum partial-likelihood estimate (mle)
statistics, keeping those variables in the model whose
mle statistics satis®ed the criterion of a two-sided pvalue less than 0.05.
plots of the score ð and schoenfeld residuals were used
to assess the proportional hazard model assumptions.

results
patient recruitment
recruitment of patients started in autumn 1991. however,
some investigators ®lled in patient record forms retrospectively, the ®rst patient was included in july 1990. the
last patient entered the project in april 1996.
the cut-off date of the project was november 1996. the
last visit registered was march 1997.
included in this ®nal analysis were all those patients
with an initial visit case report form ®lled in. this yields a
total of 725 evaluable patients, recruited from 27 different
centers.

demographic characteristics
the mean age of the patients was 74 y, ranging from 40 to
95 y. almost all patients were caucasian (99%).
one hundred and one (101  14%) patients had received
`hoped for' curative treatment, in most cases external beam
radiotherapy. one third of the patients (n  234) had previously received hormonal therapy. one hundred ®fty-one
had undergone orchiectomy, 67 patients had been treated
with  xxxg930xxx -agonists and 76 patients had already received
other anti-androgens before inclusion.
most of the patients were in good (63%) or average
(31%) general condition. for 75% of the patients no
metastatic related pain was reported. severe metastatic
pain was reported by only 4% of the patients. three
hundred and eighty-nine patients complained of mild to
severe urinary obstructive symptoms.
almost half of the patients (49%) had an eastern
cooperative oncology group (ecog) performance
status equal to 0 at the start of  xxxd2725xxx  treatment.
a performance status of 1 (restricted in physically
strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out
light work) was recorded in 31% of the cases. in only 7%
of the patients was a performance status of 3 ± 4 reported
at the time of inclusion in the project.

the majority (64%) of the patients had a t3 or t4
tumour at baseline, 18% of the patients had a t2 tumour.
half of the patients (50%) had boney metastases and
20% had soft tissue metastases at the start of  xxxd2725xxx 
treatment.

concomitant illnesses and medication
almost 60% of the patients (n  427) reported one or more
concomitant relevant diseases other than prostate cancer,
the majority of which (n  279) were of cardiovascular
origin.

dosage and duration of treatment
most patients received as a ®rst prescription a daily dose
of 150 mg  xxxd2725xxx  (58%), 39% patients received a daily
dose of 300 mg. at the second visit a daily dose of 150 mg
was prescribed for most patients and only for six patients
a daily dose of 300 mg was prescribed. for almost a
quarter of the patients no dosage prescription was
recorded at the second visit.
the observation period of the patients varied from less
than 2 weeks (41 patients) up to 63 months (1 patient).
the median number of follow-up visits per patient was
three, with a range of 1 ± 20 visits. the mean time between
the ®rst and second visit was 126 days. this is a rough
estimation, because not all investigators ®lled in a report
form at each visit.

patient populations ð  xxxd2725xxx  subgroups
the use of  xxxd2725xxx  could be subdivided into six
subgroups: (1)  xxxd2725xxx  long-term combined with a
 xxxg930xxx -agonist (290 patients); (2) combined with orchiectomy (109 patients); (3) as prevention of ¯are-up during
the ®rst weeks of administration of an  xxxg930xxx -agonist (33
patients); (4) in monotherapy (80 patients); (5) after progression after an  xxxg930xxx -agonist (26 patients); (6) after
progression at least 3 months after orchiectomy (83
patients). one hundred and four patients did not fall in
any of these categories (eg patients who received  xxxd2725xxx  as neo-adjuvant therapy).

compliance
compliance was measured by asking the question at
follow-up visits: `has the patient taken  xxxd2725xxx  regularly?' in almost all cases (95%) this question was
answered with `yes' in the record forms.
in this project, 516 patients discontinued treatment.
progression (n  202) and adverse events (n  132) were
the most frequently reported reasons for discontinuation.
sixty-nine patients died and for 42 patients the treatment
course was stopped after its use to prevent ¯are-up with
 xxxg930xxx  monotherapy. the majority of patients in this
group used  xxxd2725xxx  for 4 weeks only.

ef®cacy
all patients (n  725) with at least one case record form
completed were included in this ®nal analysis. for 30
prostate cancer and prostatic diseases

patients (4%) only one visit was registered as they were
lost to follow-up. this means that the results do not add
up to a total of 100%.
complete regression was seen in 41% of the patients
during treatment, partial regression was seen in 33% of
the patients.
the best response to treatment for speci®c treatment
groups was evaluated as well. complete or partial subjective regression was reported for 86% of the patients
starting  xxxd2725xxx  in combination with an  xxxg930xxx -agonist. of the 109 patients receiving  xxxd2725xxx  in combination with orchiectomy 76% reported regression. sixty-six
percent of patients receiving  xxxd2725xxx  in monotherapy
(n  80) reported regression at any time in the project.
patients already in progression, using  xxxd2725xxx  after
orchiectomy or after treatment with an  xxxg930xxx -agonist
reported less frequent `regression' (60%) than patients
using  xxxd2725xxx  in combination with orchiectomy or
an  xxxg930xxx -agonist.
the subjective response per treatment group has been
evaluated. it appeared that the group of patients receiving
 xxxd2725xxx  in combination with an  xxxg930xxx -agonist
showed the best subjective response of all groups. at
month 6, 86% of these patients (n  293) reported subjective regression, at month 18 (n  142) 84% were still in
subjective remission.
for the 519 patients with performance status data after
at least 6 months of treatment this status was compared
with the baseline performance status. the performance
status remained the same for 49% of the patients, in 12%
of the cases there had been deterioration and in 40% there
was an improvement in performance status after at least 6
months of treatment.
the prostate speci®c antigen (psa) value is considered
to be a biochemical marker for the status of prostate
cancer. psa-values at baseline and changes during treatment were evaluated: overall, 548 patients (76%) had a
better nadir-psa value during treatment than their baseline measurement, 104 (14%) patients did not achieve a
lower psa-value during treatment than measured at
baseline, for 73 (10%) no psa-data at baseline or followup were available.
for the group receiving  xxxd2725xxx  in combination
with orchiectomy or an  xxxg930xxx -agonist, respectively 84%
and 79% had a psa nadir lower than 4 ng/ml. from the
patients who received  xxxd2725xxx  after progression after
orchiectomy only 38% of the patients had after 6 months
of treatment a nadir-psa value lower than 4 ng/ml.
the spearman rank-correlation coef®cient between the
nadir-psa value during treatment and the best subjective
response equals 0.6597, (n  481).
the spearman rank-correlation coef®cient between the
relative change in psa-value during treatment
(nadir_psa-baseline_psa)/baseline_psa) equals 0.6195
(n  431).
from the 725 patients, 276 patients had shown progression or died of their disease. the other 449 patients
were regarded as censored.
the median progression free survival time was 14
months with a 95% con®dence interval of [12 ± 15]
months. a sub-analysis of the patient groups receiving
 xxxd2725xxx  in combination with an  xxxg930xxx -agonist or in
combination with orchiectomy showed a median progression free interval of 17 months in both groups. in the

post marketing surveillance of  xxxd2725xxx 
emc schasfoort et al

group of patients with a good performance status combining  xxxd2725xxx  with an  xxxg930xxx -agonist, the median
time to progression was 19 months; patients with a bad
performance (2 ± 4) had a median time to progression of
13 months.
the progression free interval curves were calculated for
patients with different baseline performance status. the
p-value of the gehan ± wilcoxon test was 0.0025 indicating a signi®cant difference in time to progression whatever the treatment group was.
to ®nd possible prognostic factors in the cox proportional hazards regression method the data collected at
baseline and described in literature were used. to avoid a
large reduction of the data set in the ®nal backward cox
regression procedure because of different amounts of
missing values for the different prognostic factors, a
uni-variate regression analysis was initially performed
for possible prognostic factors. in the backward regression modelling the signi®cant uni-variate prognostic factors were included in the initial model: treatment group,
performance status, presence of boney metastases, psa,
alkaline phosphatase (alk.p.) and haemoglobin.
in the ®nal model the prognostic factors psa group,
alk.p. group and haemoglobin concentration at baseline
appeared to be signi®cant in predicting the progression
free interval.

ment and 32% were reported as severe. particularly eye
disorders and gynaecomastia were reported as highly
probably related to  xxxd2725xxx , these symptoms were
registered as severe in, respectively 4% and 15% of
these adverse event symptoms. liver function disturbance was reported in 12 patients, dyspnea was reported
in 11 patients.
one hundred and thirty-two patients (132  18% of all
patients) discontinued treatment because of adverse
events.
a list of the 10 most frequently reported adverse events
is given in table 2. adverse events were also reported per
treatment group. in the monotherapy group fewer
adverse events were reported, 25% of the monotherapy
patients, compared to 44% in total group.
in total, 100 serious adverse events, de®ned as life
threatening were reported. from these events, three
cases: dizziness, interstitial pneumonitis and liver
injury/hepatocellular jaundice had been assessed as possibly related to  xxxd2725xxx  by both the investigator and
the sponsor. in addition three events: one abdominal pain,
one abnormal liver function, one pulmonary embolism
(resulting in death) had been assessed as possibly related
to  xxxd2725xxx  therapy by the urologist, but not by the
sponsor.
in total, 69 patients died during the project. for one
patient, who died because of multiple lung emboli, the
investigator reported a possible relation with  xxxd2725xxx .

safety
in total, 341 out of 725 patients (44%) reported adverse
events. the most frequently reported adverse events were
in the digestive system category (nausea and vomiting for
83 patients (11%)) followed by the nervous system (especially hot ¯ushes 74 patients (10%)) and eye disorders
(total of light/dark adaptation and visual disturbances;
57 patients (8%)).
in total, 471 adverse events were reported of which 164
(35%) were highly probably related to  xxxd2725xxx  treat-

project were met, such as a non interventional design to
prevent selection bias and a relatively high number of
patients.7,8
as might be expected, a non-interventional design
results in an enormous variation in the timing of control
visits and the number of data collected. this can be seen
in the range of time between visit 1 and 2 and the number
of visits per patient. for this reason the ef®cacy results of
this pms project have to be interpreted with care.
at the start of this project in 1991,  xxxd2725xxx  was
only registered in the netherlands for the prevention of
¯are in prostate cancer patients during the ®rst month
of  xxxg930xxx -agonist treatment. apparently most of the
urologists did not prescribe  xxxd2725xxx  according to the
registered indication, but prescribed  xxxd2725xxx  as a
`long-term' combination therapy supported by publications
showing ef®cacy of maximal androgen blockade.10 ± 13
since 1996  xxxd2725xxx  was registered as maintenance
therapy together with castration.
the majority of the patients included in the project
were at a relatively good clinical status. the general
condition was assessed as good in 63% of the patients,
no metastatic pain was recorded in 75% of the patients,
and a performance status of 0 or 1 was recorded in 81% of
the patients. however, almost one third of the patients
had already received palliative treatment, including other
anti-androgens (10%) before enrolment in this project.
most probably this has in¯uenced the results obtained
in this project.
an important issue in prostate cancer is the monitoring
of the response to therapy. here psa appears to be the
most useful marker. in addition, the decrease of serum
psa after hormonal treatment appears to be an important
prognostic factor.14 the spearman rank-correlation coef®cient between the nadir-psa value during treatment and
the best subjective response con®rmed the anticipated
relationship (0.66 for n  481).
for the group receiving  xxxd2725xxx  in combination
with orchiectomy or an  xxxg930xxx -agonist, respectively 84%
and 79% had a psa nadir lower than 4 ng/ml. these
results are comparable with the results reported in the
literature that after the start about 75 ± 80% of the patients
reach a psa nadir below 4 ng/ml after 3 or 6 months.13,15
in the literature only a small amount of data are
available on the use of  xxxd2725xxx  as monotherapy.17
in this project 80 patients (11%) received  xxxd2725xxx 
monotherapy as indicated by the urologist. we have to
be very careful interpreting these data, but the results
obtained seem to be worthwhile. although patients on
 xxxd2725xxx  monotherapy did not respond as well as those
on maximal androgen blockade, still 62% of the patients
reported partial or complete subjective remission at any
time after inclusion. less adverse events occurred in the
monotherapy group.
it is clear in the group of patients already in progression, who received  xxxd2725xxx  as second-line after orchiectomy or after treatment with an  xxxg930xxx -agonist, were
more often progressive than patients using  xxxd2725xxx  as
monotherapy or in combination with orchiectomy or
 xxxg930xxx -agonist. the time to progression also differed
signi®cantly between the therapy groups (p-value of the
gehan ± wilcoxon test equals 0.0001). for the patients
using  xxxd2725xxx  in combination with orchiectomy or
 xxxg930xxx -agonist the median time to progression is calcu-

prostate cancer and prostatic diseases

lated separately for patients with a baseline performance
status of 0 or 1, and patients with a baseline performance
status of 2, 3 or 4. for patients using  xxxd2725xxx  in
combination with an  xxxg930xxx -agonist, a very clear difference could be shown between patients with a good (0 ± 1)
and bad (2 ± 4) performance status. the median time to
progression was respectively 19 months and 13 months
and these data are comparable with data from the literature. for men with newly diagnosed metastatic disease,
the median time to progression is 12 ± 18 months.18 again,
we have to take into account that we are looking at a very
heterogeneous patient population. patients who did not
report progression were censored and more patients
were lost to follow-up compared to phase ii/iii
trials with stringent inclusion criteria and more intensive
monitoring.
in the ®nal model of the explorative analysis, the
prognostic factors: treatment group, psa, alkaline phosphatase and haemoglobin concentration were signi®cant
in predicting progression free interval. these factors have
also been described in the literature.16 although good
results were obtained in patients with a good performance status treated by maximal androgen blockade,
performance status could not be shown as one of the
prognostic factors in this model.
the frequency of adverse events (related and nonrelated to  xxxd2725xxx ) were similar or less than in other
studies investigating anti-androgens.11 the most frequently reported adverse events were nausea and vomiting in 83 patients (11%) followed by hot ¯ushes in 74
patients (10%) and eye disorders (total of light/dark
adaptation and visual disturbances; 57 patients (8%)).
liver function disturbances and respiratory complaints
have been reported as well but less than in other clinical
studies. although this is a positive result, we have to take
into account that the data were only monitored `in-house'
at the sponsor, no source data veri®cation was done, so
this may have in¯uenced the results.
in summary we can say that pms in prostate cancer
patients is feasible. although results have to be interpreted with care, interesting data can be collected. by
more intensive monitoring and source data veri®cation,
the quality of the data could be improved.
good results have been obtained for the use of  xxxd2725xxx  in ®rst line combination therapy. patients with a
good performance status at inclusion seem to bene®t
more from  xxxd2725xxx  combination therapy; their time
to progression was delayed. toxicity appeared to be
comparable with or less than that already known from
other studies.
the results from patients receiving anti-androgen
monotherapy look promising but need to be further
investigated, in prospective randomised trials.
