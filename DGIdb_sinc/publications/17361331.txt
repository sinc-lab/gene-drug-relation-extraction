abstract medulloblastoma (mb) is the most common
malignant neuroepithelial tumor of childhood. the dna
 xxxg2312xxx  ( xxxg2312xxx ) inhibitor etoposide has been
widely used for the treatment of mbs; however, it remains
unknown whether mb cells are more sensitive to etoposide
than other malignant neuroepithelial tumor cells. in this
study, we tested the chemosensitivities of malignant neuroepithelial tumors (26 glioblastomas, 9 anaplastic astrocytomas, and 5 mbs) to etoposide and vincristine using the
succinate dehydrogenase inhibition test and found that mb
cells are more sensitive to etoposide and more resistant to
vincristine than other tumor cells. we performed quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction to
evaluate the expression of genes related to etoposide sensitivity, and found co-overexpression of dna  xxxg2312xxx  ( xxxg2312xxx ) a and b mrna in mbs. in addition, the
levels of topo iia and b mrna in these tumors correlated
with etoposide sensitivity. immunohistochemical studies

the percentages of topo iia immunopositive cells (topo

the topo iia nor the mib-1 labeling index correlated with
the levels of topo iia mrna or etoposide sensitivity.
based on these observations, topo iia and b mrna
expression, but not the topo iia labeling index, might be a
useful marker for sensitivity to etoposide in human
malignant neuroepithelial tumors.

introduction
medulloblastoma (mb) is the most common malignant
brain tumor of childhood. it is a highly malignant tumor
that corresponds histologically to who grade iv [1];
however, treatment outcomes have greatly improved over
the last few decades. recently, the overall survival of patients with mb has approached 70–80% [2]. in contrast, the
prognosis of patients with glioblastoma (gbm), the most
malignant type of glioma, corresponding to who grade
iv, is dismal. despite advances in surgery, radiotherapy,
and chemotherapy, the median survival time of patients
with gbm is only 1 year [3, 4]. although surgical resection
is an important component of therapeutic success, progress
in the treatment of mb appears to be associated with its
sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
over the last few decades, various chemotherapeutic
agents have been used to treat mb [2]. among them, etoposide, a semisynthetic glucoside derivative of  xxxd2980xxx ,
has been widely used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents; for example, cisplatin/carboplatin,

123

120

cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and etoposide [2, 5, 6]; carboplatin and etoposide [7–9];  xxxd444xxx / xxxd3358xxx  and etoposide
[10]; and  xxxd2327xxx , cisplatin, and etoposide [11]. etoposide appears to be effective for the clinical treatment of mbs;
however, it has not been shown whether mb cells are more
sensitive to etoposide than other malignant neuroepithelial
tumor cells such as gbm and anaplastic astrocytoma (aa).
inhibition of dna  xxxg2312xxx  ( xxxg2312xxx ) is known
to be a major mechanism of the action of etoposide [12].
 xxxg2312xxx  is an enzyme that controls dna topology by
cleaving and rejoining dna strands. etoposide stabilizes
the dna– xxxg2312xxx  cleavage complex and leads to inhibition
of dna replication, which results in cell death. there are
two isoforms of  xxxg2312xxx , a and b, which are highly similar
but genetically distinct, and display different expression
patterns. topo iia is expressed in proliferating cells in late
s phase, with a peak in the g2 to m phases, but is not
expressed in g0, which represents resting and nonproliferating cells [13]. in comparison, topo iib is continuously
expressed once cells enter the cell cycle, and is still present
in the g0 phase. etoposide is more active in tumor cells
expressing higher levels of  xxxg2312xxx  [12, 14–17], and
overexpression of multidrug resistance 1 (mdr-1)/p-glycoprotein [18] or multidrug resistance-associated proteins
(mrp)-1 [19] and 2 [20] has been shown to be associated
with cellular resistance to this agent.
over the last 3 years, we have evaluated the sensitivities of malignant neuroepithelial tumor cells obtained by surgical resection to various chemotherapeutic
agents, including etoposide and vincristine, using the
succinate dehydrogenase inhibition (sdi) test. we found
that mb cells are more sensitive to etoposide than other
tumor cells. in this study, we examined the expression
of genes related to etoposide sensitivity in these tumors,
and found that the expression levels of topo iia and b
mrna in mbs are significantly higher than those in
other malignant neuroepithelial tumors. furthermore, the
expression levels of topo iia and b mrna in these
tumors correlated with sensitivity to etoposide. we
discuss the possible relevance of the enhanced expression of  xxxg2312xxx  genes in mbs to their sensitivity to
etoposide.

materials and methods
tumor samples
this study was approved by the local ethical review board
of kyushu university hospital. all patients with malignant
neuroepithelial tumors were treated at kyushu university
hospital and its affiliated hospitals between 2002 and 2005.
tumor specimens were obtained by surgical resection in all

123

j neurooncol (2007) 84:119–129

cases. the samples included 26 gbms (three pediatric
gbms), 9 aas, and 5 mbs. tumor samples were routinely
fixed in formalin before being processed to paraffin sections, or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after
resection and stored at –80 c until use. paraffin-embedded
tumor samples were sectioned at 6 lm, and subjected to
hematoxylin and eosin staining and appropriate immunostaining for diagnosis. histological diagnosis was made by
two neuropathologists (s.o.s. and t.i.) according to the
latest who classification of brain tumors [1].
immunohistochemistry
immunohistochemistry was performed on 6-lm paraffinembedded sections. the sections were deparaffinized in
xylene, rehydrated in graded ethanol, and incubated with
0.3%  xxxd2298xxx  in absolute methanol to inhibit
endogenous peroxidase activity. after being rinsed in tap
water, the sections were completely immersed in 10 mm
citrate buffer (ph 6.0) and autoclaved at 121 c for 5 min
to retrieve antigenicity. after being rinsed in phosphatebuffered saline (pbs) containing 0.3% triton x-100 (pbst), then in pbs, the sections were incubated at 4 c
overnight with monoclonal anti-human mib-i antibody
(dako, denmark) or monoclonal anti-human topoisomerase iia antibody (dako) at a 1:100 dilution in pbs-t
containing 5% nonfat skim milk. the sections were then
sequentially incubated with biotinylated antimouse igg
antibody (amersham, uk) at a 1:200 dilution in pbs-t
and peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin–biotin complex
(amersham, uk) at a 1:100 dilution in pbs-t for 1 h at
room temperature. the reaction product was developed by
immersing the slides in 50 mm tris–hcl buffer containing
0.05% 3,3¢-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and
0.0015%  xxxd2298xxx . the color reaction was
stopped by rinsing the slides in tap water, and then the
slides were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin. the
sections were extensively rinsed in tap water, dehydrated,
and mounted. preimmune serum or blocking peptide for
antibody absorption was used for controls, which gave no
staining signal or only minimal background staining.
for immunofluorescence double-staining, we produced
rabbit polyclonal ki-67 antiserum  xxxg1768xxx , which was raised
against an octavalent peptide-antigen matrix of the central
part of human ki-67 (qaledlagfkelfqt, the socalled ki-67 motif in exon 13). the specificity of  xxxg1768xxx  was
tested by immunofluorescence double-staining of malignant brain tumors with the monoclonal anti-ki-67 antibody
mib-1 (dako) (data not shown). the deparaffinized
sections were incubated at 4 c overnight with monoclonal
antihuman topoisomerase iia antibody (dako) at a 1:50
dilution and polyclonal ki-67 antiserum ( xxxg1768xxx ) at a
1:3,000 dilution in 50 mm tris–hcl buffer containing

j neurooncol (2007) 84:119–129

0.3% triton x-100 (tbt) and 5% normal goat serum. the
sections were incubated with texas red-conjugated secondary antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated
secondary antibody (amersham biosciences, uk) in tbt
for 1 h at room temperature, and then counterstained with
4¢,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (molecular probes, eugene,
or).
topo iia labeling index (li) and mib-1 li
the immunopositivity of topo iia (topo iiali) and mib-1
(mib-1 li) was expressed as the percentage of cells in the
specimen that were immunopositive, excluding vascular
components and hematogenous cells. more than 1,000 cells
were counted at high power in several fields with the
largest numbers of immunopositive cells. all positively
stained nuclei and cytoplasm were scored as positive
regardless of the staining intensity. the lis were evaluated
with the assistance of an image analysis computer program,
gunma li ver. 017 (http://omt.med.gunma-u.ac.jp/~tgaku/
gunmali/jmain.htm).
sdi test
the sdi test was performed by the methods described
previously [21, 22]. in brief, tumor tissues were cut up with
scissors, and the resulting fragments were put into sterile
flasks containing sufficient amounts of minimal essential
medium (mem). the cells were passed through a nylon
mesh and washed twice with mem. aliquots (100 ll) of
this single-cell suspension were dispensed into 96-well
microtiter plates and incubated at 37 c in a humidified 5%
co2 atmosphere for 3 days in the presence of antitumor
drugs, including etoposide and vincristine. each antitumor
drug was tested  xxxd1891xxx  times the peak plasma concentration.
the colorimetric reaction was initiated by adding 3-(4,5dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl[2h]-tetrazolium bromide (mtt) at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml and 0.1 m
sodium succinate. the formazan formed from mtt was
extracted with  xxxd1896xxx , and the absorbance of
formazan was measured at 540 nm using a spectrophotometer (labsystems multiskan jx; thermo bioanalysis
company, finland). the chemosensitivity to certain drugs
was expressed as the percentage of succinate dehydrogenase (sd) activity in the drug-treated cells compared with
that in control cells (drug-untreated tumor cells from the
same patient). thus, the lower the percentage of sd activity
in the drug-treated cells, the higher the chemosensitivity.
for phenotypic characterization, some primary culture
cells underwent immunocytochemical studies using glial
fibrillary acidic protein (gfap) antibody and  xxxg2236xxx  antibody. these cells (1 · 106 cells) were centri-

121

fuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min and fixed 3.7% formalin with
0.1% triton-x for 10 min at room temperature. after being
rinsed in pbs, the cells were sequentially incubated at 4 c
overnight with polyclonal anti-gfap antibody (dako) at
1:200 dilution in pbs and with monoclonal anti- xxxg2236xxx  antibody (sy38, dako) at 1:200 dilution in pbs.
the cells were then sequentially incubated with texas redconjugated secondary antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (amersham) in pbs
for 1 h at room temperature.
real-time polymerase chain reaction
total rna was extracted from frozen tumor specimens
using the total rnaeasy isolation kit (qiagen, germany)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the template
cdnas for real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr)
were synthesized from 1 lg of total rna using the revertra ace kit (toyobo, japan) with oligo (dt)20 primer
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. topo i
(hs00243257_m1), topo iia (hs00172214_m1) and b
hs00172259_m1), mdr-1 (hs00184491_m1), and  xxxg399xxx 
(hs00219905_m1) and 2 (hs00166123_m1) mrna
expressions were measured using the 7500 real time pcr
system (applied biosystems, ca) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. all reporter dyes were fluorochrome
[6-carboxyfluorescein (6-fam)], and no quencher dyes
were used. all analyses were performed in triplicate, and
means were used for statistical calculations. the relative
quantification scores (rqs) of the samples were compared.
the endogenous control was b-actin, and normal brain
samples from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy were
used for calibration. rq is the delta delta threshold cycle
(ct) compared with the calibration and endogenous control.
statistical analysis
the data were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance
(anova) with multiple comparisons using the bonferroni
method, pearson correlation analysis for normally distributed data, and spearman rank correlation analysis for data
that were not normally distributed. a p value of less than 0.05
(two-sided) was considered to be statistically significant.

chemosensitivity of malignant neuroepithelial tumor
cells to etoposide and vincristine
we examined 40 malignant neuroepithelial tumor samples
for sensitivity to various chemotherapeutic agents, including etoposide and vincristine, using sdi tests. the samples

123

included 26 gbms, 9 aas, and 5 mbs (table 1). we
confirmed the phenotypes of our primary culture cells by
immunocytochemical analysis. the gbm cells were positive for gfap and negative for  xxxg2236xxx . in contrast,
mb cells were positive for  xxxg2236xxx  and negative for
gfap. we first analyzed the sensitivity to each drug based
on histological diagnosis, and found that mb cells were
more sensitive to etoposide than other malignant tumors
(fig. 1a). the mean percentages of sd activity in etoposide-treated cells in gbms, aas, and mbs were
81.4 ± 11.9, 72.2 ± 18.1, and 57.1 ± 6.3, respectively. in
contrast, mb cells were more resistant to vincristine than
other tumor cells. the mean percentages of sd activity in
vincristine-treated cells in gbms, aas, and mbs were
66.5 ± 14.3, 71.2 ± 12.2, and 94.6 ± 0.9, respectively
(fig. 1b). because the mean age of the patients with mb
(7.0 years) was significantly less than the age of patients
with other tumor types, we also analyzed the drug sensitivities of gbms from pediatric patients (mean age 10.7
years). the mean percentages of sd activity in etoposideand vincristine-treated pediatric gbm cells were
89.0 ± 7.0 and 64.0 ± 14.1, respectively. there was no
significant difference between sd activities in pediatric
gbms and those in adult gbms.
overexpression of topo iia and b mrna in mb
to investigate the expression of genes related to etoposide
sensitivity, total rna was extracted from malignant neu-

roepithelial tumor samples and subjected to real-time pcr.
we observed a significant increase in the mrna levels of
topo iia in mbs compared with the other malignant tumors (fig. 2a). the mean log2 rqs of topo iia mrna in
gbms, aas, and mbs were 6.19 ± 0.58, 4.21 ± 0.96, and
9.32 ± 0.29, respectively. expression of topo iib mrna
in mbs was also significantly higher than in the other
malignant tumors, though it was lower than in topo iia. in
addition, the levels of topo iib mrna were significantly
correlated with those of topo iia (fig. 2b). expression of
topo i mrna in mbs was higher than in aas and gbms;
however, there was no significant difference between mbs
and gbms. expression of  xxxg399xxx  and mrp-2 mrna in
mbs was also higher than in aas and gbms; however, the
difference was not significant (fig. 2a). there were no
significant differences in the expression of mdr-1 mrna
between the tumor types (fig. 2a).

correlation between topo iia expression and etoposide
sensitivity
we analyzed the correlation between the sensitivity to each
drug and the level of each mrna. we found that the levels
of topo iia and b mrna were significantly correlated with
etoposide sensitivity in these tumor cells; higher expression
of topo iia and b mrna resulted in increasing sensitivity
(fig. 3a and b). the correlation coefficient for the relationship between topo iia and etoposide sensitivity was -

iib and etoposide sensitivity was –0.35 (p < 0.05). in
contrast, the levels of topo iia and b mrna were inversely correlated with vincristine sensitivity (fig. 3c). we
did not find any significant correlation between topo i,
mdr–1, and  xxxg399xxx  and 2 levels and sensitivity to any of
these drugs (table 2).
immunohistochemical analysis of topo iia expression
in malignant neuroepithelial tumor samples
we next examined the expression of topo iia protein by
immunohistochemistry. we also examined the expression
of ki-67 antigen using monoclonal mib-1 antibody, because previous reports had demonstrated that the proliferation indices based on cell staining for mib-1 and topo iia
were highly correlated with one another [13, 23]. despite
the heterogeneous staining, all 40 malignant neuroepithelial tumor samples expressed topo iia protein in the nuclei
of tumor cells (fig. 4). consistent with previous reports,
topo iia li was highly correlated with mib-1 li (fig. 6a).
topo iia li was highest in mbs, intermediate in gbms,
and lowest in aas (table 1). although the expression of
topo iia mrna in pediatric gbms was lower than in
mbs, the mean topo iia li in pediatric gbms was higher

than that in mbs (table 1). using immunofluorescence
double staining, we observed that mib-1-immunopositive
cells simultaneously expressed high levels of topo iia
protein (fig. 5). we then sought to determine whether the
levels of topo iia mrna correlated with topo iia li or
mib-1 li. topo iia li tended to correlate with topo iia
mrna; however, the correlation was not statistically significant (fig. 6b). there was no correlation between topo
iia mrna and mib-1 li (fig. 6c). in addition, we did not
find any significant correlation between etoposide sensitivity and topo iia li (fig. 6d) or mib-1 li.

discussion
etoposide has been shown to be useful for the clinical
treatment of mbs. previous reports have demonstrated the
feasibility of treating recurrent mbs with oral etoposide
alone [24–26], and various chemotherapy regimens currently used for the treatment of mbs contain etoposide [2,
11, 27]. however, it has not been shown whether mb cells
are primarily sensitive to etoposide, relative to other
malignant brain tumors. in this study, we demonstrated for
the first time that mb cells are more sensitive to etoposide

than other malignant neuroepithelial tumor cells, via an
sdi test using surgically obtained samples. our observations support the use of etoposide for the treatment of patients with mbs.
conversely, mb cells were more resistant to vincristine
than other tumor cells in sdi tests. in addition, we observed an inverse correlation between the levels of topo
iia and vincristine sensitivity in malignant neuroepithelial
tumor cells. the reason for this phenomenon is unclear.
vincristine is a microtubule-targeting agent and is often
used in chemotherapy for malignant gliomas. in particular,
combined chemotherapy with  xxxd3016xxx ,  xxxd2502xxx , and
vincristine (termed pcv) is well established for the treatment of anaplastic oligodendroglioma [28]. some chemotherapy regimens for mbs also contain vincristine, but all
are combinations involving other chemotherapeutic agents
[2, 27]. in this study, we tested the sensitivities of tumor
cells to single chemotherapeutic agents, so the effect of
combination chemotherapy was not studied. thus, our
observations do not necessarily contradict the use of vin-

123

cristine in combination chemotherapy for mbs. this is one
of the limitations of this study; further studies are needed to
elucidate the effect of combination chemotherapy on these
tumors.
as a consequence, we gave combined chemotherapy
containing etoposide (the ice combination:  xxxd2327xxx ,
cisplatin, and etoposide) to our patients with mbs. during
this period, we had five patients with mbs in the cerebellar vermis. three of them had disseminated lesions in
the spinal canals. tumors in the cerebellar vermis were
removed by surgery in all cases, and radiation therapy
(30 gy directed to the whole craniospinal axis with or
without local boost), and ice chemotherapy (3–7 courses)
were performed sequentially. disseminated lesions in the
spinal canals in all three patients disappeared following
this combined radio-chemotherapy. two of the patients
with disseminated lesions have not experienced tumor
recurrence (follow-up periods: 13 and 45 months,
respectively); however, one patient later had multiple
recurrent lesions in the brain. this patient had received

these recurrent lesions is unknown. two patients without

cellular sensitivity to etoposide is determined by the
amount or activity of  xxxg2312xxx  and the rate of cellular uptake
or efflux of the drug [12]. a number of studies have found a
correlation between  xxxg2312xxx  levels and a response to antitopo ii drugs in various cancer cell lines [14–17]. consistent with these studies, we observed that expression of
topo iia and b mrna was correlated with etoposide
sensitivity in surgical samples of malignant neuroepithelial
tumors. in contrast, in some glioma cell lines, overexpression of mdr-1/p-glycoprotein [18] or  xxxg399xxx  [19] and
2 [20] has been demonstrated as the mechanism of resistance to etoposide. these cells reduced drug accumulation
by increasing drug efflux. in this study, however, we found
no correlation between mdr-1,  xxxg399xxx , or mrp-2 levels
and sensitivity to etoposide. drug accumulation in the cell
is determined by multiple factors, including mdr-1,  xxxg13xxx   xxxg1448xxx , and mrp-2, and the expression level of any particular
one of these genes may not be indicative of cellular sensitivity to the drug. consequently, mrna levels of topo
iia and b, but not mdr-1,  xxxg399xxx , or mrp-2, appear to be
useful markers for sensitivity to etoposide in malignant
neuroepithelial tumors.

in quantitative rt–pcr analysis, we observed a significant increase in the mrna level of topo iia and b in
mbs compared with other malignant neuroepithelial tumors.  xxxg2312xxx  is an essential cellular enzyme that functions
in the segregation of newly replicated chromosome pairs,
in chromosome condensation, and in altering dna superhelicity. previous reports have shown that immunostaining
for topo iia is a useful alternative to mib-1 as a proliferative index in human gliomas [13, 23]. consistent with
previous reports, we observed a significant correlation between topo iia li and mib-1 li in malignant neuroepithelial tumor samples. furthermore, fluorescence double
staining demonstrated that ki-67 immunopositive cells
simultaneously expressed topo iia protein. these observations support the idea that enhanced expression of topo
iia in mbs may reflect the high proliferative activity of this
type of tumor cell. however, we found that there was a
tendency towards but no significant correlation between
topo iia li and etoposide sensitivity. the reason for this
discrepancy is unclear. in this study, we found that the
mean topo iia li in pediatric gbms was higher than that
in mbs, whereas expression of topo iia mrna and

etoposide sensitivity in pediatric gbms were lower than in
mbs. thus, expression levels of topo iia may be more
important for the action of etoposide than the rates of
proliferating cells in these tumors. another possible
explanation is heterogeneity in the tumor tissue. we
determined the topo iia li by counting cells in the
microscopic fields with the largest numbers of immunopositive cells. however, the distributions of topo iia immunopositive cells were heterogeneous in most of the
tumor sections, and topo iia li depends considerably on
the microscopic fields selected. additionally, it is difficult
to quantify the intensity of topo iia staining in each cell.
we do not have enough frozen tumor tissue at the moment,
but an alternative method, such as western blotting, would
be needed for precise quantification of topo iia protein in
the tumor tissue.
oloumi et al. [29] reported that cellular sensitivity to
etoposide in three-dimensional cultures differs from those in
monolayer cultures. they showed that cells from tumor
spheroids or xenograft tumors are more resistant than the
cells from monolayer cultures to etoposide, although the
amount and catalytic activity of topo iia are identical, and
the cell proliferation rate is the same. they suggested that the
differences in phosphorylation status and the subcellular
distribution of topo iia are associated with the cellular response to etoposide. in this study, we did not examined
cellular sensitivities to etoposide in three-dimensional cultures or the phosphorylation status of topo iia; therefore,
these analyses need to be performed in a future investigation
to further clarify the role of topo iia in mbs.

the most common chromosomal rearrangement, detected in up to 40% of mbs, is isochromosome 17
[i(17q)], involving a breakpoint in chromosomal band 17p
11.2 [1, 30]. its high frequency suggests that i(17q) may
play an important role in the pathogenesis of mb, possibly through the disruption or permanent activation of a
gene at the breakpoint. topo iia is encoded by a gene on
chromosome 17q21-q22, and its expression could be affected by i(17q) [31]. mendrzyk et al. [32] screened 47
mbs for chromosomal imbalances using a cgh array,
and found that 18 (38%) of these tumors carried an
apparent i(17q), defined as concurrent 17p loss and 17q
gain with a breakpoint at or very near the centromere.
 xxxg2312xxx  genes might be overexpressed constitutively
independent of the cell cycle in mbs, and be associated
with tumorigenesis. to evaluate the chromosomal abnormality associated with topo iia overexpression in our
cases, we are now undertaking copy-number analysis
using dna microarrays.
in contrast to mbs, gbms are usually chemoresistant,
and the prognosis of patients with gbm remains dismal.
recently, the feasibility of use of temozolomide, an oral
 xxxd3249xxx , has been demonstrated. however, the
median survival time of patients with gbm treated with
radiotherapy plus temozolomide is still only 14–15 months
[3, 4]. our present observations, taken together with the
correlation between  xxxg2312xxx  mrna level and etoposide
sensitivity in malignant neuroepithelial tumors, support
further investigations into the clinical use of etoposide in
the treatment of  xxxg2312xxx  overexpressing malignant tumors.
