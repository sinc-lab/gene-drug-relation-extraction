abstract
currently, low levels of stable gene transfer into hematopoietic
tissues of large animals and humans continues to limit the
clinical application of gene therapy. one strategy for overcoming this problem is to selectively expand, in vivo, the population
of successfully gene-modified cells. recent work has shown
that nucleoside transport inhibition in combination with antifolates can be used to select in vivo for hematopoietic stem cells
expressing drug-resistant  xxxg631xxx  (dhfr). in
this study we investigated whether  xxxd3442xxx  (tmtx) and the
nucleoside transport inhibitor prodrug nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribose phosphate (nbmpr-p) can be used to select for
tyr22-variant dhfr expressing transgenic hematopoietic cells
in a murine bone marrow transplant model. our results indicate
that 40 mg/kg tmtx and 20 mg/kg nbmpr-p can be used in

gene transfer into hematopoietic tissue has the potential
for treatment of a variety of diseases in humans. for many of
these disorders, stable gene transfer into hematopoietic stem
cells would provide the most benefit to patients. unfortunately, gene transfer into hematopoietic tissues with stably
integrating vectors in large animal models and humans has
been reported to be very inefficient, limiting its potential
application (chu et al., 1998). one possible approach to overcoming this low level of stable gene transfer is to selectively
expand, in vivo, those cells into which gene transfer has been
successfully achieved.
several systems have been described that allow for in vivo
selection of hematopoietic cells in mice. the human multidrug resistance gene (mdr-1) (sorrentino et al., 1992) confers resistance to several chemotherapeutic agents such as
anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, podophyllotoxins, paclitaxel
(taxol), and  xxxd1800xxx . dna alkyltransferase genes conthis work was supported by national institutes of health minority predoctoral fellowship award ca63916 to c.a.w. and research grant ca60803 to

combination to expand transgene-positive progenitor cells 3to 4-fold immediately following drug administration. in addition,
long-term progenitor populations were expanded 2- to 3-fold in
primary recipients, to approximately 5 months following drug
administration. secondary transplants conducted with marrow
from primary recipients 5 months following drug administration
revealed a statistically significant selective expansion of transgene-positive cells in the spleens and peripheral blood of these
animals. no such expansion was observed in groups of mice
treated with tmtx alone or nbmpr-p alone. we conclude that
tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p can be used to selectively expand transgenic tyr22-variant dhfr expressing murine hematopoietic
stem cells in vivo.

fer resistance to 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (davis
et al., 1997). a third system utilizes drug-resistant forms of
the enzyme  xxxg631xxx  (dhfr) in combination
with the antifolates methotrexate (mtx) and  xxxd3442xxx 
(tmtx) (allay et al., 1997, 1998). these studies have provided proof of principle for in vivo selection, and have provided a foundation upon which to explore this strategy.
dhfr catalyzes the reduction of folate and dihydrofolate
to tetrahydrofolate in mammals (blakley and benkovic,
1984). reduced folates serve as cofactors for enzymes involved in thymidylate synthesis and de novo purine synthesis
(blakley and benkovic, 1984). rapidly dividing cells are
therefore reliant upon reduced folates for cell division, and
depletion of reduced folates by drugs such as the antifolates
mtx and tmtx results in cell death. substitutions in
dhfr, particularly at position 22 or 31, render the enzyme
resistant to antifolates while retaining a variable level of
catalytic activity (morris and mcivor, 1994). this has led to
the use of variant dhfrs as dominant selectable markers in
vitro (simonsen and levinson, 1983) and for chemoprotection

in vivo selection of dhfr transgenic stem cells

of animals and selection in vivo (williams et al., 1987; corey
et al., 1990; may et al., 1995; james et al., 1997; allay et al.,
1998). however, the potency of antifolates can be interrupted
by the salvage of preformed nucleosides, thus providing nucleotide precursors that enter metabolic pathways distal to
the site of action of the antifolates (cabral et al., 1984; nelson
and drake, 1984). this circumvention of antifolate toxicity
can be reversed, however, by the use of agents such as  xxxd1914xxx  or nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside (cabral et
al., 1984; nelson and drake, 1984; allay et al., 1997; warlick
et al., 2000) to inhibit nucleoside transport. allay et al. (1997)
found that nucleoside transport inhibition could be used to
sensitize murine hematopoietic stem cells to the antifolate
tmtx in vivo. this led directly to the demonstration that
murine hematopoietic stem cells transduced with the tyr22
variant of human dhfr could be selected in vivo using the
combination of tmtx and nbmpr-p (allay et al., 1998).
in this study we corroborate the results of allay et al.
(1998) by demonstrating in vivo selection of murine hematopoietic stem cells in mice transplanted with bone marrow
transgenic for drug-resistant dhfr. primary recipient mice
treated with tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p demonstrated a 2- to 3-fold
increase in transgene signal in bone marrow, spleen, and
peripheral blood when assayed by quantitative southern
analysis 5 months following drug administration. analysis of
secondary transplant recipients derived from primary recipient mice treated with tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p demonstrated
increased levels of transgene-positive cells in marrow, peripheral blood, and spleens of these mice, indicative of expanded transgenic stem cells in the primary recipients, despite using a dose of tmtx less than one-third the dose of
previously reported studies (allay et al., 1998).

materials and methods
mice. female transgenic fvb/n mice expressing the tyr22 variant of murine dhfr were used in this study as a source of drugresistant marrow for bone marrow transplant studies and have been
previously described (james et al., 1997). age-matched normal
fvb/n male mice were used as a source of nontransgenic competitor
marrow in bone marrow transplant studies. recipient mice in bone
marrow transplant studies were normal fvb/n female mice aged 8
to 10 weeks. normal fvb/n mice were obtained from the national
institutes of health facility at frederick, md. all mice were provided
with food and water ad libitum. all animal work was approved by the
university of minnesota animal care committee and carried out in
accordance with university of minnesota animal care guidelines.
bone marrow transplantation. for primary bone marrow
transplants, donor marrow was harvested from tyr22 dhfr transgenic mice [line 11 (james et al., 1997)] and normal mice by flushing
tibiae and femurs with iscove’s modified dulbecco’s medium without
supplements. marrow from transgenic and normal donors was then
mixed so as to contain 10% transgenic cells. a total of 1 ⫻ 107 viable
marrow cells were transplanted in 0.5 ml of iscove’s modified dulbecco’s medium via lateral tail vein injection into female recipient
mice (experiment day 1) lethally irradiated (850 rad) the previous
day. transplanted marrow was allowed to engraft in primary recipient mice for 128 days before beginning drug administration (see
below). secondary bone marrow transplants were carried out using
donor marrow harvested from primary recipient mice as described
above. total bone marrow cells (5 ⫻ 106) were injected into the
lateral tail vein of female recipient mice lethally (850 rad) irradiated
the previous day.
drug administration. nbmpr-p and tmtx in the form of
 xxxd3442xxx  glucuronate were kindly provided by drs. brian sor-

rentino and james allay (st. jude’s medical center, memphis, tn).
both drugs were solubilized in sterile water. tmtx was administered at doses ranging from 20 to 100 mg/kg as a subcutaneous
injection, and nbmpr-p was administered at 20 mg/kg as an i.p.
injection. phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) was given as an i.p. injection.
in vitro hematopoietic cell culture. total marrow cells were
plated in 0.9% base  xxxd2609xxx  (h4100) (stem cell technologies, vancouver, bc, canada) supplemented with 30% newborn calf
serum (summit biotechnology, ft. collins, co), 0.5% bovine serum
albumin (stem cell technologies), 0.1 mm  xxxd26xxx  (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca), 5% hemostim (stem cell technologies), 3
u/ml recombinant human erythropoietin (r & d systems, minneapolis, mn), and in the presence or absence of 50 nm mtx [(⫹) xxxd2600xxx ; sigma, st. louis, mo]. between 2 and 5 ⫻ 104 cells
were plated per 3-cm plate. samples for each mouse were plated in
triplicate at each drug concentration, incubated at 37°c and 5% co2
in a humidified chamber, and counted on day 14. results are reported as the percentage of transgene engraftment, calculated by
determining the ratio of the number of colonies in the presence
versus absence of mtx for each sample and dividing it by the ratio of
colonies in the presence versus absence of mtx for a line 11 transgenic control mouse (defined as 100%) and multiplying by 100. standard deviations for each triplicate plating were less than 20% unless
otherwise noted.
white blood cell counts. peripheral blood was obtained from
drug-treated primary recipient mice upon sacrifice 24 h following the
last drug administration. blood was collected and diluted, and red
cells were lysed using the unopette collection system (bd biosciences, franklin lakes, nj) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. total white blood cells were then counted using a hemocytometer.
southern analysis and quantitation. dna was extracted from
marrow and spleen as previously described (james et al., 1997). dna
was isolated from peripheral blood samples using the puregene dna
isolation kit (pharmacia, piscataway, nj) as per the manufacturer’s
instructions. dna samples were digested with bglii restriction enzyme (invitrogen), separated on 0.8% agarose, and transferred to a
positively charged nytran plus (schleicher & schuell, keene, nh)
membrane. the blots were then probed with a [32p]dctp (amersham biosciences, arlington heights, il)-labeled fragment generated by polymerase chain reaction from the murine dhfr gene,
which hybridizes to both the endogenous and transgenic dhfr
sequences, and which has been described previously (james et al.,
1997). quantitation of radioactive signals from southern blots was
carried out using a 445si phosphorimager (molecular dynamics,
sunnyvale, ca). the percentage of transgene engraftment was calculated as the ratio of transgenic dhfr signal to endogenous dhfr
signal in each sample divided by the ratio of transgenic dhfr signal
to endogenous dhfr signal in a transgenic control animal (defined
as 100%) ⫻ 100.
statistical analysis. statistical comparison between different
groups of animals was carried out using analysis of variance (statview v.5.0.1; sas institute inc., cary, nc). probability values less
than 0.05 were considered significant.

results
the purpose of this study was to investigate whether
tmtx administration with or without nucleoside transport
inhibition could be used to mediate the selective outgrowth of
marrow cells transgenic for tyr22 drug-resistant dhfr.
we first tested the toxic effects of tmtx in female fvb/n
mice. animals were given subcutaneous injections of tmtx
at doses ranging from 20 to 100 mg/kg once daily for 5 days,
monitoring the animals for survival and weight loss. we
found that in this strain of mice, wild-type animals suc-

cumbed to tmtx at doses of 80 mg/kg and greater in approximately 8 days (table 1). of the tmtx doses tested, 60 mg/kg
was the maximally tolerated dose resulting in survival of
most animals following a 5-day treatment course (table 1).
to test whether the nucleoside transport inhibitor prodrug
nbmpr-p exacerbated tmtx toxicity in fvb/n mice, tmtx
was administered at 40 and 60 mg/kg subcutaneously for 5
days with or without 20 mg/kg nbmpr-p administered as an
i.p. injection, again monitoring daily for survival and weight
loss. as shown in table 2, nbmpr-p exacerbated the toxicity
of tmtx in fvb/n mice. whereas one-third of the mice given
60 mg/kg tmtx alone survived, all of the mice administered
tmtx at this dose died when nbmpr-p was coadministered
(table 2). nbmpr-p administration also reduced the survival of animals administered 40 mg/kg tmtx from three of
three to two of three (table 2). based upon these observations, tmtx and nbmpr-p were administered at 40 and 20
mg/kg, respectively, in the experiments described below.
to generate a cohort of mice for in vivo selection studies,
bone marrow transplants were conducted with marrow containing 10% tyr22 dhfr transgenic cells. female fvb/n
mice were transplanted with 1 ⫻ 107 total bone marrow cells,
1 ⫻ 106 of which were derived from a syngeneic transgenic
mouse line that expresses the tyr22-variant murine dhfr.
the remaining competitor cells were derived from normal
fvb/n mice. primary recipient mice were allowed to engraft
for 4 months (fig. 1). following engraftment, recipient mice
were divided into four groups and administered either pbs,
tmtx alone at 40 mg/kg, nbmpr-p alone at 20 mg/kg, or
tmtx and nbmpr-p for 5 days. both tmtx-administered
groups exhibited hematopoietic toxicity, as indicated by a
significant reduction in white blood cell count observed between animals administered pbs (9.3 ⫻ 103 cells/␮l) and
either tmtx alone [2.9 ⫻ 103 cells/␮l (**p ⬍ 0.01)] or tmtx
⫹ nbmpr-p [2.3 ⫻ 103 cells/␮l (**p ⬍ 0.01)]. we thus concluded that the doses of tmtx used, either alone or in comtable 2

bination with nbmpr-p, demonstrated appreciable hematopoietic toxicity in fvb/n mice and therefore may render
early progenitors or stem cells susceptible to selection.
to determine the effect that the various drug treatments
had on the level of transgenic dhfr-expressing cells present
in primary recipient mice, three animals from each group
were sacrificed 24 h following drug administration. peripheral blood, spleen, and bone marrow were harvested from the
animals, isolating dna for quantitative southern analysis.
protection from antifolate treatment was apparent from the
higher percentage of dhfr transgene-positive cells in the
marrow of animals treated with either tmtx (**p ⬍ 0.01
versus nbmpr-p alone or pbs) or tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p (*p ⬍
0.05 versus nbmpr-p alone or pbs) (table 3). tmtx- and
tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p-treated mice exhibited an average of 20
to 30% transgene-positive cells in the marrow, a 3- to 4-fold
increase over the level of transgene engraftment detected in
animals administered pbs or nbmpr-p alone (table 3). no
relative increase in the level of transgene was observed in the
spleen or peripheral blood (data not shown). thus, although
tmtx given with or without nbmpr-p was toxic to the
hematopoietic system as a whole, the protective effects of the
tyr22 dhfr transgene, at least in the period immediately
following drug administration, were more pronounced in the
marrow than in the spleen or peripheral blood.
the effect of drug administration on more primitive progenitor cells in primary recipients was determined in animals allowed to recover for 5 months following drug administration. dna was isolated from marrow, spleen, and
peripheral blood, and then subjected to quantitative southern analysis as described under materials and methods. in
the marrow, there was a statistically significant increase in

marrow 24 h following the last drug administration. blots were probed with a
fragment of the murine dhfr gene that identifies both the endogenous dhfr gene
and the transgenic dhfr gene as described under materials and methods, and
signals were quantified using a phosphorimager.

in vivo selection of dhfr transgenic stem cells

the level of transgene-positive cells in tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-ptreated mice relative to all other groups (fig. 2). the average
level of transgene-positive cells for animals treated with both
drugs was 10.4% compared with averages of 4.9% for pbstreated mice, 4.8% for nbmpr-p-treated mice, and 4.1% for
mice treated with tmtx alone (table 4) (*p ⬍ 0.05 versus all
three groups), suggesting that tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p selectively expanded tyr22 transgenic progenitor cells.
marrow obtained from three animals in each group of
drug-administered primary recipients was also plated into
 xxxd2609xxx  culture to assay for colony formation in the
absence and presence of 50 nm mtx. there was a trend
toward higher engraftment levels in the tmtx ⫹ nbmprp-treated mice compared with the other groups, although
these differences were not statistically significant (table 4).
in general, the frequency of drug-resistant colony formation
for any given animal correlated well with the level of transgene engraftment observed in the marrow and peripheral
blood as determined by quantitative southern analysis (fig.
3). furthermore, since a selective effect was maintained for 5
months after drug administration, this implies that observed
increases in transgene level occurred at the level of primitive
progenitors and, perhaps, stem cells.
mice treated with tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p contained higher
levels of dhfr transgene than did pbs-treated mice in the
spleen (*p ⬍ 0.05), and there was a trend toward higher
engraftment levels in peripheral blood, although this difference was not statistically significant (fig. 3). a significant
difference in transgene level was also observed in the spleen
between mice treated with tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p and mice
treated with tmtx alone (**p ⬍ 0.01); however, no significant difference was observed in the spleen between animals
treated with nbmpr-p alone and those treated with tmtx
⫹ nbmpr-p. assessed engraftment levels were consistent
from tissue to tissue for any given animal. mice that demonstrated high levels of engraftment in the marrow generally
also exhibited high levels in the two peripheral compartments (peripheral blood and spleen) that were assayed, although the absolute level of engraftment was somewhat
lower in the spleen than in either the marrow or peripheral
blood (fig. 3; table 4). the observed increases in transgenepositive cells in marrow, spleen, and peripheral blood of mice
treated with tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p relative to other groups
suggested preferential contribution from very early transgenic progenitor or stem cells to long-term hematopoiesis in
these animals.

to further evaluate in vivo antifolate-mediated selection
at the stem cell level, secondary transplants were conducted using marrow obtained from animals 1 day or 5
months following administration of pbs, tmtx,
nbmpr-p, or both tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p. recipients of marrow obtained 1 day after drug administration were allowed
to engraft for 7 months before harvesting bone marrow,
spleen, and peripheral blood. low levels of transgenic cell
engraftment (group averages ⬍ 3%) were observed by
quantitative southern analysis of peripheral blood, marrow, and spleen in all groups of these secondary recipients
(data not shown), and drug-resistant colony formation of
marrow cells plated in  xxxd2609xxx  culture was negligible (data not shown). furthermore, there was no detectable difference in transgene engraftment level or drugresistant colony formation among any of the treatment
groups. transgenic stem cell selection was thus not observed in secondary recipients when transplanted immediately following drug administration.
in contrast, secondary recipients of marrow obtained
from animals 5 months after drug administration exhibited substantially higher levels of transgenic cell engraftment. in marrow, the average transgene engraftment levels for all of the groups ranged from 10 to 13% except for
the pbs-administered control group, which was 4.7% (table 4). interestingly, however, average transgene engraftment levels in the spleen and peripheral blood for the
tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p group were 31.2 and 21.1%, respectively (table 4). by comparison, the nbmpr-p, pbs, and
tmtx-only groups each exhibited lower mean engraftment
levels (table 4). statistically significant differences were
observed between the tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p group and the
pbs group (*p ⬍ 0.05 in the spleen, *p ⬍ 0.05 in peripheral
blood) and between the tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p group and the
nbmpr-p-only group (*p ⬍ 0.05 in spleen, *p ⬍ 0.05 in
peripheral blood). assuming a baseline engraftment level
of 5% (the approximate transgene engraftment level for
pbs-treated primary recipients at 5 months), four of five
peripheral blood samples and five of five spleen samples
exhibited at least a 2-fold increase in transgene-positive
cells in the tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p group (table 4). marrow
cells from these secondary transplant recipients were also
plated in  xxxd2609xxx  culture in the presence and absence of mtx to assay for the presence of drug-resistant
progenitor cells. although statistical significance was not
observed between any of the groups, two of five secondary
recipients from the tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p group demonstrated transgene engraftment levels approximately 2-fold
higher than that achieved by any other mouse in any
group, reaching 50% in one case (table 4). this suggested
selective expansion of drug-resistant progenitors in these
animals. the relative levels of transgene-positive cells determined by colony-forming assay again correlated well
with quantitative southern analyses for individual mice.
taken together, the engraftment levels assessed by southern analysis and the results from analysis of drug-resistant colony formation in samples obtained from secondary
transplant recipients indicated effective in vivo selection of
variant dhfr transgenic hematopoietic stem cells using a
combination of tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p.

marrow was plated in  xxxd2609xxx  culture in the presence or absence of 50 nm mtx to enumerate colony-forming cells. percentage of transgene engraftment was
calculated from this assay as described under materials and methods. the standard deviations for each triplicate plating of the colony-forming assays were no greater than
20% except for the third mouse in the primary recipient tmtx group (33%), the second mouse in the primary recipient nbmpr-p group (22%), and the second mouse in the
primary recipient pbs group (45%). statistical comparisons between groups are noted in the text.

discussion
in this study we investigated the use of tmtx with and
without nucleoside transport inhibition to selectively expand
hematopoietic stem cells expressing a drug-resistant tyr22variant dhfr transgene. increased levels of transgene-positive cells were documented in marrow, spleen, and peripheral blood in primary recipients. this enrichment,
approximately 2- to 3-fold over controls, was stable for up to
5 months after drug treatment and translated into an increased number of drug-resistant progenitors as assayed by
colony formation in  xxxd2609xxx  culture. secondary recipients transplanted with marrow harvested 5 months after
treatment of donor mice with tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p exhibited
increased levels of transgene-positive cells in the marrow,
spleen, and peripheral blood in comparison to control animals. we therefore conclude that the combination of tmtx ⫹
nbmpr-p selectively expands tyr22 dhfr-positive hematopoietic stem cells.
one of the current problems in gene therapy is the challenge of expressing genes of interest in clinically significant
numbers of cells. adenovirus vectors are able to transduce
large numbers of cells, but only transiently. in addition, the
immunogenicity of these vectors makes readministration
problematic. retroviral vectors such as those derived from

moloney murine leukemia virus integrate into host cells, but
efficient integration requires host cell replication. because
hematopoietic stem cells replicate infrequently, stable transduction with oncornavirus vectors is problematic. this has
led to the investigation of stem cell transduction with alternative vectors such as adeno-associated virus (ponnazhagan
et al., 1997)- and human immunodeficiency virus-based vectors (miyoshi et al., 1999). modification of stem cell culture
conditions may also ultimately improve transduction frequency (kiem et al., 1998).
another potential strategy for increasing the frequency of
genetically modified cells is a selective strategy that enriches
for those cells expressing a selectable function introduced by
genetic modification. there are several advantages to in vivo
versus in vitro selection strategies. hematopoietic progenitors can be expanded and selected in culture with the use of
cytokines, but this in vitro approach can result in the loss of
primitive stem cell phenotype (hutchings et al., 1998). in
contrast, in vivo selective expansion of genetically modified
cells minimizes the length of time in culture and thus the
potential loss of primitive progenitors. theoretically, genemodified cells could be selectively expanded to therapeutic
levels from even a very low level of engraftment. recent data
from this laboratory and others have shown that severe my-

signals obtained from each southern blot was carried out and the percentage of transgene engraftment was calculated as described under

groups of mice are shown.

eloablation protocols may not be necessary to allow low-level
engraftment of gene-modified cells (mardiney and malech,
1996; james et al., 2000). in vivo selection might thus be used
in conjunction with mild preconditioning to spare patients
from the exposure to severe myeloablative conditions and
still achieve significant engraftment of gene-modified cells.
the human multidrug resistance 1 gene (mdr-1) has been
used to selectively expand the levels of hematopoietic cells
transduced with an mdr-1 vector in vitro (blau et al., 1997)
and in vivo (sorrentino et al., 1992). in vivo selection has also
been investigated using dna alkyltransferase genes to confer resistance to dna-alkylating agents including selection
of hematopoietic stem cells from a very low frequency (davis
et al., 1997, 2000). although the mdr-1 selection system has
demonstrated selection of differentiated blood cells, evidence
for selection of stem cells has not been described.
in this paper we corroborate the results of allay et al.
(1997, 1998), demonstrating the utility of using nucleoside
transport inhibition in combination with tmtx to selectively
expand hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells that express
variant dhfr activity in a transgenic mouse model. our

55

results were obtained after a single 5-day course of treatment, the effects of which were observed out to 5 months in
primary recipients and up to nearly 6 months in secondary
transplant recipients.
we found that 40 mg/kg tmtx with 20 mg/kg nbmpr-p
was the maximally tolerated dose of these drugs in wild-type
fvb/n mice. thus, the in vivo selection results reported here
were obtained using a dose of tmtx (40 mg/kg) approximately one-third of that dose (100 –130 mg/kg) used by allay
et al. (1997, 1998) in c57bl/6j mice. determining the minimal effective dose of antifolate will be important to minimize
toxicity of selective treatment. we have also observed that
fvb/n mice transgenic for variant dhfr or transplanted
with variant dhfr transgenic marrow can tolerate significantly higher doses of antifolate than normal animals (may
et al., 1995; james et al., 1997).
the marrow of primary recipients receiving tmtx or
tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p demonstrated a 3- to 4-fold higher transgene signal compared with pbs- or nbmpr-p- administered
mice when assayed 1 day after drug administration. the
resulting average levels of transgene-positive cells for antifolate-administered mice were between 20 and 30%. however, when marrow was examined in primary recipient mice
5 months after drug administration, transgene engraftment
levels for tmtx ⫹ nbmpr-p-treated mice had decreased to
an average of 10.5%, and had decreased to 4.1% in mice
treated with tmtx alone. the level of transgene-positive
cells observed immediately after antifolate treatment most
likely represents selection of committed hematopoietic cells.
over time, however, the committed progenitors presumably
exhausted their replicative potential and were lost from the
population, resulting in a lower transgene engraftment level
indicative of the level of transgene-positive early-progenitor
or stem cells present.
the tyr22-transgenic dhfr mice used as a source of drugresistant marrow for these studies have been described previously (line 11) (james et al., 1997). despite the presence of
approximately 24 copies of the transgene per cell, the amount
of messenger rna derived from the transgene in bone marrow was found to be about 20% that of the endogenous dhfr
message level as determined by ribonuclease protection assay (james et al., 1997). spencer et al. (1996) found that the
in vivo level of myeloprotection from tmtx was correlated
with the tyr22 dhfr proviral copy number in peripheral
blood cells of mice transplanted with transduced marrow. it
is likely that higher expression levels of the variant dhfr,
achievable either through transduction of marrow using viral
vectors with strong heterologous promoters or a different line
of transgenic mice expressing a higher transgene level, might
result in more effective chemoprotection and a greater degree
of in vivo selection. thus far, only the tyr22 form of dhfr
has been tested for selection in vivo. other forms of dhfr
which confer greater resistance to antifolates may prove even
more effective for in vivo selection than tyr22.
in this study we have shown that transgenic hematopoietic
stem cells expressing tyr22 dhfr can be selectively expanded in vivo using the antifolate tmtx and the nucleoside
transport inhibitor prodrug nbmpr-p. further studies are
being conducted to address optimal drug dosing schedules as
well as the minimum level of transgene engraftment that can
be successfully expanded in vivo in this system. application
of this strategy could be beneficial for treatment of genetic

warlick et al.

diseases by gene transfer into hematopoietic cells. in vivo
expansion of such a population of gene-modified cells expressing both a selective and a therapeutic gene could result
in an improved therapeutic benefit. furthermore, increased
levels of gene-modified cells achieved through in vivo selection may provide a greater degree of chemoprotection, allowing for more aggressive antitumor chemotherapy. in vivo
selection is thus a promising strategy in the continuing maturation of human gene therapy.
