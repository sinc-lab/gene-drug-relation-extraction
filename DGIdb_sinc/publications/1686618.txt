summary
the active conformation of several histamine hi-antagonists is investigated. as a template molecule we
used the antagonist  xxxd1785xxx , which consists of a piperidylene ring connected to a tricyclic system.
the piperidylene moiety is shown to be flexible. the global minimum is a chair conformation but, additionally, a second chair and various boat conformations have to be considered, as their energies are less than
5 kcal/mol above the energy of the global minimum. two semi-rigid histamine hi-antagonists,  xxxd2904xxx  and triprolidine, were fitted onto the various conformations of  xxxd1785xxx  in order to derive the
pharmacologically active conformation of  xxxd1785xxx . at the same time, the active conformation of
both  xxxd2904xxx  and triprolidine was derived. it is demonstrated that, within the receptor-bound conformation of  xxxd1785xxx , the piperidylene ring most probably exists in a boat form.

introduction
histamine hi-antagonists are important agents in the treatment of allergic disorders. although
many hi-antagonists are known and used, they all have some disadvantages in therapy, sedation
being one of them. in recent years some antagonists were marketed devoid of this side effect; currently, new antagonists are still being developed. however, this development is in most cases not
based on a model for the binding site of the histamine hi-receptor but on a rather classical way
of molecular manipulation. we therefore initiated the current programme. in this study we present results from modeling studies on the histamine hi-receptor, the active conformation of a
semi-rigid hi-antagonists  xxxd1785xxx , currently used as a preliminary model of the h~-receptor antagonist binding site.
hi-antagonists can structurally be divided into two classes, the classic and non-classic. the

classic antagonists all share the same basic chemical structure (fig. 1). they all contain two aromatic groups and a nitrogen function connected through a short chain, with a length of 3-4 carbon atoms. the nitrogen function usually is a tertiary amine, but quaternized compounds can also
be highly active [1]. removing one aromatic group reduces activity, while removing both aromatic groups leads to inactivity [2]. the nitrogen atom is important, as can be concluded from the optimal length of the connecting chain [3], and the fact that in this class of compounds no structures
without this nitrogen are reported to have important hi-antagonistic activity.
non-classic antagonists are structurally more diverse. generally, they have more than one aromatic group and a basic nitrogen atom. however, there are very active compounds known which
either lack a strong basic function (e.g. temelastine [4]) or have only one aromatic group (e.g.
benzimidazole derivatives [5]). in the former case, polar groups probably fulfil the same function
as the basic nitrogen atom, whereas in the latter case an additional hydrophobic chain is necessary
for high activity.
very little is known about the structure of the histamine hi-receptor. although recently the hireceptor has been expressed in xenopus oocytes [6], the receptor has not been isolated yet and the
dna sequence is not known. information on the binding site can then be obtained by comparing
the structures of the ligands acting on the receptor. until now, only a few studies have been published [7,8]. in these investigations the potent (pa2= 9 [9]) classic hi-antagonist  xxxd1785xxx 
(fig. 2) was used as a reference molecule to which other antagonists were compared. the reason
for choosing  xxxd1785xxx  as a reference molecule most probably was that this compound was
considered the most rigid hi-antagonist known at the moment. therefore, the receptor-bound
conformation of  xxxd1785xxx  might be very similar to the conformation as present in solution
or in crystallized form. an essential assumption in the two literature studies [7,8] on the hi-antagonist binding site was indeed that the receptor-bound conformation of  xxxd1785xxx  and the xray structure are similar.
in fig. 2 the structural formula of  xxxd1785xxx  is shown. it consists of a cycloheptatriene
ring fused to two benzenes and connected via a double bond to an n-methyl piperidylene group.
because of its cyclic nature and double bonds,  xxxd1785xxx  seems to be very rigid, and therefore the assumption that the crystal conformation mimics the receptor-bound conformation
seems reasonable. however, recently a conformational analysis study on  xxxd1785xxx  was
published [10], and from n m r studies in cdci3 the authors concluded that  xxxd1785xxx  can
assume at least two different conformations.
in the current study we aim to establish the biologically active conformation of  xxxd1785xxx 

359
acting on the histamine hi-receptor. we first want to point out that conformations other than the
two chair conformations of the piperidylene ring found in solution and in crystallized form should
be considered. these conformations will be of importance only if their energy is relatively low
compared to the global minimum of the molecule. the reason that conformations with a higher
energy in solution or in vacuo can still be the active conformation is that the receptor, by creating
an environment different from either solution or vacuo can stabilize these conformations. because
this receptor environment is not known, all low-energy conformations should be considered with
an energy within 5 kcal/mol from the calculated global minimum.
by fitting (superimposing) other semi-rigid ligands onto  xxxd1785xxx , one of the possible
conformations of  xxxd1785xxx  can be shown to be the biologically active conformation acting
on the hi-receptor. the results can be used for building a model of the hi-receptor binding site.
strategy
the strategy we followed in order to model the hi-receptor was to check the literature as to
whether  xxxd1785xxx  was still the most rigid hi-antagonist known with a high hi-antagonistic
activity. no other compound was found. we investigated the conformational flexibility of this
molecule. different low-energy conformations were considered as possible biologically active conformations. the three-dimensional (3d) arrangement of functional groups within the active conformation of  xxxd1785xxx  and other hi-antagonists will be similar. therefore, we looked for
other semi-rigid antagonists in literature and fitted these ( xxxd2904xxx  and triprolidine, pa2-values between 9 and 10 [11,12], fig. 3) on the various conformations of  xxxd1785xxx . the conformation of  xxxd1785xxx  on which both other antagonists can be fitted can be considered to be
the active conformation of  xxxd1785xxx .
to evaluate the quality of a fit, first the quality of the superimposition, and secondly the energy
of the fitted conformation relative to its global minimum energy, have to be established.
methods
general
all calculations on  xxxd1785xxx ,  xxxd2904xxx  and triprolidine were performed on the protonated species. initial geometries for  xxxd1785xxx  and triprolidine were taken from the cam-

bridge structural database [13,14], while  xxxd2904xxx  was built with the modeling package
chem-x* using crystal structure fragments.
the molecular mechanics program mmx** was used for conformational analysis studies on
triprolidine and  xxxd2904xxx . within mmx the charge-charge electrostatic interaction term
was used with a default dielectric constant of 1.5.
the semiempirical quantum mechanical method mndo implemented in mopac version 4.0
[15] was used for a final optimization of all structures. mndo optimizations were performed on
internal coordinates using the default optimiser until herbert's test was satisfied (using the keyword 'precise') or, if not possible, until all gradients were smaller than 1 kcal/mol/,~ or 1 kcal/
mol/rad.
the molecular modeling program chem-x was used for rigid and flexible fitting. the flexible
fitting minimiser uses the chem-x non-bonded energy force field. this consists of a van der
waals term (buckinham term (exp-6) [16,17]) and an electrostatic coulomb term [17] using charges from an mndo mulliken population analysis. the flexible fitting minimizations were carried
out using a quadratic gradient minimiser until the sum of gradients was smaller than 5 [17].
centroids of and planes through aromatic rings were defined by the corresponding six-ring
atoms.

flexibility of  xxxd1785xxx 
in this study, the flexibility of the tricyclic ring system of  xxxd1785xxx  was not examined.
this system is considered to be rigid because inversions of similar tricyclic ring systems are known
to have a high energy barrier [10,18]. assuming that the flexibility of  xxxd1785xxx  resides in the
piperidylene ring this flexibility can be accessed by a conformational analysis. however, a complete conformational analysis of ring structures is rather complicated, mainly because many different energy minima are present and it is difficult to locate them all [19]. therefore, we chose a
simpler approach and generated different ring conformations in analogy to cyclohexane. recently, an extensive conformational analysis of  xxxd1785xxx  has been performed (reaction-coordinate approach) by sadek et al. [10], which indeed indicates the existence of a multitude of possible
transition states and local minima.
using the molecular modeling package chem-x, we constructed the possible chair and boat
conformations for the piperidylene ring of  xxxd1785xxx  (fig. 4). one chair and three boat conformations are possible. as each ring conformation can be incorporated into  xxxd1785xxx  in
two ways, this results in two conformations with a chair piperidylene ring conformation and six
conformations with a boat piperidylene ring conformation (henceforth, 'boat' or 'chair' will refer
to the conformation of the complete molecule  xxxd1785xxx , and not only to the conformation
of the piperidylene ring). the six boat conformations contain two pairs of conformations which
are mirror images. in this study, we compared  xxxd1785xxx  with triprolidine and  xxxd2904xxx . as triprolidine is a non-chiral molecule, it is impossible to use triprolidine to distinguish
between two mirror images. for the chiral molecule  xxxd2904xxx , the absolute configuration of
the active isomer is unknown. therefore, we considered only one of the two mirror images, and

atoms are indicatedby a star.

thus four boat conformations remained. the two chair and four boat conformations (chair 1, 2
and boat 3 to 6) were optimized using the semiempirical method mndo.
it has to be noted that a large number of alternative twisted conformations is also possible.
however, as we found it impossible to investigate all these conformations whereas the position of
the nitrogen atom with respect to the aromatic rings will not vary much among several of these
conformations, we chose to investigate only four boat conformations. boat 3 and 4 were chosen,
as they represent (before geometry optimization) conformations with the position of the nitrogen
atom maximally different from that in the chair conformations. boats 5 and 6 represent conformations with the position of the nitrogen atom intermediate between those of the chair and boat
3 and 4 conformations.
the position of the n-methyl group is assumed not to be important for fitting, as both tertiary
amines in their protonated form as well as several quaternary ammonium ions are known to be
active compounds [1]. therefore, in the two chair conformations, the n-methyl group was placed
equatorially. axial conformations were not investigated, as this conformation generally has a
higher energy, and the position of the methyl group probably only has a minor effect on the conformation of the remainder of the molecule. also, in the boat conformations only one position for
the n-methyl was considered (fig. 4).

conformationalanalysis ofphenindamine and triprolidine
the conformational analyses of  xxxd2904xxx  and triprolidine were performed using the dihedral driver of the molecular mechanics program mmx. the dihedral driver systematically
drives selected dihedral angles with user-defined increments; each generated conformation is optimized, keeping only the chosen dihedral angle(s) fixed.
in the case of  xxxd2904xxx , the structure was first pre-optimized with mmx, whereafter the
exocyclic dihedral angle ~1 (fig. 3) was rotated with increments of 15Â°. subsequently, all low-energy conformations were fully optimized (including driven dihedral) within m m x and the lowestenergy conformation finally optimized within m n d o to give the global minimum conformation
and its energy.
the conformational analysis of triprolidine was performed sequentially and for the e-isomer
only (z-isomer is t000-fold less active [22]). first, dihedral angles zl and "{72 were examined, then
â¢ 2 and ~3, and finally ~3 and ~4 (fig. 3). this seems reasonable, since ~1 influences ~4 only slightly.
first triprolidine was pre-optimized with m m x and the result used as input for a conformational
analysis study on ~1 and "~2with increments of 60 Â° (the reason for this rather large increment was
the limited availability of disk space). next, dihedral angles ~2 and ~3 were varied. input for this
second conformational-analysis study were the lowest-energy conformations with different x  xxxd3483xxx -

362
ues resulting from the previous analysis. correspondingly, input for the third conformational
analysis on angles ~3 and z4 were the lowest-energy conformations with varying ~2 values generated by the second conformational analysis. all energetically allowed conformations resulting from
the third analysis were optimized with mmx, and the lowest-energy conformation was further
optimized with mndo to give the global minimum.
as molecular mechanics methods such as mmx are known to be less well suitable for highly
conjugated systems [21] such as  xxxd1785xxx , it was optimized with mndo. as  xxxd2904xxx 
and triprolidine were going to be fitted onto the mndo-optimized structure of  xxxd1785xxx ,
these structures were also finally optimized with mndo. the rational basis for this approach is
that different geometry optimization methods may give different values for optimal bond lengths
and bond angles, thereby influencing the results of the fits. the combination of two optimization
methods (mmx, mndo) may introduce only small errors in the localization of the global minima.
in the fitting procedures described in the next section, initially only exocyclic dihedral angles
were varied. in triprolidine the flexibility of the molecule can almost completely be described by
these angles. however, in case of  xxxd2904xxx  this is not completely true. as the distance between the basic nitrogen atom and the aromatic plane, which are both part of a tricyclic system,
might be important for fitting, we generated some non-minimum-energy conformations by varying endocyclic dihedral angle n1-c2-c3~ 4 (1:2) inside the tetrahydropyridine ring of  xxxd2904xxx  (fig. 3). this angle is mainly responsible for variations in the distance between the basic nitrogen atom and the aromatic plane. starting with the global minimum of  xxxd2904xxx  (x2 is
19Â°) and using the dihedral driver of mmx x2 was driven from 90 to - 9 0 degrees with increments
of 5 degrees. the resulting low-energy conformations were subsequently optimized with mndo
keeping z2 fixed. these structures were also used for fitting at a later stage.

fitting
the hi-antagonists  xxxd2904xxx  and triprolidine were fitted on the template  xxxd1785xxx .
the groups selected to be fitted were the basic nitrogen atom and the two aromatic rings, as it is
known that these groups are important for binding to the receptor (see introduction). the aromatic rings were represented by two dummy atoms 1.8 a above and below the centroids of the
ring (fig. 5). when these dummy atoms are fitted, not only the centroids of the aromatic rings
tend to be superimposed but also the aromatic planes are positioned in parallel. the advantage of
fitting dummy atoms instead of, for example, three carbon atoms of the aromatic rings, is that rotation around the axis perpendicular to the aromatic plane is not restrained.
compounds were fitted by first using a rigid fitting procedure, followed by a flexible fitting procedure. within the first procedure, the global minimum conformation of  xxxd2904xxx  and triprolidine was fitted onto  xxxd1785xxx  only allowing global rotations and translations. subsequently, in the flexible fitting procedure also user-defined exocyclic dihedral angles were
minimized with respect to restraints set by the user (see below) on the one hand, and the nonbonded energy of the fitted molecule on the other hand. for  xxxd2904xxx , dihedral angle t1was
minimized and for triprolidine, angles z2, ~3 and z4 (fig. 3). the fitted structures were subsequently optimized in mndo, optimizing all internal coordinates except for the dihedral angles adjusted in the flexible fitting procedure. finally, these optimized structures were superimposed on
 xxxd1785xxx  again, and distances between fitted groups and angles between planes determined.
within the fitting procedures, a restraint constant of 100 kcal/mol/a2 was used for the nitrogen

atoms to be matched, and a constant of 10 kcal/mol/.a 2 for the dummies representing the aromatic rings. the reason for not giving the nitrogen and d u m m y atoms equivalent restraint constants
is that the balance between fitting the nitrogen atom and the aromatic rings is not only determined
by this constant, but also by the distance chosen between the d u m m y atom and the centroid of the
corresponding ring (i.e. 1.8 ,&). we observed that, with these restraints, the nitrogen atom and the
aromatic rings could be fitted well.
to quantify the quality of the fit for the nitrogen atoms, we considered their distance when superimposed. the fit of the aromatic groups was quantified by the angle between the fitted planes
(pla i and pla ii) as well as the distance between the centroids of the rings (cen i and cen ii). ideally, these distances and angles should be zero. the energy of the fitted conformation should be
within 5 kcal/mol of the global minimum energy.
results

flexibility of  xxxd1785xxx 
in fig. 4, the six conformations of  xxxd1785xxx  chosen to be optimized by m n d o are presented. in table 1, the energies of the two chair and four boat conformations of  xxxd1785xxx 
after optimization with m n d o are shown. it can be seen that the chair 1 conformation o f c y p r o heptadine has the lowest energy. this chair conformation is also found in the crystal structure
[13]. the energy difference between the two chair conformations is only 0.6 kcal/mol. the boat
conformations have energies about 1.5 to 3.6 kcal/mol above the lowest-energy conformation.
only boat 5 has a real boat conformation in that bonds n1-c2 and c4-c5 run almost parallel (angle is 1Â°). the other three boat conformations are more or less twisted, as can be seen in table 2
from the differences in the distances between the opposing piperidylene ring atoms.
table 2 further demonstrates that the nitrogen atom lies in all six conformations approximately

the position o f the nitrogen atoms (distance is 1.6 ,~, table 3). examining table 3, it is evident
that chair 2 and b o a t 5 are identical with respect to the position o f the basic nitrogen a t o m (distance is only 0.08 ,a). assuming that only the relative positions o f the aromatic groups in the tricyclic system and the basic nitrogen a t o m o f  xxxd1785xxx  are i m p o r t a n t for hi-antagonistic

however, in b o a t 3, 4 and 6 the position o f the nitrogen a t o m relative to the tricyclic system is
very different from those in the chair conformations, and they also differ mutually. boats 4 and 6
were generated f r o m different conformations, but after optimizing with m n d o they appeared as
approximate mirror images, as can be seen from the same energies and equivalent geometric parameters (table 2). the nitrogen a t o m in either boat 4 or 6 has distances o f a b o u t 1.0 and 2.5

summarizing, five different c o n f o r m a t i o n s o f  xxxd1785xxx  were generated o f which four

we further investigated the effect o f decreasing the restrain constant on the distance between
the nitrogen atoms f r o m 100 to 40 kcal/mol/a 2 (see methods). the results are shown in table 5.
the aromatic groups are n o w fitted somewhat better, whereas the nitrogen is fitted worse. h o w ever, the fit on chair 2 is still not acceptable. therefore, we conclude that  xxxd2904xxx  cannot be
fitted correctly on either o f the two chair c o n f o r m a t i o n s o f  xxxd1785xxx .
because only a limited n u m b e r o f low-energy c o n f o r m a t i o n s o f  xxxd1785xxx  was investigated, it is in principal possible that also other c o n f o r m a t i o n s bind to the hi-receptor. however, as
in the case of  xxxd2904xxx  the position o f the basic nitrogen a t o m with respect to the aromatic
ring ii is nearly fixed (distance to its centroid is approx. 5.5 a, distance to its plane is approx. 0.4

with a distance much smaller than in boat 3 does not exist, other possibly active conformations of
 xxxd1785xxx  will at best give results similar to those of the boat 3 conformation. this strongly
suggests that boat 3 is the active conformation on the hi-receptor.
discussion

flexibility of  xxxd1785xxx 
from the minimization of the different chair and boat conformations (of  xxxd1785xxx ) it is
evident that the two chair conformations have the lowest energy. chair 1, which is similar to the
crystal structure [13], has an energy 0.6 kcal/mol lower than chair 2 (table 1). a similar result was
found by sadek et al. [10], using the semiempirical method am 1 (1.1 kcal/mol difference; protonated species; n-methyl equatorial). in the present study, the position of the n-methyl group in
the chair conformations was kept equatorial as this position is assumed to be favoured above the
axial position. sadek et al. [10] calculated the energies of the chair conformations both with the
methyl group in equatorial and in axial position, and the results confirmed our assumption. from
these results, the chair 1 conformation can be concluded to be the global minimum conformation
of  xxxd1785xxx .
in addition to the chair conformations, we also generated the low-energy boat 3, 4, 5 and 6 conformations. these conformations have an energy 1.5 to 3.6 kcal/mol above the global minimum
of  xxxd1785xxx  (table 1). these differences are small compared to the differences found in
cyclohexane between chair, and twisted-boat or boat conformations (5 to 6.5 kcal/mol [22]).
however, it is known that in six-membered rings other than cyclohexane these energy differences
can be smaller [22]. in case of  xxxd1785xxx  an interaction between the protonated nitrogen and
the ~-electrons of the double bond c4-c 7 (fig. 2) may stabilize boat conformations relative to the
chairs. also the presence of an sp 2 carbon atom (c4) in the ring may stabilize boat conformations
because of the reduced torsional barrier of the spz-sp 3 bonds [22]. as the boat conformations of
cyclohexane are more than 5 kcal/mol higher in energy than the chair conformations, in modeling

3 (c d) conformations(seealso table 4). the fit on boat 3 givesthe best results.
studies on six-membered rings usually only the chair conformations are considered. however,
from the present study it can be concluded that the energies of the boat conformations are sufficiently low to be energetically accessible, and have to be considered as possible active conformations. indeed, our results point to boat 3 as the active conformation on the hi-receptor.
beside being an hi-antagonist,  xxxd1785xxx  also is an antagonist at other receptors, e.g. serotonine-s2 and acetylcholine m-receptors [23]~ until recently,  xxxd1785xxx  was assumed to be
rigid and to bind to all these receptors in a conformation similar to the crystal structure [7,8,24].
however, sadek et al. [10] already pointed out that two chair conformations of  xxxd1785xxx 
are present in solution, and therefore both have to be taken into account when considering the active conformation of  xxxd1785xxx . our study indicates that other conformations of  xxxd1785xxx  also have to be considered. therefore, the assumption that the three functional groups of
 xxxd1785xxx  (two aromatic rings and a basic nitrogen atom) are arranged similarly after binding to either of the different receptors is not necessarily valid, and the active conformation of  xxxd1785xxx  has to be derived separately for each receptor.

histamine hi-receptor antagonist binding site
by fitting the functional groups of hi-antagonists on  xxxd1785xxx  we determined that the
boat 3 conformation of  xxxd1785xxx  is its active conformation on the hi-receptor antagonist
binding site. the rationale behind superimposing functional groups is that these groups bind to
the same receptor locations, implying that the antagonists themselves bind to the same receptor
site.
it is experimentally difficult, even impossible, to verify whether antagonists bind to the same or
to different receptor sites. for example, most hi-antagonists are competitive, but some compounds display non-competitive antagonism towards the hi-receptor (e.g.  xxxd1785xxx  [9]).
however, these data do not give a decisive answer to the question whether these different antagonists bind to the same receptor site. in the case of  xxxd1785xxx , its non-competitive nature [9]
can be explained by its very slow dissociation rate from the hi-receptor 01/2 > > 90 min [25]).
however, in some cases modeling studies can be helpful. as the semi-rigid compounds investigated in this study can be fitted onto each other, this suggests that these antagonists bind to the same
site.
so far only a few modeling studies have been carried out on the hi-receptor. in 1986, borea et
al. [7] compared the crystal structures of 14 hi-antagonists and calculated the distance between
the centroid of one of the aromatic rings and the basic nitrogen atom to be 6.2_+ 0.2 a. also, after
optimizing the crystal structures this distance did not change. the authors concluded that, for a
high hi-antagonistic activity, the distance between the basic nitrogen atom and the centroid
should be close to the above value of 6.2 a.
in 1985, naruto et al. [8] defined a more detailed model of the hi-binding site by fitting seven
potent hi-antagonists and histamine itself onto each other. in their study, the centroids of two aromatic rings and the protonated nitrogen were fitted. all compounds (including  xxxd1785xxx )
were minimized simultaneously with additional restraints for the atoms to be fitted. within this
procedure the crystal structure of  xxxd1785xxx  was minimized. therefore, it is not surprising
that in the final model the conformation of  xxxd1785xxx  is similar to this x-ray structure, as in
a minimization procedure usually no high energy barriers can be taken. furthermore, it appears
to be difficult to evaluate the quality of the study: although all compounds could be fitted in a lowenergy conformation, no data on the quality of the fits were presented.
the main drawback of the above studies is the fact that the authors assume the crystal structure
conformation (or a similar conformation) of  xxxd1785xxx  to be the active conformation. a second drawback is that the aromatic groups were considered to be one-dimensional points (centroids). obviously, when the aromatic planes of different antagonists interact with the receptor,
these planes will be oriented in a similar way (coplanar), which cannot be achieved by only using
centroids. therefore, in the present study not only the distance between fitted centroids was considered but also the angle between fitted aromatic planes.
another improvement of this study is that three semi-rigid antagonists,  xxxd1785xxx ,  xxxd2904xxx  and triprolidine, were investigated. although in the above-mentioned modeling studies
on the hi-receptor, more antagonists were taken into account, the only semi-rigid antagonists
considered were  xxxd1785xxx  and triprolidine. because of the high flexibility of the remaining
antagonists, it is very probable that these will also fit into the model we present, but probably also
on any other postulated receptor model. preliminary studies on some of these compounds (such
as diphenhydramines, di-aryl-aminopropanes) have already shown that these can be fitted in our
model. the results of these studies will be published in the near future.
