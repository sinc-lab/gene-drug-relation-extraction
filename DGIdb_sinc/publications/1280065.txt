previously,
we demonstrated
that the heymann
nephritis autoantigen,
 xxxg1342xxx , can serve as a receptor site
for plasminogen.
this binding
was not significantly
inhibited
by the lysine
analogue
t-amino
caproic
acid
( xxxd146xxx ), indicating
that plasminogen
binding was not just
through lysine binding sites as suggested for other plasminogen binding
sites. we now report that once plasminogen is bound to  xxxg1342xxx , it can be converted
to its
active form of plasmin by urokinase.
this conversion
of
plasminogen
to plasmin proceeds at a faster rate when
plasminogen
is first prebound
to  xxxg1342xxx . although
there
is a proportional
increase in the v,,, of the urokinasecatalyzed reaction with increasing
 xxxg1342xxx  concentrations,
no change in k, was observed. once activated,
plasmin
remains bound to  xxxg1342xxx  in an active state capable of
cleaving the chromogenic
tripeptide,
s-2251. the binding of plasmin to  xxxg1342xxx  did not significantly
change its
enzymatic activity;
however,  xxxg1342xxx  did have a stabilizing
effect on plasmin activity
at 37°c. while bound to  xxxg1342xxx ,
plasmin is protected
from inactivation
by its natural inhibitor cy,-antiplasmin.
the binding of plasmin to  xxxg1342xxx 
as analyzed by elba
was shown to be time dependent,
reversible,
saturable,
and specific for  xxxg1342xxx . inhibition
of binding of both plasminogen
and plasmin to  xxxg1342xxx  by
 xxxd302xxx 
was similar,
although
 xxxd146xxx  inhibited
the
binding of plasmin to  xxxg1342xxx  slightly
more than the binding of plasminogen
to  xxxg1342xxx . these results indicate that
the binding of plasminogen
to  xxxg1342xxx  serves as an effective
means of increasing
the rate of plasmin production
on
the glomerular
and tubular epithelial
cell surface while
protecting
the active plasmin
from natural
inhibitors.

shown the binding of plasminogen to a kidney protein,
 xxxg1342xxx , also known as the heymann nephritis autoantigen
(6). this large glycoprotein is located on the glomerular
and tubular epithelial cells (7) and has been purified from
both rat and human kidney (8).  xxxg1342xxx  has been implicated
as the major autoantigen of heymann nephritis, which
serves as the accepted morphological model for the human
disease idiopathic membranous glomerulonephritis
(911). the exact manner in which autoantibodies to this
protein alter the permeability of the glomerular basement
membrane leading to proteinuria is not known.
plasminogen is converted in uiuo to the active enzyme
plasmin primarily by urokinase in the extravascular space.
urokinase receptors have been found on several different
cell types, including glomerular epithelial cells (12-14).
once activated, plasmin serves as a broad-spectrum serine
protease capable of cleaving fibrin (15), fibronectin (16),
thrombospondin (17), laminin (16),  xxxg2423xxx 
(18), and activating enzymes such as collagenase (19). in
addition to fibrinolysis, plasmin has been shown to be
involved in cell migration (20), inflammation
(21), ovulation and implantation (22), and neurodevelopment (23).
we now report the finding that not only plasminogen
but also plasmin can bind to  xxxg1342xxx . we have also analyzed
the activation of plasminogen bound to  xxxg1342xxx  by urokinase as well as the inhibition of plasmin bound to  xxxg1342xxx 
by its natural inhibitor a,-antiplasmin.

rat  xxxg1342xxx  was purified from rat kidney using
 xxxd1835xxx  detergent solubilization,
gel filtration, and lens culinaris
agglutinin affinity chromatography
as previously described (24-26).
plasminogen was purified from rat plasma (pel freeze, rogers, ar)
using a lysine-agarose affinity column (sigma, st. louis, mo) by the
method of deutsch and mertz (27) as previously described (6). analysis

and nonreducing conditions showed the preparations contained both
carbohydrate forms i and ii of glu-plasminogen
(6). rat plasmin was
obtained by incubating 4 ml of rat plasminogen (l-2 mg/ml) in 50 mm
hepes, ph 7.4, with immobilized urokinase for 30 min at 25°c. the
immobilized urokinase preparation was obtained by binding 9 mg of
human urokinase containing
approximately
100,000 plough units
(sigma) with 2 ml of affi-gel 10 (bio-rad, richmond, ca) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. full conversion of plasminogen to
plasmin was confirmed by no further increase in plasmin activity as
measured by the s-2251 chromogenic assay with additional urokinase
incubation. also, no plasminogen could be detected by western analysis
of reduced and nonreduced plasmin preparations run on sds-page
and analyzed with our rabbit polyclonal antibody to plasminogen. plasminogen is of higher molecular weight than plasmin on nonreduced gels
and plasmin gives two bands on reduced gels vs one band for plasminogen. plasminogen and plasmin protein concentrations were determined
spectrophotometrically
at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 16.8
(l%, 1 cm) and molecular weights of 94,000 for plasminogen and 84,000
for plasmin (28, 29).
elisa.
our basic elisa protocol previously stated was used (6).
proteins were coated onto polystyrene microtiter plates (immulon, dynatech, chantilly, va) at 5 pg/ml in 5 mm carbonate/bicarbonate
buffer,
ph 9.6. the plates were blocked with 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa)
in phosphate-buffered
saline (pbs) for 30 min at 25°c and plasmin was
added with and without various inhibitors. initially, high background
values of plasmin binding to bsa-coated control wells were observed.
this was presumably due to the cleavage of bsa by the active plasmin
and the formation of plasmin lysine binding sites. this background
could be eliminated by the preincubation
of plasmin with 50 pg/ml
aprotinin, a tight binding inhibitor of plasmin. the binding of aprotinin
to plasmin did not affect the subsequent binding of plasmin to  xxxg1342xxx 
as measured by elisa, and therefore, all binding studies contained
aprotinin inhibited plasmin. background binding of aprotinin-inhibited
plasmin to bsa control wells was subtracted from all values. detection
of plasmin binding was with our rabbit anti-plasminogen
antibody
(1:5000) followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit igg antibody
(1:20,000) (cappel, malvern, pa). color was developed using 2.5 mm ophenylenediamine, 0.006%  xxxd2298xxx  in 0.1 m phosphate/citrate
buffer, stopped with 4 n h$o,, and read at 492 nm.

by

uroki-

nase. kinetic data were obtained by measuring the amidolytic activity
of plasmin using the chromogenic substrate s-2251 (kabi, stockholm,
sweden) (30). plasminogen was preincubated with and without  xxxg1342xxx 
at 37oc for 30 min in 50 mm hepes, ph 7.4. after cooling to room
temperature, the plasmin substrate s-2251 (0.45 mm) was added and
the reaction begun with the addition of a constant amount of human
urokinase (170 plough units) to a 500./.d reaction volume. doubling the
concentration of s-2251 had no significant effect on the reaction velocities, indicating that the system was saturated with respect to the plasmin
substrate. no hydrolysis of the substrate was observed with any single
component (~330, urokinase, or plasminogen) of the reaction mixture.
the increase in optical density (od) at 405 nm due to liberated pnitroaniline was measured after shaking every 15 s. the change in od,,,
between every 15-s time point was plotted vs time and the initial rates
of plasmin generation were calculated using linear regression analysis
of the straight line portions of the plots. at low concentrations of plasminogen without  xxxg1342xxx  present, a lag phase was observed whereas in
the presence of  xxxg1342xxx , the change in od between every time point was
linear for only the first few time points before the rate of plasmin generation began to decrease. the change in od/min in the straight line
portion of the curves was converted into rates of plasmin generation

added and the activation of plasminogen to plasmin was
measured spectrophot,ometrically
using the chromogenic
plasmin substrate s-2251. initial velocities of plasmin
generation were determined from straight line plots of
change in optical density at 405 nm per 15 s vs time.
rates of plasmin generation by urokinase were much
slower in the absence of  xxxg1342xxx  and at low concentrations
of plasminogen a lag phase was noted. the rate of plasmin
generation in the presence of  xxxg1342xxx  was quite high and
only
the first few readings at low concentrations of plasminogen gave a straight line when plotted as plasmin formation vs time before significant sloping of the line occurred, correlating to a decrease in plasmin generation.
the rate of plasmin formation was calculated from standard curves bbtained with known concentrations of plasmin with the s-2251 assay. a lineweaver-burk

of plasminogen

with urokinase was approximately 1.0 pm with op without
plasminogen prebound to  xxxg1342xxx . however, the binding of
plasminogen to gp33o significantly
increased the rate of
plasmin formation. table i shows the average k, and
v maxvalues obtained from an average of 5 different experiments. the increase in v,,, appears to have a direct
relationship with the  xxxg1342xxx  concentration.
it should be
noted that no binding of urokinase to  xxxg1342xxx  with or without plasminogen present was observed when analyzed by
elisa.
neither  xxxg1342xxx  nor bsa affected the kinetics of plasmin
using the s-2251 substrate (k, 0.12 mm); however,
at low
concentrations of plasmin (less than 50 pg/ml) both  xxxg1342xxx 
and bsa had an effect on plasmin stability at 37°c. after
30 min at 37”c, residual plasmin activity of a 15 pg/ml
solution without  xxxg1342xxx  present decreased to 63 + 3% of
that obtained in the presence of  xxxg1342xxx  (200 /*g/ml). activity of plasmin in the presence of bsa (200 pg/ml) was
approximately 84 -t 4% of the activity obtained with  xxxg1342xxx 
present, indicating that the total concentration of protein
is probably contributing to the increase in stability of the
diluted enzyme at 37°c. incubation of plasminogen at
low concentrations at 37°c for 30 min had no effect on
its subsequent activation to plasmin when compared to
plasminogen kept at 4°c. only active plasmin exhibited
this decreased stability at 37°c at dilute concentrations.

plasmin binding to  xxxg1342xxx . rat plasmin was obtained
by incubating purified rat plasminogen with immobilized
urokinase. the resulting plasmin was active toward its
chromogenic substrate s-2251 and the plasmin preparations were shown by sds-page western analysis using
a rabbit anti-plasminogen
antibody to be void of any detectable plasminogen. also, complete conversion of plasminogen to plasmin was confirmed since further incubation of the plasmin preparations with urokinase did
not result in an increase in plasmin activity.
plasmin binding to  xxxg1342xxx  was analyzed by elisa. initially, plasmin at high concentrations bound not only to
 xxxg1342xxx  but also to bsa control wells. this was presumably
due to plasmin cleavage of bsa and subsequent binding
of plasmin to the newly generated lysine residues via the
plasmin lysine binding sites. this binding of plasmin to
bsa could be inhibited by the preincubation of plasmin
with 50 pg/ml aprotinin, a tight binding inhibitor of plasmin. at this concentration of aprotinin, no plasmin activity could be observed in the presence of the chromogenic substrate s-2251 over several hours. the binding
of aprotinin to plasmin did not affect the binding of plasmin to  xxxg1342xxx  as measured by elisa. therefore, aprotinin-inhibited
plasmin was used during the analysis of
binding to  xxxg1342xxx .
plasmin bound to  xxxg1342xxx  in a time-dependent manner,
with maximum binding occurring after approximately 45

the “infinite dilution” technique with 300 ~1 of buffer per
well containing 20 mm  xxxd146xxx  to help prevent rebinding

 xxxg1342xxx  was shown to be specific for  xxxg1342xxx  and could be
inhibited with the addition of exogenous  xxxg1342xxx  (fig. 4).
no inhibition of plasmin binding to  xxxg1342xxx  was observed
with increasing concentrations of bsa. the binding of
plasmin to  xxxg1342xxx  was saturable as shown in fig. 5. an
apparent kd of approximately 200-250 nm was estimated
from the saturation curve. this value is identical to the
estimated kd for plasminogen binding to  xxxg1342xxx  (6). an
attempt was made to establish the kd by scatchard plot
analysis; however, as was the case with plasminogen, labeling of plasmin with ilz5 interfered with the subsequent
binding to  xxxg1342xxx . as stated previously, most reports of
plasminogen and plasmin binding to cells and proteins
indicate that primary binding is through the lysine binding
sites. the binding of plasmin to  xxxg1342xxx  in the presence of
the lysine analogue,  xxxd146xxx , and  xxxd302xxx , an inhibitor
which binds to the 5th kringle of plasmin and plasminogen, is also shown in fig. 5. both 20 mm  xxxd146xxx  and 50
mm  xxxd302xxx  inhibited some but not all of the binding
of plasmin to  xxxg1342xxx .
discussion

plasminogen is activated to plasmin in the extravascular space primarily by urokinase. plasmin is a broadspectrum  xxxg745xxx  found to play an important role
not only in fibrinolysis but also in cell migration, tissue
remodeling, and tumor invasion (32). specific receptors
for urokinase have been found on several cell types, including the glomerular epithelial cell (14). we have previously reported that a large glycoprotein also located on

two different experiments in which background binding to bsa-coated
wells has been subtracted.

the glomerular epithelial cell is capable of binding plasminogen (6). we now report that once plasminogen is
bound to  xxxg1342xxx , the subsequent activation rate of plasminogen to plasmin by urokinase is increased when compared to plasminogen activation in solution. plasmin appears to have the same affinity for  xxxg1342xxx  as plasminogen.
also, the plasmin bound to  xxxg1342xxx  is resistant to its natural
inhibitor, oc,-antiplasmin.
analysis of the kinetic data indicated that the rate of
plasmin formation by urokinase is increased when plasminogen is bound to  xxxg1342xxx , whereas the k,,, values do not
change. the calculated km value of 1.0 /*m for the conversion of rat plasminogen to plasmin by human urokinase

plasmin

binding

and

activation

of plasminogen

is near the value of 2.0 fm reported by wohl et al. (33)
for human plasminogen and urokinase. although other
reported k, values are higher than these, kinetic parameters of enzyme-catalyzed reactions are dependent upon
several factors, including ph, temperature, and, in the
case of plasminogen, a change in conformation
in the
presence of different ions (34). since rat urokinase is not
commercially available, we are not sure if the kinetic parameters would be different from those reported here using
human urokinase. however, the important fact reported
here is that although the k,,, values do not change when
plasminogen is bound to  xxxg1342xxx , the velocities of the rate
of plasmin formation do increase.
free plasmin is rapidly inactivated by the specific inhibitor, az-antiplasmin (31). the resulting 1:l complex is
very stable and essentially irreversible. however, when
plasmin is bound to lysine residues through its kringle 1
lysine binding site, the inhibition
by nz-antiplasmin
is
very slow and may occur only when plasmin dissociates
from the lysine residue. originally, this decrease in inhibition by cwz-antiplasmin on lysine bound plasmin was
believed to be due to the requirement of az-antiplasmin
to bind initially to plasmin’s lysine binding site before
binding to plasmin’s active site (35). however, it has been
suggested that when plasmin binds to a lysine residue,
there is an alteration in the conformation of plasmin and
it, is this altered conformation of plasmin which causes
the decreased ability of cy,-antiplasmin to inhibit plasmin
(36). when plasmin is bound to  xxxg1342xxx , it is protected
from inhibition by a,-antiplasmin.
whether this protection is due to a change in conformation of plasmin bound
to  xxxg1342xxx  or the unavailability
of the kringle 1 lysine binding site to bind uz-antiplasmin is not known.
the binding of plasminogen and plasmin to  xxxg1342xxx  differs from that found in other studies reporting the binding
of plasminogen to cells and other proteins in that the
presence of lysine analogues, such as  xxxd146xxx , does not
completely inhibit the subsequent binding of plasminogen
or plasmin to  xxxg1342xxx . there is some difference in the effect
of  xxxd146xxx  on the binding of plasminogen vs plasmin to
 xxxg1342xxx .  xxxd146xxx  (20 mm) shows only a slight inhibitory effect
on the binding of plasminogen to  xxxg1342xxx  (6), whereas
 xxxd146xxx  inhibited the binding of plasmin to  xxxg1342xxx  by approximately 50%. the reason for the increased ability of
 xxxd146xxx  to inhibit plasmin binding to  xxxg1342xxx  vs plasminogen
binding is unclear. however, there is a large conformational change when plasminogen is converted into plasmin
as well as the loss of a 76-amino-acid n-terminal peptide
which is thought to block the kringle 1 lysine binding site
(28). these changes may be the cause of the increased
susceptibility of plasmin vs plasminogen binding to  xxxg1342xxx 
by  xxxd146xxx .  xxxd302xxx , which is thought to bind to kringle 5 of plasminogen (37), inhibited the binding of both
plasminogen (6) and plasmin to  xxxg1342xxx  by approximately
the same amount. overall, these inhibition
studies indicate that the binding of plasminogen and plasmin to  xxxg1342xxx 

bound

is not simply through lysine residues, as may be the case
in several other systems, but may involve the binding of
 xxxg1342xxx  to several regions of plasminogen while still leaving
the cleavage site for urokinase accessible and the resulting
active site of plasmin free while still bound to  xxxg1342xxx . it
should be noted that during our elisa studies no binding
of urokinase to  xxxg1342xxx  with or without plasminogen present
could be detected.
in summary, the data presented indicate that the binding of plasminogen to  xxxg1342xxx  is an effective means of increasing the rate of plasmin production on the glomerular
and tubular epithelial cell surface. the inability of apantiplasmin to inhibit plasmin bound to  xxxg1342xxx  and the
similar affinity of  xxxg1342xxx  for both plasminogen and plasmin
indicate that once plasmin is formed, it can retain its
activity in this microenvironment
and cannot be inhibited
until released from  xxxg1342xxx . the exact function and reason
for an active  xxxg745xxx  to be bound to glomerular
and tubular epithelial cells remain in question. at present,
it is not known if plasmin plays a role in the morphological
changes observed in the glomerular basement membrane
during active heymann nephritis.
