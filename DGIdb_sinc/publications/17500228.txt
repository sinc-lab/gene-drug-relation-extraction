[characteristics of a-interferon-generated dendritic cells in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis].  the phenotype of the dendritic cells (dc) generated from the adhesion fraction of mononuclear cells in the presence of gm-csf and alpha-interferon was studied in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. despite the absence of significant differences in the count of mature  xxxg397xxx +dcs in the groups of patients (n = 38) and healthy donors (n = 30), elevated cd14(+)-monocyte levels and few activated cd25(+)-dcs were indicative of the impaired process of dc maturation/generation in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, particularly in a subgroup of patients with a low t-cell proliferative response against ppd (ppd-anergy, n = 10). the patients with tuberculosis showed the lower relative levels of  xxxg1208xxx (-)- xxxg1178xxx (+)-dc and the normal levels of myeloid  xxxg1208xxx (+) xxxd123xxx (-)dcs. however, in patients with ppd-anergy, the content of myeloid  xxxg1208xxx (+) xxxg1178xxx (-)-dcs was significantly higher than that in ppd-reactive patients. moreover, the patients with ppd-anergy were characterized by the elevated peripheral blood levels of cd14+cd16(+)-monocytes, which was associated with the high suppressive activity of monocytes (r(s) = 0.53; p < 0.05). the impaired process of dc generation/maturation in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis is believed to be associated with the changes in the phenotypic and functional properties of monocytes and to be a cause of an inadequate antigen-specific response in tuberculous infection.
