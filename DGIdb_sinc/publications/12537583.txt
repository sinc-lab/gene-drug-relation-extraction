abstract
background: biochemical markers for liver fibrosis (fibrotest) and necroinflammatory features
(actitest) are an alternative to liver biopsy in patients with chronic hepatitis c. our aim was to
assess the inter-laboratory variability of these tests, and their 6 components (gamma-glutamyl
transpeptidase,  xxxg941xxx ,  xxxg831xxx -macroglobulin, haptoglobin,  xxxg173xxx , and
total bilirubin) and to identify factors associated with this variability.
results: serum of 24 patients with chronic hepatitis c or severe alcoholic liver disease were
prospectively recorded and analyzed in one reference center and in 8 additional laboratories.
when gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and  xxxg941xxx  were expressed in international
units, there was no significant difference between laboratories in the results of fibrotest or
actitest; kappa statistics were greater than 0.50 with only 0.8% of cases (3/384) with a discordance
of more than one stage. the main factor significantly associated with variability was the expression
of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and  xxxg941xxx , as multiples of upper limit of reference
values. the use of standardized method with  xxxd3047xxx  reduced the variability of alanine
aminotransferase expression, and standardized original szasz method reduced the variability of gammaglutamyl transpeptidase expression.

conclusions: the variability of fibrotest and actitest was acceptable without clinical
consequences for the prediction of the stage of liver fibrosis and grade of activity. standardized
methods and assay calibration should be used and expression of  xxxg941xxx  and gammaglutamyl transpeptidase in multiples of the upper limit of reference values should not be employed.

background
the "gold standard" for assessing fibrosis, liver biopsy, is
recommended prior to the initiation of antiviral therapy
[1]; in addition, it is vital for monitoring fibrosis progression. unfortunately, this procedure is invasive, prone to
complications, including hemorrhage and death [2], and
has a high risk of sampling error [3]. biochemical markers
for liver fibrosis (fibrotest) and necroinflammatory features (actitest) are an alternative to liver biopsy, in patients with chronic hepatitis c [4]. since the first
publication, which included a validation period [4], those
tests have been validated in different populations by the
same reference laboratory [5,6] and by an independent
group [7]. the tests combine five components ( xxxg831xxx -macroglobulin, haptoglobin,  xxxg173xxx , gamma-glutamyl
transpeptidase (ggt), and total bilirubin) for fibrotest
and same plus  xxxg941xxx  (alt) for actitest.
the aim of this study was to assess the inter-laboratory
variability of fibrotest and actitest, including their six serum liver components, in patients with chronic liver disease, and to identify factors associated with that
variability. our concern was to assess whether the analytical methods adapted on the different analyzers were associated with significant variability in fibrotest and/or
actitest values. moreover, we aimed to compare the variability of fibrotest and actitest in relation to the method
of expressing enzymatic activity; in particular, in terms of
absolute values or as multiples of the upper limit of normal. since we and others have demonstrated that current
definitions of normal values may be inappropriate [8–
10], a major concern was the definition of alt and ggt
activity. in routine practice, the definition of the upper
limit of normal (uln) of alt and ggt varies between
laboratories, but is rarely detailed. because numerous
medical guidelines make reference to alt and ggt expressed as multiples of the uln (uln units), variations in
the definition of normal may have important practical
consequences.

results
the main characteristics of the included patients are outlined in table 1. according to each patient and laboratory,
details of the fibrotest and actitest assays are given in figure 1. there was no significant difference between centers
for fibrotest using ggt expressed in international units
[mean (sd) = 0.57 (0.26), range = 0.48–0.65, f-ratio =

0.27, p = 0.27]. for fibrotest using ggt expressed in uln
units [mean (sd) = 0.55 (0.27), range = 0.45–0.68, f-ratio
= 1.26, p = 0.27], there was a significant difference between three centers (center 5 had higher means values
than center 2 and 4; p = 0.02 for both comparisons).
there was no significant difference between centers for actitest using alt and ggt expressed in international units
[mean (sd) = 0.32 (0.26), range = 0.38–0.53, f-ratio =
1.21, p = 0.30] and for actitest using alt and ggt expressed in uln units [mean (sd) = 0.44 (0.27), range =
0.27–0.43, f-ratio = 0.81, p = 0.59).
the details of the liver proteins and total bilirubin assays
according to each patient and laboratory are outlined in
figure 2. there were no significant differences according
to testing center for any of these assays (between centers
or versus the reference center): ( xxxg831xxx -macroglobulin [mean
(sd) = 2.89 (1.16) g/l, range = 2.69–3.33, f-ratio = 0.72,
p = 0.67], haptoglobin [mean (sd) = 0.98 (0.58) g/l, range
= 0.92–1.03, f-ratio = 0.07, p = 0.99),  xxxg173xxx 
[mean (sd) = 1.30 (0.51) g/l, range = 1.16–1.42, f-ratio =
1.21, p = 0.30] and bilirubin [mean (sd) = 28.8 (66) micromol/l, range = 15.8–51.1, f-ratio = 0.51, p = 0.85]. one
analyzer (advia) gave lower mean apoliprotein a1 levels
[1.06 (0.43) g/l) than the other analyzers [1.33 (0.52) g/l;
p = 0.02].
the details of the alt and ggt assays, according to each
patient and laboratory and expressed in international or
uln units, are given in figure 3. there was no significant
difference between centers for alt expressed in international units [mean (sd) = 70 (47) iu/ml, range = 57–86,
f-ratio = 1.30, p = 0.25]. however, when the assays used
 xxxd3047xxx  as in the reference center, the mean
alt was higher [78 (50) iu/ml] than assays not using  xxxd3047xxx  [60 (42) iu/ml; p = 0.003]. for alt expressed in uln units [mean (sd) = 48 (37), range = 37–
71, f-ratio = 1.65, p = 0.12], there was a significant difference between center 1 and all centers (p = 0.009 vs center
2, p = 0.008 vs center 3, p = 0.04 vs center 4, p = 0.04 vs
center 5, p = 0.02 vs center 6, p = 0.03 vs center 7, p = 0.01
vs center 10 and p = 0.001 vs center 11). there were no significant differences between centers for ggt expressed in
international units [mean (sd) = 130 (158) iu/ml, range
= 57–86, f-ratio = 1.30, p = 0.25] or in uln units [mean
(sd) = 109 (121) iu/ml, range = 78–154, f-ratio = 1.46,
p = 0.17]. however, and despite the use of the same szasz

method, one automate (dade behring rxl) gave higher
ggt mean values [165 (200) iu/ml] than the others [120
(143) iu/ml; p = 0.06].
passing-bablok linear regression analyses [13] of all samples between laboratories and the reference center are
summarized in table 2. the intercept and slope between
the reference center and other laboratories were excellent
for the three proteins with only one decrease for  xxxg173xxx  in a single center using the advia analyzer.
for total bilirubin, there was only one center with a higher
slope. for the enzymes, there was more variability. for
alt, mean values were lower in centers not using  xxxd3047xxx . for ggt, centers using the rxl analyzer
had a higher slope (greater than 1).

concordance rates (kappa statistics) among laboratories
are given in table 3; all were statistically significant. when
ggt and alt were expressed in international units, fibrotest and actitest kappa statistics were all greater than 0.50
with only 0.8% cases (3 out of the 384 comparisons) with
a discordance of more than one fibrosis stage. there was
no discordance greater than one grade for actitest. in contrast, when ggt and alt were expressed in uln units, fibrotest and actitest kappa statistics were lower than 0.50
in 11 comparisons (out of the 16 comparisons versus the
reference laboratory) with 5% of cases (21 out of the 384
comparisons) with a discordance of more than one fibrosis stage or greater than one activity grade.

discussion
this study showed that the variability of fibrotest and actitest values, among nine different laboratories, was acceptable and without clinical consequences for the
prediction of the stage of liver fibrosis or grade of activity.
this finding is important since it confirms that those tests
can be routinely computed from the results of the six individual components obtained by non-centralized measurements. online assessment is available using the
website http://www.biopredictive.com. to guarantee the
quality of this assessment, it was necessary to identify the
factors associated with the variability of the six components.
this study confirms that the expression of alt and ggt
in multiples of the upper limit of reference values should
be avoided. despite efforts to standardize enzymatic assay
methods, homogeneity of alt results has not been
achieved as attested by external quality controls [11], and
identical limits of reference values cannot be defined.
many clinicians believe that expression of the results as
multiples of the upper limits of reference ranges can reduce inter-laboratory variability. our study confirms previously observed results [10], that this method of
expression is, in fact, worse than that using international
units both for alt and ggt. in our reference center, the
reference limit recorded was similar to the described mean

value from a recent study [9] and lower than in the other
laboratories. if actitest was expressed in a standardized
way, using the upper limit of each laboratory for ggt and
alt, this induced lower concordance rate than actitest using international units.
to increase inter-laboratory coherence in the results of enzymatic activities, standardized assays against a reference
method should be employed, with calibration of the assay
using a commutable enzymatic material [14]. the values
of this calibrator must be assigned by a reference method.
for proteins and bilirubin assays, there was an excellent
homogeneity. this was anticipated for  xxxg831xxx -macroglobulin
since the same analyzer was used in all laboratories. although the use of three different analyzers, haptoglobin
has the best homogeneity. in fact, the assays of these two
proteins are standardized against the crm 470 reference
material. this reference product is now used in different
measurement procedures to attain results numerically the
same, whatever the clinical conditions. for  xxxg173xxx , only one analyzer was slightly different from the
others. this is due to the use of a different reference material to standardize the assay. overall, the data from the
laboratories were linearly related with the reference center
with a slope close to 1 and a non-significant analytical imprecision; there were few pairs of assays outside the confidence limits and the samples were adequately distributed

se – standard error

over the investigated range. as previously observed, when
ordinary linear regression (in combination with correlation analysis in the passing bablock method) gave poor
estimates, in particular for ggt and alt assays, we found
several analytical reasons for the poor performance. enzymatic measurement with the szasz method (standardized
against the original for ggt), and with the standardized
method according to the international federation of clinical chemistry (using  xxxd3047xxx  for alt),
would probably reduce the variability.
because of their predictive values and their reproducibility
in different populations, biochemical markers could be
used as surrogate markers for liver biopsy both for the initial decision of liver biopsy and for the follow-up of
chronic hepatitis c patients. to date, liver biopsy has been
considered mandatory for the management of patients infected by hepatitis c virus (hcv) [1]. for some patients
and general practitioners, it may be considered an aggressive procedure [2]. reviews of morbidity and mortality of
intercostal liver biopsy observed a mean occurrence of
pain in 30 % of patients, 3 out of 1,000 endured severe adverse events, and 3 out of 10,000 died [2].

there is no ideal gold standard for the assessment of liver
histology. even liver biopsy is dependant on the inter- and
intra-observer (pathologist) differences. there are also potential problems with liver biopsy sampling variation. in
a study with three consecutive samples through a single
entry site, only 50 % of patients with cirrhosis were scored
as cirrhosis on the three samples [3]. it is therefore possible that biochemical markers such as those described may
provide a more accurate (quantitative and reproducible)
picture of fibrogenic events occurring within the liver. furthermore, and because treatment is now so effective in patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection, the utility of biopsy
in this setting could be challenged [15].

conclusions
when ggt and alt are expressed in international units,
fibrotest and actitest can be computed from different
laboratories with acceptable variability. to increase interlaboratory coherency, standardized methods and enzymatic calibration should be used particularly for ggt and
alt assays. expression of alt and ggt in multiples of the
upper limit of reference values should be avoided.

authors' contribution

the serum of 24 informed patients (21 with chronic hepatitis c and 3 with decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis)
were prospectively collected in the department of hepato-gastroenterology of the pitié-salpêtrière hospital, in
paris, france. the main characteristics of the included patients are outlined in table 1. sera were separated in the
above reference laboratory, conserved at + 4°c and distributed to ten different laboratories, in france, within 24
hours. for two laboratories, serum was missing for at least
one patient; therefore, these laboratories have been excluded from the core analysis. sensitivity analyses including these two excluded laboratories did not change the
results or conclusions (data not shown).

ph, fib, rpm and tp elaborated the protocol and wrote
the manuscript. ph, fib, dm, ga, db, pcl, gd, dd, tk,
ms, dt and et performed the assays. tp performed the
statistical analysis.

characteristics of the analyzer, reagents and analytical
methods employed used in the nine included laboratories
are detailed in table 4. eleven different analyzers were
used. for the measurement of alt activity, five laboratories used a standardized method according to the ifcc,
with  xxxd3047xxx , and four without pyridoxal
phosphate. for the measurement of ggt activity, the nine
laboratories used the szasz method; including in four a
recommended method of standardization [11].
haptoglobin and  xxxg173xxx  were assayed by immunoturbidimetric or immunonephelemetric methods.
 xxxg831xxx -macroglobulin was assayed by immunonephelemetry.
analytical measurements of  xxxg831xxx -macroglobulin and haptoglobin were standardized against the certified international reference material 470 (crm 470). apolipoprotein
a1 assays adapted on the different analyzers were standardized against the reference material of world health organization-international federation of clinical chemistry
sp1-01 (who-ifcc sp1-01), except on the advia-bayeranalyzer (advia). total bilirubin was assayed by diazoreactions methods.
statistical analysis used multiple measure variance analyses and passing-bablok linear regression analyses for the
comparison of inter-laboratory results, and kappa statistics for the predicted histological features. multiple comparisons used bonferroni (versus control) and tukeykramer multiple-comparison tests. number cruncher statistical systems software was used [12]. the linear relationship between laboratories and reference center were
assessed with confidence limits for the slope and the intercept and the number of pairs out of bounds; they were
used to determine whether there was only a chance difference between the slope and 1 and between the intercept
and 0 [13]. means were expressed with standard deviation
(sd), except for kappa statistics.
