topical  xxxd3259xxx  therapy in diabetic senile cataracts: cataract-iv.   xxxd3259xxx , a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug has been found to be a potent inhibitor of enzyme  xxxg111xxx . we used  xxxd3259xxx  topically in diabetic senile cataract patients to note if it effects the progression of cataracts. more of  xxxd3259xxx  treated eyes maintained initial vision and fewer eyes had visual loss of up to two lines or more as compared to control eyes. the extent and density of different opacities showed less progression in  xxxd3259xxx  treated eyes but it was not statistically significant except that the ophthalmoscopically observed density of opacity showed statistically very significant lesser mean increase in  xxxd3259xxx  treated eyes. we suggest that  xxxd3259xxx  is a potential drug which should be further evaluated in large double blind photodocumented studies in diabetic senile cataracts.
