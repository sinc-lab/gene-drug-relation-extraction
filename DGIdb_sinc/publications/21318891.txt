abstract
polyamines, small positively charged molecules, are vital for cell proliferation and differentiation. they
are found ubiquitously in eukaryotic cells. additionally, they interact with a wide range of other molecules and some membrane associated receptors. polyamines, spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx , are synthesized by
two aminopropyltransferases, spermidine synthase and  xxxg2181xxx . recently, mutations in the latter
enzyme have been shown to be responsible for an x-linked intellectual disability condition known as
snyder–robinson syndrome.  xxxg2181xxx  deficiency is thus far the only known polyamine deficiency
syndrome in humans.

1. introduction
polyamines are ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells and their presence is
critical for cell growth and differentiation (1, 2). polyamines are
rather simple small molecules that interact with a variety of molecules
ranging from nucleic acids to proteins. as a result, they are involved
in numerous cellular processes: transcription, translation, and modulation of ion channel activities (3–5).
the polyamines, spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx , are synthesized by
two aminopropyltransferases (6). spermidine synthase converts
putrescine to spermidine and  xxxg2181xxx  (sms) converts
spermidine to  xxxd3234xxx . the aminopropyl group, in both reactions,
comes from decarboxylated s- xxxd3156xxx  (dcadomet) and
its transfer forms 5¢- xxxd2619xxx  (mta) as a by-product.

recently, mutations in hsms have been found to be associated
with an x-linked mental retardation (mr) condition, snyder–
robinson syndrome (srs) (7–9). sms deficiency is the first
known polyamine deficiency in humans. affected males have mr,
hypotonia, cerebellar circuitry dysfunction, thin habitus, and
kyphoscoliosis. biochemically, the patients have almost no sms
activity, low levels of intracellular  xxxd3234xxx , and elevated spermidine/
 xxxd3234xxx  levels. this phenotype clearly establishes a critical role
of  xxxd3234xxx  in cognitive and cerebellar function.
srs was one of the earliest reported x-linked mental retardation
(xlmr) conditions (10). it was initially described as a nonsyndromic
xlmr entity meaning the affected males were not thought to have
any physical features distinguishing them from their normal brothers
(omim 309583). however, they were hypotonic and had an
unsteady gait in addition to mr. a follow-up analysis of the family in
1996 (11) identified additional clinical findings which included facial
asymmetry, narrow or cleft palate, nasal dysarthric speech, diminished
muscle mass, kyphoscoliosis, and long great toes. some of the males
were also noted to have experienced seizures.
along with the clinical delineation of srs in 1996, arena
et al. (11) were able to map the syndrome to xp21.3-p22.12. this
allowed positional mapping and candidate gene screening to occur.
as a result, cason et al. (7) were able to show that a nucleotide
alteration, c.329+5 g>a, in the  xxxg2181xxx  (hsms) gene
segregated in the srs family. this g→a substitution caused aberrant splicing of hsms which resulted in the absence of exon 4 and
truncation of the protein (7).
subsequent to the identification of the link between srs and
hsms, three additional families were identified (8, 9) (boyd and
schwartz, unpublished data). this has allowed for a further refinement of the clinical phenotype characteristics of srs, summarized
in table 1. thus, srs should be suspected in any male with
mild–moderate mr, thin habitus, muscle hypoplasia, kyphoscoliosis, some facial asymmetry, a prominent lower lip, and long
great toes.
males with srs have almost no measurable sms activity as
measured in their lymphocytes or fibroblasts in culture as summarized in table 2. the males from the original srs do have measurable sms activity (2–10% control) most likely due to the fact
that their mutation affects splicing of the hsms gene resulting in
the presence of a low level of normal transcript and thus normal
­protein (7). the other known srs families have deleterious mutations present in all the transcripts, thus adversely affecting the
function of all sms protein synthesized (8, 9)(boyd and schwartz,
unpublished data). coincidental with the lack of or low levels of
sms activity, males with srs have decreased levels of cellular
­ xxxd3234xxx  and significantly elevated levels of cellular spermidine
(table 2). as a result, the spermidine/ xxxd3234xxx  (spd/spm) ratio
is two- to fivefold higher as compared to controls. genetic and

biochemical confirmation of srs requires analysis of the hsms
gene and measurement of sms activity and polyamine content in
cells derived from patients. the assay described below is a very
sensitive method to assay sms. it is modified from that described
in previous publications (12, 13) and measures the formation of
[35s]mta from [35s]dcadomet. measurement of cellular
polyamines can be made using a variety of methods including preand postcolumn derivatization with separation by hplc (14, 15)
and by analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (16,
17).

(table 3). the c.329+5 g>a mutation, by virtue of it causing
alternative splicing (removing exon 4) and subsequent truncation
of the sms protein, removes the active site. the p.g56s mutation occurs in the amino terminal end of sms, which is critical for
dimer formation (19). as sms functions as a dimer, the result is
loss of activity and protein instability. the two other mutations,
p.v132g and p.i150t alter the three dimensional structure of
the protein reducing dimer formation, decreasing stability and
virtually eliminating enzymatic activity.
1. mutation screening of the sms gene can be conducted on
genomic dna. presently primers are designed flanking each
of the 11 exons that contain the coding sequence for sms.
the amplicons extend at least 50 bp into intronic sequence
on either side of each exon. utilization of m13 tails allows for
efficient amplifications of all 11 exons for sequencing under
the same pcr conditions (8, 9).
3.2.  xxxd3234xxx 
synthase assay

1. pellets of fibroblast or lymphoblast cells are homogenized in
buffer a.
2. the homogenate is centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 rpm (30,000 × g)
for 20 min at 4°c.
3. the supernatant extract is removed and stored frozen at −70°c
until needed.
4. the protein concentration in the supernatant extract is
determined.
5. assay tubes are set up containing 0.1 ml assay solution consisting of 40 ml 0.5 m na phosphate buffer ph 7.5, 4 ml
1 mm adodato, 10 ml 10 mm spermidine and 6 ml [35s]
dcadomet and 40 ml water giving final concentrations of
0.1 m na phosphate buffer, 20 mm adodato, 1.0 mm
 xxxd3234xxx , and 80,000–100,000 dpm of [35s]dcadomet (see
note 6).
6. add to each assay tube 0.1 ml of supernatant extract from cell
culture (see note 7). blank assays are also set up using buffer a.
7. cover tubes and incubate at 37°c for 1 h.

442

schwartz et al.

8. place the tubes and add 1 ml of 25 mm hcl to stop the
reaction.
9. minicolumns of cellex p or equivalent resin (see notes 5 and 8)
are washed with two aliquots of 2 ml 0.5 n hcl, then once
with 2 ml of distil water and equilibrated by passage of three
aliquots of 2 ml of 25 mm hcl. the columns are then placed
over scintillation vials.
10. each assay sample is transferred to its corresponding column.
after the sample flows though the column into the scintillation vial, 2 ml of 25 mm hcl is added to each column and
allowed to drain into same vial (see note 9).
11. the vials are taken and add 15 ml bcs counting scintillant.
after capping and vigorous mixing, the radioactivity is determined in a scintillation counter.
12. the radioactivity present in the sample minus that present in
the blank represents the sms activity. results are expressed as
dpm [35s]mta formed per microgram of protein added (see
note 7). samples from srs patients have <10% of the activity
present in control samples.
13. the columns can be reused. clean using two aliquots of 2 ml
0.5 n hcl, then two aliquots of 2 ml of distil water and
three aliquots of 2 ml of 25 mm hcl. discard effluent in
radioactive waste. store them in the refrigerator in a covered
container so they do not dry out.
3.3. polyamine assay

1. the cellular  xxxd3234xxx  concentration and spermidine: xxxd3234xxx 
ratio can readily be assayed by a variety of methods. older methods
based on hplc separation of either dansyl derivatives (14) or
the polyamines themselves with detection postcolumn by reaction with o-phthalaldehyde (15) and more recent methods using
gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, which are described
in this volume (16, 17) are suitable for this purpose.

4. notes
1. if crude cell extracts, which contain significant amounts of
putrescine are used, the assay does not distinguish between
spermidine synthase and sms activity. rather than dialyze the
extracts to remove putrescine, we add adodato which is a
potent and specific mechanism-based spermidine synthase
inhibitor (18). this is not commercially available but its synthesis
is published (18, 20).
2. other spermidine synthase inhibitors such as trans-4-­
methylcyclohexylamine should also work for this purpose
(21, 22).

3. this is not now commercially available but procedures for its
synthesis are described in references (13, 23).
4. the advantage of using [35s]-dcadomet is that [35s]methionine needed for its synthesis is relatively inexpensive and is available at a very high specific activity. the disadvantage is that
synthesis requires the use of two enzymes, s- xxxd3156xxx 
( xxxd3156xxx ) synthetase and  xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylase. the requirement for the former can be eliminated by using [3h-methyl ]
 xxxd3156xxx  or [14c-methyl] xxxd3156xxx  which are commercially
available but these are much more expensive and, particularly
in the case of the latter, have a much lower specific activity
lowering the sensitivity of the assay.
5. we use cellex p from biorad. the material is stable for several
years at room temperature, as is the suspended slurry when
stored in 25 mm hcl at 4°c. the minicolumns are made by
plugging a pasteur pipette with glass wool and then by adding
about 1 ml of a cation exchange resin. any weak cation
exchange resin can be used although it may be necessary to
modify the acid concentrations to ensure that dcadomet is
fully retained and that all mta formed is present in the first
flow-through and wash used for scintillation counting.
6. in order to maximize sensitivity we do not add unlabeled
dcadomet for assays in which samples from different sources
are being compared within the same assay. if an accurate
quantification of sms activity as pmol product per mg protein formed per hour is required then unlabeled dcadomet is
added at a final concentration of 2 mm. this is sufficient to
give a near maximal rate of reaction. the amount of [35s]
dcadomet may need to be increased to obtain enough radioactive product for accurate measurement but the amount of
the labeled material is negligible compared to the unlabeled
and no adjustment to the overall concentration is needed.
7. the amount of cell extract needs to be determined by preliminary testing to obtain a production of [35s]mta that is less than
15% of the input of [35s]dcadomet substrate and sufficient to
give at least twice the background obtained when no extract is
added to ensure accurate measurement. it is important to also
ensure that the reaction is proportional to the amount of
protein added by using at least two concentrations of extract
giving results within this range.
8. since these columns will drain at different rates, it is a good
idea to treat many more columns that are necessary and then
pick out the ones they are draining the fastest for use. we use
a piece of plexiglas with holes drilled in it to hold the columns.
while we preparing the columns, the plexiglas can be placed
over a waster container, and then before the samples added,
the plexiglas and columns can be situated over empty scintillation

444

schwartz et al.

vials. for this step, we place the vials in one of the cardboard
containers they were shipped in and then place the plexiglas
with the columns on top.
9. the principle of the separation is that the weakly charged
[35s]mta product passes through the column, whereas the
remaining [35s]dcadomet substrate, which is strongly positively charged, is retained. assay of the flow-through by scintillation counting indicates the amount of [35s]mta product
formed. mta is rapidly degraded in mammalian cells by mta
phosphorylase, which converts it to adenine and methylthioribose1-phosphate (24, 25). this does not affect this assay since the
[35s]methylthioribose-1-phosphate has no charge and is not
retained on the columns.
