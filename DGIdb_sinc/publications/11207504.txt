summary

1  xxxd3302xxx  ( xxxd3302xxx ), an  xxxd2951xxx  indole
derivative of serotonin, is a selective partial agonist
highly selective for  xxxg1117xxx  receptor with an af®nity
constant in the nanomolar range.  xxxd3302xxx  does not
cause adverse pharmacodynamic effects, is absorbed
rapidly after oral administration and distributes widely
into tissues. pharmacokinetics of oral  xxxd3302xxx 
are linear in the 2±12 mg dose range. after oral
administration  xxxd3302xxx  is metabolized mainly presystemically; when absorbed, intact  xxxd3302xxx  is excreted
as n-glucuronides mainly via the bile. no clinically
relevant drug±drug interactions were identi®ed.
 xxxd3302xxx  has proven safe in toxicity studies.
in pharmacodynamic studies,  xxxd3302xxx  stimulated the
peristaltic re¯ex in vitro, increased canine intestinal and

current irritable bowel
syndrome therapy

irritable bowel syndrome is an exceedingly common
condition in all societies; it is characterized by abdominal discomfort or pain in association with altered bowel
habit or incomplete stool evacuation. the estimated
prevalence in the community is about 10%, and the
incidence is 1±2% per annum.1, 2 irritable bowel
syndrome and its variants, collectively called functional
gastrointestinal disorders, constitute 40±50% of all the
patients seen by gastroenterologists in western countries.3 it has been estimated that about 10% of patients

three large phase iii randomized, double-blinded, and
placebo-controlled trials were performed predominantly
in females (» 85%) with constipation-predominant
irritable bowel syndrome. overall, phase iii results
support ef®cacy as assessed by the subject's global
assessment of relief with signi®cant improvement in
secondary endpoints such as abdominal pain, bowel

transient diarrhoea.

seen in general practice also have complaints consistent
with irritable bowel syndrome. this is a heterogeneous
disorder; the three most important mechanisms are
hypersensitivity of the gut, altered motility, and psychosocial disorder.4 gastrointestinal infection may serve
as a triggering or antecedent factor.5
the current therapy for irritable bowel syndrome
focuses on the major symptom experienced by the
patient.4, 6 in general, patients may present with either
diarrhoea, constipation, or a combination of pain, gas,
and bloating. however, patients' symptoms are not
constant over time; apart from temporal ¯uctuation, the
bowel complaint and predominance of speci®c symptoms may vary over time. thus, patients may present
with diarrhoea on one occasion, and constipation on
another. the mainstays of pharmacotherapy at present
are loperamide for diarrhoea, ®bre and an osmotic

laxative (such as magnesium salts or lactulose) for
constipation, and anticholinergic or calcium channel
blocker and muscle relaxants for pain, gas, and
bloating. a systematic review of pharmacological
treatment of irritable bowel syndrome suggests that
smooth muscle relaxants are bene®cial for abdominal
pain, although only one of seven trials accepted for the
analysis involved more than 100 patients; the remainder were small studies.7 recently, alosetron was
approved for the treatment of female patients with
diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
among patients with a signi®cant psychological or
psychiatric component of the irritable bowel syndrome,
low dose antidepressants have also been effective in
relief of pain, depression, and diarrhoea.4, 8
current medical therapies for constipation-predominant
irritable bowel syndrome have been insuf®ciently
effective, and there is a need for novel approaches to
treatment. some of the de®ciencies with current
therapies are: ®rst, ®bre intake, particularly if it is
over 20 g per day, often results in aggravation of gas
and bloating; second, tricyclic antidepressants, which
are effective for pain and diarrhoea, tend to make
constipation in irritable bowel syndrome worse;8 and
third, laxatives may relieve the constipation but have
never been demonstrated to ameliorate the abdominal
pain component of the syndrome. the results of
controlled trials with selective serotonin re-uptake
inhibitors for irritable bowel syndrome are still awaited;
the hypothesis is that the serotonin selective
re-uptake inhibitors result in improved pain relief and
the known side-effect of diarrhoea may present a
potential advantage for patients whose predominant
bowel complaint is constipation. thus, a medication
that results in improvement in the relief of pain and
discomfort from the irritable bowel syndrome associated
with predominant constipation, while at the same
time improving bowel function, is not generally
available. this sometimes leads physicians to prescribe
analgesics, including those of the opioid variety, with
their consequent impact on drug dependence, aggravation of constipation, and sometimes worsening of the
quality of life.
in recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in
the development of compounds for the treatment of
irritable bowel syndrome. candidate compounds which
are in late development include the following:  xxxd1858xxx  (a cholecystokinin antagonist);  xxxd1692xxx  (a
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonist with in vitro properties that are

quite similar to those of the recently approved alosetron);
 xxxd3302xxx  (a selective  xxxg1117xxx  receptor partial agonist);
 xxxd3039xxx  (a  xxxg1117xxx  agonist which, like  xxxd3302xxx ,
is intended primarily for the relief of constipationpredominant irritable bowel syndrome); fedotozine (a
kappa opioid peripheral agonist which, in experimental
animals, relieves visceral pain without central sideeffects); and neurokinin receptor subtype antagonists.
in this review, the goal is to summarize the basic
science, mechanism of action, ef®cacy and safety pro®le
of a novel  xxxg1117xxx  partial agonist,  xxxd3302xxx .
general properties of  xxxd3302xxx 

 xxxd3302xxx  ( xxxd3302xxx ) is a selective partial agonist at the
serotonin type-4 receptors ( xxxg1117xxx  receptors), which
mediate physiological functions in the gastrointestinal
tract.  xxxg1117xxx  receptors are located on intrinsic primary
afferent neurones, cholinergic interneurones that activate excitatory and inhibitory neurones involved in the
peristaltic re¯ex, and conceivably extrinsic visceral
afferents.  xxxg1117xxx  agonists have been used for the
treatment of motility disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract including gastro-oesophageal re¯ux disease,
gastroparesis and chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction.
however, the available  xxxg1117xxx  agonists have been
generally ineffective in the treatment of lower bowel
motility disorders such as constipation-predominant
irritable bowel syndrome and constipation.9±11
 xxxg1117xxx  receptors belong to the family of seven transmembrane domain receptors coupled to g-protein
translation;12 they are responsible for eliciting the
depolarizing action of serotonin, which results in the
release of neurotransmitter, such as acetylcholine, from
enteric neurones.  xxxg1117xxx  receptors are located in the
central nervous system where they modulate dopamine
release and have a direct role in cognition and memory.
in the heart, these receptors are located in the atria, not
the ventricles, and have a chronotropic effect. in the
adrenal cortex, activation of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors transiently
stimulates aldosterone secretion;13 in the urinary
bladder, activation of the receptors increases detrusor
tone.14, 15
in vitro studies on intestinal tissues, and in vivo animal
and human studies of motor and sensory functions
(discussed below) provide the scienti®c rationale to
suggest that medications activating  xxxg1117xxx  receptors
should provide relief of pain and discomfort and
constipation in irritable bowel syndrome.

review:  xxxd3302xxx 

chemistry

the chemical name of  xxxd3302xxx  is 3-(5-methoxy-1hindol-3ylmethylene)-n-pentyl-carbazimidamide.  xxxd3302xxx  is an  xxxd2951xxx -indole derivative structurally
similar to serotonin; its molecular structure is shown in
figure 1.
partial agonistic activity of  xxxd3302xxx 

 xxxd3302xxx  is a partial agonist at the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor.
compared to serotonin, a full agonist with 100%
intrinsic activity,  xxxd3302xxx  possesses 21% intrinsic
activity in the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum.16
as a partial agonist at the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor,  xxxd3302xxx  is
less likely to induce receptor desensitization, compared to
full agonists; it is also likely to produce a normalizing
effect, augmenting the insuf®cient endogenous stimulation, and preventing the exaggerated affects associated
with full agonists. thus, it is expected that as a partial
agonist,  xxxd3302xxx  should provide a balanced modulation of the  xxxg1117xxx  receptors.17 the lower likelihood to
desensitize the  xxxg1117xxx  receptors is particularly relevant
since this class of  xxxg89xxx , which
possesses seven transmembrane domains, is particularly
prone to desensitization leading to tachyphylaxis or
tolerance.12
animal pharmacokinetics and
in vitro human studies

the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion
of  xxxd3302xxx  have been investigated in several species
(rat, mouse, rabbit and dog) in both pregnant and nonpregnant animals.18, 19 the metabolic pro®le of the rat
is representative of that in humans. in the rat, no major
accumulation of  xxxd3302xxx  or its metabolites in organs

was observed.  xxxd3302xxx  showed the potential to inhibit
cytochrome p 450 1 a2 and 2d6 in human liver
microsomes in vitro (ki approximately 1 lm). however,
no signi®cant drug-to-drug interactions were observed
in clinical studies with the prototype substrates theophylline (cyp1 a2) and dextromethorphan (cyp2d6) (see
below). in vitro, the major human metabolite (a
glucuronide) did not show relevant inhibition of any
of these isoenzymes. toxicology studies in animals
showed no relevant effects on reproductive or hormonal
functions, or embryofoetal or neonatal development.
although  xxxd3302xxx  was detected at low levels in
foetuses, radiotracer studies show that radioactivity
was about three times higher in milk than in plasma,
suggesting that a suckling infant might ingest a
signi®cant dose of  xxxd3302xxx .  xxxd3302xxx  had no mutagenic or clastogenic potential and did not induce any
dna damage.18
pharmacokinetic studies in humans 2 0 ± 2 2

 xxxd3302xxx  is rapidly absorbed following oral administration, with peak plasma concentration after approximately 1 h.  xxxd3302xxx  is hydrolysed by approximately
20% in the stomach (acidic ph under fasted conditions)
and absolute bioavailability is about 10%. concomitant
administration with food reduces systemic exposure by
40±65%. it is recommended that  xxxd3302xxx  be administered before the morning and evening meals; this was
the mode of administration in the phase iii clinical
trials.  xxxd3302xxx  is approximately 98% bound to plasma
proteins, primarily to a1-acid glycoprotein. the volume
of distribution at steady state is 368  223 l. after oral
administration,  xxxd3302xxx  undergoes acid hydrolysis in
the stomach (pre-systemic metabolism), subsequent
oxidation and glucuronidation. the main metabolite is
a glucuronide which has negligible af®nity for the
 xxxg1117xxx  receptors and has no effects on gastrointestinal
motor activity in the dog. systemically available
 xxxd3302xxx  is excreted as n-glucuronides mainly via the
bile. the estimated terminal half-life is 11  5 h. blood
clearance is approximately 48 l/h after intravenous
administration, which represents approximately 50% of
hepatic blood ¯ow. two-thirds of an orally administered
radiolabelled dose is excreted unchanged in faeces, and
the remainder is excreted in urine as metabolites.
the pharmacokinetics of oral doses of  xxxd3302xxx  (b.d.
for 5 days) are linear in the 2±12 mg dose range,
and are comparable in patients with irritable bowel

280

 xxxd3302xxx  also inhibits visceral afferents involved in
pain sensation (discussed below under in vivo actions).
the actions of  xxxd3302xxx  on the peristaltic re¯ex and
propulsion have been thoroughly evaluated by grider
et al.26, 27 endogenous serotonin is released from the
enterochromaf®n cells in the epithelial layer of the
mucosa in response to chemical or mechanical stimuli;
luminal application of  xxxd3302xxx  activates the  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors on intrinsic primary afferent neurones. these
neurones release transmitters such as calcitonin
gene-related peptide, activating interneurones (e.g.
cholinergic) which in turn stimulate an excitatory
neurone-producing contraction on the orad side of the
mucosal stimulus, and an inhibitory neurone on the
pharmacology
caudad side. this results in the familiar `peristaltic re¯ex'
actions of  xxxd3302xxx  on  xxxg1117xxx  receptors in vitro
with contraction above and relaxation below the site of
origination of the stimulus. the excitatory neurones
there are four main 5-ht receptor subtypes in the
mediate their effects through acetyl choline and subhuman gastrointestinal tract: 5-ht1, 5-ht2, 5-ht3 and

stance p. the transmitters for the inhibitory arm of the
 xxxg1117xxx .23, 24 the diverse effects of serotonin are due to
3,4 re¯ex are vasoactive intestinal peptie (vip), pituitory
stimulation of different receptor subtypes. like 5-ht3
3,4 adenylate cyclase activating peptide ( xxxg70xxx ) and nitric
receptors,  xxxg1117xxx  receptors are involved in motor,
oxide. grider et al. demonstrated, in a series of elegant
sensory and secretory functions.  xxxg1117xxx  receptors are
located on enterocytes, enterochromaf®n cells, neurones, and smooth muscle cells.  xxxd3302xxx  is a partial
agonist that displays high af®nity for human  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors; the af®nity constant is 18 nm.25  xxxd3302xxx 
has negligible af®nity for the  xxxg1116xxx , with kb of
7200 nm;  xxxd3302xxx  has an almost 10-fold greater
af®nity for 5ht-4 receptors over dopamine receptors.
the partial agonist activity of  xxxd3302xxx  was demonstrated in the guinea pig ileum. thus, whereas serotonin demonstrates 100% intrinsic activity and other
 xxxg1117xxx  agonists,  xxxd1708xxx  and  xxxd3097xxx , induce parallel dose±response curves to serotonin at 1±2 orders of
magnitude lower ec50,  xxxd3302xxx  demonstrated lower
intrinsic activity (21%), consistent with a partial
agonist.16 this observation may have important implications, in particular that the partial agonist may be less
likely to result in receptor down-regulation and hence
there would be less likelihood of tachyphylaxis or
tolerance. another potential advantage is that the
partial agonist may induce a second receptor state that
reduces the potential `overdrive' provided by the
endogenous ligand, serotonin.
 xxxd3302xxx  mimics the action of endogenous serotonin
released from enterochromaf®n cells, stimulating the

syndrome and healthy subjects. the pharmacokinetic
pro®les of  xxxd3302xxx  are also similar between genders
with no relevant changes in the elderly compared to
young adults. thus, dose adjustment is not needed in
elderly subjects or in subjects with mild to moderate
hepatic or renal impairment. no clinically relevant
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug±drug
interactions have been identi®ed; speci®cally, no clinically relevant interactions occur with theophylline (a
prototype substrate for cytochrome p450 1 a2), dextromethorphan (a prototype substrate for cytochrome
p450 2d6), digoxin, warfarin and oral contraceptives.

studies (figure 2), that the application of  xxxd3302xxx 
resulted in the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide,
 xxxg2240xxx  and vip; this release was inhibited by  xxxg1117xxx 
receptor antagonist (sdz 205±557), not by a 5-ht3
receptor antagonist (ly 278±584), suggesting considerable speci®city in the activation by  xxxd3302xxx .27
importantly, the same laboratory replicated these effects
in guinea pig colon, rat colon and human jejunum.
in vitro studies of propulsion in isolated segments of
guinea pig colon demonstrated that  xxxd3302xxx  stimulated the velocity of propulsion of arti®cial faecal pellets.28
 xxxd3302xxx 's effects on intestinal secretion have been
tested in crypt cells from rat distal colon; at low
nanomolar concentrations,  xxxd3302xxx  stimulated chloride and water secretion through an adenylate cyclase

vehicle had no such effect.31  xxxd3302xxx  stimulated small
bowel and colonic motility in dogs (estimated as a
motility index) in a dose-dependent manner.31 in dogs,
nguyen et al.30 demonstrated that intravenous  xxxd3302xxx  activated small intestinal rhythmic contractions,
and induced prolonged colonic contractions (figure 3)
that were associated with activation of the transit of a
radiotracer instilled into the proximal colon immediately
before the intravenous medication. in another model of
colonic transit,  xxxd3302xxx  reversed to normal the
retardation of transit induced by the a2 adrenergic
agonist, lidamidine.32 these effects of  xxxd3302xxx  in vivo
suggest that the medication may also activate gastrointestinal motility by a mechanism other than the
luminal route activation of the peristaltic re¯ex. this
alternative activation mechanism is likely to involve
 xxxg1117xxx  receptors on enteric cholinergic neurones.

motor actions of  xxxd3302xxx  on  xxxg1117xxx  receptors in vivo

activity of  xxxd3302xxx  on noxious colonic and
rectal hypersensitivity in animal models

in vivo studies show that  xxxd3302xxx  enhances motility at
all levels of the gastrointestinal tract. it stimulated
gastric emptying in rats and dogs under normal
or perturbed conditions.30, 31 during acoustic stress
(a model that retards gastric emptying) in dogs,
 xxxd3302xxx  0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg restored normal gastric
emptying rate to pre-stress levels; in contrast saline and

distention of the colorectum performed in a stepwise
fashion using a latex balloon (0.5±2.5 ml volume or
0±60 mmhg pressure) is an established model to assess
anti-nociceptive actions of medications; the level of the
stimulus can be sub-noxious to noxious. this results in
re¯ex hypotension or increased abdominal contractions
or a pseudo-affective behaviour such as withdrawal or

writhing, which are considered to be indices of pain.
 xxxd3302xxx  (1 mg/kg i.p.) inhibited the abdominal contractions in response to colorectal distention of the
rat.33 in contrast, the compound did not inhibit the
hypotensive response to acetylcholine, which does not
itself cause pain. other studies assessed the effects of
 xxxd3302xxx  on visceral sensitivity in cats.34 recordings
from single afferent units in dorsal s2 showed that
distension results in ®ring rates proportional to the
pressure in the distending balloon; the ®ring rate was
sub-maximal at 50 mmhg distension, which was used
as the standard stimulus to assess the effects of
 xxxd3302xxx  on sensation (figure 4).  xxxd3302xxx  dosedependently inhibited the ®ring of these rectal afferents
following rectal distension, without altering the rectal
compliance. this suggests that the effect was not the
result of relaxation or increased rectal compliance with
 xxxd3302xxx  and implies an effect on nociceptive afferents.
the effects of  xxxd3302xxx  were inhibited by a selective
 xxxg1117xxx  antagonist, sb203186, consistent with the
interpretation that the effects of  xxxd3302xxx  on sensation
are mediated through  xxxg1117xxx  receptors.19

effect of orally administered  xxxd3302xxx  on whole gut transit
in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
prather et al. evaluated the effect of 2 mg b.d. of
 xxxd3302xxx  for 1 week on whole gut transit using a
scintigraphic method; colonic ®lling, a surrogate of
orocecal transit time, was signi®cantly accelerated by
 xxxd3302xxx  relative to placebo (figure 5). the colonic
transit time was also accelerated in the  xxxd3302xxx  group
relative to pre-treatment (figure 6), although this effect
did not reach statistical signi®cance relative to placebo
treatment.36
clinical efficacy

pre-clinical and pharmacodynamic studies
phase i studies have been reviewed in detail under the
section on pharmacodynamics. in summary,  xxxd3302xxx 
increases the secretion of water and sodium from
colonocytes and enhances gastric, small bowel and
colonic transit in healthy subjects.29, 35  xxxd3302xxx 
accelerates small bowel transit in patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.36
although studies to date do not demonstrate any effect
of  xxxd3302xxx  on rectal compliance or sensation in
humans, the data from validated animal models of
visceral sensation suggest that it possesses properties
that reduce extrinsic afferent ®ring, and thus visceral
sensitivity. speci®cally,  xxxd3302xxx  inhibits ®ring of rectal
afferents during ramp distension of the rectum, and
reduces the pseudo-affective response to noxious colonic
distensions.  xxxd3302xxx  is devoid of effects on gastric acid
secretion, signi®cant central nervous system or cardiovascular effects.

other in vitro and pharmacodynamic studies have been
undertaken to explore the effects of this partial  xxxg1117xxx 
agonist on cardiac rhythms in animal models (the
isolated langendorff perfused rabbit hearts).37  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors are located on atrial muscle and the af®nity
constants for  xxxd1708xxx  and  xxxd3302xxx  for human  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors are 59 nm and 18 nm, respectively. in vitro
studies of the delayed recti®er potassium current (ikr)
were performed on the herg channel, guinea pig
papillary muscles, and isolated rabbit heart. in vivo
studies were also undertaken in conscious dogs. neither
in vitro studies, nor in vivo studies demonstrated any
5 relevant qtc (corrected qt interval) prolongation by
 xxxd3302xxx .19
thus, these data suggest that the effects on cardiac
repolarization observed with the benzamide  xxxg1117xxx 
agonist/5-ht3 antagonist  xxxd1708xxx  were not observed
with  xxxd3302xxx , suggesting that the new chemical class

of  xxxd3302xxx  (an  xxxd2951xxx  indole) does not share
the latter's potential to inhibit the ikr in cardiac
myocytes. speci®cally, ikr inhibition by  xxxd1708xxx  occurs
with an ic50 of 44 nm, and with  xxxd3302xxx  at
13 000 nm; similarly, qtc prolongation in the langendorff model in isolated rabbit heart occurs with 100 nm
 xxxd1708xxx  and > 10 000 nm  xxxd3302xxx . these data also
suggest that the arrhythmogenic potential of  xxxd1708xxx  is
not related to activation of the  xxxg1117xxx  receptors but to the
chemical structure of the benzamide.
phase iii studies
three phase iii trials were submitted to the fda in the
application for approval of  xxxd3302xxx .38, 39 two studies
had identical designs. following a 4-week placebo-free
baseline period, eligible patients were randomized in
equal allocation of approximately 250 patients per group

study, following a 4-week baseline period, patients were
randomized in equal numbers to either placebo, or a
®xed dose of 2 mg b.d., or a dose-titration regimen with
2 mg b.d. for the ®rst 4 weeks, followed by dose titration
at the end of week 4. the dose was increased to 6 mg b.d.
if the response was not complete or considerable relief for
6 at least 50% of the time during the ®rst 4 weeks.
the studies performed to date with  xxxd3302xxx  involved
large numbers of patients in placebo-controlled studies;
however, interpretation of results is complicated for a
number of reasons:
1 the decision to change study endpoints after the ®rst
trial was completed.
2 the lack of uniformity of study design in the third
titration trial with the clear increase in placebo
responsiveness after the 4th week of this titration trial.
3 the study endpoint pertained to the last 4 weeks of
the 12 week trial, not taking into consideration the
qualitative evidence of responsiveness in the ®rst
8 weeks of the trials.
4 the complicated nature of the criteria characterizing
responsiveness with the initial endpoint based on
complete or considerable global relief being associated
with a relatively low response rate for both active and
placebo groups.
de®ning study endpoints. it is unnecessary to document
the sequence of observations that led to the change in
study endpoints; it is suf®cient to note that the ®nal
de®nition of responder for the subject global assessment
of relief was: (i) at least 50% of the subject's global

assessments at study endpoint (i.e. at least two of the
weekly questions during the ®nal 4 weeks in the
12 week trial) were answered positively for complete
or considerable reliefðthis is identical to the original
study endpoint and served to assess the magnitude of
the effect; (ii) all of the subject's global assessments at
endpoint (®nal 4 weeks of trial) with at least somewhat
reliefðthis criterion was added to capture a persistent
positive response to medication at study endpoint.
the inclusion of the `somewhat' relieved category was
based on the documentation of the associations between
the several ef®cacy variables and the `somewhat'
relieved response. these associations were evaluated
in the ®rst phase iii trial in which changes from
baseline were evaluated for `responders' and `nonresponders' to either  xxxd3302xxx  or placebo. thus,
signi®cant differences (all p < 0.0001) between
responders and non-responders were identi®ed in
several parameters. these included the visual analogue
scale scores for the subject's global assessment of
abdominal discomfort/pain and bowel habit, the number of days with signi®cant pain and bloating and the
number of days with no bowel movement or hard/very
hard stools. importantly, this analysis also demonstrated that the `somewhat relieved' category was associated
numerically (e.g. visual analogue scale scores, daily
pain or bloating scores, number of days with speci®c
symptoms) about midway between considerable relief
and unchanged (table 1).40
the all-important question on which ef®cacy was
evaluated was the weekly question posed to patients:
`please consider how you felt this past week in regard to
your irritable bowel syndrome, in particular your

data were pooled across studies, ef®cacy in males was not
observed at study endpoint. although some improvements in the pooled assessment of ef®cacy were observed
during the ®rst month of therapy, this was not signi®cant. however, the sample sizes were considerably
smaller for males, and a type ii statistical error cannot
be excluded.
female patients in the  xxxd3302xxx  treatment groups
also demonstrated a higher response rate for the
subject global assessment of abdominal pain and

discomfort, with therapeutic gains over placebo of
9% in the 4 mg group and 10% in the 12 mg group
in study b301. similarly, the therapeutic gain was 9%
for the 12 mg group in study b351, but was not
signi®cant for the 4 mg group in this study. the dose
titration study showed no improvements for either
gender at either dose of  xxxd3302xxx  at study endpoint.
it is unclear whether this represented a true lack
of ef®cacy or the result of an inappropriate study
design.

ef®cacy in sub-group with constipation demonstrated during
run-in. although it was intended that patients with
constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome be
recruited for this study, the analysis of the stool
parameters recorded in the daily diaries demonstrated
that up to a ® xxxg818xxx  of patients across these studies actually
experienced diarrhoea or alternating bowel habit during
the 1-month placebo-free baseline. the study design did
not a priori exclude these participants from the trial,
since they still quali®ed as constipation-predominant
irritable bowel syndrome using rome criteria, and
hence they were randomized to receive therapy. however, if one restricts the ef®cacy analysis to those
subjects without loose bowel movements or a low (i.e.
loose) mean stool consistency during the run-in period,
the therapeutic gain over placebo is greater. indeed, in a
pooled analysis across the three studies, the therapeutic
gain over placebo averages about 15% for those with
normal consistency or hard stools. these data suggest
that the drug is more ef®cacious in those whose current
symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome include normal
consistency stool or hard stools associated with constipation.
weekly response rates in subjects' global assessment of
relief. an analysis of weekly response rates suggests that
the  xxxd3302xxx  treatment groups were often at a significant advantage over placebo treated patients during
the ®rst 4±6 weeks of therapy (e.g. in trial b351). in
these analyses, amelioration of bowel function was
frequently noted from the ®rst week of treatment. the
primary study analysis, however, discounted these
initial observations, focusing the study endpoint on
the last 4 weeks of therapy. this was intended to
demonstrate the advantageous position over placebo in
the last 4 weeks of therapy and to con®rm the
maintenance of the response to therapy. however, as
has been demonstrated in several studies of medications
applied to the treatment of functional or motility
disorders of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g.  xxxd1708xxx  in
chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction or alosetron in
diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome), the
placebo effect is still strong, even in the 3rd month of
therapy.42, 43 hence, the study analysis used was
particularly disadvantageous in the context of the
exercise of assessing ef®cacy, although the week by week
responsiveness suggests that the drug may indeed be
effective if used when the current bowel dysfunction is
constipation.

safety and tolerability

over 3500 healthy subjects or patients with irritable
bowel syndrome have received  xxxd3302xxx . the maximum daily dose was 200 mg in healthy subjects.
almost 1900 patients with irritable bowel syndrome
received the drug for > 85 days and more than 300
patients for > 330 days. approximately 12% of  xxxd3302xxx -treated patients developed diarrhoea in the phase
iii trials, compared with 5% of placebo-treated patients.
when observed, diarrhoea usually occurred during the
®rst week of the study, was transient in nature,
occurred as a single episode, and lasted a median of
2 days. in the group of patients (18%) who had
experienced at least one report of diarrhoea during
baseline, the occurrence of diarrhoea during the
12-week studies was only slightly higher than in the
overall study population, and only rarely (1.6% of
 xxxd3302xxx -treated patients) did patients discontinue
medication as a result of this adverse event. more than
10 000 electrocardiograms from participants receiving
 xxxd3302xxx  have been analysed to date, with no increased
frequency of qtc interval prolongations or dysrhythmias recorded.
the only signi®cant adverse events noted were
ovarian `cysts' and abdominal or pelvic surgery.
careful assessment of each report of ovarian `cysts'
suggested ®rst that many of these reports did not
actually demonstrate cyst formation and no causal
relationship to  xxxd3302xxx  could be identi®ed. moreover,
pelvic surgery was performed exclusively for intercurrent gynaecological problems, and abdominal surgery
was clinically indicated for unrelated surgical emergencies, such as acute appendicitis or drainage of a
pancreatic cyst.19
summary and conclusion

 xxxd3302xxx  is a potent  xxxg1117xxx  receptor partial agonist
which has shown ef®cacy in the treatment of abdominal
pain and discomfort, and constipation in female patients
with irritable bowel syndrome. to date, it has been
demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated except for the
adverse effect of transient diarrhoea in about 10% of
recipients. this is a known side-effect of this class of
compounds and the majority of patients chose not to
stop the drug during the trials. the exact mechanism of
its action in humans is as yet incompletely understood.
 xxxd3302xxx  appears to have an effect on visceral afferent

function, reducing pain and discomfort associated with
noxious distensions of the colorectum in animals and
increasing motility in the dog as well as accelerating
transit in the small bowel and colon. further studies are
necessary to more fully characterize the ef®cacy of the
medication and its mode of action.
it is likely that the drug will ®nd a place in the market
because available alternative strategies are sub-optimal.
the alternative competing classes of therapy for pain
and constipation in irritable bowel syndrome are
laxatives or serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, but the
evidence basis for their widespread use in practice is
weak or non-existent. current treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome often
requires the use of more that one medication to control
the multiple symptoms; the clinical trials suggest that
 xxxd3302xxx  may be ef®cacious on multiple symptoms as
well as overall well-being. there has been no trial
comparing  xxxd3302xxx  to an `established' irritable bowel
syndrome therapy (although this is clearly a challenge
in the absence of approved medications for the constipation-predominant group), or to a laxative. nevertheless, its safety pro®le suggests that physicians are likely
to consider it when patients do not respond to simpler
approaches such as ®bre and osmotic laxatives, or when
there are multiple symptoms including discomfort or
pain or impaired well-being associated with irritable
bowel syndrome. it is also clear that  xxxd3302xxx  will not
be indicated for all patients with irritable bowel
syndrome, and speci®cally that it may aggravate
diarrhoea in patients with other forms of irritable bowel
syndrome.  xxxd3302xxx  has not yet been shown to be
ef®cacious in male patients. further studies in phase iv
will be indicated to evaluate the effectiveness of this
medication in clinical practice.
based on the studies performed to date, an application
for the approval of  xxxd3302xxx  in the treatment of irritable
bowel syndrome was submitted to the united states
food and drug administration. it is anticipated that,
when the drug is approved, the package insert will
stress the following features: ®rst, that the drug results
in relief of abdominal pain and discomfort in female
patients with irritable bowel syndrome; second, that
the drug is not proven to be effective in diarrhoeapredominant patients; third, that the drug has only
been demonstrated to be ef®cacious in female patients
and that the optimal dose is 6 mg b.d.
