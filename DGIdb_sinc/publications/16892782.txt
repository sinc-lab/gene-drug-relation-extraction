background: recurrent and subclinical viral respiratory tract infections could immunologically exacerbate allergic airway
inflammation. however, the most appropriate treatment for virus-induced asthma exacerbation is yet to be established. the
effects of glucocorticoids in virus-induced acute asthma are controversial.
objective: to determine the effects of representative anti-inflammatory therapies for asthma— glucocorticoids and leukotriene receptor antagonists (ltras)—in mite allergen–sensitized and repeatedly low-grade respiratory syncytial virus (rsv)–
infected mice.
methods: dermatophagoides farinae–sensitized mice were inoculated twice with low-grade rsv and subcutaneously injected
with either a glucocorticoid or an ltra for 4 consecutive days. lung inflammation, cytokine profiles, lt production, and viral
rna in lung tissues were compared in 5 groups of 8 mice each: controls, d farinae allergen sensitized, d farinae sensitized and
rsv infected, d farinae sensitized and rsv infected with dexamethasone, and d farinae sensitized and rsv infected with
 xxxd2995xxx , an ltra.
results: allergic airway inflammation in d farinae mice was significantly enhanced by recurrent and low-grade rsv
infections (rlris). the glucocorticoid attenuated allergic airway inflammation, which was associated with  xxxg1180xxx  ( xxxg1180xxx )
and interferon-␥ (ifn-␥) suppression in lung-draining lymph nodes without affecting viral quantity. the ltra also attenuated
allergic airway inflammation in d farinae–rsv mice with concomitant inhibition of  xxxg1180xxx  but not ifn-␥. dermatophagoides
farinae allergen sensitization significantly increased lts in the airway, whereas rlris did not further enhance lt production.
conclusions: glucocorticoids and ltras significantly inhibit rlri-induced exacerbation of allergic airway inflammation by
distinct pathways. dexamethasone suppressed nonspecific cytokines, whereas viral rna did not increase via suppression of
immunity. in contrast,  xxxd2995xxx  specifically inhibited  xxxg1180xxx  but not ifn-␥.

introduction
viral respiratory tract infections represent the most common
trigger of acute exacerbation of asthma in children and
adults.1–3 although the underlying mechanism in virus-induced exacerbation of allergic airway inflammation remains
unknown, a variety of inflammatory molecules (eg, cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules) and inflammatory cells (eg, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and dendritic cells)
are critically involved.4 – 6 among the respiratory viruses,
respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) has attracted attention because it could potentially exacerbate and induce asthma.1,7,8
the mouse provides an excellent model to investigate the
possible synergy between allergen sensitization and rsv
infection at the immunologic level.8 –10 in natural infection,
viral infection occurs in much lower grade in adults than in
children, and it is unlikely that marked pulmonary infection

occurs in infected adults. thus, in the present study, dermatophagoides farinae allergen–sensitized balb/c mice
were repeatedly infected with low-grade rsv, which per se
did not cause pulmonary inflammation but induced an immunologic response in the host. this model could mimic subclinical and recurrent rsv infection in adults but not severe
rsv bronchiolitis in infants.11
the international guideline for asthma management recommends the early introduction of oral glucocorticoids or
increased inhaled glucocorticoids for the treatment of virusinduced exacerbation of asthma.12 there is concern that glucocorticoids might worsen viral infections because these
agents suppress cellular immunity. in fact, systemic administration of glucocorticoids delays viral clearance in infants
with severe rsv bronchiolitis who have received mechanical
ventilation.12,13 thus, in the treatment of virus-induced exacerbation of asthma, it remains uncertain whether glucocorticoids are good players as an anti-inflammatory agent or bad
players as an immunosuppressive agent. in addition, although
the anti-inflammatory effects of  xxxd2882xxx , a perfluorocarbon liquid, on airway abnormalities in rsv-infected mice

55

were demonstrated,14 its role in virus-induced asthma exacerbation is yet to be determined.
cysteinyl leukotrienes (cys-lts) are not only involved in
the early asthmatic response through their actions of airway
smooth muscle constriction and increase in vascular permeability but also show proinflammatory effects.15,16 montelukast has been demonstrated to inhibit  xxxg1180xxx  messenger rna
and cys-lts in mononuclear cells from human asthmatic
patients.17 it had been reported that viral respiratory tract
infections increase cys-lts in the airway,18 which could
exacerbate preexisting allergic airway inflammation in asthma.16 several human and animal studies18,19 showed the usefulness of anti-lt therapy for rsv infection. nonetheless,
only a few studies examined the effects of anti-lt therapy in
rsv-induced exacerbation of asthma.
based on this background, the present study sheds light on
representative anti-inflammatory therapies for asthma, ie,
glucocorticoids and lt receptor antagonists (ltras), as
drugs for rsv-induced acute exacerbation of asthma. our
working hypotheses are that (1) systemic administration of
glucocorticoids might increase viral quantity and (2) anti-lt
therapy might be effective in recurrent and low-grade rsv
infection (rlri) in a murine model of allergic asthma.
materials and methods
animals
female balb/c mice, 4 to 5 weeks of age, were obtained
from charles river (yokohama, japan). they were housed
under pathogen-free conditions at the laboratory animal
center for biochemical research, nagasaki university
school of medicine. all experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by the nagasaki university school of
medicine committee on animal research.
rsv preparation and inoculation
the a2 strain of human rsv (american type culture collection [atcc], rockville, md) was propagated in hep-2
cells (atcc) in a monolayer culture. for preparation of a
large stock of the virus, hep-2 cells were infected with the
atcc stock virus, and cell supernatant samples were collected 5 or 6 days after infection. the supernatant was centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°c to remove cellular
debris. the concentration of virus was adjusted as evaluated
by quantitative plaque-forming assay. the clear supernatant
was collected and stored at ⫺70°c. mice were infected under
light ether anesthesia (wako, osaka, japan) with low-grade
rsv (2 ⫻ 103 plaque-forming units in 50 ␮l) by means of
intranasal inoculation as previously described.11 controls
were sham-infected with hep-2 cell culture medium in a
similar manner. each experiment was repeated at least 3
times.
experimental protocols
five groups of 8 mice each were prepared. mice were immunized twice intraperitoneally on days 1 and 14 with 0.5 mg
of d farinae (lg-5339; cosmobio, tokyo, japan) precipi-

56

tated in  xxxd131xxx  (the d farinae, d farinae–rsv,
d farinae–rsv– xxxd2995xxx , and d farinae–rsv– dexamethasone groups) or with 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline
(pbs) (control group). these mice were then challenged
intranasally with 50 ␮l of pbs (control group) or 50 ␮g/50
␮l of d farinae allergen (all 4 d farinae groups) for 3
consecutive days (days 14 to 16 and days 35 to 37) and were
infected twice with hep-2 cell culture medium (control and
d farinae groups) or with live rsv (all 4 d farinae groups)
on days 17 and 38. after secondary infection, 0.5 mg of
dexamethasone (sigma-aldrich corp, st louis, mo) or 0.5
mg of  xxxd2995xxx , an ltra (ono pharmaceutical co, osaka,
japan), was subcutaneously administrated per mouse for 4
whole days on days 38 to 41 (the d farinae–rsv– dexamethasone and d farinae–rsv– xxxd2995xxx  groups, respectively). both drugs were dissolved in 99% ethanol. preliminary experiments showed that the solvent did not have
significant effects in d farinae–sensitized and rsv-infected
mice. lungs were harvested and bronchoalveolar lavage
(bal) was performed 4 days after secondary infections
(day 42). doses and routes of administration of d farinae
allergen, dexamethasone, and  xxxd2995xxx  were based on
previous studies.20
pulmonary inflammation and bal
the lungs were inflated via tracheostomy tube with 10%
phosphate-buffered formalin and then stored in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin, paraffin embedded, cut into 5-␮mthick sections, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. the mice
were humanely killed and the trachea was exposed and cannulated using a needle connected to a tuberculin syringe.
then the lung underwent bal with 0.5 ml of pbs, and the
recovered bal fluid (balf) was pooled. recovered balf
volumes ranged from 75% to 85% of instilled pbs. there
was no statistically significant difference in recovered balf
volumes between control and experimental groups. the supernatant was collected after centrifugation of balf and was
stored at ⫺80°c until it was assayed for cys-lts. the cell
suspension was centrifuged onto a glass slide using a cytospin
centrifuge at 850 rpm for 2 minutes at room temperature.
cytocentrifuged cell smears were air-dried and stained by
giemsa stain. at least 300 cells were examined microscopically in a blinded manner for a differential blood cell count.
concentrations of cys-lts in balf were assayed using
enzyme immunoassays (cayman chemical co, ann arbor,
mi).
reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction
analysis
lung tissue samples were homogenized using a tissue homogenizer. all the reagents for rna extraction and reverse
transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) were purchased from gibco brl (rockville, md). total rna was
isolated using trizol reagent, and 5 ␮g of total rna was
reverse transcribed in 20 ␮l of 50-mmol/l tris-hydrochloride (ph 8.3), 10-mmol/l dithiothreitol, 75-mmol/l potas-

(50-mmol/l  xxxd2988xxx , 10-mmol/l tris-hydrochloride [ph 9.0], 0.1% triton x100, and 1.25-mmol/l deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate), 1␮m each of sense-strand and
antisense-strand primers, and 0.01 u/␮l of taq polymerase.
for pcr, mouse ␤-actin and rsv n protein–specific primers
were designed from previous studies.21 twenty-five to 35
amplification cycles (denaturation at 94°c for 30 seconds,
annealing at 54°c for 30 seconds, and extension at 72°c for
1 minute) were used. the pcr products were separated by
means of agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium
bromide, and visualized under uv light.
analysis of cytokines
thoracic lymph nodes were prepared from the 5 groups of
mice, and mononuclear cells were prepared as previously
described.6 mononuclear cells (2 ⫻ 105/200 ␮l per well)
were cultured in the absence or presence of 100 ␮g/ml of d
farinae in 96-well plates for 48 hours as previously described.20 the concentrations of interferon-␥ (ifn-␥) and
 xxxg1180xxx  ( xxxg1180xxx ) in the supernatants, representing th1 and
th2 cytokines, respectively, were determined by means of
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (endogen, woburn,

results
dexamethasone and  xxxd2995xxx  attenuate d farinae
allergen–sensitized and rlri-induced allergic airway
inflammation
consistent with the previous study by our group,11 rlri
enhanced d farinae allergen–induced allergic airway inflammation (fig 1). lung abnormalities in the d farinae–rsv–
dexamethasone group were comparable with those in control
mice, and  xxxd2995xxx  attenuated allergic airway inflammation
in d farinae–rsv mice to a lesser degree than dexamethasone (fig 1). the balf analysis revealed that rlri significantly increased airway eosinophilia in d farinae mice (fig
2). this significance disappeared after either dexamethasone
or  xxxd2995xxx  use (fig 2). in this murine model, allergic
airway inflammation was immunologically enhanced after
rlri, and, thus, viral rna could be detected by rt-pcr in
primary rsv infection, whereas it became undetectable in
secondary rsv infection.11 in agreement with this, viral rna
could not be detected in d farinae–rsv mice in the present
study (data not shown). after dexamethasone or  xxxd2995xxx 
treatment, viral rna remained undetectable (data not

production but not ifn-␥ production. these results suggest
that the effects of glucocorticoids in cytokine inhibition are
nonspecific, whereas those of ltras are th2 specific.

discussion
using the rlri murine model of allergic asthma, the present
study found that (1) the systemic glucocorticoid inhibited
allergic airway inflammation associated with suppression of
th1 and th2 cytokines; (2) although the systemic glucocorticoid suppressed ifn-␥ production, viral rnas were not
increased; (3)  xxxd2995xxx , an ltra, attenuated allergic airway inflammation associated with  xxxg1180xxx  suppression; and (4)
the glucocorticoid and the ltras significantly reduced cyslts in the airway.
in contrast to previous studies,22,23 wherein mice were
infected with high-grade rsv, which per se causes the development of pulmonary inflammation, mice in the present
study were repeatedly infected with low-grade rsv, which
per se does not cause the development of pulmonary inflammation but induces significant inf-␥ production in lungdraining lymph nodes.11 thus, the present study mimics recurrent and subclinical rsv infections in adults, which
frequently occur in real life.24,25 a previous study11 showed
that rlri enhanced preexisting allergic airway inflammation
through immunologic mechanisms, wherein  xxxg1180xxx  is critically
involved.
in addition to non–virus-induced exacerbation, glucocorticoids are used for the virus-induced acute exacerbation of
asthma.12 however, the effects of glucocorticoids in virusinduced asthma remain controversial in human and animal
studies.26,27 in addition, although glucocorticoids are effective
for virus-induced airway inflammation, they potentially delay
viral clearance via the suppression of cellular immunity.28 in

annals of allergy, asthma & immunology

the present study, systemic administration of a glucocorticoid
ameliorated allergic airway inflammation in mite allergen–
sensitized and rlri mice with concomitant suppression of
th1 and th2 cytokines. although ifn-␥ was suppressed,
viral rna remained undetectable, supporting the current
guideline, which recommends early induction of oral glucocorticoids for virus-induced acute asthma.12
viral respiratory tract infections increase airway cyslts,18,29 which could worsen asthma.16,30,31 antileukotriene
therapies are effective for rsv infection in humans and
animals.18,32 we had originally expected that rlri might
increase cys-lts in the airway. unexpectedly, cys-lts were
significantly increased in the balf of d farinae allergen–
sensitized mice but were not further increased in d farinae–
rsv mice. as mentioned previously herein, the preexisting
allergic airway inflammation was immunologically enhanced
in the present study by low-grade rsv, which per se does not
cause the development of pulmonary inflammation. thus,
cys-lts, mediators of acute inflammation, do not seem to
increase in contrast to primary high-dose rsv infection.
although the concentration of cys-lts in balf did not
increase, ltras attenuated rlri-induced allergic airway
inflammation in d farinae mice, which was associated with
the inhibition of  xxxg1180xxx  but not ifn-␥. our group20,33 previously
reported that  xxxd2995xxx  inhibited allergen-specific  xxxg1180xxx  production in a murine model of allergic asthma and in passively
sensitized human lung tissue probably via a mechanism distinct from cys-lt receptor antagonism, which is currently
under investigation in the laboratory animal center for
biochemical research. because the ltra did not inhibit
ifn-␥, a th1 cytokine, it could be used more safely for the
treatment of virus-induced asthma compared with glucocorticoids, although the anti-inflammatory effects of ltras
were less potent than those of glucocorticoids.
the glucocorticoid and the ltra significantly inhibited d
farinae–induced cys-lt production in balf. it had been
reported that glucocorticoids do not inhibit cys-lt production34 and that  xxxd2995xxx  is originally an ltra but not a
cys-lt synthase inhibitor. although the exact mechanism is
yet to be determined, it is possible that both drugs significantly reduced the number of eosinophils, cys-lt–producing
cells in the airway, which subsequently resulted in cys-lt
reduction. in addition to eosinophils, mast cells and dendritic
cells also produce cys-lts.35,36 the effects of number and
activation of cys-lt–producing cells in the airway by these
drugs is an interesting issue for future research.
in conclusion, the present study demonstrates that glucocorticoids and ltras significantly inhibit rlri-induced
exacerbation of allergic airway inflammation. the glucocorticoid suppressed nonspecific cytokines, whereas viral rna
did not increase via suppression of cellular immunity.  xxxd2995xxx , an ltra, suppressed  xxxg1180xxx  but not ifn-␥, at least
probably not through cys-lt receptor antagonism. the role
of these anti-inflammatory therapies in virus-induced asthma
seems promising.
