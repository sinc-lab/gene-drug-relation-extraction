mechanisms of agonist-induced down-regulation of the human kappa-opioid receptor: internalization is required for down-regulation.  previously, we showed that the human kappa-opioid receptor (hkor) stably expressed in chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells underwent down-regulation after prolonged u50,488h treatment. in the present study, we determined the mechanisms underlying this process. u50, 488h caused a significant down-regulation of the hkor, although  xxxd2070xxx  did not. neither u50,488h nor  xxxd2070xxx  caused down-regulation of the rat kappa-opioid receptor. thus, similar to internalization, there are agonist and species differences in down-regulation of kappa-opioid receptors. expression of the dominant negative mutants arrestin-2(319-418) or dynamin i-k44a significantly reduced u50,488h-induced down-regulation of the hkor. coexpression of  xxxg970xxx  or  xxxg970xxx  and arrestin-2 permitted  xxxd2070xxx  to induce down-regulation of the hkor, although expression of arrestin-2 or dynamin i alone did not. expression of the dominant negative mutants  xxxg1915xxx -n133i or  xxxg1916xxx -n125i blunted u50,488h-induced down-regulation. pretreatment with lysosomal enzyme inhibitors [(2s, 3s)trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl ester or chloroquine] or proteasome inhibitors (proteasome inhibitor i, mg-132, or lactacystin) decreased the extent of u50,488h-induced down-regulation. a combination of chloroquine and proteasome inhibitor i abolished u50,488h-induced down-regulation. these results indicate that u50,488h-induced down-regulation of the hkor involves grk-, arrestin-2-, dynamin-,  xxxg1915xxx -, and  xxxg1916xxx -dependent mechanisms and receptors seem to be trafficked to lysosomes and proteasomes for degradation. thus, u50,488h-induced internalization and down-regulation of the hkor share initial common mechanisms. to the best of our knowledge, these results represent the first report on the involvement of both  xxxg1915xxx  and  xxxg1916xxx  in agonist-induced down-regulation of a  xxxg676xxx   xxxg1336xxx . in addition, this study is among the first to show the involvement of proteasomes in agonist-induced down-regulation of a  xxxg676xxx   xxxg1336xxx .
