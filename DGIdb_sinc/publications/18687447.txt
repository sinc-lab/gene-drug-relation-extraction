mitoxantrone, the ﬁrst immunosuppressant to receive fda approval for treatment of worsening relapsing–
remitting, secondary progressive, and progressive–relapsing multiple sclerosis (ms) is a dna  xxxg2312xxx 
inhibitor that has been associated with the development of acute promyelocytic myelogenous leukemia (apml).
central nervous system apml is a rare site of extramedullary involvement following mitoxantrone therapy. we
report a patient with history of multiple sclerosis who developed bilateral optic nerve involvement as the primary
manifestation of apml relapse following mitoxantrone treatment.

1. introduction
mitoxantrone, a dna  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitor, is used for the
treatment of worsening relapsing–remitting, secondary progressive,
and progressive–relapsing multiple sclerosis (ms). several case reports
have appeared in recent literature of acute  xxxg1785xxx 
(apml) occurring in patients with ms following mitoxantrone treatment [1–8]. while central nervous system (cns) involvement in apml is
uncommon [9–12], apml involvement of the optic nerves is extremely
rare and to the best of our knowledge only one report exists [13].
following the widespread use of  xxxd3417xxx  (atra) and
modern chemotherapy regimens that avoid high-dose  xxxd1790xxx  consolidation [14], reports of extramedullary relapses, most frequently
involving the cns have appeared [15]. we describe the clinical, radiologic, and histologic features of a patient with ms treated with mitoxantrone who had apml relapse involving the optic nerves.

vision in the right eye followed by diminished vision in the left eye a few
days later, associated with mild headaches and pain with eye movements.
she was ﬁrst diagnosed with ms in 1995 following an episode of
optic neuritis in her right eye. over the next decade, she was initially
treated with intramuscular  xxxg1140xxx  1-a and  xxxd2201xxx .
due to progression of her ms with increasing wheelchair dependence,
she received subcutaneous  xxxg1140xxx  1-a and mitoxantrone
between 2003 and 2005. in early 2005, in the setting of worsening
fatigue, a complete cell count revealed leukopenia. a subsequent bone
marrow biopsy conﬁrmed the diagnosis of apml and the presence of
the chromosome 15;17 translocation (pml–rar—a gene rearrangement). she was treated with atra,  xxxd1816xxx , and  xxxd1790xxx 
induction therapy followed by consolidation therapy with sequential
cycles of  xxxd2320xxx  and mitoxantrone. this was followed by maintenance therapy with  xxxd2573xxx , methotrexate, and atra. she
was in molecular remission since august 2005. in february 2007,
atra was discontinued and it was 3 months' later that she developed
blurred vision. a mri of the brain and orbits with and without contrast
obtained at visual symptom onset demonstrated stable appearance of
demyelinating plaques with evidence of bilateral optic nerve
enhancement. her visual symptoms were initially felt to be due to a
demyelinating optic neuritis. however, with progressive worsening of
vision bilaterally, she was referred to our neuro-ophthalmology clinic.
the neuro-ophthalmologic examination revealed a corrected visual
acuity of count ﬁngers at 1 ft in the right eye and 20/70 in the left eye.

she was unable to read the ishihara color plates. pupillary testing
showed a right relative afferent pupillary defect (apd). ocular
motility, slit lamp examination, and intraocular pressures were
normal. ophthalmoscopy in the right eye revealed mild swelling of
the optic nerve head with pallor. in the left eye, there was moderate
swelling of the optic nerve head with nerve ﬁber layer hemorrhages
and venous dilatation (fig. 1a). the macula, vessels, and periphery
were normal. kinetic visual ﬁeld testing demonstrated bilateral

central scotomas. her neurological examination was notable for leftsided weakness and sensory impairment.
a repeat mri of the brain and orbits with contrast revealed enhancement along the pre-chiasmatic and intracanalicular optic nerves
bilaterally, with patchy leptomeningeal enhancement in the frontal
and parietal regions (fig. 2). results of the cerebrospinal ﬂuid (csf)
examination revealed a wbc count of 77/mul (92% other cells, 6% neutrophils, 2% basophils), protein of 81 mg/dl, and glucose of 118 mg/dl.

cerebrospinal ﬂuid cytology demonstrated multiple immature myeloid
cells including promyelocytes with bilobed nuclei and cells containing
numerous auer rods, indicative of apml. a bone marrow biopsy was
negative for leukemic relapse, but polymerase chain reaction (pcr)
testing for the pml/rar—a fusion gene was positive, indicating systemic
involvement with apml.
the patient was treated with intrathecal (it) methotrexate, followed
by it  xxxd1790xxx  and iv methylprednisolone. twelve hours after it
 xxxd1790xxx  treatment, she had a precipitous deterioration of her visual
acuity to no light perception (nlp) in the right eye and 20/800 in the
left eye. the right pupil was unreactive to light with a large right relative
apd. radiation treatment was initiated and over the next month,
she received ten fractionated doses of 300 cgy to the orbits and chiasm.
her visual acuity stabilized to hand motions (hm) in the right eye and
20/400 in the left eye. ophthalmoscopic examination revealed
pale appearing optic discs bilaterally with residual swelling and
resolving nerve ﬁber layer hemorrhages (fig. 1b). repeat csf and bone
marrow analysis performed 10 weeks later showed absence of leukemic
cells. she received high dose  xxxd1790xxx  re-induction (3 g/m2 every 12 h
for 12 doses) for systemic remission and cns penetration. following
radiation her visual acuity was nlp in the right eye and cf at 1 ft in her
left eye.
3. discussion
acute  xxxg1785xxx , a subtype of aml, results from
reciprocal translocation of the long arms of chromosomes 15 and 17
[t [15,17] (q22;q12] with the creation of the fusion gene, pml/rar-a
[16]. in recent years, several reports of apml occurring in ms
patients following mitoxantrone treatment have appeared in the
literature [1–8]. the onset of apml following mitoxantrone therapy
is reported to occur between 5 months and 5 years following discontinuation of treatment [5]. ledda et al. reported two cases of apml
occurring amongst a cohort of 250 ms patients treated with mitoxantrone (0.8%) [5]. both of these patients had progressive–relapsing
ms and were treated with mitoxantrone for 15 months. the ﬁrst
patient presented with severe fatigue and gum bleeding, while in
the second patient apml was diagnosed after routine blood work
revealing pancytopenia. a recent report suggests that mitoxantrone
induces  xxxg2312xxx -mediated cleavage of the involved genes
in apml, pml and rar-a [7]. involvement of the cns from apml
is rare, affecting only 1% of patients [17]. the most common symptoms
at cns relapse include headache, nausea, vomiting, and seizure [9].
risk factors for developing apml in the cns include a high circulating
blast count, elevated lactate dehydrogenase activity, and having one
of the monocytic leukemic subtypes [18,19]. the only reported case
of apml involvement of the optic nerves was in a patient who
sustained multiple apml relapses and presented in disseminated
intravascular coagulation [13]. ophthalmic examination initially
showed bilateral subhyaloid and vitreous hemorrhages in the setting
of subarachnoid hemorrhage. despite resolution of the ocular
hemorrhages, the visual acuity remained at 20/200 ou and leukemic
involvement of the optic nerves was suspected due to bilateral
enhancement of the optic nerves on mri of the orbits and bilateral
thickening of the optic nerves on orbital echography. bone marrow
biopsy and csf cytology conﬁrmed a third relapse of apml. the
patient declined further chemotherapy, but received atra. four
months post atra treatment, the patient was in remission with a
visual acuity of 20/200 ou and resolution of optic nerve inﬁltration on
examination and imaging.
all-trans-retinonic acid, a  xxxd3105xxx  derivative, is the cornerstone in
the treatment of apml and results in remission by accelerating
terminal differentiation of malignant promyelocytes to mature
neutrophils [20]. it has been hypothesized that atra may play a role
in cns relapses of apml. by up-regulation of the adhesion molecules
on malignant promyelocytes and by induction of increased expression

of ligands for adhesion molecules  xxxg1127xxx  and  xxxg2406xxx , both of which are
implicated in the migration of leukocytes across the blood brain
barrier, atra may facilitate entry of malignant promyelocytes into the
csf [21]. older consolidation regimens for apml often included high
dose  xxxd1790xxx  which has reasonable cns penetration and may have
served as cns prophylaxis [22]. it is hypothesized that modern
regimens that avoid high dose  xxxd1790xxx  could result in the cns being
untreated, thereby increasing the risk for cns relapse [14].
the optic nerve is considered a pharmacologic sanctuary for chemotherapeutic drug penetration [23]. nikaido et al. proposed that there
could be a barrier created by leukemic inﬁltration surrounding the optic
nerves. this barrier could interrupt ﬂow of csf and impair the delivery of
cytotoxic drugs to the affected optic nerve [24]. this mechanism may
explain the rapid visual deterioration in our patient despite intrathecal
chemotherapy. early administration of focal radiation has been
described as an effective means of reducing leukemic cells in the optic
canal, thereby allowing adequate penetration of cytotoxic therapy into
the perineural space of the optic nerve [25].
in summary, recognition of features consistent with atypical optic
neuritis (such as progressive visual deterioration, bilateral simultaneous
optic nerve involvement, and prominent optic nerve swelling and
hemorrhages) in ms patients who have received prior mitoxantrone
therapy is important and when present, should raise the concern of
possible apml involvement of the cns. these patients should undergo a
prompt evaluation via mri of the brain and orbits and csf cytological
analysis. the onset of apml can be variable and may have a long latency
period. therefore, special clinical and hematologic vigilance for years
following discontinuation of mitoxantrone therapy is advised.
