abstract dopamine (da) regulates pain perception in the
central nervous system (cns). however, the mechanism of
the action of da in pain-related neurons of the parafascicular
nucleus (pf) is not clear. the present study aimed to determine the effect of da and its receptor antagonist,  xxxd1945xxx 
on the pain-evoked responses of the pain-excited neurons
(pen) and pain-inhibited neurons (pin) in the pf of rats and
to analyze the mechanisms underlying this effect. the trains
of electric impulses applied to the sciatic nerve were used as
noxious stimulation. the discharges of pen and pin in
the pf were recorded by using a glass microelectrode. the
results showed that, in the pf, intra-pf microinjection of da
(5 lg/0.5 ll) increased the frequency of noxious stimulation-induced discharges of the pen and decreased the frequency of those of the pin, while the intra-pf administration
of  xxxd1945xxx  (0.15 lg/0.5 ll) produced an opposite effect.
on the basis of the above-mentioned findings, we could
conclude that da and its receptors in the pf are involved in

introduction
dopamine (da) is one of the most abundant catecholaminergic neurotransmitters in the central nervous system
(cns) occurring in a wide variety of animals, both vertebrates and invertebrates. dopaminergic neurons are
mainly concentrated in the substantia nigra zona compacta, ventral tegmental area, and hypothalamus. in the
brain, da has many functions, including important roles
in behavior and cognition, voluntary movement, motivation and reward, inhibition of prolactin production
(involved in lactation), sleep, mood, attention, and learning. recently, da has also been shown to play a critical
role in modulating pain perception and natural analgesia
within the cns, including the spinal cord, the basal ganglia, insular cortex, cingulate cortex, thalamus, and periaqueductal gray (wood 2008). da receptors have been
widely reported as pharmacological targets for the study of
pain. the analgesic effect of da is generally elicited when
the da  xxxg656xxx  is activated (ansah et al. 2007;
coffeen et al. 2008; magnusson and fisher 2000; meyer
et al. 2009; taylor et al. 2003). however, in the periaqueductal gray, the activation of the da  xxxg655xxx 
attenuates pain, presumably via the activation of neurons
involved in descending inhibition (flores et al. 2004). in
addition, the activation of the  xxxg655xxx  in the insular
cortex appears to attenuate subsequent pain-related
behavior (burkey et al. 1999).

the parafascicular nucleus (pf), located in the medial
thalamus, is one of the important activators in the
ascending nociceptive pathway (willis and westlund
1997). basal ganglia, the subthalamic nucleus, and the
substantia nigra are projected to the pf. pallidal, cerebellar,
tectal, and motor cortical inputs are received from the pf
(ito and craig 2005). previous studies have indicated that
the ablation of the pf selectively reduces the emotional
suffering associated with acute and chronic pain in humans
(mark et al. 1963) and reduces responses to noxious
stimulation in animals (kaebler et al. 1975). electrophysiological recordings in animals demonstrated that noxious
stimulation activates nociceptive-responsive neurons
(cheng et al. 2009; dafny et al. 1990; guo and yuan 2008)
in the pf. the electrical activity of the neurons in the pf
varies with the intensity of pain stimulation and can be
used as an objective criterion of pain (sun et al. 1980;
weigel and krauss 2004; zhang 1973).
in the present study, we used extracellular electrophysiological recording techniques to determine the effects of
da and the da receptor antagonist,  xxxd1945xxx  on the
evoked discharges of pain-related neurons in the pf in
normal rats and analyzed the mechanism underlying this
effect.

materials and methods
animals
male and female sprague–dawley rats (200–260 g; animal centre of second affiliated hospital of harbin medical university; certificated no. 09-2-1) were used in this
study. rats were maintained on a lighting schedule of 14 h
light and 10 h dark at a temperature of 22 ± 2c. standard
food and water were provided ad libitum. the rats were
randomly and equally divided into three groups: (1) control
group, intra-pf administration of 0.5 ll saline; (2) da
group, intra-pf administration of 5 lg/0.5 ll da; and (3)
 xxxd1945xxx  group, intra-pf administration of 0.15 lg/0.5 ll
 xxxd1945xxx . all injections were completed within 2 min by
using a microliter syringe.
materials
da,  xxxd1945xxx , urethane, and saline were obtained from
standard suppliers in china.  xxxd3456xxx  chloride was
purchased from sigma (st louis, mo, usa).
neurosurgery and electrophysiological studies

openings were made in the skull, and they were covered
with  xxxd2648xxx . cerebellomedullary cistern was
opened to reduce the intracranial pressure. the right sciatic
nerves were isolated for noxious stimulation. rats were
fixed on a stereotaxic frame (sn-2; narishige, japan).
warm saline was injected into the peritoneal cavity of the
rats after surgery. their body temperature was maintained
at 36–37c. after 4–10 min, the rats were paralyzed with
 xxxd3456xxx  chloride (1 mg/kg), and artificial ventilation
of 60 times/min was maintained. single-unit recordings
were performed using a glass microelectrode (0.5–1.0 lm,
dc resistance 10–30 mx) filled with kcl (3 mol/l). the
glass microelectrode was inserted into the pf (ap, -2.2 to
-2.6 mm; r or l, 1.0–1.4 mm; h, 5.8–6.5 mm) by using a
micromanipulator (sm-21; narishige, japan) (pellegrino
et al. 1979). another glass microelectrode filled with drugs
was inserted into the pf (ap, -2.4 mm; r or l, 1.2 mm; h,
6.0 mm) by using the micromanipulator (sm-11; narishige, japan), and the drugs were administered using an
automatic pumping note instrument. the tidal volume,
heart rate and body temperature were monitored during the
experiment. the electrical activity was amplified by using
a microelectrical amplifier and recorded by the biological
experimental system, which was simultaneously monitored
using an oscilloscope (vc-10; nihon konden, japan). the
neural discharges were recorded concomitantly with the
electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerves by using a
double stainless electrode (delay 0, interval 5 ms, duration
0.3 ms, train 5) (sen-3301; nihon konden, japan) as
noxious stimulation. articular movement and hair touch
were set as the non-noxious stimulation to identify the
pain-related neurons. the discharge of each neuron was
recorded 3 times every 2 min, and the 30-min recording
was considered as a complete one.
definition of neurons
pain-related neurons refer to pain-excited neuron (pen)
and pain-inhibited neuron (pin). neurons that responded
by increasing the discharge frequency to noxious stimulation were defined as pen (zhang 1973), while those
that responded by decreasing the discharge frequency to
noxious stimulation were defined as pin (sun et al.
1980).
observing index
(1) net-increased value (niv, hz) refers to the difference
of pen or pin between the average frequency of evoked
discharges after noxious stimulation and the average frequency of discharges within 2 s before noxious stimulation. (2) latency (s) refers to the time from the noxious
stimulation to the appearance of the pen discharges. (3)

inhibitory duration (id, s) refers to the latency time from
the noxious stimulation to the appearance of the pin
discharges.
histological identification
at the end of the experiment, pontamine sky blue was
diffused out from the microelectrode with a negative direct
current (30 la, 15 min) to identify the tip position.
statistical analysis
data were scanned into the computer with powerlab/8sec
(adinstruments) and analyzed with chart v5.3 software
(australian). all data were expressed a mean ± sem and
analyzed using the spss 16.0 software. statistical differences were evaluated by repeated measures anova,
while the post hoc test was used to compare the differences
between the two groups, p \ 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

results
effects of saline on the evoked discharges
of the pf neurons
significant modifications in neither pen nor pin of the pf
neurons were observed during the 30 min after the
administration of saline (figs. 1a, 2a).
effects of da on the evoked discharges
of the pf neurons
in the da group, the niv of pen was 7.92 ± 0.94 hz,
and the latency was 0.31 ± 0.08 s. immediately after the
intra-pf administration of da, the niv of pen began to
increase and the latency began to shorten (fig. 1b). at
2 min after the administration of da, the niv increased
to 14.48 ± 2.97 hz (f = 11.176, p = 0.0032), and the
latency shortened to 0.14 ± 0.05 s (f = 25.864, p \
0.0001). these effects reached the peak at 6 and 8 min
after the administration of da; the niv increased to
20.42 ± 3.27 hz (f = 46.666, p \ 0.0001) at 6 min,
increasing by 157.83% compared with that before
administration, and the latency shortened to 0.10 ± 0.04 s
(f = 57.552, p \ 0.0001) at 8 min. during 0–12 min
after the administration of da, the niv (f = 19.754,
p \ 0.0001) and latency (f = 33.056, p \ 0.0001) of
pen showed obvious changes compared with those of the
control group (fig. 3). at 20 min after the administration
of da, the niv and latency of pen returned to the values
observed before treatment.

587

the average niv of pin was -4.03 ± 0.70 hz, and the
average id of pin was 0.31 ± 0.05 s. at 2 min after the
injection of da, the average niv began to reduce and id
began to prolong (fig. 2b). the average niv was
-8.94 ± 1.73 hz (f = 18.302, p = 0.0011), and the
average id was 0.53 ± 0.19 s (f = 5.378, p = 0.04) at
2 min after the injection. these reactions reached a peak
value at 6 and 8 min after the injection; the average niv
was -13.65 ± 2.01 hz (f = 81.517, p \ 0.0001) at
8 min, reducing by 238.71% compared with that before the
injection, and the id prolonged to 0.89 ± 0.24 s
(f = 28.717, p = 0.0002) at 6 min. during 0–12 min
after the injection, the average niv (f = 60.542,
p \ 0.0001) and id (f = 19.249, p = 0.001) of pin
showed obvious changes compared with those of the control group (fig. 4). at 20 min after the injection, the niv
and id of pin returned to the values observed before
treatment.
effects of  xxxd1945xxx  on the evoked discharges
of the pf neurons
at 2 min after the administration of  xxxd1945xxx , the average
niv of pen significantly decreased from 7.94 ± 0.77 to
4.63 ± 1.33 hz (f = 57.637, p \ 0.0001), and the latency
prolonged from 0.31 ± 0.08 to 0.69 ± 0.31 s (f = 8.176,
p = 0.009) (fig. 1c). these reactions reached a peak value
at 6 min after the injection; the average niv decreased to
3.28 ± 0.83 hz (f = 202.669, p \ 0.0001), and the
latency prolonged to 0.96 ± 0.37 s (f = 14.049, p =
0.0011). during 0–12 min after the injection, the niv
(f = 108.119, p \ 0.0001) and latency (f = 9.882,
p = 0.005) of pen showed obvious changes compared
with those of the control group (fig. 3).
at 2 min after the administration of  xxxd1945xxx , the
average niv of pin significantly increased from
-4.15 ± 0.74 to -2.88 ± 0.96 hz (f = 7.308, p =
0.016), and the id shortened from 0.31 ± 0.07 to
0.19 ± 0.04 s (f = 16.039, p = 0.0011) (fig. 2c). these
reactions also reached a peak value at 8 min after the
injection; the average niv increased to -1.61 ± 0.61 hz
(f = 93.828, p \ 0.0001), and the id shortened to 0.12 ±
0.03 s (f = 28.396, p \ 0.0001). during 0–12 min after
the injection, the niv (f = 36.542, p \ 0.0001) and id
(f = 26.348, p \ 0.0001) of pin showed obvious changes
compared with those of the control group (fig. 4).

activities of the evoked discharges of pen and simultaneously potentiated those of pin. the responses of neurons
showed that da and  xxxd1945xxx  play different roles in pain
modulation in the pf. pen and pin can be considered as
indexes of pain research (bian et al. 1993). the responses
of pen and pin are completely opposite to identical substance, which synchronously account for the effects of da
and  xxxd1945xxx  during pain modulation. during the preliminary experiment, we used different dosages of da and
found that da acted in a dose-dependent manner. the used
dosage (5 lg/0.5 ll) of da was both adequate and effective for recording neuronal discharges. it is interesting to
note that the curves of the  xxxd1945xxx  (5 lg/0.5 ll) group
were not as distinct as those of the da group. this could be
because the used dose of  xxxd1945xxx  was considerably high.
the small dose of  xxxd1945xxx  (0.15 lg/0.5 ll) was both
adequate and effective for recording neuronal discharges.
we attempted to increase the dosage of  xxxd1945xxx  during
the experiments. however, it seemed impossible to record
a complete neuronal discharge.
it is well known that the pf plays a major role in nociception in animals and humans. there are two types of pf

neurons that are classified according to their response pattern following noxious stimulation. one type of pf neurons
that were excited after the stimulation is classified as pen,
and the second type of pf neurons whose responses were
inhibited after stimulation is classified as pin. both the
types of neurons can be used as an objective criterion of
nociceptive responses. pain-evoked discharges of pf neurons can be inhibited by stimulation of brain regions such as
the central gray matter, dorsal raphe nucleus, and locus
coeruleus (li et al. 1984; liu et al. 1993; qiao and dafny
1988; zhang et al. 1998). inhibition of pain-evoked discharges of pf neurons can also result from analgesic treatment, including acupuncture, as well as by analgesic drugs
such as morphine (zhang 1973). in our experiment, we
found that da increased the evoked discharges of pen and
simultaneously attenuated those of pin, and da receptor
antagonist,  xxxd1945xxx  attenuated the evoked discharges of
pen and simultaneously increased those of pin. therefore,
the present study provides additional electrophysiological
evidence for the antinociceptive effects of  xxxd1945xxx  and
hyperalgesic response of da by intra-pf injection. simultaneous recording of the responses of dopaminergic neurons

to peripheral noxious stimuli in the substantia nigra (sn)
and the lateral habenula (hbl) confirms that the responses
are opposite: excitation of the neurons in the hbl corresponded to an inhibition of the neurons in the sn, and vice

versa. the responses of the hbl and pf neurons to noxious
inputs are similar (benabid 2009). these effects of da and
 xxxd1945xxx  may be mediated by evoked dopaminergic neurons, which project to the pf.

results of previous studies suggest that the dopaminergic system in the brain is primarily involved in the modulation of nociception. some studies indicated that low
dopaminergic activity can be associated with high pain
sensitivity, and vice versa (cervenka et al. 2006;
jääskeläinen et al. 2001; treister et al. 2009; wood et al.
2007). however, a team of researchers at the university of
michigan induced pain in their subjects and concluded that
the da system in the brain is highly active when an individual experiences pain, such as muscle pain. da plays an
important role in pain modulation, but there are some
discrepancies in the reported effects of da, ranging from
excitation to inhibition of neurons. the different effects
were probably induced in the different regions of the cns:
a da d1 agonist was reported to increase hyperalgesia in
the nucleus raphe magnus (phillips et al. 1992) and the
spinal cord (gao et al. 2001), while da d1 antagonist was
reported to attenuate the analgesia in the periaqueductal
gray (flores et al. 2004), anterior cingulate cortex (lópezavila et al. 2004), and rostral agranular insular cortex
(burkey et al. 1999). in addition, different da receptors or
different experimental approaches were probably responsible for the different effects produced. the activation of
d2 or the blockade of the  xxxg655xxx  elicited antinociception in the rostral agranular insular cortex (coffeen
et al. 2008) and the spinal cord (gao et al. 2001). intrathecal administration of the da agonist, apomorphine
failed to influence the tail-flick latency even at high doses,
whereas it produced a dose-dependent increase in the hot
plate and acetic acid writhing responses (jensen and yaksh
1984). intraperitoneal injection of cocaine has been
reported to activate da receptors in the pf producing
analgesia (shyu et al. 1992).
in the cns, there are five subtypes of da receptors,
namely, d1 through d5, and the da d2 receptors are the
most important ones in pain modulation. the d2 receptors
are localized in the pf (wamsley et al. 1989). d2 receptors
sites have been reported to be present in the pf (rieck et al.
2009). high expression of the d2 mrna is evident in the
pf (hurd et al. 2001). da exerts its effects by acting on its
receptor;  xxxd1945xxx  is a da receptor antagonist, and it
plays a primary role mostly by blocking the da d2
receptors (cure et al. 2004). in the present study, we found
that the administration of da produced algetic action. on
the other hand,  xxxd1945xxx  produced antinociception in the
pf. this suggests that da directly induces hyperalgesia in
the pf. therefore, in the pf, da may play a role via the
activation of the da d2 receptors, and  xxxd1945xxx  may play
a role via the blockade of the da d2 receptors. however,
whether other da receptor subtypes also play a critical role
in the analgesic action in the pf needs to be investigated.
in conclusion, the data of this study indicated that da
and pf are involved in pain modulation. the activation of

the pathway related to da receptors may be responsible for
the effect produced by da.
