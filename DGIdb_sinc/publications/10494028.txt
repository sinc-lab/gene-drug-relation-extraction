abstract
fibrates are widely used drugs which lower
triglycerides and increase hdl concentrations in serum. recent findings from our laboratory have shown that fibrates repress
apolipoprotein (apo) ciii gene expression, an
effect that explains partially the triglyceridelowering activity of these drugs. the goal of
the present study was to compare the effect
of various fibrates on apo ciii gene expression in the human hepatoblastoma cell line
hepg2. first, we demonstrate that the level
of apo ciii secretion by hepg2 cells is controlled by serum factors whereas apo ciii
mrna levels are not and even increase under conditions when apo ciii secretion dramatically decreases. twelve different fetal
calf serum batches were tested during this

study and apo ciii secretion in cell medium
could only be detected with three of them.
the effect of serum on apolipoprotein secretion was more pronounced for apo ciii
whereas other apolipoproteins (apo e, apo b,
apo aii and apo ai) were affected to a lesser
extent. under serum conditions allowing apo
ciii secretion, treatment with the peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor (ppar)·
activators  xxxd2096xxx , gemfibrozil and wy14643 result in a marked lowering of apo ciii
secretion and gene expression, this effect being most pronounced with wy-14643. comparison of the activity of a ppará-specific
ligand, the antidiabetic thiazolidinedione,
 xxxd3147xxx  and a ppar· ligand wy-14643
showed a marked decrease of apo ciii secretion and gene expression after activation of
ppar· but not ppará. in conclusion, fibrates
down-regulate apo ciii gene expression in
human hepg2 cells, most likely via ppar·
but not via ppará. however, these effects are
only observed in hepg2 cells cultured under
appropriate conditions.

apolipoprotein (apo) ciii is a component
of several classes of plasma lipoproteins such
as triglyceride-rich particles (chylomicrons,
very low density lipoproteins (vldl)), intermediate density lipoproteins (idl) and high
density lipoproteins (hdl). apo ciii is produced predominantly in the liver and to a lesser extent in the intestine [1].
the importance of apo ciii in triglyceriderich lipoprotein metabolism is demonstrated
by the positive correlation between apo ciii
levels and triglyceride concentrations in plasma from normal or dyslipemic subjects [2].
patients deficient in apo ciii exhibit an increased catabolism of vldl and an unusually efficient conversion of vldl to idl and
low density lipoproteins (ldl) [3]. in contrast, elevated apo ciii synthetic rates have
been observed in hypertriglyceridemic patients [4]. fat ingestion is associated with
increased levels of apo ciii-containing apo b
lipoproteins [5]. in human apo ciii transgenic mice, triglyceride levels were found to be
proportional to apo ciii gene expression and
human apo ciii plasma concentrations [6, 7].
inversely, transgenic mice with a targeted disruption of the apo ciii gene were shown to be
protected from postprandial hypertriglyceridemia [8]. in vitro apo b binding to the ldl
receptor was inhibited by apo ciii and this
inhibition was dependent of the apo ciii level
[9, 10] and in vivo the catabolism of apo bcontaining lipoproteins was increased in subjects with apo ciii deficiency [11].
relatively few factors regulating apo ciii
secretion are described, among which are cytokines activating the nfîb transcription
pathway [12] and insulin [13]. furthermore,
hypolipidemic drugs such as fibrates and, to a
lesser extent, statins reduce apo ciii-containing particles in plasma [14, 15]. transcriptional regulation of the apo ciii gene by

fibrates [16, 17] has been studied in vivo in
rodents. the mode of action of these hypolipidemic drugs in suppressing plasma apo ciii
levels has been suggested to result from transcriptional suppression of the apo ciii gene
mediated via the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar) [18]. the mechanism of apo ciii repression by fibrates may
involve competition by ppar for binding of
the strong activator hepatic nuclear factor-4
(hnf-4) to a cis-acting sequence on the apo
ciii promoter as well as a direct repression of
hnf-4 expression. recently it was demonstrated that in ppar·-deficient mice, serum
triglyceride levels and hepatic apo ciii
mrna levels were unaffected by fibrate treatment [18]. in primary cultures of human hepatocytes, fibrates have been shown to downregulate apo ciii expression in a manner
independent of the induction of peroxisomal
enzyme activity [19, 20].
however, the low availability of human
hepatocytes has led to the use of human cell
lines. the human hepatoblastoma-derived
cell line, hepg2, expresses many functions of
human hepatocytes. this cell line synthesizes
and secretes lipoprotein fractions within the
density ranges of vldl, ldl and hdl [21–
23]. much information on the regulation of
apo b-containing lipoproteins have been obtained from these cultured liver cells [24, 25].
passilly et al. [26], comparing human hepg2
and rat fao cells, found that ciprofibrate
treatment influenced cell cycle, palmitoylcoa oxidase activity and peroxisome proliferation in rat but not in human cells. hepg2
cells have furthermore been used to study
transcriptional regulation of the apo ciii gene
[12, 27] and these cells secrete also apo ciii
[23, 28, 29]. in this paper we studied the optimal conditions to measure apo ciii secretion
by hepg2 cells with an appropriate enzyme
immunoassay to quantify apo ciii. our results indicate that in certain cases, apo ciii

introduction

materials and methods
products
twelve different fetal calf serum (fcs) batches
were tested during this study and apo ciii secretion in
cell medium could only be detected with three of them.
two representative batches were used for the experiments described here, gibco brl 40q1443k fcs
(fcs1) allowing apo ciii secretion and a gibco brl
40g1646j fcs (fcs2) impairing apo ciii secretion.
lipoprotein-deficient fcs (lpds) was obtained by
two successive ultracentrifugations of fcs (kbr density: 1.21 g/ml) for 24 h at 100,000 g; the infranate
lpds was dialyzed against 0.01 m sodium phosphate
buffer ph 7.4, 0.15 m nacl (pbs). lpds was deactivated on activated charcoal.
 xxxd3147xxx  and fenofibric acid were kind gifts of
dr. berthelon (merck-lipha sa, lyon, france) and
dr. alan edgar (laboratoires fournier, daix, france).
pirixinic acid (wy-14643) was from chemsyn science
laboratories, kans., usa, and gemfibrozil was purchased from sigma, st. louis, mo., usa.
cells
hepg2 cells (hepatocellular carcinoma, ref. atcc:
hb8065) were grown and maintained in dulbecco’s
modified eagle’s medium containing 10% fcs (v/v),
2 mm glutamax (gibco brl), penicillin (1,000 u/ml),
streptomycin (1,000 u/ml) and gentamicin. cells were
grown in 75-cm2 flasks and before experiments transferred in 28.6-cm2 plates (3 ! 106 cells/plate: 105 cells/
cm2) in fcs medium for 24 h. culture medium was
removed and 3 ml of experimental medium was added
for 24 h then removed for analysis. in experiments
where secretion was studied for 48 h a fresh experimental medium was provided after the first 24 h.
usually experimental medium was the same as
growing medium except that fcs was removed and
replaced by 2 g/l bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa). in

apolipoprotein ciii secretion by
hepg2 cells

some experiments indicated apolipoprotein secretion
was studied in medium where bsa was replaced by
fcs or lpds (10% v/v). when fibrates were added to
experimental medium they were dissolved in dmso
then diluted in the medium. the final dmso concentration was 0.1% (v/v) and dmso was also added to
control cells without fibrates. cells were washed with
pbs then scraped in 2 ml of 4 m guanidine isothiocyanate buffer. cell proteins were measured by the coomassie blue method (biorad) and mrna extracted.
each experiment was performed in triplicate and results are expressed as the mean b sd.
apolipoprotein determinations by enzyme
immunoassay
human apo ciii was measured by a noncompetitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (sandwich
elisa) as described previously [30] using specific
antibodies. briefly, polystyrene microtiter plates were
coated with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human apo ciii. cell secretion medium samples diluted with 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m
nacl buffer ph 7.4 containing 1% albumin (phosphate buffer) were added to the wells along with the
standards and controls and incubated for 2 h at 37 ° c.
after incubation, the plates were washed 4 times with
phosphate buffer and the corresponding rabbit polyclonal peroxidase labeled anti-apolipoprotein antibody
was added. the plates were incubated for 2 h at 37 ° c
and then washed. 30 min after the addition of peroxidase substrate (o-phenylenediamine dichloride; sigma
chemical co., st. louis, mo., usa), the coloration
was measured at 492 nm using an automated microplate reader model el340 (bio-tek instruments, inc.,
winooski, vt., usa). a pool of 400 different plasma
samples was used as secondary standard. intra- and
interassay reproducibility was respectively 6.5 and
11.6%.
human apo e [31], apo aii [32], apo ai [33] and
apo b [34] levels were measured by noncompetitive
elisas adapted from previously described methods.
rna extraction and analysis
rna extractions, northern and dot-blot hybridizations, and quantification of apo ciii mrna levels
were performed as described previously [20]. the
cdna clone 36b4 [35] encoding for the human acidic
ribosomal phosphoprotein po [36] was used as control. cdna probes were labeled by random primed
labeling (boehringer mannheim). filters were hybridized to 1.5 ! 106 cpm/ml of each probe as described
[37]. they were washed once in 0.5 ! ssc and 0.1%
sds for 10 min at room temperature and twice for

gene expression does not correlate with apo
ciii secretion and that both parameters
should be taken into account when performing regulation studies. using this well-defined
system, we go on to study the activities of different fibrate ppar· activators and of a
ppará activator, the antidiabetic thiazolidinedione  xxxd3147xxx , on apo ciii secretion
and transcription in hepg2 cells.

western blot analysis
cells were washed twice in ice-cold pbs and harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer containing pbs, 1% triton x-100, and a freshly prepared protease inhibitor
cocktail (icn, orsay, france) (10 mg/ml  xxxd502xxx ,
1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 5 mg/ml
edta-na2) to which 1 mm pmsf was added. cell
homogenates were collected by centrifugation at
13,000 rpm at 4 ° c. electrophoresis of 100 ìg of protein lysate was performed through a 10% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions (sample buffer
containing 10 mm dithiothreitol (dtt)). proteins
were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and
nonspecific binding sites were blocked overnight at
4 ° c with 10% skim milk powder in tbst (20 mm
tris, 55 mm nacl, 0.1% tween 20). membranes were
subsequently incubated for 4 h at room temperature in
5% skim milk-tbst containing specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against n-terminal ppar·
[38] or ppará peptides [39]. after incubation with a
secondary peroxidase conjugation, signals were visualized by chemiluminescence (amersham, bucks., uk).

results

first hepg2 cells were cultured for several
weeks in medium constituted with either fcs
batch representative of three different batches
allowing apo ciii secretion (fcs1) or an fcs
batch representative of 9 batches impairing
apo ciii secretion (fcs2). apo ciii secretion
experimental medium without fcs, but containing bsa 2 g/l, was used to avoid a direct
effect of fcs on apo ciii secretion. figure 1a
shows that apo ciii secretion could only be
detected in significant amounts from cells cultured in fcs1. apo ciii secretion by cells
grown in fcs2 was undetectable (!1 ng/mg
cell protein). no differences in cell growth
(measured by the cell protein content) were
observed after 24 or 48 h of incubation of cells
previously grown in fcs1 or in fcs2. an
unexpected result was that apo ciii mrna
levels were not decreased but rather increased
in cells cultured in fcs2 (fig. 1b), indicating
that the effect of fcs2 was not due to a dedifferentiation of the hepatoma cells.

30 min at 65 ° c and subsequently exposed to x-ray
films (x-omat-ar, kodak). autoradiograms were
analyzed by quantitative scanning densitometry (biorad gs670 densitometer) and results normalized to
36b4 mrna levels as described [37].

when cells were cultured for several weeks
in fcs2 medium and then switched to fcs1
medium, apo ciii secretion could not be
restored. inversely when cells were grown in
fcs1 medium and then switched to fcs2
medium, the apo ciii secretion diminished
after each passage and was abolished after a
few weeks. in order to study the short-term
influence of the different batches of fcs on
apo ciii secretion, cells cultured in fcs1
were switched to the experimental medium
containing either fcs1, fcs2, lpds prepared from fcs2, or bsa for 48 h. in figure 2,
it is shown that after 48 h, apo ciii secretion
was similar in bsa and in fcs1 medium,
whereas fcs2 inhbited its secretion after 48 h
of incubation. the difference in secretion
compared to bsa medium suggests the presence of an inhibitor of apo ciii secretion in
fcs2, since secretion in bsa and fcs1 medium were nearly identical. furthermore, secretion of apo ciii by cells cultured in lpds
from fcs2 was also decreased, indicating that
the hypothetical inhibitor is not lipophilic.
in order to study whether certain fcs
batches abolished protein secretion by the
hepg2 cells in general, we investigated their
influence on the secretion of other apolipoproteins. no major morphologic change can

indicate that the secretion of all other apolipoproteins analyzed was much less affected by

apolipoprotein ciii secretion by
hepg2 cells

though the secretion of certain other apolipoproteins was also decreased when cultured in
fcs2, their decrease was much less pronounced being 1.3-fold for apo e, 1.84-fold
for apo b and 2.09-fold for apo ai. apo aii
secretion decreased to a much larger extent
(by 7.5) but was not abolished. under the
same conditions, apo ciii secretion decreased
by a factor which was at least 31.9.
the nature of fcs used to culture the
hepg2 cells could therefore limit the use of
hepg2 cells to study factors regulating apo
cii secretion. however, our results indicate
that it is possible to maintain apo ciii secretion depending of the fcs used. to further
analyze the effects of cell culture conditions,
we studied the influence of cell density on apo
ciii secretion. therefore, cells grown in fcs1
medium were plated at different densities

(104–105 cells/cm2) and cultured for 24 h in
the same medium. the medium was then
removed and the experimental bsa medium
was added. apo ciii secretion (ng/24 h), measured after 24 h, was directly dependent on
the cell density at the beginning of the experiment (fig. 3). thus when expressed as ng of
apo ciii per mg of cell protein in the plate at
the end of the experiment (76.88 b 9.6 ng/mg
cell protein), apo ciii secretion was constant.
these results demonstrate that, within the
limits of the cell density tested in the experiment, apo ciii secretion is proportional to the
number of cells and that the measure of the
protein content at the end of the experiment is
a reflection of the cell density at the beginning. therefore, the following experiments
were performed using cells cultured in fcs1
medium and plated at a cell density of 105
cells/cm2. results are expressed as ng apo ciii
secreted per 24 h and per mg cell protein measured at the end of the experiment. under
these well-defined conditions the intra-assay
reproducibility of the apo ciii secretion measurement was tested on 15 plates (105 cells/
cm2) and the cv was 18.5%. however, apo
ciii secretion can vary between experiments,
and factors regulating apo ciii secretion
should be tested within the same experiment.
the assay was then used to test the effect of
different fibrates on apo ciii secretion. therfore, cells were grown in fcs1 medium, followed by plating for 24 h in the same medium, and addition of the experimental medium which included different fibrates. as
shown in figure 4a, fenofibric acid, gemfibrozil and wy-14643 inhibited apo ciii secretion. apo ciii mrna levels decreased in parallel after treatment with the three drugs
(fig. 4b), the effect being more pronounced for
wy-14643. the use of  xxxd2096xxx  instead of
fenofibric acid partially impaired the inhibitory effect on apo ciii secretion probably
because cells cannot hydrolyze  xxxd2096xxx  es-

ter in its active acid derivative (data not
shown).
since cells grown in fcs2 medium did not
secrete apo ciii, the influence of fibrate treatment on apo ciii secretion could not be determined. however, we observed, as shown in
figure 1b, that apo ciii mrna was expressed
in cells cultured in fcs2. when these cells
were treated for 48 h with fenofibric acid
(500 ìm) or wy-14643 (500 ìm), apo ciii
mrna levels remained unchanged (respectively 123 b 6 and 90 b 6% of the control
level in fcs2). by contrast, in the same cells,
stimulation of apo aii mrna by these fibrates was maintained (respectively 150 b 8
and 171 b 13% of the control level).
finally, the influence of a specific ppará
activator, the thiazolidinedione  xxxd3147xxx 

[40, 41], was tested on apo ciii secretion and
gene expression. addition of  xxxd3147xxx  did
not decrease apo ciii gene expression and
secretion at concentrations as high as 30 ìm
(table 2). higher concentrations (100 ìm) had
a toxic effect on the cells. to explain the specific effect of ppar· ligands on apo ciii
secretion, we determined by western blot
analysis which ppars are expressed in
hepg2 cells (fig. 5). our results indicate that,
under the culture conditions used, only
ppar· but not ppará protein could be detected. ppar· is also expressed in hepg2
cells cultured in fcs2 medium, indicating
that the decrease of apo ciii secretion by
these cells was not due to the loss of ppar·
expression.

discussion

regulation of apo ciii secretion plays a
major role in the control of triglyceride-rich
lipoprotein metabolism. hepg2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line widely used to study
hepatic function, are often used to study apolipoprotein gene regulation and in some cases
also apolipoprotein secretion. however, in

with anti-ppar antibodies. cellular extracts from
hepg2 cells cultured in fcs1 or fcs2 were prepared
as indicated in methods and submitted to sds-page
electrophoresis. after electrotransfer, the nitrocellulose membrane was incubated either with anti-ppar·
or with anti-ppará antibodies.

only a few publications apo ciii secretion was
also analyzed. in the present study we demonstrate that apo ciii secretion can be measured
in culture medium of hepg2 cells, but that its
secretion is inhibited by the use of certain
commercial calf serum batches. the mechanism by which the fetal calf serum regulates
apo ciii secretion is unclear at present. however, it does not appear to result in a general
abolition of apolipoprotein secretion. indeed
comparison with other apolipoproteins, such
apo ai, b, aii, and e, reveals that the choice
of the fcs used to grow the cells can affect the
secretion of all these apolipoproteins but that
only apo ciii secretion can be abolished. this
effect is a long-term and irreversible effect.
therefore, to study apo ciii secretion it is
important to carefully select the appropriate
fcs. interestingly these data indicate that
apo ciii secretion is under negative control of
a nonlipophilic serum factor and that this
effect can be dissociated from any effect on
apo b secretion. so, if these hypothetical factors play a role in vivo, selective impaired apo
ciii secretion may interfere with apolipoprotein composition of vldl and their catabolism. therefore, it will be of interest to determine the nature of this factor.
apo ciii is regulated at the transcriptional
level by a number of biological and pharma-

cological factors. gruber et al. [12] demonstrated its regulation in hepg2 cells by cytokines acting via a nfîb element. chen et al.
[13] reported that insulin treatment in diabetic mice and in hepg2 cells induced a dosedependent down-regulation of apo ciii transcriptional activity and they assumed that apo
ciii mrna levels reflect the synthesis and
secretion of the protein. different authors
demonstrated hnf-4 activation of apo ciii
transcription [42–45] and a complex interaction between different nuclear receptors modulates apo ciii transcription.

are largely used in humans. they have profound effects on triglyceride-rich lipoprotein
metabolism. vldl composition is modified
with slight decreases in apo b and apo e content and an important decrease in apo ciii.
these modifications in lipoprotein composition have a stimulatory effect on the catabolism of these lipoproteins which become better substrates for lpl [3] and ligands for the
 xxxg1318xxx  [10]. the hypotriglyceridemic
action of fibrates has been shown to be partly
due to a decrease of plasma apo ciii levels
which are the result of apo ciii gene transcription suppression mediated by ppar·
[17]. administration of the fibrate derivative
wy-14643 to wild-type mice resulted in a
marked decrease of hepatic apo ciii mrna
levels and serum triglyceride concentrations;
in contrast, ppar·-deficient mice were unaffected by wy-14643 treatment [18]. although
animal models are often used to study the
mechanisms of regulation of lipoproteins,
their lipid metabolism is very different compared to humans. so gene regulation and
secretion of apolipoproteins have to be tested
on human cells, before extrapolation of the
results obtained in animals can be made to
man. hertz et al. [17] used hepg2 cells to
extend the results obtained in rodents to humans but they only studied apo ciii mrna

levels and did not provide any information
with respect to apo ciii secretion. here we
demonstrate that apo ciii secretion does not
necessarily correlate with mrna levels when
analyzed under inappropriate culture conditions. previous studies from our laboratory
[20] have shown a decrease of apo ciii gene
expression and secretion by human primary
hepatocytes. however, human hepatocytes
cannot be routinely used for screening purposes. our results indicate that the human
hepg2 cell model can be a suitable system to
study apo ciii secretion when appropriate
culture conditions are used. however, apo
ciii secretion should be carefully monitored
before these experiments are performed.
in conditions where apo ciii is secreted,
inhibition of secretion can be obtained by
fenofibric acid and by other fibric acid derivatives, such as wy-14643. this inhibition is
due to a transcriptional inhibition. the lack of
effect of the thiazolidinedione ( xxxd3147xxx )
on hepg2 cells suggests that similar as in
rodents, in human hepatic cells, apo ciii
secretion is not regulated via ppará but via
ppar·. this hypothesis is strenghtened by
the presence of ppar· protein in hepg2 cell
extracts whereas ppará could not be detected.
