abstract
src family kinases (sfk) are currently being investigated as
targets for treatment strategies in various cancers. the novel
sfk/abl inhibitor,  xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx ), is a promising
therapeutic agent with oral bioavailability.  xxxd1815xxx  has been
shown to inhibit growth of bcr-abl–dependent chronic
myeloid leukemia xenografts in nude mice.  xxxd1815xxx  also
has been shown to have activity against cultured human
prostate and breast cancer cells. however, the molecular
mechanism by which  xxxd1815xxx  acts on epithelial tumor cells
remains unknown. in this study, we show that  xxxd1815xxx  blocks
the kinase activities of the sfks, lyn and src, in human
prostate cancer cells at low nanomolar concentrations.
moreover, focal adhesion kinase and crk-associated substrate
(p130cas) signaling downstream of sfks are also inhibited at
similar concentrations of  xxxd1815xxx . consistent with inhibition
of these signaling pathways,  xxxd1815xxx  suppresses cell adhesion, migration, and invasion of prostate cancer cells at low
nanomolar concentrations. therefore,  xxxd1815xxx  has potential
as a therapeutic agent for metastatic prostate cancers harboring activated sfk and focal adhesion kinase signaling.

introduction
elevated levels and activities of src family kinases (sfk),
including src and lyn, have been shown in numerous human
cancer cell lines and tumor tissues (1–3). sfks phosphorylate
tyrosyl residues of critical cellular substrates, resulting in the
activation of oncogenic signal transduction pathways (4, 5). one
such substrate of sfks, focal adhesion kinase (fak), has an
important role in integrin signaling (6) and is highly expressed in
many tumor cells including prostate cancer (7, 8). tyrosyl
phosphorylation of fak stimulates its ability to modulate cell
adhesion, migration, and invasion (6). in addition, tyrosyl
phosphorylation of crk-associated substrate (p130cas), another
substrate of sfks, is important for cell motility and invasion (9, 10).
originally,  xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx ) compound [ xxxd1815xxx ] was selected as a synthetic
small-molecule inhibitor of sfks (11). in addition,  xxxd1815xxx  was
subsequently found to be a bcr-abl kinase inhibitor, as has been
shown earlier for other sfk inhibitors (12, 13). furthermore, a

recent phase i clinical trial determined that  xxxd1815xxx  is a
promising agent for treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia
with activated bcr-abl kinase.  xxxd1815xxx  also showed activity
against epithelial tumor cells, including human prostate and breast
cancer cells (11). however, the molecular mechanisms of  xxxd1815xxx ’s
action on epithelial tumor cells remain unknown. here, we report
that  xxxd1815xxx  inhibits sfk/fak/p130cas signaling at low nanomolar concentrations, associated with inhibition of cell adhesion,
migration, and invasion of human prostate cancer cells.

materials and methods
cells and reagents. du-145 and lncap prostate cancer cells were
obtained from american type culture collection and cultured in rpmi
1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. polyclonal antibodies to the
phosphoproteins p-src (tyr416), p-fak (tyr576/577), p-p130cas (tyr410),
p-stat3 (tyr705), p- xxxg1369xxx /2 (thr202/tyr204), and p-akt (ser473) were
obtained from cell signaling technologies (cambridge, ma). polyclonal
antibodies to lyn, fak, and p130cas proteins were from santa cruz
biotechnology (santa cruz, ca). polyclonal antibodies to the phosphoprotein p-fak (tyr397 and tyr861) were from biosource international
(camarillo, ca). monoclonal antibody to  xxxg2198xxx  was obtained from
upstate biotechnology (lake placid, ny).  xxxd1815xxx  was obtained from
bristol-myers squibb pharmaceutical research institute (princeton, nj).
 xxxd1815xxx  was synthesized by the addition of methylpyrimidine to the
2-amino group of thiazole, followed by reaction with hydroxyethyl
piperazine (11).
lyn and src kinase assays in vitro. lyn and src kinase assays were
done in vitro as described in the supplier’s protocol (upstate biotechnology). twenty-microliter aliquots of each 25 al reaction mixture were
transferred onto the center of substrate-binding phosphocellulose paper
squares. assay squares were washed thrice with 0.75% phosphoric acid,
and transferred to vials with 5 ml of scintillation cocktail. after
quantifying activity with a ls6500 scintillation counter (beckman coulter,
fullerton, ca), radioactivity in assay squares was directly visualized by
autoradiography.
western blot analysis. western blot analysis was done as previously
described (14). primary phosphospecific antibodies were incubated in
tbs (ph 7.5) with 0.1% tween 20 and 5% bovine  xxxg124xxx  with
gentle agitation overnight at 4jc. horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
secondary antibodies were diluted in tbs or pbs with 5% nonfat
milk and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. positive immunoreactions were detected using the chemiluminescent substrate system
(pierce, rockford, il). for immunoprecipitation of lyn, cell lysates (300
ag) were incubated with lyn antibody overnight at 4jc, followed by
protein a/g-agarose for 1 hour at 4jc (pierce). samples were
immunoblotted with p-src family antibody (tyr416), which cross-reacts
with p-lyn (tyr396).
cell adhesion assay. cells (1  105/well) were pretreated with  xxxd1815xxx 
for 30 minutes and adhered onto fibronectin-coated 96-well plates (bd
sciences, san jose, ca) for 1 hour at 37jc. all procedures were done as
described previously (15). briefly, nonadhered cells were removed by
washing thrice with serum-free medium. attached cells were fixed with 70%

methanol for 10 minutes. cells were stained with 0.02% crystal violet in 0.2%
 xxxd102xxx  and dissolved with 100 al sorenson solution/well. plates
were analyzed with an automated elisa reader at 540 nm. each experiment
was done in triplicate.
wound healing assay for cell migration. monolayer wounds were
made using a pipette tip on confluent du-145 cells cultured in six-well
plates. cells were treated with  xxxd1815xxx  or dmso as vehicle control in a
dose-dependent manner and then allowed to migrate into the denuded area
for 6 hours. cell migration was visualized  xxxd1891xxx  magnification using a te
2000 inverted fluorescence microscope (nikon, melville, ny) and iplab 3.6
software (scanalytics, fairfax, va), and photographed with a retiga 1300
ccd camera (qimaging, burnaby, b.c., canada). distances of denuded
areas were measured as pixel units.
analysis of  xxxg1440xxx  activity.  xxxg1440xxx  ( xxxg1440xxx ) activity assays were done with a  xxxg1440xxx  human elisa
kit (amersham biosciences, piscataway, nj). cells were washed with pbs
twice and serum-free medium twice. fresh serum-free medium was added
to cell cultures and cells were exposed to  xxxd1815xxx  or dmso as vehicle
control for 24 hours. cell culture medium was collected and concentrated
using centrifugal ultra filters (millipore, billerica, ma). normalized
proteins (2 ag/well) were added to 96-well elisa plates. the reaction
was stopped with 100 al of 1 mol/l  xxxd3258xxx  and absorbance was
measured with an automated elisa plate reader at 450 nm. each
experiment was done in quadruplicate.
cell invasion assay. cell invasion assays were done on polycarbonate
membrane inserts (8 um pore size; chemicon international, temecula, ca).
du-145 cells were washed with pbs once and serum-free medium twice.
cells were resuspended with fresh serum-free medium and  xxxd1815xxx  or
dmso as vehicle control was added. cells (5  105/well) in 300 al of serumfree medium were placed over the inner chamber of the insert in a 24-well
tissue culture plate, and 500 al of serum-free medium was placed in the
outer chamber of the insert. the plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37jc.
after 24 hours, the cells that migrated through to the lower surface of the
extracellular matrix layer were stained and dissolved in 10% acetic acid.
solutions were transferred to a 96-well plate and absorbances measured
with an automated elisa plate reader at 540 nm. each experiment was
done in triplicate.
statistical analysis. descriptive statistics, such as mean values and
sd, were calculated for the biological effects of  xxxd1815xxx  (i.e., inhibition
of cell adhesion,  xxxg1440xxx  activity, and invasion) by dose levels (nmol/l).
to determine statistical significance between pair-wise dose levels, the
exact wilcoxon two-sample test was used, considering the small sample
sizes. one-sided tests at a significance level of 0.05 were examined. all
data were analyzed using the sas software (version 9.1, sas institute,
cary, nc).

results and discussion
 xxxd1815xxx  inhibits src family kinase activity in vitro and
in vivo. the human du-145 cell line is an androgen-independent,
highly aggressive metastatic prostate cancer cell line, whereas
the androgen-dependent human lncap prostate cancer cell line
exhibits relatively low aggressiveness and low metastatic potential
(16). a previous study reported that lyn is expressed in a majority
of primary human prostate cancers and thus might be a potential
target protein for treatment of this disease (17).  xxxd1815xxx  is a
thiazole- and pyrimidine-based sfk/abl kinase inhibitor (fig. 1a).
to confirm that  xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx ) directly inhibits lyn and
src kinase activity, in vitro kinase assays were done with active
recombinant lyn or src proteins.  xxxd1815xxx  showed an inhibitory
effect on both lyn and src kinase activities with ic50 values of 8.5
and 3.0 nmol/l, respectively (fig. 1b and c).
western blot analysis was used to evaluate total and autophosphorylated lyn and src protein levels in intact du-145 and lncap
cells. du-145 cells expressed higher levels of lyn than lncap cells,

showed a large decrease in p-lyn and p-src levels at 1 to 10 nmol/l
in du-145 cells (fig. 2b and d, bottom).
 xxxd1815xxx  selectively inhibits focal adhesion kinase and
p130cas signaling. fak is a nonreceptor  xxxg2198xxx  and
increased levels of expression and tyrosyl phosphorylation of fak
have been shown in epithelial tumors (8). in this signaling pathway,
the autophosphorylation of fak at tyr397 recruits sfks that
phosphorylate fak at tyr576, tyr577, and tyr861 (6). phosphorylation of these latter sites by sfks is important for fak downstream signaling (6). to assess whether  xxxd1815xxx  inhibits sfk/fak
signaling, du-145 and lncap cells were exposed to  xxxd1815xxx  for
6 hours.  xxxd1815xxx  almost totally abolished the levels of p-fak at
tyr576/577 in du-145 cells, whereas p-fak was not detected in
lncap cells (fig. 3a, top) even though both cell lines expressed

a and c, du-145 and lncap cells were treated with 100 nmol/l  xxxd1815xxx  for
6 hours. for p-lyn detection, lysates were immunoprecipitated with lyn antibody
and blotted with p-src family antibody (tyr416), which cross-reacts with
autophosphorylated p-lyn (tyr396). western blot analysis was also done with
specific antibodies to p-src and src. b and d, du-145 cells were treated
with 100 nmol/l  xxxd1815xxx  in a time-dependent manner (top ) or for 6 hours in a
dose-dependent manner (bottom ). western blot analysis was done as
described above. dmso was used as vehicle control for all experiments.

 xxxd1815xxx  in a time-dependent manner (top ) or for 6 hours in a dose-dependent

similar levels of total fak protein (fig. 3a, bottom). treatment with
100 nmol/l  xxxd1815xxx  for 24 hours had no effect on cell viability
and total cell numbers, although partial inhibition of cell
proliferation due to g1 arrest was observed at 48 and 72 hours
(data not shown). most strikingly, however, there was a substantial
loss of cell-to-cell contact in du-145 cells (fig. 3b). this effect
may be related to the decrease in levels of p-fak and p-p130cas
(see below).
a time course study showed that 100 nmol/l  xxxd1815xxx  reduced
the levels of p-fak at y576/577/861 in 30 minutes, whereas it did
not change levels of p-fak autophosphorylation at tyr397 (fig. 3c,
top). a dose-dependent study also showed that cells treated with
 xxxd1815xxx  for 6 hours exhibited decreased the levels of p-fak at
tyr576/577/861 at 1 to 10 nmol/l, whereas the levels of p-fak
autophosphorylation at tyr397 did not change (fig. 3c, bottom).
the reduced levels of p-fak at tyr576/577/861 correlated with
a decrease in the levels of p-lyn and p-src (compare with fig. 2b
and d), suggesting that  xxxd1815xxx  targets sfk/fak signaling.
however,  xxxd1815xxx  does not directly inhibit fak autophosphorylation at tyr397 in du-145 cells, consistent with a previous report
that  xxxd1815xxx  did not inhibit fak activity in an in vitro kinase
assay (11).
next, we examined whether  xxxd1815xxx  could reduce the
phosphorylation levels of proteins involved in other  xxxg2198xxx 
signaling pathways. levels of p-stat3, p- xxxg1369xxx /2, and p-akt were not
altered with  xxxd1815xxx  treatment (fig. 3d). notably,  xxxd1815xxx  does
not induce apoptosis in du-145 cells (data not shown), consistent
with the lack of effect on levels of p-akt and p-stat3, both signaling
proteins that are involved in tumor cell survival (18). thus, our
observations suggest that  xxxd1815xxx  predominantly acts by inhibiting sfk/fak signaling in prostate cancer cells.
the p130cas protein is involved in integrin-mediated cell
signaling and its sh3 domain interacts with fak to form a fakp130 complex (6, 9). tyrosyl phosphorylation of fak at tyr861
regulates its interaction with p130cas (19) and tyrosyl phosphorylation of p130cas is involved in cell motility and invasion (9, 10, 20).
to determine whether inhibition of sfks by  xxxd1815xxx  reduces levels
of p-p130cas, du-145 cells were exposed to  xxxd1815xxx  for time
course and dose-dependent studies. consistent with the inhibition

(n = 3). b,  xxxd1815xxx  inhibits cell migration. wound healing assay was done to
determine whether  xxxd1815xxx  inhibits cell migration. after treatment with various
 xxxd1815xxx  concentrations for 6 hours, cells were allowed to migrate into the
denuded area for 6 hours. cell migration was visualized  xxxd1891xxx  magnification by
light microscopy, and photographed with a digital camera. width of denuded
areas versus  xxxd1815xxx  concentration was plotted in pixels (bottom graph ).
c,  xxxd1815xxx  inhibits  xxxg1440xxx  activity. du-145 cells were washed with 1 pbs
twice and serum-free medium twice. fresh serum-free medium was added to
plates and cells were exposed to  xxxd1815xxx  for 24 hours. culture medium was
collected and concentrated with an ultra-centrifugal filter device. normalized
proteins were added to 96-well elisa plates. reactions were stopped with
100 al of 1 mol/l  xxxd3258xxx  and absorbances read with an automated elisa

d,  xxxd1815xxx  inhibits cell invasion. du145 cells in 300 al of serum-free medium
were placed over the inner chamber of the insert in a 24-well tissue culture
plate, and 500 al of serum-free medium was placed in the outer chamber of the
insert. the plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37jc and 5% co2 atmosphere.
after 24 hours, the invasive cells that migrated through the lower surface of
the extracellular matrix layer were stained. the stained cells were dissolved in
10% acetic acid and absorbance was read with an automated elisa reader
at 540 nm. each experiment was done in triplicate. columns, mean; bars, f sd;

of p-fak levels (fig. 3c),  xxxd1815xxx  decreased p-p130cas levels,
whereas total levels of p130cas were unaltered (fig. 3e). the
observed reduction of p-p130cas levels also correlates well with the
reduction of p-lyn and p-src levels (fig. 2b and d).
 xxxd1815xxx  inhibits cell adhesion, migration, and invasion.
fak has an important role in the integrin signaling cascade (6).
cellular adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins such as
fibronectin require integrins. to assess whether  xxxd1815xxx  blocks
cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, du-145 cells were
pretreated with the drug for 30 minutes to inhibit levels of
p-fak and p-p130cas. cell adhesion to fibronectin was significantly
inhibited by 10 nmol/l of  xxxd1815xxx  (fig. 4a). this finding
correlates with the observed reduction of p-fak and p-p130cas
(fig. 3c and e), suggesting that the effects of  xxxd1815xxx  on p-fak
and p-p130cas levels contribute to inhibition of cell adhesion to
fibronectin. in addition, wound-healing assays were done to
determine whether  xxxd1815xxx  affects cell migration.  xxxd1815xxx 
inhibited cell migration at 1 to 10 nmol/l after 6 hours of
treatment (fig. 4b). these findings indicate that the reduction of
p-fak and p-p130cas levels by  xxxd1815xxx  is associated with
inhibition of cell adhesion and migration.
a previous study showed that the inhibition of fak reduced
 xxxg1440xxx  secretion (7). to determine whether down-regulation of
p-fak by  xxxd1815xxx  contributes to inhibition of  xxxg1440xxx  activity,
a  xxxg1440xxx  activity assay was done with proteins secreted by cells
treated with  xxxd1815xxx  for 24 hours. as shown in fig. 4c,
 xxxd1815xxx  significantly inhibited secretion of  xxxg1440xxx  activity at
1 to 10 nmol/l. to assess whether inhibition of  xxxg1440xxx  activity
correlates with inhibition of cell invasion, du-145 cells pretreated
with  xxxd1815xxx  for 30 minutes were added onto the extracellular
matrix layer of the assay chamber for 24 hours.  xxxd1815xxx

therapeutic implications.  xxxd1815xxx  is an orally bioavailable
and promising antitumor therapeutic agent for chronic myelogenous leukemia (11, 13). recently, phase i clinical trials showed
the efficacy of  xxxd1815xxx  for the treatment of chronic myelogenous
leukemia with activated bcr-abl kinase.5 in addition,  xxxd1815xxx  has
been advanced into clinical trials for human epithelial solid
tumors.5 many invasive epithelial tumors exhibit elevated sfk and
fak expression levels and activities (1–6). in this report, we show
that  xxxd1815xxx  blocks sfk/fak/p130cas signaling, resulting in
inhibition of cell adhesion, migration, and invasion in prostate
cancer cells. based on this action of  xxxd1815xxx  on prostate cancer
cells, we suggest that  xxxd1815xxx  has potential as an antitumor
therapeutic agent in metastatic prostate cancers harboring
activated sfk and fak signaling.
