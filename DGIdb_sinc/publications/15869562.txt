abstract
the siberian hamster provides a physiological model for understanding the hypothalamic control of energy
metabolism as it undergoes annual photoperiod-regulated cycles of body weight (i.e. fattening in summer,
and catabolism of fat stores in winter). as a first step to investigate whether enhanced serotonergic (5-ht)
tone might underlie the catabolic processes in short days, we investigated whether serotonergic stimulation
can produce catabolic actions in fat hamsters housed in long days. acute treatment with the serotonin
reuptake inhibitor (+/–) fenfluramine (8 mg/kg, i.p.) produced a prolonged, dose-dependent reduction in
food intake in both photoperiods. behavioural observations and radiotelemetry analyses revealed that this
anorectic effect of fenfluramine was associated with short-term increases in locomotor activity and in core
body temperature. in a subsequent series of studies, hamsters were pretreated with the  xxxg1115xxx 
antagonist sb242084 (4 mg/kg, i.p.). this  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist completely blocked the anorectic
actions of fenfluramine, but did not decrease the hyperthermia or hyperlocomotion induced by fenfluramine; thus, the anorectic actions of fenfluramine probably reflect actions via the  xxxg1115xxx .
consistent with these observations, treatment of hamsters with the  xxxg1115xxx  agonist ver 3323
(10 mg/kg, i.p.) or the 5-ht1b/2c receptor agonist mcpp (3 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced food intake. the response
to manipulation of serotonergic pathways was not affected by the ambient photoperiod in any of these
studies. we conclude that the anorectic actions of fenfluramine are not an indirect consequence of serotonergic actions on arousal pathways, and that its actions on feeding in the siberian hamster are most likely
to be mediated by the  xxxg1115xxx .

the health-related and economic costs of the increasing
incidence of obesity in adolescents and adults are widely
recognized (1), yet few therapeutic approaches are available
to promote or maintain weight loss (2). from a neuroendocrine perspective, obesity reﬂects a shift in the hypothalamic
regulation of energy regulation such that caloric intake
exceeds energy expenditure, resulting in deposition of energy
stores in adipose tissue (3). currently, only one therapeutic
agent (sibutramine) is prescribed that can target the central
nervous system, acting to block reuptake and thereby increase
availability of serotonin and noradrenaline (4). a role for
ascending serotonin pathways in the control of appetite has
long been established (5, 6). in rodents, administration of
serotonin (5-ht, 5-hydroxytryptamine) or its precursors,
tryptophan and 5-hydrotryptophan, reduces food intake,
eating rate and meal size. similarly, some drugs increase
synaptic 5-ht levels, such as d-fenﬂuramine, which enhances
the release of 5-ht from nerve terminals and inhibits its
reuptake into neurones (7), reduces food intake and has been

marketed for the treatment of obesity (4). conversely, drugs
that inhibit the synthesis of 5-ht, block 5-ht receptors or
cause neurotoxic lesion of serotonergic neurones generally
increase food intake (8).
understanding the sites and precise mechanisms of action
of 5-ht in regulating energy balance is clearly important to
the development of speciﬁc and efﬁcacious drugs for helping
promote weight loss. a recent study in rats showed that the
decrease in food intake produced by treatment with d-fenﬂuramine is associated with activation of the melanocortin
pathway originating in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (9). the aim of the present study was to investigate the
role of the serotonergic system in the regulation of energy
balance in the siberian hamster (phodopus sungorus) because
this species shows profound annual cycles of weight gain and
loss, and increasingly is being used as a physiological rodent
model in which to understand the hypothalamic control of
long-term changes in energy balance (10–13). in long springsummer photoperiods (lp), the siberian hamster gains its

5-ht2c receptors in the regulation of food intake 277
maximum body weight but, in decreasing or short photoperiods (sp), it enters a winter catabolic state and gradually
loses up to 40% of its body weight (14–16), mainly through a
reduction in intraperitoneal fat stores (17). this decrease in
body weight in sp occurs even if hamsters are given food
ad libitum in laboratory experimental conditions (18), and is
associated with a decrease in food intake despite the fall in
peripheral leptin concentrations. thus, the hamster does not
engage in compensatory hyperphagia in the face of decreasing
fat reserves and a low leptin signal. it is not known whether
an increase in serotonergic tone or changes in peptidergic
pathways regulated by serotonin might underlie the development of this winter catabolic state. as a ﬁrst step towards
determining whether changes in serotonergic mechanisms
might contribute to weight loss and reduced food intake in
hamsters in winter, we investigated whether acute manipulation of serotonin aﬀects food intake and some aspects of
energy expenditure in this species, and evaluated which
receptor subtypes might underlie such actions. we ﬁrst tested
whether administration of the 5-ht reuptake inhibitor
fenﬂuramine would decrease food intake and inﬂuence
behaviour and temperature in hamsters, and then investigated
whether the suppression of food intake by fenﬂuramine
diﬀered between fat (lp) and lean (sp) hamsters. we
predicted that, if increased activity of the endogenous
serotonergic system contributes to the generation and maintenance of the catabolic state in sp, then there would be a
diminished response to fenﬂuramine in sp. second, we
investigated whether the hypophagic and behavioural eﬀects
of fenﬂuramine are mediated by the  xxxg1115xxx , because
5-ht2c knockout mice show a reduced hypophagic response
to fenﬂuramine (19). two approaches were adopted. the ﬁrst
investigated whether pretreatment with the  xxxg1115xxx 
antagonist sb242084 would block the subsequent effects of
fenﬂuramine. studies in food-deprived rats have shown that
d-fenﬂuramine-induced hypophagia is prevented by pretreatment with selective 5-ht2c antagonists, including sb242084
(20). the second approach was to determine whether agonists
with high aﬃnity for the  xxxg1115xxx  could mimic the
actions of fenﬂuramine by using the 5-ht1b/2c receptor
agonist 1-(m-chlorophenyl) piperazine (mcpp) (21), and a
novel compound with greater binding selectivity for the
 xxxg1115xxx  over non 5-ht2 receptors (ver 3323) (22).
materials and methods
animals and housing
a colony of siberian hamsters (phodopus sungorus) was maintained in a
temperature controlled room (21±1 c) on a 16 : 8 h light/dark cycle (lp;
lights on 20.00 h) with red light (approximately 10 lux) during the dark
period. at a minimum age of 8 weeks, female siberian hamsters weighing 35–
45 g were separated into single transparent cages and kept individually during
all experimental treatments. one group of hamsters was maintained in lp and
a second group of hamsters was transferred to a short photoperiodic room on
a 8 : 16 h light/dark cycle (sp; lights on 04.00 h) with red light (approximately
10 lux) during the dark period. laboratory chow and water were provided ad
libitum until the start of each experiment. all animal procedures were
approved by the university of nottingham local ethical review committee
and were carried out in accordance with the animals scientiﬁc procedures act
(uk) 1986 (project licence ppl 40/2372). lasa guidelines were followed for
administration of substances (23).

food intake measures (h)

fig. 1. experimental protocol. siberian hamsters were treated with drug or
vehicle just before the beginning of the dark phase. each hamster was observed under dim red light for 1 h after treatment. food intake was measured 2, 4, 6 and 24 h after treatment.
measurement of food intake
studies were conducted at the start of the dark phase when the circadian cycle
of the hamsters would dictate a hungry state (fig. 1). food intake was
measured exactly as described previously (11, 12). brieﬂy, immediately before
drug injection, the used sawdust was replaced in each cage to eliminate any
food hoards but paper bedding was retained to reduce novelty induced-stress.
laboratory chow was removed from the hopper, and a test meal consisting of
moist laboratory chow was placed in a preweighed dish in the home cage. the
dishes were then collected and weighed at 2-h intervals (fig. 1). after 6 h, a
fresh test meal was provided and this was weighed 18 h later (fig. 1). to
estimate the reduction in weight of the test meal through water evaporation,
four preweighed dishes also containing wet pellets were placed in control cages
alongside the experimental hamster cages. the calculation of the amount of
food taken by each hamster included the deduction of the mean evaporation
of water of the four controls.
behavioural scores
on the experimental day, under red light of approximately 10 lux at cage level,
each hamster was observed in its home cage for 5 s in every 1 min for 1 h after
lights off (fig. 1), as previously described (11, 12). each behaviour was scored
as being present or absent in the 5-s period and recorded. five behavioural
categories, based on (6), were used in this study: (i) feeding (biting, gnawing or
swallowing food from wet mash dish); (ii) drinking (licking the water bottle
spout); (iii) activity (locomotion, sniﬃng and rearing); (iv) grooming
(scratching, licking or biting of the fur, whiskers, feet or genitals); and (v)
resting (sitting or lying in a relaxed position).
measurement of temperature and activity
temperature and activity were measured using ta10ta-f20 radiotelemetry
implants, rpc-1 receivers and artv2.1 software (all datascience international, st paul, mn, usa), which allowed constant recording of these two
variables. telemetry devices were implanted surgically into the peritoneal
cavity of siberian hamsters under general anaesthesia. following surgery,
hamsters were individually housed and allowed to recover and acclimatize to
the room for 3 weeks before experimentation. cages were placed on telemetry
receivers, and temperature and activity was sampled for 10 s every 2 min. in
subsequent analysis and for presentation of data, mean temperature values
were calculated for 60-min time bins before and after treatment. because the
distribution of activity counts in these 10-s samples were not normally
distributed, subsequent analyses and presentation of data used median activity
values occurring in the corresponding 60-min bins.
drugs
(+/–) fenﬂuramine, sb242084 and mcpp were purchased from sigma (st
louis, mo, usa) and ver 3323 was a gift from vernalis (winnersh, uk).
all drugs were dissolved in 0.9% saline just before use. intraperitoneal (i.p.)
injections (10 ll/g body weight) were given to hamsters in their home room
before the beginning of the dark phase (fig. 1). hamsters received one
injection per week and the treatments were administered in random order.
only data from hamsters that received all doses were included in the statistical
analyses.

effects of  xxxg1115xxx  agonists on food intake, behaviour
and body temperature
hamsters maintained in lp (n ¼ 9) or in sp (n ¼ 8) for a minimum of
8 weeks were treated with vehicle or mcpp (0.3 and 3 mg/kg) in pseudorandom order. food intake and behaviour were studied in all these animals. the
mean body weight (± sem) at the beginning of the series of trials of hamsters
in lp was 44.9 ± 0.9 g compared to 37.4 ± 1.4 g for hamsters in sp. a
separate group of hamsters maintained in lp (n ¼ 9) was similarly treated
with vehicle or ver 3323 (3 and 10 mg/kg) in pseudorandom order, and food
intake and behaviour measured. temperature and locomotor activity were
studied by radiotelemetry in further groups of hamsters maintained in lp
after treatment with (i) vehicle or mcpp (0.3 and 3 mg/kg; n ¼ 7) or (ii)
vehicle or ver 3323 (10 mg/kg; n ¼ 6).
statistical analysis
two-factor analysis of variance (anova) with repeated measures (statview,
calabas, ca, usa) was used initially to determine the effects of photoperiod,
drug treatment and the interaction between photoperiod and drug-treatment
on the experimental endpoints. subsequently, within each photoperiod, drugtreated groups were compared with the vehicle group using a one-factor
anova with repeated measures followed by a dunnett’s procedure for posthoc comparisons (prism 2.01, graphpad software, san diego, ca, usa).
data are presented as group mean ± sem. p < 0.05 was considered
statistically signiﬁcant.

(effect of photoperiod: p < 0.01) (fig. 2, top and bottom). a
signiﬁcant interaction between photoperiod and dose of
fenﬂuramine (p < 0.01) was only detected 2–4 h after treatment; thus, overall photoperiod had no effect on the ability of
the high dose of fenﬂuramine to suppress food intake within
the immediate 6 h after treatment.
behavioural scores (fig. 3)
behavioural observations were carried out over the ﬁrst hour
after treatment with fenﬂuramine. two-factor anova of
behavioural scores following vehicle treatment revealed a
signiﬁcant interaction between photoperiod and treatment on
the proportion of time spent active and resting (p < 0.01);
thus, hamsters in lp were more active at the start of the dark
period than hamsters in sp. the highest dose of fenﬂuramine
(8 mg/kg) which was observed to inhibit gross food intake
(fig. 2) was not observed to decrease the proportion of time
spent investigating food (fig. 3, top). this dose of fenﬂuramine did signiﬁcantly increase the proportion of time spent
active (p < 0.01) in hamsters in both lp and sp. in hamsters
in sp (fig. 3, right), fenﬂuramine correspondingly decreased,

receptor antagonist sb242084, such that food intake after
treatment with sb242084 + fenﬂuramine was not signiﬁcantly different from that following vehicle alone during the
initial 4 h (fig. 4, top and bottom) and 4–6 h after the
injections (data not shown). treatment with sb242084 alone
(i.e. sb242084 + vehicle) had no eﬀect on food intake during
the initial 4 h after treatment in hamsters in either lp or sp
(fig. 4 top and bottom), nor did it aﬀect food intake at later
time points (data not shown). anova revealed no signiﬁcant
effect of photoperiod on food intake over the ﬁrst 2 h when
food intake after vehicle-only treatment in hamsters in lp
was compared to that in hamsters in sp, but a signiﬁcant
effect of photoperiod on food intake 2–4 h (p < 0.01, fig. 4)
and 4–6 h (p < 0.05, not shown) after treatment was
observed when comparing the vehicle–only treatment periods.
thus, overall food intake was lower in hamsters in sp
compared with those in lp, but this did not affect the ability
of fenﬂuramine to inhibit food intake, nor did it affect the
ability of pretreatment with sb242084 to antagonize the
action of fenﬂuramine.

the telemetry studies revealed that fenﬂuramine signiﬁcantly

in hamsters in lp (fig. 8, left panels), mcpp did not aﬀect
the proportion of time spent at the food source, but both
doses of mcpp (0.3 and 3 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly decreased the
proportion of time spent active and grooming during the ﬁrst
hour after treatment (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01). correspondingly, the highest dose of mcpp (3 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly
increased the proportion of time spent resting (p < 0.01). in
hamsters in sp (fig. 8, middle panels), the highest dose of
mcpp (3 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly increased the proportion of
time spent feeding and reduced the proportion of time spent
active and grooming (p < 0.05). two-factor anova revealed
a signiﬁcant effect of photoperiod (p < 0.01) on the proportion of time spent grooming and resting. there was also a
signiﬁcant interaction between photoperiod and dose of
mcpp on the proportion of time spent active (p < 0.01),
grooming (p < 0.05) and resting (p < 0.01). thus, as seen
previously (fig. 3), hamsters in lp were more active and
groomed more at the start of the dark period than hamsters in
sp, and correspondingly spent less time resting. mcpp
increased the proportion of time spent resting in hamsters
in lp (p < 0.01), but had no signiﬁcant effect in hamsters in
sp (fig. 8). in the ﬁrst hour after treatment in lp (fig. 8,
right), ver 3323 (10 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly decreased the
proportion of time spent feeding (p < 0.05), but did not
signiﬁcantly affect any other behavioural parameter. no
drinking behaviour was observed after any of the vehicle or
drug treatments.
activity and temperature (fig. 9)
treatment of hamsters in lp with mcpp caused a signiﬁcant
and dose-dependent decrease in both body temperature
(fig. 9, top left) and locomotor activity (fig. 9, bottom left)
1–2 h after the start of treatment. suppression of body
temperature was maintained by the highest dose of mcpp 2–
3 h after the injections (fig. 9, top left). in marked contrast to
the eﬀects of mcpp, treatment with ver 3323 (10 mg/kg)
had no eﬀect on body temperature (fig. 9, top right) or
activity (fig. 9, bottom right).

laboratory rodents in which fenﬂuramine has been shown to
reduce food intake (24–26). the decrease of food intake in the
siberian hamster was signiﬁcant within the ﬁrst 2 h after
intraperitoneal injection of 8 mg/kg of fenﬂuramine, demonstrating a rapid onset of action of the drug, and this eﬀect
lasted for at least 6 h. in mice, hypophagic eﬀects were
observed after injection of 3 mg/kg of fenﬂuramine (27) and
similarly in rats after treatment with 10 mg/kg of fenﬂuramine (28). because the compound we used was (+/–) fenﬂuramine and only one isomer of the compound is active, this
represents an actual dose of 4 mg/kg fenﬂuramine. the
subsequent increase of food intake observed in both photoperiods 6–24 h after the administration of fenﬂuramine
probably reﬂects a hyperphagic compensatory mechanism.

in general, the feeding response to fenﬂuramine was similar in
fat hamsters in lp and in lean hamsters in sp, despite the fact
that food intake in hamsters in sp was lower (as expected)
than in those in lp for the majority of the experimental
period.
in two of the studies, fenﬂuramine signiﬁcantly reduced the
proportion of time that hamsters were observed to be feeding
or investigating the food source but, in the two other studies,
there was only a trend towards decreased feeding behaviour.
our interpretation would be that the drug reduces both meal
frequency (studies in which a signiﬁcant decrease in feeding
behaviour was observed) and meal size (decrease in food
consumption). in all studies, an increase in locomotor activity
occurred following 8 mg/kg fenﬂuramine, whether measured

by observation or indirectly by radiotelemetry (table 1).
however, it is clear that the hypophagia induced by fenﬂuramine is not a consequence of the increased activity per se,
because pretreatment with sb242084 completely abolished
the hypophagic response yet potentiated the hyperlocomotor
response.
to test whether the hypophagic and behavioural effects of
fenﬂuramine are mediated by 5-ht2c receptors in siberian
hamsters, its effects were determined after pretreatment with
the selective  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist sb242084. this
antagonist completely blocked the decrease in food intake
induced by fenﬂuramine in hamsters in both photoperiods
(table 1). assuming that sb242084 has a similar 5-ht2c
selectivity in siberian hamsters as in other species, this
observation is consistent with the view that stimulation of
5-ht2c receptors is the principal consequence of fenﬂuramine

action underlying hypophagia (29). indeed, similar studies in
food deprived rats have also shown that d-fenﬂuramineinduced hypophagia is prevented by pretreatment with
selective 5-ht2c antagonists, including sb242084 (20). furthermore, 5-ht2c knockout mice show a reduced hypophagic
response to fenﬂuramine (19) suggesting that fenﬂuramine
has a common mechanism of action on feeding, at least in
rodents. conversely, the hyperactivity and hyperthermia
induced by fenﬂuramine was not attenuated by sb242084
(table 1). therefore, these actions of fenﬂuramine appear to
be mediated via non5-ht2c receptor mechanisms.
to investigate further the involvement of the 5-ht2c
receptor in the regulation of food intake in siberian hamsters,
the effects of the 5-ht1b/2c receptor agonist mcpp (21) and
also ver 3323, which has a greater binding selectivity for the
5-ht2c over non5-ht2 receptors (22), were examined. interpretation of our observations does rest upon the assumption
that mcpp and ver 3323 are, respectively, selective 5-ht1b/
2c and  xxxg1115xxx  agonists in siberian hamsters. both
agonists signiﬁcantly reduced food intake (table 1), although
the duration of action was shorter than that of fenﬂuramine,
lasting for only the ﬁrst 2 h after drug administration. ver
3323 had no eﬀect on body temperature or motor activity
(table 1), whereas mcpp signiﬁcantly decreased motor activity, grooming behaviour and body temperature (table 1).
these results show a clear involvement of the  xxxg1115xxx 
in the regulation of food intake in siberian hamsters because
both drugs reduced feeding, but it appears likely that the
hypothermia and hypolocomotion induced by mcpp may at
least in part involve alternative actions, possibly via the 5-ht1b
receptor for which ver 3323 has a much lower afﬁnity (22).
the observation that the agonist mcpp had an opposite eﬀect
on activity and temperature to the 5-ht reuptake inhibitor
fenﬂuramine, yet both reduced food intake (table 1), supports
the argument that hypophagia induced by manipulation of
serotonergic activity does represent a speciﬁc eﬀect on satiety
rather than a nonspeciﬁc consequence of the induction of
incompatible behaviours.
our results support and extend those from other species
indicating that the principal 5-ht receptors involved in
appetite regulation are the 5-ht2c and 5-ht1b receptors (6).
mcpp reduces food intake in humans (30), rats (31, 32) and
mice (27), and the hypophagic eﬀect induced by mcpp in the
rat can be attenuated by pretreatment with either 5-ht2c or
 xxxg1109xxx  antagonists (31). moreover  xxxg1115xxx -knockout mice are hyperphagic, obese and do not show a
hypophagic response to mcpp or d-fenﬂuramine (19, 33).
the current observations integrate well with our recent
studies on the peptidergic control of feeding behaviour in the
hamster (11, 12, 34). stimulation of melanocortin receptors
profoundly suppresses food intake in the siberian hamster
(11, 12). heisler et al. (9) demonstrated that, in rats,
fenﬂuramine stimulates the release of 5-ht in the arcuate
nucleus and activates pomc neurones (i.e. induced c-fos
expression), and so mcpp, ver 3323 and fenﬂuramine may
act on the 5-ht2c receptors expressed in pomc neurones in
the arcuate nucleus, resulting in activation of the melanocortin system. similarly, trh also induces hypophagia in
siberian hamsters (34). the innervation of central trhcontaining systems by serotonergic ﬁbres has been long

 2005 blackwell publishing ltd, journal of neuroendocrinology, 17, 276–285

284 5-ht2c receptors in the regulation of food intake
established, at least in the rat (35), and lesions of serotonin
neurones with 5, 7-dihydroxytryptamine or blockade of 5-ht
synthesis with p-chlorophenylalanine both decrease trh
levels in the rat brain (36). however, the overall goal of our
studies is to identify central catabolic systems that might be
preferentially active in short days and thereby generate the
seasonal state of hypophagia and weight (fat) loss. there was
no clear diﬀerence in the response to either mcpp or
fenﬂuramine between the hamsters in lp and those in sp,
despite a clear reduction in body weight in hamsters in short
photoperiod at the start of each series of studies, and also
some decreases in voluntary food intake when compared after
vehicle treatment. this outcome is also consistent with the
failure to detect diﬀerences in response to trh (34), or to
melanocortin agonists (11) or antagonists (12), in hamsters in
the lp versus sp state. our attention is now focused upon
addressing the function of systems where there is evidence for
photoperiod-induced diﬀerential gene expression within the
hypothalamus, in particular, the histaminergic system where
the h3 receptor is down-regulated in the short-day catabolic
state (37), and the retinoid signalling system where genes
encoding several  xxxd3417xxx  transporters/nuclear receptors
are similarly down-regulated (38).
in conclusion, our ﬁndings show that the 5-ht reuptake
inhibitor fenﬂuramine exerts a potent hypophagic effect,
demonstrating the involvement of the serotonergic system in
the regulation of food intake in both fat and lean siberian
hamsters. we have demonstrated the involvement of 5-ht2c
receptors in the regulation of feeding in the hamster by showing
that the  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist sb242084 was able to
block the decrease of food intake induced by fenﬂuramine in
both photoperiods. however, sb242084 was unable to block
the increased locomotor activity and hyperthermia induced by
fenﬂuramine, suggesting that these behavioural and physiological effects of fenﬂuramine are not mediated via 5-ht2c
receptors, and do not underlie the hypophagia induced by this
compound. the involvement of 5-ht2c receptors in the
regulation of food intake is supported by the observations
that the  xxxg1115xxx  agonist ver 3323 and the 5-ht1b/2c
receptor agonist mcpp decreased food intake in hamsters in
both photoperiods. however, these acute studies do not
provide evidence that differential activity of the 5-ht2c/
serotonergic system underlies the seasonal decrease in food
intake that contributes to the long-term catabolic state in
hamsters maintained in short photoperiod.
