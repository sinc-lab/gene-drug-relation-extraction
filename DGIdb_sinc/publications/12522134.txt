 xxxd2715xxx  has been used in the treatment of dyslipidemia
for many years, producing a very desirable modification of
multiple cardiovascular risk factors, increasing high density
lipoprotein, and decreasing very low density lipoprotein, low
density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and lipoprotein (a), which
results in a reduction in mortality (1). despite its long history
of clinical use, the precise mechanism of action of  xxxd2715xxx

lipolysis via the activation of a gi-coupled receptor may contribute (2– 4). it has been postulated that a reduction in free
 xxxd2154xxx  liberated from adipose tissue results in a reduction
of hepatic triglycerides available for very low density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein synthesis, which in part explains the hypolipidemic effects observed during  xxxd2715xxx 
therapy. because the identification of a molecular target for
 xxxd2715xxx  would facilitate our understanding of its mode of
action and potentially enable the discovery of superior drug
molecules, we instigated a strategy to identify this receptor. to
identify the gi-g protein-coupled receptor for  xxxd2715xxx ,
orphan receptors were selected based on their tissue expression
profiles for a rational screening exercise. recently, the pharmacological sites of action of  xxxd2715xxx  were shown to be
largely restricted to adipose tissue and spleen (5). therefore, to
identify this  xxxg1026xxx , we selected a subset of 10
orphan g protein-coupled receptors, which by mrna distribution analysis (taqman) exhibited significant expression levels
in both adipose tissue and spleen. these receptors were then
expressed in an appropriate mammalian cell line to allow
measurement of a functional response (gtp␥s1 binding) following  xxxd2715xxx  treatment. this paper describes the identification of  xxxg1027xxx  as a low affinity receptor for  xxxd2715xxx 
and the subsequent indication of  xxxg1026xxx , a high affinity receptor for  xxxd2715xxx . the identification of  xxxg1026xxx  has allowed
us to test additional compounds that have been reported to
possess a similar pharmacology to  xxxd2715xxx .
experimental procedures

materials— xxxd2715xxx , nicotinuric acid, and nicotinamide were
obtained from sigma-aldrich, 5-methyl  xxxd2715xxx  was from maybridge, and pyridine-3-acetic acid was from icn. lipofectamine, dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium, and fetal calf serum were from invitrogen. [35s]gtp␥s (1160 ci/mmol) and [5,6-3h] xxxd2715xxx  (50 – 60
ci/mmol) were purchased from amersham biosciences and biotrend,
respectively. pertussis toxin was from sigma-aldrich. acipimox, acifran, and 5-methyl  xxxd3045xxx -3-carboxylic acid were synthesized by chemists within glaxosmithkline.
molecular biology—the  xxxg1027xxx  expressed sequence tag was identified from the public data base as a potential seven transmembranespanning receptor, and the predicted open reading frame was amplified
using human placenta cdna as template. comparison of the nucleotide
sequence of  xxxg1027xxx  with that of the published sequence revealed 15
nucleotide differences as well as a 5-nucleotide insertion at the 3⬘ end of

 xxxd2715xxx  has been used clinically for over 40
years in the treatment of dyslipidemia producing a desirable normalization of a range of cardiovascular risk
factors, including a marked elevation of high density
lipoprotein and a reduction in mortality. the precise
mechanism of action of  xxxd2715xxx  is unknown, although it is believed that activation of a gi-g proteincoupled receptor may contribute. utilizing available information on the tissue distribution of  xxxd2715xxx 
receptors, we identified candidate orphan receptors.
the selected orphan receptors were screened for responses to  xxxd2715xxx , in an assay for activation of
gi-g proteins. here we describe the identification of the
g protein-coupled receptor  xxxg1027xxx  as a low affinity receptor for  xxxd2715xxx . we then describe the subsequent identification of  xxxg1026xxx  in follow-up bioinformatics searches and demonstrate that it acts as a high
affinity receptor for  xxxd2715xxx  and other compounds
with related pharmacology. the discovery of  xxxg1026xxx 
as a molecular target for  xxxd2715xxx  may facilitate
the discovery of superior drug molecules to treat
dyslipidemia.

identification of receptors for  xxxd2715xxx 
buffer containing 1 mm mgcl2 in a total volume of 500 ␮l. nonspecific
binding was assessed in the presence of 1 mm  xxxd2715xxx . membranebound ligand was recovered onto presoaked gf/b filters using a brandel 48-well harvester, washed four times with 1 ml of ice-cold binding
buffer, and measured by liquid scintillation counting. [3h] xxxd2715xxx 
(20 nm) displacement assays were performed using plasma membranecontaining p2 particulate fractions, prepared from either a stable cho
cell line expressing recombinant human  xxxg1026xxx  or human adipocytes
(zen-bio) as described (5) and above.
[35s]gtp␥s binding—[35s]gtp␥s binding assays were performed at
room temperature in 96-well format as described previously (7). briefly,
the membranes (10 ␮g/point) were diluted to 0.083 mg/ml in assay
buffer (20 mm hepes, 100 mm nacl, 10 mm mgcl2, ph 7.4) supplemented with saponin (10 mg/l) and preincubated with 10 ␮m gdp.
various concentrations of  xxxd2715xxx  or related molecules were
added, followed by [35s]gtp␥s (1170 ci/mmol; amersham biosciences)
at 0.3 nm (total volume of 100 ␮l), and binding was allowed to proceed
at room temperature for 30 min. nonspecific binding was determined by
the inclusion of 0.6 mm gtp. wheat germ agglutinin spa beads (amersham biosciences) (0.5 mg) in 25 ␮l of assay buffer were added, and
the whole was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with agitation.
the plates were centrifuged at 1500 ⫻ g for 5 min, and bound
[35s]gtp␥s was determined by scintillation counting on a wallac 1450
microbeta trilux scintillation counter.
oocyte methods—capped crna (20 –50 ng/oocyte) was injected into
stage v–vi defolliculated oocytes (8), and two microelectrode voltage
clamp recordings were made 3–7 days post-rna injection from a holding potential of ⫺60 mv. the oocytes were superfused with nd96
solution (96 mm nacl, 2 mm kcl, 1 mm mgcl2, 1.8 mm cacl2, 5 mm
hepes, ph 7.5 at 25 °c) at a flow rate of 2 ml min⫺1. to facilitate the
recording of  xxxg1252xxx / xxxg1253xxx  potassium currents, the extracellular solution was switched to a high potassium solution (90 mm kcl, 1 mm
mgcl2, 1.8 mm cacl2, 5 mm hepes). the recording electrodes had a
resistance of 0.5–1.0 m⍀ when filled with 3 m kcl. the measurements
of potassium currents were made from two batches of oocytes harvested
on different days from different toads.  xxxd2715xxx  was applied by
addition to the superfusate, and cumulative concentration response
curves were constructed for each individual oocyte tested.
yeast—human  xxxg1026xxx  was subcloned into p426gpd adjacent to the
promoter (9), transferred to prs306, and integrated into the ura3 locus
of mmy16 (10). ␤-galactosidase assays to measure  xxxg821xxx -lacz reporter
gene induction were performed as described (11) except that nicotinic
acid was omitted from the assay mix, and the substrate fluorescein-␤d-galactopyranoside (molecular probes; final concentration, 20 ␮m) was
used in place of  xxxd24xxx  red-␤-d-galactosidase.
results

 xxxd2715xxx -mediated stimulation of [35s]gtp␥s binding
was observed only in membranes from hek293t cells co-transfected with the cdna for  xxxg1027xxx  and the g protein g␣o1 (fig.
1a). the  xxxd2715xxx -induced stimulation was concentrationdependent and was found to be abolished following pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin (50 ng ml⫺1 for 16 h), suggesting that the effect was gi/o g protein-mediated (fig. 1b).
however, the half-maximal effector concentration for nicotinic
acid was estimated to be in excess of 1 mm, over 1000-fold
higher than that previously reported in rat adipose tissue and
spleen membranes (5). subsequent to the identification of
 xxxg1027xxx  as a low affinity receptor for  xxxd2715xxx , we utilized a
molecular biology approach to identify a novel paralogue of
 xxxg1027xxx , termed  xxxg1026xxx . comparison of the nucleotide sequences of  xxxg1026xxx  and  xxxg1027xxx  revealed 15 base changes as well
as a 5-nucleotide insertion at the 3⬘ end of the clone resulting in
 xxxg1026xxx  possessing a shortened c-terminal tail (fig. 2a). the
two receptors are highly homologous, displaying 96% identity
at the protein level and differing by only 15 amino acids. a
third gene, gpr81, previously identified by customized searching of the genbanktm high throughput genomic sequences
data base (12), was also found to exhibit substantial homology
to  xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx  (57 and 58% amino acid sequence identity, respectively). despite their high degree of similarity,
 xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx  are not simply polymorphic variants but are
separate genes being co-located with gpr81 at chromosome

the clone that resulted in a different 3⬘ coding sequence. the cloning
procedure was performed twice more to confirm the changes in the
amino acid sequence. to confirm the correct initiation methionine, a
cdna clone containing the entire coding region and the 5⬘-untranslated
region was isolated using human placenta cdna library. sequence
analysis of the clone, which we termed  xxxg1026xxx , showed the presence of
a stop codon prior to the first initiation methionine. a murine sequence
with significant homology to human  xxxg1027xxx  was identified by searching
public domain data bases with the peptide sequence for human  xxxg1027xxx 
taken from genbanktm accession number d10923. a tblastn search
produced significant alignment with accession numbers aj300198 and
aj300199, which encode the mus musculus puma-g gene for a putative seven transmembrane-spanning receptor (termed mhm74a). using the human and murine sequence information, the pcr was used to
amplify the corresponding rat gene. the accession number for human
 xxxg1026xxx  is ay148884. the cdna sequence of rat  xxxg1026xxx  is partially
represented by emm_patar098624.
taqman mrna analysis—poly(a)⫹ rna from 20 tissues of four
different individuals (two males, two females except prostate) was
prepared, reverse transcribed, and analyzed by taqman quantitative
pcr as described previously (6). briefly, 1 ␮g of poly(a)⫹ rna was
reverse transcribed using random priming, and the cdna produced was
used to make up to 1,000 replicate plates with each well containing the
cdna from 50 ng of poly(a)⫹ rna. taqman quantitative pcr (applied
biosystems, warrington, uk) was used to assess the level of each gene
relative to genomic dna standards. the data are presented as the
means of mrna copies detected per ng of poly(a)⫹ rna from four
individuals ⫾ s.e. (n ⫽ 4). the gene-specific reagents were:  xxxg1027xxx ,
forward primer, 5⬘-actactatgtgcggcgttcagac-3⬘, and reverse
primer, 5⬘-ggcggttcatggcaaaca-3⬘; taqman probe, 5⬘-accagccggcaagggatgtcc-3⬘;  xxxg1026xxx , forward primer, 5⬘-acaactatgtgaggcgttggga-3⬘, and reverse primer, 5⬘-tggcggttcatagccaaca-3⬘; taqman probe, 5⬘-atcagccggcaagggatgtcc-3⬘;

cell biology—for transient transfections, hek293t cells (hek293
cells stably expressing the sv40 large t-antigen) were maintained in
dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum
and 2 mm glutamine. the cells were seeded in 90-mm culture dishes and
grown to 60 – 80% confluence (18 –24 h) prior to transfection with vectors containing the relevant dna inserts using lipofectamine reagent. for transfection, 9 ␮g of dna was mixed with 30 ␮l of lipofectamine in 0.6 ml of opti-mem (invitrogen) and was incubated at
room temperature for 30 min prior to the addition of 1.6 ml of optimem. the cells were exposed to the lipofectamine/dna mixture for
5 h, and 6 ml of 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s
medium was then added. the cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. pertussis toxin treatment was carried out by supplementation into
the medium at 50 ng ml⫺1 for 16 h. all of the transient transfection
studies involved co-transfection of receptor together with the gi/o g
protein, g␣o1.
for the generation of stable cell lines, the above method was used to
transfect cho-k1 cells seeded in six-well dishes grown to 30% confluence. these cells were maintained in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium/ham’s f-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm
glutamine. 48 h post-transfection the medium was supplemented with
400 ␮g/ml  xxxg418xxx  for selection of antibiotic resistant cells. clonal
cho-k1 cell lines stably expressing  xxxg1026xxx  were confirmed by
[35s]gtp␥s binding measurements, following the addition of nicotinic
acid.
p2 membrane preparation—plasma membrane-containing p2 particulate fractions were prepared from cell pastes frozen at ⫺80 °c after
harvest. all of the procedures were carried out at 4 °c. the cell pellets
were resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mm tris-hcl and 0.1 mm edta, ph 7.5
(buffer a), and by homogenization for 20 s with a ultra turrax followed
by passage (5 times) through a 25-gauge needle. the cell lysates were
centrifuged at 1,000 ⫻ g for 10 min in a microcentrifuge to pellet the
nuclei and unbroken cells, and p2 particulate fractions were recovered
by microcentrifugation at 16,000 ⫻ g for 30 min. p2 particulate fractions were resuspended in buffer a and stored at ⫺80 °c until required.
[3h] xxxd2715xxx  binding—saturation binding assays were carried
out on plasma membrane-containing p2 particulate fractions from
hek293t cells transiently co-expressing  xxxg1026xxx  and g␣o1 using 3hlabeled  xxxd2715xxx  as described (5). briefly, the membranes (10
␮g/point) were incubated with increasing concentrations of [5,6-3h] xxxd2715xxx  (60 ci/mmol; biotrend) for 3 h at room temperature with
agitation. the assay was performed in 50 mm tris-hcl ph 7.4 binding

(filled columns)  xxxd2715xxx  to membranes from hek293t cells expressing a variety of orphan g protein-coupled receptors was found to
stimulate [35s]gtp␥s binding in membranes from cells expressing
 xxxg1027xxx  only (open columns, basal conditions). b,  xxxd2715xxx  stimulated a dose-dependent increase in [35s]gtp␥s binding in cells expressing  xxxg1027xxx  (filled circles) that was ablated by pretreatment with 50 ng
ml⫺1 pertussis toxin for 16 h prior to harvest (triangles). all of the
transient transfection studies involved co-transfection of receptor together with the gi/o g protein, g␣o1.

12q24.31 (part of this region of chromosome 12 is represented
by accession number ac026362). messenger rna expression
profiling of  xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx  using taqman quantitative
reverse transcriptase-pcr analysis with probes designed and
confirmed to discriminate between these two homologous receptors (data not shown) showed that both exhibited similar
distribution patterns that were largely restricted to adipose
tissue and spleen (fig. 2b). hence, the expression patterns of
 xxxg1026xxx  and  xxxg1027xxx  are concomitant with that of a  xxxd2715xxx 
receptor. interestingly, gpr81 appears to be highly restricted
to adipose tissue.
expression of  xxxg1026xxx  together with g␣o1 in hek293t cells
gave robust concentration-dependent responses to nicotinic
acid with a half-maximal concentration (ec50 ⫽ 250 ⫾ 27 nm)
similar to that observed in rat adipose tissue and spleen membranes (5) (fig. 3a). conversely, gpr81 responded to nicotinic
acid only at relatively high concentrations (10 mm). expression
of  xxxg1026xxx , but not  xxxg1027xxx  or gpr81, also produced saturable
specific binding of 3h-labeled  xxxd2715xxx  with an affinity (kd
95.8 ⫾ 9.5 nm) similar to that recorded from rat adipose tissue
and spleen membranes (5) (fig. 3b). we have not been able to
quantify the levels of expression of  xxxg1027xxx  and gpr81 because
of their low affinity for  xxxd2715xxx . next, we expressed
 xxxg1026xxx  and  xxxg1027xxx  in xenopus oocytes to study their coupling
to the gi-g protein-regulated potassium channels  xxxg1252xxx  and
 xxxg1253xxx  (13). concentration-dependent responses to nicotinic
acid with a half-maximal concentration (ec50) of 130 ⫾ 50 nm
were observed for  xxxg1026xxx  (four oocytes). responses to nicotinic

saccharomyces cerevisiae, measuring receptor activation with
a reporter gene. using  xxxd2715xxx -free growth medium, we
demonstrated concentration-dependent activation of  xxxg1026xxx 
in response to  xxxd2715xxx  (ec50 ⫽ 904 ⫾ 28 nm; fig. 3d).
the optimal agonist responses were observed with chimeric
yeast/mammalian g␣ subunits having the c-terminal 5
amino acids of gi or the promiscuous g␣, g16 (fig. 3d and
data not shown) (11). the yeast data confirm that  xxxg1026xxx  is
sufficient to confer the  xxxd2715xxx  response, because these
cells lack endogenous g protein-coupled receptors capable of
activating this pathway.
a number of  xxxd2715xxx  analogues were employed to characterize  xxxg1026xxx  using the [35s]gtp␥s binding assay (table i).
similar rank orders of potency were found at  xxxg1026xxx  compared
with those previously described in native rat tissue (5),
whereas all of the analogues displayed either no or very weak
activity at  xxxg1027xxx  (data not shown). all of the analogues were
also inactive at gpr81 (data not shown). furthermore, we also
cloned the rat orthologue of  xxxg1026xxx , which was found to exhibit 82% identity at the protein level with its human counterpart (fig. 2a). as expected, no significant pharmacological
differences were observed between recombinantly expressed
rat and human  xxxg1026xxx  (table i).
acipimox (olbetam) and acifran (ay-25,712) are two molecules that have been reported to produce a pharmacological
profile resembling that of  xxxd2715xxx  in rat and human
studies (14 –17) (fig. 4a). using the [35s]gtp␥s binding assay,
we found that acipimox was a full agonist at  xxxg1026xxx  (ec50 ⫽
6 ⫾ 1 ␮m) and exhibited weak activity at  xxxg1027xxx  and no activity
at gpr81. acifran acted as a full and relatively potent agonist
at both  xxxg1026xxx  (ec50 ⫽ 2.1 ⫾ 0.2 ␮m) and  xxxg1027xxx  (ec50 ⫽ 20 ⫾
4 ␮m) but showed no significant agonism at gpr81 up to 1 mm
(fig. 4b). acifran also activated  xxxg1026xxx  in yeast (ec50 ⫽ 3.0 ⫾
0.08 ␮m). the fact that acifran has been identified as a high
affinity ligand for  xxxg1027xxx  (fig. 4b) strongly suggests that our
transfection system is sufficiently efficient to allow agonist
profiling. furthermore, the signal to noise ratios observed with
acifran at both  xxxg1026xxx  and  xxxg1027xxx  are similar, which suggests

identification of receptors for  xxxd2715xxx 
that these receptors are expressed at similar levels. in addition, we have expressed  xxxg1026xxx  and  xxxg1027xxx  in a range of
different systems (mammalian, yeast, and oocyte), and in all of
these expression systems there is an ⬃1000-fold separation in
the potency of  xxxd2715xxx , suggesting that this is a real
observation.
acifran and acipimox were included in a group of molecules
with structural or pharmacological similarities with nicotinic
acid that were tested in a [3h] xxxd2715xxx  displacement assay
performed in membranes from either a stable cho cell line
expressing recombinant human  xxxg1026xxx  or human adipocytes
(table ii). the rank order of potency for the displacement of
[3h] xxxd2715xxx  binding was  xxxd2715xxx  ⬎ 5-methyl  xxxd3045xxx -3-carboxylic acid ⫽ pyridine-3-acetic acid ⬎ acifran ⬎
5-methyl  xxxd2715xxx  ⫽ acipimox ⬎⬎ nicotinuric acid ⫽ nicotinamide. this rank order of potency was the same in both the
stable cho cell line expressing recombinant human  xxxg1026xxx 
and human adipocytes.

discussion

 xxxg1027xxx  was identified as a low affinity receptor for nicotinic
acid following the screening of a panel of orphan receptors
selected because of their tissue expression profile.  xxxg1027xxx  is
an orphan receptor that had been previously cloned from a
cdna library derived from human monocytes (18). the halfmaximal effector concentration for  xxxd2715xxx  at  xxxg1027xxx 
was estimated to be in excess of 1 mm, ⬃1000-fold higher than
that previously reported in membranes produced from rat
adipose tissue or spleen (5). we considered three possible
explanations for this discrepancy in  xxxd2715xxx  potency.
first, close homologues of  xxxg1027xxx  may act as higher affinity
 xxxd2715xxx  receptors. second, because g protein-mediated
 xxxd2715xxx  effects on native tissue have almost always
been recorded from rat, variation between human and rodent
receptors may explain this phenomenon. finally, differences
in the pharmacological integrity of the recombinantly expressed receptor and its endogenously expressed counterpart
may explain potency changes.
a molecular biology approach resulted in the identification of
a novel paralogue of  xxxg1027xxx , termed  xxxg1026xxx . despite their high
degree of similarity,  xxxg1027xxx  and  xxxg1026xxx  are not simply polymorphic variants but are separate genes being co-located with
gpr81 at chromosome 12q24.31. taqman analysis confirmed
that the expression pattern of  xxxg1026xxx  was very similar to
 xxxg1027xxx . when expressed in a variety of test systems,  xxxg1026xxx 
was confirmed as a high affinity receptor for  xxxd2715xxx . the
activity and affinity of  xxxd2715xxx  was in good agreement
with that previously reported in the literature (5). furthermore, following the cloning of the rat orthologue of  xxxg1026xxx , we
found no significant pharmacological differences between  xxxd2715xxx  derivatives tested against either human or rat
 xxxg1026xxx . the murine variant of  xxxg1026xxx , puma-g, was recently reported to be an interferon ␥-inducible gene in macrophages, suggesting a possible role in macrophage function (19).
this finding is further supported by a recent report describing
a  xxxg1026xxx  in a murine macrophage cell line (20).
based on the taqman data generated for the distribution of
human  xxxg1026xxx , there appears to be little or no expression in
macrophages (fig. 2b). this may indicate that species differences in the distribution of  xxxg1026xxx  exist or is a reflection of the
activation state of the macrophages used in this experiment. it
will be of interest to determine whether the expression of
 xxxg1026xxx  can be up-regulated in human macrophages following
incubation with interferon ␥.
in the [3h] xxxd2715xxx  displacement assay, both the absolute potency and the rank order of potency of the  xxxg1026xxx 
ligands studied was the same, whether tested against the stable cho cell line expressing recombinant human  xxxg1026xxx  or
human adipocytes. these data strongly suggest that  xxxg1026xxx  is
the gi-g protein-coupled  xxxg1026xxx  on human adipocytes. acipimox and acifran have also been identified as full

agonists at  xxxg1026xxx . these compounds have also been reported
to produce a pharmacological effect resembling that of nicotinic
acid in rat and human studies (14 –17). the other compounds
identified that displace  xxxd2715xxx  from  xxxg1026xxx , 5-methyl
 xxxd3045xxx -3-carboxylic acid,  xxxd2715xxx , and
5-methyl  xxxd2715xxx , have all previously been shown to
inhibit adipocyte lipolysis (2, 23). nicotinamide, which unlike
 xxxd2715xxx  produces no alteration in lipoprotein profiles (22),
acted only as a very weak agonist at  xxxg1026xxx . indeed, nicotinamide was ⬃1000-fold less potent than  xxxd2715xxx , a level of
activity that could be due to contaminant  xxxd2715xxx  (e.g.
0.1%). it would appear that activation of  xxxg1026xxx  would account
for the inhibition of lipolysis observed with these compounds.
therefore, of the compounds that have been tested in man, it
would appear that potency at  xxxg1026xxx  is linked with their
efficacy at normalizing lipoprotein profiles.
we have demonstrated that  xxxg1026xxx  is a high affinity receptor for  xxxd2715xxx  and believe that this receptor is a
likely candidate as a molecule target for the beneficial therapeutic effects observed with  xxxd2715xxx .  xxxd2715xxx  is
an effective therapeutic agent; however, it has to be administered at high doses and has a characteristic side effect
profile defined by intense, but transient, prostaglandinmediated cutaneous vasodilation (“flushing”) that affects patient compliance (21, 22).
unlike  xxxg1026xxx , we were unable to identify rodent orthologues of  xxxg1027xxx  using conventional gene cloning strategies and
bioinformatics searches. this suggests that in humans  xxxg1027xxx 
may be the result of a relatively recent gene duplication event.
furthermore, of the compounds tested, only acifran exhibited
activity at  xxxg1027xxx . in fact, acifran is the first molecule that we
have identified to date that exhibits significant potency at
 xxxg1027xxx . because of the high degree of homology between
 xxxg1026xxx  and  xxxg1027xxx  and the existence of highly selective ligands, site-directed mutagenesis may be a useful strategy in
determining which amino acid residues play a key role in
ligand binding. indeed, 11 amino acid residues are conserved
in human and rat  xxxg1026xxx  but not in  xxxg1027xxx  (fig. 2a). such
residues may play key roles in determining the differences in
ligand binding affinities between  xxxg1026xxx  and  xxxg1027xxx . the identification of  xxxg1026xxx  as a molecular target for  xxxd2715xxx  will
facilitate the discovery of potent and selective ligands for this

molecular identification of high and low affinity receptors for  xxxd2715xxx
