ate their biological actions through two pharmacologically defined g-protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs), named the  xxxg599xxx 
and cyslt2 (2, 3). the recent cloning and characterization of
the human  xxxg599xxx  confirmed the previous pharmacological data (refs. 4 and 5; genbanktm accession nos. af
119711 and af 133266). ltd4 is the preferred endogenous
ligand for the  xxxg599xxx , and activation of the receptor
results in an elevation of intracellular calcium (4, 5). the gene
for the  xxxg599xxx  has been mapped to human chromosome xq13-q21 (4, 5). the  xxxg599xxx  is the molecular
target of the anti-asthmatic drugs montelukast (singulairtm),
 xxxd3545xxx  (accolatetm), and  xxxd2995xxx  (onontm) that have
both anti-bronchoconstrictive and anti-inflammatory actions
(6 – 8). all known cyslt receptor antagonists, except bay
u9773 (a nonselective antagonist at  xxxg599xxx  and cyslt2 receptors) selectively antagonize activation of the  xxxg599xxx 
(6 –9).  xxxg599xxx  mrna and protein are expressed on
human lung smooth muscle cells and tissue macrophages and
on peripheral blood monocytes and eosinophils (4).2
the cyslt2 receptor has been documented pharmacologically to be expressed in guinea pig trachea and ileum, ferret
trachea and spleen, sheep bronchus, and human pulmonary
and saphenous vein preparations (2, 10, 11). at the cyslt2
receptor subtype, the agonist potency rank order is ltc4 ⫽
ltd4 ⬎⬎ lte4, and lte4 is a partial agonist (2). we describe
here the molecular cloning and characterization of the human
cyslt2 receptor.
experimental procedures

materials—ltd4 and ltc4 were from cayman (ann arbor, mi);
ltb4, lte4, and bay u9773 were from biomol (plymouth meeting,
pa); 1-oleoyl lysophosphatidic acid was from avanti polar lipids (alabaster, al). mk-571, montelukast,  xxxd2995xxx , and  xxxd3545xxx  were
synthesized by the department of medicinal chemistry at merck
frosst, and [3h]ltd4 (146 ci/mmol) was from nen life science
products.
cloning of hg57, the cyslt2 receptor—a partial rat est (accession
no. ai178926) encoding a gpcr fragment, with 40% identity to the
human  xxxg599xxx , was found during a routine search of updates
to the genbanktm data base of expressed sequence tags using the
fast_pan program (12). the cognate cdna was retrieved from the
american type culture collection and was used to screen a rat brain
cdna library as reported previously (13). two cdnas were obtained
that had a translational open reading frame of 981 nucleotides. this
putative receptor, designated by the expressed sequence tags clone
name, rspbt32, was 40% identical to the human  xxxg599xxx  but
16 and 21 amino acids shorter at the n- and c-terminal ends, respec2

the contractile and inflammatory actions of the cysteinyl leukotrienes (cyslts), ltc4, ltd4, and lte4, are
thought to be mediated through at least two distinct but
related cyslt g protein-coupled receptors. the human
 xxxg599xxx  has been recently cloned and characterized. we describe here the cloning and characterization of the second cysteinyl leukotriene receptor,
cyslt2, a 346-amino acid protein with 38% amino acid
identity to the  xxxg599xxx . the recombinant human cyslt2 receptor was expressed in xenopus oocytes
and hek293t cells and shown to couple to elevation of
intracellular calcium when activated by ltc4, ltd4, or
lte4. analyses of radiolabeled ltd4 binding to the recombinant cyslt2 receptor demonstrated high affinity
binding and a rank order of potency for competition of
ltc4 ⴝ ltd4 >> lte4. in contrast to the dual  xxxg599xxx /
cyslt2 antagonist, bay u9773, the  xxxg599xxx -selective antagonists mk-571, montelukast (singulairtm),
 xxxd3545xxx  (accolatetm), and  xxxd2995xxx  (onontm) exhibited low potency in competition for ltd4 binding
and as antagonists of cyslt2 receptor signaling. cyslt2
receptor mrna was detected in lung macrophages and
airway smooth muscle, cardiac purkinje cells, adrenal
medulla cells, peripheral blood leukocytes, and brain,
and the receptor gene was mapped to chromosome
13q14, a region linked to atopic asthma.

characterization of human cysteinyl leukotriene 2 receptor
in situ hybridization analysis and immunohistochemistry—the
oligonucleotide antisense probes used for the in situ studies were 5⬘-ccaggcactcctgatgct-3⬘ and 5⬘-cccaccaccaaggaata-3⬘, and
their complementary sequences were used as sense probes. tailing of
oligonucleotides with biotin-16-dutp (roche molecular biochemicals)
was carried out as described by the manufacturer except for substitution of digoxigenin-dutp with biotin-16-dutp in the tailing reaction.
in situ hybridization was carried out on 6-␮m cryostat sections of
surgical human lung specimens (national disease research interchange, philadelphia, pa) using 2 pmol/ml labeled oligonucleotides for
18 h at 37 °c. bound probe was visualized using texas red tyramide
signal amplification detection reagent (nen life science products)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from buffy coat preparations by centrifugation over lymphocyte separation medium (icn). t cells were rosetted by
incubation of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells with neuraminidase-treated sheep red blood cells and pelleted through lymphocyte
separation medium. the sheep red blood cells were removed by lysis
with ack lysis buffer (life technologies). t cell-depleted peripheral
blood mononuclear cells accumulated at the interface of the lymphocyte
separation medium. eosinophils were prepared from peripheral blood
from a donor known to have elevated peripheral blood eosinophils but
no history of asthmatic disease. erythrocytes were removed by hypotonic lysis of the pelleted cells, followed by negative selection with
anti-cd16 microbeads (miltenyi biotech) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the purity of eosinophil preparations was ⬎90% with
some contaminating monocytes and neutrophils. all preparations of
cells were resuspended in o.c.t. compound (miles scientific) and fresh
frozen prior to in situ hybridization. in situ hybridization on these cell
preparations was carried out exactly as described above for tissue
sections. sections and cells were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (molecular probes, inc., eugene, or) to visualize cell
nuclei, and images were digitally acquired and reassembled using a
micromax ccd camera (princeton instruments) and the metamorph
imaging program (universal imaging). cell nuclei are seen in teal blue
pseudocolor or in conventional 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole blue. immunohistochemistry was performed after in situ hybridization, with
antibodies ln5 (zymed laboratories inc.), cd14 (serotec), and protein
gene product 9.5 (biomeda corp.) at the manufacturer’s specified dilutions for 2 h at room temperature. primary antibody markers were
detected with either a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey
anti-mouse igg (jackson immunoresearch) or a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rat igg (jackson immunoresearch). colocalization of red (in situ) and green (antibody) staining is seen as yellow
fluorescence.
chromosomal localization—chromosomal mapping of the cyslt2
receptor gene was performed using the genebridge 4 panel, consisting
of 93 radiation hybrid clones (research genetics, huntsville, al). two
primer pairs were designed from the hg57 sequence to amplify each of
two different regions of the gene. primer pair 1 sequences (5⬘-aatggcaccttcagcaataaca-3⬘ (forward) and 5⬘-tggacaacccatttcccaagac-3⬘ (reverse)) produced a band of ⬃100 base pairs; primer
pair 2 sequences (5⬘-agactgcataaagctttggttatc-3⬘ (forward)
and 5⬘-atactcttgtttcctttctcaacc-3⬘ (reverse)) produced a
band of ⬃180 base pairs. polymerase chain reaction was performed
with amplitaq gold (perkin-elmer) using the following cycling parameters: 94 °c for 9 min; 94 °c for 2 min, 62 °c for 30 s, 72 °c for 1 min (32
cycles), and 72 °c for 7 min. results were submitted to the whitehead
institute genome center server (available on the world wide web) and
confirmed by quantum somatic cell hybrid pcrable panel (quantum) and stanford g3 radiation hybrid panel (research genetics).
results and discussion

sequence comparison—phylogenetic analysis (fig. 1a)
showed that the human orphan gpcr hg57 (identified here as
the cyslt2 receptor) was 73% identical to the rat orphan
gpcr rsbpt32 sequence, 38% identical to the human  xxxg599xxx 
receptor sequence, and 33–35% identical to the human orphan
gpcrs gpr17 and gpr23. despite its high similarity to
hg57, we have been unable to demonstrate cyslt activation
of the rat rsbpt32 receptor (data not shown). the deduced
amino acid sequence of hg57 (the cyslt2 receptor), portrayed
as a putative seven-transmembrane domain protein in threedimensional helical representation, is shown in fig. 1b (genbanktm sequence af254664). the primary sequence of the
cyslt2 receptor is quite dissimilar to another leukotriene re-

tively. the rspbt32 protein sequence was added to the fast_pan
gpcr query set, and during a subsequent search of genbanktm releases, we found a human genome survey sequence deposition (accession no. aq001459) encoding a peptide fragment that was about 70%
identical to rspbt32. the genome survey sequence was used to design
oligonucleotide primers for the polymerase chain reaction, and ultimately we isolated a human genomic dna fragment that contained a
1041-nucleotide open reading frame encoding a 346-amino acid protein
that we named hg57. the amplified product was subcloned into the ta
cloning site of the mammalian cdna expression vector pcr3.1 (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca), and the sequence of the inserted dna was
determined.
xenopus laevis oocyte expression—hg57 (cyslt2) crna was produced by in vitro transcription (t7 mmessage mmachine, ambion)
using t7 rna polymerase in the presence of a capping analogue. 20 – 40
ng of the capped crna was injected into stage v-vi x. laevis oocytes as
described previously (14, 15). compounds were delivered as a 30-␮l
aliquot over a period of 1–2 s, and the recording chamber was washed
with 30% methanol between oocyte assays to remove residual ligand. x.
laevis were purchased from xenopus i (ann arbor, mi).
aequorin luminescence functional assay—human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells stably expressing the sv40 large t antigen, designated hek 293t cells, were transfected with hg57 (cyslt2)-pcr3.1
or pcr3.1 and aeq-pcdm plasmids (5 ␮g of each dna per 75-cm2
culture flask), using the lipofectamine™ plus reagent (life technologies, inc.) following the manufacturer’s instructions. cells were
prepared subsequently for use in the aequorin luminescence functional
assay as described previously (16). briefly, agonists in  xxxd1896xxx  or ethanol were serially diluted, in duplicate, in a white 96-well
cliniplate fb (labsystems) using a biomek in a final volume of 100 ␮l
in phosphate-buffered saline (with 70 mg of cacl2) so that the final
solvent concentration was ⱕ1%. the plate was then loaded into the
luminoskan rs plate-reading luminometer (labsystems, needham
heights, ma), and wells were tested sequentially. cells (⬃2–5 ⫻ 104) in
100 ␮l of ham’s f12 medium were injected into the well, and light
emission was recorded over 30 s (peak 1). the cells were then lysed by
injection of 25 ␮l of 0.9% triton x-100 solution in h2o, and light
emission was measured for an additional 10 s (peak 2). for the antagonist, the plate was divided into four series. series 1 contained a
leukotriene c4 or leukotriene d4 control curve into which transfected
cells were injected in the absence of the antagonist, while series 2– 4
contained leukotriene c4 or leukotriene d4 curves, into which cells that
had been preincubated for 15 min in the presence of a given concentration of antagonist were injected.
fractional luminescence for each well was determined by dividing
the area under peak 1 by the total area under peaks 1 and 2 (p1/(p1 ⫹
p2)). these calculations were performed using the lskan controller
program, and data files were analyzed using the ldam software employing a modified version of the levenberg-marquardt four-parameter
curve-fitting algorithm to calculate ec50 values (14). for the antagonist
tests, the ec50 values were then used to generate a kb value using
schild plot analysis.
radioligand binding assays—cos-7 cell transfection, harvesting,
and membrane preparation were done as previously reported (17).
tritiated ltd4 binding assays were performed as described (17) with
the exception that the reaction was initiated by the addition of 250 ␮g
of membrane protein and that 4 mm  xxxd72xxx  replaced serine-borate in
equilibrium competition assays with ltc4. ltd4-specific binding was
calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding, determined in the presence of 1 ␮m ltd4, from total binding. specific binding accounted for
50 – 60% of the total binding and was linear with respect to the concentrations of radioligand and protein present in the incubation. total
binding represented less than 10% of the radioligand added to the
incubation. in these conditions, average total and nonspecific binding of
[3h]ltd4 for 250 ␮g of hg57 (cyslt2) receptor membrane protein was
2600 and 1200 dpm, respectively.
northern blot analysis—rnas from several human tissues were
extracted as described previously (18). total rna was extracted by the
method of chomczynski and sacci (19), and poly(a)⫹ rna was isolated
using oligo(dt)-cellulose spin columns (amersham pharmacia biotech).
rna was denatured and size-fractionated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred onto nylon membrane, and immobilized by uv
irradiation. the blots were hybridized with a 32p-labeled dna fragment
encoding the cyslt2 receptor, washed with 2⫻ sspe and 0.1% sds at
room temperature for 15 min, washed again with 0.5⫻ sspe and 0.1%
sds at 50 °c for 45 min, subjected to four final washings with 0.2⫻
sspe and 0.1% sds at 50 °c each for 1 h, and exposed to x-ray film at
⫺70 °c in the presence of an intensifying screen for 3–7 days.

although there is no record of hg57 in the expressed sequence

xenopus oocyte functional activation—the cyslts ltd4
and ltc4 produced calcium-dependent chloride flux in hg57
(cyslt2) receptor crna-injected x. laevis oocytes and were
desensitized to subsequent challenge by cyslts (fig. 2a and

data not shown). control oocytes injected with saline or other
gpcr crnas, including those encoding rspbt32 and gpr17,
showed no response to ltd4 or ltc4 but were able to respond
to lysophosphatidic acid challenge through an endogenous lysophosphatidic acid receptor (fig. 2b). ltd4 and ltc4 produced dose-dependent activation of calcium-dependent chloride
flux in hg57 (cyslt2) receptor crna-injected xenopus oocytes, and the maximal response was not significantly reduced
by preincubation with pertussis toxin (fig. 2c), indicative that
cyslt2 did not couple to gi␣ in this system. the ltd4 or ltc4
activation of calcium-dependent chloride flux in the hg57
(cyslt2)-expressing oocytes was not blocked by the  xxxg599xxx 
receptor-selective antagonist, mk-571, but was blocked by the
dual  xxxg599xxx /cyslt2 receptor antagonist bay u9773 (fig. 2d
and data not shown).
transient expression and functional activation in mammalian cells—in hg57 (cyslt2) and aequorin-co-expressing
hek293t cells, ltd4 and ltc4 were equipotent agonists,
while lte4 behaved as a partial agonist, and ltb4 was inactive up to 3 ␮m (fig. 3a). these agonists show no response in
vector-transfected aequorin-expressing hek293t cells (data
not shown). bay u9773 acted as a noncompetitive antagonist of
both ltc4- and ltd4-challenged cyslt2 receptor-expressing
hek293t cells (fig. 3b). the selective  xxxg599xxx  antagonists, mk-571, montelukast,  xxxd3545xxx , and  xxxd2995xxx ,
showed no significant antagonism of the cyslt2 receptor up to
1 ␮m concentration (fig. 3c).
radioligand binding characterization—saturation analysis
of [3h]ltd4-specific binding to cos-7 cell membranes transiently expressing hg57 (cyslt2) was performed in two separate experiments with two different membrane preparations.

cyslt2 receptor mrna in human lung (fig. 6, a–e). in contrast to the  xxxg599xxx , which was most highly expressed
in human lung smooth muscle (4), the strongest lung expression of the cyslt2 receptor was seen in interstitial macrophages (fig. 6, a–c) with distinctly weaker expression in
smooth muscle cells (fig. 6, d and e). it was of interest that we
noted particularly elevated expression of the cyslt2 receptor
in macrophages when in close proximity to smooth muscle cells
(fig. 6d). peripheral blood leukocytes were another abundant
source for cyslt2 receptor transcripts (fig. 5). we carried out
in situ analysis of the cyslt2 receptor in partly purified normal human peripheral blood monocytes and demonstrated
abundant expression in greater than 20% of these cells (fig.
6f). in addition, we found strong expression of the receptor in
purified human eosinophils, a cell type in which we had previously shown expression of the  xxxg599xxx  (ref. 4; fig. 6, g
and h).2
tissues other than myeloid cell containing organs, such as
the spleen and lymph nodes, that showed expression of the
mrna for the cyslt2 receptor included regions of the central
nervous system, the adrenal gland, and the heart. the synthesis and activities of cysteinyl leukotrienes in the brain of various animal species has been well documented (21–23). studies
on expression of both the  xxxg599xxx  and cyslt2 receptors in the
central nervous system are under way in our laboratories. in
situ analyses of the cyslt2 receptor in adrenal gland showed
expression in medullary pheochromocytes and ganglion cells
(fig. 7a). pheochromocytes were identified by their morphology
and granular nonhomogenous cytoplasm. cyslt2 receptor expression was also noted in the zona reticularis adjacent to the
corticomedullary junction. the expression of the cyslt2 receptor in the adrenal gland was unexpected, and the biological
roles of cyslts in the adrenal medulla are unknown. in the
human heart, cyslt2 receptor expression was concentrated in
purkinje fiber cells, identified by their characteristic morphology as transitional cells with large nuclei in histologically inhomogenous areas, with few myofibrils (fig. 7, c–e). consistent with purkinje cell identity, these cyslt2 receptorexpressing cells co-expressed pgp9.5 (protein gene product 9.5)
(data not shown). in contrast, the  xxxg599xxx  has not been
detected in the heart (4, 5). a considerable pharmacological
literature exists on the synthesis and actions of cyslts in
human vasculature (24 –26). the restricted expression of
cyslt2 in the heart is intriguing.
the human cyslt2 receptor was localized to chromosome
13q14 by radiation hybrid and somatic cell hybrid analyses.
the marker closest to the cyslt2 receptor gene was d13s153.
this is of particular interest, since this marker has been associated with atopic asthma in both a united kingdom population (27) and in a japanese population study (28). we are

investigating the possible linkage of polymorphisms within the
cyslt2 receptor gene to the asthmatic phenotype. the recent
deposition of a bacterial artificial chromosome in the high
through put genome sequencing division of genbanktm
(clone_id_rp11–108p5) containing the precise hg57 (cyslt2)
receptor open reading frame reports a map position of 13q14.2–
21.1, which is in agreement with our experimentally determined localization. the cloning and characterization of the
human cyslt2 receptor will allow a detailed molecular characterization of its activation in pulmonary, hematologic, cardiovascular, endocrine, and central nervous system tissues.
