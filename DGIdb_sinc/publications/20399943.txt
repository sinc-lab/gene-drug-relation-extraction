abstract
background: first-trimester abortions especially cervical dilation and suction aspiration are associated with pain despite various methods of
pain control.
study design: following the guidelines for a cochrane review, we systematically searched for and reviewed randomized controlled trials
comparing methods of pain control in first-trimester surgical abortion at less than 14 weeks gestational age using electric or manual suction
aspiration. outcomes included intra- and postoperative pain, side effects, recovery measures and satisfaction.
results: we included 40 trials with 5131 participants. because of heterogeneity, we divided studies into seven groups:
local anesthesia: data were insufficient to show a clear benefit of a paracervical block (pcb) compared to no pcb. reported mean pain
scores (10-point scale) during dilation and aspiration were improved with carbonated lidocaine [weighted mean difference (wmd), −0.80;
95% confidence interval (ci), −0.89 to −0.71; wmd, −0.96; 95% ci, −1.67 to −0.25], deep injection (wmd, −1.64; 95% ci, −3.21 to
−0.08; wmd, 1.00; 95% ci, 1.09 to 0.91), and with adding a 4% intrauterine lidocaine infusion (wmd, −2.0; 95% ci, −3.29 to −0.71;
wmd, −2.8; 95% ci, −3.95 to −1.65).
pcb with premedication: ibuprofen and naproxen resulted in small reduction of intra- and postoperative pain.
conscious sedation: the addition of conscious intravenous sedation using diazepam and fentanyl to pcb decreased procedural pain.
general anesthesia: conscious sedation increased intraoperative but decreased postoperative pain compared to general anesthesia (ga)
[peto odds ratio (peto or) 14.77 (95%, ci 4.91–44.38) and peto or 7.47 (95% ci, 2.2–25.36) for dilation and aspiration, respectively, and
wmd −1.00 (95% ci, −1.77 to −0.23) postoperatively). inhalation anesthetics are associated with increased blood loss (pb0.001).
ga with premedication: the cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 inhibitor  xxxd2069xxx ; the nonselective cox inhibitors  xxxd2508xxx , diclofenac and
ketorolac im; and the opioid nalbuphine improved postoperative pain.
nonpharmacological intervention: listening to music decreased procedural pain.
no major complication was observed.
conclusions: conscious sedation, ga and some nonpharmacological interventions decreased procedural and postoperative pain, while being
safe and satisfactory to patients. data on the widely used pcb are inadequate to support its use, and it needs to be further studied to determine
any benefit.

1. introduction
elective abortions are among the most common outpatient surgical procedures performed on women with an
estimated 46 million performed yearly worldwide [1]. nearly
90% are performed in the first trimester before 13 weeks

gestation [2]. a major complication occurs in less than 1 in
100 women and mortality is around 0.7 in 100,000 [3–5].
complications from all forms of anesthesia accounted for
16% of all legally induced abortion mortality in the united
states in the years 1988 to 1997, a marked decrease from the
29% attributable to general anesthesia (ga) alone reported
for 1983 to 1987 [4,6].
anesthesia is important for women undergoing an
abortion since most will experience pain with the procedure.

key factors that influence the choice of anesthesia or
analgesia include effectiveness, safety, side effects and costs.
other important factors include patient preference, practitioner choice or bias, facility resources and medical
indications [7].
pain perception is a complex phenomenon composed of
both physical and psychosocial elements and their interaction, and varies considerably among women [8]. the
physical pain associated with abortion most likely originates
from the s2 to s4 parasympathetic fibers (the frankenhäuser
plexus) that innervate the cervix and the lower part of the
uterine body [9,10]. in addition, the fundus and lower part of
uterine body are innervated by sympathetic fibers from t10
to l1 via the inferior hypogastric nerve and the ovarian
plexus [7].
additionally, psychological (affective, motivational, interpretive) and social (context, support) features play into
pain perception [11]. increased pain with abortion has been
associated with young age, nulliparity, less education,
anxiety, depression, “moral problems” (with the procedure),
a retroverted uterus and dysmenorrhea [12,13]. a history of
prior vaginal delivery correlates well with decreased pain
[12]. data on the relationship between pain and gestational
age, as well as the amount of cervical dilation performed,
have been conflicting [11,12,14].
due to this complex nature, effective management of
abortion-related pain requires a combination of pharmacological and nonpharmacological methods [7]. pharmacological methods include local anesthetic, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications, narcotics, anxiolytics, sedatives
and/or hypnotics. concerns regarding ga stem from its
association with greater costs and personnel and increased
morbidity and mortality based on observational data that
include analysis of cases until the mid-1980s [7,15–17].
therefore, ga is less frequently used in the united states
[18,19] compared to other countries, where abortions occur
primarily in hospitals [20].
nonpharmacological aspects of pain have a considerable
impact on pain perception [7]. active participation in one's
own pain management and control over the life situation
have been found to be beneficial [12].
unfortunately, despite these advances, many patients still
find surgical abortion extremely uncomfortable; 78–97%
report at least moderate procedural pain [8,12,14,21].
therefore, optimizing pain control should be a goal in
every procedure. opinions may vary on how much pain
reduction is clinically relevant. strategies designed to reduce
abortion-related pain have great public health importance
considering the large numbers of women who undergo firsttrimester surgical abortions.
this review will examine the existing randomized
controlled trials to compare the effect of different methods
of pain control during first-trimester surgical abortion on
patient-perceived pain, satisfaction, side effects and safety.
the review will investigate preemptive as well as intraoperative analgesia, focusing on pharmacological methods

administered via mucosal (oral, vaginal, intrauterine, buccal/
sublingual), intramuscular or intravenous routes, but also
include nonpharmacological methods. the objective of this
review is to compare the effect of different methods of
pharmacological and nonpharmacological pain control
administered prior to or during first-trimester surgical
abortion (b14 weeks gestation with electric or manual
suction aspiration) on patient perceived pain, satisfaction,
side effects and safety.
2. materials and methods
2.1. criteria for eligible trials
randomized controlled trials, of different types of pain
control, including placebo-controlled, in any language
comparing pharmacological pain control administered via
mucosal (oral, vaginal, intrauterine, buccal/sublingual),
intramuscular, or intravenous routes or nonpharmacological
pain control prior to or during a first-trimester surgical
abortion at less than 14 weeks gestational age using electric
or manual suction aspiration were reviewed.
the main outcome was patient-reported effectiveness of
pain control or perceived pain during and immediately postabortion using validated scales, for example, visual and
verbal analogue scales, categorical or dichotomous assessment. additional outcomes were adverse effects and side
effects (including if the method of pain control causes pain),
as well as patient satisfaction.
2.2. search methods
we identified trials using the cochrane fertility regulation group search strategy. without language preference, we
searched the cochrane central register of controlled trials
(fourth quarter, 2007), medline (1950 to january 2008),
embase (1974 to january 2008) and popline (1927 to
december 2007) with appropriate keywords. we contacted
professionals in the field to seek other trials and searched
reference lists of articles retrieved.
2.3. data extraction
we evaluated titles and abstracts of the search results for
eligibility and retrieved full text articles if they possibly met
inclusion criteria. in some cases, inclusion was based on
additional information received from the study's author.
if the authors specified that they performed terminations
in the first trimester, but did not state that the procedure
was performed by suction aspiration versus sharp curettage, and the study was performed in a time period and
region where suction aspiration was the predominant
procedure method, we assumed that the study used suction
aspiration as well and, therefore, included the study. if a
sharp curettage check was preformed after suction
aspiration, we included the study and noted this step in
the individual included study table.

374

r.m. renner et al. / contraception 81 (2010) 372–388

quality assessment and data extraction were done by two
independent authors following the cochrane handbook [22].
discrepancies were resolved by consensus.
2.4. quality assessment
we assessed methodological quality, including the study
design, randomization method, group allocation concealment and exclusion after randomization without consideration of their results. the quality score for concealment of
allocation per the cochrane handbook differentiates between (a) adequate concealment of the allocation, (b)
unclear whether adequate concealment of the allocation, (c)
inadequate concealment of allocation (d) allocation concealment not used [22]. trials scoring a, b and c were
included in this review. the few studies that scored c were
included due to their overall importance to the review.
2.5. analysis
we found the studies to be included in this review to be
extremely heterogeneous and, thus, could not perform a
single meta-analysis. however, it was possible to group trials
into 7 groups:
group 1:
group 2:
group 3:
group 4:
group 5:
group 6:
group 7:

local anesthesia
paracervical block with premedication
analgesia per os only
conscious sedation
ga
ga with premedication
nonpharmacological interventions

data were processed using the revman (cochrane
collaboration, version 5, 2008) software. peto odds ratios
(ors) using a fixed-effects model with 95% confidence
interval (ci) were calculated for all dichotomous outcomes.
weighted mean differences (wmds) using a random-effects
model with 95% cis were used for continuous outcomes. the data from 11-point visual or verbal pain scales
were treated as continuous data to allow comparisons to
10-cm scales.
for the purpose of this review, conscious sedation was
defined as a drug-induced depression of consciousness
during which patients responded purposefully to verbal
commands (spontaneous respiration with no interventions
needed to maintain a patent airway). with deep sedation, the
ability to independently maintain ventilation may be
impaired and patients may require assisted ventilation. ga
was defined as drug-induced loss of consciousness with
patients not arousable, not even by painful stimulus.
frequently, these patients will require assistance in maintaining an open airway, possibly including positive pressure
ventilation. cardiovascular function may be affected [23].
the primary outcome, pain, was assessed at different time
points depending on the type of anesthesia used. with local
anesthesia, pain was usually assessed during and sometimes

after the procedure. in the sedation and ga groups, pain was
assessed postoperatively.
instruments used to assess pain varied: continuous,
dichotomous and categorical. while many studies used an
11-point vas (visual/verbal analog scale), some used a
100-mm vas [24–31]. in order to facilitate comparability, if
possible, the 100-mm vas was converted to an 11-point
vas by dividing the results by 10 [25,26,29,30].
within groups, we organized studies by anesthesia
technique, substance and, within these subgroups, by no
intervention/placebo versus intervention. in most instances,
we chose to create subcategories within an outcome for doses
and route of administration rather than different times of
outcome assessment. side effects were listed as subcategories when deemed appropriate for better overview.
cointerventions were heterogeneous as well, and participants were not randomized to them, which may have affected
the results or introduced bias. due to their heterogeneity, we
did not include them in our data analysis.
if results were only reported as graphs [31–34] or
medians [24,27,28,35,36] only, we could not extract data for
comparisons and only described them. in other studies,
percentages were reported and we calculated the number of
patients based on the total number of participants per group
[15,37,38]. if the mean and the sem were reported, we
calculated the sd using the formula se×square root of
n [39–41]. if the mean and the ci were reported, we calculated the sd using the formula square root of n×(upper
limit−lower limit)/3.92 for 95% ci [42]. some studies
reported categorical outcomes with three groups. if deemed
appropriate, the result groups were dichotomized for
outcomes including pain, side effects or satisfaction to
allow for analysis [24,31,36,40,42]. in case a study
compared more than two groups, we selected two groups
at a time for comparison in revman. we attempted to
contact study authors with missing or unclear data.

3. results
3.1. description of included studies
forty studies [13,15,24–31,33–62] met inclusion criteria
with a total of 5131 participants. based on type of pain
control, they were divided in the following groups.
3.1.1. group 1: local anesthetics, local anesthesia
technique, premedication and paracervical block (table 1)
ten studies [13,25,26,28,42,45,53,60–62] with 1527 participants investigating local anesthesia met inclusion criteria.
only kan et al. [28] compared paracervical block (pcb)
using 1%  xxxd2482xxx  with no pcb. of note, all patients
underwent conscious sedation. dilation was started 5 min
after conscious sedation and 2 min after the pcb. glantz and
shomento [13] compared 14 ml of 1% chloroprocaine with
bacteriostatic saline. other studies compared different local
anesthetics. in 1992, wiebe [60] compared 10 ml 2%

r.m. renner et al. / contraception 81 (2010) 372–388

carbonated lidocaine and 2 mg atropine/50 ml with 2% plain
lidocaine and 2 mg atropine/50 ml. in a study in 1995,
wiebe and rawling [61] added a third arm with 20 ml
0.25%  xxxd383xxx , which was compared to 20 ml 1%
buffered and plain lidocaine. in 1996, wiebe et al. [62]
compared 20 ml 1% with 0.5% lidocaine.
several studies compared different techniques of pcbs,
such as deep versus regular injection of 1% lidocaine
(3 versus 1.5 cm and a total of 16 versus 10 ml) [45] and
lidocaine with atropine (20 ml 1% lidocaine 1–1.5 in. versus
10 ml 2% lidocaine 0.5-in.; atropine 2 mg/50 ml added to
lidocaine) [60].
others studied injection at different sites of the paracervical area (3, 5, 7 and 9 o'clock versus 4 and 8 o'clock)
with 14 ml of either 1% chloroprocaine or bacteriostatic
(0.9% benzyl alcohol) saline [13], or injection of 10 ml 1%
 xxxd2482xxx  at the vaginal vault versus the cervix [28]. of
note, even though some pcbs included injecting local
anesthesia in the anterior or posterior lip of the cervix, in all
other studies the main portion of the local anesthetic was
injected at the vaginal vault around the cervix. phair et al.
[42] studied the effect of no waiting versus waiting for 3–5
min between the injection of 12 ml 1% buffered lidocaine
and dilation. wiebe and rawling [61] had a two-step study;
the first step was about waiting time, but randomization was
not adequate as it was by day of the procedure. the second
step of this study investigated the influence of a slow versus
fast injection.
edelman at al. [25,26] studied the effect of intrauterine
lidocaine 10 ml of 1% and 5 ml of 4% versus placebo given
in addition to the pcb with 10 ml of 1% lidocaine in two
different studies. li et al. [53] compared the topical
application to the cervix (directly and via hegar dilators)
of 10 ml 2%  xxxd2482xxx  jelly with ky jelly.
waiting times between administration of the pcb and
dilation varied between studies. please see tables 1 and 2
for details.
3.1.2. group 2: pcb with premedication (table 1)
three studies [31,59,61] with 434 participants investigated the effect of premedication, such as ibuprofen 600 mg
per os [61], lorazepam 1 mg per os [59] or naproxen sodium
550 mg per os [31] followed by a pcb with 1% lidocaine
(20 ml in ref. [61]).
3.1.3. group 3: analgesia alone (table 2)
one study with 100 participants investigated diclofenac
sodium 50 mg combined with 200 mcg misoprostol versus
misoprostol alone [29]. of note, patients did not receive
a pcb but lorazepam 1 mg sublingually 30 min prior to
the procedure.
since patients were awake during the procedure under
these different local anesthetic techniques, outcomes included pain with dilation, aspiration and post-procedure. some
studies also measured pain with the paracervical/cervical
block application [28].

375

the predominant study instruments used to measure pain
were visual and verbal analogue scales; some 11-point, some
100-mm. additional outcomes were anxiety, satisfaction,
sedation, side effects, difficulty of the procedure and varied
between the studies.
3.1.4. group 4: conscious sedation (table 2)
three studies [27,36,58] with 274 participants investigated conscious sedation. kan et al. [27] compared entonox
(50:50 mixture of nitrous oxide in oxygen) with air after
administering 2 mg midazolam (another 1 mg if sedation
inadequate) and 25 mcg fentanyl iv. patients received
conscious sedation 2 min prior to cervical dilation. in this
study, patients did not receive a pcb. wong et al. [36], on
the other hand, compared conscious sedation with midazolam 2 mg and fentanyl 25 mcg iv with placebo. after the
study medication, they waited 2 min to administer the pcb
and 5 min to start dilation. wells [58] compared a local
cervical block alone with a cervical block combined with
intravenous sedation using diazepam and fentanyl in two of
their four arms.
3.1.5. group 5: ga (table 3)
fourteen studies [15,32,33,37,38,40,41,43,44,49–51,54,55]
with 1812 participants investigated ga (table 3). one of them
compared ga using propofol and alfentanil with conscious
sedation using midazolam 0.1 mg/kg iv, alfentanil 0.01 mg/kg
iv and pcb with 20 ml mepivacaine 20 mg/ml with
adrenaline 0.005 mg/ml [15]. two minutes after conscious
sedation, the pcb was given. in the ga group, patients
breathed 75% nitrous oxide in oxygen spontaneously by mask
and were assisted as needed for dropping oxygen saturation; in
the sedation group, patients breathed spontaneously and were
assisted with oxygen as needed.
hall et al. [46] compared ga using propofol with ga and
pcb combined. ga studies used either fentanyl or alfentanil
as opiates for pain control.
four studies investigated inhalational anesthetics, specifically, halothane [37,40],  xxxd1993xxx  [41] and trichloethylene
[54] and compared them to various sedative/hypnotic agents.
all studies included at least one sedative/hypnotic agent. ten
studies included propofol [15,32,33,38,43,44,49–51,55],
nine studies included a barbiturate (five  xxxd2599xxx 
[40,41,44,50,54], five thiopental [37,43,49–51], four ketamine [37,38,50,55], three benzodiazepine midazolam
[15,38,55] and one etomidate [43]).
in studies with ga, pain was usually assessed postoperatively, either as a dichotomous or a categorical variable.
other outcomes included typical side effects such as pain
with injection, nausea, vomiting, and apnea, various tests of
recovery and time until discharge.
3.1.6. group 6: ga with premedication (table 4)
seven studies [24,30,35,39,47,48,52] with 770 participants investigated the influence of premedication with
various analgesics on postoperative pain after ga (table 4).
most studies included a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (cox);

376

r.m. renner et al. / contraception 81 (2010) 372–388

cox 3 paracetamol [24,47,48], cox 2  xxxd2069xxx  [30],
nonselective cox inhibitor ketoroloac [52], sodium and
potassium diclofenac [52] and  xxxd2508xxx  [48]. other
studies investigated opioids such as nalbuphine [39],
dihydrocodeine [35] and paracetamol with codeine [24]. in
five out of seven studies, ga was achieved with propofol
[24,30,35,47,48]; in one of them  xxxd1993xxx  [39] and in
another  xxxd1844xxx  [30] was added. thiopental was used in
the two other studies [39,52]. all but one [30] included either
fentanyl [39,47,48] or alfentanil [24,35,52] for anesthesia.
3.1.7. group 7: nonpharmacological interventions
four [34,56–58] very different studies with 214
participants investigated nonpharmacological interventions.
in a recent study [34], the effect of hypnosis was
investigated compared to standard care in patients who all
received a pcb. shapiro and cohen [56] compared 3
groups; one control and two treatment arms with selfadministered  xxxd2604xxx  (0.5 volume % with 5 l
oxygen per minute) and stereophonic headphones with
music chosen by patient. a further study compared
provision of sensory information (3-min audio taped
message containing orienting information as well as nine
sensations related to abortion, and identified by over 50% of
women in a previous pilot study) with provision of general
information. they also compared pcb versus pcb plus
intravenous sedation with diazepam and fentanyl [58].
wells [57] compared four groups: (1) attention control
without technique instruction, but advice to use a coping
strategy that worked in a previous painful experience; (2)
relaxation exercise for 10 min prior to the procedure; (3)
guided pleasant imagery (beach or mountain); (4) guided
analgesic imagery. all participants received a pcb.
cointerventions, which at times are options, included
cervical ripening, premedication and anesthesia induction.
the most important ones are included in tables 1 and 2.
3.2. description of excluded studies
twenty-nine studies were excluded for the following
reasons (some met several criteria):
1. the authors did not state gestational age/or included
a higher gestational age than 14 weeks and did not
specify that suction aspiration was performed (5 studies)
2. the procedure was a sharp curettage only (1 study)
3. pain was not assessed at all or only indirectly as the
need for postoperative analgesics (15 studies)
4. inadequate randomization or allocation (9)
3.3. methodological quality of included studies
randomization was described in 25 of the studies; most
often computer randomization. in 16 studies, the authors
stated that they did randomize, but not how this was
performed. the lack of information on randomization and
allocation concealment likely derives from the fact that

many of these publications were from the 1970s, 1980s and
early 1990s.
allocation concealment was adequate in 23 included
studies and unclear in 14 studies. three studies had
inadequate allocation concealment. they had a research
assistant draw up the syringes or used an envelope but did
not designate it as opaque.
blinding. patients were blinded in many studies. the
surgeons and anesthesiologists could not always be blinded
due to the individual study designs, which may have
introduced bias. however, assessors of postoperative outcomes were usually blinded.
follow-up and exclusions. due to the short follow-up
period until discharge after surgery, loss to follow-up did not
occur. in several studies, patients were excluded after inappropriate inclusion; more often, data collection was incomplete. this
made true intention-to-treat analysis more difficult.
3.4. results of studies
3.4.1. group 1: local anesthetics (comparison 1) (table 1)
kan et al. [28] did not observe a difference in pain with
dilation, aspiration or postoperatively when comparing pcb
using  xxxd2482xxx  with no injection in patients with conscious
sedation (only medians reported, n=89). glantz and
shomento [13] found better pain control during injection
(wmd, −0.90; 95% ci, −1.78 to −0.02), aspiration (wmd,
−1.50; 95% ci, −2.45 to −0.55) and postoperatively (wmd,
−1.5; 95% ci, −2.54 to −0.46; n=79) with a 1%
chloroprocaine pcb, injected at either two or four sites,
compared to a bacteriostatic saline pcb. the significant
decrease in pain with injection and aspiration was driven by
the four-site chloroprocaine pcb and not the two-site block.
in turn, the significant decrease in postoperative pain was
driven by the 2-site chloroprocaine pcb.
a pcb with buffered 2% lidocaine achieved more
effective pain control with cervical dilation and at the end
of the procedure than with plain 2% lidocaine (wmd, −0.80;
95% ci, −0.89 to −0.71; wmd, −0.40; 95% ci, −0.49 to
−0.31; n=167) [60]. buffered 1% lidocaine improved pain
with aspiration compared to plain 1% lidocaine (wmd,
−0.96; 95% ci, −1.67 to −0.25; n=124), but not postoperative pain [61]. pain control with aspiration did not differ
when comparing lidocaine 0.5% with 1%  xxxd383xxx  or 1%
lidocaine with 0.25%  xxxd383xxx  [61,62].
3.4.2. local anesthesia technique (comparison 2) (table 1)
deep injection achieved better pain control than regular
injection for cervical dilation and aspiration when combining
the results of two studies with a total of 113 patients (wmd,
−1.64; 95% ci, −3.21 to −0.08 and wmd, −1.00; 95% ci,
−1.09 to −0.91) [45,60].
pain with pcb injection, aspiration and postoperatively
did not differ when comparing a four-site (3–5–7–9 o'clock)
with a two-site (4–8 o'clock) injection [13]. similarly, it did
not differ when comparing a cervical block with  xxxd2482xxx 
injected at 4 and 8 o'clock into the cervix versus the vaginal

r.m. renner et al. / contraception 81 (2010) 372–388

vault in patients with conscious sedation [28]. kan et al. [28]
only reported medians and thus the actual data could not
be abstracted.
waiting 3 min between pcb and dilation improved pain
with cervical dilation (wmd, −0.7; 95% ci, −1.37 to −0.03;
n=194), but not with aspiration or postoperative pain [42]. of
note in the original article, no significant results were
described. since only cis were reported, we calculated
standard deviation as described in the data synthesis section,
and obtained the following results.
fast injection increased pain with application of the pcb
(wmd, 0.62; 95% ci, 0.06–1.18) [61].
a 1% intrauterine lidocaine infusion plus pcb was not more
effective in controlling pain with cervical dilation or aspiration
as compared to pcb with intrauterine placebo, but a 4%
intrauterine lidocaine infusion plus pcb was (wmd, −2.0;
95% ci, −3.29 to −0.71; wmd, −2.8; 95% ci, −3.95 to −1.65;
n=80 each study) [25,26].
topical  xxxd2482xxx  gel compared to ky jelly did not alter
pain with cervical dilation or postoperative pain, but alleviated
pain with aspiration (wmd, −0.87; 95% ci, −1.60 to −0.14;
n=131) [53].
3.4.3. group 2: pcb with premedication (comparison 3)
(table 1)
ibuprofen, 600 mg orally given 30 min preoperatively
improved pain control with aspiration and postoperatively
compared to placebo (wmd, −0.78; 95% ci, −1.52 to
−0.04; wmd −0.93; 95% ci, −1.62 to −0.24; n=193) [61],
while 1 mg oral lorazepam, given 1 h preoperatively, did not
make a difference [59]. naproxen, given 1–2 h preoperatively, decreased pain compared to placebo (max pain during
procedure, p≤0.001; 15 min postoperatively, p≤0.0001;
30 min postoperatively, p≤0.002) [31]. respective values
for naproxen versus no drug were p≤0.001 with abortion and
p=0.059 30 min postoperatively.
3.4.4. additional outcomes and sub-analysis results
reported in studies for comparisons 1, 2 and 3
lorazepam received per patient request did not affect pain
in patients undergoing the procedure with a pcb [60,61]. it
also did not significantly impact anxiety in an rct [59].
sub-analysis for nulliparity versus multiparity was
performed and showed significantly lower pain scores with
multiparity on arrival in the or, with cervical manipulation/
dilation and overall intraoperatively. multiparous women
were significantly more satisfied; type of anesthesia did not
alter satisfaction [53].
many studies did not study patient satisfaction, but in
those that did, satisfaction was high in both study arms
[25,26,28,42].
3.4.5. group 3: analgesia alone (comparison 4) (table 2)
one study investigated diclofenac sodium 50 mg, given
4 h preoperatively, combined with 200 mcg misoprostol
compared to misoprostol alone in the absence of a pcb and
did not find differences in pain control with aspiration or

377

postoperatively, or with acceptability of pain control [29]. if
broken down into nulliparous and multiparous, there was
significantly less pain with diclofenac sodium in multiparous
women during the procedure [mean 58 (sd 27) versus mean
63(sd 27)).
3.4.6. group 4: conscious sedation (comparison 5) (table 2)
pain with aspiration and 1 h postoperatively did not differ
when comparing entonox (50:50 mixture of nitrous oxide in
oxygen) with air when added to conscious sedation with
midazolam and fentanyl [27]. only median and 95% ci were
reported. anxiety, satisfaction level as well as side effects
(nausea, dizziness, dry mouth and drowsiness) did not
significantly vary between groups [27].
while pain with aspiration and postoperatively did not
differ comparing conscious sedation using midazolam 2 mg
and fentanyl 25 mcg iv with placebo after administering a
pcb to all participants (only medians were reported),
satisfaction was higher with conscious sedation (peto or,
3.69; 95% ci, 1.63–8.36; n=100) [36]. no difference was
observed in sedation. postoperatively, more dizziness
(p=0.015) and drowsiness (pb0.001) were noted in the
conscious sedation group. multiple regression showed that
sedation (decreased, p=0.008) and gestational age (increased, p=0.024) affected pain [36]. a second study
compared pcb and conscious iv sedation using diazepam
and fentanyl with pcb alone [58]. in this study, which does
not report sds, women with iv sedation reported less pain
(mean, 4.54 versus 6.30; p=0.003) (f(1.8)=9.40) n=84).
pain intensity further correlated with subjective (r=.74,
pn0.001) and behavioral distress (r=.54, pb0.001) [58].
3.4.7. group 5: ga (comparison 6) (table 3)
3.4.7.1. inhalation anesthetics. four studies included
inhalation anesthetics [37,40,41,54]. halothane did not
change postoperatively reported pain compared to alfentanil when added to  xxxd2599xxx  [40]. adding halothane,
 xxxd1993xxx  or fentanyl to thiopental did not affect
postoperative pain [37]. trichlorethylene did not change
pain control compared to  xxxd2599xxx  [54].  xxxd1993xxx 
compared to fentanyl did not affect pain when added to
 xxxd2599xxx  [41].
3.4.7.1.1. side effects of inhalation anesthetics. higher
blood loss was noted with inhalation anesthetics, such as
 xxxd1993xxx  [41] and halothane [40] per reported study results.
since no ci was given, we could not recalculate this. data on
nausea and vomiting were controversial; less with halothane
compared to fentanyl [40], more with  xxxd1993xxx  compared to
fentanyl [41] and no difference with trichlorethylene [54].
halothane anesthesia was associated with more cough
compared to alfentanil given for maintenance after  xxxd2599xxx  induction. however, halothane was associated with
less limb movement. since only ranges were given, we could
not recalculate the statistics [40]. laryngospasm, pain on
induction and intraoperative muscle movement did not differ

between trichloethylene and total iv anesthesia [54]. severe
anesthesia complications, as well as apnea [40], did not differ
[37,40,41]. recovery time after halothane was longer
compared to alfentanil (wmd, 7.6; 95% ci, 5.71–9.49;
n=66) [40], while  xxxd1993xxx  and fentanyl did not differ [41].
memory function as part of the recovery testing did not differ
between groups [54]. anesthesia with volatile agents was
considered safe and reliable [37].
3.4.7.2. sedatives, hypnotics and opiates. ten studies
included propofol. postoperative pain did not differ
comparing propofol with etomidate [43]. in a meta-analysis
of three studies with 350 patients comparing propofol and
thiopental, no differences in postoperative pain were
measured regardless of adding fentanyl or alfentanil
[43,50,51]. propofol was associated with decreased postoperative pain compared to  xxxd2599xxx  (peto or, 0.28; 95%
ci, 0.10–0.80; n=100) [50]. however, boysen et al. [44]
showed a trend towards the reverse with more postoperative
pain in the proprofol group. combining the results of these
two studies cancelled out the effect and no significant
difference was found between  xxxd2599xxx  and proprofol
for postoperative pain [44,50].
midazolam and propofol when added to fentanyl did not
differ in reported postoperative pain [55].
combination of propofol and alfentanil achieved better
postoperative pain control compared to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine
and 0.25 mg/kg midazolam (peto or, 0.18; 95% ci, 0.07–
0.47; n=100); the trend when using 1 mg/kg ketamine and
0.1 mg/kg midazolam was not significant [38]. ketamine
was associated with more postoperative pain than fentanyl
when added to propofol (peto or, 7.13; 95% ci, 2.99–17.0;
n=100) [50]. even though rossi et al. [55] did not confirm
this, the association remained significant in the meta-analysis
(peto or, 4.66; 95% ci, 2.16–10.06; n=180).
adding alfentanil to propofol reduced postoperative pain
(peto or, 0.16; 95% ci, 0.06–0.40; n=100) [38]. however,
in the study of jakobsson et al. [49], adding alfentanil to
propofol did not change pain over placebo plus propofol, but
adding fentanyl did (peto or 0.23 95% ci 0.11 to 0.51;
n=208). combining the results from the two studies of
jakobsson et al. [50,51], the alfentanil/propofol combination
was less effective for postoperative pain, then fentanyl/
propofol (peto or, 1.96; 95% ci, 1.07–3.6; n=210) [49,51].
in the arm with thiopental, pain did not differ [51]. at 30 min
postoperatively, pain was less in the fentanyl (pb0.05) and
alfentanil (pb0.01) group compared to placebo [33]. pain
intensity was equal among the groups at 120 and 180 min.
3.4.7.3. side effects of sedatives, hypnotics and opiates.
increased pain with injection was associated with propofol
and etomidate compared to thiopental [43] and ketamine
[38]. adding alfentanil to propofol decreased this pain [38].
propofol was associated with increased apnea compared to
etomidate but not thiopental or  xxxd2599xxx  [43,44]. muscle
movement was increased with etomidate as compared to

381

propofol, as well as thiopental [43] and increased with
 xxxd2599xxx  as compared to propofol [44]. intraoperative
movement was further increased with thiopental and fentanyl
compared to ketamine and diazepam as well as thiopental
and halothane [37]. nausea was decreased with propofol
compared to  xxxd2599xxx  in one study [50], but not in
another [44]. it was also decreased with thiopental and
fentanyl compared to ketamine and diazepam [37]. vomiting
was decreased with propofol and alfentanil compared to
ketamine and midazolam [38]. dreams were increased with
ketamine compared to other sedative hypnotics [50].
nausea, vomiting, laryngospasm and overall complications did not differ when comparing alfentanil or fentanyl
with each other or placebo [33,49]. propofol induction dose
was significantly lower in the alfentanil group compared to
fentanyl (pb0.05; only medians given). the total propofol
dose required, and the number of people moving to surgical
stimulus, was significantly lower in both the fentanyl and
alfentanil groups as compared to the normal saline (ns)
control group (pb0.01), while recovery measures were
improved in the alfentanil group as compared to the ns
control group [33]. time to discharge was shorter after
propofol compared to thiopental in the meta-analysis of
two studies (wmd, −14.69; 95% ci, −24.95 to −4.43;
n=200) [50,51]. adding an opioid compared to placebo did
not alter the time [49]. recovery was faster in propofol/
fentanyl group compared to ketamine/fentanyl and fentanyl/
midazolam as assessed per steward score [55]. speed
and quality of psychomotor and sensory tests were significantly better in the propofol groups compared to the ketamine
groups [38], as it was in the thiopentane group compared to
ketamine [37].
per study reports, overall, propofol was associated with a
better recovery compared to etomidate and thiopental [43],
and a similar recovery compared to  xxxd2599xxx  [44]. pain
significantly correlated to prolonged time until hospital
discharge [49].
3.4.7.4. pcb added to ga. one study investigated if a
pcb added to ga altered postoperative pain control [32].
pain, intraoperative propofol use and postoperative pain
medication consumption did not change, nor did nausea or
time until discharge.
3.4.7.5. conscious sedation with ga. one study with 59
patients directly compared conscious sedation with ga [15].
with conscious sedation combined with a pcb, pain with
dilation and aspiration was higher as assessed by the
anesthesiologist (peto or, 14.77; 95% ci, 4.91–44.38,
and peto or, 7.47; 95% ci, 2.2–25.36). however,
postoperatively reported pain was decreased (wmd,
−1.00; 95% ci, −1.77 to −0.23). risk for apnea was reduced
with conscious sedation (peto or, 0.10; 95% ci, 0.02–
0.46), and duration of sleep was shorter (wmd, −9.5; 95%
ci, −11.5 to −7.5). except for better p-deletion score (a test

[47]. even when adding codeine to the paracetamol
suppository and giving it 1 h preoperatively, pain did not
improve compared to placebo [24]. the nonselective cox
inhibitor  xxxd2508xxx  significantly decreased postoperative
pain compared to paracetamol dosed orally (peto or, 0.36;
95% ci, 0.17–0.78; n=140), which in turn did not change
pain compared to placebo. all test drugs were given 1
h before anesthesia [48]. diclofenac im and ketorolac im
both decreased postoperative pain compared to nacl when
given 10–20 min before the anesthesia (peto or, 0.37; 95%
ci, 0.14–0.92, and peto or, 0.32; 95% ci, 0.12–0.81;
n=100) [52] and did not differ when compared to each other.

four very different studies investigated nonpharmacological interventions. in patients with a pcb, hypnosis did not
did not change the level of comfort during the procedure
compared to standard care; however, it decreased the
requests for nitrous oxide (peto or, 0.12; 95% ci, 0.03–
0.54) [34]. listening to stereo music compared to selfadministration of  xxxd2604xxx  decreased pain with
aspiration (peto or, 0.17; 95% ci, 0.04–0.63; n=98) [56].
providing sensory (3-min audiotaped message containing
orienting information as well as nine sensations related to
abortion and identified by over 50% of women in a previous
pilot study) compared to general information did not affect
procedural pain or distress [60]. relaxation exercise did not
change procedural or postoperative pain compared to
pleasant or analgesic imagery, or a control group [57].
4. discussion
4.1. summary of main results
various methods of pain control for first-trimester
surgical abortion have been studied including local anesthesia, iv sedation, ga and some forms of nonpharmacological
pain control. many of them have been found to effectively
decrease pain compared to placebo or other pain management strategies during and after the procedure while being
safe and satisfactory to patients.
data on the effect of a pcb are heterogeneous and very
limited. the only study that compared a pcb to no pcb did
not show a benefit of the pcb [28]. this result is limited by
the small number of participants (n=89) and the fact that all
patients received conscious sedation with 2 mg midazolam
iv and 25 mcg fentanyl iv.
while one small study showed a pain reduction with
injection and aspiration when using 1% chloroprocaine
compared to normal saline for a four-site pcb, this effect
was not noted for a two-site pcb except for postoperative
pain. additionally, there was no significant difference when
two- and four-site pcb were directly compared [13]. pain
with cervical dilation was improved with a pcb using
carbonated lidocaine compared to noncarbonated [60], deep
injection of the paracervical block [45,60], waiting 3 min
between pcb and dilation [42], and with adding a 4%
intrauterine lidocaine infusion to pcb [26]. all but waiting 3
min also decreased pain with aspiration [26,42,45,60,61].
fast injection increased pain with application of the pcb
[61]. premedication with ibuprofen and naproxen (pb0.001)
improved intra- and postoperative pain [31,61]. the addition
of conscious iv sedation using diazepam and fentanyl to

385

pcb decreased pain with the procedure [58]. adding a pcb
to ga has not been shown to reduce intraoperative anesthetic
needs or postoperative pain [32]. conscious sedation
combined with pcb does not achieve the same pain control
as ga during the procedure, but improved postoperative
pain control [15].
in regard to ga, a shift from inhalational anesthetics to
sedatives and hypnotics has decreased procedure-related
blood loss. propofol has been shown to be superior to
ketamine in multiple studies and shortened time until
discharge compared to some other hypnotics. adding
opioids or im cox inhibitors to ga has been found to
be beneficial for postoperative pain, and opioids have
decreased ga needs. no major complications were
observed in any study.
4.2. overall completeness evidence
various countries, decades of years, settings in which the
procedure was provided and pain management options have
been represented by the included studies. methods of pain
control varied widely and were often combined regimens. in
order to synthesize the data, we grouped the included trials as
mentioned previously. trials were too heterogeneous
regarding combination of medications, doses and routes of
administration to be combined in a large meta-analysis.
therefore, we focused on the primary outcome of pain and
were unable to draw firm conclusion on side effects or
complications. in addition, the nature of ga, which achieves
complete pain control during the surgery, challenges the
ability to compare it to any other form of anesthesia. pain
during deep conscious sedation and ga can only be assessed
by an observer and cannot be patient-reported, which
decreases comparability to other forms of anesthesia.
4.3. quality of evidence
randomization and allocation concealment were not
specified in one third and one half of the studies, respectively. this likely derives from the fact that many publications were from the 1970s to early 1990s. three studies
[47,60,62] had inadequate allocation concealment, but
were included due to their overall importance to the review.
several studies reported incomplete data, and some of the
ga literature did not contain detailed gynecologic information (e.g., type of procedure, sharp curettage versus suction).
not all authors could be successfully contacted to obtain
missing information.
some studies had statistically significant results; however, they only detected a small change in pain (wmd b1)
[30,42,45,53,60,61] or did not measure the amount in pain
reduction they had determined in their power calculations
(i.e., ref. [42]). of note, phair et al. [42] did not originally
report any statistically significant results, but in our
reanalysis, pain with dilation was reduced. this raises the
questions of quality of evidence and points out that clinically
significant pain reduction is hard to determine.

5. conclusion
many patients still find first-trimester surgical abortion
extremely uncomfortable due to pain with cervical dilation
and aspiration, unless given ga. given how widely pcb is
used, the paucity of data supporting the benefit of a pcb as
shown in this review is surprising and concerning. although
pcb appears relatively safe, no strong data exist regarding
its effectiveness for pain control.
severe complications of anesthetics are rare; therefore,
none of the included studies were powered to detect these.
due to short follow-up, delayed side effects may have been
missed. however, most of the medications studied do not
have a long half-life.
recommendations by the who on safe abortion [1] as
well as by the royal college of obstetricians and
gynaecologists [63] favor local/iv sedation over ga.
these recommendations are likely based on data from the
1970 to 1980s. as the overall mortality from legally induced
abortions has decreased since the 1970s from 4.1 in 100,000
to 0.7 in the united states, the percentage mortality related to
ga increased from 7.7% to 29.4% [6]. between 1988 and
1997, deaths attributed to any anesthesia decreased to 22%
[4]. however, other large reviews of abortions have not
shown a significant difference in major complications
between local and ga [3,64]. data from the closed claims
project of the american society of anesthesiologists has
shown a decrease in the percentage of death and brain
damage claims related to respiratory events between the
period 1970–1979 and the period 1990–1994 from 56% to
39% [65]. this is thought to be due to improved monitoring
including pulse oximetry and capnography [65]. we lack an
up-to-date observational data summary on risks of ga in
first-trimester surgical abortions.
in any case, in order to prevent complications, the
provider must have a profound respect for the continuum
from anxiolysis to unconsciousness. it is imperative that
patients be monitored appropriately by qualified personnel
who are knowledgeable about pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and who are experienced in airway management resuscitation [23]. therefore, the setting in which
abortions take place strongly affects available resources and
risks from anesthesia.
in the light of these findings, factors such as women's
preference, medical risk factors for anesthesia complications,
setting and resource availability should be considered when
choosing a method of pain control.
future studies should aim for using the same outcomes
and study instruments to measure pain in order to increase
comparability. in order to establish whether pcb is effective
or not, a well-designed study is needed, comparing pcb to a
no treatment arm rather than placebo. more studies should
try to compare local anesthesia with conscious sedation and
ga regarding pain during and after the procedure as well as
regarding side effects, required doses of ga, time to
discharge and satisfaction. the nature of ga, which achieves

complete pain control during the surgery, challenges direct
comparison to any other form of anesthesia.
newer observational data on risks of ga will further help
to improve its adequate risk perception. such data may revise
current recommendations.
