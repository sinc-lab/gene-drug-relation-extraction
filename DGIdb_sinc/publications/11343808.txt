background. albendazole (abz) is an antiparasitic drug used for the treatment of several
helminthiases. after its oral administration, this compound is metabolized to sulfoxide
(soabz) and sulfone (so2abz), soabz being the active metabolite. the antiparasitic
activity of abz has been associated with its capacity to bind with tubulin, altering microtubule formation. although some studies indicate that abz modified microtubule structure in host cells, data concerning the consequences of this phenomenon in human cells
are scant.
methods. in this study we evaluated the effects of abz and its metabolites on cell proliferation, as well as on the frequency of micronucleated cells in cultured human lymphocytes.
results. abz and soabz arrested cell proliferation in metaphase and increased the frequency of micronuclei in treated lymphocytes. contrariwise, so2abz, the inactive metabolite, did not produce any significant effect.
conclusions. the formation of micronuclei may ultimately result in aneuploidy induction, an effect that could have severe consequences in humans. however, the doses of
abz and soabz at which these effects were observed are several orders of magnitude
higher than those found in the plasma of treated individuals. because there are other
mechanisms by which aneuploidy can be induced at even lower doses than micronuclei,
i.e., chromosome nondisjunction, it is necessary to evaluate this effect in exposed
individuals. © 2001 imss. published by elsevier science inc.

introduction
helminthiases are considered among the most common human diseases, affecting the productivity and health of more
than 10% of the world population (1). albendazole (abz)
is a benzimidazole compound frequently used for the treatment of several helminthiases due to its broad antiparasitic
activity, efficacy, and low toxicity (2⫺4). furthermore, this

drug has also been utilized in massive programs focused on
decreasing the morbidity and mortality rates of parasitic diseases among infants in developing countries (5).
albendazole is metabolized almost completely into sulfoxide (soabz) and sulfone (so2abz) metabolites after
oral ingestion, abz oxidation being important for its anthelmintic activity and toxicity (6⫺10). the mechanism by
which abz kills parasites has been speculated to be its capacity to bind tubulin, inhibiting microtubule formation (9).
this mechanism could also be related to some of the in vitro
effects of abz such as alterations of cell proliferation and
differentiation, as well as certain side effects observed in individuals treated with abz, e.g., leukopenia, hair loss, and

teratogenesis (11,12). inhibition of tubulin polymerization
by abz might also influence other processes in host cells,
such as chromosome segregation, which could have severe
long-term side effects. in this study, we evaluated the in
vitro cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of abz and its metabolites in human lymphocytes. genotoxicity was analyzed as
the frequency of micronucleated cells, because micronuclei
(mn) can be formed by the loss of either acentric chromosome fragments or whole chromosomes (13). thus, it is
possible to evaluate dna damage induced both by direct
acting compounds and by substances that interfere with
chromosome segregation. cytotoxicity was evaluated by the
frequency of cells that divided once, twice, and three or
more times in cultures, a methodology previously validated
in our laboratory (14).

and cultures were incubated (37⬚c) for 72 h. test substances as well as cytochalasin-b (6 ␮g/ml, sigma) were
administered for the final 24 h (13). cells were fixed with
methanol-acetic acid (3:1) and carefully dropped onto cold
glass slides to avoid membrane destruction. after 24 h,
slides were stained with wright’s colorant for microscopic
evaluation. the frequency of micronucleated cells was analyzed in 1,000 binucleated cells according to the criteria described in other studies (18).
statistical methods. anova test was used to analyze the
statistical significance of results. results from treated cultures
were compared to those observed in dmso control. p values
equal to or lower than 0.05 were considered significant.
results

materials and methods
donors. blood samples were obtained from two healthy
men (29 and 31 years old) who had not taken any drugs for
at least 15 days prior to blood extraction.
evaluation of lymphocyte proliferation. peripheral blood
samples (0.5 ml) were cultured in rpmi-1640 medium
(6 ml, sigma, st. louis, mo, usa) supplemented with
non-essential amino acids and glutamine (1%, gibco, rockville, md, usa). lymphocyte division was stimulated by
phytohemagglutinin (pha; 0.2 ml, gibco); bromodeoxyuridine (sigma) was added in darkness, from the beginning
of culture, in a final concentration of 32 ␮m. cultures were
incubated at 37⬚c for 72 h and treated with abz, soabz,
or so2abz dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) for the
final 24 h. we tested two concentrations similar to those
found in serum from treated patients (10⫺7 and 10⫺6 m), as
well as two higher concentrations (10⫺5 and 10⫺4 m) (4,
15⫺16). cultures were further incubated for 24 h, and  xxxd1831xxx  was added for the final 2 h (0.2 ␮g/ml, gibco). cells
were centrifuged (1,200 rpm/10 min), the supernatant was
extracted, and 5 ml of kcl (0.075 m) was added and allowed to stand for 30 min. cells were fixed with a methanol-acetic acid solution (3:1) and dropped onto cold glass
slides. slides were flame-dried and stained with fluorescence plus giemsa sister-chromatid differential method
(17). the mitotic index (mi) was calculated as the number
of metaphases per 1,000 cells. the cell proliferation kinetic
(cpk) was evaluated in 100 consecutive metaphases as the
frequency of cells that divided once (m-1), twice, and three
or more times in culture according to their sister chromatid
color pattern.
evaluation of micronuclei frequency. peripheral blood
(0.5 ml) was cultivated in 6.3 ml rpmi-1640 culture medium (sigma) supplemented with non-essential amino acids
(gibco) and glutamine (sigma). pha was added (0.2 ml)

figure 1 shows the effects of abz and its metabolites on
the mi of pha-stimulated human lymphocytes. while abz
induced a significant increase in this parameter at 1 ␮m and
higher doses (p ⬍0.01), soabz increased the mi only at
the highest concentrations: 10 and 100 ␮m (p ⬍0.01). to
the contrary, so2abz, the inactive metabolite, did not significantly affect the mi at any concentration (p ⬎0.05). the
frequency of cells that performed one mitotic division (m1
cells, figure 2) increased in cultures treated with abz
(1⫺100 ␮m, p ⬍0.01) and with soabz (100 ␮m, p ⬍
0.01), but not with so2abz, which only slightly augmented

the frequency of m1 cells at the highest concentration (p ⫽
0.05). similarly, the evaluation of mn frequency (figure 3)
indicated a significant elevation of the number of micronucleated cells in cultures treated with abz (10⫺100 ␮m,
p ⬍0.05) and soabz (100 ␮m; p ⬍0.05), but not with
so2abz.
discussion
our results show that both abz and its active metabolite,
soabz, increased the mi and the frequency of cells that divided only once in culture, indicating a cell cycle arrest in
metaphase. on the other hand, the evaluation of the frequency of micronucleated cells indicated that abz and
soabz increased the proportion of cells with mn. however, the capacities of abz to inhibit cell proliferation as
well as to induce mn were significantly higher than those
observed with soabz, an effect that could be related to the
higher affinity of abz for tubulin dimers, as reported for other
cell systems (19⫺24). nevertheless, the frequency of cells
with mn induced by 100 ␮m of soabz was four times
higher than its control. because abz and soabz inhibit
microtubule formation, the induced mn may contain whole
chromosomes; however, we cannot dismiss a clastogenic effect by abz or soabz in that it is known that mn can be
formed either by chromosome fragments or by whole chro-

mosomes (13,25). further experiments should be performed
to discriminate mn containing whole chromosomes, e.g.,
by the use of centromere/telomere-specific dna probes.
the molecular mechanisms by which inhibition of microtubule polymerization promotes cell cycle delay and mn
formation are unclear. one possible explanation that should
be explored is the inactivation of the serial events that lead
to metaphase progression as a result of negative signals produced by some of the components of the mitotic machinery,
such as the kinetochores. for instance,  xxxd2745xxx , another
benzimidazole compound, is known to induce a delay on
chromosome alignment to the metaphase plate in hela
cells. the presence of the protein  xxxg2169xxx  of the kinetochores of unaligned chromosomes suggests that this molecule could be a negative signal for cell cycle progression
(26,27).
although our results showed that both abz and soabz
induced the formation of mn in cultured peripheral blood
lymphocytes, the doses at which this effect was observed
were two orders of magnitude higher than serum concentrations of soabz reported in patients treated with abz
(4,15,16). therefore, the dna damage found in vitro could
only have biological significance in individuals with hepatic
injury in whom abz and soabz serum concentrations can
be elevated (28). it is important to point out that further experiments should evaluate other mechanisms capable of inducing aneuploidy, the final consequence of mn formation,

such as chromosome nondisjunction, which occurs more
frequently and at doses even lower than those inducing mn
(29–31).
the effectiveness of abz for the treatment and prevention of helminthiasis is unquestionable; however, one must
bear in mind that its indiscriminate use could have severe
consequences in relation to human health not only due to its
potential negative effects in sensitive individuals but also
due to the emergence of abz-resistant species (32). these,
in turn, could exert future problems for public health.
