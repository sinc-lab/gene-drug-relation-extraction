summary
the  xxxg147xxx  pathway results in the formation of leukotrienes, including
leukotriene b4 (ltb4), 5-oxo-6e,8z,11z,14z-eicosatetranoic acid and the cysteinyl
leukotrienes (ltc4, ltd4 and lte4) and activates all four leukotriene receptors,
blt1, blt2,  xxxg599xxx  and cyslt2.  xxxd3554xxx  is the only commercially available inhibitor
of the  xxxg147xxx  pathway. in a number of clinical trials,  xxxd3554xxx  has been
shown to improve airway function and inflammation, asthma symptom control and
quality of life in asthmatics. given the important role that leukotrienes play in airway inflammation,  xxxd3554xxx  provides an additional therapeutic option in the management of chronic, persistent asthma, particularly those asthmatics with more
severe disease. in addition,  xxxd3554xxx  has shown promise in a number of other conditions, including upper airway inflammatory conditions, dermatological disease
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. the development of new formulations,
including a controlled release tablet formulation for b.i.d. dosing and an intravenous preparation for acute asthma exacerbations may enhance clinical utility and
expand therapeutic indications.

introduction
asthma is a chronic disease of the airways characterised by heterogeneous inflammation and variable
responses to multiple therapies. the goals of asthma
pharmacological therapy are to maintain the best
possible asthma control while optimising safety and
efficacy (1). despite the availability of controller
agents, such as oral corticosteroids (ocs), inhaled
steroids (ics) and long-acting beta-adrenergic receptor agonists (labas), there remains an unmet therapeutic need in significant numbers of asthmatics.
recent studies suggest that up to 31% of asthmatics
remain uncontrolled despite access to specialty care,
the availability of a variety of commercially available
therapies and treatment with high doses of inhaled
or oral steroids and the fixed-dose combination of a
long-acting bronchodilator and an inhaled steroid
(2,3). furthermore, the clinical response to increasing
the dose of ics is variable, suggesting that there is a
‘rule of thirds’ in which one-third of asthmatics have
a marked response to steroid therapy, one-third have
modest improvement and one-third have minimal
improvement (4,5). there is also growing evidence
that glucocorticoid-insensitive asthma may have
important implications for the pathogenesis of

asthma and increased morbidity (6). multiple reports
suggest pathological and inflammatory changes in
small airways and alveolar attachments in asthma,
particularly severe asthma, and most inhaled medications are unlikely to reach the lung periphery in high
amounts, resulting in inadequate drug delivery to the
small or distal airways (7,8). additionally, recent evidence suggests that polymorphisms on the b2-adrenergic receptor are associated with diminished
responses to both short and long-acting b2-agonists
(9,10).
leukotrienes are important mediators in asthma
pathogenesis (11–16) and  xxxg147xxx  ( xxxg147xxx )
products have been shown to be increased in all
severities of asthma, despite treatment with inhaled
and ocs (17–20). recent reports have suggested that
neutrophils may play an important role in asthma,
particularly severe and difficult-to-treat populations
(8,18,21). neutrophilic inflammation, which has been
shown to be increased in multiple asthma phenotypes, including severe, acute, fatal, sudden-onset,
occupational and smoking asthmatics with a corresponding increase in neutrophil numbers and
activation states, is resistant to the effects of
corticosteroids (18,21,22,24–26). corticosteroids have
been reported to suppress neutrophil apoptosis and

their use may increase neutrophil numbers (21,27–
28). ltb4, a potent neutrophil chemoattractant, is
increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) fluid,
sputum and tissue of severe asthmatics and the levels
remain high despite corticosteroid therapy
(8,17,19,22).
the relative insensitivity of the  xxxg147xxx  pathway to
corticosteroid therapy, increased  xxxg147xxx  products in
asthmatic inflammation and increased neutrophilic
inflammation support the rationale of  xxxd3554xxx  as an
additional approach to anti-inflammatory therapy for
the treatment of the multiple phenotypes seen in
chronic asthma.

 xxxg147xxx  pathway
the  xxxg147xxx  pathway, which results in the production
of leukotrienes, was discovered in the 1970s by borgeat and samuelsson (29,30). leukotrienes play an
important role in the clinical course of asthma, the
physiological changes seen in asthma and the pathogenesis of the disease (31,32). these biological compounds produce bronchoconstriction and mediate
increased microvascular permeability, increased
mucus secretion, goblet cell hyperplasia, smooth
muscle hypertrophy and inflammatory cellular infiltration (33). leukotrienes are produced by multiple
inflammatory cells, particularly mast cells, basophils,
eosinophils, neutrophils and macrophages; all of
which have been implicated in asthma. increased
asthma disease severity is associated with increased

numbers and activities of neutrophils, eosinophils
and mast cells, all rich sources of leukotrienes
(13,34–41).

leukotriene formation by  xxxg147xxx 
leukotrienes are generated from  xxxd208xxx 
(aa) which must be released from membrane phospholipids upon cellular activation. cellular activation
by immune complexes, bacterial peptides and other
stimuli elicit a sequence of events that include cytosolic  xxxg1759xxx  (cpla2) and  xxxg147xxx  translocation to the nuclear envelope (15). cytosolic
 xxxg1759xxx  selectively hydrolyses aa from
phospholipids from the nuclear envelope, causing a
release of aa.  xxxd208xxx  binds to  xxxg147xxx  activating protein (flap), an  xxxd208xxx 
transfer protein, in the nuclear envelope and the
aa–flap complex is presented to  xxxg147xxx .  xxxg147xxx 
converts aa to 5s-hydroxyperoxy-6e, 8z,11z,14zeicosatetranoic acid (5-hpete) which is then converted to 5s-hydroxy-6e,8z,11z,14z-eicosatetranoic
acid (5-hete) and further converted to 5-oxo6e,8z,11z,14z-eicosatetranoic acid (5-oxo-ete).
5-hpete can also be converted to the unstable intermediate, leukotriene a4 ( xxxg1346xxx ).  xxxg1346xxx  is converted to
leukotriene b4 (ltb4) by cytosolic  xxxg1346xxx  hydrolase or
to leukotriene c4 (ltc4) by perinuclear ltc4
synthase. ltc4 undergoes extracellular metabolism
to yield leukotriene d4 (ltd4) and leukotriene e4
(lte4) (15,42) (figure 1).

 xxxd3554xxx :  xxxg147xxx  pathway inhibition

leukotriene b4
leukotriene b4, one of the major eicosanoids of the
 xxxg147xxx  pathway, is a potent chemoattractant for multiple inflammatory cells, including effector cd8+ t
cells (teff), eosinophils and neutrophils (17,43).
ltb4 is the major  xxxg147xxx  product of neutrophils,
monocytes and alveolar macrophages. ltb4 stimulates leucocyte chemotaxis, chemokinesis and vascular endothelium adherence, delays neutrophil
apoptosis and prolongs neutrophil survival. recent
studies in murine models of inflammation have
demonstrated that mast cells produce ltb4 following sensitisation and challenge, leading to the
migration of cd8+ teff cells into the airways,
increased interleukin 13 (il-13) production and
enhanced airway reactivity. these events are mediated by the high-affinity ltb4 receptor, blt1, and
are dependent upon the mast cell high affinity
immunoglobulin e (ige) receptor (fc€r1). in
humans, bal fluid levels of ltb4 have been demonstrated to correlate with disease severity and
ltb4 levels remain high in the bal of severe persistent asthmatics despite high-dose oral steroid use
(11). a subset of cd8+ teff/blt1+/il-13+ cells
have been identified in bal fluid of asthmatics,
suggesting the therapeutic potential for targeting the
ltb4-specific components of the  xxxg147xxx  pathway that
are ige-independent (44–46).

5-hete and 5-oxo-ete
another major  xxxg147xxx  product is 5-hete, which has
been recently shown to be an important mediator in
asthma. 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid is the
aa metabolite formed by the oxidation of 5-hete,
and this metabolite is a potent chemoattractant for
neutrophils and eosinophils. among lipid mediators,
5-oxo-ete is the strongest chemoattractant for eosinophils, with a potency 30 times greater than the
chemoattractant properties of the cysteinyl leukotrienes in vitro. the actions of 5-oxo-ete are mediated
by its receptor, oxe, which is highly expressed by
eosinophils, neutrophils and monocytes. the impact
of inhibiting 5-oxo-ete and mediating its effects on
a variety of cells, particularly eosinophils and neutrophils, is an area of active research in asthmatic
inflammation (42).

cysteinyl leukotrienes
the cysteinyl leukotrienes, ltc4, ltd4 and lte4,
are potent constrictors of airway smooth muscle.
additional cysteinyl leukotriene (cyslt) effects
include increased vascular permeability, edema,
decreased mucocilliary clearance and mucus hypersecretion. the cyslts are synthesised by mast cells and

alveolar macrophages, are potent eosinophil chemattractants as well as autocrine and paracrine mediators of asthmatic inflammation (47). the cyslts
induce physiological effects via two receptors, the
 xxxg599xxx  and cyslt2 receptors. while most of the
effects of leukotrienes with relevance to asthma are
mediated by activation of the  xxxg599xxx , the
cyslt2 receptor may be a relevant target for treatment in asthma and other inflammatory diseases
(47).

clinical pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics of  xxxg147xxx  inhibition
with  xxxd3554xxx 
 xxxd3554xxx , a benzothiophene  xxxd2304xxx , was the
first oral inhibitor of  xxxg147xxx  to undergo extensive clinical testing for the treatment of asthma (37).  xxxd3554xxx  has the chemical name (±)-1-(1-benzo[b]thien2-ylethyl)- xxxd2304xxx  and the following chemical
structure:

ch3
s

ho

nh2

n
o

 xxxd3554xxx  has the molecular formula  xxxd3554xxx 
and a molecular weight of 236.29 g/mol.

pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3554xxx 
in humans,  xxxd3554xxx  is rapidly absorbed after oral
administration with a time to maximal concentration
(tmax) of 1.7 ± 0.9 h (mean ± sd) and a mean  xxxd3554xxx  peak level (cmax) of 5.0 ± 2.0 lg/ml for the
600-mg q.i.d. dose (48). after single and multiple
doses, the mean area under the curve (auc) following
600 mg  xxxd3554xxx  administration is 19.2 ± 5.6 lgæh/ml
(48). plasma concentrations of  xxxd3554xxx  are proportional to dose, and steady-state levels are predictable
from single-dose data, indicating no unusual accumulation of the drug following four times a day dosing.
the average apparent oral clearance of  xxxd3554xxx  is
approximately 1.2 l/kg (48).  xxxd3554xxx  is 93% bound to
plasma proteins with albumin as the primary plasma
binding protein (88% bound) and a1-acid glycoprotein as a more minor binding protein (34% bound)
(48). administration of  xxxd3554xxx  with food resulted in
a small, but statistically significant, increase (27%) in
 xxxd3554xxx  cmax without significant changes in auc or
tmax. therefore,  xxxd3554xxx  can be administered with or
without food (48).

 xxxd3554xxx :  xxxg147xxx  pathway inhibition

 xxxd3554xxx  metabolism

pharmacodynamics of  xxxd3554xxx 

elimination of  xxxd3554xxx  is predominantly via metabolism with a mean terminal half-life of 2.5 h (48).
the activity of  xxxd3554xxx  is primarily because of the
parent drug. studies with radio-labelled drug in
healthy volunteers have demonstrated that 94.5%
and 2.2% of the radio-labelled dose is recovered in
urine and faeces respectively (48). the major urinary
metabolites in humans (approximately 80–90% of
the dose) are the  xxxd3554xxx  glucuronides (48). the
urinary excretion of the inactive n-dehydroxylated
metabolite and unchanged  xxxd3554xxx  each accounted
for < 0.5% of the dose. in vitro studies utilising
human liver microsomes have shown that  xxxd3554xxx 
and its n-dehydroxylated metabolite can also be
oxidatively metabolised by the cytochrome p45 isoenzymes cyp1a2,  xxxg590xxx  and cyp2c9 (37). the
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3554xxx  are essentially the same
in healthy elderly subjects (> 65 years) (23,39,50),
paediatric subjects (8–12 years) (27) as in healthy
younger adults and in males compared with females,
after adjustments for body weight or body surface
area. the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3554xxx  were also
similar between healthy volunteers and in patients
with either mild-to-moderate asthma or rheumatoid
arthritis or subjects with mild, moderate and severe
renal insufficiency. in subjects with renal failure who
required haemodialysis, pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3554xxx 
were not altered by haemodialysis. a very small percentage of the administered  xxxd3554xxx  dose (< 0.5%)
was removed by haemodialysis. therefore, using
dosing adjustment is not necessary in patients with
renal dysfunction or in those undergoing haemodialysis (48).

many studies of the effect of  xxxd3554xxx  on suppression
of  xxxg147xxx  product formation, including ltb4 and the
cysteinyl leukotrienes have been performed. in addition, the specificity of  xxxd3554xxx  in inhibiting the
products of the  xxxg147xxx  pathway was assessed by measuring cyclooxygenase products, including thromboxane b2 (txb2) and  xxxd14xxx  ( xxxg1073xxx ).
 xxxd3554xxx  selectively inhibits the  xxxg147xxx  enzyme. multiple studies have demonstrated that  xxxd3554xxx  produces little or no inhibition of related enzymes, such as
12-lo, 15-lo and cyclooxygenase, at concentrations
of up to 100 lm (51). in an animal model, a
70-mg/kg dose of  xxxd3554xxx  failed to significantly inhibit the formation of the cyclooxygenase product
txb2, demonstrating the in vivo selectivity of  xxxd3554xxx  for leukotriene inhibition. oral doses of  xxxd3554xxx 
also inhibited ex vivo blood ltb4 biosynthesis in the
rat, dog, monkey and sheep. in the dog, an oral dose
of 5 mg/kg provided complete inhibition of ex vivo
leukotriene formation for at least 24 h (51). it is largely suspected that  xxxd3554xxx  does not, therefore,
shunt aa metabolism, possibly because of an incomplete inhibition of  xxxg147xxx  and other compensatory
mechanisms (40).
the ex vivo per cent inhibition of the biosynthesis
of ltb4 in whole blood is directly related to plasma
concentration of  xxxd3554xxx . after oral administration,
peak  xxxd3554xxx  plasma levels occur within 2 h after
administration and are associated with mean ltb4
inhibition of 98% after the first dose in the  xxxd3554xxx 
600 mg group (figure 2). after 13 weeks of measurement, there is a 92% inhibition 2 h postdosing of
600 mg  xxxd3554xxx  (figure 3). the 50% inhibitory con-

dose measurement and 92% for the 13 week measurement
in chronic persistent asthmatics treated with 600 mg q.i.d.
of  xxxd3554xxx  (n ¼ 20).  xxxd3554xxx  peak plasma levels occurred
2–4 h after administration

centration (ic50) for the inhibition of ltb4 in
asthma patients treated with  xxxd3554xxx  is very similar
to that of healthy volunteer subjects; 0.47 and
0.46 mg/ml respectively (figure 2) (48).
improvement in the forced expiratory volume in
one second (fev1) in patients treated with  xxxd3554xxx 
600 mg was immediate, starting within 0.5 h after
first dose. the mean time to achieve maximum per
cent improvement in fev1 was 2–3 h post peak
plasma concentration and maximum ltb4 inhibition. the mean peak inhibition of ltb4 in the
600 mg q.i.d. group (n ¼ 20) was 98% at peak
plasma concentrations. the greatest mean improvements in fev1 coincided with these plasma levels
(figures 2 and 3) (48,52). the ex vivo inhibition of
ltb4 production in whole blood is directly related to
the plasma concentration of  xxxd3554xxx  (figure 2) (48).
in a cold air challenge study, ex vivo ltb4 production in whole blood was reduced by 74% (p £ 0.001)
following a single 800 mg dose of  xxxd3554xxx . in
another study, a single 800 mg of  xxxd3554xxx  inhibited
ltb4 release in whole blood stimulated with calcium
ionophore ex vivo by 92% (p < 0.01) (53). another
bronchoprovocation study in aspirin-sensitive asthmatics,  xxxd3554xxx  600 mg q.i.d. for 1 week decreased
the baseline urinary lte4 excretion by 71%
(p < 0.02) (54). the in vivo activity of  xxxd3554xxx  was
also examined in 10 patients by measuring lte4 in
urine and bal fluid following segmental allergen
challenge. urinary lte4 was reduced by 86% compared with placebo (p < 0.05) 4 h postchallenge.
bal lte4 was similarly reduced by 72% compared
with placebo 24 h after challenge (55). in patients
with nocturnal asthma, ltb4 and cysteinyl leukotrie-

nes in bal fluid were significantly reduced by 38.5%
and 67%, respectively, after 1 week of  xxxd3554xxx  treatment. nocturnal urinary lte4 levels were reduced by
76% compared with placebo (57).
the clinical effectiveness of  xxxg147xxx  inhibition with
 xxxd3554xxx  therapy was assessed in patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma, receiving either
 xxxd3554xxx  1.6 or 2.4 g/day over 4 weeks. urinary lte4
levels were reduced by 26% and 39%, respectively
(p < 0.01), while no change was noted in the group
receiving placebo (57). in a phase i interaction study
conducted in healthy volunteers looking at pharmacokinetic
and
pharmacodynamic
interactions
between  xxxd3554xxx  and naproxen,  xxxd3554xxx  blocked
ltb4 without any effect on thromboxane levels,
which had a small trend towards decreasing from
baseline after  xxxd3554xxx  treatment, while naproxen
completely blocked the cyclooxygenase pathway
(58). in an antigen challenge study, nasal ltb4 was
inhibited by > 90% by a single oral dose of  xxxd3554xxx 
(800 mg 3 h prior to the challenge) but neither histamine release nor cyclooxygenase product formation was inhibited (53).
overall, these studies indicate that  xxxd3554xxx  is a
specific inhibitor of  xxxg147xxx , resulting in the suppression of leukotriene production and not the shunting
of aa to the cyclooxygenase pathway in humans
where this has been studied (48,52,53,58). however,
the interactions observed between the cyclooxygenase
and  xxxg147xxx  pathways of aa metabolism are complex.
multiple inflammatory cells produce aa metabolites
from both the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways and in vitro studies using human lung parenchyma and bronchial tissue and in vivo studies using
segmental allergen challenge and bal have demonstrated that a variety of aa products are synthesised
and released during ige-mediated reactions. some of
these metabolites arise by direct activation of mast
cells and others may arise from direct activation of
other cells, such as macrophages; theoretically,  xxxg147xxx 
inhibition should not have an effect on the production of cyclooxygenase products if metabolites arise
only via these mechanisms. however, some cyclooxygenase products can arise as a result of the effect
of  xxxg147xxx  products on other cells and/or tissues or as
a result of the physiologic effects of leukotrienes on
airway smooth muscle and mucus glands. in these
instances, one could hypothesise that  xxxg147xxx  inhibition
may result in a decrease in the production of cyclooxygenase products (55). additionally, in cellular, tissue and in vivo models, cyclooxygenase inhibition
has been shown to result in an increase or shunting
of  xxxg147xxx  products while other models have shown no
effect and in vitro and in vivo data are conflicting
(55).

 xxxd3554xxx :  xxxg147xxx  pathway inhibition

clinical studies of  xxxd3554xxx 
asthma
the clinical development programme for  xxxd3554xxx 
included 54 phase ii and iii studies pursuing five
indications. the nda filed for the use of  xxxd3554xxx 
for the treatment of chronic asthma included safety
and efficacy studies in over 6500 patients of which
3000 were asthmatics. the efficacy evaluation was
based on two randomised, placebo-controlled phase
iii pivotal trials. the 3-month study randomised 401
patients while the 6-month study assessed 373
patients (figure 4) (57,59).
in multi-centre, placebo-controlled clinical trials,
 xxxd3554xxx  consistently improved both pulmonary function and asthma symptoms as well as reducing the
need for b2-agonists and systemic steroid rescue for
acute asthma exacerbations (57,59). the improvement in lung function included both acute bronchodilation (within 1 h) and continued improvement
over time (months) (59).
 xxxd3554xxx  was also as effective as theophylline in
the management of chronic asthma. in a 3-month,
multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, parallel trial,
 xxxd3554xxx  (600 and 400 mg q.i.d.) was compared with
theophylline. both therapies demonstrated significant
improvements in fev1 within 30 min and sustained
protection of pulmonary function over 6 h. both
therapies also improved symptoms and corticosteroid
rescue (60). in a randomised, double-blind, multicentre trial comparing low-dose beclomethasone
(400 lg day beclomethasone + 400 or 600 mg  xxxd3554xxx  q.i.d.) plus  xxxd3554xxx  vs. doubling the dose of beclomethasone (800 lg daily), comparable efficacy
was achieved between the two treatment groups with
regard to pulmonary function, oral corticosteroid
rescue and symptoms during 3 months of therapy
(61).
a 12-month, open-label, parallel group surveillance study was conducted to assess the effects of  xxxd3554xxx  on clinical efficacy and evaluate liver function
elevations when added to usual care in asthma
patients. the patients in this trial had baseline fev1
values of ‡ 35%, aged 16 years and up; 2947 (2458
on  xxxd3554xxx  and 489 on usual asthma care alone)
patients from 233 centres in the usa entered this
trial. usual care included ics (57% of patients in the
 xxxd3554xxx  group, 61% of patients in the usual care
alone group), nedocromil (11%  xxxd3554xxx  group, 12%
usual care alone), inhaled b2-agonists (96%  xxxd3554xxx 
group, 96% usual care alone) and salmeterol if the
dose had been stable for at least 4 weeks before study
entry. endpoints included asthma exacerbations,
need for additional asthma therapy, steroid rescue,
emergency care, hospitalizations, fev1 and asthma

symptom scores (62). the addition of  xxxd3554xxx  to
usual care resulted in an improvement of asthma
quality of life and significantly reduced the need for
steroid rescue and emergency care visits (figures 5
and 6).
to assess the efficacy of  xxxd3554xxx  in more severe
asthmatics, patients from the two pivotal phase iii
trials were stratified by their baseline fev1 values per
the current nhlbi asthma guidelines into mild
(n ¼ 13  xxxd3554xxx ; placebo ¼ 12), moderate (n ¼ 126
 xxxd3554xxx ; 129 placebo) and severe persistent (n ¼ 110
 xxxd3554xxx ;110 placebo) asthma groups (64). using a
post hoc analysis, the mean percent changes in each
outcome from baseline to the pre-dosing value on
each visit were calculated. patients whose baseline
fev1 values were £ 50% had statistically significant
improvements in both daily and nocturnal symptoms
and morning trough fev1 as well as statistically significant reductions in the number of daily b2-agonist
puffs and the need for oral corticosteroid rescue
(figure 7). in the group of patients whose baseline

fev1 values were < 50%, there were statistically significant improvements in morning trough fev1,
reductions in the need for oral corticosteroid rescue
and a decreased need for rescue b2-agonists. this

more severe, difficult-to-treat asthmatic population
(64).
potential mechanisms whereby this population of
asthmatics with baseline fev1 values £ 50% have
better outcomes with  xxxg147xxx  inhibition added to their
usual care include a possible neutrophilic inflammatory phenotype with increased ltb4 and increases in
both neutrophil numbers and activation states, a
diminished responsiveness to corticosteroids, therapy
and delayed neutrophil apopotosis. it is possible that
this population of asthmatics may have had comorbidities including aspirin sensitivity with upper
airways inflammation including sinusitis and nasal
polyposis. indeed, multiple reports have suggested
that asthmatic inflammation is extremely heterogeneous; smoking asthmatics have increased neutrophilic
inflammation and a diminished responsiveness to
corticosteroids (49,65–67), which may predispose

 xxxd3554xxx :  xxxg147xxx  pathway inhibition

asthma provocation studies
in a series of provocation challenges,  xxxd3554xxx  significantly reduced airway responses to cold air, exercise,
allergen, histamine and aspirin. the efficacy of
 xxxd3554xxx  in reducing bronchospasm and airway
hyper-responsiveness caused by various stimuli was
apparent after 1–7 days of treatment, suggesting that
 xxxg147xxx  products play an important role in airways
hyper-responsiveness (47,55,68–71). in a randomised,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, the
effect of a single dose of 800 mg  xxxd3554xxx  on bronchoconstriction induced by cold, dry air was examined in 13 asthmatics, aged 18–55 years. all patients
had a known cold air-induced 20% drop in fev1.
after a single dose of  xxxd3554xxx , the amount of cold,
dry air needed to reduce the fev1 by 10% was
increased by 47% (p < 0.002 vs. placebo) along with
significant increases of 39% and 26% for pd15 and
pd20 respectively (p < 0.005 and 0.02) (40).
in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover
exercise challenge model,  xxxd3554xxx  administered
600 mg q.i.d. for 2 days prior to exercise in 24
patients with eia aged 21–45 years allowed for bronchoconstriction that was less severe and shorter in
duration compared with placebo. the  xxxd3554xxx -treated group had reductions in exercise-induced bronchospasm (p < 0.01 vs. placebo) and the difference
remained significant for 45 min following exercise
challenge (72).

aspirin-intolerant asthma
 xxxd3554xxx  therapy has been shown to be effective in
various clinical phenotypes of asthma. multiple studies have demonstrated that  xxxg147xxx  inhibition blunts
the effects of aspirin in an aspirin challenge model
(41,54).
a study by dahlen (71) demonstrated that  xxxg147xxx 
inhibition with  xxxd3554xxx  added to high doses of
inhaled and/or oral steroids in well-controlled aspirin-intolerant asthmatics (fev1 approximately 80%)
resulted in significant clinical improvements in both
the upper and lower airways (figure 8). a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial
was performed to study the effects of  xxxg147xxx  inhibition
in a population of patients with known aspirin sensitivity. aspirin sensitivity was confirmed by an
increase in urinary lte4 levels following aspirin challenge. patients were pretreated with  xxxd3554xxx  600 mg
q.i.d. or placebo for 6–8 days followed by an aspirin
challenge and they were then given the final placebo
or  xxxd3554xxx  dose.  xxxd3554xxx  treatment prevented the
development of upper and lower airways symptoms
as well as improvements in the gastrointestinal and

dermal symptoms associated with the ingestion of
aspirin in this population (54). in another trial, six
aspirin intolerant asthmatics were given aspirin challenge doses below the usual provoking dose of 60 mg
and then had their doses increased until a respiratory
reaction occurred. pretreatment with  xxxd3554xxx  600 mg
q.i.d. was initiated 7 days prior to, and continued
during oral aspirin challenges. patients underwent
single-blind oral aspirin challenges with escalating
doses of aspirin, every 3 h, according to a standard
protocol. while  xxxd3554xxx  pretreatment did not inhibit
the respiratory reactions, all but one of the  xxxd3554xxx 
pretreated subjects required a larger dose of aspirin,
beyond the baseline provoking doses, to induce a respiratory reaction (73). placebo-controlled, well-powered trials are needed to confirm these findings.

nocturnal asthma
in another study by wenzel,  xxxd3554xxx  therapy was
studied in a group of nocturnal asthmatics and controls over 7 days. pulmonary function,  xxxd2586xxx 
challenge, bronchoscopy leukotriene and thromboxane levels in bal and urinary lte4 were collected at
4:00 pm and 4:00 am. bal fluid ltb4 levels were
significantly increased at 4:00 am in the asthmatic
group with ltb4 levels correlating significantly with
a fall in nocturnal fev1 (p < 0.0001). nocturnal
asthmatic urinary lte4 levels were also significantly
increased vs. controls. with  xxxd3554xxx  therapy after
1 week, there were significant decreases in 4:00 am
bal levels of ltb4 (p ¼ 0.01) and urinary levels of
lte4 (p ¼ 0.01) as well as a trend for improving
nocturnal fev1 (p ¼ 0.086) (56).

exercise-induced asthma
two studies have been performed looking at the
effect of  xxxd3554xxx  on bronchospasm because of exercise. the first, looking at the impact of multiple
doses of  xxxd3554xxx  2 days prior to an exercise challenge demonstrated a maximum percent decrement
in baseline fev1 after  xxxd3554xxx  treatment of 15.6%
vs. 28.1% for the placebo-treated group (p < 0.01)
(72). the second study compared single doses of two
leukotriene receptor antagonists (ltras), montelukast and  xxxd3545xxx , a long-acting bronchodilator,
salmeterol and  xxxd3554xxx  in the attenuation of the
effects of exercise-induced bronchospasm. all three
had a comparable magnitude of prophylaxis against
exercise-induced reductions in fev1 (74).

upper airways inflammation
allergic rhinitis
the  xxxg147xxx  inhibition with  xxxd3554xxx  has been studied
in the setting of upper airways inflammation. the

effect of  xxxd3554xxx  on inhibiting leukotriene production in vivo was examined in nasal lavage fluid following antigen challenge in nine patients with
allergic rhinitis. a single 800-mg dose of  xxxd3554xxx 
suppressed ltb4 production in nasal lavage fluid by
90% immediately following allergen challenge
(p < 0.01). 5-hete synthesis was also reduced by
74% (p < 0.02), while  xxxg1073xxx  and histamine release
were not significantly affected (53). in contrast,  xxxd3554xxx  did not affect the release of products of the
cyclooxygenase txb2 or 12-lo pathway. these
results provide direct evidence for the potential role
of  xxxg147xxx  in the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis and
the attenuation of clinical symptoms (53).
a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled
crossover trial of 6 weeks of treatment with  xxxd3554xxx 
600 mg q.i.d. in aspirin-intolerant asthmatics demonstrated improvements in the both lower and upper
airways function and symptoms. bronchodilatory
effects on fev1 were seen within an hour of dosing
of  xxxd3554xxx  and there were significant improvements
in am and pm peak nasal inspiratory flow (pnif)
and symptoms of anosmia (p < 0.01) and rhinorrea
(71).
in a crossover study of patients with known aspirin sensitivity,  xxxd3554xxx  treatment prevented the
development of the nasal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal
and dermal symptoms associated with the ingestion
of aspirin (54).

chronic nasal polyposis
a recent case series suggested that anosmic patients
with chronic nasal polypsosis treated with  xxxd3554xxx 
therapy provides a sustained restoration of smell
along with improved quality of life (75). the treatment effects of  xxxd3554xxx  and  xxxd3545xxx , a  xxxg599xxx 
receptor antagonist, were assessed in a prospective
study of 36 patients with sinonasal polyposis, 77% of
whom were on oral steroids. the authors noted that
 xxxd3554xxx  had a better effect and was able to rescue
‘ xxxd3545xxx  failures’ with significant improvement in
sinus headaches, facial pain and pressure, dental
pain, purulent anterior nasal discharge, postnasal
drip, nasal congestion and obstruction and olfaction
(76).

sinusitis
in a year-long, open-label surveillance trial comparing  xxxd3554xxx  plus usual care vs. usual care alone in
2947 (2458 on  xxxd3554xxx  and 489 on usual care),
sinusitis was more commonly reported in the usual
care group vs. the  xxxd3554xxx  plus usual care group
(p ¼ 0.001) (62). a recent report suggested that ziletuon (600 mg q.i.d.) treatment in an asthmatic with
concurrent sinusitis, polyposis and aspirin sensitivity

 xxxd3554xxx :  xxxg147xxx  pathway inhibition

provided relief from nasal symptoms (sinus pain,
headache and nasal blockage). when treatment was
stopped, the patients’ symptoms returned, suggesting
that the disease process was mediated by  xxxg147xxx  products and the authors suggested that the inhibition of
the  xxxg147xxx  pathway with  xxxd3554xxx  resulted in a regression of the patients’ sinusitis and symptoms (77).
these reports suggest that there may be a role for
 xxxg147xxx  inhibition in the treatment and management of
sinusitis; double-blind, well-controlled trials are warranted to confirm these initial findings.

dermatological conditions: atopic dermatitis
and urticaria
in a pilot study to examine the role of  xxxd3554xxx  in
atopic dermatitis, six adult patients received 6 weeks
of  xxxd3554xxx  therapy, 600 mg q.i.d. disease dissatisfaction scores decreased from a mean of 8 (out of a
possible 10) to 4.4. pruritis scores showed a trend
toward improvement during the study and objective
skin erythema scores decreased from a baseline mean
of 24 (out of a possible 60) to 14 following  xxxd3554xxx 
treatment (78).
the clinical efficacy of  xxxd3554xxx  in urticaria has
been studied. ellis reported on the need for additional therapy in urticaria patients not responding to
antihistamines alone. in this series, one patient was
placed on  xxxd3554xxx  and showed improvement within
3 h and another patient had improved respiratory
status and resolution of urticaria within 24 h of
starting  xxxd3554xxx  600 mg q.i.d. (79). spector (80)
reported a case in which a patient with intractable
chronic urticaria demonstrated resolution after
4 days of treatment with 600 mg of  xxxd3554xxx  q.i.d.
these case reports and pilot study suggest a potential role for  xxxg147xxx  inhibition in dermatological conditions; larger and more adequately powered, blinded,
placebo-controlled trials are warranted to confirm
these initial findings.

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd)
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterised by fixed airways obstruction and often associated with neutrophilic inflammation. to examine
the effect of  xxxg147xxx  inhibition in subjects with
severe copd,  xxxd3554xxx  600 mg was administered
orally four times a day for 3 months in eight subjects (mean age 66 ± 6 years), with mean fev1 values of 0.91 ± 0.33 l (29 ± 6% predicted) (81). the
primary outcome was exercise capacity measured
by the 6-min walk test; secondary outcomes included fev1, health-related quality of life (hrql),
the st george’s respiratory questionnaire (sgrq)
and dyspnoea rating. the mean 6-min walk distance increased 244 ft or 24% of baseline

(1011 ± 361 to 1255 ± 339 ft, p ¼ 0.007). changes
in the 6-min walk distance correlated strongly with
changes in sgrq total scores (r ¼ )0.73,
p < 0.05) and there were significant improvements
in the hrql, suggesting that in patients with
severe copd,  xxxd3554xxx  improves exercise capacity
and quality of life (81).
these data suggest a potential role for the modulation of the  xxxg147xxx  pathway; perhaps due to increased
neutrophilic component in this population. placebocontrolled, blinded, randomised trials are warranted
to confirm these initial findings.

approved clinical indications and
dosing of  xxxd3554xxx 
 xxxd3554xxx  is currently approved by the fda for the
prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in
adults and children 12 years of age and older (82).
the currently fda-approved dosing schedule for
 xxxd3554xxx  is one 600 mg tablet four times a day. for
convenience, it may be taken with meals and at bedtime and it is recommended that  xxxd3554xxx  be taken
regularly, even during symptom-free periods (82).

dosing frequency
debuske (83,84) studied the impact of reducing the
dosing and the frequency of the dosing regimen in
patients controlled with  xxxd3554xxx  q.i.d. dosing.
patients were treated with  xxxd3554xxx  q.i.d. for 8 weeks
in an open-label phase followed by an 8-week double-blind phase, during which patients received a
reduced dose/frequency of  xxxd3554xxx , either 600 (n ¼
72) or 800 mg (n ¼ 67) t.i.d. during an additional
8-week double-blind phase, the  xxxd3554xxx  dose/frequency was further reduced to either 600 (n ¼ 53)
or 800 mg (n ¼ 60) b.i.d. patients had to demonstrate an improvement of at least 10% from baseline
fev1 values to qualify for entry into the t.i.d. phase
of this trial, and the entry criteria also stipulated
that only b2-agonists were used to treat their
asthma. the reduction in dosage did not lead to an
increase in acute asthma exacerbations or systemic
corticosteroid rescue treatments during the t.i.d. and
b.i.d. periods.
the authors suggested that some patients who
demonstrate improved pulmonary function following
treatment with  xxxd3554xxx  600 mg q.i.d. may be able to
maintain a comparable level of improved lung function, symptom control, reduced b2-agonist use and
fewer systemic corticosteroid rescue treatments on a
lower dose or frequency of  xxxd3554xxx  administration
(83,84). importantly, there are no data to support
starting patients on  xxxd3554xxx  with any dosing regimen
other than q.i.d.

 xxxd3554xxx :  xxxg147xxx  pathway inhibition

other formulations of  xxxd3554xxx  have been developed, including a controlled release b.i.d. tablet formulation and an intravenous formulation (85,86).
the results of a phase i/ii clinical trial designed to
evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
the intravenous formulation of  xxxd3554xxx  with asthma
were recently released (85). in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 60 patients were randomised
into four escalating dose groups (75, 150, 300 and
600 mg), each receiving one infusion of either  xxxd3554xxx  intravenous or placebo. the data suggested that
 xxxd3554xxx  intravenous was well tolerated at all doses
tested with no serious adverse events reported in the
trial (85). further details and information will await
peer-reviewed presentations and publication.
a controlled release formulation of  xxxd3554xxx 
(1200 mg b.i.d.) has been developed and an new
drug application (nda) was recently submitted to
the fda for approval. recently data was released
from a 16-week randomised, double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled study. a total of 613
patients were randomised into the double-blind
dosing period to compare the safety and efficacy of
 xxxd3554xxx  cr 1200 mg (n ¼ 206) with placebo (n ¼
203). an arm of the currently approved formulation
of  xxxd3554xxx  (600 mg q.i.d.) (n ¼ 101) and a  xxxd3554xxx 
(600 mg q.i.d.) placebo arm (n ¼ 101) were included
as a benchmark comparison with previous  xxxd3554xxx 
(600 mg q.i.d.) efficacy studies. patients enrolled in
the  xxxd3554xxx  cr arms had mean fev1 values of
58.5%. there was a similar incidence of adverse
events in the  xxxd3554xxx  cr and placebo groups and
the most commonly reported adverse events (‡ 5)
were exacerbation of asthma, headache, sinusitis,
nausea, nasopharyngitis and pharyngolaryngeal pain.
the incidence of elevations in  xxxg941xxx  was similar to data reported previously in clinical studies of  xxxd3554xxx  (600 mg q.i.d.) (86).
both of these new formulations are currently in
clinical trials.

tolerability
a total of 5542 patients have been exposed to  xxxd3554xxx 
in clinical trials, over 2200 of them for > 6 months
and 742 for > 1 year. generally,  xxxd3554xxx  was well tolerated with the frequency of discontinuation from the
asthma clinical studies due to any adverse event comparable between  xxxd3554xxx  (9.7%) and placebo-treated
(8.4%) groups (85). the only adverse event that with
a statistically significant difference between  xxxd3554xxx 
and placebo was dyspepsia (8.2% vs. 2.9%) (82).
in the long-term safety surveillance trial of  xxxd3554xxx  plus usual asthma care vs. usual asthma care
alone, a similar adverse event profile was seen as in
other clinical trials (62).

safety
in placebo-controlled clinical trials, the frequency of
liver transaminase (alt) elevations ‡ 3· upper limit
of normal (uln) was 1.9% for  xxxd3554xxx -treated
patients, compared with 0.2% for placebo-treated
patients (82). in controlled and uncontrolled trials,
one patient developed symptomatic hepatitis with
jaundice, which resolved upon discontinuation of
therapy. an additional three patients with transaminase elevations developed mild hyperbilirubinemia
that was < 3· uln. there was no evidence of hypersensitivity or other alternative aetiologies for these
findings.
in the phase iiib open-label, long-term safety surveillance study, looking at 2458 patients treated with
 xxxd3554xxx  in addition to usual care and 489 asthmatics
on usual asthma care only, the incidence of liver
enzyme increases £ 3 or more times uln occurred in
4.6% of patients in the  xxxd3554xxx  group and 1.2% in
the usual asthma care group (p < 0.001) (48). these
alt elevations occurred mostly during the first
3 months and there was resolution (to £ 2· uln) in
all of the patients with elevations (figure 5b). of
note, 52% resolved while continuing the drug, having
alt elevations between three and five times uln,
and the remaining 48% resolved (< 2· uln) upon
discontinuation of the drug (mean time of 4 weeks)
after cessation of  xxxd3554xxx . additionally, the monthly
risk of an elevation of alt of 3· uln in the  xxxd3554xxx -treated group was 2.05% in the first month,
decreasing to 1.29% in the second month and to
0.35% in the third month. after the third month,
there was no significant difference between the risk of
an elevation of alt 3· uln for  xxxd3554xxx  plus usual
care (0.19–0.49%) vs. usual care alone (0.18–0.25%).
the magnitude of elevation was independent of the
duration of  xxxd3554xxx  exposure (48).
overall, more than 5000 patients have been treated
with  xxxd3554xxx  in clinical trials. the profile of liver test
abnormalities observed strongly suggests a mechanism
of liver injury related to a metabolic idiosyncrasy. the
mechanisms of idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity are not
well understood (87).
 xxxd3554xxx  is contraindicated in patients with active
liver disease or transaminase elevations ‡ 3· uln
(82). it is recommended that hepatic transaminases
be evaluated at initiation of and during therapy with
 xxxd3554xxx  (82).
occurrences of low white blood cell count
(£ 2.8 · 109/l) were observed in 1.0% of 1678
patients taking  xxxd3554xxx  and 0.6% of 1056 patients
taking placebo in placebo-controlled studies (85).
these findings were transient and the majority of
cases returned toward normal or baseline with continued  xxxd3554xxx  dosing. all remaining cases returned

with  xxxd3554xxx  plus usual asthma care vs. 489 patients
treated only with usual asthma care for up to 1 year
(48,82).
 xxxd3554xxx  is classified as a pregnancy category c (82).
there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in
pregnant women. thus, it is recommended that  xxxd3554xxx  should be used during pregnancy only if the
potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

in addition,  xxxd3554xxx  has shown promise in a number of other conditions, including upper airway
inflammatory conditions such as nasal polyposis
and sinusitis, dermatological disease and copd. the
development of new formulations, including a controlled release tablet formulation for b.i.d. dosing
and an intravenous preparation for acute asthma
exacerbations may enhance clinical utility and
expand therapeutic indications.

 xxxd3554xxx  has a rapid oral absorption and a plasma
protein binding 93%. the half-life elimination has a
mean duration of 2.5 h. there is no effect of age
(elderly people, young adults), gender, race and renal
insufficiency.  xxxd3554xxx  is metabolised by direct glucuronide conjugation (80–90% of the dose). in vitro
studies utilising human liver microsomes have shown
that  xxxd3554xxx  and its n-dehydroxylated metabolite
can also be oxidatively metabolised by the cytochrome p45 isoenzymes cyp1a2,  xxxg590xxx  and
cyp2c9. it is recommended that when taking  xxxd3554xxx , theophylline doses should be reduced by 50%
and levels appropriately monitored (48,82). patients
taking propanolol or warfarin should be monitored
and the dose adjusted if necessary. drug–drug interaction studies between  xxxd3554xxx  and prednisone and
 xxxd2054xxx  (oral contraceptive) have shown no
significant interaction. there is also no significant
interaction between  xxxd3554xxx  and digoxin, phenytoin,
 xxxd3255xxx  or naproxen. in a large surveillance
study, patients were allowed to continue other
asthma medications (ics, nedocromil, reduced doses
of theophylline) as well as other types of drugs including antihypertensives, oral contraceptives and lipidlowering agents on a case-by-case basis and the safety
profile of this study did not differ from the placebocontrolled trials (50,82).

conclusion
in conclusion, the  xxxg147xxx  pathway results in the formation of leukotrienes, including ltb4, 5-oxo-ete
and the cysteinyl leukotrienes (ltc4, ltd4 and
lte4).  xxxd3554xxx  is the only commercially and clinically available inhibitor of the  xxxg147xxx  pathway. in a
number of clinical trials,  xxxd3554xxx  has been shown to
improve airway function and inflammation, asthma
symptom control and quality of life in asthmatics.
given the important role that leukotrienes play in
airway inflammation,  xxxd3554xxx  provides an additional
therapeutic option in the chronic management of
asthma, particularly severe, difficult-to-treat asthma.
