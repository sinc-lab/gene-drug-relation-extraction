abstract

(r)-hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  has a higher affinity for m, receptors in
nb-ok 1 cells, pancreas m, and striatum m, receptors (pki 7.9 to 8.3) than for
by contrast, is nonselective
cardiac m2 receptors (pki 7 .o).(s)-hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx ,
(pki 5.8 to 6.1). our goal in the present study was to evaluate the importance of the
hydrophobic phenyl, and cyclohexyl rings of hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  for the stereoselectivity and receptor selectivity of hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  binding to the four muscarinic receptors. our results indicated that replacement of the phenyl ring of
hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  by a cyclohexyl group (+ dicyclidol) and of the cyclohexyl ring
by a phenyl moiety (+  xxxd1907xxx ) induced a large (4-to 80-fold) decrease in binding
afflnity for all muscarinic receptors.  xxxd1907xxx  had a significant preference for m,,
m,, and m, over m, receptors; dicyclidol, by contrast, had a greater affinity for m,
and m, than for m, and m3 receptors. the binding free energy decrease due to
replacement of the phenyl and the cyclohexyl groups of (r)-hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  by,
respectively, a cyclohexyl and a phenyl moiety was almost additive in the case of
m, (striatum)binding sites. in the case of the cardiac m,, pancreatic m,, or nb-ok
1m, receptors the respective binding free energies were not completely additive.
these results suggest that the four (r)-hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  “binding moieties”
(phenyl, cyclohexyl, hydroxy, and protonated amino group) cannot simultaneously
form optimal interactions with the m1, m,, and m, muscarinic receptors. when
each of the hydrophobic groups is modified, the position of the whole molecule,
relative to the four subsites, was changed to allow a n optimal overall interaction
with the muscarinic receptor.

demonstrated that muscarinic receptors are capable of
discriminating the two enantiomers of hexahydrodifenidol, and have a greater affinity for the (r)enanti~mer.’~~~~
in a previous study on the stereoselective binding of
 xxxd3019xxx  enantiomers, we suggested that muscarinic receptor subtypes possess four binding subsites for
antag0ni~ts.l~
one of these “subsites” is the ionic binding site recognizing the protonated amino group of  xxxd3019xxx ; the second, a polar site forming a hydrogen
bond with the  xxxd3019xxx  hydroxy group, and the two
hydrophobic binding sites recognizing, respectively,
the phenyl or the cyclohexyl groups of (r)- xxxd3019xxx 
with a greater affinity. our results further indicated
that when (s)-procyclidineis brought into contact with
the receptor, the ionic and hydroxy groups are in the
correct position, and the phenyl and the cyclohexyl
groups in contact, respectively, with the cyclohexylpreferring and phenyl-preferring subsites.15
given the great structure homology of  xxxd3019xxx 
and hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx , we expected that the  xxxd3019xxx  binding model should also be applicable to
hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  (fig. 2). to test this hypothesis,
we decided to measure the affinity of two achiral compounds structurally related to hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx :
 xxxd1907xxx  (containing an additional phenyl moiety instead of the cyclohexyl group) (fig. 1) and dicyclidol
(containing an additional cyclohexyl moiety instead of
the phenyl group). we hoped to measure the difference
of binding energy of a phenyl versus cyclohexyl group
with each hydrophobic subsite.

homogenate preparations

human nb-ok 1neuroblastoma cells were cultured
in rpmi 1640 medium enriched with 10% foetal calf
serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 pg/ml
strept~mycin.~
for l3h]nms binding experiments, the
cells were rinsed, detached, and centrifuged in 20 mm

to prepare rat tissue homogenates, male wistar albino rats (200-250 g) were killed by decapitation and
the heart, pancreas, and striatum immediately removed. homogenate preparations were performed at
4°c. the heart was rinsed in isotonic  xxxg2020xxx , then homogenized in 2.5 ml of 20 mmtris-hc1buffer (ph 7.51,
enriched with 250 mm sucrose, with an ultraturrax
homogenizer (maximal speed for 5 sec) followed by addition of 12.5 ml of the same buffer, 7 up and down
strokes with a glass-teflon homogenizer, and filtration
on 2 layers of medical gauze. the resulting homogenate
was used immediately or stored in liquid nitrogen until
use. the striatum was homogenized in 2 ml of 20 mm
tris-hc1 buffer (ph 7.5) enriched with 250 mm sucrose, using a glass-teflonhomogenizer (7 up and down
strokes). the resulting homogenate was stored in liquid nitrogen until use, and diluted 20-fold with the
same buffer immediately before the experiment. the
pancreas was minced with scissors, homogenized with
a glass-teflon homogenizer in 8 ml of 300 m m sucrose
enriched with trasylol (500 kiu/ml) and bacitracin
(0.2 mg/ml). the resulting homogenate was immediately filtered on two layers of medical gauze and diluted ll-fold with an incubation buffer made of 66 mm

receptor-binding studies

binding to striatum m, (“b”) receptors
the
tracer concentration used in these experiments (0.25
nm) was equivalent to 5-fold the tracer’s k d value at
striatum m, receptors.’ for incubation with rat pancreas homogenate, we added 980 ~1 of homogenate to
220 pl drug and tracer (in water). a 4-h incubation
period was necessary to allow equilibrium binding. l1
the l3h1nms concentration used was 0.24 nm, i.e., 2fold the tracer’s k d value a t pancreas m3 binding
sites.” all incubations were terminated by addition of
2 ml of ice-cold filtration buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, ph 7.4). bound and free tracer were immediately separated by filtration on gf/c glass-fiber
filters (whatman, maidstone, england) presoaked
overnight in 0.05% polyethyleneimine. the samples
were rinsed three times with filtration buffer. the filters were then dried, and the bound radioactivity
counted by liquid scintillation. nonspecific 13h]nms
binding was defined as tracer bound in the presence of
1 pm atropine.
protein concentration was determined according to
lowry et a1.l’ using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard.
analysis of binding data

all competition curves were repeated in duplicate, at
least three times on different preparations.
values
were determined by a computer-aided procedure,2° assuming the existence of only one receptor subtype. indeed, experimental data points were within 3% of expected values, assuming that the molecules investigated competed with i3h1nms for binding to a single
site.
ki values were calculated from ic50values, using the
cheng and prusoff equationz1 which assumes competitive inhibition of tracer binding to a single receptor
subtype. the i3h1nms k d value for the four systems
investigated was determined in separate experim e n t ~ . ~ , the
’ , ~ ~pki values, summarized in table 1,
corresponds to -log ki values.
the standard deviation of - log ic50 determination
was equal to or below 0.1 log unit. repeated determinations of i3h1nmsk d values were within 10%of each
other. this error should be added to errors in
determinations, since [3hlnms kd values were used to
calculate pki values. we therefore estimated the standard deviation of pki values as being of approximately
0.15 log unit (40% of ki value).
the binding free energy (ag) for the formation of a
ligand-receptor complex is related to its affinity constant k , by eq. (1):

binding studies were performed at 25°c in a 50 mm
sodium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) enriched with 2 mm
mgclzand containing 13hlnmsand the indicated unlabelled drug concentrations in a total volume of 1.2
ml. for pancreas binding studies, the incubation buffer
also contained bovine  xxxg124xxx  (1%w/v), bacitracin (0.2 mg/ml), and trasylol (500 kiu/ml) to prevent receptor degradation.
to measure l3h1nms binding to human nb-ok 1
cell homogenates, we used 80 p1 of homogenate, corresponding to about 200 pg protein per assay. the incubation period was 2 h in the presence of 0.25 nm
i3hlnms in order to allow binding equilibrium. this
i3h1nms concentration was equivalent to 2-fold the
tracer’s k d value at  xxxg447xxx ^.^ for incubation with
rat heart homogenates, we used 80 p1 of the homogenate, corresponding to 400-500 pg protein per assay.
the 2-h incubation period was sufficient to allow equilibrium binding. the i3h1nms concentration used was
1.0 nm, i.e., 2-fold the tracer’s k d value at m, binding

the affinity of the hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  eutomer, (r)hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx ,for m,, m,, and m4 receptors was

parable, our results cannot be explained by contamination of (s)-hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  by the (r)-enantiomer.
discussion

we have previously shown that the stereoselective
binding of the enantiomers of  xxxd3019xxx  to muscarinic binding sites is best explained by the existence of
four subsites (fig. 2): one for the protonated amino
group, one for t h e hydroxy group, one phenylpreferring hydrophobic subsite, and one cyclohexylpreferring hydrophobic subsite.15 the relative spatial
positions of these four subsites is such t h a t (r) xxxd3019xxx  h a s a g r e a t e r affin ity t h a n (s) xxxd3019xxx  due to a better interaction of the hydrophobic groups with their corresponding subsites. the
free energy of (r)- xxxd3019xxx  binding can therefore be
described by eq. (3):

where agl, ag,, ag,, and ag, represent the free energy achievable by a n optimal interaction of the phenyl
ring of the ligand with receptor site 1, the cyclohexyl
group with receptor site 2, the hydroxy group with receptor site 3, and the protonated amino group with receptor site 4. ag values should be as negative as possible to obtain high affinity binding, and factors a,p, y,
and 6 in eq. (3) take into account the fact that all four
groups are not of necessity simultaneously in the optimal positions to interact with receptor sites 1 to 4 (a,p,
y, and 6 values probably vary between 0 and 1, provided that the corresponding group does not obstruct
binding by steric hindrance).
we compared in this work the binding properties of
hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  enantiomers and of two achiral
analogues,  xxxd1907xxx  and dicyclidol (fig. 1) to four muscarinic receptor subtypes. our results confirm that the
presence of a phenyl and a cyclohexyl ring in the correct spatial position [(r)-configuration] is important for
the binding of hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  to muscarinic receptors. indeed, the affinity decrease due to replacement of
the cyclohexyl ring by a phenyl group varied between
0.6 and 1.2 log units (corresponding to a n increase of
the binding free energy of 0.8 to 1.6 kcal/mol) (table 2).
the affinity decrease due to replacement of the phenyl
by a cyclohexyl ring was even more impressive. it
amounted to 0.9 to 1.5 log units (free energy difference:
1.2 to 2.6 kcal/mol) (table 2).
the binding free energy decrease due to replacement
of t h e phenyl a n d t h e cyclohexyl groups of (r)hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  by, respectively, a cyclohexyl and
a phenyl moiety was additive in case of m, receptors
(table 2).
in contrast with our previous results, using the  xxxd3019xxx  enantiomers (tables 1 and 2),15this substitution effect was not fully additive at m,, m,, and m,
receptors: the difference of the free energy of binding of
(s)-and (r)-hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  to mi, m,, and m, subtypes was lower than expected by up to 1 kcal/mol.
these discrepancies were subtype dependent and not
correlated with receptor stereoselectivity, indicating

"bindingfree energies were calculated according to eq. (2), see under
methods.

that they did not reflect a n imperfect separation of the
(r)- and (s)-enantiomers. they were small, when compared with the free energy of binding of the drugs: at
most 12% of th e binding free energy of t h e ($3)enantiomer to the receptors.
we would like to suggest th a t by contrast with (r) xxxd3019xxx , the four subgroups of hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx 
cannot be simultaneously in the optimal position to
interact with the corresponding four subsites of muscarinic m,, m,, and m, receptors. this corresponds in
eq. (3) to values of the parameters a,p, y, and 6 <1.0.
the results indicate that, when the structure of (r)hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  is modified, e.g., by replacement of
the phenyl ring in subsite 1 by a cyclohexyl group (+
dicyclidol), the position of dicyclidol in the receptor is
adjusted to increase the importance of the (good) interaction with subsites 2, 3, and 4 at the expense of the
(weakened) interaction with subsite 1. therefore, the
difference of t h e free energy of binding of (r)hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  and, for instance,  xxxd1907xxx  or dicyclidol does not reflect exactly the modification of ag,
or agp values. the development of a n interaction
model using molecular modeling methods and based on
published mi, m,, m,, a n d  xxxg450xxx  protein
sequencesz3 might provide a n improved rationale for
t h e stereoselective interactions of (r)- a n d (s)hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  (this study), and of (r)- and (s)pr~cyclidine'~
with muscarinic receptor subtypes.

the muscarinic receptor stereoselectivity for the
