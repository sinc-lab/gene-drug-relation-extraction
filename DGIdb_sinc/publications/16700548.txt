abstract: nad(p)h  xxxg521xxx  1 ( xxxg1592xxx ) is a ubiquitous flavoenzyme that catalyzes twoelectron reduction of quinones to hydroquinones utilizing nad(p)h as an electron donor.  xxxg1592xxx  binds
and stabilizes several short-lived proteins including the tumor suppressors p53 and p73 and the enzyme
 xxxg1626xxx  (odc).  xxxd1875xxx  is a widely used potent competitive inhibitor of  xxxg1592xxx 
enzymatic activity, which competes with nad(p)h for binding to  xxxg1592xxx .  xxxd1875xxx  also disrupts the
binding of  xxxg1592xxx  to p53, p73, and odc and induces their ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation.
we report here the crystal structure of human  xxxg1592xxx  in complex with  xxxd1875xxx  at 2.75 å resolution.
we have identified the interactions of  xxxd1875xxx  with the different residues of  xxxg1592xxx  and the
conformational changes imposed upon  xxxd1875xxx  binding. the most prominent conformational changes
that occur in the presence of  xxxd1875xxx  involve tyr 128 and phe 232 that are present on the surface of
the  xxxg1592xxx  catalytic pocket. on the basis of the comparison of the  xxxg1592xxx  structure in complex with different
 xxxg1592xxx  inhibitors and our previous analysis of  xxxg1592xxx  mutants, we propose that the specific conformation
of tyr 128 and phe 232 is important for  xxxg1592xxx  interaction with p53 and other client proteins.

nad(p)h  xxxg521xxx  1 ( xxxg1592xxx )1 is a ubiquitous flavoenzyme that catalyzes two-electron reduction of
various quinones utilizing nad(p)h as an electron donor
(1).  xxxg1592xxx -mediated reduction of quinones to hydroquinones
is an important cellular defense mechanism against oxidative
stress (2). in addition to its role in the detoxification of
quinones, the enzyme catalyzes the reductive activation of
quinolic chemotherapeutic compounds such as  xxxd2655xxx 
and  xxxd320xxx  (3, 4). studies of  xxxg1592xxx  structure and
function have shown that  xxxg1592xxx  is a homodimer that
functions via a “ping-pong” mechanism. nad(p)h binds to
 xxxg1592xxx , reduces the fad cofactor, and is then released,
allowing the quinone substrate to bind the enzyme and to
be reduced. the nad(p)h and the quinone binding sites of
 xxxg1592xxx  have a significant overlap, thus providing a molecular
basis for this ping-pong mechanism (5).
certain coumarins, flavones, and the reactive dye cibacron
blue are competitive inhibitors of  xxxg1592xxx  activity, which
compete with nad(p)h for binding to  xxxg1592xxx .  xxxd1875xxx 
[3,3′-methylenebis(4-hydroxycoumarin)] is the most potent
competitive inhibitor of  xxxg1592xxx  with a ki of 1-10 nm (6).
 xxxd1875xxx  competes with nad(p)h for binding to  xxxg1592xxx 
and prevents the electron transfer to fad (6). other

coumarins [warfarin and esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin)]
(7), flavones [ xxxd2905xxx , chrysin, and dhf (7,8-dihydroxyflavone)] (8, 9), and  xxxd1689xxx  (9, 10) are less
potent inhibitors of  xxxg1592xxx  than  xxxd1875xxx  and appear to
bind differently to the enzyme. the ki for  xxxg1592xxx  inhibition
by  xxxd1689xxx  is 170 nm. another  xxxg1592xxx  inhibitor, es936
(5-methoxy-1,2-dimethyl-3-[(4-nitrophenoxy)methyl]indole4,7-dione), is a mechanism-based inhibitor with a ki of 450
nm. the inhibition of  xxxg1592xxx  by es936 is nadh-dependent
and involves the generation of reactive iminium species that
alkylate a tyrosine residue of  xxxg1592xxx  (11). recently, we have
found that curcumin, a natural phenolic compound found in
the spice turmeric, also inhibits  xxxg1592xxx  activity (12).
in addition to its role in the detoxification of quinones,
 xxxg1592xxx  is also a 20s proteasome-associated protein that plays
an important role in the stability of the tumor suppressor
p53 and several other short-lived proteins including p73r
and  xxxg1626xxx  (odc) (13-20).  xxxg1592xxx  binds
and stabilizes p53, protecting p53 from ubiquitin-independent
20s proteasomal degradation (16, 18, 21).  xxxd1875xxx  and
several other inhibitors of  xxxg1592xxx  activity, which compete
with nadh for binding to  xxxg1592xxx , disrupt the binding of
 xxxg1592xxx  to p53 and induce ubiquitin-independent p53 degradation (16, 18). however, the molecular basis of  xxxg1592xxx 
association and dissociation from p53 and its other client
proteins is unknown. studying the structure of  xxxg1592xxx  in a
complex with  xxxd1875xxx , a complex that is impaired in
protein binding (p53, p73r, and odc) might provide
important insight into the mechanism of  xxxg1592xxx  interaction
with p53 and its other client proteins.
several studies investigated the binding of  xxxd1875xxx  to
 xxxg1592xxx  using site-directed mutagenesis, inhibitor binding
analysis, and computer modeling, but a definitive structure
of  xxxg1592xxx  bound to  xxxd1875xxx  has not yet been resolved

(9, 22). in this study, we report the crystal structure of human
 xxxg1592xxx  complexed with  xxxd1875xxx  at 2.75 å resolution. by
analyzing the crystal structure, we have identified the
interactions of  xxxd1875xxx  with the different residues of
 xxxg1592xxx  and the consequent conformational changes. in
addition, comparison of the  xxxg1592xxx  structures in complex with
different  xxxg1592xxx  inhibitors led us to propose a model whereby
the conformation of two key  xxxg1592xxx  residues present on the
surface of the  xxxg1592xxx  catalytic pocket, tyr 128 and phe 232,
may determine the binding affinity of  xxxg1592xxx  to p53 and to
other client proteins.
materials and methods
purification of recombinant  xxxg1592xxx . bl21(de3) bacteria
expressing pet28-his-tev- xxxg1592xxx  were lysed by sonication
in 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 150 mm nacl, and 1 mm
pmsf. soluble his-tev- xxxg1592xxx  was purified using a ninta column (hitrap chelating hp) followed by gel filtration
chromatography (hiload 16/60 superdex 200). purified histev- xxxg1592xxx  was then cleaved by tev protease, and the histev was removed upon binding to a ni-nta column.
crystallization and data collection. single crystals of
 xxxg1592xxx  with  xxxd1875xxx  were obtained by the microbatch

phaser (24) by using the refined structure of a native
 xxxg1592xxx  dimer (1dxo in the protein data bank) as a model.
atomic refinement was carried out with the program cns
(25). map display and model rebuilding were performed
using the program o (26) and model inspection using
whatif and procheck (27). the figures were created
using the program pymol. the atomic coordinates of the
 xxxg1592xxx - xxxd1875xxx  crystal structure were deposited in the
protein data bank (pdb accession code 2f1o).
results
structure determination and refinement. the crystal
structure of the hnqo1 in complex with  xxxd1875xxx  was
determined at 2.75 å resolution and was refined to r-values
of 22.5% and rfree values of 26.9% with good stereochemistry
(table 1). final maps show good density for most portions
of the polypeptide chains including the fad and the bound
 xxxd1875xxx  (figure 1).

interlocked monomers of 273 residues related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis of symmetry. each monomer is
composed of two domains: a large catalytic domain with
r/beta fold with flavodoxin topology (residues 1-220) and a
small c-terminal domain (residues 221-273). two catalytic
sites are formed and are present at the dimer interface. two
fad molecules are present; each one is bound to the catalytic
domain of each monomer. the fad moiety in the catalytic
domain of one of the monomers forms one wall of the
catalytic pocket, while residues from both monomers generate the other walls (5, 28).
 xxxd1875xxx  is a competitive inhibitor of  xxxg1592xxx  with
respect to nad(p)h (6). our hnqo1- xxxd1875xxx  structure
shows that  xxxd1875xxx  is bound to each of the catalytic sites
interacting with fad and with residues from both monomers
(figure 2). the plane of  xxxd1875xxx  stacks parallel to the
isoalloxazine ring of the fad that forms one of the walls of
the catalytic pocket. the average distance between the planes
of the two rings is 4 å.  xxxd1875xxx  binds to the active site
through a series of hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds with
residues from both monomers and the fad (figure 3). one
coumarin ring of  xxxd1875xxx  makes two hydrogen bonds:
o5 of  xxxd1875xxx  with the oh of tyr 128 of the first
monomer and the o17 of  xxxd1875xxx  with the n of his
161 of the second monomer (figure 3).
comparison of the structure of the hnqo1- xxxd1875xxx 
complex with apo hnqo1. alignment of the apo hnqo1
dimer (pdb accession code 1d4a) with hnqo1 in complex
with  xxxd1875xxx  yields 0.36 rms deviation for the 546
r-carbon atoms. the structural changes associated with
 xxxd1875xxx  binding occur on several residues involving both
monomers. maximal movement is observed with tyr 128
and phe 232 of the first monomer (figure 4a). the distance
between these two residues increases from about 5 å in the
apo hnqo1 to about 12 å in the hnqo1- xxxd1875xxx 
complex (table 2). other residues exhibit more limited
movement and include phe 236 of the first monomer and
phe 106 and his 161 of the second monomer. the fad
molecule and tyr 126 (not shown) adopt identical conformations in both apo hnqo1 and hnqo1- xxxd1875xxx  structures
(figure 4a). the allosteric changes in residues tyr 128 and

phe 232 of hnqo1 upon binding of  xxxd1875xxx  are clearly
apparent on the surface of  xxxg1592xxx  (figure 5; compare panels
a and c).
comparison of the structure of the hnqo1- xxxd1875xxx 
complex with the hnqo1- xxxd1952xxx  complex.  xxxg1592xxx 
catalyzes two-electron reduction of quinones to hydroquinones. the crystal structure of hnqo1 with  xxxd1952xxx 
( xxxd1952xxx ), an  xxxg1592xxx  substrate,
was previously determined (pdb accession code 1dxo).
 xxxd1952xxx  binds to the active site through a series of
interactions involving the fad and several hydrophobic and
hydrophilic residues (28). the  xxxd1952xxx  stacks parallel
3.5 å from the isoalloxazine ring of the fad, forming
hydrogen bonds with tyr 126, tyr 128, and his 161 (28).
alignment of hnqo1 dimer in complex with  xxxd1952xxx 
with the hnqo1 in complex with  xxxd1875xxx  yields 0.33
rms deviation for the 546 r-carbon atoms. the major
differences observed between the two structures involve the
positions of tyr 128 and phe 232 of the first monomer
(figure 4b). the distance between these two residues
increases significantly from about 4 å in the hnqo1 in
complex with  xxxd1952xxx  to about 12 å in the nqo1dicoumarol complex (table 2). the position of tyr 128 and
phe 232 in the apo hnqo1 and the hnqo1 in complex with
 xxxd1952xxx  is similar (figure 5; compare panels a and b).
comparison of the structure of the hnqo1- xxxd1875xxx 
complex with the hnqo1-es936 complex. the quinone
es936 is a mechanism-based inhibitor of  xxxg1592xxx . es936
undergoes nadh-dependent reduction by  xxxg1592xxx  followed
by the loss of  xxxd2821xxx , generating a reactive iminium
species that alkylates either tyr 126 or tyr 128, resulting in
irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. the structure of

hnqo1 in complex with es936 was previously resolved
(pdb accession code 1kbq). the es936 stacks parallel to
the isoalloxazine ring of the fad and interacts with fad
and residues from both monomers (11). the enzymeinhibitor interactions are mostly hydrophobic contacts, with
only one hydrogen bond between the indolequinone o7 and
tyr 126 (11). alignment of the hnqo1 dimer in complex
with es936 with the hnqo1- xxxd1875xxx  complex yields
0.45 rms deviation for the 546 r-carbon atoms. the only
apparent change in the presence of es936 is in the position
of phe 232 (figure 4c). the movement of phe 232 upon
binding of es936 is more limited compared to the effect of
 xxxd1875xxx . the distance between tyr 128 and phe 232 is
about 8 å in the hnqo1-es936 complex, while the distance
in the hnqo1- xxxd1875xxx  complex increases to about 12
å (table 2). the relative positions of phe 232 and tyr 128

are again highlighted on the surface of  xxxg1592xxx  (figure 5;
compare panels c and d).
comparison of the structure of the hnqo1- xxxd1875xxx 
complex with the rat  xxxg1592xxx - xxxd1689xxx  complex.
 xxxd1689xxx  is a water-soluble triazine dye that binds to
the nucleotide-binding site of many enzymes. it is a
competitive inhibitor of  xxxg1592xxx  with respect to nad(p)h
with a ki of 170 nm. the crystal structure of the rat  xxxg1592xxx 
together with  xxxd1952xxx  and  xxxd1689xxx  (pdb accession
code 1qrd) shows that  xxxd1689xxx  interacts with residues
from both  xxxg1592xxx  monomers (5). alignment of the rat  xxxg1592xxx 
dimer in complex with  xxxd1689xxx  and  xxxd1952xxx  with
the human  xxxg1592xxx - xxxd1875xxx  complex yields 0.75 rms
deviation for the 546 r-carbon atoms. the distance between
residues tyr 128 and phe 232 increases from about 4 å in
the hnqo1- xxxd1952xxx  complex to about 9 å in the rat
 xxxg1592xxx  in complex with  xxxd1689xxx  together with  xxxd1952xxx  (table 2). the movement of tyr 128 and phe 232
in the case of  xxxd1689xxx  is reduced compared to the
changes that occur in the presence of  xxxd1875xxx  (table 2).
however, in contrast to  xxxd1875xxx  and es936, the three
ring moieties of  xxxd1689xxx  are extending outside the
surface of the enzyme (figure 5; compare panel e with panels
c and d).

of the hnqo1- xxxd1875xxx  crystal structure shows that one
coumarin ring of  xxxd1875xxx  stacks parallel to the isoalloxazine ring of fad and forms hydrogen bonds with tyr 128
and his 161. comparison of the hnqo1- xxxd1875xxx 
structure with the apo hnqo1 structure shows that, upon
binding of  xxxd1875xxx , there is a significant movement of
two residues in the catalytic pocket, tyr 128 and phe 232.
this movement is probably critical for the entrance and
binding of  xxxd1875xxx  to the enzyme active site.
our hnqo1- xxxd1875xxx  structure is in line with previous
mutational studies of human and rat  xxxg1592xxx , which shares
86% amino acid sequence homology with human  xxxg1592xxx .
previous mutational analysis of the rat  xxxg1592xxx  showed that
replacement of tyrosine 128 with valine increases the ki value
for  xxxd1875xxx  about 12-fold (22). replacement of tyrosine
128 with  xxxd233xxx  further increases the ki value for
 xxxd1875xxx  about 70-fold (9). our hnqo1- xxxd1875xxx 
structure provides a structural basis for the observation that
tyr 128 is important for  xxxd1875xxx  binding and demonstrates that tyr 128 is positioned in close vicinity to
 xxxd1875xxx  (3.26 å) and forms a hydrogen bond with

asher et al.
 xxxd1875xxx . we also identified another hydrogen bonds
between dicouamrol and his 161. indeed, mutation of his
161 to gln in the human  xxxg1592xxx  increases the ki value for
 xxxd1875xxx  from 0.5 to 70 nm (9). gly 150 is another residue
that plays an important role in the binding of  xxxd1875xxx  to
 xxxg1592xxx . replacement of gly 150 with valine in the rat  xxxg1592xxx 
strongly increases the ki value for  xxxd1875xxx  from 2 to 970
nm (9). our hnqo1-dicouamrol structure clearly shows
that gly 150 is in close vicinity to  xxxd1875xxx  (3.3 å) and
might form a hydrophobic interaction with  xxxd1875xxx .
the crystal structure of hnqo1 in complex with  xxxd1875xxx  also provides insight into the mechanism of  xxxg1592xxx 
interaction with the tumor suppressors p53 and p73r and
with odc, since the binding of  xxxg1592xxx  to these proteins is
disrupted in the presence of  xxxd1875xxx  (16, 18, 21). our
results indicate that the structural changes that occur upon
binding of  xxxd1875xxx  to  xxxg1592xxx  are limited to the active
site of  xxxg1592xxx  (figure 4, panel a). therefore, the ability of
 xxxd1875xxx  to disrupt the binding of  xxxg1592xxx  to p53, p73r,
and odc suggests that the binding is dependent on the active
site conformation. the major changes that occur within the
active site are in positions of tyr 128 and phe 232. the
distance between these two residues significantly increases
from about 5 å in the apo hnqo1 to 12 å in the hnqo1
bound to  xxxd1875xxx . previously, we showed that tyr 128
of  xxxg1592xxx  is essential for p53 and p73r binding because its
replacement by valine or phenylalanine abrogates the binding
to p53 and p73r (18). therefore, we propose that the
observed  xxxd1875xxx -induced conformational changes in the
positions of tyr 128 and phe 232 on the surface of  xxxg1592xxx 
might interfere with the binding of  xxxg1592xxx  to p53, p73r, and
odc.
es936 is a mechanism-based inhibitor that inhibits  xxxg1592xxx 
activity by alkylating either tyrosine 126 or tyrosine 128 in
the active site of  xxxg1592xxx  (11). in contrast to  xxxd1875xxx ,
 xxxd1689xxx , and several other competitive inhibitors of
 xxxg1592xxx  activity, es936 was reported neither to induce p53
degradation nor to inhibit p53- xxxg1592xxx  binding (16, 21). it
is interesting that the hnqo1-es936 structure exhibits a
more limited movement of both tyr128 and phe 232
compared to the hnqo1- xxxd1875xxx  structure. such a
limited movement might be insufficient to disrupt the binding
of  xxxg1592xxx  to p53. while a similar degree of limited movement
was observed in the case of  xxxd1689xxx , that induces p53
degradation although less effectively than  xxxd1875xxx  (16).
however,  xxxd1689xxx  is a larger molecule that extensively
protrudes from the surface of  xxxg1592xxx . this generates additional steric effects that might interfere with the binding
of  xxxg1592xxx  to p53, even if the position of tyr 128 and phe
232 still enables such association. although less effective
than  xxxd1875xxx , several additional  xxxg1592xxx  inhibitors, including chrysin, dhf, and curcumin, block the ability of  xxxg1592xxx 
to stabilize its interacting proteins (16, 21). the resolution
of the  xxxg1592xxx  structure in complex with these different
inhibitors should provide useful information to substantiate
the proposed model.
we have previously shown that the binding of  xxxg1592xxx  to
p53 and p73r is increased in the presence of nadh.
 xxxd1875xxx  disrupts the binding of  xxxg1592xxx  to p53 and p73r
and induces ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation
of these proteins (18). several other competitive inhibitors
of  xxxg1592xxx , which compete with nadh, induce p53 degrada-

crystal structure of  xxxg1592xxx - xxxd1875xxx 
tion and inhibit p53-dependent apoptosis (16). thus, nadh
not only serves as an electron donor in the enzymatic activity
of  xxxg1592xxx  but also promotes the binding of  xxxg1592xxx  to p53
and p73r possibly by inducing a conformation that favors
these interactions. it is also possible that  xxxg1592xxx -associated
nadh plays a direct role in binding of the client proteins.
the binding of  xxxg1592xxx  to p73r is mediated via its
c-terminal sam domain. p73beta, a p73 isoform that lacks the
c-terminal sam domain, does not bind to  xxxg1592xxx  whereas
the c-terminal sam domain itself is sufficient for  xxxg1592xxx 
binding (18). p53 shares significant homology with p73, in
particular with p73beta, and does not harbor a sam domain;
however, it binds  xxxg1592xxx  with affinity similar to that of p73r
(18). furthermore, the “hot spot” p53 mutants, p53 r175h
and p53 r273h, exhibit increased binding of  xxxg1592xxx  compared to wild-type p53, and the ability of  xxxd1875xxx  to
disrupt their binding to  xxxg1592xxx  is reduced (12, 16). finally,
 xxxg1592xxx  also binds the enzyme odc which does not share
any significant structural homology with p53 or p73r (19).
however, the fact that  xxxd1875xxx  disrupts the binding of
these different proteins to  xxxg1592xxx  suggests that they all share
a common binding site on  xxxg1592xxx  (18, 19). thus, it seems
that a defined region within  xxxg1592xxx  is capable of binding
different protein substrates with different structural requirements.
the crystal structure of hnqo1- xxxd1875xxx  described
here and the comparison to the  xxxg1592xxx  structure in the
presence of other  xxxg1592xxx  inhibitors provide a useful tool for
understanding the mechanism of action of the different
inhibitors and for the development and identification of
additional potent inhibitors of  xxxg1592xxx  activity. furthermore,
analysis of the hnqo1- xxxd1875xxx  structure provides the
first step in the molecular understanding of  xxxg1592xxx  interaction
with p53 and other short-lived proteins.
