the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar)
is a member of the steroid nuclear receptor superfamily. three types of ppars have been described in humans:  xxxg1805xxx ,  xxxg1806xxx , and  xxxg1807xxx . here we investigated the levels of  xxxg1805xxx  mrna in primary cultures
of human umbilical venous endothelial cells (huvec),
human umbilical arterial endothelial cells (huaec),
human coronary arterial endothelial cells (hcaec),
and human aortic endothelial cells (haec), using the
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rtpcr). the huvec, haec, and hcaec, but not the
huaec, showed relatively low expression of  xxxg1805xxx 
in comparison with liver, which was used as a positive
control. moreover, the partial sequences of the pcramplified products from huvec, haec, and hcaec
were similar to that of the  xxxg1805xxx  from human liver.
the expression of  xxxg1805xxx  in cultured haec, which
were induced by dexamethasone, was inhibited by insulin. in addition,  xxxg1805xxx  expression was also increased by  xxxd331xxx  or  xxxd2318xxx  with
the physiological concentration. these results suggest
that the  xxxg1805xxx  in endothelial cells may have the same
physiological role as the expression of  xxxg1805xxx  in the
liver. q 1998 academic press

the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar)

nantly catabolized.  xxxg1805xxx  is activated by medium,
long, and very long chain  xxxd2154xxx , polyunsaturated
fatty acid (pufa), such as  xxxd2318xxx  (epa),
and a variety of hypolipidemic fibrates such as  xxxd331xxx  (3),  xxxd1724xxx ,  xxxd2096xxx  (4), and gemfibrozil (5).
moreover, the  xxxg1805xxx  gene is physiologically regulated
by dexamethasone and insulin in hepatic cells (6).
recently, we reported that a high-fat diet containing
a variety of  xxxd2154xxx , such as  xxxd2681xxx  ( xxxd2681xxx ),
 xxxd2777xxx  (c18:1, v-9), linoleic acid (c18:2, v-6), or epa
(c20:5, v-3), alters the plasma level of thiobarbituric
acid-reactive substance (tbars) in association with
expression of the  xxxg1805xxx  gene in the liver (3). furthermore, the administration of  xxxd331xxx  increases the
expression of the cu2/, zn2/-superoxide dismutase
(sod) gene in the rat liver and there is a positive correlation between cu2/, zn2/-sod expression and the
liver  xxxg1805xxx  mrna level (7). in addition, peters et al.
(8) reported that the lipoprotein metabolic pathway is
altered in  xxxg1805xxx -deficient mice. it has been reported
that  xxxg1805xxx  affects the duration of inflammation induced by leukotriene b4/ xxxd208xxx  (9). these
findings suggest that the  xxxg1805xxx  might be involved in
the pathophysiology of hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis
and inflammation.
atherosclerosis and inflammation involve a variety
cell types: endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle
cells, monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes and platelets. among these, endothelial cells play a crucial role
in the regulation of platelet function, coagulation, and
vascular tone, and they initiate the inflammatory response. interestingly, endothelial dysfunction occurs at
an early stage in this disease, particularly when cardiovascular risk factors such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension and diabetes are present. thus, it is important to
investigate the function of endothelial cells to clarify
the mechanism of atherosclerosis and inflammation.
in this study, we investigated whether or not the
mrna for  xxxg1805xxx , which plays an important role in

lipid metabolism, is expressed in cultured endothelial
cells from four distinct vascular beds: human umbilical
venous endothelial cells (huvec), human umbilical
arterial endothelial cells (huaec), human coronary
arterial endothelial cells (hcaec), and human aortic
endothelial cells (haec). we also examined whether
the mrna for  xxxg1805xxx  is regulated by dexamethasone,
insulin,  xxxd331xxx , or epa in endothelial cells as well
as in the liver. next, using polymerase chain reaction
single-strand conformation polymorphism (pcr-sscp)
method, we surveyed the mutations of the  xxxg1805xxx  gene
of neutrophils which were obtained from patients with
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, or/and coronary heart disease. moreover, we determined the full-length sequences of the amplified pcr
products from huvec, haec, and hcaec and compared them with that of the  xxxg1805xxx  from human liver
by a direct sequence method.
materials and methods
primary cultures of huaec (lot# 30402), hcaec (lot# ri 377),
and haec (lot# ri 375) were purchased from a commercial source
(cell systems corporation, kirkland, wa, usa). in addition, huvec
were obtained from two commercial sources (lot# 31091, cell systems
corporation; lot# mp-huv-ec-4, dainippon pharmaceutical co.,
ltd., osaka, japan). additional huvec were obtained from five
umbilical cord veins (10). cells were checked for their ability to produce factor viii-related antigen by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. all cells were identified as endothelial cells. cell cultures
were maintained in 25-cm2 flasks in a commercial medium (cs-4zo500, dainippon pharmaceutical co., ltd.) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, hepes (15 mm), acidic-fibroblast growth factor
(fgf), and heparin in an atmosphere of 5% co2 and 95% air at 377c.
at confluence, the cell population was divided after the cells were
detached from the flasks with 0.24% edta. the medium was
changed twice weekly. all cultures were used within 3 weeks, at the
third to fifth passage.
as a positive control for  xxxg1805xxx  expression, human liver was obtained from non-obese non-diabetic adult subjects who were undergoing surgery. the tissue samples were immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen and were stored at 0807c until extraction of the total rna.
cell treatments. dexamethasone (0.25 mm), insulin (0.4 mm) or
both were added to the cultured haec for 3 days. dexamethasone
was also observed at a final concentration of 1.25 mm.
sodium-epa (epa-na) (mochida pharmaceutical co., ltd., tokyo,
japan) was also added, at a final concentration of 10 mm, 30 mm, or
300 mm, to the cultured haec. the level of epa as free fatty acid
in normal human plasma is usually about mean 20 mm. the medium
containing epa-na was replaced with fresh medium every day.
sodium- xxxd331xxx  ( xxxd331xxx -na) (kissei pharmaceutical co.,

ltd., matsumoto, japan) was used at a final concentration of 30 mm,
which is within the range of plasma concentrations seen in patients
with hyperlipidemia.
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). total
tissue rna was isolated from huvec, huaec, hcaec, or haec
(107 cells) and liver using a commercial kit (isogen, nippon gene
co. ltd., toyama, japan). preliminary experiments had shown that
 xxxg1805xxx  mrna expression was low, and that accurate measurements
would not be possible by northern blot analysis. we therefore performed a rt-pcr procedure to determine the  xxxg1805xxx  expression
levels. total rna was used as a template for dna synthesis using
an oligo(dt) primer and a dna cycle kit (geneamp rna pcr kit,
perkin elmer, new jersey, usa) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. the rt reaction was performed twice at 427c for 15
min to maximize cdna synthesis, and it was then terminated by
heating at 997c for 5 min. the resulting cdna was used as the
template for pcr.
oligonucleotide primers for  xxxg1805xxx  rt-pcr were designed to amplify eight partial cdna sequences covering the full-length of the
transcriptional element (fig. 1). the synthetic oligonucleotides were
obtained from nippon flour mills co., ltd. (kanagawa japan). we
chose glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ) mrna
as an internal control (3, 7).
pcr reactions were performed using the same temperatures as
for denaturation (947c, 30 s) and extension (727c, 90 s), but the
annealing temperature was 507c for 50 s; the number of amplification cycles was 28 and 33. the pcr products were analyzed by poly-

pcr-sscp. to screen for mutations of the  xxxg1805xxx  mrna, neutrophils were obtained from 40 patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, or/and coronary heart disease
and were analyzed by pcr-sscp (11).
dna sequencing. the amplified pcr product was extracted using
a commercial purification system (easytrap ver.2, takara shuzo co.,

the pt7blue t-vector (novagen, inc., madison, wi, usa) using a
commercial kit (dna ligation kit ver.2, takara shuzo co., ltd.).
the ligated dnas were used to transfect bacterial cells, and colonies
containing exogenous dna were grown individually for plasmid
preparation. the partial huvec, haec or hcaec  xxxg1805xxx  dna
inserts in the cloning vectors were sequenced with a fluorescencebased automated sequencer (abi prism 310 genetic analyzer, perkin elmer, forster city, ca). all dna sequences were confirmed by
reading both dna strands.

discussion
in the present study, we demonstrated that the
 xxxg1805xxx  gene is expressed in huvec, hcaec, and
haec, but not in huaec. expression of  xxxg1805xxx  in
the liver, retina, digestive mucosa, proximal tubules of
the kidney, heart, muscle and brown adipose tissue
has been reported previously (2). the  xxxg1805xxx  gene is
expressed predominantly in liver tissue, and the
 xxxg1805xxx  protein participates in the process of fatty acid
degradation, including v- and b-oxidation. in addition,
it has been reported that  xxxg1805xxx  might regulate the
genes encoding mitochondrial  xxxd32xxx  synthase (12), and the apoproteins a-i (13),

a-ii (14) and c-iii (15).  xxxg1805xxx  is activated by a variety
of  xxxd2154xxx  (16) and hypolipidemic fibrates such as
 xxxd331xxx  (3),  xxxd1724xxx ,  xxxd2096xxx  (4), and gemfibrozil (5). our findings indicate that peroxisome proliferators, such as  xxxd331xxx  and epa, in the bloodstream might directly affect  xxxg1805xxx  expression in endothelial cell as well affecting  xxxg1805xxx  expression in the
liver. administration of  xxxd331xxx  decreases the
plasma free fatty acid (ffa) and triglyceride levels,
and it has been reported that elevation of the ffa level
in plasma impairs endothelial-dependent vasodilation
(17). moreover, davda et al. (18) reported that ffa
 xxxd2777xxx  reduces the activity of endothelial  xxxd2738xxx 
synthase (nos) in vitro. by contrast, okuda et al. (19)
reported that epa enhances  xxxd2738xxx  (no) production by huvec. it seems likely that fatty acid affects
huvec, resulting in modulation of vasodilation. the
difference in the effect on huvec might be due to the
chain lengths and degrees of unsaturation of fatty acid.
there are the increase in  xxxg1805xxx  mrna levels with
increasing chain length and number of double bonds of
fatty acid. thus, fatty acid might operate directly and
pleotropically in endothelial cells, although the mechanism responsible for ffa-induced endothelial dysfunction is still unclear. moreover, hypolipidemic fibrates
such as  xxxd331xxx , which increases the level of  xxxg1805xxx 
mrna, might operate directly in endothelial cells.
our present data indicate that the mrna for  xxxg1805xxx 
in human vascular endothelial cells might be regulated
by dexamethasone or insulin. the expression of  xxxg1805xxx 
in cultured haec, which was induced by dexamethasone, was inhibited by insulin. by contrast, the treatment by insulin only tended to increase the  xxxg1805xxx 
mrna level in haec but this effect did not reach significance (figure 4, 5). in fact, it has been reported that
 xxxg1805xxx  (20) and  xxxg1807xxx  (21) are activated by insulininduced ppar phosphorylation. by contrast, hu et al.
(22) reported that adipogenesis is inhibited by phosphorylation of  xxxg1807xxx . although the details of  xxxg1805xxx  regulation by insulin are still unclear, it would be interesting

to know how insulin and insulin precursors are associated with the pathophysiology of hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, and inflammation through endothelial  xxxg1805xxx 
regulation.
in the present study, we observed regional differences in the expression of  xxxg1805xxx  mrna by endothelial
cells under basal conditions without a stimulus. arterial endothelial cells differ from venous endothelial
cells in some aspects such as their response to cytokine
stimulation (23). although the mechanism for this difference is unknown, it might be due to the difference
in the partial pressure of oxygen (po2) in the bloodstream. gregg and weiner (24) reported the variation
in the po2 : aorta or coronary artery ú umbilical vein
(34.6 { 3 (mean { sd) mmhg at gestational age 3435.9 weeks) ú umbilical artery (23.7 { 2.8 (mean {
sd) mmhg at gestational age 37-42 weeks). the po2 in
the umbilical artery is lower than that in the umbilical
vein (24). thus, huaec might be exposed to less oxidative stress than haec, hcaec, and huvec. endothelial cells themselves can release both •o20 and h2o2 .
these reactive oxygen species are metabolized to h2o
and o2 by catalase and cu2/, zn2/-sod, which are expressed in huvec (25) as well as in the liver. catalase
is the main enzyme in peroxisomes, while cu2/, zn2/sod is present in peroxisomes at lower a concentration
than in the cytoplasm (26). the activation of peroxisomes with induction of  xxxg1805xxx  might result in the
enhancement of the expression of the genes for both
catalase and cu2/, zn2/-sod.
in the present study, we have shown that  xxxg1805xxx 
mrna is expressed in endothelial cells and neutrophils
in addition to the liver. although further studies should
be done to clarify whether the  xxxg1805xxx  gene in endothelial cells and neutrophils confers some benefit in preventing vascular complications, it is likely that  xxxg1805xxx 
in endothelial cells and neutrophils plays a regulatory
role in the pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis, and also in the processes of inflammation (9)
and coagulation.
