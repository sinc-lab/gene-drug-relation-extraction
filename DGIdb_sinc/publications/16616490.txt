abstract—experimental evidences have conﬁrmed that matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) play a fundamental role in a wide variety
of pathologic conditions and recent advances in medicinal chemistry approach to the design of mmp inhibitors with desired structural and functional properties. among mmps,  xxxg1440xxx  has demonstrated to play a major role in the establishment of metastases
and it is substantially increased in the majority of malignant tumors. inhibition of  xxxg1440xxx  is thought to have a therapeutic beneﬁt to
cancer. results of this study present a novel synthetic  xxxg1440xxx  inhibitor that downregulates  xxxg1440xxx  expression level in ht1080,
human ﬁbrosarcoma cells.

the proteolytic degradation of extracellular matrix
(ecm) proteins has long been described in association
with both normal tissue remodeling and pathologic conditions. the matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), which
represents a family of major matrix degrading enzymes
play a central role in the breakdown of these structural
proteins.1 mmps share certain biochemical properties,
yet each has distinct substrate speciﬁcity and up to date
several mammalian enzymes have been identiﬁed ranging from well-characterized enzymes such as collagenase, stremolysin, gelatinase and more recently
described membrane type mmps.2 under normal physiological processes mmp expression and activity are
carefully regulated and loss of control of mmp activity
appears to have serious consequences and aberrations in
mmp expression have been associated with several diseases.3 in this context, mmp inhibitors have been
caught the interest as an important new class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of diseases characterized
by remodeling and excessive ecm degradation.
among mmps,  xxxg1440xxx  ( xxxg1440xxx , 92 kda) is an
important member of the mmp family and is involved
in the cleavage of all types of denatured collagens and

of native basement membrane proteins.4 studies have
shown that  xxxg1440xxx  levels are signiﬁcantly elevated during the metastatic progression of malignant tumors5
since it requires proteolytic degradation of ecm components in basement membrane and stroma tissues.
ht1080 cells, a human ﬁbrosarcoma cell line have been
used extensively as a model to study  xxxg1440xxx  activity
and expression.6 similar to various other malignant tumors these cells express  xxxg1440xxx  at a higher level. studies on the promoter of  xxxg1440xxx  have clearly identiﬁed
that its transcription is mediated mainly via  xxxg1222xxx  binding interactions.7 compounds that
interfere the up-regulation of  xxxg1440xxx  expression can
remarkably decrease the total  xxxg1440xxx  activity and identiﬁcation of  xxxg1440xxx  inhibitors is of current interest.
the earliest mmp inhibitors were peptide derivatives
designed from the knowledge of the amino acid sequence of collagen at the site of cleavage by collagenase.
with the development in the ﬁeld, medicinal chemists
focused away from the peptidic inhibitors because of
the diﬃculties in obtaining good oral activity and lack
of speciﬁcity for mmps. as a result, a number of nonpeptidic inhibitors have been discovered by highthroughput screening of natural product and also potent
mmp inhibitors have been synthesized with desirable
chemical functional groups.8
glucosamine is an amino monosaccharide found in
chitin, glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans such as

 xxxd2289xxx  and heparan sulfate. most of the clinical
studies investigating medical eﬀects of glucosamine have
used glucosamine sulfate and a great trend exists to use
it for treating osteoarthritis.9 recently results of some
studies suggested that,  xxxd2683xxx  has shown
promise for treating inﬂammatory bowel diseases such
as crohn disease and ulcerative colitis and also glucosamine has been proposed to be important for healthy
skin.10 however, reports on synthesis of other derivatives of glucosamine and identiﬁcation of their plausible
biological activities cannot be found so often. results of
this study present the potent inhibitory potential of carboxy derivatized glucosamine on activity and expression
of  xxxg1440xxx  in ht1080 cells.
chemicals required for synthesis, including succinic
anhydride were obtained from sigma chemical co.
(st. louis, mo, usa). ht1080 cells were obtained from
american type culture collection (manassas, va,
usa). all the materials required for culturing of cells
including cell culture media were purchased from gibco
brl, life technologies (usa). fitc-gelatin (cln100) was obtained from collagen technology corporation (tokyo, japan). mtt reagent, gelatin, agarose,
doxycycline, pma ( xxxd2925xxx )
were purchased from sigma chemical co. (st. louis,
mo, usa).
the n-carboxybutyrylation reaction was carried out
according to ronghua et al.11 with slight modiﬁcations.
brieﬂy, glucosamine hydrochloride (2 g) was dissolved
in 10 ml of distilled water and 15 ml of methanol
was added while stirring. a determined quantity of succinic anhydride to obtain the same molar ratio (1 g) was
dissolved in acetone and added drop by drop at room
temperature for 1 h. the mixture was stirred for 4 h
and ph was maintained at 9.0–10.0 with  xxxd3212xxx  throughout the reaction. subsequently, the solution
was puriﬁed and lyophilized to obtain ﬂuﬀy, yellow,
light solid products.
proton nmr (1h nmr) and carbon nmr (13c nmr)
spectra were recorded in a d2o environment on a
jnm-ecp-400 (400 mhz) spectrometer (jeol, japan).
elemental analysis (c, n and h) was performed using an
elementar analysesysteme, (elementar vario, el, usa)
and were within ±0.4% of theoretical values. infrared
spectra were recorded using kbr plates in spectrum
2000 ft-ir spectrophotometer (perkin-elmer, usa).
human ﬁbrosarcoma cells (ht1080) were cultured in
dmem supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
2 mm glutamine and 100 lg/ml penicillin–streptomycin. for experiments, cells were detached with trypsin–
edta and plated onto 24- or 96-well plates at a plating
density of 7· 105 and 1.5· 105 per well, separately.
equal number of ht1080 cells (4000 cells per well) cultured in 96-well plates with serum and serum free media
were treated with various concentrations of cglc for
24 h. cell viability was then evaluated with 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (mtt)
spectrophotometrically (genios microplate reader,

tecan austria gmbh, austria) which measures conversion of tetrazolium salt into blue formazan by viable
cells. absorbance of soluble mtt formazan products
was measured at 540 nm.
 xxxg1440xxx  activity in ht1080 cells was assayed by gelatin
zymography as described previously.12 for this, approximately 2· 105 cells/ml ht1080 cells in serum free
dmem medium were seeded in 24-well plates and
pre-treated with diﬀerent concentrations of cglc for
1 h.  xxxg1440xxx  expression was stimulated by treatment of
pma (10 ng/ml) and cells were cultured for 48 h. cell
conditioned medium was subjected to substrate gel electrophoresis. similar amount of protein containing conditioned media were applied without reduction to a
10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel impregnated with 1 mg/
ml gelatin. after electrophoresis, gel was washed in
50 mm tris–hcl (ph 7.5) containing 2.5% triton x100 at room temperature and incubated overnight at
37 c in zymography developing buﬀer containing
10 mm cacl2, 50 mm tris–hcl and 150 mm nacl.
the gel was then stained with a solution of 0.1%
coomassie blue. in this assay clear zones against the
blue background indicate the presence of gelatinolytic
activity. the image of the gel was recorded using
fujiﬁlm image reader las-3000 software in science
image system, las 3000 (fujiﬁlm life science, tokyo,
japan). the gelatinolytic activities were quantiﬁed using
multi gauge v3.0 software.
ht1080 cells grown in 24-well plates were treated with
diﬀerent concentrations of cglc and conditioned media
were collected by centrifugation at 13,000g following
pma (10 ng/ml) treatment. enzyme activities of conditioned media in 50 mmo/l tris–hcl buﬀer (ph 7.5),
0.15 mol/l nacl, 10 mmol/l cacl2, 0.02% nan3
(tnc buﬀer) containing 0.05% brij 35 were determined
using ﬂuorescence conjugated gelatin peptide (collagen
technology corporation, tokyo, japan) as the substrate.13 fluoropeptides were incubated with conditioned media at 37 c for 20 h, and the reaction was
terminated by addition of 3% acetic acid. fluorescence
intensity was measured at 495 nm (excitation) and
520 nm (emission) with a genios ﬂuorescence microplate reader (tecan austria gmbh, austria).
ht1080 cells cultured in 10 cm culture dishes were transiently transfected with  xxxg1440xxx  promoter containing
 xxxg2041xxx  luciferase reporter vector (promega, madison,
wi) or ap-1 binding site containing luciferase reporter
plasmid (colontech, palo alto, canada) by lipofectamine 2000tm reagent (invitrogen). b-galactosidase
expression vector was co-transfected with the reporter
vector to serve as an internal control of transfection eﬃciency. transfected cells sub-cultured in 24-well plates
were treated with diﬀerent concentrations of cglc.
following stimulation with pma cells were cultured for
24 h. cells were washed once with cold pbs and lysed with
200 ll/well lysis buﬀer (25 mm tri–hcl, ph 8.0, containing 2 mm ddt and 1% triton-x 100). aliquots of
cell lysate and luciferase substrate (promega) were mixed
in equal amounts in a 96-well plate and luminescence
intensity was measured with a luminescence microplate

e. mendis et al. / bioorg. med. chem. lett. 16 (2006) 3105–3110

reader (tecan austria gmbh, austria). b-galactosidase
activity was measured with onpg buﬀer. the level of
reporter gene expression was determined as a ratio,
compared with cells stimulated by pma (10 ng/ml) alone
and represented as relative luciferase activity.
transfection eﬃciency was determined by x-gal staining method. brieﬂy, transfected cells were ﬁxed with
0.5% glutaraldehyde and stained with x-gal solution
containing 20 mm k3fe(cn)6, k4fe(cn)6 and 1 mm
mgcl2. after 24 h of incubation at 37 c, transfected
cells were visualized with blue color under a light
microscope.
data were expressed as means ± standard error of the
mean (n = 3). student’s t-test was used to determine
the level of signiﬁcance at p < 0.05.
in the present study, glucosamine was chemically modiﬁed to obtain cglc (scheme 1) and the reaction was carried out under mild conditions to rule out possibilities
for adverse inﬂuences on structural changes. therefore,
the substitution of –ooc–ch2ch2–co–n– was predominantly under control. substitution of –ooc–
ch2ch2–co– group to glucosamine was clearly conﬁrmed by ft-ir spectra, elemental analysis, 13c
nmr and 1h nmr of cglc. in comparison to the
ft-ir spectrum of glc (fig. 1a), both symmetric and
asymmetric stretch absorptions of carboxyl groups
(1560 and 1410 cm 1, respectively) in spectrum of cglc
(fig. 1b) conﬁrmed the successful introduction of the
new group.11,14,15 data obtained from elemental analysis greatly strengthened the new structural features

3107

observed in ft-ir spectra and are in agreement with
the calculated elemental composition (table 1). information of 13c nmr spectra of the derivative was also
in agreement with ft-ir spectra and clearly conﬁrmed
the substitution of carboxyl groups to cglc. in 13c
nmr spectra of glc, characteristic peaks (d 93 ppm,
c-1; d 54 ppm, c-2; d 69 ppm, c-3, d 72 ppm, c-4; d
76 ppm, c-5, d 60 ppm, c-6) were clearly observed.
compared to glc, cglc presented some new chemical
shifts that can be assigned to coch2ch2coo– group
at d 180 ppm, d 177 ppm and d 32 ppm (assigned to
the carbonyl carbon –coo, –co and –ch2ch2–,
respectively).11,16 further, 1h nmr spectrum of cglc
was used to conﬁrm the existence of substituted groups
compared to 1h nmr spectrum of glc (2.9, 3.2, 3.8 and
4.5 (c-1-6)). a new chemical shift that appeared in
spectrum of cglc-3 at d 2.5 ppm was assigned to
protons of –coch2ch2co– groups.
to analyze the inhibition of  xxxg1440xxx  mediated gelatinolytic activity in conditioned medium stimulated with
pma, we utilized human ﬁbrosarcoma cell line,
ht1080. similar to various other malignant tumors,
these ht1080 cells express  xxxg1440xxx  at a higher level.6
when pma was administered to ht1080 cells at
10 ng/ml concentration  xxxg1440xxx  activity increased by
approximately 60% (fig. 2). size and the intensity of
the lytic zone were greatly reduced in the presence of
cglc and it clearly indicated that  xxxg1440xxx  activity in
ht1080 cells was markedly inhibited in the presence
of cglc. moreover, inhibitory eﬀect of cglc on
 xxxg1440xxx  showed a concentration dependant pattern
and at concentration 500 lg/ml, cglc showed

the  xxxg1440xxx  inhibitory eﬀect of cglc on  xxxg1440xxx  activity stimulated by pma in ht1080 cells was further conﬁrmed using more sensitive ﬂuorescence conjugated
gelatin digestion assay which use ﬂuorescence conjugated gelatin peptides as the substrate for  xxxg1440xxx . the
amount of active gelatinases ( xxxg1440xxx /-2) present in
cglc-treated stimulated conditioned medium obtained
from incubation of ht1080 cells was assessed using
the resulting ﬂuorescence activity. as we observed clearly in gelatin zymography stimulated with pma, ht1080
cells secrete mainly  xxxg1440xxx  and expression of other gelatinases including  xxxg1428xxx  are negligible. therefore, it
can be presumed that diﬀerence in ﬂuorescence intensities was mainly due to activity of  xxxg1440xxx . the inhibitory results obtained in the presence of cglc were in well
agreement with zymography results, where dose-dependent  xxxg1440xxx  inhibition was observed with increment
of concentration of cglc (fig. 4). at 500 lg/ml concentration of cglc, relative ﬂuorescence intensity was

decreased by 66% and when cglc was treated at 100 lg/
ml concentration about 50% reduction of ﬂuorescence
intensity was observed.
to extend these observations to interactions within the
context of transcriptional regulation, we assessed the effect of cglc on expression of  xxxg1440xxx  using  xxxg1440xxx 
promoter luciferase construct. a high (about 4-fold)
luciferase activity was noted in control cells stimulated
with pma and it was well correlated with zymography.
however, the activity of the  xxxg1440xxx -luciferase reporter
gene was inhibited nearly 3-fold in the cells treated with
cglc at 500 lg/ml concentration (fig. 5a). approximately 50% inhibition was resulted from 100 lg/ml
concentration of cglc and inhibition followed a dosedependant pattern. we were curious to know whether
the  xxxg1440xxx  transcription suppression eﬀect of cglc
had any correlation to ap-1 transcription. because the
promoter region of the  xxxg1440xxx  contains an ap-1 binding consensus site upstream from the start site and transcriptional induction of  xxxg1440xxx  has been demonstrated
to be essentially mediated via binding of  xxxg1222xxx  to promoter.7 therefore, to investigate
whether cglc exerts its eﬀect by interfering  xxxg1222xxx  binding we transfected cells with ap-1
binding site containing luciferase constructs. reporter
activity in pma stimulated group was increased by
approximately 3-fold whereas reporter activity was suppressed between 2- and 3-fold once the cells were treated
with cglc at 500 lg/ml concentration (fig. 5b). and
the suppression followed a clear dose-dependant pattern. taken together; these experiments suggest that
cglc suppresses  xxxg1440xxx  expression via suppression of
ap-1 expression.
to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to demonstrate
the activity of glucosamine derivative that can inhibit
the  xxxg1440xxx  activity and expression. many of synthetic
and natural mmp inhibitors identiﬁed so far have proven their capability to direct inhibition of mmp enzymatic activities due to presence of desirable functional

groups.8 compounds that can exert an eﬀect at transcriptional level could be expected to have a promising
potential to develop potent inhibitors since that can
interfere the up-regulation of  xxxg1440xxx  expression and
thereby can remarkably decrease the total mmp activity. therefore, cglc represents a potential synthetic
 xxxg1440xxx  expression inhibitor that warrants further
investigation.
