abstract
the present study was carried out to characterize h-adrenoceptor subtypes mediating relaxation of rat abdominal aorta smooth muscle.
(  )- xxxd2398xxx  and a nonconventional h3-adrenoceptor agonist, ( f )-[4-[3-[(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]-2-hydroxypropoxy]-1,3-dihydro2h-benzimidazol-2-one] hydrochloride (( f )-cgp12177a), induced concentration-dependent relaxation of (  )-phenylephrine (0.3 am)
preconstricted spiral preparations. pretreatment with a combination of ( f )-2-hydroxy-5-[2-[[2-hydroxy-3-[4-[1-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)1h-imidazol-2-yl]phenoxy]propyl]amino]ethoxy]-benzamide methanesulfonate (cgp20712a, a selective h1-adrenoceptor antagonist) and
( f )-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1h-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol hydrochloride (ici-118,5511, a selective h2-adrenoceptor antagonist) (0.1 am for each) produced a 14-fold rightward shift of the concentration – response curve for (  )- xxxd2398xxx ; however,
the relaxation in response to ( f )-cgp12177a was unaffected by the blockade of h1- and h2-adrenoceptors. in the presence of cgp20712a
and ici-118,551 (0.1 am for each), the concentration – response curves for (  )- xxxd2398xxx  and ( f )-cgp12177a were shifted to the right by
a nonselective h1-, h2- and h3-adrenoceptor antagonist, ( f )- xxxd384xxx  (3 and 10 am). these results clearly suggest that h3-adrenoceptors are
involved in h-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation of rat abdominal aorta smooth muscle.

1. introduction
adrenoceptors were originally classified into a- and hadrenoceptors by ahlquist (1948). subsequently, h-adrenoceptors were subclassified into h1- and h2-adrenoceptors based on the relative potency of a series of
sympathomimetic amines in various organ systems (lands
et al., 1967a,b). the authors proposed that vasodilatation
in response to the stimulation of h-adrenoceptors was
basically mediated through h2-adrenoceptors (lands et
al., 1967a,b). thus, h2-adrenoceptors in a number of
vascular smooth muscles are considered to play a predominant role in the regulation of vascular tone. however,
later studies using more selective agonists and antagonists
indicated that h1-adrenoceptors mainly participate in the

relaxation of coronary artery (o’donnell and wanstall,
1984a) and cerebral artery (edvinsson and owman, 1974),
and that rat thoracic aorta and rat pulmonary artery
contain a mixed population of h1- and h2-adrenoceptors,
both mediating relaxation (o’donnell and wanstall, 1981,
1984b).
recently, pharmacological studies and molecular cloning
techniques have revealed that atypical h-adrenoceptors
including h3-adrenoceptors, which are different from classical h1- and h2-adrenoceptors, are the predominant hadrenoceptors mediating both lipolysis in adipocytes (hollenga and zaagsma, 1989) and intestinal relaxation (koike
and takayanagi, 1998; manara et al., 1995; roberts et al.,
1999). in vascular smooth muscles, likewise, the involvement of such a ‘‘third h-adrenoceptor subtype’’ in hadrenoceptor-mediated relaxation was suggested by the
following results obtained in several tissues.  xxxd2957xxx ,
which acts as a potent h1- and h2-adrenoceptor antagonist
with h3-adrenoceptor agonistic activity (arch and kau-

mann, 1993; horinouchi and koike, 2001a,b), elicited
relaxation of canine mesenteric vessel (clark and bertholet,
1983) and rat aorta (doggrell, 1990), and these relaxant
responses to  xxxd2957xxx  were not significantly antagonized by
propranolol, a nonselective h1- and h2-adrenoceptor antagonist. thus, the presence of further h-adrenoceptor subtypes
different from conventional h1- and h2-adrenoceptors was
predictable from their pharmacological characteristics. following this finding, propranolol-resistant relaxations in
response to the stimulation of putative h3- and/or atypical
h-adrenoceptors with (  )- xxxd2398xxx  and a nonconventional partial h3-adrenoceptor agonist, ( f )-cgp12177a,
were observed in a few vascular smooth muscles, including
rat carotid artery (macdonald et al., 1999; oriowo, 1994,
1995) and rat thoracic aorta (brawley et al., 2000a,b;
oriowo, 1995). in this way, evidence has now accumulated
for the presence of h3- and/or atypical h-adrenoceptors in
the vascular system.
the present study was therefore carried out to characterize h-adrenoceptors mediating relaxation to (  )- xxxd2398xxx  and ( f )-cgp12177a in rat abdominal aorta smooth
muscle, with a special attention being paid to the possible
contribution of h3-adrenoceptors. our present findings demonstrate that the activation of h3-adrenoceptors produces
potent relaxation in rat abdominal aorta and their characteristics in vascular smooth muscle appears to differ from those
of well-characterized h3-adrenoceptors in gastrointestinal
smooth muscles.

removed by gentle rubbing of the intimal surface with a
cotton swab. endothelium removal was functionally confirmed by the absence of relaxation in response to acetylcholine (10 am) in spiral preparations precontracted with
(  )-phenylephrine (0.3 am). two spiral preparations were
obtained from each aorta. these preparations were
mounted vertically under an initial resting tension of 10
mn in a 20-ml organ bath containing krebs solution
composed as follows (mm): nacl, 118; kcl, 4.75;
 xxxg2125xxx  2 2h 2 o, 2.54; mgso 4 , 1.20; kh 2 po 4 , 1.19;
nahco3, 25.0 and d-(+)-glucose, 11.0. krebs solution
was oxygenated continuously with a mixture of 95% o2
and 5% co2 and maintained at 37 jc (ph = 7.4). the
following drugs were present in the bath solution throughout the experiments: indomethacin (10 am, a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor) and l- xxxd228xxx  (10 am, an antioxidant for
catecholamines).

2. materials and methods

after equilibration for 30 min, (  )-phenylephrine was
added cumulatively until a maximal contractile response
was observed. the contraction induced by (  )-phenylephrine is expressed as a percentage of the maximal contraction
produced by (  )-phenylephrine (0.3 am). to assess the
antagonistic effect of  xxxd2914xxx , the antagonist was
added to the bath 30 min before the addition of (  )phenylephrine. the concentration – response curves for
(  )-phenylephrine were then obtained in the presence of
 xxxd2914xxx .

2.1. animals
male wistar rats weighing 150– 200 g (murai experimental animals, saitama, japan) were used in the present
study. animals were housed under a 12-h light/dark cycle
(lights on 8:00 a.m.; lights off 8:00 p.m.) and had free
access to standard laboratory food and tap water. the room
temperature and relative air humidity were strictly regulated at 22– 24 jc and 50– 60%, respectively. the present
study was performed according to the guideline for the
care and use of laboratory animals of toho university
school of pharmaceutical sciences (which is accredited by
the ministry of education, culture, sports, science and
technology, japan), and the protocol of the present study
was approved by the institutional animal care and use
committee.
2.2. tissue preparation
rats were stunned and killed by cervical dislocation.
the abdominal aorta was isolated immediately and carefully cleaned of fat and connective tissues. the abdominal
aorta was spirally cut into sections approximately 15 mm
in length and 1 mm in width. the endothelium was

2.3. measurement of tension changes
isometric tension changes of the muscle preparation were
recorded with a force –displacement transducer (tb-612t,
nihon kohden, tokyo, japan) connected to a carrier amplifier (ap-621g, nihon kohden). preparations were allowed
to equilibrate for 30 min before the start of experimental
procedures.
2.4. assessment of the effect of  xxxd2914xxx  against
vasocontraction induced by ()-phenylephrine

2.5. assessment of vasorelaxation induced by ()- xxxd2398xxx  and (f)-cgp12177a
after equilibration of smooth muscle preparations for 30
min, each preparation was initially contracted with (  )phenylephrine (0.3 am) to test its contractile capacity,
followed by addition of acetylcholine (10 am) to test the
lack of functional endothelium. then drugs were washed out
10 times with krebs solution. this protocol was carried out
two times and baseline tone was readjusted to 10 mn when
necessary.
after equilibration of smooth muscle preparations for 30
min, each preparation was initially contracted with (  )phenylephrine (0.3 am). a sustained plateau phase was
observed approximately 30 min after the addition of (  )-

phenylephrine. then the concentration – response relationship (0– 10 am) for the relaxation induced by (  )- xxxd2398xxx  was established twice. drugs were washed out, and 30
min later, preparations were contracted again with (  )phenylephrine (0.3 am), and each of the h-adrenoceptor
agonists ((  )- xxxd2398xxx  and ( f )-cgp12177a) was cumulatively added to the bath medium in half-log increments
until a maximum relaxant response was obtained. then
preparations were washed with ringer solution 10 times.
after the preparations were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min,
the protocol for the next concentration –response curve was
started.
2.6. assessment of the effects of b-adrenoceptor antagonists on relaxation in response to ()- xxxd2398xxx  and
(f)-cgp12177a
to assess the contribution of h-adrenoceptor subtypes
involved in the relaxant response to (  )- xxxd2398xxx  and
( f )-cgp12177a, the preparation was incubated for 60
min (30 min before and 30 min during stabilization of the
contractile response induced by (  )-phenylephrine) with
the following h-adrenoceptor antagonists either alone or in
combination: cgp20712a (a selective h1-adrenoceptor
antagonist), ici-118,551 (a selective h2-adrenoceptor antagonist), ( f )-propranolol (a nonselective h1- and h2-adrenoceptor antagonist) and ( f )- xxxd384xxx  (a nonselective h1-,
h2- and h3-adrenoceptor antagonist).
2.7. drugs
the following drugs were used in the present study:
(  )- xxxd2398xxx  hydrochloride, (  )-phenylephrine hydrochloride, ( f )-propranolol hydrochloride, indomethacin, l- xxxd228xxx  (sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo,
usa); cgp20712a (( f )-2-hydroxy-5-[2-[[2-hydroxy-3[4-[1-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1h-imidazol-2-yl]phenoxy]propyl]amino]ethoxy]-benzamide methanesulfonate),
ici-118,5511 (( f )-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1h-inden-4yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol hydrochloride),
( f )-cgp12177a (( f )-[4-[3-[(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]2-hydroxypropoxy]-1,3-dihydro-2h-benzimidazol-2-one]
hydrochloride) (research biochemicals international,
natick, ma, usa),  xxxd2914xxx  (novartis,
basel, switzerland), acetylcholine chloride (daiichi pharmaceutical, tokyo, japan) and ( f )- xxxd384xxx  (kaken pharmaceutical, tokyo, japan). the other
chemicals used were of analytical grade. cgp20712a
was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide to form a stock solution of 20 mm, and further diluted in distilled water.
indomethacin was dissolved in 2% na2co3 to form a
stock solution of 20 mm, and further diluted in distilled
water. final dimethylsulfoxide and na2co3 concentrations
in the bath solution did not affect muscle responses (data
not shown). all other drugs were dissolved in distilled
water.

2.8. data analysis
the results are expressed as means f s.e.m. or mean
values with 95% confidence intervals (cl) and n refers to
the number of experiments. the contractile potency of
(  )-phenylephrine and the relaxant potency of h-adrenoceptor agonists ((  )- xxxd2398xxx  and ( f )-cgp12177a)
are expressed as pec50 values (negative logarithm of the
effective drug concentration that produces a 50% response
of the maximum response). the relaxant effect (relaxation
(%) in figures and emax in tables) of each drug was
calculated with respect to basal tension (100% relaxation)
and steady-state contraction in response to contractile
drugs (0% relaxation). the antagonistic potency of  xxxd2914xxx , ( f )-propranolol and ( f )- xxxd384xxx  is expressed as a pa2 value. it was calculated according to
the method of arunlakshana and schild (1959).
data were plotted as a function of drug concentration and
fitted to the equation:
e ¼ emax  anh =ðecn50h þ anh þ
where e is % response at a given drug concentration, emax
is the maximum response, a is the concentration of drug,
nh is the slope function and ec50 is the effective drug
concentration that produces a 50% response. curve-fitting
was carried out using graphpad prismk (version 2.01,
graphpad software, san diego, ca, usa). the significance of the difference between mean values was evaluated with graphpad prismk by paired or unpaired t test,
or with unpaired t test with welch’s correction when
necessary. one-way analysis of variance (anova) followed by tukey’s multiple comparison test was also used.
a p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

3. results
3.1. assessment of the effect of ()-phenylephrine
(  )-phenylephrine, an a1-adrenoceptor agonist, is often used as a vasoconstrictor drug in order to observe hadrenoceptor-mediated relaxation clearly. in the first place,
the effect of (  )-phenylephrine was determined to confirm its contractile action in abdominal aorta smooth
muscle of rat. as shown in fig. 1, (  )-phenylephrine
induced a concentration-dependent contraction in spiral
preparations of rat abdominal aorta, with a pec50 of
8.51 f 0.03 (n = 3). the contractile response to (  )-phenylephrine was antagonized by  xxxd2914xxx  (0.01 – 0.1
am, a nonselective a-adrenoceptor antagonist) in a concentration-dependent manner. schild plot analysis for
 xxxd2914xxx  against the contraction in response to (  )phenylephrine gave a pa2 value of 8.20 (95% cl: 8.06–

8.35, n = 3), and the schild plot slope of 1.06 (95% cl:
0.86 – 1.26, n = 3) was not significantly different from
unity. these data indicate that (  )-phenylephrine activates mainly, if not exclusively, a-adrenoceptors in rat
abdominal aorta, and can be used to induce reproducible
contractions.
3.2. relaxant response to ()- xxxd2398xxx  and (f)cgp12177a in rat abdominal aorta
fig. 2a illustrates a typical trace of the relaxant response
to (  )- xxxd2398xxx  in rat abdominal aorta spiral preparations precontracted by the stimulation of a1-adrenoceptors
with (  )-phenylephrine (0.3 am). (  )- xxxd2398xxx  produced a concentration-dependent relaxation with a pec50
value of 7.26 f 0.07 (n = 16) and a maximum relaxation
induced by 10 am of 101.2 f 1.0% (n = 16) (table 1).
as shown in fig. 2b, ( f )-cgp12177a, a nonconventional partial h3-adrenoceptor agonist, also produced a concentration-dependent relaxation with a pec50 value of
5.14 f 0.06 (n = 18) and a maximum relaxation induced by
300 am of 101.8 f 1.1% (n = 18) (table 1).
3.3. resistance to desensitization of b3-adrenoceptors by
(f)-cgp12177a
it was noted that desensitization of h3-adrenoceptors was
observed with cgp12177a and brl37344 (a selective h3adrenoceptor agonist) in cardiac tissues (kaumann, 1996)
and gastrointestinal smooth muscles (oriowo, 1995), respec-

in drug concentration were added.

tively, when concentration– response curves were repeated
in the same tissues (see summers et al., 1997, for desensitization mechanisms). in order to clarify whether ( f )cgp12177a evokes desensitization of h3-adrenoceptors
after its repeated application to rat abdominal aorta smooth
muscle pretreated with a combination of cgp20712a and
ici-118,551 (0.1 am for each), further successive cumulative concentration– response curves were established after

the control concentration– response curve was determined.
the differences in the pec50 value and the maximum
relaxant response between control (1st application) and
2nd application were not significant ( p>0.05), while a slight
reduction in sensitivity was observed for the 3rd and 4th
concentration –response curves ( p < 0.05) (fig. 3, table 2).
hence, two concentration – response curves for ( f )cgp12177a per tissue were measured in the following
studies.
3.4. effects of (f)-propranolol, a nonselective b1- and b2adrenoceptor antagonist, on vasorelaxation elicited by () xxxd2398xxx  and (f)-cgp12177a
( f )-propranolol (0.01 – 0.1 am), a nonselective h1- and
h2-adrenoceptor antagonist, competitively antagonized the
relaxant response to (  )- xxxd2398xxx  (fig. 4a). the
schild plot analysis revealed the pa2 value for ( f )propranolol against (  )- xxxd2398xxx  to be 8.58 (95%
cl: 8.42 – 8.80, n = 7). the slope of 0.99 (95% cl:
0.83 –1.15, n = 7) was not significantly different from unity.
however, further addition of ( f )-propranolol in a concentration ranging from 0.3 to 3 am produced little or no further
shift of the concentration –response curve for (  )- xxxd2398xxx  (fig. 4a).
the relaxant response to ( f )-cgp12177a was unaffected by a high concentration of ( f )-propranolol (1 am)
( p>0.05) (fig. 4b). the pec50 value and the maximum

cgp20712a (a selective h1-adrenoceptor antagonist)
and ici-118,551 (a selective h2-adrenoceptor antagonist)
were used to clarify the h-adrenoceptor subtypes involved
in ( f )-propranolol-sensitive relaxation in response to (  ) xxxd2398xxx  in rat abdominal aorta smooth muscle. these
antagonists at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 0.3 am
produced small or no concentration-dependent rightward
shifts of the concentration – response curve for (  )- xxxd2398xxx  (fig. 5a,b). schild plot analyses for these data
yielded regression lines with slopes of 0.08 (95% cl:
 0.03 –0.20, n = 6) for cgp20712a and 0.53 (95% cl:
0.40 – 0.67, n = 6) for ici – 118,551, respectively (fig.
5a,b), and all slopes were significantly different from
unity.
pretreatment with a combination of cgp20712a and
ici-118,551 (0.1 am for each) produced a rightward shift of
14-fold in the concentration – response curve for (  )- xxxd2398xxx  with a slight reduction in the maximum response
(table 1). in contrast, the relaxant response to ( f )cgp12177a was unaffected by a combination of
cgp20712a and ici-118,551 (0.1 am for each) (table
2). the pec50 value and maximum relaxation (emax) are
summarized in tables 1 and 2.

4. discussion
the relaxation of vascular smooth muscles in response to
the stimulation of h-adrenoceptors with (  )- xxxd2398xxx  is
known to be mediated mainly through h2-adrenoceptors. in
the present study, the vasorelaxation induced by (  )- xxxd2398xxx  (a nonselective h-adrenoceptor agonist) or ( f )cgp12177a (a nonconventional partial h3-adrenoceptor
agonist) was examined by using several types of h-adrenoceptor antagonists in order to determine the contributions of
different subtypes to the relaxation of rat abdominal aorta
endothelium-denuded preparation.
4.1. characterization of smooth muscle relaxation induced
by ()- xxxd2398xxx  and (f)-cgp12177a in rat abdominal
aorta
(  )- xxxd2398xxx  induced concentration-dependent relaxation of rat abdominal aorta smooth muscle precontracted
by the activation of a1-adrenoceptors with (  )-phenylephrine (0.3 am). the relaxant response to (  )- xxxd2398xxx 
was competitively antagonized by ( f )-propranolol (0.01 –
0.1 am), a nonselective h1- and h2-adrenoceptor antagonist.
the estimated pa2 value of 8.58 (95% cl: 8.42 – 8.80) for
( f )-propranolol is in good agreement with the affinity
values (as pa2 or pki values) reported earlier, 8.6 at h1-

adrenoceptors and 8.3 at h2-adrenoceptors (arch and kaumann, 1993). these findings suggest that h1- and/or h2adrenoceptors are involved in ( f )-propranolol-sensitive
relaxation to (  )- xxxd2398xxx  in rat abdominal aorta smooth
muscle. a further increase in the concentration of ( f )propranolol (0.3 – 3 am) evoked little or no further antagonism of responses, suggesting the possible contribution of
other h-adrenoceptor subtypes (( f )-propranolol-insensitive
h-adrenoceptors) except h1- and/or h2-adrenoceptors, e.g.,
h3-adrenoceptors, in the relaxation in response to (  ) xxxd2398xxx  of rat abdominal aorta.
( f )-cgp12177a acts as a h3-adrenoceptor agonist with
potent h1- and h2-adrenoceptor antagonistic activities (arch
and kaumann, 1993; horinouchi and koike, 2001a). in rat
abdominal aorta smooth muscle, ( f )-cgp12177a also
produced potent vasorelaxation of (  )-phenylephrine-precontracted preparations, but the relaxant response was unaffected by the pretreatment with ( f )-propranolol (1 am).
the failure to inhibit the h1- and h2-adrenoceptor antagonistic effects with ( f )-propranolol indicates that h1- and h2adrenoceptors are not involved in ( f )-cgp12177a-induced relaxation in this preparation. moreover, the results
strongly support the functional presence of h3-adrenoceptors
in rat abdominal aorta smooth muscle.
such ( f )-propranolol-sensitive and -insensitive smooth
muscle relaxation was also observed in endothelium-intact
ring preparations of rat thoracic aorta (brawley et al.,
2000b). functional studies of rat thoracic aorta have shown
that ( f )-propranolol-sensitive (h1- and/or h2-) h-adrenoceptors are predominately present in endothelium compared
with smooth muscle (brawley et al., 2000b), and vascular
smooth muscle relaxation induced by the activation of

242

m. matsushita et al. / european journal of pharmacology 482 (2003) 235–244

endothelial h-adrenoceptors is mediated via  xxxd2738xxx 
release (brawley et al., 2000b; gray and marshall, 1992).
(  )- xxxd2398xxx  and ( f )-cgp12177a produced relaxation by stimulating mainly ( f )-propranolol-insensitive
(non h1-, h2-) atypical h-adrenoceptors in endotheliumdenuded preparations of rat thoracic aorta (brawley et al.,
2000b). hence, it is possible that, in contrast to rat abdominal aorta in the present study, ( f )-propranolol-sensitive hadrenoceptors are rarely present in smooth muscle of rat
thoracic aorta.
4.2. (f)-propranolol-sensitive vasorelaxation in response
to ()- xxxd2398xxx  in rat abdominal aorta smooth muscle
the results described above provided functional evidence
that the vasorelaxation in response to (  )- xxxd2398xxx  was
elicited due to the activation of ( f )-propranolol-sensitive hadrenoceptors and h3-adrenoceptors (( f )-propranolol-insensitive) in rat abdominal aorta. in addition, simple competitive antagonism of (  )- xxxd2398xxx  by ( f )-propranolol
suggests the predictable involvement of h1- and/or h2-adrenoceptors in the ( f )-propranolol-sensitive relaxant response
to (  )- xxxd2398xxx . therefore, detailed studies with highly
selective h1- and h2-adrenoceptor antagonists were performed to characterize the ( f )-propranolol-sensitive component. cgp20712a (dooley et al., 1986) and ici-118,551
(bilski et al., 1983) were used as tools to selectively block
h1- and h2-adrenoceptors, respectively. their affinity values
(as pa2 or pki values) at h1-, h2- and h3-adrenoceptors are
as follows: 8.5 – 9.3 (h1-subtype), 5.4 (h2-subtype) and
< 5.5 (h3-subtype) for cgp20712a, and 7.2 (h1-subtype),
8.3 – 9.2 (h2-subtype) and < 5.5 (h3-subtype) for ici118,551 (alexander et al., 2001; arch and kaumann,
1993; kaumann and molenaar, 1996). in rat abdominal
aorta smooth muscle, cgp20712a and ici-118,551 at
concentrations (0.01 –0.3 am) enough to block h1- and
h2-adrenoceptors, respectively, failed to cause concentration-dependent rightward shifts of concentration– response
curves for (  )- xxxd2398xxx . the schild slopes of regression lines in fig. 5a and b were significantly less than
unity. according to the theory of arunlakshana and schild
(1959), the schild equation predicts a linear regression line
with a slope of unity when a simple competitive antagonist
binds to a homogeneous population of receptors. in terms of
this theory, the present results obtained for rat abdominal
aorta smooth muscles suggest that neither h1- nor h2adrenoceptors are involved in the vasorelaxation in response to (  )- xxxd2398xxx . however, two possible
explanations for this phenomenon are as follows: (i)
mixed relaxations mediated by both h1- and h2-adrenoceptors were apparently antagonized by ( f )-propranolol
in a concentration-dependent manner, and (ii) a new type
of ( f )-propranolol-sensitive h-adrenoceptor differing
pharmacologically from conventional h1-, h2- and h3adrenoceptors may exist in rat abdominal aorta smooth
muscles.

4.3. functional dissimilarity between vascular b3-adrenoceptors and gastrointestinal b3-adrenoceptors
cross-desensitization is a general phenomenon in several tissues pretreated with either cgp12177a or a selective b3-adrenoceptor agonist, brl37344 (kaumann, 1996;
oriowo, 1995). for example, pretreatment of rat distal
colon with brl37344 (100 lm) for 30 min led to
approximately 400-fold inhibition of  xxxd2398xxx -induced
relaxation without a decrease in the maximum response
(oriowo, 1995). in the present study, however, b3-adrenoceptors in rat abdominal aorta smooth muscle were resistant to desensitization by prolonged exposure to (  ) xxxd2398xxx  and ( f )-cgp12177a, since both the potency
and the maximum relaxation induced by the three agonists
were unaltered when cumulative addition over 30 min was
repeated twice in the same tissues. thus, b3-adrenoceptors
of vascular smooth muscles mediating relaxation elicited
by (  )- xxxd2398xxx  and ( f )-cgp12177a are not identical to the well-characterized b3-adrenoceptors of gastrointestinal smooth muscles. these results would suggest that
the relative rate of desensitization of b3-adrenoceptors
induced by b-adrenoceptor agonists is essentially different
between vascular and non-vascular smooth muscles.
4.4. functional evidence for the presence of b3-adrenoceptors in rat abdominal aorta smooth muscle
thus, b3-adrenoceptors are thought to be involved in the
vasorelaxation in response to (  )- xxxd2398xxx  and ( f )cgp12177a. however, there is also a possibility that the
relaxation in response to b3-adrenoceptor agonists or nonconventional partial agonists is due to nonspecific blockade
of a1-adrenoceptors or interference with their signaling
pathway (brahmadevara et al., 2003). therefore, it is necessary to clarify the site of action of (  )- xxxd2398xxx  and
( f )-cgp12177a in the relaxation induced in the rat abdominal aorta.
to determine b3-adrenoceptor-mediated responses, both
the (  )-isomer and the racemate of  xxxd384xxx  have frequently been used in cardiovascular tissues (kaumann, 1996)
and gastrointestinal smooth muscles (horinouchi and koike,
1999a,b, 2000; koike and takayanagi, 1998).  xxxd384xxx  at
nanomolar concentrations blocks b1- and b2-adrenoceptors
with high affinity (arch and kaumann, 1993), and high
concentrations (lm order) of  xxxd384xxx  also have sufficient
affinity for atypical b-adrenoceptors associated with blockade of the pharmacological response to ( f )-cgp12177a:
e.g., b3-adrenoceptors in guinea-pig gastrointestinal smooth
muscles (horinouchi and koike, 1999a,b, 2000) and atypical
b-adrenoceptors in rat thoracic aorta (brawley et al.,
2000a,b). in rat abdominal aorta pretreated with cgp20712a
and ici-118,551 (0.1 lm for each) in combination, the
vasorelaxation in response to (  )- xxxd2398xxx  and ( f )cgp12177a was antagonized by ( f )- xxxd384xxx  (3 and 10
lm) in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating the

m. matsushita et al. / european journal of pharmacology 482 (2003) 235–244

possible contribution of b3-adrenoceptors to the relaxation.
estimated pa2 values of 6.10 ((  )- xxxd2398xxx ) and 5.78
(( f )-cgp12177a) for ( f )- xxxd384xxx  in the present study
are comparable to those reported earlier: 6.02 –6.08 against
(  )- xxxd2398xxx  and 5.70 –5.80 against ( f )-cgp12177a
in h3-adrenoceptors of guinea-pig gastrointestinal smooth
muscles (horinouchi and koike, 1999a,b, 2000). furthermore, the slopes of schild plots were not different from unity.
thus, the present observation clearly suggests that, in the
presence of h1- and h2-adrenoceptor antagonists, relaxant
responses to (  )- xxxd2398xxx  and ( f )-cgp12177a in rat
abdominal aorta smooth muscle are mediated by h3-adrenoceptors and not by nonspecific blockade of a1-adrenoceptors.
in rat thoracic aorta, the (  )-isomer of  xxxd384xxx 
inhibited the relaxation in response to (  )- xxxd2398xxx  in
a different manner (brawley et al., 2000a). (  )- xxxd384xxx 
(5– 30 am) shifted the concentration– response curve for
(  )- xxxd2398xxx  and reduced the maximum response induced by 100 am in rat thoracic aorta treated with ( f )propranolol (0.3 am) (brawley et al., 2000a). moreover,
apparent pa2 values of 5.0– 5.2 for (  )- xxxd384xxx  (the pa2
values can be converted to ‘‘4.7 –4.9’’ for ( f )- xxxd384xxx )
in rat thoracic aorta (brawley et al., 2000a) were smaller
than pa2 values for ( f )- xxxd384xxx  obtained in rat abdominal aorta (6.10 against (  )- xxxd2398xxx ; 5.78 against ( f )cgp12177a; in the present study). the different antagonism exerted by  xxxd384xxx  in thoracic and abdominal aorta
in rat suggests the possibility that each h3-adrenoceptor
(atypical h-adrenoceptors) is essentially heterogeneous.
4.5. conclusion
in summary, the present study with ( f )- xxxd384xxx  as
competitive antagonist provided functional evidence that the
relaxation of rat abdominal aorta in response to (  )- xxxd2398xxx  and ( f )-cgp12177a is mediated through the
activation of h3-adrenoceptors.
