genetic defects of the naⴙ-kⴙ-2clⴚ ( xxxg2078xxx ) sodium  xxxd2988xxx  co-transporter result in severe, prenatal-onset renal
salt wasting accompanied by polyhydramnios, prematurity, and life-threatening hypovolemia of the neonate (antenatal bartter
syndrome or hyperprostaglandin e syndrome). herein are described two brothers who presented with hyperuricemia, mild
metabolic alkalosis, low serum potassium levels, and bilateral medullary nephrocalcinosis at the ages of 13 and 15 yr. impaired
function of  xxxd3213xxx  reabsorption along the thick ascending limb of henle’s loop was deduced from a reduced increase
in diuresis and urinary chloride excretion upon application of furosemide. molecular genetic analysis revealed that the
brothers were compound heterozygotes for mutations in the  xxxg2078xxx  gene coding for the  xxxg2078xxx  co-transporter. functional
analysis of the mutated rat  xxxg2078xxx  protein by tracer-flux assays after heterologous expression in xenopus oocytes revealed
significant residual transport activity of the  xxxg2078xxx  p.f177y mutant construct in contrast to no activity of the  xxxg2078xxx -d918fs
frameshift mutant construct. however, coexpression of the two mutants was not significantly different from that of nkcc2f177y alone or wild type. membrane expression of  xxxg2078xxx -f177y as determined by luminometric surface quantification was
not significantly different from wild-type protein, pointing to an intrinsic partial transport defect caused by the p.f177y
mutation. the partial function of  xxxg2078xxx -f177y, which is not negatively affected by  xxxg2078xxx -d918fs, therefore explains a mild
and late-onset phenotype and for the first time establishes a mild phenotype-associated  xxxg2078xxx  gene mutation.

he central role of the kidney in maintaining body salt
and water homeostasis depends on the integrity of a
series of transepithelial transport processes that are
located throughout the nephron. vectorial transepithelial salt
reabsorption along the loop of henle is crucial for the generation of a high interstitial osmolality, which draws back water
from the tubular fluid that passes the medullary collecting
ducts. the key player in the process of interstitial salt accumulation is the na⫹-k⫹-2cl⫺ co-transporter ( xxxg2078xxx ), which catalyzes the apical entry step of  xxxd3213xxx  from the lumen
into epithelial cells of the thick ascending limb (tal). potassium shunts back into the tubular fluid via apical renal outer
medullary potassium channels ( xxxg1249xxx ), whereas sodium and
chloride are extruded basolaterally into the medullary interstitium via sodium/potassium atpases and clc-k–type chloride
channels, respectively. in concerted action, these transport processes not only accumulate  xxxd3213xxx  in the medullary

interstitium but also confer positive electrical charge to the
luminal side of the tal epithelium. along the tal, this transepithelial voltage gradient forces out divalent cations from the
lumen via calcium- and magnesium-selective paracellular pathways. the prominent importance of the  xxxg2078xxx  co-transporter
in this machinery is evidenced by the effects of loop diuretics,
which, as pharmacologic  xxxg2078xxx  inhibitors, are the most potent agents available to increase urinary water, salt, and calcium excretion. even more impressive, genetic mutations of the
 xxxg2078xxx  encoding gene  xxxg2078xxx  are associated with antenatal
bartter syndrome (hyperprostaglandin e syndrome [abs/
hps]) (1). prenatal-onset renal salt and water wasting in this
autosomal recessive disorder leads to polyhydramnios entailing extreme prematurity. after birth, life-threatening volume
depletion, hypokalemia, and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis come along with hypercalciuria and medullary nephrocalcinosis. without appropriate treatment, patients with abs/hps
will not survive the early neonatal period (2). in congruence
with the severity of the symptoms and the uniformity of the
clinical picture, functional analysis of diverse  xxxg2078xxx  mutants
consistently revealed a complete loss-of-function effect of the
tested mutations (3).
here we describe the case of two siblings who presented with
hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, and medullary nephrocalcinosis

at the ages of 13 and 15 yr. molecular genetic analyses revealed
that the brothers were compound heterozygotes for mutations
in the  xxxg2078xxx  gene. because one of the mutations only partially impaired  xxxg2078xxx  function, variable degrees of  xxxg2078xxx 
dysfunction may be associated with variations of the clinical
picture. this is the first report of patients with a mild and
late-onset phenotype associated with  xxxg2078xxx  gene defects
and indicates that partially impaired  xxxg2078xxx  function should
be considered even beyond the neonatal period in patients who
present with symptoms of renal salt wasting.

materials and methods
in vivo assessment of tal function
diuresis and urinary chloride excretion in response to oral furosemide application (2 mg/kg body wt) was determined essentially as
described by koeckerling et al. (4). in brief, urine volume and urinary
chloride excretion during 3 h were determined at the same time on 2
consecutive days under standard diet and fluid intake. the first day
served as the control period. on the second day, urine collection during
3 h was performed immediately after a single oral dose of furosemide.
the difference in urine volume and chloride excretion between day 1
and day 2 (⌬v, ⌬cl) was considered to be induced by furosemide
administration. a possible bias by variable furosemide concentrations
was excluded by normalization of ⌬v and ⌬cl to urinary furosemide
excretion.

 xxxg2078xxx  sequence analysis
informed consent was obtained from the patients and their parents
before blood samples were taken for genomic dna isolation. all 26
exons together with adjacent intronic sequences of the  xxxg2078xxx  gene
(1) were pcr amplified from genomic dna according to standard
protocols. pcr products with aberrant electrophoretic mobility determined by single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis were
sequenced in both directions. all nucleotide variations observed were
confirmed from independent pcr and dna samples from 50 healthy,
unrelated white individuals and served as normal controls.

cloning of the  xxxg2078xxx  gene from rat kidney
freshly prepared rat kidney tissue was homogenized in cold trizol
reagent (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca; www.invitrogen.com), and total
rna was prepared according the manufacturer’s recommendations.
after mrna purification with oligo-dt– coupled beads (oligotex
mrna purification system; qiagen, valencia, ca; www.qiagen.com),
reverse transcription to cdna was performed with superscript reverse
transcriptase (invitrogen). we used a proofreading polymerase (pfupolymerase; stratagene, la jolla, ca; www.stratagene.com) to amplify
the complete open reading frame of the  xxxg2078xxx  cdna (ncbi genbank
accesion no. xm_579419) with the primers (in 5⬘-3⬘ direction) tgg
aag atg tca gtc aac atc cct tcc(5⬘-end) and tc cct cgc
gct tta aga gta aaa tgt c (3⬘-end; the start atg and the
reverse complementary stop tta are indicated in bold). the resulting
pcr product was cloned into pcrii-topo (invitrogen) and sequenced
in both directions. to optimize translation efficacy in xenopus oocytes,
we then transferred the verified cdna sequence to pogii, which
contains the 5⬘- and 3⬘- untranslated regions of the xenopus ␤-globin
gene. site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the quickchange protocol (quickchange site directed mutagenesis kit; stratagene).

expression in xenopus laevis oocytes and tracer flux
measurements
ten or 20 ng of in vitro transcribed rat crna (mmessage mmachine
kit; ambion, austin, tx; www.ambion.com) for the  xxxg2078xxx  constructs
were injected in defolliculated xenopus oocytes, which were kept at
16°c in nd96 storage solution that contained 96.0 mmol/l nacl, 2.0
mmol/l kcl, 1.8 mmol/l cacl2, 1.0 mmol/l mgcl2, 5.0 mmol/l
hepes (ph 7.4), 2.5 mmol/l sodium pyruvate, 0.5 mmol/l theophylline, and 20 ␮g/ml gentamicin. four days after injection, 36cl uptake
was determined in chloride-free nd96 uptake solution (which contained [in mmol/l] 96.0 na-aspartate, 80.0  xxxd2540xxx , 2.0 koh, 1.8
ca-acetate, 1.0 mg-acetate, and 5.0 hepes [ph 7.4]) supplemented with
5.0 mmol/l na36cl. after equilibration for 15 min in 36cl-free uptake
solution, the tracer was added and cells were kept in uptake solution at
room temperature for 60 min, then cooled on ice and washed five times
in ice-cold chloride-free nd96 (without tracer). after mechanical lysis,
intracellular radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting for
each oocyte. mean and sem of the determined counts per minute (cpm)
are shown for at least 15 oocytes per data point from the same preparation. experiments were repeated in at least three different batches of
oocytes that were derived from different frogs. the error bars in the
diagrams were calculated from the sem. statistical significance was
analyzed with t test (unpaired test with unequal variance) and was
assumed at a p ⱕ 0.05.

quantification of  xxxg2078xxx  surface expression
for quantification of wild-type and mutated  xxxg2078xxx  surface expression, a hemagglutinin (ha) epitope was inserted into the extracellular
loop between the transmembrane domains vii and viii (as predicted
by hydropathy analysis). as determined by tracer-flux experiments, the
extracellular ha epitope did not interfere with 36cl uptake activity
(data not shown). surface quantification of  xxxg2078xxx -ha constructs after
expression in xenopus oocytes was performed as described previously
(5). in brief, viable  xxxg2078xxx -ha– expressing oocytes were labeled with
rat anti-ha mab (3f10, 1 ␮g/ml). after rigorous washing in cold nd96
solution, bound antibodies on individual oocytes were detected with
horseradish peroxidase– coupled goat anti-rat antibodies (fab fragments, 1:500 dilution; jackson immunoresearch, west grove, pa) in a
peroxidase-catalyzed luminescence reaction using supersignal elisa
femto maximum sensitivity chemiluminescent substrate (pierce, rockford, il). the luminescence signal as determined by a luminometer
(berthold lumat lb9507; berthold technologies, bad wildbad, germany) is given in relative light units. oocytes that expressed wild-type
 xxxg2078xxx  without ha epitope served as control. the experiments were
repeated in three different batches of oocytes that were derived from
different frogs. for each data point, approximately 20 oocytes that were
derived from one single preparation were analyzed individually, and
the relative light units are given as mean ⫾ sem.

normal, as was plasma creatinine. a more elaborate workup
that was initiated by these findings showed elevated serum
renin (50.5 pg/ml) and aldosterone levels (865 pg/ml). urinalysis after 24-h urine collection revealed mild polyuria (2850
ml/24 h or approximately 30 ml/kg per 24 h) with a urine
osmolality of 248 mosmol/kg. fractional sodium excretion was
increased (4.7%). moreover, mild hypercalciuria with 107
␮mol/kg body wt per 24 h calcium excreted and decreased uric
acid clearance (2.7 ml/min) were noted. urinary excretion of
 xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) was normal (19.4 ng/h per 1.73 m2
body surface area); that of prostaglandin em (pge-m) was
slightly increased (644 ng/h per 1.73 m2). sonographic evaluation of the kidneys revealed bilateral medullary nephrocalcinosis. therapy was started with an oral potassium supplementation (1 mmol/kg body wt) and allopurinol (3.5 mg/kg body
wt).
patient 2, the younger brother of patient 1, was born at term
after an uncomplicated pregnancy. he thrived well until the
age of 5 yr, when for the first time a reduced growth rate was
noted. a diagnostic evaluation because of overt growth delay
(height ⫺2.1 sd score; weight ⫺2.3 sd score) was performed at
the age of 13 yr and revealed hypokalemia (3.2 mmol/l) with
normal values for plasma sodium, calcium, and magnesium.
compensated metabolic alkalosis with base excesses ranging
from 5.1 to 7.7 mmol/l was observed on several occasions in
follow-up examinations. creatinine was normal, renin was elevated, and aldosterone levels peaked at 232 pg/ml in follow-up examinations. plasma  xxxd3472xxx  was increased, and uric
acid clearance was decreased. in several follow-up examinations, the fractional urine excretion of sodium varied between
1.52 and 4.41%, and 24-h urinary calcium excretion varied
between 64 and 194 ␮mol/kg. urine osmolality varied between
245 and 284 mosmol/kg with 24-h urine amounts ranging
between 1050 and 4000 ml (approximately 20 to 80 ml/kg per

24 h). urinary excretion of pge2 was normal, as was that of
pge-m. sonography of the kidneys showed bilateral medullary
nephrocalcinosis. oral  xxxd2988xxx  (0.6 mmol/kg body
wt) and allopurinol (7.5 mg/kg body wt) were started.
in both siblings, the constellation of hypokalemia, (compensated) metabolic alkalosis, mild polyuria, increased fractional
sodium excretion, and hypercalciuria with nephrocalcinosis
pointed to a  xxxd3213xxx  transport defect along the tal of
henle’s loop. to evaluate the function of the tal in vivo, we
applied the nkcc inhibitor furosemide to both patients and
the effects on diuresis and urinary chloride excretion were
determined. in case of impaired tal  xxxd3213xxx  reabsorption, addition of the loop diuretic furosemide should exert
no or only minor effects on diuresis and renal chloride excretion. when compared with healthy control subjects and patients with typical clinical features of abs/hps (4), the stimulatory effect of furosemide on diuresis and urinary chloride
excretion for both siblings was between the means of both
groups (figure 1). a partially impaired capacity for sodium
chloride reabsorption along the tal therefore could explain
the electrolyte disturbances of both patients.
the  xxxg2078xxx  isoform of the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporters is the pacemaker of tal  xxxd3213xxx  reabsorption. we therefore analyzed the sequence of the  xxxg2078xxx 
encoding gene  xxxg2078xxx  in both patients. as shown in figure 2,
mutations were detected in both  xxxg2078xxx  alleles of both patients: a missense mutation (c.530 t⬎a) resulting in an phenylalanine to tyrosine exchange at amino acid position 177
(p.f177y) was inherited from the father, and a frameshift mutation (c.2751dupt) that results in a frameshift with premature
stop codon at amino acid position 918, deleting a major part of
the intracellular c-terminus (p.d918fs), was inherited from the
mother. as expected, the parents were found to be heterozygous for only one mutation. these mutations were neither

from healthy individuals (data not shown).
genetic defects of the  xxxg2078xxx  transporter were the first to be
identified in abs/hps (1). up to now,  xxxg2078xxx  defects were
unambiguously associated with prenatal manifestation and severe, life-threatening volume depletion in the early neonatal
period (6). so far analyzed, complete loss of human  xxxg2078xxx 
transport activity was described for the  xxxg2078xxx  mutations
associated with the severe phenotype (3). the relatively mild
phenotype observed in these cases therefore might be explained by some residual activity of the affected  xxxg2078xxx  proteins. to clarify this point, we performed 36cl-uptake experiments after heterologous expression of wild-type rat  xxxg2078xxx 
and mutated proteins in xenopus oocytes. the rat ortholog of
 xxxg2078xxx , which shows 93% overall sequence identity with the
human isoform, was used for these experiments because it gave
more robust uptake signals. as shown in figures 3 and 4, top,
expression of wild-type rat  xxxg2078xxx  ( xxxg2078xxx -wt) resulted in
an approximately three-fold increase of 36cl uptake when compared with noninjected oocytes. as expected, expression of a
mutated  xxxg2078xxx  protein that was identified in a patient with a
prenatal onset abs/hps (p.l196p) did not induce chloride

the p.f177y and the p.d918fs mutations were identified in
both patients. both mutations affect highly conserved amino
acid residues (middle: amino acid alignment of human [homo
sapiens (hs)], rat [rattus norvegicus (rn)], spiny dogfish [squalus
acanthias (sa)], and fruit fly [drosophila melanogaster (dm)]
 xxxg2078xxx  sequences). the p.l196p mutation that was detected in
a patient with abs/hps served as a nonfunctional negative
control. the position of the hemagglutinin (ha) epitope inserted for  xxxg2078xxx  surface quantification is indicated between
transmembrane domains vii and viii close to two predicted
glycosylation sites (protein model according to reference [15]).

figure 3. functional analysis of the  xxxg2078xxx  mutations. xenopus
oocytes were injected with 10 ng of rat crna for the indicated
constructs and 36cl uptake subsequently was measured. noninjected oocytes and oocytes that expressed the p.l196p mutation that was identified in a patient with abs/hps served as
controls. in contrast to the p.d918fs frameshift mutation, the
p.f177y missense mutation induced a 36cl uptake that was
significantly different from noninjected oocytes. the columns
represent the mean ⫾ sem of at least 15 oocytes per injected
crna. a similar level of expression of wild-type and mutated
 xxxg2078xxx  proteins is demonstrated by western blot analysis of
ha-tagged constructs with a monoclonal anti-ha antibody.
note that the wild-type protein without ha epitope (wt) is not
recognized by the antibody and that the p.d918fs construct is
shifted to a lower molecular weight because of the deletion of
a part of the c-terminal sequence.

uptake significantly different from control oocytes. the same
was true for the construct with the p.d918fs mutation detected
in one  xxxg2078xxx  allele of the two brothers. in contrast, expression of the p.f177y mutation that was detected in the other
allele showed partial chloride uptake, which amounted to 50%
or more of the wild-type  xxxg2078xxx  uptake. therefore, the
p.f177y mutation in humans may result in a chloride-transporting protein with approximately half of the activity of the
wild-type protein.
functional  xxxg2078xxx  transporters recently were shown to consist of two  xxxg2078xxx  subunits (7). in view of the heterozygosity
for both mutations, as observed in our patients, this dimeric
architecture might implicate a negative impact of one mutated
transporter on the function of the other. to rule out such a
dominant negative effect of the p.d918fs mutation on the function of the construct with p.f177y, we performed coexpression
experiments with co-injection of both mutants as well as coinjection of each of the mutants plus the wild type. as shown in
figure 4, neither of the constructs with p.f177y or p.d918fs
impaired transport activity of  xxxg2078xxx  wild type. moreover, the
activity of the construct with p.f177y remained unchanged in
the presence of the p.d918fs mutant. these in vitro findings
argue against a dominant negative effect of the p.d918fs mutation. to support this notion in vivo, we determined the osmolality of a morning urine sample of the patients’ mother, who is

and mutated  xxxg2078xxx  rat crna (20 ␮g for each construct) were
injected alone or in combination as indicated.  xxxg2078xxx  constructs with an extracellular ha epitope were used for luminometric surface quantification after heterologous expression
in xenopus oocytes. oocytes that expressed  xxxg2078xxx  without
ha epitope ( xxxg2078xxx -wt) served as a negative control. in contrast to the construct with p.d918fs (p.d918fs-ha) and p.l196p
(p.l196p-ha identified in a patient with abs/hps) the construct with p.f177y (p.f177y-ha), which displayed residual
transport activity, showed a surface expression that was not
significantly different from the wild-type protein (nkcc2ha). coexpression of p.d918fs does not negatively affect transport activity or surface expression of  xxxg2078xxx  wild type or
p.f177y. the columns represent the mean ⫾ sem of at least 15

and argues against an inhibitory effect of the p.d918fs mutation
on  xxxg2078xxx  wild-type function.
impaired  xxxg2078xxx  transport activity in case of the p.f177y
mutation might result from (1) decreased protein stability, (2)
decreased expression in the plasma membrane via either impaired insertion in or increased clearance from the membrane,
or (3) disturbed function of an otherwise normally processed
protein. to reveal the underlying mechanism compromising
transport activity of the construct with the p.f177y mutation,
we compared surface expression of wild-type and mutated
proteins expressed in xenopus oocytes. to this end, we inserted
an ha epitope into an extracellular loop of the  xxxg2078xxx  proteins
( xxxg2078xxx -ha; the transport activity as determined by 36cl-

j am soc nephrol 17: 2136 –2142, 2006

uptake measurements was not affected by this protein modification; data not shown). quantification of ha expression on
viable oocytes via an enzyme-linked luminometric assay then
allowed determination of  xxxg2078xxx  surface expression. as
shown in figure 4, a strong ha-dependent luminescence signal
appeared after expression of wild-type  xxxg2078xxx -ha. no surface
expression was detected for the loss-of-function mutation
p.l196p detected in a patient with abs/hps. similarly, a severely reduced cell membrane expression was observed for the
construct with the p.d918fs (p.d918fs-ha). in contrast, a luminescence signal similar to that of the wild-type protein appeared after expression of the p.f177y mutation (p.f177y-ha).
the p.d918fs mutation therefore seemed to affect cell membrane insertion of  xxxg2078xxx , whereas the p.f177y mutation impaired directly the transport function of the  xxxg2078xxx  protein
without affecting protein stability or membrane insertion.
moreover, in co-injection experiments, neither p.f177y nor
p.d918fs affected the surface expression of the ha-tagged
wild-type protein ( xxxg2078xxx -ha ⫹ p.f177y and  xxxg2078xxx -ha ⫹
p.d918fs, respectively), and co-injection of both mutants
(p.f177y-ha ⫹ p.d918fs) showed no effect of the p.d918fs
mutant on surface expression of p.f177y-ha.

discussion
in this report, we describe an unusually mild phenotype that
resulted from a particular combination of mutations of the
 xxxg2078xxx  gene coding for the  xxxg2078xxx  sodium  xxxd2988xxx  co-transporter. the clinical picture with mild polyuria and
borderline hypercalciuria clearly contrasts with the prenatalonset disease with polyhydramnios, prematurity, and severe
neonatal volume depletion hitherto known to be associated
with  xxxg2078xxx  gene mutations (abs/hps). consistent with the
in vivo finding of residual furosemide-sensitive chloride transport along the tal, our functional results in vitro suggest
significant residual transport activity in humans of the p.f177y
mutated  xxxg2078xxx  protein, which may well account for the
clearly attenuated phenotype of both patients. their laboratory
findings perfectly mirror the side effects of nkcc inhibition by
chronic furosemide application (8): decreased urine-concentrating ability, increased fractional sodium excretion, and hypercalciuria. salt wasting and volume depletion in addition
lead to secondary hyperaldosteronism (resulting in hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis) and increase proximal tubular
urate reabsorption entailing hyperuricemia.
according to our functional data, only approximately half of
the normal  xxxg2078xxx  activity would be expected along the tal
of the described patients. although this extent of functional
 xxxg2078xxx  impairment plausibly reconciles with the mild clinical
picture and the reduced renal tubular sensitivity for furosemide, a one-to-one translation from our heterologous expression data to in vivo conditions might not necessarily be warranted. additional factors in tal cells, which might not be
relevant in the setting of heterologous overexpression of crna
in xenopus oocytes, might influence the activity of the mutated
proteins. despite these limitations of a heterologous expression
system using rat crna, our data suggest that the investigated
mutations affect different aspects of  xxxg2078xxx  protein function.

partial impairment of  xxxg2078xxx  co-transport activity

the p.d918fs mutation clearly interferes with membrane trafficking of the  xxxg2078xxx  protein, and a patient who is homozygous for this mutation is likely to present with severe abs/hps,
whereas the p.f177y mutation directly impairs transport function of  xxxg2078xxx , whose abundance in the cell membrane seems
not to be affected. one might speculate that homozygosity for
this mutation would result in an even milder phenotype as
observed for the described patients. unfortunately, comprehensive structure-function data (i.e., crystallization data) are not yet
on hand for this family of transport proteins. the available data
mainly are inferred indirectly from domain-swapping approaches between shark and mammalian nkcc and point to
the importance of the second, fourth, and seventh predicted
␣-helical domains for ion transport (9). therefore, we cannot
predict the role of the affected amino acid residue at the beginning of the first ␣-helical domain in the transport cycle of the
 xxxg2078xxx  protein. with respect to the results from our coexpression experiments and the normal urine-concentrating capability
of the mother, who is heterozygous for the p.d918fs mutation,
we can exclude, however, a dominant negative effect of this
mutation on  xxxg2078xxx  wild-type or p.f177y activity.
in line with the mild clinical presentation, urinary excretion
of pge2, which is increased heavily in the prenatal-onset disease (2), was close to normal in our patients. renal pge2
overproduction in abs/hps is thought to derive from impaired
entry of chloride into the macula densa cells of the distal tubule,
which in turn increases expression of  xxxg1884xxx , a key
enzyme of the prostanoid pathway (2,10,11). in contrast to
epithelial cells of the tal, which express the isoforms a and f
of  xxxg2078xxx , apical  xxxd3213xxx  entry in macula densa cells
is mediated by the isoform b. these isoforms result from alternative splicing of an exon encoding a 96-bp region of  xxxg2078xxx ,
giving rise to three different protein sequences in the second
transmembrane domain. because the p.f177y mutation affects
the beginning of the first transmembrane domain, it is expected
to occur in any of the described  xxxg2078xxx  splice variants. residual transport activity of the macula densa isoform b hence
might explain normal urinary pge2 excretion as observed in
our patients and thereby in addition would support the concept
of residual  xxxg2078xxx  transport activity.
despite this strong evidence for residual  xxxg2078xxx  function,
the renal concentrating capability of our patients, as deduced
from their urine osmolalities, surprisingly was not substantially
higher than that of patients with untreated abs/hps (2). an
impairment of the renal concentrating capability by the severe
medullary nephrocalcinosis in addition to the partial  xxxg2078xxx 
defect might explain this discrepancy. moreover, we cannot
completely rule out the possibility of another mutation within
unsequenced regions of the  xxxg2078xxx  gene, which might interfere with  xxxg2078xxx  expression or function in vivo.
although exceptional for  xxxg2078xxx  mutations, mild and lateonset clinical manifestation of bartter syndrome has been described for mutations that affect the clcnkb gene coding for
the clc-kb chloride channel (6,12,13). distinct differences in
disease severities hitherto hampered a direct comparison of
severe renal salt wasting as observed in abs/hps caused by
 xxxg2078xxx  malfunction with the milder bartter syndrome as a

result of impaired clc-kb function. whereas plasma electrolyte
abnormalities of patients who have clcnkb gene defects resemble those of the here described mild  xxxg2078xxx  defect, the
former normally show milder impairment in urine-concentrating capability and normal urinary calcium excretion so that
nephrocalcinosis usually does not develop (6). how could this
discrepancy be explained? clc-kb together with the ␤-subunit
barttin forms a basolateral chloride exit pathway not only in the
tal but also along the distal convoluted tubule (dct), where
luminal uptake of  xxxd3213xxx  is mediated via the thiazidesensitive  xxxd3213xxx  co-transporter  xxxg2080xxx  (2,14). in contrast to a  xxxg2078xxx  defect, which affects  xxxd3213xxx  reabsorption exclusively along the tal, a clc-kb defect thus
would impair salt reabsorption along the tal and the dct. in
contrast to the tal, disturbed  xxxd3213xxx  reabsorption
along the dct results in hypocalciuria. in case of a combined
impairment of tal and dct, this calcium-saving effect of
disturbed dct  xxxd3213xxx  reabsorption could counteract
the reduced calcium reabsorption along the tal, eventually
resulting in normo- or even hypocalciuria (12). as learned from
our two patients, the phenotypic differences observed in
 xxxg2078xxx  and clc-kb malfunction therefore may reflect not only
differences in disease severity but also the different nephron
segments affected by the mutations.

conclusion
we have shown that a particular combination of  xxxg2078xxx 
mutations is associated with variations in disease severity. an
incomplete loss-of-function effect of the described p.f177y mutation might explain the mild phenotype. reduced  xxxg2078xxx 
function therefore might be considered in patients who present
with hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hyperuricemia, and
nephrocalcinosis even beyond the neonatal period.
