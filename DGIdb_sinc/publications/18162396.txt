abstract—2-n,n-dimethylamino-1,3,4-thiadiazole-5-methanesulfonamide was tested for its interaction with the 12 catalytically
active mammalian carbonic anhydrase (ca,  xxxg40xxx   xxxg41xxx   xxxg671xxx   xxxg703xxx .1) isozymes, ca i–xiv. the compound is a potent inhibitor of ca iv,
vii, ix, xii, and xiii (kis of 0.61–39 nm), a medium potency inhibitor of ca ii and va (kis of 121–438 nm), and a weak inhibitor against the other isoforms (ca iii, vb, vi, and xiv), making it a very interesting candidate for situations in which a strong/
selective inhibition of certain isozymes is needed. the crystal structure of the hca ii adduct of this sulfonamide revealed interesting
interactions between the inhibitor and the enzyme which are quite diﬀerent from those observed in the adducts of ca ii with the
structurally related aliphatic derivatives  xxxd3564xxx , 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazolyl-5-diﬂuoromethanesulfonamide, and 2-dimethylamino-5-[sulfonamido-(aminomethyl)]-1,3,4-thiadiazole reported earlier.

carbonic anhydrases (cas,  xxxg40xxx   xxxg41xxx   xxxg671xxx   xxxg703xxx .1) are widespread
metalloenzymes in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes,
catalyzing a critically important physiologic reaction,
hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons.1–4 these enzymes are inhibited by several classes
of compounds, such as sulfonamides,1,5–9 sulfamates,1,2
and sulfamides,1,2 some of which have pharmacologic
applications for the treatment of glaucoma,5 obesity,6
cancer,8–12 epilepsy,7 and other neurological disorders,1,2 or as diuretics.5 bacterial, fungal, and protozoan

to be considered recently as potential targets for the
development of inhibitors with therapeutic applications.13–18 inhibitors belonging to the chemical classes
mentioned above bind to the catalytic zinc ion within
the enzyme cavity, as shown by means of x-ray crystallographic studies for many representatives, mainly in
complex with the ubiquitous human isoform ii (hca
ii).5a,19–24 a number of such derivatives are clinically
used drugs, such as acetazolamide,  xxxd2592xxx ,
 xxxd2058xxx ,  xxxd1872xxx ,  xxxd1931xxx ,  xxxd367xxx , topiramate,  xxxd3564xxx , sulpiride,  xxxd3262xxx ,
celecoxib, and  xxxd3481xxx  among others.1,25 other compounds are in clinical development, such as indisulam
and coumate-667.1
as mentioned above, ca inhibitors (cais) are mainly
used in therapy as diuretics and antiglaucoma agents
but some of them also show marked anticonvulsant,
antiobesity, and antitumor eﬀects.1,2,5–11 this is due to
the fact that such inhibitors target diﬀerent isozymes

among the 16 presently known in vertebrates.1,2 however, most of the presently available cais show undesired side eﬀects due to indiscriminate inhibition of ca
isoforms other than the target one.1,2,5–14 thus, many
new cai classes are being developed in the search of isozyme selective compounds as potential drugs with less
side eﬀects.1,5,25

cal 2(5)-substituted-1,3,4-thiadiazole ring present in
two of the classical cais, acetazolamide and  xxxd2592xxx . compounds 5–7 are representatives of this new
class of cais recently described in the literature, but
they were not assayed in detail for the inhibition of different ca isoforms.26 the x-ray crystal structure of the
adducts of hca ii with 6 and 7 was reported recently by
fisher et al., but no ca inhibitory data were available
for these two derivatives.24 compounds structurally
similar to 6 and 7 were however reported by boyle
et al.26 to act as good to moderate ca ii inhibitors
(kis in the range of 15–208 nm). on the other hand,
cecchi et al.27c investigated similar aliphatic sulfonamides possessing cf2so2nh2 and ch2so2nh2 zbgs
attached to benzene, coumarin or steroid scaﬀolds,
which showed selective inhibition of the mitochondrial
isoform ca va over the ubiquitous, cytosolic isozymes
ca i and ii or the transmembrane, tumor-associated
one ca ix. thus, this type of relatively little

the most investigated cais belong to the sulfonamide
class.1,2,24–27 aromatic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic such
derivatives were investigated, such as for example acetazolamide 1, its deacetylated precursor 2,  xxxd2592xxx 
3 and  xxxd3564xxx  4.1,2,24–27 compounds1, 3, and 4 have
clinical applications as diuretics, antiglaucoma, and
antiepileptic drugs.1,2,26,27 an interesting class of novel
cais was recently reported by blackburn’s group,24,26

compounds with diﬀerent and possibly improved selectivity/inhibition proﬁles, as well as enhanced solubility,
as compared to those of the classical, clinically used sulfonamide cais.

in this work, we report the ﬁrst detailed inhibition study
of all 12 catalytically active mammalian ca isoforms
with an aliphatic sulfonamide of this type, that is,
5,26,28 as well as a high resolution x-ray crystal structure
for its adduct with the ubiquitous and physiologically
relevant hca ii.
sulfonamide 5 has been investigated for the inhibition of
the 12 catalytically active mammalian ca isoforms ca
i–xiv (h, human; m, mouse isozyme) (table 1). data
for the structurally related, clinically used derivatives
1–4 are also included for comparison, as they are available in the literature.1,27,29 it may be observed that compound 5 acts as a potent inhibitor of isoforms ca iv,
vii, ix, xii, and xiii, with kis in the range of 0.61–
39 nm. on the other hand, 5 is a medium potency inhibitor of ca ii and va (kis of 121–438 nm), and a weak
inhibitor against the other isoforms (ca iii, vb, vi,
and xiv), with kis in the range of 1422–3.6 · 105 nm
(table 1). it is thus clear that the inhibition proﬁle of
5 is completely diﬀerent from those of the clinically used
sulfonamides 1, 3, and 4 or the acetazolamide precursor
2 with which 5 is structurally related. indeed, 5 is one of
the most potent ca iv and ca vii inhibitors ever reported, while acting as a much weaker inhibitor of the
ubiquitous isoform ca ii, which is often considered as
a house-keeping enzyme, whose inhibition is not desired.1,2,6 this is clearly a very important result, and
one which makes 5 a quite unique cai in the armamentarium of compounds showing isoform selective inhibitory properties.1,5–7 furthermore, in addition to the
isozymes mentioned above, 5 shows potent inhibitory
activity only against ca xii and ix, which are tumorassociated and thus not present in normal tissues,7–10
and against ca xiii, an isoform present in restricted
compartments of the genito-urinary tract in normal tissues.6c all these facts make 5 a selective inhibitor of isoforms iv and vii, a proﬁle which is completely new for
any known cai.1–6 this distinct inhibition proﬁle is in
fact unsimilar both to those of the thiadiazole/thiadiazoline clinically used inhibitors (1 and 3), as well as to
that of the related aliphatic antiepileptic sulfonamide
 xxxd3564xxx , 4. unlike 5, compounds 1 and 3 possess a
quite promiscuous inhibitory activity, acting as potent
inhibitors against many isozymes (e.g., acetazolamide
1 and  xxxd2592xxx  2 are potent inhibitors of all isoforms except ca i and iii), whereas  xxxd3564xxx  4 already shows a more modulated activity, being a potent
inhibitor of only isoforms i, ii, va, vi, and ix.
in order to better understand the interesting inhibitory
activity of 5 and also to learn some lessons for the drug
design of new cais based on this ring system/spacer, we
report the x-ray crystal structure of the hca ii–5 adduct (table 2).30–34 the three-dimensional structure of
the enzyme is very similar to that of hca ii without
any ligand bound,19,21,23–25 as judged by an rms devia-

tion for ca atoms of only 0.30 å. examination of the
initially calculated electron density maps in the activesite region showed clear evidence for the binding of a
single inhibitor molecule within the active site cavity.
the electron density of all moieties of the inhibitor is
in fact very well deﬁned (fig. 1).
the tetrahedral geometry of the zn2+ binding site and
the key hydrogen bonds between the so2nh2 moiety
of 5 and enzyme active site are all retained with respect to other hca ii-sulfonamide/sulfamate/sulfamide
complexes structurally characterized so far (figs. 1

ii active site. the zn(ii) ion of the enzyme, its three histidine ligands
(his94, 96, and 119), and residues involved in the binding of the
inhibitor (thr199, thr200, and gln92) are also shown.

and 2).5,19,21,23–25,35 in particular, the ionized nitrogen
atom of the sulfonamide group of 5 is coordinated to
the zinc ion at a distance of 1.90 å. this nitrogen
atom is also hydrogen bonded to the hydroxyl group
of thr199 (n–thr199og = 2.63 å), which in turn
interacts with the glu106oe1 atom (2.50 å, data
not shown). one oxygen atom of the coordinated sulfamoyl moiety is hydrogen bonded to the backbone
amide of thr199 (thrn–o2 = 2.70 å), whereas the
second oxygen atom of this moiety is 3.20 å away
from the catalytic zn2+ ion, being considered as
weakly coordinated to the metal ion.1,19,21,23–25,35 all
these interactions have also been observed in the adducts of hca ii with other sulfonamide inhibitors,
such as acetazolamide 1, 5-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-

figures represent distances (in å).

sulfonamide 2 or  xxxd3564xxx  4, but the corresponding
distances are of course diﬀerent.19,21–25,35 interestingly,
one of the endocyclic nitrogen atoms of the thiadiazole ring makes a strong hydrogen bond with the
oh moiety of thr200, of 3.14 å, an interaction not
observed earlier in any other adduct of hca ii with
1,3,4-thiadiazole-sulfonamide derivatives.35 the scaffold of 5 is accommodated perfectly within the active
site channel, being oriented toward the hydrophobic
half of it, and participating in several favorable interactions with various amino acid residues (figs. 1 and
2). thus, the 1,3,4-thiadiazole-methyl scaﬀold of the
inhibitor makes favorable van der waals contacts
(around 4 å) with amino acids lining the hydrophobic
half of the hca ii cavity (such as gln92, phe131,
val121, val143, and leu198). for example, the distance between the endocyclic sulfur atom of 5 and
the nitrogen atom of the carboxamido side chain of
gln92 is of 4 å (fig. 2). it is also interesting to note
that the dimethylamino moiety of 5 does not participate in any interaction with the enzyme nor with
water molecules from the active site, which may in
fact explain the medium potency inhibitory activity
of this compound. the same is true for the ch2
spacer between the zbg and the substituted-1,3,4thiadiazole ring (figs. 1 and 2). from this point of
view (i.e., scarcity of interactions between the enzyme
and the moiety in position 2 of the 1,3,4-thiadiazole
ring), 5 is rather similar to 2 (also a medium potency
ca ii inhibitor, ki of 60 nm) for which the crystal
structure in adduct with hca ii was recently reported
by our group.35
in order to try to understand the diﬀerent inhibition
proﬁles of compound 5 and the structurally related
derivatives 4, 6, and 7 investigated earlier,19,24 we have
also superposed the 3d structures of these four sulfonamides complexed within the hca ii active site (fig. 3).
figure 3a and b shows that although the last three compounds have a common 1,3,4-thiadiazolyl-methanesulfonamide scaﬀold, their binding to the enzyme is very
diﬀerent. indeed, only the so2nh2 moieties of the three
inhibitors are superposable, whereas the orientation of
the 1,3,4-thiadiazole rings and of the spacers between
the ring and the zbg is completely diﬀerent. for example, as shown by fisher et al.24 in the adduct of 6 with
hca ii the 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring participates in a pstacking interaction with the imidazole ring of his94,
an interaction not seen in the adducts of hca ii with
5 or 7 (fig. 3a). on the other hand, in the adduct of
hca ii with 7, the 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring adopted a
puckered conformation, which is again typical only for
that adduct. on the contrary, the derivative 5 investigated by us here shows an extended conformation of
the thiadiazole-methyl scaﬀold, which enables it to participate in an increased number of hydrophobic interactions (in addition to the polar ones mentioned above)
(fig. 3b). these data also indicate that as the 2-dimethylamino-moiety of 5 and 7 or the 2-amino- one in 6 does
not participate in any particular interactions with amino
acid residues in the active site, substituting this moiety
with functionalities which can interact with amino acid
residues situated at the entrance of the cavity, such as,

c. temperini et al. / bioorg. med. chem. lett. 18 (2008) 999–1005

1003

ch2 spacer is rather diﬀerent in the two adducts, but
the two ring systems (1,2-benzoxazole in 4, and 1,3,4thiadiazole in 5, respectively) lie approximately in the
same region of the ca ii active site. in fact, among
derivatives 1–5, the inhibition proﬁle of 5 is the most
similar just to that of  xxxd3564xxx  4, which can be understood also from these x-ray crystallographic data.
in conclusion, we investigated the interaction of 2-n,ndimethylamino-1,3,4-thiadiazole-5-methanesulfonamide
with the 12 catalytically active mammalian ca isozymes, ca i–xiv. the compound is a potent inhibitor
of ca iv, vii, ix, xii, and xiii (kis of 0.61–39 nm),
a medium potency inhibitor of ca ii and va (kis of
121–438 nm), and a weak inhibitor against the other
isoforms (ca iii, vb, vi, and xiv), making it a very
interesting candidate for situations in which a strong/
selective inhibition of certain isozymes is needed. the
crystal structure of the hca ii adduct of this sulfonamide revealed interesting interactions between the
inhibitor and the enzyme which are quite diﬀerent from
those observed in the adducts of ca ii with the structurally related 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazolyl-5-diﬂuoromethanesulfonamide or 2-dimethylamino-5-[sulfonamido(aminomethyl)]-1,3,4-thiadiazole reported earlier.

zbg are again not very much superposable, except for

29. khalifah, r. g. j. biol. chem. 1971, 246, 2561, an
applied photophysics stopped-ﬂow instrument has been
used for assaying the ca catalyzed co2 hydration
activity. phenol red (at a concentration of 0.2 mm) has
been used as indicator, working at the absorbance

maximum of 557 nm, with 10 mm hepes (ph 7.5) as
buﬀer, 0.1 m na2so4 (for maintaining constant the ionic
strength), following the ca-catalyzed co2 hydration
reaction for a period of 10–100 s. the co2 concentrations
ranged from 1.7 to 17 mm for the determination of the
kinetic parameters and inhibition constants. for each
inhibitor at least six traces of the initial 5–10% of the
reaction have been used for determining the initial
velocity. the uncatalyzed rates were determined in the
same manner and subtracted from the total observed
rates. stock solutions of inhibitor (0.1 mm) were prepared
in distilled-deionized water and dilutions up to 0.1 nm
were done thereafter with distilled-deionized water. inhibitor and enzyme solutions were preincubated together for
15 min at room temperature prior to assay, in order to
allow for the formation of the e-i complex. the inhibition
constants were obtained by non-linear least-squares methods using prism 3, as reported earlier,12–14 and represent
the mean from at least three diﬀerent determinations.
enzyme concentrations in the assay system were in the
range of 7.1– 13 nm.12–14.
30. the hca ii–5 complex was crystallized as previously
described. diﬀraction data were collected under cryogenic
conditions (100 k) on a ccd detector km4 ccd/
sapphire using cuka radiation (1.5418 å). the unit cell
dimensions were: a = 41.5 å, b = 42.1 å, c = 72.41 å and
a = c = 90, b = 104.25 in the space group p21. data were
processed with crysalis red (oxford diﬀraction 2006).31

the structure was analyzed by diﬀerence fourier
technique, using the pdb ﬁle 1ca2 as starting model.
the reﬁnement was carried out with the program
refmac532; model building and map inspections were
performed using the coot program.33 the ﬁnal model of
the complex hca ii–5 had an r-factor of 19.8% and
r-free 24.8% in the resolution range 20.0–1.9 å, with a
rms deviation from standard geometry of 0.009 å in bond
lengths and 1.36 in angles. the correctness of stereochemistry was ﬁnally checked using procheck.34
coordinates and structure factors have been deposited
with the protein data bank (accession code 3bl0).
crystallographic parameters and reﬁnement statistics are
summarized in table 2.
