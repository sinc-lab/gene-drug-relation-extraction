ascites; animal model; atrial natriuretic peptide
endogenous natriuretic peptides, atrial natriuretic peptide
(anp), brain-derived natriuretic peptide, c-type natriuretic
peptide, and urodilatin, regulate plasma volume and blood
pressure (43). these peptides stimulate natriuresis through the
inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, and avp secretion and function (28).
anp clearance occurs mainly in the kidney, lung, brain, and
heart and is a result of proteolysis by  xxxg1417xxx 
24.11 (nep) and, to a lesser extent, of binding to natriuretic
peptide clearance receptors (28, 50).
cirrhotic patients with ascites exhibit increased plasma anp
levels and exaggerated peak anp response during head-out
water immersion compared with healthy controls or cirrhotic
patients without ascites, due to increased anp cardiac release
(14, 35, 38). furthermore, it is of interest that the increase in
plasma anp during head-out water immersion in cirrhosis

cannot fully account for the natriuresis of immersion by itself,
due to other factors occurring in this setting, i.e., changes in
renal-sympathetic nerve traffic and blunting of renin secretion
(13). because higher anp levels occur in the setting of sodium
retention, this indicates that ascitic patients with cirrhosis
exhibit reduced natriuretic responses to this peptide, a finding
confirmed by infusion of anp in cirrhotic patients. furthermore, anp infusion determines hypotension in ascitic cirrhosis (17). the mechanisms of renal hyporesponsiveness to anp so
far identified are activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
axis and sympathoadrenergic tone as a consequence of the arterial
hypotensive effect of this hormone (49), downregulation of natriuretic peptide receptors a and b in the kidney (19), and increased
activity of cgmp phosphodiesterase, the enzyme degrading the
second messenger of anp (4). the occurrence of renal overexpression of nep as a possible cause of renal resistance to the
effects of anp has never been investigated in cirrhosis.
nep is a membrane-bound zn-metalloendopeptidase of the
brush-border membrane of kidney proximal tubule cells, of
lung myofibroblasts and epithelial cells, b lymphoid-progenitors, and glial cells (2, 25). on the surface membrane of these
cells, nep degrades bradykinin (11),  xxxg977xxx -like peptide
(9),  xxxg2240xxx  (15), anp (23),  xxxg80xxx  (29),  xxxg674xxx  (et-1) (1), and  xxxg99xxx  (15). not only does nep
degrade the above peptides but it produces the vasoconstrictor
polypeptide et-1 from circulating precursors (i.e., big-et-1
and et-11-31) (16, 32).
nep is specifically inhibited by  xxxd420xxx  (34), its prodrug  xxxd419xxx  (3), and by  xxxd3357xxx  (44), sinorphan (21),
and  xxxd2936xxx  (15). in healthy subjects, nep inhibitors
increase the concentrations of anp and cause natriuresis (21,
34) without affecting blood pressure (21, 34, 39). actually,
both  xxxd419xxx  (3) and  xxxd420xxx  (31) have been reported
to raise blood pressure in normotensive human subjects.
because nep inhibitors potentiate the effects of anp but do
not cause hypotension in other groups of patients (such as those
with cardiac failure) (34), we tested the hypothesis that
nep expression is increased in cirrhosis and that intravenous
 xxxd420xxx  would have a natriuretic effect without causing
hypotension.

 xxxg1417xxx  degrades atrial natriuretic peptide (anp) and
bradykinin and may generate  xxxg674xxx  from big-endothelin. in
advanced cirrhosis, sodium retention is accompanied by elevated
plasma anp levels, and infusion of anp causes hypotension, but in
normal humans increasing the concentration of anp through the
inhibition of  xxxg1417xxx , localized in renal proximal tubule
cells, causes natriuresis without any arterial pressure drop. the purpose of this study was the assessment of kidney  xxxg1417xxx 
expression and responses to  xxxd420xxx  (a specific inhibitor of this
enzyme) in rats with ccl4-induced cirrhosis. two groups of control rats
(n ⫽ 5) were injected with vehicle or 3 mg/kg  xxxd420xxx . three groups
of cirrhotic rats with ascites (n ⫽ 10) received vehicle alone or 3 or 10
mg/kg  xxxd420xxx . in cirrhotic rats, western blot analysis revealed a
170% increase in renal  xxxg1417xxx  protein content (p ⬍ 0.03),
mainly in the proximal nephron and macula densa, and both  xxxd420xxx 
dosages increased plasma anp levels, urinary volume, and urinary
excretion of sodium, anp, and cgmp compared with vehicle alone (all
p ⬍ 0.03).  xxxd420xxx  (10 mg/kg) also reduced tubular solute-free
water reabsorption (p ⬍ 0.03) in cirrhotic rats, but renal blood flow,
arterial pressure, and plasma renin activity were unaffected. neutral
endopeptidase inhibition has natriuretic and aquaretic actions in cirrhosis
without any effect on blood pressure and kidney perfusion due to a
significant overexpression of this enzyme in renal cortex.

gel) and transferred to a membrane (hypobond-pvdf, amersham
lifescience) by electroblotting in transfer buffer (48 mm tris, 39 mm
glycine, 0.037% sds, 20% methanol). nonspecific binding was
blocked with blocking solution (pbs, 0.05% tween 20, 5% nonfat dry
milk, 5% fetal calf serum), and blots were incubated with a rabbit
polyclonal nep antibody (cd 10, santa cruz biotechnology) and an
antibody against the receptor-associated protein (rap) at a dilution of
1:1,000 in pbs for 1 h at room temperature. after being washed three
times for 15 min in pbs, blots were incubated with the secondary
antibody (goat igg, sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. three
further washing steps (15 min each) in pbs were followed by
detection using an ecl detection kit (ecl western blotting detection,
amersham pharmacia biotech). densitometric quantification was
performed using rap expression as an internal standard: before any
comparison was made, the net intensity of nep bands in each
experiment was normalized to the intensity of the corresponding rap
band, used as an internal standard to evaluate the degree of nonspecific protein expression in the homogenate (26).
nep immunostaining. tissue samples were embedded in paraffin,
and standard immunohistochemistry procedures were applied using
the labeled streptavidin-biotin (lab-sa) and the aec-chromogenproducing red staining (zymed laboratories) methods. after fixation,
endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 1% h2o2. sections were incubated with a primary anti-cd 10-antibody for 16 h
(rabbit polyclonal, 2 ␮g/ml, sc-9149, santa cruz biotechnology).
staining with a nonspecific igg control antibody (sigma) served as
control.
plasma and urine analyses. plasma and urinary concentrations of
electrolytes were measured by flame photometry. inulin and pah
concentrations in plasma were determined colorimetrically (40, 46).
avp systemic concentrations were measured in edta plasma by
ria (vasopressin direct ria, buhlmann laboratories, postfach,
switzerland). urine and plasma anp was measured using a specific
ria (anp shionoria, cis bio international, gif-sur-yvette cedex,
france). pra was determined using ria for  xxxg99xxx  after an
incubation period of 2 h (renin maia kit, biodata, rome, italy). et-1

groups were fed ad libitum with standard chow and water. cirrhosis
was induced by ccl4 (riedel de haen, sigma, seelze, germany)
administered by gavage twice weekly (37). cirrhotic rats were studied
between 9 and 12 wk after the start of the cirrhosis induction program,
when ascites was fully developed. control rats were studied following
a similar period of standardized diet. experiments in rats were
performed in compliance with the procedures outlined in the italian
ministry of health guidelines (no. 86/609/eec) and according to the
principles of laboratory animal care (national institutes of health
publication no. 85–23, revised 1985).  xxxd420xxx , a specific nep
inhibitor (3, 34), was provided by pfizer central research (sandwich,
sussex, uk).
animal groups.  xxxd420xxx  was dissolved in 5% glucose solution
as diluent to obtain two different solutions to be administered intravenously to the rats in the same volume of fluid (1 ml), producing two
different bolus doses, 3 or 10 mg/kg body wt.
the rats were divided into 5 groups: 5 control rats receiving diluent
alone, 5 control rats receiving 3 mg/kg body wt  xxxd420xxx , 10
cirrhotic rats receiving diluent alone, 10 cirrhotic rats receiving 3
mg/kg body wt  xxxd420xxx , and 10 cirrhotic rats receiving 10 mg/kg
body wt  xxxd420xxx .
study protocol. the rats were anesthetized with a mixture of
ketavet 100 (farmaceutici gellini, sabaudia, italy) and rompum
(4:1, vol/vol, xilazina, bayer, leverkusen, germany) by intraperitoneal injection (0.5 ml mixture/200 g body wt). blood was sampled
(time 0) by cardiac puncture (0.5 ml), and 10% inulin (wt/vol,
 xxxd2163xxx -gesellschaft, linz/donau, austria) plus 20% pah (wt/vol,
nephrotest, bag, munich, germany) were administered intravenously into the caudal vein as a priming bolus (0.14 and 0.03 ml/kg,
respectively) followed by a continuous infusion of 0.09 ml 䡠 kg⫺1 䡠 h⫺1
inulin and 0.025 ml 䡠 kg⫺1 䡠 h⫺1 pah for 150 min to assess glomerular
filtration rate (gfr) and renal plasma flow (rpf) at different times by
means of their respective steady-state plasma clearances (cin and
cpah) (10, 30). after 90 min of inulin plus pah infusion (i.e., once
their steady-state plasma concentrations were reached) (10), a laparotomy was performed and the urinary bladder was emptied; a clamp
was positioned on the urethral orifice. cardiac blood was then sampled (time 1) to assess basal values of cin and cpah, and then either
diluent alone or  xxxd420xxx  (f3 or f10) was injected as a single bolus
into the right femoral vein. cardiac blood was then sampled (0.5 ml)
at precise intervals (20 min) for 1 h (times 2– 4) to measure plasma
osmolarity and concentrations of inulin, pah, sodium, and potassium.
at each blood withdrawal, the volume of blood withdrawn was
replaced with an equal volume of intravenous saline. blood samples
withdrawn at time 4 (i.e., 60 min after the infusion of diluent or 3 or
10 mg/kg body wt  xxxd420xxx ) were also used to measure plasma
concentrations of avp, anp, et-1, and plasma renin activity (pra).
one hour after  xxxd420xxx  or vehicle injection, after collection from
the bladder of the urine produced during the 60 min after  xxxd420xxx 
or vehicle administration, the rats were killed by exsanguination
through the aorta. the urine was used to determine osmolarity and the
excretion of sodium, potassium, chloride, anp, and cgmp. in a
further group of five anesthetized cirrhotic rats, mean arterial pressure
was evaluated by means of tail sphygmomanometry (blood pressure
recorder 8005, w⫹w electronic, milan, italy) before and 40 min
after 10 mg/kg intravenous administration of  xxxd420xxx  in the
caudal vein, without performance of a laparotomy.
nep protein concentration in rat kidneys. for western blot analysis, membrane fractions were prepared from kidneys removed from
five rats in each experimental group (g1-g5); 100-␮g slices were
homogenized in  xxxd3449xxx  (20 mm tris, 2 mm mgcl2, 0.25 m
sucrose, 1 mm pmsf, ph 7.5) and centrifuged at 1,000 g and 4°c for
10 min. the supernatant was centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 g for 10 min and
at 100,000 g for 45 min. the pellet was dissolved in  xxxd3449xxx  (50
mm tris, 2 mm mgcl2, 80 mm nacl, 1 mm pmsf, ph 8.0), and the
protein content was determined using a modified bradford assay
(bio-rad) using bsa as a standard. protein (15 ␮g) was loaded on

discussion

in advanced cirrhosis, splanchnic vasodilatation activates
the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, sympathetic nervous
system, and nonosmotic hypersecretion of avp, with ensuing
renal sodium and water retention and ascites development (8,
22). this sodium and water retention is treated with diuretic
drugs that determine a further stimulation of renin secretion
and may even lead to prerenal azotemia. therefore, a drug able
to enhance exclusively the renal vasodilator, natriuretic, and
avp-antagonistic actions of anp but be devoid of the systemic hypotensive effects of this hormone would be of outstanding importance in treating cirrhotic ascites.
the effects of nep inhibitors in cirrhosis have been evaluated in two previous studies. dussaule et al. (12) administered
single oral doses of sinorphan to 16 patients with ascitic
cirrhosis and observed increases in plasma anp, a natriuretic
response, a significant reduction of plasma renin activity, and
no effects on arterial pressure. park et al. (36) observed that
 xxxd3357xxx  caused natriuresis but did not alter cardiac output and
systemic vascular resistance in cirrhotic rats. neither study
evaluated the effects of nep inhibition on renal perfusion and
free water metabolism, avp plasma levels, and anp urinary

effect on plasma renin activity, et-1, or avp levels (table 1).
both  xxxd420xxx  dosages significantly raised urinary excretion of anp (fig. 4) and cgmp in cirrhotic animals. cirrhotic
rats infused with  xxxd420xxx  had a significantly lower urinary
cgmp/sodium ratio, suggesting that potentiation of natriuretic
peptide function is not the sole mechanism that increases
natriuresis after nep inhibition.  xxxd420xxx  had no effect on
blood pressure [89 ⫾ 27 vs. 86 ⫾ 37 mmhg (p ⫽ 0.37)] in
cirrhotic rats.
renal function. in cirrhotic rats, both 3 and 10 mg/kg
 xxxd420xxx  caused marked diuresis and increased absolute
(fig. 5) and fractional excretion of sodium; a significant
reduction of tubular solute-free water reabsorption and urinary
osmolarity was observed after 10 mg/kg  xxxd420xxx  (table
2). because fena was also moderately decreased in the control
group receiving vehicle alone, a certain degree of reduction of
the circulating fluid volume due to the experimental procedures
cannot be ruled out; the increased urine osmolarity and tubular
free water reabsorption observed in the cirrhotic group confirm
the occurrence of free water retention in those rats.  xxxd420xxx  had no effect on rpf, gfr, or ff.
correlations. in both controls and cirrhotic rats, there were
significant correlations between ff and diuresis (respectively,

between urinary excretion of cgmp and that of sodium.

natriuresis were correlated only when control or cirrhotic rats
were given vehicle, but not in the  xxxd420xxx -treated groups;
3) compared with cirrhotic rats receiving vehicle, the  xxxd420xxx -treated cirrhotic groups had higher urinary sodium excretions for any given value of cgmp urinary excretion (table
1); and 4) when inhibition of nep is accompanied by administration of bradykinin or  xxxg80xxx  antagonists, blunted
natriuretic effects are found (11, 29). indeed, in the model of
dogs with ascites due to chronic constriction of the supradiaphragmatic vena cava (chronic caval dogs), it was postulated
that, during nep inhibition, increased delivery of both kinins
and anp distally to the cortical collecting duct allowed a
natriuresis in the animals resistant to the sole infusion of
exogenous anp (27). last, nep inhibition might also account
for decreased degradation of kaliuretic peptides derived from
anp prohormone (48), because  xxxd420xxx  determined a
strong tendency toward increased absolute potassium excretion
and fek (table 2).
in the kidneys of cirrhotic rats, we found overexpression of
nep (figs. 1 and 2), mainly in the proximal convoluted
tubules, macula densa, bowman’s capsule, and mesangium
(fig. 3). consequently, anp urinary excretion in cirrhotic rats
was significantly lower than in either group of healthy animals
(table 1) despite similar gfr values (table 2). this finding,
previously described in chronic caval dogs with ascites (27),
confirms enhanced tubular degradation of anp in cirrhosis.
accordingly, the lower  xxxd420xxx  dose we used caused a
significant increase in absolute sodium excretion and fena
only in rats with cirrhosis (table 2 and fig. 5). nep overexpression has been found to contribute to anp resistance also in
rats with congestive heart failure (26).
the cause of nep overexpression in cirrhotic rat kidneys is
unknown; however, several cytokines whose systemic levels
are increased in liver cirrhosis (47), interleukin-1,  xxxg2296xxx -␣, transforming growth factor-␤, and interleukin-6, enhance the in vitro expression of nep on the surface of
fibroblasts and bronchial and kidney tubular epithelial cells
(3, 9).
in agreement with the findings of park et al. (36), in our
study nep inhibition did not cause significant changes in et-1
plasma levels in cirrhotic rats. previous studies have reported
widespread results: newaz et al. (33) found a reduction in
plasma et-1 after  xxxd419xxx  administration in arterial hypertensive rats. asaad et al. (5) reported that nep did not con-

excretion. finally, the kidney biomolecular expression of nep
in cirrhosis has never been investigated.
we observed that nep inhibition with  xxxd420xxx  significantly increased anp urinary excretion in rats with ascitic
cirrhosis (fig. 4) while causing a smaller increase in plasma
anp (table 1), leading to increased cgmp and sodium urinary
excretion rates (fig. 5) and decreased tubular solute-free water
reabsorption. no effects on mean arterial pressure, pra, and
avp secretion were found (tables 1 and 2). these results
confirm that if delivery of anp to the renal tubules is increased, anp effects may be targeted to the required site.
the increase in fena produced by  xxxd420xxx , without any
change in gfr, suggests exclusive tubular actions of this drug.
it has been proposed that nep inhibitors might decrease
proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium and water (7, 15),
because, in isolated microperfused tubule models, anp decreases  xxxg99xxx -stimulated proximal tubular sodium reabsorption (18, 24). the aquaretic action of 10 mg/kg  xxxd420xxx  (table 2) strengthens this assumption, as any increase in
distal tubular delivery of fluid enhances the capacity of the
cortical portion of the ascending limb of henle to generate free
water (42).
further tubular diuretic mechanisms of  xxxd420xxx  probably exist: 1) nep inhibitors may reduce intrarenal levels of
sodium-retaining factors (45) because enhancement of anp
tubular content by nep inhibition limits renin secretion by
targeting the macula densa (12, 23); 2) urinary anp and

tribute to the in vivo clearance of et-1 in rats, whereas in a
study in rabbits grantham et al. (20) demonstrated a reduction
in aortic tissue concentration of et-1, despite plasma concentrations of et-1 being increased, after nep inhibition. these
variable results are explained by the curious behavior of nep,
an enzyme that, depending on location and available substrates,
can inactivate et-1 or produce this hormone via hydrolysis of
big-et-1 and et-1(1-31) (32).
our study has identified a new target for future therapeutic
regimens aimed at treating patients with liver cirrhosis and
sodium and water retention. furthermore, improved understanding of the subtle biohumoral modifications occurring in
the kidney after inhibition of  xxxg1417xxx  may provide a valid occasion for knowledge of this clinical syndrome
to advance further.
