 xxxd3078xxx  is a selective  xxxg1476xxx / xxxg1477xxx  agonist, indicated
for insomnia treatment. safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics,
and cognitive performance were evaluated following increasing  xxxd3078xxx  doses. healthy adults (35-65 years) were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 5 oral  xxxd3078xxx  doses (4, 8, 16,
32, or 64 mg; n = 8 per group) or placebo (n = 20). cmax and
auc∞ (mean [%cv]) increased with each dose: cmax = 1.15
(109), 5.73 (97), 6.92 (77), 17.4 (76), and 25.9 (77) ng/ml, respectively, and auc∞ = 1.71 (114), 6.95 (108), 9.88 (78), 22.5
(80), and 36.1 (71 ng•h/ml), respectively. mean tmax values of
0.75 to 0.94 hours and mean elimination half-life of 0.83 to
1.90 hours remained relatively constant.  xxxd3078xxx  was extensively metabolized. besides  xxxd3078xxx , 4 metabolites, m-i,

m-ii, m-iii, and m-iv, were measured in serum. metabolite mii, which has shown weak  xxxd3078xxx -like activity in vitro, was
the major metabolite in serum. digit symbol substitution
test and visual analog scale alertness scores were similar
across all dose groups and did not differ from placebo. all adverse events were mild or moderate and resolved before study
completion.

r

receptors.2 because of its high selectivity for the  xxxg1476xxx /
mt2 receptors,  xxxd3078xxx  was developed as a treatment
for insomnia without the potential side effects associated with sedative hypnotics such as zaleplon,
zolpidem, and  xxxd2047xxx , which act via gabaabenzodiazepine receptor complexes located throughout the brain.  xxxd3078xxx  has no effect on gaba receptors, and it is not a scheduled drug.1
 xxxd3078xxx  is rapidly absorbed3 with peak serum
concentrations at less than 1 hour. a radiolabeled drug
study4 has shown that 84% of the administered radioactivity was excreted in the urine and 4% in the feces,
indicating that at least 84% of  xxxd3078xxx  is absorbed. in
serum, unchanged  xxxd3078xxx  is a minor component;
the major component is the monohydroxylated metabolite m-ii (figure 1). excretion of unchanged  xxxd3078xxx 
in urine is negligible, suggesting extensive first-pass
metabolism of  xxxd3078xxx . this was confirmed in an absolute bioavailability study5 in which, relative to
 xxxd3078xxx  given intravenously, mean systemic
availability of oral  xxxd3078xxx  was less than 2%.

amelteon, approved in the united states for the
treatment of insomnia, is an orally active hypnotic
drug, (s)-n-[2-(1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2h-indeno[5,4b]furan-8-yl)ethyl]propionamide ( xxxd3033xxx ; molecular weight = 259.34; figure 1), containing 1 chiral
center.1 the marketed drug is produced as a single (s)enantiomer.
 xxxg1476xxx /mt2 receptors are implicated in the effects of
endogenous melatonin on sleep and circadian
rhythmicity.  xxxd3078xxx  shows a high affinity for the
 xxxg1476xxx /mt2 receptors and little affinity for numerous
other receptors, including mt3, neurotransmitters,
neuropeptides, cytokines, ion-channel activators and
inhibitors, or dopaminerigic, gabaergic, and opiate

disposition kinetics and tolerance of  xxxd3078xxx 

figure 1. metabolic pathways of  xxxd3078xxx  in humans.  xxxd3078xxx  is extensively metabolized primarily by carboxylation and stereoselective
hydroxylation. ring-opening biotransformation results in the formation of m-i, and hydroxylation of the carboxy-metabolite, m-iii, results in
formation of m-iv. the major metabolite of  xxxd3078xxx  in serum is the monohydroxylated metabolite, m-ii.

in vitro protein binding of  xxxd3078xxx  is approximately 82% in human serum, which is independent of
concentrations likely to occur in humans.1 seventy
percent of the drug is bound in human  xxxg124xxx ,
accounting for most of the binding.  xxxd3078xxx  is not
distributed selectively to red blood cells.
 xxxd3078xxx  is metabolized primarily via oxidation to
hydroxyl and carbonyl derivatives, with secondary
metabolism producing glucuronide conjugates. 1
cyp1a2 is the major isozyme involved in the hepatic
metabolism of  xxxd3078xxx ; the  xxxg584xxx   xxxg585xxx   xxxg587xxx  subfamily and
cyp3a4 isozymes are also involved to a minor degree.
compared to dosing with 16 mg of  xxxd3078xxx  under
a fasting state,  xxxd3078xxx  administration with food6 re-

pharmacokinetics

sulted in a 31% increase in auc∞ and a 22% decrease
in cmax, while the median value for tmax was delayed by
about 55 minutes. because of the delayed tmax when
taken with food, it is recommended that  xxxd3078xxx  not
be taken with or immediately after a high-fat meal.1
the current study examined the safety, tolerability,
and pharmacokinetics of 5 ascending single doses of
 xxxd3078xxx  administered to healthy adult volunteers.
because cognitive performance and alertness are important safety considerations for a sleep-promoting
agent, these factors were assessed using the digit symbol substitution test (dsst) of cognitive performance
and a visual analog scale (vas) of alertness. the
pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd3078xxx ’s metabolites
were also evaluated.

methods
study population
sixty subjects (age 35-65 years) were enrolled at a single center (ppd development, austin, tex). only subjects who were within 20% of their ideal body weight,
as established by the 1983 metropolitan life insurance
company tables,7 were eligible for study participation.
female participants were required to be either surgically sterile or postmenopausal for at least 1 year. volunteers were excluded if they had a history of clinically significant disease, had taken any prescription
medication within the preceding 14 days or over-thecounter medication within the preceding 7 days, or
had received any investigational medication within
the preceding 30 days. subjects who had a history of alcohol abuse or positive urine drug test results, had used
alcohol or caffeine within the preceding 48 hours, or
had used tobacco products within the preceding 90
days were also excluded. concomitant medications
were not permitted during the course of the study.
this study was conducted in accordance with the
international conference on harmonization of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals
for human use, good clinical practice guidelines, and
the ethical principles of the declaration of helsinki.
the investigational review board, research consultants review committee (austin, tex), approved the
study protocol prior to the enrollment of study subjects. all volunteers gave written informed consent
prior to their participation in the study.
study design and procedure
participants were stratified by gender and randomly
assigned to 1 of 5 groups corresponding to the 5 dose
levels studied: 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64 mg. each group was
composed of 12 participants (9 men, 3 women). within
each group, participants were randomized to receive a
single dose of either  xxxd3078xxx  (6 men, 2 women) or
placebo (3 men, 1 woman). thus, 20 participants overall received placebo and 40 received  xxxd3078xxx . study
personnel and participants were blinded to treatment
assignment.
subjects were monitored while confined to the
clinic the evening before drug administration and ending 24 hours after drug administration. each subject received a single oral dose of study drug or placebo at
7:00 am following a 10-hour fast; subjects were exposed to normal indoor light for 12 hours after drug administration. each subject received the same number of
tablets of identical form for each dose level and match142 • j clin pharmacol 2006;46:140-148

ing placebo (1 tablet for 4-mg dose, 2 tablets for 8-mg
dose, 4 tablets for 16-mg dose, 5 tablets for 32-mg dose,
and 7 tablets for 64-mg dose; dose strengths for
 xxxd3078xxx  tablets were 1 mg, 4 mg, and 10 mg). because
this was an ascending dose study, the group receiving
the lowest dose was treated first. subsequent groups
were treated in an ascending manner if no limiting adverse events were experienced at the lower doses.
prespecified rules for stopping dose escalation were
based on vital signs, electrocardiogram findings, adverse events (including cardiovascular and central
nervous system effects), and clinical laboratory results.
analysis of serum sample
blood samples for pharmacokinetic analyses were collected at baseline and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6,
9, 12, 16, and 24 hours after drug administration. samples were collected in a vacutainer tube and allowed to
clot at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes. they
were then centrifuged at 2000 revolutions per minute
for 15 minutes at 4°c. the serum fraction was separated, frozen at –20°c, and shipped on dry ice to an accredited laboratory (ppd development, middleton,
wis) for measurement of parent drug and metabolite
concentrations.
serum concentrations of  xxxd3078xxx  and its metabolites (m-i, m-ii, m-iii, and m-iv) were simultaneously
measured by the use of liquid chromatography–tandem
mass spectrometry. the pe sciex 3000 was operated in
the positive turbo ion spray mode. the internal standard used for the determination of  xxxd3078xxx , m-ii, miii, and m-iv was deuterated  xxxd3078xxx  and for m-i was
deuterated m-i. chromatography was performed on an
ymc j’sphere s4 m80 column (150 × 2.0 mm) at a temperature of 40°c using a mobile phase of 5 mm ammonium acetate:acetonitrile:methanol (60:30:10) at 0.2
ml/min. the samples were analyzed via selected reaction monitoring by use of the transition of the precursor
ion to a product ion for each analyte and internal standard. the ion transitions monitored were mass-tocharge ratio (m/z) 260 to m/z 204 for  xxxd3078xxx , m/z
292 to m/z 218 for m-i, m/z 276 to m/z 159 for m-ii, m/z
274 to m/z 218 for m-iii, m/z 290 to m/z 254 for m-iv,
m/z 265 to m/z 205 for deuterated  xxxd3078xxx , and m/z
297 to m/z 219 for deuterated m-i. the standard curve
range for  xxxd3078xxx  was 0.050 ng/ml to 20.0 ng/ml
and for the metabolites was 0.50 ng/ml to 200 ng/ml.
the interassay coefficient of variation (cv) during
validation ranged from 12.0% to 4.07%, and the analytical recovery ranged from 90.4% to 103% across
all analytes. when 0.3 ml of human serum was used,
the lower limit of quantitation was 0.05 ng/ml and

disposition kinetics and tolerance of  xxxd3078xxx 

0.5 ng/ml for unchanged  xxxd3078xxx  and its metabolites, respectively.
cognitive performance and alertness
cognitive performance was assessed with the dsst,
carried out before drug administration (baseline) and at
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after administration. for the
dsst, subjects were given a set of symbols with corresponding single-digit numbers and blank boxes with
corresponding digits. the number of correct symbolfor-digit substitutions within a 2-minute time period
was recorded. at the same time intervals, a vas was
used to assess each participant’s perception of his or
her own level of alertness. each participant was asked,
“how alert do you feel right now?” and instructed to
score their response on a 10-cm line. at the far left end
of the vas, 0 indicated “sleepy,” and at the far right
end, 10 indicated “wide awake and alert.”
statistical analysis
descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, cv, minimum and maximum values)
were used to summarize data. in addition, the geometric mean was computed for cmax, auclqc, and auc∞.
pharmacokinetic parameters for  xxxd3078xxx  and its metabolites measured in serum were evaluated by
noncompartmental methods using winnonlin version
4.0 (pharsight inc, cary, nc). in this report, the parameters for only the clinically important analytes,
 xxxd3078xxx  and m-ii, are presented in detail. the maximum serum concentration (cmax) and the time at which
cmax was attained (tmax) were obtained by inspection
without extrapolation of the data. the elimination rate
constant (kel) was determined for each subject by
performing linear regression analysis of the terminal
log-linear portion of the semilogarithmic serum concentration versus time curves. the terminal half-life
(t1/2) was calculated from kel using the equation t1/2 =
0.693/kel. the area under the serum concentrationtime curve (auclqc) from 0 hours to the last quantifiable
concentration (clast) was estimated using the linear
trapezoidal method. the area under the serum concentration-time curve from 0 hours to infinity (auc∞) was
calculated as auclqc + clast/kel. the apparent oral serum
clearance (cl/f) of  xxxd3078xxx  was calculated as cl/f =
dose/auc∞ for each dose of  xxxd3078xxx .
an analysis of dose proportionality for  xxxd3078xxx 
and its active metabolite m-ii was performed for the
auc∞ and cmax using the power model8 in which log y =
alpha + beta•dose, where beta is the slope, alpha is an intercept, and
y represents the pharmacokinetic parameter (cmax or
pharmacokinetics

auc∞). the key feature of the power model is the assumption of linearity between log-transformed values
of parameters and doses. the mean slope of the logtransformed parameters against log dose was estimated,
and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals were
constructed. dose proportionality was concluded if the
slope was not significantly different from unity at the
5% level.
results
tolerance and safety
all 60 participants who enrolled completed the study.
table i lists the demographic data of the subjects participating in the study. the mean age of the participants
was 48.3 years (range, 36-65 years), and their mean
body mass index was 25.4 kg/m2 (range, 19.3-31.3 kg/
m2). forty-eight of the 60 were white, 2 were black, and
10 were hispanic. overall, 8 adverse events were reported by 5 subjects receiving  xxxd3078xxx  and 1 receiving placebo. the most common adverse events were
somnolence (n = 2) and nausea (n = 2). all adverse
events were mild or moderate in intensity, and no serious adverse events were reported. no dose-related
trends in adverse events were observed. only 1 patient
experienced a change in a clinical result: a clinically
significant elevation in  xxxd3368xxx 
in a subject who received 4 mg of  xxxd3078xxx .
pharmacokinetics
figures 2 and 3 illustrate mean serum concentration
versus time curves of  xxxd3078xxx  and m-ii, respectively,
following a 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, or 64-mg oral dose of
 xxxd3078xxx  given under a fasting state. the mean (%cv)
and minimum and maximum values for pharmacokinetic parameters of  xxxd3078xxx  and m-ii are shown in
table ii. mean cmax, auclqc, and auc∞ values increased
with each increasing dose in a dose-proportional manner. there was high variability in these parameters for
 xxxd3078xxx  compared to m-ii.  xxxd3078xxx  was rapidly
absorbed and extensively metabolized at all dose levels
after oral administration. the mean tmax values for
 xxxd3078xxx  ranged from 0.75 to 0.94 hours, and the
mean elimination half-life ranged from 0.83 to 1.90
hours. values for oral cl/f of  xxxd3078xxx  were large
(3000 l/h after an 8 mg dose) and highly variable.
semilogarithmic concentration versus time curves
of  xxxd3078xxx  and its metabolites m-i through m-iv after a single 16-mg dose are shown in figure 4. auc∞
values in figure 5 show that m-i and m-iii, both inactive metabolites, were minor and undetectable after 4

dsst scores increased within the first 4 hours of treatment for all groups, including the placebo group; this is
probably the result of a learning effect. the dsst
scores with each dose of  xxxd3078xxx  were no different
from their placebo controls. mean vas alertness scores
at 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-mg doses of  xxxd3078xxx  and placebo are shown in figure 8. although some fluctuation

discussion
two important pharmacokinetic characteristics of a
sleep-promoting drug are fast absorption for the rapid
onset of a pharmacologic effect and a short half-life to
minimize next-day effects. the recommended 8-mg
dose of  xxxd3078xxx  meets both criteria: it was rapidly
absorbed giving a tmax value within 1 hour, and it was
also rapidly eliminated with a mean elimination halflife of 1.36 hours after an 8 mg dose.
the present study showed wide intersubject variability in the peak (cmax) and total (auc) systemic exposures of  xxxd3078xxx  (cv about 100%) at all doses
studied. however,  xxxd3078xxx  is well tolerated at a wide

range of doses. this is evidenced in the present study
by the small number of adverse events reported at
doses ranging from 4 mg to 64 mg (equivalent auc∞ =
1.71 to 36.1 ngⴢh/ml), as well as by data from safety
and efficacy clinical trials9-11 that demonstrate a flat
dose versus efficacy relationship. together, these findings indicate that despite the wide intersubject variability in  xxxd3078xxx  systemic exposure, individualization of  xxxd3078xxx  dosing is not necessary. the
recommended dose of  xxxd3078xxx  is 8 mg given at bedtime.1 because of slower oral absorption when taken
with food, it is also recommended that  xxxd3078xxx  not
be taken with or immediately after a high-fat meal.
after a 16-mg dose, the mean systemic exposures of
 xxxd3078xxx  and its metabolites m-i, m-ii, m-iii, and miv were 9.88, 9.83, 385, 4.68, and 70.4 ngⴢh/ml, respectively. the metabolites m-i and m-iii are both minor
and inactive. m-iv had about 7-fold greater exposure
than  xxxd3078xxx  did, but it, too, is inactive. the major
metabolite in serum was m-ii, having exposure approximately 39-fold greater than that of  xxxd3078xxx . this metabolite has one fifth to one tenth the binding affinity of
 xxxd3078xxx  for the human  xxxg1476xxx  and mt2 receptors, and it
is 17- to 25-fold less potent than  xxxd3078xxx  in in vitro
functional assays. although systemic exposure of m-ii
is significantly higher than that of  xxxd3078xxx , one cannot determine how much m-ii actually contributes to
the overall activity of  xxxd3078xxx  when orally administered to humans since the precise magnitude and time

course of its activity cannot be ascertained without administering m-ii to humans. although m-ii is the major
metabolite in serum, its urinary excretion is negligible,
indicating that it also undergoes further metabolism
prior to excretion in urine.12
both men and women were included in our studies
since  xxxd3078xxx  is intended to be used in both sexes.
the 1:3 ratio of women to men in both the placebo and
active treatment groups was included to get an early
signal on possible gender effect on tolerance of
 xxxd3078xxx  and its disposition kinetics. a lack of gender
effects on the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3078xxx , however,
was demonstrated in a study specifically designed to
evaluate the effect of age and gender on  xxxd3078xxx 
pharmacokinetics.13
in the present study,  xxxd3078xxx  was administered in
the morning, although, as a sleep-promoting agent,
 xxxd3078xxx  is intended to be taken at bedtime. morning
dosing was necessary since we simultaneously evaluated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
the drug. this assessment would not have been possible if the drug was given at bedtime and subjects were
allowed to sleep. the possible differences in  xxxd3078xxx 
pharmacokinetics following morning and nighttime
dosing is not known; it is the opinion of the authors that
it is unlikely to be of clinical significance.
in the pharmacodynamic assessments, subjects reported no decline in levels of alertness (vas) at doses
less than 64 mg and exhibited no comparative declines

in cognitive performance (dsst) at any dose. indeed,
dsst scores improved for each successive dose group
within the first 4 hours, including the placebo group.
this increase was most likely due to a learning effect.
a treatment for insomnia that promotes sleep without residual pharmacologic effects is clinically desirable. in phase 2 and 3 trials, nighttime  xxxd3078xxx  administration reduced sleep latency and increased total
sleep time with no apparent next-day residual
psychomotor or memory impairments, as measured by
the dsst and memory tests.9-11,14 long-term administration (5 weeks) of  xxxd3078xxx  in patients with chronic
insomnia also demonstrated sustained sleep-promoting
effects, with no evidence of either rebound insomnia or
withdrawal symptoms after treatment was discontinued.10,11 in a study by griffiths et al,15 subjects given 160
mg of  xxxd3078xxx  (20 times the recommended therapeutic dose) were able to successfully perform a wide variety of motor and cognitive performance tasks at various
time points up to 24 hours after study drug administra-

tion, indicating a lack of psychomotor impairment
even at peak serum concentrations.
in conclusion,  xxxd3078xxx ’s rapid oral absorption and
its relatively short elimination half-life make it a
pharmacokinetically suitable drug for sleep-promoting
therapy.  xxxd3078xxx  has 1 active metabolite, m-ii (human receptor binding affinity about one fifth to one
tenth of the parent drug and 17- to 25-fold less potent
than  xxxd3078xxx  in in vitro function assays), with a systemic exposure approximately 39-fold higher than the
parent drug at the 16-mg dose. there is wide
intersubject variability (cv 100%) in the systemic exposure (auc) of  xxxd3078xxx , but because of  xxxd3078xxx ’s
wide therapeutic window, large safety margin, and flat
efficacy versus dose relationship, the intersubject variability does not require individualization in drug dosing.  xxxd3078xxx  is recommended at a dose of 8 mg at
bedtime.
