macrophage fcg receptors have an important role
in host defense and the pathophysiology of immune
mediated disorders. alteration of splenic macrophage fcg receptors expression predisposes to severe
infection. inhibition or blockade of splenic macrophage fcg receptors is one of the mechanisms by
which immune cytopenias improve. dopaminergic
drugs have clinically significant regulatory functions
on the immune response. using an experimental
model in the guinea pig we assessed the effect of
commonly used dopaminergic drugs on the expression of macrophage fc g receptors. three dopaantagonists,  xxxd372xxx , leuprolide, and pergolide, and seven dopa-antagonists, chlorpromazine,
sch 23390,  xxxd2624xxx , sulpiride, veralipride,
 xxxd115xxx , and  xxxd1708xxx , were studied. following
guinea pig treatment with dopaminergic drugs, the
clearance of igg-sensitized rbcs in vivo, the in vitro
binding of igg-sensitized rbcs by isolated splenic
macrophages and flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies were performed. treatment with dopaagonists enhanced the clearance of igg-sensitized
rbcs, the in vitro binding of igg-sensitized rbcs by
isolated splenic macrophages, and the cell surface expression of both macrophage fcg receptors, and vice
versa, dopa-antagonists impaired macrophage fcg receptors expression. macrophage fcgr1,2 was more
sensitive than fcgr2 to such dopaminergic effect.
these alterations of macrophage fcg receptors expression are mediated by both d1 and d2 dopamine
receptors, with a major participation of d2 receptors.

introduction

splenic macrophage fcg receptors have a critical role
in host defense. patients with end-stage renal disease
(1) or cirrhosis (2) have an altered function of their
splenic macrophage fcg receptors which predisposes
them to severe infections. splenic macrophage fcg receptors are also involved in the pathophysiology of
immune mediated disorders by their role in the clearance of immune complexes (3–7). inhibition (8, 9) or
blockade (10) of splenic macrophage fcg receptors is
one of the mechanisms by which immune cytopenias
improve.
dopaminergic agents have immunoregulatory actions. treatment with  xxxd372xxx , a dopa-agonist
that inhibits prolactin (prl) secretion, ameliorates autoimmune diseases and contributes to the treatment of
graft rejection (11, 12). chlorpromazine is a dopaantagonist of the phenothiazine family that has been
associated with autoimmune diseases with a preponderant humoral autoimmune component (13–18). in
addition, chlorpromazine inhibits delayed-type hypersensitivity responses (19) and prevents lethal endotoxinemia in mice (20). we have previously observed that
veralipride, a dopa-antagonist, inhibits macrophage
fcg receptors expression (21).
using an experimental model in the guinea pig (3, 4,
8, 9) we studied the effect of the administration of
dopaminergic drugs on splenic macrophage fcg receptors expression as potential therapeutic agents in immune cytopenias and immune complex diseases. dopaagonists increased splenic macrophage fcg receptors
expression, whereas dopa-antagonists impaired splenic
macrophage fcg receptors expression. the effect of
dopaminergic drugs on macrophage fcg receptors depends on both d1 and d2 dopamine receptors, with a
predominant  xxxg656xxx  participation. dopaminergic
drugs altered the function of both guinea pig macrophage fcg receptor classes. fcgr1,2 was more sensitive to such dopaminergic action than the other guinea
pig macrophage fcg receptor, fcgr2.

methods

all studies were performed with 500- to 600-g male
duncan–hartley guinea pigs obtained from criffa,
barcelona, spain. animals were injected with equal
volumes of a solution of dopaminergic drugs in pbs as
previously reported (22, 23). sham controls received 1
ml of pbs not containing dopaminergic drugs. all animals were injected sc in the dorsal neck fat pad every
afternoon for 7 consecutive days and studied on the day
after the last injection. chlorpromazine (clp) was obtained from sigma chemical co. and sch 23390 from
research biochemicals inc. (natick, ma).  xxxd2624xxx  (m), sulpiride (s), veralipride (v),  xxxd115xxx 
(a),  xxxd1708xxx  (cs),  xxxd372xxx  (b), leuprolide (l),
and pergolide (p) were obtained from the pharmacy.
rabbit igg anti-guinea pig rbc antibodies were prepared as previously described and isolated by
sephacryl s-300 gel filtration and qae ion exchange
chromatography (pharmacia, piscataway, nj), and
were free of igm as determined by ouchterlony analysis and sds–page (3, 4, 8, 9).
clearance of igg-coated erythrocytes. blood was
drawn from anesthetized guinea pigs by cardiac puncture. washed erythrocytes were radiolabeled with
51
cr-sodium chromate (amersham, madrid, spain)
and sensitized with an equal volume of igg antibody,
so as to be coated with approximately 800 igg molecules per erythrocyte as described (3, 4, 8, 9). animals
treated with dopaminergic drugs or pbs control for 7
days were injected intravenously with 1.7 3 108 51crlabeled cells. samples of blood were obtained 5, 15, 30,
60, 90, and 120 min after injection and cell-associated
radioactivity was measured in a g-counter (gamma
8000, beckman instruments, inc., fullerton, ca).
studies were also performed with heat-altered erythrocytes to investigate splenic trapping mediated by
nonimmune mechanisms (3, 4, 8, 9). clearance curves
were plotted by expressing the number of blood counts
per minute at each time point as a percentage of the
number of counts per minute at 5 min. clearance at
time 60, 90, and 120 min was analyzed to calculate a p
value for the difference between control and experimental clearance curves using student’s t test. in addition, for each day’s clearance study, the percentage
inhibition of clearance (mean 6 sem) above control
was calculated at 90 and 120 min according to the
formula
percentage inhibition
5 100 3 @1 2 ~cpmc 2 cpmx !/~cpmc 2 cpmea !#,
where cpmc refers to counts per minute for the untreated control animal injected with unsensitized cells,

cpmx to the experimental animal treated with dopaminergic drugs and injected with igg-coated erythrocytes,
and cpmea to control animals treated with pbs only (no
dopaminergic drug) and injected with the control iggsensitized erythrocytes. a negative value for percentage
inhibition indicates enhancement of clearance. this formula compares treated animals with the control animals
studied on the same experimental day and expresses the
data as percentage alteration of clearance, where 100%
inhibition of clearance by dopaminergic drugs corresponds to the situation in which the clearance of iggsensitized erythrocytes (cpmx) is identical to that of unsensitized erythrocytes (cpmc) (8, 9).
binding of igg-coated erythrocytes by splenic macrophages in vitro. guinea pigs were sacrificed, splenectomy was performed immediately, and the spleens
were placed in rpmi 1640 1 10% heat-inactivated
fetal calf serum 1 glutamine (complete rpmi). fine
suspensions of spleen cells in pbs with no  xxxg289xxx  or
mg11 were obtained using tissue grinding sieves with
a 100-mm mesh, followed by nytex gauze sieving (50
mm, tetko inc., elmsford, ny). the cells were then
layered onto a discontinous percoll (pharmacia, inc.,
barcelona, spain) gradient (35–70%) and spun at 600g
and 22°c for 30 min. mononuclear cells were recovered
from the intermediate layer (45–55% percoll). the cells
were then washed at room temperature with pbs containing 5mm edta 1 10% heat-inactivated fcs previously dialyzed with pbs without  xxxg289xxx  or mg11 and
resuspended to 2 3 106 cells/ml in complete rpmi.
cells were incubated for 60 min at 37°c in a 5% co2
atmosphere in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks to allow the
macrophages to adhere. nonadherent cells were removed with complete rpmi, and adherent cells were
mechanically dislodged after 10 min of incubation at
37°c in a 5% co2 atmosphere with pbs containing 5
mm edta 1 10% dialyzed heat-inactivated fcs. cells
were washed once and resuspended in complete rpmi.
more than 95% of the resultant cells were viable mononuclear cells as determined by their ability to exclude
trypan blue, and .90% of cells ingested latex beads
and were stained with nonspecific sterase. monolayers
of adherent cells were prepared as previously described
by incubating 1 3 106 cells on a glass coverslip in a
35-mm plastic petri dish at 37°c for 45 min under 5%
co2. more than 95% of the cells were adherent to glass
(8, 9). for experiments using fcg receptor activity in
vitro, guinea pig erythrocytes were sensitized with 500
molecules of igg per erythrocyte as described above,
and 1 ml of erythrocytes (5 3 107 cells/ml) was incubated with the macrophage monolayers at 37°c under
5% co2 for 20 min. the monolayers were washed,
air-dried, and stained with wright–giemsa, and 200
consecutive macrophages were inspected under oil im-

mersion for the number of erythrocytes bound per cells
(8, 9). the number of macrophages which bound more
than three erythrocytes was then determined. no internalization of erythrocytes was observed under the
above experimental conditions. treatment with dopaminergic drugs had no effect on the yield or viability of
mononuclear cells isolated from the spleen.
flow cytometry. monoclonal antibodies with specificity against guinea pig macrophage fcgr1,2 (via2
igg1) and fcgr2 (viia1 igg1) (24) were utilized in
indirect immunofluorescence binding studies to assess
fcg receptor cell surface expression. these monoclonal
antibodies were the generous gift of drs. yamashita
and nakamura, sapporo, japan. cells (5 3 105) were
incubated with saturating concentrations of each
monoclonal antibody for 60 min at 4°c and washed
twice with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) containing
0.5% bovine  xxxg124xxx  and 0.02% sodium azide.
to measure bound antibody, a fitc-labeled goat antimouse antibody (tago, inc., burlingame, ca) was
added for 30 min at 4°c. the cells were again washed
twice and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. cellassociated fluorescence was measured using a facscan cytometer with consort-32 software (becton–
dickinson, madrid, spain). for all samples 10,000
events were recorded on a logarithmic fluorescence
scale, and the actual mean fluorescence intensity (mfi)
for each sample was determined using the consort-32
software. in order to correct for autofluorescence, the
mfi of a nonreactive murine igg1 antibody (m3) was
subtracted from the mfi of the anti-fcgr1,2- and antifcgr2-stained cells. percentage of change in fluorescence intensity was calculated by
% change 5 @~mfi of anti- xxxg772xxx -treated cells

~mfi of anti- xxxg772xxx -untreated cells
2 mfi of m3-untreated cells)] 21 3 100.
to demonstrate the specificity of dopaminergic drugs
on macrophage fcg receptors expression, we included
an additional control with an irrelevant guinea pig
pan-macrophage surface antigen, gpb (seralab ltd.,
sussex, england). treatment with dopaminergic drugs
did not influence the cell surface expression of this
pan-macrophage antigen while altering the expression
of both macrophage fcg receptors, fcgr1,2 and fcgr2.

cytometry experiments. cells were incubated at either
0 or 37°c for 20 min, washed, fixed in paraformaldehyde, and spun onto microscope slides in a centrifuge.

different doses of dopaminergic drugs as described
above. serum samples were taken at baseline and each
day 2 h after the injection of dopaminergic drugs or
pbs (sham) and were frozen at 280°c in 200-ml aliquots until prolactin levels were determined by elisa
(atom, madrid, spain).
results

macrophage fcg receptors are critical in host defense and the pathologic process of immune disorders
(1–10). the pharmacologic modulation of macrophage
fcg receptors expression opens the possibility of preventing infections and treating immune mediated conditions. dopaminergic drugs alter immune functions
and are sometimes associated with overt clinical manifestations (11–21). we studied the function of splenic
macrophage fcg receptors in guinea pigs treated with
dopaminergic agents by assessing the clearance of iggsensitized erythrocytes in vivo (fig. 1), the in vitro
binding of igg-sensitized erythrocytes by isolated
splenic macrophages (fig. 2 and table 1), and the cell
surface expression of both guinea pig macrophage fcg
receptor classes, fcgr1,2 and fcgr2, using flow cytometry with specific monoclonal antibodies (table 2).
sham-treated animals cleared 50 6 3% of the iggsensitized erythrocytes at 120 min (fig. 1). nonimmune erythrocyte clearance (i.e., not fcg receptors dependent) was determined by examining the survival of
heat-damaged erythrocytes not coated with igg. more
than 95% of the heat-damaged erythrocytes were
cleared, while 97 6 3% of the unsensitized rbcs were
still circulating at 120 min (fig. 1) for either shams or
animals treated with dopaminergic drugs. treatment
with dopa-agonists: b, l, p significantly enhanced the
clearance of igg-sensitized erythrocytes in more than
88% of the animals (fig. 1). clearance curves in ani-

note. splenic macrophages were isolated from animals treated for
7 days with dopaminergic drugs at the indicated dose. the percent
splenic macrophage binding more than three igg-sensitized rbcs
(x 6 sem) over sham controls is indicated as an index of in vitro
macrophage fcg receptors function. p , 0.001, unless indicated
otherwise (*p , 0.01, †p , 0.05).

mals treated with b, l, and p at high (fig. 1a) and low
doses (fig. 1b) are shown. the percentage of iggsensitized rbcs remaining in circulation after 120 min
in animals treated with b, l, and p is indicated. no
consistent enhancement of clearance of igg-sensitized

erythrocytes was observed at doses of b, l, and p below
those indicated in fig. 1b.
to assess the effect of dopa-antagonists on macrophage fcg receptor function, we chose a mixed d1/d2
dopa-antagonist, clp, a  xxxg655xxx  antagonist, sch
23390, and five  xxxg656xxx  antagonists, m, s, v, a,
and  xxxd1708xxx  cs. treatment with clp, m, s, v, a, or cs
(fig. 1) significantly impaired the clearance of iggsensitized erythrocytes in more than 85% of the animals. the lowest effective dose of dopa-antagonists
impairing the clearance of igg-sensitized cells is indicated in fig. 1b.
fcg receptor function was determined in vitro by the
percentage of isolated macrophage binding more than
three igg-sensitized erythrocytes (fig. 2 and table 1).
the percentage of splenic macrophage isolated from animals treated with dopa-agonists b, l, or p binding more
than three igg-sensitized erythrocytes was significantly
higher than that of macrophages from sham controls,
44 6 2%, and vice versa, splenic macrophages isolated
from animals treated with dopa-antagonists clp, m, s, v,
a, and cs bound significantly less igg-sensitized erythrocytes than those from sham controls (fig. 2 and table
1). no consistent alteration of binding of igg-sensitized
erythrocytes was observed with doses of dopaminergic
agents under those indicated in table 1.
we further studied the effect of treatment with dopaminergic agents on the splenic macrophage fcg receptors cell surface expression using flow cytometry
with specific monoclonal antibodies against those receptors (table 2). guinea pig macrophages express two
types of fcg receptors, fcgr1,2 and fcgr2 (24). treatment with dopa-agonists b, l, or p increased the expression of both splenic macrophage fcg receptor
classes, fcgr1,2 and fcgr2, whereas dopa-antagonists
decreased fc g receptors expression. macrophage
fcgr1,2 was more sensitive to dopaminergic modulatory signals than the other macrophage fcg receptor,
fcgr2. the lowest effective dose of dopaminergic drugs
altering fcg receptors expression is indicated in table
2. immunofluorescence capping experiments were performed in order to examine any possible effects of in
vivo administered dopaminergic drugs on the membrane mobility of fcgr1,2 and fcgr2. we consider
whether the lipophilic dopaminergic drugs might alter
the mobility of surface membrane receptors, thus contributing to the observed effects on fcgr1,2 and fcgr2
expression. to this end in vitro capping experiments
were performed comparing splenic macrophages isolated from treated animals to those from sham controls.  xxxd372xxx  (0.025 and 0.250 mg/kg), chlorpromazine (1, 5, and 25 mg/kg), veralipride (5, 25, and
50 mg/kg), and sch 23390 (5 and 25 mg/kg), which
were found to be the most potent agents in studies
described above, were chosen. cells incubated at 0°c to

note. splenic macrophages were isolated from animals treated for
7 days with the indicated daily doses of dopaminergic drugs and the
cell surface expression of both splenic macrophage fcg receptor
classes, fcgr1,2 and fcgr2, was studied by flow cytometry with
monoclonal antibodies. results are expressed as percent alteration
(x 6 sem) of the mean fluorescence intensity compared to that of
sham controls. positive values indicate enhanced cell surface expression, while negative values represent inhibition of cell surface expression. p , 0.001, unless indicated otherwise (*p , 0.01, †p ,

that reported for the ligand-induced capping of lymphocyte surface immunoglobulin (34). no significant

chlorpromazine has a predominant d1 and d2 dopaantagonist action, while benzamides ( xxxd2624xxx , sulpiride, veralipride,  xxxd115xxx , and  xxxd1708xxx ) have a more selective d2 dopa-antagonist effect
(27–32). a selective d1 dopa-antagonist would help to
differentiate the relative contribution of d1 and d2
dopa-antagonists action on the expression of macrophage fcg receptors. we used the selective d1 dopaantagonist, sch 23390, to assess the contribution of
dopamine receptors d1 and d2 on the observed alterations of macrophage fcg receptors expression. in doing so, animals were treated with chlorpromazine
(mixed d1/d2-antagonist), sch 23390 (d1-antagonist), veralipride (d2-antagonist), or sch 23390 plus
veralipride (d1 1 d2 dopa-antagonists). treatment
with chlorpromazine, sch 23390, or veralipride significantly decreased the clearance of igg-sensitized
erythrocytes (fig. 3a). a d1-antagonist, sch 2390,
significantly decreased the clearance of igg-sensitized
erythrocytes; at 120 min 60 6 2% of the igg-sensitized
erythrocytes remained in the circulation in 25 mg/kg
treated animals compared to 50 6 3% for sham controls
(p , 0.001). nevertheless, the inhibition of the clearance of igg-sensitized erythrocytes by sch 23390 (d1antagonist) is not as intense as that induced by veralipride (d2-antagonist) or chlorpromazine (d1/d2
antagonist).
treatment with a d1-antagonist, sch 23390 (25
mg/kg), plus a d2-antagonist, veralipride (50 mg/kg),
does not significantly decrease the clearance of iggsensitized erythrocytes, compared with either v (50
mg/kg), clp (50 mg/kg), or sch 23390 (25 mg/kg). a
specific d1-antagonist (sch 23390) does not further
decrease the clearance of igg-sensitized erythrocytes
induced by d2 dopa receptor-antagonists. therefore,
dopa-antagonists impaire the clearance of igg-sensitized erythrocytes through a main effect at d2 dopa
receptor level. these findings were confirmed by the in
vitro binding of igg-sensitized erythrocytes and the
cell surface expression of both guinea pig fcg receptors
by splenic macrophages isolated from animals treated
with dopa-antagonists (fig. 3b). treatment with chlorpromazine, veralipride, or sch 23390 significantly decreased the percentage of macrophages binding more
than three igg-sensitized erythrocytes. the lowest effective dose inhibiting the binding of igg-sensitized

erythrocytes by isolated splenic macrophages was 1
mg/kg for clp, v, or sch 23390. the administration of
both v and sch 23390 significantly impaired the in
vitro binding of igg-sensitized erythrocytes by splenic
macrophages when compared to sham controls or animals treated with either sch 23390 or v. nevertheless, the administration of sch 23390 (d1 antagonist)
plus v (d2 antagonist) did not significantly impair the
binding of igg-sensitized erythrocytes when compared
to that of the animals treated with clp (a mixed d1/d2
dopa-antagonist).
flow cytometry with specific monoclonal antibodies
(fig. 3c) demonstrated a significant inhibition of the
splenic macrophage fcgr1,2 cell surface expression by
64 6 3% for clp at 25 mg/kg (p , 0.001), 54 6 2% for
v at 50 mg/kg (p , 0.001), 18 6 1% for sch 23390 at
25 mg/kg (p , 0.01), and 65 6 3% for v at 50 mg/kg
plus sch 23390 at 25 mg/kg (p , 0.001). the expression of the other macrophage fcg receptor, fcgr2, was
also inhibited by 56 6 3% for clp at 25 mg/kg (p ,
0.001), 45 6 2% for v at 50 mg/kg (p , 0.001), 7 6 1%
for sch 23390 at 25 mg/kg (p , 0.05), and 56 6 3% for

v at 50 mg/kg plus sch 23390 at 25 mg/kg (p , 0.001).
these findings indicate that both d2 dopa-antagonists
(v) and d1 dopa-antagonists (sch 23390) inhibit the
expression of macrophage fcg receptors. however, the
inhibitory effect of d2 dopa-antagonists on macrophage fcg receptors expression is significantly more
intense than that of d1 dopa-antagonists.
the above results taken together demonstrate that
dopa-antagonists impair the expression of both guinea
pig macrophage fcg receptors. this dopa-antagonist
effect is mainly due to a d2 dopa-receptor-dependent
action. dopa-antagonists with a mixed d1/d2 dopareceptor activity, like chlorpromazine, impair macrophage fcg receptors function and cell surface expression more effectively than selective d1 or d2 dopaantagonists. we have not assessed the participation of
other dopamine receptors classes on the observed dopaminergic regulation of macrophage fcg receptors expression.
dopa-agonists decrease and, vice versa dopa-antagonists increase, the plasma levels of prl (10, 11, 31–
35). therefore, the effects of dopaminergic agents on

dopaminergic drugs alter fcg receptor expression

gomez et al.

macrophage fcg receptors expression may in part be
due to altered prl levels. serum prl was significantly
decreased in animals treated with dopa-agonists and,
vice versa, was elevated in animals treated with dopaantagonists (data not shown). however, we did not find
any correlation between prl levels and the alteration
of macrophage fcg receptors expression induced by
treatment with dopaminergic drugs.
we report that treatment for 7 days with dopaminergic agents alters the fcg receptor mediated clearance
of igg-coated cells through an effect at the splenic
macrophage fcg receptors expression. dopa-agonists
increased macrophage fc g receptors expression,
whereas dopa-antagonists impaired macrophage fcg
receptors expression. fcgr1,2 is more affected by dopaminergic drugs than the other fcg receptor class,
fcgr2. this dopaminergic effect is mediated by both
d1 and d2 dopamine receptors, with a more major role
for d2 than for d1 receptors.
discussion

macrophage fcg receptors have a critical role in host
defense and the pathophysiology of immune mediated
disorders. impaired splenic macrophage fcg receptor
clearance predisposes end-stage renal disease and cirrhotic patients to severe bacterial infections (1, 2). defective splenic macrophage fcg receptors expression
(35– 40) and circulating anti-fcg receptors antibodies
occur in several autoimmune diseases (41). the blockade or down-regulation of splenic macrophage fcg receptors expression is one of the mechanisms by which
immune cytopenias improve (5–10, 42– 45). the pharmacologic regulation of macrophage fcg receptors expression is a potential therapeutic intervention for immune mediated disorders. dopaminergic drugs have
important immunoregulatory functions (11–21, 28).
we examined one aspect of the pathologic process in
autoimmune disorders, namely macrophage clearance
of igg-sensitized cells in the spleen, using an experimental model developed in the guinea pig, which has
proved helpful in studying the effects of glucocorticoids
and sex hormones in these conditions (3, 4, 8, 9). in
doing so, we chose three dopa-agonists,  xxxd372xxx ,
leuprolide, and pergolide, and six dopa-antagonists,
chlorpromazine,  xxxd2624xxx , sulpiride, veralipride,  xxxd115xxx , and  xxxd1708xxx .  xxxd372xxx  is a
dopa-agonist drug used in the treatment of movement
disorders and to interrupt lactation by its inhibitory
effects on prolactin secretion (25). leuprolide (26) and
pergolide (27) are synthetic dopa-agonists employed in
the treatment of human conditions, mainly parkinson’s disease and prostate cancer. chlorpromazine is a
dopa-antagonist of the phenothiazine family that has
been widely employed as a neuroleptic drug (28). m, s,

v, a, and cs are dopa-antagonists of the benzamide
family.  xxxd2624xxx  has been widely used in the
symptomatic treatment of digestive disorders (29).
sulpiride has been mainly prescribed for the treatment
of minor psychiatric disorders (30). veralipride has
been employed in the symptomatic treatment of the
postmenopausal syndrome with few side effects (31).
 xxxd115xxx  has been used in the symptomatic therapy
of human digestive disorders (32).  xxxd1708xxx  is a new
synthetic dopa-antagonist of the benzamide family,
with selective d2 dopa receptor peripheral actions that
are employed for the relief of nausea, vomiting, and
gastroesophageal reflux (33).
treatment for 7 days with dopaminergic agents altered the clearance of igg-coated cells in vivo, the in
vitro of igg-sensitized rbcs by isolated splenic macrophages, and the cell surface expression of macrophage fcg receptors. two fcg receptor classes, fcgr2
and fcgr1,2, have been identified in guinea pig macrophages (24). our data suggest that these receptors
are also expressed on essentially all splenic macrophages. furthermore, when macrophages from the
spleen are isolated, each of these fcg receptors participates in the binding of igg-sensitized erythrocytes (9).
dopa-agonists increased the clearance of igg-sensitized cells and enhanced the expression of both splenic
macrophage fcg receptors, fcgr1,2 and fcgr2, while
dopa-antagonists decreased splenic macrophage fcg
receptors expression in vivo and in vitro. fcgr1,2 was
significantly more sensitive to modulation by dopaminergic agents than fcgr2. pergolide was the most effective dopa-agonist, while chlorpromazine was the
most effective dopa-antagonist.
chlorpromazine is a neuroleptic drug of the phenothiazine family, with high proautoimmune potential.
it causes autoimmune disorders with a preponderant
humoral component, namely a drug-related lupus (13,
14), immune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and frequent asymptomatic development
of antinuclear antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies,
lupus anticoagulants, and increased serum levels of
igm (13, 15–18). our findings of reduced macrophage
fcg receptors function by dopa-antagonists treatment
are in agreement with the suppressive effects of chlorpromazine on the cellular component of the immune
response (19, 20, 46 –50). clp is a nonspecific dopamine
antagonist which binds to all kinds of dopamine receptors (d1–d5), as well as to receptors for histamine and
5-hydroxytryptamine. human lymphocytes and monocytes express dopamine receptors (51, 52). it is not
known whether guinea pig splenic macrophages express dopamine receptors and, if so, of what specificity
(d1 to d5). the multiple receptor mediated as well as
nospecific effects of clp make it particularly difficult to
identify the molecular target(s) involved in clp effects

dopaminergic drugs alter fcg receptor expression

on the immune system. it has been shown that the
immunomodulatory effects of functional clp analogues
diminish when their specificity for d2 receptors augments (19, 50). our data indicate that the dopaminergic alteration of macrophage fcg receptors function is a
d1 and d2 dopamine receptor mediated effect, with a
major d2 dopamine receptor participation.
dopaminergic drugs alter endocrine function. prolactin secretion is under dopaminergic control. dopaagonists decrease prl levels, while dopa-antagonists
induce hyperprolactinemia (53–57). chronic hypo- or
hyperprolactinemia is associated with humoral and
cellular immune alterations that normalize with the
restoration of normal prl levels (11). prolactin abnormalities have been described in a number of immunologic disorders, including sle (11, 19), autoimmune
uveitis, and thyroid disease (11, 12, 58, 59). these
autoimmune disorders have been associated with an
altered function of macrophage fcg receptors (35– 40,
60 – 62), as well as with the presence of anti-fcg receptors autoantibodies (41, 63). treatment with dopaagonists was associated with hypoprolactinemia and,
vice versa, dopa-antagonists induced hyperprolactinemia. nevertheless, prl levels did not correlate with
macrophage fcg receptors alteration.
our results indicate that: (1) treatment with dopaagonists  xxxd372xxx , leuprolide, and pergolide enhances the clearance of igg-sensitized cells while dopaantagonists chlorpromazine,  xxxd2624xxx , sulpiride,
veralipride,  xxxd115xxx , and  xxxd1708xxx  impair the clearance of igg-sensitized cells by an effect on splenic
macrophage fcg receptors expression, (2) guinea pig
macrophage receptor fcgr1,2 is more responsive to
alteration by treatment with dopaminergic drugs than
is the other macrophage fcg receptor, fcgr2, (3) the
dopaminergic effects on macrophage fcg receptors expression are a mixed d1 and d2 dopamine-receptordependent action, with a major participation of d2
dopamine receptors and much less of d1 receptors.
these effects can be achieved with doses of dopaminergic drugs close to those previously used for the treatment of human conditions. changes of plasma prolactin levels induced by treatment with dopa-agonists or
dopa-antagonists did not correlate with alterations of
macrophage fcg receptors expression. studies using
nondopaminergic modulators of prolactin levels would
help clarify the role of prolactin on macrophage fcg
receptors expression. the potential implications of dopaminergic modulation of splenic macrophage fcg receptors expression will await clinical confirmation.
