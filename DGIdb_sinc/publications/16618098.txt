abstract: cobalamin-independent  xxxg1479xxx  (mete) catalyzes the final step of de novo
methionine synthesis using the triglutamate derivative of methyltetrahydrofolate (ch3-h4pteglu3) as methyl
donor and homocysteine (hcy) as methyl acceptor. this reaction is challenging because at physiological
ph the hcy thiol is not a strong nucleophile and ch3-h4pteglu3 provides a very poor leaving group. our
laboratory has previously established that hcy is ligated to a tightly bound zinc ion in the mete active
site. this interaction activates hcy by lowering its pka, such that the thiolate is stabilized at neutral ph.
the remaining chemical challenge is the activation of ch3-h4pteglu3. protonation of n5 of ch3-h4pteglu3 would produce a better leaving group, but occurs with a pka of 5 in solution. we have taken
advantage of the sensitivity of the ch3-h4pteglu3 absorption spectrum to probe its protonation state when
bound to mete. comparison of free and mete-bound ch3-h4pteglu3 absorbance spectra indicated that
the n5 is not protonated in the binary complex. rapid reaction studies have revealed changes in ch3h4pteglu3 absorbance that are consistent with protonation at n5. these absorbance changes show saturable
dependence on both hcy and ch3-h4pteglu3, indicating that protonation of ch3-h4pteglu3 occurs upon
formation of the ternary complex and prior to methyl transfer. furthermore, the tetrahydrofolate (h4pteglu3) product appears to remain bound to mete, and in the presence of excess hcy a mete‚h4pteglu3‚
hcy mixed ternary complex forms, in which h4pteglu3 is protonated.

i find the reaction catalyzed by cobalamin-dependent
 xxxg1479xxx  improbable, and that catalyzed
by cobalamin-independent  xxxg1479xxx  impossible.

methionine synthases catalyze the transfer of a methyl
group from n5 of methyltetrahydrofolate (ch3-h4folate),1
a tertiary amine, to the delta-sulfur of homocysteine (hcy) to
form methionine and tetrahydrofolate (h4folate). tertiary
amines are rarely used as methyl donors in biology, because
the methyl group is only sluggishly reactive when compared
to that of the sulfonium  xxxd3156xxx  ( xxxd3156xxx ),
which is the usual biological methyl donor. in cobalamindependent  xxxg1479xxx  (meth), the “improbable”
enzyme, the methyl group is removed from ch3-h4folate

by attack of the supernucleophilic  xxxd1771xxx  cofactor and
then transferred from the methylcobalamin cofactor to hcy.
however, cobalamin-independent  xxxg1479xxx  (mete)
lacks any organic cofactor, and the nucleophile is hcy itself.
hcy has a microscopic pka for the thiol of 10 (1), so in
solution at neutral ph it is present as the thiol rather than
the more reactive thiolate (2-4). we have hypothesized that
the strategy to improve the concentration of reactive species
would be to shift the pka values of the two substrates upon
binding to mete. if the pka of hcy were lowered and that
of ch3-h4folate were simultaneously raised on binding to
mete, both substrates would be activated for reaction at
neutral ph (figure 1). furthermore, this strategy would avoid
proton transfer between the substrates in the ternary complex.
prior studies have established that hcy is activated by both
mete and meth using similar strategies. in both cases, the
hcy is coordinated to a zinc ion at the active site of the enzyme (5, 6). in meth, uv-visible absorbance measurements
have established that hcy binds as a thiolate, with a pka
that lies at or below 6 (7). thus the role of zinc, which is
required for the activity of both enzymes, is to act as a lewis
acid and decrease the pka of hcy on the enzyme. the pka
of hcy when bound to zinc in mete has not been determined.
however, consistent with the hypothesis that zinc serves as
a lewis acid, nearly one proton per protein is released upon
binding of hcy to mete, measured in the presence of a ph
indicator at an initial ph of 7.8, suggesting that the pka of
hcy is indeed considerably lower than 10 (7, 8).
mete and meth have no detectable sequence similarity,
and the nature and spacing of the protein residues that bind

activation of methyltetrahydrofolate by mete

figure 1: a strategy for catalysis by mete. the pka for the n5 of
ch3-h4folate is 5 in solution (blue solid line); the microscopic pka
for deprotonation of the hcy thiol in solution is 10 (red solid line).
shifting the substrate pka values to 8 and 6 (blue and red dotted
lines, respectively) would greatly increase the overlap between
activated substrates.

the zinc differ. mete arose from gene duplication and has
two homologous domains that both fold into (r/beta)8 barrels
(9). the barrels are oriented face-to-face such that the
c-termini of the barrel strands point toward each other. zinc
is bound in the c-terminal domain of mete and is coordinated by protein residues cys643, cys726, his641 (8), and
glu665 (e. coli numbering) (9). when hcy binds to mete,
it coordinates the zinc, causing the metal to move away from
glu665 and toward hcy (9). even though the zinc/hcy
domains of mete and meth have no sequence similarity,
they are both (r/beta)8 barrels with strong structural similarity
(9). however, meth has a unique set of zinc ligands: three
cysteines and an n/o ligand, presumably a water (10). when
hcy coordinates the zinc, the latter ligand is displaced.
the binding of ch3-h4folate to mete and meth also is
very different. meth can bind both the monoglutamate and
polyglutamate forms of ch3-h4folate, and both can serve
as efficient methyl donors (11). in contrast, mete shows an
absolute requirement for a polyglutamate derivative (11, 12).
typically, the substrate used is methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate (ch3-h4pteglu3), which is the predominant form
in escherichia coli (13). a structure of thermotoga maritima
mete shows that ch3-h4pteglu3 binds between the n- and
c-terminal barrels and interacts with a number of conserved
residues from both domains (9). the n5-methyl points away
from the zinc site and is clearly too distant for methyl
transfer. these data indicate that the ch3-h4pteglu3 binary
complex is not poised for catalysis and must assume a
different conformation for direct methyl transfer to occur.
indeed, a structure of mete from arabidopsis thaliana was
solved with pteglu5 and methionine bound. in this structure
the pterin ring is flipped, such that the n5 is pointing toward
the methyl group of methionine (14). such a rotation about
the c6-c9 and c9-n10 dihedrals represents one type of
conformational change that may take place to allow methyl
transfer. it should be noted, however, that the electron density
for the pterin is poor in this structure and the ring geometry
of pteglu5 is different from that of reduced folates, which
may not be able to adopt this particular conformation.
the pka for n5 of ch3-h4pteglu3 is not perturbed upon
binding to mete in a binary complex (7). the uv-visible

biochemistry, vol. 45, no. 16, 2006 5093
absorbance of ch3-h4folate changes considerably with ph
(15) and hydrophobicity (16), providing an easily observable
signal of the protonation state and environment (figure 2).
the very high protein absorbance limits absorbance measurements to wavelengths above ∼307 nm (vertical red line
in figure 2a). this region of the spectrum of the protonated
and unprotonated species does not dramatically change shape
and differs largely in the magnitude of the extinction
coefficients. however, these species can be distinguished on
the basis of their characteristic difference spectra. for
instance, when the spectrum of ch3-h4folate at ph 7 is
subtracted from that of ch3-h4folate at ph 3, the positive
difference absorbance below 270-280 nm and negative
difference absorbance above 270-280 nm is characteristic
of ch3-h4folate protonation (figure 2a). the difference
spectrum associated with binding of ch3-h4pteglu3 to mete
does not resemble the difference spectrum for protonation
of ch3-h4folate in solution (figure 2b) (7). instead, the
difference spectrum associated with formation of the mete‚
ch3-h4pteglu3 binary complex is very similar to that for
introducing aqueous ch3-h4pteglu3 into 80% acetonitrile
at neutral ph, suggesting that the ch3-h4pteglu3 is transferred to a hydrophobic environment on binding to the
protein. additionally, the kd for binding of the ch3-h4pteglu3 is invariant between ph 5.5 and ph 8.5, indicating
that binary complex formation does not involve either proton
uptake or release (7).
the spectral changes seen when ch3-h4folate binds meth
are similar to those seen on its binding to mete, indicating
that the environment is hydrophobic and that the ch3-h4folate n5 is not protonated in the meth binary complex
(16). in meth, ch3-h4folate binds in an (r/beta)8 barrel which
forms a separate domain of the protein (17). ph-rate profiles of meth enzyme activity suggest that protonation occurs
only in a ternary complex of enzyme, ch3-h4folate, and
 xxxd1771xxx  (7), in which the cobalamin-binding module
of meth is positioned vis-à-vis the folate-binding barrel.
these experiments measured the rate of methyl transfer to
exogenous  xxxd1771xxx  from ch3-h4folate bound to a
fragment of meth containing only the folate- and hcybinding barrels. this reaction exhibits theorell-chance
kinetics, in which the ternary complex does not accumulate,
so that absorbance measurements of this ternary complex
are not possible.
in this contribution, we have taken advantage of the
sensitivity of the uv-visible spectra of reduced folates to
protonation at n5 and the lack of protein and hcy absorbance
above ∼300 nm to monitor the chemical state of the substrate
during catalysis. this study of ch3-h4pteglu3 activation is
unique because mete is the only ch3-h4folate-dependent
enzyme that does not catalyze methyl transfer to a corrinoid
or cobalamin cofactor, both of which absorb strongly in the
uv and visible ranges.
here we present evidence that ch3-h4pteglu3 is activated
for methyl transfer by protonation of n5 and that the
protonation of ch3-h4pteglu3 requires formation of a ternary
complex with both substrates bound to mete. we provide
kinetic evidence that this protonation occurs before methyl
transfer. we further demonstrate that the product h4pteglu3
can also bind mete in a complex with hcy and is protonated
in this mixed product/substrate ternary complex.

reagents. dithiothreitol was purchased from bio-rad
(hercules, ca). (6s)-ch3-h4pteglu1 and (6s)-h4pteglu1
were a gift from eprova (schaffhausen, switzerland). potassium phosphate and other buffer components were purchased
from fisher scientific (fair lawn, nj). protocatechuic acid
dioxygenase (pcd) was a generous gift from david p.
ballou. hcy thiolactone and all other materials were obtained
from sigma (st. louis, mo). see the accompanying paper
(35) for expression and purification of mete, as well as the
synthesis of (6s)-ch3-h4pteglu3 and hcy.
absorbance spectra of free folate species. spectra of
folates in solution were obtained using either an hp 845x
diode array or a cary 50 bio uv-visible spectrophotometer.
spectra of ch3-h4pteglu1 in amt buffer with and without
80% acetonitrile were obtained previously (7, 16). stocks
(∼1 mm) of h4pteglu1 were made fresh on the day of use
in water with 10 mm dithiothreitol, and aliquots from the
stock were diluted (100-fold) into various buffers to obtain
spectra. all buffers were bubbled with oxygen-scrubbed argon for at least 10 min. the spectrum of h4pteglu1 in aqueous solution was obtained as previously described (15) in
70 mm sodium formate, 70 mm sodium acetate, and 70 mm
potassium phosphate buffer, brought to either ph 7.2 or ph
3.0 with hydrochloric acid and approximately 1 m ionic
strength with  xxxd3213xxx . the spectrum of protonated
h4pteglu1 in a hydrophobic solution was obtained in 80%
acetonitrile and 20% water, brought to ph 3.0 with phosphoric acid.
stopped-flow measurements. rapid reaction studies were
carried out in a hi-tech scientific model sf-61dx2 stoppedflow spectrophotometer (tgk scientific ltd., bradford on
avon, wiltshire, u.k.) in single mixing mode, using a
deuterium light source for single wavelength detection or a
tungsten light source for diode array detection. all stoppedflow experiments were performed under anaerobic conditions. the instrument was flushed with 100 mm potassium
phosphate, ph 7.2, containing ∼0.1 unit/ml protocatechuate
dioxygenase (pcd) and 1 mm protocatechuate [pca (3,4dihydroxybenzoate)] and allowed to stand overnight (18).
pca and pcd were flushed from the system with mete
assay buffer (50 mm tris, 10 mm potassium phosphate, ph
7.2, 100 µm  xxxd2534xxx , 1 mm dithiothreitol), which had been
bubbled for at least 10 min with oxygen-free argon. enzyme
and substrate solutions were made anaerobic in glass
tonometers by cycling quickly between vacuum and oxygenscrubbed argon five times, followed by 5 min of equilibration
with argon at room temperature; this procedure was repeated
ten times. all measurements were performed at 25 °c in
mete assay buffer.
apparent rate constants were calculated from exponential
fits of single wavelength absorbance traces in kaleidagraph

spectra of intermediates were calculated from global fits
of diode array data using specfit/32, version 3.0 (spectrum
software associates, claix, france). the refined rate constants and amplitudes from the fit were used to calculate the
spectrum of each reaction intermediate (at 100%) in specfit.
the spectrum of each intermediate was determined as an
average from multiple shots taken under the same conditions,
unless noted.
e‚h4pteglu3 spectral titrations. all spectra were obtained
using an hp 845x diode array spectrophotometer. a solution
of mete and ch3-h4pteglu3 in mete assay buffer was made
anaerobic via a side port in a closed cuvette by the method
described above for stopped-flow tonometers. a solution of
10 mm hcy was bubbled with oxygen-free argon for at least
20 min. one equivalent of hcy was introduced through a
ptfe/silicone septum (fisher scientific), held by a screw
cap at the top of the cuvette, into the solution containing
mete and ch3-h4pteglu3 using a 100 µl hamilton syringe
equipped with an aliquoter (2 µl/aliquot). the reaction was
allowed to proceed to completion (as determined by constant
absorption spectra) after which the rest of the hcy was added
in 2-6 µl aliquots and a spectrum was obtained after each
addition.
results
observation of a pre-steady-state ternary mete‚ch3h4pteglu3‚hcy complex in which ch3-h4pteglu3 is protonated. a binary complex of mete and ch3-h4pteglu3 was
mixed with free hcy, resulting in a rapid decrease in absorbance at 324 nm, followed by a rise (figure 3a). the initial
decrease in absorbance observed in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer under single turnover conditions (equimolar
enzyme and substrates or limiting substrate) fit best to two
phases. the spectra associated with each phase were monitored in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer with a diode array
detector (figure 4a). to better distinguish the spectral changes
that occur during the reaction, the first spectrum (taken at 3
ms) was subtracted from all subsequent spectra. the difference spectra associated with the first two phases bear a strong
resemblance to the difference spectrum of ch3-h4pteglu3
protonated in a hydrophobic environment (figure 2a) minus
unprotonated ch3-h4pteglu3 bound in the mete binary
complex (figure 2b). since the mete‚ch3-h4pteglu3 binary
complex is formed before the reaction begins, its spectrum
was used as the initial spectrum to construct this model
difference spectrum for protonation (dotted line in figure
4), as opposed to the difference spectrum for protonation
shown in figure 2a, in which the spectrum of free unprotonated ch3-h4folate was subtracted from that of protonated
ch3-h4folate in 80% acetonitrile. the difference spectra
obtained in the first 220 ms of the mete reaction appear to
be red shifted by ∼3 nm with respect to the difference spectrum of protonated ch3-h4pteglu3 in 80% acetonitrile at ph
3. these observations may reflect the difference in dielectric
constant between 80% acetonitrile and the active site of mete.
the total amplitude of the absorbance change appears to be

smaller in the diode array than in experiments performed at
a single wavelength due to a longer dead time (2.99 ms) in
the diode array setup than the photomultiplier setup used
for single wavelength measurements (1.5 ms dead time).
when the order of the reaction was switched and the same
concentration of the mete‚hcy binary complex was reacted
with ch3-h4pteglu3, the absorbance changes were very
similar (figure 3b). two phases of decreasing absorbance
were followed by an increase in absorbance at 324 nm. the
difference spectra from the first two phases have the same
shape as those obtained from the reaction in which substrates
were added in the opposite order (figure 4b). however, the
rate constant for the first phase is faster when the reaction
is initiated by adding ch3-h4pteglu3, so that the apparent
absorbance change reaches its minimum faster (120 ms) and
is smaller because more of the decrease is missed in the
instrument dead time.
the amplitudes of the absorbance decrease in each of
the two fast phases were dependent on ch3-h4pteglu3
concentration (data not shown), and the sum of these two
amplitudes (total absorption decrease) was shown to have a
stoichiometric dependence on all three reaction compo-

nents: ch3-h4pteglu3, mete, and hcy (figure 5). these
observations suggest that the decrease in absorbance at 324
nm requires formation of a mete‚ch3-h4pteglu3‚hcy ternary
complex.
the total absorption decrease at 324 nm reaches a
maximum of 0.617 ( 0.008 (figure 5c). to take into account
the 3 nm shift of the absorbance minimum between the model
difference spectrum for protonation (dotted lines in figure
4) and that observed in the stopped flow (solid lines in figure
4), 324 nm was compared to 321 nm from the model
difference spectrum for protonation, with the assumption that
the spectra shift but the extinction coefficients do not change.
it should be noted that these wavelengths are near, but not
at, the minima in their respective difference absorbance

in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer was fit to two exponentials,
and the amplitudes of each phase were added together. (a) mete
and hcy (60 µm each) were reacted with ch3-h4pteglu3 (10200 µm), (b) mete (10-120 µm) and hcy (60 µm) were reacted

spectra. the absorbance decrease for transferring 60 µm
ch3-h4pteglu3 from the mete binary complex into 80%
acetonitrile, ph 3 at 321 nm, is 0.7. therefore, the changes
in stopped-flow absorbance are consistent with formation of

activation of methyltetrahydrofolate by mete
a ternary complex in which ch3-h4pteglu3 is almost
completely protonated.
the total absorbance decrease was consistently lower when
mete was preincubated with hcy (figure 5a,b) instead of
ch3-h4pteglu3 (figure 5c) under the same conditions,
probably because the ternary complex is not fully saturated
at 60 µm hcy, and thus the greatest absorbance decrease
that can be expected at this hcy concentration is about 0.52,
consistent with the 60 µm data point in figure 5c. additionally, a slightly lower initial concentration of the e‚hcy binary
complex is suggested by the saturation point in figure 5a
and would produce a smaller absorbance decrease.
spectra of reaction intermediates were determined by
fitting the spectra collected during the reaction to a set of
three consecutive exponentials (a f b f c f d; fits to
parallel exponentials yielded extinction coefficients that were
either negative or too high to be believable). when the mete‚
hcy binary complex was reacted with ch3-h4pteglu3, the
starting spectrum from this fit did not agree with the sum of
the spectra of the reactants, mete‚hcy and ch3-h4pteglu3
(figure 6a). instead, the spectrum of the first species observed
after the instrument dead time (intermediate a) closely
resembled the spectrum of the mete‚ch3-h4pteglu3 binary
complex (shown as a difference spectrum in figure 6b),
suggesting that ch3-h4pteglu3 binds in the instrument dead
time forming a ternary complex with absorbance properties
similar to those observed when hcy is not present. in
contrast, when the mete‚ch3-h4pteglu3 binary complex was
reacted with hcy, the starting spectrum calculated from the
fit (intermediate a) and the actual initial spectrum were
essentially the same (data not shown). subtraction of the
initial mete‚ch3-h4pteglu3 binary complex spectrum from
the spectra of the next two intermediates yielded difference
spectra that were very similar to those expected for protonation of ch3-h4pteglu3 in a hydrophobic environment
(figure 7). while the shapes of the intermediate spectra are
alike, the amplitude of intermediate b is smaller, and it is
not until the formation of intermediate c that the “full”
magnitude of the absorbance decrease is observed.
observation of a phase corresponding to methyl transfer.
after formation of the ternary complex and the initial
decrease in absorbance, a phase of increasing absorbance
was observed in the stopped flow (figure 3). this phase is
likely to represent the chemical step, since conversion of
ch3-h4pteglu3 to h4pteglu3 is expected to lead to an
absorbance increase at 324 nm (figure 2c). the rate constant
for this phase is substrate-independent and corresponds with
the kchem of 0.25 ( 0.09 s-1 that was determined directly by
monitoring the irreversible transfer of the radiolabel from
[methyl-14c]ch3-h4pteglu3 to form [methyl-14c]met [figure
2 in the accompanying paper (35)]. these data together
demonstrate that protonation of ch3-h4pteglu3 occurs in a
kinetically competent fashion. however, the final difference
spectrum observed in the diode array, intermediate d, did
not match that expected for free h4pteglu3 (figure 2c). to
confirm that this calculated final spectrum was actually the
spectrum of the reaction product, equimolar mete and ch3h4pteglu3 were reacted with hcy in a spectrophotometer;
the observed spectrum did indeed agree with the actual and
calculated spectra of the product seen in the stopped-flow
spectrophotometer when hcy was the limiting substrate
(figure 8). this difference spectrum is very red shifted with

respect to that of h4pteglu3 in aqueous solution, reminiscent
of the red shift observed with increasing hydrophobicity of
the ch3-h4pteglu3 environment both in solution and upon
binding to mete (7, 16). it is therefore likely that the h4pteglu3 product remains bound on the enzyme after a single
turnover, though perhaps only at the high concentrations of
mete and h4pteglu3 employed in this experiment.

is observed in the stopped-flow traces. at least one extra
phase is observed after the initial absorbance decreases
(figure 9), with a rate constant slightly greater than kchem.

figure 7: difference spectra of reaction intermediates b and c.
difference spectra of intermediates b (dashed line) and c (solid
line) were obtained by subtracting the starting spectrum of mete‚
ch3-h4pteglu3 (60 µm) from the spectrum of each subsequent
reaction intermediate. the difference spectrum for protonation of
ch3-h4pteglu3 in a hydrophobic environment (dotted line) was
obtained by subtracting the mete‚ch3-h4pteglu3 binary complex
spectrum from the solution spectrum of ch3-h4pteglu3 taken at
ph 3 in 80% acetonitrile.

figure 9: variation of the final absorbance at 324 nm with the
concentration of hcy. (a) mete (60 µm) was preincubated with
ch3-h4pteglu3 (60 µm) before mixing with hcy (60 µm-1 mm)
and monitoring the absorbance change in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer at 324 nm. (b) absorbance changes at 324 nm
associated with reaction of mete and ch3-h4pteglu3 (60 µm each)
with 300 µm hcy. the data were fit to four parallel exponentials,
as indicated by the colored circles: kobs1 ) 126 s-1 (red circle),
kobs2 ) 26 s-1 (orange circle), kobs3 ) 4.8 s-1 (green circle), and
kobs4 ) 0.23 s-1 (blue circle).

figure 8: difference spectra for product formation during a single
turnover of mete and for formation of intermediate d. mete and
ch3-h4pteglu3 (60 µm each) were titrated with 2 equiv of hcy
(the dashed line shows the difference spectrum obtained after
addition of 1 equiv; the dotted line is after addition of 2 equiv) at
which point the absorbance at 345 nm reached a maximum. the
spectrum of the initial mete‚ch3-h4pteglu3 binary complex was
subtracted from the subsequent spectra to obtain difference spectra.
the difference spectrum for formation of intermediate d (solid line)
was obtained by subtracting the initial spectrum of the mete‚ch3h4pteglu3 binary complex.

the chemical step decreases progressively as the concentration
of hcy is raised. however, essentially complete transfer of
a radiolabeled methyl group was observed at similarly high
concentrations of hcy in the course of determining kchem [see
accompanying paper (35)].
the spectrum of an additional species, intermediate e, was
determined assuming a four-step consecutive mechanism (a
f b f c f d f e) and resembled protonated tetrahydrofolate (figure 10a,b). since this complexity was dependent
on the presence of excess hcy, we hypothesized that hcy

was binding to the enzyme after methyl transfer, to form a
mete‚h4pteglu3‚hcy ternary complex. to explore this
possibility, h4pteglu3 was formed by adding aliquots of hcy
to a cuvette containing equimolar mete and ch3-h4pteglu3
(figure 8). further titration of this mete/product solution
with hcy caused a change in absorbance, which mirrored
that observed in stopped-flow experiments performed at high
hcy concentrations (figure 10a). the initial mete‚ch3-h4pteglu3 spectrum was subtracted from the subsequent spectra
obtained with increasing concentrations of hcy. the difference spectra associated with the hcy titration and with
formation of intermediate e most resemble difference spectra
for conversion of mete-bound ch3-h4pteglu3 to h4pteglu3
protonated in a hydrophobic environment (figure 10b). the
protonation of h4pteglu3 in the presence of mete and hcy
implies that a “mixed” mete‚h4pteglu3‚hcy ternary complex
can be formed that has absorbance properties similar to those
of the substrate ternary complex. the absorbance at 324 nm
was plotted against the concentration of hcy, and the data
were fit to eq 2, resulting in a kd of 34 ( 5 µm for hcy
binding to the e‚h4pteglu3 complex (figure 10c). since
formation of the mixed ternary complex occurs with slightly
faster kinetics than methyl transfer, the appearance of this
complex largely masks the absorbance change accompanying

methyl transfer. scheme 1 shows the complete set of steps
in the mete reaction, starting with the mete‚hcy or mete‚
ch3-h4pteglu3 binary complex and including the formation
of the mixed ternary e‚hcy‚h4pteglu3 complex.
it is not yet clear whether high concentrations of hcy cause
inhibition of turnover under physiological conditions due to
the formation of a mixed ternary complex. no inhibition by
hcy has been observed under steady-state conditions, perhaps
because the concentration of mete is very low (∼250 nm),
and initial rates are measured, such that very little h4pteglu3
is formed during the course of our measurements. however,
as discussed in the accompanying paper (35), the kcat for
mete is about 2-fold lower than for kchem, suggesting that
release of products from the mete‚h4pteglu3‚met ternary
complex may be partially rate limiting.
since the pka values for n5 of h4folate and ch3-h4folate
are very close, 4.82 and 5.1, respectively (15, 16), it is not
unreasonable that their pka values would be affected similarly
by a particular environment. the mixed ternary complex
appears to be relatively stable and presents a unique
opportunity to further investigate a mete ternary complex
by methods that cannot be used with the catalytically
competent ternary complex. not only can the protonation
state of h4pteglu3 be probed, but more information about
the structural differences between the binary and ternary
complexes may be gained.
discussion

figure 10: formation of a mete‚h4pteglu3‚hcy ternary complex.
(a) the products from a single turnover of mete (60 µm) were
titrated with hcy (final concentration ) 713 µm). the spectrum
of the initial mete‚ch3-h4pteglu3 binary complex was subtracted
from the subsequent spectra to obtain difference spectra (solid gray
lines). the difference spectrum associated with formation of
intermediate e (dashed black line) was obtained by subtracting out
the initial spectrum of the mete‚ch3-h4pteglu3 binary complex.
(b) the spectrum of the mete‚ch3-h4folate binary complex (60
µm) at ph 7.2 (solid black line) was subtracted from the spectrum
of h4folate (60 µm) at ph 3 in 80% acetonitrile (dashed black
line) to obtain the difference spectrum (dotted gray line) associated
with protonation of h4folate in a hydrophobic environment. (c) the
decreasing absorbance at 324 nm due to hcy binding was fit to eq
2, from which a kd of 34 ( 5 µm was obtained.

model studies of methyl transfer reactions. the methyl
transfer reaction catalyzed by mete is chemically challenging. model studies of nucleophilic methyl transfer reactions
have demonstrated that the reaction rate is influenced by the
reactivity of both the nucleophile and the leaving group (21).
in these studies, which employed (2-aminocyclopentyl)ethyl
onium salts with a p-nitrophenyl leaving group, the reactivity
of an ammonium salt was shown to be ∼100-fold lower than
that of the analogous sulfonium compound. this lower
reactivity correlated with greater dependence on nucleophilicity, reflected in a brønsted beta of g0.49, compared to 0.34
for the sulfonium salts. more recent studies have extended
the comparison to include the reactivity of protonated tertiary
vs quaternary amines (22). these studies employed methylammonium and methylsulfonium salts. measurements of the
disproportionation of dimethylamine to mono- and trimethylamine in water under conditions where half of the dimethylamine is protonated showed that the reaction rate is
approximately 5-fold slower than the rate of reaction of the
same concentration of  xxxd3337xxx  with dimethylamine. the rate of disproportionation of dimethylamine was
also dependent on the protonation state of the donor and
acceptor amines and was fastest when the ph was equivalent
to the pka of dimethylamine (22) these studies also
compared the reactivity of methylsulfonium and methylammonium salts, and for these compounds the reactivity of the
sulfonium was about 10000-fold greater than that of methylammonium. thus, compared to the reactivity of a sulfonium,
like  xxxd3156xxx , as a methyl donor, these studies would predict
that a protonated tertiary amine would be between 500- and
50000-fold less reactive. de novo biosynthesis of methyl
groups requires a tertiary amine precursor, and the model
chemistry indicates that formation of protonated ch3-h4folate improves the substrate reactivity.

factors leading to the stabilization of protonated ch3h4pteglu3 in the ternary complex. the experiments reported
in this contribution have established that absorbance changes
consistent with protonation of ch3-h4pteglu3 occur only
when a ternary mete‚ch3-h4pteglu3‚hcy complex forms.
these changes occur substantially faster than the subsequent transfer of the methyl group from ch3-h4pteglu3 to
hcy, allowing the accumulation of the activated ternary
complex. the maximum observed absorbance decrease
associated with formation of the mete‚ch3-h4pteglu3‚
hcy ternary complex (figure 5c) is approximately 90% of
that observed for transfer of 60 µm ch3-h4folate from the
mete‚ch3-h4pteglu3 binary complex to 80% acetonitrile at
ph 3. assuming that the extinction coefficients are the same
for protonated forms of enzyme-bound and free ch3h4folate, these observations suggest that the pka of ch3h4pteglu3 in the ternary complex must lie well above ph 7.
the factors responsible for the stabilization of the protonated form of ch3-h4pteglu3 in the ternary complex remain
to be established. the 3 nm red shift associated with the
difference spectrum seen on protonation of ch3-h4pteglu3
when bound to mete as compared to that observed in acidic
acetonitrile suggests that the active site of mete is more
hydrophobic than 80% acetonitrile (dielectric of ∼47 at 20
°c) (23). indeed, many studies suggest that typical protein
active sites are characterized by low dielectric constants
(dielectric of ∼4) (24, 25). such a low dielectric constant
would be expected to disfavor protonation of ch3-h4pteglu3
in the binary complex, provided that the positive charge on
n5 remains uncompensated by a negative charge provided
by the protein. indeed, the structure of the binary mete‚
ch3-h4pteglu3 does not reveal any mechanism for stabilizing
a positive charge on n5 (9). however, the interaction
between paired positive and negative charges in an environment of low dielectric is extremely favorable (26). bringing
the partial negative charge on the sulfur of homocysteine in
proximity to n5 of ch3-h4pteglu3 would be expected to
favor protonation of ch3-h4pteglu3 when the ternary
complex forms.
the structural characterization of mete indicates that the
initial binary mete‚ch3-h4pteglu3 complex has the folate

oriented in a nonproductive binding mode, with the n5methyl group pointing away from the homocysteine binding
site and one face of the folate exposed to solvent. as
discussed in the introduction, the folate must reorient in the
ternary complex to allow methyl transfer. this reorientation
may account for one of the two phases associated with
formation of the fully protonated ternary complex, although
we do not yet know which phase this might be.
an additional factor that could potentially contribute to
stabilization of ch3-h4pteglu3 in the ternary complex is a
cation-pi interaction (27). a conserved tryptophan is seen
to stack against ch3-h4pteglu3 in the binary complex (9).
if this tryptophan is still close to n5 of the folate substrate
in the ternary complex, it may also help to raise the ch3h4pteglu3 pka via a cation-pi interaction.
relevance to other enzymes that use tertiary amines
as methyl donors. activation of ch3-h4folate is proposed
to proceed via protonation in both cobalamin-dependent and
cobalamin-independent  xxxg1479xxx  as well as in
other proteins that utilize ch3-h4folate or other tertiary
amines as a methyl donor (7, 16, 28). these enzymes include
the methyltetrahydrofolate:corrinoid fe/s protein methyltransferase (acse), which catalyzes the methylation of the
cob(i)amide in the corrinoid fe/s protein by ch3-h4folate
(29), and the mtmb, mtbb1, and mttb enzymes involved
in generation of methylcorrinoids from monomethylamine,
dimethylamine, and trimethylamine, respectively, in methanosarcina barkeri (30-32). the pka values for methylamines
suggest that these substrates may bind in the protonated form
at neutral ph, although, to our knowledge, this has not been
demonstrated for any of these enzymes.
it has been proposed that ch3-h4folate is protonated in
the acse binary complex, in the absence of the corrinoid
fe/s protein (28). nmr spectroscopy indicated that the
single, sharp peak of (6r,s)-[methyl-13c]ch3-h4folate split
into two broader peaks upon titration with acse. the
chemical shift for the higher field signal was assigned to
the s isomer and was determined to shift from 42.20 ppm
free in solution to 42.58 ppm when bound on acse. the
authors attributed this 0.38 ppm chemical shift to protonation
of ch3-h4folate. however, ph titrations of free (6r,s)[methyl-13c]ch3-h4folate have indicated that protonation of

activation of methyltetrahydrofolate by mete
n5 is accompanied by a much larger chemical shift, 2.12.4 ppm, of the 13c signal (16, 28).
seravalli et al. also showed that binding of ch3-h4folate
to acse was accompanied by proton uptake, suggesting that
a proton is involved in the binding. however, the kd was
essentially independent of ph between 4.85 and 8.5, a result
that is difficult to reconcile with the proton uptake data.
therefore, the available data neither conclusively refute nor
demonstrate that ch3-h4folate is protonated in the acse
binary complex.
the catalytic strategies of cobalamin-dependent methionine
synthase (meth) and mete are remarkably similar, despite
the lack of sequence similarity in these two enzymes and
the marked differences in the mode of folate binding. in both
cases, binary enzyme‚ch3-h4folate complexes are unprotonated, and protonation occurs only in the presence of the
methyl acceptor. red shifts of the ch3-h4folate spectrum
on binding to a fragment of meth containing only the
substrate binding sites indicate that this folate binding site
is also relatively hydrophobic and would thus disfavor
protonation (16). formation of a complex in which the  xxxd1771xxx  cofactor is positioned to receive the methyl group
from ch3-h4folate would introduce a partial negative charge
into this hydrophobic environment and thus might favor
protonation of ch3-h4folate. proton transfer is avoided in
meth because the  xxxd1771xxx  nucleophile that is the
proximate methyl acceptor has a very low pka for protonation
of the electrons in the dz2 orbital (33, 34). although  xxxd1771xxx  is fully activated at neutral ph, the next step in the
reaction catalyzed by meth is nucleophilic attack of hcy
on methylcobalamin. hcy is activated in meth, as in mete,
by coordination to a zinc at the active site of the enzyme.
therefore, meth, the “improbable” enzyme, and mete, the
“impossible” enzyme, appear to employ highly similar
strategies to effect catalysis of methyl transfer.
