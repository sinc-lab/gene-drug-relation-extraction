phagocytes

roles for  xxxg745xxx  and fibrin( xxxd2046xxx ) in cytokine/chemokine production and
macrophage adhesion in vivo
frank m. szaba and stephen t. smiley

extravascular coagulation leading to fibrin deposition accompanies many immune and inflammatory responses. although recognized by pathologists for
decades, and probably pathologic under
certain conditions, the physiologic functions of extravascular coagulation remain
to be fully defined. this study demonstrates that  xxxg745xxx  can activate macrophage adhesion and prompt interleukin-6
(il-6) and  xxxg357xxx  ( xxxg357xxx ) production in vivo. peritoneal macrophages were elicited with thioglycollate (tg) and then activated in situ,
either by intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (lps) or by injection of
antigen into mice bearing antigen-primed

t cells. others previously established that
such treatments stimulate macrophage
adhesion to the mesothelial lining of the
peritoneal cavity. the present study demonstrates that  xxxg745xxx  functions in this
process, as macrophage adhesion was
suppressed by  xxxd2455xxx , a highly specific  xxxg745xxx  antagonist, and induced by
direct peritoneal administration of purified  xxxg745xxx . although recent studies
established that  xxxg746xxx  ( xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx ) mediates some of  xxxg745xxx ’s proinflammatory activities macrophage adhesion occurred normally in
 xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx –deficient mice. however, adhesion was suppressed in fibrin( xxxd2046xxx )deficient mice, suggesting that fibrin for-

mation stimulates macrophage adhesion
in vivo. this study also suggests that
fibrin regulates chemokine/cytokine production in vivo, as direct injection of
 xxxg745xxx  stimulated peritoneal accumulation of il-6 and  xxxg357xxx  in a fibrin( xxxd2046xxx )dependent manner. given that prior studies have clearly established inflammatory
roles for  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx ,  xxxg745xxx  probably has
pleiotropic functions during inflammation, stimulating vasodilation and mast
cell degranulation via  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx , and activating cytokine/chemokine production and
macrophage adhesion via fibrin( xxxd2046xxx ).

introduction
vasodilation and increased vascular permeability are among the earliest
signs of inflammation. these events stimulate the extravasation of
inactive coagulant precursors, which become activated upon exposure to
extravascular tissues. the ensuing coagulation cascade culminates with
the generation of  xxxg745xxx , a protease that cleaves extravasated fibrinogen, prompting its polymerization and deposition as fibrin. accordingly,
localized extravascular fibrin deposition accompanies many type 1 t
helper cell (th1)–associated responses, including autoimmune neuropathologies,1-4 glomerulonephritis,5,6 rheumatoid arthritis,7-9 crohn’s disease,10,11 allograft rejection,12,13 delayed-type hypersensitivity,14-19 and
viral infections.20,21 for some time, it has been appreciated that such
th1-associated coagulation has physiologic consequences, as the swelling that accompanies delayed-type hypersensitivity responses is suppressed in anticoagulated or fibrinogen-deficient subjects.14-19 however,
the full significance of immune-associated extravascular coagulation
remains to be defined.
recent studies suggest that  xxxg745xxx  is a physiologic mediator of
inflammatory events. administration of recombinant hirudin, a highly
specific  xxxg745xxx  antagonist, reduces pathology and leukocyte infiltration in a mouse glomerulonephritis model.22 hirudin analogs also
suppress mast cell degranulation and vasodilation in a carrageenininduced inflammation model,23 and prevent onset and ameliorate
established disease in mouse arthritis models.24,25 together, these studies
strongly suggest that  xxxg745xxx  has physiologic functions during
immunity/inflammation.

the vasodilatory activities of  xxxg745xxx  likely result from its
capacity to stimulate  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx , a 7-transmembrane–spanning, gprotein–coupled receptor activated upon cleavage by  xxxg745xxx .26
consistent with the aforementioned hirudin studies,  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx –
deficient mice27 exhibit diminished inflammation in glomerulonephritis and carrageenin models.22,23 in addition, cutaneous injection
of a  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx –activating peptide stimulates mast cell degranulation
and vasodilation in wild-type mice,23 and vascular permeability is
suppressed in  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx –deficient mice.28 thus,  xxxg745xxx -stimulated
activation of  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx  may constitute one mechanism by which
extravascular coagulation influences inflammation.
 xxxg745xxx  may also influence inflammation through its ability to
stimulate fibrin deposition. indeed, fibrin is a ligand for  xxxg1127xxx 
(icam-1),29,30  xxxg1206xxx / xxxg1209xxx  (cr3,  xxxg1206xxx   xxxg1209xxx ),31-33 and  xxxg1208xxx / xxxg1209xxx 
(cr4,  xxxg23xxx   xxxg24xxx   xxxg163xxx /95),34,35 adhesion-promoting receptors expressed by
endothelial cells, neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, as well as
subsets of dendritic, natural killer, and t cells. studies using
blocking peptides and specific monoclonal antibodies suggest that
 xxxg1206xxx / xxxg1209xxx -fibrin interactions regulate leukocyte adherence to
vascular clots36 and implanted biomaterials.37,38 thus, extravascular fibrin may act as a provisional adhesion matrix for leukocyte
accumulation at sites of inflammation.
extravascular fibrin may also directly stimulate leukocyte
activities. fibrin( xxxd2046xxx ) reportedly stimulates  xxxg2296xxx 
alpha (tnf␣) and il-1␤ expression by macrophages39,40 and

chemokine secretion by endothelial cells,41,42 fibroblasts,43 and
neutrophils.44 we recently demonstrated that fibrinogen also stimulates macrophage chemokine expression, apparently via toll-like
receptor 4 (tlr4).45 as prior studies suggest that tlr4 signals
“danger” in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps),46-48 we
propose that tlr4 may likewise signal danger in response to
extravascular coagulation, thereby stimulating the production of
chemokines, attracting leukocytes, and enhancing immune surveillance at sites of inflammation.
until recently, few studies had convincingly evaluated inflammatory roles for fibrin in vivo, in part due to a lack of suitable
agents for experimental depletion or antagonism of fibrinogen.
ancrod, a proteolytic enzyme derived from snake venom, proteolyzes fibrinogen, transiently generating a fibrinogen-deficient state.
experimental administration of ancrod produced data consistent
with roles for fibrin in experimental encephalomyelitis,1,4 glomerulonephritis,49,50 arthritis,51 transplant rejection,52 and the containment of bacterial infections.53,54 recently, gene-targeted fibrinogendeficient mice were generated55 and used to confirm roles for
fibrin( xxxd2046xxx ) in wound healing56 and the control of bacterial
infections.57 detailed studies of the immune and inflammatory
responses in fibrinogen-deficient mice have yet to be reported.
here, we define and distinguish roles for  xxxg745xxx ,  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx , and
fibrinogen in a mouse peritonitis model. we demonstrate that  xxxg745xxx 
plays an important role in stimulating the adhesion of inflammatory
peritoneal macrophages in vivo. taking advantage of  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx –deficient
and fibrinogen-deficient mice, we demonstrate that  xxxg745xxx -stimulated
macrophage adhesion is  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx  independent, but fibrinogen dependent.
we also demonstrate that  xxxg745xxx  stimulates the peritoneal accumulation of cytokines and chemokines in a fibrinogen-dependent manner.
whereas others have clearly established inflammatory roles for  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1598xxx ,22,23,28 our data indicate that extravascular coagulation leading to
 xxxg745xxx  production can also regulate inflammation through fibrinogen,
presumably via  xxxg745xxx -stimulated production of fibrin.

days, the differentiated cells were routinely ⬎ 90% cd4⫹v␣2⫹v␤5⫹ by
flow cytometry. after washing with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs), we
adoptively transferred 10 ⫻ 106 of these th1 effectors to naı̈ve mice by

measuring  xxxg1141xxx  production by sandwich enzyme-linked

in vivo assays for peritoneal macrophage adhesion and
il-6/ xxxg357xxx  production
to elicit inflammatory macrophages, mice received intraperitoneal injections of 3
ml sterile thioglycollate (tg) broth (becton dickinson microbiology systems,
cockeysville, md). assays were performed 4 days later, when macrophage
recruitment was maximal (not shown). for antigen-specific assays, mice received
adoptive transfers of ot-ii th1 cells 18 to 24 hours prior to initiation of
macrophage activation by intraperitoneal injection of 50 ␮g ova in 200 ␮l sterile
pbs (life technologies, rockville, md). alternatively, tg-primed mice that
had not received th1 cells were given intraperitoneal injections of escherichia
coli serotype 0111:b4 lps (sigma chemical, st louis, mo) or human alpha
 xxxg745xxx  (enzyme research laboratories, south bend, in). the  xxxg745xxx  used
in these experiments was found to contain less than 0.1 units/ml endotoxin, as
determined by pyrochrome limulus amebocyte lysate assay (associates of
cape cod, falmouth, ma). at the indicated times, mice were killed and
peritoneal cells and fluid were harvested by washing the cavity with 7 ml pbs.
total cell numbers were determined using a hemocytometer and the percentages
of macrophages were assessed by evaluation of wright-giemsa–stained cytospin
smears (hema 3; fisher scientific, pittsburgh, pa). macrophages were identified as large cells with abundant cytoplasm and a single nucleus containing pale
diffuse chromatin. flow cytometry confirmed similar frequencies of macrophages (forward/side scatterhigh  xxxg1206xxx   xxxg1209xxx ⫹gr-1⫺, not shown). il-6 and monocyte

materials and methods
animals
mice aged 6 to 10 weeks old were used for these experiments. c57bl/6 mice
were purchased from taconic (germantown, ny). transgenic mice were bred at
the trudeau institute animal breeding facility. all experimental mice were ageand sex-matched.  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx –deficient mice27 (backcrossed 6 generations to c57bl/6
mice) were originally obtained from the jackson laboratory (bar harbor, me).
fibrinogen-deficient mice55 (backcrossed 7 generations to c57bl/6 mice) and
ot-ii t-cell receptor transgenic mice58 were generously supplied by jay degen
(children’s hospital medical center, cincinnati, oh) and francis carbone
(university of melbourne, parkville, australia)/william heath (the walter and
eliza hall institute, parkville, australia), respectively. animals were housed in a
specific pathogen-free facility and cared for according to the trudeau institute
animal care and use committee guidelines.
generation of antigen-specific th1 cells
naı̈ve cd4⫹ t cells were enriched from spleens and lymph nodes of ot-ii
t-cell receptor transgenic mice58 using cd4 monoclonal antibody (mab)–
based magnetic cell sorting (miltenyi biotec, auburn, ca) followed by
density gradient enrichment of resting naı̈ve cells (interface of 80%/62%
percoll). successful purification was confirmed by flow cytometry (⬎ 85%
cd4⫹v␣2⫹v␤5⫹). we then cultured the ot-ii cells (2.5 ⫻ 105/ml) with
 xxxd2655xxx –treated splenic c57bl/6 antigen-presenting cells (1 ⫻ 106/
ml) in rpmi media containing 7.5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine,
50 u/ml penicillin, 50 ␮g/ml streptomycin, and 50 ␮m  xxxd26xxx . to generate th1 cells, we supplemented cultures with ovalbumin

refludan59 (16 000 antithrombin units/mg) was reconstituted as directed by
the manufacturer (hoechst marion roussel, kansas city, mo), diluted in
sterile pbs, and injected along with the activating stimuli. in pilot studies,
we established that 2 mg/kg  xxxd2455xxx  efficiently antagonized coagulation in
mice, as reported for recombinant hirudin.22 the short half-life of  xxxd2455xxx 
led us to evaluate dosages up to 20 mg/kg, which also promoted effective
anticoagulation without any apparent toxicity (not shown).
statistics
statistical significance was evaluated by student t test using the program
instat 2.01 (graphpad software, san diego, ca).

results
injection of inflammatory stimuli into the peritoneal cavity of mice
prompts an initial recruitment of neutrophils, followed by an
accumulation of macrophages. upon subsequent activation in situ,
these inflammation-elicited macrophages adhere to the mesothelial
lining of the peritoneal cavity,60,61 resulting in a dramatic decrease
in the number of macrophages that can be recovered by peritoneal
lavage.60,61 this assay provides a quantitative means to monitor the
activation of macrophage adhesion in vivo.
prior studies using this assay established that macrophage
adhesion can be triggered by specific antigen in mice bearing
antigen-sensitized t cells.60-63 in our version of this model, we

inflammatory roles for  xxxg745xxx  and fibrin( xxxd2046xxx )

 xxxg745xxx  in the activation of macrophage adhesion in vivo. to
specifically evaluate  xxxg745xxx , we performed peritoneal macrophage adhesion assays in the presence of  xxxd2455xxx , a commercially
available hirudin analog.59 as discussed in the “introduction,”
hirudin analogs were previously used to establish inflammatory
roles for  xxxg745xxx  in mouse models.22-25
we found that  xxxd2455xxx  significantly inhibited the activation of
peritoneal macrophages in vivo. both ot-ii/ova- and lps-stimulated
macrophage adhesion was suppressed by administration of  xxxd2455xxx 
(figure 1a-b), suggesting that  xxxg745xxx  has critical adhesionpromoting functions in these peritoneal models. notably, further studies
confirmed an earlier report64 that intraperitoneal injection of purified
 xxxg745xxx  itself can activate macrophage adhesion (figure 2a).
as  xxxg745xxx  appeared to be an important mediator of macrophage
adhesion, it had to be generated during the course of our peritoneal
assays. indeed, treatment with lps is well known to up-regulate
expression of  xxxg748xxx ,65,66 an initiator of the coagulation cascade,
thereby stimulating  xxxg745xxx  production. consistent with lps functioning via the induction of coagulant activities that prompt  xxxg745xxx 
production, kinetic analyses revealed that  xxxg745xxx  stimulated macrophage adhesion more rapidly than did lps (figure 2b). however, the
lps-stimulated macrophage adhesion was more complete, even at
saturating  xxxg745xxx  doses, suggesting that lps may activate macrophage
adhesion via both  xxxg745xxx -dependent and -independent mechanisms.
 xxxg745xxx -stimulated macrophage adhesion is  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx 
independent and fibrinogen dependent

figure 1. the activation of inflammation-elicited peritoneal macrophages is  xxxg745xxx  dependent in vivo. (a) the activation-induced adhesion of peritoneal macrophages
by antigen-specific th1 cells is  xxxg745xxx  dependent. ot-ii transgenic t-cell receptor th1
effector cells were adoptively transferred to c57bl/6 mice that had been primed with tg (3
ml intraperitoneally) 3 days earlier. the next day, ova peptide (50 ␮g intraperitoneally) or
pbs vehicle (200 ␮l) were administered, and 5 hours later peritoneal exudate cells were
harvested and macrophages were enumerated. where indicated, mice received  xxxd2455xxx 
(2 mg/kg intraperitoneally) at the time of ova administration. the data depicts the averages
and standard deviations of groups of 3 mice. th1 cells induced antigen-specific macrophage activation (p ⬍ .01), which was suppressed by  xxxd2455xxx  (p ⫽ .02). this experiment
was replicated twice. (b) the activation-induced adhesion of peritoneal macrophages by
lps is  xxxg745xxx  dependent. peritoneal macrophages were elicited with tg (3 ml
intraperitoneally). four days later, lps (1 ␮g intraperitoneally) or vehicle control (200 ␮l
pbs) were administered, and macrophage numbers in peritoneal exudates were determined 5 hours later. where indicated, mice also received relfudan (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally) at the time of lps administration. the data depicts the averages and standard
deviations of groups of 5 mice. lps induced macrophage activation (p ⬍ .0001) that was
suppressed by  xxxd2455xxx  (p ⬍ .0001). this experiment has been replicated 4 times.

inject mice with tg to recruit inflammatory macrophages, adoptively transfer ot-ii transgenic t-cell receptor th1 cells, and then
inject ova, the antigen recognized by ot-ii t cells. after 5 hours,
we harvest the peritoneal cells and enumerate macrophages by
performing differential cell counts. as shown in figure 1a,
administration of tg recruits macrophages to the peritoneal cavity,
and adoptive transfer of ot-ii tcrtg th1 cells followed by
injection of ova greatly decreases numbers of recoverable macrophages. this response is t cell and antigen dependent, as neither
th1 cells nor ova stimulate macrophage adhesion when injected
alone (figure 1a). as previously reported,62 this model can also be
used to assay macrophage adhesion stimulated by lps (figure 1b).
roles for  xxxg745xxx  in macrophage adhesion in vivo

as the procoagulant enzyme  xxxg745xxx  has been implicated in a
variety of inflammatory responses,22-25,28 and as the nonspecific
anticoagulants heparin and warfarin reportedly block macrophage
adhesion in peritoneal models,60 we sought to evaluate roles for

implicated  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx  in transmitting  xxxg745xxx -mediated signals.22,23,28
thus, we evaluated the activation of macrophage adhesion in
 xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx –deficient mice.27 we first established that tg could stimulate recruitment of inflammatory macrophages to the peritoneal
cavity in  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx –deficient mice (figure 3). we then evaluated
macrophage adhesion and found no defects in antigen- or lpsstimulated adhesion in  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx –deficient mice (figure 3). thus,
 xxxg745xxx  stimulates the adhesion of peritoneal macrophages independent of  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx .
having ruled out  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx , we next examined whether thrombinstimulated fibrin formation accounts for  xxxg745xxx ’s role in macrophage adhesion. indeed, prior studies had established that peritoneal macrophages harvested soon after antigen stimulation are
coated with fibrin( xxxd2046xxx ).67 to explore functional roles for fibrin, we
evaluated macrophage adhesion in fibrinogen-deficient mice.55
again, we began by demonstrating that fibrinogen deficiency does
not suppress the tg-stimulated elicitation of macrophages to the
peritoneal cavity (figure 4). subsequent analyses revealed that
antigen-, lps-, and  xxxg745xxx -stimulated macrophage adhesion
were all fibrinogen dependent, each being significantly suppressed
in fibrinogen-deficient mice (figure 4 and figure 5). as antigen and
lps are known to stimulate macrophage procoagulant activity
leading to  xxxg745xxx  production, and as  xxxg745xxx  stimulates the
conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, the simplest interpretation of our
data is that  xxxg745xxx -mediated fibrin formation functions in the
adhesion of inflammatory macrophages.
 xxxg745xxx  stimulates fibrinogen-dependent il-6 and
 xxxg357xxx  production in vivo

during the course of these studies, we discovered that levels of the
cytokine il-6 (figure 5, right panel) and the chemokine  xxxg357xxx  (figure
5, middle panel) were significantly elevated in peritoneal fluid harvested
after administration of  xxxg745xxx . this  xxxg745xxx -stimulated cytokine/
chemokine production was suppressed by  xxxd2455xxx  (not shown) and
failed to occur in fibrinogen-deficient mice (figure 5). as with macrophage adhesion,  xxxg745xxx -stimulated cytokine/chemokine production
proceeded normally in  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx –deficient mice (not shown). stimulation
by ot-ii th1 cells/ova or lps also prompted cytokine/chemokine
production, but only the  xxxg745xxx -stimulated cytokine/chemokine production was suppressed by  xxxd2455xxx  and failed to occur in fibrinogen-

were compared, using the assays described in figure 1. the data represent the

repeated 3 times.

deficient mice (not shown). thus, although  xxxg745xxx  is not absolutely
required for cytokine/chemokine production in response to antigen or
lps,  xxxg745xxx  clearly has the capacity to stimulate secretion of
inflammatory mediators in vivo in a fibrin( xxxd2046xxx )-dependent manner.

discussion
in vitro,  xxxg745xxx  reportedly stimulates leukocyte chemotaxis68-70
and proliferation,71-73 and activates mast cell degranulation.74 in
theory, gene-targeting techniques could provide an unambiguous
means to study inflammatory roles for  xxxg745xxx  in vivo. however,
targeted deletion of  xxxg745xxx  or earlier components of the coagulation cascade (ie,  xxxg748xxx ,  xxxg750xxx , factor v, or  xxxg741xxx )75-81
results in embryonic or perinatal lethality. thus, it has not yet been
possible to produce adult animals genetically lacking the capacity
to generate  xxxg745xxx .
recent studies using analogs of recombinant hirudin suggest
that  xxxg745xxx  is a physiologic mediator of inflammatory events.
these highly specific  xxxg745xxx  antagonists reduce pathology in

(right panel, p ⬍ .001) that were fibrinogen dependent (p ⬍ .005 and p ⬍ .001,
respectively). the data represent averages and standard deviations of 4 animals per
group. we repeated this experiment twice.

murine glomerulonephritis,22 arthritis,24,25 and carrageenin-induced
inflammation models.23 mechanistically, some proinflammatory
activities of  xxxg745xxx  apparently result from its capacity to
stimulate  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx , as  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx –deficient mice exhibit diminished
inflammation in the glomerulonephritis and carrageenin models.22,23
in this report we demonstrated additional inflammatory roles for
 xxxg745xxx  in vivo using a mouse peritonitis model. specifically, we
found that  xxxd2455xxx , a hirudin-based pharmacologic  xxxg745xxx  antagonist, suppressed antigen- or lps-stimulated activation of macrophage
adhesion. we also demonstrated that intraperitoneal injection of purified
 xxxg745xxx  activates macrophage adhesion, and simultaneously stimulates
the peritoneal accumulation of il-6 and  xxxg357xxx . despite the aforementioned studies implicating  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx  in  xxxg745xxx -stimulated inflammation,
we found that the proinflammatory activities of  xxxg745xxx  in these
peritoneal models were  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx  independent. rather, both thrombinstimulated cytokine/chemokine production and macrophage adhesion required fibrinogen, as each was suppressed in fibrinogendeficient mice.
mechanistically, the simplest interpretation of our data are that
(1) antigen-specific t cells and lps elicit expression of procoagulant activity stimulating  xxxg745xxx  production, (2)  xxxg745xxx  cleaves
fibrinogen, prompting fibrin formation, and (3) fibrin then functions in macrophage adhesion.
although others have clearly shown that activation of inflammatory peritoneal macrophages stimulates their adhesion to the
mesothelial lining of the peritoneal cavity,61 we are presently
unable to distinguish between several potential models of fibrinstimulated macrophage adhesion. one possibility is that fibrin
directly mediates macrophage adhesion by simultaneously binding
 xxxg1206xxx / xxxg1209xxx  and icam-1, fibrin-binding receptors expressed by
macrophages and mesothelial cells, respectively. indeed, an analogous fibrin-mediated bridging model probably accounts for leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells.29,30 however, as neutrophils also
express high levels of  xxxg1206xxx / xxxg1209xxx , but are not depleted from the
peritoneal exudates upon macrophage activation62,64 (not shown),
we consider a simple bridging model to be an unlikely explanation
for  xxxg745xxx /fibrin( xxxd2046xxx )-stimulated macrophage adhesion.
alternatively, fibrin could stimulate macrophage adhesion by
activating mesothelial cell expression of ligands for macrophage
adhesion molecules. numerous recent studies have established that
fibrin( xxxd2046xxx ) can activate expression of molecules by endothelial
cells, fibroblasts, and leukocytes.39-45 however, if fibrin stimulates
mesothelial cell expression of adhesion-promoting ligands, those
ligands would need to be macrophage-specific, since neutrophils
were not depleted during our assays.
we favor a third model, in which fibrin directly binds and
cross-links receptors on macrophages, thereby transmitting signals
that stimulate adhesion. indeed, peritoneal macrophages harvested
shortly after stimulation are coated with fibrin( xxxd2046xxx ),67 and fibrin( xxxd2046xxx ) can directly stimulate macrophage secretion of cytokines
and chemokines in vitro.40,45 here, we demonstrated that injection
of  xxxg745xxx  activates fibrin( xxxd2046xxx )-dependent cytokine/chemokine
secretion in vivo. thus, we believe that  xxxg745xxx -stimulated fibrin
formation directly stimulates peritoneal macrophages, prompting
adhesion and secretion of inflammatory mediators. although we
cannot exclude contributions by other cell types, our preliminary
data strongly suggest that macrophages are the source of cytokine/
chemokine production in our model, as plastic adherent peritoneal
cells harvested shortly after the injection of  xxxg745xxx  secreted
elevated levels of il-6 and  xxxg357xxx  in vitro without any further
stimulation (not shown).

inflammatory roles for  xxxg745xxx  and fibrin( xxxd2046xxx )

1057

notably, our studies cannot distinguish between activities of
fibrin( xxxd2046xxx ) and those of fibrin( xxxd2046xxx )-degradation products ( xxxg778xxx ).
 xxxg778xxx  reportedly stimulate vascular permeability,82 endothelial cell
retraction,83,84 monocyte/macrophage il-1 and il-6 production,85,86 and leukocyte chemotaxis.87-89  xxxg778xxx  can be generated via
plasmin-mediated proteolysis of fibrin, and mice with reduced or
no plasmin have been generated by gene-targeted deletion of
plasminogen activators or plasminogen, respectively.90,91 such
plasmin-deficient mice display increased pathology in glomerulonephritis92 and arthritis51,93 models, suggesting that plasmingenerated  xxxg778xxx  may well function in inflammation.
regardless of the precise mechanism, our data are relevant to a
number of human pathologies. extravascular coagulation accompanies many th1-associated diseases, including autoimmune neuropathologies,1-4 glomerulonephritis,5,6 rheumatoid arthritis,7-9 crohn’s
disease,10,11 and allograft rejection.12,13 as our studies indicate that
 xxxg745xxx  and fibrin( xxxd2046xxx ) function to stimulate cytokine/chemokine production and macrophage adhesion in vivo, extravascular
coagulation likely exacerbates th1-associated chronic inflammation. thus, treatment modalities that specifically block inflammationassociated  xxxg745xxx  formation, fibrin deposition, and/or fibrin
degradation may constitute novel approaches for controlling pathologic th1 responses associated with autoimmunity and transplantation. they may likewise provide novel means to attenuate acute
inflammation resulting from trauma, burns, or infections.
our finding that  xxxg745xxx /fibrin( xxxd2046xxx ) can regulate cytokine/
chemokine production and macrophage adhesion may also be relevant
to septic shock. bacterial endotoxins prompt expression of procoagulant
activities,65,66 and recent studies indicate that therapeutic administration
of physiologic vascular anticoagulants reduces septic mortality,94-97
suggesting that procoagulants and/or their products (eg, fibrin,  xxxg778xxx )
play pathologic roles in sepsis. future studies will be required to clarify
roles for  xxxg745xxx /fibrin( xxxd2046xxx )-stimulated cytokine/chemokine production and/or macrophage adhesion during septic shock.
increased vascular permeability leading to plasma exudation is
among the earliest signs of inflammation. as plasma contains coagulant
precursors that become activated upon exposure to extravascular cells,
inflammation prompts extravascular  xxxg745xxx  and fibrin formation.
accumulating evidence suggests that this extravascular coagulation has
pleiotropic immune and inflammatory functions.  xxxg745xxx  clearly
plays multiple roles, evidenced by the diminished inflammatory responses of both  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx – and fibrinogen-deficient mice. notably, par-3
and par-4 are also activated by  xxxg745xxx ,98 though we have yet to
assess inflammatory functions of those  xxxg745xxx  receptors. our data
suggest that extravascular fibrin also has multiple inflammatory roles,
including the regulation of macrophage adhesion and the stimulation of
cytokine/chemokine production. given these pleiotropic activities, we
hypothesize that extravascular coagulation may function as nature’s adjuvant, both signaling “danger” at sites of inflammation
and providing a provisional fibrin matrix that spatially localizes the
ensuing host response.
