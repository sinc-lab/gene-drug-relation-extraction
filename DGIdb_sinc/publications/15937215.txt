abstract
the structurally divergent agents  xxxd2174xxx  and hexamethylene-bis-[dimethyl-(3-phthalimidopropyl)ammonium]dibromide
(w84) are known to interact competitively at a common allosteric site on muscarinic receptors. previous studies reported
that the m2 selectivity of  xxxd2174xxx  depended largely on the
edge (172–175) sequence in the second outer loop (o2) and on
419
asn near the junction of o3 and the seventh transmembrane
domain (tm7), whereas the selectivity of w84 depended on
nearby residues 177tyr and 423thr. however, it has so far
proven difficult to confer the high sensitivity for allosteric modulation of the m2 subtype onto the weakly sensitive m5 subtype
by substituting these key residues. we now have found that m2
423
thr, not 419asn, is the dominant residue in the o3/tm7
region for  xxxd2174xxx ’s high potency, although 419asn can sub-

muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (machrs) belong to the
super family of g protein-coupled receptors and possess a
highly conserved binding site (orthosteric site) for the endogenous agonist acetylcholine and for other traditional agonists
or competitive antagonists (orthosteric ligands); this site is
formed by the transmembrane domains (tm). the machrs
are among the best known of a growing number of g proteincoupled receptors that possess another site (allosteric site) at
which a second small ligand can bind, allowing ligand-ligand

stitute for 423thr in some contexts; in contrast, the presence of
419
asn reduces the potency of w84 in every context we have
studied. in addition, the orientation of 177tyr is crucial to high
sensitivity toward w84, and it seems that the proline residue at
position 179 in m5 (corresponding to m2172glu) may interfere
with that orientation. consistent with these observations, a
mutant  xxxg451xxx  with these three key mutations, m5p179e,
q184y, and h478t, showed dramatically increased sensitivity
for w84 (⬎100-fold), compared with the wild-type  xxxg451xxx .
this same mutant receptor approached m2 sensitivity toward
 xxxd2174xxx . thus,  xxxd2174xxx  and w84 derive high potency from
the same receptor domains (epitopes in o2 and near the junction between o3 and tm7), even though these allosteric agents
have quite different structures.

allosteric interactions at the external surface of the receptor
(christopoulos and kenakin, 2002; ellis, 2002). for ligands
with significant selectivity, the m2 subtype is the most sensitive of the five subtypes of machrs to allosteric modulation
(ellis et al., 1991; lee and el-fakahany, 1991; trankle et al.,
1998; ellis and seidenberg, 2000). although there is evidence
for the existence of multiple muscarinic allosteric sites (ellis
and seidenberg, 1989; potter et al., 1989; trankle and mohr,
1997; birdsall et al., 2001, lazareno et al., 2002; trankle et
al., 2003), many muscarinic allosteric modulators seem to act
at a “common allosteric site” (ellis and seidenberg, 1992;
trankle and mohr, 1997).
a number of investigations have attempted to identify the
residues that comprise this common allosteric site. initial

both agents are positively charged and interact competitively at an allosteric site on machrs, they have quite different structures. w84 is an
elongated dicationic molecule, whereas the tricationic  xxxd2174xxx  is rather
small and compact.

be useful to compare the effects of a detailed series of mutations in these regions on the allosteric affinities of  xxxd2174xxx 
and w84. we have found that the substitution of just three
residues of the m2 sequence into the  xxxg451xxx  (m5p179e,
q184y, and h478t) is sufficient to increase its sensitivity
toward w84 by more than 100-fold, slightly exceeding the
sensitivity of the  xxxg448xxx  for this ligand. this triply
mutated  xxxg451xxx  also has greatly increased sensitivity
for  xxxd2174xxx , although in this case, it did not reach the level
of the wild-type  xxxg448xxx .

materials and methods
materials.  xxxd247xxx ,  xxxd2174xxx , and polyethyleneimine were purchased from sigma chemical co. (st. louis,
mo). w84 is commercially available from tocris cookson inc. (ellisville, mo). the orthosteric radioligand [3h]n-methylscopolamine
chloride ([3h]nms; 81 ci/mmol) was obtained from perkinelmer life
and analytical sciences (boston, ma). glass fiber filters and all
other inorganic chemicals were from vwr international, inc.
(bridgeport, nj).
mutagenesis, receptor expression, and membrane preparation. human machrs were used throughout. some receptor constructs have been described previously: chimera cr3 (ellis et al.,
1993); mutants m2t423h, m5h478t, and cr3h478t (buller et al.,
2002); and mutants m2edge-lagq, m2n419v, m2n419k, and
m5v474n (gnagey et al., 1999). all mutation primers and sequencing primers used in this study were synthesized in the core facility
at hershey medical center. site-directed mutagenesis was carried
out using the quikchange kit from stratagene (la jolla, ca), as
reported previously (buller et al., 2002). mutations were confirmed
by sequencing in the core facility at hershey medical center. plasmids containing wild-type or mutant receptor genes were purified
using the qiagen plasmid purification kit (valencia, ca). purified
plasmid was transiently transfected into cos-7 cells using the polyfect transfection reagent (qiagen). approximately 48 h after
transfection, cells were scraped into 5 mm sodium/potassium/phosphate buffer, ph 7.4 (4 mm na2hpo4 and 1 mm kh2po4; pb) and
homogenized in the pb buffer on ice. after centrifugation at 50,000g
for 30 min, membrane pellets were resuspended with a glass homogenizer in 5 mm pb and stored in aliquots at ⫺70°c. protein concen-

receptor in which human m5 sequence has been replaced by the homologous human m2 sequence. in brief, the m2 residues that have been

cr5, 1–155; and  xxxd1578xxx , 1– 69 and 391– 466.

studies in this area mutated either conserved residues or
subtype-specific residues, and both approaches suggested
that the binding site for allosteric ligands lies extracellular to
the orthosteric site (ellis et al., 1993; leppik et al., 1994;
matsui et al., 1995). most subsequent mutagenic studies
have continued the subtype-specific approach after initial
findings derived from m2/m1 and especially m2/m5 chimeric
receptors. the structures of two allosteric ligands that have
been investigated intensively,  xxxd2174xxx  and w84, are shown
in fig. 1. the saturable type of antagonism seen with these
agents in isolated organ preparations was the first evidence
for a sensitivity of machrs for allosteric modulation (lullmann et al., 1969; clark and mitchelson, 1976). schematic
diagrams of some m2/m5 chimeras are shown at the top of
fig. 2. the first chimeric studies investigated  xxxd2174xxx  and
implicated only a short segment of sequence in tm6 or o3
(i.e., cr4 in fig. 2). however, subsequent studies with a
number of other ligands (including w84) have implicated
epitopes within a broad region containing o2 (cr3) and
within tm7 ( xxxd1578xxx ) but not the tm6/o3 region (cr4) found for
 xxxd2174xxx  (fig. 2). furthermore, despite the lack of influence
of the o2 loop on  xxxd2174xxx ’s potency in m2/m5 chimeras,
studies in which m1 and m2 sequences were interchanged
identified a role for an acidic region of o2 in  xxxd2174xxx ’s
preference for m2 (the “edge motif” at m2172–175); it seemed
that the essential acidic epitope in this region was shared by
m5 (leppik et al., 1994; gnagey et al., 1999). mutations of
individual amino acids have suggested that the essential
residue for  xxxd2174xxx  in the cr4 chimera is m2 419asn in o3,
whereas the essential residues for w84 are m2 177tyr in o2
and m2 423thr in tm7 (gnagey et al., 1999; buller et al.,
2002; voigtlander et al., 2003). thus, the binding selectivities
of these two ligands are dependent on different but nearby
residues, consistent with the finding that they seem to bind
to a common site (trankle and mohr, 1997). however, despite
this rather detailed knowledge concerning the residues that
seem to be responsible for the subtype selectivities of these
allosteric ligands, it has so far not been possible to replicate
their high m2-like potency by the substitution of a few amino
acids into the low-potency m5 structure.
because the known essential residues are in such close
proximity in the receptor structure, we believed that it would

[(pkapp ⫺ pkapp m5)/(pkapp m2 ⫺ pkapp m5)]. on this scale, m2 would
score 100% and m5 would score 0%; a mutation that reduced the
pkapp of m2 by one third of the m5/m2 span would score 67%, and a
mutation that increased the pkapp of m5 by one third of that span
would score 33% (table 1).

results
in this study, we systematically mutated a series of amino
acid residues in o2 and o3/tm7 regions of m2 or m5 receptors,
carried out [3h]nms dissociation assays to measure allosteric modulator potencies (apparent binding affinity, kapp), and
compared their individual roles in the binding and subtype
selectivities of  xxxd2174xxx  and w84. we used dissociation
assays for reasons that have been presented previously (ellis, 1997; ellis and seidenberg, 2000; buller et al., 2002). in
brief, a change in the dissociation rate of the labeled ligand is
a purely allosteric phenomenon that is not confounded by any
concomitant competitive interaction. in addition, the marked
slowing of the kinetics of the labeled ligand that is caused by
these allosteric modulators does not alter the rapid equilibration of the allosteric modulator, whereas the slow kinetics
of the labeled orthosteric ligand may be problematic in equilibrium (or pseudoequilibrium) experiments (m. seidenberg
and j. ellis, unpublished data).
the half-times of [3h]nms dissociation from each receptor
construct are reported in tables 1 to 3 and are consistent
with previous data (ellis et al., 1993) that m2 receptors have
short half times (fast dissociation) and m5 receptors have
long half-times (slow dissociation). buller et al. (2002) reported initially that the m2t423h mutant exhibits a significantly slower rate of [3h]nms dissociation compared with
the wild-type  xxxg448xxx . we also have observed that our m2
mutants, which included histidine at that position (and only
these m2 mutants), were more than 3-fold slower than the
wild-type receptor. furthermore, the converse mutation in
any of the m5 backgrounds, or in the cr3 chimera, induced
significantly faster dissociation compared with the parent
receptor.
residue m2423thr is equally important for both  xxxd2174xxx  and w84 binding. as illustrated in fig. 2,  xxxd2174xxx  has been found to be unique among many tested
allosteric ligands in that its potency is sensitive to epitopes
found in both cr4 and  xxxd1578xxx  but not in cr3; w84, like many

trations were determined using the advanced protein assay reagent
from cytoskeleton inc. (denver, co).
[3h]nms saturation binding assays. all binding assays, including dissociation assays (below), were carried out in 5 mm pb, ph
7.4, at 25°c. to determine receptor expression levels and binding
affinities for [3h]nms, membranes were incubated with 6 concentrations of [3h]nms (ranging from 3 to 1000 pm) in duplicate in a
final volume of 1 ml for 30 min. the reactions were terminated by
filtration onto 32 glass-fiber filters (s & s, keen, nh) pretreated
with ice-cold 0.1% polyethyleneimine solution and followed with two
washes with ice-cold 40 mm pb. radioactivity from membranes
trapped on filter discs was determined by liquid scintillation counting. data were fitted to a one-site hyperbolic binding curve with the
prism 4.0 software (graphpad software, inc., san diego, ca). nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 3 ␮m atropine at
each concentration point.
[3h]nms dissociation assays. dissociation assays were set up
and conducted as described previously (ellis and seidenberg, 2000;
buller et al., 2002). in brief, receptors (quantity of membrane protein
estimated to produce approximately 2000 dpm in total binding) were
first labeled with a saturating concentration of [3h]nms (1 nm) for
30 min in 1 ml. dissociation of [3h]nms was initiated by the addition
of atropine (3 ␮m, in a final volume of 2 ml), with or without the
indicated concentrations of allosteric modulators in duplicate and
was terminated by filtration after a period of time, which is typically
set between 2 and 3 times the standard half-time of [3h]nms dissociation (determined in the presence of atropine but in the absence of
any allosteric modulator), up to a maximum of 120 min for m5
receptor and some of its mutants.
dissociation assays were set up such that the delay of [3h]nms
dissociation was mediated by the binding of the allosteric modulator
to an allosteric site, separate from the orthosteric site at which
[3h]nms binds. the true dissociation rate constant (k0) was determined in the presence of 3 ␮m atropine without the allosteric modulator, and the apparent dissociation rate constant (kobs) was determined in the presence of both atropine and the allosteric modulator.
the ratios of kobs/k0 were then plotted against the logarithms of the
concentrations of allosteric modulator (x), and the resulting curve
was fitted (using prism 4.0 software) to the three-parameter logistic
function kobs/k0 ⫽ [bottom ⫹ (top ⫺ bottom)/(1 ⫹ 10(x ⫺ logec50)),
where top (constrained to 1.0 in curve-fitting) and bottom refer to
the upper and lower plateaus of the sigmoidal curve. the curve
represents the effect of allosteric delay of [3h]nms dissociation and
corresponds to the occupancy curve of the tested allosteric modulator
at the [3h]nms-occupied receptor (ellis and seidenberg, 1992; lazareno and birdsall, 1995). curve-fitting yielded ec50 values, which
correspond to equilibrium dissociation constants of the allosteric
modulator on the [3h]nms-occupied receptor, kapp. for convenient
comparison of effects of a given mutation on the binding of  xxxd2174xxx

the presence of asparagine at m2419 or m5474 leads
to complex effects on  xxxd2174xxx ’s potency but always
reduces the potency of w84. as stated above, residue
419
asn in the o3 loop has been found to be important for
 xxxd2174xxx ’s subtype selectivity (gnagey et al., 1999). in brief,
residues 523lys in m3 receptors and 474val in m5 receptors
are associated with significantly lower potency of  xxxd2174xxx ,
and acidic residues in m1 and m4 receptors are associated
with slightly higher potency of  xxxd2174xxx . furthermore, the
k523n mutation in m3 increased both the pkapp value toward  xxxd2174xxx  and also the negative cooperativity between
 xxxd2174xxx  and nms (krejci and tucek, 2001). all of these
data have led to the conclusion that residue 419asn is very
important in the binding of  xxxd2174xxx  and in its ability to
modulate the orthosteric site.
in light of the impact and proximity of 419asn and 423thr in
m2, we examined the effects of mutating each of these residues to their m5 counterparts. the reverse mutations were
also studied in the  xxxg451xxx , both individually and in
concert. in fig. 5a, it can be seen that the mutations
m5h478t and m5v474n produce similar effects, because
each construct exhibits significantly higher sensitivity for
 xxxd2174xxx  than does the wild-type  xxxg451xxx . however, the
enhancements are clearly not additive; indeed, the sensitiv-

other ligands, is sensitive to epitopes in cr3 and  xxxd1578xxx  but not
in cr4 (ellis and seidenberg, 2000; buller et al., 2002). the
residue in cr4 that confers specificity toward  xxxd2174xxx 
seems to be 419asn, whereas 423thr, which is included in  xxxd1578xxx 
but not in cr4, has been identified as the critical residue for
the selectivity of w84 (gnagey et al., 1999; buller et al.,
2002). the proximity of residues 419 and 423 (fig. 3a) led us
to examine  xxxd2174xxx ’s potency at the m2t423h mutant.
this substitution of the m5 residue reduced  xxxd2174xxx ’s potency significantly; additionally, the converse mutation,
m5h478t, significantly enhanced  xxxd2174xxx ’s potency (fig.
4). to facilitate comparison of the changes in the affinities of
 xxxd2174xxx  and w84 that are caused by receptor modification,
we expressed these changes as percentages of the m2–m5
span of potency for each ligand on a logarithmic scale (as
described under materials and methods). on this scale, the
m2t423h mutation reduces  xxxd2174xxx ’s potency by 31% and
reduces w84’s potency by 45%; the converse mutation in m5
enhances  xxxd2174xxx ’s potency by 41% and enhances w84’s
potency by 31% (table 1). similar degrees of enhancement
and reduction in affinities have been reported previously for
w84, dimethyl-w84, and diallylcaracurine v (buller et al.,
2002), indicating the importance of residue 423thr to these
structurally different muscarinic allosteric modulators.

ity of the double mutant is slightly lower than that of the
m5h478t single mutant. figure 5b shows a different pattern
of effects toward w84. as reported previously (voigtlander et
al., 2003), the m5h478t mutation significantly increases
sensitivity toward this ligand; however, the m5v474n mutation actually reduces sensitivity toward w84. these results
are summarized in table 1, along with data from additional
single mutations at the m2419asn site. inserting a positively
charged lysine residue produces almost as much decrement
in sensitivity toward w84 as toward  xxxd2174xxx . however,
w84 has significantly higher potency at the m2n419v mutant than it has at the wild-type  xxxg448xxx , which is in
agreement with the converse result in m5. thus, the potency
of w84 is attenuated by the presence of asparagine, whether
at m2419 or at m5474. perhaps more surprising is the finding
that  xxxd2174xxx  also has moderately higher potency at the

m2n419v mutant; nonetheless, this effect is consistent with
the attenuation by asparagine of the beneficial effect of the
threonine mutation in the  xxxg451xxx  (compare m5v474n,

residue m2177tyr is more important for w84 than
for  xxxd2174xxx . the mutation m2y177q (fig. 3b) has been
found to reduce the affinities for the nms-occupied receptor
of bis(ammonio)alkane-type (such as w84) and caracurine
v-type allosteric modulators; affinities are enhanced by the
reverse mutation m5q184y (voigtlander et al., 2003). our
experiments with w84 in receptors with mutations at this
residue were in good agreement with these previous data.
the mutation in m2 reduced the potency of w84 precipitously, decreasing more than 80% on our m2/m5 scale; the
converse mutation in m5 was less dramatic but still increased
the potency of w84 by 28% (table 2). in contrast,  xxxd2174xxx ’s
potency is reduced much less (15%) by the m2y177q mutation and is increased even less (7%) by the m5q184y mutation (fig. 6 and table 2).
it was noted previously that the potency of w84 is greatly
enhanced in a chimeric receptor that includes m2 sequence in
the o2 region (cr3; fig. 2), compared with its potency at the
wild-type  xxxg451xxx . figure 7 shows that this greatly increased potency is predominantly caused by the presence of
the tyrosine residue in that chimeric receptor, because the
construct that contains the other 144 residues of m2 sequence
but lacks the tyrosine actually has lower sensitivity for w84
than the wild-type  xxxg451xxx . in studies with w84, the
substitution of glutamine for tyrosine at this position,
whether in the wild-type  xxxg448xxx  or in the cr3 chimeric
receptor, produces a greater decrease in potency than any
other single-residue mutation in this study (table 2).
the impact of m2177tyr on w84 binding is caused by
the residue’s aromatic nature. molecular modeling studies have suggested that aromatic rings in diallylcaracurine v
or w84 interact with m2177tyr via ␲–␲ interactions (voigtlander et al., 2003). to test this suggestion experimentally,
we systematically replaced m2177tyr with residues containing different functional side chains. thus, in the  xxxg448xxx ,
we replaced the tyrosine with phenylalanine to retain the
aromatic ring, with serine to retain the hydroxyl group, or
with alanine to retain neither characteristic. figure 8 shows
that the m2y177a and m2y177s mutations reduced the receptor’s sensitivity toward w84 almost as much as the
m2y177q mutation did (table 2). however, the m2y177f
mutation caused a much smaller reduction in sensitivity
toward w84, as would be expected if a ␲–␲ interaction is the
important feature at that residue. it is interesting that all of

tion, suggesting that the aspartate residue (corresponding to
m2173asp) does not play a major role (gnagey et al., 1999),
leaving the  xxxd2431xxx  residues (m2172glu and 175glu)
for further investigation. the mutations m2e172l and
m2e175q reduced  xxxd2174xxx ’s pkapp by 10 and 17% and
w84’s pkapp by 7 and 12%, respectively. furthermore, the
combined mutations (m2e172l, e175q) produced reductions
in potency of  xxxd2174xxx  and w84 that were similar to the
edge-lagq mutation (fig. 9 and table 2). in the  xxxg451xxx , the residue corresponding to m2175glu is conserved (as
m5182glu), but the residue corresponding to m2172glu is a
proline (m5179pro). the mutation m2e172p reduced the potencies of  xxxd2174xxx  and w84 to similar extents, approximately 17% (table 2).
m2e172p mutation alters the conformation of
m2177tyr. one mechanism by which the m2e172p mutation
could exert a reduction in the potency of w84 would be via a
change in the conformation of nearby residue 177tyr that
might disrupt the ␲–␲ interaction between 177tyr and w84.
this mechanism would also explain why the introduction of
the tyrosine residue in m5q184y might be under an unfavorable conformation for w84 binding, which in turn would
explain why the enhancement caused by this mutation is so
much less than the decrement observed with the m2y177q
mutation (table 2). if this explanation is correct, then additional mutations upstream of the inserted tyrosine might
facilitate the interaction with w84. to test this possibility,
we introduced the m2 glutamate into m5 in place of the
proline. the m5p179e mutation had virtually no effect by
itself on w84 binding, but it significantly potentiated the
ability of q184y to increase the potency of w84 from 28 to
60% greater than its potency at m5 (fig. 10 and table 2). this
mechanism is unlikely to apply to  xxxd2174xxx , however, because  xxxd2174xxx ’s potency is so much less sensitive to
m2177tyr. indeed, although the m5p179e mutation significantly enhanced the potency of  xxxd2174xxx , there was no potentiation when the q184y mutation was added (compare
 xxxd2174xxx  at m5p179e versus m5p179e, q184y in table 2).
effects of combining mutations in the o2 and o3/tm7
regions. the preceding studies have identified four epitopes
that distinguish the  xxxg448xxx  from the  xxxg451xxx  and

but did not increase  xxxd2174xxx ’s potency relative to m5 (ellis
et al., 1993). the explanation for these divergent results
seemed to be that the  xxxg451xxx  also has acidic residues in
the corresponding motif (plde) that were also important
(perhaps equally important) for  xxxd2174xxx  binding (gnagey
et al., 1999; sequence alignments are shown in fig. 3b).
however, the roles of individual residues in the edge motif
have not been investigated; therefore, in this study, we have
investigated single amino acid mutations at strategic sites in
this region. in particular, we mutated residues within the
edge motif to the corresponding m1 residues and/or m5
residues to evaluate their roles in the binding and subtype
selectivities of  xxxd2174xxx  (and w84). the rationale for using
m1 as well as m5 residues is that the  xxxg447xxx  is the only
subtype with no acidic residues in the corresponding motif
(lagq); the  xxxg451xxx  maintains two acidic residues in the
corresponding motif (plde), even though m5 has the lowest
sensitivity toward either  xxxd2174xxx  or w84 among the
machr subtypes.
as expected from previous studies (gnagey et al., 1999),
the mutation edge-lagq, which removed all three acidic
residues, reduced  xxxd2174xxx ’s pkapp by 42%; the same mutation also reduced w84’s potency, albeit to a lesser extent
(26%; fig. 9 and table 2). in the edge-lagq (m2/m1) mutation, residue m2174gly is retained, but the other three
individual mutations remove three negatively charged residues. previous studies have found that  xxxd2174xxx ’s potency
at the  xxxg450xxx  is unaffected by the pdnq-lagq muta-

lamine than the quadruple mutant, even higher than the
cr3h478t mutant, increasing 74% on the relative scale
between m5 and m2 pkapp. the potency of w84 was enhanced
to an even greater extent than that of  xxxd2174xxx  in these
triple and quadruple m5 mutants; indeed, the sensitivity of
the triple mutant for w84 actually surpassed that of m2 (fig.
13b and table 3).

discussion
the aim of this investigation was to examine the differences between the epitopes involved in the subtype selectivity of  xxxd2174xxx  and w84, which represent structurally divergent muscarinic allosteric agents. before this study, the
existing data suggested that although these ligands interacted at a common allosteric site (trankle and mohr 1997),
the residues responsible for their subtype selectivities were
distinct. w84 has recently been thoroughly characterized and
shown to require 177tyr in the o2 loop and 423thr at the top
of tm7 for its high potency at the  xxxg448xxx , relative to m5
(voigtlander et al., 2003). the m2/m5 selectivity of  xxxd2174xxx 
has been attributed to m2419asn in the o3 loop and to a
negatively charged sequence (edge) in the m2-o2 loop (leppik et al., 1994; gnagey et al., 1999), but individual residues
in this region of the o2 loop had not been thoroughly characterized. here, we have found that  xxxd2174xxx  and w84 are
approximately equally dependent on m2423thr for high potency, that the orientation of m2177tyr is crucial to the selectivity of w84 and can be modulated by nearby upstream
residues, that  xxxd2174xxx ’s high potency apparently relies
more on the negative charge in o2 than on the aromatic

glu of the edge motif and 177tyr. the chimera cr3
possesses the entire o2 loop from the  xxxg448xxx  (fig. 2) but
does not contain the 419asn or 423thr of m2. therefore, we
examined the allosteric effects of  xxxd2174xxx  and w84 on cr3
receptors with the single or combined mutations v474n and
h478t. for w84, the effects of the additional mutations were
similar in cr3 and m5. the histidine-to-threonine mutation
enhanced potency, although in a somewhat less than additive
manner, and resulted in a potency that was close to that of
w84 at m2 (compare cr3 h478t in table 3 with m5h478t
and cr3 in tables 1 and 3, respectively). this result is
similar to that of a previous study (buller et al., 2002). the
valine-to-asparagine mutation had a negative effect in every
case, and, again, the effect was similar to the results obtained
in m5; the reductions in potency of w84 were approximately
additive, in that the presence of the asparagine reduced the
gains in potency caused by the cr3 or h478t manipulations
by approximately the same amount that it reduced the potency of w84 in m5 itself (tables 1 and 3). the effects of these
mutations on the potency of  xxxd2174xxx  were more complex.
the m2 sequence in cr3 did not enhance  xxxd2174xxx ’s potency
very much, but it acted synergistically with the histidine-tothreonine mutation to yield a supra-additive gain in potency
(compare figs. 5a and 11, and tables 1 and 3). the valineto-asparagine mutation, by contrast, was less than additive
with the effect of cr3; however, the inclusion of this asparagine did not reduce the cr3-threonine synergy.
compared with the m5v474n, h478t mutant (table 1),
the cr3 v474n, h478t mutant (table 3) increased  xxxd2174xxx ’s pkapp by 0.66 log unit and that of w84 by 0.95 log
unit. a major difference between these two mutants is the o2
loop of the  xxxg448xxx . from the studies presented above, we
expected that the p179e and q184y mutations were dominant in producing the effects of the o2 loop in the cr3
chimeric constructs. therefore, we created two quadruple
mutants, the m5p179e, q184y, v474n, h478t mutant and
the converse construct in m2, in which the corresponding four
residues were replaced by their m5 counterparts. these mutations in the  xxxg448xxx  reduced its sensitivities toward
 xxxd2174xxx  and w84 dramatically, nearly to m5 levels (fig. 12
and table 3). confirming the importance of these residues,
the m5 quadruple mutant showed significantly higher sensitivity toward  xxxd2174xxx  than m5 (fig. 13a and table 3).
remembering the frequently deleterious effects of the o3
419
asn, we also tested the triple mutant m5p179e, q184y,
h478t; it showed slightly higher sensitivity toward gal-

mutation without v474n) were constructed and assessed for allosteric
actions of  xxxd2174xxx  (a) and w84 (b). m2 and m5 curves are included for

receptors; however, when m2423thr is removed or replaced
with histidine, then m2419asn becomes important for  xxxd2174xxx  binding. these data indicate that the role of 419asn is
more complicated and less important in the binding of  xxxd2174xxx  to the m2 subtype than earlier studies had suggested.
in the case of w84, the data are not so complex, because the
presence of that asparagine residue reduces w84’s potency
whether it is in the m2 or m5 context.
similar to the situation at m2419asn, the residues at the
position corresponding to m2423thr are unique in each subtype of machrs. as noted above and in previous studies, the
histidine in the m5 subtype is associated with low sensitivity
for caracurine derivatives and dimethyl-w84 (as well as  xxxd2174xxx  and w84), whereas the serine in the m4 subtype
seems to be functionally equivalent to the threonine residue
(buller et al., 2002). thus, it seems that both m2419asn and
m2423thr (and their corresponding residues in other subtypes) are important in generating subtype selectivity, but
the threonine residue is the dominant feature of the o3/tm7
region for the subtype selectivity of both  xxxd2174xxx  and w84.
the importance of these two positions in the receptor may be
related to the fact that, if the region containing these residues is helical, their side groups will be adjacent on the same
face of the helix. in addition, both 419asn and 423thr seem to
be involved in mechanisms of cooperativity between nms
and several allosteric ligands, especially when comparisons
are drawn between the m2 and  xxxg449xxx  subtypes (krejci
and tucek, 2001; jakubik et al., 2005).
in the o2 region, there seems to be no doubt that m2177tyr
is the most important residue in the subtype-selective binding of w84, as reported previously (voigtlander et al., 2003).
in the present study, we have shown that the dramatic increase in sensitivity toward w84 that is seen in the chimeric
receptor named cr3, relative to m5 sensitivity, is completely
lost if just that tyrosine is excluded from the 145 amino acid
exchange (fig. 7 and table 2). subsequent mutations at
position 177 also supported the suggestion that there is a
␲–␲ interaction between w84 and the tyrosine phenol ring,
because phenylalanine was a much better substitute for that
tyrosine than serine or alanine (or glutamine).
with regard to the potency of w84, we have suggested
previously that the proline at position 179 in m5 might interfere with the proper alignment of the tyrosine residue in
m5 mutants that include the q184y mutation (voigtlander et
al., 2003), and that now seems to be the case. that is,
whereas the p179e mutation leaves the sensitivity toward
w84 almost unaffected, relative to m5, it greatly potentiates
the effect of the tyrosine insertion at position 184 (fig. 10 and
table 2). for  xxxd2174xxx , it seems that the negative charge
within the edge motif is the most important factor in o2 and
that the glutamates at positions 172 and 175 are the most
important residues. however, the chimera cr3 contains the
glutamate corresponding to m2172glu instead of proline yet
does not have much better sensitivity toward  xxxd2174xxx  than
m5 itself, suggesting that there must also be features within
the m2 sequence of cr3 that neutralize the expected gain in
sensitivity; indeed,  xxxd2174xxx  has significantly higher potency for m5p179e, q184y than it has for cr3.
when mutations in the o2 and o3/tm7 regions are combined, some additional small synergies may be noted. for
 xxxd2174xxx , the substitution of threonine for histidine within
the cr3 context produces a greater gain in potency than the

nature of m2177tyr, and that the role of m2419asn is more
complex than earlier studies had suggested.
the evidence pointing to m2419asn in  xxxd2174xxx ’s subtype
selectivity originated from studies in which a smaller or
larger segment of the  xxxg451xxx  was replaced with m2
sequence (see cr4 and  xxxd1578xxx  in fig. 2). the chimera  xxxd1578xxx 
includes both m2419asn and m2423thr, whereas cr4 contains only m2419asn. because the two chimeric constructs
showed similar sensitivity toward  xxxd2174xxx  and the larger
segment included the smaller one completely, it was assumed
that the essential residue resided within the smaller segment. subsequent investigations found that the sensitivity of
the  xxxg451xxx  (and m3 as well) toward  xxxd2174xxx  was
significantly enhanced when they contained an asparagine
residue at the position corresponding to m2419 (gnagey et al.,
1999). however, inspection of fig. 2 reveals that the larger
substitution of  xxxd1578xxx  leads to higher sensitivity toward  xxxd2174xxx  than does the smaller substitution of cr4, in much
the same way that the double mutant m5v474n, h478t
compares with m5v474n (fig. 5a), probably indicating that
the slightly higher  xxxd2174xxx  potency at  xxxd1578xxx  (compared with
cr4) is significant and that it represents the nonadditive
effects of v474n and h478t on  xxxd2174xxx ’s potency. overall,
it seems that this asparagine residue is beneficial to sensitivity toward  xxxd2174xxx  when the threonine is absent but not
when that threonine is present. in other words, m2419asn
plays a minor role or even a negative role in m2 wild-type

corresponding mutation in the  xxxg451xxx  itself (i.e.,
h478t). on the other hand, insertion of that threonine into
the m5p179e, q184y produces just an additive effect (table
3). it is as though the threonine residue relieves the unidentified negative influence in cr3 (referred to above). for w84,
the situation is reversed, with the histidine-to-threonine mutation and the cr3 substitution being essentially additive,
but the insertion of the threonine into m5p179e, q184y
yielding a greater than additive effect; indeed, this triple
mutant has slightly higher sensitivity than m2 itself toward
w84. the source of these small inter-regional synergies is not
immediately apparent. in any event, this is the first report of
high potency of a muscarinic allosteric ligand (i.e., w84)
being so fully recreated by three discrete mutations in the
low-potency background of the m5 subtype.
a number of studies have suggested that the o2 and o3
loops (plus several residues predicted to lie in the extracellular ends of tms 6 and 7) can modulate the conformation of
machr structure. liu et al. (1995) found that a threonine at
the position corresponding to m2423 interfered with proper
helix-helix packing in some recombinant receptor constructs
(buller et al., 2002). we have noted that the presence or
absence of a threonine at this same position modulates the
kinetics with which nms binds to the receptor (see results
and half-times in tables 1 and 3). extending the observations
of spalding et al. (1995, 1997) at the  xxxg451xxx , ford et al.
(2002) found that homologous mutations near the o3/tm6
junction constitutively activate all of the five machr subtypes. in o2, endogenous antibodies that bind to this loop
region can activate the  xxxg448xxx  (goin et al., 1999; baba et
al., 2004), and a monoclonal antibody fragment generated
against a smaller peptide that still includes the edge motif
displays  xxxd1422xxx  activity (peter et al., 2004).
in summary, we now have a more detailed explanation of
the source of the relative affinities of the allosteric agents
w84 and  xxxd2174xxx  for the nms-bound forms of the m2 and
m5 machrs. the affinities of these two ligands benefit from
a common feature, namely the threonine residue found near
the junction of the o3 and tm7 in the  xxxg448xxx . in addition, w84 interacts with a tyrosine residue in the o2 loop; the
orientation of this residue is crucial to allow for an optimal
␲–␲ interaction with the ligand and may be modulated by
nearby residues. the potency of  xxxd2174xxx  seems to be influenced more by nearby negative charges than by the aromatic
tyrosine residue. thus, the subtype-selective features of the
common allosteric site seem to reside in these two extracellular regions of the receptor.
