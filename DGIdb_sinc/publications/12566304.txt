abstract
colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the united
states. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including  xxxd3259xxx  are promising chemopreventive agents for colorectal cancer.  xxxd3259xxx  and selective
cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 inhibitors cause regression of colonic polyps in
familial polyposis patients.  xxxd3259xxx  induces apoptotic cell death in cancer
cells in vitro and in vivo. in tumor cells, activation of extracellular-regulated
kinase (erk) 1/2 results in phosphorylation of several  xxxg1369xxx /2 effectors,
including the proapoptotic protein bad. phosphorylation of ser112 by
 xxxg1369xxx /2 inactivates bad and protects the tumor cell from apoptosis.
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
selectively inhibit  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation in human colon cancer cells.
in this study we show that  xxxg681xxx  (egf) strongly
induces phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 and bad in ht29 colon cancer cells.
egf-stimulated phosphorylation of erk and bad is blocked by pretreatment with  xxxd3462xxx , a selective map kinase kinase (mkk)1/2 inhibitor.
similarly, pretreatment with  xxxd3260xxx  blocks the ability of egf to
induce  xxxg1369xxx /2 and bad phosphorylation, but also down-regulates total
bad but not  xxxg1369xxx /2 protein levels. the ability of  xxxd3259xxx  to block
 xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling by the egf receptor may account for at least part of its
potent growth-inhibitory effects against cancer cells.

introduction
crc3 is the second most common cause of cancer death in the
united states with 148,300 cases and 56,600 deaths in 2001 (1).
epidemiological evidence suggests that regular use of nsaids such
as aspirin or  xxxd3259xxx  is associated with a decreased death rate for
crc and a lower prevalence of colorectal adenomas (2). in patients
with fap, several studies have shown that  xxxd3259xxx  treatment causes
marked regression of existing colonic polyps and prevents formation
of new polyps (3–7). more recently, the selective cox-2 inhibitor
celecoxib has been reported to cause a modest regression of colonic
adenomas in patients with fap (8).  xxxd3259xxx , non-cox-inhibiting
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites, and selective cox-2 inhibitors all prevent tumor formation in a variety of animal models of crc (9 –12). the
regression of neoplasms by  xxxd3259xxx  is a striking example of
the potential for a chemopreventive agent to inhibit and even reverse
the process of carcinogenesis.
whereas evidence supporting the ability of  xxxd3259xxx  to inhibit
tumor formation is strong, the biochemical mechanisms by which
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites cause growth inhibition are not clear. nsaids
are defined by their ability to enzymatically inhibit the activity of

cox-1 and -2 proteins. cox-1 is constitutively expressed in many
normal tissues, whereas cox-2 expression is normally absent but can
be induced by various stimuli including growth factors. cox-2, but
not cox-1, is overexpressed in colonic adenomas and crc (13).
cox enzymes convert  xxxd208xxx  to prostaglandins, which
contribute to neoplastic progression by stimulating cell division, motility, and angiogenesis (13).
in addition to cox inhibition, other biochemical targets have been
suggested for  xxxd3259xxx , including  xxxg1369xxx /2 (14),  xxxd1274xxx -dependent phosphodiesterase (15), nuclear factor ␬b (16), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ␦ (17), and c-jun nh2-terminal kinase
(18). we described recently the ability of both  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites to
inhibit phosphorylation and activity of  xxxg1369xxx /2 at times and doses
consistent with induction of apoptotic cell death (14). we found that
inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling alone is sufficient to induce apoptosis
in human colon cancer cells (14). use of a selective  xxxg1361xxx /2 inhibitor
in vivo inhibits growth of human colon tumor xenografts (19), indicating that inhibition of the  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling pathway alone is
sufficient to block tumor growth. activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 in neoplastic
cells results in phosphorylation of downstream effectors that inhibit
apoptosis and stimulate cell proliferation. in some cell systems,
 xxxg1369xxx /2-dependent phosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein bad
at serine 112 results in dissociation of bad from bcl-2 and  xxxg251xxx ,
allowing these antiapoptotic proteins to prevent mitochondrial events
required for apoptosis (20).
several lines of evidence indicate that egfr signaling is important
in crc progression. ligands that activate the egfr, including egf
and tgf-␣, are known to stimulate proliferation of both normal and
neoplastic intestinal epithelial cells (21). in intestinal epithelial cells,
signaling via the  xxxg1361xxx /2- xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway is required for the
growth-promoting effects of tgf-␣ (22) and activated ras (23, 24).
the min mouse carries a germ-line mutation of apc (adenomatous
polyposis coli), the same gene mutated in the human disease, fap.
the min mouse spontaneously develops numerous intestinal polyps
and is a model for human fap. targeted deletion of the egfr on a
min mouse background dramatically reduces the incidence of intestinal polyps (25), suggesting that egfr signaling is required for
adenoma formation in this model. combination therapy using
nsaids and egfr blockers has a synergistic effect over either
compound alone in the min model (26). based in part on this preclinical date, egfr antibodies are currently being used clinically for
the treatment of crc (27).
the ability of nsaids to inhibit some aspects of egfr activity has
been described previously.  xxxd3260xxx  and indomethacin both
inhibit tgf-␣ induced prostaglandin production and thymidine incorporation in rie-1 cells (21), indicating that nsaids can modulate an
activity of the egfr. in addition, indomethacin, ibuprofen, and
aspirin all block egf-induced ca2⫹ influx in caco-2 cells (28). the
biochemical mechanisms by which nsaids might interact with
egfr signaling were not addressed in these studies.
on the basis of these reports, we hypothesized that  xxxd3259xxx  inhibits
the pro-proliferative and antiapoptotic effects of egfr activation in
colon cancer cells by down-regulating  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation and
downstream signaling. in this paper we describe the ability of egf to

 xxxd3259xxx  inhibits egf phosphorylation of erk and bad

induce phosphorylation of  xxxg1361xxx /2,  xxxg1369xxx /2, and bad(ser112) in
human colon cancer cells. we show that bad(ser112) phosphorylation
by egf is mediated by  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling.  xxxd3260xxx , in addition to inhibiting basal  xxxg1361xxx /2,  xxxg1369xxx /2, and bad(ser112) phosphorylation, also blocks egf-induced activation of  xxxg1361xxx /2,  xxxg1369xxx /2,
and bad(ser112). unexpectedly,  xxxd3260xxx  also led to a decrease in total bad protein, but not  xxxg1369xxx /2 or  xxxg1361xxx /2. inhibition of
total bad protein expression is not dependent on  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibition
and may be related to the effects of  xxxd3259xxx  on other signaling
pathways. together these results additionally support inhibition of
egfr signaling as a major biochemical mechanism of action for
 xxxd3259xxx .

materials and methods

results
egf induces phosphorylation of  xxxg1361xxx /2,  xxxg1369xxx /2, and bad in
ht29 human colon cancer cells. ht29 human colon cancer cells
were grown to confluency in medium containing 10% fetal bovine
serum then switched to serum-free medium for 24 h before addition of
egf. after 24 h in serum-free medium, addition of 10 –100 ng/ml
egf to the culture medium induced phosphorylation of  xxxg1361xxx /2,
 xxxg1369xxx /2, and bad(ser112) proteins after 5 and 30 min of treatment,
and the induction was no longer present at 24 h (fig. 1). maximal
phosphorylation of  xxxg1361xxx /2 and  xxxg1369xxx /2 was seen at 5 min after egf
treatment, whereas phosphorylation of bad(ser112) was equivalent at
5 and 30 min. expression of total  xxxg1361xxx /2,  xxxg1369xxx /2, and bad proteins
was not increased by egf treatment (fig. 1). these results indicate
that egf stimulates phosphorylation of the  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling cascade, without similarly effecting total protein expression. egf, at
concentrations from 1–100 ng/ml, consistently induced  xxxg1361xxx /2,
 xxxg1369xxx /2, and bad(ser112) phosphorylation from 5 to 60 min after
treatment in ht29 cells (fig. 1; data not shown).
 xxxd3260xxx  blocks egf-induced phosphorylation of
 xxxg1361xxx /2,  xxxg1369xxx /2, and bad proteins.  xxxd3260xxx  and  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfone inhibit basal levels of phospho- xxxg1361xxx /2 and phosphoerk1/2 at times and doses consistent with induction of apoptotic cell
death (14). we next determined whether pretreatment with  xxxd3259xxx 
could prevent egf-induced phosphorylation of the  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling
cascade. ht29 cells were grown to confluency and serum-deprived
for 24 h before drug treatment. treatment with 10 ng/ml of egf
induced phosphorylation of  xxxg1361xxx /2,  xxxg1369xxx /2, and bad(ser112) after
5 min of treatment (fig. 2). pretreatment of ht29 cells for 24 h with
80 ␮m  xxxd3260xxx , the nsaid metabolite of  xxxd3259xxx , inhibited
basal  xxxg1361xxx /2 and  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation, and blocked the ability
of egf to induce phosphorylation of  xxxg1361xxx /2,  xxxg1369xxx /2, and
bad(ser112) proteins (fig. 2). the basal expression of phosphobad(ser112) was relatively low in ht29 cells, but  xxxd3260xxx 
inhibited expression of phospho-bad(ser112) additionally.  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide treatment did not significantly affect levels of total  xxxg1361xxx /2 or
 xxxg1369xxx /2 proteins (fig. 2). in contrast, expression of total bad protein
was dramatically inhibited after 24 h of  xxxd3260xxx  treatment.
treatment with 80 ␮m  xxxd3260xxx  induced apoptotic cell death,
as determined by examining nuclear morphology after staining with
acridine orange and ethidium bromide, and cleavage of caspase-3

materials. cell culture medium and fetal bovine serum were purchased
from mediatech (herndon, va), antibiotic/antimycotic solution (penicillin/
streptomycin/ xxxd164xxx ) from life technologies, inc. (grand island, ny), and
tissue culture plates from falcon (franklin lakes, nj). primary antibodies
raised against phosphorylated  xxxg1369xxx /2 and total  xxxg1369xxx /2 were from santa cruz
biotechnology (santa cruz, ca); primary antibodies against phosphorylated
 xxxg1361xxx /2, total  xxxg1361xxx /2, phosphorylated bad(ser112), total bad, and cleaved
caspase-3 were from cell signaling technology (beverly, ma). horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated antimouse, antigoat, and antirabbit secondary antibodies were from santa cruz biotechnology; immobilon-p membranes were
obtained from millipore (bedford, ma), chemiluminescent visualization reagents from nen (boston, ma), and x-ray film from pierce (rockford, il).
 xxxd3260xxx , the  xxxg1361xxx /2 inhibitor ( xxxd3462xxx ), and caspase inhibitor iii
[boc-asp(ome)-ch2f] were from calbiochem (san diego, ca).
tissue culture. ht29, hct116, and sw480 human colon cancer cells
were purchased from american type culture collection (manassas, va), and
maintained in rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin/ xxxd164xxx  solution. medium was replaced two to three
times per week, and cells were passaged at subconfluency. the cells were
grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% co2-95% air. cells were plated and
grown to 80 –100% confluency before treatment.
morphological apoptosis assay. apoptosis and viability were quantified
as described previously (14), by staining cells with acridine orange and
ethidium bromide, then assaying for nuclear morphology, a hallmark of apoptosis. for each determination, adherent and floating cells were harvested
together, and three separate 100 cell counts were scored. apoptosis was
expressed as a percentage calculated from the number of cells with apoptotic
nuclear morphology divided by the total number of cells examined.
western immunoblotting. for western blot analysis, cells were scraped
from plates, pelleted, resuspended in lysis buffer [15 mm tris; 2 mm edta; 50
mm  xxxd26xxx ; 20% glycerol; 0.1% triton x-100; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1 mm sodium fluoride; 1 mm sodium orthovanadate; and 1
␮g/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin (ph 7.5)], incubated 10 min on
ice, then sonified for 12 s on ice. lysates were centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 rpm
(14,000 ⫻ g) for 10 min at 4°c, and supernatant collected. protein concentrations were determined by the method of richter et al. (29). lysates were
prepared for sds-page, and 50 ␮g total protein separated and electrotransferred overnight onto immobilon-p polyvinylidene difluoride membranes
(millipore). nonspecific binding was blocked for 30 min in tris-neutral saline
with 1% (w/v) dry milk and 0.05% tween 20, then incubated with phosphoerk1/2 (1 ␮g/ml), phospho- xxxg1361xxx /2 (1:5,000), phospho-bad(ser112;
1:1000), or cleaved caspase-3 (1:1,000) primary antibodies overnight while
rocking at 4°c. immunoreactive protein was detected by incubating blots with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h followed by
chemiluminescent substrate for 1 min. immunoreactive proteins were visualized by exposure to radiographic film. in some experiments, the membranes
were stripped for 30 min in 10% sds, 67 mm tris (ph 6.7), and 0.8%
 xxxd26xxx  while rocking at 50°c, and washed twice for 10 min each
in tns with 0.05% tween 20. blots were then reblocked and probed with

were harvested 5 min after egf treatment and lysates prepared for western immunoblotting.

as well as cytosolic bad (data not shown), indicating loss of total
cellular bad protein.
to determine whether inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 and bad phosphorylation, and loss of total bad protein were consequences of caspase
activation in cells undergoing apoptosis, sw480 cells were pretreated
for 60 min with 25 ␮m caspase inhibitor iii [boc-asp(ome)-ch2f]
before addition of 200 ␮m  xxxd3260xxx . at this dose,  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide induced apoptotic cell death, as shown by cleavage of
caspase-3 (fig. 4), and confirmed by nuclear morphology after staining cells with acridine orange and ethidium bromide (data not shown).
similar to ht29 colon cancer cells, sw480 cells treated with apoptotic concentrations of  xxxd3260xxx  had dramatically reduced
expression of phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2, phospho-bad(ser112), and total bad
proteins (fig. 4). pretreatment with 25 ␮m caspase inhibitor iii
blocked caspase-3 cleavage (fig. 4) and morphological apoptosis
(data not shown) induced by  xxxd3260xxx . however, pretreatment
with caspase inhibitor iii did not prevent loss of phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2,
phospho-bad(ser112), or total bad protein expression (fig. 4), indicating that these biochemical events are not a consequence of caspase
cleavage.

(data not shown), consistent with our previous report (14). treatment
with egf had no effect on morphological apoptosis or caspase-3
cleavage induced by  xxxd3260xxx  (data not shown). the ability of
 xxxd3260xxx  to inhibit  xxxg1361xxx /2,  xxxg1369xxx /2, and bad(ser112) phosphorylation, as well as total bad protein was also observed in other
colon cancer cell lines, including hct116 and sw480 (data not
shown). in each of these cell lines,  xxxd3260xxx  induced apoptotic
cell death at times and doses consistent with down-regulation of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling and inhibition of bad protein expression.
the  xxxg1361xxx /2 inhibitor,  xxxd3462xxx , blocks egf-induced phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 and bad proteins. we reported previously that
treatment of colon cancer cells with  xxxd3462xxx , a selective inhibitor of
 xxxg1361xxx /2, potently inhibits  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation and induces apoptotic cell death, indicating that inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 alone is
sufficient to induce apoptosis of colon cancer cells (14). to determine
whether  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation mediates egf-induced phosphorylation
of bad(ser112), ht29 cells were pretreated with 10 ␮m  xxxd3462xxx  for 60
min before addition of 10 ng/ml egf. as seen in figure 3,  xxxd3462xxx 
pretreatment inhibited basal and egf-induced phosphorylation of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 and bad(ser112), but not  xxxg1361xxx /2 ( xxxd3462xxx  inhibits  xxxg1361xxx /2
activity but not its phosphorylation).  xxxd3462xxx  and egf treatment did
not affect expression of total  xxxg1361xxx /2,  xxxg1369xxx /2, or bad at these time
points. loss of total bad protein, as seen after  xxxd3260xxx 
treatment, did not occur even after 1–3 days of  xxxd3462xxx  treatment, at
doses that are sufficient to induce caspase cleavage and morphological
apoptosis (data not shown).
loss of total bad protein is not a consequence of caspase
activation. treatment with apoptotic concentrations of  xxxd3260xxx  for 24 h led to loss of total bad protein as well as egf-induced
bad phosphorylation (fig. 2). the decrease in total bad protein
expression after  xxxd3260xxx  treatment was an unexpected result.
to confirm this result, we performed western immunoblotting of
 xxxd3260xxx -treated cells using an antibody raised against fulllength bad protein (santa cruz biotechnology) and found the same
result (data not shown). because bad can colocalize at the mitochondrial membrane, we also examined particulate samples for membrane
translocation of bad. whereas bad protein was detected in these
particulate samples,  xxxd3260xxx  caused loss of membrane-bound

 xxxd3259xxx  inhibits egf phosphorylation of erk and bad

discussion
we have reported previously that  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites inhibit basal
 xxxg1361xxx /2 and  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation, and that inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2
is sufficient to induce apoptotic cell death (14). the results presented
in this paper confirm the ability of nsaids to inhibit  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling in colon cancer cells and link this effect to the egfr signaling
pathway. we found that egf stimulates phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2
and bad(ser112) in colon cancer cells, a prosurvival pathway in other
cell types. egf-induced phosphorylation of bad(ser112) was dependent on  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation.
substantial evidence exists linking egfr signaling to the process
of colonic carcinogenesis. our results suggest that egf activates a
prosurvival pathway in colon cancer cells by inhibiting bad(ser112)
phosphorylation. egf receptors are present on both normal and neoplastic colonic cells, and overexpression of egf receptor agonists
including egf and tgf-␣ is thought to contribute to colon cancer
progression (21). as a result, the egfr has become a biochemical
target for chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents against colon cancer. treatment of human colon cancer xenografts with the
 xxxd1256xxx  eki-785 produced a dose-dependent inhibition of
tumor growth in nude mice (25). transfer of the apc(min) allele onto
a homozygous egfr(knockout) background resulted in a 90% reduction in intestinal polyp number relative to apc(min) mice carrying a
wild-type egfr allele (25). combination therapy using both an
egfr antagonist and  xxxd3259xxx  inhibited polyp growth in min mice to
a greater extent than either agent alone (26). it has been suggested that
this synergistic effect is because of the combination of down-regulation of cox-2 expression by egfr blockade and inhibition of
cox-2 activity by nsaids. our results suggest an alternative or
additional reason for such synergy. we found that  xxxd3260xxx 
strongly inhibits egf-induced activation of  xxxg1361xxx /2 and  xxxg1369xxx /2.
thus, the combination of an egfr antagonist and an nsaid may
provide additive inhibition of the same signaling pathway.
activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 leads to phosphorylation of several downstream effectors, including protein kinases and transcription factors
responsible for regulating genes that enhance cell proliferation and
protect from apoptosis (30).  xxxg1369xxx /2-dependent phosphorylation of
transcription factors, including c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc, has been
directly linked to promotion of cell proliferation (30). the biochemical links between  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling and prevention of apoptosis are
less well defined. our results suggest that one biochemical link may
be regulation of the activity of bad, one of the bcl-2 family members.
the bcl-2 family proteins can be roughly divided into proapoptotic
(bad, bax, and bak) and antiapoptotic (bcl-2 and  xxxg251xxx ) members.
the function of the proapoptotic members is to bind to the antiapoptotic members, which facilitates binding to mitochondrial membranes, pore formation, loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential,
release of  xxxg569xxx , and activation of caspases (31). it was first
shown in mc/9 and fd-cp1 cells that  xxxg1361xxx /2 signaling could
mediate phosphorylation of bad at ser112 (20). phosphorylation at
ser112 inactivates bad by sequestering it in the cytosol and preventing its dimerization with  xxxg251xxx  (20). we describe the ability of
 xxxd3260xxx  to inhibit egf-mediated phosphorylation of
bad(ser112) in human colon cancer cells.  xxxd3260xxx  also inhibited basal levels of bad(ser112) phosphorylation. inhibition of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 activity by  xxxd3462xxx  was sufficient to block egf-induced
phosphorylation of bad(ser112). thus, our data suggest that  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide blocks bad phosphorylation by inhibiting  xxxg1361xxx /2 and
 xxxg1369xxx /2.
the inhibition of bad(ser112) phosphorylation by  xxxd3260xxx 
is consistent with induction of apoptosis, as phosphorylation at this
site inhibits bad and protects cells from apoptosis (31, 32). however,

the decrease in total bad protein expression by  xxxd3260xxx  was an
unexpected result, as overexpression of dephosphorylated bad has
been shown to enhance apoptosis in several cell lines (33, 34). we are
unaware of previous evidence for the ability of an apoptotic-inducing
agent, such as  xxxd3259xxx , to inhibit protein expression of bad. the
coexistence of down-regulation of both phospho-bad(ser112) and
total bad protein expression by  xxxd3260xxx  is predicted to have
opposing effects on apoptosis. because of these conflicting results, the
relevance of phospho-bad expression, in relation to induction of
apoptotic cell death of colon cancer cells by  xxxd3259xxx , is open to
question. future studies will examine the time course of phosphobad(ser112) and total bad expression to determine when these
changes occur after  xxxd3259xxx  treatment.
decreased expression of total bad protein does not occur when
colon cancer cells are treated with concentrations of  xxxd3462xxx  that
induce apoptosis, and down-regulate phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 and phosphobad(ser112) expression, even after 1–3 days of drug treatment.4
therefore, inhibition of total bad protein expression is an erkindependent mechanism of  xxxd3259xxx , and may be related to the effects
of  xxxd3259xxx  on other signaling pathways, such as protein kinase g15 or
c-jun nh2-terminal kinase (18). it is possible that  xxxd3259xxx  inhibits
transcription or translation of bad, or perhaps induces bad degradation by noncaspase-dependent proteolysis. the function of the bad
protein is regulated by phosphorylation of residues in addition to
ser112. phosphorylation at ser112, ser136, or ser155 inhibits the
proapoptotic activity of bad by preventing it from binding and sequestering proapoptotic proteins such as  xxxg251xxx . more recently a
separate bad phosphorylation site was identified at ser128 (35).
phosphorylation at ser128 enhances the proapoptotic activity of bad,
even when bad is phosphorylated at ser136, an antiapoptotic site (35).
 xxxd3259xxx  may induce changes in one or more of the phosphorylation
sites of bad before induction of the apoptotic machinery.
whereas this is the first report indicating that  xxxd3260xxx 
inhibits bad phosphorylation and total protein expression, nsaids
including  xxxd3259xxx  have been shown to affect other bcl-2 family
members.  xxxd3260xxx  and indomethacin inhibit expression of the
antiapoptotic  xxxg251xxx  protein in colon cancer cells by a mechanism
that is not defined (36). in this same report, targeted deletion of the
proapoptotic gene bax rendered cells completely resistant to apoptosis
by  xxxd3259xxx  and indomethacin. in addition,  xxxd3260xxx  and  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone have been shown to down-regulate bcl-2 protein expression in sw480 cells (29). because  xxxg1369xxx /2 can regulate bcl-2
(37) and  xxxg251xxx  (38) protein expression in other cell types, it is
possible that nsaids down-regulate expression of these proteins by
their ability to inhibit  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling.  xxxd3259xxx  alters the expression and activation of several pro- and antiapoptotic bcl-2 family
members, perhaps shifting the balance in favor of the proapoptotic
members. regulation of the bcl-2 family of proteins may be the
ultimate mechanism by which  xxxd3259xxx  and other nsaids induce
apoptosis in cancer cells.
in summary, we have described the ability of egf to stimulate
phosphorylation of  xxxg1361xxx /2,  xxxg1369xxx /2, and bad(ser112) in human
colon cancer cells. phosphorylation of bad(ser112) induced by egf
is dependent on  xxxg1361xxx /2 activity in these cells.  xxxd3260xxx , in
addition to inhibiting basal expression of  xxxg1361xxx /2,  xxxg1369xxx /2, and
bad(ser112) phosphorylation, completely blocks the ability of egf to
induce activation of this pathway. this likely occurs by the ability of
 xxxd3259xxx  to inhibit  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling. treatment with  xxxd3259xxx , but not
 xxxd3462xxx , down-regulates total bad protein expression, an effect that
may mitigate the apoptotic effects of  xxxd3259xxx . the biochemical mech4

 xxxd3259xxx  inhibits egf phosphorylation of erk and bad

anism by which  xxxd3260xxx  inhibits egfr and  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling
is unknown, but may be mediated by its ability to bind to ras protein
in vitro (39), and thereby block downstream signaling. together these
results strengthen the role of  xxxg1369xxx /2 as a biochemical mechanism by
which  xxxd3259xxx , and perhaps additional nsaids, induce apoptotic cell
death in vitro and inhibit cancer cell growth in vivo.
