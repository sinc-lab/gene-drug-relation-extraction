context: hyponatremia [serum sodium concentration ([na⫹]), ⬍135
meq/liter] is the most common fluid and electrolyte abnormality
among hospitalized patients. it is frequently caused by the inappropriate release of  xxxd3495xxx .
objective: the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and
safety of oral  xxxd1747xxx , a vasopressin v1a/ xxxg231xxx  antagonist,
in patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia.
design: the study design was a 5-d placebo-controlled, randomized,
double-blind study.
setting: the study was performed at a hospital.
intervention: oral  xxxd1747xxx  (40 or 80 mg/d) or placebo was given
in two divided doses.
patients: seventy-four patients (average baseline serum [na⫹], 115
to ⬍130 meq/liter) were studied.
main outcome measure: the main outcome measure was the
change from baseline in serum [na⫹] area under the curve.

h

yponatremia, defined by a serum sodium concentration ([na⫹]) less than 135 meq/liter, is a potentially serious electrolyte abnormality observed in hospitalized patients (1–3). in conditions of volume depletion or
hypertonicity, secretion of  xxxd3495xxx  (avp), also
known as  xxxd3495xxx , is stimulated, water is reabsorbed in the kidneys, and concentrated urine is excreted.
in conditions of hypotonicity, avp is normally suppressed,
and dilute urine is excreted (4, 5).
hyponatremia is frequently caused by inappropriately elevated plasma avp levels, such as in the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of  xxxd3495xxx  (siadh),

results: the least-squares mean change from baseline in the serum
[na⫹] area under the curve with  xxxd1747xxx  (40 and 80 mg/d) was
2.0-fold (p ⫽ 0.03) and 2.5-fold (p ⬍ 0.001) greater, respectively, than
that with placebo. the median time to achieve a confirmed increase
in serum [na⫹] of 4 meq/liter or more from baseline was 71.7 h for
placebo, 27.5 h for 40 mg/d  xxxd1747xxx  (p ⫽ 0.044), and 12.1 h for 80
mg/d  xxxd1747xxx  (p ⫽ 0.002). the mean total times during which
patients had a serum [na⫹] level of 4 meq/liter or more above baseline
were 46.5, 69.8, and 88.8 h (p ⫽ 0.001), respectively. the least-squares
mean change in serum [na⫹] from baseline to end of treatment was
3.4 meq/liter for placebo, 6.4 meq/liter for 40 mg/d  xxxd1747xxx , and
8.2 meq/liter for 80 mg/d  xxxd1747xxx  (p ⫽ 0.002). a confirmed normal
serum [na⫹] (ⱖ135 meq/liter) or increase of 6 meq/liter or more was
observed in 48% of patients given placebo, 71% given 40 mg/d
 xxxd1747xxx , and 82% given 80 mg/d  xxxd1747xxx  (p ⫽ 0.014). headache,
hypotension, nausea, constipation, and postural hypotension were the
most common adverse events.
conclusion: oral  xxxd1747xxx  (40 and 80 mg/d) was well tolerated and
efficacious in correcting serum [na⫹] in hyponatremia. (j clin endocrinol metab 91: 2145–2152, 2006)

which is characterized by continued secretion of avp under
the condition of hypotonicity (5, 6). the causes of siadh
include neoplasms and a variety of central nervous system
and pulmonary disorders.
hypotonic hyponatremia also occurs relatively frequently
in patients with heart failure (hf) and other edema-forming
disorders (7, 8). despite a hypervolemic edematous state,
pronounced retention of sodium and water occurs in an
attempt to maintain effective arterial blood volume (4, 7, 9).
patients who have hyponatremia with advanced hf often
have inappropriately elevated plasma avp levels (7, 8) and
significantly poorer long-term prognosis than those with
normal serum [na⫹] (10).
asymptomatic chronic hyponatremia, which develops
over a period of more than 48 h, is usually treated with fluid
restriction (⬍800 ml/d) and less frequently with pharmacological agents, such as demeclocyclin, and urea (1, 11). in
contrast, acute or chronic symptomatic hyponatremia, which
includes symptoms ranging from lethargy and headache to
seizures or coma, necessitates hospitalization and immediate
treatment with hypertonic saline, loop diuretics, or both (11).

regardless of the treatment, care must be taken to avoid an
excessively rapid increase in serum [na⫹] and resultant osmotically induced pontine demyelination, especially in patients with chronic hyponatremia (3). increasing serum
[na⫹] by no more than 12 meq/liter䡠d is recommended to
avoid adverse effects associated with an overly rapid correction of sodium levels (3, 11). none of the currently available therapies directly addresses the effects of elevated
plasma avp, the underlying cause of many cases of
hyponatremia.
the binding of avp to v2 receptors leads to increased
permeability of the renal collecting duct surface cells and
reabsorption of water, which, if excessive, can lead to decreased plasma sodium levels (4, 7). the binding of avp to
v1a receptors on vascular smooth muscle causes vasoconstriction, although the avp levels required to generate a
pressor response are much higher than those necessary to
produce antidiuresis (7, 12). because avp receptors play a
key role in regulating osmolality and body fluid volume, v2
receptor blockade may be a beneficial treatment approach in
patients with hyponatremia.
several nonpeptide vasopressin receptor antagonists
have been developed in recent years (7), and  xxxd1747xxx 
is the first to be active at both v1a and v2 receptors (13).
in a study of healthy volunteers, the oral bioavailability of
 xxxd1747xxx  was 44%, and the drug’s aquaretic effects
(markedly increased urine flow rate and decreased urine
osmolality) persisted for at least 6 h (14). in patients with
advanced hf (new york heart association class iii or iv),
a single iv dose of  xxxd1747xxx  increased urine output and
reduced pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (15). the
study reported here assessed the efficacy and tolerability
of two oral doses of  xxxd1747xxx  (40 and 80 mg/d given in
two divided doses for 5 d) in patients with euvolemic or
hypervolemic hyponatremia.
patients and methods
this study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of
helsinki and its amendments and in compliance with all applicable local
and national laws and regulations. the study protocol and informed
consent document were approved by an institutional review board or
ethics committee at each site before patient enrollment. all patients were
required to sign the informed consent form.

patients
this double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study included
hospitalized patients from 21 sites in the united states, canada, and
israel who had euvolemic (absence of pitting edema) or hypervolemic
(edematous) hyponatremia. included in the study were men and women
(nonlactating and nonpregnant or practicing a barrier method of birth
control) at least 18 yr of age who had a serum [na⫹] of 115 to less than
130 meq/liter, a fasting blood glucose level less than 275 mg/dl (15
mmol/liter), plasma osmolality less than 290 mosmol/kg h2o, and no
evidence of extracellular volume depletion.
excluded were patients who had uncontrolled hypertension; significant orthostatic hypotension or supine systolic blood pressure less than
85 mm hg; uncontrolled arrhythmias; untreated severe hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or adrenal insufficiency; an estimated creatinine
clearance less than 20 ml/min; urinary outflow obstruction unless catheterized; an  xxxg941xxx  or aspartate aminotransferase
level more than five times the upper limit of normal;  xxxg124xxx  of
1.5 g/dl or less; prothrombin time greater than 22 sec or an international
normalized ratio greater than 2.0 without anticoagulant therapy or 3.0

or more with therapy; a white blood cell count less than 3000/␮l; hiv
infection; or active hepatitis. also ineligible were patients expected to
have hyponatremia necessitating emergent treatment during the study,
those with any concurrent illness that could interfere with study treatment or its evaluation, and patients who had participated in a clinical
trial of an investigational drug or device within 30 d of screening.

study procedures
the baseline period lasted from 20 –28 h, during which patients underwent single-blind administration of placebo twice daily. serum
[na⫹] was measured at 4, 6, and 12 h and at the end of the baseline period
(20 –28 h). patients whose serum [na⫹] was 133 meq/liter or greater by
the end of the baseline phase were not randomly assigned to treatment.
eligible patients were stratified by volume status and assigned randomly in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive placebo, 40 mg/d  xxxd1747xxx , or 80
mg/d  xxxd1747xxx  in two divided doses. before receiving medication on
d 1 and after the conclusion of treatment on d 5, patients underwent
electrocardiographic and clinical laboratory testing and evaluation of the
following parameters: safety profile (including vital signs, weight, and
volume status); serum [na⫹], serum potassium concentration ([k⫹]),
levels of avp and other neurohormones, and osmolality; and urinary
sodium, potassium, and creatinine levels, osmolality, and output. initial
assessments were performed daily before the first dose of study medication. serum sodium and potassium concentrations and plasma osmolality were determined at 4, 6, 12, and 24 h on each treatment day.
patients returned 6 –9 d after the conclusion of treatment for assessment
of serum [na⫹], weight, volume status, and vital signs.

diet and concomitant therapy
fluid intake was limited to 500 ml in a 3-h period up to a maximum
of 2.0 liters in 24 h. calorie consumption, caffeine ingestion, and 24-h
sodium intake remained stable throughout the study. consumption of
alcoholic beverages or grapefruit juice was not allowed.
because  xxxd1747xxx  is a substrate and potent inhibitor of the microsomal enzyme cytochrome p450 (cyp) 3a4, the concomitant use of
several agents was prohibited, including chemotherapeutic agents, calcium channel blockers, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl- xxxd1739xxx  reductase inhibitors, benzodiazepines, and immunosuppressants. other
prohibited medications included any medication known to cause
siadh (e.g. vasopressin, oxytocin, desmopressin, and carbamazepine)
and any medication used in the treatment of siadh. patients were
permitted to use amiodarone (at doses not exceeding 300 mg/d),
digoxin, and warfarin, provided the dosages were stable both before
screening and during the study.

efficacy end points and statistical analysis
primary efficacy end point. the primary efficacy end point was the change
from baseline in serum [na⫹], as measured by area under the serum
[na⫹]–time curve (auc). the serum [na⫹] auc was calculated using
the trapezoidal rule, and baseline serum [na⫹] was calculated as the
average of all measurements obtained during the baseline period. the
effect of treatment on baseline-adjusted auc was determined according
to an analysis of covariance model, in which treatment, treatment center,
and each patient’s volume status were the factors and baseline serum
[na⫹] was the covariate. the threshold of statistical significance of the
interactions between treatment and baseline serum [na⫹], treatment
center, and volume status was 0.1. the statistical comparisons between
 xxxd1747xxx  and placebo were performed with dunnett’s two-sided multiple test (threshold of significance, 0.05) (16, 17).
a sample size of 84 patients was estimated to provide 90% power to
detect a change in serum [na⫹] auc of 130 meq䡠h/liter, assuming a
dropout rate of 20%. the analysis was performed using the full analysis
set, which included all randomized patients who had at least one serum
[na⫹] measurement assessed at baseline, took at least one dose of study
medication, and had at least one valid follow-up measurement.
secondary efficacy end points. secondary efficacy parameters included the
time from the first dose to a confirmed increase in serum [na⫹] of
4 meq/liter or greater above baseline, the total time from first dose to
end of treatment during which serum [na⫹] was 4 meq/liter or greater

treatment, and the number of patients who achieved a confirmed normal
(ⱖ135 meq/liter) serum [na⫹] or increase of 6 meq/liter or more from
baseline. other efficacy parameters included the change from baseline
in free water clearance (fwc), effective water clearance (ewc), urine
and plasma osmolality, urinary sodium levels, serum avp, and other
neurohormone levels. the log-rank test, in which patients were stratified
by baseline volume status, was used for analysis of the first secondary
end point, the second and third parameters were analyzed in the same
manner as the primary end point, and the fourth parameter was analyzed using the cochran-mantel-haenszel procedure, stratified by vol-

ume status. all other efficacy parameters were summarized using descriptive statistics.

safety assessments
all patients who received any study medication were included in the
safety analysis. the incidence of adverse events (aes), changes in vital
signs, clinical laboratory parameters, and body weight were summarized. the rate and extent of the serum [na⫹] correction were also
assessed as a safety parameter. rapid serum [na⫹] correction was prospectively defined with the following four criteria: 1) serum [na⫹] in-

baseline characteristics

a total of 74 patients received  xxxd1747xxx  (40 or 80 mg/d)
or placebo (fig. 1). the baseline characteristics were similar
in the three groups (table 1). most patients (68%) were 65 yr
of age or older. hf, the most common underlying condition,
was present in 43% of all patients. the proportions of patients
with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia were similar in each of the three groups; approximately 75% of patients in the study had euvolemic hyponatremia at baseline.
only three patients, one from each treatment group, withdrew from the study.
efficacy

 xxxd1747xxx  was associated with prompt increases in serum [na⫹] that were sustained throughout the trial (fig. 2).
at 24 h on d 5, the least-squares (ls) mean ⫾ se increase from
baseline in serum [na⫹] was 4.7 ⫾ 1.15 meq/liter in the
placebo group, 6.5 ⫾ 1.08 meq/liter in patients given
 xxxd1747xxx  40 mg/d, and 8.7 ⫾ 1.06 meq/liter in patients
given  xxxd1747xxx  80 mg/d. the mean change from baseline

consumed total daily fluid volumes between 2 and 3 liters.
two patients in the 40 mg/d  xxxd1747xxx  group had gross
violations of fluid intake: one patient ingested nearly 12.5
liters of fluid on treatment d 4 and 5, and the other ingested
up to 5 liters of fluid each study day. despite the large
volumes of fluid intake, both patients experienced an increase in serum [na⫹] of 4 meq/liter or greater during the
treatment period. clinically significant increases in plasma
osmolality and decreases in urine osmolality and urinary
[na⫹] were seen in the  xxxd1747xxx  treatment groups (table
2). mean changes in plasma renin activity and norepinephrine, epinephrine, and aldosterone concentrations were similar across the three treatment groups. the number of patients with avp measurements was insufficient to assess the
relationship between  xxxd1747xxx  treatment and avp levels.
safety and tolerability

there were four deaths among the study population (table 3); none was considered to be related to study medication,
and all were attributed to progression of underlying illness.
two deaths occurred among placebo recipients, both of
whom had terminal cancer. the other two patients who died
were given 40 mg/d  xxxd1747xxx . one of these, who had a
history of cardiovascular disease, including chronic hf
(chf), died of hf and worsening renal disease 17 d after
receiving the last dose of study drug. the second patient,

who had a history of severe cardiomyopathy and chf, died
of cardiac failure 5 d after withdrawing from the study on d
5. she experienced a series of aes, including hypovolemia,
and was the only patient given  xxxd1747xxx  whose treatment
was prematurely discontinued due to aes.
serious aes occurred in three (13%) patients in the placebo
group, six (25%) patients given 40 mg/d  xxxd1747xxx , and one
(4%) patient given 80 mg/d  xxxd1747xxx . only two patients
had serious aes considered by investigators to be drug related. in one patient with severe cardiomyopathy and chf
who received 40 mg/d  xxxd1747xxx  along with diuretic therapy, hypovolemia developed on study d 2. the study drug
was withheld on d 3, and the patient recovered after treatment with normal saline. in the second patient, who had
schizophrenia and received 40 mg/d  xxxd1747xxx  for polydipsia-induced hyponatremia, hypotension developed on
study d 1. the second dose of  xxxd1747xxx  was withheld on
d 1. this patient recovered after receiving additional fluids
and a reduced dosage of study medication for all remaining
treatment days.
the incidence and types of aes associated with 40 and 80
mg/d  xxxd1747xxx  were similar to those observed with placebo (table 3). most of these events were considered by
investigators to be unlikely or definitely not related to study
medication. most drug-related aes were classified as mild.
the five most frequently reported aes were headache, hypotension, nausea, constipation, and postural hypotension.
the incidence of hypotension and postural hypotension was

ered probably related to study treatment. this patient recovered with administration of additional fluids and a reduced dosage of study medication.
five  xxxd1747xxx  recipients, three patients given 40 mg/d
and two patients treated with 80 mg/d, had a rapid serum
[na⫹] correction as defined in the protocol (see patients and
methods). none of these patients had aes associated with an
overly rapid correction of serum [na⫹], a serum [na⫹] increase of more than 24 meq/liter total from baseline, or a
serum [na⫹] level that exceeded 145 meq/liter. no patients
given placebo had a rapid rise in serum [na⫹].
in one patient given 40 mg/d  xxxd1747xxx , serum [na⫹]
increased from 128 meq/liter to 142 meq/liter between 0
and 4 h on d 2; no dosage modifications were made, and the
patient’s serum [na⫹] was 124 meq/liter at the end of treatment. in a second patient given 40 mg/d  xxxd1747xxx , serum
[na⫹] increased from 129 meq/liter at 6 h on d 2 to 142
meq/liter at 24 h on d 2. the second dose of study drug was
withheld on d 1, and a reduced dose was administered for
the remainder of the treatment period. this patient’s serum
[na⫹] was 141 meq/liter at the end of treatment. a third
patient in the 40 mg/d  xxxd1747xxx  group had a baseline
serum [na⫹] of 121 meq/liter that rose to 139 meq/liter at
12 h on d 4. treatment was withheld starting with the second
dose on d 4. the serum [na⫹] in this patient was 137 meq/

 xxxd1747xxx , serum [na⫹] increased from 121 meq/liter at
12 h on d 1 to 134 meq/liter at 12 h on d 2. this patient
withdrew from the study for administrative reasons on d 3.
no aes were reported. in a second patient given 80 mg/d,

ghali et al. •  xxxd1747xxx  for euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia

day beginning on d 3. by the end of treatment, serum [na⫹]
had dropped to 133 meq/liter.
treatment with  xxxd1747xxx  at doses up to 80 mg/d for 5 d
had no clinically significant ae on clinical chemistry, hematological measures, or coagulation. elevations in blood urea
nitrogen were no more frequent among those given
 xxxd1747xxx  than among those given placebo. three patients
in each  xxxd1747xxx  group and one patient in the placebo
group had increased serum creatinine values of clinical concern (defined as serum creatinine ⬎1.6 mg/dl); however, the
numbers of patients were too small to conclude that this was
a treatment effect. at 24 h on study d 5, the mean changes
from baseline in body weight were ⫺1.5 kg in the placebo
group, ⫺1.3 kg in the 40 mg/d group  xxxd1747xxx , and ⫺0.9
kg in the 80 mg/d  xxxd1747xxx  group. compared with placebo,  xxxd1747xxx  produced small mean decreases from baseline in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures (table 3);
however, these decreases were not clinically significant.
there were no clinically significant changes in mean heart
rate across the three treatment groups. the electrocardiographic findings both at baseline and on d 5 did not differ
significantly between treatment groups.
discussion

hyponatremia is the most frequent fluid and electrolyte
abnormality in hospitalized patients, particularly among
those in an intensive care setting (18, 19). when hyponatremia is severe or develops rapidly, it may become life-threatening. the disorder is associated with high mortality among
patients with a broad variety of serious underlying conditions (20, 21).
treatment with an avp receptor antagonist may provide
specific correction for dilutional hyponatremia in patients
with siadh or chf (3, 22). such therapy promotes the
elimination of free water while sparing electrolytes (23). in
contrast, therapy with currently available diuretics does not
directly address the effects of excess avp, promotes excretion of electrolytes, and may worsen hyponatremia, particularly in the elderly (24).
in this 5-d study, oral  xxxd1747xxx  was significantly more
effective than placebo at increasing serum [na⫹] in patients
with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia. all primary
and secondary efficacy measures as well as other parameters,
such as ewc and serum osmolality, demonstrated a clear
dose-response relationship with  xxxd1747xxx . prompt increases in serum [na⫹] were observed among patients in
both  xxxd1747xxx  groups, and there was no evidence linking
any ae to an overly rapid correction of serum [na⫹].
 xxxd1747xxx  was generally well tolerated; aes were as
likely to occur among patients given placebo as among those
receiving  xxxd1747xxx . headache and constipation appeared
to occur more often in patients given  xxxd1747xxx  than in
those given placebo. the incidence of hypotension and postural hypotension was no more frequent among those given
 xxxd1747xxx  than those given placebo. thus, it is unlikely that
the hypotension events that occurred in patients given
 xxxd1747xxx  were a result of v1a antagonism, and it appears
that the v1a antagonism had little or no clinical effect. only
one patient, given 40 mg/d  xxxd1747xxx , withdrew from the

study due to a series of aes, which included hypovolemia
that was classified as possibly related to the study drug. this
patient had a history of severe cardiomyopathy and chf and
later died from cardiac failure, an event investigators determined was unlikely to be related to the study medication.
the hypovolemia may have been due to the volume contraction associated with  xxxd1747xxx ’s pharmacodynamic effect. there were no meaningful changes in volume status,
vital signs, or body weight over the course of treatment.
the relatively small number of patients in each treatment
group may be considered a study limitation. nevertheless,
the sample sizes provided sufficient statistical power to detect differences between the  xxxd1747xxx  groups and placebo
in serum [na⫹] auc and other efficacy measures. comparisons across treatment groups for subpopulations of patients
were limited by the small sample sizes, however.
in vitro studies confirm that  xxxd1747xxx  is both a substrate
and potent inhibitor of cyp3a4, a major isoenzyme in the
human liver and small intestine responsible for drug metabolism. in vivo pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction
studies demonstrated that oral  xxxd1747xxx  caused significant
decreases in the metabolism of other drugs processed
through cyp3a4, leading to clinically significant increases in
systemic exposure of these drugs. because of these findings,
only the iv formulation is being developed.
the results of this study and another efficacy trial with iv
 xxxd1747xxx  (25) demonstrate that  xxxd1747xxx  provides a targeted approach for correcting hyponatremia in euvolemic
and hypervolemic patients.  xxxd1747xxx  is a novel aquaretic
agent that blocks avp receptors in the kidney to increase
electrolyte-free water excretion. this approach directly addresses the effects of excessive or inappropriate avp secretion and allows serum [na⫹] to increase at a rapid, but safe,
rate.
