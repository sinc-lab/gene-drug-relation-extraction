the excretory–secretory (e–s) products of the parasitic nematodes trichostrongylus colubriformis and nematodirus battus
were found to modify the in vitro proliferation of the tumorous colic ht29-d4 cell line of epithelial origin. a
characteristic feature of these e–s products is the presence of a high level of acetylcholinesterase (ache) activity, the
biological significance of which remains unclear. to determine a possible role of ache on cell growth, the enzyme was
purified from e–s products using  xxxd1968xxx  chloride. purity was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,
using silver and karnovsky stains, before assessing its effects on cell proliferation. the purified ache was incorporated
at different concentrations in a culture medium of ht29-d4 cells. a mitogenic effect was shown for low concentrations
(0n1–14 units). by contrast, an inhibitory effect was noted at high concentrations (35–1400 units). furthermore, polyclonal
antibodies were prepared and depletion of ache in e–s products by immunoprecipitation or affinity chromatography
resulted in a partial or total disappearance of the stimulatory effect of cell growth. thus, the results from this in vitro study
suggest a modulatory role for ache secreted by nematode parasites on the proliferation of epithelial cells of the host.

the importance of excretory–secretory (e–s)
products from gastrointestinal parasites for their
establishment and maintenance within their host has
been recognized for several decades. these released
molecules have been shown to be involved in the
pathogenic processes by interfering with the host
physiology or immunology (yeates & ogilvie, 1976 ;
castro, 1981 ; lightowlers & rickard, 1988 ; abe,
nawa & yoshimura, 1992). in the case of the trichostrongylid parasites of the gastrointestinal tract of
domestic ruminants, the effects of the e–s products
from species occurring in the stomach or the small
intestine have been investigated on host cell and
tissue physiology. the secretions of ostertagia
ostertagi, a parasite of the abomasum, were found
to induce the release of pepsinogen from isolated
gastric glands (mckellar, mostofa & eckersal, 1990),
and possibly to be involved in the inhibition of
secretion of hydrochloric acid from gastric mucosa
(eiler et al. 1981). on the other hand, secretions of
trichostrongylus colubriformis and nematodirus battus
have been shown to alter the intestinal peristaltism
(savin et al. 1990 ; foster & lee, 1996). recently,
the e–s products from several trichostrongylid

species were found to modify the cell growth of a
tumorous colic cell line ht29-d4 of epithelial
origin (hoste et al. 1995 ; huby et al. 1995). these
in vitro results can be related to an hyperplasia of the
crypts of lieberku$ hn which are commonly observed
in ruminants or in rabbits when infected in vivo with
different intestinal species (barker, 1975 ; armour et
al. 1988 ; hoste, kerboeuf & parodi, 1988). nevertheless, the precise biochemical nature of the
molecule responsible for this mitogenic effect has not
been identified.
among the substances excreted or secreted into
the immediate environment of the parasites, the
enzyme acetylcholinesterase (ache) has been found
to be released by a large number of nematode species
(ogilvie et al. 1973 ; rothwell, ogilvie & love, 1973 ;
yeates & ogilvie, 1976 ; mallet, 1989 ; mallet, huby
& hoste, 1997). most of the studies have investigated
the biochemical characterization of this enzyme
(hogarth-scott et al. 1973 ; yeates & ogilvie, 1976 ;
pritchard et al. 1991 ; blackburn & selkirk, 1992 ;
brown & pritchard, 1993 ; griffiths & pritchard,
1994 ; mallet et al. 1997). the volume of enzyme
secreted by the different parasitic nematodes has
been largely explored (ogilvie et al. 1973 ; rothwell
et al. 1973 ; mallet, 1989 ; knox & jones, 1990 ;
lawrence & pritchard, 1993). it has been assessed in
several parasite species and high levels have been
shown occurring in some species, in particular t.

colubriformis and n. battus (mallet et al. 1997). this
large volume of enzyme in the different species could
imply that secretory ache may play an important
role in the survival of nematode species within their
host. however, the biological significance of the
ache secretion by parasitic nematodes remains a
matter of debate. several roles have previously been
proposed (pritchard, 1993 ; lee, 1996). for instance,
blackburn & selkirk (1992) attributed an anticoagulant effect by inactivation of the plateletactivating factor to ache. it has been suggested also
that the enzyme could moderate the immune response by breaking down acetylcholine (pritchard,
1993 ; rhoads, 1984). its effect on cells may be
involved in the glycogenesis by providing energy
to the worms (yeates & ogilvie, 1976). pritchard
(1993) believed that ache may provide acetate and
choline precursors for nematode metabolism, while
lee (1970) proposed that the enzyme may alter the
permeability of the cells of the host. however, these
different roles remain hypothetical as no convincing
evidence is available to support any of them. in
contrast, the possibility of an effect of the worm
ache on the host cell growth has not been explored
despite the fact that some medical observations have
shown that high levels of ache activities were
associated with some tumoral processes (razon et al.
1984 ; zakut et al. 1990 ; lapidot-lifson et al. 1989 ;
soreq & zakut, 1990).
the aim of this work was to investigate the
possible role of the ache from the e–s products of
t. colubriformis and n. battus on the proliferation of
ht29-d4 cells. this was ascertained by examining
the effect of purified ache from the two species on
the cell line. using t. colubriformis as a model, the
enzyme was also depleted from the e–s products to
confirm that the proliferative effect is dependent on
the presence of the enzyme.

collection of parasites and e–s products
seven-week-old new zealand rabbits were infected
with 10 000 trichostrongylus colubriformis infective
3rd-stage larvae (l3) by means of a gastric cannula.
in addition, 3-month-old, worm-free sheep were
orally inoculated with 10 000 l3 of nematodirus
battus. adult worms were collected from rabbits
killed on day 14 and sheep on day 21 post-infection.
the proximal third of the small intestine was
immediately opened longitudinally and washed
gently in 0n9 % nacl to remove any food particles.
the intestine was then placed on a baermann
apparatus with saline buffer at 37 mc. the worms
were allowed to detach from the mucosa and were
collected by sedimentation. then the worms were
washed carefully 3 times in dulbecco’s modified
eagle’s medium (dmem) in order to prevent any

490

contamination with host material. the possibility of
contamination with host extracts has been explored
previously using the last washing of worms and the
results did not indicate any proliferative effects due
to tissue contaminants (hoste et al. 1995 ; huby,
1997, unpublished ph.d. thesis, university of
tours). moreover, the dmem containing hepes
(25 m) was supplemented with penicillin
(1000 i.u.\ml) and streptomycin (1 mg\ml) to avoid
bacterial proliferation. the nematode concentration
was then adjusted to 200 worms\ml for t.
colubriformis and 100 worms\ml for n. battus to
optimize the conditions for secretion (bone &
bottjer, 1986). the worms were then maintained for
24 h in 25 cm# tissue-culture flasks in dmem at
37 mc in a humidified atmosphere of air and co
#
(95 %\5 %). the media conditioned by the worms
(i.e. containing the e–s products) were filtered
through low-protein binding 0n22 µ filters
(minisart n, sartorius sa, france) to complete the
sterilization. they were then immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at k70 mc until used for
the purification of parasite ache and to assess its
effects on the ht29-d4 cell line. as a control,
dmem alone was incubated under the same
conditions as the worm conditioned medium (hoste
et al. 1995 ; huby et al. 1995).
measurement of protein concentration and ache
activity
the protein concentration of the e–s products was
estimated according to the microassay procedure of
the bio-rad protein assay (bio-rad laboratories,
gmbh, mu$ nchen, germany). the assay was performed using a modified micro-method (mallet et al.
1997).
the ache activity was assayed by the colorimetric
technique of ellman et al. (1961), using a micromethod with 20 µl samples. ache activity was
expressed per unit, 1 unit representing 1 n acetylthiocholine iodide hydrolysed\ml\min. the presence of  xxxg248xxx  activity has been previously explored with results indicating that the
tested activity corresponds (88 %) to the true ache
activity (ec 3;1;1;7) (mallet et al. 1997).
purification of ache
ache from the e–s products of t. colubriformis and
n. battus were purified by affinity chromatography
using an  xxxd1968xxx –sepharose column, according to the procedure described by griffiths &
pritchard (1994). the e–s products were previously
concentrated by centriplustm concentrators
(10 kda) (amicon, millipore). six ml (300 µg
protein\ml) of the retenate (mr  10 kda) containing ache was applied to a column (15 cm long,
1n5 cm diameter) of epoxy-activated sepharose

effect of trichostrongylid ache on cell growth

(sigma sa), to which  xxxd1968xxx  chloride (a
specific ache inhibitor) had been previously
coupled (hodgson & chubb, 1983). the gel was first
washed thoroughly at 4 mc with 50 m phosphate
buffer, ph 8, with a flow rate adjusted to 0n3 ml\min.
the unbound proteins were then removed by a salt
wash using 0n5  nacl. the bound secretory
ache was then eluted using 12 m  xxxd1968xxx 
chloride in phosphate-nacl (flow rate : 0n2 ml\min).
fractions of 1n5 ml were collected. as  xxxd1968xxx 
chloride is an enzyme inhibitor and high nacl
concentrations interfere with the subsequent running of polyacrylamide (page) gels and with
the cell growth, these substances were removed
by centrifugation with microcon4-10 (amicon,
millipore) before further analysis. the dmem
control was applied to the column and treated under
the same conditions as the e–s products. the
recovered fraction was also used as a control for cell
growth. the ache activity was determined. several
dilutions of the purified fraction containing ache
were applied to the cells and their effects were
compared at the same dilutions as the control
fraction.
assessment of purity of ache
to verify the purity of ache obtained after affinity
chromatography on the  xxxd1968xxx –sepharose
columns, the purified fraction of ache (20 µg
protein) was analysed on 10 % polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (page) (non-denaturing) by comparing proteins and ache stainings. the gel was
run at 4 mc and 200 v using mini-protean ii
(bio-rad). proteins were stained with silver. confirmation of the presence of ache was achieved
using the method of karnovsky (karnovsky & roots,
1964).
cell culture
the ht29-d4 cell line, which is the usual model for
the study of epithelial cell growth and differentiation
(rousset, 1986), was derived from the parental
human colonic adenocarcinoma ht29 cell line of
epithelial origin (fantini et al. 1986). the ht29-d4
cells were routinely cultured at 37 mc in a humidified
atmosphere of air and co (93 %\7 %) in
#
dmem : ham f12 (1\1). this medium containing
2n5 m glutamine was supplemented with 10 % (v\v)
heat inactivated fetal calf serum (d.a.p, france), 50
i.u. penicillin\ml and 50 µg streptomycin\ml (standard medium). before assessing the effects of the
e–s products and the purified ache fraction, the
ht29-d4 cells were harvested and seeded at 2000
cells\well in 96-well microplates as described previously (huby et al. 1995). after culture for 72 h, the
ht29-d4 standard medium was replaced by serumfree dmem buffered with 25 m hepes supple-

491

mented with insulin (1n7 µg\ml), transferrin
(4 µg\ml) and selenium (10 ng\ml). for both parasite species (i.e. t. colubriformis and n. battus),
dilutions of media conditioned by the worms or
purified ache fraction were tested and compared
with the same dilutions of control medium. similarly, in order to compare the effects obtained with a
purified ache from another origin, purified eel
ache (sigma) was tested at 2, 20, 200 and 2000
units of enzymatic activity. the cells were then
maintained for 72 h with the media containing the
dilutions being changed every day. to measure the
ability of cells to proliferate,  xxxg681xxx 
(egf) (sigma chemical co, st louis, mo) was
used as positive control  xxxd1891xxx −( .
mtt assay
the cell growth was measured by means of the
mtt assay performed according to mosmann
(1983), with slight modifications. after cells were
incubated for 72 h, with or without the e–s products
or purified ache, 150 µl of mtt reagent consisting
of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide at 0n3 mg\ml and phenazine methosulfate at 0n1 mg\ml were added to each well. the
plates were then incubated for 1 h at 37 mc. the
resulting formazan was extracted by addition of
100 µl of acidified isopropanol to each well (1 ml of
hcl\100 ml isopropanol). the absorbance was
measured at 550 nm using a lp 500 multiscan
spectrophotometer (diagnostics pasteur).
[$h ] thymidine incorporation assays
after cells were incubated in 96-well microplates for
72 h with or without purified ache fraction,
tritiated thymidine ([$h]tdr thymidine methyl $h,
icn 24070) was added (1 µci of 37 kbq\ml) to the
medium. the cells were then maintained for 4 h
before they were collected with a cell harvester
(cambridge technology). the incorporation of
[$h]tdr in dna was determined by liquid scintillation counting (kontron instruments).
antisera to purified n. battus ache
a polyclonal antiserum was raised to ache purified
from the e–s products of n. battus, as the enzyme
from this species is more stable and was available in
greater quantities than that of t. colubriformis. a 12week-old new zealand rabbit was immunized subcutaneously with 3 injections of 10 µg of enzyme at
intervals of 10 days. the first injection included
freund’s complete adjuvant (sigma sa). for the
subsequent injections, ache was emulsified with
freund’s incomplete adjuvant. igg was recovered
from serum of the immunized rabbit (anti-ache
igg) and of a non-treated rabbit (control igg) by

f. huby, s. mallet and h. hoste

affinity chromatography using an avid al4 gel
(interchim, bioprobe international inc). igg
preparations raised to ache were tested against e–s
products of n. battus by western blotting. they
were also used to remove ache activity from the
e–s products of t. colubriformis by immunoprecipitation (see below).

western blotting
the e–s products of n. battus were electrophoretically separated on 10 % page gels under
non-denaturing conditions, using mini-protean ii
(bio-rad). approximately 20 µg of proteins were
loaded in a volume of 15 µl. after electrophoresis,
ache activity was assessed on one part of the gel
using the karnovsky staining method (karnovsky &
roots, 1964). the other part of the gel was
transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. transfer
by blotting was carried out for 60 min at 30 ma and
60 v. non-specific binding sites on the membrane
were blocked overnight with 10 % skimmed milk
(sm) in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs). subsequently, the blots were washed 3 times in pbs with
0n05 % tween 20 (pbs–t20) and then incubated for
90 min with anti-ache igg and control igg,
diluted 1 : 50 in pbs–t20 (0n05 %)–sm (5 %). three
washings were then followed by incubation for 1 h
with goat anti-rabbit igg, conjugated to peroxidase,
diluted 1 : 1000 in pbs–t20–sm. the blots were
washed 3 times in pbs–t20 and 2 times in pbs
before incubation in substrate (3,3 diaminobenzidine) (sigma) diluted in pbs with 0n05 % (v\v)

use of immunoprecipitation technique. the e–s
products of t. colubriformis and the control dmem
were incubated overnight at 4 mc and ph 8 in the
absence (control) or presence of anti-ache igg or
control igg diluted 1 : 200. ten mg of protein
a–sepharose (sigma) were then added to all samples
maintained at room temperature for 1 h with gentle
stirring. samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at
10 000 g. ache activity was determined before and
after immunoprecipitation. all supernatants were
diluted (at 0n1 and 0n5 µg protein\ml) in dmem and
tested on the cell growth. their effects were
compared with the same dilutions of e–s products.
use of  xxxd1968xxx -sepharose. the removal of
ache from the e–s products was carried out by
affinity chromatography using a column (3 ml) of
epoxy-activated sepharose coupled with  xxxd1968xxx  chloride equilibrated in dmem. the e–s
products (2 ml) of t. colubriformis were applied and

492

recovered after elution. the protein concentrations
and ache activity were determined before and after
the elution. the gel was washed with the different
buffers previously described and the bound secretory
ache was removed. in the same manner, after
equilibration in dmem, the medium non-conditioned by the worms (2 ml) was applied and the
eluted fraction was then recovered and used as
control. different concentrations (from 0n1 and
0n5 µg protein\ml) of these collected fractions were
incorporated into the cell culture medium. their
effect was compared to the effect of the untreated
e–s products at the same concentrations.

statistical analyses
the student’s t-test was used to compare the growth
of cells measured by either od (mtt method) or
c.p.m. (incorporation of [$h]thymidine) between the
control and the conditioned medium (or purified
ache fraction) at different concentrations, in the
different experiments (minimal replicates, n l 8).


purification of ache
the process of purification was similar for the two
species to that described by griffith & pritchard
(1994). the purity of the isolated ache was
demonstrated only with n. battus because of its
greater stability and amount compared to t.
colubriformis (fig. 1). the profiles, following gel
electrophoresis, showed the presence of multiple
bands of proteins in the e–s products (line e). after
purification, 6 bands of proteins (a, b, c, d, e, f)
were observed (line d). when the method of
karnovsky, which reveals the existence of ache,
was applied to the total e–s products (line c) and to
the purified ache (line b), the same number of
bands of ache activity appeared in the two cases.
these profiles were similar, and corresponded to the
same bands of proteins revealed by silver staining
(line d) of the purified fraction. the western blot
(line a) showed that the anti-ache igg preparations
recognized 4 bands (c, d, e, f), which corresponded
to ache activity.

effect of purified t. colubriformis ache on the
ht29-d4 cell line
stimulation of ht29-d4 cell growth was first
assessed using total t. colubriformis e–s products
obtained from 1 to 10 µg protein\ml, which correspond to ache activities of 0n7 to 7 units (fig.
2 a). a similar effect was found when the purified
ache was applied on the cells. the enzyme induced
by itself a significant increase in proliferation of the

control values. the maximal effects were detected at

these results were obtained with the mtt assay.
they were confirmed by measuring the tritiated

similar (0n7–14 units) to those tested with t.

ache activity. on the other hand, stimulation of the
proliferation of the ht29-d4 cell line was still
present at the concentration of 0n5 µg protein\ml,
which corresponded to ache activity of 0n4 units.

the present data support a new hypothesis for the
role of the ache secreted by trichostrongylid
nematodes on the host–parasite relationship. the
results showed an in vitro modification of the cell
proliferation associated with ache from parasitic
origin. previous experiments have shown that the
e–s products from t. colubriformis stimulated the
growth of the tumorous colic cell line ht29-d4
(hoste et al. 1995). in addition, another study has
described modulatory effects of e–s products
depending on the trichostrongylid species on the cell
growth of the same cell line (huby et al. 1995). the
results from these previous studies suggested that
some chemical components secreted by the trichostrongylid species stimulated the proliferation of the
cells. a role of the enzyme ache was suspected, due
to some circumstantial evidence, in that h. contortus,
a parasite of the stomach of sheep, did not secrete
ache. it was the only species where no effects on
cell growth could be measured with the e–s products
(huby et al. 1995). further indication of this has
been gained from the present study where a
relationship was found between the observed effects
on the cell line ht29-d4 and ache concentrations.
when the concentrations of e–s products of
nematodes incorporated in the cell culture medium
were expressed in ache units, the inhibitory effect
observed with n. battus e–s products corresponded
to high ache activities. by diluting the e–s
products of this species to ache concentrations
similar to those of t. colubriformis e–s products, the
same stimulatory effect was observed. therefore, all
these observations suggested that secreted ache
could affect differently the local mitotic activity of
cells depending on the concentrations.
thus, the experiments described herein constitute
a comprehensive analysis of the effects of ache
purified from the e–s products of t. colubriformis
and n. battus on the growth of ht29-d4
cells. purification of the enzyme was performed
using affinity chromatography on edrophoniumsepharose, which was described as a suitable and
reliable method for the purification of nematode
secretory ache (pritchard et al. 1991). griffiths &
pritchard (1994) demonstrated that the enzyme
isolated from e–s products of t. colubriformis by

f. huby, s. mallet and h. hoste

this technique was pure. the efficiency of this
method was confirmed in our study with n. battus
e–s products following gel electrophoresis of the
purified enzyme, which showed that all the protein
bands detected by silver stain exhibited ache
activity.
the results obtained with purified ache from
e–s products of the two nematodes, clearly demonstrate that the enzyme alone is able to affect the
cell growth, inducing either stimulation at low
concentrations or an inhibition at high concentrations. these effects are similar to those observed
with the total e–s products for the same nematode
species and occurred at similar ache concentrations. however, when ache from the electric eel
was used for comparison, significantly higher enzymatic concentrations were needed to induce similar effects to those observed with nematodes. this
suggests that nematode secretory ache is more
efficient at controlling in vitro the proliferation of the
ht29-d4 cells than ache from another exogeneous
origin.
other molecules that produce similar effects may
be present conjunctively with ache in the e–s
products of nematodes. to check the possible
presence of such substances, we aimed to remove the
enzyme activity from t. colubriformis e–s products
and then to assess the effect of these depleted
products on the cell line. firstly, an immunoprecipitation technique was used to remove ache
from the e–s products. antibodies against ache
were prepared with purified ache of n. battus,
because, in this species, the enzyme was more stable
and was available in greater quantity relative to t.
colubriformis. by using this technique, only 55 % of
ache activity was removed from the e–s products
of t. colubriformis. this was certainly due to the fact
that the immunoserum did not bind to all the
molecular forms of ache. this result is comparable
to the 36 % residual enzymatic activity obtained for
necator americanus e–s products by brown &
pritchard (1993) using the same method. because of
this residual activity, the depletion was only partial
at higher concentration (0n4 units of enzyme were
present at 0n5 µg protein\ml) in the treated e–s
products. as a consequence, the stimulatory effect
did not totally disappear. it is worth emphasizing
that this ache residual activity corresponded to the
range of concentrations previously described as
having an effect on cell growth. at low concentration
(0n1 µg protein\ml), the depletion in enzyme activity
was nearly total (0n08 units). this negligible enzymatic activity did not induce any effect whereas
the untreated e–s products or those treated with
control igg kept a mitogenic effect. lastly, to
complete the immunoprecipitation experiment,
affinity chromatography on  xxxd1968xxx -sepharose
was used to achieve a total depletion of the e–s
products. in this latter case, all ache activity was

496

removed and the absence of the enzyme could be
associated with the total disappearance of the
stimulative effect. this confirmed that, at least for t.
colubriformis, ache alone is responsible for the
effects observed with the e–s products.
in addition to the role of ache in synaptic
junctions, non-synaptic functions have also been
evoked for the enzyme (massoulie et al. 1993 ; small,
1990). in particular, some relationship between
ache and the proliferation of various cell types has
been suspected in different circumstances. firstly,
some clinical data have shown the presence of high
levels of ache activity (i) in different tumorous
processes (ovarian carcinomas, meningiomas and
gliomas) (razon et al. 1984 ; zakut et al. 1990) and
(ii) in serum from various leukaemic patients
(lapidot-lifson et al. 1989 ; soreq & zakut, 1990).
secondly, some in vitro experiments have demonstrated that ache has a role in the development of
neurones and the growth of neurite (small, 1990 ;
layer, weikert & alber, 1993), as well as in the
mitotic activity of pigmental epithelial cells of the
chicken retina (layer & sporns, 1987 ; vollmer &
layer, 1987). lastly, the effects of ache have been
investigated in vitro on the growth of fibroblastic and
erythroleukaemia cell lines (bartos & glinos, 1976 ;
paoletti, mocali & vannucchi, 1992). these studies
showed an implication of ache in the regulation of
the proliferation of different cell types suggesting
that the enzyme could act as an autocrine factor. the
results of these studies are in agreement with our
study, in particular with the inhibition observed
with the high ache concentrations. paoletti et al.
(1992) have also shown an arrest of cell growth with
increasing amounts of exogenous ache from bovine
origin.
in relation to the digestive epithelium, there is
limited and somewhat contradictory information
available about the effect of the neural parasympathetic system and ache on the division of
intestinal crypt cell. clarke (1976) found a decrease
in the mitotic rate in ileal crypts after a surgical
vagotomy. moreover, injections of acetylcholine or
the inhibition of ache have been shown to induce
stimulation of cell proliferation (tutton, 1975). a
role of cholinesterases in cell renewal has been
recently suggested by lhermite, sine & colas (1996),
but they detected  xxxg248xxx  and not
ache in the crypts and enterocytes.
however, a major difference exists between previous studies of ache and our study. except for
paoletti et al. (1992), all previously published data
based on ache were based on material of endogenous origin whereas, in the present report, the
ache which modified the cell growth was of an
exogenous origin. it is secreted by several species of
parasite which inhabit the digestive tract of the host
and which cause a detrimental effect on the health of
the host. thus, the results from the present experi-

effect of trichostrongylid ache on cell growth

ments identify for the first time a possible biological
function of a molecule from the e–s products of t.
colubriformis and n. battus, which is responsible for
a proliferative effect in vitro on cells. a role for
ache secreted by the worms in the cell growth is
thus described. an in vivo role of this secreted ache
in the intestinal crypt cell renewal during parasitism
is thus proposed, but requires further verification.
the function of this enzyme might be to regulate a
tissue mechanism for the repair of damage caused by
the worms at the site of infection, and thereby to
create an adaptive region beyond the infected part of
intestine, possibly for compensatory absorption
(hoste et al. 1988). the possibility that some nematode parasites secrete such a substance for the
modification of the proliferation of the host tissue of
the digestive tract locally is of major importance.
this will also lead to a better understanding of the
mechanisms which regulate the host–parasite relationship and influence the virulence of different
species or strains of parasite.
