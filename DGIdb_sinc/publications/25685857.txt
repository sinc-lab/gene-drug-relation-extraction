 xxxd2867xxx :  xxxg1688xxx  inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in cancer.   xxxg1688xxx  ( xxxg1688xxx ) and its ligands,  xxxg1688xxx  ligand 1 ( xxxg380xxx ) and 2 (pd-l2) play an important role in regulating immune response through various mechanisms. this inhibitory action is thought to assist in immune evasion by cancer cells as  xxxg1688xxx ,  xxxg380xxx  and pd-l2 have been found to be abnormally expressed by tumor cells and lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment. preclinical studies described  xxxg1688xxx  blockade resulting in tumor growth suppression and even decreased metastasis. this has led to the development of  xxxd2867xxx  (mk-3475), a highly selective, humanized monoclonal igg4-kappa isotype antibody against  xxxg1688xxx . early clinical trials have shown high tumor response rates and long duration of effect in previously treated advanced melanoma resulting in accelerated fda approval for the drug in this situation.  xxxd2867xxx  has also had success in non-small cell lung cancer and is being tested in multiple other tumor types. this review will discuss the development, preclinical data, pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy to date of  xxxd2867xxx .anti- xxxg1688xxx  antibody;  xxxd2867xxx ; mk-3475; melanoma; nsclc;  xxxd2867xxx
