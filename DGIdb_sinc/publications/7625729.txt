introduction
progesterone as well as the synthetic progestogens usually display a mixture of
distinct hormonal andlor antihormonal activities in vitro and in viva depending on
their structure, progestogens may also have estrogenic (norethynodrel), androgenic
( xxxd2751xxx , levonorgestrel) or antiandrogenic ( xxxd1786xxx , chlormadinone acetate) effects (for reference see ref. 3).
besides its progestogenic activity, progesterone gives rise to antimineralocorticoid4-'' and antiandrogenic effects in vivo. 13-15 most synthetic progestogens presently
used in oral contraception and hormone therapy differ from progesterone in that
they have no antiandrogenic or antimineralocorticoid activity. exceptions to this are
 xxxd1786xxx  and chlormadinone acetate with their antiandrogenic propertied6
and gestodene, which has a weak antimineralocorticoid effect.
 xxxd1946xxx '* is a novel type of progestogen: the compound represents the first
potent synthetic progestogen to exhibit both antiandrogenic and antimineralocorticoid
activity at pharmacologically relevant dose levels.  xxxd1946xxx 's antimineralocorticoid effects were earlier demonstrated in rats' and in humans.2 here, a complete
endocrine pharmacological profile of  xxxd1946xxx  is presented. the binding affinity to
steroid hormone receptors has been investigated. furthermore, the pharmacodynamic
profile was studied in vivo in appropriate animal models.  xxxd1946xxx  was found
to combine potent progestogenic with antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity at similar dose levels. the compound is devoid of any additional steroid agonistic
or antagonistic activity. the pharmacological properties of  xxxd1946xxx  were confirmed in vitru by transactivation experiments in cell lines transfected with individual
steroid receptors and a reporter gene. together, these data imply that the steroid
agonistic and antagonistic properties of  xxxd1946xxx  are based on direct interactions
with the respective steroid hormone receptors.

because of its antimineralocorticoid activity,  xxxd1946xxx  is expected to minimize
certain estrogen-induced side effects in women and to give rise to a number of
additional health benefits on clinical application.

0.1 mg/animal levonorgestrel, or 3, 10, or 30 mg/animal spironolactone as reference.
the animals were sacrificed on the day following completion of treatment. uterine
horns were dissected and examined histologically after hematoxylin-eosin staining.
progestational (secretory) transformation of the endometrium was assessed in
histological preparations according to a modified mcphail-scale (rating grades 1-4;
1 = no action; 4 = complete transformation; see ref. 19). the dose that results in a
mcphail-value of 1.5 as group average was considered to represent the threshold
value.
inhibition of ovulation in the cyclic rat

rats with regular 4-day cycles were treated for 4 consecutive days with 0.3, 1,
3, or 10 mg/animal/day  xxxd1946xxx  (6 animals per dose), beginning in metestrus.
unilateral ovariectomy and tubectomy were carried out under ether narcosis on the
fourth day. crush preparations were prepared from the tubes and examined by light

microscopy for the presence of oocytes. on the fifth day, the animals were sacrificed,
the remaining tube was removed and investigated as described above. the percentage
of animals in which ovulation was inhibited on the fourth andor fifth day was
determined in the individual dosage groups.
maintenance of pregnancy in ovariectomized rats

female rats (moellegard breeding center ltd., denmark) weighing 200-230 g
were mated. the presence of sperm in vaginal smears was considered day 1 of
pregnancy. the animals were ovariectomized on day 8 p.c. and treated with estrone
(1 pdanimal s.c.) and either  xxxd1946xxx  or  xxxd1786xxx  (s.c. or p.0.). the
progestogens were given s.c. in doses of 0.1, 1, 3, or 10 mg/animal/day; 10 animals
per dose). the oral doses were 1 x 3 mg every 24 hrs, 2 x 1.5 mg every 12 hrs, 3
x 1 mg every 8 hrs or 6 x 0.5 mg every 4 hrs in 0.5 ml vehicle. treatment was
started on day 8 p.c. 2 hrs before ovariectomy and continued for 4 consecutive days
(days 8-11 p.c.). animals were sacrificed one day after the last treatment (day 12
p.c.). the degree of maintenance was calculated by dividing the number of live
fetuses by the total number of implantation sites in the left uterine horn (given in
%). fetuses with beating hearts were regarded as alive. the absence of implantation
sites (castrated controls) was defined as 0% pregnancy maintenance.
antigonadotropic effect in male cynomolgus monkeys

male cynomolgus monkeys (macacafascicularis) were treated with 4 mg drospirenonekglday p.0. or 40 mg spironolactone/kg/day p.0. on days 5, 7, 10, 12 and 14
(5 animalslgroup) of the experiment. blood samples were drawn before (days 1
and 3) and 24 hrs after each treatment. serum testosterone was determined by
radioimmunoassay (s. hasan, unpublished).

anabolic/androgen test in the castrated rat
juvenile male rats (han:wist) weighing about 100 g were castrated. beginning
seven days after castration, they received s.c. injections of 10 mg drospirenonel
animavday or 0.1 mg  xxxd3327xxx /animal/day on 12 days within two
weeks (n = 6 animals/group). animals were sacrificed on the day after the last
treatment and the fresh weights of seminal vesicles, prostate and m. levator ani were
determined. for evaluation, organ weights were normalized to 100 g body weight.
the mean value and standard deviation were calculated for each group. the differences
between the groups were tested for statistical significance by multiple variance
analysis.

none or  xxxd1786xxx  as a reference compound at doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, or
10 mg/animal/day together with 0.1 mg  xxxd3327xxx  (tp)/animal/day for
7 days. controls received only the vehicle or tp. one day after the last treatment,
the animals were sacrificed. the weights of the seminal vesicles and prostate were
determined. in addition, the weight of the adrenal glands and the body weight were
recorded. all organ weights were normalized to mg/100 g body weight. data were
evaluated by plotting the percentage inhibition of organ weight against the corresponding dose whereby the tp controls were set at 100%. statistical evaluation was carried
out with a least significance (lsd) test to compare the tp control with the various
treatment groups. in case of significance, this test was followed by pair-wise t tests
using the mean square for error.

sexual differentiation (feminizatioflirilization test)
pregnant rats were treated s.c. with  xxxd1946xxx  (0.1,0.3, 1,3, or 10 mg/animal/
day) or  xxxd1786xxx  (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, or 10 mg/animal/day) on days 17 to 20
p.c. day 1 of pregnancy was identified by the presence of sperm in the vaginal plug.
six mother animals were treated in each dosage group. the vehicle control group
consisted of 12 animals. the animals were sacrificed on day 23 p.c. for morphological
evaluation, the fetuses were fixed in bouin solution. for histological studies, a 2-3mm slice was cut out of the middle of the fetuses and embedded in paraffin. sexual
differentiation was assessed in serial sections through the internal sexual organs as well
as through the urogenital sinus (ugs) after hematoxylin-eosin staining. qualitative
parameters taken were the type of perineal region, the presence of ventral glandar
lamella and the presence of prostate anlagen. quantitative parameters were the anogenital distance and the length of the ugs which were evaluated with a videoplan
system (mop am 02/hp9815a; kontron, japan). mean and standard deviation were
calculated for each group. in addition, multiple variance analysis was performed.

evaluation of long- term antimineralocoriicoid activity in female rats
rats weighing 210-240 g were ovariectomized on day 1. from day 1 to 30 they
were fed a low-sodium diet containing 0.014% sodium (altromin 1324; altromin
gmbh, germany). from day 9 to 29, groups of 6 animals were treated s.c. with
 xxxd1946xxx  or spironolactone (1,3, or 10 mg/animal/day). ten animals treated with
vehicle served as controls. urine was collected for 24 hrs on days 9, 10, 12, 16, 19,
23, 26 and 30. thereafter the animals were sacrificed. blood samples from the
tetrobulbar plexus were taken under ether narcosis at 8:oo a.m. on day 5 (pretreatment)
and day 30 (one day after the last treatment). then urine concentration of sodium
and potassium ions was determined by flame photometry. serum aldosterone was
determined with a commercial radioimmunoassay (biermann, germany). treatment
effects were evaluated against the control with the dunnet test. in cases of an overall
significant difference painvise comparison between individual treatment and control
groups was carried out with the wilcoxon test. sodium and urine excretion was
evaluated by area under the curve (auc) analysis (kruskal-wallis test).

glucocorticoid/antiglucocorticoidactivity in rats
adrenal weight stimulation test

female spf-wistar rats (schering ag, berlin) weighing 240 g were treated with
5 mg  xxxd1946xxx /animal p.0. or s.c. or vehicle on 36 days within six weeks. the
animals were sacrificed on the day after the last treatment and the adrenals were
dissected. their fresh weight was determined and normalized to 100 g body weight.
for statistical evaluation multiple variance analysis was performed.
thymolytic/antithyrnolyticactivity test
juvenile male rats (han:wist) weighing 100-130 g were obtained from moellegard breeding center (denmark). animals were adrenalectomized on day 1 of the
experiment and randomly assigned to the different dose regimens in groups of 7 to
10. to evaluate thymolytic effects, the animals were treated s.c. on days 6 to 9
with  xxxd1946xxx  (10 mg/animal/day), mifepristone ( xxxd2643xxx ; 10 mg/animal/day),
dexamethasone (0.01 mg/animal/day) or vehicle alone. antithymolytic effects were
evaluated by s.c. application of dexamethasone (0.01 mg/animal/day) and either the
vehicle or one of the test compounds ( xxxd1946xxx , mifepristone or cyproterone
acetate at doses of 1, 3, or 10 mg/animal/day) on days 6 to 9. the animals were
sacrificed on day 10. thymus wet weights were determined and normalized to 100
g body weight. thymolysis experiments were evaluated by calculating the percentage
suppression of the thymus weight (control = 100%). antithymolysis experiments
were evaluated by calculating the drug-induced inhibition of the dexamethasoneinduced thymus weight suppression (given in %). dexamethasone-induced thymus
weight suppression was regarded as 100%. for statistical analysis the 95% confidence
intervals were calculated using fjeller’s theorem.

estrogenic activity in rats
rats (han:wist; moellegard breeding center, denmark) weighing between
200 and 230 g were ovariectomized on day 1. on day 10, the animals received a
single dose of  xxxd1946xxx  (10 mg/animal) or 17p-estradiol(o.l p,g/animal). vaginal
smears were investigated by light microscopy 48, 54 and 72 hrs after treatment. the
animals were sacrificed immediately thereafter. autopsy was performed and uterine
wet and dry weight was determined.

results
receptor binding studies
the receptor binding profile of  xxxd1946xxx  was found to be qualitatively very
similar to that of progesterone (table1).  xxxd1946xxx  binds to the rabbit pr with
high affinity (rba value: 40%). the rba value of progesterone is slightly higher

the reference compounds were progesterone for the pr, r 188 1 for the ar, dexamethasone
for the gr, aldosterone for the mr, and 17p-estradiol for the er. the rba value for the
reference compounds was arbitrarily designated 100%. n.c.: no competition.

(100%). both progestogens show low affinity to the rat prostate ar as documented
by the 0.6% rba values for  xxxd1946xxx  and 1.4% for progesterone, respectively.
the 11% rba value of progesterone indicates considerable affinity to the rat gr,
whereas  xxxd1946xxx  has only low binding affinity (rba value: 1%).  xxxd1946xxx 
and the reference compound aldosterone bind to the mr with high affinity (rba
value: 100%);the rba value of progesterone is even higher (200%).neither  xxxd1946xxx  nor progesterone shows measurable affinity to the rat er.

transactivation assays
since  xxxd1946xxx  besides binding to the pr shows affinity to the ar, the gr
and the mr, the effects of this progestogen on ar-, gr- and mr-mediated induction
of transcription were investigated, in order to obtain additional information about its
pharmacodynamic profile and the molecular mechanism of action. the effects of
 xxxd1946xxx  on receptor-mediated reporter gene transcription were compared with
those of progesterone.
to determine the androgenic or antiandrogenic activity of  xxxd1946xxx , steroid
receptor-free cv-1 cells, stably transfected with the rat ar (rar) and a reporter
plasmid containing the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (pmmtv-cat) were
used." ar-mediated agonistic activity was investigated by treating these cells with
increasing amounts of either  xxxd1946xxx  or progesterone, as illustrated in figure
1a. as a positive control for ar-mediated reporter gene induction, cells were cultured
in the presence of the synthetic androgen  xxxd2631xxx . to study ar-mediated inhibition
of reporter gene induction, cells were treated with 0.5 nmoyl  xxxd2631xxx  and, in addition,
with increasing amounts of either  xxxd1946xxx  or progesterone. the antiandrogen
 xxxd1786xxx  was used as positive control for reporter gene inhibition. as
shown in figure1a, neither  xxxd1946xxx  nor progesterone showed any androgenic
activity. on the other hand, both  xxxd1946xxx  and progesterone strongly inhibited
androgen-dependent transcription in a dose-dependent manner, progesterone being
the somewhat more potent antiandrogen (fig.1b).
cv-1 cells transiently transfected with the human gr (phgo) and pmmtvcat served to determine the glucocor&coidand antiglucocorticoid action of drospire-

muhn et az.:  xxxd1946xxx 

321

none and progesterone. transiently transfected cv-1 cells were treated with dexamethasone (dex) as a positive control for gr-mediated reporter gene transcription
(fig.2a). the antiprogestin  xxxd2643xxx , which is known to exhibit antiglucocorticoid
activity, was used as a positive control for cat inhibition (fig.2b). unlike  xxxd1946xxx , which was devoid of glucocorticoid activity, progesterone showed weak glucocorticoid action (fig.2a). both compounds were weak antagonists of gr-mediated
transcription (fig.2b).
finally, mineralocorticoid and antimineralocorticoid activity of  xxxd1946xxx  and
progesterone was investigated by transiently transfecting the human mr (prshmr)
and pmmtv-cat into cos 1 cells. as a positive control for mr-mediated cat
induction, the transiently transfected cos 1 cells were cultured in the presence of
the mineralocorticoid aldosterone (fig.3a). as a positive control for reporter gene
inhibition, the antimineralocorticoid zk 91587 was used (fig.3b). both  xxxd1946xxx 
and progesterone weakly induced reporter gene activation (fig.3a). in addition, both
compounds strongly inhibited the aldosterone-induced cat activity (fig.3b). these
data illustrate the prominent antimineralocorticoid activity of the two progestogens.
investigations into the progestogenic activity of  xxxd1946xxx  in vivo
the progestogenic potency of  xxxd1946xxx  was analyzed and compared to that
of other progestogens in a variety of animal models in different species.
endometrial transformation test in the rabbit

following subcutaneous and oral administration of a daily dose of 0.3 mg  xxxd1946xxx /animal (corresponding to approx. 0.25 mg/kg/day) over 5 days, a marked transformation of the endometrium was detected.'*
in the dose range from 0.1 to 0.3 mg/animal s.c. (corresponding to approx. 0.080.25 mg/kg/day s.c.), endometrial reactions occurred at the threshold level (mcphail
value of 1.5; see ref. 19). thus the progestogenic potency of  xxxd1946xxx  in the
rabbit is in the range of that of  xxxd2751xxx  acetate (see ref. 20). the relative
progestational potency of  xxxd1946xxx  in comparison to that of various other progestogens is given in table2.
inhibition of ovulation in rats

upon s.c. application to rats,  xxxd1946xxx  inhibited spontaneous ovulation in the
rat with an ids0 in the dose range of 0.3 to 1.0 mg/animal/day (corresponding to
approx 2.1 to 7.0 mg/kg/day; see table
3). this suggests that the antiovulatory
potency of  xxxd1946xxx  is of the same order as that of  xxxd2751xxx  acetate (see
ref. 18). qualitatively similar results have been obtained in mice.
upon p.0. application to cyclic rats,  xxxd1946xxx  inhibited ovulation at doses
above 0.3 mg/animal/day, the half-maximal effect being reached at 1 mg/animal/day.
under these conditions,  xxxd1946xxx  is about a third as potent as  xxxd1786xxx 
(cpa).

maintenance of pregnancy in rats

progestogen substitution in combination with an appropriate dose of estrone leads
to maintenance of an existing pregnancy in ovariectomized rats.
the pregnancy maintenance rate in rats was 95.7% with a 4-day subcutaneous
application of 10 mg  xxxd1946xxx  (corresponding to about 50 mgkglday s.c.). in
this test,  xxxd1946xxx  was as effective as subcutaneously administered cyproterone
acetate (see fig.4 and ref. 10). qualitatively similar results have been obtained in
mice.
after p.0. application to ovariectomized pregnant rats,  xxxd1946xxx  also efficiently maintained pregnancy (82.9% maintenance) with a split dose of 0.5 mg/
animal 6 times a day. application of a single dose (1 x 3 mgfanimallday) had no

compound which has been demonstrated in rats (data not shown).

antigonadotropic effecr of  xxxd1946xxx  in adult male cynomolgus monkeys
in cynomolgus monkeys, orally applied  xxxd1946xxx  (4 mgkglday on five days)
showed strong antigonadotropic activity. there was a significant reduction of serum
testosterone (fig.5) and lh levels (not shown) as compared to vehicle controls. in
this respect,  xxxd1946xxx  was considerably more potent than spironolactone at a
dose of 40 mgkglday p.0. this result clearly demonstrates that the progestogenic
potency of  xxxd1946xxx  is distinctly higher than that of spironolactone.
anabolic/androgenic effect in the rat
castrated male rats were treated with  xxxd1946xxx  (10 mg/animal/day, corresponding to about 100 mgkdday) for 12 days (table

substance  xxxd3327xxx  caused a marked increase in the weight of the
accessory sex organs (seminal vesicles, prostate) at a dose of 0.1 mg/animal/day s.c.
(corresponding to approx. 1.0 mglkglday s.c.). thus,  xxxd1946xxx  did not show any
androgenic properties in rats.

antiandrogenic activity of  xxxd1946xxx 
antiandrogenic effect in castrated, testosterone-substituted rats

androgen substitution maintains the function of the accessory sex glands in
castrated animals in a dose-dependent manner. substances with antiandrogenic properties inhibit this effect.
like  xxxd1786xxx ,  xxxd1946xxx  (0.1 to 10 mglanimauday s.c. corresponding to about 1 to 100 mg/kg/day administered for 7 days) caused a distinct dosedependent inhibition of the growth of the seminal vesicles and the prostate (fig.6a
and b) induced by concurrent administration of  xxxd3327xxx  (0.1 mg/
animavday s.c.). in this test,  xxxd1946xxx  was about a third as antiandrogenic as
 xxxd1786xxx .
similarly, upon p.0. application to castrated and  xxxd3327xxx -treated
male rats, both  xxxd1786xxx  and  xxxd1946xxx  induced a dose-dependent reduction of seminal vesicle and prostate weight (data not shown). at the highest dose tested

growth was inhibited by 87.0% and 74.5%, respectively.
effect on sexual differentiation (feminizationnirizizationtest in the rat)

treatment of pregnant animals with androgenic substances in the vulnerable phase
of sexual differentiation leads to development of a number of internal and external
genital organs in a masculine direction in female fetuses (virilization). in male fetuses,
on the other hand, exposure to antiandrogens which overcome the physiological
function of testicular androgens, leads to female differentiation of external and internal
genitalia. most sensitive to hormone effects are the external genitalia and the urogenital
sinus (ugs; ref. 14).
investigation of male fetuses showed that subcutaneous administration of  xxxd1946xxx  to pregnant rats (3 and 10 mg/animal/day from the 17th to the 20th day of
pregnancy) led to a decrease in anogenital distance and to a shortening of the ugs
(table5). cpa (3 and 10 mg/animal/day) had a more pronounced effect on the
anogenital distance and a significant effect on the ugs length was already found at
a dose of 1 mg/animal/day.  xxxd1946xxx  and cpa were also observed to have a
feminizing effect on the prostate anlage, the perineal region and the ventral glandar
lamella; cpa proved to be more potent in this respect. no effect on the internal
genitalia (gonads, gonoducts, descensus testis) was found with either compound. in
conclusion, the feminizing activity of  xxxd1946xxx  on male rat fetuses was a third
to a tenth as pronounced as that of cpa,depending on the target organ.
neither  xxxd1946xxx  nor  xxxd1786xxx  had any masculinizing effect on
female fetuses as the two compounds are devoid of androgenic activity (data not
shown).

i. the animals were treated daily with  xxxd1946xxx  or spironolactone from day 9 to 29.
urine was collected for 24 hrs on days 9,
10, 12, 16, 19, 23, 26, and 30. sodium and

potassium levels were determined by flame
photometry. n = 6 animals/group except for
vehicle control (n = 12 animaldgroup).

evaluation of long-term antimineralocorttcoid activity of  xxxd1946xxx 
in female rats
a single dose of  xxxd1946xxx  has already been shown to have a potent natriuretic
effect in rats.’ specifically, it was about eight to ten times as powerful as spironolactone. the investigations reported here explored the persistence of the antimineralocorticoid effect on repeated application to ovariectomized rats.
ovariectomized rats were treated for 21 days with various doses of  xxxd1946xxx 
or spironolactone (0.1, 1, or 10 mg/animal/day).  xxxd1946xxx  was more potent than
spironolactone in increasing the na+/k+excretion rate on the first day of treatment
(fig.7). however, as judged from the increased serum aldosterone levels at the end
of the experiment (fig.8), counterregulation was induced by both the compounds.
this may well explain the rapid regression of the antimineralocorticoid effect of
spironolactone after the initial treatment phase and the smaller reduction found with
 xxxd1946xxx . a dose of 10 mg  xxxd1946xxx /animal/day resulted in sustained stimulation of the na+/kt excretion ratio, however. thus  xxxd1946xxx  is to be regarded as
a long-term antimineralocorticoid on repeated application of 10 mg/animal/day.

glucocortkoid and antiglucocorticoid activity
the adrenal gland is very sensitive to changing acth levels. glucocorticoids,
which inhibit acth secretion, lead to a progressive loss in organ weight. adrenal
weight is stimulated by treating the animal with antiglucocorticoids.
gluco- and antiglucocorticoid activity was assessed by six weeks’ application of
5 mg  xxxd1946xxx /animal/day s.c. or p.0. to intact male rats. no change in adrenal
weight was to be observed (for comparison see adrenal weight data in table4),
which indicates that  xxxd1946xxx  is devoid of gluco- and antiglucocorticoid activity.
another sensitive assay of gluco-iantiglucocorticoid activity is the regression of
thymus weight in adrenalectomized juvenile rats. application of  xxxd1946xxx  at a
dose of 10 mg/day s.c. for four days did not show any significant suppression of
thymus weight (table6), whereas thymus involution was stimulated considerably
by dexamethasone at 0.01 mg/animal/day. this result confirms that  xxxd1946xxx  is
devoid of glucocorticoid activity.
the antiglucocorticoid activity of  xxxd1946xxx  was also evaluated in comparison
with mifepristone ( xxxd2643xxx ) and cpa. mifepristone caused a dose-dependent inhibition in dexamethasone-stimulated loss of thymus weight with an idsoof about 10
mglanimallday s.c. (fig.9).  xxxd1946xxx  produced 9.8% inhibition at a dose of 10
mg/animal/day and in this respect was comparable to cpa. the antiglucocorticoid
activity of  xxxd1946xxx  can be seen to be negligible.

evaluation of estrogenic activity
the estrogenic activity of  xxxd1946xxx  was assessed using the allen-doisy test.
uterine wet and dry weight, which is increased by estrogenic compounds in a dosedependent manner, was also analyzed.  xxxd1946xxx  (10 mg/animal) produced no
sign of estrogenic effects on the vaginal epithelium. a marginal stimulation of rat
uterine wet but not dry weight was noted (table 7). in contrast, 17p-estradiol induced
a full vaginal reaction and a distinct increase in uterine wet and dry weight. these
data indicate that  xxxd1946xxx  has no estrogenic activity.

comparison of progesterone’s and  xxxd1946xxx ’s pharmacodynamic
profile with that of various other progestogens
there are presently two main classes of synthetic progestogens in therapeutic use:
 xxxd2303xxx  acetate derivatives ( xxxd2554xxx , cyproterone
acetate etc.) and nortestosterone derivatives ( xxxd2751xxx , levonorgestrel etc.).
while in recent years newly developed progestogens mostly represented variations
on a classical theme, namely,  xxxd2751xxx ,  xxxd1946xxx  represents a completely
novel type of progestogen: it is the only compound that combines all the pharmacodynamic properties of progesterone: progestogenic, antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity occur within a very similar dose range. the pharmacodynamic properties
of some widely used progestogens are compared with those of  xxxd1946xxx  and
progesterone in table 8.

discussion
the experimental data reveal that  xxxd1946xxx  is a compound with progestogenic
(rabbit, rat, monkey), antiandrogenic (rat, monkey; transactivation experiments in
vitro) and aldosterone antagonistic (rat; transactivation experiments in vitru) activity.
 xxxd1946xxx  binds to the  xxxg1737xxx  with high affinity (rba = 40%;
progesterone = 100%;see also ref. 12). its progestogenic activity was evaluated in
a variety of animal models. the results obtained in the rat (maintenance of pregnancy)
and in the rabbit (endometrial transformation) suggest a relative progestational potency
of the same order as that of  xxxd2751xxx  acetate.  xxxd1946xxx  also shows antigonadotropic activity; its antiovulatory potency in the rat was found to be comparable to
that of  xxxd2751xxx  acetate (for comparison see ref. 18).
 xxxd1946xxx  binds to the  xxxg183xxx  with low affinity (rba = 0.6%; r
1881 = 100%). xxxd1946xxx  has no androgenic activity in vitro as was demonstrated
by a lack of stimulation of  xxxg183xxx -driven gene transcription in a cell line
stably transfected with the  xxxg183xxx  and a reporter gene. similar results
were obtained in vivo: treatment of castrated male rats with  xxxd1946xxx  had no
influence on the weight of the accessory sex organs (seminal vesicles, prostate).
moreover, the compound had no recognizable virilization effect on the process of
sexual differentiation of female rat fetuses. these results demonstrate that  xxxd1946xxx  is devoid of any androgenic activity.
the antiandrogenic effect of  xxxd1946xxx  was investigated in a transactivation
assay in v i m . inhibition of the  xxxg183xxx -induced reporter gene activity was
dose dependent. the icso of  xxxd1946xxx  was somewhat higher than that of  xxxd1786xxx  or progesterone. in vivu, antiandrogenic activity was demonstrated by
inhibition of androgen-stimulated growth of the accessory sexual organs (seminal
vesicles, prostate) in testosterone-substituted, castrated male rats. the potency of
 xxxd1946xxx  in vivo was found to be about a third that of  xxxd1786xxx  on s.c.
application. the results obtained in vivo together with the data concerning inhibition of
androgen-stimulated transactivation in vitro imply that the antiandrogenic activity of
 xxxd1946xxx  is based on a functional blockade of the  xxxg183xxx .
 xxxd1946xxx  also showed antiandrogenic activity in rats upon oral application
of a daily dose of 3 to 10 mg/animal. this contrasts with the results obtained in the
maintenance of pregnancy test, where the dose had to be split into six applications
per day in order to obtain maximal activity. these divergent results are probably due
to the relatively short half-life (but high bioavailability; data not shown) of  xxxd1946xxx  in rats. whereas maintenance of pregnancy apparently requires continuously
high blood levels, the occurrence of antiandrogenic effects is less affected by the
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1946xxx  in this species.
 xxxd1946xxx  induced feminization in male fetuses following treatment of pregnant rats at a dose of 3 mglday during the vulnerable period of sexual differentiation.
this is a property it has in common with all potent anti androgen^.'^.'^ consistent
with the antiandrogenic potencies of the two compounds,  xxxd1946xxx  was about a
third to a tenth as active in this respect as  xxxd1786xxx . based on these data and
taking into consideration the clinical experience with pharmacological preparations
containing cpa, feminization of human fetuses at ovulation-inhibitory doses of
 xxxd1946xxx  can be excluded.

 xxxd1946xxx  binds to the  xxxg1602xxx  with high affinity (rba =
100%; aldosterone = 100%). as shown here, the compound is apotent antimineralocorticoid in vitro and in vivo. this is an outstanding characteristic and has not been
described for any other synthetic progestogen at therapeutically relevant doses. the
natural hormone progesterone, however, exhibits this activity (refs. 5-9 and data
shown here). the antimineralocorticoid properties of  xxxd1946xxx  and progesterone
were demonstrated in transactivation studies in vitro where both compounds potently
antagonized aldosterone-induced reporter gene activation. progesterone was somewhat more potent in this respect. some weak aldosterone agonistic activity seen in
the transactivation assay with both progesterone and  xxxd1946xxx  was not observed
in vivo (data not shown). the antimineralocorticoid activity of  xxxd1946xxx  and
progesterone has also been analyzed in the rat distal colon in vitro, where both
compounds inhibited aldosterone-stimulated transepithelial sodium transport. l7 as
was reported earlier,’ short-term studies with adrenalectomized, aldosterone-substituted rats indicate that  xxxd1946xxx  stimulates sodium and water excretion in a dosedependent manner. it is now shown that the compound also exhibits long-term
antimineralocorticoid activity in rats upon daily treatment for 21 days with 10 mg/
animal. under these conditions, the compound stimulated the sodiudpotassium
excretion ratio over the entire treatment period while spironolactone became ineffective after the first or second application. this is probably due to the induction of
counterregulation: the increased serum aldosterone levels observed under the treatment apparently completely overcame the natriuretic effect of spironolactone but not
that of  xxxd1946xxx .
additional endocrine pharmacological investigations showed that  xxxd1946xxx 
is devoid of estrogenic, glucocorticoid and antiglucocorticoid activity as can be seen
from the absence of an influence on vaginal epithelial cornification in rats, adrenal
weight changes in rats, and thymus regression in adrenalectomized, glucocorticoidsubstituted rats, respectively.
 xxxd1946xxx  is expected to act as a progestogen with aldosterone antagonistic
and antiandrogenic properties in women. it has already been shown that  xxxd1946xxx 
exhibits strong central and peripheral progestational activity in humans (ref. 2 and
oelkers et al., unpublished results) which renders the compound suitable for a variety
of applications including oral contraception and hormone replacement therapy.
 xxxd1946xxx  has also been shown to exhibit antimineralocorticoid activity on oral
application to women.’
 xxxd1946xxx ’s lack of androgenicity and its antiandrogenic activity suggest that
it may have positive effects in women suffering from symptoms of androgenization
such as acne and seborrhea. its antimineralocorticoid activity is expected to result
in reduced weight gain and in an amelioration of other side effects possibly related
to estrogen-induced water retention, such as breast tension, nausea and headache,
quite common complaints among women taking estrogens or ocs.
the absence of aldosterone antagonistic activity in the synthetic progestogens
available today may also be connected with the discrete increase in blood pressure’”**
that is observed in a number of oc users. a beneficial effect of  xxxd1946xxx  on
blood pressure development is to be inferred from the results of a study involving
4 weeks’ treatment of sponfuneous2yhypertensive ruts (shr) with equipotent progestogen doses of  xxxd1946xxx , progesterone, levonorgestrel and  xxxd1786xxx .

muhn et al:  xxxd1946xxx 

333

whilst the last two compounds caused an increase, with  xxxd1946xxx  a slight reduction
of blood pressure was regi~tered.~~
in this respect the effect of  xxxd1946xxx  may
best be compared with that of a slightly sodium-reduced diet.
in conclusion,  xxxd1946xxx  is a novel progestogen with antimineralocorticoid
and antiandrogenic characteristics. it is devoid of androgenic, estrogenic, gluco- and
antiglucocorticoid properties.  xxxd1946xxx  thus exhibits an innovative pharmacological profile, which is more closely related to that of the natural hormone progesterone
than is that of any other synthetic progestogen in use today. with such a profile
 xxxd1946xxx  is expected to provide a number of additional health benefits both in
oc users and hormone replacement therapy recipients.

summary
 xxxd1946xxx  ( xxxd1946xxx ; 6/3,7p, 15p,16p-dimethylen-3-0~017a-pregn-4-ene21,17-carboiactone) is a novel progestogen under clinical development.  xxxd1946xxx 
is characterized by an innovative pharmacodynamic profile which is very closely
related to that of progesterone. potential applications include oral contraception,
hormone replacement therapy and treatment of hormonal disorders.
the pharmacological properties of  xxxd1946xxx  were investigated in vitro by
receptor binding and transactivation experiments and in vivo in appropriate animal
models.
in qualitative agreement with progesterone, the compound binds strongly to the
progesterone and the  xxxg1602xxx  and with lower affinity to androgen
and glucocorticoid receptors. there is no detectable binding to the  xxxg730xxx .
steroid hormone agonistic and antagonistic activities of progesterone and  xxxd1946xxx  were compared in transactivation experiments. individual steroid hormone receptors were artificially expressed together with a reporter gene in appropriate cell lines.
both hormones were unable to induce any  xxxg183xxx -mediated agonistic
activity. rather, both progesterone and  xxxd1946xxx  distinctly antagonized androgenstimulated transcriptional activation. likewise, both compounds only very weakly
activated the  xxxg1602xxx  but showed potent aldosterone antagonistic
activity.  xxxd1946xxx  did not induce  xxxg1601xxx -driven transactivation.
progesterone was a weak agonist in this respect.
 xxxd1946xxx  exerts potent progestogenic and antigonadotropic activity which
was studied in various animal species. it efficiently promotes the maintenance of
pregnancy in ovariectomized rats, inhibits ovulation in rats and mice and stimulates
endometrial transformation in the rabbit. furthermore,  xxxd1946xxx  shows potent
antigonadotropic, i.e., testosterone-lowering activity in male cynomolgus monkeys.
the progestogenic potency of  xxxd1946xxx  was found to be in the range of that of
 xxxd2751xxx  acetate.
the majority of clinically used progestogens are androgenic.  xxxd1946xxx , like
progesterone, has no androgenic but rather an antiandrogenic effect. this property
was demonstrated in castrated,  xxxd3327xxx  substituted male rats by a
dose-dependent inhibition of accessory sex organ growth (seminal vesicles, prostate).
in this model, the potency of  xxxd1946xxx  was about a third that of cyproterone
acetate.

 xxxd1946xxx , like progesterone, shows antimineralocorticoid activity, which
causes moderately increased sodium and water excretion. this is an outstanding
characteristic which has not been described for any other synthetic progestogen
before.  xxxd1946xxx  is eight to ten times more effective in this respect than spironolactone. the natriuretic effect was demonstrable for at least three weeks upon daily
treatment of rats with a dose of 10 mg/animal.
 xxxd1946xxx  is devoid of any estrogenic, glucocorticoid or antiglucocorticoid
activity.
in summary,  xxxd1946xxx , like progesterone, combines potent progestogenic with
antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity in a similar dose range. due to its
innovative pharmacological profile,  xxxd1946xxx  is anticipated to give rise to a series
of additional health benefits for both users of oral contraceptives and recipients of
hormone replacement therapy.
