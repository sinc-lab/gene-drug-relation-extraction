four double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, crossover studies were performed in
nine a.sthmatic patients to evaluate pj'adrenoeeptor selectivity and the duration of effect
of  xxxd2155xxx . one study with cumulatively increasing doses of  xxxd2155xxx  and salbutamol showed that with the inhaled route,  xxxd2155xxx  was 5-15 times more potent than
salbutamol with respect to bronchodilation. in a second study, 6 ng  xxxd2155xxx  and 0.1
mg salbutamol were given for comparison of effect duration. five hours after salbutamol
inhalation the fev, values were back to basal. eight hours after  xxxd2155xxx  inhalation
about 75 % of the maximum bronchodilation remained and the fevj was significantly
higher than after salbutamol inhalation. by oral route, a study with cumulatively
increasing doses showed that as a bronchodilator  xxxd2155xxx  was about 50 times more
potent than salbutamol. the same potency difference was seen for increase of heart rate
and decrease of diastolic blood pressure, indicating that the clinical selectivity for p^adrenoceptors is equal for the two drugs. in a fourth study comparable doses by oral
route did not show any difference in the duration of bronchodilation. we conclude that
inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  is 5-15 times more potent than salbutamol. inhaled  xxxd2155xxx 
produces longer duration of bronchodilation, with clinically relevant bronehodilation for
at least 8 h. the prolonged duration of  xxxd2155xxx  was not seen with oral treatment.

p^-adrenoceptor agonists are considered a cornerstone of current asthma therapy (7, 20, 21).
the main route of administration is via inhalation, with several advantages over systemic
treatment (14, 25). one ofthe disadvantages of
the currently available p2'adrenoceptor agonists
is their relatively short duration of effect, about
4 h after inhalation (4, 6, 8, 15, 23). this has
made it impossible to retain a continuous effect
during the night without repeated inhalations.
 xxxd2155xxx  fumarate is a new catecholamine
analogue possessing a potent |3-adrenoceptor
agonist effect. selectivity studies in isolated
tissue samples have shown that  xxxd2155xxx 
fumarate is at least as p2-adrenoceptor selective
as salbutamol and terbutaline (5, 11). it has
been shown in in vivo animal experiments to

have a high potency and long duration of effect;
longer than salbutamol. the potency was about
50 times higher than that of salbutamol (10).
japanese studies in asthmatics have indicated
that oral treatment with this drug produces
longer effect duration than salbutamol (13, 18).
to our knowledge no studies have been performed to evaluate the effect duration of inhaled
treatment with this drug.
a study with the following objectives was
therefore planned:
1. to establish equipotent bronchodilating
doses for  xxxd2155xxx  and salbutamol when
given by inhaled and oral route, and evaluate the p^-adrenoceptor selectivity by comparing the effects on heart rate and skeletal
muscle tremor.

 xxxd2155xxx , a new pj-adrenoceptor agonist
2. to study the duration of bronchodilation for
 xxxd2155xxx , compared with salbutamol given
by inhaled and oral route.

methods
experimental design

four studies were performed as double-blind,
double-dummy, randomized, crossover comparisons between  xxxd2155xxx  and salbutamol in
patients with stable endogenous asthma. in two
studies cumulatively increasing doses of the
drugs were given to establish the dose-response
curves for bronchodilation, circulatory effect
and skeletal muscle tremor with  xxxd2155xxx  and
salbutamol by oral or inhaled route. in two
other studies one dose of each drug, shown in
the dose-response experiments to be equipotent
doses, were given and the ventilatory capacity
was studied during a period of 8 h for both
inhaled and oral treatment.

patients

nine patients with endogenous asthma in a
stable phase and reproducible obstruction of the
airways when off treatment were studied (table
1). in the two oral studies the same eight asthmatics took part. the patients showed a reversibility of fev, of 20-63% during the salbutamol dose-response experiment. they were

265

included in the study after giving informed consent to participation in the study, which had
previously been approved by the ethics committee at the university of gothenburg.
inhaled pj'^^renoceptor agonist therapy and
inhaled anticholinergics were withdrawn at least
12 h before the start of an experiment. oral p,,adrenoceptor agonist therapy given in slowrelease preparations was withdrawn 24 h and
theophylline derivatives 36 h before each experiment, eorticosteroids, inhaled or oral, were
unchanged during the study period.
if the difference in each study between mean
basal values for one individual was greater than
15%, that day's experiment was repeated.
experimental details
1. inhaled cumulative dose-response study.

the

patients arrived at the laboratory  xxxd2274xxx .30 a.m.
after a light breakfast without coffee or tea at
home 1 h earlier. after 50 and 70 min rest in a
semi-recumbent position, basal measurements
of the following variables were performed:
1) heart rate from continuous ecg recordings.
2) blood pressure by the cuff method.
3) skeletal muscle tremor from a single plane
accelerometer according to a previously
described method (24).
4) forced expiratory volume in 1 s (fev,)
measured with a collin's survey spirometer.
at least two recordings were made and the
highest value was used for calculation.

after basal measurements, four increasing
doses of each drug were given at 70-min intervals, as a pilot study had shown that an almost
maximum bronchodilating effect was seen within 1 h for both drugs. fifteen min after each
inhalation, all measurements except blood pressure were performed, and 30 min after inhalation a new spirometry was performed and 60
min after inhalation all measurements were
repeated. the patients did not eat during the
time of the experiment.
the doses chosen for  xxxd2155xxx  were 3 ng in
one inhalation, 9 ^g given as 3 inhalations, 27
|ig given as 2 inhalations of 12 ng and one of 3
ng, and 84 ng given as 7 inhalations of 12 ng
each. for salbutamol the doses were 100 ng in
one inhalation, 300 ng in 3 inhalations, 900 ng
as 9 inhalations and 2,800 ng as 7 inhalations
from powder aerosol capsules (400 ng ventoline
rotahaler®). matching placebo canisters/capsules without active drug were given together
with the active drug to ensure blindness. doses
with several inhcilations were given as alternating inhalations between placebo and active
drug. the same spacer device, volumatic®, was
used for inhalations of both drugs to decrease
inhalation errors and to improve bronchial
deposition. a special adapter for the  xxxd2155xxx 
dose inhalers was built in the laboratory. the
inhalations were supervised by a trained technician and the patients rinsed their naouths with
water after each inhalation.

performed 15, 30 and 60 min after inhalation
and then exactly once every hour up to 8 h after
inhalation. after the 8-h measurement the
patient inhaled l25 mg terbutaline (5 inhalations). the inhalations of  xxxd2155xxx  and salbutamol were performed as in the dose-response
experiment and administered via a volumatic®
spacer device.
3. oral cumulative dose-response study. after basal
measurements performed as in the inhaled
cumulative study, three increasing doses of
each drug were given at 130-min intervals, as
a pilot study showed that the maximum effect
was achieved within 2 h after both drugs
given by the oral route. 30, 60, 90 and 120
min after each dose all measurements were
repeated. 130 min after the third dose inhalations of terbutaline were given (1.25 mg), and
fev, was measured 15 min after inhalation.
the patients were given a light lunch 70 min
after the second oral dose and soup 70 min
after the third dose.
the doses for  xxxd2155xxx  were 40 ng, 120
ng and 360 ng, and for salbutamol 2 mg, 6
mg, and 18 mg. matching placebo tablets
were given together with the active drug.

this is true both for oral and inhaled treatment.
this shows that the 32"^drenoceptor selectivity
of  xxxd2155xxx  is the same as that of salbutamol.
to make it possible to evaluate the duration
of bronchodilation, it is important to use equipotent bronchodilating doses (16, 22). there
was a good possibility of arriving at equipotent
doses in this study as the duration study was
performed in the same patients as in the
cumulative dose-response study, from which the
doses were chosen. in order not to overestimate
the duration of the new drug in the inhaled
duration study, we chose a dose of  xxxd2155xxx 
which tended to be lower than the salbutamol
dose.
however, with inhalation there was marked
prolongation ofthe bronchodilating effect. after
8 h, about 75% ofthe maximum bronchodilating effect still remained. this study did not
evaluate how long the effect lasted after 8 h.
some other studies indicate that the effect lasts
up to 12 h (1, 19).
the mechanism behind this prolonged effect
is not fully understood. either it can be
explained by local pharmacokinetic properties
in the airways or by the general pharmacokinetic properties of the drugs. a surprising fmding
in this study with regard to the duration of the
effect of  xxxd2155xxx , was the discrepancy between the oral and inhaled route, although a
study of this question had not been intended.
this discrepancy could have several explanations, but could also be due to local pharmacokinetic properties. with oral treatment,
the drug reaches the smooth muscle directly
from the serosaj side, whereas with inhalation
the drug has to pass the epithelium. it has been
shown that there is a difference between the
potency of a bronchodilating drug when administered on the serosal side, compared with intraluminal administration (28). most drugs show a
considerably higher potency when given on the
serosal side (12, 27). however, recent experiments show that this discrepancy is less pronounced with some of the new pj'^drenoceptor
agonists, such as  xxxd2155xxx  (12). thus, it
seems likely that there is a difference in the local
pharmacokinetics of these drugs in the airway
which merits further investigation.

one speculation about the sustained effect of
another new inhaled pj'^gonist, salmeterol, has
been the possible presence of an exoreceptor for
these drugs in the airway smooth muscle (2).
another factor which is correlated to the duration could be the lipophilicity, as shown recently (12).  xxxd2155xxx  is more lipophilic than
salbutamol, which could increase the unspecific
binding of the drug to the cell membrane,
thereby establishing a depot of the drug in the
vicinity of the receptor.
systemic pharmacokinetic properties of the
drugs do not seem to influence the prolonged
duration of bronchodilating effect seen with
inhaled  xxxd2155xxx , as the serum half-life of
 xxxd2155xxx  and salbutamol is about the same
(17). other pj-adrenoceptor agonists, e.g. clenbuterol, have a very long plasma half-life without any substantial prolongation of the duration
of bronchodilation with inhaled route.
to sum up, this study shows that  xxxd2155xxx 
is a potent bronchodilator; by inhalation 5-15
times more potent than inhaled salbutamol, and
that inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  produces a considerably
longer lasting bronchodilatory effect. this last
effect is of great clinical interest as these results
indicate that the drug may give good bronchodilatory effect during the night, and that the
number of hours between doses can be
increased, thus perhaps resulting in better compliance.
