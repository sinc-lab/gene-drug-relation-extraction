summary: the sympathetic nervous system plays a major
role in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension and is
mediated by the a and p receptors. the a receptor is divided into two types, a i and a2, based on response to
epinephrine and norepinephrine. a ,-adrenergic receptors
have a high affinity for drugs such as pmzosin, doxazosin, and terazosin, which act to reduce blopd pressure by
selective blockade of the receptor. these agents provide
a rational approach to the treatment of hypertension by
correcting elevated total peripheral resistance, the fundamental hemodynamic abnormality in essential hypertension. in contrast, early a-adrenergic receptor blockers
nonselectively blocked both a iand a2receptors and were
unsuitable as antihypertensive agents because they induced
tachycardia and patients developed a tolerance to them
rapidly. a,-adrenergic blockers also have beneficial effects on plasma lipoproteins, tending to decrease levels
of triglycerides and cholesterol and increase levels of highdensity lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol and the hdl
cholesterol/total cholesterol ratio. p-adrenergic blockers,
such as propranolol and atenolol, have been shown to have
an adverse effect on the lipid profile by tending to increase
levels of triglycerides and decrease hdl cholesterol. a
number of mechanisms contribute to these effects, in particular, adrenergic modulation of  xxxg1337xxx  and
the triglyceride secretion rate. doxazosin has been shown
to increase the activity of ldl receptors, which may be
partly responsible for its beneficial effect on plasma lipids

and lipoproteins. doxazosin is different from other aiadrenergic inhibitors in that its maximal hypotensive effect occurs within 5 or 6 hours after administration in acute
dosing studies, making first-dose postural hypotension unlikely, and its long half-life provides 24-h blood pressure

introduction
the pathogenesis and maintenance of essential hypertension has been associated with a number of factors, but
hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system plays a
major role. a manifestation of this hyperactivity is a generalized increase in total peripheral resistance, the fundamental hemodynamic abnormality in essential hypertension. i
this abnormality appears even in patients who have no
evidence of increased peripheral resistance at rest, but
who, on exercise, demonstrate inappropriately high systemic resistance at a given level of increase in cardiac output.2 other mechanisms prominent in the development of
systemic hypertension include increased vascular sensitivity to catecholamines or to other vasoactive substances,
hyperactivity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system,
or a reduced level of local or circulating vasodilator substances.
medithe actions of the sympathetic nervous system
ated by either of two receptor types, known as a or 0 .
these receptors are defined by their responses to stimulation by catecholamines: a-adrenergic receptor sites
respond primarily to epinephrine and norepinephrine and
less so to  xxxd2401xxx ; the converse is true of padrenergic receptors. the a-adrenergic receptors are further subdivided into two distinct types: a i, most of which
are located postjunctionally on the vascular smooth muscle cell, and a*,which are located prejunctionally on the
sympathetic nerve ending (fig. l).4 blockade of the ai-

fig.i schematic representation of the a-adrenergic receptor subtypes on peripheral nerve endings (presynaptic) and vascular smooth
muscle (postsynaptic). contraction of vascular smooth muscle is
mediated primarily by a,receptors, whereas a2receptors located
on peripheral nerve endings inhibit norepinephrine (ne) release,
thereby providing local feedback control of sympathetic vasoconstriction. recent data indicate that some vascular postsynaptic receptors are of the a2subtype. [modified from colucci and braunwald,

adrenergic receptor results in relaxation of vascular smooth
muscle and a reduction in blood pressure.
the prejunctional a,-adrenergic receptor is quite different from the a,-adrenergic receptor and is involved in the
maintenance of vascular tone by mediating the release of
norepinephrine. when the prejunctional a,-adrenergic
receptor is stimulated by norepinephrine, additional release
of norepinephrine is inhibited. release of norepinephrine
may also be reduced by norepinephrine or epinephrine entering the synaptic cleft from the bloodstream. blockade
of the a2-adrenergic receptor results in an opposite effect;
namely increased release of norepinephrine. the prejunctional a,-adrenergic receptor, therefore, forms part of a
feedback loop that maintains sympathetic activity and subsequent vascular tone.
the a-adrenergic receptors also differ in their speciticities for antagonist agents. the a,-adrenergic receptors have
a high affinity for drugs such as  xxxd3000xxx , doxazosin, and
terazosin, and a low affinity for drugs such as clonidine
or yohimbine. the converse is true for a,-adrenergic receptors: extremely low affinity for  xxxd3000xxx  and doxazosin and
a high affinity for clonidine or yohimbine.’

these agents are phenoxybenzamine and  xxxd2914xxx ,
which are nonselective a-adrenergic receptor blockers.
these agents block both the postjunctional receptor on the
vascular smooth muscle cell, which is desired to reduce
blood pressure, and the prejunctional receptor on the sympathetic nerve ending. the increased levels of
norepinephrine resulting from a,-adrenergic blockade may
attenuate the desired postjunctional blockade, thus d e c m ing the degree of blood pressure reduction. furthermore,
the increase in norepinephrine in the systemic circulation
may result in tachycardia and tremulousness. these early agents were clinically unsuitable for use in antihypertensive therapy because of their tendency to induce
tachycardia and rapid tolerance buildup.,
a different mechanism of action is at work with selective a-adrenergic receptor blockers. these agents selectively block the a,-adrenergic receptor but do not affect
the prejunctional a,-adrenergic receptors. consequently,
unwanted increased levels of norepinephrine are avoided
and thus undesirable cardiac and systemic effects of increased norepinephrine release are circumvented. the use
of a selective a-adrenergic receptor blocker makes physiologic and therapeutic sense in the management of hypertension.
the different physiologic effects of selective versus nonselective a blockade in a blood-perfused dog kidney preparation can be seen in figure 2. in this study,2  xxxd3000xxx ,
injected into the blood supply of a blood-perfused dog kidney preparation, did not increase overflow of
norepinephrine when compared with control;  xxxd2914xxx , however, significantly increased norepinephrine
ovefflow when compared with control (p<o.ool). furthermore,  xxxd3000xxx , unlike  xxxd2914xxx , does not potentiate the effects of sympathetic nerve stimulation. when

cardiac sympathetic nerves in the dog were stimulated to
increase heart rate,  xxxd3000xxx  did not potentiate the stimulation, whereas  xxxd2914xxx  increased the effect.*
doxazosin and terazosin have been shown to have a
similar a,-adrenergic receptor selectivity as  xxxd3000xxx . in
fact, when the affinity for ai-and a,-adrenergic receptors among doxazosin,  xxxd3000xxx , and  xxxd2914xxx  were
compared in a rabbit pulmonary artery, doxazosin was
shown to have greater selectivity than  xxxd3000xxx  for the a,adrenergic receptor as opposed to the a,-adrenergic receptor., at concentrations >
m, xxxd3000xxx  caused an increase in efflux of tritiated norepinephrine. doxazosin,
however, at concentrations <
m had no effect on efflux of norepinephrine (table i). it is unclear if these
differences have any clinical relevance.

hemodynamic effects of alpha,-adrenergic
receptor blockers in hypertensive patients
recent studies in humans suggest that postjunctional a,adrenergic receptors in resistance vessels significantlycontribute to the maintenance of vascular tone resulting in
hypertension. selective a,-adrenergic receptor blockers,
such as pmosin, doxazosin, and terazosin, inhibit adrenergically dependent vascular tone without disrupting overall sympathetic function, thus offering significant clinical advantages over earlier nonspecific agents. because
postjunctionala,-adrenergic receptors located on arteriolar smooth muscle are the major determinants of sympathetically mediated vascular tone, selective blockade
with a,-adrenergic receptor blockers is a rational approach
to lowering blood pressure by correcting elevated total
peripheral resistance, the major hemodynamic defect in
essential hypertension.
this effect was demonstrated in a study of 14 patients
with moderate essential hypertension who received intravenous injection of doxazosin 0.5-1 mg over 3

minutes.7 mean resting supine arterial pressure after 1 h
was lowered by 8 % from baseline at rest supine, by 12%
at rest sitting, and by 10% on a bicycle ergometer (at 100
w). mean total peripheral resistance index was reduced
by 5 % at rest supine, 9% at rest sitting (p<o,oi), and
14%during bicycle ergometric exercise (p<o.001). heart
rate increased by 5 % , indicating that only slight reflex
tachycardia occurred despite the rapid reduction in blood
pressure. cardiac index remained unchanged at rest and
increased by 4% with exercise (pc0.05). primarily as a
result of the minor increase in heart rate. the investigators concluded that doxazosin normalizes central
hemodynamics, both at rest and during exercise, in hypertensive patients. doxazosin reduced blood pressure by
reducing total peripheral resistance without reducing cardiac output.
in this same study,7patients were placed on once-daily
oral doxazosin (mean dose 6.5 mg; range 2-16 mg). after one year of treatment, reductions in total peripheral
resistance index of 19% ,20%, and 18% were seen at rest
supine, at rest sitting, and following bicycle ergometric
exercise, respectively. resting supine cardiac index increased slightly but was unchanged at rest sitting and following bicycle ergometry. although the doses employed
in the acute and chronic phases of the study were not the
same, the investigators felt that a similar acute and chronic
hemodynamic response was achieved with doxazosin.

renal effects of alphal-adrenergic receptor
blockers in hypertensive patients
since selective a,-adrenergic receptor blockers do not
affect a,-receptor-mediated negative feedback control of
norepinephrinerelease from sympatheticnerve terminals,
these agents effectively lower blood pressure without
markedly affecting renal function. this was demonstrated in a clinical study of hypertensive patients who received
doxazosin in either stepwise doses of 0. i , 0.3, 1. 3, and
10 gg/kg/min with each infusion lasting 10 minutes or
fixed doses of 1 gg/kg/min.*a third group served as controls and were infused only with glucose. only minor
changes in renal perfusion and m i n secretion were seen
in patients receiving doxazosin. the investigatorsconcluded that although a,-adrenergic receptors in the kidney can
influence renal vasoconstriction and inhibition of renin
release, the quantitative impact is minor.

sive response to a single dose (intravenous or oral) of doxazosin occurs much later (5-6 h) than that of  xxxd3000xxx 
(0.5-1 h).27 thus, doxazosin may be less likely than
 xxxd3000xxx  to cause symptomatic postural hypotension after the first dose. the short (2.5 h) half-life of  xxxd3000xxx 
requires multiple daily dosing. the half-lives of doxazosin and terazosin are significantly longer: 10-12 h in
single-dose studies. in multiple-dose studies that measured plasma concentrations beyond 24 h, the half-life of
doxazosin was 22 h. 28 the pharmacokinetics of doxazosin appear to make the drug suitable for once-daily administration that may achieve 24-h blood pressure control in many hypertensive patients.28
this 24-h blood pressure control of doxazosin was
demonstrated in a recent study of 40 patients with mild
to moderate hypertension who were treated with doxazosin (mean final daily dose in 20 patients of 13.1 mg) or
placebo.29 in the 9th week of double-blind treatment,
blood pressure measurements were taken throughout the
day during 24-h hospitalization and compared with similar measurements taken during the 2-week placebo runin period. inpatient results showed that doxazosin significantly reduced mean standing and supine diastolic blood
pressure at most intervals, including 24 h after administration (p < 0.05 vs. placebo). for outpatients, mean 24-h
postdose reductions from baseline with doxazosin were
12.9/11.9 mmhg for standing systolic/diastolic blood
pressure and 9.9/10.0 mmhg for supine blood pressure.
figure 3 shows that the reductions from baseline for standing and supine blood pressure were significantly greater
with doxazosin than with placebo (p=0.002 and p=o.ool,
respectively). furthermore, heart rate in both the standing and supine positions was unchanged 24 h after administration of doxazosin.
in a multicenter comparative study of doxazosin and terazosin as once-daily therapy for hypertension, therapeutic success, defined as a decrease in standing diastolic
blood pressure to < 90 mmhg and a reduction of at least
10 mmhg in standing diastolic blood pressure, was
achieved in 19 of 26 (73%) patients receiving doxazosin
and in 18 of 28 (64%)patients in the terazosin group.i4
patients tended to require lower doses of doxazosin than
terazosin to achieve therapeutic success. results are summarized in table 111.

the effects of adrenergic agents on plasma
lipoprotein metabolism
in addition to its contribution to the development of
hypertension, the sympathetic nervous system affects
lipoprotein metabolism. the adrenergic influence on
lipoprotein metabolism may be of primary importance in
the development of atherosclerosis and may mediate
changes in lipids during long-term treatment with certain
antihypertensive agents. 0-adrenergic blockers, such as
propranolol, atenolol, and metoprolol, have been shown

to increase plasma triglyceride levels and decrease highdensity lipoproteins (hdl) without generally affecting
low-density lipoproteins (ldl).30labetalol, which is an
a- and 0-adrenergic blocker, appears to be lipid neutral.
 xxxd3000xxx  not only lacks adverse effects on plasma lipids,
but has been shown to increase hdl levels, decrease total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and increase the
hdl cholesterol/total cholesterol ratio. 30 similar beneficial effects have been seen with doxazosin (see section
below).
a number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the influence of adrenergic antagonists on lipid
metabolism.3 1 the first involves adrenergic modulation
of  xxxg1337xxx , a key enzyme involved in the breakdown of triglycerides into free  xxxd2154xxx , via constriction of the precapillary sphincter tone in microcirculatory
vessels. blockade of the a-adrenergic pathway leads to
increased capillary flow and greater availability of
 xxxg1337xxx , which ultimately results in decreased
plasma levels of triglycerides and triglyceride-rich
lipoproteins. in contrast, 0-adrenergic blockers (e.g.,
propranolol) inhibit  xxxg1337xxx  activity, leading to
reduced clearance of triglycerides (fig. 4).32prazosin has
been shown to increase  xxxg1337xxx  activity in hyper-

by the uptake of chylomicron remnants, plasma free fatty
acids, glucose metabolites, and norepinephrine. additional
factors include inhibition via hormonal manipulation by
epinephrine, insulin, and glucagon. 3 1 studies in humans
show that during periods of hypoglycemic stress, production of vldl and triglycerides is reduced.35the extent
to which the triglyceride levels are reduced correlates with
urinary epinephrine release but not norepinephrine. this
suggests that @-adrenergicreceptors decrease the production of vldl, which agrees with the increase in vldl
levels seen with propranolol, a @-adrenergicblocker. 29
this was demonstrated in a study in which rats received
 xxxd3000xxx , propranolol, or no treatment (control).36 hepatic
triglyceride secretion rate in rats receiving  xxxd3000xxx  was
lower than in control rats and those treated with
propranolol. triglyceride secretion rate correlated with
plasma triglyceride concentration. these data also suggest a direct effect of a-or @-adrenergicblockers on the
triglyceride secretion rate in the liver.
a similar study was performed comparing the effects
of doxazosin and propranolol on lipoprotein lipases and
plasma lipids in rats.37in rats fed a normal diet, doxazosin increased heart  xxxg1337xxx  activity by 14%,
while propranolol decreased it by 20% (pc0.05 compared
with the doxazosin group). in rats fed a cholesterol-rich
diet, doxazosin still increased heart  xxxg1337xxx  activity by 5 % , adipose tissue lipase by 14%, and hepatic
lipase by 13% (fig. 5). propranolol decreased all three
parameters by 12%, 20%, and 9% respectively. the
difference between the two treatment groups reached
statistical significance for heart and  xxxg1329xxx 
(pco.05). although neither agent had an effect on total
plasma cholesterol or triglyceride content in the
cholesterol-fed rats, the doxazosin group had significant-

ly increased hdl cholesterol levels (+24%)when compared with controls and the propranolol group (p ~0.05).
the same mechanism that decreased triglyceride secretion in this study may also explain the increase seen in
hdl cholesterol levels. the decrease in  xxxg1329xxx  activity was partially reversed by doxazosin, and since  xxxg1329xxx  may play a role in uptake of hdl cholesterol
by the liver, this action may be enhanced by the a iinhibition induced by doxazosin and not by 0-adrenergic inhibition. the investigators concluded that doxazosin may
produce changes in lipids and lipoproteins that are favorable to more efficient cholesterol transport to the liver and
out of the body. they noted that this interpretation needed scientific confirmation and that whether these effects
were mediated by adrenergic receptors or hormones is still
unknown.37

are controlled by the number and activity of ldl receptors located on liver and other tissue cells and by the rate
of endogenous ldl synthesis. ldl is primarily derived
by catabolism of vldl. mechanisms by which adrenergic antagonists affect production of vldl may also be
responsible for changes in ldl levels.31 data from a study
with doxazosin suggest that blockade of the a-adrenergic
pathway can promote or increase clearance of ldl.38in

lipoprotein (i-ldl) by cultured skin
fibroblasts. fibroblasts were cultured in a monolayer in medium
with 10% fetal calf serum. different concentrations of doxazosin
were added before 24 h of incubation at 37°c. values for association of [lz5i]ldlat 4°c (--m--),
association of [1251]ldlat

tor activity determined as association or degradation of
[ '2sl]ldlat 37°c. after incubation with doxazosin, the
two  xxxg1318xxx  indices increased by 57% (association)
and 45% (degradation). a slight increase in ldl receptors independent of the processing of ['251]ldlwas seen.
the mechanism underlying the increase in  xxxg1318xxx 
activity is unknown.
since doxazosin increases  xxxg1318xxx  activity, it
would be expected that the drug would reduce ldl and
total cholesterol levels. in one study, 20 weeks of antihypertensive therapy with doxazosin in 42 patients with
mild to moderate essential hypertension resulted in significant decreases in total plasma cholesterol (8.9%)and
ldl cholesterol (16.9%) over pretreatment values
(p < 0.01). 39

seen. hdl cholesterol
levels tended to increase, but this trend did not reach
statistical significance. as mentioned above, a possible
mechanism for these favorable changes in blood lipids may
be increased  xxxg1318xxx  activity induced by doxazosin. similar trends were seen in a comparative study of
terazosin with the diuretic  xxxd2606xxx .l6 patients
randomized to terazosin experienced a 5 % drop in ldl
plus vldl after 14 weeks of therapy while there was a
7% increase in patients receiving the diuretic. hdl was
unchanged in the terazosin group and down 1.3% in the
methychlothiazidegroup. total cholesterol, triglycerides,
and total cholesterol/hdl ratio also decreased in the terazosin group.

conclusions
although blockade of a-adrenergic receptors has long
been an approach to lowering blood pressure, it was only
with the introduction of selective a,-adrenergic receptor
blockers that this mechanism could be clinically utilized.
selective blockade of postjunctional a -adrenergic receptors results in inhibition of postjunctional u,-receptormediated vasoconstriction without affecting the atreceptor-mediated negative feedback control of
norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerve terminals.
a ,-adrenergic receptor blockers are effective in reducing
blood pressure without reflex tachycardia or other adverse
effects on the sympathetic nervous system. these agents
act hernodynamically by reducing elevated total peripheral
resistance, the fundamental hemodynamic abnormality in
essential hypertension. adrenergic mechanisms that act

,

upon plasma lipoprotein metabolism favor a,-adrenergic
blockers, which, contrary to p-adrenergic blockers, do not
adversely affect the lipid profile and may even induce
beneficial changes in blood lipids.
