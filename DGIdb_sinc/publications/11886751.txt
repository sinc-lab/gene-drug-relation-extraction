abstract
using computational analysis, a novel superfamily of l-strand-rich domains was identified in the  xxxg1441xxx  and
several other proteins from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. these mosc domains contain an absolutely conserved cysteine and occur
either as stand-alone forms such as the bacterial yiim proteins, or fused to other domains such as a  xxxg1562xxx -like catalytic domain in
 xxxg1441xxx . the mosc domain is predicted to be a sulfur-carrier domain that receives sulfur abstracted by the
 xxxd3047xxx -dependent  xxxg1562xxx -like enzymes, on its conserved cysteine, and delivers it for the formation of diverse sulfur^metal
clusters. the identification of this domain may clarify the mechanism of biogenesis of various metallo-enzymes including molybdenum
cofactor-containing enzymes that are compromised in human type ii xanthinuria. ß 2002 federation of european microbiological

1. introduction
the molybdenum cofactor (moco) consists of molybdopterin and hexavalent molybdenum chelated via two
thiol groups. the hexavalent molybdenum is additionally
coordinated by either two oxo or by an oxo and a sul¢do
ligand respectively [1]. the sul¢do-containing version of
the moco is utilized by a variety of enzymes from both
prokaryotes and eukaryotes such as  xxxg2431xxx , purine hydroxylase ii, pyridoxal oxidase and  xxxg168xxx  [1,2]. the human metabolic disorder, type ii
xanthinuria appears to stem from a fundamental defect in
moco biogenesis and is comparable to similar defects in
moco metabolism that are observed in both animal systems like drosophila melanogaster and microbial models
like aspergillus nidulans [3]. over the past four decades,
genetic analyses in these systems have suggested that the
maroon-like (ma-l) gene in d. melanogaster and the hxb
of a. nidulans are the equivalents of the gene mutated in
type ii xanthinuria [4^8]. on the basis of the inactivation
of several distinct enzymes due to the disruption of these
genes, it has become clear that they encode moco sulfu-

rases (mos) that transfer sulfur to molybdenum, forming
the sul¢do version of moco [6]. however, the mechanisms of moco biosynthesis in bacteria and archaea
are even less understood.
recently, the molybdenum sulfurase genes, ma-l, hxb
and the human gene mutated in type ii xanthinuria have
been cloned and characterized and shown to be orthologs
of each other [9^11]. they were shown to encode proteins
with a  xxxd3047xxx  (plp)-binding  xxxg1562xxx -like catalytic domain with a conserved cysteine [11]. this allowed a
direct comparison with the  xxxg1562xxx -like proteins that are involved in the biosynthesis of metal^sulfur clusters in bacteria and predicted a similar mechanism for moco sulfuration [11]. however, the eukaryotic mos proteins are
multi-domain proteins with additional uncharacterized cterminal domains that are not found in the  xxxg1562xxx  proteins,
suggesting that there may be unexplored, functional complexities. while it has been suggested that the c-terminal
extension of mos may have a role in interacting with the
substrate [11], there has been no speci¢c investigation of
its potential functions. using pro¢le sequence analysis and
contextual information arising from domain fusions and
predicted operon organization in diverse bacterial genomes, we show that the c-terminal domain of mos proteins de¢nes a novel, ancient domain superfamily that may
have a generic role in the biosynthesis of metal^sulfur

clusters across a wide range of organisms. the identi¢cation of this domain provides a potential clari¢cation for
the actual mechanism of sulfur transfer by proteins like
mos and might result in a better understanding of the
biochemical basis of metal^sulfur cluster biogenesis.
2. materials and methods
the non-redundant (nr) database of protein sequences
(national center for biotechnology information, nih,
bethesda, md, usa) was searched using the blastp
program [12]. pro¢le searches were conducted using the
psi-blast program with either a single sequence or an
alignment used as the query, with a pro¢le inclusion expectation (e) value threshold of 0.01, and were iterated
until convergence [12,13]. previously known, conserved
protein domains were detected using the corresponding
position-speci¢c scoring matrices (pssms) that were constructed using psi-blast [14]. multiple alignment was
constructed using the t_co¡ee program [15], followed
by manual correction based on the psi-blast results.
protein secondary structure was predicted using a multiple
alignment as the input for the jpred program [16]. sequence-structure threading was performed using the hybrid fold-prediction method that combines multiple alignment information with secondary-structure prediction [17],
and the 3d-pssm method [18]. the phylogenetic tree was
made using maximum-likelihood (ml) and minimum-evolution methods [19,20]. brie£y, this process involved the
construction of a minimum evolution tree using the
fitch program of the phylip package, followed by
local rearrangement using the protml program of the
molphy package to arrive at the ml tree. the statistical signi¢cance of various nodes of this ml tree was assessed using bootstrapping (protml rell-bp) with 10 000
replicates. the operons were predicted in silico by using
very stringent criteria : (a) two genes in a predicted operon
must have the same orientation ; (b) they must be separated from predicted stop to start by no more than 50
nucleotides ; (c) they must share common transcription
initiation and termination signals. a compilation of gene
neighborhoods for the completed genomes is available

through the cog system: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
cog/ [21].
3. results and discussion
several well-conserved, completely uncharacterized, protein domains with a widespread phyletic distribution are
emerging as a result of genome-sequencing e¡orts [21].
predicting their biochemistry and structures might help
in uncovering, as yet unexplored, fundamental functions
that are common to a range of biological systems. as a
part of our survey of such uncharacterized, mobile domains, we chose those that are associated with small molecule binding- and enzymatic domains [22], and attempted
function/structure predictions using a combination of sequence pro¢le methods and contextual information obtained from their domain architectures and gene neighborhoods. the yiim protein from escherichia coli typi¢ed
one family of proteins that was identi¢ed in these studies.
from one to four orthologs of yiim per genome are
found in diverse bacteria such as k- and q-proteobacteria,
campylobacter jejuni, actinomycetes, deinococcus radiodurans and gram-positive bacteria. a pro¢le search seeded
with yiim from e. coli, using the psi-blast program
[12], recovers not only its orthologs but also a variety of
other uncharacterized proteins from bacteria, eukaryotes
and the archaeon halobacterium salinarium in the ¢rst
four iterations of psi-blast and the mos in the sixth
iteration. the alignments of yiim with the mos correspond to the extreme c-terminus of the latter, almost the
full length of the former, and have statistically signi¢cant
e values (1034 ^1036 ) at the point of primary detection.
transitive, reciprocal searches initiated with selected proteins detected in these searches consistently recovered a
conserved region of about 125^170 residues in approximately the same set of proteins, including yiim. pairwise
alignments produced by these psi-blast searches
showed a similar pattern of conservation, occurring in
di¡erent contexts, in all these proteins, suggesting that
this region de¢nes a novel mobile domain. we named it
the mosc domain after the proteins  xxxg1441xxx  cterminal domain.
c

fig. 1. a multiple alignment of the mosc domain was constructed using t_co¡ee [15] and realigning the sequences by parsing high-scoring pairs
from psi-blast search results. the jpred secondary structure [16] is shown above the alignment with e representing a l-strand, and h an k-helix.
the 85% consensus shown below the alignment was derived using the following amino acid classes : hydrophobic (h: alicvmyfw, yellow shading);
the aliphatic subset of the hydrophobic class are (l: alivmc, yellow shading); aromatic (a: fhwy, yellow shading); small (s: acdgnpstv, green)
and the tiny subset of the small class are (u: gas, green shading) and polar (p: cdehknqrst, blue). a `n' or `g' denotes the conserved n the
small class and g of the tiny class, respectively. the completely conserved `c' is reverse-shaded in red. the limits of the domains are indicated by the
residue positions on each side. the numbers within the alignment are poorly conserved inserts that have not been shown. the di¡erent families are
shown on the right. the sequences are denoted by their gene name followed by the species abbreviation and genbank identi¢er. the species abbreviations are: hsp ^ halobacterium sp. nrc-1, atu ^ agrobacterium tumefaciens, bh ^ b. halodurans, bs ^ bacillus subtilis, cac ^ clostridium acetobutylicum, cc ^ caulobacter crescentus, cj ^ c. jejuni, dr ^ d. radiodurans, ec ^ e. coli, hi ^ h. in£uenzae, mlo ^ mesorhizobium loti, mt ^ mycobacterium

the n- and c-terminal boundaries of the mosc domain were established using the yiim and mos protein
where it occurs at the extreme n- and c-termini, respectively, and a multiple alignment was constructed using the
t_co¡ee program [15], followed by manual correction
based on the psi-blast results (fig. 1). the multiple
alignment shows several conserved patches of hydrophobic
residues and an absolutely conserved cysteine residue situated closer to the c-terminal end of the domain. consistent with this conservation pattern, the secondary-structure prediction using the combined jpred method [16]
suggests a l-strand-rich fold with a couple of isolated khelical elements (fig. 1). however, sequence-structure
threading through the pdb database, with the combined
fold-recognition algorithm [17] and the 3d-pssm method
[18], does not indicate any close relationship with any
known l-strand-rich fold.
the absolutely conserved cysteine in the mosc domain
is reminiscent of the analogous conservation of a cysteine
in the active site of the thioredoxin and rhodanese superfamilies [23^25]. members of both these superfamilies, especially those of the latter one, have been implicated in the
synthesis of fe^s clusters, through mobilization of sulfur

with their active cysteine [26^28]. multiple yiim-like proteins are found in most free-living bacteria with complex
metabolism that are known to synthesize their own cofactors like moco and have several metal-cluster-containing
metabolic enzymes (fig. 1). interestingly, the mosc domain is found fused to nadh oxidoreductase-related proteins with 2fe^2s ferredoxin domains in q-proteobacteria
(fig. 2). in bacillus halodurans, the yiim ortholog appears
to form an operon with the anaerobic nitrate reductase
[29] that contains a ferredoxin domain and also utilizes
moco. in haemophilus in£uenzae, yiim appears to occur
in an operon with a protein that contains the cysteine-rich
sec-c domain (seca-c-terminal domain, l.a. and v.a.,
unpublished) that appears to form a metal-binding cluster
[30]. these observations, taken together with its presence
in the molybdenum sulfurases, suggest that the mosc
domain might play a critical role in the formation of diverse metal^sulfur clusters, with the conserved cysteine
playing an active role in this process.
a more exact indication of this function is provided by
the fusion of the mosc domain to the  xxxg1562xxx -like plpbinding catalytic domain. these  xxxg1562xxx -like enzymes, unlike
the related plp-dependent aminotransferases, contain a

fig. 2. phylogenetic relationships of the mosc domain containing proteins along with the domain architectures are shown. the phyletic pattern of
each family is shown, along with the number of proteins (if there are more than one). the species abbreviations are as shown in fig. 1. 3-alpha is the
conserved compact tri-helical domain predicted to have a topology similar to the helix^turn^helix domains found in the c-termini of a subset of the
yiim-family proteins. beta-barrel is the distinct n-terminal domain found in the mos family that is predicted to adopt a l-barrel-like structure.

conserved cysteine in their catalytic domain [11,31]. this
conserved cysteine in the catalytic domain is necessary for
the abstraction of sulfur from a free donor cysteine, in
process converting the donor cysteine to alanine (fig. 3).
 xxxg1562xxx -like proteins show a low level of reconstitution of
their catalytic cysteine in vitro and it is likely that additional factors help in regenerating by accepting the abstracted sulfur [31]. in the original studies on the nifslike proteins, it was proposed that the abstracted sulfur
in the s0 -oxidation state was most likely transferred to a
carrier protein [31] that in turn speci¢cally transfers it to
certain apo-proteins with sulfhydryl acceptors or to a metal center-like molybdenum. while rhodanese and the acylcarrier protein have been suggested as potential s0 -carrier
proteins, this carrier protein has not been actually identi¢ed, either for mos or other  xxxg1562xxx -like proteins [31]. based
on the conserved cysteine and the domain architectures
that it displays, we propose that the mosc domain is
the actual carrier domain that accepts s0 from  xxxg1562xxx -like
domains and delivers it to speci¢c targets (as in the scheme
shown in fig. 3). in c. jejuni, yiim appears to be in an
operon with the disul¢de bond isomerase/thioloxidoreductase, dsbd [32,33] of the thioredoxin family. this raises
the interesting possibility that the mosc domain might
also have a second function in the thiol-dependent redox
pathway, with its active cysteine performing a role similar
to the analogous cysteine of thioredoxin-fold thioloxidoreductases [33].
an evolutionary classi¢cation of this domain-superfamily was established using both blast score-based clustering and construction of a phylogenetic tree using minimum evolution, ml and neighbor-joining methods
[19,20]. two major families were identi¢ed, namely those

59

typi¢ed by yiim and forms closer to it than the rest, and
those by mos c-terminal domains and their immediate
relatives. a third minor family comprising few bacterial
proteins, such as yuad, was clearly identi¢ed (fig. 2).
the yiim-like family is found only in bacteria and several
members contain a distinct extension that is predicted to
form a compact tri-helical domain similar in topology to
the helix^turn^helix domains. all members of the moslike family show a distinct domain, n-terminal to the
mosc domain, that is undetectable elsewhere in standalone form, and is predicted to adopt a l-barrel-like structure (fig. 2). this particular domain may have speci¢c
roles in interaction with substrates of these enzymes. the
mosc domain in the mos-like family has a second conserved cysteine, n-terminal to the universally conserved
cysteine (fig. 1). this pattern, with proteins of the same
superfamily having either a single or two closely cysteines,
is again reminiscent of the thioredoxin superfamily : the
peroxiredoxins typically have a single cysteine whereas
the classic thioredoxins contain two conserved cysteines
[25]. members of this family are represented in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes like proteobacteria, streptomyces and in a solitary archaeon halobacterium.
the eukaryotes show two versions of mos-like family:
forms like flj22390, with just the mosc domain and the
n-terminal l-barrel domain, and the mos proper, that
have a further n-terminal fusion of a  xxxg1562xxx -like domain.
the prominent presence of the mos-like family only in
the proteobacteria (figs. 1 and 2) and absence in most
archaea, taken together with the presence of a predicted
transit peptide in all the eukaryotic flj22390-like forms,
suggests that the eukaryotes acquired it from the pro-mitochondrial endosymbiont. the phylogenetic trees strongly

suggest that shortly after entering the eukaryotes, the
mosc protein underwent duplication with one copy retaining the primitive architecture (represented by
flj22390-like proteins) and the other copy undergoing
domain fusion to form the mos. the flj22390-like
group most probably continues to function as a sulfurcarrier protein in the synthesis of metal^sulfur clusters in
the eukaryotic mitochondrion, as it did in the ancestral
proteobacterium.
4. conclusions

[7]

[8]

[9]

[10]

here, we identify an ancient conserved domain that is
predicted to function as a potential sulfur (s0 )-carrier domain in the biosynthesis of metal^sulfur clusters. it suggests a possible uni¢ed mechanism by which sulfur is
transferred to molybdenum in the biogenesis of the
moco in both bacteria and eukaryotes. this may also
help in understanding the human metabolic disorder, type
ii xanthinuria, that involved disruption of the moco
biosynthesis. additionally, like the thioredoxins, this domain may also function as a thioloxidoreductase. the detection of the extensive mosc domain superfamily suggests a speci¢c role for di¡erent members of this family in
the synthesis of speci¢c metal^sulfur complexes in diverse
contexts. one such, typi¢ed by yiim, could play this role
in diverse bacteria, while another typi¢ed by flj22390
and mos could carry out this function in the eukaryotic
mitochondria and cytoplasm. the identi¢cation of this
domain might help in the understanding of a new class
of bio-metal metabolism proteins that belong to a superfamily completely distinct from the previously identi¢ed
rhodaneses and thioredoxins.
