abstract
quantitative in situ hybridization was utilized to map the distribution and abundance of the serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine
transporter žsert, dat and net, respectively. mrnas. sert mrna was quantified within the dorsal raphe ždr. and the median
raphe žmr., dat mrna within the ventral tegmental area -substantia nigra žvta-sn. region and net mrna within the locus
coeruleus žlc.. sert mrna expression within the raphe complex was organized into distinct subregional domains with the rank order
of mrna abundance: ventromedial žvm. dr ) dorsomedial ždm. dr ) mr ) dorsolateral ždl. dr. the relative abundance of dat
mrna also varied across subregions: sn pars compacta) the parabrachial pigmentosis žpbp. ) the intrafascicular žif.. the effects of a
‘binge’ paradigm of cocaine administration on sert, dat and net mrna abundance were compared in the brains of behaviorally
sensitized rats. cocaine significantly decreased the abundance of the sert mrna within the dldr and dat mrna abundance within
the snc and the pbp, and increased the abundance of the net mrna within the lc. finally, correlational analysis indicated that
post-cocaine levels of dat, sert and net mrnas were not associated with cocaine-induced sensitization. q 1997 elsevier science

1. introduction
the transporters for serotonin ž5-ht., dopamine žda.
and norepinephrine žne. žthe sert, dat and net,
respectively. are naq- and cly-coupled plasma membrane
glycoproteins responsible for the reuptake of 5-ht, da
and ne following their release, thereby terminating their

actions in the brain w1,3x. thus, the activity of the transporters is thought to determine the duration and magnitude
of post-synaptic responses to these neurotransmitters. interest in these transporters stems in large measure from the
fact that as a class they are molecular targets for both
antidepressants že.g. desipramine and fluoxetine. and psychomotor stimulants že.g. cocaine and amphetamine. w1,3x.
cocaine binds with high affinity to the sert, dat and
net w32x. most evidence suggests that the da projections
to the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex from the
ventral tegmental area-substantia nigra complex žvta-sn.
are integral for the behavioral activating and reinforcing
effects of cocaine w17,12,33x. in fact, the reinforcing properties of cocaine have been associated with its ability to
inhibit the dat w31x. interestingly, lesions or pharmacological manipulations of the raphe serotonergic system can
also modify the reinforcing efficacy of cocaine self-administration w5,6,21,28x žbut see w26x.. thus, dynamic interactions between da and 5ht systems and potential compensatory changes in the regulation of sert and dat gene

expression may be critically involved in the expression of
the reinforcing efficacy of cocaine self-administration behavior.
cocaine is a powerful reinforcing agent and when
abused can lead to the development of a syndrome of
addiction and dependence. in rats and monkeys the chronic
intermittent administration of cocaine leads to the gradual
manifestation of an enduring behavioral syndrome known
as sensitization, characterized by the emergence of augmented locomotor activity and repetitive stereotypic behaviors w18x. some researchers have suggested that these
behaviors are predictive of drug craving in humans w34x.
humans have been reported to abuse cocaine in extended
‘binges’, with each binge lasting 4–24 h followed by a
period of abstinence w11x. this ‘bingeing’ can lead to the
emergence of hallucinations, paranoid ideation, psychosis
and in some cases, death w36,23,27x. the fact that paranoid
ideation can be reinstated by a return to cocaine use after
years of abstinence suggests that a sensitization process
underlies their expression w16x.
while many studies have examined potential changes in
dat and sert expression following a variety of different
schedules of chronic cocaine administration žfor a review,
see w43x., few studies have employed a ‘binge’ pattern of
drug administration or have used the cellular resolution of
in situ hybridization to examine potential regional heterogeneity of cocaine responsiveness. in the present study, we
have employed a ‘binge’ schedule of cocaine administration in combination with in situ hybridization to visualize
the distribution and quantitate the abundance of dat
mrna within midbrain da cells, sert mrna within the
raphe complex and net mrna within the locus coeruleus
žlc.. in cocaine-treated rats, we also examined the correlation of the behavioral score indicative of sensitization to
the abundance of the dat, sert and net mrnas.

2. materials and methods

min following each hourly injection, each rat was rated in
their home cage žover a 30-s interval. every 6 min for 50
min. the appearance of sensitized behaviors was determined using a previously published scale w25x: 0, no
gnawing or locomotor movements; 1, walking around the
cage, sniffing over the grid žnormal locomotor activity.; 2,
more active žhyperactive., but without repetitive movements; 3, moving around the cage in a repetitive fashion;
4, very intense repetitive movements restricted to a small
area of the cage žstereotypic behaviors.. the extent of
sensitization was defined as the mean difference between
the behavioral activation scores on days 14 and 1.
2.3. tissue sectioning
the lc, dorsal raphe ždr., median raphe žmr. and
vta-sn regions were identified in coronal sections according to the atlas of paxinos and watson w24x. lc tissue
sections selected for analysis were located between y1.04
and y0.80 mm žplates 58 and 57. from the interaural line,
a region located between cranial nerve 7 and the appearance of the inferior colliculi. tissue sections containing the
dr and mr selected for analysis were from the caudal
region of the dr and the mr at f 1.00 mm from the
interaural line žplate 50.. the dr was divided into three
anatomically distinct subnuclei based on the criteria of
intensity of sert expression, cell density and anatomical
location: the dorsomedial dr ždmdr., located just below
the aqueduct of sylvius; the dorsolateral dr ždldr.,
located lateral to the dmdr; and the ventromedial subnucleus žvmdr., located dorsal to the medial longitudinal
fasciculus and immediately ventral to the dmdr. the mr
was also included in the analysis of sert expression. the
snc and vta tissue sections selected for analysis were
located between 3.2 and 3.4 mm from the interaural line
žplates 40 and 41.. using previously published criteria w15x
all cell data from the medial vta was collected from the
interfascicular nucleus žif. while that of the lateral vta
was collected from the parabrachial pigmentosis žpbp..

2.1. animals and drug administration
2.4. crna probes and in situ hybridization
male fisher rats žhilltop: initially weighing 172–195 g.
were housed in a temperature controlled animal care facility on a 12-h light–dark cycle with food and water continuously available. all animal use procedures were followed
in strict accordance with the nih guide to the care and
use of laboratory animals. rats ž n s 8 per group. were
injected i.p. with cocaine ž15 mgrkg. or vehicle in a
‘binge’ pattern w38x: 3 injectionsrday žspaced 1 h apart.
beginning at 09:30 h for a total of 14 days, followed by
decapitation 4 h after the final injection.
2.2. behaõioral analysis
the rating procedure utilized for this study is essentially
as described w9x. briefly, on days 1 and 14, beginning 5

three different cdnas were used as templates for the
synthesis of antisense crna probes in this study:  xxxd3125xxx -bp
net clone žcorresponding to bases 477–758. w39x, a 156-bp
sert clone žcomprising bases 133–287., subcloned from
a full-length sert cdna žgift from dr. randy blakely.,
and a 263-bp dat cdna žcorresponding to bases 618–
881., subcloned from a full-length dat cdna žgift from
dr. susan amara.. the specificity of these probes was
evident in the neuroanatomic specificity of the hybridization signal žfig. 1a–c. and the fact that each probe
labeled only the appropriate cell groups, but did not crosshybridize with the other monoamine cells žnot shown..
in situ hybridization using the dat, sert and net
crna probes was performed essentially as described

w2,40,41x. following decapitation, brains were immediately
frozen in isopropanol, then stored at y808c until tissue
sectioning. coronal sections ž14 m m. were cut on a cryostat, thaw-mounted on slides and stored at y808c until
use. sections were then rapidly air-dried, fixed in a solution of 3.0% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate-buffered saline, acetylated and then dehydrated
through a graded series of ethanol solutions and allowed to
air dry. tissue sections were then pre-hybridized in a
humidified incubator for 60 min at 528c in 50 m l of
pre-hybridization solution. after 1 h, pre-hybridization
solution was removed and replaced under parafilm coverslips with 25 m l of identical solution, but containing 60
žf 1.8 = 10 6 cpm. fmol of w a- 35 sxctp-labeled antisense
crna probe. after a 3.5-h incubation at 528c, the tissue
sections were treated at 378c in  xxxg1963xxx , dipped in 300
mm ammonium acetate and then dehydrated through a
graded series of alcohols, delipidated in xylene and airdried. slides were then dipped in kodak ntb-2 emulsion
at 458c and stored in light-tight desiccated slide boxes at
48c. after 4–6 days, the slides were developed in d-19,
fixed, counterstained in hematoxylin and then coverslipped
in permount. dark-field photographs were produced using
a 2.5 = or a 40 = oil objective with a zeiss photomicroscope.
2.5. data collection
for each region of interest, one tissue section per
animal was selected for quantitative analysis based on
matched rostro-caudal location. computer imaging software žimaging research, inc.. was used to quantitate silver
grain-positive cells ž n s 37–62 cellsrsection. from emulsion-coated sections containing the lc, dr, mr and the
vta-sn, as described w2,40x. briefly, transporter mrnaexpressing cells from these regions were identified under
bright-field microscopy based on the presence of clusters
of silver grains proximal to, or overlying, an identifiable
cell nucleus. cell outlines were circled manually under
dark-field illumination and the area occupied by the silver
grains divided by the total designated cell area ži.e. the
proportional area. was used as an index of transporter
mrna abundance within a particular cell. background
labeling was determined from 5 randomly selected fields
which lacked positively identified cells but were proximal
to the lc, dr-mr, and vta-snc regions selected for
analysis. background labeling amounted to less than 1% of
the labeling over regions analyzed, demonstrating high
specificity of the signal. as previously shown w2,40x, there
was no significant correlation ž r s 0.02–0.25 for different
regions. between cell size and proportional area, indicating
that cell size was not a dependent variable.
2.6. statistics
differences in the mean proportional area of transporter
expression in a particular žsub.region between cocaine-

and vehicle-treated rats was assessed with a nested design
anova using the statistica software package. a
nested design is valuable for controlling for variabilities
between rats in a group. regional heterogeneities in transporter mrna abundance were also analyzed by anova
followed by a post-hoc tukey hsd test for unequal n. the
ranked data used to rate the appearance of sensitized
behavior were analyzed with either the mann-whitney
u-test for comparisons between cocaine- and vehicletreated rats or friedmans anova for comparisons between cocaine-treated rats at two different time points.
regression analysis was used to measure correlations between dat, sert and net mrna abundance and the
behavior indicative of the degree of sensitization. the
significance level for all tests was set at p - 0.05.

3. results
3.1. heterogeneous patterns of transporter mrna abundance
the overall pattern of sert mrna distribution in the
raphe nuclei seen in the present study žfig. 1a. was in
good agreement with a previous qualitative mapping of
sert mrna expression in the rat brain w10x. visual
observation suggested that sert mrna is heterogeneously expressed within this region. the dr has been
divided previously into a dorsal and ventral tier w29x. in the
present analyses, sufficient differences in sert mrna
abundance within the dorsal tier were evident to warrant
further subdivision of the dorsal tier of the dr into a dl
and dm subregion žfig. 1a.. in the case of the dat, dat
mrna was expressed heterogeneously within the if of the
medial vta, the pbp of the lateral vta and the snc
žfig. 1b. in keeping with previous reports w35,37x. the
expression of net mrna within the lc is shown in fig.
1c. in agreement with previous observations w22x, net
mrna is homogeneously expressed in the lc, while the
ventral subcoeruleus areas contained a less dense population of similarly intensely labeled cells.
differences in sert and dat mrna abundance within
the dr-mr and the vta-sn were more readily apparent
under high magnification, as shown in the photomicrographs in fig. 2. these differences were subsequently
quantified, with the data shown in fig. 3. sert mrna
was more abundantly expressed within neurons of the
vmdr and least abundantly expressed within neurons of
the dldr žcf. fig. 2a with fig. 2b.. quantitative analyses
of subregional differences in sert mrna abundance

and cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization žnot shown..

4. discussion
the present study constitutes the first examination of
heterogeneity of sert mrna abundance within subregions of the dr-mr. heterogeneity of w 3 hxcyanoimipramine binding to the sert has been reported recently w14x,
with the same rank order of abundance reported here. it is,
at present, unclear how this heterogeneity of sert expression may relate to described differences in the morphology
and projection fields of subgroups of 5ht neurons žreviewed in w14x.. the present data demonstrating heterogeneity of dat mrna abundance within the confines of
the vta-sn corroborates earlier observations w4,7,37x that
dat mrna is least abundant within the medial vta and
greatest within the snc. in contrast, net mrna within
the lc exhibited no significant heterogeneity.
the effects of the ‘binge’ schedule of chronic cocaine
administration on the sert, dat and net transporters
were significant, albeit quite modest. two previous studies
w7,42x, utilizing cocaine administration schedules different
from that utilized here, also demonstrated cocaine-induced
decreases in the abundance of the dat mrna. to our
knowledge, this is the first report to assess the effects of
cocaine on the abundance of the sert or net mrnas
within the dr-mr and the lc, respectively. the present
data reveal that immediately following a binge regimen of
chronic cocaine, sert and dat mrna are modestly
decreased and the net mrna modestly increased. the
literature on changes in sert and dat ligand binding in
cell body and terminal forebrain regions following chronic
cocaine has been equivocal. although the discrepancies are
often attributed to differences in the dose of cocaine,
dosing schedule andror the length of treatment w43x, the
relative consistency of the data obtained in the dat in situ
hybridization studies žw4,42x and present data. suggests
other factors že.g. the class of transporter ligand used. may
be critical as well.
although the reinforcing properties of cocaine have
been associated with its ability to inhibit the dat w30x, we
found no correlation between the sensitized behavior of the
cocaine-treated rats and the abundance of any of the
transporters mrnas expressed within subregions of the
vta-sn, dr-mr and the lc. similarly, other investigators w25x did not observe any significant changes in
w 3 hxnomifensine binding to the dat within the striatum of
cocaine-sensitized rats. taken together, these data suggest
that the developing process of cocaine-induced behavioral
sensitization is not associated with changes in the abundance of the dat, sert, or net; the molecular processes underlying sensitization remain obscure w16x. the
regional differences in cocaine-induced changes in sert
and dat mrna abundance reported here may be related
