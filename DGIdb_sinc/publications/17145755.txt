ronic acid and n- xxxd2683xxx  (1, 2). ha is involved in
many physiological processes (3), such as wound healing, development, and metastasis of some cancers (4 – 8). the typical
molecular mass of the polysaccharide ranges from just a few
thousand da (tens of sugars) that are thought to be important in
cellular signaling (6) to several million da (tens of thousands of
sugars). these larger forms of ha are present throughout the
body and are particularly concentrated within the bursa of
major joints, such as the knee, where they help to provide shock
absorbance in cartilage or lubrication in synovial fluid (9, 10),
and the eye, where ha maintains structural integrity of the
vitreous humor (11). the adult human body contains ⬃15 g of
ha, of which about 5 g are turned over daily (12). partially
degraded ha perfuses from extracellular matrices (ecms) and
enters the lymphatic and vascular circulation systems, where it
is catabolized to shorter fragments. this active maintenance of
ha turnover must be efficient in order to maintain homeostatic
conditions for total body ha.
all of the other gags, including the chondroitin sulfates
(css), heparan sulfate (hs), and keratan sulfate, are linked to
core proteins (as proteoglycans) that help to form ecms, such
as the basement membranes of tissues, or structural components of organs, such as the vitreous humor. there are over 30
known core proteins that are essential for a diverse array of
functions, such as neural development, growth factor signaling,
and pathogen recognition (13). these core proteins are found
as prevalent components of tissue ecms or as specialized components needed for the development of microenvironments
that interface a specialized tissue cell type with the ecm. both
the proteoglycans and their attached gag chains may combinatorially interact with ligands and contribute to modulation of
the functional aspects of a particular microenvironment (e.g. cs
interacting with  xxxg177xxx  for uptake of ␤-very low density lipoprotein in hippocampal neurons) (14). although
numerous studies have focused on how the inhibition of some
cs proteoglycans enhances neural development, especially in
injured spinal cord models, there is very little information on
how cs and hs are catabolized. the current model is that
extracellular chondroitinases, heparinases, and proteases initially break down these gags and proteoglycans, and their final
digestion can then take place intracellularly at the local tissue

the  xxxd2289xxx  (ha) receptor for endocytosis (hare; also
designated  xxxg2211xxx  and  xxxg2211xxx ) mediates systemic clearance of
glycosaminoglycans from the circulatory and lymphatic systems
via coated pit-mediated uptake. hare is primarily found as two
isoforms (315- and 190-kda) in sinusoidal endothelial cells of the
liver, lymph node, and spleen. here we characterize the ligand
specificity and function of the large stably expressed 315-hare
isoform in flp-in 293 cell lines. like human spleen sinusoidal
endothelial cells, flp-in 293 cell lines transfected with a single
cdna encoding the full-length 315-hare express both the 315kda and the proteolytically truncated 190-kda isoforms in a ratio
of ⬃3– 4:1. the 190-kda hare isoform generated from the 315kda hare and the 315-kda hare specifically bound 125i-ha.
like the 190-kda hare expressed alone (harris, e. n., weigel,
j. a., and weigel, p. h. (2004) j. biol. chem. 279, 36201–36209), the
190- and 315-kda hare isoforms expressed in 315-hare cell
lines were recognized by anti-hare monoclonal antibodies 30,
154, and 159. all 315-hare cell lines could endocytose and
degrade 125i-ha. competition studies with live cells indicate that
190-hare and 315-hare bind ha with higher apparent affinity
(kd ⬃10 –20 nm) than  xxxd1687xxx  (cs) types a, c, d, or e.
only slight competition of ha endocytosis was observed with cs-b
(dermatan sulfate) and chondroitin. direct binding assays with the
315-hare ectodomain revealed high affinity ha binding, and
lower binding affinities for cs-c, cs-d, and cs-e. a majority of
each hare isoform was intracellular, within the endocytic system,
suggesting transient surface residency typical of an active endocytic recycling receptor.

characterization of the human 315-kda hare

190-kda hare isoform. other groups have focused on the fulllength hare in human, mouse, pig, and cattle and overlooked
the smaller isoform as a breakdown product or an experimental
anomaly. thus, confusion has arisen about this particular
receptor, including the existence of the smaller form (175 kda
in rat, 190 kda in human), where it comes from, whether it is
functional, and, if so, what the biological implications may be
(40, 41). for example, the ratio of rat 175-hare to 300-hare
in the liver is higher than in the spleen. thus, the levels of each
isoform appear highly regulated (30, 33), but it is still not known
why or how this occurs. we recently confirmed that the 190kda hhare is, in fact, a functional endocytic recycling receptor
that can mediate gag uptake in the absence of the larger 315kda hhare (37).
in this report, we stably expressed the recombinant fulllength 315-kda human hare, using cdna derived from
human lymph node, and show that a small fraction of the total
parent receptor is proteolytically cleaved to produce a functional 190-kda receptor. thus, the 315-hare expressed in stable flp-in 293 cell lines produces two receptors that bind to and
internalize ha. the secreted ectodomain of the 315-kda receptor was glycosylated; was reactive with anti-hare monoclonal
antibodies (mabs); bound ha, cs-c, cs-d, and cs-e well; and
bound more weakly to cs-b and chondroitin. when expressed
in flp-in 293 cells, most of the receptors are found intracellularly, suggesting that as the receptor cycles between plasma
membrane and endocytic vesicles, the time spent on the surface
is quite short.

level. however, in many cases, some of these gags and proteoglycan fragments will probably find their way into the lymphatic and circulatory systems, especially during injury or disease. without some type of efficient gag-clearing mechanism,
these fluid circulatory systems may get overwhelmed with large
amounts of debris derived from tissue ecms throughout the
body.
although the synthesis and catabolism of ha are generally
the most understood pathways of any of the gags, the details
of each pathway currently remain largely unknown. in the early
1980s, it was observed that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells
endocytose circulating ha (15–19). we know now that
ha䡠hare complexes are endocytosed via the clathrin-coated
pit pathway (20, 21), and their formation is cation-independent
(22), specific, and of high affinity (23, 24). like the mannose, low
density lipoprotein, and asialoglycoprotein receptors, hare is
a recycling receptor that moves through an intracellular itinerary every ⬃10 –15 min (25). this receptor system was shown to
be responsible for the physiological turnover of about one-third
of the total body ha per day (12, 26). most of the partially
degraded ha perfusing from a tissue ecm encounters this ha
receptor first in lymph nodes, which catabolize about 85% of
the ha turning over daily. the remaining 15% of the ha drains
from the lymphatics into the circulatory system and is removed
by the same receptors present in liver sinusoidal endothelium. this rapidly recycling ha receptor is also present in
high copy number in spleen, where it presumably mediates
additional, but unknown, ha/gag activities other than systemic clearance.
the primary scavenger receptor for systemic ha turnover is
hare. orthologues of this receptor are present in other mammals, including cow, pig, guinea pig, rat, mouse, and human
(27). human and rat hare are primarily found in the sinusoidal endothelial cells of the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen (28 –
31). additionally, mouse hare/stab-2 has been detected in
specialized tissues, such as the corneal and lens epithelium,
mesenchymal cells of heart valves, and prismatic epithelial cells
covering the renal papillae (27), and bovine hare has been
reported in the oviduct (32).
the hare proteins were first purified from rat liver (33) and
human spleen (30) and then molecularly cloned from rat and
human rna pools (29 –31). the hhare is encoded by a single
gene found on chromosome 12q23.3 spanning 180.2 kb and
containing 69 exons. the gene encodes a 2551-amino acid glycoprotein with a molecular mass of ⬃315 kda in sds-page. a
primary function of this receptor is to bind and internalize ha
for turnover, although other gags, such as the css (20, 34 –37)
(this report) are also internalized by this receptor, and advanced
glycation end products appear to be ligands as well (38, 39). the
internalized receptor traffics through the early endocytic pathway and is recycled to the cell surface (21, 29, 37, 39). a 20-min
recycling time was observed for the rat 175-kda hare
expressed in sk-hep1 cell lines, whereas a 7–9-min cycle rate
was observed with the 190-kda hhare expressed in flp-in 293
cells. these inconsistent receptor recycling times may be
dependent on intrinsic cell machinery differences.
although our group has studied the biological activity of rat
and human hare, we have focused primarily on the smaller

agaatcgagaccgaggag-3⬘) primers. the complete
sequences of the promoter and complete coding regions of
cdnas in the final clones were determined to be correct before
they were used in subsequent experiments. this full-length
hare dna sequence obtained was identical to that of ncbi
accession entry nm_017564 with the exception of silent mutations located at codons 833, 1112, 1700, 1937, 2005, and 2175
and one missense mutation, which created a d1276a mutation.
however, ala1276 was reported in an earlier entry for  xxxg2211xxx 
(accession number aj295695) and was also present in the 190
hhare clones reported by harris et al. (37). the d1276a
change does not appear to affect the biological activity of the
receptor and probably represents a polymorphism in the
human  xxxg2211xxx  gene. all protein expression experiments were
performed using this nm_017564-like cdna.
selection and verification of 315-hhare cell lines—cell
lines were produced and characterized as described by harris et
al. (37) with minor modifications. flp-in 293 cells (3 ⫻ 106;
invitrogen) were plated in a 100-mm dish 2 days prior to transfection. cells incubating in 10 ml of fresh antibiotic-free
dmem supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum were transfected by the addition of 750 ␮l of serum-free dmem containing 1.0 ␮g of pcdna5/frt/315-hare v5/his6, 9.0 ␮g of
pog44 (encoding the flp-in recombinase) and 20 ␮l of lipofectamine 2000. starting 24 –36 h post-transfection, the
medium was replaced every 2–3 days with dmem plus 8% fbs
containing 100 ␮g/ml hygromycin b. visible circular colonies
were present about 2 weeks post-transfection and isolated
using a p20 pipette with p200 tips. about 40 colonies were
isolated by gently nudging with the tip while aspirating no more
than 10 ␮l at a time. medium on the plate was changed after
picking every five colonies to reduce the chance of aspirating
free-floating cells. isolated colonies were grown in 24-well
dishes in dmem plus 8% fbs with 100 ␮g/ml hygromycin b.
after a monolayer of cells had developed from each clone, cells
were scraped in 1 ml of medium and partitioned into four portions. one portion (100 ␮l) was reseeded in fresh medium and
allowed to continue growing in the 24-well dish. the second
portion (100 ␮l) was reseeded in 100 ␮g/ml zeocin to test for
zeocin sensitivity. the third portion (400 ␮l) was pelleted and
resuspended in 50 ␮l of 4⫻ laemmli sample buffer (44) to test
for hare expression by sds-page followed by western analysis using anti-v5 antibody.
the remaining 400 ␮l of cell suspension was pelleted and
assayed for ␤-galactosidase activity. in addition to the zeocin
sensitivity test, the ␤-galactosidase test indicates whether the
hare-encoding plasmid integrated specifically and correctly
into the genomic frt site, which is the unique feature of the
flp-in cell line series. the cell pellet for this assay was resuspended in 200 ␮l of pbs containing 0.5% triton x-100 and 20
␮l of cell lysate per well of a 96-well plate was combined with 70
␮l of z-buffer and 20 ␮l of 4.0 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl-␤-d-galactoside in z-buffer. after 15–30 min at 37 °c, the absorbance
values were measured at 405– 420 nm. lysates from hek flp-in
293 and hek 293 cells were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. stable cell lines were selected for further
study only if they grew well in dmem containing 8% fbs and
100 ␮g/ml hygromycin b and showed hare expression, hygrojournal of biological chemistry

construction of the 315-hare expression vector—due to the
large size of the cdna, the 315-kda hhare coding region was
amplified from lymph node cdna pools (marathon system;
bd biosciences) using pfu ultra in two sections that overlapped
by 484 nucleotides. the 5⬘-half of the cdna was amplified
using gene-specific forward (5⬘-ggatccatgatgctacaacatttagtaattttttgtcttgg-3⬘) and reverse (5⬘ggtcattatggagaaagaagctcaggaaataggag3⬘) primers, whereas the 3⬘-half of the cdna was amplified
using gene-specific forward (5⬘-tccttaccaaacctgctcatgcggctggaacag-3⬘) and reverse (5⬘-ggatcccagtgtcctcaaggggtcattgcc-3⬘) primers. both cdna
sections were purified, mixed, denatured, and allowed to
hybridize together, and the complementary strands were filled
in using pfu ultra. using the forward primer for the 5⬘-half and
the reverse primer for the 3⬘-half, we then amplified the entire
315-hare encoding cdna (35 cycles, tm ⫽ 55 °c, extension

reagents. when necessary, the blots were stripped of bound
antibodies by incubating the membranes in 100 mm 2- xxxd26xxx , 2% sds, 62.5 mm tris-hcl, ph 6.7, at 55 °c for 30
min. after several washes in tbst, the blots were reprobed
with anti-v5 mab. densitometry was performed using an
fluor-chem 8000 gel visualization and analysis system (alpha
innotech corp., san leandro, ca).
for 125i-ha ligand blots (49), the nitrocellulose membrane
was incubated with tbst for at least 2 h at 4 °c followed by an
incubation with 1 ␮g/ml 125i-ha in pbs containing 150 mm
nacl, 10 mm hepes, ph 7.4, 5 mm edta, with or without 100
␮g/ml unlabeled ha as competitor to assess nonspecific binding. following a 2-h binding incubation at 4 °c, the membrane
was washed with excess tbst at least five times over 30 min
and dried at room temperature. bound 125i-ha was detected by
autoradiography using eastman kodak co. ms film exposed at
⫺80 °c for 24 – 48 h.
the method for biotin-gag ligand blots was a modification
of the above ha ligand blot procedure in which the membrane
with blotted proteins was incubated with a specific amount of
biotin-gag, washed, and detected with 125i-streptavidin. biotin-gags were made according to the protocol of yu and toole
(50), and a biotin quantification kit (vector laboratories, burlingame, ca) was used to determine the number of biotins/
gag chain. the molar mass and concentration of each gag
were determined by size exclusion multiangle laser light scattering before and after the biotinylation reactions to ensure the
addition of 1–2 biotins per gag chain, without gag degradation, and to calculate the final yield of each biotin-gag.
endoglycosidase f treatment and immunoprecipitation—
hare was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates or media containing 0.5% nonidet p-40 and protease inhibitors (1 ␮g/ml
leupeptin, 1 ␮g/ml pepstatin a, 30 ␮g/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride) using anti-rat hare mabs 30, 154, and 159 attached
to cnbr-activated sepharose (0.3 mg/ml each mab) and
allowed to rotate overnight at 4 °c. if the sample was to go
straight to western analysis, the resin was washed twice with
pbs and eluted with an equal volume of 4⫻ laemmli buffer and
centrifuged briefly to pellet the resin. if the sample was to be
treated with endoglycosidase f, the centrifuged resin was
washed twice with pbs and incubated with an equal volume of
pbs containing 1% sds to disrupt antibody-hare binding.
the supernatant recovered after centrifugation was adjusted to
1% nonidet p-40 and incubated with 1.0 unit of n-glycosidase f
(roche applied science) overnight at 37 °c. the sample was
then mixed with 0.25 volumes of 4⫻ laemmli buffer, separated
by 5% sds-page, and analyzed by western blot assays.
fluorescence microscopy—cells were grown on 18-mm glass
coverslips in complete medium for at least 2 days prior to fixation. cells were washed twice with pbs and fixed in pbs containing 1% formaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature, followed
by two rinses in pbs. nonspecific antibody interactions were
blocked with pbs containing 0.25% bsa for 30 min. alternatively, cells were permeabilized (45) with 0.05% saponin for 30
min at room temperature after the blocking procedure. cells
were incubated with both primary and secondary antibodies in
pbs containing 0.25% bsa for 1 h and washed between incubations. glass coverslips were mounted onto glass slides immedivolume 282 • number 5 • february 2, 2007

endocytosis and degradation of 125i-ha—the c-terminal
epitope tags do not interfere with ha binding, internalization,
or trafficking mediated by the 190-kda hare (37). stably
transfected cell lines expressing the 315-hare were plated in
12-well dishes and allowed to grow in dmem with 8% fetal calf
serum supplemented with 100 ␮g/ml hygromycin b at least 2
days prior to an experiment. cells were washed with hbss and
incubated for 60 min with fresh medium containing 0.075%
bsa to allow hare-mediated internalization of any serum
gags that might be bound to the cell surface. the same
dmem-bsa medium containing 1–2 ␮g/ml 125i-ha was then
incubated with cells with or without the noted gag as a competitor. endocytosis or binding only of 125i-ha was measured
by incubating cells at 37 or 4 °c, respectively. to determine ha
binding by the total cell receptor population, cells on ice were
permeabilized with 0.055% (w/v) digitonin (using a 25% stock
solution) dissolved in anhydrous me2so (45). at the indicated
times, cells were washed three times with ice-cold hbss and
lysed in 0.3 n naoh, and radioactivity and protein content (46)
were determined.
degradation of 125i-ha was measured by a cetylpyridinium
chloride precipitation assay, as reported previously (47). briefly,
50 ␮l of sample medium was mixed with 0.25 ml of a 1.0 mg/ml
solution of ha (as a carrier) in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes.
alternatively, 100-␮l samples of cell lysates in 0.3 n naoh were
mixed with 47 ␮l of 0.6 n hcl, 28 ␮l of distilled water, and 125
␮l of 2.0 mg/ml carrier ha solution. after mixing at room temperature, 300 ␮l of 6% (w/v) cetylpyridinium chloride in distilled water was added to each tube and vortexed. the samples
were allowed to precipitate for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at 8600 ⫻ g for 5 min in an eppendorf 5417 using a swinging bucket rotor.  xxxd3426xxx -␮l sample of the supernatant was taken
for radioactivity determination, and the remaining supernatant
was removed by aspiration. the bottoms of the tubes containing the pellet were cut off and placed in 12 ⫻ 75-mm plastic
tubes for radioactivity determination using a packard cobra ii
␥ counter. degradation was calculated as the time-dependent
increase of nonprecipitable radioactivity. at least 80% of the
total radioactivity was precipitable at the beginning of each
experiment.
western and ligand blot assays—cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were mixed with 4⫻ laemmli sample buffer (44)
without reducing agent and analyzed by sds-page using a 5%
gel. protein electrotransfers to nitrocellulose were performed

cell surface biotinylation and immunoprecipitation—four
different 315-hare clones (17.5, 29, 30, and 36) were grown to
confluence in t-25 tissue culture flasks. after a 60-min incubation in serum-free medium, the cells were washed twice with
cold pbs and incubated in the presence or absence of 0.05%
digitonin (45) in pbs for 10 min at 4 °c. the cells were then
washed twice with cold pbs and treated with 2 mm sulfo-nhsss-biotin in pbs for 30 min at 4 °c. the biotinylation reaction
was terminated by washing and then incubating the cells with
100 mm glycine, ph 8.0, in pbs for 20 min at 4 °c to quench
unreacted sulfo-nhs-ss-biotin. washed cells were then lysed
in 0.5% nonidet p-40 pbs containing 200 ␮m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 ␮g/ml pepstatin, and 1.0 ␮g/ml leupeptin for
1 h at 4 °c, and cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at
14,000 ⫻ g for 10 min at 4 °c. the resulting supernatant was
used for immunoprecipitation experiments. anti-rat hare
mab-159 (2 ␮g/ml) was added to 1.0 ml of supernatant, which
was incubated with rotation for 2 h at 4 °c, and immune complexes were then collected with 20 ␮l of 250 ␮g/ml protein
a/g-plus-agarose overnight at 4 °c. the resin was washed
three times with cold pbs, and the pellet was resuspended in 30
␮l of 2⫻ laemmli sample buffer without reducing agent, incubated for 3 min at 90 °c, and subjected to sds-page and western analysis.

results
two isoforms of hare are expressed from a single
315-hare cdna—results from previous studies showed that
hare is a cell surface receptor that clears ha, cs, and
advanced glycation end products from the circulatory and lymphatic systems. studies of hare or stabilin/ xxxg2211xxx  in other
laboratories focused only on the large isoform, disregarding the
possibility of a smaller isoform (i.e. the 190-kda hare). however, we have shown that the smaller isoform of the recombinant rat (29) or human hare (37) is a recycling endocytic
receptor specific for ha and multiple cs types that operates via
the coated pit endocytosis pathway. to study the specificity and
function of the large human hare, we amplified and cloned
the open reading frame from pooled lymph node cdna and
inserted the full-size 315-hare cdna into the expression vector pcdna5/frt/v5-his-topo. except for the absence of the
secretion signal, this is the same vector that we used previously
to express and characterize the independent function of the
190-hare.
the full-length 315-kda hare type i membrane protein
contains an extracellular domain with four cysteine-rich fasciclin/ xxxg681xxx -like domains of unknown function, an extracellular link domain, a cytoplasmic domain, and
a single membrane domain (fig. 1a). the 190-hare is identical to the c-terminal 1417 amino acids of the full-length hare
(fig. 1a), which we previously suggested arises by proteolytic
cleavage (29, 37).
the six cell lines used in this study each contain a single
315-hare cdna integrated at the single correct recombinasespecified site in flp-in 293 cells, as confirmed by their resistance to hygromycin b, lack of ␤-galactosidase activity, and sensitivity to zeocin. the amount of 315-hare expression in all six
cell lines was only ⬃12% of that observed for recombinant 190journal of biological chemistry

side-mounted camera operated by act-1 software version 2.6.3.
secreted receptor constructs—cdna constructs for the
secreted ectodomains of both the 315- and 190-hare were
produced by deleting the transmembrane and cytoplasmic
domains, while retaining the v5 and his6 tags. a single primer,
5⬘-gtgaccttgacccacactggatccgaaggtaagcctatc-3⬘, was used in individual mutagenic reactions with the
wild type hare cdnas (315-hare in pcdna5/frt/v5/his,
190-hare in psectag/frt/v5/his) in an ericomp thermocycler for 18 cycles (94 °c for 30 s, 63 °c for 30 s, 71 °c for 1
min/plasmid kb) using pfu ultra. after the reaction, the plasmid was  xxxd102xxx precipitated and resuspended in 17 ␮l of h2o,
2 ␮l of neb4 buffer, and 2.5 units of dpni to cut the template
plasmid while retaining the intact mutant plasmid. after an
overnight incubation at 37 °c, the digest mix was heated to
95 °c for 10 min, cooled, and immediately transformed into
top10 supercompetent e. coli cells. bacterial cells containing
the plasmid of choice were screened by a miniprep procedure, and pcr and dna sequencing confirmed the mutation. plasmids containing the desired mutation were used to
make stable cell lines, which were created and evaluated as
described above.
soluble hare purification—s190-hare or s315-hare was
purified from pooled cell growth media (dmem containing 8%
fbs and 100 ␮g/ml hygromycin b) via the his6 tag. to remove
particulate matter, conditioned medium (incubated with cells
for at least 2 days) was centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 4 min. clarified medium was supplemented with the following to the indicated final concentrations: 10% glycerol, 250 mm nacl, 10 mm
imidazole. a 1% volume of 50% slurry of ni2⫹-charged sepharose 6 fast flow resin (amersham biosciences) was added, and
the mixture was incubated overnight at room temperature with
gentle rotation. the resin was captured in a 25-ml column,
washed with 10 column volumes of pbs containing 10 mm
imidazole, and then eluted with 4 column volumes of pbs containing 400 mm imidazole. the partially purified hare was
concentrated using a 30-kda molecular mass cut-off concentrator and separated by sds-page on a 5% gel. the gel was
stained with a 4% cucl2 solution to visualize protein bands, and
the hare band was cut out of the gel with a clean razor blade,
minced, and electroeluted overnight in dialysis tubing (35 v,
4 °c) in 185 mm glycine, 25 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.5, 0.07% sds.
the final purified hare preparation was concentrated to 0.1–
1.0 mg/ml as above, washed twice with pbs, and stored at
⫺20 °c until use in subsequent assays.
elisas—all steps were carried out at 37 °c. a set amount of
hare protein in coating buffer (200 ␮l) was incubated in each
well of a polysorb strip for 2 h. the surface of the well was then
blocked with tbst supplemented with 2% bsa and 0.1%
tween 20 for 1.5 h. after washing, increasing concentrations of
biotin-ha were incubated for 2 h, washed six times with tbst
(without protein), incubated for 1 h with streptavidin-alkaline
phosphatase, washed six times in tbst, and finally incubated
with  xxxd2822xxx . the a405 of the strips were
determined each hour for 3 h.

figure 1. schematic of the two hare isoforms and their expression in
stable cell lines. a, the scheme illustrates the domain organization of the
315- and 190-kda hare proteins. the four cys-rich domains are 37–39% identical (⬃50% similar) to each other. each receptor isoform contains one link
domain, one transmembrane region, and one cytoplasmic domain. the arrow
indicates the n terminus of the 190-kda hare (ser1136), which may be the site
of cleavage to create this isoform. b, in order to assess the cellular ratios of
315- to 190-hare isoforms, cells were scraped from t-25 flasks, washed, and
resuspended in pbs with 0.5% nonidet p-40 and protease inhibitors. the cell
lysates were incubated with rotation at 4 °c for 1 h and centrifuged to remove
cell debris, and total protein content of each sample was quantified using the
bradford assay (46). lysate protein (20 ␮g) was analyzed by sds-page and
western blots. the 315-hare (filled arrow) and 190-hare (open arrow) were
detected by chemiluminescence using polyclonal anti-v5 antibody. c, the
blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-actin antibody to allow samples to
be normalized to cellular protein content.

hare expressed alone in the same cells using the same promoter and growth conditions (37). nonetheless, all six cell lines
mediated specific ha endocytosis over 4 h that was well above
the background level of the parental flp-in 293 cells or cells
transfected with vector alone (not shown).
unexpectedly, all cell lines expressing the single cdna
encoding full-length 315-kda hare produced two individual
hare proteins with molecular masses of ⬃315 and 190 kda as
detected in western blots using an antibody against the c-terminal v5 epitope (fig. 1b). the native spleen and recombinant
190-hares migrated identically in 5% sds-page with the
190-kda species in these 315-hare cell lines (not shown). the
hare expression patterns among all the cell lines were virtually identical, and the majority of the recombinant protein
migrated at ⬃315 kda with a lesser amount migrating at 190
kda (fig. 1b). all cell lines produced approximately the same
amount of 315-kda receptor relative to cellular actin (1.9 ⫾ 0.2
for the six samples in fig. 1, b and c) and produced similar
ratios of the 315-kda to 190-kda hare (2.7 ⫾ 0.4 for the
experiment in fig. 1b). the 315/190-hare ratio was typically
3– 4:1 in multiple western analyses using detection by either
chemiluminescence or alkaline phosphatase.

recombinant hare appears to be folded and glycosylated
correctly and specifically binds ha—although we do not
know why expression of the recombinant full-length hare
was lower than the independently expressed 190-hare, we
suspect that overexpression of such a large protein containing
202 cysteines might overwhelm the endoplasmic reticulum systems that facilitate protein folding and disulfide bond formation. the two expressed receptors appear to be folded correctly
based on their reactivity with three anti-rat mabs that crossreact with human hare (fig. 2) and the specific ha binding
activity of each recombinant protein in ligand blot and cell culture assays. mabs 30, 154, and 159 detected both the larger and
smaller hare proteins in whole cell lysates of 315-haretransfected cells (fig. 2, nr). reduction of the proteins with
dithiothreitol resulted in detection by only mab 159 (fig. 2, r),
confirming that mabs 30 and 154 recognize conformational
(e.g. sulfhydryl-dependent) epitopes, perhaps within the cysrich  xxxg681xxx -like domains that are conserved
between rat and human hare proteins. using sds-page to
resolve the two hare species, we verified that both receptors
specifically bind 125i-ha in a ligand blot assay (fig. 3a). the
above results demonstrate that the 190-kda protein produced
by 315-hare cell lines is a hare isoform and not an artifact of
the assays performed. in addition, stable cell lines containing
the empty vector alone do not show mab- or ha-binding
bands at these mr positions (not shown).
reduction by dithiothreitol, followed by alkylation to block
refolding via disulfide bond formation, dramatically shifted the
migration of the 190-hare species to apparently larger mass
(fig. 3b). the decreased migration of the reduced 315-hare
through 5% sds-page was less apparent, since migratory
shifts in a protein of this size are more difficult to demonstrate.
also, the rod-like geometry of the nonreduced and reduced
full-length receptor may contribute to their similar migration

figure 2. both recombinant human 315- and 190-kda hare isoforms
cross-react with rat anti-hare mabs. whole cell lysates were subjected to
reducing (r) or nonreducing (nr) conditions, separated by 5% sds-page, and
electrotransferred to nitrocellulose as described under “experimental procedures.” nitrocellulose was cut into strips and blocked with tbst/bsa, and
each strip was incubated with 1 ␮g/ml mouse igg or one of the eight indicated mabs raised against the rat 175-kda hare (28, 33). the 315-kda hare
(filled arrows) and the 190-kda hare (open arrows) proteins were recognized
by mabs 30, 154, and 159 in the nonreduced samples, whereas both receptors reacted with only mab 159 when reduced. the anti-v5 lane (far right) was
a positive control for mab detection.

patterns (51). we conclude from western blot and silver stain
(not shown) analyses of reduced and nonreduced samples that
the recombinant human 315-hare is a single polypeptide and
not composed of multiple subunits linked together by disulfide
bonds.
when the full-length hhare was treated with endoglycosidase f to remove n-linked oligosaccharides, a more pronounced migratory shift was observed (fig. 3c), which was similar to that observed previously for the recombinant 190-hare
and the native rat and human receptor isoforms. endoglycosidase f treatment did not affect 125i-ha binding, revealing that
n-linked glycans are not required for ha binding.
due to the low amount of recombinant 190-kda hare in the
315-hare stable cell lines, we were not able to obtain enough
purified 190-hare for n-terminal amino acid sequencing.

figure 3. the nonreduced 315- and 190-kda hare proteins specifically
bind ha. whole cell lysates from cells stably expressing recombinant 315kda hare were subjected to either reduction and then alkylation or nonreducing conditions, followed by 5% sds-page and electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membranes. a, a ligand blot (lb) assay was first performed by
incubating the nitrocellulose with 1 ␮g/ml 125i-ha either alone or mixed with
a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ha, washing, and autoradiography as
described under “experimental procedures.” b, following the ligand blot, the
nitrocellulose membrane was rehydrated in tbst/bsa, and western blot (wb)
analysis was performed using anti-v5 antibody to identify hhare. c, the 315hare protein was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with mab 30, eluted
from the resin with 0.1% sds, and digested overnight with endoglycosidase
f. after electrophoresis and electrotransfer to nitrocellulose, the blot was subjected to the 125i-ha ligand blot assay followed by western blot analysis with
anti-v5 antibody.

however, we purified the 190-hare from a human spleen
sample and obtained the sequence nh2-llpnllmrl. except
for the first amino acid, this sequence is identical to the presumed sequence for the 190-hare starting at ser1136 of the
full-length protein. the first leu in our sample may be a
sequencing error or a real mutation (polymorphism) in the
genome of the individual spleen donor.
cells expressing hare endocytose and degrade 125i-ha—recombinant hare encoded by the full-length cdna is biologically active, since cells expressing the protein can endocytose
ha. four different cell lines (17.5, 29, 30, and 36) were allowed
to endocytose 125i-ha with and without competing nonlabeled
ha over a 26-h period (fig. 4a). unlike the parent flp-in 293
cells or cells transfected with vector alone, 315-hare cells specifically internalized ha. ha uptake increased and reached a
steady state accumulation after about 24 h. in addition to internalization, the flp-in 293 cells were able to deliver ha to lysosomes, where it was degraded (fig. 4b), presumably by the
combined actions of endogenous lysosomal hyaluronidases,
␤-n-acetylglucosaminidase, and ␤-glucuronidase. unlike the
previously described 190-hare cell lines, the 315-hare clones
varied more in their ha endocytic rates and degradation.
we and others showed previously that internalization of
hare in primary cell cultures or stable cell lines occurs via a
clathrin-coated pit pathway (21, 29, 35, 39). to confirm that the
recombinant 315-kda hare mediates endocytosis via coated
pits, we incubated 315-hare clone 30 cells with 125i-ha for 4 h
in medium containing increasing amounts of sucrose (fig. 4c).
under hyperosmotic conditions (e.g. ⱖ0.4 m sucrose), receptor-mediated endocytosis decreased by ⬎90%, indicating
that ha uptake depends on clathrin assembly into coated
pits (52–54).
the s315- and s190-hare ectodomains bind 125i-ha—the
secreted s315-hare ectodomain was purified from cell culture
medium via either the his6 tail using nickel-chelate affinity
chromatography or anti-v5 immunopurification. partially
purified s315-hare appeared to be folded correctly, since it
bound ha in the ligand blot assay (fig. 5a), whereas reduction
nullified ha binding, and deglycosylation did not affect ha
binding, which were the same results seen with the membranebound 315-hare. expression and glycosylation of the s190 and
s315-hare ectodomains in cell culture were virtually identical.
in addition, the recognition of the soluble receptors by mabs 30
and 154 was the same as the membrane receptors in western
blot or immunoprecipitation assays (not shown). both hare
ectodomains also bound comparable amounts of 125i-ha in the
ligand blot assay (fig. 5b).
since the s315-hare has ha binding capability comparable
with the wild type receptor, we used an elisa-like assay to
estimate the ha binding affinity. purified s315-hare or s190hare was plated on polysorb strips, nonspecific binding sites
were blocked with bsa, and the strips were incubated with
increasing amounts of biotin-ha. bound biotin-ha was
detected with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase. the binding
of biotin-ha to either hare ectodomain was almost identical
(when normalized to pmol of protein). the data were fit as
second order binding curves (fig. 6) with a calculated kd value
of 9.9 ⫾ 1.2 nm (p ⬍ 0.0001) for the s315-hare and 20.7 ⫾ 6.4

clone 17.5 (⽧) were plated in 24-well plates and grown to confluence. a, after a
60-min incubation in serum-free medium, the cells were washed with 1 ml of
hbss and allowed to endocytose 1.5 ␮g/ml 125i-ha in dmem supplemented
with 0.05% bsa, with or without 150 ␮g/ml unlabeled ha. at the noted times,
medium was aspirated, and the well was washed three times with 1 ml of

protein were determined. the values shown are the average of duplicates
(typically within 10%) for specific cell-associated cpm/␮g of protein: total
uptake (no excess ha) minus the nonspecific uptake (with excess unlabeled
ha). specific uptake and degradation values, which varied depending on the
cell line and time point, were 77– 87 and 62– 87%, respectively. b, cell-associated degradation of 125i-ha was determined at the noted times by a cetylpyridinium chloride precipitation assay, as described under “experimental procedures,” using a portion of the neutralized cell lysate from the samples in a.
degradation values are the average of duplicates. c, 315-hare cells mediate

uptake) or without (to assess total uptake) a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ha
and increasing concentrations of sucrose, as indicated. a stock 1.2 m sucrose
solution was made in dmem-bsa and diluted in dmem-bsa to give the final
concentrations indicated. prior to the experiment, cells were incubated at

close to the dissociation constant value of 7 nm determined
for ha-receptor complexes in cells expressing recombinant
190-hare (37).
hare binds to a subset of gags in addition to ha—we
previously reported that other gags compete with ha for
binding to the 190-hare. since it is not known how hare
binds to its multiple ligands or what domains within the protein
interact with each ligand, the gag-binding properties of the
larger 315-kda hare may be different from those of the
smaller hare. we therefore tested the gag-binding and
internalization properties of cells expressing the 315-hare to
discern whether they were different for this larger ha-binding
receptor. this was tested in endocytosis assays in which 190hare (clone 14) and 315-hare (clone 30) stable cell lines
were allowed to endocytose 125i-ha in the presence of an
excess of different competing gags (fig. 7a). these results
showed that the gag-binding profiles are very similar between
cells independently expressing the 190-hare and cells
expressing the 315-hare (and smaller amounts of 190-hare).
the ability of all of the cs types to compete for ha uptake
indicates that these gags bind at or near the ha binding site(s)
in either hare ectodomain.

4 h the cells were washed, and proteincontent, radioactivity, and specific ha
uptake were determined as described under “experimental procedures.” specific 125i-ha endocytosis without sucrose was 70%. specific cpm/␮g of protein values for endocytosis are means ⫾ s.d. (n ⫽ 3).

and reduced with dithiothreitol or deglycosylated with endoglycosidase f
treatment as described under “experimental procedures.” the deglycosylated receptor retains ha binding activity as seen in the ligand blot (lb) assay,
in contrast to the reduced receptor, which does not bind 125i-ha. following
the ligand blot, the same membrane was subjected to western blot (wb)
analysis using anti-v5 antibody. b, the s190-hare and s315-hare demonstrate comparable 125i-ha-binding activities in the ligand blot assay. a ligand

s315-hare protein after sds-page and electrotransfer.

characterization of the human 315-kda hare

thus far, all of our binding experiments have used 125i-ha
and competing nonlabeled gags in live cell assays to obtain
evidence that the other gags bind to hare. since negative
results in these indirect assays do not rule out the presence of
independent binding sites for the other gags, we developed
direct binding assays to determine whether other gags can
bind hare. to test this possibility, we prepared a panel of eight
biotin-gags (i.e. chondroitin, cs-a, cs-b, cs-c, cs-d, cs-e,
ha, and hs) and assessed the gag binding to hare using a
ligand blot procedure similar to that described above for
125
i-ha (fig. 7b). in this experiment, the s315-hare was purified by ni2⫹-chelate chromatography followed by 5% sdspage, blotted to nitrocellulose, and incubated with biotingag with or without an excess of the same nonbiotinylated
gag to determine nonspecific binding. binding of the biotin-gag was then detected using 125i-streptavidin and autoradiography. the results showed specific binding of the s315hare with cs-c, cs-d, cs-e, and ha, suggesting that hare
is a clearance receptor for multiple gags (fig. 7b). biotin-hs
did not bind to the s315-hare. we know from other experiments (and longer exposure times of this experiment) that
cs-b and chondroitin also bind to hare but with a lower affinity that has yet to be measured (not shown).
a majority of hare resides on intracellular vesicles—since
endocytic recycling receptors are found on the cell surface and
in multiple early endosomal compartments along their intracellular itinerary, we wanted to determine the distribution of
hare between surface and intracellular compartments. the

30 and 190-hare clone 41 cells were plated in 12-well plates and grown to
confluence. after a 1-h incubation in serum-free medium, the cells were
washed with 2 ml of hbss and allowed to endocytose 1.5 ␮g/ml 125i-ha for
4 h at 37 °c in dmem supplemented with 0.05% bsa with or without 30
␮g/ml of the noted gag. the medium was aspirated, the well was washed
three times with 2 ml of hbss, and the cells were lysed in 1 ml of 0.3 n
naoh. radioactivity and protein per sample were determined. the data
are expressed as a percentage of the radioactivity in cells with no other
gag addition. the mean ⫾ s.d. (n ⫽ 6) of duplicates from three separate
experiments is shown. b, direct binding of a gag was assessed by a ligand
blot assay in which the indicated biotin-gag was incubated alone or with
a 4-fold excess of unlabeled gag. after washing the membrane strips
containing the protein-gag complex, the biotin-gag remaining was
detected by autoradiography after incubation with 2.5 ␮g/ml 125i-streptavidin. cs-c, cs-d, cs-e, and ha bound with hare with the highest affinity,
whereas cs-b and chondroitin (chon) bound with a low affinity. no binding was detected with cs-a or hs. the negative control (far right lane, top)
containing the same amount of s315-hare was not treated with any biotin-gag but was treated with 125i-streptavidin.

190-hare, for example, is distributed roughly equally, with
⬃50% on the cell surface (37). this is similar to the rat small
hare isoform stably expressed in sk-hep1 cells, which colocalized with early endocytic markers, such as clathrin, but not
later endosomes or lysosomes (29). an initial assessment of
receptor localization was performed using fluorescence
microscopy in which cells were either permeabilized with
0.05% saponin (fig. 8a) or intact (fig. 8b), and the fixed cells
were probed with mab-30 against the 315- and 190-hare proteins. the permeabilized cells contained numerous bright
intracellular vesicles with a faint ring of staining representing
the cell surface. in contrast, nonpermeabilized cells showed
only distinct perimeter fluorescence, indicating surface expression (fig. 8b). the fluorescence output from a field of permeabilized cells was ⬃4 –5 times greater than a field of nonpermeabilized cells, confirming that most hare is intracellular.
next, we used a biotin-labeling technique to determine the
ratio of internal to surface receptor, because differences in this

ratio could explain the clonal differences in endocytosis of ha
among cell lines. cells from four different 315-hare cell lines
were incubated with biotinylation reagent on ice to prevent
constitutive endocytosis and without (nonpermeabilized) or
with (permeabilized) 0.05% digitonin to allow perfusion of the
biotinylation reagent to the cell interior. total hare was then
immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and western analysis
was performed to compare the amount of biotinylated hare
(using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase) and total hare
(using anti-v5 antibody). the results demonstrated that a
majority of the 190-hare and 315-hare in all four clones
resides on the interior of the cell. cells not treated with digitonin had only their cell surface receptors biotinylated, and the
ratio of those receptors compared with the total receptor content (i.e. anti-v5 staining) was low (fig. 9, a–d, light and dark
gray bars). in contrast, most of the hare in permeabilized cells
was biotinylated, and the ratio of biotin-hare to v5 staining
was quite high, indicating a much greater receptor content
inside cells relative to the surface (fig. 9, a–d, open and solid
bars). based on these biotin-labeling and the preceding fluorescence experiments, we estimate that only about 5–10% of the
total cellular hare, for either isoform, is at the cell surface.

discussion
hare, which has also been named  xxxg2211xxx ,  xxxg2211xxx , and
fex-2 by other laboratories, is the primary receptor for the
clearance of ha and probably cs from the circulatory and lymphatic systems. hare binds not only ha but also other gags,
particularly the cs types, with high specificity. ha, free cs
chains, and probably cs proteoglycan fragments, all of which
continuously flow from tissue ecms, first enter the lymphatic
system and encounter the endocytic, recycling hare in the
lymph nodes, where most of these ecm components are
degraded. this normal gag turnover process might be accel-

hare isoforms in 315-hare cell lines. 315-hare cell lines 17.5 (a), 29 (b), 30
(c), and 36 (d) were plated in tissue culture flasks and grown to confluence.
cell surface or total cellular receptors were biotinylated using 2 mm sulfonhs-ss-biotin for 10 min at 4 °c, respectively, in the absence (not permeabilized) or presence (permeabilized) of 0.05% digitonin (45). cells were solubilized with 0.5% nonidet p-40 plus protease inhibitors and then processed for
immunoprecipitation with mab 159 and analysis by sds-page as described
under “experimental procedures.” after electrophoresis, the proteins were
electrotransferred to nitrocellulose and probed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, and the same blots were then stripped and reprobed with anti-v5 antibody. the blots were scanned, and the digital data
were expressed as the average (n ⫽ 4) ratio of streptavidin/v5 detection

and permeabilized (white bar)) and 315-kda hare (unpermeabilized (dark

erated in wound healing, injury, growth, and other disease
states, including some cancers. most of the high molecular
mass (⬎106-da) ha and, presumably, the other cs-type gags
are cleared in the lymph nodes, and the remaining gags that
enter the blood stream are cleared by liver sinusoidal endothelium-associated hare. the activity of this gag clearance system was first observed in experiments using animal models to
study ha catabolism (17, 18, 34, 55). in addition to its scavenger
activity, hare located in the spleen, which is not a clearance
organ, may play an important yet unknown role in immune
system function.
in this report, we note that human hare is expressed as two
isoforms that are encoded from the same cdna (i.e. an mrna
not subject to alternate splicing). the 190- and 315-kda isoforms are recognized by the same subset of anti-rat hare
mabs, and both soluble ectodomains bind ha to the same
extent and with almost the same affinity. both hare isoforms
also recognize multiple cs types as well as ha. we know that
cells expressing only the 190-kda isoform can function in the
absence of the 315-kda isoform to bind and internalize ha and
other gags (37). when both the 315- and 190-kda hare are
present in the same cells within a tissue, we do not yet know
whether they can function as independent receptors, as heterooligomeric complexes, or as both.

mutagenesis of a possible adjacent furin-like site (kk1131 to
aa1131) did not eliminate the proteolytic processing in 293
cells. similarly, studies with a variety of commonly used protease inhibitors (e.g.  xxxg555xxx ,  xxxd2329xxx , edta, e-64, aprotinin) failed to identify a potential protease. we are currently
investigating how proteolytic cleavage of hare occurs, what
protease is involved, or whether hare itself might be
autocatalytic.
observance of the smaller hare isoform is not unique to our
laboratory. a report on murine  xxxg2211xxx  and human stabilin-1
provided evidence that human  xxxg2211xxx /hare is processed to
generate the smaller isoform, although the authors did not discuss its presence or consider it relevant (39). the highly similar
protein stabilin-1 also has a smaller isoform of about 140 kda
(56).3 potentially, the smaller isoforms of both stabilin-1 and
hare may have different ligand-binding profiles or a different
subset of interacting effector molecules than their full-length
counterparts.
unlike the large native rat liver hare isoform, which contains two large disulfide-bonded subunits of 220 and 250 kda
(33), the recombinant 315-kda human hare is a single
polypeptide. by western analysis, the 315-kda protein band
did not decrease in size after reduction with dithiothreitol, and
multiple bands were not detected. reduction of immunoaffinity-purified 315-hare produced a single band detected by silver staining. in previous studies with purified 315-hare from
human spleen, we found that this isoform contained two large
disulfide-bonded subunits. although it is possible that flp-in
293 cells do not have the capability of sinusoidal endothelial
cells to post-translationally modify hare in the same fashion,
in more recent experiments with fresher spleen tissue, we did
not find multiple subunits in the large hare isoform. it thus
appears likely that variable extraction or storage conditions
influence nonspecific cleavage of the large protein isolated from
tissues. therefore, we presently believe that each human hare
isoform is composed of only one type of polypeptide subunit.
these results do not exclude the possible presence of nondisulfide-bonded hare homo-oligomers or hetero-oligomers, as
noted above.
the expression level of the recombinant 190-hare in earlier
studies (37) was 8 –10-fold higher than hare expression in any
of the 315-kda hare cell lines. since the same cytomegalovirus promoter drives expression of either hare isoform, we
initially thought there might be a difference in translation efficiency related to the use of two different signal sequences. to
test this, we put the 315-hare-encoding cdna, without the
native signal sequence, into the psectag vector containing the
ig-␬ chain signal sequence. this is the same signal sequence
used to express the 190-hare cdna (37). the change in signal
sequences did not make any difference in 315-hare expression (not shown), indicating that lower expression is probably a
protein folding or trafficking issue rather than a difference in
transcription or translation.
the 315-hare has 202 cys residues, compared with 104 for
the 190-hare, and may simply be much more difficult to fold

forms expressed in stable cell cultures, either together or the
190-hare alone, it seems that the biological activities of these
two receptors are remarkably similar. both hare isoforms
contain the same link domain and the two c-terminal cysrich domains (fig. 1a). the larger isoform has the additional
two n-terminal cys-rich domains. these four domains are
highly conserved, especially their cys alignments, which indicates that their disulfide bond pattern and overall folding are
essentially identical. although the function of these cys-rich
domains is not known, it is tempting to speculate that they are
involved in gag binding, perhaps with multiple similar binding sites in each domain. studies are in progress to test this
possibility. both hare isoforms also contain the same cytoplasmic domain for potential intracellular signaling (e.g. endocytic trafficking).
thus far, it has not been possible to study the activity of the
membrane-bound 315-hare independently of the 190-kda
receptor, since proteolytic cleavage appears to be the normal
processing pathway for the full-length protein in 293 and other
cells (e.g. cho), as it appears to be in vivo. despite the consequent complication of not being able to characterize the gag
binding and endocytic ability of the 315-kda hare by itself in
live cells, we were able to demonstrate that the soluble ectodomain of the 315-hare binds directly to cs-c, cs-d, and cs-e
in addition to ha. we also detected a lower level of s315-hare
binding to cs-b and chondroitin, but the sensitivity of the
ligand blot assay may not be sufficient to quantify these interactions. we are currently developing alternative assays to
address this issue.
the only inconsistency we have observed in the gag-binding activity of hare occurred with cs-a. in live cell assays,
cs-a competes very effectively with labeled ha (20, 23, 29, 36,
37); however, we could not detect a cs-a-hare interaction by
ligand blot assays, and we obtained similar sporadic binding
results in elisa-like assays (not shown). the binding activity of
cs-a may be sensitive to the conditions of our in vitro assays, or
the affinity may be too low to retain a good signal with the
washing protocol in these assays. we are currently working to
optimize the level of detection with these assays as well as testing whether the 190-hare and 315-hare have different gag
binding profiles due to the additional protein domains of the
larger isoform.
expression of the full-length 315-hare cdna produces two
protein products of different size but similar function. the
processing of the 315-hare appears to be a tightly regulated
process, since the ratio of 315- to 190-hare was consistently
⬃3– 4:1 in multiple experiments with the six cell lines used
here. earlier results also demonstrated a consistent ratio of the
two isoforms in rat liver or human spleen and the possibility
that isoform ratios might differ between tissues (30, 33). from
our protein sequencing data, the 190-hare purified from
human spleen begins at ser1136. this n-terminal region does
not contain a consensus sequence or motif for known proteases, and the biological implications of such an activity are
unknown at this time. a goal for future studies is to prevent
processing of the 315-hare, by use of inhibitors or mutagenesis, in order to study the cellular function of this larger isoform
in the absence of the 190-kda hare. in ongoing studies,

and align correctly for disulfide bond formation. thus, a higher
fraction of the 315-hare protein may be misfolded and
degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum, compared with the
190-hare. the lower expression of 315-hare may also
account for the greater variability in ha endocytic activity
among the six cell lines expressing the 315-hare. this variability may seem surprising given the single uniform insertion
site of the hare cdna in flp-in 293 cells. however, the background genotype will not be identical for any cloned cell lines,
due to random mutations in other genes. endocytosis and degradation rates may be sensitive to changes in hundreds of different proteins involved in coated pit cycling, receptor recycling, endosomal, lysosomal, and other intracellular trafficking
pathways. since the signal (i.e. hare-mediated ha uptake) is
lower, such mutations may have more noticeable inhibitory
effects.
the human hare link domain is 50% identical (65% similar) to the gallus gallus (chicken)  xxxg2297xxx  link domain and
26% identical (44% similar) to the human cd44 link domain.
the link domain in hare is a primary candidate for an habinding domain, although we do not yet know if the epidermal
growth factor-like cys-rich domains facilitate binding to ha or
to some of the other cs types. the link domains from hare,
cd44, and  xxxg2297xxx  contain four highly conserved cysteines,
which may be required for proper folding to facilitate ha binding. based on structural studies and computer modeling, most
of the link amino acids involved with ha binding are tyr (57).
since the results in figs. 5b and 6 show that the ha-binding
ability of the s190- and s315-hare are essentially the same, the
common link domain could be responsible for ha binding.
preliminary results show that ha endocytosis by cells stably
expressing a 190-hare link-deletion variant is inhibited
greatly compared with wild type, but is not eliminated. currently, we are investigating whether the hare link domain
binds to ha or cs and if potentially key amino acids identified
by nmr comparison studies of link modules are involved.
