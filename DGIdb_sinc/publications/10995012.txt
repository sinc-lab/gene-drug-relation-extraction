 xxxd142xxx  ( xxxd142xxx ) is an aminothiol compound dephosphorylated at the tissue site by alkaline phosphatase to the
active metabolite, which is able to inactivate electrophilic substances and scavenge free radicals.  xxxd142xxx  effects against
 xxxd2562xxx -induced dna strand breaks were studied in normal
human white blood cells (wbc) and k562 leukemic cells using
the single cell gel electrophoresis (scge) or comet assay, a
reported method for measuring dna damage in individual cells.
prior to treatment (1 h, 37°c) with increasing doses of  xxxd2562xxx , with or without s9, the cells were treated (15 min, 37°c)
with a control medium or  xxxd142xxx  (3 mg/ml). treatment of
normal and leukemic cells with  xxxd2562xxx  induced a dosedependent ‘comet formation’.  xxxd2562xxx -induced dna damage
follows a normal distribution in wbc. on the other hand, in
k562, a significant proportion of undamaged cells remains
even with doses at which mean dna damage is serious. pretreatment with  xxxd142xxx  protects wbc, but not k562, against
the genotoxic effect of  xxxd2562xxx .  xxxd142xxx  might even
strengthen the action of the antiblastic drug against k562 cells.
s9 addition appears to enhance  xxxd2562xxx  effectiveness. scge
appears as a suitable primary screening method for in vitro and
in vivo studies on drug–dna interactions and their modulations
by endogenous/exogenous factors. leukemia (2000) 14, 1642–

introduction
the aminothiol  xxxd142xxx  ( xxxd142xxx ) and its active free thiol
wr-1065, which is able to scavenge free radicals and conjugate to electrophilic substances, have been shown to reduce
mutations from ionising radiation1–4 and selectively protect
normal but not neoplastic cells and tissues against the toxic
effect of different antineoplastic drugs.5–13 this selective protection is based on different membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase concentrations and different mechanisms of  xxxd142xxx  uptake.14,15
 xxxd2562xxx , a phenylalanine derivative of nitrogen mustard,
is an  xxxd3249xxx  used as a therapeutic. its reactivity with
dna can cause cell death. side-effects of treatment include
tissue toxicity and secondary malignancies, probably due to
the genetic damage induced. alkylating compounds mutagenicity is related to their ability to cross-link and/or produce
monoadducts to dna transferring an alkyl group.  xxxd2562xxx 
reacts at n7 of guanine, and also produces adenine–adenine
intrastrand cross-links in dna, which are proposed to be
responsible for early termination of transcription.16–18 the full

observed. in vivo data on  xxxd2562xxx  toxicity modification by
wr-272123–25 prompted us to evaluate the modulating effect
of  xxxd142xxx  with different genetic endpoints, in various
cellular systems.
the present study was undertaken to verify the selective
protective effect in vitro of  xxxd142xxx  against melphalaninduced genotoxicity in normal white blood cells (wbc) vs
the acute myelogenous leukemia cell line k562. although, to
our knowledge,  xxxd2562xxx  has never been tested in vitro with
exogenous metabolic activation, in this study its effectiveness
on dna was evaluated both with or without s9 mix since
nitrogen mustards are normally activated by the hepatic
cytochrome p-450 system in vivo.
we utilized k562 cells and normal wbc to better represent
susceptibility to the drug in vivo. indeed, from a clinical point
of view, a cytoprotective agent must be able to give selective
protection to normal vs tumor tissue from the actions
of chemotherapy. furthermore, our previous findings
(unpublished) had shown a complete lack of alkaline phosphatase in the k562 cell line, while its presence is known in
normal leukocytes.
after drug treatment, the cells were analyzed by alkaline
single cell gel electrophoresis assay (scge or comet test), a
technique allowing dna damage in a single cell to be shown
in an epi-fluorescence microscope.26,27 the comet test is able
to detect dna strand breaks, alkali labile sites and incomplete
excision repair events in individual cells.
dna damage in the form of single or double strand breaks
and alkali labile lesions may share dangerous mutagenic or
carcinogenic properties of chemicals. assays that measure
dna breaks generally require the unwinding of the double
stranded dna molecule for sensitive detection. a high ph is
used to facilitate the denaturation, unwinding and expression
of both single strand breaks and dna breaks that only
become apparent after exposure to alkali. alkaline
unwinding,28 alkaline filter elution,29 and alkaline dna precipitation30 assays require radiolabeling of dna for sensitive
detection of breaks and can only indicate the average number
of breaks per cell. the comet assay shows an exquisite sensitivity, without dna radiolabelling, and is able to measure
dna damage in individual cells. the ability to score damage
in a conspicuous number of individual cells gives it statistical
strength. furthermore, together with the assessment of in vivo
genotoxicity of chemicals in multiple organs31 or after
environmental and occupational exposure,32,33 it is an ideal
tool for assessing variability in the response of different cell
types in vitro.34,35 the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated dutp nick-end labeling (tunel) assay has also
proved to be a sensitive and reliable method for measuring
dna strand breaks. however, the detection of highly damaged cells by the comet assay occurred earlier than the detection of dna modifications by the tunel assay36 and more
sensitively.37 scge allowed a rapid analysis of genotoxic
damage in individual nuclei such as flow cytometry, and a
significant strong correlation was shown38,39 with a higher
sensitivity.40 furthermore, the comet assay detected highly

 xxxd142xxx  cell protection
a buschini et al

damaged cells much earlier than did the flow cytometry
method.41
scge, which requires only a small number of non-replicating cells and whose results can be obtained in a relatively
short time, agrees with sce induction42 and appears to be
more sensitive in revealing dna damage.43 the ratio between
the amount of dna breakage induced and the frequency of
micronuclei expressed in the following interphase is unclear.
with the development of scge it is possible to address this
question at the cellular level.44 an association between the
determination of repair proficiency in the comet assay and
the mean frequency of micronuclei was determined in lymphocytes.45 a relationship between the significantly increased
frequency of chromosome aberrations (ca) and cancer risk
was demonstrated in spite of ca unspecificity.46 studies
proved the comet assay to be more sensitive than ca47 and
a very strong association was shown between the two types of
damage,47,48 suggesting that the comet assay responses may
clearly predict cytogenetic damage.
materials and methods

chemicals
 xxxd142xxx  ( xxxd142xxx ) was provided by schering-plough (milan,
italy),  xxxd2562xxx  ( xxxd2562xxx ) was provided by wellcome (rome,
italy), and bleomycin (bleomicina) by rhône-poulenc rorer
(milan, italy); s9 was purchased from moltox (molecular
toxicology inc., boone, nc, usa) whereas styrene and all
other laboratory chemicals were purchased from sigmaaldrich (milan, italy).

cells
edta-anticoagulated peripheral blood was obtained by venipuncture from consenting healthy non-smoker donors. in
order to isolate leukocytes, the blood was centrifuged twice
in a lysis buffer (155 mm nh4cl, 5 mm khco3, 0.005 mm
na2edta, ph 7.4), washed with phosphate-buffered saline
(pbs) and resuspended (1 × 106 cells/ml) in rpmi-1640
medium (gibco, grand island, ny, usa).
the k562 acute myelogenous leukemia cell line was maintained in the suspension culture in rpmi-1640 supplemented
with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (fbs; stem cell technologies, vancouver, canada) and l-glutamine (2 mm). exponentially growing k562 cells, washed with pbs and resuspended
(1 × 106 cells/ml) in rpmi-1640 medium, were used throughout this study.

 xxxd2562xxx  and  xxxd142xxx  treatment
appropriate volumes of  xxxd2562xxx  and 0.1 m phosphate
buffer (ph 7.4) or s9-mix were added to an eppendorf tube
containing 1 ml cell suspension. s9 was prepared as described
by maron and ames.49 it was diluted 1:10 in 0.1 m phosphate
buffer (ph 7.4) containing nadp (4 mm), glucose-6-phosphate (5 mm), mgcl2 (8 mm), and kcl (33 mm) to constitute
s9-mix, 250 µl of which was added to each tube to make a
total of 1 ml cell suspension. the cells were treated at 37°c
with or without  xxxd142xxx  (3 mg/ml) 15 min prior to treatment
for 1 h at 37°c at different doses of  xxxd2562xxx , and then
washed twice in pbs. cell viability and apoptotic cells were

checked and the comet assay performed only with a viability
>95% (trypan blue exclusion method) and apoptotic cells
<4%. the apoptosis percentage was determined by tunel
assay.50

alkaline scge assay
scge was performed basically according to singh et al.26
degreased slides were previously dipped in 1% normal melting agarose for the first layer. the cells (|2 × 105 cells) were
then mixed with 85 µl of 0.7% low melting agarose (lma)
and placed on the first layer. lastly 85 µl of lma were added
as the top layer. the cells were lysed at 4°c in the dark, for
at least 1 h, in an ice-cold freshly prepared solution of 2.5 m
nacl, 10 mm na2edta, 10 mm tris-hcl, 1% triton x-100
and 10% dmso, ph 10. the slides were then placed on a
horizontal gel electrophoresis unit. the dna was allowed to
unwind for 20 min in an electrophoretic alkaline buffer (1 mm
na2edta, 300 mm naoh, ph 13) and subjected to electrophoresis for 20 min at 0.78 v/cm and 300 ma. alkali and
electrophoresis treatments were performed in an ice bath. all
the steps described above were performed under a yellow
light to prevent additional dna damage. once electrophoresis had been carried out, the slides were washed in a
neutralization buffer (0.4 m tris-hcl, ph 7.5) to remove alkali
and detergent. subsequently, the slides were dried and fixed
by immersion in absolute methanol for at least 60 s. the slides
were prepared in duplicate for each sample. immediately
before the examination, the dna was stained with 100 µl
ethidium bromide (2 µl/ml). the samples were examined at
400× magnification under a fluorescent microscope (leitz
 xxxd2511xxx  20; leitz, milan, italy) equipped with an excitation filter bp 515–560 nm and a barrier filter lp 580 nm, using an
automatic image analysis system (cometa release 2,1, sarin,
florence, italy). the image analysis system gives a quantitative
description of comets by various parameters such as migration
distance toward anode of dna fragments, between the edge
of the comet head and end of the tail, head diameter, and
percentage dna fluorescence intensity of total dna in the
head and tail of the comet. the tail moment is an integrated
value considering both the distance and amount of migrated
dna, ie tail length × tail %dna fluorescence intensity. the
comet parameter tail moment was chosen to represent the
data on genotoxic effects. one hundred cells (50 cells in two
slides) per sample, selected at random, were analyzed under
constant sensitivity.
the results are presented as frequency distributions of single
cell dna damage or as box and whisker plots. in this case
measured values at the tested concentrations are shown as
boxes that include 50% of the data. the top and bottom of
the boxes mark the 25th and 75th centiles and the inner line
marks the median value; 25% of data above the 75th centile
and 25% below the 25th centile are marked as ‘whiskers’
limited by the maximum or minimum values. outliers are
displayed as points.
a negative control (0.1% dmso) and positive controls
(100 µg/ml bleomycin and 50 µm styrene without and with s9
mix, respectively) were performed.
the samples were coded and evaluated blind. all tests were
generally performed three times.

cell survival assay
the cells were pre-treated with 0 or 3 mg/l of  xxxd142xxx  for
15 min, and then, as previously described, treated with various doses of  xxxd2562xxx , w/o s9-mix. the cells were washed,
then resuspended in rpmi-1640 and maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°c with 5% co2. cell survival was
detected by trypan blue exclusion 24 h after treatment. the
tests were performed in triplicate.

statistical analysis
the data were analyzed using the statistic and graphic functions of sigmaplot 5.0 and sigmastat 2.0. a one-way analysis
of the variance test was performed. if a significant f value
(p < 0.05) was obtained, the comparison between the grade
of dna damages was analyzed by using student’s t-test.
results
normal wbc and k562 leukemic cells, pre-incubated at 37°c
with or without  xxxd142xxx , were analyzed for the increase in
electrophoretic mobility of nuclear dna (comet formation)
after exposure to increasing concentrations of  xxxd2562xxx , with
or without s9 mix. a range of drug concentrations (0.25, 0.5,
1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5 and 15 µg/ml were previously tested
for cell toxicity. the chosen doses (0–10 µg/ml) were within

toxicity (70 and 55% in wbc, and 67 and 56% in k562,
respectively) were rejected.  xxxd142xxx  dose and time pretreatment were chosen from previous studies.10,51,52 three
independent experiments for each condition were performed
(tables 1 and 2). the average mean and the average median
tail moments are reported together with the average 95th percentiles. the dispersion of the tail moment, ie variance/mean,
is also shown.
bleomycin (100 µg/ml), used as a genotoxic agent able to
produce dna lesions just after treatment,53 displayed an
increase in dna damage (mean tail moments were
27.23 ± 1.68 µm in wbc and 30.27 ± 2.06 µm in k562,
respectively). styrene (50 µm), a compound which is metabolized by cytochrome p450 isozymes to reactive epoxides,54
was used both with and without s9 to show the effectiveness
of the s9 mix. styrene strongly induced dna damage in the
presence of exogenous metabolic activation (mean tail
moments were 40.78 ± 3.28 and 44.51 ± 3.88 µm in wbc
and k562, respectively). however, dna damage was also
observed without s9 (10.29 ± 0.37 vs 6.47 ± 0.44 µm in wbc
and 12.41 ± 1.16 vs 7.42 ± 0.26 µm in k562).

shown, both with and without s9 (table 1). with s9 addition,
mean tail moments for control wbc and wbc treated with
 xxxd2562xxx   xxxd1891xxx  µg/ml were 7.04 and 26.56 µm (student’s ttest p , 0.001), respectively. in the absence of s9, the mean
tail moment for wbc treated with  xxxd2562xxx   xxxd1891xxx  µg/ml was
increased three times as compared to the control wbc
(student’s t-test p , 0.001). the addition of microsomial
extract increased cell sensitivity; the first effective dose was
0.5 µg/ml (t-test p , 0.001) in wbc + s9 and 1 µg/ml (t-test
p , 0.01) in wbc − s9 (table 1). the presence of  xxxd142xxx 
determined considerable protection against the genotoxic
effectiveness of  xxxd2562xxx :  xxxd1891xxx  µg/ml, a significant effect
was evident (−s9: mean tail moment reduced to 10.55 µm vs
18.92 µm, t-test p , 0.001; +s9: 9.17 µm vs 26.56 µm, t-test
p , 0.001). furthermore, the first effective dose became
5 µg/ml both with (t-test p , 0.001) and without (t-test
p , 0.01) s9.

acute myelogenous leukemia cell line k562
 xxxd2562xxx  genotoxicity increases with larger doses of the
drug, both with and without exogenous metabolic activation
and irrespective of  xxxd142xxx  pre-treatment (table 2). when
k562 cell treatment was performed with no microsomial
extract, the first active doses were 0.5 µg/ml (t-test p , 0.001)
and 0.25 µg/ml (t-test p , 0.01) for  xxxd142xxx -treated and
untreated cells, respectively. in the presence of s9 mix, the

first dose with genotoxic effectiveness was 0.25 µg/ml both
with (t-test p , 0.05) and without (t-test p , 0.01)  xxxd142xxx .
pre-treatment with  xxxd142xxx  did not protect k562 cells from
the genotoxic action of  xxxd2562xxx .
the median and 95th percentile values, reported in tables 1
and 2, confirmed the protective effectiveness of the pro-drug
 xxxd142xxx  against dna damage induced by  xxxd2562xxx  in
wbc and its inefficacy in k562 cells. another difference
between wbc and k562 cells was the frequency distribution
of the amount of dna damage as shown by dispersion values.
the results of one (exp. no. 1) out of three independent
experiments for each condition are reported in figure 1 as box
and whisker plot. the different behavior of wbc and k562
cells in response to  xxxd142xxx  pre-treatment was evident both
in terms of cell population as well as individual cell response.
this latter point is better shown in figure 2, which reports
the frequency distribution of tail moment values for different
 xxxd2562xxx  concentrations, with (figure 2a) and without
(figure 2b) s9 mix, in one of the experiments. the data of
their positive controls are also reported (figure 2c). wbc are a
mixture of cell types, including monocytes, lymphocytes and
granulocytes, whereas k562 is an established cell line. this
might have suggested a distinct response from various cell
types for wbc,55 and a more regular response for k562. unexpectedly, sensitivity appeared to be quite similar in each of
the wbc cell types (frequency distributions maintain a similar
normal
distribution
at
the
increasing
 xxxd2562xxx 
concentrations). on the other hand, k562 cells showed a high

response variability with high drug resistance in subpopulations and a consequent onset of undesirable behavior against
drug effectiveness.
the mechanisms of dna damage induction appeared
different in wbc and k562 cells.
a good linear correlation between dna damage and  xxxd2562xxx  doses was evident in wbc. the s9 mix significantly
increased dna damage in wbc which were not pre-treated
with  xxxd142xxx  (one-way anova, p , 0.001, and t-test,
p < 0.001 for  xxxd2562xxx  concentrations >0.5 µg/ml, the first
effective dose in wbc + s9).
in k562 cells, a significant proportion of undamaged cells
remains even with doses at which dna damage is strong. the
addition of microsomal extract to k562 cells increased the
mean tail moment in the controls (±  xxxd142xxx ) whereas it
does not appear to influence the 95th percentile values
(table 2). however, a significant difference between cells
treated w/o s9 was shown both without (one-way anova,
p = 0.003) and with (one-way anova, p , 0.001)  xxxd142xxx .
pre-treatment with  xxxd142xxx  did not protect k562 cells.
leukemia

although in some cases  xxxd142xxx  appeared to strengthen
 xxxd2562xxx  effectiveness on dna, scientific justification to
support the data should be provided.
even if  xxxd2562xxx  is able to produce high dna damage,
‘ghost cells’, in which dna is extensively degraded allowing
most of the comet head to migrate under electrophoresis, were
not observed in either wbc or k562.
apoptosis data (<4%), detected by tunel assay immediately after treatment, confirm the lack of hedgehog cells such
as cell viability which, immediately after treatment, is
always >95%.
this high survival percentage does not preclude the later
appearance of cytotoxicity. therefore cell survival was measured after 24 h (table 3). in actual fact, the data do not show
any clear relationship with drug doses, cellular types or treatment (w/o  xxxd142xxx , w/o s9 mix). at the doses of  xxxd2562xxx 
used, efficient mechanisms can probably repair dna damage.
however, further investigations will have to be performed to
clarify these issues.

discussion
antiblastic drugs are characterized by a reduced therapeutic
index, ie difference between toxic and effective dose. sideeffects of treatment include tissue toxicity and secondary
malignancies, probably due to the genetic damage induced.
therefore, a selective protection of normal vs tumor tissues by
cytoprotective agents seems to be an important goal.  xxxd142xxx  has been reported to be a selective cytoprotective compound.5–13 the pro-drug  xxxd142xxx  is an organic thiophosphate compound dephosphorylated into the active metabolite
by membrane alkaline phosphatase at the target tissue.
in our study, the possible protective effects of  xxxd142xxx 
against  xxxd2562xxx -induced genotoxicity in human wbc from
healthy donors as well as in the k562 leukemic cell line was
detected by the scge assay.  xxxd142xxx  appears to selectively
protect healthy leukocytes but not k562 tumoral cells. this
selective action is mainly based on the efficient dephosphorylation of aminothiol by alkaline phosphatase in wbc, whereas
k562 cells are unable to activate  xxxd142xxx  for the complete
lack of membrane-bound enzyme. on the other hand,
 xxxd142xxx  strengthens  xxxd2562xxx  genotoxic effects in tumoral
cells. further investigations are required to provide scientific
rationale to clarify this effect.
the reaction of a nitrogen mustard such as  xxxd2562xxx  with
a dna base can be summarized. one 2-chloroethyl side

chain undergoes an intramolecular cyclization with release of
cl− and formation of a highly reactive intermediate that can
resemble a nucleophilic substitution reaction. for example,
alkylation of the n7 of guanine residues in dna may have
various effects of considerable biological importance, such as
abnormal base pair, labilization of imidazole ring with a possible ring cleavage or depurination by excision of base residues, cross-linking with a second base or another nucleophilic
moiety. any of these effects could adequately explain both
the mutagenic and the cytotoxic effects of the drug. in this
study we applied the alkaline scge assay to detect mainly
alkali labile sites. dna repair events might also be detected.
to be able to evaluate the contribution of repair, the treatment
should be performed at 4°c, that is, at a temperature that
slows down the enzymatic systems such as excision repair
processes.56 a detailed analysis of the molecular pharmacology of cross-linking drugs cannot be provided by this type
of assay. to identify the presence of cross-links, cells should
be exposed to dna-damaging agents such as ionizing radiation: the degree of migration inhibition can be used as a measure of dna cross-linking.57 the comet assay is a sensitive
test for the detection of a variety of dna lesions, but it does
not readily detect cross-linking agents in the test conditions
we adopted. however, our main goal was to evaluate whether
pre-treatment with  xxxd142xxx  could protect wbc, and not
k562 cells, against the effects of  xxxd2562xxx . on the other
leukemia

hand, we tried to relate the overall effects in the comet assay
to cytotoxic ones. in contrast to the clear concentrationrelated genotoxic effects seen for both wbc and k562 cells,
cell survival, determined 24 h after treatment, did not show
any clear relationship with drug doses.
all nitrogen mustards are chemically unstable but vary
greatly in their degree of instability. for example, cyclophosphamide requires biochemical activation by cytochrome
p-450 complex before its cytotoxicity becomes evident. in this
context, exogenous metabolic activation was included in the
assays to try to enhance the effects of  xxxd2562xxx .
s9 really enhances (about 1.5-fold) the effectiveness of this
phenylalanine derivative of nitrogen mustard, and at the same
time magnifies the  xxxd142xxx  protective action by reducing
the tail moment values at the same level detected in the
absence of s9 in wbc. this suggests the formation of a more
electrophilic compound than the original drug, which shows,
at the same time, a higher affinity both to dna and  xxxd142xxx : the increase of  xxxd2562xxx -induced dna damage could
be due to the formation of a more reactive derivative. this
also appears more efficient than parental compound in conjugating with  xxxd142xxx  derivative thiol that consequently shows
higher cytoprotective effects. in actual fact,  xxxd2562xxx  is a
substituted aniline, and aniline is a selective substrate towards
various cytochrome p450s.58–60 furthermore, ring hydroxylation can increase aniline genotoxicity, with the formation of
dna adducts.59
leukemia

on the other hand,  xxxd2562xxx  is also able to induce doserelated effects in wbc tested without s9 mix. our knowledge
concerning the xenobiotic-metabolizing capacity of fresh
human blood cells is rather limited, however, monocytes were
shown to constitutively express some p-450 enzymes.61
the k562 cells present a complex behavior in relationship
to s9 addition which increases tail moment values in the control group and at the same time protects against the genotoxic
effects of  xxxd2562xxx , specially at low doses (mean tail
moment increase/dose unit: 10.72 vs 15.48 µm and 7.09 vs
12.35 µm in  xxxd142xxx -treated and untreated cells,
respectively). culture conditions could influence the cell
response, however, further investigations need to be performed to clarify this point.
resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation represents a major obstacle in human cancer therapy. most of
the methods currently used to quantify dna damage are capable of providing measurements of average response, and, in
heterogeneous populations, averages are not sufficient to
describe the effects of physical and chemical agents. one of
the potential uses of the comet assay is to predict the response
of human tumor cells to therapy.62,63 the ability of this
method of detecting resistant and sensitive subpopulations of
tumour cells, is particularly valuable.35 in this study, the k562
cells showed a higher heterogeneity in dna damage than
wbc against  xxxd2562xxx  treatment. it can derive both from
genetic differences, such as cell subpopulations with various

 xxxd142xxx  cell protection
a buschini et al

figure 2

resistance/sensitivity to xenobiotics, and phenotypic differences related to cell cycle steps. cell cycle differences, which
are critical to cell survival, do not appear to influence tail
moment values in radiation-induced dna damage.62 the
same authors64 established that drugs such as etoposide,
selectively acting in proliferating cells, showed different tail
moment values in relation to the cell cycle differences. paclitaxel, an inhibitor of tubuline depolymerization, induced
single strand breaks on proliferating lymphocytes but not in
resting cells:56 dna damage could be linked to a direct dna
damaging effect on replicating cells but also to a high frequency of cells in the s-phase cycle. in another study,65,66
untreated exponentially growing cells in g1 phase showed a
lower tail moment than s and g2/m cells. the same cell cycle
dependence was evidenced in cells treated with low doses of
 xxxd2298xxx , while, at the highest doses, all cells
showed a similar level of damage.66  xxxd2562xxx  is not cell
cycle specific and may act on cells at any stage of the cycle,
thus suggesting the probable presence of genetically determined  xxxd2562xxx -resistant subpopulations. however, the analysis of a cell population, with prolonged survival, that is able
to renew itself and provide an adequate model for hematoprotection studies,13 could provide additional results to those
observed for wbc and also a better comparison with k562
cells (ie cell cycle with a similar s/g2/m cumulative phase
percent). furthermore, the influence of cell cycle status on
 xxxd2562xxx  genotoxicity and dna protection by  xxxd142xxx 
might be clarified.66
when the aim is to cause the tumoral cells to became sterile, the critical factor is not whether they all resist an appropriate level of dna damage but rather if some do escape sufficient damage. our data (table 3) show that dna damage
assessment proved inadequate in predicting survival following
 xxxd2562xxx  treatment. this may depend on the doses used,
which were selected for their low cytotoxicity. however, the
significant proportion of undamaged cells which remains even
at doses that determine a high mean dna damage is more
likely itself to repopulate the tumor. furthermore, the normal
level of apoptosis, detected by tunel assay and the lack of
‘ghost cells’ in the comet assay can confirm the specificity of
 xxxd2562xxx -induced genotoxicity in treated cells.
our results appear to be in line with previous reports show-

ing hematoprotection in normal and enhanced drug-induced
toxicity in leukemic cells by  xxxd142xxx . in particular, the dual
effect of  xxxd142xxx  protection of normal wbc coupled with
 xxxd142xxx -induced sensitization of the acute myelogenous
leukemia cell line k562 towards  xxxd2562xxx  can suggest its
potential application for removing contaminating tumoral
cells in bone marrow purging.52
in conclusion,  xxxd142xxx  selective protection against  xxxd2562xxx -induced dna damage in normal and tumoral cells
was stated by using the comet assay. the relevance of the
protective action exerted by  xxxd142xxx  on normal hematopoietic cells should be tested in appropriate clinical settings,
eg, patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy who are
exposed to a significant chemotherapy-related toxicity on
normal hematopoietic cells. such toxicity together with the
associated genetic damage might in turn represent the first hit
triggering secondary neoplastic events.
the selective  xxxd142xxx -mediated protection in normal
blood cells from  xxxd2562xxx  genotoxicity and the contemporary improvement of drug action on k562 cells confirm52 the
potential application of this aminothiol also for bone
marrow purging.
while many methods are population-based assays which
assume that all cells within a population respond in a similar
manner to a dna-damaging drug, the comet assay confirms
that it provides adequate resolution in detecting the presence
of cell subpopulations with different sensitivity. specific information regarding direct genotoxicity of drugs and dna repair
can be obtained in cells which are not in apoptosis and also
by modifying the assay.56,57,67,68 the findings indicate the suitability of this technique as a primary screening method for in
vitro and in vivo studies on drug–dna interactions and their
modulations by endogenous/exogenous factors.
