abstract
it is not known to what extent glucocorticoid hormones cause their anti-inflammatory actions and their
undesirable side effects by the same or different molecular mechanisms. glucocorticoids combine
with a cytoplasmic receptor that alters gene expression in two ways. one way is dependent on the
receptor’s binding directly to dna and acting (positively or negatively) as a transcription factor. the
other is dependent on its binding to and interfering with other transcription factors. both mechanisms
could underlie suppression of inflammation. the liganded receptor binds and inhibits the inflammatory
transcription factors  xxxg1222xxx  and  xxxg1559xxx . it also directly induces anti-inflammatory genes
such as that encoding the protein inhibitor of  xxxg1559xxx . recent work has shown that glucocorticoids
inhibit signalling in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways that mediate the expression of
inflammatory genes. this inhibition is dependent on de novo gene expression. it is important to
establish the significance of these different mechanisms for the various physiological effects of
glucocorticoids, because it may be possible to produce steroid-related drugs that selectively target
the inflammatory process.

introduction
the anti-inflammatory action of glucocorticoid hormones
was discovered by hench and colleagues over 50 years
ago [1]. hench had noted that the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis were often improved in pregnancy and when
a patient had jaundice, both situations in which, he reasoned, there was an increase in steroids in the body. the
active substances of the adrenal cortex had then recently
been isolated by reichstein and kendall and shown to be
steroids. it seemed possible that these might alleviate
inflammatory symptoms. hench and his co-workers found
that small doses of cortisone dramatically improved the
symptoms of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. hench,

kendall, and reichstein were jointly awarded the nobel
prize in physiology and medicine in 1950. powerful synthetic glucocorticoids were then developed, which,
despite their unwelcome side effects, became and remain
mainstays of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive
therapy.
the side effects of glucocorticoids that severely limited
their use were osteoporosis, diabetes, hypertension,
cataracts, thinning of the skin, and the characteristic
appearance of cushing’s syndrome. they also suppressed the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and
arrested growth. their potency in suppressing inflamma-

mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by glucocorticoids (adapted from m karin [3]). liganded grs (ovals with patches) regulate transcription
by direct binding to dna elements (gres) or by binding to other transcription factors (tethering). gre-regulated and  xxxg1559xxx /ap-1-regulated
promoters are shown schematically with single binding sites; typically, there may be one or several sites. interference with the activity of ap-1
(open and dark ovals) or  xxxg1559xxx  (open and dark squares) after tethering could be a direct effect on the factors’ function, or it could be an
interaction with coactivators or components of the tic. ap-1 =  xxxg1222xxx ; gr =  xxxg1601xxx ; gre = glucocorticoid response
element;  xxxg1559xxx  = nuclear factor-kappab; tic = transcriptional initiation complex.

tion stimulated much investigation into their mechanism of
action. glucocorticoids inhibit expression of many of the
genes involved in inflammatory and immune responses.
these include those encoding cytokines, chemokines,
cell-surface receptors, adhesion molecules,  xxxg748xxx ,
degradative proteinases, and enzymes such as cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 and  xxxg1578xxx ,
which produce inflammatory mediators.
the  xxxg1601xxx  (gr) [2] binds to specific
dna sequences – glucocorticoid response elements
(gres) – which may be positive or negative, either activating or repressing transcription, respectively (fig. 1). in the
absence of ligand, the receptor is cytoplasmic and is complexed with chaperones, including hsp90,  xxxg799xxx 
(immunophilin), and  xxxg323xxx . upon ligand binding to
the receptor, the chaperones are shed, exposing nuclear
localisation signals. the receptor dimerises when it binds
to a gre. genes that are positively regulated by gres
include those involved in gluconeogenesis, such as those
for  xxxg2250xxx ,  xxxg941xxx ,
and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. examples of
genes negatively regulated by gres are those for  xxxg1801xxx  (the acth precursor) and prolactin. the
genes responsible for such side effects of glucocorticoids
as osteoporosis, diabetes, and hypertension are largely
unknown. understanding the transcriptional basis of the
different physiological effects is important because it may
be possible to develop more selective agents, which
target the inflammatory process.

glucocorticoid receptors interact with
inflammatory transcription factors
no genes responding positively to glucocorticoid hormones have been identified that explain the profound suppression of the inflammatory response. furthermore,
genes of the inflammatory response lack repressing
gres, so other explanations for the suppression of inflammation have been sought [3,4]. currently, it is thought that
a major mechanism is transcriptional interference (see
fig. 1). inflammatory-response genes are typically regulated by the transcription factors  xxxg1559xxx  and activator
protein-1 (ap-1). the liganded gr interacts with ap-1
complexes (generally c-jun/c-fos heterodimers) and prevents their transcriptional activity [3,4]. similar tethering
occurs with  xxxg1559xxx  [5,6]. this interference between transcription factors is reciprocal: not only can gr prevent the
function of ap-1 and  xxxg1559xxx , but also ap-1 and  xxxg1559xxx  can
prevent transcriptional activation by gr. the physiological
significance of these mechanisms is still speculative and
the interactions between the endogenous proteins have
been difficult to demonstrate in vivo. another possible
explanation for the functional competition between ap-1,
 xxxg1559xxx , and gr is that they compete for the transcriptional
coactivators  xxxg516xxx  (cbp) and p300 [7,8].
however, this notion is controversial.
an additional mechanism of transcriptional interference
has been recently proposed [9]. corticosteroid interferes
with il-1-induced gene activation by inhibiting the histone
acetylation that loosens chromatin structure, and enables

glucocorticoids may act (1) by transcriptional interference and (2) by inhibiting map kinases. the left side represents glucocorticoid (g) combining
with its receptor (gr) and inducing gene expression by binding to dna glucocorticoid response elements (gres). the right side shows an
inflammatory stimulus (e.g. lipopolysaccharide, il-1,  xxxg2296xxx ) activating protein kinase cascades (see fig. 3) and inducing
inflammatory response genes. (1) transcriptional interference is due to the liganded gr directly binding the transcription factors  xxxg1222xxx 
and nuclear factor-kappab and inhibiting their action. (2) glucocorticoid-induced genes, possibly mkps, inhibit map kinase signalling pathways by
keeping them in the dephosphorylated state. this would inhibit both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms underlying inflammatory
gene expression. map = mitogen-activated protein; mkp = map kinase phosphatase.

access of transcription factors to their dna binding sites
[9]. the liganded gr bound to the transcriptional complexes inhibits their acetyltransferase activity. this could
be an adjunct to the mechanism of tethering of transcription factors.
glucocorticoids may also interfere with  xxxg1559xxx  activation
by a mechanism dependent upon de novo gene expression.  xxxg1559xxx  is sequestered in the cytoplasm with an
inhibitor,  xxxg1561xxx , whose degradation is induced by inflammatory stimuli. production of this inhibitor is increased by
dexamethasone [10,11]. this effect is slow and its physiological significance remains to be established.

dexamethasone interferes with pathways of
mitogen-activated protein kinase
recently, another possible mechanism for glucocorticoid
action has become apparent: dexamethasone inhibits signalling in mitogen-activated protein kinase (map kinase)
pathways, which are activated by inflammatory stimuli [12].
this suggests that glucocorticoids may block inflammatory
signalling at a level above transcription factor activation.
the effect, unlike transcriptional interference, requires gene
induction, possibly of a map kinase phosphatase (mkp),
and could inhibit both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms controlled by the map kinases (fig. 2).

there are three types of map kinase [13] and they participate in distinct phosphorylation cascades (fig. 3). the
prototype map kinase is the extracellularly regulated
kinase (erk), or p42, which is activated by many stimuli.
the other two, the c- xxxg1370xxx  (jnk) and p38,
are very strongly activated by inflammatory stimuli such as
il-1,  xxxg2296xxx , and microbial products (e.g.
lipopolysaccharide), and by cellular stress (e.g. uv). the
map kinases are activated by their specific map kinase
kinases (mkks) by dual phosphorylation of a motif comprising a threonyl and a tyrosyl residue separated by a
single amino acid. the map kinases phosphorylate various
substrates, including other protein kinases. at the bottom
of the cascades lie proteins controlling gene expression
and other processes.
serving to modulate the activity of map kinases and to
switch off the pathways after the response to a stimulus,
are mkps [14]. these dual-specificity phosphatases
remove phosphates from both the threonyl and tyrosyl
residues in the map kinase activation motifs. more than
12 of these phosphatases are known to exist, differing in
expression, subcellular localisation, and specificity for the
different map kinases. since removal of phosphate from
either threonyl or tyrosyl residues inactivates the
enzymes, they may also be regulated by phospho-

and

the three map kinase pathways, in addition to the protein
kinase system that activates  xxxg1559xxx  by phosphorylating the
inhibitor ikappab, are the major signalling systems through
which genes of the inflammatory response are activated.
such genes are activated by several transcription factors
and typically, as mentioned earlier,  xxxg1559xxx  and ap-1 are
crucial. the jnk pathway is a major route for activation of
c-jun, and therefore of ap-1 complexes. the mrnas of
many cytokines and key regulators of the inflammatory
response are unstable by virtue of clustered auuua
motifs in their 3′ untranslated regions [15]. the p38 map
kinase pathway stabilises such mrnas [16–21]. it is presumed that downstream kinases regulate proteins that
bind to the instability motifs.
the role of the  xxxg1368xxx  pathway has been elucidated by studying its effect on the function of the 3′
untranslated regions of the cox-2 [20] and il-8 mrnas
[21]. because dexamethasone destabilises some mrnas,
including the mrna of cox-2 [22], its mechanism was
investigated. it antagonised the stabilising action of the

 xxxg1368xxx  on the cox-2 3′ utr. this raised the
possibility that dexamethasone was inhibiting p38 map
kinase. there had been reports that glucocorticoids inhibited jnk activity in cells [23,24] and suppressed activity of
the erk cascade in mast cells [25]. treating cells with dexamethasone for 1–2 hours before stimulation inhibited the
activation of both  xxxg1368xxx  and jnk by uv light, by
il-1, or by bacterial lipopolysaccharide [12]. we know that
this inhibition was at the level of the map kinase, because
dexamethasone had no effect on the p38 activator, mkk6,
and the inhibition could be circumvented by transfecting an
active mutant of the substrate of p38, the map kinase-activated protein kinase-2 [12]. the effect of dexamethasone
on the  xxxg1368xxx  was dependent upon gr and de
novo mrna synthesis.
an explanation for these findings is that steroids induce a
protein phosphatase that keeps the  xxxg1368xxx  (and
jnk) in the dephosphorylated state. alternatively, the
steroid could be inducing a molecule that inhibits the
mkks. it will be interesting to know the basis of the map
kinase inhibition, its dependence on gre-regulated
genes, and its importance in inflammation relative to the
mechanism of transcriptional interference.
