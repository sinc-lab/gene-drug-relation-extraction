background: the endogenous opioid system has been linked to alcohol dependence through animal and human studies. we
investigated the relationship between alcohol craving and brain mu opioid receptors (␮-or) in alcohol-dependent subjects.
methods: regional brain ␮-or binding potential (bp) was measured using [11c] xxxd440xxx  positron emission tomography in eight
male alcohol-dependent subjects undergoing alcohol withdrawal and eight matched control subjects. self-reported alcohol craving,
withdrawal, and mood were measured.
results: lower ␮-or bp was associated with higher craving in the right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, the right anterior frontal
cortex, and right parietal cortex. in these regions, alcoholics showed lower mean ␮-or bp compared with control subjects. mu-or bp
in four other brain regions also correlated with craving, but there were no group differences in receptor binding potential. mu-or bp
also correlated with depressive symptoms in five brain regions, three of which were identified in the craving analyses.
conclusions: results show a strong functional relationship between alcohol craving, mood, and ␮-or binding in specific brain
regions of recently abstinent, alcohol-dependent men.

o

ver the last two decades, preclinical and clinical research has generated compelling data demonstrating the
involvement of the endogenous opioid system in alcohol reinforcement and consumption. for example, it is clear that
opioid agonist and antagonist administration alter alcohol consumption. studies have demonstrated increased alcohol intake
following administration of modest doses of morphine in rodents
(hubbell et al 1986; linseman and harding 1990; czirr et al 1987;
reid et al 1987, 1991) and decreased alcohol consumption
following administration of the nonselective opioid receptor
antagonists naloxone (froehlich et al 1990; hubbell et al 1986;
marfaing-jallat et al 1983; reid et al 1991; samson and doyle
1985; weiss et al 1990), naltrexone (altshuler et al 1980; kornet
et al 1991; myers et al 1986; volpicelli et al 1986), and nalmefene
(hubbell et al 1991). antagonists that are selective for the mu and
 xxxg1632xxx  types also have been shown to decrease
alcohol self-administration in rodents and monkeys under a
variety of experimental conditions (froehlich et al 1995; krishnan-sarin et al 1995a, 1995b). similarly, in human laboratory
studies of the acute effects of naltrexone administration on
alcohol intoxication, subjects reported reduced positive reinforcing stimulant effects and increased sedative effects of alcohol
following naltrexone compared with placebo administration

(mccaul et al 2000; swift et al 1994). recent human laboratory
studies also have found reliable reductions in alcohol consumption during naltrexone compared with placebo administration (drobes et al 2003; o’malley et al 2002). finally,
clinical trials have demonstrated that the opioid antagonist
naltrexone reduced alcohol drinking, alcohol craving, and relapse rates in alcoholics (o’malley 1996; o’brien et al 1996);
however, not all studies have shown a positive outcome (krystal
et al 2001).
a second line of evidence for functional involvement of the
opioid system in mediating alcohol drinking behavior comes
from neurobiological studies indicating that alcohol alters opioid
peptide systems. acute alcohol administration increases ␤-endorphin and enkephalin gene expression in discrete brain regions of
rodents and increases opioid peptide release from brain (cowen
et al 2001; gianoulakis 1990; li et al 1998). chronic ethanol
administration has been shown to decrease ␤-endorphin levels
in several brain regions, whereas ␤-endorphin synthesis and
release are generally increased (gianoulakis 1983; schulz et al
1980).
the third line of evidence for functional involvement of the
opioid system in mediating alcohol drinking is derived from
genetic studies indicating that a genetic predisposition toward
alcohol drinking is accompanied by increased responsiveness of
the opioid system to alcohol in both rodents (li et al 1996).
moreover, cortisol responses to opioid blockade have been
reported to differ in subjects with and without a family history of
alcoholism (wand et al 1998, 2001).
in persons seeking alcoholism treatment, craving is associated
with relapse (flannery et al 1999; roberts et al 1999). a change
in ␮-or availability has been hypothesized to be associated with
increased alcohol craving, relapse, and the therapeutic response
to treatment with opioid antagonists (mann et al 2001). therefore, in this study, we hypothesized that regional brain ␮-or bp
is correlated with alcohol craving. following alcohol withdrawal,
we measured the brain distribution of ␮-or in alcohol-dependent subjects using [11c] xxxd440xxx  positron emission tomography (pet). regional ␮-or bp was correlated with multiple
behavioral measures, including alcohol craving, mood, and
withdrawal severity.

methods and materials
subjects
subjects were recruited via advertisement, provided informed
consent in the sober state, using an institutional review board–
approved informed consent document. subjects were then interviewed using a battery of diagnostic and psychological instruments. subjects met dsm-iv criteria for alcohol dependence
based on the semi-structured assessment of the genetics of
alcoholism (bucholz et al 1994) and were actively drinking at
hazardous levels (i.e., consuming 60 or more drinks per month
and at least 5 drinks per occasion weekly). individuals were
excluded if they met current dsm-iv diagnostic criteria for any
other axis i disorder, including drug abuse/dependence, if urine
drug toxicology was positive at screening or hospital admission,
or if they had other ongoing health problems. subjects also were
screened for prior alcohol withdrawal symptomatology and were
excluded if they reported alcohol-related seizures or the need for
medication during previous detoxifications.
eight alcohol-dependent men were enrolled and underwent
pet brain imaging. psychological data were available on seven
subjects. demographic characteristics included: 38 ⫾ 4 years old;
77% white and 23% black; 14 ⫾ 3 years old at first drink; and 20
⫾ 4 years dependent drinking. three subjects were tobacco free,
three subjects were light smokers (1–9 cigarettes/day), and one
subject smoked approximately one pack per day. subjects were
admitted to the johns hopkins hospital general clinical research center. the average clinical institute withdrawal assessment—alcohol revised (ciwa-ar; sullivan et al 1989) score over
the 5-day period was 4.6 ⫾ 3.3 sd, range of mean scores ⫽
1–10); no subject required withdrawal medication based on
ciwa scores. subjects could smoke ad libitum during their
hospitalization but smoking was restricted for 3 hours before the
pet scan procedures.
clinical assessments
psychosocial instruments included the semi-structured assessment of the genetics of alcoholism (bucholz et al 1994), the
beck depression inventory (bdi; beck et al 1988), the symptom
checklist—90 revised (derogatis 1983), and the profile of mood
states (poms) (mcnair et al 1992). the obsessive–compulsive
drinking scale (ocds; anton et al 1996; moak et al 1998) was
obtained three times daily throughout the stay. subjects were
instructed to mark the ocds items to reflect the time period
since the last measurement. total scores as well as obsession
(obs), resistance/control impairment (rci), and interference
(int) subscales were computed. the 5-day mean and peak
craving scores were computed for the total ocd and its subscales.
pet image acquisition
on day 4, subjects underwent pet imaging using c-11
 xxxd440xxx  (cfn) a specific ␮-opioid agonist. the pet scans
were acquired in 2d mode on ge 4096 plus pet scanner (ge
medical systems, milwaukee, wisconsin). images were simultaneously collected of 15 contiguous planes with an axial field-ofview of 10.5 cm. a transmission scan of 10 min duration was
obtained using rotating germanium-68 rods before injection of
the radiotracer. following after the intravenous bolus administration of 20 ⫾ 2 mci of [11c]- xxxd440xxx , twenty-five sets of
images with variable time period (6 ⫻ 30 sec, 5 ⫻ 60 sec, 5 ⫻ 120
sec, 9 ⫻ 480 sec) were acquired during a 90-min period for each
study. after correction for attenuation using the transmission

b. bencherif et al
scan, images were reconstructed in a 128 ⫻ 128 ⫻ 15 matrix with
pixel size of 2 ⫻ 2 ⫻ 6.5 mm with filtered back projection
method using a ramp filter and decay-corrected.
image analysis
the 0 –90 min average images of each subject were first
spatially normalized to the c-11 cfn template in the montreal
neurologic institute (mni) space. the transformation functions
obtained from 0 –90 min average images were applied to the
corresponding 34 – 82 min average image. stereotaxic normalization used a 12-parameter affine transformation. the residual
differences between the transformed images and template were
minimized using nonlinear deformation that consists of a linear
combination of three-dimensional discrete cosine transform basis
functions (7 ⫻ 8 ⫻ 7) and 12 nonlinear iterations with medium
nonlinear regularization. parametric maps of the binding potential (bp) of ␮-or were derived from the spatially normalized
average 34 – 82 images using tissue ratio methods (bp ⫽ countregion/countoccipital – 1). the bp images were smoothed by
convolution with an isotropic gaussian kernel with 10-mm full
width at half maximum to reduce residual intersubject anatomic
differences and to increase the signal-to-noise ratio at the expense of resolution.
the relationship of regional ␮-or binding and craving or
withdrawal score was assessed at each voxel using general linear
model in spm99 (institute of neurology, university college of
london). analysis of covariance was used to remove the confounding effect (nuisance covariate) of intersubject differences in
global ␮-or binding. the mean global binding was computed
on a subset of data greater than whole mean/8. this had the
effect of removing pixels of very low or negative ␮-or binding.
the analysis threshold was set to ⬎ 50% of the mean global
computed by spm99 for each subject to retain only ␮-or binding
in gm regions. the following analysis of variance model was
then fitted at each voxel; yjk ⫽ ␣ ⫹ ␤1(score) ⫹ ␤2(gj⫺ gm) ⫹ epsilonjk.
in this equation, yjk denotes ␮-or binding at the kth voxel in the
jth subject. ␣ and ␤1 denotes regression intercept and slope
between ␮-or binding and craving or withdrawal score entered
as covariate of interest, respectively, ␤2(gj ⫺ gm) is for global
binding and epsilonjk is residual error. the positive and negative
correlation between ␮-or binding and the clinical scores were
assessed using respectively contrasts [⫹1 0 0] and [⫺1 0 0]. spm
t maps were thresholded at p ⱕ .005 and clusters of voxels were
retained if their spatial extent k (number of voxels) at this
threshold had a corrected probability (p.corr) of occurrence of ⱕ
.05 over the entire brain (friston et al 1995). the mean adjusted
value of ␮-or binding from all voxels in significant clusters
shown by the correlational analysis in spm was obtained. as a
separate analysis, the correlation between each clinical score and
adjusted mean ␮-or binding for each cluster was performed
using general linear model in spss 11.5 (spss, inc., chicago,
illinois).
for comparison analyses, we selected from an existing database a group of eight healthy, non-alcohol-dependent men
matched for age. mean age of comparison subjects was 37.4 ⫾
5.7 sd (29 – 46 range). three subjects were african american,
and five subjects were caucasian.
from each control subject image, which had already been
spatially normalized and smoothed with same methods, the
mean value of ␮-or binding was obtained in the same spatial
location as the significant clusters observed in alcohol-dependent subjects. the mean values of normalized ␮-or binding

results
craving and ␮-or binding
mean ocds scores are presented for each subject in table 1.
negative correlations were observed between the adjusted ␮-or
binding and ocds scores in seven brain regions (table 2). in
three of those regions, differences in ␮-or binding between
alcoholic and control subjects were also observed. specifically, in
the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (pfc), binding was significantly correlated with all subscales as well as mean and peak
total ocds score (table 2, figure 1a–c). in the regression
analysis between each craving score and mean ␮-or binding in
the cluster derived from spm results, the correlation coefficients
ranged from .980 to .999. (table 2, figure 1c). in addition, the
alcoholic patients had significantly lower ␮-or binding in this
region compared to healthy control subjects (table 2, figure 1e)
the second prominent region showing correlation was observed
in the right anterior frontal cortex (afc). in the right anterior
frontal cortex, binding was significantly correlated with mean
total ocd, mean obs, and mean and peak rci (table 2, figure
1b–d). in this region as well, the regional ␮-or binding was
significantly lower in alcoholic patients compared with healthy
subjects (table 2, figure 1f). in the right parietal cortex, binding
was significantly correlated with mean and peak obs, and
differences in binding were observed, with control subjects
having greater ␮-or binding potential than alcoholics (table 2).
also in the right parietal cortex, significant correlations between
␮-or binding potential and other ocd scores were observed;
however, no differences in ␮-or binding potential were found
between alcoholic and control subjects. in four additional regions (left dorsolateral pfc, left tempoparietal cortex, left parietal
cortex, left lateral temporal cortex) correlations between ␮-or

binding potential and ocd scores were found, but no group
differences in ␮-or binding potential were detected (table 2).
mood and ␮-or binding potential
mean bdi scores are presented for each subject in table 1. as
with the craving score, negative correlations were observed
between the adjusted ␮-or binding and bdi scores in the right
dorsolateral pfc (table 3, figure 2a–c), right parietal cortex, and
left temporoparietal cortex (table 3). a significantly decreased
mean ␮-or binding in right dorsolateral pfc in alcoholic patients
compared with healthy control subjects was also found (figure
2e). in contrast, positive correlations were observed between
␮-or and bdi scores in the left thalamus (table 3, figure 2b–d)
and anterior cingulate gyrus (table 3). the mean ␮-or binding
in the thalamic region was significantly higher in alcoholic
patients compared with control subjects (table 3, figure 2f);
however, we did not observe any correlations between total
poms scores and ␮-or binding potential.
alcohol withdrawal and ␮-or binding potential
we did not observe any correlations between ciwa-ar scores
and ␮-or binding potential in any brain regions.

discussion
this study is the first to demonstrate a functional relationship
between alcohol craving and the endogenous opioid system.
high craving was consistently associated with lower ␮-or
binding potential across several brain regions in alcoholics
undergoing withdrawal. it is noteworthy that alcoholic compared
with control subjects had lower ␮-or binding potential in many
of the identified regions. we also observed relationships between depressive symptoms and ␮-or binding potential in
several brain regions, three of which overlapped with brain
regions associated with craving. in those common brain regions,
lower ␮-or binding potential was associated with increased

craving as well as increased symptoms of depression. we did not
observe a relationship between severity of alcohol withdrawal
and ␮-or binding potential in any brain region; this may have
resulted from relatively low withdrawal severity in our study
subjects.
there are several possible mechanisms for our observation of
lower ␮-or binding potential in alcohol-dependent compared
with control subjects. first, we have previously shown that the
offspring of alcoholics, who have increased risk for alcohol
dependence, have altered opioidergic activity compared with
individuals negative for family history of alcohol dependence
(wand at al 1998, 1999, 2001). it is therefore conceivable that
people who are alcohol dependent inherit a tendency for lower
␮-or binding potential, a condition that places them at risk for
the disorder. second, it is plausible that the lower ␮-or binding
potential observed in the alcohol-dependent subjects was secondary to their previous bouts of heavy drinking or resulted from
acute neurochemical fluxes associated with withdrawal from
alcohol. enhanced release of opioids during withdrawal may
have resulted in down regulation of ␮-or binding potential.
it should be noted that a reduction in ␮-or binding potential
may result from a true reduction in the number or binding affinity
of the ␮-or. alternatively, decreased  xxxd440xxx  binding may
result from increased levels of endogenous opioid peptides in
competition with 11c  xxxd440xxx  during the time of the study.
www.elsevier.com/locate/biopsych

the latter scenario would imply that during early abstinence,
opioid activity is high; therefore, the case for using an opiate
antagonist for treatment is more strongly made. limitations in
current pet technology do not allow us to identify the exact
mechanism of change.
the negative relationship between craving and ␮-opioid
receptor binding suggests that factors that attenuate opioid
receptor signaling will intensify alcohol craving. the dual observation that alcohol-dependent subjects have low ␮-or binding
potential compared with control subjects and that there is a
strong negative correlation between alcohol craving and ␮-or
binding potential suggests that naltrexone’s therapeutic efficacy
is achieved by it ability to block alcohol reinforcement rather
than by attenuating craving. in fact, we would hypothesize that
naltrexone administered early in alcohol withdrawal might intensify craving. this observation is in line with earlier reports of a
relationship between the intensity of naltrexone-related side
effects and duration of alcohol abstinence at the time that
naltrexone treatment is initiated (o’malley et al 2000).
our findings on alcohol craving are consistent with recent
reports of specific brain regions associated with cocaine craving.
using [18f]fluorodeoxyglucose (fdg) pet, cocaine users demonstrated increased metabolism in several brain regions, including the dorsolateral pfc and temporal lobes after exposure to
cocaine-related cues (grant et al 1996). in another study with

abstinent cocaine abusers, regional cerebral metabolic rate for
glucose in the orbital frontal cortex and dorsoprefrontal area
were correlated with cocaine craving (volkow et al 1991). using
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri), cocaine users
showed significantly increased activity in the anterior cingulate
and left dorsolateral pfc while viewing drug-related scenes
(maas et al 1998).
much less is known about the brain regions associated with
alcohol craving; however, a recent study has shown that the left
dorsolateral pfc and thalamus have greater activity as assessed
by fmri during alcohol cue exposure in alcoholics (george et al
2001). our study extends these findings by showing a correlation

a

between ␮-or binding and alcohol craving in the dorsolateral
pfc as well as in regions associated with cue-induced cocaine
craving. although the sample size is small, the correlations are
strong. the correlations were observed for the ocds subscales
that measure the severity and ability to control drinking related
thoughts and impulses as well for total ocds scores (roberts et
al 1999). furthermore, in a subset of the brain regions in which
␮-or binding potential negatively correlated with craving, alcoholic subjects had lower mean ␮-or binding compared with
control subjects. why these group differences in ␮-or binding
potential were not seen across all brain regions that correlated
with craving is unclear.

we have previously shown a positive association between
obsessive– compulsive symptomology and endogenous opioid
activity in the offspring of people with alcoholism (mangold et al
2000). studies have also shown obsessive– compulsive symptomology in alcohol-dependent men during early (mercier et al
1992) and extended abstinence (desoto et al 1985). there has
been speculation about the similarities between obsessive–
compulsive symptoms and the experience of craving (anton
1996; kranzler and anton 1994; modell et al 1992). based on
these observations, a  xxxd1751xxx -limbic-basal ganglia-thalamic circuit
in obsessive– compulsive symptomology involving the medial
orbital gyri, the head of the caudate nucleus, and the nucleus
accumbens has been proposed as an opioidergic pathway involved in ethanol reward and obsessive– compulsive symptomology (baxter et al 1992).
interestingly, we also observed highly significant correlations
between depressive symptoms as measured by the beck depression inventory and ␮-or binding potential in several brain
regions. in right dorsolateral pfc, right parietal, and left temporoparietal cortex, lower ␮-or binding potential was associated with increased symptoms of depression. strikingly, a similar
relationship between ␮-or binding potential and craving was
observed in these same three regions. we also found positive
correlations between ␮-or binding potential and depressive
scores in the anterior cingulate gyrus and the left thalamus.
previous imaging studies in depressed patients have also identified several of these regions as having alterations in metabolic
rates including limbic–paralimbic regions (cingulate, anterior
insula) and neocortical regions (right dorsolateral prefrontal,
orbital frontal cortex; mayberg et al 1999); prefrontal cortex
including the cingulate gyrus, thalamus, and temporal cortex
(brody et al 2001); and the amygdala (whalen et al 2002).
moreover treatment intervention has been associated with normalization of metabolic rate in the prefrontal cortex, left anterior
cingulate gyrus, and left temporal lobe (brody et al 1999, 2001).
our findings are the first to show a relationship between mood
and ␮-or binding potential in specific brain regions.
both craving and symptoms of depression were negatively
correlated with ␮-or binding potential in three brain regions.
this is an intriguing overlap and raises questions regarding the
relationship between symptoms of depression and alcohol craving. unfortunately, there is a paucity of empirical evidence to
inform us about this relationship. alcoholic patients often report
that their relapses occur during negative mood states including
depression (marlatt and gordon 1985). tiffany (1990) has theorized that craving is more closely associated with negative
compared with positive mood states. it is also well recognized
that craving and depression often move in parallel during
withdrawal from alcohol (kiefer et al 2002). moreover, craving
www.elsevier.com/locate/biopsych

for alcohol, cocaine, and opiates can be triggered by negative
mood induction (childress et al 1994; litt et al 1990). these
relationships suggest that a common neural circuitry may underlie both states.
there were a number of procedural strengths to the study
design. conducting the study on the inpatient general clinical
research center (gcrc) ensured alcohol abstinence, the opportunity to repeatedly collect subjective measures over the 5-day
stay, and to safely avoid the confound of medicated withdrawal.
smoking rates among alcohol-dependent persons are strikingly
high. in this study, we limited the potential impact of smoking by
recruiting non- or light smokers and by limiting cigarette use
immediately before the pet scan. limitations of the study include
the small sample size, selection of alcohol-dependent subjects
with minimal withdrawal symptoms, and the single time point for
measurement of ␮-or binding during the fluctuating course of
early abstinence. finally, to date, the ocds has typically been
used as a repeated measure in pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy clinical trials; thus, subjects complete the ocds at
weekly intervals corresponding with study visits. we used the
ocds with modified instructions to score items based on time
since the last measurement and had subjects complete the ocds
instrument several times each day throughout their gcrc stay.
we elected to use the ocds to take advantage of the greater
precision in craving measurement afforded by this instrument
compared with an analog measure. it remains for future research
to clarify the effects of such frequent measurement periods on
the psychometric properties of the instrument; however, we
believe that the similarity in brain regions identified in our study
through correlation with the ocds and through alternative
craving measurement strategies in other studies lends support to
this application of the ocds measure.
in summary, these findings support an important role of the
endogenous opioid system in alcoholism. they are in line with
our previous research demonstrating differences in opioid activity in people with alcoholism or who are at high risk for
developing alcoholism. they also support the utility of pursuing
further development of opioid receptor antagonist medications
for the treatment of alcoholism.
