abstract: we have previously shown that hfsh-0 34-37 (ktct) and 49-52 (trdl) inhibit binding

of 1251-hfshto  xxxg815xxx  in calf testis membranes and that hfsh-0 33-53, which encompasses these
tetrapeptides, inhibits binding with increased potency. hfsh-0 33-53 rapidly dimerizes under conditions
utilized in the receptor binding assay (ph 7.5) so that the binding inhibition reported earlier was due to
the hfsh-0 33-53 dimer rather than the monomer. at p h 6.5, conversion to dimer does not occur, and
binding inhibition could be unequivocally attributed to the monomer. radioiodinated and alkylated hfsh-8
m. the biological activity of hfsh-p
33-53 binds to the  xxxg815xxx  with a kd = (5.5 f 1.4) x
33-53 was assessed by its ability to affect the conversion of androstenedione to estradiol in rat sertoli cells
cultures. fsh-/3 33-53 behaved as a partial antagonist of the fsh-induced estradiol synthesis. the required
incubation medium, however, contains cystine as well as cysteine, which rapidly forms a hfsh-0 cys(51)-s-s-cys derivative at the p h of the incubation, 7.4. when hfsh-0 33-53 was converted either to
the hfsh-0 cys(5 1)-s-s-cys or to a carboxymethylated derivative, inhibition of fsh-induced estradiol
synthesis still was observed. this result demonstrates that the free r-sh group at cys51 is not responsible
for the inhibition. fsh-0 33-53 also significantly stimulated basal levels of estradiol synthesis, but not
to maximal levels observed with fsh (partial agonist). neither the carbohydrate content of hfsh-0 nor
the cy subunit of fsh appears to be essential for signal transduction and expression of the hormone effect
of fsh-fi 33-53.

follitropin (fsh), a pituitary glycoprotein hormone composed of two nonidentical subunits, plays an important role
in ovulation in the female and spermatogenesis in the male.
in an earlier study (sluss et al., 1986), we reported inhibition
of 12%hfsh binding to testicular fsh receptors by synthetic
tetrapeptides corresponding to amino acids 34-37 (trdl)
and 49-52 (ktct) of the fi subunit of human follitropin
(fsh). a subsequent report (schneyer et al., 1988) concluded
that the interaction of fsh with its receptor may involve
multiple, discrete binding determinants, which included
hfsh-fi 34-37 (trdl). in a preliminary report (andersen
et al., 1987), we noted that a synthetic peptide encompassing
trdl and ktct, and representing hfsh-p 33-53 (h2nytrdlvy knparpkiqktctf-conh2) (pierce & parsons, 1981), also inhibited 1251-hfshbinding to receptor, at
a potency significantly greater than that seen with either individual tetrapeptide. the presence of cystine at position 51
caused us to suspect the observed effect might be due, in part
at least, to a dimer of the peptide. we report here the results

health.

of our studies on the receptor binding properties of monomer-dimer forms of hfsh-/3 33-53, and on the ability of each
form, as well as various cysteine-51 derivatives, to affect
steroidogenesis in cultured rat sertoli cells. our results suggest
hfsh-p 33-53 binds to the  xxxg815xxx  in a functional
manner, affecting both basal and fsh-stimulated steroidogenesis. they also imply that neither carbohydrate content
nor the fsh- xxxg220xxx  is absolutely essential for fsh signal
transduction.

experimental
procedures
materials. highly purified  xxxd2285xxx  (ler- 1781-2,
4000 iu/mg) was radioiodinated and used as the radioligand
in the radioreceptor assay. purified ovine fsh (ler-19966,
8 nih-fsh-si units/mg) was used in the sertoli cell culture
assay. iodoacetamide, cysteine, and dithiothreitol (dtt) were
obtained from sigma (st. louis, mo). all solvents and
buffers utilized in the chromatographic procedures were
hplc-grade reagents.
peptide synthesis, purification, and characterization. the
synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 33-53 of
hfsh-p subunit was prepared by dr. jean rivier, clayton
foundation laboratories for peptide biology, the salk institute, san diego, ca, under contract nol-hd-7-2907 from
the contraceptive development branch, center for population
0 1990 american chemical society

follitropin subunits
research, nichhd. synthesis was by the solid-phase method (merrifield, 1963) using the t-boc protection scheme.
the hfsh-8 33-53 peptide was purified by us utilizing
preparative reverse-phase liquid chromatography on octadecyl-silica (waters delta-pak c-18, 100-a pore diameter)
using a linear acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% tfa from 5% to
100% ch,cn, at 30 oc. homogeneity was verified by
analytical hplc. amino acid composition of the peptide was
determined using the waters pico-tag system (bidlingmeyer
et al., 1984) and was in accord with predicted values.
preparation of radiolabeled fsh. radiolabeled hfsh was
prepared as we described previously (schneyer et al., 1986).
this method involves  xxxg1338xxx -catalyzediodination of
highly purified  xxxd2285xxx . polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page) was utilized to purify the hormone following
radioiodination (schneyer et al., 1986). the resulting 1251hfsh had a specific activity of 25 pci/pg and a minimum
of 35% bindability to excess receptors.
radioligand receptor assay ( r r a ) . preparation of calf
testis membranes containing fsh receptors and the rra were
performed essentially as we described elsewhere (schneyer et
al., 1986) with the following modifications: 3 mg wet weight
of membrane preparation, 2.5 ng of radioligand, and samples
or buffer (hepes, 50 mm; sucrose, 250 mm; and mgc12,
5 mm, adjusted to ph 7.5 or 6.5 to a total volume of 0.25 ml)
were incubated for 18 h at 20 oc. after incubation, hormone
bound to membrane receptor was separated from unbound
hormone by centrifugation (30000g, 15 min). nonspecific
binding (nsb) was defined as radioligand bound in the
presence of  xxxd3426xxx -fold excess of unlabeled hfsh.
conversion of hfsh-0 33-53 dimer to monomer by reduction. the hfsh-@ 33-53 peptide contains a cysteine
residue at position 5 1, leading to rapid dimerization during
storage and under various experimental conditions as described
under results. in order to convert hfsh-0 33-53 dimer to
monomer, the dimer (1 5 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml of buffer
a (hepes, 50 mm; sucrose, 0.1 m; and mgc12, 5 mm, made
to ph 8.5 with triethylamine) and reduced in the presence of
a 100-fold molar excess of dithiothreitol (dtt) by incubation
for 30 min at 25 oc. conversion of dimer to monomer, which
was 100%under the conditions described, could be monitored
by taking advantage of their differential elution times upon
analytical reverse-phase hplc. the reduced peptide was
immediately subjected to hplc to remove excess dtt. the
resulting fractions were evaporated under a nitrogen stream,
extracted with ether (to remove any tfa remaining from
hplc), suspended in acetone, dried as before under nitrogen,
and stored at -20 oc until needed. under these conditions,
the reduced peptide remained stable as a monomer for several
days. alternatively, the reduced peptide was immediately
alkylated after reduction.
peptide alkylation with iodoacetamide. after reduction
with dtt as described above, the peptide was protected from
light and incubated for 30 min at 4 oc with a 2-fold molar
excess (relative to dtt) of iodoacetamide, followed by incubation for 4 h at 25 oc. the alkylated peptide was purified
by reverse-phase hplc, as described above.
preparation of radioiodinated synthetic peptides. the
procedure used for radioiodination of the synthetic peptides
was similar to that utilized for radioiodination of hfsh, with
the exception that a total of 100 pg of peptide was utilized
and the separation of free iodine from iodinated peptide was
performed by gel filtration through sephadex g-25. the
specific activity of the alkylated and radioiodinated peptide
was 13.4 pci/pg.

scatchard analysis of binding data. increasing amounts
of alkylated and radioiodinated synthetic hfsh-0 33-53 (from
25 to 125 pg) were incubated with membrane receptors (3 mg)
in a final volume of 0.5 ml (see rra procedure) at ph 6.5.
nonspecific binding was determined at each concentration
using excess intact hfsh. incubation was for 18 h at 20 oc,
after which the bound and unbound ligands were separated
by centrifugation at 30000g for 15 min. scatchard analysis
(scatchard, 1949) was done by using the ligand-pc program
version 3.0 (munson & rodbard, 1988).
cysteinyl derivative. ten milligrams of peptide was dissolved in buffer a, ph 6.5. a 2-fold molar excess of cysteine
and a 2-fold molar excess of cystine were added to the solution,
and the ph was adjusted to 7.5 with triethylamine. the
solution was stirred for 16 h at 25 oc. conversion of the
peptide to its cysteinyl derivative was monitored by taking
advantage of differential elution times upon reverse-phase
hplc. the derivative was purified by reverse-phase hplc
as indicated above.
measurement of forms of hfsh-0 33-53 under various
assay conditions. the stability of hfsh-0 33-53 under
conditions of rra and in vitro bioassay (see below) was
assessed by incubating the peptide (0.025 and 0.1 mm) in a
final volume of 2 ml of either rra or cell culture medium.
the incubation conditions were those utilized for the respective
assays, with aliquots removed at various times for assessment
of conversion to other forms through use of analytical reverse-phase hplc.
in vitro bioassay for fsh activity. assessment of fsh
agonist or antagonist activity was based on the ability of
peptides to affect either the basal or the hormone-stimulated
conversion of androstenedione to estradiol by cultures of sertoli
cells taken from immature rat testis. the method utilized was
essentially that described by us elsewhere (sluss et al., 1987),
slightly modified for multi-well plating (grasso & reichert,
1989). medium was changed 48 h after isolation of sertoli
cells and initial incubation. after an additional 24 h, ofsh
or test peptides were added to the cells, and incubation was
allowed to proceed for another 24 h. the final incubation
medium contained  xxxd2388xxx  (mix) (0.1 mm)
and androstenedione (0.04 mm) as substrate for aromatase.
measurement of estradiol was done by ria as previously
described (schneyer et al., 1986, 1988) with modifications
(grasso & reichert, 1989) using antiserum generously made
available by dr. gordon niswender, department of physiology
and biophysics, colorado state university, fort collins, co.

results
ph-related conversion of hfsh-0 33-53 from monomer
to dimer forms and inhibition of 12si-fshbinding. in initial
studies (andersen et al., 1987), we reported that hfsh-/3
33-53 inhibited binding of 12si-hfshto testis membrane
receptors with a potency considerably greater than observed
with the tetrapeptides hfsh-0 34-37. on the basis of elution
times from reverse-phase hplc (figure 1a-d), it appeared
that the purified hfsh-/3 33-53 was rapidly converted to
another form when incubated under conditions utilized for the
fsh rra. the latter is conducted by incubating peptide with
membrane receptor for 20 h at ph 7.5. because of the
presence of a free r-sh group in hfsh-p 33-53, at cys51,
it was presumed this conversion was to the corresponding
cystine dimer. reduction by dithiothreitol of the ph 7.5
generated component confirmed that this was the case. under
the conditions of the assay, there is, at ph 7.5, a rapid conversion of the monomer to dimer form (figure 2) that is
essentially complete after only a few minutes at a peptide

concentration of 0.1 mm, and more slowly at a more dilute
concentration of peptide (0.025 mm). the hfsh-p 33-53
monomer could be regenerated from the dimer form by reduction with dtt (figure 1a) and stabilized in the monomeric form by alkylation with iodoacetamide (figure 1d). it
seems clear, however, that i2,i-hfsh binding inhibition initially reported by us (andersen et al., 1987) was due to the

action of the peptide dimer. hfsh- xxxg278xxx -53 was stable in the
monomeric form at ph 6.5 (figure 2). the fsh rra assay
was performed at ph 6.5 instead of 7.5 to determine the effect
of the peptide monomer on izsi-hfshbinding. inhibition of
binding of 12,1-hfsh to membrane receptor by unlabeled
hfsh was similar between ph 6.5 and 7.5 (ecm = 80 ng/ml
at ph 6.5, ed50= 120 ng/ml at ph 7.5). inhibitions of
l2,i-hfsh binding to membrane receptor by hfsh-p 33-53
monomer (at ph 6.5) and dimer (at ph 7.5) were also comparable (ed,, = 0.7 mm and edso = 0.4 mm, respectively)
(figure 3a,b). thus, apparently both monomeric and dimeric
forms of fsh-p 33-53 are capable of inhibiting the specific
binding of fsh to its receptor, and with comparable potency.
presumably, the dimer is sufficiently small so that it may fit
into the hormone binding site on the membrane without
complications due to steric hindrance. another implication
of these observations is confirmation of the results obtained
with derivatives of hfsh-p-cys5 1, that the free sulfhydryl
group at cys51 is not responsible for the interaction of peptide
with receptor (because the dimer also inhibited the fsh
binding).
binding of hfsh-p 33-53 to fsh membrane receptor.
the interaction of hfsh-p 33-53 with receptors on calf testis
membranes was studied utilizing scatchard analysis
(scatchard, 1949). hfsh-p 33-53 was radioiodinated, and
binding to  xxxg815xxx  enriched membrane was measured
in the presence and absence of fsh. the usual procedure for
radioiodination is performed at ph 7.5. as shown previously
(vida supra), at this ph there is a rapid conversion of hfsh-p
33-53 to the dimer form, which iodinates poorly (figure 4).
to overcome this problem, hfsh-/3 33-53 was maintained in
the monomer form by carboxymethylation of cys51. the
carboxymethylated hfsh-p 33-53 iodinates readily (figure
4), and the iodinated derivative was separated from free 12,1
by sephadex g-25 gel filtration. scatchard analysis (figure
5), utilizing increasing amounts of radiolabeled peptide, indicated a single class of binding sites with a kd = (5.5 f 1.4)

scatchard plot of lzsi-hfsh-@
33-53 binding to calf testis
membrane: because of the low affinity of peptide for receptor, it was
necessary to add unlabeled peptide to the radioiodinated and alkylated
peptide (1.6 pg/ng of tracer) to create a favorable condition for
binding. nonspecific binding was determined at each concentration
(50-250 pg/ml) using excess of intact hfsh. the binding affinity
(mean f standard error, n = 2)
constant [ k d = (5.5 f 1.4) x
was calculated by using the program ligand version 3.0 (munson
& rodbard, 1988).
figure 5:

x lo-’ m. we have developed evidence earlier (schneyer et
al., 1988) for the presence of multiple points of interaction
between hormone and receptor, so that the decreased affinity
of hfsh-/3 33-53 compared with the intact fsh molecule (&
=
m) was not unexpected. a similar value of kd has
been estimated for synthetic hcg peptides (keutmann et al.,
1988).
effect of hfsh-/3 33-53 on estradiol synthesis in cultured
rat sertoli cells. we next examined the effect of hf.9h-p
33-53 on the conversion of androstenedione to estradiol in
cultures of sertoli cells taken from testis of immature rats.
the effect of increasing concentrations of ovine fsh on estradiol synthesis in this system is shown in figure 6 . a
maximum response was obtained with 20 ng/ml ofsh, and
the response to io ng/ml fsh was consistently submaximal.
hfsh-/3 33-53, at 40 pm, significantly (ji < 0.01, student’s
t test) inhibited the response to 10 ng of ofsh (figure 7).
higher concentrations of peptide (80 pm) did not further
decrease the effect of fsh. this suggested that the peptide
may be functioning as a partial agonist of fsh action, possibly
by occupying fsh binding sites, but stimulating less than
optimal hormone signal transduction. to examine this point
further, we studied the effect of fsh-p 33-53 on the basal
secretion of estradiol in the cultured rat sertoli cell system.

effect of hfsh-8 33-53 on estradiol biosynthesis: the
biosynthesis of estradiol by cultured rat sertoli cells, in the absence
(filled bars) or presence (open bars) of ofsh (io mg/ml), at different
peptide concentrations is shown (mean f se, n = 3). the peptide
was able to stimulate estradiol biosynthesis up to 40% of the maximal
response. at higher doses (40-80 pm), the peptide was a partial
antagonist of fsh. similar results were obtained with the alkylated
hfsh-8 33-53 peptide.
figure 7:

as can be seen (figure 7), hfsh-/3 33-53 significantly stimulated basal levels of estradiol synthesis, with a maximal
stimulation seen at about 80 pm. this agonist effect on basal
levels of estradiol synthesis probably explains why the peptide
cannot further diminish fsh-stimulated estradiol biosynthesis
at concentrations in excess of 40 pm. it appears, therefore,
that hfsh-/3 33-53 functions as a partial agonist with respect
to basal estradiol levels, and as a partial antagonist of fshstimulated estradiol biosynthesis in the cultured sertoli cell
system. the ability of the peptide to affect signal transduction
and promote steroidogenesis in vitro is also noteworthy in view
of the apparent absence of an absolute requirement for the
carbohydrate components present in the /3 subunit to achieve
this effect.
role of cys.51 of hfsh-p 33-53 in inhibition of fshstimulated estradiol biosynthesis. the binding of fsh to
its receptor is inhibited by treatment of membranes with reducing agents such as dtt (reichert & abou-issa, 1976).
therefore, the presence of a free r-sh group at position 5 1
in the hfsh-p 33-53 peptide might lead to nonspecific binding
inhibition through reduction of the  xxxg815xxx  on cultured
sertoli cells. in addition, the medium required for sertoli cell
culture (dmem-f12) contains cysteine and cystine (0.1 mm
each) so that formation of an hfsh-/3 cys(5l)-s-s-cys
derivative seemed likely. we prepared the latter derivative
of hfsh-p 33-53 and determined conditions for its identification, using reverse-phase hplc. this procedure was also
utilized to monitor the forms of hfsh-8 33-53 generated

under the conditions of sertoli cell culture. as can be seen

monomer to dimer as well as a rapid formation of the hfsh-j3
cys(5i)-s-s-cys derivative, so that at the end of incubation,
the latter is the predominant species present (about 80%),
along with a small amount (about 20%) of peptide dimer.
although incubation of hfsh-j3 33-53 with the culture
medium of sertoli cells (dmem-f12) resulted in a mixture
of forms, the peptide, at an initial concentration of 0.1 mm,
inhibited fsh (20 ng/ml) stimulation of estradiol synthesis
(figure 9). when, hfsh-@33-53 was allowed to dimerize
at ph 7.5 prior to addition to the assay system, the preformed
dimer also inhibited fsh stimulation of steroidogenesis
(figure 9). similar results were obtained when hfsh-j3
cys(5 1)-s-s-cys (formed by incubation with cysteine) was
tested (figure 9). under these circumstances, it was not
possible to assign the steroidogenic nor the inhibitiory activity
to any particular species (monomer, dimer, or cysteinylated
monomer). however, due to the irreversibility of the alkylation, the carboxymethylated peptide cannot form peptide
dimer or cysteinyl derivative in the culture medium. hfsh-j3
cys(5 i)-s-ch2-conh2 (formed by alkylation with iodoacetamide) inhibited the estradiol biosynthesis (figure 9). in
addition, the effects on basal or fsh-stimulated estradiol

biosynthesis, obtained when utilizing the alkylated peptide
(data not shown), were similar to those obtained with the
underivatized peptide (figure 7). these results suggest that
the free sulfhydryl group is not involved in the activity of
hfsh-p 33-53.
since the various cys51 derivatives lacking a free sulfhydryl
group inhibited the estradiol response, it seems clear that the
free sulfhydryl group at cys51 in the hfsh-j3 33-53 peptide
is not required for receptor binding inhibition and that the
peptide does not inhibit the fsh response through nonspecific
reduction of receptor disulfide bonds. these findings are
consistent with the absence of free sulfhydryl groups in the
intact glycoprotein hormones (ryan et al., 1987).

discussion
the j3 subunits of the gonadotropic hormones share regions
of primary structure that are highly conserved. since fsh,
lh, tsh, and hcg also have a common  xxxg220xxx , it seems
likely that the regions on the /3 subunit sharing highest sequence homology are those involved in binding to the  xxxg220xxx . the regions with lowest homology or highest sequence
variability would include receptor binding regions (pierce &
parsons, 1981). by analysis of aligned sequences, it is possible
to identify several regions of the j3 subunit that could be involved in interaction with the  xxxg220xxx . these regions include
hfsh-/3 12-32, 52-67, 76-79, or 76-87. neither the nterminal nor the c-terminal regions are thought to play an
important role in the interaction between subunits, or between
hormone and receptor (ryan et al., 1988). as a result, using
the subtractive approach, there appear three likely receptor
binding regions in the hfsh-j3 subunit. these are sequences
33-51, 68-75, and a region near the c-terminus, possibly
87-94.
ward and moore (1979) have postulated that the hcg j3
subunit region 93-100 may be the determinant of hormone
specificity among the glycoprotein hormones and designated
this region the "determinant loop". this determinant loop
concept has proved useful in attempts to understand details
of the interaction of the glycoprotein hormones and receptors.
recently, keutmann et al. (1989) reported that a synthetic
peptide corresponding to this region inhibited hcg binding
to receptor but did not stimulate testosterone production in
cultured rat leydig cells. keutman et al. (1987) found that
synthetic peptides corresponding to 38-57 of the hcg+
subunit (comparable to hfsh-j3 32-5 1) inhibited hcg binding
to receptor, and also stimulated testosterone production in
leydig cell cultures. these results suggest that multiple receptor binding sites exist on hcg and that all receptor binding
sites on hcg are not functionally associated with postbinding
events.
we have recently identified a putative receptor binding site
on the hfsh-j3 subunit, hfsh-j3 34-37, and suggested that
multiple receptor binding sites may also exist on hfsh
(schneyer et al., 1988). because of the complex heterodimeric
glycoprotein structure of fsh, such a prediction would not
seem unreasonable. one would not expect, therefore, that a
small peptide region as represented by hfsh-j3 33-53 could
possess all of the structural and binding characteristics required
for a quantitative expression of the hormone effect as elicited
by the hfsh a/@ hologlycohormone.
a two-dimensional graphic representation of secondary
structure predictions (chou & fasman, 1978) for hfsh-j3
33-53 is shown in figure 10a-d. in addition to structural
features, the graphics indicate zones of maximum hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity (figure 10a) and the probability
for surface exposure of amino acids (figure 10b) as well as

figureio: secondary structure analysis of hfsh-8 33-53: the
analysis has been done by using the  xxxg873xxx  program (devereux et al.,
1984). the figure includes chou and fasman analysis of secondary
structure (wavy lines 8 sheets and straight lines random coil) together
with hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity (a), surface probability (b),
flexibility (c), and antigenic index (d). no a helix was predicted.
the peptide seems to be random coil oriented and highly flexible in
the center, with 8-sheet structure at the extremes. the high surface
probability and antigenic index predict that the peptide should be
surface-oriented and highly antigenic.

maximum flexibility (figure 1oc) and likely antigenicity
(figure 10d). from such an analysis, it is possible to anticipate that hfsh-j3 33-53 is a highly unstructured and flexible
peptide that is exposed on the surface of fsh and may represent, therefore, an antigenic determinant of the hormone.
we have previously reported a component of the exposed
region, hfsh-j3 34-37 (trdl), to represent an antigenic
determinant of fsh (blocks interaction between fsh and a
hormone-specific polyclonal antibody) and proposed it to
represent an  xxxg815xxx  binding region of the hfsh /3
subunit (schneyer et al., 1988).
the high flexibility and absence of structure predicted for
hfsh-j3 33-53 by the chou and fasman analysis suggest that
the peptide is capable of adopting numerous conformations
in solution (wright et al., 1988). the ability of this peptide
to inhibit binding of fsh to membrane receptor with homogeneous (parallel) binding inhibition isotherms indicates that
hfsh-j3 33-53., as well as its dimer form and various derivatives, is capable of assuming a conformation compatible with
a productive receptor interaction. the low affinity constant
for binding of radioiodinated peptide to membrane receptor
m)
as determined by scatchard analysis (kd = 5.5 x
compared to that of the hfsh a ! / p holohormone (& =
m) is not surprising if multiple binding sites and the possibility
of several peptide conformers in solution are considered. in
addition, because the carboxymethylated peptide also inhibits
the estradiol response, the inhibition can be attributed to the

peptide itself and not to the reductive properties of the sulfhydryl group at cys51. the binding of the radioiodinated
peptide provides the first direct evidence for the interaction
of a segment of the hfsh-j3 subunit with the  xxxg815xxx .
the hfsh-/3 33-53 peptide, in addition to functioning as
a binding antagonist, stimulated estradiol synthesis in cultured
rat sertoli cells. maximum stimulation obtained with the
peptide was about 50% of maximal fsh stimulation, and the
peptide also inhibited the steroid response generated by fsh.
thus, in addition to functioning as a binding antagonist,
hfsh-j3 also functions as a partial agonist of fsh action. the
steroidogenic effect of the synthetic peptide also indicates that
although the a! subunit and the carbohydrate structure of
fsh-j3 are required for complete expression of hormone action
and quantitatively maximal steroidogenic effects, they are not
absolutely required for effective signal transduction. the
effectiveness of small peptides to interact with the  xxxg815xxx  with expression of antagonist/partial agonist effects
suggests that analogues of hfsh-j3 33-53, as well as of other
receptor binding regions as they are identified, may lead to
generation of derivatives with properties of potential usefulness
in understanding and controlling reproductive processes.

abstract: the reversed-phase chromatography technique was employed in the measurement of d n a

synthesis at the primers d(pt),, r(pu),, d(pa),, and r(pa), (n = 1-16) in the presence of template poly(da)

or poly(dt). d n a synthesis was catalyzed by escherichia coli d n a polymerase i klenow fragment,
physarum polycephalum dna polymerase 8-like, p . polycephalum dna polymerase a, and human placenta
d n a polymerase a. values of k, and v,,, were measured as functions of the primer chain lengths. it
was found that all mononucleotides and small oligonucleotides served as primers of d n a synthesis. values
of the logarithm of both k, and v,,, increased linearly until primers had attained a chain length of 9-12
nucleotides, where a break was observed. the incremental as well as the absolute values of k, were interpreted
in terms of free binding energies. these together with other data indicate that the 3’-ultimate nucleotide
of the primer contributes a decisive amount of free energy of binding to d n a polymerase both from the
nucleoside and from the phosphate moiety. the incremental increase is due to a complementary interaction
between bases of primer and template buried in the binding cleft of the polymerase. it is also the ultimate
nucleotide that determines whether the ribonucleotide or the deoxyribonucleotide is an efficient primer.
it is of interest that the major results seem preserved for all four d n a polymerases. an energetic model
for the binding of the template-primer was proposed and compared with available crystallographic data.

d n a polymerases catalyze the elongation of oligo- or polynucleotides at their 3’-terminus by covalent addition of nucleoside 5’-monophosphates from the triphosphates complementary to the base-pairing polynucleotide template strand
(kornberg, 1980). the length of these nucleotides serving as
primers of dna polymerization and their ribose or deoxyribose nature determine the success at which elongation occurs.
the types of dna polymerases that function in chromosome
replication easily use rna as primers while dna repairing
polymerases strongly prefer dna. the length can be imagined to be associated with the number of noncovalent complementary interactions with a given template and probably
with the polymerase binding cleft and thus with the efficiency
holding the 3’-terminus in the position that is optimal for the
catalytic addition of mononucleotides. this efficiency has been
measured previously in experiments employing synthetic hook
polymers (fisher & korn, 1979) and small primers with
natural templates (grosse & krauss, 1984). the success of
priming has been examined after routine acid precipitation
of product dna, usually after extensive primer elongation.
the minimal number of nucleotides in these primers has been

suggested to be three to five and four, respectively.
the crystal structure has been elucidated for escherichia
coli dna polymerase i klenow fragment (ollis et al., 1985;
joyce & steitz, 1987). from the structural coordinates as well
as from model fitting, the binding site for dna has been
localized and also a site that binds nucleoside 5’-monophosphates. this site is very likely to be involved in the 3 ’ 4 ’
exonuclease (proofreading activity; kornberg, 1980) located
on a small structural domain while the activity to synthesize
dna resides on the large domain of klenow fragment
(freemont et al., 1986). the exact location of the primer
3’-terminus and of nucleoside 5’-triphosphates has remained
mainly unsolved.
we have investigated the structure-function relation of
synthetic ribo and deoxyribo primers for four representative
dna polymerases employing michaelis-menten kinetic
analysis and measurement of products by reversed-phase
chromatography. we find that all these polymerases catalyze
dna synthesis in the presence of primers as short as nucleoside 5’-monophosphates. from the results of a systematic
structure-energy investigation, we have developed an energetic
model of the template-primer binding site of dna polymerases.
