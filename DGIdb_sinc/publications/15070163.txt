summary
salix extracts are in current use for the treatment of pain and inflammation. in order to obtain an
insight into the mechanism(s) of action of the ethanolic salix extract 1520l – which is essentially
similar to an extract for which clinical studies have demonstrated analgesic effectiveness – its effects were evaluated in an established in vitro assay test system using primary human monocytes.
the ic50-values obtained for the inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced release of
 xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) reflecting cyclooxygenase (cox)-2-mediated pge2 release were 47 µg/ml
and 0.6 µg/ml, for the salix extract 1520l and rofecoxib-like research compound l745337, respectively. there was no effect on cox-1 and cox-2 activity. the salix extract inhibited the lps-induced release of  xxxg2296xxx , interleukin-1beta and interleukin-6 with ic50-values of
180.0, 33.0 and 86.0 µg/ml, respectively. both, salicin and salicylate, had no effect in any of the parameters. our results indicate that salix extract 1520l inhibits cox-2-mediated pge2 release
through compounds other than salicin or salicylate. our data further suggest that the proprietary
salix extract is a weak inhibitor of proinflammatory cytokines.

 introduction
herbal medicinal products such as various formulations from the bark of salix species are well recognised
throughout europe for treating inflammatory conditions and pains of different origin (escop, 1997).
clinical studies have revealed that a proprietary salix
bark extract was superior to placebo (chrubasik et al.
2000; schmid et al. 2000) and not inferior (chrubasik
et al. 2001a; chrubasik et al. 2001b) to conventional
treatment including the well known synthetic cox2inhibitory drug rofecoxib (brooks et al. 1999). previous in vitro studies have indicated that the anti-inflammatory activities of salix extracts and its compounds
are manifested via inhibitory actions on biochemical

pathways of  xxxd208xxx  (wurm et al. 1982), the
enzymatic action of hyaluronidase (kuppusamy et al.
1990) and the generation of oxygen radicals (rohnert
et al. 1998), an overall effect being based on the additive effects of flavonoids, tannins, salicylalcohol
derivatives and other still unknown compounds
(williamson, 2001). the present study was conducted
to aquire additional information on the in vitro anti-inflammatory effects of the ethanolic salix extract
1520l, which is essentially similar to an extract marketed as assalixr for which clinical studies have
demonstrated relevant effect sizes (chrubasik et al.
2000; chrubasik et al. 2001b).

 methods
the in vitro anti-inflammatory effects of the ethanolic
salix extract 1520l (drug extract ratio 8–14 : 1, solvent
ethanol 70%, hplc fingerprint fig. 1) were evaluated
as described previously (fiebich et al. 2001). briefly,
primary human monocytes (cd14/cd36 positive peripheral mononuclear cells) were prepared from buffy
coats from healthy blood donors and were isolated by
using the  xxxd3253xxx -gradient isolation method. cells were
then seeded in 24-well plates (falcon) and were allowed to attach for 1 h. after 2 washing steps fresh
medium (low-endotoxin rpmi1640 (gibco)) containing 1% human serum was added and the cells incubated at 37 °c/5% co2. extract 1520l (plantina gmbh,
munich, germany), compound l745337 with similar
cox-2 inhibiting properties as rofecoxib (kindly provided by böhringer-ingelheim, biberach, germany),
salicin and salicylate (both from sigma, deisenhofen,
germany) were dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx 

fig. 1. extraction. extract 1520 l (400 mg) was extracted
with 4 ml ethanol 70% (v/v) in ultrasound, filtered and twice
washed with 3 ml ethanol 70% and refilled to a total volume
of 10 ml. the insoluble part was removed. the soluble part
was used for the fingerprint hplc.
hplc: injection: 1 µl; detection: lambda = 280, 220 and 215 nm;
mobile phase: acetonitril + 1% 0.1 n orthophosphoric acid
and water +1% 0.1 n orthophosphoric acid; column: lichrocart®125-4 with lichrospher® 100 rp 18 (5 µ), merck;
precolumn: lichrocart®4-4 with lichrospher® 100 rp 18
(5 µ), merck; flow: 1 ml/min; gradient: 10–30% acetonitril in
20 min (linear).

(dmso) and serially diluted to produce concentrations
ranging from 10–500 µg/ml (salix extract) and
10–9–10–6 m (l745337), 0.3 µm–3 mm (salicin, corresponding to 0.1–1000 µg/ml) and 10–7 m to 10–4 m
(salicylate).
for the analysis of cox-2 mediated prostaglandin
e2 (pge2) release, monocytes were pre-incubated with
the salix extract or the other compounds for 30 min.
thereafter, cells were treated with escherichia coli
lipopolysaccharide (e. coli lps, 1 ng/ml; sigma) for
24 h to induce cox-2 expression and protein synthesis
and subsequent release of pge2. supernatants were
then used for determination of cox-2-mediated pge2concentrations.
to analyse cox-2 activity, cells were treated with
lps (1 ng/ml) for 24 h to allow the de novo-synthesis
of cox-2 protein. medium was then removed and
cells washed in serum-free medium. salix extract,
l745337, salicin and salicylate, all in the concentrations mentioned above were added and after 15 min
 xxxd208xxx  (15 µm) was supplemented for another 15 min. supernatants were then used for determination of pge2.
to analyse basal cox-1 activity in untreated cells,
medium was removed and cells were washed in serumfree medium. extract 1520l, l745337, salicin and salicylate were preincubated for 30 min in the concentrations described above and after 15 min of incubation,
15 µm  xxxd208xxx  was added for another 15 min.
supernatants were then used for determination of
cox-1 mediated pge2-concentrations.
pge2 in supernatants was determined by eia (assaydesign, distributed by biotrend, köln, sensitivity
36 pg/ml) and the cytokines by using elisa (pelikine,
pelikine, distributed by hiss, freiburg, sensitivities of
il-6,  xxxg2296xxx ,  xxxg1170xxx  10 pg/ml). all experiments were
carried out with at least two buffy coats from different
blood donors in triplicates.
statistical analysis was conducted by the institut für
biochemische analysen und methodenentwicklung
gbr, freiburg (germany). the original data obtained
were converted to percentage values relative to the lps
controls and their means calculated with s.e. the ic50
values (µg/ml) were calculated using computerised
non-linear regression analysis with 95% confidential
intervals. in the figures, a regression curve was adjusted to the calculated mean values.

 results
the effects of salix extract, salicin and salicylate on
stimulated release of il-6, il-1 and cox-2-mediated
pge2 are summarised in table 1, the regression curves
adjusted to the calculated mean values are illustrated in
fig. 2a–d.

fig. 2. effect of salix extract on lps-induced release of
pge2 (1a), il-6 (1b),  xxxg2296xxx , (1c) and  xxxg1170xxx  (1d) in primary
human monocytes.
primary human monocytes were pre-incubated with the extract at the indicated concentrations for 30 min and subsequently treated with lps (1 ng/ml) for 24 h. cytokines and
pge2 in the supernatants were measured by an enzyme immunoassay as described in materials and methods. data are
expressed as mean ± se of lps control.

salix extracts have demonstrated analgesic, antiphlogistic and antipyretic effects in various animal models
(escop, 1997; leslie, 1978; loniewski et al. 2002).
for example, dose-dependent effects have been reported in the hot-plate and carrageenan-induced paw
edema tests in rats (established test procedures to
demonstrate analgesic and ani-inflammatory effects,
respectively) for a salix extract containing 12% salicin
(loniewski et al. 2002). our results suggest that a
pge2-inhibiting effect is involved in the anti-inflammatory action of salix extract 1520l. compared to
l745337, the concentration to produce a 50% inhibition of cox-2 mediated pge2 release was about two
orders of magnitude higher with extract 1520l. this
corresponds to the difference in the daily dosages of
the proprietary salix extract assalixr (about 1600 mg)
and rofecoxib (12.5 mg) for the treatment of osteoarthritic pain. neither the extract, nor the prodrug
salicin or salicylate generated from the metabolism of
salicin had an impact on the cox enzyme activities.
this further supports previous findings of the lack of a
direct effect of salicylate on cox-1 and cox-2 activities in peripheral cells (giuliano and warner, 1998).
we therefore suggest that the salix extract exerts its action upstream of cox-2, for example by inhibiting
 xxxg1759xxx  (pla2), which generates  xxxd208xxx , the substrate of cox. such inhibition on the release of pge2 at the cox-2 substrate level has recently

been reported by xu et al. (2002). neither salicin nor
salicylate inhibited cox-2-mediated pge2 or cytokine
release (not shown). it remains to be established which
compound(s) inhibit the cox-2-mediated pge2 release and which target in the signal transduction pathway leading to cox-2 may be involved, i.e. nuclear
factor-kappab or mitogen-activated protein kinases
(mapks) (fiebich et al. 2000).
unlike the classical nsaids, extract 1520l inhibited lps-induced  xxxg1170xxx  and il-6 release from primary
human monocytes (fig. 2b–d). the weaker effect of
the salix extract on the release of pge2 compared to rofecoxib-like research compound l745337 may be outweighed by the fact that the extract inhibits also the release of other inflammatory mediators, e.g. cytokines.
since excellent analgesia was achieved with the proprietary extract assalixr in clinical studies (chrubasik et
al. 2000; 2001a,b; schmid et al. 2000), the interaction
(additive or synergistic anti-inflammatory) between
pge2 and cytokines (most likely  xxxg1170xxx ), needs to be
elucidated. due to the  xxxg1170xxx  regulatory role in the
biosynthesis of matrix proteins, salix extract may exert
a possible cartilage preventive effect (goldring, 1999).
further studies are therefore necessary to prove the
clinical relevance of the weak cytokine inhibitory effect and in vitro/in vivo conformity, and also to evaluate the potential long-term benefit of salix extracts.
