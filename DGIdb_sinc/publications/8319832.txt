summary

we have recently identified a region, n-terminus residues 9-30, in the extracellular domain of the follicle-stimulating hormone ( xxxd3477xxx ) receptor capable of binding  xxxd3477xxx , but not  xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2520xxx  (lh) or thyroid-stimulating
hormone ( xxxd3477xxx ) (dattatreyamurty
and reichert (1992) mol. cell. endocrinol. 87, 9-17). the objectives of the
present study were to examine the interaction between a synthetic peptide corresponding to this receptor sequence
and the p-subunit of  xxxd3477xxx , and to identify which  xxxd3477xxx -/? regions are involved in the interaction.  xxxd3477xxx -p subunit and
synthetic  xxxd3477xxx -p peptides 1-15, 71-85 and 101-111 effectively bound ‘251-labeled  xxxd3477xxx  ret-(9-30) peptide, and
binding was inhibited by excess unlabeled  xxxd3477xxx  receptors. scatchard analysis indicated that the synthetic  xxxd3477xxx -p
peptides had affinities for  xxxd3477xxx  ret-(9-30) peptide in the order of lo6 m-’ (k,), with the sum of individual peptide
affinities (k, = 1.21 x 10’ m-‘) closely approximating that of the intact p-subunit (1.02 x 10’ m-‘1. polyclonal
antibodies raised against  xxxd3477xxx  ret-(9-30) peptide completely inhibited the binding of 1251-labeled receptor peptide
to hfsh, hfsh-0, and hfsh+ peptides l-15, 71-85 and 101-111. our results indicate that recognition of  xxxd3477xxx -@
by n-terminus region (9-30) of the  xxxg815xxx  involves contact with residues in three discontinuous binding
regions on  xxxd3477xxx -p. the latter finding suggests that these three discontinuous sequence regions of  xxxd3477xxx -p may be
closely oriented on the hormone surface to form a contiguous region in the three-dimensional structure required for
recognition by the n-terminus region (residues 9-30) of the  xxxg815xxx .

introduction

follitropin (follicle-stimulating hormone,  xxxd3477xxx ) produced by the anterior pituitary gland belongs to a
family of closely related glycoprotein hormones that
includes lutropin ( xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2520xxx , lh),  xxxd3368xxx  (thyroid-stimulating
hormone, tsh) and
 xxxd2228xxx  (cg). these hormones are heterodimeric in nature, consisting of a common a-subunit in non-covalent association with a hormonespecific /?-subunit (pierce and parsons, 1981). follitropin plays a critical role in regulating gonadal functions. the actions of follitropin are mediated by specific membrane-bound
receptors that are coupled to

gtp-binding sites on g, protein (dattatreyamurty et
al., 1987; zhang et al., 1988), resulting in activation of
adenylate cyclase (heindel et al., 1975; zhang et al.,
1991). it appears that each subunit of  xxxd3477xxx  is involved
in receptor binding and stimulation, in vitro, of target
cell steroidogenesis (erickson et al., 1990; reichert et
al., 1991). earlier studies from this laboratory (santacoloma and reichert, 1990; santa-coloma et al., 19901,
using a synthetic peptide approach, have shown that
the p-subunit of  xxxd3477xxx  contains multiple receptor-binding regions. although peptides corresponding to these
binding regions show lower individual binding affinities
than  xxxd3477xxx -/3, together they have been postulated to
orient spatially to form contiguous domain(s) in the
three-dimensional structure of  xxxd3477xxx  leading to productive interaction with the receptor (reichert et al., 1991;
santa-coloma et al., 1991; keutmann, 1992).

described (dattatreyamurty et al., 1990, 1992). recent
cloning studies using molecular probes derived from
selected coding regions of the  xxxg1325xxx  cdna have
provided info~ation
about the primary structure of
rat  xxxg815xxx  (sprengel et al., 1990). the deduced
primary structure of the  xxxg815xxx  has several
important features in common with other glycoprotein
hormone receptors (salesse et al., 1991). the receptor
has a relatively large extracellular hydrophilic nterminus domain suggested to be involved in hormone-receptor
interaction (braun et al., 1991). recently, we identified a sequence, residues 9-30, in the
extracellular domain of the  xxxg815xxx  having no
homology with lh or tsh receptors (fig. 1) and
demonstrated that this region was capable of binding
to  xxxd3477xxx , but not to lh and tsh (dattatreyamurty and
reichert, 1992). in the present study, we tested 11
overlapping synthetic peptides corresponding to the
primary structure of hfsh+ (fig. 2) to identify which
 xxxd3477xxx $ regions are involved in interaction with the
n-terminus extracellular region represented by residues
9-30 of the  xxxg815xxx . our results suggest that the
n-terminus region (residues 9-30) of the  xxxg815xxx 
specifically interacts with three discontinuous receptorbinding regions of  xxxd3477xxx -/3 which may form a contiguous domain in three-dimensional structure for recognition by the n-terminus (9-30) region of the  xxxd3477xxx 
receptor.

bovine calf testes were obtained from a local abattoir and kept at -20°c until used for plasma membrane preparation.  xxxg1338xxx ,
ovalbumin, and
ribonuclease-a were purchased from sigma chemical
company, st. louis, mo, usa. sephadex g-2.5 and
ultragel aca 34 were from pharmacia-lo,
piscataway, nj, usa. pvdf membranes (immobilon-p) were
purchased from millipore, bedford, ma, usa. na”‘i
(carrier-free) was obtained from dupont-new england
nuclear, north billerica, ma, usa.
solubilized  xxxg815xxx  was prepared from calf
testes plasma membranes as described previously (dattatreyamurty et al., 1986, 1990).
peptide synthesis
a 23-mer peptide amide (fig. 1a, in bold letters)
corresponding to residues 9-30 in the n-terminus of
rat  xxxg815xxx  sequence (sprengel et al., 1990) was
synthesized and kindly provided by dr. jean river,
clayton foundation laboratories for peptide biology,
the saik institute, san diego, ca, usa, under contract no. l-hd-t-2907 from the contraceptive development branch, center for population research,
nichhd. the c-terminal tyrosine amide residue is
not part of the selected sequence in rat  xxxg815xxx 
but was included to allow radio-iodination of the peptide. synthetic peptide amides corresponding to 11
overlapping regions (fig. 2) in the primary amino acid
sequence of hfsh ~-subunit (watkins et al., 1987;
shome et al., 1988) were prepared by multiple peptide
systems (san diego, ca, usa) utilizing the solid-phase
method (merrifield, 1963) and the tertbutoxycarbonyl
protection scheme. the peptide amides were purified
by preparative reverse-phase liquid chromatography on
octa-decyl-$lica (water delta-pak c1s, milford, ma,
usa; 100 a pore diameter) using a linear acetonitrile
gradient (5-100%) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 30°c.
homogeneity of the peptide was checked by analytical
high-performance
liquid chromatography
(hplc).

reduction and s-acetamidomethylation
peptide amide

to verify the

of  xxxg815xxx 

the receptor-(9-30) peptide amide contains a cysteine residue at position 15. to prevent formation of a
peptide dimer, the receptor peptide amide was reduced and alkylated as previously described (dattatreyamurty and reichert, 1992). the alkylated peptide was purified by gel filtration through sephadex
g-25.
preparation of radio-iodinated receptor peptide amide

the alkylated receptor peptide amide (100 pg) was
radio-iodinated with carrier-free 2.5 mci of na”‘i as
described previously (dattatreyamurty
and reichert,
1992) using the  xxxg1338xxx  method (miyachi et al.,
1972) with some modifications (dattatreyamurty et al.,
1986). we separated radio-iodinated peptide from free
iodide by gel filtration through a column of sephadex
g-25. the column was eluted with 50 mm phosphate
buffer, ph 7.5, and 1 ml fractions were collected into
tubes containing 1 ml of 0.1% ovalbumin. the specific
activity of the alkylated and radio-iodinated receptor
peptide amide was 24-27 &i/pg.
binding studies

(1) experiments to examine the binding of lz51labeled ret-(9-30) peptide amide to hfsh, hfsh-p
and synthetic peptides of hfsh-p were carried out at
least 4 times under standard assay conditions as previously described (dattatreyamurty and reichert, 1992).
10 pg of hfsh-/3, synthetic peptide amides of hfsh+?
(fig. 2), hfsh (which serves as positive control), unrelated proteins such as ovalbumin and ribonuclease-a,
or unrelated synthetic 15-mer peptide amide (which
serve as negative controls) were each dissolved in 10 ~1
of 25 mm tris-hcl buffer, ph 7.0, and immobilized on
pvdf membranes (immobilon-p) by using a slot-blot
apparatus (vacuslot-vs). the sample-containing membranes were incubated for 14 h at 4°c in 20 mm hepes
buffer, ph 7.4, containing 3% ovalbumin to block
excess protein binding sites on the membrane. the
blocking buffer was then replaced with 20 mm hepes
buffer, ph 7.4, containing 0.5% ovalbumin and 10 mm
mgcl,, and the membrane samples were again incubated with 1251-labeled  xxxd3477xxx  ret-(9-30)
(730,000
cpm/ml) in the presence or absence of excess solubilized  xxxg815xxx  for 18 h, with slow shaking, at room
temperature. finally, the membranes were washed 3
times with 25 mm hepes buffer, ph 7.4, containing 5
mm mgci,, air dried and allowed to develop (autoradiography) overnight. the autoradiograms were then
subjected to densitometric scanning as described below.

(2) the quantitative binding of 1251-labeled  xxxd3477xxx 
ret-(9-30) to hfsh p-subunit or various synthetic peptides was determined through use of a solid-phase
assay technique (sternberg and nygren, 1988) as previously adapted to our studies (santa-coloma
and
reichert, 1991). filtration plates of 96 wells, containing surfactant-free cellulose ester membranes (millititer ha, millipore, bedford, ma, usa) were used as
solid support for hormone subunit or peptides. the
wells were prewetted with 25 mm tris-hci buffer, ph
7.4 ( xxxd3449xxx ). 10 pg of unlabeled hormone subunit
or synthetic peptide amides were dissolved in 10 ~1 of
tris-hci buffer, ph 7.4, and each sample (in triplicate)
was added to the wells. after incubation for 30 min at
room temperature, the wells were again incubated for
14 h at 4°c with  xxxd3449xxx  containing 2% ovalbumin
to block excess protein binding sites on the membrane.
the blocking buffer was then removed by vacuum
filtration, and the wells containing the samples were
further incubated with assay buffer (20 mm hepes
buffer, ph 7.4, 0.5% albumin and 10 mm mgcl,)
containing increasing concentrations
of 1251-labeled
 xxxd3477xxx  ret-(9-30) in the presence or absence of excess
solubilized  xxxg815xxx  for 21 h at 4°c and then 1 h
at room temperature with slow shaking to reach equilibrium. for separation of bound ‘251-labeled  xxxd3477xxx  rec(9-30) from free peptide, we utilized a method of rapid
filtration with vacuum. the wells were washed 3 times
with 25 mm hepes buffer, ph 7.4, containing 5 mm
mgcl,, air dried and punched to collect the membranes which were counted in an autogamma counter.
the affinity constant, k,, was determined from specific binding data using the ligand program (munson and rodbard, 1980). the criteria used for distinguishing between single and two-site models were as
indicated in the ligand program.
(3) the specificity of the binding of 1251-labeled
 xxxd3477xxx  ret-(9-30) peptide to hfsh+? and related synthetic peptides was confirmed by inhibition studies
using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the
synthetic  xxxd3477xxx  ret-(9-30) peptide amide. lxi-labeled
 xxxd3477xxx  ret-(9-30) peptide (- 14 x lo6 cpm in 170 ~1 of
0.05 m phosphate-buffered
saline (pbs)/o.l% ovalbumin) was pre-incubated with 375 ~1 of rabbit antiserum
to receptor peptide for 2 h at room temperature, and
then overnight at 4°c. the incubation mixture was
passed through a column of ultrogel aca 34 previously equilibrated and washed with pbs/ovalbumin to
separate the labeled receptor peptide-antibody complex from free 1251-labeled receptor peptide. 10 pg of
hfsh, hfsh+ or related peptide amides were immobilized on pvdf membranes and the sample-containing membranes were then incubated with 3% ovalbumin to block excess protein binding sites on the membranes, as described above. the membrane-containing
samples were then incubated with 1251-labeled  xxxd3477xxx

ret-(9-30) peptide-antibody complex (complex containing n 600,000 cpm/ml; final dilution of antibody was

to densitometric scanning as described below. control

birding of 12’i-labeled  xxxd3477xxx  ret- f9-301 peptide amide to

when ‘251-labeled ret-(9-30) peptide amide was
incubated with hfsh and hfsh+ immobilized on
pvdf membrane (immobilon-p), it effectively bound
to the hormone and subunit, as determined by analysis
of bands following autoradiography and quantitative
scanning densitometry (fig. 3). when equal amounts
(6.67 nmol) of 11 overlapping synthetic peptides representing the entire primary structure of hfsh$ were
immobilized on pvdf membranes and incubated with
r%labeled
 xxxd3477xxx  ret-(9-30) peptide amide, the nterminus  xxxg815xxx  peptide bound most effectively
to  xxxd3477xxx $ peptides l-15, 71-85 and 101-111 (fig. 3).
negligible or no binding was observed to the other
eight peptides tested. this, however, was not due to
the absence of peptides on the pvdf membranes,
since parallel blots after staining with coomassie blue
showed the presence of these peptides on them. i2’ilabeled  xxxd3477xxx  ret-(9-30) peptide did not bind to unrelated proteins (urp) (fig. 3) including bovine serum
albumin, ribonuclease-a or a 15-mer unrelated synthetic peptide similarly immobilized on pvdf membrane. moreover, 1251-labeled  xxxd3477xxx  ret-(9-30) peptide
binding to hfsh, hfsh-/3 and hfsh-@ peptides was
completely inhibited by excess solubilized follitropin
receptor, providing further evidence of a high degree
of specificity for the interactions.

understanding structure-function
relationships of
the  xxxg815xxx  requires identification of interacting regions between hormone and receptor and
elucidation of their role in activation of post-binding
events. the present study utilized a synthetic peptide
approach to examine the interaction of the extracellular n-terminus region of the  xxxg815xxx , corresponding to residues 9-30 ( xxxd3477xxx  ret-(9-30)) with discrete domains of  xxxd3477xxx  p-subunit. our results are consistent with and extend our previous findings that  xxxd3477xxx 
p- ubunit has multiple binding regions important for
specific recognition by its receptor (santa-coloma and
reichert, 1990; santa-coloma et al., 1990; reichert et
al., 1991).
the primary structure of the  xxxg815xxx  (sprengel et al., 1990), as with receptors for other pituitary
glycoprotein hormones (tsai-morris et al., 1990; xie et
al., 1990; nagayama and rapoport, 1992), includes a
large extracellular n-terminus domain thought to be
involved in the hormone binding (braun et al., 1991).
the n-terminus region, residues 9-30 of the  xxxd3477xxx 
receptor examined in the present study, has several
features characteristic of a hormone-binding region. (1)

fasman analysis (1978) suggest that this region is hydrophilic and predominantly random-coil oriented. (2)
polyclonal antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide
corresponding to this n-terminus region (9-30) of the
 xxxg815xxx  specifically recognize the native  xxxg815xxx  (dattatreyamurty
and reichert, unpublished) indicating that this domain is surface-oriented and antigenic. (3) comparison of the primary
amino acid sequences of the glycoprotein hormone
receptors reveals that the n-terminus region (9-30) of
the  xxxg815xxx  represents a unique region which has
no sequence homology with lh or tsh receptors (fig.
1a), although it is well conserved between rat and
human follitropin receptors (fig. 1b) (sprengel et al.,
1990; minegish et al., 1991). recently, we have presented multiple lines of evidence to indicate that this
n-terminus region of the  xxxg815xxx  specifically
binds  xxxd3477xxx , but not lh or tsh, suggesting a high
degree of hormone specificity (dattatreyamurty
and
reichert, 1992).
another noteworthy feature of this n-terminus region (residues 9-30) of the  xxxg815xxx  is its ability
to recognize the hormone-specific p-subunit of  xxxd3477xxx .
we have shown this by direct binding of ‘251-labeled
 xxxd3477xxx  ret-(9-30) peptide to  xxxd3477xxx -p. scatchard analysis
of the binding data indicated that the iodinated receptor peptide amide bound to hfsh$ with an association constant of 1 x 10’ m-l. the specificity of receptor peptide amide binding to  xxxd3477xxx -p was demonstrated

44

by several different approaches. first, binding of 1251labeled receptor peptide amide to  xxxd3477xxx -/3 was completely inhibited by excess soluble  xxxg815xxx . second, the radio-iodinated receptor peptide did not bind
to unrelated proteins such as bovine  xxxg124xxx 
and ribonuclease-a, or to an unrelated synthetic peptide. finally, when rabbit antibody against  xxxd3477xxx  ret-(930) peptide or pre-immune serum was pre-incubated
with radio-iodinated receptor peptide amide, the rabbit
antibody, but not pre-immune serum which served as
control, effectively inhibited the binding of ‘*?-labeled
 xxxd3477xxx  ret-(9-30) peptide to hfsh-p as well as to hfsh.
recent studies from this laboratory (santa-coloma
and reichert, 1990; santa-coloma et al., 1990, 19911,
and others (vakharia et al., 1990; campbell et al.,
1991) indicated the presence of multiple receptor-binding regions on the  xxxd3477xxx  p-subunit. similar studies on
receptors for lh and tsh also indicated that each
receptor contains more than one structural domain
involved in hormone recognition (atassi et al., 1991; ji
and ji, 1991; nagayama and rapoport, 1992; roche et
al., 1992). localization of the region-to-region contacts
between  xxxd3477xxx  and its receptor has not yet been reported, but studies to this end are critical to understanding the molecular basis for hormone recognition
by the  xxxg815xxx . since we observed that the nterminus region (residues 9-30) of  xxxg815xxx  is
capable of recognizing  xxxd3477xxx -p, we undertook to identify  xxxd3477xxx -/l regions involved in the interaction. izilabeled  xxxd3477xxx  ret-(9-30) peptide bound to three  xxxd3477xxx -p
peptides l-15, 71-85 and 101-111 out of 11 overlapping peptides derived from the primary sequence of
hfsh-p and tested simultaneously. as with intact
hfsh p-subunit, binding of ‘251-labeled  xxxd3477xxx  ret-(930) peptide to these  xxxd3477xxx -p peptides was specific,
being completely inhibited by the presence of excess
solubilized intact  xxxg815xxx . rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against  xxxd3477xxx  ret-(9-30) peptide, but not
pre-immune
serum (control), completely inhibited
binding of radio-iodinated receptor peptide to  xxxd3477xxx -p
peptides 1-15, 71-85 and 101-111. these results support the notion that recognition of  xxxd3477xxx +l by the
n-terminal region (9-30) of the  xxxg815xxx  involves
multiple contacts. the fact that these contact regions
are present in the variable regions of both  xxxd3477xxx -p and
 xxxg815xxx  (ward et al., 1990; salesse et al., 1991)
suggests that they may play a discriminatory role in
specific recognition of  xxxd3477xxx  by the receptor.
earlier studies from our laboratory have shown that
synthetic peptides corresponding to hfsh-p 33-53 and
81-95 strongly inhibited  xxxd3477xxx  binding to membranebound receptors (santa-coloma and reichert, 1990;
santa-coloma et al., 1990), while the  xxxd3477xxx -p 1-15
peptide was able to induce  xxxg815xxx -mediated
uptake of ca *+ by proteoliposomes
(grass0 et al.,
1991). hfsh+? peptides 31-45 and 71-85 possessed

significant but lesser receptor-binding activity (santacoloma and reichert, 1990). in our earlier studies
which utilized intact, in situ holo-receptor rather than
the n-terminus 9-30 domain studied in this report, no
binding inhibitory activity was seen with synthetic peptides  xxxd3477xxx -p 1-15 or 101-111. noort et al. (1992)
reported that synthetic peptides corresponding
to
 xxxd3477xxx -@ 27-45, but not 87-95, inhibited  xxxd3477xxx  stimulation of camp synthesis in sertoli cells from immature
rats. campbell et al. (19911, using chimeric recombinant hormones, reported that hfsh-p residues 88-108,
but not 33-52, were critical for  xxxd3477xxx  binding to receptor and steroidogenic activity. utilizing immunologic
techniques, vakharia et al. (1990) reported that  xxxd3477xxx -/?
sequences 33-53, 49-67 and 66-85 contained determinants required for receptor binding. the reasons for
such variable results are not clear, but are probably
related to different experimental approaches utilized.
nevertheless, it seems clear that multiple sites of interaction are required for specific recognition of hfsh
p-subunit by its receptor. taken together, these results
suggest a model whereby initial specific binding of  xxxd3477xxx 
involves interaction of its p-subunit with the extracellular n-terminus 9-30 region of the receptor, presumably involving  xxxd3477xxx -p regions l-15,71-85 and 101-111,
followed by folding of the hormone-receptor
complex
to allow interaction of other subunit regions, such as
hfsh+? 33-53 and 81-95, with the  xxxg815xxx .
each of the latter peptides has been shown to stimulate estradiol synthesis in cultured rat sertoli cells
(santa-coloma and reichert, 1990; santa-coloma et
al., 1990). the failure of 1251-labeled ret-(9-30) peptide
to interact with hfsh-p peptides 11-25, 41-55 and
51-65 is noteworthy because these  xxxd3477xxx -p peptides
were previously shown to represent a-subunit contact
regions in formation of the  xxxd3477xxx  heterodimer (santacoloma and reichert, 1991).
although synthetic hormone peptides typically show
binding affinities lower than those of intact hormones,
formation of a contiguous domain by several binding
regions would be expected to substantially increase
affinity for receptor and allow for productive interactions with receptor (reichert et al., 1991; keutmann,
1992). thus, noort et al. (19921 observed a synthetic
peptide corresponding to three discontinuous regions
of  xxxd3477xxx  to have an agonist activity at a concentration,
lo-’ m, which was significantly greater than that of
the individual peptides, the agonist activity being defined as the ability to stimulate basal camp levels in
sertoli cell membranes from immature rats. formation
of such a contiguous domain in three-dimensional
structure was suggested in our earlier studies (santacoloma et al., 1991) wherein two discontinuous regions
of hfsh-@, namely residues 33-53 and 81-95, were
synthesized as a single peptide (omitting the intervening sequence 54-80) and found to bind receptor with

45

an affinity higher than that of the individual peptides.
in this study,  xxxd3477xxx  ret-(9-30) peptide bound to  xxxd3477xxx -/3
peptides l-15,71-85 and 101-111, with relatively lower
affinities (k,, in the order lo6 m-l) than to hfsh$.
however, the sum of affinities calculated for  xxxd3477xxx -/3
peptides 1-15, 71-85 and 101-111 approximated that
observed for  xxxd3477xxx -p (k,, 1.02 x 10’ m-i). by virtue of
the extensive folding and disulfide linking within hormone subunit (between cys3 and cyss4, cys” and
cy?, cys*o and cjjs~‘~)(ward et al., 1990), important
residues from the three receptor-binding regions 1-15,
71-85 and 101-111 along the linear hfsh+? chain may
closely orient on the hormone surface to form a contiguous region in three-dimensional structure of  xxxd3477xxx ,
for productive recognition by the n-terminus (9-30)
region of the  xxxg815xxx .
our results suggest that the unique n-terminus region (residues 9-30) of the  xxxg815xxx  (i.e., not
found in lh or tsh receptors) specifically binds  xxxd3477xxx 
p-subunit. also, we present evidence that recognition
of  xxxd3477xxx -p by this region of its receptor occurs through
contacts between the latter and multiple discontinuous
binding regions of  xxxd3477xxx -p, including regions l-15, 7185 and 101-111. it is not yet known which other
potential hormone-binding region(s) of the  xxxg815xxx  are in contact with the  xxxd3477xxx  p-subunit. computerbased predictions using a sense-antisense similarity approach suggest that other  xxxd3477xxx  p-subunit contact regions may reside in the conserved regions of the  xxxd3477xxx 
receptor (slootstra and roubos, 1991). available evidence is consistent with a model wherein the interactions of  xxxd3477xxx  with its receptor involve an initial specific
recognition through contacts between n-terminus (residues 9-301 region of the  xxxg815xxx  and multiple
binding regions on hfsh-p (regions 1-15, 71-85 and
101-111) followed by a conformational change permitting receptor interaction with additional domains of
 xxxd3477xxx -/3 such as regions 33-53 and 81-95. previously,
 xxxd3477xxx -p peptides 33-53 and 81-95 were shown to bind
to membrane-bound holo-receptors as well as stimulate
estradiol synthesis by cultured rat sertoli cells (santacoloma and reichert, 1990; santa-coloma et al., 1990).
