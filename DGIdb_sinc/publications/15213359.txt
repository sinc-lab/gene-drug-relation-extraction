the influence of repeated administration of clozapine and haloperidol on the effects of the activation of 5-ht(1a), 5-ht(2) and 5-ht(4) receptors i...  the effects of a repeated treatment with antipsychotic drugs, clozapine and haloperidol, on the modulation of network activity ex vivo by 5-ht receptors were examined in rat frontal cortical slices using extracellular recording. rats were treated for 21 days with clozapine (30 mg/kg p.o.), or haloperidol (1 mg/kg p.o.). spontaneous bursting activity was induced in slices prepared 3 days after the last drug administration by perfusion with a medium devoid of mg(2+) ions and with added  xxxd2947xxx  (30 mm). the application of 2-3 microm 8-oh-dpat, acting through 5-ht(1a) receptors, resulted in a reversible decrease of bursting frequency. in the presence of 1 microm doi, the 5-ht(2) agonist, or 5 microm zacopride, the 5-ht(4) agonist, bursting frequency increased. chronic clozapine treatment resulted in an attenuation of the effect of the activation of 5-ht(2) receptors, while the effects related to 5-ht(1a) and 5-ht(4) receptor activation were unchanged. treatment with haloperiol did not influence the reactivity to the activation of any of the three 5-ht receptor subtypes. these data are consistent with earlier findings demonstrating a selective downregulation of 5-ht(2a) receptors by clozapine and indicate that chronic clozapine selectively attenuates the 5-ht-mediated excitation in neuronal circuitry of the frontal cortex while leaving the 5-ht-mediated inhibition intact.
