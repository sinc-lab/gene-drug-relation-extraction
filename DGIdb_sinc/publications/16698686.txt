background
dc are commonly defined as hla-dr /lin  cells that can be
 xxxg1208xxx   xxxg1178xxx  /, termed dc1/myeloid dc that induce a
th1 response, or  xxxg1208xxx    xxxg1178xxx , termed dc2/lymphoid dc
that induce a th2 response. however, significant heterogeneity within
dc preparations is apparent and supports the existence of several
distinct dc subpopulations. this study aimed to expand and
characterize cd34  dc for use in immunotherapy.
methods
cd34  cells were seeded at 1 /105/ml and expanded for 14 days in
rpmi/10% autologous plasma supplemented with gm-csf, il-4,
flt-3l and scf. maturation was induced with  xxxg2296xxx  and pge2
for 2 days. dc were analyzed morphologically, phenotypically with a
panel of mab to lineage and dc markers, and functionally in mlr,
t-cell assays and t-cell cytokine secretion by elisa.

was noted.
discussion
we present features of cd34  dc that have not been previously
described. the cd34  dc generated represent a population
of myeloid dc functioning as dc1 but phenoytypically expressing
markers characteristic of both dc1 and dc2. this novel
dc population is capable of inducing naive t-cell responses
and can be expanded to clinically useful numbers. cd34 -derived
dc represent attractive candidates for use in adoptive t-cell
immunotherapy.

results
significant cellular expansion was observed: 609/5 /106 dc from

introduction

memory and naive t-cell responses. this widely
accepted functional definition is, however, accompanied
by numerous inconsistently reported phenotypes. dc
have no absolute defining phenotypic marker, which in
turn makes their identification challenging. they are,
however, generally characterized by the lack of expression of lineage-specific markers whilst concomitantly
expressing high levels of mhc class ii molecules [1].

dc are specialist apc that play a critical role in the
initiation and direction of immune responses, and are
therefore being intensely investigated as potential vaccination adjuvants for many immunotherapeutic protocols.
to date, the definition of a dc has been largely
functional and is based on the ability of dc to takeup, process and present ag for the generation of both

hence, lin  hla-dr is often used as a broad phenotypic definition of a dc.
in human peripheral blood, several phenotypically
distinct subsets of dc (pbdc) have been identified
[1,2]. two distinct subsets have dominated the literature:
 xxxg1208xxx    xxxg1178xxx   /low dc have a monocytoid appearance and are referred to as ‘myeloid’ dc, whereas
 xxxg1208xxx   cd123high dc have morphologic features
similar to plasma cells and are thus referred to as
‘plasmacytoid or lymphoid’ dc [3]. the current immunologic paradigm is that myeloid dc (informally referred
to as dc1) stimulate th1 (ifn-g) responses, and
lymphoid dc (informally referred to as dc2) stimulate
th2 (il-4) responses [4]. the generation of th1
cell-mediated responses represents an essential component
in the generation of anti-tumor immunotherapeutic
protocols.
whereas pbdc represent an attractive unmanipulated
source of apc, they constitute less than 1% of circulating
white blood cells and as a result their isolation in sufficient
numbers has proved a limitation for their use [5]. since the
development of technologies that allows culture of dc in
vitro, the possibility of exploiting these cells in a number of
immunotherapeutic strategies has become a reality. various protocols are currently used to generate dc from
monocytes (mo dc) and cd34 progenitors (cd34 
dc) using different combinations of cytokines such as
gm-csf, il-4, scf,  xxxg801xxx  ligand (flt-3l), il-6, il-1b and
 xxxg2296xxx  alpha ( xxxg2296xxx ). although initial
clinical trials have been dominated by mo dc preparations [6,7], it has recently been suggested in some papers
that cd34  dc are superior to mo dc in their ability to
stimulate ag-specific t cells [4,8] because of the greater
number of langerhans’ type cells in this product. however,
thus far cd34 dc preparations remain poorly characterized [4,9].
cd34  cells, characterized by their high proliferative
potential, have the distinct advantage of being able to
proliferate and generate large numbers of dc, which in
turn can generate large numbers of ag-specific t
lymphocytes. methods describing the generation of
cd34  dc vary considerably, predominantly with cytokine conditioning, a factor known to influence dc
phenotype and function [4,10 /14]. few in-depth phenotypical analyzes of cd34 dc preparations exist within
the literature, particularly with respect to expression of
 xxxg1178xxx , the  xxxg1177xxx  receptor a-chain and certain myeloid

131

epitopes such as  xxxg382xxx  and cd15 [15].  xxxg382xxx  and cd15
function as ligands to selectins and are involved in
leucocyte activation and cell adhesion, respectively
[16,17]. to date it is yet to be reported whether cd34
dc preparations phenotypically parallel the conventional
myeloid dc1 subtype.
we report on the generation of clinically useful
numbers of dc from cd34  pbpc. we have demonstrated that the in vitro culture of cd34 progenitors in a
commonly used cytokine milieu of gm-csf, il-4, scf
and flt-3l for 14 days allows the generation of large
numbers of immature dc. maturation was then induced
within 48 h by addition of  xxxg2296xxx  and  xxxd1903xxx 
(pge2). we undertook a detailed characterization of
phenotype and function using a panel of mab to lineage
and dc markers, standard assays of t-cell proliferation
and cytokine secretion profiles. we describe the in vitro
generation of a functionally potent, phenotypically undescribed  xxxg1208xxx    xxxg1178xxx   cd34  myeloid dc
preparation to clinically useful numbers for future use in
adoptive t-cell immunotherapeutic protocols.

methods
source of cells
peripheral blood (pb) was generously donated by healthy
adult volunteers. pbsc were obtained with informed
consent from healthy adult donors enrolled in the alfred
hospital’s transplant program. pbsc were collected by
apheresis after mobilization of cells with standard doses of
recombinant g-csf. mononuclear cells (mnc) were
isolated by  xxxd3253xxx  /paque centrifugation (1.077 g/ml;
amersham pharmacia biotech, uppsala, sweden). cell
viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion.

cd34 dc culture
cd34 cells were purified from pbsc using magnetic
beads linked to anti-cd34 mab (dynal biotech, oslo,
norway). cd34  purity was confirmed by flow cytometry.
purified cd34  cells were cultured at 1 /105/ml (total
volume of 5 ml) in t25 cm2 tissue culture flasks (nunc,
roskilde, denmark) in rpmi (jhr, melbourne, australia)
medium containing 10% autologous plasma, 2 mm lglutamine (jhr), 100 u/ml/100 mg/ml penicillin/
streptomycin (jhr), 100 ng/ml gm-csf (scheringplough, schering plough, sydney, australia), 1000 u/ml
il-4 (r&d systems, minneapolis, mn, usa), 50 ng/ml
flt-3l (r&d systems) and 20 ng/ml scf (amgen,

132

ka ward et al .

melbourne, australia). cultures were maintained at 378c
in humidified 5% co2 atmosphere for 14 days. as cellular
expansion occurred, cell cultures were reseeded into
multiple flasks and medium and cytokines were replenished (approximately every 4 days). at day 14 immature
dc were matured by the addition of 10 ng/ml  xxxg2296xxx 
(sigma-aldrich, st louis, mo, usa) and 1 mg/ml pge2
(icn biomedicals, irvine, ca, usa). dc were harvested
on day 16.

morphology
dc morphology was determined by light microscopy
(olympus x760). cd34 dc were grown onto glass
coverslips, present in the dc cultures from day 0. on day
16 coverslips were removed, gently washed twice in pbs,
fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and mounted on slides for
analysis using mowiol (9.6% w/v polyvinylalcohol con-

taining 25% glycerol in 0.2 m tris hcl, ph 8.5; hoechst,
frankfurt am main, germany). the method was adapted
from previously described techniques in the literature
[18,19].

flow cytometry
cells were incubated with mab (table 1) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions in 2% fcs and 0.1% sodium
azide (nan3) in pbs. cells were washed and resuspended
in fcs/nan3/pbs.  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (pi; 3 mg/ml) was
used to identify and exclude dead cells. appropriate
matched isotype controls were used (table 1). a gate on
live cells was only used for analysis. a minimum of 10 000
events per sample was acquired using a facs calibur
cytometer (becton dickinson, mountain view, ca, usa)
and analyzed using expo 32 software (applied cytometry
systems, sheffield, uk).

t cells for allogeneic mlr and autologous t-cell assays
were obtained from freshly isolated pbmc and thawed
pbsc, respectively. t cells were isolated using a
t-cell negative isolation kit with ab to cd14, cd16
(a/b), cd56 and hla class ii dr/dp according to
manufacturer’s instructions (dynal biotech). cell viability
was determined using trypan blue. the purity of isolated
t cells was confirmed by flow cytometry and found to be
]/ 90% cd3 . isolated t cells from pbsc were
cryopreserved in autologous serum with 10% dmso
(bhd, melbourne, australia) for future autologous t-cell
assays.

immature dc on day 14 of culture were pulsed for 18 h
with 3 lf/ml tetanus toxin (tt; csl, melbourne,
australia) or 100 ng/ml keyhole limpet hemocyanin
(klh; sigma-aldrich), to induce a recall or naive t-cell
response, respectively. dc were matured on day 14 as
previously outlined. ag-pulsed dc were harvested, irradiated and set up in a 96-well round-bottomed plates at
various t cell:dc ratios in triplicate as outlined above for
mlr. proliferation was assessed by the addition of
[3h]tdr on day 5 of culture for 16 /18 h. assays were
harvested as outlined above for mlr.

dc were co-cultured with 5 /104 purified allogeneic

plates (nunc) at variable t cell:dc ratios, ranging from
2:1 to 64:1, in complete rpmi-1640 supplemented with
10% autologous plasma. dc were irradiated at 30 gy
(gammacell 1000, atomic energy of canada ltd, ontario,

assessed by the incorporation of methyl-[3h]thymidine
([3h]tdr), 1 mci/well (icn biomedicals, irvine, ca,

378c 5% co2, as measured in a beta scintillation counter
(perkin elmer, boston, ma, usa). appropriate controls
included medium alone, responding t cells alone and dc

process generated large cells of irregular shape. cells
had large ovoid or lobed nuclei and contained large
numbers of vacuoles in the cytoplasm (figure 1). long
‘dendritic’ processes extended from the cell body, as
previously described [14,20,21]. this method of growing
dc onto cover slips has been previously found in the
laboratory to be the optimal preparation for analysis of
dc morphology. cytocentrifuge preparations were
found to destroy the dc delicate dendritic processes
(data not shown).

phenotype of cd34 dc
because of the lack of an absolute defining dc marker, a
panel of mab to both dc and lineage markers was used to
assess dc phenotype. table 2 lists the mean fluorescence
intensity (mfi) at day 16 of all cell surface markers and
donor samples investigated (n /8). representative facs
analyzes from one donor sample are presented in figures
2 /4. almost all cd34  dc generated displayed cellsurface expression of  xxxg1208xxx  (99%), hla-dr (80%) and
 xxxg398xxx  (75%) and at considerable intensities, mfi 45.3, 67.7
and 71.1, respectively (table 2). subpopulations also
expressed  xxxg396xxx  (38%) and  xxxg397xxx  (32%). dc were
lineage-negative, displaying no surface ag for b cells
( xxxg375xxx ), t cells (cd3, cd8), nk cells (cd56), monocytes/macrophages (cd14) or stem cells (cd34), thus far
conforming to the general dc phenotype of hla-dr/
lin  (figure 2).
however, surprisingly, when we investigated the expression of  xxxg1178xxx , a well-defined marker of dc2, we found a
large majority of cells to express this molecule at a high
intensity. this level of  xxxg1178xxx  expression to date has not
been reported on cd34 dc preparations. we analyzed

yield
we separated the cd34  cells using magnetic bead
technology. the mean purity of the isolation was confirmed by flow cytometry to be 87.39/3.2% cd34 cells
(n /28). following a 16-day, two-step culture process,
cells were harvested, pooled and cell number calculated
using a hemocytometer and trypan blue exclusion. the
viability of cultured dc was ]/ 93% in all preparations.
total cell yield was calculated based on the number of
cells initially seeded: 0.5 /106 (1 /t25 cm2 flask) or 1 /
106(2 /t25 cm2 flask) cd34  cells depending on the
number of cells available from the mobilization of donors.
the described in vitro culture gave yield to a significant
number of dc. the mean cellular yield was 60.59/5.1/
106, equating to a total cellular expansion of 60-fold.

considerable levels of bdca-1 (mfi 36.7; table 2; n /
4). low levels of  xxxg382xxx  expression have been documented
previously on dc [22,23], although not in the proportions
and extent observed here. in concordance with other
research reports, cd4 expression was also noted on a large
proportion of dc.

ag presentation by cd34 dc
we explored the capacity of cd34  dc to generate naive
and recall t-cell responses following stimulation with
klh and tt, respectively. dc were pulsed with the
proteins in an immature state to allow ag up-take,
followed by induced maturation with  xxxg2296xxx  and pge2
for the presentation of ag. the ability of cd34  dc to
take up and present klh and tt in an autologous t-cell
assay is shown in figure 6a,b. in all assays, dc not pulsed
with ag were used as the negative control. in both
instances, klh- and tt-pulsed dc showed significantly

a defining property of dc is their potent t-cell
stimulatory capacity. the ability of cd34  dc to
stimulate t-cell proliferation in an allogeneic mlr is
shown in figure 5. dc were added in two-fold serial
dilutions to a constant number of 5 /104 t cells. all
samples assayed showed a potent allostimulatory ability at
high t cell:dc ratios, highlighting the ability of one dc to
stimulate many (64:1) t cells. increased proliferation was
shown to parallel a decrease in the ratio of t cells:dc,
achieving stimulation indices of up to 590-fold above
background levels. whereas all dc preparations showed
substantial stimulation, variability between donors was
evident.

greater proliferation compared with autologous unpulsed
controls. decreasing the ratio of t cells:dc was shown to
parallel an increase in proliferation (p -values b/0.001 at
low t cells:dc). the degree of proliferation seen was
considerable, reaching levels above 600 si and 1000 si for
klh and tt, respectively. stimulation between agpulsed dc and control unpulsed dc was statistically
significant at all t cell:dc ratios. in some instances,
however, low levels of proliferation were observed with
unpulsed dc at t cell:dc ratios of 4:1 and 2:1 (donor 2,
figure 6a; donors 1 and 2, figure 6b). we hypothesize
that this surprising observation may be attributed to
cytokine secretion by dc (e.g. il-12) stimulating resting
autologous t cells, or perhaps a result of the presentation
of auto-ag. controls such as the culture of autologous
unpulsed dc with t cells are rarely documented in the
literature, and thus further research is required to
determine the cellular basis for this low level proliferation
observed.

cytokine secretion of cd34 dc-stimulated
t cells
we analyzed the cytokine secretion profiles of cd34 
dc-stimulated t cells. supernatants from 5-day allogeneic
mlr were analyzed for cytokine levels (pg/ml) of ifn-g
and il-4 (figure 7). in all samples assayed detectable
levels of ifn-g were observed up to 300 pg/ml. little or
no il-4 was detected in all samples assayed. the secretion
of large amounts of ifn-g with minimal il-4 indicated a
th1-type t-cell response.

discussion
research into dc-based immunotherapy has surged in
recent years, thereby unveiling the significant heterogeneity that exists within dc preparations. cd34 dc have
not been well characterized, and methods used for the in
vitro generation of these cells have varied. mackensen et al .
[13] describe the expansion of cd34 dc from pbsc
collections with  xxxg1177xxx , il-6, scf, il-4 and gm-csf
followed by maturation with  xxxg2296xxx . conversely, syme
et al . [24] describe an increasingly common one-step
culture process of generating cd34 dc using  xxxg526xxx  and  xxxg2296xxx . we describe here the generation of
cd34 dc as a two-step culture process: expansion to
immature dc in presence of gm-csf, il-4, flt-3l and
scf, followed by induced maturation with  xxxg2296xxx  and
pge2. this mix of commonly used cytokines generated a
phenotypically distinct and functionally potent population
of dc that has not been previously described.
the ability to generate abundant numbers of dc
capable of effective stimulation of ag-specific t cells is a
sought-after facet that may underpin the success of dcbased immunotherapy. unlike alternative dc preparations
such as mo dc, which possess only the ability to
differentiate, cd34  progenitors have the potential to
undergo significant expansion and subsequent differentiation, thus generating larger numbers of dc [9,25].
bernhard et al . [26] reported a 5 /20-fold cellular expansion in pbsc cd34 dc cultures generated in a cytokine
cocktail of gm-csf and  xxxg2296xxx . more recently, syme et
al . [24] reported an approximate 30-fold cellular expansion from cd34  dc generated under the same cytokine
conditions. the culture of cd34 dc described herein
gave rise to a 60-fold cellular expansion, and generated
clinically useful numbers of dc from few starting
progenitor cd34 cells. the ability to routinely expand
dc up to 60-fold may be a valuable tool for clinical
immunotherapy.
the characterization of dc into myeloid or lymphoid
lineages is largely based on the expression of  xxxg1208xxx  and
 xxxg1178xxx , respectively [15,27,28]. although the cd34  dc
generated conformed to the ‘broad’ hla-dr /lin 
phenotype, they were found to phenotypically differ
from the commonly defined myeloid  xxxg1208xxx 
 xxxg1178xxx   /low dc1 population. whereas almost all cells
expressed  xxxg1208xxx , surprisingly it was found that a large
proportion of these dc concomitantly expressed  xxxg1178xxx  at
considerable intensity. this was an unexpected, yet

cd34  -derived  xxxg1208xxx   bdca-1   xxxg1178xxx   dc

interesting, observation, given the well-documented association of substantial  xxxg1178xxx  expression as a marker of
plasmacytoid dc [1,23]. low levels of  xxxg1178xxx  expression
have been reported previously on some mo dc preparations, however the proportion and intensity observed in
this study is previously undescribed in cd34 dc
preparations [1]. this  xxxg1178xxx  expression was further noted
to decrease as length of time after maturation increased. a
shift in  xxxg1178xxx  expression was clearly evident with time as
dc migrated from a double-positive  xxxg1208xxx  
 xxxg1178xxx   phenotype to a single-positive  xxxg1208xxx  
 xxxg1178xxx   phenotype.
the ontogeny of cd34 cells to dc is not clearly
understood; however, the data indicate that myeloid dc
precursors and immature dc may down-regulate expression of  xxxg1178xxx  upon maturation in cd34  dc cultures.
does this prolonged maturation and subsequent shift in
 xxxg1178xxx  expression correlate with dc maturity and, in
turn, function? preliminary work within the laboratory
suggests no significant correlation between the level of
 xxxg1178xxx  expression and the ability of cd34 dc to
stimulate allogeneic t cells (data not shown). given the
role of  xxxg1177xxx  in cell signaling and its multipotential effect
on myeloid, erythroid and megakaryocyte cells, perhaps
this  xxxg1178xxx  expression represents an artifact of the
differentiation process from cd34 progenitors to dc
[29]. further research is required in order to define the
role of  xxxg1178xxx  in cd34  dc generation. the results
obtained do, however, highlight the difficulty of, and care
that must be employed when, gating dc cell populations
based on  xxxg1178xxx  expression.
this shift in phenotype further appeared to influence
slightly the expression of myeloid markers cd15 and
bdca-1. another interesting observation was the highintensity expression of  xxxg382xxx  on all dc. low levels of
 xxxg382xxx  expression have been previously documented on
dc [22,23]; however, to date, the proportion and extent
observed here has not been documented on cd34  dc
preparations.  xxxg376xxx  is a differentiation marker expressed
by skin langerhans’ cells and bm-derived precursors
cultured in the presence of gm-csf and  xxxg2296xxx , as
well as adherent pbmc cultured in gm-csf and
il-4 [14,30]. the expression of  xxxg376xxx  observed may
indicate the presence of langerhans’ type cells in this
preparation.
the mlr studies produced unequivocal results.
cd34  dc displayed potent stimulation of allogeneic

139

resting t cells. a similar pattern was also observed in all
autologous t-cell assays. cd34  dc generated showed a
marked and statistically significant stimulation of resting
autologous t cells in response to both naive and recall ag.
substantial stimulation was seen in all t-cell assays at high
t cell:dc ratios. the ability for one dc to stimulate many
t cells is an important aspect that may influence potential
downstream clinical applications. the generation of naive
t-cell responses is a sought-after facet that is generally
proving to be a difficult task. as expected within all
functional assays, a degree of variability was seen because
of donor-to-donor differences. the observed allogeneic
t-cell stimulation of up to 600-fold and autologous t-cell
stimulation in response to a naive ag of up to 30-fold,
although difficult to compare, appear to surpass many
cd34 dc t results documented in the literature. syme
et al . [24] reported cd34 dc able to stimulate
allogeneic t cells up to 30-fold, and similar studies by
bernhard et al . [26] described cd34  dc stimulating a
naive t-cell response to the her-2 breast cancer ag no
more than three-fold above background. the potent t-cell
responses, seen in our study, generated secretion of the
th1-type cytokine ifn-g, thus further supporting the
phenotypic data indicating the differentiation and expansion of a myeloid dc preparation. although phenotypically distinct, the cd34 dc generated conformed
functionally to the ‘dc1/th1’ paradigm.
our findings show that dc generated under the
described cytokine regimen represent a previously undescribed population of myeloid cd34 dc functioning as
dc1 although phenotypically expressing markers characteristic of both dc1 and dc2. this novel dc population is capable of inducing both naive and recall t-cell
responses and can be expanded to clinically useful
numbers. the cd34  dc generated represent attractive
candidates for use in adoptive t-cell immunotherapeutic
protocols.
