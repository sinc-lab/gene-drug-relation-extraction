abstract
background:  xxxd3399xxx  is an oral nonpeptide selective vasopressin v2-receptor antagonist indicated for
the treatment of clinically relevant hypervolemic or
euvolemic hyponatremia associated with heart failure,
cirrhosis, or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic
hormone.
objective: the objective of this article was to review
the pharmacology, efficacy, and tolerability of  xxxd3399xxx 
in the treatment of hypervolemic or euvolemic hyponatremia, heart failure, and autosomal dominant polycystic
kidney disease (adpkd).
methods: articles were identified using medline
(1966–february 28, 2010) and embase (1947–february
28, 2010). abstracts and proceedings from the annual
meetings (2007–2009) of the american heart association,
the european society of cardiology, and the american
society of nephrology were searched to identify additional relevant publications. searches were conducted
using the terms  xxxd3399xxx , vasopressin antagonist, heart
failure, polycystic kidney disease, hyponatremia, drug
interaction, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacology. the
reference lists of the identified publications were reviewed for additional references. all clinical trials that
assessed the use of  xxxd3399xxx  in the management of
hypervolemic/euvolemic hyponatremia or heart failure
in humans were included, regardless of study design.
results: a total of 9 trials were identified. for the
treatment of hyponatremia,  xxxd3399xxx  was associated
with significantly increased serum sodium concentrations compared with placebo on treatment days 4 (3.62
[2.68] vs 0.25 [2.08] mmol/l, respectively; p < 0.001)
and 30 (6.22 [4.10] vs 1.66 [3.59] mmol/l; p < 0.001).
in the clinical trials in patients with heart failure, tolvapjune 2010

tan at doses of 30, 60, and 90 mg/d was associated with
mean weight changes of –1.80, –2.10, and –2.05 kg,
respectively, versus –0.60 kg with placebo (p = 0.002,
p = 0.002, and p = 0.009). trials of  xxxd3399xxx  in humans
with adpkd are ongoing. overall, mortality rates were
not significantly altered with  xxxd3399xxx  compared with
placebo (25.9% vs 26.3%). the most commonly reported adverse events associated with  xxxd3399xxx  in clinical
trials were dry mouth (4.2%–23.0%), thirst (7.7%–
40.3%), and polyuria (0.6%–31.7%), all consistent
with the mechanism of action of the drug.
conclusion: based on findings from clinical trials to
date,  xxxd3399xxx  is effective for the correction of hyponatremia but has not been associated with significant improvements in mortality in patients with heart failure
compared with placebo, and its utility in the treatment
of adpkd in humans remains to be determined. (clin

introduction
 xxxd3495xxx  (avp), also known as antidiuretic
hormone (adh), is a small peptide that maintains serum
osmolality and blood pressure.1 it is synthesized in the
hypothalamus but stored and released into the circulation by the posterior pituitary gland. the release of
accepted for publication may 7, 2010.

clinical therapeutics
vasopressin is tightly controlled and stimulated by
2 main physiologic homeostatic abnormalities: increased
plasma osmolality and decreased intravascular volume
or blood pressure.
osmoreceptors located on the anterior hypothalamus
outside of the blood–brain barrier sense changes in
plasma osmolality. vasopressin secretion is stimulated
in response to extremely small increases in osmolality,
with a 1% change resulting in vasopressin release. thus,
plasma osmolality is maintained at tight range (285–
295 mosm/kg) in healthy individuals.2 in addition to
osmoreceptors, stretch receptors sense pressure changes
in the vasculature and stimulate vasopressin secretion.
high-pressure stretch receptors located in the aortic
arch and carotid sinuses, together with low-pressure
stretch receptors located in the great veins, right atrium,
and pulmonary vessels, sense changes in blood pressure
and blood volume. decreases in blood pressure and
intravascular volume sensed by these pressure receptors
stimulate vasopressin secretion. although vasopressin
secretion is primarily stimulated in response to decreased
volume or increased osmolality, its release also might
be stimulated by other factors, such as pain, nausea,
stress, and  xxxg99xxx .
once released into the circulation, vasopressin must
then activate the vasopressin receptor to correct the
osmotic and pressure disturbances that stimulated its
release. there are ≥3 vasopressin receptor subtypes:
v1a, v1b, and v2.3 each subtype has distinct locations
throughout the body and causes unique physiologic
responses when stimulated by vasopressin (table i).
the tight control of vasopressin release is not always
maintained, and the therapeutic benefits of blocking

the actions of vasopressin may be beneficial in several
disease states in which there is an increase in vasopressin
secretion.
 xxxd3399xxx  is the first oral nonpeptide selective vasopressin v2-receptor antagonist approved for use in the
united states.4 it has an affinity for the vasopressin
v2-receptor that is 29-fold greater than that for the
v1a-receptor.  xxxd3399xxx  has no appreciable affinity for
the v1b-receptor. the affinity of  xxxd3399xxx  for the
v2-receptor is 1.8-fold stronger than that of avp.4,5
blockade of the v2-receptor prevents the insertion of
aquaporins into the luminal membrane of the renal
collecting duct, preventing free water reabsorption,
which in turn leads to an increase in free water excretion (aquaresis), a subsequent decrease in urine osmolality,
and an increase in serum sodium concentration. this
blockade exclusively affects free water and does not
alter electrolyte excretion. in contrast to conventional
diuretics, rates of sodium and potassium urinary excretion are not significantly altered, and plasma potassium
concentrations remain relatively unchanged.1,4,6
 xxxd3399xxx  has been approved by the us food and
drug administration (fda) for the treatment of clinically significant hypervolemic or euvolemic hyponatremia (associated with heart failure, cirrhosis, or syndrome of inappropriate adh [siadh]) with either a
serum sodium concentration <125 meq/l or less marked
hyponatremia that is symptomatic and resistant to fluid
restriction. in addition to the labeled indications,  xxxd3399xxx  has been assessed for the treatment of heart failure
and is being assessed in polycystic kidney disease (pkd).
the recommended administration of  xxxd3399xxx  is an
initial dose of 15 mg once daily; after ≥24 hours, the

dose may be increased to 30 mg once daily to a maximum of 60 mg once daily to achieve the desired serum
sodium concentration.  xxxd3399xxx  is currently available
in 15- and 30-mg tablet formulations.4 the average
wholesale price of  xxxd3399xxx  15- and 30-mg tablets is
$300 per tablet for each strength.7
the objective of this article was to review the clinical
pharmacology, together with the efficacy and safety
profiles, of  xxxd3399xxx  using data from clinical trials of
 xxxd3399xxx  in the treatment of hypervolemic or euvolemic
hyponatremia (associated with heart failure, cirrhosis,
or siadh), heart failure, and pkd.

methods
the medline (1966–february 28, 2010) and embase
(1947–february 28, 2010) databases were searched for
english-language literature. abstracts and proceedings
from the annual meetings of the american heart association, the european society of cardiology, and the
american society of nephrology from 2007 to 2009
were also searched to identify additional relevant publications. searches were conducted using the terms
 xxxd3399xxx , vasopressin antagonist, heart failure, polycystic kidney disease, hyponatremia, drug interaction,
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacology. the reference
lists of the identified publications were reviewed for
additional relevant publications. all clinical trials in
humans were included, regardless of design.

clinical pharmacology
pharmacokinetics
the absolute bioavailability of  xxxd3399xxx  is unknown,
but ≥40% of the dose is absorbed after oral intake and
is unaffected by food intake.4 tmax is ~2 to 4 hours after
oral intake. cmax increases proportionally with doses
≤60 mg, whereas doses >60 mg have been associated
with cmax increases that are less than proportional. cmax
increases with dose escalations to ~300 mg. although
doses used in clinical practice are much lower, at single
doses ≥300 mg, cmax reaches a plateau, suggesting that
the absorption mechanism is saturated or that dissolution is the rate-limiting factor and is limited at high
doses.1
the vd of  xxxd3399xxx  is ~3 l/kg in healthy subjects
and slightly higher in patients with heart failure.  xxxd3399xxx  has a high affinity for plasma proteins, and 99%
of circulating drug is protein bound.4  xxxd3399xxx  is
metabolized exclusively in the liver, primarily by cytochrome p450 (cyp) 3a, and exhibits almost no renal
june 2010

elimination (<1% excreted unchanged in the urine).1,6
 xxxd3399xxx  metabolites are inactive, and the estimated
t1/2 of  xxxd3399xxx  is ~12 hours.4,6,8

pharmacodynamics
the aquaretic and sodium-increasing effects of  xxxd3399xxx  have been reported to begin within 2 to 4 hours
after oral administration.4,6 the aquaretic effect is more
delayed than the rapid increase in urinary output (0.5–
1.0 hour) seen with conventional loop diuretics.6,9 an
increase in urinary output with  xxxd3399xxx  is maintained
for 24 hours, but the majority of the aquaretic effect
occurs within the first 12 hours (~60%).6 in contrast
to the aquaretic effect, increases in serum sodium concentrations are maintained throughout the 24-hour
dosing interval.4,6 the pharmacodynamic effects of
 xxxd3399xxx  are seen with doses of 15 to 60 mg once daily,
but doses >60 mg once daily have not been reported to
further increase serum sodium and are not recommended
in the product labeling.
due to the decrease in urinary excretion that occurs
after 12 hours after  xxxd3399xxx  administration, the hypothesis that twice-daily dosing might increase urinary
output in a 24-hour period compared with once-daily
dosing was studied in 40 patients with heart failure.8
the patients were randomly assigned to treatment with
 xxxd3399xxx  30 mg once daily or  xxxd3399xxx  15 mg bid
for 7 days. mean (sd) urinary output from baseline to
days 2 and 7 was not significantly different between the
once-daily and twice-daily groups (day 2, 4287 [2360] vs
4197 [3392] ml, respectively; day 7, 3524 [1634] vs
3067 [1928] ml). other clinical, pharmacodynamic,
and pharmacokinetic variables, such as change in weight,
serum electrolytes, creatinine clearance (crcl), auc,
and half-life, that were assessed were also not significantly different between the 2 groups. due to the lack
of benefit and more complex regimen of twice-daily
administration, the only dose of  xxxd3399xxx  recommended
is 15 to 60 mg once daily.4
another pharmacodynamic effect associated with
 xxxd3399xxx  administration is increased serum vasopressin
concentration, an expected feedback mechanism of
prolonged receptor antagonism.1,6

drug–drug interactions
because  xxxd3399xxx  is metabolized primarily (>95%)
by the  xxxg590xxx  isozyme, numerous potential drug–drug
interactions are possible. concurrent administration of
drugs that strongly inhibit  xxxg590xxx  might significantly
1017

clinical therapeutics
increase total exposure to  xxxd3399xxx . in one pharmacokinetic study (n = 24), concurrent administration of
a single dose of  xxxd3399xxx  30 mg and a single dose of
ketoconazole 200 mg (a strong inhibitor of  xxxg590xxx )
was associated with an 82% increase in  xxxd3399xxx  exposure.10 higher doses of ketoconazole and other strong
inhibitors of  xxxg590xxx  (eg, itraconazole, clarithromycin,
saquinavir, ritonavir, nefazodone) administered at maximum doses would be expected to result in even greater
increases in  xxxd3399xxx  exposure. for this reason, the
product labeling states that concurrent administration
of  xxxd3399xxx  and strong inhibitors of  xxxg590xxx  is contraindicated,4 although no reports of adverse events
directly resulting from these interactions were identified
in the literature search described previously.
no pharmacokinetic studies were identified that
assessed the effects of the concurrent administration of
 xxxd3399xxx  and moderate inhibitors of  xxxg590xxx  (eg, verapamil, diltiazem, fluconazole, erythromycin). however,
based on the known metabolism and pharmacokinetics,
a considerable increase in  xxxd3399xxx  exposure would
be expected, and because the appropriate dosage adjustment is unknown, concurrent administration should be
avoided.4
conversely, drugs that induce  xxxg590xxx  would be
expected to decrease  xxxd3399xxx  exposure. in one pharmacokinetic study (n = 15), rifampin 600 mg/d was
administered to subjects on days 1 through 8. on day 9,
a single dose of  xxxd3399xxx  240 mg was administered.
the concurrent use of these drugs was associated with
a decrease in  xxxd3399xxx  auc by >7.5-fold, and  xxxd3399xxx 
cmax was reduced by >85%.11 based on this reduced
exposure, it would be expected that the clinical effects
of  xxxd3399xxx  would also be diminished. although no
studies of these effects were identified, similar interactions would be expected to occur with the concurrent
administration of  xxxd3399xxx  and other  xxxg590xxx  inducers
(eg,  xxxd3116xxx , barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine,
st. john’s wort), and the dose of  xxxd3399xxx  may need to
be increased.
 xxxd3399xxx  use has been reported to alter the pharmacokinetics of other drugs, although to a much smaller
degree. in one pharmacokinetic study (n = 14), after an
initial washout period, digoxin 0.25 mg was administered on days 5 through 16.  xxxd3399xxx  60 mg was administered concurrently on days 12 through 16. the
combination of  xxxd3399xxx , a weak p-glycoprotein ( xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx )
inhibitor, and digoxin, a  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  substrate, was associated
with a 1.3-fold increase in digoxin exposure, which is
1018

unlikely to be clinically significant.12 currently, no dose
adjustments are recommended for digoxin when concurrently administered with  xxxd3399xxx .4 according to
the package labeling and the manufacturer’s data,  xxxd3399xxx  does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics
of warfarin, with minimal changes in the international
normalized ratio reported in healthy subjects who received  xxxd3399xxx  60 mg/d together with warfarin for
≤13 days.

special populations
 xxxd3399xxx  exposure has not been found to be significantly altered in patients with hepatic dysfunction,
and no dosage adjustment is recommended in this patient
population. the pharmacokinetic exposure and pharmacodynamic response to  xxxd3399xxx  in patients with
mild to severe renal impairment (crcl, 10–79 ml/min)
are similar to those in patients with normal renal function, and no dose adjustment is required.4 the literature
search did not identify any studies of  xxxd3399xxx  use in
patients with crcl <10 ml/min and/or with end-stage
renal disease receiving hemodialysis. however, due to
the mechanism of action of  xxxd3399xxx , no benefit can
be expected in patients who are anuric, and per the
package labeling,  xxxd3399xxx  should not be used in this
patient population.
 xxxd3399xxx  has not been adequately assessed for use
in pregnant women. in animal studies described in the
package labeling, cleft palate, decreased fetal weight,
and fetal death were observed.4  xxxd3399xxx  is pregnancy
category c and should be used only if the potential
benefits outweigh the potential risks. due to the narrow
indication for the use of  xxxd3399xxx , the benefit is unlikely
to outweigh the risk to a fetus and  xxxd3399xxx  use should
probably be avoided in pregnant patients. no studies
that assessed the efficacy and tolerability of  xxxd3399xxx 
in the pediatric population were identified.

efficacy
hypervolemic or euvolemic hyponatremia
overall, a total of 3 clinical trials reported that
 xxxd3399xxx  was significantly more effective for the correction of hyponatremia associated with cirrhosis, heart
failure, or siadh compared with either fluid restriction
or placebo.13–15 the clinical trials of  xxxd3399xxx  use in
hypervolemic or euvolemic hyponatremia are summarized in table ii.

clinical therapeutics
its use, the use of  xxxd3399xxx  was first assessed in the
treatment of hyponatremia, defined as serum sodium
<135 mmol/l. gheorghiade et al13 conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial
to assess the efficacy and tolerability of  xxxd3399xxx . twentyeight hospitalized patients aged ≥18 years with serum
sodium <135 mmol/l for ≥2 consecutive days secondary
to heart failure, liver cirrhosis, or siadh, and normovolemia were enrolled. subjects were randomized in a
2:1 ratio to receive oral  xxxd3399xxx  monotherapy (n =
17) at an initial dose of 10 mg/d and titrated to a maximum dose of 60 mg/d, or fluid restriction (1200 ml/d) +
placebo (n = 11), individualized to achieve normalized
serum sodium concentrations, for the duration of hospital stay or 12 days, whichever occurred first. the
primary objective of the study was to determine whether
 xxxd3399xxx  normalized serum sodium concentrations
(defined as serum sodium ≥135 mmol/l or an increase
of ≥10% from baseline to the final inpatient assessment).
findings were reported in 15 patients in the  xxxd3399xxx 
group and 8 patients in the fluid-restriction group secondary to protocol violations and withdrawal criteria.
mean (sd) changes in serum sodium concentrations
were +5.7 (3.2) and +1.0 (4.7) mmol/l with  xxxd3399xxx 
and placebo, respectively (p = 0.007). no significant
differences in the prevalences of adverse effects were
noted between the 2 groups. although interpretation
of this study was limited due to the small sample size
and short-term treatment duration (27 days), the authors
concluded that the data suggested that  xxxd3399xxx  normalized serum sodium concentrations more effectively
than fluid restriction + placebo in these hospitalized
patients.
the efficacy of oral  xxxd3399xxx  in the treatment of
hyponatremia was also reported in 2 identically designed
prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trials. investigators of the study of
ascending levels of  xxxd3399xxx  in hyponatremia (salt)
1 and 2 trials assessed the use of  xxxd3399xxx  in patients with hyponatremia (serum sodium concentration,
<135 mmol/l) secondary to chronic heart failure, cirrhosis, or siadh.14 patients with mild (130–135 mmol/l)
or marked (<130 mmol/l) hyponatremia were randomly
assigned to receive oral  xxxd3399xxx  (n = 225) or placebo
(n = 223). the primary end point was the change in
serum sodium concentration from baseline to days 4
and 30. an initial  xxxd3399xxx  dose of 15 mg/d was administered during the first 4 days of treatment, and the
dose was increased in a stepwise fashion according to
1026

a regimen designed for the slow correction of serum
sodium concentrations to ≥135 mmol/l (maximum
dose, 60 mg/d). according to the study protocol, fluid
restriction was not mandated by the investigators. in
salt-1,  xxxd3399xxx  use was associated with a statistically significant increase in the mean (sd) daily serum
sodium auc from baseline to day 4 compared with
placebo (3.62 [2.68] vs 0.25 [2.08] mmol/l, respectively;
p < 0.001). day-30 values were 6.22 (4.10) and 1.66
(3.59) mmol/l (p < 0.001). the efficacy of  xxxd3399xxx 
was supported by findings from the salt-2 trial (day 4,
4.33 [2.87] vs 0.42 [2.56] mmol/l; day 30, 6.20 [3.92]
vs 1.84 [3.83] mmol/l; both, p < 0.001). discontinuation of  xxxd3399xxx  use on day 30 was associated with
extents of hyponatremia that were similar to those with
placebo after a 7-day follow-up. approximately 25%
of  xxxd3399xxx -treated patients failed to complete the
30-day study period in both salt-1 and salt-2.
 xxxd3399xxx  resistance (defined as failure to achieve a
serum sodium increase >5 mmol/l) was identified in
the salt-2 trial in the following proportions of patients:
chronic heart failure (17%), cirrhosis (37%), and siadh
(11%).15

heart failure
heart failure is a complex clinical disorder in which
the failing heart cannot meet the physiologic demands
of the body. the physiologic derangements of inadequate
cardiac output lead to an activation of several known
neurohormonal systems.22 prolonged activation of the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas), together
with activation of the sympathetic nervous system, in
patients with heart failure leads to several adverse
consequences, including increased sodium and water
reabsorption, myocyte necrosis, collagen deposition,
and cardiac remodeling. blockade of the raas with an
 xxxg36xxx  inhibitor (acei) or an
angiotensin receptor blocker and blockade of the sympathetic nervous system with a beta-adrenergic antagonist
have led to significant improvements in heart failure
morbidity and mortality.
vasopressin secretion is chronically elevated in patients with heart failure, particularly in those with severe
disease and hyponatremia.23 this chronic elevation
likely contributes to the pathophysiology of the disease.
the hemodynamic effects of excessive vasopressin secretion include increased free water retention by the antagonism of the v2-receptor and increased pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure (pcwp), together with involume 32 number 6

c. nemerovski and d.j. hutchinson
creased systemic vascular resistance.24,25 these hemodynamic changes ultimately result in decreased cardiac
output, contribute to further activation of neurohormonal systems, and worsen the disease process. in
addition, the vasopressin v1a-receptors are found on
cardiac myocytes, and overstimulation may lead directly
to cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling.24
clinical congestion characterized by signs and symptoms of volume overload that result from heart failure
must be treated for symptomatic benefit, and diuretics
are the mainstay of treatment of fluid retention.26 conventional clinical practice and consensus guidelines
continue to support the use of diuretics despite evidence
that their use can activate the raas and lead to increased mortality.26–28 vasopressin receptor antagonists
such as  xxxd3399xxx  have been found to have a neutral
effect on the raas compared with diuretics, while still
promoting free water excretion.1
for these reasons, the effects of vasopressin receptor
antagonism in the reduction of the signs, symptoms,
and progression of heart failure have been explored
(table ii). overall, in patients with heart failure,  xxxd3399xxx  use has been associated with significantly improved
clinical symptoms of congestion but did not appear to
alter disease progression or affect mortality.
in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled study, 254 patients aged ≥18 years with heart
failure symptoms of a ≥30-day duration (irrespective
of ejection fraction [ef]) and signs and symptoms of
volume overload despite treatment with a stable dose
of furosemide and standard heart failure regimens were
randomized to receive  xxxd3399xxx  30, 45, or 60 mg/d
or placebo for 25 days.16 mean changes in weight
from baseline to day 14 were –0.60, –0.50, –0.75, and
+0.50 kg in the 30-, 45-, and 60-mg and placebo groups,
respectively (all, p = ns between doses and p < 0.001
vs placebo). in patients with hyponatremia (n = 70),
normalization of sodium concentrations was reported
in a significantly greater proportion of those treated
with  xxxd3399xxx , irrespective of the dose, compared with
placebo (82% vs 40%; p < 0.05).
a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial was conducted in 319 hospitalized
patients aged ≥18 years with decompensated systolic
heart failure (ef <40%, jugular venous distention [jvd],
rales, or peripheral edema) and who had failed initial
in-hospital treatment of heart failure.17 this study
consisted of 2 parts: an inpatient period of ≤10 days,
followed by an outpatient period of ≥60 days. patients
june 2010

were randomly assigned to receive  xxxd3399xxx  30, 60, or
90 mg/d or placebo. the primary outcome of part 1
was change in weight at 24 hours after the administration of the first dose, and the primary outcome of part 2
was the proportion of patients with worsening heart
failure (defined as hospitalization, unscheduled visit to
the emergency department or clinic with a need for
increased therapy, and/or death) at 60 days. median
changes in weight during part 1 were –1.80, –2.10,
–2.05, and –0.60 kg with  xxxd3399xxx  30, 60, and 90 mg
and placebo, respectively (p = 0.002, p = 0.002, and
p = 0.009 vs placebo; p = ns between doses). a secondary end point, mean urinary output at 24 hours, was
significantly greater with  xxxd3399xxx  compared with
placebo (4056.2, 4175.2, 4127.3, and 2296.5 ml [p =
0.02, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001 vs placebo]). at discharge,
although reduced from admission, the prevalences of
jvd and edema were not significantly different between
groups, and no significant differences were noted in the
improvements in global assessment scale score compared
with placebo. in part 1, none of the differences in mean
heart rate, blood pressure, serum potassium concentration, or markers of renal function were significant between  xxxd3399xxx  and placebo. at the end of part 2, the
proportions of patients with worsening heart failure in
the  xxxd3399xxx  and placebo groups were not significantly
different (26.7% vs 27.5%). although not powered to
detect a difference in mortality, a post hoc analysis found
that the mortality rate was numerically but not statistically lower with  xxxd3399xxx  compared with placebo
(5.4% vs 8.7%). mortality was significantly lower with
 xxxd3399xxx  in patients with severe systemic congestion on
admission (p = 0.03 vs placebo).16,17 this signal was a
hypothesis-generating finding and did not provide conclusive evidence that  xxxd3399xxx  use decreases mortality.
before the further exploration of the effects of  xxxd3399xxx  on mortality in patients with heart failure, 2 studies
were conducted to examine alternate surrogate end
points associated with heart failure.18,19 in the first
study, the effects of  xxxd3399xxx  on ventricular remodeling
were assessed using a multicenter, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled design.18 the trial enrolled
240 patients aged ≥18 years with new york heart association (nyha) class ii or iii systolic heart failure
and an ef ≤30% despite treatment with an acei and
a beta-blocker for ≥3 months and at stable doses for
≥2 weeks before enrollment. patients were randomly
assigned to receive  xxxd3399xxx  30 mg/d or placebo for
1 year. the primary outcome was the change from
1027

clinical therapeutics
baseline to 1 year in left ventricular end-diastolic volume
index (lvedvi). secondary outcomes included changes
in vital sign measurements, laboratory parameters, and
minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire18
score. at the end of treatment, mean (sd) lvedvi was
numerically but not statistically improved in the  xxxd3399xxx  group (delta, –1.8 [10.7] ml/m2) and was essentially
unchanged from baseline in the placebo group (delta, +0.04
[10.0] ml/m2). none of the between-group differences
in mean blood pressure; heart rate; or concentrations
of serum potassium, blood urea nitrogen, or serum
creatinine were statistically significant. changes in
minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire
scores were not significantly different between groups.
the mean (sd) increase in serum vasopressin concentration was significantly greater with  xxxd3399xxx  compared
with placebo (+0.5 [1.2] vs –0.3 [2.1] pg/ml; p = 0.03),
as expected with long-term receptor antagonism. although the study was not designed or powered to detect
differences in the rates of hospitalization for heart failure
and mortality, the composite prevalence of these outcomes was significantly lower with  xxxd3399xxx  compared
with placebo (hospitalization, 18% vs 28%, respectively;
mortality, 5% vs 9% [composite, p < 0.03]). these
events, however, were reported by investigators and not
adjudicated by a central events committee. the authors
concluded that treatment with  xxxd3399xxx  for 1 year had
no significant effect on lvedvi, but they also noted
that there were no adverse effects on remodeling, suggesting that prolonged v1a stimulation during v2 antagonism does not have deleterious clinical effects. they
also acknowledged the need for further exploration of
the differences in mortality between groups in a prospectively designed and adequately powered trial.
the second study before the effect of  xxxd3399xxx  on
mortality could be adequately assessed aimed to define
the acute hemodynamic effects associated with  xxxd3399xxx 
administration.16 that multicenter, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 181 patients aged ≥18 years with an ef <40% and nyha
functional class iii or iv heart failure despite treatment
with standard background therapy for heart failure for
≥1 month. after initial enrollment criteria were met,
patients underwent insertion of a pulmonary artery
catheter. patients with a pcwp >18 mm hg on 2 readings ≥10 minutes apart 2 hours before study drug administration were eligible. patients were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of  xxxd3399xxx  15, 30, or
60 mg or placebo. hemodynamics, vital signs, and renal
1028

function were assessed at multiple time points over the
8-hour period after study drug administration. background heart failure therapy and diuretics were discontinued during the study period. mean (sd) changes in
pcwp from baseline to 3 to 8 hours after study drug
administration were –6.38 (4.12), –5.67 (4.58), –5.71
(4.35), and –4.16 (4.57) mm hg with  xxxd3399xxx  15, 30,
and 60 mg and placebo, respectively (p = ns between
doses; p < 0.01, p < 0.05, and p < 0.05 vs placebo).
none of the differences in other hemodynamic parameters, such as systemic vascular resistance, cardiac index,
or pulmonary vascular resistance, were statistically
significant between the  xxxd3399xxx  and placebo groups.
none of the changes from baseline in vital sign measurements, serum potassium concentrations, blood urea nitrogen, or serum creatinine concentrations were clinically
or statistically significant with  xxxd3399xxx  or placebo.
findings from these small studies to establish adequate assessment of surrogate end points and signals
suggested that treatment with  xxxd3399xxx  could improve
clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure. after
these findings were established, a large-scale, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to establish the effects of  xxxd3399xxx  on mortality.
the efficacy of vasopressin antagonism in heart failure
outcome study with  xxxd3399xxx  (everest) trial consisted of 2 parts. the effects of  xxxd3399xxx  on clinical
condition were assessed in 2 identically designed shortterm in-hospital trials (trials a [n = 2048] and b [n =
2085]).20 the 2 short-term trials were combined, and
the 4133 patients were followed up for ≥60 days to assess
the long-term clinical outcomes, including mortality.21
patients were eligible if they were ≥18 years of age, had
systolic heart failure (ef ≤40%), and were hospitalized
for worsening heart failure symptoms, which included
symptoms at rest or on minimal exertion and ≥2 signs
of congestion (dyspnea, jvd, and/or peripheral edema).
patients were randomly assigned to receive  xxxd3399xxx 
30 mg or placebo once daily, to be started within
48 hours of admission and administered for ≥7 inpatient
days or until discharge. conventional therapies for heart
failure, including diuretics, were continued and chosen
at the discretion of the treating physician. the primary
end point of the short-term trials was a composite score
of changes from baseline in patient-assessed global
clinical status and weight at day 7 or discharge.20 two
primary outcomes of the long-term combined trials
were assessed using a time-to-event analysis: (1) all-cause
mortality and (2) a composite score of cardiovascular
volume 32 number 6

c. nemerovski and d.j. hutchinson
disease (cvd)-related death and hospitalization for
heart failure.21 the median duration of follow-up in
the long-term trial was 8 months. the differences in
all-cause mortality (25.9% vs 26.3%) and cvd-related
death and hospitalization for heart failure (42.0% vs
40.2%) between  xxxd3399xxx  and placebo were nonsignificant. however,  xxxd3399xxx  met prespecified criteria
for noninferiority compared with placebo for all-cause
mortality (p < 0.001). in both trials, the composite
primary outcome was significantly improved with
 xxxd3399xxx  compared with placebo (trial a, 1.06 [0.43] vs
0.99 [0.44]; trial b, 1.07 [0.42] vs 0.97 [0.43]; both,
p < 0.001 [rank sum analysis]). these differences in the
composite primary outcome were likely driven primarily
by significantly greater mean (sd) changes in weight in
the  xxxd3399xxx  groups compared with the placebo groups
(trial a, +3.35 [3.27] vs +2.73 [3.34] kg; trial b, +3.77
[3.59] vs +2.79 [3.46] kg; both, p < 0.001). no significant differences in mean (sd) patient-assessed global
clinical status scores were noted between the  xxxd3399xxx 
and placebo groups (trial a, 18.25 [22.26] vs 17.73
[22.47]; trial b, 18.72 [21.71] vs 18.28 [21.59]). secondary outcomes included a composite end point of
cvd-related mortality and hospitalization rates (48.5%
vs 46.4%), cvd-related mortality (20.3% vs 19.8%),
and the prevalence of worsening heart failure (36.5%
vs 35.8%) (all, p = ns).
in these trials of  xxxd3399xxx  in heart failure,  xxxd3399xxx 
was used in conjunction with conventional loop diuretics. a trial comparing  xxxd3399xxx  to conventional loop
diuretics is needed to determine whether the avoidance
of loop diuretics and reduced activation of the raas
might improve mortality in patients with heart failure.

polycystic kidney disease
the effects of vasopressin v2-receptor antagonists
(lixivaptan,  xxxd3399xxx ) in the treatment of pkd have
also been investigated.29–31 the disease is characterized
by the accumulation of fluid-filled cysts that originate
from the renal tubules and that are located in the renal
parenchyma. as the disease progresses, the cysts continually increase in size because of proliferation and
active secretion of fluid by the epithelial cells lining the
cysts.32 the inheritance of pkd can be categorized as
autosomal dominant pkd (adpkd) or as an autosomal
recessive trait. adpkd is most commonly found in
adults, with a prevalence of 1 in 500 to 1 in 1000 persons worldwide,33 and is characterized by genetic mutations in  xxxg1842xxx  or pkd2, the genes that encode the
june 2010

proteins polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, respectively. a
mutation in the pkhd1 gene, which encodes the protein
fibrocystin, leads to the autosomal recessive type of
pkd, which primarily affects infants and children, with
a prevalence of 1 in 6000 to 1 in 40,000.32,33 cyclic
3′,5′- xxxd81xxx  (camp) causes the fluid
secretion and the proliferation of renal cysts. evidence
suggests a relationship between polycystin defects in
pkd and intracellular camp.29,34 polycystin-1 and
polycystin-2 may directly inhibit  xxxg67xxx , which
in turn might reduce ≥1 of the proteins that promote
cyst development through an increase in intracellular
camp.34 in several animal models, an increase in circulating vasopressin has been found to stimulate the
development of renal cysts by increasing intracellular
camp. some cysts in pkd express vasopressin v2receptors that activate  xxxg67xxx  in the presence of
vasopressin.34–37 therefore, the use of v2-receptor antagonists such as  xxxd3399xxx  might play a role in inhibiting
renal cyst development. this hypothesis was supported
by findings from a study by wang et al,31 in which rats
with pkd were fed  xxxd3399xxx  0.01%, 0.03%, and 0.1%
from weeks 4 to 10 of life and were compared with
control rats (no  xxxd3399xxx  administration).  xxxd1891xxx  weeks,
mean changes from baseline in kidney weight, cyst
volume, and fluid volume were significantly greater
compared with those in controls.31
based on those findings, clinical trials of the efficacy
of  xxxd3399xxx  in humans with pkd are being conducted.
a phase iii, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
parallel-arm trial ( xxxd3399xxx  efficacy and safety in
management of polycystic kidney disease and its outcomes [tempo 3/4]) involving ~1500 patients is ongoing.
patients aged 18 to 50 years with preserved renal function and a diagnosis of adpkd with rapidly progressive
kidney growth (total volume, >750 ml) were eligible for
enrollment. patients are being followed up for 36 months.
the primary outcome of the trial is the long-term efficacy
of  xxxd3399xxx  in adpkd, assessed by monitoring the rate
of renal volume change using magnetic resonance imaging. secondary outcome measures include the progression
of adpkd using clinical markers, such as hypertension,
renal pain, albuminuria, and renal function. the study
is expected to be completed in january 2011.

tolerability
adverse effects
in clinical trials, the most commonly reported adverse
events associated with  xxxd3399xxx  were dry mouth (4.2%–
1029

clinical therapeutics
23.0%), thirst (7.7%–40.3%), and polyuria (0.6%–
31.7%), all consistent with the mechanism of action of
the drug.13,14,16–21 other adverse events reported at a
rate of ≥2% greater than with placebo included constipation (7%), anorexia (4%), hyperglycemia (6%), weakness (9%), and pyrexia (4%).4 extremely rare adverse
events (<2% of patients treated with  xxxd3399xxx ) included
cerebrovascular accident, deep vein thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, diabetic ketoacidosis, ischemic colitis, prolonged prothrombin time,
rhabdomyolysis, pulmonary embolism, urethral and
vaginal hemorrhage, and ventricular fibrillation.  xxxd3399xxx  was fairly well tolerated, with rates of discontinuation due to adverse events ranging from 3.6% to 25.2%
versus 23.0% with placebo.4,13,14,16–21 although not
reported in every trial, the incidence of hypernatremia
was numerically greater with  xxxd3399xxx  (1.4%–1.8%)
compared with placebo (0%–0.5%).14,20,21 a statistically
significant difference in the prevalence of hypernatremia
was observed between  xxxd3399xxx  and placebo in trial a
of the everest study (1.4% vs 0%; p < 0.001).20

treatment with  xxxd3399xxx  corrects hyponatremia associated with these disease states and is fairly well tolerated.
although it has been hypothesized that blockade of the
vasopressin receptor may alter disease progression in
heart failure, a review of the published literature found
that  xxxd3399xxx  use was associated with corrected serum
sodium concentrations in hyponatremic patients but
that mortality and disease progression remained unchanged. future trials that compare traditional loop
diuretics to  xxxd3399xxx , as opposed to their concurrent
use, are needed to fully assess the effects of  xxxd3399xxx 
use on disease modification in heart failure. until then,
 xxxd3399xxx  may be used for the correction of hyponatremia, but its role in the treatment of heart failure is
not supported by findings from large-scale clinical trials.
the role of  xxxd3399xxx  in the treatment of pkd in humans
remains to be assessed.

precautions and contraindications

references

although the use of  xxxd3399xxx  has been fairly well
tolerated in clinical trials, there are several warnings,
precautions, and contraindications in the product labeling.4 treatment with  xxxd3399xxx  must be initiated in
the hospital in all patients. this requirement has been
mandated by the fda to avoid a rapid increase in serum
sodium concentrations and the associated risk for osmotic demyelination.  xxxd3399xxx  use should be avoided
in patients with abnormal thirst, and fluid restriction
should be avoided during the first 24 hours of treatment
with  xxxd3399xxx .  xxxd3399xxx  should not be used to acutely
correct hyponatremia. the combination of hypertonic
saline and  xxxd3399xxx  for the correction of hyponatremia
has not been assessed and thus should be avoided.
because  xxxd3399xxx  is metabolized primarily by the
 xxxg590xxx  isozyme, the concurrent administration of
 xxxd3399xxx  and a strong or moderate  xxxg590xxx  inhibitor
should be avoided.

conclusions
in the absence of a pathogenic process, the release of
vasopressin is highly regulated and serum osmolality is
tightly controlled. however, in certain disease states,
vasopressin release may be increased, leading to clinically evident hyponatremia and other adverse sequelae.
findings from published clinical trials suggest that
