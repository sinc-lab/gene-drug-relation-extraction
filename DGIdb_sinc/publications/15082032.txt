abstract
objective: this paper describes the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics, in terms of monoamino oxidase type b (mao-b)
inhibition, in male healthy volunteers of orally administered  xxxd3158xxx , a new neuroprotectant that in experimental models has demonstrated
strong anticonvulsant and antiparkinson activities. methods: four clinical trials covering the dose range of 25–10,000 ␮g/kg were carried out
to describe pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tolerability of  xxxd3158xxx , administered in single or repeated dose regimen to steady
state, including a food interaction trial. all the above trials were carried out after the ethics committee’s approval and signature of the consent
form by the volunteers. in single dose trials blood sampling covered a 24 h-period in pharmacodynamic trials, 48 h-period in pharmacokinetic
trials. in the case of repeated dose regimen to steady state a pre-dose sample was drawn on the first six study days, whereas the curve was
explored on the 7th study day, prolonging blood sampling over a 48 h-period after the last dosing.  xxxd3158xxx  level was determined in plasma
by a very sensitive and specific lc–ms–ms method, with a low limit of quantification of 0.5 ng/ml of plasma. pharmacokinetic analysis
was carried out with non-compartmental method and, in one case, also with the two-compartmental method. monoamine oxidase activity
of both types a and b (mao-a and mao-b) was determined in plasma at different times (mao-b) and correlated to  xxxd3158xxx  levels,
or in urine (mao-a). results: pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3158xxx  proved to be linearly and proportionally related to the administered doses.
the absorption of  xxxd3158xxx  was rapid with peak plasma concentrations ranging from 2 to 4 h. food prolonged the rate and did not affect
the extent of absorption of  xxxd3158xxx . in repeat dose regimen once daily, the steady state was reached on the 5th study day with a marginal
accumulation factor of 1.5–1.7. the drug was cleared with a t1/2 of about 22 h.  xxxd3158xxx  reversibly inhibited mao-b enzyme. full
inhibition was observed with single doses ≥ 600 ␮g/kg, and a relevant, dose dependent, progressive inhibition was encountered with doses
starting from 25 ␮g/kg. even at the highest single dose of 10 mg/kg no evidence of mao-a inhibition was observed. conclusion: enteral
absorption of the drug is linear and proportional to the doses administered. the drug is cleared from the body with a t1/2 of ∼
=22 h, without
producing any clinically relevant accumulation at steady state. the mao-b inhibitory activity, without affecting mao-a, is useful to prevent
a dopamine bioinactivation in patients suffering from parkinson’s disease.  xxxd3158xxx  tolerability in the four clinical trials proved to be good.

ticonvulsant and antiparkinsonian activities [4–7]. due to
the excellent therapeutic and safety margin,  xxxd3158xxx 
is under clinical development as an antiparkinsonian and
anticonvulsant agent.
this paper describes pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, in terms of mao inhibition and tolerability, after  xxxd3158xxx  administration in healthy male human
volunteers in single and repeated dose regimen in the dose
range from 25 ␮g/kg to 10 mg/kg, including a food interaction trial.
pharmacodynamics covered the selectivity of the mao
inhibition, which is an important issue as non-selective inhibitors can lead to life-threatening hypertensive crisis via

the potentiation of peripheral adrenergic stimulation caused
by food tyramine. pharmacokinetics covered the descriptive
behaviour, dose-linearity, dose-proportionality and food effect.
an in vitro study was carried out where  xxxd3158xxx  was
incubated with specific probes of five cyp450 isozymes
in human liver microsomes to achieve preliminary data of
possible  xxxd3158xxx  interactions.
data presented here were obtained in various trials carried
out during the last 3 years and are discussed in the present
paper in order to give a comprehensive picture of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this new interesting
drug.
2. materials and methods
2.1. description of the experimental trials
four pharmacokinetic trials on healthy male volunteers
[8–11] and one preliminary in vitro study on the potential
inhibitory activity on human cyp450 substrates [12] are
considered in this paper. in these trials pharmacokinetics,
tolerability, food interaction and the inhibitory activity of
 xxxd3158xxx  versus mao enzymes were evaluated.
the clinical trials covered a very wide dose range from
25 ␮g/kg to 10 mg/kg, in part administered in single dose,
and in part in repeated dose regimen to steady state. the
doses 25, 50, 75 and 150 ␮g/kg were given to establish
the ed50 for mao-b inhibition. table 1 summarizes the
main characteristics of the four clinical trials carried out.

all the clinical studies were approved by the ethics committee of canton ticino, switzerland. detailed information
about the protocols, including risks, were given to the subjects before written informed consent was obtained.
the studies were conducted in accordance with the international conference of harmonization (ich) guidelines
[13] for good clinical practice and in compliance with the
declaration of helsinki and its further amendments [14].
2.3. clinical procedures
as these trials were the first administration in humans
of  xxxd3158xxx , special attention was paid in planning and
conducting the studies.
all subjects were male healthy volunteers of caucasian
origin. they all had normal physical examination, electrocardiograms, vital signs, and routine laboratory tests, which included a complete haematological/biochemical profile, urinalysis, negative virological tests for hiv, hepatitis b and c
and drug of abuse screen. with the exception of virological
tests, the above tests were repeated at the end of individual
trials.
all subjects were non-smokers, non-vegetarian and with
no previous allergic response to anticonvulsant drugs. in
addition, they had not used regularly any prescription or
over-the-counter medication, nor consumed foods or liquid
containing tyramine from 3 days prior to study initiation
and until study end, not taken caffeine containing beverages,
fresh grapefruit, grapefruit juice or alcohols from 48 h prior
to and until study end, not been treated with any known enzyme inhibiting or inducing agents, like cimetidine or barbiturates, had not undergone a blood donation or taken part
in a clinical trial in the previous 3 months.
before drug dosing the subjects were in fasting conditions starting from previous evening. fasting continued for
additional 4 h. the subjects were hospitalized the evening

before the administration day until 48 h post-dosing, and a
diet control had been implemented during hospitalization.
no medication was allowed starting from 7 days prior to
enrolment throughout the study period.
 xxxd3158xxx  at doses ≥ 900 ␮g/kg and, when planned, a
matched placebo, were administered as 10 or 50 mg capsules, calculating the dose in individual volunteers from the
kg of body weight by an approximation to the proximal low
value. the doses of 25, 50, 75 and 150 ␮g/kg were administered as extemporaneous water solution containing  xxxd3158xxx  the day before repeated dose regimen with 2.5 and
5.0 mg/kg initiation in trial 2.
during the first 10 h after dosing with trial 1, ecg
and heart rate were continuously monitored by telemetry,
whereas the vital signs were measured hourly.
in the case of repeated dose regimen, the day when the
plasma concentration time curve was evaluated, the administration was carried out in fasting conditions from previous 12 h, fasting continued for additional 4 h; water was not
allowed since 1 h before to 2 h after drug ingestion, with
the exception of the 250 ml planned for drug ingestion. the
days when the curve was not explored, the administration
was carried out before a standardized light breakfast, without restriction on water ingestion.
within trial 4 (food interaction trial) during one period,
volunteers were treated in fasting condition, and in the other
period the following high-fat content breakfast was served
before dosing, according to operating guidelines [15,16]:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

one buttered muffin (fat = 9.2 g);
one fried egg (fat = 10.0 g);
30 g of cheese (fat = 10.2 g);
one piece of bacon (fat = 4.0 g);
one serving of boiled potatoes (fat = 9.6 g);
250 ml of whole milk (fat = 8.25 g);
approximate caloric content = 1000 kcal.

in all the trials, plasma concentration–time curve was
studied over a 48 h-period. in the case of trial 2, on the
first study day when the doses 25, 50, 75 and 150 mg/kg

79

were administered, plasma concentrations were followed over a 24 h-period; a pre-dose blood sample was
drawn the following 6 days when repeated dose regimen was studied, whereas the complete curve was followed on the 7th study day for a 48 h-period after the last
dose.
2.4.  xxxd3158xxx  bioassay
two methods were validated to assay  xxxd3158xxx  in human
plasma, one (bioassay) covering the linear range between
20 and 20,000 ng/ml and another (microbioassay) more sensitive covering the range from 0.5 to 20 ng/ml. the main
difference between the two lc–ms–ms methods was the
extraction procedure. table 2 shows the analytical details of
the two methods adopted.
a weighted (1/c2 ) regression analysis on data of a
seven-point calibration curve allowed concentration of  xxxd3158xxx  to be calculated from the  xxxd3158xxx  to internal
standard (i.s.) peak area ratio.
the two methods were fully validated according to the
accreditated international criteria [17]. linearity was ascertained in the above dynamic ranges.
precision and accuracy were determined from both
inter-and intra-assay tests and invariably resulted better than
6.9%, including results obtained with the limit of quantitation. recovery of  xxxd3158xxx  and internal standard proved
to be close to 100%.
 xxxd3158xxx  proved to be stable in plasma for 24 h at room
temperature, for three freeze/thaw cycles and at 4 ◦ c on the
final solution in autosampler tray for 24 h.
2.5. interaction with cyp450 probes
 xxxd3158xxx  was incubated in human liver microsomes
(mixed pool of 15 donors) at the concentrations of 0.5, 5, 10,
50, and 100 ␮mol/l with five substances, probes for specific
cyp450 isozymes, in order to test its potential inhibitory
effect [12]. probe reactions were as follows.

values dose-normalized to one of the used doses. these dosenormalized values were used to test dose-proportionality
with one-way anova.
statistical analysis covered descriptive statistics, student’s
t-test for paired samples to test compartmental versus noncompartmental procedure, one-way anova to test doseproportionality, regression analysis to test dose-linearity
and 90% confidence intervals to test food effect.

3. results
2.6. mao activity measurements

3.1. single dose in the range 2.5–10.0 mg/kg (trial 1)

according to tipton et al. [18], mao-b activity was determined incubating 14 c-phenylethylamine (pea) in plateled
enriched plasma in the presence and in the absence of  xxxd3158xxx  and assaying the formation of 14 c-pea by liquid
scintillation with the method of la croix et al. [19].
the inhibitory potential of  xxxd3158xxx  on mao-a activity
was assessed with the method of rizzo and melzi [20] by
measurement of plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylethylenglycol (mhpg) in urine by hplc with coulometric electrochemical detection.

single dose of  xxxd3158xxx  (2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg) to
eight volunteers, resulted in plasma concentration–time
profiles which increased with increasing doses (fig. 2). the
two-compartmental and the non-compartmental analyses
produced overlapping pharmacokinetic parameters (table
3). student’s t-test for paired data did not show any statistically significant difference of pharmacokinetic parameters
between the compartmental and non-compartmental models.
dose-linearity was checked by the linear regression
method on cmax , auc0–48 h and auc∞ and produced
with all these parameters a statistically significant degree
(p < 0.001), allowing confirmation of dose-linearity.
dose-proportionality was checked on dose-normalized
cmax , auc0–48 h and auc∞ and on the other parameters
as such by the one-way anova. no statistically significant
differences were encountered, which leads to the assumption of dose-proportionality.

2.7. pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses
in all the trials pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated by a non-compartmental analysis. in addition, the
two-compartmental analysis was carried out in trial 1.
the following parameters were evaluated:
cmax (ng/ml)
tmax (h)
cmin (ng/ml)
auct (ng/ml h)

peak concentration (maximum plasma

time to peak plasma concentration
minimum plasma concentration in

experimental area under the curve
calculated by the trapezoidal rule
from time 0 to the last available
concentration
auc extrapolated to infinity

3.2. single dose in the range 25–150 µg/kg (trial 2)
as mao-b activity resulted fully inhibited at all doses in
the mg/kg range, lower doses in the ␮g/kg range were given
in a preliminary part of trial 2 in order to establish a dose
response curve with the relative ed50 . in this case plasma
concentrations of  xxxd3158xxx  were followed over 24 h. a
repeated dose regimen at higher doses started the next day.
the short blood sampling period prevented t1/2 and auc∞
to be evaluated, thus only cmax , tmax and auc0–24 h were

the mao-b enzyme was partially and dose-progressively
inhibited in the dose range 25–150 ␮g/kg (trial 2) (table 5).
ed50 for mao-b inhibition proved to be 87.5 ␮g/kg versus a supramaximal inhibition activity achievable with the
 xxxd3158xxx  at doses in the mg/kg range.
3.3. repeated dose regimen (trials 2 and 3)
in the trials 2 and 3,  xxxd3158xxx  was investigated in repeated dose regimen, namely 1.25 mg/kg (trial 3), and 2.5

and 5.0 mg/kg (trial 2), once daily over 7 days. pharmacokinetic parameters obtained are listed in table 6. as shown
by the pre-dose plasma concentrations of  xxxd3158xxx , the
steady state was reached on the 5th study day (table 7).
in fig. 3 the three behaviours at the steady state were superimposed. the regression analysis on cmax and aucss,tau
demonstrated a statistically significant dose-linearity.
one-way anova on pharmacokinetic constants and on
dose-normalized cmax and aucss,tau statistically confirmed
the dose-proportionality encountered in the single dose
trial.

table 8 lists mean pharmacokinetic parameters measured
in the two situations, namely administering  xxxd3158xxx 
(900 ␮g/kg) in fasting status and after the high-fat content
breakfast. fig. 4 shows the two plasma concentration–time
behaviours obtained. the  xxxd3158xxx  administration after a
high-fat content breakfast led to a more sustained absorption rate (tmax 4.83 versus 1.50 h) than when administered
in fasting condition. also cmax was affected by the meal,
showing lower values when given after meal than when
given in fasting situation (arithmetic mean values 343.51
versus 409.30 ng/ml, 90% c.i. 0.77–0.92). the extent of
absorption was not affected by food, as 90% confidence
intervals with auc0–48 h and auc∞ were comprised in
the 0.80–1.25 range, stipulated by operating guidelines
[13,14], to exclude food effect (table 9) this in spite of
marginally higher values encountered with aucs in fasting
situation.

the only inhibition found was the o-deethylation of

47.7 ␮m (=14,300 ng/ml). however, this inhibition is of
negligible relevance, as the ic50 values are markedly higher
than the cmax values observed with the highest dose of
 xxxd3158xxx  administered in healthy volunteers (10 mg/kg).

from the metabolic viewpoint  xxxd3158xxx  can be hydroxylized, o- or/and n-dealkylized and hydrolyzed at the
amide level (fig. 1). specific metabolic investigations are
in progress to define the metabolic fate of  xxxd3158xxx .

3.6. safety
the tolerability of  xxxd3158xxx  was ascertained from vital signs, blood/urine laboratory parameters, ecg, objective
and subjective evaluation of any symptom, which were carefully evaluated before, during and after each trial. no safety
problem was encountered. at the repeated dose regimen of
5 mg/kg one volunteer presented an increase of alt, approximately three times the upper laboratory limit, that was
judged of no clinical relevance and fully reverted to normal range. minor subjective complaints included transient
headache and light headedness of a few hours duration at or
above 2.0 mg/kg, experienced by some volunteers.

4. discussion
 xxxd3158xxx  administered per os to human subjects in the
dose range 25–10,0000 ␮g/kg proved to be well absorbed
peaking on average at 2–4 h after dosing.
most relevant pharmacokinetic considerations on  xxxd3158xxx  are related to the demonstration of doselinearity and dose-proportionality. dose-linearity and doseproportionality are two close concepts that may coexist,
as usually occurs with xenobiotics, but hardly coexist
with endogenous substances, which are characterized by
baseline concentrations. in these cases dose-linearity is
achievable, whereas dose-proportionality is demonstrated
only after the subtraction of the baseline, which leads to an
intercept on the auc, or cmax , or cue axis, as reviewed
by marzo [21]. with  xxxd3158xxx  both dose-linearity and
dose-proportionality were statistically demonstrated with
specific tests, namely linear regression analysis and oneway anova. a general demonstration of dose-linearity
in pharmacokinetics requires that auc∞ of a single dose
overlaps with aucss,tau in steady state. this was fully verified in the trials 1 and 2 carried out with  xxxd3158xxx , as
shown in table 10.

an issue which has a great clinical impact is whether
any accumulation of concentrations in steady state occurs.
 xxxd3158xxx  administered in steady state reaches cmin values
3–4 times lower than cmax in single dose, whereas cmax
values in steady state are 1.5–1.7 times higher than cmax
obtained in single dose with the same doses. these data lead
to the conclusion that no relevant accumulation occur with
 xxxd3158xxx  at steady state in subjects with normal excretory
function.
food effect of  xxxd3158xxx  is, as expected with most drugs,
a more sustained rate of absorption without affecting the
extent of absorption.
from data obtained in vitro experiments, no relevant
interactions in oxidative metabolic pathways controlled by
cyp2c9, cyp2c19, cyp2d6, cyd2e1 and cyp3a4.
these data would seem a greenlight on  xxxd3158xxx  further
development, where multitherapy is often practiced, mainly
in elderly, target population for these drugs.
further pharmacokinetic investigations on  xxxd3158xxx 
should be addressed to define the metabolic cascade and the
elimination pattern of metabolites, also in patients suffering
from liver disease and kidney impairment.
 xxxd3158xxx  proved to reversibly inhibit mao-b activity
without affecting mao-a. this inhibition was complete at
doses in the mg/kg range, and proved to effectively operate
in a dose-related manner also in the ␮g/kg range.
mao-b inhibition reduces the metabolic inactivation of
exogenously supplied as well as the endogenous dopamine
formed from its precursor, levodopa. this result is of great
relevance for parkinson’s disease, where that with levodopa
is the most effective treatment, and thanks to the mao-b
inhibition can prolong its activity.
in toxicokinetic studies in primates in a 3-monthsafinamide treatment, 24 h after the last dosing, an approximated 50% putaminal dopamine augmentation has been
observed, associated with an inversely proportional decrease
of dopamine metabolites homovanillic acid (hva) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (dopac), and a brain mao-b
inhibition of 50–65% [22,23].
keeping in mind that: (a) steady state peak levels of
 xxxd3158xxx  are about 1.5–1.7 times those reached after
single dose, and (b) in humans levels of about 200 ng/ml
are reached with 600 ␮g/kg dose with a corresponding
91% mao-b inhibition (table 5), doses greater than
300–600 ␮g/kg at steady state should provide a total  xxxg1358xxx  inhibition. thus, it appears that on top of expected
neuroprotectant properties of  xxxd3158xxx  related to the ion
channel blocking activity and the consequential diminution of glutamate release [5], the mao-b inhibition may
cause reduced oxidative stress and increased brain levels of
dopamine. altogether these multiple mechanisms will add
to the potential parkinson’s effects of the drugs. phase ii
study are in progress to confirm these expectations.
the safety of  xxxd3158xxx  proved to be good. this resulted
from the vital signs, blood/urine biochemical analyses, adverse events observed in the trials described in this paper

a. marzo et al. / pharmacological research 50 (2004) 77–85

and from the results of the pressor response to intravenous
tyramine in healthy volunteers treated with  xxxd3158xxx  or
placebo, where no difference between the drug and placebo
was encountered [23,24]. the marginal alt increase occasionally observed in one subject proved to be fully reversible
and was considered not clinically relevant. thus  xxxd3158xxx 
can be considered a safe and well tolerated compound.
those, described in this paper are the first pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and tolerability data of  xxxd3158xxx 
in humans. in addition to their descriptive meaning, they effectively support further trials of phase ii in target population in terms of dose-range finding and also further widening
pharmacokinetic investigations.
