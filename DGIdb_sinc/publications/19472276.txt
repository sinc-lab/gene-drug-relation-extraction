screening of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors by ce
after enzymatic reaction at capillary inlet
in this study the development of a procedure based on capillary electrophoresis
after enzymatic reaction at capillary inlet methodology for the screening and in
vitro evaluation of the biological activity of acetylcholinesterase (ache) inhibitors is
presented. the progress of the enzymatic reaction of the hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine at ph 8 in the presence of ache and the inhibitor studied is determined by
measuring at 230 nm the peak area of the reaction product thiocholine (tch). in the
method employed the capillary was first filled with 30 mm borate-phosphate buffer
(ph 8.0) and subsequently, plugs of: (i) water, (ii) ache solution, (iii) substrate solution with or without inhibitor, (iv) ache solution, and (v) water, were hydrodynamically injected into the capillary, and were allowed to stand (and react) during a waiting period of 2 min. the applicability of the proposed methodology to estimate
different kinetic parameters of interest such as inhibition constants ki, identification of inhibitory action mechanism and ic50, is evaluated using compounds with
known activity, tacrine  xxxd1968xxx , and neostigmine. the results obtained are
compared with bibliographic values and confirm the effectiveness of the methodology proposed. finally a method for ache inhibitor screening is proposed.

1 introduction
the use of compounds to inhibit enzyme action is an
important possibility for therapeutic intervention. many
drugs act by inhibiting specific enzymes which are associated with the disease process [1]. in this context, human
acetylcholinesterase (ache) is currently indicated as a
target enzyme for drugs to be used in the treatment of
alzheimer's disease (ad), the most common form of
dementia in the elderly. one important change observed
in the brain of ad patients is a decrease in hippocampal
and cortical levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine
(ach) by nearly 90%. this important decrease in ach levels causes impairment in cognitive function [2]. pharmacological treatment of ad is currently based on ache
inhibitors, such as tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, and
galantamine which maintain high levels of ach at the

muscarinic and nicotinic receptors in the central nervous system determining beneficial effects on cognitive,
functional, and behavioral symptoms of the disease [3].
however, the adverse side effect of these drugs, often due
to inhibition of peripheral ache, limits their use [4]. for
that reason, research on new inhibitors for the treatment
of ad with improved pharmacological properties is currently in progress.
preliminary studies in the discovery and development
process of new drugs include the in vitro evaluation of the
biological activity of the candidate compounds. for
enzyme inhibitor screening, the most common approach
is the measurement of the reduction of the enzyme activity in the presence of candidate compounds. for in vitro
screening ache inhibitors, the reaction of acetylthiocholine (athch, substrate) at ph 8 in the presence of ache
(enzyme) and the inhibitor to form acetic acid and thiocholine (tch, product of the enzymatic hydrolysis) is considered.
several procedures for the evaluation of ache activity
have been described. these include static procedures
such as the titration of the acid formed in the reaction
[5], the use of radiolabeled ach [6] or colorimetric methods using ellman's reagent [7]. the latter method is the
most widely used to measure the activity of ache and its

decrease in the presence of inhibitors. in this method a
yellow anion derived from the dithiobisnitrobenzoate
(ellman's reagent) when it reacts with tch is monitored
at 412 nm. chemiluminiscent assays based on coupled
enzymatic reactions have also been developed for the
evaluation of ache inhibitors [3, 8, 9].
dynamic procedures including chromatographic and
electrophoretic techniques using ache immobilized or
in dissolution have also been proposed for the evaluation
of ache inhibitors. a chromatographic procedure based
on in situ ache derivatized column has been used to
determine the inhibition potency (ic50) of known ache
inhibitors [10]. most recently, the authors developed an
immobilized human recombinant ache-based microenzyme reactor for inhibitor screening [11, 12]. this reactor
has been applied for the evaluation of the thermodynamic and kinetic constants, and the mechanism of
action of inhibitors [13]. moreover, an hplc-ms methodology was used for the screening of ache inhibitors in
natural extracts [14].
a recent trend in the area of enzyme assays is the use
of ce. ce has many advantages in this field due to the
small dimensions of the capillaries used for reaction and
separation, high efficiency separations, fast analysis
times, and the ability to employ several detection techniques [15]. measurement of enzyme activity by ce
include enzyme reaction prior ce analysis (precapillary
assay), enzyme reaction and consecutive on-capillary
detection of the product(s) (on-capillary assay), and
enzyme reaction after ce separation (post-capillary assay)
[16]. the second alternative, also known as electrophoretically mediated microanalysis (emma), is of particular
interest since the assay, and all its necessary operations,
completely occurs within the capillary. the emma
method has been successfully used with different
enzyme systems for enzyme activity assays, kinetic studies with determination of michaelis constants and study
of inhibitors. recently some reviews dealing with the
basic principle, methodology, variants, and applications
of emma have been published [15 – 18].
at present the plug – plug mode of emma, which relies
on a plug – plug interaction of reactants in the capillary,
is probably the most frequently used in the study of enzymatic reactions by ce. in the classical plug – plug mode,
after the introduction of enzyme and substrate as distinct plugs, the enzymatic reaction is initiated by the
application of an electric field since the zones interpenetrate due to the differences in their electrophoretic mobilities. one of the problems of this methodology, is the
high variability in peak areas of reagents and product of
enzymatic reaction due to slight variations in the incapillary contact period of the enzyme and substrate
plugs which affect the extent of the reaction [19].
as an alternative to the classical plug – plug mode the
at-inlet emma method has been proposed [19]. in this

modality, the consecutively injected enzyme and substrate plugs are mixed by simple diffusion and reacted
for a given time at the inlet part of the capillary. this variant is especially suitable for enzymes not resistant to an
electric field.
for the screening of ache inhibitors, the classical
plug – plug mode [20], as well as the use of an immobilized capillary ache reactor based on a layer-by-layer
assembly [21] has been proposed.
a general problem related with the use of dynamic
techniques, such as chromatography and electrophoresis, for the calculation of the inhibition kinetic parameters, inhibition constants, ki, and ic50 values, is the existence of diffusion phenomena during the enzymatic
reaction. as consequence, the actual concentrations of
substrate, enzyme and inhibitors are lower than the
injected concentrations and this affect considerably to
the estimated ki, and ic50 values [19].
the purpose of this study was the development of effective and reliable high-throughput screening (hts) procedure based on the at-inlet emma method for the screening and in vitro evaluation of the biological activity of
ache inhibitors that overcomes the limitations previously indicated.

2 materials and methods
2.1 instrumentation
an hp3d ce system (helwlett-packard, waldbronn, germany) equipped with an on-column diode array detector
(dad) and an hp3d ce chemstation software was used to
carry out all cze separations. a 50 lm inner diameter
(id) and 363 lm outer diameter (od) fused-silica capillary
with total and effective length of 56 and 47.5 cm, respectively was employed (agilent technologies, germany).
the capillary temperature was set at 378c and a running
voltage of 15 kv was used. detection was performed at
230 nm due to the maximum absorption of the substrate
and the reaction product. a crison micro-ph 2000 ph
meter from crison instruments (alella, barcelona, spain)
was employed to adjust the ph of the separation buffer.

2.2 chemicals and samples
all reagents were of analytical grade. ache from electrophorus electricus (ec.3.1.1.7), tacrine ( xxxd3270xxx  hydrochloride), neostigmine bromide,
 xxxd2940xxx ,  xxxd1968xxx  chloride, pyridostigmine bromide, and  xxxd123xxx  were purchased from sigma –
aldrich (steinheim, germany). athch chloride was
obtained from acros organics (geel, belgium), boric acid
 xxxd2534xxx  heptahydrate from scharlau (barcelona, spain), and sodium dihydrogen phosphate dehydrate from fluka (barcelona, spain).

all solutions were prepared by barnstead e-pure deionized water (sybron, boston, ma, usa) and filtered prior
to use through 0.45 lm pore size nylon membranes
(micron separation, westborough, ma, usa).

2.3 solution preparation
the running buffer in all emma experiments was 30 mm
borate-phosphate buffer at ph 8.0 and was prepared by
dissolving the appropriate amounts of boric acid and
sodium dihydrogen phosphate in water and adjusting
the ph with 1 m naoh. to prepare the working enzyme
solution ache was diluted to 115.2 u/ml with boratephosphate buffer. stock solutions of inhibitors
(5000 lm), substrate athch (100 mm),  xxxd2534xxx  (200 mm),
and  xxxd123xxx  used as an internal standard (50 mm)
were prepared in borate-phosphate buffer.
the assay solutions for kinetic and inhibitory studies
containing increasing inhibitor concentration, a concentration of substrate in the range of 2 – 20 mm, 20 mm
 xxxd2534xxx , and 2 mm  xxxd123xxx  were obtained by diluting
the stock solutions in borate-phosphate buffer.

2.4 procedures
new capillaries were conditioned for 10 min flush with
1 m naoh at 608c. then, they were rinsed for 5 min with
water and 15 min with borate-phosphate buffer at 378c.
in order to obtain good peak shapes and reproducible
migration times, the capillary was conditioned at the
beginning of each day with the following sequence: (i)
2 min rinse with deionized water, (ii) 2 min rinse with
1 m sodium hydroxide, (iii) 2 min rinse with deionized
water, and (iv) 5 min rinse with running buffer at
1000 mbar. between runs, the capillary was conditioned
with deionized water for 1 min, and running buffer for
2 min.

i

the enzyme solution and the substrate solution, with
or without inhibitor, were introduced into the inlet part
of the capillary by a sandwich injection mode (fig. 1), i.e.,
enzyme solution (50 mbar for 2 s)-substrate solution
(50 mbar for 2 s)-enzyme solution (50 mbar for 2 s).
before and after the sandwich injection mode a small
plug of water was injected hydrodynamically (20 mbar
for 2 s). the consecutively injected plugs were allowed to
stand during a predetermined waiting period. then, a
voltage of 15 kv was applied for the separation.

2.5 software and data processing
ache activity (initial reaction velocity) was determined
by the peak area of the product tch since the reaction
time was constant due to the identical lengths of the
enzyme and substrate plugs during all experiments. the
percentage of inhibition was calculated according to the
following equation:
 x

%inhibition ¼ 100 
100
ð1þ
blank
where x represents the peak area of the product (tch)
determined at a given concentration of inhibitor, and
the blank is the peak are of the product (tch) determined
without inhibitor being present.
the values of peak area of the product tch determined
in this study were averages of triplicate measurements.
microsoftm excel 2000 and statgraphics plus version 5.1
were used to perform the statistical analysis of the regressions.

uated as alternative to the classical plug – plug mode.
tacrine, a well-known ache inhibitor, was used for optimization. it has been reported in the literature that
ache displayed maximum activity in 30 mm boratephosphate buffer (ph 8) at 378c and in the presence of
20 mm of  xxxd2534xxx  [20]. therefore these conditions were
fixed and used for the enzyme reaction and for electrophoretic separation. the progress of the enzymatic reaction (fig. 1) was determined by measuring at 230 nm the
peak area of the product tch.
figure 1 shows a schematic illustration of the disposition used in this work for the at-inlet emma analysis. as
it was commented previously in the at-inlet emma analysis, unlike in the classical mode, the compounds were
not electrophoretically mixed prior to reaction. in the
method employed the capillary was first filled with
30 mm borate-phosphate buffer (ph 8.0). subsequently,
plugs of (i) water, (ii) ache solution, (iii) substrate solution with or without inhibitor, (iv) ache solution, and
finally (v) a plug of water were hydrodynamically
injected into the capillary, and were allowed to stand
(and react) during a waiting period. with the aim to control variations in the sandwich injection,  xxxd123xxx  was
introduced in the substrate solution as an internal standard.

injected enzyme and substrate plugs be mixed by simple
diffusion and react at the inlet part of the capillary was

3a, in absence of the inhibitor, the substrate is completely converted into tch (reaction product). however,
in presence of  xxxd1968xxx  (fig. 3b), the reaction is not
complete and the peak corresponding to the unreacted
substrate appears, whereas the product peak area diminwww.jss-journal.com

ishes. due to the low concentration of  xxxd1968xxx 
used, the peak of the inhibitor does not appear in the
electropherogram. as can be seen, no product peak splitting was observed that could be an indication of complete mixing [19].
in order to evaluate the dilution originated during the
mixing of the plugs and reaction process, the inhibitory
potency of tacrine using the at-inlet emma method developed was obtained. for this purpose assay solutions containing increasing inhibitor concentration in the range
of 10 – 3 – 103 lm in the presence of a fixed athch concentration (10 mm), and ache solution of 0.4 mg/ml were
prepared. figure 4 shows the inhibition curve for tacrine
obtained by plotting the %inhibition versus the logarithm
of inhibitor concentration in the assay solution injected.
as can be seen in fig. 4, complete inhibition was not
reached, even at high inhibitor concentrations. using

obtained using inline chromatographic and emma
methodologies were larger than those obtained with the

true value. this dilution factor was applied in all of the
subsequent calculations related with the at-inlet emma
method developed.

3.2 estimation of kinetic parameters
the applicability of the proposed methodology to estimate different kinetic parameters of interest such as
inhibition constants ki, identification of inhibitory
action mechanism and ic50, was evaluated using compounds with known activity, tacrine  xxxd1968xxx , and
neostigmine. since, the velocity of the enzymatic reaction is measured by the peak area of the formed tch, it is
important to guarantee that no other component coeluted with the product. table 2 shows the apparent
mobilities of substrate, product and some ache inhibi-

tors in the 30 mm borate-phosphate buffer (ph 8.0; 378c).
the apparent mobility was calculated from the migration time of the compound, taking into account the
capillary length and the applied voltage. as can be seen,
all the inhibitors had different apparent mobilities than
the product tch.
reversible inhibition can be described quantitatively
in terms of the inhibitor's binding to the enzyme (dissociation constant ki) and to the enzyme-substrate complex
(dissociation constant k9i ), and its effects on the kinetic
constants of the enzyme. in the presence of a reversible
inhibitor michaelis – menten equation can be described

in order to consider the dilution originated in the mixing process of the plugs during the at-inlet reaction, corrected concentrations for reagents (substrate, inhibitor,

for kinetic studies, two reversible reference inhibitors
with known potency and mechanism of action (tacrine
and  xxxd1968xxx ) were selected as model compounds.
to obtain estimates of the competitive inhibition constant, ki, michaelis – menten plots (v vs. [s]injected) and reciprocal plots (1/v vs. 1/[s]injected) were constructed by injecting
in triplicate different substrate solutions, in the range of
2 – 20 mm, containing increasing reversible inhibitor
concentrations, 0 – 10 and 0 – 100 lm for tacrine and

table 3 shows the estimated inhibition constants ki for

agreement with those reported in the literature obtained
using static procedures [13, 23, 24]. the use of other
dynamic methodologies provided higher and inaccurate
results.
mechanism of action was qualitatively evaluated by
comparing lineweaver – burk plot trend to the theoretical ones [1]. reciprocal plots for tacrine inhibition (fig.
5b) showed increase in slopes (decreased vmax) and
increase in intercepts (higher km) with higher inhibitor
concentration, indicating a mixed-type inhibition. in the
case of  xxxd1968xxx  inhibition (fig. 6b) unvaried vmax
and increasing x-intercepts (higher km) at increasing
inhibitor concentrations were obtained. this behavior
indicates that  xxxd1968xxx  acts as a pure competitive
ache inhibitor.
the results obtained were consistent with data
reported in the literature and well reflect the relative
potency of the inhibitors, suggesting that this assay
could be suitable for the first screening of new potential
ache inhibitors.

the inhibitory potency of  xxxd1968xxx  and neostigmine was also determined using the proposed at-inlet
emma method. for this purpose assay solutions containing increasing inhibitor concentration and a fixed substrate concentration of 10 mm were prepared and the
inhibition curves were obtained by plotting the %inhibition versus the logarithm of inhibitor concentration in
the assay solution injected in the electrophoretic system
(fig. 6). the ic50 values calculated from these curves were
0.68 and 1.06 lm for  xxxd1968xxx  and neostigmine,
respectively.

3.3 method for ache inhibitor screening
in order to obtain a rapid and efficient method for the
screening of new potential ache inhibitors a new procedure based on at-inlet emma analysis was evaluated. the
method for screening results used the methodology and
electrophoretic conditions previously optimized and
fixed concentrations of substrate; 10 mm, inhibitor,
10 lm, and ache, 0.4 mg/ml. table 4 shows the screening results, presented in terms of percentage of inhibition, obtained for five known ache inhibitors. according
to the results obtained, the order of inhibitory potency
was
tacrine >  xxxd1968xxx  > neostigmine >  xxxd2940xxx  >
pyridostigmine. the results obtained agree with the ki
values reported in bibliography for tacrine and  xxxd1968xxx  [13, 22 – 24]. for neostigmine, pyridostigmine, and
 xxxd2940xxx  no kinetic data have been found in the bibliography. the results obtained can be used as an automated
fast screening in the first step of the drug discovery process.

the developed procedure based on ce after enzymatic
reaction at capillary inlet proved to be useful for the
screening and in vitro evaluation of the biological activity
of ache inhibitors. the proposed method allows online
evaluation of kinetic parameters of interest such as determination the inhibitory constant (ki), identification of
mechanism of action and evaluation of ic50 values with
increased accuracy and reproducibility and with saving
of time and materials. the results obtained were found
in agreement with data reported in the literature.
the advantages over the static conventional methods
are the system automation which allows a large number
of compounds to be processed continuously. over the
dynamic procedures reported in bibliography, the proposed methodology corrects adequately the dilution
effects that take place in the columns/capillary providing
similar results compared to the reference/static procedures. due to the reduced analysis time, less than 5 min,
