abstract
gt-2331 [(1)-1] is one of the most potent members of a class of chiral
drug substances used to regulate the synthesis and release of histamine by the  xxxg1080xxx , and as such, is an important biomarker for pharmaceutical companies
conducting research in this field. in addition to overall structural features, the bioactivity
of this molecule has also been found to be highly dependent on absolute stereochemistry, making the reliable assignment of this property a necessity. x-ray diffraction studies
have provided conflicting data, leaving its three-dimensional structure uncertain. in view
of this, its absolute configuration was investigated by vibrational circular dichroism.
results from this study provided independent assignment of this important molecule as

introduction

the  xxxg1080xxx  was first described by
arrang et al. over 20 yr ago.1 this receptor functions as a
presynaptic autoreceptor,2 regulating the release and synthesis of histamine, which in turn modulates the release of
numerous other neurotransmitters that have been implicated in a wide range of disorders.3 as a result, a number
of laboratories have undertaken research programs that
have lead to the discovery of many potent and selective
h3 antagonists.4–10 one such agent, gt-2331 [(1)-1], is
one of the most potent h3 antagonists found to date.11
this chiral trans-cyclopropane is the dextrorotatory isomer
of 4-[2-(5,5-dimethyl-1-hexyn-1-yl)cyclopropyl]-1h-imidazole (scheme 1 (f)) and is 10 times more potent than its
levorotatory counterpart. the absolute stereochemistry of
(1)-1 was first reported as (1r,2r) based on results from
an x-ray diffraction (xrd) study of cyclopropyl-sultam
intermediates and the  xxxg1080xxx  affinities of
the cyclopropyl amine products synthesized from these
intermediates.12 more recently, the absolute configuration
of (1)-1 was re-examined, again by xrd. while investigating an improved synthesis, liu et al.13 conducted additional xrd experiments. in contrast to the initial assignment, results from the second study indicated that the
dextrorotatory isomer was more likely the (1s,2s)-enantiomer, leaving unresolved the absolute stereochemistry of
this important biomarker. on a broader note, these conflicting results highlight the growing need within the pharmaceutical industry for an independent ab initio technique
capable of determining absolute configurations of chiral
drug molecules. to compete successfully, this technique
must be highly reliable, robust, experimentally flexible,

capable of modestly high sample throughput, and able to
address a wide range of structural complexities. vibrational circular dichroism (vcd) is a chiroptical spectroscopic method meeting these requirements.
vcd is the extension of electronic cd (ecd) into the
infrared (ir) region of the electromagnetic spectrum and,
like ecd, is a form of differential absorption spectroscopy
arising from the preferential absorption of left and right
circularly polarized ir radiation by mirror-image stereoisomers (da 5 al 2 ar). fundamentally, vcd is well suited
for stereochemical analysis. the reason for this is simple.
the transitions taking place during vibrational excitation
typically occur 100–1000 times faster than most bond rotations, allowing the intrinsic three-dimensional structure of
a molecule to be determined from its vibrational spectrum.
by combining the conformational information inherent in
an ir absorption spectrum with the chiroptical specificity
exhibited by mirror-image stereoisomers, vcd is capable
of characterizing both a molecules absolute configuration
and its natural solution phase structure. although the first
observed vcd spectrum was reported over 30 yr ago,14–16
the technique remained an academic pursuit until the mid1990s when commercialization of ft-vcd instruments
combined with the development of density functional
theory (dft) made it possible to routinely measure
and accurately calculate vcd spectra.17–23 to date, vcd

analysis has been used to determine the absolute configurations of a wide range of chiral molecules, including drug
molecules of biomedical interest.24–31 surprisingly, acceptance of this technique by the pharmaceutical industry has
continued to be slow, which may be due at least in part to
the general loss of expertise in vibrational spectroscopy
within this industry.
following the initial x-ray report by khan et al.,12 (1)-1
and its mirror image isomer were synthesized at our facility for use as standards in evaluating the relative activities
of structurally related novel templates under investigation.
in view of the important relationship between the stereochemistry and bioactivities of these chiral molecules, a
vcd study was conducted to confirm the initial x-ray
assignment. results from this study conclusively demonstrated that the absolute configuration of (1)-1 was not
(1r,2r) as initially assigned, but instead (1s,2s), in agreement with the x-ray assignment reported at a later date by
lui et al.13 herein, we report the results of our original
vcd investigation to conclusively establish the absolute
stereochemistry of this important biomarker.

experimental methods

a racemic mixture of 4-[2-(5,5-dimethyl-1-hexyn-1-yl)cyclopropyl]-1h-imidazole was synthesized according to
scheme 1, adopted from ali et al.11 intermediate (a) was
prepared by the method described by burger et al.32 the
chirality doi 10.1002/chir

bulk racemate (scheme 1 (f)) was separated into purified
enantiomers by preparative supercritical fluid chromatography using a novasep c.20 system equipped with a chiral technologies’ chiralpak as column (20 3 250 mm,
10 lm particle size) and operating at 14 mpa pressure and
278c. isocratic mobile phase conditions were maintained
by flowing 40 g/min co2 and 4.5 ml/min of methanol containing 0.2% diethyl amine (v/v). ten milligrams of the racemate was dissolved in 500 ll of methanol and manually
injected. eluting peaks were detected at the wavelength of
215 nm at 4.5 and 6.0 min. analytical sfc indicated that
recovered samples were >98% pure with %ee >94%.
optical rotations were measured for both enantiomers
in methanol using a perkin–elmer model 241 polarimeter
equipped with a 1-dm cell. the sodium ‘‘d’’ line (589 nm)
was selected as the source. the specific rotations measured for the dextrorotatory and levorotatory isomers were
12518 and 22688, respectively, in good agreement with
reported data.13 as anticipated, the dextrorotatory isomer
was found to be the more potent enantiomer and thus
assigned as (1)-1.
vcd and ir spectra were acquired in the mid-ir region
(2000–800 cm21) using a chiralirtm vcd spectrometer
(bomem/biotools) equipped with a single photoelastic
modulator. spectra were acquired at 4 cm21 resolution
with a scan speed of 50 scans per minute. the unpolarized ir spectrum and accompanying vcd spectrum were
acquired for 12 and 120 min, respectively. samples were
dissolved in ccl4 at a concentration of 100 mg/ml and

 xxxg1080xxx  antagonist gt-2331

spectral measurements made using a sealed transmission
cell with baf2 windows, a 0.1-mm pathlength, and an internal volume of 75 ll.
the measured vcd spectra (vcdobs) were corrected
for baseline artifacts by subtracting the enantiomer spectra
from each other: [1/2]{[vcdobs (2)]2[vcdobs (1)]} and
[1/2]{[vcdobs (1)]-[vcdobs (2)]}. this approach was
used instead of the recommended procedure24 because it
did not require measurement of the racemate spectrum,
which was not possible in this case due to (1) limited sample quantities (10 mg), (2) the desire by the submitting
chemist to retrieve resolved samples after the analysis,
and (3) a demanding workload on the chromatographic
group responsible for chiral separations.
the computational analysis was carried out as follows.
global conformational searches were performed at the molecular mechanics level using the mmff94 force field
(pcmodel; serena software, bloomington, in). ab initio
molecular orbital calculations were performed using the
gaussian’03 (g03) program package.33 geometry optimizations and calculations of harmonic vibrational frequencies, dipole strengths (ir intensities), and rotational
strengths (vcd intensities) were carried out at the dft
level using the b3lyp functional with a 6-311g(d,p) basis
set. computed vibrational frequencies were scaled by a
uniform scaling factor of 0.975 to correct for anharmonicity
in measured data and limitations/errors in the electronic
structure calculations.34,35 calculated spectral line intensities were converted to lorentzian bands with 6 cm21
half-width-at-half-height. the contribution of each individual model to the overall conformational state was estimated using a boltzmann distribution of gas phase free
energies. composite vcd and ir spectra were synthesized by multiplying each model spectrum by its fractional
population and then summing together the individually
scaled spectra.36,37

results and discussion

the signal-to-noise spectra, measured and baseline-corrected vcd spectra, and ir spectra observed for (1)-1
and (2)-1 are shown in figure 1. the signal-to-noise spectra are uniform across the entire range, indicating that experimental vcd spectra are free of artifacts from electronic noise. the measured (uncorrected) vcd spectra
were included to demonstrate that the majority of bands in
the baseline-corrected vcd spectra have oppositely signed
bands observed in both spectra and are authentic vcd
bands. as indicated, bands near 1270 and 1180 cm21 do
not have oppositely signed counterparts in the mirrorimage spectrum and were identified as potential spectral
artifacts. in the lower panel of the figure, several minor differences are noted between the ir spectra. both spectra
contained a very weak band near 1740 cm21 and a broad
band centered near 1640 cm21. additionally, the ir spectrum of (2)-1 contained a broad band between 1050 and
1000 cm21 not observed for (1)-1. these bands were
attributed to the presence of (1) a small amount of carbonyl-containing impurity in both samples (1740), (2)

authentic vcd bands. two potential spectral artifacts (*) were identified
in the observed vcd spectra. small differences between the ir spectra
were attributed to low level impurities.

the weak intensities of these ir bands and the close qualitative agreement between calculated and observed vcd
spectra (vide infra), the presence of these minor impurities
did not influence the outcome of this stereochemical
study.
the vcd and ir spectra of (1)-1 are compared in figure 2 with spectra calculated for model 1 (scheme 2), a
full structure model of (1)-1 with (1s,2s) absolute configuration. the calculated spectra were synthesized from the
relative population ratios reported in table 1 for a set of
eight conformations of model 1. as indicated in this table,
the relative population of the lowest energy conformation
was estimated to be 80%, making the calculated spectra
heavily dependent upon a single conformation. in the
upper panel of figure 2, the vcd spectrum calculated for
model 1 is in good overall qualitative agreement with experimental, suggesting that the lowest energy gas phase
conformation is also dominant in solution. moreover, the
signs of the major vcd bands in the experimental spectrum are the same as those in the calculated spectrum,
supporting the assignment of (1)-1 as the (1s,2s)-enantiomer. the reliability of this assignment is weakened,
however, by the relatively poor agreement between the
calculated and experimental ir spectra compared in the
lower panel of the figure. here, the relative intensities of
bands near 1470 and 1365 cm21 in the experimental spectrum appear to be poorly reproduced in the calculated
spectrum. similarly, the series of 8–10 bands between
1150 and 850 cm21 in the observed ir spectrum is poorly
reproduced in the calculated spectrum. the majority of

work hereafter was spent improving the agreement
between ir data.
for a low molecular weight molecule like (1)-1, the 2,2dimethylbutyl group represents considerable mass and as
a result would be expected to produce a very strong
absorption band near 1470 cm21 (antisymmetric ch3 1
ch2 deformation modes), and a moderately intense
absorption band near 1395 cm21 and a strong band near
1365 cm21 (symmetric ch3 deformation modes of the tbutyl group). although the use of a calculated ir spectrum
whose features were largely determined by a single conformation (table 1) was considered as a possible cause for
the poor predictions of the intensities of these bands, ex-

scheme 2.
chirality doi 10.1002/chir

amination of individual ir spectra calculated for the eight
conformations in table 1 indicated that this was not the
cause. in each instance, the relative intensities of these
bands appeared to be underestimated, suggesting the
model chemistry employed in this study may not have provided accurate dipole strength estimates for these aliphatic
modes. while good qualitative agreement between calculated and observed ir spectra is an important aspect of
most well-executed ab initio vcd study, experimental and
computational data in this study indicated that 2,2-dimethylbutyl group is largely uncoupled from the chiral center
and thus contributes little to either the observed or calculated vcd spectrum. this is clearly shown in figure 3,
where the experimental ir spectrum of (1)-1 is compared
with its vcd spectrum. the five bands assigned in the ir
spectrum (*) correspond to the vibrational modes highly
characteristic for the 2,2-dimethylbutyl group: ch3 antisymmetric 1 ch2 bending modes (1473); two symmetric
ch3 deformation modes of t-butyl (1395 and 1363); c c
skeletal modes of t-butyl (1248 and 1215). the frequencies
of these bands have also been identified in the vcd spectrum. with one possible exception, the skeletal band near
1215 cm21, these ir bands clearly lie in regions of the
observed vcd spectrum where little or no absorption
occurs. for the band at 1215 cm21, second derivative data
(not shown) indicated that this band is an unresolved dou-

spectrum corresponding to the eight strongest vcd bands observed in

group contributes little to the observed vcd spectrum.

blet with a major component near 1215 cm21 and a minor
component at 1209 cm21, coincident with the minimum of
the negatively signed vcd peak. analysis of the vibrational modes predicted for model 1 indicated that the tbutyl skeletal mode would produce a moderate intensity
ir band but a weak vcd band near 1225 cm21, whereas
the symmetric ring stretching vibration of the cyclopropyl
ring coupled with an in-plane ch bending mode of the imidazole protons would produce a very weak ir band but a
moderately strong vcd band near 1205 cm21. these predictions were further supported by the analysis of reduced
structure h-bonded dimer models discussed later. in
short, both the experimental data in figure 3 and the computational data for model 1 (fig. 2) indicate the 2,2-dimethylbutyl group in (1)-1 is vibrationally uncoupled from
the chiral center, presumably because of conformational
averaging. regardless of the exact cause, the spectral data
in figure 3 for (1)-1 make it clear that the 2,2-dimethylbutyl group in this molecule contributes little to its vcd
spectrum, making accurate characterization of its ir features unnecessary.
one possible explanation for many of the additional differences between ir spectra in figure 2 is the ability of
neutral imidazole to form tautomers (scheme 3). the imidazole ring is known to exist only as the n1-h tautomer in
the solid state but as a tautomeric equilibrium of n1-h and
n3-h in solution.38–40 due to the importance of biogenic
histamine in living systems, a number of studies have
been conducted to identify vibrational marker bands diagnostic for each tautomer.41–43 the most reliable set of
marker bands is observed near 1600 cm21, and in the absence of additional aromatic groups in a molecule, bands
near 1594 and 1575 cm21 are highly diagnostic the n3-h
and n1-h tautomers, respectively.41–43 in the ir spectrum
of (1)-1 and its enantiomer (see fig. 1), a partially
resolved doublet is evident in this region with kmax at 1594
and 1574 cm21, leaving little doubt that both the n1-h and
n3-h tautomers are present under our experimental conditions. in view of this evidence, vcd and ir spectra were
calculated for a set of seven conformations of model 2, the

n3-h tautomer (scheme 3) using the fractional populations presented in table 2. the vcd and ir spectra calculated for this model are compared in figure 4 with spectral
data for model 1 and (1)-1. in the upper panel of this figure, the agreement between the vcd spectrum calculated
for model 2 and experimental is significantly poorer than
model 1, as expected since the n3-h tautomer is the
minor form.39,44,45 of note is the strong, negatively signed
vcd band near 1308 cm21 which is not present in the
vcd spectrum of model 1. a moderately intense shoulder
near this frequency in the experimental vcd spectrum
supports the presence of the n3-h tautomer under our experimental conditions.
in the lower panel of this figure, marker bands diagnostic for the two imidazole tautomers have been assigned in
both calculated ir spectra and identified in the experimental ir spectrum. the vibrational modes contributing most
significantly to these bands, assigned in table 3, are in
good agreement with assignments made for 4- xxxd16xxx  using normal coordinate analysis.42 as expected,
the c4c5 stretching vibration for model 2 is predicted at
higher frequency than model 1, allowing the high frequency shoulder near 1595 cm21 in the experimental data
to be reliably assigned to the c4c5 mode of n3-h and the

lower frequency band to this mode in n1-h and confirming the presence of both tautomers under our experimental conditions. three additional bands were identified in
the spectrum of model 2 between 1150 and 850 cm21 containing large contributions from imidazole ring vibrations
of the n3-h tautomer, explaining at least in part the complex series of bands in this region of the experimental ir
spectrum.
in an attempt to simulate spectra for the tautomeric mixture, the set of vcd and ir spectra predicted for all conformations of models 1 and 2 were combined initially
using boltzmann statistics. based on this approach, the
relative population of n1-tautomer was predicted to be 90–
95%, in agreement with literature results predicting a high
preference for this tautomer in the gas phase.44 the vcd
and ir spectra synthesized by this method are compared
in figure 5 with experimental data. given the high population of n1-h predicted by this approach, the simulated
vcd and ir spectra shown here closely resembled spectra
calculated for model 1 (fig. 2), as expected. in contrast to
the moderate intensity of the shoulder near 1595 cm21 in
the experimental ir spectrum, this band is too weak in the
boltzmann-derived ir spectrum in figure 5(b-2) to be
identified as a shoulder, suggesting the mole fraction of
n3-h was badly underestimated using gas phase free energies. as an alternative, mole fractions were estimated for
the tautomers empirically using the relative intensities of
bands at 1595 and 1575 cm21 in the experimental ir spectrum shown in figure 2. based on these intensities, the
mole fractions of n1-h and n3-h were estimated to be
0.65 and 0.35, respectively. although these solution phase
populations are significantly different from those predicted
by boltzmann statistics, they are in good agreement with
solution phase estimates reported in the literature: 0.6–
0.65 for n1-h; 0.4–0.35 for n3-h.39,45
using the empirically determined mole fractions, vcd
and ir spectra were simulated for a tautomeric mixture by
multiplying the intensity scales of the vcd and ir spectra
predicted for each tautomer by its fractional population
then combining the scaled spectra. the vcd and ir spectra predicted for a 65:35 mixture of models 1 and 2 are
included with the boltzmann data in figure 5. in the upper
panel, the overall qualitative agreement between the vcd
chirality doi 10.1002/chir

spectrum predicted for the 65:35 tautomer mixture and experimental is unimproved over the boltzmann-derived
vcd spectrum, except for the negatively signed shoulder
near 1310 cm21 which may be diagnostic for the n3-h tautomer, as previously discussed. the intensity of this band
appears to be overestimated, however, suggesting a mole
fraction of 0.35 for the n3-h tautomer is too high. in contrast to the vcd comparison, qualitative agreement
between the ir spectrum predicted for the tautomeric mixture and experimental appears to be modestly improved
over the boltzmann-derived ir spectrum, allowing bands
near 1110, 1020, and 920 cm21 in the experimental ir
spectrum to be tentatively assigned to the n1-h and n3-h
tautomers. despite these small improvements, however, it
was still not possible to assign experimental ir bands near
1085, 1045, and 960 cm21.
in addition to tautomerizing, imidazoles also form very
strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds (h-bonds) in ccl4,
which persist even at very high dilution (1024 m).46 in

study (0.46 m in ccl4), extensive h-bonding between imidazole rings would be expected, causing large anharmonic shifts in the vibrational frequencies of imidazole
ring stretching and bending modes as well as nh bending
modes that would not be addressed by a computational
analysis based only on monomers like models 1 and 2.
the best method for determining the extent of h-bonding
would have been to conduct a simple concentration-dependent ir absorption study of nh stretching between 3650
and 2300 cm21, including measurement of the vcd solution. these experimental data were not acquired in our
study, however, for the following reasons. first, the scan
range of our vcd spectrometer is limited to 2000–800
cm21, requiring independent measurement of the high frequency range when h-bonding information is required.
more importantly in this case, agreement between calculated and observed vcd data in the 2000–800 cm21 was
considered to be good enough at the time of the analysis
(2002) to make a reliable assignment. sample reserves
have long since been exhausted, not allowing this piece of
experimental data to be obtained at a later date.
as an alternative to experimentally determined data,
intermolecular h-bonding was examined in silico using
the reduced structure h-bonded dimer models shown in
scheme 4. reduced structure models were used instead of
full structure dimer models so that calculations could carry
out at the higher b3lyp/6-311g(d,p) level of theory at a
reasonable computational cost. as discussed (fig. 3), experimental and computational data indicated that the 2,2dimethylbutyl group played an insignificant role in the
absorption characteristics of the experimental vcd spectrum, allowing this bulky group to be replaced by methyl.
simulation of a tautomeric mixture of h-bonded dimers in
solution was accomplished as follows. ir and vcd spectra
were independently calculated for models 3-a and 3-b.
these spectra were then combined using the mole fractions of each tautomer estimated from the experimental
data (0.65 for model 3-a and 0.35 for model 3-b) to simulate a mixture of h-bonded tautomers. while this approach
is clearly simplistic, it provided good evidence that the
observed ir spectrum (but not the vcd spectrum) is
highly dependent on both h-bonding and tautomerization.

the vcd and ir spectra calculated for the tautomer
mixture of h-bonded dimers are compared in figure 6
with experimental data. the vcd spectrum calculated for
the mixture of dimers is in excellent agreement with experimental. anharmonicities ranged from <3 cm21 in the
best case to 20 cm21 in the worst, with most variations
in frequencies ranging from 4 to 8 cm21, assuring the reliable assignment of bands in vcd data. only the 1220–
1190 cm21 and 900–850 cm21 regions of the experimental
vcd spectrum now appear to be poorly predicted by the
model spectrum. although the exact reasons for these differences are unclear, further improvements could likely be
made using a combination of monomer models and hbonded dimer models. given the high level of agreement
otherwise noted, however, this addition work was not
undertaken.

data is much improved over the calculated data shown for
either model 1 in figure 2 or the mixture of n1-h and
n3-h tautomers in figure 5. all major bands observed
between 1200 and 850 cm21 are now accounted for in the
calculated spectrum, with the single exception of the experimental ir band near 1040 cm21. examination of vibrational modes for the peak at 1068 cm21 in the calculated
spectrum indicated that it is an unresolved doublet with
maxima near 1071 and 1063 cm21. these modes correspond to fundamentals 64 and 63 in model 3a and involve
n1c5 ring stretching vibrations, with the higher frequency
mode assigned to the donor ring and the lower frequency
mode to the acceptor ring. it is possible that the separation
of these bands is wider in the observed spectrum than predicted. alternatively, this experimental band may be diagnostic for h-bonded dimers composed of both n1-h and
n3-h tautomers (mixed h-bonded dimers). in addition to
the band at 1068 cm21, the intensities of several other

bands in the 1150–850 cm21 of the calculated spectrum
are overestimated. comparison of this region with ir spectra calculated for the monomers (figs. 2 and 5) suggests
again that agreement with the experimental ir spectrum
could be further improved using a combination of monomer and h-bonded dimer models. it would be incorrect to
conclude from the data in figure 6 that (1)-1 is present in
solution only as an h-bonded dimer. in contrast, published
data46 would suggest that it is more likely present as a
complex h-bonded polymer, further complicated by the
presence of monomers and a mixture of both tautomers.
given the simple approach used to model a very complex
solution, however, the qualitative agreement between calculated and experimental ir data between 1150 and 900
cm21 is surprisingly close, demonstrating that h-bonding
and, to a lesser extent, tautomerization are both responsible for complicating the ir spectrum of a relatively simple
molecule.
in figure 7, the vcd spectrum calculated for the mixture of dimer models 3-a and 3-b (scheme 5) are compared with the vcd spectra of both (1)-1 and (2)-1.
based on these data, the structures in scheme 5 were
assigned. the excellent agreement between these vcd
spectra leave no doubt that the more potent dextrorotatory
isomer, (1)-1, is the (1s,2s)-enantiomer and the less
potent levorotatory isomer, (2)-1, is the (1r,2r)-enantiomer, confirming the xrd assignments made by lui
et al.13

conclusion

the absolute configurations of the dextrorotatory and
levorotatory isomers of  xxxd2296xxx  (scheme 1) have
been assigned by ab initio vcd analysis. these configurational assignments were significant for two reasons. first,
the dextrorotatory isomer, (1)-1, is one of the most potent
 xxxg1080xxx  antagonist yet discovered, and as
such, serves as an important biomarker for assessing the
efficacies of novel templates in h3 receptor assays. the
unambiguous assignment of its absolute configuration is

scheme 5.
chirality doi 10.1002/chir

 xxxg1080xxx  antagonist gt-2331

of major importance to these pharmacological studies.
second, conflicting x-ray assignments have been reported
for (1)-1, leaving its absolute configuration in question. in
this study, ab initio vcd analysis played a central role in
elucidating the three-dimensional structure of this important biomarker, illustrating more generally that vcd is not
simply an adjunct to xrd, but a fully independent partner
in investigations of absolute stereochemistry. furthermore, this study illustrates the challenges often encountered during vcd studies, even ones involving structurally
simple molecules, as in this case. factors like tautomerism
and hydrogen bonding must be well understood to accurately predict the observed vcd and ir spectra can be
accurately characterized by modeling.
results from our study demonstrate conclusively, we
believe, that the highly potent dextrorotatory isomer, (1)1, is the (1s,2s)-enantiomer. the high level of confidence
placed in this assignment was achieved only after the
structural properties of this molecule and its solution
phase behavior were better understood. this was accomplished using experimental data and reduced structure
models to elucidate the minor role played by the 2,2-dimethylbutyl group in the chiroptical properties of (1)-1 and
multiple models to gain a better understanding of the complex solution phase structure of this molecule. the use of
reduced structure models in this study illustrates the general use of fragment models as substitutes for full models
in vcd investigations of structural complex large molecules, which can provide an accurate description of their
vcd spectra but not their ir spectra. an often overlooked
advantage of reduced structure modeling is the ability to
perform calculations with higher level basis sets then possible for full structure models, thereby increasing the accuracy of the model vcd spectrum. on a final note, our
results suggest that the population ratios used to scale calculated vcd and ir spectra for a set of tautomers may be
better estimated from experimental data instead of gas
phase free energies and boltzmann statistics.
