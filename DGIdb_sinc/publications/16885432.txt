abstract
2-[(diphenylmethyl) sulfinyl] xxxd63xxx  (modafinil), prescribed
principally to treat narcolepsy, is undergoing assessment for
other neuropsychiatric disorders and medical conditions. the
neurochemical substrates of modafinil are unresolved. we postulated that modafinil enhances wakefulness by modulating
dopamine (dat), norepinephrine (net), or serotonin (sert)
transporter activities. in vivo, we determined dat and net
occupancy by modafinil by positron emission tomography imaging; in vitro, we determined modafinil activity at the dat,
net, sert, and rhesus monkey  xxxg2239xxx  ( xxxg2239xxx ).
in rhesus monkey, modafinil occupancy of striatal dat was
detected by [11c]2␤-carbomethoxy-3␤-4-(fluorophenyl)tropane
and of thalamic net by [11c](s,s)-2-(␣-(2-methoxyphenoxy)benzyl)morpholine. in vitro, modafinil effects in dat-human

investigated alone or combined with the  xxxg2239xxx  receptor. modafinil (i.v.) occupied striatal dat sites (5 mg/kg: 35 ⫾ 12%, n ⫽ 4;
8 mg/kg: 54 ⫾ 3%, n ⫽ 3). in thalamus, modafinil occupied net
sites (5 mg/kg: 16 ⫾ 7.8%, n ⫽ 6; 8 mg/kg: 44 ⫾ 12%; n ⫽ 2).
in vitro, modafinil inhibited [3h]dopamine (ic50 ⫽ 6.4 ␮m),
[3h]norepinephrine (ic50 ⫽ 35.6 ␮m), and [3h]serotonin (ic50 ⬎
500 ␮m) transport via the human dat, net, and sert. modafinil did not activate the  xxxg2239xxx  receptor in  xxxg2239xxx -hek cells, but it
augmented a  xxxg2099xxx -dependent enhancement
of phenethylamine activation of  xxxg2239xxx  in  xxxg2239xxx -dat and  xxxg2239xxx -net
cells, but not in  xxxg2239xxx -sert cells. the present data provide
compelling evidence that modafinil occupies the dat and net
in living brain of rhesus monkeys and raise the possibility that
modafinil affects wakefulness by interacting with catecholamine transporters in brain.

it is also undergoing clinical trials in an expanding range of
psychiatric, neurological, and medical illnesses, including
cocaine addiction (dackis and o’brien, 2003; vocci and ling,
2005; sofuoglu and kosten, 2006) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (biederman et al., 2005). notwithstanding the expanding clinical indications for modafinil, the
neurochemical mechanisms that produce therapeutic improvement remain unresolved. this void is particularly relevant for cocaine addiction, because clarity on the underlying
mechanisms may yield important leads for candidate therapeutics.

enhanced when the dat is also present (miller et al., 2005).
in this regard,  xxxg2239xxx  activity may be affected by modafinil,
because dat enhances  xxxg2239xxx  activation by pea (miller et al.,
2005). modafinil did not act as a direct agonist at  xxxg2239xxx , nor
did it significantly affect pea stimulation of  xxxg2239xxx  in transfected hek cells lacking monoamine transporters. modafinil
did, however, augment the enhancement of pea activation of
 xxxg2239xxx  in the presence of dat or net, indicating a potential
indirect contribution of  xxxg2239xxx  receptors with regard to modafinil action that warrants further investigation. accordingly,
we provide evidence that modafinil-induced wakefulness is
partially attributable to dat and net occupancy in the
brain, resultant from a cascade of events associated with
functional catecholamine transporters.

materials and methods
pet imaging of the dopamine and norepinephrine transporter. adult female (n ⫽ 4) and male (n ⫽ 1) rhesus monkeys
(macaca mulatta) were used for pet imaging procedures. animal
care and treatment were supervised by veterinarians under the
guidelines and in accordance with guide for the care and use of
laboratory animals (institute of laboratory animal resources,
commission on life sciences, national research council, national
academy press, washington, dc, 1996). the animal care protocol
was approved by the harvard animal care committee and was in
compliance with the harvard medical school animal management
program, an institution accredited by the american association for
the accreditation of laboratory animal care.
pet imaging of the dat in caudate putamen was used to determine dat occupancy by modafinil. dat was quantified with the
selective dat probe [11c]cft (kaufman and madras, 1991; hantraye et al., 1992; morris et al., 1996; madras et al., 1998; saka et al.,
2004). pet imaging was conducted with monkeys initially anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (15.0/1.5 mg/kg) and then maintained
under general anesthesia with halothane. monkeys were positioned
on the imaging bed of a pc 4096 pet camera (ge/skanditron ab,
uppsala, sweden). a stereotactic head-holder was used for head
immobilization. cft was demethylated in the c-2 position, and
[11c]methyl was inserted by the methyl iodide reaction. after stabilization in the pet camera, ⬃10 mci of [11c]cft (specific activity
⬎1500 mci/␮mol) was injected through the venous catheter and
sequential images were acquired in 15-s time frames for the first 2
min and in 1-min frames for 58 min. dat or net occupancy was
measured by administering modafinil i.v. 1 h after baseline image
acquisition was completed and then reintroducing radioligand via an
i.v. indwelling catheter 1 h later. parallel studies were conducted
with the net probe [11c]mener. at the conclusion of each imaging
study, the emission and transmission images were reconstructed
using a conventional filtered back-projection algorithm to an inplane resolution of 6-mm full-width half-maximum. all projection
data were corrected for nonuniformity of detector response, dead
time, random coincidences, and scattered radiation. a sum image
was generated by adding all of the frames from frame 10 to the end
of the study. regions of interest were drawn on the summed image in
the coronal projection as follows: one 4-pixel region was drawn on
each caudate putamen on the slice of maximal intensity. for cerebellum, three 4-pixel regions were drawn at various levels on cerebellar slices. time-activity data were produced using the regions of
interest on all time frames of the pet data. the same set of regions
of interest was used to analyze each scan for an individual subject on
the same day. when necessary, new regions were drawn to compensate for repositioning. binding potential was calculated by published
methods. parallel experiments were conducted with the pet ligand
[11c]mener (schou et al., 2004; ghose et al., 2005) to image the
net in the thalamus and monitor modafinil occupancy.

(lafon, 1979), all of which are characteristics of hyperdopaminergic activity. thereafter, several investigators questioned
the contribution of dopamine neurotransmission to modafinil
pharmacology, on the basis of overlapping, but not identical
behavioral and neurochemical responses of modafinil compared with amphetamine, a psychomotor stimulant with robust dopaminergic effects (duteil et al., 1990; akaoka et al.,
1991; simon et al., 1995; lin et al., 1996; ferraro et al.,
1997a,b; engber et al., 1998; engele, 1998). modafinil was a
weak inhibitor of the dat (⬎1 ␮m affinity) and displayed no
affinity for dopamine receptor subtypes (mignot et al., 1994;
bryan roth, personal communication). enhancement of glutamate release and inhibition of gaba release in various
brain regions were proposed as alternative modes of action
(ferraro et al., 1997a,b, 1999).
notwithstanding these important observations, accumulating behavioral and biochemical evidence converge on dopaminergic and noradrenergic mechanisms as plausible contributors to modafinil pharmacology (wisor et al., 2001;
boutrel and koob, 2004; wisor and eriksson, 2005). modafinil engenders behavioral effects consistent with enhanced
dopamine transmission, because it increases motor activity
in normal or parkinsonian monkeys (jenner et al., 2000; van
vliet et al., 2006), partially generalizes to a cocaine-like
discriminative stimulus in rodents, and serves as a reinforcer
at high doses in monkeys or human subjects (gold and balster, 1996; but see deroche-gamonet et al., 2002; stoops et
al., 2005). modafinil also increases striatal dopamine efflux
as effectively as amphetamine in dog brain, with dose ratios
comparable with clinical dose ratios. significantly, the wakepromoting effects of modafinil are abolished in dat null
mutant mice (wisor et al., 2001).
the rapid expansion of new therapeutic indications for
modafinil, in the face of unexplained mechanisms, creates an
exigency to clarify modafinil pharmacology. on the basis of
modafinil-induced dopamine efflux and the dat dependence
for the wake-promoting effects of the drug (wisor et al.,
2001), we postulate that modafinil modulation of the dat (or
net) contributes to enhanced wakefulness and therapeutic
benefit. this hypothesis is predicated on whether modafinil
occupies the dat or net in living brain, an objective that, to
our knowledge, has not been addressed. we used pet imaging of the dat ([11c]cft) and of the net with [11c]mener
(madras et al., 1989, 2001; morris et al., 1996; schou et al.,
2003; spencer et al., 2006) to investigate whether modafinil
binds to these transporters in living brain. pet imaging
revealed that therapeutic doses of modafinil occupied dat
and net sites in vivo, leading us to investigate the in vitro
pharmacology of modafinil at monoamine transporters. in
vitro, we measured modafinil potencies for inhibiting transport of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin by the human dat, net, and sert. modafinil inhibited dopamine
and norepinephrine transport by the dat and net, respectively, in agreement with the dat-dependent increase in
extracellular dopamine levels elicited by modafinil administration.
the trace amine pea promotes dopamine release via the
dat (sotnikova et al., 2004), an effect potentially linked to
its activation of the  xxxg2239xxx  ( xxxg2239xxx ; borowsky et
al., 2001; bunzow et al., 2001; miller et al., 2005). pea is also
a potent agonist at  xxxg2239xxx , and our previous in vitro work has
demonstrated that the response of  xxxg2239xxx  to pea is greatly

concentrations for 18 h at incubation conditions.  xxxg2099xxx  inhibitors, when used, were applied to the cells at 15 min
before the drug treatment. cell lysates were prepared by adding 100
␮l of lysis buffer into each well and shaking on a rotator platform for
30 min at 25°c. then, 20 ␮l of each cell lysate was transferred into
a 96-well microplate for determination of luciferase concentration.
luciferase assay substrate reagents (25 ␮l) were injected into each
sample well, and after a 2-s delay, luciferase concentration was
measured as relative light units (rlus) for 12 s at wallac 1420
multilabel counter-victor 3v (perkinelmer life and analytical sciences, shelton, ct). the experiments were performed three times in
triplicate for each concentration of the drug treatment. percentage of
rlu increase was calculated from the ratio of firefly to renilla
luciferase in cell lysates. to assess the effect of  xxxg2099xxx  blockers on  xxxg2239xxx  in cells that coexpress a  xxxg2099xxx , we defined the enhancement of  xxxg2239xxx  activation as the percentage of increase of rlu in  xxxg2239xxx -tranfected dat, net, or sert
cells subtracted by the percentage of increase of rlu in  xxxg2239xxx -transfected hek293 cells.

results
pet imaging: dat and net occupancy by modafinil. to investigate whether clinically relevant doses of
modafinil accumulate at the dat, we labeled the dat with
the pet imaging probe [11c]cft or win 35,428 (madras et
al., 1989; morris et al., 1996). [11c]mener was used to label
the net (schou et al., 2004). in a double-injection study,
rhesus monkeys were scanned to obtain baseline measures of
dat or net binding potential. after decay of [11c]cft or
[11c]mener, monkeys were injected i.v. with 2, 5, or 8 mg/kg
modafinil, and pet imaging was repeated 1 h later (table 1).
dat occupancy was insignificant with 2 mg/kg modafinil
(n ⫽ 1), but 5 mg/kg modafinil occupied 35 ⫾ 11.9% of dat
sites (n ⫽ 4), and 8 mg/kg modafinil occupied 53 ⫾ 3% (n ⫽
3) of dat sites in striatum (figs. 1, left, and 2; table 1).
modafinil (8 mg/kg) occupancy of the dat (fig. 2) or the net
(fig. 3) was observable within 60 min after administration.
to verify that modafinil occupancy occurred regardless of the
dat probe, a single parallel experiment was performed with
the dat probe [11c]altropane (fischman et al., 2001). again,
8 mg/kg modafinil occupied 67% of dat sites, indicating that
dat occupancy by modafinil was not an artifact of the pet
probe. for comparative purposes, a parallel study was conducted with methylphenidate, again at a clinically relevant
dose (0.3 mg/kg). methylphenidate occupied comparable levels of dat at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg (table 1).
the net also accumulated modafinil (figs. 1, right, and 3),
with a 5-mg/kg dose occupying 16 ⫾ 7.6% of net sites (n ⫽

dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporter assays. the generation of stable human dat-, net-, and serttransfected hek293 cells has been described previously (goulet et
al., 2001; yatin et al., 2001; verrico et al., 2005). assays to measure
drug inhibition of [3h]monoamine transport were performed to determine ic50 values, as described previously (miller et al., 2001;
verrico et al., 2005). cells were grown to 70 to 85% confluence in
biocoat 24-well tissue culture plates coated with polylysine. the
medium was removed by aspiration, and cells were washed with
ice-cold assay buffer: tris–hepes, ph 7.4, at 25°c containing 4 mm
 xxxd3449xxx , 8.5 mm hepes, 120 mm nacl, 5.4 mm kcl, 1.2 mm
cacl2, 1.2 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 10 mm glucose, 100 ␮m  xxxd228xxx , and
100 ␮m tropolone. cells were harvested by pipetting the medium for
cell detachment and resuspended in the assay buffer at approximately 3 ⫻ 105/ml. each assay tube contained ⬃1.5 ⫻ 105 cells,
[3h]da, [3h]norepinephrine, or [3h]5-hydroxytryptamine and various concentrations of unlabeled inhibitors in a total of 0.4 ml of
solution. uptake activities were initiated by transferring the tubes
from ice to 37°c water bath and terminated 3 or 10 min later by
transferring the tubes to ice. each experiment was performed in
triplicate and repeated three to six times. all experiments were
conducted in darkness. nonspecific monoamine transport was measured with 10 ␮m  xxxd2546xxx  for dat, 10 ␮m nisoxetine for net, or
10 ␮m fluoxetine for sert. in competition experiments, 0.2 ml of
drug was added for a 10-min preincubation period. monoamine
transport was initiated by the addition of [3h]monoamine combined
with various concentrations of unlabeled monoamine to achieve an
appropriate specific activity (sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo). the
assay was terminated by aspiration. the plate was placed on ice and
rinsed three times with cold (4°c) uptake assay buffer. after the final
wash was aspirated, 0.5 ml of 1.0% sds was added to each well.
after 20 min of gentle shaking, 0.25 ml was removed from each well,
and radioactivity was measured for 5 min in vials containing 4 ml of
readysafe scintillation fluid. ic50 values were obtained by nonlinear
curve fitting using prism version 3.0 (graphpad software inc., san
diego, ca).
rhesus  xxxg2239xxx  activity, as determined by dual-luciferase
reporter assay. stable dat, net, and sert cells were placed in
48-well plates 2 days before transfection. transfections were performed on 70 to 80% confluent cells as described previously (miller et
al., 2005; xie et al., 2005). in total, three vectors were cotransfected:
1) a camp-response element (cre)-driven firefly luciferase reporter
construct, ptlnc121-3 (from dr. walter borne, university of zurich, zurich, switzerland), which contains a 21⫻cre cassette positioned upstream from a tata box minimal promoter element, as a
highly sensitive and quantitative reporter of total camp accumulation; 2) an optimized renilla luciferase construct,  xxxg2040xxx .73 (promega, madison, wi), which is unresponsive to increases in cellular
camp (g. m. miller, unpublished data), to control for transfection
efficiency and experimental variability; and 3) either a  xxxg2239xxx  expression vector (miller et al., 2005) or pcdna3.1(⫹) (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) to control for total dna amounts used in transfections.
transfections into different cell lines were performed simultaneously
for each experiment. dual-luciferase assay (promega) was performed
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cells were incubated with
transfection solution for 12 h and then exposed to drugs at different

compared with baseline levels of accumulation (left). data are summarized in table 1 and fig. 1.

of the dat was twice as high as the net (fig. 1, right; table
1). these data provided a strong impetus to investigate
modafinil effects on dat and net in vitro.
modafinil inhibition of dat, net, and sert. we
measured modafinil affinity for the dat in radioligand binding assays and for dat, net, and sert in transport assays.
because modafinil is weakly soluble in aqueous media, we
were cognizant of the potential confound of solvent interference with transport binding or activity assays. pilot radioligand binding assays demonstrated that at certain concentrations, solvents ( xxxd1896xxx  or ethanol/hcl)
significantly affected dat and net binding assays, and
assignment of the relative contributions of solvent and
modafinil to the data were not possible. solvent levels were
adjusted accordingly to prevent this confound. in competition
studies with [3h]cft (dat), modafinil affinity was relatively modest (ic50 ⫽ 4360 nm; table 2) and corresponded to
its potency for inhibiting [3h]dopamine transport (ic50 ⫽
6390 ⫾ 2050 nm; fig. 4). modafinil was a weak inhibitor of
[3h]norepinephrine or [3h]dopamine transport by the net
(table 2; fig. 5). modafinil potency for blocking [3h]serotonin
transport was low, with an ic50 value ⬎500 ␮m (table 2).
with the exception of bupropion, modafinil potency was at
least 10-fold lower in comparison with other therapeutic
drugs that elicit pharmacological responses partly via the
dat (table 2). compared with modafinil, methylphenidate
was 100-fold more potent at blocking [3h]dopamine transport
by the dat, and benztropine was 30- and 10-fold more potent.
modafinil effects on  xxxg2239xxx  alone or with dat, net, or
sert. we investigated the effects of modafinil on  xxxg2239xxx  because modafinil blocks [3h]dopamine transport, and datmediated dopamine release is facilitated by  xxxg2239xxx  (sotnikova
et al., 2004). we initially monitored whether modafinil modulated cre-luc expression mediated by  xxxg2239xxx . in hek293
cells transfected with the reporter constructs, there was no
dose-response effect of modafinil with or without  xxxg2239xxx , with
only extremely small elevations in cre-luc activation detected in the presence of modafinil (fig. 6a).
pea is an agonist at  xxxg2239xxx  and is an effective substrate for
dat (miller et al., 2005; b. k. madras, a. k. jassen, z. lin,
h. panas, t. j. spencer, g. m. miller, and a. j. fischman,
unpublished data). we determine whether modafinil alters
pea activation of  xxxg2239xxx  indirectly, by blocking dat, net, or
sert function. we postulated this may occur as a population
of  xxxg2239xxx  is localized intracellularly, based on immunohistochemical localization of the receptor in vitro (bunzow et al.,
2001; miller et al., 2005). indirect evidence also points to an

approximately) was added, and cells were incubated for 10 min at 25°c,
as described under materials and methods.

intracellular localization of  xxxg2239xxx  in vitro, because  xxxg2239xxx  activation by pea is markedly enhanced in dat- xxxg2239xxx -expressing cells (miller et al., 2005). to determine whether modafinil
could modify  xxxg2239xxx  activity via monoamine transporters, albeit in vitro, various concentrations of modafinil were incubated with cells coexpressing dat- xxxg2239xxx , net- xxxg2239xxx , or sertta1. modafinil augmented  xxxg2239xxx  activity in the presence of
dat only at 100 ␮m, but not net or sert (fig. 6b). because the three cell lines share an identical hek293 background, the response is mediated by the dat. accordingly,
modafinil does not directly activate  xxxg2239xxx  receptors at doses
below 100 ␮m.

discussion
modafinil is widely used to treat narcolepsy (banerjee et
al., 2004), and it is undergoing clinical trials as a therapeutic
for a wide range of psychiatric, neurological, and medical
illnesses. these include cocaine addiction (dackis and
o’brien, 2003; vocci and ling, 2005), parkinson’s disease
(serrano and garcia-borreguero, 2004), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (biederman et al., 2005), depression
(price and taylor, 2005), cancer, and multiple sclerosis-related fatigue (morrow et al., 2005) and opioid-induced sedation in chronic pain (reissig and rybarczyk, 2005). the rapid
expansion of these presumptive clinical indications for
modafinil is empirically driven, because no broad consensus
exists on the underlying mechanisms of modafinil pharmacology. we now provide compelling evidence that modafinil
occupies the dat and net in living brain of rhesus monkeys
at doses that are presumably clinically relevant. occupancy
was comparable with dat occupancy by the attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder medication methylphenidate, also administered at a therapeutic dose. the clinical significance of
this discovery is supported by in vitro data, because modafinil blocked 50% of dat-mediated dopamine transport in
vitro at a lower concentration than the plasma concentrations of modafinil estimated in human subjects within 2 h
after a modest dose (200 mg) of the drug (wong et al., 1999).
accordingly, clinically relevant doses (400 – 600 mg) of
modafinil conceivably achieve brain concentrations sufficient
to bind to dat and net, notwithstanding the caveats of 1)
extrapolating modafinil plasma levels to brain extracellular
concentrations, 2) extrapolating in vitro to in vivo transporter affinities, 3) potential differences in the pharmacokinetic and metabolic properties of modafinil in humans and
nonhuman primates, and 4) a similarity in plasma levels that

modafinil effects on pea activation of  xxxg2239xxx  alone or
with dat, net, or sert. pea activation of  xxxg2239xxx  is dosedependent and is robustly enhanced by either dat, net, or
sert coexpression in vitro (fig. 7). the enhancement of pea
activation of  xxxg2239xxx  in the presence of dat, net, or sert is
blocked by pretreatment with the transporter inhibitors
methylphenidate, desipramine, and citalopram, respectively,
at a dose of 10 ␮m (fig. 7). in the absence of monoamine
transporters, modafinil (10⫺9–10⫺4 mol/l) had no effect on
pea activation of  xxxg2239xxx  (fig. 8a, left top). we tested a single
dose of modafinil, 10 ␮m, and found that it was able to
augment the enhancement of pea activation of  xxxg2239xxx  in the
presence of dat (fig. 8b, right top) or net (fig. 8c, left
bottom), but there was no augmentation of the enhancement
of pea activation of  xxxg2239xxx  in the presence of sert.

results from i.v. modafinil in rhesus monkeys compared with
oral modafinil in humans. if our data are confirmed in human subjects by pet imaging, we surmise that modafinil is
a modulator of dat and/or net function in various brain
regions, a process that conceivably contributes to enhanced
wakefulness and possibly other therapeutic effects of the
drug.
although initial observations of modafinil pharmacology
were consistent with drug-induced enhancement of dopamine activity, the contribution of dopamine neurotransmission to modafinil pharmacology has been repeatedly questioned, on the basis of nuances of neurochemical or
behavioral data and in vitro dat affinity. in particular,
dopaminergic contributions were mitigated by evidence of
contrasting amphetamine and modafinil pharmacology,
brain activation patterns, and the failure of dopamine receptor antagonists to attenuate modafinil-mediated behavioral
effects (duteil et al., 1990; akaoka et al., 1991; mignot et al.,
1994; simon et al., 1995; lin et al., 1996; ferraro et al.,
1997a,b; engber et al., 1998). although these differences may
be attributable to contrasting doses, potencies, and the spec-

trum of molecular targets and affinities for various receptors
and transporters in brain, they do not exclude dopaminergic
mechanisms for both drugs.
a functional interaction between dat and modafinil has
been discounted, because of low modafinil affinity for dat
(mignot et al., 1994). this is an insufficient reason to disregard the dat, because relatively high doses of modafinil
ranging from 200 to 600 mg (e.g., schwartz et al., 2005) are
administered clinically. the doses we used to detect dat
occupancy were 2 to 8 times lower than oral doses used to
promote wakefulness in monkeys (hermant et al., 1991). at
a 200-mg dose, initial plasma modafinil levels range from 15
to 19 ␮m (wong et al., 1999), a concentration 3 times higher
than the 6 ␮m modafinil concentration needed to inhibit 50%
of dat sites in vitro. other dat modulators (e.g., amphetamine or methylphenidate) have much higher dat affinity,
and accordingly, are given at far lower doses (approximately
5–20 mg).
our finding of modafinil occupancy of striatal dat sites
provides evidence that dat modulation by modafinil may
contribute to modafinil pharmacology. this hypothesis is

and sert. cells were incubated for 18 h. a, modafinil effects

modafinil, which produced a statistically significant increase
in rlu in dat- xxxg2239xxx  cells (p ⬍ 0.02), no other significant
changes were detected.

modafinil occupies the  xxxg2149xxx  in brain

supported by the capacity of 5 mg/kg modafinil to rapidly
double striatal efflux of dopamine in dog brain and the failure
of modafinil to promote wakefulness in dat null mutant
mice (wisor et al., 2001). intriguingly, the latter study demonstrated that both modafinil and amphetamine produced
similar levels of dopamine release at equipotent wake-promoting doses. dat occupancy was similar with two different
dat probes and comparable with occupancy levels by methylphenidate, an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medication (spencer et al., 2006). at this level of occupancy,
extracellular dopamine is augmented in brain by modafinil.
modafinil also occupied net sites in the thalamus. we
monitored this brain region because the thalamus yielded the
highest net signal-to-noise ratio combined with high density of net in a previous screening of net binding sites in
various regions of primate brain (b. k. madras, unpublished
data). given at equal doses (5 mg/kg), modafinil occupancy of
the net was approximately 50% lower than dat. nevertheless, occupancy was higher than anticipated, because modafinil is 7 times less potent at blocking net than dat function

in vitro. other factors, in addition to in vitro affinity, conceivably dictate the extent of dat or net occupancy, including ligand dissociation rates, relative affinities of the two
pet probes, and relative dat or net densities in these
brain regions. furthermore, levels of endogenous substrates
(neurotransmitters and modulators) in various brain regions
are likely to affect modafinil interaction with dat and net.
modafinil is a relatively weak inhibitor of catecholamine
transporters, and its capacity to block transporter function
will be sensitive to local concentrations of competing endogenous neurotransmitters, to a greater extent than other dat
or net inhibitors, with affinities 10 to 100 times higher (e.g.,
cocaine or methylphenidate). although we did not monitor
sert occupancy, given the exceedingly low affinity of
modafinil for the sert, it is unlikely that therapeutic doses
of the drug will interact with sert to affect sert function
directly, but indirect effects cannot be ruled out.
based on the in vivo and in vitro data, it is reasonable to
surmise that modafinil could elevate dopamine and possibly
norepinephrine, and perhaps also trace amine levels in select
brain regions, and thereby indirectly activate dopamine, norepinephrine, and/or trace amine receptor subtypes. elevation
of dopamine levels has not conventionally been implicated in
sleep-wake regulation, but the present study and that of
wisor et al. (2001) implicate the dat as a potential mediator
of modafinil-induced wakefulness. potent dat inhibitors,
such as difluoropine or indatraline, promoted sleep fragmentation and increased nighttime wakefulness (madras et al.,
2006). the role of norepinephrine is less certain, because
chemical ablation of noradrenergic neurons did not block
modafinil-induced wakefulness (wisor and eriksson, 2005).
it has been postulated that modafinil increases wakefulness
by promoting glutamate release and inhibiting gaba release
(duteil et al., 1990; ferraro et al., 1997a,b, 1999; wisor et al.,
2001). in parallel with modafinil, the dat inhibitor cocaine
also promotes glutamate release and attenuates gaba release in select brain regions (cameron and williams, 1994;
reid et al., 1997).
we found that the  xxxg2099xxx  inhibitors
methylphenidate, desipramine, and citalopram  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m almost entirely block dat-, net- or sert-dependent enhancement of  xxxg2239xxx  activation by pea. the enhanced response
of  xxxg2239xxx  to monoamines observed with the cre-luc assay may
be due to the ability of monoamine transporters to deliver
agonists intracellularly, where  xxxg2239xxx  receptors are observed to
be sequestered in vitro (bunzow et al., 2001; miller et al.,
2005). however, it may also be that during the long period of
agonist treatment (18 h) required to maximize the signal-tonoise ratio in the cre-luc assay,  xxxg2239xxx  receptors may traffic to
the membrane, and that this trafficking is somehow facilitated by transporter function, although this has yet to be
investigated. we also tested modafinil at the same dose (10
␮m), which we show does not directly activate  xxxg2239xxx . but
unlike the other inhibitors, which have 15 to 100 times
higher potency, 10 ␮m modafinil is near its ic50 value for the
dat. at this dose, modafinil augmented the enhancement of
 xxxg2239xxx  activity by pea in dat- and net-expressing cells, but
not sert-expressing cells. this finding gives an initial indication that modafinil could affect, albeit indirectly, pea activation of the  xxxg2239xxx  receptor in dopamine and norepinephrine
neurons.  xxxg2239xxx  receptor mrna is present in the major monoaminergic cell groups (borowsky et al., 2001), and we have

madras et al.

used double-label dat and  xxxg2239xxx  immunocytochemistry to
demonstrate that a subset of dopamine neurons express  xxxg2239xxx 
receptors in both rhesus monkey and mouse substantia nigra
(xie et al., 2005). regardless, the augmentation of enhancement of pea activation of  xxxg2239xxx  receptors by modafinil in
dat- and net-expressing cells, but not sert cells, further
supports the hypothesis that modafinil interacts with the
dat and net.
the interaction of modafinil with the dat may account for
some of its preliminary positive clinical results in cocaine
addicts (vocci and ling, 2005). although the underlying
mechanisms are unknown for this indication, the low dat
affinity of modafinil may be advantageous as a cocaine medication. in this regard, it is likely that extracellular dopamine
inundation that ensues from potent dat inhibitor may lead
to undesirable receptor adaptations, arising from the inability of pre- or postsynaptic receptors to recycle appropriately,
particularly if dopamine levels achieve a concentration that
is likely to bind to dopamine receptors in the low-affinity
state.
in summary, the present data raise the possibility that
modafinil affects wakefulness by interacting with catechol-

amine transporters in brain. although modafinil is likely to
mediate effects via several mechanisms, the present study
supports the view that the dat and net warrant further
scrutiny as an important molecular target for this intriguing
drug.
