a series of 4,5-diaryloxazole analogs were designed and the interaction between  xxxd2807xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx  studied by the docking method to improve the biological activity and reduce the gastrointestinal side
effects of  xxxd2807xxx . finally, 3-(4-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(4-aminosulfonyl-3-fluorophenyl)-oxazole-2-yl) propanoic
acid (nc-2142), the best candidate, was selected for synthesis and bioassay based on the screening result. nc2142 could lower the tumefaction rates of back metatarsus in rats, as well as reduce the writhing times in mice.
nc-2142 produced fewer gastric lesions than  xxxd2807xxx . after the aminosulfonyl group was introduced into the
benzene ring of  xxxd2807xxx , its analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities remained unchanged, and it reduced the
number of gastric lesions. this provided a feasible method for further structure modification and optimization of
 xxxd2807xxx .

nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are the
most widely used agents for the treatment of pain, inflammation, and fever. long-term or high-dose therapy with
nsaids is associated with increased risk of damage to the
gastrointestinal (gi) tract1,2) and renal side effects.3—5) this is
because of the blocking of prostaglandin (pg) production in
inflammatory cells, and interference of the homeostasis of
pg production in the gi tract. finding novel agents that can
maintain the representation of physiological pgs and reduce
the production of pathological pgs is a challenge.
 xxxd2807xxx  (fig.1) possesses a longer-term effect and lower
gi toxicity than other nsaids,6,7) but its poor selectivity,
high dose, and long half-life greatly limit its clinical use.8,9)
puig et al. have studied a series of 3,4-diaryloxazole derivatives, the results show that when the benzene ring has the
substituent of 4-methylsulfonyl or 4-aminosulfonyl, the derivatives possess anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities,
at the same time, the fluoro substitutes on the benzene ring,
the potency has increased 3 times compared with the nonsubstituted derivatives.10) in the study of  xxxg1884xxx 
(cox-2) inhibitors, a series of isoxazole derivatives have
also been developed. the structure–activity relationship research shows that when introducing aminosulfonyl group
into benzene ring which is directly connected with isoxazole,
its aminosulfonyl group can be deep into the cox-2 hydrophobic side pocket, thus enhancing the selectivity of
cox-2 inhibition activity, showing good analgesic and antiinflammatory activities.11—13) accordingly, we try to introduce methylsulfonyl or aminosulfonyl as well as fluoro substitution into  xxxd2807xxx . a novel class of 4,5-diaryloxazole
derivatives were designed to elevate the biological activity

and reduce the gi toxicity of  xxxd2807xxx  (fig. 2). this design
was according to the structure–activity relationship of the diarylheterocycle class of cox-2 inhibitors14) and the mechanism of nsaids.15) docking was introduced to evaluate the
antagonistic potency of these analogs towards cox-2 in silico, and the best hit was selected for synthesis and bioassay.

stable the complex formed will be, and the drug is
located in the active site of the enzyme with a stable and

2 complexes are more stable than that with  xxxg1883xxx  complexes. namely, in the presence of  xxxd2807xxx  analogues,
cox-2 changes its conformation, making the analogues adsorbed on the cox-2 firmly. the binding energy when only
one fluorine atom is introduced into the benzene ring of
 xxxd2807xxx  analogues is higher than that introduced fluoro and
aminosulfonyl group at the same time, that is, the introduction of aminosulfonyl group is beneficial to the binding between ligands and enzyme, making the ligands exist stably in
the active site of the enzyme with a stable low-energy state.
the binding energy between nc-2142 and cox-2 is lowest
of all, and nearly 2 fold lower than that with  xxxg1883xxx  ( xxxg1883xxx :
de42.34 kacl · mol1, cox-2: de79.07 kacl · mol1).
the affinity energy between drug and enzyme is mainly nonbond energy, comprising van der waals energy, electrostatic
energy and hydrogen bonding energy, of which the hydrogen
bonding energy is the most important. figures 3 and 4
showed the docking results of nc-2142 with cox-2 and
 xxxg1883xxx  respectively. figure 3 showed that nc-2142 could be
accurately docked into the active site of cox-2, and that the
so2nh2 group of nc-2142 had multiple interactions with
leu352, arg513, phe518, and val523 by selective insertion
into the side pocket of the cox-2 active site. there are 5
couples of hydrogen bonding between the oxygen, nitrogen
and sulfur atoms of nc-2142 and amino acid residues existing in active site, such as phe-a518, arg-a120, arg-a513.
figure 4 showed 4 couples of hydrogen bonding between
nc-2142 and amino acid residues (his-a388, asn-a382)
of the  xxxg1883xxx  active site. the system formed by nc-2142
and cox-2, electrostatic energy 48.87 kacl · mol1, has the
lowest energy of all  xxxd2807xxx  analogues and enzyme systems. the smaller the electrostatic energy is, the stronger the
electrostatic interaction is, the more stable the complex
formed is. according to the results above, after introducing a
fluoro and an aminosulfonyl group into benzene ring of

 xxxd2807xxx  analogues, the complex formed with cox-2 was
more stable than that with  xxxg1883xxx . these results also indicated that the  xxxd2807xxx  analogs possessing a sulfonyl substituent in one of the phenyl rings can selectively inhibit the
activity of cox-2, of which nc-2142 is the most notable.
nc-2142, the best candidate, was selected for synthesis and
bioassay based on the screening result.
we have designed the synthetic route of nc-2142 and investigate its synthesis technology, and determine the optimization of synthetic route. after the bromination product of
a -(3-fluorophenyl)-4-fluoroacetophenone hydrolyzed, there
was no need to separate and purify the hydrolysis, directly
added ammonium acetate and glacial acetic acid, the yield
was 76%. then after sulfonychlorination, together with ammonia solution reaction, obtained target compound nc-2142,
nc-2142 was confirmed by ir, nmr, ms and elemental
analysis.
table 2 shows the analgesic effect of nc-2142 on the
acetic acid-induced writhing response test in mice. after
1.0% acetic acid was injected, nc-2142 showed an inhibitory
value of up to 54.0% at 100 mg/kg over 15 min. the writhing
times of all experimental groups were significantly different
from those of the control group (p0.01 or p0.001). the
anti-inflammatory activity of nc-2142 was evaluated by carrageenan-induced paw edema test in rats. carrageenan-induced edema is commonly used as an experimental model of
acute inflammation in animals and is believed to be biphasic;
the early or first phase is mediated by the release of histamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht), followed by kinin release, followed by pg release in the later or second phase.21)
it is also known that cox and lipoxygenase also have a crucial role in the formation of carrageenan-induced edema.22)
the effects of nc-2142 and the reference drug  xxxd2807xxx  on
carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats are shown in table 3.
nc-2142 showed anti-inflammatory activity up to 31.7%
at 80 mg · kg1 after 3 h of drug treatment in carrageenaninduced paw edema.
the mechanism of inflammation is correspondingly complicated, it’s generally considered that exterior stimulus results in initial injuries, thereby release many mediators of inflammation which induce inflammation. pge2 is one of the
important mediators of inflammation, the generation of pge2
is closely correlated with cox, and cox-2 can induce generous pathological pge2 which promotes inflammatory reaction and tissue damage.23,24) we have studied the effects of
nc-2142 on pge2 level of inflammatory parts and serum in
rats, the results show that nc-2142 can inhibit the product of
pge2 of inflammatory tissue and serum (table 4). therefore,
we may conclude that nc-2142 can alleviate inflammatory
reaction by inhibiting the synthesis of pge2.
analgesic and anti-inflammatory bioactivity remained effective when the aminosulfonyl group was introduced into
the benzene ring of  xxxd2807xxx . gastric lesions (table 5) induced by nc-2142 and  xxxd2807xxx  indicate that  xxxd2807xxx  had
a significant effect on the gastric mucosa in a dose-related
manner. the results were consistent with those of sheiver
et al.25) nc-2142 produced fewer gastric lesions than
 xxxd2807xxx , with statistical significance at 800 mg/kg. gastric
lesions may correlate with the binding energy with the  xxxg1884xxx  receptor.
in summary, the compounds formed after introduction of

1990

the aminosulfonyl group into the benzene ring of  xxxd2807xxx 
not only retained the analgesic activity and anti-inflammatory activity of  xxxd2807xxx , but also significantly reduced the
number of gastric lesions. the present study is promising for
further structure modification and optimization of  xxxd2807xxx ,
as well as for developing novel anti-inflammation therapies.
