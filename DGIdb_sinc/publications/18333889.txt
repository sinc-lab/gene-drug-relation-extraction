objective: severe insulin resistance and impaired pancreatic b-cell function are pathophysiological contributors to
type 2 diabetes, and ideally, antihyperglycaemic strategies should address both.
research design and methods: therapeutic benefits of combining the long-acting  xxxd2208xxx -like peptide-1
(glp-1) analog,  xxxd2495xxx  (0.4 mg/kg/day), with insulin sensitizer, pioglitazone (10 mg/kg/day), were assessed in
severely diabetic zucker diabetic fatty rats for 42 days. impact on glycaemic control was assessed by glycated haemoglobin (hba1c) at day 28 and by oral glucose tolerance test at day 42.
results:  xxxd2495xxx  and pioglitazone synergistically improved glycaemic control as reflected by a marked decrease in
hba1c ( xxxd2495xxx  þ pioglitazone: 4.8  0.3%;  xxxd2495xxx : 8.8  0.6%; pioglitazone: 7.9  0.4%; vehicle: 9.7  0.3%)
and improved oral glucose tolerance at day 42 (area under the curve;  xxxd2495xxx  þ pioglitazone: 4244  445 mmol/l
 min;  xxxd2495xxx : 7164  187 mmol/l  min; pioglitazone: 7430  446 mmol/l  min; vehicle: 8093  139 mmol/l
 min). a 24-h plasma glucose profile at day 38 was significantly decreased only in the  xxxd2495xxx  þ pioglitazone
group. in addition, 24-h insulin profile was significantly elevated only in the  xxxd2495xxx  þ pioglitazone group.
 xxxd2495xxx  significantly decreased food intake alone and in combination with pioglitazone, while pioglitazone
alone increased cumulated food intake. as a result, rats on  xxxd2495xxx  alone gained significantly less weight than
vehicle-treated rats, whereas rats on pioglitazone alone gained significantly more body weight than vehicle-treated
rats. however, combination therapy with  xxxd2495xxx  and pioglitazone caused the largest weight gain, probably
reflecting marked improvement of energy balance because of reduction of glucosuria.
conclusions: combination therapy with insulinotropic glp-1 agonist  xxxd2495xxx  and insulin sensitizer, pioglitazone,
improves glycaemic control above and beyond what would be expected from additive effects of the two antidiabetic
agents.

synergistic antihyperglycaemic effects of  xxxg1807xxx  and glp-1 analog therapy

introduction
throughout the world, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes
is on the rise. formerly, initial treatment of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes was diet and exercise [1], but as
about 95% of successfully weight-reduced people are
back to their initial weight few years after initiation of
the weight reducing therapy, such therapy is largely
futile [2]. hence, many consider pharmacotherapy the
only feasible strategy for treatment of type 2 diabetes.
the goal is to both reduce hyperglycaemia and improve
peripheral insulin sensitivity. traditionally, this has
been accomplished using either an insulin-sensitizing
agent such as metformin or an insulinotropic sulfonylurea compound in monotherapy. sulfonylurea compounds act at the level of pancreatic b-cells by eliciting
insulin release even at normoglycaemia, rendering
clinical use associated with frequent episodes of
hypoglycaemia [3,4]. in addition, persistent use of sulfonylurea compounds causes b-cell desensitization,
resulting in loss of clinical efficacy [5]. the secondary
b-cell desensitization accompanying persistent use of
sulfonylurea compounds has spurred an extensive
search for alternative insulinotropic agents with longer
lasting effects. pharmacotherapy based on glucagonlike peptide-1 (glp-1) comprises such an alternative,
providing efficacious glucose lowering and simultaneous weight loss. plasma levels of endogenous glp-1
can be elevated by drugs inhibiting the action of  xxxg651xxx  ( xxxg651xxx ), resulting in improved
glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes [6].
however, more efficacious glycaemic control is obtained with use of glp-1 analogs [7,8]. chronic use of
glp-1 analogs decrease body weight, and experimental
evidence exists to support a preserving if not a regenerating proliferative role of glp-1 on pancreatic b-cells
in rodents [9].
agents acting by activation of nuclear peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-g ( xxxg1807xxx ) comprise a relatively novel pharmacological route to improve
peripheral insulin sensitivity [10]. recent clinical experience gathered for combination therapy with  xxxg651xxx 
inhibitors and thiazolidinediones clearly shows that
such regimes are more efficacious compared with the
use of maximally recommended doses of drugs from
either class [11]. as the glp-1 analogs are more efficacious than  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors, it seems evident that combination of these agents with insulin-sensitizing  xxxg1807xxx 
agonists could be a particular efficacious therapeutic
option for patients with type 2 diabetes.
using severely insulin-resistant diabetic rats, we have
evaluated antihyperglycaemic efficacy of combination

therapy with the novel glp-1 analog,  xxxd2495xxx , and

materials and methods
animals and dosing
seventy male zucker diabetic fatty (zdf) rats were
obtained from charles river, belgium. animals arrived
at rheoscience animal research facilities when 11 weeks
of age. on arrival to the animal unit, rats were caged pair
wise and allowed to acclimatize for 7 days. rats were
housed under a normal light cycle (light from 06:00 to
18:00 hours) at controlled temperature conditions with
ad libitum access to chow (purina 5008) and water.
all animal experiments were conducted in accordance
with rheoscience bioethical guidelines, which are fully
compliant to internationally accepted principles for the
care and use of laboratory animals. the described experimets are covered by personal licenses to p. j. l. (2004/
561-859) issued by the danish committee for animal
research.
one day before initiation of dosing, rats were stratified
into five groups (n ¼ 9–10) according to area under the
curve (auc) for glucose obtained at an oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt) on day 4 (vide infra). one group of animals (n ¼ 9) was sacrificed to serve as baseline at day 0.
from this group, whole blood for glycated haemoglobin
(hba1c) and plasma was obtained from cardiac puncture before the pancreas was removed and fixed as
described subsequently. remaining rats received one of
four treatments: vehicle 1 b.i.d. þ vehicle 2 b.i.d. (n ¼
10); pioglitazone 5 mg/kg b.i.d. þ vehicle 2 b.i.d. (n ¼ 10);
vehicle 1 b.i.d. þ  xxxd2495xxx  200 mg/kg b.i.d. (n ¼ 10);
and pioglitazone 5 mg/kg b.i.d. þ  xxxd2495xxx  200 mg/kg
b.i.d. (n ¼ 10). pioglitazone suspended in 10% hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin (w/v) was administered in
a volume of 0.5 ml by oral gavage b.i.d, whereas  xxxd2495xxx  dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline was administered subcutaneously b.i.d. drugs were administered
between 7:00 and 8:00 hours and between 15:00 and
16:00 hours for 42 days.

basal metabolic parameters
measurements of 24-h food and water intake were carried out weekly on days 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 41.
twenty-four hours’ food intake and body weight was
measured weekly (from 7:00 to 8:00 hours). after finishing 24-h observation period, a tail blood sample was
taken for analysis of plasma glucose and insulin levels
(see subsequently). on day 28, a sample for hba1c

measurement was also taken after termination of the
24-h observation period.

oral glucose tolerance test
this test was carried out at 8:00 hours 4 days before the
first dose was administered (stratification) and on the day
before terminating the experiment (day 42). animals were
mildly fasted as they had had access to only 50% of their
daily energy requirements in the preceding 20 h (since
12:00 hours the previous day). blood samples were taken
from a tail vein and plasma glucose was measured at time
points 30, 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min after oral
administration of 2 g/kg glucose (glucose 500 mg/ml;
fresenius kabi, sweden). plasma insulin was measured
at time points 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min using an
ultrasensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (diamyd, stockholm, sweden). a baseline blood sample of
500 ml was taken at time t ¼ –30 min from the tail vein.
a sample of this size allowed for analysis of both glycaemic and lipid variables (vide infra).

twenty-four hours’ glycaemic profile
on day 38, blood samples for analysis of p-glucose and
p-insulin were taken every 4 h  xxxd2274xxx :00, 11:00, 15:00, 19:00,
23:00 and 03:00 hours. glucose and insulin levels were
measured as described previously.

blood sampling and plasma measurements
terminal blood samples (minimum 600 ml plasma) were
collected in heparinized-/licl-containing tubes and
centrifuged at 2800 g for 10 min at 4 °c. plasma levels of
glucose, total cholesterol and triacylglycerol (tg) were
measured using standard enzyme assay kits on a fully automated analyser (vitros dtii, ortho diagnostics, rochester,
ny, usa). plasma non-esterified free  xxxd2154xxx  (nefa)
were determined by a spectrophotometer using acylcoa oxidase-based colorimetric kit (nefa-c; wako
pure chemicals, osaka, japan). samples taken in serum
vacutainer þ 1% naf were used for free  xxxd2154xxx  (ffa)
analyses. hba1c was measured using a filter photometer
(dca2000; bayer health care, lyngby, denmark).

body composition and termination
at termination of the experiments, animals were sacrificed and trunk blood sampled for drug exposure analysis
as well as for measurements of aforementioned biochemical variables. white adipose tissue compartments were

removed from exsanguinated rats and weighed. fat depot
analysis included retroperitoneal, epididymal and subcutaneous inguinal fat. the pancreas was removed by
dissection of the entire mesenterial adipose tissue block,
which was transferred to 4% paraformaldehyde and fixed
overnight.
the pancreata were isolated, weighed, fractionated by
the smooth fractionator method with f ¼ ¼ in each of
two capsules, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin in a
tp1050 tissue preparation machine leica, herlev, denmark [12]. randomly, microtome sections of 3 mm thickness were used throughout.

histology
sections were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated and
antigen retrieval treatment carried out in 0.01 m citrate
buffer ph 6.0 (preheated to 98 °c). sections were then
cooled, rinsed and endogenous peroxidase blocked by
20 min of incubation with 0.5% h2o2. finally, the sections were washed in water, followed by tris-buffered
saline þ 0.01% triton x-100. the remaining immunohistochemical staining reactions for insulin and the sum
of glucagon þ somatostatin þ  xxxg1823xxx 
were carried out in an autostainer (dako denmark a/s,
glostrup, denmark). the b- and non–b-cell mass was
estimated using stereological point counting on sections
immunohistochemically stained for insulin and the
non–b-cell hormones, counting two sections, 250 mm
apart. the estimated cell volumes were expressed as
a percentage of the total pancreatic volume and also
converted to milligram cells total by multiplication by
the pancreas weight, or as milligram cells per kilogram
body weight [12].

stereology
sections stained for insulin and the combination of glucagon, somatostatin and  xxxg1823xxx  were
used for the estimation of the b-cell volume fraction
(vvol-b) and non–b-cell volume fractions (vvol-non-b).
the analysis used an olympus bx-50 microscope
with video camera and monitor, a pc-controlled motorized stage and the cast-grid 2.0 software (olympus,
copenhagen, denmark).
initially, the tissue sections were circumscribed using
a 1.25 objective, and within these areas, the counting
of b-cell and exocrine structures was carried out. the
volume fractions of b-cells (vvol-b) or non-b-cells (vvolnon-b) were estimated by point counting stereological
techniques at a total on-screen magnification of 1026
(20 objective), a grid of 4  48 points, and random

systematic scanning of the tissue sections with step
lengths of 550  410 mm controlled by the cast-grid 2.0
software. two sections were examined from each rat
pancreas. the sections were examined, with the origin
of the sections blinded to the observer.

data management and statistical evaluation
data were presented graphically using graph pad prism
software, while statistical analysis was performed using
statview software (graphpad software, san diego, ca,
usa). data were analysed using one-way analysis of
variance (anova). results are presented as mean 
s.e.m. unless otherwise stated. statistical evaluation of
the data was carried out using one-way anova when
required and two-way anova when potential interaction of two drugs was assessed. the anova was followed with fisher’s post hoc analysis between control
and treatment groups in cases where statistical significance was established (p < 0.05).
from stereology, the number of hits recorded for points
falling over b-cells, non-b-cells, total pancreas tissue and
other tissue (lymph nodes, fat, etc.) was transformed into
volume fractions, which were subsequently recalculated
into total cell mass in milligrams, and finally into relative
cell mass in milligrams per kilogram. area-weighted
mean values were calculated from the two sections. data
accumulation and basic statistics were carried out in ms
excel. data were presented as mean  s.e.

energy homeostasis
to assess therapeutic impact on energy homeostasis in
adult male zdf rats, food and water intake was measured
frequently as was also body weight. as diabetes progresses in male zdf rats, glucosuria becomes evident
and resulting compensatory increase in water intake is
noticed. animals showing marked glucosuria loose large
quantities of ingested energy through this route, and
hence, their body weight gain progressively dampens as
the condition deteriorates [13].
when assessing the drug effect on food intake, no interaction between  xxxd2495xxx  and pioglitazone was observed
(two-way anova: f1,36 ¼ 1.49, p ¼ 0.2). thus, compared
with vehicle-treated rats,  xxxd2495xxx  treatment with or
without concomitant administration of pioglitazone significantly reduced daily as well as cumulated food
intake in zdf rats (figure 1). in contrast, pioglitazonetreated animals had a significant higher cumulated as
well as 24-h food intake at days 14 and 41 when com-

body weight gain was significantly lower in animals
subjected to  xxxd2495xxx –vehicle treatment (p < 0.0001)
(figure 1). on day 41, these differences in body weight
gain had not changed. after 41 days of treatment, the

of  xxxd2495xxx  and pioglitazone had gained significantly
more weight than the group treated with only pioglitazone

fat depots
on the final day (day 42), animals were sacrificed and
subcutaneous inguinal fat, epididymal fat and perirenal
fat isolated and weighed. when compared with vehicletreated rats, all three fat depots were larger in animals
treated with pioglitazone (p < 0.01 for inguinal fat depot
and 0.0001 for epididymal and perirenal fat) or in combination with  xxxd2495xxx  (p < 0.0001 for all three fat depots;
table 1). two-way anova test confirmed that the two
drugs displayed interaction at all depots (epididymal –
f1,36 ¼ 9.3, p ¼ 0.004; inguinal – f1,36 ¼ 5.6, p ¼ 0.03;
perirenal – f1,36 ¼ 4.5, p ¼ 0.04), with the two drugs in
combination yielding the most prominent weight
increase. in  xxxd2495xxx  only–treated rats, the fat depots
were slightly smaller than in vehicle-treated rats, but
only the decrease in epididymal fat mass reached statistical significance (p < 0.05 vs. vehicle).

temporal course of plasma glucose and insulin
after 14 days, the combined pioglitazone– xxxd2495xxx 
treatment reduced plasma glucose significantly more
than either of the two drugs alone (interaction two-way
anova: f1,36 ¼ 37.2, p < 0.0001). a small but significant
reduction of plasma glucose was seen in the liraglutidetreated group (p < 0.05) at day 14, whereas the pioglitazone alone had no impact on plasma glucose levels
when compared with vehicle-treated animals (figure 2).
the impressive effect of the pioglitazone– xxxd2495xxx 
combination therapy on morning plasma glucose levels
persisted throughout the treatment period, whereas monotherapies neither with  xxxd2495xxx  nor with pioglitazone
were efficacious in lowering plasma glucose levels at
day 35. likewise, combination therapy with  xxxd2495xxx 
and pioglitazone was the only treatment paradigm that

at day 37, circadian profiles of plasma glucose and insulin were assessed by repeated sampling every 4 h. the
resulting profiles are graphically presented in figure 3.
combination therapy with  xxxd2495xxx  and pioglitazone
significantly reduced 24-h plasma glucose levels (twoway anova: f1,36 ¼ 12.6, p ¼ 0.001), and also, monotherapy with  xxxd2495xxx  significantly improved circadian
plasma glucose (p < 0.05 vs. vehicle). pioglitazone treatment was not able to reduce 24-h plasma glucose profile
at day 35. plasma insulin levels were unaffected by any
of the monotherapy regimes, whereas combination of
 xxxd2495xxx  with pioglitazone significantly elevated the
auc obtained from the insulin profile (p < 0.01 vs.
vehicle–vehicle, but without interaction; two-way
anova: f1,36 ¼ 3.2, p ¼ 0.08).
oral glucose tolerance test
on the day of termination of the experiment (day 42),
rats were subjected to an ogtt in the semistarved state
(figure 4). combination therapy with  xxxd2495xxx  and pioglitazone significantly and synergistically lowered plasma
glucose excursion during the ogtt (p < 0.001 vs. vehicle–
vehicle; two-way anova: f1,36 ¼ 11.2, p ¼ 0.0019),
whereas  xxxd2495xxx  alone marginally improved oral glucose tolerance (p < 0.05 vs. vehicle). after 42 days of
treatment, pioglitazone alone had no impact on oral glucose tolerance. insulin release during the ogtt was also
measured. only combination therapy with  xxxd2495xxx 
and pioglitazone significantly increased insulin secretion
in otherwise relatively hypoinsulinaemic zdf rats (auc:
71.7  2.9 vs. 44.5  2.7 nmol/l  min, p < 0.001 vs.
vehicle; figure 5). this effect was additive as no interaction could be detected (two-way anova: f1,36 ¼ 2.01,
p ¼ 0.15). however, sustainability of  xxxd2495xxx -induced

discussion
to further scrutinize the glucose-lowering therapeutic
potential combining a  xxxg899xxx  agonist with a thia-

zolidinedione, we have used the once-daily human glp-1
analog,  xxxd2495xxx , as an insulinotropic agent and the
clinically well-proven  xxxg1807xxx  agonist, pioglitazone, as
insulin sensitizer [14,15]. as an animal model for
human type 2 diabetes, we have used severely insulinresistant zdf rats, which by many investigators are considered an adequate proxy for treatment-resistant
human type 2 diabetes [13]. the onset of diabetes in
zdf occurs at 6–7 weeks of age, and when antidiabetic
treatment with either glp-1 analog or  xxxg1807xxx  agonists is
initiated at this point in life, progression rate of diabetes

synergistic antihyperglycaemic effects of  xxxg1807xxx  and glp-1 analog therapy

becomes markedly dampened by such early intervention [16–21]. however, earlier experience with the use
of older, overtly diabetic zdf rats in various therapeutic
regimes is in line with our current observations, showing that neither of the monotherapy regimes efficaciously improved glycaemic control after 42 days of
treatment [18,19,22]. in the present study, all groups
had clearly elevated blood glucose (bg) and insulin levels as well as similar b-cell mass. in spite of this, significant lower bg and higher plasma insulin levels were
found in the group treated with the combination of  xxxd2495xxx  and pioglitazone compared with groups treated
with monotherapy or vehicle. compared with vehicle
and pioglitazone, basal insulin levels were initially
slightly elevated in  xxxd2495xxx -treated zdf rats, but this
effect waned after 2 weeks of treatment, whereafter,
only rats in combination therapy displayed elevated
insulin levels, suggesting that concomitant improvement of insulin action conserve insulinotropic activity
of  xxxd2495xxx . the underlying mechanism of this particularly advantageous combination is at present unknown,
but both  xxxd2495xxx  and pioglitazone have several other
beneficial effects in addition to their respective main
insulinotropic and insulin-sensitizing effects.
the glp-1 analog, exenatide, has a half-life of 3.3–4 h
after subcutaneous injection in humans, with yielding
pharmacodynamic effects lasting for about 12–16 h, when
the drug is administered b.i.d. with a twice-daily dosing
regime, exenatide is pharmacologically active for approximately 12–16 h. the most striking difference between
exenatide and  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors is the absence on body
weight of the latter most likely explained by their modest
impact on plasma glp-1.  xxxd2495xxx  is an analog of  xxxg873xxx , sharing 97% homology with natural glp-1.  xxxd2495xxx 
has a subcutaneous half-life of 11–15 h [23], resulting in
a lasting 24-h pharmacodynamic profile on once-daily
administration [24]. when applying optimally tolerated
doses of  xxxd2495xxx  (1.9 mg/day), 14 weeks of therapy
lowers hba1c by 1.74% (12). similarly, the long-acting
formulation of exenatide is significantly more efficacious than the twice-daily injection regime of exenatide,
as hba1c is lowered by 1.7% [25].
therapeutic strategies addressing both insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion are appealing as a large proportion of subjects with type 2 diabetes are in need of
more efficacious therapies if hba1c is to be reduced to
a target of less than 7%. additional glycaemic control is
obtained more efficaciously when combing a longacting glp-1 analog with a tzd than seen for the combination of a tzd and a  xxxg651xxx  inhibitor [11,26,27]. the
maximal antihyperglycaemic efficacy of  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors rely on their capability to fully exploit endogenous

glp-1, whereas exogenous glp-1 analogs can be
applied in pharmacological doses and are limited
largely by their potential side effects. compared with
normoglycaemic control subjects, meal-induced release
of endogenous glp-1 is diminished in people with type
2 diabetes [28]. people with type 2 diabetes have less
than optimal meal-induced glp-1 secretion to protect
against degradation by  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors, rendering
therapy with glp-1 analogs, which essentially shortcut
the l-cells more likely to exert better efficacy than what
can be obtained by full exploitation of body’s own  xxxg873xxx  source.
the hyperphagia of zdf rats is a result of dysfunctional
leptin signalling as well as caloric wasting because of
marked glucosuria [13]. clearly,  xxxd2495xxx  in monotherapy dampened the hyperphagia resulting from
impaired  xxxg1320xxx  signalling, but it was also
capable of reducing the increased feeding response in
pioglitazone-treated animals. it is well known that pioglitazone transiently increases food consumption in rats
[21,29], and as it occurred together with a slight
improvement of glycaemic control, it is likely to cause
even larger caloric load of the currently examined zdf
rats.  xxxd2495xxx  significantly counteracted the pioglitazone-induced hyperphagia, but it is uncertain whether
this effect was simply the consequence of improving
glycaemic control and hence reducing hyperphagia
induced by caloric loss or whether  xxxd2495xxx  can actually neutralize pioglitazone-induced feeding behaviour.
a thorough study in animals not affected by caloric
wasting diuresis would be required to further scrutinize
the impact of  xxxd2495xxx  on pioglitazone-induced feeding, but it is tempting to speculate that people with type
2 diabetes would benefit from such combination therapy as a common side effect of pioglitazone therapy is
weight gain [15]. thus, part of the impressive synergistic effect on glycaemic control seen when combining  xxxd2495xxx  with pioglitazone may be because of the
anorectic function of  xxxd2495xxx . it is well known that
pharmacologically induced reduction of caloric consumption in people type 2 diabetes is accompanied by
improved glycaemic control [30,31]. thus, the glp-1
analogs appear ideally suited for combination therapy
with insulin sensitizers as this combination addresses
two independent modes of action improving glycaemic
control (insulin release and action) and on top of it
comes decreased caloric intake, which in its own right
improves glycaemic control.
experience with combination of  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors and
pioglitazone in rats is limited to short-ranging treatment
periods of insulin-resistant, obese zucker rats [32]. thus,
10 days of treatment with a combination of  xxxd3510xxx

synergistic antihyperglycaemic effects of  xxxg1807xxx  and glp-1 analog therapy

and pioglitazone significantly and synergistically improved plasma clearance of glucose during an ogtt
[32]. however, it is impossible to extrapolate what
4 weeks of treatment would have accomplished and also
the fact that the study was performed in non-diabetic
rats renders a direct comparison with our data impossible. considering the clinical evidence gathered so far, it
seems unlikely that combination of  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors
and pioglitazone will improve glycaemic control synergistically as seen for  xxxd2495xxx  and tzds. in subjects
with type 2 diabetes, 26 weeks of combination therapy
with pioglitazone (30 mg/day) and  xxxd3510xxx  (100 mg/
day) is more efficacious than either drug alone, but the
combined effect is less than additive, suggesting that
more optimal combinations should be sought [33].
histological examinations of pancreata obtained from
zdf rats treated with glp-1 analogs as well as  xxxg651xxx 
inhibitors have shown that early onset of therapy in a preventive mode can halt the progressive loss of b-cells otherwise characterizing this animal model [12]. in the
present study, an impressive improvement of glycaemic
control was not accompanied by increased b-cell mass,
although circulating plasma insulin levels was markedly elevated in animals on combination therapy. thus,
it was quite obvious that initiation of subchronic antidiabetic treatment with a glp-1 analog either alone or in
combination with pioglitazone was incapable of altering
the number of b-cells. however, a significant synergy
between  xxxd2495xxx  and pioglitazone was observed with
respect to sustainability of insulin secretion, suggesting
that b-cells of zdf rats exposed to this combination
therapy maintain a much improved secretory capacity.
although this will have to be verified rigorously by an
arginine challenge or by a similar model, there is solid
clinical evidence that  xxxg1807xxx  agonists improve b-cell
function [34]. loss of b-cells is a salient feature of zdf
rats, and it remains to be proven that pharmacotherapeutic intervention can actually restore b-cells already
lost. a number of in vitro studies have shown that  xxxg873xxx  treatment directly affects b-cell apoptosis, suggesting
lesser decay of secretory b-cell capacity after prolonged
 xxxg899xxx  activation [35]. however, in vivo studies
of b-cell protective and/or growth-promoting effects of
 xxxg899xxx  stimulation have been difficult to interpret as they invariably include improvement of glycaemic control. hence, it is difficult to ascertain whether
improved b-cell function is a direct or an indirect consequence of  xxxg899xxx  stimulation. thus, some scientific reports claim to have observed glp-1-mediated
b-cell regeneration, but as none of the studies has been
able to separate indirect impact of improved glycaemic
control from direct trophic effects, it is still speculative

whether glp-1 analogs can actually bring more b-cells
to a diseased pancreas typically seen at late stages of
type 2 diabetes [36]. circumstantial evidence gathered
from few patients suffering severe hypoglycaemic crises
subsequent to gastric bypass surgery has linked abnormal glp-1 secretion to their insulinomas, thereby suggesting a causative link between glp-1 and pancreatic
b-cell growth also in humans [37].
in conclusion, we have shown that combination of otherwise subefficacious doses of a  xxxg899xxx  agonist
and an insulin sensitizer markedly improves glycaemic
control above and beyond what could be expected from
monotherapy with either agent. it seems prudent to suggest that this treatment modality offers interesting alternative to insulin, which is otherwise considered last
resort in severely insulin-resistant subjects with type 2
diabetes.
