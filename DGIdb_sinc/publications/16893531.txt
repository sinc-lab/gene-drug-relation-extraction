the effects of  xxxg2148xxx  inactivation
on locomotor activity in mice

background: acute administration of different classes of antidepressants can enhance or reduce spontaneous locomotor activity in
a novel environment, but the effects of chronic antidepressant treatment on spontaneous locomotor activity in novel and familiar
environments are less well characterized. because norepinephrine is an important regulator of spontaneous locomotor activity, we
speculated that  xxxg2148xxx  blockade contributes to the effects of some antidepressants on spontaneous locomotor
activity.
methods: antidepressant drugs ( xxxd3089xxx , desipramine, imipramine, venlafaxine, bupropion) were administered acutely (intraperitoneal) or chronically (via osmotic minipump) to control and  xxxg2148xxx  knockout mice, and spontaneous
locomotor activity in novel or familiar environments was recorded.
results: acute treatment with most  xxxg2148xxx – blocking antidepressants decreased spontaneous locomotor activity in
a novel environment, whereas chronic treatment decreased spontaneous locomotor activity in both novel and familiar environments.
the exception was bupropion, a dual  xxxg2148xxx / xxxg2149xxx  blocker, which tended to increase spontaneous
locomotor activity. coadministration of  xxxd3089xxx  and the  xxxg2149xxx  blocker gbr 12909 also increased spontaneous
locomotor activity.  xxxg2148xxx  knockout mice had low basal spontaneous locomotor activity, which was increased by
bupropion, whereas  xxxd3089xxx  had no effect in  xxxg2148xxx  knockout mice.
conclusions: acute or chronic inactivation of the  xxxg2148xxx  decreases spontaneous locomotor activity in novel and
familiar environments unless coupled with  xxxg2149xxx  blockade.

second, none has used a paradigm that approaches therapeutic
conditions (i.e., chronic therapeutic serum drug levels). third,
none has assessed long-term (e.g., 24-hour) locomotor activity
during chronic treatment.
our study focused on ne and  xxxg2148xxx 
(net) inhibitor antidepressants and was designed to address all
three limitations. using the mouse model, we systematically
tested the effects of chronic antidepressant administration on
short-term spontaneous locomotor activity (sla) in a novel
environment and long-term (24-hour) in a familiar environment.
to address drug specificity, we used the selective net inhibitor
 xxxd3089xxx , which does not interact with other transporters or
receptors (wong et al 2000), and net knockout (net ko) mice,
which have a specific deletion of the gene encoding net. to
mimic human antidepressant treatment, we administered  xxxd3089xxx  (rbx) via an osmotic minipump for 18 –20 days at a dose
that produced therapeutic serum levels of drug. finally, we
systematically tested the chronic effects of four other antidepressant net inhibitor classes on sla at therapeutically relevant
serum levels: desipramine (dmi; tricyclic net inhibitor), imipramine (imi; tricyclic net and serotonin transporter [sert] inhibitor), venlafaxine (ven; selective net and sert inhibitor) and
bupropion (bup; selective net and  xxxg2149xxx  [dat]
inhibitor).

he monoamines dopamine (da), serotonin, norepinephrine (ne), and epinephrine (epi) are important modulators of both psychomotor activity and mood (brown and
gershon 1993; fishman et al 1983; geyer 1996; ressler and
nemeroff 1999; stone et al 2003). alterations of the monoamine
systems likely contribute to depression (brocco et al 2002;
brunello et al 2002; frazer 2000; stone et al 2003), which
interestingly is often marked by abnormal, usually retarded,
psychomotor activity (caligiuri and ellwanger 2000; sachdev and
aniss 1994; sobin and sackeim 1997). in addition, some forms of
depression in humans and animal models show psychomotor
hyperactivity or agitation, which is thought to reflect increased
responsiveness to stressful stimuli (marks et al 1971; sobin and
sackeim 1997).
the standard pharmacologic treatments for depression block
one or more monoamine transporters, increasing extracellular
monoamine availability. although these drugs alleviate such
symptoms as anhedonia and despair in both humans and
animals, one of their most common, and perhaps debilitating,
side effects is sedation and decreased psychomotor activity
(brocco et al 2002; tucker and file 1986). currently there is no
generally accepted explanation for the phenomenon, and surprisingly few studies have characterized the effects of antidepressants on motor activity. furthermore, previous animal work has
three main limitations: first, many studies have used antidepres-

drugs
drugs used in this study were  xxxd3089xxx  (pfizer, groton,

imipramine (sigma-aldrich), bupropion (sigma-aldrich), gbr
12909 (sigma-aldrich), and venlafaxine (wyeth, monmouth junction, new jersey).
antidepressant administration
drugs were administered acutely via intraperitoneal (ip)
injection or chronically via alzet osmotic minipumps (model
#2004, .25 ␮l/hour, 28 days; durect, cupertino, california). for
chronic administration, antidepressants were dissolved in either
.9% nacl ( xxxd3089xxx , 20 mg/kg/day; imipramine, 120 mg/kg/
day; venlafaxine, 20 mg/kg/day; bupropion, 40 mg/kg/day) or
an aqueous solution containing 50% ethanol and .9% nacl
(desipramine, 20 mg/kg/day), and loaded into pumps. doses
were chosen to achieve serum levels that fell within or very close
to the human therapeutic range (ahern et al 2006). minipumps
containing .9% nacl or a 50% ethanol/.9% nacl aqueous solution
were used as control vehicles. all pumps were placed in a sterile
37°c saline bath for 1 day before implantation. mice were
anesthetized with isoflurane, and minipumps were implanted in

antidepressants were dissolved in vehicle (.9% nacl) except for
gbr 12909 (1.5%  xxxd1896xxx , .9% nacl) and injected ip
as a bolus (10 ml/kg) by using the same doses as for the chronic
paradigm. the exceptions were 1) imipramine, which caused
profound ataxia and sedation when 120 mg/kg was injected
acutely, so 20 mg/kg was used instead and 2) gbr 12909 (20

results
selective net blocker antidepressants and tricyclics typically
reduce sla in a novel environment when administered acutely
(e.g., tucker and file 1986; brocco et al 2002), whereas dual
selective sert/net and dat/net inhibitors increase sla. to
confirm these findings in our paradigm, we administered rbx,
dmi, imi, ven, and bup to dbh ⫹/⫺ mice via ip injection and
measured sla in a novel environment 30 min later. similar to
previous reports, we found that most selective net inhibitor and
tricyclic antidepressants that we tested decreased sla in a novel
environment, especially during the first 30 – 60 min. for rbx
(figure 2a) and dmi (figure 2b), there was a significant effect
of time [rbx: f (3,56) ⫽ 54.02, p ⬍ .0001; dmi: f (3,56) ⫽ 28.31,
p ⬍ .0001], treatment [rbx: f (1,56) ⫽ 29.6, p ⬍ .0001; dmi:
f (1,56) ⫽ 8.26, p ⬍ .01), and a time ⫻ treatment interaction
[rbx: f (3,56) ⫽ 3.47, p ⬍ .05; dmi: f (3,56) ⫽ 3.67, p ⬍ .05]. for
imi (figure 2c), there was a significant effect of time [f (3,56) ⫽
23.17, p ⬍ .0001] and a time ⫻ treatment interaction [f (3,56) ⫽
2.95, p ⬍ .05]. in contrast, ven (figure 2d) had no effect on sla
[significant effect only of time: f (3,56) ⫽ 36.17, p ⬍ .0001],
whereas bup (figure 2e) potently enhanced sla at all time
points [time: f (3,56) ⫽ 2.95, p ⬍ .05; treatment: f (1,56) ⫽ 109.4,
p ⬍ .0001]. bupropion is the only net/dat blocker antidepressant, suggesting that the increase in sla by simultaneous dat
blockade overrode the ability of net blockade to reduce sla.
indeed, when the selective dat blocker gbr 12909 was coadministered with rbx, sla was enhanced, [treatment: f (1,56) ⫽
73.27, p ⬍ .0001], confirming this hypothesis.
to determine how chronic treatment with various classes of
net inhibitor antidepressants influences exploratory activity,
we administered rbx, dmi, imi, ven, and bup to dbh ⫹/⫺
mice for 18 –20 days via an osmotic minipump and measured
sla in a novel environment (figure 3). similar to the acute
administration experiment, most antidepressants decreased sla.
for rbx (figure 3a), there was a significant effect of time
[f (3,88) ⫽ 21.16, p ⬍ .0001], treatment [f (1,88) ⫽ 54.13, p ⬍

there was a significant effect of time [dmi: f (3,84) ⫽ 23.07, p ⬍

f (1,84) ⫽ 11.39, p ⬍ .01; ven: f (1,88) ⫽ 19.99, p ⬍ .0001]. in
contrast, bup had no effect on sla (figure 3e). none of the
treatments caused obvious sedation in the mice. we also assessed the effects of chronic rbx treatment on long-term sla in
a familiar environment. chronic rbx significantly reduced sla
over 24 hours [time: f (48,686) ⫽ 5.19, p ⬍ .0001; treatment:
f (1,686) ⫽ 5.25, p ⬍ .05], and this effect was specific to the dark
phase [time: f (5,84) ⫽ 3.69, p ⬍ .01; treatment: f (1,84) ⫽ 5.75,
p ⬍ .05] (figure 4). the rbx-treated group appeared to be
slightly more active during the light phase, but the difference was
not significant.
to confirm that a reduction of sla could be mediated solely
by net blockade, we examined the sla of net ko mice. we
found that net ko mice had low sla in a novel environment, as
previously reported (figure 5a; xu et al 2000). there was a
significant effect of time [f (3,52) ⫽ 23.66, p ⬍ .0001], genotype
[f (1,52) ⫽ 31.02, p ⬍ .0001], and a genotype ⫻ time interaction
[f (3,52) ⫽ 6.59, p ⬍ .001]. moreover, both acute (figure 5a) and
chronic (figure 5b) treatment of wt mice with  xxxd3089xxx 
reduced sla in a novel environment [acute: time: f (3,52) ⫽
29.95, p ⬍ .0001; treatment: f (1,52) ⫽ 24.29, p ⬍ .0001; chronic:
time: f (3,68) ⫽ 38.61, p ⬍ .0001; treatment: f (1,68) ⫽ 32.84, p ⬍
.0001], whereas rbx had no effect in net ko mice, demonstrating that the effects of rbx on sla in wt mice were mediated
exclusively by net blockade. to determine whether the locomotor-activating effects of bup were dependent on the net,

we tested the effects of bup on sla in wt and net ko mice
(figure 6a). when administered acutely, bup increased sla in
both wt [time: f (3,52) ⫽ 15.77, p ⬍ .0001; treatment: f (1,52) ⫽
5.6, p ⫽ .0001] and net ko mice [time: f (3,56) ⫽ 22.14, p ⬍

novel environment. chronic bup treatment also increased sla
in a novel environment in both wt [time: f (3,52) ⫽ 13.72, p ⬍
.0001; treatment: f (1,52) ⫽ 22.56, p ⬍ .0001] (figure 6b) and

increased 24-hour activity in wt mice [treatment: f (1,156) ⫽

(figure 4), the drug-induced change in activity was restricted to
the dark phase. chronic bup had a tendency to slightly increase
24-hour activity in net ko mice, especially early in the dark
phase (figure 6d), but the result was not quite significant
[treatment: f (1,168) ⫽ 3.07, p ⫽ .08]. dark-phase activity was

although previous studies have shown that acute or quasichronic (multiple ip injections) administration of net inhibitors
decreases motor activity in rodents (tucker and file 1986; vogel
et al 1986), the experiments presented here constitute the first
study that has systematically evaluated the chronic effects of
various classes of net inhibitor antidepressants on sla at
therapeutically relevant serum drug concentrations. in addition,
the effect of chronic antidepressant administration on long-term
locomotor activity in a familiar environment had never been
examined. because compounds used in some studies, such as
dmi and imi, act at sites other than monoamine transporters,
such as ion channels and acetylcholine, histamine, adrenergic
receptors (frazer 1997), the effects could not be directly attributed to net blockade. furthermore, lacking a measure of
circulating serum levels of drug (vogel et al 1986), the therapeutic relevance was unclear (tucker and file 1986). brocco and
colleagues (2002) thoroughly investigated the effects of acute
antidepressant administration and found that drugs that block
either sert alone or sert and net increased sla, whereas
selective net inhibitors either decreased sla or had no effect.
our acute results are in agreement for the selective net inhibitor
rbx, but not for the dual selective net/sert inhibitor ven
(increase in sla in the brocco study, no effect in our study). the
reason for this difference is unclear. however, when given
chronically, all tricyclics, rbx, and ven decreased sla, highlighting the importance of examining both acute and chronic
drug administration. furthermore, chronic rbx administration
decreased 24-hour sla in a familiar environment, an effect that
was restricted to the dark phase. the net ko mice had low sla
in a novel environment as previously reported (xu et al 2000),
and we further demonstrated low dark-phase activity in a familiar
environment. importantly, rbx had no further effect on sla in
the absence of net. taken together, these results demonstrate
that both acute and chronic net blockade inhibits sla at times
when mice are typically most active (exposure to novel environment, dark phase of the circadian cycle).
ne and epi typically enhance sla, whereas blockade of
adrenergic signaling (particularly ␣1-adrenergic receptors) re-

h.a. mitchell et al
duces sla (harro et al 1995; stone et al 1999; weinshenker et al
2002a). how then can we reconcile the increase in extracellular
ne with the decrease in sla after net blockade? one possibility
is that net blockade increases signaling via inhibitory ␣2 autoreceptors, thus decreasing noradrenergic neuron firing and
evoked ne release. in addition, chronic net inactivation results
in many compensatory changes in the noradrenergic system,
including a downregulation of  xxxg2276xxx  (the ratelimiting enzyme in ne synthesis; nestler et al 1990), burst firing
of the locus coeruleus (lc; the major brain noradrenergic
nucleus; grant and weiss 2001), the net (benmansour et al
1999; invernizzi and garattini 2004; weinshenker et al 2002b),
and adrenergic receptors (bergstrom and kellar 1979; xu et al
2000). thus, despite elevated basal extracellular ne levels, net
blockade may result in an overall decrease in ne signaling under
some conditions.
interestingly, the only net inhibitor we examined that did
not reduce sla was bup, which also blocks dat. bupropion
increased sla in a novel environment when given acutely in
both control strains tested. when given chronically, bup also
increased sla in both a novel environment and during the
dark phase in a familiar environment in wt c57bl6/j mice,
but had no effect on activity in dbh ⫹/⫺ mice (mixed
c57bl6/j and 129svev). this difference is not surprising, as
strain differences in dopaminergic sensitivity and signaling are
well documented (e.g., he and shippenberg 2000; kuzmin
and johannson 2000; womer et al 1994). the locomotorstimulating effects of acute and chronic bup in a novel
environment persisted in net ko mice, indicating that the
net is not required for this effect. because da is a potent
enhancer of locomotor activity and bup has amphetaminelike stimulant properties (tucker and file 1986), we hypothesized that simultaneous dat blockade may override the
attenuation of sla by net blockade. in support of this idea,
coadministration of rbx and the selective dat blocker gbr
12909 potently increased sla.
our results have potential clinical implications. alterations
(up or down) in psychomotor activity are a common hallmark
of a depressive state (sobin and sackeim 1997). because net
inhibitors given chronically decrease sla in mice, these
compounds might be useful for treating “agitated” depressive
individuals. interestingly, olfactory bulbectomized rats, a commonly used rodent model of depression, display hyperactive
exploratory behavior that is suppressed by chronic administration of net inhibitor antidepressants (harkin et al 1999). in
contrast, patients with depressed activity levels may wish to
avoid net inhibitors or use bup, which can increase psychomotor activity under some conditions.
