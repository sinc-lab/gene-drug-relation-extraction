the fibroblast growth factor (fgf)1 family constitute at
present 19 structurally related polypeptides mitogens. acidicfgf ( xxxg786xxx  or  xxxg786xxx ) and basic-fgf ( xxxg787xxx  or  xxxg787xxx ) are the
first isolated and best studied members of the fgf family (1,
2). they act on a wide spectrum of tissues and cell types, and
play important roles in a multitude of physiological and pathological processes including embryonal development, neuronal
survival, angiogenesis, wound repair, and tumor growth (1).
the keratinocyte growth factor (kgf or  xxxd2829xxx ) is unique
among fgfs in its specificity toward cells of epithelial origin
(3).  xxxd2829xxx  is secreted by stromal cells and it stimulates the
differentiation and proliferation of a large variety of epithelial
cells, acting as a paracrine mediator of mesenchymal-epithelial
communication (3).  xxxd2829xxx  is implicated in tissue development
and repair, and in a number of pathological conditions such as
prostate and breast cancer and inflammatory bowel disease
(3– 6).
the biological activities of fgfs are mediated by four distinct but highly related cell surface  xxxg2198xxx  receptors
(designated  xxxg791xxx - xxxg794xxx ). fgf receptors (fgfrs) display
overlapping ligand binding properties and alternative splicing
mechanism generates receptor isoforms with altered ligand
binding properties (2, 7).  xxxg786xxx  interacts with the four fgfrs
and the fgfr isoforms that have been characterized so far,
whereas  xxxd2829xxx  interacts only with an isoform of  xxxg792xxx  known
as fgfr2iiib form or the  xxxg792xxx  (8 –13). the  xxxg792xxx  is expressed predominantly in cells of epithelial origin and it binds
 xxxg786xxx  with an affinity similar to that observed for  xxxd2829xxx 
(14 –16).
beside interacting with fgfrs, fgfs bind to heparin and to
heparan sulfate moieties of cell surface and extracellular matrix heparan sulfate proteoglycans (hspg) (1, 17, 18). hspgs
and heparin are potent modulators of fgf activity. they can
protect fgfs from thermal denaturation and proteolytic degradation, and binding of fgf to extracellular matrix hspgs
provides a reservoir from which fgfs can be rapidly released
in response to specific triggering events (19 –21). in the absence
of cell surface hspgs, cellular responses to fgfs are attenuated but can be restored by the addition of heparin or hs,
indicating that these gags can enhance fgf receptor binding
and signaling (22, 23). studies with  xxxg787xxx  and  xxxg791xxx  suggested that heparin interacts with both the growth factor and
its receptor to stimulate cellular responses to fgf (24, 25).

the keratinocyte growth factor (kgf or  xxxd2829xxx ) is
unique among its family members both in its target cell
specificity and its inhibition by the addition of heparin
and the native heparan-sulfate proteoglycan (hspg),
glypican-1 in cells expressing endogenous hspgs.
 xxxg786xxx , which binds the  xxxd2829xxx  receptor with a similar
affinity as  xxxd2829xxx , is stimulated by both molecules. in the
present study, we investigated the modulation of  xxxd2829xxx 
activities by heparin and glypican-1 in hs-free background utilizing either hs-deficient cells expressing the
 xxxd2829xxx  receptor (designated baf/ xxxg792xxx  cells) or soluble
extracellular domain of the receptor. at physiological
concentrations of  xxxd2829xxx , heparin was required for high
affinity receptor binding and for signaling in baf/ xxxg792xxx 
cells. in contrast, binding of  xxxd2829xxx  to the soluble form of
the receptor did not require heparin. however, high
concentrations of heparin inhibited the binding of
 xxxd2829xxx  to both the cell surface and the soluble receptor,
similar to the reported effect of heparin in cells expressing endogenous hspgs. the difference in heparin dependence for high affinity interaction between the cell
surface and soluble receptor may be due to other molecule(s) present on cell surfaces. glypican-1 differed from
heparin in that it stimulated  xxxg786xxx  but not  xxxd2829xxx  activities in baf/ xxxg792xxx  cells. glypican-1 abrogated the stimulatory effect of heparin, and heparin reversed the inhibitory effect of glypican-1, indicating that this hspg
inhibits  xxxd2829xxx  activities by acting, most likely, as a competitive inhibitor of stimulatory hspg species for
 xxxd2829xxx . the regulatory effect of glypican-1 is mediated at
the level of interaction with the growth factor as glypican-1 did not bind the  xxxg792xxx . the effect of heparin and
glypican-1 on  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx  oligomerization was
studied employing high and physiological concentrations of growth factors. we did not find a correlation
between the effects of these glycosaminoglycans on
fgfs biological activity and oligomerization. altogether, our findings argue against the heparin-linked
dimer presentation model as key in fgfr activation,
and support the notion that hspgs primarily affect high
affinity interaction of fgfs with their receptors.

heparin and glypican-1 modulation of  xxxd2829xxx  activity

experimental procedures

materials—human recombinant  xxxd2829xxx  was produced in bacteria
and purified as described previously (32). for the preparation of heparin-free  xxxd2829xxx  we utilized a hexahistidine-tagged  xxxd2829xxx . the gene
encoding human  xxxd2829xxx  (residues ala31 to thr194) was cloned into plasmid pkm260 and expressed as his-tagged products in escherichia coli
(49, 51). expression of the recombinant proteins and preparation of the
soluble fraction was performed as previously described (50). purification was carried out by nickel  xxxd2739xxx  affinity chromatography essentially as recommended by the manufacturer (qiagen). the
receptor binding affinity and mitogenic activity of the his-tagged  xxxd2829xxx 
are identical to those of the parental molecule lacking the tag. the
purification and the biological properties of the his-tagged  xxxd2829xxx  are
described elsewhere (37). bovine brain  xxxg786xxx  was purchased from r &
d systems. bovine lung-derived heparin was from sigma. heparinsepharose was from amersham pharmacia biotech. carrier-free na125i
and [35s]na2so4 were purchased from nen life science products.
microtiter elisa plates were from corning. tissue culture media, sera,
and cell culture supplements were from biological industries (bethhemeek, israel) or from life technologies, inc. disuccinimidyl suberate
was obtained from pierce chemical co. all other chemicals were purchased from sigma.
cells—rat myoblast cells (l6e9) were grown in dulbecco’s modified
eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum as described previously
(11). the lymphocytic cell line baf3 was grown in rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 10%  xxxg1177xxx  conditioned medium
from wehi-3b cells (27). nih3t3 cells were grown in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium containing 10% newborn calf serum.
expression of  xxxg792xxx  in baf3 cells (baf/ xxxg792xxx  cells)—cells were
transfected by electroporation (960 microfarads, 240 v) with pcev
plasmid bearing the mouse  xxxg792xxx  gene (13) and selected with  xxxg418xxx 
(500 mg/ml) plus  xxxg1177xxx  conditioned medium. mass cultures of resistant
cells were then grown in the presence of  xxxg786xxx  (10 ng/ml) plus heparin
(3 mg/ml) without  xxxg1177xxx . this process yielded mass cultures expressing
significantly higher levels of  xxxg792xxx  (designated baf/ xxxg792xxx  cells) compared with cells grown with  xxxg418xxx  and  xxxg1177xxx  containing medium (data
not shown).
construction and production of soluble human  xxxg792xxx  ( xxxg792xxx /
ap)—a cdna fragment encoding the entire extracellular domain of the
mouse  xxxg792xxx  (13) was cloned into the aptag vector to produce an
in-frame fusion of  xxxg792xxx  with secreted  xxxg149xxx 
(ap) (35). this plasmid was co-transfected with the selectable neor
marker into nih3t3 cells. conditioned medium from  xxxg418xxx -resistant
colonies was screened for ap activity. the clone that produced the
highest level of activity was expanded and used to purify the  xxxg792xxx /ap
fusion protein using  xxxg786xxx  affinity chromatography (34).

purification of glypican and quantitation of gag side chains—
glypican-1 was purified from salt extracts of subconfluent l6e9 cultures. affinity purification, estimation of hs content, and preparation
of free glypican-1 hs were done as described previously (34). the
concentration of glypican-hs was normalized relative to known concentrations of heparin. unless otherwise indicated, the experiments were
performed with intact glypican-1. in a previous study we showed that
intact glypican-1 or free hs derived from glypican-1 modulate similarly
the activities of fgfs (34).
radioiodination of hspgs and fgfs—purified glypican-1 and fgfs
were radioiodinated using chloramine t as described previously (11).
radiolabeled glypican-1 was separated from free iodine by chromatography on deae-sephacel, and radiolabeled fgfs were purified by
heparin-sepharose affinity chromatography (36). specific activities of
iodinated fgfs were in the range of 1–2.5 3 105 cpm/ng, and for
glypican-1, 6 –12 3 106 cpm/mg of hs.
cell surface receptor binding—fgf binding to baf3/ xxxg792xxx  cells
were performed essentially as described (11) except that the assay was
performed in suspension. briefly, 2.4 3 106 baf/ xxxg792xxx  cells in 0.4 ml of
binding buffer were incubated for 2 h at 4 °c in the presence of 8 ng/ml
radioiodinated growth factors. determination of specific binding and
cross-linking were done as described previously (11). ligand-receptor
complexes were resolved on 6% sds-page. equal amounts of total cell
lysates were loaded onto each lane.
cell free binding—solid phase binding assays were performed in
96-well elisa dishes as recently described (37). for binding of 125iglypican-1 to  xxxd2829xxx , 0.2 mg of  xxxd2829xxx  in coating buffer was adsorbed to
each well. for binding of radioiodinated  xxxg786xxx ,  xxxd2829xxx , or glypican-1 to
 xxxg792xxx /ap, wells were first coated with a monoclonal antibody against
alkaline phosphatase, then conditioned medium from nih3t3 cells
expressing  xxxg792xxx /ap (0.15 ap od units/min) was added to antibodycoated wells. specific binding was determined by subtracting counts/
min of samples incubated with 1 mg/ml unlabeled ligand from the
counts/min bound in the absence of unlabeled ligand. negative controls
included wells coated with bovine  xxxg124xxx  alone, without ap
antibody or  xxxg792xxx /ap. nonspecific binding was less than 10% of the
total binding. cross-linking experiments in solution were performed
with 2 ng/ml radioiodinated  xxxd2829xxx  or  xxxg786xxx  using affinity purified
 xxxg792xxx /ap, as described (34).
[3h]thymidine incorporation and cell proliferation assays—mitogenic assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates. baf/ xxxg792xxx 
cells were seeded at 2 3 104 cells/well in rpmi plus 10% fetal calf serum
and the desired concentrations of growth factors, heparin, or glypican-1.
[3h]thymidine incorporation was assayed as described previously (34).
for proliferation assays, the cells were seeded into 24-well plates (5 3
104 cells/well). fresh growth factor and heparin were added every other
day and viable cells were counted on day 5 after seeding. each data
point was performed in duplicates or triplicates and each experiment
was repeated at least 3 times. the variation between different experiments did not exceed 10%.
cross-linking of fgfs—each reaction contained either a mixture of
radiolabeled and unlabeled growth factor or radiolabeled growth factor
alone (see text), and increasing concentrations of glypican-1 or heparin.
the binding and cross-linking experiments were carried out in a volume
of 20 ml essentially as described by ornitz et al. (27). samples were
separated on 12% sds-page and cross-linked fgfs were visualized by
autoradiography.
results

effect of heparin on receptor binding and mitogenic activity
of  xxxd2829xxx  and  xxxg786xxx  in hs-deficient cells expressing the
 xxxg792xxx —previous studies showed that heparin and cell surface
hspgs differentially modulate the activity of  xxxg786xxx  and
 xxxd2829xxx , enhancing the activity of  xxxg786xxx  but inhibiting that of
 xxxd2829xxx  (34, 38). to further investigate this differential effect of
hspgs on  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx  receptor binding and activation,
and to determine whether heparin can stimulate the activities
of  xxxd2829xxx  we ectopically expressed the  xxxg792xxx  in baf3 cells
(designated baf/ xxxg792xxx  cells). baf3 cells do not express hspgs
and fgfrs and therefore provide a useful model system to
study effects of heparin-like molecules (17, 27). we then compared the effect of heparin on receptor binding and mitogenic
activity of  xxxd2829xxx  and  xxxg786xxx  over a wide range of heparin
concentrations (0.05–100 mg/ml). binding of the radioiodinated
ligands to the  xxxg792xxx  was evaluated by covalent cross-linking.

this issue is controversial because different groups reported
conflicting results (26, 27). others suggested that interaction of
fgfs with hspgs increases their receptor binding affinity by
stabilizing growth factor-receptor complexes (28, 29). hspgs
and heparin may also facilitate fgfr dimerization and subsequent activation (26). the mechanism by which hspgs and
heparin stimulate receptor dimerization is controversial. two
models were proposed. in the first, the signal transducing
complex is composed of a 1:1 fgf/fgfr complexes crossbridged via hs or heparin, giving rise to a 2:2 molar ratio of
fgf to fgfr (26). the second model suggests that fgf induces receptor dimerization as a monomeric ligand and hspgs
stabilize the complex (30, 31).
the modulation of ligand-receptor interaction by hs/heparin
was mainly studied with  xxxg791xxx . less is known about how
these glycosaminoglycans modulate interaction of fgfs with
other fgfrs. previous studies revealed that heparin and the
native hspg glypican-1 are potent inhibitors of  xxxd2829xxx  activities when added to cells that respond to  xxxd2829xxx  and express
endogenous hspgs (32–34). this inhibitory effect was intriguing because both enhanced the interaction of  xxxg786xxx  with the
 xxxg792xxx  and  xxxg791xxx  (34). the present study was undertaken to
further characterize the involvement of heparin and glypican-1
in  xxxd2829xxx  and  xxxg786xxx  receptor binding and signaling by utilizing
both heparan sulfate-deficient cells expressing the  xxxg792xxx  and
soluble extracellular domain of the receptor.

heparin and glypican-1 modulation of  xxxd2829xxx  activity

as shown in fig. 1, heparin at concentrations ranging from
0.05 to 10 mg/ml dramatically enhanced the binding of both
 xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx  to the  xxxg792xxx . binding of  xxxg786xxx  reached a
maximal level at 1 mg/ml heparin (fig. 1a). quantitation of the
intensity of radioactivity in each band, in several different
experiments, revealed that 1 mg/ml heparin increases specific
binding of  xxxg786xxx  by 12–15-fold compared with the binding in
the absence of heparin. binding of 125i- xxxd2829xxx  to  xxxg792xxx  reached
a maximal level (about 12-fold increase)  xxxd1891xxx  mg/ml (fig. 1b).
higher concentrations of heparin differentially affected binding of each ligand to the  xxxg792xxx , stimulating that of  xxxg786xxx  but
strongly inhibiting that of  xxxd2829xxx . similar results were obtained using several different preparations of commercial heparin (data not shown). in addition, the effect of heparin on the
mitogenic activity of each growth factor correlated very well
with the observed effects on receptor binding (fig. 1c).
heparin enhances but is not essential for  xxxd2829xxx  activity—
the results presented in fig. 1 showed that at low concentration and in the absence of heparin,  xxxd2829xxx  did not stimulate a
mitogenic response in baf/ xxxg792xxx  cells. to further characterize
the effect of heparin, we examined whether higher concentrations of  xxxd2829xxx  can stimulate cell proliferation in the absence of
heparin, utilizing  xxxd2829xxx  preparation that was not exposed to
heparin-sepharose (see “experimental procedures” and ref.
51). the assay was performed with increasing concentrations of
 xxxd2829xxx  (5–1000 ng/ml) and in the absence or presence of 1 mg/ml
heparin. physiological concentrations of  xxxd2829xxx  had little or no
effect on cell proliferation in the absence of heparin. by contrast, added heparin supported proliferation to a level equivalent to that observed with  xxxg1177xxx  (fig. 2). in the absence of
heparin, cells were capable of responding to  xxxd2829xxx  to a similar
maximal extent, but significantly higher concentrations of
growth factor were required. these findings suggest that although  xxxd2829xxx  can stimulate cell proliferation in the absence of
heparin, heparin is required to enhance the efficacy of the
growth factor.
glypican-1 does not enhance the activity of  xxxd2829xxx —because glypican-1 and heparin exert a similar inhibitory effect
on  xxxd2829xxx  activities in cells that naturally express  xxxg792xxx  and
hspgs, we investigated whether glypican-1 can also stimulate

fig. 2.  xxxd2829xxx  stimulates the proliferation of hs-deficient cells
expressing  xxxg792xxx  in the absence of heparin. baf/ xxxg792xxx  cells were
washed with phosphate-buffered saline and seeded at a density of 5 3
104 cells/well in 24-well plates in growth medium lacking  xxxg1177xxx . the cells
were grown in the presence of the indicated concentrations of  xxxd2829xxx 
with or without 1 mg/ml heparin. the number of viable cells in the
presence of  xxxg1177xxx  was 620,000 cells/well (about 12-fold stimulation).

and 125i- xxxd2829xxx  (panel a, bottom) in the presence of the indicated concentrations of affinity purified glypican-1 or heparin. specific binding

enhance the binding of 125i- xxxd2829xxx  to the  xxxg792xxx  over a wide
concentration range (0.01- 25 mg/ml) (fig. 3a, bottom, and data
not shown). similarly, glypican-1 did not enhance the mitogenic activity of  xxxd2829xxx  in baf/ xxxg792xxx  cells (fig. 3b). to ensure
that glypican-1 is biologically active we tested its effect on
receptor binding and mitogenic activity of  xxxg786xxx , as glypican-1
had a stimulatory effect on  xxxg786xxx  activities (34). glypican-1
enhanced the binding of  xxxg786xxx  to  xxxg792xxx  in all the concentrations that were tested (0.1–25 mg/ml). an 8-fold increase in
specific binding of  xxxg786xxx  was observed in the presence of 10
mg/ml glypican-1 compared with  xxxg786xxx  binding in the absence
of glypican-1 (fig. 3a, top). similarly, glypican-1 enhanced the
mitogenic activity of  xxxg786xxx  (fig. 3b). these results suggest
that the failure of glypican-1 to enhance  xxxd2829xxx  activities is an
intrinsic property of this hspg and point to an important
difference between the effect of glypican-1 and heparin on
 xxxd2829xxx  activities.

analysis of several different experiments revealed a dissociation constant of 0.6 –1 3 1029 m.
effect of glypican-1 and heparin on oligomerization of
 xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx —hs-induced oligomerization of fgfs is
thought to play a central role in increasing the affinity of fgfs
for their signaling receptors and in facilitating fgfrs dimerization and subsequent activation (39). therefore, we investigated whether the inability of glypican-1 to stimulate  xxxd2829xxx 
activities correlates with its effect on  xxxd2829xxx  oligomerization.
oligomerization was assessed by chemical cross-linking of
 xxxd2829xxx  to itself following incubation of fixed amounts of the
growth factor and increasing concentrations of glypican-1
(0.01–25 mg/ml) or heparin (0.01–50 mg/ml). similar to the
reported effect of heparin on  xxxg787xxx  oligonization (27), dimers
and trimers of  xxxd2829xxx  were efficiently induced by heparin using
a high concentration of  xxxd2829xxx  (13 mg/ml) (fig. 6a). interestingly, glypican-1 similarly induced  xxxd2829xxx  oligomerization,
even though this hspg does not stimulate  xxxd2829xxx  activity (fig.
6b). because the  xxxd2829xxx  concentration that gives rise to maximal biological response is lower by 3 orders of magnitude than

effect of glypican-1 on  xxxd2829xxx  activities in hs-deficient cells
together with its inhibitory activity in cells that naturally
respond to  xxxd2829xxx  (34), suggested that glypican-1 might act as
an antagonist of stimulatory species of hs toward  xxxd2829xxx . to
test this possibility, we examined whether glypican-1 can abrogate the stimulatory effect of heparin on binding of  xxxd2829xxx  to
the  xxxg792xxx . thus, 125i- xxxd2829xxx  was bound to baf/ xxxg792xxx  cells in
the presence of 1 mg/ml heparin and increasing concentrations
of glypican-1. as shown in fig. 4, glypican abrogated the stimulatory effect of heparin in a dose-dependent manner. quantification of the amount of bound 125i- xxxd2829xxx  revealed that glypican-1, at a concentration of 5 mg/ml, inhibited the binding of
 xxxd2829xxx  to the  xxxg792xxx  by about 60%, and binding was almost
completely abolished at 25 mg/ml. to find out whether heparin
can reverse the inhibitory effect of glypican, we performed the
assay in the presence of a fixed amount of glypican-1 and
increasing concentrations of heparin. as shown in fig. 4b,
addition of heparin reversed the inhibitory effect of glypican-1.
these findings suggest that glypican-1 acts most likely as a
competitive inhibitor of heparin.
soluble  xxxg792xxx  binds to  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx  but not to glypican-1—to examine whether apart from binding to  xxxd2829xxx , the
inhibitory effect of glypican-1 is mediated also via binding to
the  xxxg792xxx , we studied its interaction with the  xxxg792xxx  in a
cell-free system. the soluble extracellular domain of  xxxg792xxx  was
produced as a fusion protein with secreted human placental
alkaline phosphatase (designated  xxxg792xxx /ap). we first tested if
 xxxg792xxx /ap is functional by measuring its binding and crosslinking to  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx  in both solid phase and solution.
 xxxg792xxx /ap was adsorbed to elisa dishes coated with an antibody to alkaline phosphatase and used in a quantitative binding assay.  xxxg792xxx /ap binds efficiently to both  xxxg786xxx  and
 xxxd2829xxx . binding was specific, dose-dependent, and saturable
(fig. 5a). however, unlike the situation with the cell surface
receptor, high affinity binding was readily detected in the absence of heparin. similar results were obtained following heparinase treatment or high salt extraction to remove contaminating hspgs, and in cross-linking experiments performed in
solution with affinity purified  xxxg792xxx /ap (fig. 5a, inset, and
data not shown). low concentrations of heparin slightly enhanced the binding of  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx  to the receptor, and
high concentrations of heparin inhibited binding of  xxxd2829xxx  to
the  xxxg792xxx , similar to the situation in intact cells (table i).
we next utilized the solid phase binding assay to examine
whether the receptor can bind 125i-glypican-1. as shown in fig.
5b, glypican-1 at concentrations of 5–200 ng/ml did not bind
 xxxg792xxx . binding was not detected at concentrations of up to 2
mg/ml 125i-glypican before and after high salt wash (data not
shown). by contrast, as expected, glypican-1 binding to  xxxd2829xxx 
was readily detected and heparin displaced bound glypican-1
from  xxxd2829xxx  (fig. 5b). the binding of 125i-glypican-1 to  xxxd2829xxx

heparin and glypican-1 modulation of  xxxd2829xxx  activity

fig. 6. effect of glypican-1 and heparin on oligomerization of  xxxg786xxx  and
 xxxd2829xxx .  xxxd2829xxx  (panels a-d) and  xxxg786xxx 
(panels e-g) were incubated in the presence of the indicated concentrations of
heparin or glypican-1. incubation was
carried out for 1 h at room temperature
and the growth factors were cross-linked
with disuccinimidyl suberate as described
under “experimental procedures.” products were separated on 12% sds-page,
and the gels were dried and exposed to an
x-ray film. in panels a, b, e, and f, 13
mg/ml unlabeled growth factor were
mixed with 33 ng/ml corresponding 125ilabeled factor. in panels c, d, and g, the
experiments were performed with radiolabeled growth factor alone. the specific
activity of radioiodinated factors was
75,000 and 330,000 cpm/ng for  xxxd2829xxx  and
 xxxg786xxx , respectively.

discussion

previous studies on the modulation of  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx  activities by heparin and hspgs in cells expressing endogenous
hspgs revealed that heparin and hspgs potentiate the biological activity of  xxxg786xxx  but strongly inhibit the activity of  xxxd2829xxx 
(32–34). the findings that hs inhibit  xxxd2829xxx  activities was surprising in view of the well established heparin requirement of all
other fgfs. however, the interpretation of these results was
complicated due to possible effects of endogenous hspgs. we
thus studied the heparin requirements of  xxxd2829xxx  in a hs-free
setting utilizing the hs and fgfr-deficient cell line, baf3,
transfected with functional  xxxg792xxx . we show that the interaction
of  xxxd2829xxx  with the  xxxg792xxx  and its mitogenic activity are facilitated
by low concentrations of heparin. these findings suggest that
 xxxd2829xxx  does not inherently differ from other fgfs in its requirement for heparin and are in agreement with the conclusion of
jang et al. (40) based on studies with protamine sulfate.
consistent with the results in cells expressing endogenous
hspgs, high concentrations of heparin stimulated  xxxg786xxx  activities but strongly inhibited receptor binding and mitogenic activity of  xxxd2829xxx  in baf/ xxxg792xxx  cells, generating a biphasic doseresponse curve. the biphasic effect of heparin on  xxxd2829xxx  activities
can explain why a stimulatory effect was not observed in cells
expressing hspgs (34, 38). in these cells, endogenous hspgs
may be present at a concentration that confers full activity on
 xxxd2829xxx . therefore, the addition of heparin causes inhibition
rather than stimulation by bringing the overall local concentration of hs at the cell surface to a level that falls into the inhibitory phase of the dose-response curve. the biphasic effect of
heparin suggests that soluble heparin may interact with two
distinct sites (high and low affinity sites) within the growth

factor-receptor complex. the known binding affinity of  xxxd2829xxx  to
cell-associated hspgs (14, 38) suggests that the putative higher
affinity site resides within the growth factor. the lower affinity
site for heparin may reside either in the ligand or in the receptor.
two groups reported recently that the  xxxg792xxx  binds heparin with
low affinity (41, 42). however, the relevance of this binding to the
inhibition of  xxxd2829xxx  remains unclear because the conclusions of
the two studies were contradictory. further characterization of
heparin-binding domains in  xxxd2829xxx  and the receptor are required
to resolve this issue.
the soluble  xxxg792xxx , unlike the cell surface receptor did not
exhibit a strong heparin dependence for high affinity interaction with  xxxd2829xxx  or  xxxg786xxx . however, the effect of high concentrations of heparin was similar to that observed in intact cells.
these findings suggest that high affinity ligand binding is an
intrinsic property of the receptor, and that the difference between the hspg dependence of ligand binding to cell surface
versus soluble  xxxg792xxx  may be due to other molecules present on
cells. the apparent lack of heparin dependence for high affinity
binding conflict the results of hsu et al. (41) who reported that
 xxxd2829xxx  does not bind to soluble  xxxg792xxx  in the absence of heparin.
it is unlikely that the lack of heparin dependence of our soluble
receptor is due to contamination with hspgs, because binding
in solution was performed with purified receptor and binding in
solid phase was not affected following heparinase treatment or
high salt wash of the immobilized receptor. moreover, a bacterially expressed  xxxg792xxx  that was not exposed to heparin-sepharose during purification also binds  xxxd2829xxx  in the absence of
heparin.2 similar lack of heparin dependence for high affinity
binding was recently reported for soluble  xxxg792xxx  produced in
hs-negative cells (42).
the effects of heparin on fgfs activities and the mechanism
by which heparin exerts these effects have been extensively
studied. however, because cells express on their surfaces
hspgs and not heparin, it is critical to investigate how these
hspgs exerts their regulatory activity. previous study indicated that glypican-1, similar to heparin, differentially modulates cellular responsiveness to  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx  in cells expressing endogenous hspgs (34). our effort to explore how
glypican-1 inhibits  xxxd2829xxx  activities revealed an important dif2

amount of dimers was observed in the absence of added gags,
and this amount decreased rather than increased when either
heparin or glypican-1 was added (fig. 6, c and d). similarly,
both heparin and glypican-1 induced oligomerization of  xxxg786xxx 
when high concentrations of this growth factor were employed
(fig. 6, e and f).  xxxd1891xxx  ng/ml  xxxg786xxx , a very little amount of
dimers was induced at gags concentrations between 5 and 100
ng/ml, and higher gags concentrations inhibited dimer formation (fig. 6g, and data not shown). the biological activity of
radioiodinated ligands was identical to that of the unlabeled
ligands (data not shown).

ference between the mode of action of heparin and glypican-1,
as glypican-1 stimulated receptor binding and mitogenic activity of  xxxg786xxx , but not  xxxd2829xxx  in baf/ xxxg792xxx  cells. when added
together with heparin, glypican-1 abrogated the stimulatory
effect of heparin on binding of  xxxd2829xxx  to baf/ xxxg792xxx  cells, and
heparin could reverse the inhibitory effect of glypican-1. these
findings suggest that glypican-1 behaves as a competitive binding antagonist of endogenous stimulatory hspg species for
 xxxd2829xxx . it appears that the modulatory effects of glypican-1 are
mediated at the level of interaction with the growth factors, as
glypican-1 did not bind the  xxxg792xxx . this situation differs from
that reported for the interaction of  xxxg787xxx  with  xxxg791xxx , in
which heparin interacts with both the growth factor and the
receptor to elicit a regulatory response (24). similar to the
present findings, stimulation of  xxxg789xxx  activity by heparin appears to be mediated via binding to the growth factor alone
(25), implying that binding of hs to fgfrs may not be a
general mechanism by which hspgs stimulate cellular responses to fgfs.
among models proposed to explain how hs, fgf, and fgfr
interact to instigate a signal, the most prevalent is the dimer
presentation model. this model was initially based on the
observation that heparin can induce dimerization of  xxxg787xxx  and
 xxxg786xxx , and in recent years it received further support from
nmr and x-ray crystallography analysis (43, 44). the concentrations of growth factors and oligosaccharides employed in
these studies far exceeded those required for biological activity.
thus, a key question is whether oligomers are formed at physiological concentrations of fgf and heparin. different studies
have demonstrated that maximal oligomerization is induced
when the molar ratio of protein to heparin is about 10:1 (45,
46). in experiments performed in cultured cells, maximal biological response is observed at 1–10 ng/ml growth factor and
0.5–10 mg/ml heparin or hs. under these conditions one would
not expect the formation of oligomers because of the low protein
to heparin molar ratio. our results confirm this prediction, as
oligomers were not induced at physiological concentrations of
either  xxxd2829xxx  or  xxxg786xxx  and stimulatory concentrations of heparin. consistent with previously reported results, heparin efficiently induced oligomerization of the fgfs at high growth
factor concentrations. however, even under these conditions
we did not observe a good correlation between the hs dose
dependence for oligomerization and for biological activity.
thus, high concentrations of heparin stimulated cellular responses to  xxxg786xxx  but inhibited its oligomerization, and glypican-1 that differentially modulates  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx  activities, similarly induced their oligomerization. together, these
results argue against the dimer presentation model. while this
article was in preparation, pye and gallagher (47) reported
that a monomer of  xxxg787xxx  and hs is sufficient for biological
activity, and hsu et al. (41) showed that the stoichiometry of
fgf-7zkgfr complex is 1:2. in addition, in a different study
we found that certain mutations in  xxxd2829xxx  did not affect affinity
for heparin and receptor but reduced the biological activity,
suggesting a sequential model for  xxxg792xxx  dimerization similar
to that proposed for growth hormone and  xxxg787xxx  (31, 48, 51).
in summary, the present work indicates that heparin and
the native hspg glypican-1 modulate differently the interaction of  xxxd2829xxx  with its receptor as only heparin but not glypican-1 stimulated  xxxd2829xxx  receptor binding in hs-deficient cells
expressing the  xxxg792xxx . altogether, the observed effects of glypican-1 and heparin on receptor binding of  xxxd2829xxx  and  xxxg786xxx , on
mitogenic activity and growth factor oligomerization argue
against the heparin-linked dimer presentation model as key in
fgfr activation (39, 44), and support the notion that hspgs
primarily affect high affinity interaction of fgfs with their
