the structures of the catalytic domain of matrix metalloproteinase
12 in the presence of  xxxd66xxx  and n-isobutyl-n-[4methoxyphenylsulfonyl]glycyl hydroxamic acid have been solved
by x-ray diffraction in the crystalline state at 1.0 and 1.3-å resolution, respectively, and compared with the previously published
x-ray structure at 1.2-å resolution of the adduct with  xxxd287xxx .
the structure of the n-isobutyl-n-[4-methoxyphenylsulfonyl]glycyl
hydroxamic acid adduct has been solved by nmr in solution. the
three x-ray structures and the solution structure are similar but not
identical to one another, the differences being sizably higher in the
loops. we propose that many of the loops show a dynamical
behavior in solution on a variety of time scales. different conformations of some flexible regions of the protein can be observed as
‘‘frozen’’ in different crystalline environments. the mobility in
solution studied by nmr reveals conformational equilibria in
accessible time scales, i.e., from 10ⴚ5 s to ms and more. averaging
of some residual dipolar couplings is consistent with further
motions down to 10ⴚ9 s. finally, local thermal motions of each
frozen conformation in the crystalline state at 100 k correlate well
with local motions on the picosecond time scale. flexibility兾conformational heterogeneity in crucial parts of the catalytic domain
is a rule rather than an exception in matrix metalloproteinases, and
its extent may be underestimated by inspection of one x-ray
structure. backbone flexibility may play a role in the difficulties
encountered in the design of selective inhibitors, whereas it may
be a requisite for substrate binding and broad substrate specificity.

atrix metalloproteinases (mmps) are enzymes involved in
extracellular matrix degradation, which is a fundamental
step in many physiological processes like tissue remodeling and
repair (1, 2). most mmps are constituted by a prodomain that
is removed upon activation, a catalytic domain responsible for
hydrolytic activity, and a hemopexin-like domain that probably
plays a role in substrate recognition. in several pathologies
overexpression of mmps, or the misregulation of their activity,
is related to disease progression (3–5). mmps thus are validated
pharmaceutical targets. many efforts have been devoted to
develop inhibitors against these metalloenzymes (6) through
rational drug design approaches, which require a detailed knowledge of the structural features of the active sites (7, 8). up to
now, drug candidates have failed the clinical trials, often because
of side effects probably caused by their low selectivity (9, 10).
over the years, it has become evident that, besides their
intrinsic similarity, mmps exhibit some capability of adapting
the binding pocket to the inhibitor shape (11), thus suggesting
another rationale for the lack of inhibitor selectivity. a more
detailed picture of mobility of mmps, its origin, and its implications for substrate and inhibitor binding would be extremely
helpful at this point. with this in mind, we have used an
integrated approach conjugating high-resolution x-ray structures
and nmr structures to analyze the mobility of a macrophage

metalloelastase ( xxxg1421xxx ) and performed a systematic comparison with several other mmps. the major finding is that there are
certain loop regions that are subject to mobility and兾or conformational heterogeneity in several mmps. some of these regions
are known to be implicated in substrate and inhibitor binding,
substrate recognition, and selectivity toward physiological and
nonphysiological inhibitors. it is also apparent that a number of
structural models are necessary to characterize a single mmp.
materials and methods
protein cloning and expression. a form of the catalytic domain of

 xxxg1421xxx , corresponding to the stretch gly-106–gly-263 with one
additional methionine at position 105 and a phe-171–asp mutation, has been cloned and expressed as reported (12). after the
refolding procedure, the catalytic domain was inhibited with
either the strong inhibitor  xxxd1109xxx  (n-isobutyl-n-[4-methoxyphenylsulphonyl]glycyl hydroxamic acid; kd ⫽ 10 nm) or the
weak inhibitor aha ( xxxd66xxx ; kd ⫽ 8 mm) by a
multistep dialysis procedure. the details for the measurements
of kd are reported in supporting text, which is published as
supporting information on the pnas web site.
crystallization, data collection, and resolution of the crystal structures. for  xxxg1421xxx –aha adduct an aliquot of 2 ␮l of protein

solution (10 mm tris兾5 mm cacl2兾0.1 mm zncl2兾300 mm

buffer (0.1 m tris䡠hcl兾25% peg 6000兾200 mm aha, ph 8).
the final protein concentration was 8 mg兾ml. crystallization was
carried out with the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at
20°c. for  xxxg1421xxx – xxxd1109xxx  adduct, 3 mm of  xxxd1109xxx  was added
to protein solution before mixing with a reservoir buffer containing 0.1 m tris䡠hcl, 20% peg 6000, 200 mm aha, and 1.0

the data were measured for both data sets at the elettra

(for mobility measurements) samples of  xxxg1421xxx –
 xxxd1109xxx  were 0.9 and 0.6 mm, respectively. the ph was adjusted
to 7.2.
all nmr experiments for protein assignment, structure calculation, and mobility measurements were acquired on bruker
avance 900, avance 800, avance 700, and drx 500
spectrometers. all instruments were equipped with a triple
resonance (txi) 5-mm probe with a z axis pulse field gradient,
and the 500-mhz spectrometer was equipped with a triple
resonance cryo-probe. all nmr experiments were performed at 298 k. a detailed description of nmr experiments is
reported in supporting text and tables 3–10, which are published
as supporting information on the pnas web site.
the program dyana (13) was used to calculate a family of 200
structures starting from randomly generated conformers in
10,000 annealing steps. the quality of the structures calculated
by dyana can be assessed by a properly defined energy function
(target function) proportional to the squared deviations of the
calculated constraints from the experimental ones, plus the
standard covalent and nonbonded energy terms. the programs
molmol (14) and procheck (15, 16) were subsequently used for
secondary structure analysis and structural quality. the final
family of 20 conformers was averaged and subjected to restrained energy minimization with amber 6.0 (17).
results and discussion
the crystal structures of the aha and  xxxd1109xxx  adducts of
 xxxg1421xxx  have been determined at 100 k and 1.0- and 1.3-å
resolution, respectively. the structure of the latter adduct has
been also determined by nmr in solution at room temperature
[target function 1.07 ⫾ 0.10 å2, backbone (bb) rms deviation

fold is very similar (but not identical with total bb rmsd ⫽ 1.37
å; ␣-helices and ␤-sheets bb rmsd ⫽ 0.65 å; the similarity
being sizably lower in the loops with bb rmsd ⫽ 1.64 å). the
x-ray structure of the  xxxd1109xxx  adduct is shown in fig. 1a. both
 xxxg1421xxx  complexes display the classical structure of metalloproteinases (18, 19), which consist of three ␣-helices, a twisted
five-stranded ␤-sheet, and eight intervening loops (l1–l8) of
which l5 and l8 are very long. the resulting topology is
l1-␤1-l2-␣1-l3-␤2-l4-␤3-l5-␤4-l6-␤5-l7-␣2-l8-␣3, where
the five-stranded twisted ␤-sheet is formed by ␤2-␤1-␤3-␤5-␤4.
in both structures three calcium-binding sites lie approximately
in the plane of the ␤3, ␤5, and ␤4 strands of the ␤-sheet and are
bound to residues from the ␤-turns of the sheet (fig. 1 a). the
catalytic zinc ion (zn1) is bound to the active-site cleft between
the ␤-sheet and loop l8. the zinc is five-coordinate, the ligands
being the his-218 n␧2, his-222 n␧2, his-228 n␧2 atoms, and
the two oxygen atoms of the chelating hydroxamate moiety of the
aha inhibitor (fig. 1b) or the  xxxd1109xxx  inhibitor (fig. 1c). the
second zinc ion (zn2) is bound in a tetrahedral geometry by
his-168 n␧2, asp-170 o␦1, his-183 n␧2, and his-196 n␦1.
the aha adduct is a close analog to a noninhibited mmp, as
the small aha molecule only interacts with the catalytic zinc ion
and its immediate neighbors. the two oxygens of aha bind the
catalytic zn at a distance of ⬇2.1 å (fig. 1b). the aha co
oxygen is 2.9 å from his-228 n␧2, 3.1 å from his-222 n␧2, and
bertini et al.

3.0 and 3.1 å from two water molecules; the aha noh oxygen
is 2.9 å from his-218 n␧2, 2.5 å from glu-219 o␦1, 3.2 å from
his-222 n␧2, and 3.0 å from a water molecule. the aha
nitrogen is 2.9 å from ala-182 o.
the binding mode of the  xxxd1109xxx  inhibitor is similar to that
recently reported for  xxxg1419xxx  (19). the interaction of the
inhibitor with the active site is limited to the zn1 ion and the s1⬘
subsite (the latter formed by loop l8 and the beginning of strand
␤4). in addition to the metal chelation,  xxxd1109xxx  is held in the
active site by h bonds and hydrophobic interactions (fig. 1c).
the hydroxamic acid head chelates the zinc ion and is further
involved in two h bonds. the protonated oxygen atom (o4), in
addition to the zinc coordination, donates a strong h bond to the
carboxylate o␧2 of glu-219 (2.4 å) (fig. 1c). in other hydroxamate-inhibited mmps this distance ranges from 2.7 to 3.1 å. in
contrast, the carbonyl hydroxamate oxygen o5 of  xxxd1109xxx  is not
involved in any h bond, whereas the hydroxamate nh has
significant electrostatic interaction with the ala-182 carbonyl
oxygen. the  xxxd1109xxx  sulfonyl oxygen o2 makes an important
contribution to inhibitor binding energy by establishing h bonds
with leu-181 n. finally, the phenolic methylether group of
 xxxd1109xxx  is inserted in the s1⬘ pocket. a water molecule is buried
in the pocket and makes a weak h bond with the methylether
oxygen of the inhibitor.
conformational heterogeneity and mobility of  xxxg1421xxx . the present

x-ray data at 1.0- and 1.3-å resolution, together with the
structure at 1.2-å resolution of the  xxxd287xxx  adduct of  xxxg1421xxx 
(20), constitute a set of extremely high-resolution structures that
are unique among all mmps. moreover, the structure of the
aha adduct is particularly interesting, as it shows the protein
without any exogenous ligand in the s1⬘ site. a comparison of
these three structures should thus allow a direct assessment of
the flexibility of the hydrophobic ligand binding pocket, and
possibly other parts of the molecule, as a function of the presence
and type of the exogenous ligand. the least-squares superposition between  xxxg1421xxx –aha and  xxxg1421xxx – xxxd1109xxx  yields a global
bb rmsd of 0.45 å, and no regions where the rmsd goes
beyond 1.2 å (fig. 2a). the least-squares superposition between
 xxxg1421xxx –aha and  xxxg1421xxx – xxxd287xxx  (pdb id code 1jk3)
yields a global bb rmsd of 0.46 å; however, there are two
narrow regions in which the deviation is significantly high: region
170–173 where it goes up to 2 å, and region 245–248 where it
goes up to ⬇4 å (fig. 2b). finally, the least-squares superposition between  xxxg1421xxx – xxxd1109xxx  and  xxxg1421xxx – xxxd287xxx  gives a
somewhat higher bb rmsd of 0.62 å. the rmsd goes up to
⬇1.3 å in region 153–157, ⬇2.0 å in region 168–172, between
1 and 1.5 å in region 230–234, and up to 3 å in region 245–248
(fig. 2c). because of the extremely high resolution of the three
structures (rmsd on atomic positions between 0.03 and 0.07 å),
any deviation among atomic coordinates of different molecules
⬎0.5 å (a conservative estimate) is meaningful and can be
analyzed in terms of molecular flexibility.
we should first of all comment on the discrepancy between the
present two structures and the  xxxd287xxx  adduct in region
168–174 (part of loop l5), which is not catalytically relevant. the
present  xxxg1421xxx  domain contains a phe-171–asp mutation
aimed at increasing its solubility (12). although this mutation
prevents us from attaching any functional significance to the
variability in this particular region, it serves the purpose of
illustrating how a single mutation on a surface residue may
translate into a relatively marked bb movement involving seven
residues of a loop region.
on the contrary, the differences observed in the other parts
of the molecule are certainly meaningful. the most striking is
that between the  xxxd287xxx  and the other adducts in the l8 loop
region (which constitutes a wall of the s1⬘ site) centered around
residues 245–248 (c-terminal part of the loop). it is possible that

c the ligand electron densities are also shown.

this difference is caused by a different mode of interaction of the
hydrophobic part of the ligand (an isopropyl for  xxxd287xxx  vs. a
methoxyphenyl for  xxxd1109xxx , and no hydrophobic moiety at all for
aha). however, residues 245–248 are located very far from the
entrance of the s1⬘ site and certainly out of reach for the
relatively short hydrophobic parts of either  xxxd287xxx  or
 xxxd1109xxx .
other differences are observed between  xxxd1109xxx  and the other
two structures in loop regions 110–116 (l1⫹␤1), 146–157
(l3⫹␤2⫹l4), 176–180 (c-terminal part of loop l5), 206–209
(part of loop l7), and 230–236 (central part of loop l8) (fig.
1 a). in all cases, these differences are unrelated to the different
inhibitor bound to the protein. we can conclude that the
conformational heterogeneity observed among these three highresolution  xxxg1421xxx  structures is largely independent of the

presence and type of inhibitor, with the possible exception of the
245–248 region. other x-ray structures of  xxxg1421xxx  where the s1⬘
pocket is occupied by the side chains of methionines bound in a
product-analog mode (18) (protein data bank id codes 1os2
and 1os9) show that even with the same moiety bound to the s1⬘
site, the 245–248 (c-terminal part of loop l8) region still shows
conformational heterogeneity.
fig. 3a shows the rmsd per-residue of the family of the nmr
structures of  xxxg1421xxx – xxxd1109xxx . it is apparent that there are
several disordered regions in the structure of the above adduct
in solution. disorder in nmr-derived structures arises from the
lack of medium- to long-range nuclear overhauser effects
(noes), which in turn may be caused by low data quality and兾or
severe overlap of noesy cross peaks or intrinsic lack of noes
caused by mobility. careful inspection of the 2d and 3d noesy

spectra clearly shows that in all disordered regions medium- to
long-range noes are indeed present, but the intensity of those
arising from side chains is far too small compared with the
expectations from the present x-ray and solution structures. also
the noes arising from bb nhs are reduced, mostly because the
nh signals are reduced in intensity due to partial exchange with
water protons, whereas the short-range noes arising from bb
h␣ are of approximately normal intensity. small noes typically
arise from equilibrium among different conformations, which
rapidly quenches the overhauser effect of the involved protons.
we conclude that disorder in the solution structure of  xxxg1421xxx –
 xxxd1109xxx  is indeed largely caused by protein mobility.
a comparison of figs. 2 and 3a shows that there is a
remarkable correspondence between protein loop regions that
show conformational heterogeneity among different structures
in the solid state and loop regions that are mobile in solution.
this correspondence allows us to draw further conclusions on
the motions that characterize these loops. from the nmr point
of view, the fact that mostly side-chain noes are strongly
reduced in intensity indicates that the side chains are very
mobile. in turn, this feature means that there are little or no
contacts between these side chains and other parts of the protein.
likewise, partial exchange of nh protons is also indicative of the
absence of hydrogen bonds involving bb nhs, whereas the few
short-range noes involving h␣ protons are of normal intensity.
collectively, these findings mean that there are little energetic
constraints that can define the conformational preferences of
these loops.
residual dipolar couplings (rdcs) are potentially sensitive
indicators of the presence of mobility on any submillisecond time
scale (21), giving rise to reduction in rdc absolute values upon
conformational averaging, provided that the spanned conformations differ sensibly in their rdcs. accordingly, several
measured rdcs are smaller in absolute values than the calculated ones, particularly at the hinges between loops and elements
of secondary structure (i.e., between ␤1 and l2 and l2 and ␣1,

before and after ␤2, and in loops l5 and l7). finally, seven of
nine residues in the c-terminal part of loop l8 also exhibit
quenched rdc values.
all of these observations suggest, although they do not prove,
the presence of ample motions of each loop as a whole. from the
x-ray point of view, the high resolution of all of the loop regions
shows that both static and dynamic disorder is small within each
structure in the solid state, and the comparison of the different
structures fully enlightens the conformational heterogeneity. it
is likely that what we observe in solution are motions that sample
within each molecule a conformational space that has an amplitude similar to that sampled by different molecules in different
crystalline environments.
time scales of mobility. protein motions occur on a variety of

different time scales, from nanosecond to picosecond ranges
typical of local motions involving few atoms, to microseconds for
conformational changes involving protein segments, and to
milliseconds or longer for very large interdomain motions or, for
example, cis-trans proline isomerizations. to better characterize
the time scales of the present mmp dynamics we have performed
heteronuclear r1, r2, and noe measurements (fig. 4, which is
published as supporting information on the pnas web site) and
carr–purcell–meiboom–gill and off-resonance r1␳ experiments. we have also detected and analyzed a number of signal
pnas 兩 april 12, 2005 兩 vol. 102 兩 no. 15 兩 5337

splittings that witness the presence of conformations that interconvert on a time scale of tens of milliseconds or longer.
the analysis of 1h-15n relaxation data (fig. 4) shows values in
the normal range for a protein of the size of  xxxg1421xxx  at room
temperature. the r2兾r1 ratio indicates the protein to be monomeric; only two r2 values (his-172 and ile-191) exceed the
average value significantly, already indicating that there are no
extensive regions of the protein undergoing motions on the
millisecond time scale. carr–purcell–meiboom–gill measurements provide a semiquantitative estimate of the time scale of
the motions experienced by residue ile-191 (252 ⫾ 41 ␮s),
whereas from off-resonance r1␳ experiments we could evaluate
a ␶ex for his-172 of 117 ⫾ 22 ␮s. 15n noes for most residues
belonging to secondary structure elements are also within the
expected range for a well folded, rigid protein. on the other
hand, 15n noes for residues in the loop regions are systematically lower, but still normal for nh groups of loops when not
involved in hydrogen bonds. the lower noe values for loop nhs
are ascribed (22–25) to local motions occurring on the nanosecond time scale or shorter. as such, the decrease in the noes
should correspond to an increase of the group average temperature factors obtained from the x-ray structure (26, 27). indeed,
the correspondence between these two parameters is very good
(see fig. 5, which is published as supporting information on the
pnas web site).
by analyzing in detail the splitting of 1h-15n heteronuclear
single-quantum coherence (hsqc) signals in the light of the
atomic resolution x-ray structures it appears that in most cases
signal splitting is paralleled by local conformational heterogeneity of protein side chains and not of the bb, because the rdc
values of both components (where measurable) are never strikingly different. resonance splitting for bb amides is clearly
observed in 1h-15n hsqc and 1h-15n hsqc–noesy spectra
in the case of residues 171–173 (on loop l5), 188–193 (on loop
l6), and 217–240 (n-terminal part of loop l8). in the x-ray
structure, side-chain conformational heterogeneity is found for
two of these three protein fragments. for example, in the  xxxd1109xxx 
adduct, double conformation is observed for bb n of residue 170
and bb carbonyl of glu-219 and ile-220 that belong to helix ␣2,
as well as for the side chain of tyr-239 in loop l8; other side
chains in the same loop (residues 229, 233, 241, 245–247, and
249) appear very disordered. the x-ray structure of the aha
adduct shows very similar behavior. it should be noted that loop
l5 contains the mutation phe-171–asp. as discussed, residues
171–173 have double conformation. notably, the preceding
residues 167–170 have bb nhs that could not be detected in
hsqc spectra. exchange phenomena on the time scale of tens
to hundreds of ␮s are detected for residues ala-164, his-172,
phe-174, asp-175, gly-178, and ile-180, as it results from
carr–purcell–meiboom–gill and r1␳ measurements. this finding is consistent with differential mobility along this loop: on the
submillisecond scale for the hinge with ␤3, intermediate exchange, which causes line broadening beyond detection, for
residues 167–170, ⬎10 ms for residues 171 and 173, and again on
the submillisecond time scale for the c terminal. notably, the
second part of loop l8, which does not show double conformation, is characterized by sizably low values of the experimental
rdc with respect to the expectation, suggesting mobility on the
submillisecond time scale. for the c-terminal part of loop l8,
seven of nine rdcs are smaller in absolute value than the
calculated ones (fig. 6, which is published as supporting information on the pnas web site). the motions experienced by
these residues are neither in the very slow subsecond range (with
the exception of residue 241 that shows evidence of conformational exchange from r1␳), nor in the subnanosecond range
(again, no dramatic decrease of 15n noes).
by recalling that (i) the proton–proton noes in the loop
regions are very small in the side chains because of large mobility
5338 兩 www.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0407106102

and scarcity of long-range contacts, (ii) the noes involving nh
groups are only somewhat smaller than expected because of
partial exchange of nh protons, (iii) the noes involving h␣
protons are generally of normal intensity, and (iv) the measured
rdcs for signals that do not show double conformation on the
nmr time scale are sizably smaller than the expected ones, the
picture that emerges is that at least the c-terminal part of loop
l8 may undergo relatively wide but collective bb motions. we
are left with a still relatively wide time window extending
between ⬇10⫺5 and 10⫺9 s for the motions that cause reduction
of the rdc values in the c-terminal part of loop l8. the higher
end of this window is perfectly consistent with motions that are
ample enough to encompass the 1–4 å of both the rmsd
between loops in different x-ray structures (fig. 2) and the
rmsd in the loop regions of the structure family in solution.
other mmps. it is worth attempting a comparative analysis of the

published x-ray and nmr structures of other human mmps. so
far, nmr data exist for  xxxg1418xxx  (28),  xxxg1428xxx  (29),  xxxg1437xxx 
(30–32),  xxxg1421xxx  (this work), and  xxxg1422xxx  (33, 34). in some
cases the issue of mobility has been specifically addressed, in
some others it has not. in any case, the families of structures
deposited in the protein data bank for all of the above molecules
turn out to be instructive. fig. 3 shows a collection of bb rmsd
per residue for each nmr structure family. all structures have
been realigned by using structure-based rather than sequencebased algorithms. it is apparent, beyond uncertainty, that all
profiles are remarkably similar, with similar increases in disorder
in the same loop regions for all of these mmps. the qualities of
the various structures differ, but even the best ones show the
same trend, confirming that disorder is indeed caused by an
intrinsic high mobility of the loop regions of mmps. many
different protein data bank entries for x-ray structures of the
same mmp are available for  xxxg1418xxx ,  xxxg1437xxx , and  xxxg1422xxx . for
 xxxg1418xxx  and  xxxg1437xxx  again relatively high rmsd between the
different structures is obtained, corroborating the present conclusions. the rmsds are instead small for the different  xxxg1422xxx 
structures, and there are at least three loop regions that are
disordered in solution (fig. 3 g and h). it is possible that for
 xxxg1422xxx  one conformation is more energetically favored that the
others, and the crystallization process always freezes the same
seemingly ordered structure.
summary considerations. in this article, the solution structure of

an adduct of  xxxg1421xxx  has been analyzed in terms of conformational exchange of loops in time scales not directly available
through nmr experiments (microseconds to nanoseconds).
however, the exchange is supported by the different ‘‘frozen’’
conformations displayed by three x-ray structures, two of them
being solved during this research, and also by the reduction of
several rdc values in solution. the different frozen conformations provide an estimate of the amplitude of the conformational
motions. it appears that this property is characteristic of many,
if not all, mmps. this research shows the power of coupling x-ray
structures (possibly more than one) and the solution structure,
the latter with an analysis of noe intensities, rdc values, and
relaxation properties, to obtain a structural model that is beyond
a single structural datum. the adaptability of loops (and cavities
whose walls are constituted by loops) to ligands and other
external perturbations are a further challenge to drug discovery
bioinformatic procedures, as these slow-exchanging conformations should be sampled before the interaction with the ligand is
studied.
