t h e effects of the selective pi-adrenergic receptor blocking agents,  xxxd2991xxx  with intrinsic sympathetic
activity (isa) and metoprolol without isa, were studied on qt interval, heart rate, arterial pressure and
cardiac arrhythmias during the induction of anaesthesia in 142 adults.' i n the control group, the qt interval
was statistically significantly prolonged after thiopental, and the most marked prolongation occurred after
suxamethonium. neither  xxxd2991xxx  nor metoprolol alone affected the qt interval.  xxxd2991xxx  100 pg/kg i.v.,
but not 40 or 150 pg/kg i.v., almost completely reduced the prolongation of the qt interval after suxamethonium. i n all doses of 20, 30 and 40 pg/kg i.v. metoprolol statistically significantly and dose-dependently
reduced the prolongation of the qt interval after thiopental, suxamethonium and laryngoscopy, but the
prolongation of the qt interval after intubation still occurred.  xxxd2991xxx  and metoprolol alone statistically
significantly reduced heart rate, but did not prevent the increase of heart rate after thiopental. t h e effects
on arterial pressure were minimal. neither  xxxd2991xxx  nor metoprolol prevented the cardiovascular intubation
response. ventricular ectopic beats after intubation occurred in 20% of the patients in the control group
and their incidence ranged from 20 to 27% in the groups pretreated with  xxxd2991xxx  or metoprolol 20 pg/kg.
in the groups pretreated with metoprolol 30 or 40 pg/kg, ventricular ectopic beats occurred in 5% and s%,
respectively. it is concluded that the selective pi-adrenergic receptor blocking agents  xxxd2991xxx  with isa,
and especially metoprolol without isa, reduced the prolongation of the qt interval after suxamethonium.
t h e results suggest that the prolongation of the qt interval after suxamethonium may be mediated by the
stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system caused by suxamethonium.

key words: induction o f anaesthesia; metoprolol;  xxxd2991xxx ; qt interval.

we have recently found that during anaesthetic induction the qt interval of the electrocardiogram (ecg)
was statistically significantly prolonged after thiopental, and the most marked prolongation occurred after
suxamethonium both in adults and in children (1).
pretreatment with d- xxxd3456xxx  statistically significantly prevented this prolongation as well as markedly
reduced the incidence of ventricular ectopic beats after
laryngoscopy and intubation (1).
both noradrenaline (2) and an imbalance in the
cardiac sympathetic tone (3-6) cause prolongation of
the qt interval. furthermore, there are syndromes of
prolonged qt interval (7-9) in which the association
between the prolonged qt interval and sympathetic
nervous system is supported by the fact that these
syndromes have been successfully treated with 0-adrenergic receptor blocking agents (10, l l ) , as well as
with a stellate ganglion block (3, 11-13). on this basis
the prolongation of the qt interval after suxamethon-

ium also might be the result of the stimulation of the
sympathetic nervous system caused by suxamethonium, since suxamethonium stimulates postganglionic
sympathetic nerve endings and myocardium and may
cause tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension (14). furthermore, quite recently nigrovic et al.
(15) have found that the concentration of noradrenaline in plasma of patients during anaesthetic induction
increased statistically significantly 2 min after the injection of suxamethonium.
the present work was designed to study the effect
of the selective pi-adrenergic receptor blocking agents,
 xxxd2991xxx  and metoprolol, on the qt interval during
anaesthetic induction.  xxxd2991xxx , but not metoprolol,
has some intrinsic sympathetic activity (16), whereas
neither  xxxd2991xxx  nor metoprolol has quinidine-like
activity (1 6). since quinidine prolongs the qt interval
( 17), 0-adrenerigc receptor blocking agents having
quinidine-like activity were not used.

patients and methods
t h e study was carried out in 142 adults undergoing otolaryngological
surgery. t h e characteristics of the patients are shown in table 1.
patients who were suffering from uncompensated cardiac insufficiency, atrioventricular conduction block, diabetes or bronchial asthma
were excluded from the study. t h e ethics committee of the department of otolaryngology approved the experimental protocol or the
study.
t h e patients were premedicated with pethidine 1 mg/kg and
atropine 0.01 mg/kg i.m. 45 min before induction of anaesthesia.
five min after the start of the injection of  xxxd2991xxx  (pralone' 2 mg/
ml injekt, medipolar, farmos-yhtyma, oy, oulu, finland) 40, 100
or 150 pg/kg i.v. or of metoprolol (selokena 1 mg/ml injekt, hassle,
molndal, sweden) 20, 30 or 40 fg/kg i.v., thiopental 5 mg/kg was
injected over 45 s.  xxxd2991xxx  and metoprolol were injected over 1
min. the control group was not pretreated with a j3-adrenergic
receptor blocking agent. intubation was facilitated with suxamethonium i mg/kg. the vocal cords were sprayed with 10% lidocaine
(about 50 mg) before intubation. during the induction procedure
the patients spontaneously breathed iooo;, oxygen until injection of
suxamethonium. thereafter, the patients were manually ventilated

the ecg lead -avr was continuously displayed on an oscilloscope and recorded a t a paper speed of 25 mmjs. t h e qt interval
was measured after venepuncture (control), 5 min after the start of
the injection of  xxxd2991xxx  or metoprolol, 45 s after the start of the
injection of thiopental, 30 s after the injection of suxamethonium
and immediately after laryngoscopy and intubation. the qt interval
was measured from the onset of the q r s complex to the end of the
t-wave.
in each case the mean qt interval of four successive beats was
determined. heart rate correction was made according to the formula: qtc =

anaesthetic induction were also analyzed from the same ecg recordings as the qt intervals.
student's t-test for both paired and unpaired data was used for
the statistical analysis of the results.

results
a t interval
in the control group the qt interval was statistically
significantly prolonged after thiopental and the most
marked prolongation occurred after suxamethonium.
neither laryngoscopy nor intubation significantly
affected the prolongation occurring after suxamethonium (fig. 1 and 2). the pi-adrenergic receptor blocking agents alone did not significantly affect the qt
interval.  xxxd2991xxx  100 pg/kg, but not 40 or 150 pg/
kg, statistically significantly and almost completely
reduced the prolongation of the qt interval after
suxamethonium (fig. 1). metoproiol in all doses used
statistically significantly and dose-dependently reduced the prolongation of the qt interval after thiopental, suxamethonium and laryngoscopy. in the cases
in which the prolongation of the qt interval was
reduced after suxamethonium, it still occurred after
intubation (fig. 2).

nificantly reduced heart rate but did not prevent the
increase of heart rate after thiopental. suxamethonium did not statistically significantly affect the values
after thiopental, and laryngoscopy did not significantly modify the values after suxamethonium, nor
did intubation affect the values following laryngoscopy
(table 2).
 xxxd2991xxx  and metoprolol alone did not change systolic or diastolic arterial pressures compared with the
corresponding values after venepuncture. both in the
control group and in the groups pretreated with  xxxd2991xxx  or metoprolol 20 or 30 pg/kg, systolic arterial
pressure decreased statistically but not clinically significantly after thiopental. diastolic arterial pressure
after thiopental decreased statistically but not clinically significantly only in the control group and in the
group pretreated with metoprolol 20 pg/kg. neither
 xxxd2991xxx  nor metoprolol prevented the cardiovascular
intubation response (tables 3 and 4).

which occurred in 20% of the patients in the control
group. the incidence of ventricular ectopic beats ranged from 5 to 27% in the groups treated with pladrenergic receptor blocking agents. none of the treated groups differed statistically significantly from the
control group. ventricular ectopic beats always occurred after laryngoscopy and intubation (table 5 ) .

discussion
the present results show that the selective pi-adrenergic receptor blocking agents,  xxxd2991xxx  100 pg/kg and
metoprolol in all doses used, statistically significantly
reduced the prolongation of the qt interval after
suxamethonium whereas prolongation of the qt
interval still occurred after intubation. both  xxxd2991xxx 
and metoprolol alone dose-dependently reduced heart
rate but did not prevent the cardiovascular intubation
response. metoprolol 30 and 40 pg/kg tended to reduce the frequency of ventricular ectopic beats after
laryngoscopy and intubation.

the qt interval after suxamethonium may support
the idea that this effect of suxamethonium is mediated
by the stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system
caused by suxamethonium (14, 15). in the cases in
which the prolongation of the qt interval did not
occur after suxamethonium, it still occurred after intubation. this prolongation may be due to the sympathetic stimulation caused by laryngoscopy and intubation (19). o n the basis of the present study, this stimulation may be stronger than that caused by
suxamethonium, so that the pi -adrenergic receptor
blocking agents in the relatively small doses used were
not able to reduce this stimulation similarly as they
were not able to reduce the cardiovascular intubation
response.
the finding that  xxxd2991xxx  neither in the lowest dose
of 40 pg/kg nor in the highest dose of 150 pg/kg
prevented the prolongation of the qt interval after
suxamethonium may be due to the fact that the lowest
dose was too low as regards pi-adrenergic receptor
blocking activity, whereas the highest dose might be
too high as regards the intrinsic sympathetic activity
which might prevent the effect of this dose.
the present results show that neither  xxxd2991xxx  nor
metoprolol clinically significantly affected the heart
rate or arterial pressure measured after thiopental,
suxamethonium or intubation. hence the drugs in the
doses used are safe during the induction of anaesthesia
in healthy, relatively young patients.
in the present study, neither  xxxd2991xxx  nor metoprolo1 prevented the cardiovascular intubation response.
this result agrees well with the results of werner et
al. (20) who also found that  xxxd2991xxx , at a higher
dosage than in the present study, did not prevent the
increase in arterial pressure after intubation although
the heart rate was reduced. in the same study (20),
oral metoprolol 0.2 g for 4 days before anaesthesia
reduced the level of arterial pressure both before and

648

l. saarnivaara et al

during anaesthesia, but the arterial pressure after intubation still increased although a t a lower level than
in the control group. prys-roberts (21), however,
found that high preoperative doses of p-adrenergic
receptor blocking agents effectively suppressed the cardiovascular intubation response. a contributing factor
to this suppression may be the induction of anaesthesia
with 8 pg/kg of fentanyl which in doses of 2 and 6 pg/
kg has been shown to attenuate the cardiovascular
intubation response (22). the differences between the
different studies may be the results of different doses
of p-adrenergic receptor blocking agents and of the
use of fentanyl.
in the present study, ventricular ectopic beats after
intubation occurred in 20% of the patients in the
control group and their incidence ranged from 20 to
27% in the groups treated either with different doses
of  xxxd2991xxx  or with metoprolo120 pg/kg. in the groups
pretreated with metoprolol 30 or 40 pg/kg, however,
ventricular ectopic beats occurred in only 5% and 8%
of the patients, respectively. the findings with the
higher doses of metoprolol agree well with the earlier
finding that metoprolol reduced the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias associated with dental surgery in halothane anaesthesia (23, 24) as well as supraventricular
tachyarrhythmias in nonsurgical patients (25). the
lack of effect of  xxxd2991xxx  in the present study is difficult
to explain, but it may be at least partly due to its
intrinsic sympathetic activity, although it has earlier
been shown to reduce cardiac arrhythmias during halothane anaesthesia for oral surgery (26).
