abstract.

we describe a rare case of macroprolactinoma with subclinically synchronous  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx  (gh)

production. a 59-year-old man with a giant adenoma in his pituitary had elevated serum prolactin (prl) and in-
sulin-like growth factor (igf)-i levels, despite normal levels of basal gh. serum gh levels were paradoxically in-
creased in response to an intravenous administration of  xxxg2328xxx  (trh). prolonged exposure
to glucose as a result of oral glucose tolerance testing (ogtt) failed to decrease gh levels. two-week treatment with
 xxxd400xxx , a dopamine  xxxg656xxx  agonist, decreased serum prl and gh levels, and size of the tumor. im-
munohistochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed prl-producing cells capable of synchronous gh production.
acidophilic stem cell adenoma may be responsible for these phenomena. the nature of high proliferation and in-
vasive tumor growth should be kept in mind when managing patients with this cell type of adenoma.  xxxg1144xxx  levels
should be followed in prloma, even when basal gh levels are within the normal range, because mixed prl- and
gh-producing tumors would lie underneath. further endocrinological examinations such as trh test and ogtt are

recommended when elevated  xxxg1144xxx  levels are detected.

(endocrine journal 49: 41-47, 2002)

individuals with acromegaly are hyperprolactinemic,
but even so a case of apparent prolactinoma with gh
mrna expression is quite rare. we herewith de-
scribe the nature of a multihormonal pituitary ade-
noma with predominant prl and subclinical gh
production. in our case, serum prl and insulin-like
growth factor (igf)-i levels were elevated, despite
normal levels of basal gh. gh levels were para-
doxically increased in response to  xxxd3368xxx -releas-
ing hormone (trh). immunohistochemistry and
in situ hybridization showed prl-producing cells
with synchronous gh production.

case report
clinical summary

in october, 2000, a 59-year-old man was referred
to our department for further evaluation of a giant
pituitary adenoma. on admission, his height was
171 cm, and body weight 81 kg with body mass index
of 28.0. blood pressure was 108/80 mmhg. he did
not complain of visual field defects, galactorrhoea,
impotence, headache, or enlargement of hands and
feet. he had no goiter or gynecomastia, and face
was not typically acromegalic, i.e., with deep naso-
labial furrows, thick lips, broad nose, or prominent
supraorbital ridge. heel pad thickness was 22 mm.
serum prl (528ng/ml; normal range: 3.4-16.2
ng/ml, enzyme immunoassay) and  xxxg1144xxx  levels (600
ng/ml; normal range: 59-215 ng/ml, immunoradio-
metric assay) were elevated, despite normal basal level
of serum gh (1.9 ng/ml; normal range: <3.1 ng/ml,
enzyme immunoassay). serum calcium, phosphorus,
and alkaline phosphatase were 8.9 mg/dl (normal
range: 8.2-10.2 mg/dl), 3.7 mg/dl (normal range: 2.5
-4.5mg/dl), and 265 tu/1 (normal range: 104-338
iu/l), respectively. as shown in table 1, serum gh
levels were paradoxically increased in response to in-
travenous administration of trh. both gh and
prl levels were enhanced in response to intravenous
administration of gh-releasing hormone ( xxxg930xxx )
(table 1d). prolonged exposure to glucose as a re-
sult of oral glucose tolerance testing (ogtt) failed to
decrease gh levels (table le). both adrenocortico-
tropic hormone (acth) and cortisol levels were
suppressed by dexamethasone (table 1f). magnetic
resonance imaging (mri) of the head revealed the
presence of a pituitary macroadenoma enclosing bi-
lateral carotid arteries (fig. 1). no visual defects
were detected by goldmann perimetry. cabergo-
line, a dopamine  xxxg656xxx  agonist, decreased both
serum prl and gh levels (table 1g). a two-week
treatment with  xxxd400xxx  (1 mg/day) decreased se-
rum prl and gh levels (53.8 ng/ml and 0.5 ng/ml,
respectively), and size of the tumor markedly. un-
der diagnosis of macroprolactinoma with gh pro-
duction, transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary
macroadenoma was performed. after operation, we
continued to treat the residual tumor with cabergo-
line.

pathological findings

light microscopic findings

the resected tissue in the pituitary was fixed in
10% formalin for 8h. serial sections were prepared
and stained with the hematoxylin-eosin (he). he
stained sections revealed a papillary structure con-
sisting of large cuboidal chromophobic cells with
slightly pleomorphic nuclei (fig. 2).

immunohistochemistry

for immunohistochemistry, tissue sections were
rinsed in 0.05 m phosphate-buffered saline (pbs).
sections were incubated in the following primary
antibodies raised in rabbit: anti-gh, prl (1:1,000,
dako, carpinteria, ca) in pbs with 0.4% triton
x-100 at room temperature for 1 h, followed by 4°c
for 24h. after the incubation, the tissues were
rinsed in pbs and incubated in biotinylated donkey
anti-rabbit igg (histofine kit, nichirei, tokyo,
japan) in pbs with 0.4% triton x-100 for 20 min at
room temperature. this was followed by another
20 min incubation at room temperature in avidin-
biotin complex solution (histofine kit, nichirei,
tokyo, japan). the antibody-peroxidase complex
was visualized with a mixture of 3,3-diaminobenzi-
dine (0.2 mg/ml) and 3% ho, (0.83 ul/ml) in 0.05
m  xxxd3449xxx -saline solution. immunohistochemis-
try on serial tissue sections showed tumor cells with
both gh and prl stained within golgi areas (fig.
3a and b).

in situ hybridization

gh or prl complementary rna (crna) probe
was transcribed from the gh or prl probe in the
presence of 33p-labeled utp. the slides were ex-
posed to the specific probe overnight in moist cham-
bers at 42°c. after hybridization, the slides were
washed in saline sodium citrate (ssc), and signals
were detected with streptavidin-biotin-alkaline phos-
phatase using nitroblue tetrazolium-bromochloroin-
dolyl phosphate (dako). control experiments were
carried out using sense probes, which have a com-
plementary sequence to the antisense probes (not
shown). most of tumor cells also showed gh and
/or prl mrna by in situ hybridization (fig. 4a and
b).

discussion

our patient was suspected of having a gh-pro-
ducing tumor co-existing with a prl-producing one
because of concomitant elevation of both serum
 xxxg1144xxx  and prl levels. serum gh levels were para-
doxically increased in response to trh, and were not
suppressed by prolonged exposure to glucose, further
suggesting the presence of a gh-producing tumor.
this hypothesis was confirmed by both immuno-
histochemistry and in situ hybridization.

a multihormonal pituitary adenoma is found when

more than two pituitary hormones are elevated. in
1978, tolis et al. reported a case of acromegaly and
hyperprolactinemia due to both gh- and prl-
secreting pituitary adenomas [3]. in approximately
30-40% of patients with gh-producing adenomas,
serum prl levels are elevated, mostly due to two
possible mechanisms: 1) hypothalamic-pituitary dis-
connection, resulting in attenuation of prl inhibi-
tory factor, or 2) either monomorphous or pluri-
morphous tumors capable of producing both gh
and prl [4, 5]. in fact, both gh and prl mrna
were detected in 28 out of 59 gh- and/or prl-
macroprolactionma with gh production 45

producing adenomas by in situ hybridization [6].
even among gh- and prl-coproducing adenomas,
it is quite rare that prl is predominantly produced,
while gh is subclinically secreted, as found in our
case.

the tumor consisted of one cell type that produces
both gh and prl, and it was assumed to have
originated in the common precursor of somatotrophs
and lactotrophs. the occurrence of such precursor

cell adenomas that produce gh and prl has also
been described [7, 8]. acidophilic stem cell adeno-
mas, which are chromophobic or slightly acidophilic
tumors with no periodic-acid-schiff (pas) positivity,
share characteristics with both sparsely-granulated
somatotrophs and lactotrophs, as classified by the
kovacs group [6, 9]. the presence of acidophilic
stem cell adenomas is accompanied by hyperprolac-
tinemia, and serum gh levels are elevated or within
46 kageyama ef al.

the normal range [9]. these facts agree with our
findings in this case. the nature of high prolifera-
tion and invasive tumor growth should be kept in
mind in managing patients with this cell type of ade-
noma. gh- or tsh-secreting adenomas are often
accompanied with multihormonal production of
gh, prl, and tsh. pituitary specific transcription
factor (pit-1) is frequently co-expressed with gh,
prl, and tsh-producing tumors [10], and may
contribute to the functional differentiation toward
these tumor cells from the common precursor. al-
ternatively, it seems possible that the tumor has
transformed morphologically because some fetal
somatotrophs differentiate into mammosomatotro-
phs and then into mammototrophs [11]. this trans-
formation could account for some cases of acrome-
galy without gh elevation but with increased prl
[12].

serum  xxxg1144xxx  levels were elevated in our patient,
although basal gh levels were not. it is probable
that gh secretion during the night was enough to
stimulate increased  xxxg1144xxx  levels, even within the
normal ranges of the basal levels. it is also pos-
sible that  xxxg1144xxx  secretagogues other than gh, such as
hypernutrition and hyperinsulinemia, would enhance
 xxxg1144xxx  production [13].

in our case of a monomorphous adenoma, prl
production was predominant and gh production
subclinical; basal gh level was within the normal
range. only a few cases of acromegaly with normal
gh levels are reported [14, 15]. in such cases,  xxxg1144xxx 
might clinically cause the acromegalic features.
however, our patient did not present with acrome-
galic features, although  xxxg1144xxx  was elevated. both
gh and  xxxg1144xxx  act either independently or synergisti-
cally to induce skeletal and organ growth. in our
patient, therefore, the magnitude or the duration of
elevated serum  xxxg1144xxx  levels may have not been
enough to cause the typical acromegalic features
without apparent gh _ oversecretion. it is also
known that both total and free  xxxg1144xxx  levels do not
correlate with the clinical activity of acromegaly [16].

in summary, we report a rare case of a multihor-
monal pituitary adenoma, with predominant prl
and subclinical gh production. an acidophilic stem
cell adenoma might be responsible for their produc-
tion.  xxxg1144xxx  levels should be followed in prloma,
even within the normal range of basal gh levels,
because mixed prl- and gh-producing tumor
would lie underneath. further endocrinological ex-
aminations such as trh test and ogtt are recom-
mended when elevated  xxxg1144xxx  levels are detected.
