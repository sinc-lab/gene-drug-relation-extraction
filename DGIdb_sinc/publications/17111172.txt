abstract
rationale  xxxd2137xxx  (flx) has been used as a neuroleptic
for nearly 4 decades. in vitro data show comparable affinity
to dopamine d2, d1 and 5-ht2a receptors and recently,
flx showed to be not inferior to risperidone in schizophrenic patients with predominant negative symptomatology,
which was implicated with  xxxd2137xxx ’s interaction with
5-ht2a and/or d1 receptors.
objectives to assess in vivo receptor occupancy (ro) in
patients clinically treated with flx (n=13, 5.7±1.4 mg/day)
in comparison with risperidone (ris, n=11, 3.6±1.3 mg/day)
and haloperidol (hal, n=11, 8.5±5.5 mg/day).
materials and methods each patient underwent two
pet scans with 3-n-[11c]methylspiperone (target: frontal
5-ht2a), [11c]sch23390 (striatal d1) or [11c]raclopride

(striatal d2). ro was calculated as the percentage reduction
of specific binding in comparison with healthy controls.
results d2-ro under flx was between 50% and 70%,
indicating an ed50 of about 0.7 ng/ml serum. 5-ht2a and
d1-ro was 20±10% and 20±5% (mean, sem). under
hal, d1-ro was 14±6% and under ris not significantly
different from zero.
conclusions we were able to demonstrate a moderate 5ht2a and d1 occupancy under clinically relevant doses of
 xxxd2137xxx , albeit lower than expected from in vitro data
and clearly below saturation. therefore, if  xxxd2137xxx ’s
efficacy on negative symptoms is based on its interaction
with 5-ht2a and/or d1 receptors, it should be highly
dependent on serum concentration and thus on dosage and
metabolism. however, these data suggest that mechanisms
other than d1 or 5-ht2a antagonism may contribute to
 xxxd2137xxx ’s efficacy on negative symptoms.

introduction
there is a large body of evidence that the neurotransmitter
dopamine and serotonin (5-ht) play an important role in
schizophrenia and in the action of antipsychotic drugs.
several receptor subtypes for these neurotransmitter seem
to be involved herein. it is generally accepted that for
antipsychotic activity (with respect to positive symptoms),
a blockade of mesolimbic dopaminergic transmission with
 xxxg656xxx  antagonists is an essential prerequisite. this

242

hypothesis is, among numerous other findings, based on the
fact that all currently available antipsychotics are more or
less potent  xxxg656xxx  blockers. positron
emission tomography (pet) and single photon emission
computed tomography (spect) have been used for more
than 15 years to assess the in vivo occupancy of various
receptor systems under neuroleptic treatment. receptor
occupancy is defined as the percentage of binding sites
occupied by medication, assessed by means of percentage
reduction of binding potential of a certain receptor system.
the first and most freqently investigated receptor system
under neuroleptic treatment is the  xxxg656xxx 
(farde et al. 1986), many studies of the  xxxg655xxx  and the
serotonergic system followed. pet and spect are
especially useful to investigate the relation between
occupancy and clinical effects, and can therefore be used
to make dose suggestions (nyberg et al. 1999). several
pet and spect studies have come to the conclusion that for
antipsychotic efficacy a blockade of 65–70% of dopamine
d2 receptors is necessary and sufficient, whereas a blockade
of >80% leads to an increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (eps) (nordstroem et al. 1993; nyberg et al. 1995;
kapur et al. 2000a; but also see gründer et al. 2003). this
“therapeutic window” seems to apply for many different
neuroleptics. however, for some “atypical” compounds, e.g.
clozapine or quetiapine, lower d2-ro values were observed
under clinically effective doses (kapur et al. 2000b;
tauscher et al. 2004).
it was hypothesized that both superior effectiveness and
better tolerability of the prototypical atypical antipsychotic
drug clozapine is at least in part due to its additional
interaction with dopamine d1 and 5-ht2a receptors (farde
and nordstrom 1992; farde et al. 1992; meltzer 1992;
lundberg et al. 1996). consequently, during the past years
various so-called atypical or second generation antipsychotics with a combined action on both dopamine d2 and
5-ht2a receptors were developed for the treatment of
schizophrenia. the first of them was risperidone, which
leads to a 5-ht2a-ro that is even higher than that of
dopamine d2 receptors (nyberg et al. 1993, 1996). similar
findings were also reported for most of the other atypical
antipsychotics (seeman 2002; nyberg et al. 1998). those
data support the hypothesis put forward by meltzer et al.
(1989) that the atypicality of antipsychotic drugs may be
related to the ratio of their affinities for 5-ht2a and
dopamine d2 receptors (5-ht2a/d2 ratio). there is some
evidence that the benefit from  xxxg1113xxx  antagonism
is based on interactions between the serotonergic and the
dopaminergic system (lieberman et al. 1998; ichikawa et
al. 2001) resulting in increased dopaminergic activity. it is
interesting to note that the relevance of mesocortical
dopaminergic activity in schizophrenic patients for cognitive functions could be demonstrated with pet. abi-

psychopharmacology (2007) 190:241–249

dargham et al. (2002) showed that increased prefrontal d1
availability, presumably secondary to deficient dopaminergic function, is a strong predictor of poor performance at
the n-back task, a test of working memory. still, the role of
 xxxg1113xxx  antagonism for neuroleptic treatment
remains controversial and other possible criteria for
“atypicality” were described (kapur and seeman 2001;
gründer et al. 2003).
among the classical neuroleptic drugs there are also
compounds with combined dopamine d2 and 5-ht2a
receptors activities. one of those is the thioxanthene
derivative  xxxd2137xxx , which has now been marketed as a
neuroleptic for nearly 4 decades. the pharmacological
receptor profile of  xxxd2137xxx  is characterized by high
affinity interactions with dopamine d1, d2 and 5-ht2a
receptors in vitro (hyttel et al. 1985; glaser and soyka
1998). corresponding human data were generated only in
very few schizophrenic patients by pet measurements
(farde et al. 1992; nyberg et al. 1996; lundberg et al.
1996). based on recent preclinical and clinical studies, a
partial atypical profile of  xxxd2137xxx  was proposed (glaser
and soyka 1998; kuehn et al. 2000). in line with this
profile are the results of a recent double-blind head to head
trial with risperidone, which showed  xxxd2137xxx  being not
inferior to risperidone in 153 schizophrenic patients with
predominant negative symptomatology (philipp et al. 2002,
philipp et al. 2003). in a recent double-blind study with 28
patients (gattaz et al. 2004), the efficacy of  xxxd2137xxx  was
not significantly different from that of olanzapine, whereas
the side effects profile differed in that patients receiving
 xxxd2137xxx  experienced more eps, but less weight gain.
the goal of the present trial was to assess the
occupancies of dopamine d1, d2 and 5-ht2a receptors
in clinically stable schizophrenic patients treated with
 xxxd2137xxx  and to compare the occupancy profile of
 xxxd2137xxx  with that observed under risperidone and
haloperidol under comparable clinical conditions.

materials and methods
this was a monocenter, randomized, open-label study
conducted with patients routinely treated as inpatients or
outpatients with one of the three antipsychotic drugs under
study. approvals were obtained from the local ethics
committee and from the bundesinstitut für strahlenschutz
(bfs). subjects gave their written informed consent after a
detailed description of the study.
patients and control subjects
eligible for the study were patients with the diagnosis of
schizophrenia or schizoaffective psychosis according to the

icd-10 criteria in stable remission, treated in steady state
(i.e. et least for 14 days) with  xxxd2137xxx  (4–10 mg/day or a
corresponding dose of  xxxd2137xxx   xxxd1821xxx ), haloperidol
(5–10 mg/day) or risperidone (2–6 mg/day) with no history
of substance abuse and no severe somatic disorder (e.g.
stroke, parkinsonism, neurodegenerative disorder). at the
time of the pet scan, the patients had to be free of any
other psychotropic medication, the required drug-free
interval was chosen upon clearance (minimum 3 days,
5 weeks for ssri, short-term treatment with benzodiazepines and anticholinergic drugs allowed).
a total of 35 patients (table 1) were enrolled (“intent
to treat” population: n = 13  xxxd2137xxx , n = 11 haloperidol,
n = 11 risperidone), 32 of which underwent two pet
scans within 2 weeks, randomly assigned to two of the
three tracers [11c]raclopride (rac; for assessment of
striatal d2 occupancy), 3-n-[11c]methylspiperone (nms;
for assessment of frontal 5-ht2a occupancy) and [11c]
sch 23390 (sch; for assessment of striatal d1 occupancy). three patients underwent only one pet scan with
one of the abovementioned tracers. in five patients, the urine
test at the day of the first pet scan revealed additional
psychotropic medication or drugs. patients that completed
both pet scans without a positive drug urine test and
without any other protocol violation formed the “per
protocol” population. in three of these patients, serum drug
concentration was very low ( xxxd2137xxx : two patients with
levels below the detection limit; risperidone: one patient with
0.1 ng/ml), presumably due to non-compliance, and their
pet scans were not included in the statistical analysis.
as drug-free controls, 26 age-matched healthy controls
(hc) were recruited after completing a health screening
questionaire and a urine drug test. each control subject
underwent one pet scan. (rac: 9, nms: 9, sch: 8).

preparation of

11

c-ligands

rac, nms and sch were synthesized by alkylation of s(+)-o-demethyl-raclopride, spiperone and demethylsch23390 using [11c]methyliodide (ehrin et al. 1987;
dannals et al. 1986; halldin et al. 1986). high specific
activity [11c]ch3i was prepared using an automated
module (mei microlab, general electric medical systems,
uppsala, sweden). radiolabeling was performed in a pet
tracer synthesizer for 11c-methylations from nuclear
interface (muenster, germany). after purification and
formulation, the three radiotracers were obtained in
radiochemical yields of 25–50% calculated on produced
[11c]ch3i. the total synthesis times were 50–60 min
from the end of bombardment. the specific activities were
in the range of 30–50 gbq/mumol at the end of synthesis.
the radiochemical purities of the final formulated product
solutions were >95% as determined by radio-hplc.
clinical assessments
at the day of each pet scan, patients had to undergo
clinical ratings of their psychopathology by means of the
positive and negative syndrome scale (panss; kay et al.
1987), eps (simpson-angus scale developed in 1970) and
clinical assessment (clinical global impression, cgi). in all
patients, a urine drug test was performed at the day of the
pet scan.
determination of drug plasma levels
venous blood samples were collected directly before
injection of the radioligand, centrifuged and frozen. the
serum drug concentration in all samples was determined
centrally by mds pharma services, fehraltorf, switzerland, using standard analytical techniques.

in total, 93 pet scans were conducted (67 in patients, cf.
table 1 and 26 in healthy controls). the two pet scans of
each patient were conducted at two visits, which were 2–
14 days apart from each other.
during the pet scan, the patients head was fixed in an
elastic mould with adhesive stripes. three fiducial markers
were attached to the scull to support image realignment.
after intravenous bolus injection of 700 mbq rac
(<13.2 mug), nms (<15.4 mug) or sch (<10.8 mug), the
cerebral radioactivity distribution was measured with a ge
advance pet scanner (ge-medical systems, milwaukee,
usa, axial field view of 15 cm) in two-dimension
acquisition mode, followed by a transmission scan with
500,000 kilo counts.

image reconstruction and roi analysis
we used filtered backprojection (128×128 pixel=30 cm)
with a hanning filter (cutoff 4.6 mm) to reconstruct our
images. for realignment and for a coarse anatomical
normalization before roi analysis, we used spm99 with
the standard spm perfusion template and early summation
images (0–5 min p.i.) of each pet-scan with non-linear
transformations being disabeled. time–activity curves were
derived from standardized three-dimensional regions of
interest (roi) locally established at the pet center
tuebingen for the putamen (2×0.7 ml), the frontal cortex
(2×2.0 ml, ba10) and the cerebellum (2×10 ml), manually
placed on summation images 0–5 min p.i. due to the coarse
spatial pre-normalization, we were able to apply these roi
without modifications to size or shape.
modelling and calculation of receptor occupancy (ro)
for each type of receptor, we assessed the availability of
binding sites with the measure k3 =k4 ¼ f2  bmax =kd , in
the literature also denoted v3” (laruelle et al. 1994) or
binding potential bp2 with k3 and k4 being the transfer rate
constants between the first and the second tissue compartment, f2 the free fraction of the tracer in the first tissue
compartment, bmax the density of available (i.e. not
occupied) binding sites and kd the equilibrium dissociation
constant of the radiotracer. the bp2 of d2-like receptors
(rac) was calculated with the simplified reference tissue
method (srtm, lammertsma and hume 1996). the bp2 of
5-ht2a receptors was calculated from bp2 =vr−1 with
vr being the distribution volume ratio obtained as slope of
the linearization proposed by logan et al. 1996, assuming a
washout from the reference tissue k2′=0.06 min−1. this
washout constant was estimated with the srtm from interindividually averaged time–activity curves of the control

mean time–activity curves of nms in the frontal cortex (left) and the
cerebellum (middle). the logan plot (right) shows straight lines for all
groups, data from the haloperidol group is not shown (no 5-ht2a
occupancy). nms is known to bind irreversibly to other receptors
(especially d2) and the linearity of the logan plot therefore assures

psychopharmacology (2007) 190:241–249

subjects (cf. fig. 1). logan’s linearization was also applied
to the sch data, here we used an estimated k2′=0.14 min−1.
the corresponding linearizations of inter-individually averaged data from nms are shown in fig. 1 to demonstrate
approximately mono-exponential behavior during the chosen regression interval.
the ro was assessed by means of the percentage
reduction of specific binding in the striatum (rac, sch)
and the frontal cortex (nms). since no individual baseline
pet (i.e. without neuroleptic treatment) was available, the
mean bp2 (age corrected) of the control group was used
instead (ro = 100%− bp2/bpmean), thus values of ro
below 0% are possible due to baseline variability. for age
correction, a mono-exponential function was fitted to bp2
in healthy controls in a least square sense. since our control
group was age-matched, this age correction had only a
small effect on the calculated mean occupancy, however, it
b2" ,
allowed for reducing the baseline variance (expressed as s
see eq. (2) below) and thus to obtain smaller confidence
intervals.
saturation analysis, statistics
the synaptic concentration of the neuroleptic drug was
assumed to be proportional to the serum concentration,
which allows determining the plasma concentration equivalent to 50% occupancy (ed50) from a non-linear fit of the
saturation curve:
ro ¼ romax  cserum =ðcserum þ ed50 þ

ð1þ

with an assumed romax =100%.
with the given sample sizes, this equation allows to
reliably estimate ed50 only for higher values of ro, as of
d2 receptors. therefore, the occupancy of striatal d1 and
frontal 5-ht2a receptors was not compared with serum
drug concentration, instead a mean level of occupancy was

that d2 density in the frontal cortex is small enough to allow for
reliable quantification of 5-ht2a binding. the slopes are 1.69
(hc=healthy controls), 1.56 (flx= xxxd2137xxx , n = 5) and 1.08
(ris=risperidone, n=6), which corresponds to a reduction of specific
binding by 19% in  xxxd2137xxx  patients

psychopharmacology (2007) 190:241–249

statistically assessed after excluding a few patients, which
had very low level of serum drug concentration, presumably due to non-compliance. the total standard error of the
estimated mean occupancy s ro, which includes the
uncertainty from baseline variability, was calculated from:

the 95% confidence intervals were plotted as diamonds
ranging from −2sigma to +2sigma. for groups with patients having a
positive drug urine test, we calculated ro twice: once
including and once excluding these patients.
for validation, we also calculated the mean receptor
occupancy of frontal 5-ht2a and striatal d1 receptors of
each group from inter-individually averaged time–activity
curves as described previously (reimold et al. 2004).
the inference statistical analysis was conducted as an
exploratory evaluation because no reasonable sample size
calculation could be made beforehand. the analysis was
based on a balanced 3×3 split-plot-factorial design (three
receptors and three treatments) with block confounding, i.e.
subjects were only exposed to two out of three possible
treatments. the analysis of the all psychopathological
rating scales was based on descriptive statistics using
measures of central tendency and spread.

results
the clinical data of all patients are given in table 2. the
patient groups were widely comparable, however, the
duration of neuroleptic treatment was shorter in the risperidone group (mean: 6.4 years) than in the  xxxd2137xxx 
(10.3 years) and the haloperidol groups (11.2 years). the
mean daily dosages of 5.7 mg  xxxd2137xxx , 8.51 mg
haloperidol and 3.59 mg risperidone corresponded to those
usually administered in long-term treatment. two patients
in the  xxxd2137xxx  group and one patient in the risperidone
group had a very low or zero drug serum concentration,
presumably due to non-compliance, therefore these patients
were not used to calculate the mean 5-ht2a and d1
receptor occupancy. psychopathology and eps ratings at
study entry by means of the panss subscales and the
simpson-angus scale, respectively, revealed only marginal
if any differences in the corresponding mean scores
(table 2). changes between visit 1 and visit 2 were
negligible. according to the cgi scale, 70–80% of patients
in each group were mildly to moderately ill at visit 1. only

one (risperidone), two ( xxxd2137xxx ) and three (haloperidol)
patients were judged as markedly ill.
time–activity curves of nms in the frontal cortex and
the reference region are plotted in fig. 1. patients with
 xxxd2137xxx  treatment exhibited slightly faster washout than
the control subjects, the fastest washout was found in
patients receiving risperidone treatment. time–activity
curves in the reference tissue showed only negligible group
differences (mean time–activity curves being visually
identical). the corresponding logan linearization is shown
in fig. 1 and demonstrates mono-exponential pharmacokinetic behaviour during the chosen regression interval.
 xxxg656xxx  occupancy after  xxxd2137xxx  treatment was
below 70% in all patients (fig. 2), corresponding to an
ed50 of 0.68 ng/ml (serum concentration). the calculated
ed50 of risperidone and haloperidol were 2.3 ng/ml and
1.0 ng/ml, respectively. it is interesting to note that the
patient with by far the highest risperidone serum concentration (57 ng/ml) presented a considerably lower ro
(65%) than predicted from the saturation curve (>95%).
figure 3 shows the individual ro of all patients. patients
treated with  xxxd2137xxx  displayed the highest occupancy of
d1 receptors (19.9%). with the estimated standard error of
5.4% (including baseline uncertainty), this means that the

and also significantly different from zero. in the risperidone
group, we observed no significant d1 occupancy.
mean  xxxg1113xxx  occupancy under  xxxd2137xxx 
treatment was 19.5% (23.6% in females, 13.4% in the two
male subjects; including both subjects with a positive drug
urine test: 22.9%) with a standard error of 10.0%, which
corresponds to a mean ro>3%  xxxd2216xxx =0.05 (unilateral).
patients of the risperidone group had a much higher ro
(87.9±4.3%, including the subject with a positive drug
urine test: 88.4%), whereas 5-ht2a-ro under haloperidol
was not significantly different from zero (3.8±13.2%). it is
interesting to note that the variance of frontal nms binding
was much higher in the haloperidol group (sd 33.3%) than
in the controls (11.4%), which might be explained with a
higher baseline variability in this group.
the three patients that had been excluded due to likely
non-compliance displayed occupancy values close to or

even below zero in line with their negligible serum
concentrations, except one patient from the  xxxd2137xxx 
group with 5-ht2a-ro of 24%.

discussion
to our knowledge, this is the first study that reports about
the in vivo binding profile of  xxxd2137xxx  in a larger number
of subjects. as expected from in vitro data, schizophrenic
patients clinically treated with  xxxd2137xxx  exhibited reduced
d1 and  xxxg1113xxx  availability. the corresponding
mean occupancy (20% for both d1 and 5-ht2a) was
significantly lower than that of d2 receptors (63%). while
in a recent clinical trial, it was shown that  xxxd2137xxx  is as
efficacious against negative symptoms as risperidone
(philipp et al. 2002) and  xxxd2773xxx  (gattaz et al. 2004),
our data show that 5-ht2a occupancy under  xxxd2137xxx  is
much lower than that under risperidone. thus, this study
raises the question whether  xxxd2137xxx ’s efficacy against

psychopharmacology (2007) 190:241–249

negative symptoms is based on interactions with other
receptor sites than 5-ht2a or if a therapeutically relevant
interaction with 5-ht2a receptors does not require high
levels of occupation. if the rather low 5-ht2a and/or d1
occupancy was to mediate the therapeutic efficacy against
negative symptoms, one would expect a dependency on
dosage and serum levels, as the saturation curve has a
higher slope for ro=20% than for occupancy levels near
saturation.
while a d1 and 5-ht2a occupancy lower than that of d2
receptors is in agreement with in vitro data and with pet
results reported for a small number of subjects (d1 vs d2:
farde et al. 1992, two subjects; 5-ht2a vs d2: nyberg et al.
1996, one subject), we expected the absolute level of d1
and 5-ht2a occupancy to be higher. in vitro data (glaser
and soyka 1998) suggested ki values for d1 and 5-ht2a
receptors to be in the same order of magnitude as those for
d2-like receptors (d1, 3.8±3.1 nm; 5-ht2a, 4.3±1.2 nm;
d2s, 3.6±1.2 nm; d3, 2.5±0.1 nm). assuming the intraindividual non-specific pharmacokinetic behavior of a
psychotropic drug to be uniform across the investigated
brain regions and transmitter systems, ki-ratios are frequently used equivalent to ed50-ratios to characterize the
pharmacological profile of antipsychotics. with the given
ki-ratios (5-ht2a over d2 =1.2; d1 over d2 =1.06) and a
d2-ed50 of 0.68 ng/ml (cf. fig. 2), eq. (1) yields for our
patients a predicted occupancy of 65% for 5-ht2a and 66%
for d1 receptors, which is more than threefold higher than
measured. this discrepancy is one example that emphasizes
the need of in vivo pet imaging to confirm in vitro data.
but, although the assessment of receptor occupancy with
pet is well-established, it is not without methodological
uncertainties, which may have lead to an underestimation of
d1 and 5-ht2a occupancy in the present study. specific
binding of the radioligand to another type of binding sites
may result in a false low apparent occupancy if these
binding sites are occupied at a lower level. this applies to
different receptor subtypes (e.g. 5-ht2c receptors to which
nms also binds) and to different cellular locations of the
same type of receptor. the latter was discussed to be the
reason why nms and sch are apparently not being
displaced by the endogenous ligand or exhibit even
paradoxical behaviour (for review, see laruelle 2000). in
general, “specific” binding that is not blocked by medication leads to an underestimation of receptor occupancy.
usually it is corrected for by defining a maximum
“occupancy” romax below 100% (eq. (1). using mdl
100907, a highly selective 5-ht2a antagonist, andree et al.
(1998) report about a maximum reduction of specific
binding of nms by 77%, so one might want to correct
the observed ro by a factor of 100/77 to obtain the “true”
5-ht2a occupancy under  xxxd2137xxx  (26% instead of 20%).
little was published that would allow to draw reliable

247

conclusions about the maximum reduction of specific
binding of sch achievable in vivo with a selective d1
antagonist. to our knowledge, the maximum reduction
observed in patients was in the range of 50–60% (e.g.
apparent occupancy under clozapine=55±15%, tauscher et
al. 2004), therefore the “true” d1 occupancy under
 xxxd2137xxx  may well be above the observed 20%. another
possible source of error comes from estimating the
individual baseline binding potential from healthy controls,
e.g. a hypothetical compensatory upregulation, due to either
diagnosis or treatment (huang et al. 1997; schröder et al.
1998), would lead to an underestimation of occupancy. this
is usually ignored because several spect/pet studies
failed to detect significant baseline differences, in spite of
altered dopaminergic transmission (abi-dargham et al.
1998). no baseline differences were found with nms and
sch either (okubo et al. 2000; karlsson et al. 2002),
however, one has to keep in mind that such a baseline shift
may induce a rather small error for high levels of
occcupancy, but not for lower levels (at 80% true
occupancy, a hypothetical upregulation by 25% would
result in an apparent occupancy of 75%; at 40% true
occupancy, the same baseline shift would result in 25%
apparent occupancy). furthermore, the fact that no significant baseline differences were observed after a certain
drug-free interval does not generally exclude an altered
baseline status under neuroleptic treatment, especially since
different neuroleptics may interact differently with the
receptor (weiner et al. 2001; gründer et al. 2003). the
pet ligands sch and nms were used in the literature with
reference tissue methods without experimental validation
against full kinetic modelling (including arterial plasma
samples, metabolite correction and plasma protein binding),
however, we are confident that the chosen methods of
quantification do not introduce further relevant uncertainties to the calculated occupancy values. the chosen
beginning of the regression interval to obtain the slope of
the logan plot had only negligible impact on the calculated
binding potential (data not shown). a noise-dependent bias,
a particular drawback from logan’s method, and the bias
that might result from a variability of non-specific binding
in the reference region was ruled out by demonstrating that
between-subject averaging (reimold et al. 2004) had only
negligible impact on the calculated mean binding potential
(difference <2% in all groups, cf. fig. 1).
our data from patients under treatment with risperidone
are in good agreement with other pet studies, which also
showed a 5-ht2a occupancy higher than that of d2
receptors (nyberg et al. 1999; kapur et al. 1999). it is
interesting to note that we have not observed a significant
occupancy of d1 receptors under risperidone, which is in
agreement with in vitro data, but differs from tauscher et
al. (2004) who previously reported a 25% reduction of

248

specific binding of sch under 4.3 mg risperidone per day
(which is only little more than the 3.6 mg per day in our
patients).
in the haloperidol group, d2 occupancy was closely
related to the serum concentration. in two patients, the
occcupancy was higher than the threshold suggested to be
critical for eps. the observed d1 occupancy (14%,
significantly different from zero) is in agreement with in
vitro data, as was the negligible 5-ht2a occupancy. to our
knowledge, this is the first study that reports about the d1
occupancy under haloperidol in a larger number of subjects.
the focus of this study was to characterize the receptor
profile of  xxxd2137xxx  in a typical clinical setting that was
comparable to that for the two reference neuroleptics. a
limitation of such a design is that estimation of the ed50
may be slightly biased because the dosage of the neuroleptic is not randomized.

conclusion
with respect to d2 occupancy, our data indicate an ed50 of
 xxxd2137xxx  of about 0.7 ng/ml serum. the occupancy
profile of  xxxd2137xxx  with respect to 5-ht2a and dopamine
d1 receptors differs from both risperidone and haloperidol.
in schizophrenic patients clinically treated with stable doses
of  xxxd2137xxx , the average specific binding of nms and
sch to frontal 5-ht2a and striatal d1 receptors was
reduced by 20% corresponding to a moderate d1 and 5ht2a occupancy below the level of d2 occupancy and
clearly below saturation.  xxxd2137xxx ’s affinity to dopamine
d1 receptors was not high enough to allow for a clear
delineation from haloperidol with respect to d1 blockade,
but among the investigated compounds, the highest
dopamine d1 occupancy was indeed observed under
 xxxd2137xxx . in summary, we were able to demonstrate a
moderate 5-ht2a and d1 occupancy under clinical treatment with  xxxd2137xxx . however, 5-ht2a occupancy under
 xxxd2137xxx  lies clearly below that of atypical compounds,
suggesting that other mechanisms than d1 and 5-ht2a
antagonism might contribute to  xxxd2137xxx ’s efficacy on
negative symptoms. we assume the serotonergic effects of
 xxxd2137xxx  and effects from d1 blockade to highly depend
on serum level and thus on dosage and metabolism.
