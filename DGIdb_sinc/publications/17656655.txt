abstract
(⫺)-(1r,2r)-3-(3-dimethylamino-1-ethyl-2-methyl-propyl)-phenol hydrochloride ( xxxd3289xxx  hcl) is a novel ␮-opioid receptor
(mor) agonist (ki ⫽ 0.1 ␮m; relative efficacy compared with
morphine 88% in a [35s]guanosine 5⬘-3-o-(thio)triphosphate
binding assay) and ne reuptake inhibitor (ki ⫽ 0.5 ␮m for
synaptosomal reuptake inhibition). in vivo intracerebral microdialysis showed that  xxxd3289xxx , in contrast to morphine, produces large increases in extracellular levels of ne (⫹450% at
10 mg/kg i.p.).  xxxd3289xxx  exhibited analgesic effects in a wide
range of animal models of acute and chronic pain [hot plate,
tail-flick, writhing, randall-selitto, mustard oil colitis, chronic
constriction injury (cci), and spinal nerve ligation (snl)], with
ed50 values ranging from 8.2 to 13 mg/kg after i.p. administration in rats. despite a 50-fold lower binding affinity to mor, the

activation of opioid receptors, particularly the ␮-opioid
receptor (mor), is one of the main options for the treatment
of moderate-to-severe pain. mor agonists are very effective
against acute pain; however, they may be less effective
against chronic pain of neuropathic or inflammatory origin,
or they may have an unsatisfactory therapeutic window (portenoy, 1996; kalso et al., 2004). since the isolation of morphine 200 years ago, a large number of morphine derivatives
and other mor agonists have been synthesized (maul et al.,

analgesic potency of  xxxd3289xxx  was only two to three times
lower than that of morphine, suggesting that the dual mode of
action of  xxxd3289xxx  may result in an opiate-sparing effect. a
role of ne in the analgesic efficacy of  xxxd3289xxx  was directly
demonstrated in the snl model, where the analgesic effect of
 xxxd3289xxx  was strongly reduced by the ␣2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine but only moderately attenuated by the mor
antagonist naloxone, whereas the opposite was seen for morphine. tolerance development to the analgesic effect of  xxxd3289xxx  in the cci model was twice as slow as that of morphine.
it is suggested that the broad analgesic profile of  xxxd3289xxx 
and its relative resistance to tolerance development may be
due to a dual mode of action consisting of both mor activation
and ne reuptake inhibition.

2002; friderichs and buschmann, 2002). one goal of this
research was to separate the analgesic effect of mor activation from side effects, such as nausea and emesis, constipation, respiratory depression, addiction, and dependence.
however, cloning of the opioid receptors and the investigation of mor knockout mice (matthes et al., 1996) strongly
suggest that both the analgesic activity and side effects of
morphine-like analgesics are mediated by the same receptor
(sub)type. thus, a full dissociation of analgesia from side
effects seems to be impossible within the class of selective
mor agonists.
combining mor agonism with monoamine reuptake inhibition is an approach to improve the therapeutic range of

the chemistry program that was engaged yielded compounds with this desired novel dual activity. the present
article presents the preclinical profile of one of these nonracemic compounds, (⫺)-(1r,2r)-3-(3-dimethylamino-1-ethyl2-methyl-propyl)-phenol hydrochloride ( xxxd3289xxx  hcl)
(fig. 1), with respect to its in vitro characteristics and its
analgesic, antihyperalgesic, and antiallodynic properties in
rat and mouse models of acute and chronic pain.

materials and methods
animals
material for the in vitro studies was obtained from male spraguedawley specific pathogen-free and wistar specific pathogen-free rats
(200 g) and male pirbright-white guinea pigs (200 –250 g) (charles
river, sulzfeld, germany). in vivo studies were conducted with male
nmri mice (20 –35 g) and sprague-dawley rats (130 –180 g)
(charles river; iffa credo, brussels, belgium; and janvier, le genest st. isle, france) (pain models) and with male wistar rats (280 –
350 g) (harlan, horst, the netherlands) (microdialysis). animals
were housed under standard conditions (room temperature 20 –24°c,
12-h light/dark cycle, relative air humidity 45–70%, 15 air changes/h,
air movement ⬍0.2 m/s) with food and water available ad libitum,
with the exception of the time of the experiment. all animals were
used only once in all pain models, with the exception of the neuropathy models, in which they were tested repeatedly with a washout
period of at least 1 week between tests. there were at least 5 days
between delivery of the animals and the test day or surgery. animal
testing was performed in accordance with the recommendations and
policies of the international association for the study of pain (zimmermann, 1983) and the german animal welfare law. all study
protocols were approved by the local government committee for animal research, which is also an ethics committee (in vitro and in vivo
pain studies) and the animal care committee of the faculty of mathematics and natural science of the university of groningen (microdialysis).

in vitro studies
receptor binding. incubations with rat membrane suspensions
from brain without cerebellum for mor; brain without pons, medulla oblongata, and cerebellum for ␦-opioid receptor (dor); and
brain without pons, medulla oblongata, cerebellum, and cortex for
␬-opioid receptor (kor) were carried out to equilibrium. blanks to
quantify nonspecific binding were obtained by saturating the binding
sites with naloxone (10⫺5 m for mor, 10⫺3 m for dor, and 10⫺4 m
for kor). all incubations were run in triplicate and terminated by
rapid filtration under mild vacuum (brandel cell harvester type
m-24 r; brandel inc., gaithersburg, md) and 2 washes of 5-ml buffer
using fp-100 whatman gf/b filter mats (whatman schleicher and
schuell, keene, nh). the radioactivity of the samples was counted
after a stabilization and extraction period of at least 15 h by use of
the scintillation fluid ready protein (beckman coulter, krefeld,
germany). for further details regarding dor and kor binding
studies, see frink et al. (1996).
the human mor binding assay was run in microtiter plates
(costar 3632; corning life sciences, acton, ma) with wheat germ
agglutinin-coated scintillation proximity assay beads (ge health-

opioids. the different, complementary mechanisms of action
may additively or even synergistically enhance the analgesic
efficacy and/or attenuate the side effects of mor agonists by
reducing the requirement for mor activation. the facilitation of monoaminergic transmission in descending pain inhibitory pathways in the spinal cord seems to be an important mechanism because compounds that block the reuptake
of norepinephrine (ne) and/or serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-ht]) are efficacious in the treatment of chronic pain
conditions (carter and sullivan, 2002; tzschentke, 2002) and
can enhance the analgesic effect of morphine (ossipov et al.,
1982). this is of particular relevance because neuropathic
pain is generally considered to be relatively unresponsive to
opiates (mao et al., 2000) and/or difficult to treat effectively
because of mor-related side effects (martin and eisenach,
2001).
attempts to circumvent this problem initially led to the
development of tramadol. tramadol is an atypical, racemic
opioid that combines weak mor activation with inhibition of
5-ht and ne reuptake (raffa et al., 1992). this combination
of complementary mechanisms of action results in potent
analgesic activity. however, the underlying molecular basis
of this effect is complex. tramadol is metabolized to an active
o-desmethyl-metabolite (lintz et al.,1981). both enantiomers and the o-desmethyl-metabolite are involved in the
analgesic activity (raffa et al., 1993), because ne reuptake
inhibition resides mainly in the (⫺)-enantiomer and 5-ht
reuptake inhibition resides in the (⫹)-enantiomer of the parent compound, whereas mor agonistic activity resides in the
(⫹)-enantiomer of o-desmethyl-tramadol and, to a lesser degree, in (⫹)-tramadol itself (frink et al., 1996). thus, the
relative contribution of the different mechanisms of action to
the overall analgesic effect changes over time. as the parent
molecule is metabolized, the contribution of 5-ht and ne
reuptake inhibition is reduced, whereas the contribution of
mor agonism increases, resulting in a complex time- and
metabolism-dependent pattern of pharmacological activities.
because tramadol is mainly metabolized via cytochrome
p450 2d6 (cyp2d6), which is polymorphic in humans, approximately 5 to 15% of the white population are “poor metabolizers” of tramadol and do not experience satisfactory
analgesia with standard doses (poulsen et al., 1996). furthermore, preclinical and clinical evidence, with selective
5-ht reuptake inhibitors, selective ne reuptake inhibitors,
and mixed 5-ht/ne reuptake inhibitors, indicates that analgesia is more readily obtained by ne reuptake inhibition
than by 5-ht reuptake inhibition (max et al., 1992; briley,
2004). finally, a compound without serotonergic activity
would not bear the risk of producing or contributing to a
serotonin syndrome (boyer and shannon, 2005).
given this background, a molecule combining mor affinity
with ne reuptake inhibition in one chemical entity would be
a major improvement of the combined mechanism of action
approach because the full availability of mor activity would
no longer be dependent on metabolic activation, overall drug
exposure would be reduced, and pharmacological activity
would be limited to the two most relevant mechanisms of
action. moreover, because these two mechanisms would reside in a nonracemic molecule that does not form active
metabolites, the relative contribution of the different mechanisms would not change over the course of metabolic transformation.

 xxxd3289xxx : analgesic opiate/ne reuptake inhibitor

costar 3632; corning life sciences). in this case, the volume was
scaled down to 250 ␮l, and incubation was at room temperature.
these conditions (without 5% co2 in o2) are suitable for highthroughput screening campaigns. the incubation period for [3h]ne
and [3h]5-ht uptake lasted 7.5 and 5 min, respectively. blanks to
quantify the nonspecific uptake were run in the presence of nisoxetine (10 ␮m) for [3h]ne and fluoxetine (100 ␮m) for [3h]5-ht
uptake. thereafter, the 96 samples were filtered through a unifilter
gf/b microtiter plate and washed with 200 ml of incubation buffer
by use of a brandel cell harvester mpxri-96t. the unifilter gf/b
plate was dried at 55°c for 1 h. afterward, a back seal (perkinelmer
life and analytical sciences) was fixed on the plate, and 35 ␮l of
scintillation fluid per well (ultima gold; perkinelmer life and analytical sciences) was added. after fixation of a top seal
(perkinelmer life and analytical sciences), the radioactivity was
determined (after an equilibration period of approximately 5 h) in a
1450 microbeta trilux liquid scintillation counter.
agonist-stimulated [35s]gtp␥s binding. the [35s]guanosine
5⬘-3-o-(thio)triphosphate (gtp␥s) assay was carried out as a homogeneous scintillation proximity assay as described by gillen et al.
(2000), with the following modifications. it was run in microtiter
plates (costar 3632; corning life sciences), in which each well
contained 1.5 mg of wheat germ agglutinin-coated scintillation proximity assay beads (ge healthcare) in a final volume of 200 ␮l. to test
the agonistic activity of test compounds on human recombinant
mor-expressing cell membranes from chinese hamster ovary-k1
cells (perkinelmer life and analytical sciences), 10 ␮g of membrane
proteins per assay were incubated with 0.1 nm [35s]gtp␥s (ge
healthcare) and different concentration of agonists in buffer containing 20 mm hepes, ph 7.4, 100 mm nacl, 10 mm mgcl2, 1 mm
edta, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.28 mm nan3, and 1 ␮m gdp for 120
min at 25°c. the microtiter plates were thereafter centrifuged for 10
min at 2100 rpm in a gs6 microtiter plate centrifuge (beckman
coulter) to sediment the beads. the bound radioactivity was determined after a delay of 15 min by means of a 1450 microbeta trilux
liquid scintillation counter. the enhancement of [35s]gtp␥s binding
above the basal activity was used to determine the potency (ec50)
and the relative efficacy (percentage of maximal efficacy) of test
compounds versus the reference compound morphine, which was set
at 100%.

in vivo studies
in vivo intracerebral microdialysis. these experiments were
performed at brains-on-line (groningen, the netherlands). surgery
and microdialysis. rats were anesthetized using 2.5% isoflurane
(400 ml/min n2o; 600 ml/min o2). lidocaine (10% m/v) was used for
local anesthesia. the animals were fixed in a stereotaxic frame
(david kopf instruments, tujunga, ca), and home-made i-shaped
probes were inserted into the ventral hippocampus (dialyzable
length, 4 mm). microdialysis probes were inserted according to paxinos and watson (1982) and secured with dental cement and screws.
coordinates of implantation were: posterior ⫺5.3 mm, lateral ⫹4.8
mm, and ventral ⫺8.0 mm.
experiments were performed 24 to 48 h after surgery. on the day
of the experiment, animals were connected with flexible polyetheretherketone tubing to a microperfusion pump (harvard apparatus
inc., holliston, ma) and perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid
containing 147 mm nacl, 3.0 mm kcl, 1.2 mm cacl2, and 1.2 mm
mgcl2 at a flow rate of 1.5 ␮l/min. microdialysis samples (15-min
fractions) were collected in mini-vials containing 7.5 ␮l of 0.02 m
acetic acid, mixed, and placed in a chilled automatic injection apparatus (gilson 231 autoinjector; gilson, villiers le bel, france).
upon termination of the animals, brains were removed and fixed
in 4% m/v solution of paraformaldehyde. the position of the probe
was verified according to paxinos and watson (1982) by making
coronal sections of the brain.

care, chalfont st. giles, buckinghamshire, uk). a cell membrane
preparation of chinese hamster ovary-k1 cells transfected with the
human mor (rb-hom) was purchased from perkinelmer life and
analytical sciences (beltsville, md). [3h]naloxone (perkinelmer
life and analytical sciences, brussels, belgium) was used as a
ligand for the mor binding studies. as assay buffer for the binding
studies, 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4, supplemented with 0.05% sodium
azide was used. the final assay volume of 250 ␮l per well included 1
nm [3h]naloxone as a ligand and either test compound in dilution
series or 25 ␮m unlabeled naloxone for determination of unspecific
binding. the test compounds were diluted with 25%  xxxd1896xxx  in h2o to yield a final 0.5%  xxxd1896xxx  concentration,
which served as a respective vehicle control. the assays were started
by the addition of the beads (1-mg beads per well), which had been
preloaded for 15 min at room temperature with human mor membranes (23.4 ␮g/250 ␮l of final assay volume per well). after short
mixing, the assays were run for 90 min at room temperature. the
microtiter plates were then centrifuged for 20 min at 500 rpm, and
the signal rate was measured by means of a 1450 microbeta trilux
liquid scintillation counter (perkinelmer life and analytical sciences–wallac oy, turku, finland). half-maximal inhibitory concentration (ic50) values reflecting 50% displacement of [3h]naloxone-specific receptor binding were calculated by nonlinear regression
analysis. individual experiments were run in duplicate and were
repeated three times in independent experiments.
transporter binding. human recombinant ne and 5-ht transporter membranes were obtained from perkinelmer life and analytical sciences. the assays were performed in 96-well microtiter
plates (pp; costar 3632; corning life sciences), essentially according to the product information given by the manufacturer (total
assay volume: 250 ␮l). after incubation, the microtiter plate was
filtered through a unifilter gf/b microtiter plate (perkinelmer life
and analytical sciences) and washed with ice-cold 50 mm tris, 0.9%
nacl, ph 7.4, by use of a brandel cell harvester mpxri-96t. the
unifilter gf/b plate was dried at 55°c for 1 h. afterward, a back seal
(perkinelmer life and analytical sciences) was fixed on the plate,
and 35 ␮l of scintillation fluid per well (ultima gold; perkinelmer
life and analytical sciences) was added. after fixation of a top seal
(perkinelmer life and analytical sciences), the radioactivity was
determined (after an equilibration period of approximately 5 h) in a
1450 microbeta trilux liquid scintillation counter.
synaptosomal ne and 5-ht uptake inhibition. methods
were according to frink et al. (1996). rats were killed by decapitation. the tissue (hypothalamus for ne uptake, medulla oblongata
and pons for 5-ht uptake) was homogenized in ice-cold 0.32 m
sucrose (100 mg of tissue/1 ml) and centrifuged at 4°c for 10 min at
1000g. subsequent centrifugation of the supernatant at 17,000g for
55 min yielded a pellet (p2), which was resuspended in 0.32 m
glucose (⬃0.5 ml/100 mg original weight). incubations were run in
triplicate. the synaptosomal suspension (50 ␮l) containing approximately 200 ␮g of protein for ne and 5-ht uptake transporters was
added to 850 ␮l of incubation medium containing the drug to be
tested and preincubated for 5 min at 37°c under an atmosphere of
5% co2 in o2. accumulation was started by the addition of the
radioactive substrate to yield a concentration of 0.1 ␮m in a final
volume of 1 ml. uptake was stopped after 30 s in the case of [3h]5-ht
and 60 s in the case of [3h]ne accumulation by the addition of 8 ml
of ice-cold incubation medium, immediately followed by filtration
through fp-100 whatman gf/b filter mats using a brandel cell
harvester. filters were washed with 5 ml of incubation medium and
then extracted with ready protein (beckman coulter) for at least
15 h and counted for radioactivity. the incubation medium contained
119 mm nacl, 3.9 mm kcl, 0.51 mm cacl2, 0.65 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 15.6
mm na2hpo4, 3.4 mm nah2po4, 10 mm glucose, 0.57 mm ascorbic
acid, and 0.0156 mm iproniazid. the ph was adjusted to 7.4 by the
addition of naoh (23°c). values were corrected for accumulation of
tritium at 0°c.
the uptake was also measured in 96-well microtiter plates (pp;

behavioral studies
experimental procedures. animals were assigned randomly to
treatment groups. different doses and vehicle were tested in a randomized fashion. although the operators performing the behavioral
tests were not formally “blinded” with respect to the treatment, they
were not aware of the study hypothesis or the nature of differences
between drugs. models were selected to cover a range of different
types and etiologies of pain.
hot plate. the hot plate test was adapted from eddy and leimbach (1953). the device consisted of an electrically heated surface
and an open plexiglas tube (17 cm high ⫻ 22 cm diameter) to confine
the animals to the heated surface. the temperature was kept at
48.0 ⫾ 0.5°c. mice were placed on the hot plate, and the time until
either licking of the hind paw or jumping occurred was recorded with
a stopwatch. animals were tested before and 30 min after drug
administration. the predrug latencies were between 17 and 45 s. the
maximal possible effect (mpe) was defined as the lack of a nociceptive response during the exposure to the heat stimulus. the percentage of mpe was calculated according to the formula: [(t1 ⫺ t0)/(t2 ⫺
t0)] ⫻ 100, where t0 and t1 were the latencies obtained before and
after drug injection and t2 was the cut-off time (120 s).
tail-flick. the tail-flick test was carried out in rats using a
modification of the method described by d’amour and smith (1941).
the tail-flick latency, defined by the time (in seconds) to withdraw
the tail from a radiant heat source (bulb, 8 v/50 w), was measured
using a semiautomated device (bmg labtech gmbh, offenburg,
germany). the heat source was adjusted to produce a baseline tailflick latency of 3 to 5 s. a cut-off time of 12 s was set to avoid tissue
damage. the increase in tail-flick latency was defined as antinociception and calculated as % mpe according to the formula: [(t1 ⫺
t0)/(t2 ⫺ t0)] ⫻ 100, where t0 and t1 were the latencies obtained
before and after drug application and t2 was the cut-off time. animals were tested before and 20, 40, and 60 min after administration
of the test compounds.
randall-selitto. the yeast model of inflammatory pain was performed according to randall and selitto (1957). for induction of
inflammation, 0.1 ml of 20% yeast was injected s.c. into the plantar
surface of the right hind paw of the rat. the mechanical nociceptive
threshold was measured using an algesiometer (ugo basile, comerio, italy). the device generated a mechanical force with a linear
increase over time. the force was applied to the dorsal surface of the
inflamed rat hind paw via a cone-shaped stylus with a rounded tip (2
mm2). the nociceptive threshold was defined as the force (g) at which
the rat vocalized (cut-off force 450g). test compounds were given 4 h

after yeast injection. the mechanical nociceptive threshold was measured before and at 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after drug or vehicle
administration. the drug effects were expressed as % mpe calculated as follows: [(nociceptive threshold drug ⫺ nociceptive threshold
control)/(cut-off ⫺ nociceptive threshold control) ⫻ 100].
mustard oil-induced visceral pain. acute colitis was induced
by mustard oil (laird et al., 2001), and animals were monitored in
plexiglas boxes (14.5 ⫻ 14.5 cm; height, 10 cm) on a grid. rectal
administration of mustard oil (50 ␮l, 3.5%) in mice induced spontaneous visceral pain behavior (scored as follows: 1 ⫽ licking of abdominal wall; 2 ⫽ stretching, squashing, mounting, backward-movement, or contraction of the flank muscles; number of reactions
recorded 2–12 min after mustard oil) and referred hypersensitivity.
before rectal administration (baseline) and 20 min thereafter, the
frequency of withdrawal reactions to the application of von frey
filaments to the abdomen was examined. five filaments with stimulus intensities of 1, 4, 8, 16, and 32 mn were applied 10 times each
in ascending order, and the number and intensity of the responses
were recorded. the filament was applied for 1 to 2 s, with an interstimulus interval of 5 to 10 s. consecutive stimulations were performed at different locations of the abdomen. pretest values were
subtracted from values taken 20 min after mustard oil for each
individual animal. besides the response frequency for the different
von frey stimuli (calculated for each animal, with 100% being animals responding to each of the 10 stimulations with the respective
filament), referred allodynia (counting of withdrawal reactions
against 10 stimulations on the abdomen with a 1 mn von frey
filament; 20 min after mustard oil) and referred hyperalgesia (counting and scoring of withdrawal reactions against 10 stimulations on
the abdomen with a 16 mn von frey filament; 20 min after mustard
oil) were measured. scoring of withdrawal reactions for hyperalgesia
was as follows: 1 ⫽ lifting of abdomen, licking, movement; 2 ⫽
extrusion or flinching of hind paws, slight jumping, strong licking;
3 ⫽ strong jumping, vocalization. as control animals without colitis
were unresponsive to the von frey filament of 1 mn, this stimulus
intensity was considered to be adequate for the testing of allodynia.
one group of control animals received rectal administration of mustard oil vehicle; another group received drug vehicle before mustard
oil. drug or drug vehicle was given 5 min before rectal administration. ed50 values were calculated based on the number of spontaneous pain reactions, withdrawal reactions toward von frey stimulation (1–32 mn), and scored withdrawal reactions (16 mn).
spinal nerve ligation. the spinal nerve ligation (snl) model of
neuropathic pain was adapted from kim and chung (1992). under
pentobarbital anesthesia (narcoren, 60 mg/kg i.p.), the left l5 and l6
spinal nerves were exposed by removing a small piece of the paravertebral muscle and a part of the left spinous process of the l5
lumbar vertebra. the l5 and l6 spinal nerves were then carefully
isolated and tightly ligated with silk (nc-silk black, usp 5/0, metric
1; b. braun melsungen ag, melsungen, germany). after checking
hemostasis, the muscle and the adjacent fascia were closed with
sutures, and the skin was closed with metal clips. after surgery,
animals were allowed to recover for 1 week. for the assessment of
mechanical allodynia, which was stable for at least 5 weeks, the rats
were placed on a metal mesh covered with a plastic dome and were
allowed to habituate until exploratory behavior ceased. the threshold for mechanical allodynia was measured with an electronic von
frey anesthesiometer (somedic ab, hörby, sweden). animals were
tested before and 0.5, 1, 3, and 30 h after administration of the test
compounds. withdrawal thresholds of the injured paws were assessed and expressed as % mpe comparing predrug threshold of
ligated animals (i.e., 0% mpe) and control threshold of sham animals (i.e., 100% mpe). drugs or vehicle were tested in weeks 1 to 5
after surgery (one test per week) in a counterbalanced within-group
design.
streptozotozin model (diabetic polyneuropathy). the  xxxd3249xxx  model of neuropathic pain was adapted from courteix et al.
(1993). rats were injected with  xxxd3249xxx  (75 mg/kg i.p.) dis-

reversed-phase column (thermo bds  xxxd3100xxx  150 ⫻ 2.1 mm, c18, 3
␮m; thermo fisher scientific, waltham, ma) followed by an electrochemical detector (antec intro potentiostate; antec, leyden, the
netherlands) working at a potential setting of 500 mv versus ag/
agcl reference. the mobile phase consisted of 4.1 g/l sodium acetate,
150 mg/l sodium octanesulfonic acid, 150 mg/l tetramethylamine,
150 mg/l edta, and 1.8% methanol, ph 4.1. the flow rate of the
mobile phase was 0.35 ml/min and was delivered by a shimadzu

data analysis
in vitro studies. ic50 values were calculated using the computer
software “figure p” (version 6.0c; biosoft, cambridge, uk), and ki
values were obtained using the cheng-prusoff equation. equilibrium
dissociation constant (kd) values were calculated using the computer
software “ligand” (version 4; biosoft).
in vivo studies. microdialysis. four consecutive microdialysis
samples with less than 40% variation were taken as baseline levels
and set at 100%. drug effects were expressed as percentage of the

basal level (mean ⫾ s.e.m.). statistical analysis was performed
using sigmastat for windows (spss inc., chicago, il). effects were
compared versus vehicle using two-way anova with repeated measures across all doses for each compound and transmitter and subsequently, where applicable, for each individual dose, followed by the
dunnet’s post hoc test. the level of statistical significance was set at
p ⬍ 0.05.
pain models. unless indicated otherwise in the preceding sections,
data were analyzed by means of 1- or 2-factor anova with or
without repeated measures, depending on the experimental design.
significance of treatment, time, or treatment ⫻ time interaction
effects was analyzed by means of wilks’ lambda statistics. in the
case of a significant treatment effect, pairwise comparison was performed at the time of maximal effect by fisher least significant
difference test. results were considered statistically significant if
p ⬍ 0.05. ed50 values and 95% confidence intervals were determined
at the time of the peak effect for each drug by semi-logarithmic
regression analysis or according to litchfield and wilcoxon (1949).
ed50 values with nonoverlapping 95% confidence intervals were
considered to be significantly different. note that our definition of
ed50 value differs from the original strict mathematical definition in
that our ed50 values refer to the calculated dose that would yield
50% mpe in the test population, rather than the dose that would
yield a given effect in 50% of the test population. although this
modified definition deviates from the formal mathematical definition, it is commonly used for the analysis of behavioral data.

in opioid receptor binding studies,  xxxd3289xxx  bound to
native rat mor, dor, and kor, with ki values of 0.096,
0.97, and 0.91 ␮m, respectively (table 1). at the human
recombinant mor,  xxxd3289xxx  had a similar ki of 0.16 ␮m
(fig. 2a) as at the native rat mor.  xxxd3289xxx  did not bind
to the human recombinant  xxxg1634xxx  receptor (ki ⬎ 100 ␮m). in
the human mor [35s]gtp␥s binding assay,  xxxd3289xxx

solved in citrate solution, ph 4.6. control animals received citrate
solution. diabetes was confirmed 1 week after injection by measurement of tail vein blood glucose levels with hemoglukotest 20-800r
glucose and a reflectance colorimeter (roche diagnostics, mannheim, germany). animals with a blood glucose level of ⬎17 mm were
considered to be diabetic. tests took place during weeks 3 and 4 after
the induction of diabetes. at that time, the abnormal pain behavior
was at a stable maximum (courteix et al., 1993). mechanical hyperalgesia was assessed using an algesiometer (ugo basile) by measuring withdrawal thresholds to an increasing pressure on the dorsal
surface of the right paw via a cone-shaped pusher with a rounded tip
(2 mm2). the cut-off was set at 250 g, and the behavioral readout was
paw withdrawal, vocalization, or overt struggling. the reaction latencies were measured before and 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after
administration of the test compounds. the value before administration of substance was used as 0% mpe, and 100% mpe represented
full antihyperalgesic efficacy (i.e., cut-off).
antagonism in the writhing model. writhing was induced by
i.p. injection of 0.35 ml of a 0.02% solution of phenylquinone according to the method described by hendershot and forsaith (1959). the
characteristic writhing responses, such as stretching, twisting a hind
leg inward, or contraction of the abdomen, were observed and
counted from 5 to 20 min after phenylquinone administration. during this time, the animals were placed individually in observation
boxes. recording of the writhing reactions (with the help of a pressbutton counter) started 10 min after administration of the test compounds. naloxone (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/kg) was given 10 min
before the respective agonist.
antagonism in the spinal nerve ligation model. the experimental details were identical to those described above. in the antagonism experiments, yohimbine (2.15 mg/kg), naloxone (0.3 mg/
kg), or vehicle was administered 5 min before  xxxd3289xxx  (10 mg/kg),
morphine (6.81 mg/kg), or vehicle. animals were tested before and
0.5, 1, and 3 h after drug administration. drugs or vehicle were
tested in weeks 1 to 4 after surgery.
tolerance development in the chronic constriction injury
model. the chronic constriction injury model of neuropathic pain
was adapted from bennett and xie (1988). under pentobarbital
anesthesia (narcoren, 60 mg/kg i.p.), the right common sciatic nerve
was exposed by blunt dissection at the level of mid-thigh, and four
loose ligatures (softcatchrom usp 4/0, metric2; b. braun melsungen
ag) were placed around the nerve, taking care not to interrupt the
epineural circulation. cold allodynia was tested on a metal plate
cooled by a water bath to a constant temperature of 4°c. one week
after surgery, individual baselines were determined. animals were
randomly assigned to three groups treated daily with vehicle or
equipotent doses of  xxxd3289xxx  (6.81 mg/kg) or morphine (6.81 mg/
kg). cold allodynia was measured (by counting brisk paw withdrawal
reactions) for 30 min after administration of test compounds on days
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, and 23 of the treatment. treatment
of all groups continued until full tolerance (i.e., lack of significant
antiallodynic effect) against  xxxd3289xxx  was reached, i.e., day 23.
ed50 values were determined in a separate group of chronic constriction injury (cci) rats that was tested before and 15, 30, 45 and 60
min after drug administration. % mpe of each time point was calculated according to the formula: [(t0 ⫺ t1)/t0] ⫻ 100, where t0 and
t1 were numbers of paw withdrawal reactions before and after drug
administration, respectively.

in vivo intracerebral microdialysis
 xxxd3289xxx  (4.64 –10 mg/kg i.p.) produced a clear, dosedependent increase in extracellular levels of ne, with a maximal increase of 450% above baseline obtained  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg.
overall, anova indicated a significant effect of  xxxd3289xxx 
on extracellular ne levels [f(2,15) ⫽ 5.44, p ⬍ 0.05].
whereas increases elicited by the lower dose (4.64 mg/kg)
were not significant [f(1,10) ⫽ 3.10, p ⬎ 0.05], 10 mg/kg
significantly increased ne levels [f(1,10) ⫽ 6.03, p ⬍ 0.05].
extracellular levels of 5-ht were also increased significantly
by  xxxd3289xxx , albeit to a lesser extent than ne (up to 130%
above baseline,  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg). overall, anova indicated a
significant effect of  xxxd3289xxx  on extracellular 5-ht levels
[f(2,15) ⫽ 5.42, p ⬍ 0.05]. as for ne, the effects of the lower
dose (4.64 mg/kg) were not significant [f(1,10) ⫽ 2.79, p ⬎
0.05], whereas the higher dose (10 mg/kg) elicited significant
increases in 5-ht levels [f(1,10) ⫽ 8.11, p ⬍ 0.05] (fig. 4).
morphine (1–10 mg/kg i.p.) did not significantly affect extracellular levels of ne and 5-ht across the dose range
tested [anova, f(3,17) ⫽ 1.37, p ⬎ 0.05 for ne; f(3,23) ⫽
1.45, p ⬎ 0.05 for 5-ht]. there was only a tendency toward

decreased ne levels and increased 5-ht levels at the two
lower doses tested (fig. 4).
behavioral tests
ed50 values (with 95% confidence limits) from all pain
models are summarized in table 2. because of an extensive
first-pass metabolism,  xxxd3289xxx  has a low oral absolute
bioavailability of approximately 9% in rats. this is much
lower than the oral absolute bioavailability of  xxxd3289xxx  in
man (approximately 32%, which is comparable to that of
morphine) (tzschentke et al., 2006; unpublished data).
therefore, it was decided to use the i.p. route of administration to circumvent the problem of low oral availability of
 xxxd3289xxx  in rats and potential underestimation of its potency and efficacy (relative to morphine) in humans.
hot plate.  xxxd3289xxx  [f(4,45) ⫽ 8.92, p ⬍ 0.0001] and
morphine [f(4,45) ⫽ 12.35, p ⬍ 0.0001] induced dose-dependent antinociception and reached full efficacy. morphine was
approximately two to three times more potent than  xxxd3289xxx  (ed50 4.7 versus 11.8 mg/kg i.p., respectively) (fig. 5a).

morphine [f(5,54) ⫽ 22.48, p ⬍ 0.0001] induced dose-dependent antinociception and reached full efficacy. morphine was
approximately twice as potent as  xxxd3289xxx  (ed50 5.8 versus

5.6 versus 10.1 mg/kg i.p., respectively) (fig. 6).
mustard oil-induced visceral pain.  xxxd3289xxx

ki values in the range of 0.47–1.19 ␮m), and the rat 5-ht3
receptor (ki ⫽ 1.04 ␮m). in the case of the muscarinic receptors, further characterization revealed that  xxxd3289xxx  behaved like a weak muscarinic antagonist in a human embryonic kidney (hek-293) cell assay. with respect to the 5-ht3
receptor,  xxxd3289xxx  showed a dose-dependent antagonistic
activity in a guinea pig colon bioassay (see tzschentke et al.,

antagonism in the writhing model. in a pilot experiment (to determine equianalgesic doses for subsequent antagonism experiments),  xxxd3289xxx  and morphine induced a

(0.681 mg/kg i.v.) were combined with increasing doses of
naloxone, the antinociceptive effect of morphine was more
potently reduced than that of  xxxd3289xxx  at any given naloxone dose (fig. 9). naloxone antagonized the morphine effect

data are expressed as mean (⫾ s.e.m.) in terms of number of writhing

treatment levels ( xxxd3289xxx , morphine).

trinsic efficacy of  xxxd3289xxx  at the mor was similar to
morphine, and the compound was relatively selective for the
mor because binding to the kor and dor subtypes was
approximately 10-fold less potent and binding to the  xxxg1634xxx 
receptor was more than 1000-fold less potent. there was a
very good match between native rat and human recombinant
mor binding. under our experimental conditions,  xxxd3289xxx  was nearly as potent as venlafaxine with respect to ne
transporter binding and functional ne reuptake inhibition.
a broad receptor binding and enzyme activity screen revealed no evidence for interactions of comparable (i.e., submicromolar) potency with targets other than the mor and
the ne transporter, with the exception of the muscarinic
receptor, for which a weak antagonistic activity was subsequently shown in a functional assay. submicromolar binding
was also found for the sigma2 binding site. however, because

the relevance and function of this receptor is not well characterized and is controversially debated, this finding was
given no further consideration. thus, with respect to targets
generally thought to be relevant for analgesic activity (buschmann et al., 2002),  xxxd3289xxx  can be considered to be
selective for the mor and the ne transporter.
there was an apparent mismatch between functional rat
synaptosomal uptake inhibition and human recombinant
transporter binding.  xxxd3289xxx  had a higher affinity for the
5-ht transporter than for the ne transporter in the binding
assays but displayed a more potent inhibition of the ne
transporter than that of the 5-ht transporter in functional
assays. a similar discrepancy between binding affinity and
reuptake inhibition potency at the ne and 5-ht transporter
has also been reported, e.g., for venlafaxine (béique et al.,
1998; and discussion therein). the outcome of binding assays
can be strongly influenced by the experimental conditions.
furthermore, the mere binding of a ligand to a transporter,
by itself, does not provide any information about the functional significance of the ligand-transporter interaction and
the intrinsic efficacy of the ligand. this information is much
more accurately provided by functional assays, the results of
which, in turn, were in very good agreement with the in vivo
microdialysis data.
in vivo intracerebral microdialysis with probes located in
the ventral hippocampus was performed in awake rats. pilot
studies with the selective ne reuptake inhibitor  xxxd3089xxx 
and the selective 5-ht reuptake inhibitor citalopram confirmed that this brain region is sensitive to both ne and
5-ht reuptake inhibitors (see cremers et al., 2007; unpublished data).  xxxd3289xxx  induced a clear increase in extracellular ne levels in the analgesic dose range but only a moderate increase in extracellular 5-ht levels. morphine, on the
other hand, had a comparable (if somewhat delayed and
nonsignificant) effect on 5-ht, but it did not produce an
increase in extracellular ne levels. thus, consistent with the
in vitro data, the microdialysis data demonstrate that the
norepinephrinergic activity of  xxxd3289xxx  is much more pronounced than its serotonergic activity.
 xxxd3289xxx  is metabolized predominantly by o-glucuronidation (terlinden et al., 2006). the o-glucuronide did not
show any affinity for the mor, the ne transporter, or any of
the other targets studied and was devoid of any activity in
the mouse tail-flick test after i.v. or i.c.v. administration
(data not shown). this clearly differentiates  xxxd3289xxx  from
other opioids, such as codeine or tilidine, and also from tramadol, which all require metabolic activation or morphine,
which is converted to the highly potent morphine-6-glucuronide. because the analgesic activity of  xxxd3289xxx  resides in
the parent molecule, polymorphic cyp2d6 enzymes are not
required for conversion to an active metabolite, thereby reducing the likelihood of large individual variations in the
analgesic response to  xxxd3289xxx .
it is well known that mor agonists and ne reuptake
inhibitors have analgesic effects, although the pain conditions in which these two drug classes are most efficacious
may be different. it appears that, overall, mor agonists are
predominantly effective against acute, moderate-to-severe
pain, whereas ne reuptake inhibitors are particularly effective against chronic pain (casy and parfitt, 1986; carter and
sullivan, 2002). this implies that a compound that combines
both mechanisms of action holds the promise of being effec-

tive against a large spectrum of pain conditions, ranging
from acute to chronic pain. in the present studies,  xxxd3289xxx 
showed antinociceptive, antihyperalgesic, and/or antiallodynic effects in various models of acute and chronic (neuropathic) pain, including the l5 spinal nerve ligation model
(kim and chung, 1992) and  xxxd3249xxx -induced polyneuropathy (courteix et al., 1993); in models of inflammatory
pain, such as the yeast model (randall and selitto, 1957);
and in models of acute nociception, such as hot plate (eddy
and leimbach, 1953) and tail-flick (d’amour and smith,
1941), thus confirming a broad spectrum of analgesic activity
that was expected for a compound with mor agonistic and
ne reuptake-inhibiting properties. although morphine was
also found to be active across the various pain models, it
should be noted that there was a striking mismatch between
the potency difference of morphine and  xxxd3289xxx  with regard to mor binding on the one hand and analgesic effects
on the other hand. the potency difference for mor binding
was approximately 50-fold, whereas the overall potency dif-

ference for analgesia was only approximately 2 to 3-fold in
most pain models after systemic administration. based on
the mor agonistic activity alone,  xxxd3289xxx  would have
been expected to have a much lower analgesic potency, suggesting that another mechanism of action and/or the kinetics
of the compound are likely to contribute to this effect. the in
vitro and microdialysis data indicate that the additional
mechanism contributing to the analgesic effect of  xxxd3289xxx 
is inhibition of ne reuptake. this suggestion was corroborated in in vivo pharmacological antagonism studies. in the
snl model of neuropathic pain, it was shown that the analgesic effect of  xxxd3289xxx  was much more sensitive to the
antagonistic effect of a given dose of yohimbine than that of
an equianalgesic dose of morphine. furthermore, under identical experimental conditions, the analgesic effect of morphine was much more sensitive to the antagonistic effect of
naloxone than that of  xxxd3289xxx . because  xxxd3289xxx  combines mor agonism and ne reuptake inhibition in a single
molecule, isobolographic analysis of the interaction of the two
mechanisms of action is not possible. however, preclinical as
well as clinical evidence indicates that opioid analgesia can
be augmented by monoamine reuptake inhibitors (ossipov et
al., 1982; levine et al., 1986; ventafridda et al., 1990).
tolerance to the analgesic effect of opioids can be readily
observed in animal pain models (for review, see trujillo,
2000) and can also occur in the clinical setting, necessitating
dose increases during prolonged treatment (ballantyne and
mao, 2003). tolerance development to the analgesic effect of
 xxxd3289xxx  in the cci model in rats during repeated administration was much delayed compared with morphine. we
also investigated tolerance development in the rat tail-flick
model. preliminary data indicate that, using equianalgesic
doses of  xxxd3289xxx  and morphine, the shape of the curve
showing the loss of antinociceptive effect of  xxxd3289xxx  was
clearly different from that obtained for morphine. morphine
showed an immediate onset of tolerance development and
complete tolerance within 21 days of treatment.  xxxd3289xxx 
showed a delayed onset of tolerance development. after on-

set, there was a progressive decline of effect until day 18,
followed by a plateau phase of moderate antinociception (30%
mpe) and complete tolerance on day 51. it is noteworthy that
the delayed tolerance development was seen only for the
analgesic effect of  xxxd3289xxx ; tolerance development for the
respiratory depressant effect was not delayed compared with
morphine (see tzschentke et al., 2006). we also have preliminary data showing that the ne reuptake inhibitor desipramine has an analgesic effect in the cci model that does not
show tolerance after more than 3 weeks of daily applications.
this suggests that the prolonged analgesic activity of  xxxd3289xxx  may be related to its norepinephrinergic activity.
notably,  xxxd3289xxx  has also been shown to have a clearly
reduced emetic potential compared with morphine and produce less physical dependence than morphine at equianalgesic doses (tzschentke et al., 2006). both observations may be
related to the reduced mor binding affinity of  xxxd3289xxx 
relative to morphine and, at least in the case of physical
dependence, to the ne reuptake inhibitory properties of the
compound.
in conclusion,  xxxd3289xxx  was characterized as a new analgesic drug with a dual mode of action. it combines moderate mor agonistic activity with ne reuptake inhibition in a
single, nonracemic molecule. no metabolic activation of  xxxd3289xxx  is necessary for analgesia, and it has no active metabolites. because of its dual mechanism of action,  xxxd3289xxx  has efficacy in a broad spectrum of acute and chronic
pain models and possibly an improved tolerability profile.
 xxxd3289xxx  is currently in phase iii of clinical development.
