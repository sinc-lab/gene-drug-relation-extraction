abstract
the importance of stress in modifying human behavior and
lifestyle is no longer a matter of debate. although mild stress
enhances the immune response and prevents infections,
prolonged stress seems to play pathogenic roles in depression and neurodegenerative disorders. the body has
developed an adaptive stress response consisting of cardiovascular, metabolic, and psychological changes, which act in
concert to eliminate stressors. one of the major components
of this response is the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis,
also known as the stress axis. over the last 30 years, many
studies have documented the integrated stress-axis regulation
by neurotransmitters. they have also demonstrated that

gaseous neuromodulators, such as no, co, and h2s, regulate the hypothalamic release of neuropeptides. the specific
effects (stimulatory vs. inhibitory) of these gases on the stress
axis varies, depending on the type of stress (neurogenic or
immuno-inflammatory), its intensity (low or high), and the
species studied (rodents or humans). this review examines
the complex roles of no, co, and h2s in modulation of stressaxis activity, with particular emphasis on the regulatory effects
they exert at the hypothalamic level.

maintaining good health is a major goal of all humans.
unfortunately, despite our efforts to preserve wellness, every
day intrinsic and/or extrinsic forces disturb this complex
dynamic state of equilibrium, also known as homeostasis
(tsigos and chrousos 2002). these forces are called stressors,
and they can have various origins, the most important of
which are infectious diseases and psychosocial events. the
body has developed a ‘general adaptation response’ consisting of cardiovascular, metabolic, and psychological changes
aimed at counteracting the effects of these stressors (pedersen
et al. 2001; tsigos and chrousos 2002). this response is
under the control of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal
(hpa) axis, which is responsible for the release of glucocorticoid hormones from the adrenal gland. the metabolic and
anti-inﬂammatory activities of these steroid hormones are key
components of the adaptive stress response (pedersen et al.
2001; tsigos and chrousos 2002).
over the past 2–3 decades, many studies have addressed
the mechanisms by which the ‘classic’ neurotransmitters
inﬂuence the hpa axis, especially at the central level
(calogero et al. 1988, 1989; grossman et al. 1993; jessop
1999; leonard 2005). compelling evidence has also emerged

on the stress-regulating roles of gaseous neuromodulators,
such as no, co, and h2s, in particular on the effects they
produce at the hypothalamic and/or pituitary levels (mancuso
et al. 1997a; navarra et al. 2000; rivier 2002; wu and wang

or inhibit the stress axis is still a matter of debate: their
effects vary, depending on the type and intensity/duration of
the stress and the animal species being studied. the aim of
this paper is to review the literature on the roles of no, co,
and h2s in modulation of stress-axis activity with particular
emphasis on its central regulation.

the hpa axis or stress axis
the hypothalamus plays key roles in many brain functions,
including the control of the autonomic nervous system and
regulation of body temperature, food intake, and hormone
secretion. located within the diencephalon, it is delimited
anteriorly by the optic chiasm, laterally by the optic tracts
and temporal lobes, and posteriorly by the mammillary
bodies (toni et al. 2004). the hypothalamus is divided into
the pre-optic, supraoptic, tuberal, and mammillary regions,
each containing different groups of cells – or nuclei – with
distinct characteristics and regulatory mechanisms. the preoptic, supraoptic (son), and paraventricular (pvn) nuclei
are particularly important because they are involved in the
release of hypothalamic neuropeptides (toni et al. 2004).
the pituitary, which is regarded as the master endocrine
gland, is located in the sella turcica, a small cavity within the
sphenoid bone. it is divided into two regions: the anterior
pituitary, or adenohypophysis, and the posterior pituitary, or
neurohypohysis (toni et al. 2004).
the hypothalamus and the pituitary are closely related,
both anatomically and functionally. in fact, the stalk of the
pituitary is directly connected to the median eminence, a
small swelling on the lower aspect of the hypothalamus that
is one of the few brain areas not protected by the blood–brain
barrier (toni et al. 2004). a complex system of portal vessels
conveys hypothalamic neuropeptides to both the anterior and
posterior regions of the pituitary. the neurons located in the
pvn and son synthesize  xxxd1752xxx -releasing hormone
(crh) and  xxxd3495xxx  (avp), the neuropeptides
responsible for activation of the stress axis at the hypothalamic level (toni et al. 2004). crh is released into the
median eminence by axons of the parvicellular population of
pvn neurons. from here, the peptide enters the primary
portal plexus of the hypothalamus and is transported through
the long vessels to the anterior pituitary, where it stimulates
the release of  xxxg1801xxx  hormone (acth) by
corticotroph cells. direct communication between some of
these axons and the anterior pituitary has also been
demonstrated (toni et al. 2004). as for avp, axons of
neurons located in the magnocellular portions of the pvn
and son release this neuropeptide into the median
eminence. the short portal vessels of the sinusoidal plexus
then transport the avp to the anterior pituitary, where it
stimulates acth release. other axons transport avp directly
to the posterior pituitary, where it is released into the
systemic circulation (toni et al. 2004).

during non-stressful situations, the release of both crh
and avp is characterized by a pulsatile circadian rhythm,
with higher-amplitude pulses during the morning hours.
under conditions of stress, both the amplitude and synchronization of crh and avp pulses increase, producing
signiﬁcantly higher blood levels of acth (tsigos and
chrousos 2002). pituitary acth then stimulates the adrenal
cortex to release glucocorticoid hormones, which promote
energy metabolism (gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, and proteolysis) and anti-inﬂammatory activity. the increases in plasma
glucocorticoid levels then reduce the release of acth and
crh through a negative feedback mechanism, thereby
preventing excessive gc stimulation that can lead to
depression and also neurodegenerative disorders (pedersen
et al. 2001).

 xxxd2738xxx 
until recently, no was regarded mainly as a toxic air
pollutant produced by automobile engines and power plants.
its production by living cells was discovered only in the
1980s. in early studies performed at that time, rodent
macrophages were found to release increased amounts of
nitrate and nitrite (two products of no metabolism) after
exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps) (stuehr and
marletta 1985). these in vitro ﬁndings were later conﬁrmed
by the in vivo demonstration that lps administration
stimulates urinary nitrite and nitrate excretion in mice (billiar
et al. 1990). another important landmark in the characterization of no was the study by furchgott and zawadzki
(1980). they reported that acetylcholine or carbachol
stimulation of pre-contracted vascular smooth muscle preparations was followed by endothelial production of a shortlived vasodilator that was different from prostacyclin, and
they called this substance endothelium-derived relaxing
factor ( xxxd2738xxx ) (furchgott and zawadzki 1980). by 1987,
various pieces of evidence had been put together, and  xxxd2738xxx 
turned out to be none other than no (hutchinson et al. 1987;
ignarro et al. 1987; palmer et al. 1987), and shortly thereafter, l-arginine was identiﬁed as its precursor (palmer et al.
1988; stuehr et al. 1989). these seminal discoveries were
followed by reports demonstrating the important roles played
by no in the regulation of inﬂammation, smooth muscle
relaxation, and the immune response (bogdan 2001; coleman 2001; rattan 2005).
the ﬁrst evidence of no’s activity as a neurotransmitter
was reported by garthwaite et al. (1988) they demonstrated
that glutamate stimulation of cerebellar nmda receptors
caused neurons to release a diffusible molecule with features
very similar to those of  xxxd2738xxx . in the years that followed,
no’s multiple functions in the cns were documented,
including the roles it played in cognitive function (induction
and maintenance of synaptic plasticity) and the control
of sleep, appetite, body temperature, and neurosecretion

fig. 1 synthesis of no. in the presence of oxygen, nadph, and cofactors, such as heme, flavins (fmn, fad), tetrahydrobiopterin and thiols,
 xxxd2738xxx  synthase (nos) catalyzes the 5-electron oxidation of the terminal guanidino nitrogen of l-arginine, which results in the formation of
 xxxd2429xxx  and  xxxd2738xxx  free radical (•no).

(mccann 1997; rivier 2001, 2002, 2003; guix et al. 2005;
calabrese et al. 2007). and in the peripheral nervous system,
no was shown to regulate the non-adrenergic non-cholinergic relaxation of smooth muscle in the corpora cavernosa
and the gastrointestinal tract (van geldre and lefebvre 2004;
toda et al. 2005).
 xxxd2738xxx  synthesis is catalyzed by the  xxxd2738xxx 
synthase (nos,  xxxg1577xxx   xxxg1578xxx   xxxg1579xxx ) family of enzymes. in the
presence of oxygen and nadph, these enzymes convert
l-arginine to into  xxxd2429xxx  and no (fig. 1). three nos
isoforms have been identiﬁed in the cns and in peripheral
structures: (i)  xxxg1577xxx  ( xxxg1577xxx , type i); (ii) endothelial
nos (enos; type iii); and (iii)  xxxg1578xxx  (inos, type
ii) (bredt 1999; guix et al. 2005). activation of the
different nos isoforms requires various factors and
cofactors. formation of a calcium/calmodulin complex is
necessary for the dimerization of both  xxxg1577xxx  and enos,

table 1 main factors regulating  xxxd2738xxx 
production through effects exerted on nitric
oxide synthase (nos) isoforms

and their enzymatic activity also requires cofactors such as
tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4), ﬂavins, and thiols (bredt 1999).
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes also play
important roles in regulating the activity of these two
nos isoforms. several kinases and phosphatases are known
to increase or decrease nos activity, and speciﬁc phosphorylation sites have also been identiﬁed in the nos
sequences (table 1; boo and jo 2003; zhou and zhu 2009).
endogenous factors and disease states can also stimulate
enos and  xxxg1577xxx  activity and/or expression, thereby
increasing no production (table 1) (chatterjee et al.
2008; zhou and zhu 2009). unlike enos and  xxxg1577xxx ,
inos can bind to calmodulin even in the presence of very
low intracellular concentrations of calcium, so its ability to
generate no is calcium-independent (schulz et al. 1992;
xie et al. 1992). in the brain,  xxxg1577xxx  has been found in
neuronal populations of the cerebral cortex, striatum,

hippocampus (ca1 region and dentate gyrus), the lateral
dorsal and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei, the cerebellum (granule cells), and the hypothalamic pvn and son
(dawson and snyder 1994).  xxxg1577xxx  immunoreactivity has also been detected in astrocytes, cerebral blood
vessels, and the posterior pituitary (dawson and snyder
1994; guix et al. 2005).  xxxg1577xxx   xxxg1579xxx  is expressed by
vascular endothelial cells in the brain, and it regulates
cerebral blood ﬂow, but enos immunoreactivity has also
been detected in the cerebellum, olfactory bulb, cerebellar
cortex, dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, and the bed
nucleus of the stria terminalis (bredt et al. 1990). inducible
nos levels in the cns are generally fairly low. however,
expression in astrocytes and microglia increases following
viral infection or trauma (dawson and dawson 1996).
activation of inos requires gene transcription, and its
induction can be inﬂuenced by amyloid-b-peptide, lps, and
proinﬂammatory cytokines. activation can also be blocked
by glucocorticoids, inhibitory cytokines, prostaglandins
(pg), tissue growth factors, and protein synthesis inhibitors
(sharma 1998; guix et al. 2005) (see also table 1).
 xxxd2738xxx  and the stress axis
immunohistochemical studies have revealed increased levels
of  xxxg1577xxx  mrna and protein and enhanced  xxxg1577xxx  activity in
the pvns of rats exposed to stressful conditions, such as
forced swimming, immobilization, and endotoxin administration (lee et al. 1995; kishimoto et al. 1996; tsuchiya
et al. 1997; kostoglou-athanassiou et al. 1998; sanchez
et al. 1999). interestingly, simultaneous exposure to neurogenic stress (e.g., restraint) and immuno-inﬂammatory stress
(e.g., administration of lps) stimulated the no system in the
rat pvn to a greater extent than either stress alone (yang
et al. 1999). signiﬁcant increases in  xxxg1577xxx  mrna and
activity have also been described in the anterior pituitary and
adrenal gland (kishimoto et al. 1996) of rats subjected to
neurogenic stress.
despite the strength of these morphological data, no’s
functional contribution to the regulation of stress-axis
activity is still questioned. it has, in fact, been found to
exert both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the hpa axis
(fig. 2). early studies showed that l-arginine, the precursor
of no, and no donors had no effect on basal release of crh
or avp in rat hypothalamic explants, but they signiﬁcantly
reduced the secretion of these neuropeptides stimulated by
k+ and il-1b (costa et al. 1993; yasin et al. 1993). in
contrast, karanth et al. (1993) found that l-arginine
enhanced both the basal and il-2-stimulated release of
crh from rat mediobasal hypothalami, and this effect was
reduced by the non-selective nos inhibitor l-ng-monomethyl arginine. these contradictory in vitro ﬁndings were
followed by in vivo studies, which showed that no’s role in
the regulation of the stress axis depends on the brain area
involved and the type of stress.

can exert permissive (solid arrows) or preventive (dotted arrows)
effects on the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, depending on the
type of stressor. no blunts stress-axis activation triggered by bloodborne signals, such as il-1b or  xxxd3495xxx  (avp), by
reducing the release of  xxxd1752xxx -releasing hormone (crh),
 xxxg1801xxx  hormone (acth), and corticosterone. (a stimulatory role for no on the il-2-mediated release of crh from rat
mediobasal hypothalamus has been documented in only one study;
karanth et al. 1993). as for the stress-axis activity caused by bacterial lipolysaccharide (lps) stimulation, no reduces acth release
elicited by low-dose lps exposure and increases that produced by
exposure to high-dose lps. when the stress is neurogenic in origin,
no enhances stress-axis activation by increasing the release of crh
and avp from the hypothalamus and acth from the pituitary gland.
no blocks the release of pituitary acth and adrenal corticosterone
in response to cholinergic agonists, but it exerts permissive effects
on the a2-adrenoceptor-mediated increase of acth release. in the
paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus, no
increases the gaba-mediated post-synaptic currents, thus reducing
neuronal excitability and exerting a negative control on the stress
axis.

it is well established that blood-borne signals, including
circulating il-1b, lps, or avp, act preferably at the
pituitary-median eminence level. rivier and shen (1994)
found that inhibition of no synthesis in rats signiﬁcantly
increased the plasma levels of acth and corticosterone
observed after peripheral administration of il-1b. similarly,
the nos inhibitor ng-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester
(l-name) exacerbated the acth increase provoked by
intravenous administration of avp, but not crh (rivier and
shen 1994). interestingly, however, the inhibition of nos
activity did not affect the hpa activation induced by the
intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of il-1b
(rivier and shen 1994). the effect of bacterial lps on the
hpa axis, which is mediated at least in part by no, is quite
complex. low-dose lps administration (0.5 lg/kg) is associated with activation of the stress axis in rats, as reﬂected by
signiﬁcant increases in plasma acth levels, and this effect
is potentiated by concomitant peripheral administration of
l-name. it is worth noting that the effect of l-name in this
experimental system was counteracted by immunoneutralization of endogenous avp, thus demonstrating the importance of the no–avp interaction (rivier 2003). high-dose

lps administration (> 50 lg/kg) also increased plasma
acth, but this effect was inhibited by l-name and
unrelated to endogenous avp. therefore, it is probably
caused by marked neuronal activation at the pvn level
(rivier 2003).
neurogenic stressors, such as sustained physical exercise,
mild footshock, or restraint, can modulate hpa axis activity
through effects exerted at either the hypothalamic or pituitary
level. in rats and pigs, the inhibition of nos activity
decreases the acth response to restraint or shock and the
up-regulation of crh and avp transcription in the hypothalamic pvn, whereas the i.c.v. administration of no
increases crh and avp transcript levels in this nucleus
(turnbull et al. 1998; rivier 2001, 2003; jankord et al.
2009). in contrast, l-name acts at the hypothalamic level to
augment the increased acth levels caused by physical
exercise (jankord et al. 2009).
the hpa axis is under the control of several neurotransmitters. it has been clearly demonstrated that the stress axis is
strongly stimulated by activation of the central cholinergic
and adrenergic systems, whereas activation of the gabaergic system by stimulation of the gabaa receptor subtype
exerts a tonic negative effect (grossman et al. 1993; jessop
1999; bugajski et al. 2004) (fig. 2). increased hypothalamic
release of crh has been observed after cholinergic stimulation in the rat (calogero et al. 1988, 1989; grossman et al.
1993; ohmori et al. 1995). the acetylcholine-receptor
(muscarinic and nicotinic) agonists, carbachol and nicotine,
increase plasma levels of acth and corticosterone in rats,
and this effect is potentiated by the nos inhibitors ng- xxxd2741xxx -arginine and l-name (gadek-michalska and bugajski
2005; bugajski et al. 2006). interestingly, nos inhibitors
exacerbate the carbachol-induced hpa activation in rats
concomitantly exposed to the neurogenic stress of crowding
(bugajski et al. 2006). as for the adrenergic system, the
blockade of no synthesis by l-name or l-n6-(1-iminoethyl)lysine, which is a selective inhibitor of inos reportedly
reduces the secretion of acth and corticosterone elicited by
stimulation of a1, a2, and b-adrenoreceptors in rats
(bugajski et al. 2004; gadek-michalska and bugajski
2008). however, seo et al. (2003) demonstrated that only
the acth release stimulated by the a2 subtype is modulated
by no. regarding the gabaergic system, no, alone or
combined with physicoemotional stress, such as forced
swimming, has been found to increased gaba release in the
rat son (engelmann et al. 2002). in the pvn and son, this
gas has also been shown to increase the frequency of
miniature inhibitory gabaergic post-synaptic currents, thus
reducing neuronal excitability and contributing to the
negative control of hpa axis activity (stern and ludwig
2001; li et al. 2003).
 xxxd2738xxx  has been demonstrated to exert most of its
physiological functions, including smooth muscle cell relaxation and neurotransmission, via activation of the soluble

fig. 3 the main signal transduction pathways involved in the biological activities of no, co, and h2s. no and co – formed by  xxxd2738xxx 
synthase (nos) and heme oxygenase (ho) activities, respectively
(see fig. 4) – interact primarily with hemoproteins and activate soluble
 xxxg1587xxx  (sgc) and cyclooxygenase (cox) (solid arrow). by
modulating the activity of these enzymes, no and co regulate neurotransmission, smooth muscle relaxation, cell survival, and neuropeptide release. h2s, which is formed by cystathionine-b-synthase
(cbs) and cystathionine-c-lyase (cse) activities (see fig. 6), stimulates adenylyl cyclase (ac), mitogen-activated protein kinases
(mapk), atp-sensitive potassium channels, and the transcription
factor  xxxg1556xxx -related factor-2 (nrf2), thereby controlling neuronal
activity, vascular smooth muscle relaxation, cell proliferation, and the
oxidant/antioxidant balance (solid arrow). the three gases can also
interact with one another in numerous and complex ways. theoretically speaking, both no and co could inhibit cbs activity, thus
reducing h2s formation through this pathway, but a careful analysis of
the binding constants suggests that only co plays a role in such
regulatory loop (for further information see text). moreover, h2s
scavenges no, transforming it into an inactive s-nitrosothiol (dotted
arrow). h2s also stimulates ho activity and increases co formation by
activating nrf2 (solid arrow), a well-known activator of  xxxg1062xxx . in this
case, the co-mediated inhibition of cbs mentioned above represents
a negative feed-back mechanism designed to avoid excessive stimulation of co formation by h2s.

(sgc/cgmp) and downstream regulation of protein kinase g
or cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (fig. 3; calabrese et al.
2007). the importance of the no/sgc/cgmp system in the
modulation of the hpa axis has yet to be deﬁned. no/sgc/
cgmp signaling has been shown to increase the release of
 xxxg930xxx  (gnrh) from the rat hypothalamus (canteros et al. 1995), but activation of this
pathway does not appear to be necessary for the hypothalamic release of crh or avp (terrell et al. 2003; kadekaro
2004). the latter conclusion was recently challenged by the
results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over
clinical trial, in which healthy male athletes were treated
with tadalaﬁl, a long-acting type-v phosphodiesterase inhibitor that increases cgmp concentrations. exercise-induced
activation of the hpa axis, assessed by measurement of

by tadalaﬁl (di luigi et al. 2008). induction of cyclooxygenase (cox,  xxxg573xxx   xxxg579xxx   xxxg1883xxx   xxxg1884xxx .1) and the increased pg levels it
produces play major roles in hpa axis activation (fig. 3).
inhibition of pg synthesis has been shown to inhibit the
stimulatory effect of il-1b on acth release in rats and its
potentiation by l-name (rivier 1998). prostaglandin
blockade also counteracts the l-name- and ng-nitro-larginine-induced increases in acth and corticosterone
release triggered by nicotine administration in rats (bugajski
et al. 2004).

milieu have been studied extensively (mancuso et al. 2003,
2006b,c, 2008; stocker 2004; barone et al. 2009) (fig. 4).
the physiologic importance of co was ﬁnally revealed by
verma et al. (1993) who demonstrated the role played by this
gas in synaptic plasticity. these seminal observations were
followed by several papers demonstrating the importance of
co as an endogenous neuromodulator in both the central and
peripheral nervous systems. in particular, co (along with
no) was shown to be involved in the regulation of
hippocampal long-term potentiation, non-adrenergic noncholinergic smooth muscle relaxation, inﬂammation, and
apoptosis (wu and wang 2005).
given the ubiquitous distribution of the inducible and
constitutive isoforms of ho ( xxxg1062xxx  and  xxxg1063xxx , respectively),
the generation of co can reasonably be expected to occur in
all organs. as far as the nervous system is concerned, neurons
are characterized by very high ho activity under basal
conditions. most of this activity is accounted for by  xxxg1063xxx ,
which is expressed in neuronal populations of the forebrain,
hippocampus, hypothalamus, midbrain, basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, and brainstem (maines 1997). heme
oxygenase-1 is present in much smaller amounts and is
localized in scattered groups of neurons, including the
ventromedial nucleus and pvn of the hypothalamus (maines
1997). therefore, it seems that activation of  xxxg1062xxx  and  xxxg1063xxx 
resulting in the formation of co can be induced by numerous
noxious stimuli (table 2) within nuclei that play primary
roles in the central regulation of the stress response (mancuso
2004). more recently,  xxxg1062xxx  has been found in gt1-7 cells, a
hypothalamic neuronal cell line endowed with neuroendocrine activity in vitro (mores et al. 2008).  xxxg1062xxx  has also been
detected in glial cells, where its expression can be induced by
oxidative stress (dwyer et al. 1995).

carbon monoxide
carbon monoxide is one of the most toxic molecules in
nature. it is formed during the combustion of organic
material, including wood or coal, under low oxygen tension,
and it binds irreversibly to oxyhemoglobin, thereby preventing oxygen delivery to tissues (wu and wang 2005). as a
result of its lethal nature, co has been extensively studied
over the last 50 years, mainly from a toxicological point of
view. however, in 1963, endogenous production of co in
man was documented (coburn et al. 1963) although the
biochemical pathway leading to its formation and its
physiologic importance remained obscure. later, tenhunen
et al. (1969) described heme oxygenase (ho,  xxxg1062xxx   xxxg1063xxx ),
a microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of the
alpha-meso-carbon bridge of heme moieties, generating
equimolar amounts of co,  xxxd2385xxx , and biliverdin
(fig. 4). heme oxygenase is functionally coupled to the
cytosolic enzyme biliverdin reductase ( xxxg630xxx .24), which
reduces biliverdin to bilirubin, an endogenous molecule
whose interactions with free radicals in the intracellular

moieties derived from hemoproteins are

then undergoes reductive modification at
the c10 (c bridge) by the nad(p)h-requiring enzyme biliverdin reductase (bvr),
which yields bilirubin as the final product.

carbon monoxide and the stress axis
the ﬁrst study to address the potential impact of co on the
hpa axis was conducted by pozzoli et al. (1994). hemin, the
precursor of co in the ho system, was found to have no
effect on the basal release of crh in rat hypothalamic
explants, but it signiﬁcantly reduced that stimulated by k+ or
by il-1b. this effect was attributed to co, rather than to
hemin itself, because it was signiﬁcantly diminished by the
ho inhibitor zinc-protoporphyrin-ix (pozzoli et al. 1994)
(fig. 5). co’s major role in the regulation of the stress axis
was later corroborated by studies showing that (i) hemin is
transformed into biliverdin and co in the rat hypothalamus
under the same experimental conditions that inhibit stimulated crh release, and (ii) the increased co formation is
responsible for the inhibition of k+-stimulated avp and
oxytocin release in rat hypothalamic explants in vitro (fig. 5)
(kostoglou-athanassiou et al. 1996, 1998; mancuso et al.
1997a). the latter effect was indeed mediated by co
formation because it was counteracted by ho inhibitors

and reproduced by direct incubation of hypothalami in cosaturated medium (kostoglou-athanassiou et al. 1996, 1998;
mancuso et al. 1997a). importantly, neither biliverdin nor
bilirubin had any effect on basal or stimulated release
of crh, avp, or oxytocin (pozzoli et al. 1994; kostoglouathanassiou et al. 1996; mancuso et al. 1997a). these
in vitro ﬁndings were later conﬁrmed by the results of
in vivo studies, which are much more difﬁcult to carry out
owing to the relative inability of metalloporphyrins, including
hemin, to cross the blood–brain barrier at pharmacological
doses. to overcome this limitation, the metalloporphyrins
were administered to rats by the i.c.v. route. under these
conditions, tin-protoporphyrin-ix, a well-known inhibitor of
ho activity and co synthesis, signiﬁcantly potentiated the
lps-induced increase in circulating avp levels while reducing the hypothalamic content of this neuropeptide (mancuso
et al. 1999). the results of these studies are consistent with the
view that ho products (probably co) exert inhibitory effects
on the stimulated release of crh, avp, and oxytocin by
speciﬁc hypothalamic neurons.
although it is only indirectly related to the stress axis,
co’s effect on the release of gnrh is worth mentioning. in
in vitro studies, hemin caused dose-dependent increases in
basal gnrh release in both hypothalamic explants and
immortalized cells, and these effects were speciﬁcally
inhibited by zinc-protoporphyrin-ix (brann et al. 1997) in
the rat. although the mechanism of co’s action on gnrh
release has not been fully investigated, it is reasonable to
hypothesize that pgs are involved, since co has been
shown to increase prostaglandin (pg) e2 production in the rat
hypothalamus (mancuso et al. 1997b, 1998), and this
prostanoid is known to be a major physiological stimulus
to gnrh release (rivest and rivier 1995; mancuso et al.
1997c). these results highlight co’s opposite effects on
gnrh and crh release. it is well established that stress and
reproductive function are inversely related. for example,  xxxg1170xxx , a well-known mediator of inﬂammatory stress, increases
crh and neurohypophyseal hormone release while blunting
gnrh secretion via a direct action at the hypothalamic level
(rivest and rivier 1995). within this framework, co’s role
appears to be physiologically consistent: it prevents excessive hpa axis activation and, at the same time, enhances
reproductive processes.
a peculiar manifestation of hpa axis activation is an
increase in body temperature. rats exposed to a variety of
neurogenic stress stimuli, such as restraint, handling, or cage
switching, exhibit increases in body temperature referred to
as stress fever (oka et al. 2001). papers by luiz branco’s
group have clearly demonstrated that co is a mediator of this
pyrogenic response (fig. 5). additional support for this
hypothesis emerged from studies by sanchez et al. (1999)
and steiner and branco (2000, 2001), who found that ho
inhibition decreases lps-induced fever in rats, whereas heme
overload triggers increases in body temperature. more

recently, these investigators studied the relationship between
the ho–co system and physicoemotional stress in rats
(steiner et al. 2003). they found that i.c.v. administration of
the ho inhibitor zinc-deuteroporphyrin-bis-glycol had no
effect on the body temperature of euthermic rats, but it
markedly attenuated restraint-induced fever (steiner et al.
2003). these results conﬁrmed that the ho–co pathway is
not involved in the tonic regulation of body temperature, but
when ho is activated by a speciﬁc stimulus co becomes a
pyrogenic neuromodulator.
early studies showed that co exerts its biological effects
in the nervous system by activating cytosolic sgc and
thereby increasing intracellular cgmp levels (maines 1997;
steiner et al. 2002) (fig. 3). this paradigm has been
challenged by several reports, which demonstrated that co
is only a weak activator of sgc. indeed, it causes a much
less substantial increase (up to fourfold) in cgmp production
(burstyn et al. 1995; kharitonov et al. 1995; ma et al. 2007)
than that elicited by no (100-fold) (kharitonov et al. 1995;
ma et al. 2007). these ﬁndings and those from previous
studies on no/cox interaction suggested that the neuroendocrine effects of co might be ascribed to its regulation of
cox, an enzyme that is abundantly expressed throughout the
brain, including the hypothalamus (breder et al. 1992,
1995). studies by our group have demonstrated close
correlation between co levels, which inﬂuence the release
of hypothalamic neuropeptides (crh, avp and oxytocin),
and cox activity (mancuso et al. 2006a, 2007). in fact,
hemin increased cox activity in rat hypothalamic explants
and in primary cultures of rat hypothalamic astrocytes. the
increase in pge2 formation was inhibited by the speciﬁc ho
inhibitor tin-mesoporphyrin-ix and reversed by the co
scavenger hemoglobin, which shows that it was indeed the
result of co generation stemming from the ho-mediated
degradation of hemin (mancuso et al. 1997b). rat hypothalamic explants incubated in co-saturated medium also
exhibit signiﬁcant increases in pge2 release (mancuso et al.
1998). the role of pgs, in particular pge2, as endogenous
intermediates in the cytokine-stimulated activation of the
hpa is well established (rivest and rivier 1995). therefore,
these experiments provided early evidence of the role of
cox/pg pathway in the co-mediated activation of the
stress axis in the rat.

hydrogen sulfide
hydrogen sulﬁde (h2s) is the third member of the family of
gaseous neurotransmitters.  xxxd2738xxx  and co are odorless
gases and can reach toxic concentrations in the environment
without being detected. in contrast, h2s has a typical odor
that is often compared with that of rotten eggs. the human
nose can detect levels of h2s that are 400 times lower than
those found to be toxic (wang 2002), so h2s intoxication is
highly unlikely.

the ﬁrst evidence of endogenous h2s production in the
brain emerged in 1989 from studies of rats (where the gas
was found at concentrations close to 100 lm) and of normal
human postmortem samples (goodwin et al. 1989; warenycia et al. 1989; li and moore 2008). however, these ﬁgures
have recently been challenged by furne et al. (2008), who
reported endogenous h2s levels in the mouse brain and liver
of around 15 nm. later, endogenous production of h2s was
also demonstrated in vascular tissue (hosoki et al. 1997;
zhao et al. 2001).
for the most part, h2s is synthesized from l-cysteine by
cystathionine-b-synthase (cbs,  xxxg350xxx ) and/or cystathionine-c-lyase (cse,  xxxg543xxx .8) (wang 2002). in many
tissues, the two enzymes act in concert to generate h2s; in
others only one of the two is necessary (wang 2002). like
 xxxg1577xxx , enos, and  xxxg1063xxx  activities, cbs activity in the brain
is calcium/calmodulin-dependent (dominy and stipanuk
2004; li and moore 2008) (table 3). the presence of a
heme prosthetic group makes cbs sensitive to redox
changes, and this explains why it is inactivated in the
presence of increased intracellular levels of hydrogen
peroxide, no, and co (table 3) (taoka and banerjee
2001; maclean et al. 2002; łowicka and bełtowski 2007).
a careful analysis of the binding constants reveals that cbs
binds co 200-fold more tightly than it does no (taoka
and banerjee 2001). furthermore, the dissociation constant
of cbs for no is signiﬁcantly higher than for sgc
(300 lm vs. 0.25 lm) (stone and marletta 1996; taoka
and banerjee 2001). in this light, binding of no to cbs is
unlikely to occur under patho-physiological circumstances in

conversely, the more favorable kinetics makes co the
endogenous gas able to regulate h2s synthesis through cbs
activity (taoka and banerjee 2001). the expression of cse
can be induced by inﬂammatory stimuli, such as lps
(table 3) (li et al. 2005; li and moore 2008). interestingly,
both cbs and cse are active in the brain, although the
former is considered to be responsible for most of the h2s
production (awata et al. 1995; abe and kimura 1996; li and
moore 2008). the expression of cbs mrna has been
demonstrated in various areas of the rat brain, including the
hippocampus, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and brainstem
(abe and kimura 1996; li and moore 2008). hydrogen

oxidation, is far less important (searcy and lee 1998; wang
2002).
in the nervous systems of rodents and humans, h2s has been
implicated in the regulation of many functions, including the
induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation, nociception,
neuronal hyperpolarization (particularly in the ca1 region
of the hippocampus and the dorsal raphe nucleus), stimulation
of enteric neurons and the related prosecretory effects, and
smooth muscle relaxation (reiffenstein et al. 1992; wang
2002; schicho et al. 2006; kawabata et al. 2007; li and
moore 2008). numerous interactions between h2s and
intracellular signaling pathways have been documented. first
of all, the gas has been shown to be a direct activator of
adenylyl cyclase, atp-sensitive potassium channels, the
mitogen-activated protein kinase system, and the transcription
factor  xxxg1556xxx -related factor-2, and, through these pathways, it

regulates neuronal activity, vascular smooth muscle relaxation,
cell proliferation, and the oxidant/antioxidant balance, respectively (kimura 2000; zhao and wang 2002; yang et al.
2004a,b; tang et al. 2005; li and moore 2008; calvert et al.
2009). other biological actions of h2s depend on its interaction with other gaseous compounds. for example, h2s binding
to no results in the formation of an inactive nitrosothiol and
thereby reduces no-dependent signaling (li and moore
2007). it can also activate sgc or cox by up-regulating
 xxxg1062xxx  activity and increasing co formation (fig. 3).
hydrogen sulfide and the stress axis
hydrogen sulﬁde’s interactions with the hpa are not as
thoroughly documented as those of no and co. the
incubation of rat hypothalamic explants with nahs, which
releases h2s in solution, is known to reduce the k+stimulated release of crh, and a similar effect can be
obtained by treating hypothalamic tissue with s- xxxd3156xxx , a precursor of the h2s formed through cbs
activity (dello russo et al. 2000; navarra et al. 2000). this
in vitro evidence has been further supported by the results
of an in vivo study of rats treated with s- xxxd3156xxx  and then exposed to physical stress.  xxxd3156xxx  signiﬁcantly reduced the plasma corticosterone levels in rats exposed to cold (4c) for 1 h, but it had
no effect on basal glucocorticoid release (navarra et al.
2000).

conclusions
the importance of no, co, and h2s in the regulation of
the stress axis is beyond dispute, but their speciﬁc roles
include complex interactions with one another and effects
that vary with the characteristics of the stress and type of
cell/organisms involved.  xxxd2738xxx , co, and h2s do not
seem to be involved in the tonic regulation of the stress
axis, but they can reduce its excessive activation by
different stimuli. particularly important is the ability of
both no and co to reduce the release of hypophysiotropic
crh and avp triggered by exposure to immuno-inﬂammatory stressors, such as lps or il-1b. this highlights the
major role played by these gases in preventing the
potentially detrimental effects of excess gc production
during prolonged inﬂammatory states or infectious diseases
(costa et al. 1996). however, in the presence of physicoemotional stress, no and co may act in concert to
stimulate the stress axis, by inﬂuencing pvn activity
(turnbull et al. 1998). by reducing the hpa activation
triggered by other forms of neurogenic stress, such as
hypothermia, h2s can balance the stimulatory effects of
both no and co. finally, although it has been demonstrated only in vascular tissues (zhao et al. 2001), no’s
ability to induce endogenous h2s production could also be
important in the nervous system, and this may represent an

additional means by which the gaseous neurotransmitters
modulate the activity of the hpa axis.
