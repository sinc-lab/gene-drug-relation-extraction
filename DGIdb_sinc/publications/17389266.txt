bioenergetic and functional consequences of bone marrow-derived multipotent progenitor cell transplantation in hearts with postinfarction left vent...  the present study examined whether transplantation of adherent bone marrow-derived stem cells, termed pmultistem, induces neovascularization and cardiomyocyte regeneration that stabilizes bioenergetic and contractile function in the infarct zone and border zone (bz) after coronary artery occlusion.
