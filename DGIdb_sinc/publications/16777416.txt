abstract—a series of 3-o-acyl-6-o- xxxd3258xxx  of morphine,  xxxd1888xxx , n-methylmorphinium iodide, codeine, and dihydrocodeine were prepared and evaluated for their ability to bind to l-, d-, j1-, j2-, and j3-opiate receptors. several compounds
exhibited good aﬃnity for the l-opiate receptor. morphine-3-o-propionyl-6-o-sulfate had four times greater aﬃnity than morphine
at the l-opiate receptor and was the most selective compound at this receptor subtype.

opium contains a number of alkaloids, of which only a
few, that is, morphine, codeine, noscapine, and papaverine, have found clinical use.1 metabolites of codeine,
other than cyp2d6-dependent formation of morphine,
have also been reported to have central nervous system
eﬀects.2
metabolic conjugation (phase ii metabolism) usually
terminates the pharmacological action of a drug; however, in the case of morphine it has been observed that the
metabolite morphine-6b-glucuronide (m6g) is almost
100-fold more potent than morphine when administered
via the intracerebroventricular (icv) route in animals.3
the 3-o- and 6-o-sulfate conjugates of morphine (1)
have been known for many years.4–6 morphine-3-o-sulfate (2, m3s) is a known phase ii metabolite of morphine,7 and has been detected in rat tissues after
administration of morphine.8 however, morphine-6-osulfate (3a, m6s) has not been detected as a biotransformation product of morphine.7,9 while m3s has been
reported by several groups4–6 to have little or no in vivo
analgesic potency, brown et al.10 have reported this
compound to be three times more potent than morphine

as an analgesic when both compounds are administered
by the icv route in mice.
structural analogs of morphine that contain a 3-hydroxy group in their structure are generally 30- to 100fold more potent than their corresponding 3-methoxy
analogs at the l-receptor, and these compounds generally exhibit greater eﬃcacy (e.g., morphine produced 2fold greater maximal stimulation than its 3-methoxy
analog, codeine).11 furthermore, analgesic potency has
been shown to increase by sulfation of the 6-hydroxy
group of morphine.6,10 morphine-6-o-sulfate (3a,
m6s) has been shown to displace [3h]-morphine and
[3h]-leucine enkephalin binding in rat brain membranes
with ki values of 1.8 and 4.8 nm, respectively;12 this
study indicated that 6-o-sulfation of morphine results
in reduced aﬃnity for the l-receptor but enhanced aﬃnity for the j-receptor.
m6s is an eﬀective analgesic, with a 30-fold greater
potency than morphine in the mouse radiant heat tailﬂick assay, and is similar in potency to the active morphine metabolite, morphine-6b-glucuronide (m6g).13
3-o-acylation of the m6s molecule aﬀords more lipophilic derivatives that are considered to be prodrugs of
m6s.14,15 these o-acylated derivatives were found to
be relatively stable in phosphate-buﬀered saline over
the ph range 6–8, and were slowly hydrolyzed in blood
and brain homogenate to m6s.16 it has been demon-

strated that the 3-o-acetyl derivative of m6s (m3a6s,
3b) exhibits enhanced in vivo duration of antinociceptive activity compared to both m6s and morphine,
when given subcutaneously (sc) to rats, and has greater
potency and duration of action than morphine when
given to rats via the icv route.16,17
the relative stability and interesting antinociceptive proﬁle of m3a6s and other structurally related o-acyl analogs of m6s prompted us to undertake a comprehensive
structure–aﬃnity study of a number of 3-o-acyl derivatives of m6s and other congeners (fig. 1)18 to determine
the aﬃnity of these compounds for opiate receptors.
compounds 3a–i were prepared from 6-o-sulfation of
codeine or the appropriate 3-o-acyl analog of morphine, with pyridine-so3 reagent (scheme 1).
the dihydro analogs 4a–d were synthesized in a similar manner from dihydrocodeine or the appropriate 3o-acyl analog of  xxxd1888xxx . the betaines 3g
and 3h were obtained from pyridine-so3 sulfation of
3-o-acetyl-n-methylmorphinium iodide and 3-o-benzoyl-n-methylmorphinium iodide, respectively. m3s
(2) was prepared from direct sulfation of morphine,
and m6s (3a) and dm6s (4a) were prepared from
deacetylation of 3-o-acetylmorphine-6-o-sulfate and
3-o-acetyl- xxxd1888xxx -6-o-sulfate, respectively,
in meoh–naoh. x-ray crystallographic studies on

m3a6s demonstrated the presence of two independent
zwitter-ionic molecules per asymmetric unit.17 the stereotopic crystal structures of the two molecules indicated that they diﬀer from one another in the
relative conformation of the c- and d-rings. similar
to the parent morphine molecule,19 one of the structures incorporates the c- and d-rings in their boat
and chair conformations, respectively. however, in
the second structure, rings c and d exist in the
skew-boat and skew-chair forms. the presence of
two independent molecules in the crystal structure of
m3a6s provides an explanation for the observation
of the presence of several doublets in the solid state

hartley guinea pigs were decapitated and their brains
were quickly removed and weighed. the brains were
then homogenized in 50 mm tris–hcl buﬀer, ph
7.7 (about 25 ml/brain), using a polytron. the homogenate was centrifuged at 40,000g for 15 min, re-homogenized, and centrifuged. the ﬁnal pellet was
suspended in tris–hcl, ph 7.7, at a ﬁnal concentration of 6.67 mg original wet weight of tissue per milliliter, except for tissue prepared for nalbzoh
(naloxone benzoylhydrazone) binding, which was suspended in buﬀer containing 5 mm edta. the 6-osulfate congeners of morphine,  xxxd1888xxx , codeine, and dihydrocodeine in table 1 were evaluated
for their binding aﬃnities for l-, d-, j-1, j-2, and

j-3 opiate receptors utilizing guinea pig brain homogenate preparations. around 1 nm of morphine, metenkephalin, damgo (a l-selective agonist),
dpdpe-cl (a d-selective agonist), u69,593 (a j-1-selective agonist), and nalbzoh (a j-3-selective agonist)
were utilized as standard radioligands at these opiate
receptors. aﬃnities at j-2 receptors were determined
utilizing [3h]-bremazocine in the presence of 100 nm
damgo, u69,593, and dslet.
the guinea pig brain suspension (1.8 ml) was incubated
in 50 mm tris–hcl. nonspeciﬁc binding was deter-

mined by incubating in the presence of 1 lm of the
‘cold’ unlabeled counterpart of each labeled ligand, except that 10 lm nalbzoh was used for the j-3 receptor
assay. the samples were then ﬁltered through glass ﬁber
ﬁlters on a 48-well brandel cell harvester. the ﬁlters
were washed three times with 3 ml of buﬀer. filters were
incubated overnight with 5 ml of scintillation cocktail
before counting.
results are reported in terms of ic50 (concentration of
test compound that produces 50% inhibition of labeled
ligand binding). ki values (inhibitory dissociation

constant) are derived from the following equation:
ki = ic50/1 + [l]/kd. the kd values were obtained by
computer analysis of detailed self-inhibition curves for
each of the labeled ligands (l), using the curve-ﬁtting
program ligand.
the compounds listed in table 1 exhibited no aﬃnity
for j-2 receptors (data not shown) and only weak aﬃnity at j-1 receptors was observed. sulfation of the 6-hydroxy group of morphine aﬀorded the compound m6s,
which exhibited slightly improved aﬃnity over morphine for l-, d-, and j-3-receptors, and reduced aﬃnity
at j-1-receptors. the 7,8-dihydro analog, dm6s, had
similar activity to m6s.
sulfation of the 3-hydroxy group of morphine aﬀorded
m3s, which had little or no aﬃnity at any of the opiate
receptors examined. both codeine 6-o-sulfate (c6s) and
its dihydro derivative, dc6s, exhibited a signiﬁcant loss
in aﬃnity compared to m6s at all opiate receptors.
however, m3a6s, the 3-o-acetylated derivative of
m6s, exhibited comparable ki values to m6s at land j-3-receptors, but showed decreased aﬃnity for dreceptors, whereas the dihydro derivative, dm3a6s,
and the quaternary ammonium analog, mm3a6s both
had reduced aﬃnity compared to m3a6s in all the opiate receptor assays employed. the 3-o-propionyl
(m3pr6s), 3-o-isobutyryl (m3ibu6s), and 3-o-pivaloyl
(m3p6s) analogs of m6s all showed high aﬃnity for lreceptors and low aﬃnity for j-1 receptors. the sterically hindered ester, m3p6s, exhibited a very similar receptor aﬃnity proﬁle to the parent compound, m6s. both
the benzyl ester, m3b6s, and its dihydro derivative,
dm3b6s, were less potent than their respective parent
compounds, m6s and dm6s, at all the opiate receptors
examined. interestingly, the betaines, mm3a6s and

mm3b6s, had low aﬃnity in all the opiate receptor assays employed.
the above data clearly demonstrate that 3-o-acylation
of m6s and related compounds gives rise to molecules
with high aﬃnity for the l-receptor. the 3-o-propionyl
analog, m3pr6s, was the most potent l-receptor ligand
in the series, exhibiting a ki of 600 nm. m3pr6s exhibited a proﬁle similar to morphine, but was slightly more
potent at l-receptors. it is unlikely that these compounds are hydrolyzing to m6s in the binding assay
buﬀer, since previous studies have shown that m3a6s,
the compound likely to be the most labile 3-o-acyl analog of m6s, hydrolyzes relatively slowly to m6s in phosphate-buﬀered saline over the ph range 6.0–8.0 and is
not converted to morphine under these conditions.16
interestingly, the rates of enzymatic hydrolysis of
m3a6s in blood and brain were relatively faster than
in buﬀer, and hydrolysis in rat brain was considerably
faster than in blood.16 thus, these 3-o-acyl derivatives
of m6s, although originally considered to be prodrugs,
also exhibit high aﬃnity for l-receptors. this may explain the relatively prolonged duration of analgesia produced by these compounds in in vivo experiments in the
rat when compared to morphine. this is likely due to
these active 3-o-acyl compounds having plasma halflives greater than 1 h, and to the fact that subsequent
metabolism by plasma esterases will aﬀord the 3-odeacylated active parent compound.
