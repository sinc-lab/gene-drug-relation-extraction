induction of cox-2 activity in cerebral ischemia results in increased neuronal injury and infarct size. recent
studies investigating neurotoxic mechanisms of cox-2 demonstrate both toxic and paradoxically protective effects of downstream prostaglandin receptor signaling pathways. we tested whether misoprostol,
a pge2 receptor agonist that is utilized clinically as an anti-ulcer agent and signals through the protective pge2  xxxg1873xxx , ep3, and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors, would reduce brain injury in the murine middle cerebral artery
occlusion–reperfusion (mcao-rp) model. administration of misoprostol, at the time of mcao or 2 h after
mcao, resulted in signiﬁcant rescue of infarct volume at 24 and 72 h. immunocytochemistry demonstrated dynamic regulation of the  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors during reperfusion in neurons and endothelial
cells of cerebral cortex and striatum, with limited expression of  xxxg1874xxx . ep3−/− mice had no signiﬁcant changes in infarct volume compared to control littermates. moreover, administration of misoprostol
to ep3+/+ and ep3−/− mice showed similar levels of infarct rescue, indicating that misoprostol protection
was not mediated through the  xxxg1874xxx . taken together, these ﬁndings suggest a novel function for
misoprostol as a protective agent in cerebral ischemia acting via the pge2  xxxg1873xxx  and/or  xxxg1875xxx  receptors.

a neurotoxic effect of  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) has been demonstrated in rodent models of focal cerebral ischemia [10,16,21,22].
the cyclooxygenases cox-1 and cox-2 catalyze the ﬁrst committed step in the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxane, which
are lipid signaling molecules that participate in a broad range of
physiologic and pathologic processes, including synaptic plasticity, neuronal injury, and neuroinﬂammation (reviewed in [15]). the
ﬁve prostanoids pge2 ,  xxxg1073xxx  , pgi2 , pgf2␣ , and txa2 bind to distinct g-protein coupled receptors (gpcrs), designated as the ep,
dp, ip, fp, and tp receptors, respectively (reviewed in [8]). activation of prostaglandin (pg) receptors leads to changes in the
production of camp and/or phosphoinositol turnover and intracellular ca2+ mobilization. further complexity occurs in the case
of pge2 , which can bind four receptor subtypes (ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3,
and  xxxg1875xxx ) and  xxxg1073xxx  , which can bind to two different receptors
( xxxd1364xxx  and dp2), with distinct and potentially antagonistic signaling
cascades.

recent studies examining the mechanisms of cox-2 neurotoxicity have focused on the roles of individual prostaglandin
signaling pathways downstream of cox-2. although at least two
prostaglandin signaling pathways, the pge2 ep1 [2,17] and the
 xxxg1073xxx  dp2 receptors [18] have been found to be neurotoxic, an
important ﬁnding has been that a larger group of prostaglandin
receptors can mediate a paradoxical and signiﬁcant protective
effect [6,18–20,26].  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxd1364xxx -mediated neuroprotection are
dependent on pka activation [18,20], and ep3 neuroprotection is
associated with increases in the pro-survival phospho-akt [6]. in
vivo, the pge2  xxxg1873xxx  exerts a signiﬁcant neuroprotective
effect in both focal and permanent mcao models [19,20] and the
 xxxg1875xxx  receptor exerts a protective effect against nmda excitotoxicity
in vivo [1]. the  xxxg1073xxx   xxxd1364xxx  receptor mediates signiﬁcant protection in vivo in neonatal hypoxic ischemic injury [25] and transient
focal ischemia [24]. thus, selected prostaglandin signaling systems
downstream of cox-2 exert potent beneﬁcial effects in the setting
of ischemia.
misoprostol is a widely used anti-ulcer agent in patients who are
at risk for non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug (nsaid)-mediated
gastritis and ulcer disease [23] and repletes cytoprotective levels
of pge2 necessary for maintaining integrity of the gastric mucosa.
misoprostol binds the pge2  xxxg1873xxx , ep3, and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors (ki : 34,

fig. 1. misoprostol is protective in mcao-rp. (a) infarct volumes measured in cerebral cortex, caudate-putamen (cdpt), and hemisphere in mice treated with vehicle or
misoprostol (1 mg/kg) and subjected to 90 min mcao with 22.5 h survival (n = 10–11 per group; *p < 0.05). (b) representative coronal sections stained with ttc at 24 h
showing preservation of tissue with misoprostol administration. (c) misoprostol protected against ischemic infarction in cerebral cortex, cdpt, and hemisphere when given
2 h after mcao (n = 10–11 per group; *p < 0.05). (d) cbf was measured using laser doppler ﬂowmetry during ischemia and reperfusion and did not show differences between
vehicle and misoprostol (n = 4 per condition). ldf data was the average of values at 15 min intervals during ischemia/reperfusion. (e) infarct volumes remained signiﬁcantly
reduced at 72 h after mcao (n = 5 and 7 per group; *p < 0.05) when misoprostol was given 2 h after mcao, and again at 6 and 12 h after mcao. physiological parameters did
not differ between vehicle and misoprostol treatments (see supplementary table 1).

7.9, and 23 nm for  xxxg1873xxx , ep3, and  xxxg1875xxx , respectively [8]) increases
camp production, indicating activation of the  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors, which are positively coupled to adenylate cyclase. based on
our recent data demonstrating a protective role of the  xxxg1873xxx  in cerebral ischemia [19,20], we tested whether misoprostol, an
agonist at this receptor, would reduce infarct volume in the mcao
model of transient focal ischemia. results of this study indicate
that misoprostol exerts a pronounced protective effect in mcao
followed by reperfusion, and that it exerts this effect through the
 xxxg1873xxx  and/or  xxxg1875xxx  receptors in vivo.
this study was conducted in accordance with the national institutes of health guidelines for the use of experimental animals and
protocols were approved by the institutional animal care and use
committee. for mcao-rp studies, male mice aged 10–12 weeks
(20–25 g) were used. for the ep3−/− and +/+ mcao-rp studies (see
supplementary data), male 12-week-old mice were used.
focal cerebral ischemia was induced by 90 min of reversible
right mca occlusion (mcao) under isoﬂuorane anesthesia followed by 22.5 or 72 h of reperfusion and terminal histopathology,
as previously described [20]. rectal temperature and intraischemic and 22.5-h neurological deﬁcits were assessed and did not
show differences between genotypes or treatments. monitoring of
physiological variables and laser doppler ﬂowmetry (ldf) were
performed in companion cohorts (n = 4/group) [20]. brain tissue
was also harvested from sham and mcao-rp mice for immunocytochemistry (see supplementary data).
mice were given three subcutaneous injections of either vehicle
(hydroxypropyl-methyl cellulose; hpmc) or 1 mg/kg misoprostol
in hpmc (1:100 misoprostol:hpmc; pﬁzer, groton, ct) [5] either
at onset of mcao or 2 h after mcao, followed by two subsequent
doses 6 and 12 h later (see supplementary data).
statistical analysis was performed by student’s t-test or one-way
analysis of variance (anova), followed by tukey post hoc analysis.
all data are reported as mean ± standard error of the mean (sem).
p values <0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.

misoprostol binds to the  xxxg1873xxx -4 receptors. from previous studies demonstrating protective effects of  xxxg1873xxx , ep3, and  xxxg1875xxx  receptor
activation in models of excitotoxicity or ischemia [1,19,20,26],
we hypothesized that misoprostol, which can bind all three ep
receptors, might also mediate pharmacological protection. administration of 1 mg/kg of misoprostol at the onset of 90 min of
mcao, followed by subsequent injections at 6 and 12 h of reperfusion resulted in a signiﬁcant rescue of tissue at 24 h (fig. 1a
and b). neurological scores were signiﬁcantly improved in the
misoprostol-treated cohort (2.4 ± 0.2 vs. 1.8 ± 0.2; p < 0.05). a second cohort of mice was subjected to mcao-rp, with misoprostol
administered 2 h after mcao, and two subsequent doses at 8 and
14 h. here, post-mcao administration of misoprostol again resulted
in a signiﬁcant rescue in cerebral cortex, striatum and hemisphere
(fig. 1c). neurological scores were also signiﬁcantly improved in
the misoprostol-treated group in this cohort (2.6 ± 0.3 vs. 1.7 ± 0.3,
p < 0.05). laser doppler ﬂow measurements did not demonstrate
any differences in ﬂow between vehicle and misoprostol groups
(fig. 1d). a ﬁnal cohort received misoprostol 2 h after mcao and
again at 6 and 12 h, and brains were examined at 72 h. comparable
protection was seen at this delayed time point (fig. 1e). neurological scores were also signiﬁcantly improved with misoprostol
treatment (2.6 ± 0.24 vs. 1.0 ± 0.22 vs. p < 0.05). these studies indicate that subcutaneous administration of misoprostol signiﬁcantly
reduced stroke volume and improved neurological scores if given
at the time of mcao or 2 h after onset of mcao out to 72 h of
reperfusion.
to determine the cellular substrates of misoprostol signaling
and protection, the temporal dynamics of  xxxg1873xxx , ep3, and  xxxg1875xxx  receptor expression were investigated in sham and mcao-rp mice at 4
and 24 h after mcao (see supplementary data). immunostaining for
ep3 was in accord with previous in situ hybridization studies [11]
and showed no signiﬁcant expression in striatum and cerebral cortex in sham and ischemic brains (data not shown). in sham treated
mice,  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors colocalized with neun in neurons

fig. 2.  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors are expressed in neurons under basal conditions (400× magniﬁcation). colocalization studies with the neuron-speciﬁc marker neun demonstrates staining of (a)  xxxg1873xxx  and (b)  xxxg1875xxx  in cortical neurons in frontal cortex. both  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  were broadly expressed in neurons of cerebral cortex, striatum, and hippocampus.

(fig. 2a and b; layers ii–iv of frontal cortex), and also colocalized
with factor viii, a marker of endothelial cells (not shown) indicating that the  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors are basally expressed in
neurons and in endothelial cells. at 4 h of reperfusion, neuronal
 xxxg1873xxx  staining decreased in parallel with neun in neurons in the
ischemic core, but  xxxg1873xxx  expression persisted in peri-infarct neunpositive neurons (data not shown). in addition, at 4 h of reperfusion,
 xxxg1873xxx  expression was markedly induced in endothelium in the periinfarct area and ischemic zones (fig. 3a), colocalizing with icam-1,
which is induced in endothelial cells as well as microglia following
mcao-rp.  xxxg1875xxx  showed a similar downregulation in neurons at 4 h
of reperfusion and a marked induction in endothelial cells (fig. 3b).
at 24 h after mcao,  xxxg1873xxx  but not  xxxg1875xxx  receptor expression persisted
in endothelium in the peri-infarct zone (fig. 3c). colocalization
studies with gfap and iba1, markers of astrocytes and microglia,
respectively, did not demonstrate localization of the  xxxg1873xxx  or  xxxg1875xxx 
receptors in these cell types during reperfusion (not shown). these
data indicate that  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  are dynamically regulated selectively
in neurons and endothelium during the course of reperfusion. neuronal expression of  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  is lost in the ischemic core by 4 h of
reperfusion, but remains in the peri-infarct zone. in endothelium,
levels of  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  receptor expression are upregulated early
in reperfusion at 4 h in the ischemic core and peri-infarct areas;
by 24 h of reperfusion, vascular expression of  xxxg1875xxx  has disappeared,
but  xxxg1873xxx  expression remains. the temporal dynamics of  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx 
cellular expression suggest that the pharmacological protection by
misoprostol may be mediated by neurons and/or endothelial cells.
to further establish whether misoprostol is acting selectively
via the  xxxg1873xxx  and/or  xxxg1875xxx  receptors, we tested whether the  xxxg1874xxx  mediated any protective effect by misoprostol. from previous
studies, it has been demonstrated that the  xxxg1873xxx  confers
signiﬁcant protection in the mcao-rp model [19,20] and that
pharmacological activation of  xxxg1875xxx  protects in a striatal model of
excitotoxicity [1]. we ﬁrst determined whether the  xxxg1874xxx 
functioned in mcao-rp. c57b6 male ep3−/− and +/+ mice were
subjected to mcao-rp. interestingly, infarct size and neurological scores did not show differences between genotypes (fig. 4a;
neurological scores for ep3+/+: 2.5 ± 0.3 vs. ep3−/− 2.0 ± 0.2), indicating that the  xxxg1874xxx  did not inﬂuence infarct size in vivo
at the 24-h time point. moreover, administration of misoprostol to

ep3−/− mice did not diminish the protective effect of misoprostol, and resulted in similar decreases in infarct volume compared
to ep3+/+ mice given misoprostol. these ﬁndings indicate that the
 xxxg1874xxx  does not inﬂuence outcome in mcao, and does not
transduce the protective effect of misoprostol (fig. 4b). thus, these
data, in combination with the immunostaining demonstrating a
dynamic regulation of  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  in penumbra with reperfusion
suggest that the positive effects of misoprostol are likely mediated
via the  xxxg1873xxx  and/or the  xxxg1875xxx  receptors in this model.
recent efforts to understand mechanisms of cox-2 neurotoxicity have uncovered both toxic and paradoxically protective effects
of selected prostaglandin signaling pathways in brain. in this study,
we have examined the effects of a commonly used anti-ulcer agent
that binds the pge2  xxxg1873xxx , ep3, and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors in a rodent model of
mcao-rp, and tested the hypothesis that this agonist would protect
against ischemia. subcutaneous injection of misoprostol resulted
in signiﬁcant reductions in infarct size when given at the time of
mcao and 2 h after the onset of mcao, with comparable protection at 24 and 72 h after mcao. there were no differences in blood
ﬂow as measured by ldf or physiological measurements between
treatments.
in vivo genetic and pharmacologic studies have demonstrated
the protective effects of  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  signaling in cerebral ischemia
and excitotoxicity, respectively [1,19,20]. to test whether misoprostol exerted a protective effect via the  xxxg1874xxx , we ﬁrst had to
determine the function of this receptor in vivo in mcao-rp. deletion of the  xxxg1874xxx  had no effect on infarct volume in the
present study. previous pharmacological examinations of ep3 function have shown a neuroprotective effect of this receptor in acute
nmda toxicity in organotypic hippocampal slices [26] and in spinal
cord slices subjected to chronic glutamate toxicity from blockade of astrocytic glutamate transporters; this latter ep3-mediated
neuroprotection was associated with an increase in levels of the
pro-survival phospho-akt [6]. the difference observed in vivo may
be due to a low abundance of  xxxg1874xxx  in brain regions supplied by the middle cerebral artery, in particular the striatum and
cerebral cortex as compared to the hippocampus [11], where there
are modest levels of ep3 expression in ca1-4 regions and dentate
gyrus. we also cannot exclude potential differences in species used
in organotypic and in vivo paradigms (rat vs. mouse) or brain matu-

rities (postnatal vs. 2-month brain) resulting in divergent effects of
ep3 signaling. the lack of effect of ep3 deletion is also in contrast
to a pharmacological study in which pre-administration of the ep3
agonist ono-ae-248 increased infarct volume in a mcao-rp [3].
several possible interpretations may be relevant here. ono-ae-248
binds selectively to ep3 over ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , and  xxxg1875xxx  in cho cells expressing these receptors [9], however its speciﬁcity and selectivity in
vivo are not known. in addition, genetic deletion and pharmacologic activation may not be completely complementary in the case
of the  xxxg1874xxx . the  xxxg1874xxx  has three distinct isoforms
derived by alternative splicing that vary at the carboxy terminus
that result in differential downstream signaling, desensitization,
and constitutive activity [4,7,12–14]. genetic deletion of ep3 would
result in ablation of all three isoforms whereas icv administration
of ep3 agonist may activate one or more isoforms depending on the
expression patterns of the ep3 isoforms in the setting of mcaorp, the brain penetration of the ep3 agonist into brain, and the
constitutive signaling properties and desensitization kinetics. for

the purposes of this study, however, administration of misoprostol to ep3−/− and +/+ mice showed similar levels of protection,
indicating that the protective effect of misoprostol in vivo was
not mediated by ep3 signaling, but rather by the  xxxg1873xxx  and/or  xxxg1875xxx 
receptors.
immunostaining experiments revealed a dynamic regulation of
 xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  expression during reperfusion. in early reperfusion
(4 h), neuronal  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  expression disappeared entirely in the
infarcted zone in parallel with neun, but endothelial  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx 
expression levels were markedly induced in the microvasculature,
as evidenced by colocalization of  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  with the endothelial
cell markers icam-1 (fig. 3) or factor viii (data not shown). by 24 h,
 xxxg1873xxx  but not  xxxg1875xxx  expression persisted in endothelium. this temporal
expression pattern suggests that the cellular targets of misoprostol during early and later phases of reperfusion may be endothelial
cells. in support of this hypothesis are negative ﬁndings from experiments in primary neuronal cultures and organotypic hippocampal
slices treated with either nmda (10 ␮m) or oxygen–glucose depri-

vation ( xxxg791xxx ) in which misoprostol (10 nm to 10 ␮m) did not elicit
any protective response (supplementary fig. 1).
in this study, we have identiﬁed a novel function for the pge2
receptor agonist misoprostol, a commonly used anti-ulcer agent
that promotes a signiﬁcant rescue of brain tissue in the mcao-rp
model of transient focal ischemia. misoprostol exerted signiﬁcant
protection against ischemia when given at the time of or 2 h after
stroke onset. these data indicate that misoprostol may have a
potential role as a protective agent in stroke patients, particularly
as it is currently approved for clinical use and well tolerated by
patients. the present study suggests that the protective effect of
misoprostol is mediated through the protective  xxxg1873xxx  and/or  xxxg1875xxx 
receptors in vivo.
