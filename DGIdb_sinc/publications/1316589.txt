receptor autoradiography
opioid receptor binding was measured in cryostat sections of supraoptic nucleus (son) and posterior pituitary of virgin and pregnant rats by
quantitative receptor autoradiography after in vitro incubation with [3h] xxxd2070xxx  or [3h](-)-bremazocine in the presence of unlabelled sub-typeselective agonists. mu-selective [ah] xxxd2070xxx -binding in the son was reduced on the last day (21) of pregnancy vs. virgin controls (9.9 _+2.2 vs. 31.7
+ 6.5 fmol/mg). kappa-selective [3h](-)-bremazocine binding to the son was not altered by pregnancy. kappa-selective [3h](-)-bremazocinebinding to the posterior pituitary was less on day 16 of pregnancy vs. virgin females (19.1 _+ 5.2 vs. 74.4 + 16.2 fmol/mg). the results suggest
mechanisms for the changes in actions of opioids on oxytocin neurones in pregnancy.

opioids can inhibit oxytocin secretion, and given during parturition opiates slow the delivery of pups by this
means [10, 24, 25]. in non-pregnant rats, and during
early pregnancy, the opioid antagonist naloxone has no
effect on plasma oxytocin levels, but in late pregnancy,
and especially during parturition, naloxone increases
oxytocin secretion and this shows that at these times oxytocin release is powerfully inhibited by endogenous
opioids [2, 13, 17].
opiates reduce oxytocin secretion both by inhibiting
the firing-rate of oxytocin neurones through actions on
their cell bodies in the supraoptic nucleus [16, 17], and by
acting on their axon terminals in the posterior pituitary
gland [3, 35]. with the use of selective radiolabelled
opioid ligands and in vitro autoradiography,/~-, ~-, and
x-opioid receptors have been found to be distributed differently in the rat brain [18, 19, 33, 36]. in the rat posterior pituitary gland only the x-type is present [14]; in the
supraoptic nucleus both x- and/~-types are present [17,
19,31].
the aim of the present study was to find out whether
the opioid restraint on oxytocin secretion in late pregnancy is accompanied by changes in opioid receptor
types in the supraoptic nucleus or posterior pituitary
correspondence." j.a. russell, department of physiology, university

gland. the median preoptic nucleus was included in the
study to see whether changes involved a region with a
known important projection to supraoptic neurones [24].
some of the results have been briefly summarised elsewhere [11, 27].
female sprague-dawley rats, kept in standard conditions, were used [26]. some were paired with males and
the day of finding a vaginal plug was designated day 0 of
pregnancy. pregnant (day 10, 16, 20 or 21 the day of
expected parturition) and virgin (b.wt. ca. 285 g) females
were killed by decapitation around 10.00 h and on the
same days. pregnant rats with less than 4 fetuses were
excluded; average number of fetuses was 13.2 + 0.7 (intergroup s.e.m.). the methods of tissue removal,
processing, incubation, autoradiography, and quantitative analysis have been described in detail elsewhere [31]
and will only be briefly described here.
the pituitary, and a thick coronal slice of brain containing the supraoptic nuclei (son) and the median
preoptic nucleus (mpn), were frozen onto cryostat
chucks, sectioned coronally  xxxd1891xxx  gm, and attached to
slides subbed with chrome alum-gelatine. in the son/2and x-selective binding was sought with [3h] xxxd2070xxx  or
[3h]bremazocine, respectively, in the presence of appropriate selective agonists. in the posterior pituitary xselective and/~-like [3h]bremazocine binding were similarly sought ([3h] xxxd2070xxx  is unsuitable for the posterior pituitary [31]). in the mpn untyped opioid-binding

217
was measured with [3h] xxxd2070xxx  alone. in each case naloxone-displacement was used to determine specific
binding to opioid receptors. the tissue sections were preincubated in buffer (for subsequent [3h] xxxd2070xxx  incubations this contained  xxxd2928xxx  to
displace endogenous opioid bound to receptors), and
then incubated (unfixed) in buffer containing [3h] xxxd2070xxx  (amersham international plc, aylesbury, uk) or
[3h](-)-bremazocine (nen research products, du
pont, stevenage, uk). control sections were incubated
with [3h]ligand in the presence of naloxone to determine
non-specific binding. sections incubated in buffer alone
served as controls for chemography.
for p-selective binding sections were incubated with
[3h] xxxd2070xxx  in the presence of [d-pen2,d-pens]-enke phalin (dpdpe, a 8-selective agonist [20]; sigma chemical co. ltd., poole, uk) and trans-(+)-3,4-dichloro-nmethyl-n-(2-[1-pyrrolidinyl]cyclohexyl)benzene- xxxd63xxx , methane sulphonate salt (u50,488h; a x or x-l-selective agonist [5, 36]; sigma). for x-selective binding, son
sections were incubated with [3h](-)-bremazocine in the
presence
of
tyr-d-ala-gly-mephe-nh(ch2) xxxd346xxx 
(dago; a p-selective agonist [8]; cambridge research
biochemicals, cambridge, uk) and dpdpe. this
approach was validated previously [31].
posterior pituitary sections were incubated with
[3h](-)-bremazocine either in the presence of d a g o
and dpdpe, or in the presence of dpdpe and
u50,488h, which were conditions intended to be selective for x- and p-receptors, respectively [see ref. 31]. no
binding was obtained after incubation with either
[3h]ligand in the presence of d a g o and u50,488h.
after incubation and washes, the sections were dried
and apposed to hyperfilm-3h, together with a tritium
standard (3h-microscale, amersham), and exposed for 9
weeks (brain sections) or 16 weeks (pituitary sections).
the films were processed and the tissue sections were
fixed and stained with cresyl fast violet. typical illustrations have been published previously [31].
silver-grain densities were measured with an imageanalysing computer with the measuring frame set at 202
x 133 p m (long axis transverse) [see ref. 31] over the
dorsal (predominantly oxytocin-synthesising) part of the
son (approx. bregma -1.3 mm [21]), the centre of the
part of the mpn ventral to the anterior commissure and
dorsal to the third ventricle (bregma -0.3 mm [21]), and
the peripheral (predominantly oxytocin-releasing) part
of the posterior pituitary gland (pp). background grain
densities were measured over film adjacent to the tissue
region being measured, but not over tissue, and subtracted. mean standard curves of grain density against
radioactivity in calibrated tissue equivalents were drawn
for the standards co-exposed with the brain or pituitary

21 was reduced by 69% compared with virgin rats
(p--0.04, anova; p<0.05, duncan's test; fig. l a).
in the son sections incubated with [3h](-)-bremazocine in the presence of dago and dpdpe (to select
x-binding sites), there were no significant effects of pregnancy (fig. lb). there was also no effect of pregnancy on
[3h] xxxd2070xxx  binding to the median preoptic nucleus
(fig. 2).
in pituitary gland sections incubated with [3h](-)-bremazocine, only the posterior pituitary gave an autoradiographic image. in posterior pituitary sections incubated with [3h](-)-bremazocine in the presence of
dago and dpdpe (to select x-binding sites), mean
specific binding was reduced on day 16 of pregnancy by
74.3% compared with virgin controls (p=0.04, anova;
p<0.05, duncan's test; fig. 3a); [3h](-)-bremazocine
binding in the presence of dpdpe and u50,488h ~ type binding, eliminated by addition of dago, data not
shown) was less than in virgin females on day 20
(p<0.025, anova; p<0.05, duncan's test; fig. 3b).
the results show that there is a significant reduction in
specific binding to/2- but not x-opioid binding sites in the
dorsal part of the son on the expected day of parturition. this suggests either a large loss (i.e. a downregulation), greatly reduced affinity or persistent occupation of
/2-binding sites by endogenous ligand in the son at this
late stage of pregnancy. of these suggestions, endogenous opioid occupation is the least likely since preincubation should displace ligands [31]. oxytocin
neurones predominate in the dorsal part of the son [32],
and the/2-binding site changes could result from altered
expression of opioid receptor genes by oxytocin
neurones as part of their programme of changes during
pregnancy, or as a response to changes in the amount or

types of endogenous opioid acting through them. the
present results on a discrete anatomically-defined region
of the hypothalamus contrast with reported increased
density of/2-receptors in extracts of whole hypothalamus
(including preoptic area) in pregnancy [9]. it has been
suggested that fl-endorphin, and/or enkephalins (other
than [met 5] or [leu 5] enkephalin), might be the endogenous ligands for the/2-type opioid receptor [l 5] and
their content is increased in the hypothalamus during
pregnancy [22, 34]. chronic exposure to the/2-selective
opiate morphine decreases the density of/j- but not icreceptors in the son [31], and leads to tolerance and
dependence of oxytocin neurones [1, 23]; it remains to be
shown whether similar tolerance and dependence of oxytocin neurones develop for endogenous /2-opioids in
pregnancy.
through its connections with the subfornical organ
the median preoptic nucleus may be involved in mediating the effects of circulating relaxin on oxytocin secretion
in pregnancy [24, 29]. however, our results suggest that
changes in opioid receptors in this pathway are not in-

219

volved in the altered opioid actions on oxytocin neurones
in pregnancy. in contrast, opioid receptor density in the
median preoptic nucleus is markedly reduced in rats
made morphine-tolerant [31].
previous studies have shown that the posterior pituitary gland contains exclusively or predominantly x-receptors [14, 31]. this is consistent with the finding that
x-selective agonists inhibit stimulated oxytocin release
from the posterior pituitary in vivo and in vitro [3, 6, 35].
these receptors are present both on oxytocin nerve terminals and on pituicytes [3], and possibly on vasopressin
nerve terminals also [35]. a likely endogenous x-receptor
ligand acting on oxytocin terminals is dynorphin,
released from adjacent vasopressin terminals [7, 12, 30].
interestingly, in vitro stimulation studies show decreased
effects of exogenous x-agonist (unpublished) and endogenously-released opioids (shown by naloxone) on oxytocin secretion towards the end of pregnancy [11], and
the decreased x-binding we now report may account for
these functional changes. a similar reduction in x-receptor binding in the posterior pituitary has been described during dehydration [4], and one explanation may
be that this results from downregulation induced by increased release of dynorphin. increased dynorphin
mrna content in the son and increased dynorphin
content in the posterior pituitary at the end of pregnancy
have been described [28], but these findings do not
resolve whether dynorphin release is increased in the posterior pituitary in pregnancy. [3h](-)-bremazocine binding to the posterior pituitary is incompletely displaced by
u50,488h and dpdpe in our conditions, unless dago
is also added [31], suggesting that a//-type opioid receptor is also present in the posterior pituitary, but this is
not regular b-binding since [3h] xxxd2070xxx  does not bind
and neither morphine nor dago inhibits oxytocin
release at this level [6, 35]. the functional significance of
the decrease in this type of binding near the end of pregnancy is not clear. the opioid-binding changes in the
posterior pituitary in pregnancy contrast with the lack of
change in morpine-tolerant rats [31], indicating that any
endogenous ligand that may be inducing posterior pituitary receptor changes in pregnancy is not morphine-like.
in conclusion the reduction in x-opioid binding in the
posterior pituitary in late pregnancy could explain reduced opioid inhibition of oxytocin secretion at this
level, while the reduction in b-type opioid binding in the
son at the end of pregnancy indicates that this is also an
important site of change in opioid action on oxytocin
neurones in pregnancy.
