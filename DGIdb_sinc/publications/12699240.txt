mechanism of  xxxd148xxx  synthase and the role of the protein environment in controlling the cofactor chemistry.   xxxd148xxx  synthase, a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme of the alpha-oxoamine synthase family, catalyzes the first step of the heme biosynthetic pathway in mammalian cells. this reaction entails the condensation of glycine with succinyl- xxxd1739xxx  to yield  xxxd148xxx , carbon dioxide and coa. mutations in the erythroid  xxxd148xxx  synthase gene lead to a defective enzyme and are associated with the erythropoietic disorder x-linked sideroblastic anemia. in the past few years, rapid scanning-stopped-flow spectroscopy and chemical quenched-flow studies of the alas reaction, under single- and multi-turnover conditions, have provided important results for the interpretation of the catalytic mechanism. in particular, the role of the protein scaffold in modulating the chemical reactivity of the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate cofactor and, thus, the catalytic pathway of alas has been investigated in our laboratory using transient kinetics and global analysis of the kinetic data.
