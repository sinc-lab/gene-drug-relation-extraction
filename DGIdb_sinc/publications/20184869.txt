 xxxg36xxx  inhibitor
continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis

a b s t r a c t
background: matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-2 plays an important role in tissue remodeling related to
inﬂammation during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (capd) therapy. but its inhibitors were not
applied clinically. we determined whether an  xxxg36xxx  (ace) inhibitor, captopril,
inhibits  xxxg1428xxx  activity in peritoneal efﬂuents from patients on capd, and simulated molecular models of
the  xxxg1428xxx –captopril complex.
methods: the inhibitory effect of captopril on  xxxg1428xxx  activity was measured in peritoneal efﬂuents from 17
patients on capd. molecular models of the  xxxg1428xxx –captopril complex were simulated by 1000 iterations of
random docking and energy minimization.
results: captopril directly inhibited  xxxg1428xxx  activity in peritoneal efﬂuents from patients on capd (ic50;
48 µmol/l), and that captopril binding to the  xxxg1428xxx  active site could be formed in each complex model
without molecular distortion.
conclusion: ace inhibitors, such as captopril, may be applied as important compounds for  xxxg1428xxx  inhibition
in inﬂammation caused by capd.

1. introduction
continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (capd) therapy has been
established as an alternative to hemodialysis for patients with end-stage
renal disease. however, long-term capd leads to peritoneal injury with
ultraﬁltration loss and insufﬁcient elimination, and encapsulating
peritoneal sclerosis (eps) is an infrequent but serious complication
[1–4]. in eps, ﬁbrous thickening and edema of the peritoneum occur,
and chronic inﬂammation with inﬁltration of mononuclear cells into the
peritoneum is seen. although the pathogenesis of eps has not been
clariﬁed, it appears to develop through the interaction of various factors
in conventional peritoneal dialysis ﬂuid, such as particulate matter,
plasticizers, ph and glucose, and infection with bacteria or fungi. eps has
a high mortality rate, with the direct cause of death considered to be
malnutrition or sepsis. therefore, prevention of eps is necessary for safe
capd and to extend capd treatment periods.
eps involves tissue destruction and excessive remodeling, and matrix
metalloproteinases (mmps) play an important role in this remodeling. in
patients with eps,  xxxg1428xxx  levels in the peritoneal efﬂuent reﬂect
peritoneal solute transport and are associated with peritoneal injury [5].
 xxxg1428xxx  degrades components of the extracellular matrix, such as type iv
collagen and ﬁbronectin, which comprise the basement membrane, and

plays an important role in the promotion of ﬁbroplasia. in experimental
models,  xxxg1428xxx  levels in drained dialysates became signiﬁcantly elevated
with the development and progression of sclerosis peritonitis [6–8].
 xxxg36xxx  (ace) inhibitors have been shown
to have protective effects in patients with renal failure and to improve
survival [9,10]. in patients on hemodialysis or capd, therapy with ace
inhibitors is associated with a markedly reduced mortality [11,12]. this
may be related to the cardiovascular protection resulting from these
drugs [9,10], but other mechanisms may be involved. for example, the
ace inhibitor captopril inhibits  xxxg1428xxx  activity in extracts from the rat
kidney [13]. however, the reasons why ace inhibitors inhibit  xxxg1428xxx 
activity remain unclear, and it has not been clariﬁed whether ace
inhibitors attenuate  xxxg1428xxx  activity in peritoneal efﬂuent.
considering the enzyme from molecular structure, the active site
of  xxxg1428xxx  is reported to contain an active center zn2+ ion chelated
with three histidine residues (his201, his205, his211) [14]. substrate
binding sites in  xxxg1428xxx  have been characterized by the deep p1′ hole
and its entrance, consisting of leu197, val198, his201, pro221, ile222
and tyr223. the active form of  xxxg1428xxx  also has a widely exposed
hydrophobic site (tyr155, his166, phe168), which would be
encrypted by the pre-peptide in the  xxxg1428xxx  precursor. on the other
hand, a typical ace inhibitor, captopril, had a –sh group and it was
found to chelate the zn active center of ace in some x-ray
structures [15,16]. ace has the similar active center and different
substrate speciﬁcity compared with  xxxg1428xxx .

capd ﬂuid contained 1.35–2.5% glucose.  xxxg1428xxx  activity was assayed
using an  xxxg1428xxx  activity assay system (amersham biosciences co,
piscataway, nj). to conﬁrm the inhibitory effects of ace and  xxxg1428xxx 
activities in peritoneal efﬂuents, samples were incubated with captopril
for 1 h at 37 °c.

2. materials and methods
2.1. inhibitory effects of  xxxg1428xxx  activity by captopril
peritoneal efﬂuent drained at 4 h after injection of commercial
peritoneal dialysis solution was obtained from 17 patients (male, 64.7%;
etiology of renal failure: diabetes, 23.5%) with a mean age of 54.8 years
who had undergone capd for a mean duration of 59.5 months. the

a

a molecular structure of the human  xxxg1428xxx  active domain was
prepared from coordinate sets of 1qib [14] in the protein data bank
(pdb), including ca2+ and zn2+ ions and crystal water molecules. to
create the initial models for the complex with a captopril molecule,
several orientations for the inhibitor were considered; we applied
1000 iterations of random docking, using a package for molecular
structure analyses, moe (molecular operating environment, chemical
computing group inc., québec, canada http://www.chemcomp.com/
). these iterations were performed with a distance restraint between
the captopril sulfur atom and the zn2+ ion of the  xxxg1428xxx  active center
similar to that in the x-ray structure of the ace–captopril complex
(pdb code: 1uzf) [15]. each model during the simulations was
optimized by energy minimization as described in our previous
analyses [17–19].

3. results and discussion
the inhibitory effect of captopril on  xxxg1428xxx  activity was measured
in peritoneal efﬂuents from patients on capd. the dose–response
curve is shown in fig. 1.  xxxg1428xxx  concentration was 231 ± 15.2 ng/ml
in the peritoneal efﬂuents obtained from 17 patients. captopril
inhibited  xxxg1428xxx  activity in a dose-dependent manner at doses from 1
to 100 µmol/l (ic50; 48 µmol/l). this result clearly shows that
captopril directly inhibit  xxxg1428xxx  activity in peritoneal efﬂuents from
patients on capd. on the other hand, the angiotensin-ii receptor
blockers (arbs)  xxxd3487xxx  and exp3174 (an active metabolite of
losaratan) did not inﬂuence  xxxg1428xxx  activity, even  xxxd1891xxx  mmol/l in this
assay system (data not shown). thus, this inhibitory activity of
captopril may not be related to angiotensin-ii, an ace product.
furthermore, we constructed molecular models of the  xxxg1428xxx –
captopril complex. the chemical structure of captopril and three
typical binding structures are shown in fig. 2. these binding structures
supported the notion that –sh group of captopril can chelate directly
to the zn active center of  xxxg1428xxx  without molecular distortions, but
the ﬂexibility of the binding mode was signiﬁcant due to the compact
structure of captopril.
the most stable structure during above docking simulations had a
hydrogen bond between the central carbonyl group of captopril and
the main chain of leu164, and hydrophobic interactions between the
captopril pyrrolidine ring and the side chains of leu163 and leu164,
as shown by the light green structure in fig. 2b. the terminal carboxyl
group of captopril, which interacted with the s2′ positive charge in
ace [15,16], is not essential for binding with  xxxg1428xxx . these models
were similar to the captopril binding mode to the active site of  xxxg1440xxx 
in our previous studies [17,20].
ace inhibitors, such as captopril, target ace, but  xxxg1428xxx  is also
inhibited by captopril. however  xxxg1428xxx  inhibitors have been
developed to directly target the  xxxg1428xxx  active site, especially the
deep p1′ hole [21]. the present ﬁndings show that ace inhibitors are
also lead compounds in  xxxg1428xxx  inhibition. furthermore, it was
suggested by above molecular models that the mechanism of
inhibition could be direct binding to the active center by a chelate
bond, but the inhibitory interaction of captopril with the  xxxg1428xxx 
substrate binding site would not be tight and complicated, considering
the molecular ﬂexibility on the active site. to increase the inhibitory
speciﬁcity to  xxxg1428xxx , similar investigations using other ace inhibitors
may be also necessary.
the direct inhibitory effects of ace inhibitors against  xxxg1428xxx  activity
may contribute clinically by suppressing inﬂammation in eps during
capd therapy. on the other hand, ace inhibitors or arbs may protect
peritoneal membrane function [22]. therefore, ace inhibitors and arbs
may inhibit  xxxg1428xxx  activity in vivo. for example, angiotensin-ii induces
 xxxg1428xxx  gene expression in monocytes, and  xxxg1428xxx  expression in
atherosclerotic regions from patients treated with the arb irbesartan
was signiﬁcantly lower when compared with that in patients treated
with the diuretic  xxxd1680xxx  [23]. in this study, there were some
patients treated with ace inhibitors and arbs, and these may have
affected  xxxg1428xxx  activity in the peritoneal efﬂuent from patients on
capd. however, the present was a small-scale study, and it is unclear
whether ace inhibitors and arbs inﬂuence  xxxg1428xxx  activity. further
study is needed in order to clarify the interaction between the blockade
of angiotensin-ii function and  xxxg1428xxx  inhibition in vivo.

in the present study, we showed the direct inhibitory effect of
captopril against  xxxg1428xxx  activity in peritoneal efﬂuents from patients
on capd and clariﬁed its mechanism. therefore, an ace inhibitor may
be useful for the protection of peritoneal membrane function in longterm patients on capd.
