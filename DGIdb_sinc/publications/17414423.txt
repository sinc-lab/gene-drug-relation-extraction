abstract—we have previously shown that administration of glucosamine after trauma-hemorrhage (th) improved cardiac
output and organ perfusion, and this was associated with increased levels of o-linked n- xxxd2683xxx  (o-glcnac)
on proteins in the heart and brain. an alternative means of increasing o-glcnac levels is by inhibition of o-linked
n-acetylglucosaminidase, which catalyzes the removal of n- xxxd2683xxx  from proteins, with o-(2-acetamido-2deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene) amino-n-phenylcarbamate (pugnac). the goal of this study, therefore, was to determine
whether pugnac administration after th also improves recovery of organ perfusion and function. fasted male rats were
bled to and maintained at a mean arterial blood pressure of 40 mmhg for 90 min, followed by fluid resuscitation.
intravenous administration of pugnac (200 2mol/kg body weight) 30 min after the onset of resuscitation significantly
improved cardiac output compared with the vehicle controls (12.3 t 1.3 ml/min per 100 g body weight vs. 25.5 t 2.0 ml/min
per 100 g body weight; p g 0.05), decreased total peripheral resistance (6.6 t 0.8 mmhg/ml per minute per 100 g body
weight vs. 3.7 t 0.3 mmhg/ml per minute per 100 g body weight; p g 0.05), and increased perfusion of critical organ
systems, including the kidney and liver, determined at 2 h after the end of resuscitation. treatment with pugnac also
attenuated the th-induced increase in plasma il-6 levels (864 t 112 pg/ml vs. 392 t 188 pg/ml; p g 0.05) and tnf-!
levels (216 t 21 pg/ml vs. 94 t 11 pg/ml; p g 0.05) and significantly increased o-glcnac levels in the heart, liver, and
kidney. thus, pugnac, like glucosamine, improves cardiac function and organ perfusion and reduced the level of
circulating il-6 and tnf-! after th. the similar effects of glucosamine and pugnac support the notion that the protection
associated with both interventions is mediated via increased protein o-glcnac levels.

introduction

stress-activated pathway. we have also shown that glucosamine treatment protected the isolated perfused heart from
ischemic injury, and this seemed to be mediated via an increase
in o-glcnac levels (14). the precise mechanisms underlying
the protection associated with increased o-glcnac have yet to
be determined; however, o-glcnac modification of proteins
has been shown to play an important role in transcription,
translation, nuclear transport, and cytoskeletal assembly (11,
12). also, it has been proposed that the protection associated
with increased o-glcnac levels could be mediated, at least
in part, by increased heat shock protein (hsp) 70 expression
(13). kneass and marchase (15, 16) have also shown that
acute increases in o-glcnac levels in isolated human neutrophils significantly altered their response to agonist stimulation, which could have important implications for protection
against th.
in the light of the fact that glucosamine improved recovery
after th and increased tissue o-glcnac levels, we postulated
that the protection might be a direct consequence of the
increase in o-glcnac. the o-glcnac transferase (uridine
diphospho-n- xxxd2683xxx  [ xxxd1482xxx ]: polypeptide
"-n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase [ogt]) is responsible for
catalyzing the addition of o-glcnac to serine or threonine
residues of target proteins (11, 12). a direct test of the
hypothesis that the protection seen with glucosamine is
mediated via this pathway would be to demonstrate that
inhibition of ogt abrogated the protection. however, there
are no commercially available specific high-affinity inhibitors

trauma-hemorrhagic shock causes a life-threatening syndrome
including sepsis, organ dysfunction, and, eventually, organ failure
(1y4). previous studies have shown prolonged depression of
cardiovascular function, organ perfusion, and immune functions
in male rodents after trauma-hemorrhagic shock, despite fluid
resuscitation (5y9). we recently reported that administration of
glucosamine during resuscitation, after trauma-hemorrhage
(th), improved cardiac output (co) and organ perfusion and
attenuated serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines tnf! and il-6 (10). glucosamine treatment was also associated
with increased levels of o-linked n- xxxd2683xxx 
(o-glcnac) modifications of proteins in the heart and brain.
the o-glcnac modification of proteins occurs on serine
and threonine residues in a manner similar to protein
phosphorylation; indeed, many phosphorylation sites are also
known as glycosylation sites (11, 12). zachara et al. (13)
recently demonstrated that increased levels of o-glcnac were
cytoprotective and proposed that this was an endogenous

of ogt, and ablation of the ogt gene is embryonically lethal
(17). an alternative approach would be to determine whether
increasing o-glcnac levels independent of glucosamine also
improved recovery from th. the removal of o-glcnac from
proteins is catalyzed by o-linked n-acetylglucosaminidase
( xxxg1403xxx ) (11, 12), and inhibition of this enzyme with
o-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene) amino-nphenylcarbamate (pugnac) prevents cycling of o-glcnac
on proteins, leading to globally elevated levels of this
modification in cell cultures (16, 18). however, to our
knowledge, no studies to date have shown whether pugnac
administration in vivo increases tissue levels of o-glcnac.
therefore, the goal of this study was to determine whether
in vivo administration of pugnac after th increases tissue
o-glcnac levels and, if so, whether this is associated with
improved recovery of organ perfusion and function.

materials and methods
animals
male adult sprague-dawley rats (300 t 25 g) were used in all the studies. all
animal experiments were approved by the university of alabama institutional
animal care and use committee and conformed to the guide for the care and
use of laboratory animals published by the national institutes of health (nih
publication no. 85y23, 1996).

experimental design
to determine whether in vivo administration of pugnac in rats would increase
tissue o-glcnac levels, 300 2l of a 20-mmol/l freshly prepared stock solution of
pugnac (~200 2mol/kg body weight) diluted in 2.5 ml of isotonic  xxxd3213xxx 
solution was administered as a bolus via the femoral vein; animals were killed, and
tissues were harvested 2.5 h later. levels of o-glcnac in the heart were assessed in
control and pugnac-treated animals via western blot analysis, as described below.
in subsequent experiments, animals were randomly divided into three
groups: sham and th treated with either vehicle (isotonic  xxxd3213xxx 
solution) or pugnac (toronto research chemicals inc, north york, canada)
dissolved in isotonic  xxxd3213xxx . the total dose of pugnac used
was the same as that used in preliminary experiments, namely, approximately
200 2mol/kg body weight, and was administered in a total volume of 2.5 ml
starting 30 min after the onset of resuscitation through femoral venous catheter.
the vehicle-treated group received the same volume of 0.9%  xxxd3213xxx  for
the same period. two hours after sham operation or th and resuscitation, cardiac
function and organ blood flow were determined; blood samples were collected for
measurement of plasma tnf-! and il-6, and tissues were harvested for assessment
of o-glcnac levels, as described below.

2 h. sham-operated animals were made to undergo the same surgical procedure
but were neither bled nor resuscitated.

determination of cardiac function and organ blood flow
two hours after the end of resuscitation or sham operation, the animals were
anesthetized with ketamine hydrogen chloride (100 mg/kg body weight; phoenix
scientific, inc, st joseph, mo). the right femoral artery and vein were
recannulated. the right carotid artery was also cannulated and connected to a
pressure transducer to monitor and record map and hr. the catheter was then
advanced into the left ventricle, and the positive and negative first derivatives of
pressure (+/jdp/dt) were recorded by a heart performance analyzer (hpa,  xxxd1884xxx ). the position of the catheter tip in the left ventricle was confirmed by means
of the characteristic left ventricular pressure dynamics.
the co and organ blood flow were determined using a radioactive microsphere
technique. strontium-85ylabeled microspheres (dupont nen, boston, mass) were
suspended in 10% dextran containing 0.01% polysorbate 80 (tween 80; sigmaaldrich, st louis, mo) to prevent aggregation. a 0.2- to 0.25-ml suspension of
microspheres with an activity of approximately 2 to 2.5 2ci (500,000 cpm) was
injected manually into the left ventricle in each rat via the left ventricular catheter
for 40 s at a constant rate. the reference blood sample was withdrawn from the
femoral arterial catheter into a 3-ml syringe, beginning 20 s before microspheres
injection and continuing for an additional 20 s at a rate of 0.7 ml/min, with a pump
(harvard apparatus, holliston, mass). isotonic  xxxd3213xxx  was
infused manually at the rate of 0.7 ml/min immediately after microspheres
infusion to replace the volume of blood lost. the rat was then killed with
intravenous injection of saturated  xxxd2988xxx . various organs were
harvested, weighed, and placed in one or more test tubes; organ radioactivity was
then counted with an automatic gamma counter (1470 wizard; wallac, gaithersburg, md). the reference blood sample was transferred from a syringe into a test
tube for radioactivity measurement. the remaining microspheres, which were left
in the syringe and needle after injection, were also counted. the co and organ
blood flow were calculated according to the following equations:
cardiac output ¼ ½ðrbf  ctþ=ðcr  bwþ  1=100
organ blood flow¼ ½ðrbf  ct þ=cr   1=100:
where rbf is the reference blood sample withdrawal rate (0.7 ml/min), and bw
is body weight. ct is counts per minute of total injected dose; ct is counts per minute
per gram of tissue, and cr is counts per minute in the reference blood sample.
stroke volume (sv), total peripheral resistance (tpr), and systemic oxygen
delivery (do2) and consumption (v̇o2) were calculated according to standard
equations, as previously described by yang et al. (20).

measurement of plasma tnf-! and il-6 levels
blood samples (1 ml) were collected in edta-coated test tubes at 2 h after th
and resuscitation or sham operation just before injection of microspheres. plasma
was immediately separated by centrifugation, and plasma samples were stored at
j80-c until assayed for plasma tnf-! and il-6. systemic tnf-! and il-6 levels
were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (r&d systems,
minneapolis, minn) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

o-glcnac protein levels
trauma-hemorrhagic shock model
trauma-hemorrhagic shock was induced in fasted animals, as previously
described (5, 10). animals were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane (minrad inc,
bethlehem, pa) inhalation, and a 5-cm ventral midline laparotomy was performed
to induce trauma before hemorrhage. the abdominal incision was closed in two
layers. both femoral artery and right vein were cannulated with polyethylene 50
tubing. the right femoral artery was connected to a blood pressure analyzer
(digi-med, louisville, ky) for the measurement and monitoring of map and
heart rate (hr). the right vein was used for fluid resuscitation, and the left artery
was used for bleeding. all the cannulated animals were allowed to wake up from
anesthesia, and the blood withdrawn was performed under conscious conditions.
the total blood volume was calculated (total blood volume = body weight  6%)
(19). the animals were quickly bled to map of 35 to 40 mmhg within 10 min.
the map was maintained at 35 to 40 mmhg by removing more blood until the
animals were no longer able to maintain blood pressure at that level (i.e.,
maximal bleed-out volume); typically, this was achieved by withdrawal of
approximately 60% of the total circulating blood volume in 45 t 10 min. at that
point, map was maintained by giving fluid in the form of ringer’s lactate
intravenously until 40% of the shed blood volume was returned; this period lasted
for 45 min (shock stage). thereafter, the animals were resuscitated with ringer’s
lactate solution, four times the removed blood volume at a constant rate during
the next 60 min. at the end of resuscitation, all cannulations were removed;
vessels were ligated, and the animals were returned to the cages to recover for

as previously described (10, 14), tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer
(tris, 50 mmol/l;  xxxd3213xxx , 150 mmol/l; edta, 1 mmol/l; 1%
 xxxd1835xxx ; 1% np-40; and 10% sodium  xxxd3215xxx  [sds]) centrifuged at
14,000g for 10 min at 4-c, and the supernatant was stored at j80-c until used.
the lysate was then diluted in 6 sample buffer (0.5 mol/l trisyhydrogen
chloride, 10% sds, 30% glycerol, 0.2%  xxxd26xxx , and 0.012%
bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. fifty micrograms of protein per lane
was separated by sdsypolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to
immobilon-p transfer membranes. immunoblotting was performed using a rapid
immunodetection method for immobilon-p. briefly, the membranes were equilibrated in methanol and air dried. the dried membrane was incubated with a
1:5,000 dilution of antiyo-glcnac antibody ctd110.6 in 1% casein/phosphatebuffered saline (pbs; pierce chemical co, rockford, ill) with 0.01% tween 20 for
2 h and then washed three times in pbs. the membrane was then incubated with a
1:10,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidaseyconjugated goat antimouse immunoglobulin m (calbiochem, darmstadt, germany) in 1% casein/pbs with 0.01%
tween 20 for 1 h. after further washing in pbs, the immunoblots were developed
with enhanced chemiluminescence (supersignal west pico; pierce chemical co).

statistical analysis
data were presented as means t se of eight animals in each group.
comparisons were performed with one-way anova and student-newman-keuls.
statistically significant differences among groups were defined as p g 0.05.

results

in vivo administration of pugnac increases cardiac
o-glcnac levels

the results from experiments showing the effect of in vivo
pugnac administration on o-glcnac levels are summarized
in figure 1. equal protein loading of the gel was confirmed
with sypro ruby protein blot stain (bio-rad laboratories,
hercules, calif) staining (fig. 1a). similar to previous reports
in cell culture (16, 18), we found that 2 h after treatment with
200 2mol/kg body weight of pugnac, overall o-glcnac
levels in the heart were increased approximately two fold.
effect of pugnac on cardiac function after th and
resuscitation

as shown in table 1, the total bleed-out volume was similar
in both vehicle and pugnac-treated groups; in both groups,
there were significant decreases in hemoglobin level and
percent hematocrit after th compared with the sham groups.
in the vehicle-treated group, hr and map were significantly
decreased after th and resuscitation compared with shamoperated rats. the pugnac treatment significantly increased
map compared with the vehicle-treated group; however, hr
was unaffected. consistent with our previous studies using
this model (10), do2 and v̇o2 were both significantly
decreased in vehicle-treated group, and oxygen extraction
ratio and plasma lactate levels were significantly increased.
treatment with pugnac significantly increased do2 and

effect of pugnac on plasma tnf-! and il-6 levels

both plasma levels of tnf-! and il-6 increased significantly at 2 h after th (fig. 4, ayb). the pugnac treatment
significantly attenuated the th-induced tnf-! and il-6 (p g
0.05; fig. 4, ayb).
effect of pugnac on tissue o-glcnac levels

in rats subjected to th, o-glcnac levels were significantly
decreased in the heart, liver, and kidney compared with sham
group (fig. 5). however, in the pugnac-treated group, the
o-glcnac levels were significantly increased in the heart,
liver, and kidney compared with the vehicle-treated group
(fig. 5). the o-glcnac levels in the brain were not affected
by th or pugnac treatment (fig. 5).

after th, rats treated with vehicle exhibited significantly
decreased co and sv compared with sham-operated rats (p g
0.05; fig. 2, ayb); however, tpr was significantly increased
(p g 0.05; fig. 2c). in the pugnac-treated group, co and
sv were significantly increased, and tpr was decreased
compared with vehicle-treated group (p g 0.05; fig. 2, ayc).
moreover, pugnac treatment maintained co, sv, and
tpr at the levels similar to those in sham-operated animal.
in addition, +dp/dt and jdp/dt were significantly depressed
in the vehicle-treated th group compared with sham group,
and pugnac treatment significantly increased both
+dp/dt and jdp/dt by 34% and 39%, respectively (p g
0.05; fig. 2, dye).
effects of pugnac on organ blood flow

as previously reported, there were no significant differences between any of the groups in heart or brain blood flow
following th (10) (fig. 3, ayb). in both liver and kidney,
blood flow was decreased significantly after th in the
vehicle-treated group compared with sham group, and treatment with pugnac significantly improved blood flow in
these organs (fig. 3, cyd). in table 2, blood flow measured
in other organs is summarized. in most cases, blood flow was
markedly reduced after th and resuscitation; however,
although organ blood flow, in general, was higher in the
pugnac-treated group, with the exception of the large
intestine, this did not reach statistical significance.
to determine whether pugnac had any direct effect on
blood flow or cardiac function, four sham-operated animals
were treated with pugnacvwith a dose same as the one used
during resuscitation after th. cardiac function and blood flow
were measured 2 h after treatment. there were no significant
differences in any of the parameters measured between sham
groups with or without pugnac treatment (data not shown).

we have previously reported that glucosamine treatment
during resuscitation significantly improved cardiac function
and organ perfusion after th (10), which was associated with
an increase in the protein o-glcnac levels in the heart. in the
light of recent studies suggesting that elevated o-glcnac
levels are an endogenous stress-activated mechanism (13), we
postulated that this same mechanism might also contribute to
the protection seen with glucosamine treatment. we show
here for the first time that in vivo administration of pugnac,
an  xxxg1403xxx  inhibitor, significantly increases tissue levels
of o-glcnac and that, after th, pugnac treatment during
resuscitation significantly improves cardiac function and
perfusion of critical organ systems and reduced plasma levels
of inflammatory cytokines. these data strongly support the
notion that protection previously reported with glucosamine is
mediated via increased o-glcnac levels. furthermore, this
study also suggests that pharmacological approaches designed
to increase o-glcnac levels, independent of the hexosamine
biosynthesis pathway (hbp), may represent new therapeutic
targets for the treatment of trauma-hemorrhagic shock.

hexokinase and subsequently metabolized via the hbp, thereby
increasing  xxxd1482xxx  levels. in addition to being the
essential sugar donor for the formation of o-glcnac catalyzed by ogt,  xxxd1482xxx  is also a substrate for multiple
n-glycosylation reactions. glucosamine-6-phosphate also
could be metabolized to fructose-6-phosphate via glucosamine6-phosphate isomerase or deaminase, thereby increasing
glycolytic flux. consequently, there are a number of potential
mechanisms, in addition to increased o-glcnac levels, which
could contribute to glucosamine-mediated protection after th
(10). in the isolated perfused heart, we showed that alloxan, a
putative inhibitor of ogt, abrogated glucosamine-mediated
ischemic protection and also prevented the increase in oglcnac. however, the required high concentration (5 mmol/l)
of alloxan and the potential for nonspecific effects precludes
the use of this approach in vivo. in cell culture studies, it has
been shown that reduction of ogt expression decreases
tolerance of cells to stress (13); however, in vivo gene deletion
is embryonically lethal (17). thus, this approach cannot be
used here to demonstrate more definitively that glucosamineinduced protection is mediated via increased flux through
ogt and elevated o-glcnac levels. however, in cell culture
studies, inhibition of  xxxg1403xxx  with pugnac prevents
removal of o-glcnac from proteins, thereby increasing
overall o-glcnac levels without any change in  xxxd1482xxx 
concentration (21), and increases tolerance of cells to stress
(13, 22). our results here extend these in vitro studies to
demonstrate that pugnac is effective in increasing oglcnac levels in vivo in rats and that this is associated with
improved recovery of organ function after th. it is also
noteworthy that this occurred when treatment was administered during the resuscitation phase, demonstrating that
pretreatment is not required for improved outcome.
the mechanisms by which increased o-glcnac levels are
protective and increase cell function have yet to be determined. the expression of hsp-70 and hsp-40 has been
shown to be induced more rapidly in the presence of increased
o-glcnac; conversely, hsp expression decreased when ogt
expression is reduced (13). interestingly, hsp-70 has been
reported to bind to o-glcnac residues and be directly
modified by o-glcnac. certain hsps seem to have lectinic
activity toward o-glcnac, suggesting a further role of oglcnac in stress (14). thus, one potential role in stress

zou

et al.

protection by o-glcnac is through the induction and
increased stability of hsps. calcium overload is also an
important mediator of cellular injury after ischemia/reperfusion. we have shown that increased hbp flux and o-glcnac
levels decreased calcium influx into cardiomyocytes (22).
furthermore, glucosamine protected the isolated perfused rat
heart from calcium overload stress induced by the calcium
paradox (22). thus, a reduction in calcium overload as a result
of increased o-glcnac levels may also contribute to the
protection seen here.
we have shown here that increasing o-glcnac levels with
pugnac during resuscitation after th resulted in a reduction
in the circulating levels of tnf-! and il-6 (fig. 4) similar to
those seen with glucosamine treatment (10). it has been
reported that depressed cardiac function after th may be

caused, at least in part, by increased il-6 and tnf-!
production (7, 23, 24). thus, the reduction in circulating
cytokines after pugnac treatment could contribute to the
improved cardiac function and organ blood flow. however, it
is also possible that pugnac directly improves co, thereby
preserving organ blood flow, which leads to lower inflammatory cytokine production. the tnf-!yinduced activation of
nuclear factor .b is widely recognized as playing a critical
role in the stress-induced inflammatory response including  xxxg1181xxx  production (7, 24y27). it is intriguing to note that changes in
cytosolic calcium have been shown to play a role in mediating
the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor .b, possibly via
activation of calcineurin (28, 29). we have previously shown
that glucosamine blocks nuclear translocation of nuclear
factor of activated t cells, which is also mediated via calcium
activation of calcineurin, by decreasing calcium influx via
capacitative calcium entry (cce) pathway (30, 31). cce, also
known as store-operated calcium entry, is known to be
essential for normal immune response. it is possible, therefore, that the attenuation of the inflammatory response to th
seen with both pugnac and glucosamine could be caused by
the inhibition of cce/store-operated calcium entry in immune
system cells. clearly, further studies are required to determine
the mechanisms underlying the effect of increased o-glcnac
levels on inflammatory cytokine response.
sex hormones are known to modulate immune function
under normal and stress conditions (32); of particular relevance here, 17"-estradiol has been shown to be protective
after adverse circulatory conditions such as th (2, 33). it has
been reported that estrogen receptors ! and " are modified by
o-glcnac (34y36), and it has been proposed that the
increased levels of o-glcnac could block protein degradation. this raises the intriguing possibility that the protection
associated with increased o-glcnac levels could be mediated
via an estrogen receptorydependent mechanism. it is also
worth noting that glutamine has been shown to improve
outcome after critical illness including after injury and surgery
(37, 38), and it has been suggested that this might be mediated
via increased induction of hsp-70 (38, 39). zachara et al. (13)
found that cellular protection induced by increased o-glcnac
levels was also associated with increased hsp-70 expression.
glutamine is the essential amino donor for the formation of
glucosamine-6-phosphate catalyzed by glutamine: fructose-6phosphate amidotransferase; increasing glutamine concentrations has been shown to increase  xxxd1482xxx  levels (40).
furthermore, we have recently shown that, in the isolated
perfused heart, ischemic protection induced by glutamine was
mediated via increased o-glcnac levels (41). this raises the
distinct possibility that protection associated with glutamine
in vivo may also be mediated, at least in part, via activation of
the hbp and increased o-glcnac levels.
in conclusion, we have shown that, in a rodent model of
th, administration of the  xxxg1403xxx  inhibitor, pugnac,
during resuscitation reduces the severity of the shock-induced
alterations and improves cardiac function and organ perfusion
and decreases circulatory inflammatory cytokines. this
improvement in the recovery of organ functions is associated
with increased protein o-glcnacylation in the heart, liver,

pugnac treatment after trauma-hemorrhage

and kidney. these results are remarkably similar to those seen
with glucosamine treatment, which also increased tissue levels
of o-glcnac (10). these results provide further support
for the notion that pathways leading to the formation of
o-glcnac are endogenous stress-activated pathways and that
augmentation of this response, either by increasing the
synthesis or by inhibiting the degradation of o-glcnac,
may represent novel strategies for protection against injury
resulting from th.
