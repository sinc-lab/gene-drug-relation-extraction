abstract
troglitazone and  xxxd3147xxx  e ( xxxd3147xxx ), members of the thiazolidinedione (tzd) class of antidiabetic
drugs, are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g (ppar g ) ligands that induce adipocyte differentiation and increase the expression of ppar g protein. here, we report the characterization of a ppar g specific
monoclonal antibody (mab), p g a53.25, and its use to monitor ppar g expression in the noncom mitted pluripotent murine mesenchymal stem cell line, c3h10t1/2, treated with tzds. mab p g a53.25 was raised against
a region in the n-terminal domain of human ppar g shared by splice variants ppar g 1 and ppar g 2. it recognizes immunizing antigen in enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (elisa), and does not cross-react with
the n-terminal domains of ppar a or ppar d . in western blotting, p g a53.25 reacts with the immunizing antigen as well as distinct protein bands corresponding to the molecular weight of full length ppar g from
c3h10t1/2 cells and rat tissue lysates. in fluorescent microscopy, p g a53.25 immunostains nuclei of
c3h10t1/2 cells treated with ppar g ligands. the fluorescence intensity of the treated cells is tzd dose-dependent, and correlates with lipid accumulation consistent with adipogenesis. based on these results, we propose that mab p g a53.25 will be a useful tool for elucidating the role of ppar g in fatty acid metabolism and
adipocyte differentiation.

(ppars) represent a family of ligand-activated transcription factors which bind as heterodimers with the retinoid x receptor (rxr) to specific dna response elements (ppres) in
the regulatory regions of target genes, altering their rates of
transcription. to date, three ppar subtypes have been identified  xxxg1805xxx  ,  xxxg1806xxx  and  xxxg1807xxx  .(1–4) their known target genes
encode proteins regulating lipid homeostasis. (5–6) the  xxxg1805xxx 
subtype is expressed at high levels in the liver where it plays a
role in the catabolism of  xxxd2154xxx . (1,7–9)  xxxg1806xxx  is expressed
ubiquitously and its function is yet to be defined.  xxxg1807xxx  expression is greatest in adipose tissue where it has been implicated in the control of genes involved in adipocyte differentiation and fatty acid synthesis. (10,11) retroviral expression of
 xxxg1807xxx  strongly induces adipogenesis (12) and  xxxg1807xxx  ligands
can stimulate several fibroblast and muscle cell lines to differhe

entiate into adipocytes. (11,13) recent reports of  xxxg1807xxx  expression in intestine and in human atherosclerotic plaques have suggested additional roles for the receptor. activation of  xxxg1807xxx  ,
either by ligands or high fat diets, results in colon carcinogenesis in mice. (14–16 ) in cultured human monocyte-derive d
macrophages,  xxxg1807xxx  activation regulates the expression and
activity of matrix metalloproteinas es thought to be involved in
plaque rupture. (17)
there are two  xxxg1807xxx  splice variants,  xxxg1807xxx  1 and  xxxg1807xxx  2,
derived from alternative promoters on the same gene in mouse
and human. (2,9,18)  xxxg1807xxx  2 contains 30 additional amino acids
at the nh 2 terminus. both  xxxg1807xxx  forms heterodimerize with
rxr a and migrate to the nucleus upon ligand binding. (1,9,18)
to characterize the function of  xxxg1807xxx  protein in adipogenesis
and colon carcinogenesis, it is useful to have a  xxxg1807xxx  subtype-specific antibody. generation of such a tool has been difficult due to the high degree of sequence similarity between the
various ppar subtypes.

here we describe a  xxxg1807xxx  mab, pg a53.25, that was raised
against a recombinant protein comprising the n-terminal region
of human  xxxg1807xxx  , the least conserved region among ppar subtypes. this region is common to  xxxg1807xxx  1 and ppar g 2, and
does not include the highly conserved ligand binding domain
and known phosphorylation sites. it has , 10% amino acid homology to n-terminal regions of hum an  xxxg1805xxx  and  xxxg1806xxx  ,
whereas the homology between rodent and human  xxxg1807xxx  in
this region is 95%. this antibody will be useful for detecting
all forms of  xxxg1807xxx  , without cross-reacting with the other
ppar family members.

materials and methods
antigen preparation
the amino terminal region of the human  xxxg1807xxx  , residues
2–110, was fused downstream of an 11-residue histidine tag and
was overproduced in e. coli bl21(de3) bacteria using the t7 expression system (invitrogen, san diego, ca). the transformed
bacteria cells were grown in standard lb media at 25°c and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-b-d-thiogalactopyranoside (iptg)
for 1 h. the cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer consisting
of 50 mm hepes ph 7.5, 25 mm imidazole ph 7.5, and 250
mm nacl at 4°c. the cellular suspension was sonicated and the
recombinant protein was purified as previously described. (19)

immunization and fusion
a 7-week-old fem ale balb/c mouse was immunized with
10 m g of antigen emulsified in ribi adjuvant (ribi, hamil-

ton, mt) intraperitoneal ly on day 0, and 5 m g on days 14. on
days 21 and 24, the mouse was given an intravenous (i.v.) injection of 5 m g of antigen in saline. twenty-four hours after
the second i.v. injection, the mouse was sacrificed, spleen asceptically rem oved, and splenocytes prepared for fusion as previously described. (20) briefly, 4.6 3 10 7 spleen cells (1/2
of spleen capsule) and 3 3 10 7 mouse myelom a cells
p3x63bcl2-13 (21) were fused using  xxxd2982xxx  1500
(boehringer mannheim , germany). fused cells were resuspended at 1 3 10 6 cells/ml in hybridom a growth media that
is composed of equal volume of rpmi 1640 (life technologies, inc., gaithersburg , md) and excell-610 (jrh biosciences, lenexa, ks) supplemente d with 10% fetal bovine
serum (hyclone, logan, ut), 1 x origen hybridoma cloning
factor (igen, gaithersburg , md), 2 mm glutamine, and penicillin/streptom ycin. cells were then plated in three 24-w ell microtiter plates (costar, cambridge, ma) at 1 ml/well. twentyfour hours later, 1 ml of 23 hat-selection media; 100 m m
hypoxanthine, 0.4 m m aminopterin, 16 m m thymine (life
technologies , inc.) in hybridoma grow th media was added to
each well. after 2 weeks of culture at 37°c, 5% co 2 , hybridoma supernatants were screened for specific antibodies by
enzyme-linke d immunoadsorbent assay (elisa) and western
blotting. limiting dilution cloning was performed on selected
hybridomas.

elisa
ninety-six-w ell immunoplates were coated overnight at 4°c
with 50 m l of recombinant proteins at 2 m g/ml in 0.1m sodium
bicarbonate buffer, ph 9.6. after plates were washed in tbst
(50 mm tris, 150 mm nacl, 0.05% tween 20, ph 8.0), all
procedures were carried out at room temperature. following incubation of immunoplates with blocking buffer (5% normal
goat serum, 1 mg/ml of  xxxd2982xxx  2000 and 0.05%
tween 20 in tbs) for 1 h, hybridoma supernatants or purified
antibody (0.01–1 m g/ml) were added to the wells for 1 h incubation. plates were then washed three times with tbst, and
goat anti-mouse igg conjugated with alkaline phosphatase
(southern biotechnology, birmingham , al) diluted 1/1000 in
blocking buffer was added for a 1 h incubation. after plates
were washed as above, alkaline phosphatase substrate ( xxxd2822xxx , sigma, st. louis, mo) was added. immunoreactivity was recorded follow ing color development, as
measured at 405 nm in a microplate reader (uv max™ , molecular devices, menlo park, ca).
immunoglobul in classes and subclasses were determ ined using a elisa subtyping kits (southern biotechnology) follow ing the manufacturer’ s instructions.

c3h10t1/2 clone 8 murine fibroblasts (american type culture collection, ccl-226) below passage 22 were maintained in
dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (life technologies, inc.)
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (fcs), 100 u/ml  xxxd2871xxx  and 100 m g/ml streptomycin. one day after passage into
96-well microtiter plates (12.5 3 103 cells/cm 2 ) for total triglyceride determinations or 6-well plates for western lysates, cells
were treated with  xxxg1807xxx  agonist (5 m m troglitazone or 1 m m
rosiglitazone) plus 1 m m insulin and 1 m m 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx 
(sigma, st. louis, mo). after 7 days, cells in 96-well plates were

results
members of the ppar  xxxg1594xxx  superfamily share many regions of amino acid homology and consequently, generating a subtype-specific, cross-species antibody
is an arduous task. we drew on our previous experience with

ppar gamma-specific monoclonal antibodies
the selection of immunizing antigen for the development of
 xxxg1805xxx  -specific mabs (19) by using the n-term inal domain of
the  xxxg1807xxx  protein, which is the least conserved region among
ppar subtypes with , 15% amino acid hom ology. a histidinetagged protein com prised of the n-terminal 2–110 amino acids
com mon to human  xxxg1807xxx  1 and  xxxg1807xxx  2 was expressed in e.
coli, purified, and used throughout the entire immunization protocol. seventy-two hybridom a wells were plated from a somatic
fusion of myelom a cells with splenocytes harvested from an
immunized mouse. supernatants from twenty six of the hybridoma wells were positive against the immunizing antigen in
elisa, but only three wells also recognized the immunizing
antigen in western. limiting dilution cloning of p g a53, one of
the elisa-positive and western-reactive hybridomas, resulted
in 46 monoclonal hybridomas. clone p g a53.25, which secretes
immunoglobulin igg1, was selected based on its immunoreactivity in various screening assays.
figure 1 shows that pg a53.25 exhibited specific and antibody dose-dependent reactivity against the immunogen by
elisa analysis. there was no cross-reactivity against the n-terminal domains of  xxxg1805xxx  or  xxxg1806xxx  proteins, nor against bsa.
using a biacore system, we determined that the affinity of
p g a53.25 to the n-terminal  xxxg1807xxx  protein was 2 3 102 7 m.(20)
figure 2a shows that p g a53.25 recognized  xxxg1807xxx  n-terminal protein in a concentration-depe ndent manner by western

277

blotting, and did not cross-react with up to 250 ng of  xxxg1805xxx 
or  xxxg1806xxx  n-terminal proteins. the western blot illustrating the
immunoreactivity of p g a53.25 against a panel of norm al rat
tissues is shown in fig. 2b. p g a53.25 strongly recognized a
distinct protein band migrating at approximately 55 kda in
testis, white fat, lung, heart, and liver. lesser amounts of protein were detected in skeletal muscle kidney, and spleen. of the
tissues examined, only pancreas did not appear to show immunoreactivity. these data are in good agreement with the previously published reports of  xxxg1807xxx  mrna expression in rodent and human tissues. (24–27)
figure 3 shows that p g a53.25 immunoprecipitated a single
protein band at approximately 55 kda from a brow n adipose
tissue lysate prepared from normal rats. this band was absent
when there was no prim ary antibody included and when an isotype control mab 5r7 was used, suggesting that the immunoprecipitated protein was  xxxg1807xxx  .
p g a53.25 was used to examine the expression of  xxxg1807xxx 
during differentiation of the murine mesenchym al stem cell line
c3h10t1/2 into adipocytes. lysates were prepared from
c3h10t1/2 cells treated with vehicle (0.02% me 2 so) or differentiation cocktail for 7 days. the differentiation cocktail consisted of either troglitazone or rosiglitazone ( xxxd3147xxx ) in
com bination with insulin and  xxxd3417xxx  (tir and bir, respectively).  xxxg1807xxx  is expressed at high levels in white (wat)

and brown adipose tissue (bat),(9,10,28) and c3h10t1/2 cells
treated with a cocktail containing a tzd display a bat-like
phenotype. therefore, differentiated c3h10t1/2 cells can be
expected to express high levels of  xxxg1807xxx  protein. (29) figure 4
shows that pg a53.25 detected a distinct protein band of approximately 58 kda in lysates from either tir- or bir-treated
c3h10t1/2 cells but not from untreated cells (vehicle alone)
or a mixture of insulin and  xxxd3417xxx  (ir) without  xxxg1807xxx 
agonist.
figure 5a shows that p g a53.25 immunostained nuclei and
occasionally cytoplasm of c3h10t1/2 cells treated with bir.
untreated c3h10t1/2 cells (not shown) and cells treated with
a combination of insulin and  xxxd3417xxx  in the absence of
rosiglitazone exhibited only background staining (fig. 5b). the
staining pattern observed in bir-treated cells was  xxxg1807xxx  subtype specific as shown in fig. 5c, because the staining was
abolished when p g a53.25 was preincubated with immunizing
antigen. preincubation of antibody with the com parable n-terminal region of  xxxg1805xxx  (fig. 5d) or bsa (not-shown) did not
reduce the staining intensity of bir-treated cells. the staining
pattern observed in cells treated with tir was similar to that
of bir-treated cells (data not shown). these data strongly suggest that p g a53.25 recognized an epitope in c3h10t1/2 cell
lysates that was similar to a region of the recombinant human
 xxxg1807xxx  n-terminal protein.
the progression of preadipocytes to fully mature adipocytes
is accompanied by the accumulation of cellular lipid and an increase in the expression of  xxxg1807xxx  mrna.(11) figure 6a shows
that treatm ent of undifferentiated c3h10t1/2 cells with tir or
bir resulted in a dose-dependent increase in cellular lipid measured as total triglycerides. to monitor changes in  xxxg1807xxx  protein expression during these treatments, cells were quantitatively immunostaine d with p g a53.25 using a fluorescent
microtiter screening assay. (23) similar to cellular lipid, we observed a dose-dependent increase in  xxxg1807xxx  immunoreactiv e
protein (fig. 6b). the ec 5 0 for induction of cellular lipid accumulation and the k d for induction of  xxxg1807xxx  protein expression were calculated to be approximately 0.13 m m for rosiglitazone and 1 m m for troglitazone.

discussion
antibodies are versatile tools for the quantification and localization of target antigens in cells and tissues. they are commonly used to elucidate the functions of target molecules in
cells and disease. to understand the biological role of ppars
in key tissues and cell systems, several ppar polyclonal antibodies to ppar a and g have been produced (25,26,30,31) to date.
here, we report the generation of a  xxxg1807xxx  subtype-specific
mab p g a53.25 using the n-term inal domain of human  xxxg1807xxx 
as immunizing antigen, which is the least conserved region
among ppar subtypes. pg a53.25 strongly reacts with a recombinant protein comprised of the n-terminal 2–110 residues
of hum an  xxxg1807xxx  by elisa and western blotting, and does
not cross-react with the n-terminal domains of  xxxg1805xxx  or
 xxxg1806xxx  . it also recognizes full-length  xxxg1807xxx  in rat tissue
lysates (fig. 2b) and murine c3h10t1/2 cells (fig. 4) by western blotting. only a single protein band was detected in the tissue lysates and cells under the gel conditions used. western

c3h10t1/2 cells were treated 7 days with serial dilutions (1.5
nm to 3.3 m m) of  xxxg1807xxx  agonist rosiglitazone (bir m ) or
troglitazone (tir j ) plus 1 m m insulin and 1 m m 9-cis-retinoic
acid. (a) intracellular lipid accumulation. cells were lysed and
the lipid content determined by conversion to triglycerides with
lipase-containing gpo trinder reagent as described in the materials and methods section. absorbance was monitored at 550
nm. error bars represent sem values of two independent experiments. (b) immunofluorescent quantitation of  xxxg1807xxx  protein expression. cells were fixed and permeabilized as described in the materials and methods section. cells were then
immunostained with p g a53.25 (10 m g/ml), followed by phycoethyrin-conjuga ted secondary antibody. fluorescence signals
of stained cells were measured using a titertek fluoroskan ii
equipped with 544-nm excitation/ 590-nm emission filters. the
values shown are the means with standard errors for two separate experiments.

ppar gamma-specific monoclonal antibodies
blotting of immunocom plexes precipitated from rat adipose tissue with p g a53.25 (fig. 3) shows a distinct protein band with
similar molecular weight to that detected in unprecipitated
whole cell lysate (fig. 2b). this clearly demonstrates that
p g a53.25 is capable of detecting native, full-length rat  xxxg1807xxx  .
p g a53.25 also recognizes paraformaldehyd e-fixed, ethanoltreated  xxxg1807xxx  as demonstrated by immunocytoch emistry of
c3h10t1/2 cells (fig. 5). while strong nuclear staining is expected of nuclear proteins, we occasionally observed cytoplasmic staining, possibly due to the presence of newly synthesized
 xxxg1807xxx  protein prior to its translocation to nuclei. a similar cytoplasmic staining pattern is observed when  xxxg1805xxx  -transfected
cv-1 cells are probed with a  xxxg1805xxx  -selective antibody. (23) the
com partmentalized rounded regions that are devoid of staining
in ligand-treated c3h10t1/2 cells have been identified as lipid
droplets by phase microscopy and oil red o staining (data not
shown).
pg a53.25 was used to monitor  xxxg1807xxx  protein expression
during the tzd-induced differentiation of murine pluripotent
c3h10t1/2 cells to mature adipocytes. tzds are potent, selective activators and inducers of  xxxg1807xxx  . treatment of immature
c3h10t1/2 cells with a tzd-containing differentiation cocktail
resulted in a dose-dependent increase in  xxxg1807xxx  protein expression as measured by a fluorescent microtiter assay (fig. 6).
we observed an eight-fold difference in potency between rosiglitazone and troglitazone for inducing expression of  xxxg1807xxx  protein (ed 50 0.13 m m, and 1 m m, respectively), consistent with
their ec50 values for activation of  xxxg1807xxx  in a transient transfection assay. (32) this increase in protein expression correlated
well with the accumulation of cellular lipid. together, these results demonstrate the utility of p g a53.25 as a tool to evaluate
biologically relevant changes in  xxxg1807xxx  expression.
in summary, our data show that p g a53.25, raised against recom binant human n-terminal  xxxg1807xxx  , exhibits (1) specificity
for the  xxxg1807xxx  subtype, (2) western-reactivit y, (3) usefulness
in immunoprecip itation, (4) immunocytoc hemistry reactivity,
and (5) cross-species recognition of human and rodent  xxxg1807xxx  .
this mab will be useful in in vitro and in vivo studies to further elucidate the roles of  xxxg1807xxx  in adipogenesis and carcinogenesis.
