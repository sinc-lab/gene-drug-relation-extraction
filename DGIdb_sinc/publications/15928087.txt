ezetimibe is a potent inhibitor of cholesterol absorption that has
been approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, but its
molecular target has been elusive. using a genetic approach, we
recently identified niemann–pick c1-like 1 ( xxxg1583xxx ) as a critical
mediator of cholesterol absorption and an essential component of
the ezetimibe-sensitive pathway. to determine whether  xxxg1583xxx  is
the direct molecular target of ezetimibe, we have developed a
binding assay and shown that labeled ezetimibe glucuronide binds
specifically to a single site in brush border membranes and to
human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing  xxxg1583xxx . moreover,
the binding affinities of ezetimibe and several key analogs to
recombinant  xxxg1583xxx  are virtually identical to those observed for
native enterocyte membranes. kd values of ezetimibe glucuronide
for mouse, rat, rhesus monkey, and human  xxxg1583xxx  are 12,000, 540,
40, and 220 nm, respectively. last, ezetimibe no longer binds to
membranes from  xxxg1583xxx  knockout mice. these results unequivocally establish  xxxg1583xxx  as the direct target of ezetimibe and should
facilitate efforts to identify the molecular mechanism of cholesterol transport.

potential candidate gene by a search of expressed sequence tag
databases by using the following criteria: presence of a sterolsensing domain (ssd), a plasma membrane secretion signal, and
enriched expression in intestinal enterocytes. mice deficient in
 xxxg1583xxx  had ⬇70% reduction in sterol absorption, with the
residual being insensitive to ezetimibe (19). these findings
convincingly demonstrated that  xxxg1583xxx  is central to cholesterol
uptake in enterocytes and is in a pathway sensitive to ezetimibe,
but did not establish the molecular basis.
to determine whether  xxxg1583xxx  is the direct molecular target
of ezetimibe, we have established a radioligand binding assay for
ezetimibe using enterocyte brush border membranes (bbms)
from several species. binding affinities were determined for
ezetimibe and several key analogs to native membranes, membranes from cells expressing recombinant  xxxg1583xxx , and enterocyte bbms from  xxxg1583xxx -deficient mice. together, the results
definitively establish  xxxg1583xxx  as the direct target of ezetimibe in
vivo.

lood cholesterol levels are regulated by several processes,
including de novo synthesis, cholesterol absorption, and
biliary clearance and excretion. absorption of dietary and biliary
cholesterol occurs in the proximal jejunum of the small intestine
(1). ezetimibe is a potent cholesterol and phytosterol uptake
inhibitor (2, 3) and is used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. ezetimibe effectively lowers circulating plasma cholesterol in humans by 15–20% (4–6), and coadministration of
ezetimibe with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coa (hmg-coa)
reductase inhibitors (statins), inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis,
results in additive effects on cholesterol reduction (7–11).
for the past decade, there have been intense efforts to
determine the molecular target of ezetimibe. uptake and sorting
of cholesterol and phytosterols by intestinal enterocytes is a
complex process (for a synopsis, see ref. 12). this phenomenon
is believed to involve a variety of mediators, including the
atp-binding cassette (abc) transporters  xxxg9xxx , abcg5,
and g8, and the scavenger receptor b1 ( xxxg2013xxx ), but knockouts
have ruled out each of these proteins as promoting net sterol
uptake from the intestine (13–16). other multidrug-resistance
transporters in the abc and rnd (resistance–nodulation–
division) superfamilies have also been proposed to be gatekeepers of intracellular sterol and lipid homeostasis in mammals, but
their specific molecular functions remain uncertain (for a review,
see ref. 17).
recently, we demonstrated that niemann–pick c1-like 1
( xxxg1583xxx ) (18) is essential in the ezetimibe responsive pathway
of cholesterol absorption (19). this protein was identified as a

containing 0.1 mm pmsf and a 1% dilution of a protease inhibitor
mixture (set 1, calbiochem). they were homogenized by using a
polytron at medium speed on ice until inspection with a microscope
indicated complete cell lysis. then, solid mgcl2 was added slowly
with stirring to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the solution was
kept stirring on ice for 15 min. cellular debris was removed by
centrifugation for 15 min at 3,000 ⫻ g, and the membranes were
recovered by centrifugation for 60 min at 48,000 ⫻ g. the membranes were further rinsed by resuspension in a buffer containing
50 mm  xxxd2540xxx , 5 mm egta, and 2 mm tris at ph 7.40 and

by using ␥-glutamyltransferase as a marker enzyme (21), which
indicated 6-fold enrichment over the initial homogenate.

(corning) in dmem containing 10% fcs, 4.5 g兾liter d-glucose
and l-glutamine at 18 h before transfection. they were transiently transfected with 25 ␮g of dna by using fugene
transfection reagent (roche biochemical) at a fugene兾dna
ratio of 6:1. after transfection, the cells were incubated at 37°c
and 5% co2 for 48 h and then harvested by using pbs-based cell
dissociation buffer (gibco), pelleted at 500 ⫻ g, snap frozen on
dry ice, and stored at ⫺80°c.

treated by soaking with 0.5% polyethylenimine to reduce nonspecific binding. filtration was accomplished by adding 2.5 ml of
ice cold buffer (120 mm nacl兾0.1% sodium cholate兾20 mm

filter, and then rinsing the tube and filter twice more with
another 2 ⫻ 2.5-ml buffer. the filters were counted in 7-ml vials
by using ultima gold mv liquid scintillation fluid (packard).
where triplicate assays were performed, the standard error was
typically ⬍4%. as an example, assay of rat bbms at 2 mg兾ml in
the presence of 400,000 dpm (50 nm) [3h]eze-gluc gave 15,000
dpm specific binding and 3,000 dpm nonspecific binding. the
filters contributed most of the nonspecific binding (2,000 dpm).

pared by resuspending the frozen cell pellets in 10 volumes of 20
mm hepes兾tris buffer at ph 7.40 containing 8% sucrose, and
sonicating the suspensions with a probe sonicator on ice until
most of the cells were lysed. to isolate the membranes, the
sonicates were centrifuged at 1,600 ⫻ g for 10 min to remove cell
debris, and then the supernatants were centrifuged at 125,000 ⫻
g for 3 h to recover the membranes. the recombinant  xxxg1583xxx 
appears to localize in particularly small vesicles, such that
complete recovery requires this prolonged centrifugation time.
the recovered membranes were resuspended in 20 mm hepes兾
 xxxd3449xxx  at ph 7.40 containing 160 mm nacl and 5% glycerol,
and stored  xxxd1891xxx –20 mg兾ml protein at ⫺80°c. the recovery
amounted to 80% of the binding in the initial homogenate.

encountered in work with the recombinant  xxxg1583xxx  was that the
number of binding sites in transfected  xxxg1583xxx –293 cell membrane preparations initially appeared quite low. this unexpected
result prompted investigation of the influence of several detergents on apparent binding affinity below their critical micelle
concentrations. among the most effective were  xxxd3296xxx  and
digitonin, particularly in combination. in the most dramatic case,
a combination of 0.03%  xxxd3296xxx  and 0.05% digitonin
increased apparent binding by 5-fold to native rat bbm preparations, and as much as 25-fold to recombinant rat and human
 xxxg1583xxx –293 cell membranes, as shown in fig. 1. the effect is
primarily on bmax rather than kd, and it also depends on
membrane concentration. although most of the initial work with
native membrane preparations did not employ these detergents,
they greatly facilitated ki comparisons between recombinant and
native  xxxg1583xxx  (see figs. 5 and 6 and table 2).
the molecular basis for this dramatic enhancement by detergents is obscure. the individual effects of  xxxd3296xxx  and
digitonin appear to be additive. at concentrations below their
critical micelle concentration, these detergents do not appreciably solubilize membrane proteins, but they do disrupt the
permeability barrier of vesicles. because their effect is principally to increase the number of binding sites (bmax), perhaps they
act by disrupting the membranes enough to allow eze-gluc to
gain access to transporter facing the inside, or otherwise hidden
in the interior of the multilamellar membrane vesicles.

[3h]eze-gluc binding assay. assays were conducted in 12 ⫻ 75 mm
glass test tubes and total volume 20–100 ␮l. in general, frozen
membranes were diluted in buffer a alone or buffer a containing 0.03%  xxxd3296xxx  and 0.05% digitonin to a final concentration of 0.5–5 mg兾ml. final concentrations of [3h]eze-gluc 1
were typically 25–50 nm and were delivered as dmso or
ch3cn solutions. competing ligands were likewise added as
dmso solutions to give a total 1–5% organic solvent content.
nonspecific binding was defined by competition with 100–500
␮m eze-gluc. at least three components of buffer a (the
bicarbonate and phosphate salts and glucose) were later found
to be inconsequential and were routinely omitted. reactions
were incubated until equilibrium was achieved (1 h for rat or 3 h
for rhesus membranes).

results and discussion
after in vivo administration, ezetimibe is rapidly glucuronidated
and recycled by the enterohepatic circulation to its target site in the
intestine. this glucuronide metabolite is at least as potent as
ezetimibe with respect to inhibition of cholesterol uptake (2, 25)
and has more suitable physical properties for in vitro binding studies.
accordingly, evidence for specific binding to native enterocyte
extracts was sought by using [3h]eze-gluc 1 (structure 1).
results of initial binding studies using a traditional rapidfiltration assay on glass-fiber filters showed marginal specific
binding to homogenates of scrapings from rat intestine. subsequently, preparation of bbms from these homogenates markedly improved the specific binding and showed that it exclusively
resides in the membrane fraction. this assay and the bbm
preparations are described in detail in methods.
binding studies using [3h]eze-gluc subsequently were extended to enterocyte bbm preparations from mouse and rhesus
monkey, as well as rat (table 1). the binding affinity is relatively
weak in rat membranes (kd ⫽ 542 nm) and weaker in murine
membranes (kd ⫽ 10,000 nm). in contrast, binding affinity in
rhesus monkey membranes is ⬇10-fold more potent than for rat
(kd ⫽ 41 nm).

the kd values refer to [3h]eze-gluc binding to enterocyte bbm preparations, as determined in the absence of detergents. the in vivo ed50 values are
from cholesterol absorption and cholesterol feeding studies with ezetimibe in

binding sites, on and off rates, and competition by unlabeled
compound (fig. 2). the scatchard analyses and the specific兾
nonspecific binding windows are shown in fig. 2 a, b, f, and g.
the observed binding was specific, saturable, and consistent with
a single molecular site. the number of binding sites varied from
5–20 pmol兾mg membrane protein, depending on species and
preparation.
the rates for binding and dissociation were also determined
and found to be slow relative to those typically observed for
protein–ligand interactions. the rate constants for association to
rat and monkey bbms are kon ⫽ 5.54 and 3.90 ⫻ 103 m⫺1
s⫺1(fig. 2 c, d, h, and i). these are 10,000-fold smaller than the
diffusion-controlled limit of 108-109 m⫺1 s⫺1. similarly, these
complexes are unusually long-lived, dissociating with rate constants of koff ⫽ 2.4 ⫻ 10⫺3 s⫺1 and 1.2 ⫻ 10⫺4 s⫺1 at 25°c,
equivalent to half-lives of 5 and 96 min for the rat and monkey
complexes, respectively. in comparison, half-lives are normally
⬍1 s for dissociation of common diffusion-controlled 100 nm kd
ligands. these rate constants predict kd values (kd ⫽ koff兾kon)
of 440 and 32 nm, respectively, which agree well with those
measured by equilibrium titration (fig. 2 e and j) and saturation
(fig. 2 b and g). such slow-forming, long-lived complexes
suggest that conformational changes in the protein are ratelimiting.
the binding affinities of 1 to bbms correlate well across
species with the sensitivity to ezetimibe inhibition of cholesterol
uptake in vivo (mouse ⬍ rat ⬍ monkey) (2, 26–27), consistent
with the hypothesis that the assay is relevant to the target of
ezetimibe in vivo (table 1). as evidence that this interaction is
very specific, the glucuronide of the enantiomer of ezetimibe was
prepared and found to be completely inactive in vitro (ki ⬎ 100 ⫻
kd for eze-gluc in all species) and in vivo (data not shown) in
a rat acute cholesterol-absorption model.
to obtain further evidence that the binding assay was detecting the target of ezetimibe in vivo, the specific binding affinity of
1 was measured along the intestinal axis. previous studies have
established that cholesterol absorption occurs primarily in the
jejunum and is substantially lower in the ileum and duodenum
(1). the binding studies of [3h]ezetimibe glucuronide to both rat
and rhesus confirmed this prediction, with the highest concentration of binding sites peaking in the proximal jejunum. the
distribution is illustrated in fig. 3. together, the above results
strongly suggest that the observed binding is due to the target of
ezetimibe in vivo.
pursuing the recent evidence indicating that  xxxg1583xxx  is an
essential component of the pathway inhibited by ezetimibe,
recombinant human  xxxg1583xxx  was expressed in hek 293 cells
(fig. 4a). preliminary binding studies using 1 revealed specific
binding to membrane preparations from cells expressing
 xxxg1583xxx  and no specific binding to membranes from mock
transfected cells (data not shown). binding to  xxxg1583xxx  expressing cells was also observed with a bodipy-labeled fluorescent
eze-gluc analog (sch354909) (15) (fig. 4ba). binding of
sch354909 was clearly evident at the cell surface membrane of
the  xxxg1583xxx -expressing cells and was abolished in the presence
of excess unlabeled eze-gluc (fig. 4bc). no binding was observed in wt hek 293 cells (fig. 4 b b and d). these results
demonstrated that eze-gluc binds specifically to  xxxg1583xxx .
to obtain evidence that  xxxg1583xxx  is the direct binding target
of ezetimibe in vivo, binding affinities of 1 and several key
analogs were determined for recombinant rat and human
 xxxg1583xxx  expressed in hek 293 cell membranes and compared
with those for native rat and rhesus intestinal enterocyte bbms.
a series of ezetimibe analogs was selected with subtle structural
diversity but with binding affinities to native bbms that covered
a range of 1,000-fold. as shown in fig. 5 and table 2, the kd
values for recombinant rat  xxxg1583xxx  and native rat bbms are
virtually identical, strongly suggesting that  xxxg1583xxx  is the mogarcia-calvo et al.

binding affinities for native monkey bbms are uniformly ⬇10fold more potent. this result is consistent with the finding that
ezetimibe is an order of magnitude more potent in monkeys than
in humans or rats (2, 28).

were as follows: 1.25 mg兾ml protein and 100 nm 1 for a, b, and d, and 1.25
mg兾ml protein and 20 nm 1 for c. observed total and nonspecific binding in
the absence of inhibition were 7,700 and 1,100 (a), 33,000 and 1,100 (b), 7,300
and 367 (c), and 19,200 and 1,000 (d) dpm. analogs were 1, eze-gluc (red
squares); ent-1, the glucuronide of the enantiomer of ezetimibe (open black
circles); 2 (blue circles); 3 (open red squares); 4 (open black triangles); and 5
(blue triangles), as defined in table 2.

recently, an intracellular annexin 2兾caveolin 1 complex (29)
and an enterocyte cell surface  xxxg163xxx  (30) have been
suggested as potential targets for ezetimibe. however, these
studies did not include a quantitative comparison of binding
between recombinant proteins and bbms, nor did they report
deletion of the putative target in genetically modified mice.
 xxxg2013xxx  (scavenger receptor type b1) was also identified as a
potential target by using an expression cloning strategy employing ezetimibe binding to candidate proteins; this hypothesis was
readily dismissed when neither cholesterol absorption nor
ezetimibe activity were affected in  xxxg2013xxx -deficient mice (16).
conversely, this article demonstrates that ezetimibe binds to
native intestinal membranes and cells expressing recombinant
 xxxg1583xxx  with comparable affinity and does not bind to membranes from  xxxg1583xxx -deficient mice, indicating a specific binding interaction between  xxxg1583xxx  and ezetimibe. together with
the previously published findings that mice deficient in  xxxg1583xxx 
are defective in intestinal cholesterol uptake and are no longer
responsive to ezetimibe (19), these data definitively establish
 xxxg1583xxx  as the direct target of ezetimibe.
further insights into the molecular mechanism of cholesterol
transport by  xxxg1583xxx  will be required to fully understand how
ezetimibe binding blocks intestinal cholesterol absorption. although it is clear that ezetimibe binding to  xxxg1583xxx  is sufficient to
block cholesterol uptake, it is reasonable to speculate that  xxxg1583xxx 
functions within a multiprotein complex to transport cholesterol.

six analogs of eze-gluc are compared for their potency against rat and
human recombinant  xxxg1583xxx  and native rat and monkey bbm preparations.
the ent-eze-gluc has the stereochemical configuration 3s, 4r and is the
glucuronide of the enantiomer of ezetimibe. the titrations supporting these
data are shown in fig. 5. these determinations were conducted in buffer
containing 0.03%  xxxd3296xxx  and 0.05% digitonin, levels below the critical
micelle concentrations of these detergents. these conditions enhanced apparent binding by as much as 25-fold for the recombinant preparations
(principally a bmax effect), and greatly facilitated a quantitative comparison of
ki values for 1 and its analogs (see methods).

interesting features of  xxxg1583xxx  is that it contains the ssd
originally observed in scap [sterol regulatory element binding
protein (srebp) cleavage-activating protein]. scap controls
activation of srebp, a transcription factor which controls ⬎35
genes related to lipid and cholesterol homeostasis (31). the ssd,
consisting of ⬇180 aa in a packet of five putative membranespanning helices, also serves a regulatory function in two key
enzymes on the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and is present
in the receptor patched. recently, high-affinity binding of
cholesterol to the ssd on scap has been demonstrated (32),
suggesting that cholesterol may similarly bind to the ssd of
 xxxg1583xxx . similar competition experiments between ezetimibe
and cholesterol will be needed to define precisely whether
 xxxg1583xxx  binds cholesterol and, therefore, is the cholesterol

transporter per se or, alternatively, an associated regulatory
component that indirectly influences cholesterol transport.
in summary, the data presented here clearly identify  xxxg1583xxx 
as the direct molecular target of ezetimibe. these results may
lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of
cholesterol transport and the design of even more potent cholesterol-absorption inhibitors.
