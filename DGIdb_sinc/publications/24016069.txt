expert opinion

introduction: parkinson’s disease (pd) is a neurobehavioral disorder defined
by its motor features. its treatment is frequently complicated by the presence
of psychotic symptoms, most prominently hallucinations and delusions. these
cause major distress and are the primary cause for nursing home placement.
current treatment requires either a reduction in medications for mobility or
the addition of atypical antipsychotics, none of which are approved in the
united states, and which are associated with major potential drawbacks.
areas covered: information from extensive personal experience, a pubmed
literature search plus a direct request to acadia pharmaceuticals was used
for this review. a brief review of the clinical problem and its current state of
treatment will be followed by a discussion of  xxxd2953xxx  and its potential
role in treating pd psychosis (pdp). several observations have implicated serotonin in the physiology of psychotic symptoms.  xxxd2527xxx ,
phencyclidine, and similar drugs that activate 5ht2a serotonin receptors produce psychotic syndromes, and almost all antipsychotic neuroleptics share the
property of blocking the 5ht2a receptor as well as the dopamine  xxxg656xxx .
the reduced motor side effects of the second-generation antipsychotics have
been ascribed to these drugs having greater 5ht2a antagonism than the first
generation. studies in animal models of psychosis have suggested benefits
from drugs blocking the 5ht2a receptor alone without the motor side effects
seen with  xxxg656xxx  antagonism.
expert opinion:  xxxd2953xxx , a 5ht2a  xxxd1422xxx , has no motor side
effects, and a remarkable safety profile that is comparable to placebo. its antipsychotic effects coupled with its lack of motor side effects could make it an
ideal drug for treating psychotic symptoms in pd, a major unmet need. one
phase iii trial in pdp has demonstrated excellent tolerability and significant
benefit. the fda agreed to the filing of a planned new drug approval
(nda) for an indication in the treatment of pdp.

introduction

 xxxd2953xxx , a serotonin 5ht2-a  xxxd1422xxx  [1,2], is a new drug with exciting
potential. it represents a novel approach to treating psychotic symptoms, by targeting a non-dopamine neurotransmitter. all fda-approved antipsychotics share the
property of dopamine  xxxg656xxx  antagonism. as a result, almost all antipsychotics
may induce parkinsonism, an akinetic rigid syndrome that looks like idiopathic
parkinson’s disease (pd). the 5ht2a receptor is one of 14 serotonin receptors,
5 of which have been implicated in psychotic symptoms [3]. the rationale for its purported potential lies both in the theoretical construct of psychotic symptom pathophysiology, largely derived from responses to antipsychotic medications in humans,

as well as animal models of psychosis [4]. serotonin receptor
blockade is not associated with extrapyramidal syndromes.
there are also data suggesting that 5ht2a antagonists
increase slow wave sleep [5], a potential benefit in some sleep
disorders. human data now expand our understanding of
the drug’s effects with trial results in schizophrenia [6], slow
wave sleep [7], and parkinson’s disease psychosis (pdp) [2,8].
while all physicians are familiar with the concepts of drug
agonists and antagonists, few clinicians are aware of “inverse
agonists.” to understand what an  xxxd1422xxx  is requires
the basic knowledge that some receptors allow a basal level
of activity, that is, even in the absence of an agonist, there is
an intrinsic level of activity that occurs with a passive, nonstimulated receptor [9]. an agonist increases this activity. an
antagonist blocks the action of the agonist, but does not
inhibit the resting, or intrinsic level of activity, associated
with the receptor. an  xxxd1422xxx , on the other hand,
blocks the basal level of activity permitted by the receptor,
and therefore causes an effect that is opposite to that of the
agonist. thus, an antagonist blocks an increase in a receptor’s
activity when an agonist is present, whereas an  xxxd1422xxx 
reverses the activity of the receptor when no agonist is present,
and also blocks the action of the agonist, if present.

parkinson’s disease psychosis

the most common primary, or naturally occurring, psychotic
syndromes are schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar
disorder. psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusions, however, occur in a much wider distribution, occurring
most commonly with delirium, dementia, and as a drug
effect. hallucinations and psychosis are common problems
in drug-treated pd [10]. no medication has been approved
by the fda for this problem.
pd is considered a movement disorder but it should more
accurately be considered a neurobehavioral disorder [11,12].
depression affects 20 -- 50% of patients, anxiety about
20 -- 40%, and sleep disorders up to 90%. dementia
1970

ultimately claims about 80%, psychotic symptoms 30%,
and apathy 40%; fatigue 50%, impulse control disorders
affect about 10 -- 15% of those treated with dopamine agonists, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder affects
about 30% of men with pd. the concept of “treating” pd is
almost always thought of as the treatment of the motor symptoms, primarily slowness, gait difficulties, and tremor. only
one drug, the anti-dementia medication, rivastigmine, is
approved in the united states by the fda for treating any
non-motor symptom. its effects on psychotic symptoms
have not been adequately studied.
psychosis in pd is one of many unmet needs in pd. while
often considered a medication-induced problem, reconsideration has persuaded experts to categorize pdp as occurring
with anti-pd medications or without [13]. psychotic symptoms in pd often herald the onset of dementia so that while
dementia is the largest risk factor for pdp, psychotic symptoms are a major risk factor for dementia [14]. nevertreated pd patients may develop hallucinations [15]. pdp
differs from schizophrenia most basically in the absence of
negative symptoms in the former [10,16]. in addition, pdp primarily consists of hallucinations, which are primarily visual,
and usually without emotional content. auditory hallucinations are about half as common as the visual. delusions occur
much less frequently and are generally paranoid in nature,
with jealous delusions being the most common [16], often
increasing with worsening dementia.
there have been many reports, primarily chart reviews but
also controlled double-blind studies on the treatment of pdp.
the first ever multicenter trial for the treatment of any nonmotor problem in pd was an american placebo-controlled
trial of low-dose clozapine [17], which demonstrated that
clozapine, at doses between 6.25 mg and 50 mg/day (usual
doses in schizophrenia range between 300 and 800 mg/day),
was effective and well tolerated. these results were replicated
with the same study design in europe [18]. both studies showed
that clozapine did not worsen parkinsonism. in fact, clozapine
improves tremor [17,19]. its effect on psychosis is faster and more
robust than it is in primary psychiatric disorders.
placebo-controlled trials of olanzapine [20-22] led to a blackbox warning due to worsening parkinsonism and a lack of
benefit. placebo-controlled trials of quetiapine showed that
the drug was well tolerated, without motor worsening, but
was ineffective [23-25]. a single double-blind trial found it to
be effective but the numbers were too small to be persuasive [26]. other second-generation antipsychotics (sga) have
not been tested in double-blind placebo-controlled trials
(dbpct) and published reports are small unblinded series
or isolated case reports. all drugs, including low-dose aripiprazole, a partial dopamine agonist, which, theoretically
should improve motor function as well as psychosis, have
been found to often worsen motor function [27-29].
the extreme sensitivity of pd patients to parkinsonian side
effects is clearly related to the reduced numbers of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain. blockade of dopamine d2

receptors, a feature common to all current antipsychotics, presumably aggravates an already stressed system. why clozapine
and quetiapine, alone among the sga, do not cause worsened
motor function is the subject of debate. one theory holds that
the dopaminergic receptor blockade is long enough to treat
psychotic symptoms but not long enough to influence motor
function [30]. a competing theory maintains that the balance
of 5ht2a receptor blockade versus dopamine d2 blockade
determines motor side effects [31].
clozapine is approved in some countries for the treatment
of pdp, but not in the united states. the american academy
of neurology (aan) task force on pd only suggests that clozapine be “considered,” along with quetiapine, despite the evidence of efficacy in the former and failure in the latter [32].
although clozapine is typically used in doses under 50 mg,
which rarely causes metabolic derangements, the risk of
agranulocytosis is not dose related [33] so that blood-count
monitoring is the same as that required for schizophrenia
(weekly for six months, then biweekly for six months, then
four-weekly forever while on the drug).

1005.12 g/mol. its chemical formula is (1-[(4-fluorophenyl)

in two dbpct [38] involving 25 healthy young men, average
age 26,  xxxd2953xxx  was found to be well tolerated. although
kinetics were not altered whether given in pill or liquid form,
the liquid form was bitter tasting and poorly tolerated for its
taste. the drug’s properties were evaluated in single-dose
studies going out to 216 h, and daily dosing for doses varying
between 20 and 300 mg/day. regardless of dosing, the serum
half-life ranged between 54 and 56 h and the median tmax
was 6 h. the drug reached steady state  xxxd2274xxx  days for single
daily dosing and dose-proportionate pharmacokinetics were
reported. the drug was 94 -- 97% protein bound unrelated
to time of sampling. there was low inter-subject variability in
any measure of drug kinetics.

pharmacodynamics
6.

serotonin 5ht2a receptors are widely distributed in the
brain [34]. these are expressed primarily in layer v of the
cortex in both rodents and humans [34] and are also found
in hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, striatum,
and hypothalamus [34]. interestingly, with respect to pd, is
the finding of an increase in these receptors in a small sample
(eight) of brains of people who died with pd [35]. they are
stimulated by  xxxd2527xxx  and similar
hallucinogens [36].
 xxxd2953xxx  (box 1) has a 40-fold lower affinity for
5ht2c receptors than 2a and exhibited no activity against
other g-protein-coupled receptors [1]. its presumed antipsychotic activity included decreased dizocilpine-induced
hyperactivity in mice and 2,5 dimethoxy 4 iodoamphetamineinduced prepulse inhibition deficits in rats, a rodent model of
psychosis. unlike antipsychotic drugs, no catalepsy was induced
even at high doses, nor were other motor effects present.
imaging studies using [11c] n-methylspiperone to measure
serotonin receptor occupancy in 4 subjects only found almost
80% occupancy in the cortex at doses of 10 mg/day [37].
twenty percent occupancy was noted at a dose of 1 mg/day.
this ligand is not specific to 5ht2a receptors however,
although  xxxd2953xxx  is. in trials in pdp, doses above
60 mg produced no better response than 40 mg/day, so that
only the 40 mg dose was used in the most recent phase iii
trial.

clinical efficacy (tables 2 and 3)

in a phase ii double-blind study, 60 patients with idiopathic
pd and pdp were randomized to receive either  xxxd2953xxx 
or placebo [39]. subjects had to meet a minimum severity score
of 4 on the hallucinations and delusions sections of the neuropsychiatric inventory (npi). anti-pd medications were
stable during the week before entry and during the fourweek study.  xxxd2953xxx  was initiated at 20 mg and
advanced to 40 or 60 mg as determined by clinical response.
as this was a safety study, the primary outcome result was
that there were no significant differences in side effects
between active drug and placebo. most importantly for an
antipsychotic,  xxxd2953xxx  did not affect motor function.
however, the effects on psychotic symptoms, as measured
by the scale for the assessment of positive symptoms
(saps), a scale devised for use in schizophrenia, were not at
the prespecified p level of 0.05. the saps delusions’ overall
score improved from 5.9 to 3.5 (p + 0.06), whereas there
was no change on placebo; the saps hallucination score
improved from 10.8 to 7.6 on  xxxd2953xxx  vs 11.6 to
10.5 on placebo (p = 0.06). there were nonstatistically significant benefits seen in all four measures of behavior in the
updrs, the clinical global impression (cgi) score, the
epworth sleepiness scale, the parkinson’s psychosis rating
scale, and activities of daily living.
the first phase iii trial of  xxxd2953xxx  in pdp was a
mixed success [40]. the results, only available in abstract
form, involved 259 subjects who completed a 6-week, multicentered, international dbpct of pimvanserin  xxxd1891xxx  and
40 mg/day. subjects required an npi score of at least 4
and an saps combined hallucinations and delusions
(saps h&d) score of 5, had to have been psychiatrically

ill for over a month, on stable pd medications, and an
mmse above 20. the primary outcome variable was the
saps h&d score. the study did not find a statistically significant benefit on this measure at either dose, although
there were nonsignificant benefits found in every primary
and secondary measure, with a safety profile similar to that
of placebo. there was no worsening of parkinsonism. one
unanticipated problem was the high placebo response rate
of 42%. the results were prospectively analyzed post hoc,
separating the american sites from those outside because
the primary endpoint was assessed differently in the united
states compared to the rest of the world. central raters
were used in the united states but not outside. in this analysis, involving 123 subjects, the placebo response was considerably less than in the rest of the world, indicating an
advantage of  xxxd2953xxx  40 mg over placebo, statistically
significant at two weeks, and almost significant at six weeks.
the absolute change in the saps h&d score was 2.5 at
42 days, the end of the trial. the main difference between
the us sites and the rest of the world was the much reduced
placebo effect. the  xxxd2953xxx  benefit was seen in all
measures, albeit not statistically significant. the post hoc
analysis was performed due to concern that the nonus sites were less experienced clinical researchers and the
1972

us sites used a centralized evaluation service, presumably
less influenced by knowing the subject and the subject’s stage
in the trial.
the second phase iii trial [8] restricted sites to north
america and implemented two major design changes. one
was the use of centralized raters for psychosis who interviewed
the patient and caregiver via a video-monitor. a different rater
was used for each visit so that the rater was unaware of
whether the subject was entering or completing the trial.
this presumably eliminated a lot of rater bias. the second
change was to introduce a two-week period after screening
so that subjects were rated again before beginning study
drug to eliminate “baseline creep,” a source of bias in which
subjects who may not have been sufficiently severe were
enrolled in the study. in addition, only a single dose of drug
was used, 40 mg/day. in this 6-week study, 199 nondemented subjects were randomized 1:1. the primary
endpoint, a significant change in the saps, modified for
pd, was achieved, along with a significant improvement in
the cgi scale, the site investigator’s global assessment of psychosis. caregiver burden, daytime somnolence, and overnight
sleep quality all were improved as well, with no change in
motor function, and excellent tolerability. despite the tolerability, this did not lead to unblinding of the investigators. as
of this writing, the data are only available in abstract form.
it is always risky to compare one trial with another, especially with different drugs and designs. the clozapine trials
used the whole saps, not the saps pd, as was used in the
 xxxd2953xxx  trial. however, the mean improvement in the
cgi over placebo was 1.1 with clozapine versus 0.67 with
 xxxd2953xxx , and the saps-pd mean improvement with
 xxxd2953xxx  over placebo was 3, whereas the total saps
mean improvement over placebo with clozapine was 8. the
clozapine trials used investigators as raters rather than central
raters blind to subject’s entry or exit status, hence exposed to
potential bias. the results from the positive phase iii trial
then, along with the less impressive results from the earlier trials, suggest that the  xxxd2953xxx  benefit may be considerably
less than that of clozapine, but better than that of quetiapine
and better tolerated than either.

expert opinion

the use development of  xxxd2953xxx  as an antipsychotic
will, depending on efficacy, represent a major advance in
pharmacotherapy in both theoretical and practical terms.
the drug was to be tested in further phase iii trials but the
fda decided that these were not needed and acadia pharmaceuticals, the developer, was invited to file for approval of the
treatment of pdp. this is a disorder for which there is no
fda-approved treatment. and, while quetiapine and clozapine are generally used to treat this syndrome, each drug is
only recommended for “consideration” by the aan task force
on the treatment of pd. in addition, the few dbpct trials of
quetiapine have demonstrated good motor tolerability but no

 xxxd2953xxx 

efficacy. clozapine, while effective and tolerated, nevertheless
requires weekly cbc monitoring for the first six months followed by every other week monitoring for the next six months
before dropping down to every four weeks forever, due to the
small but lethal risk of agranulocytosis. in addition to this
potentially lethal but small risk, these two drugs share the
very common problems of sedation and orthostatic hypotension, which may be intolerable in pd due to an increased
risk of falls and worsened cognition.  xxxd2953xxx  has no
hematological or orthostatic side effects, does not induce
sedation, and may enhance nocturnal sleeping.
the theoretical implication of a 5ht2a  xxxd1422xxx 
having antipsychotic efficacy is that targets other than dopamine will be considered in the search for new antipsychotic
drugs even in the setting of psychosis triggered by increased
dopamine stimulation. while the second generation of antipsychotics seems to have reduced the motor side effects, they
have not eliminated them, and certainly have brought with
them very significant non-motor side effects like the metabolic
syndrome and sedation. perhaps even more important is the
observation that the sga are not significantly more effective
than the first generation [41]. neither set of drugs is particularly
helpful at treating negative symptoms or cognition.
the first practical advance will be the use of  xxxd2953xxx 
for treating pdp. as with all therapy, treatments are introduced when the risk-to-benefit ratio favors benefit. since quetiapine and clozapine have major downsides, they are
generally not introduced until quality of life has significantly
deteriorated. with a drug that has a very benign sideeffect profile, it is likely that  xxxd2953xxx  will be introduced
when hallucinations are still relatively mild. currently, quetiapine and clozapine are reserved until the hallucinations are
quite bothersome or when delusions develop. most pd
patients prefer to not hallucinate. the hallucinations are generally not frightening or threatening, but the very fact that the
brain is producing an image that is not real undermines the
patient’s beliefs in his own perceptions, and is not a welcome

phenomenon. it is likely that patients offered a well-tolerated
treatment would opt to take it before the hallucinations
become too bothersome. it is likely that  xxxd2953xxx  will
be widely used. the possible efficacy of  xxxd2953xxx  in
psychotic syndromes associated with other neurological
disorders cannot be predicted.
how successful  xxxd2953xxx  will be at improving sleep
maintenance will require further evaluation. while this is a
potentially large market, there are many disorders that contribute to sleep fragmentation in the elderly and, more importantly, there are no data to demonstrate that increasing
slow-wave sleep will improve sleep quality in people with
sleep disorders.
it is hoped that the development of an anti-serotonin agent
will lead to additional fruitful paths off the well-travelled
dopamine track. future research will involve trials for the
treatment of psychotic symptoms in alzheimer’s and other
dementing disorders. there may also be worthwhile exploring
the effects of  xxxd2953xxx  in both l-dopa dyskinesias [42]
and tardive dyskinesia.
summary of expert opinion
 xxxd2953xxx  represents a novel approach to treat pdp,
an often devastating disorder for which there is no fdaapproved medication. studies involving large numbers of
subjects convincingly demonstrate its safety. one phase iii
trial provides proof of clinically significant efficacy.
