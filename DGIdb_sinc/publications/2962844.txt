inhibitory mechanism of acarbose and 1- xxxd1955xxx  derivatives on carbohydrases in rat small intestine.  the inhibitory action and mechanism of inhibition of two types of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, acarbose ( xxxd57xxx ) and 1- xxxd1955xxx  derivatives ( xxxd2644xxx  and bay-o-1248), on small intestinal carbohydrases (sucrase,  xxxg2070xxx ,  xxxg1401xxx , trehalase and lactase) and  xxxg158xxx  were compared in vitro using small intestinal brush border membranes and pancreatic homogenates from adult sprague-dawley rats. acarbose at a low (4 microm) concentration strongly inhibited the activities of  xxxg1401xxx , alpha-amylase and sucrase (98, 68, and 63%, respectively). at a high (200 microm) concentration,  xxxg2070xxx  activity was also inhibited (28%); effects on trehalase and lactase activities were negligible. both the 1- xxxd1955xxx  derivatives were even more potent inhibitors of sucrase (ki = 8.6 x 10(-8) m for  xxxd2644xxx ;ki = 5.0 x 10(-8) m for bay-o-1248) than acarbose (ki = 9.9 x 10(-7) m). whereas  xxxg1401xxx  activity was strongly inhibited by the 1- xxxd1955xxx  derivatives, alpha-amylase activity was not. in contrast to acarbose, the 1- xxxd1955xxx  derivatives at high concentrations (20-200 microm) inhibited considerably trehalase and lactase (a beta-galactosidase) activities. the inhibition of lactase activity was stronger by  xxxd2644xxx  (ki = 4.9 x 10(-6) m) than by bay-o-1248 (ki = 6.7 x 10(-5) m). where inhibition was seen, kinetic analysis showed fully competitive inhibition of sucrase,  xxxg2070xxx , trehalase,  xxxg1401xxx  and lactase by all three inhibitors.
