short-term effect of acarbose on specific intestinal disaccharidase activities and hyperglycaemia in cba diabetic mice.  the purpose of this study was to examine the short-term effects of 75, 100 and 150 mg of acarbose mixed in 100 g standard laboratory chow on specific intestinal disaccharidase activities and on hyperglycaemia in diabetic cba strain mice on standard diet. the small intestine was excised and divided into three segments, from pylorus to duodenum, and two equal lengths of the jejunum and ileum of control and diabetic mice with or without added acarbose. specific  xxxg1401xxx  and sucrase activities were determined using maltose and sucrose as substrates respectively. increased specific activities of  xxxg1401xxx  and sucrase were detected in the intestines of cba mice on standard laboratory diet seven days after alloxan-induced diabetes. feeding for 7 days with 75, 100 or 150 mg acarbose uniformly mixed in 100 g standard laboratory chow, induced a decrease in the specific  xxxg1401xxx  and sucrase activities, compared with diabetic mice on standard laboratory diet. feeding with 75 mg acarbose mixed in 100 g standard laboratory chow caused a statistically significant decrease of  xxxg1401xxx  in the duodenum and of sucrase in duodenum and jejunum, without a antihyperglycaemic effect. feeding with 100 or 150 mg caused statistically significant decreases in specific  xxxg1401xxx  and sucrase activities in duodenum, jejunum and ileum. an antihyperglycaemic effect was observed only in the group of diabetic mice fed with 100 mg acarbose. this indicates that the antihyperglycaemic effect of acarbose involves factors other than these, related only to its inhibitory effect on disaccharidase activities.
