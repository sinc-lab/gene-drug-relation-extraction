clinical evidence is accumulating for the efficacy of adding inhaled
long-acting ␤2-agonists (labas) to corticosteroids in asthma. corticosteroids bind to cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors (grs),
which then translocate to the nucleus where they regulate gene
expression. this article reports the first evidence in vivo of an interaction between inhaled laba and corticosteroid on gr nuclear translocation in human airway cells using immunocytochemistry. we
initially demonstrated significant gr activation 60 minutes after
inhalation of 800 ␮g  xxxd294xxx  in six healthy
subjects. subsequently, we determined the effects of salmeterol
and  xxxd2145xxx  (fp) in seven steroid-naive patients with
asthma. we observed dose-dependent gr activation with 100- and
500-␮g doses of fp, and to a lesser extent with 50 ␮g salmeterol
alone. however, combination therapy with 100 ␮g fp and salmeterol augmented the action of fp on gr nuclear localization. in vitro,
salmeterol enhanced fp effects on gr nuclear translocation in epithelial and macrophage-like airway cell lines. in addition, salmeterol
in combination with fp enhanced glucocorticoid response element
(gre)–luciferase reporter gene activity and  xxxg664xxx  ( xxxg664xxx ) and secretory leuko-proteinase
inhibitor (slpi) gene induction. together, our data confirm that gr
nuclear translocation may underlie the complementary interactions
between labas and corticosteroids, although the precise signal
transduction mechanisms remain to be determined.

corticosteroids are potent antiinflammatory drugs that are
highly effective in the control of chronic inflammatory diseases
such as asthma, where they have become the mainstay of therapy
(1). glucocorticoid receptors (grs) are specific cytoplasmic
transcription factors that mediate the biological actions of corticosteroids (2). on ligand binding, gr translocates into the nucleus and  xxxd3249xxx  at glucocorticoid response elements
(gres) in the promoter region of corticosteroid-responsive genes
that induce transcription (3). gr activation may also influence
antiinflammatory events by nongenomic pathways, forming inhibitory interactions within the nucleus with proinflammatory
dna-binding transcription factors, such as activator protein
(ap)-1 or nuclear factor (nf)–␬b, or by recruitment of corepressors, and thereby repressing the actions of these important inflammatory proteins (4, 5). gr nuclear translocation is, therefore,
essential and necessary for corticosteroid action.
several clinical studies have shown that the combination of
a long-acting ␤2-agonist (laba) with a low dose of inhaled
corticosteroid achieves better asthma control than either drug

alone, or a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroid (6–11). patients
have improved lung function (9), better symptom control (6, 7),
reduction of exacerbations (10), and improvement in health status (11). together, labas and corticosteroids have complementary modes of action targeting different aspects of the underlying
pathophysiology of asthma, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be fully elucidated (12, 13).
labas have recently been shown to induce ligand-independent activation of gr nuclear translocation in vitro (14). using
primary human lung fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle
cells, eickelberg and colleagues (14) found that dexamethasone
and  xxxd2145xxx  (fp; 10⫺9 m) induced almost complete nuclear translocation of gr. importantly, it was observed
that salmeterol (10⫺8 m) was able to cause ligand-independent
gr translocation, although to a lesser extent than fp. similar
results have been achieved in cultured primary human bronchial
airway smooth muscle cells (15). in a pilot in vivo study, four
patients with asthma separately inhaled a single dose of budesonide (800 ␮g) and  xxxd2155xxx  (48 ␮g), and gr expression in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells was analyzed using immunoblots (16).  xxxd2155xxx  was able to cause gr activation, albeit
to a lesser degree and at a later time point compared with inhaled
budesonide.
this led us to investigate these complementary effects in vivo,
in cells relevant to the acute inflammation of asthma. in this
study, we tested the effect of combination treatment, on the
intracellular partitioning of gr in cells isolated from induced
sputum of patients with asthma. we performed immunocytochemical and western blot analysis of gr expression and subcellular localization. our aims were to determine whether gr
activation occurred in vivo after clinically relevant inhaled drug
concentrations, and to identify if the laba salmeterol was able
to modulate gr nuclear translocation.

methods
subjects
in the first clinical study, six healthy nonsmoking subjects (mean age
[sd], 31.8 ⫾ 7.0 years; 6 women; mean fev1 [sd], 2.84 ⫾ 0.66 l;
percentage predicted fev1, 108.7%) inhaled a single 800-␮g dose of
 xxxd294xxx  (bdp) from a metered dose inhaler and
spacer, on four study visits separated by a minimum washout period
of 6 days. at each visit, sputum was induced either at 0, 30, 60, or 120
minutes in a randomized sequence after inhalation of bdp to determine
a time-course for gr nuclear translocation. the second clinical study
was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design,
in which seven steroid-naive patients with mild asthma, defined according to the american thoracic society criteria (17), participated
(mean age [sd], 34.0 ⫾ 7.3 years; 4 women; mean fev1 [sd], 2.99 ⫾
0.97 l; percentage predicted fev1, 87.5%). single metered dose inhaler
doses of 100 ␮g fp, 500 ␮g fp, 50 ␮g salmeterol, 100 ␮g/50 ␮g combination fp/salmeterol (seretide; glaxosmithkline, greenford, uk), and placebo dummy inhaler were delivered via a spacer at separate visits, with
a minimum washout period of 7 days. for each treatment, sputum was
induced at 60 and 120 minutes postinhalation on separate visits. subjects
were required to have a baseline fev1 within 15% of their screening
fev1 value to control for differences in airway function and inflamma-

tion between visits. both studies were approved by the ethics committee of the royal brompton and harefield hospitals national health
service trust, and all subjects gave written, informed consent.

sputum induction and processing
sputum induction was performed exactly as previously described (18),
and samples were kept on ice and processed within 1 hour of collection.
total cell count (kimura stain) and viability (trypan blue exclusion)
were determined before cytospins were undertaken (18). cytospins
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde ( xxxg257xxx  ltd., poole, uk) and
stored at –20⬚c. samples with a cell viability of greater than 70% and
less than 30% squamous cell contamination were considered adequate.

immunoalkaline phosphatase staining
indirect staining of sputum cells was performed using the alkaline phosphatase–anti-alkaline phosphatase (apaap) method using a commercial kit (vectastain laboratories, peterborough, uk) (19). cells were
permeabilized for 10 minutes with 0.5% nonidet p-40 (np-40;  xxxg257xxx 
ltd.) and blocked in 20% normal swine nonimmune serum (dako ltd.,
cambridge, uk) for 30 minutes at room temperature. gr was detected
with polyclonal antirabbit antibody (1:100; santa cruz biotechnology,
inc., santa cruz, ca). after incubating with the secondary biotinylated
goat antirabbit antibody (1:100; vectastain laboratories), the immunoreaction was detected using the apaap system to produce red staining.
slides were counterstained with hematoxylin for cellular identification,
and examined under both modalities of light and fluorescent microscopy
(olympus optical co. ltd., london, uk; soft imaging system gmbh,
munster, germany). the advantage of the apaap complex is that
the red precipitate observed under the light microscope will also immunofluoresce red when viewed under a red fluorescent microscopic filter.
immunoreactive cells from induced sputum were each resolved at the
single-cell level by dual light and fluorescent microscopy to determine
the subcellular localization of gr. we used methods that others have
previously demonstrated in vitro that allow semiquantification of the
changes in the intracellular distribution of gr over time (20). immunopositive cells on sputum cytospins were classified into two categories
according to whether the signal intensity was predominately localized
to the cytoplasm (cytoplasmic gr) or distributed between both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments reflecting translocation of activated
gr (nuclear gr). no cells exclusively localized gr to the cytoplasm
or nucleus alone. an experienced observer blind to the clinical characteristics of the subject performed cell counting on 300 cells within each
cell population.

confocal laser immunofluorescence staining
separate cytospin preparations were used to detail the magnitude of
difference in gr subcellular localization using confocal laser imaging
of indirect fluorescent-labeled slides, but were not used in the count
analysis. using a modification of a method previously described (21),
cells were permeabilized, blocked, and then incubated with gr antibody for 1 hour at room temperature. after three washes in phosphatebuffered saline (pbs), cells were incubated with tetrarhodamine
isothiocyanate–conjugated goat antirabbit antibody (dako ltd.). cytospins were counterstained with 4⬘, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (dapi), a fluorescent blue nuclear indole chromatin stain,
and mounted in pbs:glycerol (50:50). the immunopositive signal was
characterized using laser scanning confocal microscopy on a leica tcs
nt/sp interactive laser cytometer equipped with confocal optics (leica
microsystems, wetzlar, germany). to determine the specificity of the
antibody, rabbit serum immunoglobulin (dako ltd.) and pbs were used
as isotype negative controls for immunocytochemistry (immunoalkaline
phosphatase) and confocal laser images.

isolation of cytosolic and nuclear fractions
and western blot analysis
nuclear and cytosolic fractions of cells were isolated as previously
described (22), and western blot analysis performed (5). for in vivo
sputum protein analysis, membranes were washed and incubated with
anti–gr-specific monoclonal antibody (becton dickinson biosciences,
oxford, uk) followed by an alkaline phosphatase–conjugated secondary antibody (invitrogen ltd., paisley, uk). for in vitro cell line experi-

705

ments, membranes were washed and incubated with polyclonal gr
antibody (santa cruz biotechnology, inc.) followed by horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody (dako ltd.). bound antibodies were visualized by use of the enhanced chemiluminescence (ecl)
system (amersham biosciences, little chalfont, uk). the membranes
were reprobed with anti– xxxg1361xxx 
(mek-1) and/or antihistone h1 antibodies (santa cruz biotechnology,
inc.) to confirm equal cytoplasmic and nuclear protein loading, respectively.

transfection and luciferase assays
cells (beas-2b and u937) were cultured according to the supplier’s
instructions (american type culture collection, rockville, md) until
90% confluent. cells were transiently transfected with a 2 ⫻ greluciferase and psv-␤-galactosidase (promega corp., madison, wi)
using lipofectamine, as previously described (22). eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with salmeterol (10⫺7 m) and/or with fp (10⫺8
or 10⫺12 m) for a further 8 hours, and luciferase and ␤-galactosidase
activity were measured (22). luciferase values were divided by galactosidase values to normalize for variations in transfection efficiency.

reverse transcription–real-time polymerase chain reaction
cells were treated with salmeterol (10⫺7 m) and/or with fp (10⫺8 or
10⫺12 m) for 2 hours, and 1 ⫻ 106 cells/treatment were harvested for
total rna isolation. commercially available kits were used to extract
total cellular rna (rneasy; qiagene, crawley, uk) and to perform
reverse transcription (omniscript rt; qiagene). gene transcript level
of  xxxg664xxx  ( xxxg664xxx /cl-100)
and the housekeeping gene  xxxg861xxx  (glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase) were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction
using a quantitect sybr green polymerase chain reaction kit (qiagene)
on a rotor-gene 3000 polymerase chain reaction apparatus (corbett
research, cambridge, uk). the primer pairs of  xxxg861xxx  and  xxxg664xxx 
were designed as previously described (23). variations in complementary dna (cdna) concentration between different samples were corrected using the housekeeping gene, where the  xxxg861xxx  concentration
in each cdna sample was calculated, and the cdna diluted to contain
equal amounts of  xxxg861xxx . standard curves for  xxxg861xxx  were generated by performing a dilution series of the untreated control cdna.
the relative amount of gene transcript present after different treatments
was calculated and normalized by dividing the calculated value for the
gene of interest by the housekeeping gene value.

statistical analysis
data are expressed as mean ⫾ sem. because sputum cells are not
normally distributed, nonparametric statistical analyses were performed
using the pc analysis package spss 10.0 (spss, inc., chicago, il).
results were analyzed using friedman analysis of variance, and comparisons between time points were made using the wilcoxon matchedpairs signed rank sum test. the difference between treatment groups
in the in vitro data was analyzed by welch’s t test using graph pad
prism software (graph pad prism, san diego, ca). a p value less than
0.05 was considered statistically significant.

characterization of gr nuclear and cytoplasmic staining
in sputum cells

in initial studies, immunoreactive cells from induced sputum
were each resolved at the single-cell level by dual light and
fluorescent microscopy to determine the subcellular localization
of gr in both epithelial cells and macrophages (figure 1). in
subsequent analysis, the immunopositive signal was characterized using laser scanning confocal microscopy in epithelial cells
(figure 2) and macrophages (figure 3). in all cases, the green
background autofluorescence is low and the blue dapi staining
outlines the nuclear boundary, and helps define the distribution
of gr protein (red) within the respective subcellular compartments. finally, the specificity of the antibody used was determined using an isotype control, which gave no staining (figures

the first clinical study investigated the time course of gr redistribution in cells from induced sputum after therapeutic concentrations of inhaled corticosteroid to determine the optimal time
point for gr translocation (figure 5). healthy subjects were
used to avoid confounding effects of disease or medication. all
cells in sputum (macrophages, epithelial cells, neutrophils, and
eosinophils) expressed gr protein, which confirms the ubiquitous expression of gr in airway cells (24). gr depletion from

the cytoplasm was associated with a corresponding increase in
gr accumulation into the nucleus. at baseline, approximately
30% of gr was localized to the nucleus in all cell types. we
found a significant increase in nuclear translocation (73 ⫾ 8%)
in macrophages 30 minutes after bdp inhalation, which was

4a and 4c) compared with that seen with the anti-gr antibody
(figures 4b and 4d) using both light microscopic and confocal

epithelial cells, this effect occurred at 60 minutes, with 71 ⫾ 3%
gr nuclear localization (p ⬍ 0.05; figure 5b). there was no
significant difference in the response of neutrophils when compared with baseline values. neutrophils were relatively corticosteroid insensitive when gr translocation was used as a marker

having determined the optimum time point for in vivo gr
activation as 60 minutes after corticosteroid inhalation, we studied the effect of a combination of inhaled laba and corticosteroid on gr nuclear translocation and expression in subjects with
asthma, using corticosteroid as the positive control. macrophages and epithelial cells were studied, because the remaining
cellular counts are low in patients with asthma (25). in keeping
with data in our healthy subjects, after placebo inhalation, approximately 30% of gr was localized to the nuclear compartment in both cell types (figures 6a and 6b). in epithelial cells,
we observed a clear dose-dependent increase in gr nuclear
translocation with 100 ␮g fp and 500 ␮g fp (45 ⫾ 2.2 vs. 64 ⫾
1.6% positively stained nuclei, p ⬍ 0.05). the effects of both
doses of fp were significant compared with placebo (figure 6a;
p ⬍ 0.05). salmeterol (50 ␮g) alone significantly induced gr
nuclear translocation in sputum epithelial cells (38 ⫾ 2.2%)
compared with placebo (p ⬍ 0.05), and furthermore, in combination with 100 ␮g fp, salmeterol was able to significantly enhance
gr intracellular partitioning by fp (57 ⫾ 1.9%) to a greater
extent than either drug alone (p ⬍ 0.05; figure 6a). similar
results were seen with sputum macrophages (figure 6b).
immunoblots on pooled sputum samples confirmed the magnitude of the cellular response within the nuclear compartment
(figure 7). the results were consistent with the immunocytochemistry data and showed a clear dose–response relationship
to fp with respect to gr nuclear translocation after 60 minutes.
in addition, the results showed a lesser effect of salmeterol alone
on gr activation, but when salmeterol was combined with fp,
there was enhanced gr nuclear translocation compared with
low-dose fp alone, reaching a similar level as that seen with
500 ␮g fp (figure 7). because of the short time course of study

expression from these same cells using reverse transcription–
polymerase chain reaction.
gr nuclear translocation after combination therapy in vitro

to corroborate the in vivo data from airway cells on gr nuclear
translocation, the effect of fp and salmeterol both singly and
in combination were studied in an in vitro epithelial and macrophage-like cell line model, beas-2b and phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx 
13-acetate (pma)-treated u-937 cells, respectively (figure 8).
fp (10⫺12, 10⫺8 m) induced gr nuclear translocation in a concentration-dependent manner both in pma-treated u-937 and
beas-2b cells. salmeterol in combination with fp (10⫺12 m)
significantly enhanced fp-induced gr nuclear translocation
compared with fp (10⫺12 m) alone in both cell lines (p ⬍ 0.05).
there was no significant difference in gr nuclear translocation
between the high concentration of fp and low-concentration
combination treatment. concurrently, salmeterol enhanced fpinduced gr reduction from the cytoplasm in both cell lines.

having confirmed the ability to induce nuclear gr translocation
in an in vitro model, we examined whether this translocation
was able to produce a functional readout. transient transfection
of the gre-dependent reporter,  xxxg2041xxx .2gre.luc, into pmatreated u-937 cells showed that fp (10⫺12, 10⫺8 m) activated
gre-dependent transcription in a concentration-dependent
manner (figure 9a). salmeterol (10⫺7 m) alone also activated
gre-dependent transcription, although this was not statistically
significant. however, in combination with low-concentration fp
(10⫺12 m), salmeterol significantly enhanced fp-dependent gre
transcription in both cell lines compared with fp (10⫺12 m) alone
(p ⬍ 0.05). similar results were obtained in beas-2b cells
(figure 9b).
 xxxg664xxx  expression in u-937 cells and slpi expression

finally, we determined whether salmeterol enhanced the glucocorticoid-genomic functional readout using the corticosteroidinducible genes  xxxg664xxx  and secretory leuko-proteinase inhibitor
(slpi) expression as readouts in pma-treated u-937 and
beas-2b cells, respectively. fp (10⫺12, 10⫺8 m) induced  xxxg664xxx 
mrna expression in pma-treated u-937 cells in a concentrationdependent manner (figure 10a). salmeterol in combination with
fp (10⫺12 m) significantly enhanced fp-induced  xxxg664xxx  mrna
expression compared with fp (10⫺12 m) alone (p ⬍ 0.05). fp also
induced slpi mrna expression in a concentration-dependent
manner compared with  xxxg861xxx  expression in beas-2b cells
(figure 10b). salmeterol (10⫺7 m) had no effect on slpi mrna
expression on its own, but significantly enhanced fp (10⫺12 m)induced slpi mrna expression in combination when compared
with fp (10⫺12 m) alone (p ⬍ 0.05).

discussion
this study evaluated the effects of inhaled combination therapy
using laba and corticosteroid on gr nuclear translocation in
airway cells isolated in vivo and in relevant cell lines in vitro.
we initially found that, after 800 ␮g of inhaled bdp in healthy
subjects, ligand-induced gr nuclear translocation occurred with
distinct kinetics in all cell types. this was not an all-or-nothing
event but rather resulted in redistribution of the dynamic balance
of gr between the subcellular compartments. we observed
significant gr nuclear translocation within 60 minutes of inhaled
corticosteroid therapy, and nuclear retention was maintained for
at least 2 hours. it is well established that inhaled corticosteroids
target the underlying inflammatory pathophysiology of asthma,
but most of their effect is obtained from low doses because there
is a relatively flat dose–response relationship (26). conversely,
there is the potential for dose-dependent systemic side effects
with higher doses. labas, on the other hand, principally relax
airway smooth muscle, resulting in prolonged bronchodilation

and bronchoprotection, but they have an independent action,
which complements the effects of corticosteroids. we demonstrated a significant increase in gr nuclear translocation in sputum epithelial cells and macrophages with salmeterol alone
compared with placebo, and furthermore, in combination with
fp, salmeterol was significantly better than low-dose fp alone
at enhancing gr nuclear translocation.

709

consistent with our in vivo data, we observed that salmeterol
was able to enhance low-dose fp effects on gr nuclear translocation in both epithelial and macrophage airway cell lines treated
in vitro. the magnitude and trend of the response in vitro was
comparable to that seen in vivo, and our results support those
of previous authors that show labas are able to promote gr
nuclear translocation in cultured fibroblasts and smooth muscle
cells (14, 15). taken together, our results are the first evidence
in vivo to demonstrate that the laba salmeterol, in combination with the corticosteroid fluitcasone propionate, at clinically
relevant inhaled concentrations in subjects with asthma, is able
to influence the intracellular partitioning of gr in both macrophages and epithelial airway cells to a greater extent than either
drug alone.
although nuclear translocation signifies that the drug is able
to reach the target cell at a sufficient concentration to promote
gr subcellular nuclear movement, it does not imply per se that
functional antiinflammatory events will follow. the final biological outcome of gr transcription factor modulation depends
on the net balance of both transactivation and transrepression
effects, and will differ between cells, and under different stimuli.
we therefore investigated the biological relevance of gr activation in vitro, and demonstrated that salmeterol modulation of
gr translocation had functional effects on gre-luciferase activity and  xxxg664xxx  and slp1 gene induction. labas have been
shown previously to augment the antiinflammatory effects of
corticosteroids (13), particularly via inhibitory effects on cytokine release from a variety of cells involved in the pathogenesis
of asthma. korn and brattsand (27) observed the combination of
 xxxd2155xxx  and budesonide inhibited granulocyte-macrophage
colony–stimulating factor release from  xxxg2296xxx 
␣–stimulated human airway epithelial cells more than either drug
alone. similarly, pang and knox reported that salmeterol enhanced
the inhibitory actions of fp on  xxxg2296xxx  ␣–induced
 xxxg562xxx  (28) and  xxxg354xxx  (29) release from human airway
smooth muscle cells. we chose to examine the ability of fp to
induce gr-gre dna binding, and induce antiinflammatory

genes such as slpi and the dual mitogen-activating protein
kinase inhibitor  xxxg664xxx . we found that salmeterol was able to
augment the ability of fp to enhance both gr-gre binding
and slpi and  xxxg664xxx  expression in both macrophage-like and
epithelial cell lines. the effect was at least additive and clearly
synergistic with respect to slpi induction in beas-2b cells.
the effects on gr-gre activation and gene expression were
not totally superimposable due to the more complex promoter
structure of the native  xxxg664xxx  and slpi promoters and the
requirement for other factors for full gene expression.
in vivo studies using bronchial biopsies generate further supporting evidence for complementary interactions on airway inflammation and pathology in subjects with asthma. li and
colleagues (30) found the addition of salmeterol in patients receiving inhaled corticosteroid led to a reduction in the total
number of activated eosinophils within the lamina propria, together with a concurrent improvement in clinical status. orsida
and coworkers (31) demonstrated a significant reduction in the
vascularity of the lamina propria in patients with asthma receiving salmeterol and inhaled corticosteroid, whereas no effect was
observed after high-dose inhaled corticosteroid treatment. we
used established noninvasive techniques of sputum induction to
obtain airway cellular samples to investigate the interaction of
inhaled laba and corticosteroid in human subjects. we applied
immunocytochemistry techniques to investigate the subcellular
localization of gr in a semiquantitative manner similar to that
described by previous authors in vitro (20). although bronchoscopy with airway brushing may have provided sufficient cellular
material to undertake quantitative protein analysis, it would not
have been ethical to undertake this invasive procedure on the
number of occasions outlined in our study design. in vitro experiments clearly demonstrate that these effects of laba on corticosteroid actions are mediated through the ␤2-receptor (14,
27–29). however, this has not been formally shown in this study
in vivo due to the prolonged time required to examine cytokine

profiles such as  xxxg1181xxx  or granulocyte-macrophage colony–
stimulating factor (32), and the potential risk of giving subjects
with asthma ␤-blockers. studies examining the effect of chronic
combination treatment on cytokine profiles released from airway
cells in vivo will need to be performed to address, in part, these
issues.
grs are phosphoproteins (33) and altered phosphorylation
of gr and components of its signal transduction pathway have
been implicated in the regulation of corticosteroid binding to
gr (34), gr subcellular localization (35), and gr nuclear cytoplasmic trafficking through the nuclear pore complex (36, 37).
receptor phosphorylation may also influence the interactions
of gr with other transcription factors, such as nf-␬b, required
for transactivation (38). many of the kinases that catalyze the
phosphorylation of gr have been identified (39) and mitogenactivated protein kinase–dependent phosphorylation may play
a role (40). interestingly, phosphorylation of inactive gr may
block subsequent hormone binding and nuclear translocation
(41). labas may prime gr for activation directly by kinasedependent phosphorylation and this may account for the additional effects of laba on corticosteroid effects on nf-␬b (42).
we postulate that phosphorylation of gr and its change in
protein structure may alter function such that there are more
enhanced responses to combination treatment.
in vitro experiments show that gr is entirely localized to
the cytoplasm before corticosteroid treatment (43). however,
we observed basal nuclear gr translocation of approximately
30% within airway cells in both healthy subjects and in subjects
with asthma, which may reflect responses to endogenous levels
of circulating cortisol. this may also account, at least in part,
for the effect seen with salmeterol alone in vivo. although not
a primary aspect of our study, we found a degree of corticosteroid
insensitivity to gr nuclear translocation within neutrophils. glucocorticoid sensitivity varies between cell types and on the stage

usmani, ito, maneechotesuwan, et al.: ␤-agonists and gr nuclear translocation

of the cell cycle (24, 44) and often parallels changes in receptor
density (45, 46), and low gr levels have been associated with
a poor response to corticosteroid treatment (45, 47). decreased
gr sensitivity of neutrophils to corticosteroids has been shown
in vitro (48), and this has been postulated to be the result of
enhanced gr␤ expression (49). the differential response of the
cells to inhaled corticosteroids observed within our healthy volunteers suggests that the decreased sensitivity of neutrophils to glucocorticoids may also be due to reduced gr nuclear translocation.
in conclusion, our data show that salmeterol, in combination
with  xxxd2145xxx , can enhance gr nuclear translocation in vivo, as well as in vitro, and the data suggest that salmeterol may play an important role in the additional benefits seen
with combination therapy. in vitro, the enhanced gr nuclear
translocation is associated with an amplified gr functional response. further studies are needed to address whether these
differences are maintained after chronic treatment with inhaled
laba and corticosteroids, and whether this results in an alteration in cytokine profiles in vivo.
