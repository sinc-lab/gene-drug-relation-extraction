abstract
increasing attention is being given to the role of neurotransmitters and other signaling substances in the damage induced by
intense sound to the cochlea.  xxxd83xxx  (atp) is one example of a putative neurotransmitter that may alter cochlear
mechanics during sound exposure. the purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that endogenous extracellular atp
has a role in the generation of the changes in cochlear mechanics induced by moderate intense sound exposure. guinea pigs were
exposed to either: (1) a perilymphatic administration of pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2p,4p-disulphonic acid (ppads, 1 mm),
an atp antagonist; (2) a moderately intense sound (6 khz tone, 95 db  xxxg2064xxx , 15 min); or (3) a combination of the ppads and the
sound. the effects on the cubic distortion product otoacoustic emissions (dpoaes;  xxxg2127xxx  3f2 ) were monitored using three sets of equal
level primaries (f1 = 9.25 khz, f2 = 10.8 khz,  xxxg2127xxx  3f2 = 7.7 khz; f1 = 7.2 khz, f2 = 8.4 khz,  xxxg2127xxx  3f2 = 6 khz; f1 = 5.55 khz, f2 = 6.5 khz,
 xxxg2127xxx  3f2 = 4.6 khz). ppads alone had no effect on the cubic dpoaes monitored. the intense sound alone suppressed all three cubic
dpoaes. the combination of ppads with the intense sound induced a suppression of the cubic dpoaes that was equal to or
greater than induced by the intense sound alone at f2 = 10.8 khz but was equal to or less than induced by the intense sound at f2 = 8.4
and 6.5 khz. after washing the ppads out of the cochlea with artificial perilymph, all three cubic dpoaes were suppressed less in
the ppads with intense sound treatment group than in the intense sound alone group. the ppads appeared to provide protection
from the intense sound. results are consistent with the hypothesis that extracellular atp is involved in the changes in cochlear
mechanics induced by moderately intense sound exposure. ß 2001 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
damage to the cochlea by intense sound involves a
complex series of events initiated either by mechanical
or chemical triggers (altschuler et al., 1999; lim and
melnick, 1971; nordmann et al., 2000; slepecky, 1986).
recently attention has been given to the role of neurotransmitters and other signaling substances in this pro-

cess (bobbin, 1992 ; keithley et al., 1998 ; puel, 1995;
puel et al., 1998). at the inner hair cells (ihcs) the
a¡erent neurotransmitter glutamate has been shown
to induce swelling and destruction of the dendrites of
the primary auditory nerve ¢bers (ruel et al., 1999,
2000). this `glutamate toxicity' appears to explain
some of the phenomena called temporary threshold
shift (puel et al., 1998). at the e¡erent nerve ¢ber synapses on the outer hair cells (ohcs) the neurotransmitter acetylcholine has been shown to lessen the damage
induced by intense sound (see review by liberman and
kujawa, 1999).
 xxxd83xxx  (atp) is a putative neurotransmitter in the cochlea that may have a role during
intense sound exposure, although the exact role of
extracellular atp in the cochlea remains to be de¢ned

activation of atp receptors on various cells in the
organ of corti has been demonstrated to evoke large
net inward cation currents (bobbin et al., 1998, 2000a).
in addition to suppressing some cochlear potentials,
both  xxxg1643xxx   xxxg1644xxx   xxxg1646xxx  agonists (bobbin and thompson,
1978 ; kujawa et al., 1994a) and  xxxg1643xxx   xxxg1644xxx   xxxg1646xxx  antagonists (kujawa et al., 1994b; skellett et al., 1997; chen
et al., 1998) placed in perilymph change the magnitude
of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (dpoaes)
re£ecting an alteration in the mechanical motion of the
cochlear partition (mills, 1998; kemp, 1998). large
concentrations of atp introduced into the perilymph
compartment have been demonstrated to be toxic to the
cells of the cochlea and to induce proliferation of ¢brocytes (bobbin et al., 1997). thus it appears that atp
may be an important neurotransmitter in the cochlea
that can induce cell death if it is released into the extracellular space in large concentrations during intense
sound exposure.
acute exposure to a moderately intense sound (i.e. 95
db  xxxg2064xxx ) selectively alters the cochlear ampli¢er (puel et
al., 1988) and cochlear mechanics as monitored with
dpoaes (puel et al., 1995). there is some evidence
that the function of the stereocilia on the ohcs is the
primary site of damage under these exposure conditions
(yoshida and liberman, 1999; saunders et al., 1985).
previously, we tested the hypothesis that endogenous
extracellular atp is involved in either enhancing or
lessening the e¡ects of a moderately intense sound exposure on the cochlea (leblanc and bobbin, 1999). the
perilymphatic administration of pyridoxal-phosphate-6azophenyl-2p,4p-disulphonic acid (ppads), an atp antagonist, was combined with acute moderately intense
sound exposure and the e¡ects on sound-evoked cochlear potentials monitored. the results were di¤cult to
interpret probably because of the extensive cellular locations of atp receptors in the cochlea (bobbin et al.,
2000a,b) and the complex nature of cochlear potential
generation and recording. since dpoaes are a more
direct re£ection of cochlear mechanics than some cochlear potentials, dpoaes may be a more direct monitor of the role of endogenous atp during moderate
intense sound exposure. therefore, in the present study
the e¡ects of perilymphatic administration of ppads
on the suppression of cubic dpoaes ( xxxg2127xxx  3f2 ) by a
moderately intense sound were monitored in guinea
pigs.
2. materials and methods
2.1. subjects
experiments were performed on pigmented guinea

11

pigs of either sex weighing between 250 and 400 g.
anesthetized animals (urethane, sigma; 1.5 g/kg, intraperitoneal) were tracheotomized and were allowed to
breathe unassisted. the electrocardiogram was monitored throughout each experiment and rectal temperature was maintained at 38 þ 1³c by a heating pad.
additional urethane was administered as required to
maintain an adequate depth of anesthesia as monitored
by lack of withdrawal paw re£ex in response to deep
pressure applied to the paw. surgical procedures have
been described previously (kujawa et al., 1994a,b). in
all animals the right auditory bulla was exposed using a
ventrolateral approach and tendons of the right middle
ear muscles were sectioned.
2.2. cochlear perfusion experiments
perfusions were carried out using methods described
previously (kujawa et al., 1994a,b). the arti¢cial perilymph (ap) had a composition of (in mm): nacl, 137;
kcl, 5; cacl2 , 2; nah2 po4 , 1; mgcl2 , 1; glucose, 11;
nahco3 , 12. the ppads was dissolved in the ap on
the day of use. all solutions had a ph of 7.4 and an
osmolality of 303 mosmol. perfusates were introduced
into the cochlear perilymph at room temperature (24³c)
and at a rate of 2.5 wl/min through a hole made in basal
turn scala tympani and were allowed to £ow from the
cochlea through an e¥uent hole placed in basal turn
scala vestibuli. e¥uent was absorbed within the bulla
using small cotton wicks.
2.3. recording of dpoaes
methods used to elicit and monitor dpoaes were
essentially as described previously (skellett et al., 1997;
chen et al., 1998). cubic ( xxxg2127xxx  3f2 = 7.7 khz, f1 = 9.25
khz, f2 = 10.8 khz ; 6 khz, f1 = 7.2 khz, f2 = 8.4 khz;
and 4.6 khz, f1 = 5.55 khz, f2 = 6.5 khz) dpoaes were
elicited by equal level primary signals (f1 and f2 ) that
were generated by tucker davis system ii hardware
plus to two er-2 speakers (entymotic research), and
then delivered to the right ear canal by an acoustic
probe assembly that contained a microphone (entymotic research, er-10b). with the probe assembly
coupled tightly to the ear canal, tones delivered by
the speakers elicited dpoaes that in turn were detected by the probe's microphone. the signal detected
by the microphone was ampli¢ed (entymotic research,
er-1072) and delivered to a dynamic signal analyzer
(hewlett packard, 35106a) for fast fourier transform
analysis (averaging 10 spectra) and display of the cubic
dpoae (cf = dpoae; span = 1 khz ; bw = 3.75 hz).
the noise £oors associated with this display window
ranged from 315 to 320 db  xxxg2064xxx . amplitude growth
functions for the cubic dpoaes were obtained by pre-

heares 3676 17-5-01

senting a range of equal level primary tones (70^20 db
 xxxg2064xxx  in 5 db  xxxg2064xxx  steps). the dpoae in the text refers
to the frequency of the f2 primary used to evoke the
cubic dpoae since there is some evidence that the
cubic dpoae re£ects cochlear partition activity at
that f2 place (puel et al., 1995).
2.4. paradigm for drug delivery and intense sound
exposure
the paradigm for intense sound delivery and drug
delivery was similar to that used by us previously (see
¢gure 1 in puel et al., 1988; leblanc and bobbin,
1999). three treatment groups were tested : an intense
sound group (n = 5 animals); a ppads group (n = 5
animals) ; and a ppads plus intense sound group
(n = 5 animals).
in all animals, the cochlea was ¢rst perfused with ap
for one or two 20 min perfusion periods (called the ap
period) to ensure a stable base line as monitored by
dpoae amplitude after each perfusion period. all animals used in the study had dpoae amplitude values
that were stable and within laboratory norms during
this control period. the cochlea was then perfused
with ap (with or without drug) continuously for a period of 35 min called the treatment period. during the
¢rst 10 min of the 35 min treatment period the animal
was exposed to silence. then at the 10 min point in the
treatment period, and as the perfusion continued, the
cochlea was exposed to silence or to the intense sound
(6 khz, 95 db  xxxg2064xxx ) for 15 min. then at the 25 min
point in the treatment period, the intense sound exposure was terminated and the animal was exposed to
silence for an additional 10 min as the perfusion with
ap (with or without drug) was continued. following
this 35 min treatment period the perilymph compartment was perfused (washed) with ap without drug
for a 20 min perfusion period (called the wash period).
immediately (within 2 min) following the termination of
each perfusion, dpoaes evoked by the primaries were
recorded.
in summary, the intense sound group was perfused
with ap only during the 35 min treatment period and
exposed to the 6 khz, 95 db  xxxg2064xxx  tone for 15 min
during the 35 min treatment period. the ppads group
was perfused with 1 mm ppads during the 35 min
treatment period and was not exposed to the intense
sound. the ppads plus intense sound group was
perfused with 1 mm ppads during the 35 min treatment period and was exposed to the 6 khz, 95 db
 xxxg2064xxx  tone for 15 min during the 35 min treatment
period. data displayed show the dpoaes recorded:
after the last 20 min perfusion with ap used to obtain a stable base line (called ap); after the 35 min
treatment period of perfusion (called treatment); and

after the ¢nal 20 min perfusion of wash with ap (called
wash).
it is known that some treatments a¡ect the low intensity portions and others a¡ect the high intensity portions of the dpoae intensity functions (e.g. salicylate
kujawa et al., 1992). therefore, to quantify the e¡ects
of the treatments, statistical tests were carried out on
dpoae data evoked by one intensity from each of
these areas, 55 and 70 db  xxxg2064xxx , respectively. e¡ects of
treatments were quanti¢ed using a repeated measures
analysis of variance (anova) and student newman
keuls multiple range test (signi¢cance, p 6 0.05). responses that fell into the noise £oor were assigned the
numerical value of the noise £oor. only the data obtained at these two intensities are shown. the ppads
was purchased from research biochemicals international (cat. no. p-178) and was used the same day
that it was placed into solution. the care and use of
the animals reported on in this study were approved by
lsumc's institutional animal care and use committee.
3. results
3.1. e¡ects of ppads on cubic dpoaes
the e¡ects of 1 mm ppads perfused through the
perilymph compartment for 35 min were similar to
those described earlier for 1 mm ppsds in a cumulative dose response study by chen et al. (1998). ppads
produced no signi¢cant e¡ect on the cubic dpoae at
f2 = 10.8 khz, 8.4 khz or 6.5 khz, however, for an
undetermined reason the wash value was signi¢cantly
larger than the ap value at 55 db  xxxg2064xxx  for f2 = 8.4
khz (figs. 1a,b, 2a,b and 3a,b).
3.2. e¡ects of the intense sound on cubic dpoaes
the e¡ects of the intense sound (6 khz, 95 db  xxxg2064xxx ,
15 min) on the cubic dpoaes were essentially as described previously by puel et al. (1995) for a 6 khz, 95
db  xxxg2064xxx , 15 min tone exposure. at both 55 and 70 db
 xxxg2064xxx  primaries the intense sound produced a signi¢cant
reduction in the magnitude of the cubic dpoae
evoked at f2 = 10.8 khz, 8.4 khz and 6.5 khz (figs.
1a,b, 2a,b and 3a,b). the magnitudes of the three
cubic dpoaes after the wash period did not change
from the magnitudes following the treatment period.
consistent with the ¢ndings of puel et al. (1995) the
largest change occurred one half of an octave above
the intense sound frequency at f2 = 8.4 khz (22 db
change at 55 db) and less of a change occurred at
f2 = 10.8 khz (13 db change at 55 db) and at f2 = 6.5
khz (10 db change at 55 db).

3.3. e¡ects of ppads plus intense sound
the combination of 1 mm ppads with the intense
sound exposure a¡ected the cubic dpoaes at each of
the three f2 frequencies di¡erently. at the high frequency (f2 = 10.8 khz), comparing the treatment value
of the combination to the treatment value in the intense
sound group, the combination resulted in a signi¢cantly
greater reduction in the dpoae at the 70 db  xxxg2064xxx 
primary level and in no di¡erence at the 55 db  xxxg2064xxx 
primary level (fig. 1a,b). after washing out the drug
there was a signi¢cant degree of recovery to the point
that the intense sound demonstrated no signi¢cant effect on dpoae magnitude at either level, indicating
complete protection or recovery from the e¡ects of
the intense sound (fig. 1a,b).
at the low frequency (f2 = 6.5 khz), comparing the
treatment value of the combination to the treatment
value in the intense sound group, the combination resulted in signi¢cantly less reduction in the dpoae at
the 55 db  xxxg2064xxx  primary level or the intense sound had
no signi¢cant e¡ect in the presence of the drug. at the
70 db  xxxg2064xxx  primary level the treatment value of the
combination was the same as the treatment value in
the intense sound group (fig. 3a,b). at this 70 db
 xxxg2064xxx  primary level in the combination treatment group

evoked by equal level primaries (l1 = l2 = 70 db  xxxg2064xxx  (a);

the wash value was not di¡erent from the ap value,
indicating that there was recovery of the dpoae after
washing out the drug and a complete protection or
recovery from the e¡ects of the intense sound (fig.
1a,b).
at the frequency a¡ected to the largest extent by the
intense sound (f2 = 8.4 khz), comparing the treatment
values of the combination to treatment values of the
intense sound group, the combination resulted in signi¢cantly less reduction in the cubic dpoae at both 55
and 70 db  xxxg2064xxx  primary levels (fig. 2a,b). however,
for both levels of primaries the degree of reduction
following the combination treatment was signi¢cant
compared to the ap values within the group and there
was no signi¢cant change in the values induced by
washing out the drug (fig. 2a,b).
4. discussion
the drug ppads blocks atp at p2x2 ionotropic
atp receptors in acutely isolated ohcs, deiters' cells,
hensen's cells and pillar cells and induces changes in
dpoaes and cochlear potentials (chen et al., 1998 ;
chen and bobbin, 1998). in the present study the results obtained indicate that ppads lessened the e¡ect
of an intense sound on cochlear mechanics as monitored by the cubic dpoaes after washing out the
drug. this is taken as evidence that endogenous atp
released into the extracellular compartment enhances
the deleterious e¡ects of the intense sound on cochlear
mechanics.
the results indicate that there was a complex interaction between the drug and the intense sound at an
area of the cochlear partition (f2 = 10.8 khz) located on
the high frequency side (proximal) of the maximally
damaged area (f2 = 8.4 khz). in the continued presence
of the drug (before wash) there was a potentiation of
the damage (at 70 db  xxxg2064xxx  primaries) or no e¡ect on the
damage (at 55 db  xxxg2064xxx  primaries) induced by the intense sound on the cubic dpoae magnitude at
f2 = 10.8 khz. washing out the drug reversed the e¡ect
and revealed a protection at both intensities. the protection but not the potentiation occurred at f2 = 8.4 khz
and f2 = 6.5 khz.
the reversible potentiation obtained at f2 = 10.8 khz
is similar to the results obtained with cochlear microphonics (cm) and n1 latency in the cochlear potential
study of leblanc and bobbin (1999). they observed
that in the continued presence of ppads the e¡ect of
the intense sound on cm and n1 latency was potentiated. the potentiation of low and moderate intensity
cm and n1 latency was reversed by washing out the
drug as was the e¡ect on the dpoae magnitude at
f2 = 10.8 khz. subsequent studies revealed that the

cm was recorded proximal to the area of maximal
damage (bobbin et al., 2000b). deatherage et al.
(1959) and others (bobbin et al., 2000b ; puel et al.,
1988) ascribe the increase in n1 latency induced by
intense sound to damage of the cochlear partition in
an area proximal to the area evoking the neural response. since in the leblanc and bobbin (1999) study
the n1 latency was evoked by a tone burst localized
close to the area of maximal damage, then the increase
in n1 latency may have indicated a potentiation of
damage at a proximal site. in summary studies of
cm, n1 latency and cubic dpoaes indicate that the
presence of ppads in the perilymph enhances the deleterious e¡ect of an intense sound on the proximal or
high frequency side of the cochlear partition damaged
by the intense sound and that the enhanced e¡ect is
reversed upon wash out of the drug. the cellular mechanisms for this reversible enhancement remain to be
explored.
in the leblanc and bobbin (1999) study a protection
from the e¡ects of a moderately intense sound by
ppads was not observed in the recordings of cm,
n1 latency, summating potential (sp) or the compound
action potential of the auditory nerve (cap). since cm
re£ects the activity of the ohcs and cochlear mechanics to some degree, the failure to detect a protection
with the cm appears to be inconsistent with the protection obtained in the present study with the cubic
dpoaes. this is explained by the fact that the cm
was recorded at a place so far basal ward on the cochlear partition from the area of damage that it was not
altered by the intense sound alone (see discussion in
bobbin et al., 2000b). also n1 latency was not a¡ected
by the exposure to the intense sound. puel et al. (1988)
had noted that n1 latency is not a¡ected by intense
sound when the area evoking the neural response is
identical to the area damaged maximally as it was in
the leblanc and bobbin (1999) study. future experiments will determine if cm recorded at the appropriate
site along the cochlear partition and n1 latency evoked
by the appropriate stimulus behave similar to the cubic
dpoaes in response to the intense sound and ppads.
the failure to detect a protection in the sp and cap
may have been due to the fact that the wash period
failed to completely reverse the ppads e¡ect on sp
and cap and the residual action of ppads may
have masked a protective e¡ect. alternatively, the results may indicate that the intense sound had e¡ects on
sites that were not protected by the ppads such as the
ihcs that generate the sp but not the dpoaes.
one premise of this study is that ppads blocks endogenous extracellular atp at atp receptors (chen et
al., 2000). one of the several possible sources for extracellular atp is the type ii a¡erent pathway. fechner et
al. (1998) suggest that branches of type ii a¡erent ¢bers

synapsing with ohcs may form one portion of the
outer supporting cell ¢bers (oscfs) that form synapses
with the deiters' cells. since there are a large number of
atp receptors on deiters' cells, then one source of
endogenous extracellular atp that could act on these
receptors may be the terminals of oscfs utilizing atp
as a neurotransmitter at synapses formed with deiters'
cells. these ¢bers may induce an alteration in the deiters' cells as sound levels change (chen et al., 1998;
bobbin et al., 1998, 2000a,b). activation of atp receptors has been demonstrated to evoke a large net inward
cation current in isolated deiters' cells (chen and bobbin, 1998). thus the actions of both  xxxg1643xxx   xxxg1644xxx   xxxg1646xxx  agonists (kujawa et al., 1994a) and  xxxg1643xxx   xxxg1644xxx   xxxg1646xxx  antagonists (kujawa et al., 1994b; skellett et al., 1997; chen
et al., 1998) on dpoaes may be due to an action at the
synapses formed by these nerve endings with deiters'
cells. future experiments will determine if the actions of
ppads in the present study were due to a blockade of
neurotransmitter atp at these oscf synapses with
deiters' cells.
the data presented here must be interpreted with
circumspection given the speci¢city of ppads in the
cochlea is not completely known. in addition to blocking atp at p2x2 ionotropic receptors the drug is
known to also block atp at some p2y metabotropic
receptors (charlton et al., 1996). also ppads has been
shown to inhibit the breakdown of atp by inhibition
of ectonucleotidases (ziganshin et al., 1995). receptors
for atp have been demonstrated on the stereocilia of
the ohcs (housley et al., 1992, 1999). however, it is
unlikely that the ppads placed in the perilymph compartment penetrated the perilymph/endolymph barrier
to act on the receptors on the stereocilia (leblanc
and bobbin, 1999). there is evidence that atp receptors on the stereocilia may be involved in the damage to
the cochlea by intense sound (chen et al., 1995) and
that they may be involved in stereocilia repair (watson,
2000).
in summary ppads, an atp antagonist, provided
protection from the e¡ects of a moderately intense
sound when cochlear mechanics were monitored with
cubic dpoaes after washing out the drug. these actions of ppads are interpreted as evidence for endogenous extracellular atp acting on atp receptors and
deleteriously a¡ecting cochlear mechanics during a
moderately intense sound exposure.
