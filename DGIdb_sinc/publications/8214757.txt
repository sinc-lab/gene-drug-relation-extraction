inbibition of plasma membrane ca*' -atpase
activity by volatile anesthetics

danuta kosk-kosicka, ph.d.,* grazyna roszczynska, m.s.t

background: the precise sites and mechanisms of action of
volatile anesthetics remain unknown. recently, several inte-
gral membrane proteins have been suggested as potential tar-
gets to which anesthetics can bind at hydrophobic regions.
impairment of cell ca?* homeostasis has been postulated as
one of the possible mechanisms of anesthetic action. to test
these hypotheses, the authors selected the human erythrocyte
ca?*-atpase as a model membrane protein. this enzyme is an
integral membrane protein that is instrumental in maintaining
ca** homeostasis in the cell in which it is the sole ca?*-trans-
porting system. thus, any functional alteration of the ca?*-
atpase by anesthetics may lead to serious perturbations in
ca**-regulated processes in the cell.

methods: the ca?*-atpase activity was measured as a func-
tion of increased concentration of four volatile anesthetics:
halothane, isoflurane,  xxxd1993xxx , and  xxxd1844xxx .

results: all four anesthetics significantly inhibited the ca**-
atpase activity in a dose-dependent manner. the half-maximal
inhibition occurred at anesthetic concentrations from 0.3 to
0.7 vol% at 37° c, which, except for  xxxd1844xxx , is a clinically
relevant concentration range. the greater the clinical potency
of the volatile anesthetics studied, the less was the concen-
tration required to inhibit the ca?*-atpase activity. the in-
hibition was less at 25° c than at 37° c, which is consistent
with direct interactions of the nonpolar interfaces of the en-
 xxxg1282xxx  with the nonpolar portions of the anesthetics.

conclusions: the authors’ findings indicate that the ca’*-
atpase is a suitable model for investigating the mechanism

the precise sites and mechanisms of action of volatile
anesthetics remain unknown. in recent years, several
observations have been published suggesting that gen-
eral anesthetics may act on specific hydrophobic sites
on protein molecules, rather than interact nonspecifi-
cally with membrane lipids.'~* it was possible to iden-
tify distinct anesthetic binding sites for several soluble
proteins, among them bovine  xxxg124xxx , lucifer-
ase, and protein kinase c.'"”# it is interesting that most
soluble proteins are not affected by anesthetics at con-
centrations that induce general anesthesia. some pro-
teins are inhibited by certain agents, but not by others,
indicating that general anesthetics selectively affect
certain proteins.’

the many theories developed to explain the mech-
anism of the action of anesthetics have a common
theme; 7.e., that the anesthetics alter some component
of the membrane, leading to altered function. thus, an
integral plasma membrane protein appears to be a
highly probable target for volatile anesthetics. some
integral membrane proteins, such as the acetylcholine
receptor-ionophore complex, rhodopsin, and ion-
channel proteins, have been suggested as potential sites
where general anesthetics could exert their functional
effects.*"'' we have selected an integral membrane
protein, the human erythrocyte ca?*-atpase, as a model
for studies of the mechanism of action of volatile an-
esthetics on plasma membrane proteins. this enzyme
is instrumental in ca?* homeostasis in the cell, because
it is the sole ca**-transporting system in the absence
of voltage-regulated ca?* channels, na/ca exchanger,
or er type ca**-atpase in human erythrocytes. thus,
any functional alteration of the ca?*-atpase by volatile
anesthetics may lead to serious perturbations in ca**-
regulated processes in the cell. impairment of ca?*
homeostasis in other cells, such as myocytes, has been

postulated as one of the possible mechanisms of an-
esthetic action.'7-'5

we developed conditions providing adequate quan-
tities of purified and functional, well characterized
ca’*-atpase, and established a straightforward assay of
the volatile anesthetics’ effect on the ca?*-atpase ac-
tivity.'°-25 indirect methods, such as inactivation stud-
ies, had to be applied, because high hydrophobicity of
membrane proteins makes measurements of the specific
volatile anesthetics binding by '°f-nmr spectroscopy
impractical.’ to determine whether the ca?*-atpase
is a suitable model for studies of the mechanism of
action of volatile anesthetics on plasma membrane
proteins, we investigated the effects of four volatile
anesthetics on enzyme activity, characterized the in-
hibition quantitatively, and compared the inhibitory
potency of the anesthetics to their clinical potency.
we established that the observed inhibition of the ca?*-
atpase meets the following criteria for a good model
protein: (1) it is dose-dependent, (2) it is reversible,
(3) it occurs at clinically relevant concentrations, and
(4) the correlation between clinical and inhibitory po-
tency is very good. we compared the inhibition of the
purified enzyme with that in the erythrocyte ghost
membrane to assure that the effect occurs directly on
this particular enzyme. we also used ghost membranes
to test the specificity of the anesthetic effect on the
ca**-atpase by showing that the ca?*-independent
mg’*-atpase present in the membrane is not inhibited
by the anesthetics at their clinical concentrations that
inhibit the ca?*-atpase.

the methods used for erythrocyte membrane ghosts
preparation, enzyme purification, determination of
protein concentrations, ca?* concentrations, and ca?*-
atpase activity assays were described previously.'77°
briefly, the enzyme was studied either in erythrocyte
ghost membranes or after purification from the mem-
branes by calmodulin affinity column chromatography
in the presence of the nonionic detergent c,.e,. total
calcium was measured by atomic absorption, and free
ca** concentrations were calculated from total calcium
and egta. ca?*-atpase activity was determined by
measurement of inorganic phosphate production. the
activity assay was performed in sealed polypropylene
1.7-ml tubes in a total reaction volume of 100 yl. after
the addition of all reagents, immediately after starting
the reaction with 3 mm atp, the volatile anesthetic was
delivered to the reaction tube in an air-tight hamilton
syringe, whereupon the tube was sealed and vortexed.
the reaction was carried out for 15-30 min at 37° c
or 25° c. samples were terminated with ammonium
molybdate/metavanadate at individual times, so the
anesthetic was not depleted. steady state velocities
were obtained from plots of inorganic phosphate pro-
duction, which are linear with time. the aliquots of
volatile anesthetics delivered to the assay tube were
taken from solutions of saturated volatile anesthetics
in reaction mixture, and were prepared daily from the
stock of pure volatile anesthetics under nitrogen gas.
except for  xxxd1844xxx  solutions, which were prepared
at 4° c, all anesthetic solutions were prepared at room
temperature. in parallel to the activity assay, tubes were
incubated under identical conditions and used for
measurements of the effective volatile anesthetic con-
centrations in the reaction mixture during the activity
assay. for concentration measurements, the anesthetic
was extracted from the reaction mixture with heptane,
and was measured by gas chromatography using a shi-
madzu 8a gas chromatograph (columbia, md) with
a glass column with torapack q 60/80 mesh packing
and a tcd detector.

the concentrations of volatile anesthetics in vol% in
gas were calculated from measured coefficients. the
following equations were used§: (1) vol% in gas (ml
of volatile anesthetics vapor/100 ml air) = [anesth-
ethic],,; x v’, where v’ = v x t'/t and v’ and v = the
molar gas volume at temperature t’ and at standard
condition (t = 273° k), respectively; (2) [anesth-
ethic],,, = [anesthethic]yy/a, where \ = the partition
coefficient (rm/gas), rm = the reaction mixture, and
[anesthetic] is defined in mm; and (3) [anesthethic],,,

the anesthetic in the reaction mixture as measured by
gas chromatography in heptane extract (ul anesthetic/
ml heptane), ey, = the anesthetic density, mwy, = its
molecular weight, and va = volatile anesthetic.

the partition coefficients were measured for each
volatile anesthetic at 37° c (and additionally at 25°
c for halothane), after 2 h incubation with 30 s vor-
texing at 15-min intervals. the partition coefficient
is defined as the ratio of the amount of volatile an-
esthetics present in the reaction mixture phase com-
pared with that in the gas phase, the two phases being
of equal volume and in equilibrium.?4 our measured
values for partition coefficients at 37° c are listed in
table 1, together with the literature values used for
volatile anesthetic density and the mac values (min-
imum alveolar concentration of an agent that pro-
duces immobility in 50 percent of those subjects ex-
posed to a noxious stimulus).?° the listed mac values
have been measured at 36-39° c, anid are expressed
here in vol% in vapor.

the reversibility of the inhibition of the ca?*-atpase
activity was demonstrated after partial removal of the
anesthetic from the reaction mixture by an nz purge.
proper controls were run in parallel, including purging
the reaction mixture that did not contain anesthetic,
and comparing the ca?*-atpase activities after purging
to the values obtained at standard assay conditions in
the sealed tube. the procedure resulted in 40-50%
reversibility of inactivation on an estimated 50% re-
moval of halothane.

standard deviations (sd) and standard errors of the
mean (sem) were used to compare different groups of
data. data are expressed as the mean + sem of inde-
pendent experiments.

as shown in figure 1, halothane causes significant re-

is observed at 0.57-0.85 vol% of halothane. in contrast,

thane is directly on this enzyme, and not through some
other membrane component. as shown in figure 2, the
inhibition patterns of the ca?*-atpase activity of the
purified enzyme, both in the presence and absence of
calmodulin, are comparable to those observed in the
ghost membrane, in that both activities are inhibited
quite dramatically and in a dose-dependent manner.
however, the biphasic effect noticeable in ghosts at
low anesthetic concentrations is not seen in the purified
enzyme, and the half-maximal inactivation in purified
enzyme occurs at lower halothane concentrations
(0.32—0.34 vol%).

nated volatile anesthetics, we included in the study
two other volatile anesthetics commonly used in clin-
ical practice (isoflurane and  xxxd1993xxx ) and one that is
currently undergoing clinical trials ( xxxd1844xxx ). as
shown in figure 3 for the calmodulin-dependent ca?*-
atpase activity, all studied anesthetics inhibit the en-
 xxxg1282xxx  in a dose-dependent manner that is similar to
halothane. the order of inhibitory potency is a de-
creasing one, from halothane, to isoflurane, to enflur-
ane, and then to  xxxd1844xxx .

the inhibitory potencies of the volatile anesthetics,
when plotted against their corresponding clinical po-
tencies (fig. 4), show that, the higher the mac value
of the volatile anesthetics, the higher the concentration
required to inhibit the ca**-atpase activity, both in
the presence.and absence of calmodulin. as shown by
bars in figure 4, although there are some differences in
isq values determined for different enzyme prepara-
tions, the order of volatile anesthetics potency and the
ratio between concentration dependence of the four
anesthetics are always the same. the half-maximal in-
hibition of the calmodulin-dependent and calmodulin-
independent activity, as established on several enzyme
preparations, occurs at 0.38-0.44 vol% isoflurane,
0.45-0.47 vol%  xxxd1993xxx , and 0.52-0.64 vol% des-
flurane.

the inhibition patterns of the ca?*-atpase activity
observed in the presence of halothane at 37° c (fig.
2) were compared with halothane’s effect at 25° c to
assess the nature of the interactions between volatile
anesthetics and enzyme. as shown in figure 5, the in-
hibition, as expressed in percentage of activity in the
absence of volatile anesthetics at the respective tem-
perature, is less at 25° c (iso = 0.46 vol%) than at 37°
c ([s9 = 0.34 vol%). the ratio of 1.3-1.4 between the
extent of inactivation at 25° c and 37° c is the same
for the ca**-atpase activity, in both the presence and
absence of calmodulin.

discussion

four volatile anesthetics have been selected for the
study of volatile anesthetic effect on the human eryth-
rocyte ca”*-atpase. three of these belong to a series
of halogenated methyl  xxxd2052xxx  derivatives, while
the fourth, halothane, is a two carbon alkane derivative

anesthesiology, v 79, no 4, oct 1993

(fig. 1). the four anesthetics comprise a homologous
series with respect to their clinical potency in humans
(table 1).

all four anesthetics decrease human erythrocyte ca?*-
atpase activity. in all cases, this inhibitory effect is
exerted in a range of concentrations routinely used in
clinical anesthesia at 37° c. the enzyme’s sensitivity
to the anesthetics appears to be great: the ca?*-atpase
activity is half inhibited at anesthetic concentrations
equal to ~0.3—0.4 mac for  xxxd1993xxx , halothane, and
isoflurane, and =0.13 mac for  xxxd1844xxx . the reason
for the distinctly lower value of the ratio i,,/mac ob-
tained for  xxxd1844xxx  is not clear at this time.

the order of inhibitory potency of the four anesthetics
shows that, with respect to the concentration required
to half-maximally inhibit the ca?*-atpase activity,
halothane is the most potent. this order is consistent
with the reported order of inhibitory potency of halo-
thane, isoflurane, and  xxxd1993xxx  on ca?* transport in
other systems. for example, ca?* uptake by the sr ca?*-
atpase is inhibited the most by halothane and the least
by  xxxd1993xxx .”¢ in skinned fibers, ca”* release from the
sarcoplasmic reticulum has also been shown to be de-

pressed by the volatile anesthetics, with halothane,
again, more potent than isoflurane.?’ electrophysio-
logic studies indicate that the volatile anesthetics de-
press slow channel mediated ca”* flux into the myo-
cyte, with halothane being more potent than isoflu-
rane.”* no comparative biochemical studies have been
published on  xxxd1844xxx .

the purified, detergent-solubilized ca?+-atpase
preparation has been repeatedly demonstrated to be
very well suited for studies of the ca?*-atpase in plasma
membrane (for review, see kosk-kosicka”). the cur-
rent report also shows its appropriateness for studies
of the volatile anesthetics’ effect on the enzyme in
erythrocyte membranes. it also seems highly probable
that our findings on this purified enzyme could rep-
resent volatile anesthetics’ effect on ca?*-atpases op-
erating in the plasma membrane of other cells. for ex-
ample, we observed that halothane inhibits the ca2*-
atpase activity in crude preparations of dog brain syn-
aptosomal membranes in a manner similar to that dem-
onstrated for the enzyme in human erythrocyte ghosts
(unpublished results).

the observed temperature dependence of the inhi-
bition by halothane provides some insight into the na-
ture of the interaction that leads to the enzyme inhi-
bition. the fact that the inhibition of the ca2*-atpase
by halothane is less at 25° c than at 37° c is consistent
with direct interactions of the nonpolar portions of
halothane with nonpolar surfaces of the enzyme, be-
cause the hydrophobic interactions are weaker at de-
creased temperature.??*° weaker interactions at 25° c
apparently cause weaker inhibition of the ca?*-atpase
in both activation pathways, i.e., in the presence and
absence of calmodulin. a specific binding of the volatile
anesthetics to the hydrophobic regions on the enzyme
protein, rather than a membrane bilayer lipid mediated
effect, is also in agreement with the lack of change in
erythrocyte membrane lipid fluidity measured as the
order parameter with 5-, 12-, and 1 6-doxyl  xxxd3244xxx 
in the erythrocyte on exposure to 1 vol% halothane. ||
however, the involvement of a few specific phospho-
lipid molecules cannot be excluded.

in conclusion, our data demonstrate that volatile an-
esthetics inactivate the ca?*-atpase, an enzyme crucial
for maintaining ca?* homeostasis in the cell. it remains
to be shown whether this phenomenon is closely re-

lated to the clinical effects of anesthesia. the good cor-
relation between anesthetics’ clinical potency and the
extent of enzyme inhibition demands attention, es-
pecially when the target protein(s) for volatile anes-
thetics’ action has not yet been established.

our data show that the ca?*-atpase is a good model
protein to study anesthetic effects. furthermore, this
enzyme is easily assayed, easily purified in sufficient
quantities, and has a known primary structure. these
properties, along with the presented characteristics of
enzyme inhibition by volatile anesthetics, make the
ca**-atpase an excellent model in which to perform
biochemical studies of anesthetic effects on membrane
proteins.
