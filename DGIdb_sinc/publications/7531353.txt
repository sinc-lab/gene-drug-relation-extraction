abstract. this review reports on the pharmacodynamics
of the new antipsychotic risperidone. the primary action
of risperidone is serotonin  xxxg1113xxx  blockade as
shown by displacement of radioligand binding (ki:
0.16 nm), activity on isolated tissues (ecso: 0.5 nm), and
antagonism of peripherally (eds0:0.0011 mg/kg) and
centrally (eds0:0.014 mg/kg) acting 5-ht 2 receptor agonists in rats. risperidone is at least as potent as the
specific  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist ritanserin in these
tests. risperidone is also a potent dopamine d 2 receptor
antagonist as indicated by displacement of radioligand
binding (ki: 1.4 nm), activity in isolated striatal slices
(icso: 0.89 nm), and antagonism of peripherally (edso:
0.0057 mg/kg in dogs) and centrally acting d 2 receptor
agonists (eds0:0.056-0.15 mg/kg in rats). risperidone
shows all effects common to d 2 antagonists, including
enhancement of prolactin release. however, some central
effects such as catalepsy and blockade of motor activity
occur at high doses only. risperidone is 4-10 times less
potent than haloperidol as a central d 2 antagonist in rats
and it differs from haloperidol by the following characteristics: predominant 5-ht2 antagonism; lsd antagonism; effects on sleep; smooth dose-response curves for
0 2 antagonism; synergism of combined 5-ht2/d 2 antagonism; pronounced effects on amphetamine-induced
oxygen consumption; increased social interaction; and
pronounced effects on dopamine (da) turnover. risperidone displays similar activity at pre- and postsynaptic d 2
receptors and at d2 receptors from various rat brain regions. the binding affinity for d 4 and d 3 receptors is 5
and 9 times weaker, respectively, than for d 2 receptors;
interaction with d 1 receptors occurs only at very high
concentrations. the pharmacological profile of risperidone includes interaction with histamine h1 and ~adrenergic receptors but the compound is devoid of significant interaction with cholinergic and a variety of othunpublished research reports are available from documentation

er types of receptors. risperidone has excellent oral activity, a rapid onset, and a 24-h duration of action. its major
metabolite,  xxxd2830xxx , closely mimics risperidone in pharmacodynamics. risperidone can be characterized as a potent d 2 antagonist with predominant
5ht 2 antagonistic activity and optimal pharmacokinetic
properties.

risperidone is a novel benzisoxazole antipsychotic
(fig. 1), which has been reported in placebo-controlled,
double-blind studies (borison et al. 1991; chouinard et
al. 1993) to improve both the positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusional thinking, severe excitement and unusual behavior) and the negative symptoms (anergy, apathy, lack of drive, social withdrawal and depressive
mood) of schizophrenia with a low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects (eps). risperidone (4 mg/day)
might have similar efficacy and low eps liability to clozapine (400 rag/day) but seems to be better tolerated (heinrich et al. 1991). its beneficial effects are maintained during long-term treatment at an average optimal dose of
6 mg/day (mertens t991; chouinard et al. 1993).
the present review deals with the pharmacodynamics
of risperidone. risperidone has been selected in preclinical studies because it combines potent dopamine d 2 antagonism with predominant serotonin 5-ht 2 antagonistic activity. according to current evidence, the combination of both activities might provide a new strategy in the
management of chronic psychoses (janssen 1987; meltzer
et al. 1989). this evidence has been reviewed (meltzer and
stahl 1976; niemegeers et al. 1990; meltzer and nash
1991).

tor agonist tryptamine in rats (tedeschi et al. 1961). together with the close resemblance between the chemical
structures of 5-ht and the hallucinogen lsd, this was a
major reason for woolley (1962) to hypothesize that
schizophrenia might be related to excessive 5-ht in the
brain. the early 5-ht antagonists  xxxd2621xxx  and cinanserin, however, frequently aggravated the positive
symptoms of schizophrenia (for references: niemegeers et
al. 1990). some other property of the neuroleptics had to
be responsible for the reduction of positive symptoms,
especially since haloperidol, though lacking the relatively
potent 5-ht antagonism of the phenothiazines, was very
effective against these florid symptoms. haloperidol
played a critical role in studies on the central dopaminergic system, from those defining the role of central dopamine (da) antagonism in accelerated da turnover
(carlsson and lindqvist 1963) to the discovery of the
dopamine d 2 receptors (burr et ai. 1975; seeman et al.
1975). the da hypothesis of schizophrenia linked the
disease to amphetamine, which has long been known to
induce psychotic symptoms in man (connell 1958; mc
lellan et al. 1979) and to aggravate existing symptoms in
schizophrenic patients (janowsky and davis 1974). amphetamine releases da and induces a particular abnormal behavior in animals that can be inhibited by central
da antagonists. important events that re-established interest in central 5-ht include the finding that tryptamine
antagonism in rats is indeed related to binding to 5-ht
receptors (leysen et al. 1978); that early 5-ht antagonists partly mimic the subjective effects of lsd in drug
discrimination studies (colpaert et al. 1982); and that
specific 5-ht a antagonists such as ritanserin (leysen et
al. 1985; awouters et al. 1988) can complement neuroleptic therapy by improving the effects on negative symptoms and reducing eps (reyntjens et al. 1986). it is in this
context that risperidone was studied and evaluated.

1988, 1992, 1993a,b). table 1 lists the equilibrium dissociation constant (k0 and dissociation time (tl/2) for the
relevant interactions. risperidone shows very high affinity for rat frontal cortex 5-ht 2 receptors (ki: 0.16 nm)
and is twice as potent as ritanserin in this respect.  xxxd1891xxx 
times higher nanomolar concentrations, risperidone
binds to d 2 receptors (ki: 1.4 nm); it is only three times
less potent than haloperidol in this regard. nanomolar
affinity is also found for ~l-adrenoceptors and histamine
h1 receptors. still higher concentrations bind to d4-, ~2-,
and d 3 receptors. no interactions with other types of
receptors are observed at concentrations up to 200 times
the k i for the 5-ht 2 receptor. no species differences in
binding affinity for 5-ht 2 and d2 receptors have been
observed between man and rats: the binding affinity for
cloned human 5-ht 2 receptors (ki: 0.44 rim) and d 2 receptors (k~: 3.1 and 4.7 nm for the d2l and d2s type,
respectively) is very comparable to that for the corresponding rat brain receptors. the interaction of risperidone with various subtypes of da receptors is discussed
later in this article, comparative data on the receptor
binding profile of a large series of neuroleptics are available (leysen and niemegeers 1985; leysen et al. 1993b).

interactions of risperidone with receptors in the central
nervous system

the interactions of risperidone with its target receptors
within the cns are discussed below.

interaction with central serotonin 5 - h t2 receptors

as already shown in 1961 for a series of phenothiazines
(tedeschi et al, 1961), most neuroleptics antagonize the
forepaw convulsions evoked in rats by the 5-ht agonist
tryptamine (niemegeers and janssen 1979; leysen and
niemegeers 1985). this tryptamine antagonistic effect in
rats correlates highly significantly with binding to 5-ht 2
receptors (leysen et al. 1978). risperidone is very potent
in this respect: it inhibits the intensity of tryptamine
(40 mg/kg, iv)-induced seizures at very low doses (edso:
0.014 mg/kg, 1 h after sc administration) and higher
doses completely block the convulsions (sc eds0:
0.056 mg/kg; janssen et al. 1988). at similar low doses
[0.0082-0.043 mg/kg at time of peak effect (0.5-1 h after
administration); fig. 2], risperidone inhibits other effects
induced by serotonergic agents in rats, such as coarse
body tremors induced by tryptamine (40 mg/kg, iv) and
head twitches induced by mescaline (20 mg/kg, iv), 5-hydroxytryptophan
(5-htp; 320 mg/kg,
ip), 2,5dimethoxy-4- xxxd2589xxx  (dom; 1.25 mg/kg,
iv), or quipazine (3.2 mg/kg, sc) (janssen et al. 1988;
niemegeers et al. 1990; perregaard et al. 1992). highly

significant correlations between the potencies to block
the serotonin agonist-induced behavioral effects (bilateral convulsions of the forepaws, coarse body tremors, and
head-twitches) and the binding affinities for the 5-ht2
receptor suggest that these responses are mediated via
5-ht 2 receptors (leysen et al., 1984; leysen and
niemegeers 1985). risperidone is at least as potent as
ritanserin as a central 5-ht 2 antagonist in rats (janssen
et al. 1988).
the interaction of risperidone with central 5-ht 2 receptors is confirmed by receptor binding techniques such
as ex vivo autoradiography of brain slices and in vivo
inhibition of [3h]spiperone labelling (schotte et al. 1989,
1993; leysen et al. 1992, 1993b). two hours after sc
administration of risperidone to rats, the 5-ht 2 receptors
in the frontal cortex are occupied by 50% at doses
(0.0374).12 mg/kg) that are only slightly higher than the
peak effect doses required for the above mentioned behavioral effects (0.5-1 h after sc administration; fig. 2).
partial inhibition of [3h]spiperone labelling in other
brain regions (nucleus accumbens, striatum and tuberculum olfactorium) at doses below 0.04 mg/kg probably also reflects occupancy of 5-ht 2 receptors (leysen et al.
1992).
feedback activation of 5-ht turnover upon 5-ht 2
receptor blockade (as observed for the dopaminergic system) is found neither with risperidone (> 10 mg/kg, sc;
leysen et al. 1992) nor with ritanserin (> 40 mg/kg, sc;
leysen et al. 1985).
interaction with central dopamine d 2 receptors

administration of the directly acting da receptor agonist apomorphine to rats induces motor stimulation (increased locomotion and rearing) and stereotyped behavior (compulsive sniffing, licking, and chewing). low doses
of da antagonists inhibit these behavioral effects (i.e.,
they reduce the intensity of the behavior to below the
control level) with potencies that correlate significantly
with their binding affinity for d 2 receptors (leysen and
niemegeers 1985). risperidone inhibits apomorphine
(1.25 mg/kg, iv)-induced motor stimulation and stereotyped behavior (and thus displays central d 2 antagonism) at low doses (sc eds0:0.15 mg/kg at 0.5 h after
administration); higher doses completely block the apomorphine-induced effects (1.2 mg/kg; janssen et al. 1988).
in rats, risperidone is thus 10 times less potent as a central d 2 antagonist (eds0:0.15 mg/kg for apomorphine
antagonism) than as a central 5-ht 2 antagonist (edso
0.014 mg/kg for tryptamine antagonism). the central d 2
antagonism of risperidone is confirmed by its action
against the behavioral effects (increased locomotion and
rearing) of indirectly acting da agonists such as amphetamine (2.5 mg/kg, sc) and cocaine (5 mg/kg, iv) and
is found at doses ranging between 0.041 and 0.20 mg/kg
at time of peak effect (0.5-1 h after sc administration in
the rat; fig. 2; janssen et al. 1988). risperidone is 4-10
times less potent than haloperidol in these standard tests
for central d 2 antagonism in which many neuroleptics
have been evaluated (janssen et al. 1965a, 1967;

12
niemegeers and janssen 1979). risperidone has further
been reported to inhibit the discriminative stimulus effects of amphetamine in rats and to antagonize apomorphine-induced climbing and methylphenidate-induced
gnawing in mice (hrib et al. 1991; meert 1991; perregaard et al. 1992).
risperidone shows all behavioral effects common to
central d2 antagonists but some of them occur only at
relatively high doses, e.g., catalepsy (eds0:3.0 versus
0.13 mg/kg, sc for haloperidol; janssen et al. 1988; megens et al. 1992 a) and complete blockade of motor activity in rats (2.8 versus 0.085 mg/kg, sc for haloperidol;
megens et al. 1988a). in rats, risperidone also depresses
rearing (0.062 versus 0.038 mg/kg, sc for haloperidol;
megens et al. 1988a), locomotion (0.18 versus 0.060 rag/
kg, sc for haloperidol; megens et al. 1988a), intracranial
self-stimulation (0.080 versus 0.021 mg/kg, sc for haloperidol; janssen et al. 1988), conditioned avoidance responding (0.48 versus 0.53 mg/kg, ip for haloperidol,
hrib et al. 1991) and conditioned food consumption (0.89
versus 0.064mg/kg, sc for haloperidol; janssen et al.
1988). in selected mouse-killing rats, risperidone depresses the voracity (1.3 versus 0.12 mg/kg, sc for haloperidol), i.e., the tendency to devour the victim, but not the
innate aggressiveness (>2.5mg/kg, sc; megens et al.
1988b), i.e., the tendency to kill the intruder mouse within
a given period of time; other neuroleptics also depress
voracity without affecting aggressiveness (janssen et al.
1962). conditioned avoidance responding is also inhibited in dogs (0.16 versus 0.056 mg/kg, sc for haloperidol;
janssen et al. 1988) and squirrel monkeys (0.034 versus
0.0086 mg/kg, im for haloperidol; bergman et al. 1991).
risperidone occupies central d2 receptors after sc
administration as indicated by ex vivo autoradiography
of brain slices and in vivo inhibition of [3h]spiperone
labelling (schotte et al. 1989, 1993; leysen et al. 1992,
1993b). two hours after administration, the d 2 receptors
in various rat brain regions are occupied by 50% at doses
ranging between 0.22 and 1.3 mg/kg, which is somewhat
higher than the peak effect doses required for antagonism
of da agonist-induced behavioral effects (0.041~0.20 rag/
kg at 0.5-1 h after sc administration; fig. 2).
like other neuroleptics, risperidone (0.01 10 mg/kg,
sc) readily increases da turnover as shown in the striaturn, nucleus accumbens, tuberculum olfactorium, and,
to some extent, the frontal cortex (bogdanov et al. 1991;
leysen et al. 1992). the effects of risperidone on da
turnover are compared with those of haloperidol later in
this paper.
antagonism of apomorphine-induced emesis in dogs
is generally used to predict the oral dose and the onset
and duration of antipsychotic action in man, at least for
d2 antagonists that readily penetrate the brain (janssen
et al. 1965b; niemegeers and janssen 1979). risperidone
shows high oral activity, a rapid onset, and a 24-h duration of action in this test (janssen et al. 1988) which takes
into account the generation of an active metabolite and
which is performed in a species that closely resembles
man in pharmacokinetic properties.

interaction with central histamine h 1 receptors

ex vivo autoradiography of brain slices indicates that
risperidone occupies central h~-receptors in the cerebellum of guinea-pigs (sc edso: 0.32-0.58 mg/kg; fig. 2;
schotte et al. 1993). this interaction with central histamine h~ receptors has not been evaluated in functional
tests. histamine h~ antagonism is found with many other
neuroleptics (niemegeers and janssen 1979; leysen and
niemegeers 1985). as frequently observed with antihistamines used for the treatment of allergic diseases, it may
result in somnolence and contribute to the sedation observed in patients at higher doses of risperidone
(> 15 mg/day; borison et al. 1992).

interaction with central al-adrenoceptors

risperidone occupies a~-adrenoceptors in the frontal
cortex and the thalamus (50% occupancy at 0.45-2.2 mg/
kg, sc; fig. 2; schotte et al. 1989, 1993; leysen et al.
1993b). the interaction with central %-adrenoceptors
has not been evaluated in functional tests. it is frequently
observed with neuroleptics but not thought to play a role
in antipsychotic action (niemegeers and janssen 1979;
leysen and niemegeers 1985). in this context, it may be
worthwhile mentioning that the specific a~-adrenoceptor
antagonist  xxxd3000xxx  does not affect the symptoms of
schizophrenia (hommer et al. 1984). it should be noted,
however, that risperidone has 120 times higher affinity
for the ~b- than for the ~la-subtype of the ~-adrenoceptor (ki: 2.3 and 283 nm, respectively); other antipsychotics failed to show selectivity for either subtype
(sleight et al. 1993).

interaction with central ~2-adrenoceptors

risperidone occupies central ~2-adrenoceptors in the entorhinal cortex/amygdaloid complex (sc eds0: 2.05.4mg/kg; fig. 2; leysen et al. 1993b; schotte et al.
1993). as a functional correlate, risperidone reverses xylazine-induced loss of righting reflex (sc eds0:2.4 mg/
kg; fig. 2; janssen et al. 1988). in isolated occipital cortex
slices of rats, risperidone reverses the clonidine-induced
inhibition of k+-stimulated norepinephrine release
(ics0:15 nm; leysen et al. 1988). as the interaction with
central ~2-adrenoceptors occurs at relatively high doses
of risperidone (fig. 2), it is not expected to play a role in
its clinical effects.

interaction with central dopamine d 3 and d e receptors

risperidone has relatively high affinity for the d 3 and d 4
receptors, which both belong to the d z family of the da
receptor subtypes (civelli et al. 1991 ; grandy et al. 1991 ;
sokoloff et al. 1992). functional correlates of binding to
d 3 and d 4 receptors are not yet available.

a comparison of risperidone with haloperidol

gradual dose-response curve for d 2 antagonism

predominant 5-ht2 antagonism

the therapeutic effects of neuroleptics are thought to be
related to appropriate inhibition and their eps to excessive blockade of the central dopaminergic neurotransmission. various data listed below suggest that the dosedependent blockade of central d 2 receptors proceeds
more gradually with risperidone than with haloperidol,
which may allow finer tuning of central dopaminergic
activity. apart from possibly reducing eps liability, this
may also enhance the therapeutic margin for effects on
negative symptoms.

like haloperidol, risperidone is a potent antagonist at
central d 2 receptors. in contrast to haloperidol, however,
risperidone also blocks central 5-ht 2 receptors at doses
that are about 10 times lower than those required for the
blockade of central d 2 receptors (fig. 2). similar predominant 5-ht 2 antagonism has been observed with clozapine and pipamperone (niemegeers and janssen 1979),
two compounds that are clinically characterized by antiautistic, disinhibiting and resocializing effects, low eps
liability, and regulatory effects on disturbed sleep
rhythms (simpson and varga 1974; gerlach et al. 1975;
deberdt 1976; ansoms et al. 1977; povlsen et al. 1985;
malsch 1987). as risperidone is several times more potent
than pipamperone and clozapine in animal behavioral
tests (eds0 for apomorphine antagonism in rats: 0.15, 3.0
and 6.0mg/kg, sc, respectively; niemegeers 1989), it
might be suggested that risperidone may show similar
therapeutic properties at much lower doses.

lsd and dom antagonism

the hallucinogenic 5-ht agonists lsd and dom induce psychotic symptoms in man (woolley 1962; jaffe
1985). rats can be trained in operant conditioning tasks
to discriminate these hallucinogens from saline. in such
trained rats, several 5-ht antagonists (e.g., metergoline,
 xxxd1785xxx , metitepine, cinanserin, and  xxxd2637xxx )
antagonize the stimulus effects of lsd only partially;
moreover, they are recognized as having lsd-like stimulus properties (colpaert et al. 1982). such partial agonist
effects might have prevented the adequate expression of
central 5-ht 2 antagonism in patients (persyko 1972; see
introduction). like ritanserin, however, risperidone
(0.024 0.028 mg/kg, sc) effectively and fully antagonizes
the stimulus effects of both lsd and dom, and it is not
recognized as an lsd- or dom-like stimulus and is thus
devoid of any agonist activity (meert et al. 1989, 1990;
meert 1991). as haloperidol is not active against the
stimulus effects of lsd and dom, these results suggest
that risperidone may be effective against some psychotic
symptoms in man that are refractory to haloperidol.

effects on sleep

in contrast to haloperidol and like ritanserin, low doses
of risperidone (0.01-0.16 mg/kg, ip or sc) increase deep
slow wave sleep at the expense of wakefulness, light slow
wave sleep and paradoxical sleep (dugovic et al. 1989,
1992). this effect may contribute to the therapeutic effect
of risperidone, since deep slow wave sleep is often impaired in schizophrenic patients (hiatt et al. 1985). similar effects on disturbed sleep patterns in patients have
been previously reported for pipamperone (ansoms et al.
1977).

d 2 receptor occupancy. risperidone occupies central d 2
receptors in terminal regions more gradually than
haloperidol (the slopes of the log dose-response curves
are about 50% smaller; leysen et al. 1993b; schotte et al.
1993; see fig. 3a for striatal d 2 receptors): 25% occupancy in the nucleus accumbens (which may be sufficient
for antipsychotic activity) is obtained with haloperidol at
0.052 mg/kg and with risperidone at 0.059 mg/kg; 75%
occupancy of striatal d 2 receptors (which may produce
eps) is obtained with haloperidol at 0.38 mg/kg (dose
ratio: 7.3) but with risperidone at a dose as high as
4.1 mg/kg (dose ratio: 70).
motor activity. d 2 antagonists dose-dependently depress
motor activity, presumably corresponding to the increasing level of central d 2 receptor blockade: first they depress rearing, then locomotion, and finally all components of motor activity, including small postural movements. risperidone depresses motor activity more gradually than haloperidol: it is only slightly less potent for
inhibition of rearing and locomotion (fig. 3b and c) but
as much as 33 times less potent for complete blockade of
motor activity (megens et al. 1988a; fig. 3d). moreover,
the inhibition of rearing and locomotion proceeds more
gradually with risperidone than with haloperidol (the
slopes of the log dose-response curves are about 50%
smaller). the ability of risperidone to preserve small motor movements up to high doses may be related to a
lower eps liability.
catalepsy. at high doses, central d 2 antagonists induce
catalepsy, a typical wax-like rigidity, thought to be mediated via excessive blockade of central d2 receptors and
considered to be predictive for eps in man. compared
with haloperidol, risperidone induces maximal catalepsy
at a relatively high dose (sc eds0:3.0 versus 0.13 mg/kg
for haloperidol; janssen et al. 1988) comparable with that
required for complete blockade of motor activity (see
above). the dissociation between inhibition of ampetamine-induced behavioral effects (sc eds0:0.056 and
0.016 mg/kg for risperidone and haloperidol, respectively; janssen et al. 1988) and induction of catalepsy is wider
with risperidone (dose ratio: 54) than with haloperidol
(dose ratio: 8.1), in agreement with more gradual d 2 antagonism.

phetamine in rats have been studied in detail in motor
activity cages (megens et al. 1989, 1992b,c). amphetamine dose-dependently stimulates motor activity,
which can be measured as increased locomotion and
rearing. at a low dose of amphetamine (0.63 mg/kg),
risperidone is about equipotent with haloperidol in reducing the amphetamine-induced increase of rearing and
locomotion (figs 3e-f) but it is considerably less potent
in completely blocking all motor movements (fig. 3g),
which again suggests gradually increasing dz antagonism. with increasing dose of amphetamine (up to 5 mg/
kg), risperidone becomes up to 12 times less potent than
haloperidol against the increased locomotion and rearing. relatively high doses of risperidone are apparently
required to obtain the high level of  xxxg656xxx  blockade
necessary for reversing the very pronounced motor stim-

still higher doses of amphetamine (> 5 mg/kg) induce
stereotyped behavior, i.e., compulsive sniffing, licking
and chewing behavior that is further characterized by the
relative absence of exploratory behavior such as locomotion and rearing. risperidone reverses the amphetamine
(10 mg/kg)-induced suppression of locomotion at similar
doses to haloperidol but maintains this "activating" or
"disinhibitory" effect over a much wider dose range
(fig. 3h).

apomorphine antagonism. the dose-response curves for
antagonism of the behavioral responses induced in rats by
apomorphine or by a combined apomorphine-tryptamine challenge proceed more gradually with risperidone than with haloperidol (fig. 4; awouters et al. 1990).

synergism of combined 5-ht2/d 2 receptor blockade
mutual interactions between serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission have been demonstrated in rats
by awouters et al. (1990). pretreatment with the da agonist apomorphine potentiates the forepaw convulsions
induced by the 5-ht agonist tryptamine, as indicated by
the 2.5 times higher doses of the 5-ht 2 antagonists risperidone and ritanserin required for 50% inhibition of
these convulsions compared with those induced by
tryptamine alone. conversely, tryptamine also potentiates the motor stimulation induced by apomorphine, as
reflected in an increase of the total score by 59%. ritanserin reduces the motor stimulation only by the part
corresponding to the tryptamine enhancement (maximum 35% reduction; data not shown). haloperidol is
equally effective against the enhanced as against the unenhanced apomorphine response (fig. 4). risperidone's
activity against the enhanced motor stimulation starts at
very low doses and 50% inhibition is already obtained at
a dose that is 9 times lower than that required against the
single apomorphine challenge (fig. 4). the activity gain
obtained with risperidone suggests that the combined 5htsd2-antagonism of risperidone may lead to a synergistic control of interacting serotonergic and dopaminergic stimuli.
other observations also suggest synergistic effects resulting from the combined 5-ht2/d2 antagonism of
risperidone. as already mentioned, risperidone antagonizes lsd stimulus effects and completely blocks 5-htp
head twitches in rats at doses (sc eds0:0.028 and
0.097 mg/kg, respectively; meert et al. 1988; meert 1991)
that occupy both central 5-ht 2 and d 2 receptors (sc
edso: 0.067 and 0.66 mg/kg, respectively; schotte et al.
1993). haloperidol, which occupies central d 2 receptors
at low doses (0.13 mg/kg) and central 5-ht 2 receptors at
high doses (1.3 mg/kg), is devoid of lsd antagonism
(> 0.63 mg/kg) and blocks 5-htp head twitches at a relatively high dose only (1.3 mg/kg). ritanserin, which occupies central 5-ht2 receptors at low doses (0.02 mg/kg;

and haloperidol (squares) against the motor stimulation induced by apomorphine (1.25mg/kg, iv) in rats
pretreated with saline (closed symbols) or tryptamine
(40 mg/kg, iv; open symbols)

schotte et al. 1989) but fails to occupy central d 2 receptors (> 40 mg/kg), is not a very potent lsd antagonist
(1'1 mg/kg) and inhibits but does not block 5-htp head
twitches (> 10 mg/kg). when ritanserin is combined with
a low dose of haloperidol (0.04-0.08 mg/kg), however, its
activity increases: the lsd stimulus effects are antagonized at 0.22 mg/kg and the 5-htp head twitches are
blocked at 0.19 mg/kg (table 2). similar results are obtained in the "paw test": the dissociation between foreand hind-paw retraction from a holeboard is wider with
risperidone (> 20 versus 0.59 mg/kg) than with haloperidol (0.77 versus 0.26 mg/kg; meert and awouters 1991).
however, the dissociation obtained with haloperidol is
increased by co-administration of ritanserin (ellenbroek
1988). the synergistic effects associated with combined
5-ht2/d 2 antagonism may result in a more efficient control of interacting serotonergic and dopaminergic stimuli
than obtained with conventional neuroleptics.
effects on amphetamine-induced oxygen
hyperconsumption
amphetamine (2.5 mg/kg, sc) stimulates motor activity
and increases oxygen consumption in rats (niemegeers
and janssen 1975). tricyclic antidepressants inhibit the
oxygen hyperconsumption at lower doses than the motor
stimulation, presumably by actions related to amine uptake inhibition. in contrast, haloperidol and other neuroleptics reduce the motor stimulation and oxygen hyperconsumption in parallel, presumably as a consequence of central d 2 receptor blockade. even though devoid of effects on amine uptake, risperidone inhibits oxygen hyperconsumption at lower doses than the motor
stimulation (edso: 0.016 and 0.056 mg/kg, respectively;
janssen et al. 1988) and resembles tricyclic antidepressants rather than conventional neuroleptics in this respect [see janssen and awouters (1993) for a more detailed discussion and a comparison of risperidone with
other neuroleptics and antidepressants]. risperidone is at

effects on social interaction

in contrast to haloperidol and like clozapine, risperidone
(0.062 mg/kg, ip) increases social interaction time between pairs of unfamiliar rats (corbett et al. 1993).

known (carlsson and lindqvist 1963; bunney et al. 1973;
sedvall 1975) and has been related to the behavioral disinhibitory effects observed after low doses of central d 2
antagonists in various clinical situations, such as anxiety
and depression (rogerson and butler 1971; deberdt
1974; heinrich and lehman 1989). the enhanced release
of da triggered by the low level of d 2 receptor blockade
seems to result in an enhanced level of d 2 receptor stimulation, at least at low doses at which the majority of the
receptors are unoccupied. central 5-ht 2 antagonism
seems to potentiate this feedback activation of the dopaminergic system: it potentiates the effects of neuroleptics on da turnover (saller et al. 1990; devaud and
hollingsworth 1991), blocks the normally occurring 5ht-dependent, tonic inhibition of a10 dopaminergic
neurons (ugedo et al. 1989), slightly activates midbrain
dopaminergic activity and enhances da release in terminal regions (svensson et al. 1993). the activating effect of
5-ht2 antagonism appears to preferentially involve prefrontal dopaminergic neurons and, combined with a low
level of d 2 receptor blockade, to enhance phasic rather
than tonic activity (svensson et al. 1993). it is thought to
improve the "signal to noise ratio" of dopaminergic information transfer that is believed to be disturbed in
schizophrenic patients (svensson et al. 1993). by activating the dopaminergic system, central 5-ht 2 antagonism
may be expected both to potentiate the behavioral disinhibitory effects that are normally observed at low doses
of d 2 antagonists, and to reduce the eps that are normally observed at high doses of d 2 antagonists. central
5-ht antagonists have indeed been found to reduce neuroleptic-induced catalepsy in rats (costall et al. 1975;
maj et al. 1975; balsara et al. 1979; hicks 1990), dyskinesias in monkeys (korsgaard et al. 1985), and eps in man
(reyntjens et al. 1986).

effects on dopamine turnover

like haloperidol, risperidone increases da turnover
(leysen et al. 1992). whereas haloperidol produces bellshaped curves (maximum at 0.16-0.63 mg/kg), risperidone tends to continuously increase turnover up to
10 mg/kg; moreover, maximum metabolite levels tended
to be (1.5 times) higher with risperidone than with
haloperidol, but the difference was not statistically significant due to large variability.

a pharmacokinetic explanation

the levels of risperidone and its active metabolite in rat
striatum increase less than dose proportionally after subcutaneous administration of risperidone (van beijsterveldt et al. 1993), which may contribute to a gradual
increase in  xxxg656xxx  blockade and a corresponding
low eps liability.

mechanism of action of risperidone

differential interaction with dopamine receptor subtypes

a potential mechanism of action of risperidone based on
interaction between central serotonergic and dopaminergic systems is discussed below. alternative mechanisms
of action are discussed in subsequent sections.

interaction with d 2 receptors in different brain regions.
preferential blockade of mesolimbic dz receptors is often
suggested to favour antipsychotic action over the motor
disturbances that are believed to result from d 2 receptor
blockade in the basal ganglia (stevens 1973; wilk et al.
1975; crow et al. 1977). risperidone does not differentiate between d2 receptors from various rat brain regions
(striatum, nucleus accumbens, tuberculum olfactorium,
and substantia nigra), as indicated by receptor binding
studies in vitro (ki: 1.4~.0 nm; leysen et al. 1992), in
vivo (sc eds0:0.5-1.2 mg/kg; leysen et al. 1992; schotte

modulation of dopamine d 2 by serotonin 5-ht2
antagonism

the feedback activation of the dopaminergic system in
response to postsynaptic  xxxg656xxx  blockade is well-

17
et al. 1993), and ex vivo (sc edso: 0.58 0.85 mg/kg; leysen et al. 1993b; schotte et al. 1993).
interaction with presynaptic and postsynaptic d2 receptors. differential interaction with pre- and postsynaptic
da receptors has been proposed as a principle to achieve
antipsychotic action without eps (/~lander et al. 1980;
magnusson et al. 1988). risperidone inhibits at similar
concentrations (0.89-5.0 rim) the effects of amphetamine
and the d 2 specific agonist ly-151,555 on the reiease of
da (mediated via presynaptic d 2 receptors) and acetylcholine (mediated via postsynaptic d 2 receptors) in rat
striatal slices and is equipotent with haloperidol in this
respect (leysen et al. 1988). likewise, risperidone occupies d 2 receptors in cell body and terminal regions at
similar doses; however, those in terminal regions (caudate/putamen, accumbens, tuberculum olfactorium) are
more gradually occupied with increase of dose than those
in a cell body region (substantia nigra) (leysen et al.
1993b; schotte et al. 1993). finally, risperidone antagonizes the presynaptic  xxxg656xxx -mediated, apomorphine-induced inhibition of  xxxd2471xxx  synthesis in rat striatum with a similar potency difference
relative to haloperidol as generally found in vivo for
postsynaptic d 2 receptor-mediated effects (edso: 0.32
versus 0.07 mg/kg, iv for haloperidol; blum and davis
1988).
interaction with d 1, d2, d3, d4, and ds receptors. recently,
five different genes for subtypes of da receptors have
been identified: two encoding for the d~-receptor family
(d1a and d1b or ds), and three encoding for proteins of
the dz-receptor family (d2, d3 and d4) (civelli et al.
1991; grandy et al. 1991; sokoloff et al. 1992). the involvement of the new receptor subtypes in the therapeutic and side effects of antipsychotics has not yet been
determined. the affinity of risperidone for d 4 and d 3
receptors is 5 and 9 times lower, respectively, than that
for d 2 receptors; interactions with d1 receptors occur
only at high concentrations. studies on interactions with
d 5 receptors are not yet available.

interaction with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors

based on the well documented balance between central
dopaminergic and cholinergic systems (corrodi et al.
1972), central da antagonists with a so-called "built-in"
antimuscarinic activity have been proposed as antipsychotics with low eps liability (snyder et al. 1974). unfortunately, antimuscarinic activity also weakens antipsychotic activity and causes serious side effects (richelson
1984; meltzer and nash 1991). in contrast to, e.g., clozapine, risperidone is completely devoid of anticholinergic
activity (janssen et al. 1988; leysen et al. 1988).
interactions with other types of receptors

other types of receptors that have been implicated in
antipsychotic or antidepressant activity (see the refer-

ences cited below in parentheses) can be excluded to play
a role in the mechanism of action of risperidone because
of its relatively low affinity for these receptors (leysen et
al. 1992), e.g.,  xxxg1618xxx  (schenk et al. 1991), 5-htlc
(canton et al. 1990; meltzer and nash 1991; roth et al.
1992), 5-ht~a (meltzer and nash 1991), 5-ht 3 (de
veaugh-geiss et al. 1991), and sigma receptors (largent
et al. 1986).

further pharmacological properties of risperidone
interaction with peripheral 5-ht2 receptors

the pronounced interaction of risperidone with 5-ht2
receptors is confirmed by various 5-ht 2 receptor-mediated effects in isolated cardiovascular tissues. at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 3.2 nm, risperidone inhibits
various 5-ht-induced effects [phosphatidic acid formation in human platelets (leysen et al. 1988); contractions
in rat caudal artery and amplification of norepinephrineinduced contractions in rabbit femoral artery (janssens et
al. 1988); inositol phosphates formation in calf aorta
smooth muscle cells (leysen and pauwels 1989); and
ca 2+ mobilization in human platelets (kusumi et al.
1991)]. risperidone also inhibits the 5-ht 2 receptor-mediated contractions in rabbit puhnonary artery induced
by aggregating platelets (janssens et al. 1988).
the interaction of risperidone with peripheral 5-ht 2
receptors has also been demonstrated in in vivo experiments. risperidone appears to be a very potent antagonist of 5-ht agonist-induced responses at vascular and
bronchial 5-ht 2 receptors (sc edsos: 0.0011-0.056 mg/
kg). in rats, it inhibits expressions of 5-ht-induced vascular congestion (tryptamine- or compound 48/80-induced cyanosis of the ears and mast cell 5-ht-induced
gastric lesions) and 5-ht-induced permeability changes
of the skin (janssen et al. 1988) at doses slightly lower
than ritanserin (awouters et al. 1988). in guinea-pigs, the
compound antagonizes 5-ht-induced bronchospasms
(0.0027 mg/kg, ip; janssens et al. 1988). blockade of
bronchial and cardiovascular 5-ht 2 receptors may antagonize some effects produced by enhanced activity of
endogenous 5-ht (e.g., caused by platelet aggregation)
but is not known to result in any undesired effects.
interaction with peripheral dopamine d 2 receptors

risperidone is a very potent antagonist of apomorphineinduced emesis in dogs, irrespective of the route of administration (iv, sc and po edsos: 5.0-7.1 btg/kg;
janssen et al. 1988), presumably by blocking peripheral
d2 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. consistent with its d 2 antagonism, furthermore, risperidone also inhibits the endogenous "brake" on prolactin release
(mediated via d 2 receptors in the tuberoinfundibular system) as indicated in vivo by increased prolactin levels
(bowden et al. 1992) and in vitro by reversal of da suppressed prolactin release in rat anterior pituitary cells
(100 nm). risperidone is slightly more potent in vivo

18
than haloperidol for both types of peripheral effects (dependent on species and route of administration up to 5
times), reflecting its excellent bioavailability.
interaction with peripheral histamine h 1 receptors

functional studies in vitro and in vivo confirm the high
affinity of risperidone for histamine h~ receptors. in isolated peripheral tissues, risperidone inhibits histamineinduced contractions in guinea-pig ileum and rabbit
femoral artery from concentrations of 15 nm onwards
(janssens et al. 1988). after sc administration to rats,
risperidone affords protection from compound 48/80-induced lethality and it inhibits skin reactions induced by
passive cutaneous anaphylaxis, compound 48/80, and
histamine at sc doses ranging from 0.014 to 1.8 mg/kg
(janssen et al. 1988). the very potent 5-ht 2 antagonism
of risperidone might have contributed to its ability to
counteract the effects of compound 48/80 and passive
cutaneous anaphylaxis, both challenges being associated
with release of both histamine and 5-ht from the mast
cells. a further contribution to the inhibition of skin reactions might be expected from the hemodynamic effects
related to blockade of ~l-adrenoceptors. in guinea pigs,
risperidone is a potent antagonist of histamine-induced
bronchospasms and lethality (sc edso: 0.021-0.037 mg/
kg; janssens et al. 1988 and unpublished data). the
blockade of peripheral h~ receptors occurs at doses of
risperidone below those required for central d2 antagonism. it may reduce symptoms of allergy in sensitive patients but it is not known to be responsible for any undesired effects.
interaction with peripheral cq-adrenoceptors

in isolated tissues, risperidone antagonizes norepinephrine-induced contractions in rat caudal artery
(ic50:2.5 nm) and rabbit spleen (ics0:49 nm), and electrically stimulated contractions in rabbit ear artery (total
amount infused: 0.00125 nag), which are all thought to be
mediated via ~l-adrenoceptors (janssens et al. 1988). after sc administration to rats, risperidone blocks peripheral ~-adrenoceptors at doses that are similar to those
required for central d 2 antagonism as indicated by protection from norepinephrine-induced lethal pulmonary
hypertension (sc eds0:0.074 mg/kg; janssen et al. 1988).
blockade of peripheral ~l-adrenoceptors is primarily responsible for the cardiovascular effects of risperidone,
e.g., hypotension, decreased arteriolar resistance, and reflex tachycardia in dogs (d'aubioul et al. 1985, 1986; van
de water et al. 1985, 1992). these cardiovascular effects
show a pronounced tendency to tolerance and disappear
with chronic treatment (d'aubioul et al. 1989), as previousls/reported for  xxxd3000xxx  (hommer et al. 1984).
interaction with peripheral c~2-adrenoceptors

the interaction of risperidone with peripheral ~z2-adrenoceptors is observed at high concentrations in vitro (po-

tentiation of electrically stimulated contractions in
guinea-pig right atrium and inhibition of clonidine-induced contractions in dog saphenous vein at 390590 nm; janssens et al. 1988) and relatively high doses in
vivo (reversal of the antidiarrheal effect of clonidine at
0.67 mg/kg; janssen et al. 1988). the interaction with peripheral a2-adrenoceptors is not thought to occur at therapeutic dose levels.
additional pharmacological activities

in in vitro experiments on isolated cardiovascular and
gastrointestinal tissues (janssens et al. 1988), risperidone
has been found to inhibit ca2---induced contractions in
isolated blood vessels (rat caudal artery: 27 nm) but not
in heart (cat papillary muscle; > 24 000 nm). up to 200
times the concentration required for binding to 5-ht 2
receptors, risperidone is devoid of in vitro interaction
with a variety of binding sites: [31, [32, benzodiazepine,
 xxxg352xxx ,  xxxg353xxx , d1, h z, 5-ht1a, 5-ht~b,  xxxg1115xxx , 5htii> 5-ht3, leukotriene d4, muscarinic,  xxxg1618xxx ,
paf, ~t- or ~:-opiate,  xxxg2240xxx , nmda, thromboxane
a2, haloperidol-sensitive sigma,  xxxd3330xxx -sensitive
monoamine release, batrachotoxin sensitive na + channels,  xxxd2737xxx  sensitive ca 2+ channels (leysen et al.
1992); devoid of effect on the uptake of tritium-labelled
norepinephrine, 5-ht, da, and gaba in synaptosomal
rat brain preparations (leysen et al. 1988); devoid of
functional effects in isolated cardiovascular and gastrointestinal tissues that are characteristic for interaction
with [31, 132,5-ht3, h2, muscarinic, nicotinic, angiotensin
ii, and bradykinin receptors (janssens et al. 1988); and
devoid of effects on inositol phospholipid content or
phospholipase c activity (de chaffoy de courcelles
1988).
after in vivo administration to rats, risperidone induces palpebral ptosis, reduces acetic acid writhing, decreases body temperature, inhibits ouabain lethality, and
induces muscular hypotonia at relatively high doses (sc
eds0s: 0.19, 0.34, 2.0, 3,1, 3.6 mg/kg, respectively; janssen
et al. 1988), presumably due to non-specific depressant
effects. similar effects are observed in mice: palpebral
ptosis, sedation, protection from acetic acid writhing, and
ataxia (sc edsos: 0.39, 0.59, 0.68, 1.8 mg/kg, respectively;
megens et al. 1988b). up to 10 mg/kg in rats, risperidone
fails to affect physostigmine-, nicotine-, bac12-, or kcninduced lethality, pupil diameter, castor oil diarrhea, indomethacin- or stress-induced gastric ulcers,  xxxd102xxx induced gastric necrosis, pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsions, gastric emptying, small intestinal transit, and
the tail withdrawal response to hot water; to potentiate
the behavioral effects of 5-htp or tryptamine; and is
devoid of local anesthetic activity (janssen et al. 1988;
megens and canters 1988; megens et al. 1988b, 1993a,b;
megens and niemegeers 1990). in drug discrimination
tests (meert et al. 1990), risperidone depresses response
rate from the sc dose of 0.16 mg/kg onwards, it produces
no stimulus generalization with lsd, 8-oh-dpat, damphetamine, cocaine, chlordiazepoxide, xylazine or fentanyl (sc eds0: > 0.63 mg/kg), and it antagonizes lsd

0.31 mg/kg) and fentanyl (estimated eds0:0.41 mg/kg at
1 h but > 0.63 mg/kg at 2 h after sc administration) but
not 8-oh-dpat, xylazine, cocaine or chlordiazepoxide
(sc edso: >0.63 mg/kg). microiontophoretic application antagonizes the suppressing action of the 5-ht 2 agonist (_+)doi on medial prefrontal cortical cells but not
that elicited by the 5-ht 3 agonist 2-methylserotonin
(ashby et al. 1991). up to an oral dose of 2.0 mg/kg in
male rats~ risperidone does not affect plasma corticosterone, insulin or glucose levels (bowden and voina
1988). after repeated oral doses (10 mg/kg per day), risperidone does not consistently modify serum lh and
testosterone levels (de coster et al. 1991).

pharmacokinetic properties and metabolism of
risperidone
after oral administration, risperidone is absorbed rapidly and to a large extent in the various tested species
(table 3). risperidone is predominantly metabolized to
 xxxd2830xxx  ( xxxd2830xxx ), a racemic
mixture of two enantiomers.  xxxd2830xxx  and its
enantiomers are very comparable to their parent compound risperidone, both in in vitro receptor binding profile (leysen et al. 1991; van beijsterveldt et al. 1993) and
in in vivo pharmacological profile in rats and dogs (megens and niemegeers 1990; megens et al. 1993c; van beijsterveldt et al. 1993). the compounds show similar potency, oral activity, and onset and duration of action.
 xxxd2830xxx  shows the same features that differentiate risperidone froln haloperidol: relatively high doses
for catalepsy, gradual depression of motor activity, gradual amphetamine antagonism, and relatively pronounced
effects on amphetamine-induced oxygen consumption
(megens et al. 1993c). at the high ip dose of 40 mg/kg,
 xxxd2830xxx  and risperidone show the same profile
of behavioral effects in rats (megens and niemegeers
1990). the lethal oral doses (lds0s) obtained for both
compounds in acute toxicity studies in rats are also very
comparable (megens awouters 1993c). as the metabolic

conversion of risperidone to  xxxd2830xxx  apparently does not result in any marked change in activity profile, its major consequence seems to be a prolongation of
duration of action.
the absolute bioavailability of oral risperidone from a
solution is lower in rats (nabs: 27 and 40% for males and
females, respectively) than in dogs and m a n (nabs : 76 and
68%, respectively; table 3), presumably due to rapid biotransformation of risperidone in rats to  xxxd2830xxx  on its first pass through the liver. the terminal halflife of  xxxd2830xxx  is also much shorter in rats (tl/2:
2.0 and 3.6 h for males and females, respectively; table 3)
than in dogs and man (tl/2:18 and 22 h, respectively;
table 3), probably because of further metabolism of
risperidone in rats to dihydroxylated metabolites. the
levels of risperidone and its active metabolite in rat striaturn increase less than dose proportionally after subcutaneous administration of risperidone (van beijsterveldt et
al. 1993); both risperidone and  xxxd2830xxx  are distributed preferentially to the frontal cortex and the striatum, brain regions with high concentrations of 5-ht 2
and d 2 receptors, with half-lives that are 3 5 times longer
than in plasma.
in rats, no interaction with drug-metabolizing enzymes has been observed after repeated oral doses up to
10 mg/kg per day (lavrijsen et al. 1989). in humans, however, inhibition of risperidone metabolism has been observed with drugs that bind to cytochrome p-450iid6
(lavrijsen et al. 1993). as this will affect only the relative
amounts of risperidone and  xxxd2830xxx  and not
the total amount of active compound (risperidone +
metabolite), these drug interactions are not expected to
result in a marked change of activity. based on kinetic
parameters, furthermore, the opposite effects (of risperidone on the activity of these drugs) seem to be negligible
as well. no inhibition of risperidone metabolism has been
observed for drugs that interact with other types of cytochromes (p-450ia1, p-450ia2, p-450iic9, p-450mp,
and p-450iiia4; lavrijsen et al. 1993).

conclusion
behavioral and receptor binding studies show that risperidone is an extremely p o t e n t central 5 - h t 2 antagonist
with a b o u t a 10-fold d o m i n a n c e of central 5 - h t 2 over d 2
antagonism. behavioral studies a n d ex vivo receptor
binding studies also indicate that the dose-dependent
b l o c k a d e of central d2 receptors proceeds m o r e gradually with risperidone t h a n with haloperidol. this c o m b i n a tion of properties is likely to underly the beneficial clinical profile of risperidone. potent 5-ht2 a n t a g o n i s m in
c o m b i n a t i o n with a low degree of d 2 receptor b l o c k a d e
m a y alleviate the negative s y m p t o m s of schizophrenia. a
slightly higher degree of d 2 receptor b l o c k a d e m a y already be sufficient to control positive symptoms. the
m o r e gradual dose-dependent increase in d 2 a n t a g o n i s m
observed with risperidone m a y allow finer tuning of central d o p a m i n e r g i c activity, and thereby widen the neurological safety m a r g i n a n d the m a r g i n for effects on negative symptoms. risperidone seems to differ in this respect
f r o m conventional neuroleptics. p r e d o m i n a n t 5 - h t 2 ant a g o n i s m m a y help in counteracting eps a n d extending
therapeutic effects to s y m p t o m s that are refractory to
conventional neuroleptics. w i t h initial clinical trials suggesting that the c o m p o u n d m a y be effective against b o t h
negative a n d positive s y m p t o m s with minimal eps,
risperidone might be the p r o t o t y p e of a new class of antipsychotics.
