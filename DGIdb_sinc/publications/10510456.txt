1  xxxd1708xxx  is a prokinetic agent which has been associated with qt prolongation, torsades de
pointes and cardiac arrest. the cellular mechanism for these observations is high anity blockade of
ikr (encoded by  xxxg1246xxx ).
2 in a chronic transfection model using cho-k1 cells,  xxxd1708xxx  inhibited  xxxg1246xxx  tail currents
after a step to +25 mv with similar potency at room and physiological temperatures (ic50 16.4 nm
at 20 ± 228c and 23.6 nm at 378c).
3 channel inhibition exhibited time-, voltage- and frequency-dependence. in an envelope of tails
test, channel blockade increased from 27+8% after a 120 ms depolarizing step to 50+4% after a
1.0 s step. these ®ndings suggested anity for open and/or inactivated channel states.
4 inactivation was signi®cantly accelerated by  xxxd1708xxx  in a concentration-dependent manner and
there was a small (77 mv) shift in the voltage dependence of steady state inactivation.
5 channel blockade by  xxxd1708xxx  was modulated by [k+]o, with a 26% reduction in the potency of
channel blockade when [k+]o was increased from 1 to 10 mm.
6 in conclusion,  xxxg1246xxx  channel inhibition by  xxxd1708xxx  exhibits features consistent with open and
inactivated state binding and is sensitive to external potassium concentration. these features may
have signi®cant clinical implications with regard to the mechanism and treatment of cisaprideinduced proarrhythmia.

introduction
 xxxd1708xxx  is a gastroprokinetic agent used clinically in the
treatment of dyspepsia, gastroparesis, and gastro-oesophageal
re¯ux (wiseman & faulds, 1994). recently, it has been
associated with qt prolongation, syncope, serious ventricular
arrhythmias (including torsades de pointes) and cardiac arrest
(wysowski & bacsanyi, 1996; fda talk paper, 1998). these
complications generally occur in patients administered high
doses (bran et al., 1995) or taking concurrent cytochrome
p450-inhibiting medications such as ketoconazole or itraconazole (ahmad & wolfe, 1995; hoover et al., 1996).  xxxd1708xxx 
causes prolongation of action potential duration (in a reverse
use-dependent manner), and early after depolarizations in
isolated rabbit purkinje ®bres (puisieux et al., 1996; drolet et
al., 1998), and action potential prolongation in guinea-pig
isolated papillary muscle (kii & ito, 1997).
repolarization of cardiac ventricular myocytes is due
mainly to outward potassium currents, the most important
of which is the delayed recti®er  xxxg1232xxx , (ik), which
has two components, ikr and iks (sanguinetti & jurkiewicz,

*author for correspondence at: department of medicine, st
vincent's hospital, darlinghurst, nsw 2010, australia;
e-mail: b.walker@garvan.unsw.edu.au

1990). drugs which are associated with qt prolongation and
torsades de pointes commonly act by inhibiting ikr, which is
encoded by the human ether-a-go-go-related gene ( xxxg1246xxx ;
curran et al., 1995; sanguinetti et al., 1995). recent studies
have shown that  xxxd1708xxx  inhibits ikr in rabbit and guinea-pig
ventricular myocytes with similar potency (ic50 9 nm, carlsson
et al., 1997; ic50 15 nm, drolet et al., 1998).  xxxd1708xxx  also
causes potent, voltage-dependent inhibition of the channel
activity produced by transient transfection with  xxxg1246xxx  (ic50
6.5 nm, mohammad et al., 1997; ic50 44.5 nm, rampe et al.,
1997).  xxxg1246xxx  inhibition by  xxxd1708xxx  required channel
activation and the above authors concluded that  xxxd1708xxx  has
a predominant anity for the open and/or inactivated states of
the  xxxg1246xxx  channel.
we have recently reported that chinese hamster ovary
(cho-k1) cells stably transfected with  xxxg1246xxx  express a
delayed recti®er k+ channel with properties very similar to ikr
(walker et al., 1999). the experiments reported below were
designed to con®rm  xxxd1708xxx  blockade in this model and to
characterize its voltage- and time-dependence and any
modulation of channel kinetics with a view to further
elucidating the mechanisms of blockade. since there is a
disparity in the potency of  xxxg1246xxx  channel blockade at room
temperature (20 ± 228c) and the human therapeutic plasma

concentration, we evaluated the eects of temperature and
[k+]o on blockade by  xxxd1708xxx .

methods
molecular biology
the cho-k1 cells (american type culture collection,
bethesda, md, u.s.a.) used in the following experiments
were maintained in dulbecco's modi®ed eagle's medium-f12
(dmem-f12, gibco, brl, gaithersburg, md, u.s.a.),
supplemented with 5% foetal calf serum. eukaryotic expres-

sion of  xxxg1246xxx  was performed by directionally cloning the
coding region of the  xxxg1246xxx  gene (gift from dr g. robertson,
department of physiology, university of wisconsin medical
school, madison, wi, u.s.a.) into the expression vector prc/
cmv (invitrogen, san diego, ca, u.s.a.), which also carries
the  xxxg418xxx  resistance gene. this construct was then transfected
into cho-k1 cells. cell monolayers in 35 mm2 dishes were
transfected using 9 ml lipofectamine reagent (gibco, brl)
and 1 mg dna. stably transfected cells were then selected with
1000 mg ml71  xxxg418xxx  (boehringer, mannheim). these were
subcloned to isolate individual cell clones which expressed
substantial  xxxg1246xxx -related k+ current. individual subclones
were maintained long-term in tissue culture and used for the
patch clamping experiments to be described below.

electrophysiology
currents were recorded from cho-k1 cells at room
temperature (20 ± 228c) and at 378c, using the whole-cell
patch-clamp technique. cho-k1 cells plated on coverslips
were placed at the bottom of a 2 ml perfusion chamber
mounted on the stage of an inverted phase contrast microscope
(nikon diaphot, nikon corporation, tokyo, japan). electrodes were positioned using a micromanipulator (narishige
wb 90, tokyo, japan). a silver/silver-chloride reference
electrode was either placed directly in the perfusion chamber
or in a separate chamber connected by a salt bridge.
membrane potentials were adjusted by 715 mv to correct
for the junction potential between high k+ pipette and
external bath solution (calculated using commercial software,
jpcalc, barry, 1994). cells were patched using micropipettes
fabricated from thin-walled borosilicate glass (vitrex microhematocrit tubes, modulohm i/s, denmark) with a vertical
pipette puller (model 720, david kopf instruments, ca,
u.s.a.). currents were ampli®ed and ®ltered at 2 khz with a 4
pole bessel ®lter (73db point) using an axopatch 1d
ampli®er (axon instruments, foster city, ca, u.s.a.).
stimulation protocols and data acquisition were carried out
using a microcomputer (ibm pentium), running commercial
software and hardware (pclamp 6.0/digidata 1200, axon
instruments inc and scienti®c solutions inc.).

whole-cell capacitance was determined from capacitative
transient decay in current recordings following voltage steps of
+10 mv from the holding potential. at least 80% series
resistance compensation was achieved in all reported experiments. leak subtraction was performed in some experiments
by applying three hyperpolarizing pre-pulses before the test
pulses (p/3 subtraction protocol).

solutions and drugs
the intracellular pipette solution contained (mm): k gluconate
120, kcl 20, mgatp 1.5, egta 5, n-2-hydroxylethylpiperazine-n1-2-ethanesulphonic acid (hepes) 10, adjusted to
ph 7.3. the superfusion solution contained (mm): nacl 130,
kcl 4.8, mgcl2 1.2, nah2po4 1.2, hepes 10, glucose 12.5,
cacl2 1.0, adjusted to a ph of 7.4.  xxxd1708xxx  was purchased
from janssen biotech (olem, belgium) and was prepared as
stock solution in dimethyl sulphoxide (dmso) and subsequently diluted as required with superfusate (maximum ®nal
dmso concentration=0.1% v v71). in preliminary experiments, we determined that dmso 0.1% v v71 had no eect on
the parameters under study.

statistics
current analysis was performed using the clamp®t module of
the pclamp software. data are expressed as mean+s.e. for n
experiments. statistical analyses were performed using prism
2.0 (graphpad software, san diego, ca, u.s.a.). unpaired ttests were used for comparisons of two groups and repeated

results
 xxxg1246xxx  channel inhibition by  xxxd1708xxx 
 xxxg1246xxx -transfected cho-k1 cells produce currents (` xxxg1246xxx 
currents') with biophysical properties similar to those of
 xxxg1246xxx -transfected xenopus oocytes reported by previous
investigators (mcdonald et al., 1997; walker et al., 1999).
current-voltage relations and activation kinetics were
determined using step depolarizations to potentials between
735 and +25 mv from a holding potential of 775 mv.
currents were recorded in control conditions and during
steady state blockade maintained by 0.1 hz stimulation in

the presence of 10 nm  xxxd1708xxx  (figure 1a,b).  xxxd1708xxx  in
concentrations of 1 nm to 10 mm, caused, potent, concentration-dependent inhibition of tail currents at +25 mv, with
an ic50 of 16.4 nm (95% ci 11.0724.4 nm) and hill
coecient of 70.8+0.1 (figure 1c, n=8) at 20 ± 228c.
figure 1d demonstrates that channel inhibition was equally
potent at 378c (ic50 23.6, 95% ci 20.7 ± 27.0, hill coecient
70.8+0.1, n=4 ± 7). the voltage required to half-maximally
activate  xxxg1246xxx  (v1/2), was shifted from 721.7+1.2 mv in
controls to 729.3+1.4 mv by exposure to 10 nm  xxxd1708xxx 
(p50.01, n=9), and slope factors were not signi®cantly
dierent (9.2+1.1 in controls and 8.3+1.3 after  xxxd1708xxx ,
figure 1e). tail current inhibition was voltage-dependent,
increasing from 12+8% at 725 mv to 44+7% at +35 mv
(p50.05, n=9, figure 1f).

frequency dependence of channel blockade
we have previously demonstrated that  xxxg1246xxx  tail current
amplitude remains stable at stimulation frequencies of 0.1 and
0.5 hz in control conditions and that  xxxd2884xxx  maleate
exhibits frequency-dependent tail current inhibition (walker et
al., 1999). to examine the eects of pulse frequency on channel
binding by  xxxd1708xxx , tail currents were measured at 755 mv,
after each of a train of 500 ms voltage steps to +15 mv,
delivered at frequencies of 0.5 and 0.1 hz. in the presence of
10 nm  xxxd1708xxx , channel blockade increased signi®cantly with
stimulation frequency from 23+5% after 40 pulses at 0.1 hz
to 47+6% after the same number of pulses at 0.5 hz,
(p50.01, n=10, figure 2).

kinetics of current blockade
development of channel blockade during depolarization was
assessed using an envelope of tails protocol, in which peak tail
current amplitude was measured at 755 mv, following
depolarizing pulses to +25 mv which varied in duration from
40 ms to 1.0 s (figure 3). blockade by  xxxd1708xxx  10 nm
increased with pulse duration from 27+8% after a 120 ms
depolarizing step to 50+4% after a 1.0 s step (p50.01, n=7,
figure 3b,c). the time course of block development was well
®tted by a single exponential function (mean t 383 ms, 95% ci
336 ± 444 ms, n=7).
to determine the time course of recovery from channel
blockade by  xxxd1708xxx  10 nm, a 500 ms depolarizing prepulse
to +25 mv was followed by a step back to 795 mv of
variable duration (0.5 ± 240 s). tail currents were then
measured at 755 mv following a second depolarizing pulse
of identical duration and amplitude to the ®rst (figure 4).
recovery from channel inhibition reached 83+3% of the
control current after a 4 min hyperpolarizing step. the time
course of recovery was ®tted with a single exponential function
yielding a mean t of 7.1 s (95% ci 5.9 ± 8.5 s, n=7, figure
4c,d).

modulation of channel kinetics by  xxxd1708xxx 
 xxxg1246xxx  channel blockade by  xxxd1708xxx  exhibited time, voltageand frequency-dependence, which suggested greatest anity
for either open or inactivated channel states. we studied the
eects of  xxxd1708xxx  10 nm on the time course of channel
figure 5 modulation of the time course of inactivation and recovery
from inactivation by  xxxd1708xxx  10 nm. (a) currents were recorded
after a 500 ms depolarization to +25 mv, followed by a 20 ms
hyperpolarizing step to 7125 mv to relieve rapid inactivation, then a
second depolarization to potentials between 735 and +25 mv
(inset). inactivation time constants were determined by ®tting a single
exponential function to the tail currents elicited by the second
depolarizing step. time constants of inactivation were accelerated in
the presence of  xxxd1708xxx  at most potentials. (b) recovery from
inactivation was determined by ®tting a single exponential function
to the initial `hook' preceding slower deactivation of tail currents
elicited by stepping to potentials between 7115 and 715 mv
following a 500 ms depolarization to +25 mv (inset). after superfusion with  xxxd1708xxx , there was no change in the time course of
recovery from inactivation for potentials in the physiological range
(n=8). (c) voltage-dependence of steady state inactivation. following
a 1 s step to +30 mv, 20 ms pulses were applied to potentials
between 7120 and +40 mv, followed by a second 1 s step to
+30 mv. current amplitudes elicited by the second step to +30 mv
were plotted as a function of the potential of the preceding 20 ms
step and were ®tted with a boltzmann function. after  xxxd1708xxx 
10 nm, there was a *7 mv shift in the voltage-dependence of steady
state inactivation (v1/2 765.6+0.9 mv in controls and
773.4+1.0 mv after  xxxd1708xxx , p50.05, n=4). slope factors did
not dier signi®cantly between traces.

depolarized to 0 mv for 5 s from a holding potential of 780 mv,
then to +80 mv for another 5 s to induce full inactivation, followed
by a pulse to 0 mv for 5 s. current traces under control conditions
(a) and after superfusion with  xxxd1708xxx  100 nm (b) are demonstrated.
interrupted lines represent single exponential ®ts to current traces
before and after the step to +80 mv. after  xxxd1708xxx , current decay

activation, deactivation and inactivation. activation time
constants were obtained by ®tting a single exponential function
to activating currents as seen in figure 1. time constants of
deactivation were obtained by ®tting a double exponential
function to the deactivating tail currents as seen in figure 1.
 xxxd1708xxx  did not signi®cantly change the time course of
channel activation or deactivation at any concentration or
potential.
a `dual-pulse' protocol (smith et al., 1996; spector et al.,
1996) was used to assess channel inactivation. currents were
recorded after a 500 ms depolarization to +25 mv from a
holding potential of 775 mv, followed by a 20 ms
hyperpolarizing step to 7125 mv to relieve rapid inactivation,
then a second depolarization to potentials between 735 and
+25 mv. the time course for the onset of inactivation was
determined by ®tting a single exponential function to the tail
current elicited after the second depolarizing step (figure 5a,
inset). in the presence of  xxxd1708xxx  10 nm, there was a
signi®cant acceleration in the time course of current
inactivation at most potentials (figure 5a). at 725 mv, the
time constants for inactivation were 14.5+1.1 ms (control),
11.8+0.4 ms ( xxxd1708xxx  10 nm), and 7.2+1.6 ms ( xxxd1708xxx 
10 mm) (p50.05, n=3 ± 8). recovery from inactivation was
determined by ®tting a single exponential function to the initial
`hook' preceding slower deactivation of tail currents elicited by
stepping to potentials between 7115 and 715 mv following a
500 ms depolarization to +25 mv (figure 5b, inset). after

 xxxd1708xxx  inhibits  xxxg1246xxx  channels

 xxxd1708xxx , there was no signi®cant change in the time course of
recovery from inactivation at any potential (figure 5b).
to determine the eects of  xxxd1708xxx  on the voltage
dependence of steady state inactivation, we used a protocol
similar to that initially described by smith et al. (1996).
following a 1 s step to +30 mv, 20 ms pulses were applied to
potentials between 7120 and +40 mv, followed by a second
1 s step to +30 mv. the amplitude of the currents elicited by
the second step to +30 mv was plotted as a function of the
potential of the preceding 20 ms step and data points were
®tted with boltzmann functions. after  xxxd1708xxx  10 nm, there
was a shift in the voltage-dependence of half maximal
inactivation from 765.6+0.9 mv in controls to
773.4+1.0 mv after  xxxd1708xxx  (p50.01, n=4), without a
signi®cant change to the slope factor (716.6+0.8 in controls
and 715.7+0.9 after  xxxd1708xxx , figure 5c).
we further studied the state-dependence of channel
blockade using a protocol similar to that described by kiehn
et al. (1996). after superfusion with  xxxd1708xxx  100 nm for
2 min, cells were depolarized to 0 mv for 5 s from a holding
potential of 780 mv, then to +80 mv for another 5 s,
followed by a pulse to 0 mv for 5 s. the representative trace in
figure 6 shows that current decay in the presence of  xxxd1708xxx 
started during the initial step to 0 mv, at which channels
would exist in open and inactivated states. current inhibition
continued to develop during the step to +80 mv, during
which virtually all channels would be inactivated, without a
signi®cant delay imposed on current decay. similar results
were obtained in another four dierent cells.

eect of external potassium concentration on block by
 xxxd1708xxx 
 xxxg1246xxx  channel inactivation, recovery from inactivation and
voltage dependence of inactivation are known to be highly
sensitive to [k+]o (wang et al., 1997a). several recent reports
have shown that blockade of  xxxg1246xxx  channels and/or ikr by
quinidine or dofetilide is enhanced by low [k+] in the
superfusate and reduced by high [k+] (yang & roden 1996;
wang et al., 1997b; west et al., 1997). we therefore assessed
the eect of [k+]o on  xxxg1246xxx  channel blockade by  xxxd1708xxx 
30 nm. at this concentration there was a modest, but
statistically signi®cant eect seen, with current inhibition
decreasing from 65+3% in 1 mm [k+]o to 51+3% in 10 mm
[k+]o (p50.05, n=7).

discussion

figure 7 chemical structures of  xxxd1708xxx , haloperidol and terfenadine.

we have con®rmed that  xxxd1708xxx  blocks  xxxg1246xxx  currents in a
chronically transfected cho-k1 cell model with similar
potency (ic50 16.4 nm), to that recently reported for inhibition
of ikr in mammalian ventricular myocytes (carlsson et al.,
1997; drolet et al., 1998) as well as  xxxg1246xxx  channels
transfected into hek 293 and mouse l cell lines (mohammad
et al., 1997; rampe et al., 1997). the ic50 for  xxxg1246xxx  channel
inhibition by  xxxd1708xxx  is an order of magnitude lower than
peak plasma concentrations seen in patients receiving
therapeutic doses of the drug (150 ± 300 nm; wiseman &
faulds, 1994; hofmeyr & sonnendecker 1986). the drug is
however more than 95% bound to plasma proteins which may
well explain much of this discrepancy.
an alternative explanation for this dierence is that
temperature may in¯uence the potency of  xxxg1246xxx  channel
inhibition by  xxxd1708xxx . however, our experiments showed that
the potency of  xxxg1246xxx  channel inhibition by  xxxd1708xxx  was not

b.d. walker et al

signi®cantly dierent at room temperature and at 378c. the
potency of channel blockade by an agent may also vary
between native currents and those expressed in cultured cell
lines. although the eects of  xxxd1708xxx  on human ikr have not
been studied, others have reported that  xxxd1708xxx  inhibits ikr in
rabbit and guinea-pig ventricular myocytes (carlsson et al.,
1997; drolet et al., 1998) with similar potency to inhibition of
 xxxg1246xxx  channels (mohammad et al., 1997; rampe et al., 1997).

state dependence of  xxxg1246xxx  blockade by  xxxd1708xxx 
previous authors have suggested that  xxxd1708xxx  binds to open
or inactivated  xxxg1246xxx  channels on the basis of the observations
that blockade required channel activation and was enhanced
by prolonged depolarizing steps (rampe et al., 1997,
mohammad et al., 1997). as well as con®rming this, we found
that channel inhibition by  xxxd1708xxx  was voltage-dependent,
increasing at positive potentials, and was associated with a
small (*7 mv) hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage-dependence of activation.
use- and frequency-dependent blockade indicate greater
anity for an activated or inactivated channel state (carmeliet
& mubagwa, 1998). we observed that channel inhibition by
 xxxd1708xxx  was frequency-dependent (degree of blockade
increased 2 fold when pulse frequency rose from 0.1 to
0.5 hz). this frequency-dependence suggests that the drug
binds suciently slowly so as not to reach equilibrium during
the ®rst depolarizing step and that recovery from blockade
takes place over a period that allows partial unbinding from
the channel (carmeliet & mubagwa, 1998). using an envelope
of tails protocol to con®rm this hypothesis, we found that the
development of channel blockade occurred with a time
constant of 383 ms. in figure 4, recovery from channel
blockade is shown to occur with a time constant of 7.1 s,
consistent with relatively slow dissociation from the channel
during the closed state.
this voltage- and frequency-dependence of  xxxg1246xxx  channel
inhibition suggested that  xxxd1708xxx  binds preferentially to open
and/or inactivated channel states (rampe et al., 1997; toyama
et al., 1997; seussbrich et al., 1997). to further characterize
this state dependence, we assessed the eects of  xxxd1708xxx  on
the kinetics of activation, deactivation and inactivation of the
 xxxg1246xxx  channel. the drug had no eect on activation or
deactivation, and we saw no evidence of recovery from channel
blockade by  xxxd1708xxx  during the course of tail current decay.
we did however, ®nd evidence of  xxxd1708xxx  interaction with
the inactivated state of the channel. the time course of
inactivation was accelerated by  xxxd1708xxx  in a concentrationdependent manner at potentials within the range of normal
channel activation. in addition, there was a small (*7 mv)
hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage-dependence of inactivation. this re¯ects a reduction in channel availability and
eectively produces enhanced inward recti®cation (smith et
al., 1996). to further investigate drug binding to the
inactivated state,  xxxg1246xxx  channels were driven into the fully
inactivated state by depolarizing to +80 mv in the course of a
prolonged step to 0 mv (figure 6). our observation that
channel decay was not signi®cantly slowed during the step to
+80 mv, suggests that some of the current decay seen during
these prolonged steps is due to slow development of drug
binding to the inactivated channel state. our ®ndings were
quite dierent from those reported for the same protocol with
dofetilide (kiehn et al., 1996; snyders & chaudhary, 1996).

dofetilide preferentially binds to open channels and development of block ceases during the step to +80 mv. we conclude
from these observations that  xxxd1708xxx  exhibits anity for both
open and inactivated  xxxg1246xxx  channel states.

structure function relationships
 xxxd1708xxx  shares structural similarities with a number of other
 xxxg1246xxx  channel blocking agents, which have in common a
basic amine group bonded to a substituted phenyl ring by a
variable linking group, the length of which relates directly to
the potency of channel blockade (morgan & sullivan, 1992;
carlsson et al., 1997).  xxxd1708xxx  has a four atom linking group
which is almost identical to the analagous group in haloperidol
and similar to that of terfenadine (figure 7), both of which are
potent  xxxg1246xxx  channel blockers (roy et al., 1996; seussbrich et
al., 1996; 1997). mosapride, a prokinetic agent with similar
pharmacodynamic properties to  xxxd1708xxx , has only a single
carbon linking group between the amine and the phenyl ring
and is a very weak blocker of the ikr channel (carlsson et al.,
1997). this structural similarity, plus the fact that haloperidol
has been shown to bind selectively to the inactivated state of
the  xxxg1246xxx  channel and to bind much less potently to a  xxxg1246xxx 
mutant (s631a), in which the inactivation mechanism is
disrupted (seussbrich et al., 1997), supports our hypothesis
that some of the  xxxg1246xxx  channel blockade due to  xxxd1708xxx 
results from binding to the inactivated state of the channel.

sensitivity to external potassium
finally, our observation that the potency of channel blockade
by  xxxd1708xxx  is modulated by external potassium concentration
is consistent with recent reports of a similar phenomenon for
dofetilide and quinidine (yang & roden 1996; west et al.,
1997). elevation of [k+]o destabilizes c-type inactivation,
causing an increase in the time course of inactivation, as well as
shifting the voltage-dependence of steady state inactivation to
more depolarized potentials (smith et al., 1996; wang et al.,
1997a). regardless of the mechanism, our observation is of
obvious clinical signi®cance, suggesting increased sensitivity to
 xxxg1246xxx  channel blockade in the presence of hypokalaemia and
a possible therapeutic role for intravenous potassium in
treating drug-induced qt prolongation and torsades de
pointes associated with  xxxd1708xxx  as previously reported for
quinidine toxicity (choy et al., 1997).

conclusions
 xxxd1708xxx  inhibited  xxxg1246xxx  channels at a potency below the
human therapeutic concentration at room temperature and at
378c. channel inhibition was time-, voltage- and frequencydependent, and was accompanied by small hyperpolarizing
shifts in the voltage-dependence of channel activation and
inactivation. these data suggest that  xxxd1708xxx  has anity for
both open and inactivated channel states. we have also shown
that channel inhibition is modi®ed by external potassium
concentration, an eect which has obvious clinical implications.
