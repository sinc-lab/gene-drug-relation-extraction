abstract
the efficacy of each antidepressant available has been found equal to that of amitriptyline in double-blind
studies as far as mild to moderate depression is involved. however, it seems that some antidepressants are more
effective than others in the treatment of severe types of depression (i.e., delusional depression and refractory
depression). following studies regarding the antinociceptive mechanisms of various antidepressants, we speculate that the involvement of the opioid system in the antidepressants’ mechanism of action may be necessary,
in order to prove effective in the treatment of severe depression. among the antidepressants of the newer generations, that involvement occurs only with venlafaxine (a presynaptic drug which blocks the synaptosomal
uptake of noradrenaline and serotonin and, to a lesser degree, of dopamine) and with mirtazapine (a postsynaptic drug which enhances noradrenergic and 5-ht1a-mediated serotonergic neurotransmission via antagonism of central  xxxg831xxx -auto- and hetero-adrenoreceptors). when mice were tested with a hotplate analgesia meter,
both venlafaxine and mirtazapine induced a dose-dependent, naloxone-reversible antinociceptive effect following ip administration. summing up the various interactions of venlafaxine and mirtazapine with opioid,
noradrenergic and serotonergic agonists and antagonists, we found that the antinociceptive effect of venlafaxine is influenced by opioid receptor subtypes (µ-, kappa1- kappa3- and delta-opioid receptor subtypes) combined with the
 xxxg831xxx -adrenergic receptor, whereas the antinociceptive effect of mirtazapine mainly involves µ- and kappa3-opioid
mechanisms. this opioid profile of the two drugs may be one of the explanations to their efficacy in severe
depression, unlike the ssris and other antidepressants which lack opioid activity.

introduction
delusional depression is a unique subtype of
depressive illness, so far the only biologically characterized separate category of severe depression
(finlay et al., 1993; coryell, 1997; montgomery &
lecrubier, 1999). psychotically depressed patients
respond poorly to antidepressants alone, and
remission is frequently achieved with combined

neuroleptic-antidepressants or electroconvulsive therapy (dubovsky & thomas, 1992; coryell,
1996; schreiber & lerer, 1997). although the efficacy of each antidepressant available has been
found equal to that of amitriptyline in double
blind studies as far as mild to moderate depression
is involved, it seems that some antidepressants
are more effective than others in the treatment of
severe types of depression, such as delusional

depression (dubovsky & thomas, 1992; coryell,
1996).
in previous studies we evaluated the antinociceptive effects and the interaction of antidepressants
with the opioid system in mice. we found that among
the antidepressants of the newer generations, that
involvement occurs with venlafaxine and mirtazapine, but neither with the post-synaptic serotonergic antidepressant nefazodone (pick et al., 1992) nor
with the pre-synaptic selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (ssris) (schreiber et al., 1996a,b), or with
the reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxydase
(rima) moclobemide (schreiber et al., 1998).
venlafaxine is a structurally novel phentylethylamine antidepressant drug. in vitro, venlafaxine
blocks the synaptosomal uptake of noradrenaline
and serotonin and, to a lesser degree, of dopamine
(lloyd et al., 1992). venlafaxine has not been shown
to inhibit mao (muth et al., 1986) and its
monoamine-inhibitory properties differ from those
of the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors, which
show high selectivity for serotonin reuptake only
(mendlewicz, 1995). moreover, venlafaxine is inactive as a ligand in vitro to  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -,  xxxg831xxx -adrenoreceptors,
muscarinic and histaminergic receptors (muth et al.,
1986; moyer et al., 1992; ellingrod & perry, 1994;
richelson, 1996). when studied in the mouse hot
plate assay, venlafaxine was found to exert a clear,
dose-dependent, opioid-mediated antinociceptive
effect (schreiber et al., 1999).
mirtazapine is a new antidepressant, one of a
chemical series of compounds known as piperazinoazepines which is not related to any known class
of psychotropic drugs. mirtazapine enhances
noradrenergic and 5-ht1a-mediated serotonergic
neurotransmission via antagonism of central
 xxxg831xxx -auto- and hetero-adrenoreceptors (de boer, 2000;
besson et al., 2000). mirtazapine does not inhibit
noradrenaline or serotonin uptake, but, it blocks
specifically the 5-ht2 and 5-ht3 type receptors, failing to modulate monoamine reuptake. in these
models mirtazapine manifested a very low affinity
for dopaminergic receptors and high affinity for histamine h1 receptors (de boer, 2000). however, it
seems that mirtazapine’s intrinsic noradrenergic
activity counteracts its histaminergic effects (de boer,
2000). when studied in the mouse hot plate assay,
mirtazapine was found to exert an opioid-mediated
antinociceptive effect with a “therapeutic window”
pattern (schreiber et al., submitted).
venlafaxine and mirtazapine act at different sides
of the neuronal synapses: venlafaxine, being a reuptake inhibitor of noradrenaline, serotonin, and

dopamine, is a presynaptic drug, whereas mirtazapine exerts its pharmacological action at postsynaptic receptors. in common, these drugs seem to
have only two characteristics: both drugs are effective in the treatment of severe depression and both
drugs have been found to involve opioid mechanisms of antinociception. combining the findings
of these two observations we speculate that the
involvement of the opioid system in the antidepressant mechanism of action may be necessary, in
order to prove effective in the treatment of severe
depression.

materials and methods
subjects and surgery
male icr mice from tel-aviv university colony
(tel-aviv, israel), weight 25–35 g were used. the mice
were maintained on 12 h light⬊12 h dark cycles with
purina rodent chow and water available ad libitum.
animals were housed five per cage in a room maintained at 22°c ± 0.5°c until testing. mice were used
only once. central injections in mice were made
under light halothane anesthesia, using a hamilton
10 µl syringe fitted to a 30-g needle with v1 tubing.
intrathecal (it) injections were introduced by lumbar
puncture (hylden & wilcox, 1980).

several agents were generously donated as follows: venlafaxine hcl by dexon (hadera, israel),
mirtazapine by n. v. organon, (the netherlands),
morphine by teva (jerusalem, israel), naloxonazine by dr. g. w. pasternak from memorial

venlafaxine and mirtazapine
antinociception assessment
mice were tested with the hotplate analgesimeter
model 35d (iitc inc., woodland hills, ca), as previously described (schreiber, et al., 1999). the device
basically consists of a metal plate (40 × 35 cm) heated
to a constant temperature, on which a plastic cylinder was placed. the analgesia meter was set to a
plate temperature of 55.5 ± 0.5°c. the time of latency
was recorded between the second the animal was
placed on the hotplate surface until it licked its back
paw or jerked it strongly or jumped out. baseline
latency was determined before experimental treatment for each mouse as the mean of two trials. posttreatment latencies were determined after 30 min for
opioids, which were subcutaneously (sc) administrated and for venlafaxine and mirtazapine, which
were ip administrated. posttreatment latencies were
determinate after 15 min for dpdpe, which was
administrated i.t. to minimize tissue damage a cutoff time of 30 s was adopted. antinociception was
defined quantitatively as doubling of baseline values
for each mouse.
procedure
the study was conducted in three experiments
for each drug.
experiment 1
in the first stage of the study, groups of mice
(n = 10) were injected ip with different doses of venlafaxine (from 1 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg) or mirtazapine (from 1 mg/kg to 12.5 mg/kg) to determine the
effect of the drugs in eliciting antinociception.
normal motor behavior was observed following
venlafaxine or mirtazapine injection.
experiment 2
the sensitivity of venlafaxine or mirtazapine to
specific opioid, adrenoreceptor, and  xxxg1108xxx   xxxg1110xxx   xxxg1113xxx   xxxg1114xxx   xxxg1115xxx   xxxg1117xxx   xxxg1119xxx  antagonists was examined.
experiment 3
the sensitivity of venlafaxine or mirtazapine to
specific opioid, adrenergic, and serotonin-receptor
agonists was examined.
statistic analysis
dose-response curves were analyzed, using a spss
computer program. this program maximizes the
log-likelihood function to fit a parallel set of gaussian normal sigmoid curves to the dose-response data.
single dose antagonist studies were analyzed using
the fisher exact test.

results
venlafaxine and mirtazapine
antinociceptive effects
both venlafaxine and mirtazapine demonstrated
in mice efficacy as antinociceptive agents in the
hotplate assay (fig. 1). venlafaxine induced a dosedependent analgesic effect following ip administration. the ed50 for mice in the hotplate assay for
venlafaxine was 46.7 mg/kg (20.5; 146.5; 95% cl). mirtazapine administered ip produced in doses from 1 to
7.5 mg/kg, an antinociceptive effect in the hotplate
test in a dose dependent manner. as the mirtazapine
dose increased beyond 10 mg/kg, hotplate latencies
declined, yielding a biphasic dose-response curve.
the sensitivity of venlafaxine and mirtazapine
antinociception to selective opioid
receptor antagonists
the antinociceptive effect of venlafaxine
(30 mg/kg) and of mirtazapine (7.5 mg/kg) were
antagonized by naloxone (1 mg/kg s.c.; p < 0.05),
implying that there is an opioid mechanism of action
involved in both drugs induced antinociceptive
effect (fig. 2). at the next stage the involvement of
the selective antagonists of µ, delta, and kappa1 receptors was
assessed to evaluate the potential involvement in
venlafaxine or mirtazapine antinociception. we
examined several selective antagonists (fig. 2).

schreiber, bleich, and pick
onazine (at the same dose needed to reverse morphine analgesia) and naltrindole (at the same dose
of that reversed dpdpe analgesia) reverse only partially venlafaxine antinociceptive effect.
the doses of naltrindole and norbni that receptively reversed dpdpe and u50,488h analgesia
reversed the antinociceptive effect of mirtazapine
(p < 0.05; fig. 2). beta-fna and naloxonazine given at
a dose, which blocked morphine analgesia, failed to
antagonized mirtazapine antinociceptive effects
(fig. 2). the activity of each of the antagonists was
confirmed with its prototypic agonists (data not
shown). none of the antagonists mediated antinociception by themselves, nor did they change the baseline latencies of the pretreated animals.
the sensitivity of venlafaxine antinociceptive
effect to selective antagonists implies kappa1-mechanisms
of action and to a lesser extent µ- and delta-opioid mechanisms whereas the sensitivity of mirtazapine
antinociceptive effect to selective antagonists implies
delta- and kappa1-opioid mechanisms of action and to a lesser
extent, a µ-mechanism.

naltrindole (nalt; 10 mg/kg), nor- bni (10 mg/kg), yohimbine (yoh; 4 mg/kg) and metergoline (met; 2 mg/kg).
groups of mice (n = 10) were treated with venlafaxine
(30 mg/kg) or with mirtazapine (7.5 mg/kg) each of them
alone or were challenged in addition with one of the additional drugs. naloxone, naltrindole, nor- bni, yohimbine
and metergoline significantly antagonized mirtazapine
antinociception (p < 0.05). all other drugs did not antagonized mirtazapine antinociception.

administered 24 h prior to testing, beta-fna(40 mg/kg,
sc) was found to be a selective µ1 and µ2 antagonist,
while naloxonazine (35 mg/kg, sc) was found to be
a selective µ1 antagonist (paul & pasternak, 1988).
similarly, the delta selective antagonist naltrindole (20
mg/kg, sc) blocks delta analgesia (paul & pasternak,
1988) and norbni (10 mg/kg, sc) is a selective kappa1
antagonist (takemori et al., 1988). all these antagonists do not mediate antinociception by themselves
and do not change the latencies of the baselines of
the pretreated animals.

antinociceptive effects to selective
opioid receptor agonists
in the next stage, multiple doses of the selective
agonist of the µ subtype morphine were coadministrated with vehicle or with an inactive (subthreshold) dose of venlafaxine (2.5 mg/kg, ip) or
inactive dose of mirtazapine (0.25 mg, ip table 1).
the ed50 of morphine alone was 5.4 mg/kg. a significant (p < .005) shift to the left in the dose-response
curve was observed following venlafaxine administration with an ed50 of 2.4 mg/kg. morphine, which
was given in addition to mirtazapine, shifted significantly the dose-response to the left with an ed50
of 1.3 mg/kg (p < .005).
various doses of the selective agonist of the delta subtype dpdpe were injected with or without an inactive dose of venlafaxine (table 1). threefold shift to
the left in the dose-response curve was detected
(p < .005) ed50 of dpdpe without venlafaxine was
393 ng (it) and with venlafaxine was 130 ng, it. when
we gave the selective agonists of the delta subtype
dpdpe with or without an inactive dose of mirtazapine, no significant differences were found
between the groups. the ed50 of dpdpe with mirtazapine was 276 ng, it.

found a threefold shift to the left in the dose-response

these results suggest that venlafaxine when administered together with opiates, significantly potentates
antinociception mediated by µ, delta, kappa1, and kappa3 opioid
receptor subtypes. mirtazapine significantly potentate’s antinociception mediated by µ and kappa3 and to a
lesser extent, by delta and kappa1 opioid receptors.

antinociceptive effects to selective opioid

in order to assess the involvement of the serotonergic and adrenergic systems in venlafaxine and
mirtazapine antinociceptive effect, the effect of  xxxd2914xxx  (a  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx - xxxg831xxx  adrenergic antagonist), yohimbine
(a  xxxg831xxx  adrenergic antagonist) and metergoline (a nonselective 5-ht receptor antagonist), were examined
to establish their ability to block venlafaxine and
mirtazapine antinociception (fig. 2). the antinocijournal of molecular neuroscience

ception induced by venlafaxine was significantly
inhibited only by yohimbine (at the same dose
needed to reverse clonidine antinociception; p < 0.05),
implying a  xxxg831xxx  adrenergic mechanism of action in the
venlafaxine induced antinociception. the antinociception induced by mirtazapine was significantly
inhibited by  xxxd2914xxx , yohimbine, and metergoline (p < 0.05), implying a combined serotonergic
and adrenergic mechanism of action in the mirtazapine induced antinociception (fig. 2).

venlafaxine and mirtazapine action on selected
opioid, serotonergic and adrenergic
receptor subtypes agonists
multiple doses of the selective agonist of the  xxxg831xxx 
adrenergic system (clonidine) or of the serotonergic
system (serotonin) were coadministrated with vehicle or with an inactive (subthreshold) dose of venlafaxine (2.5 mg/kg, ip) or mirtazapine (0.25 mg/kg,
ip; table 1).
when clonidine, was administered alone, a dosedependent antinociception was evident. concomitant administration of clonidine with inactive dose
of venlafaxine potentate clonidine antinociception
effects and shifted its dose-response curve almost
fivefold (p < 0.05) in to the left. ed50 value of clonidine alone was 0.5 mg/kg and with venlafaxine
0.1 mg/kg. we gave clonidine with or without an
inactive dose of mirtazapine. we did not find any
differences between the groups. the ed50 of clonidine with mirtazapine was 0.6 mg/kg, sc. we did
not see any significant shift when we gave the
nonselective 5-ht agonist serotonin with or without an inactive dose of venlafaxine or mirtazapine
(table 1).

discussion
both venlafaxine and mirtazapine were found to
induce a clear antinociceptive effect in the mouse
hotplate assay. at doses from 1 to 30 mg/kg (venlafaxine) and 1 to 7.5 mg/kg (mirtazapine), both
drugs administered ip induced antinociception in a
dose-dependent manner (fig. 1). however, although
venlafaxine’s antinociception was linear, mirtazapine’s antinociception beyond 7.5 mg/kg was found
to yield a biphasic dose-response curve, which
implies a “therapeutic window effect.” venlafaxine
and mirtazapine induced antinociceptive effects
were antagonized by naloxone (implying an involvement of the opioid system) and by the  xxxg831xxx  adrenergic
antagonist yohimbine (implying involvement of the
noradrenergic system as well). however, only mirtazapine induced nociception was blocked by the
nonselective serotonin antagonist metergoline,
implying an involvement of 5-ht mechanisms as
well. when administered together with various
opioid receptor agonists, venlafaxine significantly
potentates antinociception mediated by µ-, delta-, kappa1-,
and kappa3-opioid receptor subtypes, whereas mirtazapine significantly potentates mainly antinociception
mediated by µ-, and kappa3-opioid receptors.
since most antidepressants of the new generation
have not been found effective in the treatment of
severe depression, and the few who do exert clear
antinociceptive effects, we speculate that the involvement of the opioid system in the antidepressant
mechanism of action may be necessary, in order to
prove effective in the treatment of severe depression. among the antidepressants of the newer generations, that involvement occurs with venlafaxine
and mirtazapine, but neither with nefazodone (pick
et al., 1992) nor with the ssris fluoxetine and fluvoxamine (schreiber et al., 1996a,b), or with the
rima moclobemide (schreiber et al., 1998).
following our speculation that the opioid system
is involved in the disregulation of neurotransmitters which underly the pathophysiology of severe
depression, we successfully augmented ssri-failed
treatment of refractory depression with naltrexone
(amiaz et al., 1999). we used an opiate antagonist
in order to prevent the hazads of prolonged opiateagonists treatment (e.g., tolerance, physical dependence). naltrexone is a long acting, pure competitive
opioid antagonist principally of µ-, but also of kappa- and
delta-opioid receptors in the central nervous system,
used mainly for the treatment of alcohol and opiate
dependence (o’mara and wesley 1994; shufman et
al. 1994; o’brien et al. 1996), and for other conditions

such as binge-eating and bulimia nervosa (mitchell
et al. 1993), prader-willi syndrome (benjamin and
bout-smith 1993), and augmentation of neuroleptics in schizophrenia (rapaport et al. 1993).
interaction of the serotonergic and opioid systems
has been documented in animal models, as far as the
antinociceptive effects of various ssris are concerned (schreiber et al. 1996 a,b). furthermore, the
activity of cerebral monoaminergic systems has been
found in another animal model to be regulated to
some degree by endogenous opioid input. when that
input was chronically blocked, the basal metabolism
of monoamines in the brain was not much altered
but the system’s responsiveness to agonist challenge
was increased (ahee et al. 1990). controlled clinical
studies are needed in order to establish the efficacy
in severe depression of opiate-augmentation of antidepressants, which lack opioid interactions technique, and the optimal dosage of drugs prescribed.
