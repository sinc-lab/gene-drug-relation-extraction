expert opinion and 5-year view

background:  xxxd114xxx  (9-cis- xxxd3417xxx ) is a unique panagonist retinoid,
capable of binding to all six known retinoid receptors ( xxxg1931xxx , -beta, -gamma, and
rxr-alpha, -beta, -gamma). studies are being carried out to determine how best to utilize
this characteristic in treatments for conditions such as chronic hand
dermatitis. objective: to review the literature on  xxxd114xxx . methods: the
scope of the review encompasses ways that  xxxd114xxx  is currently and may
potentially be utilized. results/conclusions: orally administered  xxxd114xxx 
is a safe and effective treatment for chronic hand dermatitis. topical treatment with  xxxd114xxx  can be expanded into other areas such as photoaged
skin and cutaneous t-cell lymphoma. despite these benefits, oral  xxxd114xxx 
will face a difficult path attaining approval for use in the us.

background

retinoid is a term encompassing naturally occurring  xxxd3105xxx  metabolites and
their synthetic analogs. clinical studies have shown that retinoids regulate a
variety of metabolic processes that promote cell growth and function, such as cellular
differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. retinoids exert their influence by
binding to, thereby activating, specific nuclear receptors. retinoid receptors
include two groups:  xxxd3417xxx  receptors (rar) and retinoid x receptors
(rxr) [1,2]. certain retinoids exhibit greater affinity for specific receptors than
others. for example,  xxxd3417xxx  (atra) is an endogenous retinoid that
binds with high affinity for rars. it, however, has no affinity for rxrs. the
search for the natural ligand for rxr has been slightly more difficult. researchers
once thought that 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx , a metabolite of atra, may have been
the natural ligand for rxr. research has shown that 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  is present
in the developing embryo and the enzymes contributing to the synthesis of
9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  have been identified; however, 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  has not been
clearly identified in mammalian cells. therefore, it cannot be concluded that
the natural ligand for rxr is 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  [3].
both rars and rxrs can be futher divided into subcategories. rars consist
of three subgroups,  xxxg1931xxx , -beta, and -gamma. in addition, each subgroup is further
divided into isoforms, differing in their n-terminal a/b domain.  xxxg1931xxx  and
 xxxg1933xxx  each has two isoforms and  xxxg1932xxx  has four. similarly, rxrs are also
divided into three subgroups-alpha, -beta, and -gamma, with each subgroup of rxr having
two isoforms [1,2]. the predominant form of rar present in the skin is  xxxg1933xxx ,
accounting for 87% of the rar. the rest of the rar are present as  xxxg1931xxx .
rxr-alpha accounts for 90% of rxr found in the skin. rxr-beta and rxr-gamma were
not detected in a western blot assay [4]. the predominant biological role of
rars is regulation of cellular differentiation and proliferation, whereas rxrs
generally regulate cellular apoptosis [1,2].

and is therefore contraindicated for use in pregnant
women [11]. studies have shown that, above a certain
threshold,  xxxd114xxx  causes severe malformations at the
second visceral arch [12].  xxxd114xxx  has also been shown to
produce an anti-inflammatory response [13]. it inhibits the
production of  xxxd2738xxx  (no) when no production is
stimulated by either cytokines or lipopolysaccharides. it also
inhibits the production of other proinflammatory molecules
such as tnf-alpha,  xxxg1170xxx , and il-12p40. an  xxxd114xxx  gel
was approved for treatment of kaposi’s sarcoma of the skin
in 1999. the mechanism for this treatment, however, is
still unclear. current research efforts aim to expand this
treatment to other areas [10].

in cells, rxrs are able to form heterodimers with many
members of the subfamily of nuclear receptors, while rars
only form heterodimers with one of the three rxr subtypes
(alpha, beta, or gamma) [1,2]. the predominant retinoid receptor found
in the adult human skin is the  xxxg1933xxx /rxr-alpha
heterodimer [4]. when the ligand is absent, it is thought
that rar/rxr heterodimers associate with the  xxxd3417xxx 
response element, specific dna sequences found in the
promoter region of dna [1,5]. histone deacetylase is then
recruited, which deacetylates the lysine residue of the
histone tail, resulting in the repression of transcriptional
activity. upon binding of a ligand, the rar/rxr
heterodimer alters its conformation, releasing the
co-repressor complex and associates with co-activators, such
as histone acetyl transferase, which activates transcription [5].
the  xxxg2412xxx  also plays an important role in
the skin, such as hair cycling [6]. it is thought to exert its
effect through dimerization with rxr. this heterodimer
regulates transcription by binding to a specific vitamin d
response element [7].
researchers have translated this knowledge into the clinical
setting. one example is the development of tretinoin (atra)
as a treatment alternative, a naturally occurring  xxxd3105xxx 
derivative, which exerts its effect on the skin by binding
primarily to  xxxg1931xxx  [8]. tretinoin has been used in the treatment of acne and photoaging for decades [9].  xxxd114xxx 
(9-cis- xxxd3417xxx ) (table 1), a chemically similar
compound, is obtained through isomerization of tretinoin.
 xxxd114xxx  is an endogenous panagonist retinoid, binding
with high affinity to all six known retinoid receptors
( xxxg1931xxx , -beta, -gamma and rxr-alpha, -beta, -gamma), with a greater affinity
for rars than rxrs. the in vivo production of  xxxd114xxx 
is controversial because it has not been consistently detected
in mammalian cells except in the presence of tretinoin [1].
in studies,  xxxd114xxx  has been shown to inhibit cellular
proliferation and induce cellular apoptosis in certain
circumstances [10]. as a retinoid,  xxxd114xxx  is teratogenic

chronic hand dermatitis: oral treatment

a study conducted by bollag & ott in 1999 determined
that oral administration of  xxxd114xxx  was effective in the
treatment of patients with chronic hand dermatitis
(chd) [11]. dermatitis is a broad term used to describe
inflammation of the skin. very often, the term eczema is
used interchangeably with dermatitis. typically, this
condition is divided into chronic and acute dermatitis [14].
the type of chronic hand dermatitis seen in this study
included pompholyx (dyshidrotic eczema), hyperkeratotic
palmar eczema (tylotic eczema), fingertip eczema and
discoid eczema. the study included 38 patients, 30 of whom
were administered a 40 mg/day dose while the remaining
eight were administered a 20 mg/day dose. only two of
38 patients were unresponsive to the treatment, which was
determined both subjectively and objectively by the patient
and the physician, respectively. the physician’s assessment
was based on the reduction of the total lesion symptom
score (tlss) in increments of 20% (i.e., 0 – 20% = none;
21 – 40% = slight; 41 – 60% = moderate; 61 – 80% = good;
81 – 100% = very good). the physicians concluded that
55% of the patients had a very good response to the
treatment and 34% had a good response. the patient
responses were similar, with 66% reporting a very good
response and 26% having a good response. recurrence of
chd occurred in seven patients. in these seven patients, a
second regimen of  xxxd114xxx  treatment was administered,
producing the same results as the first set of treatment.
although oral  xxxd114xxx  treatment was generally well
tolerated, several side effects were noted, including transient
headaches, cheilitis, transient facial flushing and conjunctivitis.
the side effects experienced by these patients were no
different from those expected by any other retinoid. three
of the 30 patients in the 40 mg/day dose group were
switched to a 20 mg/day dose due to symptoms of flushing
and conjunctivitis. this transition resulted in the
disappearance of the aforementioned side effects, while
maintaining the successful treatment of chd [11].
in 2004, a larger study of the treatment of chd with
orally administered  xxxd114xxx  was conducted in 43 clinics

cheng, michaels & scheinfeld

in europe, enrolling 319 patients. the types of chd seen
in this study included hyperkeratotic eczema, fingertip
eczema and pompholyx. patients were split into four groups,
depending on the regimen: placebo,  xxxd114xxx  10, 20, or
40 mg/day. the results of the treatment were measured
using physician’s global assessment (pga), patient’s global
assessment (paga) and tlss. patients were considered
responders to the treatment if they showed little or no sign
of dermatitis at the end of the 12-week regimen. the pga
yielded 27%, 39%, 41%, and 53% responders to the
placebo, 10, 20, and 40 mg/day doses, respectively.
applying the cochran–armitage trend test to these results
demonstrated a dose-dependent effect (p < 0.001) for
the pga. the paga gave similar results (12%, 29%,
34%, 43%) and were shown to be significant by chi2 analysis
(p = 0.01 for 10 mg/day, p = 0.002 for 20 mg/day, and
p < 0.001 for 40 mg/day). the tlss showed a greater
percentage change in baseline score in the  xxxd114xxx -treated
groups than in the placebo (-25% in placebo versus -59%,
-52%, and -70.5% in 10, 20, and 40 mg/day doses, respectively). these results were shown to be dose-dependent when
analyzed with the jonckheere–terpstra trend test (p < 0.001).
effectiveness of previous treatments, as well as the cause
and severity of chd, did not impact these trends. the
10 mg/day and 20 mg/day doses did not produce significantly different side effects than those of the placebo,
affecting 35% of the patients in each respective group.
however, 53% of the 40 mg/day dose group experienced
various side effects including headaches, dry lips, dry mouth,
flushing, erythema, and eczema. by and large, the study
demonstrated that oral  xxxd114xxx  provides a safe and
effective means of treating chd [15].

kaposi’s sarcoma

3.1

topical treatment

kaposi’s sarcoma (ks) is a condition caused by human
herpes virus 8 (hhv-8) that presents as four clinical
types: classic, endemic, immunosuppression-associated, and
aids-related [16-19]. clinically, in the skin it has three stages:
patch, plaque, and nodular. ks will resolve as a patient with
hiv exceeds a cd4 count of 200/mm3. with the advent of
highly active antiretroviral therapy, the scourge of cutaneous
ks has abated to a great extent and thus the initial
expectation that  xxxd114xxx  would achieve wide use has
not been borne out in the 8 years since it was approved.
the basis for the approval of  xxxd114xxx  gel were
two multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind,
vehicle-controlled studies in patients with cutaneous lesions
of aids-related ks [10,20].
in study 1, a total of 268 patients were entered from
centers in the us and canada. researchers treated patients
topically three to four times a day with either  xxxd114xxx  gel
or a matching vehicle gel for a minimum of 12 weeks,
followed by an open-label phase in patients who had not yet

progressed on  xxxd114xxx  gel [10,20]. responses to  xxxd114xxx 
gel were demonstrated both in previously untreated patients
and in patients with prior systemic and/or topical ks
treatment. a total of 72 patients responded to  xxxd114xxx 
gel during the randomized or crossover portions of the study.
at a median duration of monitoring of 16 weeks, only 15%
of the 72 patients had relapsed. patients in this study
demonstrated overall satisfaction with the effects of the drug
on all treated lesions [10,20].
study 2 was conducted internationally, with a planned
enrollment of 270 patients. researchers treated ks topically
twice a day with  xxxd114xxx  gel or a matching vehicle for
12 weeks. based on ethical concerns, researchers ended the
clinical trial before its planned termination because of
positive interim results in the initial 82 patient dataset.
responses to  xxxd114xxx  gel were seen both in previously
untreated patients and in patients with prior systemic
and/or topical ks treatment [10,20].
in the clinical trials, responses were seen as early as 2 weeks;
most patients, however, required 4 – 8 weeks of treatment,
and some patients did not experience significant improvement until 14 or more weeks of treatment. the cumulative
percentage of patients who achieved a response was < 1% at
2 weeks, 10% at 4 weeks, and 28% at 8 weeks [10,20].
in both studies, responses occurred in patients with a
wide range of baseline cd4+ lymphocyte counts, including
patients with cd4+ lymphocyte counts < 50 cells/mm3 [10,20].
nearly all patients in the clinical trials took simultaneous
combination antiretroviral therapy to treat their ks.
3.2

oral treatment

clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the safety,
dose tolerance, and antitumor effects of  xxxd114xxx  in the
treatment of ks related to acquired immune deficiency
syndrome (aids). oral  xxxd114xxx  was not approved either
in the usa or europe, likely because other alternatives
existed, it has substantial side effects at higher doses, and
the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy
limited its utility.
the study that evaluated oral  xxxd114xxx  was a phase ii,
open-label clinical trial of oral doses of  xxxd114xxx  increasing
in 40-mg increments every 2 weeks from 60 mg/m2 per day
to a maximum of 140 mg/m2 per day. this work, conducted
by aboulafia et al., was built on the success of previous
studies on  xxxd114xxx  capsules. the study was conducted
in five hospital or health-maintenance organization
outpatient clinics. fifty-seven adult male patients with hiv
and biopsy-proven ks participated in the study [21].
aboulafia et al. evaluated safety by recording adverse
events, physical examination, laboratory test abnormalities,
treatment-limiting toxic effects, and reasons for early
withdrawal. response (≥ 50% improvement) was evaluated
by an overall ks response and by the area and height from
six index lesions selected at baseline. the authors found that
patients tolerated 60 and 100 mg/m2 per day, whereas most

 xxxd114xxx 

patients found 140 mg/m2 daily intolerable owing to
headache. common treatment-related adverse events included:
headache, xerosis, rash, alopecia, and hyperlipemia [21].
the patient response rate for the overall ks disease was
19% (11/57), including one patient with clinically complete
response. the response rate assessed by measuring six index
lesions during treatment was 39% (22/57). sixteen of 22
responding patients (73%) were refractory to at least
one previous anti-ks therapy. patients with cd4+ counts of
150 cells/µl or lower were as likely to respond as patients
with counts of > 150 cells/µl. the median time to response
was 8.5 weeks. the median duration of treatment was
15.1 weeks. aboulafia et al. concluded that  xxxd114xxx 
capsules possess moderate activity and provide durable
responses but substantial toxic effects at higher doses limit
its suitability as an anti-ks therapy [21]. this substantiated
the study conducted by miles et al., which concluded
that  xxxd114xxx  capsules could be a viable oral treatment for
ks if tolerance for the medication improved [22].
4.

utilization of  xxxd114xxx 

 xxxd114xxx  gel should initially be applied two times a day
to cutaneous ks lesions. the application frequency can be
gradually increased to three or four times a day according to
individual lesion tolerance [10,20]. if application-site irritation
occurs, patients can reduce the frequency of application of
 xxxd114xxx . the package insert notes that when severe irritation
manifests, application of topical  xxxd114xxx  can be discontinued
for several days until the symptoms subside [10,20].
the package insert defines the parameters for the use of
 xxxd114xxx . sufficient  xxxd114xxx  gel should be applied to cover
the patches, plaques or nodules of ks fully. the  xxxd114xxx 
gel should be allowed to dry for 3 – 5 min before covering
with clothing. because unaffected skin may become irritated,
application of the  xxxd114xxx  gel to normal skin surrounding
the lesions should be avoided. in addition,  xxxd114xxx  gel
should not be applied on or near mucosal body surfaces [10,20].
a response of ks lesions may be seen as soon as 2 weeks after
initiation of  xxxd114xxx  gel but most patients require treatment courses of longer duration. with continued application,
further benefit may be attained [10,20]. for some patients,
14 weeks of continuous treatment with  xxxd114xxx  gel was
needed to elicit a response. in clinical trials,  xxxd114xxx  gel was
applied for up to 96 weeks.  xxxd114xxx  gel can be continued
as long as the patient is deriving benefit and can be combined
with cryotherapy. occlusive dressings should not be applied
to the skin where  xxxd114xxx  gel has been applied [10,20].

of  xxxd114xxx  gel

6.

adverse effects of  xxxd114xxx  gel

the safety of  xxxd114xxx  gel has been assessed in clinical
studies of 385 patients with aids-related ks. adverse events
associated with the use of  xxxd114xxx  gel in patients with
aids-related ks occurred almost exclusively at the site of
application (table 2) [10,20]. the dermal toxicity begins as
erythema; with continued application of  xxxd114xxx  gel,
erythema may increase and edema may develop. dermal
toxicity may become treatment limiting, with intense
erythema, edema, and vesiculation. usually, however, adverse
events are mild to moderate in severity, and have led to
withdrawal from the study in only 7% of the patients.
severe local (application-site) skin adverse events occurred in
about 10% of patients in the us study compared with 0%
in the vehicle gel control. table 2 lists the adverse events
that occurred at the application site with an incidence of at
least 5% during the double-blind phase in the  xxxd114xxx 
gel-treated group and in the vehicle control group in the
two controlled studies. adverse events were reported at other
sites but generally were similar in the two groups [10,20].
7.

side effects of oral  xxxd114xxx 

the most common adverse events in patients taking
 xxxd114xxx  capsules include headache, dry skin, rash, alopecia,
exfoliative dermatitis, and hyperlipidemia. the presence of
these side effects associated with the use of oral  xxxd114xxx 
were assembled from phase i data. the safety, clinical tolerance,
and pharmacokinetics of  xxxd114xxx  were investigated by
miller and co-workers in 34 patients with advanced cancer [26,27].
the patients received once-daily oral doses in the range
5 – 230 mg/m2 for 3 – 4 weeks. the drug was generally
well tolerated, with headache as the main dose-limiting factor.
other adverse reactions observed were facial flushing, myalgia,
dyspnea, hypertriglyceridemia and hypercalcemia [28].
8. drug interactions, photosensitivity,
carcinogenesis, mutagenesis,
and impairment of fertility

retinoids such as tretinoin and  xxxd3297xxx  have been useful
in the treatment of cutaneous photoaging, thus it is
reasonable to speculate that  xxxd114xxx  would be similarly
440

useful. baumann et al. evaluated the safety and efficacy of
topical  xxxd114xxx  gel 0.1% in the treatment of photodamaged skin. the treatment was well tolerated by participants
(n = 20) and subjectively showed improvement of benign
skin lesions (e.g., seborrheic keratoses) and precancerous
lesions (e.g., actinic keratoses) [23].  xxxd114xxx  gel has been
used successfully to treat pyogenic granuloma [24].  xxxd114xxx 
gel has shown antitumor effects in the treatment of
cutaneous t-cell lymphoma ( xxxg2343xxx ). although not the
primary treatment for  xxxg2343xxx ,  xxxd114xxx  gel effectively
erodes persistent, unresponsive plaques [25].

the package insert of  xxxd114xxx  gel warns that it should
not be used concurrently with products that contain deet

repellent products, as well as with any other lipophilic
compound. animal toxicology studies showed increased
deet toxicity when deet was included as proof of the
formulation. although there was no clinical evidence in the
vehicle-controlled studies of drug interactions with systemic
antiretroviral agents, including protease inhibitors, macrolide
antibiotics, and azole antifungals, the effect of  xxxd114xxx 
gel on the steady-state concentrations of these drugs is
not known. no drug interaction data are available on
concomitant administration of  xxxd114xxx  gel and
systemic anti-ks agents [10,20].
retinoids as a class have been associated with photosensitivity. there were no reports of photosensitivity
associated with the use of  xxxd114xxx  gel in the clinical
studies. nonetheless because in vitro data indicate that
9-cis- xxxd3417xxx  may have a weak photosensitizing effect,
patients should be advised to minimize exposure of
treated areas to sunlight and sunlamps during the use
of  xxxd114xxx  gel [10,20].
long-term studies in animals to assess the carcinogenic
potential of  xxxd114xxx  have not been conducted.  xxxd114xxx 
was not mutagenic in vitro (bacterial assays, chinese
hamster ovary cell  xxxg1075xxx  mutation assay) and was not
clastogenic in vitro (chromosome aberration test in human
lymphocytes) nor in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). no
formal pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies between
 xxxd114xxx  gel and antiretroviral agents have been
conducted.  xxxd114xxx  gel is pregnancy category d [10,20].
while oral  xxxd114xxx  has yet to be rated, it will
undoubtedly be pregnancy category x.

9.

expert opinion and 5-year view

topical  xxxd114xxx  meets an unmet medical need of treating
a condition (chd) without the side-effect limitations of
topical or oral corticosteroids or the inconvenience of
phototherapy; however, in view of the controlled distribution
of isotretinoin in the usa and of the failure of oral  xxxd3297xxx 
to attain approval for the treatment of psoriasis in the usa,
both due to teratogenic concerns, it is likely that oral
 xxxd114xxx  will face a challenging road to approval. while it
has potential as a topical agent in the treatment of photoaging
and even psoriasis and acne (based on its mechanism rather
than clinical data), the pharmacoeconomics of the drug have
yet to be defined. although  xxxd114xxx  was shown to be
effective in the treatment of chd in clinical studies, it
demonstrated dose-dependent side effects (30 mg daily dose
produced more side effects than placebo). long-term study
data on its effect on bone density are lacking (as is longterm data generally), a concern with isotretinoin but not
 xxxd71xxx . the authors believe that  xxxd114xxx  will be
approved for the treatment of chd in the eu but not in
the usa in the next 5 years. complicating the predictions
are various changes in ownership involved with  xxxd114xxx .
ligand recently sold its oncology portfolio, which includes
topical  xxxd114xxx , to eisai. basilea, which owns the rights to
oral  xxxd114xxx , appears to be better equipped than ligand
to capitalize on opportunities presented by oral  xxxd114xxx .
the key issues are:
•  xxxd114xxx  is the first clinically proven oral treatment for
chronic hand dermatitis.

•  xxxd114xxx  is an effective treatment for cutaneous ks.
•  xxxd114xxx  is not a cure for cutaneous ks.
• with the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy, the
need for a treatment of cutaneous ks has decreased.
• due to dose-dependent side effects and other considerations,
oral  xxxd114xxx  has not found a place in the treatment of ks.
•  xxxd114xxx  exhibited dose-dependent side effects and
clinical effects when used in the treatment of chronic hand
dermatitis, thus a balance must be struck in its real-world
application (compared with the controlled environment
of clinical trials).
