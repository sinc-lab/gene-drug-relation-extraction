there is a need for effective medications for the treatment of
irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) (1, 2). motor and sensory abnormalities are frequently observed in ibs; thus, in our study of 122
patients, 32% of patients with ibs had abnormal colonic transit
(20.5% at 24 h and 11.5% at 48 h), 20.5% had increased sensation
to distensions, and 16.5% of ibs patients had reduced rectal
sensation (8). forty-six percent of patients with diarrhea-predominant ibs (d-ibs) had accelerated transit at 24 or 48 h.

␤3-adrenoceptors (␤3-ars) are expressed in the human
gastrointestinal tract (3, 19). ␤3-ar is a member of the family
of g-protein-coupled receptors that have been cloned from
human, mouse, and rat and are expressed in adipocytes, heart,
skeletal muscle, and smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal and
urogenital systems. ␤3-ar expression is colocalized with choline acetyl transferase in a majority of the neurons in human
colonic myenteric and submucosal plexus (12). the human
selective ␤3-ar agonist,  xxxd3222xxx , inhibits cholinergic contractions and enhances release of somatostatin with no effect
on carbachol-induced contractions in human isolated colon. a
rodent selective ␤3-ar agonist inhibits castor oil-induced diarrhea in rats (12).
␤3-ar agonist reduces the elevated tone and inhibits spontaneous contractions in the human isolated colon, but the exact site
of action is not clear. activation of ␤3-ar results in inhibition of
cholinergic contractions, and enhanced release of somatostatin
agonists of these receptors have been shown to inhibit spontaneous contractions of the human colon and relax precontracted
colonic longitudinal and circular muscle (4, 16, 22).
they also slow gastrointestinal transit in wild-type mice but
have no effect in ␤3-ar knockout mice (18). in a rat model of
diarrhea, the ␤3-ar agonist cl316243 decreased castor oilinduced fecal weight (12). on the other hand, ␤3-ar agonist
does not alter carbachol-induced contractions in human isolated colon (12).
visceral sensitivity is also controlled in part by adrenergic
modulation. the nonselective ␤-adrenergic agonist  xxxd2401xxx  leads to release of somatostatin. somatostatin is released
from enteroendocrine and neural elements in the gastrointestinal tract and is thought to act as an endogenous analgesic
substance (25). levasseur and colleagues (20) showed that a
␤3-adrenergic receptor agonist led to release of somatostatin
from rat gastric antral cells, which was blocked with an
antagonist. ␤3-ar agonist inhibited mustard oil-induced visceral pain via somatostatin receptor-2 activation (12).
given the colocalization on cholinergic neurons, it would
appear that a ␤3-adrenergic agonist might be proposed for
treatment of d-ibs. currently, loperamide and alosetron are
the main pharmacological therapies available for patients with
d-ibs (2). although loperamide is available over the counter,
alosetron is not prescribed extensively given its potential to
cause ischemic colitis.

(␤3-ar) are expressed by cholinergic myenteric neurons and ␤3-ar
agonists are effective in experimental models of diarrhea. our aim
was to explore the effects of a ␤3-ar agonist,  xxxd3222xxx , on gastrointestinal transit, safety, bowel function, plasma somatostatin, and
 xxxd3222xxx  pharmacokinetics (pk) following single and multiple
doses. in a single-center, double-blind, parallel-group trial, 36 healthy
volunteers were randomized to oral  xxxd3222xxx  (50 or 200 mg twice
daily) or placebo. transit was measured by a validated method
(99mtc-labeled egg meal and 111in charcoal delivered to the colon via
delayed-release capsule). stool frequency, form, and ease of passage
were measured on a validated daily diary; plasma somatostatin by
radioimmunoassay and plasma  xxxd3222xxx  and its active metabolite by
validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy analysis
followed by pk analysis using noncompartmental methods. there
were no overall or dose-related effects of  xxxd3222xxx  on gastric, small
bowel, or colonic transit, plasma somatostatin levels, stool frequency,
form, or ease of passage in healthy volunteers.  xxxd3222xxx  and active
metabolite exposures (area under the curve and maximum serum
concentration) at both dose levels were consistent with pk at similar
doses in previous phase i studies. we concluded that 7 days of the
␤3-ar agonist,  xxxd3222xxx , 50 or 200 mg twice daily, did not
significantly alter gastrointestinal or colonic transit or bowel function.
in this study, medication was generally well tolerated with few
adverse events reported and no clinically significant changes in vital
signs observed. further studies on clinical efficacy, visceral sensitivity, and gastrointestinal transit are required in irritable bowel syndrome patients.

␤-3 adrenergic receptor agonist on gi transit

our aims were to assess dose-related effects of  xxxd3222xxx 
on gastrointestinal and colonic transit, bowel function, and
plasma somatostatin levels in healthy human volunteers and to
characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd3222xxx  and its
active metabolite following single and multiple dosing.
methods

trial design. we performed a single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to compare gastrointestinal transit between
two different doses of  xxxd3222xxx  (50 mg twice daily, 200 mg twice daily,
n ⫽ 12 in each treatment group) and placebo (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct00401479; gsk study no. b3i106248). allocation was
concealed. normal-weight participants were recruited, without restriction for gender, race, or ethnicity through public advertisement. all
participants gave written, informed consent to participate in this study,
which was approved by the mayo clinic institutional review board.
study procedure. study participants were recruited by public advertisement and were enrolled in the study for 3 wk (including screen,
7 days of study medication, and follow-up). at the screening visit,
subjects underwent a history and physical exam, laboratory work
(chemistry, complete blood cell count, urinalysis), ecg, pregnancy
test, were given a bowel habit diary to record their baseline bowel
function using the bristol stool scale for stool consistency rating (21)
and completed the bowel disease questionnaire (26). they returned
in 7–14 days for repeat ecg, pregnancy test, return of their baseline
bowel habit diary and receipt of the treatment bowel habit diary,
receipt of study medication, and blood work (somatostatin levels). for
the next 6 days, participants took the study medication twice daily.
they returned for vital sign check on study day 2 and study day 5. on
study days 6, 7, and 8 they completed the scintigraphic gastrointestinal
transit test. blood samples were also obtained for measurement of
somatostatin and  xxxd3222xxx  on study days 1 and 6 to determine both
plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters, respectively.
seven to 14 days after the last dose of study medication, they returned
for a final visit in which blood work, ecg, physical exam, and
pregnancy test were repeated. the experimental design is summarized
in fig. 1.
 xxxd3222xxx .  xxxd3222xxx  hydrochloride is a potent and selective in vitro
agonist of human ␤3-ar activity compared with human ␤1- and ␤2-adrenergic activity and is not an antagonist at either ␤1- or ␤2-ars.  xxxd3222xxx  is
a biaryl phenethanolamine compound [(1,1⬘-biphenyl)-3-carboxylic acid,
3⬘-((2-(((2r)-2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl)amino)ethyl)amino)-,
hydrochloride] of the class described by uehling et al. (27). the
primary metabolite of  xxxd3222xxx  is the o-acyl glucuronide metabolite
 xxxd3222xxx ; it has similar activity to  xxxd3222xxx  as a selective ␤3adrenergic agonist.
 xxxd3222xxx  is a ␤3-adrenergic agonist that has been shown to
reduce nerve-stimulated colonic smooth muscle contractions and
stimulate release of somatostatin, which has analgesic properties, in
human tissues. the pharmacokinetics of both  xxxd3222xxx  (parent) and

its active metabolite have been studied extensively in both single- and
repeat-dose studies (unpublished data). both parent and active metabolite are rapidly absorbed and depict a median time of maximum
concentration (tmax) of 1.5–3 h and 3– 4 h, respectively, upon repeat
dosing. mean elimination half-life for parent compound ranges from
5 to 8 h and from 4.5 to 7.5 h for active metabolite. both  xxxd3222xxx 
and active metabolite increase in a less than dose-proportional manner
at doses ranging from 300 to 400 mg twice daily.
prior to our trial,  xxxd3222xxx  had been tested in 442 human subjects
at doses ranging from 25 mg daily to 400 mg twice a day (unpublished
data). at doses less than 200 mg per day, no clinically significant
adverse events occurred; with a dose of 400 mg administered orally
twice a day for 12 days, the most common adverse event was
headache.
assessment of stool frequency and consistency. during the study,
patients completed a daily diary to record their bowel habits and to
allow stool frequency, stool consistency, ease of passage, and sense of
incomplete evacuation diary data to be compared between the baseline
and treatment periods.
stool frequency was defined as the number of episodes of defecation recorded per day in the bowel habit diary; stool consistency was
defined by the seven-point pictorial bristol stool scale (21), which
ranges from unformed/watery to hard pellets; ease of passage was
defined by the seven-point adjectival scale, which ranges from incontinence to requiring manual disimpaction (13); and sense of incomplete evacuation was defined by a yes-or-no answer to the question
“did you feel like you completely emptied your bowels?”
clinical laboratory tests. hematology, clinical chemistry, and
urinalysis testing were performed at screen and follow-up visit or the
early termination visit; other tests only at screening were serum

childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test was conducted prior to
administration of study medication on day 1 and within 48 h prior to
exposure to any radiation.
gastrointestinal transit measurement with scintigraphy. we have
previously used the method (14) extensively and have demonstrated
the reproducibility and performance to be expected of transit measurements obtained with scintigraphy. in this technique, a methacrylate-coated, delayed-release capsule containing 0.1 mci of 111incl3
absorbed on activated charcoal particles is ingested. two hours after
ingestion of this capsule, two scrambled eggs labeled with 99mtcsulfur colloid are ingested with one slice of whole wheat bread and
one glass of skim milk. anterior and posterior gamma camera (siemens, diacam, malvern, pa) images are then obtained at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6,
24, and 48 h after radioactive meal ingestion. the primary outcome
variables include the percentage of radioisotope emptied from the
stomach at 1, 2, and 4 h, the gastric half-emptying time from linear
interpolation of the gastric residuals, the percentage of colonic filling
at 6 h, and the colonic geometric center (gc) at 4, 8, 24, and 48 h.
plasma somatostatin. serial blood samples for somatostatin were
collected prior to dosing (⫺5 min) and at 30, 60, 120, and 240 min
after administration of study drug on both day 1 and day 6. each
sample (10 ml) was collected in a chilled vacutainer (bd, franklin
lakes, nj) and centrifuged at ⫺4°c, and plasma was separated and
stored at ⫺20°c for future analysis using radioimmunoassay at a
commercial laboratory (inter science institute, inglewood, ca) using
an in-house antibody. the limit of detection of the assay is ⬍1 pg/ml,
and interassay reproducibility expressed as percent cv ranges from

9.3 to 15.7% for plasma somatostatin concentrations of 35 and 5.4
pg/ml, respectively.
pharmacokinetics. serial blood samples for  xxxd3222xxx  and its
active metabolite were collected prior to dosing and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2,
4, 6, and 8 h after administration of study drug on both day 1 and day
6. blood samples (⬃4.0 ml each) for pharmacokinetic analysis of
 xxxd3222xxx  and its primary metabolite were collected in tubes containing lithium heparin additive. samples were centrifuged in a
refrigerated centrifuge (⬃4°c) at ⬃1,500 g for 10 –15 min, and the
resulting plasma was pipetted and placed in appropriately labeled
polypropylene storage tubes [3.6 ml nunc tube (roskilde, dk-4000)].
plasma was stored immediately at ⫺20°c or below until transported
for analysis. all plasma samples were analyzed for  xxxd3222xxx  and its
primary active metabolite by the department of worldwide bioanalysis in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics of glaxosmithkline. plasma concentrations of  xxxd3222xxx  and active metabolite
were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy
(methodology on file at drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics,
glaxosmithkline pharmaceuticals). the calibration curve range for
parent compound and active metabolite was 1–1,000 ng/ml.
statistical analysis. an intent-to-treat analysis using all randomized
subjects was performed. any missing data was imputed, using the
overall mean across all subjects for each end point, with adjustment in
the degrees of freedom as needed.
primary and secondary end points (colonic gc at 8, 24, and 48 h,
gastric emptying at 2 and 4 h, colonic filling at 6 h, ascending colonic
transit time, overall stool frequency, consistency, ease of passage)
were analyzed by one-way analysis of covariance for the three
treatment groups. gender was used as a covariate in analyzing effects
of  xxxd3222xxx  on gastrointestinal transit. specific pairwise comparisons (each dose vs. placebo) were also conducted. descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum)
were calculated for somatostatin plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters for  xxxd3222xxx  and its active metabolite using
noncompartmental methods.
study power. the study was powered to detect a clinically meaningful difference in transit parameters, specifically colonic transit at
24 h and gastric emptying at 2 h; data describing stool frequency, stool
consistency, and ease of passage were assessed in a descriptive
fashion. the study had 80% power (using a two-sample z-test at a
two-sided ␣ level of 0.05) to detect effect sizes for colonic transit gc
24 and ascending colonic half time of elimination of the drug (t1/2) of
39 and 35%, respectively. the proposed study would detect changes
in transit of a magnitude that would be of clinical significance in
patients with constipation (that is, a change in gc of 1 unit) treated
with colonic prokinetics (5, 9, 23) or of similar magnitude in patients
with diarrhea given a 5-ht3 antagonist such as alosetron (28).

results

participant demographics and main results. table 1 shows
patient age and gender distributions as well as summary data.
one participant (placebo group) had missing data for only the
gc at 8 h, one subject in the 50 mg group had missing data on
all end points, and one subject in the 200 mg group had missing
data for only gc at 48 h. thus we did an imputation for, at
most, two subjects, depending on the specific end point.
effect of  xxxd3222xxx  on colonic transit. there was no effect
of treatment on overall colonic transit (fig. 2) or on ascending
colon emptying time (fig. 3).
effect of  xxxd3222xxx  on bowel function. there was no effect
of treatment on bowel function (table 1).
effect on plasma somatostatin. figure 4 summarizes the
plasma somatostatin concentrations observed at different times
on day 1 and day 6. note that there are no differences in the
plasma levels in response to the 50 or 200 mg dose of
 xxxd3222xxx .
pharmacokinetics. as depicted in table 2, following single
and repeat oral dosing of  xxxd3222xxx  at dose levels of 50 and
200 mg,  xxxd3222xxx  was rapidly absorbed with median tmax
values ranging from 1 to 3 h.  xxxd3222xxx  was also rapidly
eliminated with mean t1/2 values ranging from 1.63 to 2.33 h.
mean area under the curve over time [auc(0-t)] and maximum
concentration (cmax) values increased with the increase in dose
from 50 to 200 mg in a less than dose-proportional manner.
small to moderate between-subject variability [24 – 40% coefficient of variation (cv)] was associated with the  xxxd3222xxx 
pharmacokinetic parameters. in addition, when subjects were
administered  xxxd3222xxx  at both dose levels, the results
showed, as indicated in table 3, that the active metabolite had
a median tmax ranging from 2.96 to 4 h. like the parent
compound, the active metabolite was also rapidly eliminated
with mean t1/2 values ranging from 2.34 to 3.28 h. finally,
mean auc(0-t) and cmax values increased with the increase in
 xxxd3222xxx  dose from 50 to 200 mg in a less than doseproportional manner.

safety.  xxxd3222xxx  was generally well tolerated. twenty-two
of the 36 subjects experienced at least one adverse event. the
most common adverse events (⬎10%) reported were headache
and various gastrointestinal complaints. there was one adverse
event of headache reported as severe; all others were mild or
moderate. mean blood pressure and heart rate changes and
outlier analyses were similar across both  xxxd3222xxx  doses and
placebo. there were no clinically significant changes in clinical chemistries or hematology.
discussion

this pharmacodynamic study in healthy volunteers did not
detect a difference in the gastrointestinal or colonic transit in
response to two specific doses of  xxxd3222xxx . similarly, no
significant changes were observed for bowel function by using
descriptive analyses. the study was powered to detect a 35–
39% change in colonic transit summaries, and clearly this was
not achieved (see figs. 2 and 3) in healthy human volunteers.
this study did not detect stimulated release somatostatin in
response to two doses of  xxxd3222xxx . the pharmacokinetic
results of both  xxxd3222xxx  (parent) and active metabolite are
consistent with similar doses in previous phase i studies. given
the pharmacokinetic results of both  xxxd3222xxx  and active
metabolite, it is also apparent not only that subjects received
study drug, but that  xxxd3222xxx  exposures after both single and
twice-daily dosing achieved expected levels. these results are
informative in relation to the potential application of this
pharmacological approach in patients with ibs.
the study had a number of strengths including the design and the
validated measures of colonic transit by scintigraphy, which
have been previously demonstrated to have defined performance characteristics that were accounted for in the sample
size calculations. significant alterations in these transit measurements in response to candidate drugs also have been
predictive of efficacy (e.g., alosetron,  xxxd3097xxx ,  xxxd3302xxx ,
 xxxd3039xxx , neurotrophins,  xxxd2513xxx ,  xxxd2486xxx ) or
lack of efficacy (e.g.,  xxxd2943xxx ) in phase iib or phase iii

␤-3 adrenergic receptor agonist on gi transit

clinical trials of agents that have well-defined motor effects.
therefore, using this approach to determine whether
 xxxd3222xxx  would appreciably alter colonic transit has construct validity.
a possible explanation for the failure to show a pharmacological effect on colonic transit or bowel function is that ␤3-ar
agonists did not inhibit carbachol-induced colonic contractions
in experimental animals. in ibs patients, the postprandial
aggravation of symptoms may be driven by cholinergic input
that may not be impeded, according to the experimental studies
with carbachol. on the other hand, ␤3-ar agonists alter
colonic tone in experimental animals, suggesting that this
motor effect may alter colonic compliance, and this may
also contribute to its effects on visceral sensation. the
effects of  xxxd3222xxx  on visceral sensitivity, compliance,
tone, and phasic and tonic responses to meal ingestion in
ibs patients, as well as efficacy in phase ii and phase iii
trials are therefore eagerly awaited. this is particularly
relevant given the observations regarding the expression of
␤3-ar (12) in myenteric and submucosal neurons (including
cholinergic neurons) in mammalian and rodent intestine,
and the evidence that ␤3-ar modulation alters human colonic muscle contractility (16, 17, 22), colonic tone, and
compliance in dogs (15).
the failure to detect increases in circulating plasma somatostatin in response to  xxxd3222xxx  is not directly supportive of
the hypothesis of a somatostatin-linked visceral analgesic effect of  xxxd3222xxx . however, this result on circulating plasma
somatostatin concentrations does not discount the possibility of
a local release of somatostatin by neurons in the submucosal
and myenteric plexus or other nonneuronal cells such as
immune cells and endocrine cells in the mucosa in response to
 xxxd3222xxx  and a consequent local effect on visceral hypersensitivity.
the safety of  xxxd3222xxx , as evidenced by adverse events,
laboratory analyses, and vital signs, is similar to previous
healthy volunteer studies at similar doses.
the limitations of this study are the relatively small sample
size and the conduct of the study in healthy subjects rather than
in patients. the former is a limitation, but it was guided by a
power statement that suggests the lack of effect of  xxxd3222xxx 
on colonic transit does not represent a type ii statistical error.
the latter limitation has to be addressed by further studies in
patients.
in conclusion, at the doses tested in healthy volunteers, the
␤3-ar agonist,  xxxd3222xxx , does not significantly alter gastrointestinal or colonic transit, bowel function, or plasma somatostatin concentrations.  xxxd3222xxx  and active metabolite exposures (auc and cmax) at both 50 and 200 mg twice daily
were consistent with pharmacokinetics at similar doses in
previous phase i studies.  xxxd3222xxx  was generally well tolerated with few adverse events, and, specifically, there was no
associated bowel dysfunction. thus, although the first evaluation of the potential of modulating ␤3-ar mechanisms in
healthy human volunteers suggests there is no significant effect
on transit, further studies are required to evaluate the role of
␤3-ar modulation on colonic compliance, tone, and sensation
in humans and on symptoms in patients with irritable bowel
syndrome.
