the hi-antagonist  xxxd2572xxx : studies on performance
and visual function

summary. the effects of single oral doses of  xxxd2572xxx  (5 and 10 mg), terfenadine (60 mg) and triprolidine (10 rag) as active controls, and placebo were
evaluated on visuo-motor coordination, digit symbol
substitution, critical flicker fusion and dynamic visual acuity, and on subjective assessments of mood and
well-being in six normal female volunteers. the
study was double-blind.  xxxd2572xxx  (5mg) impaired visuo-motor coordination 7.5 h after ingestion
(considered to be a chance result), but there was no
effect on digit symbol substitution, critical flicker fusion threshold or dynamic visual acuity.  xxxd2572xxx 
(10 mg) impaired visuo-motor coordination and reduced the number of substitutions on the digit symbol substitution test. terfenadine (60 mg) had no effect on performance or on subjective feelings.
triprolidine (10 mg) impaired visuo-motor coordination, reduced the number of substitutions on the digit
symbol test, lowered the critical flicker fusion threshold and reduced dynamic visual acuity.  xxxd2572xxx 
(5 mg) and terfenadine (60 rag) are likely to prove acceptable h1 antagonists when sedation must be
avoided.

subjective feeling

antagonism, anticholinergic activity and blockade of
central alpha adrenoreceptors may also be involved,
although alpha blockade and sedation have not
correlated well for this group of drugs.
central effects are dependent on the ability of a
drug to cross the blood-brain barrier and most hiantihistamines are highly liposoluble and cross with
ease. however, it has been shown in animals that
high doses of some hi-antihistamines cause little, if
any, sedation. such compounds may cross the bloodbrain barrier only slowly and so tolerance of the central nervous system may be able to develop gradually
without immediate changes in performance, but it
has also been suggested that greater affinity for peripheral rather than central receptors could diminish
the sedative effect [23].
antihistamines which do not impair performance would be useful, and over the past few years we
have studied a number of these drugs with reference
to their effects on performance [5, 13, 14, 15, 17]. in
this context clinical studies have suggested that  xxxd2572xxx  may not lead to sedation [3, 7, 8, 11, 18],
and so in the present study we have investigated its
effects on performance.

methods

1. subjects
treatment with antihistamines is often accompanied
by impaired central nervous function, but unacceptable decrements in performance may not be an inevitable sequel of their use. drowsiness has been attributed to various mechanisms such as inhibition of
 xxxg1066xxx  [12] and blockade of
central histaminergic receptors [10, 19]. serotonergic

six healthy females with ages from 19-33 (mean 26)
years, and weights from 48-70 (mean 57) kg were
used. they had ingested antihistamines in previous
experiments, though none used these drugs clinically. alcohol was avoided within 24 h of the experiment, and they were not involved with any other
therapy except, possibly, the use of oral contraceptives. no beverages containing stimulants were taken

564
from 18.00 h on the evening preceding the day of the
experiment, and the subjects refrained from smoking
from 0.5 h before each performance session. they retired to bed at their normal times the night before,
and on the day of the experiment had a light breakfast 1 h after ingestion of tablets. transport was provided to and from the laboratory.

2. performance
several measures of performance were used which
had been found useful in previous studies with antihistamines.
visuo-motor coordination (vmc). the subjects
were required to position a spot inside a randomly
moving circle displayed on an oscilloscope, and the
movement of the spot was controlled by a hand-held
stick. subjects were trained on the task until they had
reached steady performance. each tracking run lasted 10 min, a plateau performance was reached within 100 s after the beginning of each run, and the
mean amplitude of the task over the final 500 s of
each run was the performance score [1].
digit symbol substitution (dsst). one of 100
different sheets, each with 200 randomised digits
(0-9) arranged in 10 rows was presented. under each
digit there was a space, and the subjects wrote in the
space the appropriate symbol indicated by a code at
the top of each page. this code was different for
each of the 100 sheets. at each assessment the subjects were given 2 sheeets, and 2 min to complete as
many spaces as possible for each page. the number
corrected on each sheet was scored [16].
critical flicker fusion (cff). a central flickering
field was superimposed on a concentric background.
both fields were generated by green light-emittting
diodes, and were in maxwellian view and appeared
at optical infinity. they were viewed through an artificial pupil which ensured a constant retinal illumination. fixation cross-wires kept the retinal location
of the stimulus constant.
the fields were viewed with the preferred eye,
and the flickering light was presented for 2 s. initially
the flickering light was presented at 16 hz (lower
than the possible fusion point) and the frequency
was altered stepwise according to the pattern of response. fusion was defined as the lowest frequency
at which 50% or more of the last 25 responses was
considered to be fused [16].
dynamic visual acuity (dva). acuity was measured using landolt ring targets with critical detail
ranging from 1-10rain of arc projected on to a
curved screen. the images swept from right to left at
a constant velocity of 43 or 68 ° s-1. an experimental
run consisted of eight trials of 10 target sizes at each
of the two angular velocities (160 in all). a buzzer
warned of each presentation and the subject had to

a.n. nicholsonand b.m. stone:  xxxd2572xxx  and performance
indicate within 1 s after completion of the target
sweep the position of the gap in the ring [17].

3. mood and well-being
these were assessed by visual analogue scales. the
subjects were instructed to consider the mid-point of
a 100 mm scale as their normal state. with each performance run they assessed their performance and
well-being. for performance the question and extremes of the scale were, how well did you perform?
useless - perfect. for assessments of well-being the
statements and extremes of the scale were: i am,
very wide awake - extremely sleepy, i am, very
tense - very relaxed, i am, very calm - extremely
anxious, i am, very energetic - very lethargic, i am,
very dull - very alert, i have, no ability to concentrate - complete ability to concentrate, i am, highly
efficient - completely useless.

4. experimental procedure
three drugs were studied -  xxxd2572xxx  (5 and
10 mg), and triprolidine hydrochloride in a sustained
release form (10 mg) and terfenadine (60 rag) as active controls. these are the presently recommended
single doses of triprolidine and terfenadine, though
they may not be given at the same intervals of time.
each subject received, on four separate occasions, an
active tablet and a placebo for each of the other two
drugs, and on two further occasions matching placebos for the three drugs. a random order was used
and the trial was double-blind. performance studies
within 2days of the onset of menstruation were
avoided or repeated. placebo or drug was ingested
between 08.00 and 08.30 h. performance on vmc
was measured at 0.5, 1.5, 3.5, 5.5 and 7.5 h after ingestion followed on each occasion by the remaining
tests in the order, dsst, cff and dva.

5. analysis
analysis of covariance was used to test for a pooled
linear order effect and differential linear order effects. depending on the presence of these effects a
3-factor analysis of variance or covariance was used
with treatments, times of day and subjects at 6, 5 and
6 levels respectively. the order effect was estimated
from the treatment by subject term. each of the 4
drug treatment effects (mean over time of day) was
tested against the mean of the 2 placebos using an
unmodified least significant difference. a similar
comparison was made for each drug treatment effect
at each of the 5 times of day, but the size of the test
was reduced by a fifth to allow simultaneous comparisons to be made.

in the dynamic visual acuity task there were 20
scores from 10 target sizes at 2 velocities. each score
was the number correct out of 8. a variance stabilizing transformation for binomially distributed variates (arc sine square root) was applied to the indi-

565

vidual scores which were summed to give a single
measure of dva for each of the 2 target velocities.
however, homogeneity of variance was not achieved
due to the widely varying pattern of response of the
subjects at the lower target velocity, where some
scored well in all circumstances. to overcome the
problem each subject's scores were modified by a
factor inversely proportional to his own treatment by
time of day root mean square. the scores thus transformed were analysed in the usual way. no such
problem was found at the higher velocity which was
analysed separately.
the only missing values were in the determination of flicker fusion (2 in the same subject and the
same drug, terfenadine) and they were estimated by
minimising the treatment by time of day by subject
sum of squares in the presence of the order effect.
the subjective assessments were transformed (arc
sine square root). the problem of heterogeneity of
variance remained, and the same method was used
to overcome it as was used on the low velocity dva
data.

results

results are given in tables 1-4. there were no
changes in any performance measure with terfenadine, and there were no changes in subjective assessments.
triprolidine impaired visuo-motor coordination
from 1.5-5.5 h after ingestion. it also reduced the
number of substitutions in the digit symbol test from
0.75-5.75 h, lowered the threshold at which a flickering light appeared fused from 0.85-3.85 h and reduced the mean daily score of dynamic visual acuity
at low and high velocities (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01 respectively). there were no time-related effects with
dva. the subjects considered that their performance was impaired (p < 0.01), and that they felt increased sleepiness and lethargy (p < 0.01) as well as
increased dullness (p < 0.05).
with 5 mg  xxxd2572xxx  visuo-motor coordination
was impaired  xxxd2274xxx .5 h only, but there were no changes
in this measure at other times, and there were no alterations in digit symbol substitution, critical flicker
fusion or dynamic visual acuity. examination of the
data showed that the change in visuo-motor coordination around 7.5 h was due to one subject whose
performance had been low throughout the day. with
10rag  xxxd2572xxx  visuo-motor performance was
impaired from 3.5-5.5 h and digit symbol substitutions were reduced around 5.75 h, but there were no
alterations in critical flicker fusion threshold or dynamic visual acuity. there were no changes in subjective assessments.

discussion

the present studies confirm that impaired performance is not an accompaniment of the use of terfenadine (60 mg), and that with  xxxd2572xxx  there is a
window around 5 mg which may be free of impairment of performance. changes in performance with
5 mg  xxxd2572xxx  were observed in only one test
7.5 h after ingestion, and this could have been a
chance result due to one subject. however, even
though the higher dose of  xxxd2572xxx  (10mg) which is twice the currently recommended dose impaired visuo-motor performance and performance on the digit symbol substitution test, it did not
lead to the changes in critical flicker fusion or in
dva that were observed with triprolidine.
although we have studied recommended or anticipated doses of these antihistamines it must be emphasised that they may not necessarily produce
equivalent histamine antagonism. nevertheless,
present clinical evidence suggests that 60 mg terfenadine [2, 4, 6, 9, 21] and 5 mg  xxxd2572xxx  [7, 8, 11, 22]
provide useful antihistaminic activity, and this is
likely to be free of effects on the central nervous system which lead to impairment of performance.
the mechanisms which lead to sedation or impaired performance by some but not by all antihistamines are still unclear. it is, of course, highly likely
that sedation arises from blockade of central hi-receptors [23], but as  xxxd2572xxx  possesses in some
species - including man - a greater affinity for peripheral hi-receptors than for central hi-receptors
this has been proposed as an explanation for the absence of sedative effects at doses which provide useful peripheral activity. however, absence of such
sedative properties both with  xxxd2572xxx  and terfenadine may also be due to poor or slow access to
the cerebral receptors [20].
it is evident that the appropriate use of antihistamines may lead to greater safety. in previous studies
[13] we have suggested that sustained release preparations ingested overnight may provide sufficient antiallergic effect during the next day without impaired
performance, and it would now appear that some antihistamines may be ingested during the day without
adverse effects on performance.
