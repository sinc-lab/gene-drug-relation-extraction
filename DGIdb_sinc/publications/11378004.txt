1. background and aim of the study
 xxxg2413xxx  žvegf. production leads to increased angiogenesis, which may
reduce myocardial ischemia. myocardial ischemia
could lead to ischemic heart disease žihd., which
may cause chronic heart failure žchf.. tissue ischemia has been reported in chf w1x, possibly due to
a combination of increased oxygen demand žwall
stress . and a decreased supply žcoronary vasoconstriction and endothelial dysfunction.. the use of betablockers has emerged as a beneficial treatment in
patients with chf w2᎐4x, but whether increased vegf
production may play a role in this effect is unknown.
reducing heart rate žhr. may lead to increased
myocardial vegf production w5x. therefore, we speculated that the use of beta-blockade was associated
with myocardial vegf production, which is reflected
by increases in plasma vegf w6,7x. this may cause
counteraction of tissue ischemia, which is assumed to
be beneficial in chf w8x.

2. methods
we studied patients with chf, who were clinically
stable on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition
and diuretics, with or without digoxin. all patients

had coronary artery disease žcad. and an old myocardial infarction and there were no signs of myocardial ischemia during exercise testing. left ventricular
ejection fraction was - 0.40. exclusion criteria were
previous or current beta-blocker use, use of calcium
channel blockers and amiodarone. the study was a
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, in which
patients were randomized to carvedilol or placebo žin
a 2:1 ratio.. patients were treated according to an
uptitration schedule žfinal doses ranging from 6.5 to
50 mg bid. for 3 months with the maximum dose
tolerated. all patients gave their written informed
consent. a 10-cm3 blood sample was taken at baseline
and at the end of the study to determine various
neurohormonal parameters. the blood was anticoagulated with edta and taken on ice, centrifuged for 15
min at 3000 rpm at 4⬚c and stored at y80⬚c. immunoreactive vegf was measured with an elisa
kit žr& d systems, abingdon, uk, detectable range,
5᎐115 pgrml.. plasma atrial natriuretic peptide žanp,
pmolrl., n-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide žntanp, nmolrl. and brain natriuretic peptide žbnp,
pmolrl., were measured žafter seppak extraction.
with kits from the nichols institute žnijmegen,
netherlands. and peninsula laboratories žcalifornia,
usa., as described previously w9,10x. results are given
in means " s.e.m. for comparisons between groups
an unpaired t-test for normally distributed variables
and a wilcoxon test for skewed variables were used.

not tolerating further uptitration was dizziness, no
other side-effects were observed. in table 1, it is
shown that the two treatment groups were generally
well-matched žcarvedilol, n s 12, placebo, n s 5. at
baseline žlvef, nyha class, blood pressure, etc..,
although there was a higher heart rate in the
placebo-treated group ž p- 0.01.. baseline vegf
concentrations were comparable to those previously
reported in patients with severe cad w6x. after treatment with carvedilol, natriuretic peptides, blood pressure and heart rate changed equally in patients on
carvedilol and placebo žtable 1, the differences
between alterations of clinical and neurohormonal

parameters within groups were statistically tested, results are under ‘p-value delta’.. in fig. 1 it is depicted
that plasma vegf increased to a larger extent in
patients on carvedilol ž23.2" 4.2 pgrml to 34.8" 4.4
pgrml, ps 0.06. than in patients on placebo ž29.8"
11.2 pgrml to 20.7" 9.8 pgrml, p s 0.54.. this difference between the increase in the carvedilol treated
group and the decrease in the placebo-treated group
was significant ž ps 0.02..

4. conclusions
the present findings confer an appealing concept

fig. 1. changes in plasma vegf levels in patients with carvedilol and placebo. patients on carvedilol showed an increase in plasma vegf,
while patients on placebo did not show a change in plasma vegf. the difference between groups was statistically significant ž ps 0.02..

to explain the beneficial effect of beta-blockers in
chf and ihd. since vegf is upregulated by hypoxia-sensing pathways w11x, it is not fully comprehensible why vegf is produced by a potentially antiischaemic drug. however, several effects might account for this observation. the decrease in heart rate
as is generally observed with beta-blockade causes a
prolonged diastole during which capillary diameters
are maximal. enhanced diastolic filling causes both
capillaries and myocytes to stretch, which might account for increased tissue induction of vegf w5x.
previous studies have also shown that angiogenesis
may occur, when heart rate is lowered w12x. in our
study, patients with carvedilol had a significant decrease in heart rate, however, no individual correlation between heart rate and plasma vegf levels was
found, possibly due to randomization bias that caused
a higher heart rate at baseline in patients with placebo.
carvedilol might increase vegf in concordance
with the increase of other peptides, such as observed
for natriuretic peptides in a large clinical trial w13x. in
our study, patients generally had a better neurohormonal profile after initiation with carvedilol, while
their plasma levels of anp, n-terminal anp, and
bnp tended to increase, whereas, in patients on
placebo no such trend was observed. alternatively, we
cannot exclude that ancillary properties of carvedilol,
like alpha-blockade or an anti-oxidative effect w14x,
might have played a role in the vegf production.
clearly, there are limitations that have to be acknowledged. we only investigated a small number of
patients. results should, therefore, be interpreted with
caution and results of this exploratory study should be
confirmed in larger studies. carvedilol is a combined
alpha- and beta-blocker and has also anti-oxidative
properties, so our findings may also be attributed to
other effects of carvedilol than beta-blockade alone.
we treated patients for only 3 months, so long term
effects of beta-blockade on plasma vegf levels still
have to be established. all patients suffered from
chf due to ihd, so results cannot be extrapolated to
patients with chf due to other causes.
in conclusion, we found an increase of vegf in
chf patients who used the beta-blocker carvedilol
and we speculate that at least part of the anti-ischemic
effect of beta-blockers in patients with heart disease
may be due to increased angiogenesis by production
of this pro-angiogenic cytokine.
