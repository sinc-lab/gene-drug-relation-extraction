transporters for all of these substances exist in the drosophila nervous system. in fact, in vivo uptake mechanisms have
been suggested to be responsible for 5ht accumulation in
drosophila mutants lacking the gene encoding  xxxg618xxx  (ddc) (28).
we have used a pcr-based cloning strategy to isolate a
drosophila  xxxg2150xxx  (termed dsert1) that is homologous to the mammalian monoamine transporters, as well as
to other mammalian members of the na+/cl- superfamily.
we show that dsert1 possesses a number of functional
properties of this family, including a dependence on sodium
and chloride, a high affinity for 5ht, and electrogenicity. we
also observe that dsert1 is cocaine sensitive, possessing an
unusual pharmacological profile with properties more similar
to mammalian catecholamine transporters than to indoleamine transporters, and has electrogenic properties similar to
the mammalian gaba transporteri

serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; sht) transporter cdna, denoted dsert1, was isolated and characterized in oocytes.
dsert1 shows little transport of other monoamnes and is na+

adds
ificantly to our knowledge of the diversity of 5ht
transporters with regard to pi sequence, pharmacological profile, and permeation properties.
one mechanism for the regulation of synaptic activity is
through removal of neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft
via high-affinity transporters located on neuronal and glial
plasma membranes. by slowing the removal of neurotransmitter from the cleft, inhibition of these transporters can
effectively increase the duration of neurotransmitter action
on postsynaptic receptors. recent cloning studies indicate
that neurotransmitter transporters consist of two distinct
multigene superfamilies. the members of one family are
dependent on sodium and chloride for full activity (na+/cltransporters) and their substrates include -y-aminobutyric
acid (gaba) and glycine (1-7), the monoamine neurotransmitters (8-14), proline (15), taurine (16), betaine (17), and
creatine (18). a second superfamily consists of transport
proteins that require sodium and potassium for fills activity
(na+/k+ transporters) and includes the transporters for
glutamate (19-21) and certain neutral amino acids (22, 23).
although there is no discernible sequence homology between
these two superfamilies, they do share several important
features: (i) they transport their substrates with high affinity;
(ii) their activity is dependent on membrane potential; and
(iii) they are predicted to be integral membrane proteins with
multiple transmembrane domaifs ranging from 6 to 10 for the
na+/k+ transporters to 12 for the na+/cl- transporters.
although the neurotransmitter transporters cloned to date
have all been mammalian, histochemical experiments suggest
that members of both of these gene superfamilies are present
in a variety of phyla, including crustaceans (24), nematodes
(25), and insects (26). the fruitfly drosophila is a particularly
useful model for studying neurotransmitter molecular biology, since its nervous system is well-characterized at the
anatomical, neurochemical, and genetic levels. drosophila
use gaba, acetylcholine, glutamate, dopamine, and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5ht) as neurotransmitters and
also may use such diverse substances as histamine, octopamine, and tyramine (reviewed in ref. 27). it is likely that

experimental procedures
pcr. degenerate oligonucleotide primers corresponding
to two highly conserved amino acid regions near the first
(nvwrfpy) and sixth (daatqif) transmembrane domains of the rat gaba transporter (1) were designed using
drosophila codon usage. the primers consisted of a 144-fold
degenerate upstream (sense) primer corresponding to bases
345-363 of  xxxg2143xxx  with the sequence (5' to 3') gag ctc gtc
gac aa(tc) gt(gct) tgg (ca)g(gcta) ttc cc(cag)
ta and a 48-fold degenerate downstream (antisense) primer
corresponding to bases 1008-1026 of  xxxg2143xxx  with the sequence ggg ccc tct aga aa(ga) atc tg(gc) gt(gac) gc(ga) gc(ag) tc. (the underlined portions of
these sequences indicate the addition of 5' restriction sites for
cloning purposes.) with these primers, the pcr will generate
a 683-bp product from  xxxg2143xxx  mrna and a 699-bp product
from net1 mrna. the amplification protocol consisted of
1 min at 940c, 2 min at 650c, and 2 min at 720c for 25-30
cycles. gel electrophoresis indicated a band of =700 bp,
which was subcloned into pbluescript sk(-).
isolion and characterization of dsertl cdna clone. the
700-bp product was used in a pcr to synthesize a 32p-labeled
probe. this probe was used to screen 1 x 106 phage recombinants from the drosophila head cdna library in aexlx
(29). after overnight hybridization at 420c [6x sspe (lx
sspe = 0.18 m nacl/10 mm phosphate, ph 7.4/1 mm

stringency of 500( in 2x standard saline citrate (ssc)/0.1%
sds. positive clones were rescued and the insert of one of the
three positive clones was subcloned in pgem-7zf(+)
(promega) for sequencing and in -iitro transcription.

xenopus oocyte expression and transport assays. dsert1
linearized with cla i was used as template for an in vitro
transcription reaction (ambion megascript kit, ambion,
austin, tx). to obtain expression levels large enough to
measure the transporter-associated currents, we used a previously described pcr-based procedure (30). methods for
oocyte preparation, injection, flux assays, and electrophysiology are described elsewhere (31).
northern blot analysis. twenty micrograms of total rna
from drosophila head, body, and embryo was separated on
a 1% formaldehyde agarose gel and transferred to a nylon
membrane (genescreenplus, dupont/nen) and probed
with a 506-bp fragment of dsert1 (48 bp of the c terminus
and 468 bp of 3' untranslated region). the membrane was
hybridized overnight at 420c (50%o formamide/10% dextran
sulfate/i m nacl/1% sds), washed at 650c for 15 min (0.1x
ssc/1% sds), and exposed to film for 24 h at -70'c.

results
identification of dsert1 as a  xxxg2150xxx . degenerate
oligonucleotides corresponding to conserved portions of putative transmembrane regions 1 and 7 of the na+/cl- transporter superfamily were used to amplify aliquots of a drosophila head cdna library. an expected product of =700 bp
was observed, and dna sequencing confirmed that this pcr
product encoded a member of the na+/cl- superfamily. the
insert was used to isolate a full-length cdna from the same
library. three clones were plaque purified under highstringency hybridization conditions and one (clone 39a) was
chosen for sequencing and expression characterization.
mrna synthesized from this clone was expressed in xenopus oocytes and screened for potential substrates (fig. 1).
oocytes injected with clone 39a mrna transported [3h]5ht
at 5-fold higher levels than uninjected oocytes when incubated for 30 min in 760 nm [3h]5ht. uptake of [3h]gaba,
[3h]glutamate, [3h]histamine, [3h]dopamine, and [3h]norepinephrine was not significantly over the background levels.
this indicates that clone 39a encodes a  xxxg2150xxx ,
which we have designated dsert1.
sequencing and molecular characterization of dsert1.
sequencing of dsert1 revealed a 2461-bp insert with an
open reading frame of 1743 bases. the proposed initiator
atg, at base 109, occurs within a reasonable match to the
consensus translation initiation site (32). the open reading

frame encodes a protein of 581 amino acids with a predicted
mass of 67 kda. this sequence does not contain an in-frame
stop codon or an alternative initiation codon in the 108-bp 5'
untranslated region of dsert1. it is possible that there is an
upstream initiation codon in the complete mrna and that the
present cdna encodes a functional truncated protein. hydropathy analysis (33) predicts 12 putative membranespanning domains, indicating a membrane topology similar to
that proposed for all members of the na+/cl- transporter
superfamily (1). there is one potential n-linked glycosylation
site, located in the large extracellular loop between the third
and fourth transmembrane regions. the primary amino acid
sequence predicts four potential protein kinase c phosphorylation consensus sites: two in putative extracellular regions
and two in the intracellular n terminus (thr-3 and thr-4).
comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence to those of
the mammalian 5ht transporters and to the human norepinephrine transporter reveals considerable homology (fig. 2):
52% and 53% amino acid identity to the rat and human 5ht
transporters, respectively (13, 34); 51% identity to net1 (8);
and 48% identity to the rat/bovine dopamine transporters
(9-12). the percentage identity is only 39-43% between
dsert1 and the transporters for gaba (1), glycine (5),
proline (15), and taurine (16). comparison of the dsert1
sequence to sequences in the genbank data base using the
blast program revealed no homologous sequences other
than members of the na+/cl- transporter family.
northern blot analysis. a northern blot revealed a strong
signal at -3.3 kb in total rna from adult drosophila heads,
but no detectable signal with rna from adult drosophila
bodies or embryos with an 18-h exposure (data not shown).
thus, dsert1 is predominantly expressed in structures
associated with the head, most likely neurons and/or glia of
the cephalic nervous system (35).
transport studies. oocytes injected with dsert1 mrna
exhibit an ion-dependent, high-affinity 5ht uptake system
that saturates with increasing 5ht concentration (fig. 3).
eadie-hofstee analysis (fig. 3 inset) demonstrates a km of
637 ± 100 nm (mean ± sem of four experiments), which is
similar to the km values determined for the cloned and
endogenous mammalian 5ht transporters (13, 14, 34, 36-39).
high-affinity transport of sht by dsert1 is dependent on
extracellular na+ and cl-, a hallmark of this transporter
family (40). substitution of na+ with either li+ or choline
reduced transport by -95%, while substitution of cl- with
nitrate or acetate inhibited uptake by 85-91% (data not
shown).
pharmacological specificity. drug sensitivity of dsert1
was assessed by compounds known to inhibit mammalian
biogenic amine transport (table 1). the antidepressants
fluoxetine and clomipramine were 6- to 71-fold lower in
potency at dsert1 than at the mammalian 5ht transporters.
by contrast,  xxxd2546xxx  and  xxxd2746xxx , which are strong
inhibitors of net1 and  xxxg2149xxx , but are less effective at the
mammalian  xxxg2150xxx , were potent inhibitors of
dsert1. thus, with respect to this group of antidepressants,
dsert1 has a pharmacological profile more similar to the
mammalian catecholamine transporters than to the mammalian 5ht transporters. this characteristic is further underscored by the observation that dsert1 is -5-fold more
sensitive to cocaine, a potent inhibitor of mammalian dopamine and norepinephrine uptake, than are the mammalian
5ht transporters. however, the sensitivity of dsert1 to
amphetamine is closer to that observed for the rat and human
5ht transporters than to the human norepinephrine transporter, possibly because amphetamine is a substrate for 5ht
transporters. therefore, the pharmacological profile of
dsert1 represents a mixture of those seen for the mammalian biogenic amine transporters. it is important to note,
however, that the specificity of dsert1 for 5ht as a

substrate is quite high; unlabeled 5ht is 158- to 479-fold more
potent than epinephrine, dopamine, and norepinephrine in
reducing [3h}5ht uptake by dsert1-injected oocytes. this
finding corroborates the results of uptake experiments with
labeled catecholamines (fig. 1) and further establishes that
dsert1 is indeed a  xxxg2150xxx  rather than a substrateambiguous catecholamine transporter.
we searched for additional organic substrates of dsert1

inhibitor tested in this series, reducing accumulation of
[3h]5ht to 27% ± 5% of control values (mean ± sem) at 200

decrease sht transport (105% +- 5.4%) at 200 ,um, nor did the

is an electrogenic transporter. we used two-electrode voltage-clamp analysis to characterize 5ht-induced currents.

[3h]5ht uptake. when either na+ or cl- is eliminated from
the superfusion medium, the 5ht-induced currents are too
small for systematic current-voltage analysis.

be measured (fig. 4a). at saturating concentrations of 5ht
and membrane holding potentials of -60 or -80 mv, the
largest currents induced were =300 na. the magnitude of the
5ht-induced inward currents remained essentially constant
during 5ht application times as long as 5 min (n = 11). the
5ht-induced currents were observed in dsert1-expressing
oocytes from three separate oocyte batches but were not seen
in uninjected oocytes (n = 9) or in control oocytes injected
with mrna encoding the rat brain gaba transporter  xxxg2143xxx 
(n = 6). application of 10 ,um dopamine, norepinephrine, and
epinephrine did not evoke measurable currents (data not
shown), further indicating the specificity of dsert1 for 5ht.
fig. 4b shows the current-voltage relationship for the
5ht-induced current and the effect of ion substitution on
these currents. for an oocyte superfused with 5 ,um 5ht in
nd96 medium, the 5ht-induced current increased more than
linearly between +40 and -100 mv. between -40 and -80

when expressed in xenopus oocytes, dsert1 reconstitutes
a high-affinity, cocaine-sensitive, na+- and cl--dependent
5ht uptake system. the apparent km for 5ht of dsert1
(637 nm) is comparable to the range of values determined for
the cloned mammalian 5ht transporters (13, 14, 34) as well
as for native mammalian 5ht transporters (36-39). it has a
low affinity for norepinephrine, dopamine, and epinephrine
and does not transport other neurotransmitters found in the
drosophila nervous system (e.g., glutamate, gaba, dopamine, or histamine). although the amino acid sequence of
dsert1 shows various degrees of homology with all known
members of the na+/cl- transporter superfamily, it is most
closely related to the mammalian 5ht, norepinephrine, and
dopamine transporters. the observation that dsert1 has
about the same degree of structural relatedness to the three
mammalian monoamine transporters correlates with its unusual functional properties. its sensitivity to antidepressants
more closely resembles that of net1 and  xxxg2149xxx  than that of
the mammalian  xxxg2150xxx . similarly, dsert1 is more
sensitive to cocaine than is the mammalian  xxxg2150xxx .
by contrast, the sensitivity of dsert1 to amphetamine is
more similar to that of the mammalian 5ht transporters than
to that of net1 and  xxxg2149xxx . thus, although dsert1 has a
high substrate specificity for 5ht, it exhibits a pharmacological profile that shares features of both mammalian indoleamine and catecholamine transporters.
external application of 5ht to dsert1-injected oocytes
induces an inward current that is associated with 5ht
uptake. this indicates that the transporter encoded by
dsert1 is electrogenic and that the net charge movement
associated with transport is inward. furthermore, (i) the
substrate-induced current does not inactivate, even with
extended substrate application times; (ii) the substrateinduced current has an absolute requirement for external
na+; (iii) the substrate-induced current is strongly dependent
on external cl-; (iv) the current-voltage relationship shows

greater than linear increase in inward current with membrane potential in the range of 0 to -80 mv. these electrophysiological properties - of dsert1 are similar to those

it is likely that, as in vertebrates, 5ht plays a range ofroles
in the fly, both as a classical neurotransmitter and as a
neuromodulator (35). corpbined with the repertoire of available genetic tools for drosophila, dsert1 will be an important reagent for further analysis of serotonergic neurons and
pathways, for isolation of other insect na+/cl- transporters,
and for analyzing the structural basis of transporter function.
