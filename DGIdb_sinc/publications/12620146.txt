 xxxg682xxx  as a therapeutic target in colorectal cancer.  the  xxxg682xxx  (egfr) is widely expressed in advanced colorectal cancers (crcs), and higher levels of egfr are inversely related to survival in these patients. two general strategies have been used to block egfr signaling: preventing ligand binding with anti-egfr monoclonal antibodies (eg, cetuximab and  xxxd2838xxx ) and inhibiting its intrinsic  xxxg2198xxx  with small molecules (eg, gefitinib [iressa] and  xxxd2029xxx  [osi-774,tarceva]). phase ii trials of cetuximab suggest that it might be an effective treatment option alone or in combination with standard therapies as first- or second-line therapy. phase i studies evaluating other egfr inhibitors in patients with crc have been reported. the inclusion of anti-egfr therapies into standard treatment is the subject of current clinical trials.
