abstract: the group iv pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (plp)-dependent decarboxylases belong to the beta/r barrel
structural family, and include enzymes with substrate specificity for a range of basic amino acids. a
unique homolog of this family, the paramecium bursaria chlorella virus  xxxg232xxx  (cvadc),
shares about 40% amino acid sequence identity with the eukaryotic ornithine decarboxylases (odcs).
the x-ray structure of cvadc has been solved to 1.95 and 1.8 å resolution for the free and  xxxd94xxx 
(product)-bound enzymes. the global structural differences between cvadc and eukaryotic odc are
minimal (rmsd of 1.2-1.4 å); however, the active site has significant structural rearrangements. the key
“specificity element,” is identified as the 310-helix that contains and positions substrate-binding residues
such as e296 cvadc ( xxxd332xxx  in t. brucei odc). in comparison to the odc structures, the 310-helix in
cvadc is shifted over 2 å away from the plp cofactor, thus accommodating the larger arginine substrate.
within the context of this conserved fold, the protein is designed to be flexible in the positioning and
amino acid sequence of the 310-helix, providing a mechanism to evolve different substrate preferences
within the family without large structural rearrangements. also, in the structure, the “k148-loop”
(homologous to the “k169-loop” of odc) is observed in a closed, substrate-bound conformation for the
first time. apparently the k148 loop is a mobile loop, analogous to those observed in triose phosphate
isomerase and tryptophan synthetase. in conjunction with prior structural studies these data predict that
this loop adopts different conformations throughout the catalytic cycle, and that loop movement may be
kinetically linked to the rate-limiting step of product release.

amino acid decarboxylation is an essential reaction for
the formation of many important cellular metabolites, including polyamines, amino acids, and neurotransmitters (1-3).
because of the roles these metabolites play in cellular
proliferation, enzymes catalyzing amino acid decarboxylation
have been of interest as drug targets for the prevention and
treatment of a number of proliferative diseases, such as
cancer and parasitic infections (4-7). a well-studied inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, r- xxxd2430xxx 
( xxxd1972xxx ), a suicide inhibitor of  xxxg1626xxx 
(odc), is an approved treatment for african sleeping
sickness. two distinct structural families of pyridoxal5′phosphate dependent basic amino acid decarboxylases have
been described. the group iii decarboxylases are structurally
homologous to aspartate amino transferase and the group
iv decarboxylases are homologs of alanine racemase,
assuming a beta/r barrel fold (8, 9). representatives of both
structural classes have substrate specificity for ornithine,
lysine and arginine; although, the group iv decarboxylases

have expanded substrate specificity that includes the  xxxd2537xxx  diaminopimelate (8, 9). enzymes in the group
iv family with differing specificities share low sequence
identity (i.e., < 20%) and are distantly related. a novel
exception is the paramecium bursaria chlorella virus
 xxxg232xxx  (cvadc),11 which shares 40% sequence identity with eukaryotic odcs, typical of the level
of identity shared among homologs with similar specificity
(10, 11). it is the only example of a group iv decarboxylase
with different substrate specificity found to group with the
odcs, thus providing a unique opportunity to study the
evolution of substrate specificity.
the x-ray structures of several eukaryotic odcs (1214), and bacterial diaminopimelate decarboxylases (dapdc)
have been solved (15, 16). the enzymes are obligate
homodimers and two active sites are formed at the subunit
interface between the n-terminal beta/r barrel domain, which
houses plp, and the two c-terminal beta-barrel domains.
ligand-bound trypanosoma brucei odc (tbodc) structures
have been solved with putrescine,  xxxd1972xxx  and d-ornithine

figure 1: sequence alignment of group iv decarboxylases: the alignment was produced using the dali alignment server and includes
only sequences for which structural information is available: odc from mouse, human and t. brucei, cvadc, and dapdc from m.
jannaschii, m. tuberculosis, and e. coli. the secondary structure of cvadc is illustrated above the sequences: cylinders (r-helices), arrows
(beta-strands) and lines (loops). cylinders in dashed-lines represent short, 3-residue 3 10 helices. the active site lid is shown as a red-highlighted
line between beta6 and r7 and the “specificity element” is the 310-helix r11 shown as a red-highlighted cylinder. highlighted in red in the
multiple sequence alignment are residues in the active site, which is defined as a 5 å shell around the  xxxd94xxx  product. highlighted in blue
are active site residues that are variable between the odc sequences and cvadc.

the subunit interface and each ligand makes similar contacts.
the r-amino group forms a schiff base with plp and the
delta-amino group interacts with two  xxxd233xxx  residues,
 xxxd332xxx  tbodc from the c-terminal beta-barrel domain of one
monomer and  xxxd361xxx  tbodc from the c-terminal beta-barrel
domain of the opposite monomer. the dapdc active site
is arranged similarly although the sequence identity between
odcs and dapdcs is less than 20%. based on the
methanococcus jannaschii dapdc structure, e373 mjdapdc is thought to play a similar role as  xxxd361xxx  tbodc and the
carboxylate of the bound lysine product makes contacts with
r297 dapdc (r277 tbodc) from the r/beta barrel domain.
however, overlays of the mjdapdc structure onto the
tbodc structure show numerous changes making it unclear
which are involved in specificity determination.
p. bursaria chlorella virus encodes enzymes to synthesize
homospermidine from l-arginine, one of which is cvadc
(10, 19). in previous studies this enzyme was demonstrated
to prefer l-arginine over  xxxd2793xxx  as a substrate suggesting
that it had undergone rapid evolution to change function (11).
comparison of the active sites of cvadc and odc suggested
that a relatively limited number of substitutions might
account for the specificity difference (figure 1). an obvious

difference was e296 of cvadc replaces  xxxd332xxx  of odc.
however, both t. brucei odc (d332e) and cvadc (e296d)
are inactive enzymes (11).
in order to study the structural basis of specificity and
learn more about the catalytic mechanism in the group iv
decarboxylases, the x-ray structures of cvadc in both free
and product-bound states have been determined at 1.95 and
1.8 å resolution, respectively. the overall monomeric
structure of cvadc is similar to eukaryotic odc (rmsd of
1.2-1.4 å). however, the origin of the arginine specificity
of cvadc is apparent. it arises from different positioning
of a 310-helix (residues s291-e296 cvadc) in the c-terminal
domain that includes the substrate-binding residue e296
cvadc ( xxxd332xxx  tbodc). further, a conserved loop near the
active site, residues  xxxd138xxx -v143 (k148 cvadc-loop) and
analogous to  xxxd159xxx -c164 in odc (k169 odc loop), is
observed in a closed conformation for the first time. in
comparison with human odc, where the homologous loop
adopts an open conformation (13), it appears that the loop
serves the function of a mobile lid allowing substrate access,
and sequestering substrates from solvent.

methods. cvadc expression and purification. the expression and purification of his6-tagged cvadc from
podctm9 and podctm9 t142a was described previously
(11). briefly, protein was produced heterologously in escherichia coli (bl21 de3 strain) under an inducible
promoter and purified by ni2+-agarose column chromatography followed by gel filtration column chromatography.
purified protein was concentrated via ultracentrifugation. the
t142a mutation arose during prior cloning of the gene (10),
however the two constructs produce enzymes with equivalent
activity, and they have both been used in these studies (11).
protein derived from podctm9 t142a was used for the
crystallization of free cvadc protein. site-directed mutagenesis (quickchange, stratagene, la jolla, ca) was employed
to regenerate the wild-type podctm9 plasmid. the protein
was used to crystallize cvadc bound to  xxxd94xxx .
a se-met derivative of cvadc was produced in e. coli.
an overnight culture of e. coli transfected with the podctm9
t142a was used to inoculate 1 l of m9 minimal media with
ampicillin. at log-phase growth (od600 ) 0.7), iptg (0.5
mm), 60 mg of  xxxd3187xxx , 100 mg each of threonine,
lysine, and phenylalanine, and 50 mg each of leucine,
isoleucine, and valine were added. after 13 h of induction,
cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed. purification
of the se-met derivative was performed as described above.
mass spectrometry analysis (protein chemistry technology
center, ut-southwestern med. ctr.) revealed that there were
5 se-met residues per monomer in cvadc produced from
the minimal media (data not shown).
crystallization of cvadc. approximate crystallization
conditions were found with the wizard i screen (emerald
biostructures, bainbridge island, wa). free (se- labeled)
and  xxxd94xxx -bound cvadc crystallized in similar condi-

tions. the optimized crystallization conditions are as follows: 5 µl of 20 mg/ml protein in buffer (10 mm hepes
ph 7.2, 50 mm nacl, 1 mm dtt, 0.5 mm edta ph 8.0,
0.03% (v/v) brij-35) is mixed with an equal volume of the
crystallization solution (6% peg-8000, 100 mm imidazole
(ph 7.5), 200 mm calcium acetate) and set up in sitting drops
at 16 °c.  xxxd94xxx -bound cvadc crystals were produced
by incubating 20 mg/ml protein in buffer with 5 mm
 xxxd94xxx  at 4 °c for 1 h prior to setup of the crystallization
drop. crystals generally grew within 24 h. the final
diffraction quality crystals were produced by streak-seeding
procedures. cryo-loops (hampton research) were used to
store crystals, which were cryo-protected with a solution
containing the mother liquor and 25-30% 2-methyl-2,4pentanediol (mpd) and subsequently frozen in liquid propane.
data collection and processing. diffraction data with
anomalous dispersion were collected at the se absorption
edge wavelength (lambda ) 0.98066) at beamline 19-bm (sbccat) at the advanced photon source (argonne national
laboratory, argonne, il). data for  xxxd94xxx -bound cvadc
crystals were collected at the 19-id beamline at the same
facility. the data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using
hkl2000 (20). data processing statistics are summarized
in table 1.

calculated in mlphare and density modification was
performed in dm (24, 25). with the ncs operators and
phases, a density-modified map was calculated. an initial
model, containing 2300 of 2900 expected residues in the
asymmetric unit, was built using the automated modelbuilding program arp/warp (26). the  xxxd94xxx -bound
cvadc structure was determined by using the free structure
as the initial phasing model for molecular replacement with
the cns package (27). both structures were rebuilt with the
graphics program coot (28) and the refinement package
refmac5 (29, 30). for the  xxxd94xxx -bound structure, the
fourier difference map (fo - fc) showed readily interpretable density for the  xxxd94xxx  product bound to the plp
cofactor. the  xxxd94xxx  product was modeled into the
structure and further refined. ncs restraints were released
in the final rounds of refinement and waters were added as
difference fourier peaks above 3.0sigma for both structures.
the free structure of cvadc was refined with data to 1.95
å and the  xxxd94xxx -bound structure included data to 1.8 å.
the final models contain eight monomers in the asymmetric
unit (labeled a - h), in the form of two tetramers, containing
a total of 2901 residues and eight plp molecules (or eight
plp- xxxd94xxx  complexes). dimer pairs are formed by chains
a and b, c and d, e and f, and g and h. the density for
the majority of residues and the plp cofactors was easily
interpretable. residues omitted from the molecular structure
of free-cvadc are as follows: chain a, 229; chain c, 222225, 229; chain d, 13-15, 223-224, 227, 229, 245-246;
chain e, 14, 229; chain f, 222-223, 310; chain g, 10-11,
13-14, 143, 221-225; chain h, 222-224, 229, 311.
residues omitted from cvadc- xxxd94xxx  are as follows:
chain a, 223-225; chain b, 14, 223, 311; chain c, 14, 222224, 229; chain d, 223; chain e, 14, 223; chain f, 14, 222223, 229; chain g, 14, 229, 239, 245; chain h, 10-14, 222-

223, 229. the final refined models contained no peptide
torsion angles in disallowed regions of the ramachandran
plot, and 90% of non-glycine and non-proline residues were
within the most favored regions of the plot, as confirmed
by procheck (31). the four dimers of the  xxxd94xxx -bound
cvadc overlay with an rmsd of 0.2 å, although there were
small differences in interpretable density. the a/b dimer is
the best representative, and will be described below.
molecular modeling. structures were displayed using the
graphics program pymol (40). all rmsd calculations were
based on structural alignment by pymol and calculated within
the program. the solvent accessible surface was calculated
using areaimol (29).
results
x-ray structure determination of free and agmatinebound cvadc. the overall structures of cvadc in both free
and  xxxd94xxx -bound states are similar to the previously
determined eukaryotic odc structures. the cvadc structure
consists of an n-terminal beta/r-barrel from residues 23-261
and a c-terminal beta-barrel from residues 262-372 (figure
2). in addition, a short r-helix (residues 2-11) and beta-strand
(residues 18-22) are observed at the n-terminus of both the
native and  xxxd94xxx -bound structures. the n-terminal beta-strand
is part of an extended beta-sheet forming interactions with two
strands from the c-terminal domain. the n-terminal region
of this structure has been observed in a number of other odc
structures and forms approximately the same secondary
elements observed in the cvadc structure (12, 13, 17, 18).
as with all other members of this fold-type, two identical
active sites are formed at the dimer interface (figure 2a).
residues from the beta/r barrel and beta-barrel of one monomer
as well as the beta-barrel from the opposite monomer contribute

figure 3: electron density maps of the active sites of free and ligand-bound cvadc: (a) electron density map of the carbinolamine
intermediate observed in the free cvadc structure. the intermediate is formed between the nz atom of k48, the c4′ of plp and a
hydroxyl group. (b) electron density observed in the active site of the  xxxd94xxx  (agm)-bound cvadc structure. residues that form
h-bond contacts (n292, e296,  xxxd325xxx ′, y287′) and van der waals packing (l145, y353) with the  xxxd94xxx  molecule are shown. maps (2fo
- fc) are contoured at 1.0sigma. the plp molecule and  xxxd94xxx  are colored yellow, while protein residues are colored purple (chain a) or
gray (chain b).

to the formation of the active sites. the loop consisting of
residues 135-152 is observed in a down conformation and
appears to function as an active site lid (figure 2b). two
residues in the loop, cvadc v143 and l145 are within about
5 å of the bound  xxxd94xxx  ligand.
the active site of cvadc. the electron density maps of
the active site showed good, interpretable density for both
the native and  xxxd94xxx -bound structures (table 1 and figure
3). in the native structure the plp cofactor forms an
interaction with k48 cvadc (k69 odc). this residue forms
a schiff’s base with plp and has been demonstrated to be a
key catalytic residue accelerating the rates of schiff base
formation with substrate and decarboxylation in tbodc (32).
however, unlike previous ligand-free odc structures (1214), plp is not bound to k48 cvadc through a schiff’s
base. instead the density around the c4′ of the cofactor
suggests a tetrahedral configuration consistent with a carbinolamine species (figure 3a). the model for the native enzyme
was built with a carbinolamine intermediate in all eight active
sites of the asymmetric unit and no residual density was
found in the recalculated difference fourier map. density
for the sulfhydryl group of the active site cysteine residue
c324 cvadc (c360 in eukaryotic odc), which had been
proposed to function as a general base in the reaction (18),
indicates that the cysteine side-chain exists in dual conformations within each of the eight active sites in both the native
and  xxxd94xxx -bound structures. thus, we modeled c324
cvadc as dual conformations with the sulfhydryls positioned

145° apart. the homologous residue in odcs has been
observed to occupy both of these conformations (12-14, 17,
18, 33).
in the active site of the  xxxd94xxx -bound structure good
density was observed for the  xxxd94xxx  in all four dimers in
the asymmetric unit (figure 3b). the side-chain of residue
k48 cvadc has shifted 5 å away from the cofactor to form
an interaction with  xxxd67xxx  cvadc, thus making room for the
bound product (figure 4). the electron density is consistent
with a schiff’s base structure between n1 of  xxxd94xxx  and
c4′of plp. the aliphatic portion of  xxxd94xxx  packs against
y353, f361 and v143, while the guanidinium moiety is
within h-bonding distance of the side-chains of e296, n292,
 xxxd325xxx , and y287.
the k148 cvadc (k169 odc) loop functions as an active
site lid. to investigate the structural differences between free
cvadc and eukaryotic odc, the cr atoms of the n-terminal
beta/r-barrel domain of cvadc (residues 23-261), t. brucei
odc (1qu4, residues 43-283), and human odc (1d7k,
residues 45-283) were aligned. the overall rmsd between
all three structures at the level of the monomer was small
ranging from 1.2 (tbodc) to 1.4 (hodc) å (figure 5 and
6). however, regions of the structure displayed rmsd values
above 2.5 å. notably significant changes are observed in
the k148 cvadc (k169 odc) loop which is formed by
residues 135 - 152 cvadc at the end of the beta6-strand
(figure 5). with the exception of the human odc structure

figure 4: stereopair of the structure of the ligand-bound active site of cvadc. the 5 å shell of residues surrounding the plp- xxxd94xxx 
complex is shown in stick representation. the cofactor-product complex is shown in yellow and residues are shown in purple (chain a) or
light purple (chain b).

(13), portions of this loop (residues  xxxd158xxx -r165 odc) have
typically been disordered in the eukaryotic odc structures
that have been solved (e.g., the mouse odc and the t. brucei
odc structures (12, 14, 17, 18, 33)). density for the entire
loop was observed in the human odc structure where it
assumes an open, solvent accessible, conformation that points
away from the actives site (figure 5). in contrast, in both
the native and  xxxd94xxx -bound structures of cvadc the loop
has swung 9 å toward the active site, pivoting around
residues p139 and n147, and it is observed for the first time
in a closed conformation. in this conformation, the bound
ligands are sequestered from solvent (figure 2b and 5). in
the  xxxd94xxx -bound cvadc structure there is no solventaccessible surface on  xxxd94xxx , while 2.0 å2 is accessible
on the adjacent plp molecule. in contrast, the putrescine
molecule in the ligand-bound tbodc structure has 21 å2 of
solvent exposed surface compared to 1.3 å2 for its plp
molecule. both conformations of the loop are likely to be
available to both enzymes, since there appears to be no route
for substrate entry in cvadc. thus, these data suggest that
this loop functions as a mobile active site lid in this family
of enzymes, controlling access to the substrate binding site
during the catalytic cycle. in addition to this change the cr
atoms of residues s179-n183 cvadc, which cover the
phosphate of plp, have shifted 3 å toward the phosphate
moiety in cvadc. this movement allows the formation of
a new h-bond interaction between the backbone of s179
and v143 in cvadc (figure 4). additional backbone h-bond
interactions between residues  xxxg178xxx - xxxg180xxx  and t142-v143
cvadc seem to promote the shift of the s179-n183 cvadc
region and add to the stabilization of the k148 cvadc loop.
the 310-helix is a key determinant of substrate specificity.
in order to delineate the determinants of substrate specificity in cvadc,  xxxd94xxx -bound cvadc and putrescine-bound
tbodc (1f3t) were compared (figure 6). the subunits
aligned by their n-terminal beta/r barrel domains overlaid with
an rmsd of 1.2 å for the monomers. very little or no domain
rotation is observed. residues at the bottom of the pocket

that interact with the plp cofactor superimpose precisely
between the two structures, including the positions of  xxxd67xxx ,
k48, and e252-r255 in cvadc. the beta-barrel c-terminal
domains of the opposite subunit are also closely aligned,
including the catalytic base and substrate recognition residues, c324′ and  xxxd325xxx ′ cvadc. part of the c-terminal
beta-barrels of the primary subunits of cvadc and tbodc also
superimpose well, including the substrate binding residues
y287, y353, and f360 of cvadc. however, significant
differences in the structures are apparent, providing new
insight into the structural basis of specificity in this family
of enzymes. in both the cvadc and odc structures residues
s291-e296 cvadc (s325- xxxd332xxx  odc) form a short 310helix at the distal portion of the substrate-binding pocket.
the helix in the tbodc structure begins 2 residues prior to
that observed in cvadc, however, the helix ends at the same
position (e296/ xxxd332xxx ) in both (figure 1). this residue, e296
cvadc ( xxxd332xxx  odc) is positioned from the helix to form
hydrogen bond contacts with the guanidinium of  xxxd94xxx 
in cvadc (the delta-amino of putrescine in odc). in the cvadc
structure the helix is translated 2.1 å away from the cofactor
when compared to tbodc (as measured between c4′ of plp
and the cr of e296/ xxxd332xxx ), effectively enlarging the pocket
to accommodate the arginine substrate (figure 6). the
shortening of the helix may contribute to this shift. however
despite this translation the longer aliphatic portion of e296
cvadc accommodates this more distal position of the helix
without changing the final position of the carboxylate portion
of the side chain, which remains similarly placed to that of
 xxxd332xxx  odc. thus e296 cvadc is able to retain key contacts
with the remainder of the active site, including a h-bond
interaction with r255 cvadc (r277 odc). this residue
forms interactions with the phosphate moiety of plp, thus
its precise positioning in the active site is necessary for the
function of the enzyme.
in addition to the repositioning of the 310-helix the
structural alignment identifies several other amino acid
substitutions in the distal region of the active site that may

n-terminal residues of cvadc (residues 23-261) and human odc

structures is 1.4 å as calculated for the monomer. the secondary

contribute to the specificity change (table 2). the more
noteworthy substitutions in the region include  xxxd404xxx  odc
(n292 cvadc) and  xxxg393xxx  tbodc (l357 cvadc). the sidechain of  xxxd404xxx  odc is turned out of the active site and forms
an h-bond interaction with the backbone carbonyl of s325.
in contrast, the side-chain of n292 cvadc is pointed toward
the active side and the carbonyl oxygen forms a h-bond with
the guanidinium moiety of  xxxd94xxx  (3.3 å). l357′ cvadc
(contributed to the active site from the opposite subunit) does
not form a direct interaction with the  xxxd94xxx  ligand
(distance 5.67 å), however the increased bulk of the side
chain in comparison to odc (gly or ala at this position),
may play a role in positioning of the 310-helix. the sidechain of l357′ is within van der waals contact of the sidechain of s291 cvadc of the 310-helix. this contact may
help stabilize the position of the 310-helix in order to maintain
the proper volume of the active site to accommodate arginine.
structural comparison of cvadc and dapdcs. to further
probe the structural basis of substrate specificity the active
site of cvadc was compared to the three available structures
of dapdc. the n-terminal beta/r barrel domain of cvadc
with mycobacterium tuberculosis dapdc (residues 48-305,
1hkv), e. coli dapdc (residues 33-271, 1ko0) and m.

biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 10, 2007 2837
jannaschii dapdc (residues 51-312, 1twi) were superimposed, and the rmsd for the monomer ranged from 2.3 to
2.5 å (figure 7). the significantly greater divergence in the
structures is consistent with the fact that dapdc and cvadc
share less than 20% sequence identity. the differences
between cvadc and the dapdc structures arise from
differences distributed throughout both the n- and c-terminal
domains. unlike for the comparison to alanine racemase (14)
no apparent domain rotation has taken place between
dapdc and cvadc. despite the higher rmsd values for
the overall structures, the active site of dapdc is similar
to cvadc (or odc). as with the cvadc and tbodc
comparison, the position of the 310-helix is substantially
different between cvadc and the dapdc structures, and
indeed it assumes a different conformation in all three
structures. the distance between c4′of plp and the helix
(cr of  xxxd332xxx  tbodc, e296 cvadc and e348 mjdapdc)
is 10.0 å for tbodc, 12.1 å for cvadc, 15.3 å for
mjdapdc.
additionally amino acid substitutions in the helix provide
a diversity of interactions for the various substrates that are
accommodated in the different structures. the key interactions with ligand for odc and cvadc include one common
interaction  xxxd332xxx  tbodc (e296 cvadc), while  xxxd94xxx  in
cvadc makes an additional interaction with n292 cvadc
positioned at the start of the 310-helix. for dapdc the
residue at the start of the helix has been substituted with
r343 mjdapdc, which forms a salt bridge with the
carboxylate of the bound lysine. additionally the hydroxyl
group of y347 mjdapdc forms h-bond interactions with
the amine group of lysine, while the residue equivalent to
 xxxd332xxx  tbodc faces out of the pocket. these data support
the conclusion that the 310-helix is a major determinant
defining substrate specificity in the beta/r-barrel fold decarboxylase family. within the context of this conserved fold,
the protein is designed to be flexible in the positioning and
amino acid sequence of the 310-helix, providing a mechanism
to evolve different substrate preferences without large
structural changes.
discussion
the beta/r-fold type decarboxylases are composed of a large,
diverse family with a broad range of substrate preferences
for basic amino acids (8, 9). the discovery of cvadc, an
 xxxg232xxx  closely related to the eukaryotic
odcs, provided a unique opportunity to gain insight into
the evolution of enzyme specificity in this family (11). the
structure of cvadc identifies the e296 cvadc ( xxxd332xxx  odc)
310-helix as the key determinant of substrate specificity.
comparison of cvadc with both eukaryotic odc and
bacterial dapdc structures shows that the 310-helix assumes
a different orientation in each structure (figures 5-7).
previous structures of odc and dapdc had demonstrated
that residues within this helix formed key interactions with
substrate analogs bound to the active sites of these enzymes,
and suggested that the distance between these residues and
the plp cofactor served as a molecular ruler guiding substrate
preference (14-16). however given the divergence of these
two structures the importance of the position of the helix
was unclear. in contrast the cvadc and odc structures are
very similar. most of the active site, including the catalytic
residues, and those that interact with plp superimpose

exactly, thus the repositioning of the 310-helix within this
context provides a clear correlation between the helix
conformation and the altered substrate preference.
flexibility in the position of the 310-helix provides a
mechanism to adjust the volume in the pocket to accommodate different substrates, however changes in amino acid
composition are required to build the differently structured
active sites (table 2 and figure 1). in cvadc e296 has
replaced  xxxd332xxx  odc, and the longer side chain arm allows
the helix to be positioned further back into the pocket, while
still placing the carboxylate portion of e296 in the same
position as  xxxd332xxx  odc. this allows contact with the
guanidinium portion of the arginine substrate, while impor-

tantly preserving a salt bridge with r255 cvadc (r277
odc). this interaction is likely to be important for orienting
this residue, which was previously shown in tbodc to be
essential for high affinity plp binding through interaction
with the phosphate (34). the structure also explains why
the d332e tbodc and e296d cvadc mutants were inactive
(11). this single point mutation is not sufficient to encode
the repositioning of the 310-helix, nor the required substrate
interactions. in addition to the amino acid change at this
position,  xxxd404xxx  tbodc is replaced by n292 cvadc. the side
chain of this residue is reoriented toward the active site and
makes a hydrogen bond with the bound  xxxd94xxx , suggesting
that this interaction is also an important component of the
reorganization of the pocket to recognize the arginine
substrate. additionally, the structure of cvadc suggests two
mechanisms that may contribute to differences in the
positioning of the helix. first the length of the helix differs
between homologs in the family. second, substitutions of
second shell residues that interact with the helix may also
contribute to the different conformations. l357′ cvadc
packs against the side chain of s291 cvadc in the 310-helix.
this contrasts with odc where either ala or gly-393 are
found at this position and form an interaction with the sidechain of n327 odc in the 310-helix. thus the sequence of
the 310-helix clearly coevolves multiple changes that play a

role in the final orientation and chemistry of the helix in the
structure.
the substrate preference for dapdc can also be understood in the context of changes in the amino acid composition
of the 310-helix. accommodation of the dicarboxylate
substrate diaminopimelate requires the pocket to accommodate interactions with a carboxylate on the ligand as well
as the amino group. r343 mjdapdc is positioned in the
active site of dapdc and forms interactions with the
carboxylate of azelic acid ( xxxd269xxx ) or lysine (1twi) bound
in the structure. this position is a neutral residue in the odc
and cvadc structures, and the side chain points away from
the active site in both. thus this interaction in the dapdc
structure, which was not previously recognized (15, 16), is
likely to play an important role in substrate recognition.
likewise residue y347 mjdapdc is positioned differently
than the equivalent residue in odc, and interacts with the
-amino group of ligand. y331 odc is not oriented into
the active site but instead is at the 2-fold axis of the dimer
interface. thus, evolutionary changes that alter both the
position of the helix, and its amino acid sequence composition, provide the flexibility to accommodate different substrates into this structural fold.
finally, the finding that the active site is sequestered by a
mobile-loop (k148 cvadc-loop) in the cvadc structure has
provided novel insight into the reaction mechanism of the
beta/r fold-type decarboxylases. kinetic and structural studies
of mutations introduced at residues in the dimer interface of
tbodc previously suggested that dynamic motion of the

analogous loop (k169 tbodc loop) played a role in the
catalytic cycle (33). however, multiple conformations of the
loop have never previously been observed in a structure.
indeed the k169 odc loop is disordered in all odc
structures except that of human odc, where the loop was
observed in an open conformation, distant from the active
site (figure 5). in contrast for the cvadc structure the k148
cvadc (k169 odc) loop is observed in the down or closed
conformation, positioned as a lid over the active site. in this
conformation it makes contacts with key active site residues
(e.g., s179 cvadc), and it effectively sequesters the active
site from solvent. the conformation of a second active site
loop formed by s179-n183 cvadc is also repositioned in
the closed conformation structure, shortening the h-bond
distance between s179 and the phosphate of plp.
the sequestering of the substrate from solvent in the “lid
down” conformation implies that the loop must be in the
open position for substrate to access the active site and for
product to be released. previous investigations have demonstrated that product release is the rate-limiting step in
tbodc catalysis (35), suggesting that the rate of lid movement may in fact be the rate-limiting step. additionally, the
ligand-free cvadc reveals a tetrahedral carbinolamine adduct
between the c4′ of plp and k48 cvadc, rather than a
schiff’s base. although the carbinolamine has been observed
in mutant odc structures, it was unclear if this species could
form in the wild-type enzyme (33). the observation of the
carbinolamine intermediate in cvadc suggests that the
closed or loop down conformation may promote formation

2840 biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 10, 2007
of the tetrahedral structure, perhaps because it mimics
transition state structures along the reaction coordinate. in
support of a catalytic role for the loop, mutation of k169
tbodc significantly reduces the catalytic efficiency of the
enzyme (36).
the data taken together suggest that both closed and open
conformations are used in all group iv decarboxylases to
accommodate sequestering of the substrate from solvent,
substrate entry, and product release. dynamic loops have
previously been reported for enzymes in this r/beta fold (e.g.,
 xxxg2316xxx  (tim) and tryptophan synthase
(ts),  xxxd557xxx  dehydrogenase (impdh))
(37-39). it is interesting that the mobile loop in cvadc
occupies the same position in the tim barrel as those
observed in tim and ts. thus, apparently a mobile loop
that controls substrate access appears to be a conserved
structural feature of the beta/r barrel fold-type enzymes.
