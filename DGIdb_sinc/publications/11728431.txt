abstract
using neurochemical method, evidence was obtained that cannabinoid cb1 receptors are localized on noradrenergic terminals and
their stimulation by win-55,212-2 reduces the release of w3 hxnoradrenaline evoked by axonal activity in a frequency-dependent manner.
at stimulation rates of 1 and 3 hz, there was significant inhibition of noradrenaline release, with ic 50 of win-55,212-2 41.5 " 2.6 and
320.5 " 28.2 nm, for 1 and 3 hz, respectively. cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx  antagonist sr 141716a completely prevented win-55,212-2
from reducing the release. the release of noradrenaline is negatively modulated by presynaptic a 2-adrenoceptors. because brl-44408,
an a 2b-adrenoceptor, and  xxxd3000xxx , an a 1- and a 2b-adrenoceptor antagonist, both increased the release of w3 hxnoradrenaline, it seems
likely that the a 2b subtype is responsible for the negative feedback modulation of noradrenaline release. in the presence of
a 2-adrenoceptor antagonism, cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx  activation by win-55,212-2 was much more effective in inhibiting the release of
w3 hxnoradrenaline. using a specific antibody against the c-terminus of the rat cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx  and also against  xxxg1590xxx ,
ultrastructural evidence was obtained that cannabinoid cb1 receptors are exclusively localized on  xxxg1590xxx -positive noradrenergic
varicosities.
since the sympathetic innervation of the human airway smooth muscle is sparse, and mainly the circulating adrenaline relaxes the
airways via activation of b 2-adrenoceptor localized on the smooth muscle, it is suggested that inhibition of noradrenaline release by
cannabinoids, and the subsequent bronchospasm, may be limited to those cases when noradrenaline released from sympathetic varicosities
is involved in airway relaxation. q 2001 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
marijuana, the common name of cannabis satiõa, and
its psychoactive ingredient, žy.-d9-tetrahydrocannabinol,
both influence the central žcns. and peripheral nervous
systems. besides its pharmacological effects in the cns
žanti-emesis, analgesia, anticonvulsive action, etc.., it inhibits the release of some neurotransmitters žrinaldicarmona et al., 1994; pertwee et al., 1995, 1996; schlicker
et al., 1997; coutts and pertwee, 1997; gobel
¨ et al., 2000;
kim and thayer, 2000; szabo´ et al., 2000; katona et al.,
1999, 2000.. recently it was shown žcalignano et al.,
2000. that the endocannabinoid anandamide exerts dual
effects on bronchial responsiveness in guinea pigs: it inhibits capsaicin-induced bronchospasm and cough, but pro-

duces bronchospasms when the effect of vagal tone is
removed. both actions are mediated via cannabinoid cb1
receptors. because evidence was obtained that anandamide
is locally generated in guinea pig lung, it was suggested
that endocannabinoids are involved in the intrinsic control
of bronchial responsiveness žcalignano et al., 2000.. it is
known that sympathetic axon terminals are equipped with
inhibitory a 2-adrenoceptors. therefore, the effects of
cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx  activation on noradrenaline release were studied in the presence and absence of a 2adrenoceptor-mediated negative feedback control of noradrenaline release.

2.1. [ h]noradrenaline release
w3 hxnoradrenaline release experiments were performed
as described previously žsumiya et al., 2001; taoda et al.,
2001.. tissues were cut into small pieces, washed with 5
ml of krebs, and loaded for 45 min with w3 hxnoradrenaline
žl-7.8-w3 hxnoradrenaline, 37 mbq, 40 cirmmoly1 , amersham. at a concentration of 10 mci mly1 of krebs solution. during the entire experiment, the medium was bubbled with a mixture of 95% oxygen–5% carbon dioxide.
after incubation, the slices were washed with 5 ml of
krebs solution and transferred into a four-channel microvolume perfusion system žvizi et al., 1985.. three pieces
were placed into each chamber and the preparation was
superfused with krebs solution at 37 8c at a rate of 0.6 ml
miny1 for 60 min žpre-perfusion period., and the effluent
was discarded. subsequently, 3-min fractions were collected. during the sample collection period, electrical field
stimulation was applied twice, 30 min apart žs 1 , s 2 ., using
a grass 88 stimulator. the parameters of electrical field
stimulations applied during the 3rd žs1 . and 13th žs 2 .
fractions were 25 v; 3 ms; 1, 3 and 10 hz; for 180, 60,
and 18 s ž180 pulses.. preliminary experiments confirmed
that the stimulation-evoked release of w3 hxnoradrenaline is
sensitive to the sodium channel inhibitor tetrodotoxin ž1
mm. using this stimulation paradigm. the effects of drugs
on the basal efflux and stimulation-evoked release of
w3 hxnoradrenaline were evaluated by comparing the basal
or stimulation-evoked release žs 2 . obtained in the presence
of drugs to the basal efflux or stimulation-evoked overflow
žs 1 . assayed in the absence of drugs. data were expressed
as absolute amount of radioactivity in bqrg ždisintegration
per second per gram of tissue. or as fractional release
žfr.. fractional release žfr. is expressed as a percentage
of the total stored radioactivity in the tissue. the effects of
drugs were expressed as frs 2rfrs1 ratios, measured in
the absence and presence of the drug. the release in
response to stimulation was estimated by the area-underthe-curve method using a computer program. drugs were
added from the eighth fraction, 15 min before the second
stimulation, until the end of the experiment. at the end of
the experiment, the pieces were removed from the chamber
and homogenized in 0.5 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. a
0.5-ml aliquot of the superfusate and 0.1 ml of the tissue
supernatant were added to 2 ml of scintillation cocktail
žultima gold packard.. tritium was measured with a
packard 1900 tr liquid scintillation counter using an
internal standard.

where cr is the concentration ratio derived from the
agonist ec 50 values in the presence and absence of a
concentration of antagonist ž b ., resulting in rightward
shift of the concentration–response curve, with a minimum
reduction of the emax . the analysis assumes that at this
concentration of antagonist, there is a competitive interaction with a slope of 1.
2.2. immunocytochemistry
three guinea pigs were perfused through the right
ventricle with a phosphate-buffered ž0.1 m. fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% picric acid and 0.1%
glutaraldehyde. the lungs were cut into blocks and were
further postfixed for 12 h. eighty-micrometer-thick lung
sections were cut on a vibratome. immunostainings were
carried out in a manner as described previously for brain
sections žkatona et al., 1999.. briefly, the lung sections
were washed extensively and then incubated for 48 h in a
rabbit primary antibody generated against the c-terminus
of the rat cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx , at a dilution of
1:5000. the staining pattern and intensity was similar
between the rat and guinea pig hippocampus, indicating
that this antibody recognizes the  xxxg479xxx  protein in
the guinea pig tissue with the same efficacy as in rats. this
was expected in light of the very high homology in the
amino acid sequence of  xxxg479xxx  among several mammalian species. the specificity of the antibody has been
confirmed by the lack of staining in cannabinoid cb1
receptor knockout mice žhajos
´ et al., 2000.. after incubation, the sections were washed several times, then incubated again for 6 h in a secondary antibody conjugated to
1-nm-thick gold particles. the size of the gold particles
had been increased further by silver intensification. for the
second immunostaining, the sections were incubated in a
primary antibody against  xxxg1590xxx  ž1:20,000,
csiffary
´ et al., 1990. and then developed by using the
conventional abc method.
for electron microscopy, bronchi and bronchioli containing several  xxxg1590xxx -positive axons were selected using the light microscope and re-embedded into
durcupan. ultrathin sections were cut by a reichert ultramicrotome. in the electron microscope, neuropeptide yimmunoreactive axons were followed through serial sections and the individual silver–gold particles attached to
the inner surface of the plasma membrane were counted to
determine the cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx -positivity of a
given fiber.

3. results
after loading of the tissue with w3 hxnoradrenaline, the
total tissue w3 hx content was 740 157 " 49 562 bqrg ž n s
24.. using hplc combined with a radioactivity assay, of
the total radioactivity, 94.5 " 5.7% ž n s 4. was found to
be w3 hxnoradrenaline. this indicates that w3 hxnoradrenaline
taken up by the tissue may be stored in such a way that it
is protected from degradation, since only a small amount
ž5.5%. can be accounted for by metabolites. the resting
release of radioactivity was 3162 " 174 bqrg in 3 min
ž n s 48., representing 0.472 " 0.072 % of the radioactivity present in the tissue.
3.1. effect of cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx  actiõation on
[3h]noradrenaline release from the bronchi
when the bronchi were stimulated by the same number
of pulses ž180. but at different frequencies, there were
significant increases in the release of radioactivity. at 1, 3
and 10 hz stimulation rates the release was 4790 " 240,
5252 " 1587 and 8950 " 740 bqrg, respectively ž n s 6–
6.. tetrodotoxin at 0.5 mm completely inhibited the release at all frequencies applied ždata not shown..
the cannabinoid receptor agonist win-55,212-2 žcoutts
and pertwee, 1997. produced a concentration-dependent
inhibition of noradrenaline release žfig. 1., but its potency
depended on the frequency of stimulation applied. the
ic 50 of win-55,212-2 was 41.5 " 2.6 and 320.5 " 28.2
nm and the emax 61.5 " 4.3% and 31.7 " 2.2% inhibition
ž n s 5–5. at 1 and 3 hz, respectively. the cannabinoid

al., 1994. was studied with win-55,212-2 at concentrations of 0.081 and 0.01 mm. it shifted the concentration–
inhibition curves to the right in a parallel way. the pk b
value was 9.2 at 1 hz, and 9.3 at 3 hz. the shift was
compatible with competitive interaction.
sr 141716a administered alone at a concentration of 1
mm failed to increase the release žtable 1. evoked by 1
hz stimulation, but completely prevented win-55,212-2
from reducing the release of w3 hxnoradrenaline žtable 1..
3.2. effect of cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx  actiõation in the
presence and absence of a 2-adrenoceptor-mediated negatiõe feedback modulation
it is generally accepted that noradrenergic transmission
is subject to a 2-adrenoceptor-mediated negative feedback
modulation žcf. starke, 1977.. this was the case with the
release of noradrenaline in the bronchi. when ch-38083, a
selective a 2-adrenoceptor antagonist žvizi et al., 1986.,
was used to exclude a 2-adrenoceptor-mediated negative
feedback modulation of noradrenaline release, the release
in response to field stimulation ž3 hz, 180 shocks. was
significantly higher žfig. 2a., it amounted to 16 616 "
3811 bqrg vs. 510 " 1573 bqrg measured in control
experiments. indeed, a 2-adrenoceptor antagonism significantly enhanced the stimulation-evoked release žfig. 2a

3.3. localization of cb1 cannabinoid receptor on sympathetic nerõe terminals in the guinea pig lung
to verify the localization of cannabinoid cb1 receptors
on sympathetic nerve terminals, we combined immunogold
and immunoperoxidase staining for the cannabinoid cb1
receptor and  xxxg1590xxx , respectively.  xxxg1590xxx 
was used as a marker for sympathetic nerve fibers žbarnes,
1992.. since the intensity of immunogold staining for
cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx  was insufficient to reveal the
nerve fibers under the light microscope,  xxxg1590xxx 
immunostaining, providing more detailed fiber staining
žsee fig. 3a and b., was used to select axons for further
electron microscopic investigation.
in the electron microscope, most of the neuropeptide
y-positive axonal fibers were shown to express cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx  immunoreactivity. in the detailed analysis, five axon bundles scattered among the bronchial smooth
muscle cells, containing 21 individual axons, were followed through approximately 25–30 serial ultrathin sections. from these, 12 were  xxxg1590xxx -positive. none
of the  xxxg1590xxx -negative axons, but 9 out of the 12
 xxxg1590xxx -positive fibers, were positive for the
cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx  žfig. 3c and d1–2.. the number of gold particles representing the localization of the
receptor varied considerably; we found axons with 19 gold
particles, but two contained only one in the analyzed
2-mm-thick slabs of tissue.

4. discussion
two cannabinoid receptors have been identified to date;
cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx  is localized mainly in the central
nervous system, whereas cannabinoid cb 2 receptor is
located predominantly in immune cells žcf. pertwee, 1997;
lay et al., 2000.. rather strong neurochemical žkatona et
al., 1999, 2000., immunohistochemical žkatona et al.,
1999, 2000., and electrophysiological žameri et al., 1999;
misner and sullivan, 1999; hajos
´ et al., 2000; al-hayani
and davies, 2000; hoffman and lupica, 2000. evidence is
available that the cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx  subtype of
cannabinoid receptors is located presynaptically.
recently it was shown that there are release-modulating
cannabinoid receptors localized on the axon terminals of
gabažergic. interneurons in rat žkatona et al., 1999. and
human žkatona et al., 2000. hippocampus. in these studies,
neurochemical and immunohistochemical evidence was
obtained that the activation of cannabinoid cb1 receptors
results in inhibition of gaba release in response to axonal
stimulation, and that this subset of gabažergic. axons is
immunoreactive for cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx . in pharmacological experiments, presynaptic inhibitory cannabinoid cb1 receptors were shown on the cholinergic terminals in the hippocampus žgifford and ashby, 1996.. as far
as the effect of cannabinoids on transmitter release in the

periphery is concerned, it was shown that tetrahydrocannabinol or win-55,212-2 and the endogenous ligand anandamide inhibit the stimulation-evoked release of endogenous acetylcholine from guinea pig myenteric plexus
žcoutts and pertwee, 1997. and w3 hxnoradrenaline from
vas deferens žishac et al., 1996; trendelenburg et al.,
2000. and from the atria via an interaction with cannabinoid cb1 receptors žishac et al., 1996; niederhoffer and
szabo, 1999.. a cannabinoid cb 2 receptor-mediated inhibition was shown on acetylcholine release žspicuzza et al.,
2000. with cp 55,940. a cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx -mediated increase in hippocampal acetylcholine release was
shown žacquas et al., 2001. in response to cannabinoid
agonists assayed in vivo in microdialysis study. regional
differences in the cannabinoid receptor mrna levels in
response to win-55,212-2 suggest different weights of
cannabinoid influence among areas in the brain žromero et
al., 1999..
in our experiments, stimulation of cannabinoid cb1
receptors inhibited the release of labelled noradrenaline
from isolated bronchi in a concentration-dependent manner. at a lower stimulation rate ž1 hz., the ec 50 value for
win-55,212-2-mediated inhibition of noradrenaline release ž41.5 nm. is in reasonable agreement with the values
obtained by others for inhibition of w3 hxacetylcholine release žgifford and ashby, 1996. and w3 hxgaba release
žkatona et al., 1999. in hippocampal slices. at a higher
stimulation rate, the ec 50 value for win-55,212-2 is 320
nm. the inhibitory effect of win-55,212-2 is mediated by
cannabinoid cb1 receptors: sr 141716a, a cannabinoid
 xxxg479xxx -selective antagonist, fully antagonized the
effect of win-55,212-2 and shifted the dose–response
curves to the right. sr 141716a by itself failed to increase
the release of noradrenaline, indicating that there was no
ongoing release of endocannabinoids under our experimental conditions.
it is generally accepted that chemical signal transmission is subject to presynaptic modulation via auto- žfor
review see starke, 1977. and heteroreceptors žfor review
see vizi, 1985; fuder and muscholl, 1995; schlicker and
gothert, 1998.. in human and animal tissues, it has been
shown that these receptors located on the axon terminals
are targets of endogenous ligands and different drugs žcf.
vizi, 2000.. indeed, the noradrenergic terminals in the
bronchi are also equipped with a 2-adrenoceptors, whose
activation results in inhibition of noradrenaline release.
using a 2a -žarc-239. and a 2b -žbrl-44408.-selective antagonists, it was shown that brl-44408 and  xxxd3000xxx 
increased release indicating that a 2b -subtypes of a 2adrenoceptors are present on the varicosities involved in
negative feedback modulation žtable 1..
it has been shown žvasquez and lewis, 1999; calandra
et al., 1999. that cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx  activation can
sequester giro-proteins making them unavailable to couple
to receptors, i.e. a 2-adrenoceptors for noradrenaline and
somatostatin žvasquez and lewis, 1999.. therefore, the

fig. 4. functional interaction between cholinergic and noradrenergic
innervation of guinea pig airways: possible effects of cannabinoid cb1
receptor activation. stimulation of parasympathetic pathways results in
acetylcholine and vip release and causes bronchoconstriction, mucus
secretion and bronchovasodilatation. acetylcholine acts on the m 3 subtype of muscarinic receptors located on the smooth muscle. sympathetic
control of airways is mainly mediated via indirect action resulting in
bronchodilatation. there is a functional interaction between noradrenergic
and cholinergic neurons which are located nearby žjones et al., 1991.:
noradrenaline released from the sympathetic nerve inhibits the release of
acetylcholine via activation of a 2 -adrenoceptors žpaton and vizi, 1969;
grundstrom
¨ et al., 1981..  xxxg1590xxx  has a similar action. in
addition, the circulating adrenaline ža., especially during stress may
inhibit the release of acetylcholine and may have effect on b 2 -adrenoceptors located on the smooth muscle cells resulting in bronchodilatation.
note that cannabinoid cb1 receptors are located on the noradrenergic
varicosities. activation of these receptors by win 55,212-2 results in a
decrease in the release of noradrenaline and  xxxg1590xxx . the endogenous anandamide might have additional effects on  xxxd428xxx  receptors.
consequently, the release of acetylcholine increases and the activation of
b 2 -adrenoceptors located on the smooth muscle diminishes, resulting in a
m 3-receptor-mediated bronchospasm. it has been shown žspicuzza et al.,
2000. that cannabinoid agonist cp 55,940 žcb1 rcb 2 . and anandamide
inhibit acetylcholine release via activation of cb 2 receptors, but this
inhibitory action does not result in changes in functional responses, a fact
that may be due to several factors able to influence responsiveness of the
airways žfolkerts et al., 2001..

role of the cannabinoid cb1 receptors in heteroreceptormediated inhibition of noradrenaline release was also studied under conditions in which the negative feedback modulation of noradrenaline release via a 2-adrenoceptor was
absent. in the absence of a 2-adrenoceptor-mediated tonic
control, the release of w3 hxnoradrenaline was much higher
and cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx  activation was more effective: the amount of w3 hxnoradrenaline žexpressed in bqrg.
prevented from release was greater in the absence of
negative feedback modulation žtable 2.. these facts indicate that noradrenaline release is able to escape from
presynaptic tonic control by the endogenous ligand anandamide released locally in the lung in response to receptor

243

activation žcf. piomelli et al., 2000., under conditions in
which the a 2-adrenoceptor-mediated tonic control is dominant.
at the ultrastructural level, the cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx -immunoreactivity was exclusively confined to  xxxg1590xxx -positive axons. since  xxxg1590xxx  is a
co-transmitter in noradrenergic neurons žcf. barnes, 1992.,
the present finding indicates that in the lung, the noradrenergic axon terminals are equipped with cannabinoid cb1
receptors. this is in line with the recent observations of
calignano et al. ž2000.. in contrast, the present results also
suggest that  xxxg1590xxx -negative, probably parasympathetic fibers in the lung do not express cannabinoid cb1
receptors, which is supported by recent pharmacological
evidence for the lack of cannabinoid  xxxg479xxx -mediated effect on acetylcholine release from guinea pig trachea
žspicuzza et al., 2000.. the difference between the present
study and calignano et al. ž2000. may derive from either a
species difference or may be due to the inconsistent expression level of  xxxg1590xxx  in sympathetic neurons.
the active constituent of marijuana or the endogenous
cannabinoid anandamide may produce bronchospasms by
reducing the release of noradrenaline žfig. 4., provided the
bronchi are in relaxation in response to the tonic influence
of catecholamines via b 2-adrenoceptors žcf. hauck et al.,
1997. in which noradrenaline released from the sympathetic innervation is involved.
