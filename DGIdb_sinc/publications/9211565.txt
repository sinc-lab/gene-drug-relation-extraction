abstract

this study was designed to determine the gastroprotective
properties of  xxxd1703xxx  (cnt), a novel prokinetic benzamide
derivative agonist of  xxxg1117xxx  and 5-ht, receptors and 5-ht>
antagonist, on mucosal injury produced by 50% (v/v) ethanol.
results were compared with those for 5-hydroxytryptamine
(5-ht: 10 mg kg~!). the possible involvements of gastric
mucus secretion, endogenous prostaglandins (pgs) and sulf-
hydryl compounds (sh) in the protection mediated by cnt
were also examined. intraperitoneal administration of cnt
(0.50 and 1 mg kg-!), 30 min before ethanol, significantly pre-
vented gastric ulceration and increased the hexosamine con-
tent of gastric mucus. cnt (1 mg kg~') also produced a signifi-
cant increase in gastric mucosal levels of pge, but did not
induce any significant changes in sh values. on the contrary,
pretreatment with 5-ht worsened  xxxd102xxx induced erosions,
however, did not affect gastric mucus secretion, glycoprotein
content or pge; levels, although the non-protein sh fraction
was significantly decreased. the present results demonstrate
that the gastroprotective effects of cnt could be partly
explained by a complex pg dependent mechanism. we sug-
gest that 5-ht dependent mechanisms through 5-ht> recep-
tor blockade and 5-ht, receptor activation could be also
involved.

introduction

the presence of indoles, for example 5-
hydroxytryptamine (5-ht), in the gastroin-
testinal tract has been reported [1]. immuno-
cytochemical investigations have revealed
that 5-ht has a tripartite distribution, occur-
ring in mucosal mast cells, a subpopulation of
enteric neurons and the enterochromaffin
cells of rodents [2]. 5-ht plays an important
role in regulating gastrointestinal motility and
also gastric secretion [3, 4]. the amine has
been shown to possess ulcerogenic properties
[5, 6] and to be one of the pathological factors
mediating mucosal injury induced by ethanol
in the rat stomach [7].

on the other hand, it has been demon-
strated that properly coordinated motility
might be of crucial importance in promoting
the clearance of damaging agents from the
stomach by reducing their duration of contact
with the gastric mucosa [8] and could there-
fore be involved in the mechanism of gastro-
protection [9]. some prokinetic benzamides,
e.g. metoclopramide or  xxxd1708xxx , have been
effective in experimental models of gastric
ulceration [10] and could prevent ulcer re-
lapse after healing [11].

 xxxd1703xxx  (cnt) is a novel prokinetic
benzamide derivative which stimulates 5-
ht, and 5-ht, receptors and blocks the 5-
ht) receptor [12]. the aim of the current
study was to investigate the beneficial effects
of cnt on gastric mucosal injury induced by
50% (v/v) ethanol and to examine the possible
involvement of 5-ht-dependent mechanisms
in the cytoprotection mediated by cnt. in
the second stage of our study, two known
endogenous cytoprotective compounds were
examined as possible mediators of cnt-
induced gastroprotection: prostaglandins
(pgs) [13] and endogenous (protein and non-
protein) sulfhydryl compound (sh) [14] levels
in the gastric mucosa.

materials and methods

animals. wistar rats, weighing 180-220 g were
placed singly in cages with wire mesh floors in a con-
trolled room (temperature 22-24°c, humidity 70-
75%) and were fed a normal laboratory diet. the ani-
mals were deprived of food 24 h before experimenta-
tion but allowed free access to tap water throughout.
all studies were carried out using 6-8 rats per group.

drug preparation and treatment. cnt (lab. almi-
rall; 0.25, 0.50 and 1 mg kg-') and 5-ht (sigma, st.
louis, mo., usa); 10 mg kg-!) were dissolved in saline
(0.9% nacl), prepared freshly each time and adminis-
tered intraperitoneally. control rats received saline in
a comparable volume (0.2 ml/100 g).  xxxd2352xxx 
(ind, sigma; 10 mg kg-'), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor,
was given intraperitoneally.  xxxd2684xxx  (nem,
sigma, 10 mg kg-') an sh alkylator, was given subcu-
taneously. different control groups were employed,
receiving saline alone (c.1) or saline plus ethanol (c.2)
also at different times and in a comparable volume,
(0.2 mi/100g, i.p.).

protection against 50% (v/v) ethanol. ulceration
was induced as described by wong et al. [7] by instilla-
tion of 1 ml/100g of 50% (v/v) ethanol in distilled
water. the drugs were injected intraperitoneally in dif-
ferent doses, cnt (| 0.50 and 1 mg kg-!) and 5-
ht (10 mg kg-!) to different groups of animals and at
various intervals (30, 60 and 120 min) before the oral
administration of ethanol, and 5-ht (10 mg kg-') fol-
lowed 30 min later by cnt (1 mg kg-!) and a further
30 min by ethanol. one hour later, the animals were
sacrificed using an overdose of  xxxd2052xxx  and their
stomachs removed and opened along the greater curva-
ture. any lesions were examined macroscopically.
hemorrhagic lesions were measured macroscopically
and expressed as gastric damage (mm_?). results were
compared with different control groups which received
saline alone (c. 1) and saline plus ethanol (c. 2).

biochemical study of the gastric mucus. the gas-
tric mucus was obtained by scraping the mucosa with a
glass slide and was immediately homogenized in 4 ml
of weighed distilled water. in order to avoid variations
in either the criteria of gastric mucosal lesions or the
scraping technique, a single-blind method was used
where the treatment regimen was unknown to the
investigator. the weight of mucus (g) was the differ-
ence between the weight of the homogenate and that of
the original 4 ml of water [15]. total proteins (mg
ml-!) were determined from one portion of the homog-
enate (1 ml) following the colorimetric technique of
lowry et al. [16]. the hexosamine content (1g ml-!)

 

alareén-de-la-lastra romero/lépez/
martin/la casa/motilva
was determined from a second portion of the homoge-
nate (2 ml). this was subjected firstly to acid hydroly-
sis with | n hcl, and then to a reaction in the presence
of p-dimethyl-aminobenzaldehyde according to the
method decribed by boas [17].

microscopic and morphometric evaluation of gas-
tric mucus. four groups of 6 rats each were used: con-
 xxxd3105xxx  | (non-ulcerated control group); control 2 (ulcer-
ated control group); s-ht (10 mg kg~!, i.p.) and  xxxg2129xxx 
(1 mg kg-!, i.p.) followed 30 min later by 50% (v/v)
ethanol. the method described by escolar et al. [18]
was applied. after sacrifice, the rat stomach was ex-
posed and an incision was made in the duodenum. a
polyethylene cannula was placed into the stomach via
the esophagus, and the gastric lumen was washed with
10-15 ml saline. in order to maintain a similar intra-
gastric pressure in all animals, the gastric cavity was
perfused with the same amount of carnoy fixative
through a cannula. after the solution had emptied
through the duodenal incision, the esophagus and duo-
denum were ligated. fifteen minutes later, the stomach
was removed and placed in the same fixative solution.
smaller pieces cut from the glandular portion near the
junction of the limiting ridge and greater curvature
were dehydrated with ethanol and embedded in paraf-
fin. gastric glands from macroscopically intact muco-
sa were used. two series of sections (5 um thick, sepa-
rated by at least 1 mm), were made by cutting the block
in a plane perpendicular to the mucosal suface. sec-
tions were stained with periodic acid-schiff (pas), and
alcian blue (ph 0.5, ab). a video image analyzer ccd
camera mintron coupled to an olympus microscope
was used for the morphometric study. the sections
were evaluated in randomized blinded fashion by a
histologist who was unaware of the experimental pro-
tocol. the following parameters were considered.

total glycoprotein content. cross-sectional areas
of the portion of the gland stained red by pas were
measured to give the total glycoprotein content present
in the gastric pits.

sulfated macromolecular content. cross-sectional
areas of the gastric gland stained blue by the ab meth-
od were measured to give the sulfated macromolecular
content in the gastric pits. in these assays, the mean
length of gastric mucosa examined from each stomach
(mm) and the pas-/ and ab-positive areas were tabu-
lated and expressed as square micrometers per milli-
meter of mucosa length examined.

role of pg in gastric mucosal protection: measure-
ment of pge in gastric mucosa. in order to study the
effect of inhibition of endogenous pg synthesis by
ind, new groups of animals were employed. ind

administration (10 mg kg~!, i.p.) was followed 30 min
later by saline or cnt (1 mg kg-!, i.p.) and 30 min lat-
er by ethanol. with the ind dose chosen, mucosal pg
generation was inhibited almost completely by the
drug according to previous studies [19, 20]. the pge)
content in the gastric mucosa was evaluated in new
groups of rats: cnt (0.25, 0.50 and | mg kg-!, i.p.) and
5-ht (10mg kg-!, i.p.) were administered 30 min
before ethanol (optimum time of treatment for cnt),
or 5-ht (10 mg kg-') followed 30 min later by cnt
(1 mg kg-!) and 30 min later by ethanol. results were
compared with different non-treated and ethanol-
treated control groups. thereafter rats were killed,
their stomachs removed, opened along the greater cur-
vature and rinsed with 0.9% saline. gastric mucosa
was minced with a scalpel and homogenized in 4 ml
cold triethylammonium formate buffer 0.04 mol i-!,
ph 3.15, with 15% ethanol. the homogenate was cen-
trifuged (18,000 g, 10 min, 4°c). the supernatant was
removed and kept cool until assayed for pge.

the method described by navarro et al. [21] was
used for the analytical determination of prostanoids.
briefly, the supernatant was passed through a reverse-
phase octadecylsilica c18 sep pak cartridge which was
washed with 0.05 mol/i-! triethylammonium formate
buffer ph 3.15 (10 ml) and petroleum ether (10 ml).
the final elution was accomplished with 5 ml methyl-
formate. the eluate from the last fraction was collected
in polypropylene tubes and maintained at -40°c until
analysis. each fraction was evaporated and dissolved
in 100 mmol i-! tris-hci! buffer, ph 7.4. pge: was
determined in two 200-u1 samples using a ria kit
(eria, diagnostic pasteur, france) and 3h as tracer.

involvement of endogenous sh in gastric mucosal
protection: determination of mucosal sh groups.
fasted rats received a dose of 10 mg kg-! s.c. of nem
followed 30 min later by saline or cnt (1 mg kg-!,
ip.) and a further 30 min later by ethanol. rats were
autopsied | h after ethanol administration and their
stomachs were processed as indicated above. the
amount of mucosal sulfhydryls was measured in the
gastric mucosa of other groups of rats after administra-
tion of cnt (0.25, 0.50 and | mg kg~!, i.p.), 5-ht
(10 mg kg-!, ip.) and 5-ht (10 mg kg-!) followed
30 min later by cnt (1 mg kg!) and 30 min later by
ethanol, according to the method described by garg et
al. [22]. 1 ml of 50% (v/v) ethanol/100 g was given by
gavage 30 min after administration of the drugs. one
hour later, the animals were sacrificed, their stomachs
removed, opened, rinsed in ice-cold sodium phosphate
buffer (0.2 mol i-!, ph 8.0), and quickly placed on an
ice-cold surface for scraping off the glandular mucosa.

the scrapings were then suspended in 2 ml sodium
phosphate buffer, homogenized in an ice bath, and
centrifuged at 2,400 g for 10 min at 4°c. the superna-
tant sulfhydryl content was determined [23]; for deter
mination of total sulfhydryls, 0.1-ml aliquot of super-
natant was mixed with 2.9 ml of  xxxd3449xxx  (0.2 mol
i-!, ph 8.2) and 0.05 ml of 5,5’-dithio-bis(2-nitroben-
zoic acid (0,01 mol i-') in methanol, for non-protein
sulfhydryls, a 1-ml aliquot of supernatant was mixed

color was developed for 10-15 min. the absorbance
at 412 nm, against a reagent blank, was measured with
a spectrophotometer (perkin-elmer, 1310). protein
sulfhydryl levels were obtained by subtracting non-
protein sulfhydryl! values from that of the total sulfhy-
dryls. sulfhydryl concentrations, calculated from
freshly prepared standard curves of glutathione (gsh)
(sigma), were expressed as micromoles per gram tis-
sue.

in contral rats, oral administration of  xxxg2030xxx -
nol for 60 min produced severe hemorrhagic
bands of lesions in the corpus mucosa along
the long axis of the stomach. the area of the
gastric damage was 106.40 + 17.75 mm?. on
the contrary, pretreatment with cnt (0.25,
0.50 and | mg kg-!, i.p.) significantly (fisher
test, a < 0.05) prevented ulceration although
no dose dependency was observed (fig. 1).

the cnt-treated groups showed a corre-
lative increase in the hexosamine concentra-
tion of gastric mucus (newman-keuls test,

significant differences in the amount of gas-
tric mucus and total protein concentration
were found in comparison with the ulcerated
control group (control 2; table 1). the maxi-
mal protection by cnt was achieved 30 min
before ethanol administration (30.03 +

smaller at 60 and 120 min (fig. 2a). there

coproteins), although no significant effect was
observed in the ab area (sulfated glycopro-

 xxxd3105xxx  1 and control 2.

cantly (fisher test, a < 0.05) inhibited gastric
protection by cnt (1 mg kg~'; fig. 1) and the
result noted for pge) levels in the gastric
mucosa indicated that cnt (1 mg kg-!) pro-
duced significant increases in the prostanoid
content (pg mg”! tissue; table 3).

in the non-protein and protein fractions
(fig. 3).

pretreatment with 5-ht (10 mg kg-') 30,
60 or 120 min before ethanol administration
worsened the  xxxd102xxx induced erosions. the
lesion index was maximal at 30 min, becom-
ing smaller thereafter (fig. 2), however, 5-ht
treatment did not significantly affect gastric
mucus content, glycoprotein concentration
(table 1) or pge) levels (table 3), although the
non-protein sh fraction was significantly de-
creased (newman-keuls test, f¢6,47) = 43.15 >
2,34, a < 0.05; fig. 3). 5-ht plus ethanol
administration inhibited the protective ef-
fects of cnt. the intensity of mucosal lesions
increased (fig. 1) and pge) levels of mucosal
(table 3) and non-protein sh content (fig. 3)
were lower in this group.

our experiments have shown protective
properties of cnt (0.25, 0.50 and 1 mg kg-').

intragastric instillation of ethanol and in-
creased the glycoprotein content. at the same
time ind, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, partial-
ly reversed cnt protection, suggesting that
the beneficial anti-ulcer effects of this drug
could be mediated by pgs. following the
administration of a mild irritant such as  xxxg2030xxx -
nol (v/v 50%) subsequently, there is a signifi-
cant inhibition of mucosal synthesis of pge,

el, cnt induced increases in gastric levels of
pge) with respect to the  xxxd102xxx treated con-
trols.

the role of prostanoids, classical media-
tors of protection, has been demonstrated in
numerous studies. the mechanisms by which
pgs contribute to mucosal protection include
the prevention of gastric barrier disruption,
the enhancement in phospholipid and bicar-
bonate secretion and the stimulation of cellu-
lar transport processes and macromolecular
synthesis [9, 24]. moreover, it could be possi-
ble that pgs exert cytoprotective effects
through the preservation of the gastric endo-
thelial microcirculation leading to a mainte-
nance of the mucosal blood flow [25]. in addi-
tion, pgs also have a number of effects on

protection of  xxxd1703xxx  against

gastric mucus. studies in animals and/or hu-
mans indicate that pgs and pg analogues
increase the thickness of the mucus gel layer,
stimulate mucus secretion and synthesis and
change the characteristics of mucus toward a
glycoprotein structure that is more resistant to
acid and pepsin degradation [26].

pharmacology 1997;54:193-202 199
the protective effect of mucus as an active
barrier may be attributed largely to its viscous
and gel-forming properties which are derived
from mucin glycoprotein constituents. these
components have the property of holding wa-
ter in their interstices, thus forming a barrier
against the diffusion of hydrogen ions [27].

pgs have also been suggested to reduce the
release of inflammatory mediators derived
from mast cells ( xxxd2973xxx , his-
tamine,  xxxg2296xxx -a) [28]. mast
cells can also release a number of archidonate
lipoxygenase products, including leukotriene
c4, which can exert powerful vasoconstrictor
actions on the mucosal microcirculation and
augment mucosal injury [29]. leukotriene re-
lease from the gastric mucosa can be detected
following exposure to ethanol [30] and indeed
such a release can be inhibited by 16,16-dime-
thyl pge> [31].

on the other hand, experimental evidence
indicates that endogenous sh groups play an
important role in maintaining the integrity of
the gastric mucosa.  xxxd102xxx induced injury to
the gastric mucosa is associated with a signifi-
cant decrease in mucosal sh content, espe-
cially, of gsh tissue levels in experimental
animals [32]. sh-containing compounds and
also agents that modify, oxidize or bind sh
groups, prevent the acute hemorrhagic ero-
sions caused by ethanol, nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs or stress in animal mod-
els. nevertheless, our data revealed that pre-
treatment with cnt did not significantly in-
crase sh levels but reduced the gastric necro-
sis induced by 50% v/v ethanol, therefore it
was assumed that endogenous sh did not
contribute to the functional protection mech-
anisms exerted by cnt in this experimental
model.

the present study also investigated the
effects of 5-ht on lesion formation and the
possible involvement of 5-ht mechanisms in
the antiulcer effect of cnt.

200 pharmacology 1997:54:193-202

5-ht is known to be present in the gas-
trointestinal tract and is localized in the ente-
rochromaffin cells in the enteric nerves and in
mucosal mast cells. 5-ht of neuronal origin
has been implicated mainly in controlling gas-
trointestinal motor function, eliciting contrac-
tion or relaxation by activation of a wide vari-
ety of mechanisms and receptors. stimulation
of 5-ht> receptors in smooth muscle pro-
duces constriction of most vessels, however,
activation of 5-ht, receptors causes vasodila-
tion through the release of endothelium-de-
rived relaxing factor and pgs [33].

the amine has been shown to have signifi-
cant biological activities, such as inhibition of
gastric secretion [3] and mucosal ulcerogenici-
ty [34]. recently, cho et al. [35] have indi-
cated that the ulcerogenic action of 5-ht is
likely to be mediated through a depressive
action on the gastric mucosal blood flow
which is brought about not only by the reduc-
tion in systemic blood pressure via 5-ht,
receptors but also by the constriction of muco-
sal blood vessels through 5-ht receptors.
this could ultimately induce ischemia in the
tissue and increase free radical production
and lesion formation in the gastric mucosa.
our results are in agreement with those of
cho et al. [36, 37] and show a potentiation of
 xxxd102xxx evoked mucosal damage after 5-ht
administration. the amine also showed a ten-
dency to decrease the mucus content from
0.66 + 0.10g (ulcerated control group) to
0.44 + 0.04 g. in addition, our findings indi-
cate that 5-ht decreased the mucosal gsh
concentration in the  xxxd102xxx treated gastric
mucosa, however, it did not significantly
change pge} levels. these findings imply that
a reduction in sh levels could also be one of
the factors aggravating  xxxd102xxx evoked muco-
sal injury.

although the mechanisms of action of
cnt are incompletely characterized, a num-
ber of studies suggest that cnt is effective in

alarcén-de-la-lastra romero/lépez/
martin/la casa/motilva
models measuring effects mediated via stimu-
lation of 5-ht, receptors [38] or via inhibi-
tion of 5-ht> receptors. in the pithed rat
preparation, for example, cnt blocked the 5-
ht>-receptor-mediated pressor response to in-
travenous injection of 5-ht, being 7 and 10
times more potent than ritanserin and ketan-
serin, respectively [39]. by the same token,
cnt blocked the 5-ht>-mediated head shak-
ing induced by quipazine in the mouse, being
equipotent to ritanserin in this model. thus it
is possible that the protective action of the drug
on ethanol ulceration could be partially ex-
plained by its agonist and antagonist activity
on 5-ht, and 5-ht> receptors, respectively.
in addition, cnt is a prokinetic agent
which stimulates motility in the gastrointesti-
nal tract by indirectly facilitating acetylcho-
line release from the myenteric plexus
through the stimulation of the  xxxg1117xxx  recep-
tor. in contrast to other benzamides, cnt

does not antagonize  xxxg1116xxx  activa-
tion [40]. it has been reported that a delay in
gastric emptying and an increased duodeno-
gastric reflex are important factors in the cau-
sation of gastric ulcers [10]. it has also been
suggested that properly coordinated motility
might be of crucial importance in promoting
acid clearance and could therefore be an unre-
cognized factor in the pathogenesis of peptic
ulceration [8]. thus it can be presumed that
increasing gastroprokinesis could also con-
tribute to the beneficial effects of cnt. in
conclusion, the present study demonstrates
the antiulcer action of cnt on ethanol-
induced mucosal injury that could be partly
explained through a complex pg-dependent
mechanism although other factors could be
implicated. we suggest that 5-ht-dependent
mechanisms through 5-ht>-receptor block-
ade and 5-ht; receptor activation could be
also involved.
