at low concentrations,  xxxd118xxx  inhibits yeast cell multiplication by acting on oxidative metabolism• studies on isolated
mitochondria display the following features: (i)  xxxd118xxx  inhibits atpase activity and decreases a t p / o ratio during

any change in the magnitude of ap; (iv) the higher the atp synthesis and respiratory fluxes, the larger is the decrease

uncoupler nor as previously studied non protonophoric uncouplers (e.g., general anesthetics). our data show a direct
inhibitory effect of aimitrine on atpase-atp synthase complex• but, in contrast to the classical inhibitors of this
complex,  xxxd118xxx  decreases the a t p / o ratio in a flux-dependent manner. thus,  xxxd118xxx  could induce either an
intrinsic uncoupling of h+-atpase (i.e., slip in this  xxxg215xxx ) or a change in the mechanistic h + / a t p

introduction

 xxxd118xxx  is used for the irhprovement in blood gases
of patients with chronic bronchitis [1]. in addition,
possible metabolic effects of this drug have been proposed: namely increase in rate of cerebral metabolic
recovery in senescent rat [2]; increase by low  xxxd118xxx 
concentration and decrease by high  xxxd118xxx  concentration in coupling between oxidation and phosphorylation
in rat brain mitochondria [3]; inhibition of electron
transfer at bc i complex level in rat liver mitochondria
[4]. moreover, in isolated hepatocytes, we have shown
that this drug decreases gluconogenesis and increases
glycolysis from dihydroxyacetone as a direct consequence of a drop in both cytosolic and mitochondrial
a t p / a d p ratios [5]. these facts, put together, suggested an effect of  xxxd118xxx  on oxidative phosphorylation in different kinds of mammalian mitochondria.
this paper provides evidence that  xxxd118xxx  inhibits
yeast cell growth essentially through its effect on oxidaabbreviations: cccp,carboxylcyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone;pi,
inorganic phosphate; aph, transmembrane difference of ph; a~b,
transmembrane difference of electrical potential; ap, protonmotive
force.

tive metabolism. the study carried out on isolated
mitochondria indicates that  xxxd118xxx  decreases the coupling efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation by a
mechanism inconsistent with classical uncoupling (protonophoric effect) and that the direct effect of this drug
on atp synthase differs from those observed with other
known inhibitors.
materials and methods
culture conditions and mitochondria preparation. cells
of the diploid wild strain saccharomyces cereoisiae (yeast
foam) were grown aerobically at 28°c in a complete
medium: 1% yeast extract, 0.1% potassium phosphate,
0.12% ammonium sulfate (ph 4.5), supplemented either
with 2% sodium lactate or 10% glucose as carbon source.
the cells grown on 2% lactate complete medium were
harvested in logarithmic phase. mitochondria were isolated from protoplasts as in ref. 6. the protein concentration was estimated by the  xxxd2444xxx  method using
bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a standard.
respiration assay a n d a t p / o measurements. the
oxygen consumption rate was measured polarographically at 27°c using a clark electrode connected to a
microcomputer giving an on-line display of rate values.
the respiratory medium was as follows: 0.55 m mannitoi, 10 mm tris-maleate (ph 6.7), 0.36 mm egta,
0.3% bovine  xxxg124xxx , 3 mm tris-p i, 10 ~tm rbc1

average of phosphorylation rates vs. respiratory rates in
two different systems: (i) atp production was monitored either by  xxxd1292xxx  formation in the
presence of non-limiting amount of hexokinase, 1 mm
mgci2 and 10 mm glucose, or (ii) by labelled pi incorporation in adenine nucleotides as described in ref. 7.
these two methods gave identical results indicating that
neither contaminating atpase activity nor adenylate
kinase activity changed significantly the atp synthesis
rate estimations.

growth inhibition
in yeast, energy for growth is supplied from the
fermentation or from the aerobic metabolic pathway.
as shown on fig. 1,  xxxd118xxx  inhibits cell multiplication essentially through its effect on oxidative metabo-

lism, since this drug shows an efficient inhibitor effect
for non-fermentative medium (fig. 1a) but only a little
effect for fermentative medium at high  xxxd118xxx  concentration (fig. 1b). a complete cell-growth inhibition
was obtained for 200 ~m  xxxd118xxx  with lactate as the
carbon source.

mitochondria were suspended in 1.5 ml of respiratory medium (see materials and methods) supplemented with 0.66% ethanol in the absence or in
the presence of various concentrations of  xxxd118xxx . atp synthesis (o) and respiratory rates were obtained either with 1 mm adp addition, state 3
(o) or with 3 ~tm cccp, uncoupled respiration (*) in (a). protonmotive force (*) and a t p / o ratio (o) were obtained during state 3 respiration
as indicated above (b). other experimental conditions are given in the materials and methods section. respiratory control (r.c.) (o) is the slope
ratio between state 3 and state 4 respiration (b).

oxidative phosphorylation efficiency
we have tested, on isolated mitochondria, the effect
of  xxxd118xxx  on overall oxidative phosphorylation. as
shown on fig. 2a,  xxxd118xxx  strongly inhibited the a t p
synthesis. the respiratory rate in state 3 was only
slightly inhibited; the uncoupled respiration was not
affected by the drug indicating that respiratory activity
itself is not inhibited. fig. 2b shows that a t p / o ratio
decreased largely while the  xxxd118xxx  concentration
increased (fig. 2b). respiratory control (state 3 / s t a t e 4
ratio) and protonmotive force measured during state 3
respiration were not significantly modified by  xxxd118xxx 
addition indicating that a t p / o ratio decrease is not a
consequence of protonophoric effect of the drug.
table i shows that addition of 22.4 ~ m  xxxd118xxx  led
to a decrease in a t p / o whatever the substrate, except
when 2-oxoglutarate is used. it should be noted that, for
a given  xxxd118xxx  concentration, the higher the a t p
synthesis rate, the larger the effect of  xxxd118xxx  is.
moreover,  xxxd118xxx  does not inhibit uncoupled respiration whatever the substrate used.
a tpase activity
although protonophoric uncouplers stimulate the
respiration of isolated yeast mitochondria and inhibit
some energy-linked reactions [11,12], the atpase activity assayed with added atp, is only observed at alkaline p h [8,13] as a consequence of a kinetic limitation
in a t p influx [14]. oligomycin-sensitive atpase activity measured at p  xxxd736xxx .4 is inhibited by  xxxd118xxx  (fig.
3a) with 50% inhibition for 30 ~ m  xxxd118xxx . this value
is higher than the concentration for half inhibition of
phosphorylation (see fig. 2). this difference in sensitiv-

ity essentially seems due to the difference of ph, since
the sensitivity of partial reaction catalyzed by oligomycin-sensitive atpase (atp-p, exchange) which can be
observed at more physiological p h (7.4) is highly sensitive to  xxxd118xxx  (not shown). the inhibition of atpase
is uncompetitive as shown in fig. 3b.
comparison between  xxxd118xxx  and other mitochondrial
a tpase inhibitors
in order to compare the action of  xxxd118xxx  with that
of the well-known inhibitors of atpase activity, the
titration of a t p synthesis and respiratory rates has
been performed with oligomycin (acting on f 0 part) or
aurovertin d (acting on f~) [15]. fig. 4 shows that
 xxxd118xxx  decreases the a t p / o ratio value even though
the respiratory rate is slightly inhibited in contrast to
oligomycin and aurovertin d effects.
we have observed that the decrease in a t p / o ratio
induced by a constant concentration of  xxxd118xxx  seems
dependent on the rate of a t p synthesis (see table i).
however, it is not greatly informative to compare the
a t p / o value obtained with different respiratory substrates even as % of control. therefore, for a given
respiratory substrate, we measured a t p synthesis and
respiratory rates when these fluxes were modulated by
antimycin, in the presence or in the absence of a given
 xxxd118xxx  concentration (fig. 5). as previously observed
in m a m m a l i a n mitochondria [16-18], antimycin addition
to yeast mitochondria leads to a decrease of both fluxes
without significant change in a t p / o value. but, in the
presence of 22.4 p,m of  xxxd118xxx , the decrease in atp
production and respiratory rate, induced by various
concentrations of antimycin, is such that the a t p / o

discussion

 xxxd118xxx  inhibits yeast cell multiplication essentially
by acting on oxidative metabolism. its action on isolated mitochondria can be summarized as follows: (i)
 xxxd118xxx  inhibits atp synthesis and atpase activities.
the observation that atpase activity measured at p h
8.4 is sensitive to alrnitfine excludes that the adenine
nucleotide translocator was involved in this process.
indeed, at high p h value, atp enters into mitochondria
by a way insensible to atractyloside [12,13]; (ii) almitfine inhibits also state 3 respiration but in a lower
extent than the atp synthesis. this leads to a decrease
in a t p / o ratio by  xxxd118xxx ; (iii) this drug inhibits
only slightly the state 4 respiration but does not inhibit
the respiration stimulated by a protonophore (cccp);
(iv) finally, it does not decrease the protonmotive force.
moreover, it is worth noting that the effect of almitfine on a t p / o ratio depends on the respiratory and
atp synthesis flux values; the larger the fluxes the
lower the a t p / o value. this feature could explain the
lack of a t p / o decrease by almitfine when 2-oxoglutarate is used as respiratory substrate (see table i). indeed,
by substrating participation of the substrate level phosphorylation [19], the oligomycin-sensitive atpsynthesis
is only about 250 nmol atp per rain per mg protein
and uncoupling, induced by almitfine, is undetectable
for such a low flux when ethanol is used as substrate.
 xxxd118xxx  appears to act essentially on the a t p

synthase complex. but its effect is very different from
that of classical atp synthase inhibitors, such as
oligomycin or aurovertin d, which decrease atp
synthesis and respiratory rates in such a manner that
a t p / o ratio remains constant. recently a new type of
uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation has been
described in the literature. for instance, the general
anesthetics, such as chloroform or halothane, inhibit
atp synthesis, stimulate mitochondrial atpase activity
and state 4 respiration like pure protonophoric uncouplers but have no measurable effect on the magnitude of
ap [20]. but  xxxd118xxx  acts differently, since it does not
stimulate state 4 respiration and atpase activity as
general anesthetics do.
therefore, by comparing the effect of  xxxd118xxx  to
that of different kinds of inhibitors and uncouplers, it
clearly appears that  xxxd118xxx  corresponds to a new type
of mitochondrial energy-transduction inhibitor. its main
characteristic is that  xxxd118xxx  appears to decrease the
efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation by acting essentially on a t p synthase complex. it shall be noted that
 xxxd118xxx  does not inhibit atpase activity of the isolated f1 moiety nor the atpase activity of mitochondria, which are devoided of functional f0 moiety
(not shown) suggesting that the  xxxd118xxx  target is the
membranal f0 sector or f 1 as part of the entire complex. the fact that  xxxd118xxx  produces a parallel shift of
the double reciprocal plot of atpase activity in dependence with atp concentration cannot be clearly interpreted. indeed, such a behaviour, classified as uncompetitive inhibition, could occur for an enzyme when the
inhibitor acts on the enzyme-substrate complex, but

329
the fact that  xxxd118xxx  does not stimulate the respiration
in state 4 shows no modification of the respiratory
complex efficiency, but strongly suggests a flux dependent change in the h +/atp ratio due to a direct action
of  xxxd118xxx  on the atp synthase. two explanations
can be proposed; (i)  xxxd118xxx  increases intrinsic uncoupling of the h +/atpase also called slip [22,23]. such a
mechanism has been proposed for different kinds of
uncoupler which act both on atp synthase and respiratory chain by decreasing the efficiency of proton pumps
[24,2]; (ii)  xxxd118xxx  changes the real h + / a t p ratio of
atp synthase, for instance, by modifying the conformational protein transition during the catalytic cycle. experiments are underway for testing these possibilities.
