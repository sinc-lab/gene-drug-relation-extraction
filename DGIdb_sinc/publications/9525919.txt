the ability to sensitize cardiac muscle to ca21 would have
promising therapeutic potential for the treatment for ca21
desensitization that is associated with congestive heart failure
due to acute myocardial infarction and associated ischemia (1).
ideally, the mechanism of sensitization would not involve altering ca21 transients in myocardial cells that are already
metabolically challenged. regulatory proteins located on the
thin filament of cardiac muscle are logical targets for such
therapeutic compounds since they respond to cellular ca21
levels but are not involved in modulation of ca21 transients.

receptor on the thin filament of slow skeletal and cardiac striated muscle. cardiac muscle contraction is initiated when ca21
binds to the n-terminal regulatory metal binding site ii in
ctnc. muscle relaxation occurs upon release of ca21 from this
regulatory site. this central role for ctnc makes it an attractive target for putative ca21-sensitizing compounds designed
to modify the ca21 dependence of cardiac muscle contraction.
indeed, precedents have been established for both desensitization and sensitization of cardiac muscle to ca21 via mechanisms that involve ctnc. phosphorylation of ser-22 and -23
 xxxg2309xxx  ( xxxg2309xxx ), which is constitutively associated
with ctnc in the troponin complex, leads to a decrease in the
ca21 sensitivity of cardiac muscle fibers and myofibrils (2) and
to a decrease in the affinity of site ii in ctnc (3). in contrast, a
variety of small hydrophobic compounds including the calmodulin antagonists  xxxd318xxx  (4 – 6),  xxxd3431xxx  (tfp) (7), and
calmidazolium (7–9) have the opposite effect of increasing the
ca21 sensitivity of cardiac muscle preparations.  xxxd318xxx  has
been shown to increase the affinity of ctnc for ca21 by decreasing the ca21 off-rate (5, 6). such reports have led to a
search for new generations of ca21-sensitizing compounds with
greater specificity for ctnc (1).
knowledge of the structure of ctnc and identification of
potential drug binding sites on this protein would help facilitate the design or selection of ca21-sensitizing compounds with
desired pharmacological effects. until recently, high resolution
structural information was only available for the fast skeletal
isoform of tnc (stnc) (10, 11). structural models for ca21bound ctnc have been proposed based on the structures of
stnc and calmodulin. not surprisingly, these models predict
an open n-terminal regulatory domain of ca21-bound ctnc,
with an exposed hydrophobic surface similar to the structure of
stnc and calmodulin. existing models for drug binding to
ctnc propose that these compounds bind to this exposed nterminal hydrophobic pocket (5, 12, 13). recently, the nmr
solution structures of ca21-bound intact ctnc (14), and the apo
and ca21-saturated n-terminal regulatory fragment (15) were
reported. the most striking feature of these structures is that
the ca21-bound n-terminal regulatory domain is partially
closed, resulting in significantly less exposed hydrophobic surface than found in ca21-bound stnc. these structures have
significant implications with respect to drug binding sites in
ctnc.
the goal of the current study was to generate structural
information on the binding of  xxxd318xxx  and tfp to full-length
ctnc and to correlate these data with the solution structure of
this critical ca21-regulatory protein. we chose both drugs
based on their known ca21-sensitizing affects on ctnc. the
data presented here, coupled with our previous study using
covalent blocking groups (16), support a model in which bepri-

the solution structure of  xxxg2307xxx  (ctnc)
(sia, s., li, m. x., spyracopoulos, l., gagne, s. m., liu, w.,
putkey, j. a. & sykes, b. d. (1997) j. biol. chem. 272,
18216 –18221) challenges existing structure/function
models for this critical regulatory protein. for example,
it is clear that the closed conformation of the regulatory
n-terminal domain in ca21-bound  xxxg2307xxx 
(ctnc) presents a much different binding surface for
ca21-sensitizing compounds than previously thought.
we report here the use of met methyl groups as sitespecific structural markers to identify drug binding
sites for  xxxd3431xxx  and  xxxd318xxx  on ctnc. drug dependent changes in the nmr heteronuclear single-quantum coherence spectra of [methyl-13c]met-labeled ctnc
indicate that  xxxd318xxx  and  xxxd3431xxx  bind to similar sites but only in the presence of ca21. there are 3– 4
drug binding sites in the n- and c-terminal domains of
intact ctnc that exhibit fast exchange on the nmr time
scale. use of a novel spin-labeled phenothiazine and
detection of isotope-filtered nuclear overhauser effects
allowed identification of drug binding sites in the shallow hydrophobic cup in the c-terminal domain and on
two hydrophobic surfaces on the n-terminal regulatory
domain. the data presented here, coupled with our previous study using covalent blocking groups, support a
model in which the ca21-sensitizing binding site includes met-45 in helix b of site i, and met-60 and -80 in
helices b and c of the regulatory site ii. this subregion
in ctnc makes a likely target against which to design
new and selective ca21-sensitizing compounds.

 xxxd318xxx  and tfp binding sites on  xxxg2307xxx 

dil and tfp bind to multiple sites on ctnc, including two
hydrophobic surfaces in the n-terminal domain. the ca21sensitizing binding site is predicted to be a hydrophobic patch
that includes met-45 in helix b of site i and met-60 and -80 in
helices b and c of the regulatory site ii. this subregion in ctnc
makes a likely target against which to design new and selective
ca21-sensitizing compounds.

chemicals— xxxd318xxx , and 4-amino-tempo were purchased from
sigma. tfp, 2-(trifluoromethyl)phenothiazine, tetrahydrofuran, and
1,3-dibromopropane were obtained from aldrich.  xxxd2595xxx -methyl-13c, l-phenylalanine (d8), tris-d11, deuterium oxide,  xxxd1896xxx -d6, and methanol-d were obtained from cambridge isotope
labs.
nmr sample preparation—the bacterial expression of ctnc( xxxd68xxx )
(17), its labeling with [methyl-13c]met (18) and the purification of
recombinant ctnc proteins (19) were reported previously. to eliminate
the possibility of noes being detected between the phe residues and
[methyl-13c]met residues in the drug-protein complexes, the protein
was labeled with  xxxd2433xxx  (d8). the nmr samples varied in protein concentration from 0.2 to 3.5 mm in 20 mm tris-d11, 200 mm kcl, and d2o
at ph 7.0.
nmr methods—all spectra were collected at 40 °c using bruker
amx500 or gn500 nmr spectrometers. hsqc (20) spectra were
collected with 1024 complex data points in the t2 domain and 72
increments in t1 at 40 °c. the 1h and 13c spectra widths were 6012
and 600 hz, respectively. 1h and 13c chemical shifts were reported
relative to the hdo signal at 4.563 ppm and the [methyl-13c]met
signal at 14.86 ppm, respectively. all spectra were processed using
the felix software package (biosyms technologies, inc.). the 1h-13c
correlations for [methyl-13c]ctnc( xxxd68xxx ) were assigned by comparison to known assignments for ctnc (c35s) (18). noes between
 xxxd318xxx  and ctnc( xxxd68xxx ) were obtained from a 2d noesy experiment using 13c(v1,v2)-double-half-filter (21, 22). a mixing time of
310 ms was used for the complex. the 1h spectra widths were 6012
and 5000 hz, respectively.
synthesis of tempo-tfp—n-(3-(4-amino-tempo)propyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenothiazine was synthesized by a two-step procedure.
2-(trifluoromethyl)phenothiazine (2.67 g, 10 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran
(10 ml) was added to a suspension of nah (0.48 g, 20 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran. the stirred suspension was heated to 50 °c for 1 h then
cooled to room temperature. 1,3-dibromopropane (1.22 ml, 12.0 mmol)
in tetrahydrofuran (5 ml) was then added over 10 min. the resulting
slurry was stirred at room temperature for 2 h. the reaction mixture
was filtered, and the filtrate concentrated in vacuo. the residue was
subjected to flash silica gel chromatography (2% ether/hexanes to 50%
ether/hexanes). after collection of the high rf n-allyl compound (1.0 g,
39%), the desired n-(3-bromopropyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenothiazine
(0.14 g, 3.6%) was obtained as a viscous oil. 1h nmr (cdcl3) d 2.25–
2.31 (m), 3.52 (t, j 5 9.0), 4.11 (t, j 5 6.5), 6.90 –7.25 (m).
the primary bromide was combined with 4-amino-tempo (25 mg,
0.15 mmol) and nahco3 (32 mg, 0.30 mmol) in n-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (2 ml). the mixture was established under nitrogen and heated at
100 °c for 1 h. after cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture
was partitioned between water and  xxxd2052xxx . the organic layer was
dried over  xxxd2534xxx  and concentrated in vacuo. the desired product was
isolated from the residue by flash silica gel chromatography (5% methanol/chloroform) to provide 35 mg (45%) of a red/brown oil. the fast
atom bombardment mass spectrum for this compound of 479.4 (mh1)
was consistent with that calculated for the desired product
(c25h31f3n3os, m 5 478.6). this product was taken on without further
characterization to the hydrobromide salt (hbr in acetic acid) which
was obtained as a solid from  xxxd2052xxx . an esr spectrum was
collected for the final bromide salt of n-(3-(4-amino-tempo)
propyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenothiazine.
drug solutions—stock solutions of each drug were prepared initially
before use.  xxxd318xxx  was prepared in a 80% d2o, 20% methanol-d4
solution and a stock solution of tfp was prepared in d20. tempo-tfp
was prepared in methanol-d4. the stock solutions of tfp that are light
sensitive were stored in the dark. for each drug titration, the sample
ph was adjusted when necessary. to reduce the  xxxd2738xxx  on the
spin-label, tempo-tfp, a 2-fold molar excess of  xxxd228xxx  was
added to the nmr sample.

results

drug and protein structures—in previous studies, we assigned the 10 methionyl methyl 1h-13c correlations (18) in
recombinant ctnc and used them as general markers to monitor ca21 and  xxxg2309xxx  binding to ctnc (23–25). the solution
structure of ctnc allows these assignments to be used as
positional markers for drug binding. fig. 1 shows the location
methionyl methyl carbons in a ribbon rendering of intact ctnc
(fig. 1a), and solvent accessible surfaces in the n-terminal
(fig. 1, b and c) and c-terminal (fig. 1d) domains. hydrophobic residues are shown in blue, all other residues are in white,
and the methionyl methyl groups are shown in red. fig. 1e
shows the structures of the compounds used in this study. both
 xxxd318xxx  and tfp have a positively charged nitrogen at ph 7.0.
the spin-labeled phenothiazine, which we will call tempotfp, was designed to mimic the primary structural features of
tfp including the intact phenothiazine rings and a positively
charged amine. synthesis of this compound is described under
“experimental procedures.”
effect of  xxxd318xxx  and tfp on ctnc—initial experiments
involved titration of [methyl-13c]met-labeled ctnc with  xxxd318xxx  or tfp to assign chemical shifts in the presence of the
drugs, and to identify similarities or differences in patterns of
chemical shift changes. unless otherwise indicated, all experiments were performed using recombinant ctnc( xxxd68xxx ) (17).
this protein has both cys-35 and -84 converted to ser to prevent formation of inter- and intramolecular disulfide bonds
during nmr analysis that can affect the hydrophobic surfaces
and functional characteristics of ctnc. ctnc( xxxd68xxx ) is active
and was used in determining the solution structure of ca21bound full-length ctnc (14). the methionyl methyl 1h-13c
correlations observed for free ctnc( xxxd68xxx ) in the presence
ca21 were essentially identical to those previously reported for
ctnc(c35s) (18).
the hsqc spectra in fig. 2, panel a, shows the effect of
 xxxd318xxx  on the methionyl methyl 1h-13c correlations in ctnc( xxxd68xxx ) in the absence of ca21. the addition of drug in molar
excess over protein resulted in small chemical shift changes for
all the met residues. the apparent binding constant for association of  xxxd318xxx  with 3ca21-ctnc is approximately 10 –20 mm
(4, 5). we do not attribute the small chemical shift changes
seen in fig. 2 to high affinity binding of  xxxd318xxx  to specific sites
since 1) equilibrium dialysis at lower drug and protein concentrations (200 mm of ctnc( xxxd68xxx )) showed no evidence of  xxxd318xxx  binding in the absence of ca21. equilibrium dialysis in the
presence of ca21 yielded an apparent binding constant of 20 mm
(data not shown); 2) we were unable to detect noes between
the n-terminal met methyl groups of ctnc( xxxd68xxx ) and protons
on the aromatic rings of  xxxd318xxx  in the absence of ca21 (see
below); and 3) the magnitude of drug-induced chemical shift
changes seen in the absence of ca21 were minor relative to
those observed in the presence of ca21 (see below). these data
suggest the minor chemical shift changes and line broadening
seen for the mets in the absence of ca21 are due to nonspecific
weak binding of the drug at mm concentrations used in the
nmr experiments.
fig. 2, panel b, shows that addition of  xxxd318xxx  to the 2ca21
form of ctnc( xxxd68xxx ), in which the high affinity ca21 binding
sites iii and iv are filled, induced large chemical shift changes
for met-120 and -157. minor changes in the chemical shifts for
n-terminal met residues are of a magnitude seen in the absence of ca21. this suggests that binding of the drug is restricted to the c-terminal domain when ca21 is bound only to
sites iii and iv.
fig. 3 and table i show chemical shift changes as the ca21bound ctnc( xxxd68xxx ) is titrated with  xxxd318xxx  (fig. 3, panels a

in the n-terminal domain (panels a and c) are shown separately from those in the c-terminal domain (panels b and d).
the initial peaks in the absence of drugs are shown in green,
whereas red indicates peaks at high concentration of drug. the
arrows point in the direction of chemical shift change as the
drug was added. the blue peaks correspond to intermediate
drug:protein ratios and are shown only for met-45 and -157,
which experience the greatest drug-induced change.
the data show that 1h chemical shift changes are observed
for all groups except met-137, which suggests binding sites in
both the n- and c-terminal domains. the drug binding sites for

both  xxxd318xxx  and tfp exhibit fast exchange characteristics
relative to the chemical shift time scale as evidenced by single
cross peaks in the hsqc spectra at a given drug:protein ratio,
and the fact that these changes are seen for all affected mets at
drug to protein ratios below 1:1. met-45 shows the greatest
drug-induced change at increasing  xxxd318xxx  or tfp concentrations. the resonance for met-45 broadens significantly at intermediate levels of drug, requiring a greater than 10-fold
lower contour level to observe this peak, but then sharpens
somewhat at saturating drug levels. this is indicative of intermediate exchange taking place for the methyl group of met-45
between the free and drug-bound states of ctnc( xxxd68xxx ), possibly due to a localized slow conformational transition.

ctnc appears more complex. although the major changes are
seen upon the addition of 3 equivalents of tfp, additional but
smaller changes in the 1h chemical shifts are induced upon the
addition of 4 and 6 equivalents of tfp. nevertheless, it is clear
that both  xxxd318xxx  and tfp induce similar patterns in chemical
shift changes and that the majority of these changes are
achieved at a drug to protein ratio of 3.
effect of tempo-tfp on met methyl chemical shifts—a
number of the mets reside in close proximity to the phe residues in the protein and could be affected by local ring current
fields. thus, the chemical shifts changes seen in fig. 3 and
table i could be attributed to either direct ring current effects
from tfp and  xxxd318xxx  or from a secondary effect resulting from
drug-induced protein conformational changes that alter the
positions of the met methyl groups relative to phe side chains.
the latter mechanism would be more likely for met residues
such as met-81 and -157, which are within ;3.4 å of the phe
ring, rather than met-45 and -60 which are no closer than ;6.5
å from the nearest phe ring.
to distinguish between direct and indirect effects of the
drugs, we chose two lines of experiments. the first involved the
use of a spin-labeled phenothiazine (tempo-tfp in fig. 1e),
the second uses 13c-filtered noesy nmr experiment to identify noes between drug and ctnc. the paramagnetic effect of
spin labels on chemical shift line widths is a low resolution
technique that can measure distances from between 10 and 15
å (26). we have used spin labels successfully in measuring
solvent exposure of met methyl groups as well as determining

central helix flexibility in ctnc when free or bound to  xxxg2309xxx  (23,
24). if the met methyl groups participate in the formation of the
drug binding sites, then tempo-tfp will result in line broadening of the 1h-13c correlations for those mets. thus, tempotfp is used here simply to identify which met side chains are
in the drug binding sites.
the hsqc spectra in fig. 5, panel a, compares the met
methyl chemical shifts of ca21-bound ctnc in the presence and
absence of reduced diamagnetic tempo-tfp at a probe-toprotein ratio of 0.8. the reduced compound should not affect
the chemical shift line width but should alter chemical shift
positions if it binds in a manner similar to tfp. indeed, tempo-tfp-induced chemical shift changes comparable in magnitude and nature to those induced by tfp at a similar probe to
protein ratio. fig. 5, panel b, shows the paramagnetic effect of
oxidized tempo-tfp on met methyl groups. all 1h-13c correlations are broadened beyond detection at this contour level
except that for met-137. these data demonstrate that: 1) the
paramagnetic effect of tempo-tfp is due to specific binding
since a nonspecific effect of the soluble compound would likely
result in broadening of all resonances including met-137; 2)
met-137, which is on the opposite side of the c-terminal domain relative to the c-terminal hydrophobic surface, is not
included in a drug binding site; and 3) all met methyl groups
except met-137 are within about 10 å from a bound drug.
tempo-tfp will prove very useful for subsequent studies of
drug binding sites on ctnc when associated with the  xxxg2309xxx  or
the intact troponin complex.
noes between  xxxd318xxx  and met methyl groups— xxxd318xxx 
was chosen for additional experiments designed to identify
noes between drug and met residues in 3ca21-ctnc. ctnc(acys) was labeled with both [methyl-13c]met and  xxxd2433xxx [d8] to
eliminate intraprotein noes between the met methyl groups
and phe side chains. isotope editing allowed the select observation of noes between the met methyl protons attached to
13
c and aromatic protons on  xxxd318xxx . control 1d spectra confirmed the efficiency of labeling with  xxxd2433xxx [d8] (data not
shown).
fig. 6 shows the spectra from the 13c-edited 2d noesy
experiment at drug:protein ratios of 1.5:1 (panels a, b, and c)
and 3.5:1 (panels d, e, and f). panels a and d show the 1h
dimension of the 2d 1h-13c hsqc, whereas panels b and e
show the 1h-13c hsqc that were used to assign and determine
the intensity of each resonance at the given drug concentration.
noes between the aromatic protons in  xxxd318xxx  and protons
attached to [methyl-13c]met are shown in panels c and f. at
the lower drug to protein ratio, strong noes are observed
between the 3,5 aromatic protons on the drug and the methionyl protons of met-60 and -80. weaker noes are detected
between the drug and the other met residues. due to resonance
overlap with met-81, the noe to met-45 cannot be observed,
however at a drug:protein ratio below 1 a noe to met-45 was
detected. at high drug:protein ratios, noes between  xxxd318xxx 
and met-60 and -80 persist, and noes between  xxxd318xxx  and
other met residues are strengthened in intensity. the noe at
1.89 ppm in panel c cannot be clearly assigned to met-103 or
-137 due to resonance overlap. however, we have tentatively
assigned this noe to met-103 since: 1) panel f shows no
apparent noe to met-137; 2) tempo-tfp has no effect on the
chemical shift of met-137; and 3) neither tfp nor  xxxd318xxx  have
a significant effect on the 1h chemical shift of met-137 (table
i). these filtered noes show that all methyl groups except 137
are likely within 5 å of aromatic rings in bound  xxxd318xxx  molecules and that the hydrophobic surface that includes met-60
and -80 appears to constitute a preferred binding site at lower
concentrations of drug.

discussion

the overall goal of the current study was to identify sites on
ctnc that can bind cardiotonic compounds and potentially
alter the ca21 binding affinity of site ii. we chose  xxxd318xxx  and
tfp as test compounds since previous reports show that they
bind to stnc (4, 5, 27) or stnc peptides (28 –30) and have clear
ca21-sensitizing effects on muscle preparations (4, 7, 9, 31, 32).
it was reasoned that identification of binding sites for these
compounds and the unique opportunity to correlate structural
drug binding data with the recent high resolution solution
structure of ctnc (14, 15) would implicate drug binding sites

that contribute to ca21 sensitization and provide a foundation
for the development of compounds that are specific for ctnc.
in a previous study, maclachlan et al. (5) reported binding of
one  xxxd318xxx  molecule to the n-terminal domain of ctnc. the
drug was proposed to make contact with met-81, and a model
for drug binding was presented based on tentative chemical
shift assignments and a structure for ca21-bound ctnc that
was based on the open conformation of stnc. in contrast to
maclachlan’s study, our data differ markedly in both the number and location of  xxxd318xxx  binding sites. differences in the
number of drug binding sites can be attributed to the experi-

in the absence (green peaks) or presence (red peaks) of 0.8 equivalents of reduced tempo-tfp. tempo-tfp was reduced with  xxxd228xxx  as
described under “experimental procedures.” panel b shows methyl 1h-13c correlations in the presence of 0.8 equivalents of oxidized tempo-tfp.
only met-137 is detected in the presence of the oxidized paramagnetic tempo-tfp. all spectra are shown at the same contour level.

 xxxd318xxx  and tfp binding sites on  xxxg2307xxx 

of  xxxd318xxx  binding to the hydrophobic surface seen in fig. 1b
shows that noes could be generated between one aromatic
ring in  xxxd318xxx  and met-47 and between the other aromatic
ring and met-81 and -85. in addition, stabilizing electrostatic
interactions could form between  xxxd318xxx  and glu-19. the other
binding site would include the hydrophobic patch seen in fig.
1c. the methyl group of met-60 is 5.5 and 7.5 å from those of
met-45 and -80, respectively, and the methyl groups of met-45
and -80 are separated by only a 3.5 å distance. thus a single
drug molecule bound to this site could generate noes with the
methyl groups of all three mets.
in a previous study we tested the functional consequence of
covalently coupling a 9 amino acid peptide to single cys residues in ctnc (16). these experiments were designed to mimic
the steric blocking effects of noncovalently bound drugs. our
general conclusion was that the n-terminal regulatory domain
had discrete hydrophobic surfaces with different functions. one
surface, which includes met-81, is important for activity since
blocking groups attached to cys at position 81 greatly inhibited
the activity of ctnc. this surface appears to interact with  xxxg2309xxx 
since position 81 can be readily cross-linked to  xxxg2309xxx  (16) and
since the methyl 1h-13c correlation of met-81 is significantly
affected by association of ctnc with  xxxg2309xxx  or  xxxg2309xxx  peptides (25).
in contrast, no significant functional effect was seen when
blocking groups were attached to cys at position 45, and the
methyl 1h-13c correlation of met-45 is not affected by  xxxg2309xxx .
together these data suggest that drugs that are noncovalently
bound to the region of met-81 would either be displaced by  xxxg2309xxx 
or that the nature of binding would be altered such that ctnc
activity is not inhibited. drug binding to a region that includes
met-45 as well as met-60 and -80 could persist in the presence
of  xxxg2309xxx  and not inhibit activity. drug binding to this site may
sensitize ctnc to ca21 since met-60 and -80 are in the helices
c and d of the regulatory ca21 binding site ii. this provides
potential structural basis for the  xxxd318xxx -induced decrease in
ca21 off rate at site ii (5, 6) and an attractive target against
which to direct ca21-sensitizing compounds.

mental conditions used in each study. at ph 7.0 used here,
 xxxd318xxx  is fairly soluble, whereas at a higher ph used in the
previous study,  xxxd318xxx  precipitates at drug:protein ratio of
greater than 1:1. differences in locations of bound  xxxd318xxx  can
be attributed to incorrect chemical shift assignments in the
previous study. met-81 was assigned a chemical shift of 2.15
ppm, whereas its correct assignment is 1.38 ppm. confidence in
the location of the drug binding sites reported here is based on
the unambiguous assignments of methionyl met chemical
shifts, and the use of heteronuclear nmr to clearly monitor
chemical shift changes and for the collection noe distance
constraints.
 xxxd318xxx  and tfp bind to ctnc only in the presence of ca21
with rapid exchange of drug between multiple binding sites in
the n- and c-terminal domains. the stoichiometry of binding
either drug was roughly the same, and the observed patterns of
met methyl chemical shift changes were remarkably similar for
both drugs. this suggests that  xxxd318xxx  and tfp bind similar
sites on ctnc. the c-terminal drug binding sites appear to be
restricted to the hydrophobic inside surface of a shallow cup
formed by the c-domain upon ca21 binding to sites iii and iv
(see fig. 1d). this surface includes side chains for met-103,
-120, and -157, but not -137. this conclusion is based on: 1) the
large chemical shift changes seen for the methyl groups of
met-120 and -157; 2) the paramagnetic effect of the oxidized
tempo-tfp on the methyl 1h-13c correlations for met-103,
-120, and -157, but not -137; and 3) observed noes between
 xxxd318xxx  and met-103, -120, and -157.
pan and johnson (33) recently showed that binding of emd
57033 to ctnc, required the high affinity sites iii and iv to
be occupied with ca21. thus, the hydrophobic surface in the
c-terminal domain of free ctnc appears to present binding
sites for calmodulin antagonists tfp and  xxxd318xxx  as well as
emd 57033. a pertinent question is whether binding of these
compounds to the c-terminal domain can affect the characteristics of ca21 binding to the n-terminal domain. intradomain communication in ctnc has been reported previously
(34). in addition, the ca21 binding affinity of site ii in ctnc
is increased by inactivation of sites iii and iv (35), whereas
the affinity of sites iii and iv in c-terminal fragments of both
ctnc (35) and stnc (36) are increased relative to the intact
protein. however, these observations should be interpreted
cautiously with respect to an interdomain effect of drugs in
the troponin complex. the  xxxg2309xxx  inhibitory peptide was shown
to shield met-120 and -157 from solvent (23), and association
of ctnc with  xxxg2309xxx  causes significant change in the met chemical shifts of met-120 and -157 (24, 25). this suggests that
association of  xxxg2309xxx  may displace compounds bound to the
c-terminal domain of ctnc.
drug binding to the n-terminal domain must be considered
with respect to the pattern of n-terminal hydrophobic surfaces,
distances between met methyl groups and noes between protons in  xxxd318xxx  and the methionyl methyl groups. fig. 1 shows
the n-terminal domain of ctnc to contain discrete hydrophobic
surfaces. one surface includes the side chains of met-47, -81,
and -85 (fig. 1b), whereas the other includes met-45, -60, and
-80 (fig. 1c). the methyl groups of met-47 and -60 are 16.7 å
apart and on different surfaces of the n-terminal domain.
thus, it seems unlikely that they could participate in the same
drug binding site. even if  xxxd318xxx  were to induce a separation
of helices a and b, to more fully open the n-terminal domain
and generate a contiguous hydrophobic surface, the methyl
groups of met-47 and -60 would be separated by about 17 å.
given these structural constraints and the fact that at least 3
mol of drug bind per mol of protein, it is more likely that the
n-terminal domain has multiple drug binding sites. modeling
