summary: racemic 2 agonists, composed of equal amounts of (r)- and (s)-isomers, can display anomalous
actions that compromise their effectiveness as asthma therapies. loss of efficacy during regular use is characteristic
of  xxxd2398xxx , albuterol and terbutaline and has in part been attributed to the biological effects of the (s)-isomer.
this hypothesis was applied to the (r,r)- and (s,s)-isomers of  xxxd2155xxx . (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  had 1000-times
greater affinity (2.9 nm) to the human 2 adrenoceptor than (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  (3100 nm), with receptor binding
modulating intracellular camp levels. the minimum lethal intravenous (iv) dose was determined to be 100 mg/
kg for (r,r)- and 50 mg/kg for (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx , suggesting that the toxicity of (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  may not be
related to the binding of 2 adrenoceptors. in tissues pretreated with (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  but not with (r,r)- or
racemic  xxxd2155xxx  contractions to high concentrations of carbachol were exaggerated. in vivo experiments
with sensitized guinea pigs demonstrated that (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  inhibited both histamine and antigen-induced
bronchoconstriction with greater potency than (r,r/s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  while (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  was ineffective. metabolic radiolabeling experiments of (r,r)-, (s,s)- or (r,r/s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  with crude human liver phenolsulfotransferase (pst) determined the vmax/km values to be (0.151), (0.74) and (0.143), respectively. the reciprocal
plot illustrates a 2-fold reduction in sulfation rate when (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  is present as a single isomer. the data
presented here suggest that (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  binds to the 2 adrenoceptor and inhibits the contraction of bronchial
tissues by spasmogens. however, (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  exhibits properties inconsistent as an asthma therapeutic and
may antagonize the actions of (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx .

than 3–4 hours so that it is necessary to use these drugs
regularly to achieve symptom control.2 to circumvent
this limitation, 2 selective agonists with a more protracted duration of action (e.g. salmeterol,  xxxd2155xxx )
have been introduced into asthma therapy.
except for levalbuterol, all  agonists that are used
in asthma therapy have been formulated as racemates
that comprise 50:50 mixtures of (r)- and (s)-, or (r,
r)- and (s,s)-isomers. implicit in this practice is a
presumption that (s)- or (s,s)-isomers of 2 agonists
are devoid of pharmacological activity. this viewpoint
is unwarranted, for it is well established that 2 agonist
isomers can exhibit divergent biological eﬀects. for

introduction
compounds that are 2 selective (e.g. albuterol, terbutaline,  xxxd2098xxx ) are widely used to provide acute
relief of airway obstruction in patients with asthma.
the therapeutic benefit in asthma is determined almost
exclusively by an interaction between the (r)-isomer
and the 2 adrenoceptor.1 however, the bronchoprotection aﬀorded by such drugs persists for less

instance, (s)-trimetoquinol, which does not bind to the
2 receptor, is a very potent inhibitor of thromboxane
synthetase3, and the (s)-isomers of  xxxd2398xxx  and
albuterol have proven to be at least as potent as
the corresponding (r)-isomers in reducing intraocular
pressure, with agonists and antagonists producing
similar eﬀects.4,5 it has become apparent that racemic
 agonists can produce eﬀects which reflect a net
pharmacological action of both isomers.6
for a bronchodilator therapy, the ability to evoke
hyperreactivity in intact airways is a property that is
common to (s)-isomers of  xxxd2398xxx , albuterol and
terbutaline.7,8 this distinctive property of the distomers
does not arise from either activation or desensitization
of 2 adrenoceptors9,10 but may relate to ca2+ ion movement into airway cells following an opening of voltagesensitive calcium channels.11,12 studies have shown that
(s)-albuterol can enhance human bronchial responses
to spasmogens13 and eosinophil reactivity in vitro.14,15
diﬀerences in the biological properties of  xxxd2155xxx 
isomers have also been observed suggesting contradictory pharmacological actions. although neither
(r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  nor (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  stimulated mucin secretion in airway explant and dissociated epithelial cell cultures,16 other dissimilarities in biological
assays were found. (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  reduced levels of
the inflammatory cytokine, gm-csf (granulocytemacrophage-colony stimulating factor) to >40% of the
control in human airway smooth muscle cells.17 (s,s) xxxd2155xxx  instead increased production of gm-csf.17
both (r,r)- and (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  increased expression
of the collagen gene col iii1 in human pulmonary
fibroblasts, however, the increase was much more pronounced for (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  (265.3±12.2% over
vehicle) than for (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  (152.8±15.8%).18
in mice, 30 g/kg of (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  given twice a
day for 2 weeks, eﬀectively decreased responsiveness to
both early and late allergic responses and significantly
attenuated airway hyperresponsiveness to  xxxd2586xxx .19 in 126 cells which over-express the 2 adrenoceptor, (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  induced the loss of
surface receptors at a rate and extent similar to epinephrine. (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  instead, caused a 10% increase in cell surface receptor binding suggesting that
it is an  xxxd1422xxx  at the 2 adrenoceptor site.20
against this background, properties of constituent
isomers [(r,r)- and (s,s)-], diastereoisomers [(r,s)- and
(s,r)-] and of racemic [(r,r/s,s)-] forms of  xxxd2155xxx 
have been compared using a range of test systems.
materials and methods
chemical synthesis of  xxxd2155xxx 
 xxxd2155xxx  and its isomers were obtained from sepracor inc. (marlborough, ma, usa). the synthesis

is detailed below. all other reagents of the highest
possible quality were obtained from sigma, fluka
a.g. buchs-switzerland, gibco brl-life sciences
and fischer scientific.
(r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  tartrate
optically pure (r)-2-bromo-(4′-benzyloxy-3′-formamidophenyl)ethanol ((r)-fbh3) was prepared from
commercially available 2-bromo-4′-benzyloxy-3′nitro-acetophenone (fbk).21 the fbk was reduced
to provide (r)-2-bromo-(4′-benzyloxy-3′-nitrophenyl)
ethanol ((r)-fbh) via enantioselective borane reduction using 5 mol% (1r, 2s)-aminoindanol-derived
oxazaborolidine as the chiral source. (r)-fbh was
reduced using 5%  xxxd2923xxx . the resultant aniline,
(r)-2-bromo-(4′-benzyloxy-3′-aminophenyl) ethanol
((r)- xxxg921xxx ), was formulated to give the optically pure
formamido-bromohydrin (r)-fbh3 (>99% ee).
(r)-fbh3 was reacted with optically pure (r)-nbenzyl-2-amino-(4-methoxyphenyl) propane mandelic
acid salt ((r)-fba-l-ma) in the presence of k2co3
to give (r,r)-dibenzylformoterol ((r,r)-dbf).
the optically pure (r)-n-benzyl-2-amino-(4methoxyphenyl) propane mandelic acid salt (fba-lma) is prepared by reductive amination of commercially available 4-methoxyphenylacetone followed
by resolution with l-mandelic acid in methanol. (r,
r)-dbf was directly converted to (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx 
((r,r)-fm) by catalytic hydrogenation (pd-c, h2).
the crude (r,r)-fm acid salt was crystallized to give
the final drug substance in 35% yield from (r)-fbh
(99.6% cp, >99% ee).
(s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  tartrate
in a manner analogous to the preparation of (r,
r)- xxxd2155xxx  tartrate, (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  tartrate was
prepared from optically pure (s)-2-bromo-(4′-benzyloxy-3′-formamido-phenyl)ethanol ((s)-fbh3) and
(s)-n-benzyl-2-amino-(4-methoxyphenyl)propane
mandelic acid salt ((s)-fba-l-ma). (s)-fbh3 (>99%
ee) was prepared from (s)-2-bromo-(4′-benzyloxy-3′nitrophenyl) ethanol ((s)-fbh) via enantioselective
borane reduction using 5 mol% (1s, 2r)-aminoindanol-derived oxazaborolidine, followed by reduction with 5%  xxxd2923xxx /h2, and formylation.
(s)-fbh3 and (s)-fba-l-ma were taken forward as
above to give (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  acid salt (99.5% cp,
>99% ee).
(r,s)- xxxd2155xxx  tartrate
in a manner analogous to the preparation of (r,
r)- xxxd2155xxx  tartrate, (r,s)- xxxd2155xxx  tartrate was
prepared from optically pure (r)-2-bromo-(4′-benzyloxy-3′-formamidophenyl) ethanol ((r)-fbh3) and

mgcl2 and 0.5 mm  xxxd228xxx . samples were incubated (60 min at 22°c) and filtered on gf/c glass
fiber filters in a brandel cell harvester. filters were
washed 4 times with ice cold aliquots (5 ml) of buﬀer
(25 mm tris-hcl buﬀer containing 2 mm mgcl2;
ph 7.5) and counted by gamma spectrometry. sample
number (n) was between 2 and 5, depending on preparation.

beas 2b cells were grown to confluence on 12well plates. after washing with pbs, either (r,s) xxxd2398xxx , (r,r)-, (s,s)-, (s,r)-, (r,s)-, (r,r/s,s) xxxd2155xxx  (all at 100-fold of the kd concentration)
or vehicle (pbs, containing 300 m  xxxd228xxx  and
1 m ro-20-1724, a potent inhibitor of  xxxg1700xxx  isoenzymes) were added to the cells in
fixed volumes. after incubating at 37°c for 30 min,
media were aspirated and replaced by ice-cold ethanol
(500 l). after 1 h at 22°c, the aliquot of ethanol was
lyophilized and reconstituted using water (500 l).
samples were assayed by immunoassay and camp
concentrations estimated by interpolation.

in a manner analogous to the preparation of (r,
r)- xxxd2155xxx  tartrate, (s,r)- xxxd2155xxx  tartrate was
prepared from optically pure (s)-2-bromo-(4′-benzyloxy-3′-formamidophenyl)ethanol ((s)-fbh3) and
(r)-n-benzyl-2-amino-(4-methoxyphenyl)propane
mandelic acid salt ((r)-fba-l-ma). (s)-fbh3
(>99% ee) was prepared from (s)-2-bromo-(4′-benzyloxy-3′-nitrophenyl) ethanol ((s)-fbh) via enantioselective borane reduction using 5 mol% (1s,
2r)-aminoindanol-derived oxazaborolidine, followed
by reduction with 5%  xxxd2923xxx /h2, and formylation. (s)-fbh3 and (r)-fba-l-ma were taken
forward as above to give (s,r)- xxxd2155xxx  acid salt
(99.3% cp, >99% ee).
preparation of  adrenoceptors
wildtype spodoptera frugiperda (sf9) cells (american
type culture collection, rockville, md, usa) were
cultured in spinner flasks (80 rpm at 27°c) using
tnm-fh medium containing fetal bovine serum
(10%),  xxxd164xxx  (2.5 g/ml), streptomycin (50 g/ml)
and penicillin (50 g/ml). recombinant baculoviruses
containing the cdna encoding human 1 adrenoceptor or 2 adrenoceptor were used to infect sf9
cells. two days later, cells were isolated by centrifugation (1000 g, 20 min), washed with phosphate
buﬀered saline (pbs) at 0°c and lysed in 50 mm
tris-hcl buﬀer containing 5 mm edta, 20 g/ml
aprotinin and 20 g/ml  xxxd302xxx ; ph 7.5) at 0°c,
using a brinkmann polytron (2×20 s). the homogenate was centrifuged (40 000 g, 20 min) and the
pellet washed and resuspended in buﬀer (circa 20 pmol
 adrenoceptor/ml).

acute oral and iv toxicity studies
(r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  tartrate and (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  tartrate were prepared in 0.25% aqueous  xxxd2609xxx 
and administered to 3 rats/sex/group once by oral
gavage. each article was tested at a single dosage of
1000 mg/kg. the rats were approximately 7 weeks
old and weighed between 144 and 197 grams at the
beginning of the study. animals were observed for 14
days after dosing. parameters evaluated included daily
clinical signs, weekly body weights and macroscopic
examination at necropsy. (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  tartrate
and (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  tartrate were prepared in sterile
saline and administered to 3 rats/sex/group once by
intravenous injection. (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  was tested at
10, 50, 75 and 100 mg/kg, and the (s,s)-isomer was
tested  xxxd1891xxx , 50 and 75 mg/kg. the rats were 6–9
weeks old and weighed between 168 and 300 g at the
beginning of the study. animals were observed for 14
days after dosing. parameters evaluated included daily
clinical signs, weekly body weights and macroscopic
examination at necropsy.

radioligand binding concentrations
human 1 or 2 adrenoceptor binding was estimated
using [125i] iodopindolol (2200 ci/mmol, new england
nuclear, boston, ma, usa). sf9 membranes (22 fmol
of 1 adrenoceptor or 2 adrenoceptor), 41–51 pm
[125i] iodopindolol, as well as competing ligands in
increasing concentrations (10−9–10−3 m) were suspended in 25 mm tris-hcl at ph 7.5, containing 2 mm

in vitro spasmolysis of airway smooth muscle
male dunkin hartley guinea pigs were sensitized by
one dose of 10 g of ovalbumin/100 mg of al(oh)3
as adjuvant administered interperitoneally.22 after 14
days the animals developed dermal hypersensitivity
to ovalbumin. sensitized animals were sacrificed with
a blow to the neck and exsanguinated. tracheae were

excised, dissected free of connective tissue, cut into
ring segments (approximately 3 mm in length) and
suspended in aerated (95% o2; 5% co2) krebs–
henseleit solution within an organ bath. isometric
tension was measured with a grass ft.03 force transducer and a grass polygraph (model 7). tracheal
tissues were equilibrated under a load of 1 g for 1 h
with regular washing then contracted with carbachol
in increasing concentrations. they were then washed
and incubated with fixed concentrations of (r,r)-,
(s,s)-, (r,r/s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  or saline for 90 min followed by a wash, a 90 min washout period, and then
re-contracted with increasing doses of carbachol. for
estimation of pd2 values, separate experiments were
conducted. tracheal tissues were equilibrated as above
and contracted with a fixed dose of histamine, carbachol or ovalbumin and relaxed with increasing doses
of (r,r)-, (s,s)- or (r,r/s,s)- xxxd2155xxx .

allowed to equilibrate for 30 min and succinylcholine
(1 mg/kg s.c.) was administered to suppress spontaneous ventilation. blood pressure and heart rate
measurements were taken at 5 min intervals for 15 min
to obtain baseline values. once obtained, a single dose
of test compound or vehicle was administered (0.5 mg/
kg, n=6) and changes in heart rate and mean blood
temperature were measured at 5 min intervals for a
minimum of 15 min or until stable values had been
obtained. the animals were then treated with histamine (4 g/kg) and the maximum increase in airway
pressure, mean blood pressure and heart rate reassessed. once measurements had stabilized, two additional histamine treatments were given at 5 min
intervals. after histamine treatments, guinea pigs were
challenged with ovalbumin (0.3 mg/kg) and changes in
all measurements were assessed. mean blood pressure
was measured as [(systolic blood pressure−diastolic
blood pressure)×0.33]+diastolic blood pressure.

in vivo pulmonary function
when determining the acute protective eﬀects of (r,
r)-, (s,s)- and (r,r/s,s)- xxxd2155xxx , inflation pressure was used to define changed airway resistance.
guinea-pigs were anesthetized with intraperitoneal
sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg) and ventilated using
room air (2.5–4.5 ml, 0.75–0.9 hz). inflation pressure
was measured using a pressure transducer which was
attached to a side arm of the tracheal cannula.23
after 30 min, succinylcholine (1 mg/kg) was injected
subcutaneously. fifteen minutes later, the pressure
range of the respiratory cycle was recorded at regular
(5 min) intervals to allow estimation of basal resistance
to inflation. test materials were injected intravenously
no less than 15 min before i.v. injection of histamine
(4 g/kg) or antigen (0.3 mg ovalbumin/kg). airway
resistance was measured before, and after, injection
of histamine or antigen to determine the ability of each
compound, or vehicle to inhibit airway contractions.
airway pressure has been expressed as the diﬀerence
between the maximum and minimum pressure observed during each respiratory cycle.
cardiovascular studies
guinea pigs were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg interperitoneally) and tracheas
were cannulated for artificial ventilation with room
air at a rate of 45–55 breaths per minute with a tidal
volume of roughly 2.5–4.5 ml. a tracheal cannula
side arm was connected to a pressure transducer for
measuring airway pressure. a carotid artery catheter
was advanced into the thoracic aorta to measure blood
pressure and heart rate. a jugular vein catheter was
advanced into the superior vena cava and used to
administer test compounds, vehicle, histamine or ovalbumin. following preparation, the animals were

metabolic studies
hepatic 100,000 g cytosol (n=6) was prepared by
homogenization and diﬀerential centrifugation. the
m and p forms of pst were partially purified from
the cytosol by ion exchange chromatography on a
deae-sepharose column as previously described.24
pst fractions (1–2 g) were incubated for 30 min at
37°c in 33 mm tris buﬀer (ph 7.4) with 0.4 m 3′phosphoadenosine-5′- xxxd1564xxx  (pap35s- new
england nuclear), 9 mm dithiothreitol, 0.0625% bsa
and  xxxd2155xxx  isomers [(r,r), (s,s) and (r,r/s,s)].
the accumulated radiolabeled sulphate conjugates
were determined by reversed phase hplc and scintillation counting of peaks. mass spectroscopy analysis of individual peaks allowed identification of the
fragments, which represent  xxxd2155xxx  sulfate.
data analysis and calculation of pd2 values
all values are expressed as the mean±se. statistical
analysis of the data was carried out using the onetailed students t-test. anova was used for statistical
analysis of changes in in vivo airway pressure with
air pressure as the dependent variable and drug treatment as the independent variable. the pd2 values were
estimated from the concentration–response curves by
means of nonlinear regression analysis of the experimental data.

was used to define binding aﬃnities for isomers [(r,
r)-, (s,s)-] and diastereoisomers [(r,s)-, (s,r)-] of
 xxxd2155xxx  as well as for the racemate [(r,r/s,s)-].
the rank order of aﬃnities for 2 adrenoceptors [(r,
r)->(r,r/s,s)->(s,r)->(r,s)->>(s,s)- xxxd2155xxx ]
diﬀered from the rank order of aﬃnities for 1 adrenoceptors [(r,r)->(r,s)->(r,r/s,s)->(s,r)->>(s,
s)- xxxd2155xxx ] (table 1). for racemic  xxxd2155xxx ,
binding to 2 receptors was more selective than was
binding to 1 receptors. this 37-fold diﬀerence in
aﬃnity can largely be accounted for by actions of (r,
r)- xxxd2155xxx , which exhibited a selectivity of 39-fold
as compared with the 2.2-fold selectivity of (s,s) xxxd2155xxx .
intrinsic activities of  xxxd2155xxx  isomers were assessed by determining the maximal accumulation of
camp that resulted from exposure of cultured human
bronchial epithelial cells to a high dose (100×kd) of
each isomer. (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  (1.02) had an intrinsic
activity that corresponded closely to that of (r) xxxd2401xxx  (1.00; 65±7 pmole/well) whereas intrinsic activities of (s,r)- xxxd2155xxx  (0.91), (r,s)- xxxd2155xxx  (0.65) and (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  (0.18) were
reduced (table 1).
parallel studies gave no indication of binding by
(r,r)-, (s,s)- or (r,r/s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  at concentrations up to 3 m to the following: cloned human
3 adrenoceptors, b2 bradykinin, neurokinin (nk1,
 xxxg2240xxx ),  xxxd2973xxx  (paf), atp-sensitive
k+ channel, pgh2, ca2+ channel, and muscarinic
(m1, m2, m3) receptors (data not shown).
acute oral and iv toxicity studies
there were no deaths in the oral toxicity study, and
body weight gains and macroscopic findings were
normal. clinical signs were minimal, non-specific and
limited to females. for (r,r)-  xxxd2155xxx , observations included abnormal stance/gait, bright yellow urine, and poor grooming. in addition, the (r,
r)- xxxd2155xxx  group exhibited decreased activity,
quivering, squinting, and decreased muscle tone. in
the (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  group, findings were limited to

bright yellow urine. clinical signs generally resolved
within 2–4 days (data not shown).
deaths associated with intravenous administration
of (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  were limited to the 100 mg/kg
group (all 6 animals). however, following administration of the (s,s)-isomer, 4 of 6 rats died and
5 of 6 died after doses of 50 mg/kg and 75 mg/kg,
respectively. all deaths occurred during or shortly
after dosing (<30 min). clinical signs for the 50 and
75 mg/kg (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  groups included labored
respiration, body drop, quivering, abnormal stance/
gait, and decreased activity. for the (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx 
group, clinical signs for the 50 and 75 mg/kg groups
included labored respiration, body drop, abnormal
stance/gait, decreased activity, prostration, tremors,
vocalizations, and (at 75 mg/kg) convulsions. there
were no apparent diﬀerences in the frequencies of
deaths or clinical signs between the sexes. all surviving
animals appeared normal the day after dosing, with
body weights and gross findings at necropsy all regarded as unremarkable.
effects on isolated airway smooth muscle
in isolated guinea-pig tracheal strips that had been
precontracted with histamine, addition of (r,r)-, (s,
s)- or (r,r/s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  (0.01–1000 nm) produced
dose-related relaxation, with a rank order of: (r,r)>(r,r/s,s)->>(s,s)- xxxd2155xxx 
with
(r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  exhibiting a 640-fold greater potency over (s,
s)- xxxd2155xxx .
relaxant eﬀects of (r,r)-, (s,s)- or (r,r/s,s) xxxd2155xxx  (0.01–1000 nm) were also defined using
tracheal smooth muscle strips from animals sensitized

values were calculated from dose-response curves (not shown here).

pigs with (s)-albuterol could significantly augment
contractile responses to acetylcholine.25 hence, following definition of a dose-eﬀect relationship for carbachol, tracheal strips from sensitized animals were
preincubated with either saline, (r,r/s,s)-, (r,r)-,
or (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  (10−7 ) for 90 min and, after
thorough washing for 90 min, responses to increasing
concentrations of carbachol (10−8 to 10−6 ) were
determined. a significant reduction of contractile responses to lower concentrations of carbachol were
observed following preincubation with (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  (indicating tissue retention), but not following
preincubation with (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  or (r,r/s,s)- xxxd2155xxx . in tissues preincubated with (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx , not only was such inhibition not observed,

but responses to higher concentrations of carbachol
were enhanced to a significant extent (fig. 1a–d).
effects on airway smooth muscle in vivo
diﬀerences between responses of sensitized and nonsensitized tissues prompted a comparison of the eﬀects
of racemic  xxxd2155xxx  and its isomers upon intact
airways in sensitized and normal animals. sub-maximal bronchoconstrictor responses of guinea pig airways were induced in anaesthetized animals by use of
intravenous bolus injections of histamine (4 g/kg).
intravenous injection of (r,r/s,s)- xxxd2155xxx 
(ed50=1.6 nmole/kg) or of (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  (ed50=
1.0 nmole/kg) produced dose-related inhibition

biological properties of the isomers of  xxxd2155xxx 

whereas (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  was statistically ineﬀective
at doses up to 200 nmole/kg (fig. 2a). the rank order
of relative potencies: (r,r)->(r,r/s,s)->>(s,s)- xxxd2155xxx , was consistent with relaxant eﬀects being
determined by occupancy of 2 adrenoceptors. as
these animals had been sensitized to ovalbumin (18–21
days before study), intravenous injection of ovalbumin
(0.3 mg/kg) was used to define eﬃcacy of  xxxd2155xxx 
diastereoisomers as inhibitors of allergic bronchospasm. (r,r/s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  (ed50=54 nmole/kg)
or (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  (ed50=40 nmole/kg) produced
dose-related inhibition, whereas (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  was
only eﬀective at the highest dose (200 nmole/kg) when
inhibition did not exceed 48% (fig. 2b) and did not
diﬀer statistically from the air pressure lowering eﬀects
of the racemic drug and (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx . (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  at 115 nmole/kg was statistically ineﬀective
at lowering airway pressure (p=0.01).

cardiovascular effects
both (r,r)- and (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  decreased systemic
blood pressure in guinea pigs, but only when doses
considerably exceeded those that were needed to eﬀect
bronchodilation. for instance, (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx 
(115 nmole/kg) reduced mean arterial pressure from
54±6 mm hg to 45±2 mm hg, whereas (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  (115 nmole/kg) was without hypotensive activity. although, (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  did not aﬀect heart
rate at the doses tested, there were episodes of profound hypotension (3/6, 20 nmole/kg group; 5/6,
115 nmole/kg group; 1/6, 200 nmole/kg group) in all
treatment groups after antigen administration (data
not shown).

metabolic studies
in order to determine whether  xxxd2155xxx  is metabolized by sulfate conjugation, human hepatoma cells
were cultured in the presence of (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  and
na235so4. separation of the constituents of the culture
medium by reversed phase hplc produced a major
peak with a retention time of 12 min.26 the ms spectrum of this peak revealed an (m+na)+ ion of m/z
447, consistent with incorporation of sulfate, especially as there was also an ion of m/z 367, as would
be anticipated following removal of so3− (80 amu).
in studies shown here, sulfation of racemic  xxxd2155xxx 
and its isomers was measured in preparations from six
human livers, as incorporation of 35s from preformed
pap35skm, and values for vmax have been calculated
from measurement of the velocity of sulfation (fig.
3). the vmax/km for (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  (0.074) was
significantly lower than that for (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx 
(0.143) and (r,r/s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  (0.151).

discussion
the use of radio-ligand binding experiments has revealed that the capacity of (r,r/s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  to
activate human adrenoceptors is selective for 2 adrenoceptors and is determined predominantly by (r,
r)- xxxd2155xxx , which also induced 2 adrenoceptor
internalization in 126 cells.20 this conclusion has
been reinforced by measurement of camp in human
bronchial epithelial cells, which demonstrated that
(r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  largely accounts for the intrinsic
activity of (r,r/s,s)- xxxd2155xxx . a eudismic ratio
(activity of (r,r)- over (s,s)-) exceeding 600 for 2
adrenoceptor binding suggests that (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx 
may account exclusively for activation of 2 adrenoceptors by (r,r/s,s)- xxxd2155xxx .
by way of contrast, toxicology studies examining
the eﬀects of (r,r)- and (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  showed that
the minimum lethal intravenous dose of the (s,s)isomer was comparable with that of the (r,r)-isomer.
by the oral route, no lethal dose could be determined
for either isomer, implying that there is limited oral
bioavailability of this drug which could explain the
limited success of racemic  xxxd2155xxx  as an oral
asthma therapeutic.27 significantly, the present studies
imply that the (s,s)-isomer may achieve toxicity that
is comparable to those of the (r,r)-isomer by virtue
of eﬀects that do not arise from binding to  adrenergic
receptors. this observation is not without precendent
since it has recently been shown that the anabolic
eﬀects of clenbuterol upon skeletal muscle are shared
equally by both isomers even though the 2 adrenoceptor activation resides exclusively with the (r)isomer.28,29 stimulation of collagen secretion by (s,s) xxxd2155xxx  (which was not blocked by atropine)18 as
well as the observed increase of gm-csf cytokine17
and airway hyperresponsiveness to  xxxd2586xxx  in
mice19 suggests that (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  may actually
intensify the bronchoconstrictor response of asthmatic
airways and contribute to airway remodeling through
repeated use.
on the basis of studies of isomer actions upon
isolated smooth muscle, it has previously been proposed that (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  is almost exclusively responsible for spasmolytic actions of (r,r/s,s) xxxd2155xxx  with the corollary that (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx 
was eﬀectively inert.30,31 although the chemical purity
of (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  exceeds 99%, traces of (r,r) xxxd2155xxx  will contribute to the relaxant responses
to high concentrations of (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx . it may be
concluded that (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  has 1/10th to 1/30th
the spasmolytic activity of (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  even
though (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  has 1000-fold greater binding aﬃnity for the 2 receptor and, when present in
a racemic mixture, the (s,s)-isomer decreases the
overall relaxation eﬀect of the drug. this may occur

burke) plots of the mean values are displayed in the right hand panel. n=6.

through an increase in contractility as previously demonstrated with (s)-albuterol.25
metabolic labeling studies in human liver cytosol
preparations suggest that the sulfation of  xxxd2155xxx 
is enantioselective, as already observed with the isomers of albuterol.26,32 however, unlike (r)-albuterol,
which is metabolized more quickly that (s)-albuterol,
(s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  is metabolized more quickly than the
(r,r)-isomer. recent studies have demonstrated a
similar enantioselective metabolic scheme for  xxxd2155xxx  glucuronidation in human liver microsomes.33
moreover, (r,r/s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  was shown to be
sulfated more slowly than either of the individual
isomers, implying a retarded clearance from plasma
when the (r,r)-isomer is present as a single isomer.
interest in the use of single isomer 2 selective
agonists in asthma therapy arises because such compounds may avoid the anomalous eﬀects that characterize racemic  agonists. a need to consider the

clinical significance of these anomalous eﬀects arose
when it was recognized that children who died in an
epidemic of asthma death were found to have used
>8 mg of inhaled agonist in the last 24 h of life.34,35
more recently, paradoxical eﬀects have also been
observed following regular use of racemic albuterol,
terbutaline and  xxxd2098xxx , suggesting that agonists
which are 2 selective share this undesirable profile.36
whether such properties are shared also by 2 selective
agonists that have more prolonged eﬀects has yet to
be established. however, initial findings are consistent
with such a profile since protection is diminished
following regular use of racemic salmeterol37 or
racemic  xxxd2155xxx .38 it is widely presumed that such
loss of protection is secondary to desensitization of
2 adrenoceptors. however, desensitization does not
fully account for changed responsivity39 and induction
of hyperreactivity by (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  provides an
alternative explanation for loss of protection. this

conclusion is supported by the recent finding that the
pro-inflammatory eﬀects reported for other  agonists
distomers are also elicited by (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx .40
it may be concluded that (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  accounts
for the therapeutic benefits of racemic  xxxd2155xxx ,
including adrenoceptor binding, elevation of intracellular camp levels, bronchodilatory and bronchoprotective eﬀects, as demonstrated by the studies
presented here. the isomers of  xxxd2155xxx  are metabolized via an enantioselective cellular mechanism.
toxicology studies indicate that the (s,s)-isomer is
toxic in a manner independent of 2 adrenoceptor
binding and may increase the toxicological burden of
the racemic drug. hence, the use of (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx 
for asthma treatment would eliminate any adverse
eﬀects of (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  that arise during therapeutic use of racemic  xxxd2155xxx .
