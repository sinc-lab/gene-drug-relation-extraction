creatine (cr) levels in skeletal muscle and brain of a mouse model of
cr deficiency caused by  xxxd2244xxx  methyltransferase absence
( xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺) were studied after cr supplementation with 2 g 䡠 kg body
wt⫺1 䡠 day⫺1 cr for 35 days. localized 1h magnetic resonance spectroscopy (mrs) was performed in brain (cerebellum and thalamus/
hippocampus) and in hind leg muscle of  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice before and
after cr supplementation and in control (con) mice. as expected, a
signal for cr was hardly detectable in mr spectra of  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice
before cr supplementation. in the thalamus/hippocampus region of
these mice, an increase in n-acetylasparate (naa) was observed.
during cr administration, cr levels increased faster in skeletal muscle
compared with brain, but this occurred only during the first day of
supplementation. thereafter, cr levels increased by 0.8 mm/day in all
studied locations. after 35 days of cr supplementation, cr levels in all
locations were higher compared with con mice on a cr-free diet and
naa levels normalized. only because of the repeated mrs measurements performed in this longitudinal cr supplementation study on
 xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice were we able to discover the initial faster uptake of
cr in skeletal muscle compared with brain, which may represent
muscular cr uptake independent of cr transporter expression. our
results can provide the basis for additional experiments to optimize cr
supplementation in  xxxg858xxx  deficiency, as increases in brain cr are
slow in patients after cr supplementation.
energy metabolism;  xxxg2153xxx ; 1h magnetic resonance spectroscopy

( xxxg858xxx ) deficiency is
an autosomal recessive disorder described for the first time as
a new inborn error of metabolism over a decade ago (40). its
incidence is unknown (⬃30 patients have been described so
far), and it is probable that many patients remain undiagnosed
(21).  xxxg858xxx  is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of creatine
(cr), an important molecule in energy metabolism of highly
excitable tissues such as skeletal muscle and brain. deficiency
in  xxxg858xxx  leads to severe clinical symptoms, including mental
retardation, muscle hypotonia, extrapyramidal movement abnormalities, and epileptic seizures (43). these symptoms highlight the importance of intact cr metabolism in humans.

magnetic resonance spectroscopy (mrs) allows noninvasive assessment of various compounds central in the study of
energy metabolism, and localized mrs has played an important role in the elucidation of the pathophysiology of  xxxg858xxx 
deficiency. localized 1h mrs of the brain of patients showed
a strongly reduced cr signal along with a broad new signal
at 3.8 ppm (e.g., ref. 40), probably arising from  xxxd2244xxx  (gua), the immediate precursor of cr in the
biosynthesis. 31p mrs of brain and skeletal muscle showed a
strong reduction in phosphorylated cr (pcr) along with a high
signal of phosphorylated gua (pgua; e.g., refs. 8, 32, 40).
therapeutic approaches to alleviate symptoms in  xxxg858xxx 
deficiency include cr supplementation, as uptake of cr from
the blood can result in increases in cr concentration in several
tissues such as skeletal muscle and brain (44). the biosynthesis
of cr is assumed to take place mainly in the pancreas and liver,
and cr is exported to the blood and taken up in cr-requiring
tissues by a cr transporter (crt) against a large concentration
gradient (44). the presence of biosynthetic enzymes in both
brain (1, 2, 24, 41) and skeletal muscle (2, 6, 31), however,
suggests that these organs can, at least partly, synthesize their
own cr.
cr supplementation in  xxxg858xxx -deficient patients leads to
partial improvement of clinical symptoms, and 1h mrs studies of the brain of  xxxg858xxx -deficient patients revealed that the
increase in cr concentration during long-term cr supplementation is slow and still not complete after 2 yr (39). methods to
increase the rate of uptake of cr in the brain in  xxxg858xxx 
deficiency could therefore be beneficial for a more rapid
decrease of symptoms. recently, neonatal supplementation of
cr has been suggested to prevent the development of clinical
symptoms in  xxxg858xxx  deficiency (35). however, as the majority
of cases of  xxxg858xxx  deficiency is diagnosed after the neonatal
period, a rapid increase in cr could possibly prevent the
development of severe clinical symptoms in young patients.
high gua concentrations in brain could play a role in both
the incomplete improvement of the clinical symptoms (33) and
the slow uptake of cr in brain due to competitive binding to the
crt at the blood-brain barrier (25). furthermore, the low
permeability of the blood-brain barrier for cr could also play a
role (1). strategies to improve clinical symptoms by restricting
arginine and supplementing ornithine to reduce gua concentrations led to a further improvement of clinical symptoms, but
there was still no complete normalization (33). this same

cr supplementation in  xxxg858xxx -deficient mice

strategy led to a faster increase in cr concentration in skeletal
muscle of a  xxxg858xxx -deficient patient compared with brain,
resulting in complete normalization of the cr concentration in
skeletal muscle within 3 mo (8).
as a model for the  xxxg858xxx  deficiency in humans, gamtdeficient knockout mice ( xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺) were generated (31) that
completely lack the essential enzyme  xxxg858xxx  and thus cannot
form cr. our earlier studies on these mice validated their use
as an animal model for  xxxg858xxx  deficiency (30, 31) and showed
that, like patients, they accumulate gua, the immediate precursor of cr. detailed studies on skeletal muscle revealed that the
mice show hypotonia and that they can reversibly phosphorylate and use gua as a substitute for pcr under mild metabolic
demands. short-term cr supplementation relieved some but not
all of the differences observed compared with control animals
in skeletal muscle (17, 18).
a detailed study of increases in cr during cr supplementation in patients in various tissues is not available. a study in
 xxxg858xxx -deficient patients would require considerable resources
and organization as  xxxg858xxx  deficiency is rare and the level of
mental retardation of patients requires sedation for mrs acquisition.  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, in contrast, provide an unique
opportunity to study cr increases in several tissues in a controlled manner. localized 1h mrs enables simple longitudinal
assessment of cr increases in various tissues. therefore, in
the present study, we studied by 1h mrs the increases in
cr concentration in skeletal muscle and brain during long-term
cr supplementation. it was hypothesized that the increase in cr
concentration in brain would be slower than in skeletal muscle.
our results could elucidate the differences in cr uptake observed between skeletal muscle and brain as well as provide
clues for therapeutic improvements to cr uptake in brain.
materials and methods

animals. adult male and female  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice (⬎6 mo old),
generated by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells
(31), and homozygous and heterozygous wild-type (con) littermates
of the  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ animals were measured in this study (31). animals
were given free access to standard chow based on vegetable protein to
eliminate possible cr content (ssniff spezialdiäten, soest, germany).
animals were housed according to phenotype for at least 3 mo before
the start of the study to prevent cr intake resulting from coprophagia
from control animals (18).
after a baseline mr measurement, all  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice were supplemented for 35 days with 2 g䡠kg body wt⫺1 䡠day⫺1 cr monohydrate
(sigma c0780) dissolved in the drinking water and housed individually.
a dose of 2 g䡠kg body wt⫺1 䡠day⫺1 in a mouse is equivalent to the
common dose of 400 – 600 mg䡠kg body wt⫺1 䡠day⫺1 in humans according to methods of animal extrapolation (15).  xxxd3253xxx  (1.6 g䡠kg body
wt⫺1 䡠day⫺1) was added to the drinking water to mask the bitter taste
caused by the cr monohydrate (15). control animals received normal water.
during the mr experiments, animals were anesthetized with 1.5%
isoflurane in a gas mixture of 50% o2 and 50% n2o delivered through
a face mask. rectal temperature was monitored using a fluoroptic
thermometer (luxtron 712) and maintained at 37.0 ⫾ 1°c using a
warm water bed. breathing frequency was monitored optically (sirecust 401, siemens). all experiments were approved by the local
animal ethics committee, and animals were killed by cervical dislocation after termination of the study.
mr experiments. mrs measurements were performed on a 7.0-t
magnet (magnex scientific, abingdon, uk) interfaced to an smis
spectrometer (surrey medical systems, surrey, uk) operating at
300.20 mhz for 1h. the magnet had a free bore size of 120 mm and
j appl physiol • vol

was equipped with a 150 mt/m shielded gradient set. localized 1h
mrs was performed on skeletal muscle and brain using a steam
sequence (4) with an echo time (te) of 10 ms, a mixing time (tm) of
15 ms, and a repetition time (tr) of 5,000 ms, and vapor water
suppression (26). for brain measurements, 256 averages were acquired (measurement time 22 min), and 128 averages were acquired
for skeletal muscle measurements (measurement time 11 min).
for brain measurements, a 16 mm surface coil was used and voxels
(areas of interest) were acquired of the cerebellum (1.6 ⫻ 1.6 ⫻ 2.3
mm) and thalamus/hippocampus region (2.0 ⫻ 2.0 ⫻ 2.2 mm). the
location of the voxels was guided by gradient echo mr images
acquired in three oblique, perpendicular directions (te ⫽ 10 ms,
tr ⫽ 4,000 ms, slice thickness 1 mm, bandwidth 100 khz, matrix
size 128 ⫻ 128, 14 slices). voxels were field shimmed until a line
width [full width half maximum (fwhm)] of 13 hz (thalamus/
hippocampus) or 17 hz (cerebellum) or less was reached.
for skeletal muscle measurements, an alderman-grant type of coil
was used with the leg positioned under the magic angle (⬃55°) with
respect to the main magnetic field to reduce dipolar interactions (13).
a voxel (2 ⫻ 2 ⫻ 4 mm) was positioned in the triceps surae muscles
of the hind leg, guided by gradient echo mr images acquired in three
oblique, perpendicular directions (te ⫽ 5 ms, tr ⫽ 250 ms for
coronal and sagittal slices, tr ⫽ 300 ms for transversal slices, slice
thickness 0.5 mm, bandwidth 100 khz, matrix size 256 ⫻ 256, 10
slices for coronal and sagittal directions, 15 for transversal). field
shimming on the voxel was performed until a line width (fwhm) of
25 hz or less was reached. outer volume suppression was applied to
minimize contributions from fat or bone.
of all  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice (n ⫽ 25), an 1h mr spectrum was acquired
of brain (n ⫽ 16) or skeletal muscle (n ⫽ 9) before cr supplementation. thereafter, mice were randomly divided in six groups (4 for
brain and 2 for skeletal muscle), and a localized 1h mr spectrum was
acquired at different time points during the cr supplementation period
of 35 days. each group of animals consisted of four animals. mice in
the brain group were measured three times: one time before and two
times during the supplementation period. this resulted in n ⫽ 4 mice
for each time point during cr supplementation, except for days 9 and
35 (n ⫽ 2). mice in the skeletal muscle group were measured four
times: one time before and three times during the cr supplementation
period. as one mouse died during the cr supplementation period, an
extra mouse was added to complete all time points to n ⫽ 4. localized
1
h mr spectra of the same locations were recorded for con animals
on a cr-free diet (n ⫽ 4).
data analysis. data processing of the 1h mr spectra was performed
using the unsuppressed water signal for eddy current correction and
normalization. mr spectra of brain were processed in the frequency
domain using the lcmodel 6.1-4f software package (28). the basis set
of model used as input for lcmodel was simulated using nmrsim
(bruker biospin, version 4.6a) with the same sequence and parameters as
the in vivo measurements. for proton spin systems of total cr,  xxxd2360xxx  (ins), taurine (tau), total choline, glx (glutamine and glutamate
signal around 2 ppm), and n-acetylaspartate (naa), known values for t1
and t2 relaxation times for rat brain were used (7). the spin systems of
other metabolites were simulated with a line broadening of 4 hz. for
absolute quantification using the unsuppressed water signal, a mean tissue
water content of 78% was assumed (14) and the signal for naa was used
as a reference.
mr spectra of skeletal muscle were processed in the time domain
using the jmrui software package (23a). the first-order phase was
constrained to zero as the first acquired data point was acquired at the
top of the echo. as prior knowledge in both con and  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺
animals, the line width of the cr signal was constrained to 0.8 times
the tau signal (experimentally determined in con animals) and the
integral of the methylene signal of cr was set at a ratio of 0.67 to that
of the methyl signal of cr. for absolute quantification, water content
was assumed to be 76% (37) and t2 correction was applied as
described before (30).

cr supplementation in  xxxg858xxx -deficient mice

statistics. differences in final cr concentration (i.e., the average cr
concentration from days 25 and 35 combined) between cerebellum
and the thalamus/hippocampus locations and between con and
 xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ animals were compared using a student’s t-test.
linear regression was used to compare the increase in cr concentration between skeletal muscle and the two brain regions from day 1
to day 16 (brain) or 25 (skeletal muscle) of cr supplementation.
differences were considered significant at p ⬍ 0.05 and are presented
as means ⫾ sd in the text.
results

gradient echo mr images of the brain of con and
 xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice ensured reproducible localization of the voxels for 1h mrs in both cerebellum and thalamus/hippocampus
regions (fig. 1). corresponding spectra of the thalamus/hippocampus region in a con and  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ animal before cr
supplementation are shown in fig. 1, e and f. because of the
almost complete absence peaks at 3.0 and 3.9 ppm, cr appears
to be virtually absent in the brain of  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ animals.
during the 35 days of cr supplementation to  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺
animals, the cr concentration in both the cerebellum and
thalamus/hippocampus regions in brain increased (fig. 2),
showing that cr is taken up into the brain from the blood in
 xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. linear regression analysis of the increase in
cr concentration from day 0 to day 16 showed a linear increase
(r2 ⬎ 0.94 for both regions) in cr concentration in both
cerebellum and thalamus/hippocampus (0.8 ⫾ 0.11 and 0.8 ⫾
0.07 mm/day, respectively). rates of increase in cr levels did
not differ significantly between the two regions. the increase
in cr concentration in thalamus/hippocampus stabilized already after 16 days, whereas it continued to increase at the
same rate in cerebellum.
both in  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ animals at the end of the supplementation period and in con animals, the cr concentration was
significantly higher in the cerebellum compared with the thal-

cr supplementation in  xxxg858xxx -deficient mice

hippocampus region (fig. 3) and a slight increase in tau
cerebellum. all other metabolites remained constant (table 1).
reproducible placement of the voxel for 1h mrs in the
triceps surae muscle of con and  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice was guided
by gradient echo images (fig. 4). as was already observed for
the brain of  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, the cr content was minimal in
skeletal muscle as indicated by an almost complete absence of
signals at 3.0 and 3.9 ppm in the 1h mr spectrum (fig. 4d).
in the skeletal muscle of con animals, cr showed clear singlets
at these positions (fig. 4e).
during the first day of cr supplementation, a rapid increase
in cr concentration in skeletal muscle was observed (fig. 5),
showing that also in skeletal muscle, uptake of cr from the
blood is important. the increase in absolute cr concentration
after 24 h was over 10-fold faster in skeletal muscle compared
with thalamus/hippocampus, showing an increase of 14 ⫾ 5
mm for the first day. after this rapid increase, the rate of
increase in cr concentration in skeletal muscle decreased to
0.8 ⫾ 0.06 mm/day until day 25 (r2 ⫽ 0.99). interestingly, this
rate of increase was similar in both cerebellum and thalamus/
hippocampus. after 35 days of cr supplementation, cr concentrations in skeletal muscle of  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice were significantly higher than in con animals on a cr-free diet.
relative increases in cr concentration, compared with the
con concentration, were calculated for both skeletal muscle
and brain regions. in skeletal muscle, the relative increase for
the first day was higher than in brain, 49 ⫾ 20% for skeletal
muscle and 2 ⫾ 6% for thalamus/hippocampus. when linear
regression was applied to relative increases during the second
week, the increase in thalamus/hippocampus was higher compared with skeletal muscle. relative cr increases in cerebellum
and thalamus/hippocampus did not differ significantly.
discussion

this study shows that cr supplementation for 1 mo in
 xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice results in a compensation of cr levels in both
skeletal muscle and brain, despite very low cr levels in these
tissues before cr supplementation. due to a large increase
during the first day of cr supplementation, the increase in cr
concentration in skeletal muscle was faster compared with the

increase in cr levels in brain. thereafter, the rate of increase in
cr levels was similar in two regions in brain and in skeletal
muscle.
before cr supplementation, localized 1h mrs showed very
low cr levels in brain of  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, in agreement with
our previous studies on these animals (30, 31). very low cr
levels in brain were also observed in  xxxg858xxx -deficient patients
(see e.g., ref. 40), supporting the use of the mouse model as a
model for the disease in patients. other studies on adult mouse
brain using short te localized 1h mrs have observed similar
cr concentrations in mouse brain of the same strain compared
with con animals in the present study for both regions in brain
(30, 36, 42). higher cr levels in cerebellum compared with
other regions in brain, as observed in con mice in the present
study, have also been observed in healthy volunteers (16, 27).
curiously, one study using long te localized 1h mrs in
3-wk-old mice found higher cr concentrations in thalamus
compared with cerebellum and higher values of cr in thalamus
compared with the present study (20). the reason for this
discrepancy is unclear. tissue levels of naa, gln, and glu in
both thalamus/hippocampus and cerebellum in con mice were
in agreement with a recent study on mouse brain (42).
in  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ animals before cr supplementation, a small
elevation was observed in naa in the thalamus/hippocampus
region. interestingly, an increase in naa levels has also been
observed in mice lacking both brain isoforms of creatine
kinase, the enzyme catalyzing the phosphorylation of cr (14).
increased naa levels could result from several factors, including adaptations in intracellular pathways, a redistribution of
cerebral osmolytes or changes in cell size or cell type distribution across brain regions (ref. 14 and references therein). in
both creatine kinase-deficient mice and  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, the
increased naa levels are accompanied by a decreased cr level
and as the increased naa level disappeared after normalization of cr levels in the present study, a redistribution of
cerebral metabolites may play a role in this observation.
the cr concentration in both the cerebellum and thalamus/
hippocampus region in  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice normalized to, and
even exceeded, control levels after 35 days of cr supplementation. if these results in  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice can be extrapolated
to normal brain, this large uptake of cr from the blood could
indicate that the novo synthesis of cr is not of large importance
in the brain. the strong reduction of cr in the brain of
crt-deficient patients (5) agrees with this suggestion. on the
other hand, it is well possible that  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice have
adapted to the absence of cr biosynthesis in the brain, for
instance by upregulating the activity and/or level of the crt
(22). furthermore, a strict separation of cells that synthesize cr
and cells that accumulate the compound could exist in the brain
(23, 32), thereby causing the absence of cr in crt-deficient
patients. recent studies where expression of the  xxxg858xxx  enzyme was observed mainly in glial cells and astrocytes, with
only minimal expression in neurons, supports this hypothesis
(31, 41). however, results on the expression of  xxxg858xxx  are not
conclusive, as another study found ubiquitous expression of
this enzyme in the brain (1).
as in brain, also in skeletal muscle of  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice cr
levels before cr supplementation were very low, in accordance
with previous studies (17, 18, 30, 31). cr levels in skeletal
muscle determined in con animals agree well with our previous study using 1h mrs on mouse hind leg of the same strain

this indicates that the phosphorylated fraction of cr remains
the same after cr supplementation, in contrast to observations
in some studies using muscle biopsies (9) but in agreement
with our previous mrs study on human skeletal muscle (19).
repeated mrs measurements enabled an accurate determination of the time course of the increase in cr levels in
 xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. this revealed that after the rapid increase of
cr in skeletal muscle during the first day of cr supplementation, the increase in cr decreased to a constant rate thereafter.
a recent study in rat skeletal muscle after cr depletion by
␤-guanidinopropionic acid feeding showed a significant elevation in cr uptake rates during the first few days of cr supplementation after cr depletion (3), but this occurred only in the
high oxidative fibers. interestingly, this increased uptake was
not accompanied by an increased crt expression. this indicates that other mechanisms are responsible for the regulation
of cr uptake at low cr concentrations in skeletal muscle, like,
for instance, the regulation of the activity of the transporter (3).
alternatively, it has been suggested that, apart from the crt,
alternative cr uptake mechanisms exist in skeletal muscle, as
cr is present in skeletal muscle of crt-deficient patients (29).
in contrast to the presence of cr in  xxxg858xxx -deficient muscle,
however, cr in these patients could also result from cr biosynthesis in skeletal muscle itself (2, 31). finally, a nonsat-

cr supplementation in  xxxg858xxx -deficient mice

urable component of cr transport, likely diffusion of cr over
the cell membrane, has been reported, but only at unphysiological extracellular cr concentrations (⬎1.5 mm; ref. 44).
in brain, the rapid initial increase in cr as observed in
skeletal muscle was absent and, therefore, the increase in cr
levels in skeletal muscle was faster. these results are in
agreement with a study on a  xxxg858xxx -deficient patient (8) and a
study using cloned cells (25). it is possible that an incomplete
saturation of the crt plays a role in the difference between
skeletal muscle and brain. however, normal plasma concentrations of cr in the mouse well exceed the km of the crt of
16 ␮m (25), and it is therefore working near saturating levels
in vivo (38). since the present cr supplementation protocol has
been shown to elevate plasma cr concentration levels about
fivefold in the mouse (15), the crt is probably saturated with
this cr dose. alternatively, the limited permeability of the
blood-brain barrier for cr could play a role in the observed
difference. while the microcapillary endothelial cells have
been shown to express the crt, the astrocytes contacting them
have not (1, 25, 41) and it is unclear how this influences cr
uptake. interestingly, the absolute increase in cr in both tissues
is similar after the first day of cr supplementation, despite
large differences in the final cr concentration. this suggests
that, after the first day of cr supplementation, 0.8 mm/day
represents an upper limit for cr uptake by the crt in both
tissues in these mice. apparently, the combined effect of both
specific activity and number of crts is similar between the
tissues during this period.
in control mice with normal cr concentrations, the rate of
increase of cr levels in both skeletal muscle and brain during
cr supplementation is considerably lower than in  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺
mice in the present study (15). the low intracellular cr concentration at the start of the cr supplementation protocol in
 xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ probably influences this (22, 38). furthermore,
elevated serum gua concentrations in  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice apparently do not severely limit the uptake of cr. this could be due
to serum concentrations of gua in  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ animals below
concentrations where considerable limitations on cr uptake
have been observed (10, 25, 31).
while 31p mrs of skeletal muscle shows a clear signal for
pgua (e.g., refs. 8, 18, 30, 32, 34), the signal for gua
(representing pgua and gua) was hardly detectable in in vivo
1
h mr spectra of skeletal muscle in  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. even at
very low cr concentrations, when gua concentrations are
expected to be high (18, 30), the gua signal at best appeared as
a broad line. in contrast, using high-resolution magic angle
spinning methods, gua appears as a singlet at 3.78 ppm in
freeze-clamped skeletal muscle of  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice (30). in our
previous study on these mice, this curious result was ascribed
to possible influences of conformational or environmental
changes in vivo (30). in brain, gua is hard to detect in 1h mrs
as well, possibly due to the line shape but also because of many
overlapping peaks at the region where gua is resonating (like
glu, ins) and the low expected concentration of gua (⬃1.3
mm; ref. 30). although it remains a broad resonance, the
signal for gua is usually somewhat more clear in 1h mr
spectra of the brain of patients compared with the mouse model
in the present study (8, 40, 43). this could be due to conformational changes in gua, making the observation of its 1h
signal less favorable at a field strength of 7 t.

as was mentioned in the introduction, the increase in cr
levels in brain in  xxxg858xxx -deficient patients is slow and incomplete after 2 yr. this long time course not only hampers rapid
improvement of clinical symptoms in patients, it also makes
optimization of cr supplementation strategies time consuming.
furthermore, a more rapid increase in cr levels may prevent
the development of clinical symptoms when cr supplementation is started at a young age. the measurements obtained in
the present study could provide a basis for the optimization of
cr supplementation strategies in humans. measurements in
mice are more rapid compared with humans, and therapeutic
interventions can be applied easily. despite the absence in the
mouse model of the apparent biphasic pattern of the increase in
cr level in the brain of a  xxxg858xxx -deficient patient (39) and the
difference in time frame, we believe that the model can be used
to optimize cr supplementation strategies to be applied in
humans. any deviation from the uptake kinetics obtained in the
present study on  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice on a change in the cr
supplementation protocol would be a valuable starting point for
a similar protocol in humans. changes in the cr supplementation protocol could include an increase in the administered cr
dose. however, as the crt is likely to be saturated at the
current dose and previous attempts in humans have been
unsuccessful (39), a higher dose of cr is unlikely to increase
the cr uptake in brain. intermittent cr supplementation to
avoid possible saturation of the crt or supplementation or
restriction of other metabolites, as has been attempted before
with arginine and ornithine (8, 33), however, could provide a
useful strategy.
in conclusion, our results show that the faster increase in
skeletal muscle cr levels is only apparent at the beginning of
the cr supplementation period in  xxxg858xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. this more
rapid increase in skeletal muscle cr levels compared with brain
is probably not caused by an increased expression of the crt
in skeletal muscle in this period. finally, these results can
provide the basis for further experiments to optimize cr supplementation strategies in human  xxxg858xxx  deficiency.
