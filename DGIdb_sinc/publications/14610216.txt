interactions of human organic anion transporters with diuretics.  the tubular secretion of diuretics in the proximal tubule has been shown to be critical for the action of drugs. to elucidate the molecular mechanisms for the tubular excretion of diuretics, we have elucidated the interactions of human organic anion transporters (hoats) with diuretics using cells stably expressing hoats. diuretics tested were thiazides, including chlorothiazide,  xxxd1783xxx , hydrochlorothiazide, and  xxxd3425xxx ; loop diuretics, including bumetanide,  xxxd2049xxx , and furosemide; and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, including acetazolamide and  xxxd2592xxx . these diuretics inhibited organic anion uptake mediated by  xxxg2113xxx ,  xxxg2114xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx , and  xxxg2109xxx  in a competitive manner.  xxxg2113xxx  exhibited the highest affinity interactions for thiazides, whereas  xxxg2115xxx  did those for loop diuretics.  xxxg2113xxx ,  xxxg2115xxx , and  xxxg2109xxx  but not  xxxg2114xxx , mediated the uptake of bumetanide.  xxxg2115xxx  and  xxxg2109xxx , but not  xxxg2113xxx  mediated the efflux of bumetanide.  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx , but not  xxxg2114xxx  and  xxxg2109xxx  mediated the uptake of furosemide. in conclusion, it was suggested that  xxxg2113xxx  may play an important role in the basolateral uptake of thiazides, and  xxxg2115xxx  in the uptake of loop diuretics. in addition, it was also suggested that bumetanide taken up by  xxxg2115xxx  and/or  xxxg2113xxx  is excreted into the urine by  xxxg2109xxx .
