iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  (bexxar®):
radioimmunoconjugate therapy for
indolent and transformed b-cell
non-hodgkin’s lymphoma
jonathan w friedberg and richard i fisher†

expert opinion &
five-year view

 xxxd3405xxx  is an immunoglobulin g murine monoclonal antibody that binds to the cd20
antigen on the surface of normal and malignant human b-cells.  xxxd3405xxx  is linked
covalently with iodine-131 to produce the radioimmunoconjugate iodine-131
 xxxd3405xxx  (bexxar®). the iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  regimen was approved by the us
food and drug administration in june 2003 for the treatment of patients with cd20-positive,
follicular non-hodgkin's lymphoma, both with and without transformation, whose disease
is refractory to rituximab (rituxan®) and has relapsed following chemotherapy. the
dose-limiting toxicity of iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  is bone marrow suppression and resulting
cytopenias. unlike chemotherapy, the majority of nonhematologic adverse events
associated with iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  are mild to moderate in nature and usually self
limited. iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  represents one of the most active single agents for the
treatment of recurrent indolent and transformed b-cell non-hodgkin's lymphoma, as
demonstrated by several clinical trials summarized in this review. at the present time, the
use of radioimmunoconjugate therapy is largely limited to patients with disease refractory
to rituximab therapy and transformed disease not amenable to high-dose therapy and
autologous stem cell support. longer follow-up of ongoing clinical trials should provide
reassurance as to safety and insights as to the additive stem cell toxicity from iodine-131
 xxxd3405xxx  administration. studies are also addressing the role of iodine-131
 xxxd3405xxx  as a component of initial therapy for indolent non-hodgkin's lymphoma and
in additional histologies of non-hodgkin's lymphoma.

non-hodgkin’s lymphoma (nhl) is the fifth
most common and sixth most fatal cancer in
the usa and has increased significantly in
incidence over the past 30 years. approximately 270,000 people with nhl are currently living in the usa; 120,000 of them
have indolent histologies, the most common of
which is follicular nhl [1]. the national
cancer institute estimates that over 60,000
new cases of nhl will be diagnosed in the
usa this year, and around 25,000 of those
cases will be indolent histologies [2], more than
90% of which are of b-cell derivation.

over 80% of patients with indolent nhl
present with stage iii/iv disease, usually due
to bone marrow involvement. it is generally
accepted that patients with advanced stage
indolent nhl are incurable by conventional
therapy, including alkylating agents, purine
analogs, or combinations, and the median
survival has not changed significantly in the
past 30 years [3–6]. the choice of conventional chemotherapeutic approaches depends
upon several factors, including tumor bulk,
patient performance status, patient age and
degree of symptoms [7–9]. some patients with
advanced stage indolent nhl do not
require immediate therapy, however, within

monoclonal antibody therapy

few advances in the treatment of indolent nhl have had such
dramatic impact as the anti-cd20 monoclonal antibody rituximab (rituxan®/ xxxd3132xxx ®, roche, basel, switzerland; idec,
ca usa; and genentech, inc., ca, usa). rituximab is a
chimeric anti-cd20 monoclonal antibody with both murine
and human components [11]. the mechanism of cytotoxicity
induced by rituximab therapy in humans is not completely
understood [12,13]. both complement-mediated cytotoxicity and
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (adcc) have
been demonstrated in vitro [14,15]. in addition, direct apoptosis
due to crosslinking of cd20 and cell signaling has been
observed in some malignant cell lines [16–18].
a pivotal clinical trial of rituximab (375 mg/m2/week ×
4 weeks) in 166 patients with relapsed or refractory follicular
or low-grade lymphoma showed an overall response rate of
48%, with 6% complete responses (cr) [19]. adverse events
were brief and usually related to the initial infusion. only
one patient developed an antichimeric antibody response.
these promising results and very favorable toxicity profile
led to us food and drug administration (fda) approval
for use in patients with refractory or relapsed low-grade or
follicular lymphoma. retreatment with rituximab also
appears to be safe, with a safety profile similar to that for a first
course of treatment and a response rate of approximately 40%
in one study [20]. rituximab, therefore, compares favorably to
single-agent chemotherapy, with a significantly better toxicity
profile, particularly for patients with indolent lymphoma.
however, in patients with indolent nhl, at least 50% of
patients do not respond to rituximab therapy and all patients
will experience disease progression at some point following
rituximab therapy.
radioimmunotherapy

the mechanisms of rituximab resistance in vivo are poorly
understood. since adcc may be an important component
of rituximab therapy, inadequate effector cell responses may
limit its efficacy. moreover, in patients with bulky disease,
insufficient binding of antibody due to poor access to the
tumor cells, or low antigen expression, may occur [12]. radioimmunoconjugates, for example murine monoclonal antibodies with an attached radioisotope, may overcome these
resistance mechanisms [21]. due to the inherent radiosensitivity
of indolent lymphoma cells, radioimmunoconjugates have
the ability to provide direct cytotoxicity in the absence of
host effector mechanisms and in the presence of impaired
adcc. furthermore, the bystander or crossfire effect, which
delivers radiation to neighboring cells inaccessible to antibody or with insufficient antigen expression, can result in
cytotoxicity, even in the absence of antibody binding to a
particular target cell.

market profile

rituximab was approved by the fda in 1997 for the treatment
of patients with relapsed or refractory indolent b-cell nhl.
sales of this agent in the usa now exceed 1 billion dollars
annually, suggesting frequent and repeated use in many histologies of nhl and significant use in other indications. interferon
(ifn)-alpha2b, another biologic compound, is approved by the
fda for the initial treatment of clinically aggressive follicular
nhl in conjunction with anthracycline-containing combination chemotherapy in patients 18 years of age or older. several
prospective randomized trials have conflicting results, but there
is almost uniformly no evidence of an overall survival benefit
with ifn use [22–24]. due to significant toxicity and the availability of other options, ifn is rarely used in the usa for
patients with nhl [25].
the first radioimmunoconjugate, yttrium-90-labeled  xxxd2312xxx  (zevalin®, idec), was approved by the fda
in february of 2002 for the treatment of patients with relapsed
or refractory b-cell low-grade or transformed nhl, including
patients with rituximab-refractory follicular nhl. a phase iii
randomized study compared yttrium-90  xxxd2312xxx 
radioimmunotherapy with rituximab in 143 patients with
relapsed or refractory low-grade, follicular, or transformed
cd20-positive nhl. the overall response rate was 80% for
the yttrium-90  xxxd2312xxx  group versus 56% for the
rituximab group, which reached statistical significance. cr
rates were 30 and 16% in the yttrium-90  xxxd2312xxx 
and rituximab groups, respectively. however, there was no
statistically significant benefit in response duration or survival
between the two groups [26]. a phase ii study in patients with
indolent lymphoma refractory to rituximab demonstrated a
74% response rate, with a response duration of 6.4 months, for
yttrium-90  xxxd2312xxx  therapy [27].
despite these promising results, the initial sales of yttrium-90
 xxxd2312xxx  have been lower than expected [28].
efforts at educating the medical community about radioimmunotherapy as a novel modality of treatment modality are
ongoing. the results of clinical trials evaluating the safety and
efficacy of radioimmunotherapy in additional histologies and at
an earlier timepoint of disease in combination with chemotherapy will largely determine the future market potential of
radioimmunoconjugates. additionally, the results of prospective
trials evaluating repeated administrations of these agents will
impact the number of patients eligible for this treatment.

iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  (bexxar®)

the southwest oncology group recently reported the outcome of a novel chemoimmunotherapeutic approach, combining
standard induction chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone [chop]) followed by consolidation with iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx . this phase ii trial
included 90 patients with previously untreated, advanced-stage
follicular nhl [44]. the overall response rate to the entire treatment regimen (chemotherapy + iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx ) was
90%, including 67% complete remissions. the 2-year progression-free survival was estimated to be 81%, which is better than
observed historically with chop alone [43] or chop plus
rituximab [45,46]. toxicity was largely limited to expected and
reversible myelosuppression. this combined approach of chop
followed by iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  for patients with previously untreated, advanced-stage follicular nhl is currently
being compared with the chop plus rituximab regimen in an
ongoing randomized phase iii trial conducted by the southwest
oncology group and the cancer and leukemia group b.
studies in transformed disease

a major cause of morbidity and mortality for patients with
indolent lymphomas is transformation to a diffuse aggressive
histology, with median survival following histologic conversion in most series of less than 2 years for patients with follicular lymphoma [3,10]. although a subset of patients with histologic transformation have prolonged responses to standard
chemotherapy regimens [47], or aggressive approaches with
high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation
[48], new approaches applicable to the majority of patients with
histological transformation are needed.
zelenetz and colleagues analyzed 71 patients with histological
transformation of indolent lymphoma treated with iodine-131
 xxxd3405xxx  on five different clinical trials [49]. the median
number of prior therapies for these patients was four, and over
half of the patients had poor prognoses using the international
prognostic index for nhl [50]. the overall response rate to a
single treatment with iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  in this setting
was 39%, with a median response duration of 20 months. of
these patients, 24% had a response duration of more than a year.
given the relatively low toxicity profile of the iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  regimen compared with autologous stem cell transplantation, the radioimmunotherapy approach holds significant
promise for patients with transformed disease.

studies using high-dose therapy & autologous stem cell support

the rationale for the use of high-dose therapy in nhl is based
upon the observation that lymphomas have a steep
dose–response curve to chemotherapy and radiation in animal
models and human systems. high-dose therapy has been shown
to be a potentially curative modality for patients with relapsed,
diffuse aggressive nhl and may provide prolonged disease-free
intervals in patients with indolent lymphoma [51,52]. when
bone marrow is used as a source of stem cells for autologous
stem cell transplantation, the detection of lymphoma cells by
pcr is a highly significant predictor of subsequent relapse [53].
strategies to obtain pcr negativity (molecular remissions) in
bone marrow prior to autologous transplantation have focused
on monoclonal antibody-based techniques, either in vitro [54,55]
or in vivo [56].
given the ability to perform patient-specific dosimetry and
the potential for in vivo purging of residual bone marrow lymphoma, iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  may be an ideal agent to use
as a component of myeloablative high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell support [57]. at the fred hutchinson cancer
research center in seattle (wa, usa), 29 patients received
therapeutic infusions of single-agent iodine-131-labeled  xxxd3132xxx , given at the protein dose found optimal in a biodistribution study, labeled with amounts of iodine-131 calculated to
deliver specific absorbed radiation doses to the normal organs,
followed by autologous stem cell support. with a median follow-up of 42 months, the progression-free survival was 42%,
comparing favorably with both conventional chemotherapy
and with studies using external beam total-body irradiation
conditioning and autologous stem cell support [58,59]. late toxicities have been uncommon, except for elevated tsh levels
found in approximately 60% of the subjects. two patients
developed secondary myelodysplasia, the major late toxicity in
patients with lymphoma undergoing autologous stem cell
transplantation [60].
more recently, press and colleagues in seattle have combined
iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  with etoposide and cyclophosphamide ( xxxd1779xxx ®, baxter, il, usa), followed by autologous
stem cell transplant in 52 patients with relapsed b-cell lymphoma [61]. the estimated overall and progression-free survival of all treated patients at 2 years was 83 and 68%, respectively, using this approach. a cohort of 16 patients with

in various nhl histologies are ongoing.

safety & tolerability

the dose-limiting toxicity of iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  is bone
marrow suppression and resulting cytopenia. the nadir of
blood counts occurs 5–7 weeks following treatment with
iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  in most patients. a total of 26% of
patients on clinical trials received supportive care for cytopenia,
which included growth factors or transfusions. extensive prior
therapy and degree of bone marrow involvement by nhl are
risk factors for hematological toxicity following iodine-131
 xxxd3405xxx  therapy.
unlike chemotherapy, the majority of nonhematologic
adverse events associated with iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  are
mild to moderate in nature and usually self limited. asthenia,
arthralgia and generalized or localized pain have been
reported, as well as nausea, vomiting and headaches. allergic
reactions associated with the murine proteins occur in less
than 5% of patients treated with iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx . as
with other monoclonal antibodies, anaphylaxis is very rare.
infections in the form of neutropenia have been reported,
including life-threatening and fatal infections.
in addition to the immediate toxicities, it is important to
monitor long-term toxicities following therapy with
radioimmunoconjugates. despite the suggested thyroid protection as part of the iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  regimen, approximately 8% of patients developed increased tsh following
treatment, with a cumulative incidence of 12.1% at 4 years,
which is easily treated with oral replacement of levothyroxine.
hama formation is inversely related to the extent of prior
therapy, but may occur in up to 85% of previously untreated
patients. the implications of hama development are
unknown but in theory, they might limit the ability to respond
to other murine monoclonal antibody treatments.
although radioimmunotherapy with iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  results in transient b-cell depletion, a long-term,
immunologic evaluation of 31 previously untreated patients
with follicular lymphoma treated with iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  revealed no evidence of loss of acquired humoral
immunity against tetanus or measles [64]. there was a temporary decline in t-cell subpopulations, but no reduction in
serum immunoglobulin levels was observed in the setting of
peripheral b-lymphocyte depletion. importantly, plasma cells
are not depleted with this therapy.
the major long-term toxicity associated with chemotherapy
and radiation therapy in patients with lymphoma is the development of fatal myelodysplasia and associated acute myelogenous
leukemia. in one series of patients treated with low-dose external
beam total-body irradiation for nhl, the 15-year estimated
cumulative incidence of myelodysplasia was 17% [65]. all of these
patients were also treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy, suggesting

23

that combined modality therapy significantly increases the incidence of subsequent stem cell disorders. the highest risks of
secondary myelodysplasia have been reported in the setting of
autologous stem cell transplantation, where the cumulative incidence in several series exceeds 15% [60]. in a study of 773 patients
treated with iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx , 21 patients developed
myelodysplasia, with an annualized incidence of only 1.45% per
year, which compares favorably with patients treated with
alkylating-agent chemotherapy [66]. however, long-term followup of this large cohort of patients is clearly required to definitively determine the incidence of this fatal complication and the
degree to which radioimmunotherapy contributes to this risk.
expert opinion & five-year view

iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  represents one of the most active single
agents for the treatment of recurrent indolent and transformed
b-cell nhl. iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  and yttrium-90  xxxd2312xxx  are targeted radioimmunotherapy agents
approved for the treatment of lymphoma. at the present time,
the use of these compounds should largely be limited to patients
with disease refractory to rituximab therapy and transformed disease not amenable to high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell
support [67]. longer follow-up of the larger clinical trials should
provide reassurance as to safety and insights as to the additive
stem cell toxicity from iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  administration.
if the ongoing intergroup trial comparing chop/rituximab
with chop followed by iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  suggests a
benefit to radioimmunoconjugate therapy, iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  could become part of initial therapy for indolent lymphoma. extensive follow-up of this study will be required, however, since time-to-progression end points for previously untreated
patients require years of observation and it will be critical to
follow patients for long-term events such as myelodysplasia
before this therapy is adapted as the standard of care.
there is no data comparing the outcome following iodine-131
 xxxd3405xxx  therapy with yttrium-90  xxxd2312xxx 
therapy. the activity of these two compounds appears to be
similar when comparing the phase ii trials in similar patient
populations. the latter compound does not require patientspecific dosimetry. the particle path lengths of these two radioimmunoconjugates differs, with some suggesting that the
shorter path length of iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  may be more
effective in eradicating minimal residual disease; whereas the
longer path length of yttrium-90  xxxd2312xxx  may be
more active in patients with larger lymph node masses [67]. a
randomized trial comparing these two agents in patients with
relapsed, follicular nhl is currently under development.
major outstanding questions associated with
radioimmunotherapy

• what is the optimal timing of radioimmunotherapy in the
treatment of indolent nhl?
• what is the role of radioimmunotherapy in the treatment of
more aggressive histologies of nhl, potentially in combination
with chemotherapy and novel biologic agents?

expert rev. anticancer ther. 4(1), (2004)

iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  (bexxar®)

• what is the role of myeloablative radioimmunotherapy and
autologous (or allogeneic) stem cell support in nhl?
• what is the true long-term toxicity of these agents, particularly
the cumulative risk of secondary myelodysplasia?
• can one safely retreat patients with radioimmunotherapy
and what is the efficacy of retreatment?

key issues
• iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  (bexxar®) represents one of the most active single agents for the treatment of recurrent, indolent and
transformed b-cell non-hodgkin’s lymphoma (nhl).
• the dose-limiting toxicity of iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  is bone marrow suppression and resulting cytopenia. the nadir of blood
counts occurs 5–7 weeks following treatment with iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  in most patients, and resolves within 12 weeks
following therapy.
• long-term toxicities associated with iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  include hypothyroidism, human antimouse antibody formation and a
low incidence of secondary myelodysplastic syndrome.
• at the present time, the use of iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  is largely limited to patients with disease refractory to rituximab therapy
and transformed disease not amenable to high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell support.
• ongoing studies are addressing the role of iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx  as a component of initial therapy for indolent nhl and in
additional histologies of nhl.
