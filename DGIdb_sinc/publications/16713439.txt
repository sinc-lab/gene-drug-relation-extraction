abstract
postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia are considered risk factors for cardiovascular disease. this study was designed to
elucidate whether improving the postprandial state by  xxxd3524xxx , an a-glucosidase inhibitor, leads to the reduction of oxidative stress markers
and soluble adhesion molecules in obese type 2 diabetic patients. a total of 30 japanese obese type 2 diabetic patients were randomly
assigned and treated for 3 weeks with either diet alone (the control group) or diet plus  xxxd3524xxx  (0.9 mg daily) (the  xxxd3524xxx  group) (n = 15
each). analysis of the diurnal metabolic profiles revealed a significant reduction of postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in the
 xxxd3524xxx  group relative to the control group ( p b .05), despite the similar improvement in body mass index and hemoglobin a1c in both
groups.  xxxd3524xxx  also decreased significantly the plasma levels of soluble  xxxg1127xxx  and urinary excretion of 8-isoprostaglandin f2a and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine ( p b .01) and  xxxg520xxx  ( p b .05) relative to the control group. in conclusion, this
study represents the first demonstration that  xxxd3524xxx  reduces oxidative stress generation and soluble  xxxg1127xxx  in
parallel with the reduction of postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in obese type 2 diabetic patients.

1. introduction
the metabolic syndrome, the coexistence of several risk
factors for atherosclerosis, including visceral obesity, hyperglycemia, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and hypertension, has
been considered to be a precursor of cardiovascular disease
(cvd) [1]. systemic inflammation and oxidative stress have
been postulated to be important pathogenic factors in the
development of the metabolic syndrome and thus atherosclerosis [2]. evidence has accumulated suggesting that the

postprandial state including postprandial hyperglycemia and
hyperlipidemia contributes to the development of atherosclerosis through oxidative stress generation in diabetes-related
metabolic derangements [3].
recent epidemiological studies such as the decode/
decoda study and funagata diabetes study have
revealed that serum glucose level 2 hours after an oral
challenge with glucose or postprandial hyperglycemia is an
independent risk factor and is a more powerful predictor of
cvd and mortality than the level of fasting plasma glucose
(pg) [4,5]. it was suggested that postprandial hyperglycemia is involved in the initiation and promotion of
atherosclerosis via multiple mechanisms such as oxidative
stress generation, low-density lipoprotein oxidation, and
thrombosis activation, and endothelial dysfunction ensues in
a setting of meal-induced antioxidant consumption [6].
thus, antidiabetic agents that are capable of reducing

postprandial hyperglycemia are desirable to prevent cardiovascular events associated with diabetes.
a-glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose and  xxxd3524xxx 
are thought to act at the small intestine by competitively
inhibiting enzymes that delay the release of glucose from
complex carbohydrates, thereby specifically reducing postprandial glucose excursion [7]. they are widely used to
reduce postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in
diabetic patients [7]. it has been demonstrated in the study to
prevent non–insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (stopniddm) trial that acarbose can delay the development of type
2 diabetes mellitus in patients with impaired glucose tolerance
(igt) [8]. the acarbose treatment has also been associated
with a significantly lower incidence of cvd, newly diagnosed
hypertension, and progression of intima-media thickness
(imt) in subjects with igt [9,10]. moreover, it was shown
by meta-analysis that acarbose can prevent myocardial
infarction and cvd in type 2 diabetic patients [11].
type 2 diabetes mellitus is often associated with
abnormalities in plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles, and
postprandial hyperlipidemia has been shown to be an
independent risk factor and predictor of atherosclerosis
and cvd [12]. because carbohydrates are highly lipogenic
precursors, retardation of their digestion by a-glucosidase
inhibitors is likely to affect lipid metabolism. indeed, a
single dose of acarbose suppresses postprandial hyperlipidemia as well as postprandial hyperglycemia [13]. however,
whether  xxxd3524xxx  can reduce postprandial hyperlipidemia
has not been tested so far. furthermore, whether improving
the postprandial state by a-glucosidase inhibitors can reduce
other risk factors of cvd is also unknown. the aim of this
study was to elucidate whether improving the postprandial
state by  xxxd3524xxx  leads to the reduction of systemic
inflammation, oxidative stress markers, and soluble adhesion molecules in obese type 2 diabetic patients.

2. methods
2.1. subjects
a total of 30 japanese obese type 2 diabetic patients
(14 men and 16 women; mean age, 46.2 f 2.7 years; mean
body mass index [bmi], 32.8 f 1.2 kg/m 2; mean
hemoglobin a1c [hba1c], 7.7% f 0.4%) were recruited in
our clinics between april 2002 and june 2004 (table 1).
the patients had stable hba1c levels (6.5% v hba1c v
9.5%). the study protocol was approved by the ethical
committee on human research of kyoto medical center
and tokyo medical and dental university, and all participants gave written informed consent.
2.2. study protocols
the patients were assigned to one of the following
treatment groups (a single-blind and run-in period randomization, which patients received): they were treated on
a hospital basis for 3 weeks with either diet alone (the
control group) (7 men and 8 women; mean age, 46.0 f
4.1 years; n = 15) or diet plus  xxxd3524xxx  (0.9 mg daily)
(the  xxxd3524xxx  group) (7 men and 8 women; mean age,
46.3 f 3.6 years; n = 15). the patients were hospitalized
for the entire study. before the study, 2 patients in the
control group and 2 in the  xxxd3524xxx  group had been
treated with sulfonylureas; 1 patient in the control group
and one in the  xxxd3524xxx  group had been treated with
metformin; whereas the remaining 12 patients from each
group had only received diet therapy. the administration
of sulfonylureas and metformin was continued with fixed
dosages throughout the study. diet therapy consisted of
104.6 kj/kg of ideal body weight per day. they consumed
57% of total energy as carbohydrate, 25% as fat, and 18%
as protein. in examining the diurnal metabolic profiles, all
patients were instructed to maintain the same level of

788

n. satoh et al. / metabolism clinical and experimental 55 (2006) 786 – 793

energy intake and physical activity for 3 weeks during
hospitalization; they were served with the standard meals
for diabetic patients at 8:00 am, 12:00 pm, and 5:00 pm
throughout the study. all the food consumed by the
patients in this study was only the food served by hospital.
they also underwent counseling on dietetics one month
before and twice during hospitalization. patients treated
with  xxxg36xxx  inhibitors or  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists were excluded. lipidlowering medications such as statins and fibrates were
also excluded. none received thiazolidinediones and
hormone replacement therapy.
at the beginning and at the end of the study, we
examined bmi, hba1c, 1,5-anhydro-d-glucitol (1,5-ag),
pg, immunoreactive insulin (iri), c-peptide reaction
(cpr), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance
(homa-ir) [14], total cholesterol (t-chol), high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c), triglycerides (tgs), free
 xxxd2154xxx  (ffa),  xxxg175xxx  (apob), apolipoprotein
e (apoe), leptin, adiponectin,  xxxg520xxx  (crp),
soluble  xxxg1127xxx  (sicam-1), and
soluble  xxxg2406xxx  (svcam-1),
and urinary excretion of 8-iso-prostaglandin f2a (8-isopgf2a) and 8-hydroxy-2v-deoxyguanosine (8-ohdg).
before and 3 weeks after the  xxxd3524xxx  treatment, blood
samples were taken before each meal and 90 minutes after
breakfast and lunch to measure pg, iri, cpr, tg, ffa,
apob, and apoe.
2.3. plasma parameter measurements
for plasma separation, each blood sample was immediately transferred to chilled siliconized glass tubes containing edta (1 mg/ml) and centrifuged at 48c. plasma
samples were frozen and stored at 708c until assay.
hemoglobin a1c, pg, cpr, t-chol, hdl-c, tg, ffa,
apob, and apoe levels were measured according to the
standard procedures. serum 1,5-ag concentrations were
determined by an established enzymatic method using a
1,5-ag clinical test kit (lana-1,5-ag, nippon kayaku,
tokyo, japan). immunoreactive insulin was measured by
enzyme immunoassay using a commercially available kit
(tosoh, tokyo, japan). plasma concentrations of leptin and
adiponectin were determined using the respective radioimmunoassay kits (linco research, st charles, mo) [15].
plasma levels of crp were measured by the latex-enhanced
assay using particle-enhanced technology performed on the
behring bn nephelometer (dade behring, marburg,
germany) [15]. soluble intercellular adhesion molecule
1 and svcam-1 were measured using commercially
available immunoassays from research and diagnostic
systems (minneapolis, minn) [16].
2.4. urinary parameter measurements
a morning urine sample was collected from each patient
and stored frozen at 708c using n2 gas. urine samples
were centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx  000  g for 10 minutes, and after

proper dilution the supernatant was used for the determination of 8-iso- xxxd1902xxx  using an elisa method using a kit
from cayman laboratories (ann arbor, mich) [17].
8-hydroxy-2v-deoxyguanosine was measured by a competitive elisa kit (8-ohdg check, japan institute for the
control of aging, fukuroi, shizuoka, japan) [18].
2.5. statistical analysis
data are presented as the mean f se, and p b .05 was
considered statistically significant. the student 2-tailed t
test was used for baseline comparison between the 2 groups,
and for comparison of differences between the means within
each group before and after the study. in this study, the
diurnal metabolic profiles within each group before and
after the study were assessed by the student 2-tailed t test
and analysis of variance. all statistical analyses were
performed using the statview program version 5.0 for
windows (sas institute, cary, nc).

3. results
3.1. baseline characteristics of the study subjects
there were no significant differences between the control
and  xxxd3524xxx  groups in age, bmi, hba1c, 1,5-ag, pg, iri,
cpr, homa-ir, t-chol, hdl-c, tg, ffa, apob, and
apoe before the study (table 1). the 2 groups did not differ
significantly either in leptin, adiponectin, crp, sicam-1,
svcam-1, and urinary excretion of 8-iso- xxxd1902xxx  and 8ohdg at baseline (table 1).
3.2. effects of  xxxd3524xxx  on glucose and lipid metabolism
no adverse effects of  xxxd3524xxx  were observed during the
entire period of the study. according to the student 2-tailed
t test, the changes in bmi and hba1c in both the control and
 xxxd3524xxx  groups during the study were not significant
(dbmi, p = .367; dhba1c, p = .477). in the control group,
pg, iri, cpr, homa-ir, hdl-c, tg, ffa, apob, and
apoe remained unchanged (table 1). after the  xxxd3524xxx 
treatment, pg, iri, cpr, homa-ir, t-chol, tg, apob,
and apoe were markedly decreased relative to the control
group, although bmi, hba1c, and 1,5-ag were similarly
reduced in both groups (pg, t-chol, tg, apob, and apoe,
p b .01; iri, cpr, and homa-ir, p b .05) (table 1). in
this study, ffa tended to be decreased but did not reach
statistical significance in the  xxxd3524xxx  group (table 1).
3.3. effects of  xxxd3524xxx  on plasma leptin and adiponectin
concentrations
plasma leptin concentrations decreased significantly
in both the control and  xxxd3524xxx  groups (control group,
p b .05;  xxxd3524xxx  group, p b .01). however, plasma adiponectin concentrations were unchanged in both groups
(table 1). neither sex nor the administration of sulfonylureas had any impact on the above parameters in both groups
(data not shown).

breakfast, p b .05; before and after lunch, p b .01) (fig. 1c).
the  xxxd3524xxx  treatment also significantly reduced tg at all
points examined (before and after breakfast and before lunch
and dinner, p b .01; after lunch, p b .05), whereas there were
no appreciable changes in the control group (fig. 1d). free
fatty acid was also significantly reduced after breakfast and
before dinner in the  xxxd3524xxx  group ( p b .01) (fig. 1e),
whereas it was unchanged in the control group.  xxxg175xxx  and apoe were significantly suppressed at all points
examined in the  xxxd3524xxx  group, although there were no
appreciable changes in the control group (fig. 1f and g).
analysis of variance revealed that in the  xxxd3524xxx  group, all
the parameters in the diurnal metabolic profiles were significantly improved after 3 weeks of treatment (cpr, tg, apob,
and apoe, p b .01; pg, iri, and ffa, p b .05), although there
were no significant changes in the control group.
4. discussion
recent epidemiological studies have demonstrated that
postprandial hyperglycemia is an independent risk factor

and a more powerful predictor of cvd than fasting pg
[4,5]. currently, a-glucosidase inhibitors, fast-acting and
short-duration insulin secretagogues, and rapid-acting  xxxd2364xxx  analogues have been widely used to suppress
postprandial hyperglycemia. this may be more efficient for
reducing the risk of cvd in diabetic patients. indeed, the
stop-niddm trial showed that acarbose treatment is
associated with a significantly lower incidence of cvd,
newly diagnosed hypertension, and progression of imt in
subjects with igt [9,10]. it was also shown by metaanalysis that acarbose can prevent myocardial infarction and
cvd in type 2 diabetic patients [11]. furthermore, it was
shown that  xxxd3524xxx  reduces the progression of imt in
japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [19]. here
we investigated whether improving the postprandial state by
 xxxd3524xxx  leads to the reduction of systemic inflammation,
oxidative stress markers, and soluble adhesion molecules in
obese type 2 diabetic patients.
this study is the first demonstration that treatment with
 xxxd3524xxx  for 3 weeks reduces crp, sicam-1, and oxidative
stress markers such as urinary excretion of 8-iso- xxxd1902xxx  and
8-ohdg in parallel with improving postprandial hyperglycemia in obese type 2 diabetic patients. although hba1c was
reduced similarly in both the control and  xxxd3524xxx  groups
during the study, postprandial pg after breakfast and lunch

n. satoh et al. / metabolism clinical and experimental 55 (2006) 786 – 793

791

fig. 1. (continued)

was decreased in the  xxxd3524xxx  group ( p b .01). these
observations suggest that  xxxd3524xxx  is capable of reducing
oxidative stress markers and sicam-1 by improving
postprandial hyperglycemia. because oxidative stress
markers and increased plasma levels of soluble adhesion
molecules have been associated with the development of
cvd [20], it is conceivable that treatment with  xxxd3524xxx 

may lead to the reduction of the risk of cvd in obese type 2
diabetic patients. it has been demonstrated in vitro that
intermittent high glucose enhances oxidative stress generation and icam-1 and  xxxg2406xxx  expression in cultured
human umbilical endothelial cells, where it can induce a
marked increase in cellular apoptosis [21,22]. furthermore,
there are several reports showing that reactive oxygen species

792

n. satoh et al. / metabolism clinical and experimental 55 (2006) 786 – 793

induces expression of adhesion molecules in endothelial cells
both in vivo and in vitro [23,24]. in this study, svcam-1 was
not reduced by the  xxxd3524xxx  treatment, which is consistent
with a previous report that only serum levels of sicam-1, and
not svcam-1, are elevated in diabetic patients without
macroangiopathy [25]. these findings, taken together,
suggest that improving postprandial hyperglycemia by
 xxxd3524xxx  may reduce oxidative stress generation in the
vasculature, thereby leading to the reduction in inflammatory
response in endothelial cells and eventually in vascular
injuries associated with diabetes.
it is well known that both postprandial hyperglycemia
and atherogenic dyslipidemia (impairment of postprandial
chylomicron and very low density lipoprotein metabolism)
are present in type 2 diabetic patients [26]. furthermore,
postprandial hyperlipidemia has been reported to be an
independent risk factor of cvd [27] and a predictor of
carotid imt in type 2 diabetic patients [12]. in this study, we
found that  xxxd3524xxx  reduces significantly fasting tg in
obese type 2 diabetic patients, which is consistent with
previous studies that tg in diabetic patients is reduced by
long-term treatment with acarbose [13,28].  xxxd3524xxx  also
reduced postprandial ffa, and tg, apob, and apoe at all
the points examined in the diurnal profile. in this context,
ceriello et al [23] demonstrated that the impact of combined
postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia on oxidative stress generation and soluble adhesion molecules is
greater than that of postprandial hyperglycemia and
hyperlipidemia independently and suggested an independent
and cumulative effect of postprandial hyperglycemia and
hypertriglyceridemia on endothelial dysfunction in type 2
diabetic patients [29]. we observed a drastic reduction in
remnant-like lipoprotein particle (rlp) cholesterol during
the  xxxd3524xxx  treatment (unpublished observation), which is
consistent with a report by yoshino et al [30] that rlp
cholesterol tends to be decreased in diabetic subjects after 3
months of treatment with acarbose. doi et al [31] also
showed in vitro that rlps can increase expression of
icam-1 and  xxxg2406xxx  in human umbilical endothelial cells
through oxidative stress generation. these observations,
taken together, suggest that reduction of both postprandial
hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia by  xxxd3524xxx  is responsible for the reduction of oxidative stress markers and
sicam-1 in obese type 2 diabetic patients.
there are several potential mechanisms whereby  xxxd3524xxx  treatment can improve diabetic dyslipidemia in this
study. the reduction of hypertriglyceridemia by  xxxd3524xxx 
may be due, at least in part, to a slower rate of hepatic
uptake of dietary carbohydrates, which are key precursors of
de novo lipogenesis [32]. furthermore,  xxxd3524xxx  improved
postprandial hyperinsulinemia; it may also reduce diurnal
insulin secretion by lowering postprandial hyperglycemia
and insulin resistance. because hepatic very low density
lipoprotein secretion is stimulated during chronic hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance [33], a decrease in
postprandial iri may also contribute to the decrease in

tg after the  xxxd3524xxx  treatment. the marked reduction in
diurnal apob and apoe by  xxxd3524xxx  may be related to the
improvement of postprandial hyperinsulinemia and insulin
sensitivity [34], thereby potentially contributing to the
reduction of the risk of cvd [35].
to assess the pathophysiological implication of the
postprandial state as a risk of cvd, most of the previous
studies used challenge meals such as oral glucose tolerance
test or high-fat meal. because we used the standard meals
for diabetic patients, the data of this study may be more
physiologically relevant. in examining the diurnal metabolic
profiles, all patients were instructed to maintain the same
level of energy intake and physical activity for 3 weeks
during hospitalization. although the standard meals were
regularly served during hospitalization, glucose monitoring
throughout the day should be desirable to achieve accurate
diet loading.
in conclusion, this study represents the first demonstration that  xxxd3524xxx  decreases oxidative stress generation and
sicam-1 by improving postprandial hyperglycemia and
hyperlipidemia in obese type 2 diabetic patients, thereby
potentially leading to the reduction of the development of
atherosclerosis and cvd.
