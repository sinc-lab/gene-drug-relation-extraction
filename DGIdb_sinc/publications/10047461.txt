 xxxd3077xxx  ( xxxd3077xxx ) is a specific antifolate-based  xxxg2366xxx  inhibitor active in a variety of solid
tumor malignancies. studies were carried out in vitro
to evaluate downstream molecular alterations induced as a consequence of the potent and sustained
inhibition of  xxxg2366xxx  by  xxxd3077xxx . twenty-four hours following the initial 2-h treatment with
 xxxd3077xxx , human a253 head and neck squamous carcinoma cells, not expressing p53 and p21  xxxg418xxx , were accumulated with dna content characteristic of early s
phase of the cell cycle with a concomitant reduction of
cells in g1 and g2/m phases. the changes in cyclin and
cdk protein expression and their kinase activities
were examined in control and drug-treated a253 cells.
 xxxd3077xxx  treatment resulted in the decrease in p27  xxxg419xxx 
expression, with an increase in cyclin e and  xxxg410xxx  protein expression and kinase activities 24 h after a 2-h
exposure. although  xxxg365xxx  protein expression was
markedly increased,  xxxg365xxx  kinase activity was only
slightly increased.  xxxg366xxx , cyclin b,  xxxg411xxx , and  xxxg407xxx 
protein expression and kinase activities remain constant. lack of activation of  xxxg365xxx – and b–  xxxg407xxx  was
associated with a reduced proportion of cells in g2/m
phases. increased cyclin e–  xxxg410xxx  protein expression
was accompanied by the inhibition of dna synthesis,
with a decrease in  xxxg668xxx  expression. these results
propose that cyclin e–  xxxg410xxx  kinase can negatively regulate dna replication. the studies with  xxxd3364xxx  rescue
from cyclin e–  xxxg410xxx  protein overexpression and
growth inhibition by  xxxd3077xxx  indicate that increased
cyclin e–  xxxg410xxx  protein expression is associated with
effective inhibition of  xxxg2366xxx  and resultant dntp pool imbalance. provision of  xxxd3364xxx 
more than 24 h after exposure to  xxxd3077xxx  allowed

cells to replicate dna for a single cycle back to g1, but
did not prevent the profound growth-inhibitory effect
manifested in the following 5 days.  xxxd3077xxx  treatment resulted in a time-dependent induction of the
megabase dna fragments, followed by secondary 50to 300-kb dna fragmentation. the 50- to 300-kb dna
fragmentation may be derived from the inhibition of
dna synthesis associated with cyclin e–  xxxg410xxx  activation. these results suggest that the megabase dna
fragmentation is induced as a consequence of inhibition of  xxxg2366xxx  by  xxxd3077xxx  and kilobase
dna fragmentation may correlate with the reduction
of p27  xxxg419xxx  expression and the increase in cyclin e and
 xxxg410xxx  kinase activities. activation of cyclin e and  xxxg410xxx 
kinases allows cells to transit from g1 to s phase accompanied by the inhibition of dna synthesis. the
changes in cell cycle regulatory proteins associated
with growth inhibition and dna damage by  xxxd3077xxx 
are not p53 dependent. © 1999 academic press

introduction

 xxxg2366xxx  (ts) 3 is considered an important target for chemotherapy because of its role as the
only de novo source of thymidine nucleotides for dna
synthesis and because it may be rate limiting for dna
synthesis [1]. the combination of 5-fu/cisplatin, which
produces higher responses in head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma (hnscc), has been suggested to
achieve its effect through enhanced ts inhibition [2, 3].
 xxxd3077xxx  ( xxxd3077xxx ) was identified as a potent ts in-

hibitor with cell growth inhibition in vitro [4, 5] and
significant antitumor activity in vivo [4, 6, 7]. as a
specific ts inhibitor,  xxxd3077xxx  may be useful in the
management of hnscc.
the altered expression of the cell cycle genes is one of
the major regulatory mechanisms of cell-growth inhibition [8]. the cell cycle is regulated by the coordinated
action of cdks in association with their specific regulatory cyclin proteins. primary regulators of g1 progression are the d-type cyclins, cyclin e, and  xxxg410xxx , 4, and 6
[9, 10].  xxxg411xxx  and 6 are activated early in g1 by interactions with d-type cyclins [11, 12], whereas  xxxg410xxx  is
activated later in g1 by the interaction with cyclin e
[13, 14] and at the g1/s boundary and throughout s
phase by the interaction with  xxxg365xxx  [15, 16]. thus,
functional activation of both d-cyclin- and e-cyclindependent kinases is required for g1 to s transition
[17–19]. the kinase activity of these binary complexes
is suppressed by cdk inhibitors, including p21  xxxg418xxx  [20,
21], p27  xxxg419xxx  [22, 23], and p57  xxxg420xxx  [24, 25]. preliminary
studies from our laboratory demonstrated a role of
cell-cycle regulators in the growth arrest of a253 cells
in response to dna damage caused by  xxxd3077xxx  [26].
recently, it has been reported that dose- and timedependent induction of dna fragmentation by  xxxd3077xxx  is accompanied by elevation of p53 and p21  xxxg418xxx 
protein expression and rb hypophosphorylation in
hct-8 cells [27]. cell growth arrest by  xxxd3077xxx  in the
cells expressing wild-type p53 may result from p21 waf1mediated inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase activity. interestingly, in human hnscc a253 cells that do
not express any p53 protein,  xxxd3077xxx  treatment also
resulted in growth inhibition and early s-phase arrest
[26]. in the present study, a253 cells were used to
investigate whether changes in cell-cycle regulatory
protein expression and their kinase activities are associated with the growth inhibition induced by the  xxxg2366xxx  inhibitor,  xxxd3077xxx .
materials and methods
drugs and chemicals.  xxxd3077xxx  ( xxxd3077xxx ) was kindly supplied by
zeneca pharmaceuticals (wilmington, de). the compound was dissolved in 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate, ph 8.3,  xxxd1891xxx  mm with final
dilutions made in the growth medium. proteinase k and  xxxg1963xxx 
were obtained from boehringer mannheim corp. (indianapolis, in).
[ 14c] xxxd3364xxx  (sp act 56 mci/mmol) was obtained from moravek biochemicals, inc. (brea, ca). srb,  xxxd3364xxx , and sarkosyl were purchased from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo).
cell line and culture conditions. human a253 head and neck cell
line was purchased from american tissue culture collection (rockville, md) and maintained as monolayer in rpmi 1640 medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (atlanta biologicals,
norcross, ga). the doubling time of the culture is approximately
27 h. all treatments were carried out using exponentially growing
cell cultures. the detection of mycoplasma in cultured cells was
performed using gen-probe mycoplasma t. c. rapid detection
system every 2 months (gen-probe, inc., san deigo, ca) and the

cells were found consistently negative throughout these experiments.
growth inhibition assay. cell growth inhibition was determined
using the total protein srb assay as described elsewhere [28].
briefly, 600 cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates. after 24 h,
exponentially growing a253 cells were treated with  xxxd3077xxx  in
rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine
serum (gibco brl life technologies, grand island, ny) for 2 h. at
four doubling times post-drug exposure, the cells were fixed with 10%
trichloroacetic acid (tca) and further stained according to the published srb procedure. the absorbance was measured at 570 nm
using an automated bio kinetics reader (model el 340; bio-tek
instruments).
cell cycle analysis. exponentially growing cells were exposed to
 xxxd3077xxx  for 2 h, washed twice, and then maintained in drug-free
medium. at the indicated time intervals, the cells were harvested.
approximately 10 6 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of modified krishan buffer (0.1% sodium citrate, 0.02 mg/ml  xxxg1963xxx , 0.37% np-40,
ph 7.4) with  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (0.05 mg/ml; molecular probes, eugene, or) and kept on ice, protected from light, for 30 – 60 min. the
cells were filtered and analyzed for dna content on a facscan flow
cytometer.
western blotting analysis. analysis of p53; p21  xxxg418xxx ; p27  xxxg419xxx ; cyclins d1, e, and a; and  xxxg410xxx  protein expression was performed by
western blot [29]. a253 cells were lysed in ripa buffer (50 mm
tris–hcl, ph 8, 100 mm nacl, 0.5% sds, 0.5% sodium  xxxd1835xxx , 0.5% nonidet p-40, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.4 tiu aprotinin) and the protein
content was determined by the bio-rad dc protein assay. proteins
were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (bio-rad,
hercules, ca). western blotting was performed with the following
antibodies: anti-p53 monoclonal antibody igg 2a (do-1), anti-p21
polyclonal antibody igg (c19), anti-p27 monoclonal antibody igg 1
(f8), anti- xxxg366xxx  polyclonal antibody igg (m20), anti- xxxg365xxx 
monoclonal antibody igg 1 (bf683), anti-cyclin e monoclonal antibody igg 2b ( xxxg699xxx ), anti- xxxg410xxx  polyclonal antibody igg (m2), anticdk4 polyclonal antibody igg (c-22), and anti- xxxg407xxx  polyclonal antibody igg (h-297) (santa cruz biotechnology, inc., santa cruz, ca),
using the renaissance chemiluminescence reagent kit (dupont
nen, boston, ma).
immunoprecipitation and kinase activity assay. immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase activity assay were performed as described
previously with minor modification [30]. briefly, cell pellets were
resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm tris–hcl, ph 7.5, 250 mm nacl,
5 mm edta, ph 8.0, 0.1% nonidet p-40, 5 mm dtt, 10 mm naf, 1
mm pmsf, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mm sodium
orthovanadate) and sonicated twice using the sonic dismembrator
(artek systems corp., farmingdale, ny). after centrifugation,
clarified materials were incubated with protein a agarose (pierce,
rockford, il) for 1 h at 4°c for preclearing in ip buffer (50 mm
hepes, ph 7.5, 150 mm nacl, 2.5 mm egta, 1 mm edta, 1 mm
dtt, and 0.1% tween 20). immunoprecipitations were carried out
with 2.5 mg of the indicated antibody, and immunocomplexes were
recovered with protein a agarose. normal rabbit serum was used as
nonspecific control.
for the cyclin e, a, and b;  xxxg410xxx ; and  xxxg407xxx  kinase assay, the protein
a agarose beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and once
with kinase buffer (50 mm hepes, ph 7.0, 10 mm mgcl, 1 mm dtt,
and 1 mm cold gatp). the washed beads were then incubated with
reaction mixture containing 2 mg histone h1 (boehringer mannheim,
indianapolis, in) and 5 mci of [ 32p]gatp (nen life science products, boston, ma) in 20 ml kinase buffer at 30°c for 20 min. after
incubation, 20 ml of 23 laemmli sample buffer [31] was added to
each sample, followed by sds–page analysis. for the  xxxg366xxx  and
 xxxg411xxx  kinase assay, a gst–rb fusion protein was utilized as a substrate for phosphorylation by anti- xxxg366xxx  and  xxxg411xxx  immunocomplexes, instead of histone h1, and incubated for 30 min at 30°c.

molecular mechanism of cell cycle arrest by  xxxd3077xxx 
dna synthesis assay. cells were plated in duplicate in 24-well
plates and incubated 24 h. they were treated with 1 mm  xxxd3077xxx  for
2 h and then incubated in drug-free medium for indicated periods.
the cultures were labeled for 30 min with 1 mci/ml [6- 3h]durd (sp
act 15 ci/mmol) prior to cell harvest. the cells were washed twice
with ice-cold hbss and resuspended in cold 5% tca. the precipitates were collected on a glass microfiber filter (diameter 2.5 cm;
whatman gf/c) and counted by liquid scintillation counting.
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis. the procedure for preparation of dna plugs is a modification of that by schwartz et al. [32]
and giaccia et al. [33]. approximately 5 3 10 6 cells were washed
using hbss and resuspended in 0.1 ml hbss. an equal volume of
2% low-melting-point agarose prepared in hbss was added at 50°c.
the mixture was immediately poured into the molds. cells embedded in agarose were digested for 24 h in more than 20 vol of lysis
buffer containing 0.5 m edta, ph 8.0, 10 mm tris, 1% sarkosyl, and
1 mg/ml proteinase k and then incubated for 1 h in te buffer (10 mm
tris–hcl, ph 7.4, 1 mm edta) containing 0.2 mg  xxxg1963xxx /ml. each
plug contained approximately 1 3 10 6 cells. agarose gels were prepared in 0.53 brl tbe buffer (75 mm tris, 25 mm boric acid, and
0.1 mm edta, ph 8.9). electrophoresis was carried out using hexa-field horizontal gel electrophoresis apparatus (gibco brl),
which contains a hexagonal array of electrodes having a reorientation angle of 120°. the electrophoresis was performed in tbe buffer
at 14°c with buffer circulation. following electrophoresis, gels were
stained with ethidium bromide (5 mg/ml in h 2o) and then photographed on a uv transilluminator. for quantitative analysis of dna
fragmentation, the cells used were prelabeled with [ 14c] xxxd3364xxx  (0.025
mci/ml) for 24 h. each band was cut out and the quantity of 14clabeled dna was determined by scintillation counting.

results

cell growth inhibition and cell cycle effects
in order to identify the onset of cell-growth inhibition
after a 2-h drug exposure of a253 cells to  xxxd3077xxx ,
kinetics analysis of cell growth was performed. the
data in fig. 1 show that the growth of  xxxd3077xxx -treated
cells was inhibited starting 24 h and persisting up to
96 h after drug removal.
cell-cycle analysis showed that although a slight
change was apparent immediately after 2 h exposure to
1 mm  xxxd3077xxx , accumulation of cells in s phase was
observed optimally at 24 h and persisted at 48 h after
drug exposure (fig. 2).
effect of  xxxd3077xxx  on cyclin, cdk protein expression,
and cdk inhibitors
to begin to ask whether cell cycle regulatory proteins were responsible for the s-phase arrest by  xxxd3077xxx , effects of the agent on cyclin and cdk protein
expression following drug treatment were evaluated.
we found that  xxxd3077xxx  treatment produced a significant increase in cyclin e,  xxxg365xxx , and  xxxg410xxx  protein
expression, detected 24 h after drug removal, with no
detectable changes in  xxxg366xxx , cyclin b,  xxxg411xxx , and
 xxxg407xxx  protein expression (fig. 3).
a number of proteins bind stoichiometrically to cdks
or cyclin/cdk complexes and render the complexes inactive. these inhibitory proteins play a negative regu-

exponentially growing cells were treated with  xxxd3077xxx  for 2 h and

drug exposure. the growth inhibition was determined by the total
protein srb assay as described under materials and methods. symbols represent averages 6 sd of at least three experiments, each

latory role in cell cycle transition, and the disappearance of these inhibitory activities is associated with cell
cycle progression. in order to determine whether cdk
inhibitors p21  xxxg418xxx  and p27  xxxg419xxx  are targets for  xxxd3077xxx 
action, we measured the changes in p21  xxxg418xxx  and p27  xxxg419xxx 
protein expression after exposure of cells to  xxxd3077xxx .
figure 3 shows that the level of p27  xxxg419xxx  protein expression was markedly reduced 24 h after  xxxd3077xxx  treatment, while the control and  xxxd3077xxx -treated a253
cells failed to express a detectable level of p21  xxxg418xxx 
protein (not shown).
characterization of complexes between cyclin e and
 xxxg365xxx  with  xxxg410xxx 
because cyclins and cdks regulate cell cycle by forming complexes with each other, immunoprecipitation
analysis was performed. the partner for cyclin e is
 xxxg410xxx , while the partners for  xxxg365xxx  and b are  xxxg410xxx 
and  xxxg407xxx , respectively. to assess the ability of  xxxg410xxx  to
form complexes with cyclin e and a, complexes between cyclin e with  xxxg410xxx  and  xxxg365xxx  with  xxxg410xxx  were
characterized. as shown in fig. 4, complex formation
between  xxxg410xxx  and cyclin e occurred in tomudextreated a253 cells; however, there was little  xxxg410xxx –
 xxxg365xxx  complex formation.

cytometry. abscissa values are proportionally stained dna content, ordinate values indicate the relative number of cells.

cyclin and cdk activity analysis

 xxxd3364xxx  rescue

since cyclins act by binding to and activating a
series of cdks, we evaluated in vitro cyclin and cdk
kinase activities of the appropriate immunoprecipitates prepared from control and  xxxd3077xxx -treated
a253 cells. the results are as shown in fig. 5. kinase
activities associated with cyclins e, a, and b;  xxxg410xxx ;
and  xxxg407xxx  were assayed using histone h1 as the in
vitro substrate. the data demonstrated that  xxxd3077xxx  treatment potentiated  xxxg410xxx -associated, but not
 xxxg407xxx -associated, kinase activity. we also analyzed
cyclin e-, a-, and b-associated kinase activities and
found that  xxxd3077xxx  significantly increased cyclin
e-associated kinase activity. although  xxxd3077xxx  induced a high level of  xxxg365xxx  protein expression,
 xxxg365xxx -associated kinase activity was not significantly potentiated.  xxxd3077xxx  did not induce cyclin b
overexpression, nor did it potentiate cyclin b-associated kinase activities.  xxxg366xxx - and  xxxg411xxx -associated kinase activities were assayed using a gst–rb
fusion protein as the in vitro substrate. we found
that  xxxg366xxx -associated kinase activity was only
slightly reduced following  xxxd3077xxx  treatment, while
 xxxg411xxx -activity remained constant.

in order to determine if increased cyclin and cdk
protein expression is dependent on effective inhibition
of  xxxg2366xxx  and resultant dntp pool imbalance, the role of  xxxd3364xxx  in the rescue of a253 cells
from cyclin e/ xxxg410xxx  protein expression and growth inhibition was investigated. a noncytotoxic concentration of  xxxd3364xxx  (10 mm) was added to the culture medium at 0 time (immediately after 2 h  xxxd3077xxx 
exposure) or at various times thereafter (4, 8, 16, and
22 h) with cyclin e/ xxxg410xxx  protein expression and growth
inhibition analysis. the data in figs. 6a and 6b indicate that when  xxxd3364xxx  was added at 0 and 4 h after
drug treatment complete prevention of cyclin e/ xxxg410xxx 
protein overexpression and growth inhibition induced
by  xxxd3077xxx  was observed. with a later addition of
 xxxd3364xxx  (8 h and later) the potential for an effective
rescue decreased progressively. no significant rescue
from cyclin e/ xxxg410xxx  protein overexpression or growth
inhibition was achieved if  xxxd3364xxx  was added at 22 h
after 2 h drug exposure. however, even though a late
addition of  xxxd3364xxx  could not prevent growth inhibition,
it did permit the cells to increase their dna content
beyond early s phase (fig. 8b), indicating that dna

(fig. 8a). the data demonstrated that the incorporation of [6- 3h]durd into dna was significantly inhibited
immediately after the start of drug exposure. however,
dna synthesis increased from 0 to 16 h after 2 h drug
exposure, followed by the permanent inhibition. compared to the data shown in fig. 7, the increase in cyclin
e and  xxxg410xxx  protein expression was accompanied by
inhibition of dna synthesis, indicating that dna synthesis is inhibited when cyclin e and  xxxg410xxx  are present
at high concentrations in  xxxd3077xxx -treated cells. addition of  xxxd3364xxx  at 24 h after 2 h exposure to  xxxd3077xxx 
shows that cell cycle distribution has significantly
changed from early s phase to g 2/m phase (fig. 8b).
this indicates that the inhibition of dna synthesis is
not only associated with cyclin e–  xxxg410xxx  activation, but
also with the inhibition of dttp.
pattern analysis of dna fragmentation induced by
 xxxd3077xxx 
to investigate the relationship between the alteration of cyclin e/ xxxg410xxx  protein expression and druginduced dna fragmentation, we analyzed the time
course of  xxxd3077xxx -induced dna fragmentation. figure 9 shows that drug-induced mb dna fragments

2 h, incubated in drug-free medium for an additional 24 h, and then

described under materials and methods. western blot analysis was
performed 24 h after drug removal. fifty micrograms of total cell
extract was separated in 10% sds–page and western blots were
detected with antibodies to cyclins d1, e, a, and b1 as well as  xxxg411xxx ,
 xxxg410xxx ,  xxxg407xxx , and p27  xxxg419xxx .

synthesis per se is not prevented by the change in cell
cycle control proteins and appearance of dna fragmentation.
correlation between cyclin e- xxxg410xxx  and  xxxg668xxx 
expression
 xxxg668xxx  is regulated by a number of proteins, including cdks and their inhibitors [34]. to determine
whether increased cyclin e and  xxxg410xxx  kinase activities
result in alteration of  xxxg668xxx  protein expression, the
kinetics of cyclin e,  xxxg410xxx , and  xxxg668xxx  expression were
measured. the data shown in fig. 7 indicate that the
increased cyclin e and  xxxg410xxx  protein expression induced
by  xxxd3077xxx  was accompanied by a decrease in  xxxg668xxx 
protein expression, which may be responsible for the
inhibition of dna synthesis.

mg of histone h1, as the substrate, was incubated with each immunoprecipitate plus 5 mci [g- 32p]atp for 20 min at 30°c. for gst–rb assay,
1 mg of gst–rb, as the substrate, was incubated with anti- xxxg366xxx  or anti- xxxg411xxx  immunocomplexes plus [g- 32p]atp for 30 min at 30°c. the
reaction mixture was then subjected to sds–page and the extent of histone h1 or gst–rb phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography.

began to appear 8 h after 2 h drug exposure. they
accumulated up to 24 h and then progressively decreased as 50-300 kb dna fragments were formed and
increased. the data suggest that the megabase dna
fragmentation was induced as a consequence of inhibition of  xxxg2366xxx  and the resultant dntp
pool imbalance. the appearance of 50- to 300-kb dna
fragmentation may result from increased cyclin e and
 xxxg410xxx  kinase activities.
discussion

studies of factors that inhibit cell growth have
shown that individual agents may target several components of the cell cycle regulatory apparatus [35–37].
the data from our laboratory have shown that treatment of hct-8 cells, expressing wild-type p53, with
 xxxd3077xxx  results in an accumulation of cells in early s
phase of the cell cycle [38]. recently, our preliminary

observations demonstrated a role of cell cycle regulators in the response to growth arrest and dna damage
by  xxxd3077xxx  in a253 cells with no detectable p53 and
p21  xxxg418xxx  protein expression [26]. in this study, we have
attempted to identify key cell cycle regulatory proteins
and their kinase activities associated with cell cycle
arrest and dna damage by  xxxd3077xxx .  xxxd3077xxx  treatment of a253 cells resulted in growth inhibition starting 24 h and persisting up to 96 h after drug removal
(fig. 1). cell cycle analysis showed little change in cell
cycle distribution immediately after 2 h exposure. the
proportion of cells in early to mid-s phase markedly
increased within 24 h and was sustained for at least
48 h after drug removal with a concomitant reduction
of cells in g1 and g2/m phases (fig. 2).
the fact that  xxxd3077xxx  permits a253 cells to
progress into early s phase and results in s-phase
arrest suggests that alterations of several cell-cycle
regulatory proteins may occur after  xxxd3077xxx  treat-

phase, whereas sw620 cells showed minimal progression into s phase and were arrested at the g1/s boundary. this would seem to indicate that the alterations of
cyclin e-dependent kinase activities play a pivotal role
in controlling the order of events in the cell cycle progression [36].
we do not yet completely understand how alterations of cyclin e and  xxxg410xxx  kinase activities govern the
cell cycle arrest which occurs after  xxxd3077xxx  exposure.
it is also not clear whether  xxxd3077xxx  acts directly or
indirectly through other regulatory factors to increase
cyclin e and  xxxg410xxx  kinase activities. there is evidence
that the regulation of cyclin e and  xxxg410xxx  kinase activities may be associated with phosphatases. several
phosphatases, including cdc25 [39] and protein phosphatases 1 and 2a [40], are known to play a role in
regulation of cdk activity. in addition, the  xxxg415xxx  is also required for the activation of cdk
activity [41, 42].
another possible explanation for the altered cyclin
e–  xxxg410xxx  activity after  xxxd3077xxx  treatment is the regulation of cdk inhibitor expression. the cdk inhibitor
p27  xxxg419xxx  can tightly bind and inhibit the activity of cyclin
e–  xxxg410xxx  [22, 43, 44]. this inhibitor, if present, must
somehow be downregulated before the cyclin e–  xxxg410xxx 
complex can become active. our data show that  xxxd3077xxx  treatment leads to the downregulation of p27  xxxg419xxx 

fig. 6. effect of  xxxd3364xxx  on cyclin e/ xxxg410xxx  expression (a) and
growth inhibition (b) by  xxxd3077xxx . cells were exposed to  xxxd3077xxx 
alone or in combination with 10 mm  xxxd3364xxx  added at 0, 4, 8, 16, and
22 h after the initial 2-h drug treatment. cyclin e and  xxxg410xxx  protein
expression analysis was carried out at 24-h end time point as described for fig. 3. cellular growth inhibition was measured at four
doubling times after drug treatment.

ment. we have found that  xxxd3077xxx  treatment significantly increased cyclin e and  xxxg410xxx  protein expression
and kinase activities in this time frame. although  xxxg365xxx  protein expression was markedly increased,  xxxg365xxx  kinase activity was not potentiated.  xxxd3077xxx 
did not induce  xxxg366xxx –  xxxg411xxx  and cyclin b–  xxxg407xxx  overexpression, nor did it potentiate  xxxg366xxx  and cyclin
b-associated kinase activities. these results indicate
that an increase in cyclin e and  xxxg410xxx  kinase activities
may permit cells to progress into s phase and subsequently cause the accumulation of cells in early s
phase. this is consistent with the previous observation
that although both ht29 and sw620 cell lines exhibited significant increase in cyclin e levels after  xxxd2117xxx 
exposure, only ht29 cells generated increased cyclin
e-dependent kinase activity. with exposure to  xxxd2117xxx ,
ht29 cells progressed into s phase and arrested in s

fig. 8. kinetics of inhibition of dna synthesis by  xxxd3077xxx  (a) and effects of  xxxd3364xxx  on  xxxd3077xxx -induced cell cycle arrest (b). for dna
synthesis study, cells were cultured in 24-well plates and incubated 24 h. this was followed by  xxxd3077xxx  treatment and [6- 3h]durd labeling
as described under materials and methods. the cell pellets were extracted with tca and the precipitates were collected on glass microfiber
filters. the radioactivity incorporated into acid-insoluble fraction was counted by liquid scintillation. for flow cytometry assay, cells were
treated with  xxxd3077xxx  for 2 h and then incubated in drug-free medium. ten micromolar  xxxd3364xxx  was added at 24 h after a 2-h exposure. cell
cycle distribution analysis was carried out as described for fig. 2 at 28, 32, and 36 h following 2 h  xxxd3077xxx  exposure.

protein expression (fig. 6). the results indicate that
the activation of cyclin e–  xxxg410xxx  activity induced by
 xxxd3077xxx , at least in part, correlates with the downregulation of the steady-state level of p27  xxxg419xxx . the cdk
inhibitor p57  xxxg420xxx  may also be associated with the regulation of cyclin e– cdk activity [25].
a253 cells exposed to  xxxd3077xxx  display an increased
activity of  xxxg410xxx  complexed with cyclin e and arrest in s
phase, leading us to propose that cyclin e– xxxg410xxx  activation is responsible for the inhibition of dna synthesis.
the causal relation, if any, could also be the opposite:
s-phase arrest could be the cause rather than consequence of the increased activity of cyclin e– xxxg410xxx  complexes. following the interruption of dna elongation and
the accumulation of dna breaks, as a consequence of ts
inhibition and dttp depletion, the cellular mechanisms
may be oriented to the initiation of dna synthesis. this
process requires cyclin e– xxxg410xxx  activation at the end of
g1 and beginning of s phase, in which a licensing factor
is associated with the origins of replication. on the other
hand, the observed cyclin e– xxxg410xxx  activation could also be
a part of the reaction of the cells to s-phase interruption.
recently, the hypothesis proposed by hua et al. postu-

lates that  xxxg410xxx –cyclin e kinase complex may play a critical role in negatively regulating dna replication during
the cell cycle [45, 46]. high  xxxg410xxx  activity prevents reinitiation of dna synthesis in the absence of an intervening
period of low cdk activity in postmitotic cells. the cells
arrested in s phase by  xxxd3077xxx  do not reinitiate dna
synthesis as there could be no such intervening period.
moreover, with respect to how this negative regulation
occurs, the authors suggested that high concentration of
 xxxg410xxx –cyclin e prevents mcm3, a licensing factor for
dna replication, from reassociating with chromatin after
replication. in our study, the increase in cdk protein
expression and kinase activity was accompanied by the
inhibition of dna synthesis (figs. 7 and 8), while  xxxg365xxx 
activity remained at low levels. it could not be ruled out
that the low activity of  xxxg410xxx  complexed with  xxxg365xxx 
could again be either the cause or the consequence of the
interrupted dna synthesis. since dna synthesis is permitted when thymidine is added to the medium, even if
such addition is delayed long enough to prevent rescue
from growth inhibition, it is apparent that the changes in
cell cycle control proteins and damage to dna are not
simply preventing dna synthesis immediately after to-

nificantly increased with a concomitant decrease in
dttp pool as a consequence of ts inhibition after  xxxd3077xxx  exposure [47]. this imbalance in the dutp/
dttp pool ratio may lead to primary megabase dna
fragmentation. addition of  xxxd3364xxx  reverses the effects
of  xxxd3077xxx  until the moment when megabase dna
fragments become detectable (8 h), underlining the fact
that it is not  xxxd3077xxx  itself but the depletion of dttp
and its consequences which induce cell cycle arrest.
activation of cyclin e–  xxxg410xxx  kinases and the inhibition
of dna synthesis was accompanied by secondary 50- to
300-kb dna fragmentation (figs. 8 and 9), which
might be associated with apoptosis [48, 49]. it is possible that cyclin e–  xxxg410xxx  is necessary for chromatin
condensation and other morphological changes associated with apoptosis. however, this suggestion should
be confirmed in the future.
in summary, the results reported herein demonstrated marked effects of  xxxd3077xxx  on the expression of
several key cell cycle regulatory proteins and their
kinase activities.  xxxd3077xxx -induced megabase dna
fragmentation associated with effective inhibition of
 xxxg2366xxx  may correlate to the reduction of
p27  xxxg419xxx  expression, with the increase in cyclin e and
 xxxg410xxx  kinase activities. the activation of cyclin e and
 xxxg410xxx  kinases allows cells to transit from g1 to s, and
subsequently results in an arrest in early s phase,
apparently due to a shortage of thymidylate. however,
alleviation of the shortage of thymidylate, if it occurs
after these changes in cell cycle proteins and the appearance of dna damage, does not prevent the potent
growth inhibitory effect. therefore, mechanisms other
than simple inhibition of the dna replicative machinery 24 h after  xxxd3077xxx  exposure, must be involved.

mudex induced damage. that is, the growth inhibition is
effective even if the cells are permitted to transit s phase
once beyond  xxxd3077xxx  exposure. thus, it is possible that
the activation of cyclin e– xxxg410xxx  kinase activities may play
a dual role in regulating cell cycle, namely, promoting
transition from g1 to s phase and negatively regulating
dna replication in s phase.
