mechanisms for t-cell selective cytotoxicity of arabinosylguanine.   xxxd2707xxx , prodrug of arabinosylguanine (ara-g), has demonstrated t-lymphoblastic antileukemic activity in cell lines and in the clinic. to investigate the mechanism for lineage-specific toxicity, the effects of ara-g were compared in cem (t-lymphoblast), raji (b-lymphoblast), and  xxxg1167xxx  (myeloid) cell lines. cem cells were the most sensitive to ara-g-induced apoptosis and accumulated the highest levels of ara-g triphosphate (ara-gtp). however, compared with myeloid and b-lineage cell lines, cem cells incorporated fewer ara-g molecules-which were at internucleotide positions in all 3 cell lines- into dna. ara-g induced an s-phase arrest in both raji and  xxxg1167xxx , while in cem the s-phase cells decreased with a concomitant increase in the sub-g1 population. within 3 hours of ara-g treatment, the levels of soluble  xxxd3135xxx  (sfasl) in the medium increased significantly in cem cultures. in parallel, an induction of fasl gene expression was observed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). pretreatment of cem cells with a fas antagonistic antibody inhibited ara-g-mediated cell death. these results demonstrate that high ara-gtp accumulation in t cells results in an s phase-dependent apoptosis induced by ara-g incorporation into dna, which may lead to a t cell-specific signal for the induction and liberation of sfasl. subsequently, the sfasl induces an apoptotic response in neighboring non-s-phase cells. in contrast, myeloid and b cells accumulated lower levels of ara-gtp and arrested in s phase, blocking any apoptotic signaling.
