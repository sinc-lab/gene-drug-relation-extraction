role of  xxxg649xxx  in the metabolism of glutathione and its conjugates in the rat kidney.  14c- xxxd2684xxx -s-cysteinylglycine was used to investigate the role of  xxxg649xxx  in the metabolism of glutathione conjugates. the dipeptide was rapidly hydrolyzed to 14c- xxxd2684xxx -s-cysteine in isolated rat renal cells, and subsequently acetylated to 14c- xxxd2684xxx -s- xxxd68xxx .  xxxd1693xxx , a specific inhibitor of  xxxg649xxx , strongly inhibited the hydrolysis of the dipeptide by the isolated cells. in rat kidney homogenates, the marked inhibitory effect of  xxxd1693xxx  was also observed on the hydrolysis of cystinyl-bis-glycine and leukotriene d4, which are dipeptide intermediates in the biotransformation of  xxxd2811xxx  and endogenous glutathione conjugate, respectively. in contrast, the inhibitory effect of  xxxd3463xxx , a potent inhibitor of aminopeptidase-m, was much smaller than that of  xxxd1693xxx  on the hydrolysis of these dipeptides by the renal cells and homogenates. these results suggest that  xxxg649xxx  plays a more important role in the metabolism of glutathione and its conjugates than aminopeptidase-m does.
