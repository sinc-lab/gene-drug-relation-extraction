abstract
metabolites of the analogue 1-deamino-1-carba-2-tyrosinež o-methyl.-oxytocin žcarbetocin. following incubation with a rat kidney
homogenate were isolated and their pharmacodynamic properties investigated. apart from the parent compound two metabolites were
identified namely desglynh 2- xxxd434xxx  žcarbetocin  xxxd2815xxx . and desleuglynh 2- xxxd434xxx  žcarbetocin metabolite ii.. both
 xxxd434xxx ,  xxxd434xxx   xxxd2815xxx  and  xxxd434xxx  metabolite ii displayed binding affinities to the myometrial  xxxg1642xxx  of a
similar magnitude as oxytocin.  xxxd434xxx  was found to have agonistic properties on isolated myometrial strips and it was found to exert
this effect through generation of inositol phosphates, as is the case for oxytocin. however, maximal contractile effect of  xxxd434xxx  was
approximately 50% lower than that of oxytocin ž2.70 " 0.12 g compared to 5.22 " 0.26 g. and ec 50 was approximately ten times higher
ž48.0 " 8.20 nm compared to 5.62 " 1.22 nm.. neither  xxxd434xxx   xxxd2815xxx  nor  xxxd434xxx  metabolite ii were able to contract isolated
myometrial tissue. all three compounds displayed antagonistic properties against oxytocin in vitro, with  xxxd434xxx  being the strongest
inhibitor žp a 2 s 8.21. and  xxxd434xxx  metabolite ii žp a 2 s 8.01. being stronger than  xxxd434xxx   xxxd2815xxx  žp a 2 s 7.81.. these results
indicate that  xxxd434xxx  is a partial agonistrantagonist to the  xxxg1642xxx  while the two metabolites  xxxd434xxx   xxxd2815xxx  and
 xxxd434xxx  metabolite ii are pure antagonists. all three analogues bound to the myometrial vasopressin v1 receptor, albeit with much
lower affinities than to the  xxxg1642xxx .  xxxd434xxx  metabolite ii showed the weakest binding affinity of 33.7 " 7.34 nm compared
to 7.24 " 0.29 nm for  xxxd434xxx  and 9.89 " 2.80 nm for  xxxd434xxx   xxxd2815xxx . only  xxxd434xxx  bound to the renal vasopressin v2
receptor though the binding affinity was very low ž61.3 " 14.6 nm.. q 1998 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
 xxxd434xxx  žfig. 1. is an alkylated carba-analogue of
1-deamino-oxytocin ž1-deamino-1-carba-2-tyrosine ž omethyl.-oxytocin., which has been shown to have both
milk ejecting and uterotonic activity žbarth et al., 1975..
due to its short half-life oxytocin used for induction of
labour needs to be infused intravenously to obtain sustained myometrial activity.  xxxd434xxx  has a long half-life
ž85–100 min. žcort et al., 1981. compared to that of
oxytocin ž3.4 min. žgazis, 1978. and vasopressin ž1.6–8.0

is therefore considered being used in human subjects for
the control of uterine atony and excessive bleeding after
delivery by caesarean section. indeed in post partum
women hunter et al. ž1992. found intramuscular administration of  xxxd434xxx  to be superior to the intravenously
route concerning the duration of uterotonic action. in
addition they observed only minimal side effects of the
treatment.
in spite of the molecular differences between oxytocin
and  xxxd434xxx  previous studies have shown, that the two
peptides bind to myometrial plasma membranes with receptor affinities in the same order of magnitude žatke and
vilhardt, 1987.. the structural modifications made in the
n-terminal part of the  xxxd434xxx  molecule protect the
molecule from aminopeptidase and disulphidase cleavage.

2. materials and methods
2.1. materials
female wistar rats ž250–350 g. used for binding and
contraction studies were bred and maintained under controlled conditions in the panum institute animal house.
food and water were freely available. sprague–dawley
rats used for preparation of kidney homogenates were
obtained from møllegaard žejby, denmark..
 xxxd434xxx , oxytocin,  xxxd434xxx   xxxd2815xxx  and  xxxd434xxx  metabolite ii prepared by solid phase synthesis were
obtained from ferring žmalmo,
¨ sweden.. w3 hxoxytocin and
3
w hxvasopressin were purchased from new england nuclear žboston, ma, usa. and w3 hxinositol was from
amersham žnorth chicago, il, usa.. all other chemicals
were of analytical grade.
2.2. preparation of rat kidney homogenate
kidneys from 10 rats were cut in small pieces and
homogenized on ice in a 25 mm sodium-phosphate buffer
žph 6.5. containing 1 mm edta. subsequently the homogenate was centrifuged 20 000 = g av for 30 min at 48c.
the resulting supernatant was aliquoted and store frozen
žy208c..
2.3. identification of  xxxd434xxx  metabolites

fig. 1. chemical structures of oxytocin,  xxxd434xxx  and  xxxd434xxx 
metabolites i and ii.

the living organism does, however, posses a number of
enzymes capable of degrading carba-analogues at the cterminal end of the molecule žbarth et al., 1969; suskabrzezinska et al., 1972.. in this context the kidneys constitute important sites for peptide metabolism.
the prolonged uterotonic activity of  xxxd434xxx  is proposed to be a result of an increased stability žvilhardt et
al., 1997.. mitchell et al. ž1997. have demonstrated that
oxytocin incubated with a cytosolic fraction of uterine
homogenates is primarily degraded by post-proline endopeptidase activity, whereas the particulate fraction contained predominantly aminopeptidase activity.
in the present study, the aim was to identify the metabolites of  xxxd434xxx  following incubation with a kidney
homogenate and to describe the pharmacological properties of the compounds as to binding of the metabolites to
oxytocin receptors and to vasopressin v1 and vasopressin
v2 receptors. in addition agonistic and antagonistic effects
of the metabolites on myometrial contractility were investigated.

6.25 ml  xxxd434xxx  ž5 mm. was pre-incubated for 5 min
at 378c in 23.75 ml 25 mm sodium-phosphate buffer, ph
6.5 containing 1 mm edta. thereafter 1.25 ml kidney
homogenate was added. following further 100 min incubation the enzymatic reaction was stopped by addition of
62.5 ml ice-cold 2% znso4 in methanolrwater ž1:1.. the
reaction mixture was kept on ice for 10 min. after centrifugation ž5 min, 10,000 = g av , 48c. the supernatant was
evaporated and re-dissolved in acidified water. pre-purification was made using a sep-pak c18 column to remove
impurities, which could shorten the lifetime of the semipreparative column used for separation of the metabolites.
the sep-pak eluent was analyzed by high pressure liquid
chromatography žhplc. using a kromasil žc8. column
with an acetonitrilrtriflouroacetic acid gradient to separate
metabolites. amino acid analysis and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry žfab-ms. was employed to
determine the structure of each metabolite.
2.4. preparation of plasma membranes
preparation of rat myometrial plasma membranes was
performed as described žengstrøm et al., 1988a.. two days
prior to decapitation the animals received an i.m. injection
of 75 mg  xxxd2037xxx -benzoate žengstrøm et al., 1998..

t. engstrøm et al.r european journal of pharmacology 355 (1998) 203–210

myometrial tissue was homogenised followed by centrifugation 100 = g av ž10 min, 48c.. the supernatant was
re-centrifuged 10 000 = g av ž10 min, 48c. and the resulting
supernatant centrifuged 113 000 = g av ž30 min, 48c.. the
sediment from the 113 000 = g av centrifugation was resuspended in 10% sucrose and placed on top of a 28%
sucrose solution. following centrifugation at 112 000 = g av
ž120 min, 48c. the layer between the two sucrose solutions
was carefully pipetted off, washed with distilled water and
finally resuspended in distilled water to concentrations of
0.5–1.0 mgrml. an aliquot was taken for protein determination according to lowry et al. ž1951.. electron microscopy was done to ensure that the preparation consisted
of purified plasma membranes žfig. 2..
rat kidney plasma membranes were isolated using the
technique described by fitzpatrick et al. ž1969.. medullary
renal tissue was dissected on ice and minced with a pair of
scissors. the tissue was homogenized in 3 volumes of 0.25
m sucrose–1 mm edta followed by centrifugation at
1.475 = g av for 10 min at 48c. the sediment was resuspended in 2 m sucrose, re-homogenized and re-centrifuged
at 13,300 = g av for 10 min at 48c. the supernatant of the
13 300 = g av centrifugation was diluted to isotonicity by
the addition of 7-volume cold distilled h 2 o and was
centrifuged at 35 000 = g av for 15 min at 48c. the resulting pellet consisted of an upper pink layer of membranes

205

and a lower brown layer. the upper layer was removed by
swirling isotonic sucrose over the pellet. following homogenization the resulting suspension was centrifuged
three times at 35 000 = g av for 15 min at 48c with homogenizations in between each. the final pellet was aliquoted
and the protein content measured žlowry et al., 1951..
2.5. binding assays
receptor binding to myometrial or kidney plasma membranes was performed as described earlier with some
modifications žengstrøm et al., 1988a.. membranes were
incubated for 60 min in 250 ml of a medium containing 50
mm tris–maleate žph 7.6., 10 mm mncl 2 with concentrations of w3 hxoxytocin varying from 0.42 to 24.20 nm or
concentrations of w3 hxvasopressin varying from 0.09 to
5.40 nm. the assay was performed at room temperature
and was initiated by the addition of plasma membranes. at
the end of the incubation period bound ligand was separated from unbound by filtration. specific binding of 3 hligand was calculated by subtraction of binding in the
presence of a 1000-fold excess of unlabelled hormone and
was finally related to protein concentration. linear regressions of double reciprocal plots were used to calculate
dissociation constants of the receptor binding of
w3 hxoxytocin and w3 hxvasopressin. r 2-values of these re-

gressions varied from 0.92 to 0.97. scatchard plots were
alternatively drawn. these gave k d-values comparable to
those obtained from double reciprocal plots ždata not
shown.. receptor binding of  xxxd434xxx ,  xxxd434xxx 
 xxxd2815xxx  and  xxxd434xxx  metabolite ii was measured as
displacement of specifically bound w3 hxvasopressin or
w3 hxoxytocin. concentrations of unlabelled ligand over
ranges of 0.8 nm–1.0 mm žcarbetocin., 8.0 nm–1.0 mm
žcarbetocin  xxxd2815xxx . or 0.8 nm–1.0 mm žcarbetocin
metabolite ii. were incubated in the presence of 1.56 nm
w3 hxoxytocin or 1.08 nm w3 hxvasopressin. the resulting
binding of labelled peptide was expressed as a percentage
of the binding in the absence of unlabelled peptide and
was plotted against the logarithm of the concentration of
unlabelled peptide. according to levitzki ž1980., dissociation constants of the unlabelled peptides could subsequently be calculated from the concentrations needed to
displace 50% of receptor bound w3 hxpeptide:

2.6. in õitro contractility of isolated uterine strips
in vitro contractility of isolated uterine strips was measured basically as described previously žengstrøm et al.,
1988b.. two days prior to decapitation the animals received an i.m. injection of 75 mg  xxxd2037xxx -benzoate. one
uterine horn was opened longitudinally and a middle segment measuring 5 mm was mounted in an isometric myograph connected to a grass force transducer. the resting
tension was adjusted to 1.0 g. the strip was placed in an
organ bath containing 8 ml of munsick’s buffer, ph 7.4
žmunsick, 1960. and allowed to rest for 30 min. the
temperature was kept at 308c and the solution constantly
aerated with 5% co 2 in o 2 . agonistic effects on the
myometrium of oxytocin,  xxxd434xxx ,  xxxd434xxx  metabolite
i and  xxxd434xxx  metabolite ii were evaluated from individual dose–response curves. oxytocin was added at concentrations over the range of 0.25 = 10y9 –0.25 = 10y6 m.
 xxxd434xxx ,  xxxd434xxx   xxxd2815xxx  and  xxxd434xxx  metabolite ii were added over concentration ranges of 0.13 =
10y9 –14.0 = 10y6 m. upon addition of each dose the
amplitude of the contractile response was recorded. three
washings with buffer followed each stimulation.
the antagonistic effects of  xxxd434xxx ,  xxxd434xxx 
 xxxd2815xxx  and  xxxd434xxx  metabolite ii were evaluated
by obtaining cumulative dose–response curves for oxytocin in the presence of the peptides at concentrations of 1
and 10 nm žcarbetocin. or 10, 20, 50 and 100 nm
žcarbetocin  xxxd2815xxx  and  xxxd434xxx  metabolite ii..

2.7. myometrial inositol phosphate production
rats received 75 mg  xxxd2037xxx -benzoate two days prior
to decapitation. myometrial tissue pieces ž1 = 1 mm. were
incubated for 3 h in krebs–ringer buffer, ph 7.4, 378c
containing 10 mci w3 hxmyoinositolrml and 0.1% bsa.
thereafter the tissue was rinsed four times with 5 ml of
krebs–ringer buffer with 0.1% bsa and was allowed to
rest in this buffer for 10 min at 378c. the tissue was then
incubated for 10 min at 378c in krebs–ringer buffer
containing 0.1% bsa and 10 mm licl in the absence of
w3 hxmyoinositol. subsequently the tissue was stimulated
with 20 mm oxytocin or 20 mm  xxxd434xxx  for 10 min at
378c in krebs–ringer buffer containing 10 mm licl and
0.1% bsa. the reactions were stopped by the addition of
an equal volume of ice-cold 10% žvrv. perchloric acid.
the samples were placed on ice for 20 min and were
intensively whirled every 5 min to liberate inositol phosphates. the resulting suspension was centrifuged 2000 =
g av for 5 min, 48c. ten mm edta was added to the
supernatant and inositol phosphates were extracted using a
tri-n-octylaminrfreon ž1:1. gradient. inositol phosphates
were subsequently separated from remaining w3 hxinositol
and quantitated by hplc on an anion-exchange column
žmono q. using a combined ammonium formaterph gradient.
2.8. data analysis
myometrial contractions were recorded by means of a
data acquisition system žbiopac systems, wpi, usa.. a
computer program žfig. p., biosoft, cambridge, uk. was
used for analysis of binding assays and contractile experiments. one-way analysis of variance was used to compare means of multiple groups. pair-wise comparisons of
means were done by means of student’s t-test or the
mann–whitney test. p - 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

3.2. binding assays
binding of w3 hxoxytocin and w3 hxvasopressin to myometrial plasma membranes and binding of w3 hxvasopressin to
kidney membranes followed michaelis–menten kinetics.
double reciprocal plots and scatchard plots revealed only
one myometrial binding site for oxytocin and only one
binding site for vasopressin to myometrial plasma membranes and kidney membranes respectively. non-specific
binding accounted for approximately 50% of the total
binding and consisted primarily of filter binding. k d
values of the receptor binding of w3 hxoxytocin and
w3 hxvasopressin were in the nanomolar range žtable 1.. k d
values of  xxxd434xxx ,  xxxd434xxx   xxxd2815xxx  and  xxxd434xxx  metabolite ii were calculated from displacement

4. discussion
due to its increased duration of action in vivo žhunter
et al., 1992. and in vitro žatke and vilhardt, 1987.  xxxd434xxx  is intended to be used in human subjects for the
control of uterine atony and excessive bleeding after delivery by caesarean section and has already been registered as
a drug in the uk and canada že. de witt, ferring pharmaceuticals, personal communication.. the present study
shows that  xxxd434xxx  in an in vitro model using kidney
homogenates is degraded enzymatically by c-terminal
cleavage leaving  xxxd434xxx   xxxd2815xxx  and by further
cleavage of  xxxd434xxx   xxxd2815xxx  leaving  xxxd434xxx 
metabolite ii. the precise species of enzymes involved in
the degradation of  xxxd434xxx  is not known, except that
they are carboxypeptidases, possibly of chymotryptic nature, since vilhardt et al. ž1997. have shown that incubation of  xxxd434xxx  with that enzyme leads to the formation

209

of  xxxd434xxx   xxxd2815xxx . oxytocin itself may be a substrate for the enzymes involved in the degradation of
 xxxd434xxx . however, oxytocin is also degraded in the
n-terminal part of the molecule by aminopeptidases
žmitchell et al., 1997. and this fact may partly explain the
shorter half-life of oxytocin.
the data show that both  xxxd434xxx ,  xxxd434xxx   xxxd2815xxx  and  xxxd434xxx  metabolite ii display binding affinity
to myometrial oxytocin receptors in the same order of
magnitude as is known for oxytocin žatke and vilhardt,
1987.. all three test substances also bound to the vasopressin v1 receptor, albeit with much lower affinities,
 xxxd434xxx  metabolite ii being the weakest ligand. the
affinity of  xxxd434xxx  to vasopressin v2 receptors was very
low and  xxxd434xxx   xxxd2815xxx  and  xxxd434xxx  metabolite
ii had no affinity at all for these receptors. these findings
for oxytocin analogous are not unexpected, since oxytocin
itself has low vasopressor žvasopressin v1 receptors. and
low antidiuretic žvasopressin v2 receptors. activities žberde
and boissonnas, 1968..
in agreement with earlier observations žatke and vilhardt, 1987. the contractile effect of  xxxd434xxx  on isolated
uterine strips was weaker than that of oxytocin both as to
emax and ec 50 . the generation of myometrial inositol
phosphates following stimulation confirmed that the two
peptides activate the same intracellular second messenger
system to approximately the same extent. nevertheless, the
reduced maximal contractile response to  xxxd434xxx  indicates weaker activation of the  xxxg1642xxx  to this
peptide compared to oxytocin in spite of equal binding
affinities for the two ligands. increased ec 50 values from
uterine strips exposed to  xxxd434xxx  suggest that the coupling between receptor occupancy and contractile response
is also weaker than that for oxytocin. both  xxxd434xxx ,
 xxxd434xxx   xxxd2815xxx  and  xxxd434xxx  metabolite ii displayed antagonistic properties against the contractile effect
of oxytocin, with  xxxd434xxx  being the strongest inhibitor
and  xxxd434xxx  metabolite ii being stronger than  xxxd434xxx 
 xxxd2815xxx . since  xxxd434xxx  displays high affinity to the
 xxxg1642xxx  it was not unexpected, that this compound should have antagonistic properties against oxytocin. in this context the question could be raised, whether
 xxxd434xxx  through a potential blockade of endogenous
oxytocin at its receptor site might be an inexpedient compound in the control of uterine atony. although a weaker
agonist than oxytocin,  xxxd434xxx  has, however, been reported to effectively induce contractions in the human
uterus žhunter et al., 1992. and it must be kept in mind
that the effect of endogenous oxytocin appears inadequate
when uterine atony is present suggesting low plasma concentrations of the hormone. furthermore, the long half-life
and few side effects of  xxxd434xxx  make it a useful uterotonic agent. desglycinamide-oxytocin is devoid of agonistic action žbarth et al., 1967. and therefore, as shown in
the present paper, it was expected that the same held true
for  xxxd434xxx   xxxd2815xxx  and  xxxd434xxx  metabolite ii.

that  xxxd434xxx   xxxd2815xxx  and  xxxd434xxx  metabolite ii
possessed rather potent antagonistic properties is in agreement with similar findings for c-terminal shortened analogous of oxytocin žmelin and trojnar, 1988..
5. conclusion
in conclusion we have shown, that  xxxd434xxx  upon
incubation with a kidney extract is degraded at the cterminal leaving metabolites desglynh 2- xxxd434xxx  and
desleuglynh 2- xxxd434xxx , which both show affinity to the
myometrial  xxxg1642xxx  with almost identical binding affinities as the genuine ligand itself. both  xxxd434xxx 
 xxxd2815xxx  and  xxxd434xxx  metabolite ii showed potent
antagonistic properties against oxytocin and might therefore be expected to be potential blockers of the agonistic
effect of  xxxd434xxx . however, clinical experiments žhunter
et al., 1992. demonstrate a marked uterotonic effect of
 xxxd434xxx , indicating that  xxxd434xxx   xxxd2815xxx  and
 xxxd434xxx  metabolite ii may be more short-lived than the
metabolically stable  xxxd434xxx  with an in vivo half-life of
85–100 min žcort et al., 1981. or may be excreted at a
higher rate.
