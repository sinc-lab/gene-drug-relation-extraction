re-evaluation of  xxxd2498xxx  pharmacology:
5-hydroxytryptamine1a receptor-mediated behavioral effects overlap
its other properties in rats
received: 11 february 2002 / accepted: 29 april 2002 / published online: 19 july 2002

abstract rationale: there is substantial evidence that
 xxxd2498xxx  can produce effects linked to  xxxg1108xxx 
occupancy. nevertheless, this action has generally been
ignored in the mechanism of action of  xxxd2498xxx , in favor of
an exclusive role for dopamine receptors in considering
its antiparkinsonian effects, or an exclusive role of 5ht2a/2c receptor activation in hallucinogenesis. these
conclusions are surprising when one considers that the
potent interaction of  xxxd2498xxx  with 5-ht1a receptors has
been demonstrated in several different laboratories and
that activation of 5-ht1a and 5-ht1b receptors can
modulate dopaminergically mediated responses. objective: the lack of full substitution of  xxxd2498xxx  for lysergic
acid diethylamide (lsd) in drug discrimination experiments and induction of a pronounced 5-ht syndrome by
this compound at relatively low doses convinced us to
execute two series of experiments that might explain the
primary mechanism responsible for  xxxd2498xxx -mediated
biological effects and its paradoxical classification as a
dopamine agonist in the literature. results: in drug
discrimination studies,  xxxd2498xxx  fully mimicked the  xxxg1108xxx  agonist ly 293284, only partially substituted for
lsd and doi, and failed to substitute for (+)-amphetamine.  xxxd2498xxx  produced a significant dose-related
increase in flat body posture, forepaw treading, and
lower-lip retraction which reflect a modulation of behavior by action at central 5-ht1a receptors. only pmppi [4iodo-n-[2-[4-(methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-n-2pyridynyl-benzamide hydrochloride], a selective 5-ht1a
antagonist, was effective in inhibiting all 5-ht syndrome

behaviors produced by  xxxd2498xxx , whereas pmppi was
without effect on any behavior induced by lsd.  xxxd2498xxx 
dose dependently decreased body temperature in rats with
a potency similar to that of the selective 5-ht1a agonist
ly 293284. the hypothermic effect of  xxxd2498xxx  was
prevented by pre-injection of pmppi, but not by  xxxd2419xxx  or haloperidol. conclusion: we have demonstrated that the behavioral effects of low doses of  xxxd2498xxx  are
clearly mediated by stimulation of 5-ht1a receptors.

introduction
 xxxd2498xxx  is a semi-synthetic ergot derivative that was first
used clinically as an anti-migraine agent (zikan and
siemonsky 1960). several authors have described  xxxd2498xxx 
as a nonaddictive ergot derivative that stimulates postsynaptic dopamine receptors (horowski and wachtel
1976; rosenfeld and makman 1981; uzumaki et al. 1982;
schechter 1984; cunningham et al. 1987a). historically,
in low doses,  xxxd2498xxx  has been shown to induce locomotor
inhibition and contralateral circling in rats with 6hydroxydopamine (6-oh-da) unilateral lesions of the
substantia nigra and, in higher doses, locomotor stimulation, stereotypies, mounting behavior, and signs of the
“serotonin syndrome” (horowski and wachtel 1976; fuxe
et al 1978; pieri et al 1978; wachtel 1978; sielbergeld
and hruska 1979; marini et al. 1981). because dopamine
antagonists reversed these behavioral effects, it was
suggested early on that  xxxd2498xxx  acts as a dopamine
agonist (horowski and wachtel 1976; wachtel 1978).
nevertheless, the doses of  xxxd2498xxx  that consistently
produced dopaminergic effects were extremely high and
had little, if any, relevance to doses that produce effects

94

on the firing of central nervous system (cns) neurons or
induce selectively mediated behavioral syndromes.
not surprisingly,  xxxd2498xxx  was found to possess therapeutic efficacy in extrapyramidal disorders and neuroendocrine disturbances in which some dysfunction of the
central dopaminergic system is postulated to exist
(horowski and wachtel 1976; schecter 1984; wachtel
1991). the addition of  xxxd2498xxx  to a levodopa regimen in a
parkinsonian disability resulted in a therapeutic response
superior to that achieved with levodopa alone, significantly decreased and postponed the development of motor
fluctuations and end-of-dose failure and dyskinesias
(montastruc et al. 1999; rinne 1999), and allowed a
reduced dosage of levodopa (allain et al. 2000). thus, the
vast majority of published literature has discussed  xxxd2498xxx 
in the context of its dopaminergic effects.
 xxxd2498xxx , however, is not simply a dopamine agonist,
but possesses affinity for a variety of central monoamine
receptors that include not only dopamine but also
serotonin and adrenergic receptors (white 1986; hoyer
1987, 1988; hoyer and schoeffter 1991; leysen 1992;
sundaram et al. 1995; piercey et al. 1996; egan et al.
2000). moreover, careful examination of the descriptive
accounts of  xxxd2498xxx -induced stereotypies indicates that
many of the individual behaviors are now considered to
be components of the 5-ht syndrome. although the
locomotor effects of  xxxd2498xxx  were historically considered
to be solely linked to its dopamine agonist properties,
investigators rarely took into account the actions of
 xxxd2498xxx  on central serotonergic systems (wachtel 1978;
carruba and mantegazza 1983; wachtel 1983; adams
and geyer 1985), although a few were cognizant of this
pharmacology. for example, fink and morgenstern
(1985) concluded that the locomotor effects of  xxxd2498xxx 
reflect a complex interaction between dopaminergic and
serotonergic systems.
another focus of interest in  xxxd2498xxx  has been its close
structural similarity to the potent hallucinogenic agent
 xxxd2527xxx  (lsd), differing from lsd
only in the addition of an amino function at the 8 position
(nichols 1976; white 1986). since hofmann’s discovery
of the potent hallucinogenic actions of lsd in 1943
(hoffman 1975), researchers have attempted to elucidate
the neuropharmacological changes that cause, or at least
correlate with, the behavioral and perceptual manifestations characteristic of the lsd experience (herrmann
1977).  xxxd2498xxx  has been of considerable importance
because of its strikingly similar pharmacological profile
to lsd but lack of lsd-like hallucinogenic activity in
man.
mokler et al. (1983) reported that  xxxd2498xxx  was almost
three times more potent than lsd in disrupting fixed-ratio
(fr) performance. interestingly, 5-ht antagonists, but
not dopamine antagonists, blocked the effects of both
lsd and  xxxd2498xxx . sielbergeld and hruska (1979) found
that both  xxxd2498xxx  and lsd induced signs of the “serotonin
syndrome”, but  xxxd2498xxx  was more potent. pretreatment
with haloperidol potentiated and prolonged the lsd-

induced syndrome but had no effect on  xxxd2498xxx -induced
behavior.
early data from drug discrimination studies suggested
that  xxxd2498xxx  exerts many pharmacological effects that are
similar to those of its hallucinogenic congener, lsd
(white and appel 1981, 1982a, 1982b; holohean et al.
1982; mokler et al. 1983) and to a hallucinogenic
phenethylamine 5-ht2a agonist, dom (glennon and
hauck 1985). although lsd and  xxxd2498xxx  produce similar
effects in rats, the neuronal substrates of these effects can
be differentiated using drug versus drug discrimination
procedures. from these and other studies it was concluded
that dopamine receptor activation plays a prominent role
in the discriminative stimulus effects of  xxxd2498xxx , but only
a secondary role in the lsd cue. thus, for example,
callahan and appel (1990) later confirmed the suggestion
that the stimulus effects of lsd and  xxxd2498xxx  are mediated
by different mechanisms: the primary action of lsd
being serotonergic (5-ht2), whereas that of  xxxd2498xxx  is
dopaminergic.
in addition,  xxxd2498xxx  has been shown (battaglia and
titeler 1981; glusa and markwardt 1984; mcpherson
1984) to interact with a2-adrenoceptors, and its partial
generalization to the a2-adrenoceptor agonist xylazine
(colpaert and janssen 1985) might suggest that  xxxd2498xxx 
acts as a partial a2-adrenoceptor agonist in producing its
discriminative effect. thus, one may draw the conclusion
from this literature that the discriminative stimulus effects
mediated by  xxxd2498xxx  predominantly involve activation of
dopamine receptors and that activation of serotonin 5ht2a/2c receptors, with some influence of a2-adrenoceptors, may play a minor role.
there is, however, substantial evidence that  xxxd2498xxx 
can also produce effects linked to  xxxg1108xxx 
occupancy. this action has generally been ignored in
considering the mechanism of action of  xxxd2498xxx , in favor
of an exclusive role for dopamine receptors in its
antiparkinsonian effects, or for 5-ht2a/2c receptor activation in hallucinogenesis (egan et al. 1998). these
conclusions are actually rather surprising when one
considers that the potent interaction of  xxxd2498xxx  with  xxxg1108xxx  receptors has been demonstrated in several different
laboratories. for example, in 8-hydroxy-2-(n,n-di-npropylamino)tetralin (8-oh-dpat; 0.4 mg/kg)-trained
rats,  xxxd2498xxx  fully substituted for the training drug
(ed50=0.07 mg/kg), whereas lsd, 5-meodmt, ru
24969, and apomorphine engendered predominantly
saline-appropriate responding (cunningham et al.
1987b). nevertheless, the 5-ht1a properties of  xxxd2498xxx 
were never taken into consideration in early comparative
drug discrimination studies with lsd. subsequently,
kimura et al. (1991) reported that the discriminative
stimulus properties of  xxxd2498xxx  are mediated by the dual
activation of 5-ht1a and  xxxg656xxx  sites in the brain. in
antagonism tests, however, they used only  xxxd2621xxx ,
a nonselective 5-ht antagonist that produced only partial
antagonism of the  xxxd2498xxx  cue.
in the 1970s, electrophysiological studies showed that
 xxxd2498xxx , like lsd, produced an abrupt, dose-dependent

95

suppression of serotonergic neuron firing in the dorsal
raphe (rogawski and aghajanian 1979; walters et al.
1979). in fact, in a comparative study,  xxxd2498xxx  was 5–10
times more potent than lsd in selectively inhibiting the
firing of these cells (rogawski and aghajanian 1979);
both intravenous and microiontophoretically applied
 xxxd2498xxx  were more potent in this regard. this effect was
later shown to be dependent upon activation of somatodendritic 5-ht1a autoreceptors (sprouse and aghajanian
1987).
several studies conducted in the last two decades
indicated that  xxxd2498xxx  produced predominantly 5-ht1amediated effects. thus, for the first time, de vivo and
maayani (1986) demonstrated that  xxxd2498xxx  was the most
potent compound they had studied in 5-ht1a receptormediated inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylate
cyclase activity in rat hippocampal membranes. in this
assay,  xxxd2498xxx , lsd, and 5-ht produced a similar
percentage of maximum inhibition of camp generation,
but their ec50 values were significantly different: 5.2, 78,
and 109 nm, respectively. the highest efficacy for
 xxxd2498xxx  was also described in another functional model
of 5-ht1a intrinsic activity (fowler et al. 1992). again,
 xxxd2498xxx  was the most potent for the complete inhibition of
vip (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide) stimulated camp
production in gh4zd10 cells transfected with the 5-ht1a
receptor. moreover, in their saturation experiments [3h] xxxd2498xxx  labeled nearly twice as many sites as did [3h]-8oh-dpat or [3h]-spiperone. also, given that  xxxd2498xxx  is
an agonist, it was surprising in a study by sundaram et al.
(1993) using cho cells transfected with the 5-ht1a
receptor that [3h]- xxxd2498xxx  binding was rather insensitive
to the effects of gtp. these observations indicate that the
binding of [3h]- xxxd2498xxx  to 5-ht1a receptors has characteristics different from those expected for a typical
agonist. it is unlikely that [3h]- xxxd2498xxx  was labeling
other receptors in cho cells, because the results of
competition experiments with antagonists were consistent
with all of the specific binding of [3h]- xxxd2498xxx  being to  xxxg1108xxx  receptors (sundaram et al. 1995). one possibility,
therefore, is that [3h]- xxxd2498xxx  is labeling both the free
receptor and the receptor coupled to g proteins but with
slightly different affinities and that these two states of the
receptor exist in roughly equal amounts in the cells.
 xxxd2498xxx  behaves as a full agonist in modulation of
[35s]gtpgs binding in membranes of cho cells expressing 5-ht1a receptors (mcloughlin and strange 2000)
with an ec50 of 1.1 nm and 95% maximum effect relative
to that produced by 5-ht. in a study investigating the
functional interaction between the  xxxg1108xxx  and
g-proteins using an agonist-stimulated gtp hydrolyzing
assay, odagaki and fuxe (1995) reported that  xxxd2498xxx  was
more than six times more potent (ec50=1.8 nm) than the
selective 5-ht1a agonist 8-oh-dpat (ed50=11 nm) or
lsd (ed50=11 nm).
several behavioral assays have also confirmed the high
efficacy of  xxxd2498xxx  at the  xxxg1108xxx . thus, in the
modified open-field test for assessment of anxiolytic
action of drugs,  xxxd2498xxx , similar to the 5-ht1a agonists 8-

oh-dpat and ipsapirone, shows anxiolytic effects.
dopamine direct and indirect agonists and antagonists
were without any significant effect in this test (rex et al.
1998). millan et al. (1991) reported that  xxxd2498xxx  was more
effective than 8-oh-dpat in induction of the spontaneous tail-flick in the rat, an in vivo model of 5-ht1a
receptor-mediated activity.  xxxd2498xxx , in contrast to lsd,
did not produce enhancement in associative learning, as
measured by accelerated acquisition of the classically
conditioned rabbit nictitating membrane response (welsh
et al. 1998). in that assay  xxxd2498xxx  behaved similarly to the
5-ht1a agonist 8-oh-dpat.  xxxd2498xxx  and 8-oh-dpat
have similar effects on the acoustic startle response
(svensson 1985); both agents markedly increase the
startle amplitude and prolong the startle latency.  xxxd2498xxx ,
however, seemed to be approximately ten times more
potent than 8-oh-dpat, whereas the mainly dopaminereceptor active ergot derivatives pergolide, bromocriptine,
and ly 141865 had no effect, or even reversed the effect,
on the acoustic startle response in the rat.
thus, the preponderance of data seems to suggest that
the most salient feature of  xxxd2498xxx  pharmacology is its
ability to stimulate potently the serotonin  xxxg1108xxx . classification of  xxxd2498xxx  as a selective dopaminergic
agonist is understandable, however, when one considers
that  xxxd2498xxx  is often grouped with structurally similar but
pharmacologically less complex ergot derivatives such as
bromocriptine, where a dopaminergic mechanism seems
to be the only reasonable explanation for its biological
activity. furthermore, activation of 5-ht1a and 5-ht1b
receptors can also modulate dopaminergically mediated
responses, a fact that could confound interpretations of
behavioral data.
the reported lack of full substitution of  xxxd2498xxx  in
lsd-trained rats, and induction of a pronounced 5-ht
syndrome by this compound at relatively low doses
convinced us to execute experiments that might clearly
elucidate the primary mechanism responsible for lisuridemediated biological effects and its paradoxical classification as a dopamine agonist in the literature. it seemed
extremely important to clarify the salient pharmacology
of  xxxd2498xxx  for several reasons, not the least of which was
to provide evidence for the mode of action of  xxxd2498xxx  as a
useful adjunct in the treatment of parkinson’s disease and
parkinsonian disorders. if in fact its therapeutic value did
not reside with its dopaminergic action, but rather in a
serotonergic effect, clinical research in that field would be
prompted to alter its focus from a predominantly dopaminergic perspective.
a first series of experiments was conducted using the
drug discrimination assay. because dopamine was implicated in the discriminative cue of  xxxd2498xxx , substitution
tests were first conducted in rats trained to discriminate
amphetamine from saline. in a second phase of drug
discrimination studies, the possibilities were examined
that  xxxd2498xxx  could mimic serotonin-mediated effects: the
5-ht2a-mediated cue in rats trained to discriminate doi
(2,5-methoxy-4-iodoamphetamine) or lsd from saline,
the 5-ht1a cue induced by ly 293284, or cues induced

96

by 5-ht releasing agents (mmai or (+)-mbdb). in
addition, experiments were carried out comparing  xxxd2498xxx 
with the 5-ht1a agonists 8-oh-dpat and ly 293284 in
the induction of the serotonin syndrome (llr, flat body
posture, and forepaw treading) and hypothermia in rats.
the selective 5-ht1a antagonist p-mppi (4-iodo-n-[2-[4(methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-n-2-pyridynylbenzamide hydrochloride; allen et al. 1994;), the 5-ht2a/
2c antagonist  xxxd2419xxx , and the nonselective dopamine
antagonist haloperidol were used in these studies to block
the behavioral and physiological effects of  xxxd2498xxx .
finally, a series of experiments was conducted to
compare the affinity and efficacy of  xxxd2498xxx  with
reference drugs used in behavioral experiments at
recombinant 5-ht1a, 5-ht2a, and 5-ht2c receptors.
the most interesting finding from this study was the
dominant role of  xxxg1108xxx  activation in lisuridemediated biological effects that differentiates this drug
from hallucinogens (lsd) and from other ergot derivatives such as bromocriptine. involvement of the 5-ht1a
receptor in the interaction with 5-ht2 receptors in
hallucinogenesis and in the interaction between serotonergic and dopaminergic systems will be discussed.

materials and methods
animals
male sprague-dawley rats (harlan laboratories, indianapolis, ind.)
weighing 200–220 g at the beginning of the drug discrimination
study were divided into six groups (n=8–15 per group) and trained
to discriminate lsd tartrate, doi hydrochloride, mmai.hcl, (+)mbdb.hcl, (+)- xxxd163xxx , or ly 293284 from saline.
none of the rats had previously received drugs or behavioral
training. water was freely available in the individual home cages
and a rationed amount of supplemental feed (purina lab blox) was
made available after experimental sessions so as to maintain
approximately 80% of free-feeding weight. lights were on from
0700 hours to 1900 hours. the laboratory and animal facility
temperature was 22–24c and the relative humidity was 40–50%.
experiments were performed between 0900 hours and 1700 hours
each day, monday–friday.
for acute behavioral studies, male sprague-dawley rats
weighing 200€50 g were used. the animals were kept in groups
of five rats per cage, under the same conditions described above,
but with free access to food and water. six rats per group were used
for the agonist-induced behavioral-effects study, and five animals
per group for interaction experiments. all animals used for these
experiments were habituated to the experimental conditions for at
least three consecutive days preceding test sessions (with appropriate handling used during testing procedure). “guide for the care
and use of laboratory animals” (nih, 1996) was followed in the
present experiments and protocols were approved by the purdue
university animal care and use committee.
apparatus
six standard experimental chambers (model e10-10rf, coulbourn
instruments, lehigh valley, pa.) consisted of modular test cages
enclosed within sound-attenuated cubicles with fans for ventilation
and background white noise. a white house light was centered near
the top of the front panel of the cage, which was also equipped with
two response levers, separated by a food hopper (combination

dipper pellet trough, model e14-06, module size 1/2), all positioned
2.5 cm above the floor. solid-state logic in an adjacent room,
interfaced through a med associates (lafayette, ind.) interface to a
486-based microcomputer, controlled reinforcement and data
acquisition with a locally written program.
discrimination training and testing
a fr 50 schedule of food reinforcement (noyes 45-mg dustless
pellets) in a two-lever paradigm was used. the drug discrimination
procedure details have been described elsewhere (marona-lewicka
and nichols 1994). after habituation to the experimental conditions
(1 week after placement into individual home cages and at the
beginning of the food deprivation) initial shaping was begun.
during the first two to three sessions, rats were trained only to
associate a characteristic noise (click) after lever pressing with a
delivered food pellet (without drug injections). initially, rats were
shaped to lever press on a fr 1 schedule so that one food pellet was
dispensed for each press. half of the rats were trained on drug-left,
saline-right and the other half on drug-right, saline-left to avoid
positional preference. training sessions lasted 15 min and were
conducted at the same time each day. levers were cleaned between
animals with 10%  xxxd102xxx  to avoid olfactory cues (extance
and goudie 1981). only one appropriate lever was present during
the first ten sessions of initial learning (after beginning to
administer saline or training drug, i.p. 30 min before sessions).
afterward, both levers were present during all following phases of
training, but reinforcements were delivered only after responses on
the appropriate lever. presses on the incorrect lever had no
programmed consequences. as responding rates stabilized (during
the next 15 sessions), the schedule of reinforcement was gradually
increased to a fr 50. once at the fr 50, training continued until an
accuracy of at least 85% (number of correct presses 100/number
of total presses) was attained for eight of ten consecutive sessions
(approximately 40–60 sessions). once criterion performance was
attained, test sessions were interspersed between training sessions,
either one or two times per week. at least one drug and one saline
session separated each test session. rats were required to maintain
the 85% correct responding criterion on training days in order to be
tested. in addition, test data were discarded when the accuracy
criterion of 85% was not achieved on the two training sessions
following a test session. test drugs were administered i.p. 30 min
prior to the sessions; test sessions were run under conditions of
extinction, with rats removed from the operant chamber when 50
presses were emitted on one lever. if 50 presses on one lever were
not completed within 5 min, the session was ended and scored as a
disruption. treatments were randomized at the beginning of the
study.
temperature measurements and behavioral observations
all behavioral experiments took place in a quiet room, at a
temperature of 22–24c between 0900 hours and 1600 hours.
animals were observed in a plastic cage with dimensions
242420 cm. the animals were habituated by placing them
individually in the cage for 30 min before the experiment.
for more complete observation of lower-lip retraction (llr), a
mirror was placed below the mesh floor of each cage. the animals
were scored at 15, 30, and 60 min after injection for a period of
1 min as follows: 0 = lower incisors are not visible (not different
from untreated rats), 1 = lower incisors partly visible, 2 = major
part of incisors clearly visible, 3 = lower incisors are completely
visible. an observer who was blind to the treatment scored the
animal behavioral syndromes.
stereotyped behavior was rated using scales described by
nabeshima et al. (1984) with some modification. briefly, 5-ht
syndromes other than llr were scored during the 1-min period at
5, 15, 30, and 60 min after drug administration. they were rated as
follows: flat body posture, forepaw treading, and shaking behavior
(head shaking plus a “wet dog” shaking syndrome) using the

97
intensity scale of these syndromes: 0 – absent, 1 – occasionally
perceptible, 2 – weak, 3 – medium, 4 – constant.
body temperature was measured with a cma/150 temperature
controller (carnegie medicin, stockholm, sweden) by lubricating
the probe tip with  xxxd2648xxx  and inserting it approximately 3 cm
into the rectum for 10–15 s. measurements were taken 10 min and
just before compound administration and at 15, 30, and 60 min after
s.c. treatment. the changes in body temperature were evaluated by
determining the temperature differences after treatment compared
with the pretreatment values.
in the interaction tests, the antagonist ( xxxd2419xxx , haloperidol,
or p-mppi) was given s.c. 10 min before  xxxd2498xxx  (0.1 mg/kg s.c.) or
lsd (0.8 mg/kg s.c.). doses of antagonists were chosen based on
preliminary studies. behavioral syndromes and core temperature
were measured only at 30 min after agonist injection and scored
according to the rating scale presented above.
radioligand competition assays in cloned receptors
cell culture
nih3t3 fibroblast cells stably transfected with either the rat 5ht2a or  xxxg1115xxx  were a gift from dr. david julius. cho
cells stably transfected with the human  xxxg1108xxx  were a gift
from upjohn. cells were maintained in minimum essential medium
containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (gibco brl, carlsbad,
calif.) and supplemented with l-glutamine, pen/strep, and either
 xxxd2191xxx  (nih3t3 cells) or hygromycin b (cho cells). the cells
were cultured at 37c in a water-saturated atmosphere of 95% air
and 5% co2. for radioligand binding assays, cells were split into
100-mm2 culture dishes when they reached 90% confluency. upon
reaching 100% confluence in the culture dishes, the cells were
washed with sterile filtered phosphate-buffered solution and left to
incubate in serum free opti-mem (gibco-brl) for 5 h. after this
incubation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (15,000g,
20 min) and placed immediately in a –80c freezer until the assays
were performed. for phosphoinositide hydrolysis or camp efficacy
studies, cells were seeded into 48-well tissue culture plates, and the
assays were performed when a confluent monolayer was formed.
radioligand binding assays. for saturation binding assays, 0.25–
12 nm [3h]8-oh-dpat or 0.125–5.0 nm [125i]-doi was used. the
total volume of the assay was 250 l. nonspecific binding was
defined as the binding measured in the presence of 10 m
cinanserin (5-ht2a cells), 10 m  xxxd2637xxx  (5-ht2c cells), or
10 m serotonin (5-ht1a expressing cells). competition binding
experiments were carried out in a total volume of 500 l with
either 0.80 nm [3h]8-oh-dpat or 0.20 nm [125i]-doi. previously
harvested cells were resuspended and added to each well containing
assay buffer [50 mm tris, 0.5 mm ethylene diamine tetraacetic
acid (edta), 10 mm mgcl2, ph 7.4], radioligand, and test
compound (or in the case of the saturation isotherm assays,
cinanserin,  xxxd2637xxx , or serotonin). the incubation was carried out
at 25c for 60 min and then terminated by rapid filtration using a
pre-chilled packard 96-well harvester with gf/b uni-filters
(packard instrument corp., downer’s grove, ill.) that had been
incubating for 30 min in 0.3% polyethylenimine. the filters were
rinsed using chilled wash buffer (10 mm tris, 154 mm nacl) and
left to dry overnight. the following day, microscint-o (packard
instrument corp.) was added and radioactivity was determined
using a topcount (packard) scintillation counter.
phosphoinositide hydrolysis studies
accumulation of inositol phosphates was determined using a
modified version of a previously published protocol (berg et al.
1994). briefly, cells expressing the rat  xxxg1113xxx  were
labeled for 18–20 h in crml medium containing 1.0 ci/ml
[3h]myo-inositol. after pretreating the cells with 10 m  xxxd2850xxx /
10 mm licl for 15 min, agonist was added to the cells for 30 min at

37c, under 95% o2/5% co2. the assay was terminated by
aspirating the medium and adding 10 mm  xxxd2154xxx . after
incubation for 16 h at 4c, the [3h]inositol phosphates were
separated from the cellular debris on dowex-1 ion-exchange
columns and eluted with 1.0 m ammonium formate and 0.10 m
 xxxd2154xxx . the vials were counted for tritium using a tricarb
scintillation counter (packard instrument corp.).
inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp production
camp accumulation assay
cho-h5ht1a cells were grown to 100% confluence in 48-well
cluster plates. cells were incubated for 10 min in 200 l assay
buffer (ebss containing 0.02%  xxxd228xxx  and 2% fetal calf
serum). following incubation, cells were placed on ice, increasing
concentrations of 5-ht1a agonist ( xxxd2498xxx , 8-oh-dpat, or ly
293284) were added to the wells, and then 50 m  xxxd1742xxx  was
added. incubations were carried out for 15 min at 37c. the media
was removed by aspiration and the cells were lysed with ice-cold
3% trichloroacetic acid. cell lysates were stored at 4c for at least
1h.
quantification of camp
cyclic  xxxd81xxx  (camp) was quantified using a
competitive binding assay adapted from that of nordstedt and
fredholm (1990) with minor modifications. duplicate samples of
the cell lysate (15 l) were added to reaction tubes containing
camp assay buffer (100 mm tris/hcl, ph 7.4, 100 mm nacl,
5 mm edta). [3h]camp (2 nm final concentration) was added to
each well. binding protein (ca. 150 g in 200 l camp buffer) was
then added to each well. the reaction tubes were incubated on ice
for 2 h. the tubes were then harvested by filtration (packard
unifilter gf/b) using a 96-well packard filtermate harvester. the
filters were allowed to dry and packard microscint scintillation
fluid was added to each sample. radioactivity on the filters was
counted on a packard topcount scintillation/luminescence detector. camp concentrations from each sample were estimated in
duplicate from a standard curve ranging from 0.1 pmol to 300 pmol
camp per tube.

 xxxd2637xxx  was purchased from sigma chemical corp. (st. louis,
mo.), and serotonin creatinine sulfate,  xxxd1742xxx , and cinanserin
were purchased from rbi.
data analysis
data from the drug discrimination study were scored in a quantal
fashion, with the lever on which the rat first emitted 50 presses in a
test session scored as the “selected” lever. the percentage of rats
selecting the drug lever (%sdl) for each dose of test compound
was determined. the degree of substitution was determined by the
maximum %sdl for all doses of the test drug. “no substitution” is
defined as 59% sdl or less, and “partial” substitution is 60–79%
sdl. if the drug was one that completely substituted for the
training drug (at least one dose resulted in a %sdl=80% or higher)
the method of litchfield and wilcoxon (1949) was used to
determine the ed50 and 95% confidence interval (95% c.i.). if the
percentage of rats disrupted (%d) was 50% or higher, the ed50
value was not determined, even if the %sdl of nondisrupted
animals was higher than 80%.
the changes in body temperature were evaluated by determining the temperature differences after treatment (t15, t30, or t60–t0)
compared with the pretreatment value (t0–t–10). the final results
are expressed as the mean€sem of these differences per group
(n=6). the statistical significance of the drug effect was determined

by comparing the results of each group with the results of the
relevant control group using one-way analysis of variance followed
by tukey’s post-hoc multiple comparison test using graphpad
instat (graphpad software, san diego, calif.).
the llr, flat body posture, and forepaw treading were scored
separately three times (15, 30, and 60 min after treatment) and
added together for each rat so that a total maximum score of 9 per
syndrome, per animal could be recorded. the final results are
expressed as the mean score €sem per group for each syndrome.
data from behavioral observations were also analyzed for each
measurement after treatment and separately expressed as the mean
€sem per group, per syndrome (maximum score =3, n=6). the
statistical significance of the drug-induced behavioral syndromes
was determined by comparing the results of each group with those
of the relevant saline control using one-way analysis of variance
followed by tukey’s post-hoc multiple comparison test (graphpad
instat).
graphpad prism (graphpad software) was used to analyze the
saturation and competition binding curves for radioligand binding
experiments. calculation of camp accumulation for unknown
samples from a standard curve was performed using nonlinear
regression also using the program graphpad prism.

posture (b), or forepaw treading (c). values shown are the
mean€sem of the sum of the three scores (at 15, 30, and 60 min
after drug injection, maximal possible score =9) of six rats per
group. at each time point, the behavior was scored according to the
rating scale described in detail in methods. all doses of all drug
tested produced a significant drug effect relative to saline (p<0.01)

table 1 shows the effects of  xxxd2498xxx  in substitution tests
in several groups of rats trained to discriminate lsd,
doi, ly 293284, (+)-amphetamine, mmai, or (+)mbdb from saline.  xxxd2498xxx  fully substituted only for
the 5-ht1a agonist ly 293284, with an ed50 of
39.6 nmol/kg. moreover, in ly 293284-trained rats,
 xxxd2498xxx  did not produce significant disruption of behavior; even at the highest dose tested (0.1 mg/kg) most of
the animals were able to emit 50 or more presses during
the 5 min extinction test. interestingly, lsd (0.02–
0.16 mg/kg) tested in ly 293284-trained animals produced mostly saline appropriate responding (data not
shown). only partial substitution of  xxxd2498xxx  was observed
in animals trained to recognize a 5-ht2a/2c receptormediated cue, i.e., in lsd- and doi-trained rats.
administration of different doses of  xxxd2498xxx  engendered
a bell-shaped curve of dose-related, drug-appropriate
lever selection in lsd, amphetamine, and mmai-trained
rats. generally, behavioral syndromes observed at the
higher doses of  xxxd2498xxx  (0.1 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg)
significantly influenced the number of responses emitted
by rats, resulting in behavioral disruption in more than
half of the animals tested.

effects of  xxxd2498xxx  and selected serotonergic agonists
on  xxxg1108xxx -mediated behaviors in the rat
 xxxd2498xxx  induced significant and dose-related increases in
llr, flat body posture, and forepaw treading responses
(fig. 1). lsd at doses of 0.2–0.8 mg/kg produced no
significant llr or forepaw treading during a 1-h
observation period (data not shown); however, a slight
flat body posture effect was induced by 0.8 mg/kg lsd.
this effect could be scored at 30 min and 60 min after
drug injection, but did not reach statistical significance.
after s.c. administration,  xxxd2498xxx  was approximately
equipotent to ly 293284 and about five times more
potent than the 5-ht1a agonist 8-oh-dpat. within a
few minutes after s.c. injection of  xxxd2498xxx , the lower lip of
the rat was retracted so that the lower incisors were
completely visible. this effect of  xxxd2498xxx  reached a
maximum at 15 min after treatment, similar to llr
induced by ly 293284 or 8-oh-dpat (table 2). the

llr produced by  xxxd2498xxx  was dose dependent, with
intensity and duration comparable to that produced by ly
293284 and a potency about five times that of 8-ohdpat. as shown in table 2, only slight llr persisted
60 min after drug administration, produced only at the
highest doses of all drugs tested.
effects on body temperature in male rats
ly 293284,  xxxd2498xxx , and 8-oh-dpat induced a dosedependent decrease in body temperature in rats, which
reached statistical significance 15 min after injections
(fig. 2). by contrast, lsd at the 0.8-mg/kg dose produced
a slight elevation of body temperature; however, this
effect did not reach statistical significance at the 15-min
post-injection time (fig. 2). table 3 shows the effect of

drug administration: 15, 30, and 60 min. the maximum
effect for  xxxd2498xxx , ly 293284, and 8-oh-dpat occurred
30 min postinjection. lsd, however, induced an elevation
in body temperature that reached statistical significance
only at the dose of 0.8 mg/kg, 60 min after injection
(table 3). the observed increase in body temperature
may not be the maximum increase induced by 0.8 mg/kg
lsd because core temperature was not measured at any
later time point.  xxxd2498xxx  shows a potency similar to ly
293284 in reduction of body temperature, and again was
approximately five times more potent than 8-oh-dpat.

haloperidol, a nonselective dopamine receptor antagonist,
 xxxd2419xxx , a 5-ht2a/2c receptor antagonist, and pmppi, a
selective  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist, were tested for their
potential to induce changes in behavior and body
temperature by themselves and to evaluate their effect
on the  xxxd2498xxx - or lsd-induced behavioral syndrome and
thermoregulation. none of the antagonists produced the
5-ht syndrome nor did they affect body temperature in
rats (data not shown). haloperidol at the dose of 0.1 mg/

idol significantly inhibited  xxxd2498xxx -induced forepaw
treading relative to  xxxd2498xxx  alone. this inhibition appears
to result from an interference of the cataleptic-sedative
effects produced by haloperidol with actions mediated by
 xxxd2498xxx .
the 5-ht1a antagonist pmppi was effective in
inhibiting all of the behaviors produced by  xxxd2498xxx 
(table 4) but it did not alter the behavioral effects
induced by lsd. rats treated with pmppi and  xxxd2498xxx 
also presented several yawning and stretching episodes,
combined with penile erections. by contrast, pretreatment
with  xxxd2419xxx  was not effective against  xxxd2498xxx -induced
behaviors but did accentuate lsd-induced flat body
posture (table 4).
figure 3 shows the effects of the antagonists on
hypothermia induced by  xxxd2498xxx  and hyperthermia produced by lsd, 30 min after agonist administration.
haloperidol and  xxxd2419xxx  were without significant effect
on hypothermia induced by  xxxd2498xxx . both of these
antagonists appeared to block the temperature elevation
produced by lsd but because the lsd effect did not
reach significance at 30 min after injection, the effect of
these pretreatments was also not significant. by contrast,
pretreatment with pmppi (2.0 mg/kg) prevented the
hypothermia produced by  xxxd2498xxx  (0.1 mg/kg) but had no
effect on the elevation of body temperature induced by
lsd.
binding affinities and functional activity of  xxxd2498xxx 
and reference drugs at recombinant 5-ht1a, 5-ht2a,
and 5-ht2c receptors
radioligand binding affinities for  xxxd2498xxx  and the reference drugs at the recombinant human  xxxg1108xxx 
stably expressed in cho cells are presented in table 5.
as a functional endpoint, the ability of  xxxd2498xxx , ly
293284, and 8-oh-dpat to inhibit  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated
camp accumulation mediated by the  xxxg1108xxx 
was measured.  xxxd2498xxx  possesses affinity comparable to
8-oh-dpat at the recombinant human  xxxg1108xxx ;
however, it is approximately ten times more potent in
inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp production. all
compounds tested in this assay behaved as full agonists
with intrinsic activity comparable to serotonin, with
percentages of camp inhibition of: 93€3.1%, 83€4.7%,
86€2.7%, and 83€3.3%, respectively, for 5-ht, 8-ohdpat, ly 293284, and  xxxd2498xxx .
competition studies were performed with 5-ht,
 xxxd2498xxx , and lsd versus [125i]-doi binding at membranes of nih3t3 fibroblast cells stably transfected with
either the rat 5-ht2a or  xxxg1115xxx . ki values at the
 xxxg1113xxx  for 5-ht,  xxxd2498xxx , and lsd were
21€2.8 nm, 7.2€0.33 nm, and 2.7€0.42 nm, respectively,
and at the  xxxg1115xxx  were 1.5€0.31 nm,
9.8€1.6 nm, and 5.5€0.31 nm, respectively. determination of affinity at 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c receptors was
repeated at least three times for all agonists. for
functional assays, the ability of 5-ht,  xxxd2498xxx , and lsd

to stimulate plc by measuring total inositol phosphate
(ip) accumulation mediated by 5-ht2a or 5-ht2c receptors was employed. initially, a time course experiment
was conducted to determine the optimal 5-ht incubation
time to produce a robust stimulation of plc; 30-min
incubation was found to be best (results not shown). data
from these experiments are presented in table 6. to
ensure that 5-ht-stimulated ip accumulation was 5-ht2a
or  xxxg1115xxx  mediated,  xxxd2419xxx , a nonselective
 xxxg1113xxx  antagonist was employed. pretreatment of
nih 3t3–5-ht2a or nih 3t3–5-ht2c cells with  xxxd2419xxx  (100 m) prior to stimulation with 5-ht (10 m)
resulted in complete inhibition of ip accumulation (data
not shown).

discussion
the current studies provide substantial evidence that
activation of 5-ht1a receptors plays the major role in
 xxxd2498xxx -mediated behavior, as well as thermoregulation in
rats. in drug discrimination studies,  xxxd2498xxx  fully mimicked the 5-ht1a agonist ly 293284 and only partially
substituted for lsd or doi. the preponderance of
evidence suggests that the discriminative stimulus effects
of lsd (glennon et al. 1984; cunningham and appel
1987; titeler et al. 1988; arnt 1989) and doi (glennon
1986; chojnacka-wojcik and klodzinska 1997; smith et
al. 1999) are mediated by postsynaptic 5-ht2a receptors.
the drug discrimination procedure has several advantages over other behavioral procedures used to study drug
action, including exquisite sensitivity to low doses of
drugs (doses that do not produce visible changes in
behavior), and specificity for particular neuronal actions
in the cns. thus, in rats trained to discriminate ly
293284 from saline, only drugs possessing high efficacy
at 5-ht1a receptors will produce complete substitution.
 xxxd2498xxx  not only mimics ly 293284 in this assay but also
has potency comparable to the training drug: ed50 values
are 40 nmol/kg and 21 nmol/kg for  xxxd2498xxx  and ly
293284, respectively. previously, cunningham et al.
(1987b) reported that  xxxd2498xxx  fully mimicked 8-ohdpat, whereas lsd produced only 35% drug lever
selection in rats trained to discriminate 8-oh-dpat from
saline. these results show that the 5-ht1a agonist
property of  xxxd2498xxx  is significantly more robust in the
drug discrimination assay than that of lsd.
despite dopaminergic effects of  xxxd2498xxx  in vitro, it is
possible that activation of 5-ht1a receptors by  xxxd2498xxx  in
vivo might override or functionally antagonize its effects
at other receptors. although interactions between 5-ht1a
and 5-ht2a receptors appear to be complex and not fully
elucidated, evidence is accumulating to indicate that  xxxg1108xxx  receptor agonists may have effects similar to 5ht2a receptor antagonists in a variety of systems. for
example, pretreatment with the 5-ht1a agonist 8-ohdpat inhibited the mouse head twitch response to the 5ht2a/2c agonist doi (darmani et al. 1990). similarly,
whereas 5-ht2a antagonism is believed to be one of the

most important properties of new-generation antipsychotic drugs (meltzer and maes 1995), ahlenius (1988) first
suggested that stimulation of 5-ht1a receptors might
produce an antipsychotic-like effect, based on behavioral
studies in animals using 8-oh-dpat. furthermore, 5ht2 antagonists appear able to enhance the behavior
induced by 8-oh-dpat (mcmillen et al. 1987; backus et
al. 1990).
it has been postulated that the dopaminergic system
plays a major role in the discriminative stimulus effects of
 xxxd2498xxx , presumably through activation of dopamine d2like receptors (cunningham et al. 1987a; callahan and
appel 1990; kimura et al. 1991). we tested this
hypothesis in rats trained to discriminate (+)-amphetamine from saline. amphetamine is principally a releaser
and reuptake blocker of neuronal catecholamines. its
discriminative stimulus effect is mediated primarily by
dopaminergic d2-like receptors, with some influence of
dopamine d1-like receptors (brauer et al. 1997).  xxxd2498xxx 
produced only 50% substitution in these animals at
0.05 mg/kg, which according to our criteria would be
classified as “no substitution.”  xxxd2498xxx  produced the
same degree of substitution in rats trained to discriminate
the 5-ht releasing agents, mmai and (+)-mbdb.
activation of 5-ht1a and/or 5-ht1b receptors probably
plays a central role in mediating the stimulus properties of
5-ht releasers because the mixed 5-ht1a/1b agonist ru
24969 (o’neill and parameswarn 1997) fully mimicked
the (+)-mbdb (nichols and oberlender 1990) and
mmai (unpublished result) cues. moreover, in studies
by cunningham et al. (1987a), the  xxxd2498xxx -mediated
discriminative cue was blocked not only by the d2
antagonists bromolisuride and (–)-sulpiride, but also by
the nonselective 5-ht antagonist pirenperone, suggesting
some influence of the  xxxg1113xxx  in the discriminative effect produced by  xxxd2498xxx . it is now known,
however, that bromolisuride is actually a more potent  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist than d2 antagonist (assie et al. 1997), a
fact consistent with the conclusion that the 5-ht1a
agonist property of  xxxd2498xxx  is important for its discriminative stimulus effects.
in all our substitution tests, doses of  xxxd2498xxx  higher
than 0.05 mg/kg significantly affected the response rate
by producing a high percentage of disruption. in the
studies by cunningham et al. (1987a), use of  xxxd2498xxx  as

the training drug reduced response rates by 50% relative
to responding after saline, and this rate suppression was
not reversed in combination tests using d2 or 5-ht2
antagonists. those authors therefore suggested that the
mechanisms underlying the stimulus and rate effects of
 xxxd2498xxx  might differ, although selective 5-ht1a antagonists were never tested against  xxxd2498xxx  in their drug
discrimination assays. thus, it is likely that the 5-ht
syndrome produced by  xxxd2498xxx  causes behaviors that
interfere with responding in the drug discrimination
assay.
the data presented from our drug discrimination
studies parallel affinity and efficacy of  xxxd2498xxx  at the  xxxg1108xxx  and 5-ht2a receptors. thus,  xxxd2498xxx  possesses high
affinity (ki=0.19 nm) and full agonist activity at the  xxxg1108xxx  receptor but is approximately four times less potent
than lsd in stimulating 5-ht2a-mediated phosphatidyl
inositol (pi) hydrolysis and produced only 13% of the
maximal stimulation obtained with 5-ht in this latter
assay.
 xxxd2498xxx  produced a significant and dose-related
increase in flat body posture, forepaw treading, and
llr that reflects a modulation of behavior via an action
at 5-ht1a receptors in the cns (tricklebank 1985; smith
and peroutka 1986; moore et al. 1993). the 5-ht
syndrome produced by  xxxd2498xxx  was qualitatively similar
to that induced by the commonly used ligand of choice 8oh-dpat and produced by the potent 5-ht1a agonist
ly 293284 (foreman et al. 1994). we believe this is the
first report that  xxxd2498xxx , a drug possessing multiple sites
of action, produces llr in rats. llr is seen only after
injection of selective 5-ht1a agonists (berendsen et al.
1989; moore et al. 1993). recently, somatodendritic  xxxg1108xxx  autoreceptors in the median raphe nucleus have
been suggested as the site responsible for the mediation of
llr (berendsen et al. 1994; bagdy and to 1997). the
mixed 5-ht1a/2a/2c receptor agonist 5-methoxy-n,ndimethyltryptamine (5-meodmt) only induced llr if
the rats were pretreated with a 5-ht2a/2c receptor
antagonist like  xxxd1785xxx  or ritanserin. coactivation
of 5-ht2c and/or 5-ht2a receptors by concomitant
injection of m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mcpp) or doi
attenuated 8-oh-dpat-induced llr (berendsen et al.
1989). these observations suggest that activation of 5ht2a/2c receptors inhibits development of llr, and in

104

drugs possessing dominant 5-ht2a/2c agonist properties,
like lsd, llr will not be observed unless 5-ht2a/2c
receptors are blocked. this speculation is consistent with
the fact that  xxxd2498xxx  has about twice the functional
potency of lsd at the  xxxg1108xxx  (table 5) but only
about one-fourth the potency of lsd in stimulating 5ht2a-mediated pi hydrolysis (table 6). it is harder to
explain, however, why lsd did not produce llr, even
after blockade of 5-ht2a/2c receptors by  xxxd2419xxx .
pretreatment with  xxxd2419xxx  did, however, accentuate
lsd-induced flat body posture, suggesting that 5-ht2a/2c
activation is masking some 5-ht1-like receptor-mediated
lsd behaviors.
thus, relative potency in stimulating 5-ht2a receptormediated pi turnover seems to be important in the
interaction between 5-ht2a and 5-ht1a receptors in
expression of behavior mediated by these specific 5-ht
receptors, although recently rabin et al. (2002) concluded
that pi hydrolysis does not appear to be the critical
mechanism involved in the discriminative stimulus effects
of lsd. the present results indicate that  xxxd2498xxx  and lsd
have similar potency in stimulating pi turnover mediated
by the  xxxg1115xxx  and both compounds are full
agonists in our assay (table 6). these data contrast with
previously published results from intact choroid plexus or
from cultured cells, where  xxxd2498xxx  potently blocked 5ht-stimulated pi hydrolysis without increasing pi turnover itself (burris et al. 1991). both the expression of
various edited isoforms of the  xxxg1115xxx  that
exhibit differential abilities to bind ligands, as well as the
differential signaling from different ligands due to
“agonist-direct trafficking” that is cell specific might be
responsible for these divergent pi turnover results.
in the present study, only pmppi, a selective 5-ht1a
antagonist (allen et al. 1994), was effective in inhibiting
all of the behavioral components of the 5-ht syndrome
produced by  xxxd2498xxx , whereas  xxxg1108xxx  blockade
was without effect on lsd-induced behaviors. after
blockade of 5-ht1a receptors, we did observe yawning
and penile erection in  xxxd2498xxx -treated animals, but these
behaviors were not scored. these effects are believed to
result from stimulation of dopamine autoreceptors, with a
consequent decrease in dopaminergic transmission (portais et al. 1983).
haloperidol, a nonselective dopamine receptor antagonist slightly but nonsignificantly attenuated llr and flat
body posture produced by  xxxd2498xxx , but significantly
reduced forepaw treading induced by  xxxd2498xxx . by contrast, pretreatment with haloperidol led to flat body
posture after lsd administration, although this response
did not reach statistical significance.
several studies have indicated that dopamine-dependent systems are needed for some components of the 5ht syndrome but inhibit others. for example, the
nonselective dopaminergic agonist apomorphine inhibited
the hindlimb abduction and straub tail response elicited
by 5-meodmt but enhanced forepaw treading (dickinson and curzon 1983). apomorphine also has been shown
to inhibit 5-htp (5-hydroxytryptophan) induced wet dog

shakes (bedard and pycock 1977), whereas potentiation
of this behavior was observed after pretreatment with the
 xxxg1108xxx  antagonist (s)-uh-301 (bjork et al.
1991). moreover, the putative 5-ht1a agonist ly 165163
failed to induce any component of the 5-ht syndrome,
even at high doses (hutson et al. 1987), possibly due to its
potent dopamine d2-like antagonist properties (donohoe
et al. 1987). however, u-67413b, a compound with
agonist properties at both the d2 (ki=3.6 nm) and 5-ht1a
(ki=10 nm) receptors elicited only the 5-ht syndrome,
without producing stereotypies characteristic of dopaminergic agonists (piercey et al. 1994). these observations
suggest that activation of d2 dopamine receptors may
allow or even promote expression of the 5-ht1a receptormediated 5-ht syndrome, whereas  xxxg656xxx  blockade
can totally inhibit 5-ht1a-mediated behaviors. an agonist
effect at 5-ht1a receptors thus appears to inhibit expression of  xxxg656xxx -mediated stereotypic behavior.
the  xxxg1113xxx  is thought to mediate hyperthermic
responses, whereas 5-ht1a activation results in hypothermia (gudelsky et al. 1986). it also has been shown
that dopamine receptor agonists, like apomorphine,
decrease body temperature in rats (cox and lee 1979).
in our study  xxxd2498xxx  dose dependently decreased body
temperature in rats with a potency similar to that of the
selective 5-ht1a agonist ly 293284. the hypothermic
effect of  xxxd2498xxx  was consistently blocked by preadministration of the selective 5-ht1a antagonist pmppi, but
was only slightly attenuated, and not in all animals, by the
5-ht2a/2c antagonist  xxxd2419xxx  or by the dopamine d2
antagonist, haloperidol. thus, activation of 5-ht1a
receptors plays the major role in hypothermia produced
by  xxxd2498xxx . it is hard to explain why pretreatment with
haloperidol had little effect on  xxxd2498xxx -induced hypothermia in our study; whereas, in a previous report (carruba et
al. 1980),  xxxd2956xxx  effectively attenuated  xxxd2498xxx -induced hypothermia in rats and hyperthermia in rabbits. in
the same study, however (carruba et al. 1980), the  xxxg1108xxx /2a/2c receptor antagonist metergoline significantly
attenuated the  xxxd2498xxx  effect whereas pretreatment with
 xxxd2419xxx  was without significant effect. thus, based on
previous studies and our experiments here, it seems
possible that both 5-ht1a serotonin and d2 dopamine
receptors are involved in thermoregulation changes
induced by  xxxd2498xxx . this conclusion requires future
evaluation, for example, by using combined pretreatment
with selective 5-ht1a and d2 antagonists.
in summary, we have demonstrated that the behavioral
effects of low doses (<0.1 mg/kg) of  xxxd2498xxx  are clearly
mediated by stimulation of 5-ht1a receptors. although
 xxxd2498xxx  possesses low nanomolar affinity for dopamine
and serotonin receptors, the discriminative stimulus
effects and the behavior produced by  xxxd2498xxx  are dominated by its agonist profile at the serotonin 5-ht1a
receptor.
although  xxxd2498xxx  has high affinity for d2 dopamine
receptors, it produces unusual effects relative to other
dopamine agonists (watts and neve 1996). treatment
with  xxxd2498xxx  decreased the density of d2 receptors with

105

no change in the kd value, whereas most d2 agonists do
not alter receptor number after short exposure, but
increase the density after longer exposure.  xxxd2498xxx 
appears to dissociate very slowly from d2 receptors,
producing apparent downregulation of d2 receptors and
heterologous desensitization of adenylate cyclase that is
caused by persistently bound agonist (watts and neve
1996). thus, it seems possible that prolonged, nondissociable binding of  xxxd2498xxx  to dopamine receptors might
have functional implications that attenuate behavior
normally mediated by this receptor.
taken together, our results suggest the hypothesis that
activation of the 5-ht1a serotonin receptor by  xxxd2498xxx 
may functionally antagonize effects mediated by  xxxd2498xxx 
stimulation of both 5-ht2a and dopamine d2-like receptors. by contrast, the demonstrated clinical value of
 xxxd2498xxx  as an adjunct to levodopa in parkinson’s disease,
and its predominant 5-ht1a pharmacological actions,
suggests that an examination of other 5-ht1a agonists in
the treatment of this disease may be warranted. in
particular, the recognition (huang et al. 2001) that the
stimulation of dopamine d1 receptors may be more
important in the actions of levodopa suggests that 5-ht1a
receptor agonism might be synergistic with dopamine d1
receptor activation.
