abstract-we
have examined the effects on the activities of three calmodulin-dependent
enzymes
(camp phosphodiesterase,
caldesmon kinase and myosin light chain kinase) of the dihydropyridine
ca*+ channel blocker  xxxd2092xxx  and three analogues (p-chloro, oxidized and r-butyl) exhibiting different
pharmacological potencies. the camp phosphodiesterase was inhibited completely by  xxxd2092xxx  and
thep-chloro analogue with q,, values of 3.7 and 1.5 pm respectively. the oxidized and t-butyl analogues
were relatively ineffective in inhibiting camp phosphodiesterase.  xxxd2092xxx  and the p-chloro analogue
inhibited the basal (ca2+/calmodulin-independent)
activity of camp phosphodiesterase as well as the
calmodulin-stimulated activity. calmodulin was relatively ineffective in preventing inhibition of camp
phosphodiesterase by  xxxd2092xxx  and the p-chloro analogue. these observations suggest that  xxxd2092xxx 
may act directly on the phosphodiesterase
as well as through calmodulin.  xxxd2092xxx  and the pchloro analogue inhibited car+/calmodulin-dependent
caldesmon kinase with similar potencies (1~50=
17.4 pm), whereas the oxidized and r-butyl analogues caused no inhibition. similarly,  xxxd2092xxx  and
the p-chloro analogue inhibited myosin light chain kinase activity whether the isolated 20 kd light chain
(qo = 12.6pm) or intact myosin (icy = 11.0 pm) was used as substrate. inhibition in each case was

prevented by excess calmodulin. the oxidized and r-butyl derivatives caused little or no inhibition.
finally, the effects of  xxxd2092xxx  and the three analogues on two processes which are dependent on
myosin phosphorylation were examined, namely the actin-activated mg’+-atpase activity of myosin
and the assembly of myosin filaments.  xxxd2092xxx  and thep-chloro analogue inhibited the actin-activated
mg*+-atpase activity of smooth muscle myosin (icy = 25.1 ym). the oxidized and t-butyl analogues
exhibited no inhibition. similarly,  xxxd2092xxx  and the p-chloro analogue blocked myosin filament
assembly induced by low concentrations of calmodulin, whereas the oxidized and t-butyl analogues did
not. again, inhibition of the actin-activated myosin mg *+-atpase and myosin filament assembly by
 xxxd2092xxx  and the p-chloro analogue could be reversed by raising the calmodulin concentration. these
observations suggest that some of the pharmacological actions of  xxxd2092xxx  on smooth muscle may
involve inhibition of calmodulin-dependent
enzymes which are functionally involved in the regulation
of smooth muscle contraction.

 xxxd2092xxx 
[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-l&dihydropyridine-2,6-dimethyl
3,5dicarboxylic
3-ethyl ester
and 5methyl ester] is a potent vasodilating agent
of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist group of
compounds [l] with selectivity for arterial resistance
vessels [2]. the inhibition of vascular smooth muscle
contraction by dihydropyridine ca2+ channel blockers (e.g. nifedipine) is thought to be due primarily
to its action on voltage-operated calcium channels,
blocking ca2+ entry into the cell [3]. however,
additional (intracellular) sites of action of  xxxd2092xxx 
and related dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers have been suggested [l]. in support of such a
notion,  xxxd2092xxx  interacts in uitro with calmodulin
in a ca2+-dependent manner [4-6], and recent photoaffinity labeling studies have demonstrated
the
specific binding of [3h] xxxd2092xxx  to a soluble protein
of porcine mesenteric arterial smooth muscle of subunit m, 62 kd [7].
earlier studies have demonstrated an inhibition
of two calmodulin-dependent
enzymes, camp
phosphodiesterase
[ 1, s-101 and myosin light chain
kinase [ 1, 11, 121, by  xxxd2092xxx . inhibition of these

enzymes was observed with ki values in the l-10 pm
range, compared with half-maximal inhibition of
contraction of vascular smooth muscle strips at  xxxd2092xxx  concentrations in the nanomolar range [4,
121. this apparent discrepancy does not necessarily
mean that the mechanism of action of  xxxd2092xxx 
does not involve its interaction with calmodulin,
since ca2’ antagonists like  xxxd2092xxx  can accumulate
in smooth muscle cells [ 1,131. we have pursued this
problem by investigating the effects of  xxxd2092xxx  and
three analogues exhibiting different pharmacological
potencies on the activities of three calmodulindependent enzymes which are involved in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction:
camp
phosphodiesterase,
caldesmon kinase and myosin
light chain kinase. in addition, the effects of the
same drugs on two processes that are regulated by
myosin phosphorylation,
namely actin-activated
myosin mg 2+-atpase activity and myosin filament
assembly, were examined.

(0.15 ml) were withdrawn at 5, 10,15,20,25,30,40,
50 and 60 min for quantification of [3zp]pi incorporation as previously described [23]. the remainder
of each reaction was quenched at 65 min by addition
of an equal volume (0.15 ml) of sds gel sample
buffer [25 mm tris-hcl (ph 6.8), 0.5% (w/v) sds,

(0.5 ml) were withdrawn at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,6 and 7 min
for quantification of [32p]pi released as previously
described [24].
myosinfilument assembly. the reversible assembly
of smooth muscle myosin into filaments was verified
by incubating myosin (2.1 ,um) at 21” in 25 mm trishcl (ph 7.5), 0.15 m kcl, 10 mm mgclr, 0.2 mm
egta, 0.25 mm dtt, 38.4 nm myosin light chain
kinase in a reaction volume of 1.0 ml. under these
conditions, myosin exists in filamentous form. myosin filament assembly-disassembly
was monitored by
recording a340nm[25]. filaments were disassembled
by addition of 2.5 mm atp and induced to
reassemble by addition of cac12 (0.1 mm excess over
egta) and 1 pm calmodulin, whereupon myosin
phosphorylation occurs. subsequent addition of partially purified myosin light chain phosphatase (50 pl/
ml) and egta (0.1 mm excess over ca2+) leads
to filament disassembly. to examine the effects of
 xxxd2092xxx  and its analogues on myosin filament
assembly-disassembly,
myosin
filaments
were
initially formed by incubating myosin (2.1 pm) at 21”
in 25 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.5), 0.15 m kcl, 10 mm
mgc12, 0.2 mm egta, 0.25 mm d’it, 20 nm myosin light chain kinase in a reaction volume of 1 .oml.

7.5-20% polyacrylamide-gradient
slab gels (1.5 mm
thick), with a 5% acrylamide stacking gel, in the
presence of 0.1% (w/v) sds at 36ma, employing
the discontinuous buffer system of laemmli [30].
gels were stained in 45% (v/v) ethanol/lo%
(v/v) acetic acid containing 0.14% (w/v) coomassie
brilliant blue r-250 and diffusion-destained in 10%
(v/v) acetic acid. destained gels were sealed in plastic bags and autoradiographed using kodak x-omat
ar film in kodak x-omat ar cassettes fitted with
intensifying screens. films were allowed to develop
for 1 week or less at room temperature. scanning
densitometry of destained gels was carried out in
an lkb model 2202 ultroscan laser densitometer
equipped with a hewlett-packard model 3390a integrator. molecular weights were calculated from
mobilities in sds/7.5-20% polyacrylamide-gradient

 xxxd1773xxx  phosphodiesterase. we initiated this
study by examining the effects of  xxxd2092xxx  and its
analogues on the activity of calmodulin-stimulated
camp phosphodiesterase. it was decided to examine
such effects in the presence and absence of la3+,
since mills and johnson [6] have shown that la3+
enhances the affinity of calmodulin for  xxxd2092xxx  by
approximately 20-fold, with half-maximal effect at
8pm la3+. it was therefore necessary initially to
determine whether la3+ has any effect directly on
the calmodulin-stimulated
camp phosphodiesterase. figure 2a indicates an inhibitory effect of 20 pm
la3+ on the phosphodiesterase
in a time-course
assay. the dose-response curve in fig. 2b indicates
a linear relationship
between phosphodiesterase
activity and la3+ concentration. the mean percent
inhibition (&sd) at 20 pm lac13 was determined to
be 37.4 + 4.7% (n = 6). la3+ can substitute for ca2+
in activating camp phosphodiesterase,
although

activation by la3+ is not as great as by caz+:
phosphodiesterase
activity in the presence of
0.11 mm ca2+ was 15.9pmol pi * mine1 . mg-’ and
in the presence of 2opm la3+ was 13.7pmol
pi * min-’ . mg-*. chelation of metal ions with
egta reduced the hydrolysis rate to 2.8pmol
pi . min-’ * mg-*.
subsequent experiments designed to investigate
the effects of  xxxd2092xxx  and its analogues on camp
phosphodiesterase
activity were carried out in the
presence and absence of 20 pm laci,.
the dose-response
curves in fig. 3 illustrate the
effects of  xxxd2092xxx  (a), and its p-chloro (b), oxidized (c) and t-butyl (d) analogues on the ca2+/
calmodulin-dependent
camp phosphodiesterase
both in the presence and absence of la3+. these
data illustrate several points: (1) in the absence of
la3+,  xxxd2092xxx  and the p-chloro analogue completely inhibited the phosphodiesterase,
with 1c5,,
values of 3.7 and 1.5 pm respectively. on the other
hand, little inhibition by the oxidized and t-butyl
analogues was observed until high concentrations
( 10-5-10-4 m) were reached. (2) similar results were
obtained in the presence of la3+, inhibition by  xxxd2092xxx  and the p-chloro analogue occurring with
1~50 values of 2.8 and 1.1 pm respectively.

analogue inhibited the basal activity (the activity
observed in the absence of ca*+) of camp phosphodiesterase as well as the ca*+/calmodulin-stimulated
activity. (4) la3+ did not inhibit the basal activity, but
did cause partial inhibition of the ca*+/calmodulinstimulated activity as seen in fig. 2. (5) inhibition
by the highest concentrations
of  xxxd2092xxx  or pchloro analogue used (5.56 x 10e5 m) could not be
reversed by calmodulin (table 1). however, the
partial inhibition observed at high concentrations of
the oxidized and t-butyl analogue was reversed by
calmodulin, although only partially in the case of the
oxidized derivative in the absence of la3+ (table 1).
this last point was investigated in more detail by
studying the effect of varying calmodulin concentration on camp phosphodiesterase
activity in
the presence of 55.6 ,um  xxxd2092xxx  (which gave
almost complete inhibition at 30 nm calmodulin) and
2.78pm  xxxd2092xxx  (which gave approx. 32% inhibition at 30 nm calmodulin) (fig. 4). calmodulin
induced complete reversal of inhibition at the low
drug concentration,
but only partial reversal at the
high drug concentration.
the data in fig. 3 indicated inhibition of the basal
(ca*+ -independent)
activity of camp phosphodiesterase by  xxxd2092xxx  and the p-chloro analogue.
this conclusion was substantiated in a separate series
of experiments
using a preparation
of camp
phosphodiesterase that was partially proteolysed by
an endogenous proteinase. limited proteolysis of
camp phosphodiesterase results in loss of the ca*+and calmodulin-dependence
of the enzymatic activity
[34]. this preparation exhibited a specific activity of
13.0 ,umol pi released . mine1 . (mg enzyme)-’ in the

activity to 1.5 and 1.9 pmol pi . min-’ . mg-‘, respectively, whether measured in the presence or absence
of ca*+/calmodulin.
caldesmon kinase. the effects of  xxxd2092xxx  and
the three analogues on ca*+/calmodulin-dependent
caldesmon kinase activity are shown in fig. 5.  xxxd2092xxx  and the p-chloro analogue inhibited this

was observed at concentrations of the oxidized or tbutyl analogue as high as 55.6 pm. the gel inset (fig.

manner and its inhibition by  xxxd2092xxx  and the pchloro analogue, but not by the oxidized or t-butyl

calmodulin concentration from 1 nm to 1 pm (data

figure 6 illustrates the effects of  xxxd2092xxx  and
the three analogues on myosin light chain kinase
activity using the isolated lc& as substrate.  xxxd2092xxx  and the p-chloro analogue inhibited myosin
light chain kinase with icky= 12.6 ,um. no significant
inhibition was observed at concentrations of the oxidized and t-butyl analogues up to 55.6 pm. inhibition
by  xxxd2092xxx  or thep-chloro analogue was overcome
completely by raising the calmodulin concentration
from 0.5 nm to 0.1 pm (data not shown).
similar results were obtained if intact myosin
rather than the isolated lc20 was used as substrate
for the myosin light chain kinase (fig. 7).  xxxd2092xxx 
and the p-chloro analogue inhibited myosin light
chain kinase activity with lcso = 11 .opm. no significant inhibition by the oxidized and t-butyl analogues
was observed, except at the highest concentrations

of the t-butyl analogue used, where partial inhibition
was observed. inhibition by  xxxd2092xxx  or the pchloro analogue was overcome completely by raising
the calmodulin concentration from 1 nm to 0.1 pm
(data not shown).
actin-activated myosin mg*+-atpase. the effects
of  xxxd2092xxx  and its analogues on the actin-activated
mg*+-atpase of smooth muscle myosin were examined in a system reconstituted from purified actin,
myosin, tropomyosin, calmodulin and myosin light
chain kinase. in an initial series of experiments
(table 2),  xxxd2092xxx  and the p-chloro analogue
induced substantial inhibition of the actin-activated
myosin mg *+-atpase (70.2 and 73.3% inhibition
respectively) at 1 nm calmodulin. this correlated
with comparable inhibition (76.5% in each case) of
myosin phosphorylation.
on the other hand, the
oxidized and t-butyl analogues did not inhibit either
myosin phosphorylation or the actin-activated myosin mg*+-atpase under identical conditions. the
inhibition by  xxxd2092xxx  and the p-chloro analogue
of both myosin phosphorylation and actin-activated
myosin mg*+-atpase activity was prevented by
increasing the calmodulin concentration
to 1 pm
(table 2).

discussion

ca” channel blocking drugs such as  xxxd2092xxx  and
related dihydropyridines
are effective vasodilating
agents. their abilities to inhibit smooth muscle contraction are thought to be due largely to their effects
on the kinetics of cazc influx through caz+ channels
[3], but several observations have suggested an
additional, intracellular mechanism of action of these
compounds. for example, ca*+ antagonists have
been shown to induce relaxation in several smooth
muscle preparations
at doses lower than those
required to inhibit ca2+ influx or action potentials
[4,36].  xxxd2092xxx  inhibits contractile activity to a
greater extent than electrical membrane discharge,
suggesting inhibition of action potential discharge
but also a later (intracellular) step in the control of

contractions in the rat portal vein [l]. furthermore,
ca2+ antagonists could inhibit contractions induced
in the absence of extraceilular cazf [37], and  xxxd2092xxx , in concentrations that prevented contraction, does not influence cellular uptake of “scai*
[4] or 45ca*+ binding and accumulation in isolated
vascular sarcolemmal vesicles [l]. finally, whereas
the membrane-permeable
ca2+ antagonist methoxyverapamil is effective whether applied extra- or intracellularly, its membrane-impermeable
quaternary
amine derivative is effective only following intracellular injection 1381. similarly, the charged pyridinium analogue of nifedipine is quite ineffective in
inhibiting the response of guinea pig ileal longitudinal smooth muscle to a supramaximal muscarinic
stimulation
(391. it is possible, however, that
dihydropyridine
ca*+ channel blockers may exert

fig. 9. myosin filament assembly-disassembly. the reversible assembly of smooth muscle myosin into filaments was
verified as described in materials and methods. filament
assembly-disassembly
was monitored by recording the
filaments of nona 340nm of the solution. pre-formed
phosphorylated myosin were induced to disassemble by
addition of atp, as shown by the decrease in ama,.
subsequent addition of ca2+ and calmodulin activated the
myosin light chain kinase (present with the myosin from
the outset), leading to myosin phosphorylation and filament
reassembly. subsequent addition of myosin light chain
phosphatase and egta (to inactivate the kinase) resulted
in myosin dephosphorylation
and filament disassembly.
the reversible phosphorylation of myosin was verified by
urea/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

by binding to an intracellular
site on the
channel.
the dihydropyridines
are markedly hydrophobic
compounds and therefore are able to penetrate the
sarcolemma easily and accumulate within the cell.
studies of [14c] xxxd2092xxx  uptake indicated a tissue :
medium ratio of 200: 1 to 500: 1 [l]. the plasma
concentration of  xxxd2092xxx  is 5-30 nm during antihypertensive therapy in patients [40] as well as in
spontaneously hypertensive rats [41]. intracellular
concentrations of  xxxd2092xxx  up to -15 pm, therefore, can occur.  xxxd2092xxx  was found to bind to a
protein of m, 15-20 kd present in a crude actomyosin preparation derived from porcine aorta, and
ca*+-dependent binding of  xxxd2092xxx  to isolated
calmodulin was demonstrated [4] with two binding
sites per mol  xxxd2092xxx  and kd = 8.5 to 22 pm
[5,42]. calmodulin plays a central role in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction through its regulation of myosin light chain kinase activity [43,44].
stimulation of the cell leads to an elevation of sarcoplasmic [ca2+], whereupon ca*+ binds to calmodulin
inducing a conformational change in the ca*+-bindconformation,

ing
protein.
in
its
cai+ . calmodulin can interact with and activate the
enzyme myosin light chain kinase which catalyzes
the phosphorylation of serine-19 on each of the two

their effects

20 kd light chains of smooth muscle myosin. this
phosphorylation leads to rapid cross-bridge cycling
and the development
of tension. biochemically,
myosin phospho lation results in actin-activation
of the myosin mgy +-atpase and superprecipitation
(the increase in turbidity observed as actin and myosin filaments interact). blockage of calmodulin-myosin light chain kinase interaction by calmodulin
antagonists could then prevent target enzyme activation and smooth muscle contraction. such a possible additional mechanism of action of  xxxd2092xxx  was
originally suggested by bostriim et al. [4].
calmodulin is known to regulate the activities of
several enzymes in addition to myosin light chain
kinase. two enzymes that have been implicated in
the regulation of smooth muscle contraction are
camp phosphodiesterase [45] and caldesmon kinase
[21, 461. inactivation of both of these enzymes, like
myosin light chain kinase, would be predicted to
favour the relaxed state of the muscle.
in this study, we have examined the effects of
 xxxd2092xxx  and three analogues (p-chloro, oxidized
and t-butyl) on the activities of these three calmodulin-dependent
enzymes:
camp phosphodiesterase, caldesmon kinase and myosin light chain
kinase. these four compounds differ in pharmacological potency: picj0 (-log k&j) values for
inhibition of contraction of rat portal vein were 7.4
( xxxd2092xxx ), 5.2 @-chloro analogue), 4.6 (oxidized
 xxxd2092xxx ) and ~4.5 (t-butyl analogue) (b. ljung,
personal communication,
cited with permission).
the two weakest analogues (oxidized and t-butyl
derivatives) had little, if any, effect on the activities
of the three calmodulin-dependent
enzymes, nor did
they affect actin-activated
myosin mg*+-atpase
activity, superprecipitation,
or myosin filament
assembly.  xxxd2092xxx ,
however, inhibited camp
phosphodiesterase,
caldesmon kinase, myosin light
chain kinase and a&in-activated
myosin mg*+atpase, as well as myosin filament assembly induced
by a low concentration of calmodulin. the lcso values
were similar to the concentrations
of  xxxd2092xxx 
which can occur intracellularly in vivo (see above).
the in vitro inhibitory effects of  xxxd2092xxx  are therefore specific and qualitatively resemble the pharmafologica1 effects on the contractile properties of
the rat portal vein. structural alterations such as
oxidation of the dihydropyridine ring or replacement
of the methyl and ethyl ester side chains with t-butyl
groups result in a substantial loss of pharmacological
potency and ability to inhibit calmodulin-dependent
enzymes and processes. however, movement of the
ortho chlorine atom of  xxxd2092xxx  to thepara position
results in a significant loss of pharmacological
potency, but no loss of capacity to inhibit calmodulindependent enzymes and processes. the reason for
this discrepancy is unknown, although it may reflect
the fact that the primary pharmacological site of
action of  xxxd2092xxx  is the voltage-operated
ca*+
channel, whereas calmodulin and calmodulin-regulated enzymes represent a secondary, and quantitatively less important, site of action.
a correlation has been observed between the
affinities of  xxxd2092xxx  and a variety of structural
analogues for calmodulin and the hydrophobicities
of the compounds (j. d. johnson, personal com-

munication, cited with permission). thus, the t-butyl
analogue has a much higher affinity (& = 0.3 pm)
for calmodulin than does  xxxd2092xxx  (kd = 9 pm).
it is clear that no such correlation exists between
hydrophobicity and capacity to inhibit calmodulinstimulated enzymes and processes, or contraction of
rat portal vein smooth muscle. studies of tryptic
digestion of calmodulin in the presence of bound
drugs suggest that  xxxd2092xxx  and the t-butyl analogue
bind to different sites on calmodulin, which could
explain why the t-butyl analogue binds tightly to
calmodulin but has no effect on its ability to activate
target enzymes (h. vogel, personal communication,
cited with permission).
the results described herein support a possible
mechanism of action of  xxxd2092xxx  which involves
its ca*+-dependent interaction with calmodulin and
consequent
inhibition
of calmodulin-dependent
enzymes such as camp phosphodiesterase,
caldesmon kinase, and myosin light chain kinase. such
inhibitory effects would favour the relaxed state of
the smooth muscle and therefore vasodilation.
in conclusion, current understanding of the mechanism of action of  xxxd2092xxx  indicates a primary
action of the dihydropyridine
on voltage-operated
ca2+ channels with additional, secondary sites of
action within the vascular smooth muscle cell. calmodulin and calmodulin-regulated
enzymatic systems may represent one such secondary site of action
of  xxxd2092xxx  and related dihydropyridines.
