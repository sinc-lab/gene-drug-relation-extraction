background: a recent theory of anesthesia predicts that some endogenous compounds should have anesthetic properties. this theory raises the possibility that
metabolites that are profoundly elevated in disease may also exert anesthetic
effects. because in pathophysiologic concentrations, ammonia reversibly impairs
memory, consciousness, and responsiveness to noxious stimuli in a manner similar
to anesthetics, we investigated whether ammonia had anesthetic properties.
methods: the effect of ammonia was studied on ␣1␤2 and ␣1␤2␥2s ␥-amino butyric
acid type a, ␣1 glycine, and nr1/ xxxg964xxx  n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, and the
two-pore domain  xxxg1232xxx  tresk. channels were expressed in xenopus
laevis oocytes and studied using two-electrode voltage clamping. the immobilizing
effect of ammonia in rats was evaluated by determining the reduction in isoflurane
minimum alveolar concentration produced by iv infusion of ammonium chloride.
the olive oil–water partition coefficient was measured to determine whether free
ammonia (nh3) followed the meyer-overton relation.
results: ammonia positively modulated tresk channels and glycine receptors.
no effect was seen on ␣1␤2 and ␣1␤2␥2s ␥-amino butyric acid type a receptors or
nr1/ xxxg964xxx  n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. ammonia reversibly decreased the
requirement for isoflurane, with a calculated immobilizing ec50 of 1.6 ⫾ 0.1 mm
nh4cl. the ostwald olive oil–water partition coefficient for nh3 was 0.018. at a
ph of 7.4, and at the anesthetic ec50, the nh3 concentration in bulk olive oil is 0.42
␮m, approximately five orders of magnitude less than observed by anesthetics that
follow the meyer-overton relation.
conclusions: these findings support the hypothesis that ammonia has anesthetic
properties. bulk oil concentration did not predict the potency of ammonia.

a

recent theory of anesthesia predicts specific endogenous compounds that may have anesthetic properties (1) via indirect actions on ion channels in high,
nonspecific concentrations. a corollary to this theory
is the possibility that a variety of other endogenous
compounds may, in high concentrations, also have
anesthetic properties. a variety of metabolites are
profoundly elevated in certain diseases associated
with impaired responsiveness, such as liver failure (2),
uremia (3), and diabetic ketoacidosis (4); we conjecture
that some of these metabolites, prominent among
which is ammonia, may be acting as anesthetics.
ammonia is a product of protein catabolism which,
in mammals, is metabolized in the liver to urea by

enzymes of the urea cycle. humans with liver failure
(2) or urea cycle disorders (4) develop symptoms
ranging from mild confusion, through drowsiness and
sleep to coma. elevated ammonia concentrations are a
feature of these conditions and correlate with disease
severity (5). in the case of liver failure, therapies are
available (e.g., liver transplantation) and these therapies demonstrate that the symptoms are reversible.
for these reasons, we hypothesized that ammonia has
anesthetic properties. we tested this by demonstrating
that ammonia produces the stereotypic features of
inhaled anesthetics on ion channels and in animals.
those features include enhancement of currents
through inhibitory anesthetic-sensitive ion channels,
and a reversible reduction in the requirement for a
conventional inhaled anesthetic in rats.

methods
our institutional animal care and use committee
approved all studies involving animals.

ion channel physiology
ion channel expression in xenopus laevis oocytes, and
two electrode voltage clamp study of tresk channels
and n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptors were performed as described previously (6).
␥- xxxd2177xxx  type a (gabaa)and glycine
receptors were expressed and studied using similar
vol. 104, no. 6, june 2007

methods (7). human gabaa ␣1 and ␥2s and the rat
gabaa ␤2 subunits in pcis ii vectors, and human ␣1
glycine receptors in a pbk-cmv vector, were a gift
from professor r.a. harris. approximately 1 ng total
plasmid, consisting of equal parts gabaa ␣1 and ␤2
receptor subunits, and a 10-fold excess of ␥2s, or of the
␣1 subunit of the  xxxg904xxx , were injected into
the nucleus of frog oocytes and studied 1– 4 days later.
expression of gabaa receptors containing the ␥2s
subunit was tested by application of 10 ␮m zinc
chloride for 1 min followed by coapplication of zinc
chloride with gaba, and observing inhibition of
currents by 10% or less.
oocytes were perfused with frog ringer’s solution
for 5 min, and then frog ringer’s solution containing
agonist (0.03 mm gaba or 0.075 mm glycine) for 20 s;
this was repeated three times. nh4cl in frog ringer’s
solution was perfused for 100 s followed by the same
concentration in frog ringer’s solution plus agonist.
reversibility was verified after washout with frog
ringer’s solution. solutions were made fresh daily
and ph adjusted.

general anesthetic effects in rats
to determine whether ammonia was an anesthetic in animals, we tested whether ammonia could
reduce the concentration of a conventional inhaled
anesthetic, isoflurane, required to cause immobility in
19 crl:cd威(sd)br rats. after determining the anesthetic concentration for isoflurane (i.e., mac, for
minimum alveolar concentration producing immobility in response to a supramaximal stimulus) using
previously described methods (8), 1.5 m nh4cl was
administered iv at approximately 10 ml 䡠 kg⫺1 䡠 h⫺1
over 60 –75 min in rats inhaling subanesthetic concentrations of isoflurane. one molar nahco3 was coadministered intraperitoneally at the same rate. at the
end of the infusions, the presence or absence of
movement in response to a supramaximal tail clamp
was assessed, inspired isoflurane concentrations were
measured, animals were killed and blood was collected for ammonia, blood gas, and electrolyte analysis. additional animals were studied with isoflurane
alone (table 1). a logistic regression analysis (9) was
used to solve the concentration of total ammonia alone
that produced anesthesia in rats administered both
isoflurane and nh4cl and only isoflurane.

measurement of ammonia’s partition coefficient
ammonia’s olive oil partition coefficient was measured in quadruplicate by shaking 25 ml 1 m nh4 at
ph 7.4 with 50 ml extra-light olive oil (bertoli, unilever, nv) for 2 h at 37°c. the unionized ammonia in
this solution was calculated from the hendersonhasselbach equation. the emulsion was centrifuged
and 40 ml of oil removed and shaken with 40 ml of
fresh water at ph 4.0. the ammonium in this water
was measured using an ion selective electrode (omega
engineering, stamford, ct), and assumed to equal all

the ammonia originally dissolved in the oil. the
oil–water partition coefficient was the concentration
ratio of unionized ammonia (nh3)in the oil to that in
the original aqueous solution.

results
effects of ammonia on ion channel function
we applied ammonium chloride in millimolar concentrations to expressed ion channels, because animal
models of hyperammonemia from liver failure report
total ammonia (nh⫹
4 ⴙ nh3) concentrations in this
range (10); this compares to normal total ammonia
concentrations, which are ⬍40 ␮m (11). we found that
at concentrations of 1 mm and larger, the function of
strychnine-sensitive, glycine receptors was enhanced
(fig. 1). we also found that nh4cl enhanced currents
through the anesthetic-sensitive two-pore domain potassium leak channel tresk (12) in a concentrationdependent manner above 3 mm (fig. 2). thus, both
glycine receptors and tresk channels were affected in a
manner similar to conventional inhaled anesthetics.
there was no effect of nh4cl on ␣1␤2 or ␣1␤2␥2s
␥- xxxd2177xxx  type a (gabaa) receptors or
nmda receptors comprising nr1/ xxxg964xxx  subunits, at
nh4cl concentrations up to 10 mm.

applied isoflurane concentrations ranged from

hence, the effects of ammonium on isoflurane mac
were reversible.

oil solubility
the ostwald olive oil–water partition coefficient for
nh3 was 0.018. at a ph of 7.4, given that the pka of
ammonia is 9.24, the bulk olive oil concentration of nh3
in equilibrium with the 1.6 mm aqueous anesthetic
concentration of nh4cl is calculated to be 0.42 ␮m.

discussion
figure 1. anesthetic-like effects of nh4cl on currents through

strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors. xenopus laevis oocytes
expressing homomeric human ␣1 glycine receptors were exposed to nh4cl for 100 s, or perfusates containing an isosmotic
concentration of sucrose. six oocytes were studied at 1 mm, 5 at
2.5 mm, 7 at 5 mm, and 6  xxxd1891xxx  mm nh4cl. nh4cl at all
concentrations studied enhanced (potentiated) chloride current
through this receptor in response to coapplication of 75 ␮m
glycine with nh4cl for 20 s.

figure 2. anesthetic-like effects of nh4cl on currents through

tresk two-pore domain potassium channels. xenopus laevis
oocytes expressing human tresk channels were studied by
two electrode voltage clamping. six oocytes were studied at
each concentration of nh4cl. exposure to 6, 9, and 12 mm
nh4cl significantly enhanced currents at ⫹60 mv compared
to isosmotic sucrose controls.

chloride infusions, with an average of 0.9 mm. the
nh4cl infusion decreased isoflurane mac by an
average of 60%. the calculated ec50 ⫾ se for ammonium chloride was 1.6 ⫾ 0.1 mm, and for isoflurane,
1.52% ⫾ 0.06% atm. at doses larger than those we
used, rats developed pulmonary edema; consequently,
enough nh4cl to achieve anesthesia by itself could not
be infused. blood chemistry was within normal limits,
with a mean (⫾se) arterial blood ph, base deficit, and
plasma potassium concentration of 7.39 ⫾ 0.02, ⫺0.6 ⫾
1.2, and 5.8 ⫾ 0.3 mmol/l, respectively. arterial po2
was 461 ⫾ 15 mm hg, and all animals were normocapneic. blood osmotic pressure was only modestly
increased at 320 ⫾ 3 mmol/kg.
the reversibility of the nh4cl effect was determined in six rats. isoflurane mac was determined to
be 1.61% ⫾ 0.04% atm (mean ⫾ se) in these animals,
but only 0.06% ⫾ 0.07% higher 1 day after nh4cl
infusion, a value not significantly different than baseline.

ammonia has anesthetic properties

our results show that ammonia has anesthetic
properties: ammonia had a mac-sparing effect in rats,
and was found to enhance the function of two
anesthetic-sensitive ion channels with inhibitory effects, the strychnine-sensitive  xxxg904xxx  and the
two-pore domain k⫹ channel tresk.
we chose to study the effect of ammonia on mac
because unresponsiveness to painful stimuli is seen in
patients with elevated ammonia levels (13). we studied the effect of ammonia on ion channels which have
been demonstrated to be sensitive to anesthetics, because these channels are thought to be molecular
targets mediating anesthetic actions. these included
glycine receptors, which are pentameric chloride
channels in the same receptor superfamily as the
gabaa receptor. these receptors are important because they are the major mediators of inhibitory
neurotransmission in the hindbrain and spinal cord,
and inhaled anesthetics and ethanol at 1 mac have
been shown to enhance the action of glycine on
glycine receptors (14,15). these studies also included
the human tresk channel, which is a two-pore
domain potassium leak channel formed from dimers
of pore-forming units, each containing four transmembrane segments and two tandem p domains (the
putative pore-forming region) (16). tresk currents
are enhanced by volatile anesthetics (12). the enhancement of  xxxg904xxx  and tresk channel function
we observed may contribute to the central nervous
system depression seen in diseases in which ammonia
is elevated, such as fulminant hepatic failure and urea
cycle disorders. more generally, our findings suggest
that other ion channels or subtypes of channels we
have not studied, and which respond to anesthetics,
may contribute to the central nervous system depression found in hyperammonemic disorders.
surprisingly, we did not find an effect of nh4cl on
␣1␤2 or ␣1␤2␥2s gabaa receptors or nmda receptors
comprising nr1/ xxxg964xxx  subunits, at nh4cl concentrations up to 10 mm. this contrasts with previous
investigations, which reported enhancement of gabaa
receptor function with 1 mm (nh⫹
4 in dissociated cortical neurons (17), and a nmda receptor response to
ammonia (18). possibly, different subtypes of receptors
than ours were present on neurons in these studies.
we asked whether nh3 was exerting the observed
anesthetic effects in a manner similar to conventional
volatile anesthetics, rather than (nh⫹
4 which is the
anesthesia & analgesia

predominant form of ammonia present during infusion. conventional volatile anesthetics have bulk oil
phase concentrations of 25–50 mm at their anesthetizing concentrations (the meyer-overton relation (19).
we measured the ostwald olive oil–water partition
coefficient of nh3, finding it to be 0.018. this corresponds to a bulk oil phase concentration of 0.42 ␮m
nh3 at an anesthetizing concentration of nh4cl (1.6
mm; see above) at a physiologic ph of 7.4. this is
approximately five orders of magnitude lower than
that observed with conventional inhaled anesthetics.
this indicates that the anesthetic-like effects we observed were probably not from free ammonia acting
like a conventional inhaled anesthetic.
the concentrations of ammonia we used in our
studies were in the range that produces hyperammonemic symptoms in animal models (10). this is
higher than that found in humans with hepatic failure.
however, in fuminant hepatic failure, a wide variety
of metabolites are elevated, and these may add to the
depressant effect of lower concentrations of ammonia.
ammonium chloride infusions produced a hyperosmolar state. this however cannot explain our finding of
a decreased mac for isoflurane during ammonium
chloride infusion. for example, previous studies of
infusion of 12% dextrose in dogs increased osmolarity
from 306 to 359, but did not change mac (20).
administration of 25% dextrose changed osmolarity
from 301 to 370, but also did not change mac
significantly. thus, osmolarity alone does not change
mac. the aforementioned increases were not accompanied by an increase in sodium in the cerebrospinal
fluid (csf). when hypertonic saline or mannitol was
infused and sodium in the csf increased, mac increased. thus, if anything, an increased osmolarity
through an increased csf sodium should increase
mac, but we found a decrease in mac.
in summary, these results are significant because
they 1) show that ammonia has anesthetic properties
which, in disease, may contribute to central nervous
system depression, 2), suggest that ion channels which
mediate anesthetic actions may contribute to impaired
responsiveness in liver failure and other hyperammonemic disorders, and 3) potentially identify a new
class of molecules with anesthetic properties.
