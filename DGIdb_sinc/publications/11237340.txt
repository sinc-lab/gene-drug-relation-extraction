determination of homocysteine levels in cells and
serum is important because high homocysteine is a
risk factor for cardiovascular disease. the currently
used methods for homocysteine analysis either are
time consuming or rely on the use of expensive equipment. described in this study is an enzymatic assay
that determines levels of homocysteine in multiple
samples in less than 30 min at levels from 5 to 50 pmol
using only a spectrophotometer. the reproducibility
of the assay is consistent with the other methods currently used. a second assay, that is about 5-fold more
sensitive, follows the enzymatic catalyzed solvent exchange of protons on glycine, which requires a scintillation counter. both the spectrophotometric and the
radiometric methods are based on the conversion of
5-methyltetrahydrofolate to  xxxd3334xxx  by  xxxg1479xxx . the  xxxd3334xxx  is formed in
stoichiometric amounts to the homocysteine in the
sample. in the spectrophotometric method the  xxxd3334xxx  is used at catalytic levels by three enzymes to form a metabolic cycle that generates
nadph from nadp ⴙ. in the radiometric assay  xxxd3334xxx  is required for the enzymatic exchange of
the pro 2s proton of glycine with solvent. l-cysteine,
at levels more than 30-fold higher than the upper level
of homocysteine used in these assays, does not give
any measurable response. © 2001 academic press

sclerosis, preclampsia, and diabetes, and often during
aging. it has also been implicated as a predictive
risk factor for cardiovascular disease (1– 4 and refs.
therein). as studies on the levels of hcys and its reactions with other cell components continue there is an
increasing need for rapid, accurate, and sensitive
methods for analysis, both in serum and in cell culture
experiments.
currently there are several methods available for
determining hcys levels in tissue extracts (5–7 and
refs. therein). all of these methods exhibit sufficient
accuracy and sensitivity for current research interests,
but they also have weaknesses related to either time
and labor involved in the analysis, the need for an
expensive instrument, or the cost of a commercial kit.
much of the hcys in serum is present either as disulfides with other small thiol compounds, such as glutathione and cysteine, or as conjugates of proteins. each
method requires a preincubation to reduce these disulfides to generate free hcys.
we have developed two enzymatic assays (methods
a and b) for the rapid and sensitive determination of
hcys in biological fluids, cell extracts, and cell culture
media. the methods are based on the  xxxg1479xxx  conversion of hcys to methionine with the resultant conversion of 5-ch 3-h 4pteglu 4 to h 4pteglu 4
(scheme 1a). the h 4pteglu n is then determined in a
series of reactions which require only catalytic
amounts of h 4pteglu n . in method a, h 4pteglu n is
used to convert serine to glycine and co 2 by three
enzymes that form a cycle and regenerate h 4pteglu n
(scheme 1b). during each cycle two molecules of
nadp ⫹ are converted to nadph, which can be measured by absorbance at 340 nm. the rate of the cycle
and nadph formation is directly proportional to the
amount of h 4pteglu n , and thus to the amount of hcys
in the sample being tested. in this study we reduce all
disulfides prior to determination so reported values are
for total hcys.

the amount of h 4pteglu n formed in the methionine
synthase reaction can also be determined by its requirement at catalytic levels in the escherichia coli
serine hydroxymethyltransferase catalyzed solvent exchange of the pro 2s proton of [2- 3h]glycine (method b
and scheme 1c). the rate of exchange of the glycine
proton is directly proportional to the level of h 4pteglu n
when excess serine hydroxymethyltransferase is used.
thus the rate of proton exchange can be related to the
level of hcys in a biological sample. we report here
that these two assays for hcys are rapid, sensitive, and
reproducible.
materials and methods

materials and solutions. all buffers, amino acids,
coenzymes, and nabh 4 were obtained from sigma (st.
louis, mo). all culture media were obtained from
gibco (gaithersburg, md). (6s)5-ch 3-h 4pteglu was
a gift from eprova ag (schaffhausen, switzerland). a
solution of [2- 3h]glycine (25 ci/mmol from amersham,
arlington heights, il) was purified and prepared as a
stock solution of 0.4 mm glycine containing 5 ⫻ 10 8
cpm/ml as previously described (8). hcys serum standards were obtained from utak laboratories (valencia,
ca).
(6s)5-ch 3-h 4pteglu 4 was prepared by incubating
(6s)5-ch 3-h 4pteglu with human folylpolyglutamate
synthetase (kindly provided by dr. r. moran), glutamate, and atp. 5-ch 3-h 4pteglu, 120 nmol, was incubated with 300 ␮l of 200 mm tris 䡠 hcl, ph 9.0,
containing 8 ␮g folylpolyglutamate synthetase, 20 mm
glutamate, 20 mm mgcl 2, 30 mm kcl, 10 mm atp,
210 ␮g bovine  xxxg124xxx , and 20 mm  xxxd26xxx  at 30°c. after a 6-h incubation, an additional
2 ␮g of folylpolyglutamate synthetase was added to the
reaction and incubated for an additional 2 h. as judged
from an hplc elution profile on a c4-reverse-phase
column, about 90% of the product was the tetraglutamate form with the remaining being equally divided
between the tri- and pentaglutamate derivatives (data
not shown). the reaction solution was then passed
through a 0.8 ⫻ 25 cm p2 molecular sieve column

equilibrated with 20 mm sodium n-[2-hydroxyethyl]piperazine-n⬘-[2-ethanesulfonate](nahepes),
ph 7.3, containing 100 mm  xxxd26xxx  (9). the
first fractions containing the 5-ch 3-h 4pteglu n were
pooled and concentrated by vacuum centrifugation
about twofold to give a final 5 mm solution, which was
stored in the nahepes buffer with 100 mm  xxxd26xxx  at ⫺20°c. this solution is stable for several
months. the concentration of the (6s)5-ch 3h 4pteglu n was determined by either its maximum absorbance at 290 nm or its ability to form an abortive
complex with serine hydroxymethyltransferase and
glycine that absorbs intensely at 502 nm (8). prior to
use in the hcys assays an aliquot of the stock (6s) xxxd2069xxx  3-h 4pteglu 4 solution was diluted in nahepes, ph
7.3, containing 100 mm  xxxd26xxx  to a final
concentration of 0.2 mm.
hcys disulfides were reduced by the addition of small
aliquots of either a 10 mm nabh 4 solution (made in
 xxxd102xxx  containing 0.2 m sodium hydroxide
and stored at ⫺20°c) or a freshly prepared 100 mm
dithiothreitol stock solution.
purification of enzymes. e. coli cobalamin-independent  xxxg1479xxx  was purified from an overexpressing clone in e. coli that was kindly provided by
dr. r. matthews (10). both e. coli and rabbit liver
cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase were expressed and purified from clones as published (11, 12).
 xxxg131xxx  was purified from fresh frozen rabbit liver (pel-freeze biologicals, rogers, ak) as previously described (13).
e. coli 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase was expressed and purified from e. coli. the
activity was determined by observing the increase in
absorbance at 340 nm during the conversion of 5,10methylene–h 4pteglu (0.2 mm) and nadp ⫹ (0.5 mm)
in 20 mm nahepes, ph 7.3, to 10-formyl–h 4pteglu
and nadph. the e. coli fold gene coding for the
bifunctional 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase
(ec 1.5.1.5) was amplified by pcr from e. coli k-12
genomic dna using the following primers: cctctctcatatggcagcaaagattattgacgg and cgcgaattcgccatgttactcatcctgtggatc (gibco
brl). these primers also inserted restriction sites for
ndei and ecori (underlined) used to clone the gene
into the pet22b(⫹) expression vector (novagen). a
single colony of the transformed e. coli hms174(de3)
cells containing the pet22b(⫹)::fold gene was inoculated in 2 ml of lb medium containing 100 ␮g/ml of
ampicillin and grown overnight at 37°c. this was used
to inoculate 1 liter of the same medium and cells were
then grown at 37°c until od 600 reached 1.2, after
which iptg was added to a final concentration of 0.5
mm and growth continued for an additional 4 h. cells

were harvested by centrifugation and the pellet resuspended in 50 ml of 20 mm potassium phosphate, ph
7.2, containing 5 mm  xxxd26xxx  and 0.1 mm
edta. cells were broken by osmotic shock in an avestin cell disrupter. ammonium sulfate was added to
the cell lysate to 30% saturation (176 g/liter) and cell
debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for
25 min at 4°c. ammonium sulfate was added to the
supernatant to 55% saturation (162 g/liter). after stirring, the slurry was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 25
min at 4°c and the pellet was dissolved in about 20 ml
of 10 mm potassium phosphate, ph 7.2, containing 5
mm  xxxd26xxx  and 0.1 mm edta. the solution was desalted through a p6-dg column equilibrated with the same buffer prior to loading onto a
deae–sephadex column (3 cm ⫻ 10 cm) equilibrated
with the same buffer. the column was washed with the
equilibration buffer until the absorbance at 280 nm
was below 0.2 and the enzyme eluted with a linear
gradient of equal volumes of equilibration buffer and
100 mm potassium phosphate– 400 mm nacl, ph 6.5,
containing 5 mm  xxxd26xxx  and 0.1 mm
edta. fractions containing activity were pooled and
precipitated by 60% ammonium sulfate (390 g/liter)
and after centrifugation the pellet was dissolved and
dialyzed to remove salt. the enzyme (about 50 mg) was
diluted to 2.8 mg/ml and stored at ⫺20°c in 20 mm
potassium phosphate, ph 7.2, containing 10% glycerol,
2 mm  xxxd26xxx , and 0.1 mm edta. the enzyme was greater than 80% pure as judged by sodium
 xxxd3215xxx –polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
each enzyme used in the hcys assays can be stored
as a 10% glycerol or sucrose solution in 20 mm potassium phosphate, ph 7.3, 2 mm dithiothreitol, at ⫺20°c
for several months without significant loss of activity.
all of the reagents required for these hcys assays can
be obtained from biocache pharmaceuticals, inc.
(richmond, va).
hcys assay using nadp ⫹ (method a). prior to performing the assay two stock solutions are prepared as
follows. solution 1 contains, per ml, 2.1 mg of  xxxg1479xxx , 0.36 mg of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate
dehydrogenase, and 20 nmol of (6s)5-ch 3-h 4pteglu 4,
in 25 mm nahepes, ph 7.6, with 50 mm  xxxd26xxx . solution 2 contains, per ml, 5.6 mg of rabbit
cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase, 3.5 mg of
 xxxg131xxx , 0.5 mg of
methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, 5 mm
nadp ⫹, and 50 mm l-serine, in 25 mm nahepes with
10 mm  xxxd26xxx . these two stock solutions
are enough to perform 40 hcys assays.
a biological sample containing 5 to 50 pmol of total
hcys is placed in a 0.6 ml eppendorf vial in 20 ␮l of 25
mm nahepes, ph 7.6 (this would be 2 to 15 ␮l of an
undiluted normal serum sample). it is suggested that

361

normal serum samples be diluted 10-fold before using.
three microliters of a stock solution of 10 mm nabh 4
in ethanol and naoh is added and the solution is
incubated at 30°c for 2 min to reduce hcys disulfides
(dithiothreitol, 2 mm, can also be used as a reductant,
but because it is a poor substrate for  xxxg1479xxx  it results in a higher background by producing
small amounts of h 4pteglu 4). to this solution is added
25 ␮l of solution 1, which is incubated for 5 min at 30°c
to convert 5-ch 3-h 4pteglu 4 and hcys to methionine
and h 4pteglu 4. the 50 mm  xxxd26xxx  in solution 1 contains enough of its disulfide form to destroy
any remaining nabh 4. next, 400 ␮l of 25 mm nahepes containing 20 mm  xxxd26xxx , ph 7.6, is
added and the reaction is started by the addition of 25
␮l of solution 2. the reaction proceeds for 3 min at 30°c
before the absorbance is read at 340 nm, or the reaction
is stopped by the addition of 20 ␮l of a 10% solution of
 xxxd3215xxx  in water and then the absorbance is determined at 340 nm. the change in absorbance at 340 nm is recorded and corrected for a background reading from a reaction in which no hcys was
added. the picomoles of hcys are determined by comparing the ⌬a 340 nm to a standard curve constructed
with samples of known amounts of hcys.
radioactive hcys assay (method b). a serum or cell
extract sample (10 to 20 ␮l) is taken and made 2 mm
with freshly prepared dithiothreitol and then incubated for 2 min to reduce all hcys disulfides. (the
reductive step can also be done with nabh 4 as described for method a with a modification as described
under results to remove excess nabh 4. however, using dithiothreitol is our preferred method.) after the
2-min reduction step, 2 to 3 ␮l of this sample is removed and added to 25 ␮l of 50 mm  xxxd26xxx 
in 50 mm nahepes, ph 7.3, containing 40 ␮g of  xxxg1479xxx  and 0.2 nmol of (6s)5-ch 3h 4pteglu 4. this nearly 10-fold dilution of the serum or
cell extract sample decreases the dithiothreitol concentration so that it is not a substrate for methionine
synthase. the diluted solution is incubated for 5 min at
30°c to convert hcys and 5-ch 3-h 4pteglu 4 to methionine and h 4pteglu 4. to this solution is added 3 ␮l of
[2- 3h]glycine (1.5 ⫻ 10 6 cpm) and 10 ␮l of an 8.8 mg/ml
e. coli serine hydroxymethyltransferase solution. the
exchange of the pro 2s proton of glycine proceeds for 3
min at 30°c before the reaction is stopped by the addition of 15 ␮l of 10% trichloroacetic acid. after a brief
centrifugation in a microcentrifuge to remove the precipitated protein, the supernatant is placed on a column (0.5 ⫻ 1.0 cm) of dowex 50 and equilibrated with
10 mm hcl, and the eluate is discarded. an additional
100 ␮l of water is added to the eppendorf tube to wash
the precipitated protein and then added to the column
and the eluate collected in 7 ml of scintillation fluid

(scintiverse from fisher) in a counting vial. this procedure is repeated with a second 100 ␮l of water and
then two additional 200-␮l washes for a total of 600 ␮l
collected in the counting vial. the vial is then counted
for tritium content.
cell culture extracts. mcf 7 cells are grown in defined medium and harvested and washed two times
with phosphate-buffered saline. after centrifugation
the cell pellet is resuspended in 50 mm nahepes, ph
7.3, to a density of 1 ⫻ 10 7 cells per milliliter and then
ruptured by sonication for 30 s. dithiothreitol is added
to 2 mm to reduce all hcys disulfides during a 2-min
incubation at 30°c. the solution is placed in a boiling
water bath for 1 min and centrifuged at 14,000g for 2
min to remove denatured proteins. aliquots of the supernatant, 0.5 to 2 ␮l, are taken for hcys analysis as
described above.
results

standard curves for hcys. standard curves for both
methods a and b were determined using a stock 0.2
mm solution of l-homocystine (hcys-s-s-hcys) that
had been prepared from a vacuum dried sample dissolved in 500 ml of 20 mm nahepes, ph 7.6. the stock
solution is diluted to 1 ␮m before use in either assay.
determination of hcys at each concentration is performed in quadruplicate samples, and the results are
averaged and plotted with one standard deviation error bars (figs. 1a and 1b).
in method a the hcys-s-s-hcys is reduced to hcys
with nabh 4 in a 2-min preincubation at 30°c. it is
important that the reducing agent not be added in
great excess since it will inactivate serine hydroxymethyltransferase, which is added later. we found that
reduction of the disulfide is rapid and is not dependent
on time of incubation or small variations in the amount
of nabh 4. to this solution is added  xxxg1479xxx  and 5-ch 3-h 4pteglu 4 and the solution is incubated for 5 min at 30°c. during this period the hcys
and 5-ch 3-h 4pteglu 4 are converted to methionine and
h 4pteglu 4. it appears that complete conversion occurs
by the end of 3 min. to stabilize the h 4pteglu 4 during
the incubation a small amount of  xxxg131xxx  is added. this enzyme binds
h 4pteglu 4 tightly and stabilizes it against oxidation
(9). the volume of the reaction is kept small because
the amounts of hcys are so low. the  xxxg1479xxx  used in these experiments is the mete cobalamin
independent enzyme from e. coli. this  xxxg1479xxx  requires the triglutamate form of 5-ch 3h 4pteglu n or higher polyglutamate forms as substrate
(10). our stock solution was primarily the tetraglutamate because of the conditions we used to prepare it
(9). however, we did try 5-ch 3-h 4pteglu 3 and it works

radiometric methods (method a and b, respectively). (a) standard

the average of quadruplicate samples and the error bars are for 1 sd.

as well as the tetraglutamate, so glutamate chain
length of three or higher is adequate for this assay.
the next step in assay method a is to use the low
levels of h 4pteglu 4 generated in the preincubation to
operate the cycle shown in scheme 1b. the preincubation solution is increased by 400 ␮l by adding buffer,
and the reaction is started by the addition of 25 ␮l of a
stock solution containing rabbit cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase, methylenetetrahydrofolate
dehydrogenase,  xxxg131xxx , serine, and nadp ⫹. the increase in absorbance
due to nadph formation is followed at 340 nm for 3
min. the rate is linear with both time and concentration of hcys used in the assay. it is not required to
follow the absorbance change during the 3-min incubation. multiple samples can be assayed at the same time
and the reaction is stopped at the end of 3 min by the
addition of 20 ␮l of a 10%  xxxd3215xxx  solution. the resulting solution is clear and the absorbance
at 340 nm remains constant for the 10 min it takes to
measure the a 340 for individual reactions. each cycle
that converts serine to glycine and co 2 regenerates the
h 4pteglu 4 and produces two equivalents of nadph
(scheme 1b). the cycle operates at about 50 cycles per

homocysteine assay

minute at these low levels of h 4pteglu 4, thus giving
about a 100-fold increase in nadph concentration for
each min of reaction relative to the amount of added
h 4pteglu 4.
figure 1a shows that ⌬a 340 is linear with the original amount of hcys in the 5 to 50 pmol range. each
enzyme in the assay is in excess and small variations
in concentration do not alter the rate of the cycle. the
results are very reproducible for multiple determinations at the same concentrations showing deviations of
about 2.3%. the results also can be repeated with
different stock solutions of enzymes at several week
intervals without changing the results.
for hcys determination by method b (scheme 1c)
the conversion of the stock hcys-s-s-hcys solution to
methionine and h 4pteglu 4 is performed in an identical
manner except the amount of hcys-s-s-hcys is lowered to conform to the greater sensitivity of this assay.
the amount of serine hydroxymethyltransferase used
in the assay is also much less than used in method a.
this creates a problem since serine hydroxymethyltransferase is inactivated by nabh 4 demanding that
this reagent in the initial reduction of hcys-s-s-hcys
be completely destroyed after the reduction step. the
nabh 4 can be replaced by performing the preincubation with 2 mm dithiothreitol. however, before the
addition of  xxxg1479xxx  and 5-ch 3-h 4pteglu 4
the reduction solution must be diluted about 10-fold
since the dithiothreitol is a poor substrate for  xxxg1479xxx  and at 2 mm results in some conversion
of 5-ch 3-h 4pteglu 4 to h 4pteglu 4, which increases the
background counts in a no hcys control. if nabh 4 is
used as the reducing agent the problem of excess borohydride inactivating serine hydroxymethyltransferase
can be solved by the addition of 20 ␮l of a stock solution
of lys (1 mm) and plp (50 ␮m) in assay buffer. the
excess nabh 4 is destroyed by reducing the aldimine
formed in this solution between lys and plp. also, in
this assay e. coli serine hydroxymethyltransferase is
used in place of rabbit cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase because 5-ch 3-h 4pteglu 4 does not increase the rate of exchange of the pro 2s hydrogen of
[2- 3h]glycine, which occurs to a small extent with the
rabbit enzyme.
after conversion of 5-ch 3-h 4pteglu 4 to h 4pteglu 4
by  xxxg1479xxx  additional assay buffer is
added along with e. coli serine hydroxymethyltransferase and [2- 3h]glycine. after a 3-min incubation the
reaction is stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic
acid. the precipitated proteins are removed by a brief
centrifugation. the acidic supernatant is then added to
a small dowex-50 cation-exchange column equilibrated
in 0.01 m hcl. after this addition a 20 ml counting vial
with 7 ml of scintillation fluid is placed under the
column and an additional 600 ␮l of water is passed
through the column in aliquots of 100 to 200 ␮l. the

analyses were repeated except that to each aliquot of serum 50 pmol

the average value is plotted against the volume of serum used in the
determination. the error bars represent 1 sd.

first two 100 ␮l aliquots are used to wash the precipitated protein to remove all excess glycine and water.
the cationic glycine remains bound to the column and
the exchanged protons in the water pass through the
column into the scintillant and are counted.
figure 1b shows a standard curve of counts per
minute versus picomoles of hcys. this method b assay
is about fivefold more sensitive than the method a
assay and is linear from 1 to 20 pmol of hcys. it also
requires slightly less time to perform the assay and
lower amounts of serine hydroxymethyltransferase.
we routinely assay six samples at a time starting each
reaction at 30-s intervals. the reproducibility is again
very acceptable when performed with the same solutions over a several day period. however, the [ 3h]glycine solution deteriorates over a period of 1 week leading to an increased number of counts in a no hcys
control. this requires repurifying the stock labeled glycine solution (8).
assay for serum hcys content. we addressed two
questions concerning hcys levels in serum. first, does
the method give the correct amount of hcys in a biologically important fluid, and second, do methods a
and b give the same result. we started by performing
quadruplet assays on a purchased standard serum solution that was 10 ␮m in hcys. figure 2 shows that
assay method a (scheme 1b) is linear in ⌬a 340nm with
increasing amounts of serum. the range of values for
the four determinations is ⫾2.4%. in a second set of
experiments each sample of serum was spiked with 50
pmol of hcys from our stock l-hcys-s-s-hcys solution.
a parallel line was obtained and the y-intercept gives
the relationship of ⌬a 340nm to the added hcys (fig. 2).
from the y-axis intercept we calculated that the recovery of the added hcys-s-s-hcys in the serum was 100%

within experimental error. the amount of hcys, determined in the serum standard by method a, is 9.9 ⫾
0.14 ␮m.
these studies were repeated using the glycine tritium exchange assay (method b). the level of hcys
determined from multiple samples was 10.4 ⫾ 0.2 ␮m.
we conclude from these studies that both assay methods give accurate measurements of serum hcys levels.
the within and between assay reproducibilities for the
serum standard were ⫾1.4 and ⫾1.5% for method a
and ⫾1.2 and ⫾1.9% for method b, respectively.
assay for hcys in cell culture. we also determined
the levels of hcys in the human breast cancer mcf 7
cell line. we are currently studying one-carbon metabolism in this cell line using 13c-labeled substrates. we
want to relate the flux of one-carbon groups, the level of
folate intermediates, and b 6 status to hcys levels. this
includes both hcys intracellular levels and hcys exported into the medium. we used the glycine tritium
exchange assay (method b) to test for the number of
cells that would be required to obtain an accurate
measurement.
cells were grown for several days in defined medium containing all essential nutrients. the cells
were harvested and after washing they were ruptured by sonication. insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was
analyzed for hcys as described under materials and
methods. aliquots of the culture medium were also
taken at this time and analyzed for hcys. the control
was medium taken before inoculation with cells. the
amount of hcys per 1 ⫻ 10 6 cells is 482 ⫾ 20 pmol.
the medium contained 0.81 ⫾ 0.03 ␮m hcys prior to
inoculation with cells and 5.39 ⫾ 0.19 ␮m hcys after
2 days of growth. our results show good reproducibility between multiple measurements with variations of less than ⫾2% for both the cell and the
medium determinations. based on these results we
can obtain accurate hcys levels using as little as 5 ⫻
10 3 cells and 1–5 ␮l of medium.
using cells that had grown to confluency we also
tested assay method a and found very similar levels of
hcys (data not shown). even though this assay is less
sensitive it can also be used to determine hcys levels in
experiments where the number of cells is sufficient.
interference by l-cysteine. serum contains l-cysteine at concentrations as great as 30-fold higher than
total hcys (15). in our assays cysteine would interfere
if it served as a poor substrate for  xxxg1479xxx 
resulting in the conversion of 5-ch 3-h 4pteglu 4 to
h 4pteglu 4. we tested for this by including in the no
hcys controls up to 1800 pmol of l-cysteine. this level
is more than 30-fold higher than the upper level of our
hcys determinations used in method a. the results
show that there is no increase in ⌬a 340 for these reac-

tions, showing that l-cysteine is not a factor in our
assay methods.
discussion

increased levels of hcys in serum have been associated as a risk factor for a number of disease states
(1–3). current commercially available assays are sensitive, but can be time consuming and expensive when
many assays must be performed in the research laboratory (5, 6). it is also clear that understanding the
metabolic origin and levels of serum hcys will require
more defined systems involving more homogeneous cell
populations. only a relatively few studies have currently been done in defined cell culture conditions, but
studies on cells in culture are most likely to increase in
coming years. we offer two methods that are both
sensitive and rapid for hcys determination. in this
study we also show that these methods give adequate
reproducibility and that l-cysteine does not interfere.
a key factor is the availability of assay reagents in
the research laboratory. this appears to be a problem
with our assay methods since they use multiple enzymes. however, all but one of these enzymes have
been cloned and expressed in e. coli at high levels and
the clones are available to researchers. in addition, all
of the enzymes can be purified to almost homogeneous
levels in 1 or 2 days, in most cases involving only an
ammonium sulfate fractionation and one or two ionexchange column steps. in 1 week one can purify
enough of each enzyme to do several thousand assays
for hcys. the one enzyme that is not cloned into an e.
coli expression system is  xxxg131xxx . however, starting with two rabbit livers
one can obtain 70 mg of pure enzyme in a 6- to 7-h
purification procedure (13). this is enough for 700
hcys assays. each of the enzymes used in the assays is
stable at ⫺20°c in either 10 to 20% glycerol or sucrose
for many months. also, these enzymes are commercially available in their purified form.
synthesis of the polyglutamate form of 5-ch 3h 4pteglu n is also a potential problem. the polyglutamate form must be used because the cobalamin independent  xxxg1479xxx  (expressed from the
mete gene) requires at least the triglutamate form as a
substrate (10). e. coli also contains the meth gene
which codes for a cobalamin-dependent methionine
synthase, which does use the monoglutamate form of
5-ch 3-h 4pteglu as a substrate (16). we have tested
this enzyme, which is also available as an over expressing clone in e. coli, but found that in method a it
reduced the sensitivity for hcys by 1 order of magnitude. however, it does work well for the tritium exchange assay used in method b. the  xxxg1479xxx  is more difficult to purify
and is not overproduced in e. coli cells at a high level

homocysteine assay

compared to the cobalamin-independent methionine
synthase, so we have used only the latter. this requires
the use then of 5-ch 3-h 4pteglu 3 or higher polyglutamate forms. as reported here, we synthesized the tetraglutamate from the commercially available monoglutamate by an enzymatic method. however, there are
other readily available methods for preparing this substrate. first, both (6s)5-formyl-h 4pteglu 3 and  xxxd2146xxx  3 can be purchased from schirks laboratory in
jona, switzerland. the 5-formyl derivative can be converted to 5-ch 3-h 4pteglu 3 by a combination of enzymatic reactions and nabh 4 reduction, as described
previously (17). the enzymes used in this method are
the same as those used in the method a assay for hcys.
second,  xxxd2146xxx  3 can be reduced directly to 5-ch 3h 4pteglu 3 using formaldehyde and nabh 4 (18). one
obtains in this procedure the racemic (6r,s)5-ch 3h 4pteglu 3, which can be substituted for the (6s) derivative in both hcys assays described. because so
little 5-ch 3-h 4pteglu 3 is used in each assay and the
5-ch 3-h 4pteglu 3 is stable to storage one can generate
enough of this compound to perform several thousand
assays in only a few days.
we have previously published two methods for analyzing the levels of reduced folates in tissue extracts.
one of these methods determines the combined levels
of h 4pteglu n , 5,10-methylene-h 4pteglu n , 5-formylh 4pteglu n , and 10-formyl-h 4pteglu n and separately
5-ch 3-h 4pteglu n (17). thus, one can determine the
total pool of reduced folates. this method uses the
same enzymes utilized by the method a assay for hcys
discussed in this study. we have also published a
method for determining each of the individual pools of
reduced folates (19). this reduced folate determination
method is based on a variation of method b used here
for hcys determination. thus, by using the enzymes
for the hcys assay one can also perform reduced folate
analysis.
