abstract: cystic fibrosis (cf) is a genetic disorder that causes multiorgan morbidity
and premature death, most commonly from pulmonary dysfunction. mutations in the cf
transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) gene, of which almost 2000 have been
described, result in a dysfunctional cftr protein. this protein is an  xxxd83xxx 
binding anion channel, present primarily at the surface of epithelial cells. loss of function
mutations in this anion channel result in decreased or absent chloride/bicarbonate
transport. the subsequent abnormal salt and water transport at epithelial cell surfaces
leads to thickened secretions, and infection or inflammation in affected organs. in the
last 20 years, therapeutics have been developed to treat the signs and symptoms of cf.
however, in 2012, the small molecule drug,  xxxd2408xxx , became the first approved therapy
that addresses the basic defect in cf.  xxxd2408xxx  is a potentiator of cftr channels defective
in their chloride/bicarbonate gating/conductance, but present at the epithelial cell surface.
it is only approved for 10 mutations carried by approximately 7% of the population of
patients with cf. f508del is the most common cftr mutation, present in homozygosity
in approximately 50% of patients with cf. the f508del mutation results in multiple cftr
channel defects that require both correction (stabilization of misfolded cftr and trafficking
to the epithelial cell membrane) and potentiation. this article reviews the in vitro and clinical
trial data for the potential use of the potentiator,  xxxd2408xxx , and the corrector,  xxxd2516xxx , in
patients with cf.

background
cystic fibrosis
cystic fibrosis (cf) is an autosomal recessive
genetic disorder that causes decreased survival
with an average age of death of approximately 28
years [cff, 2013]. cf is caused by mutations in
the  xxxg437xxx 
(cftr) gene which encodes the cftr protein,
an  xxxd83xxx  binding chloride anion
channel that functions at the epithelial cell membrane [ikuma and welsh, 2000]. at this point,
nearly 2000 cftr mutations have been described
[toronto, 2015]. to varying degrees, these mutations lead to decreased salt and water transport in
mucous membrane lined organs as a result of

malfunctioning or absent cftr channels [rowe
et al. 2005]. in the sinuses and lungs, this
decreased salt and water transport results in
thickened mucus that impairs the body’s ability to
clear secretions [gibson et al. 2003]. a cycle of
chronic infection and inflammation leads to tissue
destruction [gibson et al. 2003]. in the gastrointestinal tract, this abnormal mucosal surface fluid
regulation leads to exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, malabsorption and intestinal obstruction
[borowitz and gelfond, 2013].

adapted from cff [2015].

et al. 1989], the promise of a cure with gene therapy seemed imminent. however, available gene
transport vectors proved inefficient, and clinical
trials were not successful [griesenbach and alton,
2013]. subsequently, cf-specific therapeutics that
treat the signs and symptoms of cf lung disease
were developed, including dornase alfa [fuchs
et al. 1994] (to decrease the viscosity of sputum),
and inhaled tobramycin [ramsey et al. 1999] and
inhaled  xxxd276xxx  [oermann et al. 2010] (antipseudomonal antibiotics). additional therapies
that were tested in clinical trials that treat infection
and inflammation [konstan et al. 1995; saiman
et al. 2003, 2010], and improve mucus clearance
[donaldson et al. 2006; elkins et al. 2006] have
been incorporated into the daily management of
this chronic disease. in combination with nutritional support, and comprehensive, coordinated
care in accredited cf centers, these therapies
improved the survival of patients with cf [konstan
et al. 2010; cff, 2015]. however, it was not until
recently that cftr modulators (figure 1), drugs
that directly address the basic defect in cf, were
tested and proven in clinical trials.
 xxxd2408xxx , a small molecule discovered through
high throughput screening, is a cftr potentiator

(figure 1): it increases the open probability of
cftr channels present at the epithelial cell surface that are defective in their gating, such as the
g551d mutation [van goor et al. 2009].  xxxd2408xxx 
was tested in a phase ii multidose, multicenter
placebo-controlled randomized trial in 39 adults
with cf [accurso et al. 2010].  xxxd2408xxx  was
shown to improve chloride transport both by nasal
potential difference measurement (npd) and
sweat chloride concentration, with a median
decrease in the level of sweat chloride of −59.5
mmol/liter (range −66.0 to −19.0; p = 0.008
within subject, p = 0.02 versus placebo) at 28 days.
a median increase in forced expiratory volume in
1 s (fev1) of 8.7% (range 2.3–31.3; p = 0.008 for
the within-subject comparison, p = 0.56 versus
placebo) at day 28 was also achieved in the  xxxd2408xxx -treated subjects (table 1). for the first time
since cf was described [andersen, 1938], these
data provided proof of concept that treatment of
the molecular defect was possible.
two large phase iii studies were conducted in subjects with cf and at least one copy of the g551d
mutation: one in subjects at least 12 years of age
with fev1 % predicted of at least 40% and up to
90% (strive) [ramsey et al. 2011], and one in

strive and envison were sustained over
96 weeks. based on the data from the phase iii
studies,  xxxd2408xxx  was approved in 2012 for patients
with the g551d mutation. this approval marked
 xxxd2408xxx  as the first drug in the history of cf therapeutics to be approved for treatment of the molecular defect in cf. utilizing data from expanded
access programs,  xxxd2408xxx  was subsequently shown
to be beneficial and well tolerated, even in those
with advanced disease [hebestreit et al. 2013; barry
et al. 2014;taylor-cousar et al. 2015]. furthermore,
goal investigators prospectively collected data on
patients who were eligible to receive  xxxd2408xxx  following us food and drug administration (fda)
approval. in their longitudinal cohort study, the
goal investigators showed that significant
improvements in lung function, weight, and hospitalizations were achievable in patients with the
g551d mutation who take  xxxd2408xxx  even outside
of the research setting [rowe et al. 2014].
the g551d mutation is the most common gating
defect (occurring in approximately 4% of the cf
population), but there are other, more rare mutations (occurring at a combined rate of approximately 1%) that are also categorized in this class
[boyle and de boeck, 2013]. in vitro data suggested that  xxxd2408xxx  could also be efficacious for
patients with other gating mutations [yu et al.
2012].  xxxd2408xxx  was tested in an international
multicenter
two-part
clinical
trial
(konnection) for patients with one of eight
other gating defects (g178r, s549n, s549r,
g551s, g1244e, s1251n, s1255p or g1349d)
[de boeck et al. 2014]. subjects were initially randomized in a blinded fashion to one of two
sequences (beginning with  xxxd2408xxx  or placebo)
for 8 weeks, followed by a 4–8-week washout
period prior to crossing over to the opposite
sequence. all subjects were then given open-label
 xxxd2408xxx  in a 16-week extension period. subjects
experienced a 7.5% improvement in absolute
change in fev1 % predicted (p < 0.0001) at 8
weeks, as well as in sweat chloride, body mass
index (bmi), and quality of life. these results were
sustained over the course of the extension period.
finally, based on in vitro work suggesting potential
response of the conductance defect causing (‘residual function’), mutation r117h [van goor et al.
2012], an additional phase iii randomized, double-blinded 24-week clinical trial [clinicaltrials.
gov identifier: nct01614457] using  xxxd2408xxx  was
conducted in children and adults with at least one
copy of the r117h mutation. sixty-nine patients
were randomized. although the study did not meet

its primary endpoint (absolute change from baseline in fev1 % predicted) in the group as a whole,
prespecified subgroup analysis in those subjects at
least 18 years of age (n = 46) showed an absolute
mean improvement in fev1 % predicted of 5.0
(p = 0.01). statistically significant improvements
were seen in secondary endpoints, including sweat
chloride and patient-reported respiratory symptoms. based on these results,  xxxd2408xxx  was
approved for use in december 2014 in patients
with cf who are at least 6 years of age with the
r117h mutation.
 xxxd2408xxx  is clearly efficacious in patients with cf
who have gating mutations or the conducting
mutation r117h; however, this indication affects
only 6.8% of the us cf population [cff, 2013].
approximately 90% of patients with cf are heterozygous for the f508del mutation and nearly
50% are homozygous for this mutation [cff,
2013]. compared with patients who were
homozygous for the f508del mutation, those who
were heterozygous for the mutation and those
without the f508del mutation had lower adjusted
risk for death [14%, 95% confidence interval (ci)
7–20%; and 25%, 95% ci 15–34%, respectively]
[mackenzie et al. 2014]. unlike gating or conductance mutations, the f508del mutation causes
protein misfolding that results in degradation in
the endoplasmic reticulum [thomas et al. 1992].
thus, only a small amount of cftr protein is
trafficked to the cell surface [denning et al. 1992].
additionally, once at the cell surface, the small
amount of f508del cftr that is present demonstrates defective gating and increased turnover.
in vitro work in f508del homozygous human
bronchial epithelial human epithelial cells (hbec)
showed that  xxxd2408xxx  improved cftr-mediated
chloride secretion to approximately 10% of
non-cf hbec (compared with an increase in
f508del/g551d hbec from 5% to approximately 50% of that observed in non-cf hbec)
[van goor et al. 2009]. at that time it was unclear
how closely in vitro response would correlate with
clinical response. thus,  xxxd2408xxx  monotherapy
was attempted in a 16-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
(discover) of 140 patients homozygous for the
f508del mutation [flume et al. 2012]. as
expected, based on the multiple defects that must
be corrected to render the f508del protein functional (folding, processing, conductance), the randomized controlled trial of  xxxd2408xxx  monotherapy
did not show improvements in lung function or

other clinical endpoints (although there was a
clinically insignificant but statistically significant
improvement of −2.9 mmol/liter in sweat chloride;
95% ci −5.6 to −0.2, p = 0.0384). based on these
results, use of  xxxd2408xxx  monotherapy in patients
with cf who are homozygous for the f508del
mutation is specifically excluded in the  xxxd2408xxx 
package insert [vertex pharmaceuticals, 2015].
solely using the cftr potentiator,  xxxd2408xxx , was
insufficient to treat patients homozygous for the
f508del mutation. however, data in hbec looked
promising using a cftr corrector [van goor
et al. 2011], a drug that improves processing and
trafficking of defective cftr to the epithelial cell
surface (figure 1). following high throughput
screening of 164,000 small molecules for their
ability to improve the amount of functional
f508del cftr at the cell surface, van goor and
colleagues tested the most efficacious compound,
 xxxd2516xxx , in cultured hbec from patients with cf
homozygous for the f508del mutation [van goor
et al. 2011]. they demonstrated that  xxxd2516xxx 
( xxxd2516xxx ) increased processing of f508del cftr
such that an increased amount of f508del cftr
was able to leave the endoplasmic reticulum (er)
and be trafficked to the cell surface; chloride secretion was improved to approximately 14% of that of
non-cf hbec. subsequently, these investigators
treated the hbec with both  xxxd2516xxx  and  xxxd2408xxx . the combination increased f508del cftr
chloride secretion to approximately 25% of that of
non-cf hbec. these results suggested that using
the corrector to improve processing and trafficking
of f508del cftr to the cell surface, in combination with the potentiator to increase the conductance of f508del cftr at the cell surface, would
potentially lead to a therapy that could affect at
least 50% of the cf population.
pharmacokinetics
while the combination of  xxxd2516xxx  and  xxxd2408xxx  in vitro leads to increased f508del cftr
chloride secretion acutely, subsequent in vitro
studies showed that prolonged (24–48 h) administration of the two drugs resulted in a drug interaction that reduced the efficacy of  xxxd2516xxx .
specifically, in hbec homozygous for the
f508del cftr mutation, coadministration of
 xxxd2408xxx  with  xxxd2516xxx  led to decreased folding
efficiency and stability of f508del cftr, resulting in an increased turnover rate and reduction in
mature cftr at the cell surface [veit et al. 2014;
cholon et al. 2014].

cohort 1 in the phase ii trial was designed to
assess the potential pharmacokinetic (pk) interactions between the two drugs in order to aid with
dosing parameters, and cohorts 2–3 were conducted to determine whether higher doses and
longer duration of treatment might provide clinical benefit that would support phase iii trials in
spite of the drug–drug interaction [boyle et al.
2014]. pk findings from the study were submitted to the fda and were reported by the fda
clinical pharmacology reviewer during the
pulmonary-allergy drugs advisory committee
(padac) meeting [fda, 2015]. results from
the comprehensive clinical pharmacology program included the pk and metabolism of the
individual drug components  xxxd2516xxx  and  xxxd2408xxx  as well as the combination products.
steady-state plasma concentrations of the combination of  xxxd2516xxx  and  xxxd2408xxx  following twice
daily dosing were typically reached after approximately 7 days of treatment [fda, 2015]. the
 xxxd2516xxx  accumulation ratio was approximately
1.9, whereas that of  xxxd2408xxx  was lower at day 1
due to the cytochrome p450 3a ( xxxg590xxx ) induction effect of  xxxd2516xxx . drug absorption of the
combination product was also affected by the
intake of fatty foods with  xxxd2516xxx  exposure
being approximately two times higher and  xxxd2408xxx  exposure being three times higher when
compared with a fasting state.
both  xxxd2516xxx  and  xxxd2408xxx  are 99% bound to
plasma proteins.  xxxd2516xxx  is not extensively
metabolized so that most of the drug is excreted
unchanged in the feces. it is a strong inducer of
 xxxg590xxx  enzymes and has a terminal half life of
approximately 26 h. in contrast to  xxxd2516xxx ,
 xxxd2408xxx  is primarily metabolized by  xxxg590xxx 
enzymes and excreted in the feces with a terminal
half life of approximately 12 h. considering that
 xxxd2516xxx  is a strong inducer of  xxxg590xxx , and  xxxd2408xxx  is a  xxxg590xxx  substrate, when dosed together
 xxxd2408xxx  exposure is reduced by  xxxd2516xxx  in a
dose-dependent manner.  xxxd2516xxx  exposure is
not affected by  xxxd2408xxx . findings of this clinically relevant drug–drug interaction were noted
in the phase ii pk analysis that found when
 xxxd2516xxx  400 mg every 12 h was administered
with  xxxd2408xxx  150 mg twice daily, exposure is
reduced by more than 80% [clancy et al. 2012;
fda, 2015].
in vitro studies have also suggested that  xxxd2516xxx 
has the potential to induce  xxxg583xxx ,  xxxg586xxx ,

cyp2c9, and cyp2c19 as well as inhibit

the induction/substrate effects of the combination
of  xxxd2516xxx  and  xxxd2408xxx , the metabolism of
other drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes
may be altered. therefore, many medications utilized in the management of patients with cf such
as oral and intravenous antibiotics, antifungals,
 xxxg215xxx  inhibitors, and antidepressants will
require dose adjustment if used when a patient is
on combination therapy [fda, 2015].
current evidence
phase iia trial
based on the promising in vitro evidence of
improvement of the function of f508del cftr
following combination treatment of f508del
hbec, investigators designed a phase iia multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in
adult patients with cf who were homozygous for
the f508del mutation to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pk of  xxxd2516xxx  ( xxxd2516xxx ) [clancy
et al. 2012]. secondary outcome measures aimed
at evaluation of the effect of  xxxd2516xxx  on cftr
function included sweat chloride and npd. lung
function and quality of life were also measured as
secondary outcomes. subjects were enrolled into
two cohorts. in cohort a, 15 subjects were

randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive  xxxd2516xxx 
at 25 mg or 50 mg, or placebo for 28 days.
following safety review of data from the first 15
subjects by an independent data monitoring committee, 74 subjects were randomized in a 2:2:1
ratio to receive  xxxd2516xxx  at a dose of 100 mg or
200 mg, or placebo for 28 days.
treatment with  xxxd2516xxx  led to a dose-dependent decrease in sweat chloride values (p = 0.0013)
that occurred within 7 days of drug dosing, and
was sustained over the course of the trial. the
mean change from baseline in sweat chloride in
the highest dose (200 mg) group was −6.6 mmol/
liter (95% ci −10.27 to −2.83, p = 0.0008)  xxxd2274xxx 
days, and −8.21 mmol/liter (95% ci −14.33 to
−2.10) at 28 days. this difference was statistically
different versus placebo (p < 0.01). sweat chloride levels returned approximately to baseline levels following a 7-day drug washout period.
although improvements were seen in sweat chloride levels, there were no differences in cftrdependent npd measurement in any of the dose
groups. in addition, there were no changes in relative amounts of mature versus immature forms of
f508del cftr in the subgroup of patients (n =
34) who underwent rectal biopsy. finally, there
were no differences in lung function or quality of
life in any of the dose groups, although the study
was not powered to detect such differences.

generally, treatment with  xxxd2516xxx  ( xxxd2516xxx )
was safe and well tolerated. the most commonly
reported adverse events in  xxxd2516xxx - and placebo-treated subjects were cough, headache, and
dyspnea. cough and dyspnea occurred in placeboversus  xxxd2516xxx -treated subjects at rates of 41%
and 5.9%, and 46% and 19%, respectively. no subjects in the placebo group withdrew from the study,
although one subject in each of the  xxxd2516xxx  dose
groups withdrew from the study.the rate of adverse
respiratory events was similar between the different
dose groups. finally, there was no statistically significant difference between rate of exacerbations
between the placebo-treated and lumacaftortreated subjects (12% versus 17%, p = 0.62).
data from this phase iia trial showed that modulation of cftr function in patients homozygous for
the f508del cftr mutation was safe and possible, but insufficient to improve lung function over
28 days. the question remained whether administration of a combination of the corrector and the
potentiator could further improve cftr function
sufficiently to improve clinical outcomes.
phase ii trial
based on the results of the phase iia trial, researchers designed a multicenter, multidose, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of  xxxd2408xxx  plus
 xxxd2516xxx  ( xxxd2516xxx ) in adults with cf homozygous and heterozygous for the f508del mutation
[boyle et al. 2014]. three successive cohorts were
planned, with dosing for each subsequent cohort
defined by data from the previous cohort (figure 3).
the primary outcomes for the study were change
in sweat chloride concentration during combination therapy, and safety. secondary outcomes
included change in lung function and change in
sweat chloride from baseline in all cohorts. change
in cystic fibrosis questionnaire-revised (cfqr) scores was included as a secondary endpoint in
cohorts 2 and 3.
in cohort 1 (n = 62 subjects randomized) subjects’ fev1 did not change significantly compared
with placebo in either of the  xxxd2516xxx  plus  xxxd2408xxx  dose groups. however, during the combination therapy treatment period, cohort 1 subjects
who received 200 mg  xxxd2516xxx  daily and
250 mg  xxxd2516xxx  twice daily experienced a
decrease in sweat chloride of −9.1 mmol/liter
(95% ci −12.9 to 5.4, p < 0.001) that was significantly different from that in the placebo group
(−9.7 mmol/liter, 95% ci −14.8 to −4.6,

p < 0.001). based on these data, subjects in
cohorts 2 and 3 randomized to the study drug
were given a combination of  xxxd2516xxx  and  xxxd2408xxx  250 mg every 12 h.
subjects in cohort 2 (n = 109 randomized) who
were homozygous for the f508del cftr mutation (n = 82) and received either 600 mg daily or
400 mg twice daily of  xxxd2516xxx  plus 250 mg  xxxd2408xxx  every 12 h experienced a mean increase in
absolute fev1 % predicted (6.2, 95% ci 3.3–9.0,
p < 0.001; and 6.1, 95% ci 2.0–10.2, p = 0.0040,
respectively) during combination treatment (but
not during monotherapy). these changes in fev1
were significantly improved compared with placebo in these treatment groups (p < 0.001 and
p =0.003, respectively). mean sweat chloride concentrations did not decrease significantly in any of
the groups during the combination therapy
period, although there were significant decreases
over the entire study period (days 1–56) in the
patients homozygous for the f508del cftr
mutation in the daily  xxxd2516xxx  plus  xxxd2408xxx 
groups (−9.1 mmol/liter, 95% ci −13.3 to −4.9,
p < 0.001; and −8.9 mmol/liter, 95% ci −13.1 to
−4.7, p < 0.001, respectively). over the total
treatment period, improvement in the respiratory
portion of the cfq-r was observed compared
with the placebo group in the subjects who
received  xxxd2516xxx  400 mg daily (13.5, 95% ci
3.2–23.9, p = 0.011), but not in those who
received 600 mg daily. there were no statistically
significant differences in sweat chloride or in lung
function during combination therapy for subjects
heterozygous for the f508del cftr mutation.
for subjects in cohort 3 (n = 15 patients randomized) homozygous for the f508del cftr
mutation randomized to who received twice daily
 xxxd2516xxx  plus twice daily  xxxd2408xxx  group, mean
sweat chloride concentrations did not decrease
significantly during the combination therapy
period, although there was a significant decrease
in sweat chloride levels over the entire study
period (days 1–56) (–10.3, 16.7–4.0, p = 0.002).
there was an improvement in lung function during the combination period for subjects in this
cohort: a mean absolute increase in fev1 % predicted of 6.1 (95% ci 2.0–10.2, p = 0.004), and
a mean relative increase (compared with placebo)
of 7.7 (95% ci 2.7–12.6, p = 0.003). there was
not a statistically significant improvement in
cfq-r respiratory scores for subjects in this
cohort over the 56-day study period compared
with placebo.

exacerbation, and headache. the new onset of
chest tightness and dyspnea were not more common than in placebo in subjects on combination
therapy and no subjects discontinued treatment
because of an adverse event during combination
therapy. the rate of serious adverse events, including pulmonary exacerbation, was similar between
the combination therapy and placebo groups.
there were no serious adverse events corresponding to liver function test abnormalities that were
caused by study drug treatment.
the phase ii trial revealed a number of important
points for consideration in design of the phase iii
trials. critically, although the improvements in
cftr function and lung function were modest
compared with those observed in the studies of
 xxxd2408xxx  in patients with gating and conductance
mutations, the phase ii trial showed that modulation of f508del cftr is possible. second, this
study provided information about dosing, specifically that the 600 mg daily or 400 mg twice daily
doses of  xxxd2516xxx  were most likely to be efficacious. additionally, in spite of the drug–drug
interaction between  xxxd2516xxx  and  xxxd2408xxx 
[cholon et al. 2014; veit et al. 2014], clinical
improvements were observed during combination
therapy [boyle et al. 2014]. although increased
respiratory adverse events were observed with
higher doses of  xxxd2516xxx  in some subjects during monotherapy, combination therapy was overall safe and well tolerated. finally, although the
trends for patients heterozygous for the f508del
mutation were similar to those homozygous for
the mutation, the data demonstrated that this
combination of modulator therapies was not sufficiently efficacious in heterozygotes to move forward with testing in this group.
phase iii trial
using the results of the phase ii trial to guide
them, investigators designed two phase iii clinical
trials of  xxxd2516xxx – xxxd2408xxx  combination therapy in patients at least 12 years of age who were
homozygous for the f508del mutation
[wainwright et al. 2015]. the two studies,
traffic and transport, were run in parallel. subjects from 187 multinational sites were
randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to one of the two
most promising doses of  xxxd2516xxx , 600 mg once
daily or 400 mg every 12 h, in combination with
 xxxd2408xxx  250 mg every 12 h, or placebo for
24 weeks. randomization was stratified by age,
sex, and pulmonary function at screening. the

primary endpoint for both studies was the absolute change from baseline in the fev1 % predicted at 24 weeks. secondary endpoints for both
studies included the relative change from baseline
in the fev1 % predicted, absolute change from
baseline at week 24 in bmi and cfq-r respiratory domain, percentage of patients with a relative
increase of at least 5% in fev1 % predicted, and
number of pulmonary exacerbations over the
24 weeks of the study.
of the 1122 patients who were randomized, 1108
received at least one dose of study drug. the
mean age of the subjects across the dosing groups
was approximately 25 years of age. approximately
half of the subjects were women, and their baseline fev1 % predicted was around 61%.
consistent with this degree of lung dysfunction,
the majority of patients were concomitantly
treated with bronchodilators, dornase alfa,
inhaled antibiotics, azithromycin inhaled hypertonic saline, and inhaled glucocorticoids.
in this heavily treated patient population, combination therapy led to modest improvements in the
primary and secondary endpoints of the study.
compared with placebo, the mean absolute
change in fev1 % predicted from baseline to
week 24 was significantly improved in all dose
groups in the individual studies (traffic: 2.6–
4%, transport: 2.6–3%, p < 0.001), and in
the pooled data (2.8–3.3%, p < 0.001). the relative change in fev1 % predicted from baseline to
24 weeks was also significantly improved in all
dose groups in both studies (traffic: 4.3–
6.7%, transport: 4.5–5.3%, p < 0.001) and
in the pooled data (4.8–5.6%, p < 0.001). these
changes in fev1 occurred within 15 days of the
start of the study drug and were sustained through
the 24 weeks of the trial. furthermore, the
improvement in fev1 % predicted was consistent
across all subgroups tested, including age (children versus adults ⩾ 18 years), severity of lung
disease (mild, moderate, or severe), and sex and
pseudomonas aeruginosa infection status. finally,
based on the pooled data, the odds ratio for a relative increase of at least 5% from baseline in fev1
% predicted was 2.2 (95% ci 1.6–3.1, p < 0.001)
for the subjects receiving 400 mg twice daily plus
 xxxd2408xxx , and 3.1 (95% ci 0.8–5.3, p < 0.001)
compared with placebo.
in addition to modest improvements in lung
function, there were also improvements in important secondary endpoints. most remarkably,

therapeutic advances in respiratory disease ﻿
compared with placebo, there was a 30% lower
rate of protocol-defined pulmonary exacerbations in the 600 mg  xxxd2516xxx  group (p = 0.001)
and a 39% lower exacerbation rate in the 400 mg
twice daily  xxxd2516xxx – xxxd2408xxx  group (p < 0.001).
notably, compared with placebo, there was a
higher proportion of subjects who were exacerbation free at the end of the 24-week trial in the
pooled  xxxd2516xxx – xxxd2408xxx  dosing groups.
pulmonary exacerbations leading to intravenous
antibiotics or hospitalization were also reduced in
the  xxxd2516xxx – xxxd2408xxx  treated groups compared with placebo [ xxxd2516xxx  600 mg daily
plus  xxxd2408xxx : 45% reduction in events leading to
intravenous antibiotic therapy (p < 0.001) and
39% reduction in events leading to hospitalization (p = 0.003);  xxxd2516xxx  400 mg every 12 h
plus  xxxd2408xxx : 56% reduction in events leading to
intravenous antibiotic therapy (p < 0.001) and
61% reduction in events leading to intravenous
antibiotic therapy (p < 0.001)]. also based on
pooled data from the two studies, there were statistically significant improvements in absolute
change from baseline in bmi in both dosing
groups (0.24–0.28, p < 0.001). finally, although
there was a statistically significant 2.2–3.1-point
improvement in the respiratory portion of the
cfq-r (p = 0.05 and 0.007 for the  xxxd2516xxx 
400 mg  xxxd2408xxx  group and 600 mg  xxxd2408xxx 
group, respectively), this improvement does not
meet the previously defined minimally important
clinical difference for this outcome [quittner
et al. 2009].
safety and tolerability results were consistent
with those seen in the phase ii studies. in general, similar rates of adverse events (most commonly pulmonary exacerbations, cough, and
headache) were observed in the placebo and
 xxxd2516xxx – xxxd2408xxx  groups. however, dyspnea
and chest tightness were more often seen in
those treated with  xxxd2516xxx – xxxd2408xxx  (13.0–
14.9% and 8.7–10.8%, respectively) than in
placebo-treated subjects (7.8% and 5.9%,
respectively). furthermore, the proportion of
subjects who discontinued treatment was higher
in those receiving  xxxd2516xxx – xxxd2408xxx . it is
noteworthy that for those subjects that chose to
continue in the study in spite of the early emergence of respiratory-related adverse events, the
respiratory symptoms generally resolved within
2–3 weeks of continued treatment. the most
common serious adverse event in all treatment
groups was pulmonary exacerbation, which
occurred more frequently in the placebo group

(24.1% of the patients versus 13.0% in the
pooled  xxxd2516xxx – xxxd2408xxx  group). rates of
clinically significant elevations of liver function
tests were similar in the placebo and  xxxd2516xxx –
 xxxd2408xxx  treated subjects (5.1% versus 5.2%).
however, while there were no liver-related serious adverse events in the placebo group, seven
events occurred in the subjects receiving combination therapy. liver function returned to baseline in six of seven patients following
discontinuation or interruption of  xxxd2516xxx –
 xxxd2408xxx  therapy.
in summary, based on the data from two phase
iii studies,  xxxd2516xxx – xxxd2408xxx  combination
therapy was safe and relatively well tolerated
with the exception of a small percentage of
patients who experienced increased dyspnea
and chest tightness. combination therapy modestly improved lung function and led to clinically important decreased rates of pulmonary
exacerbations in subjects homozygous for the
f508del mutation. outcome data were similar
for the two  xxxd2516xxx – xxxd2408xxx  dosing groups
with the exception that the effect on exacerbations was stronger for the  xxxd2516xxx  400 mg
plus  xxxd2408xxx  group. based on these data, in
november 2014, vertex pharmaceuticals submitted a new drug application (nda) for
approval of the combination of  xxxd2516xxx – xxxd2408xxx  ( xxxd2516xxx  400 mg and  xxxd2408xxx  250 mg
every 12 h) in patients with cf who are at least
12 years of age and are homozygous for the
f508del mutation.
future directions
on 12 may 2015, the padac to the fda held a
meeting to review safety, efficacy, and the potentially appropriate use of  xxxd2516xxx – xxxd2408xxx  therapy. physicians with expertise in cf and patients
who had participated in the clinical trials spoke at
the hearing. the padac voted 12–1 to approve
the  xxxd2516xxx – xxxd2408xxx  combination (proposed
trade name, orkambi) for use in people with cf
who are at least 12 years of age and are homozygous for the f508del mutation. under the
prescription drug user fee act, the fda approved
the orkambi (vertex pharmaceuticals boston,
ma) nda 206038 on 2 july [fda, 2015].
although only very limited data from trials of  xxxd2408xxx  in patients with fev1 less than 40% were
available at the time of its fda review,  xxxd2408xxx 
was approved for patients with the g551d

mutation without a lung function restriction
[vertex pharmaceuticals, 2015]. as in the case
with  xxxd2408xxx , and most studies of new therapeutic agents in patients with cf, patients with severe
disease were excluded from the phase iii studies
of  xxxd2516xxx – xxxd2408xxx  [wainwright et al. 2015].
because treatment options for this group of
patients are limited, patients with severe cf who
are homozygous for the f508del mutation will be
very interested in trying this new therapy.
particularly in light of the increased incidence of
chest tightness in patients in the treated versus
placebo group [wainwright et al. 2015], safety
and tolerance data in the group of patients with
severe cf lung disease are crucial. a 6-month
open-label study of  xxxd2516xxx – xxxd2408xxx  therapy
in subjects homozygous for the f508del mutation
who are over 12 years with fev1 less than 40% or
actively listed for lung transplant is currently
enrolling
[clinicaltrials.gov
identifier:
nct02390219].
lack of validated surrogate endpoints in children
under the age of 6 years makes it difficult to prove
efficacy in this group. however, safety was shown
in a clinical trial of  xxxd2408xxx  in children aged 2–5
years old with gating mutations [clinicaltrials.
gov identifier: nct01705145]. this trial led to
approval of  xxxd2408xxx  for patients at least 2 years
old with cf with gating mutations [vertex
pharmaceuticals, 2015]. because it is clear that
lung disease is present from a very young age
[stick et al. 2009], it will be important to conduct
safety and efficacy studies in 6–11-year-old
patients and safety studies in patients under the
age of 5 years.
with its approval,  xxxd2516xxx – xxxd2408xxx  combination therapy is the first modulator therapy approved
that will potentially treat almost half of the patients
with cf. though the effects on important clinical
endpoints including lung function and bmi were
small [wainwright et al. 2015], it is a first step. given
the complex pathophysiology of f508del cftr
mutation dysfunction, two or more small molecules
may be required to adequately correct and potentiate the resultant malfunctioning protein.
investigation of other novel small molecule modulator therapies is underway. for example, the
oral potentiator, qbw251, is being evaluated in a
phase ii trial in adult patients with cf who are
heterozygous for mutations resulting in dysfunctional cftr channels present at the cell surface
[clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct02190604].

additionally, a phase ib trial has recently been
completed
using
n91115,
an
oral
 xxxg76xxx  inhibitor shown in
vitro to stabilize f508del cftr [clinicaltrials.
gov identifier: nct02275936]. finally, vx-661,
an oral cftr corrector, is being studied in combination with  xxxd2408xxx  in phase iii subjects
homozygous
[clinicaltrials.gov
identifier:
nct02347657] and heterozygous for the
f508del mutation [clinicaltrials.gov identifier:
nct02392234, nct02412111].
in addition to evaluation of novel small molecules
for cftr correction, drugs approved for other
disease states with potential cftr activity are
being studied. early phase clinical trials of  xxxd3127xxx  (approved for treatment of pulmonary
hypertension) and  xxxd2645xxx  (approved for type i
gaucher’s and niemann–pick disease) are
actively recruiting patients with cf homozygous
for the f508del cftr mutation[clinicaltrials.
gov identifier: nct02170025, nct02325362].
while the majority of patients may be treated with
modulators that effect mutations defective in their
folding, gating and conductance, approximately
10% [peltz et al. 2013] of patients have mutations
(‘nonsense mutations’) that result in prematurely
truncated cftr protein. a clinical trial of a therapeutic agent that promotes read-through of premature truncation codons is also enrolling
[clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct02139306].
for the remaining 2% of mutations that are
unlikely to respond to modulator therapy with
small molecules, dna or rna editing through
oligonucleotide therapy may be an option in the
future [mcneer et al. 2015].
prior to the approval of  xxxd2408xxx  for patients with
the g551d mutation, mackenzie and colleagues
projected that if mortality in cf continued to
decrease at the rate observed between 2000 and
2010, predicted median survival for a child born
in 2010 would be over 50 years [mackenzie et al.
2014]. this predicted age is still well below the
current survival of the non-cf us population.
however, based on the effect of cftr modulators on fev1 (our best predictor of mortality in
cf) [kerem et al. 1992], we may rapidly close
this survival gap.
