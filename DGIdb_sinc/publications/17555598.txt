abstract
background:  xxxd105xxx  (anti- xxxg377xxx ) biological therapy selectively targets effector memory t cells
(tem) in psoriasis vulgaris, a model type 1 autoimmune disease.
methods: circulating leukocytes were phenotyped in patients receiving  xxxd105xxx  for moderate to
severe psoriasis.
results: in all patients, this treatment caused a preferential decrease in effector memory t cells
(ccr7- cd45ra-) (mean 63% reduction) for both cd4+ and cd8+ tem, while central memory t
cells (tcm) (ccr7+cd45ra-) were less affected, and naïve t cells (ccr7+cd45ra+) were
relatively spared. circulating cd8+ effector t cells and type 1 t cells ( xxxg1141xxx -producing) were also
significantly reduced.
conclusion:  xxxd105xxx  causes a selective reduction in circulating effector memory t cells (tem)
and relative preservation of central memory t cells (tcm) in psoriasis.

background
a major pathogenic hypothesis for psoriasis vulgaris is
that it is an inflammatory autoimmune disease initiated
and sustained in skin regions through the actions of memory cd4+ and cd8+ t lymphocytes that serve as type 1
effectors [1,2]. a significant expansion of type 1 t cells in
the peripheral circulation of psoriasis patients has been
measured [3]. a number of biological therapies have been

recently approved for use in psoriasis, such as  xxxd105xxx 
(lymphocyte function-associated antigen [lfa]-3 t cell
inhibitory protein [tip]; anti- xxxg377xxx ; amevive; biogen
idec), which is effective in approximately 30% of psoriasis
patients (75% clinical response from baseline) [4].
understanding the effects and actions of such an agent is
useful to evaluate the relative contribution of different cell
types to the pathogenesis of psoriasis.

 xxxg377xxx  is a costimulatory molecule found predominantly
on lymphocytes and natural killer (nk) cells [5], but also
on a small subset of dendritic cells (dcs) [6,7].  xxxg377xxx  binding regulates the threshold of antigen to which t cells will
react, increasing the affinity of the immune synapse, and
it is important for effector actions of differentiated cd8+
cytotoxic t lymphocytes [5,8].  xxxg377xxx  ligation can deliver a
stimulatory or inhibitory signal, or be involved in lymphocyte adhesion, depending on the system studied [912].
 xxxd105xxx  is a fusion protein combining the first extracellular domain of  xxxg395xxx  ( xxxg395xxx ) with constant regions (ch2
and ch3) and the hinge domain of human igg1.  xxxd105xxx  has a number of effects in vitro including decreasing t cell alloreactivity and stimulating nk-mediated lysis
of target cells. the proposed mechanism of action of  xxxd105xxx  is to bridge lymphocytes and nk cells by binding to
 xxxg377xxx  and  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx , respectively [4,13,14]. theoretically, this
activates the nk cell to release its cytotoxic granules leading to lymphocyte apoptosis. however, these in vitro
experiments used significantly higher doses of  xxxd105xxx 
than were used in subsequent clinical trials, and also nonphysiological doses of nk: t cells, so it is difficult to establish their relevance to in vivo mechanisms of action.
recently, several groups have further classified memory t
cell subpopulations (cd45ro+ or cd45ra-), describing
cells by correlating surface phenotype and function
[15,16]. central memory t cells (tcm) are ccr7+, express
additional lymph-node homing receptors, lack immediate effector function, and differentiate into ccr7- cells on
secondary stimulation. effector memory t cells (tem) are
ccr7-, demonstrate receptors for inflamed tissue, and are
capable of immediate effector function. effector cd8+ t
cells can be further defined as cd45ra+ cd27- and cd28[17]. these cells secrete interferon (ifn)-gamma and tumor
necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, require exogenous cytokines for
proliferation such as il-2 and il-15, and have cytolytic
function.
we applied this more specific classification system to evaluate the relative t cell reduction caused by  xxxd105xxx  treatment. studies to date have shown that there is a dose
dependant reduction in circulating cd4+ and cd8+
cd45ro+ memory t cells [4], which remained reduced
with a second course of  xxxd105xxx  [18]. we found that
cd4+ and cd8+ effector memory t cells (tem) (ccr7cd45ra-) were significantly decreased, with relatively less
effect on central memory t cells (tcm) (ccr7+ cd45ra-)
and naïve t cells (ccr7+cd45ra+). there were also
reductions in circulating cd8+ effector t cells (ccr7cd45ra+) and type 1 t cells ( xxxg1141xxx  producing t cells).
the relative preservation of naïve and central memory t
cells is an important finding of this study.

methods
study design
twenty-two patients with moderate to severe psoriasis (19
males, 3 females, ages 29–68 years, median 49 years) were
enrolled in this study, which was approved by the rockefeller university hospital institutional review board,
and completed in 2003. informed consent was obtained.
this group of patients has been described previously [19].
major inclusion criteria were: involvement of psoriasis
vulgaris of >10% body surface area, no treatment for at
least 4 weeks prior to entering the study, no significant
infections nor immunosuppression, and no significant
renal, hepatic or other medical disease. patients were
treated with twelve 7.5 mg weekly intravenous doses of
 xxxd105xxx , and the effect of this fusion protein on circulating t cells was studied by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (facs). two patients withdrew due to non-response
and did not have final blood draws or biopsies.
peripheral blood and skin samples
peripheral blood draws were taken at 0, 1, 6 and 24 hours,
and weeks 2, 4 and 13, before drug administration. neutrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte counts were determined by routine complete blood count. peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) were isolated from
heparinized samples using standard  xxxd3253xxx -hypaque
(pharmacia biotech inc., piscataway, new jersey) density
gradient sedimentation. pbmcs were frozen in 10%
dimethylsulfoxide (dmso; atcc, manassas, vermont) in
rpmi-1640 (gibco-brl life technologies, rockville,
maryland) with 1 mm hepes buffer (sigma aldrich, st.
louis, missouri), 0.1% gentamicin (gibco-brl life technologies) and 5% normal human serum (c-six diagnostics, germantown, wisconsin), and stored at -80°c until
required. skin punch biopsies were obtained at baseline
(nonlesional and lesional), 2, 6 and 13 weeks (lesional).
tissue was frozen in oct compound (sakura finetechnical, tokyo, japan) and stored at -80°c for immunohistochemistry, and liquid nitrogen for rna extraction.

histologic response (remission) of psoriatic lesions was
defined by normalization of keratin 16 expression (negative in normal epidermis) in week 13 biopsies and marked
reduction in epidermal hyperplasia (quantified by computer- assisted image analysis) [19]. change in epidermal
thickness was calculated as a percentage by the following
formula [(epidermal thickness at week 13 - epidermal
thickness at week 0)/epidermal thickness at week 0] ×
100. other cases showed a range of outcomes that varied
from some reduction in epidermal hyperplasia (but sustained keratin 16 expression) to no improvement in
hyperplasia. these cases are termed "nonresponders".

peripheral blood mononuclear cell phenotype
pbmcs were stained for 15 minutes at room temperature
with the following antibodies (5 µl/105 cells):  xxxg377xxx ,
 xxxg375xxx , cd45ra (fluorescein isothiocyanate, fitc), cd8,
 xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx , cd27, cd45ro,  xxxg1203xxx , cd56 (phycoerythrin,
pe), cd3, cd4, cd8 (peridinin-chlorophyll-protein,
percp), cd3, cd45ro (allophycocyanin, apc) (becton
dickinson),  xxxg1205xxx  (fitc) (immunotech, westbrook,
maine), cd103 (fitc) (biodesign international), cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (cla/heca) (fitc) (bd
pharmingen), lfa-3tip (pe) (bd pharmingen, custom
design), ccr7 (pe) (r & d system, minnesota). appropriate igg isotype controls were also used (becton dickinson). cells were washed with facswash [0.1% sodium
azide (sigma aldrich), 2% fetal calf serum (gibco-brl
life technologies) in phosphate buffered saline] and
resuspended in 1.3% formaldehyde (fisher scientific) in
facswash. samples were analyzed within 24 hours with
four color staining using a facscalibur flow cytometer
and cellquest software after calibration with calibrite
beads and facscomp sotware (becton dickinson).
whole blood intracellular cytokine staining
heparinized whole blood was activated for 4 hours using
25 ng/ml phorbol  xxxd2681xxx  acetate (pma) and 2 µg/ml
 xxxd2379xxx , in the presence of 10 µg/ml brefeldin a
(sigma aldrich corp, st. louis). ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid was added (2 mm, fisher). red blood cells were
lysed using facs lysing solution (becton dickinson),
cells were washed and frozen in the media described
above (10% dmso, 5% phs in rpmi). unactivated control cells were included in the assays. prior to cytokine
staining, cells were thawed, washed and permeabilized
using facs permeabilizing solution (becton dickinson).
facs analysis was performed using antibodies specific for
intracellular  xxxg1141xxx , il-2 (fitc), tnf-alpha, il-4 (pe) (becton
dickinson) and il-10 (pe) (bd pharmingen).
t cell activation (cd69 expression)
pbmcs were activated in vitro using 1 µg/ml  xxxd2676xxx  (anticd3) (ortho biotech, toronto, canada) or 1 µg/ml  xxxg377xxx .1
and  xxxg377xxx .2 (anti- xxxg377xxx ) (immunotech) for 4 hours. early t
cell (cd3-fitc) activation was measured by surface
expression of cd69 (fitc). samples were analyzed by
facs as described for pbmc phenotype.
statistics
data were transformed into logarithmic data due to the
biological variability of the data and to accommodate outliers, and so averages are presented as geometric means.
change at week 13 was compared to baseline using a 2tailed, paired student's t test; significance was accepted as
p < 0.05.

results
analysis of histologic response of psoriasis to  xxxd105xxx 
administration
the patients demonstrated better than expected clinical
response rates, with 45% (10/22) of patients achieving an
improvement of psoriasis activity and severity index
(pasi) greater than 70%, with a mean overall reduction in
pasi of 50%. after  xxxd105xxx  administration, 55% (12 of
22) of patients were judged to have disease remission by
histologic criteria (outlined in materials and methods),
and are termed "responders". the other 10 patients were
termed "non-responders".
 xxxd105xxx  preferentially decreases circulating memory t
cell subsets
there is a dramatic reduction of peripheral lymphocytes
(38% reduction) and monocytes (58% reduction) during
the first hour of  xxxd105xxx  administration, with quick
recovery within days [20]. monocytes returned to baseline
levels, but lymphocyte counts were reduced by 23% over
the subsequent 12 weeks. table 1 lists the changes in various populations of circulating lymphocytes after 12
weeks of  xxxd105xxx  administration. t cells were the main
population of lymphocytes that showed a decrease in
absolute cell number, whereas only slight changes were
seen in b cells and nk cells.

a variety of different leukocyte markers were used to
quantify naïve t cell populations and memory t cell populations, including specific populations of memory t cells
specialized for homing to skin/epithelium and inflammatory sites (table 1). naïve populations of cd4+ and cd8+
t cells were affected to a comparatively small extent by
 xxxd105xxx , whereas memory populations were mainly targeted by this agent. for example, memory cd4+ t cells
were decreased by a mean of 40%, and cd8+ memory
cells were decreased by a mean of 65%. t cells that were
differentiated for skin homing (cla+), epithelial homing
(cd103+) or for binding to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 or intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (cd49dhi and
lfa-1hi, respectively) were strongly affected by  xxxd105xxx 
in the peripheral circulation. these observations suggest
that cell populations which differentiate for homing to
peripheral tissues (effector memory t cells) might be
selectively targeted by  xxxd105xxx  in psoriasis patients.
while circulating cd4+ and cd8+ memory cells were
reduced in all patients, there was some correlation
between cd4+ and cd8+ tcm lymphocyte subpopulations and change in pasi (r = 0.54, and r = 0.47, respectively).
 xxxd105xxx  selectively targets circulating effector memory t
cells (tem)
memory populations of cd4+ and cd8+ t lymphocytes
can be divided into t cell populations that home mainly

to lymph nodes, central memory t cells (tcm), versus
effector memory t cells (tem), which home mainly to
peripheral or inflammatory sites. the expression of ccr7
and cd45ra was used to classify cd4+ or cd8+ t cells as
naïve (ccr7+ cd45ra+), tcm (ccr7+ cd45ra-) or tem
(ccr7- cd45ra-) [15]. in cd4+ t cells, the tem population was consistently affected to a much larger extent than
the tcm population (table 1) (mean reductions compared to baseline of 63%, p < 10-4 versus 27%, not significant). similarly, tem cells in the cd8+ population were
affected more than tcm cells (mean reductions of 63%,
versus 47%, both p < 10-4). at week 13, the difference in
cd4+ tcm versus tem, as well as cd8+ tcm versus tem
was also significant, (p < 10-4; 0.005 respectively).
 xxxd105xxx  selectively reduces circulating type 1 t cells
because there is an increase in circulating type 1 t cells in
psoriasis patients [3], we measured the effect of  xxxd105xxx 
on circulating populations of type 1 ( xxxg1141xxx -producing)
and type 2 (il-4-producing) t cells by flow cytometry
(fig. 1). ninety percent of t cells at baseline and week 13
could be successfully activated by pma and inonmycin, as
judged by induction of cd69 (data not shown). type 1 t

cells were consistently reduced after  xxxd105xxx  administration (mean reduction 59%, p < 0.0001). consistent reductions in tnf-alpha-producing and il-2 producing t cell
subsets were also measured, but the overall effect was
smaller than on  xxxg1141xxx -producing t cells. there was much
less intracellular cytokine expression in the type 2
cytokines il-4 and il-10, so interpretation is less meaningful. there was a 2% mean reduction for il-4 (p = 0.94)
and 32.9% mean reduction of il-10 (p = 0.03).
 xxxd105xxx  does not affect expression of cd69 after
activation of pbmcs
in vitro activation of pbmcs with  xxxd2676xxx  and anti- xxxg377xxx 
monoclonal antibodies  xxxg377xxx .1 and  xxxg377xxx .2 showed no statistically significant difference in activation as measured
by surface cd69 expression at week 13 compared to baseline (fig. 2).

higher expression of  xxxg377xxx  compared to tcm populations
and that slight (but statistically significant) reductions in
average  xxxg377xxx  mfi values were measured on memory cell
populations after  xxxd105xxx  administration. in overall
terms, levels of  xxxg377xxx  expression strongly parallels reductions in the respective cell populations in the peripheral
circulation after  xxxd105xxx  administration. this difference,
in turn, may be produced by quantitative differences in
 xxxd105xxx  binding to t cells.

discussion
 xxxd105xxx  is the first therapeutic agent targeted to t lymphocytes that has been shown to have a selective effect on
effector memory t cells (tem) versus central memory t
cells (tcm) in humans. our results suggest that differential effects of  xxxd105xxx  on naïve versus tcm and tem t cell
pools relates to increased  xxxg377xxx  expression on effector t
cells (table 1) and thus differential binding of  xxxd105xxx  to
surface  xxxg377xxx  molecules. the decreases in circulating populations that are differentiated as type 1 effectors (lfa1hi, vla-4hi, alphaebeta7+, cla+, and  xxxg1141xxx -producing t cells)

argue for roles of these t cell subsets in disease pathogenesis, and indeed these t cell subsets are concentrated in
skin lesions. peripheral type 1 deviation previously
observed in psoriasis [3] seems to be largely corrected
through  xxxd105xxx  administration, as type 1 t cells are significantly reduced at week 13, but type 2 (il-4 producing)
t cells are comparatively unaffected (fig. 1).
an encouraging finding of this study is that central memory t cells (tcm) and naïve t cells are relatively preserved.
this may be beneficial as there is realistic concern about
toxicity caused by t cell-targeted immunosuppressives,
particularly in the ability to sustain immunologic memory
and to mount immune responses to new pathogens.
recall responses to intradermal antigens are preserved, as
are antibody responses to a neoantigen (phix174) [21].
although it is not yet clear which cells are actually most
important for maintaining immunological memory, it is
logical that maintenance of the naïve and central memory
populations should leave primary and recall responses
intact. also, the changes in lymphocyte population with
 xxxd105xxx  are opposite to those occurring in aging individuals (immune senescence) where naïve t cells are
decreased and memory populations are increased [22].

although there is a consistent reduction in circulating
memory t cells in all patients, it is puzzling that there is
not a better correlation between clinical response and circulating memory cell reductions; that is, everyone has a
relative reduction in t cells, but not everyone gets better.
the correlation coefficients for change in pasi and memory cd4 (cd45ro+) and cd8+ t cells (cd45ra-) are
similar to previously reported studies [4]. it is likely for
clinical and histological response, changes at the tissue
level are more important than those in the circulation. in
lesional psoriatic tissue, response to  xxxd105xxx  therapy correlates extremely well with reductions in infiltrating lymphocytes (r = 0.9), lesional dcs and inflammatory genes
[19].

 xxxg377xxx  targeted therapeutics have been successful at delaying rejection of allogeneic organ transplants in model systems, but have been less successful at reversing ongoing
rejection reactions [23] and, generally, effects of these
agents to decrease t cell antigen reactivity is restricted to
the period of initial antigen exposure. it is interesting that
 xxxd105xxx  is effective in certain psoriasis patients, which is
an established reaction. we examined the ability of t cells
to be activated before and after  xxxd105xxx  administration
through cd3 antibodies or by use of mitogenic  xxxg377xxx  antibody combinations. while slight decreases in t cell activation were seen at week 13 after cd3 and  xxxg377xxx  ligation,
cells remained quite activatable, which is distinctly different from previous in vitro studies which observed anergic
effects of  xxxd105xxx  [9].

tnf  xxxg2296xxx 

thus, the mechanism of t cell reductions remains to be
established. possible mechanisms of action include the
previously proposed bridging effect between t cells and
nk cells leading to direct lymphocyte cell death. while we
have not found any evidence of apoptosis in the circulation (data not shown), this may be occurring slowly at
least at the tissue level. secondly,  xxxd105xxx  may preferentially bind to lesional t cells, resulting in a disruption of
the organization of t cells and dcs in the tissue [2].
thirdly, binding of  xxxd105xxx  to lymphocyte  xxxg377xxx  may
result in sequestration of the bound cell from the circulation into lymphoid organs, and subsequent depletion. a
fourth possibility is that there is a relative increase in tissue regulatory t cells.

conclusion
this study is a detailed analysis of the effects of  xxxd105xxx 
on the circulating subpopulations of lymphocytes, and
the relative preservation of the naïve and central memory
t cells is an important finding. there are also reductions
in the putative pathogenic populations in psoriasis, tem
and type 1 t cells.
