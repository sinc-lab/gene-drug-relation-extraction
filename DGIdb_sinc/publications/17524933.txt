abstract
both tacrolimus (tac) and sirolimus (srl) bind to the same immunophilin  xxxg798xxx ;
however, their mechanisms of action are distinct. srl inhibits mammalian target of
rapamycin (tor), which is an enzyme critical to the immune function. tor inhibition
blocks the signal that mediates t-cell proliferation by preventing cell-cycle progression
from g1 to s phase. moreover, tor inhibition results in a decrease in antibody
production by blocking b-cell proliferation and maturation into antibody producing cells.
the use of srl has resulted in a decrease in the number of rejection episodes. as with
other immunosuppressive agents, srl can cause dose-related side effects, the most
notable of which are hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. thus, therapeutic drug monitoring to assess efficacy and toxicity has became a
necessity. srl blood levels do not correlate with its bioactivity and are affected by the
concomitant use of other immunosuppressive drugs. to determine the bioactivity of srl
we have developed an assay to determine the level of sirolimus per lymphocyte of
transplant patients. the levels were correlated with lymphocyte count.
methods. whole blood samples from patients on srl were collected in ethylene
diamine tetra-acetic acid (edta) vacutainer tubes. immediately the lymphocytes from 2
ml of blood were separated using 1.5 ml of  xxxd3253xxx  gradient, by centrifugation for 30
minutes at 2500 rpm. the lymphocytes were washed three times with phosphate-bufferd
saline and the pellet suspended in 150 ␮l of middle east research institute (meri) drug
extraction solution (beirut, lebanon), which was then added to 300 ␮l of imx solublizing
reagent. the cytoplasmic srl concentrations in lymphocytes were measured using kits
supplied from abbott diagnostics or by high-performance liquid tomography. a corresponding whole blood sample from each patient was used to measure blood levels. to
determine the level per lymphocyte, the value obtained was divided by the number of
lymphocytes and expressed as pg/cell. a pharmacokinetic profile for both blood and
lymphocytes was constructed for each patient using data corresponding to predose c0, 1
hour (c1) and 2 hours (c2) after the dose. the lymphocyte enumeration for c0, c1, and c2
was performed using the facs calibur flow cytometer from becton dickinson. the
average dose was 2.86 ⫾ 1.27 mg/d with a c0 ⫽ 8.05 ⫾ 4.24, c1 ⫽ 21.9 ⫾ 8.9 ng/ml, and

(pg/cell) and the lymphocyte count (r2 ⫽ .6.06). the higher the concentration of the drug
the lower the lymphocyte counts. the assay is sensitive to within 0.45 pg/cell, reproducible
with a coffcient of variance (cv) of 6.4% within assay and 7.5% for intraassay.

t

he antifungal agent sirolimus (srl) is currently
used as a potent immunosuppressive agent. it is produced by the fermentation of streptomyces hygroscopicu.1,2
srl binds to the immunophilin fk-binding protein 12
(fk-bp12) within the target cell. the complex of srl and
fk-bp12 binds to, and inhibts the activity, of the regulatory
protein, mammalian  xxxg1478xxx  (tor). the inhibition of m tor leads to a decrease in t-lymphocyte
proliferation and inhibition of the progression from g1 to
the s phase of the cell cycle which leads to immunosuppression.3,4 in many studies, srl has been shown to be an
effective immunosuppressive agent especially in combination with low doses of cyclosporine (csa).5,6 as in the case
of other immunosuppressive agents, srl causes doserelated side effects, the most notable of which are hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. thus, therapeutic drug monitoring to assess
efficacy and toxicity has become necessary. srl blood level
monitoring, which is recommended by the drug manufacturer, may not correlate with its bioactivity and are affected
by the concomitant use of other immunosuppressive drugs.
previously we have shown that the bioactivity of csa
corrlates better with the clinical condition more than the
blood levels.7–12 to determine the bioactivity of srl we
developed an assay to determine the level of srl in
lymphocytes of transplant patients. we correlated the levels
with lymphocyte count.

using data corresponding to c0, c1, and c2. the lymphocyte
enumeration for c0, c1, and c2 was performed using a flow
cytometer facs calibur (becton dickinson).

results

the average dose was 2.86 ⫾ 1.27 mg/d with a c0 of 8.05 ⫾
4.24, c1 21.9 ⫾ 8.9 ng/ml and c2 23 ⫾ 0.03 ng/ml when
samples were assayed on the imx instruments, versus 6.97 ⫾
1.5, 26.1 ⫾ 12.1, and 24.36 ⫾ 9.32 ng/ml for the hplc. the
white blood cell count (wbc) was 7917 ⫾ 1151 and
lymphocyte count 1538 ⫾ 257. although there was a trend
to a correlation (p ⫽ .0775) between dose and c0; there was
no correlation between dose or c0 srl level and lymphocyte count, (r2 ⫽ .137; fig 1a). the correlations between
dose and c1 or c2 levels were less significant than the c0
levels, namely, p ⫽ .49 and p ⫽ .57 for c1 and c2,
respectively. similarly there was no correlation between c1,
or c2 and lymphocyte count r2 ⫽ 0.107 and r2 ⫽ 0.091,
respectively.

material and methods
whole blood samples from 42 renal transplant patients (30 men
and 12 women) on srl were collected in edta tubes three
samples were obtained from each patient corresponding to predose
(c0), 1 hour (c1), and 2 hours (c2) postdose times. immediately
the lymphocytes from 2 ml of blood were separated by centrifugation for 30 minutes at 2500 rpm using 1.5 ml of  xxxd3253xxx  gradient.
the lymphocytes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered
saline and the pellet suspended in 150 ␮l of the patent solution
(meri) drug extraction solution (beirut, lebanon), which was
then added to 300 ␮l of microparticle enzyme immunoassay
(meia, abbott diagnostics) srl precipitating/solubilizing reagent for samples anyalzed on the abbott meia analyzer (imx).
for the high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) the srl
was further extracted with 1-chlorobutane and evaporated. the
extract was reconstituted with a mixture of acetonitrile water,
70/30% v/v and analyzed at 50°c using a reverse phase column
(20 ⫻ 4.5 mm) with a pore size of 4.5 ␮m. detection was performed
at wave length of 280 nm using a diaod detector (waters).
lymphocyte cytoplasmic srl concentrations were measured on
either the imx using kits (abbott diagnostics), or on hplc. a
corresponding whole blood sample from each patient was used to
measure concentrations on each instrument. to determine the
level per lymphocyte, the value was divided by the number of
lymphocytes and expressed as pg/cell. a pharmacokinetic profile
for both blood and lymphocytes was constructed for each patient

srl c0 level/lymphocyte. b. pharmacokinetic profile of srl c0
blood levels versus lymphocyte count.

however, there was a strong correlation between the
pg/cell for c0, c1, and c2 and the lymphocyte count (r2 ⫽
.606; fig 1b, and r2 ⫽ .499 and 0.509, respectively. the
higher the concentration of the drug the lower the lymphocyte count. the within assay cv was 6.4% and the between
assay was 7.5%.
discussion

lymphocyte level monitoring is currently being used as a
method to follow transplant patients.7–13 however, to expand the use of this method to all immunosuppressant
drugs, we developed a reagent that extracts drugs from the
cells. the meri solution has been used sucessfully to
extract csa, tacrolimus, and  xxxd2677xxx  from
lymphocytes and measured levels have been used to monitor transplant patients (data presented elsewhere). the
assay is sensitive to 0.45 pg/cell, with a cv of 6.4% within
the assay and 7.5% between assays. the imx method
yielded higher values of srl than the hplc technique.
this method renders it possibile to measure drug concentrations at the site of action, the lymphocyte.
