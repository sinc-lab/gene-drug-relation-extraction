the in¯uence of autonomic neurotransmitters on the growth and melanogenesis of cultured uveal
melanocytes was studied. uveal melanocytes were cultured with medium supplemented with camp
elevating agents and basic ®broblast growth factor (complete medium). the cells were plated into
multiple well plates, and various concentrations of adrenergic and cholinergic agents were added to the
media (complete medium or various deleted media). after 6 days, the cells were detached for cell
counting and melanin measurement and compared to controls. epinephrine,  xxxd2401xxx , salbutamol
and  xxxd2583xxx  (adrenergic agonists that can activate b2-adrenoceptors) substantially stimulated
growth and melanogenesis of cultured uveal melanocytes in camp-deleted medium.  xxxd2601xxx ,
clonidine, prenalterol and d-7114 (adrenergic agonists that do not activate b2-adrenoceptors) showed
no effect under similar experimental conditions. muscarine (a cholinergic agonist) inhibited the growth
and melanogenesis of uveal melanocytes in complete medium. it indicates that adrenergic agents (b2adrenoceptor agonists) stimulate growth and melanogenesis in uveal melanocytes, while cholinergic
agonist has an inhibitory effect. this effect appears to involve the camp second messenger system. these
studies suggest that homeostasis of the uveal melanocytes may be maintained, in part, by regulating the

1. introduction
iris pigmentation results mainly from the presence of
uveal melanocytes (um) and the iris pigment epithelium (ipe). individual differences in iris color are
determined primarily by variable melanin content in
iridial melanocytes (eagle, 1988; imesch et al., 1996;
wilkerson et al., 1996). iris depigmentation occurs in
sympathetic nerve paralysis (horner's syndrome), and
interruption of the sympathetic pathway in experimental animals also causes iris depigmentation and
decreases tyrosinase activity in the iris and choroid
(laties, 1974). ultrastructural and neurohistochemical studies in human and various experimental
animals suggest close contact between uveal melanocytes and both adrenergic and cholinergic nerve
termini (wolter, 1960; feeney and hogan, 1961;
ehiger, 1966; hogan, alvarado and weddell, 1971;
laties, 1972, 1974; ringvold, 1975; mukuno and
witmer, 1977; tamm et al., 1997). these ®ndings
indicate the presence of innervation of um. it is possible that the growth and melanogenesis of uveal
melanocytes may be regulated by the autonomic
nervous system. however, the effects of adrenergic

and cholinergic stimulation on the um and the types
of neurotransmitter receptors involved have not been
investigated thoroughly.
we have developed methods for isolation and
culture of human um. the um grow well and can
divide 35±50 times in vitro (hu, mccormick and
ritch, 1993a; hu et al., 1993b). cultured um express
tyrosinase activity and produce melanin in vitro.
the melanin content of cultured um correlates with
the melanin content in vivo (hu et al., 1995, 1997).
therefore, these cells can be a good model for studying the cell biology of um. in the present study, we
investigated the effects of various neurotransmitters
and receptor selective adrenoceptor agonists (table i)
on the growth and melanogenesis of cultured um.

toxin,  xxxd2388xxx  ( xxxd2388xxx ), epinephrine,
phenylephrine,  xxxd2601xxx , clonidine,  xxxd2583xxx  and  xxxd2401xxx  were obtained from sigmaaldrich (st. louis, mo, u.s.a.). human recombinant
 xxxg787xxx  was obtained from promega (madison, wi,
u.s.a.). prenalterol, salbutamol and d-7114 were
obtained from astra (worcester, ma, u.s.a.), glaxo
(ware, u.k.) and ici (maccles®eld, u.k.), respectively.
cell culture
human um were isolated from adult donor eyes as
previously described (hu et al., 1993b). the isolated
um were cultured with fic medium, which is f12
medium supplemented with 10 % fbs, 2 mm glutamine, 20 ng ml ÿ1  xxxg787xxx , 0.1 mm  xxxd2388xxx , 10 ng ml ÿ1
cholera toxin, and 50 mg ml ÿ1 gentamicin. after
reaching con¯uence, the um were detached using
trypsin±edta solution, diluted 1 : 3±1 : 6, and subcultured.
experiments
the um used in this study consisted of four cell
lines, two isolated from the iris and two from the
choroid. these cells had been in culture for no longer
than 2 months and had been passaged three to six
times at a dilution of 1 : 3±1 : 4. the purity of the cell
lines was demonstrated by immunocytochemical
methods. um displayed s-100 antigen but no cytokeratin antigen, the pigment epithelial cells displayed
both antigens, and the ®broblasts displayed neither of
these antigens (hu et al., 1993b).
the um were plated into 12 well plates with fic
medium at a density of 5  104 cells per well. after
24 hr, the fic medium was replaced with 1.0 ml of
the test media. the media were replaced every 3 days,
and the cells were cultured for 6 days. after 6 days,
the cells were detached by trypsin and counted using
a hemocytometer. detached cells were treated with
sodium hydroxide (1 m) to extract the melanin. the

amount of melanin was then measured using a
spectrophotometer at 475 nm and compared with a
standard curve to determine the amount of melanin
present (expressed as mg per well).
effect of adrenergic agonists. the base medium
used was camp-deleted medium, which consisted of
f12 medium with 10 % fbs and 20 ng ml ÿ1  xxxg787xxx .
various adrenergic agonists (epinephrine,  xxxd2401xxx , phenylephrine, clonidine,  xxxd2601xxx ,
prenalterol, salbutamol, d-7114 and  xxxd2583xxx 
at a concentration of 10 ÿ5 m) were added to test their
effects. phenylephrine, clonidine and  xxxd2601xxx 
were tested both in camp-deleted medium and  xxxg787xxx /
tpa-deleted medium (medium with serum, campelevating agents but without  xxxg787xxx  and tpa). each
was tested in triplicate. um cultured with campdeleted medium,  xxxg787xxx /tpa-deleted medium and
complete medium (fic medium) were used as
negative and positive controls, respectively.
effect of  xxxd2401xxx  in various media. the b-adrenoceptor agonist  xxxd2401xxx  was selected as a
model for further studies on the effect of adrenergic
agonist on um in various media. the base media used
included serum-deleted medium (medium with fic,
but without serum), camp-deleted medium,  xxxg787xxx /
tpa-deleted medium, and complete medium (fic
medium).  xxxd2401xxx  (10 ÿ5 m) was added to test
its effect on cell growth and melanogenesis in various
types of media. each was tested in triplicate. um
cultured with complete medium (fic medium) and
various deleted media were used as negative and
positive controls, respectively.
dose-dependent effects of  xxxd2401xxx . the base
medium used was camp-deleted medium.  xxxd2401xxx  was added in graded concentrations (from
10 ÿ10 to 10 ÿ5 m), each concentration was tested in
triplicate. um cultured with camp-deleted medium
and complete medium (fic medium) were used as
negative and positive controls, respectively.
effects of phenylephrine at different concentrations in
various media. phenylephrine stimulated cell growth
and melanogenesis in camp-deleted medium at a
concentration of 10 ÿ5 m. phenylephrine activates both
a- and b-adrenoceptors. in order to elucidate which
receptor phenylephrine activated in um, phenylephrine (10 ÿ7 ±10 ÿ5 m) was added to um cultured
with camp-deleted medium,  xxxg787xxx /tpa-deleted
medium and serum-deleted medium. each concentration was tested in triplicate. um cultured with
complete medium (fic medium) and various deleted
media were used as negative and positive controls,
respectively.
effects of cholinergic agonist. the base media used
were serum-deleted medium and complete medium.

n e u r ot r a n s m i t t e r s a n d u v e a l m e l a n o c y t e s

muscarine was added at various concentrations from
10 ÿ6 to 10 ÿ4 m to test its effects. each was tested in
triplicate. um cultured with complete medium (fic
medium) and serum-deleted medium were used as
controls.
effect of deletion of adrenergic agonist. the um were
plated into 6 well plates at a cell density of 2  104
and cultured with camp-deleted medium supplemented with  xxxd2401xxx  (10 ÿ5 m). three days later,
 xxxd2401xxx  was deleted from the culture medium in
21 wells of um. cells were detached from three wells
for cell counting and melanin measurement every
3 days for 3 weeks. um cultured with  xxxd2401xxx 
supplemented medium were used as positive controls.
some tested neurotransmitters are not stable and
are easily oxidized, therefore an antioxidant, ascorbic
acid (10 ÿ5 m), was added to all culture media to
protect the tested substances.
student's t-test was used to assess statistical
signi®cance.

3. results
um cultured with camp-deleted medium grew
slowly and showed a decrease of melanin content/
culture. addition of epinephrine, phenylephrine,  xxxd2401xxx , salbutanol and  xxxd2583xxx  at a concentration of 10 ÿ5 m resulted in signi®cant stimulation
of growth and an increase in the melanin content/
culture (p 5 0.01) (table ii).  xxxd2601xxx , clonidine, prenalterol and d-7114 at a concentration of
10 ÿ5 m showed no effect on cell growth or melanin
content (table ii). phenylephrine, clonidine and  xxxd2601xxx  at a concentration of 10 ÿ5 m showed no
effects in  xxxg787xxx /tpa-deleted medium (data not shown).

um cultured with  xxxg787xxx /tpa-deleted medium and
serum-deleted medium grew slowly or did not grow,
and melanin content/culture decreased in cells cultured with serum-deleted medium.  xxxd2401xxx 
(10 ÿ5 m) stimulated cell growth signi®cantly in cells
cultured with camp-deleted medium and to a lesser
degree in  xxxg787xxx /tpa-deleted medium and complete
medium, but not in serum-deleted medium, indicating
that  xxxd2401xxx  mainly activated the camp system
[fig. 1(a)].
 xxxd2401xxx  stimulated growth and melanogenesis in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations ranging from 10 ÿ10 to 10 ÿ5 m [fig. 1(b)]. the
difference in melanin content/culture and cell counts
between the negative control and the test groups
were statistically signi®cant (0.05 4 p 4 0.01 at
concentrations of 10 ÿ8 ±10 ÿ9 m and p 5 0.01 at
concentrations of 10 ÿ7 ±10 ÿ5 m).
phenylephrine stimulated growth and melanogenesis of um only in cells cultured with campdeleted medium and at a concentration of 10 ÿ5 m
(p 5 0.01). phenylephrine did not affect the cell
number and melanin content of um in  xxxg787xxx /tpadeleted medium and serum-deleted medium (10 ÿ6 ±
10 ÿ5 m) and in camp-deleted medium at a concentration of 10 ÿ6 m [fig. 2(a)]. these results indicate
that phenylephrine only activates the camp system at
a high concentration. therefore, it is possible that the
effect of phenylephrine on um is related to activation
of b-adrenoceptors of um, since phenylephrine is well
known to possess weak b-adrenoceptor agonist properties (cantacuzene et al., 1979; nimit et al., 1980).
muscarine inhibited the growth and melanogenesis
of um cultured with complete medium and serumdeleted medium [fig. 2(b)]. the differences of melanin
content/culture and cell counts between the control
and test groups were statistically signi®cant (cell

ceased to grow, became degenerated and detached

all data mentioned above were based on the study
of a melanocyte cell line from iris. the effects of
neurotransmitters on growth and melanogenesis of

4. discussion
there are two types of melanin-synthesizing cells
in the iris: the ipe and iridal melanocytes (hogan
et al., 1971; mund, rodrigues and fine, 1972; zinn
et al., 1973; imesch et al., 1996; wilkerson et al.,
1996). the ipe is located at the posterior surface of

f ig . 3. effect of deletion of  xxxd2401xxx  on the growth
and melanogenesis of uveal melanocytes. uveal melanocytes were plated into 6 well plates and cultured with
camp-deleted medium supplemented with  xxxd2401xxx 
(10 ÿ5 m), 3 days later,  xxxd2401xxx  was deleted from the
culture medium in 21 wells (dashed lines). cells were
detached from three wells for cell counting and melanin
measurement every 3 days for 3 weeks. cells cultured with
 xxxd2401xxx  supplemented medium were used as positive
controls (solid line). cell number was expressed as 1  104
(mean + s.d.) (a). melanin content was expressed as mg per
well (mean + s.d.) (b).

the iris and is derived from the neuroectoderm. adult
human ipe do not produce melanin in vitro (hu et al.,
1992). the melanin in ipe does not vary signi®cantly
between irides of different colors. therefore, the ipe is
believed to play only a minor role in variations in iris
color (eagle, 1988; imesch et al., 1996; wilkerson
et al., 1996).
the melanocytes are derived from the neural crest,
are located in the stroma of the iris, and tend to cluster
near the anterior border of the stroma (hogan et al.,
1971; zinn et al., 1973; tamm et al., 1997). adult
human um do produce melanin in vitro (hu et al.,
1995). the melanin content of melanocytes, which
varies in different colored irides (both in vivo and
in vitro), is the most important factor in determining
iris color (eagle, 1988; hu et al., 1995; imesch et al.,
1996; wilkerson et al., 1996).
it has been long recognized that hypopigmentation
(congenital cases) or depigmentation (acquired cases)
of the iris on the affected side occur in patients with
paralysis of the cervical sympathetic nerve (horner's
syndrome). the mechanism of iris depigmentation in

221

horner's syndrome has been obscure. there are different hypotheses involving sympathetic nerves: these
include neurotrophic effects, control of migration, or
the supply of noradrenaline to um for use as a substrate for conversion to a melanin akin to neuromelanin (laties, 1972, 1974). electron microscopy
studies of the iris from a horner's syndrome patient
revealed depletion of um and absence of sympathetic
nerve ®bers. in contrast to the um, the ipe still
remained unaffected (mccartney et al., 1992).
in experimental animals, removing the superior
cervical ganglion or section of the sympathetic nerve
trunk below the ganglion in rabbits or cats leads to iris
depigmentation and decreased tyrosinase activity in
the iris and choroid (laties, 1972, 1974). topical
administration of adrenergic antagonist in newborn
rabbits also causes iris depigmentation (odin and
o'donnell, 1982).
neurohistochemical studies, anatomic and ultrastructure studies in various experimental animals
(cat, rabbit, rat, baboon and monkey) and humans
revealed a close relationship between adrenergic
nerve termini, postganglionic cholinergic nerve
termini and um (wolter, 1960; feeney and hogan,
1961; ehiger, 1966; hogan et al., 1971; laties, 1972,
1974; ringvold, 1975; mukuno and witmer, 1977;
tamm et al., 1997). these observations point to a
dual autonomic innervation of um. however, the
effects of adrenergic and cholinergic nerve stimulation
on melanogensis and growth of um have not been
studied, and little is known about the exact receptors
and second messenger system involved.
during the past decade, we have developed methods
for isolation and cultivation of human um, collected
many cell lines and studied factors regulating melanogenesis and growth of um in vitro (hu et al., 1993b,
1993a, 1995, 1997). we found that growth and
melanogenesis of cultured um were controlled by at
least three second messenger systems. camp elevating agents and protein kinase c activators (tpa)
stimulate melanogenesis and growth of cultured um.
 xxxg2198xxx  activators ( xxxg787xxx ) stimulate growth
but not melanogenesis of cultured um. serum,
camp-elevating agents,  xxxg787xxx  or tpa, are essential
for growth, melanogenesis and survival of cultured
um. deprivation of any factors leads to a decrease of
melanin content and or cell numbers (hu et al.,
1993a, 1997). based on our previous work, we have
developed a deletion and substitution model for studying the effects and mechanism of various substances
on um. one of the known factors is deleted from the
complete medium, and a test substance is added to the
deleted media. if the um grow and differentiate well,
then we suppose that the test substance may have a
similar mode of action as the agent deleted (hu et al.,
1993a, 1997).
in our previous studies, three parameters (melanin
content per cell, melanin content per culture and
tyrosinase activity) were used to evaluate the effect of

222

various substances on melanogenesis in cultured um
(hu et al., 1995, 1997). an important concept for
consideration is which parameter is most meaningful
to evaluate melanogenesis of um in vitro. tyrosinase
activity is an important factor, but not the sole factor
in determining the rate of melanin production (prota,
1993). the color of the iris is determined by melanin
content rather than tyrosinase activity (hu et al.,
1995). measurement of melanin content is more
direct and meaningful than that of tryosinase activity.
melanin content per culture is more important than
melanin content per cell for two reasons. first,
melanin content per cell is affected both by melanin
production rate and the growth rate. in stationary
cells, the melanin produced accumulates in the cell
and results in a rapid increase in the melanin content
per cell. in growing cells, the melanin is diluted to
daughter cells during division and results in a marked
decrease of melanin per cell (hu et al., 1997). furthermore, from the clinical view point, iris pigmentation is
a function of total melanin present in the tissue, not of
melanin content per melanocyte (hu et al., 1997).
therefore, melanin content/culture was used as the
main parameter for evaluating the effect of various
neurotransmitters on melanogenesis.
the sympathetic nervous system employs neurotransmitters that in¯uence adrenergic receptors
(table i). in the present studies, non-selective adrenergic agonist (epinephrine), non-selective b-adrenoceptor agonist ( xxxd2401xxx ), and b2-adrenoceptor
agonists (salbutamol and  xxxd2583xxx ) stimulated
the growth and the melanogenesis of um predominantly in camp-deleted medium, while a-adrenoceptor agonists (methoxanine and clonidine) and
b1- or b3-adrenoceptor agonists (prenalterol and d7114) showed no effect. these results indicate that
adrenergic agonists mainly activate b2-adrenoceptors
and elevate the intracellular camp level. phenylephrine, an adrenergic agonist, mainly activates a1adrenoceptors but also activates b-adrenoceptors at
high concentrations, only stimulated the growth and
melanogenesis of um cultured with camp-deleted
medium at high concentration. this indicates that the
effect of phenylephrine on um is also due to activation
of b-adrenoceptors um.
the parasympathetic nervous system utilizes neurotransmitters that in¯uence cholinergic receptors (nicotinic and muscarinic receptors). stimulation of
muscarinic receptors inhibit the camp system or
stimulate of phospholipase c. in the present studies,
high concentrations of muscarine inhibited growth
and melanogenesis of um, possibly by inhibiting the
camp system. there are ®ve cloned human muscarinic receptors. the effect of various muscarinic receptor
selective agonists on the um will be studied in the
future.
it has been reported that the effect of adrenergic
neurons on iris pigmentation might be related to
adrenergic a-receptors based on an experiment in

 xxxd2589xxx  hu et al.

rabbits (odin and o'donnell, 1982). however, in this
rabbit study, only one representative a- and bantagonist was tested. in the present studies, nine
different adrenergic agonists with pronounced effects
on all known sub-types of adrenergic receptors have
been tested, and all experiments were conducted using
four cell lines. the results were reproducible and the
effects were consistent for all adrenergic agonists
tested. furthermore, our results are consistent with
the results of the binding assays showing that b2adrenoceptors are the main adrenergic receptors in the
human iris-ciliary body (wax and molinoff, 1987).
therefore, it seems likely that the release of neurotransmitters from adrenergic nerves associated with
human um mainly activates b2-adrenoceptors.
the involvement of the b-adrenoceptor in melanogenesis may be regarded as unexpected, since a1- and
b1-adrenoceptors are typically regarded as being
associated with adrenergic neurotransmission (bryan
et al., 1981). this provides yet further evidence that
the b2-adrenoceptor is well represented in the human
eye (coakes and shih, 1984; nathanson, 1985;
jampel et al., 1987; wax and molinoff, 1987).
the mechanism of iris depigmentation at cell
biology level in horner's syndrome has never been
satisfactorily explained. our studies showed that
camp-elevating agents is essential for the growth,
survival and melanogenesis of um. um cultured with
camp-deleted medium supplemented with  xxxd2401xxx  could survive and produce melanin quite well.
after deletion of  xxxd2401xxx , um gradually lost
viability and capacity for production of melanin,
leading to reduced cell number and melanin content.
it seems that adrenergic innervation plays an important role in the maintenance of integrity of um.
paralysis of sympathetic nerve and deprivation of
adrenergic neurotransmitters can lead to loss of um
and melanin, which is the underlying cause for the
occurrence of iris depigmentation.
there are other diseases with iris depigmentation
which may be related to the autonomic nervous
system. for example, electron microscopy study of
irides from fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis patients
have revealed a reduction of iridial melanocyte
number and a decrease in the number and size of
melanosomes, with accompanying degeneration of
adrenergic nerves (melamed et al., 1978; mccartney,
bull and spalton, 1986). these ®ndings indicated that
the defect in melanogenesis in the um may be due to
abnormal adrenergic innervation, either primary or
secondary to the in¯ammatory process (mccartney
et al., 1986).
in summary, adrenergic agonists (mainly b2adrenergic agonists) stimulate growth and melanogenesis in um, while cholinergic agonist has an
inhibitory effect. this effect may be mediated by camp
as the second messenger system. these studies indicate that homeostasis of um may be maintained by
the autonomic nervous system in vivo.
