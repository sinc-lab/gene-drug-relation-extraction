abstract
background: the investigational cftr potentiator  xxxd2408xxx  ( xxxd2408xxx ) increased cftr channel activity and improved lung function in subjects
with cf who have the g551d cftr gating mutation. the aim of this in vitro study was to determine whether  xxxd2408xxx  potentiates mutant cftr
with gating defects caused by other cftr gating mutations.
methods: the effects of  xxxd2408xxx  on cftr channel open probability and chloride transport were tested in electrophysiological studies using fischer rat
thyroid (frt) cells expressing different cftr gating mutations.
results:  xxxd2408xxx  potentiated multiple mutant cftr forms with defects in cftr channel gating. these included the g551d, g178r, s549n,
s549r, g551s, g970r, g1244e, s1251n, s1255p and g1349d cftr gating mutations.
conclusion: these in vitro data suggest that  xxxd2408xxx  has a similar effect on all cftr forms with gating defects and support investigation of the
potential clinical beneﬁt of  xxxd2408xxx  in cf patients who have cftr gating mutations beyond g551d.

1. introduction
the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (cf) is the loss of epithelial chloride transport due to mutations in the cf transmembrane
conductance regulator gene (cftr) that encodes the cftr protein (cftr) [1]. cftr is an epithelial chloride channel that is
composed of two membrane spanning domains that form the chloride channel pore, two nucleotide-binding domains (nbd) that
bind and hydrolyze atp, and a regulatory domain with several
 xxxg1836xxx  (pka) phosphorylation sites [1]. the opening
and closing of the cftr channel pore, or channel gating, is a
tightly regulated process, requiring phosphorylation of the regulatory domain by pka and subsequent atp binding and hydrolysis by the nbds [2]. normally, cftr is present at the
epithelial cell surface where it allows chloride transport across
the epithelial cell membrane to maintain salt, fluid, and ph

balance in multiple organs [3]. in cf, cftr mutations cause a
loss of chloride transport through cftr that results in the accumulation of thick, sticky mucus in the bronchi of the lungs, loss
of exocrine pancreatic function, impaired intestinal absorption,
reproductive dysfunction and elevated sweat chloride concentrations [3–4].
there are over 1800 cftr mutations, resulting in a wide
spectrum in the severity of the loss in chloride transport and
disease phenotype [4]. evaluation of the molecular defect
caused by some of the more common cftr mutations has
shown that the loss of chloride transport can be due to a decrease in the quantity and/or function of cftr channels at
the cell surface [4–5]. for example, the most common
cftr mutation, f508del-cftr which accounts for twothirds of all cftr alleles in patients with cf [4], impairs
cftr processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (er), greatly reducing the quantity of f508del-cftr protein at the cell surface
[5]. in contrast, approximately 4–5% of patients with cf carry a
missense cftr mutation that results in cftr protein which is
present at the cell surface but does not open and close properly
(defective channel gating), resulting in minimal chloride transport

as measured in vitro or in vivo [6–8]. such cftr mutations
are called cftr gating mutations (also known as class iii mutations) [5]. the most common cftr gating mutation in patients
with cf is g551d [6–7]. other known cftr gating mutations
include g178r, g551s, g970r, g1244e, s1255p, and
g1349d [9–11].
one potential strategy to treat cf is to increase chloride
transport by restoring or enhancing cftr function with small
molecule drugs known as cftr modulators. a cftr potentiator is a type of cftr modulator that acts by increasing cftr
channel gating to enhance chloride transport. for a cftr potentiator to act, cftr at the cell surface must first be activated by
pka-dependent phosphorylation [12]. experimentally, the effect
of a cftr potentiator on channel gating can be quantified using
patch-clamp electrophysiology to directly measure the fraction of
time the channel is open, which is called the channel open
probability.  xxxd2408xxx  ( xxxd2408xxx ), an investigational cftr potentiator [12], increased the channel open probability of
g551d-cftr to enhance chloride transport in vitro [12]. in patients with cf who have the g551d mutation,  xxxd2408xxx  increased
clinical measures of chloride transport through cftr, and improved clinical measures of lung function [13].  xxxd2408xxx  has
also been shown to potentiate normal cftr and f508delcftr, suggesting that the compound is not specific for
g551d-cftr. we therefore hypothesized that  xxxd2408xxx  might
potentiate multiple mutant cftr forms with cftr gating
mutations.
in this set of in vitro studies, the ability of  xxxd2408xxx  to potentiate
mutant cftr was examined in a panel of fischer rat thyroid (frt)
cells engineered to express previously reported cftr gating mutations or cftr mutations believed to be located in the atp binding
sites required for normal channel gating [2]. the results presented
here indicated that  xxxd2408xxx  potentiated cftr channel gating
and enhanced chloride transport in all examples of cftr gating
mutations tested. these in vitro data support the investigation
of the clinical benefit of cftr potentiators such as  xxxd2408xxx ,
in patients with cf who have cftr gating mutations beyond
g551d.
2. results
2.1. generation and characterization of cell lines expressing
cftr gating mutations
to systematically compare the effects of  xxxd2408xxx  on mutant
cftr with defective channel gating, a panel of stable cell lines
was generated using frt cells. each cell line was engineered to
express a mutant cftr form with a specific cftr gating mutation or cftr mutation believed to be located in the atp
binding sites required for normal channel gating [2]. these included g551d-, g178r-, s549n-, s549r-, g551s-, g970r-,
g1244e-, s1251n-, s1255p-, and g1349d-cftr [4,7,9–11].
no significant difference (p n 0.05; anova followed tukey's
multiple comparisons test; n = 3–6) in the level of cftr
mrna was observed between normal cftr and the individual
mutant cftr forms expressed in frt cells (fig. 1a), suggesting
similar cftr protein levels.

in order to further characterize these cell lines, the delivery
of mutant cftr protein to the cell surface was indirectly
assessed in immunoblot studies that measure an increase in
the molecular mass of cftr (from a 135–140 kda band to a
170–180 kda band) due to glycosylation (fig. 1b–d), an indicator of cftr exit from the endoplasmic reticulum and passage through the golgi. after cftr is processed by the
golgi, the glycosylated cftr (mature cftr) is delivered to
the cell surface [5]. the ratio of mature to total cftr (mature + immature cftr) was used to estimate the fraction of
cftr synthesized that was processed normally and delivered
to the cell surface (fig. 1c). in addition, the steady-state level
of mature mutant cftr at the cell surface was expressed as a
percentage of that measured in four separate frt cell lines
expressing normal cftr (% normal cftr; fig. 1d).
f508del-cftr was used as a reference to calibrate severe defects in cftr processing and delivery to the cell surface [5].
this analysis showed that, as expected for known cftr gating
mutations (g551d, g178r, g551s, g970r, g1244e, s1255p,
and g1349d) [5,9–11], the amount of cftr delivered to the
cell surface was generally similar between cftr with gating
defects and normal cftr. in contrast, only a small amount of
f508del-cftr was delivered to the cell surface (fig. 1b–d).
interestingly, there was significantly more g551s-cftr at
the cell surface than normal cftr, although the total amount
of g551s-cftr synthesized and the ratio of mature to total
cftr were similar to normal cftr.

2.2.  xxxd2408xxx  increased the channel gating of mutant cftr
with defective channel gating
the effect of  xxxd2408xxx  on cftr channel gating was monitored by quantifying the channel open probability by patchclamp electrophysiology using membrane patches excised
from frt cells expressing the known cftr gating mutations,
g551d-, g178r-, g551s-, g970r-, g1244e-, s1255p-, or
g1349d-cftr. to activate cftr prior to  xxxd2408xxx  addition,
pka (75 nm) and atp (1 mm) were added to the cytoplasmic
surface (bath solution) of the membrane patch. under these
conditions, the baseline cftr channel open probability of
g551d-, g178r-, g551s-, g970r-, g1244e-, s1255p-, and
g1349d-cftr was ≤ 5% of normal cftr (fig. 2, b;
table 1). for most mutant cftr forms, the single channel current amplitude, a measure of channel conductance, was similar
to normal cftr (between 77% and 122% of normal cftr),
although a small but statistically significant difference in single
channel current amplitude was observed for s1255p-cftr
(table 1). acute (5 min) addition of 10 mum  xxxd2408xxx  increased
the channel open probability of all cftr gating mutations
tested, reaching levels equivalent to 30% to 118% of normal
cftr (fig. 2b; table 1). no change in the single channel current amplitude was observed following  xxxd2408xxx  addition
(table 1). these data indicated that  xxxd2408xxx  increased the
channel open probability of all mutant cftr forms with defective channel gating tested to a similar or greater extent
than g551d-cftr.

2.3.  xxxd2408xxx  enhanced chloride transport through mutant
cftr with defective channel gating
the impact of the increase in cftr channel gating by  xxxd2408xxx  on total chloride transport was assessed in ussing chamber studies using frt cells expressing the known cftr gating
mutations, g551d-, g178r-, g551s-, g970r-, g1244e-,
s1255p-, and g1349d-cftr. to activate cftr prior to  xxxd2408xxx  addition, 10 mum  xxxd1742xxx  was added to the bath to

several of the known cftr gating mutations cause defects
in one of the two atp binding pockets formed by the two
nbds known to regulate cftr channel gating [2]. the cfassociated cftr mutations, s549n, s549r, and s1251n, are
located in the abc signature sequence (fig. 4; lsggq;
s549n,r in nbd1) and walker a motif (fig. 4; s1251n in
nbd2), that form the atp binding sites [14]. immunoblot
and ussing chamber studies indicated that, although the maturation of s549n- and s1251n-cftr was similar to normal,
the baseline level of chloride transport was b10% of normal
cftr (figs. 1 and 3; table 2). s549r-cftr showed maturation comparable to 26 ± 2% (n = 5) of normal cftr (fig. 1d),
which did not account for the b 1% of normal cftr function
(fig. 3; table 2). these results indicated that the function of
s549n-, s549r-, and s1251n-cftr at the cell surface was
minimal. patch-clamp studies confirmed that the channel open
probability of s549n-, s549r-, and s1251n-cftr was b 5%
of normal cftr, whereas the single channel current amplitude

was 79 to 97% of normal cftr (fig. 2; table 1). taken together, these data suggested that defective channel gating was
the predominant defect in s549n-, s549r- and s1251n-cftr.

cftr gating mutations result in cftr which is present at
the cell surface but does not open or close normally, resulting
in a low cftr channel open probability and the loss of epithelial chloride transport as determined in electrophysiological
studies. in this study we focused on cftr gating mutations
resulting in minimal channel function and generally associated
with severe cf. the most common cf-causing cftr gating
mutation is g551d [6] but several other cftr gating mutations
have been previously reported [9–11]. in a panel of frt cells
expressing g551d-, g178r-, g551s-, g970r-, g1244e-,
s1255p-, and g1349d-cftr, we confirmed that all these mutant cftr forms shared similar in vitro functional characteristics that were consistent with a defect in channel gating. in
addition, we showed that the 3 additional mutations, s549n,
s549r, and s1251n also have characteristics consistent with
gating defects. these characteristics included the delivery of
cftr to the cell surface, a low (b 5%) cftr channel open
probability, and minimal (b10% normal cftr) baseline levels
of chloride transport.
 xxxd2408xxx  addition caused a n10-fold increase in cftrmediated chloride transport in frt cells expressing g551d-,
g178r-, s549n-, s549r-, g551s-, g970r-, g1244e-,
s1251n-, s1255p-, and g1349d-cftr. for all cftr gating
mutations tested, the level of chloride transport achieved in
the presence of  xxxd2408xxx  was n10% of normal cftr, which
exceeds the level of chloride transport associated with lower
sweat chloride levels and a mild cf phenotype [15]. moreover,
in patients with cf who have the g551d cftr gating mutation, administration of  xxxd2408xxx  was associated with improvements in cftr function, as determined by a reduction in
sweat chloride concentrations, and improvements in lung function, as determined by an increase in the fev1 [13]. taken together, these in vitro results provide a rationale for testing the
potential benefit of  xxxd2408xxx  in individuals with cf who have
a cftr gating mutation other than g551d, including the
g178r-, s549n-, s549r-, g551s-, g970r-, g1244e-,
s1251n-, s1255p, and g1349d cftr gating mutations.
evaluation of cf-associated cftr mutations that were
expected to cause protein alterations in the atp-binding sites
formed by the nbds indicated that s549n- and s1251ncftr also shared similar in vitro functional characteristics
with g551d-cftr and could be classified as cftr gating
mutations. unlike s549n-cftr and s1251n-cftr, s549rcftr exhibited a partial reduction in the level of cftr maturation compared to normal cftr (see also ref. [16]). the
partial reduction in s549r-cftr maturation was ~ 27% of

normal cftr and did not appear to be sufficient to account for
the b 1% normal cftr chloride transport in frt cells expressing this cftr mutation. patch-clamp studies showed that the
channel open probability of s549r-cftr was less than 1%
of normal cftr. these results indicated that although the predominant defect caused by the s549r cftr mutation was defective cftr channel gating, a mild processing defect was also
observed. the apparent mild processing defect in s549r-cftr
may account for the lower  xxxd2408xxx  response in frt cells
expressing s549r-cftr compared to the other mutant cftr
forms with gating defects and normal cftr maturation.
the low baseline levels of chloride transport in frt cells
expressing mutant cftr forms encoded by the cftr gating mutations studied here were consistent with the clinical characteristics of patients with cf who carry one of these cftr gating
mutations. patients with cf who carry the g551d cftr gating
mutation have minimal amounts of cftr function, as determined by high (~100 mmol/l) sweat chloride concentrations,
and a severe cf phenotype [8,17]. although there are limited
case studies on patients with cf who have cftr gating mutations beyond g551d, they also appear to have high sweat chloride concentrations and severe cf [18–20]. this was consistent
with the low cftr channel open probability and minimal
(b 10% normal cftr) baseline levels of chloride transport measured in frt cells expressing these cftr gating mutations. a
milder cf clinical phenotype has been associated with the
g551s cftr gating mutation, as demonstrated by a lower
sweat chloride concentration (75–94 mmol/l) and lower incidence of pancreatic insufficiency compared to patients with cf
who carry the g551d cftr gating mutation [21]. in the present
study, although the expression and channel open probability of
g551s-cftr were similar to g551d-cftr, the baseline chloride transport was higher (~9% normal cftr). this may be
due to the increased level of mature g551s-cftr delivered to
the cell surface compared to normal cftr, as determined by immunoblot studies in frt cells.
the potency (ec50) of  xxxd2408xxx  for the cftr gating mutations tested was similar to g551d in vitro, suggesting that a

similar dose of  xxxd2408xxx  as that used in clinical trials of patients
with cf who carry the g551d cftr gating mutation may be
appropriate for most other cftr gating mutations. previous
in vitro studies using recombinant cells and primary human airway cultures have shown that higher concentrations of  xxxd2408xxx 
were required to potentiate g551d-cftr compared to normaland f508del-cftr [12]. the potency of other cftr potentiators has also been shown to be lower for g551d-cftr compared to normal or f508del-cftr [12,22–25]. this suggests
that some cftr mutations may alter interaction of cftr potentiators with cftr to affect channel gating. further studies
will be needed to identify the  xxxd2408xxx  binding site on cftr
to test this hypothesis.
cftr potentiators from structural classes distinct from  xxxd2408xxx  have also been shown to potentiate mutant cftr with
defective channel gating. these included derivatives of 1,4dihydropyridine and phenylglycine which potentiated g551d-,
g970r-, and g1349d-cftr to a similar extent as  xxxd2408xxx 
[23,25–26]. in contrast, sulfamoyl-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxamides were weakly effective on g551d-, g970r-, and
g1349d-cftr [26] and phloxine b strongly potentiated
g551d-cftr, but not g1349d-cftr [22]. previous studies
have speculated that these differences may be due to distinct
binding sites which may be differentially altered by cftr mutations or which may modulate cftr channel gating through
different mechanisms [22–23,26]. these in vitro data have suggested that broad-acting cftr potentiators, like  xxxd2408xxx  and
derivatives of 1,4-dihydropyridine and phenylglycine, may
have a wider clinical utility among patients with cf who
have different cftr gating mutations compared to cftr potentiators that appear to have an effect on specific cftr
mutations.
the gating of the cftr channel pore is a tightly regulated
process, requiring phosphorylation of the regulatory domain
by pka and subsequent atp binding and hydrolysis by the
nbds [2]. like g551d, the g551s, g1244e, s1255p, and
g1349d cftr gating mutations, as well as the s549n,
s549r, and s1251n cftr gating mutations identified in the

present study, cause protein alterations in the atp binding
pockets formed by the two nbds required for normal cftr
channel gating (fig. 4) [2]. the g178r and g970r cftr gating mutations alter the intracellular cytoplasmic loops that are
believed to link the atp-driven conformational changes in
the nbds to the opening of the cftr channel pore formed
by the membrane spanning domains [27]. given the importance
of these regions in driving cftr channel opening and closing,
it was not surprising that cftr mutations associated with these
regions caused severe defects in cftr channel gating. in vitro,
 xxxd2408xxx  potentiated mutant cftr forms associated with alterations in the atp binding pockets and the cytoplasmic loops
linking the cftr channel pore to the movement of the
nbds, suggesting that  xxxd2408xxx  may bypass or augment
atp-dependent channel gating of mutant cftr to potentiate
the function of pka-activated cftr. additional studies are
needed to determine the atp dependence and molecular mechanism of cftr potentiation by  xxxd2408xxx .
in previous in vitro studies  xxxd2408xxx  potentiated chloride
transport by normal and f508del-cftr [12]. along with the
data presented here on multiple mutant cftr forms with defective channel gating,  xxxd2408xxx  appeared to be a broad-acting
cftr potentiator. this suggests that  xxxd2408xxx  may act on
other mutant cftr forms that are delivered to the cell surface
in sufficient amounts. for example, r117h-cftr is delivered
to the cell surface in normal amounts, but exhibits a ~ 20% reduction in cftr channel conductance and a ~ 75% reduction
in the channel open probability, resulting in residual cftr
function both in vitro and clinically [28]. other cftr gene mutations associated with residual cftr function include a445e,
r347h, d1152h, and certain splice mutations (3849
+ 10kbc→t) [4,29–30]. further in vitro studies and clinical
measurements are needed to evaluate the  xxxd2408xxx  response
and potential clinical benefit for cftr mutations beyond
cftr gating mutations.
in conclusion,  xxxd2408xxx  increased the channel gating activity
of all mutant cftr forms associated with cftr gating mutations tested in this study, resulting in enhanced chloride transport. this suggested that  xxxd2408xxx  is not a mutation-specific
cftr potentiator, as it overcomes the underlying molecular
defect caused by g551d and a number of other cftr gating
mutations. as a group these cftr gating mutations shared
the following characteristics; 1) defective cftr channel gating
as the predominant molecular defect, 2) residual or normal
amounts of cftr present at the cell surface, 3) minimal baseline chloride transport in vitro (b10% normal), and 4) a pronounced (n10-fold) increase over baseline chloride transport

243

in response to  xxxd2408xxx . the in vitro data presented here suggest that  xxxd2408xxx  has a similar effect on all cftr forms with
gating defects and support the investigation of  xxxd2408xxx  in patients with cf who have cftr gating mutations beyond
g551d, including g178r, s549n, s549r, g551s, g970r,
g1244e, s1251n, s1255p, and g1349d.

4.1. cell line generation
a panel of frt cell lines expressing different cftr mutations
was generated using a host cell line with a single integration site as
described in the supplementary material.
4.2. rna analysis
total rna was isolated and real-time pcr assays were performed as described in the supplementary material.
4.3. electrophysiology
ussing chamber techniques using frt cells were used to record the it due to cftr-mediated chloride transport. the
single-channel activity of cftr was measured using excised
inside-out membrane patch recordings (see supplementary
material).
4.4. cftr immunoblot analysis
immunoblot techniques using the monoclonal cftr antibody 769 (j. riordan, university of north carolina) were
used to measure cftr maturation in frt, hek-293, or hbe
cells expressing wild-type- or f508del-cftr (see supplementary material).

fig. 4. location of the amino acid alterations associated with cftr gating mutations
tested in this study. cftr is composed of two membrane spanning domains (msds)
that form an anion-selective pore, two nbds that contain the lsggq and walker a
and b (bold solid lines) motifs that form the two atp binding pockets (sites 1 and 2),
and a regulatory domain (r) that contain the pka phosphorylation sites. intracellular
cytoplasmic loops connecting the membranes spanning domains are believed to act
as molecular linkers to transfer the atp-dependent conformational changes in the
nbds to the msd, thereby opening the cftr channel pore formed by the membranes spanning domains. the cftr gating mutations tested here are believed to
cause protein alterations in the atp binding sites and cytoplasm loops.
