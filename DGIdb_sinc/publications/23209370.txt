 xxxd2209xxx  to combat toxic levels of methotrexate in patients.  in january 2012,  xxxd2209xxx  ( xxxd2209xxx (®)) received approval from the us food and drug administration for intravenous treatment of toxic plasma methotrexate concentrations due to impaired renal clearance. methotrexate, an antifolate agent, has been used for over 60 years in the treatment of various cancers. high-dose methotrexate has been particularly useful in the treatment of leukemias and lymphomas. however, even with aggressive hydration and urine alkalinization, such regimens can lead to acute renal dysfunction, as indicated by decreases in urine production and concomitant increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels. because methotrexate is largely excreted by the kidneys, this can greatly potentiate tissue damage. toxic levels of blood methotrexate can be rapidly and effectively decreased by intravenous administration of  xxxd2209xxx .  xxxd2209xxx  is a recombinant form of  xxxd2209xxx , a bacterial enzyme that rapidly cleaves methotrexate to form the amino acid glutamate and 2,4-diamino-n(10)-methylpteroic acid. catabolites of methotrexate are much less toxic than the parent compound, and are primarily excreted by hepatic mechanisms.  xxxd2209xxx  has been available on a compassionate basis since the 1990s, and a variety of case reports and larger clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this drug in patients ranging in age from infants to the elderly and in a variety of races and ethnic groups.  xxxd2209xxx  should not be administered within 2 hours of  xxxd2462xxx , because this agent is a reduced folate which competes with methotrexate for the enzyme and  xxxd2209xxx  inactivates  xxxd2462xxx . side effects of  xxxd2209xxx  are rare and relatively mild, and include paraesthesia, flushing, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and headache.  xxxd2209xxx  has seen limited use in intrathecal treatment of methotrexate toxicity for which it is also effective. future applications of this enzyme in chemotherapy continue to be an active area of research. xxxd2209xxx ®; antifolate;  xxxd2209xxx ; chemotherapy;  xxxd2209xxx ; methotrexate
