abstract purpose: triﬂuorothymidine (tft) is a ﬂuoropyrimidine that is part of the novel combination
metabolite tas-102, in which tft is combined with a
potent  xxxg2365xxx  inhibitor (tpi). tas102 is currently tested as an orally chemotherapeutic
agent in diﬀerent schedules in a phase i study. in its
monophosphate form, tft can inhibit thymidylate
synthase (ts) activity after binding to the ts-nucleotide binding site leading to dttp depletion, and in its
triphosphate form tft is incorporated into dna,
eventually leading to dna damage. in this in vitro
study, we investigated whether tft could potentiate
cytotoxicity of the antifolate-based ts inhibitors
ag337 (nolatrexed),  xxxd3077xxx  ( xxxd3077xxx ) and
gw1843; and whether increased ts inhibition or dna
damage would be related to this result. methods: the
drug combinations were studied in colon cancer cell
lines either grown at low or high folate conditions.
multiple drug eﬀect analysis was performed after
measuring growth inhibition when the drugs were
combined (mtt assay) and expressed as combination
index (ci), where ci<0.9 indicates synergism,
ci=0.9–1.1 indicates additivity and ci>1.1 indicates
antagonism. drug target analysis was performed using
the ts in situ inhibition assay and the fadu dnadamage assay. cells were exposed to either the drugs
alone or in combination to determine the eﬀect on ts
activity and dna damage induction, respectively. results: three experimental procedures were used to test
the interaction of the drugs: either one of the drugs was

kept at a constant concentration (ic25) or two drugs
were added in a 1:1 ic50-based molar ratio. the combinations of tft with one of the antifolates in which
one of the drugs was kept at a constant concentration
were synergistic for all antifolates in widr/f cells,
which grow in low folate medium (ci=0.6–0.8), but
only additive to antagonistic for the cell lines growing
in high folate medium: tft-ag337: ci=0.9–2.3;
tft- xxxd3077xxx : ci=0.9–1.3; tft-gw1843: ci=0.8–
1.7. the procedure in which the two drugs were added
in a 1:1 ic50-based molar ratio showed antagonism for
all three combinations in all cell lines (ci>2.7). ts
inhibition (14.3%) and dna damage (8%) were more
pronounced than expected (p<0.05) when tft was
combined with gw1843 in widr/f cells, in contrast to
ag337 and  xxxd3077xxx , which showed inhibiting eﬀects as
expected (additive). conclusions: the combination of
tft with the antifolates ag337,  xxxd3077xxx  and
gw1843 is mainly additive when the drugs are given
simultaneously and this is mediated by an additive ts
inhibition and dna damage. the drug interaction may
partly be dependent on the folate homeostasis since
widr/f cells growing at low folate conditions show
pronounced synergism in growth inhibition, two-sided
ts inhibition and dna damage, especially when tft
is combined with the tight-binding ts inhibitor
gw1843.

introduction
in the treatment of colorectal cancer, most chemotherapy regimens used at present consist of combinations
of drugs. often 5-fluorouracil ( xxxd2134xxx ) is combined
with other cytostatic agents to improve the response rates
[1– 3]. in colorectal cancer, the expression of thymidylate

172

synthase (ts) [4] is usually high. ts is a rate-limiting
enzyme in the pyrimidine de novo deoxynucleotide
synthesis and therefore is an excellent target for chemotherapeutic strategies [5, 6]. ts catalyzes the methylation
of 2¢-deoxyuridine-5¢-monophosphate (dump) to 2¢- xxxd3364xxx -5¢-monophosphate ( xxxd3365xxx ), where 5,10methylene-tetrahydrofolate (ch2-thf) serves as the
methyl donor in the reaction [7]. ts can be inhibited by a
variety of cytotoxic agents, which are active against colon cancer in clinical trials [8–11].
besides 5-fluoro-2¢-deoxyuridine-5¢-monophosphate
(fdump), a metabolite derived from  xxxd2134xxx , ts can also
be inhibited by the ﬂuorinated dump analog 5-triﬂuoro-2¢- xxxd3364xxx -5¢-monophosphate (tf-tmp),
the phosphorylated product from triﬂuorothymidine
(tft) [12,13]. tft enters the cell by a nucleoside
transporter, although the contribution of the concentrative and equilibrative nucleoside transporters is not
known. furthermore, tft is part of the novel combination tas-102 [14–16, 30], which is currently tested in
a phase i study as an oral chemotherapeutic regimen
given in diﬀerent schedules [17]. in contrast to fdump,
tf-tmp does not form a stable ternary complex and
binds covalently to the active site of ts [12, 18].
antifolates have been extensively studied as anticancer drugs [19]. antifolates inhibit ts directly by
binding to the ch2-thf binding site of ts, such as
ag337 (nolatrexed or thymitaq) [20, 21],  xxxd3077xxx 
( xxxd3077xxx  or  xxxd3077xxx ) [22] and gw1843 (1843u89)
[23, 24].  xxxd3077xxx  and gw1843 enter the cell via the reduced folate carrier (rfc) [25] and need folylpolyglutamate synthetase ( xxxg814xxx ) to inhibit ts eﬀectively.
ag337 enters the cell by passive diﬀusion and does not
need to be polyglutamated to become more active. antifolates have been studied in combination with  xxxd2134xxx  in
vitro and were shown to be mainly additive when given
simultaneously depending on scheduling [26]. caponigro
et al. [27] summarized that combining  xxxd3077xxx  and  xxxd2134xxx 
resulted in a well-tolerated schedule-dependent synergism in diﬀerent clinical studies.
since tft and antifolates all inhibit ts, we
hypothesized that they might enhance each other in ts
inhibition. inhibition of ts results in depletion of dttp
and an increase in dutp in the cell, the so-called thymine-less state, thereby causing misincorporation of
dutp into dna [28, 29]. in addition, the triphosphate
form of tft (tf-ttp) can also be incorporated into
the dna leading to dna strand breaks [16, 30]. the
imbalance in dttp/dutp and dna damage induction
probably results in an induction of downstream events
leading to cell death [31].
in the present study, we aimed to determine whether
sensitivity of colon cancer cells to antifolates could be
increased by two-sided ts inhibition by addition of
tft. for this purpose, we used several colon cancer cell
lines to investigate the eﬀect of diﬀerent combinations of
tft with the antifolates ag337,  xxxd3077xxx  and gw1843
on inhibition of cellular growth, inhibition of ts and
dna damage induction.

materials and methods
chemicals
tft was synthesized and kindly provided by taiho
pharmaceuticals co. (tokushima, japan). the antifolates ag337,  xxxd3077xxx  and gw1843 were provided by
pﬁzer/agouron pharmaceuticals inc. (la jolla, ca,
usa), astrazeneca pharmaceuticals ltd. (macclesﬁeld,
uk) and glaxosmithkline inc. (research triangle
park, nc, usa), respectively. 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (mtt) was obtained from sigma-aldrich chemicals (zwijndrecht, the
netherlands). [5 3h]-2¢- xxxd1836xxx  (speciﬁc activity
23 ci/mmol) was purchased from moravek biochemicals inc. (brea, ca, usa). all other chemicals were of
analytical grade and commercially available.
cell cultures
three colon cancer cell lines were used for the experiments including h630, widr and colo320 [32, 33].
these cell lines were cultured in dmem medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum
(fcs; gibco brl, breda, the netherlands) and 20 mm
hepes (cambrex bioscience, verviers, belgium). because this mixture contains 8.8 lm  xxxd2146xxx , which may
inﬂuence the antiproliferative eﬀects of tft and antifolates, we used the widr subline widr/f, which was
adapted to grow on low folate conditions [34]. widr/f
was cultured in folate-free rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated and dialyzed fcs,
20 mm hepes, 2 mm glutamine and 2.5 nm dl- xxxd2462xxx  (lv;  xxxd2147xxx ). this did not aﬀect the doubling time. both dmem and rpmi 1640 culture media
were obtained from cambrex bioscience (verviers,
belgium). all four cell lines grew as adherent monolayers in a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5% co2 at
37c and were maintained in exponential growth.

growth inhibition studies
to assess cytotoxicities to tft and the antifolates the
mtt assay was used [35, 36]. in brief, a suspension of
5,000 cells/100 ll of medium was added to each well of
costar ﬂat-bottomed 96-well plates (corning inc., ny,
usa). after 24 h incubation, 100 ll drug containing
medium was added to the wells in diﬀerent concentrations and plates were incubated for another 72 h. subsequently, the medium was removed from the wells and
cells were incubated in 50 ll of mtt solution (end conc.
0.42 mg/ml medium) for 3 h at 37c. the formazan
crystals were dissolved in 150 ll of dmso (merck,
darmstadt, germany) and absorbance was read at
540 nm using spectra fluor (tecan, salzburg, austria).
the ic25 and ic50 growth inhibition values were

173

expressed as the concentrations that corresponded to a
reduction of cellular growth by 25% and 50%, respectively, when compared to values of untreated control
cells.
multiple drug eﬀect analysis
all cell lines were exposed to tft, the antifolates or a
combination of tft with an antifolate (simultaneously). three combination variants were used to test
the interaction of the drugs: (1) combination of various
concentrations of an antifolate with a constant concentration of tft (ic25); (2) combination of various
concentrations of tft with a constant concentration
of an antifolate (ic25) or (3) various concentrations of
the two drugs were added in a ﬁxed 1:1 ic50-based
molar ratio. using the mtt assay dose-eﬀect curves
were generated to obtain the ic25 and ic50 values and
to perform multiple drug eﬀect analysis using calcusyn
software (biosoft, 1996). this program is based on the
method of chou and talalay [37], which is distinct
from other methods by the fact that both ‘potency’ and
‘shape’ of dose-eﬀect curves of drugs and their combinations are taken into account [1]. this method has
been used before in combination studies with anticancer agents [26, 38].
each fraction aﬀected (fa) was calculated by comparing the absorbance values of drug-treated wells to the
absorbance of the control wells. a drug concentration
that induces fa=0.25 means a decrease in absorbance
and growth of 25% (=ic25 concentration). background
absorbance was set at fa=1. the program only allows
using fa values in the range 0.01<fa<0.99. from the
median drug eﬀect plots, the dose that reduced absorbance by 50% (dx) and the slope (m) were calculated.
the data were only applicable to this method of analysis
when the linear correlation coeﬃcient r of each obtained
curve was >0.9. the program uses the formula d11/m
to calculate the doses of the
fa=dx[fa/(1-fa)]
separate drugs and combination required to induce
various levels of cytotoxicity. for each level of cytotoxicity a mutually non-exclusive combination index
(ci) was calculated using the formula: ci=[(d)1/(d1fa)1] + [(d)2/(d1-fa)2] + [a (d)1 (d)2/(d1-fa)1 (d1fa)2]. the parameters (d)1 and (d)2 represent the doses
of the combination of drugs in a ﬁxed ratio, whereas (d1fa)1 and (d1-fa)2 are the doses of the individual drugs
resulting in the eﬀect 1 fa and a=1 for mutually nonexclusive drugs. examples of dose-fa and fa-ci plots
are given in figs. 1 and 2. in this method, according to
the guidelines of the program, a ci<0.9 indicates synergism whereas ci=0.9–1.1 indicates additivity and
ci>1.1 indicates antagonism. a mean ci was calculated from datapoints with fa>0.5 for the combination
variants 1 and 2 and for the combination variant 3 a
mean ci was calculated from the fa values 0.6, 0.75
and 0.9. we considered fa<0.5 as not relevant growth
inhibition [1].

combination of gw1843 with a ﬁxed concentration of tft in
widr/f cells. gw1843 was added at various concentrations
(gw1843v) and tft was kept at a constant ic25-concentration
(tftc). (ﬁlled square)=tftv; (ﬁlled circle)=gw1843v; (ﬁlled
triangle)=gw1843v+tftc. an average ci value was calculated
from datapoints with fa>0.5, in this example ciavg=0.64. see
also materials and methods

ts in situ inhibition assay
inhibition of ts in intact cells was determined by measuring the conversion of [5 3h]-dump to  xxxd3365xxx  and
3
h2o catalyzed by ts, based on a previously described
assay [39], and partly modiﬁed by our group [40].
brieﬂy, 2.5·105 cells/2 ml/well in costar 6-well plates
were incubated for 24 h with or without (controls) the
drugs. [5 3h]-2¢- xxxd1836xxx  (ﬁnal concentration
1 lm) was added 2 h before the end of the incubation
period. blanks containing culture medium were also
included. a 200 ll sample from the culture medium was
taken and the reaction was stopped by addition of trichloroacetic acid (17.5% end concentration). the
unconverted [5 3h]-2¢- xxxd1836xxx  was removed by
precipitation using activated charcoal. after centrifugation, the supernatants were transferred to liquid
scintillation vials and counted for radioactivity. ts
catalytic activity in cellular extracts was also measured
using the tritium release assay [33].
for the combination studies, the concentrations of
tft and antifolates used were based on an expected
inhibition of ts by each drug of 20–50% in order to
evaluate the eﬀects of the combinations. tft was
combined with the diﬀerent antifolates simultaneously
at these concentrations in order to determine whether
inhibition of ts was changed. representative ts

tft and gw1843 were
combined in various
concentrations in a ratio based
on their ic50 values. an average
ci value was calculated from
datapoints with fa=0.6, 0.75
and 0.9, in these examples all
ciavg>3.4 (=antagonism). see
also materials and methods

inhibition curves induced by tft for the colon cancer
cell lines are depicted in fig. 3. fractional eﬀect analysis was performed to predict the eﬀect of two drugs by
multiplying the relative eﬀects of each single drug to
compare it with the observed eﬀect of the combination
at the same concentrations of the single drugs [1]. the
eﬀect of the two drugs are synergistic when measured
value<predicted value, additive when measured value=predicted value and antagonistic when measured
value>predicted value.
fadu dna damage assay
diﬀerences in dna damage between tft, ag337,
 xxxd3077xxx , gw1843 or a combination of tft with one of
the antifolates was determined by the fadu assay
(fluorometric analysis of dna unwinding) [26, 41].
the assay is based on the principle that the unwinding
rate of double stranded dna (dsdna) in an alkaline
environment is related to the extent of dsdna breaks

induced by the drugs (detected with ethidium bromide).
dna with high amount of strand breaks will unwind
faster than dna without strand breaks. dna strand
breaks were measured after 48 h exposure of widr and
widr/f cells to the drugs alone or in combination.
concentrations of the single drugs were chosen that at
least 60% of the dsdna was still double stranded
compared to the controls (the untreated cells). cells were
also exposed to 50 lm etoposide 2 h before harvesting
as a positive control for dna strand break formation.
to predict the eﬀect of a combination of drugs, fractional eﬀect analysis was performed, as described for the
ts in situ inhibition.
statistics
the student’s t-test for paired data was used for statistical analysis of data with two parameters. changes were
considered to be signiﬁcant when p<0.05.

the sensitivities of the cell lines for tft and the antifolates ag337,  xxxd3077xxx  and gw1843 are summarized in
table 1. the ic50 values were also used to calculate the
drug ratios for the ﬁxed ratio combinations. the cell
lines were least sensitive to tft and ag337 (all ic50
values> 450 nm) and most sensitive to  xxxd3077xxx  and
gw1843 (all ic50 values< 25 nm). gw1843 was the
most potent inhibitor of cellular growth (all ic50 values,
2.2 nm or lower). the widr/f cell line growing on low
folate conditions was more sensitive to all drugs compared to its parental cell line widr and also more sensitive to the antifolates compared to the other cell lines.
h630 was most sensitive to tft.
fa values were obtained after exposure of cells to a
series of drug concentrations of tft and/or antifolate,
depending on the combination variant. the combinations of tft with the antifolates were evaluated using

the fa-ci plots (see figs. 1, 2). the mean ci values of
all combination variants are given in table 2. the
combinations of tft with one of the antifolates in
which one of the drugs was kept at a constant concentration was not more than additive and was cell line
dependent (tft-ag337: ci=0.9–2.3; tft- xxxd3077xxx :
ci=0.9–1.3; tft-gw1843: ci=0.8–1.7), except for
widr/f, where all three drug combinations showed
ci=0.6–0.8 and were clearly synergistic. since we previously observed an aberrant binding pattern of
gw1843 to ts [43], we also investigated preincubation
with the antifolate. however, the ci did not change
when widr/f cells were preincubated 24 h with
gw1843 prior to tft exposure. the combination variant in which the two drugs were added in a 1:1 ic50based molar ratio showed antagonism for all drug
combinations in all cell lines (ci>2.7).

curves obtained after exposure of cells to a concentration series of the drugs (see fig. 3). ts is inhibited most
pronounced in widr/f cells and the highest tft concentration to inhibit ts by 50% was required for h630
cells. the eﬀect of each drug on the in situ ts activity in
cells was used to predict the inhibition of the combinations. the expected and observed in situ ts inhibition is
depicted in fig. 4. in most cell lines the eﬀects were
additive, except in h630 cells, where a synergistic eﬀect
was induced for all three combinations (p<0.01).
gw1843 induced more ts inhibition with tft in both
widr (4.3%) and widr/f cells (14.3%; p<0.01) than
expected. in widr/f cells more ts inhibition was also
seen for the combination tft- xxxd3077xxx  (13.7%;
p<0.05) but not ag337 (additive).
dna strand break formation

in situ ts inhibition
to evaluate whether the interaction of the drugs was due
to ts inhibition, we studied the eﬀect of the drugs on in
situ ts inhibition. cells display a 3- to 4-fold diﬀerence
in basal ts levels, but the ts levels were similar in widr
and widr/f cells (table 1). in order to evaluate in situ
ts levels and inhibition, the colon cancer cell lines were
exposed to concentrations inhibiting ts by at least 20%.
these concentrations were based on the ts inhibition

since tft can induce dna damage next to and/or
because of ts inhibition, we evaluated whether this effect was enhanced in the combinations. the fadu
dna damage assay demonstrated that more dna
strand breaks were seen in widr and widr/f cells for
the combinations than for tft alone (p<0.05; fig. 5).
the most pronounced eﬀects were seen for the combinations with gw1843, which were signiﬁcantly better
than expected in widr and widr/f (8%, p= 0.05). for

discussion
in the present study, we demonstrated the folate-status of
cells may be an important determinant in the induction
of a synergistic interaction with an antifolate. widr/f
cells growing in low physiological folate conditions are
more sensitive to two-sided inhibition of ts than widr.
the combinations of tft with the antifolates ag337,
 xxxd3077xxx  or gw1843 are mainly additive for the cell lines
growing in high folate containing medium. the low folate status possibly increases the binding of antifolates to
the ts co-factor binding site, resulting in a synergistic
eﬀect between tft and antifolates. although the antifolates are not all competitive inhibitors of ts, folate
levels in medium and cells are an important determinant
of the eﬃcacy of the antifolates [25, 44], because culture
conditions will reduce folate pools in colon cancer cells
about 10-fold (unpublished data), thereby also reducing
the availability of folates for other folate-requiring processes. this is clearly shown by the more potent ts in situ
inhibition by tft and antifolates in widr/f cells compared to widr cells despite comparable ts levels in the
cells (fig. 3; [45]). therefore it can be concluded that low
intracellular folate levels will enhance the eﬃciency of ts

177

inhibitors, and possibly also the interaction between two
types of ts inhibitors, nucleotide- and folate-directed. a
relative moderate increase to 50 nm lv is already very
eﬀective to abrogate antifolate eﬀects [25], which is the
reason why the experiments were performed at very low
folate levels.
the interaction between tft and antifolates may have
some similarities to  xxxd2134xxx . fdump is a very potent ts
inhibitor with a ki of about 1 nm [46]. our group previously showed that antifolates could enhance fdumpmediated ts inhibition in ts-overexpressing cells when
exposed to  xxxd2134xxx . especially at low antifolate concentrations (<0.3 lm) fdump binding to human ts can be
facilitated, but is dependent on polyglutamate status [43].
we previously showed that ts inhibition by tf-tmp in
cancer cells is rapid [47]. tf-tmp binds covalently to ts
and does not form a stable ternary complex in contrast to
 xxxd2134xxx , which forms a stable fdump-ts-ch2thf complex. thus after removal of tft from medium ts activity
restores more rapidly than after  xxxd2134xxx  removal.
because tft induces dttp depletion we expected to
see an increased ts inhibition in combination with
antifolates resulting in higher cytotoxicity, which might be
related to an increase in tftmp-ts binding. this was
only seen in widr/f cells growing in low folate medium
and most pronounced for the tft-gw1843 combination. when these drugs were added simultaneously, synergistic eﬀects were seen, both on the level of dna
damage induction and inhibition of ts. this was not
shown for gw1843 preincubation, which can be explained by the high aﬃnity of this compound for ts ([48];
ki= 0.09 nm) and its unique way of binding to ts [43,
49]. in contrast to gw1843 and  xxxd3077xxx , ag337 was less
cytotoxic to the colon cancer cell lines. ag337 enters the
cell by passive diﬀusion and does not need polyglutamylation to become more active and therefore migrates easier
out of the cell.  xxxd3077xxx  and gw1843 need polyglutamylation to be retained in the cell and bind to ts more easily.
in addition, longo et al. [50] previously showed that
fdump mediated inhibition of ts can be increased by
 xxxd3077xxx  ([8]; ki=1 nm) when preincubated with the antifolate, eventually leading to higher cytotoxicity.
the combinations in which tft and an antifolate
were added to the medium in a ﬁxed 1:1 ic50-based molar
ratio showed antagonistic eﬀects, even for widr/f cells.
in this combination variant dump levels are likely to be
more increased at high antifolate levels, leading to an
increased competition between dump and tf-tmp for
binding to the substrate-binding site of ts, especially at
fa>0.5. only at low tft and antifolate concentrations
synergism was observed for the 1:1 ratio combinations,
possibly because dump levels would still be very low and
two suboptimal inhibitory levels would add up. at high
concentrations of both drugs, growth inhibition would
be too high for each drug separately. in growth inhibition
experiments with variable ratio, the ratio between antifolate and tft concentrations will decrease, thereby
diminishing the competition between dump and tftmp. furthermore, the cooperativity of the antifolates

in the binding of tf-tmp to ts may be negative at
fa>0.5 concentrations, as previously shown for the
antifolates on fdump-binding to ts. positive cooperation between the drugs was shown at concentrations in
the low micromolar range (expressed as hill coeﬃcients)
[43]. this would favor to combine tft with a low and
constant antifolate concentration, which would induce
synergistic eﬀects, since a similar enhancing eﬀect would
be seen at each tft concentration. these data indicate
that a ﬁxed ratio is not always recommended to study
synergistic eﬀects between drugs properly, especially
when the slopes of the growth inhibition curves are different, indicating diﬀerent kinetics of inducing growth
inhibition. using one drug at a ﬁxed concentration enables to compare the drugs more properly, since the eﬀect
of one drug would be similar while only the eﬀect of the
other drug changes. e.g. tft in the formulation tas102 is given orally several times a day, leading to plasma
concentrations in a small range; ts inhibition (fig. 3)
will be similar as well as dna damage.
alternatively, thymidine nucleotides produced via the
tk salvage pathway might antagonize ts inhibition.
this can be mediated by replenishing the tdr levels
after depletion of nucleotide pools. thymidine is not
added to the culture medium and will not be able to
replenish the thymidine nucleotide pools. although
some thymidine is present in fetal calf serum, this is very
low and will be depleted very rapidly during culturing
[40]. therefore, diﬀerences in thymidine rescue are unlikely to play a role in the synergism in widr/f cells
compared to widr cells.
the eﬀect of ts inhibition may be dependent on folate status when cancer cells are exposed to antifolate
based direct ts inhibitors. maximum additive ts inhibition could be achieved when the antifolates were
combined with tft, but only at low folate conditions;
at normal folate conditions the incorporation of dutp
is likely to be decreased. in contrast, the antitumor
mechanism of tft is primarily incorporation into the
dna resulting in the induction of dna fragmentation
(see also [16, 30]), which was enhanced when tft was
combined with gw1843. this antifolate is currently
known as the liposomal formulation osi-7904l [51].
therefore, we can conclude that the antitumor eﬀects of
this formulation might be potentiated by tas-102. in
addition, tas-102 and the novel multi-targeted drug
alimta ( xxxd2868xxx , ly231514) might be a more
favorable combination. alimta has recently been approved for use in the treatment of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma [52].
