abstract the potential interaction of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with cholinergic receptors may play a significant role in the therapeutic and/or side-effects associated with this class of compound. in the present study, the
capacity of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors to interact with
muscarinic receptors was assessed by their ability to displace both [3h]-oxotremorine-m and [3h]-quinuclinidyl
benzilate binding in rat brain membranes. the [3h]-quinuclinidyl benzilate/[3h]-oxotremorine-m affinity ratios
permitted predictions to be made of either the antagonist
or agonist properties of the different compounds. a series
of compounds, representative of the principal classes of
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, displaced [3h]-oxotremorine-m binding with high-to-moderate potency ( xxxd137xxx >neostigmine=pyridostigmine=tacrine>physostigmine>
 xxxd1968xxx =galanthamine>desoxypeganine) whereas only
 xxxd137xxx  and tacrine displaced [3h]-quinuclinidyl
benzilate binding. inhibitors such as desoxypeganine,
parathion and gramine demonstrated negligible inhibition
of the binding of both radioligands. scatchard plots constructed from the inhibition of [3h]-oxotremorine-m binding in the absence and presence of different inhibitors
showed an unaltered bmax and a reduced affinity constant,
indicative of potential competitive or allosteric mechanisms. the capacity of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors,
with the exception of tacrine and  xxxd137xxx , to displace bound [3h]-oxotremorine-m in preference to [3h]quinuclinidyl benzilate predicts that the former compounds could act as potential agonists at muscarinic receptors. moreover, the rank order for potency in inhibiting
acetylcholinesterase ( xxxd137xxx >neostigmine=physostigmine=tacrine>pyridostigmine= xxxd1968xxx =galanthamine

most effective inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase also displaced [3h]-oxotremorine-m to the greatest extent. the
capacity of these inhibitors to displace [3h]-oxotremorine-m binding preclude their utilisation for the prevention of acetylcholine catabolism in rat brain membranes,
the latter being required to estimate the binding of acetylcholine to [3h]-oxotremorine-m-labelled muscarinic receptors. however, fasciculin-2, a potent peptide inhibitor
of acetylcholinesterase (ic50 24 nm), did prevent catabolism of acetylcholine in rat brain membranes with an atypical inhibition isotherm of [3h]-oxotremorine-m binding,
thus permitting an estimation of the “global affinity” of
acetylcholine (ki 85 nm) for [3h]-oxotremorine-m-labelled muscarinic receptors in rat brain.

introduction
acetylcholinesterase (ache; ec3.1.1.7) inhibitors are
therapeutically important in the treatment of some of the
functional deficits associated with alzheimer’s disease
(brufani et al. 1997; parnetti et al. 1997; benzi and
moretti 1998). however, in addition to the adverse effects
of peripheral  xxxg248xxx  inhibition, the interaction of ache inhibitors with cholinergic receptors may be
implicated in the therapeutic and/or toxic side-effects associated with this class of compound (parnetti et al. 1997;
siddiqui and levey 1999). indeed, several reports have
indicated direct interaction of ache inhibitors, such as
physostigmine, neostigmine and carbamate insecticides,
with nicotinic receptors (shaw et al. 1985; alkondon et al.
1988; pereira et al. 1994; nagata et al. 1997). direct effects of ache inhibitors, in particular organophosphates,
on muscarinic receptors were first reported by volpe et al.
(1985) and have since been described extensively (bakry
et al. 1988; silveira et al. 1990; jett et al. 1991; katz and

430

marquis 1992; ward et al. 1993; van den beukel et al.
1997). the organophosphate paraoxon displaces [3h]-nmethylscopolamine ([3h]-nms) binding in a human
sk-n-sh cell line (katz and marquis 1992) whereas
van den beukel et al. (1997) have indicated that paraoxon
appeared to have agonist-like actions at the muscarinic receptor in the rat cortex. similarly, the organophosphate
chlorpyrifos and its active oxon metabolite, non-competitively displace the selective  xxxg448xxx  agonist [3h]-cismethyldioxolane in the rat striatum and inhibit adenylate
cyclase activity, suggesting agonist-effects at m2 and/or
m4 receptors (huff et al. 1994). furthermore, studies by
ward et al. (1993) on a series of organophosphates have
shown a correlation between ache activity for and the
ability to compete with agonist binding to muscarinic receptors. van den beukel et al. (1997) have shown that an
additional class of ache inhibitors, notably physostigmine, also appear to act as agonists at the muscarinic receptor. this conclusion was based on the capacity to inhibit [3h]-oxotremorine-m ([3h]-oxo-m) binding in preference to that of [3h]-quinuclinidyl benzilate ([3h]-qnb).
additional studies have indicated that several ache inhibitors, including physostigmine and tacrine, appear to
regulate binding to muscarinic receptors allosterically by
acting at a distinct allosteric site on the receptor (lee and
el-fakahany 1991; gnagey and ellis 1996).
in addition to binding studies, functional assays also
have implied interaction of ache inhibitors with muscarinic receptors. indeed, paraoxon inhibits adenylate cyclase in striatal cells (jett et al. 1991) and stimulates phosphatidyl-inositol-4,5-bisphosphate (pip2) hydrolysis in
sk-n-sh cells (katz and marquis 1992). studies by shibata et al. (1996) have shown that several ache inhibitors stimulate the phosphatidylinositol (pi)-response
in airway smooth muscle, an effect antagonised by atropine. the participation of central muscarinic effects in
the cardiovascular effects of neostigmine has also been
demonstrated following its intracerebroventricular administration (taira 1998).
since the endogenous ligand for muscarinic receptors,
acetylcholine (ach), is catabolised rapidly by endogenous membrane-bound ache present in rat brain membrane preparations, inhibitors are often added to prevent
ach catabolism and thus permit estimation of the affinity
of ach for its binding sites. indeed, sharif et al. (1995)
have employed the specific ache inhibitor, physostigmine (100 µm), and obtained an affinity of 10 nm for
[3h]-oxo-m binding for ach. however, to obtain a reliable estimate of the binding of ach to muscarinic receptor(s), the ache inhibitor, at the concentration employed
to inhibit enzyme activity, must not itself interfere with
the binding of the radiolabelled ligand. the results of
sharif et al. (1995) are difficult to interpret, given that
ache inhibitors, including physostigmine and neostigmine, at concentrations sufficient to inhibit ache activity, also displace [3h]-ach or [3h]-oxo-m binding to rat
brain (gurwitz et al. 1985; van den beukel et al. 1997). in
the present study, therefore, we evaluated the effects of a
series of compounds representative of the principal

classes of ache inhibitors (tertiary amino compounds,
carbamates and organophosphates) on the binding of both
[3h]-qnb and [3h]-oxo-m to rat brain membranes. [3h]qnb is a non-selective m1–m5 muscarinic receptor antagonist with a constant affinity for the different subtypes
and labels both high-and low-affinity states. [3h]-oxo-m
is a muscarinic agonist with high affinity binding to primarily m2 and m4 receptors (richards and van giersbergen 1995; van den beuckel et al. 1997) and labels selectively the high-affinity agonist state of the receptor (birdsall et al. 1978, 1980). previous studies have demonstrated that muscarinic receptor antagonists displace both
[3h]-nms and [3h]-oxo-m binding to a similar extent,
whereas muscarinic agonists inhibit [3h]-oxo-m binding
preferentially (freedman et al. 1988; sharif et al. 1995).
thus, the differential affinity ratios (nms/oxo-m) permit
the classification of ligands as muscarinic receptor agonists, partial agonists and antagonists and demonstrate a
close relationship with functional efficacy, as reflected by
pi turnover (freedman et al. 1988). in addition, the potential use of ache inhibitors for the determination of the
global affinity of ach for [3h]-oxo-m-labelled muscarinic receptors in rat brain membranes was assessed.

materials and methods
materials
physostigmine, tacrine, neostigmine, acetylcholine chloride, electric eel ache (type iii), oxotremorine-m,  xxxd137xxx ,  xxxd1968xxx , pyridostigmine, were obtained from sigma/rbi, france.
desoxypeganine, galanthamine, and fasciculin-2 were obtained
from latoxan, france. atropine was from fluka and parathion
from riedel-de haën. rs86 was obtained from servier laboratories. [3h]-qnb (1.89 tbq/mmol) and [3h]-oxo-m (3,174 gbq/
mmol) were obtained from amersham and nen, respectively.
methods
preparation of rat brain membranes
rat brains (iffa-credo, france) were homogenised in krebs buffer
(in mm): 50 tris-hcl, 120 nacl, 5 kcl, 1 mgcl2, 2 cacl2,
ph 7.4 for 20 s at 20,000 rpm with a polytron (pt3000). the preparation was centrifuged (20,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °c) and the
resulting supernatant re-homogenised twice for 20 s at 20,000 rpm
in krebs buffer. after a second centrifugation (20,000 rpm for
10 min at 4 °c), membrane pellets (p2) were stored frozen at
–80 °c. protein concentration was determined with a kit (bca
protein assay reagent kit, pierce).
binding of [3h]-oxo-m and [3h]-qnb to rat brain membranes
binding studies to rat brain p2 membranes were carried out according to a modified procedure of birdsall et al. (1978) and
freedman et al. (1988) for [3h]-oxo-m and of anderson and
arneric (1994) for [3h]-qnb. all experiments were carried out in
96-well plates in a final volume of 500 µl. p2 membrane fractions
(250–500 µg/ml) diluted in 50 mm nah2po4 buffer (ph 7.4) were
incubated with increasing concentrations of [3h]-oxo-m (0.05–
10 nm) or [3h]-qnb (0.025–5 nm) for 2 h at 20 °c. non-specific
binding was defined with 1 µm atropine. displacement of [3h]oxo-m or [3h]-qnb binding by different compounds was determined at radioligand concentrations of 2 and 0.5 nm, respectively.

431
competitive binding curves were established by incubation in the
presence of a concentration range (4 log units) of the ligand under
study (dilution from a stock solution of 10 mm in dmso). the respective radioligands were added (50 µl) and incubated for 2 h at
20 °c. to assess the competitive mechanism of the displacement of
[3h]-oxo-m binding with ache inhibitors, the specific binding of
[3h]-oxo-m (0.05–10nm) was determined in the absence and
presence of a fixed concentration of compound. samples were filtered using a brandel cell harvester (mb48r, 48-well) on fibreglass filters (gelman xe20316) previously soaked (~1 h) in 50 mm
tris-hcl/0.05% polyethylenimine (ph 7.4).
assay of electric eel ache activity
inhibition of electric eel ache (type iii) activity was assessed using a cholinesterase assay kit (sigma/rbi, france). in brief, to a
solution (0.70 ml) of 5.36 mm nacl, ph 7.4, the following were
added successively: 0.5 ml 5.4 mm m-nitrophenol in 10 mm
nah2po4 (ph 7.8), 50 µl ache (3.46 u/ml) and a range of different concentrations (100 µl) of the inhibitor under study. samples
were incubated for 15 min in the dark at 22 °c and the reaction
started by the addition of a freshly prepared solution of ach chloride (250 µmol/ml, 60 µl) in distilled water. samples were incubated for a further 30 min in the dark at 22 °c and assayed for absorbance at 400 nm with a beckman du-640 spectrophotometer.
data analysis
all binding data were analysed using commercially available software (prism, graphpad, san diego, calif., usa). maximum binding (bmax, in femtomoles/milligram protein) and kd (in nanomoles/litre) were determined using both a non-linear (rectangular
hyperbola) regression analysis and linear regression analysis of
scatchard plots. displacement data was fitted to a four-parameter
logistic equation and the goodness of fit tested by a runs test and,
for certain compounds that displayed a runs test value p<0.05
and/or shallow inhibition plots, an f-test was used to compare the
best fit with one- and two-site non-linear regression models. ic50
and hill coefficient (nh) values were determined from the non-linear regression analysis and ki calculated according to the procedure of cheng and prusoff (1973). for each separate experiment,
the result corresponds to the mean of four individual measurements (four wells) and each experiment was repeated 2–4 times.
the significance of differences between control and treated kd and
bmax, as well as between nh values and unity was established by
t-test analysis. p<0.05 was regarded as significant.

was examined for the ability to displace the binding of
[3h]-qnb, only  xxxd137xxx  (ic50 371 nm) and tacrine
(ic50 6,060 nm) inhibited binding to any significant extent (fig. 1a and table 1).
for comparative purposes, the inhibition of electric eel
ache with these different inhibitors was also assessed
(fig. 1b and table 1). under the present experimental conditions fasciculin-2 was the most potent inhibitor of
ache (ic50 24 nm). the potency of the remaining compounds in inhibiting ache was:  xxxd137xxx >neostigmine=physostigmine=tacrine>pyridostigmine= xxxd1968xxx  =galanthamine > desoxypeganine > parathion >
gramine (fig. 1b and table 1). no direct correlation was
observed between ic50 for the inhibition of ache activity
and that for displacing [3h]-oxo-m binding, although
these data suggest a significant relationship in the rank
order of potency.
to determine whether the ability of ache inhibitors to
displace [3h]-oxo-m binding was related to a modification in the binding affinity of [3h]-oxo-m or to a change
in its number of binding sites, these binding parameters
for [3h]-oxo-m were assessed in the absence and presence of the different inhibitors. all of the compounds
tested, at concentrations in the same range as the ic50 values for inhibiting [3h]-oxo-m binding, were representative of the different classes of ache inhibitors and
demonstrated a significant change in the affinity (kd) of
[3h]-oxo-m relative to untreated rat brain membranes,
without a significant change in bmax (fig. 2 and table 2).

fourfold increase in the kd for [3h]-oxo-m binding in the
presence of inhibitor was observed. the potent ache
toxin, fasciculin-2  xxxd2274xxx .5 nm also modified the affinity of
[3h]-oxo-m binding (kd 1.47±0.37 nm) significantly relative to untreated controls (3.7±0.58 nm) without a significant change in bmax (119±19 vs. 148±14 fmol/mg protein, respectively) (fig. 2 and table 2).
effect of ache inhibitors on the binding
of ach to [3h]-oxo-m-labelled muscarinic receptors
estimation of the displacement of [3h]-oxo-m or [3h]qnb binding by ach requires addition of an inhibitor to
prevent ach catabolism by endogenous ache present in
rat brain membranes. estimates of ach affinity with [3h]qnb in the presence of 1 µm physostigmine, yielded an
ic50 of more than 66,000 nm (data not shown). such a result is not unexpected, considering the inability of muscarinic agonists to displace [3h]-qnb binding under the
present experimental conditions and based on previous reports (freedman et al. 1988). for these reasons, the effect
of a series of ache inhibitors (at 1 and 10 µm) on [3h]oxo-m binding in rat brain membranes in the absence and
presence of ach was investigated to identify a potential
ache inhibitor which did not displace [3h]-oxo-m binding. the ache inhibitors  xxxd137xxx , physostigmine,
neostigmine, tacrine, pyridostigmine, galanthamine and
 xxxd1968xxx  inhibited [3h]-oxo-m binding whereas desoxypeganine, parathion, gramine, and fasciculin-2 dem-

onstrated negligible or only moderate inhibition of [3h]oxo-m binding (fig. 3a). ach (10 µm) in the absence of
inhibitor resulted in ~20% inhibition of [3h]-oxo-m binding, whereas inhibition of endogenous membrane-associated ache is evidenced by a complete inhibition of [3h]-

oxo-m binding by ach, plus the contribution from the
respective inhibitor (fig. 3b). the most effective inhibitors of ache ( xxxd137xxx , physostigmine, neostigmine,
tacrine, pyridostigmine, galanthamine,  xxxd1968xxx ) also
interfered with [3h]-oxo-m binding to the greatest extent.
compounds demonstrating only moderate inhibition of
[3h]-oxo-m binding [galanthamine (1 µm),  xxxd1968xxx 
(1 µm), desoxypeganine (10 µm), parathion (10 µm),
gramine (10 µm)] were ineffective in preventing ach catabolism, at these concentrations. however, fasciculin-2
presented a low level of inhibition of [3h]-oxo-m binding
(~30% at 50 ng/ml; 7.5 nm) and completely prevented
ach catabolism (fig. 3b).
in a previous report, a ki of 10 nm was estimated for
ach binding to rat brain membranes with [3h]-oxo-m,
obtained using 100 µm physostigmine to prevent ach catabolism by membrane-bound ache (sharif et al. 1995).
however, in the present study, the inhibition of [3h]-oxo-m
binding in the presence of different concentrations of
physostigmine indicated approximately 70% and 30% inhibition of [3h]-oxo-m binding at 100 and 1 µm, respectively (fig. 4a). furthermore, the inhibition of [3h]-oxo-m
binding in the presence of different concentrations of
physostigmine in presence of 10 µm ach indicated that
concentrations of physostigmine higher than 1 µm were
necessary to prevent catabolism of ach (fig. 4a). consequently, since the cheng and prusoff equation is valid for
a single competitor but not for a combination of inhibitors, it is evident that any intrinsic interference with
[3h]-oxo-m binding, as observed with physostigmine, results in inherent errors in the interpretation of the affinity
of ach for [3h]-oxo-m-labelled muscarinic receptors in
rat brain. parathion demonstrated a concentration-dependent increase in the inhibition of [3h]-oxo-m binding
(maximal inhibition ~60%) between 10–100 µm, whereas
in the presence of ach, concentrations of parathion in excess of 100 µm were necessary to prevent catabolism of
ach (fig. 4b). however, fasciculin-2 (1.4–15 nm) from

[3h]-oxo-m binding in rat brain membranes represented
only 9% of the total number of muscarinic receptors, as
indicated by saturable [3h]-qnb binding, and is consistent with the relative selectivity of [3h]-oxo-m for the m2
and  xxxg450xxx  subtypes (richards and van giersbergen
1995; van den beukel et al. 1997). previous reports (freedman et al. 1988; anderson and arneric 1994) have indi-

436

cated that muscarinic receptor agonists demonstrate potent and differential affinity for [3h]-oxo-m binding with
negligible affinity for either [3h]-nms or [3h]-qnb,
whereas muscarinic antagonists displaced both [3h]-oxo-m
and [3h]-qnb or [3h]-nms to an equivalent extent.
furthermore, the ratio of the affinity constants correlates
with the ability of agonists to stimulate cortical pi turnover and to down-regulate muscarinic receptors in a neuroblastoma-glioma hybrid cell line (freedman et al 1988).
consequently, based on the qnb/oxo-m affinity ratio it
is possible to predict potential antagonist or agonist activities of different compounds for muscarinic receptors.
a series of compounds, representative of the principal
classes of ache inhibitors, displaced [3h]-oxo-m binding with high-to-moderate potency ( xxxd137xxx >neostigmine =pyridostigmine=tacrine>physostigmine> xxxd1968xxx =galanthamine>desoxypeganine>parathion=gramine), whereas only  xxxd137xxx  and tacrine displaced
[3h]-qnb binding. the capacity of ache inhibitors, with
the exception of  xxxd137xxx  and tacrine, to displace
[3h]-oxo-m in preference to [3h]-qnb binding predicts
that the former compounds may act as potential agonists
at muscarinic receptors. indeed, van den beukel et al.
(1997) came to similar conclusions, albeit with a reduced
number of compounds (physostigmine, parathion, paraoxon and phenylsaligenin cyclic phosphate). tertiary
amino and carbamate compounds, including  xxxd137xxx , pyridostigmine, tacrine,  xxxd1968xxx , neostigmine
and physostigmine, displace [3h]-oxo-m binding with
moderate-to-high potency, whereas the organophosphate
parathion and atypical inhibitors, such as galanthamine,
desoxypeganine and gramine, were relatively weak inhibitors of [3h]-oxo-m binding. in agreement with previous studies (van den beukel et al. 1997) parathion also
displaced [3h]-oxo-m binding weakly, however, other
organophosphates, in particular the bioactive oxon-metabolite paraoxon, potently interact with muscarinic receptors (volpe et al. 1985; 1992; jett et al. 1991; ward et al.
1993; huff et al. 1994).
all the ache inhibitors tested in the present study
changed the affinity (kd) of [3h]-oxo-m significantly relative to untreated rat brain membranes, without a significant change in bmax, suggesting a competitive mechanism
for the inhibition of [3h]-oxo-m binding. previous studies have demonstrated that the organophosphate paraoxon
competitively inhibits cis-[3h]-methyldioxalane binding
(jett et al. 1991) to m2 muscarinic receptors in rat brain
striatum. however, allosteric agents can also yield radioligand saturation curves with an unaltered bmax and a reduced kd in the absence and presence of allosteric agents
(stockton et al. 1983). consequently, although scatchard
plots suggested that archetypal compounds from different
classes of ache inhibitors, notably organophosphate
(parathion) or carbamate and tertiary amino compounds,
such as physostigmine, neostigmine, tacrine,  xxxd137xxx 
and  xxxd1968xxx , as well as atypical inhibitors such as
galanthamine, appeared to inhibit [3h]-oxo-m binding to
rat brain membranes in a competitive manner, allosteric
modulation of [3h]-oxo-m binding cannot be excluded.

previous studies have shown that physostigmine and
tacrine can displace [3h]-oxo-m (van den beukel et al
1997) or [3h]-ach binding (gurwitz et al. 1985; gnagey
and ellis 1996) in rat brain and cloned human m2 and m4
receptors; however, it has been demonstrated also that
physostigmine and additional ache inhibitors such as
tacrine appear to act as allosteric modulators for muscarinic receptors at a distinct allosteric site (lee and elfakahany 1991; gnagey and ellis 1996). although further studies will be required to identify competitive or allosteric effects of the additional ache inhibitors tested in
the present study, the possibility that distinct effects
could, in part, relate to differences in the experimental
paradigms, and the molecular structures of human and rat
muscarinic receptors (bonner 1989) cannot be ruled out.
in addition, potter et al. (1989) have demonstrated that
low concentrations of tacrine can displace [3h]oxo-m
binding competitively, whereas higher concentrations are
necessary to inhibit radioligand dissociation via an allosteric site. furthermore, potential differences in the activation state of muscarinic receptor(s) and/or g-proteins
present in rat brain preparations and cho cells could lead
to altered functional properties and drug sensitivities. indeed, van den beukel et al. (1997) have indicated that
ache inhibitors, including physostigmine, were more potent inhibitors (250-fold) of [3h]-oxo-m binding in rat brain
than in cloned human m2 and m4 cho-transfected cells.
in the present study no direct correlation was observed
between the ic50 for displacing [3h]-oxo-m binding and
that for inhibiting ache activity, although the rank order
of potency for the inhibition of electric eel ache ( xxxd137xxx  >neostigmine=physostigmine= tacrine>pyridostigmine= xxxd1968xxx =galanthamine>desoxypeganine>
parathion>gramine) indicated that the most effective inhibitors of ache also displaced [3h]-oxo-m to the greatest extent. a previous study by ward et al. (1993) has indicated a correlation between ache activity for a series
of organophosphates and their ability to compete with agonist binding to muscarinic receptors. in the present study,
specific ache inhibitors displaced [3h]-oxo-m binding
in the same sub-micromolar concentration range necessary to inhibit ache activity. the present results would
appear to indicate that the binding of ache inhibitors to
[3h]-oxo-m-labelled muscarinic receptors could result
from structural and molecular similarities between the agonist or allosteric binding site of these receptors and the
substrate or peripheral binding site of ache. however, although all classes of ache inhibitors were, at some stage,
capable of displacing [3h]-oxo-m binding, on the other
hand oxotremorine-m up to concentrations of 100 µm
failed to inhibit ache activity (data not shown), thus ruling out any potential interaction of [3h]-oxo-m with
ache. in addition, inhibition of [3h]-oxo-m binding with
ache inhibitors was not a result of increased levels of
ach by inhibition of ache activity since the elimination
of endogenous ach in p2 membranes by successive
washing and freeze-thaw cycles did not alter the affinity
of [3h]-oxo-m compared with normal p2 preparations
(data not shown).

the present study does not permit any definitive conclusions regarding a muscarinic receptor subtype-specific
effect of the ache inhibitors tested. nevertheless, considering that high-affinity binding of [3h]-oxo-m occurs primarily to m2 and m4 receptors with almost equal affinity
(richards and van giersbergen 1995; van den beukel et
al. 1997) and that all muscarinic receptor subtypes have
been detected in rat brain (caulfield and birdsall 1998) it
is likely that at the concentrations of [3h]-oxo-m employed in the present study, [3h]-oxo-m binding represents primarily m2 and m4 muscarinic receptor subtypes,
whereas [3h]-qnb labels all m1–m5 receptors with almost equivalent affinity. the maximal inhibition of [3h]oxo-m binding with physostigmine (~70%), neostigmine
(~75%) and fasciculin-2 (~30%) is consistent with previous results obtained with physostigmine (van den beukel
et al. 1997) and different organophosphates (bakry et al.
1988; jett et al. 1991; huff et al. 1994; ward et al. 1993;
van den beuckel et al. 1997). the inability to displace radioligand binding completely, i.e. to the level of non-specific binding, particularly at high concentrations of radioligand, might indicate allosteric modulation of radioligand binding (stockton et al. 1983). on the other hand,
 xxxd1968xxx  and pyridostigmine displaced [3h]-oxo-m
binding incompletely, whilst tacrine and  xxxd137xxx 
completely displaced both [3h]-oxo-m and [3h]-qnb
binding, indicating potentially different mechanisms of
these compounds for displacing [3h]-oxo-m binding.
fasciculin-2, a 6.5-kda peptide purified from the eastern green mamba dendroaspis augusticeps, is a potent,
reversible blocker of the peripheral anionic binding site of
ache (harel et al. 1995). furthermore, previous studies
have shown that mtalpha toxins from the venom of eastern
green and black mamba snakes, which share sequence homology with fasciculins, also bind with high affinity to
muscarinic receptors based on [3h]-qnb binding (jolkkonen et al. 1995; jerusalinsky et al. 1995). a previous
study has demonstrated that fasciculin does not inhibit the
binding of either [3h]-qnb or [3h]-nms in rat cortex
membranes (jerusalinsky et al. 1995). similarly, in the
present study, fasciculin-2 did not displace [3h]-qnb
binding at concentrations below 1 µm, although the atypical displacement of [3h]-oxo-m binding (30% max inhibition, with a steep inhibition curve) seen in the scatchard
plots in the absence and presence of fasciculin-2 could indicate an allosteric effect on [3h]-oxo-m-binding, rather
than a simple competitive mechanism. the mtx toxins
from dendroapsis act with relative selectivity as agonists
at muscarinic m1 receptors (jerusalinsky et al. 1995), although mechanism(s) implicating specific effects on the
different „affinity states“ of the muscarinic receptor with
fasciculin-2 cannot be excluded.
fasciculin-2, in comparison with the other classes of
ache inhibitors permitted an estimation of the affinity of
ach at [3h]-oxo-m-labelled sites (85 nm), compared
with an estimated ki of 36,050 nm [ic50 66.08 µm
(38.6–113.1) n=4] obtained with [3h]-qnb (data not
shown) and results in an estimated qnb/oxo-m affinity
ratio of 424, a value concordant with full agonist activity.

the lack of activity of muscarinic agonists in displacing
[3h]-nms, combined with the marked interference of
[3h]-oxo-m binding with physostigmine, raises questions
regarding the ki of ach for [3h]-nms (120 nm) and
[3h]-oxo-m (10 nm) presented by sharif et al. (1995)
that yield an affinity ratio (12) more representative of an
antagonist at muscarinic receptors. a previous study
(gnagey and ellis 1996) has yielded a kd of 1.2nm for
[3h]-ach binding to cho cells transfected with the human m2 muscarinic receptor subtype. the differences in
the observed affinity constants for ach are probably a direct result of differences in the experimental paradigms,
namely, the heterogeneous population of muscarinic receptors subtypes in rat brain compared to  xxxg448xxx  transfected
cho cells, the molecular structures of human and rat
muscarinic receptors (bonner et al. 1989) and the proportion of receptors in high affinity states and the subtype selectivity of [3h]-oxo-m compared to [3h]-ach. however, in support of our estimated ki of 82 nm for ach
binding to rat brain membranes with [3h]-oxo-m in the
presence of fasciculin-2, previous studies have obtained
kd values of 30–73 nm for [3h]-ach binding to muscarinic receptors in different rat brain structures (kellar et
al. 1985; gurwitz et al. 1985).
the minimal interference of fasciculin-2 with [3h]oxo-m binding, compared with classical ache inhibitors, combined with its efficacy in inhibiting ache activity, permits rapid evaluation of the specific binding of
ach to [3h]-oxo-m-labelled muscarinic receptors in rat
brain membranes. the addition of fasciculin-2 to membrane preparations is thus alternative to the pre-incubation
of membranes with highly toxic irreversible esterase inhibitors such as diiosopropylfluorophosphate followed by
extensive washing prior to assay. more importantly, the
direct interaction of the different classes of ache inhibitors with muscarinic receptors may contribute partly
to the therapeutic and/or side effects associated with prolonged exposure to this class of compound and indicates
the necessity for evaluating potential muscarinic effects of
ache inhibitors with [3h]-oxo-m in particular, as well as
[3h]-qnb binding assays.
