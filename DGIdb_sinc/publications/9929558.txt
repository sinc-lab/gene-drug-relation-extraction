expression of early hippocampal ca1 ltp does not lead to changes
in ampa-epsc kinetics or sensitivity to  xxxd1783xxx 
received: 19 may 1998 / accepted: 3 september 1998

abstract we have analysed whether the expression of
long-term potentiation (ltp) in rat hippocampal ca1
neurons involves a change in the kinetics of (s)-alpha-amino3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (ampa)
receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (epscs) (ampa-epscs) or their susceptibility to the ampa
receptor modulator  xxxd1783xxx . ampa-epscs in the
ca1 region were evoked by alternate stimulation of two
independent schaffer collateral-commissural inputs of
slices of adult rat hippocampus. in the current-clamp
mode a strong tetanus (100 hz, 1 s) applied to one input
(input i) induced stable ltp of ampa-epscs in this input, while the control input (input ii) remained unaffected. for neither input were epsc rise time and decay kinetics significantly changed. the application of  xxxd1783xxx  prolonged the rise time and the decay time constants of the ampa-epscs in both control and potentiated inputs to the same extent (input i–rise time: 198±8%,
decay: 148±12%; input ii–rise time: 212±14%, decay:
144±19%; n=8). furthermore, when present during tetanization  xxxd1783xxx  did not occlude ltp, suggesting
that  xxxd1783xxx  and tetanic stimulation enhance ampaepscs via independent mechanisms. our findings argue
against changes in (de-)activation or desensitization of
ampa receptors as the molecular basis for the expression of ltp.

introduction
long-term potentiation (ltp) in the ca1 region of the
hippocampus, a phenomenon widely assumed to be a correlate for learning and memory, involves an increase in
the amplitude of ampa [(s)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid] receptor-mediated synaptic
responses [11]. this potentiation is probably caused by an
increase in the postsynaptic responsiveness of ca1 neurons [14, 23]. this postsynaptic modification probably reflects an increase in receptor number and/or a modulation
of receptor properties. modulatory changes in the properties of ampa receptors, depending on their nature, could
result in a change in the kinetics of synaptic responses.
indeed, it has been reported that ltp induces alterations
in the time course of synaptic field potential responses
[2], which may reflect changes in the kinetic properties of
the ampa receptors mediating the postsynaptic current
response. possible mechanisms underlying such a change
in kinetic properties include the phosphorylation of
ampa receptors [8, 36] as well as a change in the molecular composition of synaptic ampa receptors [7, 29].
there is evidence that processes which affect ampa
receptor gating kinetics, and thereby alter desensitization
and/or deactivation, may be one mechanism for increased
 xxxg981xxx  responses underlying the expression of
ltp [1]. collectively, these results suggest that an alteration in  xxxg981xxx  channel kinetics could underly the
expression of ltp. indeed, evidence both for [35] and
against [20] such a mechanism has been provided using
 xxxd181xxx , an agent which enhances ampa receptormediated responses. however, the effects of  xxxd181xxx 
are likely to be mediated through multiple effects on different biological systems (for review see [16]).
the benzothiadiazine  xxxd1783xxx  is another positive
 xxxg981xxx  modulator, the actions of which have

192

meanwhile been extensively investigated [26, 27].  xxxd1783xxx  greatly potentiates  xxxg981xxx -induced currents by substantially reducing desensitization and prolongs the decay of ampa-epscs (excitatory postsynaptic currents) by slowing receptor deactivation [26, 27,
28, 37]. these profound effects on  xxxg981xxx -mediated epscs make  xxxd1783xxx  an ideal agent to establish whether the expression of ltp involves alterations
in  xxxg981xxx  kinetics (deactivation and/or desensitization).
in this study we have analysed whether expression of
ltp involves changes in the kinetics of ampa receptormediated epscs and we have compared the effects of
 xxxd1783xxx  on potentiated and non-potentiated synapses in the rat hippocampus. the findings in this study argue against a change in (de-)activation and/or desensitization of ampa receptors as possible mechanisms for
ltp expression.

materials and methods
transverse hippocampal slices (400 µm thick) were obtained from
male wistar rats (140–200 g) which were anaesthetized with ether
before decapitation. the brain was removed rapidly and slices
were prepared in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (acsf) using a campden vibroslicer. all slices were placed in a holding
chamber for at least 90 min before being transferred to an immersion chamber for recordings. the flow rate of the acsf through
the recording chamber was 1.5 ml/min. the composition of the
acsf was (in mm): nacl 124, kcl 3, nahco3 26, cacl2 2,
 xxxd2534xxx  1, d-glucose 10, nah2po4 1.25, bubbled with a 95%
o2/5% co2 and had a final ph of 7.3.
patch-clamp recordings were made from pyramidal neurons
in the stratum pyramidale of area ca1. the mean input resistance of the cells was 213±34 momega, (n=20). glass electrodes
(4.5–5 momega) contained (mm): csch4so3 130, egta 0.05,
hepes 5, mgcl2 1, nacl 1, lidocaine n-ethyl bromide (qx314) 5. ph was 7.3, adjusted with koh. currents were recorded
with a switched voltage-clamp amplifier/sec 1l (npi electronic; tamm/germany) using the “blind” whole-cell recording technique [10]. switching frequencies of 20–25 khz (25% duty cycle) were used. series resistance was monitored continuously
and frequently compensated in bridge mode (for details see
[34]). synaptic currents were generated by test square pulse
stimuli (0.033 hz, 20 µs) delivered via bipolar tungsten electrodes insulated to the tip (50 µm tip diameter) and positioned in
the schaffer collateral-commissural pathway (sccp) with two independent inputs converging onto the same cell. in all experiments, the tetanic stimulus pattern to induce ltp was 100 hz,
for 1 s, at control amplitude. the tetanus was delivered in the
current-clamp mode. to obtain pure  xxxg981xxx -mediated
epscs without blocking n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptors pharmacologically, neurons were held at a membrane potential of –90 mv in the continuous presence of mg2+ (1 mm). in
addition slices were perfused with  xxxd2947xxx  (50 µm) and 3amino-propyl (diethoxymethyl)-phosphonic acid (cgp 35348,
200 µm, ciba geigy) to block gamma- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba)a
and gabab receptors, respectively. voltage-activated sodium
and potassium channels were blocked intracellularly by qx-314
and cs+. all experiments were performed at room temperature.
epscs were first amplified and filtered (2 khz) and then digitized (10 khz) using a laboratory interface (itc-16 computer
interface, instrutech). digitized current responses were stored to
disk on a macintosh quadra 700 computer with the acquisition
program pulse v. 7.21 (heka electronic, lambrecht, germany).
single ampa-epscs were well fitted by single exponential func-

tions to obtain the time constants of decay kinetics. onset rise
time was calculated between 20 and 80% of the peak amplitude.
data are expressed as means ± standard error of means (sem).
the following pharmacological compounds (with sources)
were used: all salts and  xxxd2947xxx  (sigma), qx-314 and d- xxxd1353xxx 
[d(–)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, rbi], cgp 35348.
 xxxd1783xxx  (3-bicyclo[2.2.1] hept-5-en-2-yl-6-chloro-3,4-dihydro-2h-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-7-solvonomide-1,1-dioxide) was a
kind gift from dr. leander, ely lilly, usa. stock solutions of  xxxd1783xxx  (50 mm) were made in distilled water at ph ≥13. after
addition to acsf ph was readjusted to 7.3.

results
ltp expression is not associated
with a detectable alteration of ampa-epsc kinetics
we first examined whether the expression of ltp is associated with an alteration in the onset and/or offset kinetics
of synaptic responses mediated by ampa receptors.
whole-cell-patch clamp experiments were performed using hippocampal ca1 neurons of young rats, and epscs
were recorded following extracellular electrical stimulation of two independent schaffer collateral inputs. to analyse the kinetics of pure ampa-epscs, gabaa and
gabab synaptic components were eliminated with  xxxd2947xxx  (50 µm) and cgp 35348 (200 µm), respectively.
since the activation of nmda receptors is required for
the induction of ltp, nmda receptors could not be
blocked pharmacologically. instead, neurons were held at
a membrane potential of –90 mv in the presence of mg2+
(1 mm) to prevent activation of nmda receptors during
low-frequency stimulation. figure 1 demonstrates that at
a holding potential of –90 mv, currents through nmda
receptor channels did not contribute to the epscs (five
out of five cells). under these experimental conditions
epscs were almost completely suppressed by gyki 1-

during expression of early long-term potentiation (ltp). a neurons were held at a membrane potential of –90 mv (in the presence of 1 mm mg2+) and synaptic responses were evoked in two
independent inputs (ltp input i: filled circles; control input ii:
open circles). inhibitory synaptic components were blocked with
 xxxd2947xxx  (50 µm) and cgp 35348 (200 µm). at the time of the
arrowhead a tetanus (100 hz, 1 s) was delivered to input i in current-clamp mode. this induced stable ltp of ampa-epscs in input i, but not in input ii (a). the decay time constant (b) and rise
time (c) of ampa-epscs remained constant in either input. thirty minutes after induction of ltp in input i,  xxxd1783xxx  (100 µm)
was applied for 40 min as indicated by the bar. the amplitude of
both inputs (a) was increased to a similar extent (control pathway
from 108±7% to 168±11% and ltp pathway from 161±7% to
213±12%; n=12).  xxxd1783xxx  increased the decay time constant
of the control epscs to 197±18%, and in the potentiated pathway
to 220±22% of control (b).  xxxd1783xxx  increased the onset rise
time of the control epscs to 130±7% and of the potentiated pathway to 134±13% of control (c). each data point was obtained

n=7), indicating that they are mediated exclusively by
ampa receptors (fig. 1ba, bb) [27, 28].
to compare the kinetics of potentiated and control
ampa-epscs, we took advantage of the input speci-

ficity of ltp. ltp was generated in one input, whereas
the ampa-epscs evoked in a second input were used
as control responses. after establishing stable postsynaptic current responses in both inputs for 15 min, tetanization (100 hz for 1 s) in one input (input i) resulted
in a long-lasting enhancement of synaptic transmission
in this input (161±7% of control after 35 min; mean ±
sem, n=10) without potentiation of the second input
(input ii) (fig. 2aa, ba). the potentiated synaptic responses showed no difference in onset and offset kinetics compared to baseline responses (figs. 2, 3). likewise, no alteration of ampa-epsc kinetics occurred in
input ii before and after ltp expression in input i, indicating that no change in recording conditions occurred
(fig. 2). the control ampa-epscs had a rise time
(20–80%) of 8.0±0.7 ms and a decay time constant of
25.8±1.3 ms (mean value of 12 cells), which is considerably longer than that obtained from dendritic recordings from the same cell type [9]. this difference is probably caused by dendritic filtering of the synaptic current
response [25]. because dendritic filtering could obscur
small changes in epsc kinetics we also used a pharmacological approach to address this issue.
 xxxd1783xxx  and ltp enhance ampa-epscs
via independent mechanisms
we next tested in the same 12 cells if  xxxd1783xxx  exerts differential effects on non-potentiated versus potentiated synapses. after 30 min of stable ltp in input i, the
application of  xxxd1783xxx  resulted in similar effects on
both pathways. after 20 min,  xxxd1783xxx  (100 µm) increased the amplitudes of the epscs in the control pathway from 108±7% to 168±11%. in the pathway expressing ltp  xxxd1783xxx  increased the epsc amplitudes
from 161±7% to 213±12% (fig. 2aa, 2ba, p>0.26,

in which  xxxd1783xxx  was present during tetanization (open circles). no significant differences in the extent of synaptic potentiation were observed between the two groups (control: 146±7%,  xxxd1783xxx : 146±11%; n=7, data taken from the time interval between 25 and 30 min after tetanization). the arrow indicates the
time of tetanic stimulation. each data point represents the average
amplitude of 2 consecutive epscs normalized to the average epsc
amplitude before tetanization

difference in the effect of  xxxd1783xxx  on ampa-epsc
rise times (20–80%) and decay time constants in control
and potentiated inputs (p>0.69 and p>0.55, respectively,
n=12).  xxxd1783xxx  increased the rise time and the decay time constant of control epscs to 130±7% and 197
±18%, and potentiated to 134±13% and 220±22% of control, respectively (n=12; figs. 2bb, 3). figure 3 shows

in a separate group of experiments we tested whether enhancing ampa-epscs with cyclothiazides occludes ltp.
we alternated control experiments with those using  xxxd1783xxx . ampa-epscs were evoked by stimulating
the schaffer collateral pathway in one input. since the
probability of inducing ltp in the whole-cell mode decreases with the duration of whole-cell recording, ltp
was induced by tetanization at the same time (30–35 min
after obtaining whole-cell access) in all experiments. to
ensure a steady-state effect of  xxxd1783xxx , it was applied (together with  xxxd2947xxx  and cgp 35348) immediately after gaining whole-cell access. in both groups,
in two out of seven experiments, tetanizing only induced
short-term potentiation (stp) lasting for about 15 min
but ltp in the other slices. when all experiments were
averaged, the extent of synaptic potentiation was the same
in control experiments and in those in which  xxxd1783xxx 
was present (control: 146±7%,  xxxd1783xxx : 146±11;
n=7; fig. 4).

discussion
our results provide insights into the role of ampa receptors in the expression of the early phase of ltp. a
change in  xxxg981xxx  kinetics may be a molecular
basis for the expression of ltp. this is based on the observation that the decay time of synaptic responses is re-

195

duced after the induction of ltp [2] (but see also [5,
20]). it is well established that protein phosphorylation is
essential for the expression of the early phase of ltp
(1–3 h; for review see [19]). furthermore, there is evidence that  xxxg981xxx  phosphorylation is an important mechanism that contributes to the potentiation of
synaptic transmission [8, 36]. two studies have provided
evidence that phosphorylation of ampa receptors enhances synaptic responses in a manner suggesting a
change in channel gating kinetics [17, 36]. our data, however, show that expression of ltp is not accompanied by
a change in ampa-epsc kinetics. it is still not entirely
clear what determines the decay of the ampa-epsc in
ca1 hippocampal cells. there is evidence for both presynaptic and postsynaptic processes determining the decay of the ampa-epsc. several authors have proposed
that the decay of the ampa-epsc mainly reflects deactivation and hence the off-rate and affinity of l-glutamate [22, 26], but there is also good evidence suggesting
that it is primarily determined by asynchronous transmitter release [15]. our results would therefore argue against
both a change in the affinity of the  xxxg981xxx  for
l-glutamate and synchronization of transmitter release
as the molecular basis of ltp expression.
other evidence for an involvement of changes in
 xxxg981xxx  kinetics in ltp expression came from
experiments with the nootropic agent  xxxd181xxx . lynch’s
group has reported that this drug has different effects on
the amplitude and waveform of potentiated versus nonpotentiated responses [31]. other studies, however, detected no interaction between  xxxd181xxx -induced changes of the waveform of synaptic events and ltp [6, 20].
furthermore, the modification of field potential responses described by ambros-ingerson et al. [2] could be explained by effects of spike activity rather than by changes in the synaptic response itself [5].
different effects of  xxxg981xxx  modulators on
potentiated versus non-potentiated synapses could, among
other things, reflect changes in the composition of ampa
receptors. the differential assembly of subunits from the
ampa subset, designated as  xxxg952xxx –4 [18], and the alternative splicing of these subunits in the so-called flip
and flop splice variants [30] are well-known regulatory
mechanisms of ampa-receptor function. patch-clamp
studies of recombinant receptors support the idea that
differential subunit composition and/or splicing may explain the significant differences in  xxxg981xxx  desensitization and deactivation kinetics observed with native
ampa receptors from various regions of the cns [25,
29]. these differently composed ampa receptors do not
only differ in their kinetics, but are also differently affected by  xxxd1783xxx  [21, 25]. changes in receptor
composition could theoretically be involved in the early
expression of ltp given that ampa receptors may be
rapidly recycled to and from the synaptic membrane [25a].
however, our results with this drug show that potentiated
and non-potentiated synapses are equally affected by  xxxd1783xxx  and therefore, together with the lack of change
in kinetic properties argue against changes in subunit com-

position of ampa receptors during expression of early
ltp. however, they do not exclude that such changes do
occur during the expression of protein-synthesis-dependent late ltp, which is far beyond the usual duration and
reliability of whole-cell recordings from the hippocampus.
a previous study with  xxxd181xxx  [35] (but see [20])
raised the possibility that similar mechanisms may underlie the potentiation of ampa-epscs by nootropic
agents such as  xxxd1783xxx  and by expression of ltp.
in this case one would expect that previous induction of
ltp would reduce the effect of subsequent application of
 xxxd1783xxx  on epscs and vice versa. neither protocol,
however, reduced the potentiation of ampa-epscs significantly, suggesting that potentiation of ampa-epscs
by  xxxd1783xxx  and that by ltp expression do not share
common mechanisms.
one would expect that the observed prolongation of
ampa-epscs should facilitate the depolarization-induced
removal of the mg2+ block and thereby facilitate ltp induction. idra 21, 1-bcp and bdp derivatives have been
reported to mediate their facilitatory effects on ltp and
learning through inhibition of  xxxg981xxx  desensitization ([3, 4, 32, 33], but see [13]). however, the effects
of these drugs on other parameters, such as deactivation
kinetics, glutamate release and nmda receptors, are not
well understood and it is still a matter of discussion whether the facilitation of ltp seen with these compounds is
caused by modulation of  xxxg981xxx  kinetics. likewise the observation that  xxxd1783xxx  does not induce
ltp facilitation may be explained by an antagonizing effect of  xxxd1783xxx  on nmda receptors [15], which may
compensate the positive modulation of ampa receptors
during ltp induction. alternatively, the conditions used
in the present experiments may leed to sufficient depolarization in the absence of  xxxd1783xxx  for maximum ltp.
these results do therefore not preclude the possibility that
 xxxd1783xxx  can facilitate ltp induced by different protocols.
in summary, our results indicate that changes in the
(de-)activation or desensitization behavior of ampa receptors are not relevant for the expression of ltp. alternatively, the observed increase in ampa-receptor-mediated postsynaptic current responses could be caused by a
presynaptic alteration in transmitter release probability
[12], or a postsynaptic change in  xxxg981xxx  properties such as an increase in the open probability or conductance of the channels [8, 9]. our observations are
also in line with recent findings which support the hypothesis that activation of former non-phosphorylated
and non-functional (“silent”) receptor channels [5, 24] is
an important mechanism for the expression of ltp.
