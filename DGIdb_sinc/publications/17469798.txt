abstract: 5- xxxd148xxx  synthase (alas), the first enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway in
mammalian cells, is a member of the r-oxoamine synthase family of pyridoxal 5‚Ä≤-phosphate (plp)dependent enzymes. in all structures of the enzymes of the r-oxoamine synthase family, a conserved
histidine hydrogen bonds with the phenolic oxygen of the plp cofactor and may be significant for substrate
binding, plp positioning, and maintenance of the pka of the imine nitrogen. in alas, replacing the
equivalent histidine, h282, with alanine reduces the catalytic efficiency for glycine 450-fold and decreases
the slow phase rate for glycine binding by 85%. the distribution of the absorbing 420 and 330 nm species
was altered with an a420/a330 ratio increased from 0.45 to 1.05. this shift in species distribution was
mirrored in the cofactor fluorescence and 300-500 nm circular dichroic spectra and likely reflects variation
in the tautomer distribution of the holoenzyme. the 300-500 nm circular dichroism spectra of alas
and h282a diverged in the presence of either glycine or  xxxd148xxx , indicating that the reorientation
of the plp cofactor upon external aldimine formation is impeded in h282a. alterations were also observed
value and spectroscopic and kinetic properties, while the kplp
increased 9-fold. altogether,

the results imply that h282 coordinates the movement of the pyridine ring with the reorganization of the
active site hydrogen bond network and acts as a hydrogen bond donor to the phenolic oxygen to maintain
the protonated schiff base and enhance the electron sink function of the plp cofactor.

heme is an essential tetrapyrrole in nearly all living cells,
and all tetrapyrroles are biosynthesized from the same
precursor,  xxxd148xxx  (ala).1 in mammals,
5- xxxd148xxx  synthase (alas,  xxxg122xxx ) catalyzes
the condensation of glycine and succinyl-coa to form ala,
coa, and carbon dioxide, in the first and regulatory step of
heme biosynthesis. mammals express genetically distinct
erythroid and housekeeping alas isoforms, and mutations
in the erythroid specific alas have been implicated in
x-linked sideroblastic anemia, a disease characterized by
inadequate formation of heme and the accumulation of iron
in the erythroblast mitochondria (1).
alas belongs to a catalytically versatile class of enzymes
that require pyridoxal 5‚Ä≤-phosphate (plp) as a cofactor (2).

plp-dependent enzymes that catalyze reactions involving
amino acids share common mechanistic characteristics based
on utilization of the electron withdrawing properties of the
cofactor in labilizing bonds to the substrate r-carbon (3).
specifically, the plp cofactor covalently binds to the -amino
group of an active site lysine via a schiff base linkage to
form the ‚Äúinternal aldimine‚Äù. the incoming amino acid
substrate replaces the lysine amino group to form an ‚Äúexternal
aldimine‚Äù via a gem-diamine intermediate, in a reaction often
called transaldimination. subsequently, the cleavage of one
of the substrate r-carbon bonds leads to a resonancestabilized quinonoid intermediate in which the coenzyme acts
as an electron sink, storing electrons from the cleaved bond
through the conjugated system of the schiff base and
pyridinium ring. ultimately, the electrons are dispensed back
for the formation of new linkages to the cr atoms (3).
plp-dependent enzymes have been classified according
to reaction specificity relative to the cr atoms (4) and fold
types derived from three-dimensional structures (5, 6). alas
is classified as a member of the r-oxoamine synthase
subfamily within class ii of fold type i of plp-dependent
enzyme superfamilies (7). in all known structures of fold
type i, the pyridine ring of the plp cofactor superimposes
very well (8). the pyridoxal moiety interacts with the enzyme
in a common motif, which includes the previously mentioned
schiff base linkage with an active site lysine, a salt bridge
between the pyridinium ring nitrogen and an aspartate, and
a hydrogen bond with the phenolic oxygen which occurs
through a variety of amino acids (8).

of  xxxd1739xxx  and the formation r-amino-beta-ketoadipate (v),
decarboxylation of the r-amino-beta-ketoadipate (vi), the
protonation of the second quinonoid intermediate (vii), and
finally the releases of ala (viii) (17,18). to characterize
the role of the conserved histidine in murine erythroid alas
function, a series of h282 variants were constructed. the
results provide evidence that h282 impacts a variety of
alas functions, including substrate and plp binding and
catalysis.
experimental procedures

figure 1: spatial position of active site residues in the r.
capsulatus alas holoenzyme crystal structure. this view highlights the interaction of the pyridinium ring of the cofactor with
active site residues and the h282 imidazole n2 and ndelta1 hydrogen
bonds between the cofactor phenolic oxygen and y121. the image
was constructed using pymol (31) and pdb entry 2bwn. residue
numbering is relative to murine erythroid alas.

in alas and other r-oxoamine synthase enzymes, the
hydrogen bond of the phenolic oxygen involves a conserved
histidine (9-11), which corresponds to h282 in murine
erythroid alas (figure 1). no studies have examined the
role of this residue in any r-oxoamine synthase family
member, although on the basis of structural data alone, it
has been suggested that it may function as an acid catalyst
during transaldimination (12, 13), play a key role in
positioning the plp aromatic ring (11), or influence the pka
of the imine nitrogen (13).
studies of other r-family enzymes indicate that the
significance of interaction between the protein and the
phenolic oxygen of plp may vary according to the requirements of the enzyme. in aspartate aminotransferase and
1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase, the phenolic
oxygen interacts with a tyrosine residue (14, 15). the deletion
of the hydrogen bond via the replacement of the active site
tyrosine with phenylalanine reveals a different function in
the kinetic properties of each enzyme. in aspartate aminotransferase, the tyrosine stabilizes the reactive form of the
internal aldimine at physiological ph and increases the kcat
value (14, 15). similar studies of 1-aminocyclopropane-1carboxylate synthase reveal that the tyrosine decreases the
km but has no effect on kcat (15).
in murine erythroid alas, h282 is tethered between plp
and y121 through hydrogen bonds between the imidazole
n2 and ndelta1 atoms, respectively (figure 1). previous studies
have demonstrated that the h-bond between the y121
hydroxyl group and h282 ndelta1 is important for efficient
cofactor and substrate binding (16), providing evidence of a
probable role for h282 in these interactions. the ordered
alas catalytic pathway is comprised of the following steps
(scheme 1): the association of glycine with the enzyme
forming the michaelis complex (i), the transaldimination
reaction between glycine and the active site lysine (k313)
to generate the external aldimine (ii), the removal of the
pro-r proton to generate a transient quinonoid intermediate

columns were from amersham biosciences. the chameleon
mutagenesis kit was from stratagene. xhoi and xbai
restriction enzymes were from new england biolabs.
methods
mutagenesis. the pgf23 plasmid encoded the full-length
sequence for the murine, mature erythroid alas. sitedirected mutagenesis for the h282y and h282f mouse
alas mutant was performed on the single-stranded pgf23
vector using the chameleon mutagenesis kit from stratagene.
the mutagenic oligonucleotides for h282y and h282f were
gat gaa gtc tat gct tat gct gta gga ctg
tat gga and gat gaa gtc ttt gct tat gct gta
gga ctg tat gga, respectively, with the introduced
codon substitutions underlined. the h282a mutant was
generated using the method previously described by gong
et al. (24). briefly, two rounds of pcr were performed to
produce dna fragments with the desired mutation flanked
by unique restriction sites. the mutagenic primers used to
generate the h282a mutation were 5‚Ä≤-gta gat gaa gtc
gct gct gta gga ctg or 5‚Ä≤-gag tcc tac agc
agc gac ttc atc tac with the introduced codon
substitution underlined. the two fragments containing the
mutation were used as megaprimers and amplified by a third
round of pcr. the product was then digested with xbai
and xhoi and subcloned into the pgf23 vector. clones
obtained after mutagenesis procedures were confirmed by
sequencing.
protein purification, sds-page, protein determination,
and steady-state analysis. recombinant murine erythroid
alas and the h282a variant were purified from dh5r
escherichia coli bacterial cells containing the overexpressed
protein as previously described (19). sufficient expression
of h282y and h282f variants could not be obtained. the

in 20 mm mops for ph 6.7, hepes for ph 7-8, or
ampso for ph 8.2-9.5. the ph dependencies of log kcat

spectroscopic measurements. prior to spectroscopic measurement, enzyme was dialyzed in 20 mm hepes (ph 7.5)
with 10% glycerol to remove free plp. absorption spectra
were acquired at ambient temperature using a shimadzu uv
2100 dual-beam spectrophotometer, with a reference containing all components except the purified enzyme. circular
dichroism (cd) spectra were obtained using an aviv cd
spectrometer calibrated for both wavelength maxima and
signal intensity with an aqueous solution of  xxxg446xxx -camphorsulfonic acid (22). protein concentrations were 10-11 and
100 ¬µm for the near- and far-uv cd spectra, respectively,
in 20 mm bis-tris (ph 7.5) containing 10% glycerol. spectra
were recorded in triplicate and averaged, using a 0.1 cm path
length cuvette with a total volume of 300 ¬µl. fluorescence
spectra were collected on a shimadzu re-5301 pc spectrofluorophotometer using protein concentrations of 2-4 ¬µm.
the ph was adjusted with 20 mm mops (ph range of 6.77.0), 20 mm hepes (ph range of 7-8.2), or 20 mm
ampso (ph range of 8.3-9.5). glycerol (10%) was also
included in the buffers. cd and fluorescence blank spectra
were collected from samples containing all components
except protein immediately prior to the measurement of
samples. the blank spectra were subtracted from spectra of

stopped-flow spectroscopy. rapid scanning stopped-flow
measurements were conducted using a model rsm-100
stopped-flow spectrophotometer (olis inc.). this instrument
has a dead time of approximately 2 ms and an observation
chamber path length of 4 mm. scan spectra covering a
wavelength range of 300-510 nm were collected at a rate
of 1000 scans/s and then averaged to 62 scans/s to reduce
data files to a manageable level. the temperature of the
syringes and the stopped-flow cell compartment was maintained at 30 ¬∞c with an external water bath. the concentration of glycine was always at least 10-fold greater than the
concentration of the enzyme to ensure pseudo-first-order
kinetics were observed.
for each experimental condition, three replicate experiments were performed. the absorbance changes at 420 nm
(‚àÜabsorbance420) were globally fit using the simulation
program dynafit to the binding mechanisms described in
schemes 2 and 3 (23).
determination of dissociation constants of glycine and
ala. dissociation constants were determined spectroscopically by monitoring spectral changes upon the binding of
glycine and ala (24). the kd values for glycine from ph
6.7 to 9.5 were determined at 30 ¬∞c for alas and the
h282a variant by monitoring the increase in cofactor
absorbance at 420 nm upon glycine binding. the ph was
adjusted with 20 mm mops (ph range of 6.7-7.0), 20 mm
hepes (ph range of 7-8.2), or 20 mm ampso (ph range

preparation of the apoenzyme and determination of the
plp dissociation constant. to obtain the h282a apoenzyme, 1 mg/ml enzyme in 20 mm hepes (ph 7.5)
containing 20% glycerol was treated with 150 mm phenylhydrazine for 1.5 h at 4 ¬∞c, following which phenylhydrazine
was removed by running the solution through a pd-10
column. the phenylhydrazine treatment was then repeated
to ensure all plp was removed.
the plp kd for the h282a variant was determined at
25 ¬∞c by monitoring the plp-dependent increase in the
510 nm fluorescence emission upon excitation at 420 nm,
in a buffer composed of 20 mm hepes (ph 7.5) and 10%

results
spectroscopic properties of the h282a variant. at ph
7.4, three absorbance maxima at approximately 278, 330,
and 420 nm are observed in both alas and the h282a
variant (figure 2a). the absorbance at 278 nm is primarily
due to the protein, while the 330 and 420 nm maxima are
common in plp-dependent enzymes and are typically
attributed to deprotonated and protonated aldimine species,
respectively (25). a similar assignment for alas is ambiguous because the spectrum is unchanged in the ph range of
6.5-9.5.2 the mutation had no discernible effect on the
protein absorption band centered at 278 nm, but the cofactor
absorption peaks were significantly altered. the ratio of the
420 to 330 nm absorbance was increased from 0.45 in the
wild-type enzyme to 1.05 in the variant.

alas (2) and 3.5 ¬µm h282a (b) at varying ph values. each of
the lines represents the nonlinear regression fit to eq 3.

the changes in the absorption spectra were reflected in
the fluorescence spectra (figure 2b,c). upon excitation at
330 nm, alas exhibits only one maximum at 385 nm, while
in h282a, the 385 nm fluorescence emission maximum is
shifted to 410 nm with a 6-fold decrease and a second
maximum is observed at 510 nm. with excitation at 420 nm,
the cofactor exhibits a fluorescence emission maximum at
510 nm for both enzymes; however, the magnitude of the
510 nm emission was ‚àº7 times greater in the h282a. the
ph titration of the species emitting at 510 nm upon excitation
at 420 nm demonstrated that this species diminished as a
result of loss of a single proton for both enzymes
(figure 3). a fit of the data to eq 3 yields pka values of
8.05 ( 0.043 and 9.02 ( 0.07 for alas and h282a,
respectively.
kinetic characterization of the h282a variant. the
steady-state kinetic parameters of the h282a variant were
determined, and the results are summarized in table 1. the
mutation resulted in a kcat of 1.4% of the wild-type alas
value. the km for glycine was increased 5-fold relative to
that of alas, while the km for succinyl-coa was not
significantly affected. the overall catalytic efficiency for
glycine and succinyl-coa decreased 450- and 87-fold,
respectively, as compared to alas values.
if h282 acts as if it is donating a hydrogen bond to the
phenolic oxygen of the cofactor, then the h282a mutation
may lower the pka for the imine nitrogen. to investigate
this possibility, the ph dependence of the steady-state kinetic
parameters was studied, with the results summarized in table
2 and figure 4. the log kcat versus ph profile for h282a
decreased on both the acidic and basic sides, and the best fit
of the data to eq 1 generated a pka of 7.2 ( 0.1 for a residue
in the enzyme-substrate complex that must be protonated
for optimal catalysis. a second pka of 8.6 ( 0.1 for a residue
that is deprotonated during catalysis was also observed for
h282a, which shifted from the previously reported pka of
9.1 ( 0.03 in alas (12). the possibility of an acidic limb
pka, below 7.0, in the wild-type enzyme could not be
investigated due to instability at ph values below 6.5-7.0
(12), but the available data do suggest that the h282a
mutation results in a substantial increase in the pka of an
important enzyme-substrate complex ionization. this ionization might be assigned directly to h282, or it could be
assigned to the imine nitrogen that presumably shares a
proton with the phenolic oxygen atom.
the log kcat/km-ph profile for the mutant was similar to
that of the wild-type enzyme, decreasing on both the acidic

turbeville et al.
and basic limbs. nonlinear regression of the data using eq 1
yielded pka values for the acidic and basic limb of 8.00 (
0.14 and 8.50 ( 0.14, respectively, for h282a, which reflects
a shift in the acidic limb from the pka value of 8.60 ( 0.11
previously reported in alas (12). the ph variation of the
log 1/kgly
decreased with an increase in ph for both
m
enzymes. the data were fit to eq 2 to generate a pka of
8.36 ( 0.1 for alas and a pka of 7.76 ( 0.16 for the
h282a variant. the log kcat and log kcat/kgly
profiles
m
limiting slopes of approximately 1 or -1 indicate the
ionization of a single group for acidic and basic limbs. given
that glycine is not a sticky substrate and does not ionize over
the ph range that was studied, the pka observed for 1/kgly
m
and the acidic limb of the log kcat/kgly
m likely represents
group(s) in the free enzyme.
reaction of glycine with the h282a variant. the reaction
of 60 ¬µm h282a variant with glycine resulted in an
increased absorbance at 420 nm (figure 5a). the data best
fitted to the two-step process described by scheme 2
(figure 5b,c). a fit of the data yielded the following
values: k1 ) (0.001654 ( 3.8) √ó 10-5 s-1, k-1 ) 0.14 (
0.0064 s-1, k2 ) 0.022 ( 0.0025 s-1, and k-2 ) 0.0455 (
0.0016 s-1.
dissociation constants for the binding of glycine and
ala. to elucidate a potential role of h282 in substrate
binding, the enzymes were titrated with glycine and ala
to determine the dissociation constants for formations of the
external aldimine with the substrate and product. at ph 7.5,
the kd values for ala and glycine increase 8.5- and 5-fold,
respectively, relative to that of alas (table 1). to establish
if the ionization of groups reflected in the kcat profiles is
involved in substrate binding or catalysis, the ph dependence
of kd for glycine was determined. the loss of the plpo3-h282 interaction also had a marked effect on the ph
gly
profile for the kgly
d values. for alas, kd decreases with
an increase in ph and, when fitted to eq 1, yielded a pka
value at the boundary of the ph range that was tested;
therefore, a pka of e7 was assumed. in contrast, the kgly
d
values for the h282a variant fit to a bell curve with pka
values  xxxd2274xxx .4 ( 0.2 and 8.1 ( 0.2 (figure 6). the data
indicate that the h282 mutation results in a substantial
modification to the pka of an enzyme-glycine complex
ionization.
ph titration of quinonoid intermediate formation for the
h282a variant. when alas is saturated with ala, the
external aldimine is converted to a quinonoid intermediate
in a ph-dependent manner; the extent of this reaction can
be monitored by following the absorbance of the quinonoid
intermediate at 510 nm. formation of the ala-bound
quinonoid intermediate in alas has been reported to occur
with an apparent pka of 8.1 ( 0.1 (24) and involves
participation of the active site k313, which acts as a general
base catalyst for the reaction by abstracting a proton from
the ala aldimine to form the quinonoid intermediate (26).
the ala-bound quinonoid intermediate was observed to
increase with ph for h282a, as observed previously in
alas (18), although the amplitude of the absorption of the
quinonoid intermediate was markedly diminished by the
mutation at all ph values that were tested (figure 7a). ph
titration of the h282a quinonoid intermediate absorbance
demonstrated that the intermediate was formed as a result

active site. the circular dichroism in the uv-visible region
reflects the plp microenvironment by monitoring the asymmetry of the bound cofactor. formation of an external
aldimine results in the reorientation of the plp cofactor
which can be followed with cd spectroscopy (27). spectra
of the holo and ligand-bound enzymes were collected
(figure 8). spectra of the free enzyme exhibited positive
dichroic bands at ‚àº330 and 420 nm with an increase in the
magnitude of the 420 nm band with an associated decrease
in the magnitude of the ‚àº330 nm band observed in the
variant. the addition of glycine to alas or h282a resulted
in a comparable decrease in the magnitude of the ‚àº330 nm
dichroic band, while the magnitude of the ‚àº420 nm band
decreased 75% in the variant and disappeared in the alas
spectra. the addition of a saturating concentration of ala
to alas or h282a had strikingly different effects on the
relative chiral environment of the external aldimine in the
two enzymes. specifically, the magnitude of the ‚àº330 nm
dichroic band was decreased, and the ‚àº420 nm band
disappeared in the alas spectra; the addition of ala to
h282a resulted in a moderate increase in the magnitude of
the 330 nm band and little change in the ‚àº420 nm band.
the cd spectra for alas and h282a between 200 and
300 nm were similar, indicating that no significant changes
occurred in the overall conformation as a result of the
mutation (data not shown).

the role of h282 in cofactor binding, the effect of the h282

of the h282a apoenzyme with plp leads to the reconstitution of the holoenzyme, which can be monitored by following

discussion
the crystal structure of rhodobacter capsulatus alas
reveals the existence of a hydrogen bond between h282 and
the phenolic oxygen atom of the plp cofactor (10). a clustal
sequence alignment demonstrated that this histidine residue
was perfectly conserved in more than 70 known alas
sequences from bacteria to mammals (data not shown). the
existence of one, and often two, hydrogen bonds between
the enzyme and the plp phenolic oxygen is common in fold
type i plp-dependent enzymes and is likely multifunctional.
the alas crystal structures suggest possible roles for h282
in the binding and orientation of the cofactor within the active
site, as well as control of the electronic status of the cofactor
during catalysis (9). these possibilities led us to postulate
that mutation of h282 should have multiple effects on
substrate and cofactor binding, as well as catalysis. in this
communication, we constructed alas variants harboring the
h282a, h282y, and h282f mutations, of which only the
h282a variant was recoverable as a soluble enzyme. the
effects of the h282a mutation on the spectroscopic and

role of histidine 282 in 5- xxxd148xxx  synthase
kinetic properties of the enzyme were characterized in an
effort to better understand the functional roles of h282 in
the alas-catalyzed formation of ala.
the absorption spectra (figure 2) indicate the mutation
has a substantial effect on the electronics of the plp cofactor.
a decrease in the absorbance of the 330 nm peak is
accompanied by an increase in the absorbance of the
420 nm peak. these changes are reflected in the cofactor
fluorescence spectra. in some transaminases, including
aspartate aminotransferase and  xxxg2250xxx , the
corresponding absorbance peaks titrate as a function of ph
with the long wavelength peak favored at low ph and the
short wavelength peak favored at high ph (14, 28). these
are generally attributed to the ketoenamine and enolamine
tautomers, respectively, which differ in the position of the
proton shared between the phenolic oxygen and the schiff
base nitrogen atoms. the changes in the absorbance spectra
for h282a suggest that the mutation significantly alters the
equilibrium of cofactor tautomeric structures to favor the
ketoenamine, but this assignment is ambiguous because,
unlike aspartate and tyrosine aminotransferases, the absorbance spectrum of alas is largely ph-independent and the
h282a mutation did not alter this property (data not shown).
in contrast to the absorption spectra, fluorescence spectra
of alas upon excitation at 330 or 420 nm are ph-dependent
(12). upon excitation at 420 nm, the alas 510 nm
fluorescence emission titrates with a single pka of 8.05 (
0.043, while in h282a, a pka of 9.02 ( 0.07 is observed
under similar conditions (figure 3). the magnitude of the
385 nm fluorescence emission signal resulting from excitation at 330 nm, which occurs with a pka of 8.4 ( 0.1 in the
wild-type enzyme, is greatly diminished in the mutant, and
an equivalent titration could not be performed.
the two pka values observed in alas fluorescence
spectra are presumably indicative of more complex chemistry
than simple titration of the schiff base nitrogen atom. this
is not unprecedented, as in dialkylglycine decarboxylase,
three pka values are observed during absorbance spectra
titrations, with both ketoenamine and enolamine species
present in each ionization state (29). for both dialkylglycine
decarboxylase and  xxxg913xxx , it has been
proposed that the multiple ionizations that are observed
reflect active site residues that regulate the distribution of
ketoenamine and enolamine tautomers through electrostatic
effects (29, 30). in alas, the ionizations observed in the
fluorescence spectra, but not the absorption spectra, are also
likely to be attributable to active site residues and not the
schiff base nitrogen. alterations observed in the h282a
spectra may be due to changes in both tautomeric equilibria
and the electrostatic interactions between the phenolic oxygen
and other active site residues.
the steady-state kinetic parameters of the variant indicate
that loss of interaction of h282 with the phenolic oxygen
impairs both glycine binding and catalysis. the kgly
m increased 5-fold, and the kcat decreased by 2 orders of
magnitude. rapid-scanning stopped-flow analysis experiments were performed to further characterize the effect of
the mutation. a pre-steady-state burst of the quinonoid
intermediate for the reaction of the h282a-glycine complex
and succinyl-coa was not observed, presumably due to
diminished absorption of the quinonoid intermediate that is

biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 20, 2007 5979
typically observed with the wild-type enzyme (data not
shown).
the transimination reaction expected to occur during
glycine binding involves nucleophilic attack of the protonated
schiff base internal aldimine by the deprotonated amine of
glycine, to form a transient gem-diamine intermediate. if the
hydrogen bond donated by h282 to the phenolic oxygen of
the cofactor is important in the maintenance of a protonated
schiff base, then the loss of this hydrogen bond in h282a
might be expected to slow the rate at which glycine binds
to the enzyme. in the absence of succinyl-coa, binding of
glycine to h282a is a two-step process (figure 5). previous
studies demonstrated that glycine also binds with alas in
two steps; however, the rates associated with the fast phase
were not slow enough to be resolved (18). the slow phase
rate for h282a decreased 85% relative to that of alas.
the slower binding of glycine observed in h282a may be
attributed to alterations in the electronic status of the schiff
base, but other interpretations are also possible. one interesting possibility is that h282 is directly or indirectly involved
in proton transfers that convert the internal aldimine and
glycine to the reactive ionic states necessary for formation
of the glycine external aldimine (scheme, 1). in any case,
these data, along with the data in figure 6, indicate an
important role for h282 in glycine binding.
the ph dependencies of log kcat, log kcat/kgly
m , and log 1/
were all diminished in the h282a-catalyzed reaction,
indicating that the mutation had severe catalytic consequences (figure 4), but only the log kcat profile contained an
ionization that was obviously changed by the mutation. the
appearance of a new pka of ‚àº7.3 for h282a in the acidic
limb of both log kcat and log kgly
d suggests that the mutation
results in a substantial change to a pka for the enzymeglycine complex. in alas, kcat is known to be determined
by release of ala, or a conformational change associated
with ala release (18). the appearance of an acidic limb
ionization in the log kcat versus ph profile for h282a shifted
the ph optimum from less than 6.5 to slightly more than
8.0 and indicates a change in the nature of the ratedetermining step for catalysis, at least at lower ph values.
the further observation that a similar pka is apparent in the
log kgly
d versus ph profile suggests that in h282a the ratedetermining step at ph <8.0 may be associated with binding
of glycine. the alas spectroscopic pka of 8.4 ( 0.1
observed upon excitation at 330 nm is mirrored in the log
1/km and the acidic limb of log kcat/km versus ph profile of
alas (12). although it was not possible to titrate the
equivalent species in the h282a spectra, the ph dependence
of log 1/km and acidic log kcat/km was shifted to ‚àº7.9. this
ionization controls the reactive free enzyme species, and the
disappearance or significant reduction of the equivalent
species in the h282a spectrum suggests that h282 stabilizes
the reactive form of the internal aldimine.
in alas, the binding of ala results in the appearance
of an ala-quinonoid intermediate with a 510 nm absorbance (24). in h282a, the addition of ala results in a
decrease in absorbance at 420 nm with an associated increase
at 330 nm as well as the appearance of a 510 nm absorbance,
though the amplitude of the 510 nm absorption associated
with the ala-quinonoid species is markedly diminished.
while the kd value for ala is minimally affected, the pka
kgly
m

5980 biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 20, 2007
of the ala-quinonoid intermediate is increased from
8.1 ( 0.1 in alas to 8.8 ( 0.1 in h282a. the data suggest
that abstraction of a proton from ala is impaired in the
variant. one possible explanation is that the loss of the
hydrogen bond between the phenolic oxygen and h282 is
likely to cause a net flow of electrons into the conjugated
pi-bond system, thereby disrupting the electron sink capacity
of the cofactor.
additionally, it has been suggested that the process of
ala binding and quinonoid intermediate formation may
involve some structural reorganization of the active site (18).
in both the glycine- and succinyl-coa-soaked r. capsulatus
alas crystals, a 15¬∞ rotation of the pyridine ring around
the c5-c5a bonds occurs such that the o3 and  xxxg283xxx  atoms
move away from the catalytic lysine (10). when the product
binds in aons, a similar rotation of the pyridine ring occurs
along with subtle rearrangement of the active site hydrogen
bond system (13). in r. capsulatus alas, the movement
of o3 is tracked by the residue equivalent to murine alas
h282 (10), indicating that this residue is probably involved
in coordinating the movement of the pyridine ring with the
reorganization of the hydrogen bond system occurring upon
substrate binding. h282 is tethered between the phenolic o3
atom of plp and y121 by way of hydrogen bonds between
the imidazole n2 and ndelta1 atoms, respectively. the loss of
hydrogen bonds of h282 with the cofactor and y121 would
likely affect the plp movement and orientation within the
active site that are presumably a crucial aspect of the catalytic
process.
the possibility that the plp microenvironment is affected
in solution by the h282a mutation was examined using cd
spectroscopy, performed in the absence and presence of ala
or glycine. the spectra for the alas and h282a holoenzymes are relatively similar and exhibit two positive dichroic
bands around 330 and 420 nm (figure 8) which mirror the
shift from the 330 to 420 nm species observed in the
absorbance spectra (figure 2). in these holoenzyme spectra,
the cofactor is covalently anchored to the enzyme via the
internal aldimine linkage with the active site lysine, and this
attachment would be expected to maintain the orientation
of the cofactor in the active site. however, upon formation
of an external aldimine with glycine or ala, the attachment
of the cofactor to the active site lysine is lost, and the
resulting cd spectra diverge in the two enzymes. upon
addition of glycine, the 420 nm dichroic band disappears in
alas, while the band continues to be observed in the
h282a spectra (figure 8). in alas, the binding of ala
results in the loss of the 330 nm band and a significantly
weakened ‚àº420 nm band. in contrast, the binding of ala
to h282a results in a spectrum remarkably similar to that
of the holoenzyme. the divergence observed in the ligandbound cd spectra of alas and h282a suggests that the
reorientation of the plp cofactor, observed with alas upon
external aldimine formation, is blocked or diminished by the
h282a mutation. this would influence both the cofactor
position and interaction with key catalytic residues and could
help explain the multiple effects caused by the mutation in
the variant.
in summary, h282 is involved in a hydrogen bond with
the phenolic oxygen of the plp cofactor. the deletion of
this interaction in the h282a variant has multiple effects
on the spectral, binding, and kinetic properties of the enzyme

turbeville et al.
that support the conclusion that h282 plays multiple roles
in the enzymology of alas. it may also be further
concluded that the impaired function of the variant results
from a combination of direct and indirect effects, including
alterations in the protonation of the phenolic oxygen and
changes to the stereoelectronic relationships between the
cofactor and active site residues, through the disruption in
the processional plp positioning that normally occurs during
catalysis.
