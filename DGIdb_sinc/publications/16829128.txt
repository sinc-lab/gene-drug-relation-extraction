several temperature-activated transient receptor potential (thermotrp) ion channels are the molecular receptors of natural compounds
that evoke thermal and pain sensations. menthol, popularly known for
its cooling effect, activates  xxxg2334xxx —a cold-activated thermotrp ion
channel. however, human physiological studies demonstrate a paradoxical role of menthol in modulation of warm sensation, and here, we
show that menthol also activates heat-activated  xxxg2336xxx . we further
show that menthol inhibits trpa1, potentially explaining the use of
menthol as an analgesic. similar to menthol, both camphor and
cinnamaldehyde (initially reported to be specific activators of  xxxg2336xxx 
and trpa1, respectively) also modulate other thermotrps. therefore,
we find that many ‘‘sensory compounds’’ presumed to be specific have
a promiscuous relationship with thermotrps.

introduction
a subset of the transient receptor potential (trp) ion
channels is activated by temperature (dubbed thermotrps) and
a variety of plant-derived sensory chemicals. members of the
 xxxd428xxx  subfamily are activated by heat (trpv1-4) and by
sensory compounds that elicit sensations of heat or warmth
(trpv1 and  xxxg2336xxx ). trpv1 is activated by capsaicin (active

component of chili peppers) and camphor (aromatic botanical
derived from the cinnamonum camphora tree) in addition to
heat (43-c) (caterina et al., 1997) (xu et al., 2005). warmthactivated (33-c)  xxxg2336xxx  is also activated by camphor (peier
et al., 2002b; xu et al., 2002; moqrich et al., 2005).  xxxg2334xxx 
and trpa1, members of the melastatin and ankyrin repeat
subfamilies, respectively, are both activated by a range of
cooling temperatures ( xxxg2334xxx  <25-c, trpa1 <17-c)
(mckemy et al., 2002; peier et al., 2002a; story et al.,
2003). natural compounds that evoke cooling sensations such
as mint-derived menthol activate  xxxg2334xxx , whereas pungent
compounds derived from garlic, cinnamon, and mustard seeds
activate trpa1 (mckemy et al., 2002; peier et al., 2002a;
bandell et al., 2004; jordt et al., 2004; bautista et al., 2005;
macpherson et al., 2005). all of these channels are expressed
within cells essential to cutaneous thermal and pain sensation.
trpv1,  xxxg2334xxx  and trpa1 are predominantly expressed within
sensory neurons of the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia (drg),
while  xxxg2336xxx  is expressed in keratinocytes (skin cells) (patapoutian
et al., 2003).
these sensory compounds have been of great utility in
furthering our understanding of the function of thermotrp
channels in sensory systems. for instance, in vitro pharmacological
studies of cultured drg neurons show that menthol, capsaicin and
cinnamon oil (cinnamaldehyde) activate functionally distinct (and
temperature-sensitive) subsets of neurons, similar to the in vivo
expression patterns of  xxxg2334xxx , trpv1 and trpa1 (story et al.,
2003; bandell et al., 2004). these compounds have also proven to
be highly useful tools in mouse behavioral and genetic studies,
providing confirmation about their in vivo sensory effects and the
physiology of the thermotrps (and neurons) they activate
(caterina et al., 2000; davis et al., 2000; moqrich et al., 2005).
in fact, capsaicin sensitivity has been used to study the physiology
of nociceptive neurons even before the discovery of trpv1
(winter et al., 1995). overall, studies of sensory compounds have
contributed evidence to a simple model of sensory coding:

activation of thermotrps account directly for sensations evoked—
e.g. capsaicin’s sensory effects are explained by trpv1 activation;
and menthol’s, via  xxxg2334xxx  activation.
menthol enhances cooling sensations at room temperature, but
at temperatures above 37-c, it enhances sensations of warmth
(green, 1985). therefore, we challenged menthol’s specificity by
reexamining its activity on thermotrps other than  xxxg2334xxx .
surprisingly, we find that menthol activates  xxxg2336xxx  and inhibits
trpa1. we also extended these studies to other sensory compounds and find that most have a promiscuous relationship with
thermotrps, activating and inhibiting multiple ion channels.
indeed, we find that only capsaicin specifically ‘‘coupled’’ to a
single channel. many of the relationships we find are likely to be
relevant as these chemicals are used at considerably high
concentrations in over-the-counter products.

results
menthol activates  xxxg2336xxx  and inhibits trpa1
a curious effect of cooling menthol is its paradoxical enhancement of perceived warmth intensity in tests of human subjects.
solutions containing 0.02% menthol (equivalent to ¨1.3 mm) feel
significantly warmer than water alone at temperatures above 37-c
(green, 1985). in addition, in a recent psychophysical study, 10%
of subjects reported spontaneous sensations of warmth after
application of 40% menthol (equivalent to 2.56 m) (hatem et al.,
2006). we sought to identify mechanism(s) for the warming effect
of menthol by challenging the specificity of menthol activation of
cold-sensing  xxxg2334xxx  and testing whether it could activate the
recently identified warm- and heat-sensing thermotrps. we
performed whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology and calcium
imaging experiments on stable cell lines and cho cells transiently
transfected with the thermotrps. we tested menthol concentrations ranging from 0.5 – 2 mm. these concentrations approximate
those used in human psychophysical studies and are considerably
lower than those used in over-the-counter products (¨500 mm)
(yosipovitch et al., 1996; namer et al., 2005). menthol, which
activates  xxxg2334xxx  with an ec50 of ¨30 am, did not activate
trpv1, trpa1, or naı̈ve cho cells at higher concentrations
(0.5 – 2 mm) in calcium imaging studies (data not shown) (peier et
al., 2002a). however, in cho cells expressing  xxxg2336xxx , 0.5 mm
menthol evoked  xxxg2336xxx  currents, which increased in magnitude
with 2 mm (fig. 1a, and data not shown).  xxxg2336xxx  currents with
repeated application of 0.5 mm menthol were sensitizing,
consistent with the nature of repeated heat and camphor activation
of  xxxg2336xxx  (fig. 1a; moqrich et al., 2005). since  xxxg2336xxx  is
expressed in skin keratinocytes, we tested whether menthol could
activate native  xxxg2336xxx  in primary cultured keratinocytes in
calcium imaging assays (fig. 1b). application of 1 mm menthol
activated wild-type mouse keratinocytes. as we have shown
before, application of 1 mm camphor with 50 am 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-apb) also activated wild-type keratinocytes (moqrich et al., 2005). neither menthol nor camphor plus
2apb was able to activate primary keratinocytes cultured from
 xxxg2336xxx  knockout animals (moqrich et al., 2005). application of
100 am atp serves as a positive control for both wild type and
knockout keratinocytes.
 xxxg2334xxx  (and trpv1) is voltage-activated, and menthol shifts
the voltage sensitivity of  xxxg2334xxx  to more physiological levels

(brauchi et al., 2004; voets et al., 2004). recently, it was shown
that  xxxg2336xxx  can also be voltage-activated, at least in some active
states (chung et al., 2005). we tested if menthol modulates voltage
sensitivity of  xxxg2336xxx . at concentrations as low as 1 mm, menthol
reversibly increased  xxxg2336xxx  whole-cell currents in a voltagedependent manner (fig. 1a, right and bottom panels). while a
leftward shift in voltage dependence may contribute to  xxxg2336xxx 
activation by menthol, further studies will be required to address
the mechanism of activation. although poor solubility of menthol
at concentrations >20 mm precluded maximal activation of
 xxxg2336xxx  (fig. 1c, left panel), the data indicate an estimated ec50
for menthol of ¨20 mm (19.8 mm 95% ci: 11.3 – 35.0 mm). this
is a crude estimate, as menthol insolubility at high concentrations
prevented us from obtaining a full response curve. however, these
results were corroborated in whole-cell voltage clamp studies (fig.
1c, right panel). these data suggest menthol activation of  xxxg2336xxx 
could contribute to menthol-induced sensitization to warm stimuli
(see discussion).
menthol is marketed in the formulation of many topical pain
treatments as a counterirritant and analgesic, but the mechanisms of
its anti-pain actions are unclear. the cooling sensation of menthol
could distract us from pain; alternatively, it could block the activity
of a pain-sensing molecule. we considered whether the analgesic
effects of menthol could act via inactivation of the pain-sensing
thermotrps. we performed calcium imaging and electrophysiological studies on cho cells expressing trpa1 and trpv1.
menthol at concentrations up to 2 mm did not inhibit the heat or
capsaicin-evoked activity of trpv1 (data not shown). solutions of
higher concentrations of menthol (5 mm) induced increased
fluorescence ratios (indicative of calcium influx and/or release
from intracellular stores) in naı̈ve cho cells. 5 mm menthol also
attenuated cho cell responses to 10 am atp, suggesting nonspecific effects and disruption of calcium signaling by menthol at
this high concentration (data not shown). human embryonic
kidney (hek) cells used in flipr determinations of menthol
ec50 on  xxxg2336xxx  and  xxxg2334xxx  were more resistant to activation by
high concentrations of menthol (fig. 1c). however, modest
menthol concentrations (<1 mm) strongly inhibited calcium influx
via trpa1 in response to both cold and cinnamaldehyde in
calcium imaging and electrophysiology studies (figs. 1d and e
and data not shown). the ic50 for menthol inhibition of trpa1
activated by 75 am cinnamaldehyde was 68 am (95% ci: 35.6 –
128.5 am) (fig. 1f). these experiments clearly show that
menthol’s sensory effects are not limited to  xxxg2334xxx  activation.
 xxxg2336xxx  activation and trpa1 inhibition by submillimolar menthol
is likely to be relevant, as these chemicals are often used in balms
at concentrations that are orders of magnitude greater.
given that menthol effects  xxxg2336xxx  and trpa1 in addition to
 xxxg2334xxx , we tested whether camphor, cinnamaldehyde and
capsaicin might also modulate the activity of more than one
thermotrp receptor. therefore, we extended our studies and
performed a ‘‘4  4’’ analysis of the specificity of four sensory
compounds on four thermotrps. we employed a screen for
activating or inhibiting relationships of varying concentrations of
camphor, cinnamaldehyde and capsaicin on four thermotrps—
 xxxg2336xxx , trpa1,  xxxg2334xxx  and trpv1 (thermotrps known to be
activated by sensory compounds) (table 1). for each compoundchannel pairing, we investigated both agonistic and antagonistic
effects. we used the same criteria to evaluate the specificity of the
effect on thermotrps: high compound concentrations should not
induce calcium release/influx nor disrupt native atp responses in

camphor inhibits trpa1 and activates trpv1
application of camphor on human skin leads to sensitization to
heat (and to a lesser extent cold) and like menthol, camphor is an
ingredient of many topical analgesics (green, 1990). we recently
reported that camphor activates  xxxg2336xxx  (moqrich et al., 2005).
similar to the situation for menthol, we reasoned that camphor
might also block trpa1 or trpv1. calcium imaging studies
using 0.25 – 2 mm camphor showed no inhibition of trpv1 or
activation/inhibition of  xxxg2334xxx  (data not shown, see below).
however, 0.25 mm camphor inhibited cold- and cinnamaldehydeinduced trpa1 responses (figs. 1d and f). the ic50 for camphor

inhibition of trpa1 activation by 75 am cinnamaldehyde was 68
am (95% ci: 36.8 – 127.0 am) (fig. 1f), similar to the
concentration dependence of menthol. to validate heterologous
expression studies, we tested the inhibitory effects of camphor on
cinnamaldehyde responses in cultured drg neurons as described
(bandell et al., 2004). menthol was not tested as a blocker in these
studies to avoid confounds produced by menthol sensitivity of
 xxxg2334xxx -expressing drg neurons. application of 2 mm camphor
during constant 0.2 mm cinnamaldehyde perfusion strongly
inhibited cinnamaldehyde-induced intracellular calcium responses
in drg neurons (183 total cells, 9/10 cinnamaldehyde-sensitive
cells blocked, data not shown). high concentrations of camphor
(10 mm) were recently reported to inhibit basal currents of trpa1
but block of agonist-activation of trpa1 was not reported (xu
et al., 2005). here, we show that relatively low concentrations of
both camphor and menthol block activation of trpa1 induced by
multiple stimuli.
in our published report on  xxxg2336xxx  activation by camphor, we
screened for specificity in relation to other thermotrps by using
calcium imaging and 1 – 2 mm concentrations (moqrich et al.,
2005). we did not test concentrations above 2 mm camphor as
background calcium influx/release was observed in naı̈ve cho
cells. utilizing this technique and these concentrations, we found
camphor to be a specific activator of  xxxg2336xxx . however, a recent
study showed that trpv1 exhibited small responses to 1 mm
camphor, becoming more robust with concentrations up to 10 mm
in electrophysiological recordings from hek cells (xu et al.,
2005). as with high concentrations of menthol, in flipr studies,
background activation of hek cells by camphor was minimal (fig.
1c). although a maximal response of trpv1 to camphor was not
achieved because of insolubility at high concentrations, the ec50
value based on the initial concentration dependence curve is 4.55
mm (95% ci: 1.39 – 14.92 mm) (table 1). we revisited the
camphor – trpv1 relationship using electrophysiological recordings of trpv1-expressing cho cells and found that 2 mm
camphor activated trpv1, albeit to a lesser extent than 100 nm
capsaicin (fig. 2a).
we also revisited camphor sensitivity of cultured drg neurons
using whole-cell recordings. similar to our previous findings, we
did not observe sensitizing  xxxg2336xxx -like currents in response to 5
mm camphor (moqrich et al., 2005). however, similar to the report
by xu et al., a small and strongly desensitizing current was
observed in a subset of capsaicin-sensitive neurons, presumably via
activation of trpv1. importantly, drg neurons derived from both
wild-type and  xxxg2336xxx  knockout mice revealed similar responses to
camphor (figs. 2b – d). this is consistent with the hypothesis that
camphor-induced small desensitizing currents are mediated by
trpv1. in electrophysiological studies, the number of camphorsensitive neurons observed was dependent on the sequence of
agonist application: for wild-type drg neurons, 24% of capsaicinsensitive neurons showed currents in response to camphor pulses
when applied after a capsaicin application (fig. 2c, top); while
71% were sensitive when camphor was applied prior to capsaicin
(fig. 2c, bottom). in  xxxg2336xxx  knockout drg neurons, 25% of
capsaicin-sensitive neurons were also responsive to camphor,
similar to wild type (fig. 2c, right). 5 mm camphor failed to
activate all capsaicin-sensitive neurons because it is a weak agonist
compared to capsaicin, and because camphor-induced currents are
subject to desensitization when applied after an initial capsaicin
application (protocol used in our previous study). in calcium
imaging studies of cultured drg neurons, 85% and 82% of

camphor-sensitive neurons also responded to capsaicin in wild type
and  xxxg2336xxx  knockout mice, respectively (fig. 2d). in this
protocol, 5 mm camphor was applied first, allowed to wash out
for 5 min, and then 100 am capsaicin was applied. using this
protocol, 24 wild-type and 22  xxxg2336xxx  knockout neurons responded
to camphor, but not to capsaicin. this could represent activation of
a receptor distinct from trpv1 and  xxxg2336xxx . alternatively, it might
be due to camphor’s desensitization of some trpv1-expressing
neurons despite a relatively long period of camphor washout.
psychophysical experiments have revealed that camphor, as
opposed to capsaicin, is not pungent, reinforcing a role of camphor
in desensitization rather than activation of trpv1 (xu et al.,
2005).
impact of cinnamaldehyde and capsaicin on thermotrps
solutions containing 0.2 – 10% (¨1.5 – 75 mm) cinnamaldehyde induce burning sensations in humans (prescott and swaincampbell, 2000; namer et al., 2005). in our previously published
report on cinnamaldehyde activation of trpa1, we screened for
activation of thermotrps (trpv1,  xxxg2334xxx , trpv2, trpv4)
using concentrations of up to 0.6 mm cinnamaldehyde (bandell et
al., 2004). the higher cinnamaldehyde concentrations used in
human studies might contribute to the overall sensations of pain via
activation (or inhibition) of thermotrps in addition to trpa1.
trpv1 was not activated by cinnamaldehyde concentrations of up
to 2 mm. we were unable to test higher concentrations of
cinnamaldehyde on trpv1, as the amount of ethanol required to
dissolve such amounts of cinnamaldehyde can alone activate
trpv1 (data not shown) (trevisani et al., 2002). interestingly,
cinnamaldehyde (0.5 – 5 mm) activates  xxxg2336xxx  (fig. 3a). although responses to 0.5 mm cinnamaldehyde were small, the effect
of higher concentrations (5 mm) was specific to  xxxg2336xxx . although
a dose response curve shows increasing  xxxg2336xxx  activity to
increasing concentrations of cinnamaldehyde, background fluorescence of untransfected hek and cho cells also increased,
precluding an ec50 determination (data not shown). up to 5 mm,
concentrations of cinnamaldehyde did not activate non-transfected
cho cells, nor did it diminish native responses to 10 am atp (data
not shown). vehicle (ethanol) concentrations ranging from 0.5 –
1.0% also had no effect on  xxxg2336xxx  or naı̈ve cho cells.
intriguingly, cinnamaldehyde had the opposite effect on
 xxxg2334xxx . both cold and menthol responses were attenuated by
cinnamaldehyde in a concentration-dependent manner with 5 mm
concentrations causing complete block (figs. 3b and c). 5 mm
cinnamaldehyde contains 0.5% ethanol. ethanol is known to
modulate  xxxg2334xxx  by inhibiting responses to menthol in a
concentration-dependent manner ( xxxg2334xxx  currents in response to
100 am menthol are reported to be reduced ¨50% by 0.5% ethanol
(weil et al., 2005). however,  xxxg2334xxx  activated by cold (or
menthol) was not inhibited by solutions containing 0.5% ethanol in
the present study (fig. 3c). flipr experiments revealed cinnamaldehyde blocked the menthol-induced activation of  xxxg2334xxx 
with an ic50 of 1.5 mm (95% ci: 0.8 – 2.8 mm) (fig. 3d; green
symbols). menthol and cold activate  xxxg2334xxx  by shifting the
voltage dependence of activation to more negative potentials
(voets et al., 2004; nilius et al., 2005). since activators of  xxxg2334xxx 
shift the v1/2 to the left, we tested whether inhibitors of the channel
could shift the v1/2 for channel activation to the right, effectively
making the channel more difficult to open at physiological
voltages. indeed, application of 1 mm cinnamaldehyde at 16-c,

shifted the v1/2 of  xxxg2334xxx  from +5 mv to +65 mv (fig 3e, n = 3).
the effect was partially reversible. steady-state currents evoked at
28-c were also consistent with a rightward shift in voltage
dependence (n = 2, data not shown). these studies show that
cinnamaldehyde activates  xxxg2336xxx  and inhibits  xxxg2334xxx , in addition
to activating trpa1.
perhaps the most specific of sensory compounds is thought to
be capsaicin. nociceptive behavior induced by intraplantar
injection of 0.3 – 0.6 mm capsaicin is abolished in trpv1
knockout mice, suggesting it is the sole  xxxg2335xxx 
(caterina et al., 2000; davis et al., 2000). we find that
concentrations of up to 0.5 mm capsaicin are specific to trpv1.
higher concentrations of capsaicin (1 mm) appeared to inhibit
 xxxg2336xxx  (camphor and heat responses) and  xxxg2334xxx  (cold and
menthol responses) and activate trpa1. however, 1 mm capsaicin
also induced large fluorescence increases in non-transfected cho
cells and diminished atp responses, so it is unlikely the effects on
these other thermotrps were specific (data not shown).

discussion
this study highlights a complex, tangled relationship of sensory
compounds to thermotrps, and raises questions on the evolution
of this relationship. we began by reexamining the specificity of
 xxxg2334xxx  activation by menthol, a natural compound with paradoxical sensory effects. although the sensation of menthol is primarily
one of ‘‘cool,’’ it also heightens warmth sensation (green, 1985).
here, we show that the complexity of menthol sensations may be
explained via receptor-based mechanisms. we demonstrate that
menthol acts on a total of three thermotrps: cool-activated
trmp8, warm-activated  xxxg2336xxx  and trpa1, a thermotrp
activated by noxious cold and pungent/burning compounds. at
warm temperatures menthol might be interpreted as warm based on
its sensitizing effect on  xxxg2336xxx , while at cooler temperatures, its
activation of  xxxg2334xxx  dominates its sensory quality. although this
seems to be the most parsimonious explanation of the data, it is a
difficult model to prove. first, the effects of menthol on warming
in human subjects have been examined in only a few studies with
small sample size (green, 1985; hatem et al., 2006). furthermore,
menthol may activate other pathways to produce this warm
sensation. finally, millimolar amounts of menthol are required to
activate  xxxg2336xxx . although similar and higher concentrations of
menthol are used in over the counter medication, penetration issues

cinnamaldehyde and 37-c heat elicit  xxxg2336xxx  currents. whole-cell currents

could limit actual concentration (but see below). on the other hand,
submillimolar menthol is able to block trpa1. the ic50 for
menthol inhibition of trpa1 is 68 am, a relatively low
concentration compared to the concentrations used in pain rubs
and not qualitatively different from menthol’s ability to activate
 xxxg2334xxx  (ec50 30 am). therefore, menthol’s analgesic action
could be based on  xxxg2334xxx  activation, and/or inhibition of painsensing trpa1.
to further investigate thermotrp-mediated mechanisms of the
complexity of sensory compounds, we performed a ‘‘4  4’’
analysis of the specificity of menthol, camphor, cinnamaldehyde
and capsaicin against  xxxg2336xxx , trpa1, trpv1 and  xxxg2334xxx  (in
order of our analyses, table 1). for each compound-channel
pairing, we investigated both agonistic and antagonistic effects
with complete concentration dependence, when possible. for all
pairing relationships (32 in total), we found only one instance of
selectivity—in all cases, with the exception of capsaicin activation
of trpv1, the thermotrps were either activated or inhibited by
more than one of the compounds we studied. menthol, camphor
and cinnamaldehyde each activated/inhibited a total of three of the
four thermotrps tested (table 1).  xxxg2336xxx  and trpa1 appeared to
be the most promiscuous thermotrps, being activated or inhibited
by menthol, camphor and cinnamaldehyde. block of trpa1 by
menthol (a  xxxg2334xxx  agonist), and  xxxg2334xxx  by cinnamaldehyde (a
trpa1 agonist) revealed a reversed agonist/antagonist relationship
between these two cold-activated thermotrps. camphor activated
trpv1 but inhibited trpa1 at notably disparate concentrations—
4.5 mm (ec50) to activate vs. 68 am (ic50) to block, respectively
(xu et al., 2005).
the concentrations of sensory compounds we have utilized to
study specificity are likely to be relevant—they are well below or
within range of the concentrations used in studies of human
subjects and in over-the-counter pain rubs and creams. it is also
likely that the sensory compounds at these concentrations could
penetrate the skin to act on the thermotrp receptors. transdermal
absorption has been studied to determine the efficacy and safety of
delivery by patches, which contain high concentrations of several
sensory compounds (and drugs). low but detectable levels of
menthol and camphor were detected in the plasma of human
subjects who applied such patches to their skin (martin et al.,
2004). in addition, 2% (¨100 mm) menthol acts as a penetration
enhancer in drug delivery studies, suggesting it not only permeates
the epidermis well but also acts to increase the accessibility of
other molecules (yener et al., 2003; kanikkannan et al., 2004).
however, actual concentrations of these sensory compounds at
keratinocytes and nerve endings could not be calculated at this
time. it is therefore possible that some of the sensory compoundthermotrp relationships we have discovered are relevant (e.g.,
68 am ic50 of camphor and menthol to trpa1) while others are
not. nevertheless, all the findings are important as pharmacological
tools. the overall promiscuity of sensory compounds shown here
suggests caution when using such molecules as specific pharmacological agents.
mechanistically, little is known about how sensory compounds
activate thermotrps. with the exception of capsaicin and more
recently menthol, none of the structural elements required for
activation of thermotrps by the compounds tested in this study
are known (jordt and julius, 2002; bandell et al., 2006). further
study is needed to determine the mechanisms of ‘‘cross-talk’’
among these sensory compounds and thermotrps. it is notable
that the concentration dependence of menthol and camphor to

341

either activate  xxxg2336xxx  (each in the mid-mm range) or to block
trpa1 (each ¨70 am) are similar. these compounds may interact
at the same binding sites to directly activate  xxxg2336xxx  or competitively inhibit trpa1. this may also explain the reversed
agonist/antagonist relationship of menthol and cinnamaldehyde on
 xxxg2334xxx  and trpa1 as well as the ability of cinnamaldehyde to
activate  xxxg2336xxx . we show here that cinnamaldehyde can shift the
v1/2 of  xxxg2334xxx  to the right, opposing the leftward shift of voltage
due to cold temperatures. while voltage modulation by temperature and compounds is well documented for trpv1 and  xxxg2334xxx ,
and may be true for  xxxg2336xxx , a compound/temperature/voltage
relationship with trpa1 has yet to be investigated (brauchi et al.,
2004; voets et al., 2004; chung et al., 2005; xu et al., 2005).
therefore, voltage modulation could be the central mechanism
explaining the activity of these sensory compounds on thermotrps. alternatively, it is possible that the effect of menthol and
other sensory compounds on thermotrps is indirect, through
modification of membrane structure, binding to other receptors, or
activating second messengers.

experimental methods
cho cell, drg neuron, and primary keratinocyte culture
chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells were transiently transfected with
plasmids encoding rtrpv1 (rat), mtrpa1 (mouse), mtrpm8, and
mtrpv3 using fugene transfection reagent (roche). cells were cotransfected with a pcdna3-based (invitrogen) yfp marker plasmid.
negative control cells were transfected with yfp alone. stable cell lines
expressing mtrpm8, mtrpa1 and rtrpv1 were used in some studies as
previously described (story et al., 2003). adult mouse drg culture was
carried out according to our previous protocol (bandell et al., 2004).
primary culture of newborn mouse keratinocytes was performed according
to our previous protocol (moqrich et al., 2005). for the menthol
experiments on primary keratinocytes, warm calcium imaging buffer
(33-c) was perfused over the cells. 1 mm menthol was applied in the
warm using 2  1 min pulses separated by 3 min of buffer washout. as a
positive control for  xxxg2336xxx  expression, cells were then cooled to 26-c, then
1 mm camphor + 50 am 2-apb was applied for 1 min which produces a
maximal  xxxg2336xxx  response. after 2 min of washout, 100 am atp was
applied at 26-c for 1 min.
calcium imaging and electrophysiology
after 24 – 72 h, transiently transfected yfp-expressing cho cells were
selected for calcium imaging or electrophysiology experiments. intracellular calcium imaging experiments were performed by washing cells three
times with calcium imaging buffer (1 hanks’  xxxd2988xxx 
supplemented with 10 mm hepes), then loaded with ratiometric calcium
indicator dye fura-2 (molecular probes) up to 1 h, according to product
information. cells were washed three times and incubated at room
temperature for 15 – 30 min prior to imaging. for whole-cell recordings, a
voltage ramp protocol was used with a sampling interval of 400 as/channel
(2.5 khz), holding at 60 mv for 250 ms, then ramping from 80 mv to
+80 mv over 325 ms, returning to 60 mv for 250 ms after the ramp.
ramps were taken with an inter-sweep interval of 3 s. for some drg
neuron experiments, a voltage clamp (at 60 mv) was used. unless
otherwise indicated, recordings were performed at room temperature. the
regular pipette solution in the whole-cell experiments was (in mm) cscl,
140; egta, 5; hepes, 10; mgatp, 1; titrated to ph 7.4 with csoh. for
 xxxg2334xxx , the extracellular solution contained (in mm) nacl 140; egta, 5;
hepes, 10; and mgcl2, 2. this extracellular solution was the same for
other experiments with the following exceptions: for  xxxg2336xxx , 5 mm kcl
was added, for trpv1, 2 mm cacl2 and 5 mm kcl was added, and for

342

l.j. macpherson et al. / mol. cell. neurosci. 32 (2006) 335 – 343

trpa1, 0.5 mm cacl2 was added to the extracellular solution. for
determination of steady-state iv and v1/2 of  xxxg2334xxx , cells were challenged
with a family of 100-ms duration voltage steps stepping from 120 mv to
+200 mv in 20-mv intervals, followed by a step to +50 mv for 100 ms to
measure tail currents. the holding potential was 0 mv. an inter-sweep
interval of 10 s was used to ensure complete channel closure between
sweeps. v1/2 determinations were obtained using the boltzmann function to
fit g/gmax vs. voltage curves derived from tail current analyses.
flipr (fluorescence imaging plate reader)
for flipr (molecular devices) determination of ec50 dose response
curves, transiently transfected hek cells were used for rtrpv1, mtrpv3,
and mtrpm8 (fugene—roche). mtrpm8 stable cho and tet-inducible
cho cell lines expressing mtrpa1 were also used for flipr determinations of ic50. cells were washed with assay buffer (1 hanks’ balanced
salt solution supplemented with 20 mm hepes and 2.5 mm probenecid)
and then loaded with fluo-3 (molecular probes) dye according to protocol.
concentration dependence was obtained from 7 to 12 point determinations.
compounds menthol and cinnamaldehyde were dissolved in ethanol as 4 m
stocks and serially diluted (1:2) in assay buffer from 40.96 mm in
polypropylene 384-well compound plates to 2-fold the final concentration
(20 am to 40.96 mm). cinnamaldehyde and menthol were soluble in assay
buffer at 40.96 mm after gentle heating. camphor was dissolved in ethanol
as a 2 m stock. camphor was sparingly soluble at 20.48 mm after heating.
the maximum final ethanol concentration was 0.5% for all compounds.
vehicle controls and untransfected cho/hek cells were included on the
plate. for determination of the ic50 for compounds on  xxxg2334xxx  and trpa1,
cells were challenged on line with inhibitor for 1 min prior to the application
of activator compound and inhibitor, keeping the concentration of inhibitor
constant. cinnamaldehyde (75 am) and menthol (75 am) (final concentration) were used to activate trpa1 and  xxxg2334xxx , respectively. fluorescence
readings were acquired at 1 hz for 1 min prior to inhibitor addition for
baseline, 1 min after inhibitor addition (secondary baseline), and 3 min after
agonist addition. dose response curves were fit using prism (graphpad)
software using a nonlinear regression model. ec50, ic50 and 95%
confidence intervals (95% ci) were calculated from these curves.
compounds
menthol, camphor, cinnamaldehyde, 2-apb, and atp were purchased
from sigma-aldrich. capsaicin was purchased from fluka. stock solutions
for menthol, camphor and cinnamaldehyde were made using ethanol;
capsaicin and atp were dissolved with dmso. all compounds were
diluted with test solutions before use.
