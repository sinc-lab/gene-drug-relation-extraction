although m2 receptors outnumber m3 receptors by a ratio of
3:1 and 4:1 in bladder and gastrointestinal tract smooth muscle,
respectively, in vitro studies suggest that m3 receptors are
primarily responsible for mediating the excitatory effects of
acetylcholine in both organs (1, 17). muscarinic m1 receptors

inhibit acetylcholine release from nerve terminals (14, 20, 24,
30). thus the net gastrointestinal effects of nonspecific muscarinic antagonists on gastrointestinal motor activity likely
reflect a balance between excitatory and inhibitory effects.
however, although muscarinic antagonists are widely used to
treat gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., abdominal cramping and
diarrhea) and an overactive bladder, the relative contribution of
muscarinic receptor subtypes to normal gastrointestinal motor
functions in humans has not been studied. this question is
important since the magnitude of antimuscarinic effects and
muscarinic receptor selectivity for various muscarinic antagonists are organ and species specific (2, 8).
in clinical trials of patients with an overactive bladder, the
incidence of constipation is higher with m3 selective muscarinic antagonists, for example trospium chloride (10.9 vs. 5.8%
for placebo) (26) and  xxxd1813xxx  [14.8% (7.5 mg daily) and
21.3% (15 mg daily) vs. 6.2% (placebo)] (9) than with nonspecific antagonists, e.g.,  xxxd3398xxx  (7%) vs. placebo (4%)
(33). these observations suggest that m3-selective muscarinic
antagonists have more pronounced effects than nonspecific
antagonists on gastrointestinal motor activity in humans. thus
our hypothesis was that a muscarinic m3-selective but not the
muscarinic nonspecific receptor antagonist  xxxd3398xxx  would
delay gastrointestinal and colonic transit in healthy subjects.
methods

healthy subjects. seventy-two healthy volunteers aged 19 to 58 yr
old (mean age, 35 yr; 24 men and 48 women) were recruited by public
advertisement. none had an underlying illnesses or previous gastrointestinal surgery (other than appendectomy or cholecystectomy) or
used medications other than oral contraceptives and thyroid hormone
replacement therapy. functional gastrointestinal disorders, anxiety,
and depression were excluded by validated screening questionnaires,
a clinical interview, and a physical examination (5, 36). seventy
subjects completed the study. of the two remaining subjects, one had
medication-related anticholinergic side effects, and logistical constraints precluded participation in another subject.
drug. subjects were randomly assigned, stratified by sex and age
(i.e., ⬍ and ⱖ50 yr), to placebo (n ⫽ 16),  xxxd1813xxx  7.5 mg extended
release (er) (n ⫽ 20),  xxxd1813xxx  15 mg er (n ⫽ 17), or  xxxd3398xxx 
4 mg long aching (n ⫽ 19), administered once daily for 6 days.
 xxxd3398xxx  is a competitive nonspecific muscarinic receptor antagonist whereas  xxxd1813xxx  is an m3-selective receptor antagonist. these
doses are approved by the food and drug administration for treating
urinary symptoms. medication compliance was assessed both by the
return of an empty pill bottle at the conclusion of the study and by
recording the time the medication was taken in the bowel diary.
after oral administration, both  xxxd3398xxx  and  xxxd1813xxx  are
effectively absorbed, highly bound to plasma proteins, and extensively metabolized by cyp2d6 in the liver.  xxxd3398xxx  is initially
metabolized to the pharmacologically active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite, whose antimuscarinic effects are similar to those of  xxxd3398xxx

doi:10.1152/ajpgi.00072.2010.—although in vitro studies show that
muscarinic m3 receptors primarily mediate the effects of acetylcholine on gastrointestinal contractility, the muscarinic receptor subtypes
regulating gastrointestinal motor activity and transit in humans in vivo
are unclear. we hypothesized that muscarinic m3-specific but not
nonspecific receptor antagonists would delay gastrointestinal and
colonic transit in humans. in this parallel-group study, gastric emptying, small intestinal transit, and colonic transit were assessed by
scintigraphy on days 4-6 in 72 healthy subjects (49 women) who
received placebo (n ⫽ 16), the m3 antagonist  xxxd1813xxx  er [7.5 mg
(n ⫽ 20) or 15 mg daily (n ⫽ 17)], or the nonspecific antagonist
 xxxd3398xxx  [4 mg daily (n ⫽ 19)] for 6 days. bowel habits were
recorded by daily diaries. both doses of  xxxd1813xxx  substantially
delayed [p ⬍ 0.01 vs. placebo (for both doses), p ⬍ 0.01 vs.
 xxxd3398xxx  (for 15 mg)] small intestinal transit, i.e., colonic filling at
6 h (placebo [59.6 ⫾ 6.4%, mean ⫾ se], 7.5 mg er [34.4 ⫾ 6.1%],
15 mg er [20.4 ⫾ 6.3%)].  xxxd1813xxx  (15 mg) also delayed (p ⬍
0.01 vs. placebo and  xxxd3398xxx ) half-time for ascending colonic
emptying [placebo (12.0 ⫾ 1.5 h), 7.5 mg (18.6 ⫾ 1.9 h), 15 mg (22.9 ⫾
2.6 h)] and colonic transit (geometric center) at 24 [placebo (2.8 ⫾
0.2), 7.5 mg (2.4 ⫾ 0.2), 15 mg (1.9 ⫾ 0.2)] but not 48 h.  xxxd1813xxx 
did not affect gastric emptying and  xxxd3398xxx  did not affect bowel
habits or gastrointestinal transit. with muscarinic antagonists used at
clinically approved doses, these findings demonstrate that muscarinic
m3 receptors regulate small intestinal and colonic transit in humans;
colonic effects are more pronounced in the right than left colon. at
doses that affect small and large intestinal transit, m3 antagonists do
not affect gastric emptying in humans. the efficacy of  xxxd1813xxx  in
diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome should be evaluated.

results

subject characteristics. seventy of 72 subjects completed
the study. data were imputed for two subjects (both  xxxd1813xxx  7.5 mg) who dropped out prior to the transit study.
consistent with the stratified randomization, the age and sex
were evenly distributed among groups (table 1). the body
mass index (bmi) was also not significantly different among
groups.
effects on gastrointestinal transit. neither  xxxd3398xxx  nor
 xxxd1813xxx  had significant effects on gastric emptying (table 2)
compared with placebo, both doses of  xxxd1813xxx  delayed
small bowel transit (p ⬍ 0.01); the higher dose also delayed
(p ⱕ 0.0001) ascending colonic emptying and colonic transit at
24 h (gc24) but not at 48 h (gc48). the higher dose of
 xxxd1813xxx  (15 mg) also delayed (p ⫽ 0.003) small bowel and
colonic transit (gc24) and the ascending colonic emptying thalf
vs.  xxxd3398xxx  (table 2). in contrast,  xxxd3398xxx  did not significantly affect gastric emptying or small intestinal or colonic
transit (table 2, fig. 1).
the effects on gastrointestinal and colonic transit parameters
were correlated. the thalf for ascending colonic emptying was
inversely correlated with colonic filling at 6 h (r ⫽ ⫺0.46, p ⬍
0.0001), gc24 (r ⫽ ⫺0.81, p ⬍ 0.0001), and gc48 (r ⫽
⫺0.53, p ⬍ 0.0001), implying that a longer ascending colonic
emptying time was associated with less colonic filling at 6 h
(i.e., slower small intestinal transit) and with slower colonic
transit at 24 and 48 h.
gastric emptying and colonic transit were slower (p ⬍ 0.01)
in women. the effects of sex were not modified by treatment,
i.e., the sex-by-treatment interaction was not significant. thus
the thalf for gastric emptying was 133 ⫾ 4 (means ⫾ se) min
in women and 111 ⫾ 6 min in men. the gc48 for colonic
transit was lower, reflecting slower colonic transit, in women
(i.e., 3.8 ⫾ 0.1) than in men (i.e., 4.0 ⫾ 0.2).
effects on bowel habits. the bristol stool form scale score
was lower (p ⬍ 0.01), reflecting harder stools, in subjects who

assessments. gastric emptying, small intestinal transit, and colonic
transit were assessed by established and validated scintigraphic techniques on days 4–6 after starting medication (11). gastric emptying
and small bowel transit were measured by a 99mtc-labeled egg meal.
colonic transit was measured by 111in-labeled charcoal pellets within
a capsule coated by methacrylate. gastric emptying was summarized
as the proportion of stomach contents emptied at 2 and at 4 h and by
the half-time for gastric emptying. colonic filling (i.e., the proportion
of 99mtc reaching the colon) at 6 h was used to measure orocecal
transit (i.e., a surrogate for small bowel transit). colonic filling is
expressed by measuring the proportion of total 99mtc counts at 6 h,
corrected for decay and tissue attenuation, which are in the colon,
typically in the cecum and ascending colon. overall colonic transit
was summarized as the colonic geometric center (gc) at 4, 24, and 48
h. the gc represents the average of counts in different colonic
regions (ascending, transverse, descending, and rectosigmoid colon)
and stool, weighted by factors of 1 to 5, respectively, at these time
points. therefore, a higher gc represents faster colonic transit.
ascending colonic emptying was summarized by the half-time (thalf)
calculated by linear interpolation of values on the ascending colonic
emptying curve. for 6 days before and 6 days after beginning
medication, subjects also recorded stool form (bristol stool scale),
completeness of evacuation (yes/no), and ease of defecation (1 being
manual disimpaction to 7 being incontinence of stool) for every bowel
movement in a bowel diary.
statistical analysis. the primary end point was colonic transit as
measured by the gc at 24 h (gc24). secondary end points included
the thalf for gastric emptying, colonic filling at 6 h, which is a measure
of small intestinal transit, gc of colonic transit at 48 h (gc48), and
effects on bowel habits (i.e., stool frequency, form, ease of passage,
and incomplete evacuation). data were analyzed by an analysis of
covariance incorporating sex as a covariate along with the main effect
term for treatment group. analysis of posttreatment bowel diaries
incorporated baseline symptom scores as covariates. since the interaction term (sex by treatment) was not significant, the reported results
are based on the main effects models. to accommodate an intent-totreat analysis, subjects with missing data on any end point had their
missing values imputed by using the overall mean in subjects with
data for that end point. a corresponding adjustment in the residual
error degrees of freedom was made by subtracting one degree of

freedom for each missing value imputed for a given end point. the
analysis incorporated bonferroni corrections for three comparisons
with placebo (i.e., 2 doses of  xxxd1813xxx  and 1 dose of  xxxd3398xxx )
and two comparisons among drugs (i.e.,  xxxd3398xxx  vs. each of 2
doses of  xxxd1813xxx ).
the effect of  xxxd1813xxx  on colonic transit in humans is unknown.
therefore, the sample size was estimated from the pooled distribution
of colonic transit (i.e., gc24) in healthy subjects in previous studies
wherein the mean gc24 was 2.75 and the sd was 1.0. with a sample
size of 18 subjects per group, this study had 80% power (with a
two-sample t-test and two-sided alpha level of 0.05) to identify a
difference of 1.0 unit in the gc24 between any two drugs. differences
greater than one unit are considered to be clinically relevant (16, 34).

discussion

although muscarinic antagonists have been demonstrated to
inhibit contractility and are often used to treat abdominal pain
and diarrhea, their effects on gastrointestinal transit in humans
are poorly understood. this is the first controlled study to
compare the effects of nonspecific and relatively selective m3
receptor antagonists on gastrointestinal transit in humans. a
lower dose of  xxxd1813xxx  delayed small intestinal transit
whereas a higher dose also delayed ascending colonic emptying and colonic transit, demonstrating that muscarinic m3
receptors regulate small intestinal and colonic transit in
humans.  xxxd1813xxx  delayed gc24 and ascending colonic
emptying but not gc48, suggesting a more pronounced
effect on right than left colonic motor functions. in contrast
to  xxxd1813xxx ,  xxxd3398xxx , which has a comparable affinity
for all five muscarinic receptors in the urinary bladder, did
not delay gastrointestinal or colonic transit, confirming a
previous study (3).
the observed effects of  xxxd1813xxx  are consistent with in
vitro and in vivo studies in animals, suggesting that muscarinic
receptor antagonists inhibit peristalsis and that, among muscarinic receptors, the m3 subtype is primarily responsible for
regulating gastrointestinal motility (15). there are three poten-

tial explanations for why  xxxd1813xxx  but not  xxxd3398xxx  delayed small intestinal and colonic transit. first,  xxxd1813xxx  is a
more potent competitive antagonist than  xxxd3398xxx  at m3
receptors (15). second,  xxxd3398xxx  may offset the effects of
antagonizing excitatory receptors by also blocking the inhibitory effects of muscarinic stimulation on motility, either by
blocking presynaptic muscarinic receptors that inhibit acetylcholine release, which are of the m1, m2, or m4 variety (14, 20,
30), or by blocking m1 receptors on nonadrenergic-noncholinergic inhibitory pathways (13, 27). in the human colon, m2
receptors are located presynaptically on nerve fibers, suggesting they autoregulate acetylcholine release (18). indeed, the m1
antagonist  xxxd2965xxx  facilitated peristalsis in the guinea pig
small intestine, perhaps by withdrawing tonic m1 receptormediated inhibition of acetylcholine release from circular muscle (14, 28). third,  xxxd3398xxx  binds relatively selectively to
muscarinic receptors in the urinary bladder (23). perhaps this
also explains why atropine, which is also a nonspecific muscarinic antagonist but in contrast to  xxxd3398xxx  binds to colonic
muscarinic receptors, delays orocecal and colonic transit in
humans and dogs, respectively (6, 10). atropine also has a
higher affinity for m3 than for m2 receptors (15).
in the stomach, m3 receptors are located not only on gastric
smooth muscle but also increase pacemaker frequency via
effects on interstitial cells of cajal in the murine gastric fundus
and antrum (21). atropine reduced antral motor activity and
delayed gastric emptying in humans (25, 35). in contrast,
neither  xxxd3398xxx  nor  xxxd1813xxx  delayed gastric emptying,
suggesting perhaps that compensatory mechanisms preserve
gastric emptying despite antagonism of m3 receptors, as exemplified by the observation that contractile responses to
carbachol but not gastric emptying were inhibited in muscarinic m2 and separately m3 knockout mice (22).

the effects of  xxxd1813xxx  (15 mg) on intestinal and colonic
transit may be clinically relevant.  xxxd1813xxx  also significantly
reduced stool consistency compared with  xxxd3398xxx ; stool
characteristics (i.e., consistency, frequency, and ease of passage) were significantly correlated with colonic transit as
shown previously (3). the magnitude by which  xxxd1813xxx 
delayed small intestinal and colonic transit is, respectively,
comparable to and lower than the effect of codeine (30 mg po
qid) on these parameters (16). in contrast to codeine, both
doses of  xxxd1813xxx  delayed ascending colonic emptying compared with placebo. current concepts, based on limited data,
suggest that patients with chronic constipation who have delayed ascending and transverse colonic emptying also have
delayed overall colonic transit (29). however, larger studies
are necessary to evaluate whether a subset of patients with
chronic constipation have an isolated delay in right colonic
emptying.
the effects of  xxxd1813xxx  on gastrointestinal transit are
germane since urinary urgency is associated with functional
constipation (4). from a therapeutic perspective, the effects of
 xxxd1813xxx  on symptoms and gastrointestinal transit in irritable
bowel syndrome (ibs), which can be associated with rapid
transit, are worthy of further study (7). the  xxxd1813xxx -induced delay in intestinal and colonic transit in this study is
more pronounced than the effects of alosetron in patients with
diarrhea-predominant ibs (31). indeed, zamifenacin, which is
also a relatively selective m3 antagonist, reduced the postprandial colonic contractile response in ibs (19).
in summary, these findings, using muscarinic antagonists at
clinically approved doses, demonstrate that muscarinic m3
receptors mediate the excitatory effects of acetylcholine on
small intestinal and colonic transit in humans. these effects are
potentially clinically significant and more pronounced on the
right than the left colon. at doses that affect small and large
intestinal transit, m3 antagonists do not affect gastric emptying
in humans. further studies evaluating the effects of  xxxd1813xxx 
on gastrointestinal and colonic transit in patients with urinary
urgency and in diarrhea-predominant ibs are necessary.
