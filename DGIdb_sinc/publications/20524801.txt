the administration of most  xxxg36xxx  inhibitors (aceis) and
angiotensin receptor blockers (arbs) at bedtime results in a greater reduction of
nighttime blood pressure (bp) than dosing upon awakening. it has been proposed that
this effect may be a consequence of a short half-life and duration of action. however,
those findings were also documented for long-acting medications, such as the arb
 xxxd3303xxx . accordingly, we investigated the administration-time-dependent effects on
ambulatory bp of  xxxd3237xxx , an acei with an elimination half-life of about 40 h. we
studied 165 previously untreated hypertensive subjects, 42.5 ± 13.9 yrs of age, treated
with  xxxd3237xxx  (6 mg/day) as monotherapy for 12 weeks either upon awakening or at
bedtime. bp was measured by ambulatory monitoring for 48 h before and after treatment. the bp reduction during diurnal activity was similar for both treatment times.
bedtime  xxxd3237xxx  administration, however, was significantly more efficient than
morning administration in reducing asleep bp. the awake/asleep bp ratio was
decreased with the upon-awakening  xxxd3237xxx  treatment schedule but significantly
increased toward a more dipping pattern with the bedtime treatment schedule. the
proportion of patients with controlled ambulatory bp increased from 23 to 59% ( p <
0.001) with bedtime treatment. sleep-time bp regulation is significantly better
achieved with bedtime  xxxd3237xxx  administration. this might be clinically important, as
the sleep-time bp mean has been shown to be a more relevant marker of

introduction
clinical studies have consistently documented differences in the blood
pressure (bp)-lowering efficacy, duration of action, and effects on the circadian bp pattern depending on the administration time of medications
that interact with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas)
(hermida et al., 2007a). independent randomized trials have demonstrated a different effect of  xxxg36xxx  inhibitors
(aceis), including benazepril, enalapril, imidapril, perindopril,  xxxd3063xxx , ramipril, and  xxxd3409xxx , when scheduled in the morning versus
the evening (hermida et al., 2007a; ohmori & fujimura, 2005). evening
administration of these medications resulted in a higher efficacy qualified
in terms of the reduction of the sleep-time bp and significant modification (i.e., in the direction of normalization) of the circadian bp profile
toward a more dipping pattern (hermida et al., 2007a). some authors
have proposed that these differential administration-time-dependent
effects of aceis may be just a direct consequence of a short half-life and
duration of action of these medications, and that the time of treatment
might be relevant only for short half-life acei and angiotensin receptor
blocker (arb) medications (morgan, 2009).
a recent study (hermida & ayala, 2009), however, has shown marked
differences in the bp-lowering effects of awakening versus bedtime
administration of 5 mg/day ramipril, a dose providing full 24 h coverage
(lacourcière et al., 2006). most important, we have previously documented a significant change in the dose-response curve, increased proportion
of controlled patients, and improved efficacy on the asleep bp mean
when the long-acting arb  xxxd3303xxx  was ingested at bedtime, as compared to awakening, in subjects with essential hypertension (hermida
et al., 2007b). similar administration-time-dependent effects on ambulatory bp—namely, a more efficient bp control during sleep without any
loss in efficacy during the daytime active hours with bedtime versus
morning dosing—were also documented for  xxxd3487xxx  (hermida et al.,
2003) and olmesartan (hermida et al., 2009), arb medications with
differing half-lives but all providing bp-lowering efficacy beyond 24 h
after the last dose, as shown by clinical studies involving ambulatory bp
monitoring (abpm) (hermida et al., 2008, 2009; neutel et al., 2002).

 xxxd3237xxx  is a relatively new acei that reaches maximal plasma concentration within 2–3 h after oral ingestion in the morning. however,
comparative studies on the pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics
of  xxxd3237xxx  depending of the time of ingestion are lacking.  xxxd3237xxx  has
been recommended for once-daily administration because of its protracted duration of action as a result of its long elimination half-life of
∼40 h (düsing & müller, 2003; hayduk & kraul, 1999). in view of the
collective findings of administration-time-dependencies of acei and arb
medications, this prospective trial was designed to compare, based on
48 h abpm studies, the antihypertensive efficacy of the long-acting acei
 xxxd3237xxx  when ingested as a monotherapy either upon awakening or at
bedtime for 12 weeks by previously untreated subjects with uncomplicated essential hypertension.
methods
inclusion and exclusion criteria
inclusion criteria were age ≥18 yrs and a diagnosis of previously
untreated grade 1–2 uncomplicated essential hypertension based on the
criteria of the european society of hypertension-european society of
cardiology (mancia et al., 2007), as determined by repeated (within the
three months previous to recruitment) conventional clinic bp measurements (systolic bp [sbp] 140–179 mmhg and/or diastolic bp [dbp]
90–109 mmhg), and corroborated by 48 h abpm at the time of recruitment. the diagnosis of hypertension based on 48 h abpm required an
awake bp mean of ≥135/85 mmhg or an asleep bp mean ≥120/
70 mmhg (mancia et al., 2007). exclusion criteria were pregnancy,
shiftworking, heavy alcohol intake (>80 g/day), heavy smoking (>20
cigarette/d), and heavy exercising. also excluded were individuals with
either severe arterial hypertension (grade 3, bp ≥180/110 mmhg), type
1 diabetes, or secondary arterial hypertension and cardiovascular disorders, including concomitant unstable angina pectoris, heart failure,
stroke, life-threatening arrhythmia, nephropathy, retinopathy, or prior
(within the last year) myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization.
study design
this was an open-label, parallel-group, blinded-endpoint (changes in
ambulatory bp) study. we screened 194 subjects, all with a daytime
activity and nocturnal sleep routine, and identified 170 who met the
inclusion/exclusion criteria. among these, 165 (65 men/100 women,
42.5 ± 13.9 [mean ± sd] yrs of age) completed the study and provided
all required information for the trial. the subjects were participants in a

chronotherapy with  xxxd3237xxx 

563

larger prospective study (www.clinicaltrials.gov, code nct00295542)
(hermida, 2007) approved by the ethics committee of clinical research.
the study respected the criteria set forth for ethical medical research as
outlined in the helsinki declaration and the journal (portaluppi et al.,
2008). all subjects gave written informed consent.
subjects were assigned to one of two groups specific to the time-ofday, either in the morning upon awakening or at bedtime, of once-daily
 xxxd3237xxx  treatment in a dose of 6 mg/day (the only approved and recommended dose in spain) for 12 weeks. at each of the two visits to the
medical setting, before and after 12 weeks of therapy, respectively, six
clinic bp measurements were obtained, after the subject had rested in a
seated position for ≥10 min, using a validated automatic oscillometric
device (hem-705it, omron health care inc., vernon hills, illinois,
usa).
abpm assessment
the sbp, dbp, and heart rate (hr) of each participant were automatically measured every 20 min from 07:00 to 23:00 h and every 30 min
during the night for 48 consecutive hours, before and after timed
therapy, with a properly calibrated spacelabs 90207 bp monitor
(spacelabs inc., issaquah, washington, usa). participants were
instructed to adhere to their usual activities with minimal restrictions but
to follow a similar schedule during the two days of abpm and to avoid
daytime napping.
bp series were not considered valid for analysis if >30% of the
measurements were missing, if data were missing for an interval of >2 h,
if data were obtained while subjects had an irregular rest-activity schedule
during the two days of monitoring, or if the nighttime sleep period was
<6 h or >12 h during abpm. protocol-correct data series were collected
at baseline and after treatment from 165 subjects and were therefore
included in this efficacy study. baseline bp profiles of five additional subjects (two originally assigned to  xxxd3237xxx  upon awakening and three at
bedtime) were eliminated due to the absence of follow-up bp profiles
because of their failure to return for the second post-treatment abpm.
no one withdrew from the trial due to adverse effects.
actigraphy
all subjects wore an actigraph (mini-motion-logger, ambulatory
monitoring inc., ardsley, new york, usa) on the dominant wrist to
monitor physical activity every min during both abpm sessions. this
compact (about half the size of a wristwatch) device works as an accelerometer. we synchronized the internal clocks of the actigraph and the

564

r. c. hermida et al.

abpm device through their respective interfaces using the same computer. the actigraphy data were used to determine the beginning and end
of daytime activity and nocturnal sleep so the awake and asleep bp
means for each subject could be accurately determined.
statistical methods
assuming a sd of 8.0 mmhg for mean bp and with 80 subjects per
timed-treatment arm, the study could achieve ∼90% power to show as
significant at a 95% level differences in efficacy of 4 mmhg in the awake
or sleep-time bp means between the two treatment groups.
each individual’s clock hour bp and hr values were first referenced
to time after awakening from nocturnal sleep, based on data obtained by
wrist actigraphy. this transformation avoided the introduction of bias
due to differences among subjects in the exact clock times of their sleep/
activity routine. thus, the timing of the bp and hr measurement is
expressed as a function of proper circadian time (here referred to the
24 h rest-activity cycle) instead of meaningless clock hour. to correct for
measurement errors and outliers, bp was edited according to conventional criteria. thus, readings of sbp >250 or <70 mmhg, dbp >150 or
<40 mmhg, and pulse pressure (pp, difference between sbp and dbp)
>150 or <20 mmhg were automatically discarded. for descriptive purposes, the circadian rhythm of bp before and after treatment was objectively assessed by population multiple-component analysis (fernández &
hermida, 1998), a method applicable to nonsinusoidal shaped hybrid
time series (i.e., time series of data collected from a group of subjects),
consisting of values distributed at equal or unequal intervals.
the circadian rhythm parameters of mesor (24 h average value of
the rhythmic function fitted to the data) and overall amplitude (one-half
the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the best
fitted curve by the method of least-squares) obtained for each timedtherapy group at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment were compared
using a paired nonparametric test developed to assess differences in parameters derived from the population multiple-components analysis
(fernández et al., 2004). hourly bp means obtained before and after
treatment were compared by paired t test corrected for multiple testing.
in so doing, the level of significance was established at p ≤ 0.002, after
dividing the usual level of 0.05 by the number of tests (24, one for each
hourly mean) done on the same variable.
both the absolute and relative change from baseline in the awake (bp
values determined while subjects were active), asleep (bp values determined while subjects were asleep), and 24 h mean bp (average of all
values determined by abpm) as well as in the sleep-time relative bp
decline (an index of bp dipping, defined as the % decline in mean bp

during the hours of nocturnal sleep relative to the mean bp during the
hours of daytime activity) were compared among groups by t test. the
demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between groups
by t (quantitative variables) or nonparametric chi2 tests. within-group comparisons of clinical and abpm characteristics before and after treatment
were also performed using a paired t test.
results
demographic characteristics and clinic bp
the demographic characteristics of the two treatment-time groups
were comparable at baseline, and they remained unchanged after treatment. clinic bp measurements, including pp, were significantly reduced
after the 12 weeks of treatment ( p < 0001). dbp was reduced to a significantly larger extent after bedtime dosing of  xxxd3237xxx .
 xxxd3237xxx  upon awakening
figure 1 shows the circadian pattern of sbp (left) and dbp (right)
measured by 48 h abpm before and after 12 weeks of  xxxd3237xxx  ingestion
upon morning awakening. the dark shading along the lower horizontal
axis of the graphs represents the average hours of nocturnal sleep across
the subjects. results did not vary between the two consecutive days of
sampling. therefore, we decided to pool the bp data over an idealized
single 24 h profile to simplify the graphic display of the results.  xxxd3237xxx 
treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction of the 24 h sbp
and dbp means from baseline (-8.6/-7.0 mmhg in sbp/dbp, p < 0.001;
see table 1). after intervention with morning treatment, 23% of the subjects in this group showed controlled bp values by abpm (i.e., values
below the diagnostic thresholds for hypertension outlined above; mancia
et al., 2007). the effects of treatment were almost double on the awake
than on the asleep bp mean when  xxxd3237xxx  was ingested upon awakening
(see table 1). thus, the circadian amplitude of the 24 h bp pattern was
significantly reduced with morning treatment (see figure 1). morning
 xxxd3237xxx  treatment, however, exerted no effect, relative to the baseline
value, on the 24 h hr mean (-1.4 beats/min; p = 0.231).
 xxxd3237xxx  at bedtime
figure 2 shows the 24 h pattern of sbp and dbp before and after
 xxxd3237xxx  when ingested at bedtime. treatment at this time resulted in significant reduction from baseline in the 24 h sbp/dbp means, by -9.7/6.7 mmhg ( p < 0.001; see table 1). according to the diagnostic criteria

established for abpm, 59% of the patients in this group evidenced controlled bp with bedtime treatment. despite the significant effect on bp,
hr remained unchanged after treatment (−0.3 beats/min in the 24 h
hr mean, p = 0.850). bp reduction with treatment at bedtime was statistically significant ( p < 0.001 after correcting for multiple testing) over
all of the 24 hourly intervals, as shown by the asterisks above the lower
horizontal axis in figure 2. the effects of  xxxd3237xxx  treatment at bedtime
were significantly greater on the asleep than on the awake bp mean (see
table 1). accordingly, the circadian amplitude of the 24 h bp pattern was
significantly increased after bedtime treatment ( p < 0.001; see figure 2).

comparison between treatment groups
there was lack of statistically significant differences in ambulatory bp
at baseline between the two treatment-time groups ( p = 0.456 and 0.379
for comparison of 24 h mean sbp and dbp, respectively; see table 1).
after 12 weeks of timed treatment, the efficacy of  xxxd3237xxx  on the awake
bp mean was similar for the two groups, both in absolute as well as in
percent relative change from baseline (see table 1). however, the results

revealed a greater efficacy with bedtime dosing in regulating asleep bp
( p < 0.001 between groups).
these differential treatment-time-dependent effects on nighttime bp
are reflected in changes on the sleep-time relative bp decline or awake/
asleep bp ratio (see table 1). there was a significant ( p < 0.001) increase
of this ratio when  xxxd3237xxx  was consistently ingested at bedtime, and a significant decrease when  xxxd3237xxx  was ingested upon awakening ( p < 0.001
between treatment-time groups; see table 1). the proportion of patients
with a non-dipper bp pattern (awake/asleep sbp ratio <10%) at baseline
was increased after ingestion of  xxxd3237xxx  upon awakening, but the proportion was significantly reduced from 45 to just 18% when  xxxd3237xxx  was
ingested at bedtime ( p < 0.001; see table 1).
the effects of  xxxd3237xxx  on bp as a function of the time of drug ingestion are illustrated in figure 3. this figure shows the efficacy of bp-lowering in terms of the duration in hours from the last timed dose of
 xxxd3237xxx . when scheduled in the morning,  xxxd3237xxx  begins to lose its bplowering efficacy shortly after reaching peak effect (∼3 h after ingestion).
in contrast, when scheduled at bedtime, the maximum bp-lowering
effect of  xxxd3237xxx  is maintained for the initial 8 h after ingestion, thus

showing a greater duration of efficacy compared to morning administration. efficacy was also significantly greater during the last 4 h of the
dosing interval with bedtime administration of  xxxd3237xxx  (see figure 3).

discussion
results of this study indicate that 6 mg/day  xxxd3237xxx  efficiently
reduces bp for the entire 24 h whether consistently ingested once-daily in
the morning upon awakening from nighttime sleep or at bedtime at
night. the bp-lowering effect, however, was greater during the first as
compared to the last 8 h of the dosing interval, mainly when the medication was ingested in the morning (see figure 3).  xxxd3237xxx  dosing upon
awakening and at bedtime showed similar efficacy in reducing the awake
bp mean (see table 1); however, the bp-lowering effect was significantly
lower on the asleep bp mean after morning as compared to bedtime
administration of  xxxd3237xxx . accordingly, there was a significant decrease

in the proportion of non-dipper patients after treatment in the bedtimedosing group. this might be clinically relevant, as non-dipping and
deficient sleep-time bp control have been related to an increase in endorgan injury and cardiovascular events (brotman et al., 2008; ohkubo
et al., 2002; staessen et al., 1999). moreover, independent prospective
studies have also concluded that the nighttime/sleeptime bp is a better
predictor of cardiovascular mortality than the awake or 24 h bp means
(dolan et al., 2005; kikuya et al., 2005; staessen et al., 1999).
the majority of biological processes is controlled by a master (brain)
and peripheral (organ and tissue) clock network (duguay & cermakian,
2009), and accordingly the main steps in the mechanisms regulating bp
are circadian-stage-dependent (portaluppi & smolensky, 2000). thus, it
is not surprising that antihypertensive medications display a circadian
time-dependency in their pharmacokinetics (pk) and pharmacodynamics
(pd) (hermida et al., 2007a). appreciable ingestion-time differences in
the pk of conventional bp-lowering medications are well known. they
result from circadian rhythms in gastric ph and emptying, gastrointestinal motility, biliary function and circulation, liver enzyme activity, and
blood flow to the duodenum, kidney, and other organs, among other
factors (labrecque & beauchamp, 2003). particularly relevant is the circadian pattern in glomerular filtration rate, with a maximum in the
daytime and a minimum at night (koopman et al., 1989). thus, one
might expect  xxxd3237xxx  to be cleared more slowly overnight, potentially
prolonging its duration of action (see figure 3). clinically relevant
dosing-time differences in the pd, both the beneficial and adverse effects,
of bp-lowering medications are also known (hermida et al., 2007a). they
result from the time-dependency in their pk as well as from circadian
rhythms in drug-free fraction, rate-limiting steps of key metabolic processes, receptor number and conformation, and/or second messenger
and signaling pathways (witte & lemmer, 2003).
a number of circadian rhythms play a role in the 24 h bp pattern,
especially those of the raas. for example, a prominent circadian variation has been demonstrated for plasma renin activity, ace, angiotensin
ii, aldosterone, atrial natriuretic peptide, and catecholamines (angeli
et al., 1992; portaluppi & smolensky, 2000), all reflecting the marked circadian structure of the raas. plasma renin activity peaks during nighttime sleep and is lowest in the early afternoon (bartter et al., 1979). this
variation seems to be related to the rest-activity rather than light-dark
cycle. the circadian pattern in renin activity influences those of other
factors integrating the raas, including the circulating levels of  xxxg99xxx  and ii (angeli et al., 1992). plasma aldosterone presents a circadian
pattern with high concentrations at the beginning of daily activity and
low concentrations at the beginning of nocturnal rest. we thus hypothesize that the administration-time-dependent effects of the acei  xxxd3237xxx

on bp here demonstrated might be related to the circadian variation in
the raas, that is, through the inhibition of its expected activation during
the nocturnal sleep span, and not just a consequence of the terminal halflife (beyond 24 h) of this particular medication (hayduk & kraul, 1999).
similar conclusions have been proposed earlier regarding the administration-time-dependent effects on ambulatory bp of  xxxd3303xxx ,  xxxd3487xxx , and olmesartan, arbs characterized by a markedly different
terminal half-life, but all showing greater efficacy and ability to remodel
the circadian bp pattern when administered at bedtime than upon awakening (hermida et al., 2007a).
the potential reduction in cardiovascular risk associated with the normalization of the circadian bp pattern (the increase in sleep-time relative
bp decline, which could lead eventually to conversion from non-dipper
to dipper 24 h bp patterning, possibly through bedtime administration of
an arb or an acei) is still a matter of debate. so far, only one study has
been specifically designed to investigate whether normalizing the circadian bp profile toward a more dipper pattern by the use of timed
therapy reduces cardiovascular risk (hermida, 2007). preliminary findings from this trial, where abpm was repeated periodically (at least
annually) during the on average >5 yrs of follow-up, indicate the probability of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular event-free survival is strongly
correlated with the sleep-time relative bp decline. most important, results
suggest that increasing this abpm parameter toward a more dipper
pattern is associated with decreased cardiovascular risk, while decreasing
the sleep-time relative bp decline is associated with an increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (hermida, 2007). this consideration
seems especially relevant for specific sleep disorder and metabolic syndrome patients (ayala et al., 2009; perez-lloret et al., 2008; portaluppi
et al., 2009)
in the heart outcomes prevention evaluation (hope) study (yusuf
et al., 2000) patients in the active treatment group received the acei
ramipril at bedtime. the authors of a small substudy, in which participants were evaluated with 24 h abpm, concluded that the beneficial
effects (i.e., reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality risk)
might relate to the 8% increase in the sleep-time relative bp decline seen
after bedtime ramipril dosing (svensson et al., 2001). a recent study with
another acei,  xxxd3305xxx , evaluated its time-dependent effect on the
mortality of stroke-prone spontaneous hypertensive rats (nozawa et al.,
2006).  xxxd3305xxx  prolonged the survival rate of the animals. however,
this effect was best with dosing early in the rest span and poorest with
dosing early in the activity span. these results are relevant inasmuch as,
similar to the results found here for  xxxd3237xxx , evening dosing with  xxxd3305xxx  significantly reduced nocturnal (sleep-time) bp to a greater extent
than diurnal bp, thereby increasing the sleep-time relative bp decline

toward a more dipper profile (eguchi et al., 2002). in light of these collective findings, evaluation of the potential decrease in cardiovascular risk
from the proper modeling of the circadian bp profile by the timed
administration of antihypertensive medication (i.e., by the bedtime
dosing of medications that block the raas, such as with  xxxd3237xxx ),
beyond reduction of bp levels, deserves further prospective investigation.
in conclusion, the results of this study on subjects with grade 1–2
uncomplicated essential hypertension treated with the standard 6 mg
daily dose of  xxxd3237xxx  either upon awakening or at bedtime demonstrate
a normalization of the circadian bp profile toward a more dipper pattern
only when  xxxd3237xxx  is administered at bedtime. the change in the doseresponse curve, extended duration of therapeutic action, increased proportion of controlled patients, and improved efficacy on sleep-time bp
with administration of  xxxd3237xxx  at bedtime should be taken into account
when prescribing this acei for treatment of essential hypertension.
