energy metabolism
of tissues with high energy demand like
cardiac and skeletal muscle, brain, retina, and spermatozoa
(l-7). it catalyzes the reversible transfer of the y-phosphoryl
group of atp to creatine (cr) to yield phosphorylcreatine
(pcr) and adp.
in chicken tissues, four different subunit isoforms of ck
are expressed (8-10):  xxxg468xxx  (m standing for muscle),  xxxg467xxx 
(b standing for brain), mi,- and  xxxg470xxx  (mi standing for
mitochondria).
whereas on a subcellular level the former two
are localized in the cytosol, the latter two are found within
the mitochondria.
according
to the pcr circuit model (ll),
mitochondrial
creatine kinase on the outer surface of the
inner mitochondrial
membrane
metabolizes atp, generated
by oxidative
phosphorylation
in the mitochondrial
matrix,
and cr to yield pcr and adp. pcr is thought to be the actual
“high-energy
compound”
diffusing,
within the cells of the
tissues mentioned
above, to places where energy-consuming
reactions take place. at these sites, the cytosolic ck isoenzymes regenerate atp, and the cr thereby produced diffuses
back to the mitochondria.
already in the 1960s it was proven that the cytosolic ck
isoenzymes are dimeric molecules with a molecular
mass of
80-85 kda (12-18). in agar and starch gel electrophoresis
experiments,
a urea-denatured
and subsequently
renatured
mixture of the muscle-type
(mm-ck)
and brain-type
(bbck) isoenzymes revealed an additional
band with intermediate mobility (8,18). this mb-ck heterodimer
was found also
naturally in adult heart (8, 14) and during the developmental
transition
from bb-ck to mm-ck
in striated muscle (14,19,
20). a number of investigators
tried to find a clear-cut correlation between the serum content of mb-ck
and several
heart diseases (21-25).
in contrast to these dimeric ck isoenzymes, the naturally
occurring oligomeric form(s) of mitochondrial
creatine kinase
from bovine (26-30), chicken (31-33), dog (34), human (35,
36), pig (37), rabbit (37), and rat heart (38) as well as from
pigeon breast muscle (39) has been a matter of debate for
many years. whereas some groups claimed that mi-ck
is
always a dimeric molecule (80-90 kda) like all the cytosolic
ck isoenzymes (32, 34-36), others found oligomeric
forms
with higher molecular masses (240-360 kda, refs. 26,33, and
37-39). recently, extensive studies on bovine, chicken, pig,
and rabbit heart mi-ck revealed that the higher m, form of
mi-ck is composed of eight subunits (10, 33, 37, 40-42), and
that probably both dimeric and octameric mi-ck are physiologically
important
(43). a change in the dimer to octamer
ratio might be an effective means of regulating
the energy
metabolism
of a cell (29, 39, 43-45).
the present study was undertaken
for two principal
reasons: (i) since chicken brain and chicken heart are known to

in a recent study it has been shown that mitochondrial creatine

and
heart (m&&k)
are two distinct

differing
in ten out of the thirty n-terminal

in contrast,
no heterodimers
were obtained
between
mib- and m- or bck. furthermore,
reoctamerization
of a mixture
of
mi,- and  xxxg470xxx 
homodimers
led to the formation
of
mi,mi&k
heterooctamers.
in these heterooctamers,
the mi,- and  xxxg470xxx 
homodimers
remained
the fundamental
building
blocks.
no subunit

the heterooctamer
could

of these data on the structural
organization of the mi-ck

isoenzymes (mifl-ck in brain and
in 10 out of the 30 n-terminal

amino acids (9), and since up to now only the sizes of the
 xxxg470xxx  oligomers were properly investigated,
the molecular
masses of dimeric and octameric ml-ck were determined by

three different techniques. (ii) for a variety of oligomeric
proteins, different subunit isoforms are known to yield, upon
random combination,
several distinct isoenzyme species. in
the case of lactate dehydrogenase,
for example, two different

subunit isoforms, the m- (muscle) and h- (heart) type, combine to give five different tetrameric
lactate dehydrogenase
isoenzymes: mq, msh,  xxxg1447xxx , mhs, and hq (for reviews see

refs. 46 and 47). metabolic adaptation was shown to be

tracts for their heterodimer formation experiments. using
purified human ck isoenzymes, grace et al. (35) and blum et
al. (36) were not able to reproduce the formation of a mibck heterodimer.
experimental

procedures

the disodium salts of adp and atp were obtained from boehringer mannheim (federal republic of germany), cr from sigma, pcr
from calbiochem (lucerne, switzerland), guanidine hydrochloride
from fluka (buchs, switzerland), and urea (ultra pure) from icn
biomedicals, inc. (eschwege, frg). all other chemicals were at least
of reagent grade. the blue sepharose cl-6b affinity matrix was
obtained from pharmacia (diibendorf, switzerland).
purification of chicken brain m1’-ck-all
purification steps were
performed at 4 “c. 74 g of brain tissue from 4-week-old chicken were
homogenized with a polytron mixer (kinematica, kriens, switzerland) in 520 ml of buffer a (220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm
hepes, 0.2 mm edta, 1 mm bme, 1 mm nana, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, ph 7.4). the supernatant of a first centrifugation at 650 x g for 10 min was centrifuged at 27,500 x g for 30
min. after resuspension of the pellet with a sorvall omnimixer (du
pont instruments, bad nauheim, frg) in 220 ml of buffer a, another
two centrifugations were performed at 650 x g for 10 min and at
27,500 x g for 40 min, respectively. the mitochondria were then
swollen by two consecutive incubations in 115 ml of bidistilled water
for 15 min, followed by centrifugations at 27,500 x g for 40 and 60
min, respectively. from the mitoplast pellet thus obtained, mi,-ck
was extracted for 15 min in a total volume of 335 ml of hypotonic
phosphate buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mm bme) at ph 8.75.
after ultracentrifugation
at 38,000 x g for 4 h, the supernatant
containing most of the ck activity was adjusted to the buffer composition of buffer b (50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.2 mm edta, 1 mm
mgcl,, 1 mm bme, 1 mm nanj by addition of the pure substances.
during these additions, the ph of the mixture was always kept above
ph 6.75 with 10 m naoh, and at the end it was adjusted to ph 6.80.
this material was loaded with a flow rate of 2-3 ml/min on a blue
sepharose cl-6b column (1 mg of protein/ml of column matrix)
preequilibrated with 10 column volumes of buffer b, ph 6.75 (fig. 1,
fractions l-18). the column was then washed with 2.5 volumes of
buffer b, ph 6.95 (fractions 19-41) which released, among other
proteins, all the  xxxg467xxx  from the affinity matrix. mi.-ck was specifically eluted by three volumes of buffer c (37.5 mm sodium phosphate,

accompanied
by changes in the relative proportion
of these
five isoenzymes. therefore,
we determined
in this study the
extent of heterodimer
and heterooctamer
formation
of mi,and  xxxg470xxx  with each other as well as with chicken m- and
 xxxg467xxx .
m- and  xxxg467xxx  are known to form mb-ck heterodimers.
in
addition, several investigators
have tried to generate heterodimeric molecules between cytoplasmic and mitochondrial
ck
isoenzymes from bovine (28), dog (34), and human tissues
(35, 36, 48, 49), but failed with one exception. wevers et al.
(48) reported the formation of a heterodimer
between human
heart mi-ck and brain  xxxg467xxx . however, it cannot be ruled
out that the intermediate
band apparent in their preparation
was due to very small amounts of contaminating
mb-ck,
since these authors used crude mitochondrial
phosphate
ex-

25 mm adp, 0.2 mm edta, 1 mm mgc12, 1 mm bme, 1 mm nana,
ph 6.95; fractions 42-61). an additional wash of the column with
buffer b supplemented with 1 m nacl (ph 7.05) (fractions 62-83)
did not result in a further release of ck activity, suggesting that the
ck loaded had been recovered almost completely in the two peaks
containing ck activitv. fractions 49-55 containing most of the mick activity were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration
(amicon,
grace ag, wallisellen, switzerland) to a protein concentration of 8
mg/ml (1.7 ml final volume), and dialyzed extensively against buffer
d (10 mm sodium uhosuhate, 50 mm nacl. 2 mm bme, 0.2 mm
edta, ph 6.5). about 3 mg of the dialyzed’protein/run
were then
applied on a mono s-hr 5/5 column (fplc, pharmacia) preequilibrated with 10 column volumes of buffer d. separation of the bound
proteins was achieved by a step gradient from 50 to 480 mm nacl
(fig. 2). m&-ck was eluted at a nacl concentration of 265 mm.
generation of heterodimeric
ck molecules-heterodimer
formation experiments with guanidine hydrochloride (gdnhcl) as denaturinn aeent were nerformed as follows: purified mi.-, mih-, m-, and
b-c<, as well as ^a11possible combinations of two-out of the four
isoenzymes were denatured at a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml
and at 25 “c! for 30 min in buffer e supplemented with 4 m gdnhcl
(buffer e: 50mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm nacl, 0.2 mm edta, 2
mm bme. 1 mm nans. dh 7.2). after this incubation, the samples
were immediately transferred to’s brl microdialysis system (g&o/
brl ag, basel, switzerland) and dialyzed twice for 4 h at 4 “c
against buffer e supplemented with 4 mm atp and 5 mm mgcl,.
heterodimer formation experiments with urea as denaturing agent
were performed in a similar way with the following exceptions: 6 m
urea was used instead of 4 m gdnhcl, and the samples were dialyzed
twice against buffer e supplemented with 4 mm adp, 5 mm mgcl,,
20 mm cr. and 50 mm knox. for the immunodetection of mhm-ck
(fig. 5),-denaturation and renaturation were performed as described
for the heterodimer formation experiments with 6 m urea, except that
8 m urea was used in order to generate a larger amount of this m&mck heterodimer.

molecules-for
the experiment shown in fig. 6, pure mi,- and  xxxg470xxx  as well as a mixture of
equal amounts of both isoenzymes were incubated at fixed mi-ck
concentrations for 24 h at 4 “c in buffer e supplemented with 4 mm
adp. 5 mm mecl,.
- -, 20 mm cr. and 50 mm kno, ~ (dh
.- 7.2). then, the
ratio of mi-ck octamers to dimers was determined by gel permeation
chromatography on a fplc superose 12 column (pharmacia).
for the experiment shown in fig. 7, a mixture of equal amounts of
mi.- and mih-ck was comnletelv dimerized bv incubation for 24 h at
4 ‘c in buffer e supplemented with 4 mm ad-p, 5 mm mgcl,, 20 mm
cr, and 50 mm knos (ph 7.2; at a mi-ck concentration of 0.1 mg/
ml, total volume 1.08 ml). subsequently, this mixture was concentrated with a centricon’” 10 microconcentrator
(amicon) to 40 ~1,
washed once with 1 ml of buffer e, and concentrated again to 70 ~1.
the sample thus obtained was analyzed by fplc gel permeation
chromatography (superose 12, pharmacia) and by cellulose polyacetate electrophoresis. after storage at 4 “c for 3 months, this same
sample was dimerized again by incubation in buffer e supplemented
with 4 mm adp, 5 mm mgcl*, 20 mm cr, and 50 mm kno, (ph 7.2)
and analyzed by cellulose polyacetate electrophoresis.
cellulose
po&acetate
electrophoresis-cellulose
polyacetate electrophoresis was performed at room temperature on cellogel strips
(no. ola42, biotec-fischer, reiskirchen, frg) in an electrophoresis
tank purchased from the same company, with buffer f (11.7 mm
barbiturate, 52.4 mm diethylbarbiturate,
1.4 mm bme, ph 8.6) as
running buffer. the ck isoenzymes were separated at room temperature at a constant voltage of 145 v for 40 min (fig. 4), at 100 v for
135 min (fig. 5), or at 100 v for 90 min (fig. 7). after electrophoresis,
the ck bands were visualized by the overlay gel technique as described
in ref. 31.
for the immunodetection of the ck bands, the proteins from the
cellogel strips were semi-dry-blotted in an sds-containing transfer
buffer at a constant current of 1 ma/cm’ for 105 min onto nitrocellulose membranes (50). incubation with the primary and secondary
antibody as well as the peroxidase staining with chloronaphthol as
substrate were performed as described in ref. 10. rabbit anti-chicken
mi,-, mib-, and  xxxg468xxx  sera diluted 1:50 with blocking buffer (10%
horse serum in phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm nan3, ph 7.2-7.4)
were used as primary antibodies. peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit
igg (nordic, biogenzia lemania ag, lausanne, switzerland) diluted
1:looo with blocking buffer was used as secondary antibody.

differential centrifugation, and subsequent swelling of the
mitochondria in bidistilled water. the specific ck activity
determined for these mitoplasts (0.95 iu/mg protein) corresponds well to the values found for chicken heart (0.6 iu/mg,
ref. 33, 1.5 eu/mg at 30 “c, ref. 32).
in a second step, m&-ck was extracted from the mitoplasts
by hypotonic phosphate treatment (10 mm sodium phosphate,
5 mm bme) at ph 8.75. for some reason, the indicated yield
of the extraction (48%) as well as the specific ck activity of
the mitochondrial extract of this particular preparation (5.0
iu/mg protein) were significantly lower than the values typically obtained in other mifl-ck purifications which generally
were in the range of 7083% and 10.2-14 iu/mg protein,
respectively.
as a third step, affinity chromatography on blue sepharose
cl-6b matrix was performed. the elution profile (fig. 1)
shows that ck activity was eluted in two peaks. as checked
by cellulose polyacetate electrophoresis,  xxxg467xxx  was specifically eluted in the first and m&ck in the second peak,
therefore proving that by this affinity chromatography step,
the two ck isoenzymes can effectively be separated as already
shown for chicken heart mi- and  xxxg467xxx  (31).
after the fractions from the affinity chromatography containing mi-ck activity had been pooled, concentrated, and
dialyzed against buffer d, the specific activity of mi,-ck for
all purifications performed was in the range of 24-36 iu/mg
protein. finally, this material was loaded onto a mono s
cation exchange column and eluted by a step gradient with
increasing nacl concentrations (fig. 2). again, two peaks
with ck activity were observed. gel permeation chromatography on a fplc superose 12 column (pharmacia) showed
that in the breakthrough fractions dimeric and with 265 mm
nacl octameric mi,,-ck was eluted, indicating that the two
oligomeric forms of  xxxg469xxx  behaved very differently on the
cation exchanger. m&-ck octamers eluting in the second
peak had a specific activity of 50-150 iu/mg protein. the
specific activity was generally dependent on the presence of
bme. in all our experiments, no differences between the
specific activities of climeric and octameric mixk
were
evident, in accordance to the results for mi&k (33), but in
contrast to the results published by fedosov and belousova
(44) for bovine heart mi-ck.

peptide isolation
and sequencing-purified
mi.-ck (-100 rg) was
reduced using 1 mm dithiothreitol in 6 m gdnhcl under nitrogen for
4 h in the dark. the cysteines were then alkylated using a 2-fold
excess of iodoacetic acid over dithiothreitol for 4 h. the reaction was
stopped by addition of dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 5 mm.
the protein was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 10%) and washed twice with 10% trichloroacetic acid. the
precipitate was taken up in 100 ~1 of 70%  xxxd2154xxx  in water and
digested with a hundredfold excess of cnbr over methionine under
nitrogen in the dark for 24 h.
the solution was diluted to 1 ml with water and then dried under
a stream of dry nitrogen at 55 “c. this was repeated three times. the
peptides were then taken up in 100 pl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in
water and injected onto the hplc. the first separation was done
using a gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (ph 2.0) to
100%  xxxd3026xxx , 0.065% trifluoroacetic acid on a brownlee 300 a,
c-4, 7 pm, 2.1 x 30-mm reverse phase column (paul bucher, basel,
switzerland). detection was at 206 nm and fractions were collected
by hand. the peaks were rechromatographed on a brownlee 300 a,
c-18, 7 pm, 2.1 x 30-mm reverse phase column using a gradient of
0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water to 70% acetonitrile in water, 0.09%
trifluoroacetic acid.
purified peptides and the n terminus of the pure protein were
sequenced on an applied biosystems 470a sequencer with on-line
microbore phenylthiohydantoin
detection. amino acid sequences
were aligned according to the method of needleman and wunsch
(51).
other methods-ph
optima and ck activities in general were
determined in both reaction directions by the ph-stat method as
described in ref. 52 at ph 7.00 (atp synthesis) or 8.00 (pcr synthesis) and at 25 or 42 “c, respectively, with either 20 mm hcl or 20 mm
naoh as titrant, but without bsa in the assay mixture. 1 iu
corresponds to 1 pmol of pcr transphosphorylated per min at ph 7.0
and 25 “c. when enzyme activities were measured at other temperatures, enzyme units (eu) are used instead of iu.
after sds-page performed according to ref. 53, proteins were
visualized either by coomassie brilliant blue r-250 or by silver
staining (54). the isoelectric points of mi,-and  xxxg470xxx  were determined by isoelectric focusing on ief 3-9 gels with the phastsystem’”
of pharmacia and with the ief calibration kit “broad” (pharmacia)
as reference. except otherwise stated, protein concentrations were
determined according to bradford (55) using the bio-rad reagents
and bsa as standard. scanning transmission electron microscopy of
glutardialdehyde-fixed
 xxxg469xxx  octamers with tobacco mosaic virus
as standard as well as ultracentrifugation
experiments were performed
as described in ref. 41. gel permeation chromatography was performed on a superose 12 column (fplc, pharmacia) as described in
(33) with ferritin (440 kda), catalase (232 kda), aldolase (158 kda),
chicken bb-ck (80 kda), and cu-chymotrypsinogen (24.5 kda) as
marker proteins. optical densities at 280 nm (atso.,,,) were measured
with a beckman du-7 spectrophotometer.

that for  xxxg469xxx  a specific ck activity of 5-14 iu/mg protein

was already achieved by only extracting the enzyme from the
inner mitochondrial membrane, together with the observed
deleterious effect of ammonium sulfate on m&ck activity,
led to the omission of the ammonium sulfate fractionation
step from the purification scheme for  xxxg469xxx .
the most serious problem, however, emerged from the
significantly faster dissociation of mi&k octamers into dimers as compared to  xxxg470xxx  octamers. due to this fact, the
blue sepharose column could not be washed at ph 8.0 to
remove contaminating proteins, since at this elevated ph,
octamer dissociation was induced, and m&,-ck dimers leaked
continuously from the column. since the relative proportion
of mi,-ck octamers to dimers is strongly dependent on the
protein concentration (28, 44, 45), care had also to be taken
to load only highly concentrated m&-ck samples (~1 mg of
protein/ml) onto the mono s column to favor the octameric
form, because under the buffer conditions used only the
octamer did bind to the column.
the fact that  xxxg469xxx  could not be purified following the
protocol developed for  xxxg470xxx  (different conditions necessary

m&,-ck octamer structure as compared to the  xxxg470xxx  octamer are further proof that ml- and mit,-ck are indeed two
different isoenzymes (see also below).

of mi,-ck-in
table ii, the
biophysical data for m&ck are compiled and compared with
the corresponding values for  xxxg470xxx , some of which have
been published (10, 33,41).
although mi.- and ml,-ck are two different isoenzymes,
the overall three-dimensional structure of these enzymes
seems to be very similar, for electron microscopy of both
negatively stained mi,- and  xxxg470xxx  octamers had revealed a
cube-like structure with a central, strain-filled cavity (10). to
further prove the similarity between the two isoenzymes, the
size of the different oligomeric forms of m&ck (monomer,
dimer, and octamer) was determined by a variety of different
techniques. sds-page revealed a molecular mass of 41.5
kda for the monomer, gel permeation chromatography and
analytical ultracentrifugation a molecular mass of 85 kda for
the dimer, and gel permeation chromatography, analytical
ultracentrifugation as well as scanning transmission electron
microscopy a molecular mass of 306-352 kda for the octamer.
the variance in values obtained for the size of the octamer
can be explained in part by the different standards used for
the different techniques (i.e. marker proteins for gel permeation chromatography and tobacco mosaic virus for stem)
and by the fact that the molecular mass values determined by
stem were not corrected for the protein-hound glutardialdehyde, which typically amounts to approximately 10% of the
total mass (41). however, comparison of the molecular masses
of mi,- and  xxxg470xxx  points to a very similar size of ml- and
 xxxg470xxx  monomers, dimers, and octamers, m&ck being perhaps somewhat smaller or more densely packed than  xxxg470xxx .
the above values are also in the same range as already
published values for mi-ck from chicken (10, 32, 33), dog
(34), human (36), pig (37), rabbit (37), bovine (44, 56), and
rat cardiac muscle (38), as well as from pigeon breast muscle
(39), which were in the range of 42-44 kda for the monomer,
75-87 kda for the dimer, and 240-380 kda for the high
molecular mass oligomer. the value of about 240 kda reported
for the rat heart mi-ck octamer (38) may be explained by
dissociation of the octamer during conventional gel filtration,

‘the protein concentrations of the mi- and  xxxg470xxx  samples used for this experiment were determined
according to bradford (54) and according to smith et al. (69) with bsa as standard. the protein concentration
used for the calculation of asm”,,, was obtained by averaging three values each of both protein determinations.

since fplc gel permeation chromatography (performed
within 0.5 h) of rat heart mi-ck kindly provided by dr. d.
cheneval revealed a molecular mass of 341 kda for the
octamer. thus, the high molecular mass forms of all avian
and mammalian mi-ck isoenzymes seem to have a m, > 300
kda, therefore favoring the interpretation that this form of
mi-ck is indeed an octamer. in no experiment was there any
indication for an intermediate hexameric form of chicken
mi,- and  xxxg470xxx  as suggested by fedosov and belousova for
bovine heart mi-ck (44).
isoelectric focusing revealed a higher isoelectric point for
the octamer than for the dimer for both mi,- and mit,-ck
(43). due to the marked tendency of the m&ck octamer to
dissociate into dimers during isoelectric focusing, its p1 is
indicated in table ii with a somewhat larger variability. for
both mi.- and  xxxg470xxx , the p1 values are in accordance to the
findings of dr. c. vial’s group (57, 58) which reported a
significantly higher p1 for the rabbit heart mi-ck octamer
(8.83) than for the dimer (8.24). since other studies indicated
that the interaction of mi-ck with the inner mitochondrial
membrane is at least in part of ionic nature (59-62), it has
been assumed that this higher p1 value may be responsible
for the preferential binding of the octamer to the inner
mitochondrial membrane (43, 58). nevertheless, it should be
kept in mind that, in contrast to all these results, lipskaya et
al. (63) have published a higher p1 value for the pigeon breast
muscle and bovine heart mi-ck dimer than for the octamer.
the enzymatic activities of mi.- and  xxxg470xxx  are highly
temperature-dependent, with the dependence being more pronounced for mi&k. for both mi-ck isoenzymes as well as
for both directions of the enzymatic reaction, the temperature
optima were essentially the same and correspond well to the
body temperature of the chicken (40-43 “c). above 51 “c,

both isoenzymes were rapidly inactivated probably by denaturation of the protein. the similarity between the a2sonm
values of mi,- and  xxxg470xxx  (1.01 versus 0.88/cm) was further
corroborated by the value obtained for mi,-ck, when protein
determination was performed by amino acid analysis (i.21
cm).* in contrast to the v,,,,. values in the direction of atp
synthesis, which were also rather similar for mi.- and mibck, significant differences in the ph optima of the two
isoenzymes were found, taken together with the p1 values (see
above) and with the already published k,,, values for pcr of
0.4 mm for mi,- and 1.6 mm for  xxxg470xxx  (lo), these results
point to clear functional differences between the two isoenzymes.
in table iii, the sequences of six m&ck peptides obtained
by cyanogen bromide digestion are shown and compared with
the cdna-derived sequences for chicken leg muscle mi-ck
(which is thought to be identical to chicken heart mit,-ck,
ref. 9) and human placenta mi-ck (64). whereas the very
n-terminal part of the molecule is completely different between mi,- and  xxxg470xxx  (nine amino acid changes among the
14 n-terminal amino acids), the other parts of the mi&k
sequence shown here are very similar to the corresponding
ones of  xxxg470xxx  (six amino acid changes among 93 amino acid
residues determined). this high degree of homology is not
surprising, for chicken leg muscle mi-ck (9) and human
placenta mi-ck (64) display a homology of 84%, chicken and
human  xxxg468xxx  one of 89%, and chicken and human  xxxg467xxx  one
of 88%. compared to that, homologies between either chicken
or human mi-, and m-, and  xxxg467xxx  are considerably smaller
(68-81% in the case of the chicken ck isoenzymes, 65-77%
in the case of the human isoenzymes). the fact that placenta

of samples

ent samples were then analyzed by cellulose polyacetate electrophoresis (fig. 4) and by enzyme activity measurements.
the recoveries of the enzymatic activity were in the range of
26-82%, with m&-ck displaying the lowest and  xxxg468xxx  the
highest degree of recovery.
in the case of the renatured pure homodimeric isoenzymes
(fig. 4, a-f, left and right lane of each panel), cellulose
polyacetate electrophoresis revealed one single band each
exactly at the same positions as the nondenatured isoenzymes,
indicating that no additional bands were created by the denaturation procedure itself. analysis of the mixtures of two
heterologous isoenzymes treated identically (fig. 4, a-f, middle lane) revealed in three cases an additional band that was
apparently due to the formation of heterodimeric molecules
between mi,- and  xxxg470xxx  (panel a), mi,- and  xxxg468xxx  (panel
b), and m- and  xxxg467xxx  (panel f). no additional bands, however, were observed for the other three combinations (panels
c-e) even on heavily overloaded cellulose polyacetate strips
(not shown). this was definitely not due to insufficient denaturation of the homodimers, since the formation of mband mi,mi&k
heterodimers as an internal control unambiguously proved that all four ck isoenzymes were monomerized and did reassemble again into dimers during renaturation. the ratio of heterodimers to homodimers could therefore
be used as a reliable measure for the strength of subunit
interaction in the respective heterodimers.
the m&m&-ck and mb-ck heterodimer bands in the
respective samples made up a large proportion of the total
ck activity, indicating that the subunit interaction strength
in these heterodimers is almost the same as in the original
homodimers. in contrast, mi,- and  xxxg467xxx , mib- and  xxxg467xxx ,
and mib- and  xxxg468xxx  did not form heterodimers implying that
the two different subunit isoforms failed to interact strongly
enough with each other. however, quite surprisingly, a small
amount of mi. xxxg468xxx  heterodimers was also formed as shown
in fig. 4b.
heterodimer formation experiments similar to those shown
in fig. 4 were also performed by using 6 m urea instead of 4

well as cellulosepolyacetate electrophoresiswere performed as describedunder “experimental procedures.”in each panel (a-f), the
resultsof a heterodimer formation experiment between two particular
ck isoenzymes(mi,-, mib-, m-, and  xxxg467xxx ) are shown. the electrophoretic patterns of the respectivedenatured and subsequently renatured pure isoenzymes(left and right lane of each panel) are

were obtained, except that in all cases the ratio of heterodimers to homodimers formed upon renaturation was smaller.
the recoveries of the enzymatic activity were in the range of
58-93%. since up to now no unequivocal evidence for a
heterodimer between a mitochondrial and a cytoplasmic ck
isoenzyme has been presented, cellulose polyacetate strips as
the ones shown in fig. 4 were directly semi-dry-blotted onto
nitrocellulose membranes. subsequently, ml- and  xxxg468xxx  subunits were immunodetected by polyclonal rabbit anti-mland anti- xxxg468xxx  antibodies (fig. 5). the two antibodies proved
to be very specific, for the anti-mi.-ck antibody did not
cross-react with  xxxg468xxx , and vice versa. both antibodies, however, stained the intermediate band between the ml-ck and
the  xxxg468xxx  homodimer bands, thereby strongly supporting the
conclusion that this band is due to mi. xxxg468xxx  heterodimers.
even though the relative proportion of the mlm-ck heterodimer was rather small, one might ask about its physiological significance. a hypothesis shall be given here. mi-ck,
 xxxg468xxx , and  xxxg467xxx  are all coded for by nuclear genes (9, 64,
66). in tissues containing ck activity and pcr, at least one
mitochondrial and one cytoplasmic ck isoenzyme are generally coexpressed. the cytosolic isoenzyme remains in the
cytosol, whereas mi-ck has to be transported to the mitochondria and translocated into the intermembrane space. if
heterodimer formation between the mitochondrial and the
cytoplasmic ck isoenzyme were allowed, mi-ck would be
trapped in the cytosol due to the surplus of the cytosolic ck
isoenzyme. for “economical” reasons, therefore, heterodimer
formation between the coexpressed mitochondrial and cytoplasmic ck isoenzymes must be suppressed. the formation
of a mi* xxxg468xxx  heterodimer is allowed because ml-ck (found
in chicken brain and retina) and  xxxg468xxx  (found in chicken
skeletal muscle) probably are never coexpressed in uiuo within
the same cell.
to support this hypothesis, and to get more information
about the physiological significance of the mi, xxxg470xxx  heterodimer, the tissue distribution of all ck homo- and heterodimers has to be studied in detail.

mi-ck molecules-two different experiments were performed to analyze the ability of

knob (ph 7.2). this experimental
set-up was chosen for the
following
reasons: the equilibrium
between dimeric and octameric mi-ck
was shown to be highly dependent
on the
concentration
of mi-ck (z&44,45).
in addition, this equilibrium can be shifted in the direction
of dimeric mi-ck
by
forming a transition
state-analogue
complex of the enzyme
with mgadp, cr, and no, (67). it was a definite advantage
that in the presence of the latter substances, the equilibrium
between octameric and dimeric mi-ck was already reached
after a few hours, whereas in their absence, it was reached
with mih-ck only after several months (68).
if mi,- and  xxxg470xxx  homodimers
were not able to interact
with each other to form heterooctameric
molecules, the effective concentration
of both isoenzymes
responsible
for the
ratio of mi-ck octamers to dimers would only be half the
total mi-ck concentration.
in this case, the ratio of octameric
to dimeric mi-ck would be expected to be considerably
lower
than if both mi-ck isoenzymes were to participate
in this
equilibrium
reaction. for this same case, one can calculate
the dependence of octamer proportion
uersus mi-ck concen-

tration from the values obtained with pure mi,- and  xxxg470xxx .
the corresponding
curve is also shown in fig. 6 (0). the
intermediate
position of the octamer/dimer
equilibrium
curve
obtained experimentally
for the mixture of mi,- and mit,-ck
(a) between the curves for the pure isoenzymes ( xxxg469xxx , e,
 xxxg470xxx , 0) and the curve calculated
for the case as if no
heterooctamer
formation
between mi.- and  xxxg470xxx  homodimers were possible (0) strongly indicates that (i) mi.- and
 xxxg470xxx  homodimers
indeed can interact with each other and
form heterooctameric
molecules and that (ii) in the heterooctamers, the interaction
between the homodimers
is somewhat
weaker than in the homooctamers.
in a second experiment,
a mixture of both mi-ck
isoenzymes was completely
dimerized
by incubation
with 4 mm
adp, 5 mm mgcl*, 20 mm cr, and 50 mm kn03, ph 7.2.
reoctamerization
was then achieved by removing
the substrates and by concentrating
the sample. the mi-ck mixture
thus obtained consisted of 68% octameric and 32% dimeric
mi-ck as checked by fplc gel permeation
chromatography.
cellulose polyacetate electrophoresis
of this mixture (fig. 7a,
lane 2) followed by staining for ck activity revealed prominent, broad staining between the positions of pure octameric
mi.- (lane i) and  xxxg470xxx  (lane 3), but no discrete ck bands.
the lack of discrete heterooctamer
bands is probably due to
the limited resolution of this separation method and to partial
dimerization
of  xxxg469xxx  octamers during electrophoresis,
a
phenomenon
that was always observed (see also lanes 1 and
3 of fig. 7). therefore,
it is evident from both experiments
described above (figs. 6 and 7) that homodimers
of the two
mi-ck isoenzymes can combine to give different heterooctamer species.
after storage for 3 months at 4 “c, the mi-ck heterooctamer mixture (fig. 7a, lane 2) was dimerized again by incubation with 4 mm adp, 5 mm mgc12, 20 mm cr, and 50 mm
kn03 (ph 7.2). cellulose polyacetate
electrophoresis
(fig.
7b) revealed almost no mi, xxxg470xxx 
heterodimers
indicating
that mi-ck octamers are composed of discrete mi-ck dimers,
and that in the octameric mi-ck molecule, no subunit exchange between these discrete dimers takes place. the much
more pronounced
stability of mi-ck dimers is further corroborated by the finding
that mi-ck
dimers, in contrast to
octamers, were remarkably
stable to up to 2 m urea or gdnhcl
(41). thus, it can be concluded
that, within
the mi-ck
octamers, discrete dimers and not the monomers
are the
fundamental
building blocks. despite the pronounced
dimer
stability, formation
of m&m&-ck
heterodimers
is possible at
least in uitro after complete dissociation
of the mi-ck dimers
by urea of gdnhcl
(fig. 4). future studies will focus on the
natural occurrence of mi, xxxg470xxx 
heterodimers
and heterooctamers.
