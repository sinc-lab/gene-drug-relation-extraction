6-chloro-3-alkylamino-4h-thieno[3,2-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxide derivatives were synthesized and characterized as activators of adenosine 5′-triphosphate (atp) sensitive potassium
(katp) channels in the beta-cells by measuring effects on membrane potential and insulin release
in vitro. the effects on vascular tissue in vitro were measured on rat aorta and small mesenteric
vessels. selected compounds were characterized as competitive inhibitors of [3h] xxxd2215xxx 
binding to membranes of hek293 cells expressing human  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  and as potent inhibitors
of insulin release in isolated rat islets. 6-chloro-3-(1-methylcyclobutyl)amino-4h-thieno[3,2e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxide (54) was found to bind and activate the  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  katp
channels in the low nanomolar range and to be at least 1000 times more potent than the
reference compound  xxxd1868xxx  with respect to inhibition of insulin release from rat islets. several
compounds, e.g., 3-propylamino- (30), 3-isopropylamino- (34), 3-(s)-sec-butylamino- (37), and
3-(1-methylcyclopropyl)amino-4h-thieno[3,2-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxide (53), which were
found to be potent and beta-cell selective activators of katp channels in vitro, were found to inhibit
insulin secretion in rats with minimal effects on blood pressure and to exhibit good oral
pharmacokinetic properties.
introduction
diabetes is becoming a global health problem with
an increasing number of people affected by either type
1 or type 2 diabetes. whereas type 1 diabetes is
characterized by rapid, autoimmune depletion of the
insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells, type 2 diabetes is
a slowly progressing disease affecting glucose and lipid
homeostasis, frequently associated with obesity and
elevated risk for cardiovascular diseases. a pivotal
component of type 2 diabetes is dysfunctional insulin
release including reduced first phase insulin release,
hyperinsulinaemia, and impaired insulin pulsatility.
type 2 diabetes ultimately leads to beta-cell degeneration
resulting in insufficient insulin release and the need for
administration of exogenous insulin.
in pancreatic beta-cells, adenosine 5′-triphosphate (atp)
sensitive potassium channels (katp channels) couple
changes in blood glucose concentrations to insulin
secretion.1 katp channels also have important functions
in various other tissues, and their structure and function have been described in detail.2-4
the  xxxg1253xxx  exists as an octameric complex of
the sulfonylurea receptor (sur) and the pore-forming
inwardly rectifying  xxxg1232xxx  (kir) in a 4 + 4
stoichiometry. intracellular nucleotides and different
drugs regulate its activity. whereas atp and certain
sulfonylurea and  xxxd306xxx  insulin secretagogues are
inhibitors (blockers), mgadp (adenosine 5′-diphosphate)
and  xxxg1232xxx  openers stimulate potassium
currents.

the genes for two closely related surs,  xxxg19xxx  and
 xxxg20xxx  have been cloned. two different splice variants
of  xxxg20xxx , sur2a, and sur2b have been reported.
 xxxg19xxx  combines with  xxxg1250xxx  to form the katp channels
of pancreatic beta-cells, whereas the cardiac and the
skeletal muscle type consist of sur2a and  xxxg1250xxx  and
the smooth muscle type consists of sur2b and kir6.1
or  xxxg1250xxx .
 xxxg1232xxx  openers, which activate the katp
channels of vascular smooth muscle, are well-described.5
these include cyanoguanidines such as pinacidil (1),
chromanes such as cromakalim (2), and 1,2,4-thiadiazines such as  xxxd1868xxx  (3) (chart 1).6-9 whereas pinacidil and cromakalim have little or no effect on katp
channels of beta-cells,10-12  xxxd1868xxx  nonselectively activates both katp channels of beta-cells ( xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx ) and

those of smooth muscle (sur2b/ xxxg1250xxx ) and has weak
stimulatory effects on katp channels of the heart
(sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx ).13
the ability of  xxxd1868xxx  to activate the katp channels
of pancreatic beta-cells results in inhibition of glucosestimulated insulin release.14,15 human studies have
shown that  xxxd1868xxx  reduces glucose-stimulated insulin
release in healthy individuals16 and ameliorates the
abnormal hyperinsulinaemia in patients suffering from
insulinoma17 and nesidioblastosis (phhi, persistent
hyperinsulinaemia and hypoglycemia of infancy).18 several preclinical and clinical studies have indicated that
 xxxd1868xxx  can be used to reduce the hyperinsulinaemia
commonly observed in obese, prediabetic individuals to
reduce weight and to prevent the development of type
2 diabetes in animal models.19,20 recently, it has been
suggested that administration of  xxxd1868xxx  in combination with intensive insulin treatment, to induce beta-cell
rest, will prevent or delay the progression of type 1
diabetes in newly diagnosed patients.21 the use of
 xxxd1868xxx  in this study was hampered by side effects
such as severe oedema and headaches. additional side
effects associated with  xxxd1868xxx  include excessive hair
growth,22 which probably is related to the vasodilatory
effect of the compound.23
structural modifications of the  xxxd1868xxx  molecule
have been described previously. these include variations of the size of the 3-alkyl substituent, in the
substitution of position 724,25 and in the introduction of
3-alkylamino side chains to obtain hypotensive and
antiinflammatory compounds.26,27 by combining components from the structures of pinacidil and  xxxd1868xxx ,
pirotte et al.28,29 have prepared a series of  xxxd3047xxx [4,3e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides, among which bpdz 44
(4) (chart 1) was reported to be a more potent and
selective opener of katp channels of pancreatic beta-cells
than  xxxd1868xxx . these structures have subsequently
been developed to include other potent benzo-1,2,4thiadiazine 1,1 dioxide derivatives.30
in analogy, pinacidil-like cyanoguanidine derivatives
have recently been characterized as potent activators
of beta-cell katp channels with little effects on vascular
smooth muscle.31
on the basis of the above findings, we have synthesized a series of 3-alkylamino-4h-thieno[3,2-e]-1,2,4thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides in which we have varied the
3-alkylamino side chain to evaluate the structureactivity relationship based on activity of pancreatic
beta-cells and vascular smooth muscle in vitro and in vivo.
it is expected that such compounds could be valuable
tools for exploring the potential of reducing abnormal
hypersecretion of insulin as a treatment of metabolic
diseases. one compound of the series, described here,
nnc 55-0118 (34), has previously been found to protect
beta-cells of rat islets when subjected to cytotoxic concentration of  xxxd3249xxx  in vitro,32 to prevent beta-cell
degeneration in the bb rat model of type 1 diabetes33
and to prevent development of type 2 diabetes in the
oletf rat model of type 2 diabetes.34
chemistry
the different synthetic routes used to prepare the
3-alkylamino-6-chloro-4h-thieno[3,2-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides described in this paper are illustrated

in schemes 1-3. the strategy for the synthesis of key
intermediate 6-chloro-2,3-dihydro-3-oxo-4h-thieno[3,2e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxide (9) (scheme 1) was based
on a previously reported synthetic approach to the
imidazo analogue 4,5-dihydroimidazo[4,5-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazin-3(2h)-one 1,1-dioxide.35 the starting material
2-(tert-butylamino)sulfonyl-5-chlorothiophene-3-carboxylic acid (5) was prepared in two steps from 2-chlorothiophene as described by unterhalt and moghaddam.36 the carboxylic acid 5 was converted to the
corresponding ethyl ester 6 with simultaneous cleavage
of the tert-butyl group by heating in  xxxd102xxx 
saturated with hydrogen chloride. treatment of 6 with
excess hydrazine hydrate at room temperature gave the
 xxxd2396xxx  7, which was converted to the carbonyl azide
8 in almost quantitative yield by reaction with nitrous
acid. because of the potential explosion hazard of acyl
azides, crude 8 was cautiously dried37 without further
purification and then subjected to a curtius rearrangement by heating in refluxing dry toluene. the intermediate isocyanate spontaneously cyclized to the desired

1,1-dioxide derivatives (route d)a

at elevated temperatures and had longer reaction times
without improving the yields due to side reactions.
to increase the nucleophilic substitution rate, we
changed the leaving group from chloro to fluoro as
outlined in scheme 1 (route c), where the labile 3-chloro
substituent of 10 was displaced in a reaction with
cesium fluoride or activated potassium fluoride40 to give
the more reactive fluoro derivative 11. compound 11
was either purified prior to amination (53-56) or
aminated in situ (57) but in low yield despite the better
leaving group. however, amination of 11 with methylcyclopropylamine actually doubled the yield of 53 to 54%
as compared to that obtained with 10 as the starting
material.
an alternative synthesis (route d) of 3-alkylamino6-chloro-4h-thieno[3,2-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides
is shown in scheme 2. the known n-(tert-butyl)-5chloro-2-thiophenesulfonamide (12)36 was converted
to 3-amino-n-(tert-butyl)-5-chloro-2-thiophenesulfonamide (13) by ortho metalation with n-butyllithium
followed by quenching with p-toluenesulfonyl azide and
finally reduction with sodium borohydride in the presence of hexadecyltributylphosphonium bromide.41-43
cleavage of the tert-butyl group in sulfonamide 13 by
heating in fuming hydrochloric acid afforded the desired
key intermediate 14. compound 14 was reacted with
the appropriate alkyl isothiocyanate at 0-25 °c to give
the sulfonyl isothiourea derivative 15, which was readily
cyclized to the corresponding thieno[3,2-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxide by treatment with phosgene in toluene
at 0 °c in the presence of triethylamine.
as shown in scheme 3, it was possible to avoid direct
handling of the potential hazardous azides used in the
preparation of the required intermediates of routes a
and d. the acid 5 was converted to the ethyl ester 16,
from which the  xxxd2396xxx  17 was obtained by reaction
with hydrazine hydrate in nmp. compound 17 was
reacted with isoamyl nitrite in an acid-catalyzed curtius
reaction in refluxing methanol followed by hydrochloric
acid cleavage of the tert-butyl group to afford the methyl
carbamate 18a without isolation of the in situ-formed
carbonyl azide. alternatively,  xxxd774xxx  could be
made from 8 as exemplified by preparation of the ethyl
carbamate 18b. the key intermediate 18 of route e was
then reacted with alkyl isothiocyanates in refluxing

 xxxd543xxx . our first attempt to obtain the target
compounds by direct amination of  xxxd543xxx  (route
a) under conditions previously described for 2h-1,2,4benzothiadiazin-3(4h)-one 1,1-dioxides38 only resulted
in low yields (21 and 11%, respectively) of the desired
products 29 and 34. in route b (scheme 1), compound
9 was first chlorinated with phosphorus oxychloride in
the presence of pyridine or preferable with activated
phosphorus oxychloride39 in the presence of pyridine
hydrochloride and ortho-phosphoric acid, to afford 3,6dichloro-4h-thieno[3,2-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxide
(10). nucleophilic aromatic substitution of 10 with the
appropriate amines gave the desired products in varying
yields (9-94%) by heating in a sealed flask. the
reactions were performed either neat in a large excess
of the amine, but preferentially with a few equivalents
as an alcoholic solution, or with 1-2 equiv in  xxxd2400xxx 
in the presence of potassium carbonate. the best yields
were obtained with aqueous ammonia (27, 94%) or with
simple unbranched amines as, for example, methyl (28,
80%), while bulky amines generally resulted in low
yields (e.g., 53, 9%) due to incomplete conversion of 10
at the applied reaction conditions. the displacement
reactions with bulky amine nucleophiles were slow even

leading to the thieno[3,2-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine carbamates
23-26 via the sulfonyl isothiourea derivatives 19-22,
respectively. careful alkaline hydrolysis at ph 9-10
finally afforded the desired products 34, 62, 64, and 65
in modest overall yields.
the physicochemical properties of selected compounds
have been examined (table 1). the 3-alkylamino-6chloro 4h-thieno[3,2-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides
were all weak acids with pka values around 8.3. this
suggests that the compounds at physiological ph primarily will be in a neutral form. the water/octanol
distribution coefficients logdph 7.4 were measured and
found to correlate to the calculated mlogp value. the
logdph 7.4 values were dependent on the hydrophobicity
of the 3-alkylamino-side chain ranging from 1.63 (34)
to 3.14 (47) all lying within an acceptable range for
potential drugs.44
results and discussion
in vitro biology. on the basis of our aim to identify
potent and beta-cell selective  xxxg1232xxx  openers,
we decided to initially screen our compounds in assays,
which predict activation of katp channels of beta-cells and
vascular smooth muscle (tables 2-4).
glucose-induced pancreatic beta-cell insulin release is
mainly a consequence of closure of atp-regulated
potassium channels mediated by changes in the atp/
adp ratio. the closure leads to beta-cell plasma membrane
depolarization, influx of ca2+ through voltage sensitive
calcium channels, increase in cytoplasmic ca2+, and
activation of exocytosis of insulin from their pool of
secretory granules.
qualitative changes in membrane potential caused
primarily by changes in potassium fluxes were assessed
in the glucose responsive insulin-producing murine cell
line betatc3, by measuring dibac4(3) fluorescence. the
probe is cell permeable and distributes between the cells

nielsen et al.

and the extracellular medium depending on the membrane potential of the cells. inside the cells, dibac
associates with proteins and thereby enhances its
fluorescence dramatically. after the cell is depolarized,
dibac accumulates inside the cells, increasing their
fluorescence. by repolarization, dibac escapes from the
cells and their fluorescence decreases.
the ability of the compounds to inhibit the release of
insulin from the mouse beta-cell line, betatc6 incubated in
the presence of 22 mm glucose and 0.1 mm  xxxd2388xxx  to
increase the insulin release, was determined. the
vasorelaxing effects of the compounds were initially
determined by their ability to relax phenylephrinecontracted rat aorta rings as previously described.45
in table 2, the results from testing a series of
6-chloro-4h-thieno[3,2-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides
substituted in position 3 with linear alkylamino groups
are compared to the 3-amino derivative 27 and  xxxd1868xxx . the data support that  xxxd1868xxx  is a nonselective
 xxxg1232xxx  opener, which hyperpolarizes membranes of betatc3 cells, inhibits insulin release of betatc6
cells, and relaxes phenylephrine-contracted aortic rings
with approximately equal potency. this corresponds to
previous studies, which have shown that  xxxd1868xxx 
inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin release from rat
islets (ic50 ) 24.7 ( 3.4 µm) and relaxes kcl-induced
contraction of rat aortic rings (ic50 ) 22.0 ( 2.6 µm).46,47
in comparison, we found that pinacidil is a potent
vasodilator on rat aortic rings (ec50 ) 0.8 ( 0.2 µm,
data not shown) without exerting any effects on beta-cell
membrane potential or glucose-stimulated insulin release at concentrations up to 100 µm.
the 6-chloro-3-alkylamino-4h-1,2,4-thieno[3,2-e]thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides with primary alkylamino groups in
position 3 as presented in table 2 were in general able
to activate katp channels of beta-cells as determined by
the ability of the compounds to hyperpolarize membranes of betatc3 cells and to inhibit glucose-stimulated
insulin release of betatc6 cells. the size of the 3-substituent has importance for the inhibition of insulin release
from beta-cells. the n-butyl (31) (ic50 ) 1.39 ( 0.63 µm),
the ethyl (29, ic50 ) 1.9 ( 0.52 µm), the propyl (30,
ic50 ) 2.4 ( 0.44 µm), and the octyl (33, ic50 ) 1.5 (
0.5 µm) derivatives are approximately equipotent but
considerably more potent than the unsubstituted aminoderivative (27, ic50 ) 21.1 ( 17.4 µm), the methyl

(28, ic50 ) 21.18 ( 9.61 µm), and the hexyl (32, ic50 )
7.1 ( 1.6 µm) derivatives.
in addition, the compounds have been tested for their
ability to potentiate the efflux of 86rb+ from preloaded
rin5f rat insulinoma cells. as expected for compounds
that activate katp channels of beta-cells, there is an overall
good correlation between the ability of the compounds
to increase the ion currents of rin5f cells, to hyperpolarize betatc3 cells, and to inhibit insulin release from
betatc6 cells.
in comparison, these compounds were in general
considerably less potent with respect to relaxation of
rat aorta rings. potency again seems to be dependent
on the size of the alkyl group with the hexyl derivative
32 being the most potent (ec50 ) 0.15 ( 0.15 µm) as
compared to the relatively inactive ethyl (29, ec50 )
135.5 ( 36.4 µm), octyl (33, ec50 ) 176.0 ( 48 µm),
and 3-amino (27, ec50 ) 262.0 ( 38.0 µm) derivatives.
compound 32 is more potent than  xxxd1868xxx  (ec50 )
12.8 ( 2.5 µm) and as potent as pinacidil (ec50 ) 0.8 (
0.2 µm).
in table 3, a series of 6-chloro-4h-thieno[3,2-e]-1,2,4thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides substituted in position 3 with
branched alkylamino groups are presented. as found for
compounds having linear alkylamino substituents, size
seems to be important for beta-cell activity. r-methyl
substitution (for example, 34 as compared to 29 or 35
and 39 as compared to 30) increases potency. in
contrast, beta-ethyl substitution (for example, 46 as compared to 31) reduces potency. in this series of potassium
channel openers, chirality of the side chain bears little
importance for beta-cell activity. this is in agreement with
data generated on a pair of  xxxd3047xxx -1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1dioxides.48
the lipophilic compounds 40, 46, and 47 are in
general low efficacious inhibitors of glucose-stimulated
insulin release from betatc6 cells and stimulate membrane hyperpolarization of betatc3 cells with low and
variable potency. nonspecific interactions due to the
high lipophilicity or lack of aqueous solubility could
contribute to these inconsistencies. alternatively, these

compounds could inhibit the insulin secretory process
by interaction with other targets than the katp channels.
compounds 34-58 exhibit major differences with
respect to vasodilatory activity. among the compounds,
there are some vasorelaxants such as, for example, 41
(ec50 ) 2.0 ( 0.9 µm), but also compounds with little
or no effects on rat aorta like 34 (ec50 ) 266.0 ( 59.81
µm), 38 (ec50 ) 169.0 ( 39.9 µm), and 44 (ec50 >300
µm). overall, there is a dependency on chain length for
activity on rat aorta rings. the most potent vasodilators
are those having a six carbon side chain as in 32 (ec50
) 0.15 ( 0.15 µm) and 41 (ec50 ) 2.0 ( 0.88 µm) with
only small effect of a single methyl substituent (for
example, 32 as compared to 41). reducing the length
of the 3-alkylamino side chain to a 2-c or a 3-c entity
considerably reduces potency, giving rise to compounds
with considerable beta-cell selectivity. this is in agreement
with a series of n-alkyl-n′- xxxd3047xxx  cyanoguanidine (pinacidil) derivatives49 and within a series of 3-alkylamino-4h- xxxd3047xxx [4,3-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides28
among which compounds with n-methyl and n-propyl
groups are weak vasodilators.
by contrast to the beta-cell effects, the effects on vascular
tissue (rat aorta) seem to be dependent on chirality. the
(s) forms of the compounds (e.g., 37 as compared to 36
or 44 as compared to 45) are equal or less potent than
the corresponding (r) isomers. this is in accordance
with previous reports on  xxxd3047xxx -1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1dioxide derivatives48 and on pinacidil derivatives acting
on vascular tissue.48,50
6-chloro-4h-thieno[3,2-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides substituted in position 3 with cycloalkylamino
groups are presented in table 4. the size of the
carbocycle is important for potency with respect to
hyperpolarization of beta-cell membranes and inhibiton of
insulin release with the cyclobutyl (50) and the cyclopentyl (51) being more potent than the cyclopropyl (49)
and the cyclohexyl (52) derivatives. increasing the
branching at the r-atom as in compounds 53-55 and
57 leads to considerably increased potency. among these

compounds, 54 with the methylcyclobutyl amino side
chain is more potent (ic50 ) 0.02 ( 0.004 µm) than the
methylcyclopropyl 53 (ic50 ) 0.15 ( 0.03 µm), the
methylcyclopentyl 55 (ic50 ) 0.07 ( 0.03 µm), or the
methylcyclohexyl derivative 56 (ic50 ) 5.33 ( 3.84 µm)
with respect to inhibition of insulin release. in comparison, the ethylcyclobutyl derivative 57 (ic50 ) 0.02 (
0.01 µm) is more potent than the cyclobutylamino
compound 50 (ic50 ) 0.49 ( 0.21 µm) and equipotent
with 54. the increased beta-cell activity of the branched
cycloalkylamine derivatives is in accordance with the
high potency of the tert-butyl and tert-amyl derivatives
38 and 39 as compared to, for example, the isopropyl
derivative 34. in this series, there is an overall good
correlation between the effects on betatc3 cells and the
effects on betatc6 cells. with respect to smooth muscle
effects, the size of the cycloalkyl groups increases
potency exemplified by 56 (methylcyclohexyl) (ec50 )
1.4 ( 0.8 µm), which is more potent than 55 (methylcyclopentyl) (ec50 ) 6.2 ( 0.7 µm) and 54 (methylcyclobutyl) (ec50 ) 6.5 ( 1.7 µm) and considerably more
potent than 53 (methylcyclopropyl) (ec50 ) 119.2 ( 12.1
µm). the ethylcyclopropyl derivative 57 (ec50 ) 3.3 (
2.0 µm) is slightly less potent than 56 and approximately equipotent with 54.

the present results and previous reports indicate that
the size and the shape of the alkylamino side chains of
 xxxg1253xxx  openers of the cyanoguanidine and the
thiadiazine 1,1-dioxide series are very important for the
vascular activity. these lipophilic groups could occupy
a pocket on the sur2b subunit necessary for inducing
ion channel activation.
on the basis of potency and beta-cell selectivity, compounds 30, 34, 36-39, 50, 51, 53, and 54 were selected
for extensive evaluation with respect to effects on
recombined human  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  katp channels, freshly
isolated rat islets and vascular tissue in vitro (table 5),
and on blood pressure and insulin release in vivo (table
6).
to measure the direct interaction of the compounds
with recombined katp channels of the beta-cells, we
examined the displacement of radiolabeled  xxxd2215xxx  from membranes of hek293 cells expressing
human  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  potassium channels.  xxxd2215xxx 
potently binds to the  xxxg19xxx  part of the beta-cell katp
channels,51 and it has previously been shown52,53 that
competition by  xxxd1868xxx  of [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding
to  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  is highly dependent on atp and mg2+.
this was found to be the case also for compounds 30,
34, 36-39, 50, 53, and 54 (figure 1, table 5), whereas

figure 1. [3h] xxxd2215xxx  (1 nm) binding to membrane preparations from hek293 cells stably expressing human  xxxg19xxx /

compound 34, (b) compound 54, (c)  xxxd1868xxx , and (d)  xxxd2215xxx . in the presence of mgatp, [3h] xxxd2215xxx  is displaced
in a biphasic manner by  xxxg1253xxx  openers 34 and 54 from a high (h) and low (l) affinity state. values are mean ( sem of
three or more independent experiments.

competition by  xxxd2215xxx  is independent of atp and
mg2+ (pic50 ) 8.73 ( 0.06 µm (+atp); pic50 ) 8.66 (
0.05 µm (-atp)) (figure 1). the competition curves
indicate that these compounds compete with  xxxd2215xxx  in a biphasic manner, giving rise to two inhibition
constants: a high affinity component, which largely
correlates with the potency of the compounds in the
beta-cell membrane potential and the insulin release
assays, and a low affinity component, which correlates
with the inhibition by the present compounds in the
absence of atp and mg2+. in contrast,  xxxd1868xxx  exhibits
a monophasic competition curve (figure 1) suggesting
that its mode of interaction with the  xxxg1253xxx  is
different from the new 6-chloro-4h-thieno[3,2-e]-1,2,4thiadiazine 1,1-dioxide derivatives. selected compounds
(i.e., 30 and 36) were found also to inhibit binding of
[3h] xxxd2215xxx  in an atp-dependent manner to
membranes of hek293 cells expressing  xxxg19xxx  but not
 xxxg1250xxx  (data not shown). this suggests that these
compounds bind to the sur part of the  xxxg1253xxx 
complex to induce channel activation.
when measured by patch clamp in the whole cell
configuration, the present compounds (e.g., 30, 34, and
53) potently increase the ion current of human  xxxg19xxx /
 xxxg1250xxx , stably expressed in a hek293 cell line and
tranciently expressed in xenopus oocytes, but do not
activate ion currents of sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx  or sur2b/ xxxg1250xxx 
channels (data not shown).54
when freshly isolated rat pancreatic islets are subjected to a high glucose concentration, insulin secretion
is stimulated. compounds 30, 34, 36-39, 50, 51, 53,
54, and  xxxd1868xxx  dose dependently inhibit the insulin
secretion with an order of potency similar to that found
in the beta-cell screening assay discussed above (table 5).
in general, the inhibitory effect on insulin release from

rat islets occurs at concentrations 2-3 times lower than
those inhibiting insulin release from the murine betatc6
cell line. the effect of  xxxd1868xxx  on rat islets (ic50 )
20.28 ( 11.7 µm) is similar to that reported previously
(ic50 ) 24.8 ( 3.4 µm).47 the high potency of compound
54 in this assay (ic50 ) 0.01 µm) corresponds to its
potency on betatc6 cells (ic50 ) 0.002 µm) and its ability
to displace [3h] xxxd2215xxx  from human  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx 
channels (ic50 ) 0.003 µm).
all of the selected compounds of this series induced
concentration-dependent maximal vasodilatation of small
mesenteric arteries that were precontracted with phenylephrine (table 5). the relative high potency with
respect to dilatation of mesenteric arteries of all of the
tested compounds is surprising in view of the observed
effects in isolated rat aorta. recent studies, however,
have suggested that the katp channels of some vascular
tissues consist of sur2b and kir6.1 instead of  xxxg1250xxx .55,56
this potentially could lead to the discrepancy between
the effects on aorta and mesenteric arteries. to further
examine the effects of these compounds on smooth
muscle, 30, 36, and 37 were added to rat bladder rings
that were precontracted with the muscarinic agonist
 xxxd325xxx . the compounds were only very weak
dilators of bladder tissue (30, ic50 ) 146.3 ( 46.9 µm;
36, ic50 ) 204.1 ( 70.2 µm; and 37, ic50 > 300 µm;
data not shown). overall, the 6-chloro-4h-thieno[3,2e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides presented in table 5
exhibit a high degree of beta-cell selectivity as measured
by their ability to inhibit insulin release from rat islets
as compared to their vasorelaxant potency. in contrast,
 xxxd1868xxx  affects rat islets and mesenteric vessels with
equal potency.
the in vitro results strongly indicate that the present
 xxxg1232xxx  openers, e.g., 30, 34, 36, 37, 53, and

54 through binding to the  xxxg19xxx  receptor, are potent
activators of katp channels of pancreatic beta-cells with
minimal effects on vascular katp channels. on the basis
of studies on recombined atp-activated potassium
channels (sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx , data not shown), it is unlikely
that these compounds will exert  xxxg1232xxx 
opening effects on cardiac tissues. when subjected to a
panlab in vitro pharma screen, 34 and 53 (10 µm) did
not show any significant effects on a series of receptors
and ion channels. in contrast to  xxxd1868xxx ,57 34 does not
potentiate the effect of glutamate on ampa receptors
(data not shown).
among the tested compounds, 54 stands out as being
the most potent activator of beta-cell katp channels ever
described. with respect to all parameters tested in vitro,
this compound is at least 1000 times more potent than
 xxxd1868xxx . this is the first example of a compound that
is able to activate the  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  katp channels in the
low nanomolar range. only  xxxg1253xxx  blockers of
 xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  channels and activators of sur2a/ xxxg1250xxx 
and sur2b/ xxxg1250xxx  channels have previously been described to act with similar potency.58
in vivo biology.  xxxd1868xxx  has been shown to
inhibit insulin release in several species including
humans21,59,60 with a long lasting effect that can largely
be attributed to the high bioavailability and long halflife.61  xxxd1868xxx  induces a significant hypotensive response when given either intravenously (iv) or per os
(po).59 using anaesthetized, postprandial adult sprague-dawley rats as a screening model, we examined
the effects of selected 6-chloro-3-alkylamino-4h-thieno[3,2-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxide derivatives (30, 34,
36-39, 50, 51, 53, 54, and  xxxd1868xxx ) for effects on
insulin release and blood pressure upon iv administration of a fixed dose of 3 mg/kg for all compounds except
54, for which 0.3 mg/kg was used (table 6). all of the
selected 6-chloro-3-alkylamino-4h-thieno[3,2-e]-1,2,4thiadiazine 1,1-dioxide derivatives were equally efficacious (>80%) in decreasing plasma insulin levels although the effects of 30 and 51 were of shorter duration
(measured as percent decrease in plasma insulin at 30
min). in comparison, an identical dose of  xxxd1868xxx  (3
mg/kg iv) only gave a partial (53%) but sustained
reduction of the concentration of insulin in plasma.
in the present study,  xxxd1868xxx  (3 mg/kg iv) was able
to reduce mean arterial blood pressure when determined

both as percent maximal change from baseline and as
the area under the curve measured during the first 5
min after administration. compounds 30, 37, 50, and
53 had minimal effects on blood pressure while 34 and
36 decreased blood pressure less potently than  xxxd1868xxx . compounds 38, 39, 51, and 54 markedly affected
blood pressure. the potent hypotensive effect of 54 at
0.3 mg/kg was retained at 0.1 mg/kg iv (data not shown)
indicating that the compound in vivo is a considerably
more potent hypotensive drug than expected from the
in vitro data. in analogy, the hypotensive effects of 38
and 39 and the hypertensive effect of 51 were not
predicted from the screening assays and highlight that
both in vitro and in vivo tests are needed to verify the
selectivity of the present compounds.
pharmacokinetic studies in sprague-dawley rats
using cassette dosing (table 6) have shown that compounds 30, 34, 36, 37, 39, 50, and 53 all have good oral
bioavailability (fpo, 47-103%) with a plasma t1/2 after
oral administration ranging from 58 (37) to 250 min
(53). in comparison,  xxxd1868xxx  was found to have an oral
bioavailability of 154% with a plasma t1/2 of 79 min after
po administration. this is consistent with a reported
plasma half-life of  xxxd1868xxx  of 1-2 h in rats.62 the high
oral bioavailability (fpo) above 100% most likely indicates
hepatic recirculation. despite the good oral bioavailability and the ability to potently inhibit insulin release
upon iv administration, 50 was not able to reduce
plasma insulin levels in obese zucker rats after per os
administration (data not shown).
to determine the pharmacodynamic properties of the
compounds, 34 was given per os to rats (figure 2).
compound 34 suppressed the mean plasma insulin
levels both before (2.8 ( 2.8 vs 43.0 ( 3.5 pmol/l in
vehicle-treated rats, p < 0.01) and after glucose challenge (66.1 ( 37.1 vs 268 ( 39.2 pmol/l in vehicletreated rats, p < 0.05) when dosed 3 h before the latter
(figure 2a). although the insulin secretion at 3 h after
administration of 34 was suppressed by the potassium
channel opener, the beta-cells were able to respond to the
glucose challenge. when dosed 6 h before glucose, no
suppression of resting plasma insulin was seen but
glucose-stimulated insulin was still reduced to 100.3 (
23.5 pmol/l. no effect on resting or glucose-stimulated
insulin was seen in rats dosed 12 h or more before
challenge.

figure 2b shows mean blood glucose values in the
rats before and after glucose challenge. a slight but
statistically insignificant blood glucose increase was
seen before challenge at 3 and 6 h. in combination,
figure 2a,b suggests that 34 (30 mg/kg), after per oral
administration to normal rats, reduces both resting and
glucose-stimulated plasma insulin for up to 6 h without
inducing resting hyperglycemia.
to measure effects on cardiovascular parameters in
conscious animals, 54 (30 mg/kg po), 30, 36, 37, and 53
(100 mg/kg po), 34 (100 and 300 mg/kg po), and
 xxxd1868xxx  (100 and 300 mg/kg po) were given to female
sprague-dawley rats. blood pressure, heart rate, and

 xxxd1868xxx  induced a minor but significant and longlasting increase in heart rate at 100 mg/kg and a
pronounced effect on heart rate and mean arterial blood

by using structural elements from the cyanoguanidine, pinacidil, and the thiadiazine 1,1-dioxide,  xxxd1868xxx , a series of potent activators of atp-regulated
potassium channels have been synthesized. selected
3-alkylamino-4h-thieno[3,2-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides of the described series bind to the  xxxg19xxx  component of the  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx   xxxg1253xxx  and increase
channel activity to inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin
release. the activation of the  xxxg1253xxx  seems to be
species-independent suggested by the fact that the
compounds bind to and activate recombined human
katp channels and inhibit insulin release from rat islets
and from mouse beta-cell lines with approximately the
same order of potency. although previous reports have
described compounds that are able to suppress insulin
release through activation of atp-regulated potassium
channels,28,29-31 the present compounds, e.g., 30, 34, 36,
37, 50, and 53, seem superior by showing good pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. compounds such as 34 (nnc 55-0118) and 53 (nn414)
represent a new class of  xxxg1232xxx  openers
highly potent and selective for the  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  katp
channels both in vitro and in vivo. in addition, 34 is
able to reduce plasma insulin levels after per oral
administration to normal rats with minimal effect on
cardiovascular parameters and therefore could be expected to possess less side effects than  xxxd1868xxx .
compound 34 has been found to protect beta-cells in vitro32
and in vivo32,33 and to prevent the development of type
2 diabetes in oletf rats.34 the present data strongly
suggest that these effects could be mediated through
activation of  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  potassium channels. of particular interest is also compound 54, which is able to
activate the  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  katp channels in the nanomolar range. additional studies are needed for full
exploration of the pharmacology and therapeutic potentials of these molecules.

logp-pka measurements. potentiometric titration experiments were conducted on a glpka instrument from sirius
analytical instruments ltd. the determination of the ionization constant of the compound was performed in the following
way: approximately 3 mg of the compound was weighed into
a small glass vial and placed in a temperature-controlled
sample holder. a 10 ml amount of cosolvent (80% meoh) was
added, and the ph was adjusted to approximately 2. three
titrations were performed in the range of ph 2 to 10.5 on the
same sample, adding 3.00 ml of 0.15 m kcl before the second
titration and 3.00 ml of 0.15 m kcl before the third. for each
titration, a pska value was measured by refining of the data.
the pka value at 0% cosolvent was determined by using a
yasuda-shedlovsky extrapolation procedure on the pska
values determined for the three measured difference curves.
the determination of the octanol/water distribution coefficient, logp, of the compound was performed in the following
way: approximately 3 mg of the compound was weighed into
a small glass vial and placed in the temperature-controlled
sample holder. a 10.0 ml amount of 0.15 m kcl and 0.1 ml
of octanol were added. the ph was adjusted to 10.5 and
titrated to ph 2.0. three titrations were performed on the same
sample, adding 1.00 ml of octanol before the second titration
and 10.00 ml before the third. prior to data refinement, the
measured value for the aqueous pka had to be entered into
the glpka software. for each titration, the shift in the pka
value was measured. the three refined data sets were combined in a multiset, and the octanol/water distribution coefficient was extracted according to the possible partitioning
equations. the moriguchi logp (mlogp) was calculated using
commercial available software.44
effects on membrane potential in betatc3 cells. measurement of dibac4(3) fluorescence was made using the
procedure described by lebrun et al.30 for each compound and
concentration (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 µmol/l), a total of four
individual wells was used to construct the data sets underlying
the values in tables 2-4. briefly, data were normalized to the
initial value for each well and expressed as fractional fluorescence change during the 45 min incubation period using excel
(microsoft, u.s.a.). a four parameter nonlinear curve fit was
then made to extract ec50 values and sem using maccurvefit
1.3 (kevin raner software, australia).
inhibition of insulin release in vitro. (a) inhibition
of glucose-induced insulin release in betatc6 cells. betatc6
cells69 were cultured at 5 × 104 cells/microtiter well in dmem
+ 10% fetal calf serum (fcs), 11 mm glucose, 1% glutamax,
and 20 mm hepes for 3 days (95% humidity, 37 °c, 5% co2).

cells were washed twice with nn buffer (all in mm: nacl,
114; kcl, 47; kh2po4, 1.21;  xxxd2534xxx , 1.16; nahco3, 25.5;  xxxg2125xxx ,
2h2o, 2.5; hepes, 10) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum
albumin (bsa) and incubated for 60 min in this buffer. all
wells were aspirated, and the cells were incubated for 3 h with
nn buffer, 22 mm glucose, 0.1 mm  xxxd2388xxx , and serial dilutions
of the compounds. a reference compound served as positive
control. a test for responsiveness toward a series of glucose
concentrations was included in every assay to ensure functionality. the supernatant from each well was harvested, and
insulin content was measured by an in-house enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (elisa) using guinea pig antiinsulin
antibodies and a rat insulin as standard. the results were
analyzed in prism (graphpad software) and expressed as ic50
and emax (the maximum inhibition obtained  xxxd1891xxx  µm of the
compound). sem was calculated for all compounds.
(b) inhibition of glucose-induced insulin release in
wistar rat islets. islets were isolated by collagenase and
gradient centrifugation in  xxxd3253xxx  gradient (40-13%). isolated
islets were incubated in bulk overnight in rpmi, 10% fcs,
and 11 mm glucose. the islets were handpicked and placed
 xxxd1891xxx  islets/microtiter well and cultured overnight in dmem,
10% fcs, and 3 mm glucose. essentially, the islets were tested
as described for the betatc6 but with no addition of  xxxd2388xxx . the
insulin content was measured in the same elisa as used for
the betatc6 cells.
relaxation of precontracted smooth muscle in vitro.
(a) aorta and bladder. female wistar rats weighing approximately 150-200 g were killed by cervical dislocation, and
the thoracic aorta or bladder body was removed. aorta and
bladder were cut into rings of approximately 5 mm wide. ring
preparations were mounted in 5 ml (danish myo technology,
aarhus, denmark) or 10 ml organ baths (schuler organ bath
809, hugo sachs elektronik, germany) with a resting tension
of 2 or 0.5 g (for aorta and bladder, respectively) and bathed
in krebs ringer solution with the following composition
(mm): nacl, 118.5; nahco3, 25.0; kcl, 4.7; cacl2, 6.8; mgcl2,
2.4; and glucose, 11.1 in double-distilled water. the ringer
solution was continuously aerated with 95% o2/5% co2 at 37
°c. cumulative concentration response curves (0.1-300 µm)
were constructed for all test compounds on top of a precontraction induced either by 0.3 µm phenylephrine or 10 µm
 xxxd325xxx , in aorta and bladder, respectively. all test
compounds were freshly dissolved in dmso. potency of a
compound (ec50), with regard to producing smooth muscle
relaxation, was defined, as the concentration required obtaining a half-maximal dilating effect. ec50 was estimated for
individual concentration response curves by four parameter
nonlinear, logistic regression using myodata software (danish
myo technology, aarhus, denmark). data generated in bladder smooth muscle were corrected for time decay of the
 xxxd325xxx -induced contractile response.
(b) mesenteric resistance arteries. adult male wistar
rats (aged 12-16 weeks) were killed by a sharp blow on the
head and cervical dislocation. the mesentery was removed and
immersed in cold (4 °c) krebs ringer solution. third to fourth
order side branches were dissected from the superior mesenteric artery. arteries were chemically sympathectomized by
incubation in 6-hydroxydopamine.70 vessels were then mounted
in a wire myograph at 37 °c, in krebs ringer solution (cacl2,
2.5; kcl, 4.7; kh2po4, 1.2;  xxxd2534xxx , 1.2; nacl, 118.5; nahco3,
25.0; and glucose, 5.5, all in mm) and continuously aerated
with 95% o2/5% co2. arteries were normalized71 to find their
individual optimal lumen diameter for isometric force development. for all test compounds, cumulative concentration
response curves were constructed in vessels precontracted with
10 µm phenylephrine. data were analyzed as described above.
[3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding. hek293 cells stably expressing  xxxg19xxx / xxxg1250xxx  were grown in dmem with 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.6 mg/ml  xxxg418xxx , and 10% fcs. cells were
washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and harvested
in pbs. the cells were centrifuged at 48 000g for 10 min. the
cell pellet was homogenized in buffer (30 mm tris, ph 7.4)
using an ultra turrax homogenizer and then centrifuged at

48 000g for 10 min. the pellet was homogenized again in buffer
and centrifuged at 48 000g for 10 min. the pellet was
suspended in buffer with 250 mm sucrose by homogenization.
total protein was determined using a biorad kit. the receptor
preparation was kept in small aliquots (5 mg protein/ml) at
-80 °c until use.
receptor preparation (100 µg/ml): [3h] xxxd2215xxx  (1 nm,
new england nuclear, net1024), test compound, and assay
buffer (30 mm hepes, 2 mm mgcl2, 2 mm na2-atp, ph 7.4)
to a final volume of 250 µl was mixed. all test compounds
were dissolved in dmso and diluted in assay buffer.  xxxd2204xxx 
(10 µm) was used to determine nonspecific binding. the assay
was incubated for 1 h at 37 °c. incubation was terminated by
dilution with 4 ml of ice-cold 0.9% nacl solution, followed by
rapid filtration through whatman gf/b filters. filters were
washed with 2 × 4 ml ice-cold 0.9% nacl solution. the
radioactivity retained on the filters was dissolved with scintillation cocktail and counted using a packard scintillation
counter. ic50 values were calculated by nonlinear regression
analysis (sigmoid two site or one site) of binding data using
prism for windows 3.02, graphpad software, san diego,
california, u.s.a.
beta-cell selectivity studies after intravenous administration to rats. postprandial, adult male sprague-dawley
rats, weighing 280-320 g (m&b breeding center, ll. skensved,
denmark), were anaesthetized with a mixture of hypnorm/
 xxxd2641xxx  receiving supplemental anesthetic every 20 min.72
body temperature was maintained at 37 °c by a homeothermic
blanket system (harvard homeothermic blanket system,
harvard apparatus ltd, u.k.). a polythene cannula (pe50)
coupled to a pressure transducer (statham p23xc) and a
pressure coupler (hse 561, hugo sachs elektronik kg,
germany) was introduced into the carotid artery to measure
blood pressure (map), which was recorded continuously and
fed to a plotter (linearcorder mark vii, wr 3310, hugo sachs
elektronik kg, germany) and a computer and analyzed offline.
a polythene cannula (pe50) was inserted into the jugular vein
for drug infusion and blood sampling. after a stabilization
period, the test substances were injected as a bolus lasting
for 20 s. blood samples were drawn at 5-10 min intervals,
from 15 min preinjection until 30 min postinjection. compounds were dissolved in naoh (0.15%) and saline and were
administered in a fixed dose of 3 mg/kg rat. plasma insulin
levels were measured with in-house elisa using guinea pig
antiinsulin antibodies and rat insulin as standard.
pharmacokinetic properties in rat. the pharmacokinetic rat experiments were performed on sprague-dawley,
body weight about 180 g, rats using the cassette approach with
two compounds per cassette (n ) 2). blood sampling was done
by heart puncture and each single data point originates from
one rat. the doses administered were selected in order to
obtain linear pharmacokinetics. for intravenous administration, rats were given 0.5 mg/kg of 34, 39, 50, or  xxxd1868xxx  and
0.89 mg/kg of 30, 36, 38, or 54. for oral administration, 1.89
mg/kg of 30, 36, 37, or 53 and 2.0 mg/kg of 34, 39, 50, or
 xxxd1868xxx  were used. dosage vehicle for the compounds was
potassium phosphate buffer 0.1 m, ph 8.0, except for 34 for
which vehicle was peg 300, 20-30% in water and for
 xxxd1868xxx  the vehicle was peg 300, 40%, and cremophor, 10%,
in water. the plasma concentrations of dosed compounds were
determined by an lc/ms/ms method. the concentration-time
data sets were analyzed by noncompartmental pharmacokinetic methods based on statistical moments theory.
in vivo effect of orally administered 34 on pancreatic function in glucose-challenged rats. groups of male
sprague-dawley rats, body weight about 360 g, were fasted
overnight and dosed orally with 34 (30 mg/kg, n ) 3/group)
3-12 h prior to experimentation or with vehicle at 3 h before
(n ) 6). vehicle consisted of 1:1:4:4 (v/v) glycerol/water/0.5%
gelatine solution/10% methylhydroxypropyl-cellulose e3, and
a dose volume of 2 ml/kg was used. before administration of
a glucose challenge, rats were anaesthetized with hypnorm

glucose was injected at four different sc sites at a load of 2
g/6 ml/kg, and a second blood sample was collected 15 min
later. statistical analysis was done using one way analysis of
variance (anova) with bonferroni’s post hoc test.
in vivo measurement of cardiovascular parameters
in telemetered sprague-dawley rats. female 12-18
month mol:sprd rats (m&b ltd., ll.) weighing 250-350 g
were used. for insertion of the telemetry probe, which was
done at least 2 months before the start of the experiments,
each rat was anaesthetized with isofluran. the abdomen of
the rat was opened with a 3-5 cm long incision. a catheter
was inserted in the aorta (1.5 cm), and the catheter was sealed
to the aorta by the use of surgical glue. hereafter, the
telemetry probe (tl11m2-c50-pxt, data sciences international, st. paul, mn) was placed in the abdomen. between and
during the study, the rats were pair-housed (only one rat with
sensor) in type iii cages with aspen bedding. the rats were
fed altromin 1324 (brogaarden, gentofte, denmark) and water
ad libitum. lights were on from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm with no
twilight periods, and room air was changed 8-15 times per
hour.
data acquisition was performed by using ponemah and
cardiovascular parameters, and body temperature was followed continuously throughout the experiment. mean values
(every 30 min) were calculated.
