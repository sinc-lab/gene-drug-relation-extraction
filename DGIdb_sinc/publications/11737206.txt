serine hydroxymethyltransferase (shmt) is a member of
the fold type i family of  xxxd3049xxx -dependent enzymes, a
group of evolutionarily related proteins that share the same
overall fold. the reaction catalysed by shmt, the transfer
of cb of serine to  xxxd3334xxx  ( xxxd3334xxx ),
represents in the cell an important link between the
breakdown of amino acids and the metabolism of folates. in
the absence of  xxxd3334xxx  and when presented with
appropriate substrate analogues, shmt shows a broad
range of reaction specificity, being able to catalyse at
appreciable rates retroaldol cleavage, racemase, aminotransferase and decarboxylase reactions. this apparent lack
of specificity is probably a consequence of the particular
catalytic apparatus evolved by shmt. an interesting
question is whether other fold type i members that normally
catalyse the reactions which for shmt could be considered
as ‘forced errors’, may be close relatives of this enzyme and
have a catalytic apparatus with the same basic features. as
shown in this study, l - xxxg2069xxx  from escherichia
coli is able to catalyse the same range of reactions catalysed

by shmt, with the exception of the serine hydroxymethyltransferase reaction. this observation strongly suggests that
shmt and l - xxxg2069xxx  are closely related enzymes
specialized for different functions. an evolutionary analysis
of the fold type i enzymes revealed that shmt and
l - xxxg2069xxx  may actually belong to a subgroup of
closely related proteins; fungal alanine racemase, an
extremely close relative of l - xxxg2069xxx , also
appears to be a member of the same subgroup. the
construction of three-dimensional homology models of
l - xxxg2069xxx  from e. coli and alanine racemase
from cochliobolus carbonum, and their comparison with
the shmt crystal structure, indicated how the tetrahydrofolate binding site might have evolved and offered a starting
point for further investigations.

during the past decade, the understanding of the
evolutionary relationships amongst  xxxd3049xxx -dependent
enzymes and of the structural basis of their mechanistic
diversity and uniformity have increased markedly [1,2]. the
progress in this field has been greatly aided by the raising
numbers of sequences and three-dimensional structures that
have become available. although there are five evolutionarily unrelated families of b6 enzymes, each having a
completely different fold [3–5], the whole range of diverse
reaction specificity [6] is covered by the largest and best
characterized family known as the a family [1], fold type i
[3], or the aspartate aminotransferase family [4]. this family
therefore offers an opportunity to understand how distinct
catalytic properties that exploit the chemical reactivity of a
single coenzyme and a common protein scaffold have
evolved. one member of this family, serine hydroxymethyltransferase (shmt), whose crystallographic structure has
been determined from several sources [7–10], shows a
particularly broad reaction specificity. although there is little
doubt that the role of shmt in vivo is to catalyse the
reversible transfer of cb of serine to  xxxd3334xxx  ( xxxd3334xxx ) to form glycine and 5,10-methyleneh4pteglu, in vitro and in the absence of  xxxd3334xxx , shmt
also catalyses decarboxylation, transamination, retroaldol
cleavage and racemization reactions (table 1), at rates

it is clear that shmt, alone amongst the members of the
fold type i family, has acquired a folate binding site. some
discussion on this aspect has been made between
escherichia coli shmt and aspartate aminotransferase
[9]. however, these two members of the fold type i family
are too distantly related to offer a meaningful comparison.
our comparative study of shmt and the closely related
l - xxxg2069xxx  and fungal alanine racemase was
undertaken in the hope that it would reveal how evolution
created the folate site and how alternative catalytic activities
were repressed or enhanced.

materials
sometimes approaching and even exceeding those of the
physiological reaction [11,12]. this makes shmt and the
related enzymes that catalyse similar reactions a good
system for revealing the structural factors controlling
reaction specificity. the particular reaction catalysed by
shmt is mainly determined by the structure of the aminoacid substrate. with the true substrates, serine or glycine,
shmt catalyses none of the alternate reactions. the
currently accepted model attributes this reaction specificity
to the existence of open and closed active site conformations. the physiological substrates generate the closed
conformation, whereas alternate substrates react while the
enzyme remains in open conformation, which permits
reaction paths leading to decarboxylation, transamination
and racemization [13].
 xxxg2069xxx  activity detected in cell extracts has
long been attributed to shmt because it had been observed
when pure cytosolic shmt from rabbit liver and threonine
were mixed in vitro [14]. recently, it has been proved that in
some microbial organisms  xxxg2069xxx  is a distinct
enzyme [15]. however, although shmt from some
mammalian livers slowly cleaves threonine, there is no
 xxxg2069xxx  activity in rat liver [16] and mammals are
believed to lack the genuine  xxxg2069xxx  enzyme.
several orthologous genes encoding threonine adolase from
various microbial sources have been cloned and expressed
[15]. their protein products are capable of cleaving both
l -threonine and l -allo-threonine (and in this case are called
low-specificity l -threonine aldolases; l -tas) or are highly
specific for l -allo-threonine (l -allo-tas). it has been also
recognized that l -tas belong to the fold type i family
[1,15]. moreover, in recent years, a  xxxd3049xxx -dependent
alanine racemase from two different fungal organisms was
isolated that shows a strong sequence similarity to l -tas
from many species [17–19]. fungal alanine racemases are
unrelated at the level of the primary structure to any known
bacterial alanine racemase (fold type iii) [4]. we became
interested in l -ta and fungal alanine racemase because
they normally catalyse reactions which for shmt may
be considered as ‘forced errors’. a comparison of these
enzymes with shmt may give important clues to the origin
of the reaction and substrate specificity in fold type i
enzymes. in the study reported here, we provide evidence
that the e. coli l -ta is a close relative of e. coli shmt,
exhibiting very similar spectral and catalytic properties. a
theoretical study, based on sequence comparison, homology
modelling and structural analysis, supports this interpretation and tentatively extends it to fungal alanine racemase.

ingredients for bacterial growth were from difco.
chemicals for the purification of the enzymes were
from  xxxg257xxx , deae-sepharose and phenyl-sepharose from
pharmacia biotech. l -lactic dehydrogenase, alcohol
dehydrogenase, l -alanine dehydrogenase and d -aminoacid oxidase were from sigma –aldrich. shmt from
e. coli was expressed and purified as previously described
[20]. the oliglonucleotides primers used in the pcr
reaction were from integrated dna technologies, inc.
(coralville, ia, usa). (6s)- xxxd3334xxx  was a gift from a. g.
eprova, schaffhausen, switzerland. all other reagents were
from sigma–aldrich.
cloning of the gene encoding  xxxg2069xxx 
the coding sequence of the ltae gene, encoding the e. coli
low-specificity l - xxxg2069xxx  (eta) [21], was
obtained from the genomic dna of the e. coli k-12 strain
by pcr amplification, using an expand high fidelity pcr
system (roche diagnostics corporation, indianapolis, in,
usa) and the following oligonucleotides were used as
primers: upstream primer, 50 -aggacatcatatgattga
tttacgcagtga-30 ; downstream primer, 50 -cgtctga
attcttaacgcgccaggaatg-30 . nde i and eco ri
restriction sites, underlined in the sequences, were
introduced to allow insertion into a pet22b(þ) plasmid
vector (novagen, inc., madison, wi, usa). this construct
was used to transform e. coli hms174 (de3) strain cells
(novagen, inc.). the nucleotide sequence of the insert was
determined to confirm that no mismatching had occurred
during the pcr amplification.
purification of  xxxg2069xxx 
an overnight culture (30 ml) of hms174 (de3) cells,
transformed with the l - xxxg2069xxx  overexpressing
plasmid, was inoculated (1 : 200) into 6 l of luria – bertani
broth containing ampicillin (100 mg·l21) and  xxxd3049xxx 
(30 mg·l21). bacteria were grown aerobically at 37 8c to
exponential phase ( xxxd600xxx  ¼ 0.3– 0.4), then expression of
eta was induced with 0.05 mm isopropyl thio-b-d -galactoside (iptg). bacteria were harvested after 20 h and
suspended in 10 mm tris/hcl, 1 mm nacl, 1 mm edta,
ph 7.6. cell lysis was carried out by the addition of 1 mg of
lysozyme per g of packed bacterial cells and incubation
for 20 min at room temperature. streptomycin sulfate
(10 g·l21) was added to precipitate dna. the cell extract

6510 r. contestabile et al. (eur. j. biochem. 268)

was then centrifuged at 15 000 g for 30 min and the pellet
was discarded. solid ammonium sulfate was added to the
cell extract to 50% of saturation (313 g·l21). the solution
was centrifuged at 15 000 g for 20 min and the pellet was
discarded. ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant
to 75% saturation (176 g·l21). after centrifugation, the
precipitate was dissolved in 20 mm potassium phosphate,
ph 7.5, and dialysed against two 3-l changes of the same
buffer. the dialysed material was added to a deaesepharose column (5 £ 15 cm) that had been equilibrated
with 20 mm potassium phosphate, ph 7.5. the column was
washed with 100 ml of the equilibrating buffer. the
enzyme was then eluted with a 1-l linear gradient of
0–0.4 m nacl in 20 mm phosphate buffer, ph 7.5. the
fractions with the highest a420/a280 ratio were collected and
the protein was precipitated by the addition of ammonium
sulfate to 75% saturation. after centrifugation, the pellet
was dissolved in an equal volume of 50 mm potassium
phosphate, ph 7.0, and loaded on a phenyl-sepharose
column (4 £ 15 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer
containing ammonium sulfate to 30% saturation
(176 g·l21). elution was carried out with a 600-ml linear
gradient from the equilibrating buffer to 20 mm potassium
phosphate, ph 7.0. the fractions showing a single band on
sds/page were pooled and concentrated by ammonium
sulfate precipitation, followed by dialysis in 20 mm
potassium phosphate at ph 7.0.
spectral and kinetic studies
with serine and  xxxd3334xxx  as substrates, the rate of
5,10-methylene- xxxd3334xxx  production was determined by
oxidizing this compound to 5,10-methenyl- xxxd3334xxx , using
nadpþ and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase. the
initial rate of the reaction, carried out in 20 mm potassium
phosphate ph 7.2 at 30 8c, was calculated from the
absorbance change at 340 nm due to nadph formation,
using a value of 1340 ¼ 7200 m 21·cm21 [22]. the reaction
mixture included either eshmt (0.1 mm ) or eta (34 mm ).
the dependence of the initial velocity of the reaction
on  xxxd3334xxx  concentration was determined maintaining
l -serine at 30 mm and varying  xxxd3334xxx  concentration
between 5 mm and 450 mm . the formaldehyde produced
from the retroaldol cleavage of l -serine catalysed by eta
was measured incubating the enzyme with 150 mm l -serine
for a definite period of time and then adding 500 mm
 xxxd3334xxx , 0.2 mm nadpþ and methylenetetrahydrofolate
dehydrogenase (200 mg·ml21) to the reaction mixture. the
spontaneous condensation between formaldehyde and the
oxidation of the product 5,10-ch2- xxxd3334xxx  by nadpþ,
resulted in a burst of absorbance at 340 nm, due to
formation of nadph, from which the formaldehyde
produced during the incubation with eta was measured.
km and kcat values for l -serine cleavage were determined
using the standard assay for shmt, holding  xxxd3334xxx 
concentration constant at 500 mm and varying l -serine
concentration from 0.33 mm to 90 mm . under these
conditions, the spontaneous reaction of formaldehyde with
 xxxd3334xxx  was not rate-limiting.
the rate of threonine cleavage was measured by coupling
the reaction with reduction of the product acetaldehyde
by nadh and  xxxg110xxx  [23]. the rate of the
reaction was calculated from the rate of disappearance in

q febs 2001

absorbance at 340 nm, using a value of 1340 ¼ 6220 cm21·
21
m . benzaldehyde production from phenylserine cleavage
was measured spectrophotometrically at 279 nm, employing
a molar absorption value of 1279 ¼ 1400 cm21·m 21 [24].
both retroaldol cleavage reactions were carried out in
20 mm potassium phosphate, ph 7.0, at 30 8c.
the rate of exchange of the a-protons of glycine with
solvent protons was determined by incubating 0.03 mm
[2-3h]glycine (2.2 £ 106 c.p.m.) with eta (5 –30 mm ) in
20 mm potassium phosphate, ph 7.2, at 30 8c and
determining the amount of 3h2o formed in a 15-min
incubation [25]. the effect of  xxxd3334xxx  on the rate of
exchange was determined by adding 0.5 mm  xxxd3334xxx  to
the reaction solution.
the pseudo first-order rate constants of transamination
of d - and l -alanine were determined by measuring the
disappearance of absorbance at either 498 nm or 420 nm,
during the conversion of the enzyme-bound pyridoxal-50 phosphate (plp) to pyridoxamine-50 -phosphate (pmp)
[12]. each reaction was carried out in 50 mm
sodium n,n-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonate
(nabes), ph 7.6, at 37 8c and contained 37 mm eta and
210 mm alanine. after completion of the reaction with
d -alanine, the enzyme was separated from the small
molecules using a 10-kda cut-off centrifugal concentrator
(microseptm, filtron technology corporation, northborough,
ma, usa). an aliquot of the filtrate was used to measure
the pyruvate produced in the transamination reaction by
reducing it to lactate using nadh and lactate dehydrogenase. the pyruvate concentration was calculated from the
change in absorbance at 340 nm. other aliquots of the same
sample were used for the spectrophotometric identification
of the pmp produced in the transamination reaction and
released from the enzyme. absorption spectra were
measured in either 0.1 m naoh or 0.1 m hcl. the apparent
kd for both alanine enantiomers were determined by
titrating enzyme with increasing concentrations of
alanine and determining the maximum absorbance at
498 nm for the formation of the quinonoid intermediate.
the kd was determined from a best fit of the values of da498
to eqn (2).
racemization reactions of d - and l -alanine were carried
out in 50 mm nabes, ph 7.6, at 37 8c. the reaction
mixture contained 30 mm enzyme, 200 mm d - or l -alanine
and 1 mm plp in a volume of 0.5 ml. a control reaction
contained no enzyme. at various time intervals, 45-ml
aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed and the
reaction was stopped by the addition of 160 mm hclo4. the
solution was neutralized by adding an equivalent amount
of koh and centrifuged to remove the precipitated protein
and kclo4. the sample was then assayed for either d - or
l -alanine. the assay for l -alanine consisted of 10 mm
nadþ, 0.2 m hydrazine, sample and 5 u of l -alanine
dehydrogenase in 100 mm sodium borate ph 9.5. the
change in absorbance at 340 nm due to reduction of nadþ
was used to calculate the concentration of l -alanine
produced. for the l ! d direction, d -amino-acid oxidase
and lactate dehydrogenase were used as the coupling
enzymes. in the assay, the sample deriving from the reaction
mixture was mixed with 0.2 mm nadh and 5 u of lactate
dehydrogenase in 20 mm nabes ph 7.0. under these
conditions, the pyruvate produced from alanine in the
transamination reaction catalysed by eta was converted into

lactate. addition of 1.5 u of d -amino-acid oxidase then
converted the d -alanine produced in the racemization
reaction into pyruvate and the latter into lactate with the
simultaneous consumption of nadh. the concentration of
d -alanine in the sample was calculated from the decrease in
absorbance at 340 nm observed after addition of d -aminoacid oxidase. all enzymes used in the assays were dialysed
against either 100 mm sodium borate, ph 9.5, or 20 mm
nabes, ph 7.0, and mixed with 50% glycerol before use.
all spectral and kinetic studies were carried out on a
hewlett –packard 8452 a diode array spectrophotometer.
kinetic data analysis, curve-fitting procedures and statistical
analysis were performed using the data manipulation

multiple sequence alignment and evolutionary analysis
sixteen l -ta and two alarac sequences from various
sources were extracted from the swiss-prot databank
[26]. a multiple sequence alignment was obtained employing the program clustalw [27]. this alignment was then
used for the secondary structure prediction (phd server
[28]), and for detection of evolutionary conserved residues
[29]. psi -blast [30] was used to find distantly related
sequences of known three-dimensional structure from
the genpept database [31], using the e. coli low-specificity
 xxxg2069xxx  sequence as probe. ten threedimensional structures of fold type i b6 enzymes were
selected and retrieved from the pdb brookhaven databank
(pdb codes: 1dfo, e. coli shmt [9]; 1bs0, e. coli 8-amino7-oxononanoate synthase [32]; 1b9h, amycolatopsis mediterranei 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid synthase [33];
1ars, e. coli aspartate aminotransferase [34,35]; 1cl1,
e. coli cystathionine b-lyase [36]; 1qj5, e. coli diaminopelargonic acid synthase [37]; 2dkb, pseudomonas cepacia
dialkylglycine decarboxylase [38]; 4gsa, synechococcus sp.
glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminomutase [39]; 1bjn, e. coli
 xxxg1856xxx  [40]; 2tpl, citrobacter
freundii tyrosine-phenol lyase [41]). a multiple alignment
of the monomeric three-dimensional structures was
performed and the structurally conserved regions (scrs)
were identified. scrs consisted of regions of secondary
structure with similar local conformation, with a root mean
square deviation (rmsd) of the equivalent a-carbon positions
# 3 å and composed of at least three consecutive residues.
the rmsd values were calculated on the multiple alignment
using the homology package in insight ii (biosym/msi,
1995, san diego, ca, usa). the final sequence alignment
amongst the scrs of eta, cochliobolus carbonum alanine
racemase (calarac) and the 10 fold type i enzymes was
manually performed optimizing the matching of several
characteristics including the observed and predicted
secondary elements, the hydrophobic regions in the threedimensional structures, the residue similarity measured by
the pam 250 mutational matrix, the structurally and
functionally conserved residues, the scrs, the insertion and

deletions in the structures. the homology package in
was used for the manipulation of alignments. a
phylogenetic tree was constructed on the basis of the
sequence similarity in the scrs of the large domain of all
proteins, using the modules protdist, kitsch and drawgram of the phylip program [42], available at the pasteur
institute server (http://bioweb.pasteur.fr).

model construction and evaluation
the choice of distant templates for a model construction
produced by spatial restraint methods should be made
carefully to obtain reliable results [43,44]. e. coli shmt
and 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase and citrobacter
freundii tyrosine-phenol lyase were chosen as templates to
model eta and cochliobolus carbonum alarac. this
choice was made on the basis of the structural and
evolutionary similarity of the templates and the sequence
similarity of the latter to the target sequences. protein
dimeric models were constructed using the modeller -4
package [45]. ten different models were built for each target
protein and evaluated using several criteria. the model
displaying the lowest objective function [44], which
measures the extent of violation of constraints from the
templates, was taken as the representative model. superimposition and rmsd calculation of ca traces of the 10
models were performed to detect the most variable and
therefore less reliable modelled regions. these invariably
corresponded to loop elements. procheck [46] was used to
monitor the stereochemical quality of the eta and calarac
representative models, whereas prosaii [47] was used to
measure the overall protein quality in packing and solvent
exposure. the geometrical properties of the representative
models were within the accepted ranges. the prosaii
method indicated consistent scores for almost all regions,
except around sequence position 110 in eta (large
domain). this corresponds to a variable structural element
amongst the templates used for modelling, represented by
a solvent exposed loop region, distant from the active site.
the low score could be a result of local misfolding of
this loop.
analysis of eshmt substrate specificity
the plp – glycine complex in the eshmt threedimensional structure (which is in the form of a plp–
glycine – 5-formyl- xxxd3334xxx  ternary complex [9]) was
converted into l -allo-threonine, l -threonine and l -erythro3-phenylserine –plp complexes, using the builder package from insight ii . the x1 angle of each substrate (the
dihedral angle defined by the n, ca, cb and og1 atoms of
the substrate) was then rotated by 3608 in ten 368 steps, in
order to explore the potential energy surface within the
active site pocket. each different conformation of the plp–
substrate – eshmt complex was subjected to energy
minimization and molecular dynamics. all eshmt atoms
were fixed, except those interacting with the substrate side
chain as this was rotated (from thr520 to glu690 , from
val2560 to leu2650 , leu127 and val133). the plp–
substrate complex was also subjected to a tethering force of
418.4 kj·mol21. a cff91 force field, a distance-dependent
dielectric constant, a cut-off distance of 40 å and a 1-fs
time-step were used during the simulation. an initial

minimization was performed, for 500 steepest descent steps,
followed by conjugated gradient minimization until the
maximum energy derivative was less than 0.0418 kj·mol21.
the complex was then equilibrated for 100 steps at 3008k
and the dynamic simulation performed for 10 000 steps at
the same temperature. the total energy of the system was
monitored for the entire simulation. at the end of the
simulation, the system was subjected to energy minimization using 500 steepest descent steps, followed by
conjugated gradient minimization until the maximum
energy derivative was less than 0.0418 kj·mol21. the
final energy of the system, for each different conformation,
was taken as the potential energy associated to the
plp–substrate –eshmt complex conformation analysed.
discover 2.9 and analysis packages from insight ii were
used for minimization and molecular dynamics.

shmt activity and retroaldol cleavage of l -serine. when
eta was assayed for serine hydroxymethyltransferase
activity, mixing the enzyme at a relatively high concentration (34 mm , i.e. 300-fold higher than that of eshmt
in the standard assay) with 30 mm l -serine and 400 mm
 xxxd3334xxx , a measurable production of 5,10-methyleneh4pteglu (5,10-ch2- xxxd3334xxx ) was observed. the dependence of the initial rate of the reaction on  xxxd3334xxx 
concentration apparently conformed to the michaelis –
menten equation and proved to be quite different from that
observed with eshmt (fig. 1). with eshmt, the initial
velocity of the reaction decreased at concentrations of
 xxxd3334xxx  higher than 70 mm ; these data fitted well to
eqn (1), which accounts for uncompetitive substrate
inhibition, with best-fit values of kcat ¼ 574 ^ 100 min21,
km ¼ 40 ^ 10 mm and ki ¼ 83 ^ 22 mm , where km is
actually the apparent michaelis –menten constant measured

was measured with either 0.1 mm eshmt (x) or 34 mm eta (k) after
mixing of the enzyme with 30 mm l -serine and different concentrations
of  xxxd3334xxx  in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, ph 7.2, at 30 8c.

shmt-glycine binary complex.
the drastically different behaviour observed with the two

to the presence of a small contaminant of eshmt. however,
we noticed that the apparent km for  xxxd3334xxx  measured
with eta decreased systematically as the concentration of
enzyme employed in the assays was reduced. this
suggested that  xxxd3334xxx  was engaged in a reaction that
did not take place on the enzyme.  xxxd3334xxx  is known
to react spontaneously with formaldehyde to give
5,10-ch2- xxxd3334xxx  [48]. in our experiments, the rate
of 5,10-ch2- xxxd3334xxx  production was measured by
oxidizing this compound to 5,10-methenyl- xxxd3334xxx ,
using nadpþ and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase. this assay cannot discriminate between an enzymecatalysed hydroxymethyltransferase reaction and an
enzyme-catalysed retroaldol cleavage of l -serine followed
by the spontaneous reaction of the product formaldehyde
with  xxxd3334xxx . an experiment conducted in the absence of
 xxxd3334xxx , in which the formaldehyde produced from the
cleavage of serine was measured, demonstrated that
5,10-ch2- xxxd3334xxx  formed spontaneously in the previous
experiments and that  xxxd3334xxx  has no effect on the rate of
retroaldol cleavage reaction (fig. 1, inset). we were unable
to measure any  xxxg2069xxx  activity with eshmt,
employing the same assay conditions and methodology for
detection of formaldehyde adopted for eta (see methods
section).

retroaldol cleavage of 3-hydroxyamino acids. eta is active
towards both  xxxd2033xxx  and threo isomers of l -threonine and
l -3-phenylserine [21]. the effect of ph on the initial
velocity of l -allo-threonine cleavage was examined
between ph 5.5 and 9.0, at 30 8c and in the presence of
165 mm substrate. the maximum activity of the enzyme
was around ph 7.0. the kinetic parameters of this and other
retroaldol cleavage reactions catalysed by eta were then
calculated from experiments carried out at ph 7.0 (table 2).
eta is 60- to 100-fold more efficient as a catalyst (in terms
of kcat/km) than eshmt in the cleavage of the hydroxyamino substrates tested. both eta and eshmt show a clear
preference for the  xxxd2033xxx  isomer of threonine, being
330-fold and 200-fold, respectively, more efficient in the
cleavage of l -allo-threonine.

scheme 1. proposed mechanism for the
retroaldol cleavage, transamination and
racemization reactions catalysed by eshmt
and eta. the scheme, which is inspired to that
previously proposed by shostak & schirch [12]
for the racemization of alanine catalysed by
eshmt, explains how the presence of two basic
residues ( – b: and lys-nh2) at the active site of a
generic plp-dependent 3-hydroxyamino-acid
aldolase may be also responsible for the catalysis
of racemization and transamination reactions.
reaction intermediates are viewed along the
ca–n bond of the amino acid– plp complexes.
the plp ring, which is perpendicular to the plane
of the page, is represented as a grey bar.

fig. 2. effect of ph on the absorption spectrum of the l -threonine
aldolase-glycine complex. the enzyme (15 mm ) was mixed with
100 mm glycine in buffer (20 mm na/mes, 20 mm na/hepes and
20 mm na/ches) at various ph values (numbers on the curves). the
inset shows the absorption spectrum of the enzyme at ph 7.6.
the change of ph had no substantial effects on the spectrum of the
unliganded enzyme.

spectra of enzyme–glycine complexes. the addition of
glycine to eta resulted in the formation of three absorption
bands with peaks at 342, 420 and 492 nm, respectively. as
shown in fig. 2, the relative intensities of these absorption
bands are sensitive to ph. a similar observation was first
reported for rabbit liver shmt [49]. with shmt, the effect
of ph suggested that the three bands correspond to three
interconverting enzyme-glycine adducts at equilibrium:
the geminal diamine of glycine and enzyme-bound plp
(342 nm), the protonated form of the schiff base between
glycine and plp (420 nm) and a quinonoid structure
(492 nm), in which one of the a-protons of glycine has been
lost (intermediate iia in scheme 1). the value of kd for
glycine (20 mm ) was calculated according to eqn (2), from
titration experiments in which the maximum intensity of the
absorbance at 492 nm was measured upon addition of
different concentrations of glycine.

d - or l -alanine. when 15 mm enzyme (—) was mixed with 210 mm
either d -alanine ( – – –) or l -alanine (· · ·) in 50 mm na/bes, at ph 7.6,
the appearance of a variably intense absorption band with a maximum at
498 nm was observed. inset. spectra of l - xxxg2069xxx  with

addition of d -alanine.

rate of exchange of glycine a-protons with solvent protons.
in the retroaldol cleavage of 3-hydroxyamino acids, the
hydroxyalkyl group of the substrate is replaced by the
pro-2s proton of glycine (scheme 1, path a). as expected
and as previously observed with shmt [50,51], eta
catalysed the exchange of the a-protons of glycine with the
protons of the solvent. kcat/km for this reaction was similar
to that measured for eshmt in the absence of  xxxd3334xxx 
(table 2).  xxxd3334xxx  binding to eshmt is known to increase
dramatically both the rate and the stereospecificity of
the a-protons exchange [52], raising kcat/km 3700-fold
(table 2). inclusion of 0.5 mm  xxxd3334xxx  in the reaction
catalysed by eta did not affect the rate of proton exchange.
transamination of d - and l -alanine. shmt is slowly
inactivated by both d - and l -alanine shmt [12,53]. this
inactivation is the result of transamination between alanine
and plp to give pyruvate and pmp, which is loosely bound
to the enzyme and dissociates from it generating the apoform. addition of either d - or l -alanine to eta resulted in
the rapid formation of enzyme – substrate complexes
absorbing at 420 and 498 nm, whose concentration
decreased with time as a new compound absorbing at
324 nm appeared (fig. 3). this compound, which was
easily separated from the enzyme in nearly stoichiometric

q febs 2001

amounts using a centrifugal concentrator, had the same
spectral characteristics of pmp in acid and base [54].
precipitation of the enzyme was observed as the
transamination reaction proceeded. the precipitated
enzyme had lost its yellow colour, suggesting it was
apoenzyme. a nearly stoichiometric amount of pyruvate
with respect to enzyme was formed when the reaction
reached equilibrium. the pseudo-first-order rate constant of
the reaction was measured by following the disappearance
of absorbance at either 420 or 498 nm. kd values for d - and
l -alanine (table 2) were calculated according to eqn (2),
from titration experiments in which the maximum intensity
of the absorbance at 498 nm was measured upon addition of
different concentrations of alanine. these values of kd may
be assumed to correspond to the km values for the
transamination and racemization reactions (see below).
although kcat and km values for transamination differ
somewhat between eta and eshmt, the values of kcat/km
are very similar.
racemization of d - and l -alanine. as the quinonoid
intermediate formed in the half-transamination reaction of
d - and l -alanine (intermediates iib and iiib in scheme 1) is
symmetric with respect to both amino acid and cofactor, the
racemization of alanine was expected to be catalysed by
eta. indeed, initial rate studies showed that eta does
catalyse the racemization of alanine starting with either
enantiomer (table 2). kcat values for both reactions are
similar to those measured with eshmt [12] and, as
observed with eshmt, are faster than the catalytic constants
for transamination. however, the lower affinity of eta for
both l - and d -alanine makes this enzyme somewhat less
efficient in terms of kcat/km than eshmt in the racemization
reaction.

evolutionary context

a detailed, spatial analysis of the structural and possibly
evolutionary relationships amongst fold type i enzymes with
known three-dimensional structures, groups the members
of this family into eight subclasses [5,37]. in the absence of
three-dimensional structures for l - xxxg2069xxx  and
fungal alanine racemase (alarac), an evaluation of the
evolutionary relationships between these enzymes and the
fold type i members had to rely on sequence comparisons.
however, it seemed appropriate to restrict this analysis to
segments which have similar spatial conformation in the
enzymes of known three-dimensional structure (structurally
conserved regions, scrs), excluding the intervening regions
whose structure differs markedly in different enzymes.
scrs were evidently subjected to similar constraints during
evolution, therefore the comparison of their sequences may

amongst different enzymes.
amino-acid sequences of 16 l -tas and two alaracs
were aligned (fig. 4). a multiple alignment of 10
three-dimensional structures of prokaryotic enzymes was

also produced. these were selected so as to include at least
one representative of each subclass with the exception of the
prokaryotic  xxxg1626xxx  subclass. this enzyme
was excluded from the analysis because its monomer is
composed of five sequential folding domains, only one of

6516 r. contestabile et al. (eur. j. biochem. 268)

which is structurally similar to the major of the two domains
present in all fold type i enzymes [55]. the multiple
alignment led to the identification of 24 scrs (as defined in
materials and methods), most of which corresponded to
secondary structure elements (fig. 5a). the secondary

racemase (calarac) were then matched to the scrs of the
fold type i enzymes, taking into account their predicted
secondary structure, the dayhoff evolutionary mutation
scoring matrix (pam 250 matrix) and the position of the
functionally and structurally conserved residues that
characterize the fold type i enzymes [1,3,56], i.e. the
aromatic residue that stacks to the re side of plp and the
aspartate that binds to the pyridine nitrogen of the cofactor
(fig. 5a). in our alignment, a glycine residue at the
n-terminal region, positioned at the beginning of the fourth
scr, is also conserved and it is located in the so called
glycine rich region of the fold type i enzymes, corresponding to a polypeptide loop which binds the cofactor
phosphate [3]. as the greatest similarity in topology was
seen, as expected, in the large domain, only the corresponding scrs of the alignment (the first 19 scrs) were
used to calculate a distance matrix from which a phylogenetic tree was built (fig. 6). the evolutionary relationships emerging from our analysis coincide with the
structural relationships proposed by käck et al. [37] on
the ground of a spatial alignment of the scrs and calculated
by an alignment score of root mean square deviation (rmsd)
of the equivalent a-carbon positions. in addition, our
analysis suggests a possible evolutionary route for shmt,
8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase (aons, a member of
the a-oxoamine synthases subgroup, enzymes which use
derivatives of the coa as second substrate), 3-amino5-hydroxybenzoic acid synthase (ahbs), fungal alanine
racemase and l - xxxg2069xxx . according to our
analyses, the top seven taxa in fig. 6 could be arbitrarily
clustered in a subgroup including enzymes which catalyse
a-replacement and v-aminotransferase reactions. within
this subgroup, the enzyme that is most similar to l -ta and
alarac, as indicated by the percentage of identity between
l -ta and the other enzymes (fig. 6), is shmt. the hypothesis that shmt, l -ta and alarac racemase belong to a
subgroup of strictly related enzymes, suggested by the
experimental evidence, is confirmed and reinforced by these
considerations.

glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminomutase (2.93 å), eshmt
and dialkylglycine decarboxylase (3.48 å) or eshmt and
diaminopelargonic acid synthase (3.05 å). these considerations prompted the decision to build the eta and calarac
homology models using e. coli shmt and 8-amino7-oxononanoate synthase crystal structures as templates.
moreover, the three-dimensional structure of citrobacter
freundii tyrosine-phenol lyase (tpl) was also used as a
template because of its similarity with eshmt and local
sequence identity with eta and calarac. the very low
sequence identity among eta, calarac and the templates
(15.6% maximum, between eta and eshmt), required a
detailed structural analysis for model construction, mostly
based on the scrs alignment previously obtained (fig. 5b;
see materials and methods for details).
the homology models were very similar to each other,
apart from minor differences in surface loops and in the
identity of a few active site residues. therefore, we will refer
to eta when comparing the models to the eshmt structure,
except when significant differences between eta and
calarac are noteworthy. the superimposed ca backbone

differences reside in the n- and c-terminal regions, which
are shorter in eta, and in some of the loops connecting the

residues interacting with  xxxd3047xxx 
a clear structural similarity between eshmt and the models
is seen in the portion of the active site which interacts with
the plp cofactor (fig. 8a). table 3 lists the ligand groups to
plp atoms in the active site of the models as compared to
corresponding residues in the structural templates (eshmt,
aons and tpl). the residue that stacks to the re face of
plp in most fold type i enzymes is either tyr, phe or trp,

while in shmt and aons it is histidine. in both models, a
histidine residue occupies this position. this residue is
invariant in the l -ta and alarac aligned sequences
(fig. 4), suggesting that the evolutionary proximity of
these enzymes to shmt and aons may also appear in
this feature. it is worth noting that in aons, shmt
and probably also in l -ta and alarac, the histidine
imidazole ring lies parallel to plp, while in the class ii
aminotransferases (gsam, dgd and dapas) the re face
stacking residue packs nearly perpendicular to the cofactor
[37]. his129 in eshmt, which seems to have an important
function in stabilizing the interaction between asp200 and
the pyridinium nitrogen of plp [7], is present in alarac, but

it is absent in l -ta. however, in l -ta another histidine
residue (his164 in eta), although not structurally
equivalent to his129 of eshmt, may play the same role.
another residue involved in the stabilization of the same
interaction in eshmt, asn102, is however, conserved
throughout l -ta and alarac sequences. in eshmt, the
phenol oxygen, o-30 , of the plp pyridine ring interacts with
his203 and ser175 residues. similarly to tpl, these are

conservatively replaced in l -ta and alarac by arg and asn
or gln, respectively.

(arg308 in eta, arg354 in calarac and arg363 in

bonds the a-carboxylate of the substrate and is possibly
implicated in the conformational change observed upon
formation of the enzyme –glycine – xxxd3334xxx  ternary complex [9]. the models of eta and calarac have a
corresponding serine residue (ser6 and ser42, respectively),
which is conserved in all l -tas and alaracs aligned but is

residues, glu570 and tyr650 , seem to occupy a crucial
position and therefore play an important role in catalysis. it
was proposed that one of the two residues, which are located
on the re face of the cofactor, opposite to the plp-binding
lysine, may be the catalytic base required for the retroaldol
cleavage mechanism (scheme 1) [7]. however, subsequent
mutagenesis experiments suggested that neither glu570
nor tyr650 acts as a catalytic base. the carboxylate group
of glu570 very likely interacts with the hydroxyl group of
b-hydroxy amino-acid substrates and orients the side chain
for the retroaldol cleavage [58]. moreover, this interaction is
possibly one of the main requirements for the conformational transition that confers a definite reaction specificity
to the enzyme [13]. the role of tyr650 is unclear. it may be
responsible for the stabilization of the quinonoid intermediate forming after cleavage of the ca –cb bond [58] or
for the transition from the closed to the open form [59]. all
attempts carried out so far to identify the catalytic base in
shmt have failed. it has been proposed that an activated
water molecule at the active site may play this role [9]. in the
eta model, a lysine residue (lys222 0 ) is located
approximately in the same position occupied by glu570 in
eshmt. a lysine residue is invariantly found in this position
in all l -tas examined. on the other hand, there are no
residues in the model corresponding to tyr650 in eshmt,
which is located in an insertion respect to eta and calarac.
however, the regions flanking the insertion are highly
conserved in l -tas and do contain a tyrosine residue
(tyr300 ), which seems to occupy a position homologous to
that of tyr550 in eshmt and of the acid catalyst tyr710 in
tpl [60]. tyr300 is present in all sequences examined
except in that from arabidopsis thaliana (t00716), whose
putative identity has been attributed only on the basis of
sequence homology. this residue and asp330 , which is
invariant but according to our model it is too far (more than
5 å) from the hydroxyl group of substrates, are also likely
candidates involved in catalysis.
possible structural determinants of stereospecificity in
eta and eshmt
eshmt and eta show a high degree of specificity toward
the  xxxd2033xxx  isomer of threonine (table 2). we carried out an
investigation of the structural basis of stereospecificity in
eshmt with the purpose of extending the results obtained to
eta. the plp–glycine complex in the eshmt threedimensional structure was used as a template for the
construction of plp–substrate complexes with l -threonine,
l -allo-threonine and l - xxxd2033xxx -3-phenylserine. a number of
different conformations of each plp-substrate complex,
obtained by applying a torsional force on the ca –cb bond of
the amino-acid substrate, were explored in order to detect

the potential energy minima of the system analysed (as
detailed in materials and methods). in the case of
l -allo-threonine, several minima were found, the lowest of
which corresponded to the postulated productive substrate
conformation, in which the hydroxyl group is at hydrogen
bond distance to both glu570 and tyr650 (fig. 9). in this
conformation, the methyl group of the substrate is directed
towards a hydrophobic pocket, mainly defined by his126,
leu127, gly2620 , gly2630 and tyr550 . during the molecular
dynamics simulation, the dipeptide formed by gly2620 and
gly2630 flexed in order to better accommodate the methyl
group, as showed in fig. 9. analogous results were obtained
with l - xxxd2033xxx -3-phenylserine, with the difference that
fewer local energy minima were detected; the one
corresponding to the productive substrate conformation
was the absolute minimum. this latter conformation
coincides with that predicted by scarsdale et al. [8] for
l - xxxd2033xxx -3-phenylserine in the rabbit cytosolic shmt,
solely on the basis of the three-dimensional structure of the
enzyme. during the simulation, the bulky phenyl group
caused a more extensive flexion of the gly2620 -gly2630
dipeptide (fig. 9). the lowest energy minimum detected for
the plp – l -threonine complex presumably corresponds to
an unproductive (or less productive) conformation, in which
the methyl group is again oriented towards the hydrophobic
pocket but the hydroxyl group is directed away from glu570 ,
interacting only with tyr650 (fig. 9). the conformation in
which the hydroxyl group interacted with both glu570 and
tyr650 did not correspond to an energy minimum and had
the methyl group pointing away from the hydrophobic
pocket.
the  xxxd3334xxx  binding site
analysing the structure of the active site entrance, a major
difference is seen amongst eshmt, eta and car in the size
and shape of three polypeptide loops (fig. 10), which in
eshmt are larger and are involved in  xxxd3334xxx  binding [9].
the different size of these loops is possibly due to insertions
in eshmt (fig. 5b). the first of these insertions, extending
from asn345 to gly361 in eshmt, forms a loop that
changes conformation upon formation of the enzyme –
glycine – xxxd3334xxx  ternary complex. importantly, this loop
contains asn347, which binds to n1 and n8 of  xxxd3334xxx 
and is probably the most significant structural element in the
pteridine ring recognition. other residues (leu121 and
gly125), whose backbone carbonyls are involved in
 xxxd3334xxx  binding, are placed in the second short insertion,
extending from position 121–125. the third insertion in
eshmt (from ala560 to val710 ) makes important
interactions with the p-aminobenzoic acid ring of  xxxd3334xxx 
and possibly with its polyglutamate tail.

discussion
eshmt and eta have very similar catalytic properties,
being able to catalyse the same set of reactions, i.e the
retroaldol cleavage of several different l -3-hydroxyamino
acids, the transamination and the racemizations of d - and
l -alanine and the exchange of the a-protons of glycine with
solvent. however, the highest specificity constants (kcat/km)
are measured when eta and eshmt are tested, respectively,
for the retroaldol cleavage of l -allo-threonine and for the

6522 r. contestabile et al. (eur. j. biochem. 268)

transfer of the cb of serine to  xxxd3334xxx  (kcat/km < 2000 for
both reactions; table 2). the specificity constants measured
for the retroaldol cleavage of l -threonine isomers and
l - xxxd2033xxx -3-phenylserine are 60- to 100-fold higher with
eta. transamination, racemization and exchange of the
a-protons of glycine with solvent are catalysed much less
efficiently but at similar rates by both enzymes (table 2).
all these data suggest that eshmt and eta are closely
related enzymes specialized during evolution for different
functions. the evolutionary analysis and the structural
comparison between eshmt and the eta model carried out
in this work agree with this interpretation.
the apparent lack of specificity of eshmt and eta and
their similar catalytic properties are likely to derive from the
particular catalytic apparatus of the common ancestor of
these proteins that evolved to catalyse two different but
strictly related reactions. the basic features of this apparatus
are probably still present in the current enzymes and
represent the foundation of their similar catalytic properties.
an aldolase is thought to break the ca –cb bond of
3-hydroxyamino acids, most probably through a retroaldol
cleavage mechanism (scheme 1), leaving a quinonoid
intermediate (iia) that, in shmt, is then protonated from
the same side of the cleaved bond (scheme 1, reaction 2a),
maintaining the configuration of the a-carbon [51,52]. the
catalytic base responsible for the abstraction of a proton
from the hydroxyl group of substrates and the protonation of
the quinonoid (or the pro-2s proton abstraction from glycine
in the reverse direction) must be located on the re face of the
cofactor, opposite to the plp-binding lysine (lys229 in
eshmt, lys197 in eta and lys235 in calarac). therefore,
two basic residues should be present on the opposite faces of
plp: the plp-binding lysine and the catalytic base. the
presence of two distinct catalytic bases in shmt has been
demonstrated experimentally [12] and explains why the
enzyme shows racemase (scheme 1, reactions 1b –3b) and
aminotransferase activities with both alanine enantiomers
(scheme 1, reactions 1c –2c). it is therefore possible that
eshmt, eta and fungal alarac may act in the racemization of alanine through a similar two-base racemization
mechanism. shmt and eta evolved so as to prevent as far
as possible racemization and transamination of substrates.
analogously, subtle changes occurred during the evolution
in fungal alarac, without substantially altering the basic
structure of the active site, may have shifted the reaction
specificity in favour of a racemase activity. the two
sequences of fungal alanine racemases are only slightly
more similar to each other (41.6% of identity) than to any
l -ta examined (36.9% is the highest percentage of identity,
between alarac from tolypocladium niveum and l -ta
from candida albicans ). therefore, it does not seem
possible to distinguish alarac from l -ta solely on the basis
of sequence. all the invariant residues in l -ta sequences
are also present in alarac, except lys2220 in eta, which is
absent in alarac from t. niveum (fig. 4). moreover, eta
and calarac three-dimensional models show very strong
similarity in the structure of the active site and many of the
possibly critical residues in substrate binding and catalysis
listed above for eta have indeed the same identity and
location in alarac.
we have analysed eta and alarac homology models
with the aim of identifying possible candidates for the role
of catalytic base in these enzymes. as reported previously

q febs 2001

by käck et al. [37], the superposition of three-dimensional
structures of fold type i members reveals that the pyridine
ring of the cofactor has a similar orientation and interacts
with a portion of the active site pocket whose structure is
mainly conserved within this family of enzymes. in fact,
shmt, l -ta and alarac are very similar in this region.
fundamentally different structural areas of the active site of
fold type i enzymes are two polypeptide loops (located,
respectively, between the first and the second scrs and
between the seventeenth and the eighteenth scrs; fig. 5a)
that are invariably involved in substrate binding and
catalyses. the size, the amino-acid composition and the
overall fold of these structural elements are highly
diversified and appear to confer to the basic ensemble of
the active site of fold type i enzymes the structural
requirements necessary for substrate and reaction specificity. on the basis of these considerations, our research of
the catalytic base was focused on highly conserved residues
present on the ‘specificity loops’. three are the most likely
candidates in eta: lys2220 , tyr300 and asp330 . only the
aspartate residue is conserved in the two alarac sequences
available and correspond to asp690 in calarac (see results
for details).
in the retroaldol cleavage of threonine, the  xxxd2033xxx  form
of the substrate (l -allo-threonine) is preferred by both eta
and eshmt. in shmt, the relative specificity constant
in the cleavage of threonine isomers, although always in
favour of l -allo-threonine, varies depending on the source
of the enzyme. eshmt shows a clear preference for
l -allo-threonine, cleaving this substrate with a 200-fold
higher specificity constant (table 2). l -tas are classified as
low specificity l -tas, which cleaves both threonine
isomers, and as l -allo-tas, absolutely specific for the
 xxxd2033xxx  form [15]. however, except for l -ta from
pseudomonas sp., which does not clearly select the isomers
[61], l -allo-threonine is always the preferred substrate. for
instance, eta shows a 330-fold higher specificity constant
for l -allo-threonine cleavage (table 2). l -threo-3-phenylserine is a good substrate for both enzymes and is cleaved
with an efficiency similar to that of l -allo-threonine
cleavage. some specificity towards the configuration of the
cb of the substrates with a phenyl group is observed with
both enzymes [21,24]. the molecular dynamics simulations
of plp– substrate complexes carried out using the eshmt
crystal structure suggest that the main structural determinants of stereospecificity in this enzyme are the interactions
of the substrate hydroxyl group with the side chains of  xxxd3244xxx 
and y650 and of threonine methyl group with the
hydrophobic pocket defined by his126, leu127, gly2620 ,
gly2630 and tyr550 . the flexion of the dipeptide formed by
gly2620 and gly2630 , observed during the simulations,
appears to accommodate the cb substituent of the
hydroxyamino-acid substrate and may account for the
capability of shmt to bind and cleave efficiently substrates
with a bulky cb substituent such as the phenyl group of
3-phenylserine. the hydrophobic pocket that accommodates
the cb substituents in eshmt is similar in the eta model
and the residues that define it are mainly conserved in l -tas
(figs 4 and 5). this is an interesting clue for the explanation
of the observed preference of l -tas for l -allo-threonine.
shmt from different sources is known to catalyse, in
the absence of  xxxd3334xxx , although extremely slowly
(kcat ¼ 3–6 £ 1023 min21), the cleavage of l -serine to

q febs 2001

comparative studies on plp-dependent enzymes (eur. j. biochem. 268) 6523

glycine and formaldehyde [52,62].  xxxd3334xxx  accelerates the
rate of cleavage up to 200 000-fold, although in the presence
of this second substrate shmt actually catalyses a hydroxymethyltransferase reaction. the kcat for the exchange of the
pro-2s proton of glycine with solvent is also increased by
1100-fold when  xxxd3334xxx  is added to eshmt (table 2). all
other reactions catalysed by shmt are accelerated upon
binding of  xxxd3334xxx , although to a much lesser extent
(twofold to fourfold [12,62]). eta cleaves l -serine with a
higher kcat (1.9 min21) than that measured with shmt. this
was expected as eta was found to be a more efficient
catalyst in the cleavage of all other 3-hydroxyamino acids.
however,  xxxd3334xxx  has no effect on the rate of this reaction,
although it spontaneously combines with the product
formaldehyde, forming 5,10-ch2- xxxd3334xxx . no effect of
 xxxd3334xxx  was also observed on the rate of exchange of the
a-protons of glycine with solvent. the contribution of
 xxxd3334xxx  to catalyse and especially its involvement in the
cleavage of serine are the only substantial differences in
the properties of eshmt and eta. the most conspicuous
difference in the structures of the two enzymes appears
indeed to be related to the additional binding of  xxxd3334xxx  to
shmt. according to our analysis, the evolution of the folate
site apparently consisted in the appropriate shaping of three
polypeptide loops present at the active site entrance of
shmt, which left basically unaltered the structure of the
rest of the active site (fig. 10). one of these loops, extending for ala560 to val710 , is a ‘specificity loop’ and
contains residues that also interact with the amino-acid
substrates.
an interesting question is which enzyme, shmt or l -ta,
more closely resembles the most recent common ancestor.
this is equivalent to asking whether the capability of
transferring the serine b-carbon to  xxxd3334xxx  evolved after
that of catalysing the retroaldol cleavage or, alternatively,
l -ta originated from a more complex enzyme, to perform a
simpler, apparently minor metabolic function. useful clues
may come from structural and mechanistic considerations.
it is reasonable to suppose that evolution of reaction
specificity in b6-enzymes came before specialization for
substrate specificity [1]. indeed, the adjustment of a catalytic apparatus required to change the reaction specificity
presumably involves larger and more conditioning structural
adaptations than those necessary for a change of substrate
specificity [1]. thus, it seems plausible that the most recent
common ancestor of l -ta and shmt was able to catalyse
the retroaldol cleavage of 3-hydroxyamino acids and then
evolved the additional level of complexity that enabled it to
bind  xxxd3334xxx  and catalyse the serine hydroxymethyltransferase reaction. this hypothesis is supported by the fact that
serine cleavage is thermodynamically unfavourable compared to threonine cleavage [62,63]. in the absence of
 xxxd3334xxx , shmt catalyses the serine cleavage, although
extremely slowly, while it is able to cleave threonine and
other 3-hydroxyamino acids quite rapidly. this difference in
reactivity is attributed to the instability of the product
formaldehyde. the presence of a stabilizing electron donor
group at cb greatly accelerates the reaction [62,63]. the
participation of  xxxd3334xxx  in shmt-catalysed serine cleavage overcomes this energy barrier, driving the reaction
through a different and more favourable path. therefore, it
seems plausible that when the shmt ancestor evolved the
capability to include  xxxd3334xxx  in the reaction, it already had

to possess all the necessary requirements to be a generic
3-hydroxyamino-acid aldolase.
the comparative study between shmt and l -ta initiated
with the present work will be further developed and
extended to fungal alanine racemase. a detailed structural
and functional comparison requires the availability of the
crystal structures of l -ta and fungal alarac. however, the
three-dimensional homology models represent a good
starting point for the design of site-directed mutagenesis
experiments aimed at determining the identity of the crucial
catalytic residues.
