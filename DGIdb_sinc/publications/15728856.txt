regulator of g-protein signaling 9-2 (rgs9-2), a member of the rgs family of g␣ gtpase accelerating proteins, is expressed specifically
in the striatum, which participates in antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia and in levodopa-induced dyskinesia. we report that rgs9
knock-out mice develop abnormal involuntary movements when inhibition of dopaminergic transmission is followed by activation of
d2-like dopamine receptors (drs). these abnormal movements resemble drug-induced dyskinesia more closely than other rodent
models. recordings from striatal neurons of these mice establish that activation of d2-like drs abnormally inhibits glutamate-elicited
currents. we show that rgs9-2, via its dep domain (for disheveled, egl-10, pleckstrin homology), colocalizes with d2drs when coexpressed in mammalian cells. recordings from oocytes coexpressing  xxxg656xxx  or the m2 muscarinic receptor and g-protein-gated inward
rectifier potassium channels show that rgs9-2, via its dep domain, preferentially accelerates the termination of  xxxg656xxx  signals. thus,
alterations in rgs9-2 may be a key factor in the pathway leading from d2drs to the side effects associated with the treatment both of
psychoses and parkinson’s disease.

introduction
drugs that are effective in the treatment of psychoses (sawa and
snyder, 2002; freedman, 2003) and parkinson’s disease (dauer
and przedborski, 2003) are antagonists (antipsychotics) or agonists [dopamine/l-3,4- xxxd2471xxx  (l-dopa)], respectively, of g-protein-coupled d2-like dopamine receptors
(drs). the receptors for dopamine are members of the seven
transmembrane-spanning g-protein-coupled receptor (gpcr)
superfamily and may be classified into two subfamilies, d1-like
(d1 and d5, which activate intracellular heterotrimeric gs
g-proteins) and d2-like (d2, d3, and d4, which activate heterotrimeric, pertussis toxin-sensitive gi and go g-proteins) (missale
et al., 1998). typical antipsychotics and dopamine receptor agonists also both induce motor side effects, tardive and l-dopainduced dyskinesia, which result from their actions on d2-like

drs in the striatum, an important component of the basal ganglia
loop that controls movement. although the pathophysiology remains obscure, these motor side effects are strikingly similar with
respect to clinical phenomenology, epidemiology, and risk factors (rascol and fabre, 2001).
when an activated gpcr (e.g., dopamine-bound  xxxg656xxx ) encounters a trimeric g-protein, it catalyzes the exchange of gtp
for gdp at the ␣ subunit of the g-protein (g␣), leading to the
dissociation of the gtp-bound g␣ subunit from the g␤␥ dimer.
the activated gtp-bound g␣ subunit and the freed g␤␥ dimer
regulate the activity of diverse cellular effector molecules. signal
termination is mediated by the intrinsic gtpase activity of the
g␣, which hydrolyzes the bound gtp to gdp, allowing it to
reassociate with the g␤␥ dimer (ross and wilkie, 2000).
the gtpase activity of g␣ and hence gpcr signal termination can be enhanced by members of a family of proteins called
regulators of g-protein signaling (rgss) (berman and gilman,
1998; de vries et al., 2000; ross and wilkie, 2000). all rgs proteins have a conserved core “rgs domain” of ⬃120 amino acids,
which is necessary and sufficient for their gtpase stimulating
action. many rgs proteins also possess additional c- and
n-terminal modular protein-binding domains and motifs.
transcripts of an rgs protein, the rgs9 splice variant

rgs9-2, are confined to the striatum (thomas et al., 1998; rahman et al., 1999), the brain region involved in antipsychoticinduced tardive dyskinesia and in levodopa-induced dyskinesia.
recently, rahman et al. (2003) reported that mice with a null
mutation in the rgs9 gene showed heightened locomotor responses to cocaine and related psychostimulants and that, conversely, viral-mediated overexpression of rgs9-2, but not rgs4,
in rat striatum specifically reduced locomotor responses to  xxxg656xxx 
agonists.
the results described above prompted us to search for associations between d2drs and rgs9-2. the n termini of both rgs9
splice variants possess a highly conserved dep domain (for disheveled, egl-10, pleckstrin homology) (de vries and gist farquhar, 1999; druey, 2001). dep domains are present in many key
signaling proteins, but the function of this domain is not clear
(ponting and bork, 1996). in this study, we show that the rgs9
dep domain mediated subcellular colocalization with d2drs.
we demonstrate that such localization has functional consequences at the cellular level and implicate a role for rgs9-2 in
suppressing the extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotic treatment and the movement disorders of parkinson’s disease.

materials and methods

knock-out mice. rgs9 ⫺/⫺ mice were generated as described by chen et
al. (2000). all experimental procedures complied with national institutes of health guidelines as approved by the institutional animal care
and use committee of the california institute of technology (pasadena,
ca) or the university of leipzig (leipzig, germany).
drug treatment. reserpine, haloperidol, apomorphine, quinpirole,
skf 38393, or saline were administered intraperitoneally. reserpine (1
mg/kg), haloperidol (5 mg/kg), or saline were administered once a day
for 3 consecutive days. behavioral testing with apomorphine (1 mg/kg),
quinpirole (10 mg/kg), or skf 38393 (10 mg/kg) was performed immediately before reserpine or haloperidol treatment and 3 d after the final
injection of either drug.
recording of locomotion and abnormal involuntary movements. locomotion was measured using a cage rack system with infrared light beams
(san diego instruments, san diego, ca). single events represented disruption of two individual light beams 10 cm apart. data were recorded
for 15 min before and after drug application. the abnormal involuntary
movements (aims) were evaluated immediately after administration of
dopamine receptor agonists. the aims were classified into the following
four subtypes (cenci et al., 2002; lundblad et al., 2002): (1) axial aims
consisting of dystonic posturing and choreiform twisting of head or neck;
(2) limb movements consisting of rapid jerky movements of front limbs
or hindlimbs; (3) orofacial movements including abnormal chewing,
licking, grooming, etc.; and (4) abnormal locomotion comprising unsteady gait (secondary to dystonia), moving backwards, and jumping.
each of these four subtypes was scored on a severity scale from 0 to 4 (1,
present during ⬍25% of the observation time; 2, present between 25 and
50% of the observation time; 3, present between 50 and 75% of the
observation time; and 4, present ⬎75% of the observation time).
electrophysiology in acute striatal slices. anesthetized (halothane) mice
(postnatal days 10 –25) were decapitated, and brains were placed in an
ice-cold artificial csf (acsf). coronal slices (300 ␮m thick) containing
striatum and globus pallidus were cut with a vt1000s vibratome (leica,
nussloch, germany) and stored in bubbled acsf with kynurenic acid (1
␮m) for 30 min and without kynurenic acid for at least an additional 30
min. during recordings, slices were perfused with acsf (containing, in
mm: 126 nacl, 2.5 kcl, 2 cacl2, 1 mgcl2, 1.25 nah2po4, 26 nahco3,
25 d-glucose, ph 7.3, bubbled with 95% o2 and 5% co2) at 32–33°c.
more than 90% of striatal neurons are medium spiny gabaergic projection neurons. recordings were performed on these neurons, which were
identified (axioskop infrared differential interference contrast video microscopy; zeiss, jena, germany) by their small size and irregular shape
(densely arborizing recurrent axon collaterals). medium spiny neurons
have two electrophysiological states, a down state with resting membrane

kovoor et al. • d2 dopamine receptor and rgs9-2 colocalization

potentials below ⫺80 mv and no spontaneous activity and an up state
with resting membrane potentials above ⫺80 mv and high-frequency
spontaneous action potentials (10 –15 hz) (blackwell et al., 2003). in our
experiments, ⬎90% of the cells were in the down state. however, specific
cell types were not identified using dye injection and immunocytochemistry. thus, we cannot exclude that some recordings were obtained from
other cell types such as gabaergic interneurons. these fast-spiking interneurons are difficult to distinguish morphologically and are also silent
at rest but spike at very high frequencies (up to 200 hz after excitation).
in addition, recordings aimed at these cells are only successful in ⬃1 in 60
cells in striatal slice recordings (centonze et al., 2003). thus, it is likely
that nearly all of our recordings were done in medium spiny projection
neurons. these neurons have been divided into two groups based on
anatomical and biochemical observations and separated into projection
neurons giving rise to a direct pathway (projecting to internal globus
pallidus) or an indirect pathway (projecting to external globus pallidus)
(gerfen, 1992). recent studies have suggested that d2-like dopamine
receptors are present in both groups of medium spiny striatal neurons
(kawaguchi et al., 1990; surmeier et al., 1996; aizman et al., 2000; nicola
et al., 2000). large cholinergic interneurons were excluded by size and
lack of a hyperpolarization-activated cation current (ih).
patch electrodes were pulled (narishige pipette puller, tokyo, japan)
from borosilicate glass and filled with a solution containing the following
(in mm): 144 k gluconate, 3 mgcl2, 10 hepes, 0.2 egta, ph 7.2. the
resistance of the electrodes was between 3 and 9 m⍀. series resistance
was compensated 70 – 85% using lag values of 7– 8 ␮s. recordings were
low-pass filtered at 2 khz and digitized on-line at 20 khz (digidata 1322;
pclamp9 software; axon instruments, union city, ca). all drugs were
dissolved in acsf and applied using an eight-channel application system
(biomedical instruments, zulpich, germany).
antibodies. three anti- xxxg656xxx  antibodies were used: a goat polyclonal
igg directed against the extracellular epitope in the n terminus of  xxxg656xxx ,
a rabbit polyclonal igg also directed against an extracellular epitope
(catalog #sc-7522 and sc-9113, respectively; santa cruz biotechnology,
santa cruz, ca), and another rabbit polyclonal igg from research and
diagnostics (berkeley, ca) (catalog #as-3526s, used in striatal immunohistochemistry). the anti-rgs9 antibody (also used in striatal immunohistochemistry) was a goat antibody from santa cruz biotechnology
(catalog #sc-8142). the anti-m1-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (m1machr) antibody (catalog #amr-001) was a rabbit polyclonal from
alomone labs (jerusalem, israel), and the anti-m2-machr antibody
(catalog #ab5166) was a rat monoclonal igg from chemicon (temecula, ca). all secondary antibodies were from jackson immunoresearch (west grove, pa).
striatal immunohistochemistry. dissected mouse brains were prefixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in pbs, ph 7.4, for 1 h at 4°c. the
fixed brains were then protected in 30% sucrose in pbs for 30 min.
horizontal sections were cut at 20 ␮m. before staining, sections were
postfixed in 1:1 methanol/acetone for 10 min at room temperature and
rehydrated in two changes of pbs (5 min each). sections were blocked
with 1% fish gelatin (sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo) in pbs at room
temperature in a humid box for 1 h. slides were incubated with 1:50
dilution of primary anti- xxxg656xxx  and anti-rgs9-2 in 1% fish gelatin in pbs
at room temperature for 4 h. sections were washed in pbs three times (5
min each wash) and were then incubated with the appropriate secondary
antibody diluted in blocking solution.  xxxg656xxx  was visualized using a
highly cross-absorbed cyanine (cy) 2-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit
antibody, and rgs9-2 was visualized using a highly cross-absorbed cy5conjugated secondary anti-goat antibody (see antibody descriptions
above). sections were washed twice in pbs (10 min each wash) and
mounted on cover slides using 50% glycerol in pbs.
cdna clones and constructs. the cdna for the d1dr, human and the
 xxxg656xxx , human, long and short forms, were provided by m. g. caron
(duke university, durham, nc). the rgs9-2 clone was provided by e. j.
nestler (university of texas southwestern medical center, dallas, tx)
(rahman et al., 1999). the other cdna clones used have been described
previously (kovoor et al., 2000). enhanced green fluorescent protein
(egfp) cdna was from clontech (palo alto, ca). the “depless
rgs9-2” construct was created by deleting from the full-length rgs9-2 a

kovoor et al. • d2 dopamine receptor and rgs9-2 colocalization

segment (residues 2–220) that contained just the dep domain. visualization of full-length rgs9-2 and depless rgs9-2 distribution was facilitated by c-terminal fusion of egfp via a flexible linker sequence:
gsgggsg. the rgs9 dep domain construct consisted solely of the
rgs9 dep domain (residues 30 –110 of rgs9) fused to the n terminus of
egfp via the spacer sequence: gdppvat. all constructs were engineered using standard molecular biology techniques and are shown in
figure 3.
cell transfection and immunostaining. cells (all lines were from american type culture collection, manassas, va) were transfected with
cdna using lipofectamine (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. cells were prepared for transfection
by culturing to ⬃60% confluence in 30 mm poly-l-lysine-coated glassbottom dishes (mattek, ashland, ma). dishes were incubated for 2 h
with 50 ␮g/ml poly-l-lysine (average molecular weight, 25,000; sigmaaldrich) in 15 mm sodium borate buffer, ph 8.4, and were then rinsed
three times with sterile water. twenty-four hours after transfection, the
cells were fixed and stained in the following manner. cells were fixed by
treating with 4% paraformaldehyde (sigma-aldrich) freshly dissolved in
pbs. cells were made permeable by treating with pbs containing 0.2%
triton x-100 (sigma-aldrich) for 4 min. nonspecific antibody binding
sites were masked by incubating in blocking solution consisting of a
solution 1% fish gelatin (sigma-aldrich) and 1% hydrolyzed casein
(sigma-aldrich) in pbs for 30 min. cells were then incubated with the
appropriate primary antibody for 1 h at 37°c followed by incubation
with the corresponding fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody for
another hour at 37°c. antibody dilutions and incubations were performed in blocking solution. cells were washed four times with pbs (5
min each wash) before and after every one of the above treatments.
finally, the cells were mounted by overlaying with 50%  xxxd2216xxx 
in pbs and stored at ⫺20°c.
specificity of antibodies and fluorescent signals. control experiments to
confirm specificity and validity of fluorescent signals were as follows.
primary antibody specificity was evaluated by comparing immunostaining in cells that were transfected with cdna for the target protein with
sham-transfected cells. no signal was observed in sham-transfected cells
for any of the primary antibodies used. the specificity of the primary
antibody signal was further confirmed by ensuring that transfected cells
were not stained using normal serum from the species used to raise the
antibody. specificity of the rgs9-2 antibody was further validated by
determining absence of immunostaining in striatum from rgs9 knockout mice. cells were also stained directly with the fluorophoreconjugated secondary antibody in the absence of the primary antibody.
insignificant fluorescent signal was noted in all of these control experiments. thus, all the secondary antibodies used reacted only with the
appropriate primary antibody and not with cellular antigens. images of
the control tissue were collected with the same settings used for the
labeled tissue.
confocal microscopy. all images were obtained using a leica tcs laser
scanning spectral inverted confocal microscope (leica microsystems,
bannockburn, il) with a 40⫻ oil immersion objective (for striatal immunohistochemistry) or a 100⫻ oil immersion objective (all other images). egfp and cy2 were excited with the 488 nm line from an argon
laser, cy3 was excited with the 568 nm line from a krypton laser, and cy2
was excited using the 633 nm line from a helium–neon laser. emitted
fluorescence was spectrally dispersed using a prism, and the spectral
window for data collection by the photomultiplier tube was defined using adjustable slits. egfp and cy2 signals were collected using a spectral
window that extended from 495 to 510 nm. cy3 signals were collected
using a spectral window that extended from 585 to 600 nm. cy5 signals
were collected using a spectral window that extended from 665 to 675
nm. the pinhole was set at ⬃1 airy unit. images were collected at a
resolution of 1024 ⫻ 1024 pixels using the slowest scan-speed setting for
the microscope. only one of the fluorophores was excited (by activation
of just the one corresponding laser line) during each image acquisition
scan, and so the dual images from double-labeled cells were obtained
sequentially instead of simultaneously. using these conditions, we were
able to ensure that there was no “bleed-through” of signal from one
fluorophore into the collection window of the other in double-labeling

j. neurosci., february 23, 2005 • 25(8):2157–2165 • 2159

experiments. absence of bleed-through was confirmed by sequentially
imaging cells labeled with only one of the pair of fluorophores. in these
control experiments, no bleed-through was observed even as the laser
power was increased 500% over that used to collect the images in the
coexpression experiments.
oocyte culture and crna preparation and injection. xenopus oocyte
preparation was described previously (kovoor et al., 2000). crna was
synthesized in vitro from plasmids containing the cdna and appropriate
promoters for crna transcription. plasmids were linearized before
crna synthesis, and mmessage machine kits (ambion, austin, tx) were
used to generate capped crna. crna was injected into oocytes at a
volume of 25 nl per oocyte using a drummond microinjector. oocytes
were maintained in a saline buffer (containing, in mm: 96 nacl, 2 kcl, 1
mgcl2, 1 cacl2, and 5 hepes, ph 7.5) solution supplemented with
sodium pyruvate (2.5 mm) (sigma-aldrich) and  xxxd2193xxx  (50 ␮g/ml)
(sigma-aldrich).
oocyte electrophysiology. two-electrode voltage-clamp experiments
were performed 36 –72 h after crna injection. membrane potential was
clamped at ⫺80 mv using a geneclamp 500 amplifier and pclamp 6
software (axon instruments). a valve system controlled by the data acquisition software, pclamp 6, was used to control solution changes and
to minimize wash-in and wash-out times. electrodes were filled with 3 m
kcl and had resistances of 0.5–1.5 m⍀. to reveal currents through the
inwardly rectifying g-protein-gated inward rectifier potassium (girk)
channels, recordings were performed in oocyte saline buffer with elevated (16 mm) kcl concentration (other components, in mm: 82 nacl, 1
mgcl2, 1 cacl2, and 5 hepes, ph 7.5). kinetic analysis and curve fitting
were performed using pclamp 6 software. exponentials were fit to the
activation and deactivation phases of the girk currents. cursors were
positioned at points on the activation and deactivation curves that corresponded to 20 and 80% of the maximum equilibrium responses, and
the exponentials were fitted to the portions of the current trace between
these two points.

results
rgs9-2 attenuates motor behavior related to
upregulated  xxxg656xxx 
we treated rgs9 knock-out mice and wild-type mice with reserpine, which depletes dopamine from nerve terminals, or with the
antipsychotic haloperidol, a specific antagonist of d2-like drs
(see materials and methods). both reserpine and haloperidol
treatments can selectively produce supersensitivity of striatal d2like drs (lahoste and marshall, 1994). we observed no obvious
behavioral differences between drug-naive rgs9 knock-out animals and wild-type littermates. reserpine treatment for 3 d (see
materials and methods) produced a comparable loss of spontaneous locomotion in both groups (data not shown). however,
after reserpine or haloperidol treatment, dopaminergic agonists
(quinpirole, selective agonist of d2-like drs or apomorphine,
nonselective agonist of d1- and d2-like drs) produced severe
aims (fig. 1 a, c) (see also http://orphanin.caltech.edu/⬃lester/
world/videos%20for%20rgs9%20jns%20paper/ for video
clips) only in the rgs9-deficient mice (aim score, ⬎4; see materials and methods). gait alterations included excessive sideward and backward motions. these animals also had difficulties
maintaining an upright posture and repeatedly hit the cage wall.
there were frequent rapid jerky movements, predominantly of
hindlimbs. most animals also showed an excessively bent trunk
resembling dystonia. apomorphine and quinpirole also produced a greater increase in locomotion after reserpine in the
rgs9 knock-out mice (fig. 1 b). the genetic ablation of rgs9
did not affect d1 dopamine receptor-related behavior: the d1dr
agonist skf 38393, after reserpine or haloperidol, elicited comparable mild orofacial aims and locomotion in both wild-type
and knock-out animals (fig. 1 a–c). these data suggest that the

observed aims result from the perturbation of a d2-like dr-specific cellular
pathway.
administration of dopaminergic agonists before reserpine or haloperidol treatment produced few aims (mean aim, ⬍1
in both groups) in either wild-type or
rgs9-null animals. in accordance with
previous reports (lahoste and marshall,
1994; lahoste et al., 2000), relevant aims
were not observed in either set of mice pretreated with vehicle injections for 3 d and
subsequently challenged with quinpirole
(10 mg/kg).
the relatively short duration of reserpine or haloperidol treatment (3 d) may
explain why significant increases in locomotion after reserpine or after haloperidol
only occurred in response to apomorphine
and only in rgs9 knock-out mice.
previously, double-labeling in situ hybridization experiments suggested that
rgs9-2 transcripts are expressed in those
striatal neurons that might also express
 xxxg656xxx  (rahman et al., 2003). immunostains of striatal sections confirmed that
there was a significant degree of overlap of
 xxxg656xxx  and rgs9-2 protein expression in
the striatum (fig. 1 d).

a role for rgs9-2 in cellular signaling of
d2-like dr in vivo and implications for
synaptic modulation
previously, we helped to show that  xxxg656xxx 
activation produced a significantly greater
inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in striatal extracts from rgs9 knock-out animals compared with their wild-type littermate controls (rahman
et al., 2003). the striatal medium spiny neurons that express
d2-class dopamine receptors and rgs9-2 receive excitatory glutamatergic inputs from the cortex in addition to the dopaminergic inputs from the substantia nigra (gerfen, 1992). therefore,
we investigated whether the activation of d2-like drs could
modulate glutamate-elicited conductances in these cells. application of glutamate (100 ␮m) to voltage-clamped medium spiny
neurons in slice preparations from either wild-type or rgs9-null
mice activated robust inward currents (fig. 2 a, b). these currents desensitized partially during a 6 s glutamate application
(fig. 2 a, b). the desensitization was transient, and the response
recovered after ⬎3 min of glutamate-free wash. coapplication
of 1–100 ␮m quinpirole, a selective agonist of d2-like drs, significantly inhibited the peak amplitude of the glutamate-elicited
response in rgs9 null neurons, whereas there was no significant
reduction by quinpirole in wild-type cells (fig. 2 a, b). although
quinpirole concentrations ⬎10 ␮m may affect targets in addition
to  xxxg656xxx , it is notable that statistically significant inhibition of
glutamate-elicited currents in the knock-out animals were observed both at 1 and 10 ␮m quinpirole (fig. 2 b). the fraction of
rgs9-null cells that showed ⬎25% inhibition of glutamate (100
␮m)-induced currents was 0.5 at 1 ␮m and increased to 0.67  xxxd1891xxx 
␮m and 1.0 at 100 ␮m. in contrast, the fraction of wild-type cells
in which the glutamate-elicited currents were inhibited ⬎25%
was 0.22 (1 and 10 ␮m quinpirole) or 0.44 (100 ␮m quinpirole).

application of quinpirole alone produced no changes in membrane conductance of either wild-type or rgs9-null neurons. we
used 100 ␮m quinpirole to study effects on nmda- or ampainduced currents because we detected the most striking differences between genotypes at this concentration. nmda receptors
accounted for the component of glutamate-evoked currents
modulated by quinpirole in the rgs9-null cells, because 100 ␮m
quinpirole significantly inhibited nmda-elicited (100 ␮m) but
not ampa-elicited (10 ␮m) currents (fig. 2c). finally, the inhibitory effects of quinpirole were blocked by the specific d2-like dr
antagonist sulpiride, confirming that they were mediated via d2like drs.
the abnormal inhibition of glutamate-elicited currents by d2like drs in the absence of rgs9 was not a result of increased
expression of glutamate receptors, because the amplitude of the
glutamate response was not increased in rgs9-null neurons (fig.
2). these data suggest that in wild-type neurons, rgs9-2 blocks
d2-like dr-mediated modulation of conductances elicited by activation of nmda receptors. because it seemed unlikely that this
effect arises solely from the gtpase-enhancing activity of
rgs9-2, we explored other functional associations between
rgs9-2 and d2drs, the most abundantly expressed d2-like drs.

able using the detergent triton x-100 (see materials and methods). using this same protocol, identical staining patterns were
obtained using three separate antibodies that were directed
against different intracellular and extracellular epitopes within
 xxxg656xxx . no  xxxg656xxx  immunostain was observed in dishes not transfected with  xxxg656xxx  cdna.
to observe rgs9 distribution, we used an rgs9-2 fusion construct, rgs9-2–egfp, in which the egfp was attached to the c
terminus of the full-length striatally expressed rgs9 isoform,
rgs9-2 (fig. 3) (see materials and methods).
the  xxxg656xxx  expression pattern in cho cells (fig. 4 a) was
consistent with previous studies showing that ⱖ80% of the  xxxg656xxx 
expressed in several cell types, including human embryonic kidney (hek) 293t, cos-7, and hela, resides within intracellular
compartments (prou et al., 2001). it was also consistent with our
observations in striatal neurons in which  xxxg656xxx  is in extranuclear
accumulations (compare figs. 1 d, 4 a). in cho cells transfected
solely with the rgs9-2 cdna, the rgs9-2 protein was distributed uniformly throughout the cytoplasm (fig. 4 b). however,
when cho cells were transfected with cdna for both  xxxg656xxx  and
the rgs9-2, we found that the expression pattern of rgs9-2 was
dramatically altered and was now identical to the patchy distribution pattern seen for  xxxg656xxx  (fig. 4c).

targeting of dep domains to  xxxg656xxx 
to identify the molecular domains required for targeting rgs9-2
to  xxxg656xxx , we created two constructs, depless rgs9-2 and the
rgs9 dep domain (fig. 3) (see materials and methods). when
expressed alone, both protein constructs were distributed uniformly throughout the cytoplasm (fig. 4 f, h ). coexpression
with  xxxg656xxx  altered the distribution: the rgs9 dep domain was
targeted to the distinctive, cytoplasmic compartments expressing
 xxxg656xxx , whereas the distribution pattern of depless rgs9-2 was
unaffected (fig. 4g,i, respectively), suggesting that the dep domain is both necessary and sufficient for targeting rgs9-2 to
 xxxg656xxx . the patterns shown here for cho cells were reproduced
in experiments with hek 293t and nih3t3 cell lines (data not
shown).
all results shown are with the d2short (d2s) dr, but identical
results were obtained with d2long dr, which contains 29 additional amino acids in the third cytoplasmic loop (missale et al.,
1998), suggesting that this loop plays no important role in the
association with dep domains. likewise, a mutant d2sdr lacking the cytoplasmic-tail (1) had wild-type like subcellular distribution and (2) was able to colocalize the rgs9 dep domain (data
not shown).
dep domains target to plasma membrane-localized  xxxg656xxx 
in most of the cell lines tested, the fluorescence of the large pool of
intracellular  xxxg656xxx  overwhelmed any signal from plasma
membrane-associated molecules. do rgs9-2 and  xxxg656xxx  associate at the plasma membrane, where rgs9-2 presumably functions? we transfected undifferentiated rat pheochromocytoma
12 (pc12) cells with  xxxg656xxx  cdna using a lipid-mediated transfection protocol. under these conditions, we found that  xxxg656xxx 
was expressed primarily in the plasma membrane (fig. 4 j) when
these cells were examined 24 –36 h after transfection. rgs9-2 and
depless rgs9-2, when expressed alone in these cells, appeared
uniformly through the cytosol (fig. 4 k, m ). coexpression of
 xxxg656xxx  with full-length rgs9-2, but not with depless rgs9-2,
resulted in an enriched rgs9-2 signal at the plasma membrane
(compare figs. 4 l, green panel; 3 k, m,n, green panels).

we tested the effect of  xxxg656xxx  agonists
on the colocalization of  xxxg656xxx  and dep
domain-containing constructs. cells were
incubated with dopamine (1 ␮m), apomorphine (1 ␮m), or quinpirole (1 ␮m) for
periods ranging from 5 min to 24 h. these
 xxxg656xxx  agonists did not affect the cellular
distribution of  xxxg656xxx  or the association
between  xxxg656xxx  and dep domains in pc12
cells or cho cells (data not shown).
functional effects of
 xxxg656xxx –rgs9-2 colocalization
rgs9-2 did not colocalize detectably to
any other gpcrs that were screened.
these included (1) the gq-coupled m1machr, the cellular expression pattern of
which matches that of  xxxg656xxx  (fig. 5 a, b),
(2) the gs-coupled d1 dopamine receptor
(fig. 5c,d), and (3) the gi- and gocoupled m2-machr (fig. 5 e, f ).
we used the xenopus oocyte system to

specific dep domain-dependent localization of rgs9-2 to  xxxg656xxx . it is appropriate
to assay for the gtpase-enhancing property of rgs proteins by measuring the accelerated deactivation of coexpressed

dep domain gpcr interactions
are specific
the observations that the egfp tag was
not colocalized to  xxxg656xxx  and that its distribution was not altered by coexpressed
 xxxg656xxx  argue for a specific interaction between  xxxg656xxx  and egfp-tagged rgs9-2
(fig. 4 d, e). in addition, an rgs9-2 construct lacking the dep domain did not colocalize with  xxxg656xxx . in fact, the rgs9 dep
domain is both necessary and sufficient for
targeting rgs9-2 to the cellular regions
expressing  xxxg656xxx  (fig. 4 f–i ). also,
rgs9-2 (fig. 5) and the rgs9 dep domain (data not shown) did not colocalize
with m1-machr (fig. 5 a, b), which had
an expression pattern comparable with
that of  xxxg656xxx  in cho cells or with d1dr
(fig. 5c,d). thus, overexpression of a
gpcr did not guarantee association. finally, a construct containing a mutated
dep domain (f115s; data not shown)
failed to relocalize to coexpressed  xxxg656xxx .
these data point to a specific targeting
of rgs9-2 to  xxxg656xxx  and exclude coincidental colocalization, because the distribution of full-length rgs9-2 and the dep
domain was altered by  xxxg656xxx  coexpression. after  xxxg656xxx  coexpression, dep
domain-containing constructs were relocated to the compartment expressing
 xxxg656xxx  (i.e., to the plasma membrane in
pc12 cells and to the  xxxg656xxx -expressing cytoplasmic compartments in other cell
types). if the interaction between rgs9-2
and  xxxg656xxx  occurs via a third protein, this
additional protein is expressed in all cell
types that were examined.
gpcr, rgs proteins, and
signal specificity
this study suggests how rgs regulation
can be targeted to a specific g-proteincoupled receptor pathway. the agonistindependent, dep domain-dependent colocalization positions rgs9-2 close to the
 xxxg656xxx -coupled g␣ subunits. after g␣
subunits are released by activated d2drs,
the proximity of rgs9-2 to  xxxg656xxx  allows
rgs9-2 to readily interact with and inactivate these nearby g-protein subunits.
the functional effects of such colocalization become even more prominent in neurons, which have a more complex morphology than xenopus oocytes and have

2164 • j. neurosci., february 23, 2005 • 25(8):2157–2165

specialized regions such as axon terminals, initial segments, and
dendrites. our model provides a molecular explanation for two
recently published studies. in one study, viral-mediated overexpression of rgs9-2, but not rgs4, in rat ventral striatum, reduced locomotor responses specifically to  xxxg656xxx  agonists (rahman et al., 2003). in another study, rgs9 reduced  xxxg656xxx 
modulation of  xxxg303xxx  channels but did not alter m2-muscarinic
receptor modulation of  xxxg303xxx  currents in the same neuron
(cabrera-vera et al., 2004).
implications for synaptic modulation by d2drs
our use of girk channels in the xenopus oocyte experiments
(fig. 5) does not suggest that they are effector molecules for
d2drs in the striatum. in fact, the effector molecules important
in striatal d2-like dr signaling pathways have not been identified
(nicola et al., 2000). however, d2-like drs in the striatum signal
via heterotrimeric g-proteins and girk channels are activated
by these same g-proteins (dascal, 2001). previously, we have
shown that the activation of coexpressed girk channels is a sensitive measure of the physiologically relevant activation of
g-proteins and of rgs function (kovoor et al., 2000). similarly,
in this study, these channels were used to show that the dep
domain-mediated localization of rgs9 to d2drs can have functional consequences for g-protein-mediated  xxxg656xxx  signaling.
both excitatory glutamatergic inputs from the cortex and dopaminergic inputs from the substantia nigra make synaptic contacts with the medium spiny neuron (gerfen, 1992), which express  xxxg981xxx  subunits and dopamine receptors. our
data clearly demonstrate that rgs9 is an important regulator of
the neuronal pathways that modulate the membrane conductances elicited by nmda-type  xxxg981xxx  activation.
this modulation may be important in drug-induced dyskinesia,
because recent study in primates indicates that levodopa-induced
dyskinesias can be modulated via nmda and ampa receptors.
antagonists of ampa receptors reduce d1dr agonist-induced
dyskinesias, and antagonists of nmda receptors reduce  xxxg656xxx 
agonist-induced dyskinesia (bibbiani et al., 2004). in addition,
hemiparkinsonian rats chronically treated with levodopa also
show abnormal phosphorylation of nmda receptors (dunah et
al., 2000). the present experiments also provide the first physiologically relevant description of a cellular function for an rgs
protein in the brain.
because voltage-clamp recordings in neurons can be limited
by inadequate space clamp, it is possible that glutamate application strongly depolarized regions of the neurons, locally activating voltage-dependent channels. conceivably then, it is not the
nmda receptors but these secondary conductances that are inhibited by quinpirole in striatal slices from the rgs9 knock-out
animals, and nmda and ampa receptors are differentially localized to the extent that they activate distinct secondary conductance. thus, although our data indicate that the striatal signal
transduction pathways modulated by rgs9-2 are closely associated with nmda but not ampa receptors, a direct interaction
between the dopaminergic and glutamatergic receptors cannot
yet be claimed.
pharmacological tests do not distinguish conclusively between the d2drs and the other d2-class drs (d3 and d4). druginduced dyskinesias are elicited by agonists and antagonists acting on all members of the d2 class of dopamine receptors, and the
contributions of d2 versus d3 versus d4 receptors for the pathogenesis of this condition is not clear. therefore, discrimination of
the effect of lack of rgs9 on modulation of signaling via individ-

kovoor et al. • d2 dopamine receptor and rgs9-2 colocalization

ual members of the d2-class receptors was not within the scope of
the present study.
d2-like drs are thought to be expressed by a subset (⬃50 –
60%) of striatal medium spiny neurons (gerfen, 1992; surmeier
et al., 1996). in accordance with this idea, the fraction of rgs9null striatal neurons that showed ⬎25% inhibition of glutamateelicited currents was 0.5 at 1 ␮m quinpirole, a concentration of
quinpirole that is specific for d2-like drs. all of the rgs9-null
cells responded to 100 ␮m quinpirole, possibly because of nonspecific effects at this quinpirole concentration. alternatively, the
absence of rgs9 might allow for the functional detection of low
levels of d2-class receptors that are ordinarily not detected. this
suggestion is supported by a recent study by aizman and colleagues, which found that virtually all striatal neurons, both in
vitro and in vivo, contained dopamine receptors of both classes
(aizman et al., 2000).
the relationship between the abnormal electrophysiology in
the striatal neurons from the rgs9 knock-out mice and the abnormal behavior detected after dopamine depletion or neuroleptic treatment remains to be elucidated. unfortunately, electrophysiological recordings in mutant mice were successful only in
animals younger than 4 weeks. thus, all electrophysiological data
were taken in animals that were not weaned and hence were too
young to reproduce the behavioral abnormalities that we detected in older animals. however, these data are a first step toward understanding the cellular mechanisms for the locomotor
abnormalities observed in the older rgs9-null mice.
a model for dyskinesias?
there are few animal models for drug-induced dyskinesias
(kulkarni and naidu, 2001), and the abnormal involuntary
movements described in this study (fig. 1) more closely resemble
drug-induced dyskinesia in humans than other reported rodent
models such as vacuous chewing (andreassen et al., 2001).
direct treatment of the knock-out mice with  xxxg656xxx  agonists
only produced minor increases in locomotion. disorders similar
to the drug-induced dyskinesias were produced exclusively in
rgs9 knock-out mice and only when  xxxg656xxx  agonist treatment
was preceded by a prolonged inhibition of dopaminergic transmission (see materials and methods). there is evidence that
chronic inhibition of dopamine signaling along the nigrostriatal
dopamine pathway can produce  xxxg656xxx  supersensitivity (i.e., enhanced cellular signaling) that may result from an increase in the
number of striatal  xxxg656xxx  (rubinstein et al., 1990; lahoste and
marshall, 1994).
rgs9-2 could suppress these abnormal movements via either
of two mechanisms. by accelerating the termination of g-protein
signals, rgs proteins attenuate the integrated cellular effects of
g-protein activation (ross and wilkie, 2000). rgs9-2 and  xxxg656xxx 
are found coexpressed in striatal medium spiny neurons (rahman et al., 2003), and rgs9-2 can accelerate the termination of
 xxxg656xxx  signals (fig. 5 e, f ). because rgs9-2 is targeted to  xxxg656xxx 
via the rgs9-2 dep domain, it is well situated to influence any
functional effects of altered  xxxg656xxx  expression that may result
from prolonged antipsychotic treatment (rubinstein et al., 1990;
lahoste and marshall, 1994). thus, drugs targeting rgs9-2
might be useful in the treatment of dyskinesias (neubig and siderovski, 2002).
alternatively, the rgs9 dep domain in conjunction with
other proteins may compartmentalize d2-like drs so as to prevent d2-like dr-mediated inhibition of nmda-elicited conductances. prolonged inhibition of dopaminergic signaling could alter expression levels of either  xxxg656xxx  or rgs9-2 so as to disrupt

kovoor et al. • d2 dopamine receptor and rgs9-2 colocalization

such compartmentalization, leading to an abnormal signaling
and abnormal involuntary movements.
in our rgs9 knock-out mouse model, we elicited abnormal
movements after only 3 d of drug treatment. dyskinesias in human patients occur only after months, if not years, of therapy and
may reflect the time required for significant alterations in striatal
 xxxg656xxx  or rgs9-2. the speedier onset of abnormal movements in
the rgs9 knock-out mice may result from the complete loss of
rgs9-2 expression resulting from the genetic ablation of rgs9. if
dysregulation of rgs9 contributes to drug-induced dyskinesia in
humans, alterations are presumably more subtle and require time
to develop.
