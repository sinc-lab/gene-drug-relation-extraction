and activation of k þ channels.
2 kmup-1 (0.01–100 mm) induced concentration-dependent relaxation responses in guinea-pig
epithelium-intact trachea precontracted with carbachol. relaxation responses were also elicited by the
pde inhibitors theophylline,  xxxd2388xxx  ( xxxd2388xxx ), milrinone,  xxxd3142xxx  and zaprinast
(100 mm), and a  xxxg1253xxx  opener, levcromakalim.
3 tracheal relaxation induced by kmup-1 was attenuated by epithelium removal and by
pretreatment with inhibitors of soluble  xxxg1587xxx  (sgc) (1h-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (odq), 1 mm),  xxxd2738xxx  synthase (no-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, 100 mm), k þ
channels (tetraethylammonium, 10 mm), katp channels ( xxxd2215xxx , 1 mm), voltage-dependent k þ
channels ( xxxd1804xxx , 100 mm) and ca2 þ -dependent k þ channels (charybdotoxin, 0.1 mm or
apamin, 1 mm).
4 both kmup-1 (10 mm) and theophylline nonselectively and slightly inhibited the enzyme activity
of  xxxg1695xxx , 4 and 5, suggesting that they are able to inhibit the metabolism of adenosine 30 ,50 -cyclic
monophosphate ( xxxd1773xxx ) and guanosine 30 ,50 -cyclic monophosphate ( xxxd1274xxx ). likewise, the
effects of  xxxd2388xxx  were also measured and its ic50 values for  xxxg1695xxx , 4 and 5 were 6.571.2, 26.373.9
and 31.775.3 mm, respectively.
5 kmup-1 (0.01–10 mm) augmented intracellular  xxxd1773xxx  and  xxxd1274xxx  levels in guinea-pig
cultured tracheal smooth muscle cells. these increases in  xxxd1773xxx  and  xxxd1274xxx  were abolished
in the presence of an adenylate cyclase inhibitor sq 22536 (100 mm) and an sgc inhibitor odq
(10 mm), respectively.
6 kmup-1 (10 mm) increased the expression of  xxxg1836xxx  (pkari) and protein kinase g
(pkg1a1b) in a time-dependent manner, but this was only significant for pkg after 9 h.
7 intratracheal administration of  xxxg2296xxx -a ( xxxg2296xxx , 0.01 mg kg1) induced
bronchoconstriction and exhibited a time-dependent increase in lung resistance (rl) and decrease in
dynamic lung compliance (cdyn). kmup-1 (1.0 mg kg1), injected intravenously for 10 min before the
intratracheal  xxxg2296xxx , reversed these changes in rl and cdyn.
8 these data indicate that kmup-1 activates sgc, produces relaxation that was partly dependent
on an intact epithelium, inhibits pdes and increases intracellular  xxxd1773xxx  and  xxxd1274xxx , which
then increases pka and pkg, leading to the opening of k þ channels and resulting tracheal
relaxation.

introduction
cyclic nucleotides are major intracellular signalling molecules
that play a crucial role in the function of mammalian cells.

1106

b.-n. wu et al

intracellular concentrations of cyclic nucleotides are regulated
by two families of enzymes, adenylate and guanylate cyclases
which synthesize adenosine 30 ,50 -cyclic monophosphate (cyclic
amp) and guanosine 30 ,50 -cyclic monophosphate (cyclic
gmp) from their corresponding nucleotide triphosphates,
and  xxxg1696xxx  which catalyze the
hydrolysis and inactivation of  xxxd1773xxx  and/or  xxxd1274xxx .
the elevation of  xxxd1773xxx  in airway tissues has important
implications for cellular responses in an allergic reaction.
b2-adrenoceptor agonists, widely used as bronchodilators in
the treatment of asthma, relax airway smooth muscle through
a  xxxd1773xxx -dependent mechanism. it is well documented
that  xxxd1274xxx , like  xxxd1773xxx , is an important second
messenger in the regulation of airway tone. several nitrogencontaining compounds, such as sodium nitroprusside, and
exogenous and endogenous  xxxd2738xxx  (no) activate
soluble  xxxg1587xxx  (sgc), elevate  xxxd1274xxx  and relax
airway smooth muscle in vitro (murad et al., 1978; gruetter
et al., 1989). the relaxations induced by nitrovasodilators
in canine and guinea-pig trachea correlate well with the
elevation in  xxxd1274xxx , suggesting that  xxxd1274xxx  mediates
the relaxation (zhou & torphy, 1991). inhibition of cyclic
gmp-specific phosphodiesterase (pde) by xanthine derivatives leads to the relaxation of canine and guinea-pig trachea
(polson et al., 1985; tanaka et al., 1991). type 5 pde
inhibitors such as sildenafil and zaprinast can elevate cyclic
gmp activity, and they have been shown to induce relaxation in guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle (bernareggi et al.,
1999). moreover, yc-1, an no-independent sgc activator,
with nonspecific pde inhibitory activity, also induces
 xxxd1274xxx -mediated relaxation in guinea-pig trachea (hwang
et al., 1999).
the airway epithelium is a physical barrier that protects
sensory nerves and smooth muscle from stimulation by inhaled
irritants and participates in the regulation of bronchial
reactivity. it has been reported that epithelial cells release
various smooth muscle inhibitory mediators, such as no and
 xxxd1903xxx , as well as the so-called epithelium-derived
relaxing factor (epdrf) detected by the coaxial bioassay
system (nijkamp et al., 1993; folkerts & nijkamp, 1998).
no donors have been shown to activate katp channels via a
 xxxd1274xxx -dependent mechanism, presumably involving
activation of  xxxd1274xxx -dependent protein kinase, in rat
tracheal smooth muscle cells (kubo et al., 1993) and rabbit
mesenteric artery (murphy & brayden, 1995), and by a cyclic
gmp-independent mechanism in the rat mesenteric artery
(weidelt et al., 1997). in guinea-pig isolated trachea, cromakalim, a  xxxg1253xxx  opener, causes concentration-dependent
suppression of spontaneous muscle tone (arch et al., 1988) and
these results were subsequently confirmed by using single
tracheal smooth muscle cells under voltage-clamp conditions
(matsushita et al., 2000). this effect is associated with
membrane hyperpolarization close to the k þ equilibrium
potential. k þ channel-blocking agents, such as tetraethylammonium (tea), inhibit cromakalim-induced hyperpolarization and relaxation (allen et al., 1986). it has been reported
that the dose of k þ channel openers effective at reducing
airway resistance in vivo is lower than that required for the
relaxation of airways in vitro (mccaig & de jonckheere,
1989). a tentative explanation for this phenomenon is that the
reactivity of sensory neurones in airway epithelium is reduced
by low concentrations of k þ channel openers via activation of

katp channels, which results in hyperpolarization of the
neurone.
7-[2-[4-(2-chlorophenyl)piperazinyl]ethyl]-1,3- xxxd3344xxx  (kmup-1), figure 1, a chemically synthetic
xanthine-based derivative, has been demonstrated to inhibit
pde and increase  xxxd1274xxx  in rat aortic smooth muscle
(wu et al., 2001). further, we have shown that kmup-1
relaxes the rabbit corpus cavernosum smooth muscle and that
stimulation of  xxxd1274xxx  and opening of k þ channels is
involved in this response (lin et al., 2002). these observations
indicate that the relaxing activity of kmup-1 in trachea might
also be attributed to accumulation of cyclic nucleotides and the
resulting opening of k þ channels. it is generally accepted that
inhibition of type 4 pde by xanthine derivatives, including
methylxanthine, increases intracellular formation of cyclic
amp in various smooth muscle cells. theophylline has been
shown to exert nonspecific inhibition of pde and to increase
 xxxd1773xxx , leading to long-term relaxation in smooth muscles
(beavo, 1995).
the purpose of this study was to elucidate the mechanism by
which kmup-1 activates the  xxxd1773xxx /gmp-dependent
protein kinase pathway, and thus the opening of k þ channels
and resulting relaxation of guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle.

methods
animals
male dunkin hartley guinea-pigs (300–400 g) were provided
from the national laboratory animal breeding and research
center (taipei, taiwan). they were housed under conditions
of constant temperature and controlled illumination. food
and water were available ad libitum. the study was approved
by the animal care and use committee of kaohsiung
medical university.

isolated tracheal preparation and measurement of tension
guinea-pigs were killed after being anaesthetized with ether
and their tracheas were quickly excised. tracheas were

b.-n. wu et al

dissected free of adhering fat and connective tissue, and
cut into spiral strips as previously described in this laboratory (wu et al., 1994). these spiral strips were then
mounted in organ baths filled with 20 ml of krebs solution
of the following composition (mm): nacl 118, kcl 4.8,
cacl2 2.5,  xxxd2534xxx  1.2, kh2po4 1.2, nahco3 24 and glucose
11. the solution was maintained at 371c and aerated with
95% o2 plus 5% co2. to achieve a steady spontaneous
tone level, an initial tension of 2 g was applied for 1 h.
all experiments were carried out in the presence of indomethacin (3 mm) and propranolol (1 mm) to prevent the
formation of prostanoids and to inhibit b-adrenoceptormediated responses, respectively. contractions were measured
isometrically with a force–displacement transducer (model
ft03, grass, quincy, ma, u.s.a.) and recorded on a highspeed videograph (model l1969, coulbourn, lehigh valley,
pa, u.s.a.).
in some experiments, the epithelial cells were removed
mechanically by rubbing the internal surface of trachea with a
fine silver wire (200 mm diameter) as previously described for
removal of endothelial cells in vascular tissues (bolton et al.,
1984). the removal of the epithelial layer was confirmed by
histological examination. briefly, segments of trachea were
fixed at in situ length in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin and
embedded with paraplast-plus paraffin. sections (5 mm) were
stained with a routine harris h & e procedure. isolated
tracheal strips were contracted with carbachol (10 mm) and,
once the contractions had reached a plateau, various
concentrations of kmup-1 (0.01–100 mm) were added. all
relaxations are expressed as a percentage of carbachol-induced
maximal contractile responses.
to examine the possible mechanisms of tracheal relaxant
effects of kmup-1, the tracheal strips were pretreated with a
sgc inhibitor odq (1 mm), a nos inhibitor no-nitro-larginine methyl ester (l-name; 100 mm), a k þ channel
blocker tea (10 mm), a  xxxg1253xxx  blocker  xxxd2215xxx 
(1 mm), a voltage-dependent k þ channel blocker  xxxd1804xxx 
(100 mm) and ca2 þ -dependent k þ channel blockers apamin
(1 mm) and chtx (0.1 mm) for 30 min prior to the addition of
kmup-1.

phosphodiesterase assay
pde activity was determined by the method of hidaka &
asano (1976). washed human platelets were used for both
 xxxg1695xxx  and 5 analyses and human u937 cells for pde4.
purified protein containing  xxxg1695xxx , 4 or 5 enzyme was
resuspended in 50 mm tris–hcl containing 5 mm mgcl2 (ph
7.5). subsequently, the enzyme (11.5 mg ml1, 10 ml) was
incubated with tris–hcl (80 ml) and 10 mm  xxxd1274xxx  or
 xxxd1773xxx  substrate (final concentration 1 mm containing
0.1 mci [3h]- xxxd1274xxx  or [3h]- xxxd1773xxx ) was added. after
20 min at 371c, the samples were heated to 1001c for 2 min.
ophiophagus hannah snake venom (10 mg ml1, 10 ml) was then
added and incubated at 371c for 10 min to convert the 50 -gmp
and 50 -amp to the uncharged nucleosides, guanosine and
adenosine, respectively. an ion-exchange resin (200 ml) was
added to bind all unconverted  xxxd1274xxx  or  xxxd1773xxx .
after centrifugation, the supernatant was removed for
determination of radiolabelled guanosine or adenosine by a
liquid scintillation counter.

culture of guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle cells
guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle (tsm) strips were
obtained as sterile surgical specimens under dissection microscopy. the tissue was washed and cut into 1–2 mm pieces and
placed into culture dishes with dulbecco’s modified eagle’s
medium (dmem) containing 20% foetal bovine serum,
100 units ml1  xxxd2871xxx , 100 mg ml1 streptomycin and
2 mm glutamine. after these explants attached to the culture
dish, in usually 1–2 days, dmem supplement with 10% fbs,
penicillin, streptomycin and glutamine was added. tracheal
smooth muscle cells (tsmcs) migrated out from the explants
in 3–5 days. at this time, the explants were removed, and cells
were allowed to achieve confluence. cells were detached using
0.05% trypsin and 0.02% edta at 371c for 5 min to establish
secondary cultures. cultures were maintained for no more
than four passages. to exclude contamination by epithelial
cells and fibroblasts, the cell homogeneity was further
confirmed by the presence of smooth muscle-specific a-actin
and a-myosin. indirect immunofluorescence staining for a
variety of antigens was carried out by first plating the cells on
chamber slides, fixing the cells in 3.7% formaldehydephosphate buffered saline for 10 min and then permeabilizing
the cells with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% triton x-100.
cells were stained with a mouse monoclonal antibody directed
against the amino-terminal 10 amino acids of a-smooth muscle
actin and a-myosin (boehringer mannheim, indianapolis, in,
u.s.a.). all were stained with fluorescein-labelled goat antimouse igg antibody. over 95% of the cell preparation was
found to be composed of smooth muscle cells.

measurement of  xxxd1773xxx  and  xxxd1274xxx 
intracellular  xxxd1274xxx  and  xxxd1773xxx  concentrations in
guinea-pig tsmcs were assayed as previously described (wu
et al., 2001). in brief, cells were grown in 24-well plates 105 cells
per well. at confluence, monolayer cells were washed with
phosphate buffer solution (pbs) and then incubated with
kmup-1 (0.1–100 mm) in the presence of 100 mm  xxxd2388xxx  for
20 min. incubation was terminated by the addition of 10%
trichloroacetic acid (tca). cell suspensions were sonicated
and then centrifuged at 2500  g for 15 min at 41c. to remove
tca, the supernatants were extracted three times with 5
volumes of water-saturated  xxxd2052xxx . then, the supernatants were lyophilized and the  xxxd1274xxx  or amp of
each sample was determined by using commercially available
radioimmunoassay kits (amersham pharmacia biotech, buckinghamshire, england).

western blot analysis of  xxxg1836xxx  and protein
kinase g
the expression of protein kinases a (pka) and g (pkg) were
determined by western blot as previously described by murthy
et al. (2002). kmup-1 was incubated with guinea-pig tsmcs
for 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 h. each of the cell lysates containing
1 mg of cellular protein was electrophoresed in 7.5% sds–
page and then transferred to pvdf membrane (millipore
corp., bedford, ma, u.s.a.). the membrane was stained with
ponceau s to verify the integrity of the transferred proteins
and to monitor the unbiased transfer of all protein samples.
the membrane was then washed with 25 ml of tbs (100 mm

nacl, 0.1% and 10 mm tris–hcl, ph 7.5) for 5 min at room
temperature and incubated in 25 ml of blocking buffer (tbs
plus 0.1% tween 20 and 5% nonfat milk) overnight at 41c. to
detect the protein of interest, the membrane was incubated
with appropriate pkari or pkg1a1b primary antibody (diluted
1 : 250) in 2 ml of blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature.
it was washed three times for 5 min each with 15 ml of tbst
(tbs plus 0.1% tween 20), incubated with hrp-conjugated
anti-mouse and anti-rabbit igg secondary antibody
(1 : 10,000) for pka and pkg, respectively, in 15 ml of
blocking buffer with gentle agitation for 1 h at room
temperature. finally, the membrane was washed three times
for 5 min each with 15 ml of tbst and then subject to ecl
(amersham life sciences inc., arlington heights, il, u.s.a.)
for the detection of specific antigen.

louis, mo, u.s.a.). pkari and pkg1a1b antibodies were
purchased from calbiochem co. (san diego, ca, u.s.a.). all
drugs and reagents were dissolved in distilled water, unless
noted otherwise. apamin was dissolved in 0.05 m acetic acid;
indomethacin was dissolved in 100 mm  xxxd3212xxx ;
chtx,  xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd2388xxx  and odq were dissolved in

serial dilutions were made in distilled water.

statistical evaluation of data
airway obstruction and lung function
guinea-pigs were anaesthetized with pentobarbitone
(40 mg kg1, i.p. initially and maintained with further doses
of 2–5 mg kg1, i.v. when required). the animal was tethered in
a supine position and the trachea was cannulated below the
larynx with a short cannula via a tracheotomy. tracheal
pressure was measured by a catheter connected to the side arm
of the tracheal cannula. the carotid artery and jugular vein
were cannulated for monitoring blood pressure and for drug
administration, respectively. throughout the experiment, the
body temperature of the guinea-pig was maintained at b371c
by means of a servo heating blanket. intrapleural pressure
was measured by a catheter inserted into the right intrapleural cavity via a surgical incision between the fifth and sixth
ribs. the incision was subsequently sutured and further sealed
with silicone jelly. transpulmonary pressure was measured
as the difference between tracheal pressure and intrapleural
pressure, using a differential pressure transducer (p300d,
validyne, northridge, ca, u.s.a.). respiratory flow was
measured with a pneumotachograph (no. 4/0, fleisch,
richmond, va, u.s.a.) coupled to a differential pressure
transducer (mp45-14, validyne), and was integrated to give
tidal volume. measurements were carried out as previously
described (hsu et al., 1998). total lung resistance (rl) and
dynamic lung compliance (cdyn) were measured on a breathby-breath basis with a computer equipped with an a/d
interface (das 1600, buxco) and software (version 1.5.7,
buxco electronics, inc, u.s.a.). results obtained from the
computer analysis were routinely checked for accuracy with
those calculated manually.
animals were allowed to stabilize for 10 min following
surgical manipulations before the test agent was administered.
intratracheal instillation was performed using a catheter
placed through the tracheal tube into the bronchial system.
the animals were pretreated with kmup-1 (1.0 mg kg1, i.v.)
or an equivalent volume of vehicle for 10 min before the
intratracheal  xxxg2296xxx  (0.01 mg kg1 in 300 ml of 0.9% saline),
was used to induce acute bronchoconstriction.

the results are expressed as mean7s.e.m. statistical differences were determined by independent and paired student’s
t-test in unpaired and paired samples, respectively. whenever
a control group was compared with more than one treated
group, the one-way anova or two-way repeated-measures
anova was used. when the anova manifested a statistical
difference, dunnett’s or student–newman–keuls test was
applied. a p-value less than 0.05 was considered to be
significant in all experiments. analysis of the data and plotting
of the figures were done with the aid of software (sigmaplot
version 8.0 and sigmastat version 2.03, chicago, il, u.s.a.)
run on an ibm compatible computer.

results
tracheal smooth muscle relaxant effects
kmup-1 (0.01–100 mm) caused concentration-dependent
relaxations in epithelium-intact (ep þ ) tracheal strips precontracted by carbachol. the concentration–response curve
for kmup-1 appeared to be biphasic, characterized by a
shallow foot and, at concentrations greater than 10 mm, a
steeper component (figure 2). no plateau phase was obtained,
even at quite high concentrations. consequently, it was not
possible to determine ec50 values for this agent. following
removal of the epithelium, a downward shift in the concentration–response curve for kmup-1-induced tracheal relaxation
was obtained. the magnitude of relaxations in denuded tissues
was significantly smaller than in intact preparation at all
concentrations between 0.1 and 100 mm (figure 2). thus,
kmup-1-induced relaxation of guinea-pig trachea is partly
dependent on an intact epithelium. we also observed that
relaxation in response to a nonselective pde inhibitor,
theophylline, and more selective inhibitors of  xxxg1695xxx , 4 and 5,
respectively, milrinone,  xxxd3142xxx  and zaprinast, were not
significantly affected by removal of the epithelium (data not
shown).
kmup-1 elicited maximal relaxations that exceeded 100%
of the magnitude of carbachol-induced contraction from
baseline tension. since all of our experiments were conducted
in the presence of indomethacin, which was added to abolish
the eicosanoid-dependent basal tension that is characteristic of
guinea-pig trachea, this is a surprising observation for which
we currently have no explanation. however, since we could not

ascertain the maximum relaxation in these experiments, and
since no plateau in the concentration–response curve was
obtained, ec50 values for kmup-1 could not be accurately
determined.
next, we also compared the relaxant effects of kmup-1
with those to the pde inhibitors theophylline,  xxxd2388xxx ,
milrinone,  xxxd3142xxx  and zaprinast, and a  xxxg1253xxx  opener,
levcromakalim, at 100 mm (figure 3). at this high concentration, we observed that, of these agents, kmup-1 and  xxxd2388xxx 
were the most effective at inducing tracheal relaxation; the
magnitude of the relaxation responses induced by kmup-1
and  xxxd2388xxx  were not significantly different.

kmup-1 and epithelium-derived trachea relaxation

measurement of  xxxd1773xxx  and gmp in cultured
tsmcs
we examined the effect of kmup-1 on  xxxd1773xxx  and gmp
levels in the presence of the nonselective pde inhibitor  xxxd2388xxx 
(100 mm) in primary cultures of guinea-pig tsmcs. the basal
release of  xxxd1773xxx  and  xxxd1274xxx  was 63.175.6 and
1.1270.08 pmol mg1 protein, respectively (n ¼ 3). kmup-1
(0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 mm) significantly increased both  xxxd1773xxx 
(90.275.3, 96.175.8, 113.377.1, 110.877.9 pmol mg1
protein) and gmp (1.4570.07, 1.6070.07, 1.6970.05,
1.7670.12 pmol mg1 protein) levels as compared with each
basal value. in addition, we observed the effects of kmup-1
alone, in the absence of  xxxd2388xxx , on both  xxxd1773xxx  and cyclic
gmp levels. the effects of kmup-1 in the absence of  xxxd2388xxx 
on  xxxd1773xxx  and  xxxd1274xxx  levels were not significantly
different from those in the presence of  xxxd2388xxx . we propose that
the pde inhibitory activity of kmup-1 per se is enough to
prevent the cyclic nucleotides breakdown.
moreover, we compared the  xxxd1773xxx  and gmp
levels obtained in the presence of kmup-1 to those with
theophylline, milrinone,  xxxd3142xxx  and zaprinast at 100 mm.
kmup-1, theophylline, milrinone and  xxxd3142xxx  all elicited
significant elevations of  xxxd1773xxx  accumulation, but this
was not so for the selective pde5 inhibitor zaprinast.
although kmup-1, theophylline and zaprinast significantly
enhanced the amounts of  xxxd1274xxx , this was not observed
with milrinone and  xxxd3142xxx , selective  xxxg1695xxx  and 4 inhibitors,
respectively (figure 6). furthermore, the raised cyclic
amp levels induced by kmup-1 and  xxxd1742xxx , an adenylyl
cyclase activator, were almost eliminated by pretreatment
with an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor sq 22536 (100 mm)
(table 1). likewise, the increased accumulation of cyclic
gmp induced by kmup-1 was abolished by pretreatment
with the nos inhibitor l-name or the sgc inhibitor odq
(table 2).

adenylyl cyclase inhibitor sq 22536 also attenuated the

the effect of kmup-1 on the expression of pka and pkg
was evaluated using the western blot technique. as shown
in figure 7, kmup-1 (10 mm) stimulated the expression of
immunoreactive pkari in a time-dependent manner. the
monoclonal antibody of pkari recognizes a band at 49 kda in
guinea-pig tsmcs. in addition, kmup-1 also stimulated the
expression of immunoreactive pkg1a1b in a time-dependent
manner (figure 8). the polyclonal antibody of pkg1a1b
recognizes a band at 75 kda. kmup-1 increased the level of
expression of both pka and pkg proteins, although this
did not achieve statistical significance until 9 h of exposure to
the drug.

enzyme activities were 2372.7, 1872.5 and 2973.1% (n ¼ 3),
respectively. similarly, the effects of theophylline (10 mm) on
 xxxg1695xxx , 4 and 5 were 871.0, 871.2 and 1272.1% (n ¼ 3). the
ic50 values of both agents were not estimated because 50%
inhibition was not achieved at concentrations up to 10 mm.
under these conditions,  xxxd2388xxx  was used as a reference agent
and its ic50 values for  xxxg1695xxx , 4 and 5 were 6.571.2, 26.373.9
and 31.775.3 mm (n ¼ 3), respectively.

discussion
it was established previously that kmup-1, derived from the
xanthine-based theophylline, induces vascular and corpus
cavernosum smooth muscle relaxations via inhibition of pdes,
opening of k þ channels and activation of the no/sgc/cyclic
gmp pathway (wu et al., 2001; lin et al., 2002). in this study,
we further observed that kmup-1 stimulates the accumulation of  xxxd1773xxx  and gmp and consequently activates the
expression of pkg1a1b and pkari in guinea-pig tsms. we
know that increased pka and pkg can stimulate k þ
outflow, leading to the blockade of ca2 þ influx-associated
contractility. thus, kmup-1-induced relaxation of guinea-pig

trachea appears to be the result of multiple intracellular
actions.
the role of phosphodiesterases in regulating smooth muscle
relaxation has received much interest in recent years. several
pde isoenzymes have been identified in airway smooth
muscle, although the proportion of these enzymes varies
between species and at different airway levels (barnes, 1995;
rabe et al., 1995).  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4 are important in the
breakdown of  xxxd1773xxx ;  xxxg1695xxx  is involved in the regulation
of airway smooth muscle tone, whereas pde4 is more
important in inflammatory cells, such as mast cells, macrophages, eosinophils, t-lymphocytes and epithelial cells. pde5
is involved in the breakdown of  xxxd1274xxx  in airway and
vascular smooth muscle (barnes, 1995). nonselective inhibitors of  xxxg1696xxx , such as theophylline, have been used for the treatment of obstructive airway
diseases for several decades (serafin, 1996). in our guinea-pig
isolated tsm experiments, we observed that kmup-1 was
more potent at inducing relaxant effects than the nonselective
and selective pde inhibitors, theophylline, milrinone,  xxxd3142xxx  and zaprinast, as well as the  xxxg1253xxx  opener
levcromakalim. notably, the response to kmup-1 was
significantly attenuated by pretreatment with the adenylyl
cyclase inhibitor sq 22536. these results encouraged us to
investigate further the underlying mechanism of the effect of
kmup-1 on guinea-pig trachea. in biological enzyme experiments, we demonstrated that kmup-1 affected cyclic nucleotide breakdown  xxxd1891xxx  mm. although it was not particularly
potent at producing this effect, it did inhibit the enzyme
activities of  xxxg1695xxx , 4 and 5. furthermore, kmup-1 and the
pde inhibitors theophylline, milrinone and  xxxd3142xxx  markedly
elevated the intracellular  xxxd1773xxx  levels. however, the
selective pde5 inhibitor zaprinast did not increase  xxxd1773xxx

and was treated as a negative control. sq 22536 completely
abolished the raised  xxxd1773xxx  levels induced by kmup-1,
as did the adenylyl cyclase activator  xxxd1742xxx . hence, kmup1-induced tsm relaxation could be due to activation of the
adenylyl cyclase pathway and also to inhibition of the  xxxg1695xxx 
and 4 enzymes. previous studies have indicated that the
combination of  xxxg1695xxx  and 4 inhibitors is most effective in
relaxing airway smooth muscle, suggesting that co-operation
of the two isoenzymes  xxxg1695xxx  and 4 is needed for optimal
bronchodilator effects (de boer et al., 1992).
no is generally accepted to play an important role in the
regulation of the airway function. several no-related compounds, such as snp, and endogenous no activate sgc,
elevate  xxxd1274xxx  and relax airway smooth muscles (katsuki
& murad, 1977). no has been shown to be a relaxant
transmitter between epithelium and smooth muscle in guineapig tracheas and in human airways due to its ability to activate
sgc (tucker et al., 1990). since kmup-1 was still able to
evoke a trachea relaxant effect in epithelium-denuded tracheal
strips or during inhibition of nos, it is likely to have a direct
action on tsm that does not involve the epithelium. however,
at least part of the response to kmup-1 is epitheliumdependent because a significant downward shift in the dose–
response curve was observed after epithelium denudation. in
addition, we demonstrated that the tracheal relaxant effect of
kmup-1 was significantly attenuated, but not completely
inhibited, by pretreatment with the sgc inhibitor odq.

b.-n. wu et al

kmup-1 markedly increased the intracellular accumulation of
 xxxd1274xxx  and this response was completely eliminated by
the nos inhibitor l-name and the sgc inhibitor odq. this
suggests that under these conditions the kmup-1-induced
tsm relaxations are mediated by activation of the no/sgc
pathway, inhibition of pde5, and the resulting accumulation
of  xxxd1274xxx . indeed, these results accord with those
previously observed in rat aortic (wu et al., 2001) and rabbit
corpus cavernosum smooth muscles (lin et al., 2002).
there is evidence suggesting that no is capable of directly
stimulating ca þ 2-dependent k þ channels in smooth muscle
cells (bolotina et al., 1994), including airway smooth muscle
(abderrahmane et al., 1998), which leads to hyperpolarization
and decreases in ca2 þ influx and subsequently causes
relaxation (lincoln & cornwell, 1991). to investigate whether
these k þ channels are also involved in guinea-pig tsm
relaxation responses to kmup-1, the preparation was
pretreated with various k þ channel blockers. we observed
that the ability of these k þ channel blockers to reduce the
responses to kmup-1 was relatively weak, with the exception
of apamin. thus, the relaxant responses to kmup-1 appear to
be due to a more selective effect on the small-conductance
ca2 þ -dependent k þ channels in guinea-pig tsms. this result
also confirms our hypothesis that kmup-1 stimulates k þ
efflux, which in turn causes hyperpolarization and relaxation
of guinea-pig tsms.
in our isolated tissue experiments, the tracheal relaxation
response to kmup-1 occurs within a few minutes and its
concentration–response curve appears to be biphasic. from
these results, we propose that at least two distinct signalling
pathways are involved in the kmpu-1–induced tracheal
relaxations: the fast response is probably caused by the
activation of k þ channels, whereas the slow response is
mediated via the accumulation of intracellular cyclic nucleotide
accumulation due to an effect on protein kinases. this would
account for the rapid tracheal relaxation response to kmup-1
and the significant change in the protein expression of either
pka or pkg not being observed until after 9 h in cultured
tsmcs. in this study, we also demonstrated that kmup-1
exhibits a time-dependent increase in the expression of proteins
pkari and pkg1a1b in cultured tsmcs. taken together, these
results indicate that the tsm relaxation responses to kmup-1
are mediated via two major pathways: one involves activation
of k þ channels and is independent of cellular cyclic
nucleotides; the other is probably mediated by increases in
both  xxxd1773xxx  and  xxxd1274xxx , followed by stimulation of
pka and pkg cascades. increased pka and pkg appear to
activate k þ channels, resulting in the lowering of cellular
ca2 þ levels (figure 10). the precise mechanism by which
kmup-1 activates the k þ channels remains to be elucidated
by use of conventional ruptured patch-recording techniques.
however, kmup-1 has been confirmed to open ca2 þ dependent k þ channels directly in rat cerebral vascular
smooth muscle cells (data not shown).

figure 10 proposed mechanisms of action of kmup-1 on guineapig tracheal epithelium and smooth muscle cells. kmup-1 activates
the no/sgc/ xxxd1274xxx  and ac/ xxxd1773xxx  pathways and
subsequently increases the intracellular levels of  xxxd1773xxx  and
 xxxd1274xxx . additionally, kmup-1 inhibits pde4 and 5-specific
enzymes for  xxxd1773xxx  and  xxxd1274xxx , respectively. increased
 xxxd1773xxx  and  xxxd1274xxx  then activate the protein kinases pka

cells. ac indicates adenylate cyclase.

infection, including those found in the trachea or airway
system (hakonarson et al., 1996). since kmup-1 enhances
cyclic nucleotide levels and inhibits the activity of pdes, we
decided to investigate the ability of kmup-1 to protect
against intratracheal  xxxg2296xxx -induced airway obstruction,
which probably results from both bronchoconstriction and
oedema. the acute  xxxg2296xxx -induced bronchoconstriction was
manifested as a prominent increase in rl with a concomitant
decrease in cdyn. our results showed that  xxxg2296xxx -induced
increases in rl and reduction in cdyn could be reversed by
kmup-1. this indicates that kmup-1 inhibits the onset of
 xxxg2296xxx -mediated bronchoconstriction. indeed, we also found
that kmup-1 attenuated the  xxxg2296xxx -induced increased
expression of both  xxxg1578xxx  (inos) and cyclooxygenase
ii (cox-ii) associated with inflammatory responses (data not
shown).
in summary, we have provided evidence that the relaxation
of guinea-pig isolated trachea induced by the xanthine
derivative kmup-1 is a result of several intracellular actions
of this drug. these include sgc activation, inhibition of pdes,
an additional epithelium-derived effect, elevation of intracellular  xxxd1773xxx  and gmp levels, increased expression of
cyclic nucleotide-dependent pka and pkg and associated
k þ channel openings.
