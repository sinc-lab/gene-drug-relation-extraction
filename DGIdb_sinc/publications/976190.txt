adrenal appeared to be less sensitive to canrenone.
all three agents or their hydroxylated metabolites
blocked 18-hydroxylation in bovine adrenal at
lower concentrations. canrenoate-k, being the most
effective, inhibited 52% at 20 /xm. low concentrations of canrenone (2.5-5.0 /xm) were without effect
on 11/3-hydroxylase but markedly inhibited 18hydroxylation (62-76%) in hyperplastic human
adrenals. the inhibitors produced mixed type
inhibition of lljs-hydroxylation and competitive
type inhibition of 18-hydroxylation. these findings
indicate that at low concentrations spironolactone
and its major metabolites, canrenone and canrenoatek, or their hydroxylated metabolites, can directly
interfere with the biosynthesis of aldosterone in
bovine and certain human adrenal cortical tissue.

abstract. effects of spironolactone, canrenone and
canrenoate-k on adrenal cytochrome p450 (p450)
and corticosteroid biosynthesis were examined by
studying difference spectra, p450 reduction and
corticoid hydroxylation in mitochondrial preparations isolated from zona fasciculata and zona glomerulosa of bovine adrenals and from adrenal adenoma
and hyperplastic adrenal cortex removed from patients with hyperaldosteronism. all three agents
bound to p450 producing type i difference spectra
and underwent hydroxylation. they all inhibited
11/3-hydroxylation in bovine adrenal at 30 /xm and
higher concentrations. canrenone, the most potent
inhibitor, blocked enzyme activity by 60% at a concentration of 60 /xm. spironolactone stimulated
p450 reduction. the order of potency of inhibition
was found to correlate with the order of affinity
of these agents for p450. 11/3-hydroxylase in human

t has long been recognized that the
mineralocorticoid antagonist, spironolactone5 ( xxxd3238xxx ), acts on renal tubules
to block the action of mineralocorticoids in
reabsorption of sodium and chloride and the
excretion of potassium, hydrogen and ammonium ions (1,2). the correction of the
electrolyte abnormalities and hypertension
in most patients with primary aldosteronism

by this drug (3,4) is believed to result
from its competitive inhibition of mineralocorticoid renal receptors (5). although the
renal effect of this drug is established, its
direct effect on corticosteroid biosynthesis is
still controversial. davidson et al. (6) reported that in man spironolactone treatment did not significantly alter the urinary
aldosterone level, secretion rate of aldo-

levels. they also found that spironolactone
had little or no effect on urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids and urinary 17-ketosteroids.
other investigators have demonstrated that
spironolactones caused an increased production of aldosterone in vivo, as a result
of activation of the renin-angiotensin system
by the loss of sodium induced by spironolactones (7). kittinger et al. (8) found an
increased formation of aldosterone and a
decreased production of corticosterone by
rat hemi-adrenals from animals treated for 12
weeks with spironolactone (sc-8109). more
recent studies by erbler demonstrated that
spironolactone ( xxxd3238xxx ) and canrenone
(sc-9376) at high concentrations (6 x 1(t 5 m
to 1 x 10~ 4 m) inhibited the synthesis of
aldosterone (9) and corticosterone (10) in
rat adrenal quarters. to clarify further the
pharmacological significance and the mechanism of action of spironolactone on corticosteroid biosynthesis, we have examined
the effects of spironolactone ( xxxd3238xxx ) and
its major metabolites, canrenone and canrenoate-k (sc-14266) on steroid substrate
interaction with mitochondrial cytochrome
p450 and their effects on 11/3-hydroxylase
and 18-hydroxylase activities in mitochondria from bovine adrenal cortex and
human adrenal adenoma and hyperplastic
glands.
materials and methods
preparation of tissue
fresh bovine adrenal glands collected on
crushed ice were dissected from the adherent
fat and medulla. the fraction of the cortical
tissue consisting of zona fasciculata and reticularis was first scraped away and combined.
the remaining thin layer, the zona glomerulosa
(~1.0 mm) attached to the capsule was kept wet
with sucrose solution and completely scraped
away from connective tissue. homogenization
and fractionation of the tissue was carried out
in 0.25m sucrose-1% bovine  xxxg124xxx -l.o
mm edta (ph 7.4). mitochondrial fractions
were prepared as described previously (11),
and were suspended in the same medium to a
concentration of approximately 10 mg protein/ml.

human adrenal glands with an adenoma, and
a hyperplastic adrenal were obtained from patients adrenalectomized for treatment of primary
aldosteronism. mitochondria from the adenoma
tissue, the surrounding 'normal' tissue and from
the hyperplastic adrenal cortical tissue were isolated, and fat and red blood cells were carefully
excluded as described by wilson et al. (12).
difference spectra and incubation conditions
difference spectra and apparent spectral dissociation constants (k's) of substrates and inhibitors in mitochondrial preparations were obtained
as described previously (11). incubations were
carried out at 37 c in air with a medium containing 6.5 mm na2hpo4, 1.5 mm kh2po4,
6.4 mm mgci2 and 48.0 mm kc1 (ph 7.2),
mitochondria and various concentrations of substrate in a 2 ml volume. for determination of
11/3-hydroxylase activity in the mitochondria, 5
to 20 ixm deoxycorticosterone (doc) or 11deoxycortisol were incubated with 0.15 /aci of
the corresponding u c-labeled compound. the
reaction was started by adding 0.4 mm nadp
and 10 mm malate unless otherwise indicated.
in the studies of 18-hydroxylation, bovine adrenal
glomerulosa mitochondria or human adrenal
mitochondrial preparations were incubated with
0.65 to 1.65 /u,m corticosterone mixed with 14clabeled corticosterone (0.075 /xci) as substrate,
5 iu of  xxxg825xxx ,
and 4 mm glucose-6-phosphate. the reaction was
initiated by the simultaneous addition of 0.4 mm
nadp and 10 mm malate. aliquots from the
incubation mixture were taken at 0.5, 1 and 1.5
min intervals for assay of 11/3-hydroxylation
activity, and at 5, 10 and 30 min intervals for
analysis of 18-hydroxylation activity. the aliquots were extracted twice with 10 ml chc13
in the presence of steroid carriers (25-50 fig).
measurement and identification of incubation
products
the chloroform extracts of aliquots from the
11/3-hydroxylase assays were chromatographed
in a benzene-formamide system when doc
was the substrate, and in a chloroform-formamide
system when deoxycortisol was the substrate
(12). the chloroform extracts for 18-hydroxylase
activity were chromatographed in the bush b2
system for 6 hours. quantitation of 14c-labeled
products was done as reported previously (12).

results

difference spectra of spironolactone, canrenone and canrenoate-k and their effects
on steroid-induced difference spectra
as in the case of steroid substrates,
spironolactone, canrenone and canrenoatek produced type i difference spectra in mitochondria of bovine adrenal cortex (fig. 1).
canrenone produced a similar spectral
change in mitochondria from hyperplastic
human adrenals (fig. 1). titrations of bovine
adrenocortical mitochondria demonstrated
characteristic apparent spectral dissociation
constants (k's) for each compound (table 2).
canrenone had the lowest k's value suggesting the highest affinity for p450, followed by canrenoate-k, and then spironolac-

canrenoate-k on 11 (5-hydroxylase activity
as shown in table 3, the relative rate of
11/3-hydroxylation of doc to corticosterone
was reduced by all three agents. canrenone
was the most effective inhibitor followed by
canrenoate-k, and then spironolactone. this
order of potency for blocking 11/3-hydroxylation correlates with the order of affinity of
these agents for p450 (table 2). analysis

three agents indicating a mixed type inhibition. the kj values for inhibition of 11/8hydroxylation were higher than the spectral
inhibition constants.
canrenone has been shown to be the
major metabolite in plasma from patients
following oral administration of spironolactone. because of this and the limited amount
of human tissue, canrenone was chosen
for more extensive study with human
adrenal preparations. table 4 shows that
11/8-hydroxylation by human adrenal cortical mitochondria whether from normal,
adenomatous or hyperplastic tissue is not
markedly inhibited by canrenone/substrate
ratios of 0.7 to 2.8 (8-14%). increasing the
canrenone/substrate ratio to 12.0 in one
study of frozen hyperplastic adrenal cortical
mitochondria resulted in 38% inhibition.
bovine adrenal cortical mitochondria appear
to be more sensitive to this inhibitor as
judged by the data in table 3 where a
canrenone/doc ratio of 9.5 resulted in 60%
inhibition of 11/3-hydroxylation.

incubation conditions were as described under
"methods." relative rates shown were calculated from
3 experiments carried out with 6.4 fim doc, 0.42 mg
mitochondrial protein containing 0.37  xxxd2136xxx  p450 in a
total vol of 2 ml. incubation time was 1 min. the control
rate was 24.2-34.8 nmol corticosterone formed/mg
protein/min. duplicate measurements in the same
experiment differed by less than 5%.

glomerulosa produced three 14c-labeled
products; two chromatographing in the region of 18-oh-corticosterone (18-ohb) and
one corresponding to 14c-labeled aldosterone. the less polar product migrating
in the region of 18-ohb was converted to
the more polar product after rechromatography in the same system without any
chemical treatment. when both products
were mixed with authentic tritiated 18ohb, oxidized by periodate and cro3,
and rechromatographed in the same system,
the 3h/14c ratio remained constant (table 1),
although the rf values changed to those of
the etiolactones of 18-hydroxy-corticosterone and of 18-hydroxy-ll-dehydrocorticosterone. consequently, the less polar
peak in the 18-ohb region appears to be
the 18-20-cyclic hemiketal form described
by nicolis and ulick (14). the 18-ohb,
18-20-cyclic hemiketal and aldosterone
radioactivites were summed to estimate 18hydroxylase activity. three experiments
were performed with bovine adrenal mitochondria of zona glomerulosa tissue. the

inhibition of 18-hydroxylation by spironolactone, canrenone and canrenoate-k
was 17-26%, 10-28%, and 33-52%, respectively, at concentrations of 10-20 /am when
inhibitor/substrate concentration ratio was
8.9-17.4 (table 5). graphical analysis of
data obtained from kinetic studies showed
that all three agents competitively inhibited
18-hydroxylase. figure 3 shows the lineweaver-burk plots of data from the spironolactone and canrenoate-k studies.

a similar pattern of conversion products
was isolated from incubations of mitochondria from human adrenal adenoma or
hyperplastic adrenal cortex with corticosterone, as from bovine mitochondria of zona
glomerulosa tissue. table 6 shows that
in adenoma tissue, 60% and 93% inhibition of 18-hydroxylase was observed with
30 (jlm canrenone when the canrenone/substrate ratio was 9.6 and 34.5, respectively.
in hyperplastic adrenal tissue, canrenone
was also a potent inhibitor of 18-hydroxylase, achieving 76% inhibition at an inhibitor/substrate ratio of 4.3. spironolactone,
on the other hand, produced only a 30%
inhibition of 18-hydroxylase at an inhibitor/
substrate ratio of 9.0. lineweaver-burk plots
of these studies (fig. 4) indicate that as in
the case of bovine mitochondria, these
agents are competitive inhibitors of 18hydroxylase. however, the k( values for both
inhibitors were lower than those obtained
with bovine tissue. in the human hyperplastic tissue, the kj (1.2 /am) for canrenone
was even lower than the apparent km
(2 /xm) for corticosterone (table 6), while
the kj for spironolactone (12.5 (jlm) was
ten times higher than that for canrenone.

spironolactone, p450 and corticosteroids
indicates that 18-hydroxylase is much more
sensitive to canrenone. at low inhibitor
concentrations where no significant inhibition of 11/3-hydroxylase was observed,
canrenone markedly inhibited 18-hydroxylase activity.
effect of spironolactone, canrenone, and
canrenoate-k on cytochrome p450 reduction
in order to investigate whether these
inhibitors would affect the electron transport system from nadp to the hydroxylase
complex, the reduction of p450 was studied
with the mitochondrial preparations from
bovine zona fasciculata and zona glomerulosa using malate and nadp as electron
donor. as reported earlier by us (11) and
other investigators (15), biphasic reduction
kinetics with a fast first order and a slow
second order reaction were seen in such
studies in the absence and in the presence
of steroid substrate or of both substrate and
inhibitor. table 7 shows the first order rate
constants for p450 reduction under various
conditions. doc and spironolactone produced stimulation of p450 reduction, while
the two metabolites of spironolactone produced neither stimulation nor inhibition.
when both doc and inhibitor were present, there was no significant interference
with doc's capacity to stimulate p450 reum canrenoate-k

adrenal adenoma mitochondria containing 0.8 mg protein (p450
concentration was not measured) were used for each incubation.
* incubation was done with frozen mitochondria 24 days after operation. in experiments with hyperplastic adrenal, 1.0 mg mitochondrial
protein containing 0.46 /xm p450 was used in each incubation. incubation time was 30 min in all cases. substrate concentration for hyperplastic
adrenal was 1.15 mm corticosterone.

duction. these results indicate that these
agents by themselves do not interfere with
electron transport and reduction of p450
which are essential steps for oxygen activation and hydroxylation of steroid substrate
(17). no type i difference spectrum could
be detected for corticosterone in glomerulosa mitochondria. one explanation may be
that the concentration of 18-hydroxylase is
below the sensitivity of our spectral measurement. in addition, no significant stimulation of p450 reduction was observed with
corticosterone in glomerulosa mitochondria
(table 7).
metabolism of spironolactone, canrenone in
adrenal mitochondria
judging from the structural similarity of
spironolactone and its metabolites to steroid
substrates, their interaction with p450, and
spironolactone's stimulation of p450 reduction, it appeared likely that spironolactone
was hydroxylated by p450. incubation of

fig. 4. lineweaver-burk plots of the data from study
on the effect of spironolactone and canrenone on 18hydroxylation of corticosterone in mitochondria of
human hyperplastic adrenal from a patient with hyperaldosteronism. conditions were identical with those
described under table 6 for hyperplastic adrenal.

spironolactone and canrenone with mitochondrial preparations from zona fasciculata
and zona glomerulosa showed that these
preparations were capable of metabolizing
spironolactone and canrenone to two more
polar metabolites, m, and mn (mi rf = 0.25
and mh rf = 0.30). in fasciculata mitochondria, the initial rate of metabolism of
30 /xm spironolactone and canrenone was 24
and 36 nmol/mg protein/min, respectively.
in bovine glomerulosa mitochondria,
canrenone was metabolized at the rate of
0.24 nmol/mg protein/min when the incubation time was one hour (table 8). mitochondria from human adrenal adenoma were
also capable of metabolizing these agents.
sufficient amounts of the two metabolites
for mass spectral study were isolated by
incubating 0.34 mg canrenone with bovine
adrenal fasciculata mitochondria for two
hours. the mass spectra of these metabolites showed molecular ions (m+) at m/e
356 which indicates hydroxylation of canrenone (m/e 340). in addition, strong fragment ions were observed at m/e 338 (m+h2o) and m/e 323 (m+-h2o, ch3) for m,
and at m/e 338 (m+-h2o) for mn. these
metabolites (mj and mu) may be identical
to those obtained from incubations of rat
adrenal sections by erbler (10) who tenta-

the present studies show that spironolactone and two of its major metabolites, canrenone and canrenoate-k bind to p450 producing type i difference spectra in both
bovine glomerulosa mitochondria and human aldosterone-producing hyperplastic
adrenal mitochondria. they compete with
the normal substances for 11/3- and 18hydroxylation and spironolactone and canrenone, at least, are hydroxylated. the
effect of the hydroxylated metabolites of
spironolactone and canrenone on the 11/3and 18-hydroxylases cannot be estimated
from our present studies. but erbler (18)
has reported that 11/3-hydroxylated spironolactone (ll/8-hydroxy-sc5233) selectively
inhibits aldosterone production in rat
adrenal tissue. a 50% inhibition of aldosterone production by ll/3-hydroxy-sc5233

spironolactone, p450 and corticosteroids
was obtained at a concentration of 70  xxxd2136xxx ,
while only 50% inhibition of corticosterone
production was obtained at 400 /am (18).
if the hydroxylated metabolites of spironolactone ( xxxd3238xxx ) and canrenone behaved
the same as ll/3-hydroxy-sc5233, they
would have no significant influence on 11/3hydroxylation of doc in our studies because of the low inhibitor concentrations
(16-60 fim) and short incubation time (1
min) used. less than 5% conversion was
observed in 2 min. however, their effect
on 18-hydroxylation cannot be ruled out
due to the longer incubation times (2-30
min) used.
menard et al. (19,20) have recently reported that administration of spironolactone to several species of animals leads to a
destruction of microsomal p450 in testicular
and adrenal tissue. no alteration in p450
concentrations was observed with mitochondrial preparations used in our spectral
studies up to 1.5 h at room temperature.
thus, it appears unlikely that the inhibitory
effects of spironolactone and its metabolites
on 11/8- and 18-hydroxylation found in our
in vitro studies are due to a loss of mitochondrial p450.
canrenone in a concentration (2.5 (jlm)
normally achieved in plasma of patients
following oral administration of 400 mg of
spironolactone (21), markedly inhibited
(62%) formation of 18-ohb and aldosterone
from corticosterone without affecting 11/3hydroxylation. in view of the relatively long
half-life of canrenone in plasma (17-22 h),
the rapid metabolism of spironolactone to
this agent following oral administration
(79% conversion over 3 - 1 2 h (21)) and its
marked inhibition of 18-hydroxylation, it
seems likely that canrenone may contribute
significantly to the therapeutic effect of
spironolactone.
these findings support and extend the
earlier findings of erbler (9,10) and also
suggest that spironolactone and its major
metabolites, in addition to antagonizing
aldosterone action at renal tubular receptor
sites (1,2,21), may also directly interfere with

the biosynthesis of aldosterone in bovine

this notion is supported by the recent clinical studies of sundsfjord et al. (22) who
found that patients with primary aldosteronism treated with spironolactone had a
decreased rate of secretion of aldosterone.
