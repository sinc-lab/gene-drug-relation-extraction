objective : cerebral vasospasm leading to cerebral ischemic infarction is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the patients who suffer
with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. despite adequate treatment, some patients deteriorate and they develop symptomatic vasospasm.
the objective of the present study was to investigate the efficacy and clinical outcome of intraarterial  xxxd2728xxx  infusion on symptomatic
vasospasm that is refractory to hemodynamic therapy.
methods : we retrospectively reviewed the procedure reports, the clinical charts and the transcranial doppler, computed tomography and digital
subtraction angiography results for the patients who underwent endovascular treatment for symptomatic cerebral vasospasm due to aneurysmal
sah. during the 36 months between jan. 2005 and dec. 2007, 19 patients were identified who had undergone a total of 53 procedures. we
assessed the difference in the arterial vessel diameter, the blood flow velocity and the clinical outcome before and after these procedures.
results : vascular dilatation was observed in 42 of 53 procedures. the velocities of the affected vessels before and after procedures were
available in 33 of 53 procedures. twenty-nine procedures exhibited a mean decrease of 84.1 cm/s. we observed clinical improvement and an
improved level of consciousness with an improved gcs score after 23 procedures.
conclusion : based on our results, the use of intraarterial  xxxd2728xxx  is effective and safe in selected cases of vasospasm following aneurysmal
sah. prospective, randomized studies are needed to confirm these results.
key words : subarachnoid hemorrhage ˙ vasospasm ˙ intraarterial  xxxd2728xxx  infusion.

introduction
cerebral vasospasm is the most common cause of acute
focal cerebral ischemia after an aneurysmal subarachnoid
hemorrhage. vasospasm is defined as the delayed, reversible
narrowing of the cerebral vessels. this condition most
commonly involves the proximal arteries that make up the
circle of willis, and it typically occurs 4 to 14 days after
subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah).
the incidence of nontraumatic sah ranges from
7.8/100,000 to 21.4/100,000, while symptomatic vasospasm
occurs in about one third of the patients who have sah.
approximately one third of these sah patients die from

the vasospasm, and another one third are left disabled, and
so vasospasm is a dreaded complication following sah13,14).
the clinical evidence suggests that calcium channel
blockers inhibit the constriction of the vascular smooth
muscle cells, and so this can reduce the incidence of delayed
ischemic deficits. therefore, the intravenous or oral application of  xxxd2728xxx  is currently recommended as the firstline medication to prevent vasospasm15,21). however, despite
adequate treatment, some patients deteriorate and develop
symptomatic vasospasm. in these cases, hypertension,
hypervolemia and hemodilution (triple-h) therapy is generally used.
for symptomatic vasospasm that is refractory to hemodynamic therapy, endovascular strategies such as balloon
angioplasty and intraarterial spasmolysis with papaverine or
 xxxd2728xxx  have been recommended.
more recently, major clinical centers have been utilizing
intraarterial  xxxd2728xxx  in patients with symptomatic
vasospasm to successfully treat cerebral vasospasm2,10). the

objective of the present study was to investigate the efficacy
and the clinical outcome of intraarterial  xxxd2728xxx  infusion
by assessing the patients’ clinical conditions with performing transcranial doppler (tcd), digital subtraction angiography (dsa).
materials and methods
patient population

at our department, all patients admitted for sah, as
confirmed by computed tomography (ct) or lumbar puncture, are examined by means of four-vessel angiography or
in rare cases, ct angiography. during the 36 months
between jan. 2005 and dec. 2007, 270 patients presented
with sah due to a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. in 237
of 270 patients, the aneurysm was treated by a neurosurgical procedure, 33 patients underwent an endovascular
procedure. among the 270 patients, 19 (7.0%) had findings
compatible with symptomatic vasospasm that was refractory to hemodynamic therapy. therefore, these patients
underwent cerebral angiography for intraarterial  xxxd2728xxx  infusion.
we retrospectively reviewed patients’ clinical charts and
the procedural reports. six women and thirteen men (mean
age : 51.3 ± 12.5 years) received treatment. in 17 of 19
patients (89.5%), the aneurysm was treated by a neurosurgical procedure, whereas only 2 patients (10.5%) underwent

an endovascular procedure.
a total of 53 endovascular  xxxd2728xxx  infusions were
performed in 19 patients. the patients experienced symptomatic vasospasm from day 5 through day 19 after sah
(mean days after sah : 9.6 ± 3.1 days).
at admission, the patients’ clinical condition was assessed
using the hunt-hess grading scale. the ct scan images
were evaluated according to fisher’s classification. the
patients’ characteristics are summarized in table 1.
all patients received  xxxd2728xxx  (as an intravenous or
oral drug) upon the diagnosis of aneurysmal sah. this
treatment was continued until 21st day for the patients
who developed vasospasm. the drug was temporarily
suspended only if refractory hypotension or hypoxemia
developed.
indications for treatment

patients were considered for undergoing angiography and
chemical angioplasty if they showed at least one of the
following conditions : 1) altered consciousness or clinical
worsening based on the glasgow coma scale (gcs) scores,
2) neurological deficits that were referable to the vascular
territory of the angiographic vasospasm, 3) a mean flow
velocity > 200 cm/s with a ratio of the middle cerebral
artery (mca) to the internal carotid artery (ica) mean
flow velocities greater than 3 (the lindegaard ratio) or 4) an
increase of the blood velocity above 50 cm/s/day.

ia  xxxd2728xxx  infusion in cerebral vasospasm | jh kim, et al.

when vasospasm was suspected, cerebral ct scanning
was first performed to exclude other causes of clinical
deficits such as hydrocephalus or rebleeding. the patients
who had cerebral infarction related to cerebral vasospasm,
as indicated by ct scans, were excluded. afterward, the
patients underwent diagnostic angiography to confirm the
vasospasm. intraarterial  xxxd2728xxx  was administered only
in the patients with angiographic evidence of a spasm in a
territory compatible with the neurologic deficit or in those
territories with a substantially elevated mean flow velocity,
as determined by a tcd study.
patients were considered for repetitive intraarterial  xxxd2728xxx  treatment if they showed at least one of the following conditions at the day after procedure : 1) altered
consciousness or clinical worsening based on the gcs
scores, 2) sustained continued neurologic deficit, and 3)
sustained continued blood velocity.
nineteen patients were treated with intraarterial  xxxd2728xxx  infusion for vasospasm. in most patients, this was
performed at least twice, therefore, a total of 53 endovascular procedures were performed (mean : 2.8 ± 1.6 procedures/patients).

the spasms were graded as mild when the arterial narrowing was < 50% and as severe when the narrowing was
> 50%. the initial admission angiogram, which was without any obvious vasospasm, was used as a reference and this
was compared with the pre- and post-treatment angiograms.
the degree of vasospasm was severe in 7 procedures and
mild in 46 procedures. the internal carotid artery on the
side of the vasospastic cerebral vessels was the only vessel
infused in 25 of 53 procedures (47.2%).  xxxd2728xxx  was
infused into both internal carotid arteries in 28 procedures.
these procedures were performed by neuroradiologists.
the angiographic response was graded as poor if there
was no improvement in vessel caliber, good if most of the
treated vessels improved, and excellent if vessels normalized
in vessel caliber.
tcd evaluation

assessment of the flow velocity in the major intracerebral
vessels by means of tcd monitoring was performed, yet
complete results were available for review for only 33
procedures.
clinical evaluation

angiographic evaluation

diagnostic angiography and subsequent chemical
angioplasty were performed within 12 hours of the onset of
symptomatic vasospasm that is refractory to hemodynamic
therapy in all the cases. the same as in the previous studies19,20,22), a spasm observed on the pretreatment angiogram
was assessed semiquantitatively and subjectively by neuroradiologists.
a diagnostic catheter was inserted into the cervical
internal carotid artery on the side of the vasospasm. the
infusion catheter didn’t have to select the ophthalmic artery
and to advance to the more distal ica, which was involved
in the vasospasm. a dose of 10 mg  xxxd2728xxx  (50 ml of
 xxxd2728xxx ) was prepared after dilution with 50 ml of
physiologic saline (to obtain a 10% dilution). slow continuous infusion of the solution at a rate of 1 ml/min (0.5
ml/min  xxxd2728xxx , 0.1 mg/min  xxxd2728xxx ) was achieved
by using an electric pump. the dose of  xxxd2728xxx  infused
intraarterially was 1-3 mg per treated vessel and the total
dose of  xxxd2728xxx  infused intraarterially for a given
patient was maintained within 5 mg. in unilateral procedures of vasospasm, depending on the severity of vasospasm
and patients’ conditions, an intraarterial infusion of  xxxd2728xxx  1-3 mg was performed. in bilateral procedures of
vasospasm,  xxxd2728xxx  3 mg was infused to the more severe
side and  xxxd2728xxx  2 mg was infused to the less severe
side.

clinical assessment was obtained from the clinical chart
and using the gcs scores immediately after intraarterial
 xxxd2728xxx  infusion.
the outcomes for the patients at discharge were assessed
using the glasgow outcome scale (gos) score. a favorable
outcome consisted of a gos score indicating good recovery
(grade 5) or moderate disability (grade 4). unfavorable
outcomes were severe disability (grade 3), a vegetative state
(grade 2) and death (grade 1).
results
angiographic results

in 16 patients, vasospasm of the total ica, mca and
anterior cerebral artery (aca) was found with the total
ica and mca being involved in two patients and the total
ica and aca being involved in one patient.
notable vascular dilatation was observed in 42 of 53 procedures. the angiographic response, as previously assessed,
was excellent in 11 and good in 31 endovascular procedures. vasospasm never worsened after the intraarterial
 xxxd2728xxx  infusion (table2).
tcd results

the velocities of the affected vessels before and after
endovascular treatment were available for 33 of 53 procedures. in 4 procedures, the velocity before and after endo-

and 29 procedures exhibited a
decrease of velocity (mean change of
velocity after endovascular  xxxd2728xxx  treatment : 84.1 ± 31.8 cm/s).
the velocities before and after endovascular treatment were never increased
(table 2).
clinical results

in 23 procedures, clinical improvement and an improved level of consciousness with an improved gcs
score were observed.
the outcomes for patients at discharge were observed (table 2).
discussion
cerebral vasospasm following a
aneurysmal sah continues to be a
leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and cerebral vasospasm is a
significant independent risk factor for
a poor outcome after a sah1,9,12).
because vasospasm is first and the
foremost a hemodynamic problem,
the current treatment measures are
geared toward optimizing cerebral
perfusion and minimizing the secondary brain injury. hypervolemia and
hypertension, in addition to oral  xxxd2728xxx , are the conceptual mainstays
to achieve this goal.
for those patients whose condition
are refractory to maximal medical therapy, endovascular treatment remains
an important therapeutic intervention
to mechanically and chemically
address the cerebral vasospasm.
mechanical angioplasty has been
used most effectively in reversing a
vasospasm in the large, proximal segments of the cerebral vessels and these
are composed of thick muscular walls.
however, angioplasty of distal vessels
is not possible. many patients have
tortuous vessels, and this makes access
difficult. mechanical angioplasty of
the intracranial vessels is associated

ia  xxxd2728xxx  infusion in cerebral vasospasm | jh kim, et al.

with a risk of vessel rupture, vessel perforation, thromboembolic events, intracranial hemorrhage, arterial dissection, reperfusion injury and hemorrhage from unsecured
aneurysms. major complication rates of 4% to 6% are typically reported18). further, systemic anticoagulation therapy
is also necessary.
intraarterial papaverine infusion has been the mainstay of
endovascular vasospasm treatment. intraarterially administered papaverine has been shown to increase the diameter
of vasospastic vessels as well as to improve the cerebral
circulation times16). papaverine is thought to have a direct
inhibitory effect on smooth-muscle contraction. in recent
reports, intraarterial papaverine administration has been
associated with a risk of cortical necrosis, elevated intracranial pressure (icp), permanent toxic effects to the
human brain (including monocular blindness, brain stem
dysfunction and seizure), other transient focal neurological
deficits and formation of crystal emboli2).
the limitations of papaverine infusion have led to experimentation with using other pharmacological agents. in
several studies, investigators have demonstrated that calcium antagonists (e.g.,  xxxd2718xxx , nifedipine, verapamil,
 xxxd2728xxx  etc.) reduce the proportion of patients with a
poor outcome and ischemic neurological deficits after
aneurysmal sah17).
other treatments, such as the intrathecal delivery of nitricoxide donors, the systemic administration of endothelin
receptors antagonists or various inhibitors of phosphodiesterase enzymes, are also under intensive investigation, but
their clinical efficacy has not yet been demonstrated4).
 xxxd2728xxx  is a specific blocker of the l-type voltagegated calcium channels7). the contractile processes of
cerebral arterial smooth muscle cells rely on the entry of
calcium ions into the cells.  xxxd2728xxx  crosses the bloodbrain barrier and it blocks the influx of extracellular calcium,
which is necessary for the contraction of large cerebral
arteries and thus,  xxxd2728xxx  selectively increases cerebral
blood flow and reverses the cerebral vasospasm without
altering the cerebral oxidative metabolism5). it is thought to
also have a neuroprotective effect by preventing calcium
overload in ischemic neurons. oral and intravenous  xxxd2728xxx  has been widely used for treating cerebral vasospasm
to achieve these effects. when it is administered intravenously, it may be associated with a few minor complications such as hypotension or arrhythmia23,24).
infusing intraarterial  xxxd2728xxx  in patients with symptomatic vasospasm has been reported on by several authors.
two early clinical studies have presented conflicting results3,8). boker et al.3) reported on the use of selective intraarterial  xxxd2728xxx  infusion for treating three patients with

vasospasm following aneurysmal sah, and they concluded
that intraarterial  xxxd2728xxx  was angiographically effective.
grotenhuis et al.8) treated six patients with intraarterial
 xxxd2728xxx  (0.068-1 mg); however, the treatment was
ineffective when administered after the onset of vasospasm. another experimental study demonstrated the
efficacy of selective intraarterial  xxxd2728xxx  administration
in a sah rabbit model at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg6).
two other groups have recently reported their clinical
findings regarding the use of intraarterial  xxxd2728xxx  to
treat the cerebral vasospasm caused by aneurysmal sah. in
both studies, intraarterial  xxxd2728xxx  led to a significant
improvement in the vessels’ diameters and the clinical status
of the patients with cerebral vasospasm and who had not
responded to previous medical therapy2,10).
intraarterial papaverine infusion produce crystal embolization. a super-selection of the area where a vasospasm was
present and thereby the administration site was minimized.
in particular, a special attention should be paid to the
ophthalmic artery whose blood flow rate is relatively slow.
intraarterial papaverine can therefore be infused into the
aca and mca simultaneously by placing the microcatheter tip into the supraclinoid segment of the ica just
above the ophthalmic artery branch point11). unlike intraarterial papaverine infusion, intraarterial  xxxd2728xxx  infusion does not produce a crystal embolization. thus, in this
procedure, selection of the ophthalmic artery is not necessary. a super-selection of the distal ica where a vasospasm
is present is also unnecessary.
according to our results, an intraarterial  xxxd2728xxx 
infusion significantly improved the vessel diameter in
patients with severe cerebral vasospasm who were refractory
to the medical treatments. besides, relatively good clinical
outcomes were also obtained. there were no persistent,
fatal complications associated with the procedure. although
one patient was in a vegetative state at discharge, this
patient already had a mental deterioration prior to the
procedure.
conclusion
from our data, the use of intraarterial  xxxd2728xxx  was
effective and safe in selected cases of vasospasm that
followed aneurysmal sah. prospective, randomized studies
are needed for evaluating the cerebral blood flow to
confirm our results. additional investigation is also needed
into novel techniques and procedures to improve the
cerebral blood flow and the clinical outcomes of the patients who display vasospasm after suffering an aneurismal
sah.
