abstract
neurotrophins and other neurotrophic factors have been shown to support the survival and differentiation of many neuronal
populations of the central and peripheral nervous system. therefore, administering neurotrophic factors could represent an alternative
strategy for the treatment of acute and chronic brain disorders. however, the delivery of neurotrophic factors to the brain is one of the
largest obstacles in the development of effective therapy for neurodegenerative disorders, because these proteins are not able to cross the
blood–brain barrier. the induction of growth factor synthesis in the brain tissue by systemically administered lipophilic drugs, such as
b-adrenoceptor agonists, shown to increase endogenous  xxxg1564xxx  žngf. synthesis in the brain, would be an elegant way to
overcome these problems of application. stimulation of b-adrenoceptors with clenbuterol led to increased ngf synthesis in cultured
central nervous system žcns. cells and rat brain tissue. clenbuterol-induced ngf expression was reduced to the control levels by
coadministration of b-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. furthermore, clenbuterol protected rat hippocampal neurons subjected to
excitotoxic damage. the neuroprotective effect of clenbuterol in vitro depended on increased ngf synthesis, since the neuroprotection
was abolished by ngf antisense oligonucleotide as well as by antibodies directed against ngf itself. in vivo, clenbuterol protected rat
hippocampus in a model of transient forebrain ischemia and reduced the infarct volume in a rat model of permanent middle cerebral
artery occlusion žmcao.. the neuroprotective effect of clenbuterol in vivo was accompanied by enhanced ngf synthesis in brain tissue.
these findings support our hypothesis that orally active ngf inducers may have a potential as therapeutic agents for the treatment of
neurodegenerative disorders and stroke. q 1999 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
the loss of neurons is responsible for many acute
neurological disorders as well as chronic neurodegenerative diseases. therefore, understanding the processes that
lead specifically to the death of neurons is critical for
developing pharmacological strategies to treat these disorders. several of the major mechanisms that have been
implicated in the pathogenesis of neuronal cell death are
under investigation.
the mechanism of ischemic injury has been elucidated
in studies with central nervous system žcns. neurons and
involves elevation of intracellular ca2q levels, overexcitation and generation of free radicals. therefore, many different agents, such as calcium antagonists,  xxxg981xxx  antagonists and free radical scavengers, have been
proposed for the treatment of stroke. however, all the
drugs used until now for stroke therapy were not convincingly successful and we have to look for other therapeutic
strategies. administering neurotrophic factors could represent such an alternative strategy for the treatment of acute
and chronic brain disorders. withdrawal of growth factors
generally leads to apoptotic death of neurons. the decrease
in trophic support for the neurons in aging brain is associated with neuronal death and appearance of neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer’s disease, parkinson’s
disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis which are characterized by a progressive loss of neuronal elements. this
cell loss may be prevented by a directed delivery of
neurotrophic factors. additionally, numerous studies have
demonstrated that neurotrophic factors can protect neurons
under acute injury conditions. therefore, another potential
therapeutic strategy has to be applied to provide trophic
support for neurons. the neurotrophic factors are polypeptides that interact with specific cellular receptors leading to biological responses, including proliferation, differentiation, changes in cell motility, cell structure, and
general cellular phenotype. many neurotrophic factors are
expressed in the cns. they show specific patterns of
distribution during development and can influence selected
neuronal populations in the cns through adulthood. the
‘‘classic’’  xxxg1614xxx  is ngf and there is abundant literature describing its physiological functions and its
neuroprotective effects. other members of the  xxxg259xxx  family, i.e., brain-derived  xxxg1614xxx 
žbdnf. and neurotrophins 3 and 4r5 žnt-3, nt-4r5.
exert neuroprotective effects. furthermore, acidic and  xxxg787xxx  žafgf,  xxxg787xxx ., ciliary  xxxg1614xxx  žcntf., transforming growth factors b
žtgf-b ., glial-derived  xxxg1614xxx  žgdnf. and

insulin-like growth factors žigfs. were also shown to have
a neuroprotective potency. it has been shown that administration of neurotrophic substances prevents lesion-induced
degeneration of specific neuronal pathways. for example,
cntf can prevent the degeneration of facial motoneurons
in the developing mouse w113x. basic fgf and ngf are
effective in rescuing cholinergic neurons after fimbria–fornix transection w2,131x. such neuroprotective activity is
observed in different models of excitotoxicity, suggesting
that neurotrophic factors may prevent ischemia- or
trauma-induced neurodegeneration.

2. protective activity of neurotrophic factors against
r ischemic damage
excitotoxicr
2.1. fgfs
direct infusion of acidic fgf into the hippocampus
reduces the severity of the ischemic insult and the extent
of neuronal loss w90x. in the presence of basic fgf, there
was significant reduction in neuronal death of cultured
hippocampal neurons caused by a high concentration of
glutamate w81,83x. the suppression of the expression of a
71 kda nmda-receptor protein by  xxxg787xxx  seems to be
involved in the mechanism of neuroprotective action. another interesting effect of fgfs is the stimulation of ngf
synthesis demonstrated in cultured mouse astrocytes w92x
and in neocortex of adult animals w30x.
2.2. cntf
it has been shown that cntf is highly expressed in
primary cultures of astrocytes w69,100x. cntf has been
characterized as a nonsecreted cytosolic molecule which
lacks a signal peptide sequence and seems to be released
from the cntf-producing cells after damage only w121x.
therefore, cntf has been described not as a target-derived factor, but as an injury-related protein and survivalpromoting agent after injury. it has been shown that cntf
attenuates axotomy-induced neuronal degeneration w113x
and promotes the survival of neonatal rat corticospinal
neurons w77x and cerebellar purkinje cells in vitro w65x. we
have demonstrated that exogenous human recombinant
cntf protects rat hippocampal neurons against
glutamate-induced excitotoxic damage in vitro žsemkova
et al., in press.. the effect was pronounced and appeared
at picomolar concentrations of cntf. additionally, cntf
was able to induce ngf synthesis in cultured hippocampal
cells and astrocyte cultures obtained from postnatal rat

cerebral cortex. since it is highly expressed in the lesioned
brain, cntf may upregulate ngf also in vivo, and this
upregulation could contribute to its neuroprotective activity.
2.3. tgf-b 1
the tgf-bžs. represent a family of multifunctional
peptide growth factors with several molecular weight
forms. tgf-b1 appears to be the most abundant form. the
actions of tgf-b1 are critically dependent on the cell type
and the state of differentiation. tgf-b1 is minimally
expressed in the intact brain, but its expression increases
strongly after trauma, excitotoxicity, and ischemia w60,62x,
suggesting that tgf-b1 plays a role in neuronal injury and
neuronal plasticity. we have previously shown that exogenous tgf-b1 prevents excitotoxic neuronal injury in rat
neocortical cultures w96x. the neuronal damage was induced by exposure to 1 mm glutamate and the cells were
treated with tgf-b1 immediately after the addition of
glutamate. in vivo, tgf-b1 ž1 mgrkg, i.c.v.. was able to
reduce the area of ischemia after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion žmcao. in mice w96x. we also investigated the neuroprotective potency of tgf-b1 in a rat
model of transient forebrain ischemia and demonstrated
that tgf-b1 at very low dosages has the capacity to
reduce the injury of ca1 hippocampal neurons w53x. this
indicates that tgf-b1 has the function of an endogenous
neuroprotectant, a function that might be used therapeutically in the treatment of ischemic and neurodegenerative
diseases of the mammalian cns. additionally, tgf-b1
might exert its biological actions by interfering with the
expression of other growth factors since it has been shown
that in cultured astrocytes tgf-b1 stimulates the expression of ngf, an effect that was also observed in rat brain
in vivo w72x.
2.4. ngf
in the cns, ngf exerts neurotrophic actions on the
cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain w49,129x and
protects them against axotomy-induced neurodegeneration
and aged-related atrophy w51x but the effects of ngf are
not restricted to these neuronal populations w117x. recently, it has been shown that ngf can prevent the
metabolic or excitotoxic injury of cultured hippocampal
and cortical neurons w82,119x. we have also demonstrated
that exogenous ngf can protect cultured hippocampal
neurons from excitotoxic damage induced by a high concentration of glutamate w112x. it is well known that hippocampal neurons are especially vulnerable to different
kinds of damage including ischemic and traumatic damage
to the cns. the exposure of hippocampal cultures to 1
mm glutamate for 1 h induced, pronounced neurodegeneration characterized by a decreased number of neurites and
loss of membrane integrity as evaluated 18 h after exposure to this neurotoxin. ngf reduced significantly the
number of damaged hippocampal neurons and preserved

the cell morphology w112x. our results are in agreement
with the previously reported neuroprotective activity of
ngf in cultured hippocampal neurons against hypoglycemia, excitotoxicity and iron-induced degeneration
w20,82,141x. the exact mechanism by which ngf protected hippocampal neurons against excitotoxic injury is
not clear since hippocampal neurons do not express trka,
the high affinity receptor for ngf w58x. on the other hand,
the expression of the low affinity receptor for ngf and
other neurotrophins žp75 ntr . has been demonstrated in the
hippocampal formation after transient ischemia w68x or
environmental damage w134x. recent data indicate that
p75 ntr is also capable of autonomous signaling via  xxxg259xxx -dependent activation of sphingomyelinase activity and nuclear factor nfk b transcriptional complexes
w18,27,106x. as a result, an increased activity of antioxidant enzymes such as manganese superoxide dismutase
has been reported w80,130x. therefore, the activation of this
signal transduction pathway may trigger neuroprotective
stimuli. in line with this hypothesis, it has been shown that
activation of nfk b in several cell types blocks apoptotic
cell death due to a variety of insults w8,73,125x. however,
the role of p75 ntr in mediating ngf-signaling is not well
clarified. casaccia-bonnefil at al. w19x found that rat oligodendrocytes, which express p75 ntr , but not trka, undergo
apoptosis in response to ngf. these findings contrast to
the report of ladiwala et al. w64x which indicate that
ngf-induced nuclear translocation of nfk b, mediated via
p75 ntr , did not induce cell death and may indicate a role
for nfk b in preventing apoptosis in human mature oligodendrocytes. in vivo, it has been reported that p75 ntr is
present in a very small amount in the hippocampus, but it
is induced in hippocampal neurons after transient ischemia
w68x. additionally, the neurons surviving transient ischemia
highly expressed p75 ntr , suggesting that this receptor
could contribute to the protective effect of ngf against
damage. in addition, agents capable of activating nfk b
such as c2-ceramide mimicked the rescuing effect of ngf
and  xxxg2296xxx  in hippocampal cultures w18,80,123x. however,
further studies are required to clarify the role of p75 ntr
receptor in mediating biological responses to ngf.
in vivo, ngf ameliorates neuronal degeneration in rat
cerebral cortex and hippocampus after ischemic insults
w13,118x. ngf producing fibroblasts were capable of protecting hippocampal neurons from ischemic insult w95x.
these data indicate that ngf possesses protective functions in these brain regions žhippocampus and cortex.
which are particularly vulnerable to cerebral ischemia and
chronic neurodegenerative disorders, such as alzheimer’s
disease.
therefore, the neurotrophic factors žespecially ngf.
are of interest as neuroprotective agents. however, the
therapeutical administration of these compounds seems to
be quite complicated because of their chemical properties.
neurotrophic factors are large protein molecules that cannot easily pass the blood brain barrier and do not distribute

i. semkoõa, j. krieglsteinr brain research reõiews 30 (1999) 176–188

properly after systemic administration. one approach to
enhance the amounts of neurotrophic factors available to
the cns is to stimulate their synthesis in affected brain
regions by systemically administered lipophilic compounds
with a low molecular weight. it is therefore of importance
to obtain detailed information regarding the mechanisms
that control the synthesis of neurotrophic factors within the
brain.
3. regulation of ngf synthesis in the brain
under physiological conditions, ngf mrna and protein are expressed by cns neurons, with high levels found
in the hippocampus, cortex and olfactory bulb, and comparatively low levels in the striatum and cerebellum
w61,127x. the highest level of expression was observed in
the hippocampus, in particular in subfields ca3, followed
by ca1 and ca2 and the granular layer of the dentate
gyrus w4x. however, the hippocampal and cortical ngf
protein levels increase after fimbria–fornix transection in
adult rodent w41,59x. furthermore, hypoxic–ischemic injury w74x, neurotoxin administration w56,136, xxxd404xxx  and excitotoxic lesions w89,122x also caused changes in brain ngf
levels. additionally, elevated ngf levels have been reported after seizures w28,67x and brain trauma w26x. this
indicates that increased ngf expression žsynthesis. after
injury to the cns is probably an endogenous protective
mechanism to maintain neuronal survival in lesioned brain
regions. therefore, by manipulating endogenous regulation
systems, the expression of ngf protein after cns damage
might be sustained or even elevated. thus, induction of
ngf by pharmacological intervention during the critical
period of injury may reduce the extent of neuronal damage
after acute events such as stroke and trauma and may have
therapeutic benefits for alzheimer’s disease. therefore,
understanding the mechanisms which control ngf synthesis in the brain is of great interest. several drugs have been
reported to upregulate ngf synthesis in different cell
culture models or in brain tissue žsee refs. w17,63,85,104x..
however, it seems that several ngf-inducing agents act
on different cell types žneurons or glial cells. through
different pathways showing the complexicity of ngf regulation. the expression of neuronal ngf mrna is known
to be regulated by glutamatergic and gaba-ergic activity
in vivo and in vitro. whereas  xxxg981xxx  stimulation increases ngf mrna levels, gaba-ergic activity
decreases ngf mrna levels w38,46,98,102,138,139x. it
has been suggested that cholinergic activity may stimulate
ngf and bdnf synthesis w22,70,136x. studies on hippocampal and cortical neurons in vitro have shown that
increased ngf mrna levels can be induced by kcl
depolarization, kainic acid, glutamate, and ca2q w76,138x.
on the other hand, not only neurons but also glial cells can
produce ngf. in vitro studies have shown that astrocytes
synthesize and secrete ngf into the culture medium
w36,55,76,100,133x. however, while astrocytes cultured in

179

a serum-free medium produced small amounts of ngf, the
presence of serum resulted in a dramatic enhancement of
the levels of ngf mrna and mature protein w16x. furthermore, except for the camp-signaling pathway w108x, two
other general mechanisms appear to promote expression of
the ngf gene in astrocytes. the first one operates through
the activation of pkc, and is triggered by serum, diacylglycerol and b- xxxd2925xxx  žpma. w24,87x. the other one
acts through the sphingomyelin pathway, and is thought to
be activated by  xxxd1682xxx , il-1b, lipopolysaccharide and
ceramide w39,40,97x. additionally, it has been shown that
activation of these second messenger pathways, modulates
important astrocytic features such as gap junction communication w42x and cell shape w29,48,84x. furthermore, the
synthesis of ngf in glial cells has been reported to be
positively regulated by  xxxd3417xxx  w132x, 4-alkylcatechols
w35x and thyroid hormones w11x. various cytokines such as
il-1b, if-b and trophic factors žbfgf, tgf-b1. have also
been shown to upregulate ngf synthesis within the cns
w12,30,37,72,120,135x. therefore, different substances including a variety of growth factors and cytokines may
increase ngf and its mrna expression by distinct mechanisms. the transcriptional mechanisms involved in the
regulation of the ngf gene are still largely unknown since
only one regulatory element, an ap-1 consensus sequence
located in the first exon of the ngf gene, has been fully
characterized w25,52x. ngf gene expression was correlated
with that of several protooncogenes encoding proteins of
the fos and jun families. the induction of c-fos and c-jun
genes and their subsequent interaction with the ap-1 site
of ngf promoter may represent an important pathway in
the activation of the ngf gene w86,93,139x.
the question about the exact cellular localization of
ngf synthesis under normal and pathological conditions
also remains open. many studies revealed that expression
of ngf and other neurotrophic substances under physiological conditions is almost completely neuronal w6,38,67x.
however, this situation changes dramatically following
brain injury. gliosis is a common injury response of the
cns. reactive astrocytes are capable of expressing ngf
w71,76,135x, cntf w5,58x and  xxxg787xxx  w32x. glial-derived
ngf has been suggested to be responsible for increased
ngf protein levels within the brain after injury. arendt et
al. w4x reported that the expression of ngf gene in vivo
was localized predominantly in astrocytes after damage
caused by cholinergic cortical deafferentation. they suggest that the compensatory upregulation of ngf gene
expression is largely related to a reactive gliosis in response to injury and neurodegeneration within the cns.
furthermore, astrocytes are capable of expressing mrna
for the receptor proteins p75 ntr , trka and trkb which
are upregulated in response to ngf and brain injury w57x.
this suggests that ngf might act on astrocytes as part of
autocrine cascades associated with glia–glia and glia–neuron interactions, which are of importance for neuronal
maintenance and repair. since activated astrocytes are

180

i. semkoõa, j. krieglsteinr brain research reõiews 30 (1999) 176–188

capable of expressing ngf and other neurotrophic substances, the process of reactive gliosis might be related to
the regenerative outcome following cns injury. the
molecular signals which trigger the transformation of normal into reactive astrocytes remain undefined, but there is
increasing evidence that certain neurotransmitters w79,115x
and cytokines w44x can modulate astrocyte proliferation
under physiological as well as pathological circumstances.
when brain astrocytes are activated in vivo by lesions, or
by il-1b, they secrete ngf as demonstrated by doublelabel immunohistochemistry w7,91x. furthermore, it has
been shown that il-1b secreted by activated brain microglia is a potent activator of ngf secretion from astrocytes w14,43x. the potential for glial cells to express neurotrophic factors in vivo has led to the hypothesis that
astrocytes in vivo may be capable of supplying the neurons
with appropriate factors necessary for their survival and
maintenance. it raises a number of interesting questions. is
it possible to further enhance pharmacologically the expression of neurotrophic factors by activated astrocytes
after ischemic or traumatic damage to the cns? what is
the role of activated macrophages in regulating the expression of neurotrophic factors from astrocytes? how can
these neurotrophic factors, synthesized and released from
activated astrocytes, influence neuronal survival?

4. b-adrenoceptor-mediated control of ngf production: implications for neuroprotection?
4.1. in õitro eõidence
there is evidence that b-adrenergic receptors are expressed by astrocytes in vitro as well as by astrocytes in
many cns areas in vivo w54,79x. the activation of these
receptors on cultured astrocytes can modulate a wide range
of astrocyte functions such as expression of early response
genes w3x, alteration in glial cell morphology w54x, synthesis
and release of cytokines w78x and neurotrophic substances
such as ngf w108x.  xxxd1773xxx  analogs and agents that
increase the intracellular concentration of camp have been
reported to induce differentiation in astrocytes, i.e., morphological changes that include conversion from flat cells
to multiple process-bearing cells, as well as increases in
the production of gfap mrna and protein w1,45x, bdnf
mrna w139x and truncated trkb w21x and a decrease in
cntf mrna and protein w15,101x.
astrocytes in culture synthesize ngf w36,55x. the ngf
secretion was affected by serum and cell density. serum
itself has been shown to induce ngf synthesisrsecretion
w16x. as the cell density became lower, greater amounts of
ngf were secreted irrespective of the presence of serum
w55x. b-adrenergic receptor activation was shown to be
one way to stimulate endogenous ngf synthesis in cultured glial cells as well as in brain tissue in vivo. it has
been shown that the stimulation of b-adrenergic receptors

with  xxxd2401xxx  increased the ngf gene expression in
cultured astrocytes and astrocytoma cells within a few
hours via a mechanism associated with accumulation of
intracellular camp and activation of camp-dependent
 xxxg1836xxx  w16,23,34,86,107,109x. the chain of events
that result in increased production of ngf following badrenergic receptor stimulation has been investigated in
the c6-2b rat astrocytoma cell line w86x. exposure of these
cells to the b-agonist  xxxd2401xxx  elicits the following
cascade of events: ž1. increase in camp content; ž2.
increase in c-fos mrna content; ž3. accumulation of
c-fos protein; ž4. increase in ngf mrna content. the
increase in the two messages žfor c-fos and ngf. appears
interrelated because cycloheximide inhibits the accumulation of c-fos protein and ngf mrna elicited by  xxxd2401xxx  w86x. however, the role of camp and protein kinase
a pathway in ngf regulation by astroglial cells is still not
clearly defined. depending on the cell culture conditions,
the growth state of the cells and the experimental model,
different results have been obtained w47x. whether the
b-adrenergic receptor regulation of ngf is mediated via
camp has been a matter of debate, because one report
showed replication of the  xxxd2401xxx  effects with
 xxxd1742xxx  w108x, whereas another laboratory has seen variable results apparently serum dependent w120,140x. however, under our experimental conditions  xxxd2398xxx  was
also able to induce ngf synthesis in cultured astrocytes
w111x.  xxxd1742xxx , db camp and 8-br camp increased ngf
protein content in the same cultures žhuhne
et al., in
¨
preparation.. the increase in ngf protein content ž1.5-fold
to twofold. measured in the culture medium was accompanied with morphological changes typical for ‘‘differentiated’’ type astrocytes which express neurite-like processes
and increased gfap immunoreactivity žfig. 1a,b.. the
camp-dependent changes in astrocytic shape and gfap
have been described previously w45x. furthermore, we have
found that clenbuterol, a lipophilic b-adrenergic receptor
agonist, induces concentration-dependently ngf synthesis
in cultured rat cortical astrocytes prepared from cerebral
cortices of postnatal rats. the stimulation of b-adrenergic
receptors with clenbuterol increased not only ngf mrna
but also ngf protein secreted into the culture medium
žfig. 2.. the effect seems to be mediated via activation of
b-adrenergic receptors expressed in moderate to high levels by astrocytes since it was completely blocked by
propranolol, a nonselective b-adrenoceptor antagonist. additionally, we have previously shown that clenbuterol increases ngf synthesis in hippocampal cultures obtained
from postnatal rats žpd 1. which contain both astrocytes
and neurons w112x. unstimulated hippocampal cells release
detectable amounts of ngf žngf-elisa, determination
limit 3.95 pgrml. into the medium, which were increased
significantly after incubation with clenbuterol. whether
this drug induces ngf synthesis in hippocampal astrocytes
or neurons remains to be clarified. on the other hand,
neuronal–glial interactions also play an important role in

4.2. in õiõo eõidence
the stimulation of b-adrenergic receptors in astrocytes
leads to increased astrogliosis that contributes to scar
formation in lesioned brain tissue w54x. additionally, reac-

tive astrocyte formation, as reflected in increased gfapimmunoreactivity, is greatly reduced in vivo by treatment
with b-adrenergic receptor antagonists, suggesting that
adrenergic innervation can control astrocyte reactivity following injury. activated astrocytes have been widely discussed as a possible source of neuroprotective factors that
support neuronal survival under lesioning conditions

hypothesis, in-situ hybridization revealed an enhanced expression of gfap mrna 6 h after the onset of ischemia
in clenbuterol treated animals compared to the controls
žculmsee et al., submitted.. therefore, the modification of
astrocyte functions by b-adrenergic agonists could be therapeutically useful.

induction of ngf
fig. 2. clenbuterol enhances ngf protein content in the medium from rat

tion of cytokine expression in glial cells by so-called
astrocyte-kinetic drugs could become a new therapeutic
strategy for neurodegenerative diseases w10,54,76x. therefore, the stimulation of b-adrenoceptors on astrocytes by
systemically administered drugs can further increase the
process of reactive gliosis after damage and might improve
neuronal outcome by enhanced synthesis and release of
neurotrophic factors from the astrocytes.
in a line with this hypothesis, follesa and mocchetti
w31x tried to find out whether systemically administered
b-adrenoceptor agonist clenbuterol can increase ngf and
 xxxg787xxx  synthesis in intact rat brain. clenbuterol elicited a
rapid increase in ngf and  xxxg787xxx  message and protein in
the rat cerebral cortex w31,50x. in line with these results,
we have found that clenbuterol systemically administered
to long–evans rats enhanced the level of ngf mrna in
cerebral cortex and hippocampus. the enhancement of
ngf message in these brain regions was followed by a
corresponding increase in ngf protein w110x. the question
is, which cells in brain tissue release ngf after stimulation
of b-adrenoceptors. most of the b-adrenergic receptors in
the brain are located on astrocytes w115x. on the other
hand, a number of in vivo studies have indicated that ngf
gene expression under physiological conditions was expressed by neurons w6,28,66,128x. however, this situation
changes dramatically following brain injury. traumatic
injury to the adult mammalian cns leads to a well-documented reactive gliosis w9x with reactive astrocytes capable
of expressing ngf w4,68,76,135x and other neurotrophic
substances. astrocytes have been widely discussed as a
possible source of neuroprotective factors that support
neuronal survival under damage w76,99x. astrocytes express b2-adrenergic receptors w79,105,116x. furthermore,
it has been shown that b 2-adrenergic receptors are upregulated on astrocytes in vivo after lesions w79,114x. it suggests that stimulation of these receptors can further increase astrocyte activity and can modulate their pattern of
cytokine and growth factors expression. in line with this

although there is some information on the induction of
growth factors by drugs, little is known about the neuroprotective potency of this approach. as reported previously, the b2-adrenergic drug clenbuterol has been shown
to increase ngf synthesis in hippocampal cultures w112x.
therefore, we tried to find out whether clenbuterol could
protect cultured hippocampal neurons from excitotoxic
damage by stimulation of ngf synthesis. we found that
this drug reduced significantly the number of damaged
neurons and preserved cell morphology in a similar way as
ngf. the neuroprotective activity of clenbuterol was
shown at the same concentration range which increased the
ngf content in the culture medium, suggesting a relationship between ngf induction and neuroprotection w112x.
similarly, the neuroprotective activity of clenbuterol was
completely blocked by coadministration of monoclonal
anti-ngf antibodies w112x, demonstrating that the neuronal
rescue is mediated by ngf. this is the first evidence to
our knowledge clearly demonstrating that pharmacologically induced ngf can cause neuroprotection. the stimulation of ngf synthesis by clenbuterol in hippocampal
cultures seemed to be mediated via activation of b-adrenergic receptors expressed on hippocampal cells since the
neuroprotective activity of this drug was abolished by
propranolol w112x. it has been shown that b-adrenergic
receptors are present in the hippocampus w94x but mainly
glial cells express the b 2-subtype w79x, suggesting that
astrocytes synthesize and secrete ngf in response to
b-stimulation. however, the cell type responsible for the
increased ngf concentration measured in the culture
medium after exposure to clenbuterol and the role of
neuronal–glial interactions in response to b-adrenergic
stimulation remains to be determined. furthermore, we
tried to find out whether the neuroprotective activity of
clenbuterol against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity could
be blocked by antisense-mediated ngf knock down. for
this purpose, we used a ngf antisense oligodeoxynucleotide žodn. complementary to the binding site between
the intron and exon 3 of the ngf pre-mrna vs. a random
control odn, which had no complementarity with the
ngf mrna, but the same base composition as the antisense odn. first, we tested the ability of ngf antisense
to block ngf synthesis in primary astrocyte cultures.

ž0.3–1 mm. for 3 h reduced the concentration of ngf in
the culture medium concentration-dependently žfig. 3a..

183

furthermore, the neuroprotective activity of clenbuterol in
hippocampal cultures was completely abolished by pretreatment with ngf antisense odn žfig. 3c.. ngf antisense or random odn alone did not influence neuronal
survival žfig. 3b.. this indicates that the neurorescuing
effect of clenbuterol in hippocampal cultures is mediated
via ngf since ngf blocking antibodies as well as the
suppression of ngf synthesis by ngf antisense odn
completely abolished the neuroprotective activity of this
drug.

a number of in vivo studies demonstrate that ngf can
rescue cns neurons from excitotoxic damage. it has been
shown that exogenous ngf protected rat hippocampus
against ischemic insult w13,118x and attenuated excitatory
amino acid toxicity in rat striatum w33x. recently, it has
been reported that fibroblasts, genetically modified to produce ngf, protected rat hippocampal neurons against
ischemic insult when they were implanted into hippocampal brain regions before ischemia w95x. however, all these
approaches to deliver ngf into the brain with the purpose
to protect cns neurons from injury are associated with
major difficulties like surgery, insufficient distribution and,
consequently, the application of very high dosages of
ngf. a very elegant way to enhance the amounts of ngf
within the cns could be the induction of endogenous
ngf synthesis by lipophilic substances which easily cross
the blood–brain barrier. the first experiments, where
ngf-inducing drugs were used to protect brain tissue from
injury in vivo, showed very promising results. we have
reported that clenbuterol systemically administered ameliorates neuronal damage in the ca1 subfield of the hippocampus in a rat model of transient forebrain ischemia
w112,142x. these results are supported by rudge et al.
w103x who reported that clenbuterol attenuated neuronal
loss induced by systemic injection of kainic acid. the
neuroprotection observed in vivo could be mediated by
ngf since clenbuterol enhanced ngf expression in rat
brain w31,50x. ngf is normally synthesized in the dentate
gyrus granule cells and in the ca1 subfield of the adult rat
hippocampus w128x. the dentate gyrus and the ca1–ca3
subfields of the rat hippocampus have been described to be
densely innervated by noradrenergic neurons w75x, suggesting that the synthesis of ngf may occur under elevated
noradrenergic tone. clenbuterol was also shown to protect
brain tissue against ischemic damage in a model of focal
cerebral ischemia w124x performed in mice and rats w112x.
fig. 4 shows that a single intraperitoneal injection of
clenbuterol before permanent mcao in long–evans rats
leads to a reduction of the cortical infarct volume measured 7 days after ischemia. these data suggest that the

fig. 4. clenbuterol reduces the infarct volume in a rat model of permanent focal cerebral ischemia. clenbuterol was administered intraperitoneally to long–evans rats 3 h before permanent occlusion of the
middle cerebral artery. seven days after the surgical procedure, brains
were removed and coronal slices were taken every 0.5 mm. the sections
were stained with 0.5% cresyl violet. the infarct volume was calculated
from the infarct area of each section and the distance between succeeding
slices. values are means"s.d. of ns10 animals. statistics were performed by analysis of variance with subsequent duncan’s test. different
from control: uu p- 0.01, uuu p- 0.001. ža. clenbuterol ž0.01–0.1
mgrkg. reduces dose-dependently the infarct volume in a rat model of
permanent focal cerebral ischemia when administered 3 h before mcao.
žb. higher dosages of clenbuterol ž10 mgrkg. administered 3 h before
mcao fail to protect rat brain tissue from ischemic damage.

induction of ngf by pharmacological stimulation of b-receptors could be a strategy to protect neurons from degeneration in vivo, similar to the in vitro investigations
described above. as we have shown, pretreatment with
clenbuterol is necessary to protect brain tissue from ischemic damage while posttreatment was not protective in a
model of focal cerebral ischemia in mice w112x. this
suggests that the neuroprotective activity of clenbuterol
depends on the endogenous synthesis of ngf or other
neuroprotective growth factors like  xxxg787xxx  or tgf-b1. it
has been shown that there is a delayed time course in the
enhanced synthesis of both ngf and  xxxg787xxx  after stimulation w31,50x. although 10 mgrkg clenbuterol induced ngf
protein in rat brain w50x, this dose of clenbuterol did not
protect brain tissue from ischemic damage under our experimental conditions žfig. 4b.. a significant reduction of
blood pressure and an increase in blood glucose levels are
two side effects of the b-adrenergic drug which might be
the reason why high doses failed to show protective effects

in the model of focal cerebral ischemia. however, we have
shown that clenbuterol can induce ngf synthesis also at
lower doses ž0.1–0.5 mgrkg. w110x. the stimulation of
ngf synthesis was accompanied by a reduction of cortical
infarct volume after permanent mcao žfig. 4.. as previously demonstrated, the induction of ngf synthesis in the
rat brain tissue by clenbuterol is mediated by stimulation
of b 2-receptors. propranolol, a lipophilic b 2-receptor antagonist, which could easily cross the blood brain barrier
was reported to inhibit the induction of ngf synthesis by
clenbuterol. however,  xxxd2689xxx , a hydrophilic b2antagonist, which was only distributed outside the cns,
did not alter the effects of clenbuterol concerning the
induction of growth factor synthesis within the cns
w31,50x. these data correlate with our in vitro findings
described above, where we demonstrated that it was the
stimulation of b 2-receptors which led to the induction of
ngf. it has been suggested that neurons are the source of
enhanced ngf synthesis after stimulation of b-receptors
by clenbuterol w31x. this might be true under physiological
conditions. moreover, the situation is totally different in
lesioned brain tissue as, for example, after ischemia when
astrocytes and microglial cells are activated and their
pattern of cytokine expression has changed. astrocytes
expressing b-receptors have been found in many cns
areas. these data are in line with the phenomenon of
clenbuterol mediated ngf induction in different brain
regions like cortex and hippocampus as well as cerebellum
w50x. however, the source of pharmacologically induced
ngf synthesis in brain tissue either under physiological or
pathophysiological conditions remains to be determined.

7. conclusion
we have shown that pharmacological stimulation of
b-adrenoceptors in cultured cns cells and rat brain tissue
leads to increased ngf synthesis. the reduction of ngf
synthesis to control levels after coadministration of clenbuterol and the b-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol indicates a key role for b-receptors in the mechanism of
clenbuterol-mediated ngf induction. furthermore, the
neuroprotective activity of clenbuterol in vitro depends on
increased ngf synthesis, since the neuroprotection is abolished by ngf-antisense oligonucleotide as well as by
antibodies against ngf itself. the widespread expression
of b2-adrenoceptors and their upregulation in astrocytes
after brain injury suggests an important role of b-adrenoceptor dependent pathways in the mechanisms of cell death.
in vivo, the neuroprotective effect of clenbuterol against
ischemic damage is accompanied by enhanced ngf synthesis. these findings support our hypothesis that orally
active ngf inducers may have a potential as therapeutic
agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and
stroke.
