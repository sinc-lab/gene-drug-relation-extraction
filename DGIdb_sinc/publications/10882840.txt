the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists, clonidine,
 xxxd2500xxx  and  xxxd2241xxx , blocked stress- but not cocaineinduced reinstatement of cocaine seeking at doses that
suppressed footshock-induced release of noradrenaline in
prefrontal cortex and amygdala. rats were trained to selfadminister cocaine (0.5 mg/kg/infusion, i.v; 10–12 days) and,
after a drug-free period (7–13 days), were returned to the selfadministration chambers for daily extinction and
reinstatement test sessions. both intermittent footshock (15
min, 0.6 ma) and cocaine priming (20 mg/kg, i.p.) reinstated
extinguished drug seeking. pretreatment with either

clonidine (20, or 40 ␮g/kg, i.p.) or  xxxd2500xxx  (50, 100, 150, or
200 ␮g/kg, i.p.) attenuated footshock- but not cocaineinduced reinstatement of cocaine seeking.  xxxd2241xxx  (640
␮g/kg, i.p.), an alpha-2 agonist with low affinity for
imidazoline type-1 receptors, also attenuated footshock- but
not cocaine-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. the
results point to an important role for ne systems in the
effects of footshock on relapse to cocaine seeking.

key words:

stress provoked craving for drug in cocaine addicts. using an animal model of stress-induced relapse, we and
others have found in rats that exposure to brief intermittent footshock stress reliably reinstates heroin seeking (shaham and stewart 1995), cocaine seeking (erb et
al. 1996; ahmed and koob 1997; mantsch and goeders
1999), nicotine seeking (buczek et al. 1999), and alcohol
seeking (lê et al. 1998).
in a search for neurotransmitter systems involved in
stress-induced relapse, and for pharmacological manipulations that might prevent it, we explored in the
present set of experiments the role of the noradrenergic
(ne) system, comprised of a dorsal stream of neurons
originating in the locus-coeruleus and a ventral stream
of neurons originating in the lateral tegmental nuclei
(aston-jones et al. 1995; moore and bloom 1979). although the stress-related functions of the ventral projections have been only partially characterized (cole
and robbins 1987; hansen et al. 1980), ne projections
from the lc have been directly implicated in a number

to be important to relapse in humans is stress (kreek
and koob 1998). in a recent laboratory study, sinha and

of stress-related responses. for example, electrical stimulation of the lc has been found to induce anxiety and
to result in activation of the autonomic nervous system,
whereas local injections of the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine, which acts to inhibit ne cell firing
(aghajanian and vandermaelen 1982) and release
(carter 1997), has been found to decrease physiological
and behavioral responses to stressors (bremner et al.
1996; redmond and huang 1979).
we have recently reported that systemic or intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of clonidine block footshock-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking (shaham et al. 2000), a finding that suggests an important
role for brain ne in the mediation of stress-induced relapse. in previous studies, we have shown that another
neurotransmitter system,  xxxg517xxx 
(crf), also plays an important role in mediating the
footshock-induced reinstatement of both cocaine (erb et
al. 1998; erb and stewart 1999) and heroin seeking (shaham et al. 1997) via its actions at extrahypothalamic brain
sites. interestingly, the crf and ne systems interact in
the brain in the modulation of stress responses (e.g., li et
al. 1998; shimizu et al. 1994; smagin et al. 1997; valentino
et al. 1991; valentino and wehby 1988), raising the possibility that an interaction between these systems underlies
stress-induced relapse to drug seeking.
the present set of experiments had four main objectives. first, we assessed whether the effect of clonidine
on stress-induced reinstatement previously observed in
heroin-trained rats would generalize to rats with a history of cocaine self-administration. second, we tested
whether another alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist,
 xxxd2500xxx , would be equally effective. third, because
clonidine is known to bind at high affinity to the imidazoline type-1 (i1) receptor, we studied the effect of an alpha-2
adrenergic receptor agonist with low affinity for the i1 receptor,  xxxd2241xxx  (piletz et al. 1994), on stress-induced
reinstatement. finally, we studied the effect of clonidine,
 xxxd2500xxx , and  xxxd2241xxx  on reinstatement of cocaine
seeking induced by a priming injection of cocaine.
before conducting the behavioral experiments, we
assessed the ability of the three alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists to suppress footshock-induced release
of ne in two terminal regions, the prefrontal cortex
(pfc) and amygdala (amg). the pfc is a major terminal region of the dorsal ne system arising from the locus coeruleus, whereas the amg receives input from
both the dorsal and ventral systems.

subjects. the subjects were male long-evans rats
(charles river, quebec) weighing 300–350 g at the be-

ginning of the experiment. throughout the experiment,
animals were housed in a humidity- and temperaturecontrolled colony room on a reversed light-dark schedule
(lights on 1730–0530 hours) and were given free access
to standard laboratory rat chow and water. the experimental procedures followed the ccac guidelines and
were approved by the animal care committee, concordia university.
surgery. before surgery, rats were anesthetized with
sodium pentobarbital (65 mg/kg, i.p.) and were injected with  xxxd247xxx  (0.6 mg/ml; 0.2 ml/rat, sc)
and antibiotic (penlong, rogar/stb inc.; 0.1 ml/rat,
i.m.). guide cannulae (20 gauge; plastics one) were implanted for subsequent insertion of dialysis probes; one
was placed in pfc and one in amg in opposite hemispheres. the animals used to study the effects of  xxxd2241xxx  received a single guide cannula aimed at pfc. the
hemisphere into which the respective guide cannulae
were implanted was counterbalanced across treatments. the stereotaxic coordinates used (relative to
bregma and skull surface) were as follows: amg, ap
⫺3.0 mm, ml ⫾ 4.5 mm, dv ⫺6.7 mm; pfc, ap ⫹ 3.2
mm, ml ⫾ 0.5 mm, dv ⫺1.5 mm (paxinos and watson
1997). upon insertion, the shaft of the dialysis probe extended 1 mm from the guide cannulae. implanted
guide cannulae were secured to the skull with stainless
steel screws and dental cement. guide cannulae were
closed with screw-in obdurators. all animals were returned to the colony room for a recovery period of no
less than 1 week prior to testing.
microdialysis. microdialysis was conducted in four
hexagonal testing chambers (42 ⫻ 39 ⫻ 33.5 cm) built
from plexiglas with wooden ceilings and stainless steel
rod floors. dark curtains were drawn around each
chamber and lighting was provided on a reversed cycle
by overhead light bulbs (15 w). the dialysis probe consisted of a 1.8 mm (amg) or 3.5 mm (pfc) length of
semipermeable dialysis membrane (spectra/por; 240
␮m o.d., 13000 m.w. cutoff), closed at one end and attached at the other to a 19 mm length of 26 gauge stainless-steel tubing. a 40- to 50-cm length of pe-20 tubing
connected the other end of the stainless steel shaft to an
infusion swivel stationed above the testing chamber that
was in turn connected via pe-20 tubing to a variablespeed infusion pump. a small diameter, fused-silica
tube extended internally through the probe, with one
end resting 0.5 mm from the tip of the probe and the
other end exiting the pe tubing 35 cm below the infusion
swivel. the external length of pe-20 tubing was protected from damage by steel spring casings. the probes
were designed so that the entire length of semi-permeable membrane extended below the guide cannula tip.
separate squads of animals were used to examine the
effects of each of the drugs tested. within each squad,
each animal was randomly assigned to the treatment

condition. animals that received vehicle injections were
run in each squad, but were combined into a single
group for statistical analysis. final group sizes (pfc/
amg) were as follows: vehicle (n ⫽ 15/17), clonidine
20 ␮g/kg (n ⫽ 7/6), clonidine 40 ␮g/kg (n ⫽ 9/5),
 xxxd2500xxx  75 ␮g/kg (n⫽6/6),  xxxd2500xxx  150 ␮g/kg (n ⫽
5/6),  xxxd2241xxx  640␮g/kg (n ⫽ 4, pfc). with the exception of the animals receiving  xxxd2241xxx , all subjects
were dialyzed twice, once in the pfc and once in the
amg with an interval of 3–4 weeks between tests.
the probes were inserted the day before the beginning of microdialysis testing. to prevent occlusion, artificial csf (145 mm na⫹, 2.7 mm k⫹, 1.22 mm ca2⫹,
1.0 mm mg2⫹, 150 mm cl-, 0.2 mm ascorbate, 2 mm
na2hpo4, ph 7.4 ⫾ 0.1) was perfused overnight at a
rate of 0.06 ␮l/min. dialysate sampling and activity
monitoring began the next morning. the dialysate flow
rate was increased to 0.6 ␮l/ min, and baseline dialysate samples (ⵑ12 ␮l/ sample) were collected every 20
min. samples were collected until a stable baseline, defined as a minimum of three consecutive samples in
which dialysate ne levels varied by ⫾10%, was
achieved. following the establishment of stable baseline
ne levels, all animals received an i.p. injection (1 ml/
kg) of the appropriate drug or vehicle which was given
40 min before a 10 min period of footshock. shocks were
delivered on a variable time schedule at a mean interval
of 40 seconds (10–70 seconds range); each shock (0.6 ma)
was 0.5 seconds in duration. samples were collected for
a further 120 minutes (6 samples). samples were immediately analyzed using one of two similar high-performance liquid chromatography systems with electrochemical detection (hplc-ec). the samples (10 ␮l)
were loaded onto reverse-phase columns (15 ⫻ 0.46 cm;
haisil c18, 5 ␮m; sci. products & equipment, concord,
ontario) through manual injection ports (reodyne
7125; 20 ␮l loop); reduction and oxidation currents for
ne, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (dopac), 5-hydoxyindoleacetic acid (5-hiaa) and homovanillic acid
(hva) were measured with dual-channel esa coulometric detectors (coulochem 5100, with a model 5021
conditioning cell and a model 5011 analytical cell, sci.
products & equipment). the currents for ne were measured independent of those for dopac and hva using
separate channels of the coulochem detectors. the mobile phases (sodium acetate 36 mm, sos 3.1 mm, edta
100 ␮m, 5% acetonitrile, adjusted to ph 3.7 using glacial acetic acid) were circulated through each closed
system at a flow rate of 1.4 ml/min by waters 510
hplc pumps. the peaks obtained for ne, dopac and
hva were integrated and quantified by ezchrom
chromatography data system (sci. products & equipment). dialysate samples from individual rats always
were analyzed with the same hplc-ec system, and the
assignment of animals to each system was counterbalanced across all treatment groups. food was removed

from the chambers before sampling, but a water drinking tube was available. at the completion of testing,
confirmation of correct probe placement was determined by examination of 30 ␮m sections cut through
the sites of probe placement stained with cresyl violet.

experiment 2: effects of clonidine on footshockand cocaine-induced reinstatement
subjects. the subjects were 25 male long-evans rats
(charles river, quebec) weighing 350–425 g at the start
of the experiment. the animals were maintained as described in experiment 1.
surgery. animals were prepared for surgery as described in experiment 1. an intravenous catheter (dow
corning) was implanted in the right jugular vein. a 3-cm
length of silastic tubing was inserted into the vein (inner diameter 0.30 mm, outer diameter 0.64 mm) and
was connected with heat shrink tubing to a 9-cm length
of silastic tubing (inner diameter 0.51 mm, outer diameter 0.94 mm) that was passed subcutaneously to the top
of the skull. the catheter was secured to the vein with
silk sutures and exited into a connector (a modified 22
gauge cannula; plastics one, roanoke, va) that was
mounted to the skull with jeweler’s screws and dental
cement; a plastic cap was placed over the opening of the
cannula. animals were allowed 1–2 weeks to recover
from surgery.
apparatus. the self-administration chambers used in
the experiments were equipped with a retractable lever
(med associates, st albans, vt) and a non-retractable
“dummy” lever. both levers were located 9 cm above
the floor. an infusion pump (razel scientific instruments, stamford, ct) was activated by responses on the
retractable, or “active,” lever. responses on the dummy
lever were recorded but did not result in activation of
the pump. drug solution was delivered over a 10-s period in a volume of 65 ␮l. throughout the infusion period, a white stimulus light just above the active lever
was illuminated and additional responses during this
time were recorded, but did not result in reactivation of
the pump. each self-administration chamber was fitted
to deliver constant-current, intermittent, inescapable,
electric footshock through a scrambler to the grid floor
(grason-stadler generator #e1064gs or med associates). the footshock was delivered for 15 min according
to a variable time schedule at a mean interval of 40 seconds (10–70 seconds range). each shock (0.6 ma) was
0.5 seconds in duration. this intensity of footshocks has
been found using our apparatus to be the minimal required to induce reliable reinstatement.
drugs. cocaine hcl was obtained from  xxxg257xxx  chemicals (toronto, canada) and was dissolved in physiological saline. clonidine hcl was purchased from sigma

neuropsychopharmacology 2000–vol. 23, no. 2

(st louis, mo) and was dissolved in physiological saline and injected i.p. (0, 20, and 40 ␮g/kg).
procedure. phase 1: training. rats were trained to selfadminister cocaine hcl (0.5 mg/kg/infusion, i.v.) on a
fixed-ratio-1 schedule of reinforcement during one
daily 3-h self-administration session. each day, half of
the animals were brought to the operant chambers for
their self-administration session in the morning, approximately three hours after lights off, and half of the
animals were brought to the chambers in the afternoon,
approximately seven hours after lights off. the group of
animals assigned to the morning and afternoon sessions
alternated daily so that by the end of training all animals had received an equal number of self-administration sessions at both times. it was important that all animals had similar experience self-administering early
and late in the day since during phase 2 all animals received extinction sessions in the morning followed by a
test session that typically occurred in the afternoon. at
the beginning of each session, a red house light was illuminated for 10 seconds before introduction of the retractable lever into the cage. the light just above the active lever was lit for the initial 30 seconds following
presentation of the lever. the house light remained illuminated throughout the session. as indicated previously, responses on the active lever resulted in activation of the infusion pump and illumination of the light
above the lever for the 10 seconds of drug delivery. additional lever presses during the drug-delivery period
were recorded but did not result in reactivation of the
pump. training conditions were in place for 10 to 12
days. at the end of training, animals were left undisturbed in the colony room for 7 to 13 days. subsequently, extinction and testing took place. in this experiment and in experiment 3b, groups of animals were
assigned to different doses of the test drugs. all animals
in each group were then subjected to three test conditions; saline, cocaine and footshock.
phase 2: extinction and testing. during extinction and
testing, which occurred over four consecutive days, animals were housed 24 hours per day in the self-administration chambers. food and water were freely available
to animals, except during daily extinction and test sessions. animals were brought to the chambers in the
evening preceding the first day of extinction and testing. since two separate groups of rats were run each
day during the training phase, one group of animals
was tested in the first four days of phase 2 and the other
group of animals was tested in the next four days. during extinction and testing, all of the conditions that
were present during training were maintained except
that lever presses did not result in cocaine infusions.
in this and all subsequent reinstatement experiments, animals were given several daily 1-h extinction
sessions separated by intervening periods in which the

alpha-2 agonists and relapse to cocaine seeking 141

lever was withdrawn. on day 1, animals were given
four extinction sessions; on days 2–4, animals were
given two to three extinction sessions, sufficient to establish a baseline level of responding of 15 or fewer responses in one hour, followed by a 180 min test session.
the duration of the intervening periods was kept constant for each experiment and corresponded to the delay required for drug absorption between pretreatment
injections and the start of the test. in the present experiment, the duration of intervening periods was 40 min.
at test, separate groups of animals were pretreated
with either 0, 20, or 40 ␮g/kg, i.p., clonidine before each
of three tests for reinstatement (saline, cocaine, and
footshock), given on consecutive days and in a counterbalanced order. clonidine was injected 40 min before
the lever was inserted. for the saline and cocaine priming tests, animals were given a non-contingent, i.p., injection of saline or cocaine (20 mg/kg) 5 min before lever insertion. for the footshock tests, animals were
exposed to the 15-min brief intermittent footshock stress
immediately before insertion of the lever. test sessions
were 3-h in duration. the dose of cocaine and footshock
parameters were chosen on the basis of previous work
from this laboratory (erb et al. 1996; erb et al. 1998; shaham et al. 1998). the doses of clonidine were chosen on
the basis of reinstatement experiments we have conducted with heroin-trained rats (shaham et al. 2000).

experiment 3a: effects of  xxxd2500xxx  on high rates
of responding for sucrose
because the pharmacological profile for  xxxd2500xxx  has
not been as well characterized as that for clonidine, an
experiment was conducted to establish whether, and at
what doses,  xxxd2500xxx  induces performance deficits.
the doses in the tests for reinstatement were chosen on
the basis of results obtained in this experiment.
subjects. the subjects were 8 male long-evans rats
(charles river, quebec) weighing 400–550 g at the beginning of the experiment. rats were previously used
in an experiment aimed at studying footshock-induced
reinstatement of sucrose seeking (buczek et al. 1999).
animals were maintained under similar conditions to
those described in experiment 1.
apparatus. each self-administration chamber was
equipped with two stationary levers, symmetrically
centered on one side panel, 5 cm above the floor. responses on one lever, the “active” lever, activated a
pump (razel sci. stamford, ct). responses on the other
lever, the “dummy” lever, were recorded but were
without consequence. activation of the pump resulted
in a 20-second delivery of 0.18 ml sucrose solution to a
liquid drop receptacle located between the two levers.
throughout the sucrose delivery period, a white stimulus light just above the active lever was illuminated and

additional responses during this time were recorded
but did not result in reactivation of the pump.
drugs.  xxxd2500xxx  hcl was generously supplied by
keith davies, britannia pharmaceuticals ltd., uk. the
drug was dissolved in physiological saline and injected
i.p. (0, 80, 120, 160 or 200 ␮g/kg).
procedure. animals that had previously learned to
self-administer sucrose in a different study (buczek et
al. 1999) were subsequently given five sessions over
five consecutive days in which they self-administered a
30% sucrose solution on an fr-1 schedule. in subsequent daily sessions, animals were injected with either
vehicle (0 ␮g/kg) or  xxxd2500xxx  (80, 120, 160 or 200 ␮g/
kg, i.p.) 60 min before the start of the self-administration session. all animals received all doses of  xxxd2500xxx 
in a counterbalanced order; the highest dose of  xxxd2500xxx  was tested twice. each session in which animals
were treated with  xxxd2500xxx  was followed by a saline
pretreatment session to minimize the possibility of
carry-over effects of the drug.

experiment 3b: effects of  xxxd2500xxx  on footshockand cocaine-induced reinstatement
subjects. the subjects were 49 male long-evans rats
(34 from charles river, quebec; 15 from harlan sprague
dawley, usa) weighing 350–400 g at the beginning of
the experiment. the animals were maintained as described in experiment 1. there were no obvious differences in responding between animals from the two suppliers in any phase of the experiment.
procedure. phase 1: training. animals were trained to
self-administer cocaine under the conditions described
in experiment 2.
phase 2: extinction and testing. in this experiment the
intervening periods, as described above, were 60 min in
duration. at test, separate groups of animals were pretreated with either 0, 50, 100, 150, or 200 ␮g/kg, i.p.,
 xxxd2500xxx  before each of three tests for reinstatement
(saline, cocaine, and footshock stress), given on consecutive days and in a counterbalanced order (see experiment 2).  xxxd2500xxx  was injected 60 min before the insertion of the lever. test sessions were 3-h in duration.
the doses of  xxxd2500xxx  were chosen on the basis of the
results obtained in experiment 3a.

procedure. phase 1: training. animals were trained to
self-administer cocaine under the conditions described
in experiment 2.
phase 2: extinction and testing. in this experiment the
intervening periods, as described above, were 60 min in
duration. at test, animals were pretreated with 0 or 640
␮g/kg  xxxd2241xxx , i.p., before each of two tests for reinstatement (no footshock, footshock or saline, cocaine),
given on consecutive days (see experiment 2).  xxxd2241xxx  was injected 60 min before the insertion of the lever. test sessions were 3-h in duration. the dose of  xxxd2241xxx  was chosen on the basis of its substitutability
for 40 ␮g/kg clonidine in a drug discrimination procedure (bennett and lal 1982).

statistical analyses
microdialysis data were analyzed using a mixed-factor
anova for concentration of extracellular ne in 20 min
dialysate samples; the between-subjects factor was dose
of clonidine (0, 20, 40 ␮g/kg),  xxxd2500xxx  (0, 75, or 150
␮g/kg), or  xxxd2241xxx  (0 or 640 ␮g/kg) and the repeated measure was time. significant time by dose interactions were subjected to one-way anovas for the
factor of dose at specific time points. when appropriate,
post hoc tests (fisher’s lsd, p ⬍ .05) were conducted to
compare vehicle (0 ␮g/kg) to drug conditions.
the two dependent measures in the tests for reinstatement were number of responses on the active lever
(infusions ⫹ time out responses) and number of responses on the inactive lever in three hours. all behavioral data are presented as means ⫾ sem. because of
considerable variability in the number of responses
made in the different tests for reinstatement, the nonparametric statistics for related (friedman and wilcoxon) and unrelated (kruskal-wallis and mannwhiney) samples were used where appropriate.
for the sucrose study (experiment 3a) the dependent measures were the number of responses on the active (reinforced ⫹ timeout responses) and inactive levers and the number of reinforcements obtained.
repeated measures anovas were conducted with
dose as the within-subject factor. when appropriate,
post hoc tests (fisher’s lsd, p ⬍ .05) were conducted to
compare vehicle (0 ␮g/kg) to drug conditions.

discussion
two major findings emerge from the present series of
experiments. first, systemic injections of clonidine and
 xxxd2500xxx  attenuate the footshock-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking, but have no effect on reinstatement induced by priming injections of cocaine. second,
the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist,  xxxd2241xxx ,
which unlike clonidine and  xxxd2500xxx  has a low affinity
for i1 receptors (piletz et al. 1994), also attenuates footshock-induced reinstatement. these effects were obtained by drugs that at similar doses and under similar
stress parameters to those used in the tests for reinstatement suppressed the footshock-induced increase in ne
release in amg and/or pfc in naïve animals. these
findings suggest that reduction of brain ne activity
may be an effective way to prevent stress-induced relapse to cocaine seeking.
the finding that clonidine,  xxxd2500xxx , and  xxxd2241xxx  attenuate footshock-induced but not cocaine-

neuropsychopharmacology 2000–vol. 23, no. 2

induced reinstatement was not unexpected in view of
our previous findings that stress- and drug-induced relapse can be dissociated pharmacologically. as mentioned, crf receptor antagonists attenuate footshockinduced, but not drug-induced relapse (erb et al. 1998;
shaham et al. 1997). from these data it seems logical to
consider that footshock stress may have its effects on reinstatement through an interaction between the crf
and ne systems. although the present data do not bear
directly on where in the brain this interaction might
take place, we have recent data that do (erb and stewart 1999; shaham et al. 2000). we found first that
6-ohda lesions of the ventral ne pathway attenuate
footshock-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking,
whereas injections of clonidine or st-91 (a less diffusible charged analogue of clonidine) directly into the locus coeruleus were not effective (shaham et al. 2000).
on the basis of this work and additional studies on the
site of action of crf and its receptor antagonist,  xxxd1793xxx 
crf12-41, we have proposed that the effects of footshock
on relapse may be mediated by the interaction between
ne and crf in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis
(bnst) and/or the central nucleus of the amg. we have
found that local injections of crf and its receptor antagonist,  xxxd1793xxx -crf12-41, in the bnst act to induce and
block stress-induced reinstatement, respectively (erb
and stewart 1999). the ventral ne bundle provides the
primary source of ne to both the bnst and central nucleus of the amg (aston-jones et al. 1995; terenzi and ingram 1995) and both structures are known to contain crf
cell bodies (phelix and paull 1990; veinante et al. 1997);
furthermore, the crf cell bodies of the central nucleus of
the amg project to the bnst (sakanaka et al. 1986).
whereas footshock-induced reinstatement may be
mediated by the ne and crf systems, the effects of
priming injections of psychostimulant and opioid drugs
on relapse to drug seeking have been shown to be mediated by the midbrain dopaminergic system (self and
nestler 1998; stewart 1984; stewart and vezina 1988). it
is interesting, however, that clonidine is known to have
effects on the functioning of midbrain dopaminergic
neurons (lategan et al. 1990). for example, it has been
shown that systemic injections of alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists decrease dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (murai et al. 1998) and the pfc
(gobert et al. 1998). these effects may be due to the effect of alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists on dopamine cell firing. grenhoff and svensson (1989) have
shown that clonidine regularizes midbrain dopamine
cell firing in anesthetized rats, an effect that should reduce dopamine release from terminals (roth et al.
1987). these changes, however, may not have been sufficient to prevent increases in extracellular dopamine in
the nucleus accumbens, in the face of cocaine-induced
blockade of dopamine reuptake. it is also possible that
previous exposure to cocaine during the self-adminis-

alpha-2 agonists and relapse to cocaine seeking 147

tration phase of the study served to increase dopamine
availability in the nucleus accumbens, thereby increasing sensitivity to a priming injection of the drug (kalivas and duffy 1993).
the effects of clonidine and  xxxd2500xxx  observed in
this study could have been mediated through their actions at i1 rather than alpha-2 receptors. the nm affinity
of clonidine for the alpha-2 receptor is 28 ⫾ 2.6 and for
the i1 receptor is 0.99 ⫾ 0.43 (ernsberger et al. 1990); the
affinity of  xxxd2500xxx  for these receptors is almost identical (buccafusco et al. 1995). alpha-2 and i1 receptors
have been shown, however, to be differentially involved in biochemical and behavioral effects of alpha-2
adrenergic receptor agonists (for a review see piletz et
al. 1994). for example, in drug discrimination studies,
alpha-2 receptors appear to be responsible for a clonidine-induced cue, for which both  xxxd2500xxx  and  xxxd2241xxx  (a compound with nm affinity for alpha-2 receptor
of 7.2 ⫾ 0.6 and for the i1 receptor of ⬎ 1,000,000) substitute dose-dependently (bennett and lal 1982; jordan et
al. 1993; lal and yaden 1985). on the other hand, i 1 receptors of the medulla are thought to mediate the antihypertensive actions of these drugs (buccafusco et al.
1995; but see guyenet 1997). although not definitive in
view of the fact that  xxxd2241xxx  was not tested independently for rate-reducing effects, it appears unlikely that
the attenuation of the footshock-induced reinstatement
of cocaine seeking was i1-receptor mediated;  xxxd2241xxx , a drug with a low affinity for the i1 receptor, attenuated footshock-induced reinstatement of cocaineseeking at a dose that has been shown to substitute for
40 ␮g/kg clonidine in a drug discrimination task (bennett and lal 1982).
three issues might be seen to complicate the interpretation of the present findings. first, clonidine,  xxxd2500xxx  and  xxxd2241xxx  might affect motor performance
(see monti 1982; stanford 1995); second, these drugs
might act at peripheral rather than central receptors
(buccafusco et al. 1995); and finally, it is possible that
the analgesic actions of these drugs (see codd et al.
1995) mediate their effect on footshock-induced reinstatement. with respect to the first, it is unlikely that the
effects were due to a performance deficit. in the saline
and cocaine priming conditions, neither clonidine,
 xxxd2500xxx  nor  xxxd2241xxx  reduced responding on the
active lever. furthermore, the doses of clonidine and
 xxxd2500xxx  used in the tests for reinstatement were chosen because they had little or no effect on high rates of
responding for sucrose. after the highest dose of clonidine tested (40 ␮g/kg) in sucrose-trained animals (shaham et al. 2000), animals responded nearly 100 times in
20 min; likewise, in experiment 3a, animals injected
with the highest dose of  xxxd2500xxx  (200 ␮g/kg) obtained close to 40 reinforcements in 30 min and demonstrated no significant reduction in response rate.
the possibility that the effects observed in the

148 s. erb et al.

present study were due to the actions of the alpha-2 agonists at peripheral rather than central receptors also
seems unlikely. first, we found in a study with herointrained rats that i.c.v. injections of clonidine were as effective as systemic injections in blocking the footshockinduced reinstatement (shaham et al. 2000). additionally,
we have given systemic injections of 40 ␮g/kg st-91
(the charged analogue of clonidine which does not effectively cross the blood brain barrier) to cocainetrained animals and have found that st-91-treated
animals show a comparable footshock-induced reinstatement of responding (90.75 ⫾ 26.37 in three hours)
to vehicle-treated animals (115.63 ⫾ 24.49 in three
hours; unpublished data). it would appear, therefore,
that the effects of systemic injections of clonidine on
footshock-induced reinstatement of both heroin and cocaine seeking are mediated centrally.
finally, it seems unlikely that footshock-induced reinstatement of drug seeking is mediated by analgesic
effects of these drugs at the doses used. observations
made during the footshock sessions revealed that both
vehicle- and drug-pretreated animals reacted similarly
to the footshocks throughout the shock period. these
observations are consistent with the finding that clonidine, within a similar dose range to the one used in the
present study, does not alter threshold sensitivity to
footshock (soderpalm and engel 1988).
in conclusion, the present findings may have clinical
implications. first, the results presented here may provide a rationale for the use of alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists in treatment programs for the prevention of
relapse to drug use. currently, these drugs are being
used with some success in the short-term treatment of
opioid withdrawal (lin et al. 1997; warner et al. 1997).
the present findings suggest that they may be effective
in the treatment of cocaine users (mcdougle et al. 1994)
if given for a more prolonged period (see herman and
o’brien 1997). second, the present experiments demonstrate a similar efficacy of clonidine and  xxxd2500xxx  in
preventing footshock-induced reinstatement of cocaine
seeking. this finding is of potential clinical significance
in that  xxxd2500xxx  has been reported in humans to be associated with fewer adverse side effects than clonidine,
in particular fewer hypotensive effects (carnwath and
hardman 1998; kahn et al. 1997; lin et al. 1997).
