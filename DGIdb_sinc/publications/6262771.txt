abstract local anesthetics such as  xxxd1869xxx , qx572, tetracaine, and phenacaine, as well as other drugs with local anesthetic-like properties (e.g.,  xxxd3060xxx , propranolol, and skf
525a) inhibit the specific calmodulin-dependent stimulation of
erythrocyte ca2+-atpase (atp phosphohydrolase,  xxxg225xxx   xxxg265xxx   xxxg441xxx   xxxg621xxx   xxxg725xxx   xxxg726xxx   xxxg1213xxx   xxxg2173xxx   xxxg2174xxx   xxxg2428xxx .3)
and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (3',5'-cyclic-nucleotide
5'-nucleotidohydrolase,  xxxg1501xxx   xxxg1690xxx   xxxg1691xxx   xxxg1692xxx   xxxg1693xxx   xxxg1694xxx   xxxg1695xxx   xxxg1696xxx   xxxg1697xxx   xxxg1698xxx   xxxg1699xxx   xxxg1700xxx   xxxg1701xxx   xxxg1704xxx   xxxg1705xxx .17) from brain and heart. basal
activities of these enzymes in the absence of calmodulin are relatively unaffected by concentrations of local anesthetics that
strongly inhibit the specific stimulation by calmodulin. increasing
calmodulin, but not ca2+, overcomes the inhibitory action of the
local anesthetics on brain phosphodiesterase. however excess
calmodulin does not fully restore activity of erythrocyte ca1+-stimulated atpase. although the mechanism(s) by which the local anesthetics act is unclear, they inhibit binding of '25i-labeled calmodulin to the erythrocyte membrane. antagonism of calmodulin
provides a molecular mechanism that may explain the inhibition
of many ca2+-dependent cellular processes by local anestheticse.g., ca2+ transport, exocytosis, excitation-contraction coupling,
non-muscle-cell motility, and aggregation.

local anesthetics are classified as such by their ability to block
conduction of impulses in nerves reversibly. however, these
drugs can also affect a wide range of cellular processes in nonnerve tissue, such as excitation-contraction coupling in various
types of muscle (1, 2), exocytosis (3-6), membrane transport or
permeability of calcium (7), glucose (8), and anions (9), cellular
adhesion (10) or aggregation (11), osmotic fragility (12), and ligand-induced ig receptor capping (13). several enzymatic activities are also affected by local anesthetics, notably response
of adenylate cyclase to catecholamines (14), mg2+,ca2+-dependent atpases of brain (15), sarcoplasmic reticulum (16), and
erythrocytes (17), and  xxxg1759xxx  (18). many of the effects
of local anesthetics are manifested on calcium-dependent processes and have usually been attributed to influences on membrane calcium permeability or binding (19).
in addition to effects of local anesthetics mediated by membrane pertubations we considered that antagonism of ca2+-mediated processes might be due to effects on the actions of calmodulin. calmodulin, a ubiquitous ca2+-binding protein in
eukaryotes, is one of the most important mediators ofcalcium's
role as an intracellular messenger, affecting contractile proteins, cyclic nucleotide metabolism, glycogenolysis, phospholipid metabolism, membrane phosphorylation, and ca2+ transport (20, 21). we therefore undertook a study of the influence
of local anesthetics on several calmodulin-dependent enzymatic
reactions. in this paper we report on two such enzymes; ca2+atpase (atp phosphohydrolase,  xxxg225xxx   xxxg265xxx   xxxg441xxx   xxxg621xxx   xxxg725xxx   xxxg726xxx   xxxg1213xxx   xxxg2173xxx   xxxg2174xxx   xxxg2428xxx .3) of the erythrocyte
membrane and  xxxg1696xxx  (3',5'cyclic nucleotide 5'-nucleotidohydrolase,  xxxg1501xxx   xxxg1690xxx   xxxg1691xxx   xxxg1692xxx   xxxg1693xxx   xxxg1694xxx   xxxg1695xxx   xxxg1696xxx   xxxg1697xxx   xxxg1698xxx   xxxg1699xxx   xxxg1700xxx   xxxg1701xxx   xxxg1704xxx   xxxg1705xxx .17) from

brain and cardiac muscle. preliminary reports of these findings
have been published (22, 23).
methods and materials
preparation of human erythrocyte membranes. erythrocyte membranes were prepared by the method of gopinath and
vincenzi (24) modified by carrying out hemolysis in 10 mm imidazole hcl, ph 7.4/1 mm edta. aliquots (2.0 ml) of the
membrane suspensions containing 1.0-1.7 mg of protein per
ml were frozen in dry ice/acetone and stored at -800c.
assay of calcium atpase. calcium-stimulated atpase activity in the membranes was measured by the radioisotope assay
of seals et al. (25) as described in the legend to fig. 1.
purification of erythrocyte calmodulin. calmodulin was
purified according to the method of jarrett and penniston (26)
through the sephadex g-100 chromatography step. active fractions were dialyzed against water, lyophilized, and redissolved
in the minimal volume of 10 mm 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid at ph 6.5. pure calmodulin was isolated by preparative discontinuous ph/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(27). in 10.5% polyacrylamide, calmodulin migrated with the
bromophenol blue dye front and was eluted from the gels into
0.1 m potassium phosphate, ph 6.6/1 mm ethylene glycol
bis(f3-aminoethyl ether)-n,n,n',n'-tetraacetic acid (egta).
purity of the calmodulin was verified by nadodso4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and comparison of activity with
a calmodulin standard obtained from d. m. watterson.
binding of 125i-labeled calmodulin to erythrocyte membranes. calmodulin was iodinated as described by chafouleas
et al. (28). binding of l"i-labeled calmodulin to membranes was
measured by incubation under the same conditions as described
for atpase assays. after 15 min of incubation, the membrane
suspensions were placed onto sepharose 4b (400 mesh) columns
(0.6 x 13 cm) and eluted at 37°c. the elution solution was the
same as the incubation medium except that mgatp was deleted
and mgcl2 was increased to 2 mm and ca2+ or local anesthetic
was included if present in the initial incubation. fractions (0.3
ml) were collected and assayed for radioactivity in a gamma
spectrometer. total recovery of radioactivity from the column
was >98%, indicating negligible binding to the column. the
bound and free calmodulin were well separated from each other;
membranes and membrane-bound calmodulin eluted in fracabbreviations: egta, ethylene glycol bis(,8-aminoethyl ether)n,n,n',n'-tetraacetic acid; qx572, n,n-bis(phenylcarbamoylmethyl)dimethylammonium chloride; mes, 2-(n-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; tlck, na-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone; skf

in 150 ml of 10 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.0/1 mm egta/40 ,um
na-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (tlck) at 4°c. the
homogenate was adjusted to ph 6.0 with acetic acid and centrifuged at 177,400 x g (rm.) for 60 min. the supernatant was
applied, by ascending flow, to a column (2.6 x 20 cm) of deaesephacel equilibrated in a buffer designed for maximal stability
of phosphodiesterase (29): 5 mm 2-(n-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (mes), 30% ethylene glycol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5%
(wt/vol) glucose, 10 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm naf, 20 am
tlck, 1 mm egta (ph 6.5); the column was washed with 8
bed volumes ofthe same buffer. phosphodiesterase activity was
eluted with  xxxd3426xxx -ml linear gradient of sodium acetate (ph 6.5)
from 0.01 to 1.2 m in the same buffer readjusted to ph 6.5. the
flow rate was 1 ml/min, and 4-ml fractions were collected.
enzyme activity eluting between 15 and 19 ms (0.24-0.34 m
sodium acetate) was pooled and used as the source of calmodulin-sensitive phosphodiesterase. activity was the same when
assayed in the presence of cacl2 (0.1 mm) or egta (1 mm),
indicating complete separation of the enzyme from endogenous
calmodulin. in the absence ofcalmodulin the enzyme had a vm.
of 0.071 amol/min per mg of protein and a km of 45 ,um camp.
in the presence of 40 nm calmodulin, the vm. increased to 0.26
amol/min per mg of protein and the km was 53 /m camp.

calmodulin-stimulated ca2+-atpase. assays were carried out as described in the legend for fig. 1 except that cacl2 was varied. the calmodulin concentrations were: 96 nm in a, 192 nm in b, and 14.6 pm
in c. experiments shown are for 'membranes without calmodulin

results
inhibition of calcium atpase. the mean (± sem) atpase
activity of erythrocyte membranes prepared as described was
0.23 0.015 ,mol of phosphate per mg of protein per hr in the
presence of mg2e and 0.1 mm egta; it increased to 0.63
0.03 after addition of 0.2 mm cacl2. this "basal" ca2+-stimulated atpase activity was completely inhibited by  xxxd3431xxx  and by calcineurin (kindly donated by c. klee), indicating
the presence of some residual endogenous calmodulin. nevertheless, the enzyme could be markedly stimulated by the addition of exogenous calmodulin (fig. 1).
the degree of enhancement of atpase activity depended
upon the concentrations of both ca2+ and calmodulin (fig. 2).
increasing calmodulin concentration increased the atpase activity at the optimal ca2' level. at high concentrations of calmodulin the sensitivity to calcium was increased so that activity
was nearly maximal even at the lower calcium concentrations
(fig. 2c). a similar effect of high calmodulin concentration on
calcium sensitivity has been observed with heart phosphodiesterase (34). increasing calcium beyond the optimum resulted
in a decreased atpase activity independent of the calmodulin
concentration, as also observed by luthra and kim (35).
several local anesthetics inhibited the stimulatory effect of
calmodulin. the basal mg2e,ca2+-atpase activity was not inhibited (or was only slightly inhibited, :15%) by anesthetic
concentrations that strongly (>80%) antagonized the stimulation by calmodulin.  xxxd1869xxx  shifted the concentration-response
curves for the modulator protein (fig. 1). increasing calmodulin
tended to overcome the local anesthetic inhibition (fig. 1), but

the normal calmodulin stimulation of aktpase activity in the
presence of local anesthetics (fig. 2). inihibition of the rate of
atp hydrolysis was a function of dibucaii ne concentration (fig.
3a) and occurred at different concentratic)ns ofcalmodulin (fig.
3b). inhibition by  xxxd1869xxx  also was evidlent at the approximate
physiological concentration ofcalmodulin (=1 ,m) in the intact
erythrocyte (figs. 1 and 2c).
in addition to  xxxd1869xxx , other local an esthetics inhibited the

stimulation of ca2+-atpase by calmodulin; the approximate
concentrations for 50% inhibition (ic50) determined at 66 nm
calmodulin (0.9-1.0 vma,) were:  xxxd3060xxx , 0.15 mm;  xxxd1869xxx , 0.26 mm; tetracaine, 1.0 mm; phenacaine, 1.0 mm; and

inhibition of 125i-labeled calmodulin binding to erythrocyte membranes by local anesthetics. binding of "2i-labeled
calmodulin to erythrocyte membranes was low in the absence
of ca2' but increased markedly in the presence of0.2 mm cacl2
plus 0.1 mm egta (fig. 4).  xxxd1869xxx  produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of '"i-labeled calmodulin binding
(fig. 4) similar to the inhibition of ca2+-atpase activity under
the same conditions (fig. 3). other local anesthetics also inhibited binding (the details of these experiments will be presented elsewhere).

calmodulin maximally stimulated enzyme activity
3.7-foldam),
with half-maximal stimulation at 3.5 nm calmodulin.
the calmodulin stimulation of  xxxg1696xxx  from both rat brain and bovine heart was inhibited by
local anesthetics and drugs exhibiting local anesthetic properties. in the presence of 0.5 mm  xxxd1869xxx , the apparent km of
phosphodiesterase for calmodulin increased from 3.5 nm to
about 170 nm at 0.25 mm  xxxd1773xxx  and from 6 nm to about
400 nm at 1 am  xxxd1274xxx  (fig. 5). lineweaver-burk analysis
indicated that inhibition by  xxxd1869xxx  was competitive with respect to calmodulin with a calculated ki of 8-10 mm. in a separate experiment using higher concentrations ofcalmodulin, the
inhibition of  xxxd1773xxx  hydrolysis by 0.5 mm  xxxd1869xxx  was

different from the particulate ca2+-atpase system in which inhibition by  xxxd1869xxx  was still apparent at this calmodulin concentration (fig. 1). as observed with the ca2+-atpase system,
inhibition of phosphodiesterase by  xxxd1869xxx  could not be overcome by increasing calcium up to 1 mm.
 xxxd1869xxx  had no effect on basal (minus calmodulin) phosphodiesterase activity at a concentration equal to its apparent
kj against calmodulin. even at 0.5 mm  xxxd1869xxx , which shifted
the calmodulin dose-response curve =50-fold, the basal activity was inhibited by only 14%. at a constant calmodulin concentration (15 nm), the inhibition by  xxxd1869xxx  appeared to be
noncompetitive with respect to  xxxd1773xxx  as substrate when
analyzed by lineweaver-burk analysis. inhibition of basal
phosphodiesterase activity required much higher concentrations of  xxxd1869xxx  and appeared to be competitive with respect
to substrate (k. =5 mm). similarly, a calmodulin-insensitive,
low-kn phosphodiesterase purified from kidney (29) was also
inhibited by local anesthetics in a competitive manner with respect to substrate. thus, local anesthetics had two effects: one
at low concentrations directed against the effect of calmodulin
and independent of substrate and ca2' concentration, and the
second at high concentrations affecting the affinity of the enzyme for substrate.
in addition to  xxxd1869xxx , calmodulin stimulation of phosphodiesterase was inhibited by other local anesthetics and  xxxd3060xxx , propranolol, and ,b diethylaminoethyl-2,2-diphenyl
pentanoate (skf 525a) (table 1). the action of propranolol was
nonstereospecific and therefore was related to its local anesthetic-like properties rather than to its activity as a f3-adrenergic
antagonist. the relative ic50 values for the inhibition of the
phosphodiesterase were lower than those obtained for the inhibition of the ca2+-atpase (see above); however, the ic50 values for the brain enzyme were determined at 15 nm calmodulin (0.9-1.0 vm. for phosphodiesterase activation), whereas
those for the erythrocyte ca2+-atpase were determined at 66
nm calmodulin (0.9-1.0 vm. for ca2+-atpase activation). relative ic50 values may vary depending upon the concentration
of calmodulin used.
discussion
the present results demonstrate that some local anesthetics and
other drugs which act as calcium antagonists (12), such as  xxxd3060xxx , propranolol, and skf 525a, inhibit the stimulatory

effect of calmodulin on enzymes with little or no effect on the
activity of these enzymes in the absence of calmodulin. according to current models for the action of calmodulin, increased concentrations of ca2+ or the modulator protein promote the formation of the ca2+-calmodulin complex, which in
turn shifts the equilibrium for an enzyme from the inactive to
the active form (20, 21). calmodulin appears to be present in
cells in excess of the concentration of the enzymes it affects so
that cellular calcium fluxes would be most important for regulating enzyme activity. phenothiazines bind to specific sites
on the ca2+-calmodulin complex with the result that the ternary complex is rendered ineffectual in activating enzymes (36).
similarly, local anesthetics could make the concentration of the
modulator protein rather than ca2' the rate-limiting factor by
inactivating calmodulin or by preventing binding of calmodulin
to enzymes.
local anesthetics inhibit the ability ofcalmodulin to stimulate
two different types of enzymes; one an integral membrane protein involved in transport of ca2+, and the other a soluble enzyme concerned with cyclic nucleotide degradation. the action
of the anesthetics is therefore not confined to membrane-dependent reactions.
the local anesthetics prevent binding of calmodulin to the
erythrocyte membrane, producing a corresponding inhibition
of atpase activity. however, we have not as yet identified the
site, or sites, of action of the local anesthetics as being on calmodulin itself [as has been postulated for phenothiazines (36)],
on the calmodulin recognition site of the enzyme, or on some
other regulatory site.
we propose that many ofthe pharmacological actions oflocal
anesthetics, which are directed against calcium-dependent cellular processes, may be due to antagonism of calmodulin's effects on enzymes because both the pharmacological effects and
the inhibition ofcalmodulin in vitro occur at similar concentrations of these drugs (1-13). for example, inhibition of ca2+
transport in erythrocytes by local anesthetics (37) may be related
to the need for calmodulin in the transport process (38). similarly, inhibition of smooth muscle contraction (2) and non-muscle cellular motility (10) by local anesthetics could be produced
by inhibition of calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain phosphorylation (39) as observed with phenothiazines (40). also, inhibition of the mobilization of  xxxd208xxx  from phospholipids by local anesthetics (41, 42) may be related to the reported
stimulation of  xxxg1759xxx  by calmodulin (43).
antagonism ofcalmodulin could also be responsible for some
ofthe actions oflocal anesthetics on synaptic transmission. local
anesthetics as well as  xxxd3431xxx  (44) depress responses of
some chemosensitive postsynaptic membranes. the role of calmodulin in the nervous system is not yet understood but it may
play an important role in presynaptic and postsynaptic processes. wood et al (45) and lin et al (46) have localized calmodulin by immunocytochemical methods to postsynaptic membranes in mouse and rat brain. grab et al (47) identified
calmodulin in postsynaptic densities isolated from canine cerebral cortex. calmodulin can activate brain synaptic membrane
ca2+-atpase (48) and shulman and greengard (49) have shown
that calmodulin stimulates phosphorylation of brain membranes.
the diverse pharmacological effects of local anesthetics are
probably due to more than one mechanism of action. the mechanism by which anesthetics inhibit cell processes that are not
dependent on ca2+ may not involve calmodulin. for example,
effects on membrane permeability appear to be clearly attributable to interactions with specific ionic channels (50). on the
other hand, many of the other cellular actions of local anesthetics directed against ca2"-dependent processes may be due

biochemistry: volpi et al
to a specific molecular action, the antagonism of enzyme stimulation by calmodulin.
