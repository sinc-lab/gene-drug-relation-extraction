antiandrogens in combination with  xxxg930xxx 

agonists in prostate cancer

jean-pierre raynaud, d.sc.

the rationale of the combination of a nonsteroid antian-
drogen with an  xxxg930xxx  analogue ( xxxg930xxx -a) in the treat-
ment of prostate cancer is discussed. whereas the lh-
rh-a depresses testosterone (t) levels via an action on
the hypothalamus—pituitary-gonad axis, the antiandro-
gen counters the effect of any residual t, from the testes
or adrenals, on the target organ, the prostate. although
bilateral orchiectomy and administration of estrogen or
 xxxg930xxx -a give equivalent low t levels over long-term
treatment, the manner and rate at which t suppression
is achieved vary and each treatment presents character-
istic disadvantages. orchiectomy is irreversible, and it is
known that approximately 20% of patients will not benefit
from such endocrine manipulation, estrogen use is asso-
ciated with cardiovascular disease, and  xxxg930xxx  ana-
logues produce an early surge in t. none of these treat-
ments has any significant effect on adrenal androgen
levels, which may contribute toward the progression of
disease. nonsteroid antiandrogens such as  xxxd2725xxx  and
 xxxd2143xxx  inhibit the uptake of androgen by the prostate
by an action that probably involves the androgen recep-
tor. they do not possess the progestational and gluco-
corticoid component of steroid antiandrogens or their pi-
tuitary inhibitory activity but do exert some inhibition of
the i|7a-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase enzyme systems.
unlike steroids. the nonsteroid antiandrogens potentiate
the activity of  xxxg930xxx -a at the central level in the rat.
the inhibitory action of the combined treatment of *‘an-
andron +  xxxd387xxx ’’ on the prostate is greater than that
of each compound alone. clinical pharmacology studies
have demonstrated that both steroid and nonsteroid an-
tiandrogens can help to control the effect of increased t
levels (disease flare) that occur on initiating  xxxg930xxx -a
administration.  xxxg46xxx  (pap) levels
decrease immediately in spite of the increase in t. the
decrease appears faster when nonsteroid antiandrogens
are used. nonsteroid antiandrogens sensitize the pituitary
to stimulation by  xxxg930xxx  in eugonadal volunteers. the
results of randomized clinical studies with the combina-
tion of ‘‘nonsteroid antiandrogen +  xxxg930xxx -a”’ have es-
tablished a definite trend toward greater efficacy of the

combined treatment over monotherapy. further data are
needed to confirm this trend. in particular, further dose-
ranging studies are warranted since the need for  xxxg930xxx -
a doses that reduce t down to castration levels may not
be justified in the presence of a potent antiandrogen.
available evidence already indicates that the antiandro-
gen can counter the action of the high t levels that occur
at initiation of treatment with  xxxg930xxx -a. to obtain fur-
ther information on doses, monitoring of plasma hormone
and drug levels in conjunction with biological response
parameters such as pap levels is mandatory throughout
treatment, until escape occurs. obviously, the hormone
levels will tend to reflect the androgen deprivation ob-
tained by inhibition of steroid biosynthesis and metabo-
lism and constitute only a very indirect and misguided
measurement of the antiandrogen effect on the tumor that
is due to inhibition of androgen uptake. presently, the
limited availability of diseased prostate tissue in routine
clinical studies unfortunately makes the measurements
required to assess action on the tissue impractical if not
well nigh impossible.

key words: prostate cancer— xxxg930xxx  analogue—an-
tiandrogen— xxxd2725xxx —combination — therapy—pitui-
tary inhibition.

epithelial cells of the human prostate proliferate
in response to dihydrotestosterone (dht) (1), and
certain cell lines established from cancerous human
prostate tissue or from relevant animal models also
respond in this manner although a degree of vari-
ability in hormone responsiveness has been noted
even within a given cell line (2-8; wilding et al.,
personal communication). such observations can
account for the considerable, but also limited, suc-
cess of those therapies for prostate cancer that aim
antiandrogens +  xxxg930xxx  analogues s133

to reduce drastically the levels of bioavailable cir-
culating testosterone (t) that is converted into its
active metabolite dht within the prostate: reduc-
tion in t levels can be achieved by orchiectomy,
medical castration by estrogens or  xxxg930xxx  ana-
logues ( xxxg930xxx -a), and by inhibitors of t biosyn-
thesis that act both on the testes and the adrenals,
the latter providing precursors to t and dht for-
mation.

alternative therapies aim to block the conversion
of t into the much more active dht by inhibitors
of the enzyme sa-reductase that catalyzes this
transformation within the prostate (9) or the action
of all bioactive androgens on the prostate by the use
of antiandrogens that inhibit nuclear androgen up-
take. inhibition of androgen uptake by hormone-
responsive cells is a logical last resort especially if
an element of site-directed cytotoxicity (depending
on the structure of the drug) can be combined with
the antihormonal action.

antiandrogen therapy has been used alone or in
conjunction with castration. even following or-
chiectomy, the amount of dht in the prostate,
which is assumed to originate principally from con-
version of adrenal androgens (10,11), is far from
negligible (7,12-14). measurements of plasma 3a-
 xxxd175xxx  glucuronide after orchiectomy (15-
17) suggest that as much as 30% of bioactive an-
drogen (18) may be of extrasplanchnic origin. for
these reasons, orchiectomy is not a sufficient pro-
cedure to remove androgenic influence on the pros-
tate. this was indeed recognized early in the history
of the treatment of prostatic disease since adrena-
lectomy and hypophysectomy were used at relapse
(19), but these drastic manipulations afforded only
limited benefit at a highly advanced stage of the dis-
ease (20). the use of antiandrogens to counter the
influence of the remaining androgens as early as
possible, and preferably at the time of castration, is
now becoming increasingly widespread.

monotherapy with nonsteroid antiandrogens may
not be a sufficiently effective treatment because re-
lease of the negative control exerted by t on lh
and fsh at the level of the hypothalamopituitary
unit ultimately results in an increase in lh and t
that weakens the peripheral antiandrogen action of
the drug on the prostate (21-23). for this reason,
compounds that lower circulating t concentrations
were sought as adjuvants to antiandrogen therapy
(21). combination treatments with both estrogens
and progestins were tested in animal studies (24),
but these pituitary inhibitors were rapidly
superseded by  xxxg930xxx -a such as  xxxd387xxx , which
were found to have greater potency and specificity
(25,26).

in view of the parallel move over recent years
toward replacing orchiectomy and estrogens by lh-
rh-a, by urologists as well as oncologists, it now
becomes interesting to consider whether the com-
bined treatment of ‘‘antiandrogen +  xxxg930xxx -a”’
may not even be superior to ‘‘orchiectomy + an-
tiandrogen”’ on the condition that appropriate com-
pounds, doses, and administration schedules are
chosen.

mechanisms of action of
antiandrogens on the prostate and
hypothalamus-pituitary-—gonad axis

the presence of androgen receptors (ar) in the
prostate, including in benign prostate hypertrophy
(bph) and cancer specimens, has been widely de-
scribed. they occur almost exclusively in the epi-
thelial tissue (27). their presence has also been re-
ported in rat and human testicular tissue
(seminiferous tubules, germ cells, interstitial cells,
etc.) (28-30) and in the brain and pituitary of several
species (31-33). most of these studies have been
performed using the radiolabeled androgen ligand r
[881 (methyltrienolone) (34-36). antiandrogenic
compounds that block the nuclear uptake of andro-
gen by target cells can do so by inhibiting binding
to and activation of ar either by occupation of the
endogenous hormone binding site or by possible in-
terference at other, as yet hypothetical, sites.

several reports suggest that, in reconstituted cell-
free systems in vitro, steroid antiandrogens, such
as megestro] acetate (ma) and  xxxd1786xxx 
(cpa), are unable to activate and translocate ar
into the nucleus but can prevent ar translocation
by natural hormones (37-41). other reports suggest
that the receptor is translocated but without con-
comitant receptor replenishment (42). the antian-
drogen-receptor complexes may accumulate in the
nucleus but fail to enhance genetic transcription and
thus do not lead to the expression of all the andro-
gen-sensitive genes switched on by the endogenous
hormone. on the basis of certain unconfirmed re-
ports (43-45), ar binding of ma and cpa would,
in certain circumstances, give rise to weak andro-
genic responses: increase in prostate weight, growth
of androgen-sensitive mouse mammary tumors
(shionogi sc-115), induction of ornithine decarbox-
ylase activity and of  xxxg1723xxx  cl-
subunit mrna, and inhibition of plasma lh. how-
ever, these actions are hotly contested by other re-
searchers. nonsteroid antiandrogens such as hy-
droxyflutamide, the active metabolite of  xxxd2143xxx 
(46,47),  xxxd2725xxx  ( xxxd2725xxx ) (22,23,48), and prob-
ably ici 176334 (49,50) interact very weakly and

am j clin oncol (cct), vol. [1. suppl. 2, 1988
s134 j.p. raynaud

fleetingly with cytosol ar and inhibit its nuclear
translocation (51-53). they have no androgenic ac-
tivity. it has been hypothesized that  xxxd2725xxx  may
act as an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation
and that this interference with ar explains, at least
in part, the observed decreases in prostate weight
(54,55).

steroid and nonsteroid antiandrogens differ in
their specificity for steroid hormone receptors. as
demonstrated in a large-scale screening program,
ma and cpa bind to progestin and glucocorticoid
receptors and have demonstrable progestational and
antiglucocorticoid properties, whereas  xxxd2143xxx 
and  xxxd2725xxx  only interact with ar (56-59).

in the adult male, androgens exert a negative
feedback action on the hypothalamopituitary unit.
in vitro in cultures of rat anterior pituitary cells, t
and dht block the  xxxg930xxx -induced release of lh
(60) whereas both steroid and nonsteroid antiandro-
gens lift the blockade (21-23). such interference
with regulatory mechanisms explains the initial in-
crease in lh and t on administration to intact an-
imals of nonsteroid antiandrogens (21,24) that do
not have the progestational component of steroid
antiandrogens responsible for pituitary inhibitory
activity.

both steroid and nonsteroid antiandrogens can
also interfere with other protein targets, in partic-
ular the enzymes involved in androgen biosynthesis
and metabolism. adrenal steroid biosynthesis is
under dual regulation by camp and protein kinase
c (61). camp induces enzymes required for syn-
thesis of 17a-hydroxylated steroids, including the
adrenal androgens. activation of protein kinase c
may play a complementary role by enhancing the
induction of enzymes required for non-!7a-hydrox-
ylated steroid biosynthesis and inhibiting those in-
volved in the synthesis of androgens. in leydig
cells, t has a  xxxd2082xxx : it inhibits camp-induced
de novo synthesis of p-450,7, and increases the
decay of p-450,7, by an oxygen-mediated mecha-
nism (62). ma inhibits acth-stimulated cortisol
secretion in adrenal cells (63). cpa, however,
would appear to inhibit adrenocortical steroidoge-
nesis in vivo as a result of inadequate pituitary re-
lease of acth, an effect that has been attributed
to its corticoid-like activity (64). cpa inhibits 3p-
hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and c17,20-lyase in
mouse leydig cells (65). at high concentrations, flu-
tamide, hydroxyflutamide,  xxxd2725xxx , and cpa in-
hibit 17a-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities in
rat testicular microsomes (66).

neither  xxxd2143xxx  nor  xxxd2725xxx  appears to act as
a substrate for sa-reductase, but there have been
conflicting reports on ma inhibition of 5a-reductase

am j clin oncol (cct), vol. 11, suppl. 2, 1988

activity (67). in vivo, any antiandrogenic effect the
compounds may have would lead to lower enzyme
levels insofar as the enzyme is androgen dependent.

mechanisms of action of  xxxg930xxx 
analogues at the central and
testicular levels

to obtain maximal expression of peripheral an-
tihormonal activity with nonsteroid antiandrogens
like  xxxd2725xxx , it was considered wise to combine
antiandrogen therapy with treatment that lowers t
levels. levels of circulating t have been measured
after administration of many  xxxg930xxx -a (68,69) in
patients with prostate cancer in order to demon-
strate that castrate t levels (<0.2 ng/ml) can be
reached within 2 weeks to | month and maintained
throughout long-term treatment. relatively high
doses are required to obtain such an effect, but the
need to get down to castrate t levels for maximum
effectiveness of an antiandrogen that is given in as-
sociation has not been demonstrated and it should
be possible to reduce the  xxxg930xxx -a dose in com-
bination protocols.

the mechanism of the inhibitory action of lh-
rh-a has been the subject of much study over re-
cent years.  xxxg930xxx  receptors have been identified
in the limbic system (70), pituitary (71), in the testes
of the rat (72) but not of the human (73,74), in the
adrenals (75), and in dunning r33274h prostate tu-
mors (76). in the human male, an acute administra-
tion of  xxxg930xxx  or of a superactive analog releases
a surge of lh from the pituitary and consequently
of t from the gonads as observed during pulsatile
secretion of endogenous gnrh. such increases
occur on initiation of long-term treatment with lh-
rh-a and can explain the sudden exacerbation of
disease (‘‘flare-up’’) that is reported by approxi-
mately 10% of prostate cancer patients (77-81).
however, continued administration desensitizes pi-
tuitary receptors and leads, after the initial burst of
activity, to an inverted dose-related response, i.e..
a decrease in lh and t known as “‘paradoxical in-
hibition’? (82-85), which is the basis of the use of
these compounds in pathologies necessitating hor-
mone depletion (86).

the molecular mechanism of endogenous  xxxg930xxx 
action would appear to be as follows: following mi-
croaggregation of the receptor and internalization
of the gnrh-receptor complex, calcium enters the
cell, and binds to calmodulin with concomitant ac-
tivation of protein kinase c and initiation of phos-
phoinositol hydrolysis to diacylglycerol, which fur-
ther activates protein kinase c (87). how permanent
receptor occupancy by superagonists interferes
antiandrogens +  xxxg930xxx  analogues s135

with this molecular mechanism to desensitize the
cell to further stimulation has not yet been fully elu-
cidated.

inhibitory actions by  xxxg930xxx -a may operate not
only at the pituitary but also hypothalamic and tes-
ticular levels, i.e., inhibition of gnrh release by
the hypothalamus in response to increasing local
gnrh levels (short-loop feedback mechanism) or
direct inhibition by gnrh of gonadal steroidoge-
nesis through blockade of the 17a-hydroxylase and
c17_20 lyase cytochrome p4s9 enzyme complex (88).
this latter action occurs in the rat but not humans
(88-91). overall activity is highly dependent on the
chosen species, route of administration, and dose.

according to a recent report by forti et al. (92),
long-term  xxxg930xxx -a treatment also influences t
metabolism in humans. the activity of sa-reduc-
tase, an androgen-dependent enzyme, is decreased
by 50%, contrary to reports of increases in the rat
(93,94).

activity of the combination of
antiandrogens and  xxxg930xxx  analogues
(animal studies)

nonsteroid antiandrogens provoke increases in t
because of their antiandrogen action at the central
and pituitary levels;  xxxg930xxx -a, after an initial stim-
ulatory phase, diminish t levels. the efficacy of the
combination of antiandrogens and  xxxg930xxx -a was
thus investigated in experiments using the conven-
tional laboratory model, the rat, and a traditional
biological response parameter, prostate weight. the
first experiments (25,26) were performed with the
nonsteroid antiandrogen  xxxd2725xxx  ( xxxd2725xxx ) and
the  xxxg930xxx -a  xxxd387xxx . the activity of this com-
bination has since been amply confirmed (59,95-
97). the experiments have been reproduced with
varying success with other  xxxg930xxx -a and types of
antiandrogen, steroid (96-98) or nonsteroid
(99,100), and also with adrenal biosynthesis inhib-
itors like ketoconazole (101,102). with one excep-
tion, where the experiments were performed in dogs
(103,104), the rat was always used as a model in
spite of the now known disadvantages of this spe-
cles.

rats are far less sensitive to the inhibitory effects
of  xxxg930xxx -a (reduction in the number of pituitary
receptors, and receptor downregulation in gonads)
than other animal species and humans. complete
inhibition of t synthesis in the testes of male rats
can be achieved only by continuous infusion of
product (88) and not by repeated daily s.c. admin-
istration (105,106). daily s.c. injection of  xxxd387xxx 
alone over | or 6 months does not modify the basal

plasma lh level in rats whatever the dose, but the
amplitude of the response to  xxxd387xxx  does de-
crease over time if the dose is high enough (107). in
the rat, the analogue induces increased sa-reduc-
tase activity, which leads to formation of dht in
target tissues and thus compensates for the de-
creased formation of t (93,94). this action does not
occur in humans.

the rat also has some disadvantages with regard
to the study of the action of the antiandrogen. the
levels of adrenal androgens in the rat are exceed-
ingly low compared with those in humans (96,108)
and therefore any inhibition of adrenal androgen ac-
tion by the antiandrogen is likely to pass unnoticed.
to demonstrate the antiandrogenic activity of an-
andron vs. adrenal androgens in the rat, it was nec-
essary to infuse the rat with a cocktail of such an-
drogens to levels recorded in humans (96). the rat
is also perhaps less sensitive than the dog, and pos-
sibly humans, to the antiandrogenic activity of non-
steroids such as  xxxd2725xxx  (54,59). the results of 6-
month toxicology studies, using oral administration.
showed that 50 mg/kg of  xxxd2725xxx  in the rat but only
3 mg/kg in the dog could reduce prostate weight by
two-thirds (fig. 1). rat and dog prostate are known
to manifest differential susceptibility to dht-in-
duced abnormal hyperplasia (109). moreover. in
only two species, dogs and humans, does the bal-
ance between prostatic cell loss and renewal main-
tained by dht become abnormally disrupted with
a high spontaneous frequency and result in a large
proliferative overgrowth of the prostate producing

and 10 in cytosol prepared from human bph speci-
mens (59).

fig. 2. effect of a 2-week combined treatment of
“duserelin + xxxd2725xxx  ( xxxd2725xxx )” in intact adult
male rats (25). groups of eight adult male rats (spra-
gue—dawley, 230-250 g) were injected s.c. for 14 days
with saline (controls), 5 mg/rat/day of  xxxd2725xxx , 250
ng/rat/every second day of  xxxd387xxx , or both drugs.
rats were killed 24 h after the last injection. plasma
lh and testosterone concentrations were determined
by radioimmunoassay (ria), and prostate and seminal
vesicle weights were measured (means + sem).

tissues often develop simultaneously (110-112), al-
though they originate from different regions of the
prostate gland.

in spite of these important restrictions, the rat
remains a convenient laboratory model and has
been used to demonstrate the activity of combined
treatment by  xxxg930xxx -a and antiandrogens, as il-
lustrated in figs. 2-4. administration of a s.c. dose
(1 pg/kg) of  xxxg930xxx -a alone every other day for 2
weeks to intact adult male rats increased lh and
decreased t, resulting in a significant decrease in
prostate and seminal vesicle weights (fig. 2). ad-
ministration of 20 mg/kg  xxxd2725xxx  s.c. and daily in-
creased lh and t, as expected, but also decreased
prostate and seminal vesicle weights. however, the
combination of ‘‘ xxxd387xxx  +  xxxd2725xxx ’’ led to
greater decreases in weight than either treatment
alone whether treatment was pursued for 2 weeks
(fig. 2) or 5 months.

this enhanced decrease on coadministration of

am j clin oncol (cct), vol. 11, suppl. 2, 1988

 xxxd2725xxx , confirmed in later experiments (96), is
also observed with the nonsteroid antiandrogen flu-
tamide (99,100) but not with the steroid antiandro-
gens medrogestone (98) and  xxxd1786xxx 
(96,97) (figs. 3 and 4). there are several plausible
explanations for this synergy.

(a)  xxxd2725xxx  may inhibit the activity of circulat-
ing adrenal androgens and of their metabolites as
previously shown (96,113), although the bioactivity
of these androgens that are present in very low con-
centration in the rat is considered rather limited.
redding and schally (114) failed to observe in-
creased inhibition of androgen-dependent tumor
growth on combining the antiandrogen  xxxd2143xxx 
with orchiectomy and kyprianou and isaacs (115)
found no additional decrease in ventral prostatic cell
number on orchiectomy plus adrenalectomy com-
pared to orchiectomy alone. this is in contrast to
the result of foldesy et al. (99), who have observed
a further decrease in prostate weight on adrenalec-
tomy.

(b) another explanation for the increased inhi-
bition of the combination of ‘‘ xxxd2725xxx  + busere-
lin’’ may be that s.c.  xxxd387xxx  does not.completely
suppress t in the rat and that the action of the re-
sidual t, which is still able to promote prostate
growth, is countered by the antiandrogen. how-
ever,  xxxd2725xxx  potentiates the action of  xxxd387xxx 
even if the analogue is administered as an implant
(m. moguilewsky, personal communication), con-
ditions under which t is more effectively sup-
pressed in the rat. the choice of administration
route would therefore not appear to be the sole rea-
son for enhanced activity. this does not mean that
residual t may not be implicated since, for instance,
huhtaniemi et al. (116) have shown that residual t
on long-term  xxxd387xxx  treatment is able to maintain
spermatogenesis in the human.

if only a peripheral antiandrogen action were in-
volved, equipotent steroid and nonsteroid antian-
drogens might be expected to exert similar poten-
tiation. oral doses of 20 mg/kg of  xxxd2725xxx  or cpa
are equally effective in countering the testosterone
propionate-induced increase in the prostate weight
of castrated rats and, at this dose, cpa has no an-
drogenic activity (m. moguilewsky, personal com-
munication). however, only 20 mg/kg  xxxd2725xxx  has
a pronounced potentiating effect, whereas med-
rogestone and cpa are virtually inactive (fig. 3).
these observations may partly explain why, in pre-
vious experiments, ellis and isaacs (117) have not
observed more effective tumor growth retardation
in the sublines of the serially transplantable dunning

when using the steroid antiandrogen cpa in com-
bination with surgical castration to effect complete
androgen withdrawal.

the difference in the ability of high levels of an-
andron and cpa to potentiate the inhibitory action
of  xxxg930xxx -a probably lies in the fact that, unlike
 xxxd2725xxx , which stimulates lh and t by its an-
tiandrogenic action on the pituitary, which it ‘‘sen-
sitizes,”” cpa is a potent pituitary inhibitor at this
dose. desensitization of pituitary and testicular lh
receptors thus probably cannot occur in an analo-
gous fashion.

(c) finally, the cytotoxic action of high levels of
 xxxd2725xxx  (6), concentrated by ar in target tissues,
should not be overlooked.

the experiments performed with  xxxd2725xxx  in fig.
3 differ in two respects: the choice of  xxxd387xxx  dose,
which is 50 times higher over the 2-week adminis-
tration schedule in panel b than a and which has
been chosen as a function of the human dose (500
eg s.c. three times a day), and the route of  xxxd2725xxx 
administration: 20 mg orally rather than s.c. the
higher  xxxd387xxx  dose leads to lower lh levels (97):

according to published data, 20 mg  xxxd2725xxx  is vir-
tually as active by the oral as by the s.c. route. how-
ever, surprisingly, whatever the circulating lh and
t concentrations found in these experiments, the
outcome on prostate weight, which falls to the cas-
tration level, is the same, demonstrating that the
 xxxd387xxx  dose can be reduced 50-fold to obtain the
desired effect when it is associated with  xxxd2725xxx .
this is already apparent in the dose-response
curves published elsewhere in this issue (97), which
show that a plateau is obtained from 1! we/day of
 xxxd387xxx .

both of the above experiments on the combina-
tion of ‘‘ xxxd2725xxx  +  xxxd387xxx ’’ record data ob-
tained after 10-14 days of treatment, when lh and
t levels fall as a result of densensitization of lh-
rh receptors. however, the immediate response to
administration of an  xxxg930xxx -a is a rise in lh and
t. this rise leads to a temporary increase in the
prostate weight of the rat, which is, however, not
observed in the presence of  xxxd2725xxx  (96,97). thus,
the peripheral antiandrogenic action of  xxxd2725xxx  on
the prostate is sufficiently powerful to prevent the

evidence for the antihormonal activity of the
antiandrogen

the antiandrogenic activity of  xxxd2725xxx  in the
human has been demonstrated in noncastrated
male-to-female transsexuals with normal male sec-
ondary sex characteristics and normal hormone lev-
els (118) and also in females (119). in males, an-
andron (2 x 150 mg daily) increased basal lh and
t levels by lifting the androgen block on the hy-
pothalamopituitary unit and progressively enhanced
the response to  xxxg930xxx  (100 wg) stimulation over
the first 6 weeks of treatment (118). there was no
effect on fsh production, but prolactin increased
slightly. no change in prostate volume or diameter
was observed at the end of 8 weeks of treatment
(120,121).

like  xxxd2725xxx ,  xxxd2143xxx  (750 mg) increases
basal lh and t levels but decreases stimulated lh
levels after gnrh (122). in eugonadal men, en-
hanced spontaneous lh pulsatility occurred with
no changes in exogenous gnrh-stimulated lh re-
lease (123). there are conflicting reports on cpa
activity. lh levels can be either normal or reduced.
whereas t levels are virtually always depressed.
the pituitary response to gnrh ts reduced by 100
mg cpa as it is by 750 mg  xxxd2143xxx  (122).

clinical pharmacology studies with the
combination of ‘‘antiandrogen +  xxxg930xxx -a”’

results of the experiments in rats indicate that
enhanced activity can be obtained with the combi-
nation of ‘“‘ xxxd2725xxx  +  xxxd387xxx ’’ vs.  xxxd387xxx 
alone via at least two mechanisms: (a) a central po-
tentiation mechanism, and (b) a peripheral antian-
drogen action whereby  xxxd2725xxx  opposes the ef-
fects on the prostate of any residual t due to
incomplete castration by the  xxxg930xxx -a. of any
bioactive androgen metabolite originating from ad-
renal precursors, and of a temporary increase in t
at initiation of  xxxg930xxx -a treatment.

we have shown that, following orchiectomy of
prostate cancer patients, a much higher percentage
(30%) of 3a- xxxd175xxx  glucuronide is detected
in plasma than normally expected on the basis of
the residual t (5%) and dht (10%) plasma levels
(18). this glucuronide could originate from the con-
version of adrenal androgens into dht by the pros-
tate. geller’s work (12,.13,124) has indeed estab-
lished that as much as 1.16 ng of dht/g prostate
are still present after orchiectomy and 0.81 ng/g
after combined estrogen and ma treatment and that
these very low dht levels are correlated to psa
concentrations. it is now common knowledge that
the first 2-6 days of treatment with an  xxxg930xxx -a
are associated with an elevation in serum t and a
simultaneous elevation in prostatic acid phospha-
tase (pap). often accompanied by increased bone
pain (disease flare). the increases were of 50% in
t and 20% in pap in six patients receiving  xxxd387xxx 
intranasally (125). on the basis of the data in the

rat. this biological response should be blocked by
the antiandrogen. confirmation of the enhanced ac-
tivity of the combination of ‘‘ xxxd2725xxx  + busere-
lin’’ was thus sought in clinical pharmacology stud-
ics in patients with stages c and d prostate cancer.

the first studies (126~128) soon revealed that, in
spite of the increased lh and t levels recorded at
initiation of treatment, the serum pap levels de-
clined immediately in a majority of patients, as il-
lustrated by the results for four individual patients
in fig. 5 (127). this observation has been recently
confirmed in a double-blind randomized study (129)
in stage d patients comparing ‘“‘ xxxd387xxx  + pla-
cebo™ and “ xxxd387xxx  +  xxxd2725xxx ™ where the an-
andron dose was no longer split into three daily in-
takes of 100 mg because of intervening knowledge
on the long half-life of the drug (130-133). in spite
of the high lh and t levels, pap and psa were
reduced much faster in the patients receiving an-
andron and underwent less fluctuation. increases in
bone pain were less frequent with the combination.
no true difference, however. was noted in the am-
plitude and timing of the t peak. we could have
expected on the basis of the enhanced response to
 xxxg930xxx  stimulation observed in transsexuals that
 xxxd2725xxx  might desensitize the pituitary faster and
advance the peak more markedly, but for this the
suprapharmacological dose of  xxxd387xxx  would
probably have to be considerably reduced, as sug-
gested by the results of the animal studies. at the
doses used, both drugs are acting at maximum ca-
pacity at the central level and any synergy is difficult
to detect.

analysis of the levels of the other hormones that
were assayed in the course of the study is in
progress. preliminary observations suggest a de-
crease in a4-androstenedione under  xxxd2725xxx  treat-
ment, which implies interference with the metabolic
pathways of t biosynthesis as observed in in vitro
studies on rat testicular microsomes (66) and in as-
says performed during long-term treatment with an-
andron in orchiectomized patients (134).

with regard to the decrease in pap,  xxxd2143xxx  at
a dose of 750 mg gave similar results to  xxxd2725xxx 
(135,136). the pap levels were not as low with cpa
and, surprisingly, in spite of the expected pituitary
inhibition, t levels were higher in the presence than
absence of cpa (137). in fact, pituitary inhibition
by cpa most often results in a delay in the ap-
pearance of the t peak rather than in its complete
suppression. a comparison of the three drugs is
given in fig. 6. which represents data extracted
from refs. 129, 135, and 137.

some authors have considered administration of
the antiandrogen as a lead-in to  xxxg930xxx -a therapy.
 xxxd2143xxx  has been given 24 h before the analog
(135) and cpa | week before (138). kinetic studies
have shown that the half-lives of these antiandro-
gens are very different. those of  xxxd2143xxx  and of its
active metabolite. hydroxyflutamide, being very
much shorter (132). consequently, times to reach
the steady-state differ and it may be logical to as-
sume that a high concentration of active drug is nec-
essary to obtain an effective response. in the case
of  xxxd2725xxx . the steady state is reached within ap-
proximately 2 weeks (131-133) as confirmed by

a dose of 3 x 0.5 mg s.c. for 7 days followed by 3 x 0.4 mg daily intranasally. the
data are extracted from a comparison with 58 patients treated with  xxxd387xxx  alone

of 250 mg orally every 8 h (135). right panel: 17 patients with previously untreated

in a randomized double-blind study vs. “‘ xxxd387xxx  + placebo”’ (19 patients). plasma
samples were collected every day for 2 weeks, then on days 18, 22, and 29. serum
pap and prostatic-specific antigen (psa) levels were measured as well as the con-
centration of 10 hormones, of testosterone binding globulin ( xxxg2066xxx ), and of active
drug. for the purposes of the comparison with panels a and b, only the results for
antiandrogen-treated patients are represented here and only data for 6 out of the 18

time points (129).

radioimmunoassays of the drug during the above
double-blind clinical pharmacology study (fig. 7),
and yet. pap and psa levels decreased immediately
when less than half-maximal drug levels had been
attained. this demonstrates the potency of the drug
and also lends justification to the lower administra-
tion schedule of 150 mg rather than 300 mg daily as
marketed in france, although a dose of 300 mg is
still recommended during the first month to ensure
that sufficiently high  xxxd2725xxx  plasma levels are
reached fast enough. moreover. in view of the dem-
onstrated activity of  xxxd2725xxx , the need for the high
doses of  xxxg930xxx -a that will subsequently depress
t to castrate levels is not proven. the choice of a
temporarily higher  xxxd2725xxx  dose may be prefera-
ble to a lead-in treatment in view of accumulating
evidence on the importance of an instantaneous im-
pact on both t synthesis and action.

clinical trials with the combination of
**antiandrogen +  xxxg930xxx -a”’

the clinical pharmacology studies we performed
in collaboration with labrie (126-128) were not de-
signed to evaluate long-term efficacy. however, the
preliminary results on disease regression in a study
on 35 patients treated with the combination were so
encouraging that they called for confirmation even
though the results of another study, limited to just
five patients receiving analogous therapy. were dis-
appointing (139). several randomized studies were
therefore set up using different  xxxg930xxx -a and an-
tiandrogens. in the first studies on  xxxd2725xxx , the
antiandrogen was associated with surgical castra-
tion. significant improvements have been recorded
over orchiectomy alone in double-blind studies now
totaling 142  xxxd2725xxx -treated and 162 placebo pa-
tients (table 1) (140-145). labrie switched to the

response of 14% in the ‘‘ xxxd387xxx  + placebo”
group compared to just 8% in the “‘ xxxd387xxx  + an-
andron’”’ group. in patients with bone pain from me-
tastases, the visit at month | established an increase
in bone pain in six patients receiving ‘“‘ xxxd387xxx  +
placebo’? whereas no patient receiving ‘‘ xxxd387xxx 
+  xxxd2725xxx ’”’ complained of such an increase. this
clinical observation confirms the important role of
 xxxd2725xxx  in controlling the  xxxg930xxx -a induced dis-
ease flare. results on the best objective response
recorded at any 6-month visit during treatment and
evaluated according to npcp criteria, time to pro-
gression, and the number of deaths due to cancer
are summarized in table 2. in this study on only a
limited number of patients,  xxxd2725xxx  increased the
regression rate and delayed progression. a trial into
which 410 patients are being entered is presently
underway and the first results should be available
in december 1989.

in the course of a randomized double-blind study
evaluating the benefit of adding  xxxd2725xxx  to or-
chiectomy, an arm “‘ xxxd387xxx  +  xxxd2725xxx ’’ was
included for those patients who refused surgical cas-
tration (141,142). although the results of all arms
are not comparable according to strict statistical
standards, they should not be disregarded from a
scientific viewpoint since there were no differences
in protocol criteria and analysis nor in the handling
of patients during follow-up. a brief synopsis of the

am j clin oncol (cct), vol. 11, suppl. 2, 1988

recently updated results is given in table 3. what-
ever the parameter under consideration (best re-
sponse to treatment, time to progression, or time to
death by cancer), the combined treatment of an an-
tiandrogen plus  xxxg930xxx -a gives a substantially im-
proved result, thus, in our mind, validating our in-
itial hypotheses (149). a dose-ranging study is now
called for, which could use the pap and/or psa
response during the first month as a yardstick, in
order to determine to what extent the  xxxg930xxx -a
dose can be decreased, as indicated by the animal
studies.

the results of clinical trials using other products
have recently been communicated. in one study of
605 eligible patients (150,151), 304 and 301 were ran-
domly allocated to ‘‘leuprolide +  xxxd2143xxx ’’ and
‘leuprolide + placebo,’’ respectively. response
rates were comparable for both arms. the estimate
of median time to progression for the combined
treatment group was 16.2 months and for “‘leuprol-
ide + placebo” was 13.8 months. the difference in
the distribution of time to progression was statisti-
cally significant (log rank p level = 0.028) but sur-
 xxxd1866xxx  curves were virtually identical.

a third  xxxg930xxx -a under study in a combined pro-
tocol is zoladex, which is administered in a depot
form (3.6 ng s.c.) every 4 weeks. the combined
treatment (zoladex +  xxxd2143xxx ) is compared to zo-
ladex alone in one instance (152) and to surgical
castration in another (153). results are pending.

the majority of these protocols have not been
designed to assess true differences in survival re-
sulting from administration of active drug since, at
the time of disease progression, patients initially on
placebo are assigned to receive the drug. the results
thus tend to reflect the difference between early and
late administration, a notwithstanding important
point since preliminary data in the  xxxd2725xxx  studies
indicate than an immediate total androgen blockade
is more effective than delayed antiandrogen admin-
istration and that the delay should be less than 2
days (140). already, all trials concord in the con-
clusion that antiandrogens are less effective in pa-
tients who have received prior endocrine therapy,
but now the added notion that antiandrogen action
should be as immediate as possible is gaining
ground.

conclusion

in the above analysis of the characteristics of the
combination of antiandrogens and castration, one
important point has emerged. all methods of de-
antiandrogens +  xxxg930xxx  analogues

pressing t are not equivalent nor are all antiandro-
gens. the analysis has been primarily focused on
the combination of a nonsteroid antiandrogen with
an  xxxg930xxx -a although other combinations involv-
ing the use of orchiectomy, estrogens, inhibitors of
adrenal steroid biosynthesis, and steroid antiandro-
gens have been envisaged by others as well as by
us.

in our opinion, the chosen combination of a non-
steroid antiandrogen and a  xxxg930xxx -a presents
many advantages: (a) it avoids the psychological
stress of orchiectomy. (b) the treatment is revers-
ible in the short term, enabling rapid identification
of the population that will not respond to endocrine
treatment. inception of alternative therapies is thus
not unnecessarily delayed. (c) better tolerance is
associated with the use of an  xxxg930xxx -a to depress
t than with the use of estrogens, which have known
cardiovascular complications, and with adrenal bio-
synthesis inhibitors, which require corticoid re-
placement therapy. (d) the nonsteroid antiandrogen
counteracts the action on the prostate of any bioac-
tive androgen, whatever its origin (residual testic-
ular secretion or adrenal precursors). (e) the non-
steroid antiandrogen and  xxxg930xxx -a potentiate each
other’s action, thus suggesting that their doses could
be decreased. this could mean improved tolerance
and lower cost. such potentiation is not observed
with steroid antiandrogens.

the detailed and rapid analysis of all of the pa-
rameters recorded in ongoing studies on the com-
bination of ‘‘nonsteroid antiandrogen +  xxxg930xxx -
a”’ should help to identify those patients who re-
spond best and to elaborate the design of future
trials. €
