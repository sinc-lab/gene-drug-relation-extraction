1. introduction
propoxyphene is a synthetic opioid analgesic that is
frequently implicated in fatal drug overdose. propoxyphene (p) is a relatively weak m-opioid receptor agonist
with an analgesic potency 20 to 40 times less than that of
(2)methadone [1]. toxic blood concentrations ranging
from 3 to 180 mmol / l have been reported [2] and it is
known that norpropoxyphene (np), a major metabolite of
p, accumulates in cardiac tissue and may cause cardiac
toxicity [3]. while symptoms of central nervous system
depression, i.e., coma, convulsions and respiratory depression can be reversed by opiate antagonists, cardiotoxic
effects remain unaffected by naloxone administration and
therefore, may be unrelated to opioid receptor occupancy

by p and np. for instance, various naloxone-insensitive
cardiovascular effects associated with p poisoning have
been particularly well documented and include bradycardia, asystole, bundle branch block, widening of qrs
complex, reduced myocardial contractility and hypotension
[4]. in several cases the mechanism underlying the nonopioid action of opioid agonists has been shown to involve
a direct interaction between the drug and voltage-dependent na 1 channels. whitcomb et al. [5] demonstrated that
p and np block ina in a manner similar to local anesthetics, exhibiting both use dependency and slow recovery
from block. whitcomb et al. further demonstrated that the
empirically observed reversal of qrs widening by administration of lidocaine, a local anesthetic, was caused by
an increase of recovery from ina block by p. it was
concluded that lidocaine is clinically effective at reversing
time for primary review 15 days.

objective: norpropoxyphene (np) is a major metabolite of propoxyphene (p), a relatively weak m-opioid receptor agonist. toxic
blood concentrations ranging from 3 to 180 mmol / l have been reported and the accumulation of np in cardiac tissue leads to
naloxone-insensitive cardiotoxicity. since several lines of evidence suggest that not only block of ina but also ik block may contribute to
the non-opioid cardiotoxic effects of p and np, we investigated the effects of p and np on herg channels. herg presumably encodes
ikr , the rapidly-activating delayed rectifier k 1 current, which is known to have an important role in initiating repolarization of action
potentials in cardiac myocytes. methods: using the 2-microelectrode voltage clamp technique we investigated the interaction of p and
np with herg channels, expressed in xenopus oocytes. results: our experiments show that low drug concentrations (5 mmol / l)
facilitate herg currents, while higher drug concentrations block herg currents (ic 50 -values of approx. 40 mmol / l) and dramatically
shift the reversal potential to a more positive value because of a 30-fold increased na 1 -permeability. p and np also alter gating of herg
channels by slowing down channel activation and accelerating channel deactivation kinetics. the mutant s631c nullifies the effect of p
and np on the channel’s k 1 -selectivity. conclusion: p and np show a complex and unique drug-channel interaction, which includes
altering ion-selectivity and gating. site-directed mutagenesis suggests that an interaction with s631 contributes to the drug-induced
disruption of k 1 -selectivity. no specific role of the mink subunit in the herg block mechanism could be determined.  1999 elsevier

2. materials and methods

2.1. expression in oocytes
the human mink (hisk) cdna clone in its original
vector, pbluescript (stratagene, usa), was first sub-

cloned into our custom-made high expression vector,
pgemhe [16], by double restriction digest of both
pgemhe and hisk / pbluescript with kpni and psti.
both cdnas were loaded on an agarose gel, fragments of
interest were cut out and genecleaned (qiagen, usa) for
ligation with t4 dna ligase (promega, usa). for in vitro
transcription, the ligation product, hisk / pgemhe, was
linearized with psti. cdna encoding the human herg
channel (herg / psp64) was linearized with ecori. next
the crnas were synthesized from the linearized plasmids
using the ‘ribomax large scale rna production system’
(promega, usa) with t7 rna polymerase (for hisk /
pgemhe) or sp6 rna polymerase (herg / psp64) in
the presence of a cap analogue diguanosine triphosphate
(boehringer, germany). the hergs631c mutant in its
original vector, palter (promega, usa), was first
subcloned into pgemhe. the hergs631c clone was
isolated by a double restriction digest with ecori and xbai
and ligated into the corresponding sites of pgemhe. the
ligation product, hergs631c / pgemhe, was linearized
with xbai and capped crna was synthesized using largescale t7 mmessage mmachine transcription kit
(ambion, usa). the in vitro synthesis of crna encoding
rck1 and isolation of xenopus laevis oocytes was as
previously described [16]. oocytes were injected with
herg or hergs631c crna at a concentration of 5
ng / 50 nl. hisk was coinjected with herg at a final
concentration of 2.5 ng / 50 nl each.

2.2. electrophysiological recordings and analysis
whole-cell currents from oocytes were recorded from 1
to 4 days after injection using the two microelectrode
voltage clamp technique (geneclamp 500, axon instruments, usa). resistances of voltage and current electrodes
were kept as low as possible (approx. 200 kv) and were
filled with 3 mol / l kcl. currents were filtered at 200 hz,
using a 4-pole low-pass bessel filter. capacitative and leak
currents were not subtracted. to eliminate the effect of the
voltage drop across the bath grounding electrode, the bath
potential was actively controlled. all experiments were
performed at room temperature (19–238c). the oocytes
were superfused with nd-96 solution (composition in
mmol / l: kcl 2, nacl 96, mgcl 2 1,  xxxg2125xxx  2 1.8, hepes 5,
ph 7.5). for incubation of oocytes, this solution was
supplemented with 50 mg / l  xxxd2193xxx . in ion
substitution experiments solutions containing different kcl
concentrations (0.25–98 mmol / l) were obtained by substitution of kcl for nacl. na 1 -free conditions were obtained
by substitution of na 1 for tris. the pclamp program
was used for data acquisition and data files (axon instruments, usa) were directly imported, analysed and visualised with a custom made add-in for microsoft excel. the
percentage reduced current was calculated using the equation:

some non-opioid receptor mediated effects (qrs widening
and bradycardia) and that the cardiotoxicity of p may be
attributed, in part, to block of the na 1 channel pore.
in addition, several lines of evidence suggest that not
only block of ina but also ik block may contribute to the
non-opioid cardiotoxic effects of p and np. horrigan and
gilly [6] demonstrated that methadone and p block k 1
channels in squid neurons and gh3 cells and that this
effect, at least in case of p poisoning, contributes to the
cardiotoxic effects. pugsley et al. [7,8] showed that the
antiarrhythmic actions of several k-opioid receptor agonists, including u50488h, are associated with block of
voltage-activated na 1 and k 1 currents in isolated rat
cardiac myocytes.
because the effects of p and np on cloned cardiac k 1
channels are unknown, we investigated the effects of p and
np on ikr , the rapidly-activating delayed rectifier k 1
current, which is known to have an important role in
initiating repolarization of action potentials in cardiac
myocytes. the gene encoding the ikr current was initially
identified by warmke and ganetzky [9] as the human
ether-a-go-go-related gene (herg). while the inherited
long qt syndrome (lqts), an autosomal dominant disease, has been linked to mutations in the herg gene, the
acquired form of lqts can result from therapy with drugs
that block herg channels. this interaction with herg
channels is considered as the main mechanism underlying
the potential cardiotoxic effects caused by a variety of
drugs, including second-generation h 1 antihistamines
( xxxd236xxx  [10] and terfenadine [11]), the neuroleptic drug
haloperidol [12] and the antidepressant thioridazine [13].
lqts is associated with syncope and sudden death caused
by abnormal repolarization and the onset of a rare but
life-threatening polymorphic ventricular tachycardia
known as torsade de pointes. because a contribution of the
mink subunit to herg channel regulation [14] and
pharmacological properties [15] has been reported, we
investigated the effects of p and np not only on herg
but also on herg1mink currents. in vitro synthesized
crnas were injected into xenopus laevis oocytes and the
effects of p and np were compared by means of the two
microelectrode voltage clamp technique.
in this study, we demonstrate that p and np show
affinity for the herg cardiac k 1 channels at concentrations similar to those reported in p-induced fatalities.
we therefore conclude that a drug–herg interaction, at
least in part, may contribute to the cardiotoxic effects of p
and np.

to investigate the effect of p and np on herg and

and currents were investigated 2 to 4 days postinjection by
means of the two microelectrode voltage clamp technique.

herg1mink currents. the time course for activation
currents at 210 mv were fitted with a single exponential
function and the calculated time constant for activation (t )
was 714.18636.81 ms (n54) for herg currents and
764.90644.99 (n54) for herg1mink currents. currents
evoked from a holding potential of 270 mv, pulsed to
120 mv during 2 s and stepped to tail potentials ranging
from 2120 to 230 mv in 10 mv increments, showed
inward rectification as illustrated in fig. 1c and 1d. the
calculated erev was 289.4560.09 mv (n56) for herg
currents and 288.1260.08 mv (n56) for herg1mink
currents. the fast (t2 ) and slow (t1 ) component of deactivation were resolved with a biexponential time fit of tail
currents elicited at 270 mv, after a 2 s test pulse to 140
mv. t2 was 246.01621.12 ms (n53) for herg currents
and 243.53647.22 ms (n53) for herg1mink currents,

and 974.136120.94 ms (n53) for herg1mink currents.

were constructed with normalized peak tail amplitudes
obtained after application of 100 mmol / l p and 125 mmol /
l np (fig. 2c and d). v1 / 2 was shifted to more depolarized
potentials by p (v1 / 2 5 218.8061.14 mv, n53 for herg
currents and v1 / 2 5 215.3660.56 mv, n53 for  xxxg1246xxx 
mink currrents) and np (v1 / 2 5 214.8061.98 mv, n54
for herg currents and v1 / 2 5 210.5161.62 mv, n54 for
herg1mink currrents).

3.3. effect of p and np on channel gating
characteristics
the effect of p and np on herg and herg1mink
current activation and deactivation kinetics was analyzed
by application of 2 s test pulses to 210 mv from a holding
potential of 270 mv. tail currents were clamped at 270
mv. experiments show that increasing concentrations of p
and np not only decreased current activation rate constants
but also increased deactivation rate constants (fig. 3a, c
and d). the time course of herg1mink current activation was characterized by a time constant (t ) of
946.36620.29 ms (n53) after application of 125 mmol / l
np and 1039.21645.99 ms (n54) after application of 100
mmol / l p. herg1mink tail currents evoked after application of 125 mmol / l np (n53) were fitted with a
biexponential function and a t2 -value (fast deactivation
phase) of 69.4064.53 ms and a t1 -value (slow deactivation
phase) of 292.77654.32 were calculated. t2 and t1 -values
after application of 100 mmol / l p (n53) were
103.6168.25 ms and 391.67643.71 ms, respectively.
similar results were obtained for herg currents (data not
shown). the effects of other concentrations tested on
herg1mink current activation and deactivation are
summarized in fig. 3c and 3d, respectively. for comparison we analyzed the effect of 125 mmol / l np on
rck1 ( xxxg1229xxx ), another voltage-dependent k 1 channel
with 6 transmembrane regions but characterized by delayed outward rectification (fig. 3b). here, deactivation
rate constants of rck1 tail currents decreased by drug
application, resulting in a cross-over phenomenon which is
different from the one observed on herg and  xxxg1246xxx 
mink current after application of 5 mmol / l p and np. this
effect was not further investigated since it was not
considered relevant for the cardiotoxicity of these drugs.

3.4. drug-induced changes of the reversal potential
when p and np were applied at the highest concentration tested, 1000 mmol / l and 250 mmol / l respectively, the outwardly deactivating tail current, seen in control
conditions, was switched to an inwardly deactivating tail
current (fig. 4a), although the tail was clamped 270 mv,
a value more positive than erev (approx. 289 mv in 2
mmol / l [k 1 ] o ). to analyze the effect on erev , tail currents
were studied at tail potentials ranging from 2120 to 230

in a first series of experiments 2 s test pulses ranging
from 250 to 140 mv were applied in 10 mv increments
from a holding potential of 270 mv and the effect of 5
mmol / l p and np was investigated. a steady-state facilitation of herg and herg1mink currents was observed
on currents evoked during test and tail pulses, with an
effect most pronounced on the peak of the tail current (fig.
2a). facilitation of herg and herg1mink currents in
the presence of p amounted 133.2465.89% (n54) and
136.6862.42% (n54), respectively as calculated on the
peak of the tail current which was clamped at 270 mv
after a 2 s test pulse to 140 mv. 100% was taken as the
control current level. similarly, the calculated facilitation
for np was 132.14067.43% (n54) on herg currents and
140.1965.58% (n54) on herg1mink currents. furthermore, a cross-over phenomenon of the currents during the
tail pulse was observed, caused by a combination of the
agonistic effect and an increase of the deactivation rate, as
will be reported in the next section.
in a second series of experiments the effects of higher
concentrations p (50 and 100 mmol / l) and np (50 and 125
mmol / l) were investigated under the same conditions.
after application of 50 mmol / l of p or np, a small level of
block was observed on activating currents, with no significant effect on the peak of the tail amplitude. more
importantly, the deactivation rate was further increased as
illustrated in fig. 2b. 100 mmol / l p and 125 mmol / l np
caused a steady-state block of herg currents
(36.2169.53%, n54 for p and 33.7764.18%, n54 for
np) and herg1mink currents (42.8164.31%, n54 for
p and 37.39610.68%, n54 for np) as measured on the
peak of the tail current. this effect was partially reversible

was shifted to more depolarized potentials by p3 (v1 / 2 5 218.8061.14 mv for herg currents and v1 / 2 5 215.3660.56 mv for herg1mink currrents)
and np3 (v1 / 2 5 214.8061.98 mv for herg currents and v1 / 2 5 210.5161.62 mv for herg1mink currrents).

mv in 10 mv increments, after a 2 s test pulse to 120 mv.
the application of 250 mmol / l np shifted the erev of
herg and herg1mink currents to 260.3064.54 mv
(n54) and 259.7664.36 mv (n54), respectively. the
effect of other concentrations on the erev of herg and
herg1mink currents is summarized in fig. 4b. similar
results were obtained for p (erev 5 277.7363.30 mv, n54
after application of 100 mmol / l). in contrast, no effect of p
and np on the erev of rck1 currents could be observed
(fig. 4b). uninjected oocytes were analyzed under the
same conditions as herg currents and no inward currents
could be observed upon application of 250 mmol / l np
(n54, data not shown).

to elucidate the cause of the shift of erev to more
depolarized potentials we investigated the effect of np on
the erev in external nd-96 solutions containing different
concentrations of kcl (0.25–98 mmol / l, fig. 4c). in
absence of the drug, the erev varied over the entire range of
extracellular k 1 concentrations in a manner well described
by the goldman–hodgkin–katz current equation [17,18].
we calculated that herg1mink in control is selectively
permeable to k 1 over na 1 by a factor of 75.2. when the
erev was determined under the same experimental conditions, but in presence of 250 mmol / l np, the k 1 over
na 1 permeability was 2.5, meaning a 30-fold increase of
the na 1 -permeability. to confirm that the shift of the erev

constants and increases deactivation rate constants. in contrast, the same concentration of np on rck1 ( xxxg1229xxx ), another voltage-dependent k 1 channel
with 6 transmembrane regions but characterized by delayed outward rectification, caused a decreased deactivation rate (panel b), resulting in a cross-over
phenomenon which is different from the one shown in fig. 2a. dashed lines indicate the zero current level. panels c and d summarize the effect of
increasing concentrations np on activating and deactivating time constants for herg1mink currents, respectively. activating currents were fitted to a
single exponential function, while the fast (t2 , h) and slow (t1 , j) component of deactivating currents were resolved with a biexponential time fit.

is caused by an increased na 1 -permeability, we determined the erev in na 1 -free solutions (na 1 substituted for
tris) supplemented with varying concentrations of kcl,
in absence and presence of 250 mmol / l np. indeed, no
effect of np on the erev in na 1 -free solutions was
observed.

3.5. pharmacology of p and np on hergs631 c mutant
currents of oocytes expressing hergs631c channels
were evoked by application of depolarizing test pulses
ranging from –70 to 150 mv in 10 mv increments, from a
holding potential of –90 mv. tail currents were clamped at
–70 mv. before each experiment, oocytes were treated
with 0.1% h 2 o 2 for 2–5 min. representative traces of
hergs613c currents evoked under these conditions are

illustrated in fig. 5a. hergs631c channels with thiol
groups in oxidized states are characterized by disrupted
1
c-type inactivation and k -selectivity, as very recently
described by fan et al. [25]. unlike wt herg channels,
mutant channels display inwardly activating currents at test
potentials more negative than 0 mv and outwardly rectifying currents at test potentials more positive than 0 mv. tail
currents inwardly deactivate at –70 mv. erev was determined by clamping tail currents at potentials ranging
from –90 to 120 mv in 10 mv increments, after a 1 s test
pulse to 140 mv. under control conditions (fig. 5b), erev
was –1.6764.77 mv (n56), consistent with the low k 1 selectivity of hergs631c channels. upon application of
250 mmol / l np, no change of erev could be observed
(n54, fig. 5c). similar results were obtained upon
application of 250 mmol / l p (n54, data not shown).

fig. 4. panel a: a 2 s test pulse to 120 mv was applied from a holding potential of 270 mv. the outwardly deactivating herg1mink tail current was
‘switched’ to an inwardly deactivating tail current after application of 250 mmol / l np ( xxxg1855xxx  ), although the tail current was clamped at 270 mv, a value
more positive than erev (approx. 289 mv in 2 mmol / l [k 1 ] o . the dashed line indicates the zero current level. panel b summarizes the effect of increasing
concentrations of np on the erev of herg (j) and herg1mink (h) currents, measured in 2 mmol / l [k 1 ] o . interestingly, 250 mmol / l np did not
significantly affect the erev of rck1 currents (n). panel c: the erev was measured in external solutions containing different concentrations k 1 in the
absence (s) and in the presence of 250 mmol / l np (– n –). data points from both conditions were fitted with the goldman–hodgkin–katz current
equation. the calculated k 1 over na 1 permeability factor was 75.2 in control conditions and 2.5 in presence of 250 mmol / l np, meaning a 30-fold
increase of the na 1 -permeability. the erev was also determined in external na 1 -free solutions (na 1 substituted for tris) containing different
concentrations k 1 (d). the erev , measured in tris solution, was not significantly changed in the presence of 250 mmol / l np (m). the dashed curve was
drawn according to the nernst equation (58 mv/ decade), indicating the relation for a perfectly selective k 1 channel.

3.6. concentration–response curves
taking into account the multitude of effects described
above, the use of peak tail current amplitudes (fig. 6, open
symbols) to construct a concentration–response relation-

ship was not satisfactory. for instance, a hill curve would
have to be constructed using a combination of current
percentage values higher than 100% at 5 mmol / l (due to
facilitation) and negative percentages at the highest drug
concentration (due to inward tail currents). therefore,

k 1 -selectivity of hergs631c channels. panel c: in contrast to wt herg channels, application of 250 mmol / l np caused no change of erev (n54). the
dashed line indicates the zero current level. currents shown in panel a were corrected by off-line linear leak subtraction. statistical analysis revealed no
significant difference of time constants describing the deactivation process in the absence and presence of drug.

concentration–response curves were constructed using tail
current amplitudes, measured at 3500 ms at 270 mv (fig.
6, filled symbols). we calculated that herg currents are
blocked by p and np with an ic 50 -value of 44.7064.19
mmol / l (n54) and 33.2064.36 mmol / l, (n54) respectively. the hill coefficients were 1.1660.15 and 1.0360.06,
respectively. the calculated ic 50 -values for herg1mink
blockade are 40.9266.54 mmol / l (n53) and 40.15611.91
mmol / l (n54), respectively, with hill coefficients of
1.0360.04 and 1.2160.27, respectively. statistical analyses revealed no significant difference (p50.05) between
affinity of p and np for herg channel block and no role
of the mink subunit could be determined.

4. discussion
it has been reported that a variety of drugs, including
psychotropic drugs, exert their cardiotoxic effect by herg
channel blockade and cause an excessive prolongation of
action potentials, leading to an acquired form of the lqts,
which can degenerate in fatal torsade de pointes. propoxyphene (p) is often implicated in fatal drug poisoning and
several lines of evidence suggest that not only ina but also
ik block may contribute to its naloxone-insensitive cardiotoxic effects. since it is not known which k 1 current is
affected by p in native cells and since ikr is a principal
repolarizing current in cardiac myocytes, we investigated

the effects of p and np on the herg channel. in addition,
we determined whether the mink subunit contributed to
pharmacological characteristics. abbott et al. [19] have
shown very recently that mixed complexes of  xxxg1246xxx 
mirp1 (kcne2) resemble distinctive biphasic inhibition
by the class iii antiarrhytmic e-4031, as observed with
native ikr , unlike channels formed only with herg or
herg1mink ( xxxg1245xxx ). therefore, a possible role for
mirp1 might exist for the herg block mechanism by p
and np.
in the present study, we demonstrated that a concen-

fig. 6. concentration–response relationships for the inhibitory effect of p
and np on herg (panel a) and herg1mink currents (panel b). the
effect on the peak of the tail current is indicated for p (n) and np (h),
as well as at 3500 ms, for p (m) and np (j), respectively. the inhibited
current was expressed as the percentage inhibition / control current and the
calculated curves have been drawn according to a standard logistic
equation. we calculated that herg currents are blocked by p and np
with an ic 50 -value of 44.7064.19 mmol / l and 33.2064.36 mmol / l,
respectively. the hill coefficients were 1.1660.15 and 1.0360.06,
respectively. the calculated ic 50 -values for herg1mink blockade are
40.9266.54 mmol / l and 40.15611.91 mmol / l, respectively, with hill
coefficients of 1.0360.04 and 1.2160.27, respectively. statistical analyses revealed no significant difference (p50.05) between affinity of p and
np for herg channel block and no role of the mink subunit could be
determined.

tration of 5 mmol / l p and np causes a steady-state
facilitation of herg and herg1mink currents. kinetic
analysis revealed that the same concentration decreases
channel activation rate constants and increases channel
deactivation rate constants, thereby causing a cross-over
phenomenon of the tail currents. a similar effect on ito
deactivation kinetics in rat ventricular myocytes by application of micromolar concentrations of naloxone, a nonselective opioid antagonist, was recently reported [20].
holland and steinberg [21] previously reported that
superfusion with 3 mmol / l p and np changes conducting
characteristics of canine purkinje fibers in the heart, by
decreasing the maximal rate of rise of the action potential
upstroke and decreasing the total action potential duration
and cellular refractoriness. while the initial effect on the
depolarization phase can be explained by block of ina , the
shortening of the repolarization phase correlates remarkably well with our finding that ikr is facilitated, since a
drug-induced increase of k 1 efflux will return the membrane potential faster to its resting potential. furthermore,
preliminary experiments in our laboratory show that p and
np cause a similar agonistic effect on iks , the slowlyactivating delayed rectifier k 1 current, which is regulated
by coassembly of  xxxg1268xxx  and mink. in contrast, the
inwardly rectifying k 1 channel irk1 remains unaffected,
while the g protein coupled inwardly rectifying k 1
channel (girk) is blocked by application of 5 mmol / l p
[22].
horrigan and gilly [23] recently demonstrated that drug
concentrations achieved in mammals during p poisoning
are sufficient to block k 1 channels in squid neurons and
gh3 cells with a kd of 32 mmol / l. it was proposed that ik
is blocked by diffusion of the non-protonated form of the
drug into the cytoplasm and occlusion of the open k 1
channel at the internal quaternary ammonium (qa) site by
the protonated form of the drug. we calculated that p and
np block herg currents with an ic 50 -value of approx. 40
mmol / l, using current amplitudes measured at 3500 ms.
no role of the mink subunit could be determined. kinetic
analysis revealed that p and np influence channel gating
by decreasing channel activation rate constants and increasing channel deactivation rate constants. boltzmann
activation curves constructed, using normalized peak tail
amplitudes before and after application of 100 mmol / l p
and 125 mmol / l np, revealed that the v1 / 2 was shifted to
more depolarized potentials by p and np. a previous study
on canines showed that a steady-state plasma concentration
of 3.7 mmol / l p decreased heart rate, while higher
concentrations increased heart rate and qt c -intervals well
above the control level [21]. therefore, it is plausible to
suggest that the herg channel blockade, which we
observed at high concentrations ($50 mmol / l), contributes
to the observed tachycardiac effects and ecg abnormalities, such as qt-prolongation.
the fact that p and np can facilitate herg and
herg1mink currents at lower concentrations and cause
herg and herg1mink channel block at higher con-

since it has been reported that eag, a k 1 channel with
marked sequence similarities to herg, is permeable to
ca 21 , which was not substituted in the na 1 -free solutions
[24].
from a structural point of view, a very interesting
parallel exists between the drug-induced na 1 -permeability
of the herg pore as seen in our study, and the effect of
outer mouth mutations on herg channel function. indeed,
fan et al. [25] reported very recently that s631k and
s631e mutations disrupted k 1 -selectivity of the herg
pore, a change not seen in t449k or t449e in shaker. the
fact that p and np in our study also disrupted k 1 selectivity of the herg pore, but not of  xxxg1229xxx  (a member
of the shaker-subfamiliy) is in agreement with the structure-function studies by fan et al. [25] and suggests that an
interaction of p and np with s631 might contribute to the
drug-induced alteration of ion-selectivity observed in our
study. to test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects
of p and np on hergs631c channels. under oxidizing
conditions, this mutant is characterized by disrupted ctype inactivation and k 1 -selectivity. application of p and
np did not change erev , indeed suggesting an important
drug interaction with s631.
it is difficult to predict, a priori, how a drug with
combined actions on ina and ikr might affect the cardiac
action potential, resulting in the clinically observed effects.
however, we can conclude from our experiments that 3
drug-induced effects on ikr may contribute to p cardiac
toxicity: concentration-dependent facilitation and block of
herg currents as well as an increase of the na 1 permeability. to our knowledge, this phenomenon has not
been described for any other drug thus far.

fig. 7. effect of 5 mmol / l np on the recovery from inactivation. herg
channels were fully activated by application of 20 s depolarizing test
pulses to –15 mv. a hyperpolarizing step to –100 mv was applied for 25
ms to allow rapid recovery from inactivation. upon repolarization to –15
mv the outward current inactivated again to the same current level as
before the hyperpolarzing step. 5 mmol / l np increases the recovery from
inactivation, without affecting the rate of inactivation. the dashed line
indicates the zero current level.

centrations, raises questions about the mechanism by
which these effects are exerted. we hypothesize that
macroscopic channel block is the result of a drug-induced
shift of the v1 / 2 to more depolarized potentials combined
with a drug-induced change of the ion-selectivity (see
further). we also suggest that the facilitating effect of low
concentrations of p and np can be explained by an
increased rate of recovery from fast inactivation, a decreased rate of fast inactivation or a combination of both.
this conclusion is supported with our finding that the time
to reach the peak tail current amplitude is decreased in the
presence of 5 mmol / l p and np (fig. 2a, inset). additionally, experiments revealed that 5 mmol / l np increased the
recovery from fast inactivation, without any significant
effect on the rate of inactivation (fig. 7).
when p and np were applied at the highest concentration tested, tail currents inwardly deactivated at 270
mv, clearly more positive than the control erev of approx.
290 mv. ion substitution experiments (na 1 for tris)
revealed that this effect is caused by an increased na 1 permeability of herg. using the goldman–hodgkin–
katz current equation [17,18], we calculated a 30-fold
increase of na 1 -permeability when 250 mmol / l np was
applied. although such a high drug concentration might
not be achieved during p poisoning, our experiments show
that lower and toxicologically relevant concentrations of p
and np significantly shift the erev to more depolarized
potentials. therefore, we suggest that the increased na 1 permeability might also contribute to the cardiotoxic
effects. interestingly, in a na 1 -free solution herg still
does not behave as a perfectly k 1 -selective channel as
predicted by the nernst equation. this is not surprising
