permeability transition.

introduction
gold(i)-thiolate drugs are compounds essentially utilized in
the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (kean et al., 1997).
they have also been tested as anticancer agents (simon et al.,
1981). their mode of action involves the control of oxidative
damage (grootveld et al., 1990) and inhibition of several
enzymes or transcription factors (handel et al., 1995; daniel
et al., 1995).
the molecular mechanism of their inhibitory eects was
essentially referred to an interaction with thiol groups with a
reactivity depending on the type of ligand associated with the
gold (crooke & snyder, 1986). a sequential sulfhydryl
exchange mechanism was also postulated to explain the
cellular distribution of aurano®n and related gold complexes
(snyder et al., 1986). however, gold(i) compounds exhibit
also a marked and speci®c reactivity with selenoenzymes such
as glutathione peroxidase (gspx) (chaudieáre & tappel,
1984), iodothyronine deiodinase type i (berry et al., 1991),
and  xxxg1826xxx  (hill et al., 1997; gromer et al.,
1998a, b; smith et al., 1999), an enzyme recently shown to
possess selenium at its catalytic site (tamura & stadtman,
*author for correspondence; e-mail: labbind@civ.bio.unipd.it

1996; zhong et al., 1998). considering glutathione peroxidase, gold(i) derivatives such as aurothiomalate,  xxxd2834xxx  and aurano®n have been shown to exert their
inhibitory action by forming a  xxxd2213xxx -gold(i)-selenocysteine glutathione peroxidase ternary complex (gpxse-ausg) (chaudieáre & tappel, 1984; roberts & shaw, 1998).
 xxxg1826xxx  is present in both the cytosol and
mitochondria (rigobello et al., 1998) where exhibits a
sequence dierent from that of the cytosolic isoform but,
similarly to the latter enzyme, possess selenium at its active
site (lee et al., 1999). selenols are able to bind heavy metals
more eciently than thiols (grootveld et al., 1990) and,
therefore, the selenocysteine of  xxxg1826xxx  appears
as the target of organic gold inhibitors (gromer et al., 1998a;
zhong et al., 1998).
in previous research, it was demonstrated that the redox
state of mitochondrial thiols could control the permeability
of the mitochondrial membranes (bindoli et al., 1997;
kowaltowski et al., 2001). in this respect, the thioredoxin
system present in mitochondria might play a critical role
(wudarczyk et al., 1996; rigobello et al., 1998; kim et al.,
1999). we have previously demonstrated (rigobello et al.,
1999) that  xxxd2404xxx , an inhibitor of thioredoxin

m.p. rigobello et al

reductase (schallreuter & wood, 1989) is very eective in
inducing mitochondrial permeability transition and release of
 xxxg569xxx . similar eects on mitochondrial membranes
permeability increase were observed with arsenite and
arsenicals, heavy and transition metal cations, quinones,
alloxan and sulfhydryl reagents (gunter & pfeier, 1990;
zoratti & szaboá, 1995; sakurai et al., 2001) that are also
inhibitors or substrates of  xxxg1826xxx . in the latter
case they act as electron acceptors (arneâr et al., 1999),
therefore, diverting electrons from  xxxg1826xxx  that
are no longer fed to its natural substrate, thioredoxin.
in the present paper we report evidence that aurano®n is a
potent inducer of mitochondrial permeability transition
possibly referable to its interaction with the mitochondrial
isoform of  xxxg1826xxx .

methods
rat liver mitochondria were isolated with dierential
centrifugation according to myers & slater (1957) using a
medium containing 220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm
edta and 5 mm hepes at ph 7.0. in the homogenization
buer, 1 mm egta was also present but was omitted in the
subsequent washings and in the ®nal resuspension of
mitochondria. mitochondrial proteins were estimated with
the  xxxd2444xxx  procedure (gornall et al., 1949). mitochondrial
matrix was prepared from mitochondrial suspension
(60 mg ml71 in 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5) subjected to
freezing and thawing (three times) followed by 30 s of
sonication (twice) and 45 min of centrifugation at
100,0006g. supernatant was dialyzed overnight against the
same buer, in order to remove glutathione, and concentrated in a pressure dialysis system using an amicon ym10
membrane. rat liver mitochondria  xxxg1826xxx  was
prepared and assayed as described by rigobello et al. (1998)
and its protein content was measured according to lowry et
al. (1951).  xxxg981xxx  was assayed according to
carlberg & mannervik (1985). mitochondrial swelling was
followed spectrophotometrically by the decrease in absorbance at 540 nm (lehninger, 1962). membrane potential was
assessed by measuring the movements of tpp+ (tetraphenylphosphonium ion) across the mitochondrial membrane with a
tpp+ selective electrode (kamo et al., 1979). the ordinate
dc values of the curves were recalculated from the
experimental values in order to obtain a linear scale. oxygen
uptake was measured polarographically utilizing a clark-type
oxygen electrode (estabrook, 1967) inserted in a waterjacketed chamber (258c) with constant stirring; the system
was connected to a personal computer (cazzaro et al., 1996).
the data obtained from the various experiments and
generated via the spectrophotometer, oxygraph or membrane
potential measurement apparatus softwares were stored and
converted to ascii format. the data pairs format was used to
transfer the data to numerical analysis and graphics software.
therefore, the data obtained were utilized for averaging the
various curves that are the mean of 5 ± 6 experiments.

statistical analysis
all the values are the means+s.d. of not less than ®ve
measurements.

 xxxd248xxx  and mitochondrial permeability transition

1163

results
as apparent in figure 1, aurano®n, in the presence of
succinate, acts as a potent inducer of mitochondrial
membrane permeability transition both in the presence and
absence of calcium. by comparing figure 1a,b, it can be
observed that the presence of added calcium to the
incubation mixture, although at a relatively low concentration (12 mm), markedly reinforces the action of aurano®n.
the extent of swelling is concentration-dependent and occurs,
in our conditions, at concentrations as low as 16 nm, while,
at concentrations around 1 mm, the maximal rate and extent
of swelling are reached. energization by a respiratory
substance such as succinate appears critical for the occurrence of swelling since, in its absence, the swelling induced by
1.2 mm aurano®n, a concentration more than ten times higher
than that observed to give the maximal swelling (figure 1a,
trace e) is inhibited by about 70% (figure 1c, trace f ').
similarly, de-energization of mitochondria by the uncoupler
cccp (carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone) completely
prevents swelling (figure 1c, trace c'). the lack of eect
observed in the absence of succinate or in the presence of the

figure 1 induction of mitochondrial swelling by aurano®n. rat
liver mitochondria (0.25 mg ml71) were incubated at 258c in 213 mm
mannitol, 71 mm sucrose, 5 mm hepes-tris (ph 7.4), 5 mm
succinate, 3 mg ml71 rotenone, and 3 mm oligomycin. in (a) 12 mm
cacl2 was also present. in (a) and (b) swelling was triggered by the
addition of aurano®n at the following concentrations (nm): a, none;
b, 16; c, 33; d, 66; e, 100. in (c) swelling was initiated by 1.2 mm
aurano®n (g'). other additions were: a', 0.5 mm egta; b', no
aurano®n; c', 0.3 mm cccp; d', 0.5 mm  xxxd1781xxx ; e', 0.6 mm
ruthenium red; f', succinate absent.

m.p. rigobello et al

uncoupler is probably related to the prevention of calcium
uptake by the mitochondria. this interpretation is reinforced
by taking into account the eects of ruthenium red which is
an inhibitor of the electrophoretic uniport process of calcium
uptake (moore, 1971), and hence of calcium cycling, and
prevents the swelling induced by 1.2 mm aurano®n by more
than 70% (figure 1c, trace e'). as expected, egta
completely inhibits the swelling induced by aurano®n,
indicating the essentiality of calcium ions for the induction
of this change of mitochondrial membrane permeability
properties. swelling is also completely inhibited by  xxxd1781xxx  (figure 1c, trace d'), a drug considered to be a highly
speci®c inhibitor of the `pore' involved in the mitochondrial
permeability transition (fournier et al., 1987) indicating that
a speci®c increase of membrane permeability does occur after
the addition of aurano®n.
the eect of aurano®n on the mitochondrial membrane
potential is apparent in figure 2. rat liver mitochondria, in
the presence of succinate as a respiratory substrate, establish
a membrane potential of about 7180 mv. the addition of a
pulse of calcium ions (10 mm) determines a transient decrease,
rapidly re-established, of membrane potential due to calcium
intake. in standard conditions, this potential is maintained
for several minutes. when aurano®n is added there is a
progressive decrease of membrane potential followed by a
rapid and total collapse. the duration of the slow phase of
membrane potential decrease is inversely correlated with the
concentration of aurano®n added. in the presence of 10 mm
aurano®n (figure 2, trace f) the slow phase is no longer
apparent. the addition of egta after swelling partially
restores the membrane potential (not shown). the addition of
dtt (dithiothreitol), after the onset of swelling, stops the
latter without reversing the phenomenon, indicating an
involvement of thiol or selenol groups in the action of
aurano®n (not shown).
figure 3 reports the eects of aurano®n on mitochondrial
respiration in the presence and absence of egta. in the
latter case (figure 3b) the addition of 2 mm aurano®n
determines an increase of succinate-dependent respiration

 xxxd248xxx  and mitochondrial permeability transition

that is not further stimulated by the subsequent addition of
adp. this increase of respiration is dependent on the
swelling of mitochondria since it does not occur with the
nad-dependent substrates (not shown) and indicates that no
inhibition of respiration is elicited, at least at this concentration, by aurano®n. furthermore, in the presence of egta,
the `uncoupling' eect of aurano®n is no longer occurring
indicating that the mitochondrial energy conservation
mechanism is not aected.
as reported before, aurano®n is a potent and speci®c
inhibitor of  xxxg1826xxx  (gromer et al., 1998a). as
apparent in figure 4a, when a preparation of mitochondrial
matrix, able to reduce dtnb (5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic)
acid) in the presence of nadph, was treated with aurano®n,
the reduction of dtnb was completely inhibited. further
addition of  xxxd2811xxx  restores the reduction of
dtnb. this partial sensibility to the inhibition by aurano®n
indicates the presence of two dierent reactions, the ®rst
dependent on thioredoxin/ xxxg1826xxx  and sensitive
to aurano®n, while the second depends on the glutathione/
 xxxg981xxx  system and is not inhibited by
aurano®n. figure 4b shows that the isolated and puri®ed
mitochondrial  xxxg1826xxx  is completely inhibited
by very low concentrations of aurano®n (20 nm) in agreement
with the eect observed in the crude matrix, therefore
con®rming the sensitivity of the mitochondrial isoform of
the enzyme to this gold complex. a recent paper has shown
that the mitochondrial  xxxg1826xxx  is inhibited by
 xxxd2834xxx  (kerimova et al., 2000). in both cases, this is
a rather expected result because of the similarity at the active
site, between the mitochondrial and cytosolic isoforms of the
enzyme. it was further tested if, in condition of complete
prevention of swelling, the mitochondrial enzyme can be
inhibited by the same concentrations of aurano®n previously
used to induce the membrane permeability transition. when
mitochondria are incubated in the presence of  xxxd1781xxx 
and egta, in order to absolutely avoid swelling, and are
treated with increasing concentrations of aurano®n, a net
inhibition of  xxxg1826xxx  is apparent (figure 5a).
this result indicates that aurano®n is able to easily penetrate
the mitochondrial membrane and that the mitochondrial
isoform of this enzyme can be inhibited in its matrix
environment. in addition, the concentrations of aurano®n
able to completely inhibit the enzyme, correspond to those
inducing, in the absence of egta and  xxxd1781xxx , the
maximal swelling, thus indicating a direct link between the
two events. interestingly, in the same experimental conditions,  xxxg981xxx  is not modi®ed at all (figure 5b).
 xxxd248xxx  chloride (tepau) shows a behaviour
superimposable to that of aurano®n, while dimethylsulphide
gold chloride (dmsau) is less ecient (figure 5a).

alterations of mitochondria by gold-based compounds,
essentially used as anti-arthritic drugs, have been known for
a long time (stuve & galle, 1970; abou-khalil et al., 1981).
it was previously reported that gold complexes of bidentate
phosphine determine an alteration of mitochondrial functions
possibly acting as uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation
(hoke et al., 1988). their action appears to facilitate the

containing 1 mm edta. where indicated, 0.5 mm aurano®n and
1 mm  xxxd2811xxx  were also added. (b) aliquots of puri®ed mitochondrial

exchange of h+ and k+ and result of a gross increase of
membrane permeability (hoke et al., 1988). although with a
dierent mechanism, in isolated mitochondria,  xxxd248xxx  chloride causes a rapid dissipation of membrane
potential, inhibits state three respiration and decreases
respiratory control ratio (rush et al., 1987b; hoke et al.,
1989). it causes a concentration-dependent inhibition of
uncoupler-stimulated respiration that, however, can be
reversed by 2 mm dithiothreitol (rush et al., 1987b; hoke
et al., 1989) indicating that its inhibitory action is exerted
through a reversible binding to sulphhydryl groups. electron
microscopy of hepatocytes exposed to  xxxd248xxx 

chloride reveals that mitochondria are the ®rst organelles to
show an altered ultrastructure. after 60 min of incubation,
they undergo swelling with disruption of the cristae (rush et
al., 1987a). at variance with the previously reported gold
derivatives, less attention was paid to the interaction of
aurano®n with mitochondria. according to dong et al.
(1997), in some human tumour cell lines, cisplatin resistance
is associated with sensitivity to the killing by a large number
of inhibitors of mitochondrial functions including aurano®n.
the latter is eective at very low concentrations and its
action is potentially attributable to the inhibition of complex
iii or to an alteration of the membranes.
in the present paper, we report that aurano®n acts as a
potent inducer of mitochondrial permeability transition since
it is eective at very low concentrations. permeability
transition indicates an increase of the mitochondrial inner
membrane permeability possibly dependent on the opening of
an unselective pore, that can be elicited by calcium
accumulation and several inducing agents apparently unrelated from the chemical or functional point of view (gunter
& pfeier, 1990; zoratti & szaboá, 1995). the occurrence of
an eective permeability transition is demonstrated by the
marked inhibition exerted by  xxxd1781xxx , the speci®c
inhibitor of this process. egta is a strong inhibitor of the
aurano®n-induced permeability transition while, on the
contrary, the presence of calcium ions in the incubation
medium reinforces the action of aurano®n, indicating that
calcium acts as the critical factor in the induction of
permeability transition as pointed out by gunter & pfeier
(1990). the presence of a respiratory substrate appears
relevant for eliciting the eect of aurano®n that is no longer
apparent in its absence. in addition, the calcium transport
inhibitor ruthenium red and uncouplers inhibit the aurano®ninduced swelling eect. altogether, these observations
indicate that calcium ions play a fundamental role in eliciting
the aurano®n-dependent swelling. aurano®n, at the concentrations used in this study, is completely ineective in
inhibiting the ¯ux of electrons along the respiratory chain
(figure 3) at variance with  xxxd248xxx  chloride
(rush et al., 1987b; hoke et al., 1989). however, at
concentrations higher than 10 mm, aurano®n is also able to
inhibit the respiratory chain. although with dierent
reactivity, the action of both compounds should be essentially

followed by a rapid centrifugation of mitochondria at 65006g for

the same medium. the ®nal pellet was resuspended in 60 ml of 0.3 m
chaps (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulphonate), and 300 ml of 0.2 m tris-hcl (ph 8.1) containing 1 mm

referred to their interaction with thiol groups. interestingly,
aurano®n completely inhibits  xxxg1826xxx  at
concentrations scarcely aecting thiols (not shown) indicating
a speci®city of this compound towards the selenol moiety.
the redox state of soluble and membrane-bound mitochondrial thiol groups appears critical for controlling the permeability conditions of the membrane since, in general, swelling is
stimulated by thiol blocking or oxidizing agents and is
prevented by thiol reducing agents (siliprandi et al., 1978;
kowaltowski et al., 2001). however, in the presence of

 xxxd248xxx  and mitochondrial permeability transition

concentrations of aurano®n able to induce permeability
transition, the redox state of mitochondrial glutathione is not
modi®ed while total thiol groups are only slightly decreased
(not shown). this is at variance with the eect exhibited by
 xxxd248xxx  chloride that determines a marked
oxidation of glutathione both in hepatocytes (rush et al.,
1987a) and in isolated mitochondria (rush et al., 1987b; hoke
et al., 1989). up to now, the thiols involved in permeability
transition are not clearly de®ned. we show that mitochondrial
 xxxg1826xxx  is invariably inhibited also at very low
concentrations of aurano®n indicating a potential correlation
between its inhibition and permeability transition. it appears
that the inhibition of mitochondrial  xxxg1826xxx ,
associated with a proper amount of endogenous calcium, can
create the conditions for the increase of membrane permeability since calcium ions are essential triggers of this condition
(gunter & pfeier, 1990). we have previously reported that an
inhibitor of  xxxg1826xxx  such as  xxxd2404xxx  is
also an inducer of permeability transition and apoptosis
(rigobello et al., 1999). similar considerations can be drawn
for arsenicals,  xxxd2563xxx  and alloxan (gunter & pfeier, 1990;
zoratti & szaboá, 1995; sakurai et al., 2001; arneár et al., 1999).
more recently it was reported that ebselen, an antioxidant
selenazol drug and glutathione peroxidase mimic (sies, 1993),
is able to induce swelling and calcium release (gogvadze et al.,
2000) acting also as a direct substrate for  xxxg1826xxx 
(holmgren et al., 2000).
as previously reported (chaudieáre & tappel, 1984; berry
et al., 1991; hill et al., 1997; gromer et al., 1998a, b; smith
et al., 1999), gold(i) compounds show a speci®c reactivity
with selenoenzymes such as glutathione peroxidase, iodothyronine deiodinase type i and  xxxg1826xxx .
the latter enzyme appears extremely sensitive to this
inhibition (gromer et al., 1998a). therefore, aurano®n, at
the mitochondrial level, allows to establish a link between a
speci®c enzyme inhibition and a function such as permeability transition. as pointed out by nordberg & arneár
(2001) the inhibition of  xxxg1826xxx  activity leads
to an impaired regeneration of the large number of the
substrates of this enzyme and a decrease of the total
antioxidant capacity. in particular, the regeneration of
reduced thioredoxin is drastically hampered. all this brings
to a shift towards a more oxidized state of thiols and to an
increased production of reactive oxygen species (nordberg &
arneár, 2001). this is particularly important at the
mitochondrial level since this organelle plays also a crucial
role in controlling cellular apoptosis. a recent paper on the
eects of aurano®n on neutrophil apoptosis (liu et al.,
2000) reports contrasting eects since low concentrations of
aurano®n delay spontaneous apoptosis, while higher concentrations shorten cell survival. in preliminary experiments
(not reported) we have observed that aurano®n is able to
induce, in isolated mitochondria, at all the concentrations
tested, the release of  xxxg569xxx , indicating a potential
enhancement of cell apoptosis.
