the pharmacological characteristics of w3 hxdofetilide binding were examined in membranes prepared from human embryonic kidney

w3 hxdofetilide binding. in addition, the structurally unrelated compounds  xxxd2956xxx , terfenadine and haloperidol, all of which prolong the
qt interval in man, also inhibited binding. these data indicate that a w3 hxdofetilide binding assay using herg membranes may help
identify compounds that prolong the qt interval. q 2001 published by elsevier science b.v.

long qt syndrome is a potentially lethal cardiac condition associated with mutations in genes that encode for ion
channel proteins. of these, the best recognised is the kq
channel i kr , encoded by the human ether-a-go-go
related
´
gene žherg; de ponti et al., 2000.. an interaction with
herg has been implicated in the cardiotoxic effects of
second-generation anti-histamines and other drugs that have
been withdrawn from the market in recent years. at present, screening for long qt potential in industry is being
evaluated using animals želectrocardiogram., cardiac tissue
žmicroelectrode., isolated myocytes and herg transfected
cells žpatch clamp.. however, these approaches are timeconsuming and expensive and the need for a simple high
throughput assay has been highlighted žnetzer et al., 2001..
in this study, we show that w3 hxdofetilide binding to
herg transfected membranes is inhibited by antiarrhythmics and structurally unrelated compounds known to prolong the qt interval in man.

human embryonic kidney žhek293. cells stably expressing herg žzhou et al., 1998. were maintained in
culture and membranes prepared as described previously
žfinlayson et al., 2001a.. w3 hxdofetilide binding to herg
transfected membranes was performed in a sodium buffer
without bovine  xxxg124xxx , as for whole cell studies
žfinlayson et al., 2001b.. assay buffer or test drug ž30 ml.
was incubated with 20 ml of w3 hxdofetilide žfinal concentration 10 nm. and 150 ml of membranes at 378c for 60
min. binding was terminated by filtration onto glass filters
žgfrc in 0.25% polyethylenimine., followed by three
rapid washes ž2 ml. with tris–hcl buffer, radioactivity
was determined by scintillation counting and data were
analysed as described before žfinlayson et al., 2001b..
w3 hxdofetilide binds to an unidentified endogenous protein in whole hek293 cells, but not to membranes prepared from these cells. by examining w3 hxdofetilide binding to membranes from herg transfected hek293 cells,
we avoided any contribution from the endogenous binding
site žfinlayson et al., 2001b.. the affinity ž k d  xxxd2913xxx .6 "
13.5 nm; n s 5. and hill slope ž n h s 0.82 " 0.04. of
w3 hxdofetilide were similar to that described previously
žfinlayson et al., 2001b.. however, the rank order of
potency for antiarrhythmic compounds was different from

fig. 1. inhibition of w3 hxdofetilide binding in herg transfected membranes. membranes were spun, resuspended in assay buffer and w3 hx
dofetilide binding was performed as described. data shown are representative competition curves from single experiments; k d r k i values were

0.15, n s 4. and d-sotalol ž k i s 134 " 22.5 mm, n h s
0.72 " 0.06, n s 5. žfig. 1.. the high affinity of clofilium
in this assay suggests that it may be a useful ligand for
herg. furthermore, ly97241 a tertiary analogue of
clofilium, with 10-fold higher affinity for herg, may be
better still žsuessbrich et al., 1997.. interestingly, way123,398, which did not inhibit w3 hxdofetilide binding to
whole hek293 cells žfinlayson et al., 2001b., reduced
w3 hxdofetilide binding to herg membranes, although not
completely žfig. 1.. in addition, w3 hxdofetilide binding to
herg membranes was also reduced in a concentration
dependent manner by the antipsychotics  xxxd2956xxx  ž k i s
70.6 " 11.8 nm, n h s 0.89 " 0.12, n s 4. and haloperidol
ž k i s 549 " 83.6 nm, n h s 0.75 " 0.07, n s 4., and by
the antihistamine terfenadine ž k i s 381 " 60.0 nm, n h s
0.76 " 0.14, n s 4., all of which cause qt prolongation
žkang et al., 2000; vandenberg et al., 2001.. the affinities
of  xxxd2956xxx , terfenadine and haloperidol are consistent
with those in electrophysiological studies žsuessbrich et

al., 1997; kang et al., 2000.. intriguingly, high concentrations of histamine also inhibited binding ž k i s 1.58 " 0.13
mm, n h s 1.16 " 0.19, n s 4, fig. 1..
it has been questioned whether a nonfunctional assay
such as w3 hxdofetilide binding could be used as a preclinical screen for herg channel blockers, as compounds
chemically unrelated to dofetilide may act at different sites
on the channel žnetzer et al., 2001.. however, we have
shown that unrelated molecules known to cause long qt
prolongation such as  xxxd2956xxx , terfenadine and haloperidol
also inhibit w3 hxdofetilide binding, perhaps due to the
unique properties and pore size of this channel žvandenberg et al., 2001.. therefore, this assay could provide a
useful preclinical screen to detect compounds that may
prolong the qt interval in man.
