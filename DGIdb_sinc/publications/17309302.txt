this review is an updated and expanded version of two prior reviews that were published in this journal in 1997 and
2003. in the case of all approved agents the time frame has been extended to include the 251/2 years from 01/1981 to
06/2006 for all diseases worldwide and from 1950 (earliest so far identified) to 06/2006 for all approved antitumor
drugs worldwide. we have continued to utilize our secondary subdivision of a “natural product mimic” or “nm” to join
the original primary divisions. from the data presented, the utility of natural products as sources of novel structures, but
not necessarily the final drug entity, is still alive and well. thus, in the area of cancer, over the time frame from around
the 1940s to date, of the 155 small molecules, 73% are other than “s” (synthetic), with 47% actually being either
natural products or directly derived therefrom. in other areas, the influence of natural product structures is quite marked,
with, as expected from prior information, the antiinfective area being dependent on natural products and their structures.
although combinatorial chemistry techniques have succeeded as methods of optimizing structures and have, in fact,
been used in the optimization of many recently approved agents, we are able to identify only one de novo combinatorial
compound approved as a drug in this 25 plus year time frame. we wish to draw the attention of readers to the rapidly
evolving recognition that a significant number of natural product drugs/leads are actually produced by microbes and/or
microbial interactions with the “host from whence it was isolated”, and therefore we consider that this area of natural
product research should be expanded significantly.
it is over nine years since the publication of our first,1 and three
years since the second,2 analysis of the sources of new and approved
drugs for the treatment of human diseases, both of which indicated
that natural products continued to play a highly significant role in
the drug discovery and development process.
that this influence of nature in one guise or another has
continued is shown by inspection of the information given below,
where with the advantage of now over 25 years of data, we have
been able to refine the system, eliminating a few duplicative entries
that crept into the original data sets. in particular, as behooves
authors from the national cancer institute (nci), in the specific
case of cancer treatments, we have gone back to consult the records
of the fda and added to these, comments from investigators who
have informed us over the past two years of compounds that may
have been approved in other countries and that were not captured
in our earlier searches. these cancer data will be presented as a
stand-alone section as well as including the last 25 years of data in
the overall discussion.
as we mentioned in our 2003 review,2 the development of highthroughput screens based on molecular targets had led to a demand
for the generation of large libraries of compounds to satisfy the
enormous capacities of these screens. as we mentioned at that time,
the shift away from large combinatorial libraries has continued,
with the emphasis now being on small, focused (100 to ∼3000)
collections that contain much of the “structural aspects” of natural
products. various names have been given to this process, including
“diversity oriented syntheses”,3-6 but we prefer to simply say
“more natural product-like”, in terms of their combinations of
heteroatoms and significant numbers of chiral centers within a single
molecule,7 or even “natural product mimics” if they happen to be
direct competitive inhibitors of the natural substrate. it should also
be pointed out that lipinski’s fifth rule effectively states that the
first four rules do not apply to natural products or to any molecule
⊥ dedicated to the late dr. kenneth l. rinehart of the university of
illinois at urbana-champaign for his pioneering work on bioactive natural
products.

that is recognized by an active transport system when considering
“druggable chemical entities”.8-10
although combinatorial chemistry in one or more of its
manifestations has now been used as a discovery source for
approximately 70% of the time covered by this review, to date, we
can find only one de novo new chemical entity (nce) reported in
the public domain as resulting from this method of chemical
discovery and approved for drug use anywhere. this is the antitumor
compound known as sorafenib (nexavar, 1) from bayer, approved
by the fda in 2005. it was known during development as bay43-9006 and is a multikinase inhibitor, targeting several serine/
threonine and receptor tyrosine kinases ( xxxg1924xxx ,  xxxg1274xxx ,
 xxxg802xxx ,  xxxg1710xxx , kit, and  xxxg801xxx ) and is in multiple clinical
trials as both combination and single-agent therapies at the present
time, a common practice once approved for one class of cancer
treatment.
as mentioned by the authors in prior reviews on this topic and
others, the developmental capability of combinatorial chemistry as
a means for structural optimization once an active skeleton has been
identified is without par. the expected surge in productivity,
however, has not materialized; thus, the number of new active
substances (nass), also known as new chemical entities (nces),
which we consider to encompass all molecules, including biologics
and vaccines, from our data set hit a 24-year low of 25 in 2004
(though 28% of these were assigned to the nd category), with a
rebound to 54 in 2005, with 24% being n or nd and 37% being
biologics (b) or vaccines (v). fortunately, however, research being
conducted by groups such as danishefsky’s, ganesan’s, nicolaou’s,
porco’s, quinn’s, schreiber’s, shair’s, waldmann’s, and wipf’s is
continuing the modification of active natural product skeletons as
leads to novel agents, so in due course, the numbers of materials
developed by linking mother nature to combinatorial synthetic
techniques should increase. this aspect, plus the potential contributions from the utilization of genetic analyses of microbes, will be
discussed at the end of this review.
against this backdrop, we now present an updated analysis of
the role of natural products in the drug discovery and development
process, dating from 01/1981 through 06/2006. as in our earlier

analyses,1,2 we have consulted the annual reports of medicinal
chemistry, in this case from 1984 to 2005,11-32 and have produced
a more comprehensive coverage of the 1981-2006 time frame
through addition of data from the publication drug news and
perspective33-49 and searches of the prous integrity database, as
well as by including information from individual investigators. we
also updated the biologicals section of the data set using information
culled from disparate sources that culminated in a recent review
(2005) on biopharmaceutical drugs.50
we have also included relevant references in a condensed form
in tables 1-5, 8, and 9; otherwise the numbers of references cited
in the review would become overwhelming. in these cases, “armc
##” refers to the volume of annual reports in medicinal chemistry
together with the page on which the structure(s) can be found.
similarly, “dnp ##” refers to the volume of drug news and
perspective and the corresponding page(s), and an “i ######” is
the accession number in the prous integrity database. finally, we
have used “boyd” to refer to a review article51 on clinical antitumor
agents and “m’dale” to refer to martindale52 with the relevant page
noted.
it should be noted that the “year” header in all tables is the
“year of introduction” of the drug. in some cases there are
discrepancies between sources as to the actual year due to
differences in definitions. we have generally taken the earliest year
in the absence of further information.

tion whether obtained by direct experiment or by in silico studies
followed by direct assay in the relevant system. similarly, a number
of new peptidic drug entities, though formally synthetic in
nature, are simply produced by synthetic methods rather than
by the use of fermentation or extraction. in some cases, an end
group might have been changed for ease of recovery. in addition,
a number of compounds produced totally by synthesis are, in fact,
isosteres of the peptidic substrate and are thus “natural product
mimics” in the truest sense of the term. for further information on
this area, interested readers should consult the excellent review by
hruby.53

results
as before, we have covered only new chemical entities (nces)
in the present analysis. if one reads the fda and phrma web
sites, the numbers of nda approvals are in the high tens to low
hundred numbers for the last few years. if, however, one removes
combinations of older drugs and old drugs with new indications,
and/or improved delivery systems, then the number of true nces
is only in the 20s to just over 50 per year for the last five or so
years (see figures 2 and 5).
as in our earlier analyses,1,2 the data have been analyzed in terms
of numbers and classified according to their origin using both the
previous major categories and their subdivisions.
major categories of sources. the major categories used are
as follows:
“b” biological; usually a large (>45 residues) peptide or protein
either isolated from an organism/cell line or produced by biotechnological means in a surrogate host.
“n” natural product.
“nd” derived from a natural product and is usually a semisynthetic modification.
“s” totally synthetic drug, often found by random screening/
modification of an existing agent.
“s*” made by total synthesis, but the pharmacophore is/was from
a natural product.
“v” vaccine.
subcategory. “nm” natural product mimic (see rationale and
examples below).
(for amplification as to the rationales used for categorizing using
the above subdivisions, the reader should consult the earlier
reviews.1,2)
in the field of anticancer therapy, the advent in 2001 of gleevec,
a protein  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor, was justly heralded as a
breakthrough in the treatment of leukemia. this compound was
classified as an “nm” on the basis of its competitive displacement
of the natural substrate atp, whose intracellular concentrations can
approach 5 mm. we have continued to classify ptk and other
kinase inhibitors that are approved as drugs under the “/nm”
category for exactly the same reasons as elaborated in the 2003
review2 and have continued to extend it to cover other direct
inhibitors/antagonists of the natural substrate/receptor interac-

as an example of what can be found by studies around relatively
simple peptidomimics of the  xxxg99xxx  structure, the recent
paper of wan et al.54 demonstrating the modification of the known
but nonselective at1/ xxxg101xxx  agonist l-162313 (2, itself related to the
sartans) into the highly selective  xxxg101xxx  agonist (3) (a peptidomimetic
structure) led to the very recent identification of short pseudopeptides exemplified by 4, which is equipotent (binding affinity )
500 pm) with  xxxg99xxx  and has a better than 20 000-fold
selectivity versus at1, whereas  xxxg99xxx  has only a 5-fold
binding selectivity in the same assay.55 it will be interesting to see
if any compounds such as these will end up as cardiovascular
agents since it has been demonstrated that activation of the  xxxg101xxx 
receptor affects cardiac remodeling and leads to reduced blood
pressure.56
in the area of modifications of natural products by combinatorial
methods to produce entirely different compounds that may bear
little if any resemblance to the original, but are legitimately
assignable to the “nm” category, citations are given in previous
reviews.3,57-64 in addition, one should consult the recent reports
from waldmann’s group65,66 and those by ganesan,67 shang and
tan,68 constantino,69 and violette et al.70 on the use of privileged
structures as skeletons around which to build libraries. another
paper of interest in this regard is the editorial by macarron from
gsk,9 as this may be the first time where data from industry on
the results of hts screens of combichem libraries versus potential
targets were reported with a discussion of lead discovery rates. in
this paper, macarron reemphasizes the fifth lipinski rule, which is
often ignored; “natural products do not obey the other four”.

the extensive data sets shown in the figures and tables referred
to above highlight the continuing role that natural products and
structures derived from or related to natural products from all
sources have played and continue to play in the development of
the current therapeutic armamentarium of the physician. inspection
of the data shows this continued important role for natural products

in spite of the current low level of natural products-based drug
discovery programs in major pharmaceutical houses.
inspection of the rate of nce approvals as shown in figure 2
demonstrates that the natural products field is still producing or is
involved in ∼50% of all small molecules in the years 2000-2006
and that a significant number of nces are biologicals or vaccines
(83 of 264, or 31.4%). this is so in spite of many years of work
by the pharmaceutical industry devoted to high-throughput screening
of predominately combinatorial chemistry products and that the time
period chosen should have provided a sufficient time span for
combinatorial chemistry work from the late 1980s onward to have
produced approved nces.
overall, of the 1184 nces covering all diseases/countries/sources
in the years 01/1981-06/2006, and using the “nm” classifications
introduced in our 2003 review,1,2 30% were synthetic in origin,
thus demonstrating the influence of “other than formal synthetics”
on drug discovery and approval (figure 1).
inspection of table 1 demonstrates that, overall, the major disease
areas that have been investigated (in terms of numbers of drugs
approved) in the pharmaceutical industry continue to be infectious
diseases (microbial, parasitic, and viral), cancer, antihypertensives,
and antiinflammatory indications, all with over 50 approved drug
therapies. it should be noted, however, that numbers of approved
drugs/disease do not correlate with the “value” as measured by sales,
since the best selling drug of all is atorvastin, a hypocholesterolemic
descended directly from a natural product, which sold over $11
billion in 2004 and is at or above this level even today.
the major category by far is that of antiinfectives including
antiviral vaccines, with 230 (22.8%) of the total (1010 for
indications g 4) falling into this one major human disease area.
on further analyses (tables 6 and 7), the influence of biologicals
and vaccines in this disease complex is such that only a little over
30% are synthetic in origin. if one considers only small molecules
(reducing the total by 50 to 180; table 10), then the synthetic figure
goes up to 31.1%, marginally greater than in our previous report.2
as reported previously,1,2 these synthetic drugs actually tend to be
of two basic chemotypes, the azole-based antifungals and the
quinolone-based antibacterials.
four small molecule drugs were approved in the antibacterial
area from 01/2003 to 06/2006. these included daptomycin (n, 5)
from cubist, a lipopeptide whose biosynthetic cluster has been
successfully cloned and expressed by investigators associated with
cubist.71 wyeth had their modified tetracycline derivative, tigecycline, approved (nd, 6), a drug designed to overcome the tet
resistance pump in pathogenic bacteria, and another carbapenem
(nd) and a quinolone (s) were also approved in this time frame.
in the antifungal area, of the five drugs approved, four were azoles
(s) and the echinocandin derivative, anidulofungin (nd), was
approved for use in the u.s. in early 2006. in the antiviral area,
seven drugs were approved for hiv treatment (1 nd, 1 s*, 5 s*/
nm). it is interesting that the one nd, enfuvirtide, though listed in
most literature as a synthetic, is actually the “end-capped” 36-

residue peptide that corresponds to residues 643-678 of the hiv-1
transmembrane protein gp41 and blocks viral fusion with the cell.72
in addition to this novel mechanism, four new hiv protease
inhibitors were approved; all were peptidomimetics imitating the
peptide substrate, and the latest one, darunavir (7), actually has
the hydroxyethyl isostere that was first identified in the microbial
aspartic protease inhibitor pepstatin and incorporated in the base
structure of crixivan (see discussion by yang et al.73).

it should be noted that the percentages used in the following
overall analyses do not always agree with those in the later tables,
as all sources, which include b and v categorized drugs, and all
indications are included in the percentage figures used in the
analyses. much fuller details are given in the supporting information
in the form of an excel xp spreadsheet.
as we reported in our earlier analyses,1,2 there are still significant
therapeutic classes where the available drugs are totally synthetic
at the present time. these include antihistamines, diuretics, and
hypnotics for indications with four or more approved drugs (cf.
table 1). there are a substantial number of indications where there
are three or less drugs that are also totally synthetic. because of
our introduction of the “nm” subcategory, indications such as
antidepressants and cardiotonics now have substantial numbers that,
although formally “s”, now fall into the “s/nm” subcategory.
from inspection of tables 1-4 and 8 and the excel xp
spreadsheet, the following points can be made in addition to the
digest on antiinfectives given in tables 6 and 7. in the antibacterial
area (table 2), as found previously, the vast majority of the 98
small molecule nces are n (10; 10.2%), nd (64; 65.3%), or s*/
nm (1; 1%), amounting to 75 in total, or 76.5% of the whole, with
the remainder (s) being predominately quinolones. in the antifungal
area (table 3), the roles of the small molecules (n ) 28) are
reversed, with the great majority being s (22; 78.6%) and s/nm
(3; 10.7%), with the remainder being nd (3; 10.7%).
in the antiviral area (table 4), the situation is somewhat different,
with a large number of vaccines (n ) 25) now added to this

category. if we consider only small molecules, the anti-hiv drugs
being approved are based mainly on nucleoside structures (s*) or
on peptidomimetics (s* and s/nm), and drugs against other viral
diseases also fall into these categories. thus, one can see that of
the 42 small molecule approved antiviral agents, the relevant figures
are nd (2; 4.8%), s* and s*/nm categories (32; 76.2%), with the
remainder falling into either s (7; 16.7%) or s/nm (1; 2.4%).
we have also identified the antiparasitic drugs that have been
approved over the years (table 5) and point out that of the 14 small
molecule drugs, only four are synthetic (28.5%) and of the rest,
three are artemisinin derivatives. what is of interest with this base
structure is that, in addition to their known antimalarial activities,
compounds based on this structure are demonstrating activity as
antitumor agents.74
with anticancer drugs (table 8), where in the time frame covered
(01/1981-06/2006) there were 100 nces in toto, the number of
nonbiologicals was 81 (81%). these small molecules could be
divided as follows (using 81 ) 100%) into n (9; 11.1%), nd (25;
30.9%), s (18; 22.2%), s/nm (12; 14.8%), s* (11; 13.6%), and
s*/nm (6; 7.4%). thus, using our criteria, only 22.2% of the total
number of anticancer drugs were classifiable into the s (synthetic)
category. expressed as a proportion of the nonbiologicals/vaccines,
then 63 of 81 (77.8%) were either natural products per se or were
based thereon, or mimicked natural products in one form or another.
in this current review, we have continued as in our previous
contribution (2003)2 to reassess the influence of natural products
and their mimics as leads to anticancer drugs. by using data from
the fda listings of antitumor drugs, coupled with our previous
data sources and with help from japanese colleagues, we have been
able to identify the years in which all but 18 of the 175 drugs we
have listed in table 9 were approved. we have identified these
other 18 agents by inspection of three time-relevant textbooks on
antitumor treatment,51,75,76 and these were added to the overall
listings using the lead authors’ names as the source citation.
inspection of figures 5-7 and table 9 shows that, over the whole
category of anticancer drugs effectively available to the west and
japan, the 175 available agents can be categorized as follows: b
(18; 10%), n (25; 14%), nd (48; 28%), s (42; 24%), s/nm (14;
8%), s* (20; 11%), s*/nm (6; 4%), and v (2; 1%). if one removes
the biologicals and vaccines, reducing the overall number to 155
(100%), the number of naturally inspired agents (i.e., n, nd, s/nm,
s*, s*/nm) is 113 (72.9%). it should be noted that these 155 agents
do not include some of the earlier drugs that were really immuno-

one extra drug added, approved june 28, 2006, launched july 3, 2006.

or hematologic stimulants. etoposide phosphate is not included in
this count, as it is a prodrug of etoposide, though it was included
in our last review as an approved nce. we have however included
paclitaxel nanoparticles, as this is not just a salt form but is a novel
form of the agent ensuring much better water solubility.
in our earlier papers, the number of nonsynthetic antitumor agents
was 62% for other than biologicals/vaccines, without an “nm”
subcategory. the corresponding figure obtained by removing the
nm subcategory in this analysis is 64%. thus, the proportion has
remained similar in spite of some reassignments of sources and
the expansion of combinatorial chemistry techniques. as mentioned
earlier, the first and only de novo combinatorial drug that we have
been able to identify was approved by the fda in 2005 under the
generic name of sorafenib mesylate (1) for the treatment of
advanced renal cancer.
a major general class of drugs that was not commented on in
any detail in our earlier papers is the class that is directed toward
the treatment of diabetes, both types i and ii (table 10; n ) 32).
these drugs include a significant number of biologics based upon
varying modifications of insulin produced in general by biotechnological means (b, 18; 56.3%).50 in addition to these well-known
agents, the class also includes a very interesting compound
(approved by the fda in 2005) that is assigned to the nd class
(extenatide or byetta). this is the first in a new class of therapeutic

agents known as incretin mimetics. the drug exhibits glucoselowering activity similar to the naturally occurring incretin hormone
glucagon-like peptide-1 (glp-1), but is a 39-residue peptide based
upon one of the peptide venoms of the gila monster, heloderma
suspectum.77

discussion
as alluded to in our previous review, the decline or leveling of
the output of the r&d programs of the pharmaceutical companies
has continued, with the number of drugs of all types dropping in
2003 to 35 launches, including 13 in the b/v categories, and
reaching a nadir in 2004, when only 25 were launches and 6 of
these fell into the b/v categories. there was a significant upswing
in 2005 with 54 launches, but 20 of these were in the b/v
categories, leaving 34 small molecules. in the first 6 months of
2006, of the 22 launches, 9 were b/v.
although combinatorial chemistry continues to play a major role
in the drug development process, as mentioned earlier, it is
noteworthy that the trend toward the synthesis of complex natural
product-like libraries has continued. as was eloquently stated by
danishefsky in 2002, “a small collection of smart compounds may
be more valuable than a much larger hodgepodge collection
mindlessly assembled”.78 recently he and a coauthor restated this
theme:79

figure 3. all small molecule new chemical entities, 01/1981-06/2006, by source (n ) 974).
in summary, we have presented several happy experiences
in the course of our program directed toward bringing to bear
nature’s treasures of small molecule natural products on the
momentous challenge of human neurodegenerative diseases.
while biological results are now being accumulated for systematic disclosure, it is already clear that there is considerable
potential in compounds obtained through plowing in the
landscape of natural products. particularly impressive are those
compounds that are obtained through diverted total synthesis,
i.e., through methodology, which was redirected from the
original (and realized) goal of total synthesis, to encompass
otherwise unavailable congeners. we are confident that the
program will lead, minimally, to compounds that are deserving
of serious preclinical follow-up. at the broader level, we note

that this program will confirm once again (if further confirmation is, indeed, necessary) the extraordinary advantages of small
molecule natural products as sources of agents, which interject
themselves in a helpful way in various physiological processes.
we close with the hope and expectation that enterprising and
hearty organic chemists will not pass up the unique head start
that natural products provide in the quest for new agents and
new directions in medicinal discovery. we would chance to
predict that even as the currently fashionable “telephone
directory” mode of research is subjected to much overdue
scrutiny and performance-based assessment, organic chemists
in concert with biologists and even clinicians will be enjoying
as well as exploiting the rich troves provided by nature’s small
molecules.

a rapid analysis of the entities approved from 2003 to 2006 (the
full data set is available as an excel spreadsheet in the supporting
information) indicated that there were significant numbers of
antitumor, antibacterial, and antifungal agents approved as mentioned above. this time frame also saw two very important
approvals, both of which were natural products. the first was the
approval by the fda, after a long series of trials and discussions,
of the cone snail toxin known as prialt, which is the first “direct
from the sea” entity to become a licensed pharmaceutical.80,81
although one can argue (as we have on other occasions) that the
discovery of the arabinose nucleosides by bergmann in the 1950s
was the driving force behind ara-a,  xxxd1790xxx , azt, etc., this is the
first direct transition from marine invertebrate to man. also in the
middle of 2006, the botanical preparation hemoxin82,83 was

approved in nigeria following demonstration of efficacy in clinical
trials as a treatment for sickle cell anemia. this is a mix of plants
that came from native healer information and thus can be classified
as a “true ethnobotanical preparation”.
in this paper, as we stated in 2003,2 we have again demonstrated
that natural products play a dominant role in the discovery of leads
for the development of drugs for the treatment of human diseases.
some have argued (though not in press, only in personal conversations at various fora) that the introduction of categories such as
s/nm and s*/nm is an overstatement of the role played by natural
products in the drug discovery process. on the contrary, we would
argue that these further serve to illustrate the inspiration provided
by nature to receptive organic chemists in devising ingenious
syntheses of structural mimics to compete with mother nature’s

“treasure trove of small molecules” remains to be explored,
particularly from the marine and microbial environments.

figure 7. approved anticancer agents, organized by source/year
(unknown dates for 18).
from the perspective of microbes and their role(s) as sources of
novel bioactive entities, the recent work that has been reported by
a variety of investigators as to the potential of these organisms needs
to be widely disseminated. over the last few years, it has become
obvious from analyses of the published (and, to some extent,
unpublished) genomic sequences of a variety of microbes that there
are at least a dozen potential biosynthetic clusters in each organism
surveyed and, in certain well-publicized cases, over 30 such
groupings.84-92 in the marine environment the interplay of these
two sources, as exemplified by the recent review by newman and
hill,93 leaves no doubt that a host of novel, bioactive chemotypes
await discovery from both terrestrial and marine sources.
in this respect it should be noted that in the last year or so there
has been a very significant series of findings where the well-known
antitumor agents camptothecin94 and podophyllotoxin95 and vincristine96 have now been produced by fermentation of endophytic
fungi, isolated from the producing plants. the usual argument that
these are artifacts because of the inability to produce large quantities
by regular fermentation processes has been shown to be specious
by the work by bok et al.84 with aspergillus nidulans. this work
demonstrated that one has to be able to find the “genetic on switch”
to be able to obtain expression of such clusters outside of the host.
in addition to these papers the reader’s attention is also drawn to
the recent excellent review article by gunatilaka97 on this subject,
which gives an excellent overview of the numbers of materials so
far discovered from these sources. as a result, investigators need
to consider all possible routes to novel agents.
to us, a multidisciplinary approach to drug discovery, involving
the generation of truly novel molecular diversity from natural
product sources, combined with total and combinatorial synthetic
methodologies, and including the manipulation of biosynthetic
pathways (so-called combinatorial biosynthesis), provides the best
solution to the current productivity crisis facing the scientific
community engaged in drug discovery and development.
once more, as we stated in our 2003 review,2 we strongly
advocate expanding, not decreasing, the exploration of nature as a
source of novel active agents that may serve as the leads and
scaffolds for elaboration into desperately needed efficacious drugs
for a multitude of disease indications.
