a comparison of the effects of  xxxd2065xxx  and ibuprofen on renal
haemodynamics, tubular function, renin, vasopressin and urinary
excretion of albumin and a-glutathione-s -transferase
in healthy subjects: a placebo-controlled cross-over study
received: 10 november 1999 / accepted: 21 april 2000

abstract background: non-steroidal anti-in¯ammatory
drugs (nsaids) are known to be potentially nephrotoxic agents. nsaids inhibit the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase and thereby block the prostagladin synthesis in
the kidneys. cyclo-oxygenase exists in two isoforms
(cox-1 and cox-2). it has been proposed that nsaids with preferential cox-2 selectivity have fewer renal
side eects than drugs with preferential cox-1 selectivity.  xxxd2065xxx  is a relative selective inhibitor of cox-2,
while ibuprofen has a higher potency against cox-1
than cox-2.
objective: in this study, we compared the eects of  xxxd2065xxx  and ibuprofen on renal function, plasma renin,
plasma  xxxd3495xxx  and the urinary excretion of
albumin and a-glutathione-s-transferase (a-gst).
methods: in a randomised, double-blind, three-way
crossover study with placebo, we compared the eects of
2 weeks of treatment with ibuprofen and  xxxd2065xxx  on
renal haemodynamics [glomerular ®ltration rate (gfr),
renal plasma ¯ow (rpf) and ®ltration fraction (ff)],
tubular function and plasma concentrations of the hormones renin (prc) and  xxxd3495xxx  (avp) in
18 healthy subjects. in addition, we examined the eects
on the urinary excretion of albumin and a-gst as
markers of renal injury.
results: no dierences were found between the three
treatments, placebo, ibuprofen and  xxxd2065xxx , in the
eects on gfr, rpf, ff, free water clearance, urinary
output or fractional excretion of potassium and sodium.
however, ibuprofen, in contrast to  xxxd2065xxx , caused a
signi®cant decrease in both lithium clearance ()16%
versus placebo) and the fractional excretion of lithium

()17% versus placebo), suggesting an increase in the reabsorption in the proximal tubuli. prc was reduced
signi®cantly by ibuprofen ()32% versus placebo) but
not  xxxd2065xxx . none of the drugs changed avp. fourteen
days of treatment with ibuprofen caused a signi®cant
decrease ()47% versus placebo) in the urinary excretion
of a-gst, while no changes were seen after  xxxd2065xxx .
none of the drugs changed the urinary excretion of
albumin.
conclusion: in conclusion, a 14-day administration of
 xxxd2065xxx  or ibuprofen in therapeutic doses did not aect
the renal haemodynamics, the net excretion of electrolytes or the urinary excretion of albumin in healthy
subjects. however, ibuprofen, in contrast to  xxxd2065xxx ,
caused a reduction in prc, suggesting that cox-1 is
involved in basal renin release in humans. furthermore,
ibuprofen decreased lithium excretion suggesting that
cox-1 is involved in the re-absorption of sodium and/or
water in the proximal tubuli. the reduction in the urinary excretion of a-gst by ibuprofen may be caused by
an inhibition of the detoxi®cation enzyme by ibuprofen.
overall the study indicates that only small dierences in
the eects of the two drugs on renal function in healthy
subjects exist during a treatment period of 2 weeks.

introduction
non-steroidal anti-in¯ammatory drugs (nsaids),
commonly used in the treatment of rheumatic diseases
and other conditions associated with pain, are potentially nephrotoxic agents. nsaids block the synthesis of
the prostaglandins (pgs) by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase. in the normo-volaemic state, the synthesis of
renal pgs is low, but under certain conditions (e.g. decreased eective arterial blood volume, extra-cellular
volume depletion, chronic renal insucience) renal function is dependent on the locally synthesised vasodilator
pgs (pge2 and pgi2) to counteract the vasoconstrictor

eects of such drugs as norepinephrine,  xxxg99xxx 
and vasopressin. treatment with nsaids in these
situations may provoke acute renal failure [1±5]. fluid
and electrolyte disorders, chronic renal failure, tubulointestitial nephritis and papillary necrosis are other
abnormalities associated with nsaid treatment in
patients at risk [1].
the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase exists in two isoforms
(cox-1 and cox-2) [6±8]. cox-1 is constitutively
expressed in most tissues. cox-2 was nearly undetectable in the ®rst studies in normal rodent tissue (with the
exception of lung and liver), but the isozyme was
inducible by dierent stimuli, such as in¯ammatory
mediators, oncogenes and growth factors [9, 10]. however, later studies also found cox-2 constitutively expressed in the kidneys and the stomach [11±13]. the
roles of the two isozymes in the kidney are not well
known, but both are probably involved in normal
physiological renal responses [8]. nsaids are capable of
inhibiting both cox-1 and cox-2, but there are differences among nsaids with regard to their relative
inhibition of the two isoforms [14]. several studies suggest that preferentially cox-2-selective nsaids have
fewer side eects than compounds with a higher potency
against cox-1 (e.g. gastric irritation and renal adverse
eects) [15±18].
 xxxd2065xxx  and ibuprofen dier in their relative inhibition of cox-1 and cox-2.  xxxd2065xxx  is a preferential
cox-2 inhibitor, while ibuprofen has a relative higher
potency against cox-1 than cox-2 [19, 20]. the
question is whether this dierence in cox selectivity
results in diverse eects on renal function. if the cox-2
inhibitors are less nephrotoxic than cox-1 inhibitors,
one would expect  xxxd2065xxx  to aect renal function less
than ibuprofen. studies directly comparing the renal
eects of  xxxd2065xxx  and ibuprofen in healthy subjects
have not been reported until now.
the purpose of this study was to compare the eects
of 2 weeks of treatment with ibuprofen,  xxxd2065xxx  and
placebo on renal haemodynamics, tubular function
and the plasma levels of  xxxd3495xxx  (avp) and
renin (hormones with known impact on salt and water
homeostasis) in healthy subjects. in addition, we wanted
to clarify whether any of the treatments caused renal
injury when evaluated using measurement of urinary
excretion of albumin and alpha glutathione-s-transferase (a-gst).

materials and methods
subjects
healthy subjects more than 18 years of age were included in the
study. the exclusion criteria were heart diseases, liver diseases,
kidney diseases, arterial hypertension, peptic ulcers, neoplastic
diseases, medical treatment (excluding the contraceptive pill),
women of childbearing age not using reliable contraception, allergy
to nsaids or  xxxd234xxx , thrombocytopenia and bleeding
disorders.

all subjects were examined before inclusion in the study. their
medical history was assessed and a clinical examination performed
including measurement of blood pressure and electrocardiogram.
in addition, a laboratory screening was performed, i.e. blood
haemoglobin, blood white cell count, blood thrombocytes, plasma
sodium, plasma potassium, plasma creatinine, plasma glucose,
plasma albumin, plasma  xxxg941xxx , prothrombin
time, and a urine test strip for albumin, glucose and haemoglobin
was performed. the results of all the tests were required to be
normal before inclusion in the project.
the study was approved by the national board of health and
the local medical ethics committee. informed consents were obtained from all the participants.
design
eighteen healthy subjects were studied in a randomised, doubleblind, placebo-controlled crossover study, in which the subjects
received ibuprofen,  xxxd2065xxx  and placebo in three separate periods
each of 14 days. in between the treatment periods, a wash-out
period of at least 7 days' duration was interposed. at the end of
each treatment period, a clearance study was performed [determining glomerular ®ltration rate (gfr), renal plasma ¯ow (rpf)
and urinary excretion of sodium, potassium and lithium] and
plasma concentrations of renin and avp and urinary excretions of
albumin and a-gst were determined.
study medication
in three separate periods, each of 14 days, the participant was given
(1)  xxxd2065xxx  (todolac) tablets (300 mg) plus ibuprofen placebo
twice a day, (2) ibuprofen (ibuprofen dak) tablets (800 mg) plus
 xxxd2065xxx  placebo twice a day and (3) ibuprofen placebo plus  xxxd2065xxx  placebo twice a day, in random order. the last dose of
medication was given in the morning (at 0700 hours) on the day the
clearance study was carried out. the study medication for each
subject was packed in blister packs and numbered by the pharmaceutical company (leo pharmaceutical products, denmark).
the computer block randomisation was done by leo pharmaceutical products. successive numbers were given to the subjects at the
time they were included in the study. the subjects were asked to
bring the empty blister packs (or any remaining pills) on the
clearance study day.
todolac ( xxxd2065xxx )/placebo tablets were provided by leo
pharmaceutical products, and ibuprofen dak (ibuprofen)/placebo tablets were provided by nycomed, roskilde, denmark.
experimental procedure
the day before each clearance study a 24-h urinary collection was
performed. in the evening before the clearance study (at
2200 hours), the subject was given lithium carbonate (300 mg)
orally. the subject was instructed to fast overnight. on the study
day, an oral water load of 200 ml tap water every 30 min was
started at 0715 hours the subject arrived at the laboratory at
0800 hours. at 0815 hours, two indwelling catheters for blood
sampling and administration of tracers were placed in forearm
veins, one in each arm. at 0845 hours, two blood samples were
drawn for determination of avp and renin. immediately afterward, a priming dose of 51cr-ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid
(edta) and 125i-hippuran was given for the measurement of
gfr and rpf, followed by sustained infusions of both. during
the study, the subject remained supine except when voiding. the
subjects voided either in the standing or sitting position. from
0945 hours, urine was collected every 30 min, during four (i±iv)
consecutive clearance periods. blood samples were drawn every
30 min, i.e. at the beginning and end of each clearance period.
blood and urine samples were analysed for tracers, osmolality,
sodium, potassium and lithium. the 24-h urine collection was
analysed for microalbuminuria and urine a-gst.

methods

renal haemodynamics

gfr and rpf were measured using the constant infusion technique with 51cr-edta and 125i-hippuran as reference substances.
a priming dose ensured a serum activity of 200±600 cpm/ml for
51
cr-edta and 300±1000 cpm/ml for 125i-hippuran. serum activity was kept stable using constant infusion with an infusion
pump (vial medical, france). the gfrs of the ®rst two periods
were used to evaluate the bladder-emptying ability. complete
bladder emptying was de®ned as less than 15% variation in clearance of 51cr-edta. in case of incomplete emptying of the bladder,
the subject was excluded from the study.
avp in plasma was measured radioimmunologically using a
slight modi®cation of a method previously described [21]. radioimmunoassay was performed using a rabbit anti-avp antibody
that was kindly donated by jacques duèrr antibody, miami, florida. the coecients of variation were 9% (intraassay) and 13%
(interassay). the minimum detection level was 0.4 pmol/l.
renin in plasma (prc) was measured using a two-site immunoradiometric assay (nichols). the coecients of variation were
2.5% (intraassay) and 9.9% (interassay). the minimum detection
level was 1.4 lu/ml. serum and urinary concentrations of lithium
were measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (perkin-elmer, model 3100).
a-gst in urine was quanti®ed using an enzyme immunoassay
(biothrin nephkit, alpha, biothrin international, dublin, ireland).
the coecients of variation were 8.3% (intraassay) and 7.1%
(interassay). the minimum detection level was 0.6 lg/l.
plasma and urinary concentrations of creatinine, sodium and
potassium were measured using routine methods at the department
of clinical chemistry, skejby hospital, aarhus, denmark. urine
albumin was measured turbudimetrically using reagents from daco
a/s, copenhagen, and the analysis was performed at the department of clinical chemistry, skejby hospital. minimum detection
limit was 7 mg/l.
plasma and urinary osmolality was measured using freezing
point depression (advanced cryomatic osmometer, model 3c2).

gfr, rpf and ®ltration fraction are given in table 2.
there were no statistical dierences among the three
treatments (placebo, ibuprofen and  xxxd2065xxx ) in the effects on gfr, rpf and the ®ltration fraction.

calculations and statistics
the fractional excretion of the various substances measured (x) was
calculated from gfr and cx (clearance of x) according to the
equation: fex  cx =gfr  100 %. cx was calculated as the
ratio between the urinary excretion rate of x and the mean value of
the two plasma levels before and after each clearance period.
the eects of treatment with  xxxd2065xxx /ibuprofen/placebo on
gfr, rpf, urinary output, ®ltration fraction, clearance and
fractional excretion of sodium, potassium and lithium and free
water clearance in each clearance study were assessed using the
average values of the last three clearance periods (ii, iii and iv).
results, unless otherwise noted, are given as medians with ®rst
and third quartiles in parentheses. non-parametric tests were used
for statistical analysis. the friedman test was used for paired
comparisons within several groups followed by multiple comparison procedure based on the friedman test to compare individual treatments [22]. a value of p < 0.05 was considered
signi®cant.

results
demographic
clinical data of the subjects, who were included and
completed the study, are given in table 1. only one
subject was excluded after inclusion. she was going to
have an operation and was excluded after the ®rst period
of treatment. she was replaced by another subject.

tubular function
sodium clearance, fractional excretion of sodium,
potassium clearance, fractional excretion of potassium,
lithium clearance and fractional excretion of lithium
are given in table 2. the lithium clearance and the
fractional excretion of lithium decreased signi®cantly
after ibuprofen administration in comparison with the
results after both placebo and  xxxd2065xxx . ibuprofen induced a 16% ()28% to )10%) reduction in lithium
clearance compared with placebo (22.8 ml/min/1.73 m2
vs 27.4 ml/min/1.73 m2, p < 0.01) and a 17% ()23% to
)9%) reduction in the fractional excretion of lithium
compared with placebo (23.6% vs 28.1%, p < 0.01).
sodium clearance and fractional excretion of sodium did
not dier signi®cantly between the three treatments.
neither did we see any dierences in potassium clearance or fractional excretion of potassium. however
fractional excretions of sodium and potassium tended to
be lower after administration of ibuprofen than placebo.
urine volume, free water clearance
and 24-h sodium secretion
urinary output, free water clearance and 24-h sodium
excretion are given in table 2. there were no dierences
among the treatments in the urinary output or the free
water clearance, nor did the 24-h sodium excretion
change signi®cantly after  xxxd2065xxx  or ibuprofen treatment compared with placebo.

discussion
in this placebo-controlled, three-way crossover study,
neither ibuprofen nor  xxxd2065xxx  caused any changes in
renal haemodynamics, urinary output, free water clearance or urinary excretion of sodium and potassium after
14 days of treatment compared with placebo. however,
ibuprofen induced a reduction in lithium clearance and
the fractional excretion of lithium.
until now, no studies have directly compared the
renal eects of ibuprofen and  xxxd2065xxx  in man, only
studies including each of the drugs separately have been
done. brater et al. [23, 24] found a transient decrease in
electrolyte and water excretion after the ®rst dose of
 xxxd2065xxx , but no changes in renal function (including
gfr, rpf and fena) after 4 days of treatment in
healthy subjects or in patients with renal impairment. in
a study by murray et al. [25], the ®rst dose of ibuprofen
decreased gfr in elderly subjects with and without
renal impairment, but control values of gfr after
1 month of treatment did not alter from baseline in
either of the two groups. bergamo et al. [26] found no
acute eects of ibuprofen on renal function (rpf,
creatinine clearance and electrolyte excretion).
our results are in agreement with the results from
previous studies, in which chronic treatment with  xxxd2065xxx  or ibuprofen did not alter renal function in healthy
subjects. however, using the lithium clearance technique, we found that the re-absorption in the proximal
tubuli increased after 14 days of ibuprofen administration but not after  xxxd2065xxx , suggesting that cox-1 is
involved in the handling of sodium in the proximal
tubuli in the normo-volemic state. the net excretion of
sodium did not alter and a compensatory decreased reabsorption must have taken place more distally in the
nephron. our study was not designed to examine
the acute eects of  xxxd2065xxx  and ibuprofen on renal
function.

pgs (especially pge2 and pgi2) are known stimulators of renin release [1]. in the present study, ibuprofen
caused a reduction in prc. although a small decrease in
prc was also seen after  xxxd2065xxx , it did not dier signi®cantly from placebo.
in rats, cox-2 is constitutively expressed in the
macula densa and the expression is further induced by
chronic salt depletion [11]. in mice, the selective cox-2
inhibitor ns398 blocks the increase in renal renin content seen in response to low sodium diet [27]. the rodent
studies suggest that the increase in renal renin content
seen after sodium restriction requires induction of cox2. koèmho et al. [12] did not localise cox-2 to the
macula densa in adult human kidneys using immunohistology. they found cox-1 constitutively localised in
the endothelial cells of the aerent arteriole and suggested that cox-1 is involved in renin release by mediating the synthesis of pgi2.
in agreement with our study, brater et al. [24] found
no eect of  xxxd2065xxx  on the basal plasma renin activity
(pra) after 4 days of treatment in normal subjects. in
other studies, basal and stimulated renin decreased in
healthy subjects after treatment with relative speci®c
cox-1 inhibitors, e.g. ibuprofen, indomethacin and
 xxxd3259xxx  [28, 29]. strichtenoth et al. [30] found no eect
of  xxxd2561xxx  (a cox-2-speci®c inhibitor) and indomethacin on the basal pra in healthy volunteers. in
contrast, they found that both  xxxd2561xxx  and indomethacin inhibited the furosemide-induced pra increase, suggesting that cox-2 is involved.
the results of the present study and the results from
the studies mentioned above suggest that cox-1 is involved in the synthesis of pg responsible for renin release under normal (basal) conditions in healthy
humans. in contrast, cox-2 may be involved in the
stimulated renin release seen under certain conditions,
such as salt restriction, dehydration and diuretic treatment. it is not yet known whether cox-2 is induced in
the macula densa in humans under such conditions.
renin release may be inhibited by vasopressin. avp
did not change after administration of nsaids in the
present study. to eliminate the eect of water loading,
avp was analysed on a blood sample drawn at the beginning of the clearance study day.
with regard to the above discussion, it must be remembered that neither ibuprofen nor  xxxd2065xxx  are
completely selective inhibitors of cox-1 or cox-2.
most in vitro studies have shown that ibuprofen has a
higher potency against cox-1 than cox-2 and that
 xxxd2065xxx  has a high selectivity toward cox-2. however,
the values of the relative selectivity (ic50) of ibuprofen
and  xxxd2065xxx  dier among the studies depending on the
method used [14, 19, 20, 31]. recently, warner et al. [32]
compared the abilities of more than 40 nsaids to inhibit cox-1 versus cox-2 in human cells. they compared both ic50 and ic80 ratios of the drugs. they
found that ibuprofen had poor cox selectivity, while
 xxxd2065xxx  was a preferential cox-2 inhibitor. however,
nsaids with preferential selectivity against cox-2

were also capable of producing full inhibition of cox-1.
due to the fact that the compounds used in our study
were not completely selective cox-1 and cox-2 inhibitors, it is not possible to dierentiate the renal eects
of cox-1 and cox-2 fully.
the urinary excretion of albumin did not dier
among the three treatment periods in this study, suggesting that therapeutic doses of nsaids cause no
glomerular injury. albumin is normally ®ltered in small
amounts in the glomeruli and reabsorbed in the proximal tubuli.
the  xxxg1073xxx  are involved in the detoxi®cation of
endogenous and exogenous substances. the dierent
isozymes are found in most tissues in the body [33] and
are measurable in the blood [34]. in the kidney, a-gst
is localised to the cytosol of the proximal tubuli cells
[35, 36], and previous studies suggested that increases
in urinary a-gst indicate injury localised to the
proximal tubuli [36±38]. we found no increase in urinary a-gst after  xxxd2065xxx  or ibuprofen, but ibuprofen
caused a decrease in the 24-h urinary excretion of the
enzyme. in vitro studies have shown that nsaids inhibit the activity of  xxxg1073xxx  in the rat liver and hamster
ovary cell line [39±41]. however, in the small intestine
of rats, ibuprofen (among other nsaids) induces agst [42]. the decrease in urinary a-gst seen in our
study could be a result of an inhibition of the enzyme
by ibuprofen.
in conclusion, a 14-day administration of  xxxd2065xxx  or
ibuprofen in therapeutic doses did not aect the renal
haemodynamics, the net excretion of electrolytes or the
urinary excretion of albumin in healthy subjects. however, ibuprofen, in contrast to  xxxd2065xxx , decreased lithium excretion suggesting that cox-1 is involved in the
handling of sodium and water in the proximal tubuli.
furthermore, ibuprofen caused a reduction in prc,
suggesting that cox-1 is involved in basal renin release
in humans. ibuprofen also reduced the urinary excretion
of a-gst, suggesting that ibuprofen inhibits the detoxi®cation enzyme. overall, the study indicates that only
small dierences in the eects of the two drugs on renal
function in healthy subjects exist.
