1 in humans intimal thickening is a prerequisite of atherosclerosis. application of a silicone collar
around the rabbit carotid artery induces an intimal thickening but in addition it increases the
sensitivity to the vasoconstrictor action of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht). the 5-ht
receptors involved in collar-induced hypersensitivity to 5-ht were investigated using several agonists
and antagonists.
2 one week after placement of collars around both carotid arteries of anaesthetized rabbits, rings
(2 mm width) from inside (=collar) and outside (=sham) the collars were mounted in organ baths
(10 ml) for isometric force measurements at 6 g loading tension.
3 collared rings were more sensitive to the contractile eect of 5-ht (7.6 fold) and 5carboxamidotryptamine (31 fold, 5-ct, 5-ht1 agonist) in cumulative concentration response curves.
sumatriptan (5-ht1b/1d agonist) caused concentration-dependent constrictions in collared rings only.
4 collar placement did not signi®cantly alter pa2 values (schild regression) or apparent pkb values
(non-linear regression) of spiperone and  xxxd2621xxx  (mixed 5-ht2a/5-ht1 antagonists) or
 xxxd2419xxx  and ritanserin (5-ht2a antagonists), indicating unchanged binding characteristics of the
 xxxg1113xxx . however, the reduced slope of the schild regression pointed to a heterogeneous
receptor population in collared rings.
5 in contrast, the apparent pkb value of methiothepin (5-ht1b antagonist) was signi®cantly
reduced by collar placement, and its antagonism shifted from non-surmountable in sham rings to
surmountable in collared segments.
6 taken together, this study demonstrates that the serotonergic receptor involved in the
hypersensitivity to 5-ht of rabbit collared carotid artery is a  xxxg1109xxx  subtype.

introduction
patients with atherosclerosis are prone to the development of
vasospasm to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht) (hillis &
lange, 1991; golino et al., 1991; chester et al., 1993;
mcfadden et al., 1991) even when the atherosclerotic lesions
are not angiographically detectable (vrints et al., 1992). a
similar hyperactivity to 5-ht develops when the rabbit carotid
artery is surrounded by a ¯exible, silicone collar to induce
intimal thickening (de meyer et al., 1990; 1994; sobey et al.,
1991). in human arteries intimal thickening is an essential
prerequisite for the development of atherosclerosis (stary et
al., 1995). nevertheless three observations revealed that the
hypersensitivity to 5-ht and intimal hyperplasia are separate
responses to the damage of the media (de meyer et al., 1997)
evoked by the collar. the hypersensitivity to 5-ht preceded
the development of intimal hyperplasia (dusting et al., 1990;
de meyer et al., 1990); treatment with the glucocorticoid
dexamethasone prevented intimal thickening, while raising the
hypersensitivity to 5-ht even further (van put et al., 1995),
whereas treatment with the calcium entry blocker verapamil
had the opposite eect: it normalized the supersensitivity to

5-ht without aecting intimal hyperplasia (uèstuènes et al.,
1996).
the broad spectrum of cardiovascular eects of 5-ht is
mediated through a variety of 5-ht receptor subtypes (martin,
1994). in blood vessels 5-ht stimulates sympathetic nerves,
the endothelium (cocks & angus, 1983) and vascular smooth
muscle cells (grandaw & purdy, 1996). in normal rabbit
carotid arteries vasoconstriction is a consequence of 5-ht2a
receptor stimulation, when a1-adrenoceptors are not taken into
consideration (black et al., 1981; yildiz & tuncer, 1994).
activation of 5-ht1b/1d receptors evokes constrictions in
endothelium-denuded human (kaumann et al., 1994), pig
(kadokami et al., 1996), guinea-pig (ellwood & curtis, 1997a)
and rabbit (feletou et al., 1994; ellwood & curtis, 1997b)
coronary arteries. furthermore, a signi®cant part of the
contraction to 5-ht is mediated by 5-ht1-like receptors when
rabbit femoral (maclennan & martin, 1992; randall et al.,
1996), iliac and mesenteric (yildiz & tuncer, 1994) arteries are
pre-contracted with a low concentration of  xxxg99xxx , a
thromboxane a2 mimetic or prostaglandin f2a before adding
5-ht. however, using the same strategy, yildiz & tuncer
(1994) failed to ®nd evidence for functional 5-ht1-like
receptors on vascular smooth muscle or endothelium in the
normal rabbit carotid artery. the question arose whether

1328

i.s. geerts et al

receptor changes were responsible for the observed hypersensitivity in the collared carotid artery of the rabbit. therefore
the aim of our study was to dissect possible alterations of the
vascular serotonergic receptor subtype(s) in this rabbit model
using a pharmacological approach with dierent agonists and
antagonists.

methods
experimental model
the experiments were approved by the ethical committee of
the university. male new zealand white rabbits (2.2 ± 3.5 kg)
were fed on standard laboratory chow throughout the
acclimatization, which lasted at least 1 week, and the
experiment. after anaesthesia with sodium pentobarbitone
(30 mg kg71, i.v., stock solution (60 mg ml71) diluted with 1
volume pyrogen-free sterile 0.9% nacl) both carotid arteries
were surgically exposed. once the vessels had been dissected
from the surrounding tissue, a ¯exible, non-occlusive,
biological inert, silicone collar (inlet/outlet diameter 1.8 mm,
20 mm length; silicone med-4211, nusil technology, u.s.a.)
was placed around each carotid artery and closed with silicone
glue (dow corning 732, dow corning corp., u.s.a.) (kockx
et al., 1992; de meyer et al., 1997). one week later the rabbits
were anaesthetized again and both carotid arteries were
excised. thereafter the rabbits were sacri®ced (overdose
sodium pentobarbitone, 60 mg kg71, i.v.). the collar and
loose connective tissue were removed carefully from the
arteries which were immediately placed in cold gassed krebsringer solution.

vascular reactivity
segments (2 mm width) from the region inside (collar) and
outside (sham) the collar were mounted horizontally on two
parallel tungsten wire hooks in organ baths (10 ml) ®lled with
krebs-ringer solution (378c, continuously gassed with 95%
o2 ± 5% co2) for force measurements at 6 g loading tension.
as the segments outside the collar had been manipulated
during collar implantation, they are designated sham rather
than control throughout the text. after 45 min equilibration,
during which the loading tension was readjusted when
necessary, the study of the reactivity of the segments was
started. tension was measured isometrically with a statham
uc2 force transducer (gould, cleveland, u.s.a.) connected to
a data acquisition system (moise 3, emka technologies,
paris, france). between each concentration-response curve
(crc) the krebs-ringer solution was replaced three times to
washout the agents. the rings were ®rst contracted with a
depolarizing potassium solution (50 mm). after washout this
was followed by a cumulative crc to the agonist in the
absence of antagonists. then, the arterial rings were incubated
with the lowest concentration of the antagonist for 30 min,
upon which a crc to the agonist was performed. this was
repeated twice, each time with an increasing concentration of
the antagonist. in each experiment one sham and one collared
segment did not receive any antagonist, to allow for correction
of time eects. each ring was exposed to one antagonist only
and the number of carotid arteries reported (n) equals the
number of rabbits used. for kcl responses and the ®rst 5-ht
crc the average of the four rings from each rabbit was
calculated and used for statistical analysis.
to exclude interference by metabolism and uptake of 5-ht,
all experiments were carried out in the presence of inhibitors

 xxxg1109xxx  and the rabbit collared carotid artery

mono-amino-oxidase ( xxxd2850xxx , 0.15 mm) (verbeuren et al.,
1988), neuronal uptake (clomipramine, 30 nm) and extraneuronal uptake ( xxxd1754xxx , 10 mm) (ellwood &
curtis, 1997b). to avoid the in¯uence of adrenergic receptors,
a1- and a2-adrenoceptor antagonists (respectively  xxxd3000xxx  and
idazoxan, both 1 mm) (valentin et al., 1996) were added to the
bath solution. the vasoactive prostanoids and the endothelial
 xxxd2738xxx  production was hindered by supplementing the salt
solution with inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase (indomethacin,
3 mm) (de meyer et al., 1991) and  xxxd2738xxx  synthase ( xxxd2741xxx -arginine, 300 mm) (de meyer et al., 1994).
at the end of the vascular reactivity tests the segments were
®xed (formaldehyde 4% solution) and stained with hematoxylin/eosin. intimal thickness (measured at 20 at random sites
covering the whole ring and averaged per artery) was
determined on one transverse section at 4006 magni®cation
using a computer assisted color image analysis (pc image
color, foster findlay associates, newcastle-upon-tyne,
u.k.).

calculation of pd2, pa2 and apparent pkb-values
the kcl (50 mm) responses were used to normalize for the
contractile capacity of each individual ring. furthermore, a
time dependent decrease in the maximum of the crc to 5-ht
was observed. therefore all the results were corrected using the
following equation:
ea 0  t ea =ekcl 100

1

where ea' is the corrected eect (% contraction), ea the
contraction induced by the agonist, ekcl the contraction
evoked by 50 mm kcl and t a correction factor. t was
calculated for every crc in sham and collared ring by
determining the ratio emax /emax where emax is the maximum
response to the agonist in the ®rst curve and emax the
maximum in ®rst, second, third, fourth curve respectively of
the simultaneous time control, i.e. rings not receiving
antagonists. ec50 values (pd2=7log ec50) were obtained
from individual concentration response curves by ®tting the
corrected data (ea') to the four parameter logistic equation:
1

n

1

n

ea 0  emin  emax ÿ emin =
1  10 ^  log ec50 ÿlog anh 

2

where ea' is the eect after correction, a the concentration of
the agonist, emin the minimum or initial contraction, emax the
maximum contraction, nh the hill slope and ec50 the
concentration of the agonist giving half the maximal
contraction. the curve ®tting was carried out using prism
version 2.01 (graphpad software, san diego, ca, u.s.a.).
to classify the 5-ht receptor types present in the vessel the
pa2 values of each antagonist were calculated using linear
regression and the equation developed by schild (arunlakshana & schild, 1959; tallarida et al., 1979). theoretically the
pa2 value of a given antagonist is expected to be independent
of the eector tissue and the agonist used to stimulate a
particular receptor. so within the same tissue (i.e. rabbit
carotid artery) the pa2 values were expected to be similar in
both experimental conditions (sham or collar) unless the
receptor characteristics had been changed by the collar
placement.
recently a non-linear regression method has been proposed
to estimate apparent pkb values (peeters, 1998). the
parameters describing the surmountable (pkb) and nonsurmountable (pd2') portion of the inhibition provoked by
an antagonist are estimated from the whole set of concentra-

following equation:

where ea' is the normalized eect, a the concentration of the
agonist, b the concentration of the antagonist, emax the
maximal contraction, nh the hill slope of the crc without
antagonist. the curve ®tting was carried out using table curve
3d (spss asc gmbh, ekrath, germany). in comparison to
the schild method (arunlakshana & schild, 1959) this model
has the advantages that it incorporates non-surmountable
antagonism, uses all available data instead of a single point
(i.e. the ec50) of the crc, takes curves in which the dose-ratio
is less than unity into consideration and does not attribute
extra weight to the ®rst crc (peeters, 1998).

statistical analysis
the collared rings were compared to their proximal sham
equivalents (same vessel) by paired student's t-test. to
determine the eect of an antagonist within one group (i.e.
sham or collared rings) the normalized (%kcl) contractions
were evaluated by means of a two-way analysis of variance
(anova) with the antagonist as column factor and the
concentration of agonist as row factor. when the interaction
between the two factors in the two-way anova was
statistically signi®cant, an additional one-way anova of the
7log ec50 values and the emax values, followed by dunnett's
multiple comparison post-hoc test, was performed. the pa2
and apparent pkb values obtained in sham and collared rings
were compared by unpaired student's t-test. the graphpad
prism package was applied for these purposes. a probability of
error less than 0.05 was selected as the criterion for statistical
signi®cance. all data are given as the mean+standard error of
the mean (s.e.mean).

eect of serotonergic agonists
5-ht (1 nm ± 0.1 mm), 5-ct (0.1 nm ± 10 mm), a preferential 5ht1 receptor agonist (martin, 1994), l694,247, a selective  xxxg1110xxx  agonist (beer et al., 1993), (1 nm ± 0.1 mm) and 8-ohdpat, a selective 5-ht1a agonist (glennon et al., 1988),
(1 nm ± 0.1 mm) induced concentration-dependent contractions in isolated sham and collared carotid arteries. in
accordance with yildiz & tuncer (1994) sumatriptan, a 5ht1b/1d agonist (miller et al., 1992), (1 nm ± 0.1 mm) did not
elicit contractions in sham-operated rabbit carotid arteries, but
concentration-dependent constrictions could be seen in
collared rings, though the top concentration was insucient
to reach a plateau. the collared rings were signi®cantly more
sensitive to 5-ht (7.6 fold), 5-ct (31 fold), sumatriptan and
l694,247 (2.6 fold) than sham segments (figure 1 and table
1). repeated administration of the 5-ht1 receptor agonists 5ct, l694,247, 8-oh-dpat and sumatriptan gave rise to the
same maximum contraction and identical pd2 values of the
agonist (results not shown). however, a time dependent
decrease in the maximum of the crc to 5-ht was observed.
therefore all the results obtained with the agonist 5-ht have
been corrected for this time eect. in sham arteries the decrease
was 9+6, 19+5 and 30+6% for respectively the second, third
and fourth crc. in collared segments the decrease of the
maximum response was signi®cantly less and respectively 5+3,
4+3 and 11+3% for the second, third and fourth crc. the
crc to 5-ht and 5-ct were less steep as shown by the
signi®cant reduction of the hill coecients in collared
segments (table 1).

parallel concentration-dependent rightward shifts of the 5-htinduced contractions in sham and collared rings while the
maximum responses were maintained. the inhibition was
competitive, surmountable and statistically signi®cant for all
concentrations tested (figure 2).  xxxd1891xxx  and 100 nm  xxxd2419xxx 
appeared to exert a similar competitive surmountable
antagonism to 5-ct in sham and collared rings. a higher
concentration (1 mm) of  xxxd2419xxx  resulted in a complete
inhibition of 5-ct induced contraction in sham segments and a
depression of the maximum response in collared rings (figure
4a).
ritanserin (1, 10 and 100 nm), a selective  xxxg1113xxx 
antagonist (conolan et al., 1986; van nueten et al., 1986),
reduced both the sensitivity and the maximal response to 5-ht
in sham and collared segments pointing to a competitive but
non-surmountable antagonism. however, collared segments
seemed to be more resistant to the non-surmountable
antagonism as 1 nm ritanserin did not reduce the maximum
(figure 3) and the depression of the emax was less pronounced
 xxxd1891xxx  and 100 nm ritanserin. in sham segments the
constrictions to 5-ct were progressively suppressed by 1, 10
and 100 nm ritanserin. in collar segments the antagonism of 5ct contractions did not occur at 1 nm, and was still
surmountable  xxxd1891xxx  nm ritanserin. only 100 nm ritanserin
induced non-surmountable antagonism in collared segments
(figure 4b).

dependently the sensitivity to serotonin, but did not in¯uence
the maximal response reached. they acted as competitive,
surmountable antagonists in sham and collared rings (table 2).
in sham rings methiothepin (0.1, 1 and 10 nm), a
preferential rabbit 5-ht1b (bard et al., 1996) and 5-ht2a
receptor antagonist, caused concentration-dependent rightward displacements of the 5-ht curves and depression of the
maximal response. in contrast, methiothepin produced a dosedependent rightward shift of the 5-ht curves without
depression of the maximum in collar segments (figure 5).
this indicates that collar placement had changed the type of
antagonism for methiothepin from non-surmountable to
competitive surmountable. a similar phenomenon was
observed when 5-ct was used as agonist (figure 5).
nan-190 (0.01, 0.1 and 1 mm), a speci®c  xxxg1108xxx 
antagonist (glennon et al., 1988), did not induce any
statistically signi®cant inhibition of the responses to 5-ct in
sham and collared arteries (table 3). in collared rings only,
cyanopindolol (0.01, 0.1 and 1 mm), a 5-ht1a and 5-ht1b
receptor antagonist (giles et al., 1996), signi®cantly shifted the

according to the schild analysis spiperone and  xxxd2621xxx 
were competitive surmountable antagonists in sham rings as
the slopes did not dier from unity (table 4). their pa2 values
were not in¯uenced by the collar (p40.05, unpaired student's
t-test). in contrast, collar placement reduced the slope of
spiperone and  xxxd2621xxx , which became signi®cantly
dierent from unity. the schild slopes of  xxxd2419xxx  and
ritanserin deviated slightly from unity in sham rings, whereas
the collar led to a signi®cant suppression. the suppression of
the 5-ht responses by methiothepin was apparently not due to
a simple, surmountable competitive antagonism, since the
schild slopes deviated signi®cantly from unity. the schild
slope of methiothepin was strongly reduced by the collar.
since the schild analysis indicated that none of the
antagonists behaved as a pure surmountable, competitive
antagonist in collared rings, non-linear regression was used to
estimate apparent pkb values according to the model described
by peeters (1998). in sham operated rings the apparent pkb
values were not dierent from the pa2 values for drugs
( xxxd2621xxx , spiperone) which displayed pure competitive
surmountable antagonism and compounds ( xxxd2419xxx , ritanserin) which deviated only slightly from the schild regression.
on the other hand for drugs which displayed an anomalous
schild regression, the apparent pkb was signi®cantly larger
(methiothepin) than the (incorrect) estimate of the pa2 (table
4). in the collared rings the pa2 and apparent pkb values were
not dierent for antagonists acting preferentially on 5-ht2a
receptors ( xxxd2419xxx , ritanserin and  xxxd2621xxx ). the
apparent pkb values of methiothepin were smaller than the
corresponding pa2 values in collar rings. finally, the apparent
pkb values of  xxxd2419xxx  and ritanserin were similar in sham
and collared rings (table 4). in contrast, collar placement
signi®cantly decreased the apparent pkb value of methiothepin
(table 4, p50.0001, unpaired student's t-test).

discussion
first of all our results con®rmed the previous reports, i.e.
decreased contractile responses to 50 mm kcl and increased
sensitivity to 5-ht in rabbit carotid arteries surrounded by a
¯exible collar (figure 1; table 1) (sobey et al., 1991; de meyer
et al., 1990) and extended those observations by demonstrating
that the hypersensitivity occurred in the presence of inhibitors
of serotonin uptake and metabolism, as well as a-adrenoceptor
blockers. therefore, it seems likely that the changes are to a
large extent due to functional changes of 5-ht receptors.
previous studies reported the presence of 5-ht2a and 5-ht1like receptors in rabbit femoral arteries (grandaw & purdy,
1996; randall et al., 1996; maclennan & martin, 1992), but
functional evidence for 5-ht1-like receptors was not found in
the rabbit carotid artery (yildiz & tuncer, 1994). moreover,
the involvement of 5-ht3 and  xxxg1117xxx  receptors was ruled out

by the present experiments with mdl 72222, a selective 5-ht3
receptor antagonist, and the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonist gr
113808a. both antagonists failed to in¯uence the 5-ht
induced vasoconstriction in sham or collared segments (table
2) indicating that 5-ht3 and  xxxg1117xxx  receptors do not contribute
to the vasomotor responses to exogenous 5-ht in either
condition. the presence of 5-ht2a receptors in normal rabbit
carotid arteries (yildiz & tuncer, 1994) was con®rmed by the
response to the  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists. as there were
rightward displacements of the 5-ht crcs by  xxxd2419xxx 
(figure 2), spiperone,  xxxd2621xxx  and ritanserin (figure 3),
the  xxxg1113xxx  appears to be functionally involved in the
response to 5-ht. since the anity of  xxxd2419xxx , ritanserin
and  xxxd2621xxx  was not changed by the collar, as shown by
the apparent pkb values (table 4), it is assumed that the
binding characteristics of this  xxxg1113xxx  remained
unchanged in collared arteries. this assumption was further
con®rmed by the unaltered pa2 of spiperone and  xxxd2621xxx . yet, these data do not exclude that the number of 5-ht2a
receptors or the receptor-response coupling was changed by
the collar.
stimulation of the carotid artery with 5-ct, a preferential
5-ht1 agonist, revealed that collared rings are 30 times more
sensitive than the sham ones (figure 1b). since  xxxd2419xxx  and
ritanserin are selective 5-ht2a antagonists at nanomolar
concentrations (van nueten et al., 1986; le & martin,

1986), the response observed in sham segments is presumably
due to activation of 5-ht2a receptors by high concentrations
of 5-ct as incubation with nanomolar concentrations of
 xxxd2419xxx  (figure 4a) and ritanserin (figure 4b), signi®cantly
reduced those contractions. in contrast collared rings were
more resistant to the 5-ht2 blockers and at nanomolar
concentrations  xxxd2419xxx  and ritanserin did not signi®cantly
alter the 5-ct induced contractions. this means that increased
5-ht1 receptor activity is the basis for the hypersensitivity to
5-ht in collared rings. three arguments strengthened this
hypothesis. first, the signi®cantly lower hill coecients of the
crcs to 5-ht and 5-ct in collared segments indicated that
the curves were less steep. this is compatible with the idea that
two receptor populations with dierent anities for either
agonist participated in the contractile responses of collared
segments. secondly, all antagonists displayed a reduced slope
of the schild regression in collared segments, which points to
either the presence of heterogeneous receptors, or a nonequilibrium steady state in the tissue due to uptake of
metabolism of the agonist (kenakin, 1993). since care had
been taken to eliminate uptake and metabolism of 5-ht, the
slope of the schild regression for the four antagonists of less
than unity could signify heterogeneous receptor populations in
collared rings according to kenakin (1985). third, the time
dependent decrease of the maximum response was only
observed for 5-ht, which stimulates both 5-ht2a and 5-ht1

i.s. geerts et al

 xxxg1109xxx  and the rabbit collared carotid artery

receptors, but not with more selective 5-ht1 receptor agonists
(5-ct, sumatriptan). since the reduction of the maximum
response to 5-ht was less pronounced in collared rings, this
suggests that the contribution of 5-ht1 receptors to the 5-htinduced constrictions became more pronounced in collared
rings when compared to sham segments.
the 5-ht1 receptor family is divided into ®ve major
subtypes: 5-ht1a, 5-ht1b,  xxxg1110xxx ,  xxxg1111xxx  and  xxxg1112xxx . the
physiological role of  xxxg1111xxx  and  xxxg1112xxx  receptors has not yet
been identi®ed (martin, 1998) and there were no selective tools

available to investigate the signi®cance of the receptors in our
study. nevertheless, the presence of functional  xxxg1111xxx  and  xxxg1112xxx 
receptors seems unlikely since 5-ct is far less potent than 5ht as agonist for both  xxxg1111xxx  and  xxxg1112xxx  expressed in
recombinant mammalian cells systems (5-ht4ru2496948oh-dpat45-ct>sumatriptan; n-dimethyl-5-ht4sumatriptan45-ct respectively) (gerhardt & van heerikhuizen,
1997; martin, 1998) whereas pd2 values of 5-ht and 5-ct
were of a similar magnitude in sham as well as in collared
rings. the involvement of 5-ht1a receptors is ruled out by two
experimental results: 8-oh-dpat, a selective 5-ht1a agonist,
required extremely high concentrations (10 mm, figure 1d and
table 1) to induce only a modest contraction of sham and
collared rings. these responses are presumably the consequence of  xxxg1113xxx  stimulation in view of the pki of 8oh-dpat (pki=5.0) for 5-ht2a receptors (van wijngaarden
et al., 1990). furthermore, nan-190, a selective 5-ht1a
receptor antagonist, did not in¯uence the contractile response
to 5-ct in either sham or collared segments (table 3). in
contrast, sumatriptan, a 5-ht1b/1d agonist, induced constrictions in collared vessels only (figure 1c). cyanopindolol, a  xxxg1108xxx  and  xxxg1109xxx  antagonist, did not signi®cantly
alter the response to 5-ct in sham segments (table 3).
however, a signi®cant rightward shift of the 5-ct curves was
induced in collared rings (table 3) pointing to  xxxg1109xxx 
antagonism in view of the results obtained with nan-190 and
8-oh-dpat. both ®ndings indicate that collar placement
leads to up-regulation of 5-ht1b and/or  xxxg1110xxx  receptors
which are scarcely present in normal rabbit carotid arteries
(black et al., 1981; yildiz & tuncer, 1994). this was further
con®rmed by the dierences in antagonistic activity of the 5ht1b antagonist methiothepin, which was non-surmountable
in sham segments, but became surmountable in collared rings.
an increased receptor reserve may explain the dierent pro®les
of methiothepin in sham and collared vessels (figure 5) and the
resistance of the collared rings to the inhibitory eect of
ritanserin (figure 4b) on contractions induced by 5-ct. when
a large number of spare receptors exists, some drugs display
competitive surmountable antagonism, whereas with a limited
receptor reserve a non-surmountable antagonism occurs
(tallarida et al., 1979).

an attempt was made to discriminate between the
involvement of 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors.  xxxd2419xxx  and
ritanserin are, besides selective 5-ht2a antagonists at
nanomolar concentrations (van nueten et al., 1986; le &
martin, 1986),  xxxg1110xxx  antagonists at micromolar concentrations (kaumann et al., 1994; peroutka, 1994; pauwels &
colpaert, 1995; kaumann et al., 1993). however other studies
have shown that the ability of  xxxd2419xxx  and ritanserin to
dierentiate between 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  is doubtful.
 xxxd2419xxx  and ritanserin exhibit a 70 (zgombick et al.,
1995; bard et al., 1996) and 20 (zgombick et al., 1995) fold
anity dierences between human cloned 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx 
receptors. therefore, as suggested by ellwood & curtis
(1997b), methiothepin served as antagonist for rabbit 5-ht1b
receptors (not human) (bard et al., 1996; zgombick et al.,
1996). the collared rings displayed a decreased anity for
methiothepin as indicated by the apparent pkb values (table
4), again suggesting changes in the contribution of the 5-ht1b
receptor population. although, l694,247, a selective  xxxg1110xxx 
agonist (beer et al., 1993), induced constrictions in both sham
and collared arteries, these responses were presumably due to
 xxxg1113xxx  stimulation because the 7log(ec50) (5.5) was
more than 1000 fold higher than the anity value reported for
cloned  xxxg1110xxx  receptors (10.0) (walsh et al., 1995).
taken together these results suggest that contractile
responses to 5-ht are primarily mediated by 5-ht2a receptors
in normal rabbit carotid arteries, and that an up-regulation of
the  xxxg1109xxx  activity explains the increased sensitivity

to 5-ht in collared arteries. nevertheless, these functional
observations ought to be con®rmed on a molecular level by
determining the expression of rabbit 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx 
receptors at mrna and protein level. moreover, besides an
increase in number of 5-ht1b receptors, a more ecient 5-ht1
receptor-induced signal transduction as well as an altered
cellular calcium metabolism may be involved. as rabbit 5ht1b receptor shows greater than 90% sequence homology to
cloned human  xxxg1109xxx  (bard et al., 1996; gerhardt &
van heerikhuizen, 1997; wurch et al., 1996) and the activation
of 5-ht1b is involved in 5-ht-induced constriction of human
coronary artery (kaumann et al., 1994), this model could
provide new insights into the pathophysiology and the
treatment of human coronary vasospasm.
in conclusion, this study indicates that the serotonergic
receptor involved in the increased sensitivity to 5-ht of the
rabbit collared carotid arteries is a  xxxg1109xxx  subtype.
yet it has to be determined whether an increased number of
receptors or an enhanced receptor-signal transduction causes
the hypersensitivity to 5-ht.
