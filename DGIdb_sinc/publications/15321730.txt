abstract
we studied the effects of  xxxd444xxx  ( xxxd444xxx ) on the intracellular ca2+ concentration ([ca2+]i) in pc12 cells
using fura-2 fluorescence imaging.  xxxd444xxx  (100 am) caused a delayed increase in [ca2+]i that developed within ~3 h. this effect was
enhanced in cells that were pretreated with an inhibitor of glutathione (gsh) synthesis,  xxxd396xxx  (bso, 200 am, 24 h), and
was suppressed in cells that were treated with an antioxidant  xxxd1824xxx  (50 am). the  xxxd444xxx -induced increase in [ca2+]i was
absolutely dependent on the presence of extracellular ca2+ and could be inhibited by dihydropyridine blockers of l-type voltage-gated ca2+
channels ( xxxd2728xxx  or  xxxd2737xxx , 10 am). the increase in [ca2+]i was also suppressed in cl -free solution and in the presence of the cl
channel blockers, indanyloxyacetic acid 94 (iaa-94, 100 am) and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) xxxd306xxx  ( xxxg1585xxx , 100 am). the
inhibition was complete when the blockers were applied simultaneously with  xxxd444xxx  and was partial when the blockers were applied after
the initial increase in [ca2+]i. we conclude that  xxxd444xxx  induces an influx of extracellular ca2+ through l-type ca2+ channels and that this
effect is mediated by oxidative stress that results from the depletion of gsh following the inhibition by  xxxd444xxx  of  xxxg981xxx .

1. introduction
 xxxd444xxx  ( xxxd444xxx ) is an
antineoplastic agent that is widely used in the chemotherapy
of brain tumors. it is generally accepted that the cytostatic
effects of  xxxd444xxx  result primarily from the generation of
dna interstrand cross-links (e.g., ueda-kawamitsu et al.,
2002). in addition,  xxxd444xxx  has also been shown to
inhibit  xxxg981xxx , the enzyme that catalyzes the
recycling of  xxxd2213xxx  (gsh) from oxidized
 xxxd2811xxx  ( xxxd2811xxx ) (frischer and ahmad, 1977);
this action was proposed to contribute to both the
therapeutic and toxic effects of  xxxd444xxx . the inhibition
of  xxxg981xxx  results in the depletion of gsh and

the accumulation of  xxxd2811xxx  (e.g., smith and boyd, 1984; ma
et al., 2003), which is likely to compromise cellular
oxidative defenses that rely on antioxidant actions of
 xxxd2213xxx  (meister, 1994). indeed, carmustinetreated cells have been reported to be more vulnerable to
oxidative stress (e.g., ma et al., 2003). in many instances,
the link between oxidative stress and cell death is mediated
by ca2+ signaling (see reviews by lounsbury et al., 2000;
ermak and davies, 2002). in pc12 cells, decreased levels of
cellular gsh have been linked to the increased production
of reactive oxygen species, calcium disregulation and cell
death (jurma et al., 1997; pereira and oliveira, 1997;
froissard et al., 1997).
we recently found that  xxxd444xxx  caused the death of
pc12 cells and that this effect depended on the presence of
extracellular calcium (doroshenko and doroshenko, 2003).
this observation suggested that the toxic effect of  xxxd444xxx  may be mediated by an influx of ca2+ ions. the present
study was undertaken to directly test this hypothesis and to

2.1. cell culture
pc12 cells were grown at 37 8c in 25-cm2 flasks in the
rpmi-1640 cell culture medium supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum and
antibiotics (sigma, st. louis, mo) in a humidified 95% air,
5% co2 incubator. for the imaging experiments, cells were
detached by vigorous shaking, dispersed by 3 passing
through a 25g needle, and plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated
glass-bottom 35-mm petri dishes (mattek, ashland, ma).
cells were used 24–48 h after plating.

 xxxd444xxx , d,l-buthionine-[s,r]-sulfoximine (bso),
 xxxd1824xxx  salt, indanyloxyacetic acid 94
(iaa-94),  xxxd2122xxx  (n-(3-[trifluoromethyl]phenyl) xxxd189xxx ), 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic
acid ( xxxg1585xxx ),  xxxd2737xxx  and  xxxd2728xxx  were purchased
from sigma. fura-2/am was purchased from molecular
probes (eugene, or). stock solutions of  xxxd444xxx  (20 mm
in h2o) and the ion channel blockers (in ethanol or dimethyl
sulfoxide) were kept as frozen aliquots at 20 8c until use.
the final concentrations of ethanol and  xxxd1896xxx  in
the test solutions did not exceed 0.1%; in control experiments, neither solvent at this concentration had any effect on
fura-2 fluorescence.

2.2. fluorescence measurements
2.5. statistics
for ca2+ imaging, pc12 cells were loaded with the
fluorescent ca2+ indicator fura-2 by incubation for 30
min at room temperature in the presence of 2 am
membrane-permeable fura-2/am. thereafter, the cells
were washed, and the petri dish with the attached cells
was mounted on the stage of a zeiss axiovert 100
inverted epifluorescence microscope that was equipped
with a fluar 40, 1.3 na oil immersion objective lens
and a 75 w xenon light source. sequential images were
acquired at 510 nm after alternative excitation at 340 and
380 nm using an analog integrating ccd camera (cohu
4915-2000, cohu, san diego, ca) connected to a
computer via an 8-bit frame grabber (dt3155, data
translation, marlboro, ma). illumination via a lambda
10-c filter wheel and shutter (sutter instruments) was
controlled by axon imaging workbench 2.2 software
(axon instruments). cells were exposed to excitation
light for 200–400 ms per imaging cycle, repeated at 2min intervals. in each experiment, fura-2 fluorescence
was recorded from 10 to 20 cells within the field of
view, with each individual cell comprising a separate
measuring area (region of interest). changes in intracellular ca2+ concentrations ([ca2+]i) are expressed as the
ratio between fura-2 fluorescence at 340 and 380 nm
(340/380 ratio). all experiments were conducted at room
temperature (23–25 8c).

3. results
3.1.  xxxd444xxx  induces an increase in [ca2+]i in pc12
cells
guided by earlier findings on the ion dependence of
 xxxd444xxx  toxicity in pc12 cells and the significance of
extracellular ca2+ in particular (doroshenko and doroshenko, 2003), we investigated how this drug affected the
intracellular ca2+ levels ([ca2+]i) in pc12 cells. we found
that in cells that were treated for several hours with toxic
concentrations of  xxxd444xxx  (50–100 am), [ca2+]i was
much higher than in control (untreated) cells. preliminary
experiments revealed that this increase in [ca2+]i developed faster at higher concentrations of  xxxd444xxx : 100 am
 xxxd444xxx  caused an elevation of [ca2+]i within ~3 h in
the majority of exposed cells. the averaged time course of
changes in [ca2+]i in all cells within the field of view
indicated that the  xxxd444xxx -induced increase in [ca2+]i
occurred with an ~1 h delay and resulted in a substantial
elevation of [ca2+]i by the end of the recording period, 3 h
(fig. 1a, o). in control (untreated) cells, [ca2+]i was
stable throughout the recording period (fig. 1a, .).
reactions to  xxxd444xxx  of individual cells on the same
coverslip varied widely, both in the amplitude and in the
kinetics of the [ca2+]i increase. some cells had relatively

19

levels both in vitro and in vivo (mizui et al., 1992;
froissard et al., 1997). in the present study, exposure to
 xxxd444xxx  of pc12 cells that were cultured for 24 h in the
presence of 200 am bso resulted in a much earlier
occurrence of the [ca2+]i increase than in cells that were
not treated with bso (fig. 2a and b). to make a
quantitative assessment of this effect, we compared the
half-rise times of the  xxxd444xxx -induced [ca2+]i increases
(as shown in fig. 2a) in control (no bso treatment) and
bso-treated cells. in the controls, the mean half-time of
the  xxxd444xxx -induced [ca2+]i increase was 97f2 min
(n=80 in six experiments, range 57 to 145 min). in the
bso-treated cells, the half-time was significantly smaller
( pb0.0001), only 54f6 min (n=30 in three experiments).
next, we examined the effect of the redox state of the cell
on the  xxxd444xxx -induced [ca2+]i increase by applying the
antioxidant,  xxxd1824xxx . in pc12 cells treated with 50
am  xxxd1824xxx  for 30 min before and during exposure to
 xxxd444xxx , the  xxxd444xxx -induced [ca 2+ ] i increases
occurred significantly later (fig. 2c,d), with the mean
half-rise time of 137f6 min ( pb0.0001, n=31 in three
experiments).

small increases in [ca2+]i (e.g., traces 1 and 2 in fig. 1b).
others had an increase in [ca2+]i that reached an elevated
plateau after a slow buildup (e.g., traces 3 and 4 in fig.
1b). in such cells, a second step-like increase in [ca2+]i
often occurred after an additional delay. there was no
further increase in [ca2+]i beyond this second plateau;
rather, these cells began to lose fura-2 fluorescence, likely
due to a leak. it appears that the variations in the
 xxxd444xxx -induced changes in [ca2+]i in individual cells
reflect various degrees of cellular impairment, and it is
therefore likely that given sufficient time, [ca2+]i in all
exposed cells would have increased substantially.
3.2.  xxxd444xxx -induced increase in [ca2+]i is mediated by
gsh depletion and is redox-sensitive
 xxxd444xxx  has been shown to inhibit glutathione
reductase, an enzyme that recycles reduced gsh from its
oxidized form,  xxxd2811xxx  (frischer and ahmad, 1977), and
therefore is expected to lower the intracellular levels of
gsh (e.g., smith and boyd, 1984). to test whether the
 xxxd444xxx -induced increase in [ca2+]i is indeed mediated
by the gsh depletion, we investigated the effects of
 xxxd396xxx  (bso), which also depletes cellular
gsh but does so by inhibiting  xxxd1388xxx  synthetase (griffith, 1982), the key enzyme in the gsh synthesis
pathway. bso has been used frequently to decrease gsh

3.3. the role of extracellular ca2+ in  xxxd444xxx -induced
[ca2+]i increase
an increase in [ca2+]i can be brought about by several
mechanisms, such as an influx of extracellular ca2+ through
ca2+-permeable ion channels, a decrease in the extrusion of
intracellular ca2+ and a release of ca2+ from intracellular
stores. in the absence of extracellular ca2+, both when only
ca2+ (fig. 3a) or all extracellular inorganic cations
including ca2+ (fig. 3b) were replaced by membraneimpermeable n-methyl-d-glucamine (nmdg), there was
no increase in [ca2+]i during exposure of pc12 cells to
 xxxd444xxx . this observation indicates the essential role of
ca2+ entering the cells from extracellular solution. moreover, when extracellular ca2+ was withdrawn during the
rising phase of the  xxxd444xxx -induced [ca2+]i increase, in
the next few minutes the [ca2+]i declined almost to its
initial level (fig. 3c). reintroduction of extracellular
ca2+, after about 30 min of cell exposure to ca2+-free
solution, resulted in an equally fast recovery of [ca2+]i
(fig. 3c).
the presence of extracellular ca2+, however, does not
seem to be required for the  xxxd444xxx -induced changes in
ca2+ permeability of the cell membrane. this is suggested
by the observation that the [ca2+]i level at the time of
reintroduction of extracellular ca2+ was higher than at the
time of its removal 30 min earlier (fig. 3c). furthermore,
when pc12 cells were first exposed to  xxxd444xxx  in the
ca2+-free solution for a prolonged period of time before
being transferred into a ca2+-containing solution (fig. 3d),
[ca2+]i began to increase almost immediately. however,
without preexposure to  xxxd444xxx , such a transfer of cells
from the ca2+-free into the ca2+-containing extracellular

solution caused only a small and stable increase in [ca2+]i
(e.g., see fig. 4c).
3.4. elucidation of the  xxxd444xxx -induced ca2+ influx
pathways
several ca2+-permeable ion channels have been implicated in oxidative stress-induced ca2+ influx in various
types of cells, including pc12 cells. such channels include:
(1) voltage-gated na+ channels (wang and joseph, 2000);
(2) nonselective cation channels (herson et al., 1999); and
(3) voltage-gated ca2+ channels (jurma et al., 1997; wang
and joseph, 2000). it is unlikely that the na+ channels are
involved in the  xxxd444xxx -induced [ca2+]i increase because
tetrodotoxin (1 am) had no effect (not shown). the role of
nonselective cation channels is more difficult to address
because of the lack of specific blockers for these channels.
 xxxd2122xxx  (200 am), which has been reported to block
oxidative stress-induced nonselective cation channels
(meyer et al., 1996; mukherjee et al., 2002), did not prevent
a rise in [ca2+]i in the presence of  xxxd444xxx  (not shown).
by contrast, dihydropyridine blockers of l-type voltageactivated ca2+ channels effectively suppressed the  xxxd444xxx -induced [ca2+]i increase: both  xxxd2737xxx  (10 am, fig.
4a) and  xxxd2728xxx  (10 am, not shown), when applied
simultaneously with  xxxd444xxx , completely prevented an
increase in [ca2+]i. when the  xxxd444xxx -induced [ca2+]i

21

increase was already in progress, however, the dihydropyridines prevented only a further increase in [ca2+]i (fig. 4b);
in no case did these blockers reverse the [ca2+]i rise to the
extent that was observed after the removal of extracellular
ca2+ (e.g., fig. 3c). it is likely that this difference between
the effects of dihydropyridine blockers and removal of
extracellular ca2+ is indicative of the involvement of an
additional ca2+ permeability that is insensitive to the
dihydropyridines. a possible candidate for such ca2+
permeability is the basal ca2+ permeability described
recently in pc12 cells (bennett et al., 1998). its presence
was revealed by the increase in [ca2+]i that occurred when
control cells were transferred from the ca2+-free solution
into the solution with 5 mm ca2+ (fig. 4c). in the presence
of 5 mm extracellular ca2+, [ca2+]i was stabilized at an
elevated level, which was maintained while the cells were
exposed to extracellular ca2+. the increase in [ca2+]i could
be reversed by the withdrawal of extracellular ca2+ but not
by the addition of gd3+ (10 am),  xxxd2122xxx  (200 am)
or  xxxd2728xxx  (10 am; fig. 4d).
3.5. the role of cl in supporting the  xxxd444xxx -induced
ca2+ influx
we showed previously (doroshenko and doroshenko,
2003) that the removal of extracellular cl or the addition of
cl channel blockers effectively protected pc12 cells from

the 5-ca solution. the cells were not exposed to  xxxd444xxx  at any time.

death that normally follows the exposure of these cells to
 xxxd444xxx . in the present study, the replacement of
extracellular cl with membrane-impermeable gluconate
completely prevented the  xxxd444xxx -induced increase in
[ca2+]i (fig. 5a). to compensate for the effect of chelation
of extracellular ca2+ by gluconate, the ca2+ content of the
cl -free solution in these experiments was increased to 7.5
mm (the calculated free ca2+ concentration was 2.1 mm).
under normal ionic conditions and with 5 mm ca2+ present
in the extracellular solution, several cl channel blockers,
iaa-94 (100 am, fig. 5b) or  xxxg1585xxx  (100 am, not shown),
suppressed the  xxxd444xxx -induced increase in [ca2+]i when
added simultaneously with or prior to  xxxd444xxx . when
added during the rising phase of the  xxxd444xxx -induced
[ca2+]i increase, the aforementioned cl channel blockers

application of the blockers (fig. 5c).

4. discussion
the results of the present study show that exposure of
pc12 cells to  xxxd444xxx  resulted in an increase in the
intracellular ca2+ levels. this finding is consistent with the
pronounced ca2+ dependence of  xxxd444xxx  toxicity in
pc12 cells (doroshenko and doroshenko, 2003). we
assume that the  xxxd444xxx -induced [ca2+]i increase was
caused by depletion of cellular gsh due to the inhibition
by  xxxd444xxx  of  xxxg981xxx  (frischer and
ahmad, 1977; smith and boyd, 1984). the recovery of
reduced gsh from oxidized  xxxd2811xxx  by  xxxg981xxx  and de novo gsh synthesis, whose rate is determined
by an enzyme  xxxd1388xxx  synthetase, is the foremost contributor to cellular pool of gsh (anderson,
1998). accordingly, when  xxxd1388xxx  synthetase
was inhibited by  xxxd396xxx  (bso), the
 xxxd444xxx -induced [ca2+]i increase occurred significantly
earlier than in control cells, apparently due to lower gsh
levels in bso-treated cells.
the link between cellular gsh and the [ca2+]i remains
elusive, although available evidence suggests that it is
mediated by changes in cellular redox status. gsh is a
potent scavenger of reactive oxygen species and its deficiency is bound to result in the rise in their levels, thereby
promoting oxidative stress. an increase in [ca2+]i has long
been recognized to be a major mediator of oxidative cell death
(beal, 1995; orrenius et al., 1996; orrenius and nicotera,
1994). indeed, increased levels of reactive oxygen species
and intracellular ca2+ have both been found to correlate with
decreased gsh levels in pc12 cells with suppressed gsh
synthesis (jurma et al., 1997). consistent with the hypothesis
that oxidative stress is involved in the  xxxd444xxx -induced
[ca2+]i increase is the observation in the present study that the
 xxxd444xxx  effect was delayed in cells treated with an iron
chelator,  xxxd1824xxx . iron is an extremely strong oxidizing
agent that can stimulate the production of highly reactive
hydroxyl radicals via the iron-catalyzed fenton reaction and
haber–weiss cycle (burkitt and gilbert, 1990). the effect of
 xxxd1824xxx  may indicate that endogenous iron is required
for the toxic effects of  xxxd444xxx .
the  xxxd444xxx -induced increase in [ca2+]i appears to be
mainly due to an influx of extracellular ca2+ ions because it
could be completely and reversibly suppressed by the
removal of extracellular ca2+. also, there was no evidence
of ca2+ release from intracellular stores when  xxxd444xxx 
was applied to pc12 cells bathed in the ca 2+-free
extracellular solution. however, the available data do not
exclude its contribution, particularly of the ca2+-induced
ca2+ release, to the subsequent phase(s) of the carmustineinduced increase in [ca2+]i, e.g., during the secondary
increase in [ca2+]i observed in some cells.

n. doroshenko, p. doroshenko / european journal of pharmacology 497 (2004) 17–24

there are several candidate pathways that can mediate
the ca2+ influx. first, the voltage-gated ca2+ channels,
whose presence in pc12 cells and contribution to cytotoxic
effects of certain agents are well documented (e.g.,
kongsamut and miller, 1986; janigro et al., 1989; kim et
al., 2000). in addition, pc12 cells possess a measurable
basal ca2+ permeability (bennett et al., 1998), which is
responsible for the increase in resting [ca2+]i in untreated
cells observed in the present study upon the addition of 5
mm ca2+ to the ca2+-free extracellular solution. also,
distinct redox-sensitive ca2+-permeable ion channels (e.g.,
herson et al., 1999; mukherjee et al., 2002) induced by
gsh depletion/oxidative stress can be involved.
the pharmacological experiments in the present study
suggest a role for l-type ca2+ channels in mediating the
 xxxd444xxx -induced increase in [ca2+]i. thus, dihydropyridine blockers of l-type ca2+ channels,  xxxd2728xxx  and
 xxxd2737xxx , prevented the  xxxd444xxx  effects on [ca2+]i.
these channels have earlier been implicated in [ca2+]i
increase in pc12 cells in which gsh has been depleted by
treatment with the  xxxd1388xxx  synthetase antisense
oligomers (jurma et al., 1997). although the ca2+ channel
blockers were able to inhibit the  xxxd444xxx -induced
increase in [ca2+]i completely when present during the
initial period of exposure to  xxxd444xxx , their inhibitory
effects were only partial when they were applied with a
delay, after the initial rise in [ca2+]i had occurred. it is likely
that this limited ability of the dihydropyridines at saturating
concentrations to reverse the  xxxd444xxx -induced [ca2+]i
increase reveals the involvement of an additional, pharmacologically distinct ca2+ conductance. it is plausible that the
conductance in question is the basal ca2+ conductance,
mentioned above. in untreated cells, the influx of ca2+
mediated by this conductance apparently is small, such that
the cellular ca2+ regulatory system is able to maintain a
stable [ca2+]i. however, if  xxxd444xxx  suppresses ca2+
regulation or enhances the basal ca2+ permeability, the
continuous ca2+ influx associated with the basal ca2+
permeability could result in an increased [ca2+]i in  xxxd444xxx -treated cells. our experimental observations do not
support either of these mechanisms as a principal cause of
the  xxxd444xxx -induced [ca2+]i increase. first, the rapid
recovery of [ca2+]i observed in  xxxd444xxx -treated cells
following withdrawal of extracellular ca2+ indicated that the
ca2+ regulatory system remained functional in the presence
of  xxxd444xxx . second, the basal ca2+ conductance was not
affected by any of the ion channel blockers that were tested
in the present study, including those (e.g.,  xxxd2728xxx ) that
inhibited the  xxxd444xxx -induced increase in [ca2+]i. however, because it has been reported to be ca2+-dependent
(bennett et al., 1998), it could be enhanced in carmustineexposed cells consequent to an early increase in [ca2+]i
caused by the ca2+ channel-mediated ca2+ influx. the
failure of  xxxd2122xxx , a reported blocker of redoxsensitive ca2+-permeable ion channels (herson et al., 1999;
mukherjee et al., 2002), to suppress the  xxxd444xxx  effects

23

in pc12 cells argues against a significant role for these
channels. as a minimum model, the combined involvement
of the l-type ca2+ channels and the basal ca2+ conductance
appears to suffice the experimental observations of the
present study.
the mechanisms of engagement of ca2+ channels by
 xxxd444xxx  are not clear. on the one hand, the anticipated
increase in reactive oxygen species in  xxxd444xxx -treated
cells could cause up-regulation of the activity of l-type
ca2+ channels, as was described recently in pc12 cells
(green et al., 2002). however, a depolarizing shift of the
membrane potential would also be required to open the ca2+
channels. in pc12 cells treated with the  xxxd1388xxx 
synthetase antisense oligomers (jurma et al., 1997), the
required membrane depolarization apparently resulted from
the inhibition of na+/k+ atpase activity and subsequent
activation of voltage-gated na+ channels. in the present
study, the  xxxd444xxx -induced [ca2+]i increase was not
affected by tetrodotoxin, an inhibitor of the na+ channels,
but was completely inhibited by several different cl
channel blockers or by the removal of extracellular cl .
furthermore, delayed applications of cl channel blockers
resulted in stabilizing [ca2+]i at the levels attained by the
time of applications and preventing its further rise, as did the
ca2+ channel blockers. these observations suggest that the
required changes in the membrane potential were brought
about by transmembrane cl fluxes. the specific mechanisms of cl channel involvement remain unidentified at
present.
taken together, the data obtained in this and an earlier
study (doroshenko and doroshenko, 2003) strongly support
the hypothesis that the  xxxd444xxx -induced death of pc12
cells is mediated by a ca2+ overload that is caused by a
 xxxd444xxx -induced influx of extracellular ca2+. the causative link between the  xxxd444xxx -induced [ca2+]i increase
and cell death is substantiated by the similarity of the time
course of these events and by the finding that each of the
experimental treatments that suppressed the carmustineinduced [ca2+]i increase also protected pc12 cells against
 xxxd444xxx -induced death. the underlying event supposedly
is the inhibition by  xxxd444xxx  of  xxxg981xxx  that
results in the depletion of cellular gsh and, consequently,
in increased levels of reactive oxygen species.
