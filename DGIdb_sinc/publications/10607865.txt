abstract
the mechanism of 3,4- xxxd2611xxx  žmdma.-induced depletion of brain serotonin ž5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht.
has been proposed to involve the generation of reactive oxygen species. in the present study, quantification of the extracellular
concentration of  xxxd30xxx  ž2,3- xxxd30xxx . from  xxxd3159xxx  was used as an index of hydroxyl radical generation.
although both mdma and d-amphetamine markedly increased the extracellular concentration of dopamine in the striatum, only mdma
increased the extracellular concentration of 2,3- xxxd30xxx . treatment with fluoxetine either 1 h prior to or 4 h following the administration
of mdma reduced the mdma-induced formation of 2,3- xxxd30xxx  and also attenuated the mdma-induced depletion of 5-ht in the
striatum. these results are supportive of the view that the mdma-induced generation of hydroxyl radicals and, ultimately, the long-term
depletion of 5-ht, is dependent, in part, on the activation of the 5-ht transporter. q 1999 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
3,4- xxxd2611xxx  žmdma. is considered to be potentially toxic to the serotonergic nerve
terminals of experimental animals žgreen et al., 1995;
sprague et al., 1998. and possibly humans žbolla et al.,
1998.. mdma produces biochemical and immunocytochemical effects such as a long-term depletion of brain
serotonin ž5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht. and its major
metabolite 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid žstone et al., 1986;
schmidt, 1987., a decrease in tryptophan hydroxylase activity žschmidt and taylor, 1987; stone et al., 1987., a
reduction in w3 hxparoxetine-labelled 5-ht uptake sites
žbattaglia et al., 1987. and reduced immunostaining of
5-ht terminals žo’hearn et al., 1988; scallet et al., 1988..
although the mechanism of mdma-induced 5-ht toxicity has not yet been completely elucidated, there is
evidence that psychostimulant-induced neurotoxicity is associated with the induction of oxidative stress. gibb et al.

ž1990. suggested that mdma promotes oxidative stress
within 5-ht neurons on the basis of the observation that
the mdma-induced inactivation of tryptophan hydroxylase was reversed by sulfhydryl reducing conditions žstone
et al., 1988a.. the promotion of a state of oxidative stress
in 5-ht neurons by amphetamine analogues has been
inferred from studies in which the administration of antioxidants or spin trap agents has been shown to prevent the
5-ht depletion produced by these psychostimulants

schmidt and kehne, 1990; colado and green, 1995;
gudelsky, 1996.. in addition, cadet et al. ž1995. reported
that transgenic mice that over-express the cuzn-superoxide dismutase gene are resistant to the neurotoxic effects
of mdma.
in further support of the view that the mechanism of
mdma-toxicity to 5-ht terminals involves oxidative stress
is the fact that mdma increases the formation of hydroxyl
radicals, as evidenced by an increased conversion of  xxxd3159xxx  to  xxxd30xxx  ž2,3- xxxd30xxx .

duced 5-ht neurotoxicity žcolado et al., 1999a,b; shankaran et al., 1999..
factors that contribute to mdma-induced hydroxyl
radical formation and, ultimately, 5-ht neurotoxicity appear to include hyperthermia and dopamine. drugs that
diminish mdma-induced hyperthermia also diminish the
mdma-induced generation of hydroxyl radicals and 5-ht
neurotoxicity žcolado et al., 1999a,b.. in addition,  xxxd2546xxx , a dopamine uptake inhibitor, attenuates the mdmainduced increase in the extracellular concentration of
dopamine, as well as the mdma-induced generation of
hydroxyl radicals and long-term depletion of striatal 5-ht
žshankaran et al., 1999..
there also is evidence that favors a role of the 5-ht
transporter in the mdma-induced depletion of brain 5-ht.
the basis for this hypothesis is the finding that fluoxetine,
a 5-ht transport inhibitor, attenuates mdma-induced
5-ht neurotoxicity žschmidt, 1987; malberg et al., 1996;
aguirre et al., 1998.. the finding that mdma-induced
hydroxyl radical formation is absent in rats in which 5-ht
terminals have been depleted by fenfluramine žcolado et
al., 1997. is additional support for the importance of the
5-ht terminal itself in the mechanism of mdma-induced
neurotoxicity.
in the present study, we sought to examine the role of
the 5-ht transporter in the mdma-induced generation of
hydroxyl radicals and subsequent long-term depletion of
striatal 5-ht with the use of fluoxetine.

2. materials and methods
2.1. animal procedures
adult male rats ž200–275 g. of the sprague–dawley
strain žcharles river, portage, mi. were used in the studies. the animals were housed three per cage in a temperature and light controlled room žlights on 0600–1800 h.
until the day of surgery. all procedures were in strict
adherence to the national institutes of health guidelines
and approved by the institutional animal care committee.
2.2. in õiõo microdialysis procedures
the formation of hydroxyl radicals was determined by
quantifying the formation of  xxxd30xxx 
ž2,3- xxxd30xxx . from  xxxd3159xxx  žfloyd et al., 1984.. for
the experiments in which  xxxd3159xxx  was perfused
through the microdialysis probe, the rats were anesthetized
with chloral hydrate ž400 mgrkg, i.v.., and a microdialysis
probe was implanted into the striatum ž1.2 mm a, 3.1 mm
l from bregma. according to the stereotaxic atlas of
paxinos and watson ž1986.. the tip of the probe was 7
mm below the surface of the brain, and the probe was
secured to the skull with screws and cranioplastic cement.

the rats were allowed to recover, and the microdialysis
experiment was performed the following day.
concentric style microdialysis probes were constructed
as described previously žyamamoto and pehek, 1990. with
some modifications. the probes were constructed entirely
from polyethylene and teflon tubing, in order to eliminate
metal components, which promote the non-specific formation of hydroxyl radicals. the dialysis surface of the
membrane žspectra por, 6000 mw cutoff, 210 mm outside
diameter. for the striatum was 4.5 mm in length. the in
vitro recoveries of the dialysis probes were 10–15% for
dopamine and 2,3- xxxd30xxx , and no correction was made for
recoveries.
on the day of the experiment, the probe was connected
to an infusion pump set to deliver dulbecco’s phosphate
buffered saline containing 1.2 mm  xxxg2125xxx  2 and 10 mm
glucose at a rate of 1.8 ulrmin. following an equilibration
period of 1.5 h, buffer including 5mm  xxxd3159xxx  was
perfused through the probe for the duration of the experiment. at least three baseline samples were obtained at
30-min intervals after which drug was administered, and
samples were obtained thereafter at 1-h intervals.
2.3. biochemical measurements
the extracellular concentration of 2,3- xxxd30xxx  was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography žhplc.
with electrochemical detection. aliquots ž20 ul. of the
dialysis samples were injected onto a c18 column ž3 mm,
100 = 3 mm. connected to an electrochemical detector
with a glassy carbon electrode maintained at 0.55 v relative to a agragcl reference electrode. the mobile phase
was similar to that described by althaus et al. ž1995. and
fleckenstein et al. ž1997., and was composed of 14.15 grl
monochloroacetic  xxxd2351xxx % žvol.rvol.. acetonitrile, 7%
žvol.rvol.. tetrahydrofuran, ph 2.4, pumped at a flow rate
of 0.4 mlrmin. peak heights following injection of 20 ml
samples were recorded with an integrator, and 2,3- xxxd30xxx 
content was calculated based on known standards. the
retention time for 2,3- xxxd30xxx  was approximately 9 min.
dopamine in dialysis samples and 5-ht in striatal
tissue were quantified with hplc with electrochemical
detection using methods similar to those described elsewhere žgudelsky et al., 1994.. briefly, samples were injected onto a c18-column ž5 mm, 100 = 2mm. connected
to a lc-4b amperometric detector žbioanalytical systems,
west laffayette, in.. the mobile phase consisted of 35
mm  xxxd1710xxx , 54 mm sodium acetate, 50 mgrl of
disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate, 40 mgrl of octanesulfonic acid sodium salt, 4% žvol.rvol.. methanol, ph
4.0, pumped at a flow rate of 0.4 mlrmin. peak heights
following injection of 20 ml samples were recorded with
an integrator, and the quantities of dopamine and 5-ht
were calculated on the basis of known standards.
for postmortem analysis of brain 5-ht, the rats were
killed by decapitation 7 days after the administration of

m. shankaran et al.r european journal of pharmacology 385 (1999) 103–110

mdma. the tissues were kept frozen žy808c. until analyzed for 5-ht. the tissue samples were homogenized
with 0.2 n perchloric acid and centrifuged for 6 min at
10,000 = g, and an aliquot of the resulting supernatant
fluid was analyzed for 5-ht. the retention times for
dopamine and 5-ht were approximately 6 and 18 min,
respectively.
2.4. in õitro formation of hydroxyl radicals
assessment of the in vitro formation of hydroxyl radicals was accomplished using a simple fe 2qrascorbate
system based on the fenton reaction and measuring the
formation of 2,3- xxxd30xxx  in the presence of  xxxd3159xxx .
žste-marie et al., 1996.. the incubation mixture contained
the following at final concentrations: 260 ml dulbecco’s
phosphate buffer, 50 ml ferrous sulfate ž1 mm., 170 ul
 xxxd228xxx  ž100 mm., 20 ml disodium ethylenediamine
tetraacetate ž1 mm., 250 ml  xxxd3159xxx  ž1 mm., and 250
ml fluoxetine ž0.1, 1, 3 or10 mm.. in the blank solution,
fluoxetine was replaced with water ž250 ml.. the amount
of 2,3- xxxd30xxx  formed was measured at 0, 20, 40 and 60
min by the hplc method described above.

the racemic mixture of mdma hydrochloride was
provided by the national institute on drug abuse. mdma
was dissolved in 0.15 m nacl and injected s.c. in a

2.6. statistical analysis
analysis of the tissue concentrations of 5-ht was performed using a one-way analysis of variance, and differences between treatment groups were assessed with the
student–newman–keuls test. data from dialysis experiments were analyzed using a two-way repeated measures
analysis of variance žsigmastat, jandel scientific.. multiple pairwise comparisons were performed using the student–newman–keuls test. the rate of formation of 2,3dhba in vitro was assessed by linear regression analysis,
and the comparison of slopes was done by one-way analysis of variance. treatment differences were considered
statistically significant at p - 0.05.

in order to obviate the concern that a diminished

4. discussion
although the exact mechanism of mdma-induced 5-ht
toxicity is unknown, there is increasing evidence in support of the hypothesis that oxidative stress due to the
formation of free radicals may be involved in mdma-induced damage to 5-ht terminals. the findings that free
radical scavengers and antioxidants attenuate the mdmainduced depletion of 5-ht žschmidt and kehne, 1990;
colado and green, 1995; gudelsky, 1996. provide indirect
evidence for the involvement of free radicals in the mechanism of mdma neurotoxicity. in addition, mdma has
been reported to produce cellular changes, e.g., lipid peroxidation, protein nitration, consistent with the formation
of free radicals žsprague and nichols, 1995; colado et al.,
1997; yamamoto and gudelsky, unpublished observations..
finally, green and co-workers, as well as gudelsky and
colleagues, have demonstrated that mdma increases the
formation of hydroxyl radicals, as evidenced by an increased extracellular concentration of 2,3- xxxd30xxx  following
 xxxd3159xxx  administration žcolado et al., 1997 1999a,b;
gudelsky and yamamoto, 1994; shankaran et al., 1999..

107

the stimulatory effect of mdma on the formation of
 xxxd30xxx  reported in the present study is
consistent with these previous reports.
the activation of the 5-ht transporter by mdma
appears to exert a critical role in the long-term toxicity to
5-ht terminals. in accord with previous studies žschmidt,
1987; malberg et al., 1996; aguirre et al., 1998., treatment
of rats with fluoxetine provided protection against the
mdma-induced depletion of 5-ht in the striatum. it is
additionally noteworthy that the administration of fluoxetine 4 h following the administration of mdma afforded
neuroprotection against mdma-induced 5-ht toxicity.
schmidt ž1987. also has reported that treatment of rats
with fluoxetine up to 6 h after an injection of mdma
significantly attenuates mdma-induced 5-ht neurotoxicity.
the administration of fluoxetine either prior to or following the administration of mdma resulted in a reduction of the mdma-induced formation of hydroxyl radicals. it is unlikely that fluoxetine directly scavenges hydroxyl radicals, inasmuch as the in vitro generation of
hydroxyl radicals was not affected by fluoxetine in the
present study at concentrations that are normally attained
in the brain žcaccia et al., 1992; gardier et al., 1993;
malagie et al., 1996.. it also is unlikely that fluoxetine
prevents the mdma-induced formation of hydroxyl radicals through an attenuation of mdma-induced hyperthermia. although pharmacological agents that suppress
mdma-induced hyperthermia attenuate hydroxyl radical
formation žcolado et al., 1999a,b., fluoxetine has been
shown not to diminish the hyperthermic response to
mdma žmalberg et al., 1996; aguirre et al., 1998..
one potential mechanism by which fluoxetine attenuates the mdma-induced formation of hydroxyl radicals is
by preventing the entry into the 5-ht terminal of reactive
substances that are capable of generating free radicals. the
importance of the 5-ht terminal itself for the generation
of hydroxyl radicals is underscored by the finding that
mdma-induced hydroxyl radical formation is absent in
rats in which 5-ht terminals have been disrupted by
fenfluramine žcolado et al., 1997.. potential sources of
hydroxyl radicals within the 5-ht terminal include the
oxidation of dopamine or mdma itself žgraham, 1978;
schmidt and lovenberg, 1985; cohen, 1987; hiramatsu et
al., 1990; faraj et al., 1994; colado et al., 1995..
it can be envisioned that excessive extracellular
dopamine may give rise to the formation of reactive
oxygen species žc.f., cadet and brannock, 1998., and the
mdma-induced increase in hydroxyl radical formation
may simply be a consequence of the increase in the
extracellular concentration of dopamine. however, in the
present study, unlike mdma, d-amphetamine, which also
produced an immediate and large increase in the extracellular concentration of dopamine, did not enhance the formation of hydroxyl radicals. huang et al. ž1997. also have
reported that the administration of amphetamine alone

108

m. shankaran et al.r european journal of pharmacology 385 (1999) 103–110

does not increase hydroxyl radical formation. these results
are suggestive that the generation of hydroxyl radicals is
not simply the result of an increase in the extracellular
concentration of dopamine.
nevertheless, there is recent evidence for a role of
dopamine in the mdma-induced generation of hydroxyl
radicals, as well as the long-term depletion of striatal 5-ht
žstone et al., 1988b; brodkin et al., 1993, shankaran et al.,
1999.. on the basis of the present results, it is tempting to
suggest that dopamine is necessary, but not sufficient, to
allow for the mdma-induced generation of hydroxyl radicals and 5-ht toxicity. this view is supported by the
finding that the combined administration of amphetamine
with the non-neurotoxic mdma analog, 5-methoxy-6methyl-2-aminoindan, which produces carrier-mediated
5-ht release, results in 5-ht neurotoxicity, although neither of these drugs produces damage to 5-ht terminals
when administered alone žjohnson and nichols, 1991..
these findings further strengthen the view that activation
of the 5-ht transporter by mdma is essential for producing damage to 5-ht terminals. sprague et al. ž1998. have
speculated that dopamine released by mdma may enter
the 5-ht terminal through an activated 5-ht transporter
and be oxidized by  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx -b enzyme present
within the 5-ht terminal leading to the generation of free
radicals.
however, it is difficult to reconcile the postulated role
of dopamine in mdma-induced hydroxyl radical formation and 5-ht toxicity in brain regions, e.g., hippocampus,
which receive sparse dopaminergic innervation. indeed,
the role of dopamine in mdma-induced 5-ht toxicity in
the hippocampus žshankaran and gudelsky, 1998. and
hydroxyl radical formation in other brain regions žcolado
et al., 1999b. is somewhat controversial. the finding that
hydroxyl radical formation was reduced in mdma-treated
rats given fluoxetine at a time, viz., 4 h after mdma
treatment, when extracellular concentrations of dopamine
had returned to baseline values also appears to be inconsistent with the view that dopamine oxidation is a source of
hydroxyl radicals.
an alternative source of hydroxyl radicals may be
mdma itself. the metabolism of mdma produces catechols and quinones that can result in the further formation
of free radicals žhiramatsu et al., 1990; colado et al.,
1995.. moreover, mdma produces a massive release of
5-ht žgudelsky and nash, 1996. which can be acted upon
by hydroxyl radicals to generate species that may be toxic
to 5-ht terminals žwong et al., 1993; wrona and dryhurst, 1998.. it is noteworthy that the concentration of
mdma in the brain 4 h after its administration is substantial and is approximately the same as that attained 30 min
after its administration žgudelsky, 1996.. the ability of
fluoxetine treatment 4 h after the administration of mdma
to reduce hydroxyl radical formation might be indicative
of a continued action of mdma itself through the 5-ht
transporter to generate hydroxyl radicals.

in summary, the results of the present study lend additional support to the view that mdma increases the
formation of hydroxyl radicals. moreover, beyond the
potential roles of hyperthermia žcolado et al., 1999a,b. and
the  xxxg2149xxx  žshankaran et al., 1999. in the
process of mdma-induced hydroxyl radical formation, the
present results also implicate the 5-ht transporter in the
mechanism of hydroxyl radical formation and 5-ht neurotoxicity produced by mdma. however, the identity of the
species that ultimately gives rise to hydroxyl radical formation remains to be determined. nevertheless, the findings that drugs že.g.,  xxxd2546xxx , fluoxetine, chlormethiazole. that suppress the mdma-induced formation of
hydroxyl radicals also suppress mdma-induced 5-ht
neurotoxicity provide additional support for the view that
the mechanism of mdma-induced neurotoxicity to 5-ht
terminals involves the induction of oxidative stress following the increased formation of hydroxyl radicals.
