abstract
we studied the effects of oral administration of  xxxd3219xxx  on the expression of the pro-inflammatory mediators,  xxxd2738xxx 
synthase (inos) and cyclooxygenase- (cox-) 1 and 2, in rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae).  xxxd3219xxx 
(200 mg/kg) was administered orally for 13 days after the induction of eae by immunization with guinea pig  xxxg1383xxx  and
complete freund’s adjuvant. the onset (p , 0:0001) and severity (p , 0:05) of eae paralysis in salicylate-treated animals were delayed
and suppressed significantly compared with vehicle-treated controls. western blot analysis showed that expression of cox-2 and inos, but
not cox-1, decreased significantly in the spinal cords of salicylate-treated rats compared with vehicle-treated controls (p , 0:05) and this
finding was paralleled by immunohistochemical observations. these results suggest that the amelioration by salicylate of paralysis in rats
with eae is mediated in part by the suppression of cox and inos.

experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae) is a tcell-mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous
system (cns) that is used as an experimental model of
human demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.
the clinical course of eae is characterized by weight loss,
ascending progressive paralysis, and spontaneous recovery.
these stages are paralleled by an inflammatory response in
the cns [13]. during the pathogenesis of eae, many proinflammatory mediators, including inducible  xxxd2738xxx 
synthase (inos), participate in the progression of eae
paralysis [9,12]. in addition to the metabolites of nitric
oxide (no), the  xxxd208xxx  pathway is involved in the
course of eae [16].
cyclooxygenase- (cox-) 1 and 2 are key enzymes
within the metabolism cascade of  xxxd208xxx  and

participate in the generation of prostaglandins, leukotrienes,
and reactive oxygen species [6]. several studies have
suggested that cox inhibitors such as aspirin and the
aspirin metabolite, salicylate, can reduce inflammation in
the cns and ameliorate the effects of eae, spinal cord
injury, and excitotoxic/ischemic brain injury [1,5,10,16,17].
this effect appears to be due to a reduction in cox-1 and/or
cox-2 activity during the immune response [14,18].
aspirin and  xxxd3219xxx  inhibit the induction of
inos mrna in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated raw 264.7
macrophages, but enhance inos mrna expression in cells
that have been stimulated with interferon-gamma. moreover, aspirin inhibits no production and inos protein
expression without affecting inos mrna levels [7]. inos
is an important pro-inflammatory mediator that is involved
in the induction of acute monophasic eae in rat [15]. each
of the aforementioned findings implies that salicylate has

the potential to inhibit various pro-inflammatory mediators
that are involved in autoimmune diseases, but little is known
about the precise mechanism by which salicylate ameliorates eae.
in this study, we confirmed that  xxxd3219xxx  can
ameliorate the clinical symptoms of eae in rat, as described
previously, and examined whether salicylate altered the
expression of inos and cox-1 and -2, in rats with eae.
we used male lewis rats (160 –200 g, 7 –12 weeks old)
that were obtained from harlan (sprague –dawley, indianapolis, in) and bred within our animal facility. each rat
was injected bilaterally in the hind footpads with an
emulsion containing equal parts of guinea pig myelin
basic protein (gpbp) in phosphate buffer (mg/ml) and
complete freund’s adjuvant (cfa; mycobacterium tuberculosis h37ra, 2 mg/ml; difco). immunized rats were
observed daily for clinical signs of eae. the progress of
eae was divided into seven stages, namely grade (g) 0 (no
signs), g1 (floppy tail), g2 (mild paraparesis), g3 (severe
paraparesis), g4 (tetraparesis), g5 (moribund condition or
death), and r0 (recovery). control rats were immunized
with cfa only.
to examine the effects of  xxxd3219xxx  on the
clinical progression of eae,  xxxd3219xxx  (200 mg/kg)
was administered orally for 13 days to rats that had been
immunized with gpbp at day zero. this dose was based on
a preliminary experiment that was carried out to determine
an effective dose.  xxxd3219xxx  was obtained from
sigma (st. louis, mo) and was dissolved in warm distilled
water (w/v). control animals received only the vehicle
(distilled water). immunized rats were observed daily for
clinical signs of eae, which were categorized according to
the aforementioned stages. five rats were killed under ether
anesthesia at different stages of eae (see below).
to study the expression of cox-1, cox-2, and inos in
lesions from rats with eae, cns tissue was sampled on
post-immunization (p.i.) days 14 and 17, respectively. the
spinal cords of rats were removed and frozen (2 70 8c) for
protein analysis. pieces of the spinal cords were embedded
in paraffin wax after fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde in
phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) at ph 7.4.
the frozen spinal cords were thawed at room temperature, minced, homogenized in lysis buffer (40 mm tris –
hcl, 120 mm nacl, 0.1% nonidet p-40 (polyoxyethylene
[7] p-t-octyl phenol), ph 7.4) that contained the protease
inhibitors leupeptin (0.5 mg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride (1 mm), and aprotinin (5 mg/ml). samples were
electrophoresed under denaturing conditions in sodium
 xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gels using a discontinuous
procedure. the proteins were then electrotransferred in
transfer buffer to a nitrocellulose membrane. immunoblotting with goat anti-cox-1 or anti-cox-2 (1:1000 dilution
each, santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca) or rabbit
anti-inos (1:1000 dilution, transduction laboratories,
lexington, ky) antibodies was performed as described
previously [11]. the immunoblot membranes were reprobed

with a monoclonal antibody against beta actin (sigma, st.
louis, mo). the amount of protein in each blot was
quantified using a densitometer (m gs-700 imaging
densitometer, bio-rad, hercules, ca). the relative
expression of inos and cox was calculated from three
different experiments, and the value for the cfa control was
arbitrarily defined as 1 (fig. 1).
paraffin-wax-embedded spinal cords were sectioned (5
mm), cleared, and treated with 0.3%  xxxd2298xxx  in
distilled water for 20 min to block endogenous peroxidase
activity. after three washes in pbs, the sections were
exposed to an appropriate blocking serum and then
incubated with goat anti-cox-1 or anti-cox-2 or rabbit
anti-inos (1:400 dilutions for each) antibodies for 24 h in a
refrigerator. to identify astrocytes and macrophages, rabbit
anti- xxxg883xxx  (sigma) and mouse
monoclonal anti-rat macrophages (ed1) (serotec, london,
uk) were used. after three washes, the appropriate
biotinylated secondary antibody and avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (abc elite, vector labs, burlingame, ca)
were added sequentially. the peroxidase was reacted with a
diaminobenzidine substrate (vector). before being
mounted, the sections were counterstained with
hematoxylin.
data are expressed as mean ^ sd. the progression of
eae was compared between salicylate-treated and vehicletreated control animals using student’s unpaired, two-tailed
t-test. for the western blot study, statistical significance of
protein expression was evaluated using one-way analysis of
variance with the student-newman – keuls post hoc test for
multiple comparisons.
all animals exhibited paralysis as eae developed. the
first onset of eae paralysis in salicylate-treated rats with
eae (15.0 ^ 0.8 days) were significantly delayed compared with vehicle-treated controls (12.2 ^ 0.7 days)

salicylate (sal. tx; lanes 3, 5). the amount of protein in each blot was
quantified using a densitometer. the relative expression of inos and  xxxg1883xxx /-2 was calculated after normalization to beta actin from three different
samples, and the value for the control was arbitrarily defined as 1. lane 1:

(p , 0:0001) (table 1). a significant amelioration of the
clinical severity of eae paralysis from grade 1.4 ^ 0.8 to
grade 2.8 ^ 0.7 was also observed in salicylate-treated
versus vehicle treated eae rats (p , 0:05) (table 1).
the aforementioned delay in the onset of eae in
salicylate-treated rats confirmed previous reports that
salicylate ameliorates the symptoms of eae in rats. this
result was supported by the results of the western blot
analysis. specifically, progression of eae is associated
with a significant up-regulation of inos and cox-1/-2
expression in spinal cords (fig. 1, lane 2, p , 0:05 vs.
cfa control [lane 1]) and slightly declined thereafter
(fig. 1, lane 4).
at day 14 p.i., inos expression was much greater in
the vehicle treated group (fig. 1, lane 2) (optical density
37.4 ^ 2.6) which was in sharp contrast to that of
salicylate treated group (optical density 1.9 ^ 2.1)
(p , 0:05) (fig. 1, lane 2). a significant suppression of
cox-2 from optical density 1.3 ^ 2.4 to 34.5 ^ 2.7, but
not cox-1, was also detected in salicylate treated (fig.
1, lane 3) versus vehicle treated eae rats (fig. 1, lane 2)
(p , 0:05). at the recovery stage of eae (p.i. day 17),
however, there was no significant difference in either
cox or inos expression between salicylate-treated rats
and vehicle-treated controls (fig. 1, lanes 4 and 5).
in the spinal cords of rats with eae at p.i. day 14,
most inos immunoreactivity was located in perivascular
ed1-immunopositive inflammatory cells, as described
previously [9] (fig. 2a). cox-1 was expressed mainly in
ed1-immunopositive perivascular macrophages and reactive microglia (fig. 2c). cox-2 immunoreactivity was
largely confined to endothelial cells (fig. 2e) and was
rarely observed in perivascular ed1-immunopositive
inflammatory cells (data not shown). the expression of
cox in the spinal cords of rats with eae observed in
the present study corresponds well with the pattern of
cox expression in the brain of rats with eae that was
reported previously [3].
the histopathological lesions in salicylate-treated animals and vehicle-treated controls at p.i. day 14 were not
identical (fig. 2). inflammatory cells were less abundant in
the spinal cords of salicylate-treated rats (figs. 2b,d,f)
relative to vehicle-treated controls (figs. 2a,c,e) and the
expression of inos (fig. 2b), cox-1 (fig. 2d), and cox-2

in the spinal cords of rats with eae (p.i. day 14) that were treated either
with vehicle (a, c, e) or  xxxd3219xxx  (b, d, f). in the spinal cords of
vehicle-treated rats, many inflammatory cells were observed in parenchyma

rats, cells were localized mainly to the subarachnoid space (b, d, f).

(fig. 2f) was suppressed in both the parenchyma and
perivascular lesions in salicylate-treated animals.
the aforementioned results confirm that oral administration of  xxxd3219xxx  can ameliorate the paralysis that
is caused by eae in rats by delaying the onset of initial
symptoms and reducing clinical severity. in previous
studies, aspirin and its metabolites were reported to suppress
eae paralysis. weston and johnston [17] suggested that
aspirin inhibited the development of eae by inhibiting
dna synthesis in lymphocytes, which would lead to a
reduction in the proliferation of these cells [4]. en3638, a
derivative of salicylate, delayed the onset of clinical
symptoms in both the ordinary and hyperacute forms of
eae [10]. however, it is not yet certain which mechanisms
are involved in the suppression of eae paralysis by aspirin
and its metabolites. our observation that  xxxd3219xxx 
inhibited the expression of inos and cox in the spinal cord
during the development of eae suggests that proinflammatory molecules might be involved in the ameliorative effects of aspirin and its metabolites.
both inos [12] and cox [3] have been reported to be

involved in the development of eae. in the present study,
histological examination of spinal cords from rats with eae
revealed that inos- and cox-immunopositive cells were
located in perivascular lesions, as reported previously.
furthermore, most ed1-immunopositive (inflammatory)
cells, including macrophages and reactive microglia, coexpressed both inos and cox-1. although cox-2 was
rarely expressed in inflammatory cells, cox-2 immunoreactivity was observed within endothelial cells in perivascular lesions. these observations suggest that inflammatory
cells infiltrate lesions during the progression of eae and
support the notion that inos and cox are important
components of the immune response.
as  xxxd2951xxx  [15,19], an inhibitor of inos, and
bw755c [16], which inhibits both cox and  xxxg147xxx , has been shown to ameliorate eae, it is possible that
salicylate inhibits inos and cox expression during eae.
 xxxd3219xxx  reportedly inhibits inos expression in
lipopolysaccharide-stimulated raw 267.7 murine macrophages [2] and murine brain microglia that were stimulated
with lipopolysaccharide plus  xxxg1141xxx  [8]. in addition,
salicylate inhibits cox-2 expression in human endothelial
cells in umbilical veins and foreskin fibroblasts [18]. in a
recent in vivo study, rats that were treated with fluorinated
salicylate had reduced inos and cox-2 expression
following excitotoxic/ischemic brain injury [1]. in the
present study, western blot analysis showed that inos
and cox expression was reduced in the spinal cords of
salicylate-treated rats with eae as compared to vehicletreated rats with eae. this result was paralleled by our
immunohistochemical findings and suggests that the
suppression of the clinical symptoms of eae in rats that
were treated with salicylate might be due to inhibition of
inos and cox.
in conclusion, we suggest that salicylate ameliorates the
paralysis that characterizes the progression of eae by
suppressing cox and inos expression in the spinal cord.
