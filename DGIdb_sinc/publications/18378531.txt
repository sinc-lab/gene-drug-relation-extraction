abstract
tumor resistance to chemotherapeutic agents ultimately
leads to treatment failure in the majority of cancer patients.
the identification of new agents that are less susceptible to
mechanisms of tumor resistance could, therefore, bring significant clinical benefits to patients with advanced cancer.
one new drug class of great interest in this respect is the
epothilones and their analogues, which are microtubule inhibitors with low susceptibility to several mechanisms of drug
resistance.
 xxxd2410xxx  is an analogue of natural  xxxd2854xxx  with
activity against a wide range of tumor types, including
drug-resistant tumors. this is consistent with the preclinical activity of  xxxd2410xxx  against human cancer cell lines

resistant to taxanes and other agents. taxane resistance in
these cells may be acquired or primary and results from
several mechanisms, such as overexpression of multidrugresistance proteins and the ␤iii-tubulin isoform.
 xxxd2410xxx  has demonstrated efficacy as monotherapy or
in combination with  xxxd425xxx  in anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated/resistant metastatic breast cancer (mbc),
and has recently been approved for use in resistant/refractory mbc. other epothilones, such as  xxxd2854xxx , kos-1584,
and zk-epo, are also being evaluated in drug-resistant cancers.  xxxd2410xxx  represents a new treatment option for mbc
patients with cancers resistant to available chemotherapeutic
agents. the oncologist 2008;13:214 –221

introduction

a common therapeutic target with other mtis, the epothilones have a distinct mode of binding to tubulin that may
reduce cross-resistance. significantly, epothilones display lower susceptibility to several key mechanisms of
drug resistance, such as elevated expression of mdr,
overexpression of ␤iii-tubulin, and ␤-tubulin mutations
[12–14], making them interesting candidates for evaluation in the clinic, especially in diseases where anthracyclines and taxanes are heavily used.
since the initial identification of natural epothilones
as antineoplastic agents, chemical modification has allowed the generation of synthetic and semisynthetic analogues with superior metabolic and pharmacokinetic
properties in the clinical setting.  xxxd2410xxx  (bms247550, aza- xxxd2854xxx ), a semisynthetic analogue of
 xxxd2854xxx , has a lactone–lactam modification that
minimizes susceptibility to esterase degradation [15].
 xxxd2410xxx  has been shown to have clinical activity
against multiple tumor types, including those resistant to
common chemotherapeutic agents, and is effective in
metastatic breast cancer (mbc) as monotherapy or in
combination with  xxxd425xxx . this review briefly summarizes these clinical data and focuses on the preclinical
characteristics of  xxxd2410xxx  that allow it to overcome
both primary and acquired tumor resistance.

clinical activity of  xxxd2410xxx 
 xxxd2410xxx  has demonstrated single-agent activity against
a wide variety of solid tumors, including breast cancer (earlyand late-stage disease) [16, 17], nsclc [18], pancreatic
cancer [19], renal cell cancer (rcc) [20], prostate cancer
[21], and lymphoma [22]. the majority of these studies involved tumors that were heavily pretreated. the largest
phase ii trial with  xxxd2410xxx  monotherapy was conducted
in anthracycline-, taxane-, and  xxxd425xxx -resistant mbc
patients [23]. in this population,  xxxd2410xxx  (administered
at a dose of 40 mg/m2 as a 3-hour i.v. infusion every 3
weeks) produced an overall response rate (orr) of 12%
and a median progression-free survival (pfs) time of 3.1
months [23].  xxxd2410xxx  also showed activity in another
phase ii trial in taxane-resistant mbc patients, with a response rate of 12% [24]. a phase ii trial evaluated  xxxd2410xxx  (administered at a dose of 32 mg/m2 as a 3-hour i.v.
infusion every 3 weeks or at a dose of 6 mg/m2 as a 1-hour
i.v. infusion for five consecutive days every 3 weeks) in
nsclc patients who had failed a first-line platinum-based
chemotherapy regimen [18]. orrs of 14.3% (32 mg/m2
dose) and 11.6% (6 mg/m2 daily ⫻ 5 dose) were reported
[18].

resistance to chemotherapeutics remains one of the most
significant stumbling blocks to achieving long-term remissions in cancer therapy. while the currently available chemotherapy agents certainly induce clinical responses,
cancers ultimately progress in the vast majority of cases after a period of ongoing response [1]. multidrug resistance
(mdr) to a particular agent is defined as resistance not only
to other agents of the same drug class, but also to agents
from structurally unrelated classes. this is often a result of
overexpression of efflux pump proteins such as p-glycoprotein (p-gp; encoded by  xxxg10xxx ) and multidrug resistance–
associated protein (mrp) [1]. these efflux pumps limit the
effectiveness of agents such as anthracyclines and taxanes
by transporting them out of their site of action within tumor
cells. tumor resistance can be primary or acquired. in the
case of primary resistance, there is high physiologic expression of mdr proteins in the tissue from which the tumor
arises, as is seen in renal or hepatic tissues [2]. in other
cases, resistance is acquired, resulting from de novo mdr
protein overexpression following treatment with mdrinducing agents. although attempts have been made to
overcome mdr through treatment with reversal agents, to
date these have been largely unsuccessful (for a review, see
nobili et al. [3]).
in general, mechanisms of resistance to microtubule inhibitors (mtis) are somewhat different from those of other
drug classes in that alterations in the molecular target, tubulin, also can result in acquired resistance. for example,
expression of the ␤iii-tubulin isoform has been associated
with poor response to taxanes in non-small cell lung carcinoma (nsclc) [4], ovarian cancer [5], gastric cancer [6],
and prostate cancer [7]. furthermore, mutations in ␤-tubulin can also prevent taxanes from binding to their target [8],
and hence from stabilizing microtubules (the mechanism of
action of this class of agent). therefore, one avenue of antineoplastic drug development has focused on identifying
compounds that are less susceptible to these common drugresistance mechanisms; such agents may represent a clinically significant addition to the armamentarium of
treatment options that could be used to treat drug-resistant
cancer and ultimately extend survival.
one new class of agents that is of interest in this regard is the epothilones and their analogues. these are 16member macrolides produced by the myxobacterium
sorangium cellulosum [9, 10]. epothilones a and b, in
particular, have high in vitro antitumor activity through
their ability to disrupt microtubule dynamics, leading to
cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis [11]. although they share

two additional phase ii trials have evaluated the activity of  xxxd2410xxx  in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.  xxxd2410xxx  monotherapy produced prostate-specific
antigen (psa) declines of ⬎50% in 17% of patients with
hormone- and taxane-refractory prostate cancer, with a median survival time of 10.4 months [25]. a second trial evaluated the activity of  xxxd2410xxx  as a single agent or in
combination with  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate in chemotherapy-naïve prostate cancer patients progressing after castration. psa declines of ⬎50% were observed in 48% of
patients treated with  xxxd2410xxx  monotherapy and 68% of

patients treated with the combination regimen [26]. orrs
were 32% for  xxxd2410xxx  monotherapy and 48% for the
combination of  xxxd2410xxx  plus  xxxd2041xxx  [26]. efficacy results from  xxxd2410xxx  trials in resistant/pretreated
cancers are summarized in table 1. clinical trials comparing the efficacy and safety of  xxxd2410xxx  with those of taxanes are in progress in mbc patients. nonetheless, in
taxane-sensitive tumors, the activity of  xxxd2410xxx  appears
to be comparable with that of other chemotherapeutic
agents [27].

 xxxd2410xxx : in vitro activity in
drug-resistant cell lines
 xxxd2410xxx  is highly active in vitro, with cytotoxicity
demonstrated against a panel of 21 cell lines derived
from breast, lung, prostate, colon, and ovarian cancers,
as well as leukemias [15]. fifty percent inhibitory concentration values of  xxxd2410xxx  in these cell lines are
low, in the range of 1.4 –34.5 nm. importantly, in vitro
activity is retained in cell lines selected for resistance to
paclitaxel, including the hct116/vm46 colon and
a2780tax ovarian cancer lines, which are resistant to
paclitaxel as a result of overexpression of mdr proteins
[33] and a mutation in ␤-tubulin [34], respectively. clonogenic cell-killing experiments further demonstrate
that, while paclitaxel and  xxxd2410xxx  display similar
cell-killing activity against paclitaxel-sensitive cell
lines,  xxxd2410xxx  is substantially more cytotoxic than
paclitaxel against lines defined as paclitaxel resistant
[15] (table 2). moreover, in these paclitaxel-resistant
cell lines,  xxxd2410xxx  almost completely retains the antineoplastic activity it has against paclitaxel-sensitive cell
lines (table 2).

 xxxd2410xxx : preclinical activity in vivo
the observed in vitro activity of  xxxd2410xxx  against resistant tumor cell lines is recapitulated in vivo using
xenograft models with tumors derived from the cell lines
described above and from other drug-resistant cell lines
(table 2) [15]. these include xenografts displaying acquired resistance to paclitaxel through a range of mechanisms: mdr-mediated drug efflux, ␤-tubulin mutation,
and overexpression of the ␤iii-tubulin isoform. for example, activity is seen in the hct116/vm46 xenograft
model (described above) and in pat-7, which was established directly from an ovarian tumor biopsy immediately following the development of paclitaxel resistance
and expresses high levels of mdr and mrp1 [15]. the in
vivo activity of  xxxd2410xxx  in these models is consistent
with the low susceptibility of this agent to cell membrane
transporters such as p-gp and mrp1 [12]. importantly,
 xxxd2410xxx  does not appear to induce expression of the
mdr or mrp1 genes, a characteristic that could potentially prevent the development of cross-resistance with
other agents [12]. in vivo activity of  xxxd2410xxx  is also
seen in the a2780tax ovarian cancer xenograft model,
indicating that  xxxd2410xxx  is unaffected by the specific
point mutation in ␤ -tubulin that confers resistance to
paclitaxel in these cells.  xxxd2410xxx  also displays in vivo
activity in the pat-21 breast cancer xenograft model,
which is derived from a biopsy of a tumor that was clinically resistant to paclitaxel because of overexpression of

mors are investigating whether  xxxd2410xxx  can also be
safely combined with a variety of agents, including liposomal doxorubicin, bevacizumab, cetuximab, and  xxxd2008xxx 
(see http://www.clinicaltrials.gov). a phase ii study in advanced breast cancer demonstrated activity and an acceptable safety profile for  xxxd2410xxx  combined with
 xxxd425xxx  in taxane- and anthracycline-pretreated mbc
patients [28]. a large, randomized, phase iii trial comparing  xxxd2410xxx  plus  xxxd425xxx  with  xxxd425xxx  monotherapy demonstrated greater efficacy for the combination
with a significantly longer median pfs time (5.8 months
versus 4.2 months; p ⬍ .001) and higher response rate (35%
versus 14%; p ⬍ .001) [27].
in addition to these studies in tumors with acquired
resistance to chemotherapy,  xxxd2410xxx  has also been
shown to have activity in the treatment of cancers that are
typically considered chemotherapy resistant. for example,  xxxd2410xxx  has activity in rcc [20], suggesting that
this agent may represent a treatment option even for this
highly refractory disease [29] that is known to be one of
the tumors with the highest levels of endogenous mdr
[2].  xxxd2410xxx  also demonstrated marked activity
against advanced pancreatic cancer in a phase ii study,
resulting in a 6-month survival rate (the primary endpoint) of 60% [19]. this disease currently has a very poor
prognosis, even following treatment with gemcitabine,
the current standard of care [30].
the main toxicities typically associated with  xxxd2410xxx  treatment (administered at a dose of 40 mg/m2 every 3
weeks) are neutropenia, sensory neuropathy, fatigue, arthralgias, myalgias, and stomatitis. these adverse effects
are often manageable with dose modifications/supportive
therapy, and the sensory neuropathy has been reversible in
most cases once treatment is modified or stopped. various
phase ii studies conducted with alternative dosing of  xxxd2410xxx  (administered at a dose of 6 mg/m2 as a 1-hour i.v.
infusion on days 1–5 every 3 weeks) have reported a lower
rate of grade 3 or 4 sensory neuropathy. these include taxane-pretreated mbc (n ⫽ 37; rate, 3%), taxane-naïve mbc
(n ⫽ 22; rate, 0%), and platinum-pretreated/refractory
nsclc (n ⫽ 69; rate, 6%) [16, 18, 31].
overall survival for mbc patients has improved over
the past 5 years with the introduction of multiple, new active agents [32]. however, drug-resistant disease is an increasing clinical challenge, and  xxxd2410xxx  (or other
members of this novel drug class) may prove to be of value
in this context, based on the clinical experience to date [17,
23, 24]. the remainder of this review focuses on the characteristics of  xxxd2410xxx  at a preclinical level, which may,
at least in part, explain the activity observed in the clinical
setting.

␤iii-tubulin and downregulation of the ␤ii isoform [14].
preclinical experiments have demonstrated that, unlike
paclitaxel,  xxxd2410xxx  can bind multiple isoforms of
␤-tubulin, including the ␤iii isoform [14]. these results
are consistent with the recent demonstration, through
computational methods, that  xxxd2014xxx  a displays no
preference for either the ␤i- or ␤iii-tubulin isoform [35].
importantly, in addition to the xenograft models described above,  xxxd2410xxx  is also active in vivo against a
pancreatic tumor xenograft displaying intrinsic insensitivity to paclitaxel [15]. this tumor xenograft, pat-26, was derived from a liver metastasis in a pancreatic cancer patient
who had never received chemotherapy, suggesting that  xxxd2410xxx  may also provide clinical benefit to patients with
cancers considered intrinsically resistant to the currently
available agents. in all cases described above, the antitumor
activity of  xxxd2410xxx  (as measured by log-cell kill) was
3.0 to 5.3-fold greater than that of paclitaxel.
in summary, these findings, together with the in vitro findings described above, demonstrate that  xxxd2410xxx  has high

activity against a wide range of tumor types in the preclinical
setting. moreover,  xxxd2410xxx  has lower susceptibility to several key mechanisms of tumor resistance. it is these two characteristics of  xxxd2410xxx  that collectively underlie the clinical
activity of this agent across tumor types, including heavily pretreated and drug-resistant tumors.

mode of action of  xxxd2410xxx 
like the natural epothilones a and b,  xxxd2410xxx  promotes
tumor cell death by stabilizing microtubules and inducing
apoptosis [36], and is a highly active mti [15]. significantly,
 xxxd2410xxx  induces apoptosis through multiple pathways that
appear to be selective to this class of agents, including enhancement of caspase-2 activity [37] and p53-mediated activation of the death effector bax via induction of puma (p53
upregulated modulator of apoptosis) expression [38]. in contrast, taxanes mediate apoptosis primarily via caspase 9 activation [36]. these differences in mode of action may, at least
in part, underlie the activity of  xxxd2410xxx  against multiple tumor types that are resistant and/or refractory to taxanes.

agent also retains activity against paclitaxel-resistant cell lines
overexpressing ␤iii-tubulin or bearing ␤-tubulin mutations, as
observed for  xxxd2410xxx . phase ii studies have demonstrated
the activity of  xxxd2854xxx  against drug-resistant disease, including rcc and relapsed/refractory ovarian cancer [45, 46],
and phase iii studies are in progress.  xxxd2014xxx  ( xxxd2014xxx ;  xxxd2014xxx ) also has demonstrated preclinical activity against a number of mdr xenografts, including the
doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer line mcf7 (see goodin et
al. [47]). clinically, phase ii efficacy of  xxxd2014xxx  has been
shown in anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated mbc patients
[48, 49]. the fully synthetic  xxxd2854xxx  analogue zk-epo
also has demonstrated in vivo preclinical activity against resistant tumor cell lines, including breast, colorectal, ovarian,
lung, and pancreatic cancer, glioma, and melanoma models
[50, 51]. preliminary clinical results show that zk-epo has
some activity in taxane-pretreated or resistant breast cancer
[52] and uterine cancer [53]. in a phase ii trial in patients with
platinum-resistant ovarian cancer that evaluated two dosing
schedules of zk-epo, an orr of 19% was reported [54]. finally, the  xxxd2014xxx  analogue kos-1584 (dehydelone) has
been shown to have preclinical activity against a range of tumor types, including paclitaxel-resistant lymphoblastic leukemia and nsclc [55]. dehydelone is at a very early stage of
clinical development, but preliminary data from a phase i trial
suggest that this agent led to minor responses or disease stabilization in some patients with various tumors [56, 57].

conclusions
because of the high incidence of tumor resistance to available
chemotherapeutic agents, there is a pressing need for new antineoplastics with efficacy in patients with drug-resistant disease. the epothilones and their analogues are a class of highly
active mtis that have low susceptibility to several mechanisms of tumor resistance. the  xxxd2854xxx  analogue  xxxd2410xxx  has been approved as monotherapy or in combination
with  xxxd425xxx  for the treatment of resistant/refractory
mbc and has been shown to have promising clinical activity
against various other tumor types. the unique mode of binding
of  xxxd2410xxx  to its therapeutic target, its activation of selective apoptotic pathways, and its low susceptibility to multiple
mechanisms of tumor resistance are important properties that
underlie the clinical activity of this agent. the outcomes of
clinical studies with other agents in this class and further clinical development of  xxxd2410xxx , including its use in earlier
stages of breast cancer, are eagerly awaited.

taxane-pretreated mbc (nct00080301) has been completed and demonstrated superior efficacy for the combination of  xxxd2410xxx  plus  xxxd425xxx , with a significantly
longer median pfs time and higher response rate [24].
based on its activity,  xxxd2410xxx  was approved by the u.s.
food and drug administration in combination with  xxxd425xxx  for the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer resistant to an anthracycline
and a taxane. in addition, in view of data obtained in phase
ii trials,  xxxd2410xxx  was approved as monotherapy for the
treatment of metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer in
patients whose tumors are resistant or refractory to anthracyclines, taxanes, and  xxxd425xxx .
a second phase iii study in patients with anthracyclinepretreated, taxane-resistant mbc (nct00082433) has completed recruitment of patients [39]. that study will examine
overall survival in the taxane-resistant patient population.
once an agent has demonstrated efficacy in the metastatic
setting, it is of great interest to evaluate the same agent in earlier stages of disease, where maximum benefit can be obtained. various studies have shown that, in the neoadjuvant
setting, mdr expression may represent one of the main determinants of resistance to chemotherapy in breast cancer patients [40, 41]. thus, early disease may provide an opportunity
to assess the activity of  xxxd2410xxx  in mdr-related resistant
breast cancer.  xxxd2410xxx , therefore, has also been evaluated
as a single agent in the neoadjuvant setting for breast cancer
[42]. a pathologic complete response in the breast (pcrb) was
observed in 18% of patients after four cycles of therapy [42].
in addition, 32% of patients were able to undergo breastconserving surgery [42]. the 18% pcrb rate reported after
four cycles of  xxxd2410xxx  compared favorably with the pcrb
rates in studies of single-agent taxanes administered for four
cycles of neoadjuvant therapy [42].
other epothilones are also undergoing clinical evaluation,
and have been shown to have activity in the drug-resistant setting. of these,  xxxd2854xxx  ( xxxd2854xxx , natural  xxxd2854xxx ) is
furthest along in development.  xxxd2854xxx  has demonstrated
preclinical in vitro and in vivo activity against a range of tumor
lines [13, 43, 44], including those overexpressing mdr proteins [11, 13, 43]. it will now be of interest to see whether this
