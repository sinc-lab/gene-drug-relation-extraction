endogenous  xxxd3244xxx -estradiol (e2 ) and low parenteral doses of exogenous e2 are vasodilators. high dose estrogens,
especially  xxxd2054xxx  (ee) and  xxxd2581xxx , stimulate the synthesis of hepatic proteins including coagulation
factors,  xxxg2066xxx , and  xxxg99xxx  (aogen). in the steady state, high plasma levels of
aogen produce only a very small increase of angiotensin h (all) and plasma renin activity, because ah inhibits
the secretion of renin and lowers plasma renin concentration. however, the increase in ah is sufficient for a
slight reduction in renal blood flow and a slight increase in exchangeable sodium and blood pressure; in
susceptible women, blood pressure may rise considerably. effects of estrogens on the brain may also be involved
in blood pressure changes. endogenous progesterone is a  xxxg1602xxx  antagonist. endogenous or
exogenous progesterone leads to sodium loss and a compensatory increase in renin secretion, plasma renin
activity, all, and plasma aldosterone, e.g. in the second half of the menstrual cycle, synthetic progestogens are
commonly devoid of the  xxxg1602xxx  antagonistic effect of progesterone, and some are weak
 xxxg730xxx  agonists. combined use of ee and synthetic progestogens may therefore enhance estrogen
effects on body sodium and blood pressure. a new progestogen ( xxxd1946xxx ) with an antimineralocorticoid
effect like that of progesterone is described that slightly lowers body weight and blood pressure in a contraceptive
formulation together with ee. an almost ideal oral contraceptive would be a progestogen like  xxxd1946xxx 
together with a low dose natural estrogen that does not stimulate aogen synthesis. since most oral formulations
for postmenopausal estrogen replacement also stimulate hepatic protein synthesis (including aogen) to some
extent, the transdermal route of e2 application for contraceptive purposes should also be investigated, since it
has a reduced potential for undesirable side effects. (steroids 61:166--171, 1996)

introduction
the effects of female sex hormones on the circulatory system have been a major focus of interest in the last three
decades for the following reasons. (1) after the menopause,
the prevalence of hypertension and coronary heart disease
markedly increases in women. (2) the widespread use of
the first generation of hormonal oral contraceptives has led
to an increase in thromboembolism and hypertension in
young women. (3) there are increasing concerns about the
benefit:side effect ratio of postmenopausal sex hormone
"replacement" therapy.

ago contained higher dosages of estrogen and progestogen
than their modern equivalents. around 1965 it was noted
that some women became hypertensive while taking the
pill, and even malignant hypertension with renal failure was
observed in some cases.l'2 in a prospective study conducted
in the early 1970s, the average increase of blood pressure in
oc users over that in users of mechanical contraceptive
devices was about 15/5 mm. 3
since orally administered estrogens have to pass the liver
and en route enhance the synthesis of numerous proteins
including  xxxg99xxx , 4 hypertension caused by estrogens and ocs was rapidly linked to a presumed activation
of the renin-aldosterone system (ras).
progestogenic components of ocs are either derivatives
of progesterone substituted at c-17 or derivatives of 19-nortestosterone. both groups of progestogens are devoid of the
antimineralocorticoid activity of progesterone, which in0039-128x/96/$15.00

estrogens, gestagens, renin, and blood pressure: oelkers
duces natriuresis and a compensatory activation of the ras
in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and during pregnancy. 5-9 derivatives of 19-nor-testosterone, like  xxxd2751xxx  acetate, may even be partial  xxxg730xxx  agonists and may thus lead to sodium retention. 9 since the daily
ingestion of 50 ~g of  xxxd2054xxx  (ee), the most frequently used estrogenic component of ocs, also induces
sodium retention,~vthe combination of a sodium-retaining
progestogen with ee may predispose to arterial hypertension. new progestogens like levonorgestrel,  xxxd1849xxx , or
gestodene are probably devoid of a significant sodiumretaining effect, but they still lack the natriuretic action of
progesterone. it is, therefore, not surprising that modem low
dose ocs still lead to a significant increase in blood pressure,~ ~-~5 although less so than the high dose formulations
of 30 years ago.

effects of natural and synthetic estrogens on
blood pressure and vascular reactivity
the more pronounced increase in mean blood pressure in
women than men after the fifth decade has led to the assumption that before the menopause women are protected
from hypertension by endogenous estrogens. long term effects of physiological levels of estradiol on blood pressure
are difficult to study. short term studies in castrated ewes
show that 1 ~g/kg body weight of estradiol (e2) i.v. leads to
systemic vasodilation and tachycardia within 90 min, the
time required for the hormone to exert its effects via nuclear
receptors. the effect was shown to be independent of vasodilation in the uterine vascular bed. ~6 the short term direct effect of e2 on rabbit coronary arteries is also vasodilatory, and vasoconstrictor effects of  xxxg674xxx  are
blunted, j7"18 it has recently even been shown that in postmenopausal women with coronary artery disease (stable angina pectoris) sublingual application of 1 mg of e2, 40 min
before an ergometer test, significantly increases exercise
tolerance compared with placebo, w
studies on effects of higher doses of e2 on blood pressure have produced controversial results. ueda et al. 2° attempted to simulate the circulatory changes of pregnancy in
ovariectomized ewes by injecting high doses of e2 for 3
weeks. blood pressure fell in spite of sodium retention and
a gain in weight. conrad et al., 2~ however, in testing the
reactivity to several vasoconstrictors in ovariectomized rats
implanted with high dose e2 pellets for 3 weeks, found no
effect compared with unsubstituted rats. in transgenic female rats carrying the mouse renin 2 gene (a new model of
renin-dependent hypertension), ovariectomy and placebo
treatment led to a higher mean blood pressure than treatment with 70 p~g of e2 daily (a pharmacological dose) for 4
weeks. similar trends were observed in non-transgenic
ovariectomized sprague-dawley rats. 22 this estrogen effect
in transgenic rats may be mediated by enhanced formation
of  xxxd2738xxx  in resistance blood vessels. 22
 xxxd2581xxx  is a pro-drug, from which ee is formed by the
liver. intraperitoneal injection of 15 p,g of  xxxd2581xxx  twice
weekly into female rats led to a significant increase of systolic blood pressure within 4 weeks. it was assumed that an
enhanced formation of catecholestrogens in the brain might
contribute to blood pressure elevation by an interaction be-

tween these steroids and the sympathetic nervous system. 23
a blood pressure-raising effect of  xxxd2581xxx , although with
a lag period of 6 months, was also described by fowler et
al.24spellacy and birk 25 treated 32 postmenopausal women
with 50 ixg of ee or 80 txg of  xxxd2581xxx  per day for 6
months and observed variable increments in blood pressure.
after prolonged administration of 1.25 mg of conjugated
estrogens per day for several months or years, reversible
increments in blood pressure have also been observed, 26"27
but reports on hypertension caused by postmenopausal natural estrogen ingestion are rare compared with hypertension
due to combined oc therapy.
the partly contradictory effects of low and high dose
estrogens, between the oral and parenteral route of administration, and between natural estrogens on one hand and ee
and  xxxd2581xxx  on the other can probably be explained by
their different effects on the liver, especially the enhancement of aogen synthesis.

effects of estrogens on the
renin-aldosterone system
the large amount of estrogens secreted by the placenta during [?regnancy leads to a massive increase of plasma aog e n j due to  xxxg730xxx -mediated stimulation of
transcription of the aogen gene in the liver. 29 the midcycle
increase of e2 in healthy women, however, is not sufficient
to induce measurable increments in plasma aogen. the oral
ingestion of 50-60 ixg (or even of 15 p.g) per day of ee as
a constituent of a combined oc leads to an increase of
plasma aogen within a few days (figure 1), which is only
slightly less than that seen during pregnancy. 4'3°'31 although stimulation of hepatic aogen synthesis is a common
feature of natural estrogens and of ee, the latter is much
more potent in this regard. 32'33 ee has a tightly bound 17o~-ethinyl group, which leads to a very long half-life and to
high ee exposure of the liver as a result of enterohepatic
recycling of the unmetabolized drug. thus, in relation to its
gonadotropin-suppressive effect, ee is a much stronger enhancer of hepatic protein (e.g. aogen) synthesis than e2 or
other natural estrogens. 33'34 two mg of oral micronized e2
or e2 valerate per day and similar doses of percutaneous e2
lead to similar plasma e2 concentration in postmenopausal
women. 35'36 oral e2 significantly raises plasma aogen, but
not so percutaneous e2. with moderate dosages of e2, it is
therefore the hepatic first-pass effect that is responsible for
aogen synthesis. this is not the case for ee, due to its
unique metabolism. goebelsmann et al.33 have shown that
the ratio between the gonadotropin-suppressing and the hepatic protein-inducing effect is the same whether the drug is
administered by the oral or by the vaginal route. table 1 is
an overview of the relative potencies of different estrogens
administered by different routes on plasma aogen concentration.
the combined low dose ocs on the market at present
exert their effect on aogen and on the ras almost exclusively via their estrogenic component. the question is then
of the mechanism whereby an increase in aogen can lead to
hypertension. the formation of  xxxg99xxx  in plasma is
determined by active plasma renin concentration (prc) and
by aogen concentration, since the latter in the normal state

is close to the michaelis-menten constant of the reninsubstrate reaction. the rate of angiotensin formation in
plasma in vitro at 37°c is called plasma renin activity
(pra). the pra closely correlates with plasma angiotensin
ii (all), because  xxxg36xxx  activity is
not rate-limiting. if a normotensive woman takes an oc
containing 30 or 50 ixg of ee, plasma aogen triples within
a week, but pra and all rise only marginally, 28'3° due to
"short loop feedback inhibition" of renin secretion by the
slightly raised aii level. 4 renin secretion and prc are,
therefore, chronically suppressed in women taking dosages
of estrogen that stimulate plasma aogen. although aii is
only marginally increased in those women, suppression of
renin secretion is itself an indicator of the functional relevance of all elevation.
twenty years ago hollenberg et al. 37 compared renal
plasma flow (rpf) in women using ocs with controls and
found significant reductions in rpf in oc users, and a negative correlation between plasma aii and rpf. the decreased rpf was therefore probably due to the slight increase in all, which in turn may lead to sodium retention
and hypertension in susceptible individuals.
it is likely that marked increments of pra reported in the
older literature in women taking 50 or more txg per day of
ee are partly caused by methodological problems with pra
measurement. derkx et al. 2s recently showed that keeping a
blood or plasma sample of a woman taking ee for 2 h at
0°c leads to partial activation of pro-renin and thus to spuriously high pra measurement.
in a review on the role of renin substrate in hypertension,
gordon 38 comes to the conclusion that a positive correlation
between blood pressure and plasma aogen in a wide variety
of clinical conditions and in animal experiments means that
high aogen can be a causal factor in hypertension. the
marked decrease in prc in response to an increase in aogen is a counterregulatory mechanism that may not compensate completely for the primary disturbance of the steady
state. it has indeed been suggested by saruta e t al. 39'¢° that
a diminished feedback suppression of renin secretion could
be a cause of hypertension in some women taking combined

effects of oral  xxxd2054xxx  (ee) and oral or percutaneous estradiol (e2) (micronized or valerate) on plasma antiotensino-

figure 2 increasing requirement of mineralocorticoid (9~fluor-cortisol (9-c~-f-hc)) substitution in a 33-year-old addisonian woman during pregnancy. to avoid hyperkalemia, due to
the antimineralocorticoid effect of rising plasma progesterone,
9c~-fluor-cortisol had to be increased from 100 ijg daily before
to 600 ijg at the end of pregnancy. pra, plasma renin activity.

ocs. macarevey et al. 41 compared 6 women becoming
hypertensive while taking the pill (group l) with 6 agematched women with essential hypertension (group 2).
group 1 had markedly higher plasma aii levels than group
2, while active prc and plasma aldosterone were almost
identical. since total exchangeable sodium was slightly
higher in group 1 than 2, the authors concluded that group
1 patients may have had aii-dependent hypertension. the
blood pressure-raising effect of aii varies with the sodium
state of the body, increasing when body sodium is high and
decreasing when it is l o w . 42 at present, the reninangiotensin mechanism is the most serious candidate as mediator of the effects of supraphysiological dosages of estrogens on blood pressure; in addition, possible direct effects
of estrogens on the brain and the central sympathetic nervous system need further scrutiny.

effects of progesterone and synthetic
progestogens on the ras and blood pressure
progesterone has a natriuretic 5 8' 9'4 3' and blood pressure lowering effect,44 mainly due to its competition with mineralo-

corticoids for the type i corticosteroid receptor. 43'45 daily
injections of 50 mg of progesterone for 3 weeks significantly lowered exchangeable body sodium in man.~° as a
consequence, pra (and probably prc), plasma aii, and
aldosterone rise in a compensatory fashion, while aogen
remains unchanged. 7'9 the rise in pra, aii, and aldosterone in the second half of the menstrual cycle is caused by
progesterone, since suppression of ovulation with a  xxxg1602xxx  inert synthetic progestogen abolishes
the activation of the ras.46 the increase of pra, prc, and
aldosterone in pregnancy is also largely due to the renal
effects of progesterone, but in contrast to the luteal phase of
the menstrual cycle, plasma aogen levels are also increased
due to the very high placental estrogen production.
other examples for the physiological importance of the
antimineralocorticoid properties of progesterone are the following clinical observations. (1) a few years ago we observed a woman with primary hyperaldosteronism (adrenal
adenoma), whose serum potassium and blood pressure completely normalized during pregnancy, with recurrence of
hypokalemia and hypertension after delivery. the dramatic
change of blood pressure and serum potassium appears certainly due to the high progesterone plasma levels. (2) we
have closely observed two women with addison's disease
during pregnancy. before pregnancy, they had normal serum potassium and blood pressure while taking 25 mg of
hydrocortisone and 0.1 mg per day of 9-c~-fluor-cortisol. in
parallel with the rise in progesterone during pregnancy, the
dosage of 9-~-fluor-cortisol had to be increased to 0.3 in
one patient and 0.6 mg per day in the other to keep blood
pressure and serum potassium in the normal range (figure
2). (3) many untreated patients with the simple virilizing
(non-salt losing) form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency have
high renin and aldosterone levels. the reason for this is
probably the high plasma progesterone and the very high
17-oh-progesterone levels (the steroids before the enzyme
block) occupying mineralocorticoid receptors and causing
sodium loss that is then reflected by a compensatory rise in

experience with a novel type of
antimineralocorticoid progestogen and outlook
over the last few years, we have had the opportunity to
study the effects of  xxxd1946xxx  ( xxxd1946xxx ), a progestogen
which includes a 17- xxxd3238xxx  group, in normal young
women. its antimineralocorticoid potency in the rat and in
man is about 8 times greater than that of spironolactone.48
administration of 2 mg per day of  xxxd1946xxx  for 6 days to
young women on a constant moderately low sodium diet led
to a cumulative sodium loss of 84 mmol in comparison with
placebo, and a significant increase of pra and plasma aldosterone. 46 the mild natriuresis induced by this dose of
 xxxd1946xxx  was similar in magnitude to that induced by the injection of 50 mg of progesterone per day for 6 days in a
previous study. 9 in six other normally menstruating women,
ingestion of 2 mg per day of  xxxd1946xxx  from day 5 through 25
of a menstrual cycle suppressed ovulation and abolished the
rise in plasma progesterone.46 a combination of 3 mg of
 xxxd1946xxx  with 15, 20, or 30 p,g of ee was then tested in groups
of 20 women as potential oral contraceptives in comparison
with a standard oc containing 150 ixg of levonorgestrel (a
19-nor-testosterone derivative) and 30 p,g of ee (microgynon®). the women were studied during an oc-free control
cycle and thereafter for 6 months on treatment, with 1 week
per month off the pill. 3~ plasma aogen rose to the same
extent in all four groups in response to ee, while pra and
plasma aldosterone rose significantly only in the groups
taking  xxxd1946xxx  as progestogen. this was probably due to
sodium loss induced by the novel progestogen, as indicated
by a small but significant fall in body weight, in contrast to
the microgynon® group where weight increased by 0.7 kg.
in the microgynon® group diastolic blood pressure rose by
about 2 mm hg, and fell by 2-4 mm hg in the  xxxd1946xxx  groups
(figure 3). cycle control with the new oc formulation was
very good, and the plasma lipid profile appears to be favorably modified. 31 a combined oc containing  xxxd1946xxx  or other
progestogens that retain the antimineralocorticoid property
of progesterone may thus be beneficial for women who
experience an increase in weight or blood pressure on other
oc formulations, or for women commencing oc treatment
with mild arterial hypertension or "idiopathic edema."

another major goal for the development of a new generation of hormonal contraceptives would be the avoidance
of the stimulation of hepatic proteins by their estrogenic
component. ee does not only stimulate aogen synthesis but
also the synthesis of coagulation factors, while antithrombin
iii levels may be lowered. 36'39 an increase in spontaneous
blood coagulation is normally offset by an increase in fibrinolysis, 49 but ocs containing 20 or 30 p,g of ee are still
contraindicated in women with an increased risk of thromboembolism. as shown by the data in table 1, estradiol
applied transdermaily does not increase levels of these hepatic proteins. it would, therefore, be reasonable to consider
the development of transdermal contraceptives as efficient
antiovulants and safer than ocs in terms of their effects on
blood pressure and blood coagulation. since a drug being
used by a large number of young women should be as safe
as possible, research should be focused on the substitution
of ee by estradiol in contraceptive preparations and, if possible, on the avoidance of the oral route of administration.
pilot studies for developing transdermal hormonal contraceptive systems have already been performed with promising results, 5° a strategy which should be encouraged by
physicians and health service providers.
