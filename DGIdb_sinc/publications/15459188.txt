polyamines are ubiquitous cellular components that play
many roles in cellular physiology (1). bacteria such as escherichia coli can grow without polyamines albeit at a reduced rate
(2) and a greater susceptibility to oxidative damage (3). however, eukaryotes require spermidine (4). deletion of either the
 xxxg1626xxx  gene (5) or the  xxxd3156xxx 
decarboxylase gene (6) prevents synthesis of spermidine and is
lethal at very early embryonic stages in mice. it is possible that
this requirement is due to the fact that spermidine is needed as
a precursor of hypusine, a post-translational modification of
the protein eif-5a (7–9). this modification has been shown to
be essential for viability in yeast (10, 11). polyamines clearly

have multiple functions in addition to serving as precursors of
hypusine, and these may also provide essential functions particularly in higher eukaryotes. known functions of polyamines
include: interactions with dna and rna that can modulate
chromatin stability and gene expression; direct effects on activity of transcription factors, enzymes, and phospholipid membranes; anti-oxidant effects; and interactions with ion channels
(12–16). polyamines may also either promote or prevent apoptosis (17, 18). in most cases where polyamine functions unrelated to hypusine have been studied in vitro or in cultured cells,
both spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  are effective. this raises the
question as to why  xxxd3234xxx  is formed.
aminopropyltransferases are very widely distributed and
the basic active site motif has been identified in structural
studies (19). despite their similarity in this motif, there are two
totally distinct aminopropyltransferases in eukaryotes, spermidine synthase and  xxxg2181xxx , and there is no overlap in specificity (20, 21).  xxxd3234xxx  is normally a substantial
fraction of the total polyamine pool in such organisms. although it seems most unlikely that the capacity to synthesize
 xxxd3234xxx  has been so highly conserved without a specific function for  xxxd3234xxx , the specific functions of  xxxd3234xxx  remain
elusive, and yeast mutants that lack  xxxg2181xxx  are
viable and grow at a normal rate (22). similarly, cultured
mammalian cells that lack  xxxd3234xxx  due to either the use of
inhibitors of  xxxg2181xxx  or inactivation of the  xxxd3234xxx 
synthase gene (spms) are viable and grow normally (23–27). in
the more complex environment of a multicellular organism, it
remains possible that  xxxd3234xxx  is essential due to a requirement in some specialized cell type or to a need for  xxxd3234xxx 
under certain environments.
although one obvious way to examine this question is to
specifically inactivate the spms gene, it has not yet been
possible to obtain knockout mice with such a deletion. attempts
to generate mice that lack  xxxg2181xxx  by standard gene
deletion techniques have not been successful, since on the
129/svj background the mice lacking spms were not viable
(26). mice lacking  xxxg2181xxx  have been identified as a
result of exposure to mutagens. the male gyro (gy) mouse,
which is on the b6c3h background, has a chromosomal deletion of part of the x chromosome in the xp22.1 region, which
spans 160 –190 kb. this includes most of spms and at least one
other gene termed  xxxg1738xxx  (28 –30). the  xxxg1738xxx  gene product is
known to regulate phosphate metabolism in a way in which
loss of a single copy is dominant; both male gy and female xgy
mice have symptoms of hypophosphatemia. in addition to this,
the male gy mice have a variety of other phenotypic changes
that include inner ear abnormalities, deafness, hyperactivity,
circling behavior, sterility, a profound growth retardation, and
a propensity to sudden death (refs. 31 and 32 and references
therein). gy mice survive only on the b6c3h background;
attempts to transfer the gene deletion to other strains have not

spermidine is essential for viability in eukaryotes but
the importance of the longer polyamine  xxxd3234xxx  has
not been established.  xxxd3234xxx  is formed from spermidine by the action of  xxxg2181xxx , an aminopropyltransferase, whose gene (spms) is located on the x
chromosome. deletion of part of the x chromosome that
include spms in gy mice leads to a striking phenotype
in affected males that includes altered phosphate metabolism and symptoms of hypophosphatemic rickets,
circling behavior, hyperactivity, head shaking, inner
ear abnormalities, deafness, sterility, a profound postnatal growth retardation, and a propensity to sudden
death. it was not clear to what extent these alterations
were due to the loss of  xxxg2181xxx  activity, since
this chromosomal deletion extends well beyond the
spms gene and includes at least one other gene termed
 xxxg1738xxx . we have bred the gy carrier female mice with
transgenic mice (cag/spms mice) that express  xxxg2181xxx  from the ubiquitous cag promoter. the
resulting gy-cag/spms mice had extremely high levels
of  xxxg2181xxx  and contained  xxxd3234xxx  in all tissues examined. these mice had a normal life span and
fertility and a normal growth rate except for a reduction
in body weight due to a loss of bone mass that was
consistent with the observation that the derangement in
phosphate metabolism is due to the loss of the  xxxg1738xxx  gene
and was not restored. these results show that  xxxd3234xxx 
synthesis is needed for normal growth, viability, and
fertility in male mice and that regulation of  xxxd3234xxx 
synthase content is not required.

experimental procedures

materials—all chemicals, unless noted, were purchased from sigma.
oligodeoxyribonucleotides used as primers were synthesized in the
macromolecular core facility, pennsylvania state university college
of medicine. the reagents used for pcr genotyping, taq dna polymerase, and an ultrapure dntp set were purchased from promega
(madison, wi) and amersham biosciences, respectively.35s-labeled
decarboxylated  xxxd3156xxx  was synthesized from l-[35s]methionine
(perkinelmer life sciences) (24, 37).
polyamine and enzyme analysis—polyamine content was determined by hplc using an ion pair reverse phase high performance
liquid chromatography separation method with post-column derivatization using o-phthalaldehyde as described previously (38).  xxxd3234xxx 
synthase assays were carried out by measuring the production of
[35s] xxxd2619xxx  from 35s-labeled decarboxylated  xxxd3156xxx  in
the presence of the appropriate amine acceptor as described previously
(24, 37).
mice—heterozygous gy mice were a kind gift from dr. r. a. meyer,
jr. of the department of orthopaedic surgery, carolinas medical center, charlotte, nc. other gy mice were purchased from the jackson
laboratory (bar harbor, me). xgy carrier females were bred with
b6c3h males from the jackson laboratory. female offspring were
retained and the heterozygous females carrying the gy deletion required for breeding identified by phosphate analyses of blood plasma
(31). the gy males resulting from the breeding of these mice were
identified by pcr using genomic dna isolated from the tails (using the
dneasy tissue kit, qiagen, inc., valencia, ca). the 5⬘ sense primer
used was 5⬘-ggtgttgctggaccttcaga-3⬘, and the 3⬘ antisense
primer was 5⬘-cccagtactgtcttgactca-3⬘. the amplified product
at the predicted size of 631 bp was absent in gy mice and present in
controls. a band corresponding to 144 bp, which is the size derived from
an inactive pseudogene, was present in both normal and gy males
(24, 28).
the cag/spms mice were generated by dna microinjection of fertilized b6d2f2 oocytes using a 3.5-kb fragment released by sali and
bamhi digestion from plasmid pcag-hspmsyn, which was constructed by replacing the insert encoding green fluorescent protein in
plasmid pcx-egfp (34, 35) with the human  xxxg2181xxx  cdna
(33). genomic dna was isolated from the tails as above and subjected
to pcr analysis to identify mice bearing the transgene. for identification of the cag/spms, the 5⬘ sense primer used was 5⬘-ttcggcttctggcgtgtgac-3⬘, which corresponds to a sequence in the actin promoter region and the 3⬘ antisense primer was 5⬘-ccagtactgtcctgactc-3⬘, which corresponds to nucleotides 300 –317 in the
 xxxg2181xxx  coding sequence. a 440-bp fragment was produced
from the transgene.
phosphate assays—the plasma level of phosphate was measured by
a colorimetric assay. blood from a retro-orbital bleed was collected in
heparinized microcentrifuge tubes and spun at 14,000 rpm (15,000 ⫻ g)
for 15 min, and then plasma was prepared for analysis. aliquots of 20

␮l of plasma were mixed with 1.35 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid and
centrifuged at 14,000 rpm (15,000 ⫻ g) for 10 min. one ml of supernatant was placed into a clean glass tube and mixed with 2 ml of 2%
 xxxd228xxx , 0.5% ammonium molybdate, and 1.2 n h2so4. samples
were then incubated at 37 °c for 90 min and cooled for 10 min at room
temperature, and absorbance was measured on a spectrophotometer at
820 nm.
histology and immunohistochemistry—tissues were fixed in methyl
carnoy’s solution (60% methanol, 30% chloroform, and 10% acetic acid)
for 24 h. the fixed testes were embedded in paraffin wax, and 5-␮m
sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological
analysis.
staining for pcna1 was carried out as follows. after deparaffinization and rehydration, sections were incubated with 3%  xxxd2298xxx  to quench endogenous peroxidases. antigen retrieval was performed by heating to 92 °c in antigen unmasking solution (vector
h-3300) three times with 5-min incubations in between in a microwave
at 20% power. slides were cooled to room temperature for at least 30
min. they were then blocked with nonspecific serum (10% goat serum
in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine  xxxg124xxx ,
vector s-1000) for 1 h. the slides were then incubated with mouse
anti-pcna monoclonal antibody (1:500; santa cruz biotechnology catalog number sc-56) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine  xxxg124xxx  overnight at 4 °c. they were then incubated with
biotinylated goat anti-mouse igg polyclonal antibody (1:500; dako catalog number e0433) for 45 min followed by streptavidin-horseradish
peroxidase (1:1000; dako catalog number p0397). immunostaining was
detected with aec peroxidase substrate kit (vector sk-4200) and counter-stained with hematoxylin qs (vector h-3404). slides were dehydrated and mounted with permount (cytoseal-60). digital photographs
were taken with a nikon-tms microscope and nikon coolpix 950
camera.
results

restoration of polyamines in gy mice—in agreement with
previous reports (24, 28, 29), tissues of male gy mice had no
 xxxg2181xxx  activity (table i) and contained insignificant amounts of  xxxd3234xxx  (table ii).  xxxd3234xxx  was restored
in the tissues in the gy-cag/spms mice (table ii). although
the amount of  xxxg2181xxx  that is produced from the
cag-driven transgene is greatly in excess of that present in
normal mice (table i), the  xxxd3234xxx  levels in the gy-cag/
spms mice were only slightly elevated in most tissues
(table ii).
tissues from the gy mice have a large increase in spermidine
compared with normal mice, which is consistent with the in1

been successful. there was a complete absence of  xxxd3234xxx  in
tissues of the male gy mice (24, 28, 29). these results suggest
that the absence of  xxxd3234xxx  may be the cause of some or all of
the alterations in male gy mice described above.
to examine this possibility, we have bred the xgy carrier
female mice with transgenic male cag/spms mice from lines 8
and 21 (33). these mice express  xxxg2181xxx  under the
control of a composite cytomegalovirus-immediate early enhancer/chicken ␤-actin promoter, which was designed to provide ubiquitous expression (34 –36). assays of the  xxxd3234xxx 
synthase activity in cag/spms lines 8 and 21 confirmed that
there was a high level of expression of the transgene in many
different organs and that this was maintained for at least one
year (33). the male gy-cag/spms mice resulting from crossing these lines with female xgy mice contained  xxxd3234xxx  (with
a slightly higher  xxxd3234xxx :spermidine ratio than present in
controls), and the normal life span and fertility were restored.
they also grew at a normal rate, although their body weight
was reduced slightly compared with controls. this reduction is
probably due to the hypophosphatemia, which was not affected
by the spms transgene. these results establish that, in mammals,  xxxd3234xxx  synthesis is needed for normal viability,
growth, and fertility.

ability to further metabolize this polyamine (table ii). this
increase was completely prevented in the gy-cag/spms mice
in which there was frequently a small decrease in spermidine
compared with the normal mice. this decrease in spermidine
and small increase in  xxxd3234xxx  results in a statistically significant rise in  xxxd3234xxx :spermidine ratio in most tissues of the
gy-cag/spms mice compared with normal mice. this alteration in ratio was also seen in the cag/spms mice compared
with normals as reported previously (33).
although the results shown in table ii were for polyamines
measured at 1 month, the alterations in polyamine metabolism
described above were also seen in mice that were 1 year old
(results not shown). none of the tissues from gy mice of this
age contained  xxxd3234xxx ; the  xxxd3234xxx  levels in the gy-cag/
spms mice were similar to control values, and the rise in

spermidine in the gy mice was completely prevented in the
gy-cag/spms mice.
survival, growth, and behavior of gy and gy-cag/spms
mice—the gy mice had a very poor survival over the first 10
weeks of life with sudden death occurring in more than 70% of
the population. in contrast, the gy-cag/spms mice showed no
mortality over this time period (fig. 1 and results not shown)
and were kept for 1 year with no difference in survival from
normal mice (fig. 1). the poor viability of the gy mice is
reflected in the numbers of gy mice that survive to the time of
weaning. in previous studies in our laboratory after breeding
xgy carrier females with normal males, less than the expected
25% of offspring surviving to weaning were gy males (24). this
difference was also seen in the current experiments and it was
corrected in the gy-cag/spms mice. at 21 days of age, there

were 17% gy males (significantly less than the expected 25%)
and 26% gy-cag/spms mice in 91 male offspring from the
breeding of xy females with cag/spms males.
in contrast to the gy mice that were much smaller than the
corresponding normal males, the gy-cag/spms were not noticeably different from normal mice or cag/spms mice for the
first 4 weeks of life (fig. 2). at later ages, the gy-cag/spms
were slightly smaller than the control or cag/spms mice (fig.
2), but at all times their body weight was more than twice that
of gy mice of the same age. the small reduction in body weight
is likely to be related to hypophosphatemia in these mice. the
phosphate level, which is significantly decreased in gy mice,
was not increased in the gy-cag/spms mice (table iii). the
hypophosphatemia in gy mice leads to rickets/osteomalacia
(31, 32). the femur length in the 12-month-old gy mice was
significantly reduced, and this decrease was not fully reversed
in the gy-cag/spms mice.
gy mice were originally named for their hyperactivity and
circling behavior (31, 32). this trait, which is more easily
observed at older ages, was also completely abolished in the
gy-cag/spms mice.
fertility of gy and gy-cag/spms mice—the gy mice were
sterile, as reported previously (31, 32). histological examination of the seminiferous tubules in these mice revealed a large
decrease in the number of meiotic and postmeiotic cells (fig. 3).
the proportion of cells staining positive for pcna was increased in every layer of the seminiferous tubules in the gy
mice indicating that the cells remained at spermatogonia and
early stage primary spermatocytes and rarely progressed to
spermatozoa (fig. 4). these changes in the testicular histology
and pcna staining were totally reversed in the gy-cag/spms
mice (figs. 3 and 4). consistent with this, these mice were as
fertile as normal male mice. using the gy-cag/spms line,
breeding with normal b6c3h female mice or xgy female mice
or cag/spms female mice was readily accomplished. as expected, all of the female offspring from these crosses had at
least one gy gene. there were no viable gygy females from the
cross between gy-cag/spms and xgy, but there were 3/16
female offspring that had the gygy-cag/spms genotype. this
suggests that the absence of  xxxg2181xxx  activity may be
lethal in female mice in the mixed b6c3h/b6d2 background.
comparison of gy-cag/spms-8 and gy-cag/spms-21
mice—lines 8 and 21 of the cag/spms mice, which were
derived from two different founder animals, had very similar
levels of  xxxg2181xxx  with a high degree of overexpression in all lines (33). the studies for which results are shown

characterization of the cag/spms mice has indicated that
despite the very large increase in  xxxg2181xxx  activity in
many tissues, there was only a modest change in cellular polyamines with a consistent but small rise in the  xxxd3234xxx :spermidine ratio (33). these results indicate that, as long as a
certain critical level is exceeded, the absolute level of  xxxd3234xxx 
synthase activity is not a critical factor in maintaining cellular
polyamines. other regulatory factors, which have not currently
been identified, are sufficient to maintain polyamine levels.
the finding that the gy-cag/spms mice have relatively similar levels of polyamines to normal littermates in all of the
tissues examined (table ii) is therefore consistent with previous studies. the even closer similarity in polyamine content
between the gy-cag/spms and cag/spms mice is not surprising, since the additional  xxxg2181xxx  contributed by
the endogenous gene in the latter strain is minimal compared
with the high level supplied from the transgene (table i and
ref. 33). the cag enhancer/promoter construct was designed
to give ubiquitous expression of transgenes by combining a
chicken ␤-actin promoter and a cytomegalovirus enhancer sequence. studies with mice in which it was used to produce
green fluorescent protein show general expression (34 –36).
our characterization of the cag/spms mice has indicated
expression of the transgene in all tissues examined, although
the  xxxg2181xxx  activity in the latter was greatest in
heart and muscle, which may relate to the ␤-actin promoter in
the cag construct (33). therefore it is reasonable to postulate
that the capacity to produce  xxxd3234xxx  is restored in all tissues
of the gy-cag/spms mice and that this restoration is related
to the normal survival, fertility, behavior, and growth of
these mice.
transgenic restoration of  xxxg2181xxx  in the gy-cag/
spms synthase mice effectively reversed all of the physical
deficiencies and circling behavior in the gy mice in parallel to
the restoration of tissue  xxxd3234xxx  and a reduction in the excess
spermidine present in these mice. it is interesting that, despite
the presence of  xxxd3234xxx  in the diet and the known existence of
uptake mechanisms for polyamines in mice, tissues from gy
mice contain no  xxxd3234xxx . this may be related to repression of
the transport mechanism by the high level of spermidine in the
gy mice or to a lack of development of the transport system in
these mice. our studies indicate that  xxxg2181xxx  (and
presumably the  xxxd3234xxx  product) is essential for normal development and fertility. the fact that  xxxd3234xxx  was not required for growth of mammalian cells in culture may be related
to the environment and the limited cells tested (23–27). the
striking effect of the availability of  xxxd3234xxx  on the testis,
which is likely to account for the infertility of the gy mice,
provides evidence that this polyamine may be needed in some
specialized cell types. in this context it is noteworthy that: (a)
transgenic mice overexpressing  xxxg1626xxx  show
an age-related decrease in testicular function (39) and that (b)
testicular germ cells express antizyme-3, a novel form of antizyme that regulates polyamine synthesis in a stage-related
manner (40).
the transgenic provision of  xxxg2181xxx  and thus of
 xxxd3234xxx  very effectively reversed the tendency to sudden
death in the gy mice, which is particularly marked in the first
8 weeks of life (fig. 1). although we do not know the exact
cause of this death, a strong possibility is cardiac arrhythmias
caused by dysfunction of potassium channels (41). rectification
of the strong inward rectifier kir channels is known to be

brought about by polyamines (42). although both spermidine
and  xxxd3234xxx  are able to produce such rectification,  xxxd3234xxx 
is more potent, and reduced inward rectification was demonstrated in myocytes from gy mice (43). a neurological role for
 xxxd3234xxx  is indicated by the ability of the  xxxg2181xxx 
transgene to correct the characteristic circling behavior of gy
mice. interactions of  xxxd3234xxx  with ion channels such as the
␣-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid and nmethyl-d-aspartate receptors (15) are a plausible explanation

for these effects. it has also been reported that gy mice have
inner ear deficiencies leading to deafness (31, 32). we did not
investigate these properties, but the gy-cag/spms mice would
be useful for this purpose.
our results show clearly that the elimination of the  xxxg1738xxx 
gene in gy mice is not involved in either the infertility or the
poor survival of these mice. these alterations can be reversed
by the provision of  xxxg2181xxx  activity, but this had no
effect on the loss of phosphate, which is regulated by  xxxg1738xxx . this
finding is consistent with studies in two other mouse strains
where inactivations of  xxxg1738xxx  are known, ska1 (a point mutation) (44) and hyp, which has a deletion that removes part of
the 3⬘ end of the  xxxg1738xxx  and does not extend into spms (45).
although both male and female mice from all three strains
have symptoms of hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia due to
the lack of  xxxg1738xxx , they do not show the other alterations seen in
gy mice including severe growth reduction, infertility, and poor
survival. the reduction in body weight seen in the gy-cag/
spms compared with control or cag/spms mice (fig. 2) is
similar to that seen in hyp mice (32). the much greater differ-

ence in body weight between the gy and the gy-cag/spms
mice provides direct evidence for a requirement for  xxxd3234xxx 
for normal mammalian growth. although this effect on cell
growth could be related to protection from oxidative stress
(46 – 48), another possibility is that  xxxd3234xxx  is needed for the
optimal expression of genes involved in growth. polyamines are
known to regulate both transcription and translation of many
genes (14, 49, 50), and the comparison of gy and gy-cag/spms
mice by gene array analysis and proteomic techniques may be
useful to identify these genes. the use of other transgenic mice
expressing lower levels of  xxxg2181xxx  from tissue-specific promoters may allow the key cell types and level of  xxxd3234xxx  needed for normal mammalian function to be determined.
male gy mice survive only on the b6c3h background, and
the gy deletion could not be transferred to the c57bl/6j strain
(32). hyp mice lacking  xxxg1738xxx  are viable on this strain. the
genetic factors allowing survival in the absence of  xxxd3234xxx  in
b6c3h are unknown. the ability to maintain the gy chromosomal deletion in the gy-cag/spms crosses would allow further study of this question. although the total numbers studied
were small, it is noteworthy that no female gygy mice were
obtained in the offspring of the cross between b6c3h xgy
females and gy-cag/spms male mice. female mice that had
the gygy-cag/spms genotype and male mice that were gy
were present in these offspring. it is therefore possible that
 xxxg2181xxx  deficiency is even more deleterious in females than in males.
recently, it was reported that snyder-robinson syndrome,
an x-linked mental retardation disorder, is caused by a deficiency in  xxxg2181xxx . this deficiency is due to a mutation in a splice site sequence that causes a large reduction but
does not totally abolish enzyme activity. this reduction produces a decrease in  xxxd3234xxx  and a large rise in the spermidine: xxxd3234xxx  ratio (51). in addition to mild-to-moderate
mental retardation, affected males have a variety of other
symptoms including childhood hypotonia, facial asymmetry,
thin habitus, osteoporosis, and kyphoscoliosis. the gy mouse is
clearly not an accurate model for this disorder, and this could
be due to species differences or, more likely, to the complete
absence of  xxxg2181xxx  in the gy mice. however, our
observations that unregulated expression of a  xxxg2181xxx  transgene can reverse the gy phenotype in mice suggest
that attempts to increase  xxxd3234xxx  by dietary manipulations,
drug treatment, or gene therapy may be successful in preventing snyder-robinson syndrome.
