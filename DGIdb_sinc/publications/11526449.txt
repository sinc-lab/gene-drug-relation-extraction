abstract
opioids and  xxxd2738xxx  (no) interact functionally in
different systems. no-generating agents decrease the
activity of opioid agonists, prevent opioid tolerance, and
are used in opioid withdrawal syndromes. there exist,
however, few reports indicating a direct interaction of the
two systems. t47d human breast cancer cells in culture
express opioid receptors, and opioid agonists inhibit their
growth, while they release high amounts of the no-related
molecules no27/no37 to the culture medium. we have
used this system to assay a possible direct interaction of
opiergic and  xxxd2738xxx  systems. our results show that d- or
m-acting opioid agonists do not modify the release of no27/
no37. in contrast, k-acting opioid agonists (ethylketocyclazocine, and as1-casomorphine) decrease the release of
no27/no37, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. the
general opioid antagonist  xxxd1913xxx  (1076 m) produce a
similar no27/no37 release inhibition, indicating a possible
non-opioid-receptor mediated phenomenon. in addition,
ethylketocyclazocine, as1-casomorphin and  xxxd1913xxx 
directly inhibit nos activity: agonists, interact with both
calcium-dependent and independent nos-isoforms, while
the antagonist  xxxd1913xxx  modifies only the activity of
the calcium-dependent fraction of the enzyme. analysis of
this interaction revealed that opioids modify the dimeric
active form of nos, through binding to the reductase part of
the molecule, acting as non-competitive inhibitors of the
enzyme. this interaction opens interesting new possibilities
for tumor biology and breast cancer therapy. cell death and
differentiation (2001) 8, 943 ± 952.

introduction
opioids were found to derive, in all animal species, from three
major propeptides (proenkephalin a and b and  xxxg1801xxx ) and to bind in three major classes of opioid receptors
(d, m and k) (see1 for a recent review). pharmacological
evidences further indicate that multiple subtypes of each
opioid receptor might exist (at least two for the d, two for the m
and three for the k opioid receptor). in addition to the classical
opioid peptides (met5- and  xxxg2329xxx -enkephalin,  xxxg1801xxx ,
dynorphins) a number of opioid peptides, derived from the
limited proteolysis of endogenous or food proteins, were
identified, including casomorphins, derived from a- and bcaseins of animal and human origin (see2 for a review).
recently, we have identified an opioid sequence from as1casein, named alphas1-casomorphin, with a kappa-opioid
receptor activity, which is very potent in inhibiting cell
proliferation of a number of different cancer cell lines, in
vitro.2 ± 5 in addition, a number of synthetic peptide analogs
were reported as selective agonists of delta (dslet), or mu
(dago) opioid receptors. these peptides possess a greater
stability to endo- and exopeptidases found in the receptor
environment.6
 xxxd2738xxx  (no) is a gaseous molecule. it is produced
through the enzymatic deamination of arginin to citrulline,
by the enzyme  xxxd2738xxx  synthase (nos).  xxxd2738xxx 
synthase exists in three different isoforms in mammalian
species: enos, membrane bound,  xxxg1577xxx  bound to different
cellular membrane elements, and the cytosolic inos.
these three isoforms have different molecular masses
(135, 150 and 130 kd respectively) and are products of
different genes.7,8 calcium is necessary for the action of
some forms of the enzyme, although no clear-cut distinction
of the molecular form and calcium-dependency can be
made. during the last decade, no has been recognized as
an important messenger molecule in mammalian species. it
acts through modification of soluble  xxxg1587xxx 
activity9 and cgmp intracellular levels.  xxxd2738xxx  is an
important regulator of different functions, including vasodilation and neurotransmission, although high concentrations of
this agent could be either beneficial (anti-bacterial, antiparasitic or anti-viral) or detrimential, inducing cell death.10
the mechanism of this  xxxd2082xxx  includes a sophisticated
regulation of nucleat transcription factors, and regulation of
a number of intracellular proteins.10 the role of no in
cancer is also contradictory.  xxxd2738xxx  could oxidize
nucleic acids and induce dna damage, although it can

enhance the tumoricidal activity of the immune system. in
addition, no production by tumor cells could enhance the
angiogenetic and metastatic potential of tumors (see11 for a
review).
a functional interaction between opiergic and  xxxd2738xxx 
(no) systems in different organs has been reported so far.
no-related agents inhibit morphine action on testicular
steroidogenesis, while  xxxd2738xxx  synthase inhibitors
reverse the action of opioid antagonists, 12 through
separate intracellular pathways.13 in addition, no or
arginin (a no precursor) decrease the potency of
morphine 14 ± 16 through a modulation of intracellular
concentrations of cgmp, without modifying the characteristics of opioid binding.17,18 no reverts the opioid-exerted
inhibition on lhrh19 ± 21 and gnrh/crh secretion.22 in
contrast, a direct stimulation of no secretion at the cardiac
atrium by morphine was reported,23 while, in the vascular
endothelium, a m-opioid receptor was identified, acting, at
least partially, through a functional coupling with c- and
inos.24 ± 28
no-releasing agents can prevent m receptor-mediated
opioid tolerance but not dependence,16,29 ± 33 and they have
been used experimentally for the treatment of opioid
withdrawal syndromes,34 ± 42 while nos inhibitors enhance
the antinociceptive effects of opioids. 43,44 in opioid
dependence, increased  xxxg1577xxx  immunoreactivity was
found.45 furthermore, after met5-enkephalin application in
rat brain synaptosomes, an increase of membrane fluidity,
no and cgmp production, were observed.46 the activation
of nos-cgmp pathway was proposed as the underlying
mechanism for morphine-induced antinociception,47 ± 49
through two distinct isotypes of  xxxg1577xxx .50 mu-opioid
receptors and  xxxg1577xxx  were co-localized in the rat's nervous
system.51 in the canine gut, nos inhibition decreased or
abolished the action of m- and d-opioid agonists.52 finally,
nociceptin was reported to act through an inhibition of tonic
no secretion.53
previous works have shown that the proliferation of
t47d human breast cancer cells is inhibited, in a dosedependent and reversible manner, by opioid agonists,
through an interaction with d- and k-opioid receptors.2,54 ± 56
in addition, these cells show a very high no27/no37
release, and nos activity, which is not further stimulated by
the addition of mitogens.57 it seemed therefore interesting
to investigate a possible interaction of opioids on no27/
no37 release and nos activity. our results indicate that
opioids can modify the release of no27/no37, and the
enzymatic activity of nos.

figure 1 presents the release of no27/no37 in the culture
medium of t47d cells, reflecting the release of no (see
material and methods). as shown, cells produce and release
high concentrations of no27/no37 (920+19 mmoles/l as

12- xxxd2681xxx , 13-acetate (pma). the addition of 1078 m of
ethylketocyclazocine (ekc), acting on d, m and k opioid
receptors, or the k-opioid agonist a s1 -casomorphine 2
decreased significantly the no27/no37 released in the
culture medium, while the addition of 1078 m dslet or
dago (selective d- and m-opioid agonists respectively) had
no effect, indicating that the action of ekc might be due to its
k-related activity. this opioid effect was equally not modified
by the addition of pma (not shown). the dose-dependence of
the inhibition of no27/no37 release is presented in figure 1,
lower panel (c). as shown, both opioid agonists inhibit the
release of no27/no37 after 24 h incubation in a dose-

dependent manner. at a concentration of 1078 m both opioid
agonists present a maximum effect on no27/no37 release.
therefore, throughout this study, the effect of opioids on noproducing system was assayed at that concentration
(1078 m). interestingly, at this same concentration the
maximum effect of opioid agonists on the arrest of cell
growth was observed.2,56

opioids modify no production
the above decrease of no27/no37 release by opioids
indicates a direct or functional interaction between the opioid
and the no systems. as a first attempt to investigate a
possible direct effect of opioids on no production, we have
assayed the effect of opioid agonists and antagonists on the
kinetics of no production, by flow cytometry. as shown in
figure 2, t47d cells, under basal conditions, produce
significant amounts of no, a result reflected by the high
release of no27/no37 to the culture medium. after 1 h,
about 95% of cells are positive for no. this effect is
decreased (but not abolished) by the addition of the nos
antagonist l-name (no-nitro  xxxd220xxx  methyl ester), in a
concentration-dependent manner (figure 2, lower panel,
insert).
the preincubation of cells with dslet or dago
(specific delta and m opioid agonists respectively) for
10 min to 24 h, did not produce any significant modification
of no production (not shown), confirming the results
presented in figure 1 (absence of effect of d and m opioid
agonists on the concentration of no27/no37 to the culture

medium). in contrast, when cells were incubated with
1078 m ethylketocyclazocine, or as1-casomorphine for the
same time periods (10 min to 24 h), a significant decrease
of no production was observed, varying from 25 to 60% of
total fluorescence. for both opioid agonists this inhibition
was very fast (t1/2 *3 min). in addition, when as1casomorphin was used to inhibit no production, a decline
of its inhibitory effect was observed after 24 h, indicating a
decline of the peptide potency, attributed to its partial
degradation.
 xxxd1913xxx  is a general antagonist of opioid action.
in t47d cells, this compound was found to inhibit the
opioid receptor-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation.56
the incubation of cells with  xxxd1913xxx  alone (1076 m)
decreased the production of no after short (figure 3a) or
long incubation times (figure 3b). the opioid agonist
ekc and the antagonist  xxxd1913xxx  showed similar
kinetic curves applied alone or in combination, indicating
that the observed effect of opioids on the production of
no might not be mediated through membrane opioid
receptors.

opioids inhibit selectively the activity of nos
the above results indicate a direct action of opioids on the
production of no by t47d cells. in order to further analyze this
action, cells were preincubated for 24 h with different opioid
agonists, and total nos activity was assayed in a whole cell
homogenate. the results are presented in figure 4a. as
shown, a significant (by almost 50%) inhibition of nos activity

produce any significant effect, indicating that the effect of
opioids might be restricted to k-acting opioids. preincubation
of cells with diprenorphin (1076 m) produced the same effect
as described for ekc (figure 4b). the incubation of cells with
a combination of ekc (1078 m) and  xxxd1913xxx  (1076 m)
did not have any additional effect on nos activity, confirming
that the observed direct effect of k-opioids might not be
mediated by opioid receptors.
figure 5 presents the substrate-related enzyme velocity
of nos in t47d cells. as shown, increasing concentrations
of arginin increase the enzyme velocity, which reaches a
plateau at concentrations 442 mm (see also table 2).
dslet and dago did not show, as expected, any
significant effect on enzyme velocity. in contrast, ekc
and as1-casomorphine decreased significantly nos activity,
indicating a direct effect of opioids on the enzyme protein.
calculated km and vmax are presented in table 2.
this opioid-related inhibition of nos is dose-dependent.
as shown in figure 6 (upper panel), preincubation of cells

effect of opioids on different isoforms of nos
 xxxd2738xxx  synthase exists in three different isoforms in
mammalian species: enos, membrane bound,  xxxg1577xxx  bound
to different cellular membrane elements, and the cytosolic
inos. these three isoforms have different molecular masses
(135, 150 and 130 kd respectively) and are products of
different genes.7 from another aspect, nos molecules can
be distinguished as calcium-dependent and calcium-independent, although no direct distinction of the three molecular
isoforms could be made upon calcium dependence. figure 7
presents the effect of k-opioids on the activity of these ca2+dependent and independent isoforms of nos. as shown, both
ethylketocyclazocine and as1-casomorphine interact with both
forms of the enzyme (calcium-dependent and independent).
in contrast, the antagonist  xxxd1913xxx  inhibits only the
calcium-dependent nos activity, indicating a differential
action of opioid agonists and antagonists.

effect of fad on opioid-related enzyme inhibition
in the structure of nos proteins two distinct domains can be
identified: the reductase or fad-fmn domain (towards the
carboxylic end of the molecule) and the oxygenase or heme
domain towards its nh2 part.58 an alignment of the three
human types of nos with the human k opioid receptor
revealed that the later fits better with the fad-fmn reductase
domain of nos, indicating a possible binding of opioids at this
part of the molecule. in order to confirm this interaction, we
have performed assays of the enzyme activity, in the
presence or the absence of 1078 m ethylketocyclazocine,

optimal concentration of fad is 1076 m. in contrast, when
ekc is applied, the enzyme activity is decreased by about
40%. increasing the concentration of fad restores the activity
of the enzyme.

discussion
previous investigations have shown a functional interaction
between the opioid system and no in different cell
types.12,14 ± 16,19 ± 22 in addition, no-generating agents have
been used as potential therapeutic drugs in opioid withdrawal
syndromes, and no was found to prevent morphine
tolerance. nevertheless, very few reports indicate a direct
interaction between these two systems,23 ± 26 usually restricted to the modulation of cgmp and/or other signaling
molecules.17,18 the results of the present investigation
indicate that, in t47d breast cancer cells, k- but not d- or mopioid agonists decrease no27/no37 release, by a direct
interaction on nos.
morphine and k-opioid agonists, but not b-endorphin
were found to inhibit  xxxg1577xxx  at the mm range. 59,60
furthermore, d-, m-, or k-opioids inhibit no production in
lps-stimulated macrophages, in a concentration-dependent and reversible manner, indicating a functional coupling

as compared to their corresponding initial value are presented

in the t47d cell line, previous results have shown that
low concentrations of k-opioids decrease cell growth in a
time-, dose-dependent and reversible manner.2,56 we
report here that opioid agonists, active on k-opioid
receptors decrease no27/no37 release to the cell culture
medium (figure 1), and the activity of nos (figures 3a and
6) in a similar dose-dependent manner. in contrast, d- and
m-acting opioid agonists (dslet and dago respectively)
had no effect (figures 1, 4 and 5, tables 1 and 2). the
general opioid antagonist  xxxd1913xxx  exhibits an
inhibitory action on nos too, indicating a non-opioid
receptor-mediated phenomenon (figures 3 and 4). in
addition,  xxxd1913xxx  action is restricted to the calciumdependent fraction of nos, while ethylketocyclazocine and
as1-casomorphine act on both calcium dependent and
independent fractions (figure 7), indicating a differential
action of opioid agonists and antagonists, possibly due to a
different conformation of agonist and antagonist molecules.
previous results indicate that, in the vascular endothelium,
opioid receptors could be coupled to  xxxg1577xxx   xxxg1579xxx ,24 ± 26 although
in this case opioid agonists produce an increase of the
enzyme activity. in our hands, however, no effect of macting opioids (dago) was found, a discrepancy possibly
due to tissue differences in the two studies. indeed, t47d
cells express preferentially k opioid sites, which are
predominant,56 while no m- and rare d-opioid sites have
been identified, with m-opioid agonists acting through
somatostatin receptors.54 preliminary, unpublished, results
from our laboratory indicate that somatostatin analogs
cannot modify nos activity. finally, our results indicate
that the observed opioid action is exerted directly on the
enzyme molecule (figures 3b, 4 and 6).
the mechanism of the direct inhibitory action of opioids
on nos is not clear. our results give some hints on this
interaction: opioids that inhibit directly the enzyme activity

phine) decrease significantly the hill coefficient (see
table 2), indicating a possible dissociation of the nos
dimer, which is considered as the only active form of the
enzyme.7 furthermore, data presented in table 2 indicate
a non-competitive inhibition of enzyme activity.68 the
mechanistics of this type of inhibition indicate that opioids
could bind to free and substrate-bound enzyme molecules, suggesting that they interact with a different site
than that of arginin binding. finally, alignment of the
human k-opioid receptor and the three human nos
sequences indicates that opioid agonists or antagonists
might bind to reductase moiety of the nos molecules, a
result further indicated by the data presented in figure 8,
showing that increasing concentrations of fad restore the
enzymatic activity.
our results show a very rapid inhibitory action of opioids on
no production (figure 2), indicating that, perhaps, a
receptor-mediated interaction could not be ruled out. nevertheless, the fact that agonists and antagonists produce
similar results indicates that, if a receptor-mediated action
occurs, this might be mediated by another membrane
receptor, different from opioid receptors. in addition, if the
direct interaction of opioids on nos molecules reported here,
has a biological significance, opioid ligands might be present
in the cytosol in an active form, after an extracellular
application. a number of reports indicate that, after opioid
treatment, the receptor-ligand complexes enter cells through

early then late endosomes and directed to lysosomes for
degradation of either receptor and/or ligand. this intracellular
trafficking of the receptor-ligand complex occurs minutes
after ligand application, and reaches its maximum after
4 h.69,70 thereafter, if the ligand is applied for short periods
(min) the receptor is redistributed to the plasma membrane,
other ways it is directed to lysosomes for degradation.69 the
fate of opioid ligands is not well established. alkaloids, being
hydrophobic, could enter directly in the cytoplasm. in
contrast, peptide ligands require an active transport through
receptor-mediated endocytosis, and are either degraded, or
they could exert specific intracellular effects. indeed, betaendorphin has been found to interact with intracellular binding
sites, after its extracellular application, indicating internalization in an active form,71 while encephalin analogs were found
to recycle to the culture medium after endocytosis of the
ligand-receptor complex, and lysosomal receptor degradation.72 human k opioid receptors are internalized also rapidly,
with t1/2 of about 10 min, and about 40% of them are found in
the cytoplasm after 20 min exposure to the ligand. 73
interestingly, after agonist removal, receptors could recycle
to the plasma membrane,73 although other reports indicate
that kappa selective peptides induce receptor downregulation.74 a recent report indicates that receptor degradation, involving down regulation, occurs by a combined action
of lysosomes and proteasomes.75 the above results indicate
that receptor and/or ligand internalization is very rapid,
occurring in minutes after receptor-ligand interaction, and
could explain our results, of a very rapid opioid action on nos
activity (figure 2).
the direct interaction of opioids with nos, and the
decrease of the enzyme activity reported here, opens new,
interesting, possibilities for breast tumor biology. no has
been implied to tumor progression and metastasis,11 while
opioids, provided either by the general circulation, or locally
produced, were found to decrease cell growth.2,55,56,76 it is
therefore tentative to relate the reported inhibition of nos
activity and no production and release by opioids to tumor
metastasis suppression, indicating a potential action of
opioids in tumor biology and treatment.

materials and methods
material and cell line
t47d cells were purchased from the european collection of cell
cultures (salisbury, uk). they were cultured in rpmi-1640 medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs), in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% co2 in air. all culture media and sera were from
gibco brl (life technologies, paisley, uk). medium, supplemented
with the different compounds was changed every day.
dago and dslet were from sigma chemical co. (st louis mo,
usa). ekc was a gift from sterling-winthrop (bayer co., leverkusen,
germany).  xxxd1913xxx  was from reckit and coleman co.

 xxxd2738xxx  generation and assay
cells were seeded in 12-well plates, at a density of 200 000 cells/well.
twenty-four hours later, the medium was replaced, and opioids or an

equivalent volume of pbs (negative control) were added. after another
24-h incubation, media were collected, centrifuged and frozen at
7808c, for no27/no37 determination.
no is relatively unstable in the presence of molecular oxygen (o2).
therefore, it is rapidly and spontaneously autooxidized, in aqueous
(physiological) fluids to give the stable nitrite (no27), and (possibly
through the action of certain oxyhemoproteins) nitrate (no37) ions.
we have therefore measured these metabolites, as described by
grisham et al77 and granger et al.78 briefly, 100 ml of the culture
medium were incubated with 0.1 u of nitrate reductase, from
aspergillus, for 30 min at 378c, in 25 ml of 1 m hepes buffer
(ph 7.4), 25 ml of 0.1 mm fad and 50 ml of 1 mm nadph, in a total
volume of 500 ml. this incubation transforms no37 to no 27.
thereafter, 5 ml of lactate dehydrogenase (1500 u/ml) and 50 ml of
100 mm pyruvate were added in each tube, in order to oxidize any
unreacted nadph, which inhibits strongly the griess reaction.
samples were incubated at 378c for 10 min. subsequently, 1 ml of
the griess reagent (equal volumes of 0.2% (w/v) n-(1 naphtyl)ethylenediamine, and 2% (w/v) sulfanilamide in 5% phosphoric acid,
premixed shortly prior to use) was added, followed by 10 min
incubation at room temperature. absorbance was measured at
543 nm, and was linear with standard nitrite concentrations ranging
from 2 ± 60 mm. all reagents used were from sigma (st louis, mo,
usa).
no production by t47d cells was measured using the
diaminofluorescein diacetate method 79,80 and flow cytometry.
briefly, cells, treated or not with opioids for the indicated time
periods, were detached from dishes using a trypsin-edta solution
(gibco brl, life technologies, paisley, uk), adjusted to a
concentration of 106 cells/ml, and diaminofluorescein diacetate
(0.1 mm final concentration in a volume of 10 ml), obtained from
sigma (st louis, mo, usa) was added. no production was assayed
by flow cytometry, using a coulter epics xl-mcl apparatus
(beckman-coulter inc., foullerton, ca, usa), using an excitation
wavelength of 485 nm (20-nm bandwidth) and an emission wavelength
of 530 (25-nm bandwidth). the principle of the methods resides to the
deacetylation of the dye by intracellular esterases to form
diaminofluorescin (daf), which, in turn, is transformed to the
fluorescent dye 2', 7'-diaminofluorescein under the action of no.
this dye remains trapped in the cell and can therefore be measured by
flow cytometry. it was reported that daf, in neutral solutions as the
cellular environment, does not react with other oxidized forms of no,
such as no2 and no3, or other reactive nitrogen or oxygen species.80
nevertheless, in order to confirm these results, and to rule out other
possible sources of fluorescence, we have considered as no-related
specific fluorescence the difference of the total fluorescent signal and
that obtained in the presence 1 mm of the nos inhibitor l-name. in
addition, we have used as a blank in all our measurements a mixture of
daf (0.1 mm) and opioids (1078 m), in the absence of cells.

 xxxd2738xxx  synthase assay
 xxxd2738xxx  synthase (nos) activity was assayed, by the transformation of radioactive arginine to citrulline.81,82 briefly, cells were
detached from dishes by thrypsin-edta, washed with phosphatebuffered saline (pbs), harvested in pbs-1 mm edta, and
homogenized with repeated pipetting with 250 ml homogenization
buffer (250 mm tris-edta, 10 mm edta, 10 mm egta). nuclei and
unbroken cells were separated by centrifugation at 12 0006g for
15 min, and discarded, while the supernatant was used for the assay
of nos. the concentration of proteins was adjusted  xxxd1891xxx  mg/ml. a
reaction mixture (sufficient for 10 data points) is prepared, with 250 ml

of 50 mm tris -hcl ph 7.4 containing 6 mm tetrahydrobiopterin, 2 mm
 xxxd2112xxx  and 2 mm flavin adenine mononucleotide,
50 ml of 10 mm nadph, 10 ml [3h] arginine (amersham, buckinghamshire, uk), 50 ml of 6 mm cacl2 and 40 ml distilled water. fourty ml of
this reaction mixture were mixed with 10 ml of the protein extract and
incubated for 1 h at 378c. during this incubation time [3h]-arginine is
converted by nos to [3h]-citrulline. the reaction was stopped with
400 ml of ice-cold 50 mm hepes (ph 5.5)-5 mm edta. non-reacted
arginine was eliminated by resin absorption (ag 50wx*, biorad
laboratories, hercules, ca, usa). the eluate was mixed with
scintillation fluid (sigmafluor, sigma, st louis, mo, usa) and the
radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (tricarb,
packard, instrument co., meriden, ct, usa), with 60% efficiency for
tritium. for the detection of calcium-independent nos isoforms, cacl2
was replaced by water. in order to assay the effect of fad on the
enzyme activity, different concentrations of fad, ranging from 1077 ±
1074 m, were introduced in the reaction mixture, in the presence or
the absence of 1078 m ekc.

calculations
all calculations were performed using the origin v 5.0 microcomputer
program (northampton, ma, usa). statistical analysis (anova,
student's t-test), were made by the use of systat v 9.0 (spss
science, chicago il, usa) microcomputer program.
