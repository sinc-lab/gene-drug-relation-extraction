 xxxd1722xxx , a next-generation deoxyadenosine analogue, was developed on the basis of experience with
cladribine and ﬂudarabine in order to achieve higher efﬁcacy and avoid extramedullary toxicity. during
the past decade this is the only drug granted approval for treatment of pediatric acute leukemia. recent
clinical studies have established the efﬁcacy of  xxxd1722xxx  in treating malignancies with a poor
prognosis, such as adult, elderly, and relapsed pediatric leukemia. the mechanisms of its anti-cancer
activity involve a combination of direct inhibition of dna synthesis and ribonucleotide reductase and
induction of apoptosis. due to this broad cytotoxicity, this drug is effective against various subtypes of
leukemia and is currently being tested as an oral formulation and for combination therapy of both
leukemias and solid tumors. in this review we summarize current knowledge pertaining to the
molecular mechanisms of action and pharmacological properties of  xxxd1722xxx , as well as clinical
experiences with this drug with the purpose of facilitating the evaluation of its efﬁcacy and the
development of future therapies.

1. introduction
nucleoside analogues have had a substantial impact on the
treatment of cancer, especially hematological malignancies. the
most credible explanation is the dependency of hematopoietic
cells on salvage synthesis of nucleosides [1] and their expression of
several membrane transporters that take up nucleoside analogues
[2]. their structural similarity to physiological nucleosides allows
these analogues to be taken up by cells, metabolized, and
incorporated into dna or rna. therefore, the main targets of

these activated nucleoside analogues are the enzymes involved in
de novo and salvage pathways of nucleoside synthesis.
the history of nucleoside analogues dates back to the late 1950s
when  xxxd1790xxx  ( xxxd1790xxx , arac) was synthesized and
subsequently became the backbone in the treatment of acute
myeloid leukemia (aml) and one of the most widely used
nucleoside analogues to date [3]. single-dose treatment with arac
was not promising, but in combination with agents that interacted
with topoisomerase, such as anthracyclines, a high rate of
remission could be achieved in aml patients [4]. the success of
arac led to the development of other arabinosylpurine homologues (e.g. 9-b-d-arabinofuranosyladenine (araa)). since the
clinical activity of araa was found to be limited due to its rapid
deamination by  xxxg62xxx  (ada) [5], ada-resistant
halogenated arabinosyl derivatives such as 2-ﬂuoro-9-b-arabinofuranosyladenine (ﬂudarabine) were then developed [6]. thereafter, because of the insolubility of ﬂudarabine, its 50 monophosphate derivative (ﬂudarabine monophosphate,  xxxd2120xxx ,
fludara1), was designed for conversion into ﬂudarabine by
endogenous phosphatases. however, treatment with this latter
drug also results in the formation, by phosphorylase cleavage, of 2ﬂuoroadenine, a toxic compound with only minor anti-tumor
activity [7]. in the early 1970s the realization that halogenated
analogues exert an anti-leukemic effect led to the synthesis of 2chlordeoxyadenosine (cladribine, cda) [8], which, however, has
reduced oral bioavailability due in part to its instability in the

acidic gastric environment as well as its susceptiblity to enzymatic
cleavage [9–11].
in the 1990s, in order to tackle all the above-mentioned
limitations of early nucleoside analogues, a next-generation
deoxyadenosine analogue,  xxxd1722xxx  (2-chloro-20 -arabinoﬂuoro-20 -deoxyadenosine,  xxxd1722xxx , cl- xxxd2120xxx ), a 20 -arabino-ﬂuoro
derivative of cladribine, was synthesized [12]. the rationale behind
its design was to combine the structural features of cladribine and
ﬂudarabine (fig. 1). like cladribine and ﬂudarabine,  xxxd1722xxx  is
toxic to both non-proliferating human lymphocytes and rapidly
proliferating cells, while being resistant to phosphorylitic cleavage
and deamination-stable in acidic environments.
preclinical studies indicated a high degree of efﬁcacy of
 xxxd1722xxx  and subsequently led to human trials. in 2004 the
fda approved  xxxd1722xxx  (clolartm, genzyme) for the treatment of
pediatric leukemic patients – a decision followed by european
commision approval in 2006 (evoltra1, bioenvision). today the
anti-cancer activity of  xxxd1722xxx  toward other types of tumors, as
well as in other age groups, is being actively investigated.
2. molecular mechanisms of action
2.1. structure and physicochemical properties
 xxxd1722xxx  was designed as an adenosine analogue with
improved stability both in the plasma and the acidic gastric
environment. and, indeed, the introduction of a ﬂuorine atom at
the 20 -arabino position of cladribine increases its stability at ph 1.0
[13]. as predicted, the pka value of  xxxd1722xxx  (1.75) is higher than
that of cladribine (1.28). furthermore, it exhibits the highest
lipophilicity among related purine analogues [13] and is resistant
to degradation by e. coli  xxxg1792xxx  [14].
2.2. transport and metabolism
 xxxd1722xxx  metabolites are retained by cells to a greater extent
than metabolites of cladribine, which is believed to be one factor in
the more pronounced anti-tumoral effect and higher hematological toxicity of the former [15]. other factors contributing to its
higher anti-cancer activity are thought to be  xxxd1722xxx ’s high
afﬁnity for nucleoside transporters and  xxxg611xxx 
( xxxg611xxx ), as well as for key enzymes involved in dna synthesis, e.g.
ribonucleotide reductase (rr) and dna polymerase-a and -e.
most cells have two types of active nucleoside transporters:
human equilibrative nucleoside transporter (hent) and human
concentrative nucleoside transporter (hcnt). transport via hents
is a sodium-independent mechanism involving primarily bidirectional facilitative diffusion driven by a gradient in the

nucleoside concentration across the cell membrane. in contrast,
the hcnts are sodium-dependent active transporters that depend
on atp for their ability to transport purine nucleosides into the cell
against a concentration gradient.
 xxxd1722xxx  is believed to enter cells by both facilitated and active
nucleoside transport mechanisms as well as, at higher concentrations and upon longer exposure, by passive diffusion across lipid
membranes [16]. the importance of membrane nucleoside transporters in  xxxd1722xxx  metabolism is indicated by the fact that the
rate of  xxxd1722xxx  uptake is 10-fold higher by transportcompetent than transport-deﬁcient human leukemia cells [16]. in
particular, cells expressing hcnt3 exhibit the highest rate of
 xxxd1722xxx  uptake compared to the cells expressing  xxxg2130xxx , hent1,
and hent2, whereas transport-deﬁcient and  xxxg2129xxx -expressing cells
demonstrate no uptake, consistent with the fact that  xxxg2129xxx  is
speciﬁc for pyrimidines. in addition,  xxxd1722xxx  was more cytotoxic
to cells expressing hent1 than ﬂudarabine or cladribine.
upon entry into cells,  xxxd1722xxx  is phosphorylated to its
monophosphate derivatives, primarily by  xxxg611xxx , a constitutively
expressed key cytosolic enzyme involved in the salvage pathway of
dna synthesis, but also by the mitochondrial enzyme deoxyguanosine kinase (dgk) [17]. further intracellular phosphorylation
results in the ﬁnal metabolite,  xxxd1722xxx  triphosphate. the
cytotoxicity of nucleoside analogues in quiescent cells (i.e.
lymphocytes) depends mainly upon selective and progressive
accumulation of the triphosphate metabolites because of the high
ratio of  xxxg611xxx  to cytosolic 50 -nucleotidase. the latter acts as a
deactivator of nucleoside analogues by dephosphorylating the
triphosphate metabolites and enabling their transport out of the
cell. the importance of  xxxg611xxx  for the efﬁcacy of  xxxd1722xxx  was
conﬁrmed by our recent ﬁnding that the cells deﬁcient in this
activity are more resistant to the cytotoxic effect of this drug [18].
furthermore, the concentration of  xxxg611xxx  is typically highest in
lymphoid tissues, as well as considerably higher in tumor tissues
than in normal tissues [19]. the studies with recombinant human
 xxxg611xxx  and kinases in the crude leukemic cell extracts have revealed
that the efﬁciency (vmax/km) of  xxxd1722xxx  phosphorylation by
these enzymes is close to, or greater than, that of the natural
substrate  xxxd1836xxx , as well as signiﬁcantly greater than that
of cladribine or ﬂudarabine [20,21]. the interactions between 2-cl
and its surrounding hydrophobic residues contribute to the high
catalytic efﬁciency of  xxxg611xxx  for  xxxd1722xxx  [22].
although  xxxg611xxx  activity is rate-limiting for the accumulation of
ﬂudarabine triphosphates, this is not the case with  xxxd1722xxx 
[15]. accumulation of  xxxd1722xxx  appears to be determined by the
rate of phosphorylation of its monophosphate to diphosphate by
purine nucleotide monophosphate kinase, similarly to cladribine
[15,23]. one explanation might be that nucleoside analogues

a. zhenchuk et al. / biochemical pharmacology 78 (2009) 1351–1359

bearing a 2-chloroadenine nucleobase are relatively poor substrates for the monophosphate kinase.
2.3. mechanisms of anti-cancer activity
the anti-cancer activity of  xxxd1722xxx  involves three major
mechanisms: inhibition of dna synthesis, inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase, and direct induction of apoptosis (fig. 2). this
broad range of activities explains the efﬁcacy of the drug against
both rapidly growing and quiescent tumors [14].
 xxxd1722xxx  competes potently with  xxxd1148xxx  for binding to dna
polymerase-a and -e [24]. at a low ratio of  xxxd1722xxx  triphosphate to  xxxd1148xxx ,  xxxd1722xxx  is incorporated primarily into internal
phosphodiester linkages inhibiting dna repair; whereas, at higher
ratios,  xxxd1722xxx  is detected mainly at terminal sites inhibiting
dna elongation [15]. the most pronounced inhibition of dna
elongation is observed at  xxxd1722xxx  triphosphate to  xxxd1148xxx  ratios
greater than one [25]. incorporation of  xxxd1722xxx  monophosphate
into dna impairs its elongation and repair by causing chain
termination and strand breaks. however,  xxxd1722xxx  triphosphate

1353

is not a potent inhibitor of dna polymerase-b, mitochondrial dna
polymerase-g, or dna primase [24].
in a recent article chen et al. suggested that  xxxd1722xxx  action
may as well involve an rna-directed mechanism.  xxxd1722xxx 
triphosphates were shown to cause chain termination in the
absence of atp [26]. with increasing amounts of  xxxd1722xxx 
triphosphates, there was a concentration-dependent effect on
polyadenylation due to blockage of the ability of yeast poly(a)polymerase (ypap) to extend the poly(a)-tail by the analogues’
incorporation into rna [26].
besides dna polymerase inhibition,  xxxd1722xxx  triphosphate
potently inhibits rr activity (50% at 65 nm) [24] by binding to the
allosteric site on the regulatory subunit, incorporating in this
manner anti-cancer properties of ﬂudarabine. inhibition of rr
depletes the dntp pool, with the most pronounced reduction in the
dctp pool, followed by  xxxd1148xxx  and  xxxd1837xxx , and only a minor effect on
the dttp pool. through depletion of the dntp pool,  xxxd1722xxx 
self-potentiates the incorporation of  xxxd1722xxx  triphosphates into
dna, thus explaining the increased effectiveness of  xxxd1722xxx  in
dna synthesis inhibition [27].

fig. 2.  xxxd1722xxx ’s mechanism of action.  xxxd1722xxx  is transported into the cell by either passive diffusion or facilitated/active transport by concentrative and equilibrative
nucleoside transporters (ents and cnts); in addition, there is some evidence of mitochondrial transport [16]. upon entering the cell,  xxxd1722xxx  is phosphorylated stepwise
by  xxxg611xxx  ( xxxg611xxx ), monophosphate kinase (mpkinase), and diphosphate kinase (dpkinase) to its triphosphate active form (clofarabinetp). clofarabinetp acts as
an inhibitor of dna polymerase-a (dna pol a) and -e (dna pol e) by competing with the natural substrate  xxxd1148xxx . when incorporated into dna  xxxd1722xxx  leads to dna
damage, which signals activation of apoptotic pathways. it can further inhibit ribonucleotide reductase (rr), causing dntp pool reduction and thus reinforcing its own
incorporation into dna. by directly affecting the mitochondrial transmembrane potential,  xxxd1722xxx  releases  xxxg569xxx  and apoptosis-inducing factor (aif) [30]. in
addition, it binds cytosolic  xxxg169xxx  ( xxxg169xxx ) and thus mediates caspase activation [30]. consequently, caspase-9, together with other proapoptotic factors, forms apoptosome, leading to cell apoptosis. moreover,  xxxd1722xxx  may mediate pro-apoptotic signals by inducing down-regulation the death suppressor
proteins  xxxg251xxx (l) and  xxxg1388xxx  and dephosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic kinase akt [31].

1354

a. zhenchuk et al. / biochemical pharmacology 78 (2009) 1351–1359

furthermore, depletion of dntp pools can lead to enhanced
nucleoside kinase activity and thereby increased phosphorylation
of nucleoside analogues, more pronounced accumulation and
prolonged retention of the triphosphate metabolites, and, consequently, a more potent anti-cancer effect [25]. the damage caused
by incorporation of  xxxd1722xxx  monophosphate into dna initiates
a chain of events that result in activation of pro-apoptotic
pathways.  xxxd1722xxx  can replace  xxxd1148xxx  and directly affects
cytosolic  xxxg169xxx  ( xxxg169xxx ), thus
causing caspase activation [28,29].  xxxd1722xxx  also directly affects
mitochondria by altering the transmembrane potential and, as a
result, releasing  xxxg569xxx  and apoptosis-inducing factor (aif)
[30]. mitochondrial damage caused by  xxxd1722xxx  may be
explained by direct binding of the triphosphate metabolite to
proteins in the mitochondrial membrane, leading to an alteration
in membrane potential as well as intra-mitochondrial accumulation of this triphosphate [30]. the combined actions of cytochrome
c, aif,  xxxg169xxx , and caspase-9 lead to the formation of the
apoptosome complex responsible for programmed cell death
induction.
moreover,  xxxd1722xxx  has been shown to induce dose- and
time-dependent down-regulation of the death suppressor proteins
 xxxg251xxx (l) and  xxxg1388xxx  and dephosphorylation of anti-apoptotic kinase
akt and its downstream effectors (bad, fkhrl1) [31]. an
interesting observation was made in the t-all cem cell line
when treated with  xxxd1722xxx  and caffeine [31]. the addition of
caffeine inhibited the down-regulation of cdc25a, usually
observed when cells are treated with  xxxd1722xxx  alone, and
increased the cleavage of parp. therefore, a combinatorial effect
on apoptosis could be expected if  xxxd1722xxx  is administered
together with inhibitors of  xxxg442xxx , a checkpoint homologue that
phosphorylates cdc25 and prevents cells entering mitosis.
2.4. mechanism of resistance
the effectiveness of nucleoside analogue treatment against
cancer cells is principally limited by the primary or acquired drug
resistance. this commonly happens due to alteration in the activity
of one or more actors in the metabolic pathway of a drug, thus
leading to its reduced effectiveness. a detailed knowledge of the
molecular mechanisms underlying such resistance would enable
the use of appropriate dosing schedules and combination therapies
in the clinical setting to overcome this limitation.
there are few studies that have initiated the investigations into
potential mechanisms of resistance. in one such study, the
resistance to  xxxd1722xxx  acquired by hl-60 and ccrf-cem cell
lines is directly correlated with reduced activity of the nucleoside
phosphorylating enzyme  xxxg611xxx , as has been previously found to be
the case with cladribine [20,32]. we detected  xxxg611xxx  deﬁciency at the
level of enzymatic activity, the protein level, and also as mrna
expression for the cell lines resistant to  xxxd1722xxx ; these cells did
not consistently form detectable levels of  xxxd1722xxx  triphosphates. however, no mutations in the coding region of the  xxxg611xxx 
gene were detected. the suggestion that dna methylation is
responsible for the decreased level of  xxxg611xxx  in resistant cancer cells
has not been conﬁrmed [32,33].
the problem of resistance due to reduced  xxxg611xxx  and/or dgk
activity might be overcome by introducing the drug as a pronucleotide, thereby releasing the deoxynucleoside 50 -monophosphate directly into the cell. in addition, determination of  xxxg611xxx  and/
or dgk activities might help predict how well a patient will
respond to a certain cytotoxic drug and which dose and
combination of drugs will be most effective.
 xxxd1722xxx -resistant cell lines showed cross-resistance to
other antimetabolites (i.e. ﬂudarabine, arac, diﬂuorodeoxycytidine,  xxxd2188xxx ) phosphorylated by  xxxg611xxx  [20,32]. thus,  xxxd1722xxx -

resistant cells also accumulate lower levels of cladribine and other
analogue nucleotides. on the other hand, cells resistant to
ﬂudarabine exhibited cross-resistance to cladribine, but not
 xxxd1722xxx .
no alteration in nucleoside transport or expression of the
classical mdr (multidrug-resistance) protein was detected in
 xxxd1722xxx -resistant cells, suggesting that the mechanism of
acquired resistance to  xxxd1722xxx  is a speciﬁc, rather than a
general, phenomenon [20,32].  xxxd1722xxx -resistant cells also
exhibit the highest number of structurally rearranged chromosomes, indicating a high potential of  xxxd1722xxx  to rearrange the
genome [32]. however, this was not the cause of  xxxg611xxx  deﬁciency.
expression of a small subunit of rr (r2) was substantially
reduced and the enzyme’s activity was halved with no alteration of
allosteric activity in the  xxxd1722xxx -resistant cell lines, as opposed
to ﬂudarabine-resistant cell lines, where rr was substantially
higher than in the wild type cell line [32]. since the resistant cell
line with inhibited  xxxg611xxx  and rr activity still produced dntps and
kept on proliferating, it was hypothesized that  xxxg1993xxx , a small
subunit of rr directly induced by p53, replaces r2 to form active
ribonucleotide reductase. a truncated form of  xxxg1993xxx  was detected
that may replace r2 in the production of dntps in the resistant cell
lines.
other mechanisms of resistance to  xxxd1722xxx  are thought to
involve changes in ca2+-sensitive mitochondrial phenomena and
are probably not inﬂuenced by the fas pathway, as in the case of
cladribine [34].
3. pharmacokinetics and anti-cancer activity
3.1. in vitro investigations
as expected from its potent inhibition of dna synthesis,
 xxxd1722xxx  exerts potent growth inhibition and cytotoxic activity
(ic50 values = 0.028–0.29 mm) in a wide variety of leukemia and
solid tumor cell lines in vitro [35]. thus, of 60 human tumor cell
lines in the national cancer institute’s developmental therapeutics program panel,  xxxd1722xxx  potently inhibits the growth (gi50
values = <0.0001–0.45 mm) of 35. the cell types sensitive to
 xxxd1722xxx  include those of non-small-cell lung, colon, central
nervous system, melanoma, ovarian, renal, prostate, and breast
tumors [36].
cariveau et al. also demonstrated that  xxxd1722xxx  exhibits a
strong radiosensitizing effect on murine tissues in vitro and in vivo,
by interfering with the repair of dna damage [37]. another
mechanism driving the radiosensitization activity of a combination of  xxxd1722xxx  with ionizing radiation (ir) was found to be the
activation of  xxxg611xxx  by ir, which consequently enhances  xxxd1722xxx 
cytotoxicity [38].
in vitro exposure of mononuclear cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) and aml patients to identical concentrations
of  xxxd1722xxx  and cladribine leads to higher intracellular
accumulation of the former’s triphosphate metabolites [20,39].
in these cells, the major metabolite detected was  xxxd1722xxx 
monophosphate, with  xxxd1722xxx  diphosphate representing less
than 10% of the total nucleotide metabolite present, thereby
conﬁrming that  xxxg611xxx  is not the rate-limiting step for the formation
of  xxxd1722xxx  triphosphate. interestingly, no correlation was found
between the level of phosphorylated metabolites, enzymes ( xxxg611xxx ,
dgk), and the cytotoxicity of  xxxd1722xxx , suggesting that additional factors determine its cytotoxic activity [39].
in isolated perfused rat liver,  xxxd1722xxx  and cladribine have a
similar ﬁrst-pass metabolism of 50% [40]. the rate of elimination of
both of these substances is strongly dependent on the initial
concentrations. however, the elimination rate of  xxxd1722xxx  is
much slower and its concentration declines without an increase in

a. zhenchuk et al. / biochemical pharmacology 78 (2009) 1351–1359

the concentration of the degradation product, 2-chloroadenine,
most likely due to the binding of  xxxd1722xxx  to components of
hepatic tissue. the elimination kinetics of  xxxd1722xxx  50 -mono-, di, and triphosphate exhibit tri-phasic behavior, with a b-half-life of
8–24 h and a very long g-half-life (29 h), indicating prolonged
cellular retention [15].
in a study on polarized human kidney proximal tubule cells
(hrptc11), apical-to-basolateral ﬂuxes of  xxxd1722xxx  as well as
ﬂudarabine and cladribine across the cell layer were observed
following mediation by the coupling of apical hcnt3 to basolateral
hent2 [41]. such directionality of transepithelial ﬂuxes of these
three nucleoside analogues resembles that of adenosine, which is
reabsorbed in human kidney proximal tubules. these observations
could explain the delayed elimination of  xxxd1722xxx . a deeper
insight into the mechanisms of hnts transport of  xxxd1722xxx  could
lead to strategies aimed at improving its dosing with maximum
efﬁcacies and minimum toxicity.
the major metabolite detected in rat and dog hepatocytes after
exposure to  xxxd1722xxx  is p11, which accounts for 1.2% and 2.5%,
respectively, of the total radioactivity recovered [42]. p11 is
suggested to be a carboxy- or methoxy- xxxd1722xxx , but the exact
location of the change remains unknown. the only metabolite
observed in the case of human hepatocytes is p14, which accounts
for 0.2% of the total radioactivity recovered and has been suggested
to be the sulfates’ conjugate of  xxxd1722xxx  at the 50 -carbon.
the in vitro efﬁcacy of  xxxd1722xxx  was compared to those of
 xxxd2707xxx  and arac in a panel of acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(all) cells [43]. the concentration of  xxxd1722xxx  that inhibits
growth by 50% is 188 times lower than the corresponding
concentration for  xxxd2707xxx  in all cases.  xxxd1722xxx  appears to
be marginally more effective in b-lineage than in t-lineage all and
b-lineage is also several times more sensitive to  xxxd1722xxx  than
arac. there is a potential for cross-resistance of  xxxd1722xxx  to
many all therapeutics, but not methotrexate or thiopurines. this
distinct resistance proﬁle may prove useful in combination with
other compounds.
one such combination study was undertaken with alkylating
agents and  xxxd1722xxx  or ﬂudarabine in lymphocytes isolated from
cll patients [44]. dna damage repair mechanisms were ﬁrst
initiated in the cll lymphocytes by treatment with 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide. this dna repair was then inhibited by dna
chain termination in an equivalent manner by treatment with
either ﬂudarabine or  xxxd1722xxx . however,  xxxd1722xxx  triphosphates exhibited increased rates of intracellular accumulation,
thus leading to maximal inhibition at 1/10 the concentration of
ﬂudarabine triphosphates.
exposure to such agents as cladribine,  xxxd1722xxx , ﬂudarabine,
or arac leads to a 2–4-fold increase in  xxxg611xxx  activity (most probably
by direct inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase) in the hl-60 cell
line, as well as in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [45]. this
phenomenon has been exploited by treating cells with one
deoxynucleoside analogue initially in order to induce  xxxg611xxx  activity
and thereafter administering a second analogue; and, as expected,
 xxxd1722xxx  pretreatment to induce  xxxg611xxx  enhances subsequent
accumulation of arac triphosphate in myeloid cell lines [46].
similarly, pretreatment of hct-116 colon, k562 leukemia, and rl
lymphoma cell lines with  xxxd1722xxx  enhanced the metabolism of
t-arac (1-b-d: -[4-thio-arabinofuranosyl] cytosine), a new cytosine analogue with superior anti-cancer activity as compared to
arac [47].
caution must be observed, however, when combining arac
with  xxxd1722xxx  since these compounds have been shown to have
cross-resistance [48]. alternatively,  xxxd3485xxx  (vpa), a histone
deacetylase inhibitor used as a drug against epilepsy, exhibits a
synergistic effect when combined with  xxxd1722xxx  in aml cell
lines and primary cells. a possible explanation could be that vpa

1355

induces apoptosis by activating both extrinsic and intrinsic
apoptotic pathways.
a recent study demonstrated the hypomethylation property of
 xxxd1722xxx  in human lymphoid tumor cells as well as its ability to
up-regulate the expression of cancer-testis (ct) antigens (sp17 and
span-xb) aberrantly expressed in tumor cells [49]. if the same
property is proven to be effective in vivo, it could be possible to
administer low-dose  xxxd1722xxx  to patients to up-regulate the
expression of ct antigens to increase the susceptibility of the tumor
cells to the cytotoxic effect of antigen-speciﬁc cytotoxic t cells prior
to administering speciﬁc tumor vaccines targeting ct antigens by
hypomethylating. furthermore, hypomethylating dna  xxxd1722xxx 
at low doses could potentially enhance the expression of tumor
suppressor genes that are often hypermethylated, and thus inhibited,
in cancer cells, leading to activation of pro-apoptotic genes.
silencing of 50 -nucleotidase  xxxg2129xxx  by sirna interference in a
panel of leukemic cell lines has signiﬁcantly augmented the
cytotoxicity of  xxxd1722xxx . this investigation could prove the
combination of  xxxd1722xxx  nucleotidases inhibitors useful for
cancer treatment [50].
3.2. in vivo investigations
in addition to numerous studies on the effects of  xxxd1722xxx  in
cells, a considerable amount of in vivo data on various animal
models is available.
the dose and schedule-dependent cancer activity of  xxxd1722xxx 
was demonstrated by testing different dosing schedules in an nci
h460 lung tumor murine model with the greatest anti-tumor
activity seen when the daily  xxxd1722xxx  dose was subdivided into
three equal doses and administered at 4-h intervals each day for 30
days [36,51].
since nucleoside transporters are expressed in many tissues,
 xxxd1722xxx  is expected to be widely distributed in both tumor and
normal tissues. indeed, this has been found to be the case in mice
and rats, where the tissue distribution is rapid and widespread
with the highest concentrations occurring in highly perfused
organs [42,52].
the tissue-to-plasma ratios of  xxxd1722xxx  in the liver and
myocardium were considerably high (4.8 and upward) [42]. this is
most probably due to the fact that the active  xxxd1722xxx 
phosphates must be dephosphorylated in order to be exported
from the cell as well as to the lipophilicity of the parent drug. these
observations are consistent with pharmacokinetic studies which
reveal that, following intravenous administration,  xxxd1722xxx  is
extensively distributed throughout the body, with a volume of
distribution at steady state (vdss) of approximately 1.4–2.6 l/kg in
mice, 3.2–3.6 l/kg in rats, and 0.9–1.2 l/kg in dogs [36].
intravenous administration of [14c] xxxd1722xxx  25 mg/kg/day to
rats conﬁrmed the non-linear pharmacokinetics, showing three
exponential phases of elimination, with half-lives of 0.3, 1.3, and
12.8 h [42]. close to 80% of the dose administered was recovered in
the urine and 10% in the feces. the major metabolite, 6ketoclofarabine, is believed to be formed extrahepatically via
 xxxg62xxx .
the fact that  xxxd1722xxx  is more stable in an acidic environment
and more lipophilic than cladribine [13,40] leads to the assumption that the former would have more side effects, particularly
neurotoxicity. however, in mice, the accumulation of  xxxd1722xxx 
in brain tissue was found to be lower than that of cladribine [52],
contradicting the assumption that  xxxd1722xxx ’s more pronounced
lipophilicity would render it a more effective drug for the
treatment of lymphoproliferative disorders in the central nervous
system (cns).
on the other hand, in a study of non-human primates,
 xxxd1722xxx  was found to penetrate into the cerebrospinal ﬂuid,

1356

a. zhenchuk et al. / biochemical pharmacology 78 (2009) 1351–1359

although to a modest extent [53]. the concentrations obtained
there may nevertheless approach those known to be cytotoxic in
vitro.
a substantial anti-cancer effect has been observed against
human colon tumors transplanted into nude mice, exhibiting
schedule-dependent anti-tumor activity upon intraperitoneal,
intravenous or, particularly, oral administration of  xxxd1722xxx 
[54]. fifty percent of tumor growth was inhibited at 0.26 mm in a
72-h exposure, a concentration signiﬁcantly lower than that of
ﬂudarabine and cladribine. the most effective of three administration regimens tested (single, twice-weekly, 5-day once daily)
was a 5-day daily administration schedule.
administration of oral doses in rats equivalent to intravenous
doses of 10 and 25 mg/kg provides bioavailability estimates of
approximately 50%, indicating the feasibility of oral treatment [55].
approximately 83% of  xxxd1722xxx  was recovered in plasma with
only 13.3% binding to plasma proteins.
orally administered  xxxd1722xxx  again showed superior antitumor activity with regressive or cytostatic growth curves
compared to intraperitoneally administered  xxxd1722xxx  in an
ht29 colon tumor mouse model [56]. additionally, in an rl
lymphoma tumor mouse model, prolonged administration (21
days) of oral  xxxd1722xxx  showed markedly enhanced anti-tumor
activity as compared to intravenous administration on a daily 5
days schedule, the dosing regimen commonly used in clinical trials
[57].
the hematological toxicity effects of  xxxd1722xxx  in fischer 344
rats were least severe, in terms of effects on the circulating white
blood cell count (wbc), when administered in daily oral doses of
36 and 60 mg/m2 for 21 days than in doses of 150 and 240 mg/m2
administered orally or intravenously daily for 5 days. intravenously dosed rats also exhibited decreased cellularity in the bone
marrow [57].
in an attempt to further improve the pharmacological and
toxicological properties of  xxxd1722xxx , heckl-östreicher et al. have
synthesized an epd- xxxd1722xxx  prodrug, which is activated by
membrane-associated speciﬁc hydrolases releasing the free
nucleoside into the respective cells [58]. in a comparative
pharmacokinetic study, a prodrug revealed a 36 times higher
plasma exposure and an increased terminal half-life but very low
free  xxxd1722xxx  concentrations. epd- xxxd1722xxx  showed high
efﬁcacy in a variety of solid tumor xenograft models, demonstrating improved tolerability and increased and sustained antitumoral growth inhibition compared to  xxxd1722xxx . furthermore,
this compound could be a potential candidate for the treatment of
pancreatic cancer as monotherapy or in combination with
gemcitabine as well as in the gemcitabine-resistant form of
pancreatic cancer [59].
in summary, the in vivo studies demonstrated  xxxd1722xxx  to be
an effective drug with a substantial anti-cancer effect and superior
oral bioavailability, as well as a very promising candidate for
combination therapies, thus successfully highlighting its potential
in human studies.
3.3. pharmacokinetic data in humans
the initial studies in humans have corroborated the potent
nature of  xxxd1722xxx  as an anti-cancer agent observed in animal
studies. a consistent decline has been observed (68–99%) in the
wbc count in all acute leukemia patients treated with 40 mg/m2 of
 xxxd1722xxx  after 5 days, indicating its high potency [60].
dna synthesis is inhibited by 75–95% at the end of an infusion
of  xxxd1722xxx  at doses ranging from 22.5 to 55 mg/m2. in the lower
dose (22.5 and 30 mg/m2) range a partial recovery of the inhibition
of dna synthesis was observed after 24 h, while at the higher doses
(40 and 55 mg/m2) this inhibition remained unchanged. this

implies that there is a dose-dependent effect on the maintenance
of inhibition of dna synthesis by  xxxd1722xxx  treatment [60].
speciﬁcally, the decrease in dna synthesis was shown to be
associated with the accumulation of  xxxd1722xxx  triphosphates in
the blasts of adults with refractory leukemias [60,61].
bonate and coworkers have analyzed pharmacokinetic data
from one phase i [62] and two phase ii studies [63]. weight and
wbc count were the only patient-speciﬁc factors identiﬁed as
being important for the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1722xxx  [64].
however, in a study conducted by the genzyme corporation in
adults with advanced solid refractory tumors, neither  xxxd1722xxx 
clearance nor  xxxd1722xxx  central volume correlated with weight or
body surface area [56].
 xxxd1722xxx  demonstrated a b-half-life of 6.4 h and a vdss of
210 l (72% between-subject variability) in a 40-kg individual with
a wbc count of 104/ml, indicating extensive tissue distribution as
observed in animal models. it was concluded that the pharmacokinetic parameters for  xxxd1722xxx  are proportional to the dose
with no indication of a decline in intracellular triphosphate
concentration with time [64].
the total binding of  xxxd1722xxx  to plasma protein amounts to
47%, and only 27% is bound to human  xxxg124xxx  (hsa), which
could be a factor in producing a wide tissue distribution [65].
when given to male and female patients with all or aml,
 xxxd1722xxx  exhibits balanced clearance, with a renal clearance of
10.8 l/h/m2 (28.8 l/h/m2 total systemic clearance) with 57% of the
dose being excreted unchanged in the urine [36]. the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1722xxx  were further examined in 52 adults with
solid tumors involved in a dose-escalation phase i study with doses
up to 129 mg/m2 administered once a week for 3 weeks every 28
days [66]. it was shown to be time-invariant, with an average
systemic clearance, vdss, and half-life of 18.1 l/h (9.9 l/h/m2), 72 l
(39 l/m2) and 4.0 h, respectively. it was also observed during this
study that, although  xxxd1722xxx  is a purine analogue (as is
ﬂudarabine), its effects on lymphocyte subsets more closely
resemble those of gemcitabine, a pyrimidine analog, in having a
selective detrimental effect on the b-lymphocyte subset [66]. this
observation should be considered when developing appropriate
combination regimens involving  xxxd1722xxx .
under the biopharmaceutics classiﬁcation system,  xxxd1722xxx 
is classiﬁed as a class iii drug. this classiﬁcation is based on the fact
that the adult clearance is 20 l/h while oral bioavailability is
50% with a mean absorption time of 2.0 h (in adult patients with
advanced solid tumors) [56].
4. clinical studies
to date, numerous clinical studies on  xxxd1722xxx  have been
conducted and some with promising results. a wide variability in
responses among the patient populations has been observed,
indicating the complexity of factors that need to be considered
before administering  xxxd1722xxx  [67].
in the phase i trial the maximum tolerated dose (mtd) for
patients with solid tumors was determined at 2 mg/m2 with the
dose-limiting toxicity (dlt) being myelosuppression, while for
patients with hematological malignancies, the mtd was determined at 40 mg/m2/day with the dlt being hepatotoxicity [67].
this discrepancy is explained by the accepted view that drugs for
leukemia cause myelosuppression and cytopenias of limited
duration and thus are not regarded as dose-limiting conditions.
a phase ii study in 62 adult patients with relapsed or refractory
acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome who received
 xxxd1722xxx  at 40 mg/m2 iv once daily for 5 days every 3 to 6 weeks
demonstrated a total response rate of 48% [68]. after the ﬁrst
 xxxd1722xxx  infusion, responders accumulated more  xxxd1722xxx 
triphosphate in blasts than non-responders. this increased only in

a. zhenchuk et al. / biochemical pharmacology 78 (2009) 1351–1359

responders after the second  xxxd1722xxx  infusion, indicating that
cellular pharmacokinetics may have prognostic signiﬁcance.
however, another phase ii trial in adult aml patients demonstrated a minimal response, most likely due to the fact that the
patients were signiﬁcantly more refractory [69].
 xxxd1722xxx  showed promising results in a phase ii trial in
elderly refractory aml patients at doses of 30 mg/m2/day for 5
days every 28–42 days with almost 50% of responders (40–50% cr)
[70]. in particular, this agent appears to be effective for patients
with adverse cytogenetics, with an associated remission rate of
approximately 40%. if this ﬁnding is validated in further studies,
this is an interesting and beneﬁcial feature.
in the phase i trial involving pediatric patients with all and
aml, the mtd was determined to be 52 mg/m2 and the
recommended phase ii dose [62]. the dlt was reversible
hepatotoxicity and skin rash. a total response of 30% was observed
in phase ii trials in pediatric patients suffering from refractory aml
and all treated with  xxxd1722xxx  at doses of 52 mg/m2/day for 5
days every 2–6 weeks [63].
most studies to date show the beneﬁt of oral high-dose
treatment with  xxxd1722xxx . however, it is of interest to establish a
low-dose regimen of  xxxd1722xxx  in tablet form when given during
a longer period of treatment.
the promising in vitro data and results from animal studies led
to the development of combination treatments with  xxxd1722xxx 
and other cytotoxic agents. in this context, a human study
involving treatment with  xxxd1722xxx  (30–40 mg/m2/day) in
combination with arac (20–100 mg/m2/day) in order to enhance
 xxxg611xxx  activity, was undertaken and was found to be more effective in
previously untreated patients with aml and mds than single agent
treatment with comparable toxicity [71,72].
another phase i study on elderly aml patients has revealed that
 xxxd1722xxx , in combination with idarubicine and arac, can lead to
clinical remission. anthracyclines are commonly used to potentiate the activity of other nucleoside analogues, with  xxxd2320xxx 
being the preferred anthracycline in induction and salvage
regimens of patients with aml. the response to combinations of
 xxxd1722xxx  with arac,  xxxd1722xxx  with  xxxd2320xxx , and  xxxd1722xxx 
plus arac and idarubicine in aml salvage studies was not
signiﬁcantly different with a total response of 39% (cr + crp) [73].
a pilot phase i study was conducted on 13 patients with aml
and all being treated with  xxxd1722xxx  in combination with
cyclophosphamide and etoposide to determine the mtd and the
dose-limiting toxicities of the combination [74]. this combination
induced durable remission in children with relapsed or refractory
acute leukemia. the recommended phase ii doses of  xxxd1722xxx ,
cyclophosphamide, and etoposide were 40, 440, and 100 mg/m2/
day, respectively, each given for 5 days in induction. the phase ii
portion of the study is now underway.
treatment with 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide, an activated form of cytoxan, induces dna repair patches, thus increasing
the incorporation of  xxxd1722xxx  triphosphates into dna and
consequently enhances the cytotoxic effect [44]. conversely, the
use of  xxxd1722xxx  prior to cyclophosphamide appeared to augment
both cyclophosphamide-induced dna damage (by phosphorylated
 xxxg1009xxx ) and apoptosis (by sub-2n dna) [75].
in a phase i/ii trial,  xxxd1722xxx  was given in combination with a
myeloablative dose of  xxxd390xxx , an alkylating antineoplastic agent,
in an attempt to develop a pre-transplant conditioning regimen
suitable for patients with refractory, non-remissive hematologic
malignancies at the time of transplant. as a result, all 20 patients
engrafted rapidly, and this combination shows promising antitumor activity in this group of very high-risk patients [76].
in summary, the mtd in patients with solid tumors is 20 times
lower than in patients with hematological malignancies. myelosuppression is the most common adverse affect in the case of solid

1357

tumors, whereas hepatotoxicity seems to be doselimiting in
patients with acute leukemias.  xxxd1722xxx  plasma concentrations
were generally lower in the pediatric population than in the adult
population when the same doses were administered [36].
although it is currently approved only for pediatric patients,
 xxxd1722xxx  showed promising results in usually unresponsive
elderly patients. furthermore, clinical data show that combination
regimens are feasible, but the optimal regimen for  xxxd1722xxx 
combined with other anti-cancer agents remains to be determined.
5. conclusion
in a nutshell,  xxxd1722xxx  exhibits efﬁcacy in hematologic
malignancies such as all, aml, and myelodysplastic syndrome.
like cladribine and ﬂudarabine,  xxxd1722xxx  is toxic to both nonproliferating human lymphocytes and rapidly proliferating cells,
while being resistant to phosphorylitic cleavage and deamination
and stable in acidic environments. it exhibits the highest
lipophilicity among related purine analogues [13] and is resistant
to degradation by e. coli  xxxg1792xxx  [14].  xxxd1722xxx ’s high afﬁnity for nucleoside transporters,  xxxg611xxx , and key
enzymes involved in dna synthesis, as well as the prolonged
intracellular retention of its metabolites, contributes to its potent
anti-cancer activity.
in clinical trials  xxxd1722xxx  shows the potential in the group
with the poorest prognosis: older patients and those with adverse
cytogenetics. it has also been shown to be active both as a single
agent and in combination with other cytotoxic drugs. although
 xxxd1722xxx  acts as a myelosuppressive agent, its toxicity proﬁle
makes the drug potentially useful for patients excluded from
intensive chemotherapy at diagnosis or who have relapsed after
cr.
the process of approving a drug is often a very long and grueling
procedure. taking this into consideration and the fact that
 xxxd1722xxx  has already been approved for the treatment of
pediatric all with a second or higher relapse, new promising
treatments with  xxxd1722xxx  could be implemented at an
accelerated rate. therefore, there is an urgent need to evaluate
more thoroughly its potential in treating cancer. more recent
clinical trials indicate that this drug has a broad-spectrum impact
on a variety of leukemias, a unique property with a substantial
potential for wider application.
the toxicities connected with  xxxd1722xxx  administration are
manageable, thus allowing this drug to be combined effectively
with other chemotherapeutic agents. however, an exact understanding of the  xxxd1722xxx  mechanism of action remains to be
achieved, making it difﬁcult to explain the broad-spectrum
distribution of responses to this drug in ongoing clinical trials.
although the clinical data suggest a higher efﬁcacy of  xxxd1722xxx  in
hematological malignancies, the in vitro anti-angiogenesis activity
[77] can prove the drug useful for treatment of solid tumors.
