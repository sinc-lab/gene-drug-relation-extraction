non-sedating antihistamines

abstract
antihistamines
are effective therapy against hist(1mine-mediated conditions, including seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria. they may
also have a. therapeutic role to play in asthma. until
recently all antihistamines
produced some degree of
drowsiness, as well as having anticholinergic side effects.
several non-sedating antihistamines
have now been developed. evidence suggests that their freedom from central nervous system effects is due to their lack of penetration of the blood-brain barrier. they also have no appreciable binding to cholinergic receptors. two of these
non-sedating antihistamines,
terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx ,
have novel binding characteristics with the histamine h j
receptor, exhibiting irreversible binding at higher concentrations. in humans  xxxd236xxx  has a remarkably long

tamines and that they have no greater incidence of ceniral nervous system or anticholinergic side effects than
placebo.
introduction
istamine was fi.rst identified in 1911 by dale and
laidlaw as a poteilt vasoactive substance· and was
subsequently
found to have a large number of other
physiologic activities. it was not until almost 60 years
after its discovery
that histamine's
activities
were
proven to be mediated through two types of receptors,
an idea advanced by ash and schild in 19662 and substantiated by black and co-workers in 1972.3 the allergy-related effects of histamine are mediated through
its hi receptor and include smooth muscle contraction,
increased vascular permeability and pruritus (table i).
since the first clinically useful antiallergy medications, phenbenzamine
(antergan)
and  xxxd3050xxx 
(neo-antergan),
were introduced in the early 1940s,
antihistamines
have consistently been among the most
widely used drugs in the united states.4 a household
survey conducted
by the opinion research corporation in 1984 suggested
that more than 30 million
americans may take antihistamines
during the course
of a year. 5 total sales of single-entity
antihistamines
(otc plus prescription)
in 1987 amounted
to $211
million.6 the safety profile of antihistamines
is such
that many of these agents are available as over-thecounter products. nonetheless,
this remarkable record
of safety and efficacy has been consistently marred by
one major drawback to the use of these agents in clinical practice, viz., the production of unacceptable
sedation.

the major central nervous system side effect ascribed
to this therapeutic class is that of "drowsiness,"
"sedation" or "tiredness."
depending on the study, this adverse effect occurs in i 0-20% of antihistamine
users,
and in some cases it is so severe as to limit the drugs'
therapeutic
usefulness.7
while sedation
is often
thought of as a nuisance side effect, there are indications that it may under certain circumstances have serious consequences.
performance on tests of psychomotor reflexes arid driving skills8•9 is diminished after taking traditional antihistamines.
some investigators
have raised the possibility that
the impairment of performance observed in the laboratory may have correlates on the highway and in the
factory.lo-l2 both civilian and military airplane pilots
are proscribed from flying while using products containing antihistamines
because of the drugs' potential
impairment of coordination
and induction of drowsiness.13 moreover, ~ntihistamines
potentiate the sedating effects of alcohol, as well as of ens depressants
such as minor tranquilizers. 14.15
until recently all antihistamines
were thought to be
equivalent in efficacy and, depending upon chemical
class, to cause varying degrees of sedation. most practicing allergists would agree with w. w. douglas that
"there is a needlessly large n\lmber of h i blockers and
little distinction
can be made between them on the
basis of efficacy as histamine
antagonists."16
most
clinical allergists would also agree that, while some
antihistamines
are less sedating than others, none is
truly non-sedating.
but in the last few years new therapeutic options for
histamine-mediated
diseases have arisen involving several new antihistamines
that are not sedating. these
agents are classified as "nooclassic"
hi antagonists. 17

both of these agents, terfenadine
(seldane,
merrell
dow) and  xxxd236xxx  ( xxxd236xxx . jansseri). have since
become commercially available as prescription drugs.
others (oxatomide.  xxxd2504xxx , acrivastine) are still in
the developmental
stage.
the 1986 edition of the american medical association's drug evaluation textbook4 summarizes the advantage of the newer antihistamines:
"traditional
antihistamines calise sedation, impair coordination.
and
have other effects on the centra] nervous system. newer
agents (terfenadine.  xxxd236xxx  and the investigational
agents. acrivastine and  xxxd2572xxx )
do not cross the
blood-brain
barrier in appreciable
amounts and are
nonsedating in most patien ts." .
the value of a nonsedating antihistamine
to patients
is reflected. by the widespread acceptance of terfenadine in the two years following its introduction
in
1985. by june, 1987, seldane accounted for 55% of
sales of single-entity antihistamines
and 46% of antihistamine prescriptions.6
in light of this major change in pharmacologic
therapy for seasonal allergic rhinitis, perennial
allergic
rhinitis, allergic urticaria and other conditions involving histamine release, a review of the most important
novel features of the new class of agents is warranted.

the drug and its metabolites are excreted in the feces

in rats and dogs, body distribution studies of terfenadine showed that the compound is found in highest

in the liver, lung and gallbladder.

erfenadine and  xxxd236xxx  have very different re. ceptor binding profiles than classical antihistamines. perhaps this difference might have been predicted from the manner in which they were isolated.
terfenadine
was discovered
not by the time-tested
method of investigating members of classes proven to
be histamine antago~ists, but rather by screening for
antihistaminic activity among a group of chemicals that
had no central nervous system activity. the compounds screened were diverse molecular entities that
had failed as potential new neurolep!ics.
 xxxd236xxx 
was discovered in screen for chemicals that protected
against a 48/80 lethality test in rats.26.27
surprisingly, these two compounds
isolated by directed selection techniques both have remarkable specificity. based on results of bo!h in vitro binding assays
and animal and human tests in vivo, terfenadine and
 xxxd236xxx  were found t() be pharmacologically
specific
for the histamine receptor. 17
in vitro, terfenadine binds tightly to the histamine hi
receptor, as demonstrated

optimal dose and dosing schedule for oral terfenadine.
when 60-mg doses were given every 12 hours for five
doses, a statistically significant reduction of histamine
wheal size persisted for at least 12 hours after the last
dose.33
richards, et al,25 noted that the characteristics
of
 xxxd236xxx  binding to histamine hi receptors are not
entirely clear. the compound showed a high affinity for
non-specific sites and a rather low affinity for histamine
sites under standard assay conditions, with an ic50 of
40 nmoljl, compared to 7.7 and 6.8 nmol/l for chlorpheniramine
and promethazine,
respectively.
however, with a longer incubation time the affinity of  xxxd236xxx  rose almost ten-fold, to an ic50 of 4.7 nmoljl.
this was a first indication of  xxxd236xxx 's
unusually
slow association with (and slow dissociation from) the
histamine receptor.34

tor sites is essentially irreversible (figure 8). for instance, the half-time for decay of  xxxd236xxx  binding to

1000 nmol/l against dopaminergic and muscarinic receptors.34
physiologic assays likewise showed limited interaction with non-histamine receptors. in vivo rat tests
showed ed50 for serotonin inhibition i42-fold greater
than in antihistamine activity tests.26.27tests for anticholinergic activity did not reach an ed50 even at the
160 mg/kg dose.26 in human volunteers, salivary flow
rates were not significantly reduced at a 40 mg dose of
 xxxd236xxx , whereas 16 mg of chlorpheniramine significantly decreased the flow of saliva. 36
both terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx  have been found to
be free of detectable central nervous system effects by
several criteria of psychomotor performance and sedation. in addition to many behavioral studies in animals,38 terfenadine has been found free of significant
sedation in humans. terfenadine has been found not to
impair psychomotor performance or to adversely affect
subjective feelings in tests in which classic sedating
antihistamines (triprolidine, promethazine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine, diphenhydramine,
 xxxd255xxx )
produced depression of central nervous system function.4o.42.43tests used to gauge psychomotor performance included subjective evaluation plus pursuit
rotor and reaction time, visuo-motor coordination, visual acuity and critical flicker fusion. consistent with
these results, terfenadine did not produce eeg changes
associated with sedative behavioral effects in tests in
which diphenhydramine produced such changes.44
furthermore, terfenadine has not been found to interfere with actual driving skills under controlled conditions.9 nor does it potentiate the impairment of psychomotor skills caused by alcohol or diazepam in situations in which diphenhydramine adversely interacts
with these two sedative drugs.45
with  xxxd236xxx , behavioral studies in rodents
showed no effect on intracranial self-stimulation behavior46 or locomotor activity.47 in dogs,  xxxd236xxx 
produced no disturbance of sleep-wakefulness patterns
on the eeg, compared to positive effects seen with
classic antihistamines.46.48
studies in humans with  xxxd236xxx  have substantiated the animal work. neither single doses nor daily
doses for up to two weeks affected scores of alertness,
reactivity, concentration, performance, mood or wellbeing.40.43.49-51
scores were decreased by the classic antihistamine triprolidine and the mast cell-stabilizing
compound ketotifen.  xxxd236xxx  did not potentiate the
sedative effects of alcohol or diazepam.52
the most obvious explanation for this lack of central
nervous system effects is that terfenadine and astern izole and their active metabolites in antihistaminic concentrations do not enter the brain, a hypothesis sup-

ported by the results of radioactive tracer tests. entry of
chemicals into the brain is regulated by an ill-defined
entity called the blood-brain barrier. the blood-brain
barrier resides functionally in the endothelium of cerebral capillaries, 53 selectively permitting substances to
enter the brain that are typically small, water-soluble
molecules that circulate in an uncharged form unbound to protein. in the case of the nonsedating antihistamines, lack of penetration into the brain may relate to large molecular size, a large, charged sidechain,
preferential lipophilicity, circulation as a zwitterion
due to an acidic function at one end of the compound,
and extensive binding to albumin.
the current working hypothesis is that blockade of
histamine receptors in the brain is responsible for inducing sedation.16 while such receptors have been
identified, their function has not yet been clearly delineated.54.55 it is also possible that central nervous system effects of traditional antihistamines are due to interaction with other receptors in the brain. older antihistamines interact with adrenergic, serotonergic and
cholinergic receptors. terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx  lack
interactions with these other receptors.
in acute toxicology studies, terfenadine proved safe
at very high doses. single doses up to 5000 mg/kg were
tolerated by mature rats and mice; single oral doses of
100 mg/kg were well tolerated by dogs, but doses above
150 mg/kg caused emesis.39
long-term toxicity studies revealed no notable pathology in mice at iso mg/kg/day or in dogs at 100
mg/kg/day. at 500 mg/kg/day mice showed some tapering of weight gain and 150 mg/kg/day produced
emesis in dogs. carcinogenicity and teratology studies
have been negative at 50 and 150 mg/kg/day. a fertility study showed reduced implantation in rats at 300
mg/kg/day.38
with  xxxd236xxx , long-term (three to 18 months)
dosing proved safe by all criteria at doses up to 20
mg/kg/day in rats and 10 mg/kg/day in dogs. higher
doses produced emaciation and sometimes abnormalities of male gonads.25.56 at most doses  xxxd236xxx 
caused no abnormalities in fetuses or fertility. but decreased litter size was seen in rats at 40 and 160 mg/kg.
no carcinogenicity was evident at doses of  xxxd236xxx 
up to 80 mg/kg/day for 18 months.25.56
clinical implications of
pharmacokinetics of newer

slower onset of action and a much longer duration of
action than any other antihistamine. 17this means that
terfenadine can be used in emergency situations where
a histamine hi receptor antagonist is indicated, while
 xxxd236xxx  cannot. the slower onset of action of  xxxd236xxx  also suggests that it may not provide as immediate relief of symptoms.
in histamine-induced
skin reaction studies in normal
volunteers, terfenadine produced a significant antihistaminic effect within two hours and a maximal effect
within four hours; this effect lasted eight to 12
hours33.38 (figure 9). in allergic rhinitis studies, onset
of symptom relief has been observed within one-two
hours with complete relief within the first full day of
therapy.33.38
 xxxd236xxx  has a much slower onset and offset of
action. following administration
of one io-mg tablet
ofastemizole
to nonallergic volunteers, it took between
16 and 17 hours to produce half of the maximal inhibition of the flare response to intradermal
histamine.35
maximal inhibition
(68% decrease)
of the flare response occurred between three and four days after a
single 10-mg dose of  xxxd236xxx  and the flare reaction
remained more than 50% inhibited
for about seven
days.35 kinetics of the wheal response were similar36
(figure 10).
the same pattern was seen in clinical studies. a significant reduction in histamine- or allergen-induced
whealing in humans was not seen until three to four
days of therapy with  xxxd236xxx  in studies in which
terfenadine
produced a significant reduction in skin
reactions by two to three hours.57.58 in one direct com-

parative study of efficacy, patients with hay fever taking
terfenadine had a median time to onset of symptom
relief of three hours; for those taking  xxxd236xxx  the
median time to onset of symptom reliefwas two days.59
based on his clinical experience
with  xxxd236xxx ,
holgate notes that it takes three to five days' dosing
with  xxxd236xxx  to reach maximum effect.6o in addition, once it binds to histamine hi receptors, the binding is nearly irreversible with a half-life of up to 19
days.60
to achieve the same rapidity of relief provided by
terfenadine,
it has been suggested that  xxxd236xxx  be
used in a prophylactic fashion, starting dosing before
the pollen season and continuing until pollen counts
subside.51.60 an alternative approach has been to administer  xxxd236xxx  at higher doses (20 to 30 mgjday)
for the first three days of treatment,
since symptom
suppression was clearly less than optimal for at least
three days when the standard
10 mgjday dose was
used51 (figure ii). according to holgate,60 "though
the delayed onset of maximal action of  xxxd236xxx  may
be overcome to some extent by giving a loading dose,
this drug is better
for maintenance
than occasional use."
the long half-life of  xxxd236xxx  permits once-a-day
dosing for effective therapy of allergic symptoms. however, in the event of an untoward effect, this long halflife might prove inconvenient.

sured were significantly
relieved by both antihistamines. total reduction
in symptom scores was 71 %
with terfenadine, 65% with chlorpheniramine
and 30%
in placebo patients.
guill, et al,65 compared terfenadine
to placebo in
children between six and 12 years of age. for children
less than 30 kg, a dose of 30 mg bid was used. for those
heavier than 30 kg, the adult dose was prescribed.
terfenadine was judged (by physicians and parents) as
being effective in 80% of the children,
significantly
better than placebo.
a trial ofterfenadine
and ketotifen against perennial
allergic rhinitis in 142 patients in japan showed good
relief of symptoms
by both of these active drugs
throug~out the four-week study period.66 moderate-toexcellent improvement was achieved in 85% ofterfenadine-treated patients and 81 % of those taking ketotifen.
in allergic dermatological
disorders, terfenadine has
been tested in" botp. placebo-controlled
and positivecontrolled dquble-blind trials. cerio and lessof67 conducted the first placebo-controlled,
cross-over trial of
terfenadine in 24 patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria. symptom scores were significantly lower with
terfenadine
(six) than with placebo (32.5) after one
o/eek of treatment.
these results were confirmed by
ferguson, et al,68 during a two-week trial in 14 patients
who had suffered from chronic idiopathic urticaria for
longer than three months, and by krause and shuster, 69
who found that terfenadine reduced itching and hives
by between 50% and 70%.
the effectiveness of terfenadine against allergic skin
conditions
was substantiated
by comparisons
with
classic antihistamines.
sixty patients with chronic allergic urticaria of longer than six months' duration
were included by fredriksson
and colleagues70 in a
two-week cross-over trial comparing
terfenadine
to
placebo and a positive control, c1emastine. terfenadine was significantly more effective than both placebo
and c1emastine in reducing itching and hives and providing overall relief. in a much larger trial. harada and
co-workers71 in japan treated 321 chronic urticaria patients with terfenadine
or clemastine
for one week.
terfenadine was slightly but not significantly more effective overall (72% relief vs. 66%). terfenadine
provided good-to- excellent relief of itching and hives in
77% of patients, compared to 71 % with c1emastine.
a large, multi:center,
six-week trial in the u.s. in
121 chronic idiopathic urticaria patients substantiated
these findings.72 investigators'
ratings showed that terfenadine provided good-to-excellent.
results in 83% of
patients, higher than with chlorphenira"mine
(71 %) and
placebo (29%). as well, only 9% of patients taking terfenadine used the escape medication
(diphenhydramine), significantly less than either chlorpheniraminetreated patients
(26%) or placebo patients
(52%).

658

throughout the six-week study period terfenadine provided a continuing
high level of relief of symptoms
(number
of hives, hours during which hives were
present, redness and pruritus).
relief of asthma is an additional
possible use of
non-sedating
antihistamines
now being investigated
that is not within the clinical scope of older agents. it
has been demonstrated
both in vitro and in vivo that
there is a histaminic component to asthma.73 but previous antihistamines
could not be tested in asthmatic
patients at effective doses because their activity on
other receptors has been claimed to produce adverse
effects. because terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx  have little
or no cross-reaction with non-histamine
receptors, they
can be used to test for an antihistamine-responsive
component in asthma.
research with terfenadine in exercise-induced
bronchospasm has already been published.74-76 patej14 explored the effect of either 60, 120 or 180 mg of terfenadine against exercise-induced
asthma in ten patients.
at the two higher doses terfenadine
produced significant prqtection against exercise-induced
bronchoconstriction compared to placebo. pierson et al,76 also
showed that 60, 120 or 180 mg of terfenadine substantially reduced the bronchospasm
occurring after treadmill exercise in asthma patients. the protective effect
was highest (50% protection against bronchospasm)
at
180 mg.
rafferty and holgate75 showed that terfenadine at all
three doses tested (60, 120 and 180 mg) produced significant bronchodilation
in nine patients with mild
asthma, increasing fev i about 10% above baseline.
when these patients were challenged with an inhaled
histamine bronchial provocation test, terfenadine provided significant dose-related protection against bronchoconstriction.
this promising bronchodilating
effect of terfenadine
was confirmed in a two-week, double-blind,
placebocontrolled cross-over trial of terfenadine in 52 patients
with mild perennial asthma conducted in france.77 patients received two weeks of treatment with either terfenadine or placebo given in random order. terfenadine was given at 120 mg bid, twice the recommended
dose for allergic rhinitis. terfenadine
significantly reduced both patients' self-rated symptom scores and
consumption of inhaled salbutamol. there was a significant increase in peak flow while patients were taking
terfenadine. in this blinded study, half of the patients
preferred terfenadine at the end, significantly higher
than the number choosing placebo (22%). the investigators concluded that, "the place of hi-antihistamines
in the management
of mild allergic asthma warrants
reassessment with newer specific h i-antagonists which
can be used at higher doses without causing sedation."

rhinitis were conducted by callier78 and by wilson and
hillas.79 in one of the earliest studies, callier et al,78
studied the effect of a loading dose of  xxxd236xxx  (10
mgjday for five days or one dose of 50 mg) followed by
weekly dosing for two or six weeks. symptom severity
scores were significantly reduced by  xxxd236xxx  relative
to placebo and  xxxd1763xxx 
use was reduced in patients taking  xxxd236xxx .
investigators'
global assessments of good-to-excellent
results were significantly
better for  xxxd236xxx  for both regimens. this is the only
published trial to use weekly dosing.
wilson and hillas79 conducted a trial of prophylactic
 xxxd236xxx . they also used a loading dose, 90 mg on
day one and 40 mg on day two, and commenced daily
therapy of 10 mg several weeks before pollen counts
rose. patients taking  xxxd236xxx  had significantly lower
symptoms
scores and took significantly
less of the
escape medication (the antihistamine
 xxxd2906xxx ).
malmberg et al,8o compared  xxxd236xxx  10 mgjday to
75 mgjday of  xxxd2906xxx 
or placebo in 51 patients
with seasonal rhinitis to birch pollen in finland.  xxxd236xxx  was significantly superior in reducing nasal and
ocular symptoms at weeks one and three. investigators'
global ratings showed good-to-excellent
improvement
in 62% ofastemizole-treated
patients, compared to 40%
taking  xxxd2906xxx 
and 33% on placebo. differences
were not significant.
moller and 10hansson81 studied  xxxd236xxx  and clemastine in 60 children between the ages of six and 16
years who had birch pollen allergy. a 5 mgjday-dose of
 xxxd236xxx  was used. symptom relief did not differ between  xxxd236xxx  and clemastine.
 xxxd236xxx  and terfenadine have been compared in
one clinical trial, conducted
by holgate and howarth.82 treatment
was according to a prophylactic
protocol, with dosing beginning before the pollen season. in this study  xxxd236xxx  was significantly better
than terfena~ine or placebo at relieving several allergic
symptoms. surprisingly, placebo was superior to terfenadine in relieving some symptoms. this result was
noted by richards, et at,25 who commented:
in the only comparative study with another antihistamine claimed to be non-sedating,
 xxxd236xxx 
was significantly more effective than either terfenadine or placebo in alleviating itching eyes, sneezing and runny nose. however, 20 to 30% of the
patients in each group dropped out because of a
lack of symptom relief, and the puzzling finding
that placebo was also significantly more effective
than terfenadine suggests that these· results must
be interpreted with caution.
treatment in this trial was started before the pollen
season to achieve greater efficacy with  xxxd236xxx .
therefore,
it is not possible to know whether equal

numbers of equally affected patients were contained in
each treatment group.
in perennial rhinitis,  xxxd236xxx  was evaluated by
mygind, et al,83 in 45 patients with non-allergic perennial rhinitis. treatment was carried out for 14 weeks,
with a partial cross-over design incorporating
placebo
tablets.  xxxd236xxx  significantly reduced the number of
sneezes to 45% of the placebo level and the number of
nose-blowings
to 56% of the placebo level. patients
who experienced
primarily nasal blockage were not
measurably helped.
 xxxd236xxx  also has been demonstrated
to have a
beneficial effect on chronic allergic urticaria. knight84
tested  xxxd236xxx  in 37 patients with chronic urticaria
in a four-week, double-blind,
placebo-controlled
trial.
both urticaria and pruritus were significantly alleviated
by  xxxd236xxx , with most of the gain coming from improvement of symptoms from the "moderate"
to the
"mild" category.
trials with  xxxd236xxx  in asthma have been done. in
an early pharmacodynamic
study in humans, 10 mg of
 xxxd236xxx  bid for three days raised the threshold of
airway response to inhaled histamine in asthmatic patients.85 in a clinical trial conducted by clee, et al,86
patients were pretreated with  xxxd236xxx  for two weeks
and then tested for exercise-induced
bronchospasm.
 xxxd236xxx  protected against challenge, but protection
was greater one week after drug was stopped than it was
during active treatment. holgate, et al,87 also measured
the ability of  xxxd236xxx 
to protect against a fall in
fey i in asthmatic patients. nine patients with allergic
asthma were treated with  xxxd236xxx ,
10 mgjday for
two weeks, then challenged
with antigen. the early
component
of bronchoconstriction
was decreased between two and 15 minutes after challenge by 40 to 80%,
but no significant protection was seen after about 20
minutes.
is it possible to reach 90% to 100% clinical efficacy in
allergic rhinitis with antihistamines?
current best results with terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx  in allergic rhinitis
are 60 to 80% relief, equal to results obtained with older
antihistamines.
perhaps the limitation of benefit seen
so far is a dose effect. patients' sensitivity to drug therapy distributes on a normal curve of drug dose. older
antihistamines
produce considerable
drowsiness
at
higher doses, so it is virtually impossible to reach a dose
at which all patients respond. with the newer, non-sedating antihistamines,
it may be possible to push doses
high enough to benefit virtually all patients. this possibility could be tested by systematically
administering
increasing doses of a non-sedating antihistamine
to patients who do not respond at the recommended
dose.
better results have already been obtained in chronic
urticaria88 and asthma 74-76with higher doses of terfenadine ( 120 and 180 mg bid) than the recommended

mg bid. recommended
doses based on the original
dose-ranging
studies are somewhat
arbitrary.
a i
mg/kg dose was found optimal in animal studies and
translated to humans assuming an average 60-kg person. in humans, the first histamine whealing studies
showed that 60 mg of terfenadine gave maximal inhibition. but these studies used a "medium" dose of histamine.
an alternative explanation
for a less than complete
response rate to antihistamines
in allergic patients is
that symptoms may be due to other mediators in addition to histamine. mast cells also release leukotrienes,
kin ins and prostaglandins,
amongst other mediators,
which are physiologically active substances not antagonized by antihistamines.
adverse effects
reclinical findings suggesting that the newer antihistamines are highly specific for histamine hi receptors and do not enter the brain have been verified in
clinical trials. patients taking terfenadine have experienced no greater incidence of drowsiness or sedation
than those taking placebo in trials in which reference
antihistamines
such as diphenhydramine,
chlorpheniramine and clemastine have produced frequencies of
sedation between 15% and 25%38 (figure 14).
there have been. however, anecdotal reports from
holland of automobile
accidents
involving persons
who had taken terfenadine. statistically. one would expect this phenomenon
to occur as a matter of chance
when two such high-frequency activities as driving and
taking antihistamines
are involved. to settle the possible causative role of terfenadine.
the dutch government sponsored on-road driving tests monitored by an
independent
research team for ten individuals experi-

encing sedation while taking terfenadine, two of whom
had been involved in automobile accidents. in a double-blind, placebo-controlled
driving test under reallife conditions, no difference was found in the subjects'
driving performance after ta~ing either terfenadine or
placebo.89
dramatic evidence for the lack of central nervous
system effects of terfenadine comes from anecdotal reports in which persons have ingested massive quanti~ies
of the drug, either alone or with other agents such as
valium, inadvertantly
or in a suicide attempt.90 one
16-year-old woman took 25 tablets (1500 mg) of terfenadine. she was treated with gastric lavage within
approximately
one hour of ingestion and completely
recovered without incident. the only physiologic effect
noted was a gecrease in blood pressure from 110/60 to
90/50 mm hg at' two hours after admission. several
such reports document ingestion of thousands of milligrams of terfenadine at a time, while the daily therapeutic dose of terfenadine is 120 mg (60 mg every 12
hours). the symptoms described were nausea, lightheadedness, somnolence and headache and in all instances recovery was complete.
because of its specific receptor binding and cns
profile. terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx . the only non-sedating antihistamines
so far approved in the united
states. lack the mandated warnings and contraindications required for all other antihistamines.
it also is not
contraindicated
in asthma patients, largely as a result of
its lack of anticholinergic
effects. antagonism of the
cholinergic receptors by glassical antihistamines
has
been claimed to lead to drying of mucous plugs in the
bronchi, inhibiting clearing of the airways. this hypothesized side effect could be important in clinical
practice, since one survey found that 58.6% of asthma
patients said that they also had an upper respiratory
allergy. ~
 xxxd236xxx  has similarly been found to have an incidence of cns effects no higher than that produced by
placebo91 (figure 15). an increase in appetite and
weight gain have been seen in at least three trials.79.83.84
in the trial by wilson and hillas,79 six of seven patients
taking  xxxd236xxx 
in a longer-term
open trial (16
weeks) experienced weight gain. knight84 reported increased appetite or weight gain in five of 36 patients
during a four-week treatment
period. according
to
vanden bussche,91 "weight gain is probably a true
drug-related effect."
in overdose  xxxd236xxx  can cause serious ventricular
tachycardia.92
in march, 1987, the committee
on
safety in medicines in the united kingdom reported
three such occurrences.93 one patient had taken 200
mg at one time, another had taken 400 mg, and a third
had taken 20 mg/day for several weeks. the last patient

had a plasma  xxxd236xxx  concentration
only three times
higher than the therapeutic range. all patients recovered. antiarrhythmic
medication had to be given for
several days until the antihistamine
was eliminated. in
january, 1987, the manufacturer
of  xxxd236xxx  (janssen) sent a warning letter to physicians in the united
kingdom emphasizing that only 10 mgjday should be
taken and that when "loading doses" are used they
should be limited to 30 mgjday and only given for
three to a maximum of seven days. in addition, when
 xxxd236xxx  overdose is suspected, an ecg is mandatory.
newer antihistamines
do not appear to have the
drawback of tachyphylaxis,
or the development
of tolerance with prolonged treatment. in two trials terfenadine has demonstrated
continued efficacy with longer
therapy.72.94
in one trial,94 a group of patients with seasonal rhinitis who initially responded to terfenadine were continued on the drug during the remainder of the fall pollen
season. approximately
85% of patients treated with
terfenadine during the initial phase responded. during
the next eight weeks, 90% of these subjects continued
to get equal or greater symptom relief,
the other study was a multi-center,
double-blind,
placebo-controlled
trial ofterfenadine
for chronic idiopathic urticaria.72 following a single-blind,
placebo
lead-in period, patients who still had symptoms of urticaria were treated for six weeks with either chlorpheniramine, terfenadine
or placebo. the authors concluded that both active drugs provided significant relief
of symptoms within 24 to 48 hours of the start of treat-

ment and reached maximal efficacy by two to three
days. moreover, maximal relief was sustained throughout the six-week trial for terfenadine on all measures,
whereas there was some evidence of development
of
tolerance for chlorpheniramine.
with  xxxd236xxx , no sign of tachyphylaxis
was seen
in inhibition of the weal and flare reactions to histamine during three months of therapy in patients with
chronic urticaria.36 a similar maintenance of effect was
observed by krause and shuster69 during four weeks of
therapy.

summary
fter nearly five decades of effective but sedating
antihistamines,
compounds
have finally become
available that block the effects of histamine but do not
affect the central nervous system and cause drowsiness
or sedation. these drugs are effective against histamine-mediated
allergies, including seasonal rhinitis,
perennial rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria.
although the two non-sedating
antihistamines
with
the greatest clinical experience appear to be equally
effiacacious against allergic rhinitis, they have greatly
different
pharmacokinetics.
terfenadine
improves
symptoms within hours, with peak relief coming in six
to eight hours and a detectable effect lasting 16 to 24
hours.  xxxd236xxx 
has a slower onset and a much
longer half-life. its time to peak action is a matter of
days, and it takes one week or more to clear half of it
from the body.
the major drawback to the clinical use of the nonsedating antihistamines
is cost. due to the considerably
higher cost of terfenadine (and presumably the other
nonsedating
antihistamines
when they become clinically available), its use could arguably be restricted to
that portion of the population
in whom the classical
antihistamines
cannot be used or for whom cost is not a
major consideration.
many patients tolerate classical
antihistamines
well or accommodate
quickly to their
soporific effects. the physician must weigh the evidence of efficacy, the frequency and seriousness of side
effects and cost in determining
the choice of an antihistamine. if costs were equivalent, the newer antihistamines would have an advantage due to equal efficacy
and reduced side effects.
