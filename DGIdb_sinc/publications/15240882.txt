thyroid hormones are involved in the regulation of many physiological processes and regulate gene transcription by binding to
their nuclear receptors tr␣ and tr␤. in the absence of triiodothyronine (t3), the unliganded receptors (aporeceptors) do bind dna
and repress the transcription of target genes. the role of thyroid
hormone aporeceptors as repressors was observed in hypothyroid
adult mice, but its physiological relevance in nonpathological
hypothyroid conditions remained to be determined. here we show
that, in the normal mouse fetus, tr␣ aporeceptors repress heart
rate as well as the expression of tr␤ and several genes encoding
ion channels involved in cardiac contractile activity. right after
birth, when t3 concentration sharply increases, liganded tr␣
(holoreceptors) turn on the expression of some of these same
genes concomitantly with heart rate increase. these data describe
a physiological situation under which conversion of tr␣ from
apo-receptors into holo-receptors, upon changes in t3 availability,
plays a determinant role in a developmental process.

t

hyroid hormones (ths) are involved in the regulation of
many physiological and developmental processes. at the
molecular level, ths regulate gene transcription mostly through
the triiodothyronine (t3) form, which binds to nuclear receptors, encoded by the tr␣ and tr␤ genes (1). th receptors
(trs) are transcription factors with ligand-regulated activity. in
the absence of t3, the unliganded receptors (aporeceptors)
recruit corepressors and repress the transcription of target
genes. upon hormone binding, the receptors (holoreceptors)
exchange corepressors for coactivators and activate transcription
(2). this repressive effect of aporeceptors has been clearly
documented in hypothyroid mice for tr␣ in brain, bone,
intestine, spleen, and heart (3, 4). these observations suggested
that the conversion of tr aporeceptors into holoreceptors as a
result of a change in t3 concentration in vivo might act as a
molecular switch under physiological conditions. one situation
in which t3 level naturally changes during life is during the
transition from fetal to neonatal life. in mice, fetal circulating
levels of t3 are quite low (5–7) and highly increase at birth,
reaching a maximum during the first postnatal weeks (almost
2,000-fold increase) and decreasing to the adult level by the end
of the second week (6, 7). therefore, the early postnatal period
appears as a natural hyperthyroid situation after a fetal period
of relative hypothyroidism. this transition may allow for rapid
and simultaneous triggering of different gene expression programs involved in the major developmental and maturation
events of this postnatal period. it is already well known that t3
plays a critical role during this period, regulating the maturation
of different organs such as bone, brain, and intestine. all these
events are severely impaired in mice devoid of trs (8–12) and
in hypothyroid mice (3, 4). heart function is critically controlled
by t3 in the adult where hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism
respectively induce bradycardia and tachycardia (1). in this
study, cardiac activity was chosen as the model to address the

physiological relevance of the t3 switch during the neonatal
ontogenetic process.
the respective role of each receptor in the regulation of
cardiac function was previously established in adult mice by
different studies using either genetically modified mice harboring mutation of tr␣ and兾or tr␤ (13–20) or treatment with
specific tr␤ agonist (13). tr␣, which is the predominant
isoform in the heart, plays a major role in determining heart rate
(hr) under baseline conditions, whereas tr␤, even though
expressed at a lower level, is involved in the response to acute
stimulation by t3 (14–16).
several genes encoding ion channels involved in cardiac
contractile activity have been shown to be positively or negatively
regulated by ths in the adult mouse heart (14, 17). among these
genes,  xxxg1029xxx , which encodes a component of the pacemaker, is
of particular interest. its expression has been shown to be
positively regulated exclusively through the tr␣ pathway and to
be severely repressed in hypothyroid mice (14). this repression
seems to depend on tr␣ aporeceptors, because  xxxg1029xxx  expression was restored by knocking out the tr␣ gene in the hypothyroid background (4). in adult heart,  xxxg1029xxx  can thus be
considered as a bona fide tr␣ target gene, repressed by the
aporeceptor and activated by the holoreceptor. some other
genes such as the ones encoding kcbn1 and  xxxg1234xxx , two
voltage-gated k⫹ channel ␣-subunits contributing to the main
repolarizing k⫹ currents in the adult mouse ventricle (14, 17),
are also positively regulated by t3. in contrast, the  xxxg1268xxx  and
 xxxg1245xxx  (mink) genes that encode k⫹ channel subunits, which
generate the slow component of delayed cardiac rectification,
have been shown to be down-regulated by t3 in hyperthyroid
adult mice and up-regulated in hypothyroid mice. this regulation seems to be mediated mostly by tr␣ (14, 17).
the aim of the present work was to determine whether tr␣
aporeceptors play a role during fetal and postnatal development.
this question was addressed by using the heart as a model.
this study shows that in the fetus tr␣ aporeceptors repress
hr as well as the expression of several genes like  xxxg1029xxx ,  xxxg1245xxx ,
kcbn1,  xxxg1234xxx ,  xxxg1268xxx , and tr␤. in contrast, after birth,
when t3 becomes available, tr␣ holoreceptors lose this repressing effect and even activate the expression of some of these
genes concomitantly with stimulation of hr. these data provide
therefore evidence for a role of tr␣ aporeceptors under physiological conditions. they further establish that the tr␣ receptor is a molecular switch controlling heart function near birth
time.

methods
animal conditioning. animal care procedures were conducted in

accordance with the guidelines set by the european community
council directives.
mice devoid of all known isoforms produced by the tr␣ locus
(tr␣0/0) are described in ref. 18. fifteen tr␣0/0 female mice
were mated with tr␣0/0 male mice to obtain 100% tr␣0/0
littermates. twenty-four wt female mice were mated with wt
males to provide wt control animals. to produce 100% tr␣0/⫹,
heterozygous littermates carried by tr␣0/0 homozygous mothers, tr␣0/0 females were mated with wt males. the tr␣0/0 and
wt genitors used in this study were both derived from parallel
littermates obtained by intercrossing tr␣0/⫹ heterozygous genitors to provide control and mutant animals with the same genetic
background.
embryonic day 0.5 postcoitum (pc) was defined as noon of the
day a vaginal plug was detected after overnight mating. mice
were studied between days 9.5 and 19.5 pc in the wt and tr␣0/0
populations and at days 18.5 and 19.5 pc for heterozygous
littermates. day 9.5 pc corresponds to the onset of spontaneous
cardiac activity.
studies were performed with mice under general anesthesia
(1–1.5% isoflurane) by using specific equipment and a dedicated
control system of body temperature (minerve, esternay,
france). the rectal temperature of pregnant mice was maintained at 37°c ⫾ 1°c throughout the experiments.

chine was used (hdi 5000, philips medical systems, andover,
ma) with a per-operative linear transducer (entos cl15-7). a
midline or parasagittal transabdominal approach was used to
examine the uterine horns. the abdominal cavity was virtually
divided in four quadrants: left and right cranial segments, and
left and right caudal segments. when more than four fetuses
were present in the abdomen, measurements were performed on
only one fetus per abdominal quadrant to ensure that no fetus
would be studied twice during the experiment.
the ultrasonic probe was operated at the highest frequency
range (‘‘resolution mode,’’ 15 mhz; axial resolution measured at
⫺20 db, 600 microns; lateral resolution measured at ⫺20 db, 700
microns). fetuses were located by using gray-scale b mode
images and were selected so anatomical landmarks were present
nearby (kidneys and bladder), allowing for a consistent identification of the fetus being studied at each measurement step.
a color-doppler volume was superimposed on the gray-scale
image to locate blood flow within the heart, the dorsal aorta, and
the umbilical cord (fig. 1a). after identification of the vessels of
interest, pulsed-wave doppler interrogations were performed,
placing the sample volume successively on the dorsal aorta and
the umbilical artery. the doppler settings were as follows:
sample volume size, 0.5 mm; wall filter, medium level; gain level,
65–80%; angle of insonation, ⬍60°c. the pulse repetition
frequency was set to record the maximum velocities without
aliasing (3,500–4,000 hz). from these time-velocity curves, the
fetal hr was determined. the maternal hr also was recorded
at the beginning and at the end of the procedure from doppler
interrogation of the abdominal aorta.
data were acquired from embryos and fetuses between days
9.5 and 19.5 pc. the total number of data sets was 138,
corresponding to 46 fetuses for the tr␣0/0 group, and 186,
corresponding to 75 fetuses for the wt group. to record hrs
from tr␣0/⫹ heterozygous fetuses, 10 measurements were obtained, corresponding to six fetuses from two different littermates. data were collected at days 18.5 and 19.5 pc.

the mixture was heated at 37°c for 60 min and then at 70°c for
5 min to inactivate the m-mlv reverse transcriptase.
quantitative pcr. two kinds of quantitative pcr systems were

used: the sybr green dna-binding dye and the assays-ondemand taqman probe (applied biosystems). amplifications
were performed with a dna engine opticon 2 system (mj

standard curve method was used to determine relative quantification of genes of interest and compare the amounts of mrna
in control and treated groups of animals, normalized to the arbp
reference gene (unigene no. mm.5286), a gene encoding a

results
hr measurements. we first measured the hr of pregnant females

and their fetuses from either wt or tr␣0/0 genotype (7) during

course of pregnancy by using doppler ultrasound. in this first
experiment, mothers and fetuses were from the same genotype.
as shown in fig. 1b, the hr of pregnant mice of either
genotype did not change significantly over the whole gestation
period and was slightly higher than hr of nonpregnant 11-wkold adult mice (a11). at any time point, adult tr␣0/0 females
displayed bradycardia as compared with their wt counterparts.
heartbeats of wt fetuses were slow (100 beats per minute) at
day 9.5 pc, increased slowly until day 17.5 pc, and then became
faster to the end of gestation. adult rate was not yet reached in
18-day-old pups (p18). quite surprisingly, the hr of the tr␣0/0
fetuses was always higher than the one recorded for wt. in
contrast, 18 days after birth, both strains of mice showed very
similar hr.
to check whether the higher hr recorded for tr␣0/0 mutant
fetuses was a consequence of the tr␣0/0 mothers’ environment,
we measured the hr of heterozygous fetuses (tr␣0/⫹) carried
by tr␣0/0 mothers. as shown in fig. 1c, measurements at days
18.5 and 19.5 pc clearly showed that hrs of the heterozygotes
were intermediate between those of wt and homozygous
tr␣0/0 fetuses, suggesting an autonomous fetus phenotype.
gene expression analysis in euthyroid mice. to further understand

the molecular basis of this effect on the developing heart, we
investigated the expression of cardiac genes known to be regulated by t3 or relevant to the observed phenotype. measurements were done at three different developmental stages: 15.5day-old fetuses (e15.5 fetuses), p18, and a11.
as shown in fig. 2 a–f, mrna levels of  xxxg1029xxx , tr␤,  xxxg1245xxx ,
 xxxg1237xxx , and  xxxg1234xxx  strongly increased in wt animals during
the first 18 postnatal days. except for  xxxg1234xxx , their expression
then decreased to different levels in the adult. expression of
 xxxg1268xxx  decreased constantly from fetus to adult stages. the
level of expression of the tr␣1 mrna in the wt animals was
the same at all of the developmental stages (data not shown).
in the tr␣0/0 fetuses, all six genes showed a much higher level
of expression than in the wt fetuses (fig. 2 a–f, hatched bars).
in mutant pups the level of expression of all six genes was lower
than that observed in wt pups. in the adult mutants, expression
of  xxxg1029xxx  and  xxxg1234xxx  was inferior to that observed in wt adults
(fig. 2 a and e), whereas expression of tr␤,  xxxg1237xxx , and
 xxxg1268xxx  was not different between mutant and wt animals (fig.
2 b, d, and f), and the expression of  xxxg1245xxx  was superior in
mutant as compared with wt animals (fig. 2c).
an overview of the change in the expression of these genes as a
result of tr␣ knockout, at the three different stages analyzed, is
presented in fig. 2g. it appears clear that the situation is significantly different for fetal and postnatal stages. in the fetus, all six
genes appeared activated in the mutants. in contrast, in the pups,
the levels of expression of all these genes were decreased to
different levels in mutant animals as compared with wt. in the
adult, the situation is similar to that in p18 for all genes except for
 xxxg1245xxx . in the mutant adult heart, this last gene showed an
‘‘activation’’ phenotype similar to what is described in ref. 14.
effect of stimulation by ths on gene expression. the previous
results strongly suggested that these genes were actively repressed by the tr␣ aporeceptor in wt fetuses. to further
investigate this hypothesis, we checked whether this repression
could be alleviated by chronic th treatment of the mother. as
shown in fig. 3, all genes except  xxxg1268xxx  showed a strong
enhancement of their level of expression in the heart of e15.5
wt fetuses carried by t3-treated mothers, reinforcing our
hypothesis. the level of expression of the tr␣1 mrna in the
wt fetuses was not affected by treatment of the mothers with
ths (data not shown).
furthermore, to exclude any role of tr␤ receptors in the
enhanced level of expression of the tested genes in the tr␣0/0
mai et al.

fetuses, we checked whether these genes could be activated by t3
in tr␣0/0 fetuses (fig. 3, hatched bars). we did not see any
significant change in the expression of any of the tested genes in
homozygous e15.5 mutants carried by tr␣0/0 mothers under
chronic treatment with t3. all of the genes even showed a slight
decrease in expression for unexplained reasons.
discussion
our data strongly suggest that in the wt fetus, tr␣ receptors
repress cardiac function. previous data have shown that domimai et al.

nant negative tr␣ mutant receptors working as constitutive
transcriptional repressors strongly reduce the hr in adult mice
(20, 21). therefore, we might assume that in the fetal heart, tr␣
behave as aporeceptors repressing hr.
these data also confirmed that the adult mutant mice devoid
of tr␣ are bradycardic (14, 15, 22–24). they further show that
the basal hr of both wt and mutant pregnant mice is slightly
elevated as compared with nonpregnant animals with the respective genotype. such a difference was already described for
wt mice (25).

by wt mothers. hatched bars correspond to ratios for tr␣0/0 mutant fetuses carried by tr␣0/0 mothers. mean values are given with 95% confidence
intervals.

our observation of an intermediate hr in heterozygous
fetuses as compared with wt and mutant homozygous fetuses
shows that the increase in hr in the tr␣0/0 fetuses is
genetically controlled at the level of the tr␣ gene and that the
degree of fetal tachycardia depends on an autonomous gene
dosage effect.
from a molecular standpoint, we observed an increased
expression of the cardiac genes studied in tr␣0/0 fetuses as
compared with wt fetuses. it was shown previously that  xxxg1029xxx 
is a target for repression by tr␣ aporeceptors in hypothyroid
adult mice (4). we might then assume that, during normal fetal
life when t3 circulating level is low, tr␣ aporeceptors actually
work as repressors on some cardiac genes that are up-regulated
by t3 later in life. this hypothesis was confirmed by the
observation that all those genes could actually be up-regulated
in the heart of wt fetuses if t3 is provided by chronic t3
treatment of the mother.
interestingly, it should be noted that the differences between
treated and untreated groups observed for  xxxg1029xxx , tr␤,
 xxxg1245xxx , and  xxxg1237xxx  were within the same range as those seen
between tr␣0/0 mutants and wt in euthyroid mothers (compare figs. 3 and 2g). taken together, these observations
strongly suggest that in the wt fetus, the  xxxg1029xxx  gene and
presumably all other tested genes are repressed by the tr␣
aporeceptors and that the availability of t3 releases this
blockage. we could exclude the hypothesis that remaining
tr␤ receptors in tr␣0/0 mutants could be responsible for
activating expression of the tested genes because in these
mutant fetuses the treatment with t3 was totally insufficient
to induce gene expression.
in the adult mouse, the  xxxg1245xxx  gene has been shown to be
repressed by t3 (14, 17). this could explain why the expression
of the gene is enhanced in tr␣0/0 adult mutants (fig. 2g, a11).
it is therefore interesting to see that this gene undergoes
opposite regulations in response to t3 in fetus vs. adult.  xxxg1268xxx 
is also down-regulated in hyperthyroid adult mice (14, 17),
whereas it is insensitive to t3 in the fetus.
conclusion
this work shows that the expression of all tested genes in the
heart is controlled by tr␣ in opposite ways before and after
birth. because the  xxxg1029xxx  gene is repressed by tr␣ aporeceptors in hypothyroid adult mice (4), we propose that the same
mechanism accounts for repression of the gene in normal fetal
heart, and by extension for repression of the other tested genes.
at the end of the fetal development and mainly during the
early postnatal period, the availability of t3 mostly produced
10336 兩 www.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0401843101

by the fetus itself releases this blockage. it should be noted
that in p18, the differences in expression of all of the tested
genes between wt and tr␣0/0 do not strictly correlate with
differences in hr, suggesting that these genes are not the only
genes controlling heart activity at this period of development.
activation of the expression of the tr␤ gene by tr␣ holoreceptors has not been previously documented in the mouse,
although it has been described in the metamorphosing tadpole
(26). together with the fact that the expression of the tr␤ gene
is increased in tr␣0/0 mutants, it strongly suggests that this
expression in the fetal heart is directly controlled by the tr␣
receptor. because such an activation was not observed in the
hyperthyroid adult heart (17), we might conclude that this kind
of regulation of the tr␤ gene by tr␣ in the heart is specific
to the fetal organ. similarly, differences in regulation by t3
of  xxxg1245xxx  and  xxxg1268xxx  between adults and fetuses suggest
that tr␣ receptors work differently in adult and fetal heart
environments.
these data clearly demonstrate that during normal fetal
development the tr␣ aporeceptors created by low levels of t3
exert a physiologic role by repressing heart function. therefore,
the tr␣ receptor might be considered a molecular switch
controlling heart function near birth time.
so far, no mutation has been identified in the tr␣ gene in
humans, whereas mutations in the tr␤ gene result in the
syndrome of resistance to ths (27, 28). presumably, if mutations
of tr␣ do exist in humans, their symptoms might be quite
different from those of resistance to ths. although the ontogeny of heart function is quite different between mice and
humans, the data presented here for mice suggest that deregulation of heart function in the human fetus and newborn might
constitute relevant symptoms for tr␣ mutations.
the present observations made on the fetal heart might be
instructive for investigating similar effects of tr␣ aporeceptors
on the development and兾or function of other fetal organs.
indeed, it has been shown that tr␣ aporeceptors block the
maturation of several tissues in experimentally induced hypothyroid mice (4), and these same tissues might be appropriate to
extend this model apo-tr␣ to holo-tr␣-switching effect during
normal development.
