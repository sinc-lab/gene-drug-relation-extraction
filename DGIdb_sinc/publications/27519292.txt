studies on tyrosinase have recently gained the attention of researchers due to the enzyme’s biological
functions and potential applications in food and cosmetic applications. in this present study, screening
and kinetic evaluation of small molecules (>300 da) on human tyrosinase was carried out using surface plasmon resonance and molecular docking studies. four molecules showed signiﬁcant binding were
further characterized. the binding constant kd (m) values obtained for crocin, curcumin, tannic acid,
pyrogallol and hydroquinone are 5.60 × 10−5 , 1.52 × 10−3 , 6.45 × 10−5 , 1.34 × 10−5 and 2.433 × 10−7 m
respectively. in silico docking studies using autodock indicated signiﬁcant binding and revealed the binding pocket residues for all molecules. the study shows the biacore/spr sensor’s ability for screening and
detection of inhibitors for human tyrosinase. this study can be used to rapidly screen and optimize various
lead compounds as binders/inhibitors/modulators of human tyrosinase enzyme activity.

1. introduction
melanocytes are key components of the skin’s pigmentary
system through their ability to produce melanin and tyrosinase
is the core enzyme in melanogenesis. they catalyze the orthohydroxylation of monophenols such as tyrosine and the subsequent
oxidation to quinones to form melanin. both types of reactions
require molecular oxygen as the second substrate of the enzyme
[1,2]. tyrosinases are widely distributed in the bacterial, animal and
plant kingdoms at all phylogenetic levels. tyrosinase from mushrooms has been isolated and investigated in detail up to the level of
intercellular locations, catalytic activities and control mechanisms.
mammalian tyrosinase is found speciﬁcally in melanocytes, which
are highly specialized cells located in the skin, hair bulbs and eyes
which produce pigment [3].
abnormal accumulation of melanin product is responsible for
hyperpigmentation which includes melasma and senile lentigines
and also dermatological disorders such as age spots and freckles
[4]. tyrosinase inhibitors are widely used in dermatological treatments and in cosmetics. tyrosinase inhibitors derived from both
natural and synthetic sources, have been widely investigated in the
literature.

many studies of tyrosinase inhibition have used mushroom
tyrosinase [5]. due to its commercial availability and use in the
preliminary screening of tyrosinase inhibitors, mushroom tyrosinase has been a well suited model for studies on melanogenesis
[6,7]. however, the amino acid sequence identity between human
[8] and mushroom tyrosinase is only 23%. therefore it would be
important to use human tyrosinase for the screening of various
skin-whitening agents. in this article, we report a rapid screening technique for the detection of human tyrosinase inhibitors
using surface plasmon resonance biosensor. tyrosinase inhibitors
towards human tyrosinase at different concentrations were monitored by spr. the sensor was able to detect both inhibitors and
corresponding binding afﬁnity constants were generated after the
analysis. this approach could be used to screen and evaluate the
binding of other tyrosinase inhibitors.

2. materials and methods
2.1. chemicals and reagents
sensor chips series s cm5, n-ethyl-n’-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (edc), n-hydroxysuccinimide (nhs), ethanolamine
hcl, as well as sampling vials, were obtained from ge healthcare
life sciences, sweden. human tyrosinase, (recombinant and histag) (bml-se535-0100) was purchased from enzo life sciences, ny
usa having molecular weight ∼52 kda (sds-page),  xxxg2367xxx

and purity of 85% (sds-page). all other chemicals were from sigma
(st. louis, mo, usa) and himedia india pvt ltd, (mumbai, india) with
highest purity and analytical grade. milli q (milipore, usa) water
was used for preparing buffers and reagents.
2.2. enzyme activity assay
one microgram of human tyrosinase will produce approximately 90 pmol of adduct at 37 ◦ c using 0.5 mm l-tyrosine as
substrate in 50 mm potassium phosphate, ph 7.3, 2% dimethylformamide, 5 mm mbth (3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone)
and monitoring formation of dopachrome-mbth adduct at 484 nm
(␧484 = 22,300 m−1 cm−1 ). we have checked the activity of human
tyrosinase before and after immobilization.
2.3. surface plasmon resonance (spr) studies
spr interaction analyses were performed using a biacore x100
optical biosensor (ge healthcare life sciences, bangalore, india).
spr measurements were carried out in phosphate buffer saline
[0.1 m phosphate buffer with 27 mm kcl and 1.37 m nacl 0.005%
polysorbate 20 ph 7.4], and stock solutions were diluted, in the
same buffer. data was collected with the biacore control software
version 2.0. experiments were performed by monitoring the refractive index changes as a function of time under a constant ﬂow rate
of 45 ␮l/min. the relative amount of inhibitor bound to the tyrosinase was determined by measuring the net increase in refractive
index over time compared to control running buffer. there is an
inline subtraction of reference surface during the run. this change
is usually reported in response units (ru).
2.3.1. enzyme immobilization
human tyrosinase dissolved (50 ␮g ml−1 ) in 0.1 m sodium
acetate buffer ph 4.5 was immobilized to a cm5 chip using amine
coupling. using a ﬂow rate of 10 ␮l min−1 , the surface of ﬂow
cell was activated for 7 min using a 1:1 mixture of 100 mm nethyl-n’-(dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (edc) and 100 mm
n-hydroxysuccinimide (nhs) (both dissolved in water), and subsequently tyrosinase was injected for 7 min over the surface until
a desired immobilization level (binding 1003 ru and 2543 ru
for kinetics) was reached, and residual activated carboxy methyl
groups on the surface were blocked by a 7 min injection of 1 m
ethanolamine, ph 8.5.
2.3.2. screening and kinetic analysis
for this study, one of the ﬂow cell was left untouched (no activation or deactivation performed or blank immobilized) for using as a
reference. different analytes were screened against human tyrosinase; ﬂow rate was maintained constant throughout the kinetics
experiment (45 ␮l/min), contact time and dissociation time was
kept at 120 s and 200 s respectively. selected compounds are low
molecular weight and are water soluble regeneration was carried
out with 10 mm glycine hcl ph 2.5 for 30 sat 30 ␮l/min. kinetics measurements were carried out with various concentrations of
compounds in a multi-cycle kinetics mode. binding responses were
recorded in resonance units at a frequency of 10 hz (increased sensitivity) and were presented as sensorgrams. all experiments were
recorded in triplicates and variations were shown as sd.
2.3.3. data analysis
data analysis was done with biacore x100 evaluation software
version 2.0.1. the reference surface signal was subtracted from
the sensorgrams, correcting for differences in the refractive index
between the running buffer and the sample solutions and any non-

speciﬁc binding. the y-axis of sensorgram was scaled and ﬁt to two
state binding of enzyme/inhibitor so as to facilitate comparison.
2.3.4. in silico docking
in silico docking was used to predict the orientation and contact sites of crocin, curcumin, pyrogallol and tannic acid within
the active site of already reported human tyrosinase available in
protein date bank with id: xxxd2923xxx  (asn260, phe261, ile241 and
his244). we docked the small molecules to the enzyme active
site using autodock 4.0 [9,10]. autodock is an automated procedure for predicting the interaction of ligands with their cognate
macromolecular targets [11]. an ideal procedure should be able to
ﬁnd the global minimum in the interaction energy between the
substrate and the target protein, exploring all available degrees
of freedom for the system. coordinate ﬁles of the macromolecule
as well as the ligand used for autogrid and autodock calculations
were prepared using the program auto dock tools [11]. all water
molecules were removed from the original protein data bank ﬁle.
polar hydrogen atoms were added and kollman charge, atomic
solvation parameters and fragmental volumes were assigned to
the protein using autodock tools (adt). to the protein structure
ﬁle for the unliganded human tyrosinase catalytic domain, polar
hydrogen was added, missing atoms were corrected and atomic
gasteiger charges were calculated and added. using the gridbox
option, the 3-dimensional parameters for docking the ligand to
the protein were determined; to the following grid center coordinates were x = 23.129, y = 101.558, z = 2.507. the grid size was set
´ the maximum number
to 60 × 60 × 60 with grid spacing of 0.375 å.
of energy evaluations were set to 25,00,000. ten runs were carried
out and a maximum number of 27000 lga operations were generated on a single population of 150 individuals. operator weights for
crossover, mutation and elitism were default parameters (0.80, 0.02
and 1 respectively). a total of 10 possible binding conformations
were generated and grouped into clusters based on a2-a cluster
tolerance. the docked ligand output ﬁle was viewed for the conservity of the screened inhibitor binding with the known inhibitor
ptu binding site to  xxxd2923xxx  crystal structure using chimera1.4 (ucsf).
3. results and discussion
tyrosinase and its inhibitors may also be targets for developing medicines to treat hypopigmentation-related problems, such as
albinism and piebaldism [12]. the majority of tyrosinase inhibitors
have been screened using mushroom tyrosinase but, considering
the applications of tyrosinase inhibitors in the medical ﬁeld and
the cosmetics industry primarily to diminish hyperpigmentation;
it is becoming increasingly important to use human tyrosinase for
inhibition studies.
the regulation of melanin synthesis via inhibition of tyrosinase
is a current research topic using human tyrosinase instead of mushroom tyrosinase. much of the research and inhibitor screening has
used mushroom tyrosinase. however, mushroom tyrosinase interacts very differently with substrates and inhibitors compared to
the human enzyme. various tyrosinase-based biosensors have been
developed in the past few years [13–17]. using these sensors, the
detection of the large group of phenolic compounds as tyrosinase
inhibitors was possible using mushroom tyrosinase only. however,
low sensitivity is one of their major drawbacks [18]. in the present
paper, evaluation of different small compounds towards human
tyrosinase using surface plasmon resonance is reported for the ﬁrst
time in our study. different inhibitors such as phenolic compounds
were earlier screened against mushroom tyrosinase [19].
in this study, thirty different molecules were screened and
some of which have previously been identiﬁed as inhibitors for
mushroom tyrosinase. the screening results showed that the afﬁn-

ity towards human tyrosinase varies from molecule to molecule
which is clearly observed from fig. 1. as spr is mass sensitive technique and the correction relative to molecular weight
of compounds has been applied for sensorgrams. many compounds displayed high afﬁnity for tyrosinase but possessed low
stability. compounds with low stability were found to display a
higher dissociation rate. based on binding studies various small
molecules like crocin, curcumin, pyrogallol and tannic acid were
selected further for afﬁnity and kinetic analysis against the human
tyrosinase. all components showed high binding afﬁnity towards
human tyrosinase with kd values for crocin (5.609 × 10−5 m), curcumin (1.522 × 10−3 m), tannic acid (6.458 × 10−5 m) pyrogallol
(1.348 × 10−5 m) and hydroquinone (2.433 × 10−3 m) respectively.
among these, pyrogallol showed higher afﬁnity for enzyme tyrosinase followed by curcumin, tannic acid and crocin. crocin and
curcumin are natural components used in cosmetics for the treatment of hyperpigmentation. the binding kinetics for crocin (fig. 2)
and curcumin (fig. 3) with two-state ﬁt clearly shows conforma-

tional changes as evident from the data on kinetics as shown in
table 1. a slower binding phase indicated by  xxxg961xxx  and kd1 and a
very rapid phase indicated by ka2 and kd2 are observed. binding
kinetics of these molecules followed by conformational change of
mushroom tyrosinase has been well studied in our earlier report
[7,19]. this will be helpful for further comparison and characterization of inhibitors for both tyrosinases. tannic acid and pyrogallol
also showed more afﬁnity for human tyrosinase (figs. 4 and 5)
whereas, positive control hydroquinone showed higher binding
afﬁnity among the others (fig. 6).
the use of screening method to discover new inhibitors is
becoming a common practice in modern drug discovery [20].
receptor-based screens seek to “dock” members of a chemical
library against a given protein structure, predicting the conformation and binding afﬁnity of the small molecules [21]. a large number
of programs are available for this purpose, such as dock [22], flexx
[23], gold [24], and autodock [25–27].

we then carried out docking studies using four
compounds—crocin, curcumin, pyrogallol and tannic acid—as
ligands (fig. 7a–d). all analysis was carried out using autodock 4.0.
1 bug (database pmdb (58): pm0079416) was already reported
for in silico interaction studies of  xxxd2923xxx  as a tyrosinase
inhibitor [28]. docking studies were performed based on the
methods described earlier [9,29,30]. the active site residues were
identiﬁed as histidine 244, isoleucine 241, phenyl alanine 261 and
arginine 260 [9,28]. in assessment using autodock 4.0, using previously reported crystal structure,  xxxd2923xxx , catechol oxidase showed
better afﬁnity compared to other inhibitors. binding energy was
found to increase from curcumin to crocin in accordance with the
observation that afﬁnity increases exactly in the reverse order
(table 2). all molecules had root mean square deviations below
2 å.

information about binding afﬁnity pattern of human tyrosinase
in terms of dissociation constant and on and off rates. crocin,
curcumin, pyrogallol and tannic acid were reported to be having
anti-tyrosinase activity, and showed differences in their binding
afﬁnities for the tyrosinase. hydroquinone is well known inhibitor
of tyrosinase also showed the maximum binding afﬁnity for human
tyrosinase. these molecules could downregulate the activity of
human tyrosinase, which might be directly related to the reduction of pigmentation production. also using this technique one can
determine half life of molecules for human tyrosinase for long term
applications in cosmetics.
