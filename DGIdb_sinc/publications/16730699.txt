abstract
the purpose of the present study was to determine antipsychotic doses that achieve 80% striatal dopamine d2-receptor occupancy for
haloperidol, risperidone and olanzapine in rats. wistar rats were treated with normal saline vehicle (controls), haloperidol (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg/
day), risperidone (3, 5 and 6 mg/kg/day) and olanzapine (5 and 10 mg/kg/day) for 7 days via osmotic minipumps. striatal and cerebellar tissue
were collected and in vivo dopamine d2-receptor occupancies were determined using 3h-raclopride. the doses required to achieve dopamine d2receptor occupancy of 80% in 11- and 24-week old rats were: haloperidol 0.25 mg/kg/day, risperidone 5 mg/kg/day and olanzapine 10 mg/kg/day.

1. introduction
antipsychotic drugs have a significant affinity for dopamine
d2-receptors (seeman, 2002). the therapeutic effects of most
antipsychotic drugs, such as haloperidol, risperidone and
olanzapine, are mediated predominantly by the central blockade
of dopamine d2-receptors (seeman, 2002). moreover, it has
been shown that therapeutic doses are associated with dopamine
d2-receptor occupancy reaching 80% (farde et al., 1988).
hence, the aim of this study was to determine clinically relevant
doses of haloperidol, risperidone and olanzapine in rats. in this
study, in vivo dopamine d2-receptor occupancy by the
antipsychotic drugs was determined using 3h-raclopride (a
substituted benzamide) as the radioligand, because raclopride
has a high affinity and is selective for dopamine d2-receptors
(köhler et al., 1985). this is analogous to other in vivo

methods, such as positron emission tomography (pet), that are
used in human occupancy studies (farde, 1986; lammertsma et
al., 1996). an important issue to consider in animal studies is
the short half-life of antipsychotic drugs in rats compared with
humans (table 1). in order to achieve dopamine d2-receptor
occupancy in the clinically relevant range throughout the
duration of treatment with the drugs in this study, steady-state
drug levels were achieved in the rats by using subcutaneous
continuous infusion minipumps for 7 days.
2. materials and methods
2.1. animals
adult male wistar rats were divided into two groups, 11week old and 24-week old animals. all animals were housed in
groups of two per cage in a temperature-controlled room (25 °c)
with a 12-h light/dark cycle. food and water were available ad
libitum. animals were weighed weekly and their behaviour was

2.2. drugs and chemicals
haloperidol (sigma pharmaceuticals, melbourne, vic,
australia) and olanzapine (gift from eli lilly, sydney, nsw,
australia) were dissolved in normal saline (0.9% nacl) and
risperidone (gift from janssen-cilag, sydney, nsw, australia)
was dissolved in 1% acetic acid. all drugs were administered by
alzet osmotic minipumps at a rate of 10.0 mul/h (model 2ml1,
bioscientific, sydney, nsw, australia). 3h-raclopride (specific
activity 2224 mbq/mumol; perkinelmer life sciences, boston,
ma, usa) was used as the competitive dopamine d2-receptor
antagonist.

spectrometry, using a packard liquid scintillation counter
(perkinelmer life sciences).
2.5. determination of dopamine d2-receptor occupancy
dopamine d2-receptor binding occupancy was determined
using the cerebellum as a reference tissue that does not contain
specific binding sites (lammertsma et al., 1996; lammertsma
and hume, 1996). specific binding was obtained for each
animal as the difference between radioactivity of the striatum
and cerebellum. 3h determinations in striatal and cerebellar
samples were obtained and expressed as dpm/mg tissue weight.
dopamine d2-receptor occupancy was determined using the
following equations, which are valid under the conditions used,
i.e. tracer amount of 125 pmol 3h-raclopride per rat (wadenberg
et al., 2000; laruelle, 2000):

2.6. statistical analysis of data
2.3. surgical procedure
rats underwent surgery for implantation of an alzet osmotic
minipump. rats were anesthetized using halothane before
surgery. a small incision was made on the back and pumps were
inserted into the subcutaneous space. eleven-week old animals
(279 ± 6.9 g; n = 39) received pump delivery of haloperidol (0.25
and 0.5 mg/kg), risperidone (3, 5 and 6 mg/kg), olanzapine (5
and 10 mg/kg) or normal saline (0.9% nacl) for 7 days. these
doses were selected using data published by an independent
study (kapur et al., 2003) and our preliminary data. twentyfour week old animals (591 ± 12 g; n = 16) received pump
delivery of 0.25 mg/kg/day haloperidol, 5 mg/kg/day risperidone, 10 mg/kg/day olanzapine, or normal saline (0.9% nacl)
for 7 days.
2.4. in vivo radioligand binding
thirty minutes before sacrifice, all animals received an
intravenous injection of 3h-raclopride (7.5 muci/rat, in a volume
of 0.4 ml of normal saline; 125 pmol 3h-raclopride per rat) via
the lateral tail vein. all rats were sacrificed by decapitation.
brains were immediately removed, and the left and right striata
(for determination of specific binding) and the cerebellum (for
determination of non-specific binding) were isolated. tissue
samples were weighed and placed in 20 ml glass scintillation
vials. the collected tissue samples were dissolved with 2 ml of
solvable (perkinelmer life sciences) and gently shaken for
24 h. thereafter, 10 ml of aquasure liquid scintillant
(perkinelmer life sciences) was added and allowed to mix
for a further 24 h. 3h was determined by liquid scintillation

data were analyzed using graphpad prism software
(graphpad, san diego, usa) and graphpad instat (graphpad).
in all experiments, data were expressed as means ± sem. onefactor analysis of variance (anova), followed by tukey post
hoc tests, was used to compare the effects of the various doses
of the three drugs used in the 11-week old animals. the effects
of single doses of the three drugs in 11-week old animals were
compared with 24-week old animals by 2-factor anova. one
sample t-tests were used to determine whether the dopamine d2receptor occupancies for specific doses of any given drug were
significantly greater than 65% or less than 80%.
3. results
an in vivo dopamine d2-receptor occupancy method, using
h-raclopride binding, was used to establish doses for
haloperidol, risperidone and olanzapine to give receptor
occupancy values in the range of 65–80% in 11-week and
24-week old male wistar rats. 3h-raclopride binding in the
striatum of the saline treated control animals was 59.7 ±
9.1 fmol/g for 11-week old animals (n = 6) and 47.7 ± 5.0 fmol/g
for 24-week old animals (n = 4). these values are significantly
greater than the non-specific 3h-raclopride binding measured in
samples of cerebellum from the same animals (10.9 ± 0.5 fmol/g
for 11-week old animals, p < 0.01, and 11.0 ± 1.6 fmol/g for
24-week old animals p < 0.01; paired t-test).
in 11-week old rats, there were significant differences
between the dopamine- xxxg656xxx  occupancy values for the
three drugs (haloperidol, risperidone and olanzapine) at the
doses tested (one-factor anova, p < 0.001). subsequent post

hoc tests, showed that: (i) the effects of haloperidol at
0.5 mg/kg/day and 0.25 mg/kg/day were not significantly
different (p > 0.05); (ii) risperidone had a significantly greater
effect at 6 mg/kg/day than at 3 mg/kg/day (p < 0.05), but there
was no difference between the effects at 5 and 6 mg/kg/day
(p > 0.05); (iii) olanzapine had a significantly greater effect at
10 mg/kg/day than at 5 mg/kg/day (p < 0.001). haloperidol at
0.25 mg/kg/day and 0.5 mg/kg/day, risperidone at 5 mg/kg/
day and 6 mg/kg/day and olanzapine  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg/day resulted
in dopamine d2-receptor occupancies that were not significantly different from 80% (p > 0.05, one sample t-tests). the
doses that were selected for further studies were: 0.25 mg/kg/
day for haloperidol, 5 mg/kg/day for risperidone and 10 mg/
kg/day for olanzapine, at which there were no statistically
significant differences in dopamine d2-receptor occupancy
values for the three drugs (p > 0.05, post hoc tests).
experiments were also carried out with 24-week old male
wistar rats using the doses of haloperidol, risperidone and
olanzapine that were established in the study using 11-week
old rats. these further experiments were carried out to verify
the effectiveness of these doses in mature rats. the data for
the 24-week old rats (fig. 1) showed that haloperidol
(0.25 mg/kg/day), risperidone (5 mg/kg/day) and olanzapine
(10 mg/kg/day) all resulted in dopamine d2-receptor occupancy values that were significantly greater than 65%
(p < 0.05, one sample t-tests) and not significantly different
from 80% (p > 0.05, one sample t-tests). there were also no
significant differences between the occupancies for the three

drugs at these dosage levels (p > 0.05, 2-factor anova). the
dopamine d2-receptor occupancy values for each drug were
not statistically significantly different in 24-week old rats
compared with 11-week old rats (p > 0.05, 2-factor anova).
4. discussion
the aim of this study was to determine clinically relevant
doses of haloperidol, risperidone and olanzapine that achieve
levels of striatal dopamine d2-receptor occupancy of 80% in
rats, using an in vivo radioligand binding method. our results
indicated that in 11-week and 24-week old male wistar rats 65%
to 80% dopamine d2-receptor occupancy is achieved with
haloperidol at 0.25 mg/kg/day, risperidone at 5 mg/kg/day and
olanzapine  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg/day.
previous studies that have determined dopamine d2receptor occupancy in rats include those by sumiyoshi et al.
(1994), schotte et al. (1996), zhang and bymaster (1999),
kapur et al. (2003) and assié et al. (2005). the variability in
results between these studies could be a consequence of the
strain of rat used in the study, the route and frequency of
administration of the antipsychotic drugs and/or the method of
determining dopamine d2-receptor occupancy. the in vitro
method of determining dopamine d2-receptor occupancy used
by schotte et al. (1996) is more variable and less sensitive
compared with the in vivo method (kapur et al., 2001) used in
this study. another confounding factor is that the radioligand
was administered subcutaneously in some in vivo dopamine
d2-receptor occupancy studies, such as zhang and bymaster
(1999), whereas intravenous administration of the radioligand
as used in this study allows equilibrium concentrations at the
dopamine d2-receptors to be reached more rapidly. previous
studies, except kapur et al. (2003), also used single doses of
antipsychotic drugs, and hence do not provide an indication of
the dopamine d2-receptor occupancy achieved with chronic
dosing. since it is known that most antipsychotics have a halflife averaging between 4 to 6 times less in rats than in humans
(table 1), the continual presence of the antipsychotic drug at
therapeutically active levels was achieved in the present study
and that of kapur et al. (2003) by chronic dosing of rats using
osmotic minipumps. it has been shown that, in the case of
antipsychotics, although plasma concentrations decline with
time after single dose administration, brain dopamine d2receptors are occupied to a greater extent than indicated by
their plasma levels (tauscher et al., 2002). hence, it is highly
likely that, because of the longer half-life of the drugs in
human patients, the dopamine d2-receptor occupancy by the
drugs will be maintained at levels in the therapeutic range of
80% in the clinical situation. this was modelled in the present
study by continuous minipump infusion of antipsychotic
drugs.
we required dopamine d2-receptor occupancy data for
subsequent studies on the chronic effects of antipsychotic drugs
in wistar rats. the study conducted by kapur et al. (2003) is the
most comparable to the present study, but sprague–dawley rats
were used. the results from the present study compared with
that of kapur et al. (2003) showed that the doses of haloperidol

and olanzapine to achieve 65% to 80% dopamine d2-receptor
occupancy were unaffected by the strain of rat or age.
pet studies on dopamine d2-receptor occupancy by
antipsychotic drugs in humans provide comparable data to in
vivo dopamine d2-receptor occupancy determinations in animal
studies, and both methods are dependent on use of an
appropriate radioligand. a long-standing problem in pet
studies has been that butyrophenones (such as spiperone) and
benzamides (such as raclopride) yield significantly different
densities for dopamine d2-receptor binding sites (seeman et al.,
1992). more specifically, it was shown that benzamides label
30% to 100% more dopamine d2-receptor binding sites than
butyrophenones (seeman et al., 1992). this difference can be
explained by 3h-spiperone labelling monomers, while 3hraclopride labels both dimers and monomers (inoue et al., 1999;
zawarynski et al., 1998; seeman et al., 1992). hence, the
density of 3h-raclopride-labelled sites would be expected to
exceed the density of 3h-spiperone-labelled sites (inoue et al.,
1999; zawarynski et al., 1998; seeman et al., 1992) and is a
better reflection of the density of total dopamine d2-receptor
binding sites (inoue et al., 1999). another difference between
3
h-spiperone and 3 h-raclopride is the lack of receptor
specificity for the former ligand. for instance, it was shown
that 3h-raclopride has a high affinity and selectivity for
dopamine d2-receptors, whereas 3h-spiperone binds to both
dopamine d2-receptors and serotonin 5-ht2-receptors (farde et
al., 1985; köhler et al., 1985). another possible explanation for
different dopamine d2-receptor occupancies obtained with the
different radioligands might be that 3h-raclopride has a shorter
dissociation half-time in comparison to 3h-spiperone in the
striatum (inoue et al., 1999; bischoff and gunst, 1997; köhler
et al., 1985), so that much shorter equilibration times are
required when 3h-raclopride is used as the radioligand. taken
together, these factors led us to the conclusion that 3hraclopride is a more suitable ligand for the study of dopamine
d2-receptor occupancy than 3h-spiperone. in addition, the
present study examined dopamine d2-receptor occupancy of
typical and atypical antipsychotics and hence required a ligand
that was highly selective for dopamine d2-receptors only. the
dose-occupancy results of the present study in rats may only be
comparable to dose-occupancy results from human pet studies
using raclopride as the radioligand.
in conclusion, using an in vivo receptor occupancy method
to determine antipsychotic doses in animal studies that achieves
80% dopamine d2-receptor occupancy level provides a
rationale for selecting doses that are comparable to those
determined in clinical settings by pet studies using benzamide
radioligands.
