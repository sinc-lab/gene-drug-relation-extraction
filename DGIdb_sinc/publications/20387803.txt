tethered receptors by fluorescence polarization
and total internal reflection fluorescence

binding kinetics of nuclear receptors and their specific
ligands was measured using polarization anisotropy
complemented with total internal reflection fluorescence.
binding affinities of tethered full length human estrogen
receptor alpha (err) with 17beta-estradiol, diethylstilbestrol, raloxifene, 4- xxxd91xxx , tamoxifen, and
genistein were measured to be 100 (as reference), 100,
35, 21, 8, and 1.5, respectively. they agreed with
published results. for the first time, rate constants were
measured, and off rates were 1.5, 1.5, 1.3, 1.6, 1.7, and
2.3 × 10-3 s-1 while on rates were 11, 10, 3.3, 2.4,
1.0, and 0.26 × 105 m-1s-1, respectively. for the
antiestrogen drugs, their comparable off-rates correlated well with their equally similar potency. eleven
ginsenosides were screened as potential ligands. none
were found to bind to err, but rb1(s) and 20(s)-rg3
were shown to bind to  xxxg1807xxx . the latter finding corroborated
strongly with the therapeutic effects of ginsenosides on
diabetic mice observed in a separate study. our
method would complement surface plasmon resonance
assay for small ligands in the mass range of tens to
hundreds of daltons.
numerous physiological processes are mediated by receptorligand interactions. one example is the binding of estrogens with
their receptors. this can lead to the proliferation of cancerous
mammary cells. consequently, antagonist drugs were developed
which could compete with endogenous hormones for the receptor
site.1 another example is the binding of hormone receptors with
certain environmental contaminants. this can disrupt endocrine
functions to cause health problems.2 one therefore wants to
measure the binding between receptors and ligands, be it for lead
optimization in drug discovery, or for large scale screening of
endocrine disruptors. specifically, equilibrium and kinetic rate
constants of receptor-ligand interaction are to be measured in
vitro.3,4

these binding constants may be measured by radioisotope
or optical assays.5 for safety reasons, the latter is preferred.
in these studies, the reagents are mixed in solution and kinetics
is studied by stopped-flow. more recently, however, tethered
receptors in flow cells are used because this format uses less
chemicals, allows reagent injection amidst reactions, and can
be parallel-processed like microarrays for high throughput
screening. examples of this format include the widely adopted
surface plasmon resonance (spr) and the newer reflectance
interferometry.6,7 they detect optical changes due to the
increase in mass. no analyte labeling is necessary. for small
ligands like estrogens (272 d), nonetheless, the minute mass
increase can evade detection. that probably explains why only
leading spr experts had measured estrogen binding kinetics.8
if still smaller ligands are to be studied, as in fragment-based
drug discovery,9 spr will be seriously handicapped.
fluorescence based techniques can be more sensitive. for
example, total-internal-reflection fluorescence (tirf) can detect
single fluorophores.10 it has been used by itself,11 and in combination with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy,12 and photobleaching recovery,13 to measure affinities and kinetics of
receptor-ligand interactions. we have previously used tirf to
measure the adsorption kinetics of single molecules of bovine
 xxxg124xxx .14,15 another useful technique is fluorescence
polarization (fp). it detects the fluorescence anisotropy of small
fluorescent ligands whose tumbling is slowed when they bind to
protein receptors.10 although dye labeling is a concern in these

fp has been widely used to measure receptor-ligand interactions at equilibrium,2 as well as binding kinetics in stopped-flow
mixing.18,19 as far as we know, it has not been used to measure
binding kinetics of tethered receptors. here, we report the design
and implementation of an fp-tirf system for measuring the
binding kinetics of small ligands with tethered receptors. we will
show that our method was reliable, and it complemented spr in
many ways. we report, for the first time, the rate constants of
the binding of full-length human  xxxg730xxx  alpha (err)
with its standard ligands. our measured affinities agreed with
published results. the antiestrogen drugs that we studied were
shown to have dissimilar affinities. yet their comparable off-rates
correlated with their equally similar potency in reducing breast
cancer. we also screened ginsenosides for binding with err and
 xxxg1807xxx  ( xxxg1807xxx ). high
affinity ligands were identified, which corroborated the therapeutic
effects of ginsenosides on diabetic mice demonstrated in a
separate study.

underside, filled with buffer, sandwiched with a cover glass c,
and sealed with vacuum grease g. liquid inlet and outlet were
inserted from the top. the cell was clamped onto the traveling
stage and coupled via immersion oil o to a prism p that was fixed
relative to the microscope stand. the cell could freely translate
without moving the prism. a 473-nm laser beam was split two
ways with a beam splitter bs. one beam was focused with lens l
and incident through the prism on the quartz-water interface at
70° and was totally reflected internally to produce the tirf signal.
the evanescent layer was about 100 nm thick.15 the other beam
was steered with mirrors m and incident through the prism on
the quartz-water interface at 41° to produce the bulk fluorescence
bf signal. the incident laser beam was te polarized (s-wave)
and the laser power of the two arms was balanced with a neutral
density filter ndf. fluorescence signal was collected by a 10×
na 0.25 microscope objective mo, band-filtered f, and directed
through a polarizing beamsplitter pb. the dual images were
captured with an electron-multiplied ccd (emccd). part c is a
typical image. the four spots from top to bottom were bf|, tirf|,

poly-l-lysine (pll) was adsorbed electrostatically on negatively
charged quartz (q). second, a primary antibody (igg) was bonded
covalently to pll. third, igg then captured a secondary antibody

the sample preparation are given in the supporting information.
data capture. a kinetics run usually consisted of fast
(seconds) and slow (minutes) events. slow events were recorded
on 2-s long movies taken at 1 min intervals, at 5 hz frame rate. if
spatial averaging was needed, the slide would be translated and
10 or more such movie segments would be taken in prompt
succession. to capture fast events, such as the influx of the
fluorescent reporter ligands f and their binding with and dissociation from receptors, 30 s movies of the same spot were taken
at 5 hz frame rate. slight photobleaching could have occurred.
its extent was gauged by comparison with neighboring nonirradiated spots. movies in tif format were processed by a matlab
program in real time. the program summed 10 successive frames
and calculated the average brightness over user-defined areas
such as the four spots shown in figure 1c as well as peripheral
areas that served as background. the tirf and fp traces were
displayed as the reaction progressed. at the end of a data run,
the data traces in text format and the raw tif file were stored for
off-line processing and analysis.

fluorescence anisotropy. our kinetics analysis was based
on measuring the fluorescence anisotropy of f. the anisotropy

measuring a at that instant. the second was based on mixing f
with excess err in solution in a peg-coated channel. all results
were found to be consistent and the value of a and ā were about
80 and 320 ma, respectively. we will show in a later section that
even for tethered err, µ of bound f was oriented randomly. we
could therefore make use of eqs 1-3 to determine f(t) from
measured a(t).
kinetics modeling. when f was flowed onto tethered err,
the time rate of change of the surface density of the receptor-f
complex [rf]• would be given by3
•

[rf] ) kon[f]([r]total - [rf]) - koff[rf]

(4)

where [f] was the concentration of free f in solution, [r]total was
the surface density of apo and complexed receptors, and kon
and koff were the respective on and off rate constants. expressing eq 4 in terms of the bound fraction f, we have
•

f ) kon(1 - f )(ftotal - f [f]total) - koff f

(5)

where ftotal was the equivalent volume concentration if all the
tethered receptors were dissolved in solution, and [f]total was
the equivalent volume concentration of free and complexed f.
by solving eq 5 numerically to best fit the measured f(t), we could
determine the three unknowns, ftotal and the two rate constants.
we assumed that the mixing of free f in the solution was rapid,
so that [f] was homogeneous throughout. this so-called rapid
mixing assumption will be justified in the next section.21
to model the competition between a dark ligand l and the
reporter ligand f, eq 5 had to be modified to two coupled
differential equations17
•

where i| and i⊥ are the bulk fluorescence intensities of f with
polarization parallel and perpendicular to the incident polarization, respectively, and itotal is the total fluorescence intensity.
values of a are usually reported in ma, where 1 ma ) 10-3 a.

in the last equation, a is the minimum a value of 100% free f,
and ā is the maximum a value of 100% bound f. we generated
100% free f by two independent methods: (1) by mixing f with a
huge excess of a competitor ligand,20 and (2) by flowing f into a
sample channel coated with  xxxd2982xxx  (peg). we
produced 100% bound f again by two independent means. the
first was by allowing f to bind to tethered err, waiting until
equilibrium, and then promptly flushing out all free f and
(20) we typically mixed 1 nm f with 20 µm of the competitor ligand. the
competitor ligand was either e2 or des. their dissociation constants were
1.4 nm (see table 1).

where variables with tildes were the l analogs of f. in contrast
to [f]total, [l]total could not be measured because l was not
fluorescent. instead, it was determined from dilution ratios
based on the known concentration of the stock. for that reason,
extra care was taken when preparing and diluting the stock.
this was explained in the supporting information. the five
unknowns, ftotal and the four rate constants in eqs 6 and 7, could
be determined by solving the coupled differential equations
numerically to best fit the measured f(t).
rapid mixing assumption. to determine if diffusive mixing
is rapid enough or not, we can consider the number of f molecules
dissociated from unit area of tethered receptors in time tau, where
tau is the time for a free f to diffuse half the height h of the sample
channel. we use half height because there were tethered receptors
on the quartz slide as well as on the coverglass. tau is therefore
given by tau ) (h2)/(8d) where d is the diffusion constant of
free f.

figure 2. err-f binding kinetics. the bound fraction of f as deduced from fluorescence anisotropy was plotted against time as different
reagents were injected at various time points. at time t ) 0, 10 µl of 3 nm f was injected into the sample to replace the initial blank buffer, and
the bound fraction was plotted (o). at t ) 300 s, 15 µl of blank buffer was injected, and the equilibrated bound fraction was shown (4). the last
step was repeated at t ) 600 s, and the equilibrated bound fraction was plotted (+). at t ) 900 s, 10 µl of 3 nm f was injected and the
equilibrated bound fraction was plotted (0). at t ) 1200 s, 15 µl of 20 µm e2 was injected, and the subsequent dissociation of f from err was
shown ( ×). the steady-state signal shown was the average over 10 or more neighboring spots on the sample slide. the standard deviation
was about the size of the data symbols. the kinetic rate constants could be determined by best-fitting the experimental data points (bold curves).
misfits were also shown: 50% higher koff (curves labeled d), 50% lower koff (curves labeled c), and both koff and kon 50% higher (curves a and
f) and 50% lower (curves b and e).

if the ratio is much less than 1, mixing is rapid enough.
for association events, one can derive in a similar fashion the
criteria for rapid mixing. we also checked the validity of eq 8 by
numerically solving the hydrodynamics equations subject to
appropriate boundary conditions.21 the result supported the
conclusion drawn from eq 8 (ref 22).
results and discussion
tether characterization. because of the fragility of the
 xxxg730xxx  and the stringent requirement of polarization
assays,10,23 we had to experiment with numerous tethering
schemes, from simple physisorption, through covalent bonding,23
to antibody capture.24 we finally adopted the scheme depicted in
figure 1b. we tested the strength and specificity of the tethering
chain. each link was found to withstand multiple flushes of buffer
and reagents. the antibody bridge was shown to be specific: the
surface coverage of err dropped 18-fold if abr was absent
(figure s1, supporting information). we used a green fluorescent
ligand f ( xxxd1853xxx  es2, invitrogen) as the reporter in kinetic
studies. the binding of f to the channel surface was shown to be

extremely specific as well: when 1 nm f was flowed into errcoated channels, about 60% were bound; when err was absent,
the bound fraction dropped to practically zero (figure s2).
we then enquired if tethering would affect receptor functions.
we found that, for our tethered err, agonist (17beta-estradiol) bound
ones recruited 18 times more coactivator than apo ones or antagonist
( xxxd38xxx ) bound ones (figure s3), as expected of a
functional err. we also showed that tethering did not affect the
binding kinetics of err-f. this will be elaborated later.
we last checked the orientation of the dipole µ of bound f.
during their brief fluorescence lifetime, each µ was effectively
frozen in space. yet they were shown to be pointing just as
randomly, were they bound to receptors in solution or receptors
tethered on the quartz slide (figure s4). the polarization anisotropy a ()(i| - i⊥)/(itotal)) could thus be readily converted to
bound fraction of f.
binding kinetics of green  xxxd1853xxx  f. the binding
kinetics of analyte (nonlabeled) ligands was deduced from their
displacement of the reporter ligand f. for that reason, the rate
constants of f had to be measured first. we did a preliminary
study by flowing f onto tethered err, waiting until steady state,
and displacing the bound f with a high concentration of 4- xxxd91xxx  (4oht). the result is shown in figure 1a, where
anisotropy a (o) and the tirf signal (4) are plotted against time.
experimental conditions are described in the figure caption. as
can be seen, the two sets of data were very consistent. the
anisotropy a, however, could give the absolute bound fraction (eq
3) while tirf would only give the relative population of surfacebound fluorophores. therefore, in our finalized experimental
design, we measured the kinetics by fp. the tirf data were used
for consistency checks.
the results of a typical kinetics run are shown in figure 2.
the experimental conditions are given in the caption. briefly, at

t ) 0, f was injected into a sample channel of tethered err. flow
was promptly ceased, and binding occurred in a static cell
environment during the next 300 s. blank buffer or f was then
injected a few more times, when new steady states were generated
each time. at t ) 1200 s, excess 17beta-estradiol was injected to
completely displace all bound f.
with reference to figure 2, the simulation of the empirical data
was done in four steps. first, the off-rate was easily found because
the decay beyond 1200 s was due solely to dissociation of f.
rebinding was prevented by excess e2. second, the receptor
coverage and the equilibrium dissociation constant kd () koff/
kon) were determined by fitting the four steady-state bound
fractions between 100 and 1000 s. four steady-state values
overdetermined the two unknowns to allow parameter optimization and consistency checks. third, we used the determined
rate constants and receptor coverage to generate the association curve. the transient influx of f near t ) 0, as measured
by itotal(t), was taken into account in the simulation (figure
s8). as there were no free parameters, the excellent match to
the experimental data lent confidence to the model. four, we
finally optimized the three parameters to best fit all data points.
the best fit is shown in figure 2 (bold solid curves), which
yielded both the on and off rates. the sensitivity of the fit to
parameter values was also examined. a 50% higher koff visibly
underestimated the equilibrated bound fractions (light curves
labeled d) while a 50% lower koff overestimated them (light
curves labeled c). if both koff and kon were 50% higher, the f
signal would increase too fast (light curve a) and decay too
soon (light curve f). the exact opposite would occur if both
rate constants were 50% lower than the best-fit values (light
curves b and e).
multiple sets of rate constants were found from fitting more
than 10 sets of data. to test reproducibility, these data sets were
captured using different sample cells in experiments performed
in different sessions, even on different days. the averaged rate
constants are given in table 1 (first row). the standard deviations
are shown as uncertainties. as can be seen, the uncertainties were
within 20%.

rate constants were also measured in peg-coated channels
when receptor-ligand interactions occurred in solution. the on
and off rates were found by fp to be 6.8 × 107 m-1 s-1 and 2.5 ×
10-2 s-1, respectively. the relative uncertainty was about 20%.
their agreement with those of tethered err, to within
experimental error (see table 1), indicated that tethering did
not affect the binding kinetics.
from the best fit, the receptor coverage was found to be about
30 molecules µm-2. at this low coverage, the perturbation in
local [f] due to binding with or dissociation from tethered err
was less than 2% (eq 8). this justified the assumption of rapid
mixing.
binding kinetics of nonfluorescent ligands. the binding
kinetics of a dark ligand l was determined by its competitive
displacement of the reporter f. the result of a typical experiment
is shown in figure 3 when the dark ligand genistein was used.
the measured bound fractions are plotted as data points (o, 4,
×, and 0). the experimental conditions are given in the caption.
with reference to figure 3, the experimental data were fitted
as follows. first, the rate constants of err-f interaction and the
receptor coverage were found by fitting the initial 600 s of data.
values of the rate constants should be the same as those gotten
previously (see table 1, first row). once this consistency was
checked, the final dissociation phase was fitted in two steps to
determine the rate constants of l. in step one, the steady-state
bound fraction at t ) 1200 s was fitted to give (k̃off)/(k̃on). in step
two, the shape of the dissociation curve (600 s < t < 1000 s)
was fitted to give k̃off and k̃on.
the best fit is shown in figure 3 (bold solid curves). the on
and off rates k̃on and k̃off of l were hence determined. tolerance
in the fitted values is again illustrated in the figure.
multiple sets of rate constants of genistein were gotten from
fitting three sets of data. these data sets were again captured in
different sessions. the averaged rate constants are given in table
1. the standard deviations are shown as uncertainties. besides
genistein, five other standard ligands of err were studied. they

figure 3. err-genistein binding kinetics. the bound fraction of f
as deduced from anisotropy a was plotted against time while different
reagents were injected at various time points. at t ) 0, 10 µl of 1 nm
f was flowed into the sample cell (o). at t ) 300 s, another 10 µl of
1 nm f was flowed in, and the equilibrated bound fraction was shown
(4). at t ) 600 s, 15 µl of 1 µm genistein was flowed in, and the
subsequent dissociation of f from err was shown ( ×). at t ) 1200 s,
15 µl of 10 µm e2 was flowed in to generate the baseline (0). the
error bar of the steady-state signal was about the size of the data
symbols. for the data shown, photobleaching was found to be
negligible. the rate constants of the err-f binding kinetics could be
determined by best-fitting the experimental data points for t < 600 s
(bold curves). for the err-genistein complex, the rate constants
could be determined by best-fitting the remaining experimental data
points (bold decay curve). misfits were also shown: 50% higher koff
(curve labeled d), 50% lower koff (curve c), and both koff and kon 50%
higher (curve b) and 50% lower (curve a).

4- xxxd91xxx  (4oht), and tamoxifen. they were chosen
because they were standard ligands of err or approved antiestrogen drugs. their measured rate constants are listed in table
1. the uncertainties were based on three or more data sets. they
were mostly within 30%.
as far as we know, the values of the kinetic rate constants
listed in table 1 were known only for the first time. to date, none
were reported in the literature. the nearest that we could find
were rate constants measured by rich et al. 2002 (ref 8), but they
used the ligand binding domain (lbd) of err while we used full
length receptors. their results are also given in table 1 for easy
comparison. as could be seen, except for e2, the rate constants
differed very significantly.
later on, we will comment on the discrepancy. here, it is useful
to point out that equilibrium binding affinity data were available
in the literature. they were usually reported in terms of relative
binding affinity (rba) of err-l relative to err-e2.2 it could be
computed once the dissociation constant kl was known (see
supporting information). the computed values are listed in table
1.
rba values were reported by numerous other groups. among
them, we selected those studies when full length human err was
assayed by fluorescence polarization (herr-fp).2,25–27 we averaged the reported values and computed their standard deviations.
the results are also tabulated in table 1 for easy comparison. as
could be seen, our rba values were consistent with the reported
ones. for the case of raloxifene, only one herr-fp result was
available.27 we therefore quoted the results of radio-assays
performed on full length human err as well.28–30
we could also compute the rba values based on the results
of rich in 2002 (ref 8). these are shown in table 1. they were
very different from the other reported values. rich in 2002 used

spr to assay the binding of err(lbd) with its ligands while all
the others used fp to study full length err. that might explain
the difference.
all the known err ligands that we have studied did bind to
err and competed with f for err. in other words, all the positive
results that we saw were true positives. we also checked for false
negatives. we tested dexamethasone and testosterone which were
known to be non err ligands. no binding was detected (figure
s5).
from table 1, interesting pharmacological implications could
be drawn. the relative binding affinities of the ligands ranged
from 1.5 to 100, but the off-rates only varied from 1.3 × 10-3 s-1
to 2.3 × 10-3 s-1 (see table 1). if off-rates correlated better with
in vivo downstream effects than binding affinities,4 we would
expect similar potency for these ligands. this was indeed the case
for tamoxifen and raloxifene. from table 1, raloxifene would bind
4 times stronger than tamoxifen, but the two drugs were shown
to reduce breast cancer risk by about the same factor when they
were administered at comparable dosage.31 admittedly, a 4-fold
difference in affinity may be too small to be clinically significant,
but it illustrates how our technique can be applied to study the
correlation between off-rate and drug potency.
screening ginsenosides for binding with nuclear receptors. as mentioned, our fp-tirf method could be used to screen
potential ligands of the tethered receptor. we screened a total of
11 ginsenosides for binding with tethered err. they were rb1(s),
20(r)-rg3, 20(s)-rg3, 20(r)-rh2, 20(s)-rh2, rg1, re, ppt, ppd,
ck, and f1. they were chosen because of their steroidlike
properties.32 each ginsenoside at high concentration (10-50 µm)
was flowed onto tethered err-f complex, and the displacement
of f was monitored. all 11 ginsenosides were screened 3 times.
no measurable binding of any of the ginsenosides with err was
observed (figure s6). the null results were double-checked using
fluorescence polarization assays in solution.22 the two results
agreed.
using the fp-tirf system, we screened the same 11 ginsenosides for binding with surface-immobilized  xxxg1807xxx  (lbd).
 xxxg1807xxx  was chosen because it was recently implicated in the
antidiabetic effects of ginsenosides.33,34 to immobilize this receptor, we found that it could be physisorbed firmly on pll-coated
surfaces. the tethering procedure was therefore simplified.
binding was measured by tirf. only two ginsenosides, rb1(s)
and 20(s)-rg3, showed measurable binding to  xxxg1807xxx  (figure s7).
we then double-checked the reliability of the screening results
by repeating the experiment but with the  xxxg1807xxx  (lbd) captured
by a surface-immobilized antibody specific for the receptor.22
this time, we used fp to measure the binding. results are shown
in figure 4. clearly, the same conclusion could be drawn. both
the positive and negative results were double-checked using
fluorescence polarization assays in solution.22 the two results
agreed.

figure 4. screening ginsenosides for binding with antibody-captured
 xxxg1807xxx . tethered  xxxg1807xxx  was first complexed with f. a 10 µm
sample of a ginsenoside was injected into the sample channel at time
t ) 0, and fluorescence anisotropy was measured for the next 300 s
and converted to bound f fraction. the cell was refreshed by flushing
with blank buffer. the injection-wash cycle was repeated with a new
ginsenoside each time. results of three ginsenosides were shown:
rb1 (4), 20(s)-rg3 (o), and 20(r)-rg3 ( ×). blank buffer was used
as negative control (]). as positive control, a  xxxg1807xxx  standard ligand
 xxxd1216xxx   xxxd1891xxx  µm was injected in the last round to determine the
minimum anisotropy (b).

the therapeutic effects of ginsenosides on diabetic mice had
since been investigated by our collaborators, and very interesting
results that corroborated strongly with our findings were observed.35
our fast screen results may also help to relate the ligand
structure with its function. for instance, the absence of the
aromatic a-ring might be a possible explanation for nonbinding
with err,36 and the orientation of the hydroxyl group on the chiral
carbon (c-20) and the sugar moiety at c-3 might be decisive for
binding with  xxxg1807xxx .
conclusion
we reported a method to measure the binding kinetics of
tethered nuclear receptors with their specific ligands. it was based
on fp anisotropy of a fluorescent reporter ligand that competed
with the analyte ligands. the same apparatus also measured the
tirf signal of surface-bound reporter ligands.
our method gave reliable results based on straightforward data
analysis. the data interpretation was clean because the tethering
scheme preserved the random pointing of the reporter dipole. this
simplified the data analysis. at the same time, the sensitive

detection tolerated low receptor coverage which in turn justified
position-independent kinetics modeling. when the receptor coverage was high, as in the case of spr, elaborate models would be
needed.21 the data accuracy was checked by the consistency of
the fp and the tirf signals. the model validity was ensured by
the satisfactory fit to empirical data. the very good agreement
between our measured affinities and those reported in the
literature speaks for the reliability of our results.
our method also saved money and time. the setup was
inexpensive: the entire apparatus cost less than 20 000 usd if the
electron-multiplied ccd (emccd) was replaced with photomultiplier tubes. an emccd was used to locate areas-of-interest on
the image. for mature setups, however, this will not be necessary.
the recurrent cost was low: our sample cell could be easily
fabricated and disassembled for cleaning and recycling, and only
tens of femtomoles of the reporter ligand were needed as opposed
to the picomoles required in conventional fp assays. the
measurement was fast: the screening of 11 ginsenosides took less
than 2 h, and the rate constants for an analyte ligand could be
determined in less than 30 min.
yet more importantly, we believe our method is presently the
only nonradioisotope assay that can reliably measure the kinetic
rate constants of receptors interacting with small (101-102 d)
ligands. realizing that receptor-ligand interaction is the
primary step in chemical signaling on the one hand, and
fluorescent ligands are becoming readily available on the
other,37 the application horizon is vast.
