late-onset alzheimer’s disease is often
connected with nutritional misbalance, such as enhanced
cholesterol intake, deficiency in polyunsaturated fatty
acids, or hypovitaminosis. the ␣-secretase adam10 has
been found to be regulated by  xxxd3417xxx , the bioreactive metabolite of  xxxd3105xxx . here we show that retinoids
induce gene expression of adam10 and ␣-secretase
activity by nonpermissive retinoid acid receptor/retinoid
x receptor (rar/rxr) heterodimers, whereby ␣- and
␤-isotypes of rar play a major role. however, ligands of
other rxr binding partners, such as the vitamin d
receptor, do not stimulate ␣-secretase activity. on the
basis of these findings, we examined the effect of synthetic retinoids and found a strong enhancement of
nonamyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor
protein by the  xxxd3105xxx  analog  xxxd71xxx : it stimulated
adam10 promoter activity with an ec50 of 1.5 ␮m and
led to an increase of mature adam10 protein that resulted in a two- to three-fold increase of the ratio between
␣- and ␤-secretase activity in neuroblastoma cells. the
␣-secretase stimulation by  xxxd71xxx  was completely inhibited by the adam10-specific inhibitor gi254023x. intracerebral injection of  xxxd71xxx  in app/ps1–21 transgenic
mice led to a reduction of a␤40 and a␤42. the results of
this study may have clinical relevance because  xxxd71xxx  has
been approved for the treatment of psoriasis since 1997
and found generally safe for long-term use in humans.—

abstract

key words: alzheimer’s disease 䡠  xxxg178xxx 
䡠 shedding 䡠 nuclear receptors 䡠  xxxd3105xxx 
the  xxxg178xxx  (app) is a type-1
membrane glycoprotein, found at the cell surface and
intracellular membrane systems of many cell types,
including neurons. cleavage of app in the brain by ␤and then ␥-secretase generates amyloid-␤ peptides
(a␤39 – 43), which in their oligomeric form are synaptotoxic and thus are the apparent pathogenic agent in
alzheimer’s disease (ad; reviewed in ref. 1). under
nonpathological conditions, a much larger fraction of
app is processed by the ␣-secretase, which cleaves
within the a␤ sequence (2). this cleavage releases a

soluble, amino-terminal app fragment (referred to as
apps␣) and leaves a membrane-bound carboxy-terminal fragment of 83 amino acids ( xxxg178xxx ). subsequently,
the ␥-secretase can cleave  xxxg178xxx  to yield a small secreted
peptide, p3, and a free intracellular domain of app.
the secreted extracellular domain of app, which is
produced by the ␣-secretase (apps␣), has neurotrophic
and neuroprotective properties (3, 4) and enhances
long-term potentiation in vitro (5). in behavioral paradigms, recombinant apps␣ was demonstrated to improve memory in normal and amnestic mice (6). the
view that apps␣ contributes to normal memory function is supported by recent findings that endogenous
apps␣ enhances the hippocampal nmda receptor
function, ltp, and hippocampus-dependent spatial
memory in adult rats (7). accordingly, apps␣ can
rescue anatomical, behavioral, and electrophysiological
abnormalities in app-deficient mice (8).
several studies have shown reduced levels of apps␣ in
the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) of patients with either
familial (9) or sporadic (10 –12) forms of ad. the stimulation of the ␣-secretase thus may have beneficial effects
on ad pathology by preventing the generation of a␤ and
increasing secreted amounts of apps␣.
the disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (adam10)
was identified as a major ␣-secretase that processes app in
vitro (13) and in vivo (14): it has been shown that in an ad
mouse model, overexpression of adam10 increased the
generation of apps␣ and inhibited the production of
apps␤ and a␤ and the formation of plaque. as a consequence, moderate adam10 overexpression improved
cognitive deficits in the ad mouse model (14). furthermore, by generating apps␣, adam10 increases cortical
synaptogenesis in mice and thus might influence cortical
synaptic plasticity (15).
since enhancing the adam10 gene expression might
be a promising approach for the treatment of ad, the
human adam10 gene was functionally analyzed (16).

are located in the adam10 promoter region ⫺302 and
⫺203 bp upstream of the translation start site of the
adam10 gene. accordingly, human adam10 promoter
reporter assays showed a significant increase in transcriptional activity by treatment of neuroblastoma cells with the
major  xxxd3105xxx  metabolite  xxxd3417xxx  (atra).
moreover, mrna and protein levels of adam10 were
increased by atra, which was accompanied by increased
apps␣ secretion in cells (17, 18).
genetic, metabolic, and dietary evidence has been
provided for a defective retinoid metabolism in ad:
serum levels of the  xxxd3417xxx  precursors,  xxxd3105xxx 
and carotenoids, are decreased in ad patients (19, 20).
the activity of the  xxxd3417xxx -generating enzyme
retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (raldh) is increased in
the hippocampus and parietal cortex in ad brains (21).
several genes of proteins that are linked to ad pathology, such as  xxxg440xxx  (chat), insulin
degrading enzyme (ide), or  xxxg177xxx  (apoe),
are retinoid regulated (22–24). moreover, genetic linkages can be found to ad for markers close to chromosomal loci coding for genes of retinoid receptors,
retinol dehydrogenases, and cellular  xxxd3417xxx -binding proteins (25). recently, retinoid hyposignaling was
shown to result in aging-related decline of the hippocampal function in mice (26).
response to  xxxd3417xxx  is mediated by the retinoid
x receptors (rxrs), which can bind to the dna of
target genes as rxr/rxr homodimers but also as
heterodimers. appropriate binding partners for rxrs
are a second class of retinoid receptors—the retinoid
acid receptors (rars)— or a wide variety of other
nuclear receptors, such as  xxxg2412xxx  (vdr),
thyroid  xxxg1603xxx  (tr), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ␥ (ppar␥), and liver x receptor
(lxr) (27). some of them might play a role in ad
pathogenesis; the ligand-based ppar␥ activation, for
example, has been shown to decrease a␤ production by
repression of the  xxxg241xxx  promoter (28). agonists of
lxr have been shown to enhance the expression of the
cholesterol efflux transporter ( xxxg9xxx ), which led to a
decreased a␤-production in vivo (29, 30). also, triiodothyronine, the biological active ligand for tr, negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of the app
gene (31). the ␻-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaeonic acid (dha) was suggested to be a physiological rxr ligand (32). epidemiologic studies provided
evidence that increased intake of ␻-3  xxxd2154xxx  may be
beneficial in reducing the risk for ad (33).
a variety of hormones, drugs, and nutritional compounds act as ligands for nuclear receptors. our study
aimed to identify the nuclear receptors that mediate
the retinoid-stimulated adam10 promoter activity.
this finally should help to detect ligands that might be
applicable for a therapeutic approach to stimulate the
nonamyloidogenic ␣-secretase pathway.

from lgc promochem (wesel, germany); atra and troglitazone from alexis axxora (grünberg, germany);  xxxd2071xxx  from
lkt laboratories (st. paul, mn, usa); gi254023x from glaxo

 xxxd1079xxx  from biomol (hamburg, germany).
antibodies
the anti-apps␣ antibody (clone 6e10), recognizing the
amino acid residues 1–17 within the a␤-peptide sequence,
was purchased from senetek (st. louis, mo, usa); the
anti-apps␤ antibody was purchased from covance (princeton, nj, usa); and the app c-terminal antibody (6687) was
provided by christian haass (ludwig-maximilians university,
munich). because of different specificities, we used antiadam10 (c-terminal) antibodies from different sources for
the detection of the proteinase in n2a and sh-sy5y-cells.
the adam10 antibody used for the detection in n2a cell
lines was obtained from chemicon (temecula, ca, usa) and
for the detection in sh-sy5y cell lines from calbiochem (san
diego, ca, usa). the anti-actin antibody was purchased from
sigma. horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies
as well as the supersignal west pico chemiluminescent substrate were purchased from pierce (rockford, il, usa).
cell lines
the n2a cell line overexpressing the app695 swedish mutant
(n2a app695swe) was kindly provided by dr. g. thinakaran
(department of neurobiology, pharmacology and physiology,
university of chicago, chicago, il, usa), and the sh-sy5y
app695swe cell line by dr. i. hussain (glaxo smith kline).
cloning of promoter constructs and rar
expression vectors
cloning of the human adam10 promoter-luciferase vector
was described previously (16). the mouse homologue gene
region was amplified with a pfu/taq mix (promega, mannheim, germany) using the bacmid bacrp23–364m15 (invitrogen, karlsruhe, germany) with the primers mad10_for:
5⬘-aattattatctgctaagcacttgt-3⬘; mad10_rev: 5⬘-tctaagcttccccggccgc-3⬘. the amplificate was digested within the hindiii site in
the reverse primer and cloned into the smai/hindiii digested
luciferase containing vector pgl-3 basic (promega). restriction and sequencing analysis confirmed the identity of the
promoter sequence.
to obtain a positive control for investigations of different
retinoids, we designed a reporter vector, including two typical
 xxxg1057xxx  binding sites for rar/rxr heterodimers (34). two
oligonucleotides were annealed to create double-stranded dna
with the directed repeat aggtca(5n)aggtca:
rare_for: 5⬘-ctagcaggaggtcaccaggaggtcaccaggaggtcaccaggaggtcacca-3⬘; and rare_rev:
5⬘-gtcctccagtggtcctccagtggtcctccagtggtcctccagtggtctag-3⬘.
single-stranded overhangs of the annealed oligonucleotides were used to substitute the nf␬b sensing dna sequence
within the nhei/bglii digested nf␬b-luciferase reporter vector from bd biosciences (heidelberg, germany). the plasmid was designated as rare-luciferase construct.
the cdnas of the three  xxxd3417xxx  receptors (␣, ␤, and ␥)
were amplified by reverse transcription based on total rna of
human neuroblastoma cell line sh-sy5y. primers were as follows: rar␣_for: 5⬘-ggaagcttatggccagcaacagcag-3⬘;
rar␣_rev: 5⬘-tggatcctcccggggagtgggtg-3⬘; rar␤_

5⬘-tggatcctaattgcacgagtggtgac-3⬘; rar␥_for: 5⬘ggaagctttgccatggccaccaataag-3⬘; rar␥_rev: 5⬘tggatcctccggctggggacttc-3⬘. reverse transcription and pcr were performed by either one-step (abgene,
hamburg, germany) or two-step reaction (qiagen, hilden,
germany) following manufacturer’s instructions. cdna flanking bamhi and hindiii restriction sites in the primers were
used for cloning the amplificates into the expression vector
pcdna6-v5/his6 (invitrogen). sequencing analysis was performed to check integrity of the amplified inserts.
cell culture and treatments
all cell lines were maintained at 37°c in 5% co2 atmosphere.
sh-sy5y cells were cultivated in dmem/f12, while n2a,
thp1, hek293, and hepg2 cells were kept in dmem. media
were supplemented with 10% fcs and 1% glutamine. for
experimental conditions, phenol red-free media were used,
and receptor agonists were added with a maximum solvent
concentration of 0.1% (dmso or ethanol). incubation periods were as indicated. for incubations longer than 24 h,
compounds were added again in fresh medium every 24 h.
promoter assay
transfections of cells grown on 24-well plates were performed
with lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (invitrogen). briefly, 2 ng/␮l of each vector
construct and 0.5 ng/␮l of normalizing vector for phrl were
added to the transfection medium. after 5 h incubation,
transfection mixtures were exchanged with culture medium
supplemented with ligands, as described above, for the indicated incubation time.
subsequently, cells were washed with pbs and lysed in 100
␮l lysis buffer (promega) per well. lysis was promoted by
freezing overnight at ⫺20°c before luciferase activity was
determined using assay systems from promega with the fluostaroptima (bmg, offenburg, germany). for control experiments using the rare-luciferase construct, dual assays
were performed, normalizing firefly luciferase to cotransfected renilla luciferase. experiments concerning either human or mouse adam10 promoter were normalized to protein content by the method of bradford.
rna preparation
rna was prepared from cells grown on 6-well plates using the
isolation kit nucleospin rna/protein (macherey & nagel,
düren, germany). chromosomal dna was eliminated by
dnase digestion during preparation. samples were stored at
⫺80°c and freshly diluted for real-time rt-pcr application.
real-time rt-pcr
rna (100 ng/sample) was subjected to quantitative analysis by
real-time rt-pcr using the quantitectsybrgreen kit (qiagen) and the abiprism 7000 (applied biosystems, bedford, ma,
usa). primers were obtained from qiagen: quantitectassays
qt00309099 ( xxxg861xxx ), qt00095865 (rar␣), qt00062741
(rar␤), qt00000987 (rar␥), or adam10_reti_for and _rev
(5⬘-ctggccaacctatttgtggaa-3⬘; 5⬘-gaccttgacttgg
actgcactg-3⬘). the mrna quantities were calculated from
calibration curves for each primer pair concerning rna in the
range of 1 ␮g to 1 ng.
retinoid-based adam10 stimulation

analysis of secreted app-processing products and of
adam10 expression
the cells were grown on 6-well plates near to confluency.
receptor agonists were added in fresh culture medium, and
cells were incubated for 43 h. after being washed 2 times
with serum-free culture medium, cells were further incubated for 5 h with the indicated compounds in serum-free
culture medium containing fatty acid-free bsa (10 ␮g/ml).
for the quantification of apps␣ and apps␤ by western blot
analysis, the proteins of the supernatants were precipitated
with 10% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid. samples were centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 g and were washed twice with 500 ␮l of
ice-cold acetone, dissolved in laemmli buffer containing
100 mm dithiothreitol, and heated to 95°c for 10 min.
the cells were washed with pbs, and membrane proteins
were prepared as follows. cells were frozen in lysis buffer (10
mm hepes/naoh, ph7.4) and thereafter disrupted with an
ultrasonic branson sonifier (heinemann, schwäbischgmünd, germany). after a centrifugal step for 30 min at
4°c and 10,000 g, the membrane pellets were dissolved in
buffer (10 mm hepes/naoh, ph7.4) to a final protein
content of 0.8 ␮g/␮l. proteins of supernatant (1/2 of well)
and membrane fraction (10 ␮g) were separated by 8%
sds-gels and blotted onto polyvinylidine difluoride
(pvdf) membranes. immunodetection of the secreted
app fragments in the supernatant fraction was performed
by incubating the membrane overnight at 4°c with the
anti-apps␣ antibody (6e10) at a dilution of 1:1000 or with
the anti-apps␤ antibody at a dilution of 1:250. the immunodetection of membrane bound proteins was performed
by incubating with the 6687 antibody for app (1:500) or
with the anti-adam10 antibodies (1:1000) and anti-actin
antibody (1:1000). after incubation with the horseradish
peroxidase coupled secondary antibodies (pierce), blots
were incubated with supersignal west pico chemiluminescent substrate (pierce) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. the chemiluminescent signals were detected by
ccd-camera imaging (bio-rad, munich, germany) followed by quantification with the software aida 3.5 (raytest, straubenhardt, germany). the values of the band
intensity were normalized to the protein amount measured
in aliquots of the membrane fraction by the bradford
method.
 xxxd71xxx  treatment of transgenic mice
male transgenic mice (5– 6 mo old), coexpressing km670/
671nl mutated  xxxg178xxx  and l166p
mutated  xxxg1857xxx  under the control of a neuronspecific thy1 promoter 25 element on a c57bl/6j genetic
background, were used for in vivo experiments (35). after
anesthesia with a mixture of ketamine and xylazin, the
mice were placed in a stereotactic frame. at 60 s after
insertion of the glass capillary, 1 ␮l solution was injected at
a constant flow rate of 250 nl/min (dmso, 5 mice; or 100
mm  xxxd71xxx  in dmso, 4 mice). solutions were injected in
the right hippocampus (stereotactic coordinates: anteroposterior 2.0 mm, mediolateral 1.0 mm, and dorsoventral
2.0 mm) using a glass microcapillary and a motorized
injection pump (world precision instruments, sarasota,
fl, usa). the injection needle was kept in place for an
additional 5 min to prevent reflux of the injected solution.
mice were sacrificed 48 h after the injection. all animal
experiments were performed in accordance with the german guidelines for the care and the use of laboratory
animals and the european communities council directive
of 24 november 1986 (86/609/eec).

results

the right hemispheres of stereotaxically injected mice were
prepared and homogenized in pbs containing a protease
inhibitor cocktail (roche) in a bead grinder homogenizer
(bertin technologies, saint-quentin-en-yvelines, france).
soluble a␤ was separated from the insoluble fraction by
100,000 g ultracentrifugation for 50 min at 4°c using a
tla120.1 rotor (beckman-coulter, fullerton, ca, usa). for
the detection of transgenic a␤ peptides, elisa kits were used
as recommended by the manufacturer [human a␤1– 42 (n);
human a␤1– 40 (fl); ibl, hamburg, germany]. in brief, 20
␮l of soluble fraction of cortex was used for detection of a␤42
and 5 ␮l for detection of a␤40. all samples were measured in
duplicates, and the picogram values of a␤ peptides were
normalized to protein content of the samples.

regulation of human and mouse adam10

statistical analysis
data are expressed as means ⫾ sd. comparison between
controls and treated groups were performed using one-way
anova or unpaired student’s t test. values of p ⬍ 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.

to investigate the physiological context in which
adam10 might be regulated by  xxxd3105xxx  metabolites,
we treated several human cell lines derived from different tissues with atra (fig. 1a). similar to the neuroblastoma cell line sh-sy5y, thp1 cells—which are
precursors of monocytic blood cells— displayed significantly enhanced adam10 expression on atra treatment. however, cells of liver (hepg2) or kidney
(hek293) origin showed no significant response of
adam10 expression to the retinoid receptor ligand.
these results suggest that retinoid-effected adam10
up-regulation does not occur in all tissue types expressing adam10 and might not represent a systemic event.
the comparison of human and murine adam10
promoters revealed a sequence identity of 78% within
500 bp upstream of either translation start site (16).

acid receptors in the 5⬘ region of the adam10 gene
(⫺203 and ⫺302 bp upstream of the translation start
site on both promoters) was predicted by analysis using
the matinspector software (http://www.genomatix.de/
products/matinspector/). these binding sites differ
between human and mouse in one nucleotide (16). to
examine whether adam10 promoter activation by retinoids in neuronal cells is species specific due to the
deviating dna sequence, we transfected mouse (n2a)
and human (sh-sy5y) neuroblastoma cells with either
murine or human adam10 promoter-luciferase vector
constructs. as shown in fig. 1b, the incubation with
2 ␮m atra for 48 h led to nearly identical stimulation
of both the mouse and the human adam10 promoter
in each neuroblastoma cell line. both the mrna level
and the promoter activity of adam10 were found to be
increased by treatment with the retinoid. the more
pronounced effect on mrna might be due to yet
unidentified enhancer elements within the physiological gene locus but outside the core promoter region
(⫺2179 to ⫺1 bp) of our construct. to confirm the
atra mediated elevation of adam10 on the protein
level after 48 h, membrane proteins of sh-sy5y
app695swe cells treated with 2 ␮m atra were analyzed
(fig. 1c): the amount of the immature form of
adam10 was increased (20%) as well as the mature
form (29%, p⬍0.05). the increased expression of the
␣-secretase induced an intensified nonamyloidogenic
app processing as shown by secreted app fragments
apps␣, apps␤, and the c-terminal cleavage product
ctf␣ (for quantification of the apps␣/apps␤ ratio see
fig. 3).
involvement of rars in adam10 transcription
different isomers of  xxxd2071xxx  preferentially bind
to distinct classes of nuclear receptors: the all-transform atra preferentially activates rars with only little
effect on rxrs, while 9- xxxd2404xxx  is the main
retinoid derivative to stimulate rxrs but also activates
to a lower extent rars (36, 37). in contrast, 13-cis-retinoic
acid is not able to activate either receptor type (38).
to determine the receptors involved in the stimulation of the adam10 promoter, we investigated the
influence of all three naturally occurring  xxxd3417xxx 
isomers on the adam10 expression level in the neuroblastoma cell line sh-sy5y (fig. 2a). whereas 13-cisretinoic acid incubation had no effect on adam10
expression after either 48 or 96 h of incubation, atra
induced expression after 48 h, which persisted up to
96 h. for 9- xxxd2404xxx  up-regulation of adam10,
mrna was significantly observed only after the longer
incubation period. because atra is the most potent
activator of adam10 expression of the three isomers,
we conclude that rars are involved in adam10 promoter regulation by  xxxd3417xxx .
in addition to the naturally occurring  xxxd3417xxx 
isomers, we used the rar selective synthetic agonist
 xxxd1058xxx  (39) and  xxxd1079xxx  as a selective ligand
for rxr (40).  xxxd1058xxx  stimulated the human and
mouse adam10 promoter constructs in sh-sy5y cells
after 48 h incubation, whereas  xxxd1079xxx  had no
retinoid-based adam10 stimulation

siginficant effects (fig. 2b). the stimulatory effect of
 xxxd1058xxx  was also evident for the adam10 mrna level,
which was nearly doubled in comparison to solventtreated cells (p⬍0.05; data not shown). incubation with
the polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaeonic acid
(dha), which has been suggested as a physiological
rxr ligand (32), also had no effect on the adam10
promoter (data not shown).
western blot analysis of supernatants from ttnpbtreated sh-sy5y cells revealed a significantly increased
ratio between the soluble apps␣ and apps␤, as compared to the solvent-treated cells (fig. 2c). we also
observed a slight but significant increase of the immature as well as the mature adam10 protein after
incubation with  xxxd1058xxx  (fig. 2c). treatment of neuroblastoma cells with the rar selective ligand  xxxd1058xxx ,
therefore, further demonstrates a role of rars for
enhanced adam10 expression, and for ␣-secretase
activation.
effect of rar isotypes on adam10 promoter activity
the nuclear  xxxg1603xxx  rar consists of three
isotypes (␣, ␤, ␥), which are encoded by different genes
(34). their promoters are known to have rare motifs
(41, 42). we, therefore, examined the transcription of
rar ␣, ␤, and ␥ mrna in sh-sy5y cells, following atra
addition (fig. 2d). while rar␣ mrna remained unchanged after 48 h atra incubation, the isotype ␤ was
highly up-regulated, and the isotype ␥ was slightly
up-regulated after 48 h (and 96 h; data not shown).
our results are in accordance with former experiments,
which also showed high up-regulation of the ␤ isotype
after 48 h and only a transient increase of rar␣ after
24 h (43).
next, we tested the direct involvement of single rars
in the promoter activity of the human adam10 gene.
by cotransfection experiments with either human ␣, ␤,
or ␥ rar isotypes and the adam10 promoter-luciferase vector in n2a cells, we found that rar␣ and ␤
increased basal and atra-stimulated adam10 promoter activity (fig. 2e). the promoter activity by cotransfected rar␤ was not further elevated by atra.
this might be due to the serum content of the retinoid,
which, in combination with the overexpressed nuclear
receptor, might already be sufficient for the fully activated promoter. rar␥ failed to induce the transcription of the human adam10 promoter (p⬎0.05 for
control and atra treatment), which was not due to
missing functionality of the overexpressed receptor as
controlled by experiments with the rare-containing
reporter vector (data not shown). these results suggest
that rar␣ and ␤ can enhance the adam10 promoter
activity, although rar␣ expression itself is induced

figure 3. rxr heterodimer binding partners and their ligands, which
might play a role in the transcriptional activation of adam10.
a) adam10 promoter contains two putative  xxxd3417xxx  binding sites,
at positions ⫺203 and ⫺302 bp upstream of the translation start site, as
shown in ref. 16. while ligands of the retinoid receptors rar and rxr
(dark gray) stimulate adam10 promoter and secretase activity (see fig.
2), ligands of the potential rxr dimerization partner vdr, tr, ppar␥,
and lxr (gray) may also be involved in the regulation of adam10.
because other rxr dimer partners such as  xxxg1598xxx , fxr, and car (light

excluded from further investigations. b) activation of human and

erodimers where the rxr ligand alone can activate the
transcription (e.g., ppar␥) and nonpermissive heterodimers that require the ligand of the rxr binding
partner (44). our results described above indicate that
enhanced adam10 transcription is due to a nonpermissive rar/rxr heterodimer.
because two distinct potential binding sites of retinoid receptors were identified in the adam 10 promoter
region, we cannot exclude that in addition to a rar/
rxr dimer other nuclear receptors might be involved.
to determine a further role of rxr heterodimeric
partners, we incubated sh-sy5y cells expressing the
human or mouse adam10 promoter construct for 48 h
with either the selective vdr agonist 1␣,25-dihydroxy
 xxxd1682xxx , the tr agonist triiodothyronine, the
ppar␥ agonist troglitazone, or the lxr agonist 22-rhydroxycholesterol. we observed a significant enhancement of the human and mouse promoter activity by
stimulation with the vdr agonist 1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx  and the tr agonist triiodothyronine (fig. 3b).
these observations thus indicate a potential role of
vdr/rxr and tr/rxr heterodimers in adam10
stimulation, which belongs like rar/rxr to the subclass of nonpermissive heterodimers. however, the
ligands of ppar␥ and lxr (troglitazone, 22-r-hydroxyretinoid-based adam10 stimulation

cholesterol), which activate receptors of the permissive
heterodimer subclass, revealed no effect on the human
or mouse adam10 promoter. this result suggests that
rxr/ppar␥ or rxr/lxr heterodimers have no effect on the transcriptional activation of adam10.
considering the adam10 promoter activation by
agonists of several nonpermissive rxr heterodimer
ligands (fig. 3b), we were interested in whether this
stimulation results in an increased ␣-secretase cleavage
of app, as has been described above for  xxxd1058xxx  (fig.
2c) and for atra (17, 45). therefore, we treated
sh-sy5y cells overexpressing the app695 swedish mutant, sh-sy5y app695swe, with either atra, 1␣,25dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx , or triiodothyronine (fig. 3c).
the atra-incubated cells showed a significant increase in apps␣ secretion as has been observed in
former experiments. in addition, we noted a significant
decrease of apps␤, whereas the amount of unprocessed
full-length app remained unchanged. despite the stimulation of adam10 promoter activity by 1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx , the amount of secreted apps␣ and
apps␤ was not significantly different as compared to
solvent-treated cells (fig. 3c). furthermore, we observed no differences in the adam10 protein levels
after ligand treatment (data not shown). surprisingly,
1649

after incubation with the tr agonist triiodothyronine
we detected a decrease of apps␣ and increase of apps␤
(fig. 3c), although we neither found an alteration in
the amount of adam10 (not shown) or of full-length
app after ligand treatment. obviously, the activation of
adam10 promotor by these two ligands is quickly
down-regulated.
 xxxd71xxx  enhances the adam10-mediated
apps␣ secretion
our results indicate a rar/rxr heterodimer-mediated activation of the adam10 promoter, resulting in
enhanced adam10 expression and apps␣ secretion,
and in diminished secretion of apps␤. therefore, a
retinoid-based treatment might represent a therapeutic
approach for the prevention of ad. orally administered synthetic retinoids have found clinical applications in dermatology (46) and oncology (47).  xxxd71xxx ,
an aromatic analog of  xxxd3105xxx  (see fig. 7), has
replaced its ethyl ester  xxxd2071xxx  for long-term treatment of psoriasis, because of its more favorable pharmacokinetic profile (48 –50). we examined the activation of the adam10 promoter by  xxxd2071xxx  or  xxxd71xxx 
in neuronal cells of human and mouse origin. as shown
in fig. 4a, incubation with  xxxd2071xxx  had no effects on
adam10 promoter activity, whereas  xxxd71xxx  enhanced
the promoter activity up to 50%, which is comparable
to atra-mediated stimulation (fig. 1b). for adam10
promoter activation, ec50 values of 1.5 ␮m and 1.2 ␮m
were determined for  xxxd71xxx  and atra, respectively.

since  xxxd71xxx  stimulates the retinoid receptor indirectly (51), (52) whereas the activation mechanism of
 xxxd2071xxx  is unknown, we studied the effects of these
agents on a rare-luciferase construct. the results
showed a strong increase of the rare activation by
 xxxd71xxx  but not by  xxxd2071xxx  (fig. 4b). this indicates
that  xxxd2071xxx  as a metabolic precursor for  xxxd71xxx  is
not taken up or hydrolyzed to  xxxd71xxx  by sh-sy5y
cells.
to examine an effect of  xxxd71xxx  on ␣-secretase
activity, we determined the secretion of apps␣ and
apps␤ in different neuronal cell lines of human and
mouse origin after incubation with  xxxd71xxx . we observed a strongly enhanced apps␣/apps␤ ratio in
human sh-sy5y cells as well as in the sh-sy5y and
mouse n2a cell lines overexpressing the app695 swedish mutant (fig. 4c).  xxxd71xxx  treatment increased the
amount of adam10 in three examined cell lines. this
effect was significant for the mature proteinase in
sh-sy5y cells and for both the proform and the mature
form in sh-sy5y app695swe- cells (fig. 4d).
because other disintegrin metalloproteinases like
 xxxg63xxx  ( xxxg63xxx ) are considered as ␣-sectretases (53), we
used the metalloproteinase inhibitor gi254023x with
selectivity for adam10 (54). the treatment of sh-sy5y
cells with gi254023x resulted in a drastically decreased
amount of apps␣ (and increased amount of apps␤), due
to the inhibition of basal ␣-secretase activity (fig. 5).
 xxxd71xxx  strongly enhanced the production of apps␣
(and decreased the amount of apps␤). coincubation of
cells with  xxxd71xxx  and gi254023x almost completely

finding that  xxxd3417xxx  enhances the transcription
and translation of adam10, probably due to the presence of two rar binding sites in its promoter (16, 17).
for  xxxg63xxx  ( xxxg63xxx ), we previously showed no influence of atra on its expression (17). human and mouse
adam10 genes are evolutionarily highly conserved
within 500 bp upstream of either translation initiation
site. in this region, the promoters of the two species
contain two potential  xxxd3417xxx  response sequences,
which differ in only one nucleotide. our results now
show that human and murine adam10 promoters are
stimulated by atra to the same extent in both mouse
and human neuroblastoma cells, indicating that in
these two species adam10 promoter stimulation by
retinoids occurs by the same mechanism. furthermore,

inhibited the formation of apps␣ to an extent comparable with the incubation with the inhibitor alone. the
stimulatory effect of  xxxd71xxx  on the ␣-secretory processing of app is therefore a consequence of adam10
up-regulation.
influence of  xxxd71xxx  on app processing in a mouse
model of ad
to demonstrate the  xxxd71xxx -induced nonamyloidogenic app processing in vivo, app/ps1–21 double
transgenic mice (described in ref. 35) were stereotaxically injected intracerebrally with  xxxd71xxx . we observed an enhanced apps␣/apps␤ ratio of ⬃40% in
cortical tissue samples as compared to solvent-treated
mice (fig. 6a). in addition, a decrease in a␤ peptides
was measured: a␤42 was reduced ⬃50% and a␤40 ⬃25%
in mice injected with the synthetic retinoid (fig. 6b).

discussion
in this report, we examined in detail nonsteroidal
nuclear receptors acting on the adam10 promoter,
thus enhancing ␣-secretase activity. on the basis of
these findings, we investigated the ability of the synthetic retinoid  xxxd71xxx , the drug of choice for treating
psoriasis, for its ability to activate the nonamyloidogenic pathway via its action on adam10.
the starting point for our experiments was the
retinoid-based adam10 stimulation

our experiments with different cell lines demonstrate
that the retinoid-stimulated adam10 transcription
takes place in neural and monocytic blood cells but not
in liver- and kidney-derived cells. since a variety of
defects of retinoid transport and metabolisms in the
brain have been reported in ad (for a review see ref.
55), an up-regulation of adam10 ␣-secretase activity by
retinoids selectively in the brain might be of therapeutic interest.
the present studies with  xxxd3417xxx  isomers and
with synthetic agonists of either rar or rxr clearly
demonstrate the involvement of rars in adam10
promoter stimulation. for the rar-specific compound
 xxxd1058xxx , we found adam10 promoter activation and an
increase in adam10 expression as well as in ␣-secretase
activity, as has been described for atra (16, 17). in
another attempt to identify receptor isotypes, we coexpressed cloned human rar␣, ␤, or ␥ with a human
adam10 promoter-luciferase construct in neuroblastoma cells. overexpressed rar␣ and rar␤ increased
the basal activity, and atra-stimulated adam10 promoter activity. rar␤ itself was up-regulated by atra in
human neuroblastoma cells, which is in accordance
with the findings of carpentier et al. (43). comparison
of the up-regulation of adam10 and rar␤ by atra
showed a similar time course of enhanced transcription
for adam10 and rar␤ and therefore indicates a
reinforcement of the retinoid signaling pathway. by
electromobility shift analysis (emsa), the rare at
⫺203 bp upstream of the translation initiation site of
adam10 promoter has been found to be protein
bound (16). for a distinct identification of retinoic
receptor isoform binding on the two potential rares
in the core region of adam10 promoter, additional
emsa studies will be necessary.
by immunocytochemical analysis, ␣, ␤, and ␥ rars
have been detected in the mouse adult central nervous
system (56). the expression patterns of rars and
rxrs overlap in all mouse cns structures, which is not
surprising as rar/rxr heterodimers are most probably the functional units transducing the retinoid signal
in vertebrates. with respect to our results, the high
expression of rar␣ in the hippocampus ca fields and
in the frontal and parietal cortex is of note. recent data
suggest that higher cognitive functions, such as the
creation of hippocampal memory, require atra and its
receptors rar for effecting synaptic plasticity (57–59).
accordingly, atra has been found to stimulate spine
formation in hippocampal neurons through rar␣
(60). also for rar␤, an essential role in hippocampal
ca1 long-term potentiation has been described (57).
rxrs are also implicated in  xxxd3417xxx -independent signaling pathways, since they can additionally
form functional heterodimers with nuclear receptors
other than rar, which are also expressed in the cns
(27). by using specific agonists for several of these
receptors, we found that ligands of the  xxxd1682xxx 
receptor (vdr) and the thyroid  xxxg1603xxx 
(tr) activate the human and mouse promoter to a
similar extent as atra. in this respect, note that single
nucleotide polymorphisms coding for the dna binding
site of the  xxxg2412xxx  have been found to be
associated to ad (61). however, the stimulation of
1652

adam10 promoter activity by 1␣,25-dihydroxy vitamin
d3 did not result in higher adam10 protein expression or ␣-secretase activation. in the case of the tr
agonist triodothyronine, we even found a decrease of
apps␣ and an increase of apps␤ without alteration in
the amount of adam10 or full-length app. this effect
of triodothyronine might reflect alterations of processing and secretion of app fragments (62). 1␣,25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx  and triodothyronine, therefore, apparently stimulate cellular mechanisms that counteract
the stimulation of the adam10 promoter.
 xxxd71xxx , a synthetic retinoid effective for the treatment of psoriasis, has been shown to release atra from
cellular  xxxd3417xxx -binding proteins (crabps) (51,
52). as  xxxd71xxx  has a much lower affinity for the rars
than atra, it increases the occupancy of the rar
transcription complex with atra indirectly by its displacement from crabps (fig. 7).
in the present study, we discovered that  xxxd71xxx  treatment of neuroblastoma cells activates the human
adam10 promoter, thereby leading to enhanced expression of mature adam10 and a shift from the amyloidogenic pathway to the nonamyloidogenic pathway. because
both forms of adam10 (mature and immature) were
induced in parallel, according to our results atra stimulation of adam10 is based on gene regulatory mechanisms. nevertheless, we cannot exclude nongenomic effects of atra or its synthetic derivative on ␣-secretase

figure 7. schematic representation illustrating  xxxd71xxx -based
adam10 promoter activation.  xxxd71xxx , the aromatic analog
of  xxxd3105xxx , increases the intracellular availability of atra by
preferentially binding to the cellular  xxxd3417xxx  binding
proteins (crabps). the increased concentration of atra in
turn leads to an activation of the rar/rxr-heterodimers
bound to retinoid binding sites on the adam10 promoter. as
a result of adam10 up-regulation, the nonamyloidogenic
processing of app is enhanced.

activity. the stimulatory effect of  xxxd71xxx  on the ␣-secretase was completely blocked by an inhibitor of adam10,
thus further supporting the role of adam10 for the
␣-secretase activation by  xxxd71xxx .  xxxd2071xxx , the ethyl
ester of  xxxd71xxx , is metabolized to  xxxd71xxx  in intestine
and intestinal epithelial cells (63). probably due to a lack
of conversion to  xxxd71xxx  in neuroblastoma cells,  xxxd2071xxx  had no effect on the adam10 promoter.
 xxxd71xxx  has been approved for the treatment of
psoriasis since 1997, and is generally safe for long-term
use (64). our results further demonstrate that  xxxd71xxx 
stimulates ␣-secretory app processing in the rodent
brain, which leads to an overall increase of apps␣ and
a reduction of the a␤42 and a␤40 peptides. due to these
␣-secretase-enhancing properties, it will be interesting
to examine whether  xxxd71xxx  or its analogues might
also be useful for enhancing the memory function in a
dementia like ad.
