tetrahydrofolate coenzymes involved in one-carbon (c1) metabolism are polyglutamylated. in organisms that synthesize tetrahydrofolate de novo, dihydrofolate synthetase (dhfs) and folylpolyglutamate synthetase ( xxxg814xxx ) catalyze the attachment of glutamate
residues to the folate molecule. in this study we isolated cdnas
coding a dhfs and three isoforms of  xxxg814xxx  from arabidopsis
thaliana. the function of each enzyme was demonstrated by
complementation of yeast mutants deficient in dhfs or  xxxg814xxx 
activity, and by measuring in vitro glutamate incorporation into
dihydrofolate or tetrahydrofolate. dhfs is present exclusively in
the mitochondria, making this compartment the sole site of synthesis of dihydrofolate in the plant cell. in contrast,  xxxg814xxx  is present
as distinct isoforms in the mitochondria, the cytosol, and the
chloroplast. each isoform is encoded by a separate gene, a situation
that is unique among eukaryotes. the compartmentation of  xxxg814xxx 
isoforms is in agreement with the predominance of ␥-glutamylconjugated tetrahydrofolate derivatives and the presence of serine
hydroxymethyltransferase and c1-tetrahydrofolate interconverting enzymes in the cytosol, the mitochondria, and the plastids.
thus, the combination of  xxxg814xxx  with these folate-mediated reactions can supply each compartment with the polyglutamylated
folate coenzymes required for the reactions of c1 metabolism.
also, the multicompartmentation of  xxxg814xxx  in the plant cell suggests
that the transported forms of folate are unconjugated.

i

n all living cells, tetrahydrofolate ( xxxd2146xxx ) is involved in
one-carbon (c1) transfer reactions. it is an absolute requirement for the synthesis of purine, thymidylate, formylmethionyltrna, pantothenate, and methionine, and for the interconversion of glycine and serine. the tetrahydrofolate molecule
[5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteroylpoly-␥-glutamate (h4f-glun)] capable
of carrying and donating c1 units consists chemically of a
pteridine ring attached to a para aminobenzoic acid (p-aba)
moiety, which in turn is attached to glutamate residues. because
the affinity of folate-dependent enzymes increases markedly
with the number of glutamate residues, the folylpolyglutamates
are the preferred coenzymes of c1 metabolism (reviewed in refs.
1–3). the conjugated forms of the vitamin are also involved in
the retention of folate within the cell and its subcellular compartments (4). plant folates vary in their levels of glutamyl
conjugation, the pentaglutamate species being the most abundant in pea cotyledons and leaves (5). h4f-glun is present in
various compartments of the plant cell. the cytosol contains the
largest pool of folates, predominantly in the form of polyglutamylated methyl derivatives. in pea leaves, mitochondria and
chloroplasts also contain principally (⬎90%) polyglutamylated
forms (5, 6). the distribution of folates among the organelles is
unequal because the estimated concentration of folates in mitochondria is 100–150-fold higher than in chloroplasts (7, 8).

in the complex pathway leading to h4f-glun synthesis, two
reactions mediate the attachment of glutamate. the first reaction, catalyzed by dihydrofolate synthetase (dhfs,  xxxg269xxx   xxxg347xxx   xxxg348xxx   xxxg1041xxx   xxxg1392xxx   xxxg2371xxx .12),
attaches the first glutamate residue to the carboxyl moiety of
para aminobenzoic acid (p-aba) to form dihydrofolate. the
enzyme is only present in organisms having the ability to
synthesize h4f de novo from the 6-hydroxymethyldihydropterin,
p-aba, and glutamate precursors (e.g., plants, most bacteria,
fungi, and protozoa). in all organisms, including those requiring
exogenous folate for growth, the polyglutamate tail of h4f-glun
is formed by the sequential addition of ␥-linked glutamate
residues to h4f-glu1, a reaction catalyzed by folylpolyglutamate
synthetase ( xxxg814xxx ,  xxxg814xxx ). the crucial role of the glutamylation steps in h4f-glun synthesis has been demonstrated by the
characterization of mutants affected in the dhfs or  xxxg814xxx 
activities. thus, disruption of the fol3 gene coding dhfs in
saccharomyces cerevisiae leads to spores requiring a stable h4f
derivative for growth (9). mutations affecting  xxxg814xxx  result in
folylpolyglutamate deficiencies and auxotrophies for the products of c1 metabolism. such mutants from s. cerevisiae and
neurospora crassa display methionine auxotrophy (2, 9, 10),
whereas the chinese hamster ovary auxb1 cell line lacking  xxxg814xxx 
activity is auxotroph for purine, thymidine, and glycine (11).
in bacteria that synthesize h4f-glun de novo (escherichia coli,
corynebacterium), the product of the folc gene possesses both
dhfs and  xxxg814xxx  activities (12). yet, the only example of an
eukaryote gene encoding both dhfs and  xxxg814xxx  activities is
from the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum (13). in
other eukaryotes synthesizing folate de novo (plants, fungi),
distinct proteins catalyze the addition of glutamate residues to
dihydropteroate or h4f. in fungi, it has been suggested that
dhfs is a cytosolic enzyme and that  xxxg814xxx  isoforms are present
in the cytosol and the mitochondria (10, 14). analysis of the
subcellular distribution of folate-synthesizing enzymes in pea
leaves established that mitochondria play a major role in h4fglun synthesis (7). other studies supported the mitochondrial
localization of dhfs (15) and suggested the presence of  xxxg814xxx 
in the cytosol (16). organisms that lack dhfs activity and

materials and methods
plant materials. a. thaliana (ecotype wassilewskija) seeds were
grown on soil with a light intensity of 100 ␮e m⫺2 s⫺1, a day
length of 14 h, and a day兾night temperature of 25兾20°c. a.
thaliana (ecotype columbia) cell suspension cultures were grown
under continuous white light (40 ␮e m⫺2 s⫺1) at 23°c with rotary
agitation at 125 rpm in gamborg’s b5 medium supplemented
with 1 ␮m 2-naphtalene acetic acid and 1.5% (wt兾vol) sucrose.
cdna cloning. poly(a)⫹ mrna was isolated from above-ground

parts of 3-week-old a. thaliana plants and used to construct a
marathon cdna amplification library according to the manufacturer’s instructions (clontech). rapid amplification of
cdna ends (race) pcr was conducted with adapter-specific
primers and sets of antisense (5⬘-race) and sense (3⬘-race)
gene-specific primers designed to generate fragments overlapping by ⬇300 bp. amplification was done with the advantage
cdna polymerase mix according to the manufacturer’s instructions (clontech). pcr products were subcloned into the
pgem t-easy vector (promega) and sequenced by using the
abi prism dye terminator system (genomeexpress, meylan,
france). sequencing confirmed that the isolated sequences
encode dhfs- xxxg814xxx  homologs in arabidopsis. full-length
cdnas were then generated by pcr, cloned in the pgem
vector, and sequenced in both strands. the cloned sequences
were designated atdfa, -b, -c, and -d for a. thaliana dhfsfpgs homologs.
functional complementation in yeast. the s. cerevisiae strains used

in this study were cc788–2b (mat␣, his3, leu2, ura3, and  xxxg1852xxx   xxxg2332xxx ),
cd180 (mata兾␣, his3兾his3, leu2兾leu2, ura3兾ura3, trp1兾trp1, and
met7兾met7:: xxxg1852xxx   xxxg2332xxx ), cd180–5c (mat␣, his3, leu2, ura3,  xxxg1852xxx   xxxg2332xxx ,
and met7:: xxxg1852xxx   xxxg2332xxx ), and cd208–2b (mat␣, his3, leu2, ura3,  xxxg1852xxx   xxxg2332xxx ,
and fol3::his3) (9). growth media and genetic manipulations
were as described by cherest et al. (9). transformation of yeast
strains disrupted for the genes coding  xxxg814xxx  (met7) or dhfs
(fol3) was performed by using the shuttle vector prs316proadh1 that contains the ura3 gene for selection and the
 xxxg72xxx  promoter to drive expression of the arabidopsis cdnas
(18). for expression in yeast, the coding sequences of atdfa,
atdfb, and atdfc devoid of the predicted transit peptide
presequences were amplified by pcr and cloned in prs316proadh1. thus, the atdfa and -b proteins started at met-20
and met-59, respectively. to express the recombinant atdfc
protein, a methionine codon was placed before leu-51. the
entire coding sequence of atdfd was amplified by pcr and
cloned into prs316-proadh1. the sequence of each construct
was verified before transformation.
ravanel et al.

assays of dhfs and  xxxg814xxx  activities. yeast strains were grown in

minimal medium complemented to meet their auxotrophic
requirements, harvested by centrifugation (5,000 ⫻ g, for 5 min)
during exponential growth phase, and washed in 50 mm
tris䡠hcl, ph 8.0兾10 mm  xxxd26xxx  ( xxxd26xxx ). cells were
suspended in 50 mm tris䡠hcl (ph 8.0), 10 mm  xxxd26xxx , 5%
(vol兾vol) glycerol, 1 mm pmsf, and a mixture of protease
inhibitors (no. 1873580, roche molecular biochemicals), and
broken by passage through a french press  xxxd1891xxx ,000 psi (1 psi ⫽
6.89 kpa). cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 ⫻ g for 15 min
at 4°c, and the supernatants were used for enzymatic assays.
proteins were measured by the method of bradford (19) with
bsa as standard.
dhfs and  xxxg814xxx  activities were measured by the incorporation of [3h]glutamate into dihydrofolate and h4f-glun, respectively. the dhfs assay medium (100–200 ␮l) contained 0.1 m
tris䡠hcl (ph 8.0), 50 mm  xxxd26xxx , 20 mm kcl, 5
mm atp, 10 mm mgcl2, 3 mm [3h]glutamate (2 ␮ci, amersham pharmacia), and various amounts of protein extracts. the
reaction was started by the addition of 100 ␮m dihydropteroate
and proceeded for 20–60 min at 37°c. the [3h]dihydrofolate
formed was separated from unreacted [3h]glutamate by ion
exchange chromatography and counted (7). the  xxxg814xxx  activity
was determined by using a similar procedure except that the
reaction was initiated with 100 ␮m h4f-glu1 instead of dihydropteroate. according to schirch (20), 10-cho-h4f was synthesized from 5-cho-h4f, and 5,10-ch2-h4f was generated in
situ by incubating 0.1 mm h4f and 1 mm formaldehyde for 15
min at 37°c before the addition of other reaction components.
the standard assay conditions for  xxxg814xxx  (incubation time and
saturating h4f-glu1 concentration) favored the formation of
folyldiglutamates (5).
preparation of a cytosolic-enriched fraction. protoplasts were prepared by enzymatic digestion of 6-day-old cell suspension cultures, using the procedure described in ref. 21. protoplasts were
gently ruptured by passing through a 20-␮m nylon mesh and
subsequently through a 10-␮m nylon mesh. the protoplast lysate
was centrifuged successively at 100 ⫻ g for 5 min, 900 ⫻ g for 5
min, and 13,000 ⫻ g for 20 min. the 13,000 ⫻ g supernatant
fraction was centrifuged further at 100,000 ⫻ g for 1 h to remove
membranes. pellets were pooled and used, together with the
13,000 ⫻ g supernatant fraction, to measure marker enzyme
activities (7). most of the chloroplast (83 ⫾ 5%, mean of three
independent experiments ⫾ se) and mitochondria (92 ⫾ 2%)
marker activities were recovered in the pooled pellets, whereas
the 13,000 ⫻ g supernatant fraction contained 67 ⫾ 3% of the
cytosolic marker activity. this cytosolic-enriched fraction contained a small proportion of mitochondrial (8 ⫾ 2%) and
chloroplastic (17 ⫾ 5%) marker enzymes.
purification of chloroplasts. chloroplasts were purified from

3-week-old a. thaliana leaves as described in ref. 22. intact
chloroplasts were purified on percoll gradients and lysed in 10
mm mops (ph 7.6), 4 mm mgcl2, 1 mm pmsf, and 1 mm
 xxxd146xxx . chloroplast subfractions were separated on
a step gradient of 0.93–0.6 m sucrose in 10 mm mops (ph 7.6)
by centrifugation at 70,000 ⫻ g for 1 h. the soluble fraction
(stroma) was collected at the top of the 0.6 m sucrose layer.
purification of mitochondria. mitochondria were prepared from
6-day-old arabidopsis cell suspension cultures as described by
douce et al. (23). crude mitochondria were layered on discontinuous gradients consisting of 18, 23, and 40% percoll layers in
0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm potassium phosphate (ph 7.2), 1 mm
edta, and 0.1% bsa. gradients were centrifuged at 39,000 ⫻
g for 40 min, and mitochondria were collected at the 23兾40%
percoll interface. to obtain soluble proteins (matrix), purified

require exogenous folate for growth (animals and bacteria such
as lactobacillus) possess a monofunctional  xxxg814xxx . in mammalian tissues, the enzyme is present in the cytosol and the
mitochondria (4). both forms of  xxxg814xxx  derive from the same
gene by the use of two different translation initiation codons, the
first aug generating the mitochondrial enzyme (17).
during the last decade, our knowledge concerning h4f biosynthesis in plants has improved considerably (for reviews, see
refs. 2 and 3). however, the existence of  xxxg814xxx  isoforms, their
subcellular distribution, and their relative contribution to h4f
biosynthesis have not been yet elucidated. in this study we
describe the cloning and functional characterization of cdnas
coding the enzymes responsible for the glutamylation of dihydropteroate and h4f in arabidopsis thaliana. dhfs is a mitochondrial protein, whereas the three  xxxg814xxx  isoforms characterized are respectively located in the cytosol, the mitochondria,
and the chloroplasts.

mitochondria were lysed by a 10-fold dilution in 10 mm mops
(ph 7.2)兾1 mm dtt and submitted to 3 freeze-thaw cycles.
membranes were removed by centrifugation at 100,000 ⫻ g for 1 h.
ab production and immunoblot analysis. to prepare specific abs,
the atdf proteins were produced in e. coli by using pet15b or
pet20b(⫹) vectors (novagen). for the atdfa and atdfd
proteins, the complete orf was cloned in the expression vectors
whereas atdfb and atdfc were truncated at their n-termini
(58 and 86 residues, respectively) for cloning convenience.
constructs were introduced into bl21(de3)plyss cells (novagen) and protein expression was conducted for 3 h at 37°c in
luria–bertani medium containing 0.4 or 1 mm isopropyl ␤-dthiogalactoside for pet20b(⫹) or pet15b constructs, respectively. most of the expressed proteins were recovered in the
inclusion body fractions. recombinant proteins were purified
further by sds兾page (24) and injected into new zealand
rabbits to raise abs (centre valbex, institut universitaire de
technologie de biologie, villeurbanne, france). proteins from
arabidopsis cell subfractions were resolved by sds兾page and
electroblotted to nitrocellulose membrane. the blots were
probed by using the affinity-purified abs, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit iggs, and detection was
achieved by chemiluminescence.
transient expression of green fluorescent protein (gfp) fusion proteins in arabidopsis protoplasts. a puc18 plasmid expressing the

modified version mgfp4 of the gfp under the control of the
cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter was used for transient
expression experiments in arabidopsis protoplasts (25). the
n-terminal regions of the atdfa, -b, -c, and d proteins fused
upstream and in-frame with mgfp4 contained 82, 100, 119, and
46 residues, respectively. the transit peptide sequences of the
small subunit of rubisco from arabidopsis (55 residues, ats1a
gene, genbank accession no. x13611) and dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase-dihydropteroate synthase (hppk-dhps) from
pea (28 residues; ref. 26) were used as controls for the targeting
of gfp to plastids and mitochondria, respectively. transient
transformation of arabidopsis protoplasts prepared from a
6-day-old cell suspension culture was achieved with the procedure described by abel and theologis (27). just before analysis,
protoplasts were incubated for 5 min at room temperature with
the dye mitotracker orange (cm-h2tmros, molecular
probes). samples were analyzed by confocal laser scanning
microscopy, using a leica tcs-sp2 operating system. gfp,
mitotracker, and chlorophyll fluorescence were excited and
collected sequentially (400 hz line by line) by using 488 nm for
gfp, 543 nm for mitotracker, and 633 nm for chlorophyll
excitation. fluorescence emission was collected from 500 to 535
nm for gfp, from 553 to 600 nm for mitotracker, and from 643
to 720 nm for chlorophyll.

isolation of dhfs- xxxg814xxx  homologs in arabidopsis. in all organisms
studied so far, enzymes displaying dhfs and兾or  xxxg814xxx  activities
share highly conserved motives designated  xxxg814xxx  signatures
(prosite ps01011 and ps01012). by using blast analysis, we
searched the arabidopsis genome database for sequences similar
to these signatures. four dhfs- xxxg814xxx -related sequences were
retrieved. sets of primers were designed to amplify the corresponding cdnas by 5⬘- and 3⬘-rapid amplification of cdna
ends, using poly(a)⫹ mrna isolated from above-ground organs
of 3-week-old arabidopsis plants. the isolated clones displayed
significant homology with known dhfs- xxxg814xxx  sequences and
were designated atdfa, -b, -c, and -d for a. thaliana dhfsfpgs homologs. the main properties of the cdnas are summarized in table 2, which is published as supporting information

fig. 1. phylogenetic analysis of the arabidopsis dhfs- xxxg814xxx  proteins. the
phenogram was produced from a clustal w alignment (28) by using the kitsch
program of the phylip package available at http:兾兾www.infobiogen.fr (bootstrap analysis with 415 trees examined). bifunctional dhfs- xxxg814xxx  from e. coli
(ec, genbank accession no. m32445), p. falciparum (pf, af161264), monofunctional  xxxg814xxx  from s. cerevisiae (sc, nc001147), homo sapiens (hs, m98045), l.
casei (lc, j05221), and monofunctional dhfs from s. cerevisiae (sc, nc001145)
were included in the alignment.

comparison of the entire amino acid sequences deduced from
the isolated cdnas allowed us to classify the atdf proteins into
two classes (fig. 1). atdfb, -c, and -d share 41–47% identity
(58–69% similarity) and form the first subclass. the atdfa
protein seemed to be distinct from this group because identical
residues accounted for only 22% (42% similarities). furthermore, alignment of the arabidopsis proteins (fig. 6, which is
published as supporting information on the pnas web site) led
us to distinguish three domains. the first one located at the n
terminus contained 30–70 residues for atdfa, -b, and -c but
was absent in atdfd. features typical for mitochondrial or
chloroplastic transit peptides were found in the n-terminal
extensions of atdfa, -b, and -c (table 2), thus suggesting that
these proteins are targeted to the organelles. a similar analysis
performed with atdfd revealed no signal sequence, thus
indicating that the protein is most probably cytosolic. the second
region started after the n-terminal domain and extended over
⬇220 residues. it is characterized by the highest similarity score
among the four sequences (28% identical plus 14% similar
residues) and contained a number of residues that are highly
conserved in known  xxxg814xxx  sequences ( xxxg814xxx  signatures; fig. 6).
in particular, the gtkgkgs motif (p loop) and subsequent
blocks are involved in the binding of atp and mg2⫹ (29). except
for the last 40 residues, the c-terminal part of the atdf proteins
was less conserved. however, several blocks of highly conserved
residues are evident, in particular when comparing atdfb, -c,
and -d. structural analysis of  xxxg814xxx  from lactobacillus casei
indicated that the c-terminal domain of the protein is the site of
h4f binding (29). the low percentage of identity observed in this
region between atdfa on one hand and atdfb, -c, and -d on
the other hand may therefore reflect from the utilization of
different substrates, namely dihydropteroate for dhfs vs. h4f
for  xxxg814xxx , by these proteins.
a phylogenetic analysis indicated that atdfb, -c, and -d are
closely related to monofunctional  xxxg814xxx  from eukaryotes (fig.
1). atdfa belonged to another division of the tree that includes
 xxxg814xxx  from l. casei, dhfs- xxxg814xxx  from e. coli, and dhfs from
s. cerevisiae. thus, atdfb, -c, and -d are probably  xxxg814xxx , but
the situation is less obvious for atdfa. it was not possible from
phylogenetic analysis to decipher whether this protein fit in the
class of (i) eukaryotic dhfs or (ii)  xxxg814xxx  and dhfs- xxxg814xxx  from
prokaryotes.

test the function of the arabidopsis dhfs- xxxg814xxx  proteins, the
ravanel et al.

table 1. substrate specificity of  xxxg814xxx  in the different
yeast strains

yeast strains cd180 and cd208–2b disrupted for the met7 and
fol3 genes, respectively, were used (9). yeasts were selected as
host cells for functional complementation because they possess,
as do plants, monofunctional dhfs (fol3 protein) and  xxxg814xxx 
(met7 protein) enzymes. the haploid strain cd208–2b bearing
the fol3⌬ allele grows if the medium is supplemented with
5-cho-h4f, a stable h4f derivative. transformation of
cd208–2b ( fol3⌬) with the shuttle vector containing atdfa
allowed yeast growth on medium lacking 5-cho-h4f (fig. 2a),
providing the first evidence that the atdfa cdna encodes a
functional dhfs protein. expression of atdfb, -c, or -d did
not correct the 5-cho-h4f requirement (fig. 2 a), thus indicating that these proteins have no dhfs activity.
in yeast,  xxxg814xxx  is essential for methionine biosynthesis and for
maintenance of mitochondrial dna (9). indeed, cells bearing
the met7⌬ mutation were methionine prototrophs and ‘‘petites,’’
i.e., the cells were respiration-deficient and unable to use ethanol
as a carbon source. the diploid cd180 (met7⌬兾met7) strain
was transformed with the prs-atdf plasmids, and the progeny
was analyzed on a medium lacking methionine (glucose as a
carbon source) and on medium containing ethanol as a carbon
source. spores disrupted for the met7 gene (trp⫹, met7:: xxxg1852xxx   xxxg2332xxx )
and expressing the atdfb, -c, or -d cdnas (ura⫹, presence of
the prs vector) did not require methionine for growth (fig. 2b).
these cells were also able to grow on a medium containing ethanol
as a carbon source, thus indicating that they are respirationcompetent (fig. 2b). these results are similar to that obtained
when a plasmid harboring the wild-type met7 gene is used to
transform the diploid cd180 (met7⌬兾met7) strain (fig. 2b; ref. 9),
thus indicating that the atdfb, -c, and -d cdnas encode three
isoforms of functional  xxxg814xxx . on the other hand, the expression of
the atdfa protein did not correct either the methionine requirement or the respiration-deficient phenotype (fig. 2b).
to validate the results described above, dhfs and  xxxg814xxx 
activities were determined in vitro by using protein extracts
prepared from the different strains. the dhfs activity detected
in cd208–2b ( fol3⌬) transformed with prs-atdfa (0.26 nmol
dihydrofolate formed per h兾mg of protein) is similar to that
measured in the parental fol3 strain (0.22 nmol兾h兾mg of
protein). because no activity could be detected for cd208–2b
( fol3⌬), this result confirmed that the atdfa cdna encodes a
functional dhfs enzyme. when  xxxg814xxx  was assayed by using
h4f-glu1 as a substrate, no activity could be detected in
ravanel et al.

activities were determined at 37°c as described under materials and
methods by using 100 ␮m h4f-glu1 and its derivatives. specific activities are
expressed in nmol兾h兾mg of protein. data are representative of 2–5 independent measurements. no activity was detected in the original cd180-5c
(met7⌬) strain by using h4f-glu1 as a substrate.

cd180–5c (met7⌬), as expected for a null mutation of the met7
gene (9). the activities measured in the met7⌬ cells expressing
atdfb, -c, or -d ranged from 0.08 to 0.30 nmol glutamate
incorporated per h兾mg of protein (table 1), thus confirming that
these proteins are functional  xxxg814xxx  enzymes. the three  xxxg814xxx 
isoforms from arabidopsis exhibited broad substrate specificity
because they were able to add glutamates to h4f-glu1 carrying
various c1 units (table 1). this property is characteristic for the
eukaryotic  xxxg814xxx  so far studied (1, 2).
subcellular localization of dhfs and  xxxg814xxx  isoforms. to analyze the
localization of dhfs and the three  xxxg814xxx  isoforms in the plant
cell, we prepared specific abs against each protein. intact
chloroplasts and mitochondria were purified on percoll density
gradients, thus providing organelles devoid of contamination
from the other compartments. also, a cytosolic-enriched fraction was prepared. preliminary experiments indicated that
dhfs and  xxxg814xxx  isoforms are soluble proteins in arabidopsis
(data not shown). soluble proteins from purified chloroplasts
(stroma), mitochondria (matrix), and the cytosolic-enriched
fractions were then analyzed by western blotting. abs raised
against the atdfa protein identified a 53-kda polypeptide in
the total cell protein extract and the mitochondrial matrix
fraction (fig. 3a). a similar pattern was obtained for the isoform
c of  xxxg814xxx , which had an estimated molecular mass of 66 kda
(fig. 3c). these results strongly suggest that in arabidopsis
dhfs and  xxxg814xxx  c are located in the matrix of mitochondria.
this localization is consistent with a previous study performed
in pea leaves (7), and the estimated mr of the mature proteins fits
well with the calculated molecular mass of the corresponding

by the atdfb abs in the total cell protein extract was also
detected in the stromal fraction, thus indicating that the isoform
b of  xxxg814xxx  is present in the chloroplast. the estimated molecular
mass was consistent with a transit peptide of ⬇25 residues. the
immunoblots probed with the abs raised against  xxxg814xxx  d
indicated that the protein is present in the cytosol (fig. 3d).
indeed, a 55-kda polypeptide that corresponds to the calculated
molecular mass for  xxxg814xxx  d is detected only in the total cell
protein extract and the cytosolic-enriched fraction.
as a complementary approach, the subcellular localization of
dhfs and  xxxg814xxx  isoforms was analyzed in vivo by using fusions
between the n terminus of the individual arabidopsis proteins
and a gfp marker protein. as shown in fig. 4d, the expression
of atdfd-gfp in arabidopsis protoplasts resulted in green
fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleus, a
pattern similar to the one observed with gfp alone. the
atdfb-gfp fusion protein colocalized with the red autofluorescence of chlorophyll (fig. 4b), a situation that is identical to
that obtained with gfp fused to the transit peptide of the
rubisco small subunit. this result demonstrates that  xxxg814xxx  b
contains a functional plastid-targeting presequence. the staining pattern obtained for gfp fused with either atdfa or -c was
consistent with a mitochondrial localization of these proteins

whereas enzyme 9 is found only in the cytosol. the occurrence of reaction 4 in
the cytosol is predicted from dna sequence data. the compartmentation of

fusion between gfp and the mitochondrial transit peptide of
hppk-dhps, and the green fluorescence of the atdfa and -c

isoform c of  xxxg814xxx  are mitochondrial proteins in arabidopsis.
discussion
plants have the ability to synthesize h4f-glun de novo from the
dihydropterin, para aminobenzoic acid, and glutamate precursors through the sequential operation of five enzymes, including
dhfs and  xxxg814xxx  (fig. 5). in pea leaf, neuburger et al. (7)
measured the five activities only in the mitochondria, suggesting
that these organelles play a major role in h4f-glun synthesis.
other biochemical and genetic studies supported the mitochondrial localization of hppk-dhps (26), dhfs (15), and  xxxg631xxx - xxxg2366xxx  (dhfr-ts; ref. 7).
also, the presence of dhfr-ts in the plastids (31) and  xxxg814xxx 
in the cytosol (16) have been reported.
in this study, a genomic-based approach allowed us to clone
a cdna coding dhfs in arabidopsis. the subcellular localization of dhfs in the mitochondria and the estimated molecular
mass of the mature protein (53 kda) corroborate previous data
concerning the plant enzyme (7, 15). also, this result definitely
demonstrates that the first three reactions of h4f-glun synthesis
catalyzed by the bifunctional hppk-dhps (26) and dhfs are
present only in the mitochondria (fig. 5). three cdnas coding
 xxxg814xxx  isoforms were also characterized, thus providing new
insights into the subcellular compartmentation of folate biosynthesis in the plant cell. the plant proteins resemble  xxxg814xxx  from
other organisms in having an n-terminal domain involved in
ravanel et al.

atp and mg2⫹ binding (catalytic site), and a c-terminal region
dedicated to the binding of the folate substrate (29). however,
there is a marked difference among plants, mammals, and fungi
regarding the organization of the genes coding  xxxg814xxx . in mammalian cells, a single gene encodes both the cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms of the enzyme by the use of alternate transcription
and translation starts (17). a similar situation has been proposed for
the met6 gene encoding  xxxg814xxx  in n. crassa (32). in s. cerevisiae, the
existence of a mitochondrial isoform of  xxxg814xxx  resulting from an
alternate translation start is still controversial (9, 10). in arabidopsis,
 xxxg814xxx  isoforms are encoded by separate genes (table 2), thus
suggesting that the expression of each protein may be controlled
separately through the interaction of transcriptional regulatory
elements to the corresponding promoter regions.
the most important finding from our studies of plant fpgss
concerns their cellular distribution. western blot analyses and
expression of gfp-fusion proteins in vivo have demonstrated for
the first time that each compartment of the plant cell containing
␥-glutamyl-conjugated h4f derivatives possesses one isoform of
the enzyme responsible for the extension of the glutamate side
chain of folate coenzymes. first, the localization of one  xxxg814xxx 
isoform in the mitochondria fits well with the biochemical data
reported by neuburger et al. (7), confirming that the mitochondrial compartment is the only one that contains the complete set
of enzymes required for de novo synthesis of h4f-glun (fig. 5).
on the other hand, the multicellular compartmentation of  xxxg814xxx 
in the plant cell is in agreement with the presence of folatedependent reactions in the cytosol, the mitochondria, and the
chloroplasts (fig. 5). serine hydroxymethyltransferase, the enzyme catalyzing the conversion of serine to glycine with the
concomitant formation of 5,10-ch2-h4f from unsubstituted
h4f, is found in these three compartments (33) and exhibits a
marked preference for polyglutamate coenzymes (6). also, the
mitochondria, the cytosol, and the chloroplast each contain a
parallel set of enzymes catalyzing the interconversion of 5,10ch2-, 5,10-ch⫹-, and 10-cho-substituted folate coenzymes (7,
34). thus, the occurrence of  xxxg814xxx  isoforms in the three main
compartments of the plant cell matches with the predominance
of glutamyl-conjugated h4f derivatives and the presence of

serine hydroxymethyltransferase and c1-interconverting enzymes in the cytosol, the mitochondria, and the plastids. because
serine is the principle source of c1 units in the plant cell (35),
the combination of these folate-mediated reactions can supply
each compartment with the polyglutamylated c1-substituted
h4f coenzymes required for their nucleotides and formylmethionyl-trna synthesis (fig. 5).
the complex compartmentation of folate-mediated reactions in
the plant cell implies the transport of h4f species between the
organelles via the cytosol. in mammalian cells, the traffic of folates
first involves the uptake of the monoglutamate species found in the
blood. once internalized, folates are either converted to polyglutamate forms to promote their retention in the cytosol or transported to the mitochondria where they are polyglutamylated to
minimize their diffusion out of the organelle. the transport systems
involved in the cellular uptake (36) and the translocation of folates
from the cytosol to the mitochondria (37) have been characterized
in mammals. nothing is known concerning the traffic of folate
coenzymes in the plant cell. the presence of  xxxg814xxx  isoforms in the
cytosol and the chloroplast strongly suggests that monoglutamate
folates, which are initially synthesized in the mitochondria, are the
transported forms. indeed, the presence of a glutamate tail markedly increases the anionic nature of folate coenzymes, thus impairing their diffusion through hydrophobic barriers (4). the reduction
status of the transported form(s) of folate has to be established.
mitochondria from rat liver have the ability to import oxidized
(folate, dihydrofolate) or reduced (5-cho- and 5-ch3-h4f) species from the cytosol (38, 39). in plants, the traffic of oxidized folates
would imply the presence of  xxxg631xxx -thymidylate
synthase (dhfr-ts) isoenzymes in the cytosol and the chloroplasts to reduce dihydro- to tetrahydrofolate before the addition of
glutamate residues by  xxxg814xxx . the presence of a dhfr-ts in the
plastids has been suggested by immunological techniques (31),
whereas the existence of a cytosolic isoform is supported only by
dna sequence data. the intracellular transport of reduced folates
is also questionable because of their sensitivity to oxidative degradation (40).
