abstract: sdh (l- xxxg2043xxx ,  xxxg1016xxx .17) catalyzes the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (plp)-dependent
dehydration of l-serine to yield pyruvate and ammonia. liver sdh plays an important role in
gluconeogenesis. formation of pyruvate by sdh is a two-step reaction in which the hydroxyl group of
serine is cleaved to produce aminoacrylate, and then the aminoacrylate is deaminated by nonenzymatic
hydrolysis to produce pyruvate. the crystal structure of rat liver apo-sdh was determined by single
isomorphous replacement at 2.8 å resolution. the holo-sdh crystallized with o-methylserine (oms)
was also determined at 2.6 å resolution by molecular replacement. sdh is composed of two domains,
and each domain has a typical rbeta-open structure. the active site is located in the cleft between the two
domains. the holo-sdh contained plp-oms aldimine in the active site, indicating that oms can form
the schiff base linkage with plp, but the subsequent dehydration did not occur. apo-sdh forms a dimer
by inserting the small domain into the catalytic cleft of the partner subunit so that the active site is closed.
holo-sdh also forms a dimer by making contacts at the back of the clefts so that the dimerization does
not close the catalytic cleft. the phosphate group of plp is surrounded by a characteristic g-rich sequence
(168ggggl172) and forms hydrogen bonds with the amide groups of those amino acid residues, suggesting
that the phosphate group can be protonated. n1 of plp participates in a hydrogen bond with cys303, and
similar hydrogen bonds with n1 participating are seen in other beta-elimination enzymes. these hydrogen
bonding schemes indicate that n1 is not protonated, and thus, the pyridine ring cannot take a quinone-like
structure. these characteristics of the bound plp suggest that sdh catalysis is not facilitated by forming
the resonance-stabilized structure of the plp-ser aldimine as seen in aminotransferases. a possible catalytic
mechanism involves the phosphate group, surrounded by the characteristic sequence, acting as a general
acid to donate a proton to the leaving hydroxyl group of serine.

sdh1 (l- xxxg2043xxx ,  xxxg1016xxx .17) catalyzes the
 xxxd3047xxx  (plp)-dependent dehydration of l-serine
to yield pyruvate and ammonia (1). rat liver sdh plays an
important role in gluconeogenesis because the enzyme
activity is induced remarkably by the consumption of highprotein diets, starvation, and other treatments (2). formation
of pyruvate by sdh is two-step reaction in which the
hydroxyl group of serine is cleaved to produce aminoacrylate,
and then the aminoacrylate is deaminated by nonenzymatic
hydrolysis to produce pyruvate, giving the overall reaction
shown below (3).

plp-dependent enzymes are classified into at least three
families (r, beta, and gamma) on the basis of their primary sequences
(4). sdh, which catalyzes r,beta-elimination, belongs to the
beta-family. the other members of this family include tryptophan synthase and o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (4). in
microorganisms, such as escherichia and saccharomyces,
and in plants, there are often two isozymes of sdhs: one
involved in the biodegradative pathway of serine (and
threonine) and the other involved in the isoleucine biosynthesis pathway when the microorganisms are cultured in
minimal medium. these sdhs are all composed of four
identical subunits with an mr in the range of 35200-63800
and are subject to allosteric regulation with amp as an
activator and isoleucine as an inhibitor (5, 6).
rat liver contains a relatively high concentration of sdh
among the mammalian livers examined so far, and the

crystal structure of  xxxg2043xxx  from rat liver
enzyme has been shown to be involved in gluconeogenesis
(7). the enzyme activity fluctuates depending on the
available nutrients and in response to the levels of various
hormones (2). the purified rat liver sdh is a dimer with an
mr ) 34 200 subunit (8-11). plp binds to lys41 to form a
schiff base, and the amino acid sequence (39sxkirg44) is
well-conserved among sdhs from rat (12), human (13),
tomato (14), escherichia coli (15, 16), and yeast (17). these
enzymes also have well-conserved sequences at 64sagn67
and a glycine-rich sequence at 168ggggl172 (7).
nine crystal structures of plp-dependent beta-elimination
enzymes have been determined. those are e. coli threonine
deaminase (18), salmonella typhimurium o-acetylserine
sulfhydrylase (19), synechocystis l-cystine c-s lyase (20),
e. coli selenocystine lyase (21), citrobacter freundii tyrosine
phenol-lyase (22), s. typhimurium tryptophan synthase (23),
proteus vulgaris  xxxg2256xxx  (24), human cystathionine
beta-synthase (25), and arabidopsis cystathionine beta-lyase (26).
threonine deaminase, o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase, tryptophan synthase, and  xxxg350xxx  also catalyze
the dehydration of serine. the e. coli threonine deaminase
has the same function as rat liver sdh, but the bacterial
enzyme is larger than the eukaryotic enzyme and is composed
of the plp-dependent catalytic domain and the regulatory
domain (18). the crystal structure of e. coli threonine
deaminase shows that the enzyme is a dimer of dimers and
the catalytic and the regulatory domains are separated and
have no interaction. the sequence of the catalytic domain is
27.7% identical with that of rat sdh. the beta-subunit of s.
typhimurium tryptophan synthase contains a plp and catalyzes the synthesis of tryptophan from serine and indole (23).
in the catalytic reaction, the substrate serine forms a plpser aldimine in the active site, and then the beta-elimination
reaction occurs to produce plp-aminoacrylate. the catalytic
domain structures of threonine deaminase and tryptophan
synthase are quite similar and are expected to be similar to
the structure of rat liver sdh.
here we report crystal structures of apo-sdh and plpoms aldimine-bound sdh. on the basis of these structures,
a detailed catalytic mechanism of sdh is proposed, in which
the resonance stabilization of plp-ser aldimine as observed
in aminotransferases is not involved.
experimental procedures
purification and crystallization procedures. sdh used in
this study is the recombinant rat enzyme produced in e. coli
bl21 transformed with the pcw-sdh plasmid that contains
the coding sequence of rat sdh cdna (27). the enzyme
was purified to homogeneity from e. coli extracts by
ammonium sulfate precipitation, dialysis in 10 mm potassium
phosphate buffer (ph 7.8) containing 5 mm cysteine,
followed by gel filtration over sephacryl s-200, and deaecellulose chromatography as described previously (27). this
procedure apparently removed the bound plp and k+ ion,
and thus, we obtained the apoenzyme. the holoenzyme was
prepared from the apoenzyme by incubation with 1 mm plp,
and the unbound plp was removed by passing the compound
through a sephadex g-50 column.
the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method was employed
for crystallization of the enzyme. crystals of the apoenzyme
were grown in a solution containing 50 mm tris-hcl buffer

biochemistry, vol. 42, no. 44, 2003 12855
(ph 7.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2% (w/v) peg-3350, and 20%
(v/v) ethylene glycol at a protein concentration of 10 mg/
ml at 26 °c. rice-shaped crystals suitable for x-ray
diffraction studies (∼0.4 mm × 0.2 mm × 0.1 mm) were
grown in a few days. crystals of the holoenzyme were grown
in a solution containing 50 mm hepes buffer (ph 8.0), 10
mm dl-o-methylserine (oms), 200 mm  xxxd2987xxx ,
1 mm dithiothreitol, 14% (w/v) peg-8000, and 2% 1,4dioxane at a protein concentration of 20 mg/ml at 22 °c.
needle-shaped crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction studies
(∼0.5 mm × 0.05 mm × 0.05 mm) were grown overnight.
data measurement. a crystal (0.4 mm × 0.2 mm × 0.1
mm) of the apoenzyme in a hanging drop was scooped up
with a nylon loop and was dipped into a cryoprotectant
solution containing 20% ethylene glycol, 50 mm tris-hcl
buffer (ph 7.0), and 5% (w/v) peg-3350 for 30 s before
the crystal was frozen in cold nitrogen gas (-180 °c) on a
rigaku raxis imaging plate x-ray diffractometer with a
rotating anode x-ray generator as an x-ray source (cu kr
radiation operated at 50 kv and 100 ma). the x-ray beam
was focused to 0.3 mm by confocal optics (osmic, inc.).
the diffraction data were measured up to 2.8 å resolution
at -180 °c. the data were processed with the program
denzo/scalepack (28). the data statistics are given
in table 1. data for the holoenzyme were obtained using a
crystal (0.5 mm × 0.05 mm × 0.05 mm) with the same
method used for the apoenzyme data measurement. the
composition of the cryoprotectant for the holoenzyme was
20% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 50 mm hepes buffer (ph 8.0),
200 mm  xxxd2987xxx , and 16% (w/v) peg-8000.
the platinum derivative crystals were prepared by the
soaking method; native crystals of the apoenzyme were
incubated in an artificial mother liquor containing 50 mm
tris-hcl buffer (ph 7.0), 1 mm dtt, 5% (w/v) peg-3350,
20% (v/v) ethylene glycol, and 1 mm k2ptcl4 for 10 min
before they were frozen in liquid nitrogen. the diffraction
data were measured up to 3.2 å resolution at -180 °c and
were processed with the same method used for the native
data.
determination of the crystal structure of apo-sdh. the
unit cell dimensions and the assigned space indicated that
the asymmetric unit contains six subunits with a vm of 2.80
å3. a difference patterson map [(fph - fp)2 map] showed
significant peaks corresponding to the pt-pt vectors. twelve
pt positions in the asymmetric unit were determined by using
the program cns (29). the 12 pt positions indicated that
the six subunits are related by pseudo-32 symmetry. initial
protein phases were determined from the single isomorphous
replacement (sir) data in conjunction with solvent flattening
using the programs in cns. the electron density map was
averaged by the pseudo-32 symmetry calculated from the
pt positions. the averaged electron density map showed three
sdh dimers in an asymmetric unit. in each subunit, the main
chains of 290 of 327 amino acid residues were traced
continuously without any difficulty.
the crystal structure was refined by a standard refinement
procedure in the cns protocol with the noncrystallographic
symmetry restraint. six subunits were restrained to have
similar conformations (i.e., rmsd < 0.08 å). refinement of
isotropic temperature factors for individual atoms was carried
out by the individual b-factor refinement procedure of cns
using bond and angle restraints. during the final refinement

stage, well-defined residual electron density peaks in difference maps were assigned to water molecules if peaks were
able to bind to the protein molecules with hydrogen bonds.
the final crystallographic r-factor was 0.222 for observed
data (no sigma cutoff) from 25 to 2.8 å resolution. rfree for the
randomly selected data (10%) equals 0.248.
determination of the crystal structure of sdh-(plpoms). the unit cell dimensions and space group indicated
that an asymmetric unit contained four subunits with a vm
of 2.46 å3. the crystal structure was determined by a
molecular replacement procedure using cns (29).  xxxg220xxx 
in the apo-sdh was used as the search model. the structure
was refined with the simulated annealing procedure of cns.
the 2fo - fc maps calculated after refinement showed that
several sections of the polypeptide had conformations
different from those of the apoenzyme. the models of these
amino acid sections were built in 2fo - fc maps. fo - fc
maps showed a large significant residual electron density
peak in the region of the active site. since sdh was
crystallized in the presence of oms (10 mm), plp-oms
aldimine was fitted into the electron density peak. other welldefined residual electron density peaks in fo - fc maps were
assigned to water molecules if peaks were able to bind the
protein molecules with hydrogen bonds. one peak in each
subunit that was significantly higher than those of water
molecules was assigned to a potassium ion since the crystals
were grown in a solution containing potassium ions (200
mm  xxxd2987xxx ). the final model was refined by the
simulated annealing procedure, and followed by the indi-

vidual b-factor refinement procedure of cns using bond and
angle restraints. during the refinement, the four subunits
related by a noncrystallographic symmetry were tightly
restrained to have the same structure in an effort to increase
the accuracy of coordinates. the final crystallographic
r-factor was 0.231 for observed data (no sigma cutoff) from 25
to 2.6 å resolution. rfree for the randomly selected data (10%)
equals 0.261. the coordinates have been deposited in the
protein data bank (entries 1pwe and 1pwh). crystallographic parameters are listed in table 1.
determination of molecular weights in solution by
dynamic light scattering. the molecular sizes and weights
of the apo- and holoenzymes in solution were determined
by using a dynamic light scattering apparatus (dynapro,
protein solution, inc.). the apo- and holoenzymes (20 mg/
ml) used for the above crystallization experiment were
diluted in 50 mm tris-hcl buffer (ph 7.0) or 50 mm
potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.0) to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. the dynamic light scatterings from the
samples were measured at 20 and 30 °c, respectively. the
data were analyzed with the associated program (dynamics,
version 5.25.44). the results are listed in table 2.

have been determined successfully. sdh is composed of two
domains (the large domain being residues 1-35 and 137327 and the small domain being residues 36-136). each
domain has an rbeta-open structure (figure 1). the active site
is located between the domains. although the overall
structures of apo- and holoenzymes are quite similar to each
other, they fold into different dimers (figure 2).
active site geometry. the active site of sdh-(plpoms) contains plp-oms aldimine, indicating that oms
reacted with the bound plp in the active site but the catalytic
reaction was stopped after formation of the schiff base
(figure 3). the bound plp-oms aldimine is mostly planar
except for the phosphate group and the side chain of oms
(ch2och3) (figure 4). the phosphate moiety of the bound
plp-oms aldimine is surrounded by five amide groups of
the conserved amino acid residues (168ggggl172). the two
oxygens (o1p and o2p) of the phosphate group form two
hydrogen bonds with the amide groups of gly168, gly170,
gly171, and leu172, and the third oxygen (o3p) has one
hydrogen bond with the amide group of gly169, suggesting
that the third oxygen can be protonated. similarly, the
carboxylate moiety is surrounded by the other conserved
amino acid residues (64sagna68) and is involved in three
hydrogen bonds with ser64 og, ala65 n, and asn67 n
(figure 4). it is noteworthy that both negatively charged
groups are in noncharged environments. lys41, which forms
a schiff base linkage with the bound plp, is located above
the plp plane, and its nz has a relatively short contact (2.7
å) with the plp c4′. the nz is involved in hydrogen bonds
with plp o3 and oms o. judging from the hydrogen
bonding scheme, we find nz is neutral (i.e., -nh2) and is
the group that abstracts the r-hydrogen from ca of the plpoms aldimine. n1 of plp is involved in a hydrogen bond

with the hs group of cys303. a potassium ion is coordinated
by six oxygen atoms (gly168 o, ala198 o, leu223 o,
val225 o, glu194 oe2, and ser200 og) near the active site.
the major function of this ion is apparently to build the
framework of the active site, but the ion is not involved in
catalysis. similar k+ ions were found in the structures of
beta-elimination enzymes, tryptophan synthase (23) and  xxxg2256xxx  (24). as discussed below, the structure of the
apoenzyme does not contain the k+ ion in the active site,
and the polypeptide conformation from residue 193 to residue
234 is significantly different from that of the holoenzyme.
model sdh-plp and sdh-(plp-ser) structures. on
the basis of the sdh-(plp-oms) structure, the model
structures before and after serine binding to the active site
were built (figure 5a,b). we assume that the bound plp
has the same interactions as seen in the sdh-(plp-oms)
structure. for the sdh-plp model, the oms was removed,
and the conformation of the side chain of lys41 was changed
so that nz can form a schiff base linkage with c4′ of bound
plp. since the nz-c4′ distance was still longer than the
ideal cdn distance (1.34 å), the plp was tilted by 6° at
the center of n1 toward nz without breaking any hydrogen
bonds (figure 5a). for the sdh-(plp-ser) model, the
och3 group of oms was replaced with an oh group, and
the ca-cb bond was rotated by -133° so that og can form
two hydrogen bonds with o of ala222 and protonated o3p
of phosphate (figure 5b).
measurement of molecular sizes by dynamic light scattering. dynamic light scattering measurements indicate that
the apo- and holoenzymes form a dimer in a 50 mm trishcl buffer solution (ph 7.0) at 20 and 30 °c. however, in
a 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer solution (ph 7.0), the
apoenzyme becomes a monomer at 30 °c, while the
holoenzyme is still dimers. the results indicate that the apoand holoenzymes form different dimers and the apo dimer
is unstable in solution containing a high concentration of
k+ ion. this is consistent with the crystal structures described
above.
discussion
apo- and holoenzymes form different dimers. in the
apoenzyme structure, the two subunits form a dimer related

by noncrystallographic 2-fold symmetry (figure 2a). in the
dimer structure, the small domain is rotated by 7.2° to open
the active site cleft, and the small domain of the partner
subunit enters the opened cleft. since the small domain of

the partner subunit blocks the entrance to the active site, the
enzyme is an inactive form. similar dimerization is seen in
the structure of plp-dependent alanine racemase (31). in the
sdh-(plp-oms) structure, two subunits form a dimer by

making contacts at the back of the two clefts so that the
entrance of the active site is open, and thus, the enzyme is
an active form. similar dimerization is seen in the structure
of e. coli threonine deaminase which is a tetramer (dimer
of dimers) related by a crystallographic 222 symmetry (18).
compared with the subunits of the holoenzyme dimer, the
subunits in the apoenzyme dimer interact extensively. the
major difference between the apo- and holoenzyme is seen
in the polypeptide conformation of residues 197-228, which
do not interact with the bound plp. as shown in figure 6,
the two polypeptides fold completely differently. when the
holoenzyme loses the cofactor plp and k+ ion, residues
197-228 undergo a large conformational change to evacuate
the site that residues 105-124 of the partner subunit will
occupy. the subunits of the holoenzyme cannot form a dimer
similar to that seen in the apoenzyme, but the subunits of

the apoenzyme can form a dimer similar to that seen in the
holoenzyme, suggesting that the apo-type dimer is more
stable than the holo-type dimer. the bound plp and k+ ion
readily dissociate from the enzyme by simple dialysis in the
presence of cysteine (32), suggesting the presence of the apotype dimers in cells.
the mammalian liver enzymes are involved in gluconeogenesis, whereas the microorganism enzymes are involved
mainly in isoleucine biosynthesis. the e. coli enzyme
(threonine deaminase) is composed of the catalytic and
regulatory domains, and is regulated by feedback regulation
(i.e., inhibited by the end product isoleucine). the regulation
scheme of the mammalian liver enzyme is unknown. as
described above, rat liver sdh forms two different dimers,
and the bound plp readily dissociates from sdh in the
presence of  xxxd1788xxx . when the  xxxd1788xxx  level is

bonds between plp-oms aldimine and sdh are represented by thin lines. (b) schematic diagram showing the interaction of plp-oms
aldimine in the active site. dashed lines represent the possible hydrogen bonds.

relatively high in the cell, the rat liver sdh loses the bound
plp and k+ ion and shifts the conformational equilibrium
to the apo-type conformation. the apoenzymes are stabilized
by forming the new type of dimer. this study suggests that
the level of  xxxd1788xxx  would regulate the liver enzyme.
beta-elimination enzymes are divided into two groups.
crystal structures of nine plp-dependent beta-elimination
enzymes are known. these are e. coli threonine deaminase
(18), o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (19), rat sdh (this study),
l-cystine c-s lyase (20), selenocystine lyase (21), tyrosine

phenol-lyase (22), the beta-subunit of tryptophan synthase (23),
p. vulgaris  xxxg2256xxx  (24), human  xxxg350xxx  (25), and arabidopsis cystathionine beta-lyase (26). the
overall structures of the plp-binding domains of these
enzymes are quite similar to each other. however, as shown
in table 3, these enzymes are clearly divided into two groups
when the structures are compared to the sdh structure.
for the following discussion, it is important to determine
whether n1 of the bound plp is protonated. since sg of
cys303 is located near the c4-n1 vector of the bound plp

with a sg‚‚‚n1 distance of 2.96 å and a cb-sg‚‚‚n1 angle
of 89°, sg forms a hydrogen bond with n1. also, sg of
cys303 has a short contact (3.57 å) with sg of cys270 which
forms a hydrogen bond with the amide group of gly304 (s‚
‚‚n distance of 3.41 å). under neutral conditions, sg of
cys303 forms a s-h‚‚‚n hydrogen bond with n1. thus,
n1 of the bound plp is not protonated. however, since the
hydrogen of the sulfhydryl group of cysteine can be
dissociated, we cannot exclude an -s‚‚‚h-n+ hydrogen
bond in a basic environment. as will be described below, a
serine residue is located at the same site of cys303 in the

structures of threonine deaminase (18), tryptophan synthase
(23), o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (19), and cystathionine
beta-synthase (25). the ca-cb-og moieties of the serine
residues are located at the same place as the ca-cb-sg
moiety of cys303, and thus, the og groups participate in a
hydrogen bond with n1 of the bound plp. since the
hydrogen of the hydroxyl group of serine residue cannot be
dissociated, it is possible to determine whether the hydrogen
bond is of the ser oh‚‚‚n plp or ser ho‚‚‚hn+ plp form
by examining the hydrogen bonding scheme around the
serine residue. a careful examination of the hydrogen bond

(aquamarine) and holoenzyme (magenta). amino acid residues 105-124 of the partner subunit of the apoenzyme are shown in white.

networks around the serine residues in the structures of
threonine deaminase, tryptophan synthase, o-acetylserine
sulfhydrylase, and  xxxg350xxx  indicates that the
hydrogen bond between the serine and the bound plp is an
oh‚‚‚n bond and n1 is not protonated. since serine and
cysteine are structurally similar and the catalytic functions
of sdh, threonine deaminase, tryptophan synthase, oacetylserine sulfhydrylase, and  xxxg350xxx  are
the same (i.e., these enzymes catalyze the cleavage of the
cb-og bond of serine), it is reasonable to conclude that n1
of the bound plp in the sdh structure is not protonated.
threonine deaminase, tryptophan synthase, o-acetylserine
sulfhydrylase,  xxxg350xxx , and sdh belong to
the first group for the following reasons. (1) their structures
are very similar because more than 84% of the ca atoms of
sdh superimpose on their ca atoms. (2) the n1 atoms of
plp are nonprotonated because the hydrogen bond partner
of the n1 atoms is a neutral amino acid residue. (3) the
phosphate groups are in the less polarized form (hpo4-)
because they are surrounded mainly by backbone amide
groups and not charged amino acids. (4) all these enzymes
catalyze the cleavage of the cb-o bond of ser/thr.
l-cystine c-s lyase, selenocystine lyase, tyrosine phenollyase,  xxxg2256xxx , and cystathionine beta-lyase belong to the
second group for the following reasons. (1) their similarities
to sdh are relatively poor because less than 21% of the ca
atoms of sdh superimpose on their ca atoms. (2) the n1
atoms of plp are protonated because the hydrogen bond
partner of the n1 atoms is a negatively charged amino acid
residue. (3) the phosphate groups are in the more polarized
form (po42-) because the environment surrounding the
phosphate groups contains positively charged amino acid
residues and fewer backbone amide groups. (4) these
enzymes catalyze cleavage of the cb-s or cb-c bond.
it has been believed that n1 of the plp pyridine is
protonated by an acidic amino acid residue, and thus, the
pyridine ring of plp can form the quinone-like resonance
structure. the r-hydrogen of the plp-amino acid aldimine
is readily abstracted by a basic residue (schiff base lys)
because the resulting carbanion can form the resonancestabilized structure, whereas n1 of the plp pyridine is not
protonated in the structures of sdh, threonine deaminase,
tryptophan synthase, o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase, and  xxxg350xxx . the r-hydrogen abstraction is not as
easy as in the cases with protonated pyridine because the

resulting carbanion cannot form the resonance-stabilized
structure. therefore, an additional mechanism for stimulating
r-hydrogen abstraction is required. this mechanism is most
likely cleavage of the cb-o bond by a strong acid. as
described above, it is reasonably assumed that sdh, threonine deaminase, tryptophan synthase, o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase, and  xxxg350xxx  use the same catalytic mechanism to cleave the cb-o bond and have the same
essential amino acid residue (a strong acid) for cleavage of
the cb-o bond. such an amino acid residue should be
located near serine of the plp-ser aldimine in the structures
of sdh, threonine deaminase, tryptophan synthase, and
o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase. since the published structures
of threonine deaminase, o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase, and
 xxxg350xxx  do not contain the plp-ser aldimine, these structures are not used for this analysis. two
groups have determined the crystal structures of tryptophan
synthase containing a plp-ser aldimine. rhee et al. mutated
the schiff base lysine (lys87) to threonine and trapped a
plp-ser aldimine in the active site of the mutated enzyme
(33). og of the plp-ser aldimine is involved in two
hydrogen bonds (ogh‚‚‚od1 asp305 and ala112 nh‚‚‚og).
the beta-elimination reaction could not occur in this geometry
because the amide group cannot be a sufficiently strong acid
to donate a proton to the leaving og. furthermore, asp305
is not conserved in the structure of sdh (the corresponding
amino acid is gly224). therefore, the structure of k87t
mutant tryptophan synthase does not suggest any essential
amino acid residue for cleavage of the cb-o bond. the
second group, schneider et al., trapped a plp-aminoacrylate
aldimine in the active site by using an inhibitor, 5-fluoroindole  xxxd3026xxx  phosphate, under steady state conditions (34).
the amino acid residues in the active site are the same as
those of the k87t mutant enzyme except for lys87 and
asp305. the side chain of asp305 is oriented in the opposite
direction and away from the serine. this structure indicates
again that asp305 is not the essential amino acid residue.
in conclusion, there is no amino acid residue that can act as
a strong acid to donate a proton to the leaving og of serine.
as will be explained below, we propose that the phosphate
group of plp surrounded by backbone amide groups acts
as a strong acid to donate a proton to og of serine. the other
possible strong acid would be the schiff base lysine if a
relatively large conformational change were allowed.

figure 7: proposed catalytic mechanism of sdh. arrows indicate movement of electrons. possible hydrogen bonds are represented by
dashed lines. (1) a serine molecule enters the active site. the amino group forms a hydrogen bond with the phosphate. the proton in the
hydrogen bond moves to the phosphate. the amino group becomes a nucleophile. (2) the amino group attacks the enzyme-plp schiff
base carbon atom (c4′) to produce the ternary complex intermediate (geminal diamine intermediate). (3) lys41 is released from the plp,
and plp-ser aldimine is produced. the phosphate group acts as a general acid to donate the proton to og of the serine molecule. abstraction
of the r-hydrogen from ca by lys41 occurs in a concerted fashion. (4) a water molecule is released, and the plp-aminoacrylate intermediate
is produced. (5) lys41 approaches c4′, and the ternary complex intermediate is formed. (6) aminoacrylate is released, and the enzymeplp schiff base is re-formed.

it is noted that scarselli et al. (35) have proposed a model
structure of rat sdh based on the crystal structure of e. coli
threonine deaminase. although the phosphate pocket geometry agrees with this crystal structure, the other important
amino acid residues do not correspond with those found in
this crystal structure, suggesting a limitation of the molecular
modeling.
proposed catalytic mechanism of sdh. on the basis of
the crystal structure of sdh-(plp-oms) along with the
characteristic amino acid sequence of sdh, the model
structures of sdh-plp and sdh-(plp-ser), and the
crystal structures of tryptophan synthase discussed above, a
possible sdh catalytic mechanism is described below and
illustrated in figure 7.
(1) in the holoenzyme, lys41 is located above the plp
plane, and its nz is connected to c4′ of plp by a schiff
base linkage. the phosphate group of plp is in a pocket
composed of the conserved g-rich section (168ggggl172).
a serine molecule enters the active site with its positively
charged amino group pointing to the negatively charged
phosphate group of plp, and approaches the plp along the

plane of plp, which is an ideal geometry for formation of
the plp-ser aldimine.
(2) initially, the amino group of serine forms a hydrogen
bond with the phosphate, and the proton in the hydrogen
bond moves to the phosphate. the phosphate is protonated,
and the amino group becomes a nucleophile. the nucleophilic amino group attacks the enzyme-plp schiff base
carbon atom (c4′) to form a plp-ser aldimine and to release
the neutral lys41 from the bound plp.
(3) the carboxylate group of serine is bound to the
conserved section (64sagna68) of the protein, while the
hydroxyl group (ogh) participates in two hydrogen bonds
(ogh‚‚‚o ala222 and plp o3ph‚‚‚og).
(4) since n1 of plp is not protonated, the pyridine ring
cannot take a quinone-like structure. therefore, abstraction
of the r-hydrogen from ca of serine by lys41 would not
occur. however, since the o3ph group can act as a general
acid to donate the proton to og of serine, abstraction of the
r-hydrogen from ca by lys41 occurs in a concerted fashion.
this catalytic reaction produces water and a plp-aminoacrylate intermediate.

12864 biochemistry, vol. 42, no. 44, 2003
(5) lys41 approaches c4′ and forms a schiff base linkage
to the plp, and aminoacrylate is released.
(6) the released aminoacrylate is deaminated to pyruvate
by nonenzymatic hydrolysis.
differences between sdh and aminotransferase. plp is
involved in a variety of enzyme reactions such as transamination, decarboxylation, isomerization, and elimination (36).
these plp-dependent enzymes have similar overall structures. when the environments around the plp-amino acid
aldimine in the sdh and aminotransferase (37) structures
are compared, there are three major differences.
(1) the ring n1 in sdh is involved in a hydrogen bond
with cys and is neutral (n‚‚‚h-s); on the other hand, in
aminotransferases, the hydrogen bond partner of n1 is asp/
glu, and thus, n1 is protonated (+n-h‚‚‚o-).
(2) the phosphate group in sdh is in a neutral environment and thus is less polarized (i.e., hpo3-), whereas in
aminotransferases, the phosphate group interacts with positively charged amino acid residues (arg/lys) and thus is
polarized (i.e., po32-).
(3) the carboxylate group in sdh is in a neutral
environment and thus is less polarized, whereas the carboxylate group in aminotransferases interacts with positively
charged amino acid residues (arg/lys) and thus is polarized.
these differences apparently determine beta-elimination for
sdh and the deamination for aminotransferases. in the
aminotransferases, the protonated pyridine ring can assume
a quinone-like structure and participate in the resonance
stabilization of the carbanion on ca. n1 to the carbonyl
oxygen of the amino acid can participate in resonance
stabilization because the aldimine is mainly planar and the
carboxylate is polarized by surrounding positively charged
amino acid residues (arg/lys). eventually, the carbanion
reacts with a water molecule, and the plp-amino acid
carbanion becomes pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate and a keto
acid to complete the deaminase reaction.
for sdh, since n1 in sdh is not protonated, the pyridine
ring cannot assume a quinone-like structure. furthermore,
the carboxylate group is less polarized. for these reasons,
the carbanion on ca is not stabilized by the resonance
structure observed in the aminotransferases. therefore, it is
more difficult to abstract the r-hydrogen from the amino
acid in the aldimine. as we proposed above, the phosphate
group surrounded by the characteristic amino acid sequence
(168ggggl172) becomes a strong general acid and donates
a proton to the leaving og of serine. consequently, the
r-hydrogen is readily abstracted by lys41, and the plpser aldimine becomes the plp-aminoacrylate aldimine.
