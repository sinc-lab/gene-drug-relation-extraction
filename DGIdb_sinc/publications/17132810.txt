 xxxd2088xxx : a selective  xxxg2431xxx  inhibitor for the
treatment of hyperuricemia and gout
susan p bruce

objective:

to review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical trial data, safety profile, precautions, and place in therapy of
 xxxd2088xxx , a novel nonpurine  xxxg2431xxx  inhibitor in development for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout.

data sources:

available studies and abstracts were identified through medline (1990–november 2006), science citation index,
international pharmaceutical abstracts, cochrane databases, and the american college of rheumatology and european league
against rheumatism web sites. key search terms were  xxxd2088xxx ,  xxxd2088xxx ,  xxxd2088xxx , hyperuricemia, and gout.
study selection and data extraction: all available studies describing the pharmacology of  xxxd2088xxx  were included. human
studies formed the basis for discussion of clinical parameters, including pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and safety
of  xxxd2088xxx .
data synthesis:  xxxd2088xxx  significantly reduces  xxxd3472xxx  levels within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy and up to 48% by the end
of 104 weeks of therapy. approximately 60% of patients achieved the primary goal of serum  xxxd3472xxx  less than 6 mg/dl during the
last 3 months following once-daily administration of  xxxd2088xxx  80 mg or 120 mg for at least 52 weeks. the most common adverse
reactions to  xxxd2088xxx  were abnormal results from liver function tests, diarrhea, headache, arthralgias, and musculoskeletal
symptoms. due to its potency, patients are at an increased risk of experiencing gout flares for at least the first year of therapy. up to
70% of patients in clinical trials experienced gout flares despite concomitant prophylactic treatment with colchicine or naproxen.
additional clinical trial evidence supports the efficacy and safety of  xxxd2088xxx  in the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout.
conclusions:  xxxd2088xxx  is a promising alternative to allopurinol for the treatment of gout and hyperuricemia. the optimal length of

prophylactic therapy, clinical significance of abnormal liver function tests results during therapy, and safety in patients with moderate
or severe renal insufficiency warrant further investigation.
key words:  xxxd2088xxx , gout, hyperuricemia,  xxxg2431xxx  inhibitor.

he underlying pathogenesis of gout is well known and
the approach to its treatment has remained unchanged
for many years. high  xxxd3472xxx  levels correlate with hypertension, glucose intolerance, and increased cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality, in addition to  xxxd3472xxx  crystal deposits within the joints in the form of a gout attack,
urolithiasis, and tophi.1 gout primarily affects middle-aged

prevalence of gout may be increasing in postmenopausal
women secondary to increased use of diuretics for treatment of hypertension, specifically hydrochlorothiazide, or
the use of diuretics in patients with renal insufficiency.2
the mainstay of treatment for an acute gout attack is either colchicine or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
(nsaids) such as indomethacin or naproxen. for frequent
gout attacks in patients with risk factors for recurrent attacks, prophylactic therapy may be necessary. reducing
 xxxd3472xxx  levels through prophylactic therapy reduces the
likelihood of recurrent gout by 80%.1 probenecid and

 xxxd3256xxx  are prophylactic options for patients who
overproduce  xxxd3472xxx ; however, adverse effects, limited
availability, and cumbersome patient administration instructions (ie, consumption of 10–12 glasses of liquid daily) limit their use. considering the drawbacks associated
with probenecid and  xxxd3256xxx , most clinicians prefer
allopurinol for prophylaxis of gout.2
allopurinol therapy is not without limitations. less than
0.5% of patients develop a serious hypersensitivity reaction to allopurinol. if use of allopurinol is necessary, these
patients must undergo a lengthy desensitization regimen
before rechallenge.3 further, renal impairment may influence the safety (eg, hypersensitivity reaction) and efficacy
of allopurinol. in one study, 57 of 68 patients (83%) experiencing allopurinol hypersensitivity had renal insufficiency.4 until additional studies are available to clarify the association between renal function and allopurinol hypersensitivity, clinicians are advised to closely monitor laboratory
parameters and adjust the dose accordingly to minimize
adverse events. available evidence suggests that lowering
the allopurinol dose to match the acceptable creatinine
clearance (clcr) level does not sufficiently lower  xxxd3472xxx 
levels in 57% of patients.5 another study aimed to determine the adherence to serum creatinine monitoring during
allopurinol therapy.6 twenty-five percent of the 4357 patients studied did not have a record of routine monitoring
of serum creatinine levels. the authors concluded that patients were at an increased risk of allopurinol-related toxicity due to the lack of monitoring and associated dosage adjustments.
 xxxd2088xxx , a nonpurine selective  xxxg2431xxx  inhibitor, received an approvable letter from the food and
drug administration (fda) in october 2005. if full approval is granted,  xxxd2088xxx  will represent a potential
treatment alternative for patients unable to tolerate allopurinol, patients with an inadequate response to allopurinol, and patients with renal insufficiency. the objectives of
this article are to review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and clinical trial evidence of the efficacy and safety
of  xxxd2088xxx , and to describe its potential place in the
treatment of hyperuricemia and gout.

pharmacology
 xxxg2431xxx  is an enzyme responsible for the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to urate,
the final steps in purine metabolism in humans.  xxxg2390xxx , an
enzyme involved in the continued degradation of urate, is
present in other species and may explain why gout and hyperuricemia are prevalent in humans only. consumption of
foods high in purines (organ meats, seafood, alcohol), coupled with an increased endogenous production of  xxxd3472xxx 
or high rate of renal urate reabsorption, leads to hyperuricemia and, in many patients, gout. categorizing a patient as an overproducer or underexcretor of  xxxd3472xxx  may
be determined through collection and evaluation of a 24
hour urinary urate excretion. the test has limitations: it
does not identify patients who both overproduce and underexcrete  xxxd3472xxx  or identify an overproducer if the patient has a low clcr (<60 ml/min).2 due to these limitations, many clinicians choose a  xxxg2431xxx  inhibitor
to reduce  xxxd3472xxx  levels.  xxxg2431xxx  inhibitors are
effective in patients who overproduce and underexcrete
 xxxd3472xxx .1,2
 xxxd2088xxx  ( xxxd2088xxx ,  xxxd2088xxx , tap pharmaceuticals) is a new nonpurine selective  xxxg2431xxx  inhibitor. the active ingredient is 2-(3-cyano- 4-[2-methylpropoxy]phenyl)- 4-methylthiazole-5-carboxylic acid. the
empiric formula is  xxxd2088xxx  and its molecular weight
is 316.38.7 the structure of  xxxd2088xxx  is unlike that of allopurinol because  xxxd2088xxx  does not resemble a pyrimidine or purine. the mechanism of action of  xxxd2088xxx  differs from that of allopurinol by its selectivity.  xxxd2088xxx  is
selective for the enzyme  xxxg2431xxx , whereas allopurinol inhibits other enzymes (orotidine-5′-monophosphate decarboxylase,  xxxg1792xxx ,
 xxxg880xxx , hypoxanthine–guanine phosphoribosyltransferase,  xxxg2388xxx ) involved
in purine and pyrimidine metabolism. it is thought that
some of the adverse reactions associated with allopurinol
may be due to its nonselectivity and structural similarity to
naturally occurring purines or pyrimidines.7,8
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics

data sources
literature searches, limited to studies published in english, were conducted in medline (1990 –november
2006), science citation index, international pharmaceutical abstracts, and cochrane databases, using search terms
 xxxd2088xxx ,  xxxd2088xxx ,  xxxd2088xxx , hyperuricemia, and gout.
only human studies were evaluated for safety and efficacy
of  xxxd2088xxx . additionally, searches on national and international rheumatology association web sites (american
college of rheumatology and european league against
rheumatism) yielded data available in abstract form only.

following oral administration of  xxxd2088xxx , approximately 85% of the drug is absorbed. the time to maximum
concentration is approximately one hour. the maximum
concentration and area under the curve (auc) increase
proportionally to the dose administered.  xxxd2088xxx  is
highly protein bound (99.2%), primarily to albumin, has a
volume of distribution of 0.7 l/kg, and has a half-life of
approximately 8 hours.9  xxxd2088xxx  is metabolized to acylglucuronide metabolites in the liver, and a small portion of
the parent compound undergoes oxidative metabolism by

terohepatic recirculation.10 table 1 compares the pharmacokinetic profiles of  xxxd2088xxx  and allopurinol.7,9-12
in healthy volunteers,  xxxd2088xxx  10–240 mg administered once daily over a 2 week period resulted in a doselinear serum  xxxd3472xxx  reduction of 25–70%.10 the
reduction occurred rapidly during the study period and appeared to plateau at 120 mg. following 4 weeks of  xxxd2088xxx  therapy in patients with gout or hyperuricemia, the pharmacokinetic parameters mentioned above were not statistically or clinically different from those of healthy volunteers.
the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of
varying degrees of renal and hepatic impairment were also
evaluated. ten patients with mild (clcr 50–80 ml/min) to
moderate (clcr 30–50 ml/min) renal impairment receiving
a single dose of  xxxd2088xxx  had a slight and insignificant
increase in auc compared with 5 patients with normal renal function (clcr >80 ml/min).13 mild adverse reactions
(nausea, constipation, gastric ulcer, headache, upper respiratory tract infection) were noted; only nausea was deemed
possibly related to  xxxd2088xxx  use. in a follow-up study, 20
patients were stratified to groups labeled as mild, moderate, or severe renal dysfunction.14 all received  xxxd2088xxx 
80 mg once daily for 7 days. no significant pharmacodynamic or adverse drug reaction changes were noted. in a separate study, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of 7 patients with severe renal impairment (clcr
10–29 ml/min) receiving  xxxd2088xxx  80 mg were neither statistically nor clinically significantly altered.9 the investigators of both studies concluded that renal impairment should
have no impact on the efficacy and safety of  xxxd2088xxx .9,13
patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment receiving multiple once-daily doses of  xxxd2088xxx  did not
have statistically or clinically significant differences in
pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters.15 the
safety and efficacy of  xxxd2088xxx  in patients with severe
hepatic impairment has not been studied; therefore, it

would be prudent to avoid its use in this population until
additional data are available.
clinical trials
studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of  xxxd2088xxx  in vitro and in animals provided a strong foundation
for clinical trials evaluating its use in humans.16-21 animal
data demonstrated that  xxxd2088xxx  was more potent than allopurinol in reducing  xxxd3472xxx  levels and the increased potency did not result in additional adverse events.16-19  xxxd2088xxx  was evaluated in humans during phase ii and iii trials; however, most of the data are available in abstract
form only.22-25 the studies reported in abstract form were designed to determine the optimal dose of  xxxd2088xxx , the efficacy of colchicine prophylaxis to prevent acute gout flares,
and the long-term (2 y) efficacy and safety of  xxxd2088xxx . patients are at an increased risk of experiencing gout flares following initiation of  xxxd2088xxx  secondary to the rapid reduction in serum  xxxd3472xxx  and subsequent mobilization of uric
acid stores induced by  xxxd2088xxx  therapy.18,20 the investigators in the early trials concluded that patients receiving  xxxd2088xxx  will require concomitant colchicine prophylaxis for 3
months or more to reduce the incidence of acute gout flares.
the risk of gout flares decreases gradually; however, the optimal length of prophylactic therapy has not been determined.24 specific trial information is listed in table 2.22-28
phase ii

becker et al.26 conducted a trial to evaluate the safety
and efficacy of  xxxd2088xxx  in patients aged 23–80 years.
all patients had a diagnosis of gout or hyperuricemia and
were randomized to receive  xxxd2088xxx  or placebo daily for
one month. patients underwent a 2 week washout period
and received colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily for 4 weeks
(during the washout period and the first 2 weeks of the
double-blind phase). a total of 259 patients
were screened and 153 were enrolled into the
study. adverse events were recorded throughtable 1.  xxxd2088xxx  and allopurinol pharmacokinetics7,9-12

fact ( xxxd2088xxx  vs allopurinol controlled trial) was
a phase iii, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial designed to compare the safety and efficacy of  xxxd2088xxx 
with that of allopurinol over a 52 week period.28 patients
were included if they had a diagnosis of gout or hyperuricemia (defined as serum  xxxd3472xxx  level ≥8.0 mg/dl or
higher). exclusion criteria included patients with a clcr less
than 50 ml/min, as patients with moderate-to-severe renal
insufficiency would be at risk for allopurinol-related toxicity and the integrity of randomization and blinding of study
drug would be compromised with their inclusion. a total

of 762 of 1283 patients screened were randomized to receive  xxxd2088xxx  or allopurinol once daily. the mean
serum  xxxd3472xxx  level was 9.8 mg/dl, and more than 40%
of subjects had a serum  xxxd3472xxx  level greater than 10
mg/dl at baseline. patients received prophylactic therapy
during the first 8 weeks of the study. the number of patients
requiring treatment for acute gout attacks during weeks 9–52
was recorded. investigators questioned subjects about treatment-related adverse events at the study visits and for 30
days after the study drug was discontinued.
of the 762 patients enrolled in the study, 64 were lost to
follow-up, 47 withdrew secondary to adverse events (abnormal liver function test results, n = 13; maculopapular
rash, n = 9), and 47 discontinued following gout flares (10,

 xxxd2088xxx  for treatment of hyperuricemia and gout

and 39 subjects discontinued due to personal reasons, protocol violations, or other reasons, respectively. all patients
enrolled in the study were included in the efficacy analysis,
with the exception of 4 patients who had serum  xxxd3472xxx 
levels less than 8 mg/dl at baseline. the  xxxd2088xxx -treated
subjects achieved statistically significant decreases in uric
acid by the second week of the study, with those results
maintained to week 52. upon study conclusion, serum uric
acid levels were less than 6 mg/dl in 81%, 82%, and 39%
of patients taking  xxxd2088xxx  80 mg, 120 mg, and allopurinol, respectively. despite colchicine or naproxen prophylaxis, a clinically significant number of patients experienced gout flares. the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001) in the  xxxd2088xxx  120 mg group compared
with the allopurinol and  xxxd2088xxx  80 mg groups.28
the investigators concluded that  xxxd2088xxx  had an acceptable safety profile and was more effective than allopurinol in lowering serum  xxxd3472xxx  concentrations. they
identified the unvarying dose of allopurinol as a potential
limitation to the study findings. in clinical practice, the
dose of allopurinol would likely be increased if the patient
did not respond adequately to the 300 mg daily dose.28
this study provides important information about the efficacy of  xxxd2088xxx  in lowering elevated serum  xxxd3472xxx 
levels; however, clinicians should pay particular attention
to the lack of statistically significant differences in the clinical secondary endpoints, specifically acute gout flares, reduction in tophus area, and number of tophi. perhaps the
lack of statistical significance will prove otherwise in trials
of longer duration, but the results leave unanswered the
question of whether the benefits of aggressively lowering
 xxxd3472xxx  levels are worth the associated risks. nearly 70%
of patients in all treatment groups experienced gout flares
once the prophylactic therapy was discontinued. further
studies must be conducted to determine the optimal length
of prophylactic therapy to balance the potent urate-lowering
effects of  xxxd2088xxx  with patient safety and discomfort.
adverse effects
throughout all clinical trials,  xxxd2088xxx  was generally
safe and well tolerated. the most frequently reported adverse reactions were mild and most frequently gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, abdominal
pain, and vomiting. reported adverse events were similar
across all treatment groups in the phase iii fact trial.28
the most frequent adverse events in the  xxxd2088xxx -treated
patients were abnormal results of liver function tests
(4 –5%), diarrhea (3%), headache (1–2%), arthralgias or
joint swelling (<1–2%), or musculoskeletal signs and
symptoms (1–2%). due to the rapid decrease in urate levels, a significant number of patients across all trials experienced acute gout attacks, thereby highlighting the importance of concomitant colchicine or nsaid therapy during
www.theannals.com

the initiation of  xxxd2088xxx  therapy. four deaths occurred in
 xxxd2088xxx -treated patients in the fact trial. the deaths
were attributed to heart and respiratory failure, retroperitoneal bleeding secondary to anticoagulation therapy,
metastatic colon cancer, and cardiac arrest. additional details describing the circumstances surrounding the patient
deaths were not available. the investigators determined
that the deaths were unrelated to the study drug. there
were no serious adverse events in the allopurinol group.
in the phase ii study by becker et al.,29 11 patients with
a history of allopurinol intolerance (defined in this study as
“history of a reaction precluding rechallenge”) were included in the long-term open-label extension of trial. eight
of the 10 patients who completed the trial had experienced
rash or hives with previous allopurinol therapy. adverse
reactions possibly related to  xxxd2088xxx  in the open-label
extension included abnormal results of liver function tests
(n = 2), headache (n = 1), urticaria (n = 1), myalgias (n = 1),
bruising (n = 1), diarrhea (n = 1), and rash (n = 1). serious
adverse reactions leading to withdrawal (n = 4) were determined by the investigators to be unlikely related or not related to the study drug. based on this small study, patients with
a history of allopurinol intolerance were effectively and
safely treated with  xxxd2088xxx  for at least 2 years.
drug interactions
it is hypothesized that  xxxd2088xxx  is a weak inhibitor of
cyp2d6, although this does not appear to be clinically
significant.30 additional studies need to be conducted to
evaluate whether and, if so, to what extent,  xxxd2088xxx  affects compounds metabolized through the cyp2d6 pathway.12  xxxd2088xxx  is highly protein bound. there are no data
available at this time to indicate whether or to what extent
 xxxd2088xxx  displaces other highly protein bound drugs. studies were conducted to evaluate the potential interactions between  xxxd2088xxx  and medications likely to be administered
concurrently in patients with hyperuricemia and gout.
food and antacid consumption do not alter the pharmacodynamics of  xxxd2088xxx .31 patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide, known to increase  xxxd3472xxx  levels, and
 xxxd2088xxx  experienced insignificant increases in  xxxd3472xxx 
levels. the pharmacokinetic parameters of  xxxd2088xxx  were
unaltered; therefore, the authors concluded that a dose adjustment of  xxxd2088xxx  during concomitant administration
with hydrochlorothiazide was not necessary.32 khosravan
et al.31,33,34 evaluated potential interactions between  xxxd2088xxx  and other agents administered during gout attacks: indomethacin, naproxen, and colchicine. concomitant administration of  xxxd2088xxx  with each of these agents resulted in clinically and statistically insignificant changes in the
pharmacokinetic parameters of all drugs. dosage adjustments will not be necessary if  xxxd2088xxx  is administered with
food, antacids, colchicine, naproxen, or indomethacin.27,31,33,34

dosage and administration
in available phase ii and iii clinical trials,  xxxd2088xxx  80
or 120 mg administered orally once daily resulted in a dramatic and rapid reduction in  xxxd3472xxx  that was maintained
for up to 24 months. when  xxxd2088xxx  therapy is initiated,
patients will likely require concurrent therapy with
colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily, for at least the first 3
months, to decrease the incidence of gout flares. concurrent therapy may be warranted for an extended period of
time since 35% and 26% of patients receiving  xxxd2088xxx 
monotherapy at 6 and 12 months, respectively, experienced flares.24 the dose of  xxxd2088xxx  should be increased,
if necessary, to achieve a  xxxd3472xxx  level less than 6 mg/dl.
reducing the  xxxd3472xxx  below this level helps to dissolve
tophi in patients with chronic gout and to reduce the likelihood of recurrence of gout attacks.12,35
geriatric and pediatric considerations
in a study conducted to evaluate  xxxd2088xxx  pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes in patients aged 65–75
years compared with those aged 19– 40 years, no significant
differences were noted in any parameters.36 pharmacokinetic
differences between males and females were noted in the
same study. the maximum concentration and auc were
higher in females, but the changes were not clinically significant. once weight was included as a covariate, the observed
differences were no longer statistically significant (p > 0.05).
the safety and efficacy of  xxxd2088xxx  in patients 18
years of age or younger have not been evaluated. until
clinical studies are completed, the use of  xxxd2088xxx  is discouraged in this population.
therapeutic and economic issues and
controversies
questions remain about the use of  xxxd2088xxx . its effect
on liver function parameters must be clarified to determine
whether patients should undergo routine monitoring or
whether patients receiving other potentially hepatotoxic
medications should avoid use of  xxxd2088xxx . patients with
moderate-to-severe renal insufficiency were not included
in the fact trial; therefore, additional trials must be conducted to confirm the proposed safety and efficacy of
 xxxd2088xxx  in this population. as stated above, patients are
at an increased risk of experiencing gout flares during the
initiation of  xxxd2088xxx . the optimal duration of colchicine
or nsaid prophylaxis must be determined. the clinical
trials limited prophylaxis to no more than 8 weeks, yet

able letter in october 2005. as of june 2006, representatives of the company indicated that it is uncertain whether
and when the fda will grant final approval. assuming the
drug is approved,  xxxd2088xxx  looks promising for use in patients unable to take allopurinol and in patients with renal
insufficiency. allopurinol is available generically and is,
therefore, relatively inexpensive compared with a newly
marketed drug. based on clinical trial evidence, the longstanding safety and efficacy of allopurinol, and cost-conscious prescribing, allopurinol should remain first-line prophylaxis for patients with recurrent gout. until more information is available,  xxxd2088xxx  should be reserved for
patients who cannot take allopurinol secondary to previous
adverse drug reactions resulting in allopurinol discontinuation, drug interactions, or lack of efficacy.
to date, there are no data to suggest the need for added
laboratory monitoring for patients with renal insufficiency.
assuming that larger scale trials confirm the safety and efficacy in this population,  xxxd2088xxx  may become the preferred option in these patients based on increased convenience for both patient and prescriber. additionally, pharmacoeconomic studies should be conducted to determine
whether the more potent urate lowering of  xxxd2088xxx  results in improved clinical, economic, and/or humanistic
outcomes.
summary
patients with gout and hyperuricemia have waited more
than 40 years for an alternative to allopurinol.  xxxd2088xxx 
is a selective  xxxg2431xxx  inhibitor that is more potent
than allopurinol at lowering  xxxd3472xxx  levels. of particular
note, dose adjustments of  xxxd2088xxx  are not required in patients with mild renal insufficiency, mild or moderate hepatic impairment, or advanced age. clinical trials should be
completed to confirm the hypothesis that dose adjustment
is not necessary in patients with moderate or severe renal
insufficiency before  xxxd2088xxx  is used in this patient population. this medication may represent a new treatment option for patients experiencing hypersensitivity or intolerance secondary to allopurinol treatment. clinical trial evidence provides the safety and efficacy data to suggest the
place in therapy of  xxxd2088xxx , once the review of the drug
is completed by the fda.

artralgias y síntomas músculoesqueletales. debido a su potencia, los
pacientes están a un riesgo más alto de experimentar ataques de gota
durante el primer año de la terapia. hasta un 70% de los pacientes en las
pruebas clínicas experimentaron ataques de gota a pesar de tratamiento
profiláctico concurrente con  xxxd1740xxx  o  xxxd2700xxx . la evidencia
adicional de estudios clínicos apoya la eficacia y seguridad de  xxxd2088xxx 
en el tratamiento de hiperuricemia y gota.
conclusiones:  xxxd2088xxx , un inhibidor selectivo novel de la oxidasa de
xantina, es una alternativa prometedora a alopurinol en el tratamiento de
gota e hiperuricemia. la duración óptima de la terapia profiláctica, el
significado clínico de los resultados anormales de las pruebas de función
del hígado durante la terapia, y la seguridad en pacientes con
insuficiencia renal moderada a severa garantizan investigación adicional.

résumé
objectif: analyser le profil pharmacologique, la pharmacocinétique, les
données des essais cliniques, le profil de tolérance, les précautions
d’emploi du  xxxd2088xxx , un inhibiteur de la xanthine oxydase, non
purique, en développement pour le traitement de l’hyperuricémie et de
la goutte, ainsi que sa place dans ce traitement.
revue de littérature: des études cliniques disponibles et des résumés
furent identifiés à l’aide de la base de données medline
(1990–novembre 2006), du science citation index, de résumés de
spécialité pharmaceutique internationale, des bases de donnes cochrane,
et des sites web de l’american college of rheumatology et de la ligue
europe contre le rhumatisme. les termes-clés de recherche furent :
 xxxd2088xxx ,  xxxd2088xxx , tel-6720, hyperuricémie et goutte.

sélection de l’étude et sélection de l’information: toutes les études
cliniques disponibles décrivant la pharmacologie du  xxxd2088xxx  furent
incluses. les études cliniques publiées chez l’homme furent la base de
discussion pour les paramètres cliniques tels que la pharmacocinétique,
la pharmacodynamique, l’efficacité et la tolérance du  xxxd2088xxx .
résumé : le  xxxd2088xxx  diminue de manière significative les taux d’acide
urique dans les 2 semaines à partir du début du traitement, jusqu'à 48%
vers la fin du traitement de 104 semaines. environ 60% des patients ont
atteint le but primaire du sérum de l’acide urique d’une valeur minimale
de 6 mg/dl pendant les 3 derniers mois suivant une administration de
 xxxd2088xxx  80 ou 120 mg une fois par jour pendant au moins une durée
de 52 semaines. les effets secondaires les plus communs furent des
épreuves fonctionnelles hépatiques anormales, des diarrhées, des
arthralgies, et des symptômes musculosquelettiques. en raison de son
activité pondérale, les patients sont à risque de manifester des érythèmes
dus à la goutte pendant au moins la 1ère année du traitement. lors de
ces essais, près de 70% des patients ont manifesté des érythèmes dus à la
goutte, ceci en dépit d’un traitement concomitant prophylactique par la
colchicine ou le naproxen. d’additionnels arguments cliniques étayent
l’efficacité, la tolérance du  xxxd2088xxx  dans le traitement de
l’hyperuricémie et la goutte.
conclusions: le  xxxd2088xxx , un nouvel inhibiteur sélectif de la xanthine
oxydase est une alternative prometteuse à l’allopurinol pour le
traitement de la goutte et de l’hyperuricémie. la durée optimale du
traitement prophylactique, la signification clinique des résultats des
épreuves fonctionnelles hépatiques pendant le traitement et la tolérance
chez les patients avec une insuffisance rénale modérée ou sévère
justifient de plus amples travaux de recherches.
