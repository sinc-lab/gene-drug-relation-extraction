phosphorylates pl to form plp in the presence of atp
and a divalent cation (zn2+) in liver, plp is then released
to the bloodstream in association with albumin via
schiff-base linkage (8). k+ was reported to have a stimulatory effect on pk in bovine brain (5), human erythrocytes (9), and porcine brain (10). circulating plp is
dephosphorylated by membrane-associated phosphatases before gaining entry to target cells (11, 12) and
being converted back to the active cofactor by intracellular pk after passing through the cell membrane.
a low plp level is maintained in the cell by hydrolysis,
and yet a vast number of enzymes depend on plp for
their enzymatic activities. therefore, how plp is transported to the plp-dependent enzymes without depletion,
and how a single enzyme can react with such a large
number of diverse enzymes, are matters of interest. a
previous study had shown that pk interacts with aspartate aminotransferase (ast) (13), indicating compartmentation of plp might occur to prevent its degradation.
the delivery of plp from pk to plp-dependent apoenzyme is a crucial step for ensuring the proper functioning
of a large number of  xxxd3049xxx -dependent enzymes. we
hypothesize that specific interactions between pk and
plp-dependent enzyme is essential for plp transfer. in
this study, interactions of two plp-dependent enzymes,
 xxxg941xxx  (alt) and  xxxg913xxx  (gad), with pk were first studied by fluorescence polarization technique, followed by surface plasmon resonance (spr) biosensor technology. gad is a

pyridoxal-5-phosphate (plp) is the active form of  xxxd3049xxx  [pyridoxal (pl), pyridoxine and pyridoxamine].
plp is frequently described as nature’s most versatile
coenzyme and is required for numerous enzymes (plpdependent enzymes) that catalyze a large array of reactions in the synthesis, catabolism, and interconversion of
amino acids (1, 2). a recent study by denesyuk et al. (3)
showed the importance of the phosphate group binding
cup for the catalytic activities of plp-dependent
enzymes. the cellular content of plp is determined by
the function of  xxxg1720xxx  (pk), pyridoxine-5-phosphate oxidase and phosphatases. the scheme for the
interconversion of b6 vitamers with their 5¢-phospho
forms including the coenzyme plp has been shown by
mccormick et al. (4) to illustrate the central role of both
the kinase and oxidase in  xxxd3049xxx  metabolism.
pk is an important enzyme that has been detected in
many different organisms and in virtually all mammalian tissues including the brain (5). it is a dimer having
identical subunits of 40 kda that consists of two domains
responsible for atp and pl binding (6). the three dimensional structures of sheep brain pk and its complex with
the nucleotide atp were elucidated recently (7). pk

the interactions of two pyridoxal-5-phosphate (plp)–dependent enzymes, alanine
aminotransferase (alt) and  xxxg913xxx  (gad), with  xxxg1720xxx 
(pk) were studied by fluorescence polarization as well as surface plasmon resonance
techniques. the results demonstrated that pk can specifically bind to alt and gad.
moreover, binding profiles of both enzymes to immobilized pk were altered by excess
amount of plp. the equilibrium affinity constants for alt in the absence and presence of plp are 20.4 ´ 104 m–1and 6.7 ´ 104 m–1, and for gad are 37 ´ 104 m–1and 20.8 ´
104 m–1, respectively. it appears that specific interactions occur between pk and plpdependent enzymes, and the binding affinities of pk for plp-dependent enzymes
decrease in the presence of plp. the results support our hypothesis that plp transfer from pk to plp-dependent enzymes requires a specific interaction between pk
and the enzyme.

materials and methods

materials—the biacorex™ instrument, sensor chip
(cm5, research grade), hbs buffer (10 mm hepes, 150
mm nacl, 3.4 mm edta, 0.05% p20, ph 7.4) and
the amine coupling kit containing n-hydroxysuccinimide (nhs), n-ethyl-n¢-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (edc) and ethanolamine hydrochloride were from
pharmacia biosensor (uppsala, sweden). potassium
hydrogen phosphate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate,
 xxxd2988xxx , sodium  xxxd3215xxx  (sds) and
hydrochloric acid were from honeywell specialty chemicals (seelze, germany). porcine heart alt, e. coli gad
and plp were from sigma (st. louis, mo, usa). fluorescein-5-maleimide was from molecular probes (eugene,
usa). acetonitrile and  xxxd2154xxx  were from merck,
(merck, germany).
purification of recombinant porcine pk and gad—
porcine pk was expressed in e. coli, and purified to more
than 95% purity according to the method developed in
our laboratory (10) through ammonium sulfate precipitation (50 % saturation) and q-sepharose ion-exchange.
the purchased gad was purified by passage through a
superdex-200 prep grade hiload 16/60 column on an
äkta explorer purification system (amersham biosciences, uppsala, sweden). purification was carried out
at 4°c. purchased gad was dissolved in the elution
buffer (pb, 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 150 mm  xxxd2988xxx , ph 6.8) and loaded onto
the column. elution was carried out at a flow rate of 1 ml/
min for 1.3 column volumes, and fractions of 1 ml were
collected. protein concentration of eluted sample was
monitored at 280 nm throughout the elution process
using the äkta explorer. more than 70% purity was
achieved after this step as judged by the sds-page.
mass determination of gad and alt—electrospray
ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (q-tof ii,

micromass, altrincham, u.k.) was used to determine the
mass of gad and alt to determine the ratio of the apo
and holo forms of the enzymes used in this study. protein
sample (gad or alt) at a concentration of 10–4 m was
dissolved in 50% acetonitrile mixture acidified with 1%
 xxxd2154xxx  and sprayed through a capillary elevated at a
potential of 2.2 to 3 kv. horse heart myoglobin was used
as the standard for calibration and mass spectrum was
scanned between the range of 600–1,600 m/z.
labeling of pk—pk (20 mm) was allowed to react with
5 mm fluorescein-5-maleimide (fmi) in 50 mm potassium phosphate (ph 6.8). the mole ratio of enzyme : fluorescein was approximately 1:10. the reaction was
allowed to proceed for 4 h at 4°c with stirring. excess of
free reagent was removed by dialysis against the same
buffer at 4°c. the degree of labeling of pk was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 83,000 m–1 cm–1 at 495 nm. the incorporation of
1.1 mol of dye/monomer does not affect the catalytic function of pk.
fluorescence polarization study on the interaction between pk and plp-dependent enzymes—labeled pk (1
mm) interacted with plp-dependent enzymes alt and
gad at various concentrations (0–20 mm) in pb. the
mixture was allowed to stand for 5 min at 25°c after the
addition of alt or gad in order to reach equilibrium.
fluorescence polarization intensity was measured by
means of fluorescence spectroscopy using an excitation
wavelength of 499 nm and an emission wavelength of 520
nm with a bandwidth of 5 nm. the fluorescence polarization intensity of labeled pk was used as the blank. lysozyme interaction with labeled pk was included as a negative control.
the fraction (a) of fmi-pk bound to alt or gad is a
function of po (fluorescence polarization intensity of fmipk alone), p (fluorescence polarization intensity of fmipk-alt/gad) and pm (maximum fluorescence polarization intensity). the following equations were used to analyze the interaction where the stoichiometry of the complex was assumed to be 1:1.

a = (p – po)/(pm – po)

(1)

the apparent equilibrium constant (dissociation constant) of the complex was determined by plotting 1/a
against 1/[a] using eq. 2.
1/a = 1 + k/[a]

(2)

where [a] is the concentration of the plp-dependent
enzyme and k is the apparent equilibrium constant. the
values of dissociation constants for the binding interaction were obtained from duplicate experiments for each
concentration of alt/gad.
immobilization of pk on cm5 sensor chip—the basic
principle of the spr biosensor (biacore x) and some of
its applications have been described in detail in the
biatechnology handbook (20) and elsewhere (18, 19, 21,
22). cm5 sensor chips are pre-coated with carboxymethyl
dextran, which can concentrate the ligand (pk) close to
the surface of the chip for coupling. the effect of electrostatic interaction was studied by injecting the ligand in

hexamer having a molecular mass of 310 kda (14) and
subunits of 50 kda, each of which binds to one molecule
of plp (15). it catalyzes a-decarboxylation of l-glutamic
acid to form g- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba), a major neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system
(16). alt is a homodimer having a molecular mass of 100
kda and subunits of 50 kda, each of which binds to one
molecule of plp. it catalyzes transamination between
alanine and 2-oxoglutarate to form pyruvate and glutamate, which participates in nitrogen metabolism and
liver gluconeogenesis (17). fluorescence polarization
study used fluorescent-labeled pk to monitor its interaction with alt or gad in solution in the equilibrium
state, whereas the spr biosensor could monitor biomolecular interaction in real time and determine binding
kinetics and affinities without using radioactive or fluorescent-labeled ligands (18, 19). the effects of plp on
binding interaction of pk with alt and gad were also
investigated with the spr biosensor. the spr results
provide kinetic parameters related to the binding mechanism of the enzymes. this information is invaluable for
understanding the regulatory pathway of plp transfer.
the binding of these two plp-dependent enzymes with
pk could also serve as models for studying the interaction of pk with other plp-dependent enzymes.

and kd/ka respectively.
both the association and dissociation phases were fitted simultaneously. data were fitted globally (fitting all
concentrations simultaneously) and locally (fitting each
concentration separately) to find the optimal fit for each
binding interaction. simultaneous local fit is optimal for
the binding interaction. the mean values of the association and dissociation rate constants and equilibrium
affinity constant of the binding interaction were obtained
from duplicate experiments for each concentration of
alt/gad with or without the presence of plp.
heterogeneous analyte and two-state binding models
were also used to analyze the binding interaction. however, the use of these models did not improve the fitting
for the binding interaction. the residual plots for the heterogeneous analyte model are included in the diagram for
comparison. in simultaneous analysis, both association
and dissociation were analyzed simultaneously, and association rate calculation depends on the dissociation rate.
as the dissociation rate is very low, to eliminate the possibility of inaccurate calculation of association rate,
biaevaluation™ software version 2.2 (28) was used to
separately fit the association phase and compare the
results with those obtained in version 3.0 model. the
association model used was a + b = ab type 3. this
model calculates ks = kacn + kd and initial binding rate r0
by fitting data to the following equation:
r = (r0/ks)[1 – e–ks(t–t0)]

where n is the steric interference factor (default 1). by
plotting ks, the observed rate constant, against c, the
sample concentration, ka and kd could be obtained.
results and discussion

the cellular plp level has been found to be very low,
which is probably due to the high catalytic activity of
both free and membrane bound phosphatases (13). this
is consistent with the fact that the kcat values of this large
family of enzymes are at least 30-fold higher than that
pertaining to  xxxg1720xxx . it has been postulated
that the hydrolysis of phosphorylated  xxxd3049xxx  ensures
that a low concentration of around 1 mm plp is present
in eukaryotic cells (29). nevertheless, despite the existence of the active phosphatase, a considerable amount of
plp generated by the kinase is still available for binding
to  xxxd3049xxx -dependent enzymes. the underlying mechanism for the transfer of plp to specific vitamin b6dependent apoenzymes in the presence of phosphatase is
of interest.
previous study by fluorescence spectroscopy showed
that ast interacts with pk (13), and it is suggested that
plp transfer is achieved by compartmentalization. however, whether this interaction is specific to ast or general to all plp-dependent enzymes is unknown. in the
present study, fluorescence polarization study and sprbased protein-protein interaction assay were developed
for evaluation of the binding interaction between pk and

coupling buffers at different phs. the most suitable ph
for coupling was determined to be ph 4.0.
immobilization of pk was carried out by the standard
amine coupling method as previously described (10, 23–
25). the immobilization procedures were carried out at
25°c at a constant flow rate of 5 ml/min. the carboxymethyl dextran surface in channel one was first activated by
injecting 35 ml of 0.1 m edc/0.1 m nhs premixed in 1:1
ratio prior to coupling. then 35 ml of pk (10 mg/ml in 10
mm acetate coupling buffer, ph 4.0) was then injected
over the activated surface for coupling, followed by the
injection of 35 ml of 1 m ethanolamine to deactivate the
remaining active carboxyl groups on the sensor chip surface. hcl (12 ml, 100 mm) was used to remove the
remaining non-covalently bound pk. similar activation
and deactivation procedures were carried out for the control channel, except for the coupling procedure, where ph
4.0 coupling buffer was used in place of pk in order to
block the remaining binding sites on the sensor chip surface and prevent non-specific binding. the control channel is used to correct non-specific binding and bulk
refractive index change interference. the sensor chip was
equilibrated at 5 ml/min with pb for 24 h before carrying
out binding assays.
spr binding interaction for pk and plp-dependent
enzymes—all binding experiments were carried out at
25°c with a constant flow rate of 8 ml/min using pb. alt
or gad in pb ranging from 5 mm to 20 mm was injected
over the sensor surface immobilized with pk for 3 min
(association phase), followed by a 5-min wash with pb
(dissociation phase). the sensor surface was then regenerated with either 100 mm hcl or 0.01 to 0.5% sds. the
interaction of plp-dependent enzymes with pk was also
studied in the presence of excess plp (2 mm).
kinetic models and data analysis—the sensorgrams
were analyzed with biaevaluation™ software version 3.0
(26). several binding models were used to fit the pk-alt
or pk-gad interaction data, including a simple one-toone binding model (langmuir), a heterogeneous analyte
model (competing reactions) and a two state (conformational change) binding model with or without mass transport limit (27). the degree of randomness of the residual
plot and the reduced c2 value were used to assess the
appropriateness of a model to the sensor data. the simplest and the most appropriate model for each binding
interaction was used to derive the kinetic parameters. it
was found that the simple one-to-one binding model
(langmuir) provides sufficient fitting for the pk-alt
and pk-gad interactions. this agrees with the fluorescence polarization study. the reaction equation for the
model is described below, and its rate equation is used to
fit the sensorgram data to derive binding kinetic constants.

fig. 2. interaction of fmi-pk with plp-dependent enzymes.
interactions of fmi-pk with various concentrations of plp-dependent enzymes (0–20 mm) were monitored through fluorescence polarization intensity changes. the fluorescence polarization intensity
was measured at an excitation wavelength of 499 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm with a bandwidth of 5 nm in pb containing a fixed concentration of fmi-pk (1 mm) at 25 °c. fluorescence
polarization intensity of fmi-pk was set as the blank, and the lysozyme interaction with fmi-pk was included as a negative control.
each point indicates the mean of duplicate measurement.

fluorescence polarization study—the purified enzymes
were used in the fluorescence polarization study to determine if pk interacts with alt or gad. the fluorescence
polarization intensity of fmi-pk increases with the
increase in concentration of the plp-dependent enzymes
(fig. 2). both of these enzymes interact with pk, indicating that there is a general interaction between pk and
plp-dependent enzymes. the difference in molecular
weight between gad and alt may be one of the reasons
for the difference in fluorescence polarization intensity
change. lysozyme, a non-plp-dependent protein that
does not interact with pk was included as a negative control in the binding assay. by plotting 1/a against 1/[a],
the apparent equilibrium constants (dissociation constant) obtained for pk-alt and pk–gad are 5.6 ´ 10–6
m and 2.3 ´ 10–6 m, respectively.
spr biosensor study—fluorescence polarization study
showed that there is a general interaction between pk
and plp-dependent enzymes. however, this method only
studied binding interactions between enzymes at equilibrium. to monitor real-time binding interaction between
purified pk and plp-dependent enzymes, spr biosensor
study was performed. pk was immobilized onto the cm5
sensor chip using acetate coupling buffer at ph 4.0.
approximately 3.5 ng/mm2 pk was immobilized based on
the estimation that 1,000 ru corresponds to 1 ng/mm2 of
surface mass (30). a control surface was also prepared to
correct for non-specific binding and bulk refractive index.
signals for specific binding interactions between immobilized pk and plp-dependent enzymes (alt and gad)
were generated by subtracting the non-specific signals
from the control surface. this is the first time that quantitative kinetic profiles were obtained for the interactions
between pk and plp-dependent enzymes.
the binding interactions between immobilized pk and
alt or gad were monitored in real time. solutions of 5
mm alt or gad in the presence or absence of plp were

two plp-dependent enzymes to determine whether the
interaction is general or specific.
purification of pk and gad—changes in fluorescence
polarization intensity upon interaction of fmi-pk with
alt or gad reflect changes in molecular volume and
provide direct measurements of equilibrium binding. the
spr biosensor measures the mass changes as the analyte
passes through the sensor chip surface. both fluorescence
polarization and spr binding interactions would be
affected by purity of the samples, because non-specific
interaction increases with increasing impurity. to minimize non-specific interaction, samples of highest available purity should be used. the purity of the interacting
proteins (pk, alt, and gad) is shown in figure 1. pk
was purified to homogeneity according to the method
described. both alt and gad were obtained commercially. the alt was of acceptable purity (80%) for the
analysis, and the gad was too crude for the assay, and its
purity was improved to 80% by a one-step purification
using superdex-200 prep grade column as indicated in
lane 3 and lane 4 in fig. 1.

binding interactions of alt and gad with the immobilized

chip surface immobilized with pk in the presence and absence of

8 ml/min and with an association phase of 3 min and dissociation
phase of 5 min. bar chart shows percentage response change for the
binding interaction of alt, and gad with pk in the absence and

was set as the reference with a percentage response difference of
100%. lysozyme was included as the negative control.

injected onto the sensor surface. specific binding of alt
and gad to immobilized pk is clearly shown in fig. 3.
the result suggests that binding of plp-dependent
enzymes to pk is a general event, and this finding agrees
with that of the fluorescence polarization study. it
appears that the higher molecular weight of gad (as
compared to alt) contributes to the higher observable
binding of gad to immobilized pk (fig. 3). in addition,
both enzymes could bind to pk in the presence of excess
plp, which affected their binding interactions (fig. 3).

(5–20 mm) were allowed to interact with immobilized pk in the

were carried out at a flow rate of 8 ml min and with an association
phase of 3 min and the dissociation phase of 5 min. the residual

panel. non-linear regression analysis of the association and the dissociation curves was performed using a simple one-to-one binding
model. solid lines are theoretical curves based on the one-to-one

we then determined the binding kinetics of alt and
gad for pk by monitoring the binding interactions of different concentrations of the two enzymes to immobilized
pk. samples ranging from 5 mm to 20 mm were injected
either in the presence or absence of excess plp (2 mm).
the interactions of pk-alt and pk-gad in the absence
(a) or presence (b) of plp are shown in figs. 4 and 5,
respectively. both plp-dependent enzymes bind to pk in
the presence or absence of plp. the interaction between
pk with alt and gad increased with an increase in alt
and gad concentrations. when plp was added, the
binding profiles of alt and gad with pk were affected.
excess plp was used to ensure all the enzymes are covalently linked to their cofactor, as the majority of the
enzymes are in their apo form (31). in the presence of

and sprayed through capillary at a voltage range from 2.2 to 3 kv.
horse heart myoglobin was used as the standard for calibration,
and the mass was scanned between 600 and 1,600 m/z.

association rate constant calculated using simultaneous
ka/kd models depends on the dissociation rate constant.
to prevent inaccuracy that might rise due to the low dissociation rate constant, the kinetic parameters were also
determined by separate ka/kd evaluation model using
biaevaluation software 2.2. the results are similar to
that derived from the simultaneous evaluation models.
thus the simultaneous one-to-one binding model was
used to evaluate the kinetic parameters. the respective
residual plot and minimum c2 were included to indicate
the goodness of fitting for each pair of interactions (figs.
4 and 5). the respective residual plot using the heterogeneous analyte model was also included in the figures (4
and 5) for comparison of fittings between different models.
the fitted kinetic values for pk-alt and pk-gad
interactions with and without plp are summarized in
table 1. for both pk-alt and pk-gad interactions, the
equilibrium affinity constants (ka) were decreased in the
presence of plp (table 1). the measured ka values are of
similar magnitude (104–105 m–1) to those for the interaction between pk and its substrates (pl, pyridoxamine,
and pyridoxine) as measured previously by our group
(10). spr results were consistent with the results
obtained in fluorescence polarization study.

after plp transfer, the holo-enzyme alt-plp or gad-plp dissociates from pk, and pk is ready for another cycle of plp transfer. in
the absence of plp, alt or gad can still bind to pk, but the association and dissociation rate constants are smaller than those in the
presence of plp.

plp, the slopes of the association and dissociation phases
for both enzymes with pk were steeper than that in the
absence of plp. yet another study by kawasaki (32) had
indicated that  xxxg618xxx  was 90% saturated
instead of 10–20% saturated with plp. thus electrospray
ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (esi-q-tofms) was used to determine the mass of gad and alt to
see whether the majority of the enzyme is in apo or holo
form. as plp is covalently bound to the enzyme, the condition used for esi-tof-ms would not lead to its detachment from the enzyme. if the enzyme is in holo form, it
would have a mass that is 247.1 da greater than the apo
form. figure 6 is the mass spectrum for gad, which indicates that gad is entirely in the apo form. the result is
the same for alt (data not shown). though our result
showed that excess plp affects the binding profile of pk
with plp-dependent enzyme, we could not exclude the
possibility that the binding of plp to the surface of gad
or alt might alter the conformation or charges of the
surface. the latter may affect the process of binding to
pk, as plp is known to form a schiff base non-specifically with the epsilon amino group of lysine residues of
proteins.
kinetic parameters of the binding interactions were
derived from the sensorgram by non-linear curve fitting
with various kinetic models using biaevaluation software 3.0. base on our fluorescence polarization study, the
stoichiometry of the complex between pk and plpdependent enzymes is 1:1. our biosensor study also indicated that the simple one-to-one binding model is adequate to fit data for both pk-alt and pk-gad interactions. use of the heterogeneous analyte and two-state
models did not improve the result of curve fitting. the

 xxxg1720xxx  and plp-dependent enzymes interaction

this work was initiated by late prof. j.e. churchich and we
would like to dedicate this manuscript to him in memory of
his invaluable comments on this study. this project was supported by the areas of excellence scheme established under
the university grants committee of the hong kong special
administrative region, china [aoe/p-10/01], and by the area
of strategic development grant from the hong kong polytechnic university a008.

studies showed that both plp-dependent enzymes bind
to pk in the presence or absence of plp. these results
support our hypothesis that plp transfer requires the
direct interactions of pk with plp-dependent enzymes
upon its biosynthesis by pk to prevent plp depletion in
the cell by phosphatase. the association constants for the
interaction of pk with the two plp-dependent enzymes
are of similar magnitude, suggesting that both enzymes
have similar affinity towards pk (table 1). the affinities
of the two enzymes for pk were both decreased in the
presence of excess plp, due to the dramatic increase in
dissociation rate of the interactions (table 1). the results
suggest that plp facilitates the dissociation of plpdependent enzymes from pk, which may in turn facilitate the access of other plp-dependent enzymes that are
in need of plp. the slight difference between the kd
measured by the two methods might be due to the difference between the methods used i.e., fluorescence polarization study involves the attachment of a fluorescence
probe to pk and is carried out in aqueous phase, while
the spr biosensor involves the immobilization of pk and
is carried out on solid-liquid interface. in any case, the
binding interactions will be affected to different extents.
previous study reported that ast, another plpdependent enzyme, interacts specifically with pk (13).
together with the results obtained in the present study,
the interaction of plp-dependent proteins with pk is
likely to be a process for plp transfer. fig. 7 is a proposed
model that summarizes the major events for the coupling
of plp production by pk to its delivery to plp-dependent
enzymes. pl is converted by pk to plp, which then interacts with plp-dependent enzymes for direct transfer of
plp. in the presence of plp, the dissociation of plpdependent enzymes from pk is enhanced, allowing the
release of these enzymes from pk. in the absence of plp,
the plp-dependent enzymes could still bind to pk, but
with smaller association and dissociation rate constants.
although our data demonstrate the direct interactions
between pk and plp-dependent enzymes, it remains to
be determined if the domain for pk-plp-dependent
enzymes interactions is superimposed with the catalytic
domain of pk. this information will further support our
hypothesis that the direct contact between pk and plpdependent enzymes allows plp transfer, and provides a
mechanism for how more than 100 different plp-dependent enzymes can obtain sufficient plp in despite the
extremely low concentration of free plp in the cell. our
model provides a possible mechanism for plp transfer to
prevent the access of existing phosphatases to the newly
synthesized plp.
