a bs t r ac t
background

we tested the safety and efficacy of eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody
against terminal complement protein c5 that inhibits terminal complement activation, in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (pnh).
methods

we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 3
trial. patients received either placebo or eculizumab intravenously; eculizumab was
given at a dose of 600 mg weekly for 4 weeks, followed 1 week later by a 900-mg
dose and then 900 mg every other week through week 26. the two primary end
points were the stabilization of hemoglobin levels and the number of units of
packed  xxxd187xxx  transfused. biochemical indicators of intravascular hemolysis and
the patients’ quality of life were also assessed.
results

eighty-seven patients underwent randomization. stabilization of hemoglobin levels
in the absence of transfusions was achieved in 49% (21 of 43) of the patients assigned to eculizumab and none (0 of 44) of those assigned to placebo (p<0.001).
during the study, a median of 0 units of packed  xxxd187xxx  was administered in the
eculizumab group, as compared with 10 units in the placebo group (p<0.001). eculizumab reduced intravascular hemolysis, as shown by the 85.8% lower median area
under the curve for lactate dehydrogenase plotted against time (in days) in the eculizumab group, as compared with the placebo group (58,587 vs. 411,822 u per liter;
p<0.001). clinically significant improvements were also found in the quality of life,
as measured by scores on the functional assessment of chronic illness therapyfatigue instrument (p<0.001) and the european organization for research and
treatment of cancer quality of life questionnaire. of the 87 patients, 4 in the eculizumab group and 9 in the placebo group had serious adverse events, none of which
were considered to be treatment-related; all these patients recovered without sequelae.

aroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (pnh), an uncommon form of hemolytic anemia, results from the clonal expansion of hematopoietic stem cells that have somatic
mutations in the x-linked gene pig-a.1,2 pig-a mutations cause an early block in the synthesis of
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi) anchors, which
tether many proteins to the cell surface. consequently, the blood cells in patients with pnh have
a partial deficiency (type ii) or a complete deficiency (type iii) of gpi-linked proteins.
intravascular hemolysis is a prominent feature
of pnh and is the consequence of the absence of
the gpi-linked complement regulatory protein
cd59.3,4 cd59 blocks the formation of the terminal complement complex (also called the membrane-attack complex) on the cell surface, thereby
preventing erythrocyte lysis and in vitro platelet
activation.5-8 excessive or persistent intravascular
hemolysis in patients with pnh causes anemia,
hemoglobinuria, and complications related to the
presence of plasma free hemoglobin, including
thrombosis, abdominal pain, dysphagia, erectile
dysfunction, and pulmonary hypertension.9-12 indeed, the symptoms in pnh are often disproportionate to the degree of anemia. many patients
with this disease are dependent on transfusions.
currently, there is no therapy that effectively reduces intravascular hemolysis or improves the
symptoms in patients with pnh.
eculizumab ( xxxd1963xxx , alexion pharmaceuticals)
is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed
against the terminal complement protein c5.13 in
a preliminary, 12-week, open-label clinical study
involving 11 patients with pnh, eculizumab reduced intravascular hemolysis and the patients’
transfusion requirements.14 however, this twocenter, uncontrolled study did not have a control
group or predefined criteria for the administration of a transfusion, such as a predefined hemoglobin level at which transfusions were administered or a prespecified number of units of packed
 xxxd187xxx  for a given hemoglobin level.
we report the results of the phase 3 transfusion reduction efficacy and safety clinical investigation, a randomized, multicenter, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, using eculizumab in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (triumph)
study, which investigated whether eculizumab
stabilized hemoglobin levels and reduced transfusion requirements in 87 transfusion-dependent
patients with pnh during 6 months of treatment.

patients

the trial consisted of a 2-week screening period,
an observation period of up to 3 months, and a
26-week treatment period. patients 18 years of age
or older who had received at least four transfusions during the previous 12 months were eligible. a pnh type iii erythrocyte proportion of 10%
or more, platelet counts of at least 100,000 per
cubic millimeter, and lactate dehydrogenase levels
that were at least 1.5 times the upper limit of the
normal range were also required. concomitant
administration of erythropoietin, immunosuppressive drugs, corticosteroids, coumarins, lowmolecular-weight heparins, iron supplements, and
 xxxd2146xxx  were permitted, provided that the doses
were constant before and throughout the study.
because persons who have a genetic deficiency of
terminal complement proteins have an increased
risk of neisserial infections, all patients were vaccinated against neisseria meningitidis with the use
of locally approved vaccines. the protocol was
approved by the institutional review board at
each center, and all patients gave written informed
consent.
patients receiving transfusions who had a
mean hemoglobin level greater than 10.5 g per
deciliter before transfusion during the 12 months
before entry into the study or who had received
another investigational drug within 30 days before the first visit were excluded. patients who
had a complement deficiency, an active bacterial
infection, or a history of meningococcal disease
and those who had undergone bone marrow
transplantation were also excluded.
an individualized transfusion algorithm was
calculated for each patient on the basis of the
history of transfusions during the previous 12
months; the written algorithm documented the
number of units of packed  xxxd187xxx  to be transfused for given hemoglobin values and served as
a prospectively determined guide for transfusion
during the observation and treatment periods.
before randomization, eligible patients were observed for up to 13 weeks. patients who did not
require a transfusion during the observation period were considered ineligible. a transfusion administered to a patient who had a hemoglobin

clinical efficacy

statistical analysis

the two primary end points were the stabilization of hemoglobin levels, defined as a hemoglobin value that was maintained above the level at
which the qualifying transfusion was administered, in the absence of transfusions during the
26-week treatment period, and the number of
units of packed  xxxd187xxx  transfused during that
period. the trigger for the administration of transfusions during the study remained unchanged:
patients received transfusions when they had symptoms resulting from anemia and their hemoglobin levels reached the individualized, predetermined set point. prespecified secondary end points
included transfusion independence; hemolysis, as
measured by the lactate dehydrogenase value for
the area under the curve from baseline to 26 weeks;
and changes in the level of fatigue, as assessed
from baseline to 26 weeks with the use of the
functional assessment of chronic illness therapyfatigue (facit-fatigue) instrument (scores can
range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating
improvement in fatigue).15 prespecified exploratory analyses included assessment of the quality
of life with the use of the european organization
for research and treatment of cancer quality of
life questionnaire (eortc qlq-c30) (scores can
range from 0 to 100, with higher scores on the

the planned sample size of 75 patients provided
the study with a statistical power of 82%, at an
alpha level of 0.05, to detect an increase of 35 percentage points (i.e., a change from 20% to 55%)
in the rate of the stabilization of hemoglobin levels and a reduction in the median number of units
of packed  xxxd187xxx  transfused from 6 to 2 (±2).
for the two primary end points, the analyses
were performed according to the intention-totreat principle with the use of data on all 87 patients who underwent randomization; stabilization of hemoglobin levels was analyzed with the
use of fisher’s exact test, and the total number of
units of packed  xxxd187xxx  transfused was analyzed
with the use of the wilcoxon rank-sum test. to
assess the effect of treatment on whether or not
transfusions were required, fisher’s exact test
was used. the log-rank test was used to compare
the time to the first transfusion in the two groups.
the area under the curve for lactate dehydrogenase was compared between the two groups with

patients’ characteristics

of a total of 115 patients with pnh who underwent screening, 87 (35 men and 52 women) at 34
sites in the united states, canada, europe, and
australia who received a qualifying transfusion,
met the inclusion criteria and did not meet any of
the exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to
eculizumab (43 patients) or placebo (44 patients)
between october 2004 and june 2005. at each of
16 sites one patient underwent randomization, at
each of 6 sites two patients underwent randomization, and at each of 12 sites 3 or more patients
underwent randomization. there were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics of
the patients in the two groups (table 1).
of 87 patients who underwent randomization,
85 completed the trial (see the supplementary
appendix, available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org). two patients in the eculizumab group did not complete the trial, one
because traveling to the study center was inconvenient and the other because of pregnancy; these
patients were included in the analyses. ten patients in the placebo group discontinued infusions because of a perceived lack of efficacy but
remained in the study for monitoring, as prespecified in the protocol, and were included in
the analyses.
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

in 42 of 43 patients in the eculizumab group, a
900-mg dose of eculizumab every 2 weeks (±2
days) completely blocked serum hemolytic activity, as assessed by a presensitized erythrocyte
hemolytic assay,14 throughout the study period.
in one patient, therapeutic trough levels of eculizumab were not maintained.

weeks (p<0.001). the median value of the areas
under the curve for lactate dehydrogenase plotted against time (in days) was 85.8% lower in the
eculizumab group than in the placebo group
(58,587 vs. 411,822 u per liter; p<0.001). a second biochemical measure of hemolysis, the serum
level of aspartate aminotransferase, also showed
significant improvement with eculizumab, as compared with placebo (data not shown).
the reduction in intravascular hemolysis in the
eculizumab group resulted in an increase in pnh
type iii erythrocytes (fig. 1b) from a mean of
28.1±2.0% at baseline to 56.9±3.6% at week 26.
the proportion of pnh type iii erythrocytes in
patients in the placebo group remained constant
(35.7±2.8% before treatment and 35.5±2.8% at
26 weeks, p<0.001 for the comparison with the
eculizumab group and the placebo group). the
proportion of pnh type iii granulocytes and
monocytes did not change significantly between
the two groups (data not shown).
clinical efficacy

primary end points

the two primary efficacy end points were the
stabilization of hemoglobin levels and the number of units of packed  xxxd187xxx  transfused. at the
end of the treatment period, 49% of patients in
the eculizumab group (21 of 43) had levels of hemoglobin that remained above the prespecified
set point (median, 7.7 g per deciliter for both
groups) in the absence of transfusions, whereas

of

m e dic i n e

stabilization of hemoglobin levels did not occur in
any patient in the placebo group (p<0.001) (table
2). by week 26, the median number of units of
packed  xxxd187xxx  transfused per patient was 0 in
the eculizumab group and 10 in the placebo
group (p<0.001), whereas the mean number of
units of packed  xxxd187xxx  transfused was 3.0±0.7
and 11.0±0.8, respectively. in the 6-month period
before the study, the median number of units of
packed  xxxd187xxx  transfused per patient was 9.0 in
the eculizumab cohort and 8.5 in the placebo
cohort, and the mean number of units of packed
 xxxd187xxx  transfused was 9.6±0.6 and 9.7±0.7, respectively. the mean hemoglobin levels changed
from 10.0±0.2 g per deciliter and 9.7±0.2 g per
deciliter in the eculizumab group and the placebo
group, respectively, at baseline to 10.1±0.2 g per
deciliter and 8.9±0.2 g per deciliter, respectively,
at week 26 (p<0.001, by mixed-model analysis).
the median time to the first transfusion was
significantly longer in eculizumab-treated patients
than in patients who received placebo (p<0.001)
(fig. 2). transfusion independence was achieved
in 51% of patients in the eculizumab group (22
of 43) and 0% of those in the placebo group
(0 of 44, p<0.001). by week 26, the total number
of units of packed  xxxd187xxx  transfused was 131
in the eculizumab group and 482 in the placebo
group (table 2). by contrast, during the 6 months
before the study, the total number of units transfused was 413 in the eculizumab group and 417
in the placebo group.

quality of life

assessments of the quality of life were performed
with the use of two instruments, the facit-fatigue
instrument and the eortc qlq-c30 instrument.
patients in the eculizumab group had a mean
increase (improvement) in scores on the facitfatigue instrument of 6.4±1.2 points from baseline
to week 26, whereas in the placebo group the mean
score decreased by 4.0±1.7 points during this period, for a total difference between the two groups
of 10.4 points (fig. 3). a mixed-model analysis of
covariance was performed that showed a significant difference between the two groups (p<0.001).
with respect to the eortc qlq-c30 instrument, the eculizumab group had significant
improvements in scores on the scale for global
health status, on all five scales for functioning,
on two of three symptom scales, and on three of

(table 4). no serious adverse events were considered to be treatment-related; all these patients recovered without sequelae. the most common adverse events reported in the eculizumab group were
headache, nasopharyngitis, back pain, and nausea.
headache and back pain occurred more frequently in the eculizumab group than in the placebo
group. the number of headaches that occurred was
similar in the two groups after the first 2 weeks
of therapy. there were no significant differences
in the incidence rates between the two groups for
any reported adverse event. a single thrombosis
occurred in a patient in the placebo group.
one patient in each of the two groups had detectable levels of antibodies against eculizumab.
the levels were low, were detected at a single
visit, and in the patient receiving eculizumab,
the antibodies did not affect complement inhibition.

figure 3. change in fatigue scores from baseline to week 26.
week 0 (baseline) represents the end of the observation period, within 10 days after the patient’s receipt of the
qualifying blood transfusion. fatigue scores are therefore higher (indicating less fatigue) at week 0 than at the initial
screening visits (data not shown). values for the change from baseline (dashed line) represent means. a positive
change from baseline indicates an improvement in fatigue and a negative change from baseline indicates a worsening in fatigue. i bars indicate the standard error.

need for transfusions to sustain hemoglobin levels occur frequently, as does deterioration of the
patient’s quality of life. in this study, in approximately half the patients treated with eculizumab,
the end points of stabilization of hemoglobin levels and transfusion independence were reached,
whereas none of the patients in the placebo group
reached either of these end points. the median
time to the first transfusion was 4 weeks in the
placebo group and more than 6 months in the
eculizumab group. the overall rate of transfusion was reduced by 73% in the eculizumab group.
even among patients receiving eculizumab in
whom transfusion independence was not reached,
the number of units of packed  xxxd187xxx  transfused
was reduced by 44%, as compared with patients
in the placebo group (data not shown).
intravascular hemolysis is central to the occurrence of serious coexisting conditions in
patients with pnh and contributes to the risk of
death among these patients.9,12 lactate dehydrogenase, a biochemical marker of hemolysis, was
immediately reduced from approximately 10 times
the upper limit of the normal range to normal

1240

n engl j med 355;12

levels or to just above normal levels in all patients
in the eculizumab group. residual low-level hemolysis in some patients despite terminal-complement blockade may be caused by an inherent
decrease in the survival of pnh type iii erythrocytes19 or may be due to the fact that these cells
are opsonized with c3b, which mediates extravascular clearance through the reticuloendothelial system.
before treatment with eculizumab, the hemoglobin levels were maintained by transfusion.
therefore, the stabilization of hemoglobin levels
with a concomitant cessation of or reduction in
the number of transfusions indicates an increase
in endogenous erythrocyte mass. the reduction in
hemolysis with eculizumab results in a new
steady-state hemoglobin level, as determined by a
balance of the underlying bone marrow dysfunction, the increased half-life of pnh erythrocytes
because of eculizumab therapy, and the new level
of transfusions (if any) required.
for most patients with pnh, the quality of life
is impaired, and the impairment has been attributed not only to anemia but also to excessive in-

travascular hemolysis and the scavenging of nitric
oxide by cell-free hemoglobin.9-11 in this study,
the reduction in intravascular hemolysis with eculizumab, as compared with placebo, was associated with a significant improvement in fatigue,
as assessed by scores on the facit-fatigue instrument. eculizumab increased the baseline score
for fatigue by 6.4 points. a change of three or
more points in scores on this instrument represents a clinically important difference.20 improvement with eculizumab in the fatigue component
of the eortc qlq-c30 instrument provides additional evidence for the benefit shown by scores
on the facit-fatigue instrument. these improvements with eculizumab occurred without complete resolution of the anemia, providing further
evidence of the contribution of hemolysis, in contrast to anemia, to the diminishing quality of life

there were no deaths during the study, and
only a single thrombotic event occurred in a patient in the placebo group. there were four serious adverse events in the eculizumab group and
nine in the placebo group; all these patients recovered. the issue of possible protection against
the risk of thrombosis through terminal complement inhibition with eculizumab is being evaluated in ongoing clinical studies of pnh. all
