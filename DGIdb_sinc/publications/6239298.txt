abstract. chronic administration
of  xxxd2511xxx  or clozapine in rats for 4 weeks or 10
weeks did not produce enhancement
of striatal dopamine
receptor density.
however, there was a marked reduction (50-60s) of cortical  xxxg1108xxx   xxxg1110xxx   xxxg1113xxx   xxxg1114xxx   xxxg1115xxx   xxxg1117xxx   xxxg1119xxx 
density associated with clozapine or  xxxd2511xxx  administration.
acute doses of
clozapine or  xxxd2511xxx  produced the same potent effect. the possibility that these
two antipsychotic
drugs act via the serotonin system in the brain is proposed.

the blockade of central dopamine receptors has been proposed to be the major action
of antipsychotic
drugs such as haloperidol
or chlorpromazine
(carlsson
and
lindqvist,
1963) in controlling
schizophrenic
symptoms. this observation
led to the
proposal of the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia
by van rossum (1966); the
hypothesis states that schizophrenia
is associated with hyperdopaminergic
neurotransmission
in the brain.
chronic administration
of some antipsychotic
drugs in animals is known to induce
dopamine
receptor supersensitivity
in the central nervous system (fjalland
and
moller-nielsen,
1974; gianutsos et al., 1974; tarsy and baldessarini,
1974; smith and
davis, 1975; yarbrough,
1975; clow et al., 1979). in the human, this induction of
dopaminergic
supersensitivity
by neuroleptics
is thought to be the probable cause of
tardive dyskinesia in chronic schizophrenics
(klawans and rubovits, 1972; tarsy and
baldessarini,
1977). on the other hand, some antipsychotic drugs, like clozapine, seem
less likely to induce tardive dyskinesia (wyatt and delisi, 1984). tardive dyskinesia
may also be caused by an imbalance of the dopaminergic-cholinergic
systems in the
basal ganglia (gerlach et al., 1974; casey and denney, 1977) an imbalance between
indolamines
and catecholamines
(prange et al., 1973) or a y-aminobutyric
acid
(gaba) deficiency (ananth, 1979; singh et al., 1982).

commonly used antipsychotic
drugs that potently block dopamine receptors (such
as the butyrophenones
and phenothiazines)
are more effective in treating the positive
symptoms manifested in chronic schizophrenic
patients (angrist et al., 1980), whereas
the negative symptoms such as flattening
of affect and poverty of speech are less
responsive. central nervous system (cns) dopamine receptor pathology may not be
the cause of certain symptoms seen in schizophrenia,
namely, the negative symptoms.
haase et al. (1974) reported that chronic schizophrenic patients given sulpiride, a weak
dopamine receptor blocker, at doses of about 200 mg/day showed an elation of mood
and clearing of negative signs. using sulpiride as a trial drug in the treatment
of
hospitalized
schizophrenic
patients, elizur and davidson
(1975) also found it is
effective in improving the autistic state of these patients.
we have studied the effects of three antipsychotic
drugs- xxxd2511xxx ,
clozapine, and
sulpiride-on
rat brain neurotransmitter
receptors. these three antipsychotic
drugs
have previously been reported either to show minimal extrapyramidal
and dyskinetic
effects or to have beneficial effects on some of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia
(shopsin et al., 1979; edwards et al., 1980). haloperidol, as a typical neuroleptic drug,
was also included in this study.
methods
chronic drug treatment. adult male wistar rats (150-i 75 g) were used. they were housed in
groups of four with water and food ad lib and were allowed to adapt to the environment
for a
period of 7 days before drug administration
began. animals were divided into two treatment
groups: chronic daily administration
for a duration of either 28 days or 10 weeks. drugs
administered
and the corresponding
doses were:  xxxd2511xxx  (5 mg/ kg), clozapine (30 mg/ kg),
sulpiride (100 mg/kg), haloperidol
(5 mg/ kg), and vehicle (0.1 m tartaric acid, 1 ml per
injection). all drugs were dissolved in vehicle and given intraperitoneally,
1 ml per day.
the acute effect of clozapine and  xxxd2511xxx  was studied by injecting a separate group of rats
with a single dose of the drugs and then sacrificing the animals 24 hours later.
brain tissue preparation. two days after the last injection, animals were sacrificed by
decapitation
(around 9 a.m.) and brains were immediately removed. tissues from the frontal
cortex and corpus striatum were dissected out on ice. these brain regions from each rat were
separately homogenized
with a teflon-glass
homogenizer
(clearance: 0.13-0.18 mm) in 20
volumes of ice cold tean buffer containing
15 mm tris-hci, 5 mm na2edta, 1.1 mm
 xxxd228xxx , and 12.5 pm  xxxd2717xxx  with ph adjusted to 7.4 using 0.1 n hci. the crude
homogenates,
obtained after homogenizing
with 20 up-and-down
strokes, were centrifuged at
39,000g for 15 minutes at 4°c. the supernatant
was then discarded and the pellet was
resuspended in fresh tean buffer. at this step, tissue homogenate from the frontal cortex was
then frozen and stored at -2o’c for radioreceptor
assay at a later date. tissue suspension from
corpus striatum was further centrifuged and resuspended in buffer, and the same process was
repeated one more time (total three times). at the end of the third centrifugation,
the pellet was
resuspended in buffer at a tissue concentration
of about 20 mg wet tissue per ml of buffer. they
were then frozen and stored at -20°c for future radioreceptor
assays.
dopamine (dz) receptor assay. the method is essentially the same as described previously
(lee and tang, 1982). the frozen homogenate
from corpus striatum was thawed and
centrifuged at 39,000g for i5 minutes at 4’c. they were then resuspended in tean buffer such
that the final membrane protein concentration
was about 0.2 mg/ ml. the tissue suspension was
further homogenized
with a brinkmann polytron (pt-io, full scale of io) for 20 seconds at a
setting of 6. then, 0.2 ml aliquots of such membrane suspension were added to test tubes already

279

containing
0.2 ml of 3h-spiperone
(new england nuclear corp., speci$ic activity = 25-30
ci/mmole)
at various concentrations
and 0.2 ml of either buffer or io- m sulpiride. the
ingredients were thoroughly mixed with a vortex and allowed to incubate at room temperature
for 30 minutes. at the end of the incubation period, 0.5 ml of the incubate was rapidly filtered
through whatman gf/ b glass fiber filters and immediately followed by a wash with 10 ml of
buffer. the filters were then transferred to scintillation vials and 9 ml of aquasol was added to
each vial. the radioactivity was measured by a liquid scintillation counter after the filters were
equilibrated in aquasol overnight.

serotonin (sj receptor assay. essentially

the method is the same as described above.
crude homogenate from frontal cortex was thawed and then polytroned for 20 seconds before
use. 3h-spiperone was used to label the receptors and 50 nm  xxxd2637xxx  was used to displace the
radioligand from the binding sites.
the radioreceptor
binding assays were carried out using different concentrations
of
radioligand (0.05-i nm for dopamine receptors and 0.05-3 nm for serotonin receptors), thus
allowing determination
of receptor densities (b,,,) and receptor affinities (kd) by scatchard
analysis. statistical significance was tested using the two-tailed student’s t test.

discussion
antipsychotic
drugs like haloperidol
or chlorpromazine
have been demonstrated
to
increase the dopamine receptors in the rat after chronic treatment (burt et al., 1977;
theodorou
et al., 1981). our present data indicated that  xxxd2511xxx  and clozapine,
however, did not increase dopamine receptor density in the rat brain compared to
haloperidol.
this finding is compatible
with reports by several investigators
that
clozapine did not cause any change in the dopamine system in animals (kobayashi et
al., 1977; tye et al., 1979; rebec et al., 1982; seeger et al., 1982). the finding that
sulpiride caused a 22% increase in dopamine receptor density in the present study is in
agreement with some recent reports (hall et al., 1981; lau et al., 1983) that chronic
sulpiride induced dopaminergic
supersensitivity
in the rat. bannet et al. (1980) and
montanaro
et al. (1982) however, reported that chronic sulpiride treatment in the rat
had no effect on dopamine receptors.
the possibility that residual drug left on the membrane might have affected receptor
binding can be ruled out since the affinity constants
(k,) were not significantly
different among the various drug groups compared to the vehicle-control
group.
clozapine and sulpiride have been used to treat schizophrenic
patients because of
their minimal extrapyramidal
side effects (matz et al., 1974; mielke et al., 1977;
gelenberg and doller, 1979; lapierre et al., 1980; rama rao et al., 1981). since the
chronic administration
of ioxapine and clozapine in this study did not seem to produce
any significant
increase in dopaminergic
receptor numbers,
the probability
of
developing tardive dyskinesia after long-term use may be less likely, although  xxxd2511xxx 
has not been shown to be devoid of extrapyramidal
side effects.
in our present study,  xxxd2511xxx  and clozapine were very effective in altering the
serotonin neuronal system, causing a significant reduction of serotonin (s,) receptor
density. reynolds et al. (1983) also recently reported the down-regulation
of cortical
sz receptors by chronic clozapine treatment, acute clozapine and  xxxd2511xxx  were also
effective in reducing s, receptor number. thus far, the unusual effect on s2 receptors
has only been reported for tricyclic (bergstrom
and kellar, 1979; peroutka
and
snyder,
19806; barbaccia
et al., 1983; friedman
et al., 1983) and some other
antidepressant
drugs (peroutka and snyder, 1980~; fillion and fillion, 1981; wong
and bymaster, 198 1; blackshear and sanders-bush,
1982). even more intriguing is the
potent effect of clozapine and  xxxd2511xxx  in reducing the s, receptor after a single dose.
again, this same action has only been so far reported in some atypical antidepressant
drugs, e.g.,  xxxd2637xxx 
(blackshear and sanders-bush,
1982). the elevation of ‘&
receptor number by haloperidol after 4 weeks of treatment is difficult to interpret but
may signify the interaction
between the serotonin
and dopamine
systems. this
possibility needs to be studied further.
some schizophrenic
patients who do not respond to the classical neuroleptics such
as haloperidol
and chlorpromazine
have been shown to have enlarged cerebral
ventricles (weinberger et al., 1980; andreasen et al., 1982; frangos and athanassenas,
1982; nasrallah et al., 1982). these patients have been diagnosed as primarily having
negative symptoms such as flattening of affect and poverty of speech in the course of
their illness (crow, 1980, 1981; mackay, 1980; andreasen and olsen, 1982). postmortem human brain studies have demonstrated
a subgroup of schizophrenic patients

282
showing normal numbers of dopamine receptors in the brain (lee and seeman, 1980a,
19806, 1982). these brains may have been from patients who had large ventricles and
were also resistant to neuroleptic drug treatment. nasrallah et al. (1980) failed to show
the neuroleptic-potentiating
effect of a-methyl- xxxd3459xxx ,
a dopamine
synthesis
inhibitor, in schizophrenic
patients with large ventricles. potkin et al. (1983) reported
an abnormality
of the serotonin system in schizophrenic
patients with large ventricles.
all these observations
suggest that the etiology of a complex disease such as
schizophrenia
cannot be explained by dopamine abnormality
alone.
wyatt and delisi (1984) pointed
out that clozapine-like
drugs may have
characteristics
that are not shared with the conventional
neuroleptics
such as
haloperidol.
in the present study, we have obtained evidence showing that  xxxd2511xxx 
and clozapine have possible effects on serotonergic neuronal systems that distinguish
them from typical antipsychotic
drugs.
in conclusion,
it is possible that the effect of some antipsychotic
drugs such as
 xxxd2511xxx  and clozapine on the serotonin system may contribute to their therapeutic
action. the absence of dopamine (d2) receptor increase after chronic clozapine or
 xxxd2511xxx  administration
suggests that these drugs may not induce tardive dyskinesia in
patients.
