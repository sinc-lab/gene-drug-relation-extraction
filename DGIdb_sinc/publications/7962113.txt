the plasrninogen activation (pa) system of human c o l 1 5 colon carcinoma cells
was investigated. analysis at the levels of protein and rnrna of cultured cells and
of histozyrnography of tumor xenografts in nude mice showed that c o l 1 5 cells
produce only tissue type pa ( xxxg1766xxx ) and no urokinase ( xxxg1767xxx ). also, rnrna for the
 xxxg1767xxx  receptor and for pa inhibitor type 2 ( xxxg2053xxx ), but not for pai-1, were detected.
we developed a quantitative degradation assay using glutaraldehyde-irnrnobilized '251-laminin to investigate the capacity of c o l 1 5 cells to degrade larninin.
larninin degradation by col15 cells was completely inhibited by 100 pgirnl of
polyclonal anti- xxxg1766xxx  igg, by the plasrnin inhibitors aprotinin (1 00 p,g/ml) or e-arninocaproic acid ( xxxd146xxx ; at 0.3 m), but not by antibodies against  xxxg1767xxx  or  xxxg1768xxx  nor
by nonirnrnune igg. cycloheximide-treated col15 cells were unable to degrade
larninin but increased laminin degradation induced by conditioned medium of
c o l 15 cells or recombinant  xxxg1766xxx . n o potentiation was observed when c o l 15
cells and larninin were kept separated by transwelltminserts. our results suggest
that col15 human colon carcinoma cells degrade larninin by potentiating t-pamediated plasrninogen activation at the cell surface which requires close contact
between tumor cells and larninin substrate.

the multistep process of malignant invasion and metastasis is associated with the degradation of surrounding extracellular matrices (ecm). plasminogen activators (pas) secreted by malignant cells convert
plasminogen into plasmin, a large spectrum trypsinlike  xxxg745xxx , which can degrade several components of the ecm directly or indirectly via activation of
pro-forms of matrix metalloproteinases (mignatti et al.,
1986; reviewed by pollanen et al., 1991; vassalli et al.,
1991). two types of pa,  xxxg1767xxx  and  xxxg1766xxx , have been identified in neoplastic cells. most human tumors produce
 xxxg1767xxx , whereas  xxxg1766xxx  has been detected in melanoma,
neuroblastoma, and leukemic cells (pollanen et al.,
1991). accumulating evidence suggests that  xxxg1767xxx ,
when bound to its specific cell surface receptor, is involved in ecm degradation during tumor cell invasion
(pollanen et al., 1991; blasi, 1993). however, the role of
 xxxg1766xxx  in malignant invasion is still not clear. ossowski
(1988) showed that the enhancement of  xxxg1766xxx  production in hela cells did not increase the efficiency of invasion using a chorioallantoic membrane model. we established previously a human colon carcinoma cell line
named co115 (carrel et al., 1976) which produces in
culture only  xxxg1766xxx , but no  xxxg1767xxx  (cajot et al., 19861,and
which is able to degrade the r22 ecm in vitro (cajot et
al., 1990). these cells were shown to be highly invasive
and metastatic in vivo in nude mice (sordat and bogenmann, 1980). recent studies showed that  xxxg1766xxx  is able to

activate plasminogen on the surface of melanoma cells
and induce ecm degradation (bizik et al., 1990;
mimura et al., 1992; meissauer et al., 1991,1992; quax
et al., 1991b). the aim of the present study was to
investigate the mechanism of  xxxg1766xxx -mediated degradation of laminin, a major component of the ecm. we
specifically wanted to address the question whether
 xxxg1766xxx -mediated proteolysis induced by tumor cells is related to its secreted form or remains associated with the
cells. for this purpose, we developed a quantitative
radiolabeled laminin degradation assay to investigate
the contribution of co115 cells to the degradation of
laminin by  xxxg1766xxx .

cell culture
the human colon carcinoma cell lines co115 and
c0112 were previously described (carrel et al., 1976;
sutherland et al., 1986; cajot et al., 1986). cells were
grown to confluency in 75 cm2flasks in dmem with 5%
fcs. medium was changed 1 day before experimental
use. cells were trypsinized for 30 min with 7 ml of
trypsin-edta which was neutralized with 8 ml of 5%
fcs culture medium. cells were washed three times in
serum-free culture medium containing 1mgiml of bsa.
adjusted number of cells in 0.5 ml per well of bsamedium was used during the laminin degradation assay. in some experiments, co115 cells were used in
which protein biosynthesis was blocked by a 1-day
treatment in culture medium containing 10 pg/ml of
cycloheximide. then, the effect of the cells on laminin
degradation was determined in the presence of cycloheximide. for zymographic analysis, antigen determination of pas and pais, and for northern blot analysis,
cells were grown to confluency in 175 cm2 flasks. after
overnight incubation with fresh 5% fcs medium, cells
were incubated for defined incubation times in the
presence of serum-free medium or in the presence of 5%
fcs medium. the supernatants were collected, centrifuged, and stored a t -20°c for pa and  xxxd2211xxx  determinations. cells were counted or directly lysed for mrna
extractions. human ht29 colon carcinoma and
ht1080 human fibrosarcoma cells were used as negative and positive controls for mrna expression of pas,
pais, and  xxxg1768xxx . in some experiments, human colon
carcinoma cells were added in transwell rm inserts
(costar europe ltd., badhoevedorp, the netherlands)
with a membrane of 0.4 pm pore size. the co115 cell
conditioned medium was prepared a s follows: cells were
grown to confluency in 175 cm2 flask and incubated
overnight with fresh 5% fcs medium. after washing
with serum-free medium, cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h. the conditioned medium

was collected, centrifuged for 15 min a t 4"c, and the
supernatant kept a t -80°c until use. all cell lines used
were mycoplasma free.

experimental conditions
expression of pas and pais. pa activities of human colon carcinoma cells were characterized by zymography after sodium  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (sds-page) using copolymerized
plasminogen-rich fibrinogen (heussen and dowdle,
1980; cajot et al., 19891, whereas pa and  xxxd2211xxx  antigens
were determined using eias from biopool (tintelizeo
for  xxxg1766xxx ,  xxxg1767xxx , pai-1,  xxxg2053xxx ) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. northern blot analysis of the
pas, pais, and  xxxg1768xxx  using po1ya-t extracts from tumor cells was performed as described elsewhere (medcalf et al., 1986). the following cdna fragments were
used as probes: a 1.9 kb bgl i1 fragment of the human
 xxxg1766xxx  cdna, a 0.5 kb ecor i fragment of the human
 xxxg1767xxx  cdna, a 1.0 kb ecor i-pst i fragment of the human pai-1 cdna, a 1.9 kb ecor i fragment of the
human  xxxg2053xxx  cdna, a 1.1kb bamh i-ecor i fragment
of the  xxxg1768xxx  cdna (van zonneveld et al., 1986; ny et
al., 1986; schleuning et al., 1987; roldan et al., 19901,
and a 1.1 kb pst i fragment of the p-actin mouse cdna
(minty et al., 1983). zymography of unfixed cryostat
tissue sections from subcutaneous tumor xenografts
grown in nude mice was performed as described elsewhere (sappino et al., 1991). to this end, a suspension
of co115 cells or (20112 cells (1.5 lo6 in 0.1 ml) was
injected subcutaneously into nude mice. after 4 weeks,
tumors were removed and subjected to histologic examination and histozymographic analysis.
radiolabeled laminin degradation assay. the
assay was adapted from a solid-phase fibrin- xxxg1766xxx  activity assay (angles-cano, 1986). laminin was radioiodinated by the iodo-gen method (fraker and speck, 1978)
to a s ecific radioactivity of 1.2 pci/pmol of laminin.
the 'i-laminin was immobilized onto 24-well tissue
culture plates (costarm) by glutaraldehyde crosslinking. briefly, the wells were filled with 1 ml of 2.5%
glutaraldehyde in sodium bicarbonate buffer, ph 9.5,
left a t room temperature for 2 h, and washed three
times with 3 ml of sterile and distilled water. a mixture
of lz5i-laminin (100,000 cpm) and 1.5 pg unlabeled
laminin in pbs was added per well (final volume 200
p1) and left overnight a t room temperature with shaking to covalently crosslink laminin to the glutaraldehyde-treated surface. excess unbound laminin was removed, wells were washed with water, and the free
glutaraldehyde radicals were quenched by overnight
incubation with culture medium containing 1mg/ml of
bsa. the medium was discarded and the plates sealed
for storage a t 4°c until use. the proteolytic capacity of
tumor cells was investigated by seeding the cells in the
wells containing the crosslinked labeled laminin in the
presence of dmem containing 1 mgimlbsa and 10
pgiml of plasminogen. after defined incubation times,
the radioactivity released in the conditioned medium
was determined. nonspecific release of the radiolabeled
tracer measured by incubation with medium but in absence of plasminogen was subtracted from results and
was always less than 5%of total radioactivity released
by a 48-h incubation with 1ml of trypsin-edta.

results
pa, pai, and  xxxg1768xxx  characterization of human
colon carcinoma co115 and c0112 cell lines
to investigate the mechanism of  xxxg1766xxx -mediated degradation of laminin by colon carcinoma cells, we made
use of two cell types: co115 cells which were previously
shown to produce only  xxxg1766xxx  and col12 cells which were
shown to produce  xxxg1767xxx  (cajot et al., 1986). for the
purpose of the present article it was essential to have a
complete description of the phenotype of these two cell
lines with respect to the pa system. therefore, we
made a detailed analysis of  xxxg1766xxx ,  xxxg1767xxx , pai-1, and
 xxxg2053xxx  expression at the level of antigen and mrna.
this analysis revealed that co115 cells produce exclusively  xxxg1766xxx , whereas c0112 cells make exclusively
 xxxg1767xxx  (fig. 1).furthermore small amounts of  xxxg2053xxx  and
 xxxg1768xxx  mrna were detected in both cell lines, whereas
pai-1 mrna was below detection limit. ht1080 cells
were used as positive control for expression of  xxxg1767xxx ,  xxxg1766xxx ,
 xxxg1768xxx , and pai-1 and the ht29 cells which expressed
only small amounts of  xxxg1768xxx  transcripts were used as
negative control (fig. 1, lower part). in the presence of 10
pg/ml of cycloheximide  xxxg1766xxx  production by col15 cells
was reduced by more than 90% (fig. 1upper part, lane 6).

zymographic analysis of cryostat sections of the tumor
xenografts showed plasminogen-dependent lytic activity for both cell types. the activity of co115 xenografts
could not be blocked by 1 mm amiloride, a specific inhibitor of  xxxg1767xxx  (vassalli and belin, 19871, whereas
lytic activity of c0112 xenografts, used as a control, was
completely inhibited by amiloride (fig. 2). this result
indicates that the majority of pa activity of co115 xenografts in vivo is dependent on  xxxg1766xxx .

characterization of pa expression by (30115 and
c0112 cells in vivo in nude mice
the pa phenotype of tumor cells grown in vivo may
be different from that of in vitro. to determine which
pa was expressed in vivo by co115 and c0112 cells, the
tumor cells were injected subcutaneously in nude mice.

laminin degradation by human colon
carcinoma cells
when co115 or c0112 cells were added onto the glutaraldehyde-immobilized 1251-lamininplates and incubated for various time intervals, there was a time-dependent degradation of laminin as measured by the
release of the radiotracer into the supernatant (fig.
3a). in the absence of plasminogen no significant
amounts of radioactivity was released even after 48 h
incubation. laminin degradation was proportional to
the number of cells added onto the immobilized substrate (fig. 3b). the rate of degradation of laminin by
both cell types was similar. however, c0112 cells
showed a lag period of 12 h whereas co115 cells had no
lag period.
degradation of laminin by co115 cells is
mediated by  xxxg1766xxx 
the degradation of laminin by co115 cells was completely inhibited by 100 fgirnl of aprotinin, by 0.3 m
 xxxd146xxx , or by 100 fg/ml of polyclonal goat anti- xxxg1766xxx  igg

but not by anti- xxxg1767xxx  or nonimmune igg. these results
strongly suggest that laminin degradation induced by
co115 cells is plasminogen dependent and is mediated by
 xxxg1766xxx  (fig. 4).monoclonal or polyclonal rabbit anti- xxxg1768xxx 
igg at concentrations sufficient to block ecm degradation by  xxxg1767xxx  expressing cells (reiter e t al., 1993) did not
inhibit the laminin degradation induced by co115 cells
(data not shown).

laminin degradation mediated by  xxxg1766xxx  is
potentiated in the presence of co115 cells
to determine whether plasminogen activation is cell
surface associated, we studied laminin degradation by

various dilutions of co115 conditioned medium in the
presence or absence of cycloheximide-treated cells.
first, we determined the effect of cycloheximidetreated co115 cells alone, which produce little  xxxg1766xxx  (see
fi . 1)and observed negligible (<400cpm) release of
-1aminin. incubation of col15 conditioned medium
alone with the '"i-laminin plates led to a concentration-dependent release of laminin (fig. 5a). a marked
three to sevenfold increase of laminin degradation was
observed when the lz5i-lamininplates were incubated
with a mixture of cycloheximide-treated col15 cells
(fig. 5a). the same potentiating effect was observed
when recombinant  xxxg1766xxx  was used instead of co115 cell
conditioned medium (fig. 5b).

laminin degradation induced by co115 cells

when close contact between co115 cells and the surface of the laminin-coated wells was prevented by plating the cells in transwell'" inserts, and co115 conditioned medium directly on the 1251-laminin,the extent
of laminin degradation was only 20-30% of that measured when cells and medium were added directly onto
the laminin surface (fig. 6a). when co115 conditioned
medium was added in the transwell'" inserts, we observed the same potentiating effect of cycloheximidetreated co115 cells plated directly onto laminin surface. however, when cells were plated in the
transwell'" inserts together with conditioned medium,
a lower laminin degradation was observed.

discussion
the plasminogen activation system is thought to
play a key role in the degradation and remodeling of
peritumoral tissues in the course of malignant invasion
and metastasis. localized formation of plasmin induced
by pas a t the surface of tumor cells may be combined
with the production of various other proteases, such as
metalloproteases, cysteinyl, or aspartyl proteases to
permit malignant cells to migrate through normal host
tissues and to form distant metastases (reviewed by
dan@et al., 1985; pollanen et al., 1991; vassalli et al.,
1991). a substantial amount of data has been accumulated on the functional role of  xxxg1767xxx  bound to its specific
receptor located on the surface of tumor cells (ossowski

and reich, 1988; quax et al., 1991a; blasi, 1993). in
contrast, the role of  xxxg1766xxx  in invasive processes is still
not evident, perhaps because most tumor cells produce
 xxxg1767xxx  instead of  xxxg1766xxx  with some exceptions such as melanoma, neuroblastoma, and certain leukemic cells (bizik et al., 1990; neuman et al., 1989; quax et al., 1991b;
wilson et al., 1983). the human colon carcinoma co115
cell line, which produces only  xxxg1766xxx  and was established
in our laboratory as a tumorigenic and metastatic cell
line in nude mice (sordat and bogenmann, 1980), provides as a unique opportunity to investigate the mechanism of ecm degradation by  xxxg1766xxx  in the absence of
interfering effects of  xxxg1767xxx  or pais.
a more detailed analysis of (30115 cells confirmed
that they produce only  xxxg1766xxx , as examined by zymographic analysis and antigenic determinations of pas

laminin degradation by  xxxg1766xxx  producing colon carcinoma

and pais. northern blot analysis demonstrated that
co115 cells expressed  xxxg1766xxx  and not  xxxg1767xxx  nor pai-1
whereas small amounts of  xxxg1768xxx  and  xxxg2053xxx  transcripts
were detected. no  xxxg2053xxx  antigen was however detectable in co115 cell conditioned medium. moreover, the
phenotype of co115 with regard to  xxxg1766xxx  expression of
subcutaneously injected tumor cells in nude mice appeared to be the same of c o i i 5 cells in culture only. we
developed a 1251-labeled laminin degradation assay
with glutaraldehyde-immobilized laminin which allows the quantitative measurement of the laminin degradation potential of tumor cells, particularly of the pa
system. our results show that co115 cells which produced only  xxxg1766xxx  were able to degrade laminin with the
same efficacy as c0112 cells which produce only  xxxg1767xxx .
laminin degradation by co115 cells is plasminogen
dependent and is mediated by  xxxg1766xxx . our results extend
to a human colonic epithelial malignant cell type those
reported by others which suggested that activation of
plasminogen by  xxxg1766xxx  is localized on the surface of human
melanoma cells (bizik et al., 1990,1993; meissauer et al.,
1992).however, whether  xxxg1766xxx  is bound or not to a specific
receptor on the surface of tumor cells is still unknown.
several forms of a putative cell binding receptor for  xxxg1766xxx 
were recently identified in various cell types (hajjar et
al., 1987; hajjar, 1991; liesi et al., 1990) but we first
report in the present work direct evidence demonstrating
a cell-associated potentiation of  xxxg1766xxx  activity.
