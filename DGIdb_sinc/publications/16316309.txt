 xxxd1722xxx , a synthesised adenosine nucleoside, has recently demonstrated
single-agent activity in the acute leukaemias. originally developed to capture
the best qualities of cladribine and  xxxd2120xxx ,  xxxd1722xxx  contains halogenated carbons, rendering it resistant to inactivating enzymes and maintaining its stability in acidic environments. like other adenosine nucleosides,
 xxxd1722xxx  acts by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase and dna polymerase,
thereby depleting the amount of intracellular deoxynucleoside triphosphates
available for dna replication and also resulting in premature dna chain termination.  xxxd1722xxx  has also been shown to induce apoptosis in transformed cell lines, indicating that  xxxd1722xxx  results in cell death in both
cycling and non-cycling cells. interest in the development of  xxxd1722xxx  was
initially hampered by the availability of other active nucleoside analogues for
the treatment of haematological malignancies. however, the results of several early-phase trials evaluating the use of  xxxd1722xxx  in acute leukaemias
in adults and children have rekindled enthusiasm for further investigation
into its use. this article describes the development, pharmacology, toxicity
and clinical activity of  xxxd1722xxx , as well as discuss its potential role in the
treatment of acute leukaemia.

purine nucleosides are important agents in the treatment of malignant haematological diseases. cladribine,  xxxd2120xxx  and  xxxd2879xxx  have shown success in
the treatment of low-grade lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (cll)
and hairy-cell leukaemia (hcl).  xxxd1722xxx , a synthesised  xxxd2705xxx 
analogue, is an adenosine analogue that has safely demonstrated single-agent
activity in acute leukaemia. figure 1 shows the chemical structures of  xxxd1722xxx ,
 xxxd2120xxx  and cladribine.  xxxd1722xxx  inhibits dna polymerases that are important for dna synthesis and repair, as well as ribonucleotide reductase, thereby
reducing the intracellular pool of nucleotides available for dna synthesis.  xxxd1722xxx  has also demonstrated efficacy in several phase i and ii studies of patients with
acute myeloid leukaemia (aml) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (all), both as
a single agent and in combination with  xxxd1790xxx .

introduction

mechanisms of action

the mechanism of action of  xxxd1722xxx  is well described [1-4], and is not dissimilar
to that of its analogues,  xxxd2120xxx  and cladribine.  xxxd1722xxx  is considered both

an s-phase specific and cell-cycle phase non-specific agent. it
is transported into the intracellular compartment by the
membrane adenosine transport protein es (equilibrative inhibitor-sensitive) [5]. subsequently,  xxxd1722xxx  undergoes phosphorylation to its active triphosphate state by the enzyme,
2´- xxxg611xxx  ( xxxg611xxx ).  xxxd1722xxx  triphosphate
directly inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, and reduces the
amount of intracellular deoxynucleoside triphosphates
(dntps) available for dna synthesis. in addition,  xxxd1722xxx  triphosphate itself is incorporated into dna during synthesis and repair, resulting in inhibition of dna polymerase
and dna chain termination.
parker et al. [1] studied the effects of  xxxd1722xxx  on the
k562 chronic myelogenous leukaemia (cml) cell line, in
order to clarify its mechanism of action. they found that
 xxxd1722xxx  5 nm significantly inhibited the growth of k562
cells in a culture-based system. competition studies with normal nucleosides confirmed that  xxxg611xxx  was the enzyme responsible for metabolising  xxxd1722xxx  to its monophosphate form.
after incubation with  xxxd1722xxx , diminished amounts of
 xxxd1148xxx  ( xxxd1148xxx ),  xxxd1836xxx  triphosphate and  xxxd1837xxx  were observed, suggesting inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase.  xxxd1722xxx 
effectively inhibited dna polymerase alpha, and was incorporated into dna by dna polymerase alpha as efficiently as  xxxd1148xxx .
lastly, the incorporation of  xxxd1722xxx  into dna effectively
inhibited further strand elongation.
the activity of the nucleoside analogues, specifically
cladribine and  xxxd2879xxx , in lymphoproliferative diseases,
such as cll and hcl, is determined not only by their
effects on dividing cells, but also their toxicity to quiescent
lymphocytes [6]. in order to determine if  xxxd1722xxx  would
have similar properties, carson et al. [2] injected mice with
 xxxg1176xxx  (scid) with cll cells
and treated the animals with oral  xxxd1722xxx . they found
that cell killing was preceded by dna strand breaks, which
led to oligonucleosomal dna fragmentation characteristic
of apoptosis. more recently, genini et al. [7] have demonstrated that both cladribine and  xxxd1722xxx  cause direct
mitochondrial damage to cll cells, resulting in the release
of apoptosis-inducing factor – a possible mechanism by
2712

which these agents are able to induce programmed death in
non-cycling cells.
3.

mechanisms of resistance

relatively little has been published regarding resistance to
 xxxd1722xxx . lotfi et al. [8] demonstrated acquired resistance to
 xxxd1722xxx  in ccrf-cem (human t-lymphoblastic) and
hl60 (human aml) cell lines by incubating cells with
increasing concentrations of  xxxd1722xxx  over time. they generated resistant cell lines that were 1000-fold less sensitive to
the growth inhibitory and cytotoxic effects of  xxxd1722xxx  than
wild-type cells. these cells also showed cross-resistance to
cladribine and  xxxd2120xxx . furthermore, the resistant cells
accumulated lower amounts of  xxxd1722xxx  nucleotides. western blot analysis revealed no detectable  xxxg611xxx  in the resistant
cell lines, whereas the wild-type cells had easily measurable
levels. carson et al. [2] demonstrated resistance to  xxxd1722xxx 
in three lymphoblast cell lines, one deficient in  xxxg611xxx , one with
increased ribonucleotide reductase activity and the last with
elevated 5´-nucleotidase activity. these studies taken together
indicate that common mechanisms of resistance are responsible for acquired resistance to adenosine analogues, including
 xxxd1722xxx , and result largely from decreased levels of  xxxg611xxx  in
cells chronically exposed to these agents [8,9].
4.

pharmacology/pharmacokinetics

the synthesis of  xxxd1722xxx  was an attempt to augment the
best qualities of cladribine and  xxxd2120xxx , while improving
upon their limitations [10]. a chloride at the c2-position of
deoxyadenosine renders  xxxd1722xxx  resistant to adenosine
deaminase, whereas fluorine in the 2´-arabino position prevents phosphorylysis and inactivation by bacterial purine
 xxxg1792xxx  [2,10]. in addition, the 2´-arabino
fluorine improves the acid stability of the compound [11].
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1722xxx  were evaluated in
adult patients enrolled in a phase i study investigating its
use [12]. during the phase i portion of the trial, patients with
refractory solid tumours and haematological malignancies
were evaluated for the maximum tolerated dose (mtd). the

initial dose of  xxxd1722xxx  was 4 mg/m2/day for 5 days, given
as a 1-h intravenous infusion. the mtd for patients with
solid tumours was 2 mg/m2/day and the dose-limiting toxicity
(dlt) was myelosuppression. however, for patients with
acute leukaemia (aml, all, cml in blast phase), the dose
was escalated stepwise to 55 mg/m2/day, with which significant, but reversible, hepatotoxicity was observed, thus defining the dlt [13]. therefore, the mtd was determined to be
40 mg/m2/day for 5 days for adults with acute leukaemia.
when  xxxd1722xxx  40 mg/m2 was infused over a 1-h period,
the median peak plasma concentration at the mtd was
1.5 µm [12], which was well above the toxic level in cultured
k562 cml cells [1]. the plasma concentration of  xxxd1722xxx 
was proportional to the dose infused [12].  xxxd1722xxx  was
47% bound to plasma proteins, predominantly to albumin.
elimination is primarily via renal excretion, with 49 – 60% of
the dose excreted unchanged in the urine. the pathways of
non-renal elimination are unknown. it is not likely that
 xxxd1722xxx  is metabolised by the cytochrome p450 enzyme
system. systemic clearance and volume of distribution at
steady-state in paediatric patients were estimated to be
28.8 l/h/m2 and 172 l/m2, respectively. the terminal half-life
was estimated to be 5.2 h. no apparent differences in pharmacokinetics were observed between patients with all or aml,
or between males and females [14].
once  xxxd1722xxx  is intracellular, it is phosphorylated by
 xxxg611xxx  to its monophosphate form. interestingly, the activity
of  xxxg611xxx , the rate-limiting enzyme for many of the adenosine analogues, was not found to be rate limiting with
 xxxd1722xxx , and the drug’s accumulation in leukaemic
blasts seems to be dependent upon phosphorylation of
 xxxd1722xxx  monophosphate [8]. ghandhi et al. [12] demonstrated in paediatric patients that the levels of intracellular
 xxxd1722xxx  triphosphate in leukaemic blasts were dosedependent until 30 mg/m2, when proportionality was lost,
possibly indicating saturation of the membrane transport
proteins. there was no difference in the levels of  xxxd1722xxx  triphosphate between patients with aml and all.
similarly, both myeloid and lymphoid blasts retained
> 50% of their original  xxxd1722xxx  triphosphate levels at
24 h, suggesting similar cellular pharmacokinetics. dna
synthesis was 90% inhibited 2 h after treatment with
30 mg/m2 of  xxxd1722xxx . however, by day 4 of a 5-day
treatment course, leukaemic blasts had regained 80% of
their pretreatment dna synthesis capability. in contrast, at
doses of 55 mg/m2, dna synthesis was > 90% inhibited,
and remained so for ≥ 72 h.
5.

toxicities

common toxicities associated with  xxxd1722xxx  are listed in
table 1. the phase i trial evaluating  xxxd1722xxx  in adult
patients with relapsed or refractory solid and haematological
malignancies defined quite different mtds in those two
groups of patients [13]. a dose of  xxxd1722xxx  2 mg/m2/day for

5 days was defined as the mtd in patients with solid
tumours, and the dlt was grade 4 myelosuppression. however, when haematological toxicity was not a criterion for
stopping the dose escalation, the mtd for patients with acute
leukaemia was 40 mg/m2/day for 5 days, and the dlt was
severe reversible hepatotoxicity at 55 mg/m2/day [13]. interestingly, the original starting dose of  xxxd1722xxx  in this study
had been 15 mg/m2/day for 5 days, and was based on animal
toxicology data. this dose was found to be sevenfold greater
than the mtd in humans with solid tumours; similar early
experience was found with  xxxd2120xxx , where initial doses of
≥ 125 mg/m2/day resulted in severe neurological toxicity and
death in five out of nine patients treated [15]. the striking
pharmacokinetic difference between dogs and humans is
likely to be explained by lower levels of  xxxg611xxx  in dogs and a
higher volume of distribution in humans [13], possibly resulting in increased activation and delayed clearance of adenosine
nucleosides in human subjects.
the mtd has also been examined in paediatric patients
with aml and all. at 70 mg/m2/day for 5 days, the dlt in
this cohort was reversible hepatotoxicity and skin rash. therefore, the mtd for paediatric leukaemia patients was defined
as 52 mg/m2/day [16].
febrile neutropaenia has been a common toxicity associated with  xxxd1722xxx -induced myelosuppression, and
occurs in > 81% of patients [17]. the median time to
achieve an absolute neutrophil count (anc) of 1 × 109/l
after treatment was 28 days [17,18]. the median time to
achieve a platelet count > 100 × 109/l was 31 days in one
study [17], whereas results in older patients revealed a
median time to a platelet count of 50 × 109/l of 25 days [18].
other common side effects of  xxxd1722xxx  include skin rash,
palmar-plantar erythrodysethesia [19], mucositis, nausea,
vomiting and diarrhoea [17].
6.

clinical experience

adult phase i trials
the first phase i trial of  xxxd1722xxx  in adults evaluated its use
in patients with refractory solid tumours and haematological
cancers [13]. the results pertaining to the acute leukaemias
(aml, all and cml in blast phase) will be discussed here.
patients included in the study had relapsed or refractory disease, and had a median age of 42 years (range, 19 – 78 years).
a total of 16 patients had aml, 13 had all and 3 had cml
in blast phase. most had received more than two prior salvage
regimens. subjects received  xxxd1722xxx  11.25 – 55 mg/m2/day,
infused over 1 h, for 5 days. of 32 patients treated, 2 (6%)
achieved a complete response and 3 (9%) experienced haematological improvement, defined as similar to a complete
response, but without platelet recovery to ≥ 100 × 109/l
(table 2). the disease-specific responses were as follows: two
patients with aml responded, one with a complete response
and the other with haematological improvement; two patients
with all also responded, one with a complete response and

one with haematological improvement; one patient with cml
in blast phase achieved haematological improvement. the
overall response rate was 16%. three patients (9%) suffered
from early death, defined as death within 2 weeks of the start
of therapy.
paediatric phase i trials
jeha et al. [16] have reported results of a phase i trial examining
the role of  xxxd1722xxx  in paediatric patients with relapsed or
refractory all and aml. in total, 25 patients were enrolled,
8 with aml and 17 with all. the median ages were 8.5 and
12 years, respectively. patients had all received between one
and six prior regimens, and 36% had undergone prior stem
cell transplantation. subjects received 11.25 – 70 mg/m2/day
for 5 days. five patients (20%) achieved a complete response
and three (12%) had a partial response, with an overall
response rate of 32%. an additional four patients (16%)
experienced haematological improvement, defined as marrow
complete response or partial response without recovery of
peripheral blood counts. disease-specific responses revealed
that four patients with all and one with aml achieved a
complete response, and one patient with all and two with
aml achieved a partial response (table 3).
6.2

adult phase ii single agent trials
following the promising results from phase i trials, a phase ii
investigation of  xxxd1722xxx  in patients with relapsed/refractory
acute leukaemia was initiated [17]. a total of 62 adults with a
median age of 54 years (range, 19 – 82 years) were
included. in total, 31 patients had aml, 8 had high-risk
myelodysplastic syndrome (mds), 11 had cml in blast
phase and 12 had all. this cohort was generally less-heavily pretreated when compared with the patients enrolled in
the phase i trial, as only 42% of these patients were receiving  xxxd1722xxx  for treatment of second or higher relapse.
 xxxd1722xxx  was given at a dose of 40 mg/m2/day for
5 days. two remission induction courses were allowed on
study, and patients entering a complete response could
receive up to six consolidation courses of  xxxd1722xxx , at the
discretion of the treating physician.
a total of 20 patients (32%) achieved a complete response,
1 patient with cml in blast phase (2%) had a partial
response (similar to complete response in cml in blast phase,
6.3

2714

but with a persistence of > 5% immature cells), and 9 (15%)
had a complete response with incomplete recovery of platelets
(crp). the overall response rate was 48%. those with aml
responded most favourably, with complete response and crp
rates of 42 and 13%, respectively. therefore, the overall
response rate in patients with aml was 55%. not surprisingly, a longer first complete remission (cr1) was associated
with a higher response rate. in total, 50% of the mds
patients achieved objective responses, with two patients
(25%) having a complete response and two patients (25%) a
crp.  xxxd1722xxx  demonstrated only modest activity in the
12 subjects with all. one patient (8%) achieved a complete
response and one had a crp (8%) with an overall response
rate of 16% (table 2). the duration of responses ranged from
1 month to > 10 months for patients with aml and all.
the median survival in this trial was ∼ 7 months.
 xxxd1722xxx  was also evaluated in a phase ii front-line study
for older adults with aml who were deemed unfit to receive
standard chemotherapy based upon advanced age or cardiac
history [18]. a total of 28 patients with a median age of
71 years (range, 60 – 79 years) were enrolled. a dose of
 xxxd1722xxx  30 mg/m2/day for 5 days given in this trial was
slightly lower than in the previous study. in total, 16 patients
(59%) achieved a complete response after a single course of
 xxxd1722xxx , and three patients experienced a partial clearing
of bone marrow blasts (table 2). no estimate of remission
duration or survival was reported.
paediatric phase ii single agent trials
results of two multi-centre phase ii trials of  xxxd1722xxx  in
relapsed/refractory paediatric leukaemia were recently
reported [20-22]. the trial enrolled 100 paediatric patients,
60 with all and 40 with aml, and data are available for
49 patients with all and 35 with aml (table 3). the
median age was 12 years (range 1 – 22 years), and the median
number of prior regimens was three. of the patients, ∼ 40%
had previously undergone stem cell transplantation.  xxxd1722xxx  was administered at 52 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days,
and cycles were repeated every 2 – 6 weeks as clinically indicated. a preliminary report revealed an overall response rate of
29%. in patients with all, the rate of response was 31%
with six patients achieving a complete response, four a crp
and five a partial response. the response rate was not as
favourable for the children with aml – only one patient
(3%) achieved a crp and eight (20%) achieved a partial
response. the median durations of remission for responding
patients with all and aml were 10 and 16 weeks, respectively. median survival in responding all and aml patients
was 42 and 39 weeks, respectively. for non-responding or
non-evaluable patients, the median survivals were 7.4 and
12.4 weeks for those with all and aml, respectively. the
contribution of  xxxd1722xxx  to these outcomes was confounded by the fact that many children received a stem cell
transplant shortly after receiving  xxxd1722xxx . non-responders
and non-evaluable patients had very poor outcomes.

adult phase i/ii trials of  xxxd1722xxx  in
combination with  xxxd1790xxx 

6.5

because  xxxd1722xxx  is a potent inhibitor of ribonucleotide
reductase and has demonstrated activity against acute leukaemia, the hypothesis that  xxxd1722xxx  could potentiate the
activity of  xxxd1790xxx  in vitro was tested. cooper et al. [23]
demonstrated in a human cml cell line that incubation with
 xxxd1722xxx , followed by  xxxd1790xxx , resulted in intracellular
accumulation of  xxxd1790xxx  triphosphate and increased leukaemia cell killing. faderl et al. [24] enrolled 32 patients with
refractory leukaemia (25 aml, 4 high-risk mds, 2 all,
1 cml in blast phase) in a phase i/ii study investigating the
efficacy of  xxxd1722xxx  in combination with  xxxd1790xxx . the
median age was 59 years (range 18 – 84 years). of the
patients, 75% were in first relapse, with median cr1
durations of 7.6 and 5.2 months for the phase i and ii

patients, respectively. subjects received 5 days of intermediate-dose  xxxd1790xxx  1g/m2/day, given as a 2-h infusion, beginning 4 h after the daily  xxxd1722xxx  infusion, based on the
in vitro [23] and in vivo data [17]. during the phase i portion of
the trial,  xxxd1722xxx  was given on days 2 through to 6 and
dose-escalated safely to 40 mg/m2/day. therefore,  xxxd1790xxx 
was given alone on day 1 and  xxxd1722xxx  was given alone on
day 6. patients were allowed two cycles of induction therapy
and up to six cycles of the same consolidation therapy, as
determined by the treating physician.
among all patients, seven (22%) achieved a complete
response and five (16%) a crp, with an overall response rate
of 38%. there were no documented responses in patients
with all or cml. those with aml/mds achieved an
overall response rate of 41% (24% complete response,
17% crp). with a reported follow-up of 14.2 months, the

was lower than that in the phase ii trial evaluating  xxxd1722xxx  as a single agent, where the complete response rate in
aml patients was 42%. the authors speculate that the doseescalation of  xxxd1722xxx  from a low starting dose, as well as
patient selection, may have played a role in this finding.
based on these data, faderl et al. [25] conducted a phase ii
trial evaluating the efficacy of  xxxd1722xxx  in combination with
 xxxd1790xxx  as front-line therapy for adults ≥ 50 years of age with
aml or high-risk mds. patients with good prognosis karyotypes were excluded. both  xxxd1722xxx  and  xxxd1790xxx  were
given as in the phase i/ii study described above. in total,
60 patients with a median age of 61 years (range, 50 – 74 years)
were enrolled. of these patients, 53 had aml and 8 had highrisk mds (7 refractory anaemia with excess blasts – who classification group 2, 1 chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia –
who classification group 2). a total of 31 patients (52%)
achieved a complete response and five (8%) acheived a crp,
with an overall response rate of 60%. nine patients (15%) died
while on study. the complete response rate seen in this trial is
in keeping with complete response rates for other induction
regimens for older adults. remission duration and survival were
not reported in this analysis (table 4).
additional studies are now underway to evaluate  xxxd1722xxx 
at 30 mg/m2 for 5 days with low dose  xxxd1790xxx  (20 mg/m2
s.c. for 7 – 14 days). a phase i study of  xxxd2320xxx  plus
 xxxd1722xxx  and  xxxd1790xxx  is also in progress [26].

overview of the market

acute leukaemia is the most common malignancy diagnosed
in children; all accounts for the majority of cases. approximately 2400 children < 20 years of age develop all
annually [27]. since the 1960s, both remission and cure rates
for paediatric all have improved dramatically with the
2716

development of intensive induction chemotherapy regimens
and cns prophylaxis. current cure rates are ∼ 80%. however, children and infants harbouring the philadelphia chromosome, generated by the t(9;22)(q34;q11) or mll gene
rearrangements secondary to t(4;11), t(11;19) and t(1;11),
fare poorly [28]. allogeneic stem cell transplantation is often
the only potentially curative modality for children with
high-risk leukaemias. when all relapses after standard
therapy,  xxxd1722xxx  may not only serve to reinduce remission in these patients, but may also provide a bridge to stem
cell transplantation.
in the paediatric phase i study by jeha et al. [16], the use of
 xxxd1722xxx  in children with relapsed/refractory all resulted
in a response rate of 30%. four out of five responding
patients were able to proceed to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. furthermore, a phase ii trial examining  xxxd1722xxx  in paediatric relapsed/refractory all reported a response
rate of 31% (15/49 patients) [22]. in total, 54% of responding patients subsequently received a stem cell transplant.
based on these data, the fda granted accelerated approval
for  xxxd1722xxx  for use in paediatric patients with relapsed or
refractory all.

expert opinion and conclusions

effective therapies for relapsed/refractory aml and all in
adults are lacking, and such patients are unlikely to be
cured with currently available chemotherapy. new agents
able to induce sustained remissions in this population are
needed.  xxxd1722xxx  has been able to do so as a single agent
in a number of heavily pretreated patients. data from clinical trials have demonstrated that ∼ 10 and 40% of adult
patients with relapsed/refractory all and aml,
respectively, can achieve a complete response with
single-agent  xxxd1722xxx . however, such remissions tend to
be short-lived, and even with additional courses of
consolidation therapy, these patients are unlikely to be
cured with  xxxd1722xxx  alone. in younger patients with relapsed
acute leukaemia,  xxxd1722xxx  can be used to reinduce remission

and reduce disease burden prior to allogeneic stem cell
transplantation. in older adults or those who are not candidates for aggressive therapy,  xxxd1722xxx , with its acceptable side effect profile, can provide patients with a period of
remission, or leukaemic control, allowing for symptom
relief that may lead to improved quality of life.
older patients with aml fare poorly overall. standard
induction regimens induce remission in ∼ 50% of patients,
but only 10% are alive at 3 years [29]. furthermore, many
older patients with newly diagnosed aml suffer from
comorbid diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, coronary
artery disease and congestive heart failure. obviously, avoidance of anthracyclines in this population of patients is desirable. preliminary data suggest that in older patients with
comorbid illnesses, initial therapy with  xxxd1722xxx  can
induce complete response in ∼ 60% of patients, while maintaining an acceptable induction death rate of 17%. these
outcomes compare favourably with those after standard
induction regimens in more fit, older patients [29]. however,
larger studies are needed in this population to confirm these
early results [30].
 xxxd1722xxx  has also been tested in combination with
 xxxd1790xxx  in newly diagnosed adults ≥ 50 years of age with

aml/mds. early results demonstrate a complete response
rate of 50%, with an induction death rate of 4%. remission
duration and overall survival have not yet been reported. currently, a randomised study of  xxxd1722xxx  with or without low
dose  xxxd1790xxx  (20 mg/m2/day for 7 – 14 days) is being
undertaken in older patients with aml/mds [31].
the only fda-approved use of  xxxd1722xxx  is for paediatric patients with relapsed/refractory all after at least two
prior regimens. in this patient cohort, the overall response
rate to  xxxd1722xxx  is 30% (complete response, crp, haematological improvement), and some patients were able
proceed to allogeneic stem cell transplantation following
treatment with  xxxd1722xxx .  xxxd1722xxx  can now be considered a standard treatment option to reinduce remission or
reduce disease burden in children with advanced all.
curiously, the results with  xxxd1722xxx  in paediatric patients
with advanced aml have not been as favourable as for
those with all or for adults with aml. therefore,  xxxd1722xxx  should not be used in routine management of such
patients. an oral preparation of  xxxd1722xxx  is under development. oral bioavailability of 50% has been reported [31].
future studies will further elucidate the role of  xxxd1722xxx 
in paediatric and adult acute leukaemia.
