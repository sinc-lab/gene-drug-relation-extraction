abstract-a
number of physiological and synthetic progestins were tested for their ability to compete
with [3h]dexamethasone for the binding to the  xxxg1601xxx  of human mononuclear leukocytes
and their ability to elicit glucocorticoid-like effects on the same cells. as compared to the reference
compound dexamethasone (relative receptor binding affinity defined as 1000/o), two potent synthetic
progestins with a pregnane-type structure,  xxxd2557xxx  and  xxxd2554xxx . were
found to display a considerable binding affinity towards the receptor (46 and 42%, respectively). the
relative binding affinity of the naturally occurring ligand, cortisol, to the receptor was clearly lower
(25%). the effective binding of medroxyprogesterone
acetate to the  xxxg1601xxx  was
confirmed by direct binding studies utilizing a tritiated derivative of this steroid. no evidence for the
existence of a specific  xxxg1737xxx  in human mononuclear leukocytes was obtained as judged
by the results of competition experiments where a  xxxg1737xxx -specific ligand [3h]org 2058
was used. medroxyprogesterone
acetate and  xxxd2557xxx  also induced glucocorticoid-like effects
on the lymphocyte functions. these included inhibition of the proliferative responses to the t-cell
mitogens  xxxd2620xxx  and phytohaemagglutinin and an enhanced accumulation of immunoglobulin
secreting cells in pokeweed mitogen-stimulated cultures. the progestin effect appears to be mediated
through a radiosensitive (suppressor) subpopulation of t lymphocytes. in contrast, the synthetic
progestins related structurally to 19_nortestosterone,  xxxd2751xxx  and d- xxxd2754xxx , were virtually
devoid of binding affinity towards the  xxxg1601xxx  nor did they measurably influence the in
vitro lymphocyte functions. these studies demonstrate that certain progestins in common clinical use
probably possess inherent glucocorticoid activity and suggest that side effects attributable to this
character (e.g. suppression of the pituitary-adrenal axis) might be expected when these compounds are
used in pharmacological doses.

the present opinion about the mechanism of steroid
action maintains
[l-3] that the steroid molecule

freely permeates the target cell membrane and binds
to a soluble cytoplasmic receptor. the resulting
steroid-receptor complex undergoes a process called
“transformation” and is then able to bind to nuclear
acceptor sites. this interaction triggers an increase
in the rate of the transcription of specific dna
sequences, ultimately leading to augmented mrna
and protein synthesis along with alterations in cell
functioning.
progesterone has been shown to display some
affinity towards glucocorticoid receptors with various
experimental systems [4-71. this steroid, however,
seems to display a peculiar duality since it acts as a
glucocorticoid agonist in cultured mouse lymphoma
cells [8] and in rat thymocytes [9] while it behaves
as an almost pure glucocorticoid antagonist in cultured rat hepatoma cells [lo] and in the mouse mammary tumor system [ll]. several authors have

and
norethynodrel [12-e]. progesterone and  xxxd2554xxx  have also been found to suppress the antibody production in rabbits after active
immunization [ 131.
it is possible that also in the human being progestins possess inherent
glucocorticoid
activity.
thus, progesterone to some degree competes with
potent glucocorticoids for the binding to glucocorticoid receptors in human circulating white cells
[16-201. numerous studies indicate that lymphocytes
from pregnant women in the presence of maternal
serum [21] show impaired in vitro responsiveness to
phytohaemagglutinin
(pha) [22-251 and depressed
mixed lymphocyte reactivity [26,27]. the addition
of progesterone,
17a- xxxd2303xxx 
and
20&-dihydroprogesterone to lymphocyte cultures has
been reported to suppress mitogen and antigen
induced blast transformation [2&30].

the t-cell population contained less than 1% surface

determination of the relative binding affinities of
the various steroids towards the  xxxg1601xxx . the non-labelled steroids were prepared in vari-

ous dilutions in ethanol and pipetted in duplicate
(usually in amounts of 0.1-0.2 ml) to disposable polystyrene tubes. the tubes were evaporated to dryness
on a stream of nitrogen whereafter 10 ,ul of ethanol
was added to augment the solubility of the compounds. the final concentration of ethanol in the
incubations (1%) did not affect the binding properties of the receptor.
the tritiated
ligand
([3h]dexamethasone,
[3h]medroxyprogesterone
acetate or [3h]org 2058, as indicated in the
text) was added (in 0.2ml of rpmi-1640 with 50
mmol/l hepes,
ph 7.5; final concentration
2-3 x 10-8mol/l) and the tubes mixed with gentle
shaking. aliquots of 0.8 ml of the mononuclear cell
suspension were then pipetted to the tubes followed
by their incubation for 45 min at +37”. the extent
of nonspecific binding of the tracer was always estimated from incubations containing a 200-fold excess
of the corresponding non-radioactive ligand. after
incubation, 2ml of cold pbs (phosphate buffered
saline; nacl 8g/liter, kc1 0.2g/liter,
nazhpoj
1.15 g/liter and kh2p040.2g/liter)
were added to
each tube, the cells collected by centrifugation and
then washed two times with 3 ml of pbs (at +22”).
during each wash, the cells were maintained for 10
min at 22” before centrifugation. the washed cell
pellets were suspended in a mixture of 0.5 ml of pbs
and 1 .oml of ethanol and then transferred to liquid
scintillation vials for subsequent radioactivity counting. after correction for non-specific binding, competition curves for all the steroids were constructed
and the relative binding affinities (relative to
dexamethasone = 100%) of the different ligands to
the  xxxg1601xxx  were calculated at the
50% competition level as described by korenman

were first diluted in ethanol at a concentration of
10 mg/ml, and this stock solution was further diluted
in rpmi-1640 culture medium to reach the concentrations indicated. the amount of ethanol (0.1%)
which was present in the strongest steroid concentrations had no measurable effect on the proliferative
response or the generation of ig-producing cells. the
proliferative responses of mitogen-stimulated
cultures were measured by addition of 0.4&i of tritiated thymidine ([3h]tdr; new en land nuclear,

human mononuclear cells were incubated with
increasing concentrations
of [3h]-dexamethasone,
[3h]-medroxyprogesterone
acetate or [3h]-org 2058
and the resultant specific binding plotted according
to scatchard (fig. 1). linear binding curves were
obtained for [3h]-dexamethasone and [3h]- xxxd2554xxx  with kds of 1.0 x 10m8mol/l
and 3.1 x 10-8mol/l, respectively, and there were
about 4500 saturable binding sites/cell for both steroids. on the contrary, no significant amount of saturable binding was found when [3h]org 2058 was
used as the ligand (fig. l), no matter whether the
experiment was performed at +4” or +22” (data not
shown) instead of +37” as routinely; the extent of
nonspecific binding of [3h]org 2058 amounted to
about 0.2% of the total steroid concentration used.
competition curves for selected compounds are
illustrated in fig. 2. in cases where significant competition by the compounds with [3h]dexamethasone
occurred, the resultant competition curves were
roughly parallel. the relative binding affinities of
the compounds tested, as calculated on the molar

measured as pfc response (fig. 5). at very high

discussion

we demonstrate here that certain progestins efficiently compete with [3h]dexamethasone for the
binding sites in human mononuclear cells. previous
studies have indicated that dexamethasone is virtually specific for the  xxxg1601xxx  with
no significant affinity to the  xxxg1737xxx 
[39]. that the competition of the progestins indeed
occurs at the  xxxg1601xxx  sites is further
supported by two facts. first, we did not find any
evidence for the presence of  xxxg1737xxx 
in the mononuclear leukocytes as judged by the
experiments where [3h]org 2058, a highly specific
steroid for the progesterone receptors [40], was used
as the radioligand
(fig. 1). second, tritiated
medroxyprogesterone
acetate was more efficiently
displaced from the binding sites in the leukocytes by
potent glucocorticoids than by progestins (fig. 3).
it is especially noteworthy that  xxxd2751xxx , which
binds almost equally as compared to  xxxd2554xxx  to the human  xxxg1737xxx  [41], was not able to displace [3h]medroxypro-

gesterone from the receptor sites in the mononuclear
cells (fig. 3).
certain caveats should be born in mind when
interpreting
results of this type of competition
study.
one might suspect some metabolism
of the steroids
to occur during the incubation
period. we tested
this possibility
(data not shown) by subjecting
a
selected group of tritiated compounds
(dexamethasone, progesterone,
cortisol, org 2058, medroxyprogesterone
acetate,
d- xxxd2754xxx )
to thin-layer
chromatography
on silica gel plates before and after
45 min incubation at +37” in the presence of human
mononuclear
leukocytes.
no metabolic conversions
took place as judged by the co-chromatography
of
each test compound before and after the incubation.
another word of caution concerns the unavoidable
possibility that some serum steroid binding proteins
may have remained
adherent
to the mononuclear
leukocytes
after their isolation. in this respect it is
of importance
that the reference
compound
dexamethasone does not bind [42] to the relevant serum
binder, transcortin,
which suggests that the relative

binding affinity data are not liable to any systematic
bias.
we conclude that, as far as the receptor aspect is
concerned,
two subgroups among biologically active
progestins
[41] can be categorized.
one group
includes compounds with a pregnane structure (e.g.
progesterone,
 xxxd2557xxx 
acetate,
medroxyprogesterone
acetate) which bind efficiently, not only
to the progesterone
receptor
[41] but also to the
glucocorticoid
receptor (table 1). the other group
comprises
steroids with a structure
derived from
19-nortestosterone
(e.g.  xxxd2751xxx ,
d- xxxd2754xxx ) which bind avidly to the progesterone
receptor
[41] without remarkable affinity to the glucocorticoid
receptor (table 1). the progestin specificity of the
latter group is, however,
limited by the fact that
these
compounds
possess
intrinsic
androgenic
activity, probably because they to some extent bind
to the  xxxg183xxx  (431.
the present data suggest that hydrophobic
interactions play an important role in the interactions
of
steroids with the human glucocorticoid
receptor as
they do in the steroid-progesterone
receptor interactions [41]. thus, the introduction
of 17a-acetoxy
and 6ru-methyl groups to the progesterone
molecule
(table 1) resulted in an increase in the relative
binding affinity from 6.3 to 42% ( xxxd2554xxx ) or 46% ( xxxd2557xxx , bearing
an additional
double bond at the carbon 6). furthermore,
the methylation
of the progesterone
molecule at the positions
16 and 17 (4-pregnene16@,17-dimethyl-3,20-dione;
table 1) approximately
doubled the receptor binding affinity. in contrast,
the introduction
of polar (hydroxyl) substituents
to
the steroid molecule led to less pronounced
effects
on the relative binding affinity. thus, progesterone
derivatives
with
one
(17- xxxd2303xxx ,
deoxycorticosterone,
4-pregnene-lib-ol-3,20-dione)
or two (ll-deoxycortisol,
4-pregnene-11/3,17a-diol4-pregnene-11/?,21-diol-3,20-dione)
3,20-dione,
hydroxyl groups had relative binding affinities of
2.4-7.1%
(table 1). the simultaneous
presence of
three hydroxyl groups at the carbons 11, 17 and 21
(cortisol) increased the relative binding affinity up
to 25%.
we have also investigated
the influence of progesterone and some selected synthetic progestins in
vitro functions of human lymphocytes.
the synthetic
pregnane derivatives,
medroxyprogesterone
acetate
and  xxxd2557xxx 
acetate, were selected due to their
considerable
binding affinity towards the  xxxg1601xxx , while the synthetic 19nortestosterone derivatives,
 xxxd2751xxx 
and d- xxxd2754xxx ,
where chosen since they did apparently
not bind to
the glucocorticoid
receptor. all these model steroids
are known to bind avidly to the human progesterone
receptor and also to exert potent progestin activity
in viva [41]. dexamethasone
was used as a reference
steroid for the glucocorticoid
activity. four different
mitogens were selected to study the regulatory influence of progestins
to human lymphocytes
in vitro.
the t cell dependent
b lymphocyte
differentiation
induced by pwm has been regarded as a model of
the in vivo immune response [44]. cona and pha
are selective t cell mitogens [45] while protein acarrying
staph. aureus strain cowan i bacteria

binding of progestins to the  xxxg1601xxx 
directly activates b lymphocytes independently
of
t cells [46].
progesterone itself was found to display a general
suppressive activity on the lymphocyte functions,
whether tested with mitogens activating only t cells,
t + b cells or b cells. the synthetic progestins with
a pregnane-type structure showing affinity for the
glucocorticoid
receptors,
medroxyprogesterone
acetate and  xxxd2557xxx , gave a different
response pattern. while the dna synthesis of purified t cells stimulated with the t cell mitogens
cona and pha were very sensitive to the inhibitory
activity of these two steroids, the pwm response
activating both b cells and t cells was inhibited to
a lesser degree and the response induced by the b
cell mitogen, staph. aureus, was even slightly
enhanced (fig. 4). in addition, the pfc response of
the mononuclear cells after pwm stimulation in the
presence of 3 x 10-9-3 x lo-’ mol/l of  xxxd2554xxx  or  xxxd2557xxx  was significantly increased (fig. 5). this kind of dual activity
on the in vitro lymphocyte functions was similar to
that obtained with dexamethasone. in contrast, the
19-nortestosterone
derivatives,  xxxd2751xxx 
and
d- xxxd2754xxx , which did not show any significant binding affinity to the  xxxg1601xxx , were also
devoid of the enhancing effect of the pfc generation
induced by dexamethasone (fig. 5).
the mechanism by which medroxyprogesterone
acetate and  xxxd2557xxx  promote enhanced b
cell maturation (fig. 5) in vitro is still to be elucidated. however, as these steroids efficiently bind to
the  xxxg1601xxx  it is reasonable to assume
that this induction operates through molecular mechanisms similar to those of glucocorticoids. human
suppressor t cells have been reported to be especially
sensitive in vitro to the action of steroid hormones,
including glucocorticoids [4749] and estradiol [50].
thus, it is tempting to suggest that inhibition of the
suppressor cell activity by dexamethasone,  xxxd2554xxx  or  xxxd2557xxx  leads to
an enhanced b cell differentiation and an increased
generation of pfc.
x-irradiation with a dose of 1000 rad is known to
rather selectively inhibit the t suppressor cell activity
[51]. the enhancement of the pwm induced pfc
response obtained with dexamethasone,
 xxxd2554xxx  and  xxxd2557xxx  was not
seen when these steroids were added to cultures of
x-irradiated
cells. moreover,
the presence of
medroxyprogesterone
acetate did not induce significant enhancement of the pfc response induced
by the t-cell independent [45] mitogen staph. aureus
(fig. 5). these findings further support the concept
that the principal target for hormonal influence is a
radiosensitive (suppressor) t cell population.
under physiological conditions in man the prevailing progesterone concentrations are not likely to
reach such levels as to permit an effective competition with cortisol for  xxxg1601xxx  sites
to occur, with the possible exception of pregnancy.
progesterone, present in very high concentrations
at the maternal-fetal interphase, has been proposed
to constitute a physiological locally-acting immunosuppressant
to prevent fetal rejection
[52],
although there is no direct evidence that this would

1517

receptor-mediated
occur via a glucocorticoid
mechanism.
we believe, however, that during pharmacological
interventions
the cross-reactions demonstrated in
this study may reach clinical significance. high doses
of medroxyprogesterone
acetate have been reported
to impair glucose tolerance in diabetics [53], depress
growth hormone release induced by hypoglycemia
[54] and strongly suppress the function of the
pituitary-adrenal
axis [55]. medroxyprogesterone
acetate alone also maintains
adrenalectomized
patients without signs of hypocortisolism [56] and
shows immunosuppressive
activity in dogs [14]. in
view of the occurrence of glucocorticoid receptors
in uterine tissue [57] even the possibility remains
that a part of the antineoplastic effect of  xxxd2554xxx  in endometrial cancer [58] is
mediated via the  xxxg1601xxx  instead of
the  xxxg1737xxx . to our knowledge, there
is no data to indicate that progestins of the 19nortestosterone
would
possess
type
any
glucocorticoid-like
in vivo activity in the human
being.
