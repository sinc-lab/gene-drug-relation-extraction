dual egfr/erbb2 inhibition is an attractive therapeutic
strategy for epithelial tumors, as ligand-induced erbb2/
egfr heterodimerization triggers potent proliferative
and survival signals. here we show that a small
molecule,  xxxd2445xxx , potently inhibits both egfr and
erbb2 tyrosine kinases leading to growth arrest and/or
apoptosis in egfr and erbb2-dependent tumor cell
lines.  xxxd2445xxx  markedly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of egfr and erbb2, and inhibited activation of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 and akt, downstream effectors of proliferation
and cell survival, respectively. complete inhibition of
activated akt in erbb2 overexpressing cells correlated
with a 23-fold increase in apoptosis compared with
vehicle controls. egf, often elevated in cancer patients,
did not reverse the inhibitory effects of  xxxd2445xxx .
these observations were reproduced in vivo, where
 xxxd2445xxx  treatment inhibited activation of egfr,
erbb2,  xxxg1369xxx /2 and akt in human tumor xenografts.
 xxxg1369xxx /2 and akt represent potential biomarkers to
assess the clinical activity of  xxxd2445xxx . inhibition of
activated akt in egfr or erbb2-dependent tumors by
 xxxd2445xxx  may lead to tumor regressions when used as
a monotherapy, or may enhance the anti-tumor activity
of chemotherapeutics, since constitutive activation of
akt has been linked to chemo-resistance.

introduction
the  xxxg682xxx  family of type i receptor tyrosine kinases
( xxxg682xxx  or the  xxxg682xxx -egfr,
erbb2,  xxxg722xxx , and  xxxg723xxx ) are widely expressed in
epithelial, mesenchymal, and neuronal tissues where

they play a pivotal role in regulating cell proliferation,
survival, and differentiation (sibilia and wagner, 1995;
threadgill et al., 1995). overexpression of wild-type
erbb2 or egfr, or expression of constitutively
activated receptor mutants, transforms cells in vitro
(di fiore et al., 1987; dimarco et al., 1989; hudziak et
al., 1987; qian et al., 1995), and correlates with a
poorer clinical outcome in some breast cancers and a
variety of other malignancies (slamon et al., 1987,
1989; bacus et al., 1994). consequently, considerable
attention has focused on developing therapeutically
active monoclonal antibodies (mab) or small molecule
kinase inhibitors that target either receptor.
a family of peptide ligands regulates  xxxg682xxx  receptor
signaling, and includes  xxxg681xxx  (egf)
and transforming growth factor a (tgf-a) which both
bind to egfr (reise and stern, 1998; salomon et al.,
1995). ligand binding induces  xxxg682xxx  receptor homoand heterodimerization, which in turn leads to receptor
autophosphorylation and activation. erbb2 is the
preferred heterodimeric partner for egfr,  xxxg722xxx ,
and  xxxg723xxx  (graus-porta et al., 1997; tzahar et al.,
1996). although a number of soluble ligands have been
identified for these three receptors, none has been
identified for erbb2, which seems to be transactivated
following heterodimerization (ullrich and schlessinger,
1990; wada et al., 1990; karunagaran et al., 1996;
stern and kamps, 1988).
with the exception of  xxxg722xxx , all  xxxg682xxx  receptor family
members share a highly conserved cytoplasmic tyrosine
kinase domain. autophosphorylation of specific cytoplasmic tyrosine residues establishes binding sites for
src-homology 2 (sh2) and  xxxd1075xxx -bindingdomain containing proteins that in turn link to
downstream effectors involved in cell proliferation
(mitogen-activated protein kinases or mapk; also
known as  xxxg1369xxx /2) and survival (phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase/akt) pathways (olayioye et al., 1998;
luttrell et al., 1994; levkowitz et al., 1996; klapper
et al., 2000; egan and weinberg, 1993; kavanaugh and
williams, 1994; daly, 1999).
much attention has focused on the significance of
egfr or erbb2 overexpression in tumor physiology.
however, increased expression of egf or tgf-a is a

poor prognostic indicator in some cancer patients
(grandis et al., 1998; albanell et al., 2001), and locally
increased concentrations of egf or other ligands in
the tumor microenvironment appear to be responsible
for maintaining heterodimers in an activated state even
in the absence of receptor overexpression (albanell et
al., 2001; howell et al., 1998; jiang et al., 1998). thus,
it is important to develop therapeutic strategies that are
not solely dependent upon receptor overexpression for
their anti-tumor activity.
herceptin, a humanized anti-erbb2 monoclonal
antibody has been approved for the treatment of the
minority of breast cancers that either overexpress
erbb2 or demonstrate erbb2 gene amplification
(cobleigh et al., 1999). similarly, several anti-egfr
targeted approaches are currently being investigated in
the clinic including  xxxd467xxx , a human-mouse chimeric
anti-egfr mab (goldstein et al., 1995; levitzki and
gazit, 1995; mendelsohn, 1997). because erbb2containing heterodimers elicit such potent mitogenic
signals, interrupting both erbb2 and egfr simultaneously is an appealing therapeutic strategy (earp et
al., 1995). recently, the combination of herceptin and
 xxxd467xxx  was shown to exhibit enhanced growth inhibition
in ovca 420 human ovarian carcinoma cells
compared with either mab alone (ye et al., 1999).
however, egf and  xxxd467xxx  have comparable binding
affinities for egfr, and egf was able to reverse the
growth inhibitory effects of combination herceptin and
 xxxd467xxx . this approach may therefore be problematic in
the clinic, where patients may already have increased
levels of egf receptor ligands (ye et al., 1999).
to circumvent this dilemma, a number of small
molecule, dual egfr-erbb2  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors
have recently been identified and their pre-clinical antitumor activities reported (fry et al., 1998; cockerill et
al., 2001; rusnak et al., 2001a,b). we now report that
 xxxd2445xxx , a reversible, dual  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor
of both egfr and erbb2, inhibits not only baseline
activation of both receptors, but also interrupts
downstream activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 map kinases and
akt. although  xxxg682xxx  inhibitors have been largely
associated with reversible growth inhibition (cytostasis), akt inhibition in  xxxd2445xxx  treated erbb2expressing cells was associated with significant apoptosis. we show that  xxxd2445xxx  inhibits signal
transduction in egf-stimulated tumor lines that do
not overexpress egfr, which has implications in the
clinic where egfr ligands appear to mediate tumor
progression despite the absence of egfr overexpression. importantly, exogenous egf did not reverse the
anti-tumor effects of  xxxd2445xxx .
to our knowledge, our study is one of the first in
which the in vivo effects of an  xxxg682xxx  inhibitor were
examined in the same tumor implant biopsied before
and after treatment in an attempt to minimize interanimal variability in baseline expression of activated
egfr and erbb2.  xxxd2445xxx  inhibits tumor xenograft
growth (rusnak et al., 2001b). here we elucidate its
mechanism of action by demonstrating that  xxxd2445xxx 
inhibits the activation of proliferation and survival
oncogene

pathways in both erbb2 and egfr-dependent tumors.
our data indicate that  xxxd2445xxx  is a potent dual
inhibitor of egfr and erbb2, leading to tumor
growth arrest and/or apoptosis even in the presence
of saturating concentrations of egf, thus supporting
its use in the clinic.

 xxxd2445xxx  inhibits erbb2 tyrosine phosphorylation and
downstream activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2
we examined the effects of  xxxd2445xxx  on the
activation-state of erbb2 and egfr, as well as
downstream proliferation and survival pathways using
s1 cells, which express high levels of phosphorylated
erbb2. s1 cells were established by single cell cloning of
hb4ac5.2 cells, a mammary epithelial line stably
transfected with erbb2 (harris et al., 1999).
 xxxd2445xxx  inhibition of erbb2 tyrosine phosphorylation (i.e. formation of p-tyr/erbb2) was dosedependent. partial inhibition was seen at 500 nm, with
complete inhibition at 2.5 mm after 72 h (figure 1).
erbb2 overexpression is associated with the activation of downstream pathways involved in the
propagation of proliferative signals such as  xxxg1369xxx /2
map kinases (janes et al., 1994). after 72 h exposure,
 xxxd2445xxx  inhibited activated, phosphorylated  xxxg1369xxx /2
(p-erk) by more than 50% at 500 nm and 2.5 mm, with
100% inhibition at 5 mm compared to vehicle treated
controls (figure 1). total steady state erk protein
remained unchanged. a similar dose-dependent relationship was observed in hn5 cells, a squamous cell
head and neck carcinoma line that overexpresses
egfr (data not shown).

erbb2 and egfr, respectively (ye et al., 1999). the
authors concluded that dual inhibition of egfr and
erbb2 would result in more effective anti-tumor
activity. since egf levels have been shown to be
elevated in cancer patients (grandis et al., 1998;
albanell et al., 2001), we next examined whether
egf would reverse  xxxd2445xxx  inhibition of activated
egfr, erbb2, and downstream effector molecules.
bt474 is an erbb2 overexpressing breast carcinoma
line that also expresses egfr, albeit at lower levels.
bt474 cells constitutively express activated erbb2 (ptyr/erbb2) (figure 2a). egf stimulation did not
significantly increase steady state levels of p-tyr/erbb2,
consistent with this receptor being maximally activated
in these cells at baseline (lane et al., 2000). although
egfr is constitutively expressed at only low levels in
bt474 cells, stimulation with egf increased p- xxxg1369xxx /2
levels indicating that egfr signaling was functional.
exposure to 1 mm  xxxd2445xxx  for 24 h inhibited egf
stimulation of p- xxxg1369xxx /2 (figure 2a).  xxxd2445xxx  also
inhibited baseline levels of p-tyr/erbb2, an effect not
reversed by egf.
erbb2 signaling also activates the pi3k/akt pathway, which plays an important role in regulating cell
survival (daly, 1999). constitutive activation of akt
has been implicated in tumor resistance to chemotherapeutic agents (thakkar et al., 2001; tenzer et al.,
2001; brognard et al., 2001). stimulation of bt474
cells with egf increased levels of activated, phosphorylated akt (p-akt, ser 473) approximately
twofold over baseline (figure 2a). in contrast,
 xxxd2445xxx  treatment completely inhibited p-akt.
exogenous egf did not reverse inhibition.
the effects of  xxxd2445xxx  were examined in hn5
carcinoma cells, which overexpress egfr (figure 2b).
egfr phosphorylation increased in response to 50 ng/
ml egf. treating cells with 5 mm  xxxd2445xxx  not only
inhibited baseline levels of p-tyr/egfr, but also
blocked the stimulatory effect of egf on p-tyr/
egfr. as in erbb2 overexpressing cells,  xxxd2445xxx 
treatment also inhibited downstream p- xxxg1369xxx /2 in hn5
cells. simultaneous administration of egf did not
reverse these inhibitory effects. although  xxxd2445xxx 
treatment inhibited p-akt in hn5 cells, the effect was
smaller than in erbb2-overexpressing tumor cells.
erbb2 overexpressing cells undergo apoptosis in response
to  xxxd2445xxx 
the effects of  xxxd2445xxx  on cell survival were assessed
in exponentially growing s1 cells (figure 3). the subg1 apoptotic fraction comprised 2% of vehicle-treated
s1 cells. the percentage of apoptotic cells increased 23fold to 46% after 72 h exposure to  xxxd2445xxx , with a
concomitant reduction in the percentage of cells in s
phase and g2/m. a similar result was observed in
bt474 cells (rusnak et al., 2001b). although growth
arrested, we did not see significant apoptosis of
 xxxd2445xxx  treated hn5 cells (data not shown),
consistent with previous observations (rusnak et al.,
2001b).

were cultured in the presence or absence of  xxxd2445xxx  (1 mm for
bt474; 5 mm for hn5) in serum-free medium for 24 h. egf
(50 ng/ml) was added to cell cultures as indicated. equal amounts
of protein were used to assess activated erbb2 (p-tyr/erbb2) in
bt474 cells, activated egfr (p-tyr/egfr) in hn5 cells and

analysis was performed using  xxxd3027xxx  iodide staining and flow

exact mechanism by which herceptin exerts its antitumor activity is unclear. we compared the effects of
 xxxd2445xxx  with herceptin on p- xxxg1369xxx /2 in both bt474
and hn5 cells (figure 4), using treatment conditions
for herceptin previously shown to inhibit the growth
of erbb2 overexpressing cells (lane et al., 2000). at
72 h, herceptin had very little effect on p- xxxg1369xxx /2 levels
compared with untreated controls in either cell line,
while  xxxd2445xxx  at 500 nm or 1 mm inhibited p- xxxg1369xxx /2
in both bt474 and hn5 cells. neither herceptin nor
 xxxd2445xxx  reduced total  xxxg1369xxx /2 steady state protein
levels.

hb4a is a mammary epithelial line that expresses low
levels of both erbb2 and egfr (harris et al., 1999).
steady state p-tyr/egfr levels increased in response
to egf stimulation (figure 5) indicated the integrity
of the egfr pathway.  xxxd2445xxx  not only reduced
baseline p-tyr/egfr levels in hb4a cells but also
blocked the stimulatory effects of egf on egfr
tyrosine phosphorylation (figure 5). similarly,
 xxxd2445xxx  reduced the baseline amount of p-tyr/
erbb2 and p-erk, effects not reversed by egf. after
72 h exposure to herceptin, there was relatively little
change in baseline levels of p-tyr/erbb2 or p-erk
levels, while total erbb2 steady state protein was
reduced (figure 5). concurrent treatment with
 xxxd2445xxx  and herceptin did not reduce levels of ptyr/erbb2 or p-erk below those observed following
treatment with  xxxd2445xxx  alone.
egf stimulated hb4a cell growth by 20% over
vehicle treated controls (figure 6), while treatment
with  xxxd2445xxx  (2.5 mm) inhibited cell growth 50%
compared with vehicle treated controls. importantly,
egf did not reverse  xxxd2445xxx  induced growth
inhibition.

the effects of  xxxd2445xxx  on the activation of egfr
and downstream pathways were examined in the hn5
human tumor xenograft. to simulate the clinical
setting where each patient serves as his or her own
control, we conducted experiments whereby each
animal served as its own control, taking biopsies from
the same tumor implant before and after treatment
with  xxxd2445xxx . as shown in figure 7a,  xxxd2445xxx 
treatment resulted in a dose-response effect, with very

we next examined the effects of  xxxd2445xxx 
treatment on erk and akt. there was little effect in
animals treated with vehicle alone or administered

10 mg/kg  xxxd2445xxx  (data not shown). however, at
30 mg/kg/dose,  xxxd2445xxx  inhibited p- xxxg1369xxx /2 and pakt in tumors without affecting total steady state
protein levels of either molecule (figure 7b). treatment
at 100 mg/kg/dose showed similar inhibition of p-erk
and p-akt (data not shown).
to highlight the dual inhibitory nature of

discussion
 xxxd2445xxx  is a potent reversible, dual inhibitor of the
 xxxg2198xxx  domains of both egfr and erbb2,
with ic50 values against purified egfr and erbb2 of
10.2 and 9.8 nm, respectively (rusnak et al., 2001b).
recent reports have demonstrated that  xxxd2445xxx 
inhibits egfr or erbb2 autophosphorylation in tumor
cell lines that overexpress either receptor (rusnak et
al., 2001b), an effect that was primarily associated with
tumor cell growth arrest. in the current study, we
investigated the effect of  xxxd2445xxx  on downstream
survival and proliferation pathways to help elucidate
its mechanism of action. we also studied whether or
not egf could reverse these effects. identifying a panel
of downstream effector molecules would be useful in
the clinical development of  xxxd2445xxx , by helping to
(i) identify in which clinical settings and patients
populations  xxxd2445xxx  would be most effective, and
(ii) identify a biologically effective dose, in place of the
traditional method based on maximally tolerated dose
as used for conventional cytotoxics.
most mitogenic signals transduced through growth
factor receptor activation ultimately converge on a
common downstream effector,  xxxg1369xxx /2 map kinase
(egan and weinberg, 1993). activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 serves as
a transcription factor regulating tumor cell proliferation and survival (pulverer et al., 1991). increased
expression of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 has been demonstrated
in a number of human malignancies (hoshino et al.,
1999; albanell et al., 2001), and overexpression of

and total  xxxg682xxx -2 steady state protein ( xxxg682xxx -2), total  xxxg1369xxx /2

erbb2 in tumor cell lines results in the upregulation of
activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 (janes et al., 1994). our data show
that  xxxd2445xxx  inhibits baseline  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation in
both egfr and erbb2-dependent tumor lines.
furthermore, although egf stimulated the expression
of activated p- xxxg1369xxx /2 in bt474 cells (which express
relatively low levels of egfr),  xxxd2445xxx  completely
inhibited these effects. these results highlight the
importance of ligand-induced growth effects regardless
of the levels of receptor expression. they also show
that  xxxg1369xxx /2 may be a useful downstream biomarker
correlating with the ability of  xxxd2445xxx  to inhibit
tumor progression.
 xxxg1369xxx /2 may not be a useful biomarker for all
 xxxg682xxx -targeted therapies. in contrast to  xxxd2445xxx ,
herceptin did not inhibit  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation in two
different erbb2 overexpressing cell lines. herceptin
did inhibit erbb2 phosphorylation, although less than
 xxxd2445xxx . despite its antiproliferative effects in
tumor cell lines, there have been contradictory
reports on the effects of herceptin on erbb2
phosphorylation state as well as downstream effectors
such as  xxxg1369xxx /2 map kinases (ye et al., 1999; lane
et al., 2000; scott et al., 1991). differences in cell
lines or the time point at which p- xxxg1369xxx /2 was
examined may explain these discrepancies.
the  xxxg1743xxx  kinase/akt pathway is involved in
protecting cells from apoptosis. in many tumors,
constitutive activation of akt has been implicated
as a mechanism of resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapies (thakkar et al., 2001; tenzer et al., 2001;
brognard et al., 2001). strategies designed to inhibit
akt activation could work by inducing tumor cell
apoptosis by themselves, or by sensitizing tumors to
the cytotoxic effects of concurrent chemotherapy. here
we show that  xxxd2445xxx  inhibits baseline phosphorylation of akt in erbb2 (s1) and egfr (hn5)
dependent tumor lines, an effect which was not
reversed by the presence of egf. the ability of
 xxxd2445xxx  to potently inhibit p-akt was associated
with a 23-fold increase in the percentage of s1 cells
undergoing apoptosis compared to vehicle treated
controls. in contrast, apoptosis increased only slightly
in hn5 cells (rusnak et al., 2001b). these findings
are consistent with recent reports indicating that the
 xxxg1743xxx  kinase/akt pathway appears to be more
dependent upon erbb2 signaling than egfr (tari
and lopez-berestein, 2000). since p-akt inhibition
was more pronounced in erbb2 overexpressing cells,
induction of apoptosis might in part be dependent
upon the degree to which p-akt is inhibited.
whether or not  xxxd2445xxx  alone induces apoptosis,
its ability to inhibit p-akt indicates that it may
synergize with cytotoxic agents or radiotherapy in
inducing tumor cell death.
our results in vitro were replicated in human tumor
xenografts. we attempted to minimize inter-animal
baseline differences in the levels of activated egfr,
 xxxg1369xxx /2 and akt by biopsying the same hn5 tumor
implant before and after treatment. this approach
most closely mimics the clinical setting where each

patient serves as his or her own control.  xxxd2445xxx 
inhibited receptor autophosphorylation, as well as
downstream p- xxxg1369xxx /2 and p-akt in tumor implants.
the dual inhibitory nature of  xxxd2445xxx  was demonstrated in bt474 xenografts where  xxxd2445xxx 
inhibited activated erbb2 as well as downstream perk1/2. the effects of  xxxd2445xxx  on activated erbb2
and egfr, as well as the activation of downstream
intermediaries correlate with previously reported
growth inhibition of both bt474 and hn5 xenografts
at the doses of  xxxd2445xxx  administered in the current
study (rusnak et al., 2001b).
these data provide strong support for the use of
 xxxd2445xxx  in a variety of tumors either overexpressing
egfr or erbb2, or with evidence of constitutively
activated egfr or erbb2. the effect of  xxxd2445xxx  on
survival pathways provides pre-clinical scientific
support for combining this compound with cytoreductive therapies.
the inability of egf to reverse the anti-tumor
effects of  xxxd2445xxx  at a molecular level and on the
proliferation of cells in vitro cannot be understated.
some tumors may not quantitatively overexpress
either erbb2 or egfr, while remaining dependent
upon these receptors for growth and survival signals.
even low levels of egfr may be activated in the
presence of ligands such as egf, followed by
formation of egfr/erbb2 heterodimers and erbb2
transactivation.  xxxd2445xxx  offers the distinct clinical
advantage of a potent, reversible dual inhibitor of
both erbb2 and egfr whose effects on pathways
involved in regulating tumor progression and survival
are not reversed in the presence of egf.

2-furyl]-4-quinazolinamine, was synthesized as previously
described (cockerill et al., 2001).  xxxd2445xxx  for cell culture
work was dissolved in dmso.
cell cultures
hn5 cells were cultured in dmem supplemented with high
glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs). hb4a cells grew
in rpmi 1640 supplemented with l-glutamine, 10% fbs
(hyclone), 10 mg/ml hydrocortisone, and 5 m/ml insulin.
bt474 cells were cultured under identical conditions to
hb4a, but without hydrocortisone. s1 cells were cultured in
rpmi 1640 supplemented with l-glutamine, 10% fbs and
50 mg/ml hygromycin. cell cultures were maintained in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% co2 at 378c.
egf stimulation experiments
cells were seeded at low density in serum free-medium
supplemented with 1.5% bsa, and then exposed for 24 h to
 xxxd2445xxx  at various concentrations as indicated in the
figure legends, or 10 mg/ml herceptin. cells were stimulated
with 50 ng/ml egf for 15 min, harvested on ice, and then
lysed in ripa buffer (150 mm nacl, 50 mm tris-hcl,
ph 7.5, 0.25% (w/v)  xxxd1835xxx , 1% np-40, 5 mm sodium
orthovanadate, 2 mm sodium fluoride, and a protease
inhibitor cocktail).
cell cycle analysis
cells were harvested and fixed with 70% ethanol in pbs. cell
pellets were then resuspended in 0.5 ml pbs containing
 xxxd3027xxx  iodide (50 mg/ml) and dnase-free rnase (100 mg/
ml). cell cycle analysis was performed using a bd flow
cytometer (becton dickinson, san jose, ca, usa).
immunoprecipitation and western blots

materials and methods
materials
the erbb2 overexpressing human breast adenocarcinoma cell
line, bt474, was obtained from the american type culture
collection (rockville, md, usa). the hb4a cell line is
derived from human mammary luminal tissue, and erbb2
transfection of hb4a yielded the cell line hb4a c5.2 (harris
et al., 1999). the s1 cell line was established by sub-cloning
hb4a c5.2, and was chosen for further studies as it expressed
high levels of phosphorylated erbb2 protein. the egfr
overexpressing licr-lon-hn5 head and neck carcinoma
cell line, hn5, was kindly provided by helmout modjtahedi
at the institute of cancer research, surrey, uk. egf was
purchased from sigma chemical (st. louis, mo, usa).
anti- xxxd1075xxx  antibody was purchased from sigma
chemical. anti-egfr (ab-12) and anti-c-erbb2 (ab-11)
antibodies were from neo markers (union city, ca, usa).
anti-phospho-akt (ser437) was from cell signaling
technology, inc. (beverly, ma, usa). anti-akt1/2, antiphospho- xxxg1369xxx /2, anti- xxxg1369xxx  and anti- xxxg1366xxx  antibodies were
purchased from santa cruz biotechnology, inc. (santa cruz,
ca, usa). herceptin was purchased from genentech, inc.
(south san francisco, ca, usa). supersignal west femto
maximum sensitivity substrate was from pierce (rockford,
il, usa). protein g agarose was purchased from boehringer
mannheim (germany).  xxxd2445xxx , n-{3-chloro-4-[(3-fluorobenzyl)oxy]phenyl}-6-[5-({[2-(methylsulfonyl)ethyl]amino}methyl)-

whole cell extracts were prepared by scraping cells off petri
dishes, washing the cell pellet twice in phosphate buffered
saline (pbs), and then resuspending the pellet in two-packedcell volumes of ripa buffer. protein concentrations were
determined using a modification of the bradford method
(bio-rad laboratory). steady state levels of total erbb2 and
egfr protein, as well activated erbb2 and egfr were
assessed by immunoprecipitation (ip) and western blot. for
ip western blots, equivalent amounts of protein were
precleared with protein g plus/protein a agarose overnight
at 48c. precleared lysates were then incubated overnight at
48c with specific antibodies. immune complexes were
precipitated with protein g plus/protein a agarose beads,
washed in ripa buffer and then boiled in sample loading
buffer. steady state levels of total  xxxg1369xxx /2 and activated  xxxg1369xxx /
2 (p-erk) as well as total akt protein and activated akt
(p-akt) protein were assessed by western blot. for western
blot, equal amounts of proteins or immunoprecipitated target
proteins were resolved by either 7.5% or 4 – 15% gradient
sds polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing
conditions. proteins were transferred to immobilon-p or
nitrocellulose membranes. efficiency and equal loading of
proteins were evaluated by ponceau s staining. membranes
were blocked for 1 h in tbs (25 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4,
150 mm nacl, 2.7 mm kcl) containing 4% (w/v) lowfat milk
or 3% bsa (w/v). membranes were then probed with specific
antibodies recognizing target proteins. proteins were visualized with the supersignal west femto maximum sensitivity
substrate kit (pierce).

tumor xenografts
hn5 cells were grown in dmem supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, sodium pyruvate and l-glutamine at 378c
in a 95/5% air/co2 atmosphere. cells grown in vitro were
harvested in log phase and resuspended in pbs/matrigel
(1 : 1). cells (26106/mouse) in 0.2 ml were injected into the
right flank of cd-1 nude mice. female cd-1 nude mice were
acquired from charles river laboratories. mice were
maintained in filter-topped cages in an aseptic environment
with laminar flow filtered ventilation. once tumor implants
were palpable, mice were administered orally either vehicle
(0.5% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose/0.1% tween 80) alone
or five doses of  xxxd2445xxx   xxxd1891xxx , 30, or 100 mg/kg given
twice daily at 6 h intervals. tumors were biopsied pretreatment and 4 h after the last dose. all animal surgery was
conducted under aseptic conditions. for the initial biopsy,
mice were anesthetized with isofluorane inhalation. the skin
over the tumor was disinfected with iodine. a small hemostat
was used to tease away the skin from the tumor, and scissors
were used to make a 1 cm incision over the tumor. a scalpel
and forceps were used to remove approximately 100 mg of
tumor. the tumor was then frozen in liquid nitrogen. wound

clips were used to close the incision. the anesthetized mice
were kept warm until they recovered mobility, usually less
than 1 – 2 min. for the terminal biopsy, mice were euthanized
with co2 inhalation, and the remainder of the tumor excised
and frozen in liquid nitrogen. cell extracts were prepared by
homogenization in ripa buffer at 48c.
bt474 tumors are maintained by serial passage of
fragments into female c.b-17 scid mice, for up to 10
passages. when tumor implants become palpable, mice were
administered either vehicle (0.5% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose/0.1% tween 80) alone or five doses of  xxxd2445xxx  at
100 mg/kg given twice daily at 12 h intervals by oral gavage.
bt474 tumors were removed after the fifth dose of
 xxxd2445xxx  after mice were euthanized with co2 inhalation.
cell extracts were prepared by homogenization as described
for hn5 xenografts.
