 xxxd2834xxx  ( xxxd2834xxx ): a second-generation  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonist for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting
andrew de leon, rph

in july 2003, the food and drug administration approved  xxxd2834xxx 
hydrochloride injection for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (cinv). the newest agent in the class of  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonists (5-ht3ras),  xxxd2834xxx  differs from other agents in its
class by its higher receptor-binding affinity and longer half-life. these
pharmacological properties have resulted in improved antiemetic activity
in clinical trials, particularly in the treatment of delayed cinv following
moderate emetogenic chemotherapy. based on the results of these clinical studies,  xxxd2834xxx  is the only 5-ht3ra approved for delayed cinv.
 xxxd2834xxx  is given as a single 0.25-mg intravenous dose 30 minutes
before the initial dose of chemotherapy. headache and constipation were
the most common adverse events reported with  xxxd2834xxx  therapy.

c

hemotherapeutic agents trigger the process of emesis
through activation of multiple neurotransmitter receptors in the vomiting center of the brain, chemoreceptor
trigger zone, and gastrointestinal tract (1). pharmacological treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting
(cinv) has focused on blocking these receptors using agents
such as antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine), phenothiazines
(e.g., promethazine,  xxxd3018xxx ), benzodiazepines (e.g.,
lorazepam), and corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone, methylprednisolone).
significant strides were made in the 1990s for the treatment of cinv with the advent of selective  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonists (5-ht3ras). chemotherapeutic agents release
serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine; this released serotonin is free to activate 5-ht3 receptors
located on peripheral vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the
chemoreceptor trigger zone, resulting in the initiation of the
vomiting reflex.
even with several drugs in the 5-ht3ra class available, the
incidence of acute and delayed cinv remains high. grunberg
and colleagues studied patients who were treated according to
current antiemetic guidelines after receiving moderate emetogenic chemotherapy (mec) to highly emetogenic chemotherapy (hec). almost all patients (97%) received a 5-ht3ra,
and 78% also received a corticosteroid. two or more antiemetics
were given to 80% of patients. treatment was generally given
during both acute- and delayed-risk phases of nausea and vomproc (bayl univ med cent) 2006;19:413–416

iting. during the acute phase (<24 hours after the first dose
of chemotherapy), 35% of patients experienced acute nausea
and 13% of patients experienced acute vomiting. during the
delayed phase (>24 hours after the first dose of chemotherapy),
60% of patients receiving hec experienced nausea and 50%
experienced vomiting, while 52% of patients receiving mec
experienced nausea and 38% experienced vomiting (2). nausea
and vomiting, particularly in the delayed phase, continue to be
significant problems for patients receiving chemotherapy.
 xxxd2834xxx , the newest agent in the 5-ht3ra class of
drugs, has a strong binding affinity to 5-ht3 receptors and
thus selectively blocks serotonin from binding to these receptors peripherally and centrally. it has little or no affinity for
other receptors.  xxxd2834xxx  is indicated for the prevention of
acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial
and repeat courses of moderate to highly emetogenic cancer
chemotherapy.
pharmacokinetics
compared with earlier 5-ht3ras,  xxxd2834xxx  has unique
pharmacokinetic properties. after administration in healthy
subjects and cancer patients, slow elimination from the body
occurs after an initial decline in plasma levels.  xxxd2834xxx  has
a volume of distribution of approximately 8.3 ± 2.5 l/kg, with
approximately 62% bound to plasma proteins. approximately
50% of  xxxd2834xxx  is metabolized into two inactive metabolites that exhibit <1% of the 5-ht3ra activity.  xxxd2834xxx  is
metabolized via the cyp2d6 enzyme pathway and to a lesser
extent,  xxxg590xxx  and cyp1a2 enzyme pathways. after a single
intravenous dose, approximately 40% is excreted as unchanged
drug in the urine after 144 hours. total body clearance of  xxxd2834xxx  was 160 ± 35 ml/h/kg, and renal clearance was 66.5 ±
18.2 ml/h/kg in healthy subjects. when compared with other
agents in the class,  xxxd2834xxx  exhibits a longer half-life (40
hours) and has a greater  xxxg1116xxx  binding affinity (3).

clinical trials
three trials were conducted to compare the efficacy of  xxxd2834xxx  with that of other 5-ht3ra agents. two studies evaluated  xxxd2834xxx  use prior to mec, and one study evaluated
 xxxd2834xxx  use prior to hec.
study 1
gralla and colleagues conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, stratified study of 570 adult patients that
received either a single intravenous dose of  xxxd2834xxx  0.25
mg,  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg, or ondansetron 32 mg 30 minutes
before administration of mec (4). the primary endpoint was
complete response (cr) established as the proportion of patients without emetic episodes and rescue medication during the
acute phase (<24 hours after the initial dose of chemotherapy).
secondary endpoints included efficacy of treatment of delayed
phase (>24 hours but <120 hours after the initial dose of chemotherapy) and overall cr (0 to 120 hours after the initial
dose of chemotherapy). compared with ondansetron 32 mg,
 xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg achieved significantly higher cr rates
(81% vs 68.6%, respectively; p < 0.01) during the acute phase.
statistically significant results were also observed in delayedphase cr (74.1% vs 55.1%, p < 0.001) and overall cr (69.3%
vs 50.3%, p < 0.001).  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg did not demonstrate a statistically significant advantage in efficacy compared
with  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg. based on the results, the authors
concluded that a single intravenous dose of  xxxd2834xxx  0.25
mg was superior to a single intravenous dose of ondansetron
32 mg in the prevention of acute and delayed cinv after administration of mec.
study 2
a study conducted by eisenberg and colleagues (5) comparing  xxxd2834xxx  with  xxxd1924xxx  revealed similar results. the
study included 569 patients in an intent-to-treat, multicenter,
randomized, double-blind, parallel, stratified, comparative trial
evaluating efficacy after administration of mec. each patient
was randomized to receive a single dose of  xxxd2834xxx  0.25
mg,  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg, or  xxxd1924xxx  100 mg intravenously
30 minutes before the administration of chemotherapy. the established endpoints were cr during the acute phase (<24 hours)
and delayed phase (24 to 120 hours) of nausea and vomiting
and overall cr (0 to 120 hours). compared with  xxxd1924xxx 
100 mg,  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg achieved higher cr rates in the
acute phase (63% vs 52.9%, p = 0.049), delayed phase (54%
vs 38.7%, p = 0.004), and overall (46% vs 34%, p = 0.021).
the higher cr rates for  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg were not statistically significant in the acute phase (57.1%, p = 0.412) but were
statistically significant in the delayed phase (56.6%, p < 0.001)
and overall (47.1%, p = 0.012). the authors concluded that a
single intravenous dose of  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg prior to mec
was as effective as a single intravenous dose of  xxxd1924xxx  100
mg for the prevention of acute cinv but was more effective
in preventing delayed cinv.

study 3
a third trial conducted by aapro and colleagues (6) evaluated the efficacy of  xxxd2834xxx  and ondansetron combined
with a corticosteroid prior to hec. the study included 447
patients in a randomized, double-blind, parallel, comparative
trial. each patient received a single dose of either  xxxd2834xxx 
0.25 mg or ondansetron 32 mg intravenously, with 67% of patients also receiving corticosteroids in each study group. primary
endpoints were cr during both the acute phase and overall.
the difference in cr between  xxxd2834xxx  and ondansetron
during the acute phase was not statistically significant (64.7% vs
55.8%); however,  xxxd2834xxx  was significantly better (40.7%
vs 25.2%, 97.5% ci) when overall cr was evaluated. the authors concluded that a single intravenous dose of  xxxd2834xxx 
0.25 mg prior to hec was as effective as a single intravenous
dose of ondansetron 32 mg in preventing acute cinv and more
effective in preventing delayed cinv.
position of  xxxd2834xxx  in clinical guidelines
recommendations for antiemetic therapy in patients receiving chemotherapy are outlined both by the american society of
clinical oncology (asco) and the national comprehensive
cancer network (nccn) in their respective 2006 guideline
updates. many clinical studies comparing all commercially available 5-ht3ras have been conducted using various routes, dosing ranges, and dosing schedules (7–9). both the nccn and
asco agree that studies have demonstrated that all 5-ht3ras
are equally efficacious in equivalent doses in preventing acute
cinv with minimal adverse events and recommend the use
of a 5-ht3ra, corticosteroids, and/or  xxxd203xxx  for prevention of acute emesis with mec and hec (10, 11). a specific
combination of agents is further defined with respect to the
emetic risk category of the antiemetic therapy.
neither set of recommendations selected a 5-ht3ra as a
preferred agent, although differences in the pharmacology and
pharmacokinetic parameters of the agents do exist. because
 xxxd2834xxx  exhibits significantly different pharmacodynamics than the other 5-ht3ras and is the only 5-ht3ra approved for delayed cinv, the nccn suggests the use of a
single dose of  xxxd2834xxx  for 3-day chemotherapy regimens
instead of daily oral or intravenous 5-ht3ras. the use of daily
or more frequent dosing of  xxxd2834xxx  in longer multipleday chemotherapy regimens has not been established and is
not recommended despite  xxxd2834xxx ’s safety profile at high
doses. asco recognizes that  xxxd2834xxx  outperformed other
5-ht3ras in comparative studies; however, the primary endpoints only established noninferiority. the lack of relevant studies to test the superiority of  xxxd2834xxx  combined with other
agents as standard of care in treating cinv has led asco to
suggest that  xxxd2834xxx  is only equally efficacious to other
5-ht3ras in equivalent doses.
contraindications, warnings, and precautions
 xxxd2834xxx  is contraindicated in patients with a known
hypersensitivity to the compound or any of its components.
 xxxd2834xxx  should be administered with caution in patients

who have or may develop prolongation of cardiac conduction
intervals, particularly qtc. such patients include those with
hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, patients taking diuretics with
the potential for inducing electrolyte abnormalities, patients
with congenital qt syndrome, patients taking antiarrhythmic
drugs or other drugs that lead to qt prolongation, and patients
receiving cumulative high-dose anthracycline therapy (12).
there are no adequate, well-controlled studies of the use of
 xxxd2834xxx  in pregnant women; however, teratology studies
performed in rats given oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day have not
revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus.
although the dose tested in rats represents 1894 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area,
animal studies are not always predictive of human response.
therefore,  xxxd2834xxx  should be used during pregnancy only
if clearly needed.  xxxd2834xxx  is designated as a category b
agent.
adverse events
the most commonly reported adverse reactions with the
use of  xxxd2834xxx  were headache and constipation. table 1
compares adverse reactions reported by ≥2% of patients during
clinical trials with  xxxd2834xxx , ondansetron, and  xxxd1924xxx .
adverse reactions were similar in severity and frequency with
all three drugs.
drug interactions
 xxxd2834xxx  has only a minor effect on the cytochrome
p450 pathway. no drug interactions have been reported related
to enzyme induction or inhibition; however, concurrent use of
apomorphine may result in profound hypotension and altered
consciousness and is contraindicated (13).
dosing and administration
the manufacturer-recommended dosage is 0.25 mg administered intravenously as a single dose over 30 seconds approximately 30 minutes prior to the administration of chemotherapy
on day 1 of each cycle. doses should not be given more than
once weekly due to a lack of studies evaluating the safety and
efficacy of repeat multiple dosing of  xxxd2834xxx . a recomoctober 2006

‡cost reflects one-time dose only since multiple doses of  xxxd2834xxx  have

mended intravenous dose for pediatric patients has not been established. no dosage adjustment is needed for geriatric patients
or for patients with renal or hepatic impairment (14).
 xxxd2834xxx  hydrochloride injection is currently available
as a solution in a single-use 5 ml vial containing 0.25 mg (0.05
mg/ml). an oral formulation of  xxxd2834xxx  is currently in
phase iii trials and if approved for marketing will provide health
care professionals an option of intravenous or oral administration to patients.
pharmacoeconomics
due to the increasing cost of care for cancer patients, costeffectiveness continues to be a major concern when choosing
therapeutic agents. proper dosage, length of therapy based on
multiple-day chemotherapy regimens, the emetic potential of
the chemotherapeutic agents, and patient history of response
to 5-ht3ras with previous cycles of chemotherapy are important factors to consider when choosing agents within the
class. however, because national guidelines have established all
5-ht3ras to be equally effective for the prevention of cinv,
the acquisition cost by the institution becomes the driving force
for which agent will become the preferred formulary 5-ht3ra.
table 2 provides a cost comparison based on average daily dose
of all 5-ht3ras.
conclusions
clinical studies clearly establish that  xxxd2834xxx  is as effective as other 5-ht3ras in the prevention of acute cinv and
is more effective in the prevention of delayed cinv. however,
with the importance of minimizing the cost of cancer treatment, more studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of
 xxxd2834xxx  compared with other 5-ht3ras using standard of
care combination therapy with corticosteroids and  xxxd203xxx .
further studies are needed as well to evaluate the use of  xxxd2834xxx  in multiple-day chemotherapy regimens. until these
data become available, health care systems will continue to use
the most cost-effective 5-ht3ra for their oncology patients and
may reserve  xxxd2834xxx  use for patients who are refractory to
less expensive agents in the class.
