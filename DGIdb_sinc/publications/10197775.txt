abstract––recently, we have reported that  xxxd3166xxx  activates ca2+ channels in neuronal
cells independently of its cofactor activities. several reports indicate that depolarization-induced
activation of ca2+ channels enhances neuronal survival. here, we investigated the effects of 6rtetrahydrobiopterin on survival of differentiated pc12 cells. depletion of serum and  xxxg1564xxx 
caused cell death, which was prevented by high potassium.  xxxd3166xxx  also prevented death
of pc12 cells cultured without serum and  xxxg1564xxx  in a dose-related manner at physiological
concentrations (1–100 µm). however, surviving cells cultured with  xxxd3166xxx  showed
undifferentiated form. 6s-tetrahydrobiopterin, a diastereoisomer of  xxxd3166xxx , also had a
cell-surviving effect, but it was less potent as compared with that of  xxxd3166xxx . the
cell-surviving effect of  xxxd3166xxx  was eliminated by a ca2+ channel blocker, but persisted
in the presence of an inhibitor for  xxxg2276xxx , dopamine, -dopa, an inhibitor for nitric
oxide synthase and a  xxxd2738xxx  generator. the effect of  xxxd3166xxx  was mimicked by
a cyclic-amp analogue and inhibited by an inhibitor for  xxxg1836xxx . ca2+ channel activity
was preserved but dopamine-releasing activity was disturbed in surviving cells cultured with 6rtetrahydrobiopterin.  xxxd3166xxx  had no effect on mitogen-activated protein kinase.
these findings suggest that, independently of its cofactor activities and mitogen-activated protein kinase
cascade,  xxxd3166xxx  enhances survival of pc12 cells by activating ca2+ channels via the
cyclic-amp– xxxg1836xxx  pathway, but that  xxxd3166xxx  does not preserve neuronal
character induced by  xxxg1564xxx .  1998 ibro. published by elsevier science ltd.

 xxxd3166xxx  ( xxxd3166xxx ) is a natural
cofactor for hydroxylases of tyrosine,34 phenylalanine18 and tryptophan.31  xxxd3166xxx  is also a cofactor for the family of  xxxd2738xxx  synthases
(noss).26  xxxd3166xxx  is contained in macrophages and
lymphocytes, and the synthesis of  xxxd3166xxx  is stimulated when these cells are activated,39,49,52 suggesting
that  xxxd3166xxx  is involved in cellular immunity, possibly via the action of  xxxd2738xxx  (no).  xxxd3166xxx 
enhances proliferation of erythroid cells44 and pc12
cells.1 we have reported that  xxxd3166xxx  stimulates
dopamine release22–24 and ca2+ channel activities41

in rat neuronal cells independently of its cofactor
activity. these findings indicate that, in addition to
its cofactor activities,  xxxd3166xxx  has diverse physiological functions in various kinds of cells.
several lines of evidence suggest that survival of
neuronal cells is enhanced by depolarizing stimulation.12,13,28,47 recently, it has been observed that
survival of  xxxg1564xxx  (ngf)-deprived sympathetic neuronal cells is enhanced by elevation of
intracellular ca2+ concentration, which is caused
by depolarization-induced activation of ca2+
channels.6,10,20,21 these findings suggest that survival
of neuronal cells is controlled by endogenous activators for ca2+ channels under physiological conditions. this appears to be inconsistent with reports
that an increase in intracellular ca2+ concentration
induced by activation of an n-methyl--aspartate
receptor causes neuronal cell death under ischaemia.33,43 the apparent discrepancy between these
two findings can be explained by the fact that the
intracellular ca2+ concentration induced by activation of n-methyl--aspartate receptors under
ischaemia is markedly higher than that induced by
activation of voltage-gated ca2+ channels under
physiological conditions.46 since  xxxd3166xxx  is observed
to activate ca2+ channels,41 we examined, in the

experimental procedures

drugs
 xxxd3166xxx ·2hcl
and
6s-tetrahydrobiopterin
(6sbh4)·2hcl were generous gifts from suntory biomedical
research center (osaka, japan).  xxxd2718xxx  was purchased from yamanouchi pharmaceutical co. (tokyo,
japan). rp-adenosine-3 ,5 -cyclic monophosphorothioate
(rp-camps) and mouse ngf (7.0s) were purchased from
funakoshi (tokyo, japan). á-methyl- xxxd3459xxx  (á-mt),
-nitro-arginine methyl ester (-name), -dopa,
dopamine and 8-bromo-cyclic-amp (8-br-camp) sodium
salt were purchased from sigma chemical co. (st louis,
mo, u.s.a.). noc-5 [3-[2-hydroxy-1-(1-methylethyl)-2nitrosohydrazine]-1-propanamine] was purchased from
dojindo laboratories (kumamoto, japan). 45ca2+ was
purchased from new england nuclear research
product (boston, ma, u.s.a.). mitogen-activated protein
(map) kinase enzyme assay kit and [ã-32p]atp were purchased from amersham life science (buckinghamshire,
u.k.). all other chemicals were of the purest grade available from regular commercial sources.
cell culture
pc12 cells were obtained from riken cell bank
(tsukuba, japan), maintained and subcultured in
dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium supplemented with
10% fetal calf serum, 10% horse serum, 4 mm glutamine,
500 units/ml penicillin and 500 mg/ml streptomycin. pc12
cells were plated on 96-well plates (icn biomedicals,
aurora, oh, u.s.a.) for 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay or poly--lysine-coated
six-well plates (sumitomo bakelite, tokyo, japan) for
45
ca2+ uptake, dopamine release and map kinase activity
assay. the cells were differentiated by administration of
ngf at 100 ng/ml to the culture medium supplemented
with 2% fetal calf serum and 2% horse serum at 48-h
intervals. after five- to seven-day culture for differentiation,
cells were used for experiments.
3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
assay
after five-day culture with drugs which were added to the
culture medium every 48 h, viable cell numbers were
measured with mtt assay, which is based on the cellular
conversion of a tetrazolium salt into an insoluble purple
formazan product in living cells.15 in brief, pc12 cells,
cultured with 100 µl of the medium in 96-well culture plates,
were incubated with 25 µl of 5 mg/ml mtt solution at 37c
for 2–4 h. then, 100 µl of solubilization solution made up
of 50%  xxxd1898xxx , 0.2 g/ml sodium dodecyl
sulphate, 2% glacial acetic acid and 25 mm hcl (ph 4.7)
was added to the culture wells and incubated at 37c
overnight. the absorbance was then measured using
a microplate reader. the specific optical density
(äod550620) was obtained by subtracting optical density
(od) at 620 nm from od at 550 nm.
45

ca2+ uptake

the cells were washed twice with krebs–hepes buffer
(mm: nacl 140, kcl 4.7, cacl2 1.0, mgcl2 1.2, kh2po4
1.2, glucose 11, hepes 5; ph 7.4) and incubated with 1 ml
krebs–hepes buffer at 37c for 10 min for equilibrium.
then, the incubation medium was replaced by krebs–
hepes buffer containing 45ca2+ (3 µci/ml) and test drugs,

and the cells were incubated at 37c for indicated times for
45
ca2+ uptake into the cells. in high-k+ krebs–hepes
buffer, nacl was reduced to 94.7 mm to adjust the osmolarity. after the incubation for 45ca2+ uptake, the medium
was rapidly removed by aspiration and the cells were
washed four times with ca2+-free krebs–hepes buffer
containing 2 mm lacl3 and 2 mm egta. the cells were
then mixed with 1 ml of 1% triton x-100 and kept for
30 min. finally, the radioactivity of 0.5 ml of the solubilized
cellular material was counted with a scintillation counter.
test drugs were dissolved immediately before use. inhibitors for  xxxg2276xxx  (á-mt), nos (-name),
ca2+ channels ( xxxd2718xxx ) and  xxxg1836xxx  (rpcamps) were added to the buffer during the preincubation period and the subsequent 45ca2+ uptake period.
other drugs were added to the medium during the 45ca2+
uptake period alone. 45ca2+ uptake into the cells was
expressed as nmol 45ca2+/mg protein.
dopamine release
after five-day culture under various conditions,
dopamine release was examined.29 the cells were washed
twice with krebs–hepes buffer and incubated with the
same buffer at 37c for 10 min for equilibrium. the buffer
was then replaced by 1 ml of krebs–hepes buffer containing 1 mm edta, 1 mm ascorbate and high (50 mm) or
normal (4.7 mm) kcl, and the cells were incubated at 37c
for 10 min. in high-k+ krebs–hepes buffer, nacl was
reduced to 94.7 mm to adjust the osmolarity. at the end of
the incubation, 0.5 ml of the incubation medium was collected in the tube containing 50 µl of 4 m perchloric acid
and the remaining cells were supplemented with 0.5 ml of
0.8 m perchloric acid. after centrifuging the medium and
the cell lysates, aliquots of the supernatants were applied on
high-performance liquid chromatography with an electrochemical detector to assay dopamine.22–24 dopamine release
was expressed as (released dopamine/released dopamine and
cellular dopamine)100 (%).
mitogen-activated protein kinase activity
pc12 cells were cultured in six-well dishes under differentiated conditions and used for map kinase activity
assay.42 after 24-h incubation without serum and ngf, the
cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and
incubated with dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium containing 5 mm hepes (ph 7.4) at 37c for 10 min. then
drugs were added to the medium and incubated at 37c for
the indicated period. after the incubation, the medium was
aspirated and the cells were washed once with ice-cold
phosphate-buffered saline and twice with ice-cold 20 mm
tris–hcl (ph 7.4). ice-cold extraction buffer (1 ml; mm:
tris–hcl 10, edta 0.5, egta 0.5, mgcl2 5, dithiothreitol
1, naf 0.05, na3vo4 0.5, phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride
0.5, â-glycerophosphate 5, aprotinin 10 µg/ml, leupeptin
10 µg/ml; ph 7.4) was added, and cells scraped off and
collected in ice-cold tubes. after sonicating the cells twice
for 10 s, cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 r.p.m. for
10 min. the resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at
30,000 r.p.m. for 20 min and the final supernatant was
stored at 80c until the assay of map kinase activity.
map kinase activity of cell lysates was measured with a
map kinase assay kit and [ã-32p]atp (amersham life
science) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
protein content
protein content was measured using bio-rad protein
assay (richmond, ca, u.s.a.), with bovine  xxxg124xxx 
as the standard.5

results

first, we examined whether  xxxd3166xxx  stimulates
ca2+ uptake into pc12 cells as an index for ca2+
channel activity independently of its cofactor activity,
as observed in rat neuronal cells.41 when the cells
were depolarized by administration of kcl at
50 mm, 45ca2+ uptake into the cells began to increase within 10 s and reached a plateau at 40 s. the
maximal level induced by high kcl was about twofold of the control value and remained until 120 s.
administration of  xxxd3166xxx  (30 µm) also stimulated
45
ca2+ uptake in a similar manner to kcl (fig. 1).
according to these results, we measured 45ca2+ uptake during 60 s as an index of ca2+ channel activity
in the following experiments.
the increase in 45ca2+ uptake during 60-s stimulation with high kcl was completely eliminated by
1 µm  xxxd2718xxx , a dihydropyridine-type blocker of
voltage-gated ca2+ channels. administration of 6rbh4 (1, 10, 30 and 100 µm) increased 45ca2+ uptake
in a dose-related manner. the increase in 45ca2+
uptake induced by  xxxd3166xxx  was maximal at 30 µm
(about 140% of the control value). the 6r-bh4induced increase in 45ca2+ uptake was completely
eliminated in the presence of 1 µm  xxxd2718xxx . since
 xxxd3166xxx  is a cofactor for  xxxg2276xxx  and
nos, both of which are present in differentiated
pc12 cells,16,35 we investigated whether the stimulating effect of  xxxd3166xxx  on 45ca2+ uptake is mediated by
catecholamine or no. even in the presence of inhibi-

added during the incubation period alone. each value is

tors of  xxxg2276xxx  (á-mt, at 1 mm) or
nos (-name, at 0.1 mm),  xxxd3166xxx  (30 µm) increased 45ca2+ uptake into the cells to the same
extent as in the absence of the inhibitors. the effect of
 xxxd3166xxx  on 45ca2+ uptake was not mimicked by
-dopa and dopamine, both of which are products
of tyrosine hydroxylation, or noc-5, an no generator. to investigate the mechanism of 6r-bh4induced increase in 45ca2+ uptake into the cells, we
studied the involvement of protein kinases. the increase in 45ca2+ uptake induced by 30 µm  xxxd3166xxx 
was eliminated with rp-camps (1 mm), an inhibitor
of  xxxg1836xxx . administration of 8-br-camp
(1 mm), a membrane-permeable adenosine-3 ,5 cyclic monophosphate (camp) analogue, increased
45
ca2+ uptake into the cells. in contrast, administration of  xxxd2925xxx  (tpa),
an activator of protein kinase c, at 1 µm did not
affect 45ca2+ uptake into the cells (fig. 2).
we then examined the effects of  xxxd3166xxx  on
cellular viability. after five-day culture under various
conditions, microphotographs were taken. the cells
cultured without serum and ngf showed somatic
atrophy, neurite degeneration and extensive cell
death. in the presence of 50 mm kcl, a great number
of cells survived with differentiated form under
depletion of serum and ngf. when the cells were
cultured with 30 µm  xxxd3166xxx , many cells survived
under depletion of serum and ngf, but surviving
cells showed undifferentiated form (fig. 3).
to quantitate the effect of  xxxd3166xxx  on cell viability,
we estimated the number of viable cells cultured

under various conditions using mtt assay (fig. 4).
when the cells were cultured without serum and
ngf for five days, the viable cell number estimated
with the od for the mtt product decreased significantly as compared with the od of viable cells
cultured with serum and ngf. administration of
high k+ (50 mm) to the medium significantly
increased the number of viable cells cultured without
serum and ngf. when the cells were cultured with
 xxxd3166xxx  (1–100 µm), the viable cell number in the
absence of serum and ngf increased in a doserelated manner. at 30 µm, the effect of  xxxd3166xxx  became maximal. when  xxxd2718xxx  was added to the
medium at 1 µm together with  xxxd3166xxx , the 6r-bh4induced increase in viable cell number in the absence
of serum and ngf was abolished. in contrast, even
in the presence of á-mt (1 mm) or -name
(0.1 mm), the  xxxd3166xxx -induced increase in the
number of viable cells cultured in the absence of
serum and ngf persisted. the  xxxd3166xxx -induced
increase in viable cell number was eliminated by rp-

camps (1 mm), and administration of 8-br-camp
(1 mm) increased the number of viable cells cultured
in the absence of serum and ngf. the increase in
viable cells induced by 8-br-camp was blunted by
 xxxd2718xxx , as was that induced by  xxxd3166xxx . administration of 1 µm tpa had no effect on the survival of
pc12 cells cultured without serum and ngf.
we compared the effect of  xxxd3166xxx  with that of
6s-bh4, a diastereoisomer of  xxxd3166xxx . as observed
with  xxxd3166xxx , 6s-bh4 stimulated 45ca2+ uptake and
enhanced cell survival. however, the effects of 6sbh4 were much less potent than those of  xxxd3166xxx 
(fig. 5).
next, we examined the effects of  xxxd3166xxx  on
45
ca2+ uptake and dopamine release in pc12 cells
cultured without serum and ngf (fig. 6). when the
cells were cultured with serum and ngf, high-k+induced depolarization increased 45ca2+ uptake into
the cells about three-fold compared to the control
value. after five-day culture without serum and
ngf, 45ca2+ uptake into the cells were not stimu-

release increased about two-fold compared to that of
control cells cultured with serum and ngf. high-k+
stimulation had no effect on dopamine release from
the cells cultured without serum and ngf. when the
cells were cultured with  xxxd3166xxx  (30 µm) under depletion of serum and ngf, basal dopamine release
increased and high-k+ stimulation did not significantly increase dopamine release as observed in the
absence of  xxxd3166xxx  (fig. 6b).
finally, we examined the effect of  xxxd3166xxx  on
map kinase activity in pc12 cells. when pc12 cells
were cultured with ngf (100 ng/ml) for 2.5, 5 or
10 min, map kinase activity increased significantly.
in contrast, incubation of pc12 cells with  xxxd3166xxx 
(30 µm) for 2.5, 5 or 10 min did not stimulate map
kinase activity (fig. 7).
discussion

as observed in rat neurons,41  xxxd3166xxx  activates
voltage-gated ca2+ channels in pc12 cells. 45ca2+
uptake into pc12 cells was increased by depolarization with kcl in a time-dependent manner and the
kcl-induced increase in 45ca2+ uptake was completely inhibited by  xxxd2718xxx , indicating that
45
ca2+ uptake is an index of voltage-gated ca2+
channel activity.  xxxd3166xxx  also activated 45ca2+ uptake in a similar manner to kcl. 45ca2+ uptake was
significantly increased by  xxxd3166xxx  at concentrations
greater than 10 µm, which is assumed to be a physio-

logical concentration in the brain.30 previous reports that ca2+ channels can be activated by catecholamine3,14 or no19,25 suggest the possibility that the
 xxxd3166xxx -induced increase in 45ca2+ uptake is due to
activation of  xxxg2276xxx  or nos in pc12
cells. however, even in the presence of inhibitors of
 xxxg2276xxx  (á-mt) or nos (-name), the
 xxxd3166xxx -induced increase in 45ca2+ uptake into pc12
cells was unchanged. the effect of  xxxd3166xxx  on 45ca2+
uptake was not mimicked either by -dopa or
dopamine, products of tyrosine hydroxylation, nor
by noc-5, an no generator. these results indicate
that the stimulating effect of  xxxd3166xxx  on 45ca2+
uptake is independent of its cofactor activities. several lines of evidence indicate that ca2+ channels
are activated when they are phosphorylated by
protein kinase a9,40,48 or protein kinase c.27,50
therefore, we investigated whether the effect of
 xxxd3166xxx  is mimicked by activators of protein kinase
a or protein kinase c. administration of 8-brcamp, which activates  xxxg1836xxx , increased
45
ca2+ uptake into pc12 cells, and the increase in
45
ca2+ uptake induced by  xxxd3166xxx  was eliminated
by rp-camps, an inhibitor of  xxxg1836xxx . in
contrast, tpa, an activator of protein kinase c,
had no effect on 45ca2+ uptake into pc12 cells.
these results, taken together, suggest that  xxxd3166xxx 
activates ca2+ channels in pc12 cells through the
camp– xxxg1836xxx  pathway.
in the absence of serum and ngf, somatic
atrophy, neurite degeneration and extensive death
occurred in pc12 cells, as reported previously.4 the
cell death induced by depletion of serum and ngf
was prevented by administration of high k+. these
findings are compatible with previous reports that
high-k+-induced depolarization enhances survival

tetrahydrobiopterin enhances neuronal survival

of trophic agent-deprived neuronal cells by activating ca2+ channels,6,10,20,21 and suggest that ca2+
channel activation enhances survival of pc12 cells
cultured without serum and ngf. the number of
viable pc12 cells cultured under depletion of serum
and ngf was increased by  xxxd3166xxx  in a doserelated manner within the physiological range.30 the
effect of  xxxd3166xxx  on cell survival was eliminated by
 xxxd2718xxx , a ca2+ channel blocker. from these
results, it is suggested that  xxxd3166xxx  enhances survival
of pc12 cells by activating ca2+ channels to increase
intracellular ca2+ concentrations.
since  xxxd3166xxx  is a cofactor for  xxxg2276xxx  and nos, both of which are present in pc12
cells,16,35 it is possible that  xxxd3166xxx  enhances cell
survival by stimulating the synthesis of catecholamine
or no. however, this possibility is not likely because
the effect of  xxxd3166xxx  on cell survival persisted in the
presence of inhibitors of  xxxg2276xxx  (á-mt)
and nos (-name). these findings are compatible
with the observation that  xxxd3166xxx  activates ca2+
channels independently of its cofactor activity. the
cell-surviving effect of  xxxd3166xxx  was mimicked by a
camp analogue (8-br-camp) and inhibited by a
 xxxg1836xxx  inhibitor (rp-camps). tpa, an
activator for protein kinase c, had no effect on cell
survival in the absence of serum and ngf. these
results, taken together, suggest that  xxxd3166xxx  enhances
cell survival via the camp– xxxg1836xxx  pathway,
as observed in the  xxxd3166xxx -induced activation of
ca2+ channels. the present study cannot exclude the
possibility that  xxxd3166xxx  enhances cell survival by initially activating ca2+ channels, which in turn stimulate the camp– xxxg1836xxx  pathway. however,
this is not likely, because the  xxxd3166xxx -induced
activation of ca2+ channels in pc12 cells was
mimicked by 8-br-camp, the stimulatory effect of
which was inhibited by  xxxd2718xxx . several lines of
evidence indicate that camp stimulates the biosynthesis of  xxxd3166xxx .2,17,36,51 thus, it may be possible
that the 8-br-camp-induced enhancement of cell survival observed in the present study is mediated by
biosynthesis of  xxxd3166xxx .
as reported previously,22–24,41 the stimulatory
effects of  xxxd3166xxx  on dopamine release and ca2+ channel activity are stereospecific in the rat brain. that is,
6s-bh4, a diastereoisomer of  xxxd3166xxx , had little effect
on dopamine release and ca2+ channel activity in the
rat brain. in pc12 cells, 6s-bh4 stimulated 45ca2+
uptake and cell survival, but the effects of 6s-bh4
were much less potent than those of  xxxd3166xxx . thus,
the effects of  xxxd3166xxx  are considered to have stereospecificity in pc12 cells, as well as in the rat brain.
surviving pc12 cells cultured with  xxxd3166xxx  showed
an undifferentiated form, suggesting that  xxxd3166xxx  has

567

a cell-surviving effect but not a cell-differentiating
effect. ca2+ channel activity as indexed by 45ca2+
uptake into the cells was preserved by  xxxd3166xxx  after
five-day culture without serum and ngf, but
depolarization-induced dopamine release was not
observed in the cells cultured either in the presence or
absence of  xxxd3166xxx  under depletion of serum and
ngf. since the basal dopamine release increased in
the cells cultured without serum and ngf, it is
considered that, even in the presence of  xxxd3166xxx , the
cellular membrane became leaky under depletion of
serum and ngf. thus, the neuronal activities were
not fully preserved in pc12 cells cultured with 6rbh4 under depletion of serum and ngf. these
results suggest that the mechanism of action of
 xxxd3166xxx  is different from that of ngf or high k+.
the action of ngf is known to be mediated by map
kinase cascade.11,45 high-k+-induced depolarization
stimulates voltage-dependent ca2+ channels, which
also activate map kinase cascade.37,38 therefore, it
is speculated that map kinase cascade is a common
signalling pathway of the actions of ngf and high
k+ on neuronal survival and/or differentiation.8
recently, it has been reported that the effect of ngf
on cell survival persisted even after inhibition of
map kinase activity,7 suggesting that a cell-surviving
effect and a cell-differentiating effect are exerted by
distinct mechanisms. as shown in the present study,
 xxxd3166xxx  had no effect on map kinase activity, indicating that  xxxd3166xxx  enhances cell survival independently of map kinase cascade, as observed in the
cell-surviving effect of ngf.7 although both high
k+ and  xxxd3166xxx  activate voltage-dependent ca2+
channels, cell differentiation was maintained by high
k+ but not  xxxd3166xxx . this discrepancy cannot be
fully elucidated in the present study. it may be due
to differences in the character of ca2+ channel
activation, such as intensity and duration.

conclusion

the present study raises the possibility that
 xxxd3166xxx  acts physiologically as a cell-surviving agent
by activating ca2+ channels via the camp–protein
kinase a pathway, but not by activating an map
kinase cascade in the brain. taking account of its
trophic effect, in addition to its stimulating effects
on synthesis32 and release22–24 of catecholamines,
 xxxd3166xxx  may be a promising drug for neurodegenerative changes in catecholaminergic neurons.
