forms (3).  xxxg1062xxx  expression is induced in response to its substrate heme by the second messengers camp and cgmp (5), by
various stress stimuli such as uv light, heat-shock (6), sulfhydryl reactive reagents (7), heavy metals, anoxia, hypoxia, hyperoxia (8, 9), as well as by inflammatory cytokines such as
 xxxg2296xxx  ␣ (tnf␣), interleukin-1␤ (il-1␤), or interferon-␥ (ifn␥) (10, 11). the up-regulation of  xxxg1062xxx  expression by these stimuli and their observed toxic effects in various
organs of  xxxg1062xxx -deficient mice (12) indicated that the enhancement of  xxxg1062xxx  activity was an adaptive and protective response
to cellular stress (11, 13).
the transcriptional activation of  xxxg1062xxx  and other genes is
mediated by a network of signaling pathways, mostly by modulation of the activities of transcription factors and target gene
expression. a central position in the signaling cascades regulating a number of cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, stress responses, and apoptosis occupy mitogenactivated protein kinases (mapks). three major subfamilies of
mapks have been described: extracellular signal-regulated kinases (erk) (14), c-jun n-terminal kinases (jnk) (15), and
p38 (16, 17). in general, the erk pathway mediates cellular
responses to growth and differentiation factors including platelet-derived growth factor,  xxxg681xxx , and  xxxg1180xxx ,
whereas jnk and p38 kinases are activated by stress-related
stimuli, such as heat shock, inflammation, hyperosmolarity,
ultraviolet, and ␥ irradiation (18).
arsenic in the form of sodium arsenite, like other heavy
metals, is also a potent inducer of heme oxygenase (19); the
mechanism of this induction seems to be cell- and species-dependent (20 –22). arsenite is known to react with thiol groups
of different proteins (e.g. receptors) and to be one of the inducers of erk, jnk, and p38 cascades (23, 24). this appears to be
mediated by the activation of shc due to tyrosine phosphorylation (25) and recruitment of the grb2-sos complex which can
activate the p21 small gtpases of the rho family ras and rac.
ras, in turn, activates either the erk pathway or via action on
pak the jnk or p38 pathway. rac activation can lead again to
pak activation and subsequently to the activation of jnk and
p38 (26).
in liver cells the only detailed report so far regarding the role
of mapks in  xxxg1062xxx  gene regulation had demonstrated that in
the lmh chicken hepatoma cell line sodium arsenite-dependent induction of  xxxg1062xxx  gene expression was mediated by the
erk and p38 pathways (21). despite the extensive characterization of the mapk signal transduction pathways and the
nearly universal induction of  xxxg1062xxx  expression by stress-related
stimuli, conflicting data have been reported as to the involvement of mapks pathways in  xxxg1062xxx  gene activation in various
tumor cell lines (20, 21, 27–29). moreover, little is known about

 xxxg1062xxx  ( xxxg1062xxx ) gene expression is induced
by various oxidative stress stimuli including sodium
arsenite. since mitogen-activated protein kinases
(mapks) are involved in stress signaling we investigated the role of arsenite and mapks for  xxxg1062xxx  gene
regulation in primary rat hepatocytes. the  xxxg1370xxx  (jnk) inhibitor  xxxd3231xxx  decreased sodium
arsenite-mediated induction of  xxxg1062xxx  mrna expression.
 xxxg1062xxx  protein and luciferase activity of reporter gene
constructs with ⴚ754 bp of the  xxxg1062xxx  promoter were
induced by overexpression of kinases of the jnk pathway and  xxxg1363xxx . by contrast, overexpression of  xxxg1924xxx  and
 xxxg1366xxx  did not affect expression whereas overexpression
of p38␣, ␤, and ␦ decreased and p38␥ increased  xxxg1062xxx 
expression. electrophoretic mobility shift assays
(emsa) revealed that a cre/ap-1 element (ⴚ668/ⴚ654)
bound c-jun, a target of the jnk pathway. deletion or
mutation of the cre/ap-1 obliterated the jnk- and c-jundependent up-regulation of luciferase activity. emsa
also showed that an e-box (ⴚ47/ⴚ42) was bound by a
putative p38 target c-max. mutation of the e-box
strongly reduced  xxxg1363xxx , p38 isoform-, and c-max-dependent effects on luciferase activity. thus, the  xxxg1062xxx 
cre/ap-1 element mediates  xxxg1062xxx  gene induction via
activation of jnk/c-jun whereas p38 isoforms act
through a different mechanism via the e-box.

rat  xxxg1062xxx  gene expression is regulated by map kinases
 xxxg1062xxx  gene expression in response to the activation by arsenite
and mapks in primary cultured cells. thus, it was the goal of
the present study to investigate the regulation of rat  xxxg1062xxx  gene
expression by mapks using primary rat hepatocyte cultures as
a model system. in our study basal levels of  xxxg1062xxx  mrna
expression as well as sodium arsenite-induced  xxxg1062xxx  mrna
levels were down-regulated in the presence of jnk inhibitor
 xxxd3231xxx . it was demonstrated that the ras pathway via jnk
induced  xxxg1062xxx  gene expression while the raf pathway via erk
was not involved in the regulation of  xxxg1062xxx  gene expression.
the promoter sequence ⫺668/⫺654 of the rat  xxxg1062xxx  gene was
shown to be responsible for  xxxg1062xxx  activation by jnk and jun.

fig. 1. involvement of map kinases in the induction of rat
 xxxg1062xxx  gene expression by sodium arsenite. primary hepatocytes
were cultured for 42 h. 8 h before harvesting, the cells were treated with
5 ␮m sodium arsenite (naaso4) and with inhibitors of the mek/erk
pathway  xxxd1169xxx  (5 ␮m) and  xxxd3462xxx  (10 ␮m), of the jnk pathway
 xxxd3231xxx  (25 ␮m) and of the p38 pathway  xxxd3177xxx  (20 ␮m). a,  xxxg1062xxx 
mrna levels were measured by northern blotting. for northern analysis 20 ␮g of total rna prepared from the cultured hepatocytes were
hybridized to digoxigenin-labeled  xxxg1062xxx  and ␤-actin antisense rna
probes (see “experimental procedures”). autoradiographic signals were
obtained by chemiluminescence and scanned by videodensitometry. the
mrna level in untreated hepatocytes was set equal to 100%. values are

and were purchased from commercial suppliers.
cell culture—cells from male wistar rats (200 –250 g) were used for
culture experiments. hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion (30). about 1 ⫻ 106 cells were cultured at 37 °c on 6-cm falcon
culture dishes under air/co2 (19:5) in medium 199 with earle’s salts
containing bovine  xxxg124xxx  (2 g/liter), nahco3 (20 mm), hepes
(10 mm), streptomycin sulfate (117 mg/liter), penicillin (60 mg/liter),
insulin (1 nm), and dexamethasone (10 nm). fetal calf serum (5%) was
present in the initial 5 h after which cultures were incubated in serumfree medium for another 18 h. then, medium was changed again, and
the cells were further cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h. hepatocytes were treated with 5 ␮m sodium arsenite 8 h before harvesting.
the specific inhibitors of mek  xxxd1169xxx  (new england biolabs) (5 ␮m)
and  xxxd3462xxx  (cell signaling) (10 ␮m), of jnk  xxxd3231xxx  (biomol) (25 ␮m)
and of p38  xxxd3177xxx  (calbiochem) (20 ␮m) were added to the culture
medium also 8 h before harvesting.
plasmid constructs—the luciferase reporter gene constructs pho754 and pho-754⌬a were previously described (5). the luciferase reporter gene construct pho-347 was generated by deletion of the ⫺754/
⫺347 fragment of ho-754 by apai and kpni followed by blunting of the
remaining vector with klenow enzyme and ligation. the luciferase
construct pho-754em was generated with the quickchangetm xl
site-directed mutagenesis kit (stratagene) using the oligonucleotide
5⬘-ggctcagctgggcggccacctctagactcgagtac-3⬘. the luciferase constructs p(cre/ap-1)3-sv40luc and p(cre/ap-1)6-sv40luc
were generated by ligation of the oligonucleotide 5⬘-gatcctgacttcagtctgaattcctgacttcagtctgacttcagtc-3⬘ containing 3
cre/ap-1 elements into the bglii site of  xxxg2041xxx  prom (psv40luc) (promega). expression vectors for map kinase signaling pathway components and transcription factors have been described:  xxxg1366xxx  (31),
mekk1 (32),  xxxg1370xxx  (33),  xxxg1363xxx , dominant-negative  xxxg1363xxx , dominantnegative mkk4 (34), p38 isoforms, and dominant-negative p38 isoforms
(16, 35–37), h-ras (38), dominant-negative h-ras (dnras) (38),  xxxg1924xxx 
(39), c-jun (40), c-myc (41).
rna isolation, northern blot analysis, and hybridization—isolation
of total rna and northern analysis were performed as described (42).
digoxigenin (dig)-labeled antisense rnas served as hybridization
probes; they were generated as described (43) by in vitro transcription
from pbs- xxxg1062xxx  (800-bp cdna fragment) using t3 rna polymerase or
from pbs-␤ actin (550-bp cdna fragment) using t7 rna polymerase
and rna labeling mixture containing 3.5 mm 11-dig-utp, 6.5 mm
utp, 10 mm gtp, 10 mm ctp, 10 mm atp. hybridizations and detections were carried out essentially as described before (42). blots were
quantified with a videodensitometer (biotech fischer, reiskirchen).
western blot analysis—western blot analysis was carried out as
described (5). in brief, total protein from primary cultured hepatocytes
was prepared and the protein content was determined using the bradford method. 50 ␮g of protein were loaded onto a 10% sds-polyacrylamide gel and after electrophoresis blotted onto nitrocellulose mem-

involvement of the jnk pathway in the sodium arsenite-dependent  xxxg1062xxx  mrna expression—to investigate whether the
sodium arsenite-dependent  xxxg1062xxx  induction occurs via the activation of various mapk signaling pathways primary hepatocytes were treated with sodium arsenite in the presence of
specific inhibitors of the erk, jnk, or p38 pathways. 5 ␮m

cell transfection and luciferase assay—freshly isolated rat hepatocytes (about 1 ⫻ 106 cells per dish) were transfected as described (5).
in brief, rat hepatocyte cultures (about 1 ⫻ 106 cells per dish) were
transiently transfected with 2.5 ␮g of plasmid dna containing 500 ng
of the renilla luciferase construct prl-sv40 (promega) to control
transfection efficiency and 2 ␮g of the appropriate  xxxg1062xxx  promoter
firefly luciferase (fl) construct. in every culture experiment two cultures were transfected per point. the dna was transfected as a calcium
phosphate precipitate (5) for 5 h. after removal of the medium cells
were cultured under standard conditions without serum. 24 h later cells
were treated with fresh medium and were cultured for another 12 h.
12 h before harvesting the cells were treated with  xxxd1169xxx  (5 ␮m),
 xxxd3462xxx  (10 ␮m),  xxxd3231xxx  (25 ␮m),  xxxd3177xxx  (20 ␮m), or  xxxd2523xxx 
(cell signaling) (10 ␮m), as indicated. the luc activity of 20 ␮l of cell
lysate was recorded in a luminometer (berthold) using the dual luciferase assay kit (promega).
preparation of nuclear extracts and electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (emsa)—nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described (44). the sequences of the  xxxg1062xxx  oligonucleotides used for the
emsa are 5⬘-tgtgtcagagccatgtgtcctgacttcagtct-3⬘
(spanning the cre/ap-1 (⫺664/⫺657), fig. 4) and 5⬘-ggctcagctgggcggccaccacgtgactcgagtac-3⬘ (spanning the e-box (⫺47/

annealed and labeled by 5⬘ end-labeling with [␥-32p]atp (amersham
biosciences) and t4 polynucleotide kinase (mbi). they were purified
with the nucleotide removal kit (qiagen). binding reactions were
carried out in a total volume of 20 ␮l containing 50 mm kcl, 1 mm
mgcl2, 1 mm edta, 5% glycerol, 10 ␮g of nuclear extract, 250 ng of
poly(d(i-c)), and 5 mm dte. for competition analyses a 50-fold molar
excess of unlabeled  xxxg1222xxx  consensus oligonucleotide (promega) was
added. after preincubation for 5 min at room temperature, 1 ␮l of the
labeled probe (104 cpm) was added, and the incubation was continued
for an additional 10 min. for supershift analysis 1 ␮l of the atf/

(fig. 1c). these results indicated that kinases of the jnk and
p38 pathways were involved in the regulation of  xxxg1062xxx  expression by sodium arsenite. since the jnk and p38 pathways can
be activated by mekk1, the question of whether overexpression of mekk1 activates these pathways in hepatocytes was
examined. indeed, mekk1 overexpression led to the activation
of the jnk and p38 pathway as demonstrated by the phosphorylation of  xxxg1222xxx  and p38 (fig. 1d).
regulation of transfected  xxxg1062xxx  gene promoter constructs by
overexpression of map kinases in primary rat hepatocytes—to further investigate the regulatory role of map kinases for  xxxg1062xxx  gene expression primary cultured rat hepatocytes were transfected with expression vectors for human
h-ras,  xxxg1924xxx , mekk1,  xxxg1363xxx ,  xxxg1366xxx ,  xxxg1370xxx , and p38. overexpression of these proteins was confirmed by western blot analysis. hepatocytes transfected with h-ras, mekk1,  xxxg1370xxx , or
 xxxg1363xxx  expression vectors showed enhanced  xxxg1062xxx  protein levels. by contrast, transfection with  xxxg1924xxx  as well as  xxxg1366xxx  had
no effect on the  xxxg1062xxx  expression while transfection with p38
led to a significant decrease of  xxxg1062xxx  protein levels (fig. 2). the
observed pattern appeared to be specific for  xxxg1062xxx  since neither
construct changed expression of  xxxg1063xxx  or actin.
to examine the molecular mechanism of  xxxg1062xxx  gene regulation by mapks luciferase reporter gene constructs from the rat
 xxxg1062xxx  promoter (46) (pho-754, pho-750⌬a (5), and pho-347)
were cotransfected with expression vectors encoding various
components of the mapk signaling pathways (fig. 3). luciferase expression of pho-754 was up-regulated by constitutive
active h-ras, mekk1, and  xxxg1363xxx  but not by  xxxg1924xxx  or dominant-negative ras (dnras). after cotransfection of both h-ras
and dnras expression vectors the stimulatory effect of h-ras
was attenuated by dnras (fig. 3). cotransfection of mekk1
and dominant-negative mutants of  xxxg1363xxx  and mkk4 downregulated  xxxg1062xxx  promoter activity. the up-regulation of luc
activity of pho-754⌬a and pho-347, both of which lack the
previously described  xxxg1062xxx  cre/ap-1 element (5), by overexpressed mekk1 was reduced compared with pho-754 (fig.
3a). furthermore, the dominant-negative  xxxg1363xxx  still abolished
luc activity whereas the dominant-negative mkk4 did not.
the same pattern was seen with pho-347. this indicated that
the jnk pathway acted primarily through the cre/ap-1 ele-

ment, and the p38 pathway via an element inside the first
⫺347 bases of the  xxxg1062xxx  promoter. however, the remaining
induction of pho-347 by mekk1 was not attenuated by the
inhibitors of either erk, jnk, p38, or pi3k/pkb because

mekk1-dependent enhancement of luc activity. by contrast,
the inhibitor of the p38 pathway  xxxd3177xxx  led to an induction
of luc activity.

investigated in the presence of overexpressed  xxxg1370xxx , and for
comparison also  xxxg1366xxx .  xxxg1370xxx  enhanced luc activity of pho754, which was abolished in the presence of the jnk inhibitor
 xxxd3231xxx . a jnk-dependent induction was not observed with
pho-754⌬a or pho-347. by contrast,  xxxg1366xxx  did not affect luc
expression of the transfected  xxxg1062xxx  reporter gene constructs
(fig. 4).
taken together, these results indicate that activation of the
jnk pathway may induce  xxxg1062xxx  gene expression through the
 xxxg1062xxx  cre/ap-1 site.
role of the  xxxg1062xxx  cre/ap-1 element in the activation of  xxxg1062xxx 
promoter luc constructs by c-jun—since the transcription
factor jun is a substrate of jnk it was investigated whether
c-jun can bind directly to the cre/ap-1 element of the  xxxg1062xxx 
promoter. emsa studies with nuclear extracts of cultured rat
hepatocytes and an oligonucleotide containing the  xxxg1062xxx  cre/
ap-1 site formed a strong protein-dna complex. the intensity
of this complex was reduced by an unlabeled ap-1 consensus
oligonucleotide added in a 50-fold molar excess to the binding
reaction (fig. 5).
to investigate the presence of ap-1 and members of the
atf/creb family in this complex antibodies against c-jun,
c-fos, and atf/creb were included in the binding reactions.
in the presence of the atf/creb antibody a slightly supershifted complex was observed (fig. 5). in addition, the binding
of the protein complex to the cre/ap-1 nucleotide was enhanced. addition of antibodies against c-fos, as well as against
the gc-box binding factor sp-1 or a rabbit preimmune serum,
did not result in a supershift or inhibition of complex forma-

tion. the jun antibody, which was raised against the highly
conserved dna binding domain of c-jun (c-junc) abolished
dna-protein complex formation. addition of the c-junn antibody generated against the n-terminal domain formed a strong
supershifted complex, indicating that the cre/ap-1 site was
bound mostly by c-jun.
to verify the functional relevance of c-jun binding to the
 xxxg1062xxx  cre/ap-1 element the pho-754 and pho-754⌬a luciferase constructs were cotransfected with expression vectors for
c-jun and c-fos. overexpression of both c-jun and c-fos was
confirmed by western blot analysis. overexpression of c-jun,
but not c-fos, strongly induced luciferase activity of pho754
(fig. 6a). no induction was observed for the pho-754⌬a construct in the presence of overexpressed c-jun and c-fos. similarly, c-jun but not c-fos induced luciferase activity of sv40

ap-1 element (fig. 6b). cotransfection of c-jun did not induce
luciferase activity of the control psv40luc vector. thus, it

discussion

the present investigation has shown that kinases of the jnk
pathway are involved in the induction of rat  xxxg1062xxx  gene expression by sodium arsenite in primary cultured rat hepatocytes.
rat  xxxg1062xxx  gene expression is induced by ras via mapks
through the jnk (mekk1, jnk) pathway but not via mapks
of the erk (raf,  xxxg1366xxx ) pathway. jnk activation was mediated via a cre/ap-1 element (⫺668/⫺654) which was bound
mainly by c-jun. furthermore, different roles of the p38 kinases could be demonstrated because  xxxg1363xxx  acted as an inducer of  xxxg1062xxx , and the specific inhibitor of p38 pathway alone
did not influence  xxxg1062xxx  induction by sodium arsenite. the mkk3dependent induction was partially mediated by p38␥ via an
e-box element (⫺47/⫺42), which also appeared to be the target
for direct inhibition of  xxxg1062xxx  expression by the p38 kinasese ␣,
␤, and ␦. the target site for p38 was bound by max. overexpression of max, like the p38 ␣, ␤, and ␦ isoforms, inhibited
 xxxg1062xxx  expression.

appears that c-jun is the major protein that interacts with the
cre/ap-1 element.
inhibition of  xxxg1062xxx -driven luciferase activity by p38 and
c-max is abolished by mutation of the  xxxg1062xxx  e-box element—
induction of  xxxg1062xxx  protein expression by overexpression of
 xxxg1363xxx  and its repression by p38 suggested the presence of
response elements for the p38 pathway within the  xxxg1062xxx  promoter. candidate transcription factors mediating the activation by p38 are myc and max (49). these basic helix-loop-helix
leucine zipper (bhlhzip) proteins (50) are known to bind to
e-box elements one of which is also found in the rat  xxxg1062xxx 
promoter (⫺47/⫺42) (51). the potential binding of nuclear
proteins to oligonucleotide probes spanning the e-box sequence of the rat  xxxg1062xxx  promoter was examined by emsa
studies. the oligonucleotide ⫺66/⫺32 containing the e-box
formed two protein complexes, which were no longer detectable with a mutated oligonucleotide (fig. 7). to investigate
the presence of bhlhzip factors in these complexes antibodies against myc and max were included in the binding reaction. addition of max antibody led to formation of a supershifted complex. surprisingly, incubation of the e-box
oligonucleotide with an antibody against myc did not result
in a supershift or inhibition of the complex indicating max
homodimer formation. to ensure specificity of the supershift
mediated by the max antibody the emsa was also performed
in the presence of an antibody against the gc-box binding
factor sp-1. the sp-1 antibody did not affect the complex
formation with the e- box oligonucleotide.
to investigate the functional role of the e-box in the regulation of  xxxg1062xxx  gene expression by mapk the wild-type pho-347
and the construct pho-347em, in which 3 of 6 bp of the e-box
(⫺47/⫺42) were mutated, were transfected along with expression vectors for  xxxg1363xxx , different isoforms of wild-type p38
(p38␣, ␤, ␥, ␦) or their respective dominant-negative forms
(p38␣, ␤, ␥, ␦, af) and the p38 target max. overexpression of
 xxxg1363xxx  enhanced pho-347-dependent luc activity, and this
enhancement was reduced in the pho-347em-transfected
cells. transfection of pho-347 with vectors for p38␣, p38␤, and
p38␦ as well as max inhibited luc activity whereas p38␥ enhanced luc activity. the effects of the different p38 isoforms
were reversed by use of the respective dominant-negative mutants p38␣af, p38␤af, p38 ␥af, p38␦af. furthermore, when
pho-347em was used neither a repression nor an induction of
luc activity was observed after cotransfection of the vectors for
the different p38 isoforms and their mutants (fig. 8). these
data indicate that the  xxxg1062xxx  e-box is responsible for the p38␣,
p38␤, and p38␦-dependent down-regulation and the p38␥-mediated induction of  xxxg1062xxx  expression.

rat  xxxg1062xxx  gene expression is regulated by map kinases

17933

cell-specific  xxxg1062xxx  gene activation by mapks— xxxg1062xxx  gene
expression is induced by various stress stimuli that activate
mapks. conversely, overexpression of  xxxg1062xxx  and  xxxg1062xxx -derived
co were shown to exert anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective
effects via mapks as mediators (52, 53). the role of mapks
have previously been demonstrated in various cell culture systems (20, 21, 27–29, 54), and contradictory results on the regulatory role of different mapk pathways for  xxxg1062xxx  gene expression were observed. results obtained in hela cells indicated
that the induction of human  xxxg1062xxx  by no was mediated via
erk and p38 pathways but not via the  xxxg1372xxx /jnk pathway
(29). in another human cell line, hepg2, overexpression of
mekk1, a kinase upstream of jnk, led to the induction of
 xxxg1062xxx  protein levels (28). on the other hand, it was reported
that the induction of  xxxg1062xxx  mrna expression by cadmium,
arsenite, and hemin was not mediated via mapks in hela cells
(20). in the same cells  xxxd3177xxx , an inhibitor of p38 mapk,
had no effect on the cadmium-, arsenite-, and hemin-dependent
 xxxg1062xxx  mrna induction.
in contrast, in the chicken hepatoma cell line lmh  xxxg1062xxx 

gene induction by sodium arsenite was mediated via erk and
p38 kinase pathways (21). transfection of lmh cells with
expression vectors for wild-type and activated forms of the
components of the erk pathway and the p38 cascade induced
chicken  xxxg1062xxx  promoter-driven luciferase activity whereas
dominant-negative forms of mapks blocked luciferase activity.
cotransfected expression vectors encoding wild-type and dominant-negative components of the jnk pathway (jnk,
mekk1, mlk3) with chicken  xxxg1062xxx  promoter luc reporter
genes did not affect luc expression and its induction by
arsenite. however, data from our study show that induction
of rat  xxxg1062xxx  expression by sodium arsenite was mediated via
the jnk pathway (fig. 1) and that  xxxg1062xxx  can be induced via
overexpression of jnk but not  xxxg1366xxx  (figs. 2– 4). accordingly, inefficiency of the erk pathway was demonstrated in
the cadmium-dependent activation of the mouse  xxxg1062xxx  gene,
thereby pointing for a role of the p38 cascade (27). a major
reason for these regulatory discrepancies could be species- or
cell-specific variations that may affect the regulation of  xxxg1062xxx 
gene expression via mapks and different mechanisms of

arsenite-dependent  xxxg1062xxx  induction.
jnk-mediated  xxxg1062xxx  gene activation in primary rat hepatocytes—different regulation of the rat and chicken gene by
mapks could be caused by the lack of an ap-1 site at ⫺668/
⫺654 in the chicken  xxxg1062xxx  promoter, which mediates  xxxg1062xxx 
gene activation via the jnk and jun pathway (fig. 4). although the rat and mouse  xxxg1062xxx  gene 5⬘-flanking regions exhibit a much higher sequence similarity than the rat and the
chicken  xxxg1062xxx  gene 5⬘-flanking regions (46, 55, 56) different
regulatory patterns were observed. it was shown that the two
distal enhancer regions e1 (⫺4 kb) and e2 (⫺10 kb) containing
several antioxidant response elements that are regulatory sites
for the transcription factor nrf2 are mainly responsible for

stress-induced activation of mouse  xxxg1062xxx  gene expression (22,
55, 57).
in contrast to the mouse gene, in the rat gene a number of
apparently inducer-specific regulatory elements are located in
the proximal promoter. these include the cre/ap-1 site, which
was shown in the present study to be responsible for the induction of rat  xxxg1062xxx  via the jnk pathway, a prostaglandin j2
element (⫺673/⫺668) and a heat shock element (⫺278/⫺263)
(5, 57–59). however, the ⫺754 bp rat  xxxg1062xxx  promoter does not
contain a binding site for nrf2. accordingly, overexpression of
nrf2 did not enhance rat  xxxg1062xxx  promoter activity in primary rat
hepatocytes although it was able to increase luc activity from
the nrf2 responsive mouse  xxxg1062xxx  pe1-luc gene (kindly provided by j. alam) (data not shown). however, this does not
preclude a role for nrf2 in the regulation of the rat  xxxg1062xxx  gene,
in particular, because  xxxg1062xxx  induction is lost in nrf2-deficient
mice (60). thus, there could be an nrf2 binding site in the yet
unknown rat  xxxg1062xxx  far upstream regulatory sequences, which
in addition to the sequences identified in this study might have
a potential role in rat  xxxg1062xxx  gene activation.
in the study with the mouse  xxxg1062xxx  gene, however, dominantnegative mutants of  xxxg1370xxx  and  xxxg1372xxx  did not reduce basal and
cadmium-induced pe1-luc activity suggesting that the
cadmium-dependent activation of the  xxxg1062xxx  gene was not mediated via the jnk pathway (27). this result is in contrast to
the findings of this study and to the observation with rat liver
in which induction of  xxxg1062xxx  mrna expression by the glutathione depletor phorone was mediated by  xxxg1370xxx  and c-jun (54).
however, in that study with rat liver the effects of mapks
other than  xxxg1370xxx  and  xxxg1372xxx  on rat  xxxg1062xxx  gene expression and
the localization of the jnk target site in the rat  xxxg1062xxx  promoter
were not examined. that glutathione depletion can regulate
ras/map kinases was previously demonstrated also in rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (61) and rat mesangial cells
(62). it is conceivable that the cascade identified in this study
via ras/mekk1/jnk/jun is responsible for the rat  xxxg1062xxx  gene
activation by phorone.
the finding that the cre/ xxxg1222xxx  element is the target site for
the transcription factor c-jun may also agree with previous
studies showing that cgmp/protein kinase g (pkg)-dependent
 xxxg1062xxx  gene activation is mediated via this site (5). since the
pkg signal can couple to the mekk-1 pathway (63) it is
conceivable that agents that stimulate the cgmp signaling like
atrial natriuretic peptide (anp) (64) activate  xxxg1062xxx  gene expression via the pkg-mekk1-jnk-jun cascade. in addition,
ap-1 has previously been demonstrated as a target of the
cgmp-dependent gene activation (5, 65, 66).
the most prominent ap-1 dimer is the c-jun/c-fos heterodimer, which appears to be involved in the activation of a
number of target genes (67). however, ap-1 may consist also of
heterodimers of c-jun and a member of the atf/creb family
especially atf-2 (68). the c-jun/c-fos heterodimer binds to the
tgantca consensus sequence whereas the c-jun/atf heterodimer binds preferentially to the tganntca consensus
site (69, 70). the rat  xxxg1062xxx  promoter cre/ap-1 site is homologous to the latter consensus sequence, which may be bound by
c-jun/atf proteins. this was supported by the data of emsa
studies in which antibodies against c-fos failed to produce a
supershifted complex (fig. 5). furthermore, overexpression of
c-jun induced  xxxg1062xxx  promoter activation whereas overexpression of c-fos showed a negative effect. this negative effect
could be explained by the assumption that overexpressed fos
dimerized with jun competing with the atf/creb. thus, it
appears that the  xxxg1062xxx  cre/ap-1 site is a binding site for
either jun homodimers or jun/atf heterodimers.

previously been shown to activate the mouse and chicken  xxxg1062xxx 
genes (21). in the mouse gene a stress response element in the
upstream e1 enhancer as target for nrf2 was shown to be
involved in p38-dependent induction (27). our data indicate
that in rat hepatocytes different p38 isoforms exert different
patterns in the regulation of  xxxg1062xxx  gene expression (fig. 8). we
observed a p38␥-dependent induction and inhibition of the
 xxxg1062xxx  promoter activity by the other p38 isoforms. this observation could explain why the p38 inhibitor  xxxd3177xxx  alone was
not effective on  xxxg1062xxx  expression. furthermore, such different
actions of p38 isoforms have been observed in other cell types
(71). interestingly, an inhibitory role for p38 has also been
previously described by others (28, 72). in particular, it was
shown that the p38 pathway may suppress ras proliferative
signaling in nih3t3 cells (72). furthermore, an inhibitory
effect of p38 on gene expression was also demonstrated (28, 73).
thereby, overexpression of wild-type p38 not only inhibited
basal expression of an antioxidant response element (are)-dependent luciferase reporter gene construct but also suppressed
are-luc activation by mekk1 in hepg2 cells (28). in the
same study mekk1 induced  xxxg1062xxx  expression (28).
in our study the e-box element (⫺47/⫺42) was identified as
target for p38-dependent induction and inhibition of  xxxg1062xxx  gene
expression. the  xxxg1062xxx  luc reporter gene construct containing a
mutated e-box was not repressed by cotransfection of vectors
encoding wild-type or mutated p38 (fig. 8).
the e-box sequence (cacgtg) is known to be bound by
members of the bhlh leucine zipper (bhlhzip) protein family
such as upstream stimulatory factors (usf) or the myc/max
dimer (74). among bhlhzip proteins the transcription factor
max (49) is known to be a target for p38 kinase. it was further
demonstrated that myc in contrast to max did not bind the
e-box element (⫺47/⫺42) of the rat  xxxg1062xxx  promoter (fig. 7).
although this finding was surprising, max not only forms heterodimers with myc, but also forms homodimers (75) and het-

erodimers with other members of the bhlhzip family such as
mad1, mad3, mad4, and mnt (76, 77). it was shown that in
contrast to the stimulatory effect of myc/max heterodimers on
transcription, max homodimers, or heterodimers between max
and members of the mad family of bhlh-zip proteins, repress
transcription (78). in our study an inhibitory effect of max
on  xxxg1062xxx -driven luc activity was also observed. mutation of the
 xxxg1062xxx  e-box abolished this effect. thus, the e-box of the rat
 xxxg1062xxx  gene promoter is a target site for p38- and maxmediated inhibition.
