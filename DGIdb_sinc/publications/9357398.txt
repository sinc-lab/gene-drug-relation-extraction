 xxxd2781xxx  and  xxxd2573xxx -related bone marrow suppression: a possible drug-drug interaction.  a patient with refractory crohn's disease had two separate episodes of bone marrow suppression while receiving 50 to 75 mg  xxxd2573xxx  a day and 1000 to 1750 mg  xxxd2781xxx  a day. this adverse reaction necessitated dose reduction of  xxxd2573xxx  on the first occasion and withdrawal of  xxxd2573xxx  and  xxxd2781xxx  on the second occasion. the patient's red blood cell  xxxg2319xxx  ( xxxg2319xxx ) activity was 1.2 u per milliliter red blood cells (low normal range) and her  xxxg2319xxx  genotype was wild-type sequence for all known alleles of  xxxg2319xxx  that result in low  xxxg2319xxx  enzyme activity. in vitro enzyme kinetic studies confirmed the hypothesis that  xxxd2781xxx  and  xxxd2781xxx -o-sulfate are potent noncompetitive inhibitors of recombinant human  xxxg2319xxx . we suggest that the patient's relatively low baseline level of  xxxg2319xxx  activity was inhibited by  xxxd2781xxx  and  xxxd2781xxx -o-sulfate, leading to decreased clearance of  xxxd2573xxx  and its accumulation. this ultimately increased intracellular  xxxd2573xxx  nucleotide levels to toxic concentrations, which caused bone marrow suppression.
