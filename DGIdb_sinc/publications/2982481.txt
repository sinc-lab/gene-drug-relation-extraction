abstract
the effects of the progesterone antagonist  xxxd2643xxx  and the
progesterone agonist  xxxd2557xxx  on the growth of the
estrogen- xxxg1737xxx -positive transplantable  xxxg1801xxx 
(acth)/prolactin-secreting
rat pituitary tumor
7315a were examined.  xxxd2643xxx  (2.5 mg/kg/day) for 30 days
significantly inhibited tumor size, tumor weight, and the plasma
prolactin and acth concentrations, while the same dose of
 xxxd2557xxx  only inhibited pituitary tumor weight. meges
 xxxd3105xxx  acetate inhibited both the release and total acth content of
the anterior pituitary gland, while  xxxd2643xxx  increased both the
release and the total acth content.
studies with acth secretion by cultured normal rat pituitary
cells showed that  xxxd2557xxx  (1 /â¿m)
did not affect  xxxg517xxx  (crf)-stimulated acth release after 4hr exposure, but inhibited crf-stimulated acth release by 50%
after 24-hr preincubation. the glucocorticoid-like effect of 1 mm
 xxxd2557xxx  in this model is similar to that exerted by 10
dm dexamethasone. acute exposure or preincubation of rat
pituitary cells with  xxxd2643xxx  (1 mm) did not influence crfstimulated acth release, while preincubation for 24 hr revealed
a dose-dependent reversing effect of  xxxd2643xxx  on dexamethasone-induced inhibition of crf-stimulated acth release. in this
model, 1 mmru 38486 completely overcame the effect of 10 nm
dexamethasone.
 xxxd2557xxx  and  xxxd2643xxx  have inhibitory effects on
the growth of the 7315a tumor. they differ both with regard to
their effects on the progesterone and the  xxxg1601xxx ,
with  xxxd2557xxx  exerting an agonistic and  xxxd2643xxx  an
antagonistic action.
introduction
the clinical use of progesterone is limited by its short bioavailability. this problem has been overcome by the introduction
of synthetic steroids which, although not much more active than
progesterone, are, unlike progesterone, also active after p.o.
administration (for review, see ref. 18). the best-known progestins are  xxxd2554xxx  and  xxxd2557xxx ,
which are widely used in cancer therapy (2, 3, 5, 16). these
alkylated and halogenated acetoxyprogesterone
derivatives
were shown to have also antiestrogenic, antigonadotropic, antiandrogenic, and certain glucocorticoid-like effects (18).

recently  xxxd2643xxx , a steroid [17-/3-hydroxy-11 -0-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)-17-a-(1-propynyl)estra-4,9-dien-3-one]
with high
affinity for the  xxxg1737xxx  but without progestomimetic activity (20) and, on the contrary, with powerful progester
one-antagonistic effects in that it induces interruption of the
lutea! phase of the menstrual cycle and early pregnancy in
monkeys and women (8, 10) was developed. in addition, ru
38486 has glucocorticoid-receptor-blocking
activity without ag
onist effects as proven both by in vitro (17, 21) and in vivo (9,
21) experiments.
in the present study, we compared the effects of chronic
administration of  xxxd2557xxx  and  xxxd2643xxx  on the growth
and hormone secretion of the estrogen/progesterone receptorpositive transplantable acth3/prl-secreting rat pituitary tumor
7315a, while the glucocorticoid agonist/antagonist properties of
the 2 compounds were compared in tumor-bearing animals and
in cultured normal rat pituitary cells.

animals, tumors, and related procedures. female buffalo rats with
a body weight varying between 170 and 190 g were inoculated s.c.
between the scapulae with the acth/prl-secreting
pituitary tumor
7315a (obtained from dr. r. m. macleod, charã¬ottesville,va). five g of
tumor tissue were chopped and minced to a homogeneous solution in
10 ml of 0.9% naci solution (saline), and 0.2 ml of this suspension was
injected. the animals were housed 6/cage under artificial light from 6
a.m. to 7 p.m.
 xxxd2557xxx  (novo industries, bagsvaerd, denmark) or ru
38486 (roussel-uclaf, paris, france) was dissolved in 0.2 ml of peanut

between 9 and 10 a.m. control rats and control tumor-bearing rats
received an injection with oil alone. the administration of the drugs was
started on the third day after tumor implantation, and daily injections
were continued until the animals were killed on day 30.
growth of the transplanted tumors was evaluated by expressing tumor
size in sq cm (maximum length multiplied by maximum width) (12).
control animals without tumors were sacrificed when in diestrus, while
the tumor-bearing and the  xxxd2557xxx - and  xxxd2643xxx -treated rats
did not cycle. control rats with and without tumors and the steroidtreated tumor-bearing rats were sacrificed simultaneously, and the pitu

inhibition of tumor size by 32% (26.8 â±4.5 sq cm versus 45.8
â±4.1 in control tumor-bearing rats; p < 0.01). the weight of the
tumors had significantly decreased both after  xxxd2557xxx 
administration (p < 0.05) and after administration of  xxxd2643xxx 
(p < 0.01) (table 1). body weight (including the tumor) of the 4
groups of rats is shown in table 1. control tumor-bearing rats
and the  xxxd2557xxx -treated rats had significantly lost
weight (after subtracting the tumor weight) when compared with
the nontumor controls (p < 0.01 and p < 0.01, respectively).
however, the body weight (minus tumor weight) of the ru
38486-treated tumor-bearing rats had increased over 30 days to
a similar extent as the non-tumor-bearing controls (table 1). the
inhibition of tumor growth by  xxxd2643xxx  was accompanied by a
significant inhibition of the very high plasma prl and acth
levels (p < 0.01 and p < 0.01 versus tumor controls), white
 xxxd2557xxx  administration had not resulted in changes in
the circulating concentrations of these hormones (table 2).
implantation of the tumor resulted in a diminution of the
anterior pituitary weight in comparison with control non-tumorbearing rats (p < 0.01) (table 1), white the adrenal weights were
greatly elevated (p < 0.01 versus control non-tumor-bearing
rats) (table 1). administration of  xxxd2643xxx  had resulted directly
or indirectly (because of the diminution of tumor size) in a partial
normalization of the diminished anterior pituitary gland weight
and the increased adrenal weight (p < 0.01 and p < 0.01,
respectively, versus tumor controls), while  xxxd2557xxx 
administration did not exert a significant effect (table 1).
the high plasma acth concentration in tumor-bearing control
animals was accompanied by a significant decrease in the total
content of acth of the anterior pituitary glands of these animals
in comparison with those of control rats without tumors (p <
0.01, respectively; table 3). the ability of the pituitary glands of
tumor-bearing control rats to release acth in vitro was also
significantly suppressed (p < 0.01 versus control non-tumorbearing rats; table 3). the ability of the pituitary gland from

tumor-bearing rats to release acth in vitro had increased (p <
0.05) after  xxxd2643xxx  administration and had further diminished
after  xxxd2557xxx  (p < 0.01 ; table 3). the total acth
content of the pituitary glands from tumor control rats had greatly
increased after  xxxd2643xxx  administration (p < 0.01) and further
decreased after  xxxd2557xxx  administration (p < 0.05,
table 3).
in order to further study the differential effects of  xxxd2557xxx 
acetate and  xxxd2643xxx  on acth release, additional experiments
were carried out with cultured normal rat pituitary cells. on day

4,1 nm ovine crf stimulated acth release as measured for 3
hr (p < 0.01 versus control; chart 2a). the simultaneous admin
istration of 1 mmdexamethasone inhibited crf-stimulated acth
release significantly by 37% (p < 0.01), while 1 um  xxxd2557xxx 
acetate and 1 mmru 38486 did not affect crf-stimulated acth
release. preincubation of these 3 steroids for 24 hr, however,
resulted in a complete inhibition of crf-stimulated acth release
by 1 mm dexamethasone and in a 54% inhibition by 1 mm
 xxxd2557xxx  (p < 0.01), while preincubation with 1 mmru
38486 did not affect crf-stimulated acth release (chart 2fi).

(11). in the present study, it was shown that chronic administra
tion of 2.5 mg/kg/day of  xxxd2557xxx  did not inhibit tumor
size as measured at palpation, although the actual tumor weight
had significantly decreased.
after long-term administration of 6-methylated progestins,
some degree of adrenal atrophy has been reported (7, 22). it is
uncertain whether these glucocorticoid-like actions are mediated
by the compounds themselves or by their metabolites (4). in the
present study, we observed a decrease in the ability to release
acth in vitro and in the total acth content of the anterior
pituitary glands of  xxxd2557xxx -treated tumor-bearing rats.

acute exposure of normal cultured pituitary cells to 1 mmmeges
 xxxd3105xxx  acetate did not affect crf-stimulated acth release, but
preincubation of these cells for 24 hr with 1 mmmegestrol acetate
inhibited crf-stimulated acth release by about 50%. this
suggests that 1 ^m  xxxd2557xxx  itself exerts a glucocorti
coid-like effect similar to that of 10 nw dexamethasone (data of
charts 2b and 4 compared). from a clinical point of view, this
glucocorticoid-like effect of  xxxd2557xxx  is of great impor
tance. we recently showed that treatment of 18 patients with
metastatic breast cancer for 6 weeks with either 90,180, or 270
mg of  xxxd2557xxx  daily, completely suppressed the incre
ment in plasma 11-deoxycortisol in response to 4.5 g of  xxxd2633xxx  in 15 or 18 patients, while 3 of the 6 patients taking 90
mg of  xxxd2557xxx  daily showed borderline values (1).
 xxxd2643xxx  turned out to be a compound with activities consid
erably differing from  xxxd2557xxx . it binds at least 5 times
stronger than progesterone to rat ovary progesterone receptors
(20) and exerts an antiprogesterone action on the uterus as it
has been shown to induce abortion in rats, monkeys, and hu
mans by a direct action at the endometrium (8, 10, 20). ru
38486 is also a very potent competitor in glucocorticoid binding
(17). in mouse thymocytes, the compound was shown to coun
teract the dexamethasone-induced inhibition of undine incorpo
ration and cell lysis on a 1- to 3-fold excess basis (6). it has also

of dexamethasone in several other target tissues in vitro as well
in vivo (17, 21). moreover, even after a 4-day treatment of rats,
 xxxd2643xxx  (10 mg/kg/day) exhibited no agonist activity, while the
 xxxg1601xxx  blocking effects were still intact (17).
in the present study, we showed that  xxxd2643xxx  (2.5 mg/kg/

prl and acth levels had significantly decreased. the design of
our study does not allow interpretations on the mechanism of
the effect of  xxxd2643xxx  on the growth of the 7315a tumor. it
cannot be concluded whether it is caused by the antiprogesterone, the antiglucocorticoid, or both effects together. studies with

rats. it cannot be excluded, however, from our studies that ru
38486 exerts a direct adrenal toxic effect, or that prl-mediated
effects play a role in this. at this tumor size (25 sq cm), however,
the acth content of the pituitary gland was shown to be
suppressed to a level similar to that observed in control tumorbearing rats with tumor sizes of more than 40 sq cm. therefore,
the significant increase in the acth content of the pituitary gland
of the  xxxd2643xxx -treated rats should probably be ascribed to the
glucocorticoid-receptor-blocking
effect of  xxxd2643xxx  at the hy
pothalamus and/or pituitary level.
indeed,  xxxd2643xxx  directly exerted a glucocorticoid receptorblocking action on dexamethasone-inhibited
crf-stimulated
acth release by normal cultured rat pituitary cells.  xxxd2643xxx 
did not directly affect crf-stimulated acth release neither after
acute (4 hr) exposure, or after 24-hr preincubation. the ratio of
the concentration of  xxxd2643xxx  needed to completely prevent
the dexamethasone effect is about 100 in the model used by us.
progestins play a central role in the treatment of endometrial
cancer (16) and metastasized breast cancer (2,3,5). apart from
their efficacy, they exert only minor subjective side effects. the
differential effects of the progesterone agonists,  xxxd2557xxx  ace
tate and medroxyprogesterone on the one hand and the proges
terone antagonist  xxxd2643xxx  on the other, on the glucocorticoid
receptor are of more than theoretical value. withdrawal from
long-term treatment with  xxxd2557xxx  and medroxy-progesterone should be carried out very slowly in order to prevent
the occurrence of episodes of adrenocortical insufficiency, while
the institution of therapy with  xxxd2643xxx  might be expected to
be accompanied by signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency.
it is an intriguing but at this stage unsolved question, whether
there will be important differences in the potency of the tumorinhibiting effects of these agents in the treatment of human
cancer. the dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day for the 2 substances that
have been used in the present study was chosen on the basis
of earlier studies in humans (18) and in monkeys (5), but these
dosages do not necessarily represent the optimal choice in the
model studied by us.
