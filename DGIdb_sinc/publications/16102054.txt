summary. post-translational modiﬁcation of glutamate to
gamma carboxyl glutamate is required for the activity of
 xxxd3522xxx -dependent proteins. carboxylation is accomplished
by the enzyme gamma glutamyl carboxylase ( xxxg886xxx ) which
requires the propeptide-containing substrate and three cosubstrates: reduced  xxxd3522xxx , co2, and o2. most propeptides
bind tightly to  xxxg886xxx  and all of the glu residues that will be
modiﬁed are modiﬁed during one binding event. complete
carboxylation is thus dependent upon the rate of carboxylation
and the dissociation rate constant of the substrate from the
 xxxg886xxx  enzyme. if the propeptide is released before carboxylation is complete, partially carboxylated  xxxd3522xxx -dependent
proteins are produced. the rate of carboxylation is mainly
controlled by the level of reduced  xxxd3522xxx  available for the
reactions while the dissociation rate constant is dependent upon
both the propeptide and the gla domain of the substrate. in
addition, there are allosteric eﬀects that increase the rate of
dissociation of the fully carboxylated substrates. carboxylation
requires the abstraction of a proton from the 4-carbon of
glutamate by reduced  xxxd3522xxx  and results in the conversion of
 xxxd3522xxx  to  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide. the  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide must
be recycled to  xxxd3522xxx  before it can be reused, a reaction
catalyzed by the enzyme  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase ( xxxg2418xxx ).
the gene for  xxxg2418xxx  has recently been identiﬁed but the enzyme
itself has not been puriﬁed to homogeneity. it appears, however,
that most of the variability observed in patients response to
warfarin may be attributed to variability in the  xxxg2418xxx  gene.
introduction
dam [1] found that chickens fed a fat-free diet developed a
bleeding diathesis [2]. by 1935 dam had ruled out cholesterol
as the missing factor and named the previously unknown fat
soluble compound  xxxd3522xxx  for koagulation. vitamin k1 was
subsequently isolated from alfafa and vitamin k2 from ﬁsh
meal [3]. vitamin k1 is found mainly in green leafy vegetables
such as kale, spinach, and broccoli while vitamin k2 is found in
liver, milk, cheese, and fermented soy products such as natto.
 xxxd2563xxx  is a chemically synthesized derivative used for
animal feed.

 xxxd3522xxx -dependent proteins require carboxylation for
activity. the amount of  xxxd3522xxx  in the diet is often limiting
for the carboxylation reaction. for example, osteocalcin, or
 xxxg260xxx , is partially carboxylated in normal healthy
volunteers and only becomes fully carboxylated when their diet
is supplemented with  xxxd3522xxx  [4]. it has been commonly
assumed that  xxxd3522xxx  may also be provided by enteric
bacteria; however, if coprophagy is prevented, rats fed a
 xxxd3522xxx -free diet develop severe bleeding problems in weeks
[5,6]. of more interest is the recent observation that vitamin k1
appears to be taken up primarily in the liver while vitamin k2
appears to preferentially accumulate in arteries and extra
hepatic locations [5,6].
until recently, it was thought that the only function of
 xxxd3522xxx  was to act as a co-substrate for carboxylation of the
 xxxd3522xxx -dependent proteins. although it was known that
vitamin k2 promoted bone formation, it was assumed that its
function was solely through its action on the gla proteins
osteocalcin and matrix gla protein [7,8]. recently, however, it
has been reported that vitamin k2 can directly stimulate
mrna production of osteoblast mrna markers and that
vitamin k2 is a transcriptional regulator of bone-speciﬁc genes
[9].
the known  xxxd3522xxx -dependent proteins include coagulation factors vii, ix, x, prothrombin, protein z,  xxxg1850xxx  and
protein c. gas 6 (which functions as a ligand for the axl family
of  xxxg2198xxx  receptors), the bone-related proteins (osteocalcin and matrix gla protein), and four integral membrane
proteins of unknown function are also gla proteins [10]. the
importance of the gla-containing proteins of the coagulation
cascade is obvious. the observation that a knockout of matrix
gla proteins leads to complete calciﬁcation of the arteries by
2 months of age [11] indicates the importance of gla proteins
other than coagulation factors.
the enzyme that modiﬁes the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent proteins
is the  xxxg886xxx  ( xxxg886xxx ). the
carboxylated glu residue is referred to as a gla amino acid
and, concomitant with gla modiﬁcation, a reduced  xxxd3522xxx 
molecule is converted to  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide. before it can be
reused, this  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide must be converted back to
reduced  xxxd3522xxx  by the  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase
( xxxg2418xxx ). the  xxxd3522xxx  cycle is depicted in fig. 1. it is not
clear if  xxxg2418xxx  itself catalyzes the conversion of  xxxd3522xxx  to
reduced  xxxd3522xxx  or if this is accomplished by a separate
enzyme. however, patients poisoned with warfarin or

k to reduced  xxxd3522xxx .
carboxylation
 xxxd3522xxx -dependent  xxxg886xxx  is a 758 amino acid integral
membrane protein with ﬁve transmembrane domains (fig. 2)
[12]. it has one disulﬁde bond between residues 99 and 450 [13].
its activity was discovered in 1975 [14] and it was puriﬁed and
cloned in 1991 [15,16]. the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent protein
substrates of carboxylase all have a propeptide (in the case of
matrix gla protein, this propeptide is internal and not removed)

that binds to an exocyte on  xxxg886xxx . co2, o2, and reduced
 xxxd3522xxx  are co-substrates. for each glutamate carboxylated,
a molecule of  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide is formed. an elegant theory
of how carboxylation occurs, based upon model chemical
reactions, was proposed by dowd [17]. he proposed a base
strength ampliﬁcation sequence in which reduced  xxxd3522xxx  is
transformed to a strong base. this strong base then abstracts a
proton from selected glutamates in the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent
proteins. his theory is, in part, based on the assumption that
cysteines are the active site residues. however, we and others
have shown that it is unlikely that cysteines are active site
residues [13,18,19]. dowd chose cysteine as the active site
residue because the carboxylase reaction is inhibited by
sulfhydryl-speciﬁc reagents. however, his base strength ampliﬁcation mechanism does not depend on the active site being a
cysteine. the base strength ampliﬁcation mechanism is still
viable except the active site residue must be changed to an
amino acid such as histidine or tyrosine, etc.
our current theory on how carboxylation occurs is that the
substrate binds to the carboxylase primarily through its
propeptide. the binding is relatively tight and all of the
carboxylations (that are to occur for a given substrate) occur
during a single binding event [20]. thus, when a kinetic time
course experiment is run in the presence of a large excess of a
substrate that includes the propeptide and gla domain of
human  xxxg752xxx , a burst phase followed by a prolonged steady
state is observed (fig. 3). the slower steady-state rate constant
corresponds to the release of the fully carboxylated vitamin kdependent substrate from the  xxxg886xxx . this is indicated by the
observation that the steady-state rate constant, 4.5 · 10)4 s)1,
is nearly identical to the dissociation rate constant of a fully
 2005 international society on thrombosis and haemostasis

the  xxxd3522xxx  cycle 1875

carboxylation is determined by the relative rate of carboxylation, itself dependent upon the level of  xxxd3522xxx  available, and
the dissociation rate of the substrate from the carboxylase.

our conclusions from the in-vitro data are consistent with
several observations drawn from experiments in cells and from
patients. first, only 30% of  xxxg741xxx  produced in hek 293 cell
culture is fully carboxylated while 70% is not carboxylated at
all. because  xxxg741xxx  has the tightest binding propeptide of any
known gla protein, we postulated that reducing the afﬁnity of
the propeptide should increase the turnover rate and lead to
more complete carboxylation provided that the afﬁnity is not
so reduced that premature release of the substrate occurs.
therefore, we replaced  xxxg741xxx ’s propeptide with that of
prothrombin, whose afﬁnity is about 50 times less than that of
 xxxg741xxx . this led to dramatically improved carboxylation with
90–95% of  xxxg741xxx  being fully carboxylated [21]. secondly, we
found a patient that had a mutation in his fix propeptide that
affected carboxylation. this patient was normal until it was
necessary for him to undergo warfarin therapy whereupon he
developed a  xxxg752xxx  phenotype [22]. when his  xxxg752xxx 
gene was sequenced it was found to have a propeptide
mutation (a-10t) that resulted in an 11-fold decrease in its
afﬁnity for  xxxg886xxx  [23]. this can be rationalized to ﬁt our
kinetic data by assuming that the rate of carboxylation is
reduced because of low  xxxd3522xxx  concentrations during
warfarin therapy and that given the reduced afﬁnity of his
propeptide, his  xxxg752xxx  dissociates from  xxxg886xxx  before
carboxylation is complete. the third example that is consistent
with our theory is that osteocalcin from ostensibly normal
volunteers is partially carboxylated but becomes fully carboxylated when  xxxd3522xxx  supplements are given. the propeptide
of osteocalcin has the lowest afﬁnity of any of the known
 xxxd3522xxx -dependent proteins. although osteocalcin’s gla
domain has a relatively high afﬁnity for  xxxg886xxx , we assume
that the low afﬁnity of the propeptide combined with less than
optimal  xxxd3522xxx  concentration allows the osteocalcin to
dissociate before carboxylation is complete [4] and that the
higher  xxxd3522xxx  concentration stimulates the rate of carboxylation.

 xxxg752xxx  substrate, 12 co2 molecules) and is fast compared to
the release of the carboxylated substrate. therefore, the extent
of the burst should correspond to the enzyme concentration
multiplied by the number of gla’s modiﬁed (12). the
experimental agreement between the intercept and the concentration of active enzyme calculated independently is remarkably good. the rate of incorporation during the burst phase is
calculated to be 0.016 s)1. this agrees well, as it should, with
the rate of calculation calculated from an enzyme excess
experiment, 0.02 s)1 (fig. 4). the results shown in fig. 4 reveal
that the rate is linear up to 10 glas per molecule and then slows
for the addition of the last two co2 molecules. incidentally,
only 10  xxxg752xxx  glas are required for full activity. we
conclude from these in-vitro experiments that a substrate binds
to the carboxylase by its propeptide and that, while bound, all
glu’s that will be modiﬁed are modiﬁed. the extent of

the enzyme responsible for the regeneration of  xxxd3522xxx 
from  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide is  xxxg2418xxx . this activity was ﬁrst
reported in 1970 [24] but it proved refractory to puriﬁcation
for more than 30 years. in the february 5th 2004 issue of
nature, the identiﬁcation of the gene that codes for epoxide
reductase was identiﬁed by both my laboratory [25] and that of
oldenburg [26]. the epoxide reductase is encoded in about
5 kb of dna on human chromosome 16. there are several
alternative splice variants but the cdna encoding the
enzymatic activity may be found at the ncbi web site under
the designation ay521634.

fig. 5. topology of  xxxg2418xxx : the amino terminus resides in the er lumen and the carboxy terminus resides in the cytoplasm.

the  xxxg2418xxx  protein is 163 amino acids in length and is an
integral membrane protein with three transmembrane domains
(fig. 5). the amino terminus is located in the lumen of the
endoplasmic reticulum and the carboxy-terminus is exposed to
the cytoplasm. there is a cxxc motif that is characteristic of
the active site of many redox proteins. in the case of the cxxc
motif in the epoxide reductase, it is unclear at this stage if it is
the active site but it is a high probability target and the
mutation of either of the cysteine residues in the cxxc motif
results in loss of activity (unpublished results).
does the enzyme that we isolated encode complete  xxxg2418xxx 
activity or is there an as yet unidentiﬁed subunit of a larger
complex? rost et al. [26] assume that there are other
components of the reductase system. their conclusion appears
to be based upon the reports of wallin [27,28] that microsomal
epoxide hydrolase and  xxxg1073xxx  are likely
components of a  xxxg2418xxx  complex. however, a knockout of
mouse microsomal epoxide hydrolase exhibited no abnormal
phenotype [29]. moreover, there is no further evidence that
 xxxg1073xxx  is a component of  xxxg2418xxx  activity.
furthermore, all known mutations that affect vitamin kdependent carboxylation can be assigned to either  xxxg2418xxx  or
 xxxg886xxx  [26,30]. a further reason for invoking additional
components of a  xxxg2418xxx  complex is that enzyme activity is lost
when the activity is solubilized with detergents. our observation (that the cxxc motif lies within a transmembrane helix)
may explain the loss of enzyme activity because the helix would

presumably require a membrane for its proper structure. thus,
there is no compelling evidence that the  xxxg2418xxx  enzyme is a
complex. nevertheless, if the active site of  xxxg2418xxx  does include
the cxxc motif, then it is probable that another enzyme
similar to the  xxxg1826xxx  (that reduces thioredoxin
in escherichia coli) will be needed to complete the cycle.
 xxxg641xxx  [31], reduced thioredoxin [32], and protein
disulﬁde isomerase [33] all support  xxxg2418xxx  activity when added
to microsomes.
practical consequences
in the united states alone, warfarin is prescribed to more than
one million patients per year. because the dose of warfarin
required for a therapeutic level of anticoagulation varies greatly
among patients, the utilization of warfarin is accompanied by a
signiﬁcant risk of side effects. for example, it has been reported
that, following initiation of warfarin therapy major bleeding
episodes occurred in 12% of patients and 2% of these patients
died [34]. in spite of this, it has been estimated that warfarin use
can prevent 20 strokes per induced bleeding episode [35]. thus,
there has been considerable interest in developing new oral
anticoagulants that might have all of the positive beneﬁts
without the potential side effects. alternatively, modifying
warfarin therapy to reduce the side effects is appealing,
especially as warfarin remains the drug of choice. warfarin
therapy commonly uses a racemic mixture of warfarin, with

each side of the horizontal line that deﬁnes the median.

 xxxd990xxx  being the most effective enantiomer.  xxxd990xxx  is
degraded by  xxxg587xxx . single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) of this cytochrome have been shown to
correlate with the dose of warfarin required for effective
anticoagulation [36,37]. other factors that affect warfarin dose
may be attributed to variability in the gene for  xxxg2418xxx  itself.
for example, rost et al. [26] found a patient with the  xxxg2418xxx 
mutation r98w that had reduced  xxxg2418xxx  activity. they also
found that mutations r58g, v29l, v45a, and l128r resulted
in warfarin resistance. in addition, they found that a rat with
warfarin resistance had the  xxxg2418xxx  mutation y139c. in an
attempt to correlate warfarin dose with  xxxg2418xxx  polymorphisms, we sequenced the genes of 58 patients undergoing
warfarin therapy at the university of north carolina. of the
polymorphisms found in these patients, three correlated with
the patientsõ average warfarin dose. in the same patients, we
also determined if snps *2 or *3 of  xxxg587xxx  were
present. those patients with p450 2c9*2 or p450 2c9*3
appeared to correlate with the dose of warfarin required, but
the frequency of their occurrence was much lower than the
frequency of  xxxg2418xxx  polymorphisms; therefore, patients with
both a cytochrome p450 and  xxxg2418xxx  polymorphism were
excluded from the data shown in fig. 6. in the patients that we
examined 13% were homozygous for both nucleotides 4769
(g>a) and 3294 (t>c) and 13% were homozygous for the
nucleotide 2581 (g>c) polymorphism. the p-value for the
differences in the two populations was 0.000075. there were no
patients that did not have at least one of the three polymorphic
markers.
how might one improve current therapy? one way is to
screen for the polymorphisms that affect warfarin dosage and
adjust the dosage appropriately. this should help with some of
the extreme levels of dosage and would be particularly helpful
at the onset of treatment. in addition, part of the variability in a
single patient’s response to warfarin over time probably arises
from variation in the dietary intake of  xxxd3522xxx . it seems
logical, therefore, that dosing patients with warfarin and
 2005 international society on thrombosis and haemostasis

 xxxd3522xxx  simultaneously should buffer this variation. the
problem with using vitamin k1 as a buffer is that a regimen of
warfarin + vitamin k1 is the procedure used by price to
stimulate arterial calciﬁcation in rats [38]. vermeer’s laboratory
repeated price’s experiments with warfarin and vitamin k1.
however, when the rats were fed warfarin and vitamin k2, no
arterial calciﬁcation was observed [5]. as mentioned above,
vitamin k2 is preferentially taken up in non-liver tissues.
nonetheless, it can be used by the liver to carboxylate the
 xxxd3522xxx -dependent proteins and levels of anticoagulation
can be achieved that should provide satisfactory therapeutic
results.
in summary, we have made a good start in understanding
the mechanism of carboxylation. our experimental results are
at least consistent with observations of patients undergoing
warfarin therapy that had propeptide mutations and with
results from cell culture experiments. our studies on the
epoxide reductase are in their initial phases. the most critical
problem is to purify the protein to homogeneity. this will allow
us to determine if  xxxg2418xxx  is a single enzyme or an enzyme
complex. it will also allow us to initiate studies on the
enzymatic mechanism of  xxxg2418xxx . we are encouraged with our
initial progress and expect to have considerably more information within the next few years.
