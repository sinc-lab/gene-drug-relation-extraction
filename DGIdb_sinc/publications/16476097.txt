summary. acquired haemophilia is a rare bleeding
disorder caused by autoimmune antibodies interacting with factor viii ( xxxg751xxx ) or  xxxg752xxx . anticipating
a high degree of heterogeneity amongst cases, we
recently initiated systematic recording of whole
blood (wb) coagulation dynamic profiles using our
recently developed thrombelastographic method
employing very small amounts of  xxxg748xxx  for
activation. six newly diagnosed patients with
acquired haemophilia a in our university hospital
were investigated with the purpose to characterize
the wb clotting phenotypes in each patient, as well
as inspecting the ex vivo and in vivo response to
supplementation with various haemostatic agents.
our results show a striking heterogeneity in patients
wb clotting profiles, each patient having a particular
pattern and an individual type of response to
bypassing agents. profiles in some of patients resembled severe haemophilia a, even if there was a
measurable residual  xxxg751xxx :c activity while others
were more similar moderate-to-mild haemophilia. in

introduction
acquired haemophilia is a rare autoimmune disease
most often caused by the development of autoantibodies against factor viii:c ( xxxg751xxx :c). the annual
incidence is 1.3 cases per million inhabitants [1]. the
disease is most often detected amongst elderly
persons at a median age of about 65 years during
presentation [1–3]. roughly half of the cases appear
to be idiopathic. commonly recognized secondary

one case the profile was very close to normal. each
patient seemed to respond individually to bypassing
agents. wb clotting profiles assisted us in selecting an
optimal treatment modality in each case and whenever possible, we compared the clinical effects of the
treatment selected with the appearance of the wb
clotting pattern. in one patient, the ex vivo response
to  xxxg751xxx  looked promising, and a approximately
200 iu kg)1 per 24 h high-dose programme nearly
normalized the clotting profile in 2-week time. our
preliminary small series of data should be concluded
with caution. however, it seems that wb clotting
profile studies at baseline, with ex vivo addition of
haemostasis promoting agents, and during treatment
may hold the potential to predict the success of
treatment.

aetiologies comprise malignancies, various autoimmune diseases, pregnancy and intolerance to drug
therapy [4]. acquired haemophilia is a potentially
hazardous disease in which 80–90% of the patients
experience severe bleeding episodes with a shortterm mortality rate of up to 10–20% [5–7].
the suspicion of acquired haemophilia a is usually
raised when an unexpected bleeding tendency occurs
in a patient with no previous history of abnormal
bleeding propensity. major laboratory findings comprises a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin
time (aptt) together with a significantly lowered
 xxxg751xxx :c activity, and detectable inhibitory  xxxg751xxx :c
autoantibodies by the bethesda assay. in patients presenting with major bleeding, an early diagnosis and
institution of treatment are important for a successful outcome [2,8]. the haemostatic armamentarium

includes desmopressin, high-dose  xxxg751xxx , and socalled bypassing agents like activated prothrombin
complex concentrates (apcc) and recombinant
activated  xxxg750xxx  (rfviia). determining the most
favourable haemostatic treatment in each individual
case constitutes a quite complex clinical challenge,
and because of the scarcity of cases, no prospective
randomized controlled trials are available to guide
haemostatic therapy in the individual patient. furthermore, acquired haemophilia a appears to be a
quite heterogeneous disorder, and an optimal medication in one patient may not prove equally beneficial in other patients. apparently, the aptt and the
titre of  xxxg751xxx :c autoantibodies are associated only
weakly with the severity of bleeding [1–4,8,9], and
therefore provide limited help for optimizing haemostatic therapy.
recently published studies carried out in our
laboratory have demonstrated that a dynamic whole
blood (wb) coagulation profile, as recorded by
thrombelastography employing a small amount of
 xxxg748xxx , holds the potential to detect a variety of
haemostatic dysfunctions, including haemophilia
[10]. moreover, our investigations have illustrated
an interperson variance in the wb clotting profiles
that may reflect heterogeneity in the severity of an
otherwise identical haemostatic disorder [11]. furthermore, the wb coagulation model has proved
useful in the assessment of haemostatic capacity of
bypassing agents as well as in other therapeutic
interventions [10,12,13].
in consequence of our previous results, we adopted
the thrombelastographic method in the study of
patients with acquired haemophilia a. we hypothes-

191

ized that profiles of dynamic wb clot formation
might be useful in the characterization of haemostatic phenotype in such patients. secondarily, we
hypothesized that experiments with ex vivo titration
of patient’s blood with clotting factors such as
recombinant factor viii (rfviii), rfviia or apcc,
utilizing thrombelastographic analysis, might assist
in selecting the most optimal haemostatic therapy.

materials and methods
patients
the study included six patients, four females and two
males, with an average age of 64 years (range 33–
84 years). all patients were diagnosed with acquired
haemophilia following admission to our haemophilia
centre during the period from january 2003 to
february 2005. patient demographic data and results
of routine laboratory tests are listed in table 1.
case descriptions
the first patient of this series (case 1) presented with
spontaneous muscle bleeding and haematuria, while a
second patient (case 2) was admitted due to monosymptomatic haematuria. the results of a computed
tomography scan had raised suspicion of a kidney
tumour and nephrectomy was performed at the local
hospital, showing the absence of tumour but only
large amounts of partly clotted blood in the renal
calyx. there was serious postoperative bleeding
and a reoperation was performed with no effect on
the haemorrhage. following 2 weeks of continued

bleeding requiring excessive amounts of blood transfusion, the diagnosis of acquired haemophilia was
made. a third patient (case 3) initially presented with
dramatic postpartum haemorrhages following a caesarian section. because of persistent oozing, reoperation, curettage, laparoscopia and eventually ligation
of the uterine artery was carried out so as to achieve
haemostasis. only 20 days later the aid of the
haemostasis laboratory was requested, and a postpartum-acquired haemophilia diagnosis was established. the fourth patient (case 4) suffered from
massive subcutaneous bleeding before diagnosis. the
fifth patient (case 5) was admitted because of haematuria. cystoscopy caused severe bleeding, and suspicion was raised that the endoscopic procedure had
caused a perforation of the urinary bladder. the
patient developed a large retro-peritoneal haematoma
causing compression of the upper urinary tract.
laparotomy was performed following which extensive oozing emerged and massive blood transfusion
therapy was required. case 6 presented with moderate
haematuria, painful swelling of the left leg and a
muscle haematoma of the arm. initially the patient
was suspected of thrombosis. however, laboratory
investigation revealed signs of a low titre  xxxg751xxx :c
antibody.
blood samples
blood samples were drawn into citrated venoject
tubes (0.129 mol l)1: 3.8 w/v%; terumo europe,
leuven, belgium) mixing one part of citrate with
nine parts of blood, employing minimum stasis and a
21-g butterfly needle (terumo europe nv, leuven,
beligum), discarding the first tube aspirated. the
blood sample for the wb thrombelastographic analysis was rested for 30 min at room temperature.
ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid stabilized blood
was used for automated blood cell counts.
thrombelastographic continuous wb coagulation
analyses
continuous wb clot formation was recorded by a
rotem thrombelastography coagulation analyser (pentapharm, münich, germany) consistent
with our method as described elsewhere [14]. in
brief, the citrated wb rested for 30 min at ambient
temperature. the thrombelastographic analysis was
performed by incubating 300 ll of blood mixture
with 20 ll of human recombinant  xxxg748xxx  (tf)
dilution (innovin) giving a final reaction mixture
concentration of tf at approximately 0.35 pmol l)1
(final dilution 1:17 000). coagulation was initiated
haemophilia (2006), 12, 190–197

by the addition of 20 ll of 200 mm cacl2 and all
analyses were processed in duplicate and recordings
were allowed to proceed for at least 90 min. the
digital signal from the rotem analyser was
imported into a software program (dycoderivantm; avordusol, risskov, denmark) that provides
dynamic velocity profiles of coagulation as well as
parameters:
maximum
velocity
(maxvel;
mm*100 s)1) of clot formation and the time to
maxvel (t, maxvel; s).
ex vivo intervention experiments were performed
by spiking wb with buffer (20 ll), rfviia (novoseven; novo nordisk, bagsvaerd, denmark),
apcc (feiba; baxter, deerfield, il, usa) or
human rfviii concentrate, as reported in respective
legends to figures.
plasma coagulation analyses
determination of  xxxg751xxx :c were performed by a onestage method utilizing platelin ls (organon teknika, turnhout, belgium) as activator and a natural
haemophilic  xxxg751xxx  deficiency plasma as test base.
prothrombin time, aptt, thrombin time (tt), and
the level of functional fibrinogen were analysed
employing recombinant human tf (innovin),
aptt test reagent (platelin ls), bovine thrombin
(bc thrombin reagent), and a fibrinogen test
reagent (multifibren u) respectively. all reagents
and the bct analyser were purchased from dade
behring (marburg, germany).

phenotypes of wb clot formation
in these six cases, the continuous wb clot formation
revealed considerable heterogeneity ranging from
clotting patterns almost indistinguishable from
healthy individuals as previously reported [10] to
profiles characterized by a marked prolongation of
the initiation phase of coagulation as well as a
considerable reduction in clot propagation as illustrated in figs 1 and 2 [the phenotypes are seen as
solid line curves (buffer)].

of rfviia revealed a coagulation signature similar
to that obtained from the ex vivo spiking experiments. in case 2, ex vivo experiments with rfviia and
apcc revealed only modest improvements with
either agents (fig. 1b), with a slightly better response
to apcc when compared to that obtained with
rfviia. the clinical improvement of haemostasis by
apcc in vivo was quite satisfying, but blood components like  xxxd187xxx , fresh frozen plasma and
platelets were also administered concomitantly. in
case 3, rfviia induced a small but distinct improvement in the coagulation profile ex vivo (fig. 1c).
based on the clinical status of the patient, and the
favourable phenotype of wb coagulation dynamics at
baseline, no haemostatic intervention other than
tranexamid acid appeared to be necessary. in case
4, ex vivo titration studies with rfviia revealed a
dose-dependent improvement of the coagulation
haemophilia (2006), 12, 190–197

profile (fig. 1d), but rfviia treatment was never
requested. in case 5, ex vivo titration studies were
performed using rfviii, apcc and rfviia (fig. 1e).
although in this case apcc failed to normalize the
clotting profile, it seemed more favourable compared
with rfviia. noticeably, however, following in vivo
infusion of two platelet pools and 60 lg kg)1 rfviia
on day 3, the wb coagulation profile changed to one
indistinguishable from that of a normal person
(fig. 2). in vivo infusion of rfviii induced improvements of the clotting signature similar to the effect
recorded ex vivo. further, in case 5 in vivo wb tests
were processed on days 1, 2, 3, 5 and 15 during
hospitalization before and after rfviii administration
(fig. 2). during the first days of hospitalization
there was only limited variation in the wb clotting
profile. when comparing data obtained at the day of

charge, a significantly improved clot signature was
seen before as well as after infusion of rfviii. in case
6 the admission blood sample was tested for its
response to rfviii, rfviia and apcc. as rfviii
concentrate improved the clotting profile most significantly,  xxxg751xxx  concentrate was selected for treatment.
the in vivo profile before and after rfviii infusion
had a slightly different configuration from the one
found ex vivo, but still with a distinct response to
rfviii.

discussion
acquired haemophilia a is characterized by a vast
heterogeneity in its clinical manifestations. variable
and quite unpredictable bleeding problems may
occur, and management of haemostasis is often a
matter of trial and error. in control of bleeding,
 xxxd1847xxx  ( xxxd1847xxx ) and exogenous  xxxg751xxx 
in extraordinary amounts may be tried in some
patients with low titre inhibitors, but often these
remedies fail to provide haemostasis. inhibitor
bypassing agents such as apcc and rfviia seem to
be more effective in control of bleeding, but no

laboratory test exists that can securely predict and
monitor the efficacy of treatment. hence, the seriously bleeding patient with acquired haemophilia
constitutes a major clinical and therapeutical dilemma. laboratory tests are highly demanded that may
accurately assess the individual degree of dysfunction
of haemostasis. furthermore, such tests should also
be applicable in ex vivo estimation of the effect of
various haemostatic interventions applied on patient
blood to facilitate optimized management of
bleeding.
patients from our small series presented with a
quite large variation at baseline. among patients,
some displayed a seriously compromised wb clotting
function, quite similar to that seen in congenital
haemophilia with inhibitors [10], while others were
less seriously affected. we found an overwhelming
heterogeneity in the dynamic profiles of wb coagulation in these patients, which only weakly correlated
to the aptt, the titre of autoantibodies or the
residual  xxxg751xxx  activity. for instance, the wb coagulation profile in case 2 were strongly suppressed
when compared with case 1, even though other
coagulation parameters were quite similar.

profiles shifted in the direction of improved haemostatic capacity. the ex vivo effects were dependent
on the type of factor concentrate as well as the test
dose. the ex vivo response to various haemostatic
agents varied greatly from patient to patient, illustrating heterogeneity in response to therapy.
we found that cases 2 and 5 responded most
favourably to apcc when compared with rfviia,
even though rfviia has been quite successful in
restoring haemostasis in some studies [7]. it is
possible that the poor response to rfviia was due
to pre-existing thrombocytopenia in these patients.
in accord with the reported experience that the
function of rfviia is dependent on the platelet count
[13], platelet transfusion together with rfviia normalized the profile of wb coagulation.
when results of the ex vivo investigation were
utilized in the choice of in vivo administration of the
selected therapy, the in vivo profile corresponded
quite closely to the predicted. in case 5 the profiles
recorded before and after  xxxg751xxx  treatment were
highly reproducible from day to day. when comparing the profiles of case 5 during the first day of
admission to the one obtained at discharge (day 15)
the latter set of profiles showed considerable
improvement. we suspect this to be caused by
immune tolerance induction by the high-dose  xxxg751xxx 
treatment. these results suggest that the ex vivo tests
may predict patient’s response to treatment in vivo.
in addition, such observations point to the likelihood
that the thrombelastographic analysis actually mirrors the haemostatic properties of the blood.
our limited data should be interpreted with
caution, in particular, because the thrombelastographic analysis of wb coagulation is adopted here
for the first time in the study of acquired haemophilia. our main findings have been that heterogeneity
exists in the phenotype of acquired haemophilia as
well as in its response to treatment. ex vivo
supplementation and in vivo treatment with same
haemostatic agent resulted in highly comparable
response patterns. in consequence, we believe that ex
vivo thrombelastographic wb coagulation analysis is
a promising tool that may assist in selecting the
optimal haemostatic treatment and dosage in
acquired haemophilia. the thrombelastographic analysis may even be useful in the study of larger groups
of patients in controlled clinical trials.
