abstract here, we used a reductant, n- xxxd68xxx 
(nac), to investigate the redox-sensitive step(s) in the signalling
pathway from the  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf) receptor to
nuclear factor ub (nf-u
ub). we found that nac suppressed nfub activation triggered by tnf or by overexpression of either
the tnf receptor-associated death domain protein, tnf
receptor-associated factor 2, nf-u
ub-inducing kinase (nik), or
iu
ub kinases (ikkk
k and ikkl
l). nac also suppressed the tnfinduced activation of ikkk
k and ikkl
l, phosphorylation and
degradation of iu
ub, and nuclear translocation of nf-u
ub.
furthermore, nac suppressed the activation of ikkk
k and
ikkl
l triggered by the overexpression of nik. these results
indicate that ikkk
k and ikkl
l are subject to redox regulation in
the cells, and that nac inhibits nf-u
ub activation through the
suppression of these kinases.

1. introduction
cells produce reactive oxygen radicals (ros), such as o3
2 ,
h2 o2 , and oh , through metabolic pathways, including that
of the electron transport reaction in mitochondria. several
environmental stimuli, such as uv light and q-ray irradiation,
also generate ros in cells. cells possess several antioxidant
systems, including cellular reductants, such as glutathione
(gsh), and cellular antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase,
which act against oxidative radical stress. regulation of the
cellular redox state is crucial for cell survival, and disturbance
of this by increased levels of ros induces cell death by necrosis and/or apoptosis. recent studies have revealed that
regulation of the cellular redox state plays an important role
not only in cell survival, but also in cellular signalling systems
linked to cell growth and cell diÂ¡erentiation [1^4].

heterodimeric transcription factor, nf-ub, which is composed
of two proteins, p65 (rela) and p50 (nf-ub1) [5^7]. in the
unstimulated state, nf-ub is bound to an inhibitory protein,
iub, which regulates the dna binding and intracellular localization of nf-ub [5^7]. upon binding of tnf to its receptors
on the cell membrane, the signal is transduced through the
tnf receptor-associated death domain protein (tradd) [8],
tnf-receptor associated factor 2 (traf2) [9], and nf-ubinducing kinase (nik) [10], and then activates iub kinases
(ikkk and ikkl) [11^15]. the activated ikkk and ikkl
phosphorylate serine residues in the n-terminal region of iub,
which, in turn, induces the degradation of iub by proteasomes
[11^15]. this sequential reaction Â¢nally results in the release of
nf-ub from iub, allowing the activated nf-ub to enter the
nucleus and promote gene transcription. as well as tnf,
several extracellular stimuli, including oxidative radical stress,
activate nf-ub [16^19]. furthermore, it has been reported
that antioxidants, such as n- xxxd68xxx  (nac) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (pdtc), suppress the tnf-induced
nf-ub activation in the cells, indicating that the activation of
nf-ub is subject to redox regulation [18^21].
nac is a unique compound which acts as a reductant both
by its own reducing power and by stimulating the synthesis of
the major cellular reductant gsh [22]. it has been shown that
this compound has a wide range of biological eÂ¡ects on cells.
nac inhibits apoptosis induced by oxidative radical stress,
deprivation of growth factors or a variety of cytotoxic drugs
[23^26]. nac also stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinase
(mapk) through an upstream signalling molecule, ras
[26,27], which has been revealed to be involved in its antiapoptotic eÂ¡ects [26]. conversely, nac uncouples the signal
transduction from ras to the mapk cascade in rat pheochromocytoma pc12 cells when the cells are stimulated by nerve
growth factor [28]. although it is still unclear how nac elicits
these biological eÂ¡ects, its ability to modulate a variety of
cellular functions indicates that intracellular signalling systems
are subjected to redox regulation. regarding the nf-ub signalling pathway, nac suppresses the activation of nf-ub
induced by tnf, and several extracellular stimuli, including
oxidative radical stress and lipopolysaccharide [18,29]. nf-ub
itself is a redox-sensitive transcription factor whose dna
binding activity is suppressed by oxidation, and which is activated by reduction in vitro [30^32]. thus, the ability of nac
to suppress nf-ub in vivo indicates that the upstream signalling pathway to nf-ub, at least, is subject to redox regulation. however, it remains unclear which step(s) of the signal
transduction pathway is suppressed by nac. identiÂ¢cation of
the nac-sensitive step(s) will provide a pivotal clue to the
molecular mechanism of redox regulation in cellular signalling
systems. here, we investigated the eÂ¡ects of nac on the

pharmacia), and then the bacterially expressed gst fusion iubk(1^
55) proteins were puriÂ¢ed using gsh-sepharose (amersham pharmacia). expression plasmids of tradd (prk-myc-tradd), traf2

was a kind gift from dr. makoto nakanishi (nagoya city university)
expression plasmids of hemagglutinin (ha)-tagged ikkk (prk-haikkk) and ikkl (prk-ha-ikkl) were generated by ligation of
plasmids encoding the ha epitope (mypydvpdya) to the dna
fragments of ikkk and ikkl, respectively. a luciferase reporter
plasmid of nf-ub, pig3luc, encodes the triple nf-ub binding sites
(agcttcagaggggactttccgagagg) upstream of the luciferase gene in picca gene enhancer vector (toyo b-net co., japan).
2.2. cell culture
hela cells were cultured in dulbecco's modiÂ¢ed eagle's medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 wg/ml kanamycin
at 37Â³c in 5% co2 in air.
2.3. luciferase gene reporter assay
hela cells (2u105 cells per 35 mm dish) were transfected with

pig3luc using lipofectin (gibco brl). after 24 h, the luciferase
activity was determined using the luciferase assay system (promega)
and normalized by the protein content in each sample.
2.4. gsh assay
the cells were collected and suspended in ice-cold phosphate-buÂ¡ered saline (pbs). an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid (tca)
was then added to the cell suspension and the mixture was centrifuged
(20 000ug for 10 min) at 4Â³c. the supernatant was extracted with six
volumes of diethylether six times to remove the tca. the resulting
extract was incubated with 200 wm nadph and gsh reductase
(1 u/ml) for 10 min at 37Â³c, and then the gsh level was measured
by 1 mm dtnb. the reaction was monitored by the absorbance
change at 415 nm.
2.5. kinase assays for ikkk and ikkl
hela cells (2u105 cells per 35 mm dish) were transfected with
plasmids encoding flag-tagged ikkk or ha-tagged ikkl by lipofectin. then the cells were solubilized in a buÂ¡er containing 20 mm
tris^hcl, ph 7.4, 10 mm egta, 10 mm mgcl2 , 1 mm  xxxd302xxx , 60 mm l-glycerophosphate, 1 mm na3 vo4 , 20 mm naf, 1 mm
apmsf, 50 u/ml aprotinin, 20 wg/ml pepstatin, 20 wg/ml leupeptin,
1 mm dithiothreitol (dtt), and 1% triton x-100, and then centrifuged at 15 000ug for 20 min. the expressed flag-ikkk and haikkl were recovered from the lysates by immunoprecipitation using
anti-flag antibody aÂ¤nity resin or anti-ha polyclonal antibody, respectively. then the immune complexes were incubated with 10 wl
reaction buÂ¡er containing 20 mm hepes^naoh, ph 7.4, 10 mm
mgcl2 , 50 mm nacl, 100 wm na3 vo4 , 20 mm l-glycerophosphate,
1 mm dtt, 100 wm atp, 0.05 wci [q-32 p]atp, 5 wg gst^iubk(1^
55) at 30Â³c for 20 min. after sds^page, the phosphorylation of
gst-iubk was estimated by imaging plate (fuji film).
2.6. western blot analysis
cell lysates were fractionated by sds^page, and then transferred
to ecl membrane (amersham pharmacia). western blot analysis was
performed using a western blotting detection system (amersham
pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2.7. immunoÂ£uorescent cell staining
hela cells grown on coverslips were washed with 0.1 m potassium
phosphate buÂ¡er (ph 7.4) and Â¢xed with 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 m
potassium phosphate buÂ¡er (ph 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature.

3. results
3.1. dtt and nac suppress tnf-induced nf-ub activation
the luciferase gene reporter assay revealed that tnf-induced nf-ub activation in hela cells was suppressed by
nac in a dose-dependent manner. another reductant,

dtt, also suppressed nf-ub activation, while n-acetylalanine (naa) failed to inhibit it (fig. 1a), indicating that a
thiol residue on nac is required for the suppression of nfub. it is known that nac stimulates the metabolic production of the major cellular reductant gsh in cells [22]. indeed,
cellular gsh levels were increased when cells were treated
with 30 mm nac for 5 h (fig. 1b). to elucidate whether
the increase in gsh was involved in the inhibitory eÂ¡ects of
nac, bso, a speciÂ¢c inhibitor of gsh synthesis, was added
to abolish the increase in gsh. treatment of the cells with
bso completely inhibited the increase in cellular gsh (fig.

fig. 3. nac inhibits nuclear translocation of nf-ub. the cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 30 mm nac for 1 h, and then
stimulated with 20 ng/ml tnf. after 30 min tnf stimulation, the cells were Â¢xed and stained with anti-p65 or anti-p50 antibodies, and then
analyzed by immunoÂ£uorescence microscopy.

1b). in these bso-treated cells, nac eÂ¡ectively suppressed
tnf-induced nf-ub activation, indicating that nac inhibits
nf-ub activation irrespective of gsh production.
tnf itself has a disulÂ¢de bond in the molecule [33], and the
tnf receptor also contains several disulÂ¢de bonds in the extracellular domain [34]. a plausible mechanism for reductantmediated suppression of tnf-induced nf-ub activation is
that the reductant cleaves these disulÂ¢de bonds, resulting in
the inhibition of tnf binding to the receptor. this turned out
to be the case in dtt-induced suppression of nf-ub activation as revealed by inhibition of [125 i]tnf binding to the cells
(fig. 1c). however, the [125 i]tnf binding was not aÂ¡ected at
all by 30 mm nac (fig. 1c), indicating that nac and dtt
suppressed nf-ub activation in a diÂ¡erent manner; dtt inhibits the binding of tnf to its receptor, whereas the inhibitory eÂ¡ect(s) of nac is on the downstream signalling pathway.
3.2. nac suppresses tradd-, traf2-, nik-, ikkk-,
and ikkl-induced activation of nf-ub
tnf induces the activation of nf-ub through cellular signalling pathways involving tradd, traf2, nik, ikkk,
and ikkl. to elucidate the nac-sensitive step(s) from the
tnf receptor to nf-ub activation, we analyzed the eÂ¡ect of
nac on the activation of nf-ub in cells overexpressing either
tradd, traf2, nik, ikkk, ikkl, or p65. transfection
of the plasmids encoding these genes led to signiÂ¢cant expression of these proteins, and incubation with nac or the proteasome inhibitor zlllh did not change the amount of these
proteins in the cells (fig. 2a). overexpression of these signalling molecules led to signiÂ¢cant induction (3^16-fold) of nfub reporter gene expression (fig. 2b). the induction of reporter genes by tradd, traf2, nik, ikkk, or ikkl
decreased partially when the cells were treated with nac
for 6 h in a dose-dependent manner. when compared with
the inhibitory eÂ¡ect of nac on tnf-induced nf-ub activation (fig. 1a), it was apparent that nac led to much less
suppression of nf-ub activation in cells overexpressing these
signaling molecules. this was not surprising since nac was
added after the transfection of these genes followed by an
incubation period required for expression of the genes, during
which nf-ub was fully activated. rather, the partial inhibition of tradd-, traf2-, nik-, ikkk-, and ikkl-in-

duced expression of the reporter gene reÂ£ects a signiÂ¢cant
suppression of nf-ub by nac. consistently, the proteasome
inhibitor zlllh, which attenuates the degradation of iub
(see fig. 4), also revealed a partial inhibition in the reporter
gene assay (fig. 2). in contrast, nac failed to inhibit the
induction of reporter gene expression in cells overexpressing
p65 (fig. 2b), indicating that nac did not inhibit either the
nuclear translocation or the dna binding of nf-ub. taken
together, these results indicate that nac inhibited nf-ub
activation through suppression of a step(s) between these signalling molecules and nf-ub.
3.3. nac inhibits phosphorylation and degradation of iub,
and nuclear translocation of nf-ub
translocation of nf-ub to the nucleus is a crucial step in
nf-ub activation. immunoÂ£uorescence analyses using either
anti-p65 or anti-p50 antibody have revealed that tnf-induced localization of nf-ub in the nucleus was completely
suppressed in nac-treated cells (fig. 3). nac-mediated suppression of nuclear translocation was also conÂ¢rmed by western blotting analysis of nuclear extracts (data not shown). the
inhibition of nuclear translocation suggested that nac suppressed upstream signalling systems, such as phosphorylation

iub, and the white arrowheads indicate the phosphorylated form of

fig. 5. inhibitory eÂ¡ects of nac on the activation of ikkk and ikkl in the cells. a: nac inhibits the tnf-induced activation of ikkk
and ikkl. the cells were transfected with plasmids encoding flag-tagged ikkk (prk-flag-ikkk) and ha-tagged ikkl (prk-ha-ikkl).
after 48 h, the cells were incubated with or without 30 mm nac for 1 h, and then were stimulated with 20 ng/ml tnf. at the indicated
times, the transfected ikkk and ikkl were recovered by immunoprecipitation, and then the kinase activity was estimated using gst^iubk(1^

of iub and/or release of nf-ub from iub. this prompted us
to investigate the eÂ¡ects of nac on the phosphorylation and
degradation of iub. iub was rapidly phosphorylated within
5 min of tnf stimulation, and then completely degraded
within 15 min (fig. 4). even though a small fraction of iub
was phosphorylated 10 min after tnf stimulation in the pres-

ence of nac, a large fraction of iub was neither phosphorylated nor degraded. it should be noted that the phosphorylated forms of iub were eÂ¡ectively degraded within 15 min
even in the presence of nac. in contrast, although zlllh
did not inhibit the phosphorylation of iub, it eÂ¡ectively suppressed the degradation of iubk. thus, nac suppressed iub

degrading phosphorylated iub.
3.4. nac suppresses the activation of ikkk and ikkl
the results obtained above suggested that nac suppressed
the upstream kinases, ikkk and ikkl. to assess this, we
next introduced plasmids encoding flag-tagged ikkk and
ha-tagged ikkl into the cells, and the activity of these kinases was directly determined after immunoprecipitation.
treatment of the cells with tnf rapidly activated these kinases within 10 min, whereas tnf-induced activation of both
ikkk and ikkl was markedly suppressed in the cells pretreated with nac (fig. 5a). the dose dependence of nac on
the inhibition of these kinases was similar to that of the nacmediated suppression of nf-ub activation (compare fig. 5b
with fig. 1a). again, naa failed to inhibit the activity of
these kinases, and the nac-mediated suppression was not
abolished by either bso or cycloheximide, indicating that
nac, as a reductant, inhibits both ikkk and ikkl independently of cellular gsh and new protein synthesis (fig.
5c). ikkk and ikkl are activated by the upstream kinase,
nik, in the cells. indeed, the activity of ikkk and ikkl was
increased when the cells were transfected with nik expression
plasmids (fig. 5d). noteworthy was that the nik-induced
activation of ikkk and ikkl was markedly suppressed
when the cells were cultured with nac (fig. 5d). thus, it
was evident that nac suppressed the signalling from nik to
ikkk and ikkl, which in turn resulted in the suppression of
nf-ub.
4. discussion
here we have demonstrated that nac eÂ¡ectively suppresses
the tnf-induced activation of nf-ub as a result of the suppression of both ikkk and ikkl. these kinases are the key
enzymes which phosphorylate the iub molecule associated
with nf-ub, which is followed by degradation of iub by
the proteasome system, leading to the activation and the nuclear translocation of nf-ub. thus it is intriguing that the
signalling pathway of tnf is subjected to redox regulation
not at the receptor but at the downstream kinase level. a
similar observation has been reported that another antioxidant, pdtc, also inhibits tnf-induced nf-ub activation
accompanied by the suppression of iub degradation [20]. furthermore, pdtc suppresses carbachol-induced activation of
ikkk and ikkl in canine gastric parietal cells [35]. combined together, it is most plausible that ikkk and ikkl are
regulated by redox.
it has been reported that nac activates a transcription
factor ap-1 through the stimulation of both c-jun and c-fos
expression [16]. this raises the possibility that nac stimulates
the synthesis of certain proteins which, in turn, suppress the
activation of ikkk and ikkl. however, this was ruled out
since nac eÂ¡ectively suppressed the activation of these kinases even in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor,
cycloheximide. in addition, the inhibitory eÂ¡ects of nac
were independent of the synthesis of gsh, suggesting that
the suppression of nf-ub through suppressing ikkk and
ikkl is a result of the direct reducing power of nac. however, this does not necessarily rule out a role for gsh in the
redox regulation of nf-ub activation, since it has been reported that treatment of cells with gsh ester leads to the

suppression of tnf-induced iub phosphorylation and nfub activation [36].
regarding the mechanism underlying nac-mediated suppression of ikkk and ikkl, a possible explanation is that
nac directly inhibits the kinase activity of ikkk and ikkl.
in this respect, however, it should be noted that nac failed
to inhibit ikkk and ikkl activity in vitro (data not shown),
indicating that nac mediates the suppression of these kinases
through an unknown cellular redox-sensitive mechanism(s).
another plausible mechanism is that tnf treatment produces
ros which act as signal mediators to activate nf-ub, and the
blockade of ros production by nac leads to the suppression of nf-ub. indeed, the role of ros as signal mediators
has been established in the signalling system of tnf activating c- xxxg1370xxx  (jnk) [37,38]. however, the involvement of ros in tnf-induced nf-ub activation is still
unclear. some reports have presented evidence that serine residues of iub are phosphorylated by ikkk and ikkl [11^15],
while others have shown that oxidative radical stress induces
the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues, not serine residues,
on iub [17,39]. although either form of iub phosphorylation
results in nf-ub activation, it is clear that the latter reaction
is not mediated by ikkk or ikkl but by a  xxxg2198xxx ,
and hence oxidative radical stress activates nf-ub in a manner quite diÂ¡erent from that of tnf signalling. the situation
was made more confusing by the Â¢nding that nf-ub activation by ros is cell type-speciÂ¢c: h2 o2 stimulates nf-ub in
some cell types, whereas it does not activate nf-ub at all in
other cells [19,40,41]. furthermore, an antioxidant suppresses
tnf-induced nf-ub activation even in cells in which h2 o2
did not stimulate nf-ub [41]. taking these lines of evidence
together with our present results, it may be pertinent to conclude that, although the role of ros as second messengers in
tnf signalling is unclear, an appropriate redox state is essential for tnf-induced nf-ub activation, and the disturbance
of the cellular redox state by nac results in the attenuation
of nf-ub through the suppression of ikkk and ikkl.
it should be noted that many other molecules involved in
tnf signalling as well as ikkk and ikkl are subject to
redox regulation. for instance, nac suppresses traf2-induced jnk activation by uncoupling the signalling from
traf2 to mekk1 [42]. also, an apoptosis signal-regulating
kinase, which is involved in tnf-induced activation of jnk
and p38 mapk, is subject to redox regulation through a
cellular reductant enzyme, thioredoxin (trx) [43]. an intriguing feature in this context is that oxidants and reductants
have opposite eÂ¡ects upstream and downstream of the signalling pathways from tnf to nf-ub. oxidative radical stress
induces nf-ub activation through  xxxg2198xxx (s) as described [17,39], whilst the reductant suppresses nf-ub activation through the suppression of ikkk and ikkl, as shown in
this study. in contrast, the dna binding activity of nf-ub
itself is abolished by oxidation, whilst it is fully activated by
reduction [30^32]. these results indicate that nf-ub is subject
to dual redox regulation in the cells. the dual redox regulation has also been conÂ¢rmed by the observation that trx has
dual and opposing roles in the regulation of nf-ub: trx
interferes with the degradation of iub in the cytoplasm, whilst
it enhances nf-ub transcriptional activity in the nucleus [44].
thus, nf-ub activity might be regulated by extracellular
stimuli, such as tnf, in concert with the dual redox regulation system. our data suggest that ikkk and ikkl play

pivotal roles in both the signalling from tnf to nf-ub and
