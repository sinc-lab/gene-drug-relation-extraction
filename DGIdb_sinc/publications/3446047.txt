effects of different phosphodiesterase-inhibiting drugs on human pregnant myometrium: an in vitro study.  the phosphodiesterase (pde)-inhibiting and smooth muscle relaxing effects of theophylline,  xxxd1999xxx , papaverine and moxaverine have been studied in vitro on spontaneous contracting human, pregnant myometrium. all drugs showed a close correlation between the pde-inhibiting and smooth muscle relaxing effect. the order of smooth muscle relaxing potency was papaverine greater than moxaverine greater than  xxxd1999xxx  greater than theophylline. the most potent pde-inhibitors were moxaverine and papaverine with a 50% pde-inhibiting concentration (ic50) of 3.3 and 3.8 microm as compared to the least potent pde-inhibitor, theophylline, with an ic50 of 665 microm. it is concluded that pde-inhibiting drugs show a close correlation between pde-inhibiting and relaxing effect on spontaneously contracting pregnant myometrium and that the newly developed drug  xxxd1999xxx  might be of interest in the treatment of premature uterine contractions.
