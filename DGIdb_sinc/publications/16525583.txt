summary
ample evidence suggests that many of the in vivo anti-metastatic
effects by heparins reflect their actions on  xxxg2049xxx -mediated
binding.we hypothesized that the ability of widely used heparins
and derivatives to interfere with  xxxg2049xxx -dependent tumour
cell interactions under flow in vitro could be used to identify anticoagulants with advanced inhibitory functions on experimental
blood-borne metastasis in vivo.to test this assumption, the impact of unfractionated heparin, the low-molecular-weight heparins (lmwh)  xxxd2690xxx  and enoxaparin,and the synthetic pentasaccharide fondaparinux on  xxxg2049xxx -dependent tumour interactions in vitro and metastasis formation in vivo were evalukeywords

introduction
metastasis continues to be the major cause of morbidity and
mortality in malignancies. hence, initiation and maintenance of
tumour growth in secondary organs may serve as an attractive
target for therapeutic intervention (1). various independent
studies have indicated that spontaneous and experimental metastasis is significantly inhibited by the anticoagulant heparin in
different experimental models (2). in addition to its functions as
an antithrombotic agent, many more biologic effects of heparins
have been recently elucidated that may account for their therapeutic efficacy in tumour metastasis (2, 3). compelling data sug-

ated. our data revealed that these commonly used anticoagulants widely differ in their potential to interfere with p-selectinmediated cell binding.importantly,the superior inhibitory capacity on  xxxg2049xxx  function of unfractionated heparin and lmwh
 xxxd2690xxx  as opposed to lmwh enoxaparin and synthetic heparin pentasaccharide fondaparinux strongly correlated to the
inhibitory potency of each in inhibiting experimental lung metastasis in vivo. hence,  xxxg2049xxx  inhibition may constitute a valuable feature to identify anticoagulants that are suitable for anticancer therapy.

gests that the critical antimetastatic effects by heparin are mediated primarily via interference with  xxxg2049xxx -mediated binding (4–6).
unfractionated heparin (ufh), which composes a complex
and variable set of natural glycosaminoglycan molecules, has
been gradually replaced by low-molecular-weight heparins
(lmwhs) in conditions where heparin therapy is clinically indicated. lmwhs exert important advantages over ufh, including
predictable pharmacokinetics with increased bioavailability and
half life which enable less frequent dosing without the need for
monitoring (7, 8). more recently, the synthetic pentasaccharide

methods
mice
c57bl/6 mice, aged 8–12 weeks, were purchased from charles
river (sulzfeld, germany) and were maintained on a 12 hour
light-dark cycle. mice were fed acidified drinking water and
standard chow ad libitum. all protocols were approved by the
governmental administration (darmstadt, hessen, germany).
reagents
unfractionated sodium heparin (liquimin n) was from hoffmann-la roche ag, (grenzach-wyhlen, germany),  xxxd2690xxx 
(fraxiparin) and fondaparinux ( xxxd2149xxx ) from glaxosmithkline (munich, germany), and enoxaparin ( xxxd1997xxx ) from sanofi-aventis (berlin, germany).
characterization of heparin preparations and
derivatives
the mean molecular weight and the mw distribution were determined by size exclusion chromatography according to the
method described in the monograph “low-molecular-mass heparins” (4.05/0828) of the european pharmacopoeia. the degree
of sulfation was determined by transforming the heparin salt into
its acid form and its conductimetric titration with 0.1 n naoh
(13). further, the respective specifications of the heparins were
used for the calculation of the applied gravimetric doses.
cells and culture conditions
the human melanoma cell lines nw624 and nw1539 were generated and cultured as described previously (14). the murine
b16 melanoma cell line, originally derived from spontaneous
melanoma of c57bl/6 origin, was from atcc (rockville,
usa; crl-6475). b16 cells were cultured at 37°c and 5% co2
in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (dmem; gibco invitrogen corp., karlsruhe, germany), supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (gibco), 2 mm l-glutamine (gibco), 100

u/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 250 µg/ml  xxxd164xxx  (all from sigma chemicals, deisenhofen, germany).
flow chamber assay
for flow chamber assays, glass slides were coated with recombinant  xxxg2049xxx  (r&d systems, minneapolis, usa) as described previously (15). the used flow chamber system and the
experimental conditions have been described previously (16). in
brief,  xxxg2049xxx -coated slides were mounted on a parallel plate
flow chamber system (circular parallel plate flow chamber kit,
glycotech, gaithersburg, usa). a syringe pump (perfusor secura ft, b.braun, heidelberg, germany) was connected to the
inlet port of the flow chamber system, simulating a uniform
laminar flow field at a shear stress of 0.2 dyn/cm2 by adequately
adjusting the pump rate. rolling interactions of b16 cells at a
final concentration of 106 cells/ml with  xxxg2049xxx -coated slides
were evaluated in the presence of ufh, the lmwhs  xxxd2690xxx 
and enoxaparin, synthetic heparin pentasaccharide fondaparinux
(u/ml as indicated), or serum-free dmem only. continuous real
time digital video recordings of the chamber were obtained from
a ccd camera (sony, cologne, germany), mounted on an inverted-stage microscope (axiovert 135, zeiss, oberkochen,
germany) equipped with a 10´ objective (zeiss, oberkochen,
germany). by off-line analysis of digital recordings from 30 second time frames of a window sized to correspond to an area of
15 mm2, cells were considered non-interacting when they moved
at the velocity of the flow, whereas cells moving at lower velocities were defined as rolling. the number of rolling cells was
counted per field of view (related to mm2 per min) according to
previous publications (17, 18). data were also expressed as percentage of rolling cells, which was calculated by dividing the
number of rolling cells through the total number of cells passing
the area under investigation. experiments were performed three
times, each time using a different batch of the respective anticoagulant.
experimental lung metastasis assay
as described previously (6), a total of 3 x 105 b16 cells (>90%
viability) in 100 µl pbs were injected into the lateral tail vein of
8– to 12-week-old syngeneic c57bl/6 mice (charles river).
animals received 0.9%  xxxd3213xxx , or the indicated doses
of unfractionated sodium heparin,  xxxd2690xxx , enoxaparin or
fondaparinux, respectively, 30 min before inoculation. animals
were sacrificed 11 days post-injection; lungs were excised and
fixed in phosphate-buffered 10% formaldehyde. metastatic foci
at lung surfaces were counted by two observers in a blinded
fashion.

results
heparin and their derivatives differentially interfere
with  xxxg2049xxx -dependent tumour cell interactions
under flow in vitro
in line with previous reports on several tumour cell lines (19, 20),
different cultured melanoma cells, including murine b16 cells,
are shown to strongly bind to  xxxg2049xxx  (6). murine b16 cells
were chosen as being the most suitable to be used in subsequent
flow chamber assays to determine regulatory effects of com-

quence of heparin, has been approved for clinical administration,
representing a new class of well-defined anticoagulants (9, 10).
the antimetastatic potential of antithrombotic agents in the clinical setting has created growing attention as a result of recent encouraging data from randomized prospective trials (11, 12). at
the same time, these findings disclose a clear demand for the establishment of parameters that can guide selection of anticoagulants with greatest antimetastatic capacity.
we hypothesized that the ability of different heparins and derivatives to interfere with  xxxg2049xxx -dependent tumour cell interactions under flow in vitro can be utilized to identify anticoagulants with advanced inhibitory functions on experimental bloodborne metastasis in vivo. therefore, we determined the impact of
ufh, the lmwhs  xxxd2690xxx  and enoxaparin, and the synthetic
fondaparinux with regard to their capacity to interfere with  xxxg2049xxx -dependent tumour cell binding under flow conditions to
correlate it to their capacity to block experimental melanoma
metastasis. we herein show that a superior inhibitory capacity on
 xxxg2049xxx  function in vitro can indeed predict an advanced antimetastatic activity in experimental lung metastasis in vivo.

figure 1: assessment of the capacity of unfractionated heparin,
 xxxd2690xxx , enoxaparin, and fondaparinux to inhibit b16 cell
rolling interactions with  xxxg2049xxx -coated surfaces in a parallel
flow chamber system. murine b16 melanoma cells were perfused
over  xxxg2049xxx -coated glass slides at a shear stress of 0.2 dyn/cm2 in the
presence of the indicated antithrombotic agents (each  xxxd1891xxx  u/ml, grey
bars), or serum-free media only (control, black bars). the wilcoxon test
for two independent samples was used for statistical analysis; ps for
multiple comparisons were adjusted according to the bonferroni procedure (compared to controls: * p<0.001, ** p=0.018). two to three
fields per experimental condition were counted; each of the experimental conditions was conducted thrice, revealing comparable results.

monly used antithrombotic agents on  xxxg2049xxx -mediated tumour cell binding. hence, (i) ufh, (ii) the lmwhs  xxxd2690xxx 
(nad) and enoxaparin (eno), and (iii) the synthetic pentasaccharide fondaparinux (fon), which mimics the heparin antithrombin binding site, were analyzed for their capacity to inhibit
b16 cells to interact with  xxxg2049xxx -coated surfaces in a parallel
flow chamber system (fig. 1). in the absence of anticoagulants,
46 ± 4 b16 melanoma cells (mean ± se), corresponding to a rolling fraction (rf) of 23 ± 2 %, transited in a rolling motion at an

applied shear stress of 0.2 dyne per cm2. in preliminary dosefinding experiments, the extensively studied ufh was seen to
consistently inhibit  xxxg2049xxx -dependent rolling interactions of
b16 cells under flow at a dose of 10 u/ml. to allow for comparable analyses, the lmwhs  xxxd2690xxx  and enoxaparin as
well as the synthetic fondaparinux were tested at an equal antifactor xa activity of 10 u/ml.  xxxd1891xxx  u/ml, ufh and  xxxd2690xxx 
significantly inhibited  xxxg2049xxx -mediated rolling (ufh, 16 ± 2
cells/mm2 min-1;  xxxd2690xxx , 19 ± 4 cells/mm2 min1) [rf: ufh,
8 ± 1 %; nad, 9.5 ± 2%]. conversely,  xxxd1891xxx  u/ml neither enoxaparin (36 ± 7 cells/mm2 min-1) [rf: 18 ± 3.5 %] nor fondaparinux (40 ± 2 cells/mm2 min-1) [rf: 20 ± 1%] discernibly affected
b16 rolling interactions. doses of 150 u/ml (bars in dark-grey)
by enoxaparin significantly inhibited binding (29 ± 4 cells/
mm2 min-1) [rf: 14.5 ± 2 %], while fondaparinux at 150 u/ml
failed to exert considerable effects (40 ± 2 cells/mm2 min-1) [rf:
20 ± 2 %]. together, these experiments revealed that ufh and
 xxxd2690xxx , but not enoxaparin and fondaparinux significantly
inhibited  xxxg2049xxx -dependent tumour cell interactions at equivalent anti- xxxg741xxx  doses. a further increase in the anticoagulant
activity of enoxaparin was seen to significantly block p-selectinbinding. however, fondaparinux failed to exert inhibitory effects
at doses of up to 150 u/ml (fig. 1). thus, the inhibitory capacity
on  xxxg2049xxx -dependent cell interactions among clinically used
heparins and derivatives is noticeably different and appears to be
distinct from their ability to mediate anticoagulant activities.
heparins and derivatives exert differential inhibitory
functions on experimental blood-borne metastasis at
comparable anticoagulant activities in vivo
given the pivotal role of  xxxg2049xxx  inhibition in mediating antimetastatic effects of heparins in vivo (6, 20), the diverse effects
on  xxxg2049xxx -mediated interactions by different anticoagulants
suggested to us that inhibition of  xxxg2049xxx  function of a given
anticoagulant in vitro may serve as a suitable parameter to indicate its biologic potential to block experimental metastasis in

(graphically on nonparametric box whisker plots).

are expressed as units per mouse or µg per mouse (rounded to whole

match the efficacy at the ic50 dose of the most active unfractionated
heparin (ufh). a specific anticoagulant activity of 700 axa-u/mg* (personal communication, maurice petitou, sanofi-aventis) was taken for
fondaparinux to convert µg into units.

vivo. to test this hypothesis, we evaluated the ability of the indicated anticoagulants to interfere with experimental b16 melanoma lung metastasis formation in vivo. as ufh has been demonstrated previously to critically block experimental metastasis
at single doses of 10 to 60 u per mouse prior to tumour cell injection (6), this dose range was applied in subsequent metastasis assays (fig. 2). in line with our previous findings, ufh significantly inhibited lung colony formation  xxxd1891xxx  u and 20 u, with a
further substantial decrease seen after application of 60 u. the
lmwh  xxxd2690xxx  suppressed experimental lung metastasis in

a comparable unit-dependent manner. on the contrary, lmwh
enoxaparin did not discernibly affect metastasis formation at the
lowest applied dose (10 u/mouse). this finding is consistent
with the inability of enoxaparin to suppress  xxxg2049xxx -dependent tumour cell interactions under flow conditions at anti- xxxg741xxx  activities, at which ufh and  xxxd2690xxx  exerted significant inhibitory effects (fig. 2). however, at 20 u and 60 u, also
enoxaparin significantly suppressed experimental metastasis.
yet at 20 u, the inhibitory capacity of enoxaparin (lane 9) was
considerably lower than that of both ufh (lane 3; p=0.002) and
 xxxd2690xxx  (lane 6; p=0.032; wilcoxon test for two independent
samples, p values for pair wise multiple comparisons were adjusted according to the bonferroni procedure). in contrast, the
synthetic heparin pentasaccharide fondaparinux failed to exert
antimetastatic effects at corresponding doses. only at maximum
tolerable doses in mice (180 u, which conform to 10 mg/kg), a
sizeable inhibition of b16 lung metastasis formation was observed. hence, these findings are in line with our parallel flow
chamber studies, in which fondaparinux failed to interfere with
 xxxg2049xxx -dependent tumour cell interactions even at doses that
were 15-fold higher (150 u/ml) than those needed for ufh to
exert inhibitory effects (10 u/ml; fig. 1).
anticoagulants with the lowest inhibitory drug concentration in experimental metastasis assays were seen to
be the most effective in blocking  xxxg2049xxx -dependent
tumour cell interactions under flow at equivalent antifactor xa activities
ufh and  xxxd2690xxx  not only most efficiently interfered with
 xxxg2049xxx -mediated binding under flow, but also exerted the lowest 50% inhibitory drug concentration (ic50) in experimental
metastasis assays (table 1). the interrelationship is convincingly depicted in a graph, in which the degree of  xxxg2049xxx -binding
inhibition by different anticoagulants is plotted against their respective inhibitory capacity to interfere with experimental metastasis formation (fig. 3a, b). this comparison reveals an apparent correlation between the properties tested in the two assay systems. thus, the capacity to inhibit  xxxg2049xxx -dependent b16 tumour cell binding under flow conditions in vitro may indeed constitute an important feature of antithrombotic agents to predict
their inhibitory effects on experimental blood-borne metastasis
in vivo.

discussion

figure 3: comparison of the capacity of different anticoagulants to inhibit  xxxg2049xxx -mediated binding in vitro with their
antimetastatic activity in experimental metastasis assays in
vivo. to illustrate the inverse correlation of the number of lung colonies
after treatment to the capacity of anticoagulants to inhibit p-selectinfunction in vitro, the degree of  xxxg2049xxx -binding inhibition (in %) by different anticoagulants at the respective lowest investigated dose (each at
10 u/ml) is plotted against their respective inhibitory capacity to interfere with experimental metastasis formation (ufh, nad, and eno at
10 u; fon at 40 u).

evidence for the impact of  xxxg2049xxx  on metastasis formation
was initially gained from histological examination of tumour
specimens. expression of  xxxg2049xxx  ligands by tumour cells was
recognized as a prognostic parameter: in many tumour types a
high expression of slex, a carbohydrate moiety required for
 xxxg2049xxx  binding, was associated with an increased rate of
metastasis and poor survival (21–24). the proposed role of  xxxg2049xxx  in metastasis formation was substantiated by the use of
genetically engineered  xxxg2049xxx  mutant mice. development of
experimental lung metastasis was significantly diminished after
i.v. injection of either colon carcinoma (3, 25) or melanoma cells
(6) in mice lacking expression of  xxxg2049xxx . as demonstrated by
transplantation of bone-marrow from  xxxg2049xxx  deficient mice

into irradiated recipient wild type mice, both platelet and endothelial  xxxg2049xxx  equally contribute to metastasis formation
(6).
meta-analyses from clinical trials comparing unfractionated
heparin with lmwh for prevention and treatment of venous
thromboembolism, showed an improved survival of the subgroup of cancer patients treated with either heparin preparation.
remarkably, improved survival was independent of the anticoagulant effects (26). recent data from randomized clinical
studies provided additional evidence in support of heparins to
yield survival benefits when applied in cancer patients (11, 12).
significantly, improved survival by the use of  xxxd1805xxx  relative
to coumarin derivatives was evident only in patients that did not
have metastatic disease at the time of treatment assignment. the
latter observation corresponds directly to preclinical data derived from experimental metastasis models, which have indicated that heparins primarily interfere with the establishment of
blood-borne metastasis rather than the initiation or maintenance
of metastatic tumour growth (6, 27). these data thus support the
assumption that heparins may primarily interfere with the adhesion and invasion of blood-borne metastatic cells rather than
continuation of established metastatic tumour growth. based on
this proposed mode of action, it would be rational to more appropriately administer lmwh in the adjuvant setting in r0resected patients during a period of time, in which metastasis is
most likely to occur (e.g, 6 to 12 months). clearly, the exact
mechanisms for the potential antimetastatic effects of lmwhs
in the clinical setting remain to be determined and will require
further intense investigations by both experimental and clinical
research. the work presented herein may already help to provide
rational guidance in order to identify lmwhs with potentially
superior inhibitory effects on blood-borne metastasis in vivo.
pertinent to these findings, specific oligosaccharide structures in heparin have been previously identified, which specifically interact with  xxxg2049xxx  (28) and which are distinct from the
binding site for antithrombin that confers the potent anticoagulant activity of heparins (29). the latter fact may rationally explain why fondaparinux, which was designed to specifically
mimic the heparin antithrombin binding site, failed to interfere
with  xxxg2049xxx -dependent binding interactions under flow
(fig. 1). however, the diverse inhibitory capacities of the
lmwhs  xxxd2690xxx  and enoxaparin on  xxxg2049xxx -mediated
binding and experimental metastasis formation remain to be
clarified at a mechanistic level. the discrepancy in the activities
of  xxxd2690xxx  and enoxaparin can neither be explained by mere
differences in the distribution of the molecular weight fractions
nor by the degree of sulfation (fig. 4). different characteristic
monosaccharide residues at the reducing and non-reducing end
as a result of distinct production procedures are potential biochemical characteristics that may account for the observed distinct inhibitory capacities of  xxxd2690xxx  and enoxaparin. nonetheless, the observed differences in the antimetastatic potential of distinct lmwhs at equivalent anti- xxxg741xxx  doses, which
correspond to similar gravimetric doses (table 1), provide critical functional information with regard to the appropriate choice
of antithrombotic agents for future cancer therapy trials. the assumption that antimetastatic effects of heparins and derivatives

the molecular weight data represent the range as determined by three
measurements. degree of sulfation: ufh, 1.25; nad, 1.15; eno, 1.05;
fon, 1.60. the sd of the ds determination amounts to ± 5%. the data

the specification.

are mediated via mechanisms that are distinct from their anticoagulant function is also supported by a recent prospective
clinical trial, in which the use of lmwh  xxxd1805xxx  relative to
coumarin derivatives in solid tumour patients was associated
with a significant survival benefit (11). importantly, improved
survival of lmwh-treated patients was not attributed to changes
in the number of thromboembolic events.
the antimetastatic potential of lmwh anticoagulants in the
clinical setting has created tremendous interest based on recent
promising data from randomized prospective clinical trials (11,
12). as ufh is increasingly being replaced by various lmwhs
and newer synthetic anticoagulants, there is a clear demand for
additional parameters that can better guide selection of those
available anticoagulants for future clinical trials that contain the
greatest antimetastatic capacity.
the superior capacity of unfractionated heparin and lmwh
 xxxd2690xxx  to inhibit  xxxg2049xxx -mediated rolling of melanoma
cells in vitro correlated to the inhibitory potency of each in inhibiting experimental lung metastasis with the same cells in vivo.
this in vitro-method may therefore constitute an experimentally
valuable approach to identifying heparins that are suitable for
anticancer therapy.
