the abbreviations used are: nsaid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; cox, cyclooxygenase; ssat, spermidine/ xxxd3234xxx  n1-acetyltransferase; odc,  xxxg1626xxx ; ppar, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; ppre, ppar response element; rxr,

 xxxd3259xxx , an nsaid, inhibits colorectal carcinogenesis in
rodent models (5, 6) and causes regression of adenomas (7, 8)
in patients with familial  xxxg170xxx . nsaids
work by inhibiting cyclooxygenases (coxs) of which there are
at least two distinct forms, cox-1 and cox-2. physiologically  xxxd3259xxx  is metabolized into sulfide- or sulfonecontaining derivatives. the sulfide derivative inhibits colon
carcinogenesis by inhibiting cox-1 and cox-2 enzyme activities (9). however,  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone also inhibits chemical
carcinogenesis in rodents but by a mechanism that cannot be
explained solely by the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis
(10, 11), yet both derivatives inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in a variety of human tumor-derived cell lines (12, 13).
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone, at clinically relevant concentrations ranging from 35 ␮m (in humans) to around 150 ␮m (in mice), has
been shown to have chemopreventive effects on colon cancer
(12, 14 –16).
one of the cox-independent mechanisms of action of  xxxd3259xxx  and its metabolites is to act as ligands for peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptors (ppars). ppars are nuclear
hormone receptors that bind to sequence-specific dna response elements known as ppres as a heterodimer with rxr␣
and can regulate gene expression. there are three ppar isotypes, ␣, ␥, and ␦, present in humans. there is evidence that
 xxxd208xxx  metabolites like 15-deoxy-⌬12,14-pgj2 can
serve as activating ligands for ppars (17, 18). further ppar␥
can act as a potential tumor suppressor (19 –21), while ppar␦
can act as a potential oncogene (22, 23) in colon cancer.  xxxd3259xxx  can bind ppar␥ and ppar␦ as their ligands and lead to
their activation, which can have either a positive or a negative
effect on gene transcription (22, 24).
nsaids, like  xxxd2969xxx , aspirin, and indomethacin, have
been shown to exert their chemopreventive action by affecting
the polyamine metabolism in colorectal cancer (25–27). the
polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and  xxxd3234xxx  are abundant polycations in eukaryotic cells that are often elevated in
neoplastic cells when compared with normal cells and tissues
(28). the polyamine levels are tightly regulated by the biosynthetic enzyme  xxxg1626xxx  (odc) and the catabolic
enzyme spermidine/ xxxd3234xxx  n1-acetyltransferase (ssat) in
cells. high levels of polyamines lead to rapid proliferation (29),
while lower levels of polyamines have been shown to promote
apoptosis (30, 31) and inhibit cell growth (32). because of the
effects of the polyamines on apoptosis and proliferation, regulation of the expression of these enzymes has been an area of
intense research (33–38). the effects of one of the nsaids,
indomethacin, on polyamine metabolism involve suppression of
odc and induction of ssat, thereby decreasing polyamine
pools in colon cancer cells (25). however, it is not known how
nsaids induce ssat nor has a role for polyamines in nsaid
actions, such as induction of apoptosis, been investigated. in

 xxxd3259xxx , a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory prodrug,
is metabolized into pharmacologically active sulfide and
sulfone derivatives.  xxxd3260xxx , but not  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfone, inhibits cyclooxygenase (cox) enzyme activities, yet both derivatives have growth inhibitory effects
on colon cancer cells. microarray analysis was used to
detect cox-independent effects of  xxxd3259xxx  on gene expression in human colorectal cells. spermidine/ xxxd3234xxx  n1-acetyltransferase (ssat) gene, which encodes a
polyamine catabolic enzyme, was induced by clinically
relevant  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone concentrations. northern
blots confirmed increased ssat rna levels in these colon cancer cells. deletion analysis and mutational studies were done to map the  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone-dependent
response sequences in the ssat 5ⴕ-flanking sequences.
this led us to the identification of two peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar) response elements
(ppres) in the ssat gene. ppre-2, at ⴙ48 bases relative
to the transcription start site, is required for the induction of ssat by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone and is specifically
bound by ppar␥ in the caco-2 cells as shown by transfection and gel shift experiments. ppre-1, at ⴚ323 bases
relative to the start site, is not required for the induction of ssat by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone but can be bound by
both ppar␦ and ppar␥.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone reduced cellular polyamine contents in the absence but not in the
presence of verapamil, an inhibitor of the export of
monoacetyl diamines, inhibited cell proliferation and
induced apoptosis. the induced apoptosis could be partially rescued by exogenous putrescine. these data suggest that apoptosis induced by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone is mediated, in part, by the cox-independent, ppar-dependent
transcriptional activation of ssat, leading to reduced
tissue polyamine contents in human colon cancer cells.

role of polyamines in  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone-induced apoptosis
this study, we investigated the effects of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone on
ssat and polyamine metabolism and asked whether polyamines were involved in  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone-induced apoptosis of
colon cancer cells.

plasmids

cell culture and transfections
the caco-2 cell line was purchased from american type culture
collection (atcc) (manassas, va) at passage 12 and was maintained in
minimum essential ␣-medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution. the human colon cancer cell line hct-116 was maintained as a monolayer culture in mccoy’s 5a medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus 1%
penicillin/streptomycin solution. cultures were maintained at 37 °c in
a humidified atmosphere of 5% co2. all cell culture supplies were
from invitrogen.
transient transfections were performed using lipofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol. briefly, 5 ⫻ 105 cells
were seeded in a 6-well plate and cultured in normal medium for 24 h.
each well was transfected with 1 ␮g of firefly luciferase reporter construct along with 0.2 ␮g of pcmv-␤-galactosidase expression plasmid,
which acted as a transfection efficiency control. after 6 h of incubation
with lipofectamine-dna complex, cells were supplemented with complete medium having 20% fetal bovine serum and 2% penicillin/streptomycin solution and grown overnight. afterward the medium was
removed, and cells were refed with medium along with various concentrations of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone or its vehicle,  xxxd1896xxx  (me2so),
for 48 h.
for ppar studies, triple transient transfections were performed
using the same protocol as above. each well was transfected with 1 ␮g
of firefly luciferase reporter construct with or without 0.5 ␮g of expression plasmid for xppar␥, xppar␦, or xppar␣ and hrxr␣. 0.2 ␮g of
pcmv-␤-galactosidase expression plasmid was cotransfected into each
well for transfection efficiency. after 6 h of incubation with lipofectamine-dna complex, cells were supplemented with complete medium having 20% fetal bovine serum and 2% penicillin/streptomycin
solution and grown overnight. on the following day, the medium was
removed, and cells were refed with medium along with the appropriate
ppar activator or its vehicle, me2so, for 48 h.
all transfections were performed in triplicates unless stated differently. all transfected cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered
saline and lysed, and luciferase activities were measured using 10 ␮l of
cell extract and 50 ␮l of luciferase reagent (promega). ␤-galactosidase
activity was measured using the ␤-galactosidase assay kit (invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

cdna microarray analysis
probe preparation—the microarray chip was made as described in
detail before (40). the chip has ⬃5,300 human genes; ⬎3,000 are known
genes, and the remainder are expressed sequence tags as determined by
unigene. a list of the clones on the arrays is available upon request.
target preparation—microarray analysis was done as described before (41). in short, the rneasy total rna kit (qiagen, valencia, ca) and
protocol was used to isolate total rna from the caco-2 cells treated
with either vehicle or  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone. fluorescent first strand cdna
was made using the micromax direct cdna microarray system
(perkinelmer life sciences) following the manufacturer’s protocols.
cdna from  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone-treated cells were cy5 (amersham biosciences)-labeled, while vehicle-treated cells were cy3 (amersham biosciences)-labeled. labeled cdna from two reactions (one cy3-labeled
and one cy5-labeled) was combined and purified on a microcon-50
column, lyophilized, resuspended in hybridization buffer (2⫻ ssc, 0.1%
sds, 100 ng/␮l cot1 dna, 100 ng/␮l oligo(da)), denatured by boiling for
2.5 min, and added to a denatured (2-min boil, slide in double distilled
water, plunge into room temperature ethanol, spin dry at 500 ⫻ g)
microarray. a coverslip (22 ⫻ 22 mm) was applied, and the array was
placed in a hybridization chamber (catalog number hyb-03, genemachines) at 62 °c for 18 h. following hybridization, slides were washed
and then scanned for cy3 and cy5 fluorescence using an axon genepix
4000 microarray reader (axon instruments, foster city, ca) and quantitated using genepix software. the analysis was done three independent times with the rna of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone-treated caco-2 cells.

rna isolation and analysis
total rna was obtained from cells by extraction using trizol reagent and used for northern blotting as described previously (42, 43).
membranes were hybridized with 32p-labeled cdna encoding for human ssat and  xxxg861xxx  ( xxxg861xxx ).
data are expressed as the ratio of the integrated densities of 32p-labeled
hybridization bands for the ssat and  xxxg861xxx  genes.

in vitro transcription/translation
cdnas for xppar␣, xppar␥, xppar␦, and hrxr␣ were transcribed
and translated in vitro from the psg5-xppar␣, psg5-xppar␥, psg5xppar␦, and pcmx-hrxr␣kpn plasmids, respectively. the tnt coupled reticulocyte lysate system (promega) was used according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. translation products were verified by
sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

gel electromobility shift assays
nuclear extracts were prepared from caco-2 cells essentially as
described previously (44). to study the binding of nuclear hormone
receptors to the putative ppre, two double-stranded oligonucleotides,
ppre-2 and ppre-1, spanning nucleotides ⫹35 to ⫹70 and ⫺304 to
⫺336, respectively, of the ssat 5⬘ sequence, were 32p-labeled with
polynucleotide kinase (promega). a 15-␮l reaction containing 0.5 ng of
ppre probe and 5 ␮g of nuclear extract or 0.5–1 ␮l of in vitro translation reaction was incubated for 20 min at 25 °c and 15 min at 4 °c in a
buffer containing 20 mm hepes (ph 8), 60 mm kcl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 2 ␮g of poly(di-dc). the dna-protein complexes
were resolved from the free probe by electrophoresis at 4 °c on a 5%
polyacrylamide gel in 1⫻ tris borate-edta buffer, ph 8. doublestranded oligonucleotides composed of the following sequences were
used for gel shift analysis: ppre-2 (w), 5⬘-agaaaagagcaaggtcacttgtcggggggctg-3⬘; ppre-1 (w2), 5⬘-ccgtcactcgccgaggttccttgggtcatggtgcc-3⬘; ppre-2mut (m), 5⬘-agaaaacagtaattgaacttggtggggggctg-3⬘; ppre-1mut (m2), 5⬘-cgtcactcgtttgggtgacgggtcgtggtgcc-3⬘. the ppre sequence is underlined,
and the mutated bases are shown in lowercase letters.

immunoblotting
western blots were done for cox-2 as described elsewhere (42).
cox-2 antibodies were obtained from santa cruz biotechnology (santa
cruz, ca) and used at 1:5,000 dilutions, respectively. all western blots
were repeated three times, and a representative blot was chosen
for presentation.

cell number and viability determinations
caco-2 cells were seeded at a concentration of 1 ⫻ 106 cells/100-mm
culture plate. the cells were grown for 24 h before they were refed with
a new medium and treated with  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone, 1 mm putrescine,
both, or the vehicle me2so. the cells were then harvested after 0, 1,

expression plasmids psg5-xppar␥, psg5-xppar␦, and psg5-xppar␣ were generously given by dr. liliane michalik (institute de
biologie animale, lausanne, switzerland). the expression plasmid
pcmx-hrxr␣kpn was kindly provided by dr. ronald evans (the salk
institute for biological studies, la jolla, ca). full-ssat-luc, having a
3.493-kb-long 5⬘-flanking sequence of the human ssat gene was cloned
into a promoterless pgl2-basic vector (promega, madison, wi) as previously reported (39). 197-ssat-luc, having 283 nucleotides of the 5⬘flanking region of ssat promoter, was made from full-ssat-luc using
polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pgl2-basic vector.
ppre3-tk-luc reporter construct, having three tandem repeats of
ppre 5⬘ to the luciferase gene, was a gift from dr. ronald evans.
48ppre-ssat-luc was made by cloning 100 nucleotides of the 5⬘-flanking region of ssat promoter into pgl2-basic vector. ⌬48ppre-ssat-luc
has the ppre at ⫹48 replaced by a random sequence from the ssat 5⬘
promoter region, which has no putative transcription factor binding
sites as determined by transfac data base analysis.

statistical analysis
all transient transfection experiments were performed in triplicates
and were repeated at least three times. cell growth assays, apoptosis

 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone leads to cell growth inhibition and induction of cell death in caco-2 cells— xxxd3259xxx  and its derivatives
have been shown to either inhibit cell proliferation or induce
apoptosis in colon cancer cells (49 –51). we wanted to see
whether  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone, at doses that are clinically relevant,
have any growth-suppressive effects on caco-2 cells. we did cell
counting using a hemocytometer to estimate cell proliferation
and found that  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone at concentrations of 50 ␮m and

role of polyamines in  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone-induced apoptosis

above have a statistically significant effect on the inhibition of
cell proliferation after 6 days (fig. 1a). by doing trypan blue
cell staining, which stains for dead cells, we found that  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfone at concentrations of 150 ␮m and above have a significant effect on inducing cell death (fig. 1b).
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone induces ssat leading to decreased polyamine levels in caco-2 cells—dna microarray analysis of
5,300 genes with the cdna prepared from total rna from the
caco-2 human colorectal cancer cells treated with 600 ␮m  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone, which is the dose necessary to reduce colony
formation by 50% (ic50 dose), showed altered expression of
several genes compared with the control-treated caco-2 cells.
one of these genes was ssat whose expression was induced
3.94 ⫾ 0.64-fold in treated caco-2 cells as compared with the
controls (p ⬍ 0.06). the induction in ssat mrna expression
was confirmed by northern analysis (fig. 2a). we next wanted
to determine whether clinically relevant concentrations of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone have any effect on ssat expression. we found
that  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone at concentrations of 100 ␮m and above led
to an induction in ssat mrna (data not shown). to determine
whether this induction of ssat expression is at the level of
ssat transcription, we did transient transfection experiments
using the full-ssat-luc reporter promoter construct, which
has 3.53 kb of the ssat 5⬘ promoter flanking region in front of
the luciferase gene, and then treated the cells with various
concentrations of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone at concentrations of 100 ␮m or greater led to an induction in the fullssat-luc promoter activity in the caco-2 cells after 48 h of
incubation (fig. 2b). these data suggest that  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone
increases the ssat gene expression at the level of transcription. next we wanted to see whether this induction in ssat
promoter activity and ssat rna affects the activity of ssat
enzyme resulting in altered cellular polyamine levels.  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfone led to a 2-fold induction in the ssat activity, which
was correlated with a 2-fold reduction in the intracellular levels of  xxxd3234xxx  and spermidine with the treatment of  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfone for 48 h (data not shown).
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone is acting in a cox-2-independent manner
to induce ssat— xxxd3259xxx  sulfone has been shown to have
both cox-dependent and cox-independent mechanisms of action (10, 11). to elucidate the mechanism by which  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfone is inducing ssat we used hct-116 cells, which have
no detectable cox-2 protein levels as compared with the
caco-2 cells (fig. 3a). we expected to see lower pge2 levels in
these cells due to the reduction in cox-2 protein. hct-116
cells had an approximately 10-fold reduced pge2 concentration
as compared with caco-2 cells (fig. 3b). to determine whether
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone is acting in a cox-dependent manner, we
hypothesized that sulfone would have no effect on ssat promoter in hct-116 cells. on the contrary, we found that  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone led to an induction in the full-ssat-luc promoter
construct in hct-116 cells after 48 h of treatment (fig. 3c).
next treatment of hct-116 cells with  xxxd3259xxx  or its metabolites  xxxd3260xxx  and  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone showed that both
 xxxd3259xxx  and  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone, but not  xxxd3260xxx , induced
ssat rna in hct-116 cells (fig. 3d). this indicated that
ssat induction by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone involves a mechanism that
is not dependent on the cox-2 inhibition. to further test
whether  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone is acting in a cox-2-independent
manner, we added 20 ␮m pge2 to caco-2 cells and measured
ssat rna after 48 h of treatment. addition of pge2 led to an
increase in the intracellular pge2 levels as measured by a
pge2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown).
if  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone is acting in a cox-dependent manner, then
the addition of pge2 should lead to a reduction in the ssat
rna. on the contrary, we found that addition of 20 ␮m pge2

pendent, response elements in the ssat gene, portions of the
ssat 5⬘-flanking sequences were tested for their ability to
mediate  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone-induced transcription of a reporter
gene. five luciferase constructs were used, each containing
portions of the ssat 5⬘-flanking region linked to a promoter-

less firefly luciferase gene. full-ssat-luc, 659-ssat-luc, 358ssat-luc, 197-ssat-luc, and 48ppre-ssat-luc contained 3.53,
0.74, 0.44, 0.28, and 0.1 kb, respectively, of the ssat 5⬘-flanking sequence (fig. 4a). in one set of experiments, all of these
constructs as well as the promoterless pgl2-basic control con-

struct were transfected into the caco-2 cells. following transfection, the cells were treated with 300 ␮m  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone
or its vehicle for 48 h.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone treatment activated
transcription of all of these constructs by ⬃2–3-fold over the
control-treated cells (fig. 4b). a 2-fold induction in the 48ppressat-luc construct suggested the presence of a  xxxd3259xxx  sulfonedependent response element in the 0.1 kb of the ssat 5⬘flanking sequence (fig. 4c).
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone has been shown to work by acting as a
ligand for ppar␥ and ppar␦ (22, 24). we hypothesized that
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone is acting via a ppar-dependent pathway to
induce ssat since there are two putative ppre sites in the 5⬘-

flanking region of the ssat promoter, only one of which is in
the 197-ssat-luc and 48ppre-ssat-luc construct, as initially
identified using a transcription factor search analysis (transfac data base). ppre-1 is present at ⫺323, and ppre-2 is
present at ⫹48 respective to the transcriptional start site in the
ssat gene. to study the involvement of ppars in the induction of ssat gene expression, ppar expression was determined in the caco-2 cells. caco-2 cells express both ppar␦ and
ppar␥ proteins as detected by western and northern blot
analysis (data not shown). next, since ppars function as receptors, we wanted to determine whether ppars are functional
in caco-2 cells. transient transfection experiments were done
to determine the functionality of ppars and their role in the
regulation of ssat. caco-2 cells were transfected with the
tk-ppre3-luc plasmid and then treated with  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone
and an array of ppar activators. ciglitazone, a ppar␥ activator, led to a 6-fold induction in luciferase, while cpgi, a ppar␦
activator; wy14463, a ppar␣ activator; 15-⌬-pgj2, an endogenous ppar␥ activator; and  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone led to a significant 2-fold induction in luciferase activity (fig. 5a). thus  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone was directly or indirectly activating functional
ppars in the caco-2 cells, which were then inducing the luciferase activity. to see whether the induction of ppars has any
effect on the ssat expression in caco-2 cells, northern blots
were done to study the effect of these activators on ssat rna
after 48 h.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone, as shown before, led to a 5.5-fold
induction, while ciglitazone and cpgi led to a ⬃2.5-fold induction in ssat rna. wy14463 had no effect on ssat rna after
48 h (fig. 5b). these results indicate that ppars are involved
in the induction of ssat by the  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone in the caco-2
cells, but that ppars are not the only way by which  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfone is inducing the ssat gene in caco-2 cells.
to further characterize the responsiveness of these ppres to
the various ppar subtypes, all five ssat promoter reporter
constructs were transfected into caco-2 cells and assayed for
luciferase activity in the presence and absence of various
ppars and their activators. the expression plasmid for rxr␣
was transfected to all the cells along with the ␤-galactosidase
plasmid, which acted as the transfection efficiency control. the
activators used were ciglitazone (ppar␥ activator), cpgi
(ppar␦ activator), and wy14463 (ppar␣ activator). as shown
in fig. 6a, cells transfected with ppar␥ and treated with
ciglitazone demonstrated a 3.5– 4.5-fold increase in transcription of the reporter constructs having as low as 0.1 kb of the 5⬘flanking sequence. ppar␥ alone was not able to activate transcription of these promoter constructs. ppar␦ was also able to
activate transcription in these plasmids, but it could not induce
either 197-ssat-luc or 48ppre-ssat-luc plasmid, which lack
the ppre-1 sequence (fig. 6b). finally the ppar␣ subtype
was unable to positively regulate transcription of any of the
reporter constructs in the presence of its activator, but ppar␣
alone was able to induce full-ssat-luc by 2-fold (fig. 6c).
ppar␥ is involved in regulating ssat expression by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone—based on the previous results showing that  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone induces ppars and that the induction by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone is retained in the 48ppre-ssat-luc construct,
which has only the ppre-2, we wanted to test whether ppre-2
plays an important role in  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone-induced activation
of ssat gene. for this, we made another promoter construct,
⌬48ppre-ssat-luc, which has the same sequence as 48ppressat-luc but has a deleted ppre-2. caco-2 cells were transfected with either of these plasmids or the 197-ssat-luc and
treated with  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone for 48 h.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone led to a
significant increase in the transcription of the ppre-containing constructs but did not affect transcription of the ppredeleted construct (fig. 7a). further, to test whether ppre-2 is

in the cell with around 2-fold accumulation of n1-acetylspermidine in the cell. when verapamil was added along with
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone, it led to a 2–2.5-fold induction in levels of
polyamines and a 3.5-fold induction in the levels of n1-acetylspermidine (fig. 9). this result showed that  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone
caused reduction in intracellular polyamine levels due to their
increased excretion from the cell. intracellular polyamines can
be decreased by either inducing ssat, a catabolic enzyme, or
by suppressing odc, a biosynthetic enzyme. it has been shown
before that indomethacin, an nsaid, can decrease polyamine
levels by inducing ssat and decreasing odc enzyme activity
(25). based on this observation, we wanted to see the effects of
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone on odc in caco-2 cells. we found that concentrations of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone that induce ssat and decrease
polyamines in caco-2 cells did not have any effect on the
expression of either odc rna or odc enzyme activity (data
not shown).
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone-induced death of caco-2 cells can be rescued by exogenous putrescine—the effect of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone
on polyamines could suggest that  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone is acting via
a polyamine-dependent mechanism to exert its effects on cell
growth, apoptosis, or both in colon cancer cells. to test this
hypothesis, we treated cells with 1 mm putrescine to increase
intracellular polyamine levels. putrescine was able to replenish
the intracellular polyamines in these cells as detected by high
performance liquid chromatography. all three major polyamines, putrescine,  xxxd3234xxx , and spermidine were elevated in
the combined treated (sulfone and putrescine) cells as compared with the  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone-only treated cells (fig. 9a)
after 4 days in culture. as shown before,  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone led to
an inhibition of cell proliferation that was not rescued by exogenous putrescine in a span of 6 days (fig. 9b). however, 1 mm
putrescine was able to prevent cell death caused by  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfone by around 50% in a span of 6 days (fig. 9c). to test
whether the cell death caused by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone is due to
apoptosis, we detected the changes in the position of phosphatidylserine in the cell membrane using an  xxxg166xxx  kit. we
observed that, after 6 days,  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone-induced cell death
was due to apoptosis, and putrescine was able to prevent the
apoptosis caused by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone by around 50% (fig. 9d).

acted upon by an activated ppar␥, we used gw9446, a ppar␥
antagonist. caco-2 cells were transfected with either 197ssat-luc or full-ssat-luc and treated with either sulfone, a
combination of sulfone and gw9446, or their vehicle, me2so,
for 48 h. gw9446 was able to totally abolish the induction of
197-ssat-luc by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone but could only partially do it
for the full-ssat-luc (fig. 7b). these data suggest that  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone induces ssat transcription by activation of
ppar␥, which then binds to the ppre-2.
ppars and rxr␣ bind as heterodimers to the ssat
ppre—to determine whether ppars bind to the ppre as
heterodimers with rxr␣, gel shift assays were performed with
a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing either ppre-1
(w2) or ppre-2 (w) and in vitro translated ppar proteins.
since ppars bind dna as a heterodimer with rxr␣, all reaction mixtures had ppars along with rxr␣. as shown in fig.
8a, only ppar␥-rxr␣-dna could bind to the ppre-2 but not
to the ppre-2mut. a 20-fold excess of unlabeled ppre-2, but
not ppre-2mut, oligonucleotide was able to compete for this
binding, indicating that ppar␥ is binding specifically to
ppre-2. gel shifts done using the ppar␦ or ppar␣ along with
the rxr␣ showed no binding with the ppre-2-containing wild
type oligonucleotide (data not shown). furthermore nuclear
extracts from caco-2 cells were able to form an in vitro complex
with the ppre-2 (fig. 8a). to test the specificity of the proteindna interactions, a ppar-specific antibody was added to the
in vitro protein-dna complex. this led to a supershift, which is
seen as a slower migrating band (fig. 8a). gel shift assays were
also done using the ppre-1 probe (w2) along with the in vitro
translated proteins. as shown in fig. 8b, all ppars could bind
to the ppre-1. competition assays using 20-fold excess unlabeled ppre-1 (w2) showed that all the ppar isotypes bind with
equal specificity to the ppre-1.
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone reduces polyamines by increased export—we have demonstrated that, in caco-2 cells, there is an
increase in ssat rna and an increase in ssat promoterregulated transcription when treated with  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone.
this induction of ssat is correlated with a 2-fold reduction in
the intracellular levels of  xxxd3234xxx  and spermidine (fig. 9)
when treated with 600 ␮m  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone for 48 h. to determine whether the reduction in intracellular polyamine levels is
due to increased export of acetylated polyamines from the cell,
we used verapamil, which has been shown to inhibit the diamine exporter specific for diamine polyamines (52). verapamil
at a concentration of 100 ␮m alone led to increased polyamines

transcription occurs at clinically relevant doses of  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfone and involves the activation of ppars. ssat induction
by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone is associated with a decrease in intracellular polyamines. this decrease can be blocked by verapamil, an
inhibitor of the diamine exporter (52), which exports polyamines acetylated by ssat.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone also induces apoptosis in these colon cancer cells, in part, via a polyamine-dependent mechanism as replenishment of the intracellular
polyamine pools by exogenous putrescine is able to partially
rescue this apoptosis. these results suggest that  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone is activating ssat expression, which in turn leads to
reduced intracellular polyamine contents, which in turn leads
to increased apoptosis (fig. 10). in this study, we have identified two ppre sequences in the 5⬘ region of the human ssat
gene that are similar to the consensus sequences for previously
identified ppres. ppre-1 is at ⫺323 bases, while ppre-2 is at
⫹48 bases relative to the transcription start site. further we
demonstrate that ssat induction by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone requires
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone-induced activation of ppar␥, which can then
bind to the ppre-2 in the ssat gene.

animal and in vitro studies indicate that  xxxd3259xxx  and  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone inhibit colorectal cancer by mechanisms that cannot be explained solely by inhibition of prostaglandin formation
(12, 16). studying the mechanism of induction of ssat by
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone revealed a cox-independent action in caco-2
cells based on two pieces of evidence. first, adding exogenous
pge2 does not influence the ssat expression, and second,
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone is able to induce ssat in hct-116, a cell line
that lacks any detectable cox-2 protein and has very low
levels of pge2. induction of ssat by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone appears
to occur at the level of transcription, which is consistent with
the results that ssat promoter activity and ssat rna levels
are induced after exposure to  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone (fig. 11).
nsaids like indomethacin can reduce intracellular polyamine
levels by inducing ssat and inhibiting odc enzyme activity in
caco-2 cells (25). we found that  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone has no observed effect on the expression of odc rna and enzyme activity in the caco-2 cells, suggesting that the changes in polyamine pools are a result of modulation of ssat expression.
there are many potential transcription factor binding sites

role of polyamines in  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone-induced apoptosis

identified in the ssat promoter when it was originally cloned
(39). we used various ssat 5⬘-flanking sequence deletion constructs to map the ssat gene, which is responsive to the
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone-induced activation. this led us to the 0.1-kb
segment of the ssat gene (⫺88 to ⫹88) that was still responsive to  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone-induced activation. searching for potential response elements in this 0.1-kb sequence led us to
identify a putative ppre sequence. based on the role of ppars
in colon cancer (20 –23), the relationship between  xxxd3259xxx  and
ppars (22, 24), and the existence of ppre in the ssat promoter region, the possibility that  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone is inducing
ssat via activating ppars was tested. the likelihood that the
observed induction of ssat in these cells by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone
involves transcriptional regulation by ppars was substantiated by both the reporter promoter construct analysis and
through the use of specific ppar activators.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone
induces expression of the tk-ppre3-luc plasmid in caco-2
cells, while ciglitazone (an activator of ppar␥) and cpgi (an
activator of ppar␦) treatments resulted in a significant increase in ssat rna and promoter activity. both of these
experiments, although different, indicate that ppar activation
is one of the mechanisms by which  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone is inducing
ssat in these cells. this effect on ppars is not the only
mechanism of ssat induction by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone as ppar
activation cannot induce ssat to the levels as done by  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfone. there are other sp1, ap-1, and camp-response element transcription factor binding sites in the 5⬘ promoter
flanking region of the ssat gene that could be involved in the
regulation of ssat by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone.
to characterize the putative ppre-2 found at ⫹48 in the
ssat gene, transfection experiments using the various ssat

5⬘-flanking deletion constructs along with the ppar and rxr␣
proteins were done. the results shown here demonstrate the
identification of one more ppre, ppre-1, in the ssat promoter at ⫺323 bases relative to the ssat transcription start
site. further, by transfection experiments, we show that
ppre-1 can be bound by both ppar␦ and ppar␥ in the caco-2
cells, but ppre-2 is bound only by the ppar␥. by mutating
ppre-2 and using the ppar␥ antagonist, it was confirmed
that only ppre-2 is bound by ppar␥ and is required for the
induction of ssat by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone. gel shifts using in vitro
translated ppars and rxr␣ showed that ppar␦/rxr␣ binds
to the ppre at ⫺323 site, while ppar␥/rxr␣ binds at both
⫹48 and ⫺323 sites.
the effects of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone on preventing colon cancer are
likely mediated by stimulating cellular apoptotic pathways or
by inhibiting cellular proliferation (9, 10, 53). high levels of
polyamines lead to rapid proliferation (29), while lower levels of
polyamines have been shown to promote apoptosis (30, 31) and
inhibit cell growth (32). based on the fact that polyamines and
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone have opposite effects on proliferation and apoptosis we questioned whether  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone-induced cell
death is due to polyamine depletion in the caco-2 cells. the
results demonstrate that  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone induces cell death,
which can be partially inhibited by replenishing the intracellular polyamine levels by exogenous putrescine or other polyamines (data not shown). further  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone-induced cell
death is primarily due to apoptosis in these cells. replenishing
the intracellular polyamine levels was not able to rescue the
inhibition of cell proliferation caused by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone.
these results indicate that induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone are two distinct

sulfone in caco-2 colon cancer cells.
increased polyamines, as found in neoplastic cells, inhibit apoptosis. cells regulate intracellular polyamine pools by
regulating their biosynthesis or their catabolism by ssat.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone reduces intracellular polyamine pools by inducing ssat, which leads to an increased
export of the polyamines from the cells.
induction of ssat by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone involves a cox-independent but ppar-dependent mechanism in the caco-2 cells.
there are two ppres in the ssat gene.
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone induces ssat by activation of ppar␥, which can then bind to the
ppre-2 in the ssat promoter. ppre-1 is
not involved in the induction of ssat by
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone but can bind to ppar␥
and ppar␦.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone can induce
ssat by acting on other transcription factor response elements upstream of the
ppre-1.

pathways in the caco-2 cells. putrescine is able to partially
rescue apoptosis without having any effect on proliferation.
this is not a new result as it has been shown that, in odcknockout mice, odc is an essential gene (54). immunohistochemical analysis showed that knocking out odc has no effect
on proliferation, but there is an increased dna breakage associated with apoptosis in the blastocysts. this indicates a possible role of polyamines in apoptosis but not in proliferation in
these mice.
nsaids appear to be working by a mechanism involving
ssat induction and by decreasing intracellular polyamine levels in colon cancer cells. we have recently reported that aspirin
induces ssat and lowers intracellular putrescine and spermidine without affecting odc activity in colon cancer cells (27).
others have found that indomethacin,  xxxd2969xxx , and  xxxd3259xxx 
work by regulating genes in polyamine metabolism, ultimately
leading to decreased polyamines (25, 26, 55). recently it has
been shown that exogenous polyamine reverses  xxxd3259xxx -induced toxicity in colon cancer cells (55). results presented here
suggest that one mechanism for the antitumor properties of
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone is to act in a cox-independent but ppar-dependent way to induce ssat gene expression in caco-2 colon
tumor cells.
