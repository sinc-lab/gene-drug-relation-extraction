nineteen patients examined, with a wide range of expression levels. interestingly, in paired
gbm tissues from seven patients before and after vaccination therapy, increased levels of

potassium channels in brain tumors is variable, which may be associated with different
tumor permeability to therapeutic agents among patients.

introduction

brain capillary endothelium and its contiguous cells, pericytes
and astrocytes, form the blood–brain barrier (bbb) (black and
ningaraj, 2004; cloughesy and black, 1995; terasaki and
pardridge, 2000). the blood–brain tumor barrier (btb), which

includes the microvessels supplying brain tumors, retains
many characteristics of the normal bbb that significantly
impedes the adequate delivery of chemotherapeutics into
brain tumors (fenstermacher and cowles, 1977; groothuis et
al., 1982; neuwelt et al., 1982). however, btb has also
structural and functional characteristics that are different

from those of normal bbb. in particular, there are receptors,
ion channels and enzymes that are uniquely over-expressed
in the tissue and microvessels of brain tumors that regulate
vascular permeability (black et al., 1997; black and ningaraj,
2004; inamura and black, 1994; matsukado et al., 1996; nomura
et al., 1994). pharmacologically modulating these unique
components of the btb can selectively increase transport of
chemotherapeutics across tumor capillaries and into brain
tumors. therefore, understanding the biochemical regulation
of the btb is critical for developing approaches to increase
delivery of therapeutic compounds to brain tumors.
widely distributed katp channels are heterodimers of
sulfonylurea receptors and inwardly rectifying potassium
channel subunits (kir6.x) with a (sur-kir6.x) 4 stoichiometry
(masia et al., 2005; rosenblum, 2003). in the vasculature of the
brain, katp channels, by coupling intracellular metabolic
changes to the electrical activity of the plasma membrane,
regulate cerebral vascular tone and mediate the relaxation of
cerebral vessels to diverse stimuli, including vasomodulators,
in normal (brayden, 2003) and disease states (kitazono et al.,
1995). recently, intravenous infusion of minoxidil sulfate (ms)
has been shown to increase tumor permeability via activation
of katp channels without any effect on permeability of normal
brain capillaries in rg2 experimentally-induced gliomas
(ningaraj et al., 2003b). up-regulation of  xxxg1253xxx  expression was detected in and around brain tumors in a hypoxic
environment (ruoslahti, 2002) and also in ischemic conditions
(kitazono et al., 1995).
the calcium-activated potassium (kca) channels represent
a unique member of the six transmembrane domain  xxxg1232xxx  family that are triggered by depolarization and
enhanced by an increase in cytosolic ca2+ (brenner et al., 2000;
faraci and heistad, 1998). kca channels of cerebral blood
vessels participate in regulating cerebral blood vessel tone
(kitazono et al., 1995). our previous studies have shown that
ns-1619, a kca channel agonist, significantly enhances btb
permeability in the brain tumors of rg2 experimentallyinduced glioma but not in normal brain tissue (ningaraj et
al., 2002). the selective increase in btb permeability with ns1619 was significantly attenuated by the kca channel antagonist, iberiotoxin (ningaraj et al., 2002). we have proposed that
kca channels over-expressed in tumor microvessels serve as a
convergence point for btb permeability modulation by
molecules such as bradykinin,  xxxd2738xxx  (no) donors, and
ns-1619 (ningaraj et al., 2002). these findings suggest kca
channels are effective targets for btb modulation, although it
is conceivable that other types of potassium channels such as
katp channels may also contribute to btb permeability
regulation (ningaraj et al., 2003b).
although the involvement of multiple signals and their
effectors such as katp and kca channels in btb permeability
regulation has been demonstrated, the contribution from each
of them requires being determined under different pathophysiological conditions that affect their activity and/or expression. for brain tumor studies, there are different tumor models
such as c6, rg2, 9l, gl26, and u87 which may be further
developed as syngeneic or non-syngeneic animal models.
bradykinin (bk) and its analog, rmp-7 (cereport), selectively
increase brain tumor permeability and drug delivery across the
btb (black and chio, 1992; inamura and black, 1994; matsukado

199

et al., 1998; nomura et al., 1994). the b2 receptors of bk are
found to be differentially expressed in c6, rg2 and 9l tumor
models, and the expression patterns are consistent with
different increases in bk-mediated btb permeability (liu et
al., 2001). in addition, in clinical trials, difference in  xxxg11xxx   xxxg258xxx 
expression in tumors has been regarded as a major reason for
the significant variability in the effect of cereport on the btb
permeability in patients with malignant brain tumors (matsukado et al., 1998). these findings suggest that modulation of
btb permeability can be significantly affected by the activity
and/or expression levels of the target protein(s) for a modulator
drug.
in the present study, we sought to determine whether the
effects of katp and kca channel agonists on btb permeability
are different between syngeneic and non-syngeneic rat brain
tumor models and whether the differences, if any, are related
to differential expression of katp and/or kca channels. the
expression patterns of katp and kca channels and the effects
of their agonists on tumor permeability were examined in
experimentally-induced 9l gliosarcoma implanted in fisher
(syngeneic model) and wistar (non-syngeneic model) rats. the
mrna levels of  xxxg1253xxx  were also examined for nineteen
glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) surgical specimens. furthermore, we have previously shown that vaccinated patients
receiving subsequent chemotherapy exhibited significantly
longer times to tumor recurrence relative to their own
previous recurrence times after chemotherapy (wheeler et
al., 2004). in this study, the mrna levels of  xxxg1253xxx  were
examined in the paired gbm tissues from seven patients
before and after vaccination therapy that have been reported
by wheeler et al. (2004).

effects of katp or kca channel agonists on tumor
permeability in syngeneic and non-syngeneic rat brain
tumor models
our previous studies suggest that the agonists of katp or kca
channels increase btb permeability in certain rat brain tumor
models (ningaraj et al., 2002, 2003a,b). here we sought to
determine whether the effects of  xxxg1232xxx  agonists
on btb permeability were different between syngeneic and
non-syngeneic rat brain tumor models. 9l gliosarcomas is
originally derived from fisher rats. the cells were implanted
into fisher rat brain for our syngeneic model and wistar rat
brain for our non-syngeneic model. the tumor size of 9l
gliosarcomas was similar and comparable between the two
models (h&e staining; data not shown). the permeability of
brain tumor was determined by autoradiography of [14c]sucrose measured in the tumor, as described before (inamura
and black, 1994; nomura et al., 1994).
six days following implantation of 9l gliosarcomas in fisher
and wistar rats, the effects of  xxxg1253xxx  agonist (kco912
and ms) on brain regional tumor permeability were examined.
intravenous infusion of kco912 (75 mug/kg/min) (n = 5) resulted
in a significant increase in 9l tumor permeability, ki, over the
pbs treatment (n = 7) in the non-syngeneic model (2-fold
higher, p b 0.01, 10.9 ± 4.42 vs. 5.56 ± 1.33 mul/g/min), while there

200

br a i n r es e a rc h 1 2 2 7 ( 2 00 8 ) 1 9 8 –20 6

was only a slight trend of ki increase by kco912 in the
syngeneic model (1.4-fold higher, p = 0.038, 10.8 ± 1.17 vs. 7.88 ±
2.79 mul/g/min) (figs. 1a and b). co-infusion of  xxxd2215xxx , a
katp antagonist, abolished the increase in tumor permeability
by kco912 in the non-syngeneic model (fig. 1c). consistent
with the results of kco912, another  xxxg1253xxx  agonist,
minoxidil sulfate (180 mug/kg/min) (n = 6) also caused a significant increase in tumor ki (2.1-fold higher, p b 0.01, 11.7 ± 2.21 vs.
5.56 ± 1.33 mul/g/min) in the non-syngeneic model with no
significant effect in the syngeneic model (1.3-fold higher,
p = 0.053, 10.8 ± 1.17 vs. 7.88 ± 2.79 mul/g/min) (fig. 1b).
the effect of a kca channel agonist, ns-1619, on tumor
permeability was also compared between the two rat brain

tumor models. in contrast to the effects by the  xxxg1253xxx 
agonists, intravenous infusion of ns-1609 (60 mug/kg/min)
significantly increased tumor permeability in both nonsyngeneic and syngeneic animal models (p b 0.05 versus
pbs-treated control). however, the increase in the nonsyngeneic model was more significant than in the syngeneic
model (2.4-fold increase in 9l tumor of wistar rats versus
1.7-fold increase in 9l tumor of fischer rats, p b 0.05) (fig. 2a
and b). bradykinin has been previously demonstrated to
enhance tumor permeability in animal models (inamura and
black, 1994; nomura et al., 1994). in this study, it was noted
that bradykinin increased ki in our two models to a similar
extent when compared with the pbs-treated control. the
permeability in normal brain tissue (2 mm beyond the
tumor border) and those of surrounding the tumor (within
2 mm of the border of the tumor) was not altered by the
infusion of any of the vasomodulators (data not shown).
bradykinin and the  xxxg1232xxx  agonists did not alter
blood pressure in the animals. under the experimental
conditions in this study, brain and tumor tissue blood
volumes should not significantly altered by bradykinin
(black et al., 1990; inamura et al., 1994; liu et al., 2001;
nomura et al., 1994) and the  xxxg1232xxx  agonists.
however, the exact effect from those  xxxg1232xxx 
agonists requires further studying.

had similar expression patterns within the tumor and were
co-expressed in endothelial cells with factor viii, a marker
for vascular endothelia (figs. 4a and b). there were a few
kca or  xxxg1253xxx -immunopositive cells in the brain
parenchyma surrounding the tumor and in normal brain
tissue (fig. 4a and data not shown). the immunochemistry
staining indicated robust expression of both kca and katp
channels in the tumors from both animal models, however,
no difference in the expression pattern of either katp or kca
channels in tumors was found between the two animal
models (fig. 4).
in order to quantify if there is a difference in the level of
protein expression of katp or kca channels in brain tumors
between the two animal models, we performed western blot
analysis on tumor tissues. as shown in fig. 5, the protein
expression levels for both kca and katp channels were
significantly higher in wistar rats than those in fischer rats
(kca channels, 9l/wistar vs. 9l/fischer, 0.98 ± 0.05 vs. 0.31 ±
0.04, p b 0.0001, figs. 5a and b; and katp channels, 2.5 ± 1.02 vs.
0.84 ± 0.10, p b 0.05, figs. 5c and d). these results, in combination with those from above permeability studies, indicate a
positive correlation between expression levels of potassium
channels including kca and katp and the btb permeability
induced by those channel agonists.

expression of katp channels and kca channels in
non-syngeneic and syngeneic rat brain tumor models
we first sought to determine if 9l gliosarcoma cells grown
in vitro express both kca and katp channels by immunofluorescent labeling and western blot analysis. as shown in
fig. 3, both kca and katp channels were expressed in 9l
gliosarcoma cells. the expression of these channels was
then examined in experimentally-induced 9l gliosarcoma in
fischer and wistar rats. we also sought to determine if both
kca and katp channels were present in endothelial cells
within and surrounding the tumor. kca and katp channels

expression of katp channels in gbm of patients

in order to determine if katp channels are expressed in gbm
tissues from patients, we studied the mrna levels of katp
channels by real-time pcr. we first examined the mrna
levels of katp channels in gbm of nineteen patients, and found
that there was significant variation in the mrna levels of katp
channels among gbm patients (fig. 6a). next, in order to
determine the effect of immunoresponse on expression of
katp channels in gbm patients, we studied the mrna levels of
katp channels in paired gbm tissues from seven patients
before and after dendritic cell vaccination. of seven patients,
increased mrna levels of  xxxg1253xxx  in gbm were detected

discussion

the btb prevents the delivery of chemotherapeutics into brain
tumors. pharmacological modulation is a novel approach to

203

(9l glioma cells implanted in fisher rats) brain tumor models.
this is consistent with our observation of higher expression of
katp and kca channels in tumor tissue from the allogeneic rat
model. the approach of pharmacological modulation takes
advantage of the structural and functional characteristics of
btb that are different from those of the normal bbb. in this
study, the expression of both katp and kca channels was
robustly detected in tumor capillary endothelium and tumor
cells with much less expression in the brain parenchyma
surrounding the tumor and in normal brain tissue. as a result,
the agonists of both katp and kca channels increased the
permeability of tumors but not that of normal brain tissue. we
and others have previously demonstrated that btb permeability can be modulated via receptors, ion channels and
enzymes that are uniquely over-expressed in the tissue and
microvessels of brain tumors (black and ningaraj, 2004;
cloughesy and black, 1995; faraci and heistad, 1998; fenstermacher and cowles, 1977; groothuis et al., 1982; neuwelt et al.,
1982; ningaraj et al., 2002, 2003a,b; terasaki and pardridge,
2000). however, the expression and activity of those molecules
involved in the regulation of btb permeability can be altered

increase btb permeability for chemotherapeutics. we have
previously reported that the agonists of potassium channels
including katp and kca increase drug transport across btb
(ningaraj et al., 2002, 2003a,b). however, the magnitude of the
effect by those agonists was different among different rat
tumor models during our preliminary observation. in this
study, we particularly studied if the agonists of katp and kca
channels cause differential effects on btb permeability
between syngeneic and allogeneic rat tumor models. we also
examined the expression level of a  xxxg1232xxx , katp, in
surgical gbm specimens from patients.
our results demonstrate that both katp and kca channel
agonists enhance tumor permeability more in allogeneic
(9l glioma cells implanted in wistar rats) than in syngenic

by a variety of pathophysiological conditions including tumor
type, tumor grade and potentially the host immune response.
it remains unclear why there is the differential tumor
permeability and expression levels of katp and kca channels
between the syngeneic and non-syngeneic rat brain tumor
models. the expression of katp and kca channels was detected
in cultured 9l gliosarcoma cells which are derived from fisher
rats. however, after implantation, 9l gliosarcoma tissue, including capillary endothelium and tumor cells, expressed different
levels of both channels, with higher levels in allogeneic (wistar
rat) and lower levels in syngeneic (fisher rat) models. in view of
the fundamental differences between syngeneic and allogeneic
models, the immune status may be an important mechanism
acounting for differential expression of katp and kca channels.
interestingly, clinical studies suggest that immunotherapy
by vaccines in brain tumor patients enhances their sensitivity
to chemotherapy (wheeler et al., 2004; yu et al., 2004). the
mechanism remains unclear. it has been shown that after
vaccination with tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cells, patients
with malignant gliomas have significant infiltration of cd4+
and cd8+ t cells in tumor tissues (yu et al., 2004). although it is
quite speculative, the underlying mechanism may also be
related to alteration of gene expression of tumor permeabilityrelated molecules by immunotherapy. we have previously
shown that the activity of katp channels can regulate btb
permeability in rat brain tumor models (ningaraj et al., 2003b).
our animal results from syngeneic and allogeneic models
imply that katp channels may be a molecule of which
expression is altered by immunotherapy in brain tumor
patients. this is consistent with our findings in surgical gbm
specimens that the mrna levels of katp channels increased
after vaccination therapy for the majority of the patients (5 out
of 7 patients). more interestingly, the patients with the
increased katp expression turned out to have positive response
to chemotherapy after vaccination. further studies will be
required to test our hypothesis that immune status modulates
the expression of the critical molecules such as katp and kca
channels associated with brain tumor permeability. in this
study, we also found that the expression of katp channels is
very variable among gbm patients. further studies are also
required to address whether the variation accounts for any
inter-individual difference in response to chemotherapy.
in conclusion, the present study presents evidence that the
variable increases in btb permeability induced by potassium
channel agonists between syngeneic and allogeneic rat
models are directly related to  xxxg1232xxx  expression
levels, suggesting the importance of an appropriate animal
model to study the pharmacological modulation of btb
permeability. clinical studies of btb permeability should
also evaluate the variability in  xxxg1232xxx  expression
among patients and its role in determining individual
differences in response to chemotherapy.

experimental procedures

4.1.

materials

all animal experiments were conducted in accordance with
policies set by the institutional animal care and use commit-

tee in cedars-sinai medical center and by nih guidelines.
female fischer and wistar rats, weighting 150–180 g, were used
for this study. bradykinin, minoxidil sulfate (ms), and ns-1619
were obtained from the sigma co. (st. louis, mo), and kco912
from novartis pharma (switzerland). [14c]-sucrose (363 mci/
mmol; mw 342) was obtained from icn (dupont new england
nuclear, boston, ma).

4.2.

intracerebral tumor implantation

9l gliosarcoma cells were kept frozen until use, and then
thawed and maintained in a monolayer culture in dmem
medium with 10% fbs. the rats were anesthetized with
intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (50 mg/kg)/xylazine
(6 mg/kg), and immobilized in a stereotactic frame. a hamilton
syringe was lowered into the right basal ganglia to a depth of
4.5 mm from the dural surface, 3 mm lateral and 1 mm anterior
to the bregma, and was then withdrawn 0.5 mm to create a
space for tumor cell accumulation. intracerebral injections of
1 × 105 9l glioma cells in 5 mul of medium with 1.2%  xxxd2609xxx  were then administered over a period of 10 min. the skin
incision was closed using sterile surgical staples.

4.3.

animal preparation

for permeability studies the tumor-implanted rats were
divided into five groups as follows: (1) control group: treated
with intravenous infusion of saline; (2) bk group: treated with
intravenous infusion of bradykinin (120 mug/kg/min, dissolved
in 0.9% saline); bk is used as a positive control for btb
permeability studies; (3) kco912 group: treated with intravenous infusion of kco912; (4) ms group: treated with intravenous infusion of ms; (5) ns-1619 group: treated with
intravenous infusion of ns-1619. six days after tumor
implantation, the rats were again anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine. one femoral vein was cannulated for administration of the appropriate drugs and the radiotracer; one
femoral artery was cannulated to withdraw arterial blood, and
the other was cannulated to monitor systemic blood pressure.
body temperature was maintained at 37 °c, and arterial blood
gases, blood pressure and hematocrit were monitored. animals that showed any abnormal physiologic parameters were
eliminated from the study.

4.4.

tumor permeability study

the radiotracer used in this study was [14c] sucrose. either a
drug or saline was infused into the femoral vein at a rate of
66.7 mul/min for 15 min. five minutes after the start of the
intravenous infusion, 50 muci/kg of [14c] sucrose was injected as
an intravenous bolus. a peristaltic withdrawal pump was used
to withdraw femoral artery blood at a constant rate of
0.083 ml/min, immediately after injection of the tracer. this
blood was used for determination of serum radioactivity.
additional experiments were performed in wistar rats with 9l
tumor by infusing  xxxd2215xxx  (5 mug/kg/min) to investigate
whether inhibition of katp channels by  xxxd2215xxx  attenuates permeability increase induced by kco912. after completion of the experiments (15 min from the beginning of drug/
saline infusion or 10 min after tracer injection), the animals

br a i n r es e a rc h 1 2 2 7 ( 2 00 8 ) 1 9 8 –2 06

were euthanized by decapitation and the brains immediately
removed and frozen.

4.5.

quantitative autoradiography

the frozen brains were mounted onto pedestals with m1
embedding matrix, after which 20 mum coronal sections were
cut with a cryostat. the sections were thaw-mounted onto
slides, and autoradiographs were generated by exposing the
sections along tissue-calibrated 14c standards on a phosphor
screen for 5 days. the sequential sections were then stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (h&e) for histological correlation
of areas of tumor with autoradiographs. the regional radioactivity was measured in tumor, in brain surrounding the
tumor (bst; within 2 mm of the border of the tumor), in right
cortex (ipsilateral to tumor), left cortex, right white matter, left
white matter, right basal ganglia, and left basal ganglia.
quantitative analysis of the regional radioactivity was performed using a computer (power macintosh 7100) and image
1.55 software (national institutes of health, bethesda, md).

ki value calculation

regional permeability in normal brain and in the tumor
tissues was expressed by the unidirectional transfer constant,
ki value (mul/g/min). the initial rate for blood-to-brain transfer
was calculated using the following equation:
c  v0 cbl
ki ¼ rbrt
0 cpl d dt
where cbr is the brain or tumor concentration (dpm/g) of the
tracer at the end of the experiment, cbl is the blood concentration (dpm/g) of the tracer at the end of experiment, t (min) is
the duration of the experiment, and cpl is the arterial plasma
concentration of radiotracer (dpm/ml). v0 is the regional
cerebral blood volume in the tissue (mul/g), and dt denotes
integration over time. blood volumes (v0) of the 9l tumors were
derived from previously published studies (black et al., 1990;
inamura et al., 1994; liu et al., 2001; nomura et al., 1994).

confocal microscopy

immunoreactive visualization of kca or katp channels and vwf
was performed as described previously (ningaraj et al., 2002).
in brief, confocal images were captured using a leica true
confocal scanner spectrophotometer laser scanning confocal
microscope (inverted) equipped with argon (488 nm) and
krypton (568 nm) lasers (heidelberg, germany). fluorescent
signals for kca or katp channels expressed on brain sections
were visualized using the 488-nm argon laser line, and
fluorescent signals from factor viii were visualized using the
568-nm krypton laser line. fluorescence signals for flour -488
or -568 were displayed as green and red pseudocolor projections respectively or merged as overlay projections to visualize
possible colocalization of two different antigens within a
specific subcellular structure.

4.9.

western blot analysis

tumor cells, tumor tissue and normal brain were rapidly
homogenized in 200 mul of lysis buffer [1% sds, 1.0 mm sodium
vanadate, 10 mm tris (ph 7.4)]. after centrifugation for 10 min
at 16,000 g, the supernatant was separated by electrophoresis
on a 10% sds-polyacrylamide gel, and electrotransferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane (imobilon; millipore, bedford, ma).
non-specific binding sites were blocked in tbs with 5% bsa
and 0.1% tween-20 for 1 h. membranes were rinsed for 30 min
in washing buffer (0.1% tween-20 in tbs) and then incubated
with anti-kca (1:1000) and anti- xxxg1250xxx  (1:1000), followed by antirabbit igg horseradish peroxidase-conjugate; or with anti-actin
(1:1000), followed by anti-mouse igg horseradish peroxidaseconjugate. all primary and secondary antibodies were obtained
from santa cruz biotechnology (santa cruz, ca). after rinsing
with the washing buffer, the immunocomplexes were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ecl kit (amersham
biotech inc., piscataway, nj) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. the signals in the film were digitally scanned and
then quantified using nih image software.

gbm tissues and vaccination therapy in patients

immunohistochemistry

the brain was removed immediately after decapitation and
fixed in ice-cold fixative solution of 4% freshly prepared
paraformaldehyde containing 10% sucrose. coronal section
(20 mum) was cut on a cryostat, mounted to geletin-coated slides
and processed for immunohistochemistry. kca and katp
channels in tumor sections were localized with anti-kca or
anti-  xxxg1253xxx  antibody (against a  xxxg1250xxx  subunit). to
determine whether kca or katp channels are present on
capillary endothelial cells, the brain tumor sections were
also incubated with polyclonal anti-factor viii primary antibodies. the colocalization of kca or katp channels and factor
viii was accomplished with anti-rabbit igg conjugated with
fluorescent (fict) and anti-mouse igg conjugated with
rhodamine (tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate), respectively. the negative control was performed by excluding the
primary antibodies in incubations. the immunostaining was
analyzed under a confocal-laser-scanning microscope as
described below.

the gbm tissue collection and clinical trial were conducted
and approved in accordance with policies set by the irb in
cedars-sinai medical center. the detail clinical trial for
vaccination therapy in gbm patients were described elsewhere (wheeler et al., 2004). in brief, seven patients suffered
from de novo gbm were provided informed consent to
treatments and associated monitoring. patients underwent
craniotomy before receiving the vaccine therapy. vaccinated
patients were steroid-free during blood collection. the
patients received three vaccines, 2 weeks apart, of 10–40 × 106
autologous dendritic cells loaded with either hla-eluted
peptides from cultured tumor cells or 150 mug/ml autologous
tumor freeze-thaw lysate, starting approximately 15 weeks
after surgery. serial magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scans
were performed every 2–3 months for all patients for
continuous monitoring. after vaccination, these patients
underwent another craniotomy at the time of recurrence of
gbm. gbm tissues obtained in the surgery before and after
vaccination were processed for real time pcr study.

real-time pcr

total cellular rna was extracted from glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) of patients using trizol reagent (invitrogen,
carlsbad, ca) according to the manufacturer's protocol. one
microgram (1 mug) of total rna was reverse-transcribed into
cdna using iscript™ cdna synthesis kit (bio-rad laboratories,
hercules, ca). cdna was stored at −20 °c until use. targeting
gene primers ( xxxg1253xxx , pph01409a.) were purchased from
superarray (frederick, md).  xxxg861xxx  is used as the internal
control. dural-color, real time quantitative rt-pcr was performed using the method of sybr green (bio-rad laboratories,
hercules, ca). the mrna expression levels of target genes
were normalized by  xxxg861xxx  expression in different samples.

4.12.

statistical analysis

results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (sd),
where applicable. the statistical analyses of ki, kca or katp
expression between different groups, with or without drug
treatment, were performed using anova, followed by either
unpaired student's t test of parametric analysis or the mann–
whitney u test of nonparametric analysis. a p-value of b 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
