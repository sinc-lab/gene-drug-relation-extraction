conformational analyses have been performed on several phenothiazine and thioxanthene dopamine
antagonists using the mm2-87 program and parameter set. the compounds that were examined
are thioridazine (2),  xxxd2474xxx  (3), cis- and  xxxd1679xxx , and a piperidylidene
derivative of  xxxd1679xxx . in addition, (+)-2 and (-1-3 were determined by x-ray crystallography
to have the r absolute configuration. the above compounds were superimposed onto  xxxd2511xxx ,
which was used as a template for the previously proposed  xxxg656xxx  ligand model.
the conformational properties and receptor affinities of these compounds were found to be entirely
consistent with the ligand model. for example, a conformer of (+)-r-2that is consistent with the
ligand model is lower in energy than a consistent conformer for (-)-s-2, which agrees with the
higher  xxxg656xxx  affinity of the former. similarly, in agreement with the much higher affinity
of (-)-r-3 relative to (+)-s-3,only the former contains a low energy conformer consistent with the
ligand model. the ligand model is also consistent with the greater potency of cis-thioxanthenes
over the trans isomers. these results emphasize the importance of the correct orientation of the
ammonium hydrogen for high affinity at the  xxxg656xxx . the pharmacophore for  xxxg656xxx 
ligands is compared with a recently proposed pharmacophore for d1 ligands.

figure 1. conformation found for (+)-(r)-thioridazine(2) by x-ray crystallography. the conformer is e-143,73,-143,-1741 11.

this distance appeared to have atypical properties or
structure-activityrelationships. it was also concluded that
the ligand requirements for d1 and d2 receptors are quite
similar in that all of these conformationally restricted
compounds had similar affinities a t both receptor types.
a similar ligand model for dopamine antagonism has been
proposed by liljefors and bergesnr.l3j4
as indicated above, a phenothiazine such as 1 has
considerable conformational flexibility. there are four
torsion angles in 1 that can affect its three-dimensional
structure. each torsion angle can assume a trans and two
gauche values, resulting in 81 possible combinations of
the four dihedral angles. in addition, the nonplanar
tricyclic phenothiazine structure can invert, doubling the
number of distinct conformers to 162. to limit the
possibilities, this work has focused on the chiral phenothiazines thioridazine ( 2 ) and  xxxd2474xxx  (3).
it has recently been shown that both enantiomers of 2
have considerable affiiity for dopamine receptors but with
different stereosele~tivities.~~
the (+)-enantiomer has a
3-fold greater affinity for d2 receptors whereas the (-)enantiomer has a 10-foldgreater affinity for d1 receptors.
for 3, there is a 45-fold difference in affinity for d2
receptors and a 14-fold difference in affinity for d1
receptors, both in favor of the (-)-enantiomer (also known
as le~omeprornazine).~6j7in thioxanthenes, the introduction of a double bond between the tricyclic structure
and the side chain results in geometrical isomers and
reduces the conformational freedom. it has been found
that cis isomers (relative to a substituent on the tricyclic
structure) are invariably more potent than their trans
counterparta.ls calculations are also reported fok cis-(4)
and tram- xxxd1679xxx  and a rigid analog of the
thioxanthenes (&.lo also, as part of this project, the
absolute configurations of the enantiomersof 2 and 3 have
been determined by x-ray crystallography.
an important assumption that is made in this study is
that the biologically active conformer of these compounds
should have a relatively low energy although the binding
energy of these ligands to dopamine receptors is generally
much higher than the energy differences between conformers. however, requiring that a substantial amount
of energy be put into a compound to achievethe biologically
active conformer should result in a weakening of the
ligand-receptor complex and much lower affinity for the
receptor. also, focusingon enantiomeric compounds such
as 2 and 3offers an important advantage in conformational
studiesof receptor ligands sinceenantiomershave identical
physicochemical properties. thus, any differences in
receptor affinity are likely to be due to the ability of the
different enantiomersto achieve the required biologically

active form. this should provide a relatively stringent
test of the previously proposed ligand model.

results and discussion
the atomic numbering scheme for 2 is shown in figure
1and similar numbering schemes are used for 3-5. the
side chains of these compounds are a function of four
torsion anglesand different conformations of the side chain
will be denoted as [71,~2,73,~41
(scheme i). for 2 71 is
defined as c12-cll-nlo-cla, 72 as c13-cl2-cll-nl0,
73 as n14-cl3-cl2-cl1, and 74 c15-nl4-cl3-cl2.
for 3 and 4, which have equivalent n-methyl groups, 74
will be given with respect to both n-methyl groups. in
addition, the tricyclic structure in these compounds is
nonplanar and a s u f f i x of i or i1will be appended to indicate
which of the two mirror image conformations of the tricyclic
structures is indicated. folding i, in which the convex
side of the tricyclic structure is upward when the substituted phenyl ring is on the left, is required by the ligand
model for d2 antagonists.
the structure observed for (+)-2 crystallized as a
fumarate salt is shown in figure 1and the final refined
coordinates are given in tables i and 11. the conformation
of the crystal structure is [60,73,-131,-1741 i1 and the
absolute configuration is r . thus, the (+)-enantiomer
preferred by d2 receptors has the r configuration while
the (-)-enantiomer preferred by d1 receptors has the s
configuration. these assignments are in agreement with
their recent determination through the stereospecific
synthesis of chemical intermediate^.'^ the crystal conformation for (+)-2 differs from that observed for the
racemic free base of 2 where the r-enantiomorph was found
in the [-66,-170,51,1791 i conformation and the s-enantiomorph in the [-128,169,-54,-1791 i1 conformation.20
these two conformers are closelyrelated since the mirror
image of the latter, which is also present in the crystal, is
[-6o,-169,54,179] i. the crystal structure for the free base
of (-1-3 is 1-70,165,-65,163 (-76)l i and is shown in figure
2. this is essentially the same conformer as found
previously21*22
(coordinates are not given) and confirms
the assignment of the r configuration to the (-)-enantiomer.21
the results of the conformational energy calculations
for (+)-r-2,(-)-r-3,and cis- and tram-4 are listed in tables
iii-v. more detailed conformational information on the
global minima, the biologically active conformers (see
below), and the crystal structures are given in tables viviii. the computed globalminimum for (+)-r-2is similar
to ita crystal conformation while the conformer for (-)r-3 that is most similar to the crystal conformation is 0.8

kcal/mol above the global minimum. the computed
conformer most similar to those observed by crystallography for the free bases of racemic 220and ~ i s - are
4 ~ 1.6
and 1.3 kcal/mol above the global minima, respectively.
thus, all of the crystal conformers are computed to have
reasonably low energies.
of the three compounds, 3 appears to have the most
restricted conformational space, with only 10 conformers
that are within 3 kcal/mol of the global minimum. half
of these have folding i while the other half have folding
11. for 2, there are 10 conformers with folding i and 8
conformers with folding i1 that are within 3 kcal/mol of
the global minimum. the side chain in cis- and trans-4
appears to have the most flexibility with 18 conformers
within 3 kcal/mol for each folding of the tricyclic structure.
it can be seen from table v that the difference in the

position of the 2 4 1 between cis- and trans-4 has only a
minor effect on the conformational energy differences. it
should be noted that for cis- and trans-4, each conformer
with folding i has a corresponding mirror image conformer
withfoldingi1. for 3, there are corresponding conformers
with foldings i and i1 due to the minor effect of the
2-substituent on the computed conformational energy.
this is less true for 2 due to the bulky nature of the
piperidine ring, which intelqgcts differently with the
different foldings of the tricyclic structure.
with respect to 71 for the phenothiazines, one of the
minima in the energy surface is in the vicinity of 80' for
folding i and -80' for folding 11. however, these conformers are much less favorable, and none of the lowenergy forms listed in tables i11 and iv have this value.
these values of 71 are also associated with a flattening of
the phenothiazine structure with the angle between the
two phenyl planes going from about 135' for the lowenergy conformers to about 150-160'. for the thioxan0 for the
thenes, 71 is restricted to the vicinity of '
biologically active cis-compounds and to 180' for the less
active trans compounds. combining the results for the
phenothiazines and thioxanthenes, it appears that the
biologically active form of the phenothiazines must have
71 = -60' with the required folding i since conformers
with 71 = 60' are unfavorable.
with regard to 73, values of this dihedral angle appear
to be restricted for 2 depending on the enantiomer. for
(+)-r-2, values in the vicinity of -60' are less favorable.
conformers with this value of r3, when they are stable,
are consistently less favorable than other values and 73 is

displaced to about -looo. this appears to be due to steric
interactions between the n-methyl group of the piperidine
ring with the atoms of the side chain. for (-)-s'-2,
conformers with 73 = +60° are less favorable and displaced
to about +looo for the same reason. this conformational
difference may be responsible for the enantiomeric difference in affinity for d2 receptors (see below).
with regard to 74, there are some additional regularities
for those compounds with two equivalent n-methylgroups
(3and 4). conformers in which both n-methyl groups are
gauche are somewhat less favorable. for 2, 74 is part of
the piperidine ring and has a value of about 180° for the
optimal conformer in which all of the groups attached to
the piperidine ring are equatorial.
some calculationswere also performed on the semirigid
thioxanthene analog 6. for a given folding of the tricyclic
structure, the piperidine ring can invert. for folding i,

one of the goale of this work is to explain the pharmacology of  xxxg656xxx  antagonists in terms
of their molecular structures. among the issues that will
be addressed are the following: (1)why does (+)-r-2have
3 times the affinity of (-)-5'-2 for d2 receptors? (2) why
does (-143-3 have 46 times the affmity of (+)-s-3 for d2
receptors? (3) why does the activity of the thioxanthenes
(4) mainly reaide in the cis isomers rather than the trans
isomers? the previously proposed d2 ligand model will
be used to provide a framework, and the ability to answer
these questionssuccessfullywill be a measure of its succw.

w i l l be used as a template with each of the low-energy

conformers being superimposedonto it in a least-squares
sense. it should be noted that, in addition to this root

mean square (rrns) fit, an additional factor that will be
important is the requirement that the ammonium hydrogens of the conformers point in the same general
direction. finally, as discussed above, the biologically
active conformer should have low energy to maintain high
affinity for the  xxxg656xxx .
the low-energy conformers of (+)-r-2that are within
3 kcal/mol of the global minimum are listed in table 111.
since the ligand model requires folding i, only those with
this fold will be considered. however, the mirror image
of conformers of (+)-r-2 with folding i1are conformers of
(343-2 with folding i with identical energies. while all
of the conformers listed in the table correspond to (+)r-2,the rrns fita listed under folding i1 actually refer to
the equivalent conformer of (343-2 with folding i. this
has also been done for 3 in table iv.
a number of low-energy conformers of (+)-r-2 appear
to be a good r m s fit to 6. however, upon visual inspection,
only the conformer [-53,173,173,1791 i (figure 4a) preserves the correct orientation of the ammonium hydrogen
and is, therefore, proposed as the biologically active form.
this conformer is 1.3 kcal/mol above the global minimum
and has a rms fit of 0.31 a. with regard to the (-)-s-2
conformers, none of those listed in the table is both a good
fit and has the correct orientation of the ammonium
hydrogen. one possibility for the biologically active form
of (-)-s-2 is the conformer [-53,176,102,1801 i (figure4b).
this conformer has a rms fit of 0.30 a and does have the
correct orientation of the ammonium hydrogen. however,
due to steric interactions between the n-methyl and the
side chain, the energy of this conformer is 1.9 kcal/mol
above that of the conformer shown in figure 4a. this
could account for ita lessened affinity for d2 receptors.
an alternative is that another conformer,with lower energy
but which does not fit the ligand model as well, is
responsible for the biological activity.
for (-143-3, only the conformer [-54,178,178,64 (-17313
i (figure5) appears to meet the requirements of the ligand
model. this conformer is 1.2 kcaymol above the global
minimum and has an rms fit of 0.29 a. none of the lowenergy conformers of (+)-s-3 appear to meet the requirementa of the ligand model. as can be seen from figures

for cis-4, theconformer 1-3,113,179,67 (-17011 i (figure

an energy 0.4 kcal/mol above the global minimum, an rms

fit of 0.37 a, and the correct orientation of the ammonium
hydrogen. for trans-4, none of the conformers appear to
meet the criteria. a conformer such as [175,-106,-98,

by a semirigid derivative.am
that accounts for the much lower activity of the trans
isomers is the inability to achieve the correct orientation
of the ammonium hydrogen in a low-energy conformer.
the conformer shown in figure 3 appears to be the
biologically active form for 5 since the rms fit is 0.11 a for
superimposingit onto 6. this indicates a very close fit
and the orientation of the ammonium hydrogen is consistent with the ligand model. a question has been raised
as to why cis-thioxanthenes are more active than trans
isomers if both should be able to assume the conformation
represented in figure 3 equally well.lo the apparent
answer to this is that the biologically active form of cis-4
does not appear to correspond exactly to the structure of
5. for cis-4, the active form appears to be [-3,113,179,67
(-17o)l i while that for 5 is [1,120,59,176 (-6o)i i. the
conformer for cis-4 that most closely corresponds to 5 is
2.9 kcal/mol above the global minimum and 2.5 kcal/mol
above the biologically active form. thus, the effect of the
piperidylidene ring is to force 5 into a conformation that
is not easily attainable by open chain analogs like cie- or
trans-4.
the affinity of a ligand for a receptor site can be directly
related to its free energy of binding to the site. for
dopamine antagonists with typical properties, the free
energy of binding is primarily due to a large increase in
entropy.su nevertheless, the energy of the biologically
active form relative to its global minimum should be an
important factor in the enthalpy of binding. that is,
everything else being taken as equal, the ligand-receptor
complex should be weakened for a ligand in which several
kcal/mol are required to assume the biologically active
form. in thiswork, differencesin receptor affmity between
two pairs of enantiomersand one pair of close geometrical
isomers have been related to their ability to assume the
biologically active form as defined by the previously

proposed ligand model.12 for the d2 antagonists studied
here, this analysis appears to be entirely successful. a
reason for this success may be that one is comparing
receptor affinities between pairs of enantiomers or close
geometrical isomers since each pair will have either
identical or very similar physicochemical properties. in
addition, many, if not most, of the interactions that each
ligand in the pair will make with the receptor site will be
identical. thus, one would not expect to be able to explain
differences in receptor affinity between (-)-2 and (-)-3 in
this way since the two compounds differ in the nature of
the 2-substituent, among other things, and this is an
important factor in d2 antagonist activity.'
recently, a pharmacophore for d1 antagonist activity
has been defined using a semirigid benzazepine that has
considerably less conformational flexibility than the
original d1 selective benzazepines.m*m the energyminimized structure for this compound is shown in figure
7. the distance between the ammonium nitrogen in this
compound is considerably smaller (-4.3 a) as compared
with most d2 antagonists (-6.1 a). however, this
difference may not be crucial since all of the compounds
used to define the d2 pharmacophore for which d1
receptor affhity has been measured also have considerable
affinity for d1 receptors.12 the structure of the benzazepines does appear to be uniquely favorable for binding
to d1 receptors since the compoundsgenerallyhave higher
affinity for d1 receptors than other classes of dopamine
antagonists.17~31
it would be of interest to compare the pharmacophore
for d1 antagonist activity, as represented by figure 7,
with that for d2 antagonist activity. however, due to the
much smaller distance between the ammonium nitrogen
and the substituted phenyl ring in the benzazepines, none
of the possible lease squares superpositions appears to be

2226 journal of medicinal chemietry, 1993, vol. 36, no. 15

froimowitz and cody

entirely satisfactory. a plausible way to align the ligand
models for d2 and d1 antagonist activity is in the
orientations shown in figures 3 and 7,since this preserve
a similar orientation of the ammonium hydrogen, which
does appear to be a crucial factor.12 the d1 selectivity of
the benzazepines then appears to be due to the steric
interference of the unsubstituted phenyl ring which
occupies considerable space that is unoccupied in d2
antagonists. the presence of this phenyl ring is crucial
for the d1 selectivity of the benzazepines.32
one would also like to be able to explain the 10-fold
higher affinity of (-)-s-2 over (+)-r-2 for d1 receptors.
this favorability of ( 3 3 - 2 for d1 receptors appears to be
due to intrinsicmolecular factors for this enantiomer rather
than just a decrease of d1 affinity by (+)-r-2.16j7 this
argues strongly against the energetically unfavorable
conformer in figure 4b being responsible for the d1
receptor affinity of (-)-s-2, however, it was not possible
to decide which of the other low-energy conformers is
responsible for its  xxxg655xxx  activity due to the differences in the geometries of the compoundsdiscussed above.

various other moities. however, asthe calculations are performed
in the absence of solvent, which precludes intermolecular
hydrogen bonding, it appears that the intramolecular hydrogen
bonding is unrealistic and it was turned off. this results in much
better agreement between calculations and experimentally
observed conformers for a number of mo1ecules.m
the least-squares superposition studies of the various compounds was performed with the pcmodel program. superposition was with respect to the ammonium nitrogen and the six
atoms of the substituted phenyl ring taking into account the
position of the 2-substituent.

a nonius cad4 automated diffractometer was used to collect
the crystallographic data. the crystals were stable and showed
no deterioration. data were corrected for lorentz, polarization,
and extinction effects, but not for absorption. the structures
were solved using the direct methods programs multan and
n&est.&p~~
anomalous scattering curves were taken from the
international tab1ea.a for (+)-2 fumarate, there were 2607
unique reflections, of which 2406 had z > 2u. the r factor for
the r-enantiomorph was 0.054 as compared with 0.060 for the
5'-enantiomorph. for the free base of (+3, there were 2166
unique reflections of which 1967 has z > 2u. the r factor for the
r-enantiomorph was 0.049 as compared with 0.060 for the
s-enantiomorph.

conclusions
the conformational and pharmacological properties of
the enantiomers of 2 and 3 and the geometrical isomers
of 4 appear to be entirely consistent with the previously
proposed ligand model for d2 antagonists. for 2, where
the (+)-&enantiomer has 3 times the affinity of the (-1s-enantiomer, a low-energy conformer with the correct
molecular geometry is more accessible for the former. for
3, where the (-)-r-enantiomer has 45 times the affinity of
the (+)-s-enantiomer, only the former has a low-energy
conformer consistent with the ligand model. for cis-4, a
low-energy conformer is consistent with the ligand model
while for trans-4, the best conformer is 3.0 kcal/mol above
the global minimum. as before, the crucial element for
the ligand model appears to be the orientation of the
ammonium hydrogen. these results also are consistent
with the hypothesis that the relative energy of the
biologically active conformer is an important factor in the
activity of pharmacological compounds.
experimental section
molecular mechanics studies. the calculations were
performed with the mm2-87 program and parameter set.aava
energy minimizations were performed with respect to all internal
degrees of freedom. the initial cartesian coordinates for the
energy minimizations were generated by either a previously
described program,s by the pcmodel program," or by utilizing
the driver option of the mm2-87 program. the convergence
criterion was set a t '/a of its default value to ensure complete
convergence.
there were a number of missing parameters for sulfur and
nitrogen bonded to a phenyl ring, most of which were obtained
from the literature.*'* there were three remaining missing
torsional parameters. those for c&2@-n@-cw2 and h - c e nw-cw were approximated from the torsional parameters ui
which the clp2 is replaced by c , e for s-clp&,p-n~, the v2
and v3 terms were set to 16.25 and 2.0, respectively.
the calculations were performed on the protonated forms of
the molecules with a dielectric constant of 80 to approximate an
aqueous solution. to minimize the interaction between the side
chain and the flexible 2-substituents of 2 and 3,the 2-substituents
were rotated away from the side chain and they generally stayed
in that conformation. there was a small preference of the
thiomethyl group of 2 tobe on the convex side of thephenothiazine
structure. during the course of the energy minimizations, it was
realized that some conformers were being stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the protonated nitrogen and
