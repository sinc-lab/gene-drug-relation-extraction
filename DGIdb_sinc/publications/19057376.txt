abstract: background: in most cases of hyponatremia,  xxxd3495xxx  secretion is inappropriately high. this placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind multicenter study evaluated the efficacy and
safety of oral  xxxd1747xxx , a v1a/v2-receptor antagonist, in patients with
euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia. methods: eighty-three patients with serum [na⫹] less than 130 meq/l were stratified by volume
status and randomly assigned to placebo or  xxxd1747xxx  40 or 80 mg/d
for 5 days. results:  xxxd1747xxx  increased the baseline-adjusted area
under the serum [na⫹]-time curve significantly more than placebo
(p ⫽ 0.0001). patients given either dose of  xxxd1747xxx  demonstrated a
serum [na⫹] of 4 meq/l or greater above baseline significantly faster
than those given placebo (p ⬍ 0.001) and maintained that increase for
a greater total time (p ⫽ 0.0001). the least squares mean change in
serum [na⫹] from baseline to end of treatment was also significantly
greater with  xxxd1747xxx  40 and 80 mg/d (6.8 and 8.8 meq/l, respectively) (p ⫽ 0.0001) than that with placebo (1.2 meq/l). the percentage of patients who obtained an increase from baseline in serum [na⫹]
of 6 meq/l or greater or normal serum [na⫹] was significantly higher
among patients given  xxxd1747xxx  40 and 80 mg/d (67% and 88%,
respectively) than among those given placebo (20%; p ⬍ 0.001).
 xxxd1747xxx  was well tolerated; the most frequent adverse events were
urinary tract infection, anemia, pyrexia, cardiac failure, hypotension, and
hypokalemia. conclusion: oral  xxxd1747xxx  was effective in increasing serum
[na⫹] in patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia and had
a favorable safety profile.

yponatremia, defined as a serum sodium concentration
([na⫹]) less than 135 meq/l (⬍135 mmol/l), is a common
electrolyte disturbance, particularly among elderly patients who
are hospitalized or living in long-term care facilities.1– 4 in acutely
developing (ie, ⬍48 hours) hyponatremia, particularly when serum [na⫹] declines below 120 meq/l, severe consequences can
occur, including seizures, coma, brain damage, or even death.2,3,5,6

in most patients with mild chronic (developing over a period ⬎48
hours) hyponatremia, the disorder seems clinically asymptomatic.2,7 however, patients with chronic hyponatremia may display
subtle neurologic symptoms, such as cognitive impairment.7 in a
case-control study of patients presenting to a medical emergency
department, those with mild, clinically asymptomatic, chronic
hyponatremia had a significantly higher risk of falls, possibly due
to gait and attention impairments.7
the need to correct serum [na⫹] must be balanced
against the risks of an overly rapid correction, which can cause
osmotic demyelination, particularly in chronic or severe hyponatremia, liver disease, hypoxia, malnutrition, or alcoholism.2,8,9 in hyponatremia, a controlled increase of serum [na⫹]
(up to 12 meq/l per day) is recommended to avoid the adverse
effects potentially associated with overly rapid correction.2,8
chronic asymptomatic hyponatremia is usually treated with
fluid restriction and with concurrent treatment for the underlying cause.1,2 unfortunately, for many patients, long-term fluid
restriction is difficult to maintain. other treatments, such as
demeclocycline, urea, or furosemide combined with salt supplements, may also have challenges.10 patients with symptomatic hyponatremia may be given both a loop diuretic, to increase free water clearance (fwc), and hypertonic saline, to
replace the sodium lost with the diuresis.1,2 in addition, an intravenous (iv) formulation of  xxxd1747xxx  has been developed and
was recently approved for the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients.  xxxd1747xxx  iv is
not indicated for the treatment of congestive heart failure (chf).
however,  xxxd1747xxx  iv can be used to treat hyponatremia in
patients with chf.
in patients with hyponatremia, the plasma  xxxd3495xxx  (avp) level is often elevated.2 although avp remains osmotically regulated, nonosmotic factors, such as decreased effective circulating volume, also stimulate avp
secretion and are likely responsible for maintaining elevated
avp levels in the presence of low serum osmolality.11,12
previous studies have demonstrated the utility of avpreceptor antagonism in the treatment of hyponatremia related to
the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of  xxxd3495xxx 
(siadh),13–18 chf,16,18 and liver cirrhosis.8,16,18 –20  xxxd1747xxx  is
a nonpeptidic avp v1a/v2-receptor antagonist that produced
aquaresis—the solute-free, electrolyte-sparing excretion of water, which increases fwc, urine flow, and plasma osmolality—in animal models,21–25 healthy volunteers,26 a pilot
study of patients with advanced heart failure,27 and patients
with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia.28,29
presented here are the results of an independent placebocontrolled clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of
oral  xxxd1747xxx  40 and 80 mg/d in patients with euvolemic or
hypervolemic hyponatremia. because in vitro and in vivo stud-

3a4 leading to clinically significant increases in the systemic
exposure to these drugs, development of the oral formulation is
not being pursued. findings from the study reported here,
however, will be relevant to the clinical use of iv  xxxd1747xxx .

methods
this study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and its amendments and in compliance with
all applicable local and national laws and regulations. the
study protocol and informed consent document were approved
by an institutional review board or ethics committee at each site
prior to patient enrollment.
patients
men and women 18 years of age or older with serum
[na⫹] less than 130 meq/l, fasting blood glucose less than 126
mg/dl (7 mmol/l), and plasma osmolality less than 290
mosmol/kg h2o were eligible if they had euvolemic (absence
of pitting edema or ascites) or hypervolemic (edematous)
hyponatremia presumably related to nonosmotic secretion of
avp associated with underlying conditions (such as malignant
or nonmalignant diseases of the central nervous system, lung,
or abdomen; chf; or idiopathic cause). female patients were
either postmenopausal, surgically sterilized, or practicing a
barrier method of contraception in addition to using hormone
contraceptives and were ineligible if they were breast-feeding
or pregnant. patients were excluded if they had clinical evidence of volume depletion or dehydration, symptomatic hypotension, uncontrolled hypertension, arrhythmias requiring pacemaker placement or emergency treatment, untreated thyroid
disorders, adrenal insufficiency, known urinary outflow obstruction unless catheterized, serum creatinine greater than 2.7
mg/dl (238.7 ␮mol/l), proteinuria (⬎3 g urinary protein per
24 hours), an elevated liver enzyme level (⬎3 times the upper
limit of normal), bilirubin of 2.5 mg/dl or greater (42.8 ␮mol/l),
leukopenia (⬍3 ⫻ 103 white blood cells/␮l [3 ⫻ 109/l]), human
immunodeficiency virus infection, or active hepatitis. also ineligible were patients who had symptomatic hyponatremia, expected
to require emergent treatment of hyponatremia during the study, or
had any concurrent illness that could interfere with study treatment
or its evaluation. patients receiving avp, oxytocin, or desmopressin or drugs known to interact with  xxxg590xxx ,
including certain chemotherapeutic agents, calcium channel
blockers, statins, benzodiazepines, and class iii antiarrhythmic
drugs, were also excluded. medications used to treat siadh,
including lithium salts, urea, or demeclocycline, were discontinued for 1 week before screening. dosing for permitted medications, including diuretics, was stabilized before screening and
remained constant throughout the study. thiazide diuretics were
permitted if therapy with these agents was initiated at least 1
month before study enrollment.
study design
this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
study was conducted at 17 sites in 9 european countries
(belgium, finland, france, germany, italy, the netherlands,
poland, spain, and united kingdom). eligible patients at the
screening and baseline assessments were stratified according to
volume status and then randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to
undergo oral administration of  xxxd1747xxx  20 mg twice daily
(40 mg/d),  xxxd1747xxx  40 mg twice daily (80 mg/d), or placebo
for 5 days in the hospital. all patients were prescribed fluid
restriction (not to exceed 500 ml in any 3-hour period or 2.0 l
© 2009 lippincott williams & wilkins

in a 24-hour period for both oral and parenteral fluids) prior to
baseline and throughout the study, unless changes were necessary for safety reasons.
assessments
patients underwent screening for eligibility within 2
weeks of enrollment, including a medical history; physical
examination, including volume status and body weight assessments; and clinical laboratory testing. eligible patients entered
a 1-day baseline period during which single-blind placebo was
administered and baseline assessments were performed. patients qualified for randomization to treatment if their average
serum [na⫹] measured at 4, 6, and 12 hours of the baseline day
remained less than 132 meq/l and if their serum [na⫹] did not
increase by 8 meq/l or more during the first 12 hours of the
baseline day. during the baseline and treatment periods, each
patient’s fluid, sodium and potassium intake, thirst, volume
status, and body weight were monitored. daily sodium intake
and calorie consumption during treatment were to remain
consistent with observations at baseline. blood was collected
each day at 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours to determine serum [na⫹]
and other study parameters, including potassium and osmolality
levels. urine was collected for 24 hours during baseline assessment and on treatment days 1, 2, and 5 to determine urine
output, sodium, potassium, and osmolality. patients were also
evaluated 7 days after completing treatment.
efficacy and safety parameters
primary efficacy endpoint. the primary efficacy parameter
was the change from baseline in serum [na⫹] throughout the 5
days of treatment, as measured by the serum [na⫹] area under
the serum [na⫹]-time curve (auc). the serum [na⫹] auc
was corrected for the average serum [na⫹] measured during
baseline (hours 4, 6, and 12 and at the end, between hours 20
and 28) and calculated using the trapezoidal rule.
secondary efficacy endpoints. secondary efficacy parameters included the time to a confirmed increase from baseline in serum [na⫹]
of 4 meq/l or greater; the total time that serum [na⫹] was 4 meq/l or
more higher than the baseline value; the change in serum [na⫹] from
baseline to the end of treatment; and the number of patients who
demonstrated either a confirmed serum [na⫹] of 6 meq/l or greater
above baseline or normal serum [na⫹] (ⱖ135 meq/l). other efficacy
parameters included the change from baseline in fwc, effective water
clearance (ewc),30 –32 net fluid loss (24-hour total urine output—[24hour total iv ⫹ oral fluid intake]), urine osmolality, urine sodium, and
plasma osmolality and changes in avp levels and other neurohormones (plasma renin, aldosterone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine).
fwc and ewc were calculated as follows:

safety assessments. the safety assessment included adverse
events (aes), volume status, vital signs, electrocardiography,
and clinical laboratory tests as well as changes in body weight,
electrolytes, and thirst index. the severity of aes and their
relationship to study treatment were determined by the treating
investigator while still blinded to treatment. the rate and extent
of the serum [na⫹] correction were also assessed as a safety
parameter. an excessive increase was defined by changes in

29

annane et al

serum [na⫹] greater than 12 meq/l/d or greater than 24 meq/l
during the 5-day period or by an absolute serum [na⫹] greater
than 145 meq/l. in cases in which these limits were exceeded,
the investigators could administer additional fluid either orally
or parenterally, withhold the next scheduled dose of study
medication, or resume treatment at one half the original dose.
investigators were allowed to withdraw patients in cases of
protocol violation or serious or unexpected aes.
statistical analysis
based on data from pilot studies, a sample size of 84
patients—28 in each of the 3 treatment groups—was estimated
to provide 90% power to detect a difference in serum [na⫹]
auc of 130 meq 䡠 h/l between placebo and either  xxxd1747xxx 
dose. the sample size was calculated with the formula for the
t test for 2 independent groups.33 the sample size was calculated to account for a 20% discontinuation rate.
the primary and secondary efficacy parameters were
evaluated in all randomized patients who had a baseline serum
[na⫹] measurement, took at least 1 dose of study medication,
and had at least 1 valid follow-up measurement. for the
primary efficacy parameter, an analysis of covariance model,
with terms for treatment, study center, and volume status as
factors and baseline serum [na⫹] as the covariate, was used to
test for differences between placebo and  xxxd1747xxx  treatment.
the threshold of significance was 0.05, adjusted for
multiple comparisons with the dunnett test.34,35 the auc was
normalized by multiplying the measured auc by the ratio of
120 hours to the number of hours to the last observed efficacy
measurement. the treatment-by-baseline serum [na⫹], treatment-by-center, and treatment-by-volume status interactions
were examined at the 0.1 significance level.
the time to a confirmed increase of 4 meq/l or greater
from baseline in serum [na⫹] was analyzed using the log-rank
test, in which the patients were stratified by volume status. a
cox proportional hazards model, with terms for treatment,
center, and volume status as factors and baseline serum [na⫹]
as a covariate, was also used in this analysis. the total time
serum [na⫹] was 4 meq/l or more higher than baseline and the
change in serum [na⫹] from baseline to the end of treatment
were analyzed with the analysis of covariance in the same
manner as the primary efficacy parameter. the number of
patients who demonstrated a confirmed increase in serum
[na⫹] of 6 meq/l or greater from baseline or normal serum
[na⫹] was analyzed with the cochran-mantel-haenszel procedure, again with the patients stratified by volume status. all
other efficacy parameters were summarized according to treatment group with descriptive statistics. changes from baseline
in laboratory parameters, vital signs, body weight, and thirst
index were compared across treatment groups with a 2-way
analysis of variance, with terms for volume status and treatment. all other safety parameters were summarized by treatment group.

results
disposition and baseline characteristics
of patients
eighty-three patients were randomly assigned to undergo oral administration of  xxxd1747xxx  40 mg/d,  xxxd1747xxx  80
mg/d, or placebo and 72 patients (87%) completed the 5-day
study (figure 1). the baseline characteristics of the 3 groups
were similar (table 1). all patients were white, and most were
men (66%). overall, most patients (63%) had euvolemic hyponatremia at baseline, and the most common single causes of

30

hyponatremia were chf (33%), cancer (17%), and idiopathic
causes (16%).
the median duration of the current episode of hyponatremia was similar among the 3 treatment groups (4 –5 days), as
was the frequency of concomitant medication usage. the most
commonly used drugs were sulfonamides (used by 46%),
 xxxg36xxx  inhibitors (37%), heparins
(35%),  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors (33%), aldosterone antagonists
(31%), benzodiazepines (30%), and digitalis glycosides (22%).
the diuretics furosemide and spironolactone were used by 29%
and 33% of patients, respectively. thiazide diuretics were used
by 10% of patients.
efficacy
treatment with  xxxd1747xxx  produced a dose-dependent
and significantly greater increase in serum [na⫹] auc than did
placebo (p ⫽ 0.0001 for each dose). the least squares (ls)
mean ⫾ standard error (se) change from baseline in serum
[na⫹] auc during the 5-day treatment period was 88 ⫾ 81

40 mg/d, and 953 ⫾ 86 meq 䡠 h/l with  xxxd1747xxx  80 mg/d.
the difference in serum [na⫹] auc between the 2  xxxd1747xxx 
doses was also statistically significant (p ⫽ 0.028).
patients given either dose of  xxxd1747xxx  had a greater
and more rapid serum [na⫹] correction than did those given
placebo (figure 2). at hour 24 on day 5, the ls mean ⫾ se
increase from baseline in serum [na⫹] was significantly higher
with  xxxd1747xxx  40 mg/d (7.2 ⫾ 0.9 meq/l) and  xxxd1747xxx  80 mg/d
(9.1 ⫾ 0.9 meq/l) than with placebo (1.6 ⫾ 0.9 meq/l; p ⫽ 0.0001
versus both  xxxd1747xxx  groups).
overall, the median time from the first dose to a confirmed serum [na⫹] increase of 4 meq/l or greater from
baseline was 23.5 hours (95% ci: 12.0 –24.0) in the group
given  xxxd1747xxx  40 mg/d and 8.7 hours (95% ci: 4.0 –24.0) in
the group given  xxxd1747xxx  80 mg/d. both of these findings
were significantly different from those of the placebo group
(p ⫽ 0.0004 and 0.0001, respectively), in which a median time
was not estimable (too few patients in the placebo group
achieved an increase of 4 meq/l or greater during the 5-day
study). in addition, the ls mean ⫾ se total time during which
patients had an increase in serum [na⫹] of 4 meq/l or more
from baseline was significantly greater among patients given
 xxxd1747xxx  40 mg/d (68.8 ⫾ 6.4 hours) and 80 mg/d (86.6 ⫾
6.6 hours) than among those given placebo (20.3 ⫾ 6.4 hours;
p ⫽ 0.0001 versus both  xxxd1747xxx  groups).
the ls mean ⫾ se change in serum [na⫹] from
baseline to end of treatment was 1.2 ⫾ 0.8 meq/l in the
placebo group, 6.8 ⫾ 0.8 meq/l among patients given
 xxxd1747xxx  40 mg/d, and 8.8 ⫾ 0.9 meq/l among those given
 xxxd1747xxx  80 mg/d (p ⫽ 0.0001 versus both  xxxd1747xxx 
groups). similarly, the percentage of patients who responded to
treatment with a confirmed serum [na⫹] increase of 6 meq/l
or greater or normalized serum [na⫹] was significantly greater
among those given  xxxd1747xxx  40 mg/d (66.7%; p ⫽ 0.0008)
and 80 mg/d (88.5%; p ⬍ 0.0001) than among those given
placebo (20%). seven days after the study ended, the mean ⫾

was 2.0 ⫾ 4.0 meq/l among those given placebo (n ⫽ 15),

had a daily fluid intake of 1 to 2 l. four patients, 2 given
 xxxd1747xxx  80 mg/d and 2 given placebo, violated the 2-l/d
fluid restriction. the significant increases in serum [na⫹] in
both  xxxd1747xxx  treatment groups were not influenced by fluid
intake. the mean serum avp level increased above the normal
upper limit of 3.6 pg/ml in both  xxxd1747xxx  groups but decreased in the placebo group (table 2). in contrast, neither
 xxxd1747xxx  nor placebo produced clinically significant changes
in plasma aldosterone, norepinephrine, or epinephrine levels, or
renin activity.
safety
there were 5 deaths among the study population, 3
occurring in patients given placebo and 2 in patients given
 xxxd1747xxx  40 mg/d (table 3). three patients given placebo
died from acute myocardial infarction, postoperative bleeding,
and an unspecified cause, respectively. none of these deaths
were attributed to treatment. one patient given  xxxd1747xxx  40
mg/d, who had a significant history of severe pulmonary hypertension, died of acute heart failure on study day 3 because of

32

severe pulmonary hypertension. his death was considered possibly related to treatment, as he was hypovolemic at the time.
although volume depletion may have contributed to his cardiac
instability, he did not experience a too rapid increase in serum
[na⫹] (8 meq/l increase from baseline by day 2). the other
patient given  xxxd1747xxx  40 mg/d, who had a history of arrhythmia, heart failure, and hypertension, died from refractory heart
failure 3 days after completing the study. investigators determined
her death was not related to study drug.
serious aes occurred in 4 patients given placebo, 7
patients given  xxxd1747xxx  40 mg/d, and 2 patients given
 xxxd1747xxx  80 mg/d (table 3). two patients, each given
 xxxd1747xxx  40 mg/d, had a serious ae considered to be treatment related. one of these patients demonstrated elevated liver
transaminase levels on study day 3; no adjustments in study
medication were made and she recovered with residual effects
8 days after the last dose of study drug. the other patient had
fatal cardiac failure (previously described).
the rate of discontinuation for any reason was highest

failure, hypotension, and hypokalemia. in general, aes were
evenly distributed among the 3 treatment groups. the incidence of
hypotension and hypokalemia was no more frequent in patients
given  xxxd1747xxx  than in those given placebo.
two patients given  xxxd1747xxx  40 mg/d and 3 patients
given  xxxd1747xxx  80 mg/d experienced a rapidly increased
serum [na⫹]. no aes were considered potentially related to
the overly rapid increase in serum [na⫹]. no modifications to
the study treatment were necessary for 2 patients given
 xxxd1747xxx  40 mg/d who had a serum [na⫹] increase greater
than 12 meq/l in 24 hours. one patient given  xxxd1747xxx  80
mg/d experienced a serum [na⫹] increase greater than 24
meq/l during the 5-day treatment period. no modifications to
the study treatment were necessary for this patient. two patients given  xxxd1747xxx  80 mg/d reached a serum [na⫹] greater
than 145 meq/l between days 2 and 4. the study medication
dosage was reduced by 50% or withheld on days 3 through 5,
and the patients completed the study.
the thirst index in all treatment groups did not differ
significantly until day 5, when patients in both  xxxd1747xxx 
groups demonstrated a significantly higher index (p ⫽ 0.003).
none of the patients discontinued in response to increased
thirst. four patients given placebo and 1 patient given
 xxxd1747xxx  80 mg/d demonstrated a clinically significant increase in blood urea nitrogen level. the number of patients with
a clinically significant increase in serum creatinine was similar
among treatment groups. on day 2, the  xxxd3472xxx  concentration
was significantly higher in both  xxxd1747xxx  treatment groups
than in the placebo group (p ⬍ 0.0001). by study day 5,
however, the  xxxd3472xxx  concentration in both  xxxd1747xxx  treatment groups decreased to a level similar to that in the placebo
group. no treatment or dose effects were observed for the
laboratory values of clinical concern. no clinically significant
changes in vital signs, body weight, physical examination
findings, or electrocardiographic results were observed in the
 xxxd1747xxx  groups. compared with placebo, however,
 xxxd1747xxx  40 and 80 mg/d were associated with greater
mean ⫾ sd body weight reductions from baseline on days 1
(⫺0.2 ⫾ 1.18 kg, ⫺1.3 ⫾ 1.09 kg, and ⫺1.6 ⫾ 1.51 kg,
respectively) (p ⫽ 0.001) and 5 (⫺0.6 ⫾ 2.15 kg, ⫺1.2 ⫾ 1.69
kg, and ⫺1.5 ⫾ 3.07 kg).  xxxd1747xxx  did not have a significantly
greater effect on supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure than
did placebo (table 4).

discussion
oral administration of  xxxd1747xxx  produced clinically
relevant increases in serum [na⫹] and was effective in the
treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia.
 xxxd1747xxx  increased serum [na⫹] auc significantly more
than placebo, in accordance with the dosage given, during the
5-day treatment period.  xxxd1747xxx  produced a confirmed increase in serum [na⫹] of 4 meq/l or greater significantly faster
and for a significantly longer total time than placebo. in
addition, significantly more patients given  xxxd1747xxx  achieved
a confirmed increase in serum [na⫹] of 6 meq/l or greater or
a normal serum [na⫹]. the results of this study are consistent
with 2 other studies, one that assessed the efficacy and safety of
oral conivaptan28 and another that assessed the efficacy and
safety of  xxxd1747xxx  iv.29
 xxxd1747xxx  increases the excretion of solute-free water
by blocking renal v2 receptors, thus allowing serum [na⫹] to
increase. increases in fwc and ewc resulted in the excretion
of dilute urine, indicated by reductions in urine osmolality. the
increases in fwc and ewc peaked on day 1. subsequently,

⫺408 ⫾ 179 for  xxxd1747xxx  40 mg/d, and ⫺593 ⫾ 160 for  xxxd1747xxx  80 mg/d. baseline ewc (mean ⫾ se) value was 332 ⫾ 155

these increases were less pronounced. the increases in fwc
and ewc persisted throughout the study and were maintained
until the end of treatment. the selective increase in water
excretion leads to a reduction in body water and consequently
to increases in plasma osmolality and serum [na⫹].
the aquaretic effects of  xxxd1747xxx  are mediated primarily by the blocking of renal v2 receptors. the in vivo effects of
v1a antagonism are not well studied, but v1a blockade may
offer additional clinical benefits, especially in patients with
chf. excessive v1a signaling not only contributes to vasoconstriction but may also increase left ventricular afterload and
exacerbate preload.36,37 oral and iv  xxxd1747xxx  block the
pressor effects of avp at v1a receptors in rats and dogs, which
may produce vasodilation.23,38,39 hypotension is considered a
potential adverse effect of v1a blockade.37 the incidence of
hypotension, however, was no more frequent among those
given  xxxd1747xxx  than among those given placebo. in addition,
changes in blood pressure were small and may be attributable
to volume contraction as a result of aquaresis, not to v1a
antagonism. the results of this study reveal few, if any, clinical
effects of v1a antagonism in patients given  xxxd1747xxx .
fluid restriction is often recommended for patients with
mild, chronic hyponatremia. patients given  xxxd1747xxx  demon-

strated significantly greater increases in serum [na⫹] than those
given placebo, who were also prescribed fluid restriction. these
increases in serum [na⫹] were not influenced by fluid intake.
although none of the patients discontinued treatment
because of thirst, some patients given  xxxd1747xxx  reported greater
thirst, a finding consistent with the results of other studies of
v2-receptor antagonists and representative of an expected
physiologic response to an increase in plasma osmolality.20
this increase in thirst may also be related to the cause of
hyponatremia. in patients with the reset osmostat variant of
siadh, avp secretion and thirst are regulated at a plasma
osmolality setpoint lower than normal.40
in the treatment of hyponatremia, the risks associated
with low serum [na⫹] must be weighed against those associated with therapy. in symptomatic patients, the objective is to
correct serum [na⫹] at a rate and magnitude sufficient to
reverse symptoms, but not too rapidly as to potentially cause
osmotic demyelination.2,3,8,9,41 as shown in this study,
 xxxd1747xxx  increased serum [na⫹] promptly and safely at a rate
within recent recommendations in patients with euvolemic or
hypervolemic hyponatremia.42 the increase in serum [na⫹]
occurred more rapidly than desired in 5 patients, in whom the
withholding of the next dose and the resumption of treatment at
