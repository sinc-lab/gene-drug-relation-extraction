alpha 1-adrenergic inhibition of the beta-adrenergically activated cl- current in guinea pig ventricular myocytes.  alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation regulates the activity of a number of different cardiac ion channels, including those underlying one or more distinct cl- conductances. the whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used in the present study to investigate the effects of alpha-adrenergic stimulation on the beta-adrenergically regulated cl- current in guinea pig ventricular myocytes. neither alpha 1-adrenergic receptor stimulation with  xxxd2601xxx  (25 to 500 mumol/l) nor direct activation of endogenous protein kinase c (pkc) with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (pdbu, 100 nmol/l) evoked a cl- current. on the contrary, the cl- current activated by 30 nmol/l  xxxd2401xxx  was inhibited by  xxxd2601xxx , with an ec50 of 6.7 +/- 2.6 mumol/l, and this response was blocked by  xxxd3000xxx , an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist.  xxxd3000xxx  also decreased the ec50 for current activation by norepinephrine from 53 +/- 7.1 to 18 +/- 3.8 nmol/l, demonstrating that the ability of this endogenous neurotransmitter to activate the cl- current through beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation is limited by its intrinsic ability to also activate alpha-adrenergic receptors.  xxxd2601xxx  did not inhibit the cl- current evoked by either direct activation of adenylate cyclase with  xxxd1742xxx  or inhibition of phosphodiesterase activity with  xxxd2388xxx , indicating that alpha-adrenergic stimulation inhibits beta-adrenergic responses at a point upstream of adenylate cyclase activation.  xxxd2601xxx  also did not inhibit the cl- current activated by histamine, suggesting that alpha-adrenergic stimulation specifically inhibits beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated responses. the inhibitory effect of  xxxd2601xxx  was not mimicked by pdbu, and it persisted in the presence of  xxxd2195xxx , a selective pkc inhibitor. however,  xxxd2601xxx  inhibition of the  xxxd2401xxx -activated cl- current was sensitive to pertussis toxin. these results suggest that alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation inhibits the beta-adrenergically activated cl- current, demonstrating a novel mechanism by which alpha-adrenergic receptors may regulate ion channel activity in the heart.
