 xxxg1081xxx  antagonism diminishes
existing airway inflammation and dysfunction via
modulation of th2 cytokines
jeffery m cowden, jason p riley, jing ying ma, robin l thurmond, paul j dunford*

abstract
background: airway remodeling and dysfunction are characteristic features of asthma thought to be caused by
aberrant production of th2 cytokines.  xxxg1081xxx  ( xxxg1081xxx ) perturbation has previously been shown to
modify acute inflammation and th2 cytokine production in a murine model of asthma. we examined the ability of
 xxxg1081xxx  antagonists to therapeutically modify the effects of th2 cytokine production such as goblet cell hyperplasia
(gch), and collagen deposition in a sub-chronic model of asthma. in addition, effects on th2 mediated lung
dysfunction were also determined.
methods: mice were sensitized to ovalbumin (ova) followed by repeated airway challenge with ova. after
inflammation was established mice were dosed with the  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist, jnj 7777120, or anti-il-13 antibody for
comparison. airway hyperreactivity (ahr) was measured, lungs lavaged and tissues collected for analysis.
results: therapeutic  xxxg1081xxx  antagonism inhibited t cell infiltration in to the lung and decreased th2 cytokines il-13
and  xxxg1180xxx . il-13 dependent remodeling parameters such as gch and lung collagen were reduced. intervention with
 xxxg1081xxx  antagonist also improved measures of central and peripheral airway dysfunction.
conclusions: these data demonstrate that therapeutic  xxxg1081xxx  antagonism can significantly ameliorate allergen
induced, th2 cytokine driven pathologies such as lung remodeling and airway dysfunction. the ability of  xxxg1081xxx 
antagonists to affect these key manifestations of asthma suggests their potential as novel human therapeutics.

background
the pathology of chronic asthma is characterized by
inflammation and remodeling of airway tissues. as a
result of repeated inflammatory insults to the lung,
smooth muscle thickening, mucin secretion and airway
hyperreactivity may develop [1]. the current consensus
as to the etiology of allergic asthma defines it is an aberrant t-helper-2 (th2) type response to environmental
allergens characterized by overproduction of il-4,  xxxg1180xxx ,
and il-13 which are critical in maintaining an ongoing
ige-mediated, eosinophilic inflammation [2].
polarization of naïve th0 cells to the th2 and other t
helper sub-sets may be differentially controlled at the
level of the interaction between dendritic cells (dcs)
and antigen-specific t cells. such interaction can be

directed by a variety of cytokines, chemokines, tollligands and biogenic amines, such as histamine. these
are released at sites where antigen is encountered or
presented and may sequentially modulate the dendritic
cell and subsequent t helper phenotypes [3].
histamine has long been thought of as an important
mediator of asthma due to its ability to recapitulate
symptoms of asthma, such as bronchoconstriction, and
measured levels being correlated with asthma severity
[4,5]. however, the inefficacy of traditional antihistamines,  xxxg1078xxx  (h 1r) antagonists, has lead to the
belief that it is not a viable target for asthma therapy.
recently, a fourth receptor for histamine, the  xxxg1081xxx  ( xxxg1081xxx ) has been identified as a potential modulator of dendritic cell activation and t cell
polarization and to have a distinct pharmacological profile from h 1 r [6]. h 4 r is functionally expressed on
many cell types intimately associated with the pathology
of asthma, such as eosinophils, basophils, mast cells,

dendritic cells and cd8+ t cells, as recently reviewed
[7]. selective antagonism or gene knockout of  xxxg1081xxx  has
been demonstrated to diminish allergic lung inflammation in a mouse model, with specific reduction of th2type cytokines identified in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
(balf) and from draining lymph node cultures. notably, a profound reduction in th2 polarization and the
production of the effector th2 cytokine, il-13, was
observed [6].
il-13 is thought to be a critical mediator of allergic
asthma, with genetic and pharmacological evidence supporting its involvement in the development of airway
hyperreactivity (ahr) and the development of chronic
asthma and remodeling phenotypes [8,9]. as such,
numerous approaches to blocking increased il-13 in
asthma are being evaluated, with emphasis on il-13
neutralizing antibodies and soluble receptors, but the
identification of oral, small molecule inhibitors of il-13
would have obvious advantages. we therefore sought to
examine whether the previously reported modulation of
il-13, and other th2 cytokines, by h 4 r antagonists
could have a meaningful therapeutic effect on inflammation, remodeling and airway dysfunction in a subchronic model of allergic lung inflammation in the
mouse

il-13 mab (weekly i.v. 500 mug) or  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist jnj
7777120 (once daily, per os.) treatment was initiated on
day 36 once inflammation had already developed and
continued through day 58. agents were administered 1
h prior to each i.n. challenge. mice were sacrificed on
day 30 (to confirm existing inflammation) or day 59
with a terminal dose of 100 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital. serum was obtained from mice and lungs sampled
for inflammation parameters as described below.
bronchoalveolar lavage (bal)

following euthanasia bal samples were obtained, processed and inflammatory cells counted as previously
described [6]. supernatants were immediately frozen for
subsequent cytokine level analysis by elisa, as
described below.
t cell proliferation in draining lymph nodes

peribronchiolar lymph nodes (pbln) were collected and
pooled. a single cell suspension was prepared and cultured in 96 wells (0.4 million cells/per well) with or
without 100 mug of ova. after 96 h, 1°c of [3h] thymidine was added for 18 hours. cells were collected on a
filter and [3 h] incorporation quantified. supernatants
from non-thymidine treated, parallel 96 h cultures were
frozen for subsequent cytokine level analysis by elisa,
as described below.

mice

balb/c female mice (6-8 weeks old) were from charles
river laboratories. all mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and maintained on an
ova-free diet with free access to food and water. all
experimental animals used in this study were under a
protocol approved by the institutional animal care and
use committee of johnson & johnson pharmaceutical
research & development, l.l.c.
rat anti-mouse il-13, cnto 134, (igg2a isotype)
was kindly provided by dr wil glass (centcor inc, malvern, pa). jnj 7777120 was synthesized in the laboratories of johnson & johnson pharmaceutical research &
development, l.l.c., as previously described [10]. it is a
selective  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist with a ki at the mouse  xxxg1081xxx  of
5 nm [11]. compound was prepared in solution of 20%
hydroxypropyl- beta- cyclodextran (hpcd), w/v in h2o,
at various concentrations.
induction of sub-chronic airway inflammation

mice were immunized intra-peritoneally (i.p.) with 10 mug
ova (sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo) in pbs and inject
alum (pierce, rockford, il) mixed 1:1 on day 1 and
boosted in the same way on day 8. on day 22, 29, 36,
43, 50, and 57, mice received an intranasal (i.n.) challenge with 50 mul of pbs or 100 mug of ova in pbs
(2 mg/ml) under isoflourane anesthesia. anti-mouse

enzyme-llinked immunosorbent assays (elisas)

cytokines, il-4,  xxxg1180xxx  and il-13 levels were determined
in balf, homogenized lung preparations and in pbln
culture supernatants by elisa (r&d systems, minneapolis, mn). chemokines  xxxg361xxx ,  xxxg363xxx  and  xxxg354xxx  were
similarly measured in lung homogenates. all assays followed manufacturers’ directions.
protein concentration

tissue was homogenized in pbs using a fast-prep
homogenizer (thermo savant, holbrook, ny) and protein content assayed by bca assay (pierce, rockford, il)
as per the manufacturers’ instructions.
total collagen

free collagen was measured from the supernatants of
homogenized lung tissue in 1 ml pbs using the sircol,
dye-binding collagen assay kit (biocolor, belfast, uk)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
histology

following bal, lungs were fixed with 10% formalin
under constant pressure of 15-cm water. after fixation,
lungs were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin by
routine methods parahilar sagittal sections were
obtained. serial sections were stained with hematoxylin

and eosin (h&e) or periodic acid schiff (pas)/alcian
blue (counterstained with hematoxylin).
for cd3+ (ihc) staining, slides were deparaffinized
and hydrated in pbs followed by blocking the endogenous peroxide with 3%  xxxd2298xxx . to avoid nonspecific reaction with secondary antibody, slides were
pretreated with 10% normal donkey serum before incubation with cd3. the cd3+ primary antibody used in
this study was goat  xxxd2676xxx  (2 mug/ml) at a dilution of
1:100 (santa cruz biotechnology, inc. cat. no. sc-1127
and the secondary antibody used was donkey anti-goat
biotinlated igg (0.5 mug/ml) (chemicon international,
inc. cat. no. ap180b) at a dilution of 1:2000. normal
goat igg was used as negative controls. the immunoreactivities were visualized by abc reagents (vector, burlingame, cat. no. pk-6100) and diaminobezidine
(research genetic, cat. no. 750118) followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. cd3+ ihc was quantified
by counting five independent hot fields around the main
segmental bronchus.
for semiquantitative analysis of gch, sections were
analyzed morphometrically using simple pci image analysis software (compix inc, pa). pas-stained sections
were thresholded by color identification to measure only
the area of mucin content. mucin content was normalized to the diameter of each airway. at least three separate airways from each specimen were measured.
measurement of airway hyperreactivity

airway hyperreactivity was induced in mice using a previously described protocol [6]. animals received antimouse il-13 mab once one day prior to ovalbumin
challenge (i.v. 500 mug) or  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist jnj 7777120,
20 mg/kg (b.i.d. p.o.) prior to and 8 hours after each of
four daily challenges. twenty four hours after the fourth
ovalbumin challenge lung function measurements were
assessed using a computer controlled small animal ventilator (scireq, montreal, canada).
mice were anesthetized using intra-peritoneal injection
of 100 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital (euthasol,
anada#2). mechanical respiration on the flexivent was
immediately initiated using a tidal volume of 9 ml/kg at
a rate of 150 breaths/min, with a positive end-expiratory
pressure of 3 cm h2o. animals were allowed to acclimate to the respirator for approximately two minutes to
establish a stable baseline. at this time airway responses
were measured subsequent to aerosolized doses of
 xxxd2586xxx , 0 mg/ml, 25 mg/ml and 50 mg/ml, using
forced oscillation techniques. the resultant pressure and
flow data were fit into a constant phase model as previously described [12] and analyzed to compare drugtreated groups with vehicle-treated animals. the mean
of 12 sets of data after each aerosol challenge was analyzed for individual animals.

similar to other studies assessing forced oscillatory
mechanics we confined our analysis to: rn (newtonian
resistance), which assesses the flow resistance of the
conducting airways; g (tissue damping), which reflects
tissue resistance and h (tissue elastance), which reflects
the tissue rigidity [13].
statistical analysis

one-way analysis of variance, followed by dunnett’s
multiple comparison test, were performed where indicated. in all cases the p value was calculated based on
the difference between the vehicle treated controls and
respective treatment group in each study. a two-way
analysis of variance, with bonferroni post-test was performed for airway hyperreactivity measurements. the
error bars shown represent the sem. in all cases the
experiments were repeated two to three times with similar results and representative data are shown.

results
 xxxg1081xxx  antagonism therapeutically inhibits lung and bal
th2 cytokines

to examine the utility of h 4 r antagonists dosed in a
therapeutic regimen we utilized a sub-chronic model of
allergic airway inflammation, [14] and (fig 1a), in which
dosing of jnj 7777120 or anti-il-13 antibody were only
initiated after elicitation of inflammation through two
intranasal ovalbumin challenges in previously sensitized
animals. confirmation of inflammation by measurement
of airway inflammation and th2 cytokine induction was
confirmed prior to the commencement of treatment
(table 1).
after therapeutic treatment with the  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist,
significantly reduced levels of il-13 were detected compared to vehicle treatment in the balf (vehicle, 22.3 ±
2.2 pg/ml versus 5 mg/kg  xxxg1081xxx , 12.3 ± 2.1 pg/ml p < 0.01)
(fig 1b), and in the tissue (vehicle, 0.24 ± 0.03 pg/ml versus 5 mg/kg  xxxg1081xxx , 0.12 ± 0.01 pg/mug, p < 0.01) (fig 1c).
unfortunately, the nature of the anti-il-13 antibody
made it impossible to distinguish il-13 that has been
neutralized from active form using the elisa assay, so a
comparison of il-13 levels between vehicle and  xxxd2371xxx  treated groups was not possible. levels of  xxxg1180xxx 
were also significantly reduced in balf (vehicle, 23.2 ±
3.4 pg/mug tissue versus 5 mg/kg  xxxg1081xxx , 12.3 ± 1.3 pg/mug tissue p < 0.01) and in lung homogenate (vehicle, 0.17 ±
0.04 pg/mug versus 5 mg/kg  xxxg1081xxx , 0.05 ± 0.003 pg/mug, p <
0.01) after  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist treatment. anti-il-13 had no
effect on  xxxg1180xxx  levels in either media.

cell responses in the model was determined by

examining draining lymph node proliferation and cytokine production in response to antigen specific stimulation. t cells from both  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist (20 mg/kg) and
anti-il-13 treated groups (3035 ± 209 cpm and 3601 ±
117 cpm, p <0.01, respectively versus vehicle, 8316 ±
235 cpm) had decreased proliferation upon re-stimulation with antigen (fig 2a). in addition, levels of  xxxg1180xxx 
and il-13 in ova-stimulated culture supernatants were

significantly decreased by  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist and anti-il-13
treatment. (fig 2b). the levels of  xxxg1180xxx  from lymph
nodes of treated animals were below the level of quantification, which was 15 pg/ml. there was also trend
towards a reduction in il-4 levels. this last finding may
explain the observed significant reduction in serum ovaspecific ige after jnj 7777120 treatment (see figure s1,
additional file 1).

0.7 × 10 6 cell/ml p < 0.01), however treatment with
anti-il-13 antibody failed to statistically reduce eosinophil influx (fig. 3a). similar trends in the reduction of
inflammation were observed in histological sections of
the lung (fig 3b), and as measured by a blinded pathological score (data not shown). specific quantification of
cd3 + cell influx from immunohistochemical histology
(fig 4a) revealed a significant, 49% decrease in ova
challenged animals when dosed with h4 r antagonist
(vehicle, 71 ± 3 t cells/field versus  xxxg1081xxx , 36.2 ± 7.5 t
cells/field, p < 0.001) but not when dosed with antiil-13 (fig 4b). intranasal administration of pbs to ova
sensitized animals failed to cause leukocyte recruitment
to the lungs indicating the response to ovalbumin was
antigen specific.

(b) supernatants from parallel lymph node cultures treated with

control vehicle-treated animals is as follows: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
*** p < 0.001, psi < 15 pg/ml, the lower limit of quantification in this
assay.

 xxxg1081xxx  antagonism reduces lung tissue and lumenal
inflammation

leukocyte influx into the lung lumen was assessed by
lavage 24 hours after the sixth weekly challenge of
ova. eosinophilic inflammation routinely peaks at 48
hours after an allergen challenge in mice, yet we
sampled at 24 hours to allow for the concomitant
assessment of cytokines. accordingly, a somewhat
mixed eosinophil and neutrophil population was
observed at this time point (table 1 and fig 3a). treatment with the  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist at 20 mg/kg, initiated on
top of an existing inflammation, significantly reduced
the number of eosinophils in the lavage fluid by 61%

the mechanism by which  xxxg1081xxx  antagonism might reduce
t cell infiltration in to the lung was examined by the
measurement of chemokines in lung homogenates.
from a range of chemokines measured, corrected for
total protein levels, only  xxxg361xxx ,  xxxg363xxx  and  xxxg354xxx  were
modulated significantly by  xxxg1081xxx  antagonism or ani-il-13
treatment. the potent t cell chemoaatractants,  xxxg361xxx 
(fig 4c) and  xxxg363xxx  (fig 4d) were significantly and dose
dependently attenuated by h4 r antagonist treatment,
while  xxxg354xxx  ( xxxg354xxx ) was unchanged (fig 4e). conversely, anti-il-13 treatment significantly inhibited  xxxg354xxx 
production, with no effect on  xxxg361xxx  or  xxxg363xxx .
a comparable study, in which  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist, but not
anti-il-13 was examined revealed an additional dose
dependent and significant inhibition of  xxxg355xxx  (tarc)
production via  xxxg1081xxx  antagonism (see figure s2, additional file 2).
 xxxg1081xxx  antagonism suppresses goblet cell hyperplasia

in addition to investigating the anti-inflammatory effects
of  xxxg1081xxx  antagonism, it was important to assess whether
its modulation of th2 cytokines could have meaningful
effects on allergen induced airway structural changes.
consequently, an alcian blue/pas stain was used to
identify mucin in the airway epithelium of lung tissue
(fig 5a) and the mucin area per perimeter airway was
quantified as a measure of goblet cell hyperplasia
(gch), a major pathological feature of asthma gch
was significantly increased in ova challenged animals
versus saline controls (fig 5b). treatment with h 4 r
antagonist, 20 mg/kg, significantly reduced gch (vehicle 3.9 ± 0.35 versus  xxxg1081xxx , 1.9 ± 0.22 pix/perimeter airway, p < 0.01). in agreement with its central role in
goblet cell differentiation treatment with anti-il-13

discussion
h 4 r antagonists have previously been shown to have
anti-inflammatory activity when dosed prophylactically
in an acute, mouse model of allergic inflammation [6].
while that study demonstrated a reduction in th2 cytokine production, no changes in disease relevant th2 driven pathologies were reported. in the current study we
demonstrate the ability of an  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist to therapeutically modify existing allergic inflammation, and to
attenuate airway remodeling and hyperreactivity.
the model used herein, may be considered to be mast
cell independent, since sensitization protocols involving
co-administration of alum with antigen have been previously demonstrated as such [6,15]. consequently,
other cells are considered to be the source of histamine
acting at the h 4 receptor in this model, sufficient to
drive th2 mediated responses. cells including basophils,
dendritic cells and neutrophil have been shown to
release histamine [6,16,17], with low levels sufficient to

activate the high affinity h 4 r, and h 4 r antagonists
effective in mast cell deficient animals [6]. interestingly,
serotonin has also been shown to contribute to airway
inflammation in mast-cell independent models [18] and
has traditionally been viewed as the primary biogenic
amine in rodents. a contribution of histamine and  xxxg1081xxx 
is now demonstrated and suggests the proposed dominance of serotonin in mice to be predicated on the previous lack of effects of  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists in such models
which do not block  xxxg1081xxx  responses [7].
we firstly demonstrated that the selective  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist, jnj 7777120, was able to therapeutically reduce
th2 cytokine levels in diseased lung tissue and in
response to antigen-specific re-stimulation of t cells.
furthermore, a physiologically significant role for that
reduction was confirmed by the marked attenuation of
il-13 driven pathologies. goblet cell hyperplasia and
collagen deposition, classical markers of il-13 mediated
remodeling in murine models of asthma, [14,19] were
strongly induced by sub-chronic allergic airway inflammation and were fully attenuated by anti-il-13 antibody
treatment. these effects were recapitulated by h 4 r
antagonist treatment and in support of a direct relationship of these remodeling parameters to il-13 levels, the
extent of their amelioration by jnj 7777120 was proportional to its reduction of il-13 levels in the tissue.

7777120 (20 mg/kg b.i.d) and anti-il-13 around an acute(4 ×) ovalbumin challenge were anesthetized 24 h after the last challenge and lung
function measured via a small animal ventilator by forced oscillation techniques.  xxxd2586xxx  dose response relationships were obtained for (a)
central airway resistance, (b) tissue stiffness and (c) tissue damping. each plotted value reflects the mean values for each group of mice (n = 610/group). each animal’s value reflects the mean of 12 sets of data captured over a 3-minute span after each aerosol challenge was analyzed for
individual animals. significance of each treatment group compared to control vehicle-treated animals is as follows: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p
< 0.001

the  xxxg1081xxx  and il-13 also both appear to mediate allergic airway dysfunction. development of airway hyperreactivity and hyperresponsiveness to innocuous stimuli
is a diagnostic and pathological feature of asthma that
can be recapitulated in animal models of allergic airway
inflammation, and has been linked to increased airway
il-13 [20]. in our hands the model of sub-chronic airway inflammation that we utilized did not result in a
reproducible increase in airway hyperreactivity, as
reported by others [14]. in contrast to these studies,
which used the dimensionless measure of penh to measure ahr, and which in fact may be measuring other
irrelevant respiratory changes [21], we used more reliable forced oscillation techniques to assess airway function. the absence of airway hyperreactivity observed in
our model might result from an excessive remodeling

and stiffening of the airways, thereby diminishing its
contractile potential. alternatively other workers have
reported a ‘burning out’ of ahr in such chronic models
[22,23]. consequently, we utilized another welldescribed model to initiate airway hyperreactivity and to
examine the effect of  xxxg1081xxx  antagonists and anti-il-13 on
this parameter.
using this model, a robust hyperreactivity was demonstrated in vehicle treated mice as indicated by an
increase in central and peripheral airways resistance. a
corresponding increase in peripheral lung stiffness (elastance) was also measured in vehicle treated animals.
all of these parameters were blocked both by h 4 r
antagonism and anti-il-13 treatment. previous research
has highlighted the importance of il-13 in controlling
airway hyperresponsiveness in mice [8,20]. several

cowden et al. respiratory research 2010, 11:86
http://respiratory-research.com/content/11/1/86

studies have indicated that this is a direct effect on resident airway structural cells, and not a secondary effect
due to recruitment of inflammatory cells [8,20]. consequently, we reproduced results that supported this
observation since anti-il-13 treatment resulted in a
complete abolishment of airway hyperreactivity, with no
effect on airway inflammation.
whilst these effects on goblet cell hyperplasia, collagen deposition and airway hyperreactivity supported
the premise that  xxxg1081xxx  may modulate chronic remodeling
through modulation of il-13 production, other antiinflammatory effects of h4 r antagonism appear to be
independent of the reduction in il-13, since they were
not recapitulated by anti-il-13 treatment. notably,
whilst  xxxg1081xxx  antagonists were able to inhibit eosinophil
and t cell influx into the airways, anti-il-13 treatment
did not cause a significant attenuation of these cell
types. the effect on eosinophilic inflammation may in
part be due to the fact that  xxxg1180xxx  in the airways, as measured in balf and in lung homogenate, was reduced in
h 4 r antagonist treated animals, whereas anti-il-13
treatment had little effect. conversely, anti-il-13 did
reduce  xxxg354xxx  ( xxxg354xxx ) levels, whereas  xxxg1081xxx  treatment
did not, perhaps suggesting a redundant role for  xxxg354xxx 
in this particular model.
the lower levels of  xxxg1180xxx  and il-13 observed in the
lung are likely a result of decreased recruitment of t
cells since cd3+ t cells were seen to be reduced in the
lung after  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist treatment, but not by  xxxd2371xxx  treatment. the effect on t cell influx in to the lung
may relate to the observed reduction in  xxxg361xxx  and
 xxxg363xxx  in lung tissue which may act at both ccr1 and
ccr5 to modulate t cell recruitment in to the allergic
lung [24,25]. reduction of the ccr4 ligand,  xxxg355xxx  by
 xxxg1081xxx  antagonist in a comparable study (additional data)
also suggests a direct inhibition of ccr4 + th2 cells, a
sub-population implicated in asthma pathogenesis [26].
ccr1 positive t cells have been shown to be associated
with il-13 release [24] and th2 cells are known to be
the main source of  xxxg1180xxx  in allergic airway inflammation
[27]. of additional interest,  xxxg1081xxx  has been implicated in
direct recruitment of t cell subsets to the lung [28] and
in the release of other t cell chemoattractants such as
il-16 [29].
 xxxg1180xxx  and il-13 levels in the tissue may also be reduced
by a direct effect on th2 cell cytokine elaboration. indeed
antigen restimulation of lymphocytes from  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist treated animals led to lower levels of both cytokines.
this is likely related to the previously reported modulation of th2 polarization by  xxxg1081xxx  antagonists [6]. in this
previous study decreases in il-4,  xxxg1180xxx  and il-13 were
also demonstrated in ovalbumin stimulated lymph node
cultures from h 4 r antagonist treated or h 4r deficient
mice, despite any effect on proliferation. this effect on

page 10 of 12

th2 cytokines, via a modulation of th2 activation, may
result from a role of  xxxg1081xxx  in the th2 priming capability of
dendritic cells [6]. the exact mechanism for this is as yet
unknown, but reduced levels of pro-th2 cytokines such
as il-4 and il-6 may explain the reduction in downstream th2 polarization. indeed, a functionally relevant
reduction in il-4 was suggested by an observed decrease
in antigen-specific ige observed with h 4 r antagonist
treatment.
in contrast to findings in the acute model of asthma
[6], in the sub-chronic model reported herein, antigen
specific lymph node proliferation was attenuated after
therapeutic treatment with jnj 7777120. this may result
from the continued activation of memory t cells in the
more chronic setting, and its progressive attenuation
under h4 r blockade. one explanation of this may be
the reduction in il-4 production following restimulation
seen here and in the previous model [6]. reduction in
il-4 levels would likely suggest that subsequent th0 to
th2 polarization of new effectors cells with each antigen
challenge would be disrupted. in addition, other workers
have described an  xxxg1081xxx  dependent reduction in th1 promoting cytokine il-12 production from human dendritic
cells that may contribute to this effect [30]. therefore, a
possible reduction in antigen-specific th2 cells might
therefore be possible with chronic dosing of an h 4 r
antagonist in a disease setting where individuals are
continually exposed to allergen.
the inefficacy of anti-il-13 on lung inflammation and
tissue  xxxg1180xxx  levels reported here is in contrast to other
reports in similar models where  xxxg1180xxx  was reduced in
balf by an il-13 vaccine approach [19] or in lung
homogenates, with an anti-il-13 antibody [14]. nevertheless our data is consistent with previous reports
showing that over expression of il-13 did not alter  xxxg1180xxx 
expression in mouse lung [9], nor was it affected by il13 genetic deficiency in a mouse asthma model [20].
to put our findings into a clinical context, whilst the
targeting of single cytokines, such as il-4 [31,32] or  xxxg1180xxx  [33-35], has repeatedly failed to show meaningful clinical benefit in broad asthma populations a recent report
has highlighted the efficacy of an inhaled, dual il-4/il13 receptor blocker [36]. consequently, a broader
approach to inhibiting th2 cytokine production, as possible with h 4 r antagonists and other small molecule
inhibitors of th2 cell polarization, may prove beneficial.
provocatively, suplatast tosilate, a small molecule modulator of dendritic cell function and of th2 cytokine production, working through an, as yet, unknown
mechanism, has demonstrated efficacy in asthmatic individuals, [37,38] with reported diminishment of il-4 and
il-13 producing cells and concomitant goblet cell
hyperplasia [39].  xxxg1081xxx  antagonists share these properties,
at least in mouse models examined so far.

conclusions
therapeutic treatment with an  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist can inhibit th2 driven pathologies such as lung remodeling in a
model of sub-chronic asthma and, in addition, can
improve airway dysfunction. these observations, in conjunction with the previously reported direct effects of
 xxxg1081xxx  perturbation on mast cell and eosinophil function
again reiterate the potential importance of histamine in
asthma and suggest the utility of h 4 r antagonists as
novel therapeutics in allergic respiratory disease.
