summary. in this study we investigated the affinity of severa! 4-chlorinated and 1-ene derivatives of  xxxd2618xxx  (mt) and 17x-methyl-5-dihydrotestosterone (mdht) to the
 xxxg183xxx , and, additionally, the effect of a few mt-derived steroids on the activity of the
ôoc-reductase enzyme present in the rat seminal vesicle. from our results we conclude, that 1. 41
or/and 44 double bonds in ring a counteract the inhibition of receptor-binding caused by chlorinesubstitution at 04; 2. the dissociation of myotropic and androgenic effects [=mfa dissociation] of
4-chloro-mt (as compared to mt) is due to its inactivation by 5oc-reductase in androgen target organs
and/or to the inhibition of the conversion of endogenous testosterone to dht; 3. the m/a dissociation of 1-ene-mt and 4-chloro-1-ene-mt may be explained by their inability to be activated by 5xreductase; 4. for the same reason, m/a dissociation can be assigned to the effects of 4-chloro-1-ene.

we determined the short-term and long-term competition of  xxxd1786xxx  and chlormadinone acetate with [311]dht for receptor binding at 000 and showed, that the complexes formed by

these antiandrogens with the  xxxg183xxx  have equally reduced stabilities compared to the
dijt-receptor complex.

introduction
receptor-binding properties and metabolism in target tissues are major factors influencing profoundly the range and extent of biological effects of anabolic-androgenic
steroids. it can be attributed to this fact, that for a long time the interest of a number
of investigators is directed to the study of the steroid-binding properties and ligandspecificity of androgen receptors and to the metabolism of steroids in androgen sensitive

tissues. among the main objectives of these studies is to determine, or even to map,
the effects of various modifications of steroid molecules on their receptor-binding characteristics and androgen-anabolic effects, in order to make possible the prediction of bio-

logical properties of new synthetic steroids. during this work, numerous structural
features of the steroid molecules were characterized with respect to significance in receptor-binding and biological effects. for example the 17ß-oh and 3-oxo functions
(grover and odell, 1975; sham and boesel, 1976; zakár and tóth, 1982), the 19-methyl
group (liao et al., 1973; tóth and zakár, 1982 a, b), the number and positions of double

bonds in the steroid structure (raynaud et al., 1979; delettré et al., 1980) and the
available, however, about the  xxxg183xxx -binding properties of an important
group of synthetic steroids possessing chlorine-substitution at c4. since several strong
anabolic and androgenic agents can be found among them (potts et al., 1976), we have
investigated the binding of a few representatives of these steroids together with their
unsubstituted parent compounds to the rat seminal vesicle  xxxg183xxx . moreover,
we have studied the effect of 4-chlorinated steroids on the 50-reductive metabolism of
19-nortestosterone in the seminal vesicles in vitro. our purpose was to assess the influence of 4-chioro-substitution on receptor-binding and target-cell metabolism, thus
providing some insight into the biochemical mechanisms underlying the in vivo actions
of these compounds. additionally, the receptor-binding of two 6-chlorinated steroids

-  xxxd1786xxx  and chlormadinone acetate - has also been studied in order to
promote a more complete understanding of the interactions of these antiandrogens
with the  xxxg183xxx .

fig. 1 shows the effect of several 4-chioro- and 1-ene-derivatives of  xxxd2618xxx  (mt) and 17-methyl-5x-dihydrotestosterone (mdht) on the binding of
[3h]dht to the seminal vesicle  xxxg183xxx . in this representative experiment,
reaction mixtures were incubated for 22 hours at 15°c. these conditions are obviously
more favourable for the attainment of binding equilibrium than incubation at 0°c, at
which temperature equilibrium is often not reached even after 72 hours (zakár and
tóth, 1980). of the steroids tested, mdht was the most effective competitor (fig. 1 c).

introduction of the 44 double bound resulted in a slight but significant decrease of
competition potency (see mt, fig. 1 c), and the additional presence of the 41 double
bond led to a rather marked further decrease in the affinity of the steroid to the receptor
(see emt on fig. lb).

chlorine-substitution at c4 modified the competition behavior of the above steroids
to an extent which was highly dependent on the number of double bonds in ring a.
thus, in the case of 1-ene-17-methyl-testosterone (emt), having two double bonds in
ring a, 4-chloro-substitution did not cause any apparent change of competition efficiency (see cemt, fig. 1 b). 4-chioro-substitution of mt, however, decreased slightly
the affinity of the steroid to the receptor (see cmt, fig. 1 c), and the 4-chioro-derivative
of mdht, which has no double bond in ring a, exhibited a markedly decreased competition capacity when compared to its parent compound (see mdhit and cmdht on figs.
1c and la, respectively). moreover, the very similar behavior of cmt and cemdht
(4o-chloro-1-ene-mdht) in this competition system (fig. 1 a) indicates, that there is
no major difference between the zi 1 and 44 double bonds with respect to their effects
on the  xxxg183xxx -binding properties of 4-chlorinated steroids.

fig. 2 shows that mt, a substrate for 5oc-reductase, effectively inhibits the metabolism of [311]nt to labelled öoc-dihydro-nt (dhn). cmt, if added in the same molar
excess (50 and 500-fold) as mt, had a similar inhibitory effect on the 5 oc-reduction of
[3h]nt. this suggests, that cmt is a substrate or an inhibitor of 5x-reductase. emt
inhibited the formation of dhn much less effectively than mt and cmt (fig. 2). cemt
had a somewhat higher affinity to the enzyme than emt, but its efficacy as inhibitor
was far from that of either mt or cmt. these results indicate, that 5ix-reduction of the
41-unsaturated steroids is probably less significant in vivo than the reduction of testosterone, mt or possibly cmt.

to [311]dht (zakár and tóth, 1982). again, no significant difference was found between

the behavior of emt and cemt (panels a and b on fig. 3), indicating their similar,
if not identical receptor-binding properties.
perhaps one of the most important of these properties is the decreased stability of
the emt- and cemt-receptor complexes, compared to the stability of the dhtreceptor complex. this is reflected by the reduction of competition efficiency of emt
and cemt during the long-term incubations (fig. 3a and fig. 3b). the competition
curves of cmt, on the other hand, show practically no divergence under these conditions,

which means that the latter steroid dissociates from the receptor as a rate which is

discussion

our findings on the effects of 41 and 44 double bonds on the binding of androstane
derivatives to the vesicular  xxxg183xxx  are in accord with the results of others
(skinner et al., 1975; kirchhoff et al., 1979; raynaud et al., 1979) working with the
 xxxg183xxx  of the rat ventral prostate. thus, kirchhoff et al. (1979), who determined the equilibrium dissociation constants of a number of steroids having 18 or 19
c-atoms, also found the following order of affinity: mdht> mt> emt. moreover,
these investigators showed that 17-methyl-1-ene-dht (emdht) binds to the androgen
receptor'with practically the same affinity as mdht, which indicates that thezl 1 double
bond alone does not decrease the affinity of mdht to the receptor binding site.

quite close to the rate of dissociation of dht. in this regard, cmt shows a close resemblance to mt, the behavior of which has already been characterized in this system (zakár
and tóth, 1982).

t. zaae et al.,  xxxg183xxx  binding of chloro-steroids

139

introduction of a chlorine at c4 changed characteristically the receptor-binding
properties of the above steroids. specifically, the more saturated the parent compound
was in ring a, the greater reduction of receptor-binding affinity occurred due to substitution. so, cmdht had a much lower competition potency than mdht; cmt and
cemdht competed with a moderately reduced efficiency compared to mt and (preshowed apparently identical competition behavior even when tested under two different
sets of conditions. these observations suggest, that the 4-chloro-substituent and the
zi 1 plus a 4 double bonds influence closely related elements of the steroid-androgen
receptor interaction.
emt and cemt are being used under various names as anabolic drugs (eg. nerobol
and oral turinabol, respectively). the myotropic/androgenic dissociation in the effects
of these steroids is, most probably, due to their low affinity to the 5x-reductase enzyme,
which is responsible for the production of dht, the active metabolite of testosterone
in the accessory sexual glands. cemt has been reportedto have a wider myotropic/
androgenic dissociation than emt (dörner, 1964) that may be explained by its higher
affinity to the enzyme (fig. 2), and, additionally, by assuming that these compounds
are rather inhibitors than substrates for the 5x-reductase.
cmt exhibits a pronounced dissociation of myotropic and androgenic effects (2.78.5, relative to mt) (potts et al., 1976). this dissociation may seem surprising, since mt

and cmt have almost the same affinity to both the  xxxg183xxx  and the 5reductase enzyme (figs. 1 and 2, respectively). the products of the 5x-reductive
metabolism of the two steroids, however, have very different receptor-binding affinities:
mdht binds strongly to the receptor, while cmdht has a much reduced affinity, as
it is shown on fig. 1. accordingly, cmt, if acted upon by a-reduetase, rs converted

to cmdht in the accessory sexual glands, and this leads to myotropic/androgenic
dissociation due to the reduced androgenicity of the metabolite formed. the inhibition
of 5x-reduction of endogenous testosterone, which is to occur almost certainly after the
administration of cmt, should still add to the selective anabolic potency of this steroid.
cemdht, which binds to the  xxxg183xxx  with n affinity comparable to that
of cmt, is obviously not a substrate for 5x-reductase. it may be expected, consequently,
that this compound will show myotropic/androgenic dissociation in vivo. moreover,
cemdht may prove to be effective in lower doses than emt or cemt, because it
binds to the receptor with higher affinity.

finally, our results demonstrate the resemblance of  xxxg183xxx -binding
properties of  xxxd1786xxx  and chlormadinone acetate from a further point of
view: apart from having practically the same equilibrium dissociation constant at 0°c
(kirchhoff et al., 1979) and competition potency in short (120 min.) incubations (raynaud et al., 1980), both steroids show a loss of efficiency as competitor when receptor
binding of [3h]dht is measured in their presence after long (67 hrs) incubations.. this
would mean that  xxxd1786xxx  and chlormadinone acetate dissociate from the
receptor at a higher rate than dht, which may somehow be related to their antiandrogenie effects (raynaud et al., 1980).
