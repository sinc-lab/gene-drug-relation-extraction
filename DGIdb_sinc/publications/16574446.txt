abstract
this study analyzes 16 molecular dynamic simulations of a biophysical model for b2-adrenergic ( xxxg92xxx ) and g protein-coupled receptor
(gpcr) activation. in this model, a highly conserved cysteine residue, c106 (c3.25 or cysiii:01), provides a free sulfhydryl or thiol group in an
acid–base equilibrium between uncharged (rsh) and charged (rs) states that functions as an electrostatic molecular switch for receptor
activation. the transition of c106 in the  xxxg92xxx  between acid and base states significantly changes the helical/transmembrane (tm) domain
interactions and the electrostatic interaction energy differences (ddeel). the ddeel changes correlate well with the experimentally observed
ligand efficacies. the tm interaction energies display patterns compatible with those previously recognized as responsible for gpcr activation.
key differences between the agonist, epinephrine, and the antagonist,  xxxd2957xxx , are seen for the  xxxg2318xxx   6,  xxxg2318xxx   4, tm6  7 and tm1  7
interaction energies.  xxxd2957xxx  also produces a weaker ddeel interaction and less tm interaction energy changes, which are important differences
between the agonist and antagonist ligands. the d115e mutant with  xxxd2957xxx  displays a greater ddeel and tm interactions than for the wild-type
 xxxg92xxx  with  xxxd2957xxx . this explains the higher activity of  xxxd2957xxx  in the d115e mutant. the constitutively active d130a mutant displays tm
interaction patterns similar to those for the activating ligands implying a common pattern for receptor activation. these findings support the broad
concept of protean agonism and demonstrate the potential for allosteric modulation. they also demonstrate that this two-state model agrees with
many previous experimental and theoretical observations of gpcrs.

receptor activation requires the recognition of an extracellular signal that usually involves an endogenous agonist
ligand activating its target receptor. the g protein-coupled
receptors (gpcrs), receive and transmit these signals to the
intracellular environment. as general models for all gpcrs,
the b2-adrenergic ( xxxg92xxx ) and rhodopsin receptors have been
studied extensively to understand the complex molecular
changes that accompany receptor activation and signal
transduction.
recent experimental discoveries have significantly changed
our understanding of how these receptors work. bond et al.
demonstrated that transgenic mice with an increased number of

l.a. rubenstein et al. / journal of molecular graphics and modelling 25 (2006) 396–409

 xxxg92xxx  receptors exhibit spontaneous activity similar to
normally expressed receptors in the presence of an agonist
ligand [1]. this observation separated receptor activation from
the action of agonist ligands alone and prompted a revision of
receptor models to include an intrinsically active receptor state.
one consequence of this revision was that the resting
populations of receptors must interconvert by themselves from
resting to active states. however, the biophysical basis for these
active and inactive receptor states has not been adequately
defined or understood. one possible perspective is that there
must exist an equilibrium between the inactive and active
receptor states that can be perturbed to produce a shift in the net
amounts of these states. an agonist ligand favoring the active
receptor state would perturb the initial chemical equilibrium
thereby inducing receptor activation in a manner similar to le
chatelier’s principle. however, the underlying molecular
mechanism of this perturbation needs to be more carefully
examined.
mathematical models are essential for understanding the
underlying biophysical events that determine the receptor
response. in general, two-state mathematical models have been
among the most successful for describing receptor activation
[2–8]. most of these models calculate either the proportional or
fractional receptor occupancy as the overall receptor response
[2–5]. although it is seductive to assume that the proportional
amount of an active receptor state should correlate with the
biological response, the experimental evidence for receptor
overexpression and spare receptors suggests that the calculation
of the net change in the active receptor state is a much better
measure for response than is the fractional or proportional
change [6–8]. this is demonstrated by the effects of agonist/
antagonist combinations on the desensitization of b-receptors
[7,8]. this is also demonstrated by receptors that are activated
by overexpression since this requires a change between r and
r* that is difficult to understand in terms of a proportional
rather than a net change [7,8]. from this perspective, it is
important to determine within the constructs of any molecular
model what molecular states interconvert either by ligands,
receptor overexpression or mutation.
several experimental techniques show that the relative
movements of transmembrane domains iii and vi ( xxxg2318xxx  and
tm6) correspond with receptor activation in both the rhodopsin
and  xxxg92xxx  receptors [9–15]. gether et al., using fluorescent
labels, localized agonist-induced conformational changes of
the  xxxg92xxx  to  xxxg2318xxx  and tm6 [12]. ballesteros et al. showed that
charge-neutralizing mutations of e268 in tm6 and  xxxd130xxx  in
 xxxg2318xxx  led to a significant increase in basal and pindololstimulated camp accumulation in cos-7 cells, which was
presumably due to an increase in the relative motions of  xxxg2318xxx  to
tm6 [13,14]. in the rhodopsin receptor, khorana’s group using
spin labels attached to cysteine residues showed that rigid body
movements of  xxxg2318xxx  relative to tm6 were essential for
activation [10].
other investigators have also suggested that the cis–trans
isomerization of retinal in rhodopsin causes repositioning
followed by a movement of  xxxg2318xxx  away from tm6 [9,11,15].
clearly there are many studies that implicate  xxxg2318xxx  and tm6

397

with the molecular events leading to receptor activation. an
implicit assumption from these important studies is that there
exists an ‘‘off’’ conformation of the  xxxg2318xxx  and tm6 domains
that can be switched to an ‘‘on’’ conformation corresponding
with gpcr activation. however, from this perspective, it is
difficult to clearly translate  xxxg2318xxx  and tm6 domain motions into
discrete molecular entities for specific on and off states.
previously, we have attempted to bridge this gap by defining
specific receptor states that relate the acid–base transition of a
conserved sulfhydryl group to the mathematically defined r
and r* states [16]. in this present work, we examine whether or
not this model can be applied to the molecular dynamic analysis
of the  xxxg92xxx .
although controversial, there is a wealth of experimental
evidence for the existence of at least one free sulfhydryl group
that modulates the receptor response in many gpcrs [16–34].
for decades it has been known that there are free sulfhydryl
groups in blood and on the external side of animal tissues in
vivo [17]. however, most experimentalists and theoreticians
have not seriously questioned that the conserved disulfidebonded cysteines may be a potential source of free sulfhydryl
groups under normal physiologic conditions. this may be
primarily due to the fact that all of the gpcr families are
considered to have a highly conserved disulfide bond
connecting a conserved cysteine in the extracellular region
of  xxxg2318xxx  [19–21]. within all of the gpcr families this disulfidelinked cysteine, c110 in rhodopsin or c106 in the  xxxg92xxx , is the
most conserved cysteine that is vital for gpcr expression and
function [19–21]. this disulfide’s proximity to both the
extracellular region and the ligand binding region suggests
that the oxidation/reduction state of this bond could modulate
both ligand binding and receptor function [23–25].
from specific sequence analyses, it is known that the  xxxg92xxx 
receptor contains a total of 13 cysteine residues [18]. of these
cysteines, there are four potentially reactive cysteines, c106,
c184, c190 and c191, on the external side of the  xxxg92xxx  that
may form at least one extracellular disulfide bond [18].
similarly, in the rhodopsin receptor there are three external
cysteines, c110, c185 and c187 that are potentially reactive.
the odd number of external cysteines in the rhodopsin receptor
insures that there will be at least one free sulfhydryl group even
when the disulfide bond is formed.
the crystal structure for rhodopsin in the protein data bank
(1f88) shows c110 in the extracellular region of  xxxg2318xxx 
positioned about 10 å away from the 11-cis-retinal chromophore and 7 å from glutamine e113 [15,22]. this c110 is
normally considered to be in a disulfide bond with c187 and is
apparently in a disulfide bond in the crystal structure; however,
the nearby c185 apparently exists as a free sulfhydryl group,
which may undergo acid–base transitions as well as other
chemical reactions. because the conditions for crystallization
are very different from the natural state in which receptors
normally function in vivo, it is difficult to imagine that the
conditions for crystallization would preserve the free sulfhydryl
groups of a reduced disulfide bond. receptors transiently
exposed to oxidizing conditions in vivo or in vitro may form this
disulfide bond as a protective mechanism so that upon return to

398

reducing conditions, the normal receptor state could be easily
regenerated.
in this context, it is important to consider a few of the
complex chemical equilibria between the acid/base and
oxidized/reduced forms of cysteine [35]. first, the side chain
can reversibly ionize:
rsh $ rs þ hþ

(1)

second, there is the oxidation/reduction equilibrium involving
the disulfide bond:
rsh þ rs $ rssr þ oh

(2)

in the presence of a suitable oxidizing agent, a suitable base
acts to increase the probability of disulfide bond formation by
forming rs, which initiates the reaction cascade for disulfide
bond formation (shown below) [36].
in general, many sulfhydryl groups or mercaptans are easily
oxidized to disulfides and the interconversion between cysteine
and cystine is important in biochemistry [36]. this mechanism
has been studied for several oxidizing agents and varies with the
agent. for oxygen it is:
rsh þ b $ rs þ bh


rs þ o2 $ rs þ o2
rs þ o2







$ rs þo2 2



2rs $ rssr
o2 2 þ bh $ oh þ b þ o2
this mechanism with respect to the sulfur involves the loss
of a proton, reduction to a free radical followed by radical
coupling [36]. the resultant equation from this reaction cascade
is eq. (2) above. this reaction cascade demonstrates the
important role played by base ions (b) to favor free radical
formation in the presence of an oxidizing agent such as
molecular oxygen. this also demonstrates some of the
experimental difficulties in studying free thiol groups since
exposure to air in the presence of a base is often sufficient to
oxidize free thiols to disulfides or several other oxidized species
too numerous to mention here [35–39].
from the above considerations, assumptions that the disulfide
cysteines are always resistant to chemical derivatization may not
be correct for the normal conditions of receptor function in vivo.
when one or more of the extracellular cysteines of the  xxxg92xxx 
(c106, c184, c190 or c191) are either mutated or chemically
altered thiol/disulfide exchange may occur with the remaining
free cysteines or other free thiol groups to complicate the
analysis. in addition, double mutants often fail to express either
as an extracellular or functional form of the receptor, which
makes it difficult to determine which of the four cysteines in the
 xxxg92xxx  are most critical for receptor function and expression
[18,19]. this is usually interpreted as evidence for the disulfide
bond being essential for receptor activation [18,19]. although
this view has been accepted without very much critical
questioning, there is at least one alternative explanation [16].

evidence from experimental binding studies from several
gpcrs demonstrate that a free sulfhydryl group is next to the
agonist ligand binding site [26–33]. sidhu made use of this fact
to purify the d-1 dopamine receptor from rat striatum [26].
others using a morphine ligand with an attached sulfhydryl
group found a free sulfhydryl group near the ligand binding site
of the m opioid receptor [27].
additional studies have found free sulfhydryl groups next to
the agonist binding site in the m, d and k opioid receptors
[28,29]. heinonen et al., using a series of sh-reactive
‘‘molecular yardsticks’’, found a cysteine thiol group about
8.6–14.5 å from the position of asp113 ( xxxd113xxx ) in the a2adrenergic receptor [30]. since this aspartate residue is
important for attracting the positive amine group of binding
ligands in many gpcrs including the  xxxg92xxx , the proximity of
free cysteines may be considered as a critical component of
normal receptor function, which has been experimentally
observed [23,24,31–34] and theoretically justified [16].
experimental measurements of receptor activation suggest
that the disulfide bond requires reduction to a free sulfhydryl for
the functional state of several gpcrs in vivo [23–25,34]. one
of the simplest and most direct experimental studies demonstrated that externally applied sulfhydryl reducing agents
potentiate the response of tissues to various agonist ligands
[34]. this study found that the reduction of disulfide bonds to
free sulfhydryls increased the tissue responsiveness for many
receptors and increased the potency of many agonists [34]. one
problem with these studies is that physiologically opposing
receptors may be simultaneously stimulated by the application
of thiol reducing agents, which would confuse the analysis of
the tissue response.
additional evidence for the requirement of reduction for
normal receptor function is evident in a number of other
important studies. a free sulfhydryl group in the active
rhodopsin receptor state is suggested from the mi to mii
equilibrium shift of 4 units from a pk of 4.1 for ligand-free
opsin to 8.5 [3]. this is also supported by the findings of
saranak and foster that implicate a free sulfhydryl in the
reductive activation of the rhodopsin photoreceptor [23]. for
the muscarinic receptors, florio and sternweis found that the
reducing agent dtt produced functional activation and
potentiated agonist activation [25]. pedersen and ross using
purified b-adrenergic receptors and purified gs protein in
phospholipid vesicles found that the treatment of these
receptors with the sulfhydryl reducing agent dithiolthreitol
(dtt) activated the g protein in either the presence or absence
of agonist [24]. since there was no effect of dtt on gs alone,
they reasoned that it was the receptor itself that was the target of
the reducing agent and not the g protein [24]. several other
studies have also shown that constitutive activation occurred in
reconstituted systems containing both b-adrenergic receptors
and g proteins when the membrane vesicles were prepared with
sulfhydryl reducing agents [31–33]. these experimental
findings need to be included into a comprehensive model for
receptor activation.
previously, the acid and base states of the sulfhydryl group
within the c148 residue in the  xxxg1113xxx  were linked to

399

the inactive and active receptor states r and r* [16]. in the
current study, we have extended this model to the  xxxg92xxx  where
the corresponding cysteine residue is c106 (c3.25 or
cysiii:01). this cysteine, located on the extracellular side of
 xxxg2318xxx , functions as a molecular switch that toggles between the
charged (rs) and uncharged (rsh) states associated with the
acid to base transition of the sulfhydryl group [16]. this
provides a specific molecular switch for receptor activation that
correlates well with both the ligand induced electrostatic
interaction energy difference (ddeel) and the experimentally
measured ligand efficacies and the preferential attraction of
ligands for the base receptor state (rs) [16]. in this context,
ligand-induced perturbations produce a net change in the
amount of the base receptor state (rs), that can mathematically describe the receptor response in a two-state model [6,7].
for this study, we examined 16 molecular dynamic (md)
simulations of full agonists, partial agonists and an antagonist
of the wild-type and two mutant b2ars. the d130a mutant
changed the aspartate residue  xxxd130xxx  in the dry portion of  xxxg2318xxx 
to alanine. this mutation removes a negatively charged residue
from the  xxxg92xxx  and produces a constitutively active receptor in
at least two separate systems [14,40]. the other mutant is the
d113e that replaces the aspartate residue  xxxd113xxx  (d3.32) with a
glutamate residue. this mutation does not alter the net charge
of the receptor, but profoundly alters ligand efficacies causing
both the antagonist  xxxd2957xxx  and the full agonist norepinephrine
to behave like partial agonists [19]. this behavior is examined
through these simulations of  xxxg92xxx  activation within the
context of this two-state acid–base model for gpcr activation.
2. methodology
2.1. the molecular model
the  xxxg92xxx  model displayed in fig. 1 was developed and
further refined from the ‘‘what-if’’ structures produced by
vriend at the embl labs in heidelberg, which is based upon
baldwin et al.’s general model [20]. the d130a and d113e
mutant structures were also modified from this  xxxg92xxx  model.
for this model, the change of the sulfhydryl group in c106 is
associated with the acid and base states in the  xxxg92xxx  (see
fig. 1), which allows the sulfhydryl group to exist in either acid
or base states (sh or s) [16]. since the conserved cys106 is
located near the extracellular region, nearby water molecules
would be expected to influence or modulate this electrostatic
switch, but we did not model this possibility.
the receptor models comprising the seven transmembrane
regions were constructed with the program quanta. the loop
regions were not considered in this particular model although
future work may require the inclusion of these elements. all
hydrogen atoms were included explicitly. standard charmm
charges were applied to all receptor atoms except for the base
state of the cysteine (c106 or c3.25) in which case the charges
were derived from a calculation of the molecule ethyl sulfide
with a 6–31g basis set using the hartree–fock method. the
calculated charges were then scaled and adapted to charmm
format. ligand models in the form of cations were built with the

fig. 1. (a) the  xxxg92xxx  model as viewed through the plane of the cell membrane
( xxxg2318xxx  is the center solid red ribbon). a includes the initial docking position of
epinephrine (epi) as a representative ligand. ligands were manually docked in
the acid receptor state with no initial refinement of the side chains. the spacefilled residue at the top is the highly conserved cysteine residue c106 (c3.25 or
cysiii:01), which provides a free sulfhydryl or thiol group (yellow) in either an
acid or base state (sh or s). the space-filled residues at the bottom are the
critical dry region near the intracellular end of the receptor. (b) the sequences
for this  xxxg92xxx  model are refined from ‘‘what-if’’ structures proposed by vriend
(http://www.gpcr.org/7tm/models/vriend2/index.html) and based upon baldwin
et al.’s model [20]. the c106, in which the sulfhydryl group was modeled in
either the acid, sh; or base, s, state, is labeled in  xxxg2318xxx . the two mutants,
d113e and d130a, which occur in  xxxg2318xxx , are listed below the sequences.

program quanta. each ligand model was constructed with
the chirality corresponding to the most active form. the models
for epinephrine and norepinephrine had chirality r and the
model for  xxxd2957xxx  had chirality s. charges were determined
from calculations with the program gaussian-98 using 6–
31g* basis sets with the hartree–fock method. energy
minimization and molecular dynamics calculations were done
by using the set of programs charmm (version 24).
the ligand was docked into the acid form of the receptor
with the cysteine in the acid state (sh) using facilities of the
program quanta. the ligand was positioned near enough to
form a salt bridge with either the aspartate  xxxd113xxx  in the wild type
receptor or the glutamate e113 in the d113e mutant receptor.
the position of the ligand in the acid state was also used as the
starting position for docking in the base state (s).
subsequent calculations and molecular dynamic simulations
were done with the c106 in either the uncharged sh (acid) or
charged s (base) state. initial receptor minimization included
sequential intervals of steepest descent, conjugate gradient, and
adopted basis newton–raphson. the dynamics calculations
included heating to 310 k (30 ps), equilibration (50 ps), and
simulation (200 ps) portions. the lengths of the bonds
involving hydrogen atoms were constrained according to the
shake algorithm, allowing an integration time step of
0.001 ps. integration of newton’s equation of motion was done
by using the verlet algorithm.
harmonic constraints with a force constant of 0.5 were
applied in order to maintain the structure of the receptor
backbone. a dielectric constant of 4.0 was used to emphasize
electrostatic interactions between the ionized cysteine and the
rest of the receptor since the electrostatic interactions computed
generally take place within the protein interior in the absence of
intervening solvent. a cut-off distance of 60 å was used to
model the distant interactions between the ionized cysteine and
the rest of the system. equilibration was observed after 50 ps
for all runs. for each run, the minimized average structures used
for the analyses were taken from the last 5 ps of the simulations.
sixteen molecular dynamics (md) simulations were
analyzed for this study comprising eight acid–base pairs with
the c106 cysteine in either the sh or s states. the md
simulations included the wild type (wt), and two mutant
b2ars with and without bound ligands as described in table 1.
these include each of the following receptor systems in acid
and base states: the wild-type (wt)  xxxg92xxx  alone and with the
ligands epinephrine (epi), norepinephrine (ne) and  xxxd2957xxx 
(pin); the d113e mutant alone and with the ligands ne and
pin; the d130a mutant alone.
we understand that this  xxxg92xxx  model without loops, in
vacuum, with backbone restraints may not completely validate
a gpcr activation hypothesis, but hope that it will be
considered in the larger context of the experimental and
theoretical data that it attempts to explain.

3.1. differences between the acid and base states
fig. 2a and b displays the electrostatic potentials for the
acid and base states of the  xxxg92xxx  plotted for the positive (blue)
and negative (red) potentials. these figures all have the same
orientation as the  xxxg92xxx  model displayed in fig. 1. fig. 2a and
b show that the transition of c106 from the uncharged acid
state (rsh) to the charged base state (rs) produces a change
from an electrophilic (blue) to a more nucleophilic (red) state.
this is consistent with the base state (rs) preferentially
attracting the positively charged cationic amine group of
binding ligands and thereby creating a higher affinity state
consistent with previous results [16].

 xxxg92xxx  model in fig. 1a with the extracellular end at the top of the picture and
 xxxg2318xxx  as the solid red ribbon. the space-filled residue at the top is the highly
conserved cysteine residue c106 (c3.25 or cysiii:01), which provides a free
thiol group (yellow) in an acid–base equilibrium between uncharged (rsh) and
charged (rs) states. the space-filled residues at the bottom are the dry
region near the intracellular region of the  xxxg92xxx . the electrostatic potentials are
plotted as positive 25 (blue) and negative 25 kj mol1 (red) meshes in both a
and b. the acid state corresponds to the uncharged rsh or ‘‘r’’ receptor state in
this model. (b) plot of the base state with the same orientation as shown for the
 xxxg92xxx  model in fig. 1a and the acid state in a. the base state corresponds to the
charged rs or ‘‘r*’’ receptor state. portions of these composite pictures were
generated with the swiss-pdbviewer (from ref. [51]).

after performing the md simulations representing a
composite of several molecular structures that exist around
the equilibrium energy, we analyzed various properties of the
average structures. fig. 3 displays the root mean square
deviations (rmsds) for the acid and base differences of the
conserved residues in the wild type  xxxg92xxx  (labeled ‘‘*’’)

401

together with those residues displaying a rmsd greater than
1 å. except for the arginine r3.50 (r131), the other conserved
residues show less than 1 å difference. this suggests that these
residues may function as a scaffold that is not as dynamically
mobile as other parts of the  xxxg92xxx .
the distances between the alpha carbons of r131 and  xxxd130xxx 
in  xxxg2318xxx  and the alpha carbons of the residues within the other
helices were generally shorter in the acid than in the base state
suggesting that the base structure is somewhat larger than the
acid structure (not shown).
the distance between the r131 and  xxxd130xxx  alpha carbons in
the dry region may also be affected by the strength of the salt
bridge and the loss of this stabilizing interaction in the base
state as discussed below.
if the extra negative charge in the base state shows a higher
affinity for the positively charged agonist ligands, then we must
nevertheless explain why antagonist ligands do not favor the
base over the acid receptor state. in order to understand this, we
analyzed the acid–base interaction energy differences of the
average molecular structures in more detail.
the charmm energy differences for the wt, d113e and
d130a  xxxg92xxx  mutants are displayed in table 1 for the base
minus acid difference (b  a). apart from the extra negative
charge on the thiol group, the base state of the wt  xxxg92xxx  has a
higher overall charmm energy than the acid state (see
de(b  a), table 1).
in both the d113e and d130a mutant receptors, the base
state also has a higher charmm energy than the acid state
although the total energy change, de(b  a), is less than that
for the wt  xxxg92xxx . the higher energy of the base state in the
wt and the mutant b2ars may be partly attributed to the
repulsion energy between the negative charge on the ionized
sulfhydryl group (rs) and the other negatively charged
regions such as the backbone oxygens and the carboxyl group
of  xxxd113xxx , which is two helical turns (about 10.8 å) away from
the cysteine c106. overall, the total charmm energy profile
suggests that the acid state is energetically more favored than
the base state in the unliganded native conformation, which is
expected if the native receptor exists primarily in an off
conformational state.
for the agonist-bound receptors in almost all cases, the
difference in the charmm energies favors the base state over
the acid state, whereas the antagonist  xxxd2957xxx  pin showed an
energy pattern that is contrary to this. this may be partially due
to a larger dlj(b  a) energy difference for pin compared to
the agonist ligands (see table 1).
for the d113e and d130a mutant receptors, there is a lower
energy difference compared to the that for the wt receptor
alone (compare de(b  a) 33.9 with 10.4 and 10.6 kcal/mol in
table 1). interestingly, the overall charmm energy differences for these mutations are very similar but result from
differing intramolecular forces. for the d130a mutant, the
charmm energy of the del(b  a) difference decreases
dramatically from 15.7 to 0.1 kcal/mol. in contrast, the d113e
mutant shows charmm energy differences for the base minus
acid states (b  a) that result from each of the separate energy
terms dlj, del, die and de as shown in table 1. these

or those residues with the rmsd(b  a)  1 å.

observations suggest that there may be a lower energy barrier for
the overall acid to base transition for these mutant b2ars
resulting from different molecular interactions.
for the unbound wild-type receptor, the transmembrane
(tm) domain interaction energies for the base minus acid states
(b  a) are plotted in fig. 4 for all possible tm pairs. these
energy differences range from a low of 3 kcal/mol for
tm2  3 to a high of 18 kcal/mol for tm6  7 followed
closely by 16 kcal/mol for  xxxg2318xxx   4.
the largest total energy changes occur in tm6  7 and
 xxxg2318xxx   4 followed by  xxxg2318xxx   6, tm1  7 and  xxxg2318xxx   5
(fig. 4). the largest changes in the electrostatic energy (del)
occur for the  xxxg2318xxx   4 and tm6  7 interactions; whereas, the
largest changes in the lennard–jones energy (dlj) occur for
the  xxxg2318xxx   6 and tm6  7 interactions (fig. 4).
this suggests that these major helical interactions are
perturbed by the transition from an acid to base receptor state
apart from any ligand binding. tm7 also appears to be strongly

connected indirectly through the electrostatic interactions
between tm6 and tm7. these interactions demonstrate the
complex dynamics associated with the acid to base transition.
3.2. differences in interaction energies and their
correlation with ligand efficacies
the smaller ligands have a larger positive charge density and
a more favorable interaction with the negatively charged
cysteine in the base state suggesting that their relative efficacies
may be related to their charge densities and their ability to
interact with the base receptor state [16].
the charmm energy differences, de(b  a), for the
ligands epi, ne, and pin bound to the wt receptor are 3.8,
10.6, and +7.7 kcal/mol, respectively (table 1). when
norepinephrine and  xxxd2957xxx  are bound with the d113e mutant
receptor, the values of the charmm energy difference are
8.3 and 12.3 kcal/mol, respectively (see the de(b  a)
values for d113e + pin and d113e + ne in table 1). a partial
explanation may be that for the ne and pin ligands complexed
with the d113e mutant receptor, the average distances between
the ligands and the receptor increase in comparison with those
in the wild-type complexes, which may be due to the slightly
longer sidechain on the glutamate residue in the d113e mutant.
the rmsds were calculated for the acid and base states of
the unbound receptor state and the ligand-bound receptor. the
greatest rmsds occur within tm6 and are greater for the full
agonists, epi and ne, than for the antagonist, pin (not shown).
however, we could not consistently connect the rmsds of
any specific residue to the experimental ligand efficacies.
although tm7 showed a larger rmsd with pin in the d113e
mutant than in the wt receptor (not shown), this may be
partially attributed to the displacement of pin by the larger
glutamate residue, which places the ligand closer to tm7.
in contrast, the electrostatic interaction energies (ddeel)
show that pin in the d113e mutant receptor has a larger ddeel
than for pin bound to the wt  xxxg92xxx . one reason for this may
be that the basic nitrogen of pin is closer to c106, which

generates a larger ddeel in the d113e mutant. as a result, the
electrostatic interaction energy of pin with the negatively
charged c106 residue is greater, which provides an explanation
for the increased efficacy of  xxxd2957xxx  as primarily due to the
increased electrostatic favoring of the base state in the d113e
mutant.
the calculated ddeel energies for wt + pin were
4.7 kcal/mol versus 6.4 kcal/mol for the d113e + pin,
which are in good agreement with the experimentally observed
increase in the experimentally measured percent sodium floride
activity as shown in table 2.
for the wild-type receptor with the ne ligand, the calculated
ddeel was 14.4 kcal/mol; whereas for the d113e mutant
receptor with ne, the ddeel was 5.5 kcal/mol suggesting a
diminution in the efficacy of ne in the mutant consistent with
previous experimental findings [19] (see table 2). these
findings are consistent with the observations from strader’s
group that the d113e mutation changes pin from an antagonist
to a partial agonist and reduces the activity of ne to that of a
partial agonist [19].
in order to further understand the effects of ligand
occupancy on the  xxxg92xxx , we examined the transmembrane
(tm) interaction energy differences for the acid and base states
in the epi bound wt receptor. in general, the binding of epi
changes the interaction energy differences of he base minus
acid states (b  a) from positive to negative for the tm1  7,
 xxxg2318xxx   4,  xxxg2318xxx   6 and tm6  7 interactions (see fig. 5a).
this suggests that one of the actions produced by epi binding is
to increase the magnitude of the tm interactions between
tm1  7,  xxxg2318xxx   4,  xxxg2318xxx   6 and tm6  7 in the base state of
the receptor. many of these interactions have been previously
linked either directly or indirectly to receptor activation [9–15].
with the wt  xxxg92xxx  bound epi, the  xxxg2318xxx   4 interaction
energy changes from a positive 16 to a negative 23 kcal/mol
suggesting that there is a closer interaction of  xxxg2318xxx  and tm4 in
the base state. the  xxxg2318xxx   4 interaction is also the largest
interaction measured for all of the epi induced interaction
energy changes shown in table 3a.
the interdomain interaction energy differences for the
antagonist pin in the wt receptor show an opposite pattern
from the epi and other activating ligands (compare fig. 5a and
f and table 3a). although pin binding reduces the positive
interaction energy differences for tm1  7,  xxxg2318xxx   4,
 xxxg2318xxx   6 and tm6  7, pin fails to make them negative.
this suggests that the weaker electrostatic interaction energy

change (ddeel) for the pin binding translates into tm
interaction energy changes that fail to reach a critical threshold
value for receptor activation. this may be a key difference
between the antagonist and agonist ligands.
for the mutant d113e + pin receptor system,  xxxg2318xxx   4 and
 xxxg2318xxx   6 become negative suggesting an activating pattern that
is supported by previous experimental observations showing
partial agonist activity [19,40]. from this analysis,  xxxg2318xxx   4
changing from positive to negative emerges as a consistent
predictor for all of the activating ligands and mutations in this
study.
to further isolate the effects of ligand binding, we subtracted
the tm energy differences of the wt(b  a) from the other
receptor systems in order to see the net effect of the bound
ligands. these results are displayed in table 3b. this highlights
those differences created by ligands or mutations that change
the tm energy patterns of the unbound wt  xxxg92xxx .
by this analysis, the largest effect of epi binding is more
readily seen for the  xxxg2318xxx   4, tm6  7,  xxxg2318xxx   6 and
tm1  7 interdomain interaction energies (table 3b). these
changes are largely consistent with the tm interaction energies
in table 3a, but more clearly demonstrate that the net effect of
ligand binding centers around the major  xxxg2318xxx   4, tm6  7,
 xxxg2318xxx   6 and tm1  7 interactions.
in the receptor systems with the largest agonist activity, the
 xxxg2318xxx   4 and tm6  7 interactions are also the largest
(table 3b). the pattern of tm interaction energies for the
mutant d130a receptor compared to the epi bound wt
receptor also displays a strong correlation (r = 0.90 in fig. 6)
suggesting that this may be a general pattern for both ligand
and constitutive receptor activation. these general patterns
support christopoulos and kenakin’s concept of protean

agonism by demonstrating that there exist similar activation
patterns that vary around a common theme for activating
ligands and mutations [41].
these findings also demonstrate that although  xxxd2957xxx  is an
antagonist, it contains some elements, albeit weaker, within its
interaction pattern in common with the full agonist epinephrine.
parts of these patterns may represent energies that fail to reach a
threshold energy change for receptor activation since the pin
energy differences in table 3b are generally smaller than those
for the agonist ligands.
however, in the d113e mutant receptor, the antagonist
 xxxd2957xxx  changes to a partial agonist and norepinephrine
activity decreases approximately 50% to that of a partial
agonist. this occurs in our analysis by the alteration of key tm
domain interaction energies such as the changes in the
 xxxg2318xxx   4 and  xxxg2318xxx   6 for pin (compare fig. 5d and f)
and those for the  xxxg2318xxx   4 and tm6  7 for ne (compare
fig. 5c and b).
in contrast, the accompanying changes to the tm domain
interaction energy differences for d113e + pin compared to

wt + pin show a more negative energy pattern for the
 xxxg2318xxx   4,  xxxg2318xxx   6 and tm6  7 interactions in the d113e
mutant consistent with a higher activity for pin in this mutant
(tables 3a and 3b).
if the constitutively active mutant d130a is assumed to have
approximately the same activity as the d113e + pin system,
then the tm6  7 interdomain interaction energy differences
listed in table 3b correlate well with the experimentally
measured relative intrinsic efficacies listed in table 2 (%naf).
interestingly, there is also a good correlation between all of the
other ligand bound and mutant receptors with their experimentally reported activities (r = 0.94 with the d130a, or
r = 0.92 without the d130a mutant).

the protonation and movement of r131 (r3.50) has been
previously suggested as a potential mechanism for receptor
activation [13,40,42]. previously in the two-state acid–base
model for the  xxxg1113xxx , the charged cysteine was
observed to have long range electrostatic interactions with the
aspartate and arginine residues within the dry region [16].
in the present study, the acid to base change of c106 is
accompanied by a corresponding displacement of the aspartate
and arginine in the dry region of the  xxxg92xxx  (0.7 and 1.7 å,
respectively) (fig. 3). this demonstrates that the acid to base
transition perturbs r131 enough to disrupt this bonding. this
suggests that deprotonation of c106 followed by a separate
protonation of r131 may be a feasible molecular mechanism
for the transmission of an extracellular signal to the
intracellular side of the receptor.
all of the possible pairs of tm domain interaction energy
differences demonstrate complex patterns for both the
electrostatic (del) and lennard–jones (dlj) interactions as
shown in fig. 4 for the wild-type  xxxg92xxx . the largest
perturbations occur for the del energies of the  xxxg2318xxx   4
and tm6  7 interactions and the dlj energies of the  xxxg2318xxx   6
and tm6  7 interactions.

l.a. rubenstein et al. / journal of molecular graphics and modelling 25 (2006) 396–409

for all of the md simulations, the most consistent change
accompanying receptor activation is the change of the  xxxg2318xxx   4
interaction energy from positive to negative together with the
ddeel becoming more negative. this is observed for all of the
active systems we studied; wt + epi, wt + ne, d113e + ne,
d130a and d113e + pin, shown in fig. 5a–e. these tm
domain interactions may in turn affect the second and third
intracellular loops (icl2 and icl3), which are considered to be
important in receptor-g protein-coupling [15,30]. these
interactions may produce a repositioning of the arginine in
the polar pocket surrounding the dry region demonstrating
that our relatively simple model generates complex electrostatic and conformational changes within the  xxxg92xxx  that link
tm changes to previously recognized patterns of receptor
activation [5,13,21,40].
4. discussion
this work tests a two-state acid–base model for an ionizable
cysteine residue found within all gpcrs. this cysteine is
strategically located two-helical turns or about 10.8 å above
the important aspartate residue  xxxd113xxx  in  xxxg2318xxx  that forms a
counterion with the protonated amine of catecholamine ligands
in adrenergic receptors [30]. the acid–base transition of this
cysteine, c106 in the  xxxg92xxx , modulates the internal energies of
the receptor and the interaction energies of various ligands that
interact with the  xxxg92xxx  in ways that correlate well with
previously observed transmembrane domain interactions and
the experimentally measured ligand efficacies (table 2 and
fig. 6). although it would be preferable to have a larger
sampling of ligands with their experimental efficacies, these
simulations taken together with previous studies suggest that
those ligands that activate the  xxxg92xxx  also show a preferential
electrostatic attraction for the base form of the receptor state
[16].
previous two-state models for gpcr activation have been
considered to represent a simplification of the available
conformational space [2,43]. however, single-molecule spectroscopy of the  xxxg92xxx  receptor has recently suggested that there
are two distinct states with a population enrichment of one state
occurring when bound with agonist molecules [43]. the authors
of this study suggested that there is a population of active
receptor states that are separate from the active states in the
native receptor, which appears contrary to the findings from
bond et al. [1].
one possible way to resolve these seemingly contradictory
findings is through the interpretation that our two-state model
provides that allows for a net enrichment of the active state
through either receptor overexpression or ligand binding [6–8].
on the molecular level, we have determined that the discrete
molecular states rsh and rs connect the mathematically
general r and r* states to electrostatic interaction energy
changes (ddeel) that closely correlate with their experimentally measured ligand efficacies as seen previously for the 5ht2a receptor [16]. this suggests a molecular basis for the r
to r* shift in the receptor equilibrium as a measure for the net
receptor response and supports the concept that cysteine

modulation of ligand binding may be an important mechanism
to explain how ligands activate these receptors [16].
although this picture may be more complex than previously
characterized, the acid–base transition of c106 clearly creates
energy perturbations that are largely compatible with many
previous experimental findings [9–15]. in the unliganded wildtype  xxxg92xxx , the tm1  7,  xxxg2318xxx   4,  xxxg2318xxx   5,  xxxg2318xxx   6 and
tm6  7 interactions are all strongly positive for the unbound
wt (b  a) states of the  xxxg92xxx  (gray bars in fig. 4 and the
black bars in fig. 5a–g). however, these interactions switch
from positive to negative upon the binding of epinephrine with a
rank order of  xxxg2318xxx   4 > tm6  7 >  xxxg2318xxx   6 > tm1  7
(fig. 5a).
in addition, the  xxxg2318xxx   4 interaction also changes from
positive in the unbound d113e mutant to negative in the pin
bound d113e mutant, which suggests a possible threshold
activation energy for this interaction (compare fig. 5g with d).
all of the md simulations of the receptor systems experimentally shown to be active, wt + epi, wt + ne, d113e + ne,
d130a and d113e + pin, consistently show that the  xxxg2318xxx   4
interaction energy changes from a positive to negative value
(table 3a). although more work needs to be done to support
this finding, at least one study has implicated tm4 in the
activation of the m1 muscarinic receptor [44].
one of the more subtle changes involves the d113e
mutation that changes  xxxd2957xxx  from an antagonist in the wt
 xxxg92xxx  to a partial agonist in the d113e mutant [19]. to our
knowledge there have been no other theoretical models that
have explained this experimental finding. however from our
simulations, the change from an aspartate to glutamate creates a
larger difference in  xxxd2957xxx ’s interactions between the acid and
base states, which is directly reflected in the ddeel energy
difference and the changes in the tm interaction energies. this
is most evident by the  xxxg2318xxx   4 and  xxxg2318xxx   6 interactions,
which change from positive for the wt + pin to negative for
the d113e + pin system (compare table 2 and  xxxg2318xxx   4 and
 xxxg2318xxx   6 in fig. 5d and f).
unlike the agonist ligands in the wild-type  xxxg92xxx ,  xxxd2957xxx 
fails to make the  xxxg2318xxx   4, tm6  7,  xxxg2318xxx   6 and tm1  7
interaction energies negative, which represents a crucial
difference between the agonist and antagonist ligands. this
molecular mechanism elucidates these subtle changes within
the dynamic patterns of  xxxg92xxx  activation.
further experimental observations suggest that some liganddependent conformations favor one particular g protein over
another as a basis for protean agonism [2]. although epi and
ne are about equally effective at activating the  xxxg92xxx , their tm
interactions show some unique differences. for the ne bound
 xxxg92xxx , all of the major tm interactions except for  xxxg2318xxx   6
change from positive to negative; whereas for the epi bound
receptor the  xxxg2318xxx   6 also changes from positive to negative
(fig. 5a and b). however, their overall tm changes show
similar patterns and display a strong correlation relative to the
acid–base changes of the wt receptor (r = 0.83).
these common patterns are comprised of changes in the
tm1  7,  xxxg2318xxx   4,  xxxg2318xxx   6 and tm6  7 interaction energy
differences (tables 3 and 4). interestingly, the constitutively

l.a. rubenstein et al. / journal of molecular graphics and modelling 25 (2006) 396–409

active mutant d130a also displays a similar pattern of tm
interactions compared to the epi bound receptor suggesting a
common pattern for receptor activation (figs. 5a and e and 6).
this supports the concept that protean agonism arises naturally
from ligand or mutation specific patterns due to variations in
internal interaction energies that may favor receptor binding to
one particular g protein over another.
in comparison with rhodopsin, sakmar et al. implicated the
h-bond networks linking the tm1  7,  xxxg2318xxx   4,  xxxg2318xxx   6
and tm6  7 interactions to receptor activation [15] and
ballesteros et al. showed that the charge-neutralizing mutation
of  xxxd130xxx  in  xxxg2318xxx  of the  xxxg92xxx  to asparagine (d130n) led to a
significant increase in basal and  xxxd2957xxx -stimulated camp
accumulation, which was thought to be due to an increase in the
relative motions of  xxxg2318xxx  to tm6 [13,14]. in the context of our
model, these tm interaction changes arise from the acid to base
transition alone.
the ‘‘protonation hypothesis’’ for  xxxg92xxx  activation suggests
that the protonation of the aspartic/glutamatic acid residue in the
d/ery portion of the cytoplasmic side of  xxxg2318xxx  is a key event for
initiating receptor activation [21]. the constitutively active
d130a mutation is thought to free the arginine r131 or r3.50
within the critical dry region [14,40], which suggests that the
protonation of the  xxxd130xxx  or d3.49 frees this arginine to move out
of the polar pocket [13]. this is also supported by the
experimental finding that in isolated  xxxg92xxx  membrane preparations decreasing ph favors receptor activation in vitro [45].
in the context of our model, the existence of at least two
different ph-sensitive residues on both interior and external
sides of the receptor may complicate these interpretations since
another study has shown that an increase in external ph
increases receptor activation [46]. this still raises the important
question of how activating ligands that bind to the extracellular
region might induce the protonation of acidic residues on the
cytoplasmic side of the receptor. in our model, the aspartate and
arginine within the dry region move by 0.7 and 1.7 å (fig. 3),
which may be enough to disrupt an intramolecular bond such as
a salt bridge. this would reconcile the observations that either
an acidic or basic ph may promote receptor activation, since the
differing ph-sensitivities of the two residues cys 106 or asp
130 may be involved on both the extracellular and intracellular
side of the receptor in the cell membrane.
recent experimental observations of receptor dimerization
together with parallel receptor activation studies demonstrate
that receptor dimer formation enhances receptor activation
[47,48]. zeng and wess produced the first direct evidence for
the existence of muscarinic receptor dimers formed from two
conserved cysteine residues, c140 and c220 located on the
extracellular side of the receptor with c140 corresponding to
c106 of the  xxxg92xxx  [47].
in the  xxxg656xxx  ( xxxg656xxx ), javitch and co-workers
showed that the site of crosslinking occurs at c168 on the
extracellular end of tm4 and concluded that cross-linking does
not impair the ability of dopamine to activate the d2ar,
demonstrating that the receptor can bind dopamine and activate
gi with a disulfide bond between the c168 residue in each
subunit of the dimer [49]. these observations suggest that the

407

active receptor state remains within the receptor dimers
themselves.
the possible role for a dimeric species in  xxxg92xxx  signaling
was discovered when it was found that receptor ligands affect
the monomer:dimer equilibrium [48].  xxxd2401xxx  increased
the relative amount of dimer by 45% and also protected the
dimer from the disruptive effect of the tm6 peptide [48]. these
results suggest that  xxxd2401xxx  stabilizes the  xxxg92xxx  dimer
even in the absence of g proteins, which is compatible with our
model.
for any particular redox environment, there necessarily
occurs an equilibrium between disulfide bonds and free
sulfhydryls, which are then free to be influenced by the
environmental ph. if two receptors dimerize by forming a
disulfide bond, they will necessarily produce a pair of free
sulfhydryls, because the four cysteine residues of the two
disulfide bonds form only a single disulfide bond, thereby
leaving two sulfhydryl groups free. this is a chemical
disproportionation reaction that happens when a substance
can be simultaneously oxidized and reduced, thereby allowing
the formation of free sulfhydryl groups.
we tested an extension of our previous model [16] in the larger
context of past modelling efforts. although this  xxxg92xxx  model
without loops, in vacuum, with backbone restraints may not
completely validate a gpcr activation hypothesis, our model
offers a potentially powerful approach to modelling two-state
interactions as the differences in interaction energies. these
simulation results provide new insights into the relationships
observed between selected biochemical data and the structural
interactions that occur during receptor activation.
in summary, these findings place the activation of the  xxxg92xxx 
into a dynamic and general molecular model that explains many
aspects of how ligands or mutations alter the  xxxg92xxx  to produce
activation. these findings generally support kenakin’s concept
of protean agonism through a mechanism that describes ligand
biased conformational change and suggest that there are multiple
ways to activate and allosterically modulate the  xxxg92xxx  [2,50].
this model also relates the transmembrane domain motions of
gpcrs to explicit receptor states and demonstrates that many
elements from several different models may be important parts of
a bigger view of receptor activation. hopefully, this work will
cultivate an appreciation for receptor function in terms of a
general, two-state acid–base model that will present fruitful
alternatives for the modeling of gpcr activation in the future.
5. conclusions
the major conclusions from this work are:
(1) the electrostatic interaction energy changes correlate well
with the experimentally observed ligand efficacies.
(2) the interaction energy changes for the helical/transmembrane domain interactions are generally compatible with
previously described events for gpcr activation.
(3) this molecular model ties together many experimental and
theoretical findings observed for the  xxxg92xxx  and other
gpcrs.
