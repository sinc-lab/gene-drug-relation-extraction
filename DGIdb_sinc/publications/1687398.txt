effects of (+/-)- (+)- and (-)-metoprolol, (+/-)- (+)- and (-)- xxxd2957xxx , (+/-)-mepindolol and (+/-)- xxxd356xxx  on the rat left atria and portal vein.  1. the effects of (+/-)- (+)- and (-)-metoprolol, (+/-)- (+)- and (-)- xxxd2957xxx , (+/-)-mepindolol and (+/-)- xxxd356xxx  on the beta 1-adrenoceptor mediated responses of the rat left atria and the beta 2-adrenoceptor mediated responses of the rat portal vein to  xxxd2398xxx  have been determined. 2. racemic and (-)-metoprolol were selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonists. (+)-metoprolol was devoid of beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic activity. 3. racemic and (-)- xxxd2957xxx  were potent and (+)- xxxd2957xxx  was a modest beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. 4. (+/-)-mepindolol and (+/-)- xxxd356xxx  were apparently competitive antagonists of the  xxxd2398xxx  beta 1-adrenoceptor mediated responses of the rat left atria but non-competitive antagonists of the  xxxd2398xxx  beta 2-adrenoceptor mediated responses of the rat portal vein. 5. it is suggested that (+/-)-mepindolol and (+/-)- xxxd356xxx  are slowly dissociating beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and the non-competitive antagonism can only be detected on tissues with modest receptor reserves for maximum responses to  xxxd2398xxx .
