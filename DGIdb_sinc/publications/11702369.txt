abstract
▲  xxxd330xxx  is a selective retinoid x receptor (rxr) agonist. it binds

to, and activates rxrs which function as ligand-activated transcription factors that control gene expression. this leads to modulation
of cell growth, apoptosis, and differentiation.
▲ in patients with refractory or persistent early stage cutaneous t cell

lymphoma ( xxxg2343xxx ), the overall response rate was 54% after oral
 xxxd330xxx  300 mg/m2/day. the overall response rate in patients
with refractory or persistent advanced stage  xxxg2343xxx  was 45% at the
same dosage.
▲ an overall response rate of 63% was reported after topical

 xxxd330xxx  0.1 to 1% twice daily in patients with early stage  xxxg2343xxx .
another trial reported an overall response rate of 44% after topical
 xxxd330xxx  1% once daily escalated up to 4 times daily.
▲ plaque elevation was significantly reduced, and the severity of mod-

erate to severe psoriasis was substantially improved in patients receiving oral  xxxd330xxx  0.5 to 2 mg/kg/day.
▲ at clinically relevant oral dosages,  xxxd330xxx  significantly de-

creases levels of serum  xxxd3368xxx  and free thyroxine.
▲ the most common adverse events associated with oral  xxxd330xxx 

are hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, central hypothyroidism and headache. reversible acute pancreatitis has occurred
during oral  xxxd330xxx  therapy.
▲ adverse events associated with the topical formulation are limited

to rash, pruritus, and pain.

 xxxd330xxx 

cutaneous t cell lymphoma ( xxxg2343xxx ), a subclass of non-hodgkin’s lymphoma, is the most common primary cutaneous lymphoma. it is characterized by infiltration of the skin by malignant
clonal helper cd4+ t lymphocytes.[1,2] mycosis fungoides and
sézary syndrome are the most common forms of  xxxg2343xxx .[3] manifestations of  xxxg2343xxx  include patches, plaques, tumors and erythroderma.[4] the duration of  xxxg2343xxx  is unpredictable, ranging from
months to decades. patients may experience prolonged survival
with minimal morbidity or a fulminant course with rapid dissemination and death.[2,5] the tumor-node-metastasis (tnm) system
is used to classify the stages of  xxxg2343xxx : the stages range from stage
ia (<10% of skin surface covered in plaques, patches or papules)
to stage ivb (generalized erythroderma with involvement of the
visceral organs and lymph nodes).[3,4]
traditionally, treatment options available for  xxxg2343xxx  have included uva and uvb irradiation with or without psoralens or
retinoids, topical and systemic chemotherapies, photopheresis,
electron beam radiation and interferon-alpha.[3] more recently, immunotherapy with t cell vaccination and fusion toxins have become available.[6]
psoriasis is an immunologically-mediated inflammatory disease of the skin characterized by increases in keratinocyte proliferation.[7] the clinical course of plaque psoriasis, the most common form, involves the development of demarcated erythematous
scaling plaques on the skin.[7] treatment options for psoriasis
include corticosteroids, phototherapy, uva and uvb irradiation, vitamin d, immunosuppressants and oral retinoids.[7-9]
retinoids exert their biologic effects on 2 types of receptors:
 xxxd3417xxx  receptors (rar) and retinoic x receptors (rxr).
receptor-ligand complexes are formed upon activation by ligands.
this changes the pattern of gene expression which in turn leads
to alterations in cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis.[10]
 xxxd330xxx  is an rxr-selective retinoid that has demonstrated
activity in diabetes mellitus[11] and in various malignancies.[12-14]
this profile focuses on the use of  xxxd330xxx  in  xxxg2343xxx  and psoriasis.  xxxd330xxx  can be administered either orally or topically.
although both formulations have been used in patients with
 xxxg2343xxx , clinical trials in patients with psoriasis have used the oral
formulation.

•  xxxd330xxx  binds to the rxr receptor and activates it. rxrs
can form heterodimers with a variety of receptor partners including rar,  xxxd1682xxx , thyroid hormone and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors.[10]  xxxd330xxx  exerts its effects by regulating gene expression via the rxr receptor to modulate cell
growth, apoptosis and differentiation.[15-17] when administered
concomitantly with an rar agonist in vitro,  xxxd330xxx  actively
promotes apoptosis via induction of transglutaminase i, a protein
cross-linking enzyme that plays a part in induction of apoptosis.[15]
• in myeloid leukemia cell lines  xxxd330xxx  activated rxr receptor subclasses at concentrations of 10–6 mol/l.[18] at the same
concentration,  xxxd330xxx  inhibited proliferation of leukemic
cells by 37%; in comparison other retinoid agonists inhibited proliferation by <20%.[18]  xxxd330xxx  10–7 mol/l increased differentiation of leukemic cells (measured by expression of  xxxg1206xxx 
antigens) up to 7-fold, and the addition of an rar agonist increased cell expression by up to 13-fold.[18]
• no in vitro studies investigating the effects of  xxxd330xxx  on
 xxxg2343xxx  cell lines have been published. consequently, the exact in
vitro effects of  xxxd330xxx  in  xxxg2343xxx  are unknown.[19]
studies in humans

• significant reductions from baseline in levels of serum  xxxd3368xxx  (reduced from 2.2 to 0.05 mu/l; p < 0.001) and free thyroxine (reduced from 12.9 to 5.8 pmol/l; p < 0.001) were seen in
27 patients with  xxxg2343xxx  receiving oral  xxxd330xxx  ≥300
mg/m2/day.[20]
• oral  xxxd330xxx  0.5, 1 or 2 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks significantly and dose-dependently reduced the number of mib-1 positive nuclei (a marker of cell proliferation) compared with baseline numbers in 21 patients with moderate to severe plaque
psoriasis (p < 0.01). compared with baseline values, significant
increases in keratin 10 (a marker of cell differentiation) were
observed (p < 0.01), but percentages of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells
in the epidermis and dermis remained unchanged throughout the
study. additionally, unlike other non-rxr-selective retinoids,
 xxxd330xxx  did not appear to induce keratin 13 expression.[21,22]
2. pharmacokinetic properties
• the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd330xxx  were evaluated
in a phase i study in which 27 patients with various malignancies
received oral  xxxd330xxx  5 to 400 mg/m2/day. marked inter- and
intrapatient variation was noted in plasma  xxxd330xxx  concentrations at all dosage levels. nevertheless, both the mean peak
plasma concentration (cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc) increased proportionally with dose.

absorption of  xxxd330xxx  was increased when administered with
a fat-containing meal. on day 1, a mean cmax of 911 mug/l was
achieved in 2.8 hours and the auc was 2850 mug/l • h in 4 patients
receiving  xxxd330xxx  300 mg/m2/day.[23]

3. therapeutic trials
two formulations of  xxxd330xxx  have been evaluated in clinical trials; an oral capsule and a topical gel formulation. the oral
formulation has been used in the treatment of both cutaneous
manifestations of  xxxg2343xxx  in patients refractory to prior systemic
treatment and in patients with psoriasis. the topical formulation
has been used for the treatment of cutaneous lesions in patients
with refractory or persistent early stage (tnm ia, ib or iia)

• studies in human and animal hepatic microsomes show that
cytochrome p450 enzyme 3a4 (cyp3a4) is involved in the metabolism of  xxxd330xxx  to both hydroxy- and oxo-metabolites.[25]
although specific clinical drug interaction studies have not been
conducted,  xxxd330xxx  has the potential to interact with other
cyp3a4 substrates. inducers and inhibitors of cyp3a4 may affect  xxxd330xxx  plasma concentrations; concomitant gemfibrozil
was associated with increased  xxxd330xxx  plasma concentrations,
whereas atorvastatin had no effect.[19]

•  xxxd330xxx  is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%). however, the uptake of  xxxd330xxx  by organs or tissue has not been
investigated, and it is unknown whether this agent crosses the
blood-brain or placental barriers.[19]
systemic exposure to  xxxd330xxx  following application of the
gel formulation appears to be very low.[24]
• repeated administration of  xxxd330xxx  ≤400 mg/m2/day did
not produce autoinduction of metabolism, and although accumulation of the agent was displayed at doses ≥83 mg/m2/day this was
mostly ≤5% of cmax.[23]

oral formulation

all clinical studies of  xxxd330xxx  in  xxxg2343xxx  have been noncomparative. the maximum tolerated dosage of  xxxd330xxx  in
 xxxg2343xxx  is ≤400 mg/m2/day; dosage reduction was therefore required
in patients treated with higher dosages because of toxicity.[23] the
primary response criterion was overall response rate which was
defined as complete response (complete resolution of all measurable disease) plus partial response (≥50% improvement in disease
manifestations). responses were confirmed for ≥4 study weeks.[27]

dosage (n = 28), the projected median time to first response was
57 (range 27 to 114) days, the projected median time to best
response was 87 (range 27 to 153) days, and 13% of responders
relapsed. after 16 weeks of treatment, 84% of responders reported moderate to very good improvements in quality-of-life
parameters.[29]
• the clinical efficacy of once daily oral  xxxd330xxx  650 mg/m2
(reduced later to 500 then 300 mg/m2/day) was evaluated in a
multicenter phase ii/iii trial in 94 patients with refractory advanced stage (tnm iib to ivb)  xxxg2343xxx . patients had been previously treated with a median of 5 (range 1 to 11) systemic treatment modalities. an overall response was observed in 45% (25
of 56) of patients receiving the recommended dosage of
 xxxd330xxx  300 mg/m2/day, and in 55% (21 of 38) receiving dosages >300 mg/m2/day (fig. 1). patients with stage iib, iii, iva and
ivb  xxxg2343xxx  had overall response rates of 57, 32, 44 and 40%,
respectively. the projected median time to best response was 180
(range 15 to 197) days and the median response duration was 299
(reported range 57 to 299) days at a dosage of 300 mg/m2/day. at
this dosage level, 36% (9 of 25) of responders relapsed after a
median 19.1 weeks of follow-up.[27,28]
• an analysis of data from both phase ii/iii studies[27,29] showed
that 84 patients receiving  xxxd330xxx  300 mg/m2/day had comparable response rates by physician global or composite assessments, regardless of tnm disease stage (fig. 2). however, response rates for the different tnm disease stages were more
variable at dosages >300 mg/m2/day (fig. 2). response rates between 40 to 66.7% were observed for stages ia through to ivb at
>300 mg/m2/day

• in a subset analysis, 9 patients with refractory stage iii  xxxg2343xxx 
(erythroderma stage) initially received  xxxd330xxx  500
mg/m2/day (reduced later to 300 mg/m2/day). responses were
seen in all patients 12 weeks after beginning therapy and as early
as 4 weeks in 3 patients. all patients had clearing of >70% of
cutaneous involvement. after 28 weeks, 2 patients with erythrodermic  xxxg2343xxx , but not sézary syndrome, had achieved a complete
response and 7 had achieved partial responses. although patients
with sézary syndrome (n = 5) had marked cutaneous improvements, there was no significant change in cd4/cd8 ratio and
hematologic abnormalities persisted in the peripheral blood.[31]
topical formulation

• in a phase iii multicenter study, 50 patients with refractory or
persistent early stage (tnm ia to iia)  xxxg2343xxx  initially received
 xxxd330xxx  gel 1% once daily. the dosage frequency was escalated from every other day through to 4 times daily as tolerated.
an overall response was observed in 44% (22 of 50) of patients
and complete response in 8% (4 of 50) of patients. 32% of patients
relapsed and the median duration of treatment was 165 (range 3
to 687) days. a disease-specific quality-of-life questionnaire indicated improvements in general  xxxg2343xxx  status throughout therapy
with  xxxd330xxx .[32]
• in a phase i/ii multicenter study,  xxxd330xxx  gel was applied
to affected areas in 67 patients with early stage  xxxg2343xxx . escalating
dosages from 0.1% once daily to 1% twice daily were used depending on tolerability (87% of patients were treated with the 1%
formulation). the mean duration of therapy was 315 days and the
median time to response was 20 (range 4 to 86) weeks. 63% (42
of 67) of patients had an overall response to treatment of ≥4
weeks’ duration. complete response was seen in 21% (14 or 67)
of patients. the projected median duration of response was 14
months.[33]
• in a preliminary study, 6 patients with stage i  xxxg2343xxx  received
 xxxd330xxx  gel 0.01 to 1% applied 1 to 4 times daily as tolerated.
a complete response was achieved in 56% (10 of 18) of lesions,
and a partial response was recorded in 22% (4 of 18) of lesions.

• adverse events associated with  xxxd330xxx  gel 0.1% once
daily to 1% twice daily (n = 67) were restricted to the application
site. the most frequent events were rash (73% of patients), pruritus (33%) and pain (24%), and these were mostly mild to moderate in severity. treatment-limiting toxicity, which included
pain and rash, occurred in 16 patients; dosage frequency was
decreased in 14 patients.[33]
• these results were mirrored in another phase iii trial of topical
 xxxd330xxx  1% administered to patients in escalating dosage frequency from once to 4 times daily as tolerated. the incidence of
rash, pruritus and pain was 72, 32 and 22%, respectively, and all
events were mild to moderate in severity. no serious treatmentrelated adverse events associated with  xxxd330xxx  gel were documented.[32]
5.  xxxd330xxx : current status

of patients with  xxxg2343xxx  and psoriasis. the oral formulation is approved for use in the us for refractory  xxxg2343xxx , and the topical gel
formulation is pending approval in the us for persistent or refractory early stage  xxxg2343xxx . multicenter trials have demonstrated clinical efficacy of  xxxd330xxx  for these indications. the oral formulation is also being investigated in phase ii clinical trials in
patients with psoriasis, and interim results are encouraging. the
most frequently reported adverse events associated with oral
 xxxd330xxx  are hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, central hypothyroidism and headache.
