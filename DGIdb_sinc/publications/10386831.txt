garcia-gil, l., r. de miguel, j. romero, a. perez, j. a. ramos and j. j. fernández-ruiz. perinatal d9-tetrahydrocannabinol exposure augmented the magnitude of motor inhibition caused by gabab, but not gabaa, receptor agonists in adult rats. neurotoxicol teratol. 21(3) 277–283, 1999.—we have extensively reported that
d9-tetrahydrocannabinol (d9-thc) exposure results in changes in the adult functionality of dopaminergic neurons, in particular, mesotelencephalic pathways, although some changes are evident only after pharmacological challenges. in the present
study, we have examined whether similar changes might be observed in g- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) activity, in particular,
in those regions where cannabinoid receptors have been reported to be located in gaba-containing neurons. to this end,
we first examined gaba content and  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase (gad) activity in several brain regions of adult male and
female rats that had been perinatally exposed to d9-thc or oil. d9-thc exposure did not modify either gad activity or
gaba content in the ventral-tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, substantia nigra, caudate-putamen, and globus pallidus,
thus suggesting no changes in the basal presynaptic activity of gaba-containing neurons. second, we tested the motor response in the open-field test of these animals after a single injection of muscimol, a gabaa receptor agonist, baclofen, a
 xxxg828xxx  agonist, or vehicle. we observed that the motor inhibition caused by baclofen, in terms of decreased ambulation and stereotypy and increased inactivity, was more marked in magnitude in d9-thc–exposed males and females. this
was not observed for the gabaa receptor agonist, muscimol, indicating a receptor specificity. to extend this observation,
we also examined whether the potential differences in the behavioral response found in the above experiment might be due
to changes at the level of the efficiency of the activation of these receptors by measuring basal and baclofen-stimulated [35s]guanylyl-59-o-(g-thio)-triphosphate ([35s]-gtpgs) binding in adult male and female rats that had been perinatally exposed
to d9-thc or oil. however, our results were negative, because perinatal d9-thc exposure did not increase baclofen-stimulated [35s]-gtpgs binding in the areas studied; in particular, in the substantia nigra, an area of interest for the interactions
 xxxg828xxx /cannabinoid receptor. collectively, the present results indicate that although perinatal d9-thc did not produce any changes in gaba content and gad activity in limbic and motor areas in adulthood, it did increase the behavioral
response to  xxxg828xxx  agonists. however, this increase was not due to changes in  xxxg828xxx  activation of signal transduction mechanisms, as revealed the analysis of the percentage of stimulation by baclofen of [35s]-gtpgs binding in
the substantia nigra and other structures of males and females perinatally exposed to d9-thc. © 1999 elsevier science inc.

cannabis sativa preparations (hashish, marihuana) are
able to affect the development and differentiation of the central nervous system in rodents when consumed during prenatal and early postnatal ages, because they can be transferred
from the mother to the offspring through the placental blood
and maternal milk [for review, see (6–9)]. thus, perinatal exposure to cannabinoids markedly affected the maturation of
several neurotransmitter systems, in particular, dopamine
(1,2,24,31,32) and serotonin (16). it was also able to alter the
development of opioidergic neurons (13), even producing a
naloxone-induced withdrawal syndrome at immature ages
(29). in the case of dopaminergic neurons, the changes were
especially marked and constant in male offspring, whereas the
effects in females were usually transient [for review, see (7–
9)]. these effects appeared early, even before the complete
differentiation and maturation of dopaminergic projections
into their target areas (2), in particular, during the last third of
gestation and first week after birth, when cannabinoids were
able to affect the expression of key genes for dopaminergic
neurotransmission (2). all these modifications observed during perinatal and peripubertal periods were followed by important long-term effects on adult behavior, which were also
usually more prevalent in male offspring. thus, adult animals
perinatally exposed to cannabinoids exhibited, among others,
alterations in a variety of behavioral tests indicating male copulatory behavior (5), open-field activity (10,18), learning ability (6), stress response (15), pain sensitivity (29), social interaction and sexual motivation (19), drug seeking behavior (30),
and others [for review, see (6–9)]. in addition, long-term neuroendocrine disturbances have been also reported (4,17).
the studies of vulnerability to drugs of abuse in adult individuals perinatally exposed to d9-tetrahydrocannabinol (d9thc) have been of special interest due to their potential social
relevance. thus, we have recently found that adult female,
but not male, rats self-administered more morphine when
they had been perinatally exposed to d9-thc (30). this effect
seems to be related to a d9-thc-induced increase in m-opioid
receptor binding (30) and decrease in proenkephalin gene expression (3) in specific regions directly or indirectly related to
drug reinforcement. in addition, we have also found that adult
male, but not female, rats that had been perinatally exposed
to d9-thc were tolerant to a new cannabinoid exposure with
regard to the effects of this compound on dopaminergic activity (8). however, this tolerance was not apparently related to
changes at the level of cannabinoid receptor binding and
mrna expression in specific brain regions (garcía-gil,
romero, ramos, and fernández-ruiz, unpublished results).
there are no data, however, on the effects of perinatal d9thc exposure on the development of other neurotransmitters such as g- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba), in particular on
those gaba-containing neurons related to midbrain dopaminergic neurons. these neurons contain cannabinoid receptors in adult individuals (11,12). the activation of these receptors markedly altered gabaergic activity (14,23,25,26). thus,
the present study was designed to state whether the adult
functionality of gaba-containing neurons in motor (caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra) and limbic (nucleus accumbens and ventral-tegmental area) areas
might be altered as a consequence of the contact with d9-thc
during early development. to this end, we have performed
three consecutive experiments. we first examined gaba
content and  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase (gad) activity in
several brain regions of adult male and female rats that had
been perinatally exposed to d9-thc or oil. second, we tested
the motor response in the open-field test of these animals af-

garcia-gil et al.
ter a single injection of muscimol, a gabaa receptor agonist,
baclofen, a  xxxg828xxx  agonist, or vehicle. we finally
examined whether the potential differences in the behavioral
response found in the above experiment might be due to
changes at the level of the efficiency of  xxxg828xxx  activation. we used the method recently developed by sim et al.
(27) to measure basal and baclofen-stimulated [35s]-guanylyl59-o-(g-thio)-triphosphate ([35s]-gtpgs) binding in the substantia nigra and other structures of adult male and female
rats that had been perinatally exposed to d9-thc or oil.
method

animals and perinatal

d9-thc

exposure

female virgin rats of the wistar strain were housed from
birth in a room with a controlled photoperiod (0800–2000 h
light) and temperature (23 6 18c). they had free access to
standard food (panlab, barcelona, spain) and water. at adult
age (.8 weeks of life; 200–250 g), daily vaginal smears were
taken between 1000–1200 h, and only those animals exhibiting
three or more consistent 4-day cycles were used in this study.
females in the proestrous phase were allowed to stay with a
male for mating, and a new vaginal smear was taken on the
next day. those animals showing the presence of sperm cells
were accepted as probably pregnant, and used for the cannabinoid exposure studies. the day on which sperm plugs were
found was designated the first day of gestation. d9-thc, generously supplied by the national institute on drug abuse
(usa), was prepared in a sesame oil solution for administration. pregnant females received a daily oral dose of d9-thc
(5 mg/kg weight) from the fifth day of gestation, according to
our previously published model (1,2,18). control rats were
dosed with vehicle alone. this treatment was maintained until
day 24 after birth, the day on which rats were weaned. then,
male and female offspring were housed separately (four animals per cage) and left to reach adult age (.10 weeks) to be
used for gabaa and  xxxg828xxx  agonist studies or
analysis of gaba content and gad activity and baclofenstimulated [35s]-gtpgs binding in several brain structures.
during the whole treatment period, we recorded a set of gestational and lactational parameters, such as maternal and neonatal weight gain, maternal food and water intake, gestational
length, placental and fetal weights, litter size, and maternal
plasma d9-thc concentrations, to support that potential
adult changes were not due to a possible cannabinoid-induced
nutritional deficit during the perinatal life. these results have
been previously and extensively published (1,18), and are not
included here.
experiments, sampling, and tissue preparation
at adult age (.70 days after birth), both d9-thc– and vehicle-exposed male and female rats were used for three different experiments. in each experiment, six animals per group,
taken from at least three different litters, were used to ensure
the required experimental variation. in experiment i, animals
were sacrificed by rapid decapitation and their brains were
quickly and carefully removed and rapidly frozen by immersion in 2-methyl-butane chilled in dry ice. all samples were
stored at 2708c until processed. the day of analysis, brains
were thawed and used for manually obtaining coronal slices
(around 500-mm thick) at three different levels: (a) substantia
nigra/ventral tegmental area; (b) globus pallidus; and (c) caudate-putamen/nucleus accumbens, according to palkovits and
brownstein (21). afterwards, the five structures were dis-

sected and processed for the analysis of gaba content and
gad activity, as will be described below. in experiment ii,
animals were subjected to a single ip injection of muscimol (1
mg/kg weight), baclofen (2 mg/kg weight) or vehicle (saline).
ten minutes later, animals were subjected to the open-field
test. in experiment iii, animals were sacrificed by rapid decapitation, and their brains were quickly and carefully removed and rapidly frozen by immersion in 2-methyl-butane
chilled in dry ice. coronal sections 20 mm-thick were cut in a
cryostat, according to the paxinos and watson atlas (22). sections were thaw mounted onto rnase-free gelatin/chrome
alum-coated slides and dried briefly at 308c and stored at
2808c until used. for the identification of the different brain
nuclei, sections adjacent to those used for autoradiographic
analysis were stained with cresyl violet and analyzed according to the paxinos and watson atlas (22). sections were stored
at 2708c until processed for the autoradiographic analysis of
[35s]-gtpgs binding as will be described below.

of known concentrations of l-glutamate, gaba and 5-apa)
were injected into the hplc system. this consisted in a spectra-physics 8810 isocratic pump. the column was a rp-18
(spherisorb ods-2; 200 mm, 4.6 mm, 5 mm particle size;
teknokroma, barcelona, spain). the mobile phase, previously filtered and degassed, consisted of 0.06 m sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.06 mm edta and 20–30% methanol
(ph 4.4), and the flow rate was 0.8–1.4 ml/min. the effluent
was monitored with a metrohm bioanalytical system amperometric detector using a glassy carbon electrode. the potential
was 0.85 v relative to an ag/agcl reference electrode with a
sensitivity of 50 na (approx. 2 ng per sample). the signal was
recorded on a spectra-physics 4290 integrator. the approximate retention times for gaba and 5-apa were 8 and 16
min, respectively. the results were given as area under the
peaks and calculated by comparison with the area under the
corresponding internal standard peak. values were expressed
as mg/mg of protein.

open-field test

assay for gad activity

muscimol, baclofen, or vehicle-injected adult male and female rats, that had been perinatally exposed to d9-thc or vehicle, were subjected 10 min after administration to the openfield test. this consisted of a circular floor (diameter: 90 cm)
with a surrounding wall (height: 30 cm), both made of transparent polyvinylchloride. the floor was divided into five inner
and eight outer parts using circles and radial segments. animals were placed in the center of the arena, and they were left
5 min for acclimation (this was done to reduce the effects of
stress derived of a novel environment on the motor response).
after this period, the spontaneous activity of each animal was
recorded on a tv video system for a period of 5 min. the apparatus was washed out with an odoriferous solution after
each rat had been tested. the following parameters were analyzed: (1) ambulation: number of sector crossings (a single
line crossing was defined as the rat placing the four paws into
an adjacent quadrant); (2) frequency of stereotypic behaviors;
and (3) time spent in inactivity. the scoring of the different
behaviors was carried out by investigators who had no knowledge of the treatment of each rat.

the homogenate part used for the analysis of gad activity was also diluted (1/2) with 150 mm potassium phosphate
buffer, ph 6.8, and processed according to nicoletti et al. (20).
briefly, 50 ml of each diluted homogenate were incubated for
30 min at 378c with 50 ml of a mixture of 32 mm l-glutamate
and 1.5 mm  xxxd3047xxx  prepared in phosphate
buffer. after incubation, the reaction was stopped by addition
of 50 ml of 0.4 n perchloric acid containing 0.4 mm sodium
disulfite, 0.90 mm edta and 15 mg/ml 5-apa. blank tubes
for each diluted homogenate were constructed by adding 50
ml of 0.4 n perchloric acid containing 0.4 mm sodium disulfite, 0.90 mm edta and 15 mg/ml 5-apa before incubation. afterwards, both test and blank tubes were centrifuged
for 3 min (15000 3 g), and the supernatants removed. the
analysis of gaba formed was done as previously described
for the direct analysis of gaba content in the same samples.
values for gad activity are expressed as mg of gaba
formed/mg of protein/h.

analysis of gaba content by hplc with
electrochemical detection
analysis of gaba contents in several brain regions were
carried out by hplc with electrochemical detection according to the procedure described by smith and sharp (28).
briefly, the dissected brain regions were homogenized in 20
vol of cold 150 mm potassium phosphate buffer, ph 6.8. each
homogenate was divided into two parts: one-half for the analysis of gaba content, and the other half for the analysis of
gad activity. the homogenate part used for the direct measurement of gaba content was diluted (1/2) with 0.4 n perchloric acid containing 0.4 mm sodium disulfite, 0.90 mm
edta, and 10 mg/ml 5-aminopentanoic acid (5-apa) as internal standard. afterwards, samples were centrifuged for 3
min (15000 3 g) and 50 ml of each supernatant removed and
neutralized with 100 ml of 0.1 n naoh. samples were stored
at 48c until analysis. this was performed by derivatization of
gaba and 5-apa through the addition of 15 ml of o-phthaldehide (opa)-sulfite solution (14.9 mm opa, 45.4 mm sodium sulfite and 4.5% ethanol in 327 mm borate buffer, ph
10.4). samples were allowed to react at room temperature for
a period of 10 min. after this time, 20 ml of each reaction mixture (including derivatizated calibration standards composed

autoradiography of basal and baclofen-stimulated
[35s]-gtpgs binding
the protocol used is basically the method recently described by sim et al. (27). briefly, slide-mounted brain sections were rinsed in assay buffer [50 mm tris, 3 mm mgcl2,
0.2 mm egta, 100 mm nacl, and 0.5% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (fatty acid-free), ph 7.4] at 258c for 10 min, then pretreated for 15 min with an excess concentration (2 mm) of
gdp (boehringer mannheim, barcelona, spain) in assay
buffer. afterwards, sections were incubated at 258c for 2 h in
assay buffer containing 0.04 nm [35s]-gtpgs (amersham
ibérica, madrid, spain), 2 mm gdp, and 600 mm baclofen
(rbi, natick, ma). basal activity was assessed in the absence
of agonist, whereas nonspecific binding was measured in the
presence of 10 mm unlabeled gtpgs (boehringer mannheim).
in pilot experiments, additional brain sections were incubated
in the presence of the  xxxg828xxx  antagonist cgp
35348 (1 mm; generously supplied by ciba-geigy, barcelona,
spain) in addition to 0.04 nm [35s]-gtpgs, 2 mm gdp and
600 mm baclofen. cgp 35348 significantly antagonized the increase in baclofen-stimulated [35s]-gtpgs binding, thus supporting that this increase was caused through activation of
gabab receptors (data not shown). slices were rinsed twice
in 50 mm  xxxd3449xxx , ph 7.4, and once in deionized water,
then dried under a stream of cool dry air. autoradiograms

were generated by apposing the labeled tissues to film (hyperfilm-bmax, amersham ibérica, madrid, spain) for a period of 2 days, and developed (d-19, kodak) for 4 min at
208c. developed films were analyzed and quantitated in a
computer-assisted videodensitometer (image quant 3.3, molecular dynamics).
statistics
the three-way analysis of variance was used to assess the
data on open-field responsiveness after muscimol or baclofen
challenge (sex 3 perinatal treatment 3 challenge) and the data
on basal and baclofen-stimulated [35s]-gtpgs binding (sex 3
perinatal treatment 3 agonist stimulation). data on gaba
contents and gad activity were assessed by two-way analysis
of variance (sex 3 perinatal treatment). in the three cases, student–newman–keuls test was used as the post hoc test.

results

experiment i: analysis of gad activity and gaba content
in this experiment, we examined the effects of the perinatal d9-thc exposure on the presynaptic activity of gabacontaining neurons in motor and limbic areas, by measuring
gad activity and gaba content (see table 1). the two-way
analysis of variance revealed that the variable perinatal treatment, analyzed alone, did not reach statistical significance in
any of the five regions analyzed, either for gad activity or
for gaba content. the interaction of this variable, perinatal
treatment, with the other, sex, did not reach statistical significance either. the variable sex, analyzed alone, exhibited,
however, statistical significance in some cases. for instance,
gaba content in the caudate-putamen were higher in females than males [table 1; f(1, 15) 5 4.24, p , 0.05]. however, this was observed independently of the other variable,
perinatal treatment, as reflected by the absence of changes in
the above-mentioned two-way interactions for each structure.
the remaining areas did not reach any statistically significant
differences with regard to the variable sex, analyzed alone, either for gad activity or for gaba content.

experiment ii: challenges with gaba-a and -b
receptor agonists
in this experiment, we tested the open-field response of
adult males and females that had been perinatally exposed to
d9-thc or oil, to a single administration of a gabaa receptor agonist, muscimol, a  xxxg828xxx  agonist, baclofen,
or vehicle (see table 2). the administration of baclofen produced the expected motor inhibition, reflected by decreased
ambulation and stereotypy and increased inactivity (table 2),
as revealed the three-way analysis of variance [ambulation:
f(1, 36) 5 49.76, p , 0.00005; inactivity: f(1, 36) 5 46.84, p ,
0.00005; stereotypy: f(1, 36) 5 57.19, p , 0.00005]. the variable perinatal treatment did not reach statistical significance
when analyzed alone, thus suggesting that the presence of d9thc during gabaergic development did not alter by itself
the basal motor activity when animals matured (table 2). the
variable sex, analyzed alone, indicated higher frequency of
stereotypy in females than males [table 2; f(1, 36) 5 7.00,
p , 0.05), but independently of the other two variables. no
changes were observed by sex in inactivity and ambulation.
the analysis of the different two-way and three-way interactions for these parameters revealed that the magnitude of
baclofen effects might be affected by the perinatal treatment
with d9-thc in some cases. thus, perinatal treatment 3 challenge interaction did achieve statistical significance for ambulation, f(1, 36) 5 3.28, p , 0.05. as the three-way interaction
for this parameter did not reach statistical significance, this indicated that the effect was seen in both sexes. the transformation of these data to % of change revealed that the decrease in
ambulation was effectively more marked in animals exposed
to d9-thc (females: 281.1%; males: 283.9%) compared with
their respective oil-exposed groups (females: 257.7%; males:
275.4%). no changes were seen for the other two-way interactions, perinatal treatment 3 sex and sex 3 challenge. in the
case of inactivity and frequency of stereotypy, no changes
were seen for the different two-way and three-way interactions, except for the interaction between challenge and sex for
stereotypy, f(1, 36) 5 6.30, p , 0.05, thus reflecting higher effects of baclofen in females than males, but independently of
the perinatal treatment (table 2).
finally, the administration of muscimol also produced the
expected motor inhibition, with a main result in this case in

such as ambulation and inactivity (data not shown). the
three-way analysis of variance revealed that, as expected, the
frequency of stereotypy varied by sex, when analyzed alone,
f(1, 36) 5 10.77, p , 0.005, indicating higher frequency in females than males (table 2). also as expected, the variable
perinatal treatment, when analyzed alone, did not reach statistical significance. an absence of statistically significant variations was also seen in the three different two-way interactions and in the three-way interaction, thus suggesting that the
inhibitory effects of muscimol on stereotypy were of similar
magnitude in animals perinatally exposed to d9-thc than
controls in both sexes.
experiment iii: basal and baclofen-stimulated
[35s]-gtpgs binding
in this experiment, we used the procedure recently developed by sim et al. (27) to measure  xxxg828xxx  activa-

tion of signal transduction mechanisms. similarly to that previously reported by these authors, we have observed that the
incubation of slide-mounted brain sections in the presence of
baclofen increased [35s]-gtpgs binding over the basal binding measured in the absence of the agonist in those areas containing gabab receptors. the coincubation of baclofen with
cgp 35348, a specific antagonist, reversed this increase, supporting the involvement of  xxxg828xxx  activation.
using this procedure, we analyzed the magnitude of the
stimulation by baclofen of [35s]-gtpgs binding in the substantia nigra, globus pallidus, cerebellum, and other structures
(analyzed as controls) of adult males and females, that had
been perinatally exposed to d9-thc or oil. baclofen produced the expected increase in [35s]-gtpgs binding in the
substantia nigra [see table 3; f(1, 33) 5 5.38, p , 0.05] and in
other structures [i.e., ammon’s horn: f(1, 36) 5 9.35, p ,
0.005; dentate gyrus: f(1, 36) 5 10.45, p , 0.005; cerebral cortex: f(1, 34) 5 36.31, p , 0.00005; cerebellum: f(1, 33) 5
21.50, p , 0.0005; see table 3], but not in the globus pallidus.
the stimulation was small in most of the structures analyzed

garcia-gil et al.

(with the only exception of the cerebellum) (table 3), in concordance with the moderate presence of  xxxg828xxx 
binding. the other two variables, perinatal d9-thc treatment
and sex, analyzed alone did not exhibit any statistically significant differences for [35s]-gtpgs binding in the substantia nigra, and the same occurred in the other structures (table 3).
the different two- and three-way interactions did not in any
case reach statistical significance. a priori, this represents that
the magnitude of baclofen-stimulated [35s]-gtpgs binding
was similar in the animals of both sexes that had been perinatally exposed to d9-thc. however, it is important to point
out that the post hoc analysis revealed that the differences between baclofen-stimulated and basal [35s]-gtpgs binding
only reached statistical significance in males (% of stimulation: 16%) and females (32.4%) perinatally exposed to oil,
but not in those exposed to d9-thc (males: 6.7%; females:
4.9%) (see table 3). this did not occur in the other brain
structures analyzed (table 3), indicating certain specificity.
discussion

the present study again demonstrates that the exposure to
d9-thc during critical periods of brain development may
cause long-term changes in the functionality of certain neurotransmitters in the adulthood. most of our studies have
been focused to dopamine (1,2,7–9,24,31,32) and, more recently, to opioid peptides (3,13,29,30). the present study extends these observations to gaba, because we have seen
that the motor inhibition caused by a  xxxg828xxx  agonist, baclofen, in the open-field test was more marked in magnitude in the adult animals that had been perinatally exposed
to d9-thc. there was a receptor specificity in this observation, because no differences were seen after challenging with
muscimol, a gabaa receptor agonist. this is in concordance
with the predominant role proposed for gabab over gabaa
receptors in the relationships between gaba and cannabinoids in the basal ganglia of adult individuals (25).
these changes in the motor responsiveness to baclofen
mimicked those observed previously with dopaminergic antagonists (10), which were also different in animals perinatally
exposed to d9-thc. moreover, as occurred in that earlier
study for dopamine (10), we have seen here that the differences in the baclofen-induced motor inhibition occurred in
parallel, with no changes in the basal activity of gaba-containing neurons in the areas related to motor activity. thus,
perinatal d9-thc exposure did not produce any changes in
gad activity and gaba content in motor (caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra) and limbic (nucleus accumbens and ventral-tegmental area) structures in
adulthood. in addition, we could not demonstrate that the differences in baclofen response might be due to changes in the
magnitude of the activation by this agonist of signal transduction mechanisms, using the recently developed methodology
for the autoradiographic analysis of agonist-stimulated [35s]gtpgs binding (27). a priori, it would appear reasonable
that baclofen, as was able to produce a higher degree of motor
inhibition in d9-thc–exposed animals, should also increase
the efficiency of  xxxg828xxx  activation in an area, such
as the substantia nigra, which is a key area for the motor interactions between gabab and cannabinoid receptors (25,26).
however, our results did not confirm this initial hypothesis. in
fact, it appeared that the magnitude of baclofen stimulation of
[35s]-gtpgs binding was reduced in animals perinatally exposed to d9-thc, although this effect did not reach statistical
significance.

hence, we must relate the differences in the behavioral response of baclofen to reasons other than pharmacodynamic
changes, because we could not obtain the expected changes in
receptor activation. among these plausible reasons might be
those related to d9-thc–induced differences in the pharmacokinetic profile of baclofen or to d9-thc–induced changes
in processes located subsequently to activation of gtp binding proteins by  xxxg828xxx  agonists (i.e., kinase proteins, effector systems). however, the complexity of the extrapyramidal circuitry involved in the regulation of motor
behavior allows another explanation. the control of the activity of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons by gaba is exerted
by at least three different series of gaba containing neurons: (1) a direct inhibitory influence exerted by striatonigral
gabaergic neurons, which it is known to contain cannabinoid receptors (13); (2) a second direct inhibitory influence
coming from the pallidonigral gabaergic system, but which
is under the inhibitory control of striatopallidal gaba-containing neurons; cannabinoid receptors are located only in
these last neurons (13); and (3) a direct stimulatory influence,
exerted by glutamatergic neurons coming from the subthalamic nucleus, which are under the control of pallidosubthalamic gabaergic neurons; cannabinoid receptors are located
only in subthalamonigral glutamatergic neurons [for review,
see (26)]. then, it might be possible that the differences in the
action of baclofen, producing a higher motor inhibition, but
accompanied by an apparently lesser stimulation of [35s]-gtpgs
binding in the substantia nigra, both in d9-thc–exposed animals, might be the result of multiple interactions among these
different inputs. for instance, if we accept that the activation
of gabab receptors might be less efficient in the substantia
nigra of d9-thc–exposed animals, it would be possible to expect that the same effect might be occurring in the gabab
receptor synapses in other nuclei, such as the globus pallidus
(stimulation was very poor in this nucleus, however) or the
subthalamic nucleus. if this were true, the effect of systemic
administrations of baclofen on motor activity might result in a
more pronounced effect rather than the expected loss of effect. this is because we can suspect both: (a) an activation of
pallidonigral gabaergic neurons, resulting in a higher neuronal
inhibition in the substantia nigra, and (b) a loss of stimulatory
inputs coming from the subthalamic nucleus due to increased
activity in pallidosubthalamic gaba-containing neurons.
both facts would be concordant with a more pronounced motor inhibition, as observed in d9-thc–exposed animals. at
any rate, further research would be required to validate this
hypothesis.
collectively, the present results indicate that perinatal d9thc, although it did not produce any changes in gaba content and gad activity in limbic and motor areas in adulthood,
did increase the behavioral response to  xxxg828xxx  agonists. however, this increase was not due to changes in
 xxxg828xxx  activation of signal transduction mechanisms, as revealed by analysis of the percentage of stimulation
by baclofen of [35s]-gtpgs binding in the substantia nigra
and other structures of males and females perinatally exposed
to d9-thc.
