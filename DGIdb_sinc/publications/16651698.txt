abstract: multiple exposure to theophylline, a phosphodiesterase (pde) inhibitor, induces
acinar hypertrophy in the salivary gland. this study examined the effect of theophylline on
the gene expression of secretory proteins and phosphodiesterases in the submaxillary
gland. male f344 rats received saline or theophylline (50 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 4
days. the gene expressions for the secretory protein, cystatin s (cyss), and pde
subfamilies 3a and 4d in the submaxillary gland were quantified using rt-pcr.
theophylline exposure resulted in a sustained increase in mrna expression for cyss and
 xxxg1695xxx , but  xxxg1700xxx  gene expression was unchanged. our results suggest that
submaxillary hypertrophy is primarily caused by the enhanced transcription of cyss, and
that the transcription of each pde subfamily gene is regulated differently.

theophylline (1,3-dimethylxyanthine) is a non-specific phosphodiesterase (pde) inhibitor commonly used
for the treatment of bronchial asthma. since pde enzymes hydrolyze  xxxd1773xxx , theophylline enhances
the  xxxd1773xxx  signal by inhibiting this hydrolysis.
 xxxd1773xxx  works as an intracellular second messenger and provides the signal for smooth muscle relaxation
in the bronchial airways. therapeutic doses of theophylline range from 400 to 600 mg/day.
repeated administration of toxic doses of theophylline evokes submaxillary gland hypertrophy
characterized by an increased number of secretory
vesicles in the acinar epithelial cells [5, 13]. in the
field of toxicology, it has been reported that repeated
administration of pde inhibitors produces salivary gland

hypertrophy [6, 14], but the mechanism behind this has
not been fully elucidated.
as  xxxd1773xxx  is a transcription factor, the submaxillary hypertrophy caused by pde inhibitors is believed
to be accompanied by increased mrna expression.
among the genes which have transcription regulated
by  xxxd1773xxx , therefore, interest has focused on the
representative secretory protein, cystatin s (cyss), as
well as phosphodiesterases 3a ( xxxg1695xxx ) and 4d
( xxxg1700xxx ). cystatins are naturally occurring cysteine
proteinase inhibitors and are present in a variety of
tissues and body fluids. salivary gland-specific cyss
plays a major role in protecting the mouth against bacteria and viruses [1, 10, 11]. among the pde gene
families,  xxxg1695xxx  and  xxxg1700xxx  are the dominant sub-

families expressed in the rat salivary glands [2–4, 7–9].
in this study, we investigated the relationship between histological change and gene expression in the
submaxillary gland following exposure to theophylline.
all experimental procedures were approved by the
astellas institutional animal care and use committee
and were performed in compliance with the laws regarding humane treatment of laboratory animals. prior
to treatment, 6-week-old male f344/ducrlcrlj rats
(charles river, atsugi, kanagawa, japan) were acclimated for 1 week, and then randomly assigned to dosage
groups. all the animals were housed in groups of two
or three in mesh-bottomed stainless steel cages, with
free access to food (crf-1, oriental yeast, itabashi,
tokyo, japan) and tap water. the animal room was
maintained at 23 ± 3°c with 55 ± 5% relative humidity
and a 13-h light/11-h dark cycle.
theophylline (wako pure chemical, osaka, japan)
was dissolved in saline (5 mg/ml). animals were administered a 50 mg/kg dose of theophylline or vehicle
intraperitoneally twice a day for 4 days. five animals
were sacrificed by exsanguination under ether anesthesia just before the final administration (0 h), and 4 h
after the final administration (4 h), and their submaxillary glands were removed. one gland was immediately
fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin and a hematoxylin and eosin stained slide was prepared by
conventional methods. total rna was prepared from
the other gland using an rneasy mini kit (qiagen,
valencia, ca, usa). only a small amount of degradation was detected when measured using an agilent 2100
bioanalyzer (rna 6000 nano labchip kit, agilent
technologies, waldbronn, germany). for reverse transcription, 1 µg rna was transcribed into cdna using
random hexamer primers and superscript™ ii reverse
transcriptase (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa). each
real-time pcr reaction contained sybr green pcr
master mix (applied biosystems, foster city, ca,
usa) and 40 µm of each primer (table 1) in a volume

of 10 µl, and was carried out in triplicate using an abi
prism 7900ht sequence detection system (applied
biosystems). the primers were designed using primer
express software (ver. 1.5a, applied biosystems) with
the following parameters: low tm = 60°c; high tm =
64°c; optimum tm = 62°c; amplicon length = 70 to
150 base pairs; primer length = 12 to 25 base pairs; and
optimum length = 20 base pairs. the pcr program
was 50°c for 2 min, then 95°c for 10 min, followed by
45 cycles of 95°c for 15 s and 60°c for 1 min. adjacent melting curve analyses confirmed the validity of
the primers. no pcr amplification was observed in
the control reaction (no reverse transcriptase or cdna
template). a standard amplification curve was generated for each gene. the threshold cycle (ct) was
calculated from the rate of change of the slope of the
curve. the ct values were converted to relative expression levels for individual animals. results were
normalized to the  xxxg53xxx  gene to standardize for sample
variation since it has been shown that the expression of
 xxxg53xxx  is not modulated by  xxxd1773xxx  [2].
all statistical analyses were conducted using sas
software (ver. 8.2). gene expression data were analyzed using student’s t test to compare the relative
expression ratios to the time-matched control. analyses were considered to be statistically significant at
p<0.05.
in accordance with our previous findings, administration of theophylline for 4 days caused a pronounced
accumulation of secretory vesicles at 0 h in the submaxillary gland (fig. 1a and 1b). by 4 h after the
final administration, the secretory vesicles had been expelled and the size of the acini had become considerably
smaller along with an increase in basophilic basal area
(fig. 1c).
theophylline exposure resulted in a continuous increase in the expression of the cyss and  xxxg1695xxx  genes.
the expression level of the cyss genes in the theophylline-treated submaxillary gland was 560-fold higher

than that in the control at 0 h. at 4 h, the cyss gene
expression in the treated group was 860-fold higher
than that in the control (fig. 2a). for  xxxg1695xxx , gene
expression in the treated submaxillary gland was 1.8fold higher than that in the control at 0 h. at 4 h the
expression in the treated group was 1.9-fold higher than
that in the control (fig. 2b). in contrast,  xxxg1700xxx  gene
expression was not altered following exposure to theophylline (fig. 2c).
the results of this study show that the repeated administration of theophylline produces sustained
increases in cyss and  xxxg1695xxx  mrna expression in the
submaxillary gland. the cyss gene promoter is known
to have an element that responds to  xxxd1773xxx . in
fact, another  xxxd1773xxx  signal inducer, the beta-adrenergic agonist  xxxd2401xxx , induced rat cyss mrna
expression in the submaxillary gland, and the induction
was sustained, even 72 h after a single administration
of  xxxd2401xxx  [10]. although data on cyss mrna
levels after a single administration of theophylline are
not available, repeated stimulation of  xxxd1773xxx  signals by theophylline is likely to be attributable to the
persistent enhancement of the transcription of cyss.
moreover, the activated transcription status is thought
to lead to the marked accumulation of secretory vesicles
in the submaxillary acini. at 4 h, when the number of
secretory vesicles in the submaxillary gland had been
reduced, the expression level of cyss mrna was higher
than the level at 0 h. these results suggest that theophylline induces transient stimulation of  xxxd1773xxx 
signaling, which then induces the expulsion of the secretory vesicles and the enhancement of secretory protein
synthesis in the submaxillary gland. this hypothesis is
supported by the histopathology at 4 h, which showed
an increased basophilic basal area, indicating de novo
protein synthesis.
 xxxg1695xxx  and  xxxg1700xxx  are the pde families most commonly found in the submaxillary gland [8]. cyclic
amp-elevating agents are known to induce  xxxg1695xxx ,
3b, and 4d mrna expression in the rat aorta and femoral arteries [12]. our results show that repeated
administration of theophylline induces a persistent increase in  xxxg1695xxx  mrna expression in the submaxillary
gland. moreover, the expression was transiently enhanced after theophylline administration. this activated
transcription of  xxxg1695xxx  is thought to be a result of a
feedback mechanism that hydrolyzes the  xxxd1773xxx

concentration increased by theophylline. in contrast,
no changes in  xxxg1700xxx  mrna were apparent, although
transcription by the  xxxg1700xxx  promoter was stimulated
by dibutyryl- xxxd1773xxx , a lipophilic analogue of  xxxd1773xxx  [2]. the inductions of the different pde
subfamilies’ mrnas suggests the existence of isoformspecific regulatory mechanisms in the submaxillary
gland.
to summarize, our study suggests that the submaxillary gland hypertrophy seen after repeated
administration of theophylline is primarily caused by
marked and persistent activated transcription of the salivary secretory protein, cyss. the results also suggest
that the transcription of each pde subfamily is regulated differently in the submaxillary gland.
