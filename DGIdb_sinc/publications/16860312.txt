abstract
inflammatory reactions play an important role in ischemia/reperfusion injury in various organs. since histamine is closely related to
inflammatory reactions and immune responses, effects of postischemic administration of histaminergic ligands on ischemia-induced liver injury
were examined in rats. animals were subjected to warm ischemia for 30 min by occlusion of the left portal vein and hepatic artery under halothane
anesthesia, and liver damage was evaluated by assessing plasma concentrations of transaminases after 24 h. warm ischemia for 30 min provoked
severe liver damage after 24 h, and the plasma concentrations of  xxxg941xxx  (alt) and aspartate transaminase (ast) were 8600 i.u./l and
13100 i.u./l, respectively. subcutaneous injections of histamine twice, immediately and 6 h after reperfusion (20 mg/kg, each), alleviated liver
damage. the plasma concentrations of alt and ast in the histamine group were 35% and 24% of those in the control group, respectively.
neither  xxxd3050xxx  (3 mg/kg × 2), an h1 antagonist, nor cimetidine (15 mg/kg × 2), an h2 antagonist, affected the outcome in histamine-treated
rats. however, thioperamide (5 mg/kg × 2), an h3/h4 antagonist, completely abolished the alleviation caused by histamine. administration of
dimaprit (1–10 mg/kg × 2), an h2/h4 agonist, mimicked the protective effect of histamine, and the effect of dimaprit is reversed by
thioperamide, whereas neither h1 nor h2 antagonists altered the outcome caused by dimaprit. clozapine (15 mg/kg × 2), an h4 agonist, also
mimicked the protective effect of histamine. these findings indicate that stimulation of histamine h4 receptors after ischemic events prevents
development of reperfusion injury in the liver.

1. introduction
in clinical situations, the pathogenesis of fulminant hepatic
failure after circulatory arrest or major surgery is associated
with ischemia/reperfusion injury. although the principal
therapy against ischemia-induced organ injury is the early
restoration of blood flow, there are many factors in tissue
damage during reperfusion, such as formation of oxygen free
radicals, inflammatory cell infiltration, and intracellular ca2+
overload. particularly, activation of cytotoxic immune
responses provoked by structural alterations during ischemia
is a crucial factor in reperfusion injury, and anti-immune agents,
such as  xxxd1781xxx  and tacrolimus, have been reported to

alleviate ischemia-induced liver damage (kawano et al., 1989;
sakr et al., 1990). reperfusion injury also involves survival of
allografts in liver transplantation, because the liver is exposed to
ischemia during the organ harvest.
histamine  xxxg1079xxx  stimulation depresses immunoreactivity by reducing chemotactic responsiveness of inflammatory
cells, whereas histamine h1 action provokes anaphylactic
reactions and bronchial asthma (dy and schneider, 2004;
hirasawa et al., 1987; packard and khan, 2003). histamine h4
receptors also mediate immune responses and inflammatory cell
recruitment. chemotaxis of mast cells and eosinophils by
histamine h4 action has been demonstrated in in vitro studies
(ling et al., 2004; hofstra et al., 2003). in contrast, histamine
h4 action suppresses production of interleukin (il)-12, which is
a key inducer of cell-mediated immunity (gutzmer et al., 2005;
hilkens et al., 1997). since ischemia-induced damage may be

ameliorated by suppression of inflammatory reactions during
the reperfusion phase, we investigated the effects of histaminergic ligands on ischemia/reperfusion liver injury in rats.
2. materials and methods
2.1. animals
this study was approved by the committee on animal
experimentation at ehime university graduate school of
medicine, ehime, japan. all animals were cared for in compliance
with the principles of laboratory animal care formulated by
ehime university graduate school of medicine. male wistar rats,
weighing about 300 g each, were obtained from charles river
laboratories (yokohama, japan). the animals were housed in a
temperature-controlled room at 23 ± 1 °c. food and water were
provided ad libitum. in experiment 1, 30 rats were used for the
evaluation of histamine on ischemia/reperfusion liver injury by
assessing the plasma concentrations of liver enzymes. in
experiment 2, effects of histamine antagonists were examined in
24 rats treated with histamine. in experiment 3, effects of dimaprit,
an h2/h4 agonist, were evaluated in 31 rats. in experiment 4,
effects of histamine antagonists were examined in 47 rats treated
with dimaprit. in experiment 5, effects of clozapine, an h4 agonist,
were examined in 12 rats. in experiment 6, effects of histamine on
ischemia-induced liver necrosis were evaluated in 22 rats used in
experiment 1.
2.2. surgery for liver ischemia

(1.5 mg/kg)-injected group (n = 8), histamine (5 mg/kg)-injected
group (n = 8), and histamine (20 mg/kg)-injected group (n = 8).
after surgery for liver ischemia for 30 min at normothermia,
saline or histamine (1.5, 5, or 20 mg/kg) was subcutaneously
injected immediately after reperfusion of blood flow. administration of saline or histamine was repeated 6 h after reperfusion.
twenty-four hours after reperfusion, blood samples were
collected from the left ventricle after intraperitoneal administration of sodium pentobarbital. the plasma concentrations of alt
and ast were determined by routine laboratory procedures.
2.4. experiment 2: effects of antagonists on histamine
in experiment 2, effects of  xxxd3050xxx , an h1 antagonist,
cimetidine, an h2 antagonist, and thioperamide, an h3/h4 antagonist were examined in histamine (20 mg/kg)-treated rats.
twenty-four rats were allocated to one of the four groups (n = 6 in
each); saline,  xxxd3050xxx , cimetidine, and thioperamide groups.
after liver ischemia for 30 min, saline,  xxxd3050xxx  (3 mg/kg),
cimetidine (15 mg/kg), or thioperamide (5 mg/kg) was injected
subcutaneously. then, all animals were injected with histamine
(20 mg/kg). administration of each corresponding antagonist and
histamine was repeated after 6 h. the plasma concentrations of
alt and ast were determined 24 h after reperfusion.
2.5. experiment 3: effects of dimaprit
in experiment 3, dose-dependent effects of dimaprit, an h2/
h4 agonist, were evaluated. thirty-one rats were allocated to one

anesthesia was induced by inhalation with 2% halothane in
oxygen and nitrous oxide (50:50). after induction, the halothane
concentration was reduced to 1–1.5% for surgical preparation.
following an abdominal incision along the anterior transverse line,
the left portal vein was exposed. a thermocouple probe was
inserted into the rectum to maintain the rectal temperature at
37.5 °c with a heating lamp. heparin (100 i.u.) was injected
subcutaneously. then, the left portal vein and hepatic artery were
clamped with a temporary vascular clip. this method produces
ischemic infarcts in most liver lobes, except for the two right lateral
lobes (kawano et al., 1989). after ischemia for 30 min at 37.5 °c
under anesthesia, the clip was removed, and the surgical incision
was sutured. the rectal temperature was maintained until the
animal was allowed to recover from anesthesia. then, the animal
was brought to its cage in a room maintained at constant
temperature, and allowed access to food and water ad libitum. this
warm ischemia markedly increases the plasma concentrations of
 xxxg941xxx  (alt) and aspartate transaminase (ast) 24 h
after reperfusion, while the values in sham-operated animals are 34
± 12 and 37 ± 15 i.u./l (mean± s.d., n = 6), respectively (adachi et
al., 2000).
2.3. experiment 1: effects of histamine
in experiment 1, dose-dependent effects of histamine on liver
injury were examined. thirty rats were allocated to one of the
four groups; saline-injected control group (n = 6), histamine

thioperamide groups. the plasma concentrations of alt and
ast were determined 24 h after reperfusion.
2.7. experiment 5: effects of clozapine
in experiment 5, effects of clozapine, an h4 agonist, were
evaluated. twelve rats were allocated to one of the two groups
(n = 6 in each); vehicle-injected control group and clozapine
group. after liver ischemia for 30 min, 0.5% polysorbate 80
(vehicle) or clozapine (15 mg/kg, each) was subcutaneously
injected twice, immediately and 6 h after reperfusion. then, the
plasma concentrations of alt and ast were determined 24 h
after reperfusion.

in experiment 6, effects of histamine on liver necrosis were
examined in 22 rats subjected to transient ischemia in
experiment 1. at the end of experiment 1, the liver was
perfused with saline. then, the median lobe of the liver was
removed and preserved at − 80 °c. after resuming the
temperature to − 15 °c over 3 h, the lobe was cut into 5-mm
slices. the slices were incubated for 20 min with 1% 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (ph
7.4) at 37 °c. as 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride reacts with

group (n = 9), and dimaprit (10 mg/kg)-injected group (n = 9).
after liver ischemia for 30 min, saline or dimaprit (1, 3, or
10 mg/kg, each) was subcutaneously injected twice, immediately and 6 h after reperfusion. then, the plasma
concentrations of alt and ast were determined 24 h after
reperfusion.
2.6. experiment 4: effects of antagonists on dimaprit
in experiment 4, effects of  xxxd3050xxx ,  xxxd2082xxx ,
ranitidine and thioperamide, were examined in dimaprit
(3 mg/kg)-treated rats. forty-seven rats were allocated to one
of the seven groups; saline group (n = 6),  xxxd3050xxx  (3 mg/kg)
group (n = 7),  xxxd2082xxx  (5 mg/kg) group (n = 8),  xxxd2082xxx

(n = 8), thioperamide (5 mg/kg × 2) group (n = 6), and thioperamide (15 mg/kg × 2) group (n = 6). after liver ischemia for
30 min, saline,  xxxd3050xxx  (3 mg/kg),  xxxd2082xxx  (5 mg/kg),
ranitidine (10 mg/kg), or thioperamide (5 or 15 mg/kg) was
injected subcutaneously. then, all animals were injected with
dimaprit twice (3 mg/kg, each), immediately and 6 h after
reperfusion. administration of each corresponding antagonist
was repeated after 6 h in one  xxxd2082xxx  group and the two

severe liver damage based on enzyme levels was found in

increased markedly 24 h after liver ischemia, values being

values of alt and ast were 39% and 21% of those in the

macroscopic observation with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride stain revealed morphological damage in liver sections
24 h after 30 min of warm ischemia (fig. 6). most sections
obtained from saline-injected control animals showed necrosis
and atrophy. postischemic administration of histamine (20 mg/
kg × 2) markedly ameliorated liver injury, and the necrotic area
decreased to 14% of that in the control group (fig. 7). the
morphological lesion was consistent with liver damage assessed
by the plasma concentrations of transaminases.

with histamine (20 mg/kg × 2) were 35% and 24% of those in
control animals, respectively.
3.2. experiment 2: effects of antagonists on histamine
administration of  xxxd3050xxx , an h1 antagonist, did not
affect the protective effect of histamine (fig. 2). the values of
alt and ast in the  xxxd3050xxx  plus histamine group were
similar to those in the saline plus histamine group. likewise,
cimetidine, an h2 antagonist, did not affect the protective effect
of histamine. thioperamide, an h3/h4 antagonist, completely
abolished the beneficial effect of histamine. the values of liver
enzymes in the thioperamide group were similar to those in
liver-injured animals with no treatments.
3.3. experiment 3: effects of dimaprit
the plasma concentrations of alt and ast increased in
saline-injected control animals, although extents of increases
were slightly less than those in experiment 1 (fig. 3).
postischemic administration of dimaprit, an h2/h4 agonist,
improved ischemia-induced liver injury, and the protective
effect of dimaprit was similar to that of histamine. the values of
alt and ast in the dimaprit (10 mg/kg × 2) group were 31%
and 23% of those in the control group, respectively.
3.4. experiment 4: effects of antagonists on dimaprit
administration of  xxxd3050xxx  did not exert an influence on
the beneficial effect of dimaprit (fig. 4). although we examined
two kinds of h2 antagonists ( xxxd2082xxx  and ranitidine), neither of
them showed any effects on the alleviation caused by dimaprit.
further, the additional injection of  xxxd2082xxx  after 6 h did not
alter the effect of dimaprit. however, thioperamide reversed the
decrease in the alt value caused by dimaprit, although the effect
of thioperamide on the ast value was not significant.
3.5. experiment 5: effects of clozapine
administration of clozapine (15 mg/kg × 2), an h4 agonist,
mimicked the protective effect of histamine or dimaprit, and the

in the present study, ischemia-induced liver damage was
prevented by postischemic treatments with either histamine or
dimaprit. these protective effects were completely abolished by
thioperamide, an h3/h4 antagonist, whereas histamine h2
antagonists failed to antagonize the effects. clozapine, an h4
agonist, mimicked the action of histamine and prevented development of reperfusion injury. these findings clearly indicate that
histamine h4 action prevents development of ischemia/reperfusion liver injury.
the histamine  xxxg1081xxx  has been recently revealed in
humans, mice, rats, and guinea pigs (liu et al., 2001; morse et
al., 2001; nguyen et al., 2001; oda et al., 2000; zhu et al., 2001).
although its closest subtype is the  xxxg1080xxx , the
expression of histamine h4 receptors is different from that of
histamine h3 receptors. while histamine h3 receptors are found
mainly in the brain, histamine h4 receptors are primarily
expressed on peripheral tissues, particularly, the hematopoietic
lineage, such as bone marrow, spleen, thymus, and leukocytes
(liu et al., 2001; morse et al., 2001; oda et al., 2000; zhu et al.,
2001). considering the difference in localization between h3
and h4 receptors, it is likely that thioperamide abolished the
beneficial effect of histamine by blocking histamine h4
receptors on peripheral tissues.
naive cd4+ t cells differentiate into either t helper type 1
(th1) cells or t helper type 2 (th2) cells, both of which play
important roles in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases and
allergy. th1 cells produce interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factoralpha, which promote cell-mediated immunity, while th2 cells
concern humoral immunity (mosmann and sad, 1996). dendritic
cells, potent antigen-presenting cells, primarily mediate the
polarization of naive t cells, and histamine h4 receptors are
demonstrated at significant levels in dendritic cells (morse et al.,
2001; oda et al., 2000; zhu et al., 2001). since histamine h4
receptor stimulation has been shown to block production of il-12,
a potent th1-driving monokine, histamine h4 agonists may
suppress cell-mediated immune responses (gutzmer et al., 2005;
hofstra et al., 2003). histamine  xxxg1079xxx  stimulation increases
il-10 production and reduces il-12 secretion, resulting in a
decrease in the th1/th2 balance (elenkov et al., 1998). although
either histamine h2 or h4 action suppresses il-12 production,

186

n. adachi et al. / european journal of pharmacology 544 (2006) 181–187

histamine h4 action alone provided beneficial effects in the
present experimental model.
there is a study in which effects of ranitidine and  xxxd2082xxx 
were evaluated using an animal model of hepatic ischemia
(okajima et al., 2002). in the study, rats were subjected to 60 min
of ischemia followed by reperfusion. the increases in transaminase levels observed 12 h after reperfusion were inhibited by
ranitidine (30 mg/kg) injected 30 min before reperfusion, whereas
 xxxd2082xxx  (5 mg/kg) enhanced the increases in transaminase
levels. since these contradictory effects cannot be explained by
blockade of histamine h2 receptors, non-specific mechanisms
different from histamine h2 blockade are conceivable. histamine
h2 action does not seem to play an important role in the protection
against reperfusion injury as shown in our present experiments.
in an animal study, in which alcohol-induced liver injury was
employed, daily administration of ethanol caused histologic
changes in hepatocytes and increased the alt and ast levels
(hornyak et al., 2003). the values were twice as much as the
control values, and daily treatments with histamine normalized
the increases in the enzyme levels despite administration of
ethanol. since the protective effect of histamine had been
antagonized by ranitidine, histamine h2 receptors were suggested
to mediate the improvement in their study. in the present study,
however, histamine h2 antagonists did not reverse amelioration
caused by histamine. the alt and ast values in animals
subjected to ischemia were 8600 i.u./l and 13100 i.u./l,
respectively, while those in animals given ethanol were about
70 i.u./l and 200 i.u./l, respectively. since the magnitude of liver
damage is rather different between the two animal models, the
mechanism underlying the damage may be different between
ischemia and ethanol.
protective effects of histamine h2 action have been reported in
another animal model of liver injury (yokoyama et al., 2004). in
the study, lipopolysaccharide challenge after priming with propionibacterium acnes increased activity of  xxxg1040xxx , a histamine-generating enzyme, in cd68-positive kupffer
cells/macrophages, and blockade of histamine h2 receptors
aggravated liver injury and the mortality rate. the protective
effect of histamine may be associated with suppression of il-12,
il-18, and  xxxg2296xxx , since the increases in plasma
concentrations of these cytokines were facilitated by  xxxd2082xxx .
protective effects by histamine h2 action were also shown in
experiments, in which  xxxg1040xxx  knockout or
histamine  xxxg1079xxx  knockout mice were employed (yokoyama
et al., 2004). although differences in the pathophysiologic
mechanism between these hepatitis and ischemia are unclear,
histamine h4 action may be a primary factor in the improvement
in ischemia/reperfusion liver injury.
within known histamine h2 agonists, 4-methylhistamine and
impromidine possess h4 activity as well as dimaprit, while
amthamine and amselamine do not show histamine h4 activity at
concentrations up to 10 mum (lim et al., 2005). hence, 4methylhistamine and impromidine might show protective effects
against ischemia. although most h2 antagonists, including
cimetidine,  xxxd2082xxx , and ranitidine, do not bind to histamine
h4 receptors, burimamide possesses a high affinity for histamine
h4 receptors. clozapine binds with moderate potency to

histamine h4 receptors and exerts full agonistic activity. further,
n-desmethylclozapine, a metabolite of clozapine, shows a slightly
decreased affinity for histamine h4 receptors. considering
histamine h4 agonistic action of these histaminergic ligands,
there seem to be several compounds besides dimaprit or clozapine
that ameliorate ischemia-induced liver injury. on the other hand,
histamine h4 antagonists are supposed to treat allergic diseases,
such as atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis, because histamine
h4 receptors mediate chemotaxis of mast cells and eosinophils,
both of which are effector cells in allergic reactions (fung-leung
et al., 2004; thurmond et al., 2004). thus, the intervention
targeting histamine h4 receptors by either h4 agonists or
antagonists has therapeutic potential.
in clinical liver transplantation, the liver is often injured as a
result of ischemia during the organ harvest. although several
methods, such as hypothermia and preservation solutions, are
employed to preserve the liver after harvest, it is impossible to
apply these methods after grafting. since treatments with h4
agonists prevent development of reperfusion injury even after
ischemic events, the therapy with histaminergic ligands may be a
new strategy for liver protection after ischemia or transplantation.
