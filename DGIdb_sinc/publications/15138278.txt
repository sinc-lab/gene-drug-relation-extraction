breast cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death
and morbidity for women in the united states (1, 2). although
advances in early detection and treatment have led to a decline
in mortality, the survival rate for patients with advanced-stage
breast cancer is still low (1). consequently, there is still a great
need to identify and validate new molecular targets for antitumor therapy. this study focuses on mammary carcinoma,
where  xxxg765xxx  (fas)1 has attracted considerable
attention as a potential drug target. much of the interest in
fas stems from the fact that the enzyme is up-regulated in
about 50% of breast cancers and is an indicator of poor prognosis (3–7).
fas is the enzyme responsible for cellular synthesis of
palmitate, the precursor of long-chain nonessential  xxxd2154xxx 
(8 –11). fas, which contains seven separate enzymatic pockets,
is situated as a head-to-tail dimer with the ketoacyl synthase
and malonyl/acetyl transferase domains of one monomer work* this work was supported by cancer center support grant

ing together with the dehydratase, enoyl reductase, ketoacyl
reductase, acyl carrier protein, and thioesterase domains on
the adjacent monomer (8 –11). these enzymatic domains act
sequentially to condense acetyl-coa with malonyl-coa to form
a four-carbon intermediate. six additional turns of the cycle of
the enzyme convert this intermediate to palmitate, which is
then liberated from fas by the action of the thioesterase domain (12).
because fas functions as a head-to-tail dimer, targeted inhibition of one of the enzymatic domains of fas can ablate the
activity of one or both fas subunits (10, 11).  xxxd463xxx , a
natural product, is an antagonist of the ketoacyl synthase
domain (the condensing enzyme) of fas and functions by covalently modifying the active site cysteine, resulting in deadend inhibition (13). c75, a synthetic analog of  xxxd463xxx , also
targets the condensing enzyme and inhibits fatty acid synthesis (14). the inhibition of fas by either  xxxd463xxx  or c75 can
suppress tumor cell proliferation and, in some cases, can induce
tumor cell apoptosis (14 –20). these observations support the
contention that fas is a relevant drug target in oncology.
however, both  xxxd463xxx  and c75 are now known to have other
molecular targets (21–23), so searches for additional antagonists of fas with better selectivity and distinct mechanisms of
action are certainly warranted.
we recently reported (24) that orlistat, a drug approved for
treating obesity, is a rather potent and selective inhibitor of
fas in prostate carcinoma cells. the drug elicits its effects by
inhibiting the thioesterase domain of fas, which is responsible
for releasing palmitate from the acyl carrier protein of the
enzyme. by virtue of this activity, orlistat slowed the growth of
xenograft tumors of pc-3 prostate carcinoma cells in mice (24).
the objective of the present study was two-fold. first, we
sought to use an independent strategy to confirm that the
antiproliferative effects of orlistat result from inhibition of
fas. second, we sought to elucidate the mechanism by which a
fas blockade interferes with tumor cell proliferation. both
orlistat and small interfering rna (sirna)-targeting fas
cause a dramatic down-regulation of skp2, a component of an
e3 ubiquitin ligase that tags  xxxg419xxx  for degradation by the
proteasome. these findings mechanistically connect two biochemical pathways being explored as drug targets in cancer,
fatty acid biosynthesis, and ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis.

in eukaryotes,  xxxg765xxx  (fas) is the enzyme
responsible for synthesis of palmitate, the precursor of
long-chain nonessential  xxxd2154xxx . fas is up-regulated
in a wide range of cancers and has been suggested as a
relevant drug target. here, two independent approaches
are taken toward knocking down fas and then probing
its connection to tumor cell proliferation. in one approach, orlistat, a drug approved for treating obesity, is
used as a potent inhibitor of the thioesterase function of
fas. in a separate strategy, the expression of fas is
suppressed by targeted knock-down with small interfering rna. in both circumstances, the ablation of fas
activity causes a dramatic down-regulation of skp2, a
component of the e3 ubiquitin ligase that controls the
turnover of  xxxg419xxx . these effects ultimately tie into the
retinoblastoma protein pathway and lead to a cell-cycle
arrest at the g1/s boundary. altogether, the findings of
the study reveal unappreciated links between fatty acid
synthase and ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of cellcycle regulatory proteins.

fig. 1. serine hydrolase profile of mammary carcinoma cells.
cell lysates were generated from three breast cancer cell lines (mdamb-435, mda-mb-231, and mcf7). lysates were labeled with fppeg-tamra to tag active serine hydrolases (lanes marked with ⫺).
nonspecific labeling with the probe was measured in samples that were
boiled prior to the addition of fp-peg-tamra (lanes marked with ⫹).
labeled  xxxd2154xxx  were quantified by scintillation counting. the identity of the labeled fatty acid was verified by comparison to a palmitate
standard on thin layer chromatography. briefly, lipid extracts from
orlistat and vehicle-treated lysates of mda-mb-435 cells were resuspended in 40 ␮l of chloroform, spotted on silica gel (em science), and
chromatographed in hexane/ xxxd2052xxx /acetic acid (45:5:1). tritiated
palmitate (perkinelmer life sciences) and cold palmitate (sigma) were
used as standards. chromatographed lipids were detected by exposing
the plate in iodine vapor and on biomax film (kodak).
cell proliferation assays—cells were plated at 6.25 ⫻ 104/cm2 in
96-well plates for 24 h. cells were washed with pbs and incubated in
serum-free rpmi 1640 medium for 24 h prior to the addition of
orlistat (0 –100 ␮m). cell proliferation was measured 72 h later using
the cell proliferation brdu elisa kit (roche) according to the manufacturer’s directions.
cell synchronization and cell-cycle analysis—tumor cells were
plated at 6.25 ⫻ 104/cm2 in 6-well plates for 24 h, washed with pbs, and
serum-starved for an additional 24 h. m phase synchronization was
achieved by treating cells with 100 nm  xxxd2745xxx  (sigma) for 16 h.
synchronized cells were treated with orlistat (0 –50 ␮m) immediately
after release from the block and harvested at various times over 24 h.
cells were collected by trypsinization, rinsed in cold pbs, fixed in 70%
ethanol, and stored at ⫺20 °c. cellular dna was stained by the addition of pbs containing 200 units/ml of rnase (roche) and 18 ␮g/ml of
 xxxd3027xxx  (molecular probes, eugene, or). fluorescence was
monitored on 15,000 cells per sample using a bd facsort tabletop
cytometer (bd biosciences). data were analyzed with modfit lt software (verity software house, topsham, me).
western blot analysis—cells were synchronized with  xxxd2745xxx ,
treated with orlistat (0 –50 ␮m), harvested by trypsinization, and
rinsed with pbs. pellets were lysed in 2⫻ sds sample buffer, passed 20
times through an 18-gauge needle, boiled for 5 min, and stored at
⫺80 °c. insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (14,000 rpm)
for 10 min at 4 °c, and protein was separated by sds-page. after
electrophoresis, protein was transferred onto nitrocellulose and probed

profiling serine hydrolase activity in mammary epithelial cells—
cultured cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline
(pbs), harvested with a cell scraper, and collected by centrifugation.
cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mm tris-hcl (ph 8.0) and lysed by
sonication as described previously (25, 26). the soluble and insoluble
cell fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation at 64,000 rpm for
1 h at 4 °c. protein concentrations were determined by using the bca
assay kit from pierce. the resulting extracts were diluted in lysis buffer
to yield a 1 mg/ml final protein concentration.
the  xxxd3217xxx  probes fp-peg-tamra (fluorophosphonatepoly-ethyleneglycol-tetramethyl rhodamine), fp-peg-bodipy, and
fp-peg-biotin were synthesized and generously provided by activx
biosciences (la jolla, ca). serine hydrolase activity was examined by
incubating the soluble cell fractions (40 ␮l) with fp-peg-tamra (2
␮m) for 1 h at room temperature. nonspecific labeling was monitored by
denaturing samples for 10 min at 100 °c prior to labeling with fp-pegtamra. the reaction was terminated by the addition of 2⫻ laemmli
sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved by sds-10% page.
fluorescent-labeled hydrolases were visualized at 605 nm using a hitachi flatbed scanner and quantitated with image analysis (miraibio,
alameda, ca).
purification and identification of serine hydrolases by avidin-biotin
affinity chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry—serine hydrolases were identified using the fp-peg-biotin probe (26). briefly, cell
lysates were preabsorbed with avidin-agarose to reduce nonspecific
binding of proteins during purification. lysates were labeled with fppeg-biotin (5 ␮m) at room temperature for 1 h, after which proteins
were separated from unincorporated fp-peg-biotin by gel filtration on
nap 25 columns. after the addition of 0.5% sds, the eluate was boiled
for 10 min to denature proteins. samples were diluted with 50 mm tris
(ph 7.5) and 150 mm nacl and absorbed with avidin-agarose for 1 h at
room temperature. avidin-agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed 8⫻ with 50 mm tris (ph 7.5), 150 mm nacl, and 1%
tween 20. labeled proteins were eluted with 2⫻ sample buffer, resolved by sds-10% page, and detected by silver staining. specific
bands were extracted and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion and
peptide mass fingerprinting with maldi-tof using methods described
previously (27, 28).
inhibition of serine hydrolase activity with orlistat—orlistat was
extracted from xenicaltm capsules (roche applied science) by solubilizing each pill in 1 ml of ethanol. insoluble product was removed by
centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 5 min). the supernatant yielded a solution of orlistat (250 mm), which was aliquoted and stored at ⫺80 °c.
soluble cell extracts (40 ␮l) were incubated with orlistat (0 –1 ␮m) for
20 min prior to fp-peg-tamra addition. lysates were labeled with
fp-peg-tamra, and reactions were terminated and processed as described above. the final concentration of me2so or ethanol in each
reaction was 10%.
gene silencing using sirna—fas sirna sequences corresponding
to 5⬘-caa cta cgg ctt tgc caa t (nucleotides 6213– 6231), 5⬘-gca
act cac gct ccg gaa a (nucleotides 6657– 6675), 5⬘-gcc ctg
agc tgg act act t (nucleotides 6146 – 6164), and 5⬘-ggt atg cga
cgg gaa agt a (nucleotides 7515–7533) were custom designed and
pooled together by dharmacon (lafayette, co). mda-mb-435 cells
were plated at 3.125 ⫻ 104/cm2 in 6-cm plates for 24 h prior to transfection with 100 nm fas, skp2 (dharmacon smartpool m-003324 – 01)
or scrambled control (dharmacon d-001206 –13) sirna in opti-mem
medium (invitrogen) using lipofectamine 2000 reagent (invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cells were placed into
normal culture medium 6 h post-transfection and grown for an additional 42 h.
fatty acid biosynthesis—the incorporation of [14c]malonyl coa into
cellular  xxxd2154xxx  was measured according to published methods (15).
briefly, mda-mb-435 cells were harvested with a cell scraper and
centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 min and then frozen at ⫺80 °c. cell
pellets were hypotonically lysed in 20 mm tris (ph 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm edta, and insoluble material was removed by
centrifugation (14,000 rpm) for 15 min at 4 °c. lysates (380 ␮g) were
exposed to orlistat (0.1–10 ␮m) or vehicle at 25 °c for 1 h. lysates in
80-␮l volumes were added to 520 ␮l of solution containing 581 ␮m
nadph, 193 ␮m acetyl coa, and 116 mm kcl (ph 6.6). reactions were
mixed with 0.4 ␮ci [2-14c]malonyl coa (amersham biosciences) for 25
min at 37 °c. cold malonyl coa (208 ␮m) was added to reaction mixtures, which were incubated for an additional 15 min at 37 °c. reactions were terminated by the addition of chloroform:methanol (1:1). the
chloroform extracts were dried under n2 and extracted with watersaturated butanol. the butanol extract was evaporated under n2, and

(zymed laboratories, inc., south san francisco, ca). immunoreactivity was detected by using anti-mouse or anti-rabbit igg-conjugated
peroxidase and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence.
results

serine hydrolase profile of normal and neoplastic mammary epithelial cells—activity-based protein profiling was
used to visualize the profile of active serine hydrolases present
in mammary carcinoma cells. we used an activity-based probe
of serine hydrolases consisting of a  xxxd3217xxx  moiety
linked to tetramethyl rhodamine (fp-peg-tamra). the  xxxd3217xxx  warhead tags the active site serine of serine
hydrolases, forming an adduct that is stable to sds gel electrophoresis (29). activity profiles of three human breast cancer
cell lines, mcf7, mda-mb-231, and mda-mb-435, were compared (fig. 1). in each case, more than 20 active serine hydrolases were detected as fluorescent bands on the sds gel. preheating the sample to denature the enzymes in the lysate
eliminated reaction with the fp-peg-tamra probe. the identity of many of these enzymes was determined with mass
spectrometry. they included, among others, dipeptidyl peptidases 7 and 9, prolyloligopeptidase,  xxxg1763xxx -1,
and fas.
orlistat suppresses tumor cell proliferation by interfering
with g1/s progression—our previous work (24) showed that

orlistat inhibits fas in prostate carcinoma cells and that such
inhibition slows their growth in vivo. given the presence of
fas in mammary carcinoma cells (fig. 1), we conducted studies to determine whether orlistat would inhibit their proliferation. studies were conducted to determine whether orlistat
interferes with the proliferation of mammary carcinoma cells.
cells were incubated with orlistat for 72 h, and dna synthesis
was measured by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine. orlistat
inhibited proliferation of the mcf7, mda-mb-231, and mdamb-435 cell lines (fig. 2a). slight differences were observed in
the response of each cell line to orlistat. although proliferation
of the mda-mb-231 cells was completely inhibited by orlistat,
proliferation of the mda-mb-435 cells was knocked down by
70 – 80%, and proliferation of the mcf7 cells was suppressed
by ⬃50%.
to determine the effect of orlistat on cell-cycle progression,
we used synchronized cultures of mda-mb-435 cells. cells
were synchronized in the m phase using a  xxxd2745xxx  block.
after release of the block, cells were exposed to a saturating
concentration of orlistat and analyzed for the distribution of
cells in the g1 and s phases every 4 h by flow cytometry.
orlistat dramatically slowed the entry of the cells into s phase
compared with untreated cells (fig. 2b). the amplitude of the
g1 peak in orlistat-treated cells declines slowly after a period
of several hours. this decline in the g1 population results
partially from apoptosis2 and also partially because the blockade is leaky. similar results were obtained when cells were

synchronized at the g1/s border using thymidine, released
from the block, and allowed to progress through the next cell
cycle (data not shown).
orlistat and anti-fas sirna block fatty acid biosynthesis—we sought an independent means of inhibiting fas to
solidify the role of this enzyme in regulating tumor cell proliferation. therefore, we compared orlistat and sirna-targeting
fas for the ability to knock down the activity of the enzyme in
mda-mb-435 mammary carcinoma cells (fig. 3). as expected,
orlistat was without effect upon the level of fas (fig. 3a, left
panel) but did ablate the activity of the thioesterase domain as
indicated with the activity-based probe fp-peg-tamra (fig.
3a, right panel). the sirna-targeting fas reduced the level of
fas protein (fig. 3b, left panel) and thereby reduced the labeling of the enzyme with the activity-based probe (fig. 3b,
right panel). both antagonists also blocked the synthesis of
palmitate, the end product of fas, as indicated by reductions to
the incorporation of [14c]malonyl coa into  xxxd2154xxx  (fig. 3, c
and d).
an fas blockade alters the key regulatory steps in the
retinoblastoma protein pathway—we examined the effects of
a fas blockade on key regulatory steps in the retinoblastoma
protein (rb) protein pathway, a primary regulator of the g1/s
transition (30). this analysis included measures of (i) the phosphorylation status of rb, a parameter that governs the interaction of this protein with  xxxg668xxx  and subsequent entry into s
phase (30); (ii)  xxxg419xxx , which negatively regulates cyclin-dependent kinase activity (31); and (iii) skp2, a protein component of the e3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates degradation of

 xxxg419xxx  (32). the effect of a concentration range of orlistat on
each of these parameters was measured by western blotting
(fig. 4a). orlistat reduced phosphorylation of the rb protein,
up-regulated  xxxg419xxx , and down-regulated skp2. these effects
were evident at levels of the drug consistent with the cellular
ic50 of orlistat for inhibition of the fas thioesterase (⬃1–3
␮m). to independently verify that the effects of orlistat could
be attributed to its ability to block fas, similar experiments
were conducted with sirna-targeting fas (fig. 4b). like orlistat, the sirna-targeting fas decreased the phosphorylation
of rb, increased the level of  xxxg419xxx , and reduced the level of
skp2. an sirna-targeting skp2 had identical effects upon its
downstream target,  xxxg419xxx , and upon the phosphorylation status of the rb protein. together, these findings provide strong
support for the idea that a fas blockade acts upon the rb
pathway via regulation of skp2 and also indicate that a fas
blockade is likely to have effects similar to an skp2 blockade.
discussion

results from this study reinforce the idea that fas is a
relevant drug target in oncology and further support the notion
that fas is the relevant target for orlistat in tumor cells. the
inhibitory effects of orlistat on fas are rather unexpected,
because the drug has been studied for more than 15 years with
no mention of the effects upon fatty acid synthesis. the effects
of the drug on fas are likely to have been overlooked because
orlistat is administered orally but is not significantly absorbed
into the bloodstream. the drug acts in preventing absorption of
dietary fat by inhibiting  xxxg1789xxx  (another serine hy-

drolase) in the digestive tract (33, 34). the results of the present study indicate that orlistat and other ␤-lactones should be
considered to be a promising class of thioesterase antagonists
that could be exploited for antitumor therapy.
the evidence supporting the conclusion that the antiproliferative effects of orlistat are mediated by inhibition of fas is
as follows: first, our activity-based protein-profiling experiments indicate that fas is the only serine hydrolase target for
orlistat in the breast cancer cell lines. we have noted three
other bands with mr ⬃ 90 –150 kda that are also inhibited by
orlistat, but these seem to be breakdown products of fas
because they can be immunoprecipitated with anti-fas antibody and because they are knocked down with sirna-targeting
fas (see fig. 3b). second, orlistat blocks the incorporation of
[14c]malonyl coa into palmitate, a biosynthetic reaction mediated by fas. third, the effects of orlistat on tumor cell proliferation and regulation of rb,  xxxg419xxx , and skp2 all occur at
concentrations of the drug that approximate its cellular ic50
for fas (between 1 and 3 ␮m). fourth, our prior work shows
that orlistat directly inhibits the activity of the recombinant
thioesterase of fas (24). fifth, the effects of orlistat on tumor
cell proliferation and on regulation of rb and  xxxg419xxx  are mimicked by sirna-targeting fas.
the present study also provides a new insight into the mechanisms underlying the connection between fas and tumor cell
proliferation. orlistat arrests the cell cycle at the g1/s transition. this effect was noted in all breast cancer cells we tested,
along with tumor cells derived from the prostate (not shown).
these findings suggest that the block in g1/s progression is a
common mechanism mediating the antiproliferative effects of

fig. 4. inhibition of fas leads to down-regulation of skp2. a,
the effect of orlistat on rb phosphorylation and on the levels of
 xxxg419xxx  and skp2 was measured in  xxxd2745xxx -synchronized mdamb-435 cells. cells were exposed to a range of orlistat for 20 h, lysed,
and subjected to analysis by western blotting. b, the effect of sirnatargeting fas or skp2 on rb phosphorylation, and the levels of

were analyzed by western blotting.

orlistat. substantial decreases in dna synthesis have likewise
been noted in response to  xxxd463xxx  and c75, other antagonists
of fas (19).
the g1/s cell-cycle arrest elicited by a fas blockade is mediated through the rb pathway. cells treated with either orlistat or sirna-targeting fas show decreased phosphorylation
of rb and increased levels of the complex between rb and
 xxxg668xxx  (data not shown). the increased association of these two
proteins prevents the transcriptional activity of  xxxg668xxx  essential for entry into s phase. we have traced the effects of a fas
blockade upstream of rb and found such a blockade to alter the
levels of  xxxg419xxx  and skp2.  xxxg419xxx  acts as a negative regulator
of the cyclin-dependent kinases that ultimately phosphorylate
rb and, therefore,  xxxg419xxx  acts as a negative regulator of g1/s
transition (35). inhibition of fas led to increases in  xxxg419xxx 
protein levels without affecting its transcription (data not
shown), indicating a stabilization of  xxxg419xxx . interestingly, inhibition of fas also substantially reduces the levels of skp2, an
f-box protein essential for proteasome degradation of  xxxg419xxx .
like sirna-targeting fas, an sirna-targeting skp2 also increased  xxxg419xxx  levels and blocked phosphorylation of rb. consequently, we conclude that inhibition of fas acts upstream of
the proteasome to control  xxxg419xxx  levels and ultimately blocks
cell-cycle progression. the mechanistic connections between
the fas blockade by orlistat and reductions in skp2 are the
subject of current investigations.
the observations in this report are different from prior work
in which  xxxd463xxx  and c75 were employed as fas inhibitors.
these compounds block both g1/s and g2/m progression (16,
19, 36). we found no evidence that fas blockade with orlistat
affected the g2/m transition point. there are two potential
explanations for this difference in effect. one possibility is that
inhibition of the different enzymatic pockets of fas elicits
distinct downstream effects. although we cannot definitively
exclude this possibility, it is difficult to envision how antagonists of distinct enzymatic pockets, each leading to inhibition of
product formation, could elicit different effects. another possibility is that  xxxd463xxx  and c75 bind to additional molecular
targets that account for the effects upon g2/m. in this regard,
we have begun to analyze clonal variants of mda-mb-435 cells
resistant to orlistat. we have found these cells to retain sensitivity to  xxxd463xxx  (data not shown), a finding that lends
support to the idea that these two compounds have different
mechanisms of action.
it is now clear that several avenues for antitumor therapy
converge at the g1/s transition. recent work indicates that
skp2 is one of the important g1/s regulatory points because it
is necessary for ubiquitin-dependent degradation of  xxxg419xxx 
(32). consequently, skp2 is a positive regulator of cell-cycle
progression. in fact, skp2 has even been suggested as a potential drug target (37), an idea that is significantly strengthened
by the recent observation that skp2 levels are associated with
reduced survival in prostate cancer (38). the present study
shows that a fas blockade ultimately decreases skp2 levels.
therefore, fas represents an upstream leverage point for targeting skp2. identifying and understanding the mechanism
and molecular players that make this connection is an important direction for future investigation.
