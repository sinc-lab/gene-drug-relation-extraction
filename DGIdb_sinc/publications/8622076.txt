postsurgical adjuvant chemotherapy of stage ii
breast carcinoma with or without crossover to a
non-cross-resistant regimen: a cancer and
leukemia group b study
by marjorie perloff, larry norton, ann h. korzun, william c. wood, robert w. carey, arlan gottliebf,
john c. aust, arthur bank, richard t. silver, fred saleh, george p. canellos, michael c. perry, raymond b. weiss,
and james f. holland
purpose: to compare two cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, vincristine, and prednisone (cmfvp)
regimens with a doxorubicin-based regimen-vinblastine,
doxorubicin,  xxxd3358xxx , and  xxxd2136xxx  (upjohn, kalamazoo,
mi) (vath)-in patients with stage ii node-positive breast
carcinoma.
methods: nine hundred forty-five women were treated
wi
week induction course of cmfvp. they were then
randomized to receive one of two consolidation cmfvp regimens: 6-week courses or 2-week courses. following completion of cmfvp consolidation, patients were again randomized to either continue the cmfvp regimen or to receive
six escalating doses of vath.
results: among all patients, with a median follow-up
time of1 .5 years, there is no statistically significant difference in disease-free survival (dfs) between the two consolidation cmfvp regimens. vath intensification treatment is
statistically significantly superior to cmfvp in terms of dfs
(p = .0040). for patients with one to three involved nodes,
there is currently no significant difference between vath

combination

chemotherapy with cyclo-

phosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil
(cmf), administered after surgical removal of a primary
breast cancer and involved axillary lymph nodes, improves
both disease-free and overall survival for many patients.1

nevertheless, a significant proportion of patients still relapse.
some surviving cancer cells remain biochemically sensitive
to chemotherapy and can respond again when treatment is
reapplied in the stage iv setting.2 another mechanism for
therapeutic failure, and certainly the predominant mechanism
in laboratory models, is biochemical drug resistance at the
cellular level.3 therapies that effectively address these two
problems might, therefore, improve clinical results.
theoretically, the use of an increased number of active
drugs in adequate therapeutic dosages should result in
increased benefit by killing cells that are resistant to a
smaller or less dose-intensive drug combination.4 based
on original observations reported by cooper et al 5 and
bonadonna et al, 6 cancer and leukemia group b
(calgb) study 7581 suggested that the addition of vincristine and prednisone (vp) to cmf delayed relapse in
patients who had had involvement of four or more axillary
lymph nodes.7 retrospective analyses of these data, later
supported by reports from milan8 and manchester, 9 suggested that adequate dosing of cmf was needed for full

and cmfvp; however, among those with four or more positive lymph nodes, there is a significant difference in favor
of vath (p= .0037). there is also improved overall survival
with vath (p= .043; median, > 14 years v 10 years). this
difference is also statistically significant in patients with four
or more involved lymph nodes, among postmenopausal
patients, and among postmenopausal estrogen receptorpositive patients.
conclusion: chemotherapy with crossover to escalating
doses of vath following cmfvp was well tolerated and
effective. inauguration of vath as a treatment intensification at the eighth month produced a major increase in relapse-free and overall survival. the observation that sensitivity to vath is retained so long after mastectomy raises
questions about the proper duration of adjuvant chemotherapy and lends support to further investigation of crossover designs in future trials of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy regimens.

that improved delivery of a cmfvp regimen could offer
clinical advantages.

perloff et al

with stage iv breast carcinoma were treated with repeated
blocks of a 6-week cmfvp regimen that consisted of
daily oral cyclophosphamide for the full 6 weeks, oral
prednisone for the first 4 weeks, and six consecutive
weekly intravenous administrations of methotrexate, 5fluorouracil, and vincrinstine. by progressively decreasing the rest period between cycles, in sequential cohorts
of patients, it was found that such 6-week blocks could
be safely administered after a 6-week rest period. since
this dose schedule could possibly deliver more total drug
and more peak dose-intensity than the conventionally
used 2-week blocks separated by 2-week rest periods,"'
the direct comparison of both schemes seemed reasonable.
however, a more intensive dose schedule of cmfvp
would theoretically still be ineffective against a population of tumor cells resistant to all five drugs. the entirely
distinct combination of vinblastine, doxorubicin,  xxxd3358xxx ,
and  xxxd2136xxx  (upjohn, kalamazoo, mi) ( xxxd2136xxx ) (vath) had previously been shown to be effective
as a second-line regimen for patients with metastatic
2
breast carcinoma refractory to cmf or cmfvp.1 ,3 thus,
many patients appeared to have a subpopulation of tumor
cells resistant to cmfvp, but sensitive to vath. hence,
we elected to test the activity of vath as a sequenced
postoperative adjuvant treatment for patients who had
received cmfvp.

on the basis of computer simulations of a gompertzian
model of tumor growth,'4."5 we chose to treat with vath
after the initial application of a full course of cmfvp,
rather than in a cyclic alternating pattern. a full course
of cmfvp was designated to be 8 months in duration,
with reference to both the original description by cooper
et al' and to a randomized comparison reported by bonadonna6 that failed to demonstrate an advantage of 12
months of cmf over 6 months. doses of vath were
chosen to start low for 2 months, with stepwise escalation
to full levels. this was done to avoid early toxicity, to
obviate the need for dose reductions, and to keep the
cumulative dose of doxorubicin at 180 mg/m2, well below
the usual level of clinical cardiotoxicity.
the present study was thus designed to compare the
relative efficacy of two different schedules of cmfvp
chemotherapy, as well as to determine the activity of
chemotherapy in the second phase of the treatment period
with a different regimen (vath), compared with continuation of cmfvp for an equivalent duration (fig 1).
methods
patient eligibility
only women less than 76 years of age with tumors confined to
the breast or axilla (mo) were eligible for study. the tumor had to
be movable in relation to the underlying pectoral fascia and/or muscle and chest wall, not involve skin beyond the breast, or not ulcerate

the skin of the breast (ti, t2, or t3). if the axillary nodes were
palpable, they had be movable in relation to the chest wall and
neurovascular bundle (no, nla, or nlb). there could be no arm
edema. patients must have undergone a conventional or modified
radical mastectomy with removal of at least the lower axillary contents. pathologic examination had to confirm primary breast cancer
and involvement of at least one axillary lymph node. infiltration of
dermal lymphatics was acceptable in the absence of clinical manifestations of inflammatory carcinoma. biochemical  xxxg730xxx 
determinations were performed on each primary tumor. screening
to rule out distant metastatic disease was by history, physical examination, serum chemistries (alkaline phosphatase, hepatic transaminases, calcium, and bilirubin levels), chest x-ray, and radionuclide
bone scan. additionally, patients had to have a wbc count greater
than 4,000/pil, platelet count greater than 100,000/gl, blood urea
nitrogen (bun) level less than 25 mg/dl, and/or serum creatinine
concentration less than 1.5 mg/dl. voluntary informed consent and
geographic accessibility for follow-up evaluation were mandatory.
patients were ineligible if the primary surgery was inadequate.
patients with lumpectomy were not studied. prior irradiation, surgery, chemotherapy, or hormonal therapy for breast carcinoma were
criteria for exclusion, as was the presence of bilateral breast carcinomas. clinical fixation of axillary or supraclavicular nodes rendered
patients ineligible unless these sites were proven by biopsy to be
tumor-free. the only acceptable previous or concomitant cancers
were squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma-insitu of the cervix that had been curatively treated, or lobular carcinoma-in-situ found by mirror-image biopsy of the contralateral
breast at the time of mastectomy. patients could have had no history
of myocardial infarction within 6 months of randomization and no
active coronary arterial insufficiency. chemotherapy had to be initiated within 8 weeks after mastectomy.

mg) for 6 consecutive weeks, and prednisone 40 mg/m 2/d orally in
divided doses on an empty stomach immediately before meals for
21 consecutive days, which was then halved every 2 days three times
with discontinuation on the twenty-eighth day.
patients randomized to receive repeated 6-week courses of
cmfvp as consolidation entered a 6-week rest period on the fortythird day. at the end of the rest period, they resumed a 6-week
course of cmfvp identical to the first course. this was followed
by another 6-week rest period and then a third 6-week cmfvp
course.
patients randomized to receive conventional cmfvp entered a
2-week rest period following completion of the induction treatment.
they then received six monthly cycles of cmfvp. each cycle consisted of 2 weeks of treatment, followed by a 2-week rest period.
2
doses were cyclophosphamide 100 mg/m /day orally, given as described earlier, on days 1 through 14 of each 28-day cycle; methotrexate 40 mg/m2 iv on days 1 and 8 (patients > 60 years received
30 mg/m2); fluorouracil 500 mg/m 2 iv on days 1 and 8; vincristine
1 mg/m 2 iv (maximum single dose, 1.5 mg) on days 1 and 8; and
2
prednisone 40 mg/m orally on days 1 through 14 inclusive, given
as described earlier, but discontinued without tapering.
following completion of consolidation, patients were stratified according to menopausal status at the time of protocol entry and to
cmfvp schedule. they were randomized by sealed envelope to intensification with vath or cmfvp. for patients randomized to receive
vath,  xxxd2136xxx  was administered daily  xxxd1891xxx  mg orally three times
per day through the treatment, terminating 7 days after the last administration of iv drugs. the first two 28-day cycles consisted of vinblastine 1.5 mg/m2 iv, doxorubicin 15 mg/m 2 iv, and  xxxd3358xxx  4 mg/m2
iv. the third and fourth cycles were given at doses of vinblastine 3
mg/m2 iv, doxorubicin 30 mg/m2 iv, and  xxxd3358xxx  8 mg/z. the fifth
and sixth cycles were given at doses of vinblastine 4.5 mg/m2 iv,
doxorubicin 45 mg/m2, and  xxxd3358xxx  12 mg/f iv.

study design
two separate randomization events occurred for each patient: the
first randomization related to the schedule of cmfvp with an initial
6-week induction, followed by consolidation with 6 months of conventional 2-week blocks separated by 2-week rest periods, or the
initial 6-week induction followed by consolidation with two additional 6-week blocks separated by 6-week rest periods. the second
randomization, which took place at the end of the first 8 months of
cmfvp, was to continue cmfvp, following the same pattern as
used in the first consolidation, or to receive six cycles of vath as
described later. the total therapy for each patient, therefore, consisted of an induction phase (6-week cmfvp), a consolidation phase
(one of two versions of cmfvp), and an intensification phase (either
cmfvp or vath). both randomizations were by a sealed-envelope
technique using a latin square design balanced within and across
16
institutions and stratification categories.
before the first randomization, patients were stratified by menopausal status (with the postmenopausal state defined as the absence
of spontaneous menstruation for 6 months), and by nodal status (one
to three, four to nine, or - ten tumor-containing axillary nodes).
this resulted in six stratification groups for each of the two initial
treatment regimens.
induction therapy for all patients consisted of 6 weeks of cyclophosphamide 80 mg/m2 orally in divided doses on an empty stomach
immediately before meals for 42 consecutive days, methotrexate 40
mg/m 2 intravenously (iv) for 6 consecutive weeks (patients > 60
years received 30 mg/m 2/wk), fluorouracil 500 mg/m 2/wk iv for 6
consecutive weeks, vincristine 1 mg/m 2 iv (maximum single, 1.5

dose adjustments: cmfvp
cmfvp dose modifications were based on blood test results and
clinical findings on the day of chemotherapy administration. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil were given at 50% levels if the leukocyte count was between 2,500 and 3,999/ml and/or
the platelet count was between 75,000 and 99,999/pl; for lower
leukocyte or platelet counts, these drugs were withheld. vincristine
and prednisone doses were not adjusted for hematologic values.
vincristine was given at half dose if the bilirubin level was between
1.5 and 3 mg/dl and/or the ast level between 100 and 150 iu;
vincristine and methotrexate were withheld if either value was elevated beyond these limits. the methotrexate dose was reduced 50%
for a serum creatinine concentration between 1.6 and 1.9 mg/dl and
was not given if the creatinine level was > 2 mg/dl. methotrexate
and fluorouracil were withheld in the presence of stomatitis or diarrhea. the vincristine dose was halved if mild paresthesias and/or
weakness were present and withheld for more severe neurologic
symptoms. on the development of hematuria, cyclophosphamide
was discontinued and replaced with  xxxd1665xxx  2 mg for every
50 mg of cyclophosphamide. prednisone was discontinued if uncontrollable psychiatric symptoms or hyperglycemia developed.

tologic recovery, if, on the day of scheduled iv drug administration,
the leukocyte count was less than 4,000/l or platelet count less
than 100,000/pl. after the 1-week delay, if the repeat leukocyte
count was between 2,500 and 3,999/ml or the platelet count between
75,000 and 99,999/jpl, 50% of the planned doses were administered;
doses could subsequently be escalated if hematologic parameters
permitted. if the hematologic parameters did not meet these minimum limits after the 1-week delay, therapy was withheld with
weekly monitoring until such minimum values were obtained, at
which time therapy was resumed at doses of 50% of previous levels
for the duration of the study.
vinblastine, doxorubicin, and  xxxd3358xxx  were not administered until
mild stomatitis or mild diarrhea resolved, until the bilirubin level
decreased to less than 3 mg/dl, and until ast measurement decreased to less than 250 iu. in these cases, therapy was then reinstituted at 50% of the last dose given and subsequently escalated if
similar toxicities did not recur. if the toxicities recurred, treatment
was continued at the last nontoxic dose, without subsequent escalation. for moderate or severe diarrhea, stomatitis, bilirubin level
greater than 3 mg/dl, or ast greater than 250 iu, treatment was
delayed until the abnormalities resolved, and then was reinstituted
at the last nontoxic dose without provision for further escalation.
doxorubicin was discontinued if congestive heart failure or any
persistent arrhythmia developed. at the occurrence of virilization
unacceptable to the patient, the  xxxd2136xxx  dose was halved; if the
changes did not resolve in 4 weeks, the drug was omitted for 4
weeks and then reinstituted. the drug was discontinued permanently
if cholestatic jaundice developed.

treatments, dfs and overall survival were measured from the date
vath or continued cmfvp started.
differences in distributions of dfs and overall survival were
evaluated using a cox proportional hazards multivariate model"7 or,
univariately, the log-rank test and stratified log-rank test.'" differences in patient characteristics were evaluated using the x' test for
categoric variables'" or the wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous
variables. 20 dfs and overall survival curves and medians were estimated by the kaplan-meier method." all p values for survival
analysis are two-sided from the unstratified log-rank test, unless
otherwise noted. the intent-to-treat method of analysis was used,
with patients analyzed in the group to which they were randomized,
regardless of treatment received.
results
nine hundred forty-five patients were enrolled between
october 1980 and august 1984. twenty-nine (3%) were
ineligible, 12 (1%) never received treatment, and five (<
1%) had no follow-up data, which left 899 available for
analysis. of these 899 patients, 145 did not complete
consolidation (60 patients withdrew, 31 experienced excess toxicity, 16 relapsed, 10 died, and 20 had other reasons) cmfvp treatment, 40 did complete consolidation,
but were not subsequently randomized, and two had no
post-cmfvp follow-up data. thus, 712 patients (75%

of 945) are analyzed for the influence of intensification
treatment.

follow-up
repeat complete blood cell counts were obtained on the days of
drug injection. patients underwent physical examinations at least
once per month. bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and ast measurements were repeated monthly. chest x-rays and bone scans were
repeated every 6 months during active therapy. following completion of chemotherapy, patients were seen for follow-up examinations
every 4 months for 4 more years, and then annually. history and
physical examinations, as well as complete blood cell counts, liver
function tests, and chest x-rays were performed at each visit. bone
scans were repeated when clinically indicated.
relapse criteria
any definitive evidence of recurrent tumor, whether inside or
outside the cns, constituted treatment failure and necessitated patient removal from the protocol. biopsy proof of treatment failure
was obtained whenever possible.
those patients removed from the study because of relapse were
monitored for survival. patients who prematurely ceased chemotherapy for reasons other than disease recurrence were monitored on
protocol without therapy for relapse and survival.
statistical methods
for the analysis of disease-free survival (dfs), an event was
defined as a relapse or a death from any cause, measured from the
day of entry on study to the date relapse was documented, or the
date of death, if the patient died without relapse, or the date of last
contact. overall survival was measured from the day of entry on
study to the date of death (from any cause) or the data were censored
as of the date of last contact. for the comparison of intensification

the groups for comparison of consolidation and intensification regimens are similar according to all prognostic
factors measured (table 1). the overall median age was
52 years, with 41% of patients being premenopausal.
fifty-seven percent of patients had  xxxg730xxx -positive tumors. eighty-eight percent of patients had undergone modified radical mastectomies, the others, radical
mastectomies. the median number of axillary lymph
nodes examined was 18. approximately 55% of patients
had four or more involved lymph nodes. the median time
from mastectomy to start of treatment was 28 days.
the four groups for comparison of intensification regimens are as follows: (1) cmfvp in 2-week blocks, (2)
cmfvp in 2-week blocks followed by vath, (3)
cmfvp in 6-week blocks, and (4) cmfvp in 6-week
blocks followed by vath (figure 1). these groups are
comparable for all prognostic factors, except the number
of positive nodes (table 1). patients randomized to receive vath had fewer positive nodes than those who
continued on cmfvp (p = 0.049, wilcoxon test). the
influence of this imbalance is controlled for in the statistical analyses.
patient status
three hundred twenty-one patients are alive and on
study, 515 have relapsed, 457 have died, and 35 have

been lost to follow-up evaluation for study status and 18
have been lost for survival status. of 35 patients lost for
study status, 20 are known to have later died, and the
time for loss for study status to the date of death or last
known status alive ranges from 0 days to 12 years. of
18 patients lost for survival status, the year of loss was
between 1984 and 1994 (and nine were monitored
through 1993 or 1994). of 321 patients still alive and on
study, the date last known alive ranges from 1985 to
1994, and most (87%) were monitored for survival at
least through 1993.
sites of relapses
there have been 515 relapses reported among 899 patients analyzed in this report: 116 (23%) relapsed locally
(86 patients local only, plus 30 patients at local and distant
sites simultaneously). the most common single site of
relapse was bone (137 cases [27%]). thirty-one (6%)
were in the opposite breast.
dfs
among all patients, with a median follow-up duration
of 11.5 years, there is no statistically significant difference
in dfs between the two consolidation cmfvp regimens,
either overall (p = .58; median, 6.0 v 5.6 years) or in
subsets by nodal or menopausal status.
on the basis of this lack of difference between schedules of consolidation cmfvp, the data for the two consolidation regimens are pooled for the examination of the

influence of vath. there is strong evidence for the benefit of vath treatment compared with continuation of
cmfvp. of 754 eligible patients who completed cmfvp
induction and consolidation, 712 (94%) were randomized
to intensification. among all 712 patients, the two
cmfvp arms have inferior dfs times compared with
the vath arms (p = .0040; median, 5.0 v 8.7 years)
(fig 2). for patients with one to three involved nodes,
there is currently no significant difference between the
two intensification treatments (p = .51).
among patients with four or more positive axillary
nodes, vath is statistically significantly superior to
cmfvp (p = .0037; median, 3.5 v 2.3 years) (fig 3).
vath is superior to continuation of cmfvp in postmenopausal  xxxg730xxx -positive women (p <
.0038; median, 9.7 v 4.3 years) (fig 4). vath is superior
in patients with  xxxg730xxx -positive tumors (p =
.0069; median, 10.1 v 5.4 years). in a multivariate cox
model analysis, factors significant for predicting dfs included number of positive nodes (p = .0001), estrogen
receptor status (p = .024), and menopausal status (p =
.014). controlling for these factors, the dfs superiority
of vath remains statistically significant (p = .0067,
cox model).
overall survival
the median overall survival time for the entire study
was 10.7 years. four hundred fifty-seven deaths have
been reported, 44 of which were deaths without docu-

of disease at death, but died of other causes, and 20
were lost to follow-up evaluation for relapse status before
death. in a multivariate cox model analysis, factors significant for the prediction of overall survival included
number of positive nodes (p = .0001),  xxxg730xxx 
status (p = .0001), and menopausal status (p = .23).
when adjusted for these covariates, there was a trend
toward the superiority of vath (p = .078).
there is no difference in survival by consolidation
cmfvp treatment regimen (p = .81; median, 10.9 v 10.3
years). however, there is improved survival with vath
as compared with cmfvp (p = .043; median, > 14 years
v 10.0 years) (fig 5). this difference is statistically significant among patients with four or more involved lymph
nodes (p = .011; median, 9.4 v 5.4 years), among postmenopausal patients (p = .046; median, 11.8 v 8.5 years),
and among postmenopausal  xxxg730xxx -positive patients (p = .24; median, > 14 years v 9.5 years).

treated as randomized). toxicity grading was by calgb
criteria. initial and consolidation cmfvp regimens were
tolerable for almost all patients, with no unusual toxicities
(table 2). however, there were six episodes (0.7%) of
fatal toxicity during induction or consolidation. severe or
life-threatening leukopenia was somewhat more frequent
among patients who received repeated 6-week blocks of
cmfvp (36%) compared with 2-week blocks (26%). peripheral neuropathy secondary to vincristine was more
than moderate in 13% and 19% of patients on each regimen, respectively. thirty-eight percent of premenopausal
patients developed amenorrhea. virtually all patients developed some capital alopecia, but significant degrees
were reported in only 19%.
intensification was also generally well tolerated. patients who continued to receive 6-week courses of
cmfvp had significantly more severe leukopenia than
with the other three regimens (31% v 9%, 4%, and 13%).
overall, only 1% to 2% of patients who received vath
developed severe hirsutism, and only 1% cardiotoxicity.
amenorrhea remained common, occurring in 36% to 51%
of premenopausal patients.
there was one additional treatment-related death during intensification, bringing the total to seven (0.8%).

two deaths were attributed to cerebral vascular accidents,
both associated with life-threatening hyperglycemia.
there were two fatal pulmonary emboli, one fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and two episodes of pancytopenia
with fatal septic shock.
severe posttherapy problems to date are limited to 1%
of patients who developed aseptic necrosis of the femoral
head, and 1% who developed cataracts, although this may
be related to the age of the population.
discussion
two possible approaches to the problem of drug resistance in the postsurgical adjuvant setting were addressed
by this trial. the first was an attempt to deliver a higher
peak dose (milligrams per square meter over time) of
cmfvp. hryniuk et al,22 in a retrospective analysis,
found a positive correlation between dose-intensity (milligrams per square meter per week) and dfs in patients
with stage ii breast cancer. in a preliminary analysis of
the current trial, the total dose (milligrams per square
meter per regimen) of cmf received was only slightly
higher when delivered by 2-week blocks and, perhaps for

this reason, was not more therapeutically efficacious.23
additionally, the long periods without drug exposure between 6-week blocks of cmfvp did not result in worse
results. this may mean either that the major factor in
determining therapeutic impact is total dose (milligrams
per square meter per regimen), or that the major biologic
effect is accomplished during the first 6 weeks of induction therapy. henderson et al, 24 in a study with power too
low to discern a small difference, found that a 15-week
regimen of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin was as
efficacious as 30 weeks in patients with at least four
involved axillary lymph nodes. in contrast, the canadian
trial organization observed that 12 weeks of adjuvant
treatment was greatly inferior to longer treatment.2 5
hence, it is improbable that 6 weeks of cmfvp is sufficient to deliver all of this combination's therapeutic benefit. further delineation of the important relationship between dose, duration, and effect will require prospective
trials.
the second objective of this protocol was to test the
feasibility and impact of a crossover to the non-crossresistant combination of vath after 8 months of

cmfvp. a highly significant advantage in dfs was seen
for patients randomized to receive vath rather than continuing on cmfvp. this beneficial effect was accomplished without increased toxicity.
in this study, the major impact of crossover to vath
seems to be in patients with a high degree of nodal
involvement, postmenopausal status, and  xxxg730xxx -positive tumors. patients with a high degree of
nodal involvement have larger tumor burdens26 and may
have higher probabilities of antecedent mutations toward heterogeneity. 27 tumors in postmenopausal patients tend to grow more slowly, which correlates with
high  xxxg730xxx  positivity. 28 even if these biologic variables explain, in part, the benefit from crossover therapy, the impact of vath was also evident as
well in patients with  xxxg730xxx -negative tumors
and extensive nodal involvement. the data from this
trial do not exclude the possibility of a beneficial interaction between cytotoxic agents and the androgen.
however, vinblastine,  xxxd3358xxx , and doxorubicin are all
known to have therapeutic activity against metastatic
breast cancer, and there are no data that allow us to
distinguish their chemotherapeutic effect on subsets of
the population from effects of  xxxd2136xxx . we rec-

ognize that the complexity of this study design does
not allow us to identify the feature(s) of the treatment
regimens that contributed to the observed difference in
outcome.
goldie and coldman have presented a mathematic
model in which biochemical resistance to chemotherapy
develops rapidly within a hundred-fold increase in tumorcell number. 29 they conclude that delays in initiation of
therapy should be detrimental because of emergence of
resistance during unperturbed growth. this study demonstrates that the vath regimen was effective, despite being started 8 months after initiation of treatment, and at
dose levels that may have been suboptimal at onset. the
widespread concept that 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer is sufficient, since cmf for 6 months
is equivalent to 12 months of treatment,6 is shown not to
be a universal truth. inauguration of vath treatment
intensification at the eighth month produced a major increase in relapse-free and overall survival. the observation that sensitivity to vath is retained so long after
mastectomy, despite a preceding regimen of cmfvp,
lends support to the use of crossover designs in future
investigative regimens of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.
