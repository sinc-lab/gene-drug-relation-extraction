a b s t r a c t antagonism of the antihypertensive action of  xxxd2243xxx  by the tricyclic antidepressants,
desipramine and protriptyline, has been demonstrated
in controlled studies. these antidepressants also prevent the effect of the related ring-substituted guanidinium adrenergic neuron blockers,  xxxd326xxx  and
 xxxd1818xxx . that the rise in blood pressure when
desipramine is added to  xxxd2243xxx  therapy is not due
simply to a pressor action of the two drugs in combination was demonstrated by the lack of an increase in
blood pressure when  xxxd2243xxx  was added to desipramine therapy.
investigations were conducted to determine whether
antagonism of  xxxd2243xxx 's clinical effect could result
from blockade by the tricyclic antidepressants of the
norepinephrine pump in the adrenergic neuron membrane, thereby preventing the uptake of  xxxd2243xxx 
into the neuron by this pump. like  xxxd2243xxx , the
indirectly acting pressor amine, tyramine, enters the
neuron via the norepinephrine pump. desipramine, protriptyline, and amitriptyline in clinical doses all were
found to block the pressor action of tyramine while
potentiating the pressor effect of norepinephrine. the
amino acid, methyldopa, does not enter the neuron via
the norepinephrine pump, and its antihypertensive action is not altered by concomitant administration of tricyclic antidepressants. it is concluded from the evidence
in this investigation together with the results of previous studies in experimental animals that clinical doses
of desipramine-like drugs inhibit the norepinephrine

action.

introduction
observations by leishman, mathews, and smith (2)
suggested that imipramine may block the effect of
 xxxd2243xxx  in hypertensive patients. studies in experimental animals also have shown that imipraminelike antidepressants will prevent some of the actions of
 xxxd2243xxx  (3, 4). because of the notion that there
is a relation between the psyche and hypertension, the
use of such psychotherapeutic agents in the hypertensive population is widespread. accordingly, studies
were undertaken to obtain data on the clinical significance of interactions between these drugs and  xxxd2243xxx , and to determine whether similar interactions
occurred with the related guanidinium antihypertensives,
 xxxd326xxx  and  xxxd1818xxx . the possibility that the
antagonism resulted from an inhibition of transport of
these antihypertensives to their site of action was
investigated.

methods
the studies were conducted in the clinical research center
of vanderbilt university hospital and in the nashville
veterans administration hospital.
demonstration of drug antagonism. 13 hypertensive
adults (10 men and 3 women) were placed on a regular
hospital diet containing 100 meq of sodium per day. these
patients when hospitalized had persistent hypertension of
moderate to severe degree; on admission their blood pressures while standing ranged from 190 to 250 mm hg in
systole and 115 to 160 mm hg in diastole. four patients
intermittently had mild azotemia (blood urea nitrogen,
30-50 mg/100 ml) but none had liver disease. all medica-

tions, with the exception of  xxxd1884xxx  in one patient, were
discontinued for at least 1 wk before the experimental
period. except for the initial study (patient l. l.) placebo capsules identical in appearance and mode of administration to
desipramine and protriptyline were used during pre and
postexperimental control periods of the studies with  xxxd2243xxx ,  xxxd1818xxx , and methyldopa, in order that patients
would not know when administration of the antidepressant
drugs was initiated. the placebo did not raise the blood
pressure.
after the clinically effective dose of one of the antihypertensive drugs ( xxxd2243xxx  sulfate,  xxxd326xxx  sulfate,
 xxxd1818xxx , or methyldopa) was determined for a
patient, that dose was continued throughout the study. the
total daily dose was divided into two or three doses given
between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. each day. the antihypertensive
drug was administered alone in that fashion for a control
period of at least 5 days before adding the proposed
antagonist, desipramine hydrochloride or protriptyline hydrochloride. the antagonist was given in divided doses 30 min
before the administration of the control doses of the antihypertensive drug. the duration of administration of the
antagonist was determined by the blood pressure response.
after stopping the antagonist, a postantagonist period of at
least 10 days was obtained while the patient continued on the
same dose of the antihypertensive drug. doses and duration
of administration are summarized in table i.
altogether there were seven studies on  xxxd2243xxx , three
on  xxxd326xxx , two on  xxxd1818xxx , and three on methyldopa (two patients were studied twice, using a different
antihypertensive agent in the second study). desipramine

was the proposed antagonist in 14 of the studies, while
protriptyline was given in the 15th.
observations on blood pressure and apical pulse rate were
made at the same hour four times daily with the patient
both in the supine and standing (at least 2 min) positions.
the effects of the drug on computed mean blood pressure
(diastolic blood pressure plus one-third pulse pressure)
were evaluated. the average mean blood pressure in the
standing position was calculated for each day from the four
daily blood pressure determinations. for statistical analysis, the average of each patient's daily mean blood pressures
in the standing position for days 1 through 5 ( xxxd326xxx ,
 xxxd1818xxx , methyldopa patients) or days 2 through 5
( xxxd2243xxx  patients) of the antagonist period was compared by the two-tailed student's unpaired t test with the
corresponding data for both the preantagonist period (the
5 days preceding administration of antagonist) and days
8 through 10 of the postantagonist period (days 11 through
13 for patients g. t. e. and l.l. c. who received increased
doses of antagonist). also, single values representing the
overall average of mean blood pressures for the entire preantagonist, antagonist, and postantagonist intervals as defined above were computed from the daily mean blood
pressures of patients on  xxxd2243xxx . in order to be able
to draw conclusions about the general population of  xxxd2243xxx -treated patients on the basis of the group sampled, the
interval values were statistically analyzed by comparing the
group's values for the antagonist period with their values for
the pre-antagonist and post-antagonist periods by the method
of an individual degree of freedom for a split-plot design (5).

investigation of the mechanism of the antagonism. mildly
hypertensive adults (patients whose blood pressures as outpatients exceeded 140 and 90 mm hg in systole and diastole,
respectively, but returned to the normal range without
treatment upon hospitalization) and normal volunteers were
placed on a regular diet. the volunteers were not required
to stay in the hospital at night. the influences of desipramine,
protriptyline, amitriptyline, and chlorpheniramine maleate
on the norepinephrine transport system in adrenergic
neurons were evaluated by studying the effects of these
agents on the acute pressor responses to intravenous administration of tyramine hydrochloride and 1-norepinephrine
bitartrate. placebos were used for the antidepressants on
nondrug days. tyramine was given in acute inj ections
with the patient supine and monitored by an oscilloscopeelectrocardiogram. blood pressure was recorded at 30-sec
intervals by the indirect auscultatory method. dosage was
increased until the systolic pressure reached or exceeded a
25 mm hg rise over base line value. from dose response
curves, the amount of amine necessary to increase systolic
pressure by 25 mm hg was determined. the "sensitivity"
to the pressor amine was expressed as a ratio of the average
dose on control days to that obtained on the experimental
day (fig. 3). after evalution of the sensitivity to tyramine,
similar dose-pressor response curves were obtained for
norepinephrine, except that the pressor response was deter150r

patients for 22 days and  xxxd2243xxx  (100 mg daily) was
added on days 9-15. pressor responses were determined
on control days and on days 6-8, 13-15, and 21-22. placebos were substituted for  xxxd2243xxx  as well as desipramine on nondrug days.

demonstration of drug antagonism. desipramine
and protriptyline reversed the antihypertensive effects
of  xxxd2243xxx  in every patient to a highly significant
degree (table i). the probability of obtaining a group
of  xxxd2243xxx -treated patients who respond in this way
by random chance from the general population of patients receiving  xxxd2243xxx  is less than 1 in 1000.
the reversal of  xxxd2243xxx 's action was not immediate requiring 1 or 2 days before maximum antagonism
was seen (fig. 1).
the antihypertesnive actions of  xxxd326xxx  and  xxxd1818xxx  also were antagonized (table i). the reversal of their effects was more rapid than with  xxxd2243xxx , with almost maximum antagonism appearing
within a few hours (fig. 2).
in no patient receiving a guanidinium hypotensive
agent did the extent of blood pressure evaluation after
administration of desipramine or protriptyline exceed
that patient's blood pressure off antihypertensive medication. after discontinuation of desipramine (75 mg
daily), 5-7 days were required for the antihypertensive
actions of the guanidiniums to reappear. about 10 days
were necessary for  xxxd2243xxx 's effect to return in

 xxxd326xxx  or methyldopa was given in increasing doses until blood pressure was controlled.
this dose was maintained during the experimental period. desipramine was administered between arrows. methyldopa was discontinued for approximately 3 days beginning 22 july in
order to demonstrate that loss of its effect in this patient would result in a rise in pressure.

than a guanidinium were required to control safely the
patient's blood pressure after administration of the
antidepressant.
in the three studies in which methyldopa was the
antihypertensive, its action was not antagonized by
desipramine (table i, fig. 2). because no antagonism
was demonstrated, the postantagonist period was

related studies in this laboratory have demonstrated
that the guanidinium antihypertensive agents reach their
site of action in adrenergic neurons via a transport
system in the neuron membrane.' this is the same pump
that transports norepinephrine and tyramine into the
neuron. thus, pressor responses to tyramine and norepinephrine can be used as indices of inhibition of this
pump by drugs in man.

mimetic, tyramine, while potentiating the directly-acting
norepinephrine. these effects of desipramine and amitriptyline persisted 5 or more days after stopping the
antagonist, with the longest duration of effect being
seen in the single study with protriptyline.
three types of evidence were obtained to exclude the
possibility that the rise in blood pressure when  xxxd2243xxx  was added to desipramine resulted from a marked
supersensitivity to circulating norepinephrine produced
by the combination of these drugs. whereas the addition of desipramine to antihypertensive doses of  xxxd2243xxx  produced a rise in blood pressure in hypertensive patients, the administration of a large dose of
 xxxd2243xxx  (100 mg daily) for 5 days to three mildly
hypertensive patients receiving desipramine did not
raise blood pressure (table ii). furthermore, the expected hypotensive effect of this dose of  xxxd2243xxx 
was prevented by desipramine. in two of these patients,
the pressor sensitivity to norepinephrine was measured
during therapy with desipramine 75 mg daily alone and
again after 5 days on  xxxd2243xxx  100 mg daily together with the desipramine, and was not consistently
changed by the addition of  xxxd2243xxx  (fig. 6). nor

pressure by only 30/11 mm hg, clearly within the

with hypertension after this dose (6) and unlike the

discussion
the antagonism of the antihypertensive effects of  xxxd2243xxx ,  xxxd326xxx , and  xxxd1818xxx  by desipramine
and protriptyline has obvious therapeutic implications.
that other tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline and nortriptyline also act as antagonists seems
likely.

in addition to obtaining data on the clinical significance of desipramine's interactions with  xxxd2243xxx ,
the present and related investigations1 have clarified
the mechanism of the drug-drug antagonism and have
defined the mechanism of the highly selective pharmacologic effects of  xxxd2243xxx  on adrenergic neurons.
 xxxd2243xxx  and related "adrenergic neuron blocking
drugs" are in fact general inhibitors of nerve and
muscle function since they will also block cholinergic
nerves and skeletal muscle (7, 8). previous work has
suggested that inhibition of adrenergic neuron transmission in vivo is due to concentration of the drugs
within adrenergic tissues (9-11).  xxxd2243xxx ,  xxxd326xxx , and  xxxd1818xxx  have been shown to be taken up
by adrenergic tissues against a concentration gradient

by an energy-requiring transport mechanism located in
the adrenergic neuron membrane.1 uptake of the guanidinium antihypertensive agents is inhibited competitively
by norepinephrine, tyramine, desipramine, and one
another. antagonism of the catecholamine-depleting
effect of  xxxd2243xxx  on the guinea pig heart by
desipramine in vivo is associated with inhibition of
uptake of  xxxd2243xxx  by the heart.' thus, guanethi2 in addition to preventing  xxxd2243xxx 's uptake by the
adrenergic neuron, desipramine also inhibits the hepatic
microsomal metabolism of  xxxd2243xxx  in the rat. mitchell,

 xxxd2243xxx  antagonism

1601

dine and related drugs block adrenergic neurons selectively because they are concentrated within these neurons by the membrane transport system that pumps
norepinephrine into the neuron after its physiologic
release. the necessity of the transport system for
 xxxd2243xxx 's action is shown by the loss of  xxxd2243xxx 's in vivo effect when its uptake is inhibited.
the demonstration that tyramine and norepinephrine
are taken up by the same transport process as the
guanidinium antihypertensive agents provided the rationale for a convenient method of evaluating the effect
of the tricyclic antidepressants on the transport pump
in peripheral adrenergic neurons in man. inhibition of
the uptake of tyramine into the neuron should block
the pressor effect of the indirectly-acting amine. conversely, the pressor effect of norepinephrine should be
potentiated because its action is terminated by the

*,.

pump. the demonstrated inhibition of response to tyramine and potentiation of response to norepinephrine
indicate that the small doses of desipramine, protriptyline, and amitriptyline employed clinically will block
the norepinephrine pump (and  xxxd2243xxx  uptake) in
man. the duration of desipramine's blockade of the
pump is in accord with the delay in the reappearance of
the guanidinium's antihypertensive effects after stopping administration of desipramine.
localization of the antidepressants' antagonism of
 xxxd2243xxx  to the norepinephrine pump in adrenergic
neurons explains desipramine's failure to antagonize
methyldopa, because the entry of this amino acid into
sympathetic nerves does not depend on the pump. the
slow rate at which the antihypertensive action of  xxxd2243xxx  was reversed also is consistent with the idea
that desipramine blocks further uptake of  xxxd2243xxx

figure 6 the effect on pressor sensitivity to norepinephrine of
adding 100 mg of  xxxd2243xxx  daily to the regimen of patients
receiving desipramine. the dose of desipramine was 75 mg daily
(0) or 200 mg daily (0). the lines connect values obtained in
the same patient. pressor sensitivity was determined after at least
5 days of desipramine administration and on the 5th day of
 xxxd2243xxx  administration together with resipramine.

into the neuron and the rate at which the hypotensive
agent loses its effect is dependent on the duration of action of that drug already in the neuron. thus, the
effects of  xxxd326xxx  and  xxxd1818xxx , drugs with short
durations of action, were reversed more rapidly by
desipramine. in addition, the slow onset of the antagonism of  xxxd2243xxx , is in accord with the failure of
gulati, dave, gokhale, and shah (12) to find antagonism of  xxxd2243xxx  by imipramine at the end of 12 hr.
another possible mechanism was considered to explain the increase in blood pressure when desipramine
is added to  xxxd2243xxx . because desipramine and
 xxxd2243xxx  each potentiate norepinephrine's action
when given alone, it might be postulated that the two
together could cause sufficient enhancement of norepinephrine's response to raise blood pressure. the differing rates of reversal of the short- and long-acting
guanidiniums suggests that such dual supersensitivity is
not the mechanism of the blood pressure rise. further,
the administration of large doses of  xxxd2243xxx  to
patients already on desipramine did not elevate the
blood pressure and did not produce greater supersensi-

tivity to infused norepinephrine than that seen with
desipramine alone.
methylphenidate, some phencthiazines, and certain
antihistamines block  xxxd2243xxx 's action in experimental animals (3), presumably via the same mechanism as that of the antidepressants. whether these
observations have clinical relevance remains to be
determined. the tyramine-norepinephrine pressor tests
can be used to evaluate the potency of such drugs as
inhibitors of the norepinephrine transport system in
patients, thereby predicting clinical antagonism of the
guanidinium antihypertensives. the studies with chlorpheniramine, for example, indicate that concomitant
administration- of this antihistamine and the  xxxd2243xxx -like drugs should not be a clinical hazard.
interactions of the tricyclic antidepressants with other
classes of drugs also can be predicted from the present
studies. the evidence for inhibition of the norepinephrine pump indicates that the potency of indirectly:
acting pressor agents such as  xxxd2567xxx  will be
diminished in patients receiving these antidepressant
drugs.

 xxxd2243xxx  antagonism

several mechanisms of clinical drug interactions are
known (13), including induction and inhibition of the
enzymes that metabolize drugs, displacement of drugs
from binding sites on plasma proteins, and alterations
in absorption and excretion. the present investigation
presents a new mechanism for drug-drug interactions in
man-inhibition of the transport of a drug to its site
of action.
