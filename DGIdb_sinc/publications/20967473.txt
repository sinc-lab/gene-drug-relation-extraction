abstract  xxxd3391xxx  is a member of the 2,3-benzodiazepine compound family which is marketed for the treatment of anxiety in some european countries. in contrast to
classical 1,4-benzodiazepines, the compound does not bind
to the benzodiazepine binding site of the c-aminobutyric
acid receptor and its psychopharmacological profile differs
from such compounds. in addition to anxiolytic properties,
antipsychotic effects are reported. we now show that  xxxd3391xxx , 50 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.), administered in
parallel to repeated doses of dizocilpine 0.2 mg/kg i.p. can
ameliorate dizocilpine-induced prolongation of immobility,
which is considered to be a model of negative symptoms of
psychosis. we further show that  xxxd3391xxx  acts as an isoenzyme-selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterases (pdes)
with highest affinity to pde-4a1 (0.42 lm) followed by
pde-10a1 (0.92 lm), pde-3 (1.98 lm) and pde-2a3
(2.11 lm). the data indicate that  xxxd3391xxx  is an interesting candidate for the adjuvant treatment of psychosis
with focus on negative symptoms. combined partial inhibition of pde-4 and pde-10 as well as pde-2 may be the
underlying mechanism to this activity. due to the good
safety profile of  xxxd3391xxx  as evident from long-term use of
this agent in patients, it may be concluded that dual or
triple inhibition of pde isoenzymes with additive or synergistic effects may be an interesting approach to pharmacological activity, resulting in active compounds with

introduction
 xxxd3391xxx , a 2,3-benzodiazepine (2,3-bdzs), represent a
unique drug among cns-active compounds. though sharing
a common chemical backbone to ‘classical’ 1,4-benzodiazepines and though sharing the anxiolytic activity, the compound does not interact with the benzodiazepine binding site
of the c- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) receptor (petocz 1993). it
is an anxiolytic without sedative–hypnotic or muscle relaxant
effects.  xxxd3391xxx  does not impair psychomotor and intellectual performance, like other benzodiazepines do. in contrast, it has a mild cognitive stimulatory activity. it is also
potent in alleviating vegetative symptoms accompanying
anxiety disorders (szeg}o et al. 1993).  xxxd3391xxx  does not
possess anticonvulsive properties and does not induce sleep
even in subtoxic doses, and only such subtoxic doses enhance
the effect of barbiturates and ethanol. applying doses above
200 mg/kg to experimental animals,  xxxd3391xxx  exhibits
effects similar to that of neuroleptics (e.g., catalepsy, ptosis,
decrease of pentylenetetrazole threshold, potentiation of
amphetamine- and apomorphine-induced stereotypy) (petocz
1993). this unique pharmacological profile lead to the conclusion that  xxxd3391xxx  may be of interest for treatment of
psychosis. current antipsychotics are well capable of ameliorating the positive symptoms of a psychotic episode. if
administered chronically, the re-occurrence of such an

123

1320

episode can be retarded or even prevented. however, the
treatment with classical antipsychotic is hampered with side
effects and patient compliance for long-term treatment is often
low, potentially due to these side effects. some of the side
effects of such classical antipsychotics overlap with the negative symptoms of psychosis, i.e., the compounds exert negative effects on attention, concentration, cognition and
memory (arnt and skarsfeldt 1998).
while some 2,3-bdzs and in part also  xxxd3391xxx  have
been shown to induce antipsychotic-like effects in classical
animal models of psychosis linked to the positive symptoms
of the disease, i.e., in the apomorphine climbing test, the
conditioned avoidance reaction and—to a lesser extent—in
the catalepsy test, the pharmacological profile and the side
effect profile of  xxxd3391xxx  in man differs from classical antipsychotics (horváth et al. 2000). due to the reported mild
stimulatory activity (szeg}
o et al. 1993) which is in contrast to
the activity of classical antipsychotics we were interested to
see whether  xxxd3391xxx  may be active in a model of negative
symptoms of psychosis, which mimics the state of avolition.
a respective model has been described by noda et al. (1995).
due to the interesting pharmacological profile of  xxxd3391xxx  we were also interested to learn more about the mechanism of action. early binding studies identified specific and
exclusive binding of 2,3-bdzs within the striatum and
associated structures (horváth et al. 2000). the binding site
was named girisopam binding site, since this 2,3-bdz
derivative was found to have the highest affinity. the distribution of this proposed binding site overlaps largely with
the distribution of the phosphodiesterase 10 isoenzyme
(pde-10), which is highly and selectively expressed in
striatum (seeger et al. 2003). furthermore, pde-10 inhibitors are discussed to be interesting targets for antipsychotic
agents (siuciak et al. 2006). horváth et al. (2000) proposed
that the mechanism of action of  xxxd3391xxx  may be related to
alteration in the phosphorylation of protein(s). while inhibition of phosphodiesterase does not directly result in protein
phosphorylation, the second messengers—cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (camp) or cyclic  xxxd1067xxx  (cgmp)—which are cleaved by phosphodiesterases,
can activate protein kinases resulting in increased protein
phosphorylation. for these reasons we screened different
pde isoenzymes including pde-10 for specific interaction
with  xxxd3391xxx .

established at scottish biomedical, glasgow, uk. in brief,
the assay is based on the high-affinity binding of phosphate
by immobilized metal coordination complexes on nanoparticles. the binding reagent complexes with phosphate
groups on nucleotide monophosphate generated from cyclic nucleotides (camp/cgmp) through phosphodiesterases.
with fluorescence polarization detection, binding causes a
change in the rate of the molecular motion of the phosphate-bearing molecule and results in an increase in the
fluorescence polarization value observed for the fluorescent
label attached to the substrate. using human recombinant
protein of pde-1a3, pde-2a3, pde-3a, pde-4a1, pde5 (catalytic domain only), pde-6c, pde-8a1, pde-9a1,
pde-10a1 and pde-11a1, selective inhibition of different
isoenzymes was screened using a single-point assay at a
concentration of 10,000 nm. the assays have been validated using reference pde inhibitors (mackenzie et al.
2010).  xxxd3391xxx  was dissolved in dmso and diluted in
assay buffer, final dmso concentration 0.1%. reactions
were carried out in duplicate. for isoenzymes where the
single-point analysis resulted in an inhibition [50%, ic50
was determined using the same method but with an 8-point
assay, using 3 parallel experiments for each isoenzyme.
the ic50 determination was conducted for pde-2a3,  xxxg1695xxx , pde-4a1 and pde-10a1.
animals
the animal experiments were carried out on a total of 49
male albino swiss mice weighing 25–30 g purchased from
the licensed breeder (laboratory animals breeding,
górzkowska, warsaw, poland). they were used in this
study after at least 1 week of acclimatization. the animals
were housed in polycarbonate cages in groups of 6–10
under the strictly controlled laboratory conditions (ambient
temperature 22–23°c, relative humidity about 45–55%,
12/12 light/dark cycle, light on at 6:00 h; chow pellets and
tap water continuously available). the experimental protocol was approved by the local ethics committee at the
medical university of lublin (license no. 18/2007), and all
the procedures were in strict compliance with the european
communities council directive of 24 november 1986 (86/
609/eec).

appropriate volumes.
forced swimming test in mice chronically treated
with dizocilpine
acute administration of the potent n-methyl-d-aspartate
(nmda) receptor antagonist phencyclidine can induce
both, positive and negative symptoms of psychosis in
man and exacerbates psychosis in schizophrenic patients
(abdel-naby et al. 2001). in animals, phencyclidine can
induce a wide range of abnormal behaviors which may be
linked to psychotic behavior. upon repeated administration
of phencyclidine, a state of avolition can be induced in
mice, which persists for several days after termination
of treatment with phencyclidine. avolition is one of the
negative symptoms of schizophrenia; it is quantified in a
forced swim test and animals exhibit a state of prolonged
immobility as indicator of avolition (abdel-naby et al.
2001). this model was proposed to be an ideal model of
negative symptoms of psychosis (noda et al. 1995), it is
however limited to the depressive component and may not
be useful to model other negative symptoms such as
learning and memory deficits or social retract.
since phencyclidine is a controlled substance, we have
re-established the model using the nmda-receptor
antagonist dizocilpine instead. the forced swim test and
the drug treatment protocol were carried out on mice
essentially as described by noda et al. (1995). the dose of
dizocilpine and the treatment schedule was selected based
on preliminary experiments (data not presented). on the
first day (friday), each animal was placed individually into
a glass cylinder (height 20 cm, diameter 15 cm) containing
11 cm of water maintained at 23°c, and was forced to
swim for 3 min, and the immobility time was recorded
(first measurement of immobility as baseline measurement). the mouse was judged to be immobile when it
remained floating passively in the water. for induction of
avolition, mice were chronically treated with 0.2 mg/kg
dizocilpine i.p. daily excluding weekends starting on the
fourth day (monday) after the first swim test, until day
19 (friday). after a 2-day drug-free period, on the 22nd
day (monday), each mouse was placed in water again
for 3 min, and the immobility was recorded to test for
prolongation of immobility (second measurement of
immobility).
for the current experiment, a group of 49 mice was
exposed to an initial swim test to determine the individual
immobility time. the mice were thereafter randomized to
three treatment groups of 16–17 mice. three days after this

1321

baseline swim test, treatment was initiated. one group
received the vehicle of dizocilpine and vehicle of  xxxd3391xxx 
(vehicle control group); the second group received treatment with dizocilpine 0.2 mg/kg once daily plus  xxxd3391xxx -vehicle twice daily on 5 days per week (psychosis
control), and a third group dizocilpine 0.2 mg/kg once
daily plus  xxxd3391xxx  50 mg/kg twice daily on 5 days per
week until experimental day 19. the treatment schedule
consisted of two administrations of  xxxd3391xxx  at a dose of
50 mg/kg i.p. each, given 4 h apart. the first dose was
given 10 min before the daily dizocilpine dose. the 4-h
break between two  xxxd3391xxx  administrations was selected
based on the rapid absorption and short half-life of  xxxd3391xxx  (klebovich and abermann 1993) to safely cover
the duration of action of dizocilpine. after a washout of
2 days, a second quantification of immobility was conducted on day 22, about 72 h after the last dizocilpine dose
and 68 h after the last  xxxd3391xxx  dose. this washout period
was selected to ensure that animals are free of both,  xxxd3391xxx  and dizocilpine plasma levels. the half-life of
dizocilpine in rodents is reported to be in the range of 2 h
(vezzani et al. 1989).
statistical analysis
all data are presented as means ± standard error of the
mean (sem), where appropriate. statistical analysis of the
effect of  xxxd3391xxx  on the prolonged immobility after
termination of treatment was performed by one-way
analysis of variance (anova) of the individual differences between the two measurements of immobility followed by tukey’s post hoc test. the use of individual
differences results in a baseline adjustment. a p value less
than or equal to 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
to test for effects of repeated determination of immobility in the same group, individual groups were also
compared using paired t test.

results
phosphodiesterase screen (table 1)
 xxxd3391xxx  was found to act as low-affinity blocker of a
number of pde isoenzymes. while no interaction was found
with pde-6, pde-8, pde-9, and pde-11, weak inhibition
was identified for pde-1 and pde-5. due to an inhibition of
less than 50% measured  xxxd1891xxx ,000 lm, no ic50 was determined for these isoenzymes. inhibition in the high nanomolar to low micromolar range was found for pde-2a3
(2.11 ± 1.8 lm), pde-3a (1.98 ± 1.7 lm), pde-4a1
(0.42 ± 0.8 lm), and pde-10a1 (0.92 ± 1.2 lm).

effects of  xxxd3391xxx  in a model of negative symptoms
of psychosis (fig. 1)
the animals of all three treatment groups had similar
immobility times at the pre-test. in addition, the immobility time of vehicle-treated animals was compared
between the pre-test and the second measurement on day
22 and the immobility time was similar for both assessments, with 95.2 s at the first measurement and 103.2 at
the second measurement (not significant, paired t test),
indicating that repeated measurement of immobility had
no effect on immobility time. as expected, animals which
had received repeated doses of dizocilpine showed a
significant prolongation of the immobility time, with
92.0 s at the first test and 128.2 s at the second test. this
difference was highly significant (p \ 0.001, paired t test)
and the data indicate that the model could be established
successfully.
to evaluate the effect of subchronic treatment of  xxxd3391xxx  on the avolition representing as prolonged immobility induced by repeated administration of dizocilpine,
the individual differences of the immobility times determined during the first measurement on day 1 and second
measurement on day 22 were calculated and compared
using one-way analysis of variance (anova). it became
evident that treatment with  xxxd3391xxx  in parallel to treatment with dizocilpine ameliorated the prolonged immobility time. the immobility of this group amounted to
117 s and was not significantly different from the vehicle
control group. in contrast, the immobility of the mice
treated with dizocilpine was significantly prolonged

groups [anova: f(2, 46) = 0.2696, not significant]. on day 21

discussion
 xxxd3391xxx  is an atypical 2,3-benzodiazepine which does not
bind to benzodiazepine receptors and which is devoid of
cns side effects characteristic of 1,4-benzodiazepines. the
molecule has one chiral centre.  xxxd3391xxx  was marketed in
the racemate form and it was orally administered at 300 mg/
day for its anxiolytic properties (bernard et al. 2008).
the clinical success of  xxxd3391xxx  initiated further
chemical and pharmacological investigations resulting in
structurally related derivatives (láng et al. 1985). among
them, the most active compounds show beside their tranquilizing (anti-aggressive) character particular pharmacological properties reminiscent of both anxiolytics and

 xxxd3391xxx  reduces negative symptoms of psychosis

atypical neuroleptics (andrási et al. 1987; horváth et al.
1989).
the 2,3-bzds  xxxd3391xxx , nerisopam and girisopam were
shown to specifically bind to a binding site in the striatum
and related brain regions (horváth et al. 1994). this
binding site was identified as girisopam binding site
(horváth et al. 2000). the molecular correlate of that
binding site could however not be identified to date.
compounds with affinity to the binding site were found to
be active in models of anxiety including elevated maze,
lick conflict test, light–dark box, and anti-aggressive
behavior in fighting mice and in models of psychosis, i.e.,
in the apomorphine climbing test, the conditioned avoidance reaction and—only at high doses—in the catalepsy
test. the pattern of distribution of this binding site largely
overlaps with the distribution of the pde-10 isoenzyme
(seeger et al. 2003). pde-10 was recently shown to be a
very interesting target for antipsychotic activity and drug
development programs are ongoing to identify novel pde10 inhibitors (schmidt et al. 2008).
we now show that  xxxd3391xxx  acts as an inhibitor of
phosphodiesterases with some selectivity for pde 2, 3, 4
and 10 and affinities in the range of 0.42–2.1 lm. activity
of  xxxd3391xxx  as pde inhibitor was reported previously,
supporting the findings of our study for pde1 to pde5
(bernard et al. 2008). recently, it could be also shown that
 xxxd3391xxx  blocks pde-10a isoenzymes with an affinity of
264 nm for the racemate without stereo-selectivity (nielsen et al. 2007). the same group reported affinity to the
 xxxg1700xxx  isoenzymes with affinity of s(-)- xxxd3391xxx  of
117 nm and r(?)- xxxd3391xxx  of 1,257 nm.
phosphodiesterases are widely distributed throughout
the body, and they serve diverse functions. while pde-3 is
known to selectively affect cardiac contractility by
increasing the intracellular level of cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (goenen 1989), the other three phosphodiesterases targeted by  xxxd3391xxx  have potent cns activity,
and more specifically are discussed to be useful for amelioration of symptoms of psychosis. the oldest phosphodiesterase target for treatment of symptoms of psychosis is
the pde-4 isoenzyme.  xxxd3142xxx , being the prototype pde4 inhibitor, was shown to have not only antidepressant and
immune modulator, but also antipsychotic and cognitive
enhancing activity (kanes et al. 2007). however, the
clinical utility of  xxxd3142xxx  and other pde-4 inhibitors is
hampered by the fact that these compounds induce emesis,
nausea and gastrointestinal side effect.  xxxd3140xxx  is the
only selective potent pde4 inhibitor which is submitted for
marketing approval for the treatment of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, albeit with a narrow margin of safety
(field 2008).  xxxd3140xxx , however, is not published to be
active in behavioral models of cns diseases and it is not
known whether  xxxd3140xxx  can penetrate the brain. the

1323

compound has a plasma protein binding of 98.9% (bethke
et al. 2007).
the discovery that pde-10 is selectively expressed in
medium spiny neurons of the striatum and the correlation of
pde-10 function with dopaminergic neurotransmission has
placed pde-10 as a highly interesting novel target for
treatment of psychosis (siuciak et al. 2006). pde-10 inhibitors exhibit a broad spectrum of antipsychotic activity in
different animal models (siuciak et al. 2006; siuciak 2008;
schmidt et al. 2008). both, effects in models of positive and
negative symptoms are reported. the pharmacological
activity could be correlated not only to an inhibition of the
d2-receptor-dominated pathways, but also to a facilitation of
the d1-receptor-dominated prefrontal pathways. this combination of activity is believed to be highly interesting for the
amelioration of negative symptoms of psychosis (siuciak
2008). the target is subject to drug discovery programs, but
none of these programs has reached a state of proof of efficacy in patients (verhoest et al. 2009).
the pde-2 isoenzyme is a further candidate for the
treatment of symptoms of psychosis, however, with
focus on the memory impairment contributing to the negative symptoms of psychosis (boess et al. 2004; domekłopacińska and strosznajder 2008). furthermore, anxiolytic
effects may be mediated by pde-2 inhibition (masood et al.
2009).
we now show that  xxxd3391xxx  acts as a mixed blocker of
all three psychosis treatment related targets. the affinity of
 xxxd3391xxx  to these isoenzymes is in the same range or even
higher than the affinity of  xxxd3142xxx  which was found to
have an affinity of 1.1 lm (bernard et al. 2008). while
 xxxd3391xxx  remains to be a low-affinity pde inhibitor if
compared with modern pde inhibitors, it is possible that
the pharmacological activity is mediated by its interaction
with some or all of these phosphodiesterase isoenzymes. in
volunteers administered a single dose of 100 mg  xxxd3391xxx ,
a maximal plasma level of 328.8 ng/ml was reached, equal
to about 0.9 lm. the apparent volume of distribution
ranged from 523.8 to 5,154.1 l-1 indicating that  xxxd3391xxx 
has higher concentration in extravascular tissue than in the
vascular compartment. the half-life was found to be in the
range of 4 h, indicating that upon three times daily
administration of 100 mg some accumulation can be
expected (tóth et al. 2006). these data indicate that the
steady-state tissue concentration can be expected to be in
the range of or even higher than the ic50 of pde-4, pde10, and potentially also pde-2 resulting in a partial block
of these enzymes.
in the in vivo model, the repeated administration of
dizocilpine lead to the expected prolongation of immobility
in the mice tested. it should be noted that the reactivity of
the mice cannot be correlated to an acute drug-effect of
dizocilpine, which is known to induce hyperactivity if

123

1324

administered to animals. due to the washout time of 3 days
after the last dose and in view of the half-life of dizocilpine
in rodents in the range of 2 h (vezzani et al. 1989), the
behavioral modification of the mice may rather be correlated to a chronic plasticity. our data indicate that the
model initially described using phencyclidine can be generated using dizocilpine instead (noda et al. 1995).
 xxxd3391xxx , administered twice daily to the mice, was
capable of reducing the increased immobility in our model.
the effect was evident 3 days after the last dose of  xxxd3391xxx , indicating that the effect cannot be related to an
acute effect of  xxxd3391xxx  on mouse behavior. the
enhancement of immobility induced by subchronic
administration of nmda antagonists is attenuated by
clozapine and risperidone, which are known to improve
negative symptoms in patients, but not by haloperidol,
which does not improve them (noda et al. 1995, 2000).
 xxxd3391xxx  thus bears the potential to ameliorate negative
symptoms of psychosis such as avolition; however, no
complete normalization could be obtained. this may be
related to the short half-life of  xxxd3391xxx  in rodents, but
further experiments are needed to evaluate the potential of
 xxxd3391xxx  or other (more potent) 2,3-bzds in psychosis.
other models of negative symptoms of psychosis should be
also employed to evaluate whether negative symptoms
beyond avolition are also modified.
it may be discussed which phosphodiesterase isoenzymes may be responsible for the observed pharmacological action in mice. both, pde-4 and pde-10 isoenzymes
are involved in pharmacological action which may result in
effects on negative symptoms of psychosis. siuciak
reviewed in 2008 the role of phosphodiesterases in psychosis and she concludes that both isoenzymes bear great
potential for the treatment of positive symptoms, negative
symptoms and/or cognitive deficits associated with
schizophrenia (siuciak 2008). drugs targeting both targets
may be of even higher interest. while the potential of such
dual inhibitors has not yet been explored systematically
and while no cns-active drugs with selectivity for pde-4
or pde-10 are marketed so far, the availability of  xxxd3391xxx  enables a first insight in the potential of such dual
inhibitors. furthermore, the additional inhibition of pde-2
may also contribute to the overall activity, adding anxiolytic effects and potentially also positive effects on cognitive function.  xxxd3391xxx  is not afflicted with the
well-known side effects of selective pde-4 inhibitors. while
bernard et al. (2008) discuss that  xxxd3391xxx  may represent
a novel structural class of tolerated pde-4 inhibitors
without emetogenic potential, an alternative explanation to
the good tolerability may be that the combination of a
partial block of multiple pdes with additive or even synergistic pharmacological effects results in the observed
pharmacology, while preventing the toxicity known from

123

c. rundfeldt et al.

highly selective and potent compounds, dosed to induce a
complete block of individual enzymes.
other 2,3-bzds may be systematically evaluated for
