summary - the mechanism(s) responsible for arterial vasodilation observed following acute administration of racemic carvedilol, a novel vasodilator/beta adrenoceptor antagonist, has been investigated in rats.
in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats, carvedilol(o.03-3.0 mg/kg, iv) produced a dose-dependent
reduction in blood pressure with no significant effect on heart rate. because cardiac output was relatively
unaffected, the antihypertensive response of carvedilol was associated with a dose-dependent reduction
in total peripheral vascular resistance. submaximal antihypertensive doses of carvedilol were chosen for
mechanism of action studies in pithed rats. carvedilol (0:3 mg/kg, iv) produced a significant inhibition
of the p, adrenoceptor mediated positive chronotropic response to  xxxd2401xxx . this same dose of carvedilol also inhibited, but to a lesser degree, the p, adrenoceptor mediated vasodepressor response to salbutamol in pithed rats whose blood pressure was elevated by a constant intravenous infusion of angiotensin 11.
thus, carvedilol blocks both p, and pzadrenoceptors at antihypertensive doses, with modest selectivity
being observed for the p, adrenoceptor subtype. carvedilol produced significant inhibition of the a,
adrenoceptor mediated pressor response to  xxxd1707xxx  in the pithed rat, but had no effect on the a,
adrenoceptor mediated pressor response to b-ht 933, suggesiing that carvedilol is also an a,adrenoceptor antagonist at antihypertensive doses. carvedilol had no effect on the pressor response elicited by angiotensin 11, indicating a lack of nonspecific vasodilator activity. the vasopressor response to the calcium
channel activator, bay-k-8644, which is mediated through the opening of voltage dependent calcium channels and the subsequent translocation of extracellular calcium, was significantly inhibited by carvedilol
(1 mg/kg, iv), suggesting that carvedilol is also a calcium channel antagonist, consistent with our previous
in virro studies. in anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats, the antihypertensive activity of carvedilol
was nearly abolished by combined pretreatment of the rats with high doses of the a , adrenoceptor antagonist,  xxxd3000xxx  (1 mg/kg, iv), and the nonselective p adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (3 mg/kg,
iv), suggesting that the majority of the antihypertensive response produced by carvedilol may be accounted for by blockade of p and a, adrenoceptors. we therefore conclude that carvedilol, at antihypertensive
doses, is an antagonist of p,, p2, and a, adrenoceptors, and also of calcium channels in vascular smooth
muscle. the p, adrenoceptor blocking properties of carvedilol appear to account for the lack of reflex
tachycardia that occurs in response to baroreceptor activation, and the arterial vasodilation appears to
result largely from selective a , adrenoceptor blockade, with little or no contribution being derived from
calcium channel blockade.

introduction

carvedilol (fig 1) is a novel antihypertensive agent that is both a p adrenoceptor antagonist and a peripheral arterial vasodilator. the /3 adrenoceptor blocking property
of carvedilol is responsible for blunting or inhibiting reflex tachycardia which is secondary to activation of baroreflexes by the vasodilating activity of the molecule (eggertsen et al, 1987). the mechanism responsible for the vasodilator activity of carvedilol
has not been completely established, since this compound has been shown to possess
a variety of pharmacologic actions over a wide range of concentrations (sponer et
al, 1987; strein et al, 1987; nichols et al, 1989b). we have previously shown in vitro
that carvedilol, in addition to being a potent /3 adrenoceptor antagonist with little
selectivity for p, adrenoceptors, is also a potent al adrenoceptor antagonist and a
moderately potent calcium channel blocker (nichols et al, 1989b). thus, it has been
proposed that the vasodilator activity of carvedilol results from a,adrenoceptor antagonism and/or calcium channel blockade (nichols et al, 1989b). however, these
actions of carvedilol are not produced at similar concentrations, and their relevance
to the antihypertensive action of carvedilol following systemic administration has not
been fully established. our in vitro studies indicate that calcium channel blockade
by carvedilol occurs at higher concentrations than those required to block a1 and p
adrenoceptors, and that a, adrenoceptor blockade may be the primary mechanism
for the peripheral arterial vasodilation produced by carvedilol. to test this hypothesis, we have investigated the pharmacologic properties of carvedilol following acute
administration in vivo in order to determine which activities occur at antihypertensive doses, and to establish whether or not these multiple activities play a role in the
antihypertensive action, and more specifically, the vasodilation produced by carvedilol.

previously described (gellai and valtin, 1979; allen and gellai, 1987). briefly, the rats were
anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (60 mg/kg, im) and sodium pentobarbital (20 mg/kg,
ip), after which tygon catheters were implanted in the abdominal aorta and vena cava via the
left femoral artery and vein, respectively. a pulsed doppler flow probe was placed around
the ascending aorta. all catheters and lead wires were tunneled under the skin and exited in
the midscapular region and the catheters were filled with a 1/1 mixture of 50% dextrose and
heparin (1000 u/ml) and sealed with stainless steel pins. prior to and for 5-7 d following surgery, the rats were accustomed to a plastic restrainer (model ecu, braintree scientific inc,
braintree, ma).
following complete recovery from surgery (5-7 d), the rats were placed in the restrainer
and the arterial catheter was connected to a statham p23 g6 pressure transducer and the doppler flow probe leads were connected to a doppler flow meter (model 545c-3, bioengineering
research facility, iowa city, ia). heart rate was measured by a beckman 9857b cardiotachometer triggered by the pulsatile doppler signal. all parameters were recorded on a beckman r611
dynograph recorder. dose-response curves'for the effects of carvedilol on mean aortic pressure, heart rate and aortic blood flow were constructed by the method of stepwise cumulative
intravenous administration of the compound given as 1 ml/kg bolus doses of 0.03 to 3.0 mg/kg
given at 5-min intervals. doses of carvedilol that produced significant but submaximal reductions in mean arterial blood pressure were chosen from these studies and were used in the pithed
rat experiments for the examination of the mechanism of arterial vasodilation.

pithed normotensive rats
male normotensive sprague-dawley rats (300-400 g, charles river, wilmington, de) were
anesthetized with sodium  xxxd2599xxx (60 mg/kg, ip). the tracheas were cannulated and the
rats were pithed by passing a steel rod (1.5 mrn in diameter) through the orbit and foramen
magnum down into the spinal canal. immediately after pithing, the tracheal cannula was
connected to a harvard apparatus model 680 rodent respirator and the rats were artificially
ventilated at a frequency of 60 cycles/min with a tidal volume of 2 m1/100 g body weight,
systemic arterial blood pressure was measured from the right common carotid artery via a
statham p23 id pressure transducer and was recorded on a beckman r611 dynograph recorder.
the left femoral vein was cannulated for the intravenous administration of drugs in a volume
of i ml/kg.
to assess p, adrenoceptor antagonist activity, a cumulative dose-response curve was
constructed for the positive chronotropic response to  xxxd2401xxx  15 min after pretreatment
of the animals with either vehicle or carvedilol. although it has been demonstrated that mammalian myocardium possesses both p , and pr adrenoceptors (broadley, 1982), only the pi
adrenoceptor subtype mediates functional responses in the rat myocardium (juberg el ul, 1985).
thus, inhibition of the chronotropic response to  xxxd2401xxx  is an accurate measure of pi
adrenoceptor antagonist activity (ruffolo and morgan, 1984).
to assess p2 adrenoceptor antagonist activity, rats were prepared and pithed as described
above, and in addition the right femoral vein was cannulated for the intravenous infusion of
angiotensin i1 with a sage instruments model 341a infusion pump. after a io-min equilibration period following the administration of either vehicle or carvedilol, an infusion of angiotensin
i1 was started at a rate of 150 ng/kg/min, iv, which elevated diastolic blood pressure by
68 f 4 mmhg in the vehicle treated animals and by 69 f 5 mmhg in the carvedilol-treated
animals. following an additional 5 min equilibration period, when the angiotensin i1 pressor
response had stabilized, a vasodepressor dose-response curve to the selective flz adrenocep

tor agonist, salbutamol, was constructed cumulatively, with depressor responses being measured as decreases in diastolic blood pressure in mmhg. it has been demonstrated that in the
pithed rat, p adrenoceptor agonists decrease vascular tone via activation of pz adrenoceptors
(docherty and mcgrath, 1982; wilffert el at, 1982; ruffolo and yaden, 1983). thus, inhibition of the vasodepressor response to salbutamol is an accurate assessment of pz adrenoceptor antagonist activity.
to examine the mechanism(s) of vasodilation, the ability of carvedilol to interfere with a ,
and az adrenoceptor and angiotensin i1 receptor mediated pressor responses was studied.
dose-response curves for the pressor effects of selective agonists of these receptors were
constructed cumulatively, with responses being measured as increases in diastolic blood pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmhg). pressor responses to the selective a , adrenoceptor
agonist,  xxxd1707xxx , the selective az adrenoceptor agonist, b-ht 933, and to angiotensin i1 were
elicited 15 min after the intravenous administration of vehicle or carvedilol. we have shown
previously that the vasopressor responses elicited by  xxxd1707xxx  and b-ht 933 are mediated
exclusively by postjunctional vascular a,and az adrenoceptors, respectively, with no crossover
between the receptor subtypes (ruffolo et a/, 1984; nichols and ruffolo, 1986).
because in vitro studies have established that carvedilol can also block calcium channels in
a variety of tissues (hattori et al, 1989; nichols et a/, 1989b), we also investigated the effects
of an antihypertensive dose of carvedilol on the vasopressor response mediated by the selective
calcium channel activator, bay-k-8644. we and others have previously shown that the vasopressor response to bay-k-8644 in pithed rats is mediated by the influx of extracellular calcium,
and that these responses are antagonized by calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine (nichols
ef at, 1989a). the dose-response curve of bay-k-8644 was constructed 15 min after the administration of vehicle or carvedilol (1 mg/kg, iv).
anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats

male okamoto- aoki spontaneously hypertensive rats (250-300 g, taconic farms, germantown, ny) were anesthetized with sodium thiobutabarbital (120 mg/kg, ip) and the tracheas
were cannulated to allow the rats to breathe room air spontaneously. the right carotid artery
was cannulated for the measurement of systemic arterial blood pressure via a statham p23 id
pressure transducer connected to a beckman r611 dynograph recorder. heart rate was measured by a beckman 9857b cardiotachometer triggered by the pulse pressure and recorded on
the dynograph. the left jugular vein was cannulated for the administration of drugs in a volume
of 1 ml/kg. the animals were allowed to stabilize for at least 30 min before drug administration. dose-response curves for the effects of carvedilol on diastolic blood pressure were constructed by the method of stepwise cumulative intravenous administration of the compound.
the cumulative dose of carvedilol was increased approximately 3-fold at each step, with each
successive dose being given only when the response to the previous dose had attained a maximum level and remained steady. the dose-response curve to the antihypertensive activity of
carvedilol in spontaneously hypertensive rats was determined 20 min after the administration
of a combination of either saline (1 ml/kg, iv) or  xxxd3000xxx  (1 mg/kg, iv) plus propranolol
(3 mg/kg, iv) to produce a high degree of blockade of a,,
0, and pz adrenoceptors.

cious spontaneously hypertensive rats. it is apparent that carvedilol produces dosedependent reductions in blood pressure with no significant changes in heart rate being observed except at the highest dose used which produced a small bradycardia.
this pattern of reduction in arterial blood pressure in the absence of a reflex increase
in heart rate is characteristic of carvedilol (eggertsen et al, 1987), and the inhibition
of reflex tachycardia has been attributed to the p adrenoceptor blocking activity of
the drug (strein et al, 1987). cardiac output was unaffected by carvedilol, indicating
that the dose-dependent reduction in mean arterial blood pressure resulted from
decreases in peripheral vascular resistance, confirming that carvedilol is indeed an
arterial vasodilator. doses of 0.3 and 1 mg/kg, iv, which reduced mean arterial blood
pressure by at least 50 mmhg and were associated with significant vasodilator activity as assessed by reductions in total peripheral vascular resistance, were used in further studies in pithed rats on the mechanism of action of carvedilol.
at the antihypertensive dose of 0.3 mg/kg, iv, carvedilol produced marked inhibition of the p1 adrenoceptor mediated positive chronotropic response elicited by
 xxxd2401xxx  in pithed rats, with a dose ratio of approximately 100 being observed
(fig 3a). at this same dose, carvedilol also inhibited the p2 adrenoceptor mediated
vasodilator response to salbutamol in pithed rats whose blood pressure was elevated
by a constant intravenous infusion of angiotensin i1 (fig 3b). however, carvedilol
produced only a 15-fold rightward shift in the dose-response curve to salbutamol,
indicating that the degree of inhibition of the p1adrenoceptor response by carvedilol
was approximately 7-fold greater than the inhibition of the p2 adrenoceptor response,
indicative of modest cardioselectivity.
in order to determine whether carvedilol is an a , and/or a2 adrenoceptor antagonist, we evaluated the effect of carvedilol on the a l adrenoceptor mediated pressor response to  xxxd1707xxx  and the a2 adrenoceptor mediated pressor response to
b-ht 933. we have previously shown that  xxxd1707xxx  and b-ht 933 elicit pr'essor
responses in pithed rats by selectively stimulating postjunctional vascular a i and u2
adrenoceptors, respectively, with no cross-over between the a adrenoceptor subtypes
(ruffolo et al, 1984;.nichols and ruffolo, 1986). carvedilol(o.3 mg/kg, iv) produced
significant inhibition of the ui adrenoceptor mediated pressor response to  xxxd1707xxx 
(fig 4a), with a dose ratio of approximately 3 being obtained. in contrast, carvedilol
did not significantly inhibit the a2 adrenoceptor mediated pressor response to b-ht
933 (fig 4b), suggesting that carvedilol is a selective a ivis-a-vis a2 adrenoceptor antagonist at antihypertensive doses.
to investigate possible nonspecific vasodilating activity of carvedilol, we also studied
the effects of the compound on the vasoconstrictor response to another vasopressor
agent, angiotensin 11. figure 5 shows that carvedilol (0.3 mg/kg, iv) did not significantly affect the vasoconstrictor response to angiotensin i1 in pithed rats at a dose
that inhibited pi and a iadrenoceptors, indicating that carvedilol is not a nonspecific vasodilator, such as hydralazine.
in order to establish whether or not the calcium channel blocking activity of carvedilol, which has been identified in vitro by us (nichols et al, 1989b) and by others

sure, which previous studies have shown is inhibited by various calcium channel antagonists, such as nifedipine (nichols et al, 1989a). carvedilol at an antihypertensive
dose significantly inhibited the vasopressor response to bay-k-8644, with the inhibition being greatest at the higher doses of the calcium channel activator. the results
indicate that calcium channel blockade does occur with carvedilol in a dose range

that is consistent with the antihypertensive and vasodilator effects of the drug
(fig 2).
we therefore identified 2 mechanisms by which acute administration of carvedilol
may produce peripheral arterial vasodilation, namely postjunctional vascular a 1
adrenoceptor blockade and calcium channel blockade. in order to determine whether
one or both of these components were involved in the antihypertensive response of
carvedilol, we investigated the antihypertensive effect of carvedilol in spontaneously
hypertensive rats pretreated with a high dose of  xxxd3000xxx  (1 mg/kg, iv) to block a,
adrenoceptors and propranolol(3 mg/kg, iv) to block both p, and p2 adrenoceptors.
our reasoning was that if blockade of a l , p1 and p2 adrenoceptors eliminated the antihypertensive activity of carvedilol, then the activity of this compound could be attributed, to a large extent, to blockade of these receptors by carvedilol. resting diastolic
blood pressure was reduced from 125 f 12 mmhg in control animals to 78 f 6 mmhg
in animals pretreated with  xxxd3000xxx  and propranolol, and heart rate was reduced from
375 f 13 beats/min to 248 k 9 beats/min. in control spontaneously hypertensive rats,
carvedilol produced a dose-dependent reduction in diastolic blood pressure, whereas
in animals pretreated with  xxxd3000xxx  and propranolol, the antihypertensive activity of
carvedilol was virtually abolished (fig 7), suggesting that a l , p1 and p2 adrenoceptor

blockade can account, to a large extent, for the acute antihypertensive activity of car.
vedilol. although we cannot completely rule out a role for calcium channel blockade
by carvedilol, this action is expected to contribute to a smaller extent.

discussion
carvedilol is a novel vasodilator/p adrenoceptor antagonist that lowers blood pressure by reducing total peripheral vascular resistance in experimental animals and humans (eggertsen et al, 1987; strein et al, 1987; sundberg et al, 1987). however, the
precise mechanism by which carvedilol produces vasodilation has been the subject
of some controversy. the proposed mechanisms for arterial vasodilation by carvedilol
include: 1) a direct vascular smooth muscle relaxation that results in nonspecific
vasodilation (bartsch et al, 1987; sponer et al, 1987; strein et al, 1987), 2) a l
adrenoceptor antagonism (cubeddu et al, 1987; seki et al, 1988; nichols et al, i989b)
and 3) calcium channel blockade (hattori et al, 1989; nichols et al, 1989b). our previous in vitro studies have shown that, in addition to the well-characterized pi and pz
adrenoceptor antagonist properties of carvedilol, this compound is also a potent al
adrenoceptor antagonist and a moderately potent calcium channel antagonist (nichols
et af, 1989b). as such, we have investigated the pharmacologic profile of carvedilol
in vivo and have studied the possible relevant mechanism(s) involved in vasodilation.

fig 7. the antihypertensive activity of carvedilol in anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats pretreated with the a,-adrenoceptor antagonist,  xxxd3000xxx  ( 1 mg/kg, iv) and the p-adrenoceptor antagonist,
propranolol (3 mg/kg, iv).

in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats, carvedilol produced a dose-dependent
reduction in blood pressure over the dose range from 0.1-3 mg/kg iv. because heart
rate and cardiac output were not significantly affected, the antihypertensive effects
of carvedilol reflect reductions in total peripheral vascular resistance, confirming that
carvedilol is a vasodilator. doses of carvedilol of 0.3 and 1 mg/kg iv were chosen
for further studies on the mechanism of arterial vasodilation in pithed rats.
carvedilol (0.3 mg/kg iv) produced a high degree of pi adrenoceptor blockade as
evidenced by the large inhibition of the positive chronotropic response to  xxxd2401xxx .
thus, in the antihypertensive dose range of carvedilol, pi adrenoceptors will, for all
intents and purposes, be completely blocked. as a direct consequence, reductions in
total peripheral vascular resistance will not result in compensatory reflex increases
in heart rate and cardiac output produced by increased sympathetic outflow as a consequence of baroreceptor activation. the baroreflex mediated increase in heart rate
and cardiac output that would normally accompany a reduction in total peripheral
resistance by a vasodilator are therefore attenuated or completely inhibited by carvedilol, as evidenced in figure 2. as such, the decrease in blood pressure that results
from the reduction in peripheral vascular resistance by carvedilol will be more marked
than that which would occur in the absence of adrenoceptor blockade, which accounts for the observation that antihypertensive responses to a adrenoceptor antagonists are enhanced by p adrenoceptor blockade (johnson et d,1976).

aj nichols et a1

in addition to the marked p1adrenoceptor blockade produced by carvedilol, a significant degree of p2 adrenoceptor blockade was observed. under normal supine conditions, the circulating levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine are below those levels
required to activate vascular p2 adrenoceptors. however, when standing, there is an
increase in circulating catecholamine levels (robertson et al, 1979; goldberg et al,
1983) which may be of sufficient magnitude to activate vascular p2 adrenoceptors to
produce vasodilation. if this were to occur in the presence of reduced vascular resistance due to al adrenoceptor and/or calcium channel blockade, one might anticipate
an increased propensity for postural hypotension, especially if reflex tachycardia were
also blocked. during presyncopal episodes caused by peripheral vasodilation, circulating epinephrine levels have been observed to increase markedly (robertson et a/, 1979),
thus potentially causing vascular p2 adrenoceptor activation which may contribute
to peripheral arterial and possibly venous vasodilation to exacerbate the syncope. thus,
blockade of vascular p2 adrenoceptors may reduce the tendency for postural hypotension to occur in the presence of reduced vascular resistance. it is unclear as to what
role the p2 adrenoceptor blocking activity of carvedilol may play in its antihypertensive activity. however, studies in man with ici 118,551, a selective p2 adrenoceptor
antagonist (tattersfield and cragg, 1983) have shown that at doses that are sufficient to produce significant ,b2 adrenoceptor blockade, no antihypertensive activity
is seen in hypertensive patients that respond to p, adrenoceptor antagonists (robb
et al, 1988). thus, it is unlikely that the p2 adrenoceptor antagonist activity of carvedilol will contribute to its hypotensive properties.
at an antihypertensive dose of 0.3 mg/kg iv, carvedilol also significantly inhibited
the a 1 adrenoceptor-mediated pressor response to  xxxd1707xxx , but did not affect the
a2 adrenoceptor-mediated pressor response to b-ht 933. these indicate that carvedilol is also an a1 adrenoceptor antagonist at antihypertensive doses, consistent
with our previous in vitro findings (nichols et al, 1989b).
although selective postjunctional vascular al adrenoceptor blockade by carvedilol
may be responsible for the peripheral arterial vasodilation that occurs with this drug,
carvedilol at a slightly higher dose (1 mg/kg, iv) which still falls within the antihypertensive and vasodilator range, significantly inhibited the vasopressor response elicited by the calcium channel activator, bay-k-8644. these results suggest that calcium
channel blockade may also contribute to peripheral arterial vasodilation produced
by carvedilol, especially at the higher doses.
as was apparent from our previous in vitro studies (nichols et al, 1989b), carvedilol
possesses more than one possible mechanism for reducing peripheral vascular
resistance, namely a1 adrenoceptor blockade and calcium channel blockade. the possibility of a nonspecific vasodilator action of carvedilol, as observed with hydralazine, may be eliminated based on the results obtained in the present study, inasmuch
as carvedilol did not significantly attenuate the vasopressor response to either angiotensin i1 or the selective u2 adrenoceptor agonist, b-ht 933. as such, our data suggest
that selective postjunctional vascular a l adrenoceptor blockade and possibly calcium channel blockade are responsible for the vasodilating activity of carvedilol.

vasodilation produced by carvedilol

in order to determine whether the peripheral vasodilating effect of carvedilol results
solely from postjunctional a,adrenoceptor blockade, we investigated the antihypertensive activity of carvedilol in spontaneously hypertensive rats pretreated with a high
dose of  xxxd3000xxx  (1 mg/kg iv), to block a, adrenoceptors. because carvedilol also
blocks pi adrenoceptors (fig 3), and because this activity may contribute to the antihypertensive response of carvedilol by blocking reflex tachycardia, we also pretreated these rats with a high dose of propranolol (3 mg/kg, iv). under complete al and
p adrenoceptor blockade, the antihypertensive response to carvedilol was nearly
abolished, suggesting that a1 and pi adrenoceptor blockade by carvedilol can account,
to a large extent, for the antihypertensive activity of this drug. as such, we conclude
that the calcium channel blocking activity of carvedilol, which does occur within the
antihypertensive dose range, plays a relatively minor role in the antihypertensive
response of carvedilol.
the results of the present study indicate that carvedilol is a potent antagonist of
a,,pi and pz adrenoceptors within the antihypertensive dose range of this compound.
furthermore, carvedilol is also a calcium channel blocker at higher antihypertensive
doses of the drug. however, the antihypertensive activity of carvedilol results, to a
large extent, from a1 and pi adrenoceptor blockade, which suggests that the calcium
channel blocking activity of carvedilol does not contribute significantly to the vasodilating action of the drug.
