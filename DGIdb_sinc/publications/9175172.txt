summary the recent discovery of cyiooxygenase-2 (cox-2), an isoenzyme associated mainly with inflammation
created the need to reevaluate cyclooxygenase inhibitors with reliable screening methods. in the present study we
standardized a technique to determine the icsos of cyclooxygenase inhibitors on recombinant human cox-1 and
cox-2 expressed in mammalian cells and used it to study the compounds  xxxd3311xxx , aspirin and indomethacin. the
ica0s of aspirin, indomethacin and  xxxd3311xxx  for human cox-1 were 0.41 _+0.07 gg/ml, 0.008 _+0.003 gg/ml, and
7.94 _ 3.28 gg/ml, respectively, and for human cox-2 0.64 _+0.16 gg/ml, 0.09 _+0.05 gg/ml, and 10.61 _+ 1.50 gg/ml,
for aspirin, indomethacin, and  xxxd3311xxx .  xxxd3311xxx  had the lowest icso  xxxg1884xxx /ics0 hcox-1 ratio (1.34), followed
by aspirin (1.53) and indomethacin (10.82). the system described in the present study provides a simple and efficient
way to determine the specificity of nsaid inhibition for each of the human cyclooxygenase isoenzymes separately.
introduction

cyclooxygenase is the first enzyme involved in the
synthesis of prostaglandins, catalyzing the formation of
prostaglandin h2 (pgh2) from  xxxd208xxx . the
unstable pgh2 is the common precursor of prostaglandins and thromboxane. cyclooxygenase is the
primary target of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(nsmds), and this action is believed to be responsible for
their anti-inflammatory action. ~unfortunately, inhibition
of prostaglandin production in organs where they play a
physiological role, such as stomach and kidney, can result
in gastric lesions and nephrotoxicity, important side
effects that limit the use of these drugs.
recent studies have shown the existence of two isoforms of cyclooxygenase. the first isoenzyme described,
 xxxg1883xxx  (cox-1, pch synthase, e.c. 1.14.99.1),

received 19 june 1996

often referred to as a housekeeping enzyme, is expressed
constitutively and is ubiquitously distributed.2-s the
recently discovered isoenzyme,  xxxg1884xxx  (cox2), is usually absent or present at low levels in nonproliferating cells, but its expression is increased by
mitogens and conditions that stimulate proliferation,7-8
by phorbol esters, 3 prostaglandins,9 calcium ionophore ~°
and different inflammatory cytokines.1°-i4 cox-2 expression is inhibited by glucocorticoids. 2,6-7,i~,14-~5the cox-2
gene has some characteristics of an early-response gene
and its transcriptional regulation is quite complex. these
facts suggest that cox-1 is responsible for the basal synthesis of prostaglandins participating in physiological
processes, whereas cox-2 is responsible for prostaglandin production in inflammation and pathological
situations. this hypothesis has been substantiated by
the demonstration that the most important isoenzyme
in human rheumatoid synovial membrane 16 and in the
rat air pouch model of inflammation~z is cox-2, and
that compounds capable of inhibiting specifically cox-2
are anti-inflammatory but non-ulcerogenic in animal
models, lz

the cdnas encoding cox-1 and cox-2 have been
cloned from mouse 18-2° and human s o u r c e s 5'21-22 a n d
expressed in vitro.4,s'19-21 cox-1 and cox-2 from the
same species exhibit about 60% amino acid sequence
identityy specific residues of the cox-1 protein, such as
ser530, have now been identified as being important in
the catalytic site. 23-25 each of these residues is conserved
in cox-2 (cox-1 ser530 is cox-2 set516), 23 suggesting
that the enzymatic mechanisms are fundamentally the
same for both isoenzymes. nonetheless, the differences
in primary structures between cox-1 and cox-2 suggest
that there may be subtle differences in how the two
isoenzymes behave and that these differences could lead
to different affinities for fatty acid substrates and nsaids.
it has been shown that murine cox-1 and cox-2 differ
in their sensitivity to inhibition by some nsmds 2° as
do human cox-1 and cox-2.26 selective inhibition of
cox-2 would, thus, be possible, and could provide an
anti-inflammatory action without the side effects of the
currently available nsmds. 2°,2z most currently available
nsmds, however, are preferential inhibitors of cox-1.2°,26
this is not surprising since they have been screened in
in vitro systems containing mostly cox-1.
an ideal system to test the sensitivities of human
cox isoenzymes to different inhibitors should allow the
testing of each isoenzyme separately. however, cox-1 is
a rather ubiquitous enzyme in differentiated mammalian
cells, cox-2 is frequently expressed in huge amounts in
cells undergoing proliferation, and both are frequently
present in the same cells. an adequate approach to this
problem would be to find mammalian cells that can be
maintained in culture and do not express cox-1 or cox2 and transfect them with the specific human cdnas,
thus permitting adequate post-translational modification
of the expressed enzymes. the objective of the present
study was to find an immortalized mammalian cell line
that does not express endogenous cox-1 or cox-2 and
to standardize a transfecfion technique capable of producing functional human cox-1 or human cox-2 in
sufficient amounts to allow the determination of ics0s
of different compounds on each isoenzyme separately.
with this system we determined the inhibitory efficacy
of  xxxd3311xxx , aspirin and indomethacin on human
cyclooxygenase isoenzymes.

materials and methods
chemicals

 xxxd3311xxx  (4-hydroxy-2-methyl-n-(2-pyridyl)-2h-thieno[2,3-e]-l,2-thiazine-3 carboxamide 1,1-dioxide) was provided by f. hoffmann-la roche & co., basel, switzerland.
acetylsalieylic acid and indomethacin were purchased
from sigma chemical co., st louis, mo. a 25 mg/ml stock

solution in dimethylsulfoxide (dmso, fisher chemical,
new jersey) was prepared for both  xxxd3311xxx  and
 xxxd234xxx . a 10mg/ml stock solution was
prepared in dmso for indomethacin. the final concentration of dmso on the cell cultures was never higher than
40 gl/ml.
cell culture

cos-7 cells and nih 3t3 cells were grown on 100 mm
petri dishes (falcon, becton dickinson labware, lincoln
park, nj) in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (dmem,
sigma chemical co., st louis, mo) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (fbs, icn biomedicals, inc.,
aurora, oh), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin
(100 gg/ml), ph 7.4. for transfection, cos-7 cells were
grown in 6-well plates (falcon, becton dickinson labware,
lincoln park, nj).
isolation of total rna and northern blot analysis

total rna was extracted from 100 mm confluent plates
of cos-7 and nih 3t3 cells using trizol (gibco brl,
burlington, ont), according to the manufacturer's protocol. total rna (25 gg) was fractionated on an agaroseformaldehyde gel, and transferred to 0.45 gm hybond-n +
membrane (amersham life science inc., oalcville, ont) by
capillarity. human cox-1 (hcox-1) and human cox-2
( xxxg1884xxx ) edna probes were prepared by random primer
[32p]dctp with an oligolabeling kit (pharmacia biotech
inc., piscataway, nj). both cdnas were kindly supplied by
dr timothy hla. the membranes were hybridized in
hybridization buffer (400 mm nah2po4, 1 mm edta, 1
mg/ml bsa, 5%  xxxd3215xxx , 50% formamide,
ph 7.2) overnight at 42°c with the radioactive marked
probes, and then washed twice at 55°c for 20 rain in
1 mm edta, 0.1%  xxxd3215xxx , 1 x ssc (stock
solution 20x ssc: 3 m  xxxg2020xxx , 0.3 m sodium citrate, ph 7.0)
and then washed once at 55°c for 20 min in 1 mm edta,
0.1%  xxxd3215xxx , 0.2 x ssc. the membranes
were then autoradiographed on kodak xar-5 film at
-80°c with intensifying screens.  xxxg861xxx  edna probes
were used to allow comparison of the amounts of mrna
in each lane.
transient expression
once the cos-7 cells were at 60% to 75% of m a x i m u m

confluence, they were transfected with hcox-1 or
 xxxg1884xxx  cdnas inserted in pcdnai plasmids (invitrogen,
san diego, ca), a mammalian expression vector, using
an optimized lipofectaminetm reagent (gibco brl)
procedure. lipofectaminetm (5 gl per well) and plasmid

pge~ production was measured by radioimmunoassay
as previously described =s with minor modifications.
[5,6,8,11,12,14,15(n)-3h]pge2
was purchased
from
amersham life science inc., oakville, ont. standard pge=
and pge= antiserum were purchased from sigma
chemical co., st louis, mo. this antiserum does not
discriminate between  xxxd1903xxx ~ (pge~) and
 xxxd1903xxx ~ (pge~). the sensitivity of our ria is
defined as the 90% intercept of a b/bo standard curve
and was found to be 2 ng/ml. bound and free fractions
were separated by using dextran-coated charcoal and
centrifugation.
determination of ic~0
the ic~0 of the various compounds tested were calculated
by linear regression from semi-log plots using the results
comprised between 80% and 20% of pge~ production

and  xxxd3311xxx  for the inhibition of both hcox-1 and
 xxxg1884xxx  (table). none of the compounds tested w a s
specific for one of the isoenzymes. as can be seen in the
table,  xxxd3311xxx  and aspirin had icso cox-2/icso cox-1

the objective of our study was to develop a system
that would provide an efficient way to determine qualitative and quantitative characteristics of nsmd inhibition
for each h u m a n cyclooxygenase isoenzyme separately.
since b o t h isoenzymes are generally present in different
tissues and cell lines our approach was to find a m a m malian cell line that did not express either cox isoenzymes and transfect t h e m with the proper cdnas.
using nih 3t3 cells as positive controls for the northern
blots we determined that cos-7 cells, among all the
cell lines tested did not express either cox-1 or cox-2.
the absence of cyclooxygenase activity in these cells
was further confirmed by the absence of pge2 production
by either native or mock transfected cos-7 cells (data
not shown). this cell line was thus chosen for transient
transfection with h u m a n cox-1 or h u m a n cox-2 cdnas,
which would allow the expression and the testing of only
one isoenzyme at a time.
as shown b y the production of pge2 upon stimulation
with  xxxd208xxx , transfection of cos-7 cells with
hcox-1 or  xxxg1884xxx  cdnas yielded functional enzymes.
although both cdnas have the same length and were
transfected using the same vector, a difference in the
m a x i m u m production of pge2 by the two isoenzymes was
seen in our system, with hcox-1 producing six times
more pge 2 then  xxxg1884xxx . one reason for this difference
could be a decreased expression or activity of the
 xxxg1884xxx  isoenzyme. in fact, the reported sequence of the
cdna used in our transfections differs from two other
sequences of  xxxg1884xxx . 29,3° this punctual difference in
codon 165, gaa to gga, which replaces a glutamic
acid by a glycine was shown to cause a drop in enzyme
activity. 29 the low levels of pge2 production in our essays
prompted us to verify this nucleotide difference.
sequencing  xxxg1884xxx  cdna from codon 146 to codon 208
(data not shown) we verified that the sequence in codon
165 is gaa ( xxxd2431xxx ), the same as in the more
recent publications, 29,3° and not gga (glycine) as previ-

ously reported. 5 a punctual mutation in the cdna can
not, thus, explain the smaller activity of  xxxg1884xxx  when
compared to hcox-1 in our system. since our cox-2
cdna lacks the complete consensus kozak sequence in
the 5' untranslated region it is probable that a decreased
translation of cox-2 mrna occurs, what could explain
the lower activity of cox-2 per cell when compared to
cox-1. this hypothesis, however, remains to be tested.
the use of whole cells in our assays may present
some advantages over systems using microsomal preparations of the overexpressed enzymes, for the cell structure and metabolism are closer to the conditions found in
living systems. it is known that results of the inhibitory
activity of nsmds on cyclooxygenase using whole living
cells assays differ from results obtained in non-li~ng
systems, probably because penetration through cell
membranes plays a role in nsaid activity.31 mso, the
use of exogenous  xxxd208xxx  allows the control of
the quantity of substrate in the system, a parameter
that can not be controlled when whole cells are treated
with substances that stimulate pge2 production, such as
phorbol esters and interleukins. the possibility of controlling substrate availability is very important when
testing competitive inhibitors of cyclooxygenase22
another important aspect to consider when testing
cyclooxygenase inhibitors is the time-dependent mode of
action of some nsmds. it has been shown that the pharmacological profile of some of these drugs can change if
they are pre-incubated with the enzymes instead of being
added immediately before the assay, a~ since pre-incubation in vitro with nsmds seems to correspond better to
the in vivo situation, where patients are constantly
exposed to inhibitory concentrations of these drugs, we
chose to pre-incubate the cells with the nsmds tested
before the addition of  xxxd208xxx .
using this method we determined the inhibition of
hcox-1 and  xxxg1884xxx  by aspirin, indomethacin and
 xxxd3311xxx . all three compounds inhibited both isoenzymes. the values obtained for aspirin, a time dependent
and irreversible nsmd which acetylates both cox-1 and
cox-218,32 differ from those reported in the literature
concerning cox-2. in fact, the reported icso of aspirin
for cox-2 is between 50 and 210 gg/ml, 31,33that is, 90 to
300 times higher than the result found in the present
study. however, the results from the literature were
obtained in other systems that used cox-2 from different
species and different protocols, such as different incubation times (instantaneous inhibition and incubations of
2 min). 3~,34 some of these studies determined cyclooxygenase activity by oxygen consumption instead of
prostaglandin production24 in the case of aspirin, a system based on the consumption of oxygen would have a
different icso for cox-2 than a system based on pge2
production. the reason is that acetylation of  xxxg1884xxx 
© pearson professional ltd 1997

365

by aspirin does not inhibit oxygenase activity, but modifies this isoenzyme so that it produces 15-r-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-r-hete) instead of pge2.2°,35,3~
so, cox-2 inhibited by aspirin still consumes oxygen but
no longer produces pge2. in the case of cox-l, acetylation by aspirin completely inhibits cyclooxygenase activity,~7,38 and both systems are supposed to lead to similar
results. in fact, the results obtained in the present study
are comparable to the results reported in the literature for
cox-1. 3i'33'34 the different values obtained with aspirin
for human cox-2 could thus be explained on the basis of
differences between the technical protocols used and the
different species of cox. the results obtained with
indomethacin are comparable to those reported in the
literature for both cox-1 and c o x - 2 . 32'33
from the three compounds tested in the present study
 xxxd3311xxx  presents very close ics0s for hcox-1 and
 xxxg1884xxx . preliminary reports from other authors using
non-stimulated and lipopolysaccharide (lps) stimulated
guinea-pig macrophages as models of cox-1 and cox-2
containing cells, respectively, showed that the icsos of
 xxxd3311xxx  for cox-1 and cox-2 were 0.009 gg/ml and
0.1 1 gg/ml. 39 the problems concerning the interpretation
of results obtained from stimulated cells as models for
cox-2, which have been discussed above, and the different species used could explain the differences from the
results obtained in the present study.
on a molar basis  xxxd3311xxx  was the least potent of
the compounds tested for both hcox-1 and  xxxg1884xxx 
inhibition, followed by aspirin and indomethacin. this
finding, however, has little ff any therapeutical implication since all three compounds are capable of completely
inhibiting both isoenzymes in concentrations normally
found in the plasma during chronic administration. 4°,41
preferential inhibition of cox-2 may, based on theoretical and experimental data 17,42 lead to drugs with antiinflammatory action and reduced side effects. from this
point of view the ratio icso  xxxg1884xxx /icso hcox-1 is more
important than the absolute ics0s. when this ratio equals
1 for a certain compound a similar inhibition of both
enzymes is achieved with a given concentration of the
drug. with ratios higher than 1 hcox-1 is inhibited to a
greater extent than  xxxg1884xxx  and, inversely, ratios lower
than 1 indicate a preferential inhibition of  xxxg1884xxx . from
this perspective, and based on the present results,  xxxd3311xxx  compares advantageously with indomethacin and is
slightly better than aspirin, presenting one of the lowest
ics0  xxxg1884xxx /ics0 hcox-1 ratios from the nsmds
described in the literature; a¢29.39,42-44 this could explain
the smaller incidence of side effects in patients taking
 xxxd3311xxx .4o, 45
the need to standardize the testing of nsmds is evident. many factors can change the ics0 values of a nsmd,
such as the time of incubation, instantaneous inhibition
