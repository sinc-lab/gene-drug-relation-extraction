abstract adenylate forming enzymes play an important role in
nature as they are involved in a number of essential biochemical
pathways. in this study, we investigated the ability of a set of
structurally related recombinant bacterial adenylate forming enzymes derived from nonribosomal peptide synthetases for their
ability to synthesize acyl-coas in vitro. adenylation-domains
normally transfer their reactive aminoacyl-adenylates onto the
covalently attached 4 0 -phosphopantetheine moiety of small carrier proteins. in detail,  xxxg640xxx , dhbe, grsa-a, tycb3-a, and
tycc3-a were investigated for their ability to synthesize acylcoas. as reference, acetyl-coa-synthetase (acs) of b. subtilis
was utilized, which naturally synthesizes acetyl-coa from acetate,  xxxd1739xxx  and atp. interestingly, all enzymes were capable
of producing acyl-coas, albeit with diﬀering eﬃciencies. surprisingly, both  xxxd1739xxx  and atp were observed to inhibit the adenylation reaction at higher concentrations. product quantiﬁcation
for kinetic determination was carried out by esi-sim-ms.
our results allow speculation as to evolutionary relationships
within the large class of adenylate forming enzymes.

1. introduction
the family of adenylate forming enzymes is widely spread
in nature, including representatives such as trna-synthetases, fatty-acyl-coa-synthetases [1], acetyl-coa-synthetase
(acs) [2], ﬁreﬂy luciferase [3], and adenylation-domains (adomains) derived from nonribosomal peptide synthetases
(nrpss) [4,5]. characteristic of these enzymes is the ﬁrst
reaction step, the selective substrate recognition and activation as acyl-o-amp under adenosine 5 0 -triphosphate (atp)
consumption. the subsequent reaction step diﬀers signiﬁ-

cantly, however (see fig. 1). two diﬀerent strategies have
been applied in nature for the transfer of the reactive adenylated substrates: either to small molecules such as  xxxd1739xxx 
(acs or fatty-acyl-coa synthetases) or molecular oxygen
(luciferase), or to biopolymer acceptor molecules like trnas
(trna-synthetases) or in the case of a-domains peptidyl-carrier-proteins (pcps).
in addition to the mechanistic relationships within this group
of enzymes, many members also share high structural homology. for example, the overall folds of ﬁreﬂy luciferase [3] and
acs [2] are very similar to those of the nrps a-domains [6,7]
(compare fig. 2). in the case of the nrps a-domains, the combination of structural information and an abundance of sequence information led to the identiﬁcation of 10 amino acids
that form the substrate binding pocket [8], the so-called nonribosomal code, which contributed signiﬁcantly to deciphering
the substrate speciﬁcity of the a-domains. furthermore, adenylation domains are known to exhibit 10 core motifs (a1–a10)
which are highly conserved [9].
this conservation in structure, as well as the existence of further functional counterpart domains within polyketide and
fatty acid synthetases (such as acyl carrier proteins (acps),
corresponding to pcps) [10] suggests that this group of adenylate forming enzymes may share common ancestry in the primary metabolic synthesis of  xxxd2154xxx . indeed, it has been
shown that ﬁreﬂy luciferase is able to act as a long chain fatty
acyl coa synthetase [11] as well as being able to generate
luciferyl-coa [12].
the formation of aminoacyl-coas and aminoacyl-4 0 -phosphopantetheines catalyzed by trna-synthetases has been reported by jakubowski, who hypothesized that the present
day aminoacyl-trna-synthetases may have originated from
ancestral forms involved in non-coded thioester-dependent
peptide synthesis similar to the present day nrpss [13]. however, the structures of trna-synthetases diﬀer signiﬁcantly
from those of the a-domains [14].
in the present study, we have tested a set of six structurally related adenylate forming enzymes of diverse origin
(derived from the bacillibactin, gramicidin s and tyrocidine
nrps-systems of b. subtilis and b. brevis, respectively) for
their ability to synthesize acyl-coas in vitro: acs (which
naturally transfers acetate onto  xxxd1739xxx ), two stand-alone
a-domains,  xxxg640xxx  (involved in the d -alanylation of lipoteichoic acid) [15], dhbe (which activates 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate
for the synthesis of the siderophore bacillibactin) [16], and
three module integrated a-domains grsa-a (for the incorporation of phe in gramicidin s), tycb3-a and tycc3-a (incorporation of phe and tyr in tyrocidine, respectively) (see
fig. 3).

2. results and discussion
2.1. formation of acyl- xxxd1739xxx 
in this study, we tested a set of structurally related adenylate
forming enzymes of diverse origin for their ability to synthesize
acyl-coas in vitro. the single step aﬃnity puriﬁed enzymes
acs,  xxxg640xxx , dhbe, grsa-a, tycb3-a, and tycc3-a were
assayed with their cognate substrates (acetate, d-ala, 2,3dihydroxybenzoate, phe, phe, and tyr, respectively), atp
and  xxxd1739xxx . acs of b. subtilis, which transfers acetate naturally to  xxxd1739xxx  under atp consumption, was used as a reference. the other enzymes naturally transfer their activated

substrates onto the 4 0 -ppant moiety of speciﬁc carrier proteins.
interestingly, high performance liquid chromatography
(hplc)-ms analysis revealed the enzyme dependent synthesis
of the desired acyl-coas in all cases, but with diﬀerent rates.
to determine the kinetics of acyl-coa formation, it was necessary to quantify the increase of product in relation to the reaction time. due to a lack of suitable standards (the only relevant
commercially available acyl-coa is acetyl-coa and acylation
of coa with aromatic amino-acids would have a signiﬁcant
impact on the molar extinction coeﬃcient at 215 nm), product
quantiﬁcation by uv spectroscopy was deemed unsuitable.
therefore, we established an esi-ms-based sim-method for

comparison, the n-terminal domains are in equivalent orientations. positions of functionally equivalent residues, highlighted as small spheres, serve
to illustrate the rearrangements of the small domain: pink c-terminus (corresponding to residue gly536 in dhbe [7]); (i) light blue basic residue
involved in adenylation half-reaction (dhbe lys519) and (ii) yellow basic residue involved in thiolation half-reaction (dhbe lys439). (a) fireﬂy

sensitive and selective product quantiﬁcation, assuming that all
acyl-coas reveal similar ionization eﬃciencies under neutral
ph-conditions in the negative ion mode due to the negatively
charged phosphate groups of  xxxd1739xxx .
unexpectedly, the acyl-coa formation activity increased to
a certain  xxxd1739xxx  level in the reaction mixture and then continuously decreased at higher  xxxd1739xxx  concentrations for all
enzymes tested, indicating inhibition. the kinetic data for all
six enzymes are summarized in table 1.
as expected, the catalytic eﬃciency was highest for acs (kcat/
km 45 000 min1 m1). interestingly,  xxxg640xxx , a stand-alone adomain which belongs to the primary metabolism and is involved in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, showed the highest
activity within the remaining group of enzymes (kcat/km
31 min1 m1), three orders of magnitude less than that of
acs. the activity of dhbe (kcat/km 4 min1 m1), a standalone a-domain involved in the synthesis of the bacterial
siderophore bacillibactin in b. subtilis, was reduced by another
8-fold compared to  xxxg640xxx . the module integrated nrps a-domains revealed the lowest acylation activities for  xxxd1739xxx 
(tycb3-a kcat/km 1.3 min1 m1, tycc3-a kcat/km 0.3 min1
m1, and grsa-a kcat/km 0.02 min1 m1).
the main drawback to aminoacyl-coa synthesis of those
enzymes that do not normally utilize  xxxd1739xxx  as an acceptor
molecule is the observed inhibition caused by  xxxd1739xxx  itself.
at low  xxxd1739xxx  concentrations, substrate binding is insuﬃcient and at higher concentrations, the adenylation reaction
is inhibited. therefore we set out to analyse this observed inhibition in more detail.
2.2. inhibition kinetics of the adenylation reaction with  xxxd1739xxx 
as inhibitor
to verify the  xxxd1739xxx  inhibition of the acylation reaction
observed in the hplc-ms based acylation assays, the ppi-exchange assay was applied. the  xxxd1739xxx  concentrations in the
reaction mixtures were varied in the range of 10 lm to 40 mm.
the ki-values observed (table 1) were in the same ranges as

determined by the acylation assays (e.g. acs 1.7 vs. 1.9 mm
 xxxd1739xxx , and tycb3-a 12.6 vs. 7.1 mm  xxxd1739xxx ). the fact
that the ppi-exchange assay was also aﬀected by  xxxd1739xxx  at
higher concentrations indicates that the adenylation reaction
itself and not the transfer of the acyl-group from acyl-amp
to  xxxd1739xxx  is aﬀected.
comparing the structures of atp and  xxxd1739xxx , we hypothesized that atp-binding by the adenylation domains may be
inhibited by  xxxd1739xxx  in a competitive manner. consequently,
we tried to reduce this inhibitory eﬀect of  xxxd1739xxx  by increasing the atp concentration up to 25 mm at constant  xxxd1739xxx 
concentrations within the ppi exchange assay. most surprisingly, atp itself revealed an inhibitory eﬀect at higher
amounts. concentrations around 4 mm were observed to be
optimal. increasing atp concentrations resulted in reduced
adenylation activities.
thus, the inhibition observed by  xxxd1739xxx  is not due to competition for the atp-binding site. structural information has
established that the adenylate forming enzymes are composed
of two structural subdomains, with a ﬂexible linker peptide
and the active site sandwiched in between [2,3,6,7]. evidence
has been accumulating that the relative orientations of the subdomains are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent for the two half reactions
depicted in fig. 1a [2,17,18]. a 140° rotation of the c-terminal
domain reconﬁgures the active site from one allowing for adenylation to one for thiolation (compare fig. 2). it is therefore
possible that high concentrations of the thiol substrate (in this
case  xxxd1739xxx ) could force the c-terminal domain into the
‘thiolation’ orientation, thereby inhibiting the adenylation
reaction. the mechanism of inhibition of the adenylation reaction by atp remains unclear, however.
2.3. evidence for the evolutionary process of adenylate forming
enzymes
summarizing the kinetic data observed in this study, one
may speculate about the evolutionary process of the large class
of adenylate forming enzymes. the results presented here

fig. 3. the origins of the enzymes utilized in this study are shown. adenylate forming enzymes or domains are shown in red. (a) acs is a stand-alone
adenylate forming enzyme, which transfers naturally acetate onto  xxxd1739xxx . (b)  xxxg640xxx  is involved in cell wall biosynthesis of b. subtilis. it naturally
activates d -ala and transfers it to dltc, a peptidyl-carrier protein (pcp). (c) dhbe is involved in the initiation of bacillibactin synthesis, a
siderophore of b. subtilis. the substrate of this stand-alone a-domain is 2,3-dhb, which is activated and subsequently transferred onto the arylcarrier protein (arcp) domain of dhbb. (d) tycb3-a and tycc3-a originate from elongation modules of the tyrocidine synthetase of b. brevis.
(e) grsa-a is the adenylation domain of the initiation module of tyrocidine biosynthesis.

together with the structural data known so far seem to provide
some evidence that the nrps a-domains may have evolved
from an ancestral form of adenylate forming enzymes that utilized  xxxd1739xxx  as a small acceptor molecule for their synthe-

sized reactive adenylates. this is indicated by the fact that
 xxxg640xxx , a stand-alone enzyme involved in primary metabolism
of bacteria, shows the highest activity for acylation of  xxxd1739xxx  (kcat/km 31 min1 m1) after acs. similarly, the standalone a-domain dhbe is also able to acylate  xxxd1739xxx  at a
reduced rate (kcat/km 4 min1 m1), possibly reﬂecting a
divergence of function required for its role in secondary metabolism. finally, the a-domains integrated in nrps-modules
(grsa-a, tycb3-a and tycc3-a) seem to have diverged the
furthest, with only a residual activity towards  xxxd1739xxx . these
enzymes seem to have adapted to a dedicated role in the nrps
assembly line, speciﬁcally recognizing the 4 0 -phosphopantheinyl moiety attached to their cognate pcps. this is also reﬂected by a phylogenetic comparison of acs,  xxxg640xxx , dhbe,
tycb3-a, tycc3-a, and grsa-a with other bacterial adenylation domains as shown in fig. 4. although acs shows an overall identity to adenylation domains of 20% and exhibits similar

diﬀers from the other enzymes. also  xxxg640xxx  (stand alone a-domain of
primary metabolism) and dhbe (stand alone a-domain of secondary
metabolism) cluster separately and near to acs, indicating that they are
more similar to acs than the other ones. this correlates well with the
biochemical data gained within this study.

clearly separates from the other enzymes within the phylogenetic tree. also  xxxg640xxx  and dhbe cluster separately and near
to acs, indicating that they are more similar to acs than the
other ones which are nrps module integrated.

3. experimental
cloning of the recombinant peptide synthetase genes, protein overproduction and puriﬁcation of the his6-tagged proteins has been
described previously [6,15,19,20]. puriﬁcation after single step ni2+aﬃnity chromatography was conﬁrmed by sds–page. the protein
concentrations were assigned using the calculated extinction coeﬃ-

cients for the a280 of the enzymes as follows (grsa-aphe
64 060 m1 cm1, dhbe-adhb 60 460 m1 cm1, tycc4-aval 41 870
m1 cm1, dltad -ala 49 650 m1 cm1, acsacetate 126 530 m1 cm1,
tycb3-aphe 58 370 m1 cm1, tycc3-atyr 54 770 m1 cm1).
3.1. atp-ppi exchange reaction
adenylation domain inhibition kinetics for  xxxd1739xxx  and atp
were examined by applying the atp-ppi-exchange assay as described
previously [21]. for inhibition kinetics, the concentrations of
 xxxd1739xxx  or atp in the assay mixtures were varied in the range of
10–40 mm.
3.2.  xxxd1739xxx  acylation assay
enzymes (ﬁnal concentrations 10 lm except acs (1 lm), and  xxxg640xxx 
(5.7 lm)) were incubated at 37 °c in assay buﬀer (50 mm hepes,
100 mm nacl, 1 mm ethylendiamintetraacetic acid, 10 mm mgcl2,
ph 7.5) with 4 mm atp, 1 mm substrate (amino)-acids and varying
concentrations of coa. the assays were quenched at distinct time
points by the addition of 20% tfa, incubated on ice (5 min) and centrifuged (13 000 rpm, 2 min). the supernatant was subsequently transferred to hplc-vials and directly measured, due to the very slow
hydrolysis of thioesters even under acidic conditions.
3.3. hplc-ms method for identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of
acyl-coas
separation of the reaction products was achieved on a 250/2-nucleodur-c18-pyramid reversed phase column by applying the following
gradient at a ﬂow rate of 0.3 ml min1 (buﬀer a: 2 mm triethylamine/water; buﬀer b: 2 mm triethylamine/80% acetonitrile/20% water
(v/v)): loading 5% buﬀer b, after 5 min linear gradient up to 30% buﬀer
b in 20 min, followed by a linear gradient up to 95% buﬀer b in 4 min,
and then holding 100% buﬀer b for 2 min. the products were identiﬁed
by uv detection at 215 nm and by on-line esi-ms analysis with an
agilent 1100 msd in the negative sim-mode (sim, single ion monitoring).
an internal standard is normally required for quantiﬁcation with
ms. acetyl-coa (which is commercially available and structurally related to the formed products) was therefore used as internal standard.
as we observed that the ion source of the agilent 1100 msd was very
stable over several days, acetyl-coa was used as an external standard.
the calibration with acetyl-coa was veriﬁed several times during the
measurements.
3.4. calculation of kinetic data
the kinetic data were calculated with the single substrate model of
the enzyme kinetics module of sigmaplot (version 8.0, spss science
inc.). the michaelis–menten/uncompetitive inhibition model was
found to ﬁt the experimental data best. due to the substrate inhibition
observed, however, the ﬁtted km and kcat values are only computed
theoretical values and consequently exhibit quite high margins of error.
we therefore decided only to state the determined catalytic eﬃciencies
(km/kcat; table 1).
