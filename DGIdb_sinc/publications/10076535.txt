abstract.  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate is used frequently, alone or in combination with other antitumor agents,
for the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer.  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate is metabolically activated in
vivo, and its metabolites,  xxxd2041xxx , estromustine, estrone, and  xxxd2037xxx  inhibit the assembly of
microtubules [for review see: kreis w, in: concepts, mechanisms, and new targets for chemotherapy (ed. muggia
fm), pp. 163–184. kluwer academic publishers, boston, 1995]. we investigated, by displacement of
[3h]methyltrienolone in the presence of 2.5 mm of  xxxd3418xxx , the binding of  xxxd2041xxx 
phosphate and its metabolites,  xxxd2041xxx , estromustine, estrone, and  xxxd2037xxx , as well as other antiandrogen
agents including a-estradiol,  xxxd334xxx , and hydroxyflutamide, to the mutated  xxxg183xxx  (m-ar) in
lncap cells and to the wild-type  xxxg183xxx  in wild-type ar cdna expression plasmid (w-par0)
cdna-transfected hela cells. analogous to the antiandrogens,  xxxd334xxx  and hydroxyflutamide, binding of
 xxxd2041xxx  phosphate metabolites to the  xxxg183xxx  was observed. the ec50 values (in mm) were:
 xxxd2041xxx  phosphate, .10;  xxxd2041xxx , 3.129 6 0.312; estromustine; 2.612 6 0.584; estrone, 0.800 6
0.090; a-estradiol, 1.051 6 0.096;  xxxd2037xxx , 0.523 6 0.028;  xxxd334xxx , 4.920 6 0.361; and hydroxyflutamide, 0.254 6 0.012. the transactivation assay demonstrated that, analogous to  xxxd334xxx ,  xxxd2041xxx 
could not induce luciferase activity in either w-par0 or m-parl transfected hela cells. in contrast, a strong
induction of the reporter activity by dihydrotestosterone was observed. down-regulation of prostate-specific
antigen (psa) expression, an ar-target gene, by  xxxd2041xxx  and  xxxd334xxx  was accompanied by the
blockade of the mutated  xxxg183xxx . exposure of lncap cells to  xxxd2041xxx  for 24 hr caused
transcriptional inhibition of psa in a concentration-dependent manner. the levels of psa mrna decreased
56 and 90% when lncap cells were treated with 5 and 10 mm of  xxxd2041xxx , respectively (ic50 5 10.97 6
1.68 mm). binding of hydroxyflutamide to m-ar in lncap cells resulted in a concentration-dependent
stimulation of psa expression, suggesting that hydroxyflutamide acted as an agonist of the m-ar. our data
indicate that  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate metabolites perform as androgen antagonists of ar, an additional
mechanism involved in the therapeutic effect of  xxxd2041xxx  phosphate in patients with prostate cancer.

the diagnosis of prostate cancer has increased markedly
over the last decade, perhaps due to early detection. the
expected new cases in the u.s.a. for 1997 were estimated
to be 341,000 [1], a number substantially higher than the
expected incidence of breast cancer in females or of lung
cancer. the expected death rate from this disease is below
the number of breast and lung cancer deaths expected for
1997; however, because the incidence of prostate cancer
increases with age, the number of both newly diagnosed
cases and deaths will continue to increase as the population
ages.

emp† (emcytt) is a compound widely used, alone or in
combination with other antitumor agents, for the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer [2]. the mechanism of action of eam, the dephosphorylated metabolite,
was found to be distinct from that of its constituents,
b-edo and nor-nitrogen mustard [3]. because a large
excess of eam failed to compete with dht binding to the
specific ar of rat ventral prostate, investigators concluded

that eam did not bind to the ar [4]. inhibition of the
assembly of microtubule proteins, preventing the formation
of properly functional microtubules, was reported for emp
in 1987 [5] and for eam in 1988 [6]. binding of eam to
microtubules was reported shortly thereafter [7]. further
evidence for a nonclassical hormone effect is the cytotoxic
effect of this agent in cell lines. emp demonstrated substantial in vitro antitumor activity in the hormone-sensitive
lncap and the hormone-resistant lncapr cell lines [8], as
well as in hormone-resistant du 145 and pc 3 cells [9, 10].
antiandrogens exert their effects on target tissue by
blocking androgen binding to the ar. because the metabolites of emp also include, besides its dephosphorylated
product eam, eom, b-edo, and eo [11, 12], we considered it likely that some of these estrogen relatives might
also bind to the ar and thus serve as androgen antagonists.
this hypothesis would explain the increased sensitivity of
lncap cells to emp compared with other cell lines. the
present study explored this possibility and compared the
binding of these molecules to the m-ar and w-ar.
materials and methods
reagents
[3h] xxxd2631xxx  and unlabeled  xxxd2631xxx  were purchased from new
england nuclear. emp, eam, eom, a- and b-edo, and
eo were gifts from pharmacia through the courtesy of dr.
b. hartley-asp.  xxxd334xxx  and hydroxyflutamide were
gifts from zeneca pharmaceuticals and the schering corp.,
respectively.  xxxd3418xxx  and other chemicals
were purchased from the sigma chemical co. w-par0,
m-parl and the reporter-plasmid gre-tk-luc were provided by dr. albert o. brinkmann.
cell culture
the prostatic carcinoma cell lines lncap, pc 3, and
du-145, and the human cervical adenocarcinoma hela
cells were purchased from the american type culture
collection. cells were cultured under conditions as described previously [13].
m-ar binding assays in lncap cells
lncap cells grown to 75– 85% confluence were harvested,
and 5 3 105 cells were reincubated for 4 hr in rpmi 1640
medium containing 10% fbs at 37° with 0.5 nm of
[3h] xxxd2631xxx  (0.25 mci) at which concentration the binding
of  xxxd2631xxx  to m-ar was saturated. to eliminate possible
interference with other steroid receptors, 2.5 mm of  xxxd3418xxx  was added to the culture medium.
competition experiments of m-ar binding in lncap cells
between [3h] xxxd2631xxx  and emp or its metabolites, eam,
eom, eo, and b-edo, or the antiandrogens  xxxd334xxx 
and hydroxyflutamide were performed by adding various
concentrations of those agents to the culture medium.
subsequently, cells were incubated for 4 hr at 37°. unla-

beled  xxxd2631xxx  was used as positive control. after the incubation, the cells were collected on glass filters (whatman
labsales) and washed three times with pbs. the labeled
product was evaluated in a b-scintillation tri-carb 300
spectrophotometer (packard instruments). each experiment was repeated three times with triplicate samples. the
rba was calculated from competitive binding curves [14]
and expressed as the ratio of the concentration of unlabeled
compounds versus the concentration of  xxxd2631xxx  required to
inhibit the binding of [3h] xxxd2631xxx  by 50% (see table 1).
the rba value of unlabeled  xxxd2631xxx  was set at 100%.
w-ar binding assay in transfected hela cells
the w-ar assay was performed in hela cells co-transfected
with wild-type ar expression plasmid (w-par0) and
reporter-plasmid gre-tk-luc [15]. the transfection was
carried out using standard calcium phosphate precipitation
methods [16], and the efficiency of the transfection was
monitored by the luciferase activity (promega assay systems). briefly, 3 3 105 hela cells in rpmi 1640 medium
containing 10% fbs were sown in 10-cm dishes and
incubated at 37° for 24 hr. w-par0 cdna (10 mg) and
gre-tk-luc cdna (2 mg) in 125 mm of cacl2–hepes
buffer (0.14 m of nacl, 0.05 m of hepes acid, 1.5 mm of
na2hpo4, ph 7.05) were added to the culture and incubated for 16 hr. the precipitates were washed out with
prewarmed pbs and refed with fresh rpmi 1640 medium
containing 10% fbs. after incubation of the transfected
cells for an additional 32 hr at 37°, the cells were harvested
for ar binding assay as described above.
for the transactivation assay, various concentrations of
dht, eam,  xxxd334xxx , and hydroxyflutamide were
added to the cultures after 24-hr cotransfection of w-par0
or m-parl with reporter-plasmid gre-tk-luc, and the
cells were incubated for an additional 24 hr. then cells
were harvested, and the cell extracts were used for luciferase
activity assay as described above.
northern blotting assay
lncap grown to 65–75% confluence in rpmi 1640
medium containing 10% fbs were exposed for 24 hr to
various concentrations of eam, or  xxxd334xxx  or hydroxyflutamide. the cells were harvested and washed with
cold pbs, and total rna was extracted; the northern
blotting assay was performed as described previously [17].
results
the specificity of the simplified method described was
established by comparing the binding of [3h] xxxd2631xxx  in the
presence of 2.5 mm of  xxxd3418xxx  to the
m-ar in lncap cells, the w-ar in transfected hela cells
(par-hela), and the ar negative cell lines (pc-3 and
du145) as well as nontransfected hela cells. as shown in

hydroxyflutamide, the emp metabolites, eam, eom, eo,
and, b-edo, as well as a-edo, showed significant binding
to the m-ar in a concentration-dependent manner (fig.
2). the sequence of the affinity of these metabolites to
m-ar in lncap cells, as determined by their ec50 values,
as outlined in table 1, was: b-edo (0.523 6 0.028 mm) .
eo (0.800 6 0.090 mm) . a-edo (1.051 6 0.096 mm) .
eom (2.612 6 0.584 mm) . eam (3.129 6 0.312 mm).
all of the emp metabolites showed stronger binding than
that of  xxxd334xxx  (ec50: 4.920 6 0.361 mm) but weaker
binding than hydroxyflutamide (ec50: 0.254 6 0.012 mm).
poor binding of emp to the m-ar was observed (.10
mm).
as shown in figs. 2 and 3, and table 1, the binding of
b-edo to w-ar was slightly weaker than that to the
m-ar. the rba values of b-edo and eo were 2.524 and
1.650 to the m-ar and 1.29 and 1.11 to w-ar, respectively
(p , 0.05). no significant differences of the rba values
between m-ar and w-ar for eam and eo were observed.
to explore whether emp metabolites compete with
androgens for receptor binding, a transactivation assay was
carried out. hela cells were cotransfected with either
w-par0 or m-parl and an androgen responsive reporter
plasmid, gre-tk-luc. twenty-four hours after the transfection, various concentrations of eam,  xxxd334xxx  and
hydroxyflutamide, as well as dht, were added to the
cultures. transactivation of luciferase activity by dht was
observed in both w- and m-par transfected cells in a
concentration-dependent manner (fig. 4). hydroxyflutamide showed a slight induction of the luciferase activity in
w-par transfected cells and a moderate induction in
m-parl transfected cells. in contrast, eam analogues to
 xxxd334xxx  could not induce enzyme activity in either
w-par0 or m-parl transfected cells (fig. 4a). moreover,
at ec50 of the receptor binding, almost 50% of the induced
luciferase activity by 10 nm dht in both w-par0 and
m-parl transfected cells was blocked by eam and  xxxd334xxx . under the same conditions, dht-induced enzy-

‡rba: relative binding affinity. the rba value of  xxxd2631xxx  was set at 100. the absolute values of controls in mutated lncap cells and w-par0
transfected hela cells were 15,240 and 9,680 cpm, respectively, that were used in the calculation of rba.

matic activity blocked by hydroxyflutamide was only 28%
in w-par0 and 14% in m-parl (fig. 4c). these data
indicate that eam, a major metabolite of emp, acts as an
androgen antagonist.
to verify the antagonistic effect of eam, the effects of
eam,  xxxd334xxx , or hydroxyflutamide on the expression
of psa, a native ar-targeted gene [18, 19], were evaluated
further by northern blotting. as shown in fig. 5, analogous
to  xxxd334xxx , exposure of lncap cells to eam for 24 hr
caused a dramatic decrease of psa transcription in a
concentration-dependent manner. the levels of psa
mrna decreased 56 and 90% when lncap cells were
treated with 5 and 10 mm of eam (ic50 5 10.97 6 1.68
mm in lncap cells), confirming that emp metabolites
serve as androgen antagonists to m-ar. in contrast, bind-

ing of hydroxyflutamide to m-ar in lncap cells resulted
in a moderate concentration-dependent stimulation of psa
expression, consistent with the results shown above.
discussion
the effects of steroids on target cells are mediated by their
respective receptors. after binding of the hormone, these
ligand-dependent transcription factors activate their target
genes by tightly and selectively binding to areas of hormone
responsive elements in the target genes [20 –22].
ar is a member of the superfamily of ligand-dependent
transcription factors that comprise receptors for retinoids,
thyroid hormones, and steroids [20, 22]. the binding of ar
to the hormone responsive element of its targeted genes is

an essential step of transcriptional activation. we have
shown that down-regulation of psa by finasteride, a
5a-reductase inhibitor, is accompanied by inhibition of
complex formation between ar and the steroid receptor
binding consensus ( xxxg377xxx ) in the promoter of the psa
gene [19] in mutated ar (codon 868) of lncap cells [23,
24]. dht has been shown to stimulate significantly the

1431

expression of psa in lncap cells [25, 26]. however,
androgen antagonists usually compete with agonists for
receptor binding without permitting the receptor to stimulate transcriptional activity [20, 21].
we previously demonstrated that psa plays a role in the
growth stimulation of the androgen responsive prostate
cancer cell line lncap [13]. in this study, we have shown
that emp metabolites, such as eam, eom, eo, and
b-edo significantly bind to both m-ar and w-ar, but
that eam could not induce w-par- or m-par-mediated
luciferase reporter gene transactivation. in addition, eam
inhibited expression of the native ar-target gene psa in
ar-mutated lncap cells. these data indicate that emp
metabolites act, at least partially, as androgen antagonists,
a new mechanism of action for this agent. this conclusion
is also supported by previous observations where lncap
cells were more sensitive to both eam and eom than were
the hormone-independent cell lines, pc-3 and du145
[compared the ic50 value of eom in lncap (9.73 mm),
with those in du-145 (65.62 mm), and pc-3 (74.20 mm)]
[8, 10].
the metabolism of steroid hormones in lncap cells was
investigated by schuurmans et al. [27]. of the five steroids
investigated (progesterone, b-edo, triamcinolone,  xxxd2631xxx ,
and dht), only dht was metabolized. even if the metabolism of eam does occur to some extent in the human
prostatic tumor cell line 1013 l [28], it is unlikely that the
emp metabolites investigated in our study are further
metabolized by lncap cells, because the major site of
metabolism for steroids is the liver [11, 12].
the binding of hydroxyflutamide to m-ar in lncap
cells was found to be approximately 16 times higher than
that of  xxxd334xxx . this finding is in contrast to the
binding of these two compounds to w-ar in w-par
transfected cos-n cells, where a similar rba value of
these two drugs was observed [29]. this may have clinical
relevance. for estradiol, similar relative ar binding to
m-ar was reported by veldscholte et al. [24] and taplin et
al. [30].
recent studies suggest that the mutations of the ar may
change the characteristics of some ar blockers, such as
hydroxyflutamide,  xxxd2725xxx ,  xxxd1786xxx , estradiol, and progesterone, from antagonists to agonists. these
agents can compete with androgens to bind to m-ar, but
have also been reported to stimulate cell growth and
excretion of psa [11, 21, 24, 29 –31]. our data demonstrated that emp metabolites, such as eam and eom (data
not shown) as well as  xxxd334xxx  significantly inhibited
psa gene expression in m-ar lncap cells. these metabolites could not induce reporter gene activity in either
w-par0 or m-parl transfected hela cells (figs. 4 and 5).
these data indicate that those agents still exhibit their
antagonistic effects on both m-ar and w-ar, which
distinguish them from hydroxyflutamide and b-edo. similar results for transcription activation in w- and m-par
transfected cells were reported by berrevoets et al. [29],
veldscholte et al. [24], and yeh et al. [31].

the discrepancy in bioactivities of  xxxd334xxx  and
hydroxyflutamide observed in this study indicates the need
for caution in therapy with antiandrogens for prostate
cancer patients. it is possible that ars mutated at various
codons might further complicate the choice of treatment
and might further evoke paradoxical responses to the
treatment. screening procedures using new molecular targets might allow a more rational approach to the treatment
of this disease with antiandrogens.
