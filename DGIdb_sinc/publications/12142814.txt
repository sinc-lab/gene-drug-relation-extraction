abstract
objectives: medical treatment of tyrosinemia i relies on the
herbicide ntbc [orfadin娂;  xxxd2735xxx ], an inhibitor of plant and mammalian
2-oxoacid-utilizing dioxygenases with a collective catalytic
cycle (‘hag’ mechanism). we hypothesize that ntbc-treated
tyrosinemia i is a human model for the pathogenic role of two
major enzymes in this class,  xxxg1071xxx  ( xxxg1071xxx ;  xxxg147xxx .27) and prolyl 4-hydroxylase
(p4-h; e.c. 1.14.11.2), essential for tyrosine and collagen metabolism, respectively.
methods: in a patient with established tyrosinemia i, we monitored the in vivo activities of  xxxg1071xxx  and p4-h via five biomarkers before and during ntbc medication. hypothesis testing at the molecular level was performed by computational
modeling of ntbc binding to the crystal structure-derived active site of  xxxg1071xxx , and then relating these findings to our
experimental results and to known p4-h data.

results: ntbc rapidly normalized the biomarkers for  xxxg1071xxx 
activity. however, those for p4-h activity remained uniformly
elevated after one hundred days on ntbc, the piiinp biomarker even increasing above its grossly abnormal, initial level.
this selective enzyme inhibition despite a collective catalytic
cycle is attributed to the conformation of ntbc, which only
fits the active site of  xxxg1071xxx , as confirmed by its crystal structure.
conclusions: normalization of hepatic collagen formation,
highly desirable in all fibrotic liver diseases, is not achieved by
ntbc in tyrosinemia i. by establishing the molecular cause for
this failure, our results also establish a rational approach to
identify inhibitors that achieve that goal, either by joint
 xxxg1071xxx  / p-4h inhibition, or by inhibition of only p-4h.

introduction

indispensable for collagen synthesis in general.  xxxg1071xxx 
and p4-h are non-heme iron enzymes, and each consumes one molecule of atmospheric oxygen and one
2-oxoacid moiety while hydroxylating one carbon atom.
 xxxg1071xxx  and p-4h have long been classified together as
2-oxoacid-utilizing dioxygenases (1), and therefore tyrosinemia i ranks as a model for human diseases mediated
by this class of enzymes, diseases that prominently include all fibrotic conditions. a single, collective catalytic
pathway—the ‘hag’ mechanism, proposed in 1982 by
hanauske-abel and günzler—resolves the substrate
alignment, catalytic orbital interactions, and product release of the 2-oxoacid-utilizing dioxygenases (2–4), and
has been extremely useful for the discovery of inhibitors
and candidate drugs targeting these enzymes (5,6). as
expected, the hag mechanism-utilizing enzymes display a remarkable cross-species susceptibility to such
inhibitors; e.g., human and plant  xxxg1071xxx  are similarly

tyrosinemia i, a recessively inherited disease that profoundly disrupts liver and kidney function, is caused by
the deficiency of  xxxg759xxx  (ec
3.7.1.2). the pathogenesis of potentially lethal liver
damage in tyrosinemia i involves, however, two additional enzymes:  xxxg1071xxx 
( xxxg1071xxx ;  xxxg147xxx .27), which forms the actual hepatotoxins; and prolyl 4-hydroxylase (p-4h; e.c.
1.14.11.2), required for the reactive hepatic fibrosis and

sensitive to the cyclohexanetrione class of plant growth
retardants (7,8). the cyclohexanetrione herbicides also
inhibit other 2-oxoacid-utilizing dioxygenases in plants,
such as the hydroxylases essential for synthesis of gibberellin hormones (9,10). like human p-4h, the gibberellin hydroxylases use the 2-oxoacid moiety of
2-oxoglutarate (4).
in children with tyrosinemia i, one of these herbicides
is used therapeutically to inhibit  xxxg1071xxx , thus suppressing formation of the hepatotoxins maleylacetoacetate, fumarylacetoacetate, and their saturated derivatives (11).
introduced in 1992, this agent, 2-(2-nitro-4trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-cyclohexane-1,3-dione or
ntbc (orfadin娂; swedish orphan international ab,
harpenden/united kingdom), has benefited several hundred tyrosinemia i patients and has changed at least the
time frame for liver transplantation, presently still the
definitive treatment (12,13). however, until now no specific consideration was given to any inhibitory effect
ntbc might exert on other 2-oxoacid-utilizing dioxygenases in humans, or to its mode of binding to  xxxg1071xxx ,
the basis for its clinical utility.
we hypothesized that treatment of tyrosinemia i with
ntbc allows to assess the simultaneous inhibition of
 xxxg1071xxx  and p4-h in vivo. we monitored surrogate biomarkers for the activity of either enzyme in a patient with
established tyrosinemia i, and prospectively measured
these parameters for the first 100 days of ntbc administration. only the  xxxg1071xxx  biomarkers normalized. we
present evidence that our empirical observations in this
single case actually are due to a general biologic factor,
the distinct difference between the active site topography
of  xxxg1071xxx  and of p4-h.
materials and methods
experimental design and assays used in the
clinical investigation
the investigation used irb-approved protocols that form an
integral part of the children’s clinical research center
(ccrc) at the weill medical college of cornell university.
measurements of the matrix biomarkers as well as the molecular modeling of 4- xxxd40xxx  and 2-(2-nitro-4trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-cyclohexane-1,3-dione were conducted in the connective tissue core laboratory of the ccrc
(director: h.m. hanauske-abel, md phd).
a total of ten biomarkers were monitored from just before
initiation of ntbc medication to up to 103 days of treatment,
generating a total of 60 data points.  xxxg1071xxx  activity was assessed by excretion of succinylacetoacetate and succinylacetone, metabolic derivatives of the  xxxg1071xxx  product homogentisic acid, and by  xxxd148xxx  in urine. in plasma, methionine and succinylacetone, and in serum ␣-fetoprotein also
were quantified. these indices were determined by standard
methods (11). p4-h activity was assessed via specific antigens
released from three different groups of collagens, all of which
are substrates for this enzyme. these biomarkers, quantified by

j pediatr gastroenterol nutr, vol. 35, no. 1, july 2002

specific radioimmunoassays, consisted of piiinp, an indicator
for the fibril-forming collagen type iii; nc1, a marker for the
sheet-forming collagen type iv; and ntd, an indicator for the
beaded filament-forming collagen type vi. the p1 antigen,
derived from the non-collagenous protein laminin and thus not
dependent on p4-h activity, served as control.

study subject
in an adopted child with unknown family history, tyrosinemia i was diagnosed at age 4 months. symptoms at presentation included: failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, rickets,
coagulopathy, and fanconi’s syndrome. because of the coagulopathy, a liver biopsy was not performed at that time. the
diagnosis of tyrosinemia i was confirmed by the measurement
of  xxxg759xxx  ( xxxg759xxx ) activity in blood
and by the presence of abnormal levels of tyrosine and tyrosine
metabolites in serum and urine. managed exclusively by nutritional therapy, the patient developed along the 25th percentile
for weight and the 5th percentile for height, but experienced a
tyrosinemic neurologic crisis at age 3 years, with severe muscle
weakness in the lower extremities and areflexia. orfadin娂
treatment commenced at age 10 years at a dose of 10 mg po
bid.
once tyrosinemia i was established biochemically, the need
for a liver biopsy was less pressing as the clinical status was
assessed on the basis of liver function parameters and, later, the
response to ntbc. however, hepatic imaging studies, which
included magnetic resonance, ultrasound, and computerized tomography, uniformly document marked parenchymal inhomogeneity, reflective of fibrosis with regenerative nodules, or focal lesions in a cirrhotic liver (14). portal hypertension has
evolved and is evidenced by splenomegaly and hypersplenism,
as well as by collateral circulation and a caput medusa pattern
demonstrated by doppler ultrasound (15).

computational analysis of molecules
the sequences for  xxxg1071xxx  of h. sapiens (accession #
aac73008) and p. fluorescens (accession # 1cjxa) were
aligned using the clustalw algorithm of macvector (oxford
molecular, madison, wi) to identify the active site segments
and quantify their degree of conservation. the only publicly
available crystal structure coordinates for 2-oxoacid-utilizing
dioxygenases were downloaded from the pdb database under
locator 1cjx [ xxxg1071xxx  of p. fluorescens (16)] and under locator 1rxg [deactoxycephalosporin c synthase of s. clavuligerus (17)]; the latter provides the representative coordinates
for the alignment of the atmospheric oxygen and the 2-oxoacid
substrates at the non-heme iron of these enzymes. threedimensional images of the active site of  xxxg1071xxx  were developed with the msi insightii software package (molecular
simulations inc., san diego, ca). the  xxxg1071xxx  substrate
4- xxxd40xxx  (4-hpp) and the  xxxg1071xxx  inhibitor
2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-cyclohexane-1,3-dione
(ntbc) were modeled and optimized using macspartan plus
(wavefunction inc., irvine, ca), and then exported as pdb
files into msi insightii.

results and discussion
it is well-established that the in vivo activity of the
2-oxoacid utilizing dioxygenases  xxxg1071xxx  and p4-h,

tyrosinemia i, a model for human diseases
which both use the hag mechanism for catalysis, is
directly reflected by their specific biomarkers. to assess
 xxxg1071xxx  activity, two deleterious metabolites of the enzyme’s product homogentisic acid, i.e., succinylacetone
and succinylacetoacetate, have been measured in biologic fluids (11,13). to assess p4-h activity, several
collagen-derived antigens have been employed. since all
collagen molecules depend on p4-h -synthesized hydroxyproline residues to stabilize their triple helix (18),
inhibition of p4-h renders helix formation impossible
(4,5). in the case of fibrillar collagens like type iii, the
underhydroxylated non-helical material is retained and
degraded intracellularly (19), and p4-h inhibition in cell
culture (20) or in patients (4,21) therefore causes a
marked and rapid decrease in biomarkers levels. in the
case of sheet-forming collagens like type iv, the underhydroxylated non-helical material may be secreted,
whereupon it fails to incorporate into matrix and is degraded extracellularly (22,23). these collagen typespecific consequences of p4-h inhibition suggested the
use of several, collagen-type specific biomarkers, i.e., of
nc1 and ntd in addition to piiinp. the serum concentration of each of these biomarkers, derived from collagens type iii, type iv, and type vi, respectively, also is
known to be directly related to, and markedly increases
with, fibrotic liver disease (24–26). the p1 antigen of
laminin, the major matrix protein that lacks hydroxyproline residues and in culture is secreted normally even as
p4-h is completely inhibited (23), was measured as control parameter.
in the tyrosinemic patient, the biomarkers for  xxxg1071xxx 
activity promptly decreased upon initiation of ntbc
treatment. initially elevated to more than ten-fold its
physiological level, the excretion of succinylacetoacetate
normalized within two weeks. the grossly increased
plasma concentration of succinylacetone also fell, although more gradually, and stabilized in the normal
range after two months of treatment (fig. 1). our observations are consistent with the previously reported effect
of ntbc on these biomarkers for the activity of human
 xxxg1071xxx , and confirm the distinctly different kinetics of
their response (11).
the biomarkers for p4-h activity were all entirely
unresponsive to ntbc, however (fig. 1). the levels of
piiinp, nc1, and ntd, documented before initiation of
treatment, ranged at the minimum 1.6 multiples above
the age-related medians, and as such revealed an active
fibrogenic process in the patient’s liver (24–26). these
initially abnormal levels remained consistently elevated
throughout the three months of the study period and were
unaffected by the administration of ntbc, although in
humans, effective p4-h inhibition causes the biomarkers
for at least the fibrillar collagens to decrease within a few
days (4,21). in fact, all the biomarkers for collagenous
and therefore p4-h-dependent proteins, i.e., piiinp,
nc1, and ntd, were consistently just as unresponsive to
ntbc treatment as the non-collagenous and therefore

p4-h-independent protein laminin, assessed via its p1
antigen (fig. 1). after 103 days on ntbc, all the biomarkers for  xxxg1071xxx  activity had normalized, averaging
3% of their initial values, whereas the piiinp biomarker
for p4-h activity displayed a distinct increase to 1.25
times its pre-ntbc level, or three times the upper limit
of normal. the other p4-h biomarkers also did not just
fail to decrease, but showed a similar, though smaller rise
over their initial, abnormally elevated values, nc1 and
ntd both increasing by a factor of 1.1. after 273 days
on ntbc, piiinp had increased even further, to 1.35
times its value at treatment initiation (data not shown).
while our investigation was in progress, a brief report
described in one other tyrosinemic child that the initially
elevated piiinp level was non-responsive to treatment
with ntbc (27). this case observation and our results,
summarized in figure 1, indicate that in vivo, ntbc
affects the 2-oxoacid utilizing dioxygenases  xxxg1071xxx  and
p4-h in an entirely different manner, all the biomarkers
for the former being highly susceptible, and all those for
the latter totally resistant to inhibition. using an unspecified in vitro assay for p4-h activity isolated from an
unidentified species, the developers of ntbc cursorily
mentioned a similar observation (8). together, these repeatedly noted differences indicate that the inhibitor

ntbc defines an underlying, primary dissimilarity between  xxxg1071xxx  and p4-h, despite shared enzymological
features.
we have examined this conclusion. the stereochemistry of substrate and inhibitor binding to p4-h is known
(5). the stereochemistry of substrate and inhibitor binding to  xxxg1071xxx , though highly relevant for the current
state-of-the-art treatment of tyrosinemia i, has not been
formulated, yet it is evident from crystallographic and
computational data, as summarized in figure 2. consistent with the hag mechanism (2–4), the enzyme’s substrate 4- xxxd40xxx  (4-hpp) displays two
domains, one defined by the benzene ring (domain i) and
one by the 2-oxoacid group (domain ii); the same domain structure applies to ntbc (fig. 2, panel a). in both
agents, these domains define planes that are markedly
out-of-level with each other (fig. 2, panel b). in the case
of 4-hpp, domain i is rotated by almost 70° above domain ii and oriented towards the binding site of dioxygen, the source of the reactive oxygen atom that, in the
product-forming step, transfers from the iron onto the
benzene ring (1,2). in the case of ntbc, domain i also
is oriented towards that same binding site, which places
the electronegative nitro group precisely into the position
usually occupied by the electronegative dioxygen (fig. 2,
panel b). this computer-generated alignment suggests
that the ortho-positioned nitro group can, in a dioxygenlike manner, directly interact with the active site iron, an
effect that at the active site of the enzyme would make
ntbc a terdentate ligand, in contrast to the bidentate
coordination of 4-hpp (fig. 2). indeed, experimental
studies of the structure-activity relation for ntbc and
similar cyclohexanetriones confirm that the presence of
an ortho-positioned electronegative group, carried by a
properly oriented benzene ring, is essential for the effective inhibition of  xxxg1071xxx  (28). in our analysis, the ability to coordinate to, and thus block, the catalytically essential non-heme iron atom emerges as the key feature of
ntbc binding to the active site of  xxxg1071xxx . this ability
is a general characteristic of effective inhibitors for other
2-oxoacid-utilizing dioxygenases, in particular p4-h
(5,6,29–31). however, the active site of p4-h requires
that domain i is positioned in the plane of domain ii,
rendering p4-h particularly susceptible to entirely planar
inhibitors (3,6,29,30). the out-of-level alignment of domain i-vs.-domain ii, as visualized in figure 2 for
 xxxg1071xxx , is in distinct contrast to the conformation of all
known inhibitors for p4-h.  xxxg1071xxx  and p4-h should
therefore display markedly different susceptibilities to
ntbc. our structure-based approach also is applicable
to the evaluation of agents other than ntbc. for instance, usnic acid, a metabolite produced by lichen to
suppress competing plants (32) and an ingredient in
over-the-counter dietary supplements, is a potent inhibitor of plant  xxxg1071xxx  (33) and fits the  xxxg1071xxx  model
presented in figure 2 (data not shown). this provides a

displays an acetylacetone moiety that preferentially tautomerizes
into its keto-enol form (10), enabling interaction with the nonheme iron atom (fe) at the active site of  xxxg1071xxx . 4-hpp binds
via bidentate, ntbc via terdentate coordination. panel 2: binding
of ntbc. the steric arrangement of the ligands ntbc (blue) and
4-hpp (green) at the non-heme iron atom (lavender) in the active
site pocket of  xxxg1071xxx  is depicted. the peptide backbone of the
enzyme, shown as gray ribbon, has been cut open for visualization. the non-heme iron atom displays the typical ‘bipolar’, cisoid
alignment of reactants as required by the hag mechanism (2,4):
apoenzyme residues on one half-sphere, and substrates or inhibitors on the other half-sphere. the o2-derived dioxygen substrate is shown broken open in eggshell fashion (red) to display
the position occupied by the nitro group of ntbc. the apoenzyme residues that hold the non-heme iron atom, identified for
bacterial and, in italics, for human  xxxg1071xxx , occur in highly conserved segments (73% identity/similarity by clustalw formatted
alignment of the bacterial and human sequences; accession
numbers 1cjxa and aac73008, respectively). note that in
ntbc as well as in 4-hpp, the planes of the shared domains (i.
and ii.) stand almost perpendicular on each other.

rationale for the clinical evaluation of usnic acid as a
 xxxg1071xxx  inhibitor in tyrosinemia i.
the persistent elevation of several indicators for hepatic fibrogenesis suggests that even after ntbc medication achieves biochemical normalization of the toxic
metabolites of  xxxg1071xxx  in tyrosinemia i, the biologic

tyrosinemia i, a model for human diseases
correction of the fibrotic process does not occur readily
(fig. 1 and (27)). this caveat is supported by the histopathologic evaluation of repeated liver biopsies performed on patients with tyrosinemia i before and during
prolonged treatment with ntbc (h.r., unpublished observation). the abnormal hepatic metabolism of several
major collagens, sustained at a markedly increased level,
should raise the concerns that over the lifetime of these
children, a fibrotic process even if low-grade may eventually lead to cirrhosis and long-term organ failure, and
may figure as one factor in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. the latter, which occurs in 40% of
tyrosinemic patients not treated with ntbc (34), has
been reported during the first year (35) and the second
year (36) of treatment with ntbc. while early treatment
with ntbc may decrease the incidence of this serious
complication (13,35), it remains entirely unknown at present whether treatment with ntbc affects the evolving
liver fibrosis and its sequelae, such as portal hypertension, which like hepatocellular carcinoma rank among
the major issues in the care for these children (37). by
contrast, in experimental animals the targeted inhibition
of p4-h, which markedly suppresses hepatic fibrosis,
limits both the development of portal hypertension (4)
and of hepatic neoplasms (38). joint inhibition of
 xxxg1071xxx  and p4-h, or inhibition of just p4-h, would be
particularly reassuring for these patients, and would also
provide an invaluable inroad into the development of
p4-h inhibitors for use as hepatoselective fibrosuppressors (4,5), compounds of general interest in treatment of
fibrotic liver disease. our computational analysis of
agents that already are clinically available, suggests that
certain 3-hydroxypyrid-4-ones not only inhibit p4-h (39)
and selectively suppress collagen formation (40), but
also fit the active site of  xxxg1071xxx . they locate precisely
into the van der waals volume occupied at the active site
by the cyclohexane-1,3-dione moiety of ntbc (comp.
fig. 2; data not shown). we predict that such p4-h inhibitors will inhibit  xxxg1071xxx  in vitro and in vivo, will be
useful as pilot structures for chemical optimization, and
represent promising candidates for clinical trials.
note added in proof
since the submission of the manuscript, the crystal
structures of two additional 2-oxoacid-utilizing dioxygenases have been deposited in the pdb database: clavaminate synthase (locator 1ds1) and proline
3-hydroxylase (locator 1e5s). the active site coordinates of both enzymes reveal the same cisoid coordination of a non-heme  xxxd2385xxx , and the same relative
orientation of two histidines and one carboxyl side chain,
that is imposed by the hag mechanism as depicted in
panel 2 of figure 2.
