abstract: biomarkers of exposure, effect, and susceptibility are reviewed in relation to lead exposure.
of the biomarkers of lead exposure, blood lead (pb-b), mainly red cell lead, is a representative of
soft tissue lead, and most widely used as measures of body burden and absorbed (internal) doses of
lead. urine lead (pb-u) as well as plasma lead (pb-p) increases exponentially with increasing pb-b
under a steady-state situation and is a reflection of recent exposure. the amount of lead in plasma
and urine (mpb-p and mpb-u) after administration of a chelating agent (e.g caedta) can be useful
for biomarkers of internal exposure of lead, reflecting the mobilizable pool of lead which consists of
mainly blood and soft tissue lead with only a small fraction derived from bones. the critical effects
in bone marrow arise mainly from the interaction of lead with some enzymatic process responsible
for heme synthesis. the effects can be used for the biomarkers of effects. they are the inhibition of
 xxxg121xxx  ( xxxg121xxx ) and the variation in some metabolite concentrations
(e.g.  xxxd148xxx  in urine (ala-u), blood (ala-b) or plasma (ala-p), coproporphyrin
in urine (cp), zinc protoporphyrin (zp) in blood). the activities of pyrimidine nucleotidase (p5’n)
and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide synthetase (nads) in blood are also decreased in lead
exposure, and nucleotide contents in blood is altered in lead exposure. these effects of lead on
human can be also useful biomarkers of effect. the differences in levels of heme precursors between
two types of  xxxg121xxx  genotypes might be attributable to those in the affinity of different  xxxg121xxx  isozymes
to lead. alad1 homozygotes have higher levels of zp and ala in comparison with alad2 carriers
at the high lead exposure, suggesting that alad1 homozygotes might be more susceptible for
disturbance in heme biosynthesis by lead than alad2 carriers.

biological monitoring
biological monitoring and biomarkers
environmental and biological monitoring are used for the
evaluation of exposure to industrial chemicals, and provide
a tool for assessing workers’ exposure to chemicals. the
context of monitoring should involve measurements carried
out repetitively and regularly for many years. environmental
monitoring includes stationary and personal monitoring. in
a joint meeting of eec, niosh and osha in 1980,
biological monitoring (bm) was defined as the measurement

and assessment of agents or their metabolites either in tissues,
secreta, excreta, expired air or any combination of these to
evaluate exposure and health risk compared to an appropriate
reference1). in many countries bm was developed as a tool
in the prevention of occupational diseases due to toxic
chemicals. for example, in japan bm was introduced in
health surveillance of workers exposed to the agents such
as lead and organic solvents (1989). bm can be divided
into (a) monitoring of exposure, and (b) monitoring of effect,
for which indicators of internal dose and of effect are used
respectively.

the measurements or techniques in bm can be used for
the diagnosis and also risk assessment of the toxic agents in
the filed of environmental health, although bm should not
be confused with diagnosis. the term, biological markers
or biomarkers are general term for specific measurements
reflecting an interaction between a biological system and
an environmental agent, which may be chemical, physical,
or biological2). biomarkers are mainly referred to the
measurements used in the diagnosis or risk assessment in
the field of environmental health. in 1987, national research
council (nrc)3) developed the concept of biomarkers,
describing a continuum of events from exposure to the
development of disease. biomarkers are generally classified
into three groups: biomarkers of exposure, effect, and
susceptibility 3). recently the term is also used for the
measures of bm in the field of industrial health or
occupational medicine. the biomarkers of exposure and
effect correspond to the monitoring of exposure and effect,
respectively. some of confounding factors in bm are related
to the biomarkers of susceptibility.
figure 1 shows biomarkers and disease progression with
exposure to toxic chemicals. chemicals entering the body
produce internal doses as consequence of their disposition
and metabolism. an exogenous substance or its metabolites
or the product of an interaction between a xenobiotic agent
and some target molecules or cells can be used for biomarkers
of exposure. biologically activated chemicals can bind
functioning macromolecules such as enzymes, receptors,
and dnas, resulting in early effects of target tissues or organs.
the early effect in biochemical process is usually reversible,

and occurs within a short time after exposure (subclinical
effect). it can be used for the biomarkers of effect, and may
precede the altered structure or function of tissues, which
may be irreversible and lead to clinical disease. the
toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of chemicals entering
are affected by various individual factors, which are used
as the biomarkers of susceptibility. they may be also defined
as the indicators or measures of inherent or acquired abilities
of individuals to respond to the specific xenobiotic exposure.
biological monitoring of lead workers
recently, typical symptoms of lead poisoning have not
been observed, because of the improvement of industrial
and environmental health, especially in highly industrialized
countries. however, epidemiological studies have indicated
that subclinical effects of lead occur at a low blood lead
concentration (pb-b). the american conference of
governmental industrial hygienists (acgih) guide to
occupational exposure value-1993 described that pb-b should
be controlled to levels of 20 µg/dl or below4), because females,
children, and fetuses are more sensitive to lead exposure
than male adults5–7). women of child bearing potential, whose
pb-b exceeds 10 µg/dl, are at risk of delivering a child with
a pb-b over the current center of disease control (cdc)
guideline of 10 µg/dl. cdc concluded that the tolerance
value for reproductive-age women should be 10 µg/dl of
pb-b8). on the other hands, highly exposure to lead is still
observed in some industries in developing countries and also
in small industries of secondary smelting of lead even in
industrialized countries.

in the low level lead exposure, highly accurate
determination of pb-b remains to be developed, using an
advanced analytical instrument such as inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry (icp-ms), as well as graphite
furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (gfaas). it is also
important to find useful biological markers for evaluation
of subclinical effects of lead at low pb-b levels such as 10–
20 µ g/dl. usual diagnostic determinations of clinical
laboratory such as hematological test like hb and hct are
not useful for the biological monitoring at low level exposure.
so we should develop a new technique for bm of lead
exposure, which are mainly reviewed here.

biomarkers for lead exposure
lead metabolism and exposure markers
inorganic lead is a cumulative toxin absorbed mainly by
lungs and gastrointestinal tract; percutaneous absorption is
minimal in humans, with exception of organic lead.
inhalation is the dominant pathway for lead exposure of
workers in industries and 40–50% of inhaled lead may be
transferred to bloodstream. in adult humans approximately
10% of the dietary lead is absorbed. fig. 2 shows dynamic
equilibrium of lead in human body. in blood, more than
98% of the lead are found in blood cells9, 26). blood lead
(pb-b), mainly red cell lead, is a representative of soft tissue
lead, and most widely used as measures of body burden and
absorbed (internal) doses of lead. the relationship between
pb-b and the concentration of lead in exposure sources is
curvilinear10–12). the half-life for lead in blood and other
soft tissue is about 28–36 days13).
plasma lead (pb-p) has an important role in lead
metabolism, where it is the active center of the body lead
pool, although the concentration is very low. pb-p is
equilibrium with the extra-cellular pool and is directly
involved in all the movements of lead among the different
biological compartments14). thus, lead in plasma circulates
in the body, affects the body lead burden and causes the
toxicity of lead in some soft tissues, such as bone marrow,
kidney, brain and so on. the levels of pb-p are sharply
elevated with a sudden intake or acute exposure to lead and
rapidly diminished by time elapse from it9), indicating that
pb-p is an index for very recent exposure15). the half life is
very short, maybe less than 1 hour.
some fractions of absorbed lead are excreted into urine.
the amount of urine lead (pb-u) depends not only on the
exposure conditions but also on the extent of body burden
and kidney function. pb-u as well as pb-p increases
exponentially with increasing pb-b under a steady-state

exposure.

to the size of the compartments. approximate percentages in body burden and half-lives are shown in the circles. biomarkers of exposure are

situation and is mainly a reflection of recent exposure15).
the amount of lead excreted in urine after administration
(mpb-u) of a chelating agent (e.g caedta) reflects the
mobilizable pool of lead which consists of mainly blood
and soft tissue lead with only a small fraction derived from
bones17). recently authors reported that pb-p after injection
of chelating agent (mpb-p) can be used for evaluation of
amounts of mobilized lead59). a x-ray fluorescence technique
has been developed for measuring lead concentration in bone,
but the use of them are limited in some countries alone.
measurement of lead in hair and teeth has been of practical
use, particularly in epidemiological research.
pb-b, p-u, pb-p
blood lead concentrations are currently regarded as the
most reliable index of exposure to lead. over 95% of the
blood lead is bound to the erythrocytes and seems to be in
dynamic equilibrium with plasma lead14, 30). plasma lead is
more diffusible than erythrocyte lead and more important
for evaluating the toxic effect of lead because the diffusible
form exerts an influence on lead concentrations of other
compartments and produces critical effect in the various
organs14, 30, 54). erythrocytes rather behave as a depository
for lead 17), which might produce some disturbances in
erythrocyte metabolism such as na, k-atpase, deltaaminolevulinic acid dehydratase ( xxxg121xxx ) and nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide synthetase (nads) activity18, 19, 21, 22).

130
ong and lee19) have reported that more than 85% of the
pb incorporated into erythrocytes in vitro is associated
with the cytoplasmic components and the rest is bound to
the stromal membrane. they suggested that the membranebound lead might affect the activity of na, k-atpase. several
workers23–25) have indicated that most of the labeled lead
incorporated into erythrocytes in vitro is found in hemoglobin
fractions. by contrast, sakai et al.20, 66) reported that half
the lead in erythrocyte hemolysate from a lead-exposed
worker was found in protein fractions with a high molecular
weight, including  xxxg121xxx , which had highest affinity for lead
among erythrocyte components in vivo and in vitro.
atomic absorption spectroscopy (aas) is the method most
widely used for lead in biological materials. flame methods
require the pretreatment of samples mineralized by wet or
dry ash techniques, which can be applicable for all kinds of
biological material, such as not only blood and urine, but also
hair and nail. currently, gfaas are the most widely used
techniques for pb-b and pb-u. pb-p can be also determined
by gfaas after solvent extraction of plasma lead chelated
with ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (apdc)9). since
pb-p levels are very low, maybe less than 1/100 of pb-b, the
procedure include so many steps and chemicals, which might
cause the contamination of samples with exogenous lead.
icp-ms is recently introduced for the determination of
lead in biological materials16, 26–29, 98). pb-p as well as pb-b
and pb-u could be simply determined by icp-ms16). for
the analysis of lead in plasma, whole blood, and urine,
samples are prepared by diluting 5, 50, and 80-fold, with
nitric acid solution, respectively. one of the advantages for
icp-ms determination is of a wide range of linearity in the
calibration curves as compared with aas, where dynamic
range is very narrow. another advantage for icp-ms
determination is of simple procedure and also high sensitivity,
which enables us to determine very low levels of pb-p,
without complicated and time consuming pretreatment.
using icp-ms, schütz et al.26) has reported the ratio of
pb-p/pb-b increased with increasing pb-b, in other words,
there is a logarithmic relationship between pb-b and pb-p.
based on the correlation equation by sakai et al.16), pb-p
level corresponding to pb-b levels of 400 µg/l is calculated
to be about 1.9 µg/l. the pb-p level is close to that in the
report by schütz et al.26), from whose data it is calculated to
be about 2.2 µg/l.
203

mpb-u, mpb-p
the chelatable lead excreted in urine (mpb-u) is
considered to be an excellent measure of potentially toxic
fraction of the body lead burden13), and usually determined

t sakai
in urine collected for 24 h after calcium disodium
ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (caedta) administration31).
recently, sakai et al.59) have reported that pb-p concentration
at 2 h after the start of caedta injection (mpb-p) is well
correlated with the amount of lead excreted in urine for 24
h thereafter, and is a useful measure for the chelatable lead.
thus, mpb-p as well as mpb-u are very important indices
of lead as exposure, distribution, and health risk. however,
the concentration of lead in plasma or serum is not routinely
measured, so far. one of the main reasons is the very low
concentration of pb-p, which is difficult to determine by
aas. in the aas techniques, it needs trouble some
procedures of chelation and extraction described above9),
which might result in contamination of samples with
exogenous lead. recently, a highly sensitive instrument,
icp-ms, can be used for the measurement of lead in plasma
or in serum16, 26, 98) as mentioned above.

biomarkers for lead effect
lead effect on target organ
the organs or tissues where the first biological effects
can be observed with increasing amounts of chemicals are
termed “critical organs or tissues”. the critical effects
(subclinical effect) appear when the concentration reaches
a critical level in critical organs or tissues. in lead exposure
bone marrow, central and peripheral nervous system, kidney
and digestive system are critical organs. critical
concentrations of lead in bone marrow can be detected by
measuring the degree of disturbances in the heme biosynthetic
pathway and nucleotide metabolisms. the decreased enzyme
activity or the amounts of altered intermediates in the
biochemical pathways and also other adverse effects in critical
organs can be used for the biomarkers of effects.
dose-effect and does-response relationships
the relationships between the amounts of dose and the
degree of effect produced by the dose are denoted as doseeffect relationship and are an essential requirement for
biological effect monitoring. the evaluation of degree of
exposure or its effect is based on the dose-effect relationship.
the dose-response relationship may be also useful for the
evaluation of effect in a group level, because not all the
subjects react in the same degree at an identical dose.
response is expressed by the parentage of subjects in the
group who respond the dose and show a specific values of
effect.

biomarkers of lead exposure
lead effect on heme and nucleotide metabolisms
the critical effects in bone marrow arise mainly from the
interaction of lead with some enzymatic process responsible
for heme synthesis (fig. 3). these interactions can be
sensitively determined by the inhibition of deltaaminolevulinic acid dehydratase ( xxxg121xxx ) and the variation
in some metabolite concentrations (e.g. delta- xxxd148xxx 
acid in urine (ala-u), blood (ala-b) or plasma (alap), coproporphyrin in urine (cp), zinc protoporphyrin (zp)
in blood). analyses of porphyrins in biological materials
have been developed along with the monitoring and diagnosis
of lead effect on human during this century32). the activities
of pyrimidine nucleotidase (p5’n) and nads activity in
blood are also decreased in lead exposure, and nucleotide
contents in blood is altered in lead exposure. these effects
of lead on human can be also useful biomarkers of effect.
1)  xxxg121xxx 
 xxxg121xxx ,  xxxg121xxx  ( xxxg121xxx ) is the
second enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway which
catalyses the condensation of two molecules of ala to form
one molecule of porphobilinogen. erythrocyte  xxxg121xxx 
activity is rapidly inhibited by lead exposure 20) .
determination of  xxxg121xxx  activity in erythrocytes is one of
the most useful methods for evaluating lead exposure,
because the activity is extremely sensitive to and specific
for blood lead concentration. the activity is specifically
inhibited by lead at concentrations between 5 and 50 µg/
100 g blood33–36). the highly purified enzyme from human

erythrocytes is a homo-octomer with a molecular weight of
252 000 and is inhibited at 1 and 5 µm lead37); the crude
enzyme is also inhibited at a concentration exceeding 1 um38).
sakai et al.20) has suggested that certain factors involves in
the hemoglobin fraction account for highly sensitive nature
of the enzyme to lead.
for the monitoring purpose the activity is usually
determined by the method of cec (committee of european
community)39). however there are two weak points in the
determination of  xxxg121xxx  activity itself ( xxxg121xxx (u)); wide range
of normal activity and unstable nature of the activity during
storage. the problems can be resolved by the activation
methods by heating, zinc ion and/or dithiothreitol (dtt).
depressed  xxxg121xxx  activity in lead-exposed subjects is restored
by heating the enzyme solution 40, 41) or by adding shcompounds42–44) or zinc ion44–49) to the reaction mixture. the
extent of restoration in activity is correlated with blood lead
concentration and thus can be helpful in evaluating exposure
to lead38, 42, 50–53). the ratio (or percentage) of activity without
activation to activated activity ( xxxg121xxx (%)) is rather stable
during storage and varied in a narrow range in control
subjects55).
2) ala-u, ala-b, and ala-p
ala is synthesized in mitochondria from glycine and
succinyl-coa by ala synthetase (alas), which is rate
limiting enzyme in heme pathway. the decrease in  xxxg121xxx 
activity and indirect activation of alas due to negative
feedback regulation by lead exposure cause an increase in

fig. 3. effect of lead on heme biosynthesis and biomarkers of effect, which is indicated
in italics.

ala in various tissues and in plasma, and consequently
excretion of ala in urine is elevated56). ala in plasma or
blood reflect the effect of lead on bone marrow more directly
than ala in urine (ala-u), although ala-u has been
recommended as a measure of lead effect57). an exponential
relationship between urine and plasma ala has been
observed in wide range of pb-b levels.
since the assay of ala-u was introduced in the monitoring
of lead exposure in 1950s, several method of analyses were
developed using ion exchange column chromatography or
solvent extraction procedures with the combination of color
reaction with ehrlich’s reagent. in 1990, high-performance
liquid chromatography (hplc) method with sensitive
fluorescence detection of alau was reported by okayama
et al58). thereafter some investigators have tried to determine
ala in plasma or serum (ala-p or ala-sr) for evaluation
of the effects of lead60, 61). morita et al.62, 63) has improved
the method, which is applicable to the determination of both
ala-p and ala-b, and achieves a good recovery rate
(almost 100%) as well as high sensitivity. when plasma
and blood samples is stored at 4°c, ala-p and ala-b levels
do not decrease significantly for 6 days and 3 days,
respectively. almost all of ala molecules in blood exist
in plasma and not in blood cells, irrespective pb-b, and that
both values may be similarly useful as indices of lead
exposure. however, ala-p is more suitable than ala-b
for routine analysis, because the distribution of ala in blood
and the stability of sample storage.
the correlation coefficient of pb-b vs logala-p or
logala-b and that of pb-b vs logalad(u) or log  xxxg121xxx (%)
are in the same range64). these correlation coefficiens are
higher than those pb-b vs logala-ucre, logala-u, or
logzp. in the dose-effect relationship between the logarithms
of pb-b and ala-p, a two-phase increase in ala-p is
observed as pb-b increases. ala-p levels increase slowly
below 40 µg/dl (slow phase) and rapidly above 40 ug/dl
(rapid phase). in the latter phase, ala-p increases
continuously up to 100 µg/dl of pb-b. significant correlations
are found in both the slow and the rapid phase. the pb-b of
the intersecting point of the two lines is calculated as 42.9
µg/dl64).
the relationship between ala-p and  xxxg121xxx (u) or
 xxxg121xxx (%) is also two phase in nature64). the two regression
lines intersect at 22.7u or 20.9% of  xxxg121xxx  activity. ala-p
increase slowly with the reduction of  xxxg121xxx  activity down
to the intersecting point; this phase corresponds to the “slow
phase” mentioned above. as the  xxxg121xxx  activity decrease
to the intersecting point, ala-p begin to increase sharply;
this phase corresponds to the “rapid phase”. the slow phase

t sakai
in ala-p or ala-b increase may be explained by the linear
inhibition of  xxxg121xxx  activity. when the inhibition of  xxxg121xxx 
activity reachs a plateau at pb-b levels between 40 and 50
µg/dl, the rapid phase may be accounted for the another
mechanism, such as induction in alas. meredith et al.65)
has reported that severe depression of heme synthesis induces
alas through negative feedback regulation at pb-b levels
more than 2 µm (41.4 µg/dl) and  xxxg121xxx  activity less than
18 units. these values are comparable to the intersecting
points of the two regression lines at a pb-b level of 42.9
µg/dl64).
3) coproporphyrin (cp)
 xxxd1749xxx  i and iii are metabolic intermediates
of heme pathway that are easily oxidized to their respective
coproporphyrins. the increased excretion of isomer iii is
observed in urine from lead workers at least 2 weeks after
the commencement of exposure. in steady state exposure,
cp excretion can be positively correlated with pb-b, as well
as with alau. cp levels are significantly increased at pbb levels above 70–80 µg/dl31). analytical techniques for
cp are traditionally based on preliminary extraction and
subsequent fluorometric or spectrophotometric
determinations. some disorders of porphyrin metabolisms
produce unique patterns of cp excretion in urine67). cp i is
excreted in excess amounts in urine from patients with
congenital erythropoietic porphyria. hereditary
coproporphyria is characterized by the excretion of large
amounts of cp iii, mainly in feces but also in urine.
several workers 68–72) have developed hplc for the
measurement of porphyrin derivatives in biological materials
such as blood, urine and feces. simultaneous separations
of various derivatives of porphyrins are desirable for purposes
of differential diagnosis. sakai et al.73) have reported a simple
method for separating and determining cp i and iii in urine.
the method is simpler with respect to pretreatment of
samples, and cps in concentrations as low as 10 µg/l of
urine can be detected. good correlations of cp vs pb-b are
obtained by the method74).
4) zinc protoporpyrin (zp)
the final step of heme synthesis, introducing fe2+ into
protoporphyrin xi (pp), is also affected by lead. inhibition
of fe3+ reduction by lead exposure causes the decreases in
transportation of fe 2+ into mitochondria 75), resulting
accumulation of pp in erythrocyte. pp is enzymatically or
non-enzymatically chelated with zn 2+ to form zinc
protoporpyrin (zp). thus accumulation of pp or zp in
erythrocytes provides an index of disturbance of the final

industrial health 2000, 38, 127–142

biomarkers of lead exposure
step in heme synthesis, suggesting biochemical effect of lead
on bone marrow, and of active deposits of the metal in the
tissue.
several methods have been developed for the determining
erythrocyte protoporphyrin (pp) concentrations; they
include acid extraction76, 77), detergent dilution78, 79), neutral
solvent extraction80–82), hematofluorimetry83, 84) and hplc
methods86, 126). the method most widely used is the acid
extraction method, although a two-step extraction is
complicated and the second extraction with dilute
hydrochloric acid cleaves zinc from zp molecules to form
free pp. zp concentrations are therefore measured as free
pp fluorescence by the acid extraction method (fep method).
the detergent dilution method is subject to serious
hemoglobin interference. the disadvantage of neutral solvent
extraction are low extraction efficiency, variable recovery
and interference of pp. the limitation of hematofluorimetry
which is a simple and rapid technique for zp detection, lies
in weak quality control of standardization and in interference
from bilirubin and pp 84). in these three methods the
fluorescence of zp is usually measured.
the significant advantage of hplc methods over other
methods is that zp and pp can be separately determined in
a single run, eliminating the optical interference from coextractable substances. zp levels have been known to
increase in iron deficiency other than lead poisoning85), while
pp levels in erythropoietic  xxxg781xxx .
by hplc method zp and pp can be separately determined
and total protoporphyrin (tp=0.9zp + pp) can be
calculated86). in acid extraction method zp is converted into
pp, and both porphyrins are measured as pp, which is
commonly called fep. tp by hplc is comparable with
fep by acid extraction method, and zp by hplc is with
that by hematofluorimetry. consistently good agreement
was found between the hplc method and each of the two
established methods.
the correlation coefficients between 0.9zp or tp and pbb are significantly higher than that between pp and pb-b,
indicating that the concentrations of zp and tp determined
by hplc method are useful indicators for the evaluation of
occupational exposure to lead86). the ratio of 0.9zp to tp
in the workers ranged from 0.53 to 0.99 (mean ± sd, 0.86 ±
0.085) and is independent on pb-b levels. reference values
by hplc method have been reported in blood from 34 male
and 34 female subjects not exposed to lead. the mean ±
sd concentrations of zp, pp, and tp were 57.4 ± 14.7, 10.6
± 8.6, and 62.2 ± 20.0 µg/dl of red blood cells in male and
69.5 ± 22.5, 10.0 ± 8.4, and 72.6 ± 26.4 µg/dl red blood
cells in female, respectively86).

133
5) comparison of threshold levels of pb-b for heme
parameters
threshold (no-effect) levels of pb-b have been examined
for the disturbances in heme metabolism in 191 lead workers,
who are divided into 11 groups by pb-b intervals of 5 µg/
dl64). both the reduction in  xxxg121xxx  activity (u and %) and
the elevation in ala-p (also ala-b) in each group (2–11)
with a pb-b level more than 5 µg/dl were significant in the
comparison with group 1 (pb-b<5 µg/dl). the no-effect
level of pb-b for  xxxg121xxx  activity has previously been reported
to be 10 µg/dl57, 87). the threshold level for inhibition of
 xxxg121xxx  is also coincident with that for increases in ala-p
levels. thus the data indicate that the decrease in  xxxg121xxx 
activity reflects the effect of active lead in bone marrow
even at low pb-b levels of ca. 5 µg/dl. by contrast, while a
significant increase in ala-u corrected for creatinine (alaucre) and zp is continually found only in groups with pbb levels more than 30 µg/dl.
6) roc analyses for the evaluation of diagnostic values of
heme parameters
to compare the diagnostic efficiency of heme parameters,
receiver operative characteristic (roc) plots are adopted
in 191 lead workers64). the roc curve for ala-p is identical
to that for  xxxg121xxx (u) at the low to moderate pb-b levels from
10 to 40 µg/dl, where the area under the roc curves is
between 0.81 and 0.94. the area indicates that ala-p and
 xxxg121xxx (u) have moderate to high accuracy for the diagnosis
of low lead exposure88). the area under the roc curve for
 xxxg121xxx (%) has the highest diagnostic efficiency among the
parameters examined for low to moderate exposure.
however,  xxxg121xxx  activity cannot be used as the indicator
for the highly exposed group because the decrease in  xxxg121xxx 
activity reaches a plateau at a pb-b level between 40 and
50 µg/dl89). furthermore,  xxxg121xxx  is extremely unstable after
blood sampling, and the analytical procedure is complicated.
thus, determination of  xxxg121xxx  activity is not widely used
for routine analyses in the biological monitoring of lead
exposure. by contrast, ala-p increases continuously even
at pb-b levels more than 40 µg/dl64). ala-p is stable for a
long time after sampling and the procedure of ala-p
determination is also simple90).
roc curves for ala-ucre and zp are essentially identical
at every pb-b level from 10–40 µg/dl64). the area under the
roc curves gradually increases from 0.58 to 0.84 as pb-b
increases from 10 to 40 µg/dl64), indicating that the parameters
have low to moderate accuracy for the diagnosis of low to
moderate exposure.
based on the above findings, of the heme parameters ala-

p can be considered the best discriminators of lead exposure
over the wide range of pb-b from baseline to high.
pyrimidinenucleotide metabolism
in lead workers, erythrocyte enzyme pyrimidine 5’nucleotidase (p5n) activity declines linearly with increasing
pb-b between 10 and 100 µg/100 g, and it can be used for
an indicator of lead exposure91). congenital deficiency of
this enzyme results in nonsphecrocytic hemolytic anemia
in which the erythrocytes contain large amount of pyrimidine
nucleotides and show pronounced basophilic stipping
(bse)92). the accumulated pyrimidine compounds appear
to cause feedback inhibition of ribonucleic acid (rna)
catabolism93). undegrated ribosomes aggregate to produce
bse. accumulation of pyrimidine compounds in
erythrocytes also affects  xxxg825xxx 
and suppresses pentose phosphate cycle activity, which may
result in hemolysis94). the mechanism of hemolysis in lead
poisoning appears similar to that postulated in hereditary
deficiency (p5nd).
1) pyrimidine 5’-nucleotidase (p5n) activity
p5n catalyses the hydrolysis of pyrimidine 5’monophosphate to yield pyrimidine nucleoside and inorganic
phosphate. techniques for assay of p5n activity fall into
two categories; one based on the determination of inorganic
phosphate and the other on the determination of pyrimidine
nucleosides. in the conventional method for determining
p5n activity the amount of inorganic phosphate released is
determined colorimetrically92). inorganic phosphate (and
other sources of inorganic phosphate) are normally present
in erythrocytes, so to reduce the blank values the phosphate
must be removed by dialyzing the lysate before the enzyme
assay. it is also necessary to incubate the samples for the
relatively long periods to release sufficient phosphate.
because of these disadvantage the determination of p5n
activity has not been used frequently in the routine monitoring
of lead exposure. the other type of assay of p5n activity
has been reported by torrance et al.95). in this method
radioactive cmp (14c-cmp, cytidine 5’-monophosphate) is
used as the substrate, which is absorbed to on to barium
sulfate after the reaction is stopped and the 14c-cytidine
formed is counted with a liquid scintillation counter. this
method eliminates the need for the dialysis of the enzyme
solution and is also extremely sensitive. however, the method
cannot easily be carried out in every clinical laboratory,
because of radioactive method.
in the method reported by sakai et al.96, 97) p5n activity is
also determined by measuring liberated pyrimidine

t sakai
nucleosides. the product is separated from the substrate
and from red cell constituents by means of hplc. in this
method dialysis of the samples is not necessary and the
incubation time is shortened because the amount of
endogenous uridine is non-detectable and the intensity of
the absorption of uridine at 254 nm is high. the method
has been was further improved using whole blood as the
enzyme source with con a which inhibits the serum
nucleotidase activity 91). in the improved method hb
determination may be also omitted and the activity expressed
as µmol/h/l blood or µmole/h/l rbc rather than µmole/h/g
hb. the activity may be determined even when the blood
is partly hemolysed during storage at 4°c, which has little
effect on the activity95, 97), and is expressed as µmole/h/l blood.
torrance et al.95) reported that the reduction of p5n activity
was only 1.4% after storage of samples for seven days at
4°c. as the assay of p5n can be carried out with stored
samples, it seems to be more suitable than ala-d for
screening lead exposure.
in the hplc method the geometric and arithmetic mean
(± sd) of p5n activity are 17.4 (± 1.2) and 17.7 (± 2.95),
respectively, in subjects whose pb-b values are less than
10 µg/100 g (mean ± sd: 6.58 ± 1.6 µg/100 g)97). the mean
activity of the group is similar to that reported by sato et
al.99), taking into account that the substrate used in hplc
method is ump. cook et al.100) reported normal values ±
sd for p5n activity as 12.0 ± 0.71 (n=14), using an hplc
method with ump as the substrate. the mean pb-b ± sd
in their control group was 7.6 ± 4.0 µg/100 g. the normal
value for p5n activity by cook et al.100) is similar to those
reported by american and european investigators92, 101–105)
but somewhat lower than those reported by sakai et al. or
by sato et al.99). it seems that the difference in p5n activity
is not only due to the different concentrations of pb-b but
also to other factors, including genetic differences.
significant correlation is reported between logp5n and
pb-b (r> − 0.79) at pb-b values between 3 and 80 µg/100
 xxxg97xxx , 106, 107). p5n activity is sensitive to lead in blood as low
as 10–20 µg/100 g. the activity at pb-b of 10–20 µg/100 g
is reduced by 13.2% compared with that at pb-b levels of
less than 10 µg/100 g. thus the threshold (no effect) value
of pb-b for p5n activity may be less than 10 µg/100 g.
based on these findings and the description by paglia et
al.102), it appears that p5n activity is progressively inhibited
over a wide range of pb-b values between 10 and 100 µg/
100 g, and has a wide field of application in the monitoring
of lead effects.
highly significant correlation is found between p5n
activity and other biological indicators of lead effect97),

industrial health 2000, 38, 127–142

biomarkers of lead exposure
suggesting that the decrease in p5n activity is able to predict
the metabolic disturbances in heme biosynthesis. in male
workers exposed to lead and other havey metals mohammedbrahim et al.107) have reported the validity of p5n and zp
as 1.71 and 1.73, respectively, when pb-b values are greater
than 40 µg/100 ml. a high validity for p5n (1.86 at a cut
off of 10 unit) at pb-b 40 µg/100 g is also reported by sakai
et al.97), and it is higher than those of the other indicators
examined. thus it indicates that p5n is a good discriminator
at moderate pb-b values.
2) accumulation of pyrimidine nucleotides in erythrocytes
due to the decreased activity of erythrocyte p5n by lead
exposure a large amount of pyrimidine nucleotides is
accumulated in erythrocytes. the various kinds of pyrimidine
nucleotides are observed in lead exposed subjects. the
accumulated pyrimidine compounds appear to cause
feedback inhibition of ribonucleic acid (rna) catabolism93)
and undegrated ribosomes aggregate to produce bse, which
is specifically observed in lead poisoned subjects. thus
the metabolic disturbances of red cell nucleotide pool are
used for the biomarkers of lead effect instead of detection
of bse.
angle et al.108) have found three nucleotides (i.e., utp,
ctp, and cdp) that are increased in blood cells of leadtreated animals using anion-exchange hplc. sakai et al.
have reported hplc separation of 14 nucleotides including
cdpc and  xxxd3474xxx , which are major nucleotides found in
erythrocyte from lead exposed workers. the pyrimidine
diphosphodiesters, cdpc and  xxxd3474xxx , and ctp are the most
prominent abnormal nucleotides in blood cells of leadexposed subjects. the levels are well correlated with pb-b
and also p5n activity. these nucleotides increased in lead
workers are similar to those found in p5n deficiency
(p5nd)109–111), but the concentrations are much lower than
the massive amounts found in p5nd.
sakai et al.112, 115) have found that the levels of purine
nucleotides (other than pyrimidine nucleotides) are also
affected by lead exposure, suggesting disturbances of the
energy production system by lead. as pb-b values rise,
atp levels show a slight reduction, whereas amp levels
are correlated positively with pb-b. energy charges are
consequently have decreased in workers whose pb-b is
greater than 60 µg/100 g. angle et al.108, 140) however, that
purine nucleotides are unchanged in  xxxd187xxx  from leadpoisoned rabbits with mean pb-b levels between 30 and 72
µg/dl. the energy charge is also normal in two children
with p5nd 111) . the observed pattern of glycolytic
intermediates in lead poisoning also suggestes that the activity

135
of the embden-meyerhof pathway is normal113, 114). however,
torrance and whittaker109) have found that the concentrations
of adp and amp in red blood cells of p5nd are between 2
and 3 times of normal, and the distribution of adenine
nucleotides is abnormal with the lower energy forms being
favored.
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide synthetase
in the final step of the preiss-handler pathway for
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad) biosynthesis116),
nad synthetase (nads) transfers an amino group from
glutamine (gln) to  xxxd2715xxx  adenine dinucleotide
(naad) to form nad. nad is a coenzyme for
oxidoreduction, and considered to play an important role in
preventing oxidative stress in tissues. nadh is regarded
to supply reducing equivalents and to maintain normal levels
of glutathione in tissues117). impaired rate of nad synthesis
in erythrocytes is reported in some disorders (e.g., pyruvate
kinase deficiency 118) , enolase deficiency 119) and
thalassemia120)).
the nads activity is reduced in erythrocyte from lead
exposed subjects21, 121, 122). zerez et al.121) firstly reported
that nads activity was markedly decreased in three workers
exposed to lead. the world health organization (who)
refers to the decrease in nads activity as one of the important
effects of lead on humans122). to determine nads activity,
zerez et al. use partly purified enzyme. their method is
almost impossible for routine analyses in the clinical
laboratory because of the complicated procedures with
purification steps. morita et al.21) describe that whole blood
can be simply used for nads assay, and demonstrate the
dose-effect relationship of nads activity versus blood lead
concentration (pb-b), indicating that the activity could be
useful as an biological effect marker. the pb-b level inducing
50% inhibition of nads activity is calculated to be 43 µg/
dl of pb-b.
recently, a simple and reliable method has been further
developed for the analysis of nads activity in human blood,
using hplc22). the concentrations of 0.5 mm atp, 15 mm
glutamine (gln), and 0.5 mm naad are good compromise
for the nads determination by hplc method. the chosen
conditions are the most convenient and economical, without
an inconveniently high concentration of naad. the
concentrations are also enough to discriminate the decreased
activity in lead exposed subject. hplc method is more
useful than spectrophotometric method for routine analyses
in clinical laboratories and for biochemical research on the
enzyme. using hplc method, the kinetics of the enzyme
can be also examined. nads activity is remarkably

136
decreased with blood from a lead worker even at the higher
concentrations of atp or gln22). however, the depressed
activity of nads in a lead worker tends to be partly recovered
with increasing naad concentration.

biomarkers of lead for susceptibility
the biomarker of susceptibility is an indicator of an
inherent or acquired ability of an organism to response to
the challenge of exposure to specific xenobiotic substance2).
the biomarkers of susceptibility are concerned with factors
in kinetics and dynamics of exogenous chemicals (fig. 1).
under the similar exposure conditions, genetic differences
of individuals in metabolisms or macromolecule components
may produce markedly different doses at the target organs
and thus a different level of response. although most attention
has been focused on genetic susceptibility, some of acquired
factors, such as nutrition, disease, physiological changes,
medication and exposure to other environmental agents may
also affect individual susceptibility (fig. 1). biomarkers of
susceptibility are refer to the indicator of interfering or
confounding factors in bm, except interfering factors related
to the determination or sampling procedures (e.g. effect of
storage, time of sampling etc).
in lead exposure  xxxg121xxx  polymorphism is reportedly
related in susceptibility of lead effect on heme metabolism.
recently, several groups have investigated on the
relationships between  xxxg121xxx  polymorphism and
susceptibility to lead toxicity123–125, 127–129). in these studies,
effect indices of lead exposure, such as  xxxg121xxx , ala-p, alau and zp, are examined whether  xxxg121xxx  genotype influences
the values of the indices.
human  xxxg121xxx  gene is located in chromosome 9q34130).
the gene frequencies of  xxxg121xxx  alleles 1 and 2 were
reportedly about 0.9 and 0.1, respectively, in several
caucasian populations131–133). in 1991, a simple method using
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) is developed for the analysis
of  xxxg121xxx  genotype134). using pcr method, the frequency
of alad2 allele reported in various populations is 0.114 in
307 korean124), 0.074 in 691 american136), and 0.085 in 205
chinese141). these frequencies are nearly the same as those
(0.087) by sakai et al.137) in 317 japanese.
in comparison with the alad1 sequence, the only
meaning difference in the alad2 cdna is g-to-c
transversion of nucleotide 177 in the coding region, which
creates an mspi restriction site and causes the replacement
of a lysine by a asparagine134). the difference in amino acid
might result in distinct charge isozyme, and alad2 protein
may bind lead more tightly than alad1 protein135).

t sakai
actually, alad2 carriers have reportedly higher pb-b
levels than alad1 homozygotes in the subjects exposed
to lead occupationally or environmentally123, 124, 133, 138). in
the recent study using hplc with icp-ms, bergdahl et al.139)
indicate that alad2 carriers have higher percentage of lead
bound to  xxxg121xxx  protein than alad1 homozygotes.
however, there is no significant difference in  xxxg121xxx  activity
between the two groups of  xxxg121xxx  genotypes when pb-b
levels are matched each other138). in the report by sakai et
al.,  xxxg121xxx  activity is not significantly different between two
 xxxg121xxx  genotypes in each pb-b group137).
 xxxg121xxx  genotypes modify lead effects on heme metabolism
in highly exposed workers, while  xxxg121xxx  genotypes do
not affect the levels of heme precursors at low-pb-b
levels129, 135, 137). sakai et al. reported that zp levels in alad1
homozygotes are significantly higher than that in alad2
carriers at the pb-b levels of 20–59 µg/dl. at the pb-b
levels of 40–59 µg/dl, ala-p levels in alad1 homozygotes
are also significantly higher than that in alad2 carriers.
sithisarankul et al.128) have reported that ala-p levels in
alad1 homozygotes are higher than those in alad2
carriers, although zp levels are not significantly different
between both  xxxg121xxx  genotypes in lead workers. the
difference may be partly explained by the insufficient number
(n=65) of workers in the latter study. on the other hand,
schwartz et al.124) and alexander et al.129) have reported that
alad1 homozygotes show the higher zp levels compared
to alad2 carriers. in their study, the number of the subjects
are sufficiently large (n=308 and 134, respectively), but alap levels do not examined.
the differences in levels of heme precursors between two
types of  xxxg121xxx  genotypes might be attributable to those in
the affinity of different  xxxg121xxx  isozymes to lead. because
alad2 protein can more tightly bind lead in blood, the
amounts of “biological active” lead in bone morrow tissue
might be lowered in comparison with alad1 homozygotes.
in the case, lead bound to the  xxxg121xxx  protein might be
detoxified or inactive form, which prevents the lead inhibition
of  xxxg781xxx  and also of ferrous incorporation into
mitochondria, resulting in relatively low levels of zp in
alad2 carriers124). reductive process of fe3+ is reportedly
inhibited by lead75). by the mechanisms, incorporation of
ferrous into protoporphyrin might be more highly inhibited
by lead in alad1 homozygotes than alad2 carriers,
resulting in the higher zp and lower heme levels. reduced
levels of heme might induce ala-s by negative feedback
regulation and produce the large amount of ala64, 65). thus,
relatively higher levels of ala-p can be explained in alad1
homozygotes in comparioson with alad2 carriers.

industrial health 2000, 38, 127–142

137

biomarkers of lead exposure
in conclusion, alad1 homozygotes have higher levels
of zp and ala in comparison with alad2 carriers at the
high lead exposure, suggesting that alad1 homozygotes
might be more susceptible for disturbance in heme
biosynthesis by lead than alad2 carriers.
