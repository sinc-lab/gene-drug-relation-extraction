the preparation and human muscarinic receptor profiling of oxybutynin and n-desethyloxybutynin enantiomers.  oxybutynin (1) is a non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist that is used clinically for the treatment of urinary incontinence. the major metabolite of oxybutynin in humans is desethyloxybutynin (2). we have prepared the enantiomers of 1 and 2 and evaluated their ability to displace n-ct(3)-scopolamine chloride ((3)h-nms) binding on human cloned muscarinic m1-5 receptors. compounds 1 and 2 potently displaced (3)h-nms binding at m1, m3 and m4 receptors, but were less potent at the m2 and m5 subtypes. however, metabolite 2 was more potent than the parent compound 1 in the binding assay. in general the r enantiomers were more potent than their respective s enantiomers. therefore, we suggest that the cholinergic side effects associated with 2 may be due to its greater apparent potency with m1 and m3 receptors, especially of its r-enantiomer, when compared with parent drug 1.
