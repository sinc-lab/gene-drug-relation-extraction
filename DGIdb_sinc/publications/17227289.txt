abstract
a number of life-threatening clinical disorders may be amenable to treatment with a
drug that can stimulate respiratory drive. these include acute respiratory failure secondary
to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, post-anesthetic respiratory depression, and
apnea of prematurity.  xxxd1934xxx  has been available for over forty years for the treatment
of these conditions and it has a low side effect profile compared to other available agents.
generally though, the use of  xxxd1934xxx  has been limited to these clinical niches involving
patients in the intensive care, post-anesthesia care and neonatal intensive care units.
recent basic science studies have made considerable progress in understanding the molecular mechanism of  xxxd1934xxx ’s respiratory stimulant action. although it is unlikely that
 xxxd1934xxx  will undergo a clinical renaissance based on this new understanding, it represents a significant advance in our knowledge of the control of breathing.

introduction
 xxxd1934xxx  is a drug that was synthesized initially in the 1960s and then investigated
clinically and used therapeutically over the next 20 years. its use has remained in a narrow
niche but recent experimental evidence from various research laboratories, including our
own, has rekindled interest into the mechanism of action of  xxxd1934xxx  and other related
drugs. this review will summarize the history, development and clinical use of  xxxd1934xxx 
and discuss current insights into its molecular mode of action.

ulant action in mammals (53). a pressor response
following  xxxd1934xxx  administration was also
noted. both of these effects were perceived to
occur via stimulation of the central nervous
system (cns). in fact, animals “anesthetized” with phenobarbital were awakened by high
dose intravenous  xxxd1934xxx  (5 mg/kg) while untreated animals developed convulsions. as
such  xxxd1934xxx  has been categorized as an analeptic agent (a stimulant of the central
nervous system) with greater margin of safety than other cns stimulants available at that
time such as  xxxd2947xxx  or pentylenetetrazol (ptz). its oral ld50 in rats is 211 mg/kg (40).

early clinical studies
one of the first investigations of its clinical use in humans was that of stephen and
talton at duke university (51). they found that, while  xxxd1934xxx  had minor respiratory
effect on patients given spinal anesthesia alone, it substantially increased respiratory rate
and tidal volume in patients anesthetized with potent inhalational anesthetics (halothane,
cyclopropane, ether, or  xxxd2604xxx ). arterial blood gas analysis showed that  xxxd1934xxx  induced respiratory alkalosis with lower pco2 and higher ph compared to control
patients. a mild hemodynamic pressor effect was noted (10–20 mm hg increase in blood
pressure) as well as increased cerebral arousal and more rapid awakening from the inhaled
anesthetic. these authors recommended its use in post-anesthetic care units for patients
who displayed central nervous system or respiratory depression.
winnie and collins went on to coin the term “pharmacologic ventilator” to describe the
action of  xxxd1934xxx  and other analeptic agents being investigated at that time (55). they
directly compared  xxxd1934xxx  to other stimulants such as ptz, nikethamide, bemegride,
ethamivan,  xxxd312xxx  and methylphenidate (ritalin) in healthy women undergoing
light barbiturate anesthesia.  xxxd1934xxx  produced a significantly greater increase in minute
ventilation compared to the other agents but had only a middling effect on arousal or recovery time from anesthesia in this study. this and other studies heightened interest within
the anesthesia community about the utility of  xxxd1934xxx  as an “antagonist” to general anesthetics and led to studies by pulmonologists and neonatologists in other patient groups.

metabolism
 xxxd1934xxx  is metabolized very rapidly when given intravenously. pharmacokinetic
studies in dogs and humans demonstrated that blood levels decline rapidly after a single
intravenous dose (fig. 2) (6,10,45), consistent with the short duration of action reported in

humans (8–10 min) (51). approximately 40–50% of a bolus dose can be recovered as
metabolites in the urine after 24–48 h. the effective blood concentration is approximately
2 ìg/ml (9), which can be reached in patients by administering a loading dose of
1 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 1 mg/kg/h (42).

cellular and molecular actions
as described above, the ability of  xxxd1934xxx  to stimulate the respiratory drive was recognized soon after its discovery. however controversy still exists as to its principal site of
action — centrally, on brainstem respiratory centers or peripherally on carotid and aortic
chemoreceptors. for example, calverly et al. in a study of humans treated with  xxxd1934xxx 
found evidence not only for central sensitization to hypercarbia by  xxxd1934xxx  but also for
peripheral sensitization to hypoxemia (9). data from both animal and human studies have
been conflicting. presented below are studies that support both effects. figure 3, adapted
from a recent review of respiratory control (16), outlines the principal elements involved
in chemosensory control of breathing. peripheral chemoreceptors in the neck and aorta,
activated by hypoxemia (pao2 < 55) and acidosis, and brainstem centers activated by ph
changes in csf induced by hypercarbia (ph < 7.3, acute rise in pco2 » 10 torr) stimulate
ventral nuclei, such as pre-boltzinger complex to drive increased depth and rate of
respiration.

these nuclei drive respiratory motor neurons that control the activity of the diaphragm, chest wall, and other accessory muscle of respiration.  xxxd1934xxx  exerts stimulatory effects both peripherally and centrally.

sites of action
evidence for the central site of action
the initial report of  xxxd1934xxx ’s effect as a respiratory stimulant in dogs found that this
effect was not abolished by sectioning the sinus or vagus nerves but was abolished by high
spinal cord transection (c2) (53). this finding implied that brainstem respiratory centers,
but not peripheral chemoreceptors were stimulated by  xxxd1934xxx . polak and plum recorded increased activity of brainstem inspiratory and expiratory neurons in response to

cns drug reviews, vol. 12, no. 3–4, 2006

 xxxd1934xxx  (41). direct electrophysiologic study of the effects of  xxxd1934xxx  on feline and
canine brainstem confirmed a strong increase in inspiratory and expiratory neuronal activity following 0.2 to 1 mg/kg boluses (18). these doses had no detectable effect on other
brain regions. at higher doses, up to 40–60 mg/kg,  xxxd1934xxx  caused cortical excitation
and convulsions. these findings correlated well with the estimated safety margin of
20–40:1 for  xxxd1934xxx .

evidence for a peripheral site of action
on the other hand, kato and buckley, using a cross circulation preparation found that
 xxxd1934xxx  stimulated respiration through actions not only on central respiratory centers,
but also through a stimulatory effect on carotid and aortic chemoreceptors (25). these
findings confirmed previous work by hirsh and wang who found a biphasic effect of  xxxd1934xxx  in cats: low dose  xxxd1934xxx  (0.05–0.25 mg/kg) selectively but indirectly activated
medullary respiratory neurons through carotid and aortic chemoreceptor stimulation
whereas at higher doses  xxxd1934xxx  directly and non-selectively stimulated both respiratory
and non-respiratory medullary neurons (22). the combination of selective peripheral input
plus non-selective central activation drove a large increase in brainstem respiratory activity. later, mitchell and herbert demonstrated a predominant peripheral chemoreceptor
effect of  xxxd1934xxx  in cats (34). they found that  xxxd1934xxx  increased carotid body afferent
activity leading to increased phrenic nerve activity equivalent to that produced by severe
arterial hypoxemia (pao2 = 35–40 mm hg).
in summary, the effects of  xxxd1934xxx  in different areas of the respiratory control system
appear to be concentration-dependent. both central (brainstem) and peripheral (chemoreceptors) sites can be stimulated by  xxxd1934xxx  though it is controversial as to which area
displays greater sensitivity. this distinction may now be better understood with the emerging understanding of the molecular neurobiology of the respiratory control apparatus.

molecular neurobiology
role for k2p channels in  xxxd1934xxx  action
recent studies have identified some of the molecular determinants of peripheral chemosensing and respiratory control. analysis of the membrane currents that can be isolated
from carotid glomus (type i) cells, which are the primary chemosensing cell in carotid
body, have found a special role for potassium currents in these cells (39). buckler established that oxygen sensing in the carotid body occurs through the inhibition of a baseline
k+ current that was not inhibited by conventional k+ channel blockers (7). these characteristics conform closely to those members of the k2p channel family responsible for background k+ currents (54). background potassium channels have been found important in
setting the resting membrane potential of cells and to control the overall excitability of
neurons in the cns. there are fifteen family members identified in the human genome
that have been divided functionally and by sequence into six subfamilies (table 1) (reviewed in ref. 20).
 xxxg1257xxx  and  xxxg1258xxx  (for twik-related acid sensitive k channel) are members of the
family whose activities are regulated by ph changes within the normal physiologic range.
in addition,  xxxg1257xxx  and  xxxg1258xxx  activities are modulated by oxygen levels.  xxxg1257xxx  and

 xxxg1258xxx  are known to be expressed in carotid bodies and the brainstem (56). acidic ph
values and hypoxia inhibit  xxxg1257xxx  and  xxxg1258xxx  channel function, while volatile anesthetics such as halothane and isoflurane enhance their currents (33,38). these data implicate k2p channels in the mechanisms of both ventilatory regulation and volatile anesthetic action. an oxygen-sensitive k+ current can be recorded from carotid body type 1
cells that have many but not all of the hallmarks of  xxxg1257xxx  (54). brainstem respiratory
neurons also express task channels (4) where they may participate in regulating neuronal excitability changes caused by ph changes.
 xxxd1934xxx  stimulates carotid body through the same molecular mechanisms as hypoxemia. takahashi et al. compared the effects of  xxxd1934xxx  and hypoxia on isolated-perfused
carotid bodies in rabbits (52).  xxxd1934xxx  stimulated the carotid body in a dose-dependent

manner and had an additive but not synergistic effect on the carotid body response to hypercapnia. various potassium (k+) channel modulators were also studied. only halothane,
an activator of k2p channels reduced the response to hypoxia. agents acting on katp and
ca+2-activated k channels had no effect. this report supports a role for k2p channels in
carotid body chemosensing and that  xxxd1934xxx  acts through these channels.
cotten et al. recently established that  xxxd1934xxx  has potent direct inhibitory effects on
cloned  xxxg1257xxx  and  xxxg1258xxx  channels (12).  xxxd1934xxx  inhibited  xxxg1257xxx  (half-maximal
effective concentration [ec50], 410 nm),  xxxg1258xxx  (ec50, 37 ìm), and  xxxg1257xxx / xxxg1258xxx 
heterodimeric channel function (ec50, 9 ìm). other k2p channels required significantly
higher drug concentrations for inhibition. the inhibitory concentrations were well within
the therapeutic range for  xxxd1934xxx  and indicated that  xxxg1257xxx  and  xxxg1258xxx  are plausible
molecular targets for the ventilatory effects of  xxxd1934xxx .
therefore, it seems likely that at least some of the respiratory stimulant effects of  xxxd1934xxx  are mediated through task k2p channels. clearly, other neurotransmitter pathways
including serotonergic and noradrenergic elements integrate into central respiratory
control, but k2p channels appear to be basic cellular elements mediating the response to
respiratory stimuli. these channels are expressed in the cells and tissues that control respiration. their response to chemosensory input, inhibition by acidosis and hypoxia results in
changes in carotid body output. in addition, the respiratory depression produced by volatile anesthetics may also be mediated by these channels by blunting the signaling that
occurs in response to acidosis and hypoxia. volatile anesthetic activation of  xxxg1257xxx  and
 xxxg1258xxx  would produce hyperpolarization and inhibition of the neural tissues in which
they are expressed.
the study by knill and gelb from the 1970s is particularly interesting in understanding
this interaction (27). they studied the ventilatory response to hypoxia, hypercapnia and
 xxxd1934xxx  in humans receiving halothane. they found that halothane strongly blunted the
increased respiratory response to  xxxd1934xxx  and to hypoxia but had scant effect on the
respiratory response to hypercarbia. interpreted in light of the current knowledge of molecular pharmacology of k2p channels, these observations imply that volatile anesthetic inhibition of respiratory control occludes the peripheral (carotid body) targets of  xxxd1934xxx 
and hypoxia ( xxxg1257xxx  and  xxxg1258xxx ); however central respiratory drive responsive to
hypercarbia, mediated perhaps by other mechanisms, remains intact.

effect on neuromuscular transmission
improvement in respiration after anesthesia could also occur through a peripheral
action of augmenting respiratory muscle function, especially if muscle relaxants had been
administered. pollard et al. studied the action of  xxxd1934xxx  on neuromuscular transmission
in the rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation (42).  xxxd1934xxx  augmented neuromuscular
transmission in a dose-related manner above a threshold concentration of 50 ìm. in vitro
study of the effect of  xxxd1934xxx  on the activity of the acetylcholinesterase in rat diaphragm
found no inhibitory effect in the concentration range that augmented neuromuscular transmission, excluding cholinesterase inhibition as the underlying mechanism. however, in
the presence of partial neuromuscular block, a dose-dependent depression of neuromuscular transmission with  xxxd1934xxx  was found. in this respect  xxxd1934xxx  was most effective in
the presence of neuromuscular blocking agents that have predominant presynaptic effect
(â-bungarotoxin and  xxxd3456xxx ). this study suggests that  xxxd1934xxx  has a presynaptic
facilitatory action at the neuromuscular junction. in the presence of partial neuromuscular

243

block, an inhibitory action is revealed that may be post-junctional. however the concentrations of  xxxd1934xxx  at which these effects occurred were approximately five times higher
than those reached in plasma after a standard clinical dose.
it appears, therefore, that  xxxd1934xxx  may affect to some extent the recovery from neuromuscular block and its effect will depend on whether muscle relaxants with predominant
pre-synaptic or post-synaptic effects are used. cooper et al. found that, in humans, spontaneous twitch height recovery was significantly delayed by  xxxd1934xxx  for a muscle relaxant
with a postsynaptic action (vecuronium), whereas there was no change in recovery for a
muscle relaxant with a presynaptic action (atracurium) (11).  xxxd1934xxx  had also no effect
on twitch height recovery when the reversal agent neostigmine was used (11,37). thus,
the effect of  xxxd1934xxx  on neuromuscular transmission appears to be relatively minor and
probably not clinically significant.

clinical studies
use as a stimulant in respiratory failure
 xxxd1934xxx  has found use in the past as a temporary measure in patients with acute respiratory insufficiency generally superimposed on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
edwards and leszczynski compared  xxxd1934xxx  with four other respiratory stimulants
(amiphenazole, nikethamide, ethamivan, and prethcamide) and found  xxxd1934xxx  to be the
most effective agent in reversing hypercapnia and hypoxemia (15). the landmark study by
moser et al. in 1973 demonstrated that  xxxd1934xxx  could aid in the management of acute respiratory decompensation (acute respiratory acidosis) in patients with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (35). the increase in ventilation has been found to be due in equal
parts to an increase in tidal volume and frequency of ventilation (8).
some traditional texts have proposed the use of  xxxd1934xxx  for weaning from mechanical ventilation and advocated  xxxd1934xxx  as the best agent available since it shows minimal
tachyphylaxis. an intravenous infusion of 1–8 mg/min has been suggested to be started
just before discontinuing ventilatory support (36). the infusion may be continued for
several days with gradual reduction of the infusion rate over time. however its use, at least
in the u.k., has declined probably due to the greater efficacy of other techniques such as
nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation as a temporizing measure in respiratory
failure (2).
 xxxd1934xxx  has also been proposed as a useful treatment for obstructive sleep apnea.
houser and schlueter reported successful treatment of a morbidly obese patient with moderate respiratory distress by continuous infusion of  xxxd1934xxx  for 14 days (23). controlled
clinical trials of this use have not followed but given the rapid increase in morbid obesity
in many countries and its association with obstructive sleep apnea, renewed interest in
 xxxd1934xxx  for this indication may arise.

perioperative actions
post-anesthesia
as described above, winnie and collins used  xxxd1934xxx  as a “pharmacologic ventilator” in reviving patients following general anesthesia (55).  xxxd1934xxx  not only stimu-

lates respiration but also arouses patients and has been used for post-anesthetic use as well
as for emergency department treatment of drug-induced cns depression (43). numerous
animal and human studies in the 1970s confirmed that  xxxd1934xxx  improves arousal and
level of consciousness following anesthesia induced by barbiturates, volatile anesthetics,
nitrous oxide and benzodiazepines. a  xxxd1934xxx  infusion improved oxygenation and reduced the incidence of pulmonary complications in patients recovering from upper and
lower abdominal surgery (14,19,30).  xxxd1934xxx  also increased arousal and shortened recovery time in patients having outpatient surgery (44).

prevention of shivering
finally, a little known role for  xxxd1934xxx  in terminating post-operative shivering was
found in 1993 (48). the effectiveness of  xxxd1934xxx  to prevent shivering on emergence
from general anesthesia was compared to that of demerol. sixty patients who shivered
after routine surgery under general anesthesia were allocated randomly to receive normal
saline (n = 20),  xxxd1934xxx  1.5 mg/kg (n = 20), or demerol 0.33 mg/kg (n = 20). both  xxxd1934xxx  and demerol were effective in treating postoperative shivering 2–3 min after intravenous administration. in the group who received normal saline, 15 patients were still
shivering 10 min after treatment, while in the  xxxd1934xxx  group only three patients were
shivering at that time. in the demerol group, all patients had stopped shivering within
7 min of receiving the drug. therefore, both  xxxd1934xxx  and demerol were effective in the
treatment of postoperative shivering, with demerol being perhaps slightly better. however,
a more recent study has shown that  xxxd1934xxx ’s effect on shivering threshold is minor,
lowering the shivering threshold in normal volunteers by only 0.5°c (28).

use in apnea of the newborn
since the 1970s, the first-line treatment for apnea of immaturity has been methylxanthines (theophylline or caffeine), the efficacy of which in preventing apneas has been well
documented (39,47).  xxxd1934xxx  has also been used more recently for controlling apneas
unresponsive to methylxanthines alone. a cochrane review of the literature found only a
few randomized, placebo-controlled trials comparing  xxxd1934xxx  and methylxanthines (21,
41). based on these few studies in a small number of patients, there is no significant difference between  xxxd1934xxx  and the methylxanthines. some treated newborns continue to
have frequent spells of apnea and needed more vigorous ventilatory techniques such as
nasal continuous positive airway pressure or mechanical ventilation. additionally, several
undesirable side effects such as hyperactivity, irritability, alteration of sleep, tachycardia,
metabolic, gastrointestinal, and urinary disorders have been noticed in infants treated with
 xxxd1934xxx . a significant side effect of  xxxd1934xxx  is an increase in blood pressure which
could enhance the risk of cerebral hemorrhage.
furthermore, benzyl alcohol, the preservative in  xxxd1934xxx  has been implicated in
a fatal syndrome in premature infants. neonates suffered cardiovascular collapse and
death associated with metabolic acidosis, thrombocytopenia, gasping respirations, central
nervous system depression, hepatic and renal failure due to benzyl alcohol poisoning. the
toxic threshold was determined to be 130 mg/kg/day (5). the largest source of the benzyl
alcohol arose from the preservative in flush solution used to keep intravenous access open
and elimination of this source has eliminated the problem. nevertheless, some neonatal

cns drug reviews, vol. 12, no. 3–4, 2006

 xxxd1934xxx 

245

units have excluded all drugs containing benzyl alcohol despite the potential benefit of
these drugs. calculation of the amount of benzyl alcohol administered, based on the concentration of benzyl alcohol and the volume given indicate that there may be acceptable
risk of a small amount of preservative versus the benefit of  xxxd1934xxx  (31). for  xxxd1934xxx ,
if administered at recommended infusion rates of 2–2.5 mg/kg/h the current formulation
would deliver 21–27 mg/kg per 24 h, which would be considered safe.
a recent case-control study reported that decreased mental capacity in very low birth
weight infants that had been treated with  xxxd1934xxx  correlated with the amount of
 xxxd1934xxx  they had received (49). the mechanism of this decrease is unclear. nevertheless, the available literature supports a limited role for  xxxd1934xxx  to increase respiratory
drive in premature infants.

side effects
the most common side effects of  xxxd1934xxx  are relatively minor. the following symptoms were reported to occur in less than 5% of patients receiving the drug: cough, dyspnea, tachypnea, headache, dizziness, apprehension, hypertension, flushing, sweating,
nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, urinary retention, and muscle spasticity.

neurologic effects
 xxxd1934xxx  should probably not be used in patients with epilepsy or other convulsive
disorders. there is some controversy whether  xxxd1934xxx  is proconvulsant. electroencephalograpic arousal in dogs sedated with halothane was reliably produced by  xxxd1934xxx 
(46). however  xxxd1934xxx  did not intensify seizures in rats that were elicited by electrical
stimulation (1). these authors also compared  xxxd1934xxx  to the known convulsant pentylenetetrazol and anticonvulsants phenobarbital and diazepam (1). they found that  xxxd1934xxx 
produced no change in seizure threshold in this model whereas ptz lowered and phenobarbital and diazepam raised the threshold, as expected. in humans,  xxxd1934xxx  has been
associated with cns excitation, especially in the setting of liver failure where drug metabolism may be impaired. baxter reported four cases of sustained agitation following the administration of  xxxd1934xxx  in icu patients with some degree of liver insufficiency (3).  xxxd1934xxx  is contraindicated in patients with evidence of head injury or cerebral vascular
accident because its cardiovascular stimulatory effect could worsen the neurologic status.
however,  xxxd1934xxx  has been used to stimulate ventilation in a brain damaged infant
without causing a change in intracranial pressure (17).

cardiac effects
the cardiac effects of  xxxd1934xxx  in humans are mild, perhaps less so than in dogs,
which may reflect species differences. a mild pressor effect, more marked in hypovolemic
than in normovolemic states (26) is probably due to release of catecholamines. critically
ill patient in the intensive care unit (icu) demonstrated a 25% increase in cardiac output
with  xxxd1934xxx , an effect best explained by an increase in cardiac contractility (26). a
latter study found no change in blood pressure or hemodynamics in patients given
 xxxd1934xxx  following thoracic surgery (29). cardiac rhythm disturbances have occasionally

cns drug reviews, vol. 12, no. 3–4, 2006

been seen in patients receiving  xxxd1934xxx . huffington and craythorne saw ventricular
ectopy in 3 of 17 patients given  xxxd1934xxx , but in two of them, the arrhythmias had
occurred before  xxxd1934xxx  administration (24). stephen and talton identified non-life
threatening dysrhythmias in five of twenty-nine patients given  xxxd1934xxx  under general
anesthesia using older anesthetic agents (cyclopropane, ether,  xxxd2604xxx ) (50). in
contrast, no rhythm changes were identified in one hundred adults receiving  xxxd1934xxx  in
an outpatient surgery setting (44). therefore,  xxxd1934xxx  appears safe in most clinical settings, including icu patients although  xxxd1934xxx  may still be considered contraindicated
in those with significant cardiovascular impairment or severe hypertension.
more serious rhythm disturbances have been seen in infants. de villiers et al. described
three neonates who developed second degree heart block, possibly related to prolonged
qt interval during the administration of high dose  xxxd1934xxx  (13). a follow-up study
found that  xxxd1934xxx  infusion to neonates caused mild lengthening of the q-t interval
(32). however, six of forty infants studied developed qtc (corrected qt interval)
>440 msec, a length considered a significant risk for life-threatening arrhythmias. accordingly, heart monitoring is recommended when  xxxd1934xxx  is given to premature infants.

drug interactions
administration of  xxxd1934xxx  to patients who are receiving sympathomimetics or monoamine oxidase inhibiors may result in an additive pressor effect.  xxxd1934xxx  does not
appear to interact with anesthetic agents that sensitize the heart to catecholamines, such as
halothane (50). in patients who have received muscle relaxants,  xxxd1934xxx  may temporarily mask the residual effects of muscle relaxant drugs.

contraindications
due to its benzyl alcohol content,  xxxd1934xxx  injection is contraindicated in prematurely
born neonates.  xxxd1934xxx  is also contraindicated in patients with mechanical disorders of
ventilation such as mechanical obstruction, flail chest, pneumothorax, acute bronchial
asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, or other restrictive lung diseases as the increase in respiratory
drive does not address the primary pathophysiologic problem and may worsen respiratory
fatigue.

conclusions
the fundamental understanding of  xxxd1934xxx ’s mechanism of action has recently
emerged. these studies have provided new insight into the control and regulation of
breathing. however,  xxxd1934xxx  continues to have a limited role in clinical medicine. at
one time its ability to improve respiration and consciousness following general anesthesia

was significantly useful but as safer and shorter-acting anesthetic agents have arrived, the
need for  xxxd1934xxx  in the recovery room has declined. similarly, the use of  xxxd1934xxx  in
the intensive care unit, whether in adults or neonates with respiratory insufficiency is also
reduced, having been supplanted by other agents or techniques. whether  xxxd1934xxx  could
find a new niche in the management of patients with obstructive sleep apnea remains to
be seen.
