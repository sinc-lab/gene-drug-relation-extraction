as a ligand for peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor g ( xxxg1807xxx ), troglitazone inhibits cell growth
by mechanisms besides activating  xxxg1807xxx . in this study, we found that troglitazone interfered with the
interactions between estrogen-related receptor a and g (erra and  xxxg733xxx ) and their coactivator  xxxg1807xxx 
coactivator-1a (pgc-1a) functioning as an  xxxd1422xxx . additionally, troglitazone suppressed the
expressions of pgc-1a and its related member pgc-1b which are key regulators of mitochondrial
function. consequently, troglitazone reduced mitochondrial mass and suppressed the expressions of
superoxide dismutases to elevate reactive oxygen species (ros) production. the increase in ros in turn
induced the expression of cell cycle inhibitor p21waf1. we therefore propose that erra and  xxxg733xxx  are
alternative targets of troglitazone important for mediating its growth suppressive effect.

1. introduction
troglitazone was sold as an anti-diabetic agent until its
withdrawal due to liver toxicity issues [1]. in addition to its
therapeutic use in treating diabetes, troglitazone has also been
investigated as a chemotherapeutic agent. speciﬁcally, troglitazone arrests cell growth or induces apoptosis in a variety of cancer
cell lines through enhancing the expressions of cell cycle inhibitor
p21waf1 and dna repair enzyme  xxxg851xxx  [2,3].
since troglitazone binds to and activates peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor g ( xxxg1807xxx ),  xxxg1807xxx  has been suggested to
be a potential therapeutic target not only for diabetes but also for
cancers [4].  xxxg1807xxx  is a member of the nuclear  xxxg1603xxx 
super-family of transcription factors that regulate the expression
of target genes in dna sequence speciﬁc and ligand selective
manners [5].  xxxg1807xxx  binds to structurally distinctive ligands such
as troglitazone through its c-terminally located ligand binding
domain (lbd) [6].
however, the role of  xxxg1807xxx  in cancer is still incompletely
understood and controversial. first of all, the potencies of different
ligands to activate  xxxg1807xxx  do not directly correlate to their abilities
to inhibit cancer cell growth. namely, more potent agonists do not
necessary inhibit cancer cell growth strongly. secondly, an
antagonist of  xxxg1807xxx   xxxd1216xxx  does not block the abilities of
 xxxg1807xxx  agonists to inhibit growth in certain cancer cell lines [7,8].

thirdly, in  xxxg1807xxx  knock out mouse embryonic ﬁbroblast cells,
troglitazone still strongly induces cell cycle arrest [9]. moreover,
troglitazone actually increases the number of small intestinal
polyps in a genetic colon cancer model [10,11]. importantly, a
phase ii clinical trial using  xxxg1807xxx  agonist rosiglitazone to treat
breast cancer patient was prematurely terminated due to
unsatisfactory results [12]. collectively, these evidences raise
the question whether the anti-cancer effects of certain  xxxg1807xxx 
ligands are primarily mediated through  xxxg1807xxx . intriguingly, the
thiazolidinedione class of  xxxg1807xxx  ligand such as ciglitazone,
rosiglitazone, and troglitazone suppress cell growth through
inducing reactive oxygen species (ros) production [13]. however,
the mechanism responsible for this thiazolidinedione-induced ros
production is not well understood.
estrogen-related receptor a and g (erra and  xxxg733xxx ) are
constitutively active members of the nuclear  xxxg1603xxx 
super-family [14]. erra and  xxxg733xxx  are thought to regulate
mitochondrial biogenesis and energy homeostasis together with
their coactivators  xxxg1807xxx  coactivator-1a and -1b (pgc-1a and
pgc-1b) [15]. as their names suggested pgc-1a and pgc-1b are
coactivators for  xxxg1807xxx  in addition to erra and  xxxg733xxx  [16,17],
implying that these receptors can crosstalk at the level of their
common coactivators. in fact, competition for a limiting amount of
coactivators also known as ‘‘squelching’’ may account for one of the
mechanisms behind the crosstalk among different members of the
nuclear  xxxg1603xxx  super-family. in this study, we
examined if troglitazone would affect erra and  xxxg733xxx  activities
by measuring its effects on err-mediated transcriptional regulation, coactivator interaction, and mitochondrial function. instead
of relying simply on coactivator squelching, we found that

troglitazone suppressed the activities of erra and  xxxg733xxx  by
directly functioning as their inverse agonists.

2.5. quantitative real-time pcr

2. materials and methods

total rna extraction, ﬁrst-strand cdna generation, and
quantitative real-time pcr analysis were performed as described
[21]. the sequences of primers are listed in supplemental data.

2.1. plasmids and chemicals

2.6. mitochondrial mass assay

the  xxxg2041xxx -pgc-1a- and pgc-1b-promoter reporter plasmids
were cloned by pcr ampliﬁcation of their 2 kb genomic regions
upstream of their respective transcriptional start sites into pgl3luciferase vector (promega, madison, wi, usa). troglitazone,
estrogen, 4-oh tamoxifen, and  xxxd1216xxx  were purchased from
cayman chemical (ann arbor, mi, usa).  xxxg2156xxx -790 was synthesized
and puriﬁed as described [18]. manganese(iii) 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4- xxxd306xxx )porphyrin (mntbap) was purchased from
calbiochem (san diego, ca, usa).

mitochondrial mass measured by staining with mitotracker
green (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa) was performed as described
[22]. brieﬂy, cells were incubated in serum free medium (prewarmed to 37 8c) with 150 nm mitotracker green fm for 20 min in
the dark. after staining, cells were washed twice with cold
phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and suspended in 200 ml pbs.
subsequently, cells were analyzed on a fac-scalibur (bd
biosciences, san jose, ca, usa) ﬂow cytometer with excitation
at 490 nm and emission at 516 nm. data were processed by using
the cellquest program (bd biosciences, san jose, ca, usa).

2.2. cell culture and cell growth assay
2.7. reactive oxidant species (ros) assay
human lung adenocarcinoma a549 cells were purchased from
american type culture collection (atcc, manassas, va, usa) and
grown in rpmi-1640 medium (gibco, carlsbad, ca, usa)
supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (fbs) (hyclone,
guangzhou, china), 1 penicillin/streptomycin (gibco, carlsbad,
ca, usa), and maintained at 37 8c and 5% co2. for cell growth
assay, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5000 cells/
well with or without compounds added. after treatment of
indicated time, cell growth was measured by using celltiter-glotm
kit (promega, madison, wi, usa).

the determination of ros was based on the oxidation of 2,7dichlorodihydroﬂuorescin (dchf-da) (beyotime jiangsu china) by
peroxide as described [23]. in brief, cells were washed and
incubated with dcfh-da for 20 min at 37 8c in the dark. cells were
then washed twice and harvested in pbs. the ﬂuorescence of 2,7dichloroﬂuorescein (dcf) was detected with a ﬂow cytometer
(fac-scalibur, bd biosciences) with excitation at 488 nm and
emission at 530 nm. data were processed by using the cellquest
program (bd biosciences).

2.3. transfections

2.8. western blot analysis

transient transfections were performed using lipofectamine
2000 (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. for luciferase reporter assays, cells at 85–95%
conﬂuency in 96-well plates were cotransfected with reporter
plasmids (25 ng/well), renilla luciferase (3 ng/well) as an internal
control for transfection efﬁciency and appropriate mammalian
expression vectors (25 ng/well). six hours after transfection, cells
were treated with drugs for 24 h. luciferase activity was measured
as described [19,20].

cells were lysed using ripa reagent (shenneng, shanghai,
china) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and protein
extracts were analyzed by 10% sds-page and blotted onto pvdf
membrane. membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-humanpgc-1a or -1b antibodies (cell signaling technology, boston, ma,
usa) or anti-b-actin antibody (boster, wuhan, china) followed by
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (amersham, piscataway, nj, usa) and developed with beyoecl plus
reagent (beyotime, guangzhou, china).

2.4. receptor and coactivator interaction analysis

2.9. statistical analysis

interactions between his6-tagged-erra- or  xxxg733xxx -lbd with
pgc-1a or  xxxg1512xxx  coactivator peptides in the presence of different
ligands were analyzed by a biacore 3000 system as described
[19,20]. human his6-tagged-erra- or  xxxg733xxx -lbd protein was
expressed in escherichia coli bl21(de3) with 0.5 mm iptg
induction at 18 or 15 8c for 20 h and puriﬁed to more than 95%
pure by a ni-nta column (qiagene, valencia, ca, usa). biotinylated pgc-1a peptides: eepslakkaalapan (nr2 negative control); eneanllavltetld (nr1); eepsllkklllapan (nr2); and
rpcsellkylttndd ( xxxg965xxx ) were captured onto streptavidin immobilized surface of sa chip in ﬂow cells 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
erra- or  xxxg733xxx -lbd in running buffer (50 mm tris ph 8.0, 150 mm
nacl, 1 mm mgcl2, 0.002% np-40, 0.2 mm dtt) were injected into
ﬂow cells for 3 min at a ﬂow rate of 20 ml/min at 25 8c. changes in
resonance units (ru) were monitored simultaneously in all ﬂow
cells. surface was regenerated at the end of each cycle by an
injection of 0.05% sds. sensorgrams were generated by biacontrol
software 4.1 using double-referencing to eliminate responses from
the reference surface and buffer-only control. speciﬁc changes in
ru were generated with non-speciﬁc interaction between lbd and
nr2 negative control mutant peptide deducted.

assays done in triplicate were repeated at least three times.
data are presented as mean  se and analyzed by a variance test
(anova).
3. results
3.1. troglitazone induces growth arrest in a ros-dependent manner
although several clinical trials using troglitazone to treat
advanced stage cancers were not effective [24], a large scale
retrospective study nonetheless suggested that troglitazone
reduces lung cancer risk [25]. we therefore ﬁrst investigated if
the troglitazone-mediated growth inhibition was dependent on
activating  xxxg1807xxx  in lung cancer a549 cells. we found that
troglitazone dose-dependently inhibited the growth of a549
(fig. 1a); however, the  xxxg1807xxx  antagonist  xxxd1216xxx  failed to block
this growth suppressive effect of troglitazone (fig. 1a) even though
it reversed the  xxxg1807xxx  transcriptional activity induced by
troglitazone (supplemental data fig. s1). on the other hand,
troglitazone dose-dependently induced the accumulation of ros
which could be blocked by an anti-oxidant mntbap (fig. 1b) but

doses of troglitazone or dmso as a control for another 48 h before cell growth assay. dmso treatment was set as 100%. (b and c) after a pre-treatment with 200 mm mntbap

1. (d) different doses of mntbap were added for 3 h prior to the addition of 50 mm troglitazone or dmso as a control for another 48 h before cell growth assay. (e and f) after a
pre-treatment with 200 mm mntbap, different doses of troglitazone or dmso as a control were added in the presence or absence of mntbap for another 24 h before rna
collection. the expression levels of p21waf1 (e) and  xxxg851xxx  (f) were measured by real-time pcr with 18s rrna as a control. the relative expression level of gene with
dmso was set at one. (a–f) results represent mean  sd of three independent experiments. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 for troglitazone compared to dmso; #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01
for  xxxd1216xxx  or mntbap addition compared to troglitazone alone.

not by the  xxxg1807xxx  antagonist  xxxd1216xxx  (fig. 1c). importantly, the
troglitazone-mediated growth inhibition was reversed by mntbap
(fig. 1d). consistently, the ability of troglitazone to induce the
mrna expression levels of cell cycle inhibitor p21waf1 and dna
repair enzyme  xxxg851xxx  were blocked by mntbap (fig. 1e and f).
these data collectively suggested that the mechanism of troglitazone-mediated growth inhibition is not solely dependent on
activating  xxxg1807xxx  but on inducing ros instead.
3.2. troglitazone alters mitochondrial function
since mntbap functions as an anti-oxidant through mimicking
the action of superoxide dismutase, we then tested if aberrant
expressions of superoxide dismutases 1 and 2 (sod1 and sod2) are
related to the ability of troglitazone to induce ros. we measured
and found that troglitazone reduced the mrna expression levels of
sod1 and sod2 (fig. 2a). we then investigated into the
mechanism responsible for the down-regulation of these enzymes.
the mrna expression levels of sod1 and sod2 are in part
controlled by coactivator pgc-1a [26]. we then found that the
mrna expression level of pgc-1a was suppressed by 50 mm

troglitazone (fig. 2b); whereas, the mrna expression level of a
related family member pgc-1b was suppressed by troglitazone in
a dose-dependent manner (fig. 2b). consistently, the protein level
of pgc-1b was more strongly reduced by troglitazone compared to
pgc-1a and b-actin as a control (fig. 2c). these transcriptional
coactivators are key controllers of mitochondrial biogenesis [27],
down-regulation of their expression would be expected to affect
mitochondrial mass. we indeed found that troglitazone dosedependently suppressed mitochondrial mass (fig. 2d). this
reduction of mitochondria mass was not blocked by the antioxidant mntbap (fig. 2d), suggesting that the reduction is not a
result of the increase in ros. importantly, this suppressive effect
on mitochondrial mass was not blocked by  xxxg1807xxx  antagonist
 xxxd1216xxx  (fig. 2e), indicating that this troglitazone-mediated
suppression is independent of activating  xxxg1807xxx .
3.3. troglitazone suppresses the transcriptional activities of
erra and  xxxg733xxx 
since the troglitazone-suppressed pgc-1a and pgc-1b expression is correlated to its effects on inducing ros and arresting

experiments. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 for troglitazone compared to dmso; #p < 0.05 for  xxxd1216xxx  or mntbap addition compared to troglitazone alone.

growth, we next investigated into the mechanism behind
suppressing their expression levels. the expression levels of a
luciferase reporter under the control of pgc-1a- and pgc-1bpromoters were enhanced by erra [28]. troglitazone may
suppress the activity of erra to reduce the expressions of pgc1a and pgc-1b. we found that over-expressing erra enhanced
the expression of a pgc-1a-promoter luciferase reporter and this
erra-driven expression was dose-dependently suppressed by
troglitazone (fig. 3a). since the dna binding speciﬁcity of  xxxg733xxx  is
similar to that of erra, we also found that over-expressing  xxxg733xxx 
enhanced the expression of the pgc-1a-promoter luciferase
reporter although to a lesser extent compared to erra and
troglitazone dose-dependently inhibited this  xxxg733xxx -driven expression (fig. 3a). intriguingly,  xxxg733xxx  enhanced the expression of a pgc1b-promoter luciferase reporter better than erra (fig. 3b). both
erra- and  xxxg733xxx -driven pgc-1b-promoter luciferase reporter
expressions were dose-dependently suppressed by troglitazone
with the  xxxg733xxx -driven expression being more sensitive (fig. 3b).
these troglitazone-mediated inhibitions were not due to a nonspeciﬁc effect on transcription in general when cells are undergoing arrest as troglitazone did not signiﬁcantly affect the
estradiol-induced transcriptional activity of  xxxg730xxx  b
(supplemental data fig. s2). these evidences suggested that
troglitazone speciﬁcally down-modulates the activities of both

erra and  xxxg733xxx . indeed, using another promoter which can be
regulated by both erra and  xxxg733xxx , we also conﬁrmed that
troglitazone dose-dependently suppressed the erra- and errgdriven expressions (supplemental data fig. s3).
3.4. troglitazone suppresses the interactions between erra and
 xxxg733xxx  with coactivators
since troglitazone suppressed the activities of erra and  xxxg733xxx 
in a similar manner to their respective inverse agonists  xxxg2156xxx -790
[18] and 4-oh tamoxifen [29], we next asked if troglitazone would
affect the abilities of erra- and  xxxg733xxx -lbd to interaction with
coactivators. by a surface plasmon resonance (spr) assay, we
previously established that ﬂavonoids apigenin and kaempferol
are erra and  xxxg733xxx  inverse agonists [19,20]. using this spr assay,
we found that troglitazone inhibited the interaction between  xxxg733xxx 
with the nr2 receptor interacting motif of pgc-1a similar to 4-oh
tamoxifen as a positive control (fig. 4a and supplemental data fig.
s4). in addition, we also found that troglitazone inhibited the
interaction between  xxxg733xxx  with another receptor interacting motif
on coactivator  xxxg1512xxx  (fig. 4b). using  xxxg2156xxx -790 as a positive control,
similar observation was obtained with erra (fig. 4c). since this in
vitro analysis only utilized puriﬁed receptor ligand binding domain
and coactivator receptor interacting motif peptide, we concluded

and b) a549 cells were transiently transfected with a pgc-1a- (a) or pgc-1b- (b)
promoter luciferase reporter plasmid, expression plasmids of erra or  xxxg733xxx , and an
internal control renilla luciferase plasmid. dmso, 10, 20, or 50 mm of troglitazone
was added for 24 h before luciferase assay. the activity of luciferase was normalized
to that of renilla luciferase to obtain relative activity. fold inductions of the relative
activity with dmso as a control were shown. all transfection experiments were
performed in triplicate wells and each experiment had been repeated at least three
times. results represent mean  sd. #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01 for erra or  xxxg733xxx 
expression plasmid compared to control expression plasmid; *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01
for troglitazone compared to dmso.

that troglitazone binds to the ligand binding domain directly and
inhibits the abilities of these receptors to interact with coactivators. in other words, troglitazone is an  xxxd1422xxx  of erra and
 xxxg733xxx .
4. discussion
troglitazone and other thiazolidinediones (tzds) have been
shown to be effective therapeutic agents for diabetes [1]. recently,
several of these tzds have been suggested to be potential
therapeutic agents for cancers due to their growth suppressive
effects in vitro and in some cases in vivo [4]. since tzds are thought
to mediate their therapeutic effects through speciﬁcally activating
 xxxg1807xxx ,  xxxg1807xxx  has then been suggested to suppress tumor growth
[4]. although the role of  xxxg1807xxx  in tzd-mediated cancer cell
growth inhibition is controversial, tzds seem to arrest cell growth
through inducing ros [13]. our results conﬁrmed that ros is a key
to the troglitazone-mediated growth inhibition. importantly, we

fig. 4. troglitazone suppresses the interactions between erra and  xxxg733xxx  with
coactivators. (a) dmso, 1 mm 4-oh tamoxifen, or different doses of troglitazone
was incubated with 50 nm  xxxg733xxx -lbd before detecting its interaction with the
receptor interacting motif (nr2) of pgc-1a. (b) dmso, 1 mm 4-oh tamoxifen, or
different doses of troglitazone was incubated with 75 nm  xxxg733xxx -lbd before
detecting its interaction with the receptor interacting motif (nr1) of  xxxg1512xxx . (c)
dmso, 20 mm  xxxg2156xxx -790, or different doses of troglitazone was incubated with
500 nm erra-lbd before detecting its interaction with  xxxg1512xxx  nr1 motif.

uncovered another facet of the mechanistic action of troglitazone;
i.e., suppression of erra and  xxxg733xxx  activities.
while troglitazone has been clearly demonstrated to activate
 xxxg1807xxx , we demonstrated that troglitazone also suppresses the
activities of erra and  xxxg733xxx . besides affecting erra and  xxxg733xxx 
activities, troglitazone has also been demonstrated to downregulate  xxxg730xxx  signaling in breast cancer cells [30,31].
the mechanism behind this effect appears be related to
troglitazone’s ability to promote  xxxg730xxx  alpha protein
degradation in a  xxxg1807xxx  independent manner [32]. alternatively,
transcriptional coactivator squelching has been suggested to be a
mechanism by which nuclear hormone receptors mediate their
transrepressive effects on each other. it is conceivable that
troglitazone activates  xxxg1807xxx  and squelches limiting amount of
coactivator away from erra and  xxxg733xxx , resulting in a suppression

y. wang et al. / biochemical pharmacology 80 (2010) 80–85

of their activities. however, the fact that troglitazone does not
signiﬁcantly affect the activity of  xxxg730xxx  b, which also
utilizes a similar set of coactivators [33], suggests that squelching
does not play an important role in troglitazone’s suppressive
effects on erra and  xxxg733xxx  activities.
instead, using a highly puriﬁed in vitro system, we demonstrated that troglitazone inhibits the abilities of these receptors to
interact with their coactivators making troglitazone an inverse
agonist for both erra and  xxxg733xxx . as a dual erra and  xxxg733xxx  inverse
agonist, troglitazone suppresses not only the erra- and errgdriven pgc-1a and pgc-1b expressions but also the pgc-1a- and
pgc-1b-governed mitochondrial biogenesis and anti-oxidative
enzyme expression, promoting the production of ros which
induces the expressions of cell cycle inhibitor p21waf1 and dna
repair enzyme  xxxg851xxx . these observations are similar to what
we had established for erra  xxxd1422xxx   xxxg2156xxx -790 [34].
noticeably, over-expression of erra is associated with adverse
clinical outcomes in several different types of cancer [35]; thus,
suppressing its activity may represent a novel way of treating
cancer. therefore, we suggest that troglitazone inhibits cell growth
in part through suppressing the activities of erra and  xxxg733xxx .
