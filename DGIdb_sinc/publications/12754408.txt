abstract
antirheumatic gold compounds have been shown
to inhibit  xxxg1559xxx  activation by blocking  xxxg463xxx 
(ikk) activity. to examine the possible inhibitory
mechanism of gold compounds, we expressed wild
type and mutant forms of ikkalpha and beta subunits in
cos-7 cells and determined the effect of gold on
the activity of these enzymes both in vivo and in
vitro. substitution of cys-179 of ikkbeta with alanine
(c179a) rendered the enzyme to become resistant
to inhibition by a gold compound  xxxd248xxx , however, similar protective effect was not observed
with an equivalent level of ikkalpha (c178a) mutant
expressed in the cells.  xxxd248xxx  inhibited constitutively active ikkalpha and beta and variants; ikkalpha
(s176e, s180e) or ikkbeta (s177e, s181e), suggesting that gold directly cause inhibition of activated
enzyme. the different inhibitory effect of  xxxd248xxx 
on ikkalpha (c178a) and ikkbeta (c179a) mutants indicates that gold could inhibit the two subunits of
ikk in a different mode, and the inhibition of  xxxg1559xxx  and ikk activation induced by inflammatory
signals in gold-treated cells appears through its
interaction with cys-179 of ikkbeta.

introduction
the transcription factor  xxxg1559xxx  plays a critical role in
the regulation of genes involved in chronic inflammatory diseases (barnes and karin, 1997). in unstimulated cells,  xxxg1559xxx  is sequestered in the cytoplasm
through interaction with inhibitory proteins called ikappab
( xxxg1561xxx , beta and epsilon).  xxxg1559xxx  is activated in response to
many signals including proinflammatory cytokines such
as il-1 and tnf, bacterial lps, virus, ultraviolet light,
and oxidants (baeuerle and henkel, 1994; barnes and
karin, 1997). these signals cause phosphorylation and
subsequent degradation of ikappab proteins, and the released  xxxg1559xxx  enters the nucleus to induce expression
of specific target genes. in the signal pathway for
 xxxg1559xxx  activation, phosphorylation of ikappab is likely to
be the central point of regulation. previous studies
identified an  xxxg463xxx  (ikk) complex of 700 kda,
which is induced by inflammatory signals and able to
phosphorylate two conserved n-terminal serine residues of  xxxg1561xxx  and ikappabbeta (didonato et al., 1997; mercurio et al., 1997). ikk complex is composed of two
catalytic subunits, ikkalpha (or  xxxg463xxx ) and ikkbeta ( xxxg1159xxx ),
and a regulatory subunit, ikkgamma/nemo/ikkap1 (reviewed in may and ghosh, 1998; zandi and karin,
1999). ikkalpha and ikkbeta are ser/thr kinases of similar
structure which can form homodimers and heterodimers in vitro, and purified recombinant form of each
can directly phosphorylate  xxxg1561xxx  and beta at proper sites
(lee et al., 1998; li et al., 1998; zandi et al., 1998).
the activity of ikkalpha and ikkbeta was shown to depend
on their phosphorylation at specific serine residues
(ser-176/180 of ikkalpha and ser-177/181 of ikkbeta) located in the t (activation) loop of the kinase domain,
and substitution of these sites with glutamate, which
mimic the effect of  xxxd1857xxx , generated constitutively activated form of ikkalpha and ikkbeta (mercurio
et al., 1997; ling et al., 1998). although the similar
structures of ikkalpha and ikkbeta suggest their common
functional role in  xxxg1559xxx  activation, studies with animals deficient in each ikk subunit revealed that ikkalpha
plays a role during embryonic development of the skin
and skeletal system, while ikkbeta is essential for the
activation of ikk in response to tnf and other proinflammatory stimuli (gerondakis et al., 1999; reviewed in zandi and karin, 1999).
gold compounds, comprised of elemental au(i) and
a sulfur-containing ligand, have been used for the
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, inducing improvement of clinical conditions in a majority of patients

(research subcommittee of the empire rheumatism
council, 1960; champion et al., 1990). administration
of a gold compound aurothiomalate to rheumatoid
arthritis patients was shown to reduce expression of
inflammatory cytokines, il-1, il-6 and tnf, in the
synovial membrane (yanni et al., 1994). in lps-stimulated monocytes and macrophages, a lipid-soluble
gold compound  xxxd248xxx  inhibited production of il-1
and tnf by reducing their mrna levels, suggesting
a transcriptional regulation of il-1 and tnf expression by  xxxd248xxx  (bondeson and sundler, 1995). our
previous study showed that  xxxd248xxx  and other thiolreactive metal ions inhibit  xxxg1559xxx  activation by blocking ikk activation in lps-stimulated macrophages
(jeon et al., 2000). these metal compounds and other
thiol-modifying agents such as n- xxxd2684xxx  and
 xxxd2843xxx  directly suppressed ikk
activity in vitro, indicating that these agents inhibit ikk
by modifying a critical cysteine thiol group of the
enzyme molecule. recently, other thiol-reactive agents,
including cyclopentenone pg [pga 1 and 15-deoxy∆12-14-pgj2 (15dpgj2)] and arsenite anion (aso 33-)
were also reported to inhibit  xxxg1559xxx  and ikk activation
in cells stimulated with tnf, il-1, or phorbol esters
(kapahi et al., 2000; rossi et al., 2000). the inhibitory
effect of 15dpgj2 and arsenite was not observed in
cells expressing mutant ikkbeta in which cys-179 in the
activation loop is replaced with alanine, indicating that
they inhibit ikk by modifying cys-179 of ikkbeta. these
results suggest that gold and other thiol-reactive agents
can affect ikk activity reacting with cys-179 of ikkbeta
or cys-178 of ikkalpha.
here, we examined the effect of gold and other
thiol-reactive agents on the activity of various ikkalpha
and ikkbeta mutants expressed in cos-7 cells. ikkbeta
mutant in which cys-179 was substituted to alanine
was resistant to inhibition by  xxxd248xxx , while an equivalent ikkalpha mutant, ikkalpha (c178a), was still susceptible to gold. we also show that various thiol-reactive
agents inhibit constitutive-active forms of ikkalpha and
ikkbeta as effectively as wild type enzymes. our results
reveal that gold blocks ikk activity by reacting with
different sites of ikkalpha and ikkbeta.

 xxxg1073xxx  (gst)- xxxg1561xxx  containing n-terminal 54 residues of  xxxg1561xxx  was prepared by expression in escherichia coli as described previously (jeon
et al., 2000). cos-7 monkey kidney cells were obtained from the american type culture collection (atcc,
manassa, va). cells were grown and maintained in
dmem supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
calf serum, penicillin (100 u/ml) and streptomycin
(100 µg/ml).

expression of ikkalpha and ikkbeta in
cos-7 cells and ikk assay
the expression plasmids prcbetaactin-3xha-ikkalpha encoding wild-type human ha-ikkalpha was kindly provided
by dr. m. karin (university of california, san diego,
ca), and described previously (didonato et al., 1997).
pflagcmv-ikkbeta encoding flag-ikkbeta, and the constructs for constitutively active mutants of ikkalpha and
ikkbeta were kind gifts of dr. f. mercurio (signal pharmaceuticals, san diego, ca) (mercurio et al., 1997).
wild-type  xxxg1559xxx -inducing kinase (nik) construct was
a gift from dr. j.-h. kim (korea university, seoul,
south korea). the cdna for ha-ikkalpha was subcloned
between hindiii and xhoi sites of pcr3.1 (invitrogen,
groningen, netherlands). expression vectors encoding
ikkalpha (c178a) and ikkbeta (c179a) mutants with alanine
instead of cysteine at appropriate sites were prepared
by site-directed mutagenesis using an overlap extension method (ho et al., 1989). mutations were verified
by dna-sequencing analysis. cos-7 cells grown in
12-well plates were transfected with plasmid vectors
and expressed ikk was isolated by immunoprecipitation as described previously (jeon et al., 2000).
in vitro kinase assay was performed with immune
complexes in kinase buffer containing 2-5 µci of
[gamma-32p]atp and gst- xxxg1561xxx  (2 µg). samples were analyzed by sds-page on a 12.5% gel and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (millipore, bedford, ma). phosphorylated gstikappabalpha was visualized by autoradiography and quantitated in a phosphor image analyzer (bas-2500;
fujifilm, tokyo, japan). the membrane was subsequently probed with appropriate antibodies to determine the amount of ikkalpha or ikkbeta.

materials and cell culture
antibodies to ikkalpha (m-280), ikkbeta (h-4), and hemagglutinin (ha) tag (y-11) were obtained from santa

inhibition of ikkbeta by gold occurs
through modification of cys-179
previously, thiol-reactive 15dpgj2 and arsenite were
shown to inhibit ikk by complexing cys-179 of ikkbeta
(kapahi et al., 2000; rossi et al., 2000). to determine
whether gold compounds inhibit ikk also by reacting
with cys-179 of ikkbeta (and equivalent cys-178 of
ikkalpha), cos-7 cells were transfected with expression

constructs for wild type ha-ikkalpha and flag-ikkbeta and
mutants in which the cysteine residues were substituted with alanine. after treatment with various
doses of  xxxd248xxx , cells were lysed and ikk was isolated by immunoprecipitation using anti-tag antibodies.
the immune complexes were used to determine kinase activity with gst- xxxg1561xxx  as a substrate (figure 1).
because ikkalpha and cys→ala variants of ikkalpha and
ikkbeta expressed alone in the absence of stimuli
showed low  xxxg463xxx  activity (jeon et al., 2000;

vectors along with nik expression vector. after 46 h, the cells were
treated for 2 h with 0-30 µm  xxxd248xxx . kinase assay (ka) was performed with immune complex obtained from cell lysate (120 µg protein), and the expression level of enzyme was measured by immunoblotting (ib) with anti-ha antibody. (b) cos-7 cells were transfected
with wild type flag-ikkbeta (ikkbeta wt) or flag-ikkbeta (c179a) (ikkbeta ca)

(20 µg protein) was used for kinase assay and immunoblotting
analysis. ikk activity was determined by measuring the radioactivity
of gst- xxxg1561xxx  by phosphor image analysis and calculated as a percent
of control (lower histogram). the results are presented as mean±sd

data not shown), an ikk-activating kinase, nik, was
coexpressed with ikkalpha or ikkbeta. our result revealed
that  xxxd248xxx  inhibited both wild type ha-ikkalpha and
mutant ha-ikkalpha (c178a) in a similar way (figure 1a).
by contrast, a remarkable difference in their susceptibility to  xxxd248xxx  was detected between wild
type flag-ikkbeta and c179a mutant of ikkbeta (figure
1b). the wild type ikkbeta-flag was inhibited by  xxxd248xxx  in a dose-dependent manner, and enzyme activity was reduced by more than 80% at 30 µm
 xxxd248xxx . however, no inhibitory affect was seen in
cells expressing flag-ikkbeta (c179a) treated with 10
and 30 µm  xxxd248xxx .
previous studies showed that gold and other thiolreactive agents directly inhibit ikk complex in vitro
(jeon et al., 2000; kapahi et al., 2000; rossi et al.,
2000). we thus examined whether cys-178 of ikkalpha
and cys-179 of ikkbeta are involved in inhibition of ikk
after exposure of enzyme to gold compounds and
other thiol-reactive agents in vitro. wild type and
c178a and c179a mutants of ikkalpha-ha and ikkbetaflag, respectively, were expressed in cos-7 cells,
and isolated by immunoprecipitation. the immune complex was used to determine ikk activity in the presence or absence of various concentrations of hydrophilic gold compound, aurothiomalate, a reducing agent
dithiothreitol, and other thiol-blocking agents such as
n- xxxd2684xxx  and 15dpgj2 (figure 2). addition of
thiol-modifying agents, aurothiomalate, n- xxxd2684xxx  and 15dpgj2 inhibited ikkalpha and beta activity dosedependently, while decreasing concentrations of dithio-

ha-ikkalpha (c178a) (ikkalpha ca), wild type flag-ikkbeta (ikkbeta wt), or
flag-ikkbeta (c179a) (ikkbeta ca), together with nik expression vector.
after 48 h, cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-tag antibodies, and equal aliquots of immune complex were assayed for ikk
activity in the absence (lanes 1 and 8) or presence of various concentrations of aurothiomalate (atm, 10, 30, and 100 µm, lane 2-4),
dithiothreitol (dtt, 300, 100, and 0 µm, lane 5-7), n- xxxd2684xxx 
(nem, 0.1, 0.3, and 1 mm, lane 9-11), and 15dpgj2 ( xxxd1209xxx  2, 3, 10,
and 30 µm, lane 12-14). the data represent two experiments.

threitol in the reaction mixture reduced enzyme activity. 15dpgj2 inhibited ikkbeta to 35% of control at 3
µm concentration and no additional inhibition was observed at increasing concentrations of 15dpgj 2. mutant enzymes ikkalpha (c178a) and ikkbeta (c179a) were
also sensitive to inhibition caused by addition of thiolreactive agents or depletion of reducing agent in the
reaction mixture.

effect of thiol-reactive agents on constitutively
active variants of ikkalpha and beta
the ikkalpha and ikkbeta are activated by phosphorylation
of serine residues in their activation loops by upstream kinases and autophosphorylation (mercurio et
al., 1997; ling et al., 1998; delhase et al., 1999).
these serine residues are located near the cys-178
and cys-179 of ikkalpha and beta, respectively, indicating
a possibility that thiol-reactive agents inhibit ikk activation by interfering with phosphorylation of these
serine residues. to test this possibility, we used constitutively active ikkalpha and beta variants, ha-ikkalpha (s176e,
s180e) and flag-ikkbeta (s177e, s181e), in which the
two phospho-acceptor serine residues in the activation

along with nik expression vector and treated with  xxxd248xxx  as
described in figure 1. kinase assay (ka) was performed with immune

antibody. (b) cos-7 cells were transfected with wild type flag-ikkbeta

loop were substituted with glutamate. cos-7 cells
transfected with wild type or constitutively active mutants of ha-ikkalpha and flag-ikkbeta were treated with
 xxxd248xxx  for 2 h, and ikk activity of immunoprecipitated enzyme was measured (figure 3).  xxxd248xxx 
inhibited both wild type and constitutively active forms
of ha-ikkalpha and flag-ikkbeta.

discussion
in this study, we examined whether the inhibitory effect of gold compounds on ikk activity occurs through
modification of cys-178 and cys-179 of ikkalpha and beta,
respectively. previously, cys-179 of ikkbeta has been
shown to be involved in inhibition of ikk by cyclopentenone pgs and arsenite (kapahi et al., 2000;
rossi et al., 2000). our result showed that when an
ikkbeta mutant that contains alanine instead of cys-179
was expressed in cos-7 cells, it was resistant to
inhibition by a cell-permeable gold compound,  xxxd248xxx , indicating that gold inhibits ikk by modifying
cys-179 of ikkbeta. our result agrees with the previous
results obtained with cyclopentenone pgs and arsenite, confirming a role of cys-179 of ikkbeta as a common target for various thiol-reactive agents. by
contrast, this protective effect of cys→ala mutation
was not observed in cells expressing an equivalent
ikkalpha mutant, ikkalpha (c178a). these results demonstrate a critical difference in catalytic and regulatory
mode of enzyme activity between ikkalpha and ikkbeta,
despite their identical substrate specificity and homologous structures. genetic analysis of ikk function
revealed that ikkalpha-deficient mice display abnormalities in skin and limb development, whereas deletion
of ikkbeta gene causes embryonic death due to massive
liver apoptosis and ikkbeta-deficient cells are sensitive
to tnf-induced apoptosis (reviewed in gerondakis et
al., 1999; zandi and karin, 1999). moreover, studies
with these knockout mice showed that  xxxg1559xxx  and ikk
activation in response to tnf and il-1 are severely
impaired in ikkbeta-deficient cells, whereas inactivation
of ikkalpha gene had less effect. taken together, these
results indicate an essential role of ikkbeta in ikk and
 xxxg1559xxx  activation by proinflammatory signals, and suggest that anti-inflammatory effect of gold compounds
appear mainly through modification of cys-179 of
ikkbeta.
we observed that ikkalpha (c178a) mutant was
inhibited by  xxxd248xxx  as effectively as wild type ikkalpha.
this result suggested that gold compounds inhibit
ikkalpha by reacting with group(s) other than cys-178 in
ikkalpha. our result also showed that in vitro exposure
of mutant enzymes, including ikkbeta (c179a), to thiolreactive agents reduced enzyme activity in a similar
way to wild type enzymes. this result also suggested

inhibition of ikk beta by gold

the presence of group(s) in the ikkbeta molecule other
than cys-179, which is(are) sensitive to oxidation or
modification by reactive agents. this sensitive site of
ikkbeta (c179a) seems to be protected from inhibition
by gold inside the cell, where redox balance maintains a more reduced state and competing thiols are
more abundant than in vitro assay system. in a previous study, in vitro incubation of protein phosphatase
1b with reactive oxygen species, such as h 2o 2 or
superoxide anion (o 2 ), has been shown to induce
oxidation at multiple sites in addition to cys-215,
which acts as a specific regulatory site for reactive
oxygen species in the cell (barrett, 1999).
cys-179 is critically positioned within the activation
loop of ikkbeta, suggesting that modification of this
residue can interfere phosphorylation of adjacent
ser-177 and ser-181 and thus activation of enzyme.
we tested this possibility by employing constitutively
active versions of ikkalpha and ikkbeta, in which the two
serine residues were replaced with acidic glutamate
residues. our result showed that the mutant enzyme
of ikkalpha and ikkbeta were inhibited by  xxxd248xxx  in a
similar degree with wild type enzymes (figure 3).
gold compounds and other thiol-reactive agents were
also shown to directly inhibit activated ikk isolated
from cells stimulated with lps or tnf (jeon et al.,
2000; kapahi et al., 2000; rossi et al., 2000). these
results suggest that the modification of cys-179 by
gold and other thiol-reactive agents interfere formation
of active conformation of ikk even when the two
serine residues are in phosphorylated state and cys179 plays a pivotal role in the conversion of inactive
enzyme to an active form.
in summary, our results show that antirheumatic
gold compounds inhibit  xxxg1559xxx  activation by modifying
cys-179 of ikkbeta, and the effect appears through
direct inhibition of activated enzyme.  xxxg1559xxx  controls
the expression of diverse inflammatory and immune
response mediators, and the abnormal, constitutive
activation of  xxxg1559xxx  has been associated with numerous chronic inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease,
ulcerative colitis and atherosclerosis (barnes and
karin, 1997). understanding the inhibitory mode gold
compounds in ikk activation will benefit development
of novel strategies to treat these diseases.
