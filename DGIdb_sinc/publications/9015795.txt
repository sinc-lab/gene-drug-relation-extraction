atypical neuroleptics have low affinity for
dopamine d 2 receptors or are selective
for d 4 receptors
philip seeman, m.d., ph.d., roy corbett, ph.d., and hubert h. m. van toi, ph.d.

this review examines the possible receptor basis of the
atypical action of those atypical antipsychotic drugs that
elicit low levels of parkinsonism. such an examination
requires consistent and accurate dissociation constants for
the antipsyclwtic drugs at the relevant dopamine and
serotonin receptors. it has long been known, however, that
the dissociation constant of a given antipsychotic drug at
the dopamine d 2 receptor varies between laboratories.
although such variation depends on several factors, it has
recently been recognized that the radioligand used to
measure the competition between the antipsychotic drug
and the radioligand is an important variable. the present
review summarizes information on this radioligand
dependence. in general, a radioligand of low solubility in
the membrane (i.e., low tissue:buffer partition) results in a
low value for the antipsychotic dissociation constant when
the drug competes with the radioligand. hence, by first
obtaining the antipsychotic dissociation constants using
different radioligands of different solubility in the
membrane, one can then extrapolate the data to low or
"zero" ligand solubility. the extrapolated value represents
the radioligand-independent dissociation constant of the
antipsychotic. these values are here given for dopamine d 2
and d4 receptors, as well as for serotonin 5-ht2a receptors.
these values, rnoreover, agree with the dissociation constant
directly obtained with the radioactive antipsychotic itself.

for example, clozapine revealed a radioligand-independent
value of 1.6 nm at the  xxxg658xxx , agreeing with
the value directly measured with [3h]-clozapine at d4.
however, because clozapine competes with endogenous
dopamine, the in vivo concentration of clozapine (to occupy
dopamine d4 receptors) can be derived to be about 13 nm,
agreeing with the value of 12 to 20 nm in the plasma water
or spinal fluid observed in treated patients. the atypical
neuroleptics  xxxd3096xxx , clozapine, perlapine, seroquel,
and melperone had low affinity for the dopamine d 2
receptor (radioligand-independent dissociation constants of
30 to 90 nm). such low affinity makes these latter five
drugs readily displaceable by high levels of endogenous
dopamine in the caudate or putamen. most typical
neuroleptics have radioligand-independent values of 0.3 to
5 nm at dopamine d 2 receptors, making them more
resistant to displacement by endogenous dopamine. finally,
a relation was found between the neuroleptic doses for rat
catalepsy and the d2:d4 ratio of the radioligandindependent k values for these two receptors. thus, the
atypical neuroleptics appear to fall into two groups, those
that have a low affinity for dopamine d 2 receptors and those
that are selective for dopamine d4 receptors. © 1997

receptor hypotheses for atypical
neuroleptic action
the blockade of dopamine d 2 receptors alleviates psychosis but also produces parkinsonism (seeman et al.
1974, 1975; creese et al. 1976; seeman 1992a, 1995a). antipsychotic drugs (neuroleptics) that elicit few or none
of the extrapyramidal signs of parkinsonism are referred to as atypical antipsychotic drugs (meltzer and
nash 1991). what is the receptor basis for this atypical
action of these particular neuroleptics? there are several current views:
1. some atypical neuroleptics may have a low affinity

for dopamine d2 receptors and may thus be readily
displaced by high endogenous concentrations of
dopamine in the caudate or putamen.
2. atypical neuroleptics may block both dopamine d 2
receptors and muscarinic receptors.
3. atypical neuroleptics may have a balanced block of
dopamine d 2 receptors and serotonin2a (5-ht2a) receptors (meltzer 1989, 1995; leysen et al. 1994; huttunen 1995).
4. atypical neuroleptics may selectively block dopamine d4 receptors.
we examined these various hypotheses after first
considering the values for the neuroleptic dissociation
constants at the dopamine d 2, d 4, and 5-ht2a receptors.

the neuroleptic dissociation
constant varies with the tissue:
buffer partition of the radioligand
to derive the therapeutic receptor-blocking concentrations of neuroleptics and to assess the different hypotheses for atypical neuroleptic action, it is essential to use
neuroleptic dissociation constants that have been measured with the minimum experimental artifacts.
for example, it has been found that the dissociation
constant of a neuroleptic (e.g. [3h]-spiperone) can range
from 30 pm up to 1,600 pm as the final concentration of
tissue is increased (seeman et al. 1984). currently, however, the final concentrations of tissue in most laboratories is kept very low to minimize tissue dependence.
although many other factors may also determine the
dissociation constant of an antipsychotic drug at various
receptors, the literature on this topic is not extensive.
the ph, for example, determines not only the surface
activities (seeman and bialy 1963) and the membrane:
buffer partition coefficients of neuroleptics (seeman
1966a, 1966b; seeman and weinstein 1966; seeman and
kwant 1969), but also the dissociation constant of the
neuroleptic at the dopamine d 2 receptor (e.g., sulpiride;
presland and strange 1991). the surface charge of the

neuropsychopharmacology 1997-vol. 16, no. 2

membrane also determines the membrane:buffer partition coefficient of neuroleptics (kwant and seeman 1969),
as does the membrane lipid composition (kwant and
seeman 1971). many of these physicochemical factors,
including temperature, that affect the partition of the
neuroleptic in the membrane have been previously reviewed (seeman 1972). as for the role of physicochemical factors on the dissociation constant of agonists and
antagonists, the sodium and  xxxd2531xxx  concentrations determine the proportion of the dopamine d 2 receptors that are in the high-affinity state (grigoriadis
and seeman 1985; watanabe et al. 1985). sodium also is
essential for the high-affinity binding of benzamide
neuroleptics to dopamine receptors (jarvie et al. 1987).
nevertheless, despite standard laboratory experimental conditions internationally (e.g., ph of 7.4 and
physiological concentrations of na+, mg++, and other
ions), it has long been known that the dissociation constant of a particular neuroleptic may vary considerably
between laboratories, particularly when different radioligands are used. for example, the dissociation constant
for clozapine at the dopamine d 2 receptor is approximately 150 nm (range 70-400 nm), when using [3h]spiperone as a radioligand (seeman 1992a). however,
when [3h]-raclopride is used as the radioligand, the dissociation constant for clozapine at d 2 is between 35 and
60 nm (malmberg et al. 1993).
recently, therefore, this dependence of the neuroleptic dissociation constant on the radioligand was studied
in more detail (seeman and van tol 1995; seeman
1995b). it was found that the neuroleptic dissociation
constant depended on the tissue:buffer partition coefficient of the radioligand. a similar finding has recently
been made by durcan et al. (1995).
for example, clozapine at the  xxxg656xxx  revealed a
dissociation constant of 390 nm with [3h]-nemonapride,
186 nm with [3h]-spiperone, and 83 nm with [3h]-raclopride. haloperidol also had a dissociation constant of
9.6 nm at dopamine d 2 receptors using [3h]-nemonapride, 2.7 nm using [3h]-spiperone, and 0.67 nm using [3h]-raclopride. these neuroleptic dissociation constants were related to the tissue:buffer partition coefficients of the radioligands, as shown in figures 1 and 2.

the radioligand-independent
dissociation constant
it is possible to eliminate the dependence of the neuro-

leptic dislocation constant on the radioligand and thereby
obtain the dissociation constant of the neuroleptic in the
absence of any competing radioligand. this may be
done by extrapolating the relation shown (figure 2)
down to either unity or zero partition, yielding an intercept. this intercept represents the dissociation constant

figure 2. using data of the sort shown in figure 1, the dissociation constant (k value) for a neuroleptic at a given receptor
depends on the tissue:buffer partition of the fh]-ligand. extrapolating down to the intercept yields the radioligand-independent dissociation constant. this value represents the dissociation constant for the neuroleptic in the absence of any competing [ 3h]-ligand and is therefore referred to as the radioligand-independent dissociation constant. the [3h]-ligands for the
serotonin  xxxg1113xxx  (rat cerebral cortex) were: ['h]- xxxd2419xxx  (*k) and [3h]-spiperone (*sc). the [3h]-ligands for the
human cloned  xxxg656xxx  were [ 3h]-nemonapride (*n) (formerly emonapride or ym-09151-2), [3h]-spiperone (*s) or [3 h]raclopride (*r). the data using either dzshort (bunzow et al. 1988; owolabi et al. 1994) or d:ztong (o'dowd ct al. 1990; in cos-7
cells) yielded identical k values for each neuroleptic. the [3h]-ligands for the human cloned  xxxg658xxx  (van toi et al. 1991)
were [ 3h]-nemonapride, [3h]-spiperone, or [3h]-sandoz glc756 (*g) (markstein et al., 1996). the data using either d4.2 or
d4.7 (van toi et al. 1992) yielded identical dissociation constants for each neuroleptic. the number of independent measurements is given beside each point. the tissue:buffer partition coefficients for the phi-ligands were for the postmortem human
caudate nucleus (see figure 1), except that for *kand *sc, which were based on the rat cerebral cortex. using partition coefficients based on the [3h]-ligands partitioning between tissue culture cells and buffer yielded essentially similar results for the
radioligand-independent dissociation constants (seeman and van tol 1995). note that the dissociation constantsk,1 using [3h]-

chlorpromazine, [3h]-clozaprine, and [3h]-haloperidol were
identical to the radioligand-independent dissociation constants for chlorpromazine, clozapine, and haloperidol, respectively. the kd values of these [3h]-neuroleptics are shown at a
low partition (zero) because the [3h]-ligand does not compete
with any other compound for binding to the receptor.

of the neuroleptic in the absence of any competing radioligand. thus, a low partition or a partition of "zero"
indicates that the neuroleptic would be competing
against a water-soluble radioligand with low or negligible partition and that would be readily displaced by the
neuroleptic.
several examples of this approach are shown in figures 2a-2c. thus, the extrapolated dissociation constant (or radioligand-independent dissociation con-

stant) for clozapine at dopamine 0 4 receptors is 1.6 nm,
in agreement with the value of 1.5 nm as directly measured with [3 h]-clozapine at the dopamine 0 4 receptor
(see figure 2a). this value, moreover, agrees with that
found by kusumi et al. (1995a, 1995b) for a dopamine
orlike binding site labeled by [3h]-clozapine in the rat
frontal cortex.
it is important to note this identity between the radioligand-independent dissociation constant (figure 2)
and the dissociation constant (kd) as determined directly using the [3h]-neuroleptic. this identity holds for
3
3
[ h]-chlorpromazine, [3h]-clozapine, and [ h]-haloperidol, as shown in figure 2a, as well as for [3h]- xxxd3195xxx 
(figure 2c). the kd values of these [3h]-neuroleptics are
shown at a low partition (zero) because the [3h]-ligand
does not compete with any other compound for binding
to the receptor.
the extrapolated radioligand-independent dissociation constant is not a new parameter in any way. it
merely is the dissociation constant of the competing
nonradioactive compound that would be obtained if
very high volumes of incubation were used (seeman
and van tol 1995; seeman 1995b). for example, when
the volume of incubation was increased from the customary 1.5 ml to a larger volume of 8 ml, the radioligand-dependence of the competing nonradioactive
drug was considerably reduced but not eliminated
(seeman and van tol 1995; seeman 1995b). the dependence of the dissociation constant on the partition coefficient of the radioligand does not arise from depletion
of the radioligand, because no depletion occurs (seeman and van tol 1995; seeman 1995b). in fact, when
very high volumes of 10 ml are used, the radioligand
dependence may disappear, and the dissociation constant of the radioactive drug appears to agree with the
dissociation constant of the competing nonradioactive
drug (malmberg et al. 1996). the radioligand dependence is not a result of inadequate time of equilibration,
as identical results were obtained when the standard incubation period of 2 hours was extended to either 4 or 6
hours (seeman and van tol 1995; seeman 19956).
a summary of the radioligand-independent dissociation constants for 17 neuroleptics at the dopamine 0 2
receptor (cloned), the dopamine 0 4 receptor (cloned),
and the serotonin 5-ht2a (rat cortex) receptor is given
in table 1.

drug selectivity is ligand-dependent
an examination of the data in figure 2 indicates that
the receptor selectivity of a drug depends on the radioligands used. for example, the data in figure 2b for
olanzapine show that olanzapine has a radioligandindependent dissociation constant of 2 ± 0.4 nm at the

dopamine d 4 receptor. this value is statistically significantly lower than that of 3.7 ± 0.6 nm for the dopamine
d 2 receptor and lower than that of 5.8 ± 0.7 nm for the
 xxxg1113xxx . however, if only the data for olanzapine using [3h]-spiperone were considered, then olanzapine would be viewed as preferring the  xxxg1113xxx  (see figure 2b). selectivity is here defined as a
statistically significant preference of the neuroleptics
for one receptor over another, as examined by their radioligand-independent dissociation constants (table 1).
the receptor selectivities of haloperidol and isoclozapine (figure 2a) also depend on the ligand considered.

neuroleptics with high and low
affinity for the dopamine d 2 receptor
the data in table 1 indicate that the neuroleptic values
for the radioligand-independent dissociation constants
fall into two groups, those that have high values at
dopamine d 2 receptors (between 30 and 90 nm) and
those that have low values (between 0.3 and 5 nm).

clozapine therapeutic concentration,
as derived from the radioligandindependent dissociation constant at
the dopamine d 4 receptor
one important example of the usefulness of the value
for the radioligand-independent dissociation constant
is that it may be used to derive the therapeutic concen-

tration of a neuroleptic. for example, although the data
in figure 2 show that clozapine has a radioligand-independent dissociation constant of 1.6 nm at the dopamine d 4 receptor, clozapine in vivo must compete with
endogenous dopamine in the synapse, estimated to be
of the order of 10 nm (kawagoe et al. 1992). hence, the
in vivo concentration of clozapine for 50% occupation
of dopamine d 4 receptors may be derived from the
commonly used cheng-prusoff equation (cheng and
prusoff 1973; munson and rodbard 1988). thus, the in
vivo concentration of clozapine for 50% occupation of
dopamine d 4 receptors would be approximately equal
to k x [1 + di 6.2 nm]), or 4.2 nm, where k is the radioligand-independent dissociation constant of 1.6 nm for
clozapine (figure 2), d is the synaptic concentration of
the order of 10 nm, and where 6.2 nm is the dissociation
constant of dopamine at the high-affinity state of the
 xxxg658xxx  (table 2 in asghari et al. 1994).
we previously used the value of 50 nm for the synaptic concentration of dopamine (seeman and van tol
1995). this value of 50 nm, however, was from ross
(1991), who estimated it by an indirect method of in
vivo competition of tritiated dopamine agonists and
comparing the results with in vitro competition by
dopamine. the value of 10 nm, however, was obtained
more directly by kawagoe et al. (1992) and is used,
therefore, in this present review. this value for 10 nm,
moreover, refers to the dopamine concentration that is
time-averaged for a frequency of 5 hz over a distance of
2 microns. in addition, although we previously used the
value of 16 nm for the high-affinity state of dopamine at
the dopamine d 4 receptor (seeman and van tol 1995),
the more recent value of 6.2 nm is based on 18 experi-

neuropsychopharmacology 1997-vol. 16, no. 2

ments for the different variants of 0 4 (table 2 in asghari et al. 1994).
this approximate synaptic concentration of 4.2 nm
clozapine, however, only applies for the blockade of
50% of the dopamine 0 4 receptors. hence, the synaptic
concentration of clozapine required to block 75°/4, of the
dopamine 0 4 receptors will be three times higher, or
about 13 nm. [actually, the clinical requirement to
block 75% of the dopamine receptors to achieve antipsychotic action applies to the occupation of dopamine
02 receptors (farde et al. 1992). the percent occupancy
of dopamine 0 4 receptors required for the clinical control of psychotic symptoms is not yet known.]
this predicted in vivo concentration of 13 nm clozapine for 75°/c, occupation of dopamine 0 4 receptors compares to an observed value in the plasma water or spinal
fluid of treated patients of between 12 and 20 nm (olesen et al. 1995; see references and analysis in seeman
1992a), using 1.85% as the proportion of free (unbound)
clozapine in the plasma (table 1 in seeman 1992a).
these considerations (as well as those below in parkinson's disease) do not prove but only suggest that
clozapine might be clinically operative at the dopamine
0 4 receptor, despite the fact that clozapine is known to
bind to many receptors. at the very least, these calculations indicate that dopamine 0 4 receptors are at least
75% occupied by clozapine under therapeutic conditions.

therapeutic concentrations of other
neuroleptics
using the same considerations for haloperidol, it can be
shown that the haloperidol therapeutic concentration
required for 75% blockade of dopamine dz receptors in
vivo will be approximately 2 to 3 nm, using the radioligand-independent dissociation constant of 0.35 nm
(table 1; figure 2). this predicted value of 2 to 3 nm
haloperidol agrees with the observed value in the spinal fluid (or plasma water) of between 1 and 3 nm (table 1 in seeman 1992a). approximately 75% to 80% of
the brain dopamine 0 2 receptors are occupied (wolkin
et al. 1989; nyberg et al. 1995) by 1 nm haloperidol in
the plasma water, using 8.5% as the average proportion
of free (i.e., unbound) haloperidol in the plasma (seeman 1992a).
furthermore, using this same type of calculation for
the antipsychotics listed in table 1, it may be shown
that the molarity for 75% blockade of dopamine 0 2 receptors (and allowing for competition with endogenous
dopamine) results in a final concentration of antipsychotic drug that matches that found in patients (i.e., the
concentration in the plasma water or in the spinal
fluid). for example, using this calculation,  xxxd3096xxx 
yields a molarity of 235 nm; the value observed in pa-

tients is 200 nm (seeman 1992a). molindone yields a
value of 47 nm; the value observed in patients is 50 nm
(seeman 1992a). chlorpromazine yields a value of 5.2
nm; that found in patients is 6 nm (seeman 1992a).
raclopride yields a value of 5 nm; that found in patients is 3 nm (seeman 1992a). thioridazine yields a
value of 3.1 nm; that found in patients is 3 nm (seeman
1992a). in effect, therefore, these radioligand-independent dissociation constants at the dopamine 0 2 receptor, when corrected for competition with endogenous
dopamine and with allowance made for 75% occupation of dopamine 0 2 receptors, closely match the free
neuroleptic concentrations in the patient's plasma water, as previously shown using other radioligands (seeman 1992a; seeman et al. 1976).

deriving the clozapine therapeutic
concentration in l-dopa psychosis in
parkinson's disease
parkinson's disease provides a second important example of the usefulness of radioligand-independent dissociation constants. in excellent agreement with the findings of meltzer et al. (1995), who measured plasma
clozapine in parkinson's patients who had become psychotic on l-dop a, the clozapine concentration (in the
plasma water or spinal fluid) for 75% blockade of
dopamine 0 4 receptors can be derived to be approximately 1.7 nm (using the previous equation, where dis
known to be less than 5% of normal). this value is in
agreement with the value of approximately 1.2 nm
found by meltzer et al. (1995), after allowance is made
for clozapine binding to plasma proteins (see above).

clozapine occupation of dopamine
receptors, as seen by positron
tomography
a third important example of the principle shown in
figure 2 is the resolution of different positron tomography findings in the proportion of dopamine d 2 receptors occupied by clozapine in humans. the data in figure 2, using [1h]-raclopride and [3h]-spiperone, may
explain why clozapine occupies 48% of the dopamine
0 2 receptors in patients when measured with [ 11 c]raclopride (parde et al. 1992, 1994; nordstrom et al.
1994), but between 0% and 22% when measured with
[1 8 f]-methylspiperone (karbe et al. 1991) or [1 8f]-fluoroethylspiperone (louwerens et al. 1993). by graphing the
percentage of 0 2 receptors occupied by clozapine versus the tissue:buffer partition of the radioligand, it is
possible to extrapolate to "zero" partition, as is done

100 p. seeman et al.

neuropsychopharmacology 1997-vol. 16, no. 2

with the in vitro data (figure 2). thus, the percentage of
0 2 receptors occupied by clozapine is extrapolated to
approximately 85%, if using a radioligand of "zero"
partition (e.g., radiodopamine). under clinical conditions, therefore, in the absence of any radioligand, clozapine occupies high levels of 0 2 receptors in neuroleptic-treated patients (seeman and kapur, submitted).
the antipsychotic action of clozapine may stem, therefore, from its occupation of high levels of 0 2, 0 4, or
5-ht2a receptors.

receptor bases for atypical
neuroleptic action

the different receptor hypotheses for the clinically
atypical action of the atypical neuroleptics may now be
examined using the values for the radioligand-independent dissociation constants.

neuroleptics displaceable by endogenous
dopamine
the first group are those atypical neuroleptics that have
low affinity for dopamine 0 2 receptors and thus may be
readily displaced by high endogenous concentrations of
dopamine in the caudate or putamen, as depicted in
figure 3. this group includes  xxxd3096xxx , clozapine,
perlapine, seroquel, and melperone, all of which have
very high values (30-90 nm; table 1 ) for their radioligand-independent dissociation constants. this is in
contrast to most typical neuroleptics that have radioligand-independent dissociation constants of 0.3 to 5 nm
(table 1). molindone is borderline with a radioligandindependent dissociation constant of 6 nm (table 1). of
the 12 atypical neuroleptics listed by roth et al. (1995),
nine have dissociation constants (using [3h]-spiperone)
that are between 45 and 1,584 nm, suggesting that these
compounds would be readily displaced at the dopamine 0 2 receptor by high local concentrations of endogenous dopamine in the striatum. of the 11 typical neuroleptics tested by roth et al. (1995), 10 have dissociation
constants (using [3h]-spiperone) that are between 0.06
and 8 nm, suggesting that these compounds would be

less readily displaced at the dopamine 0 2 receptor by
high local concentrations of endogenous dopamine in
the striatum.
it should first be noted that the therapeutic concentrations (in spinal fluid or plasma water) of  xxxd3096xxx 
and molindone are identical to the concentrations that
block 75% of the dopamine 0 2 receptors (seeman 1992a,
1995b, 1995c), as noted. thus,  xxxd3096xxx  and molindone are not exceptions to the general rule that therapeutic levels of neuroleptics occupy dopamine 0 2 receptors (with the exception of clozapine, which prefers
dopamine 0 4 receptors; seeman 1992a, 1995b).
however, the high radioligand-independent dissociation constants of 30 to 90 nm for these atypical drugs
indicates that they are loosely attached to the dopamine
0 2 receptors and may, therefore, be readily displaced
by endogenous dopamine. the principle of displacement of a neuroleptic by endogenous dopamine has
been shown for [3h]-raclopride (seeman et al. 1989a;
young et al. 1991), [11 c]-raclopride (dewey et al.
1992, 1993a, 1993b; innis et al. 1992; wong et al. 1995),
3
[ h]-spiperone and [3h]-methylspiperone (de jesus et
al. 1986; seeman et al. 1989a; young et al. 1991), [18f]n-methylspiperone (logan et al. 1991; dewey et al.
1991), and [1231]-iodobenzamide (innis et al. 1992;
laruelle et al. 1995a, 1995b).
neuroleptics with high dissociation constants have
low tissue:buffer partition values and are more extensively displaced by endogenous dopamine than neuroleptics with low dissociation constants that have high
tissue:buffer partition values (seeman et al. 1989a). the
five atypical neuroleptics  xxxd3096xxx , clozapine, perlapine, seroquel, and melperone would be expected to
be readily displaced by endogenous dopamine, although no experimental work has been reported for
these particular five neuroleptics.
it is reasonable to expect, moreover, variations in the
synaptic dopamine concentration in different brain regions, based on the different concentrations of homovanillic acid (hv a) found in these various regions. for
example, the basal concentration of hv a in the rat stria tum is four times higher than that in the limbic region
(anden and stock 1973) and 20 times higher than that
in the prefrontal cortex (bowers 1984).

limbic
figure 3. dopamine displaces antipsychotic drugs that bind with low affinity to
dopamine d2 receptors in the striatum
(where the dopamine concentration is
high), but not in the limbic regions of the
brain where the dopamine content is low.

neuropsychopharmacology 1997-vol. 16, no. 2

hence, neuroleptics with high dissociation constants
would occupy more dopamine receptors in brain regions that have a low dopamine output (limbic regions,
hypothalamus, and prefrontal cortex), but would occupy fewer dopamine receptors in regions that have
high dopamine output (caudate/putamen) as a result
of the neuroleptic competition with endogenous
dopamine (figure 3). hence, the fraction of dopamine
receptors that are blocked in the caudate/putamen
would be less than the fraction blocked in the nonstriatal regions, with corresponding fewer extrapyramidal
signs than found in the typical neuroleptics that have low
radioligand-independent dissociation constants. these
considerations may explain why seroquel (450 mg) occupies only 27% to 44% of the 0 2 receptors in patients (using [11 c]-raclopride, gefvert et al. 1995) and why clozapine occupies only 48% of the dopamine 0 2 receptors in
patients (using [1 1c]-raclopride, parde et al. 1992, 1994;
nordstrom 1994), than the typical neuroleptics that occupy 70% to 80% of the dopamine 0 2 receptors (parde
et al. 1992, 1994; nordstrom 1994).

combined block of dopamine d 2 receptors and
muscarinic receptors
a second small group of two atypical neuroleptics,
clozapine and thioridazine, strongly block both dopamine 0 2 and muscarinic receptors. clozapine, for example, is of the order of 20- to so-fold more potent in
blocking muscarinic acetylcholine receptors than blocking dopamine 0 2 receptors (see references in seeman
1990), making clozapine an extremely potent anticholinergic drug. clozapine blocks muscarinic receptors between 1.5 (snyder et al. 1974) and 36 nm (clineschmidt et
al. 1979). because anticholinergic drugs have an anti-parkinson action, it might appear that the low values of 1.5 to
36 nm may readily account for the atypical action of clozapine. however, this simple explanation is probably not
correct, because isoclozapine is equally anticholinergic (k
of 11 nm; rupard et al. 1989), yet elicits catalepsy in animals at low doses, in contrast to clozapine. moreover, it
has been argued that the combination of antagonists for
dopamine (i.e., neuroleptic) and acetylcholine (i.e., benztropine) is not as effective in minimizing parkinsonism as
clozapine itself (sayers et al. 1975; kane et al. 1988).
thioridazine also blocks muscarinic receptors at
about the identical concentrations that it blocks dopamine
0 2 receptors (see references in seeman 1990). thus, the
relatively low level of parkinsonism caused by thioridazine may stem from its anticholinergic action.

balanced block of dopamine d 2 receptors and
5-ht2a receptors
a third mechanism that may account for the clinically
atypical action of atypical neuroleptics is that these

atypical neuroleptics and da d 2 and d4 receptors 101

drugs may have a balanced block of 0 2 and 5-ht2 a receptors (meltzer 1989, 1995; leysen et al. 1994; huttunen 1995).
the blockade of serotonin receptors increases the release of dopamine, as measured indirectly by the fall in
[1 1c]-raclopride binding to d2 receptors (smith et al.
1994; dewey et al. 1995; pehek 1995; see additional references on dopamine-serotonin interactions in meltzer
and nash 1991). in tum, therefore, the increased release
of endogenous dopamine displaces some of the neuroleptic from the dopamine 0 2 receptors, thereby alleviating to some extent the parkinsonism caused by the
dopamine 0 2 receptor blockade.
this mechanism (of enhancing dopamine release) may
explain the modest alleviation of neuroleptic-induced
catalepsy (in rats) by ritanserin, a serotonin antagonist
(bligh-glover et al. 1995). this alleviation only occurs,
however, if the catalepsy is submaximum (bligh-glover
et al. 1995), but not if the catalepsy is maximum, as produced by a relatively high dose of haloperidol (wadenberg 1992; jaskiw et al. 1994).
ritanserin has been reported to alleviate neurolepticinduced parkinsonism and akathisia in patients (bersani et al. 1990; miller et al. 1992). however, ritanserin
does not alleviate haloperidol-induced dystonia in
monkeys, unlike clozapine, which is very effective in
reversing this extrapyramidal syndrome (casey 1991,
1993, 1995a, 1995b).
clozapine, the most atypical neuroleptic, also is potent at many other receptors, including 5-ht2c (leysen
1990; kuoppamaki et al. 1993), 5-ht5, and  xxxg1119xxx  receptors (roth et al. 1994), and alpha 1-adrenoceptors (lejeune et al. 1994), but not potent at 5-ht3 receptors
(hoyer et al. 1989). it is possible, therefore, that such
other receptor sites contribute to the atypical action of
clozapine.
overall, however, there is mixed evidence supporting the concept of a balanced block of 0 2 and 5-ht za receptors to account for the low level or absence of parkinsonism by clozapine and other atypical neuroleptics
(seeman 1992b).
to investigate this important 0 2 / 5-ht2a block hypothesis further, the above radioligand-independent dissociation constants (table 1) may be used for these two
receptors. these values at the  xxxg1113xxx  are approximately the same as those reported by others for the
neuroleptic dissociation constants at this receptor, using
3
[ h]- xxxd2419xxx  (leysen et al. 1982; wander et al. 1987).
in principle, the ratio of the neuroleptic radioligandindependent dissociation constants for these two receptors should be related to the dose that elicits either parkinsonism in patients or catalepsy in rats. such doses
vary considerably, depending on how the parkinsonism
or the catalepsy are measured. to test the d 2 :5-ht2a hypothesis, therefore the catalepsy doses as obtained in a
single laboratory would be more meaningful. figure 4

having low affinity for the dopamine d2 receptors ( xxxd3096xxx , perlapine, seroquel, and melperone) that have high radioligand-independent dissociation constants were omitted because these neuroleptics are atypical by virtue of being displaced

104 p. seeman et al.

(top) attempts to relate the radioligand-independent
dissociation constants for the d2:5-ht2a ratio with the rat
catalepsy doses for various neuroleptics using the published catalepsy doses from many laboratories wherein
different criteria were used to measure catalepsy.
figure 5 (top) shows the same type of data, but using
catalepsy doses from a single laboratory (corbett et al.
1995), where the same criteria were used to measure catalepsy for all the neuroleptics tested.
in examining figures 4 (top) and 5 (top), it is important to note that clozapine and isoclozapine have almost
identical selectivity for the  xxxg1113xxx  (compared
to the dopamine 0 2 receptor). nevertheless, isoclozapine elicits catalepsy at about 3 mg/kg, whereas clozapine does not produce catalepsy at 100 mg/kg.
although there is no clear relation between rat catalepsy and the d 2 :5-ht2a ratios of the radioligand-independent dissociation constants (figures 4 and 5), other
studies have found a difference between typical and
atypical neuroleptics in their relative occupancy of
dopamine 0 2 and 5-ht2a receptors (meltzer et al. 1989a,
1989b; matsubara et al. 1993; stockmeier et al. 1993).

selective block of dopamine d 4 receptors
a fourth possible mechanism for atypical neuroleptic
action may be the selective blockade of dopamine 0 4 receptors. there is a relation between the neuroleptic
doses for rat catalepsy and the 0 2:04 ratio of the radioligand-independent dissociation constants. this is shown
in figures 4 (bottom) and 5 (bottom).
an important feature of the data in figure 4 is that
clozapine and isoclozapine are considerably different in
their values for the 0 2 :04 ratio of radioligand-independent dissociation constants, in good relation to their different cataleptic potencies. this stands in contrast to
their identical values for the d 2:5-ht2 a ratios of radioligand-independent dissociation constants, as noted.
roth et al. (1995) also have found that perlapine,
olanzapine, and clozapine are selective for the dopamine 0 4 receptor, compared to the dopamine 0 2 receptor.
although  xxxd3195xxx  is only now beginning to be
tested in large numbers of patients, it has been reported
that it does not elicit parkinsonism (daniel et al. 1995;
wallin et al. 1995). the low level or absence of extrapyramidal signs with  xxxd3195xxx  might be related to its
ability to block dopamine 0 2 and dopamine 0 4 receptors equally well, as illustrated in figure 2c and shown
in table 1).
the clinical role of dopamine 0 4 receptors may be
clarified when the new drselective drugs (kulagowski
et al. 1996; tenbrink et al. 1996) are developed and
tested on psychotic patients. the blockade of dopamine
0 4 receptors by these drselective drugs may or may
not be associated with clinical antipsychotic action.

neuropsychopharmacology 1997-vol. 16, no. 2

however, if such dopamine drselective drugs do not
turn out to be antipsychotic, they may possibly mitigate
against the extrapyramidal side effects of dopamine 0 2
antagonists by activating locomotion. nafadotride, for
example, a dopamine 0 3 receptor antagonist, activates
locomotion in rats (sautel et al. 1995).
furthermore, to test whether or not the occupation of
dopamine 0 4 receptors is related to catalepsy, it will be
helpful to have tritiated congeners of the new 0 4 -selective compounds (tallman 1994; kulagowski et al. 1996;
tenbrink et al. 1996) so that they may serve as radioligands for the dopamine 0 4 receptors.
however, because 0 4 -selective radioligands have not
hitherto been generally available, dopamine 0 4 receptors have been measured indirectly. one method, for
example, has been to use [3h]-nemonapride (formerly
ym-9151-2 or emonapride) to detect 0 2 , 0 3 , and 0 4 receptors and to use [3h]-raclopride or [1 25 i]epidepride to
label 0 2 and 0 3 sites. hence, the difference in densities
between the sites labeled by [3h]-nemonapride and
those labeled by [3h]-raclopride (or [1 251]-epidepride)
has been ascribed to drlike receptors or binding sites
(seeman et al. 1993, 1995; murray et al. 1995; sumiyoshi
et al. 1995; schoots et al. 1995; tarazi et al. 1995; lahti et
al. 1995, 1996a, 1996b). this procedure resulted in the
detection of elevated 0 4-like sites in postmortem
schizophrenia tissues (seeman et al. 1993, 1995; murray
et al. 1995; sumiyoshi et al. 1995). although reynolds
and mason (1995) did not detect elevated 0 4 -like sites
in schizophrenia tissues, they assumed that the specific
activity of [1 251]-epidepride fell with time; however, as
outlined elsewhere (seeman et al. 1995), the specific activity of [1251]-epidepride remains constant because the
molecule self-destructs upon decay. further discussion
of the 0 4 -like binding sites in schizophrenia is given by
kerwin and collier (1996).
however, recent preliminary findings, with drselective [3h]-ligands indicated little (lahti et al. 1996b) or
no detectable amounts of true 0 4 dopamine receptors in
either human control or schizophrenia striata (seeman
et al. 1995). this means that the existence of the elevated
0 4 -like sites in schizophrenia (seeman et al. 1993, 1995;
murray et al. 1995; sumiyoshi et al. 1995), although not
representing genuine 0 4 receptors, may actually represent altered features of 0 2 or drlike receptors. it is
known, for example, that the density of [3h]benzamide
sites exceeds the density of [3h]-spiperone sites in both
native tissues and in cloned dopamine 0 2 receptors
(niznik et al. 1985; seeman et al. 1992), giving rise to the
idea that dopamine 0 2 receptors may exist as either
monomers or dimers (seeman et al. 1992). recent work
on postmortem human tissues indicates that this is the
case (g. ng, s. george, p. seeman, b. o'dowd, in preparation). moreover, in schizophrenia, the proportion of
0 2 monomers and dimers may change so as to yield an
apparent elevation of 0 4 -like sites. an example of this

neuropsychopharmacology 1997-vol. 16, no. 2

latter phenomenon is seen for cholinergic muscarinic
receptors (wreggett and wells 1995). a change in the
association of g proteins with the muscarinic receptor
alters the relative densities of two muscarinic radioligands. this change is associated with an apparent increase in the difference between the two radioligand
densities and reflects a change in the oligomeric state of
the muscarinic receptors (wreggett and wells 1995). a
similar situation may occur in the dopamine 0 2 receptors in schizophrenia, because it is known that g regulation in the schizophrenia postmortem tissues is abnormal (seeman et al. 1989b, 1993).
if the dopamine 0 4 receptors do alleviate the cataleptic effects of neuroleptics, as suggested by the data in
figure 5, it will be important to determine the neuron
pathways or interactions between the dopamine 0 2 and
0 4 receptors. the low levels or absence of dopamine 0 4
receptors in the striatum are matched by the low levels
of 0 4 mrna in the human caudate nucleus and the
substantia nigra (van tol et al. 1991; matsumoto et al.
1995). hence, the existence of drcontaining cell bodies
in the striatum is ruled out. [tis possible, therefore, that
o 4 -containing neurons may extend from the cerebral
cortex down to o 2-containing neurones in the striatum
(seeman 1992a). much research remains to be done on the
cell-cell or intracellular nature of the  xxxg658xxx  interaction.

clozapine stimulation of 5-ht 1 a receptors
an effective alleviation of neuroleptic-induced catalepsy is produced by 8-oh-dpat (8-hydroxy-2-dipropylaminotetralin), a 5-ht 1a agonist (invernizzi et al.
1988; broekkamp et al. 1988; hicks 1990; wadenberg
and ahlenius 1991; wadenberg 1992; casey 1992; nealbeliveau 1993). in fact, it has recently been found that
clozapine does act as a partial agonist at the human
cloned 5-ht 1.11. receptor (newman-tancredi et al. 1996).
this may well be the basis for the anticataleptic or antiparkinsonian action of clozapine. however, much research remains to be done to confirm that this particular
mechanism is shared by other neuroleptics that elicit little parkinsonism.
in summary, the atypical neuroleptics appear to
have either a low affinity for dopamine 0 2 receptors, or
they appear to be moderately selective for dopamine 0 4
receptors.
