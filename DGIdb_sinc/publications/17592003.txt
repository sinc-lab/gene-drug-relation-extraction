 xxxd1747xxx : new treatment for hyponatremia
kimberly a. walter

a

rginine vasopressin (avp), also
known as  xxxd3495xxx 
(adh), is a peptide hormone
that regulates volume homeostasis in
the body by inﬂuencing the rate of
water excretion from the kidneys.
it is produced by the hypothalamoneurohypophysial system in response
to hypovolemia, hypotension, and
changes in osmolality.1 elevated levels of avp occur in various disease
states such as the syndrome of inappropriate adh secretion (siadh),
cirrhosis, adrenal insufﬁciency, and
chronic heart failure (hf) and may
result in vasoconstriction, fluid
retention, and euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia. because of
cerebral edema and the risk of seizures, hyponatremia, usually deﬁned
as a serum sodium concentration
of <135 meq/l (126–135 meq/l is
considered mild to moderate; <125
meq/l severe), may indicate a medical emergency.2,3 one study reported
that hyponatremia (serum sodium
concentration of <125 meq/l) occurred in nearly 5% of hospitalized
patients.4 mortality rates in criti-

purpose. the pharmacology, bioavailability and pharmacokinetics, clinical eﬃcacy,
adverse eﬀects and toxicities, drug interactions, dosage and administration, and
safety issues related to the use of  xxxd1747xxx  are discussed.
summary.  xxxd1747xxx  hydrochloride
is a nonpeptide, v1a and v2 vasopressinreceptor antagonist. it is available as an i.v.
formulation in 4-ml ampules containing 20
mg of  xxxd1747xxx  hydrochloride. the drug
is active both orally and i.v.  xxxd1747xxx 
injection is approved for the treatment of
euvolemic hyponatremia in hospitalized
patients. three double-blind, placebocontrolled, randomized, multicenter studies have been conducted in the united
states and internationally. the studies used
various dosing regimens for  xxxd1747xxx 
but maintained the same efficacy endpoints. each study showed  xxxd1747xxx  to
be eﬀective in increasing serum sodium
and in water clearance.  xxxd1747xxx  is being evaluated in the treatment of acute
decompensated heart failure and chronic
heart failure, but the safety of this drug

cally ill patients with symptomatic
hyponatremia have been reported to
be 60 times higher than in patients

has not been fully established. the drug
has been generally well tolerated in clinical
trials with both oral and i.v. administration.
the approved dosing regimen consists of a
20-mg i.v. loading dose administered over
30 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion of 20 mg administered over 24 hours.
clinical studies evaluating  xxxd1747xxx  have
been short term; longer-term eﬀects of hemodynamic parameters are unknown.
conclusion.  xxxd1747xxx , the ﬁrst vasopressin antagonist approved for the treatment
of euvolemic hyponatremia, has a unique
mechanism of action that results in freewater excretion and oﬀers a new option for
the treatment of resistant hyponatremia in
the acute setting when patients have not
responded to standard management.

formulary review

 xxxd1747xxx 

the formulary review section contains
monographs provided to ajhp by the clinical knowledge service, drug monograph
group, of the university healthsystem
consortium (uhc), oak brook, il. the
monographs are written by drug information specialists and pharmacotherapists
from uhc member institutions and vha
institutions, undergo peer review by uhc
and vha pharmacists and physicians, and
appear here some months after initial distribution. they have been edited by ajhp and
contain new abstracts. for more information,
see the initial installment in the december 1,
1997, issue or call karl a. matuszewski, m.s.,
pharm.d., or mary ellen bonk, pharm.d., at
uhc (630-954-1700).

limited and consist mainly of ﬂuid
restriction, diuresis, or hypertonic
solutions. signiﬁcant adverse effects
are associated with these therapies,
which are neither well tolerated nor
totally effective.5
a new class of vasopressin antagonists known as vaptans offers
an additional treatment option.6-10
the labeling of  xxxd1747xxx  injection,
the ﬁrst in this class, was approved
by the food and drug administration (fda) in december 2005 for
the management of euvolemic hyponatremia. this agent is also being
studied in phase iii trials for acute
decompensated and chronic hf.11
product description
 xxxd1747xxx  hydrochloride ( xxxd1747xxx , ym087, ci1025, astellas
pharma us, inc.) is a nonpeptide,
v1a and v2 vasopressin-receptor antagonist12 whose chemical name is [1,1′biphenyl]-2-carboxamide, n-[4[(4,5-dihydro-2-methylimidazo
[4,5-d][1]benzazepin-6(1h)-yl)
carbonyl]phenyl]-, monohydrochloride.13 it is available as an i.v. formulation in 4-ml ampules containing 20
mg of  xxxd1747xxx  hydrochloride.14
pharmacology
there are several types of vaso1386

 xxxd3000xxx  receptors, each having its
own physiological action (table
1).  xxxd1747xxx  is a dual v1a and v2
selective-receptor antagonist. it produces a unique aquaretic effect
through its action on the v2 receptors, resulting in increased excretion
of free water by increasing urine
output without increasing sodium
output. this effect may help normalize sodium levels in patients with hyponatremia. typical diuretics result
in natriuresis, which leads to the loss
of extracellular sodium.1
v1a antagonism by  xxxd1747xxx 
blocks the increase in blood pressure
response caused by exogenous vasopressin in a dose-dependent fashion.
the binding afﬁnity of  xxxd1747xxx 
for v1a receptors is one tenth that for
v2 receptors.1,7,15
bioavailability and
pharmacokinetics
the pharmacokinetic parameters
of  xxxd1747xxx  are shown in table
2.16-18 the drug is active both orally
and i.v.  xxxd1747xxx  has nonlinear
pharmacokinetics mostly because of
inhibition of its own metabolism.14
the pharmacodynamics of  xxxd1747xxx  were studied in an openlabel, crossover study in healthy
normotensive men. single doses of
oral (60 mg) or i.v. (50 mg)  xxxd1747xxx  produced a sevenfold increase
in urine ﬂow rate and a decrease
in urine osmolality from 600 to
<100 mosm/l. study results also

indicated that  xxxd1747xxx  produces
a 50% blockade of v1 receptors one
to two hours after an i.v. dose; this
effect was less pronounced after oral
administration.16
indications
 xxxd1747xxx  injection is approved
for the treatment of euvolemic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients.12
euvolemic hyponatremia occurs
when total body water increases with
little or no change in total body sodium; in most cases, the intravascular
volume is normal.4,5
phase iii trials with the i.v. formulation for the treatment of acute
hf and hypervolemic hyponatremia
have been completed, and studies
evaluating the oral formulation for
hyponatremia and for the management of chronic hf have also been
completed.1
clinical eﬃcacy
hyponatremia. two clinical trials evaluating  xxxd1747xxx  only in
patients with euvolemic hyponatremia have been conducted, but data
are available only in the prescribing
information.14 three double-blind,
placebo-controlled, randomized,
multicenter studies in patients with
either hypervolemic or euvolemic
hyponatremia have been conducted
in the united states and internationally. the results from these studies
are available as meeting abstracts
and a single published article. the

studies used various dosing regimens
for  xxxd1747xxx  but maintained the
same efﬁcacy endpoints, including
the change in sodium concentration
from baseline, the time to achieve a
≥4-meq/l increase in serum sodium
concentration, and the number
of patients achieving a ≥6-meq/l
increase in serum sodium concentration.1,14,19-22 each of these studies
showed  xxxd1747xxx  to be effective
in increasing serum sodium and
effective water clearance, a measure
of electrolyte–free water excretion.
these trials are summarized in
table 3.14,19-22
hf.  xxxd1747xxx  is being evaluated
in the treatment of acute decompensated heart failure (adhf) and
chronic hf, but the safety of this
drug for these indications has not
been fully established.18,23-25 elevated
avp levels in patients with hf lead
to poor outcomes caused by vasoconstriction and ﬂuid retention.26,27
the typical management of volume
overload in these patients consists
of diuretics, which are associated
with electrolyte imbalances that accompany increased urine output.
the use of i.v.  xxxd1747xxx  effectively
improves the hemodynamics in patients with acute hf.18 the clinical
studies that have evaluated the use
of  xxxd1747xxx  for hf and that have
been published or presented in abstract form are summarized in table
4.18,23  xxxd1747xxx  produced positive

results on hemodynamic parameters
and free-water excretion and reduced
the effects of furosemide on sodium
and potassium excretion.18,23
 xxxd1747xxx ’s safety and efﬁcacy
have also been evaluated in patients
with adhf in a completed but unpublished phase ii trial.25 a phase
iii trial assessing the efﬁcacy of oral
 xxxd1747xxx  on exercise tolerance in
patients with chronic hf is ongoing.
the a dose evaluation of a vasopressin antagonist in chf patients undergoing exercise study is comparing
escalating oral doses of 10, 20, and 40
mg of  xxxd1747xxx  twice a day with
placebo for 12 weeks. a total of 345
patients with new york heart association class ii to class iv hf will be
enrolled. the primary endpoint is the
change in exercise time to reach 70%
of peak oxygen consumption during
an incremental exercise test.1,24
adverse eﬀects and toxicities
 xxxd1747xxx  has been generally
well tolerated in clinical trials with
both oral and i.v. administration.
injection site reactions, the most
commonly reported adverse effects
with the i.v. formulation in clinical
trials, were reported in 52.5% of patients. most of these reactions were
mild, although some were severe
and required that the drug be discontinued. the incidence of adverse
effects reported in ≥3% of 72 healthy
volunteers and 111 patients who had

 xxxd1747xxx 

euvolemic hyponatremia and were
treated with a 20-mg loading dose
followed by 40 mg/day for two to
four days, compared with 40 healthy
volunteers and 21 patients who had
euvolemic hyponatremia and received placebo, are summarized in
table 5.14
drug interactions
 xxxd1747xxx  is a substrate and a
potent inhibitor of the cytochrome
p-450 (cyp)3a4 isoenzyme.14 coadministration of ketoconazole,
a potent cyp3a4 inhibitor, with
 xxxd1747xxx  resulted in a 4-fold increase in maximum plasma concentration (cmax) and an 11-fold increase
in the area under the curve (auc)
for oral  xxxd1747xxx . coadministration of substrates of cyp3a4 with
i.v.  xxxd1747xxx  resulted in 2- to 3-fold
increases in the auc for midazolam
1 mg i.v. or 2 mg orally, 3-fold increases for simvastatin, and 2-fold
increases for amlodipine. the clinical
signiﬁcance of these interactions is
not known, but dosing adjustments
may be warranted. administering
digoxin 0.5 mg with oral  xxxd1747xxx 
hydrochloride 40 mg twice daily
resulted in a 30% reduction in clearance and a 43% increase in the auc
for digoxin. therefore, additional
monitoring of digoxin levels may
be required. no interaction with
warfarin was found when twice-daily
oral  xxxd1747xxx  hydrochloride 40
mg was coadministered for 10 days.
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1747xxx 
were unchanged with the administration of captopril.14
a pilot study of 24 patients with
chronic hf was performed to assess
an interaction between furosemide
and  xxxd1747xxx . patients were randomized to furosemide 40 or 80
mg/day for six days followed by
concomitant oral  xxxd1747xxx  hydrochloride 20 or 40 mg daily for three
days. the pharmacokinetics were
not altered for either drug, although
 xxxd1747xxx  partially antagonized

consists of a 20-mg i.v. loading dose
administered over 30 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion of
20 mg administered over 24 hours.
a continuous infusion of  xxxd1747xxx 
hydrochloride 20 mg/day should be
administered for an additional one to
three days. the continuous infusion
may be adjusted to 40 mg daily if the
serum sodium is not increasing as
desired. however, the total duration
of the infusion should not exceed
four days. it is recommended that
 xxxd1747xxx  be infused via a large vein
and that the infusion site be changed
every 24 hours to decrease the risk of
vascular irritation.
a rapid rise in serum sodium
concentration (>12 meq/l per day)
may result in negative sequelae.
therefore, serum sodium, volume,
and neurologic status should be
monitored frequently during treatment.14 in addition, patients should
be monitored for infusion site reactions, including phlebitis, inﬂammation, and thrombosis.19
the i.v. formulation of  xxxd1747xxx  hydrochloride has been studied
in other dosing regimens in clinical
trials including 20 to 40 mg daily or
twice daily for three days, a 20-mg
bolus dose followed by a 40-mg/day
continuous infusion for four days,
and a 20-mg bolus dose followed by

safety issues
clinical studies evaluating  xxxd1747xxx  have been short term (four
days or less), and the drug’s longerterm effects on hemodynamic parameters are unknown.1
electrophysiology studies in
healthy volunteers indicated that 40or 80-mg i.v. doses of  xxxd1747xxx  hydrochloride had no effect on the q-t
interval and cardiac repolarization.14
 xxxd1747xxx  should not be administered to patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia or those
with hypersensitivity to any of its
components. coadministration
with potent cyp3a4 inhibitors such
as ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, and indinavir
is contraindicated.14
 xxxd1747xxx  has not been studied
in pediatric patients. adverse events
reported in elderly patients in trials were similar to those reported
in younger populations. caution
should be exercised in patients with
impaired hepatic and renal functions
because of decreased metabolism
and clearance of  xxxd1747xxx .14
 xxxd1747xxx  is classiﬁed in pregnancy category c. although fetal
tissue levels in rats were <10% of maternal concentrations, placental levels
were 2.2 times higher than maternal
concentrations. exposure of animals
to  xxxd1747xxx  has resulted in adverse
effects on the fetus. it is not known
whether  xxxd1747xxx  is excreted in
human breast milk.14
economic issues
hyponatremia can result from
several disease states including cirrhosis, siadh, and hf and can be
difﬁcult to manage. because of frequent hospitalizations and extended
lengths of stay, the economic burden
of these diseases is high. no pharmacoeconomic evaluations have been
conducted of the appropriate use of
 xxxd1747xxx  compared with current

 xxxd1747xxx 

therapies—namely, diuretics and ﬂuid restriction. likewise, there are no
usage guidelines suggesting the level
of hyponatremia at which therapy
should be considered.
the average wholesale price of
a 20-mg/4 ml vial of  xxxd1747xxx 
hydrochloride is $378.29 the cost of
the four-day infusion, including the
bolus dose, will range from $1890 to
$3024, depending on the dose. the
cost of therapy may be offset by a decrease in length of stay, but this outcome has not been studied to date.
similar agents under
consideration
several other vasopressin antagonists are in clinical development for
use in patients with hf and hyponatremia related to disease states,
including cirrhosis and siadh. 6
these agents are pure v2 antagonists
and are administered orally. two
of the drugs in phase iii trials are
sr121463 (a v2 antagonist by sanoﬁsynthelabo under investigation for
the treatment of hyponatremia)30
and  xxxd3399xxx  ( xxxd3399xxx ), which
is manufactured by otsuka and is
a once-daily, nonpeptide agent for
the treatment of hyponatremia and
hf.31-33 other agents in earlier stages
of development include vpa-985,
way-vpa-985, and vpa-343.6,34,35
recommendations and critical
issues
 xxxd1747xxx  is the ﬁrst vasopressin antagonist approved by fda
for the treatment of euvolemic
hyponatremia. it is a ﬁrst-in-class
vaptan with a unique mechanism
of action that results in free-water
excretion, increased urine output,
and decreased urine osmolality. this
agent will be a valuable addition to
the formulary for the treatment of
resistant hyponatremia in the acute
setting when patients have not responded to standard management.
although initial approval is limited
to euvolemic hyponatremia, the drug
is being evaluated for the treatment

conclusion
 xxxd1747xxx , the ﬁrst vasopressin
antagonist approved for the treatment of euvolemic hyponatremia,
has a unique mechanism of action
that results in free-water excretion
and offers a new option for the
treatment of resistant hyponatremia
in the acute setting when patients
have not responded to standard
management.
since the time of writing,  xxxd1747xxx  hydrochloride injection has
received fda-approved labeling for

1394

the treatment of hypervolemic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients.36
the labeling for  xxxd1747xxx  has been
updated to include clinical efﬁcacy
and safety data for patients with hypervolemic hyponatremia.
