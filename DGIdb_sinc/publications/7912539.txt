the aim of the present study was to evaluate the cardiac effects of the ,p3adrenoceptor agonist brl35135, and determine whether (3-receptors are
involved in mediating chronotropic or inotropic responses in man
eight normal males received single oral doses of brl35135 8 mg (brl) or the
selective p32-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol 8 mg (sal), after pretreatment with
either placebo (pl), bisoprolol 5 mg (b5) as a selective (3i-adrenoceptor antagonist, or  xxxd2689xxx  20 mg (n20) to block (i- and (2- but not ,33-receptors.
both brl and sal produced a significant increase in postural finger tremor in
keeping with (2-adrenoceptor stimulation, and this response was totally abolished
by pretreatment with n20.
significant increases in systolic blood pressure and doppler stroke distance
occurred with brl and sal which were unaffected by pretreatment with b5 and
completely blocked by n20, in keeping with (32-mediated effects.
brl and sal produced significant chronotropic and minute distance responses
which were unaffected by (31-adrenoceptor blockade. however, whereas n20
blocked these responses to sal, a small but significant response occurred with
brl in comparison with placebo despite complete blockade of co-existing
(32-mediated effects. compared with pl, the mean responses to n20/brl, and
the 95% confidence interval for the differences between the means were 7.4
beats min-' [3.2 to 11.6] (p = 0.002) for heart rate, and 208.8 cm [38.3 to 379.3]
(p = 0.02) for minute distance responses.
these results suggest that brl35135 produces most, if not all of its cardiac
effects by 032-adrenoceptor stimulation, although the possibility exists that a component of its chronotropic response is mediated by (33-receptors.

introduction
over recent years pharmacological effects of (adrenoceptor stimulation have been observed which
could not be explained in terms of the conventional
fi- and ,32-subtype classification, leading to the concept of a further sub-population of 'atypical' (p3) ,badrenoceptors [1-3]. genes encoding for both rat and
human p3-adrenoceptors have since been identified
and sequenced, and expression of these genes in
cloned cell lines has allowed the pharmacological
activity of this receptor subtype to be characterised
[4, 5].
in experimental animals, 03-adrenoceptors have
been identified on adipocytes [6], skeletal muscle [7]

and on smooth muscle cells throughout the gastrointestinal tract [8-101. an analysis of previous studies using ,b-adrenoceptor partial agonists has also
suggested the presence of cardiac ,83-receptors [11].
however, little is known of the distribution and function of (3-adrenoceptors in man. in vitro studies have
demonstrated their presence on human adipocytes
[12, 13] and neuroblastoma cell lines [14], and there
is in vivo data with  xxxd2398xxx  to suggest that 03receptors play a role in mediating thermogenic
responses [15] and may also be present in the human
heart [16].
the aim of the present study was to clarify further

whether 033-adrenoceptors may mediate chronotropic
or inotropic responses in man, using the j3-adrenoceptor agonist brl35 135 (smithkline beecham
pharmaceuticals).  xxxd2689xxx  20 mg was used to antagonise ,i- and f2-, but not p3-adrenoceptors, on the
basis of previous in vitro and in vivo data obtained
using this drug [4, 15]. bisoprolol 5 mg was used to
block selectively any potential pli-mediated effects
[17]. a parallel study was performed using salbutamol, in order to compare the effects of a known p2selective agonist.

methods

suprasternal notch to record ascending aortic blood
velocity. the mean systolic velocity-time integral
(stroke distance) was calculated from three consistent
spectral doppler waveforms. minute distance (md)
was calculated as the product of stroke distance and
heart rate. since the cross-sectional area of the
ascending aorta is constant, sd (cm) and md (cm)
are the respective linear analogues of stroke volume
and cardiac output (18). postural finger tremor was
measured in the supine position by a previously validated method, with an accelerometer transducer
(entran ltd, ealing, uk) and computer-assisted spectral analysis using autoco-variance (19). the mean
total tremor power >2hz was obtained from five consistent recordings and used for analysis.

subjects

statistical analysis

eight normal male volunteers were studied with a
mean age (s.e. mean) of 23 ± 2 years. all subjects
had a normal physical examination, full blood count,
biochemical profile, urinalysis and 12-lead electrocardiogram prior to entry into the study, and none was
taking concurrent medication. subjects with a history
of asthma, hypertension, diabetes, thyroid disease and
cardiac arrhythmias were excluded. the study was
approved by the tayside medical ethics committee
and written informed consent was provided by all
volunteers.

all data were analysed using a 'statgraphics' software package (stsc software publishing group,
bethseda, usa). the effects of treatments on the
time profiles of each variable were compared using
repeated measures multifactorial analysis of variance
(manova). duncan's multiple range testing with
confidence limits set at 95% was used to identify time
points where differences between treatments were
significant. all results are calculated as changes from
baseline and are expressed in the text as means and
95% confidence intervals. since brl35135 and
salbutamol have differing pharmacokinetic properties,
the results given are calculated at the time point of
peak response to the drug (t, min) as stated in the text
for each variable. a probability value of p < 0.05
was considered as being of significance for all statistical tests, and hence for clarity individual p values
are not given where a result is stated in the text to be

protocol

subjects attended the laboratory at the same time of
day on each of 7 study days separated by weekly
intervals. all had fasted from the previous night and
physical exercise, nicotine and caffeine consumption
were prohibited on study days. treatments were
administered in a single-blind, crossover design and
2 h prior to attendance subjects ingested pretreatment
with either placebo (pl), bisoprolol 5 mg (b5) or
 xxxd2689xxx  20 mg (n20). subjects then rested supine for
a 30 min run-in period prior to baseline measurements of heart rate (hr), systolic (sbp) and diastolic
(dbp) blood pressure, doppler stroke distance (sd)
and postural finger tremor (tr). volunteers then
received single oral doses of either placebo (pl),
brl35135 8 mg (brl) or salbutamol 8 mg (sal),
and the above measurements were repeated at 30 min
intervals for the following 2 h.
measurements
heart rate was continuously monitored throughout the
study period and the mean heart rate at each time
point calculated from five consecutive r-r intervals.
measurements of arterial blood pressure were made
using a dinamap semi-automatic sphygmomanometer
(critikon, florida, usa), with the mean of three successive consistent recordings being used for analysis.
stroke distance was measured using a hewlettpackard 77020a cardiac ultrasound system (massachusetts, usa), with a 1.9 mhz non-imaging,
continuous wave doppler transducer positioned in the

significant.

discussion
the results of the present study show that both
the 03-adrenoceptor agonist brl35135 and the p2selective agonist salbutamol produce significant
chronotropic and inotropic effects in man, although
it is important to consider more carefully which
,-adrenoceptor subtypes are responsible for mediating these responses. in order to clarify the involvement of j32-receptors in this situation, we also studied
effects on postural finger tremor, which are known to
be f2-mediated [20], and compared the responses to
brl 35135 with those of the selective j2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol. brl and sal both produced
a significant increase in postural finger tremor compared with pl, in keeping with p2-adrenoceptor stimulation. the p1-selective antagonist bisoprolol produced
no significant attenutaion of this response, and hence
demonstrated no co-existing ,-2-adrenoceptor antagonism at the dose used in this study. n20 completely
blocked the tr responses to both brl and sal as a
consequence of its d2-adrenoceptor blockade.
with respect to the chronotropic effects, we found
that both brl and sal produced significant

increases in hr compared with pl, and this response
was unaffected by selective
3i-adrenoceptor antagonism with bisoprolol. however, whereas pretreatment
with n20 produced complete blunting of the
chronotropic response to sal, this was not the case
with brl which still produced a small but significant
increase in hr. let us therefore consider how this
may have occurred in terms of the p-adrenoceptor
subtypes responsible for mediating this response.
it is known from radioligand binding studies that
the human myocardium contains a mixed population
of both f3i- and p2-adrenoceptors [21, 22], and both
subtypes may mediate chronotropic responses in vivo
[23-25]. reflex vagal withdrawal due to p2-mediated
peripheral vasodilatation may also contribute to the
chronotropic effect of a 02-adrenoceptor agonist [26].
with regard to the present study, there are two
possible explanations to account for the residual
chronotropic response which occurred with brl (but
not sal) after pretreatment with n20. firstly, it is
possible that this response is being mediated by p2adrenoceptors which have not been totally blocked by
n20. however, n20 completely abolished the tr,
sbp and sd responses to both brl and sal, all of
which appear to be mediated by p2-receptors. it is
conceivable that the affinity of brl for chronotropic
p 2-adrenoceptors may be greater than that of sal,
and that this has to a small degree overcome the

figure 5 effects of a) brl and b) sal
distance (as in figure 1).

minute

antagonism of these receptors by n20. however,
there is no evidence either from this or previous studies [17, 20] to suggest inherent differences in p2adrenoceptor sensitivity between chronotropic,
inotropic and tremor responses. an alternative explanation might be the presence of cardiac p3-adrenoceptors which are functionally coupled to mediating
chronotropic responses, and this will be discussed
further below.
both brl and sal produced significant increases
in sbp compared with pl, and whereas pretreatment
with b5 had no significant effect, n20 completely
blunted these responses. the sbp responses to both
drugs therefore appeared to be p2-mediated, and this
would be in keeping with previous in vivo studies
which have demonstrated the presence of functional
inotropic p2-adrenoceptors [17, 27, 28]. since the
changes in sbp mirrored those of tr and could be
totally accounted for by p2-adrenoceptor stimulation,
there is no evidence to suggest that ,3-receptors are
involved in mediating this response to brl or sal.
in order to evaluate the effects of treatments on
stroke volume and cardiac output, continuous wave
doppler ultrasound was employed to measure ascending aortic blood flow and determine the left ventricular systolic velocity integral (stroke distance). this
simple, non-invasive technique is both accurate and
reproducible [29-31], and since the diameter of the

368

n. m. wheeldon, d. g. mcdevitt & b. j. lipworth

aortic valve is constant, stroke distance and minute
distance are linear indices of stroke volume and cardiac output respectively [18]. a significant increase
in sd occurred with both brl and sal which
appeared to be p2-mediated, in that b5 had no effect
whereas the response was completely blocked by
n20. although this effect may have occurred as a
result of the p2-mediated inotropic action of brl and
sal, the issue may be complicated by changes in left
ventricular filling as a consequence of concurrent
chronotropic or lusitropic effects. as with sbp, there
is no evidence of a ,83-mediated mechanism to
account for the sd response to either brl or sal.
minute distance was calculated to reflect changes
in cardiac output, being derived from indices of both
heart rate and stroke volume. md was increased
significantly by both brl and sal, and since pretreatment with b5 had no effect this implied that f1adrenoceptors were not involved in this response. in
the case of sal, n20 completely blocked the md
response, although this did not occur with brl in
comparison with pl. studying each component of the
md response separately, it is clear that the residual
response obtained with brl after pretreatment with
n20 is accounted for by chronotropic effects, rather
than by changes in stroke distance.
these data may therefore suggest the possibility of
a ,83-mediated chronotropic response to brl in vivo,
although to date the question of whether cardiac 03adrenoceptors are present in man has not been
addressed by in vitro studies. using radioligand binding studies the distribution of cardiac p1- and 02adrenoceptors has been extensively studied [32],
although it does not appear that selective p3-adreno-

ceptor agonist and antagonist agents have been used
to specifically address this question. the issue is
complicated by the fact that several of the so-called
'selective' v- and 02-adrenoceptor antagonists (e.g.
cgp 20712a and ici 118,551 respectively) used in
radioligand binding studies, have since been shown to
block p3-receptors [4]. kaumann has postulated the
presence of chronotropic 33-adrenoceptors after
reviewing previous studies which showed stimulating
effects in isolated animal heart using high concentrations of the p-adrenoceptor partial agonists  xxxd2957xxx ,
cgp 12177 and  xxxd123xxx  [11]. these responses
were unaffected by saturating concentrations of land 02-adrenoceptor antagonists, and it is very interesting to note that all these agents have subsequently
been shown to produce stimulatory effects on both
cloned human and rat p3-adrenoceptors [4, 5]. brodde
has also recently concluded in a review of cardiac ,adrenoceptors, that the existence of p3-receptors
mediating chronotropic effects could not be ruled out
[32].
in summary, the results of the present study suggest that brl35135 produces most if not all of its
cardiac effects by jb2-adrenoceptor stimulation. however, we have also found a small but significant
chronotropic effect to brl35135 which is not pimediated, and which occurs despite complete blockade of co-esisting 02-mediated effects. whether this
represents a p3-mediated effect remains unproven and
further studies are indicated to answer this question.
