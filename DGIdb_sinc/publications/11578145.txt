selenium (se) is an essential element with a narrow range of
intake for physiological functions, and cases in which it has
caused either poisoning or deficiency disease are known. because animals have no efficient mechanism for selenoamino
acids synthesis, they receive them through foods. one of the
selenoamino acids,  xxxd3187xxx  (semet), was identified
in some plant proteins (yasumoto et al., 1988). se-enriched
yeast has been introduced as a food source of semet because
an experimental study has shown that semet is an appropriate
supplemental form of essential se for humans (schrauzer,
1998). se intoxication caused by an excess intake of seenriched foods has been reported (jensen, 1984). therefore, it
is important to elucidate its toxicity and metabolic pathway of
semet in mammals.
there are reports on acute and chronic toxicity of semet.
klug et al. (1949) reported that the median lethal dose (ld 50)
in rats receiving an intraperitoneal injection of semet was 4.25
mg se/kg. the ld 50 value in mice after the intravenous injection was 8.8 ⫾ 1.37 mg se/kg, and the minimum lethal dose
was 4.0 mg se/kg (ammar and couri, 1981). the chronic
toxicity of semet was lower than that of selenite (spallholz and
rafferty, 1987). oral toxicity data of semet are considered to
be of importance because it is a major chemical form of se in
natural foods for humans; however, little is known about its
ld 50 value for a single oral dose.
the biological activity of se as a nutrient, toxicant, or
anticarcinogen in animals is dependent on the chemical form
arising from its metabolism. both the inorganic and organic se
compounds have been proposed to be finally metabolized to
(ch 3) 3se ⫹ via h 2se as an intermediate (nakamuro et al.,
1997). if semet metabolizes through the same pathway as
methionine (met) (kajander et al., 1991), it may be converted
to selenocysteine (secyh) via selenohomocysteine and selenocystationine. secyh may be decomposed further to h 2se by
selenocysteine ␤-lyase in the liver (esaki et al., 1981, 1982;
hasegawa et al., 1996), and h 2se may be used for either
selenoprotein synthesis or sequential methylation to ch 3seh,

the objective of this study was to clarify the detoxification
pathways of  xxxd3187xxx  (semet) in mouse liver. it has been
postulated that semet may be metabolized to selenocysteine (secyh) via a pathway similar to methionine (met). cyseh may be
decomposed to h 2se, which is consequently methylated to
ch 3seh, (ch 3) 2se, and (ch 3) 3se ⴙ. in this study, we estimated
that the median lethal single oral dose (ld 50) was 67.0 mg/kg. we
also found that (ch 3) 3se ⴙ was quickly produced in mouse liver
after single oral administration of semet. this result suggested the
existence of a quick ␣,␥-elimination pathway. we measured the
amounts of ␣-ketobutyrate, nh 3, and ch 3seh produced by enzymic ␣,␥-elimination reaction of semet in the liver of periodateoxidized adenosine (pad) or d, xxxd1485xxx  (ppg)-treated
mice in order to verify the existence of ␣,␥-elimination enzyme.
pad is an inhibitor of s- xxxg104xxx  ( xxxg104xxx ),
which is necessary for conversion of semet to secyh. ppg is an
effective inhibitor of the pyridoxal 5ⴕ-phosphate (plp)-containing
enzyme bacterial  xxxd2595xxx  ␥-lyase ( xxxg543xxx .11) contributing
to the ␣,␥-elimination reaction of semet and cystathionine ␥-lyase
( xxxg543xxx ) relating to conversion of semet to secyh. when
semet was incubated with the s9 fraction from liver of padtreated mice, the formation of ␣-ketobutyrate was much the same
as that from nontreated mouse liver. however, the amount of
␣-ketobutyrate formed significantly decreased in the reaction of
semet with s9 fraction from the liver of ppg-treated mice. in an
in vivo experiment using mice treated with pad before a toxic
dosage of semet, the amount of semet in the liver decreased and
the amount of acid-volatile se derived fromch 3seh increased
gradually. this phenomenon was not observed in the ppg-pretreated group. furthermore, the protein fraction that had the
␣,␥-elimination enzyme activity was found in mouse liver cytosol
by gel chromatographic technique. the results of this study indicated that semet was directly metabolized to ch 3seh by an
␣,␥-elimination enzyme analogous to bacterial  xxxd2595xxx 
␥-lyase, in addition to the generally acceptable pathway via
secyh. © 2001 academic press

(ch 3) 2se, and (ch 3) 3se ⫹ by  xxxd3156xxx -dependent
methyltransferase (ganther, 1986). the rapid metabolism of
semet in rat was found from distributing behaviors of se
metabolites in serum after the oral administration, in comparison with na 2seo 3 (patterson et al., 1989). the amount of
(ch 3) 3se ⫹ in urine from rats treated with semet increased
earlier than that in rats given selenocystine (secys) or
na 2seo 3 (nakamuro et al., 1997), despite there being many
metabolic steps from semet to (ch 3) 3se ⫹ via secyh. in a
preliminary experiment, we also found that (ch 3) 3se ⫹ was
rapidly produced in mouse liver after oral administration of
semet as well as na 2seo 3.
tanaka et al. (1977) purified  xxxd2595xxx  ␥-lyase (ec
4.4.1.11) from pseudomonas putida (ifo 3738). they indicated that the bacterial enzyme was a pyridoxisal 5⬘-phosphate
(plp) enzyme that catalyzes ␣,␥-elimination reaction of met
and its derivatives such as semet. however, existence of such
an enzyme has not been confirmed in mammalian liver.
if semet is directly metabolized to form ch 3seh through
the proposed pathway shown in fig. 1, (ch 3) 3se ⫹ must be
produced quickly in the liver. existence of ␣,␥-elimination
enzyme in the liver that decomposes semet into ␣-ketobutyrate, nh 3, and ch 3seh is indispensable to the rapid metabolism. in order to clarify the detoxification pathway of a toxic
dosage of semet, this present study was carried out to estimate
the ld 50 value of semet for a single oral dose. we also
attempted to verify the hypothesis that there might be an
enzyme in mouse liver that would catalyze the ␣,␥-elimination
reaction of semet.

materials and methods
chemicals. seleno- xxxd2595xxx  (semet, 98%), periodate-oxidized adenosine (pad), d, xxxd1485xxx  (ppg), ␣-ketobutyrate, and 3-methyl-2benzothiazolone hydrazone (mbth) were obtained from sigma (st. louis,
mo). sodium selenite (na 2seo 3, 99.999%) was purchased from aldrich
chemical co., inc. (milwaukee, wi). all other chemicals used were analytical
reagent grade.
animals. male icr mice (4 weeks old) were obtained from japan slc
co., ltd. (shizuoka, japan) and housed in polycarbonate cages containing soft
wood-chip bedding with free access to diet (nmf, oriental yeast co., ltd,
tokyo, japan) and tap water. animals were housed in a room maintained at
23 ⫾ 1°c, 47– 67% relative humidity, and a 12-h light/dark cycle and were
kept under these environmental conditions for 1 week prior to use. they were
randomly assigned to either a control or a treatment group.
acute study. to estimate ld 50 value, mice were randomly divided into
groups of 10. semet was dissolved in 0.9% nacl and administered orally via
a stomach tube. the mice received 23.1, 27.8, 33.3, 40.0, 48.0, 57.6, 69.1, 82.9,
or 99.5 mg/kg in a single oral dose. the control group was treated with 0.9%
nacl alone. cumulative mortality after 10 days was used in determination of
ld 50 value according to the method of litchfield and wilcoxon (1949).
metabolic study. each mouse was injected 0.1 mmol/kg ip pad (hoffman, 1980; hoffman and mcconnell, 1987) 30 min before oral treatment of 45
mg/kg semet or 1.5 mmol/kg ppg (abeles and walsh, 1973) 24 h before the
administration of semet. animals were euthanized at 0, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min
after administration of semet. the mice used as the reference group were
treated with 45 mg/kg semet alone.
se determination. se content was determined by the fluorometric method
using 2,3-diaminonaphthalene (watkinson, 1966) after wet digestion of the
samples with mixed acid solution ( xxxd2738xxx  3/hclo 4, 2:1).
semet and (ch 3) 3se ⴙ determination. semet and (ch 3) 3se ⫹ contents in
the liver were measured by a modification of the method of oyamada and
ishizaki (1986). separation of semet and (ch 3) 3se ⫹ was carried out by
cation-exchange column chromatography. the 20,000g supernatant (0.5 ml)

20

okuno et al.

of 10% homogenate in 0.4 m hclo 4 was adjusted to ph 1.2–1.4 with 6 n hcl
and then applied to a toyopac ic-sp m column (h ⫹ form, 1 ml gel
volume; tosoh co., tokyo, japan). the column was stepwise eluted with 3 ml
each of h 2o, 1 n nh 3, h 2o, 0.05 n hcl, and finally 4 n hcl. semet and
(ch 3) 3se ⫹ were eluted with 1 n nh 3 and 4 n hcl, respectively. se contents
in these fractions were measured by the method described above to calculate
semet and (ch 3) 3se ⫹ contents.
acid-volatile se determination. acid-volatile se content in the liver s9
fraction was measured by a modification of the technique of diplock et al.
(1973). initially, total se was measured with an aliquot of the s9 fraction.
the fraction was placed in a bubbler and was flushed with nitrogen gas for
10 min before being acidified with 12 n hcl to a concentration of 4 n.
sample was then bubbled by nitrogen gas for 15 min and se content was
measured as nonvolatile se. the disappearance of se from the sample
acidified indicates acid-volatile se defined as (acid-volatile se) ⫽ (total
se) ⫺ (nonvolatile se).

␣-ketobutyrate and nh 3 formation from semet by the enzymatic ␣,␥elimination. mice were euthanized 30 min after administration of 0.1
mmol/kg pad or 24 h after administration of 1.5 mmol/kg ppg. liver of mice
pretreated with pad or ppg was homogenized with 5 vol of 10 mm potassium
phosphate buffer (ph 7.4), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 9000g for
20 min at 4°c. ␣-ketobutyrate produced by the ␣,␥-elimination of semet was
measured by a method using mbth (soda, 1967, 1968; nakayama et al.,
1984). the assay mixture contained 10 mm l-semet, 0.01 mm plp, 20 mm
potassium phosphate buffer (ph 8.0), and pad- or ppg-pretreated liver s9
fraction in a final volume of 1 ml. the mixture was incubated at 37°c for 10
min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of protein precipitant:
trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10% or ammonia-test wako
(wako pure chemical industries, ltd., osaka, japan) to a final concentration
of 20%. after centrifugation at 20,000g for 20 min, the ␣-ketobutyrate formed
in the supernatant solution was determined by mbth. the reaction mixture
consisted of 0.5 ml of supernatant solution, 1 ml of 1 m acetate buffer (ph
5.0), and 0.4 ml of 0.1% mbth. incubation was carried out at 50°c for 30
min. the reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature and observed
at 320 nm with a spectrophotometer. nh 3 production was measured by the
method using the indophenol blue reaction (horn and squire, 1966). protein
was determined by the method of bradford (1976) with bovine plasma ␥-globulin as the standard.
gel filtration chromatography. mouse liver was homogenized with 10 vol
of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.2) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05 mm n-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone,
1 mm edta, 0.01%  xxxd26xxx , and 2% ethanol. the homogenate
was ultracentrifuged at 105,000g, for 1 h at 4°c. the supernatant obtained
from the hepatic homogenate was applied to a column of sephadex g-150
(26.5 mm id ⫻ 600 mm), which was equilibrated with the above buffer. a
5-ml aliquot of the sample was eluted at a flow rate of about 1 ml/min with

were assayed by the method described above.

results

median lethal dose of semet for single oral dose
this experiment was carried out to determine the toxic
dosage of semet for mouse. for 10 days after the single oral
dosage, as shown in fig. 2, the mean body weight gain of mice
administered semet decreased with increasing doses. one
mouse given 48.0 mg/kg died within 1 day after administration.
from the cumulative mortality after 10 days, the ld 50 value
was determined according to the method of litchfield and
wilcoxon (1949), being 67.0 mg/kg with a confidence limit of
59.8 –75.0 mg/kg. from these results, mice received 45 mg/kg
semet orally in order to investigate the detoxification pathway
of semet.
enzymatic metabolism of semet to ch 3seh
if semet is metabolized in the two proposed metabolic
pathways shown in fig. 1, ␣-ketobutyrate must be generated
from both metabolism processes. as shown in fig. 3, the
amount of ␣-ketobutyrate produced was 0.35 ⫾ 0.02 nmol/
min/mg protein when semet was incubated with s9 fraction of
the liver from nontreated mice. when only the metabolic
pathway via secyh was inhibited by the pretreatment of pad,
the amount of ␣-ketobutyrate formed was 0.39 ⫾ 0.02 nmol/
min/mg protein, indicating no statistical difference from the
control group. on the other hand, with the s9 fraction from the
liver of ppg-pretreated mice in which both pathways were
inhibited, ␣-ketobutyrate formation was markedly depressed.
these results indicate a possibility that semet is converted by
enzymic ␣,␥-elimination reaction.
in vivo experiments were then performed to clarify whether
there is a direct pathway of the metabolism from semet to
ch 3seh in animals. as shown in fig. 4a, the amount of

␣,␥-elimination metabolism of  xxxd3187xxx 

21

the result that an equivalence of ␣-ketobutyrate and nh 3 is
formed from semet is similar to the case of ␣,␥-elimination
reaction of semet by the bacterial  xxxd2595xxx  ␥-lyase.
the peak ii fraction showed an absorbance spectrum typical
of other plp-containing enzymes, with a characteristic absorption maximum at 420 nm due to the linkage between the formyl
group of plp and an amino group of the enzyme (data not
shown). unless plp was added in the reaction mixture containing the peak ii fraction and semet, the generation of
␣-ketobutyrate or nh 3 was decreased to approximately 60% of
the value in the reaction mixture with plp. these results
indicate that plp is required for the enzymic ␣,␥-elimination
reaction of semet.
these data suggest that the peak ii fraction contains a plp
enzyme that catalyzes the ␣,␥-elimination reaction of semet.
discussion
fig. 4. effect of pad- or ppg-pretreatment on semet/total se rate (a)
and acid-volatile se production (b) in liver from mice after administration of
semet (45 mg/kg po). pad (0.1 mmol/kg ip) was injected 30 min before, and
ppg (1.5 mmol/kg ip) was injected 24 h before semet administration. control
(f), pad-pretreated (f), and ppg-pretreated (œ) are shown for five animals
(mean ⫾ sd).

semet/total se, the index showing the metabolism of semet
into other se metabolites, rapidly increased 20 min after administration of semet in liver from pad- or ppg-pretreated
mice. in the pad-pretreated group, the amount of semet/total
se gradually reduced to the control level. in contrast, the
amount of acid-volatile se derived from ch 3seh in liver from
pad-pretreated mice increased 10 min after administration of
semet and showed a value of 4 ␮g se/g liver as shown in fig.
4b. such behaviors of se-metabolites containing semet in the
pad-pretreated mouse liver result from the metabolism of
semet to ch 3seh by the ␣,␥-elimination enzyme. no formation of acid-volatile se was recognized in ppg-pretreated
group because the metabolism of semet was restricted. this
result also supports the existence of the ␣,␥-elimination enzyme.

a number of studies have revealed differences in the biological or toxic effect of various se compounds (ipcs, 1987).
se effects are, in most cases, caused by metabolites produced
from the parent compound. knowledge of the metabolic pathway of semet is considered to be of importance because this se
form accounts for the predominance of se occurring naturally
in foods (yasumoto et al., 1988; schrauzer, 1998). in order to
clarify the detoxification pathway of semet, this present acute
oral toxicity study of semet demonstrated that the ld 50 value
was 67.0 mg/kg (27.0 mg se/kg) and the minimum lethal dose
was 48.0 mg/kg (19.3 mg se/kg). the oral acute toxicity of

separation of the enzyme catalyzed the ␣,␥-elimination
reaction of semet
to elucidate the existence of the enzyme that catalyzed the
␣,␥-elimination reaction of semet in mouse liver, hepatic
cytosol (5 ml) was separated using a sephadex g-150 gel
filtration column. four protein peaks were observed at fraction
numbers 36, 54, 76, and 112 as shown in fig. 5. ␣-ketobutyrate production was recognized only from the reaction of
semet and the eluate of a peak ii fraction (near fraction 54).
when the eluate of fraction 54 was reacted with semet, the
amounts of ␣-ketobutyrate and nh 3 generation were 0.368 ⫾
0.001 and 0.395 ⫾ 0.072 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively.

okuno et al.

semet was a little higher than that of secys reported by sayato
et al. (1993). this difference in toxicity may be based on the
generation rate and chemical form of metabolites.
semet has been previously assumed to be metabolized as
follows: it is converted to secyh via selenohomocysteine and
selenocystathionine in analogy to the methionine pathway
without semet-specific enzymes (esaki et al., 1981; kajander
et al., 1991). the secyh formed may be degraded further in
the liver to h 2se by the enzyme selenocysteine ␤-lyase (esaki
et al., 1981, 1982; hasegawa et al., 1996). h 2se also may be
used for selenoprotein synthesis such as glutathione peroxidase
(mizutani et al., 1991, 1992) and methylation to ch 3seh,
(ch 3) 2se, and (ch 3) 3se ⫹ (ganther, 1986). methylated se metabolites are generally considered to be less toxic than the
parent compound (olson, 1986), and the methylation process
may be a detoxification mechanism. because the production of
the methylated metabolite (ch 3) 3se ⫹ was found in the liver
after administration of semet immediately, we hypothesized
that semet might be catabolized directly to ch 3seh by the
␣,␥-elimination enzyme targeted in this study (fig. 1). in this
study, to confirm the presumed pathway, we investigated the
behaviors of metabolites under conditions that inhibited metabolism from semet to secyh by pad in vitro and in vivo
experiments. the facts that ␣-ketobutyrate, nh 3, and acidvolatile se derived from ch 3seh are generated by the ␣,␥elimination reaction of semet, although the metabolic pathway
via secyh is inhibited by pad-treatment, suggest the existence of ␣,␥-elimination enzyme activity in mouse liver (figs.
3 and 4). moreover, because the metabolic inhibition caused by
ppg treatment restricts the conversion of semet to those
metabolites, it is believed that the ␣,␥-elimination enzyme
contributes to the metabolism of semet (figs. 3 the 4). although acid-volatile se content increased depending on the
decrease in semet content in the liver of pad-pretreated mice
following oral administration of semet (fig. 4), no formation
of (ch 3) 2se as volatile se and (ch 3) 3se ⫹ in the liver was
observed (data not shown). pad is an extremely effective
inhibitor in vivo of s- xxxg104xxx  (the s- xxxd3157xxx -degrading enzyme) (hoffman, 1980), which is
necessary for transfer of semet to secyh. on the other hand,
it has been reported that intracellular s- xxxd3157xxx 
increased by pad inhibits  xxxd3156xxx -dependent
methyltransferase related to (ch 3) 2se and (ch 3) 3se ⫹ synthesis
(hoffman and mcconnell, 1987). as a result of s- xxxg104xxx  inhibition by pad-treatment, the methylated
metabolites, volatile se and (ch 3) 3se ⫹, in the liver of padpretreated mice following administration of semet were not
observed. in the same experiments with ppg-pretreated mice,
such metabolites were hardly detected because the metabolism
of semet was restricted.
it has been reported that  xxxd2595xxx  ␥-lyase from pseudomonas putida (ifo 3738) has a molecular weight of about
170,000 (tanaka et al., 1977). this is a plp enzyme that
catalyzes substrates such as met and semet (tanaka et al.,

1977; esaki et al., 1979). semet is known as a better substrate
than met in the bacterial ␣,␥-elimination enzyme (esaki et al.,
1979). the bacterial enzyme catalyzes ␣,␥-elimination of semet to yield ␣-ketobutyrate, ch 3seh, and nh 3. in this study,
it was recognized that one of four main protein fractions
obtained by gel-filtration chromatography of mouse liver cytosol has an ␣,␥-elimination activity that decomposes semet as
substrate (fig. 5). the enzyme showed a catalytic reaction
similar to  xxxd2595xxx  ␥-lyase derived from bacteria: an
equivalence of ␣-ketobutyrate and nh 3 was generated by the
␣,␥-elimination of semet. it was also shown that this reaction
requires plp as a cofactor.
we presume that semet may be converted into ch 3seh by
both metabolic pathways as shown in fig. 1. these pathways
may have different roles depending on the concentration of
semet in the liver. the production of h 2se, which is the
precursor for incorporation into selenoproteins like glutathione
peroxidase (mizutani et al., 1991, 1992), is believed to be
required to achieve physiological function as se. the metabolic pathway via secyh may be mainly concerned with h 2se
generation at the nutritional level. on the other hand, we
speculate that a role of the ␣,␥-elimination pathway is the
quick detoxification to (ch 3) 3se ⫹. itoh and suzuki (1997)
assumed that the methylation process from ch 3seh to
(ch 3) 3se ⫹ might be induced or activated when the dose of se
exceeded the capacity of ch 3seh. when semet is administered to a toxic level, there is a possibility that the rapid
metabolism to ch 3seh by the ␣,␥-elimination enzyme takes
precedence for semet detoxification.
in summary, this study found that a new ␣,␥-elimination
enzyme activity analogous to the bacterial  xxxd2595xxx 
␥-lyase that participated in the detoxification metabolism of
semet at the toxic level existed in the mouse. further study is
required to purify this ␣,␥-elimination enzyme to clarify
whether its physicochemical and enzymological properties are
the same as those of a bacterial enzyme.
