the low-afﬁnity sodium glucose cotransporter ( xxxg2141xxx ) is responsible for most of the glucose reabsorption in
the kidney and has been highlighted as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes. we discovered
sergliﬂozin etabonate, a novel selective  xxxg2141xxx  inhibitor, and found that selective inhibition of  xxxg2141xxx  increased
urinary glucose excretion and consequently decreased plasma glucose levels. in this report, we examined the
antihyperglycemic effects of sergliﬂozin etabonate in normal and diabetic rats in comparison with those of a
sulfonylurea ( xxxd2202xxx ) and an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor ( xxxd3524xxx ). sergliﬂozin etabonate increased urinary
glucose excretion in a dose-dependent manner, and inhibited the increase in plasma glucose after sucrose
loading independently of insulin secretion in normal rats. sergliﬂozin etabonate also improved postprandial
hyperglycemia in neonatal  xxxd3249xxx -induced diabetic rats; whereas  xxxd2202xxx  did not improve it. in rats
with mild or moderate  xxxd3249xxx -induced diabetes, the degree of the antihyperglycemic effects of
sergliﬂozin etabonate correlated with the severity of the diabetic condition. sergliﬂozin etabonate did not
affect the plasma glucose level of normal rats as seen with  xxxd2202xxx . chronic treatment with sergliﬂozin
etabonate reduced the levels of glycated hemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose, and improved the glycemic
response after glucose loading in zucker fatty rats. in addition, sergliﬂozin etabonate did not affect the body
weight or food intake. these data indicate that sergliﬂozin etabonate could improve glycemic control without
its use resulting in insulin secretion, hypoglycemia, and body weight gain, and may provide a unique approach
to the treatment of diabetes.

1. introduction
the low-afﬁnity sodium glucose cotransporter ( xxxg2141xxx ) (wells
et al., 1992; kanai et al., 1994), which is expressed speciﬁcally in the
kidney tubules, plays a major role in renal glucose reabsorption, with
high-afﬁnity sodium glucose cotransporter ( xxxg2140xxx ) (pajor and wright,
1992; wright, 2001), having a supporting role. to date, several drug
companies are evaluating  xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors as a potential new class of
antidiabetic drugs (ashiya and smith, 2007; isaji, 2007). in a previous
study, we discovered sergliﬂozin etabonate, a selective  xxxg2141xxx  inhibitor,
which is a prodrug based on benzylphenol glucoside, and validated
the critical role of  xxxg2141xxx  for modulation of the plasma glucose level
(katsuno et al., 2007). sergliﬂozin etabonate causes excess glucose to
be discarded in the urine by inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption, and
controls energy balance in a negative direction (isaji, 2007; katsuno
et al., 2007).

type 2 diabetes has increased worldwide in incidence with
excessive calorie intake and sedentary lifestyles. the basic management of type 2 diabetes is achieved by lifestyle interventions such
as dietary changes and exercise (nathan et al., 2006). from the point
of view of energy balance, sergliﬂozin etabonate may be a new antidiabetic drug that depends on the same principle as lifestyle intervention (isaji, 2007). to maintain good glycemic control in diabetic
patients, several antidiabetic drugs have been used as treatments;
however, these drugs carry some adverse effects. sulfonylureas stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells (proks et al., 2002), but
have the risk of causing hypoglycemia and body weight gain (salas and
caro, 2002; hermansen and mortensen, 2007). alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are effective at improving postprandial hyperglycemia by delaying
carbohydrate digestion (baron, 1998), and thus gastrointestinal symptoms are their side effects (vichayanrat et al., 2002). thiazolidinediones promote adipocyte differentiation and improve insulin
sensitivity (ferre, 2004), but body weight control may be compromised because glucose is accumulated as fat (nesto et al., 2004;
hermansen and mortensen, 2007).
in this report, focusing on the proﬁle of sergliﬂozin etabonate
compared with that of  xxxd2202xxx , a sulfonylurea, or  xxxd3524xxx , an alpha-

glucosidase inhibitor, we examined the potency and safety of
sergliﬂozin etabonate in normal and  xxxd3249xxx -induced diabetic
rats. furthermore, we evaluated the effects of acute and chronic
treatment with sergliﬂozin etabonate on hyperglycemia and body
weight in zucker fatty rats, which display hyperinsulinemia and
obesity.
2. materials and methods
2.1. chemicals
sergliﬂozin etabonate (2-[(4-methoxyphenyl)methyl]phenyl 6o-ethoxycarbonyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside), sergliﬂozin (2-[(4-methoxyphenyl)methyl]phenyl beta-d-glucopyranoside),  xxxd2202xxx , and  xxxd3524xxx  were synthesized by kissei pharmaceutical co., ltd. phlorizin
dihydrate and methyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoside (amg) were purchased
from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo). methyl-alpha-d-[u-14c]glucopyranoside was obtained from ge healthcare bio-sciences (little
chalfont, buckinghamshire, uk).
2.2. inhibitory effects on rat sglts
rat  xxxg2140xxx  and  xxxg2141xxx  expression plasmids were constructed as
described previously (fujimori et al., 2008). cell culture, transfection
procedure and the amg uptake experiment were performed as
described previously (katsuno et al., 2007; fujimori et al., 2008).
2.3. animals
male sprague–dawley (sd) rats and wistar rats were purchased
from japan slc, inc. (hamamatsu, japan). male zucker fatty rats were
obtained from charles river japan, inc. (yokohama, japan). these
rodents were housed under a 12-h/12-h light cycle (light on 8:00 am
to 8:00 pm) under controlled conditions (room temperature, 20–
26 °c; humidity, 35–65%) and fed a laboratory chow diet (ce-2 pellets;
clea japan, inc.) and water ad libitum. all animal experiments were
performed in accordance with the guidelines approved by the
laboratory animal committee of kissei pharmaceutical co., ltd.
2.4. urinary glucose excretion in normal and diabetic rats
male sd rats (5 weeks of age) were intravenously injected with
 xxxd3249xxx  (35 mg/kg, wako pure chemicals, osaka, japan) to
make them mildly diabetic. sergliﬂozin etabonate was suspended
(5 ml/kg) in 0.5% sodium carboxymethylcellulose and orally administered to sd rats and mildly diabetic rats (7 weeks of age). urine was
collected for 24 h after administration while the animals were kept
in metabolic cages. after the urine volume had been measured, the
glucose concentration in the urine was determined using a glucose btest wako (wako pure chemicals), and then the urinary glucose excretion was calculated.
2.5. oral sucrose tolerance test in normal and diabetic rats
male sd rats were intraperitoneally injected with  xxxd3249xxx 
(50 mg/kg, wako pure chemicals) 1 day after birth to make neonatal
 xxxd3249xxx -induced diabetic rats. male wistar rats and neonatal
 xxxd3249xxx -induced diabetic rats (12 weeks of age) were fasted for
16 h. sergliﬂozin etabonate,  xxxd2202xxx  or  xxxd3524xxx  (5 ml/kg, in 0.1%
 xxxd2609xxx ) and sucrose solution (500 g/l, 5 ml/kg) were
administered orally. blood was obtained in heparinized and aprotinin-treated tubes from a tail vein at each sampling point. plasma
glucose concentrations were determined using a glucose cii-test
wako (wako pure chemicals). plasma insulin was determined using
an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (morinaga institute of
biological science, inc., yokohama, japan).

2.6. acute administration in normal and diabetic rats
male sd rats (5 weeks of age) were intravenously injected with
 xxxd3249xxx  (35 or 40 mg/kg, wako pure chemicals) to prepare
mildly diabetic or moderately diabetic rats, respectively. sergliﬂozin
etabonate was orally administered to male wistar rats (12 weeks of
age) and to mildly and moderately diabetic rats (7 weeks of age) in the
fed condition. blood was obtained from a tail vein at each sampling
point. blood glucose concentrations were measured with a glucose
analyzer, antsense ii (bayer medical ltd., tokyo, japan).
2.7. effects on plasma glucose level in fasted normal rats
sergliﬂozin etabonate or  xxxd2202xxx  was orally administered to male
wistar rats (12 weeks of age) after 16-h fasting. plasma glucose concentrations were measured as described above.
2.8. acute administration in zucker fatty rats
sergliﬂozin etabonate was orally administered to zucker fatty rats
(18 weeks of age) in the fed condition. blood glucose concentrations were
measured as described above. the area under the curve (auc) 0–6 h for
blood glucose was calculated from the blood glucose concentration.
2.9. chronic administration in zucker fatty rats
sergliﬂozin etabonate was orally administered to zucker fatty rats
(18 weeks of age) twice daily for 2 weeks. body weight and food intake
were measured per week. at the end of the administration period,
glycated hemoglobin was determined using a total glycated
hemoglobin kit (sigma-aldrich). after 2 weeks of administration,
the oral glucose tolerance test (400 g/l, 5 ml/kg) was performed.
plasma glucose concentrations were determined as described above.
the auc0–4 h for plasma glucose was calculated from the plasma
glucose concentration during the oral glucose tolerance test.
2.10. statistical analysis
data were presented as means ± s.e.m. for each group. statistical
analysis was performed by using sas systems version 8.2 (sas institute inc. cary, nc). statistical signiﬁcance was determined with univariate repeated-measures analysis as a split-plot design and multiple
comparisons by each time period or dunnett's test as appropriate.
3. results
3.1. inhibitory effects on rat sglts
orally administered sergliﬂozin etabonate is metabolized to its
active form, sergliﬂozin, in the body. the inhibitory effects of sergliﬂozin etabonate, sergliﬂozin, and phlorizin, a nonselective sglt inhibitor, on amg uptake into cos-7 cells transiently transfected with the
rat sglt expression plasmid are shown in fig. 1. dose-dependent
inhibition was observed with each of these drugs. the ki values for
sergliﬂozin etabonate, sergliﬂozin, and phlorizin toward rat sglts are
shown in table 1. for rat  xxxg2141xxx , the inhibitory effect of sergliﬂozin was
twice greater than that of phlorizin, but for  xxxg2140xxx , it was approximately one-third of that of phlorizin. the ratio of selectivity (ki value of
rat  xxxg2140xxx /ki value of rat  xxxg2141xxx ) of sergliﬂozin and phlorizin was 41
and approximately 7, respectively. these data suggest that sergliﬂozin,
the active form of sergliﬂozin etabonate, is selective for rat  xxxg2141xxx .
3.2. effects on urinary glucose excretion in normal and diabetic rats
sergliﬂozin etabonate was orally administered to normal and
mildly diabetic rats. in these rats, urinary glucose excretion was

(fig. 3d and f). on the other hand,  xxxd2202xxx  stimulated the insulin
secretion (fig. 3e). in neonatal  xxxd3249xxx -induced diabetic rats,
postprandial hyperglycemia was improved by sergliﬂozin etabonate
(1–10 mg/kg) as well as by  xxxd3524xxx  (0.01–0.03 mg/kg; fig. 4a
and c); in contrast,  xxxd2202xxx  did not improve the postprandial hyperglycemia in these diabetic rats (fig. 4b).
3.4. effects of acute administration on blood glucose level in normal and
diabetic rats
next, sergliﬂozin etabonate was orally administered to normal,
mildly diabetic, and moderately diabetic rats in the fed condition.
blood glucose levels in the normal rats were not signiﬁcantly changed
by sergliﬂozin etabonate (fig. 5a). in the mildly diabetic and moderately diabetic rats, however, the blood glucose levels were significantly reduced at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg of sergliﬂozin etabonate
(fig. 5b and c). the glucose-lowering effect of sergliﬂozin etabonate
persisted for 6 h at the dose of 10 mg/kg in the moderately diabetic

increased by sergliﬂozin etabonate in a dose-dependent manner
(fig. 2). in the normal rats, no signiﬁcant changes in urine volume were
observed at either dose (10.5 ± 1.9, 9.9 ± 0.8, 9.9 ± 0.7, 11.1 ± 0.6 and
13.2 ± 0.4 ml for 0 (vehicle),1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg group, respectively).
in diabetic rats, a diuretic effect was observed at 30 mg/kg (12.6 ± 1.0,
13.4 ± 1.2, 15.5 ± 1.1, 15.3 ± 1.2 and 19.7 ± 2.3 ml for 0 (vehicle), 1, 3, 10,
and 30 mg/kg group, respectively). the excretion of glucose into the
urine by sergliﬂozin etabonate was thus enhanced in the diabetic state.
3.3. effects on postprandial hyperglycemia in the oral sucrose tolerance
test
in the oral sucrose tolerance test, the effects of sergliﬂozin etabonate on postprandial hyperglycemia were compared with those of
 xxxd2202xxx  and  xxxd3524xxx . sergliﬂozin etabonate,  xxxd2202xxx , and  xxxd3524xxx  dose-dependently inhibited the increase in plasma glucose after
sucrose loading in normal rats (fig. 3a, b, and c). sergliﬂozin etabonate and  xxxd3524xxx  had a tendency to decrease the plasma insulin
level corresponding to the reduction in the plasma glucose level

rats (fig. 5c). the degree of the antihyperglycemic effects of
sergliﬂozin etabonate correlated with the severity of the diabetic
condition.
3.5. effects on plasma glucose level in fasted normal rats
sergliﬂozin etabonate did not alter the plasma glucose level in 16-h
fasted normal rats (fig. 6a), but  xxxd2202xxx  caused a hypoglycemia of
approximately 60 mg/dl plasma glucose (fig. 6b). these data suggest
that sergliﬂozin etabonate has a less risk of causing hypoglycemia
than  xxxd2202xxx .
3.6. antihyperglycemic effects of acute and chronic administration in
zucker fatty rats
in zucker fatty rats with hyperinsulinemia and obesity, acute
administration of sergliﬂozin etabonate also showed its antihyperglycemic effects at the doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg (fig. 7a) and reduced the
auc0–6 h for blood glucose in a dose-dependent manner (fig. 7b). to

examine the effects of chronic administration, we orally administered
vehicle or sergliﬂozin etabonate (10 or 30 mg/kg) to zucker fatty rats
twice daily for 2 weeks. sergliﬂozin etabonate affected neither the
body weight (622.6 ± 12.4, 614.7 ± 23.2, and 615.8 ± 15.6 g for vehicle,
10 mg/kg group, and 30 mg/kg group, respectively) nor the food
intake (30.6 ± 2.0, 29.5 ± 2.5, and 32.1 ± 1.3 g for vehicle, 10 mg/kg
group, and 30 mg/kg group, respectively) at the end of the treatment.
sergliﬂozin etabonate reduced both glycated hemoglobin (fig. 8a)
and the fasting plasma glucose (fig. 8b) levels in a dose-dependent
manner. after 2 weeks of administration, the oral glucose tolerance
test was performed. chronic treatment with sergliﬂozin etabonate
also reduced the value for plasma glucose (fig. 8b) and the auc for
plasma glucose (fig. 8c) in a dose-dependent manner during the oral
glucose tolerance test.

k1 cells stably expressing human sglt (katsuno et al., 2007). in this
present study, we evaluated the potency of sergliﬂozin etabonate and
sergliﬂozin toward rat sglts in transiently transfected cos-7 cells,
and observed dose-dependent inhibitions by each of these drugs
(fig. 1). based on the ki values, we conﬁrmed sergliﬂozin to be potent
and selective for rat  xxxg2141xxx , with a selectivity ratio of 41 (table 1).
based on results obtained with a transient expression system similar
to ours, pajor et al. (2008) reported ki values of sergliﬂozin for human
 xxxg2140xxx  and  xxxg2141xxx  of 960 nm and 18 nm, respectively. these data
indicate that sergliﬂozin is potent and selective for human  xxxg2141xxx , as
we showed for rat  xxxg2141xxx . thus, there appears to be little species
difference in  xxxg2141xxx  inhibition.
urinary glucose excretion was increased in a dose-dependent
manner by oral administration of sergliﬂozin etabonate in the normal
and mildly diabetic rats. the excretion of glucose into the urine by
sergliﬂozin etabonate was enhanced in the diabetic state. as was
shown in fig. 5, the blood glucose level in normal and mildly diabetic
rats was approximately 110 and 200 mg/dl, respectively. thus, sergli-

ﬂozin etabonate promoted excretion of glucose in urine depending on
the blood glucose level. the increase in urinary glucose excretion by
sergliﬂozin etabonate may be of concern regarding its effects on urine
volume and urinary excretion of electrolytes. in a previous study, we
reported that sergliﬂozin etabonate had no obvious effect on urinary
electrolyte excretion, though a temporary osmotic diuresis was
observed at 30 mg/kg of it (katsuno et al., 2007). additionally, in
normal rats, repeated administration of sergliﬂozin etabonate (300
and 1000 mg/kg for 3 weeks) increased the urine volume, but had
little effect on urinary electrolyte excretion and plasma electrolyte
levels (data not shown). we suppose that sergliﬂozin etabonate
increased urinary glucose excretion without inducing either a marked
osmotic diuresis or an electrolyte imbalance at pharmacological doses.
we evaluated the potency of and risk of hypoglycemia with
sergliﬂozin etabonate under normoglycemic and hyperglycemic
conditions. in the oral sucrose tolerance test, sergliﬂozin etabonate
suppressed postprandial hyperglycemia in normal and neonatal
 xxxd3249xxx -induced diabetic rats (figs. 3a and 4a). rapid- and

insulinemia. but acute treatment with sergliﬂozin etabonate showed
the antihyperglycemic effects in these rats (fig. 7), which effect was
due to an antihyperglycemic mechanism not dependent on insulin
secretion (fig. 3d). thiazolidinediones can ameliorate the diabetic
condition by improving insulin resistance in this model (ikeda et al.,
1990; buckingham et al., 1998). chronic treatment with sergliﬂozin
etabonate reduced both glycated hemoglobin and fasting plasma
glucose levels, and improved the glycemic response after glucose
loading in zucker fatty rats (fig. 8) as well as thiazolidinediones
(minoura et al., 2005, 2007). additionally, no gastrointestinal side
effects such as diarrhea or soft feces as a consequence of inhibition of
intestinal  xxxg2140xxx  were observed in chronically treated zucker fatty
rats. thus, excretion of excess plasma glucose via urine can contribute
to the normalization of glucose metabolism through suppressing
glucose toxicity different from the mechanism of thiazolidinediones.
although increases in body weight and food intake have been
reported in thiazolidinedione-treated zucker fatty rats (wang et al.,
1997; de souza et al., 2001), sergliﬂozin etabonate affected neither the
body weight nor the food intake in these rats. an increase in urinary
glucose excretion by sergliﬂozin etabonate leads to a negative energy

short-acting insulin secretagogues or alpha-glucosidase inhibitors have
often been evaluated in neonatal  xxxd3249xxx -induced diabetic rats
(ikenoue et al., 1997; ichikawa et al., 2002). sergliﬂozin etabonate
provided a parallel to these antidiabetic drugs as a way of improving
postprandial hyperglycemia in these diabetic rats.  xxxd2202xxx  did not
ameliorate the postprandial hyperglycemia in these diabetic rats with
impaired insulin secretion, which lack of effect may have been due
to the delayed onset of insulin secretion stimulated by  xxxd2202xxx . in
addition, sergliﬂozin etabonate showed antihyperglycemic effects in
rats with either mildly and moderately  xxxd3249xxx -induced diabetes in the fed condition; whereas the blood glucose levels in normal
rats were not signiﬁcantly changed (fig. 5). the reduction in the blood
glucose level was increased by sergliﬂozin etabonate to a greater
degree in the hyperglycemic state than in the normoglycemic state.
the antihyperglycemic effect of sergliﬂozin etabonate or  xxxd3524xxx  did
not depend on increased insulin secretion (fig. 3, d or f, respectively).
in addition, in 16-h fasted normal rats, sergliﬂozin etabonate did not
induce hypoglycemia (fig. 6), which is a major side effect of sulfonylureas (salas and caro, 2002). the lowering of blood glucose
without stimulating insulin secretion is a considerable advantage
of sergliﬂozin etabonate for clinical use. in addition, at the time of
combination with sulfonylurea, sergliﬂozin etabonate may reduce the
required dose of sulfonylurea. this may preserve the insulin secretion
from beta-cells and diminish the promotion of weight gain by insulin.
next, we evaluated the antihyperglycemic effects of sergliﬂozin
etabonate in zucker fatty rats with hyperinsulinemia and obesity.
sulfonylureas may not be effective in these rats because of hyper-

the auc0–4 h for plasma glucose (c) was calculated from the plasma glucose concentration during the oral glucose tolerance test. data are presented as means ± s.e.m. (n = 4–5).

balance. thus chronic treatment with sergliﬂozin etabonate was
beneﬁcial for suppressing body weight gain in addition to improving
the glycemic control.
several drug companies are developing  xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors for the
treatment of diabetes, and have conﬁrmed the therapeutic potency
and safety of  xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors compared with those of other antidiabetic drugs. in this study, we demonstrated that sergliﬂozin etabonate increased urinary glucose excretion, and consequently
improved hyperglycemia in correlation with the blood glucose level.
sergliﬂozin etabonate did not induce hypoglycemia or excessive
insulin secretion. chronic treatment with sergliﬂozin etabonate
reduced the levels of glycated hemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose
without inducing any gain in body weight. these properties of sergliﬂozin etabonate enable it to be suitable for blood glucose control with
body weight control and prevention of exhaustion of the pancreatic
beta-cells. in this sense, sergliﬂozin etabonate has several advantages
compared with sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. we suggest
that sergliﬂozin etabonate may have a unique proﬁle as an antidiabetic
drug by improving glycemic control without its use resulting in insulin
secretion, hypoglycemia or body weight gain.
