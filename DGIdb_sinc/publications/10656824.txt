serine hydroxymethyltransferase (ec 2.1.2.1), a member of the a-class of
 xxxd3047xxx  enzymes, catalyzes the reversible interconversion of
serine and glycine, changing the chemical bonding at the ca-cb bond of
the serine side-chain mediated by the  xxxd3047xxx  cofactor. scission of the ca-cb bond of serine substrate produces a glycine product
and most likely formaldehyde, which reacts without dissociation with  xxxd3334xxx  cofactor. crystal structures of the human and
rabbit cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferases (shmt) con®rmed
their close similarity in tertiary and dimeric subunit structure to each
other and to aspartate aminotransferase, the archetypal a-class pyridoxal

50 -phosphate enzyme. we describe here the structure at 2.4 a
of escherichia coli serine hydroxymethyltransferase in ternary complex
with glycine and 5-formyl  xxxd3334xxx , re®ned to an rfactor value of 17.4 % and rfree value of 19.6 %. this structure reveals the
interactions of both cofactors and glycine substrate with the enzyme.
comparison with the e. coli aspartate aminotransferase structure shows
the distinctions in sequence and structure which de®ne the folate cofactor
binding site in serine hydroxymethyltransferase and the differences in
orientation of the amino terminal arm, the evolution of which was
necessary for elaboration of the folate binding site. comparison with the
unliganded rabbit cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase structure
identi®es changes in the conformation of the enzyme, similar to those
observed in aspartate aminotransferase, that probably accompany the
binding of substrate. the tetrameric quaternary structure of liganded
e. coli serine hydroxymethyltransferase also differs in symmetry and relative disposition of the functional tight dimers from that of the unliganded
eukaryotic enzymes. shmt tetramers have surface charge distributions
which suggest distinctions in folate binding between eukaryotic and
e. coli enzymes. the structure of the e. coli ternary complex provides the
basis for a thorough investigation of its mechanism through characterization and structure determination of site mutants.

structure of serine hydroxymethyltransferase

introduction
serine hydroxymethyltransferase (shmt; ec
2.1.2.1) is a  xxxd3047xxx  (plp) requiring
enzyme whose physiological role is to catalyze the
formation of single carbon groups for a number of
biosynthetic pathways. the favored mechanism of
shmt consists of two coordinately catalyzed reactions: cleavage of plp-serine external aldimine to
form plp-glycine external aldimine and undissociated formaldehyde (i-iii in scheme 1); followed
by condensation of the formaldehyde with h4pteglun to form 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (iv-vi
in scheme 1). the serine and glycine external aldimines are rapidly converted to the internal aldimine in which c40 of plp is bound to the e-amino
group of lys229{ (not shown in scheme 1). other

ary and tertiary structure, and show topological
similarity to the aat structure. like the a-class
plp enzymes, shmt exists as a tight dimer,
although the three independent crystal structures
also show weaker association of these dimers into
tetramers.
the hc and rcshmt structures were of the
internal aldimine form of the enzyme, in which the
active site lys229 is covalently linked as a schiff's
base to the c40 carbon atom of the plp ring. in
addition, the structure of a form of the rcshmt
was determined in which this aldimine linkage
was chemically reduced and thereby equivalent to
the gem diamine intermediate of the reaction pathway. this structure showed a rotation of the plp
ring relative to that in the internal aldimine, resembling the changes observed in the aat active site

scheme 1.

3-hydroxy-amino acids can also serve as substrates
of shmt, and the overall reaction is completely
reversible.
despite its almost complete lack of sequence
similarity to the aspartate aminotransferase (aat)
family of pyridoxyl 50 -phosphate enzymes, the conservation of a small number of mechanistically
important residues and properties of site-mutants
led to the correct inference that shmt belongs to
the a-family of plp enzymes and shares a similar
tertiary fold and mechanism (pascarella et al.,
1993). this was subsequently con®rmed by the
determination of the human (renwick et al, 1998)
and rabbit (scarsdale et al., 1999) shmt crystal
structures, which are virtually identical in second-

in its several intermediate states (jansonius, 1998).
neither the human nor rabbit shmt structure was
determined with bound h4pteglun cofactor or substrate, and the roles of functional groups at the
active site could only be hypothesized. the distinctive sequence and structural features of shmt
which confer its af®nity for folate cofactor, while
still retaining its identity as an a-plp enzyme,
have not been identi®ed, and the mechanisms
of both serine cleavage/formation and the many
reactions with non-serine substrates which are
catalyzed by shmt (schirch, 1984, 1998), remain
to be determined.
we describe here the crystal structure of a ternary complex of e. coli shmt with bound glycine

{ sequence numbering is as described by scarsdale et al. (1999).

product (substrate) and the stable h4pteglun analogue, 5-formyl- xxxd3334xxx . the polyglutamate form
of the latter is a slow, tight-binding inhibitor of the
reaction (stover & schirch, 1991). in this structure,
the glycine product/substrate is covalently linked
to the c40 carbon atom of the plp ring as either
the external aldimine or quinoid intermediate of
the shmt reaction pathway (structures iii and ii,
scheme 1). the bound 5-formyl- xxxd3334xxx  is proximal to the glycine and plp ring, consistent with a
short path for the migration of the hydroxymethyl
(formaldehyde) group to the folate cofactor.
a change in orientation of several non-contiguous
segments of each monomer subunit of the eshmt
ternary complex relative to the unliganded structure of the rabbit rcshmt can be detected, and
may be analogous to that observed in aat upon
substrate binding. the loci of groups which interact with the plp cofactor in eshmt generally
correspond with that of aat, but the identities of
these plp ligands differ from those of aat, as
would be expected from the close similarity of
their three-dimensional structures but weak amino
acid sequence identity.
experimental evidence shows that 5-formylh4pteglun is an analog of intermediate v in
scheme 1 and that the rates of some steps are
modulated by the length of the polyglutamate tail
of h4pteglun (n  1 for the 5-formyl-h4pteglun in
the complex described here). the pteridine ring
and 5-formyl group make a larger number of
hydrogen bond interactions with the protein than
is observed for some other known structures of
folate or folate analog complexes with enzymes
( xxxg631xxx  (lee et al., 1996),  xxxg2366xxx  (finer-moore et al., 1993)), resembling
more closely  xxxd149xxx  ribonucleotide transformylase (klein et al., 1995) and the binding of the
pteridine of dihydropteridine synthase (varughese,
et al., 1992) in this respect.
in solution, the formyl group can exist as either
of two rotamers that interconvert on a time-scale of
seconds, but only one of these rotamers binds to
shmt and is observed in the crystal structure of
this ternary complex. the tight dimers of eshmt
in the ternary complex crystal structure interact
with two other tight dimers to form two different
weak tetramers, neither of which is the same as
that observed for the tetramers of hc or rcshmt.
these unusual quaternary symmetries of the
eshmt weak tetramer render the environments of
the monoglutamyl groups of the 5-formyl- xxxd3334xxx  in each tight dimer, non-equivalent. the glycine substrate/product is bound in a mode
resembling the substrates of aat, its amino group
slightly out of the plane of the plp ring and its carboxylate group ion-paired to an arginine residue
and hydrogen-bonded to a serine side-chain. the
active site region of eshmt has the same amino
acids, contributed by both subunits of the dimer,
as were noted in the structures of hcshmt and
rcshmt. their proximity to the substrate and

cofactors of the eshmt complex further implicates
them as catalytic functional groups.
inferences drawn from comparison of the
eshmt structure with the hcshmt and rcshmt
structures must be quali®ed by the several variables distinguishing them. permutations of species
differences, conditions of high and low ionic
strength in crystallization, differences in lattice
interactions, and complexation with substrate and
cofactor may confound comparisons. mitigating
this ambiguity are the observations that the structures of the hcshmt and rcshmt are virtually
identical and that the hcshmt and rcshmt monomer structures are closely similar to that of
eshmt, despite differences in sequence, ionic
strength of crystallization, lattice contacts and the
presence of ligands. it appears from our current
knowledge that ionic strength has little effect on
local structure of monomeric and dimeric shmt,
but it may in¯uence quaternary structure.
sequence similarity among the shmt molecules
from different species is quite high and appears to
have had only local in¯uence on chain conformation, primarily at inserts and deletions in loops.
the analysis and interpretation of the differences
in structure between the eukaryotic internal aldimine shmt structures and the external aldimine
ternary complex of eshmt focuses on the potential
mechanistic signi®cance of these differences, but
where pertinent, we note possible ambiguities.

results and discussion
the three known structures of shmt are all
loose dimers of tight dimers. speci®c amino acid
residues are identi®ed here by number with a pre®x of a, b, c or d, referring to the monomer subunit to which it belongs (tight dimers are a  b and
c d). sequence numbering is based on that of the
eshmt, as proposed by scarsdale et al. (1999).
quality of the structure
the polypeptide backbone of eshmt is uninterrupted and complete except for the amino-terminal
methionine residue, which is missing in subunits a
and d. the ramachandran plot shows that all
but eight non-glycine, non-terminal amino acid
residues lie within the core or most restrictive
extension region of allowed values. these eight are
the four pairs of asn316 and thr359 in each monomer of the tetramer. asn316 is at the center of a
®ve-residue turn and its side-chain is multiply
hydrogen bonded in its tucked-in position. thr359
is the p5 residue of a b-turn in which p2 is a proline residue, and the carbonyl group of the p1 residue hydrogen bonds to the peptide nh group of
thr359, skipping p4. pro258 is a cis-proline residue
like its counterpart in the hcshmt structure, but
we observe no distortion in the main-chain dihedral angles at lys229, as is observed at this residue
in the human enzyme, nor is there a hydrogen
bond between the carbonyl oxygen atom of residue

sequence, have little density beyond the cb atom.

of the 16 residues at six positions in the tetramer
which have non-canonical side-chain conformations, three are solvent-exposed (gln289, lys405
and asp395), but the other three are polar (asn53,
lys54 and lys346) and buried or shielded from
solvent. these latter residues make multiple hydrogen bonds or ion-pairs with other buried charged
side-chains, probably accounting for their noncanonical side-chain dihedral angles. a total of
397 immobilized solvent molecules are included in
the ®nal re®ned structure. figure 1 shows the
(2mfo ÿ dfc) electron density based on ®nal
re®ned phases around the active site of the eshmt
ternary complex.
conformation and relationship to aat family
of a -plp enzymes
e. coli shmt forms a tight homodimer similar to
that of aat and other a-plp enzymes, with the
active site at the interface of the two monomers.
the eshmt monomer fold resembles the topology
of the aat monomer and superposition of the
amino-terminal secondary structures of eshmt
and eaat, permits a mapping of these two
sequences onto each other (figure 2). the program
compare3d (shinyalov & bourne, 1998) gave very
similar results for correspondence of structure,
with only single amino acid differences in the register of secondary structure elements. this
sequence alignment further con®rms the very low
sequence identity between these two proteins, but
shows a strong linear register of secondary structure elements, consistent with the similarity of tertiary folds. if the regions of greatest local structure

local differences in the two structures, suggestive
of multiple accommodations in conformation
imposed by sequence changes and insertions and
deletions, and in many places there is limited but
signi®cant relative displacement of corresponding
secondary structure elements.
the correlation of these two sequences through
their structures also identi®es the differences
between them related to the additional participation of the folate group in shmt-catalyzed
chemistry. the most conspicuous of these differences is the orientation of the amino-terminal arm,
which extends from each monomer in aat, and
also in shmt, to partially wrap around the other
monomer of the tight dimer. the orientation and
direction of these arms is different in shmt relative to aat and the superposition of the two structures shows that if shmt adopted the same
orientation of its extended amino-terminal arm as
aat, this arm would intrude into the site where
the 5-formyl- xxxd3334xxx  is bound in shmt
(figure 3). the reorientation of this amino-terminal
arm must have been an essential change in the
evolution of the folate binding site of shmt. it
appears to be a consequence of the sequence insertion at residues 336 to 341 in shmt, which contacts the amino-terminal arm of the same monomer
and forces a change in the orientation of that
amino-terminal arm.
localized differences in sequence between eaat
and eshmt also correlate with contact regions
between shmt and its folate cofactor. a small
insertion at 121-124 of shmt is in a segment containing leu121,  xxxg125xxx  and leu127, all of which are
ligands of the pteridine ring. a deletion of three
amino acid residues at 173 of eshmt relative to
aat brings this segment close to the pteridine
ring. immediately after the 336-341 insertion,
which redirects the amino-terminal arm, asn347
makes a double hydrogen bond interaction with
n1 and n8 of the pteridine ring and following this,
the insertion around 390 introduces arginine and

residue of the 5-formyl- xxxd3334xxx  and may also
bind to more distal glutamate residues on polyglutamylated folate.
comparison of eshmt monomer structure with
that of rcshmt and hcshmt
the rcshmt structure, which is virtually identical with that of hcshmt, with the exception of
terminal extensions, served as the molecular replacement model for the solution of the eshmt structure. the extension at the amino terminus of
rcshmt relative to eshmt makes few, if any, new
contacts with the other monomer. however, it
induces an a-helical segment from residue ÿ8 to
4 in the rcshmt arm that does not exist in the
eshmt amino terminus. the sequence insertions
at residues 244-245 and between 390 and 400 in
the eukaryotic enzymes determine differences in
quaternary structure from that of eshmt and also

play a role in the binding of the polyglutamate tail
of the folate (see below).
although the structures of the unliganded
eukaryotic and eshmt ternary complex monomers
are closely similar, there are signi®cant differences
in orientation of parts of the carboxyl-terminal
domain and in a segment of the amino-terminal
sequence (figure 4). this is reminiscent of the
difference between substrate-bound and free aat
in which the small domain, consisting of the carboxyl-terminal 65 amino acid residues and the
amino-terminal arm, moves with respect to the rest
of the molecule on binding of 2-methylaspartate
substrate analog inhibitor (mcphalen et al., 1992;
okamoto et al., 1994). in the rcshmt/eshmt pair,
the differences are complex and cannot be
described by a simple transposition of a single
domain. the genesis of the conformational change
on substrate binding in shmt appears to be in the
interaction of the substrate with two residues,
arga363 and sera35. the carboxylate group of the

substrate in the ternary complex described here
forms a tight ion pair with the guanidino group of
arga363 and also to the side-chain hydroxyl
group of sera35. these interactions cause small
movements of the chains in which the arga363
and sera35 lie, which in turn induce movements
in distal parts of the structure. speci®cally, the segment from residue a281 (at an interhelical bend) to
a365 is hinged at its two termini, and the small
movement at arga363 near one of these hinges
appears to be magni®ed at the extrema from the
hinge due to the long lever arm. coordinated with
this is a small movement of the amino terminus up
to a39 induced by the interaction of sera35 with

the glycine substrate carboxylate group. residues
a30-a32 are in b-sheet linkage with a341-a343,
and the displacement of the former is synchronous
with the latter, which in turn lies within the
domain whose movement propagates from the
interaction of the substrate carboxylate group with
arga363. thus, the small displacements emanating
from sera35 and arga363 are interlocked in the
same moving domain from a281 to a365. surprisingly, the segment from a367 to a392 is not displaced in eshmt relative to rcshmt, but the
carboxyl terminus from a392 to the end is moved,
probably in tandem with the movement of the
amino-terminal segment with which it is in contact.

structure of serine hydroxymethyltransferase

this movement cannot be localized to a single
change in main-chain dihedral angle, as is the case
for the open and closed forms of eaat (okamoto
et al., 1994), but rather appears to be the result of a
number of small angle changes emanating from
the hinge boundaries.
these movements of non-contiguous parts of
eshmt in its ternary complex relative to unliganded rcshmt generally resemble the transition
which occurs in aat from an ``open'' to ``closed''
form on the binding of aspartate or 2-methylaspartate in the active site, but are smaller in magnitude
ê -3.0 a
ê maximum). a change in thermal stab(2.5 a
ility has been observed in shmt on binding of serine and to a lesser extent, glycine substrate (stover
et al., 1992). this change in structural stability of
shmt has been ascribed to a conformational
change in shmt like that in aat, and is consistent
with the structures of ligand-free rcshmt and
ternary complex eshmt compared here. there are
no lattice contacts which are likely to be direct
in¯uences on these parts of the molecules in the
two different structures, and the close similarity
between the sequences and the conformations of
the human and rabbit shmt molecules and that of
eshmt argue in favor of the bound ligand(s) as
the source of this structure difference. a potential
biological signi®cance of this change in structure
on binding of amino acid substrate is that two of
the segments (around 350 and 390-400) which lie
in the moved domain are implicated in the binding
of the polyglutamate tail of bound folate. it
appears that shmt has exploited and modi®ed the
open to closed transition of the a-type plp
enzymes to engage a part of the folate substrate/
cofactor. there also appears to be reciprocity
between these two remote binding sites for shmt
substrates, since the binding of the pentaglutamate
forms of 5-formyl-h4pteglun and 5-methyl- xxxd3334xxx , but not the monoglutamate forms, induces a
decrease of two orders of magnitude in the dissociation constant of glycine substrate (matthews
et al., 1982; stover & schirch, 1991).
quaternary structure: significance for binding
of folate polyglutamate
the asymmetric unit of the eshmt crystal structure is a tetramer consisting of two tight dimers.
these tight dimers are closely similar to the tight
dimers of hcshmt and rcshmt, and are stabilized
by a large number of hydrogen bond and van der
waals interactions, including many bound solvent
molecules. the contact surface area of rcshmt
ê 2 and that in
monomers in the tight dimer is 8679 a
2
ê
hcshmt is 9249 a , the difference probably arising
from the differential truncation of the amino termini
in rcshmt, where electron density is missing. the
contact surface area for the monomers in the
ê 2, larger than that of
eshmt tight dimer is 9502 a
the eukaryotic shmt dimers, despite its shorter
amino terminus. therefore, in eshmt there is a
slightly greater contact area in the interface exclu-

161
sive of the amino termini than in hc and rcshmt
dimers. the tight dimers in the three crystal forms
of shmt are consistent with observations in solution on a mutant sheep  xxxg2068xxx  that is active as a
dimer (jagath et al., 1997), and we conclude that the
dimer is the minimum active oligomer of shmt.
there are two possible tetramers of eshmt in its
crystal lattice, neither of which is identical with the
tetramers of the hc and rcshmt molecules, both of
which have 222-symmetry. in hcshmt, each of the
four monomers of the tetramer are crystallographically related by 222-symmetry. in rcshmt, the
non-crystallographic, colinear tight dimer 2-fold
axes are perpendicular to a crystallographic 2-fold
axis, de®ning a tetramer with the same 222-symmetry as hcshmt. since the human and rabbit
cytosolic shmt proteins were crystallized from
high and low ionic strength conditions, respectively, this conformation and quaternary organization are not affected by this parameter. the
contact surface areas of the two e. coli tetramers
ê 2 and 834 a
ê 2, signi®cantly less than that
are 892 a
ê ) and hcshmt (1888 a
ê 2) tetraof rcshmt (1623 a
mers. there are relatively few speci®c interactions
between the dimers in the eshmt tetramers, and
their persistence in solution seems unlikely.
the difference in quaternary structure between
the eukaryotic and e. coli shmt molecules can be
ascribed to sequence differences between them.
the eukaryotic shmt molecules cannot form the
same tetramers as observed for eshmt because of
two sequence insertions in the eukaryotic shmt
molecules, at residues 134 and 244. eshmt does
not adopt the tetramer mode of the eukaryotic
shmts because of speci®c sequence differences
which remove the tetramer-stabilizing interactions
that occur in the latter. the his112 residue that lies
near the intersection of dyads at the center of the
hc and rcshmt tetramers is a proline residue in
eshmt, and the two identical ion pairs between
glu(141) and arg(115) on opposite dimers are
replaced in eshmt by glutamine and threonine
residues, respectively. phe165 in a hydrophobic
part of the interface is replaced by histidine in
eshmt and differences (leu(164) ! glu and
met(143) ! val) remove non-polar interactions
that would stabilize an eshmt tetramer like that
observed in hc and rcshmt. the insertion after
244 in eukaryotic shmt molecules also contributes
to the tetramer interface and is missing in eshmt.
while there seems to be no functional eshmt
tetramer, rcshmt exists entirely as tetramer under
physiological conditions, and this tetramer has a
distinct surface charge distribution and juxtaposition of active sites, both of which may have functional signi®cance. the surface charge distribution
of the eshmt dimer, calculated with formal
charges, shows a localized, positively charged strip
extending from the active site, and extensive
negatively charged surface region distal to the
active site (figure 5(a)). we previously calculated
an integrated (as opposed to formal charge) surface
charge distribution for the rcshmt monomer and

162

structure of serine hydroxymethyltransferase

found a similar localized channel of positive charge
extending from the active site (scarsdale et al.,
1999). we recalculated the formal (not integrated)
surface charge distribution for the rcshmt tetramer (figure 5(b)) and found that it has an extensive positive surface charge concentrated around
the 222 intersection. in comparison, the surface
charge distribution of a hypothetical tetramer of
eshmt modeled on the rcshmt tetramer template
retains the localized positive region around the
active site surrounded by peripheral negative surface charge (figure 5(c)). the contrast in charge
polarity between the rcshmt tetramer and either
the dimer or hypothetical tetramer of eshmt
arises in part from the difference in calculated pi
values between these two enzymes: pi  6.5 for
eshmt and pi  8.1 for rcshmt. it also suggests
that rcshmt may be a stronger, general attractor
for a polyanionic h4pteglun than eshmt.
the latter hypothetical model of eshmt in the
rcshmt quaternary structure also points up the
possible role of rcshmt sequence insertions
(shown in magenta in figure 5(c)) in folate binding
to rcshmt relative to eshmt. in the eshmt
dimer, folate binds on opposite sides of the dimer
due to the dyad operation. however, in the
rcshmt tetramer, the active sites of the a and c
monomers lie on one face and the b and d monomers on the opposite face. the polyglutamate tails
of the monomers of each of these pairs would
extend roughly parallel with each other from the
active site.
both eukaryotic and eshmt tight dimers have
similar binding sites for the proximal glutamyl
residues of the polyglutamate tail of the folate.
three loops and an a-helix form an inner
periphery, which de®nes the outward path that the
poly(glu) tail must take as it extends from the
active site of (e.g.) monomer a: a132-a135, a350a360, b57-b64 and b250-b258. however, in the
rcshmt tetramer, this inner site is extended and a
second outer interaction site is elaborated as a
result of the sequence insertions and the extended
region of positive surface charge present in the tetramer. an insert at 134 extends the ®rst of these

loops by three residues, all lysine or arginine residues, in rc and hcshmt. these are positioned to
interact with the second and third glutamate residues extending from the active site. a wider, outer
monomer a poly(glu) interaction site is de®ned by
sequence inserts at 244-245 on the b and c monomers and between residues 390 and 400 on the a
monomer. this extended site consists of two concentric, telescoped rings which create an infundibular cavity with its constricted end at the active
site, out of which the polyglutamate tail of the
modeled bound folate extends (green folate in
figure 5(c)). this cavity in the tetramer is the focus
of the concentrated cationic surface area composed
of parts of all four monomers. in contrast, the
hypothetical tetramer of eshmt dimers modeled
in the rcshmt structure has an attenuated cationic
binding site and the peripheral regions of the tetramer are predominantly anionic.
while not conclusive, this suggests that the
rcshmt tetramer plays a role in binding the
extended, polyglutamylated folates, which is
absent in the dimeric eshmt under physiological
in vitro conditions. this distinction may be related
to different charge surface requirements for binding the chemically distinct polyglutamate tails of
folates. in eukaryotes, the polyglutamate tail is
entirely g-linked, while in e. coli, only the ®rst
three glutamates are g-linked, subsequent ones
being a-linked. if co-evolution of these distinct
chemical linkages and their binding sites in shmt
has occurred, it may be re¯ected in distinct higherorder structures (dimers versus tetramers) for
e. coli versus eukaryotic shmt molecules.

ionic n1 atom of the plp ring with a buried aspartate side-chain (asp200), which is conserved in
most plp enzymes, and both have hydrogen
bonds to the unprotonated o30 atom. there are a
few more charge-compensating ligands of the
phosphoryl group in eaat than in eshmt. the
arga235 guanidino group in eshmt and rcshmt,
corresponding to the guanidino group of arg266
in eaat, is considerably farther from the phosphoryl group and makes no signi®cantly close contacts compared to the bridged pair of hydrogen
bonds to op1 and op2, which the latter makes in
eaat. in both eaat and eshmt, the amino terminus of an a-helix lies close to the phosphoryl
group, and another more distal terminal may also
contribute to charge neutralization.
the relative positions of the tyra225, sera257
and lysa258 ligands of the plp in eaat are coorê relative to the plp
dinately shifted by about 3.8 a
with respect to corresponding residues in eshmt
(his203, hisa228 and lysa229). one consequence
of this shift is that the reactive site lysine residue
(258 in aat and 229 in eshmt) of eshmt can
make a hydrogen bond with the side-chain og
atom of thr226, as was predicted from the internal
aldimine structure of rcshmt (scarsdale et al.,
1999, figure 6). the equivalent ser255 in eaat is
too far from the lysine side-chain of the external
aldimine to make a hydrogen bond, and its sidechain og atom is hydrogen-bonded to op3 of the
plp phosphoryl group. this difference would
favor external aldimine formation in shmt and
discriminate against abortive transamination by
stabilizing the unprotonated lys228 nz atom on
formation of the external aldimine. this prediction
is con®rmed by the eshmt mutant t226a, which
shows a greatly reduced rate of external aldimine
formation and accumulation of the gem diamine

structure of serine hydroxymethyltransferase

intermediate (angelaccio et al., 1992). the plp pyridoxal rings in both eaat and the shmt molecules are coplanar with planar side-chain rings
(trp140 in aat and his126 in shmt). the dihedral angles of the plp phosphomethylene group in
eshmt are: f  59  , c  ÿ 156  , and y  ÿ 36 
versus ÿ15  , ÿ177  , ÿ69  in eaat.
a surprising observation from the eshmt ternary complex structure relative to the hc and
rcshmt structures is the very small rotation (8  )
of the plp ring in the external aldimine structure
relative to the internal aldimine. the structure of
rcshmt in which the aldimine linkage is reduced
to resemble the gem diamine intermediate of the
reaction shows a rotation of 15  relative to the
unreduced form (scarsdale et al., 1999). by analogy
to the external aldimine structure of aat, we
anticipated a rotation of this ring of at least 15  .
the small movement (8  ) of this ring relative to
the internal aldimines of hc and rcshmt may be a
real distinction of the shmt mechanism from that
of aat, but could also be a consequence of the
simultaneous presence of the 5-formyl group on
the  xxxd3334xxx  and the glycine linked as the external
aldimine in the active site of the eshmt ternary
complex. these groups are at van der waal's contact distance, which would not permit any further
rotation of the plp ring.
 xxxd3334xxx  binding site
the pteridine ring and p-aminobenzoic acid
(paba) groups of the 5-formyl- xxxd3334xxx  glutamyl
cofactor are sequestered in the same pocket as the
plp group, and the single glutamyl group lies
exposed to solvent just at the surface of the
protein. the pteridine ring in the eshmt ternary
complex is parallel with that of the plp group, but

is shifted so that the two are not stacked. the pteridine ring forms a full set of hydrogen bonds with
the protein (table 2) and the phenol ring of
tyrb126 of the other monomer of the tight dimer
partially stacks on the p-amino-benzoyl ring of the
folate. the residues which interact with the  xxxd3334xxx  group are conserved in the sequences of 16
other representative shmt molecules.
glycine substrate, the 5-formyl group and
active site solvent molecule
the glycine residue in the aldimine linkage lies
between the plp and pteridine rings of the two
cofactors and is out of the plane of the extended
ê on the re face of c40 of the
plp p system by 0.43 a
plp ring, which should have sp2 hybridization. in
contrast, in the internal aldimine of the rcshmt,
the -nh- of the active site lysine residue is out of
ê on the si face
this extended plane by about 0.35 a
0
of c4 . the green-yellow color of the eshmt ternary complex crystals is consistent with an aldimine
structure and not a quinonoid (structures iii and ii,
scheme 1). the carboxylate group of the glycine
residue forms a tight ion pair with arga363,
resembling the ion pair formed in aat in the
closed form of its substrate analogue complex. one
oxygen atom of the glycine carboxylate group can
also hydrogen bond to the side-chain of sera35
and tyrb65 and the other to the imidazole group
of hisa203.
the carbon atom of the formyl group covalently
bound to the n5 of the pteridine ring is out of the
plane of the ring, and on the same side as the
hydrogen at c6. this indicates that n5 has sp3
hybridization and that the formyl group does not
exist as an enolate with a double bond to n5. the
oxygen atom of the formyl group is oriented away
from the o4 atom of the pteridine ring as predicted
ê from the
(stover & schirch, 1991) and is 3.3 a
nitrogen atom of the glycine aldimine. the carbon
ê from the ca
atom of the formyl group is 3.75 a
atom of the glycine, from which we infer that the
formaldehyde product of the plp-catalyzed half
reaction must migrate to react with the n5 of the
 xxxd3334xxx  molecule.
the oxygen atom of the formyl group also

makes hydrogen-bond length interactions (2.71 a
ê ) with the carboxylate group of glub57,
and 2.90 a

implying that this carboxylate group is protonated.
this inference is further strengthened by the interactions of a presumed water molecule immobilized
at this site in three of the four subunits of the
eshmt tetramer. this water molecule hydrogen

of the carboxylate oxygen atoms of glub57

hisa126, which is stacked on the plp ring.
a hydrogen bond network extending through the
side-chains of thra224 and asna102 to hisa126 is
consistent with protonation of ne2 of hisa126,
further con®rming our assignment of a proton to
the glub57 side-chain. this side-chain is shielded
from solvent, although not buried, and in the
rcshmt makes no hydrogen bond interactions
with other groups, supporting its protonation. the
interactions of groups at the active site of eshmt
and their distances are summarized in figure 7.
mechanistic implications
the structure of the ternary complex described
here provides a basis for understanding the inhibition of shmt by 5-formyl- xxxd3334xxx  and some
clues to the as yet incompletely validated mechanism of this enzyme. the effects of both 5-formylh4pteglun and 5-methyl-h4pteglun on several
steps of shmt-catalyzed reactions with different
substrates have been studied with rabbit cytosolic,
e. coli and pig heart enzymes. folate-independent
cleavage of l-serine substrate is competitively
inhibited (ki  0.2-0.5 mm) by 5-formyl-h4pteglun,
but with a dependence on the length of the polyglutamate tail. for n  1 monoglutamates, the inhibition is immediate, but for n  3 polyglutamates it
is slow (stover & schirch, 1991), possibly indicating additional reaction steps associated with interactions of the extended polyglutamate tail.
the structure of this ternary complex provides a
basis for understanding the inhibition of the serine
cleavage step. if the glycine substrate of the 5-formyl- xxxd3334xxx  glycine ternary complex is substituted by serine in the crystallographic model, the
orientation of the serine side-chain is considerably
constrained by the formyl substituent, whose position overlaps the site of serine side-chain binding
and will exclude this substrate. this constraint is
likely to be the basis for the competitive inhibition

aldimine would compromise these binding interactions of glycine in the absence of compensating
changes in protein structure. it is possible that the
plp in shmt does not undergo the same changes
that have been inferred in the mechanism of aat.
it appears from this ternary complex structure
that the carboxylate side-chain of glu57 in the
active site is protonated. this may be due to its
hydrogen bond to the formyl oxygen atom of the
5-formyl- xxxd3334xxx  and/or to its sequestered
location in the structure. we do not know the protonation state of this carboxylate in the unliganded
rcshmt structure, but it forms no hydrogen bonds
to protein groups and there is no immobilized solvent within hydrogen-bonding distance. the other
oxygen atom of the glu57 carboxylate group in the
ternary complex makes a hydrogen bond to a nearby water molecule from which it must be a proton
ê from the protonated
acceptor, and is only 3.44 a
-n10h- of the folate to which the methylene group
of the reaction product is linked. glu57 seems
likely to play an important role in the mechanism
of shmt catalysis, but in the known crystal structures it appears to be in its acid form and not the
conjugate base.

observed. the dependence of the rate of inhibition
on the length of the poly(glu) tail is consistent
with our observation of a change in conformation
of the poly(glu) binding loci of shmt distal from
the active site. binding at this site by the longer
polyglutamate tail is likely to stabilize the inhibitor
complex in a manner reciprocal to the movement
induced by amino acid substrate binding, which
positions the distal polyglutamate binding site for
interaction with the cofactor.
the structure of this ternary complex raises two
questions likely to be important in understanding
the mechanism of shmt catalysis. one is the
changes in orientation of the plp ring during the
course of the reaction and the other is the protonation state and role of the glu57 carboxylate sidechain at the active site. although we do not have
the structure of the internal aldimine of e. coli
shmt for comparison, on the assumption that it is
identical with that of the hc and rcshmt internal
aldimine, the external aldimine observed in this
ternary complex forms without the expected
rotation of up to 30  of the plp ring observed for
aat. it is possible that the 5-formyl- xxxd3334xxx 
obstructs the rotation of the plp ring, but arguing
against that is the observed correct stereochemistry
of the glycine external aldimine linkage and the
favorable interactions of the glycine substrate with
groups in the active site. further rotation of the
plp ring away from its position in the internal

materials and methods
structure determination
monoclinic crystals (p21) of the e. coli ternary complex
were obtained from 2 m potassium phosphate at ph 7.2
as described by stover et al. (1993) and listed by
kazanina et al. (1998). intensity data were collected at
room temperature on an raxis ii image plate detector
with a rotating anode source run at 80 kv and 100 ma
with a detector to crystal distance of 95 mm. oscillation
data were integrated with denzo and merged with scalepack (otwinowski & minor, 1997). merged intensity
data were converted to structure factor amplitudes using
truncate (collaborative computational project number
4, 1994). data collection statistics are summarized in
table 3. the large value of rmerge is due to the inclusion
of all data with intensity > ÿ 3s and to the fact that a
small fraction of the measured intensities were contaminated by adherent satellite crystals that could not be
completely separated mechanically. although both density measurements (kazanina, et al., 1998) and vm calculations were consistent with six molecules in the
asymmetric unit, the absence of non-trivial solutions in a
threefold self-rotation search coupled with the presence
of only two non-trivial solutions in a twofold selfrotation search led us to conclude that the asymmetric
unit consisted of two identical dimers.
a  xxxd2428xxx  chain based on residues 27-380 of a
monomer from the re®ned structure of rabbit cytosolic
ê resolution (pdb entry 1cj0) was used as
shmt at 2.8 a
a search model for molecular replacement. in constructing this model, residues corresponding to insertions in
the e. coli sequence were deleted and the  xxxd2428xxx 
chain religated using the electron density map based on
the rabbit cytosolic structure (scarsdale et. al., 1999) as a
guide. a cross-rotation search was carried out using data
ê and 4 a

col (delano & brunger, 1995; tong & rossman, 1997) as
implemented in cns version 0.5b (brunger et al., 1998).

the solutions corresponding to the 12 highest peaks
from the cross rotation-search were used as input into a
translation search (fujinaga & read, 1997; navaza &
vernoslova, 1995) as implemented in cns 0.5b. the
remaining three molecules in the asymmetric unit were
individually placed via translation searches based on the
initial molecular replacement solution using the peaks
from the self-rotation function as input with previously
placed molecules held ®xed during the searches. after
each translation search, the positions and orientations of
all molecules were re®ned independently via rigid body
ê
re®nement. the resulting phases were extended to 3.2 a
by ten cycles of cyclic averaging about both the intradimer and inter-dimer dyads using the program dm
from the ccp4 suite. these phases were used to calculate a 2fo ÿ fc map which was visualized using the program o (jones & kjeldgaard, 1997). this map was
readily interpretable, permitting side-chains to be placed
for many residues and clearly showing the plp cofactor,
which had been omitted from the molecular replacement
searches. the initial rwork for this model was 48 % and
dropped to 39 % after one cycle of re®nement.
the model was iteratively re®ned via torsion angle
dynamics and a maximum likelihood target function
(pannu & read, 1996) using cns 0.5b with each re®nement cycle followed by manual rebuilding in o using
2mfo ÿ dfc cross-validated sigmaa weighted maps
(read, 1986). non-crystallographic symmetry was

for smooth re®nement of b-factors. during iterative
rebuilding, residue geometries and interactions were
monitored with the programs oops (kleywegt & jones,
1996) and whatcheck (hooft et al., 1996). in the ®nal
cycles of re®nement, 397 solvent molecules were added
based on the presence of peaks with intensity  xxxd1571xxx  in a
sigmaa weighted difference map and the presence of

protein hydrogen bond acceptors/donors within 3.3 a
of the water oxygen atom. coordinate errors in the
re®ned structure were estimated using cruickshank's
diffraction data precision indicator as implemented in
the sfcheck program (vaguine et al., 1999). re®nement statistics are summarized in table 3.
comparison of the eaat structure was completed
both by manual superposition and also with compar3d
(shinyalov & bourne, 1998). comparison of the monomer structures of rcshmt and the eshmt ternary complex were made by an initial manual superposition of
the two monomer backbones. non-corresponding residues in each of these coordinate ®les were edited out

center for structural biology at yale university, new
