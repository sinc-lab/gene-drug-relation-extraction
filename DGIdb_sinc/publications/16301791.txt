non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as potent inhibitors of  xxxg1759xxx : structure of the complex of  xxxg1759xxx  with  xxxd2723xxx  at ...  phospholipase a(2) (pla(2);  xxxg766xxx   xxxg1192xxx   xxxg1611xxx   xxxg1613xxx   xxxg1721xxx .4) catalyzes the first step of the production of proinflammatory compounds collectively known as eicosanoids. the binding of phospholipid substrates to pla(2) occurs through a well formed hydrophobic channel. surface plasmon resonance studies have shown that  xxxd2723xxx  binds to naja naja sagittifera pla(2) with an affinity that corresponds to a dissociation constant (k(d)) of 4.3 x 10(-5) m. binding studies of pla(2) with  xxxd2723xxx  were also carried out using a standard pla(2) kit that gave an approximate binding constant, k(i), of 1.26 +/- 0.05 x 10(-6) m. therefore, in order to establish the viability of pla(2) as a potential target molecule for drug design against inflammation, arthritis and rheumatism, the three-dimensional structure of the complex of pla(2) with the known anti-inflammatory agent  xxxd2723xxx  [2-[3-(trifluoromethyl)anilino] xxxd2715xxx ] has been determined at 2.5 angstroms resolution. the structure of the complex has been refined to an r factor of 0.187. the structure determination reveals the presence of one  xxxd2723xxx  molecule at the substrate-binding site of pla(2). it shows that  xxxd2723xxx  interacts with the important active-site residues his48 and asp49 through two water molecules. it is observed that the  xxxd2723xxx  molecule is completely buried in the substrate-binding hydrophobic channel. the conformations of the binding site in pla(2) as well as that of  xxxd2723xxx  are not altered upon binding. however, the orientation of the side chain of trp19, which is located at the entry of the substrate-binding site, has changed from that found in the native pla(2), indicating its familiar role.
