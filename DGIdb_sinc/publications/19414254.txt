we determined the 2.35-å crystal structure of a human  xxxd1409xxx  catalytic subunit (referred to as ck2a complexed with the atp-competitive, potent  xxxd1409xxx  inhibitor  xxxd1979xxx . the inhibitor binds to ck2a with a
novel binding mode, including water-mediated hydrogen bonds. this structural information may support
discovery of potent  xxxd1409xxx  inhibitors.

 xxxd1979xxx 

 xxxg535xxx  (former name: casein kinase 2) is a highly
conserved serine/threonine protein kinase, and >300 protein substrates of  xxxd1409xxx  have been identiﬁed.1 the  xxxd1409xxx  holoenzyme comprises two catalytic and two regulatory subunits.2 ck2a as
catalytic subunit is constitutively active with or without the regulatory subunit referred to as ck2b.3
 xxxd1409xxx  has important roles in the growth, proliferation, and survival of cells. it is expressed in a wide variety of tumors.4 downregulation of  xxxd1409xxx  in tumor cell lines leads to cell death because  xxxd1409xxx 
suppresses apoptosis in tumor cells.5 we recently reported that
 xxxd1409xxx  was a target protein for glomerulonephritis (gn) therapy, supported by experiments showing that administration of antisense
oligodeoxynucleotide against  xxxd1409xxx  or low-molecular-weight ck2speciﬁc inhibitors effectively prevented progression of renal disease in a rat model of gn.6
several planar chemical compounds have been identiﬁed as
atp-competitive and selective  xxxd1409xxx  inhibitors, such as  xxxd1979xxx ,7
 xxxd1986xxx ,8 apigenin,9 tbb,10 iqa,11 and drb12 (fig. 1).  xxxd1979xxx 
(4,40 ,5,50 ,6,60 -hexahydroxydiphenic acid 2,6,20 ,60 - xxxd1800xxx ), a naturally occurring tannic-acid derivative, was ﬁrst identiﬁed as a
novel potent  xxxd1409xxx  inhibitor using a virtual screening approach
(ki = 0.02 lm).7  xxxd1979xxx  selectively inhibits the catalytic activity of  xxxd1409xxx  (ic50 = 0.04 lm) compared with other kinases such as

pka (ic50 = 2 lm) or pkc (ic50 = 8 lm).7 trials to produce potent
and selective  xxxd1409xxx  inhibitors are in progress.13,14
for stimulating drug discovery, the structures of human ck2a
complexed with three atp site-directed inhibitors, including emodin8 (protein data bank (pdb) code:  xxxd1986xxx  and 3c13), drb15 (pdb
code:  xxxd1871xxx ), and  xxxd604xxx  (fig. 2; 50 -adenylyl-beta, gamma-imidodiphosphate)16,17 (pdb code: 1pjk and 2pvr) have been reported.
among them,  xxxd1986xxx  and drb bind to ck2a with unique binding
modes in the atp-binding site. as well as  xxxd1986xxx  and drb as natural compounds,  xxxd1979xxx  was expected to bind to ck2a with
another novel binding mode. this would contribute to the development of  xxxd1409xxx  inhibitors.
the crystal structure at 2.35 å shows that  xxxd1979xxx  binds to
ck2a in the atp-binding region (fig. 3),18 although the relatively
broad electron density map corresponding to the inhibitor suggests
mere disorder of the inhibitor molecule. this binding mode is different to the one analyzed using computational methods by cozza
et al.7  xxxd1979xxx  has no immediate interaction with the hinge region (glu114 to asn118) by which the n-terminal lobe and c-terminal lobe are connected. this is despite the fact that interaction of
atp, gtp and many atp-competitive inhibitors in the hinge region
is a dominant factor in binding to ck2a, and that docking simulation showed that  xxxd1979xxx  made immediate interaction with the
hinge region.
in this complex, four water molecules (w1, w2, w3, w4) independently act as a bridge between ck2a and  xxxd1979xxx . the latter
interacts with the hinge region, and this is mediated by w1 and

w2 (fig. 4). this water-mediated interaction makes prediction of
the binding mode difﬁcult because several kinase inhibitors form
immediate hydrogen bonds at the hinge region. w1 forms hydrogen bonds with one of the hydroxyl groups of  xxxd1979xxx  (2.5 å),
the carboxyl oxygen atom in the backbone of glu114 (3.3 å) and
the nitrogen atom in the backbone of val116 (3.3 å). superimposition of  xxxd604xxx  onto the  xxxd1979xxx –ck2a complex reveals that
the position of w1 in the  xxxd1979xxx –ck2a complex ﬁts the n1
atom in the purine moiety of  xxxd604xxx , in which the n atom forms
an immediate hydrogen bond with the nitrogen atom in the back-

implicated in nucleotide binding. the c-terminal lobe is mainly a-helical and serves
as a docking site for substrates.  xxxd1979xxx  binds in the atp-binding region near the
hinge region, which unites both lobes.

bone of val116 in the hinge region (fig. 5). the remained water w1
in the ellagic-ck2a complex reminds the fact that a potent inhibitor binds to  xxxg62xxx  leaving the water molecule at
the binding site of the n1 atom in substrate adenosine.19 this positional compatibility suggests that unique inhibitors possessing this
water-mediated interaction may be produced via structure-based
drug discovery or virtual screening. resulting compounds are likely
to have selectivity to ck2a over other kinases.

the boundary between the atp-binding pocket and the solventaccessible region.

acid–ck2a complex. n1 in the purine frame of  xxxd604xxx  ﬁts the w1 water molecule.

the carbonyl oxygen atom of arg47 in the glycine-rich loop (a
highly conserved region among protein kinases with high ﬂexibility) interacts with  xxxd1979xxx , and this interaction is mediated by
w3 (fig. 6). w3 forms two hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of arg47 (2.8 å) and a carbonyl oxygen of  xxxd1979xxx  (2.6 å).
this interaction allows the glycine-rich loop to restrict conformational ﬂexibility as judged by a density map corresponding to the
loop (fig. 6).
w4 tethers  xxxd1979xxx  to ck2a at his160. compared with other
human ck2a structures including  xxxd1986xxx -,8 drb-,15 and  xxxd604xxx -16,17 complexes, the side chain of his160 is remarkably close
to  xxxd1979xxx ; this interaction (hydrogen bond or oh–p interaction) is mediated by w4. this observation is supported by density
maps corresponding to his160 (fig. 6). this induced ﬁt may help to
stabilize this complex structure.
other than these water-mediated interactions, immediate
hydrogen bonds and van der waals interactions are observed in
binding between  xxxd1979xxx  and ck2a.  xxxd1979xxx  forms a hydrogen bond with an active residue lys68 (2.5 å; fig. 7). lys68 is
essential for enzyme activity, and binds to the a- and b-phosphate
of atp.  xxxd1979xxx  interacts with asp175 (3.1 å), which is also
essential for enzyme activity (fig. 7). the latter unique interaction
is not observed in the predicted complex by computational analysis.7 protonated  xxxd1979xxx  may form a hydrogen bond or p–p
interaction with asp175, even though x-ray analysis did not reveal
if  xxxd1979xxx  is protonated.

ile95, phe113, his160, met163 and ile174 surround  xxxd1979xxx .

the condensed planar structure comprising four ﬂat rings in  xxxd1979xxx  would effectively gain enthalpy from the van der waals
contacts with many hydrophobic residues, including val53, val66,
ile95, phe113, his160, met163 and ile174, in the atp-binding region of ck2a (fig. 8). the smaller atp-binding site of ck2a due
to bulky residues should allow high selectivity for other kinases
such as pka and pkc (table. 1). the rigid conformation of ellagic
acid possibly confers a small entropic penalty in binding to ck2a.
in conclusion, we determined the crystal structure of human
ck2a complexed with  xxxd1979xxx , providing structural insight
for potential drug discovery. first,  xxxd1979xxx  forms several
water-mediated or immediate hydrogen bonds with the participation of w1, w2, w3, w4, glu114, val116, asn118, arg47, his160
and lys68. these hydrogen bonds allow  xxxd1979xxx  to bind to
ck2a strongly and selectively.  xxxd1979xxx  has a speciﬁc interaction
with his160 compared with the other human  xxxd1409xxx –inhibitor complexes. second, the highly ﬂat and hydrophobic character of ellagic
acid is advantageous in the van der waals interactions at the
smaller atp-binding site comprising many hydrophobic residues,
including val53, val66, ile95, phe113, his160, met163 and
ile174. these structural insights would be highly beneﬁcial for
developing novel and potent  xxxd1409xxx  inhibitors.

18. the c-terminal truncated form of human ck2a was cloned into the pgex6p-1
expression vector (ge health care) and expressed in escherichia coli as a gstfused protein at the n-terminus. e. coli strain hms174 (de3) cells carrying
pgex/ck2a were cultured in lb medium supplemented with ampicillin at
310 k. expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mm iptg when the
absorbance 600 nm reached 0.5, and cultivation was continued for 21 h at
298 k. the cells were harvested, resuspended in the buffer, and sonicated. after
removing the cellular debris by centrifugation, the supernatant was puriﬁed by
the afﬁnity chromatography with a gstrap hp column and anion-exchange
chromatography with a monoq column (ge-healthcare). the puriﬁed protein
was concentrated to 10 mg/ml. an excess amount of powdered  xxxd1979xxx  was
suspended in the protein solution. the centrifuged supernatant was used for
crystallization as a protein solution. crystallization trials were performed using
a crystal screening kit crystal screen ht (hampton research) by the sittingdrop vapour-diffusion method. well formed crystals of the ck2a- xxxd1979xxx 
complex were obtained under the optimized condition including 25% ethylene
glycol as a precipitant. after dipping into paratone-n oil (hampton research),
the crystals were frozen using a nitrogen gas stream at 100 k. a diffraction data
set was collected on bl6a beam line at the photon factory. the data were
processed with the program hkl-200020. molecular-replacement calculations
were carried out with the program molrep21 in the ccp4 suite.22 all
reﬁnements and electron-density map calculations were performed using the
programs ds modelling and cnx (accelrys). final reﬁnement was converged to
r = 22.19%, rfree = 27.41%. the pdb accession code is  xxxd1979xxx .
