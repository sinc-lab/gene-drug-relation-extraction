it is now

25 years since the establishment of 'y- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba)

as an inhibitory neurotransmitter within the mammalian brain (see refs.

although the presence of this neutral amino acid within the brain had been

described more than

10 years earlier (3, 4), its role as a neurotransmitter was
5, 6) . while it produced profound depressant actions

disputed at that time (e. g.

on central neurones, the nature of this effect was not considered to be
consistent with synaptic inhibition

(7). only after kmjevic' & schwartz (8)

equated synaptically mediated inhibition with the inhibitory action of gaba
on the same cerebral cortex neurones was the transmitter role considered to

be a reality. during the subsequent years much evidence was provided to
support a synaptic role but perhaps the discovery in
receptor antagonist, bicuculline, by curtis

1970 of the competitive
& colleagues (9) was the most

crucial. this alkaloid was observed to be a selective antagonist of both the

fast actions of gaba and synaptic inhibition in higher centers. within the
spinal cord much synaptic inhibition is mediated by the amino acid glycine
through receptors that are insensitive to bicuculline. this insensitivity perhaps

helped to explain why the determination of gaba as a ens-inhibitory
transmitter was such a problem, since many studies attempting to discover

the natural transmitter were performed on neurones in the spinal cord where

glycine is of major importance.

bicuculline is now used routinely to define gaba-mediated processes

where receptors are coupled to chloride conductance mechanisms in neuronal

receptors can be prevented by this antagonist.

in 1979, my colleague and i were performing experiments to establish the

presence of gaba receptors on peripheral nerve terminals

of our experiments we used bicuculline but it failed to prevent the action of
gaba. this observation led us to the introduction of a novel receptor for
gaba, the  xxxg828xxx . this review considers the significance of

gabab receptors in mammals.
the receptors are not confined to the periphery but are clearly functional
within the central nervous system from where most data have emerged. some
comparisons with gabaa receptor mechanisms are made although much
more is known about the gabaa receptor, including the receptor sequence
from molecular biology studies (see ref.
obtained thus far for gabab sites.

11) . no such information has been

history
as outlined above, it was while trying to establish the presence of receptors
for gaba on peripheral nerve terminals that gabab sites emerged. the

purpose of the original experiments was to establish a peripheral model for

receptors mediating synaptic inhibition. the existence of presynaptic inhibi­

tion had been known for many years and there was very good evidence that
the inhibition was mediated by gaba. gaba neurones, present in the dorsal
hom of the spinal cord, appear to form axo-axonic contacts with terminals of

primary afferent fibers

(12, 13) . activation of the receptors on these terminals

decreases transmitter release to modulate the output of the sensory process.

gaba released from the spinal intemeurones is believed to depolarize (rather
than hyperpolarize) the nerve terminal and the release evoked by nerve volleys
would then be diminished (see ref.

14). we and others (15-17) had shown

that gaba also depolarized peripheral sympathetic neurones and considered
that if this effect was manifest on the terminals of ganglionic neurones as well

as on the soma then the sympathetic system might form an effective model
for presynaptic events in the spinal cord. since it was not possible to record
the electrical event in the nerve terminals, it was decided to measure the
output of neurotransmitter instead. the rat isolated atrium was chosen for the
study since much information was available on the release and uptake of the

sympathetic neurotransmitter noradrenaline, using tritium-labeled material as
a tracer

(18). gaba decreased the transmurally stimulated release of
in a dose-dependent manner, as predicted (10, 19). how­

ever, the action was insensitive to bicuculline and other recognized gaba

antagonists such as  xxxd2947xxx , and established gaba receptor agonists, such
as isoguvacine and  xxxd2792xxx , were inactive. this inhibition of 3h-noradrenaline

release could be observed equally in other peripheral tissues such as the rat

anococcygeus. an illustration of this is shown in figure

1 where the gaba

analogue,  xxxd278xxx  (see later), depressed the evoked release of transmitter and

the twitch response in a dose-dependent manner. the response seemed not to
be mediated through an increase in cl- conductance and therefore depolar­

ization and presynaptic inhibition, we had illustrated an inhibition of trans­
mitter release by gaba that was not associated with membrane depolarization
and was not via the familiar receptor.
after obtaining these data and characterizing the pharmacological profile
of this, apparently novel, receptor ( 19), we used brain tissue to establish
whether the receptor is present in the brain and not just an artefact within the
periphery. we demonstrated that k + evoked release of radiolabeled noradren­
aline from brain slices could be inhibited by gaba and this inhibition was
not blocked by bicuculline (20) . moreover, the gab a analogues that were
inactive in the peripheral model were also inactive in brain-slice release
experiments . ultimately, we developed a radiolabeled receptor binding assay
in brain synaptic membranes that enabled us to distinguish two recognition
sites for gaba with entirely separate profiles (21) . at this point we introduced
the terms "gabaa and "gabab" as there seemed little doubt that separate
receptors exist.
agonists
our early studies soon demonstrated that many accepted gaba mimetics at
bicuculline-sensitive receptors (gabaa sites) were inactive at gabab sites,
but at that stage only one compound had the reverse profile, i.e. active at
gabab sites but inactive at gabaa. this compound, �-p-chlorophenyl­
gaba or  xxxd278xxx , had been synthesized and marketed as an antispastic agent
some 10 years earlier (22, 23) . it has been designed as a brain penetrating
form of gaba that, it was hoped, would mimic the action of gaba probably
after enzymic degradation. in fact, no evidence could be obtained to support
either the gab a mimetic action or its degradation. it is known that  xxxd278xxx 
is excreted largely unchanged by the kidney (24) . nevertheless, it is
therapeutically active and remains a major treatment for spasticity by virtue
of action within the brain to which it gains access by a selective transport
process (25) .  xxxd278xxx  is virtually inactive at gabaa sites but is stereospe­
cifically active at gabab sites , (- ) xxxd278xxx  being the active form. a number
of close-related analogues of  xxxd278xxx  and gaba have been shown to be
agonists of gabab sites (figure 2). the most potent so far described are the
phosphinic analogues 3-aminopropyl phosphinic acid and its methyl analogue,
but although they exhibit 10--100 fold higher affinity for the gabab, binding
site than (- ) xxxd278xxx  this affinity is not maintained in all functional assays
(26---30) .
the apparent inconsistency between the activities of the ligands in the
binding and functional assays has invited consideration of heterogeneity within
the gab ab receptor population . surprisingly , however, it was not this
discrepancy but rather the electrophysiological data that first led to the idea

of receptor heterogeneity . although the evidence is very slender, it neverthe­
less warrants discussion and has therefore been included towards the end of
the chapter.
only a limited number of active gabab agonists have so far been
described, a reflection possibly of the narrow limits within which the structure
can apparently deviate from gaba. numerous predictions have been made
based on the structure and the possible conformational state of  xxxd278xxx  but
these have produced either inactive or only weakly active ligands. for
example, mann & colleagues (31) predicted that 1-(aminomethyl)-5-chloro2, 3-dihydro-1h-indene-i-acetic acid would be an optimal mimic of the

solid-state conformation of  xxxd278xxx . surprisingly, this compound was com­
pletely inactive.
any substitution so far reported at the (a or "i positions in gaba or the
phosphinic acid analogues markedly reduces agonist activity and affinity for
the gabab site (32) whereas substitution at the 13 position, of course, may
not. thus, the p-chlorophenyl ( xxxd278xxx ), hydroxy, or chloro analogues all
retain appreciable activity (19) . substitution on the amino group always
produces a significant loss of affinity (32) . however, this does not appear to
be the same for antagonists (see below) .
antagonists
s elective antagonists for the gabaa receptor complex have been known for
many years and include compounds such as bicuculline,  xxxd2947xxx , and the
bicyclophosphates (9, 33, 34) . these compounds all act to decrease cl- -me­
diated inhibition evoked by activation of the gabaa receptor even though
their mechanisms of action may differ. for example, bicuculline is a
competitive antagonist, whereas  xxxd2947xxx  acts noncompetitively to prevent
gabaa channel activation. the resulting decrease in neuronal ci- conduc­
tance produces convulsant activity with all of the antagonists.
none of these compounds has any effect on gab ab receptor mechanisms,
a finding that, in part, provided the initial suggestion for a separate receptor.
it was only some years later that the first selective gabab antagonists
emerged. the first substances to be reported, 8-aminovaleric acid and
3-aminopropane sulphonic acid (3aps) (35, 36) , w ere not selective ligands.
although they exhibit weak  xxxg828xxx  antagonism they are also
effective gabaa agonists (3aps is at least as active as gab a at gabaa
sites) and therefore cannot be used as tools to dissect out gabab -mediated
events . however, the activity of 3aps provided a clue that kerr and
colleagues eventually pursued to produce the selective antagonist saclofen and
its 2-hydroxy derivative (37) . prior to this , these same authors , inspired by
the success of watkins (38) who showed that w-phosphono analogues of
glutamate are antagonists of nmda receptors , produced the phosphonic
derivative of  xxxd278xxx , phaclofen (39) . phaclofen was the first, albeit weak,
selective gabab antagonist.
the affinity of phaclofen for gabab binding sites in rat brain synaptic
m embranes is in excess of l oo[lm (cf gab a and ( - ) xxxd278xxx  �50-80nm).
when extrapolated to more functional assays this affinity m eans that concen­
trations in the region of imm are necessary to achieve sufficient receptor
occupation to antagonize responses to the agonist. this was accomplished to
good effect in hippocampal slices where data obtained w ith phac10fen provided
the first evidence for a physiological role for gabab, receptors in mammalian

brain. dutar& nicoll (40) showed that phaclofen could prevent the production
of late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (ipsps) in hippocampal pyramidal
cells in response to orthodromic stimulation of the stratum radiatum. similar
effects have now been demonstrated in other brain regions (e.g. 41-43) using
phaclofen and the more potent derivatives saclofen and 2-hydroxy saclofen
(44; figure 3) . t hese compounds are approximately tenfold more potent than
phaclofen but, like the phosphonic derivative, do not readily penetrate the
blood brain barrier. since such high concentrations are required in the vicinity
of the  xxxg828xxx  to obtain antagonism coupled with the poor brain
penetration, systemic administration of these antagonists will not produce any
changes in brain  xxxg828xxx  activation. thus, although these compounds
have provided much information in isolated preparations the introduction of
a brain-penetrating antagonist has long been awaited .
cgp 35348 (figure 3), the first compound i n this class to be reported, acts
competitively but has only low potency (45, 46) . in binding studies its affinity
for gabab sites in brain synaptic membranes is in the region of 35f.1m (cf
(-) xxxd278xxx  �50nm and 3appa-l onm). thus, to achieve any receptor
antagonism in vivo large amounts must be injected systemically. using
30-100mg/kg lp . or 1o-30mg/kg lv. , olpe and colleagues (46) showed clear
antagonism of responses to  xxxd278xxx  applied iontophoretic ally onto rat
cerebrocortical neurones. the effect was selective and produced no change
in the responses to certain other neuroactive agonists. perhaps most im­
portantly the antagonist produced no behavioral changes itself, which would
suggest that  xxxg828xxx  mechanisms are not subjected to a major
endogenous activation under resting (physiological?) conditions. this lack of
effect augurs well for possible future therapeutic use since adverse side effects
may be limited. b y comparison, gabaa antagonists produced profound
effects following acute systemic administration, particularly convulsive activ­
ity. clearly, gabaa receptors are constantly being activated and any
interference in this activation places an imbalance in the system to produce
excessive neuronal excitation. cgp 35348 has been used in numerous studies
where gabab mechanisms have been indicated and these applications are
discussed below.
the most recent brain-penetrating antagonist to be introduced is cgp 36742
(figures 1, 3) , which appears to have greater potency in vivo than cgp 35348
and is brain available even after oral administration. the affinity of this
compound for gabab binding sites is 35f.1m (h. bittiger, personal commu­
nication) and like cgp 35348 can block the effects of  xxxd278xxx  while
producing no obvious effects in the absence of exogenous agonist. future
studies with this compound should prove exciting, particularly in relation to
any therapeutic potential.

have been described by debaert and colleagues (47, 48; figure 3) but while
they may or may not gain access to the brain, only relatively low potency has
been noted. a series of thioether analogues of saclofen and phaclofen have
also been examined, but in all cases they were less active than the parent
compounds on isolated preparations (49) . perhaps the most exciting antago­
nists reported so far have been by froestl et al (32) . these authors have
described results obtained with novel gabab antagonists with nanomolar
affinity for the receptor. by substitution with a monochloro- or dichlorobenzyl
moiety on the nitrogen of the antagonist cgp 35348, affinity for the gabab
binding increased from 35f.1m to iflm and 55nm respectively . further
substitution on the 13 carbon with methyl or hydroxyl groups increased the
affinity still further (32). these observations are in striking contrast to those
obtained with agonists where substitution on the nitrogen in all cases
diminishes activity at the  xxxg828xxx .
location of gabab sites
in mammals gabab sites occur outside as well as inside the brain and, not
surprisingly, are present in lower species too . for example, they have been
described in the lobster at the neuromuscular synapse on both inhibitory and
excitatory axon terminals where they appear to be coupled to k+ channels via
g-protein (50). giant intemeurones of the cockroach ens also possess gaba
receptors with characteristics reminiscent of the gabab subtype , although
the pharmacological characteristics are not exactly the same (51). in achatina
juiica, neuronal responses to gaba and  xxxd278xxx  have been described that
were attributed to  xxxg828xxx  activation, although the data were
inconclusive (52).
the locations of  xxxg828xxx  sites in mammals have been ascertained
from functional as well as receptor autoradiography studies. in general , they
are not confined to neurones but are also present on glial cells (53). outside
the brain, gabab receptors have been described on axon terminals and
ganglion cell bodies of the autonomic nervous system (e .g. 19, 54) , on
fallopian tube and uterine and intestinal smooth muscle cells ( 55-58) , in the
kidney cortex (59), urinary bladder muscle (60), and on testicular interstitial
cells (61; table 1) . within the brain , an uneven distribution of receptors occurs
with regional variations in receptor density; receptor autoradiography has
provided much of the evidence for this regional heterogeneity (62-64) . in
many brain regions gabab and gabaa sites exist together, but in certain
areas gabab sites have been demonstrated with very few gabaa receptors
being present. for example, in the interpeduncular nucleus the density of
gabab sites is high whereas that of gabaa sites is extremely low (62). b y
contrast, gabab sites appear to be absent from the cerebellar granule cell
layer whereas high affinity gabaa sites are in abundance (65). high densities

of gabab sites also occur in the cerebral cortex and certain thalamic nuclei
and these latter sites may be of therapeutic significance in the treatment of
absence seizures (see below) . moderate densities of gabab sites are present
throughout the hippocampal formation although are low in the pyramidal cell
layer. the presence of these sites in this brain region may be significant in
cognitive functioning since it has been proposed that the induction of long-term
potentiation is influenced by  xxxg828xxx  activation/antagonism ( 66-68,
but see also 69). the globus pallidus , habenula nucleus, superior colliculu s ,
and amygdala also contain moderate t o high densities o f gabab sites, but
their possible significance in these regions has yet to be demonstrated. in
many regions the primary location of gabab sites appears to be presynaptic
in origin. in the rat caudate putamen, for example, the density of gabab
sites is reduced following chronic decortication (70), which suggests a location
on corticostriatal terminals. also following electrolytic ablation of the
habenula, gabab site binding virtually disappears from the interpeduncular
nucleus , which again indicates a presynaptic location on terminals of the
retroflexus of meynert that terminate in the nucleus (71). a further indication
of a presynaptic location for gabab sites occurs in the cerebellum where it
has been suggested that they are located on parallel fibre terminals in the
molecular layer (72). this does not exclude the possibility of a postsynaptic
location on purkinje cell dendrites as well (73). a dual location may also
occur elsewhere, for example, in the rat spinal cord, where gabab sites

predominate in the dorsal hom, denervation of primary afferents either by
surgery or capsaicin injection in the neonate produced a 50% reduction in the
density of gabab sites (74) . while the remaining sites may also be
presynaptic in origin on terminals of intemeurones or descending fibers , they
may also be present at postsynaptic sites within the spinal cord . the
significance of gabab sites in the spinal cord in relation to spasticity and
analgesia is discussed below .
within the hippocampus gabab sites also occur at pre- and postsynaptic
sites. electrophysiological data indicate their presence at both sites. dutar&
nicoll (75) reported that the hyperpolarizing response to bacl ofen in cal
pyramidal cells as well as the synaptically evoked late ipsp was antagonized
by phaclofen and by g-protein adp ribosylation with pertussis toxin. by
contrast, the attenuation of evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (epsps)
by  xxxd278xxx  in the same region was unaffected by either agent. harrison (76)
has produced similar data that suggest the possibility that not only are gabab
sites at these separate locations but that they may also be distinct forms of
the receptor differentially linked to g-proteins at each site. similar conclusions
have derived from studies in the dorsal raphe n ucleus (77) , corpus striatum
(78), and cerebral cortex (79) .
the presence of presynaptic rather than postsynaptic receptors within the
pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus could explain data we have recently
obtained using tetanus toxin. this endotoxin produced by clostridium tetani
selectively suppresses the release of inhibitory transmitter, e. g. gaba from
nerve terminals (80, 81). perhaps as a consequence, injection of the toxin
into the cal region produced neurodegeneration with a loss of n eurones in
close proximity to the injection site some 7-10 days later (82, 83). a
concomi tant reduction in gabaa receptor binding also occurred in the same
region and probably reflects the loss of neurones, which are presumed to be
pyramidal cells possessing the binding sites on their s urface. in complete
contrast, gabab binding in the pyramidal cell layer was completely
unaffected by the toxin or subsequent loss of neurones. this result may
indicate that the binding is restricted to nerve terminals within this hippocam­
pal layer. the most obvious site would be thc gabaergic nerve terminals of
gabaergic basket intemeurones, which innervate the pyramidal cells. these
terminals might be unaffected by the toxin and thus gabab binding occurs
to the same extent as normal at autoreceptor sites. this hypothesis is supported
by earlier evidence from newberry & nicoll (84) that electrophysiological
responses to  xxxg828xxx  activation can be readily detected on the
dendrites of pyramidal cells, but not on the cell soma. by contrast, the
sensitivity to gabab agonists appeared to be constant over the soma and
dendrites. data from receptor autoradiography studies from normal hippocam­
pus (62) have shown that gabab sites are unevenly distributed across

evenly distributed across the dendrites and soma.
information on the distribution of gabab sites in mammalian brain derives
primarily from studies using rat tissue. however, these data compare favorably
with those obtained so far in post mortem primate brain (table 2). it is
particularly worth noting that the distribution within the human spinal cord
appears to be very similar to that in the rat despite the lack of well-documented
evidence that  xxxd278xxx  acts as an analgesic in man (85. 86).

initial observations of  xxxg828xxx  stimulation in neurones of peripheral
origin, i . e. dorsal root ganglion cells and myenteric neurones, indicated that
the primary effect of receptor activation was a diminution in membrane ca+ +
conductance. this effect was manifest as a decrease in the duration of action

potentials i n c and ab neurones o f dorsal root ganglia (87, 88) and a reduction
in the amplitude of ca ++ spikes elicited in myenteric neurones in vitro (89) .
that a decrease in ca ++ conductance occurs in ganglion cells was supported
by subsequent voltage clamp s tudies in cat, mouse, and rat neurones (90-92) .
such an effect on voltage-gated ca ++ channels would readily explain the
original neurochemical evidence that  xxxd278xxx  and gab a can diminish the
evoked release of neurotransmitters (19, 20) . a diminution in ca ++ flux
would provide an obvious explanation.
however, evidence solely for a ca ++ mechanism has not been established
within the brain, where changes in k+ conductance may be more important.
+
giihwiler& brown (93) found no evidence for a direct involvement of ca +
channels in the response to  xxxg828xxx  activation in hippocampal slices.
their conclusion was that any changes in ca ++ conductance result from an
initial increase in k+ conductance. but there seems to be scope for implicating
a decrease in ca ++ conductance in the mechanisms of presynaptic inhibition
even within the hippocampus . scholtz & miller (94) have recently indicated
that the calcium current responsible for mediating presynaptic inhibition in
cultured hippocampal neurones is modulated by gabab receptors .
studies on dorsal root ganglia (drg) have provided important information
on possible ca+ + channel involvement. holz et al (95) demonstrated with
chick drg cultures that pertussis toxin reduces the effect of gaba on action
potential duration; this finding indicates a g-protein connection in the process.
 xxxg828xxx  activation appears to mediate a decrease in ca ++ conduc­
tance through a direct link with g-proteins (96).
gaba receptors have been considered to affect a variety of vol tage-gated
ca ++ channels in central and dorsal root ganglion neurones . much evidence
supports an association with "n" channels, although an effect on "l" channels
has also been suggested (97) . however, in studies using ca ++ flux measure­
ments in rat cerebral cortex synaptosomes with the fluorescence indicator quin
++
2,  xxxg828xxx  activation diminished the voltage-dependent ca
signal
in an additive manner with the l-channel antagonist nifedipine (98) . similarly,
 xxxd278xxx  and nifedipine were additive in inhibiting the influx of ca ++ into
cerebellar granule cells (99) . this additivity might suggest an action for
gabab agonists independent of l-channels. surprisingly, thalman &
ai-dahan (100) observed a marked decrease in gabab binding to brain
synaptic membranes in the presence of an l-channel antagonist, but it seems
unlikely that this reflects an affinity for l-channels.
+
the third type of ca + current, "t", may also be implicated in the response
to  xxxg828xxx  activation . this low threshold transient current can be
influenced by  xxxd278xxx  in a manner dependent on the agonist concentration
(101) .

irrespective of a direct or indirect action, is undoubtedly of major significance
in the pathophysiology of this receptor system. whether a direct mechanism
can be implicated in the control of transmitter release has yet to be established.
however, such a mechanism seems most likely at primary afferent fibers in
the spinal cord where  xxxg828xxx  activation decreases the evoked release
of putative neurotransmitter peptides such as  xxxg2240xxx . even in higher
centers where preliminary evidence indicates that gabab sites on excitatory
nerve terminals are linked to k + channels, the possibility of implicating ca ++
channel s at inhibitory nerve terminals remains (b . h. giihwiler & s . m .
thomson, personal communication) .
gabab-mediated inhibition of voltage-gated ca++ currents has been
observed in a variety of neuronal types and is not confined to sensory ganglia.
in goldfish retinal ganglion cells under whole-cell patch clamp, ( - ) xxxd278xxx 
and gaba inhibited calcium currents activated by prolonged depolarization.
however, phaclofen and 2-hydroxy saclofen failed to prevent the inhibition
(102). in bovine chromaffin cells, ( - ) xxxd278xxx  inhibited ca ++ signals in a
pertussis-sensitive manner (103) and in freshly dissociated spinal cord
neurones from the rat,  xxxd278xxx  inhibited the voltage-sensitive ca++ current
in a substantial fraction of cells. this effect appeared to be mediated via
g-proteins (104) . inhibition of voltage-gated ca ++ channels in cultured spinal
neurones has also been described by kamatchi& ticku (105). however, in
these experiments ca++ activated 86rb efflux was used as the marker. only
the vol tage-sensitive ca ++ activated 86rb efflux was inhibited by  xxxd278xxx 
+
whereas that produced by the ca + ionophore , a23187, was not.
+

k

channels

within higher centers of the mammalian brain an increase in k+ channel
conductance appears to be the primary neuronal response to gabab activation
and produces membrane hyperpolarization . this response has been described
in numerous brain regions including the hippocampus cerebral cortex,
thalamus, septum, and medulla (e.g. 40, 42, 84, 93, 106-112) . this
hyperpolarization appears to reflect the late inhibitory postsynaptic potential
demonstrated in these regions after afferent fiber stimulation. the late ipsp
and  xxxd278xxx -induced hyperpolarization can be antagonized by phaclofen and
c gp35348 and both events can be prevented by prior treatment with pertussis
toxin. injection of pertussis toxin into the rat lateral ventricle, 3 days prior to
preparing hippocampal slices, prevented the hyperpolarization produced by
 xxxd278xxx  as well as the evoked late ipsp (113, 114) . the fast ipsp mediated
via gabaa receptors through an increase in cl- conductance was unaffected.
this result would support the notion that gabab but not gabaa receptors

are linked through g-protein(s) to k + channels. whether the same g-pro­
+
tein(s) is/are responsible for coupling k and ca ++ channels is unknown but
certainly both are of the gi/go class since both mechanisms are prevented by
adp ribosylation.
the question of which k + channel(s) is (arc) responsible for mediating the
response to  xxxd278xxx  has been recently reviewed by gage ( 115) .
current indications are that an a current may be responsible. this current
is voltage-sensitive and is virtually inactivated at normal resting membrane
potential . gabas receptors appear to potentiate this current (116) and since
these are present on presynaptic terminals they may be responsible for
+
modifying transmitter release rather than any direct effect on ca + channels.
since activation of the a current was not prevented by pertussis toxin and the
reported presynaptic effects of  xxxg828xxx  activation also appear to be
pertussis toxin-insensitive in rat hippocampus, the receptor may be coupl�d
directly to k + channels in these terminals. this would contrast w ith the
postsynaptic k + channels where activation is mediated through g-protein and
second messengers (117).
the postsynaptic k + channel(s) modulated by  xxxd278xxx  in hippocampal
neurones has been reported to be affected by numerous substances; these
include the local anaesthetic qx-314, which appears to have no effect on cl­
channels associated with gabaa receptors (118, 119) , and  xxxd3068xxx 
and kainic acid (120) . in isolated substantia nigra neurones, gabab receptors
have been reported to activate what appears to be an atp-regulated k+
channel since the sulphonylurea,  xxxd3394xxx , blocked the h yperpolarization
and increase in whole-cell conductance produced by  xxxd278xxx  (121) .
the inhibitory effect produced by increasing membrane k + conductance
on postsynaptic dendrites may be of even greater significance than the
generally accepted influence of ci- conductance mechanism . qian &
s eynowski (122) predict that for inhibitory synapses to be effective on cortical
spines "they should be mediated by k + through gabab receptors". the
traditionally held belief is that the profound hyperpolarization produced by
gabaa receptor activation is faster and of greater magnitude. perhaps the
full potential of gabab mechanisms has yet to emerge.
presynaptic receptors
undoubtedly, gabab receptors on presynaptic terminals can have a major
pharmacological influence on synaptic processing. as pointed out above,
w ithin the hippocampus  xxxd278xxx  can depress epsps consistent with an action
on terminals of schaffer collaterals in the ca l region (see ref. 123). this
h eteroreceptor effect can also be detected in mouse hippocampal neurone

cultures, where epsps in one neurone are produced by stimulation of another
neurone ( 124), as well as in hippocampal slices (75, 125) . suppression of
the evoked release of glutamate appears to be the mechanism responsible
for these observations. however, little evidence exists to support a physi­
ological role for this phenomenon and, in fact, morrisett et al (126) have
concluded that, while the gabab system constitutes a powerful mechanism
for control of a major excitatory system in hippocampal pyramidal cells,
no evidence exists for gabab-mediated presynaptic inhibition of excitatory
transmitter release.
the presynaptic effect on glutamate release is not confined to the hippo­
campus b ut has been demonstrated in other brain regions; these include
neurones of nucleus accumbens (127) and terminals of corticostriatal fibers
in rat neostriatum (78) where the  xxxg828xxx  may differ in its
characteristics from the postsynaptic receptor (e .g. 76, 78) . however, much
of the evidence for this separation stems from an insensitivity to the antagonist
phaclofen, which is a very weak antagonist even at the postsynaptic receptor.
interestingly, phaclofen completely blocks the inhibition of glutamate-evoked
acetylcholine release produced by opioids in rat neostriatal slices (128) . this
action might reflect the presence of a pre- or postsynaptic  xxxg828xxx .
 xxxg828xxx -mediated inhibition of neurotransmitter release is manifest
in a variety of systems, including those releasing catecholamines and serotonin
(20, 129-133), peptides (134-137) , and acetylcholine (see ref. 138; table 3).
in all cases, with the exception of  xxxg2240xxx  release in the spinal cord (137),
there is little reason to believe that the effects are of physiological importance.
however, by contrast, gabab-mediated inhibition of endogenous gaba
release may be functional. the presence of gabab autoreceptors in mam­
malian brain tissue has been well established by the use of neurochemical
techniques (139-141) and they appear to be more abundant than presynaptic
gabaa receptors. it has been suggested that these gabab autoreceptors
may differ from presynaptic gabab sites on glutamate and somatostatin-con­
taining nerve terminals (136) such that receptor subtypes may exist.
waldmeier and colleagues (140, 142) cast doubt on the importance of
gabab autoreceptors. firstly, they demonstrated that inhibition of gaba
release occurs at low rather than high stiit'..ulation frequencies, whereas the
firing rate of gaba neurones is normally expected to be high. secondly,
 xxxg828xxx  antagonism by cgp 35348 failed to modify the k+ -evoked
output of gaba within the rat striatum when measured in vivo by using a
microdialysis technique (142) . although the experimental system may be
inappropriate , the evidence suggests that gabab autoreceptors may play little
part in the physiological control of gab a release, at least in the corpus
striatum.

despite this lack of neurochemical support for an endogenous control
mechanism, other evidence points to presynaptic autoreceptor control. mott
et al (143) have demonstrated in the rat dentate gyrus that the reduction in
recurrent inhibition produced by tetanic stimulation of mossy fibers can be
reversed by phaclofen. their data are consistent with the idea that gaba is
released during tetanic stimulation and acts on gabab sites located on
inhibitory intemeurones to reduce recurrent inhibition. the presence of
gabab receptors on such terminals is also supported by paired-pulse studies
performed in hippocampal slices recorded from ca l neurones (for example,
see ref. 66).
stimulation of afferent fibers in close proximity to the ca l neurones in
rapid succession normally produces a reduction in the second evoked response,
depending on the interval between stimuli. this reduction can be decreased
by gabab antagonists, a result that has prompted davies et al ( 144) and
mott& lewis (68) to propose that gabab mechanisms are influential in the
genesis of long-term potentiation (ltp). this phenomenon, which is consid­
ered to be functional in learning mechanisms, is produced after periods of
high frequency stimulus trains to depolarize the postsynaptic cells. excitatory

amino acid receptor activation, notably of the nmda receptor, has been
implicated in this process and  xxxg828xxx  activation may act as a
modulation system. however, the nature of this participation appears to
depend on the stimulus employed. at a frequency in the region of 5hz,
gabab antagonists suppress the formation of ltp, which, it is suggested,
stems from a loss of the disinhibition produced by activation of gabab
receptors on inhibitory terminals (68, 144) . however, at higher frequencies
of stimulation (100hz) the reverse occurs (69) and gabab antagonists
facilitate the production of ltp. the significance of this distinction has yet
to be determined.
receptor heterogeneity
electrophysiological studies on the presynaptic and postsynaptic gabab
mechanisms suggest that the receptors at these locations may differ. in the
hippocampus presynaptic gabab responses appear to be insensitive to
phaclofen and pertussis toxin (75, 76, 78) , whereas postsynaptic responses
are prevented by both agents . in neocortical slices the hyperpolarizing action
is not mimicked by 3-aminopropyl phosphinic acid (145), and deisz et al (79)
have suggested that gabab receptors located on gab a-releasing terminals
are pharmacologically distinct from postsynaptic gabab sites and moreover,
unlike the postsynaptic site, are not coupled to a k + conductance mechanism.
b y contrast, seabrook et al (28) have indicated that the presynaptic gabab
site in caudate putamen on glutamate terminals and the postsynaptic receptor
on neurones of the substantia nigra pars compacta are pharmacologically
indistinguishable. the similarities in agonist potencies and antagonist affinities
did not permit any separation. in addition, thomson & gahwiler ( 146)
recently claimed that the pre- and postsynaptic receptors studied in area ca3
of hippocampal sli ce cultures are also the same. this finding appears to be
in direct contrast to the data of calabresi et al ( 78) obtained in s lices of rat
neostriatum. could this disparity stem from differences between cultured
neurones and slice preparations? perhaps future experiments will clarify the
issue.
neurochemical release studies have not, so far, helped to establish a
distinction between pre- and postsynaptic receptors. release studies by raiteri
and colleagues (136) have suggested a possible distinction between receptors
on different presynaptic terminals, but whether all or any of these differ from
the postsynaptic recognition site has not been considered. in s tudies using the
k +-evoked release of endogenous glutamate from slices and synaptosomes
prepared from rat brain cortex, we have observed that 3-aminophosphinic acid
(3apa) does not mimic the inhibitory action of gaba and  xxxd278xxx  even
though it is a potent gabab agonist (147) . the s ame conclusion w as also

noted by dolphin et al (96) in cerebellar granule cells . however, seabrook
et al (28) have demonstrated that 3apa is a partial agonist at glutamate
terminals in the corpus striatum and ong et al ( 148) indicate that 3apa mimics
the presynaptic action of  xxxd278xxx  in hippocampal neurones in culture.

receptor heterogeneity: second messenger
studies
an alternative basis for receptor heterogeneity may derive from studies on
second messenger responses to  xxxg828xxx  activation . it is well
established that gabab receptors are coupled via g-proteins to adenylyl-cy­
clase (72, 149, 150-156), although the association of g-proteins may not be
absolute (157) and may fluctuate during development (158) . essentially, when
gabab receptors are activated in cerebrocortical slices an inhibition of basal
or  xxxd1742xxx -induced camp formation or potentiation of l3-adrenoceptor (or
vasoactive intestinal pepti de)-stimulated camp accumulation occurs. it has
been suggested that these two systems may be pharmacologically distinct since
certain gabab agonists and antagonists fail to mimic or antagonize (- )bac­
l ofen in both assays (159, 160). in particular, cgp 35348 is only a very weak
antagonist of the inhibitory effect of  xxxd278xxx  even though it does antagonize
the potentiation of noradrenaline-induced camp formation at l ower concen­
trations. however, the data are inconclusive and the distinctions insufficient
to allow a separation to be made thus far.
much evidence has been produced to indicate a coupling of gabab sites
with adenylyl cyclase through gtp-protein regulation sites (114, 152, 154,
161, 162) but other bi ochemical events have also been attributed to gabab
receptor activation. for example, weak stimulation of phosphotidyl inositol
(pi) turnover in dorsal root ganglia (96) and enhancement of the turnover
induced by nmda in neonatal rat cerebellar slices (163) or noradrenaline in
cerebral cortex slices (164, 165) have been reported. however, inhibition of
the stimulation in pi turnover induced by 5ht and histamine has also been
demonstrated (166, 167) although the effects are small and may be species­
dependent.
it has also been reported that transmitter-associated enzymes can be affected
by  xxxg828xxx  activation . systemically administered  xxxd278xxx  facilitates
5ht synthesis in vivo in the rat corpus striatum ( 168) and also stimulates
dopamine synthesis in the same organ (169). surprisingly, gabar receptor
activation has also been reported to inhibit  xxxg2276xxx  activity in
rat corpus striatum (170) , which would be expected to reduce rather than
increase the catecholamine level .
whether any of these biochemical changes plays a major role in gabab
receptor-mediated events is unclear. do they participate in any of the

spinal cord
in an attempt to answer this question, we (171) have recently studied the
gabab-mediated changes in camp levels produced in rat spinal cord, in
relation to the known antinociceptive effect of gabab agonists. this
analgesic effect is believed to be mediated through an action, at least in part,
within the spinal cord, possibly through inhibition of the release of primary
afferent transmitters such as  xxxg2240xxx .
we have observed that (- ) xxxd278xxx  (o. i-100flm edso 4flm) can dose-de­
pendently inhibit (up to 100%) the release of  xxxg2240xxx  from rat isolated
spinal cord evoked by electrical stimulation of dorsal roots. by contrast,
(+ ) xxxd278xxx  produced less than 30% inhibition at 500flm (137; figure 4) .
the accumulation of camp produced by  xxxd1742xxx  in spinal cord slices was
inhibited by  xxxg828xxx  agonists (171) . however, the [3-adrenoceptor­
stimulated accumulation of camp was not potentiated by  xxxg828xxx 
activation. the oabab receptor antagonist, cop 35348, at doses up to

1. 5mm failed to prevent the inhibition in  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp accu­
mulation produced by (- ) xxxd278xxx  and gaba. since cgp 35348 can prevent
the antinociceptive action of  xxxd278xxx  in rodents (172) , we concluded that the
changes in camp accumulation produced by  xxxg828xxx  activation are
unrelated to the antinociceptive response. presumably the decrease in release
of primary afferent transmitter produced, perhaps, by a decrease in ca+ + flux
( 173) operates independently of changes in adenylyl cyclase activity .
b aclofen appears to have a primary action on terminals of afferent fibers
within the spinal cord. while the highest density of receptors appears to be
on small diameter fibers (74), there is also evidence for their presence on
monosynaptic ia afferents (174, 175) and perhaps to a lesser extent on
descending fiber terminals (175) . it seems plausible that the receptors on small
diameter fibers mediate the antinociceptive response to  xxxd278xxx  and that those
on large diameter fibers mediate the therapeutic muscle relaxant effect. both
effects are antagonized by gabab antagonists (172, 176) . however, it is
also feasible that the effects are mediated additionally through other sites. for
example, stefanski et al (177) have suggested that muscle relaxation may also
be produced via the nucleus accumbens septi since local injection of  xxxd278xxx 
(1 and 2. 4j..lg) into the brain region of the rat dose-dependently decreased
muscle tone. turski et al ( 178) have also indicated that supraspinal regions
may be involved in muscle relaxation and have implicated the substantia pars
reticulata as a possible site .

general effects attributed to gabab
receptor activation
numerous side effects have been attributed to  xxxg828xxx  activation in
mammals as outlined in an earlier review (179) and summarized in table 4.
in the light of these actions, it is perhaps surprising that ( - ) xxxd278xxx  does not
normally produce multiple side effects when administered to patients. one
reason may be that the majority of the reported effects in animals appear to
derive from an action within the cns and since there is normally only limited
brain penetration of  xxxd278xxx , the levels achieved are possibly insufficient to
produce such effects. in fact, in certain patients the levels obtained in higher
centers produce adverse effects at or below the therapeutic threshold dose in
spasticity. this has prompted the introduction of intrathecal infusion systems
to reduce the incidence of side effects while obtaining the required muscle
relaxation (180-187) . this site-directed application of the gabab agonist is
fast becoming a standard mode of administration, producing remarkable
therapeutic results with few side effects.

for more potent gabab agonists, the periphery may prove to be an equally
important location. it has been proposed, for example, that a gabab agonist

may b e a useful antiasthma drug since  xxxg828xxx  activation within the
bronchioles decreases the release of acetylcholine and  xxxg2240xxx  (135, 188) ,
which normally increase airways resistance, and also decreases bronchiole
hyperreactivity (138) , which is a feature of asthma. this contrasts with the
action of gabaa agonists, which do not affect hyperreactivity . a potent and
more aqueous soluble gabab ligand may prove to be therapeutically effective.
gabab agonists also decrease intestinal motility ( 189, 190) and this
property may be an important indication for their use in overactive states
without the side effects associated, for example , with muscarinic receptor
antagonism.
one potentially significant ens application may be the antinociceptive
action referred to earlier. however, evidence for b aclofen as an analgesic in
man is lacking despite the unequivocal evidence for antinociceptive activity
in rodents (85, 86, 172, 191-196) . this effect in rodents appears to be
mediated via g-protein coupled gabab receptors since pertussis toxin as
well as  xxxg828xxx  antagonism can prevent the action of  xxxd278xxx  ( 172,
197, 1 98) . although the locus of this effect resides in the spinal cord ( 1 91 ) ,
a supraspinal site o f action may also contribute (86).
in humans, the trigeminal nucleus may be an important focus for the action
of  xxxd278xxx  since trigeminal neuralgia has been successfully treated with
(- ) xxxd278xxx  ( 199-201) . the mechanism underlying this analgesic effect is
unclear but gabab receptors are certainly implicated.
antagonists
indications for the potential use of gabab antagonists are far greater than
for the agonists , assuming that the actions produced by  xxxd278xxx  are mimicking
endogenous responses to  xxxg828xxx  activation under physiological or
pathological conditions . even if only a limited number of the reported effects
(table 4) are relevant, the potential benefits of antagonists are high. i t can
be predicted that an antagonist will exhibit antiepileptic, antidepressant,
nootropic, anxiolytic, and neuroprotective properties. however, the evidence
for these effects with the exception of epilepsy is slender. predicting a
neuroprotective effect with a gabab antagonist seems an unlikely proposition
at first sight. if gabab agonists suppress the release of glutamate (202, 203) ,
which is considered to be a neurotoxin contributing to the production of
neuronal damage in ischaemia (204), an agonist rather than an antagonist,
might be expected to be neuroprotective. however,  xxxd278xxx  has been s hown
to be ineffective in the four-vessel occlusion model of cerebral ischemia in
rats (205) and in global ischemia produced by carotid occlusion in mongolian
gerbils (r. gill & n. bowery , unpublished observations). it was also
ineffective against nmda-induced neurotoxicity in the rat corpus striatum
(206) .

focal injection of tetanus toxin, which suppresses the synaptic release of
gaba (e.g. 80) , induces neuronal degeneration in the vicinity of the site of
injection and this can be prevented by nmda receptor antagonists or ablation
of excitatory afferents (207, 208) . if the toxicity is due to an imbalance
between gaba and glutamate then gaba agonists acting through gabaa
receptors may be neuroprotective. if gabab autoreceptor activation depresses
gaba release (139) from gabaergic terminals then an autoreceptor antag­
onist should increase the overflow and the synaptic concentration. this
antagonism might provide a novel basis for neuroprotective activity.
a similar argument could be made for the potential anxiolytic activity of
a gabab antagonist. if the synaptic release of gaba is increased to produce
a greater response to gabaa receptors, gabaergic transmission could be
enhanced in a manner synonymous with the action of benzodiazepines or the
barbiturates .
the possibility o f cognitive improvement stems from the observations of
dlpe & karlsson (69) that gabab antagonists can facilitate long-term
potentiation in hippocampal slices when provoked by high frequency stimulus
trains . schwartzwelder et al (209) also reported that  xxxd278xxx  can decrease
memory acquisition and retention in rats. presumably an antagonist might
have the opposite effect, although no information is available at present. (see
note in proof, page 147)
the basis for the potential antidepressant effect of a gabab antagonist
derives from evidence obtained in gabab and (3-adrenoceptor binding
experiments after prolonged treatment with gabab antagonists. chronic
administration (i.p.) of the brain penetrating gabab antagonists, cgp 35348
and cgr 36742 for 21 days produced a significant down-regulation in
(3-adrenoceptor eh-iodopindolol) binding in rat frontal cortex (210; g. pratt
& n . g. bowery, unpublished observations) . the effect was comparable with
that produced by administration of desipramine (p .o. or i . p . ) over the same
time period. gabab binding was also upregulated in the same brain region,
although the effect was only statistically significant following administration
of cgp 36742.
chronic administration of antidepressant drugs upregulates gabab binding
in the rat frontal cortex and hippocampus (21 1 , 2 1 2) although this finding has
been disputed by others (e . g . refs . 2 13 , 214). nevertheless, lloyd et al (2 1 5)
have reported that olfactory bulbectomy in rats , a model of depression,
produces a decrease in gabab binding in frontal cortex that can be reversed
by antidepressant administration. carbamazepine and lithium have also been
reported to upregulate gabab binding in rat hippocampus following chronic
treatment (216) .
in relation to these findings , it has been reported that  xxxg828xxx 
agonists may be beneficial in the treatment of clinical depression (217 -220) .

however, this conclusion has not been supported by other groups (e. g. 221,
222, 223, 224) . in fact , an increase in depression was even apparent following
(- ) xxxd278xxx  treatment in the study by post et al (224) .
although no definitive evidence supports an antidepressant action with
gabab antagonists , the observed reduction in l3-adrenoceptor binding and
possible antagonism of the reduction in release of transmitter amines by
gabab agonists (20, 133) may provide a basis for further investigation.
the possible significance of gabab receptors in convulsive epilepsy has
been the focus of attention in many laboratories. in general ,  xxxd278xxx  has been
reported to exert both anticonvulsant and proconvulsant activity, depending
upon the model employed and the dose administered (225-237).
in humans ,  xxxg828xxx  activation may induce seizure-like activity
under certain circumstances, particularly after withdrawal (234, 238), but the
incidence of such adverse reaction appears to be rare even in epileptic patients
(239) .
it has recently been suggested that gabab mechanisms may be more
important in nonconvulsive epilepsy or absence syndrome. absence epilepsy
appears to be of thalamocortical origin and manifests in humans as an abrupt
decrease in motor activity without loss of consciousness. a variety of animal
models for this syndrome exist, including the lethargic mouse (240) , the
strasbourg genetic absence rat (241) , and -y-hydroxybutyrate-induced syn­
'
drome in rats (242) . in each of these models a spike and wave discharge
consistent with that observed during absence syndrome in humans can be
detected.  xxxg828xxx  antagonism can suppress this discharge in all
cases (240, 243, 244). moreover, -y-hydroxybutyrate appears to act as a
gabab agonist at the high concentrations required to produce the syndrome
in rats (245; r. b ernasconi , personal communication, ). even though other
classes of drugs can reduce the spontaneous absence activity , marescaux et
al (243) suggest that  xxxg828xxx  mechanisms are responsible for the
genesis of the syndrome. however, the underlying mechanism(s) have yet
to be discovered. the syndrome does not appear to result from an
up-regulation of gabab receptors since no evidence could be demonstrated
in a receptor autoradiography study of brain sections obtained from these
rats (246).
crunelli & leresche (247) have suggested that the electrophysiological
events resulting from stimulation of afferents to the thalamus may provide
clues to the underlying mechanism. these authors have demonstrated that the
late ipsp recorded from thalamic neurones in response to optic tract stimulation
can produce ca+ + spikes . these, they suggest, result from de-inactivation of
"t" currents produced by the prolonged gabab mediated hyperpolarization.
interestingly, marescaux et al (243) indicate that suppression of the sponta­
neous spike and wave discharge in rats is only produced by gabab

antagonists injected systemically or directly at lower doses into specific
thalamic regions. discrete injections elsewhere in the brain produced no
reduction in the pattern of discharges .
at present, only data from animal models are available and it remains to
be seen whether gabab antagonism proves to be effective in the human
syndrome. however, the results obtained thus far make their potential
application in humans an exciting prospect.
receptor structure
unlike the gabaa receptor no information is currently available about the
structural sequence of gabab receptors . however, it seems a reasonable
assumption that the sequence will have greater homology with other g-protein
linked receptors than with the 4 subunit pentameric structure of the gabaa
receptor. expression of the  xxxg828xxx (s) has been obtained in xenopus
oocytes using mrna obtained from rat cerebral cortex (248) and cerebellum
(249, 250) . in the former experiments the expressed receptors mediated an
increase in ci- conductance and a decrease in k+ conductance, which
contrasts with the native receptor mechanism(s) . presumably, the g-protein
coupling associates the receptor with available channels that are not neces­
sarily those expressed under normal conditions in mammals. taniyama et al
(249, 250) have used mrna obtained from cerebellum to express gabab
sites in xenopus oocytes. the channel coupling in their experiments was more
consistent with the native mechanisms such that an increase in k + conductance
was observed on receptor activation. however, only 5% of injected oocytes
appeared to express the receptor-operated channel , suggesting that perhaps
the g-protein coupling mechanism may limit functional expression in these
cells . it would be interesting to know whether the expression rate for the
uncoupled receptor binding site is greater.
kuriyama and colleagues (251-253) have attempted to obtain a purified
form of the  xxxg828xxx  from bovine brain using  xxxd278xxx  as an affinity
ligand.  xxxd278xxx  was coupled to the aliphatic epoxy group of sepharose 6b
and receptor protein, solubilized from brain membranes , was applied to an
affinity column containing the coupled ligand. a partially purified preparation
of the  xxxg828xxx  was obtained and a monoclonal antibody raised against
it. subsequent experiments with the antibody indicate a protein of about 80
kd. incubation of the antibody with crude synaptic membrane overnight at
3
4°c reduced h-gaba binding to the membrane pellet in a dose-dependent
manner (253) .
monoclonal antibodies have also been raised against ( - ) xxxd278xxx  conju­
gated with glutaraldehyde to hemocyanin (254) . these have been used on
brain tissue obtained from rats and monkeys previously injected with b aclofen

to localize the ligand bound to its receptors . overall the distribution of
antibody binding was similar to that obtained by receptor autoradiography. it
would be interesting to obtain an antibody to the  xxxd278xxx  antibody that might
provide a selective receptor marker. however, the monoclonal antibody
produced by martinelli et al (254) appears to recognize the p-chlorophenyl
moiety of  xxxd278xxx . if this moiety does not form part of the molecule that
binds to the recognition site then the anti-antibody may be of little value.
since gaba and 3-aminopropyl phosphinic acid are receptor ligands which
do not contain a chlorophenyl moiety, the anti-antibody approach may be
invalid.
undoubtedly the sequence of the  xxxg828xxx  will emerge in the near
future to join the ranks of the receptor families already known. whether or
not this sequence will be homogeneous and homologous with other receptors
is an important question since this may provide the basis for receptor
heterogeneity, as suggested in functional receptor studies .
functional homology with other receptor types is clear, not least with

summary
in conclusion, gabab receptors appear to be of major importance in synaptic
processing within the brain and are present at both post- and presynaptic sites .
their activation can hyperpolarize neurones and diminish neurotransmitter
release from presynaptic terminals. we already know that drugs , i.e.  xxxd278xxx ,
that mimic this activation are therapeutically useful, although the full
significance of their use both inside and outside the brain has yet to be realized.
drugs that interfere with  xxxg828xxx  activation should also prove to
be important therapeutic agents. a number of suggestions have been proposed
but it will be many years before the potential effects can be consolidated or
refuted in humans. only now are brain-penetrating gabab antagonists being
discovered , due largely to the expertise of the research group at ciba-geigy,
basel . the emergence of such compounds makes future studies an exciting
prospect. in particular, the discovery that gabab antagonism can suppress
absence seizures in rats has provided an important therapeutic target.
it is now just over ten years since we first designated the term gabab.
since then a wcalth of information has been obtained, but perhaps thc best is
still to come.
