specific

[ 14c]warfarin binding. microsomes of warfarin-sensitive rats contained about 40 pmole of specific binding
sites per mg of microsomal protein. there was no difference for r- or s-[“‘c]warfarin. neither was
there any difference between the enantiomers of  xxxd59xxx  and  xxxd2911xxx  to prevent the in
vitro racemic [‘%i]warfarin binding. pretreatment of the microsomes with dithiothreitol, the in vitro
reductor for microsomal  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase activity, reduced the warfarin binding. vitamin
k epoxide nor  xxxd3522xxx  affected the warfarin binding. microsomes of the welsh warfarin resistant
genotype showed weak warfarin binding properties. the scottish resistant variant, on the other hand,
did not differ from sensitive microsomes. warfarin binding was reduced in microsomes of rats to which
 xxxd990xxx  was administered. the reduction in warfarin binding was linear with the inhibition of
microsomal  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase activity and was linear with the amount of  xxxd990xxx  present
in the microsomes. the results show the microsomal 4-hydroxycoumarin binding to be related to the
target enzyme  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase.

along several experimental
lines it has become clear
that liver tissue contains one or more saturable bind-

ing sites for 4-hydroxycoumarin oral anticoagulants.
pharmacokinetic
analysis of the plasma warfarin
elimination in hepatectomized rats led cove11 et al.
[l] to assume a hepatic warfarin binder with a capacity of 2.7 pgg/ml liver tissue and a kd of 1.5 ng/ml.
in our laboratory scatchard analysis of in uivo steady
state tissue levels of the s-enantiomer
of  xxxd59xxx  in rat livers showed a single hepatic binding site: b,, about 4 nmol/g liver tissue, kd about
7 nm [2]. this binder was felt to be responsible for
the typical dose dependent pharmacokinetic behavior of the 4-hydroxycoumarins in rats.
thierry et al. [3] were the first to report on
[ 14c]warfarin liver distribution in rats and they found
a 1%  xxxd1835xxx  insoluble precipitate enriched
in ribosomes to contain a warfarin binder. later,
lorusso and suttie [4] and searcy et al. [5] showed
that the warfarin binding protein stemmed from the
endoplasmatic reticulum and that it was reduced in
warfarin-resistant rats. these results suggested the
microsomal binding protein to be related to the, at
that time unknown, 4-hydroxycoumarin receptor.
today, it is believed that the 4-hydroxycoumarin
anticoagulants exert their activity by blocking the
(vitamin ko)
enzyme  xxxd3522xxx  2,3-epoxide
reductase. the enzyme is part of the so-called  xxxd3522xxx  cycle which resides in the endoplasmatic
reticulum of the hepatocyte and of other tissue
cells [6,7]. in in vitro assays the enzyme needs a
dithiol (dithiothreitol, dtt) to function and from
activity assays in the presence of thiol blockers it
is proposed the enzyme to contain two active site
sulfhydryl groups which become oxidized during substrate reduction
[8,9]. dtt is needed for reacti* to whom correspondence

should be addressed.

vation, i.e. reduction of the enzyme. an alternative
model suggests the dithiol to function as a substrate
[lo]. the mechanism of interaction of the 4-hydroxycoumarins with vitamin ko reductase is unknown,
except for the recognition that (a) the interaction
probably only occurs with the oxidized (inactive)
enzyme; or in the absence of the dithiol substrate
[lo, 111; (b) the interation is very tight, i.e. the
coumarin drug does not dissociate from its binding
site [12, 131 unless the enzyme is converted to its
active form either by reduction of the disulfide or by
binding of the dithiol substrate [14,15]. the reactivation, however, is hampered due to the bound
coumarin derivative.
from in uiuo hepatic distribution studies of microdoses of radio-labeled warfarin and the effect of the
in viva administration
of unlabeled 4-hydroxycoumarins thereupon, we recently hypothetized the
hepatic 4-hydroxycoumarin binder (see above) and
the target enzyme vitamin ko reductase to be one
and the same [15].
in order to get futher evidence for this we investigated the in uitro microsomal warfarin binding in
rat livers at various conditions. the results are
reported in the present paper.
materials and methods

racemic
[ 14c]warfarin
(46 mci/mmol)
was
obtained from amersham co. (the netherlands).
r-/s-[ 14c]warfarin were isolated according to the
procedure of banfield and rowland [16] with
some modifications;
n-t-boc- xxxd2434xxx 
(sigma
chemical co., st louis, mo) was used instead of
n-cbz- xxxd2434xxx  because the diastereoisomers of
the former showed a more favorable chromatographic behavior on tlc (silicagel tlc plate with

ing phase: petroleum ether, ethylacetate. methanol;
75, 25. i; v,v,v). the enantiomers of warfarin and
 xxxd59xxx  were prepared according to the procedure of west et al. [ 171. the enantiomers of  xxxd2911xxx  were a gift of hoffman la roche (basel,
switzerland).
rat (male wistar, 270-300g) liver microsomes
were prepared as follows: under light ether anesthesia blood was withdrawn via the abdominal aorta.
the liver was perfused in sifu with ice-cold saline via
the portal vein. the liver was excized, rinsed and
after mincing in three times its volume of ice-coid
0.02 m tris-hc1 buffer ph 7.4. containing 0.25 m
sucrose and 0.15 m kc1 by a blender, it was homogenized
(potter-elvehjem
technique).
all
subsequent manipulations
were performed in the
cold. microsomes were pelleted from the 10,ooog
homogenate
supernatant
by centrifugation
at
loo,ooog,60 min. the microsomes were washed by
resuspending them in the original volume of buffer
( xxxd3449xxx  without sucrose) followed by the centrifugation step. the wash step was repeated with a
0.02 m  xxxd3449xxx  containing 1 m nacl. finally, the
microsomes were resuspended in the latter buffer
to contain about 15 mg protein per ml microsomal
suspension. the microsomes were stored at -70”.
microsomal protein was assayed by the lowry
method.
warfarin binding to microsomes was assayed as
follows: the microsomal suspension was diluted 5fold in 0.02 m tris-hcl buffer ph 7.4. of this mixture 0.5 ml was pipetted in two rows of polycarbonate
reaction vessels, one of which contained 20 pg (about
0.66 ,umole) unlabeled racemic warfarin. the reaction mixtures were incubated for 3 min at 30” whereafter [ 14c]warfarin was added in increasing amounts,
i.e. 3 x 103-lo5 dpm. after 10 min incubation
(shaking waterbath), 2ml ice-cold  xxxd3449xxx  was
added and the reaction mixture was filtered immediately over a mi~liporer ha filter, pore size 0.45 pm,
using a milliporer 1225 sampling manifold. the filters were rinsed with an additional 2 ml of ice-cold
buffer and after suction to dryness they were brought
into counting vials containing 10 ml of liquid scintillation cocktail (formulat 989, du pont). the
bound warfarin was obtained by subtracting the
counts recovered of the mixtures containing the unlabeled warfarin (blanks) from those without warfarin
(samples). the amount of unbound, free exchangeable, warfarin was obtained by subtracting the counts
of the samples from the counts initially added. the
binding experiments were performed in duplo. the
relationship bound vs. unbound was analyzed by
a non-lin curve fitting program (crispr, crunch
software co, san francisco, ca) assuming one binding site.
microsomal vitamin ko reductase activity was
assayed as described previously [14]. microsomal
warfarin content was assayed by hplc procedure
[18]results

to retain microsomes by filtration, pore widths
less than 1 pm were needed. control filtrations with

binding data were obtained by subtracting blanks
(see materials and methods) filter adsorption was
not corrected for. figure 1 shows a plot of microsomal bound racemic [14c]warfarin vs its free
concentration. the plot suggests saturable warfarin
binding which is also apparent from a scatchard plot
(fig. 1). data analysis of this typical experiment,
assuming one binding site showed a total binding
capacity of 35 pmote (standard error 3%) of racemic
warfarin per mg of microsomal protein. the free
warfarin concentration
where half of the binding
sites were occupied was 77 nm (standard error 10%).
in general, the standard error of the parameter estimate of the maximal binding capacity was less than
10%. the estimate of the concentration
of halfmaximal binding, however, showed errors ranging
between 5 and 100%.
pretreatment
of the microsomes with dithiothreitol (d7t, 5 mm) reduced the microsomal
specific warfarin binding (fig. 1). binding, however,
was not compietely abolished, but the binding curve
seemed to be shifted to the right.
there were no differences between r- and swarfarin in their microsomal binding. the following
values were obtained for the binding capacity:
44 -+ 5, 38 + 6, 40 ?i 1 (mean * sd, n = 3) pmole/

were:

respectively. al1 further experiments,
therefore,
were performed with racemic [’ yjwarfarin.
warfarin binding was investigated in liver microsomes of warfarin resistant rats. two genetic strains
of warfarin resistance were compared: the welsh and
the scottish genotype. as can be seen from the plots
in fig. 2, microsomes of the welsh type warfarin
resistant (hw) rats showed weak warfarm binding in
comparison to the control (tas) and to the scottish
resistant (hs) ones. binding capacities for the tas
and hs microsomes were about 40 and 34 pmole/mg
microsomal protein with half maximal saturation at
about 80 and sonm free warfarin, respectively. reli-

concomitant with the experiments intended to
study the effect of  xxxd3522xxx  or vitamin ko on
the microsomal warfarin binding, the effect of the
vehiculum used to dissolve these vitamins, i.e. triton
x-100, was investigated (table 1). the results
showed the detergent (0.05%; w,v) to reduce the
microsomal binding capacity. apparently, the presence of  xxxd3522xxx  or vitamin ko (0.2 mm) counteracted this effect. to make the findings more
conclusive, the effect of vitamin ko on b,,, was
assayed using isopropanol as the vehiculum of the

the effect of the in viuo  xxxd990xxx  administration

binding capacity to decrease to about 10% of control

beyond the 0.3 mg/kg dose no further suppression
was observed (table 2). microsomal vitamin ko

the reductase activity from beyond 20% of control
activity showed a linear relationship to the microsomal warfarin binding (fig. 3a). the microsomal swarfarin content following the in uiuo  xxxd990xxx 
administration increased up to a plateau of about
14 ng (46.2 pmole)/mg microsomal protein which
was reached after 0.3 mg/kg  xxxd990xxx . the in vitro
microsomal warfarin binding was inversely related
to the microsomal  xxxd990xxx  content (fig. 3b).
all the results strongly support the idea that the
specific microsomal4-hydroxycoumarin
binding site
is identical with the enzyme vitamin ko reductase.
as, with hindsight, it was understandable that no
differences in microsomal binding between r- and
 xxxd990xxx  were observed (see also discussion
section) we looked for differences in the rates of
association of the 4-hydroxycoumarin
isomers and
the microsomal binding site. as the binding of 4hydroxycoumarins to the microsomes, i.e. to vitamin
ko reductase, in vitro is irreversible [15], the binding
curves do not represent an equilibrium process but
rather the rate of association in a titration process.
therefore, it was reasoned that should there be any
difference in rate of association, the more potent senantiomers would inhibit [14c]warfarin binding by
50% at lower concentrations
than the r-enantiomers. as can be seen from the results in table 3
no differences between the r- and s-enantiomers
were observed. the results suggest, however, the

association or reaction rate to be higher for  xxxd59xxx  and  xxxd2911xxx 
than for warfarin.
statistical analysis (unpaired student’s t-test), however, showed significant differences only between swarfarin and s- xxxd2911xxx .
discussion

the results confirm the presence of a specific war(= 4-hydroxycoumarin)
binding
site in rat liver
microsomes. microsomal warfarin binding has been
the subject of study already in 1970 by the group of
suttie [3,4] and by searcy et al. [5]. at that time one
was unaware of the biochemical systems for vitamin
k function, but the differences in microsomal warfarin binding between warfarin sensitive and warfarin
resistant (welsh type) rats were seen as an indication
for the involvement of a  xxxd3522xxx  related system
[5]. from in oiuo [14c]warfarin liver distribution and
in uiuo displacement studies we recently suggested
the microsomal 4-hydroxycoumarin
binding component to be related to the enzyme vitamin ko
reductase [15]. the present results give further support for this.
before discussing the results in more detail it has
to be emphasized that the specific microsomal 4hydroxycoumarin binding essentially is irreversible,
i.e. in vitro the bound 4-hydroxycoumarin cannot be
washed out or dialyzed [12, 131, nor can it be disfarin

microsomal warfarin binding and  xxxd3522xxx  2,3-epoxide reductase
placed [4,15]. hence, the binding curves although
suggestive for receptor ligand interactions, in fact
are titration curves [4], and what seems to be the
apparent dissociation constant is the point where at
the test conditions half of the binding sites were
titrated. nevertheless, a one site ligand binding
model was fitted to the data to estimate the total
amount of binding sites and the free warfarin concentration
at the condition
of 50% titration.
obviously, the latter parameter has no physical
meaning. one would expect this parameter to be
inversely
dependent
on the incubation
time.
however, in an experiment where we compared 10
and 30 min incubation times no differences were
observed (results not shown). in any case, we believe
that the wide ranges observed in values for 50%
titration is because we are not dealing with a true
receptor ligand equilibrium. our discussion therefore mainly will deal with the data on the specific
warfarin binding capacity.
the models proposed in literature for the mechanistic function of vitamin ko reductase contain (1)
two active site sulfhydryl groups which after substrate
reduction have to be reactivated by a dithiol [8], or
(2) a dithiol substrate binding site [lo]. for both the
models, it is proposed that only in the inactive stage,
i.e. the oxidized form (model 1) or in the absence of
the dithiol substrate (model 2), the enzyme binds 4hydroxycoumarins
[lo]. the observed microsomal
warfarin binding following dtt pretreatment is not
fully compatible with this postulate; no complete
abolishment of the binding was seen (fig. 1). the
residual binding might be due to enzyme titration
as soon it got oxidized (by air) or as soon dtt
dissociated. alternatively,
the binding curve depicts a binding shift to the right rather than a slowed
titration, suggesting a dtt-dependent
affinity of
warfarin for the enzyme. this explanation, however,
is not compatible with the observation, own and that
of others [ 10,191, that upon pretreatment with dtt,
the warfarin inhibition of the microsomal vitamin
ko reductase initially is zero but increases in time.
if, on the other hand, warfarin is added to reductase
assays before dtt, a potent inhibition is observed
which remains constant.
the absence of stereoselectivity in total warfarin
binding merely shows that stoichiometrically both
isomers bind equally to the enzyme. the absence of
significant differences between the warfarin isomers
for the concentration where half of the enzyme was
titrated suggests that their rates of association with
the enzyme do not differ grossly. neither were there
differences between the isomers of  xxxd59xxx 
and  xxxd2911xxx 
in their potency to inhibit
[ i4c]warfarin binding (table 3). this would indicate
that this step is not the base for the stereoselectivity
in 4-hydroxycoumarin
anticoagulant activity. contrary to these findings, searcy et al. [5] reported the
warfarin binding protein they isolated by cosedimentation with ribosomes, to be selective for the senantiomer. warfarin binding to this protein also
was reported to compete with  xxxd3522xxx . in this
study, however, a competition between the in uitro
microsomal warfarin binding and  xxxd3522xxx  or vitamin ko was not observed (table 1). the absence
of any competition is in agreement with the proposed

1119

interaction mechanisms [10,201. the differences of
our observations with those reported by searcy et al.
[5] suggest that the warfarin binding protein isolated
by the latter group might be unrelated to vitamin
ko reductase. concerning the stereoselectivity for
anticoagulant activity of the 4-hydroxycoumarins, we
recently presented evidence that the reactivation of
the enzyme-anticoagulant
complex is the ultimate
stereosensitive step [20].
in agreement with the results of lorusso and suttie
[4] and searcy et al. [5], we found the microsomal
binding capacity for warfarin resistant rats of the
welsh genotype to be reduced (fig. 2). the microsomes of the scottish warfarin resistant strain, on
the other hand showed “normal” warfarin binding
behavior. these findings are in accordance with the
properties of the vitamin ko reductases of these
rats: welsh type resistant vitamin ko reductase
shows weak affinity for warfarin thus explaining its
resistance to 4-hydroxycoumarins
[21]; in addition,
the amount of enzyme is less. the scottish and the
sensitive enzyme do not differ in their affinity for
warfarin [22]. the resistance of the scottish strain is
suggested to be due to a facilitated reactivation of
the enzymea-hydroxycoumarin
complex [ 141. the
reactivation of the enzyme of the sensitive rat is slow:
in viva it takes about 4 hr to reactivate 50% of
the vitamin ko reductase- xxxd990xxx 
complex [20].
apparently, as soon the liver structure is disrupted
the system responsible for the reactivation of the
enzyme and/or the enzyme+hydroxycoumarin
complex is lost, and the coumarin remains irreversible bound to the enzyme. this allows the in uitro
assay of the remaining enzyme either by reductase
assay, i.e. substrate conversion, or by [c14]warfarin
binding. this was demonstrated by the experiments
described in table 2 and fig. 3. the linearity between
the microsomal vitamin ko reductase activity and
the microsomal warfarin binding capacity (fig. 3a)
once more indicates their mutual relationship.
assuming a one-to-one stoichiometry for the 4hydroxycoumarin and vitamin ko reductase interaction,
the results
indicate
about
40pmole
(39.5 * 6.5, mean of nine different livers; each binding assay was performed at least in duplo) of enzyme
to be present per mg of microsomal preparation. a
warfarin binding capacity of 40 pmol/mg microsomal
protein was also observed by lorusso and suttie [4].
searcy et al. [5] reported somewhat higher values;
about 50-60 pmole. assuming 50% recovery for liver
microsomes [23], liver tissue would contain about
1.5 nmole of vitamin ko reductase per g wet weight.
this is lower than the reported in uiuo hepatic binding capacity; about 9 nmole for warfarin [l] or
4 nmole for s- xxxd59xxx 
[2]. this indicates
either the loss of enzyme during the isolation procedure of the microsomes, or the presence of
additional binding sites not associated with the
microsomal fraction. we previously reported the
mitochondrial fraction to contain specific warfarin
binding capacity but ascribed this to microsomal
contamination [ 151.
in conclusion, the results show the specific and
saturable microsomal4-hydroxycoumarin
binding to
be related with the target system of these drugs, i.e.
vitamin ko reductase. the binding site need not to

the enzyme has to interact with to function. enzyme
purification is needed to elucidate the unique interaction with the 4-hydroxycoumarins
and the role of
the dithiol reductor.
