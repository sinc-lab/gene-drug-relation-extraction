inhibition of myocardial na(+)-k(+)-atpase activity by  xxxd364xxx : role of potassium.  the effects of  xxxd364xxx  on the mg(2+)-dependent atp-hydrolytic action of myocardial na(+)-k(+)-atpase ( xxxg225xxx   xxxg265xxx   xxxg441xxx   xxxg621xxx   xxxg725xxx   xxxg726xxx   xxxg1213xxx   xxxg2173xxx   xxxg2174xxx   xxxg2428xxx .3) were studied in guinea-pig heart preparations in media containing various k+ concentrations. under "standard" conditions (5 mm k+),  xxxd364xxx  inhibited the na(+)-k(+)-atpase activity in a concentration-dependent fashion in the range of 0.001-80 mm, with an ic20 value of 0.19 +/- 0.05 mm and an ic50 value of 1.38 +/- 0.11 mm. reducing the k+ concentration from 5 to 2.5 mm enhanced the inhibitory action, shifting the effective (5-95% inhibition) concentration range to 0.0003-9.6 mm, with ic20 and ic50 values of 0.036 +/- 0.004 mm and 0.92 +/- 0.30 mm, respectively. on the other hand, increasing the k+ concentration to 10 mm shifted the range to 10-90 mm. the corresponding ic20 value was 0.48 +/- 0.02 mm and the ic50 was 2.24 +/- 0.36 mm. the results show that k+ plays an important role in the inhibition of myocardial na(+)-k(+)-atpase activity by  xxxd364xxx . this is probably pertinent to the mode by which the drug may interfere with the electrogenic na+/k+ pump activity of the enzyme, and, consequently, cause or aggravate cardiac arrhythmias.
