effect of histamine receptor antagonists on  xxxd150xxx -induced seizures and lethality in mice.  the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of h(1) ( xxxd186xxx  and  xxxd236xxx ) or h(2) (cimetidine and  xxxd2082xxx ) histamine receptor antagonists on the clonic phase, tonic seizures and morality of mice challenged with  xxxd150xxx  to induce convulsions in mice. moreover, the total plasma and brain concentrations of theophylline were evaluated.  xxxd236xxx  (1 mg/kg) did not affect the threshold for  xxxd150xxx -induced seizures, but when administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg, it significantly reduced the cd(50) value of  xxxd150xxx  from 249 mg/kg to 211 mg/kg (p < 0.01). the remaining histamine receptor antagonists studied i.e.,  xxxd186xxx  (up to 1 mg/kg), cimetidine (up to 40 mg/kg) and  xxxd2082xxx  (up to 10 mg/kg) had no impact on seizure susceptibility in  xxxd150xxx -induced convulsions. furthermore,  xxxd236xxx  (2 mg/kg) decreased latency to the clonic phase of  xxxd150xxx -induced convulsions from 51.1 +/- 4.5 to 32.1 +/- 4.3 min (p < 0.01). it is noteworthy that  xxxd236xxx , a novel h(1) receptor antagonist, did not alter the brain and plasma levels of theophylline, so the existence of pharmacokinetic interactions was excluded. our results indicate that some interactions between methylxanthines and histamine receptor antagonists may be clinically important since these drugs are usually combined during the treatment of status asthmaticus.
