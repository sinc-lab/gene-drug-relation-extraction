abstract
the epitopes important for receptor binding and activation of human interferon-b1a (ifn-b1a) were mapped
with monoclonal antibodies (mab), grouped on the basis of their specificity and ability to neutralize biologic
activity, and alanine scanning mutagenesis (asm). the binding properties of nine mab were defined, using
asm-ifn-b mutants having alanine substituted at targeted, surface-exposed residues. the results were correlated with the mab neutralizing potency. of six mab that bound either at or adjacent to the  xxxg1138xxx -2 receptor chain binding site defined by the asm epitopes, only three had measurable neutralizing activity. two
of these inhibited ifn-b/ xxxg1138xxx -2 complex formation, suggesting that steric hindrance of receptor binding
constitutes their mechanism of neutralization. however, two mab that bound to sites remote from the
 xxxg1138xxx -2 binding site on ifn-b also inhibited ifn-b/ xxxg1138xxx -2 complex formation and demonstrated potent
neutralizing activity. thus, neutralizing mab may employ mechanisms other than steric blockade to inhibit
directly the binding of receptor by cytokine, limiting their usefulness as tools to define precise receptor-ligand
interaction sites.

introduction

t

of the contacts
formed between a cytokine and its receptor contribute to
understanding the mechanism(s) of biologic activation that occurs upon cytokine binding. several methods exist for systematically mapping the regions of the molecular surfaces of cytokine and receptor that comprise the contact interface. such
regions can be defined at an atomic level of resolution by solving the crystal structure of the cytokine complexed with its receptor.(1–3) a method providing somewhat different information,(4) alanine scanning mutagenesis (asm), has also been
widely employed to map receptor binding sites for several
4-helix bundle cytokines, including human  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx 
(hgh),(5) erythropoietin (epo),(6) interleukin-2 (il-2),(7,8)
il-4,(9) granulocyte  xxxg526xxx  (g-csf), (10) and
human interferon-b (ifn-b).(11) an often used alternative method,
which is considered to define the cytokine’s receptor interache definition of molecula r details

tion site, that does not involve primary sequence changes employs cytokine-specific monoclonal antibodies (mab). although the affinity of such mab for cytokine and the precise
locations of the epitopes they recognize are generally unknown,
the mab can be grouped based on their relative ability to crossblock one another’s binding to the cytokine and to inhibit either the cytokine’s binding to its receptor or its biologic activity. in principle, the regions of the molecule that are important
for receptor binding or activation may thus be ascribed to the
cytokine epitope recognized by the blocking mab. however, it
is unclear that this circumstance is necessarily the case, as the
results of such an antibody-based method for receptor site mapping have not previously been compared systematically to
asm. such an analysis is reported herein for the helical cytokine(12) human ifn-b (huifn-b). the receptor for ifn-b comprises two known proteins,  xxxg1138xxx -1 (13) and  xxxg1138xxx -2,(14–16)
which upon ligand binding are activated to trigger immunomodulatory, antiproliferative, and antiviral responses.(17)

a systematic structure-activity analysis of huifn-b1a(11) exploited the analysis of its crystal structure(18) in the design of
a panel of mutant proteins having alanine substitutions only at
solvent-exposed residues potentially available to participate in
receptor binding. receptor binding measurements were coupled
with functional data to identify  xxxg1138xxx -2 and putative  xxxg1138xxx  binding sites and to help reveal their respective functional
roles. mutations in residues contributing to the  xxxg1138xxx -2
binding site were shown to cause proportionate reductions in
ifn-b receptor binding and activity, whereas mutations within
the putative  xxxg1138xxx -1 binding site on the opposite face of the
molecule, in contrast, resulted in functional effects that did not
correlate directly with effects on receptor binding. the results
of the complementary mapping approach employing ifn-bspecific mab reported herein are contrasted with those of asm.
the results indicate that neutralizing mab may use mechanisms
other than direct steric hindrance of an epitope to affect receptor binding of cytokine and biologic activity.

materials and methods
huifn-b
recombinant huifn-b1a used herein was produced in chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells and purified to .98% homogeneity at biogen, inc. (cambridge, ma). nonformulated, purified bulk ifn-b1a was used in  xxxg1138xxx -2-fc (extracellular domain
of the human  xxxg1138xxx -2 fused to the hinge, ch2 and ch3 domains of human igg1) binding assays and for immunizations. formulated ifn-b1a ( xxxd2371xxx ® ) was used in elisa, western blotting analyses, and antiviral assays. the specific activity for both
the bulk and formulated ifn-b1a is 2 3 108 iu/mg.

elisa for huifn-b
flat-bottom, 96-well elisa plates were coated with ifn-b1a
in coating buffer (50 ml/well, 1 mg/ml in 50 mm nahco3, 0.2
mm mgcl2, 0.2 mm cacl2, ph 9.6) and incubated overnight at
4°c. unadsorbed ifn-b was removed by washing the plates with
wash buffer (phosphate-bufferedsaline [pbs]/0.05% tween 20).
the plates were then blocked for 1 h at ambient temperature with
blocking buffer (200 ml 1% normal goat serum [jackson immunoresearch, west grove, pa] and 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx 
[bsa] in pbs). serial dilutions of antisera, ascites fluid, or purified antibody were added to each well (50 ml/well) and incubated for 1 h at ambient temperature. after additional washes, a
horseradish peroxidase (hrp)-conjugated antibody-specific
reagent (hrp-conjugated goat antirabbit igg, hrp-conjugated
donkey antirabbit igg heavy and light ( xxxd2262xxx ), hrp-conjugated
donkey antimouse igg  xxxd2262xxx , or hrp-conjugated streptavidin,
all with minimal species cross-reactivity [jackson immunoresearch]) in blocking buffer was added to each well and incubated
for 1 h at ambient temperature. plates were washed and developed using the peroxidase substrate, tetramethylbenzidine(tmb,
sigma, st. louis, mo), and absorbance at 450 nm was measured
using a spectramax plate reader.

ifn-b-specific antibodies
rabbit polyclonal antisera (serum 447 and anti-bg9418)
specific for ifn-b were prepared by immunizing new zealand

white rabbits with nonformulated ifn-b1a. two 200-mg subcutaneous (s.c.) injections, the first in complete freund’s adjuvant and the second in incomplete adjuvant, were administered
at a 20-day interval. seven days later, sera from the immunized
rabbits were taken and screened for ifn-b reactivity by elisa.
the igg proteins (anti-bg9418) were purified from pooled sera
of ifn-b1a-immunized rabbits by deae-matrix chromatography according to standard protocols.(19) the ifn-b-specific
mab b-02 (isotype igg1) was purchased from summit pharmaceutical (fort lee, nj). the ifn-b-specific mab bio 1
(igg2b), bio 2 (igg2a), bio 4 (igg2b), bio 5 (igg1), and bio
6 (igg2b) were prepared using standard techniques.(20) briefly,
rbf mice (jackson laboratories, bar harbor, me) were immunized twice via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route with 30 mg of
huifn-b1a, the first injection in complete freund’s adjuvant
and the second in incomplete adjuvant, administered at a 20day interval. seven days after the second injection, the sera of
the mice were tested by elisa for antibodies against ifn-b.
those mice with sera exhibiting ifn-b-specific antibodies received two intravenous (i.v.) injections of 20 mg ifn-b1a in
pbs, ph 7.0, at 4 and 2 days before killing of the animals and
harvest of their spleen cells for fusion with  xxxg179xxx -p3x.653
myeloma cells (fisher scientific, pittsburgh, pa). after hybridomas were selected in medium containing hypoxanthine,
adenosine, and thymidine (hat), hybridoma supernatants were
screened by elisa for antibodies specific for ifn-b1a. the ig
isotypes of the mab were determined by the isotype ab-stat
assay (sangstat, freemont, ca).
selected hybridomas were grown in balb/c mice to produce ascites, and antibodies were purified by protein asepharose chromatography according to the manufacturer’s instructions (amersham pharmacia biotech, piscataway, nj). the
ifn-b-specific mab, a1, a5, and a7, were generated against
recombinant, nonglycosylated ifn-b1b as described previously.(21) the mab a1 (igg1) from hybridoma supernatant that
had been equilibrated with immunopure a igg binding buffer
(pierce, rockville, il) was purified by protein a-sepharose
chromatography according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
the purified protein was then gel filtered, and fractions containing monomeric mab a1, free of aggregate, were pooled,
filter-sterilized, flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at
270°c. the mab a7 (igg2a) was purified from ascites fluid
(0.5 ml) by protein g-sepharose chromatography according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (amersham pharmacia
biotech). the concentrations of mab a1 and a7 were determined by absorbance measurements at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 214,500 l mol21 cm21.(22) the concentration of mab a5 (iga isotype) in ascites fluid was quantified
by western blot analysis. the mab a5 was used without purification in the elisa experiments described herein, following dilution of the ascites fluid to achieve an mab concentration of 10 mg/ml. the protein concentration of iga in mab a5
for use in the neutralizing assays was determined after purification by chromatography on thiophilic t-gel (pierce), and the
purity was verified by page. purified preparations of isotype
control mab were obtained as follows: igg2b (immunogen:
avian iga) and igg1 (immunogen: t2 mycotoxin) were obtained from southern biotech associates (birmingham, al),
and igak (m18-254) and igg2a (mopc-173) were obtained
from pharmingen (san diego, ca).

receptor-binding and neutralizing epitopes on ifn-b

alanine-substitution mutant proteins of ifn-b
generation of the alanine substitution mutant proteins of
ifn-b has been described previously.(11) briefly, his-ifn-b
proteins were expressed from plasmids encoding the wild-type
(wt) or mutant ifn-b gene downstream and in protein-reading
frame with a 14-amino acid, amino-terminal extension (composed of six histidines, 3 amino acid spacer [ssg] and an enterokinase cleavage site [ddddk]), which were transiently
transfected into ebna 293 human embryonic kidney cells (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). the expression levels of his-ifn-b
proteins in conditioned medium were quantified by elisa and
western blot analyses as previously described.(11)

mapping specificity of anti-ifn-b mab
to map the specificity of the anti-ifn-b mab, mutant and
wt his-ifn-b proteins were employed in western blot analyses
using standard techniques. western blotting was performed using page (4%–20% acrylamide, tris-glycine buffer) (owl
separation systems, portsmouth, nh) to separate 30 ng wt or
mutant his-ifn-b proteins under reducing conditions. the proteins were transferred to pvdf membrane (amersham pharmacia biotech), and immunoreactive bands were probed by either polyclonal rabbit antihuman ifn-b serum (1:2000 dilution,
447) (biogen, inc.) or ifn-b-specific mab (5 mg/ml). binding
of the rabbit antiserum and mab was detected using hrp-conjugated donkey antirabbit igg or hrp-conjugated donkey antimouse igg, respectively. western blots were developed using
enzyme-linked chemoluminescence (ecl) reagents (amersham pharmacia biotech), according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

solid-phase binding assay to measure effects of
anti-ifn-b on subsequent ifn-b  xxxg1138xxx -2
complex formation
to assess whether the ifn-b-specific mab hinder subsequent binding of ifn-b to the  xxxg1138xxx -2 receptor chain, an
elisa-based assay was developed. flat-bottom, 96-well
elisa plates were coated with 10 mg/ml mab  xxxg1417xxx -g5-aa9
(50 ml/well) overnight at 4°c. the  xxxg1417xxx -g5-aa9 mab, specific for the hinge or ch3 domain of human igg1, was generated in a fusion using spleen cells from mice that had been injected with a lymphotoxin-b (lt-b) receptor/human igg1
fusion protein.(23) it was selected on the basis of its fc reactivity and reactivity with a ch2-less lymphocyte functionassociated molecule (lfa)-3/human igg1 fusion protein.(24)
plates were then washed twice with wash buffer and blocked
with 0.5% nonfat dry milk/pbs (200 ml/well) for 1 h at ambient temperature. after two washes,  xxxg1138xxx -2-fc protein
(diluted to 1 mg/ml in dilution buffer: 0.5% nonfat dry
milk/pbs/0.05% tween 20) was added to each well (50
ml/well) and incubated for 1 h at ambient temperature. in parallel, serial dilutions (ranging between 10 fm and 1 mm in di-

of ifn-b-specific mab to preformed
ifn-b/ xxxg1138xxx -2 complexes
the binding of ifn-b-specific mab to ifn-b complexed
with an  xxxg1138xxx -2-fc fusion protein captured on a plate was
measured in an elisa. the  xxxg1138xxx -2-fc fusion protein, consisting of the extracellular domain of human  xxxg1138xxx -2 and the
hinge, ch2 and ch3 constant domains of human igg1, was
generated and purified after transient expression in cos7
green monkey kidney cells as described previously.(11) flatbottom, 96-well elisa plates were coated directly with  xxxg1138xxx -2-fc (50 ml/well) for 1 h at ambient temperature. after
two washes, nonspecific binding was blocked using 0.5%
nonfat dry milk/pbs (200 ml/well at 37°c for 1.5 h). after two
washes, serial dilutions of bulk ifn-b1a (10 fm–1 mm in dilution buffer, 0.5% nonfat dry milk/pbs/0.05% tween 20, 50
ml/well) were added to the plates and further incubated (1 h at
4°c), an incubation period longer than the half-life of ligandreceptor interaction and longer than that required for equilibrium to be reached. after two washes, aliquots (50 ml) containing either ifn-b-specific mab (10 mg/ml in dilution
buffer) or rabbit anti-ifn-b serum (447, biogen, inc.) at a dilution of 1:2000 were added, and the plates were incubated for
1 h at 4°c. detection of either the bound ifn-b-specific mab
or the rabbit anti-ifn-b (to control for ifn-b bound to  xxxg1138xxx -2-fc) was accomplished using the appropriate hrp-conjugated reagent.

lution buffer) of bulk ifn-b1a were incubated with mab (10
mg/ml or 100 mg/ml in dilution buffer) for 1.5 h at 4°c before
addition of the complexes to the  xxxg1138xxx -2-fc-captured elisa
plates. the plates were incubated with ifn-b/mab complex (50
ml) at 4°c for 2 h, an incubation period longer than the halflife of ligand-receptor interaction and longer than that required
for equilibrium to be reached. wells were then washed to remove excess  xxxg1138xxx -2-fc. after washing, a cocktail (50 ml)
containing rabbit polyclonal anti-ifn-b serum (447, biogen,
inc.) at 1:1000 dilution and hrp-conjugated donkey antirabbit
igg (1:2500 dilution) was added to the wells. the plates were
incubated for 15 min at 4°c and washed twice prior to detection of hrp conjugates as described. the average absorbances
(duplicate values measured at 450 nm) were plotted as a function of ifn-b concentration. a hyperbolic curve-fitting equation was used to determine the concentration giving a 50% maximal effect (ec50 values) for each experimental curve.

neutralization of ifn-b-mediated antiviral activity
by ifn-b-specific mab
ifn antiviral activity was measured by the cytopathic, naphthol blue-black, dye-uptake assay, using a549 (human lung carcinoma) cells challenged with encephalomyocarditis virus
(emcv) as described.(25) neutralization of ifn-b antiviral activity was measured by incubating dilutions of antibody samples with 10 laboratory units (lu)/ml of ifn-b1a for 2 h at

37°c prior to incubating them with a549 cells. following an
overnight incubation with mab/ifn-b mixtures or with ifn-b
alone, the cells were challenged with emcv. the neutralization assay end point is the concentration of mab required to reduce 10 lu/ml of ifn-b to 1 lu/ml.(26) neutralizing mab are
so defined as having neutralizing end points at mab concentrations of ,20 mg/ml (, 130 nm mab), a concentration representing a large excess over the picomolar concentrations of
ifn present in the assay. this value was chosen as it was considered that in order to bind to and sequester the ifn, and thus
inhibit in the assay, the mab must be present not only in excess over the ifn but also at a high concentration relative to
its kd for binding to the ifn. thus, a mab that binds to  xxxg1140xxx  with an affinity of, for example, 1 nm must be present in the
assay at concentrations significantly higher than 1 nm if a significant fraction of the ifn-b is to be bound by the mab. we
chose 20 mg/ml as a cutoff point because it is higher than the
kd that is expected for a mab of high or moderate affinity.

results
specificity of ifn-b-reactive mab
the specificity of nine human ifn-b-specific mab was evaluated using a panel of 15 alanine substitution mutant proteins
of human ifn-b obtained by transient expression in ebna 293

receptor-binding and neutralizing epitopes on ifn-b
human embryonic kidney cells as histidine-tagged proteins (hisifn-b) (described in fig. 1).(11) the results of western blotting analyses performed to determine the mab specific binding
are shown in figure 2. in these analyses, 30 ng of each of the
denatured, reduced his-ifn-b proteins was probed for immunoreactive bands with either the anti-ifn-b mab or an  xxxg1140xxx -specific rabbit polyclonal antiserum. mab bio 1, bio 2, a1,
a5, and bio 5 demonstrated similar western blotting patterns,
binding well to all the his-ifn-b mutants other than the ab
loop mutant, ab3, to which they failed to bind. western blots
also showed reduced binding of mab bio 1, bio 2, and bio 5
to the ab loop mutant ab2 (fig. 2). previously, residues in the
ab loop were also shown by peptide scanning to be important
for the specificities of mab a1 and a5 (fig. 1).(21,27) analysis
of the specificity of mab bio 4 (fig. 2) shows that its binding
to ab loop mutant, ab1, is also abolished. binding of mab
a7 is ablated by mutations in the c1 helix, and that of bio 6
is abolished by mutations in the cd2 loop (fig. 2). these re-

935

sults are consistent with results of cross-blocking studies (data
not shown), which showed that (1) mab bio 1, bio 2, bio 4,
and bio 5, which recognize the ab loop, cross-block one another’s binding to ifn-b, (2) ifn-b binding by mab bio 1,
bio 2, bio 4, and bio 5 was not cross-blocked by mab bio 6
or b-02, nor did mab bio 6 and b-02 cross-block one another,
and (3) mab a1 and a5 cross-block each other’s binding to
ifn-b, and a7 does not cross-block either a1 or a5.(21,27,28)
mab b-02 does not recognize wt ifn-b in western blots.
however, its specificity was determined previously using surface plasmon resonance (spr), which demonstrated that mab
b-02 failed to bind to mutants bc and c1 and showed diminished binding to mutant c2.(11) this result suggests that mab
b-02 recognizes noncontiguous sequences that span a patch of
the cytokine formed by the bc loop and c helix.
the mapping data demonstrate that all these ifn-b-specific
mab recognize epitopes distributed over the solvent-exposed
surface of the cytokine. this finding is illustrated in figure 3,

fig. 3. locations of the receptor and anti-ifn-b mab binding sites on the ifn-b molecule. the 3-d crystal structure of  xxxg1140xxx  is shown in space-filling models. four different views are shown, as indicated at the top. (top row) the positions of residues
important for  xxxg1138xxx -1 and  xxxg1138xxx -2 receptor chain binding(11) are shown in blue and red, respectively. the regions occupied
by the various alanine substitution mutants (a1 through e) are labeled on the molecule. (bottom row) the positions of residues
that when mutated to alanine abrogate or reduce the binding of anti-ifn-b mab are highlighted in different colors on the  xxxg1140xxx  molecule. shown in pale and dark blue are those that respectively abrogate or reduce the binding of mab bio 1, bio 2, bio 5,
a1, and a5. those abrogating mab bio 4, a7, or bio 6 binding are shown respectively in red, dark green, and purple. those
abrogating (bc, c1) or reducing (c2) b-02 binding are shown in pale and dark green.

aepitopes are identified by using either his-tagged asm ifn-b mutant proteins (designated as shown in fig. 1), spr (mab
b-02(11)), or western blot analysis (all other mab, fig. 2) and confirmed by elisa (data not shown). previously published peptide scanning data for mab a1 and a5(21,28) demonstrated that ab2 loop residues are important for their specificity, as indicated
by italic lettering. the indicated epitope is defined as the asm mutant to which the ifn-b-specific mab completely fail to bind.
mutant proteins to which the mab bio 1, bio 2, and b-02 showed reduced binding by spr or elisa are indicated in parentheses.
b values are the concentrations of mab required to reduce 10 lu/ml to 1 lu/ml.(26)
cthe quantitative effects of mab binding to ifn-b on the cytokine’s subsequent binding to ifnar2-fc are shown as the fold
increase in average ec50 values measured in three or more separate experiments. the standard errors are given in parentheses.
in experiments performed in the absence of anti-ifn-b mab or in the presence of isotype control mab, the average ec50 value
for ifn-b binding was 1.8 nm.

which shows four different views of a space-filling model for
the ifn-b molecule derived from its crystal structure and relates the mab binding sites to the receptor binding sites defined
previously by asm. (11)

neutralization of ifn-b-mediated antiviral activity by
ifn-b-specific mab
previous structure-activity studies, employing the ifn-b alanine substitution mutants, demonstrated that mutations in the
a2 helix, ab1 and ab2 loop, and e helix of ifn-b coordinately reduced  xxxg1138xxx -2 binding, cell surface receptor binding,
and antiviral and antiproliferative activities.(11) given the critical importance of  xxxg1138xxx -2 binding for biologic activities of
type i ifn, it might be predicted that the ifn-b-specific mab
that recognize the  xxxg1138xxx -2 binding site would reduce biologic
activity. antiviral assays were performed to test the neutralizing properties of the panel of mab and to determine the mab
concentrations required for neutralization. mab a1, a5, bio 5,
bio 6, and b-02 neutralized antiviral activity at mab concentrations ,20 mg/ml, whereas mab bio 1, bio 2, and bio 4 failed
to neutralize even at concentrations .170 mg/ml (table 1).
mab a7 exhibited minimal neutralizing activity, requiring concentrations .100 mg/ml (table 1), as expected from previous
studies demonstrating minimal neutralizing activity against natural (glycosylated) ifn-b.(21) isotype-matched control mab did
not neutralize ifn-b activity (data not shown). thus, the binding site specificities of mab as defined by asm do not necessarily correlate with their neutralization potency, suggesting that

the specificities of neutralizing mab may not necessarily predict receptor interactive sites.

assessment of ability of anti-ifn-b mab to bind to
preformed ifn-b/ xxxg1138xxx -2 complexes or to inhibit
formation of ifn-b/ xxxg1138xxx -2 complexes
a two-step approach was taken to investigate potential interference with ifn-b/ xxxg1138xxx -2 complex formation by the  xxxg1140xxx -specific mab. the first evaluated if the mab bind to preformed ifn-b/ xxxg1138xxx -2 complexes, and the second assessed
whether or not the mab can inhibit the binding of ifn-b to
 xxxg1138xxx -2-fc, a fusion protein composed of the extracellular
domain of human  xxxg1138xxx -2 and the hinge, ch2 and ch3, domains of human igg1. an elisa using plate-bound ifn-b/
 xxxg1138xxx -2-fc complexes was employed to evaluate if ifn-bspecific mab bind to preformed binary complexes as might be
expected if the epitopes involved are discrete from the ifnar2 binding site. the formation of the binary ifn-b/ xxxg1138xxx -2-fc
complex was demonstrated using a rabbit antiserum specific for
ifn-b (fig. 4). the results, as shown in figure 4, indicate that
only mab b-02 binds to the preformed ifn-b/ xxxg1138xxx -2-fc binary complex. these results indicate that the ifn-b/ifnar2-fc binary complex remains intact and that the epitope recognized by b-02 remains exposed under these conditions (fig.
4a). these observations are consistent with the mapping data
showing that the epitope for mab b-02 includes the  xxxg1138xxx -1
binding site, which is located distant from the  xxxg1138xxx -2 binding site. the failure of mab bio 1, bio 2, bio 4, bio 5, a1,

assessed by elisa. binding of mab to the ifn-b/ xxxg1138xxx -2fc complex was evaluated. (a) b-02 (squares with diagonal
cross). (b) a1 (open squares), a5 (open circles), bio 6 (open
triangles). (c) bio 1 (horizontal crosses), bio 2 (inverted, filled
triangles), bio 4 (open circles).

tant protein cd2) recognized by bio 6 is not included in the
 xxxg1138xxx -2 binding site (fig. 3, top right).
as it is possible that the mab acted to disrupt the preformed
binary complex in the assay format employed, a second approach was employed that evaluated whether the ifn-b-specific mab can inhibit the binding of ifn-b to  xxxg1138xxx -2-fc. in
these experiments,  xxxg1138xxx -2-fc was captured on elisa plates,
and the binding of the preformed ifn-b/mab complex to the
receptor chain was evaluated using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum specific for ifn-b. in the absence of mab, increased ligand binding (measured as absorbance at 450 nm) to ifnar2-fc was detected as a function of increasing concentrations of
ifn-b (fig. 5). in experiments performed in the absence of antiifn-b mab or in the presence of isotype control mab, the average ec50 value for ifn-b binding was 1.8 nm. when  xxxg1140xxx  was preincubated with 10 mg/ml of the neutralizing mab
b-02, a5, bio 5, or bio 6, subsequent binding of ifn-b to
 xxxg1138xxx -2-fc was markedly reduced (fig. 5a, b, c and table
1). the mean ec50 values for ifn-b binding in the presence of
mab b-02, a5, bio 5, and bio 6 were found in multiple experiments to be increased by factors of .500-fold, 18-fold, 4fold, and 27-fold, respectively, relative to the ec50 values measured without mab. the neutralizing mab a1 and the
nonneutralizing mab bio 1, bio 2, and bio 4 had no effect
when tested under the same conditions (fig. 5c and data not
shown). however, when mab bio 1, bio 2, bio 4, a1, and a7
were tested at 100 mg/ml, slight reductions in ifn-b binding
to  xxxg1138xxx -2-fc were observed, resulting in 1.6–4.8-fold increases in ec50 values (fig. 5d and table 1).

discussion

and a5 (fig. 4b,c) to bind to the complex suggests that their
binding sites on ifn-b were sterically occluded or altered by
 xxxg1138xxx -2-fc binding. interestingly, mab bio 6 also failed to
bind to the ifn-b/ xxxg1138xxx -2-fc complex, although the crystal
structure(18) indicates that the ifn-b epitope (defined by mu-

high-affinity binding and biologic activation of cells by  xxxg1140xxx  require the expression of the  xxxg1138xxx -1 and  xxxg1138xxx -2 receptor chains and the janus kinases,  xxxg2364xxx  and  xxxg1219xxx , which are noncovalently associated, respectively, with the receptor chains’
intracellular domains.(29) the residues of ifn-b required for
activity and receptor binding have been elucidated using an
asm approach.(11) portions of the a and e helices and the ab
loop that are clustered and accessible on one face of the molecule were shown to contribute to the  xxxg1138xxx -2 binding site (fig.
3). a putative  xxxg1138xxx -1 binding site was mapped to portions
of the b and d helices and the de loop, clustered on the opposite molecular face (fig. 3).

fig. 5. effect of anti-ifn-b mab on subsequent ifn-b/ xxxg1138xxx -2 complex formation. the effect of binding of the ifn-b mab
to the cytokine on the subsequent binding of ifn-b to plate-bound  xxxg1138xxx -2-fc was evaluated by elisa. the ifn-b binding
curves shown were determined from the best-fit of the data to a hyperbolic binding equation. the binding of  xxxg1138xxx -2 to  xxxg1140xxx  that was not preincubated with anti-ifn-b mab is shown in each panel by the solid squares. ifn-b binding to  xxxg1138xxx -2-fc
measured in the presence of (a) 10 mg/ml each of mab b-02 (squares with diagonal cross), bio 5 (open circles), or murine isotype controls: igg2b (solid circles), igg1 (open diamonds), (b) mab a1 (100 mg/ml, open triangles), a7 (100 mg/ml, circles
with diagonal cross), a5 (10 mg/ml, open circles), or murine isotype controls: igg2a (100 mg/ml, open diamonds), iga (10 mg/ml,
inverted triangles), (c) 10 mg/ml each of mab bio 1 (open circles), bio 4 (open triangles), bio 6 (open squares), or murine isotype control igg2b (open diamonds), (d) 100 mg/ml each of mab bio 1 (open circles), bio 2 (horizontal crosses), bio 4 (open
triangles), or murine igg2b isotype control (open diamonds).

pacity of mab a5, bio 6, b-02, and bio 5 (but not a1) to inhibit  xxxg1138xxx -2 binding correlates with their ability to neutralize the antiviral activity of ifn-b. importantly, among this
group, only mab bio 5 and a5 recognize an epitope that maps
to the  xxxg1138xxx -2 binding site of ifn-b. although the epitopes
recognized by mab bio 1, bio 2, bio 4, and a1 also map to
the  xxxg1138xxx -2 binding site, markedly higher concentrations of
these mab are required to inhibit the binding of ifn-b to
 xxxg1138xxx -2, and of this group, only mab a1 neutralizes antiviral
activity. the requirement for very high concentrations of these
mab to affect  xxxg1138xxx -2 binding suggests that the affinity of
their binding to putative neutralizing epitopes on ifn-b is such

that among these, only mab a1 neutralized. consequently, the
failure of mab bio 1, bio 2, and bio 4 to neutralize ifn-b antiviral activity may be due to their inability to effectively compete with cell surface receptor for cytokine binding at the antibody concentrations used in the antiviral neutralization assay.
thus, only a subset of the mab exhibited behavior that correlated with the locations of their binding epitopes in relation to
the receptor binding sites on ifn-b.
mab a7 was shown herein to recognize an epitope in the
c1 helix on the opposite face of the ifn-b molecule from the
 xxxg1138xxx -2 binding residues. mab a7 did not neutralize in antiviral assays (as $100 mg/ml of mab a7 was required) or in-

receptor-binding and neutralizing epitopes on ifn-b
hibit  xxxg1138xxx -2 binding in these assays, nor did it bind to the
preformed ifn-b/ xxxg1138xxx -2-fc binary complex. mab a7 may
be inactive in these assays because either the conformation of
its binding site is altered when ifn-b interacts with the ifnar2 receptor chain or it has a low affinity for the glycosylated
ifn-b employed herein. mab a7 is reported to have less neutralization activity on glycosylated natural ifn-b than on
ifn-b1b, an unglycosylated ifn-b mutant to which it was
raised.(21) although the effects of the absence of the carbohydrate from the naturally glycosylated ifn-b are not assessed
herein, the proximity of the c1 helix to the  xxxg1138xxx -1 binding

939

domain and the glycosylation site at asparagine 80 adjacent to
the c1 site suggests that mab a7 may neutralize ifn-b1b antiviral activity by interfering with  xxxg1138xxx -1 interactions.
notably, neutralizing mab b-02 and bio 6, which do not
recognize an ifn-b epitope in the  xxxg1138xxx -2 binding site, block
 xxxg1138xxx -2 binding (fig. 5). mab b-02 also binds to the preformed ifn-b/ xxxg1138xxx -2-fc binary complex (fig. 4a), confirming its recognition of an epitope distant from the ifnar2 binding site. these results with mab b-02 show that the
ifn-b epitope recognized by a mab need not coincide with the
 xxxg1138xxx -2 binding site or be occluded by  xxxg1138xxx -2 binding in

order for the mab to affect the ability of ifn-b to bind ifnar2. in contrast, mab bio 6 fails to bind to the preformed  xxxg1140xxx / xxxg1138xxx -2 complex, showing that receptor binding inhibits
subsequent mab binding even at remote sites.
taken together, the results suggest that the mechanism of
neutralization by mab b-02 and bio 6 does not depend on direct competition with a receptor chain for cytokine binding and
might reflect that these mab alter ifn-b to hinder its accessibility to the receptor. alternatively, although it is generally assumed that the functional reactivity of a mab reflects local effects derived from the binding of its variable region, it can be
postulated that the binding of mab bio 6 and b-02 has distant
effects on the structure and properties of ifn-b. a recent
study(30) suggested that antibodies are more likely to cause distant perturbations in the structure of a protein antigen if they
bind to a mobile epitope, forcing it to conform to that required
for optimal complementarity to the antibody binding site. in the
case of ifn-b, as the asymmetric unit of the crystal is composed of two cytokine molecules possessing somewhat different conformations (termed molecule a and molecule b),(18)
flexible regions might show conformational differences between molecule a and molecule b. moreover, flexible regions
of a structure possess high values for the crystallographic b factor (also called temperature factor), which is a function of the
amplitude of atomic vibration. examination of the crystallographic data for ifn-b (fig. 6a) shows a plot of b factor values (blue line) and the positional shifts of the ca atoms between molecule a and molecule b (magenta line), plotted as a
function of the position of each residue in the primary sequence
of ifn-b. two extended regions of high flexibility comprising
residues 20–31 and residues 109–121, which span the ab1 loop
and cd loop, respectively, as depicted on the ifn-b structure
in figure 6b, are revealed. this suggests that mab bio 6 binds
to a flexible region, the cd2 loop of the ifn-b structure, and
could affect the structure and binding properties of the remote
 xxxg1138xxx -2 binding site on ifn-b.(11) furthermore, as the binding of  xxxg1138xxx -2 occludes subsequent ifn-b binding of mab
bio 6, one can also speculate that  xxxg1138xxx -2 binding alters cd
loop structure. the ifn-b binding site of mab b-02 includes
residues that do not have moderately high b factor values,
whereas others do not (fig. 6). thus, it is difficult to speculate
whether the induction of conformational changes could account
for the effects of mab b-02 on  xxxg1138xxx -2 binding of ifn-b.
that cytokine-specific mab may alter the interactions of the
cytokine with its receptor, even though the epitopes recognized
by the mab do not coincide with the receptor binding sites, also
pertains to other small, single-domain proteins. for both
hgh(31) and epo,(32,33) anticytokine mab have been reported
that neutralize, although they do not bind to the receptor-interacting regions on the cytokine. this behavior is similar to that
seen with mab bio 6 and b-02 in this study. further, published
antibody epitope mapping data(33,34) contain examples of antibodies that do not neutralize epo activity, although the antibodies bind to regions of epo that more recent structural
work(2) has shown interact directly with the receptor. this behavior may be similar to that seen with mab bio 1, bio 2, and
bio 4 in this study and may result from low mab binding affinities. moreover, mab may fail to block activity despite binding
to epitopes that coincide with receptor binding regions on a cytokine. it was shown recently that interaction site mapping by

runkel et al.
asm of affinity-determining residues and by x-ray crystallography of contact residues provides somewhat different pictures
of the structure of a protein binding surface.(4) the results described herein suggest that interaction site mapping using mab
may provide yet another experimental perspective on the structure and location of protein interaction sites, with the limitation
that mab binding may have effects other than steric blockade
that may make them unreliable probes of the structural details
of cytokine/receptor and other protein/protein interactions.
