the alkylhydroquinone 10′(z)-heptadecenylhydroquinone [hq17(1)], isolated from the sap of the
lacquer tree rhus succedanea, was found to inhibit the activity of tyrosinase and to suppress melanin
production in animal cells. the ic50 of hq17(1) as a tyrosinase inhibitor was 37 µm versus 70 µm for
hydroquinone (hq), a known inhibitor of tyrosinase and melanogenesis. for the inhibition of melanin
production in mouse b16 melanoma cells, the ec50 of hq17(1) was 40 µm versus 124 µm for hq.
hq17(1) induced much less oxidative stress than did hq. the effectiveness in inhibiting melanin
production could be mimicked by intermittent exposure of cells to hq17(1). the potent inhibitory
effects of hq17(1) on tyrosinase activity and melanin production are likely due to its heptadecenyl
chain, which facilitates retention of the compound in cell membrane compartments and may impede
oxidation of the hydroquinone ring. as tyrosinase activity accounts for postharvest browning of botanical
products and animal skin melanogenesis, hq17(1) could be useful for the preservation of these
products or as a skin-whitening cosmetic.

introduction

the tyrosinases ( xxxg2367xxx ) are a class of oxidoreductases.
proteins with tyrosinase activity have been isolated from a wide
variety of organisms including plants, fungi, bacteria, insects,
amphibians, and mammals. tyrosinases from different species
are diverse in their primary protein structure, tissue distribution,
and cellular location. all tyrosinases have in common a coppercontaining catalytic center (1, 2). also known as polyphenol
oxidase, tyrosinase in plants catalyzes the postharvest oxidation
of  xxxd1979xxx  compounds. this consequently leads to brownish oxidation products that often reduce the market value of
botanical and fishery products (3, 4). in mammalian skin,
tyrosinase exists as a type i transmembrane protein that catalyzes

melanogenesis in epidermal layers. the enzyme oxidizes
tyrosine to  xxxd2471xxx  (l-dopa) and subsequently to dopachrome, which further polymerizes to melanin
(5, 6). although melanin absorbs and scatters uv light, reducing
the harmful effects of sunlight on skin, overproduction of
melanin sometimes brings about an undesired skin tone.
therefore, the development of high-quality tyrosinase inhibitors
that can be used as preservatives for fresh food or as skinwhitening agents has been pursued. the search for a plant source
of tyrosinase inhibitors is a focus of phytochemical research
because plants constitute a rich source of bioactive chemicals,
and it has been reported that most of these compounds possess
few harmful adverse effects (7, 8).
hydroquinone (hq) is a well-known tyrosinase inhibitor and
antimelanogenesis compound that has been used as an active
ingredient in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals since the 1960s.
however, hq was found to irritate skin and, after long-term
use, it may cause permanent leucoderma, scarring, or ochronosis.
the use of hq in cosmetics has been banned by the european
committee, and now its use is limited in formulations prescribed
by physicians and dermatologists (9). in addition to the
detrimental effect on skin, the safety of hq has been further
questioned because both in vitro cell studies and animal

alkylhydroquinone as tyrosinase inhibitor
experiments indicate that the compound could be mutagenic and
tumorigenic. these harmful effects may be due to the fact that
hq is readily oxidized by cellular enzymes. its oxidation
products, quinones and reactive oxygen species (ros), cause
oxidative damage to cellular proteins, dna, and membranes
(9-11). hq and hq-glycoside are contained in our diet. wheat,
rice, pears, onions, and berries or drinks such as coffee and tea
are rich in hq (9). hydroquinone-o-beta-d-glucopyranoside
(arbutin) from the california buckeye has been characterized
as a tyrosinase inhibitor. another hq derivative, gentisic acid
(2,5- xxxd30xxx ), from gentian roots has also been
found to be a tyrosinase inhibitor. these two hq derivatives
have been indicated to act as prodrugs; that is, the compounds
exert their effect via the release of hq after being taken up by
cells (12). arbutin is currently a common whitening ingredient
in cosmetics, although the compound has been reported to
interfere with the uptake of tyrosine, thus negatively affecting
cell growth (13). in addition to inhibiting tyrosinase, it has been
implicated in the inhibition of  xxxd1640xxx -2-carboxylic
acid polymerase, another enzyme involved in the catalysis of
melanin polymerization (13). on the other hand, gentisic acid
and its alkyl ester derivatives, in addition to acting via release
of hq, may inhibit tyrosinase through binding to a copper ion
in the active site of the enzyme (14). in terms of safety, it has
been suggested that both gentisic acid and the alkyl gentisate
may be less mutagenic than hq, although further experimental
proof is needed (14).
we previously isolated three hydroquinone derivatives from
the sap of the lacquer tree rhus succedanea l. (15). lacquer
trees belonging to the sumac family (anacardiaceae) are
cultivated for their sap, which has been used as a coating
material for lacquer wares for thousands of years in asia. the
latex-like sap dries and polymerizes into a tough and brilliant
film. the forming of this polymeric film involves complicated
enzymatic oxidative coupling of a variety of biomolecules (16, 17).
in addition to this application, rhus has long been a folk
medicine in asia, and the medicinal uses have been recorded
in the ancient traditional chinese medicinal (tcm) document
“bern chao gan mo”. at least seven tcm preparations derived
from the fruit, leaf, root, or bark of the rhus trees have been
documented (18). the heptadecahydroquinone compounds
isolated from rhus sap (15), 10′(z)-heptadecenylhydroquinone
[hq17(1)], 10′(z),13′(e)-heptadecadienylhydroquinone [hq17(2)], and 10′(z),13′(e),15′(e)-heptadecatrienylhydroquinone
[hq17(3)] differ in certain biochemical properties and in their
cytotoxicity to various cell lines (19). hq17(1) (figure 1a)
was also isolated from tapirira guianensis (20) and has been
characterized as a cytotoxic compound in several cancer cell
lines (15, 20). however, in this study, this compound was shown
to exhibit relatively low cytotoxicity on skin cells and can inhibit
the activity of tyrosinase and melanogenesis. the inhibition
kinetics of hq17(1) on tyrosinase was characterized. furthermore, hq17(1) was compared with hq in both efficacy and
safety. cellular distribution of hq17(1) was studied and the
contribution of the hydrophobic heptadecenyl chain was discussed.

supelco inc. (st. louis, mo), respectively.
purification of hq17(1) from rhus sap. rhus sap was harvested
from lacquer trees planted in the mountainous area of central taiwan.
the purification protocol was modified from that described previously
(15). briefly, an aliquot of the sap (100 g) was mixed thoroughly with
etoh (80%, 900 ml). the mixture was centrifuged at 5000g for 5
min. the upper layer was mixed with an equal volume of meoh (20%).
the supernatant was subsequently extracted with a 3-fold volume of
ethyl acetate and centrifuged at 700g for 20 min. the ethyl acetate
layer was collected and vaccuum-dried. the residue was redissolved
in 100% etoh and subjected to hplc (chrom tech, inc., apple
valley, mn) on a preparative c-18 column, isocratic elution using 90%
meoh (5 ml/min), and a detector monitoring at a280nm. the purified
hq17(1) was dissolved in etoh, and the uv absorption spectrum was
measured using a spectramax m5 microplate reader with triple-mode
cuvette port (molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca). the purity was also
checked by hplc using an analytical c18 column, isocratic elution
by 90% meoh (1 ml/min), and a photodiode array detector (dad
230, chrom tech, inc.).
cell culture. mouse melanoma b16 and human melanoma a2058
cells were cultured in dmem supplemented with 10% fbs. mouse
primary melanocytes were cultured in opti-mem containing 10% horse
serum. both dmem and opti-mem contained 100 u/ml penicillin,
0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 2 mm
l-glutamine. all cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere
containing co2 (5%) at 37 °c and were propagated by brief treatment
with trypsin and then resuspended in the culture medium.
cell viability assay. cell viability was evaluated by measuring
cellular acid phosphatase (acp) activity. briefly, 5 × 104 cells in 1
ml of medium were cultured in 24-well plates and treated with various
concentrations of compounds for 72 h. after that, the cells were washed
twice with pbs and then  xxxd2822xxx  solution (100 µl  xxxd1891xxx  mm) containing

2202

j. agric. food chem., vol. 57, no. 6, 2009

0.1% triton x-100 in 0.1 m sodium acetate was added to each well.
after incubation at 37 °c for 30-40 min, the reaction was stopped by
the addition of naoh (10 µl at 1 n), and the absorbance at 410 nm
was measured using a spectramax m5 microplate reader (molecular
devices). the median effective concentration (ec50) was determined
as described previously (21).
assay for tyrosinase activity. a total volume of 180 µl of assay
mixture containing 1 mm l-dopa, 50 mm phosphate buffer (ph 6.8),
and different concentrations of test compounds was added to each well
of a 96-well plate and then incubated at 25 °c for 10 min. after that,
20 µl of aqueous tyrosinase solution (1000 u/ml) was added.
dopachrome production was determined by absorbance at 492 nm in
a microplate reader for 10 min (22).
assay for melanogenesis. the amount of melanin present in the
cell culture medium was used as an index for melanogenesis. culture
medium without phenol red was used to cultivate b16 cells, a2058
cells, and primary melanocytes. the cells (5 × 104 cells in 1 ml of
medium) were cultured in a 24-well plate and treated with r-msh
(0.1 µm) for 4 h. various concentrations of hq17(1) or hq were then
added, and then the cells were cultivated for a further 72 h. to study
the influence of intermittent drug exposure, b16 cells were exposed to
hq17(1) or hq for 1-8 h. after the exposure, the cells were washed
with pbs and further cultured in fresh medium for a total of 72 h,
including the drug exposure time. at the end, aliquots of culture medium
(200 µl) were transferred to a 96-well plate, and the amount of melanin
was evaluated by absorbance at 400 nm. the melanin level was
normalized to cell viability (22).
measurement of hq17(1) in cell membrane and cytosol
fractions. hq17(1) was recovered from membrane and cytosol
fractions of the treated cells and quantified by hplc. b16 cells (2.5 ×
106 cells in 6 ml of medium) were cultured in the presence of 40 µm
hq17(1). after cultivation for 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, or 72 h, cell membrane
and cytosol fractions were prepared with procedures modified from a
previous paper (23). briefly, the cells were collected by trypsinization,
washed twice with pbs, suspended in 200 µl of cell lysis buffer and
disrupted by sonication (10 s, twice). the cell lysates were centrifuged
at 13200g at 4 °c for 15 min to separate the membrane fraction
(residues) from the cytosol fraction (supernatant). to both fractions
was added 34.4 µg of hq17(2) as an internal standard (is) for
quantification of hq17(1) by hplc. to extract hq17(1) and the is,
both fractions were dispersed in absolute etoh with sonication (10 s)
and centrifuged at 5000g for 10 min, and then the supernatants were
collected. the extraction was repeated three times, and the volume of
etoh for each time was 1, 0.5, and 0.3 ml, respectively. finally, the
three extracts were combined, vaccuum-dried, and resuspended in 35
µl of etoh and subjected to analytical hplc; 10 µl was injected for
each chromatography. the quantities (µg) of the recovered hq17(1)
in the membrane fraction and the cytosol fraction were calculated on
the basis of the peak ratio of hq17(1) (retention time ) 21.1 min) to
the is (retention time ) 16.5 min) in the chromatogram.
cellular ros levels. melanoma b16 cells (5 × 106 cells in 3 ml
of medium) were cultured in 6-well plates and treated with various
concentrations of hq17(1) or hq for 8 h. dcfda was then added to
the wells, and the cells were cultured for another 30 min. after that,
the cells were washed with pbs, trypsinized, and then analyzed by a
flow cytometer (epics xl-mcl, beckman coulter, inc.). the data were
analyzed with expo 32 software (beckman coulter, inc.). cells with
increased ros content appeared as a population with a higher
fluorescence intensity (24).

results and discussion

purification and characterization of hq17(1). in the
preparative hplc condition, three hydroquinone derivatives,
hq17(3), hq17(2), and hq17(1), were consecutively obtained.
the retention times were 10.7, 12.1, and 16.0 min, respectively.
hq17(1) is the most hydrophobic molecule among the three
compounds. using the purification protocol described above,
the yield of hq17(1) was about 23 mg/g of sap. the purified

(*) indicates p < 0.05]; (b) lineweaver-burk plot of hq17(1). the
reactions of l-dopa (substrate) at concentrations of 1, 0.5, 0.25, and
0.125 mm were performed in the presence of 0, 25, or 50 µm hq17(1).
the initial velocity (v) of each reaction was measured, and then the
reciprocals of velocity and substrate concentration were plotted.

hq17(1) was identified by mass spectroscopy and nmr
spectroscopy as described previously (15). analytical hplc
equipped with a photodiode array detector (200-600 nm) and
uv absorption spectroscopy were routinely used to monitor the
identity and purity of the compound. in the analytical hplc,
the retention time for hq17(1) was 21.1 min. the uv
absorption spectrum of hq17(1) showed a profile to some extent
similar to hq but with shifted absorption peaks (figure 1b).
identification of hq17(1) as a tyrosinase inhibitor. the
capability of hq17(1) to inhibit tyrosinase activity was studied
using l-dopa as a substrate. the inhibitions of tyrosinase
activity by hq17(1) and by hq were compared and are shown
in figure 2a. in the concentration range of 0-50 µm, the
inhibition was dose-dependent for both inhibitors, and hq17(1)
inhibited tyrosinase more efficiently than hq. the ic50 of
hq17(1) was 37 µm, whereas that of hq was extrapolated to
be 70 µm. the inhibition kinetics of tyrosinase-catalyzed
l-dopa oxidation by hq17(1) was further characterized. as
shown in the lineweaver-burk plot in figure 2b and in the
summarized kinetic parameters shown in table 1, hq17(1)
exerted a mixed-type inhibition on tyrosinase. the kinetics
showed statistically significant increases in km (p < 0.05) and
less significant decreases in vmax (0.05 < p < 0.1). in a mixedtype inhibition, the substrate may bind to the enzyme active
site or the substrate-enzyme complex. we found that hq17(1)
was oxidized by tyrosinase at a very slow rate (data not shown),
suggesting it binds to the enzyme active site. the affinity of
hq17(1) binding to tyrosinase is much stronger than that of
l-dopa as revealed by the ki and km values; the former is
103 lower than the latter. whether hq17(1) binds to the

substrate-enzyme complex remains to be studied. when these
data are combined, it is evident that hq17(1) is a potent
tyrosinase inhibitor.
inhibition of melanin production by hq17(1) in mammalian cell lines. the ability of hq17(1) to inhibit melanin
production was evaluated using a cell-based assay. as shown
in figure 3, hq17(1) effectively inhibited melanin production
in the melanoma cell lines as well as in normal cells (primary
murine melanocytes). after a 72 h treatment, the ec50 values
of hq17(1) for inhibition of melanin production in b16 cells,
a2058 cells, and normal melanocytes were 40, 49, and 36 µm,
respectively. the greater observed inhibition of melanin production in normal melanocytes may be due to their higher melanin
production rate than the other two cell types. hq exerted less
inhibitory effects than did hq17(1) on melanin production in
these cell lines. the ec50 values of hq for inhibition of melanin
production in b16 cells and a2058 cells were extrapolated to
be 124 and 109 µm, respectively. it is clear that hq17(1) is a
more potent melanogenesis inhibitor than is hq. as for
cytotoxicity, the cell viabilities were 80% in b16 cells, 87% in
a2058 cells, and 89% in melanocytes at the ec50 of hq17(1)
for melanin production inhibition. thus, hq17(1) inhibited
melanin synthesis more efficiently than hq and exerted low
cytotoxicity.
eight hour intermittent treatment and 72 h continuous
treatment of hq17(1) caused the same level of inhibition
in cellular melanin production. as shown in figure 4a, timedependent inhibition of melanin production was observed when
b16 cells were intermittently treated with hq17(1) for 1, 2, 4,
or 8 h. the level of melanin production inhibition caused by
an 8 h intermittent treatment was about the same at 72 h of
continuous treatment. in contrast, intermittent treatment with
hq did not cause obvious melanin production inhibition. hplc
chromatograms of the membrane fraction extractions showed
two major peaks, the is (retention time ) 16.5 min) and
hq17(1) (retention time ) 21.1 min) (figure 4b). as the hplc
was monitored by a photodiode array detector, the identity of
each peak was confirmed by the uv absorption spectra. the
hplc chromatograms of the cytosol fraction showed many
peaks in addition to the is and hq17(1) (supporting information
figure 1). some of the additional peaks could be cellular
molecules, and the others might be metabolites of hq17(1);
further analysis by lc-ms is needed to prove this presumption.
the quantities of the recovered hq17(1) in the membrane
fraction [m-hq17(1)] and the cytosol fraction [c-hq17(1)] were
calculated. as shown in the inset of figure 4b, the m-hq17(1)
and c-hq17(1) were 28.0-38.7 and 18.0-38.2 µg, respectively.
the amount of m-hq17(1) leveled off after 8 h of treatment.
the amount of c-hq17(1) was increased from 4 to 12 h, but it
was decreased when the treatment was longer than 24 h,
indicating that there may be some intracellular hq17(1)
degradation on long-time incubation. for each time point, the
amounts of m-hq17(1) were slightly more than c-hq17(1). if
the cytosol/membrane volume ratio (cmvr) is considered, it

the cells were stimulated with r-msh and cultured for 72 h in the
presence of hq17(1) or hq. the level of melanin in the culture medium
was measured by absorbance at 400 nm, and cell viability was measured
by acp assay. the data presented are the averages derived from triplicate
experiments. the asterisk (*) indicates p < 0.05.

is conceivable that the concentration of hq17(1) in membrane
is much higher than in cytoplasm. as an example, cmvr for
a cell has been measured in neuron cells, and a value of 83 was
indicated (25). the concentration of hq17(1) in the membrane
could be several ten-fold higher than that in the cytoplasm. these
results suggest that hq17(1) is favorably associated with
membrane; thus, the m-hq17(1) reached a steady level at 8 h,
and the level was maintained later. as mammalian tyrosinase
is a trans-membrane protein (5), the steady concentration of
m-hq17(1) after 8 h of exposure may explain why the
intermittent treatment and 72 h continuous treatment of hq17(1)
caused the same level of inhibition.
hq17(1) induced less cellular ros than hq. as
indicated by previous studies, hq induced cellular ros, which
can lead to inflammatory responses and cellular oxidative
damage (10, 11). the induction of ros by hq17(1) or hq
was measured by dcfda staining and flow cytometry as shown
in figure 5a. the cells treated with 100 µm h2o2 served as a
positive control, and the high-ros cells were those with

figure 4. (a) inhibition of melanin production. b16 cells were treated
with hq17(1) or hq for the indicated time, and the cells were then cultured
in a medium without the drug. the cells in the control group were treated
with the drug for 72 h. at the end, melanin levels in the culture media
were measured. averages of data from triplicate experiments are shown.
(b) cellular distribution of hq17(1). the cells were treated with 82.6 µg

the cells were collected, the membrane and cytosol fractions were
prepared, and 34.4 µg of internal standard (is) was added for quantification
as described under materials and methods. ethanol extractions of both
fractions were subjected to hplc analysis. the hplc chromatogram
(monitored at a280nm) shows the recovered hq17(1) from membrane
fractions of cells treated with hq17(1) for 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. the

fluorescence intensity higher the arrow. the results shown in
figure 5a were analyzed by software, and the percentages of
the high-ros cell populations induced by hq17(1) and hq
were plotted and are shown in figure 5b. treatment of b16
cells with 40 µm hq17(1) (the ec50 for melanin production
inhibition) induced only a 7% high-ros cell population. hq
at the same concentration induced a 37% high-ros cell
population. when the concentration was raised to 60 µm, 19
and 48% high-ros cell populations were induced by hq17(1)
and hq, respectively. these results indicate that hq17(1)
elicited much less cellular ros than hq and could thus be a
better antimelanogenesis agent.
in this study, hq17(1) from the sap of r. succedanea was
found to inhibit the activity of tyrosinase in vitro and melanogenesis in mammalian melanocytes with better efficiency than
hq. furthermore, it elicited only 7% high-ros cell population
at the ec50 for melanin production inhibition, implying that
inhibition of melanin production by hq17(1) was not the result
of cell damage by ros. contrarily, hq at 60 µm (a concentration much lower than 124 µm, the ec50 for melanin production
inhibition) caused about 50% of the cells in a high-ros state,
suggesting that the decrease in melanin production by hq might
be the result of cell damage caused by ros.

in previous studies, hq17(1) was found to be toxic for cancer
cell lines of brain, breast, colon, lung, liver, and prostate origin.
the ec50 values for these cancer cell lines are at concentrations
less than or near 10 µm (15, 20). our study indicated that cells
of skin origin seem to be more resistant to hq17(1). the results
shown above demonstrate that hq17(1) was much less toxic
in melanoma cells and normal melanocytes. similarly, hq17(1)
was less toxic for human skin fibroblasts (ws-1 cells) or human
keratinocytes. when these skin cells were treated with 50 µm
hq17(1), the cell viability was kept around 90%. among the
three alkylhydroquinones isolated from rhus sap, hq17(3) is
the most cytotoxic for most of the test cell lines. we have
demonstrated that in hl-60 leukemia cells, the cytotoxicity
mechanism of hq17(3) involves  xxxg2312xxx  poisoning
(19). an in vitro assay showed that hq17(1) and hq17(3) at a
concentration of 40 µm caused 19 and 70% inhibition on
 xxxg2312xxx  activity, respectively. hq17(1) apparently is
not as good a  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitor as hq17(3). in addition
to being a weak  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitor, the low cytotoxicity
of hq17(1) may also due to the fact that hq17(1) is more
hydrophobic than hq17(3) and tends to be retained in the cell
membrane, thus readily inhibiting the function of membrane
protein, such as tyrosinase, and exerting less effect on nonmembrane proteins. the hydrophobicity of hq17(1) could also
account for its efficacy in antimelanosis achieved by intermittent
treatment. in addition to facilitating retention of the compound
in the membrane compartment, the inductive and mesomeric
effects of alkyl substituents on the aromatic ring system may

alkylhydroquinone as tyrosinase inhibitor
contribute to the impediment of oxidation of the hydroquinone
ring, thereby generating fewer ros.
in conclusion, we have demonstrated that hq17(1) is a more
effective and less harmful tyrosinase inhibitor than hq. in
addition to the conventional preservative or cosmetic applications, such a tyrosinase inhibitor might be pharmaceutically
useful for the treatment of parkinson′s disease. recently, many
researchers have indicated that tyrosinase activity contributes
to the formation of neuromelanin, which exacerbates dopamine
neurotoxicity and is associated with parkinson′s disease (26, 27).
the use of botanical tyrosinase inhibitors in medicine would
increase the additive value of agricultural products. however,
hq17(1) must, despite its undisputed advantages over hq, be
evaluated carefully in the same manner as hq, and its safety
must be proven before it can be envisaged to bring such a
compound into the food chain.
