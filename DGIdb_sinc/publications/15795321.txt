abstract
uptake by the  xxxg2149xxx  (dat) is the primary pathway for the clearance of extracellular dopamine (da) and consequently for regulating the magnitude and duration of dopaminergic signaling. amphetamine (amph) has been shown to
decrease simultaneously dat cell-surface expression and
[3h]da uptake. we have shown that insulin and its subsequent
signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k)-dependent pathway oppose this effect of amph by promoting
increased cell-surface expression. here, we used human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably expressing the human dat
(hdat cells) to investigate the downstream cellular components
important for this effect of insulin. akt is a protein kinase effector immediately downstream of pi3k. both overexpression of a
dominant-negative mutant of akt (k179r) and the addition of

dopaminergic neurotransmission is determined by extracellular da levels, which in turn are regulated principally by
dat-mediated da reuptake. because da uptake capacity
depends on the turnover rate of an individual transporter
and on the number of functional transporters expressed at
the plasma membrane, regulation of dat cell-surface expression is an important mechanism for fine-tuning da neurotransmission (beckman and quick, 1998; robinson, 2001;
kahlig and galli, 2003).

1-(5-chloronaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1h-hexahydro-1,4-diazepine hcl (ml9), a pharmacological inhibitor of akt, decreased
cell-surface expression of dat, suggesting a role of basal akt
signaling in the homoeostasis of dat. moreover, expression of
a constitutively active akt mutant reduced the ability of amph
to decrease hdat cell-surface expression as well as [3h]da
uptake. in contrast, overexpression of k179r blocked the ability of insulin to oppose amph-induced reduction of hdat cellsurface expression and [3h]da uptake, as did ml9. our data
demonstrate that hdat cell-surface expression is regulated by
the insulin signaling pathway and that akt plays a key role in the
hormonal modulation of amph-induced hdat trafficking and in
the regulation of basal hdat cell-surface expression.

several studies have identified signal transduction pathways that modulate dat trafficking and activity. activation
of protein kinase c (pkc), either by phorbol esters (phorbol
12- xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate) or by g␣q-coupled  xxxg2193xxx , decreases both dat cell-surface expression and
transport capacity (zhang et al., 1997; zhu et al., 1997;
daniels and amara, 1999; melikian and buckley, 1999; granas et al., 2003; loder and melikian, 2003). pkc-induced
trafficking has been observed also for other na⫹/cl⫺-dependent neurotransmitter transporters (nts), including the
serotonin transporter and the gaba transporter  xxxg2143xxx 
(blakely and bauman, 2000; robinson, 2001). in the case of
dat, pkc down-regulation has also been observed in rat
striatal synaptosomes (vaughan et al., 1997). it is curious
that pkc-induced trafficking does not seem to require phos-

akt regulates hdat cell-surface expression

phorylation of dat itself (granas et al., 2003) but instead
requires phosphorylation of another substrate.
tyrosine kinases, which are activated by insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1, have also been shown to regulate nt
function (law et al., 2000; gonzalez and robinson, 2004).
prasad et al. (1997) showed that activation of tyrosine kinases up-regulates the activity, cell-surface expression, and
gene expression of the human serotonin transporter. in hippocampal neurons, short-term inhibition of  xxxg2198xxx 
down-regulates  xxxg2143xxx  function with a concomitant decrease
in transporter cell-surface expression (law et al., 2000).
likewise, dat activity and cell-surface expression were also
reduced by  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors (doolen and zahniser,
2001).
insulin signaling, which enhances  xxxg2198xxx  activity
(elmendorf and pessin, 1999; taha and klip, 1999), increases norepinephrine transporter function (apparsundaram et al., 2001) and plays a critical role in the regulation of norepinephrine uptake by  xxxg99xxx  (yang and
raizada, 1999). the downstream effects of insulin include
the activation of pi3k. this lipid kinase phosphorylates the
d-3 position of phosphoinositides to generate mainly phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)p3 (taha and klip, 1999), which acts
at the plasma membrane as a second messenger. self-administration of amph is regulated by insulin signaling (galici et
al., 2000), and pi3k has been implicated in the regulation of
the behavioral actions of psychostimulants such as amph
and cocaine (izzo et al., 2002).
amph is believed to produce its behavioral effects by increasing extracellular da levels (koob and bloom, 1988).
amph achieves this increase by competing with da for uptake by dat, by inducing da efflux mediated by dat in a
na⫹- and ca2⫹-dependent manner (khoshbouei et al., 2003;
gnegy et al., 2004), and possibly by stimulating a redistribution of dat away from the plasma membrane (saunders et
al., 2000; gulley et al., 2002; chi and reith, 2003; kahlig and
galli, 2003). insulin stimulation reduced amph-induced intracellular accumulation of dat (carvelli et al., 2002). this
effect of insulin seems to be mediated by pi3k because transient expression of constitutively active pi3k also reduced
the amph-induced intracellular accumulation of dat
(carvelli et al., 2002).
although some progress has been made in understanding
how pkc affects nt localization and function (gonzalez and
robinson, 2004), the signaling pathways involved in hormonal (e.g., insulin) regulation of nt activity and cell-surface
expression are not well understood. akt is a central player in
insulin and growth factor signaling, and it is believed to
regulate several cellular functions, including cell growth and
apoptosis (hanada et al., 2004). three isoforms of akt have
been identified (hanada et al., 2004), and each of the three
akt isoforms contain a pleckstrin homology domain that interacts with membrane lipid products of pi3k, and this interaction is required for akt activation (hanada et al., 2004).
in mouse tissue, both akt1 and  xxxg119xxx  isoforms are ubiquitously expressed, whereas  xxxg120xxx  is relatively highly expressed
in brain and testis (hanada et al., 2004). in hdat cells, we
have explored the role of endogenous akt and recombinant
akt1 in the regulation of hdat surface expression and in
insulin regulation of hdat cell-surface expression. we provide evidence that basal activity of akt controls hdat
plasma membrane expression and that insulin requires the

activation of akt to regulate amph-induced hdat cell-surface redistribution.

materials and methods
cell culture. a fluorescently tagged hdat was constructed by
fusing the c terminus-encoding region of the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (yfp) cdna from peyfp-n1 (bd biosciences clontech, palo alto, ca) to the n terminus encoding region of the human
synthetic dat cdna (kahlig et al., 2004), thereby creating the
fusion construct yfp-hdat. this construct was subcloned into a
bicistronic expression vector (rees et al., 1996) modified to express
the synthetic hdat from a cytomegalovirus promoter and a hygromycin resistance gene from an internal ribosomal entry site (pcihyg), as described previously (saunders et al., 2000). em4 cells, a
human embryonic kidney 293 cell line stably expressing macrophage
scavenger receptor to increase adherence (kindly provided by r.
horlick, pharmacopeia, cranberry, nj), were transfected with the
yfp-dat using lipofectamine (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca), and a
stably transfected pool (hdat cells) was selected in 250 ␮g/ml hygromycin as described previously (ferrer and javitch, 1998; saunders et al., 2000). cells were grown in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°c and
5% co2.
uptake of [3h]da. [3h]da uptake was performed as described
previously (carvelli et al., 2002). hdat cells were seeded into 24-well
plates approximately 24 h before the experiment (150,000 cells/well).
after 2 h of serum starvation in khrt buffer containing 120 mm
nacl, 4.7 mm kcl, 10 mm hepes, 5 mm  xxxd3449xxx , 2.2 mm
cacl2, and 10 mm dextrose with 100 ␮m  xxxd228xxx , the cells were
treated in quadruplicate wells with amph in khrt buffer at ph 7.4
and 37°c. the plates were removed from the incubator, and the cells
were washed (three washes of 5 min each) with 4°c khrt buffer to
remove the amph from each well and inhibit protein trafficking
(saunders et al., 2000). the plates were then placed into an 18°c
incubator in khrt buffer containing 100 ␮m  xxxd2850xxx , a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. fifty nanomolar concentration of [3h]da
(amersham biosciences, piscataway, nj) and 15 ␮m da were added
to reach a final volume of 250 ␮l. cells were incubated for 2 min, and
then the solution was aspirated to terminate uptake. after three
quick washes with ice-cold uptake buffer, the cells were lysed with 1
ml of microscint-20 fluid (perkinelmer life and analytical sciences,
boston, ma). radioactivity was measured in a topcount scintillation counter (perkinelmer). specific uptake was defined as the total
uptake minus nonspecific uptake in the presence of 10 ␮m  xxxd2546xxx .
data were analyzed with prism 3.02 software (graphpad software
inc., san diego, ca).
in the experiments in which insulin was applied, we add insulin
(1:1000) to the incubating medium from a stock solution of 0.9%
nacl/12 mm hcl (vehicle) containing 1 mm insulin. the vehicle
itself had no significant effect on the parameters under study (data
not shown).
cell-surface biotinylation. cell-surface biotinylation experiments were performed as described previously (saunders et al.,
2000; kahlig et al., 2004) with slight modification. hdat cells were
seeded into six-well plates (106 cells/well) approximately 24 h before
the experiment. after 1 h of starvation in khrt buffer, the cells
were treated with amph in khrt at 37°c for the indicated time
points. the cells were washed twice with ice-cold pbs containing 0.1
mm cacl2 and 1 mm mgcl2 (pbs-ca-mg) and treated with ez-link
sulfo-nhs-biotin (1.5 mg/ml in pbs-ca-mg; pierce chemical, rockford, il) on ice for 1 h. the reaction was quenched by washing twice
with 4°c pbs-ca-mg containing 100 mm glycine (pbs-ca-mg-glycine) followed by an incubation with pbs-ca-mg-glycine for 30 min
on ice. cells were then washed twice with 4°c pbs-ca-mg before
lysis with 1 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (20 mm
tris, 20 mm egta, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% triton x-100)
containing protease inhibitors (100 ␮m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluo-

garcia et al.

ride, 5 ␮g/ml leupeptin, 5 ␮g/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm  xxxd302xxx )
for 30 min on ice with constant shaking. lysates were centrifuged at
14,000g for 30 min at 4°c. the supernatants were isolated, and
biotinylated proteins were separated by incubation with immunopure immobilized streptavidin beads (pierce) for 1 h at room temperature with constant mixing. beads were washed three times with
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors. biotinylated proteins were then eluted with laemmli loading
buffer for 30 min at room temperature. total cell lysates and biotinylated proteins (cell surface) were separated by sds-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (7.5%) and transferred to pvdf membranes (biorad, hercules, ca). pvdf membranes were incubated for 1.5 h in
blocking buffer (5% dry milk and 0.1% tween 20 in tris-buffered
saline) and immunoblotted with a rat monoclonal antibody directed
against the n terminus of the human  xxxg2149xxx  (1:2000
in blocking buffer; chemicon international, temecula, ca). immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat antibody (1:5000 in blocking buffer; santa cruz
biotechnology inc., santa cruz, ca) with ecl-plus on hypersensitive enhanced chemiluminescence film (amersham biosciences).
band densities were calculated using scion image software (scion
corporation, frederick, md) and normalized to the appropriate total
extract to control for protein loading. data were analyzed with prism
3.02 software and reported as mean ⫾ s.e.m.
transient expression of dominant-negative akt and constitutively active (myristylated) akt. hdat cells were transiently transfected with a “kinase dead” (kd) dominant-negative
mutant (k179r) of akt1 (akt-kd) using the polyfect transfection
method (qiagen, valencia, ca). the akt-kd mutant was made by
using polymerase chain reaction to mutate lys179 of akt-hemagglutinin (obtained from dr. r. roth, stanford university, stanford, ca)
to an arginine, and the mutation was confirmed by dna sequencing.
cells were incubated overnight in the presence of 2 ␮g of dna per
35-mm dish (biotinylation assays) or 0.5 ␮g per well of a 24-well plate
(uptake assays). a constitutively active akt1 (myrakt) (ballou et al.,

2001) subcloned into pcdna3.1 was transfected into hdat cells
using polyfect as described above. immunoblot analysis demonstrated that transient expression of k179r or myrakt did not alter
protein levels of dat with respect to cells transfected with the vector
alone (data not shown). the cells were used 48 h after transfection as
indicated for the uptake and biotinylation experiments.
immunoblots for phsopho-akt and total akt were obtained using a
ps473-akt ab (1:500) and a carboxyl-terminal akt mouse ab (1:1000)
(cell signaling technology inc., beverly, ma).

results
insulin modulates amph-induced hdat cell-surface redistribution and dopamine uptake. amph
causes hdat to redistribute away from the plasma membrane (saunders et al., 2000). this phenomenon is dynamindependent, because it is reduced by transient overexpression
of k44a, a dominant-negative mutant of dynamin (damke et
al., 1994). carvelli et al. (2002) recently demonstrated, by
means of confocal imaging, that the amph-induced decrease
in hdat plasma membrane expression was partially restored by subsequent stimulation of the pi3k-signaling pathway with insulin. to further characterize the hormonal regulation of hdat expression, we tested whether the timing of
insulin stimulation (i.e., before/after amph) was important
for its modulation of the amph-induced hdat cell-surface
redistribution. figure 1a shows immunoblots obtained from
hdat cells treated with either vehicle (ctr), 10 ␮m amph
for 30 min (amph 30⬘), or 1 ␮m insulin for 10 min followed
by 10 ␮m amph for 30 min in the continued presence of
insulin (ins ⫹ amph). although incubation of hdat cells
with amph significantly decreased the level of hdat protein
recovered in the surface-biotinylated fractions (fig. 1a, top

akt regulates hdat cell-surface expression

lane), preincubation with insulin followed by amph resulted
in cell-surface expression similar to that for ctr. likewise,
exposure of hdat cells to amph for 40 min (amph 40⬘)
decreased the level of hdat recovered in the biotinylated
fraction, whereas 10 ␮m amph for 30 min followed by 1 ␮m
insulin for 10 min in the continued presence of amph
(amph ⫹ ins) resulted in cell-surface expression similar to
that for ctr (fig. 1b, top lane). quantification of the biotinylated bands obtained from three different experiments as in
fig. 1, a and b, is shown in fig. 1, c and d, respectively.
incubation of hdat cells with insulin (1 ␮m) for 40 min
significantly increased hdat cell-surface expression to
145 ⫾ 9.6% of ctr levels (inset). thus, whether insulin was
added before or after the addition of amph, amph still
reduced cell-surface expression with respect to insulin treatment alone, with the resulting level of surface expression
similar to that for ctr.
incubation of hdat cells with 10 ␮m amph for 40 min
(amph) decreased [3h]da uptake to 70 ⫾ 4% of control
condition (fig. 2, u), consistent with the change in cellsurface expression shown above. application of 1 ␮m insulin
during the last 10 min of amph exposure restored [3h]da
uptake to 104 ⫾ 6% of control conditions (fig. 2, f; n ⫽ 3).
this level of uptake was significantly lower than that seen
after 10 min of 1 ␮m insulin alone (136 ⫾ 6% of control
conditions) (fig. 2, p; n ⫽ 3), which is also consistent with the
surface expression data. likewise, incubating hdat cells
with insulin for 10 min before amph application (30 min)
also led to basal levels of [3h]da uptake (98 ⫾ 4% of control
conditions, n ⫽ 4; amph alone was 66 ⫾ 10% of control
condition). in parallel experiments, neither amph nor insulin caused any significant change of [3h]glycine uptake mediated by endogenous glycine transporters, thereby demonstrating that the regulation of dat does not result from
nonspecific bulk membrane movement (data not shown).
although these offsetting effects of amph and insulin
might be achieved through different mechanisms, we hypothesized that regulation of akt activity is the common mecha-

105

nism. in hdat cells, insulin stimulation of akt activity, as
measured by phosphorylation of akt on ser473, was maximal
after 10 min and was stable up to 40 min. the density of the
immunoblot bands obtained using a ps473-akt ab increased,
respectively, to 353 ⫾ 61 and 345 ⫾ 42% of control condition
after 10 and 40 min of insulin application. in contrast, incubating hdat cells with 10 ␮m amph for 40 min (amph)
reduced phosphorylation of akt on ser473 to 20 ⫾ 4% of
control conditions (ctr) (inset). data are expressed as
mean ⫾ s.e.m. and are compared with respective controls by
two-tailed t test (p ⬍ 0.05, n ⫽ 3).
expression of constitutively active akt prevents
amph-induced reduction of hdat cell-surface expression and [3h]da uptake. akt is a pleckstrin homology
domain-containing  xxxg1377xxx . earlier reports
suggested that akt is activated upon translocation to the
plasma membrane as a consequence of its binding to phosphoinositides [e.g., phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)p3] that are
induced by insulin stimulation (elmendorf and pessin, 1999;
taha and klip, 1999). therefore, we used a membrane-targeted constitutively active akt (myrakt) (ballou et al., 2001)
to probe whether akt is part of the regulatory network required by insulin to modulate amph-induced trafficking of
hdat. hdat cells were transiently transfected with either
myrakt or vector. figure 3a shows surface biotinylated (top
lane) and total (bottom lane) protein extract of transfected
hdat cells treated with either 10 ␮m amph or vehicle for 30
min. amph caused a decrease in the amount of hdat proteins recovered in the biotinylated fraction of vector-transfected cell (fig. 3a). in contrast, in the cells transfected with
myrakt, amph did not decrease hdat cell-surface expression (fig. 3a). figure 3b shows quantification of the biotinylated bands obtained from three different experiments. in
vector (䡺) and myrakt (f)-transfected cells, amph decreased hdat cell-surface expression to 74 ⫾ 7.2 and 98 ⫾
1.7% of control conditions, respectively (fig. 3b). overexpression of myrakt did not, however, alter basal levels of hdat
plasma membrane expression (data not shown).

hdat cells were treated with either

min (amph, u), or 10 ␮m amph for

consistent with these effects on cell-surface expression, in
hdat cells transfected with the empty vector, amph reduced [3h]da uptake to 72 ⫾ 7% of control (fig. 3c, 䡺). in
contrast, expression of myrakt (fig. 3c, f) blocked the ability of amph to reduce [3h]da uptake. also consistent with
the effects on cell-surface expression, myrakt transfection
did not significantly alter [3h]da uptake with respect to
vector control (fig. 3c).
overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of
akt impairs surface expression of hdat and insulin
modulation of amph-induced hdat cell-surface redistribution. amph application decreased both hdat expression at the plasma membrane and phosphorylation of
akt on ser473 (figs. 1 and 2), suggesting that basal activity
of akt is necessary to maintain normal surface levels of dat.
therefore, we tested the effects of an akt inhibitor, ml9
(smith et al., 2000; fiory et al., 2004), originally characterized as a competitive inhibitor of a low myosin-light chain
kinase (saitoh et al., 1987) on cell-surface expression of
hdat. incubation of hdat cells with 100 ␮m ml9 for 30 min
produced a significant decrease in the level of hdat protein
recovered in the biotinylated fraction (fig. 4a). figure 4b
shows quantification of the biotinylated bands obtained from
six different experiments. in ml9-treated cells (ml9, f), the
biotinylated fraction was 72 ⫾ 6.6% of vehicle control (ctr,
䡺). consistent with these effects on surface expression, incubation of hdat cells with 100 ␮m ml9 for different time
periods (between 5 and 60 min) resulted in a time-dependent
decrease in [3h]da uptake (fig. 4c). ml9 decreased [3h]da
uptake to 74.6 ⫾ 6.1% of control conditions after 5 min of
drug application.
to assess whether insulin modulation of the amph-induced

hdat cell-surface redistribution requires akt activation, 48 h
after transfection with akt-kd or vector, hdat cells were
treated with either 10 ␮m amph for 40 min or 1 ␮m insulin for
10 min followed by 10 ␮m amph for 30 min in the continued
presence of insulin (fig. 5). figure 5a shows that upon insulin
stimulation, the amount of hdat recovered in the biotinylated
fraction is reduced in hdat cells overexpressing akt-kd with
respect to vector transfection. figure 5b shows quantification of
the biotinylated bands obtained from four different experiments. data were normalized to total protein and were expressed as a percentage of vector-transfected hdat cells
treated with amph. insulin significantly increased hdat cellsurface expression in vector-transfected cells after amph treatment (120 ⫾ 17% with respect to amph treatment alone; 䡺).
on the other hand, transfection of akt-kd blocked the insulinmediated increase in hdat plasma membrane expression after
amph treatment (f). the amount of hdat recovered in the
biotinylated fraction was not affected by transfecting hdat
cells with vector (fig. 5c, top lane, left; compare vector versus
ctr). in vector-transfected cells, plasma-membrane hdat was
107 ⫾ 3% of control condition (n ⫽ 3; p ⬎ 0.05 by two-tailed t
test). in contrast, overexpression of akt-kd in hdat cells decreased cell-surface expression of hdat (fig. 5c, top lane, right;
compare akt-kd versus vector). as in ml9- and amph-treated
cells (figs. 1 and 4), in akt-kd–transfected cells, the amount of
hdat recovered in the biotinylated fraction was 61 ⫾ 10% of
vector control condition, suggesting that basal akt activity regulates hdat cell-surface expression (n ⫽ 3; level of significance
equal to p ⬍ 0.05 by two-tailed t test).
ml9 also reduced the ability of insulin to modulate amphinduced hdat cell-surface redistribution. figure 6a shows

discussion
akt is involved in multiple cellular functions, including
growth, apoptosis (hanada et al., 2004), and glucose metabolism (george et al., 2004). our data demonstrate that akt
plays an essential role in the homeostatic regulation of hdat
activity. a pharmacological inhibitor of akt, ml9, decreased
hdat surface expression and da uptake in a time-dependent

fashion (fig. 4). similar results were obtained with a dominant-negative mutant of akt (fig. 5c). these results, for the
first time, suggest that basal akt activity maintains basal
cell-surface dat levels and thereby basal levels of da uptake.
it is not yet known whether akt activity regulates hdat
cell-surface expression, and consequently da uptake, by controlling the rate of dat exocytosis and/or its rate of endocytosis. it is known, however, that in adipocytes and muscles,
insulin induces the translocation of the intracellular glut4
glucose transporter to the plasma membrane (cheatham
and kahn, 1995) and that this translocation is mediated by
akt (elmendorf and pessin, 1999). therefore, we explored
whether the insulin modulation of the amph-induced
decrease in hdat plasma-membrane expression (fig. 1)
requires activation of akt. the insulin modulation of
amph-induced cell-surface redistribution was blocked by
overexpression of a dominant mutant of akt (fig. 5) and by
preincubation with the akt inhibitor ml9 (fig. 6). because
amph inhibits akt activity (fig. 2), these data suggest that
insulin requires activation of akt to restore normal hdat
plasma-membrane expression upon amph treatment. moreover, increasing akt activity by overexpressing the constitutively active myrakt blocked amph-induced hdat cell-surface redistribution (fig. 3b) as well as the ability of amph to
decrease da uptake (fig. 3c), suggesting a direct correlation
between insulin modulation of amph-induced hdat cellsurface redistribution and akt activity.
a well-characterized signaling event elicited by insulin is the
regulation of glucose homeostasis. in nonbrain tissue such as
skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, insulin signaling stimulates
an increase of glucose reuptake (taha and klip, 1999). although insulin crosses the blood-brain barrier (banks and kastin, 1998), neurons use insulin-independent mechanisms to obtain glucose. therefore, it is conceivable that insulin in the
central nervous system could modulate cellular processes distinct from those involved in the cellular supply and metabolism

of glucose. indeed, patterson and coworkers (1998) have shown
that insulin regulates dopaminergic neurotransmission, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. da uptake
in striatal preparations from fasted hypoinsulinemic rats was
significantly decreased compared with control rats (patterson
et al., 1998). the reduction in da uptake resulted from a decrease in transporter vmax and not from a change in the km
value for da. such a reduction in vmax is consistent with an
increased intracellular accumulation of dat in these diabetic,
insulin-deficient animals. consistent with this hypothesis and
with our data, the vmax of da uptake was restored to control
levels after incubation of striatal suspensions from fasted animals with 1 nm insulin for 30 min (patterson et al., 1998).
these data strongly suggest that changes in insulin levels in
the limbic area of the brain could affect da uptake and, consequently, extracellular da levels. it is noteworthy that no
changes in da uptake were observed in the nucleus accumbens
of food-deprived rats, suggesting that insulin selectively affects
brain regions.
amph is believed to increase extracellular da levels both
by competing with da for dat and through facilitated exchange (fischer and cho, 1979). in addition, amph has been
shown to decrease dat cell-surface expression and da uptake, which also probably contributes to an increase in extracellular da levels (saunders et al., 2000; gulley et al.,
2002; little et al., 2002; chi and reith, 2003). it is interesting
that in pharmacologically induced diabetic rats (i.e., alloxantreated), the ability of short-term administration of amph to
induce anorexia, stereotyped behavior, and increased locomotor activity was markedly attenuated, whereas subsequent
administration of insulin reversed this attenuation (marshall, 1978). likewise, galici et al. (2003) demonstrated that
in diabetic rats, amph self-administration and da uptake in
striatum were both reduced. together, these studies suggest
that insulin pathways in the brain may play an important
role in regulating dat activity, extracellular da levels, and
the actions of amph.
regulation of hdat cell-surface expression may represent
an important mechanism through which insulin signaling
modulates the dopaminergic system and the actions of
amph. in this study, we demonstrated that insulin offsets
the ability of amph to decrease hdat plasma membrane
expression and da uptake. this insulin effect did not depend
on the time at which insulin was applied (i.e., before or after
amph incubation), indicating that the amph-induced decrease in da uptake is a consequence of hdat cell-surface
redistribution rather than hdat inactivation (figs. 1 and 2).
several studies have implicated pi3k in the regulation of
trafficking and activity of the glucose and glutamate transporters (clarke et al., 1994; james and piper, 1994; davis et al.,
1998). likewise, pi3k has been shown to be essential for insulin modulation of hdat function in striatal synaptosomes and
hdat cells (carvelli et al., 2002). pi3k inhibitors, such as
 xxxd2523xxx , blocked the insulin-induced increase in da uptake
(carvelli et al., 2002). moreover, in hdat cells, overexpression
of a constitutively active mutant of pi3k increased da uptake
(carvelli et al., 2002). these data suggested that insulin signaling in general and pi3k in particular regulate da uptake, and
we have now shown that akt activation seems to be essential
for the effect of insulin on hdat. it is interesting that although
both insulin and exogenous pi3k increased basal levels of da
uptake in hdat cells (carvelli et al., 2002), overexpression of

akt regulates hdat cell-surface expression

constitutively active akt did not (fig. 3c). thus, in addition to
its effects on akt, insulin (and probably pi3k) might also regulate dat activity through another mechanism, although the
myrakt may not be sufficiently constitutively active to mimic
the effects of insulin on akt activation; therefore, akt may be
the only mechanism by which insulin affects dat cell-surface
expression.
in summary, our results demonstrate that the basal activity
of akt is essential for maintaining cell-surface expression of
hdat and that insulin modulation of amph-induced trafficking of hdat requires akt activation. our results could provide
a mechanism for hormonal regulation of drug abuse and suggest that the insulin signaling pathway, including akt, may
represent a new cellular target for substance-abuse therapies.
