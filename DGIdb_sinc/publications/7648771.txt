chlorpheniramine plasma concentration and histamine h1-receptor occupancy.  the plasma concentration-response relationship of the antihistamine chlorpheniramine is poorly characterized. this study examined concurrently the concentrations of chlorpheniramine and presence of h1-receptor antagonist in plasma after administration of 8 mg chlorpheniramine in normal volunteers. six extensive metabolizers and five poor metabolizers, as judged by cyp2d6 phenotype (dextromethorphan metabolic ratio), were enrolled in the study. more than 80% occupancy of h1-receptors by antagonist in plasma was observed for 12 hours after the dose in extensive metabolizers and greater than 60% from 12 to 30 hours in poor metabolizers, when plasma concentrations had fallen below those that should result in 50% occupancy of receptors. the results suggest that (+/-)-chlorpheniramine plasma concentrations do not predict h1-receptor antagonist in plasma. in addition, a role is suggested for cyp2d6 in formation of a potent active metabolite of chlorpheniramine.
