abstract
aripiprazole is a novel antipsychotic drug, which displays partial agonist activity at the  xxxg656xxx . aripiprazole has been
extensively studied pre-clinically, both in vitro and in vivo, and these results have been correlated with clinical findings. however, aripiprazole is
metabolised differently in rats and man and these metabolites may contribute to the profile of aripiprazole observed in vivo. we have therefore
studied the interaction of aripiprazole and its principal rat and human metabolites in both in vitro models of dopamine hd2 receptor function and
affinity, and of in vivo models of dopamine rat  xxxg656xxx  function. the human metabolite displayed similar levels of partial agonist activity to
aripiprazole at the dopamine hd2 receptor and displayed similar behavioural profile to aripiprazole in vivo, suggesting that in man the metabolite
may maintain the effects of aripiprazole. in contrast, the rat metabolite displayed antagonist activity both in vitro and in vivo. thus care must be
taken in ascribing effects seen in vivo with aripiprazole in rats to  xxxg656xxx  partial agonist activity in man, and that care must also be
taken in extrapolating effects seen in rats to man, particularly from long-term studies.

1. introduction
aripiprazole has recently been launched as an antipsychotic
agent with a pharmacological profile different from that of other
currently available antipsychotic drugs. aripiprazole has a partial
agonist activity at 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)1a receptors and
antagonist activity at 5-ht2a receptors, but unlike other
antipsychotic drugs, aripiprazole displays potent partial agonist
activity at the  xxxg656xxx  (lawler et al., 1999; shapiro
et al., 2003). aripiprazole is a clinically effective antipsychotic
drug with a low incidence of side-effects including minimal shortterm weight gain, low liability for inducing movement disorders,
and reductions (rather than elevations) in plasma prolactin levels
(potkin et al., 2003; kasper et al., 2003). indeed, it has been
suggested that it is the partial agonist property of aripiprazole at

the  xxxg656xxx  which is responsible for its low incidence of movement disorders and no significant increase in
serum prolactin levels (aihara et al., 2004). further it has been
suggested that the low propensity of aripiprazole to induce weight
gain may be due to the relatively low affinity for the histamine h1
receptor (kroeze et al., 2003). this has led to the claim that the
mechanism of action of aripiprazole predicts both clinical efficacy
and a reduced side-effect profile (hirose et al., 2003).
in many of these studies, interpretation has been based on a
comparison between in vivo and in vitro data. for example,
partial agonist activity of aripiprazole on prolactin release from a
rat pituitary cell line expressing the human  xxxg656xxx 
has been linked to a lack of effect on serum prolactin in the clinic
(aihara et al., 2004). similarly, the  xxxg656xxx  partial
agonist activity of aripiprazole in vitro may explain the low
liability to induce catalepsy in rats which may relate to the low
incidence of extra pyramidal side-effects (hirose et al., 2003).
however, such correlations between in vitro and in vivo studies

and across species, are confounded by the extensive metabolism
of aripiprazole and the fact that different metabolites may be
formed in rodents compared to man. indeed, aripiprazole is
extensively metabolised by the hepatic  xxxg590xxx  and
2d6 systems (mcgavin and goa, 2002). in humans the active
metabolite opc-14857 (table 1) is formed from dehydrogenation
of aripiprazole (citrome et al., 2005) and represents around 39%
of total drug levels at steady state. in rodents a different metabolite, the 4-hydroxy phenylpiperazine dm-1451 (table 1), is
formed (morita et al., 1998; lawler et al., 1999). although there is
some limited data on the pharmacological profile of these
metabolites, there has not been a systematic evaluation of their
effects using in vitro and in vivo models. in order to understand
further the pharmacological properties of aripiprazole and how
these may extend to therapeutic effects in man, we have profiled
the human and rat metabolites of aripiprazole and compared them
with those of aripiprazole itself. we have compared their pharmacological profile in a number of in vivo and in vitro models
which report agonist and antagonist properties at the dopamine d2
receptor.
2. materials and methods
2.1. materials
biochemical reagents including leupeptin, bacitracin, pmsf,
pepstatin, edta, polyethylene imine (pei),  xxxd3449xxx , hepes
buffer, gdp and n-methyl-d-glucamine (nmdg) were purchased from sigma (poole, uk). drugs including quinpirole,
 xxxd2637xxx , mesulergine, haloperidol, (s)-(−)3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-n-propylpiperidine ((−)3-ppp) and methiothepin were
purchased from sigma-rbi. the following radioligands were
used: [ 3 h]- xxxd2419xxx  (perkin elmer, 70 ci/mmol), [3 h]mesulergine (amersham, 80 ci/mmol), [3 h]-lysergic acid
diethylamide (lsd, amersham, 70 ci/mmol), [3h]-flb-457

membranes were prepared from either sh-sy5y cells
stably expressing either human (h) 5-ht2a or h5-ht2c cloned
receptors, hela cells stably expressing h5-ht6 cloned
receptors, and chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells stably
expressing dopamine hd2(short) or hd3 cloned receptors as
follows. the cell pellets were suspended in 10 vol. of buffer
(50 mm hepes, 1 mm edta, 1 mum leupeptin, 20 mug/ml
bacitracin, 1 mm pmsf and 1 mum pepstatin a, ph 7.4) and
homogenised by two 15 s bursts in a glass waring blender. the
cell suspension was centrifuged at 500 g for 20 min at 4 °c and
the resultant supernatant centrifuged at 48,000 g for 30 min at
4 °c. the resultant membrane pellet was then resuspended in
buffer using a vortex mixer and dounce homogeniser and 1 ml
aliquots of membranes stored at − 80 °c until required for
assay.
test compounds were dissolved in dimethylsuphoxide to a
concentration of 10 mm. from this stock, compounds were diluted
(half log serial dilutions) in 5 mm hcl. compounds were then
incubated in the presence of appropriate membranes and radioligand for 45 min at 37 °c. the following radioligands were used
to determine affinity of aripiprazole and its metabolites at test
receptors; 1 nm [3h]- xxxd2419xxx  (5-ht2a receptors), 1 nm [3h]mesulergine (5-ht2c receptors), 1 nm [3h]-lsd ( xxxg1119xxx  receptors), 0.2 nm [3h]-flb-457 (dopamine d2 and d3 receptors).
non-specific binding was determined using 10 mum of the
following compounds;  xxxd2637xxx  (5-ht2a receptors), mesulergine
(5-ht2c receptors), methiothepin ( xxxg1119xxx  receptors), haloperidol
(dopamine d2 and d3 receptors). assays were terminated by rapid
filtration through gf/b filters pre-soaked in 0.3% pei, followed
by 5 × 1 ml washes with ice cold 50 mm  xxxd3449xxx  (ph 7.4).
bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation spectrometry.
data were analysed using 4 parameter logistic curve fitting
(prism) to determine ic50 values which were converted to ki
values using the cheng prusoff equation (ki = ic50/ (1+ [ligand]/
kd)). all data are the means with standard error from at least 3
separate experiments and the data expressed as pki.
2.3. [35s]-gtpgammas binding studies
membranes were prepared from cho cells stably expressing
dopamine hd2(s) receptors as follows. cell pellets were
suspended in 20 vol. of 20 mm hepes, 10 mm edta buffer
(ph 7.4). the suspension was homogenised by two 15 s bursts
of an ultra-turrax homogeniser before being centrifuged at
18,500 rpm for 15 min at 4 °c. the supernatant was discarded
and the pellet resuspended in 20 vol. of 20 mm hepes, 0.1 mm
edta buffer (ph 7.4). the suspension was homogenised and

centrifuged as before. the resultant pellet was resuspended and
stored in 1 ml aliquots at − 80 °c until required for assay.
test compounds were dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide to a
concentration of 10 mm. from this stock, compounds were
diluted (half log serial dilutions) in assay buffer (20 mm hepes,
10 mm mgcl2, 5 mm nacl, 95 mm nmdg, ph 7.4).
compounds were incubated with membranes in the presence
of 10 mum gdp for 30 min at 30 °c. non-specific binding was
determined using 20 mum unlabelled gtpgammas. 1 nm [35s]-gtpgammas
(final assay concentration 100 pm) was then added to each assay
well, followed by a further 30 min incubation at 30 °c. the assay
was terminated by rapid filtration through whatman gf/b filters
pre-soaked in h2o, followed by 5 × 1 ml washes with ice cold

rats' forelimbs remained on the bar was recorded up to 2 min.
the rats were judged to be cataleptic if they maintained that
position for 30 s or more at the third time of testing. after
discarding the haloperidol data, catalepsy for the investigational
compounds was analysed by logistic regression analysis in
statistica 6 (statsoft inc.). trunk blood was then collected and
centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm. supernatant was decanted
and assayed for prolactin by radioimmunoassay using the
biotrak prolactin assay from amersham biosciences. data
were analysed by graphpad prism and in the event of doserelated changes in prolactin levels. ed50 was determined using
statistica 6 (statsoft inc.). these studies were conducted in
compliance with the home office guidance on the operation of
the uk animals (scientific procedures) act 1986, and was
reviewed and approved by the glaxosmithkline procedures
review panel.

male sprague dawley rats were obtained from charles river
and weighed 203–289 g on the day of test. aripiprazole, or its
metabolites, were ground in 1%  xxxd2609xxx  to form a
suspension. 1%  xxxd2609xxx  (2 ml/kg p.o.) or aripiprazole or
its metabolites (3.2–100 mg/kg, 2 ml/kg p.o.) were administered
by gavage. thirty minutes later, rats were placed in amlogger activity monitors (linton instruments) and allowed to
habituate for 30 min. rats were then administered saline (1 ml/
kg s.c.) or dexamphetamine sulphate (0.4 mg/kg free base, 1 ml/
kg s.c.) and their activity monitored for a further 60 min. after
discarding the first 5 min to minimise handling artefacts, the total
counts for the final 55 min were analysed using statistica 6
(statsoft inc.). scatterplots of the data were examined to see
whether there was a linear relationship between means and
standard deviations and cross-checked using the bartlett chisquared test. if there was a linear relationship, the data were log
or square root transformed to ensure homogeneity of variance
and then analysed by single factor anova and post hoc
dunnett's multiple comparison procedure. if there was an
orderly dose-related effect, a dose response curve was fitted to
the percent transformed data and an ed50 was calculated. these
studies were conducted in compliance with the home office
guidance on the operation of the uk animals (scientific
procedures) act 1986, and was reviewed and approved by the
glaxosmithkline procedures review panel.

the effect of drug treatments in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6ohda)-lesioned model was performed according to henry et
al. (1998) with all reagents obtained from sigma unless
otherwise stated. male sprague–dawley rats weighing 290–
350 g were housed in a temperature-controlled room under a
12 h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. thirty
minutes prior to surgery, animals were injected intraperitoneally
with  xxxd2850xxx  (5 mg/kg) and desipramine (25 mg/kg). rats
were then placed in a stereotactic frame under general
anaesthesia (fluorothane). each animal received a unilateral
injection of 2.5 mul 6-ohda hbr (conc. = 5 mg/ml in sterile
water with 0.1%  xxxd228xxx , i.e. 12.5 mug 6-ohda per rat)
into the right medial forebrain bundle at co-ordinates − 2.8 mm
from bregma, 2 mm lateral to the midline, and 9 mm below the
skull according to the atlas of paxinos and watson. the rats
were allowed to recover for 3 weeks following the lesion.
animals then received 0.05 mg/kg s.c. apomorphine to assess
the extent of lesion with only lesioned animals being used in the
study (as determined by apomorphine rotation). rats were then
treated with test compound and rotational behaviour was
assessed for 2 h using automated rotometers. data were
analysed independently for each drug with a parametric oneway repeated measures analysis of variance (anova) followed

after aripiprazole and metabolites and 60, 90 and 120 min after
haloperidol (positive control). the behaviour was measured by
placing the rats' forelimbs over a horizontal metal bar (1 cm in

results are shown in table 2. the rat and human metabolite

in antagonist studies, the rat metabolite blocked the response
to quinpirole with a pa2 of 8.80 with a slope factor of 1.1
(n = 3).
3.3. amphetamine-induced locomotor activity
data for aripiprazole and its rat metabolite required natural
log transformation, and data for the human metabolite required
square root transformation. both aripiprazole and its human
metabolite inhibited the increase in locomotor activity induced
by 0.4 mg/kg amphetamine, with both displaying significant
effects at the lowest dose tested (3.2 mg/kg, p.o.; fig. 2). in
contrast, the rat metabolite at doses up to 100 mg/kg had no
significant effect on amphetamine-induced locomotor activity.
it should be noted that the difference in amphetamine response
across experiments was due to differences in test apparatus
used.
3.4. induction of catalepsy and increases in prolactin
vehicle treatment (1%  xxxd2609xxx ) failed to produce
significant catalepsy up to 4 h later, whereas haloperidol (2.8 mg/
kg p.o.) produced catalepsy in most of the rats tested (fig. 3).
neither aripiprazole, its rat metabolite or its human metabolite
produced significant catalepsy at doses up to 100 mg/kg p.o.
serum prolactin levels after vehicle treatment were 5–15 ng/
ml. haloperidol (2.8 mg/kg p.o.) significantly increased serum
prolactin levels to 40 ng/ml or higher (fig. 4). both aripiprazole
and its human metabolite had no or inconsistent effects on
serum prolactin levels, whereas the rat metabolite produced a
marked dose-related increase in serum prolactin levels achieving similar levels to that seen with haloperidol (fig. 4).

(−)3-ppp (0.32–3.2 mg/kg; s.c.) elicited significant rotational activity during the 0–2 h time period post-administration,
as compared to vehicle (fig. 5). total net contraversive rotations
cumulated over the duration of the experiment were 344 ± 96
and 414 ± 78 for 1 mg/kg and 3.2 mg/kg, respectively (both
p b 0.01). (−)3-ppp administered at 0.32 mg/kg elicited 164 ± 67
total net contraversive rotations but this did not reach statistical
significance.
aripiprazole (1–10 mg/kg; p.o.) elicited no significant
rotational activity during the 1–3 h time period post-administration, as compared to vehicle (fig. 5). similarly there was no
significant change in rotational activity following administration
of the rat metabolite (3.2 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 32 mg/kg; p.o.). in
contrast,  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg p.o., the human metabolite of aripiprazole
produced a small but significant increase in net contraversive
rotations during the 0–2 h time period post-administration
(fig. 5).
4. discussion
aripiprazole is a novel drug for the treatment of schizophrenia with a unique mechanism of action, namely dopamine
 xxxg656xxx  partial agonist activity. this mechanism of action
has been claimed to predict its clinical efficacy and favourable
side-effect profile (hirose et al., 2003) and was based on
correlations between clinical findings in humans and preclinical studies in rodents. aripiprazole is extensively metabolised in both species, but the predominant metabolites are
different between rat and human. the major finding of the
present study is that whereas the human metabolite (opc14857) is a  xxxg656xxx  partial agonist similar to
aripiprazole, the rat metabolite (dm-1451) is a dopamine d2
receptor antagonist.
in radioligand binding studies, aripiprazole and its metabolites exhibited similar profiles although the rat metabolite
displayed a higher affinity for the dopamine d2 and d3 receptors.
in functional in vitro studies, aripiprazole displays both agonist
and antagonist properties (shapiro et al., 2003): it is a partial
agonist on prolactin release from rat pituitary slices (inoue et al.,
1996), on adenylyl cyclase activity in gh4 cells (aihara et al.,
2004) and on camp levels in hek-293 and cho cells (shapiro
et al., 2003) but is an antagonist on k+-currents in mes-23.5
cells and on [35s]-gtpgammas binding in cho cells (shapiro et al.,
2003). in the present study, using a cho cell line which
expresses the human dopamine d2short receptor (1.2 pmol/mg,
wilson et al., 2001), aripiprazole was a potent, low-efficacy
partial agonist. in the same assay conditions, the human metabolite showed a similar pharmacological profile but appeared
more potent, whereas the rat metabolite was devoid of intrinsic
activity and therefore appeared as a silent antagonist. this is in
agreement with the functional studies on aripiprazole (opc14597) and its rat metabolite (dm-1451) at the rat dopamine d2l
receptor expressed in c-6 cells (lawler et al., 1999). in these
studies, aripiprazole acted as partial agonist whereas dm-1451
lacked agonist activity. in addition, it should be noted that

m.d. wood et al. / european journal of pharmacology 546 (2006) 88–94

aripiprazole and its metabolites displayed high affinity for the
human  xxxg1113xxx  but only moderate affinity for the
human  xxxg1115xxx  and the human  xxxg1119xxx .
in vivo, aripiprazole was a potent inhibitor of amphetamineinduced increases in locomotor activity suggesting that it acts
predominantly as a  xxxg656xxx  antagonist. the
human metabolite displayed a similar pharmacological profile,
but again appeared more potent. surprisingly, the rat metabolite
was inactive in this model. neither aripiprazole nor its
metabolites induced cataleptic behaviour in the rat, a behaviour
which is indicative of  xxxg656xxx  blockade. it should
be noted that in a previous study, cataleptic behaviour was seen
with aripiprazole in wistar rats (kikuchi et al., 1995) although
catalepsy was only seen at doses 10–20 fold higher than those
which blocked apomorphine-induced stereotypy. these results
are in agreement with kleven et al. (2005) who also saw no
cataleptic behaviour in sprague–dawley rats with aripiprazole.
this lack of cataleptic behaviour in atypical antipsychotic drugs
may be due to their  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist properties (see
reavill et al., 1999) or  xxxg1108xxx  agonist properties (see
kleven et al., 2005). however, aripiprazole and its metabolites
display a marked difference in binding affinity between the
dopamine d2 and 5-ht2c receptors, being 10 fold lower at the 5ht2c receptor. the study of kleven et al. suggested that the lack
of catalepsy was not due to agonist properties of aripiprazole at
the  xxxg1108xxx . this suggests that the lack of cataleptic
behaviour seen with aripiprazole may be due to its partial agonist
properties at the  xxxg656xxx .
interestingly, whilst aripiprazole and its human metabolite
produced small elevations in prolactin levels, the rat metabolite
of aripiprazole caused a marked elevation in blood prolactin.
dopamine is released from the median eminence of the
hypothalamus into the pituitary portal blood. dopamine is
known to inhibit tonically prolactin release via activation of
dopamine d2 receptors in lactotroph cells (ben-johnathan and
hnasko, 2001) and dopamine receptor blockade removes this
inhibition causing an increase in prolactin release. aripiprazole
has been reported to produce a small but significant increase in
serum prolactin levels (inoue et al., 1996), in agreement with the
present findings. these results suggest that the lack of a marked
effect of aripiprazole and its human metabolite on prolactin
levels may be due to the low-level of partial agonist activity at
the  xxxg656xxx . the marked effect seen with the rat
metabolite is consistent with its antagonist activity and suggests
that the lack of activity against amphetamine-induced locomotor
activity may be due to poor brain penetration. in the 6-ohda
contralateral turning model, although the human metabolite
produced a small response, the results suggest that all three
compounds lack agonist activity at the denervation-induced
supersensitive  xxxg656xxx , in agreement with the
previous studies using aripiprazole (kikuchi et al., 1995).
it has been suggested that the pharmacological profile of
aripiprazole may be due to functional selectivity rather than partial
agonist activity (shapiro et al., 2003; urban et al., 2006). the
phenomenon of functional selectivity suggests that a ligand acting
at a single g protein-coupled receptor causes dissimilar degrees of
activation for different effector pathways. thus aripiprazole acted

93

as a potent partial agonist for the potentiation of  xxxd208xxx 
release, was a weak partial agonist vs mapk phosphorylation
and did not induce receptor internalisation (urban et al., 2006).
however, the present results can be simply explained by partial
agonist activity with an efficacy of greater 0.2 required before
activity is seen in the 6-ohda contralateral turning model, whilst
compounds with an efficacy of 0.2 do show agonist like effects on
prolactin release. in order to distinguish between partial agonist
activity and functional selectivity, a number of agonists would
need to be profiled and for functional selectivity it may be
predicted that a different rank order of potency would be seen.
with the limited data set available it is not possible to distinguish
between these two models.
in conclusion, this study confirms the partial agonist properties of aripiprazole both in vivo and in vitro. it also suggests
that in man the effects of aripiprazole may be maintained by its
active metabolite (opc-14857) which displays similar properties to aripiprazole but is more potent. in the rat, the properties of
aripiprazole may be confounded by its active metabolite (dm1451) which displays antagonist properties, although it may
show a reduced propensity to cross the blood–brain barrier. in
this respect, aripiprazole acts as an agonist at the dopamine d2
receptor in slices of rat anterior pituitary to decrease spontaneous
prolactin release (inoue et al., 1996). therefore the slight
elevation in prolactin levels observed in vivo may reflect the
action of the rat metabolite. this would not be expected in man
where the metabolite should reinforce the partial agonist actions
of aripiprazole rather than counter them. indeed, in clinical trials
in human patients, aripiprazole significantly reduced prolactin
levels (mcgavin and goa, 2002). these results also confirm that
the unique profile of aripiprazole with respect to low
extrapyramidal side-effect liability with reduced prolactin levels
reflects its partial agonist activity at the  xxxg656xxx 
(hirose et al., 2003).
