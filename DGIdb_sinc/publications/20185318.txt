a series of phenolic acids and phenol natural products, such as p-hydroxybenzoic acid, p- xxxd1756xxx ,
 xxxd403xxx , ferulic acid, gallic acid, syringic acid, quercetin, and  xxxd1979xxx , were investigated for their
inhibitory effects against the metalloenzyme carbonic anhydrase (ca,  xxxg287xxx   xxxg290xxx   xxxg292xxx   xxxg293xxx   xxxg294xxx   xxxg295xxx   xxxg296xxx   xxxg297xxx   xxxg298xxx   xxxg299xxx   xxxg301xxx ). all mammalian isozymes of human (h) or murine (m) origin hca i–hca xii, mca xiii and hca xiv were inhibited in the
low micromolar or submicromolar range by these (poly)phenols (kis in the range of 0.87–7.79 lm).
p-hydroxybenzoic acid was the best inhibitor of all isozymes (kis of 0.87–35.4 lm) and the different
isozymes showed very variable inhibition proﬁles with these derivatives. phenols like the ones investigated here possess a ca inhibition mechanism distinct of that of the sulfonamides/sulfamates used clinically or the coumarins. unlike the sulfonamides, which bind to the catalytic zinc ion, phenols are
anchored at the zn(ii)-coordinated water molecule and bind more externally within the active site cavity,
making contacts with various amino acid residues. as this is the region with the highest variability
between the many ca isozymes found in mammals, this class of compounds may lead to isoform-selective inhibitors targeting just one or few of the medicinally relevant cas.

1. introduction
phenols were recently investigated1–4 in detail as inhibitors of the
zinc enzyme carbonic anhydrase (ca,  xxxg287xxx   xxxg290xxx   xxxg292xxx   xxxg293xxx   xxxg294xxx   xxxg295xxx   xxxg296xxx   xxxg297xxx   xxxg298xxx   xxxg299xxx   xxxg301xxx ).5 cas, of which 16
isoforms are presently known in mammals,5 are inhibited by three
main mechanisms: (i) coordination of the inhibitor to the zn(ii) ion
(critical for catalysis) from the enzyme active site by replacing the
zinc-bound water/hydroxide ion and leading to a tetrahedral geometry of zn(ii) (fig. 1a), or by addition of the inhibitor to the metal
coordination sphere, when the zn(ii) ion is in a trigonal bipyramidal
geometry (fig. 1b);5,6 (ii) by anchoring of the inhibitor to the zn(ii)bound solvent molecule, that is, a water or hydroxide ion. phenols7
and polyamines8 bind in this way, as shown schematically in figure 1c for phenol; or (iii) by occlusion of the entrance to the active
site cavity,9 when the inhibitors bind in the activator binding region
from the ca active site.10–12 coumarins9 and lacosamide13 bind in
this way to, as shown schematically in figure 1d. it should be noted
that passing from the ﬁrst type of inhibitors (the classical ones, that
is, sulfonamides and their bioisosteres such as sulfamates, sulfamides, etc.) mentioned above to the last ones, the role of the zn(ii)
ion is constantly diminishing in its interaction with the inhibitor.

this has important consequences for the drug design of ca inhibitors
(cais) because the bottom of the active site cavity is very much conserved in the 16 ca isozymes described so far in mammals,5,6
whereas the regions with the highest variation in amino acid
sequence and as a consequence with the highest degree of structural
diversity are just those at the entrance of the active site. indeed, phenols,1–4 but also coumarins9 and other types of non-zinc binder
inhibitors8 were recently shown to lead to isozyme-selective cais,
a goal very difﬁcultly achievable with the classical sulfonamide/sulfamate inhibitors.5,6
exploration of novel chemotypes belonging to the phenol class is
thus constantly being pursued in our laboratories,1 in the search of
interesting leads. indeed, the cais have applications in the design
of various pharmacological agents, such as diuretics,5,14 antiglaucoma,5,14–16 or anticonvulsant agents,5,15–18 whereas more recent drug
design studies evidenced some other classes of such derivatives as
molecules of interest for developing novel therapies for obesity18
and cancer5,19–22 based on selective inhibition of ca isozymes
involved in such pathologies. continuing our earlier work in the ﬁeld
of phenols as possible cais, we report here an inhibition study of the
12 catalytically active mammalian isozymes ca i–xiv with a panel of
phenols and polyphenols, some of which are natural products.
several low micromolar and submicromolar cais have been thus
detected which represent interesting new leads for obtaining even
tighter binding compounds.

2. results and discussion
2.1. chemistry
we used phenol 1 and pyrocatechol 2 as lead compounds, as
they have been investigated earlier2 for their interaction with isoforms ca i–xiv and provided noteworthy results. as stressed in the
introduction, these compounds possess a mechanism of enzyme
inhibition quite distinct from that of sulfonamides,5 clinically used
cais, such as acetazolamide 3, which has been included in our
study for comparison reasons.

inhibition data against all the catalytically active mammalian aca isozymes, that is, ca i, ii, iii, iv, va, vb, vi, vii, ix, xii, xiii and
xiv with compounds 1–11 are presented in table 1, and they were
obtained at ph 7.4 in 10 mm hepes buffer, at 25 °c, by a stoppedﬂow assay monitoring the co2 hydration reaction.27 the sulfonamide 3 (and previously investigated phenols 1 and 2)2 inhibition
data are also shown for comparison reasons in table 1.
the following should be noted regarding the inhibition of these

(i) against isozyme hca i phenols 4–11 exhibited excellent
inhibitory activity, with inhibition constants in the range of
0.92–4.15 lm, being more effective than the simple phenol
1 (ki of 10.2 lm) or pyrocatechol 2 (which is a very ineffective
hca i inhibitor, with a ki of 4 mm).2 the best inhibitors were phydroxybenzoic acid 4 and p- xxxd1756xxx  5, whereas the
least effective ones gallic acid 8 and syringic acid 9. thus, small
structural changes in the molecules of these phenols have
important consequences for their potency as hca i inhibitors.

cluded in this study together with quercetin 10 and  xxxd1979xxx  11,
compounds with a more complicated scaffold which are bioactive
polyphenols that were reported to possess antioxidant and antiinﬂammatory activities.26 these last two derivatives share some
structural similarity with the xanthone 12, endiandrin a 13 and
( )-dihydroguaiaretic acid 14, natural compounds also possessing
phenolic moieties grafted on a more complex organic scaffold, and
signiﬁcant ca inhibitory activity, as recently reported by davis et al.1
thus, all these compounds have been included in this study for
at least two reasons: (i) the simple scaffolds 4–9 have not been
investigated earlier for their interaction with ca isozymes, even
if they possess structural elements found in potent and selective
cais (such as the 2-hydroxycinnamic acids),9 whereas the natural
product phenols derivatives 10 and 11 possessing more complicated scaffolds might mimic in a way the investigated derivatives
12–141 which showed nanomolar and selective inhibition of the
mitochondrial isozymes ca va and ca vb;1 and (ii) many of the
natural products phenols/polyphenols 5–11 possess signiﬁcant
biological activity, some of their derivatives being in clinical evaluation as antioxidant, antitumor or antibacterial agents, even if
their targets are largely unknown at the moment.23b–26

we decided to investigate mono- and polyphenols which possess various side chains in their molecules, such as the simple phydroxybenzoic acid 4 but also the natural products p-coumaric
acid (one of the predominant phenolic acids acylating the cell walls
of grasses)23 5, caffeic acid24 6 and ferulic acid 7,24 which possess
one or two phenolic oh groups and the ethenyl-carboxy moiety
found in 2- xxxd1756xxx , a cai recently discovered by
our group9 which has been shown by means of x-ray crystallography to bind in a completely new manner to the enzyme active site,9
as represented schematically in figure 1d.
gallic acid 8 and its bis-methylated derivative syringic acid 9, naturally occurring polyphenols widespread in plants,25 were also in-

for example, the incorporation of the p-carboxy moiety in
phenol 1, leads to 4 which is a 11 times more potent inhibitor
compared to the lead 1. introduction of the carboxyethenyl
moiety (again in para) leads to a 9.5 times increase of the
inhibitory potency of 5 over 1. however a second oh phenolic
moiety in meta (as in 6) or its methylation (as in 7) lead to a
decrease of the inhibitory power of these derivatives over
the lead 5. the more complex polyphenols 10 (pentaphenol)
and 11 (tetraphenol) were on the other hand effective hca i
inhibitors, with kis of 2.32–2.68 lm. only acetazolamide 3
was slightly a better hca i inhibitor compared to the investigated phenols (ki of 0.25 lm).

(ii) the physiologically dominant5 isozyme hca ii was also
effectively inhibited by compounds 4–11, with kis in the
range of 0.87–3.19 lm. the structure–activity relationship
(sar) is rather similar to what outlined above for hca i (also
because the two enzymes have a high sequence homology of
amino acid present within the active site).5 thus, p-hydroxybenzoic acid 4 and p- xxxd1756xxx  5 were the best inhibitors in this series of investigated compounds (kis of 0.87–
0.98 lm), being 6.3–11.4 times more effective hca ii inhibitors compared to the leads 1 and 2. the activity was then
slightly diminishing for derivatives 6–11 (kis of 1.61–
3.19 lm) as for the activity of the same derivatives against
hca i, but overall hca ii was more sensitive to these derivatives compared to hca i (although the difference in activity
is not so high). acetazolamide 3 was a very effective, nanomolar inhibitor of hca ii (ki of 12 nm).
(iii) isoform hca iii, which is not inhibited by sulfonamides28 (3
has a ki of 200 lm) is sensitive to phenol inhibition. indeed,
phenol 1 and pyrocatechol 2 are much better hca iii inhibitors
than acetazolamide (kis of 2.7–13.0 lm). the phenols 4–11
investigated here also inhibited hca iii (kis in the range of
6.61–11.1 lm), being thus less effective compared to 1 and
having activities better or in the same range as pyrocatechol
2. the best hca iii inhibitors were p-hydroxybenzoic acid 4
and gallic acid 8 (kis of 6.61–7.49 lm). compounds 5, 9 and
10 also showed kis <10 lm, whereas the least effective hca
iii inhibitors were  xxxd403xxx  6, ferrulic acid 7 and  xxxd1979xxx 
11 (kis of 10.0–11.1 lm). again small structural changes inﬂuence signiﬁcantly the inhibitory activity (compare for example 4 and 7 which differ by a meo and ch@ch moieties,
whereas their inhibitory activity differs by a factor of 1.7).
(iv) the membrane-associated isoform hca iv was moderately
inhibited by all phenols 4–11, with inhibition constants in
the range of 7.78–10.8 lm, in the same range as the leads
1 and 2 (kis of 9.5–10.9 lm). thus, sar is rather ﬂat in the
case of this isoform, as all these derivatives show a limited
variation of their potency in inhibiting hca iv (a situation
quite different from that of hca i and ii).
(v) the ﬁrst mitochondrial isoform, hca va, was quite poorly
inhibited by the simple phenols 1 and 2 (kis of 55.1–
218 lm)2 but quite effectively inhibited by the (poly) phenols 4–11 investigated here, with kis in the range of 3.67–
7.59 lm (table 1). the best inhibitors were again p-hydroxybenzoic acid 4 and gallic acid 8 (kis of 3.67–4.08 lm). thus,
there is an increase of inhibitory potency of 53.4–59.4 times
of these two derivatives over the simple phenol 1, which is
indeed a very signiﬁcant ﬁnding. sar is also here rather ﬂat,
with all these derivatives showing kis <7.6 lm. thus, polyphenols, unlike simple phenols are indeed good leads to
obtain potent hca va inhibitors. indeed, recently davis
et al.1 identiﬁed phenols 12–14 as potent hca va inhibitors,
with kis <100 nm.
(vi) also the second mitochondrial isoform, hca vb, was inhibited by compounds 4–11 investigated here, but its inhibition
proﬁle was rather different from that of hca va (with which
it shares a high degree of sequence homology).29 thus, phenols 4–8 and 10, 11 were medium potency inhibitors, with
kis in the range of 7.13–12.7 lm, whereas syringic acid 9
was much less effective (ki of 35.4 lm). it is interesting to
note the 3.5 times difference of inhibitory activity between
8 and 9, which differ only by the bis-methylation of the meta
diphenolic moieties of syringic acid. thus, sar is rather sensitive to small structural changes in the molecule of the
inhibitor in the case of this isoform, which is very different
from the situation discussed above for hca va.

(vii) similarly to hca va discussed above, the secreted (in saliva
and milk)5 isoform hca vi was effectively inhibited by all
(poly)phenols 4–11 (kis in the range of 5.70–8.45 lm),
although the simple phenols 1 and 2 were highly ineffective
as inhibitors of hca vi (kis of 208–606 lm). sar was again
quite ﬂat, with the best inhibitor being p-hydroxybenzoic
acid 4 (ki of 5.70 lm) and the worst one ferulic acid 7 (ki
of 8.45 lm). the sulfonamide 3 was a much more effective
hca vi inhibitor (ki of 11 nm) compared to all phenols investigated to date (table 1).
(viii) as for hca va and hca vi, the simple phenols 1 and 2 are
ineffective inhibitors of the cytosolic isoform hca vii (kis
of 710–714 lm), but the phenolic carboxylic acids 4–9 and
the natural products 10 and 11 effectively inhibited it, with
kis in the range of 4.08–7.81 lm. the sar is very ﬂat also in
this case, a situation we recently observed for at least two
classes of cais: the natural products investigated by davis
et al.1 for the inhibition of hca i, ii, va and vb, and a class
of sugar sulfonamides reported by lopez et al.30 in the last
case, a detailed x-ray crystal structure study of several
adducts of hca ii with some of the reported sulfonamides,
explained why such a ﬂat sar has been observed. indeed,
all the investigated compounds of lopez et al.30 inhibited
several ca isozymes in the range of 3.7–4.9 lm. the x-ray
crystal structures showed four of the structurally very different s-glycosyl primary sulfonamides to bind within the ca ii
active site cavity, but with few favorable interactions
between moieties present in the inhibitor molecule and
amino acid residues from the active site being evidenced.30
(ix) the two transmembrane, tumor-associated isozymes hca ix
and xii were also effectively inhibited by (poly)phenols 4–
11, with kis in the range of 3.73–9.87 lm for hca ix, and of
6.27–10.1 lm for hca xii, respectively. thus, for hca ix the
newly investigated phenols are more effective inhibitors than
the leads 1 and 2, whereas for hca xii the inhibitory power is
in the same range as for 1, 2, with only 4 and 8 being more
effective hca xii inhibitors compared to the leads 1, 2 and
the remaining investigated phenols. as these isozymes are
overexpressed in hypoxic tumors where there are also reactive oxygen species damaging the tissue,31 the inhibition of
these isoforms with compounds such phenols 4–11 also possessing antioxidant activity might be of interest to be studied
in more details.
(x) the cytosolic isoform mca xiii showed an inhibition proﬁle
with phenols 4–11 rather similar to hca iii. indeed, these compounds showed kis in the range of 7.79–12.2 lm, whereas the
lead 1 was a very ineffective inhibitor (ki of 697 lm). thus, the
presence of additional substituents on the aromatic ring, as in
pyrocatechol 2 and derivatives 4–11, strongly enhances the
inhibitory activity of these phenols compared to 1. for example, the incorporation of a p-cooh moiety in the molecule of
phenol 1, as in 4, leads to a 89.5 times increase of mca xiii
inhibitory activity. however, the sulfonamide 3 was the most
effective inhibitor among the investigated compounds, with a
ki of 17 nm (table 1).
(xi) the last transmembrane isoform, hca xiv (which shows a
high degree of homology with ca ix and xii)20c exhibited
an inhibition proﬁle with compounds 4–11 rather similar
to that of hca ix discussed above. thus, all the investigated
(poly)phenols were effective inhibitors with kis in the range
of 6.16–9.43 lm and thus a rather ﬂat sar. they were anyhow better inhibitors than the lead 1 (ki of 11.5 lm) and
especially pyrocatechol 2 (ki of 48.9 lm). however, again
the sulfonamide 3 was the most effective inhibitor among
the investigated compound (ki of 41 nm).

a last aspect that we investigated here is related to the inhibition
mechanism of these derivatives. thus, p- xxxd1756xxx  5 is an isomer
with 2- xxxd1756xxx  that we showed recently9 to possess a
novel mechanism of inhibition of all ca isozymes (fig. 1d). indeed,
as discussed above, this compound does not interact with the catalytic
zn(ii) ion or the water coordinated to it (similarly to phenol), but binds
at the entrance of the active site cavity, occluding it and forming several favorable interactions with asn62, his64, gln92 and a water molecule.9 another interesting aspect of this compound is that it acts as a
prodrug, since it is formed by active site hydrolysis of coumarin.9 furthermore, this inhibition is time-dependent, with the ﬁnal inhibitor,
that is, 2- xxxd1756xxx , being formed after 4–6 h after incubation of enzyme and coumarin. thus, we have investigated whether
the phenolic acids from this study might possess a time-dependent ca
inhibitory activity. thus, we incubated hca ii with compounds 4–11
for variable periods of time (15 min–24 h) and measured the inhibition constants. in all cases, no time-dependent inhibition has been observed, that is, the kis were the same after all incubation periods
(within the limits of experimental errors, data not shown). thus, we
can rule out an inhibition mechanism of type (iii) discussed in the
introduction. more probably, the phenols investigated here, of type
4–11, inhibit cas by a mechanism of type (ii), of the phenol type,
anchoring to the water molecule from the enzyme active site. further
studies are warranted in this ﬁeld, as only one x-ray crystal structure
of cas with a phenols is available at this moment, the one of ca ii with
1. more such crystallographic data would be critical for better understanding the ca inhibition mechanism with various types of phenols.
3. conclusions
a detailed inhibition study of 12 mammalian isoform of the
metalloenzyme ca, that is, ca i–xiv, with a series of (poly)phenols
was performed. several phenolic acids and phenol natural products, such as p-hydroxybenzoic acid, p- xxxd1756xxx ,  xxxd403xxx ,
ferulic acid, gallic acid, syringic acid, quercetin, and  xxxd1979xxx ,
were investigated for their inhibitory with these enzymes. all
mammalian isozymes hca i–hca xii, mca xiii and hca xiv were
inhibited in the low micromolar or submicromolar range by these
(poly)phenols (kis in the range of 0.87–7.79 lm). p-hydroxybenzoic acid was the best inhibitor of all isozymes (kis of 0.87–35.4 lm)
and the different isozymes showed very variable inhibition proﬁles
with these derivatives. phenols like the ones investigated here possess a ca inhibition mechanism distinct of that of the sulfonamides/sulfamates used clinically or the coumarins. unlike the
sulfonamides, which bind to the catalytic zinc ion, phenols are anchored at the zn(ii)-coordinated water molecule and bind more
externally within the active site cavity, making contacts with various amino acid residues. as this is the region with the highest variability between the many ca isozymes found in mammals, this
class of compounds may lead to isoform-selective inhibitors targeting just one or few of the medicinally relevant cas.
4. experimental
4.1. chemistry
buffers, phenols 4–11 and acetazolamide 3 were from sigma–aldrich (milan, italy) of highest purity available, and were used without further puriﬁcation. all ca isozymes were recombinant ones
produced and puriﬁed in our laboratory as described earlier.1–4
4.2. ca catalytic/inhibition assay
an sx.18mv-r applied photophysics (oxford, uk) stopped-ﬂow
instrument has been used to assay the catalytic/inhibition of various

2163

ca isozymes as reported by khalifah.27 phenol red (at a concentration of 0.2 mm) has been used as indicator, working at the absorbance maximum of 557 nm, with 10 mm hepes (ph 7.4) as buffer,
0.1 m na2so4 or naclo4 (for maintaining constant the ionic
strength; these anions are not inhibitory in the used concentration),1–4 following the ca-catalyzed co2 hydration reaction for a period of 5–10 s. saturated co2 solutions in water at 25 °c were used as
substrate. stock solutions of inhibitors were prepared at a concentration of 10 mm (in dmso/water 1:1, v/v) and dilutions up to
0.001 lm done with the assay buffer mentioned above. inhibitor
and enzyme solutions were preincubated together for 15 min at
room temperature prior to assay, in order to allow for the formation
of the e-i complex. the inhibition constants were obtained by nonlinear least-squares methods using prism 3, as reported earlier,1–4,9
and represent the mean from at least three different determinations.
