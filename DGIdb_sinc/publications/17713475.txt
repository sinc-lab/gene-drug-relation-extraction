expression of  xxxd557xxx 
dehydrogenase type i and type ii after
 xxxd2677xxx  treatment: a 2-year
follow-up in kidney transplantation

the objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of  xxxd2677xxx  (mmf) on the regulation of inosine
monophosphate dehydrogenase (impdh) during the first 2 years after renal transplantation. twelve patients were
enrolled, and 10-h time-course evaluations of the effects of mmf were regularly performed during the study. impdh
activity and gene expression were measured in whole blood and in mononuclear cells, respectively. type i impdh
( xxxg1186xxx ) mrna was increased during the first 3 months following transplantation and reached its maximal level during
acute rejection episodes, whereas type ii impdh mrna was stable. furthermore, although no alteration in the predose
samples was observed, patients with prolonged mmf treatment exhibited an increase in the induction potency of both
impdh activity and gene expression. in vitro experiments confirmed that  xxxg1186xxx  is inducible, but preferentially in
monocytes than in lymphocytes. this finding suggests that the measurement of impdh mrnas may provide reliable
information to predict acute rejection.

 xxxd2677xxx  (mmf) exerts its immunosuppressive activity through its active metabolite,  xxxd2678xxx 
(mpa), by inhibiting the de novo biosynthesis of guanine
nucleotides.  xxxd557xxx  dehydrogenase
(impdh), the essential and probably rate-limiting step in
this de novo pathway, catalyzes the nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide-dependent oxidation of  xxxd557xxx  (imp) to xanthosine monophosphate, an intermediate
metabolite in the synthesis of  xxxd2247xxx .1,2
there are two isoforms of impdh that are encoded by
two distinct genes: type i and type ii.3 these two isoenzymes
are 84% identical, contain 514 amino acids, and share similar
substrate affinities, catalytic activities, and ki values.3–6 type i
impdh ( xxxg1186xxx ) is considered to be the constitutive
isoform and is expressed in the majority of cells, including
resting lymphocytes.7,8 mitogen activation of peripheral
blood lymphocytes is associated with increased impdh
activity and upregulation of the two impdh genes.9,10
malignant transformation of cells leads to increased impdh

activity because of increased expression of the type ii impdh
( xxxg1187xxx ) mrna.7,11–13 furthermore, the regulation of
expression of the two impdh genes differs according to the
isoform:  xxxg1186xxx  mrna is expressed in a complex manner
with three transcripts arising from three alternate promoters,
providing possible mechanisms for tissue- or developmentally
specific expression of this isoenzyme;14  xxxg1187xxx  is strongly
upregulated at the transcriptional level by a promoter region
that responds directly to growth stimuli, supporting a more
specific role for  xxxg1187xxx  in cell proliferation.15,16 results of
homozygous deletion of the two impdh genes also differ
according to the isoform, with a very early embryonic
lethality in mice for the type ii,17 and a mild phenotype for
 xxxg1186xxx .18 interestingly, heterozygous deletions of the two
impdh genes have shown that overlapping contributions
from the two impdh isoforms are required to obtain
increased levels of guanine nucleotides necessary for normal
lymphocyte activation in response to mitogens and for
cytokine production and normal cytolytic t-cell function.18

impdh activity in transplant patients

we have previously shown that long-term treatment of
kidney transplant patients with mmf is associated with an
induction of impdh activity.19 similar but also contradictory results have been reported depending on the
methodology or the biological matrix (erythrocytes versus
lymphocytes) used for measuring impdh activity.20–25 to
investigate further the effect of mmf on the regulation of
impdh, we followed, during 2 years, de novo kidney
transplant recipients under triple immunosuppression
regimen consisting of cyclosporine, mmf, and steroids.
time-course evaluations of the expression of the two
impdh genes were performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) derived from these patients at different
time points spanning the 24-month period following
transplantation.

as shown in figure 1a, the impdh activity profile for the
first 3 months of treatment with mmf was similar to that
reported in previous studies.19 as we reported earlier, an
induction of impdh activity occurred in patients treated
with mmf during a long period of time. a rapid and almost
total inhibition of impdh activity was followed by a phase of
increase of the enzyme activity that could reach 2–4 times the
baseline levels (figure 1b, p ¼ 0.03). we verified in five renal
transplant patients treated for more than 18 months with
mmf that the impdh activity measured in isolated mononuclear cells represents approximately 50% of the enzyme
activity quantified in whole blood (data not shown).
gene expression of impdh in transplant patients

the gene expression profiles of  xxxg1186xxx  and  xxxg1187xxx 
determined in mononuclear cells, isolated from a given
patient during the 24 months of the trial, are represented in
figure 2. for this patient, gene expression of  xxxg1186xxx  was
high during the first month of treatment compared with the
profiles measured at 6, 12, and 24 months of treatment with
mmf (figure 2a–d). gene expression of  xxxg1187xxx  was
stable during the 10-h time course achieved at 1, 6, and 12
months of treatment with mmf (figure 2e–g), whereas a
threefold stimulation of  xxxg1187xxx  rna occurred 2 h after
the intake of mmf when the patient reached month 24 of
treatment with the drug (figure 2h).
for all the patients enrolled in this study, the predose and
maximal levels of impdh gene expression as well as the auc
representing gene expression versus time from 0 to 10 h were
determined as explained in the methods, and are represented
in tables 2 and 3. furthermore, the degrees of repression and
induction of impdh gene expression were quantified and
reported in these tables.
a high variability of  xxxg1186xxx  gene expression was
observed during the 24-month follow-up. however, these
data showed that  xxxg1186xxx  gene expression was highest
during the first 3 months following transplantation as
compared to the last 6–24 months of the study in terms of
predose levels (6.5+6.6 versus 2.8+1.6, respectively,
p ¼ 0.04), maximal levels (17.1+15.6 versus 7.0+6.0,
respectively, p ¼ 0.006), and auc(0–10) (96.8+86.3 versus

such an increase in  xxxg1186xxx  gene expression during
episodes of acute rejection was quite unexpected, as the
impdh isoform that has been extensively related to
lymphocyte activation is  xxxg1187xxx .15,16 we performed ex
vivo standard stimulation of pbmcs to verify that, in our
hands,  xxxg1187xxx  is indeed the inducible isoform. pbmcs
were stimulated with phytohemagglutin-l (pha-l) for 24 h,
and the non-adherent cells (i.e., the lymphocytes) were
analyzed. as represented in figure 3,  xxxg1187xxx  gene
expression was increased in stimulated lymphocytes
(p ¼ 0.0002), whereas  xxxg1186xxx  gene expression was reduced
(p ¼ 0.05).
we next separated monocytes and lymphocytes from
freshly harvested pbmcs and examined the expression of the
clinical pharmacology & therapeutics | volume 83 number 2 | february 2008

two impdh genes. the  xxxg1187xxx  mrna was equally
expressed in monocytes and lymphocytes, whereas a fourfold
higher expression of  xxxg1186xxx  mrna was found in
monocytes (figure 4, p50.05).
because  xxxg1186xxx  seemed to be preferentially expressed in
monocytes as compared to lymphocytes, we then performed
mixed leukocyte reaction (mlr) experiments and examined
the expression of the two impdh genes in both monocytes
and lymphocytes. different patterns of expression of both
impdh genes in lymphocytes and monocytes were recovered
(figure 5, p50.0001). an eightfold induction of the
expression of  xxxg1186xxx  was exhibited in the monocyte
compartment as early as 1 h after the contact of the
heterologous cells (figure 5a) and was gradually reduced to
reach baseline levels at 24 h (p50.01). interestingly, although
the induction of  xxxg1186xxx  in monocytes was progressively
decreasing, a gradual and concomitant elevation of the
expression of  xxxg1187xxx  occurred in lymphocytes to reach an
eightfold induction at 24 h (figure 5b, p50.001).

discussion

our study confirms the induction of impdh activity that we
have previously reported in renal transplant patients taking
mmf for a prolonged period of time.19 we found that this
induction of impdh activity is associated with similarly
increased levels of impdh mrna in blood mononuclear
cells. moreover, we established for the first time that the
expression of the  xxxg1186xxx  mrna is upregulated during
the first 3 months following transplantation and that this
induction is dramatically strengthened during acute rejection
episodes. in addition, we examined the distribution of the
two impdh genes in blood mononuclear cells and found
that  xxxg1186xxx  is preferentially expressed in monocytes.
we and others have described significant changes in the
pharmacodynamic behavior of mmf over time on impdh
activity and also on guanosine nucleotide formation.19–24
taken together, these observations have led to the assumption
332

that the induction of impdh activity in patients’ whole
blood19 was related to its increase in erythrocytes. our
present longitudinal pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
monitoring of renal transplant patients confirms that, during
the 12-h interval of administration of mmf, impdh activity
measured in patients’ whole blood is first inhibited in
response to mpa plasma peak. it then either returns to
baseline levels for patients treated for less than 3 months with
mmf or is two- to fourfold higher than baseline levels when
these patients reached 2 years of treatment with mmf. the
latter induction of impdh activity is not only of erythrocyte
origin, as we show that, in the mononuclear cells derived
from these patients, similar induction of  xxxg1186xxx  and -ii
mrna also occurs following the plasma peak of mpa.
devyatko et al.25 have recently reported a study with stable
heart transplant patients after switch from azathioprine to
mmf. they found that intracellular levels of guanosine
volume 83 number 2 | february 2008 | www.nature.com/cpt

articles

triphosphate and  xxxd83xxx  in peripheral
mononuclear cells did not change after conversion during
the 1-year period, whereas predose impdh activity significantly declined after switch to mmf.25 however, both a
partial restoration of the enzyme activity and an induction of
the salvage pathway enzymes, guanine phosphoryltransferase
(gprt) and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase
( xxxg1075xxx ), were observed when the patients reached 1 year of
treatment with mmf.25 the authors postulated that the latter
induction may explain the maintenance of guanosine
triphosphate levels in pbmcs. this finding well illustrates
the required contributions from impdh and  xxxg1075xxx  to
achieve normal lymphocyte activation, as it has been
supported by genetic experiments.17,18 consistent with the
report from devyatko et al.,25 our finding suggests that
mononuclear cells derived from stable transplant patients
tend to resist treatment administered to inhibit their
proliferation by reducing the formation of guanosine
nucleotides. their means of reversing such a treatment is to
induce the synthesis of the mpa target impdh and to induce
the salvage pathway gprt and  xxxg1075xxx .
in addition to the measurement of impdh activity, this
study shows that the monitoring of impdh gene expression
may also be informative about the degree of immunosuppression following transplantation. we demonstrate that
 xxxg1186xxx  mrna is two- to threefold increased during the
first 3 months following transplantation, and it is well
established that during this period of time, transplant
recipients are not considered as stable patients. a 20-fold
increase of  xxxg1186xxx  mrna was hence observed in the two
patients who experienced acute rejection. these observations
strongly suggest that increased  xxxg1186xxx  gene expression
may constitute a useful biomarker for resistance to
immunosuppressive drugs. however, this conclusion will
have to be confirmed by additional studies in consideration
with other factors such as hla mismatches or mpa and
other drug levels. indeed, one limitation of this study is the
limited number of enrolled patients, which is due to
difficulties implementing such a protocol for a large number
of individuals. consequently, among the studied patients,
only two experienced acute rejection. in the case of these two
patients, other risk factors related to graft rejection, such as
viral infection, could have interfered with the biological data.
however, we have verified that these patients were free of
viral infection at the time of the rejection. another limitation
is the variability of  xxxg1186xxx  gene expression. finally, we
made an unexpected observation concerning the impdh
isoforms, as acute rejection was found to correlate  xxxg1186xxx 
induction rather than  xxxg1187xxx . to support our in vivo
studies, we have carried in vitro experiments to revisit
the expression and regulation of impdh isoforms in white
blood cells.
in the field of transplantation, the initiation of primary
immune responses is known to result from the interaction of
dendritic cells and t lymphocytes. bone marrow-derived
monocytes migrate into tissues, especially at sites of

inflammation and allograft rejection. there, they differentiate
into macrophages that produce proinflammatory cytokines,
such as interleukin-1b and  xxxg2296xxx -a, and play
major roles in the pathogenesis of inflammation and graft
rejection.29 interestingly, we found that  xxxg1186xxx  is preferentially expressed in monocytes rather than in lymphocytes. furthermore, we showed that the monocyte  xxxg1186xxx 
gene was the first isoform to be upregulated as early as 1 h
after the initiation of an mlr experiment. this induction
of the  xxxg1186xxx  gene in monocytes was transient, lasted less
than 12 h, and was then replaced by a gradual increase in
 xxxg1187xxx  gene expression in lymphocytes. the latter
induction of  xxxg1187xxx  was consistent with previously
published reports. these findings suggest that the increase
of  xxxg1186xxx , which we have found in our monitoring of
impdh gene expression in renal transplant patients, might
be due to its regulation in monocytes. mmf was shown to
decrease  xxxd2247xxx  levels as a result of a decline
of impdh activity in differentiating monocytes, immature
and mature dendritic cells in vitro30 and also to reduce their
capacity to stimulate the proliferation of t cells. the 20-fold
increase in  xxxg1186xxx  mrna exhibited by the two renal
transplant patients who experienced acute rejection was
indeed reduced by 50% following mmf intake. this efficacy
of mmf may explain that no increase in  xxxg1187xxx  mrna
was observed in the two renal transplant patients with
biopsy-proven acute rejection. although mpa is a tightbinding, reversible, and uncompetitive inhibitor of the
enzyme impdh,31 it may also alter impdh at the gene
level. indeed, treatment of malignant transformed cells (i.e.,
exhibiting a strong impdh activity and high levels of
 xxxg1187xxx  mrna) with drugs, such as retinoids or mmf to
induce their terminal differentiation, led to a decrease in both
impdh activity and  xxxg1187xxx  mrna levels.32 alternatively,
the inhibition of impdh activity per se could influence
 xxxg1186xxx  and -ii gene expression.
in conclusion, we show here that the induction of impdh
activity after prolonged exposure to mmf may be partially
explained by the upregulation of  xxxg1186xxx  and -ii mrnas in
pbmcs. furthermore, the induction of  xxxg1186xxx  gene,
possibly in monocytes, in unstable transplant patients and in
patients experiencing acute rejection, suggests that the
measurement of impdh mrnas may provide reliable
information about the degree of resistance to immunosuppression following transplantation. we are now evaluating the
monitoring of impdh gene expression to predict acute
rejection in other types of solid organ transplantation.

patients. twelve patients were enrolled prospectively in this study
approved by our local ethics of committee, after informed consent
had been obtained. patient and transplantation characteristics are
listed in table 4. these patients underwent kidney transplantation
and received their immunosuppressive treatment consisting of an
association of cyclosporine, mmf, and prednisone. cyclosporine
was given initially at a dose of 6–8 mg/kg/day, which was then
adjusted according to whole blood concentrations, to achieve a

therapeutic range of 150–200 ng/ml for the first 6 months following
transplantation and then lowered to 100–150 ng/ml. mmf was
administered at a dose of 1 g twice a day. prednisone was
administered intravenously at a dose of 500 mg immediately after
the transplantation and was then given orally at an initial dose of
1 mg/kg/day, which was progressively tapered to achieve 10 mg/day
after 3 months of treatment. five patients did not complete the
study because of biopsy-proven acute rejection occurrence in two
patients, substantial increase of creatinemia leading to the switch of
cyclosporine to tacrolimus in one patient, and finally because the
protocol requirements were considered to be too tedious in the case
of two other patients (the time-course evaluations were performed
during 12 h at the beginning of the study, but they were then
reduced to 10 h to be less tedious for the patients). blood samples
were collected just before the transplantation for baseline determination of impdh activity and impdh gene expression.
a 10-h time-course evaluation of the effects of mmf was
performed 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months following transplantation.
the patients were asked to take their medications as they would do
normally. the general regimen in this trial included the collection of
the predose samples after an overnight fast and the administration
of the medication.
whole blood samples were collected before dosing and 1/2, 1, 2,
4, 6, 8, and 10 h after administration of mmf. all samples were
collected in tubes that contained edta as an anticoagulant. whole
blood aliquots were immediately processed for determination of
impdh activity, whereas the remaining samples were stored at 48c
until the last sample was collected. the samples were then processed
for plasma separation with storage of the plasma aliquots at 208c
for later measurement of mpa and isolation of mononuclear cells by
 xxxd3253xxx  gradient density method (lymphoprep, invitrogen, cergypontoise, france). mononuclear cells were washed, resuspended in
tripure reagent (roche diagnostic, meylan, france), and stored at
808c for later extraction of rna.
mpa measurement. monoclonal mpa levels were determined in
plasma by using an immunoenzymatic assay (dade-behring, paris
la défense, france) adapted on a cobas mira analyzer (hoffmannlaroche, basel, switzerland). this assay was shown to give
comparable results with the high-performance liquid chromatography method of ref.33 pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using the kinetica software (simed, creteil, france), as
described previously.19

determination of impdh activity. the activity of impdh was
determined in whole blood by the estimation of the 3h-release from
[2,8-3h]hypoxanthine (38 ci/mmol; moravek pharmaceuticals,
brea, ca, usa), as described previously.19 because the enzyme
activity in some patients (in particular long-term treated patients)
was found to be diminished when whole blood samples were stored
at 48c, all measurements were performed no later than after 3–4 h of
storage at room temperature. furthermore, the stability of
expression of impdh activity during an 8-h time course was
verified in an untreated healthy patient.
gene expression of impdh. for assessment of gene expression,
real-time, semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction was performed using taqman technology. total rna was
extracted from mononuclear cells using the tripure reagent (roche
diagnostics, meylan, france), as recommended by the manufacturer,
and further purified from remaining potential dna using the
rnase-free dnase set and the rneasy minelute cleanup kit
(qiagen, courtaboeuf, france). rna was then quantified and 500 ng
of rna was reverse transcribed at 378c for 2 h using the highcapacity cdna archive kit (applied biosystems, applera, courtaboeuf, france). amplification of  xxxg1186xxx  and  xxxg1187xxx  cdnas
was performed on an abi prism 7900ht sequence detector system
(applied biosystems) using the corresponding taqman gene
expression assays. relative mrna levels were estimated using
the 2ddct method with  xxxg1977xxx  as reference gene. the polymerase chain reaction primer  xxxg1977xxx  was designed using
oligo explorer software and its quantitative reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction was performed with absolute quantitative
polymerase chain reaction sybr green (abgene, villebon sur yvette,
france).
the predose (level0) and maximal (levelmax) levels of impdh
gene expression were determined for each 10-h time-course
evaluation of the effects of mmf. auc representing gene expression
versus time from 0 to 10 h (auc(0–10)) was estimated using the
trapezoidal rule method. results were also expressed as percentage
of gene expression; 100% gene expression was arbitrarily given for
the predose sample, and results of percentage of gene expression
were plotted against time. the effects of mmf on impdh gene
expression during the 10-h time-course monitoring were assessed, as
described previously, for the effects of mmf on impdh activity19
by measuring the aucs below and above the 100% gene expression,
thereby quantifying the degrees of repression and induction,
respectively.
isolation and ex vivo stimulation of pbmcs. human venous blood
was drawn from healthy volunteers using heparin as an anticoagulant. pbmcs were isolated from blood by  xxxd3253xxx  gradient
density method using standard conditions. mononuclear cells were
harvested, washed, and resuspended in rpmi-1640 medium
(invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 iu/ml
penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine.
mononuclear cells were counted, diluted in complete rpmi to
1  106 cells/ml, and 1 ml of this suspension was seeded into 12- or
24-well cluster plates. cells were stimulated for 24 h with
phytohemagglutinin at a dose recommended by the manufacturer
(pha-l, 2.5 mg/ml, sigma, saint-quentin-fallavier, france).
in some experiments, mlrs were performed by seeding 1  106
freshly isolated mononuclear cells (see above) into 24-well cluster
plates. cells were maintained for 24 h in complete rpmi medium to
let monocytes adhere to the plates. supernatants with the nonadherent cells (i.e., lymphocytes) were then harvested and replaced
by heterologous non-adherent cells in complete rpmi medium that
were seeded the day before under similar conditions (1  106 freshly
isolated mononuclear cells into 24-well cluster plates). the cells were
then harvested separately, i.e., adherent cells (monocytes) and cells
in suspension (lymphocytes), at the indicated times from 1 to 24 h.
