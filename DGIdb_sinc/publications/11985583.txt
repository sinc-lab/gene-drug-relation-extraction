of the properties of recombinant human  xxxg1296xxx

recombinant human  xxxg1296xxx  ( xxxg1296xxx ,  xxxg1296xxx ) was puriﬁed to homogeneity (60-fold) from
spodoptera frugiperda (sf9) cells infected with baculovirus
containing the  xxxg1296xxx  gene. the puriﬁcation protocol
comprised ammonium sulfate precipitation and several
chromatographic steps, including deae–sepharose
cl-6b, hydroxyapatite, strong anionic and cationic separations. the purity of the enzyme was determined by sds/
page, and the molecular mass veriﬁed by maldi-tof
ms. the monomeric molecular mass of 52.4 kda determined was > 99.99% of the predicted molecular mass. a
uv absorption spectrum of the holoenzyme resulted in a
peak at 432 nm. the optimum ph was 8.25 and the enzyme

displayed a strong dependence on the ionic strength of the
buﬀer for optimum activity. this cloned enzyme was highly
speciﬁc for 3-hydroxykynurenine (km ¼ 3.0 lm ± 0.10)
and was inhibited by l-kynurenine (ki ¼ 20 lm),
d-kynurenine (ki ¼ 12 lm) and a synthetic substrate
analogue d,l-3,7-dihydroxydesaminokynurenine (ki ¼
100 nm). the activity/concentration proﬁle for  xxxg1296xxx 
from this source was sigmoidal in all instances. there
appeared to be partial inhibition by substrate, and excess
pyridoxal 5¢-phosphate was found to be inhibitory.

rapid progress in the pathophysiology of human diseases
has always been hampered by the availability of human
tissue, aesthetics, and ethical considerations. the principle
aim of this study was to express a clone of human
 xxxg1296xxx  in an appropriate host that would yield
sufﬁcient quantities of protein to permit identiﬁcation and
biochemical characterization of the enzyme and investigation into the effects of various synthetic and endogenous
inhibitors. achieving these objectives could provide an
avenue for pharmacological modulation of the synthesis of
the n-methyl d-aspartate receptor agonist and the excitotoxin, quinolinic acid, in addition to elevating the levels of
the neuroprotective kynurenate [1]. quinolinic acid has been
implicated as an aetiological factor in a range of neurodegenerative diseases which include epilepsy, huntington’s
disease, aids-related dementia, and septicaemia, where it is
released as part of the inﬂammatory response to injury [2,3].
 xxxg1296xxx  is one of the enzymes involved in the
tryptophan metabolic pathway. it is a pyridoxal 5¢-phosphate (plp)-dependent enzyme which catalyses the b,chydrolytic cleavage of the amino acids l-kynurenine (1) and
l-3-hydroxykynurenine (2) to give l-alanine (3) and either
 xxxd189xxx  (4) or 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (5)
(scheme 1) [4]. this pathway is crucial in the biosynthesis
of nicotinamide nucleotides [5] and also gives rise to other

pathophysiologically important compounds such as picolinic
acid, an enhancer of  xxxd2738xxx  synthase expression [6].
 xxxg1296xxx  has been puriﬁed and characterized from a
number of different sources, such as bacteria, vertebrates
and fungi, but very little is known about the human form.
the microbial enzyme from some sources has been shown
to be present as two isozymes with differing speciﬁcities
toward l-kynurenine and 3-hydroxykynurenine [7]. recombinant human enzyme is reported to be a homodimer with a
monomeric molecular mass of  52.4 kda and shares an
amino-acid sequence homology of about 85% with cytosolic rat hepatic  xxxg1296xxx , which has also been cloned
and expressed [8]. there have been a few attempts to isolate
and purify cloned human  xxxg1296xxx  but with limited
success, although the bacterial enzyme has been cloned [9].
previous researchers [10] have demonstrated activity in
human embryonic kidney ﬁbroblast (hek-293)-transfected
cell homogenates with a km of 13.2 lm for 3-hydroxykynurenine and 671 lm for l-kynurenine for the catalytically
active human enzyme.

[10] and cloned into the bac-to-bac baculovirus expression system (gibco-brl) which was used to express
 xxxg1296xxx  in spodoptera frugiperda (sf9) insect cells
[11]. sf9 cells were grown at 28 c in tc-100 suspension
cultures of 10 l containing a minimal amount of fetal calf
serum (1–2%) until 10 ml of growing cells resulted in a
conﬂuent layer when placed in a small petri dish. infection
of the sf9 cells and expression of  xxxg1296xxx  proceeded in
tc-100 in the absence of any fetal calf serum. the infection
was allowed to proceed for 96 ± 12 h depending on the
degree of lysis. light microscopy was used to monitor the
infection process, and, when isolated nuclei appeared amid a
host of grossly deformed cells, the cells were harvested and
active enzyme extracted. a puriﬁcation protocol was then
developed (table 1) to obtain homogeneous enzyme.
purification protocol
all steps were performed at 4 c and long-term storage
occurred at )80 c. the tubes for collecting the various
fractions always contained 20 ll of a 10-mm stock plp
solution in order to increase the stability of  xxxg1296xxx .
the infected sf9 cell culture (10 l) was harvested after 96 h
by centrifugation at 5000 g for 7 min. both the supernatant
and the pellet (whole cells) were retained. harvested insect
cells were resuspended in cold buffer a consisting of
100 mm tris/hcl buffer (ph 7.5) containing 0.25 m
sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm egta, 10 lm plp,
100 lm phenylmethanesulfonyl ﬂuoride, 2 lgæml)1 aprotinin plus 1 lgæml)1 pepstatin and leupeptin, and sonicated
on ice. (all subsequent buffers contained the protease
inhibitors, plp, dithiothreitol and egta at the above
concentrations.) the resultant fraction was then centrifuged
at 12 000 g for 20 min. this procedure was repeated up to
four times with retention of the supernatant. both supernatants were shown to contain all the activity. the supernatant was brought to 20% (nh4)2so4 saturation centrifuged
 xxxd1891xxx  000 g for 15 min and the pellet discarded. then the
(nh4)2so4 was increased to 80% to precipitate  xxxg1296xxx  and centrifugation carried out as above. this pellet
was redissolved in 3 ml buffer a, equilibrated with 50 ml

20 mm tris/hcl at ph 8.6 and applied to a deae blue
sepharose cl-6b afﬁnity column (1.5 · 30 cm) that had
been equilibrated with 10 mm tris/hcl buffer at ph 8.6, at
a ﬂow rate of 1.5 mlæmin)1. the enzyme was eluted in the
unbound fraction devoid of any plp. concentration and
equilibration of fractions containing active  xxxg1296xxx 
during this step and elsewhere were performed in an
amicon ultraﬁltration unit incorporating a nitrocellulose
membrane of exclusion limit 50 kda. this system always
retained the recombinant enzyme. fractions containing
active enzyme were pooled, equilibrated in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.2), concentrated to 3.0 ml,
and applied to a hydroxyapatite (ultrogel) column
(3.0 · 25 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer at ph 7.2. the column with bound  xxxg1296xxx  was washed with 3 vol. equilibration buffer and then
eluted with a stepwise gradient of sodium phosphate (10–
500 mm) buffer at a ﬂow rate of 1 mlæmin)1.  xxxg1296xxx 
was eluted at  160 mm.
active fractions were again pooled, equilibrated in
20 mm tricine/naoh, ph 8.8, concentrated to 4.0 ml
and applied to a strong anion-exchange (macro-prep strong
s support) column (1.5 · 30 cm) previously equilibrated
with 20 mm tricine/naoh at ph 8.8 buffer at a ﬂow rate
of 2 mlæmin)1. bound enzyme was washed with 3 column
vol. equilibration buffer followed by stepwise elution with
nacl (10–500 mm) in column equilibration buffer at a ﬂow
rate of 3.0 mlæmin)1. the enzyme was eluted at 60 mm
nacl. a macro-prep strong q support column
(1.5 · 30 cm) was equilibrated with 20 mm  xxxd2282xxx /hcl
buffer at ph 6.0, and the pooled active fractions from the
anion-exchange step were equilibrated (20 mm  xxxd2282xxx /hcl,
ph 6.0) and concentrated (4.0 ml) as previously. the
concentrated fraction was applied to the column at a ﬂow
rate of 2.0 mlæmin)1, and bound  xxxg1296xxx  was washed
with 3 column vol. equilibration buffer and eluted stepwise
with kcl (0–400 mm) in 20 mm  xxxd2282xxx /hcl buffer, ph 6.0,
at a ﬂow rate of 3.0 mlæmin)1.  xxxg1296xxx  was eluted at
 60 mm kcl. samples containing  xxxg1296xxx  were
pooled, concentrated (4.0 ml), and equilibrated in buffer
(20 mm imidazole/hcl, ph 6.8) as described previously and
applied to the strong anion-exchange column (1.5 · 30 cm)
used earlier at a ﬂow rate of 2.0 mlæmin)1. this column had
been equilibrated with 20 mm imidazole/hcl buffer,
ph 6.8. the enzyme was eluted in the unbound fraction
and was pooled, concentrated, and equilibrated in assay
buffer (10 mm tris/hcl, ph 7.9), divided into aliquots, and
stored at )80 c until further use. the various puriﬁcation
steps were followed by sds/page (12% gels) [12]; where a

recombinant human  xxxg1296xxx  (eur. j. biochem. 269) 2071

tryptic mass ﬁngerprint obtained by matrix-assisted laser
desorption ionization time-of-ﬂight (maldi-tof) ms of
a band of the expected molecular mass conﬁrmed its identity
as  xxxg1296xxx . the protein concentrations were determined with the bradford assay [13]. recombinant human
 xxxg1296xxx  from the ﬁnal anion-exchange step was
assayed for purity using both sds/page and malditof ms of the whole protein. both puriﬁed and crude
samples of recombinant  xxxg1296xxx  can be stored in the
absence or presence of plp for extended periods of time
(> 12 months) at )80 c without any loss of activity. at
4 c the enzyme is stable for up to 2 weeks in the presence
of plp, and this is how crude enzyme solution was stored
between successive steps.
activity assays
 xxxg1296xxx  activity of the enzyme was monitored spectroﬂuorimetrically at 37 c, with excitation of the product
3-hydroxyanthranilate at 330 nm and emission at 410 nm
and 310 nm and 417 nm respectively for anthranilate, by
the method of shetty & gaertner [7]. a perkin–elmer
luminescence spectrometer (model ls50b) connected to a
grant circulating water bath was used for this purpose. the
ﬁnal reaction volume was 3.0 ml consisting of 25 nmol
plp (saturating), 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer at
ph 7.9, substrate 3-hydroxykynurenine, and an appropriate
volume of enzyme. enzyme was always added last for all
reactions including the inhibition studies. the amount of
product formed was determined with reference to a
standard curve of ﬂuorescence intensity against 3-hydroxyanthranilate concentration. the kinetic assays were performed using both crude and pure (> 95%) forms of the
enzyme. reproducibility of the experimental ﬁndings was
conﬁrmed with enzyme from different batches and varying
degrees of purity in addition to replicates from within the
same batch, and kinetic analyses showed no signiﬁcant
difference between the various extracts. a progress curve
was constructed to conﬁrm the linear relationship between
product formation, protein concentration, and time. linearity of the enzymatic reaction was determined over 5 min.
to achieve temperature equilibration (37 c), the assay
mixture was incubated for at least 5 min before initiation of
the reaction. graphs were plotted using the cricketgraph
and graphpad prism3 software packages, and the kinetic
parameters km and vmax were obtained using non-linear
regression. lineweaver–burk and dixon [14] plots were
used to characterize the type of inhibition. hill analysis was
also carried out to conﬁrm the co-operativity.

has been removed during the puriﬁcation procedure. discgel electrophoresis in the absence of reducing agents sds
and  xxxd26xxx  to determine the native dimeric
molecular mass resulted in the appearance of two bands
at  52.5 and 95 kda (gel image not shown), and this shows
that the native protein exists mainly in the dimeric form.
there was, however, a fair amount of tailing between the
two bands which was probably due to the continuous
association and disassociation of the respective subunits.
owing to the asynchronized viral infection cycle, lysis of a
proportion of the transformed insect cells occurred, as was
observed microscopically. this resulted in the presence of
exogenous active  xxxg1296xxx  in the tissue culture medium.
hence an 80% (nh4)2so4 precipitation was performed on
the supernatant obtained from harvesting the whole cells.
this fraction was puriﬁed separately, and the overall yield
was signiﬁcantly lower than the whole cell fraction but
sufﬁcient to warrant puriﬁcation. the total pooled (supernatant + whole cells) enzyme activity from 10 l culture
medium was  14 lmolæmin)1 with a speciﬁc activity of
164 nmolæmin)1æmg)1 (see table 1 for fractional puriﬁcation of the supernatant). the puriﬁed enzyme was shown to
be puriﬁed to homogeneity (fig. 1) by sds/page on a
12% gel with subsequent coomassie brilliant blue staining.
the molecular mass as determined by maldi-tof ms
was 52.4 kda, which is > 99.99% that of the predicted
amino-acid sequence encoded by the cloned 1600 bp. a
tryptic mass ﬁngerprint obtained by maldi-tof ms also
conﬁrmed the identity of the protein as  xxxg1296xxx . the
uv absorption spectrum of the puriﬁed dimeric native
protein at a concentration of 1.80 mgæml)1 in 10 mm tris/
hcl buffer at ph 7.9 and 4 c showed a peak at 432 nm,
which was due to the presence of the plp cofactor (data not
shown). this scan was identical with that obtained by
2 kishore [15] for  xxxg1296xxx  from pseudomonas marginalis.
kinetic characterization of the recombinant human
 xxxg1296xxx  revealed that the enzyme was speciﬁc for
3-hydroxykynurenine with an experimentally observed km
of 3.0 ± 0.10 lm for the racemic substrate (d,l-3-hydroxykynurenine) [8,10]. graphical analysis shows that the

results
using the puriﬁcation protocol described above, human
recombinant  xxxg1296xxx  was puriﬁed > 60-fold from the
supernatant fraction to yield active enzyme with a ﬁnal
speciﬁc activity of 164 nmolæmin)1æ(mg protein))1. the full
results of the puriﬁcation are given in table 1.
it is not known why there is an initial increase in the
activity during the puriﬁcation (table 1) given that the
puriﬁcation was performed at saturating plp concentrations, however, there was no change in the electrophoretic
mobility of the sds/ xxxd26xxx -treated enzyme from
these crude extracts. it is possible that an inhibitor molecule

enzyme is subjected to substrate regulation (graph not

sigmoidal fashion (fig. 2). in contrast to previous reports,
no substrate activity could be detected with l-kynurenine,
using either a ﬂuorimetric or uv spectroscopic assay.
however, l-kynurenine was found to be a competitive
inhibitor at low substrate concentrations (ki ¼ 20 lm)
and non-competitive at higher levels of substrate
(ki¢ ¼ 55 lm) (fig. 3). d-kynurenine was also found to
inhibit the enzyme (data not shown, ki ¼ 12 lm) as did a

two compounds were also found to be mixed inhibitors of
the enzyme (data not shown).
the ph optimum was determined as 8.25 and the activity
of the enzyme was found to be strongly dependent on the
ionic strength of the buffer. all assays, however, were
performed at ph 7.9 because initial experiments with crude
fractions were performed before the establishment of the
ph-dependence curve. there was no signiﬁcant difference in
terms of reaction velocity between these two ph values. at
ph 7.9, in 10 mm tris/hcl buffer at 37 c, velocity against
substrate plots in the absence and presence (fig. 2) of the
inhibitor d,l-3,7-dihydroxydesaminokynurenine (100 nm)
were all distinctly sigmoidal, as was the percentage inhibition
graph obtained with l-kynurenine (fig. 4). a reciprocal plot
of the data acquired for the d,l-3,7-dihydroxydesaminokynurenine-inhibited enzyme clearly reveals a highly
co-operative enzyme throughout the whole substrate range,
with negative co-operativity at low concentrations, which
becomes positive as the substrate levels are increased (data
not shown). similar results were obtained by hill analysis.

discussion
the results describe the ﬁrst puriﬁcation of human recombinant  xxxg1296xxx  to homogeneity. the protein was fully

3 characterized by electrophoresis (fig. 1), maldi-tof ms
and uv absorption spectroscopy, and the data are consistent with previous reports [10,11] on the protein. the kinetic
characterization revealed that the human recombinant
 xxxg1296xxx  is speciﬁc for 3-hydroxykynurenine, with a
km of 3.0 ± 0.1 lm. this km value is much lower than
previously reported in this [11] and other laboratories [6] for
the recombinant enzyme, and this is probably because our
ﬁndings are for an enzyme displaying sigmoidal kinetics and
thus the calculated km is not the same as the michaelis
constant km but rather a sigmoidal constant ks which
incorporates an interaction factor(s) and hence is not the
substrate concentration at 50% vmax. the data are,
however, consistent with values obtained for constitutive
enzymes isolated from other species such as saccharomyces
4 cerevisiae (km ¼ 3.0 lm) [17] and the fungus penicillium
roqueforti (km ¼ 4.0 lm) [7]. soda & tanizawa [18]
reported a km value of 1.67 lm for rat hepatic  xxxg1296xxx . it was also not possible to show any activity towards
l-kynurenine, and, at the previously reported km values of
400 lm or more, there was signiﬁcant inhibition of the
enzyme. at a concentration of 250 lm l-kynurenine in the
presence of 625 nm d,l-3-hydroxykynurenine, there was
nearly 80% inhibition (fig. 4). this is a major difference of
human  xxxg1296xxx  from other mammalian enzymes, such
as rat hepatic  xxxg1296xxx , and may imply that previous
reports of weak activity with l-kynurenine in crude cell
homogenates may be the result of additional adventitious
enzyme activity. certainly the preference for 3-hydroxykynurenine must be taken into account in inhibitor design. rat
hepatic  xxxg1296xxx , on the other hand, showed activity
towards l-kynurenine, with a km of 500 lm for the partially
puriﬁed (> 80%) enzyme. differential substrate speciﬁcity
for  xxxg1296xxx  from brain and liver in mice has been
demonstrated by chiarugi et al. [19] in vivo, and this raises
the possibility of the existence of two isoforms of the enzyme
as discussed by toma et al. [8].
the ph optimum of 8.25 is consistent with previously
reported experimentally determined [6] values, and the
optimum activity of the enzyme using this potassium
phosphate buffer system showed a strong dependence on
ionic strength. molarity increases above 10–20 mm result in
a signiﬁcant fall in activity, which progressively worsens as
the ionic strength is increased.
on the basis of the sigmoidal velocity plots obtained in
the absence and presence of d,l-3,7-dihydroxydesaminokynurenine (fig. 2), the enzyme appears to be subjected to
co-operative modulation by the substrate 3-hydroxykynurenine. the mixed inhibition depicted by the lineweaver–
burk plot in fig. 3 corroborates this with its reduced vmax
and increased km. the shape of the plot is consistent with
binding of the inhibitor to both the free enzyme (e) and the
enzyme–substrate complex (es) [15] and hence it can be

scheme 3.

inferred that an additional ligand-binding site must be
present on the human enzyme.
when the lines intersect above the x-axis then ki < ki¢,
and when the lines intersect below the x-axis then ki > k 0i
(in both instances the lines have to intersect to the left of the
y-axis). the data obtained for l-kynurenine gave
ki ¼ 20 lm and ki¢ ¼ 55 lm, while the d-isomer (data
not shown) showed very similar behavior.

conclusions
the work described shows that appreciable quantities of
active recombinant human  xxxg1296xxx  can be obtained
using a baculovirus/insect cell system followed by a
straightforward puriﬁcation protocol. this provides a
relatively simple and economical method of producing
active enzyme for use in mechanistic and structural studies.
characterization of recombinant human  xxxg1296xxx 
shows that it is similar to the rat liver enzyme [4] in terms of
molecular mass, ph optimum, km and sensitivity to
analogue inhibitors, but it also has some important
differences. the human enzyme seems to be completely
speciﬁc for 3-hydroxykynurenine with no signiﬁcant activity
with kynurenine, as reported previously. this may be
important in inhibitor design. also the enzyme appears to
be subjected to substrate modulation, exhibiting sigmoidal
kinetics. this behaviour could be important in regulation of
enzyme activity in vivo and consequent channeling of
substrate 3-hydroxykynurenine down the tryptophan–
kynurenine metabolic pathway.
the puriﬁcation of recombinant human  xxxg1296xxx 
to homogeneity has allowed crystallization trials to
commence in our laboratory for elucidation of the
x-ray crystal structure of the protein. the information
obtained should provide invaluable knowledge on the
active site and also pave the way for co-crystallization of
enzyme–substrate and/or enzyme–inhibitor complexes.
these should allow further mechanistic investigation of
the catalytic reaction and hence facilitate subsequent
design and synthesis of effective inhibitors in an attempt
to combat the deleterious effects of the many serious
neurodegenerative disorders.
