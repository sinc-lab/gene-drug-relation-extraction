abstract
x-ray crystal structures of carbonic anhydrase i1 ( xxxg293xxx ) complexed with sulfonamide inhibitors illuminate the structural
determinants of high affinity binding in the nanomolar regime. the primary binding interaction is the coordination of
a primary sulfonamide group to the active site zinc ion. secondary interactions fine-tune tight binding in regions of the
active site cavity >5 a away from zinc, and this work highlights three such features: (1) advantageous conformational
restraints of a bicyclic thienothiazene-6-sulfonamide-i
,i-dioxide inhibitor skeleton in comparison with a monocyclic
2,5-thiophenedisulfonamideskeleton; (2) optimal substituents attached to a secondary sulfonamide group targeted to
interact with hydrophobic patches defined by phel31, leu198, and pr0202; and (3) optimal stereochemistry and
configuration at the c-4 position of bicyclic thienothiazene-6-sulfonamides;
the c-4 substituent can interact with his64,
the catalytic proton shuttle. structure-activity relationships rationalize affinity trends observed during the development
of  xxxd367xxx  (azopttm),the newest carbonic anhydrase inhibitor approved for the treatment of glaucoma.

human carbonic anhydrase i1 ( xxxg293xxx ; ec 4.2.1.1)is a zinc metalloenzyme of 260 amino acids that catalyzes the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to form bicarbonate ion plus a proton,
h 2 0 c 0 2 h hc03h f (silverman & lindskog, 1988;
christianson & fierke, 1996). at the base of the active site cavity,
zinc is liganded by his94, his96, his1 19, and hydroxide ion with
tetrahedral coordination geometry (hikansson et al., 1992). zincbound hydroxide donates a hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl side
chain of thr199, which in turn donates a hydrogen bond to glu106.
with k,,,/k, = 10' m" s" ,  xxxg293xxx  is one of only a handful of
enzymes that exhibits reaction kinetics approaching the limit of
diffusion control. catalytic turnover requires transfer of the product proton to bulk solvent via shuttle group his64 (tu et al., 1989).
although the carbonic anhydrase isozymes are localized in various organs, tissues, and cells throughout the body,  xxxg293xxx  is of particular pharmaceutical interest. the activity of this isozyme is linked

to increased intraocular pressure, a major symptom of glaucoma
(friedenwald, 1949; kinsey, 1953). sulfonamide  xxxg293xxx  inhibitors are
effective in the control of intraocular pressure and are therefore useful in the treatment of glaucoma (mann & keilin, 1940; becker,
1954; maren, 1987). thehigh resolution crystal structures of  xxxg293xxx 
(hikansson et al., 1992) and various sulfonamide inhibitor complexes show that an ionized sulfonamide nitrogen displaces zincbound hydroxide to form a stable enzyme-inhibitor complex with
submicromolar to nanomolar affinity (baldwin et al., 1989; vidgren
et al., 1990; prugh et al., 1991;bunn et al., 1994; hikansson & liljas, 1994; jain et al., 1994; smith et al., 1994; boriack et al., 1995;
stams et al., 1998). valuable insight on enzyme-inhibitor affinity is
gained by studying these structures, and this insight is critical for
understanding the molecular action of  xxxd367xxx  (azopttm;stams
et al., 1998), the newest carbonic anhydrase inhibitor approved for
the treatment of glaucoma.
here, we report the crystal structure determinations of caiiinhibitor complexes that illuminate specific affinity determinants
in the  xxxg293xxx  active site explored during the development of  xxxd367xxx . the inhibitors found in table 1 are novel in comparison
with other  xxxg293xxx  inhibitors reported to date, in that they contain two
sulfonamide groups: a primary sulfonamide targeted for the critical
zinc coordination interaction, and a secondary sulfonamide through
which various n-substituted functional groups modulate enzymeinhibitorinteractions (fig. 1). thestructures of these  xxxg293xxx -

fig. 1. general scheme of sulfonamide inhibitor binding to  xxxg293xxx .in this
paper, the term “primary sulfonamide” refers to the group that ionizes and
coordinates to the active site zinc ion and hydrogen bonds with -199.
theterm“secondarysulfonamide”refers
to the group withthe di- or
tri-substitutednitrogenatomthatinteractswithsecondarybindingsite
determinants in the  xxxg293xxx  active site, such as phel31, pr0202, leu198,
glu92, and/or his64.

inhibitor complexes allowfor the rationalization of affiity trends
observed early on in the exploration of inhibitor designs.

ular interactions of the primary sulfonamide group are indicated
schematically in figure 1.
the primary sulfonamide group is connected to the c-2 atom
of
a thiophene ringin all inhibitors studied,so the resulting thiophene2-sulfonamide comprises a molecular core that is common to all
the inhibitorsin table 1. derivatizationof this core by substituting
different functional groupson the secondary sulfonamide group at

ring to thiophene atoms c-4 and c-5, results in  xxxg293xxx  inhibitors
with varied affinity properties. stereochemical and configurational
variations at the c-4 position
of thienothiazine-6-sulfonamide-l,1dioxides also modulate enzyme-inhibitor affinity. resultantly, inhibitor affinity is modulated by designvariations at secondary sites
somewhat distant ( x a) from the primarysite. the remainder of
this section outlinesthree different secondary inhibitor design features that influence structure-affinity relationships.

given the potential importance of a c-4 substituent in triggering
the conformational change ofhis64, we determined the structures
ofthe  xxxg293xxx  complexeswithinhibitorsal7182,al7089,and
al7099 to ascertain the precise contribution of this substituent and
its stereochemistry on enzyme-inhibitor affinity. interactions between the primary sulfonamide and zinc, and the secondary sulfonamide methoxyphenyl substituent and phel3 1, are maintained
among all three inhibitors. additionally, the side chain
of his64 is
displaced to the “out” conformation in all three complexes (even
though it is not sterically forced
to be so in the  xxxg293xxx - xxxd1142xxx 
complex). however, the conformations of the six-membered thiazine rings are quite different (fig.

this difference may contribute to the
lower affiity of al7099.
the stereochemistry of the c-4 methylamino group affects the
binding conformation of the inhibitor as reflected by the orientation of the thiophene rings of al7089, al7099, and  xxxd1142xxx  relativetotheprimarysulfonamidegroup.thebindingmode
of
al7 182 illustrates the preferred position and conformation
of the
thienothiazene-6-sulfonamide-1,l-dioxide ring system in the absence of a c-4 substituent. the additionof a methylamino group
with r stereochemistry (al7089) changes the orientation of the

thiophene ring by 10" (fig. 5). the essentially equal affinities of
al7089 and  xxxd1142xxx  (table1) suggest that the energetic benefit
of
any additional contact surface area provided by the c-4 substituent, as well as thepossibleenergeticbenefit
oftriggeringthe
conformational changeof his64 to the "out" position, is offset by
the slight change in the orientation
ofthethiophenering.
the
addition of a methylamino group with

changes the orientationof the thiophene ring by 20". however, the
affi~nityof al7099is 17-fold weaker than that of al7 182. clearly,
this stereochemistry and conformation cannotbe easily accommodated in the  xxxg293xxx  active site.

conclusions
structure-affinity relationships discernedin the current study are
approximations, since other factors such as desolvation and conformational differences betweenfree and complexed enzyme and
inhibitor are not taken into account. nevertheless, it is clear that
the bicyclic thienothiazene-6-sulfonamide-l , 1-dioxidering system comprises a superior molecular scaffolding that can easily
be derivatized and optimized for high-affiity binding to  xxxg293xxx .
secondaryenzyme-inhibitorinteractions >5 a awayfrom the
active site zinc ion can be targeted by derivatization of the secondary sulfonamide group with aromatic or aliphatic substituents
that interact with hydrophobic patches largely defined by phel31,
leu198, and f'r0202. the conformation and interactions ofthe
secondary sulfonamide group itself appear to be much less important than the interactions of the functional groups attached to
it. in particular,thearomatic-aromaticedge-to-faceinteraction

materials and methods
crystals of recombinant  xxxg293xxx  were grown using the sitting drop
method, requiring the addition of a 5 p l drop containing 6.7-7.4
mg/ml enzyme and 50 mm tris-hc1 (ph 8.0 at room temperature) to a 5 p l drop containing 50 mm tris-hc1with 1.75-2.50 m
ammonium sulfate (ph 8.0 at room temperature) in the crystallization well. for each crystallization trial, the enzyme drops were
saturated with methyl mercuric acetate to promote the growth of
diffraction quality parallelepipedons within two weeks
inhibitors were synthesized using standard techniques; full details of the synthesis, molecular characterization, enzymology, and
pharmacology will be reported at a later date (t. dean, unpubl.
results). inhibition of  xxxg293xxx  was determined using published techniques (chen & kernohan, 1967; ponticello et al., 1987). no unusual or slow binding kinetics were observed for any of theinhibitors
studied.
 xxxg293xxx -inhibitor complexes were prepared by soaking crystals in
buffer solutions containing inhibitors. prior to crystal soaking experiments, crystals were transferred to a buffer solution of 4.0 m
k2hp04 (ph = 10.0) and cross-linked with 0.1% (vol/vol) gluteraldehyde for 6-8 h. subsequently, crystals were transferred over
a period of2-7 days into a buffer solution containing 4-8 mm
inhibitor dissolved in dmso such that the final concentration of
dmso in the crystal soaking solution was less then 10% (vol/vol).
after soaking in inhibitor solutions for 1-2 weeks, crystals were
harvested, mounted, and sealed in 0.5 or 0.7 mm glass capillaries
with a small portion of mother liquor.
x-ray diffraction data were collected using either a siemens
x-100a multiwire area detector or an r-axis iic image plate
detector (molecular structure corporation, the woodlands, texas).
a rigaku ru-200hb rotating anode x-ray generator equipped
with double focusing mirrors supplied cu-k, radiation. all x-ray
diffraction data were collected at room temperature by the oscillation method. intensity data were processed with mosflm and
ccp4 programs (leslie, 1992; ccp4, 1994). all crystals belonged
to space group p2, with typical unit cell parameters a = 42.7 a,
h = 41.7 a, c = 73.0 a, and p = 104.6'.
the structure of refined human  xxxg293xxx  (hikansson etal., 1992) was
the starting point for refinement with x-plor (briinger et al., 1987).
inhibitor atoms and active site solvent molecules were added and
refined when the crystallographic r-factor dropped below 0.200. the
refinement of each enzyme-inhibitor complex converged smoothly
to low final crystallographic r-factors and each final model exhibited good stereochemistry.pertinent refinement statistics for all caiiinhibitor structures are recorded in table 2, and the coordinates of
all  xxxg293xxx -inhibitor complexes have been deposited in the brookhaven protein data bank (accession codes are listed in table 1).
