peroxynitrite-induced nitrotyrosination of proteins is blocked by direct  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor  xxxd3554xxx .  we have previously shown that the ability of overnight pretreatment with lipopolysaccharide (lps) to suppress alveolar macrophage (am) leukotrienes (lt) synthesis is explained by induction of  xxxd2738xxx  (no), and reactive oxygen intermediates (roi). more recently we have demonstrated that the generation of peroxynitrite (onoo-) from the combination of no and roi directly nitrotyrosinates the  xxxg147xxx  ( xxxg147xxx ) enzyme and reduces cell-free and intact am  xxxg147xxx  metabolism. this effect of onoo- was associated with nitrotyrosination of the  xxxg147xxx  enzyme in intact cells and after treatment of recombinant enzyme. we postulated that lps treatment of cells resulted in activation of  xxxg147xxx  with the generation of roi, which in turn led to autoinactivation of the enzyme. in an effort to suppress roi generated from activation of  xxxg147xxx  we examined the effect of a direct  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor on lps-induced suppression of lt synthesis. coincubation with the reversible  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor  xxxd3554xxx  during the lps pretreatment of intact cells dose dependently blocked the inhibition of  xxxg147xxx  metabolism by lps. the effect of  xxxd3554xxx  on lps-induced suppression of lt synthesis was similar to that of  xxxd3291xxx .  xxxd3554xxx  had no effect on inducible  xxxd2738xxx  synthase induction. interestingly,  xxxd3554xxx  blocked onoo--induced nitrotyrosination of recombinant  xxxg147xxx  in a cell-free system as well as of native enzyme in intact cells. moreover,  xxxd3554xxx  blocked the nitrotyrosination of other proteins. we conclude that the suppression of  xxxg147xxx  activity occurring with lps treatment can be blocked by  xxxd3554xxx . the mechanism by which  xxxd3554xxx  is effective is in part explained by blocking nitrotyrosination of  xxxg147xxx .
