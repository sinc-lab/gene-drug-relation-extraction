changes in sensitivity to anticancer drugs during tpa-induced cellular differentiation in a human t-lymphoblastoid cell line (molt-4).  after four days of treatment with 10(-8) m tpa, differentiation of the human t-lymphoblastoid cell line molt-4 was induced along the t cell lineage, confirmed by a fall in  xxxg62xxx  and 5'-ectonucleotidase and a rise in purine  xxxg1792xxx  activity. tpa-treated cells became resistant to the cytotoxic effects of 1-beta-d- xxxd1790xxx  ( xxxd1790xxx ), 9-beta-d-arabinofuranosyladenine (ara-a), and  xxxd1712xxx . this was, in part, due to the altered cell cycle distribution (accumulation of cells in the g1 phase), since the toxicity of  xxxd1790xxx  and ara-a is s phase specific. the diminished rate of  xxxd1790xxx  transport concomitant with ara-ctp formation after tpa treatment is considered to be the biochemical basis for this acquired resistance.
