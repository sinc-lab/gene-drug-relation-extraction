in the rat: a comparison with structurally related compounds. meredith,

s. (1985). toxicol. appl. pharmacol.
77, 315-324. the effects of
 xxxd2744xxx  (a new hr-receptor antagonist) and of related compounds were studied on oxidative
drug metabolism in the rat both in vivo and in vitro.  xxxd2744xxx  is a structural analog of the
hz-receptor antagonists ici 125,211 (tiotidine) and ranitidine (zantac).  xxxd2744xxx  (120 mgj
kg, ip) had no effect on the [‘4c]aminopyrine (abt) or [‘4c]caffeine breath (cbt) tests, nor
on the clearance from plasma of aminopyrine despite high tissue and plasma concentrations
of  xxxd2744xxx . binding of niratidine (1 mm) to rat hepatic microsomal p-450 determined by
spectral analysis was not observed. in vitro aminopyrine demethylation was inhibited by
 xxxd2744xxx  only at high concentrations (k, = 92 mm). cimetidine, ici 125,211, and imidazole
bind avidly to rat hepatic microsomal cytochrome p-450 and are potent inhibitors of
aminopyrine demethylation in vitro. imidazole inhibited the aminopytine breath test, while
imidazole, ranitidine, and ici 125,2 11 inhibited the caffeine breath in vivo. these data indicate
that  xxxd2744xxx  has no acute inhibitory effect on hepatic oxidative drug metabolism in the rat,
both in vitro and in vivo. the composite structural-activity data suggest that inhibition of in
vivo oxidative drug metabolism by hz-antagonists may not depend primarily on either the
imidazole ring side chain or the thiazole ring per se. furthermore, the in vivo inhibition may
not correlate with in vitro data. 8 1985 academic press, inc.

 xxxd2744xxx  ( xxxd2744xxx ) is a new hz-receptor
antagonist which is currently undergoing
clinical trials. the molecule is an analog of
other potent hi-antagonists,
including the
thiazole ring of ici 125,211 (tiotidine) and
the ring side chains of ranitidine (zantac)
(fig. 1). ici 125,211 consists of a 2-guanidinosubstituted thiazole and the cyano-substituted
guanidino-(methylthio)ethyl
side chain of cimetidine (tagamet) (fig. 1). ici 125,211 is
a potent long-acting hz-receptor antagonist
but was removed from testing after reports
of malignant
antral lesions in rats with
chronic oral dosing. in contrast, ranitidine
has a (dimethylamino)methyl-substituted

furan ring and the side chain of cimetidine,
but with a nitro-substituted rather than cyanosubstituted guanidine (fig. 1). unpublished
data (clinial investigation manual, eli lilly
and co.) suggest that  xxxd2744xxx  on a molar
basis is five to six times more potent than
cimetidine in reducing basal gastric acid output in the rat, dog, and man. therefore,
 xxxd2744xxx  appears to have an hz-receptor
antagonist potency similar to ranitidine.
cimetidine, the prototype hz-antagonist,
is a 4,5-substituted imidazole which binds
reversibly to rat liver microsomal cytochrome
p-450 and is an inhibitor of hepatic drug
metabolism in man (serlin et ul, 1979; flind,

aminopyrine and  xxxd404xxx  breath tests in vivo. the
methods for the abt and cbt were as described pre
viously (desmond et al., 1980b). air flow rate to each
chamber was equalized with a flow meter. the test was
started immediately following ip injection of 0.25 ml of
[‘%$uninopyrine (6.1 nmol) or [“c]cal%eine (12.6 nmol).
the expired gas was drawn through concentrated sulfuric
acid to remove water and then bubbled through a
scintillation vial containing 10 ml of a 2/l (v/v) methanol/
ethanolamine mixture to trap all expired co,. samples
were collected for 15-min periods over 2.5 hr. trapped
radioactivity (‘4coz) was measured by liquid scintillation
spectroscopy. the eliminiation of expired “co* was
calculated as the cumulative percentage (% dpm) of the
injected dose. control breath tests were recorded in rats
24 hr prior to dosing (ip) with  xxxd2744xxx  (120 mg/kg or
0.362 mmol/kg), ici 125,211 (100 mg/kg or 0.320

 xxxd2744xxx -treated rats were fitly anesthetized with ether
at 1 hr after dosing with  xxxd2744xxx  (120 mg/kg, ip).
aminopyrine (30 mg/kg in normal saline) was injected
into an exposed femoral vein and the animal was placed
in a restraining cage. body temperature was maintained
by a heated pad, and the animals were allowed to recover
from the ether. serial heparinized blood samples (100
~1) were collected from the tail at 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 45,
60,90, 105, and 120 min after aminopyrine administration. the concentration of aminopyrine in plasma was
determined by high-performance liquid chromatography
(lockwood and houston, 1979).
the plasma elimination time course of aminopyrine
can be described best by a two-compartment open
model. the apparent rate constant of elimination, 8,
was determined from the terminal monoexponential
curve using a modified version of an iterative nonlinear
least-squares regression computer program, with proportional standard deviation weighting (duggleby, 1980).
area under the plasma concentration time curve was
estimated by the trapezoidal rule and extrapolated @

plasma and hepatic tissue concentrations of  xxxd2744xxx .
the concentration of  xxxd2744xxx  in plasma was recorded
in two rats after ip dosing (120 mg/kg), without ether
anesthesia. the animals were placed in restraining cages,
and blood samples (100 ~1) were collected at 5, 10, 20,
30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, and 120 min from the tail as
described above. the concentration of  xxxd2744xxx  was
determined by hplc using the extraction method described by lorenzo and drayer (1981) and the chro-

317

matographic method of randolph et al. (1977).  xxxd2622xxx  was added to each sample as internal standard, and
peak height ratios were used to estimate the  xxxd2744xxx 
concentration from a standard curve (extracted in tat
serum). the mobile phase (2.0 ml/min) was acetonitrile/
methanol/water/ammonium
hydroxide, 50/3/l/2.5 (v/
v). retention times were 5 min for  xxxd2744xxx  and 4 min
for  xxxd2622xxx  on a pporasil column. the plasma concentration time course of  xxxd2744xxx  after ip dosing was
described best by a one-compartment absorption model.
the curves were examined using the least-squares regression program in terms of the relationship
cp = [k,$xo/v(k,, - k&j x (e-” - e-4,
where k,, is the apparent first-order absorption rate
constant, f is the bioavailability (f = 1 assumed for ip
administration), xo is the dose, k, is the apparent firstorder elimination rate constant, t is the time, and v is
the apparent volume of distribution (gibaldi and pertier,
1982). clearance from plasma was determined using
model-independent methods as described.
three rats were terminated by decapitation  xxxd1891xxx , 60,
and 120 min after dosing with 120 mg/kg  xxxd2744xxx  ip.
the liver was perfused in situ via the portal vein with
saline and then removed and weighed. liver homogenates
were prepared in 10 vol distilled water using a glass
homogenizer and a polytron blender. duplicate 5-ml
aliquots of these homogenates were extracted as described
previously.  xxxd2622xxx  was added to each sample as an
internal standard. a standard curve for  xxxd2744xxx  was
prepared using 5-ml aliquots of liver homogenate from
a nontreated rat. the concentration of  xxxd2744xxx  in liver
tissue was determined per mill&ram liver protein. protein

bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard.
microsomal aminopyrine n-demethylase activity in
vitro. rats were decapitated, and the liver was perfused
in situ with ice-cold normal saline. the liver was homogenized in 5 ~010.15 m kc1 and centrifuged at 8000g
for 15 min (4°c). the supematant fraction was further
centrifuged at 18,ooogfor 15 min (4’c), and the microsomal pellet was isolated from the 18,ooogsupematant
fraction by ultracentrifugation at 105,ooogfor 60 min.
the pellet was resuspended in 0.1 m phosphate buffer
(ph 7.4) to a protein concentration of i to 2 mg/ml in
a polytron blender. aminopyrine ndemethylase (apnd)
activity was determined according to the method of
litterst et al. (1975). the concentration of formaldehyde
was determined by the nash method (1953) as modified
by cochin and axelrod (1959). the inhibition of apnd
was examined with increasing concentrations of  xxxd2744xxx 
(i to 10 mm), cimetidine (0.1 to 5 mm), or imidazole
(0.1 to 10 mm). the zc50 was determined born a plot
of percentage inhibition of control vs log concentrations
of the inhibitor. michaelis kinetics were determined for
aminopyrine with and without  xxxd2744xxx  (10 mm) and
imidazole (1 mm). the apparent v,,,, and k,,, were

the concentration of
cytochrome p-450 in microsomal preparations was determined by the method of omura and sato (1964).
samples were gassed with co, and the absorbance
(aminco dw-2 spectrophotometer) was determined at
450 nm relative to 490 nm after the addition of a few
grains of sodium dithionite. the final concentration of
cytochrome p-450 was estimated with a mmolar extinction coefficient of 9 1.
spectral binding. the binding of  xxxd2744xxx , cimetidine,
imidazole, and ici 125,211 to rat hepatic microsomes
were examined by spectral difference. microsomal preparations were diluted in 0. i m phosphate buffer (ph 7.4).
the difference spectra were recorded in an aminco dw2 spectrophotometer scanning 370 to 500 nm after
addition of increasing concentrations of the test compound to the sample cuvette and an equal volume of
buffer (10 ~1) to the reference cuvette. all studies were
conducted at room temperature (approx. 25°c). the
change in absorbance, a&anm (relative to the isosbestic
point) with substrate concentration, [s], was analyzed in
terms of the relationship

markedly inhibited the n-demethylation
of
aminopyrine (50% at 60 min) and caffeine
(57%). ranitidine also inhibited the cbt by
39% at 60 min (fig. 2b).

discussion
the main aim of this study was to examine
in the rat the influence of  xxxd2744xxx  on
hepatic oxidative drug metabolism.
the
breath tests revealed that  xxxd2744xxx  had no
effect on aminopyrine or caffeine n-demethylation in vivo, despite the high plasma and
hepatic concentrations of  xxxd2744xxx . much
lower concentrations of cimetidine in rat
plasma and liver resulted in inhibition
of
drug oxidation (speeg et al., 1982). in addition,  xxxd2744xxx  had no acute effect on the
disposition of aminopyrine in vivo (table 2).
this observation correlated with the poor
inhibitory potency of  xxxd2744xxx  on aminopyrine n-demethylation
in vitro (k; = 92
mm) (fig. 6) and apparent absence of spectral
affinity for cytochrome p-450 (table 3). these
data on  xxxd2744xxx  are consistent with recent
observations which show that  xxxd2744xxx  has
minimal effect on the clearance of lidocaine
(oxidation) in perfused rat hepatic preparations, that is, less inhibition was found than
with an equivalent dose of ranitidine (r.
roberts, c. heath, and s. schenker, personal
communication).
in this respect, the effect of
 xxxd2744xxx  in vivo appeared similar to, or less

than, ranitidine (speeg et al., 1982), and this
effect was not unexpected given the similarity
of the ring side chains of the two drugs (fig.
1). ranitidine significantly inhibited the cbt
(39%) (fig. 2b); but, since this drug has no
effect on theophylline
clearance in man
(breen et al., 1982), this effect may be a
consequence of the high doses used in this
study. further studies with  xxxd2744xxx  are
needed and are currently being undertaken
to exclude drug-drug interactions in man.
however, there has been generally a good
correlation in the past between the effects of
hz-antagonists on oxidative drug metabolism
in rodents and in man, as seen with cimetidine and ranitidine (speeg et al., 1982; breen
et al., 1982; desmond et al., 1980a, 1980b).
the second part of this study included the
use of the unique molecular structure of
 xxxd2744xxx  to compare its interaction and that
of related hz-receptor antagonists with hepatic
cytochrome mixed-function
oxidases. while
the molecular mechanism(s) for the inhibition
of cytochrome-mediated
oxidative drug metabolism by the hz-receptor antagonists is
not certain, it is thought to involve a reversible
interaction with cytochrome p-450. the type
ii optical difference spectrum, such as seen
with cimetidine,
ici 125,2 11,  xxxd2622xxx ,
and imidazole, is believed to represent bindtable 2

ing of the ligand to the ferric form of cytochrome p-450 as a sixth ligand, with the
formation of a ferrihemochrome (schenkman
et al., 1967). data obtained by spectral binding and electron spin resonance (esr) spectroscopy using a variety of substituted imidazoles suggest that either the imidazole ring
or the cyano group of cimetidine (fig. 1)
may interact as the sixth ligand (rendic et
al., 1983). the results from the esr studies
led rendic et al. (1983) to suggest that the
cyano group may be the more important
ligand. however, these data are confounded
by the observations that imidazole (which
has no cyano group) has an apparent heterogeneous spectral interaction with rat hepatic
microsomes, with k, values similar to cimetidine (fig. 7, table 3). imidazole also markedly inhibited both aminopyrine and caffeine
n-demethylation
in vivo (figs. 2a and b;
table 1), as well as aminopyrine n-demethylase in vitro (figs. 4 and 5). these data,
therefore, suggest that the ring side chain,
particularly the cyano-substituted guanidino
group, of cimetidine may be less important
for inhibition of drug metabolism than previously indicated.
ici 1252 11 has a guanidino-substituted
thiazole and the cyano-substituted guanidine
side chain of cimetidine (fig. 1). like cimetidine, it is bound avidly to microsomal
cytochrome p-450 with two apparent binding
sites (fig. 3; table 3). however, while the

affinity of ici 125,2 11 for cytochrome p-450
was greater compared to cimetidine, the inhibition of aminopyrine
demethylation
in
vitro, on a molar basis, was less for ici
125,211 (speeg et al., 1982). in addition, ici
125,211 is a less potent inhibitor of the cbt
than imidazole (fig. 2b; table 1) and did
not impair the abt (fig. 2a; table 1) (speeg
et al., 1982). thus, for ici 125,2 11 unlike
cimetidine and imidazole, there is an apparent
dissociation between the high-affinity binding
to microsomal cytochrome p-450 measured
by spectral analysis and the potency of the
drug as an inhibitor of oxidative drug metabolism in vitro and in vivo.
the absence of spectral binding and the
inhibition
of cytochrome p-450 oxidative
drug metabolism by  xxxd2744xxx  (which contains the thiazole ring) suggest that the thiazole ring of ici 125,211 plays little, if any,
role in such interactions. however, differences
in the thiazole side chains may alter unpaired
electron fields within the ring (i.e., the nitrogen and sulfur). it is difficult, therefore, to
know whether the guanidino-thiazole
or the
cyano-substituted guanidine determines the
high spectral affinity of ici 125,2 11. guanidine, as the hydrochloride salt, does not

microsomal cytochrome p-450 in concentrations of 1 @a to 1 iiim (unpublished data).
further studies, particularly esr spectroscopy
with other substituted guanidines and imidazoles, will be necessary to resolve these
issues.
the spectral interaction of the compounds
used in this study with rat hepatic microsomes
is complex, as demonstrated by the scatchard
plots of fig. 7. several possible reasons for
this pattern have been proposed, including

direct partition equilibrium
studies with cimetidine indicate that negative cooperativity
is unlikely (reilly et al., 1983). in addition,
the heterogeneous interaction of imidazole
with purified microsomal cytochrome p-450
(p-450lm2 and p-450lm4) (hajek et al.,
1982) suggests that different isozymes of cytochrome p-450 are not responsible for the

spectral interaction observed with the hzreceptor antagonists. thus, the heterogeneous
interaction described by the dissociation constants, ks1and ks2, may represent two binding
sites with low and high affinities, or perhaps
different areas of the ligand binding to one
or more sites with different affinities. similar
two-component binding has been reported
for  xxxd2622xxx  (table 3) (speeg et al., 1982).
in contrast, one apparent binding site (low
affinity) has been described for ranitidine (ks
= 1.8 inm) (rendic et al., 1983) and cimetidine sulfoxide (ks = 1.28 mm) (speeg et al.,
1982), and these compounds are poor inhibitors of aminopyrine ndemethylation
in vitro
(table 3). hence, the nature of the spectral
interaction may be used to predict the potency
of the hz-receptor antagonists as inhibitors
of oxidative drug metabolism in vitro; that
is, compounds with micromolar spectral affinity may be generally expected to inhibit
oxidative drug metabolism in vitro. this conclusion, however, may not be extrapolated
to in vivo effects, as illustrated by ici 125,211.

made. first, inhibition
of aminopyrine
ivdemethylase in vitro tended to be more competitive with imidazole and imidazole-substituted compounds, i.e., cimetidine and  xxxd2622xxx , while ici 125,211, ranitidine, and
 xxxd2744xxx  (non-imidazole
compounds) appear noncompetitive (figs. 6a and b) (speeg
et al., 1982; wilkinson et al., 1974). this
difference suggests that there may be differences between hz-antagonists in their interaction and inhibition
of the isozymes of
cytochrome p-450/448. however, considerable overlap makes interpretation
difficult.
second, the cbt was affected to a greater
extent than the abt (figs. 2a and b). this
difference could be due to a relative lower
activity of the microsomal isozyme(s) responsible for caffeine n-demethylation
compared
to aminopyrine n-demethylation
or an increased affmity of the inhibitor for the caffeine
related isozyme(s).
note added in proqf: recently, in man we have shown
no effect of  xxxd2744xxx  on the elimination of chlordiazepoxide and theophylline from plasma.
