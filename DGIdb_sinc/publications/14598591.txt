[clotting factor viii in sneddon syndrome].  hyperactivity of  xxxg751xxx  ( xxxg751xxx ) marks hypercoagulation.  xxxg751xxx  enhances activity of  xxxg752xxx  and their combination activates  xxxg741xxx , which is of primary importance in prothrombin transformation into thrombin, on the phospholipid membrane. the activity of  xxxg751xxx  was studied in 28 patients (26 women, 2 men, mean age 49.6 +/- 7.8 years) with sneddon's syndrome (ss). ss manifests clinically similarly to primary antiphospholipid syndrome (pas). the leading of them are ischemic disorders of cerebral circulation (idcc) and advanced livedo present in all the examinees. hyperactivity of  xxxg751xxx  was registered in 21 (75%) of 28 patients. most of thrombosis-related symptoms occurred more frequently in patients with high than normal activity of  xxxg751xxx : ischemic strokes (91% vs 57%, p > 0.05), repeated strokes (71% vs 0%, p = 0.0014), transient idcc (76% vs 57%, p > 0.05), vascular dementia (43% vs 0%, p > 0.05), ischemic heart disease (43% vs 0%, p > 0.05), thickening of heart valves according to echocardiography (91% vs 57%, p > 0.05), peripheral venous thromboses (24% vs 0%, p > 0.05). in high  xxxg751xxx  activity cardiolipin antibodies occurred more rarely (24% vs 43%, p > 0.05) but lupus anticoagulant was seen more often (47% vs 14%, p > 0.05). high  xxxg751xxx  activity was in 8 of 12 apl-negative patients. it is demonstrated that elevated  xxxg751xxx  activity is an essential mechanism of thrombosis development in ss. the cause of this enhanced activity is suggested to be special apl in interaction with which  xxxg751xxx  becomes insensitive to inactivation with protein c. the activity of protein c was normal in all the cases.
