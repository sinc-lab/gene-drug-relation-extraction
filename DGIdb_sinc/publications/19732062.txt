long-term use of most organic nitrates is limited by development of tolerance, induction of oxidative stress and endothelial
dysfunction. in this issue of the bjp, schuhmacher et al. characterized a novel class of organic nitrates with amino moieties
(aminoalkyl nitrates). aminoethyl nitrate was identified as a novel organic mononitrate with high potency but devoid of
induction of mitochondrial oxidative stress. cross-tolerance to nitroglycerin or the endothelium-dependent agonist acetylcholine after in vivo treatment was not observed. like all nitrates, aminoethyl nitrate induced vasorelaxation by activation of soluble
 xxxg1587xxx . thus, in contrast to the prevailing view, high potency in an organic nitrate is not necessarily accompanied
by induction of oxidative stress or endothelial dysfunction. this work from daiber’s group is an important step forward in the
understanding of nitrate bioactivation, tolerance phenomena and towards the development of better organic nitrates for
clinical use.

organic nitrates are still an important part of the therapeutic
armamentarium in symptomatic patients with coronary
artery disease. mechanistically, by liberation of  xxxd2738xxx 
(no) or a related molecule, nitrates stimulate soluble  xxxg1587xxx  (sgc) in smooth muscle cells, leading to
enhanced formation of cyclic  xxxd1067xxx 
(cgmp) and relaxation, thus replacing the diminished endogenous vasodilator capacity. although there is no data to show
prognostic improvement by use of organic nitrates in coronary artery disease, the symptomatic effectiveness during an
acute episode of angina pectoris is well proven and seen by
physicians on a daily basis. more problematic is the long-term
use of organic nitrates, which is limited by side effects, such as
headache, as well as by development of tolerance associated
with impaired efficiency to prevent episodes of angina. furthermore, the induction of oxidative stress and endothelial
dysfunction demonstrated during long-term treatment with
organic nitrates with the suspicion of potential aggravation of
atherosclerosis has led to some reluctance to use these compounds (munzel et al., 2007). while considerable efforts have
been made to find novel compounds stimulating the

no/sgc/cgmp axis, such as enhancers of endogenous endothelial no synthase, activators of sgc or inhibitors of phosphodiesterases (schafer et al., 2006; fraccarollo et al., 2008), so
far, none of these drugs have been proven useful to replace
nitrates in treatment of patients with symptomatic coronary
artery disease.
however, research efforts during the last years revealed that
there are considerable differences among organic nitrates
with regard to development of tolerance, as well as induction
of endothelial dysfunction. münzel’s group, as well as that of
parker, have published seminal papers demonstrating in mice
and man that the induction of vascular tolerance and oxidative stress during long-term exposure to nitrates such as nitroglycerin and isosorbide-5-mononitrate is not shared by other
nitrates, such as pentaerithrityl tetranitrate (petn) (münzel
et al., 1996; thomas et al., 2007; thum et al., 2007). in addition to the considerable importance for the clinical application of organic nitrates, these research efforts also generated
novel concepts in terms of nitrate bioactivation and the
development of tolerance (sydow et al., 2004).
in this issue of the british journal of pharmacology, schuhmacher et al. (2009) describe the characterization of a novel
class of organic nitrates with amino moieties (aminoalkyl
nitrates) (see figure 1). their results challenge traditional concepts regarding nitrate bioactivation and tolerance development. aminoethyl nitrate was characterized as a novel

figure 1 bioactivation, mitochondrial effects and mechanisms of vasodilatation induced by aminoethyl nitrate (aen) and other organic
nitrates in the study of schuhmacher et al. (2009). both the highly potent nitroglycerin (gtn) and the less potent triethanolamine trinitrate
(tean) are bioactivated by mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (mtaldh) and produce considerable amounts of mitochondrial reactive
oxygen and nitrogen species (ros/rns, most probably peroxynitrite). in contrast, the trinitrate metabolite of pentaerithrityl tetranitrate,
petrin, also bioactivated by the mtaldh, did not induce mitochondrial oxidative stress. none of the mononitrates was bioactivated by
mtaldh. nevertheless, aen was almost as potent as gtn and much more potent than methyl-3-nitrooxypropanoate (npme), which showed
significantly higher vasodilator potency than isopropyl nitrate (ipm). none of the mononitrates increased ros/rns levels in isolated
mitochondria. whether aen, npme and ipm undergo mitochondrial metabolism remains to be established. aen-induced vasodilatation was
attenuated by the no scavenger 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (ptio) and the inhibitor of soluble  xxxg1587xxx ,
ns2028. the lack of effect of  xxxd2640xxx  on aen-induced relaxation makes it unlikely that aen was metabolized by cytochrome p450 enzymes.
attenuation of aen-induced relaxation by allopurinol indicated that  xxxg2431xxx  (xo) may be involved in bioactivation of aen.

organic mononitrate with high potency but devoid of induction of mitochondrial oxidative stress and cross-tolerance to
nitroglycerin or the endothelium-dependent agonist acetylcholine after in vivo treatment. although the intermediate
role of no for nitroglycerin-induced vasorelaxation has been
questioned (kleschyov et al., 2003), aminoethyl nitrate, like
most nitrates, elicited vasorelaxation by the liberation of no
(proven by use of the no scavenger 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide) and sgc stimulation
(proven by use of the selective sgc inhibitor ns2028,
figure 1).
as the nitrates were delivered by osmotic minipumps,
important questions of enteral uptake and the bioavailability
after oral application remain to be settled. furthermore, the
bioactivation pathway is not unequivocally defined, but does
not appear to involve aldehyde dehydrogenase or cytochrome
p450 enzymes. aminoethyl nitrate did not cause tolerance to
any of the other vasodilators tested, but did induce in vivo
tolerance to itself, implying that aminoethyl nitrate has its
own bioactivation system. however, the metabolism of aminoethyl nitrate was apparently not inactivated by other
nitrates or oxidative stress, as nitroglycerin therapy in vivo did
not induce cross-tolerance to aminoethyl nitrate. this work
from daiber’s group is an important advance in our fuller
understanding of nitrate bioactivation, of tolerance phenomena, and, from the view of drug discovery, an important step
towards the development of better organic nitrates for clinical
application.
