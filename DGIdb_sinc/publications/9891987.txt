abstract glucocorticoids (gcs) influence a great variety of
cellular functions by at least three important modes of action: the
activation (or repression) of genes controlled by binding sites for
the  xxxg1601xxx  (gr), the induction of apoptosis in
lymphocytes and the recently discovered cross-talk to other
transcription factors such as nf-u
ub. in this study we systematically compared various natural and synthetic steroid hormones
frequently used as therapeutic agents on their ability to mediate
these three modes of action. betamethasone, triamcinolone,
dexamethasone and  xxxd1719xxx  turned out to be the best inducers
of gene expression and apoptosis. all gcs including the
antagonistic compound ru486 efficiently reduced nf-u
ubmediated transactivation to comparable extents, suggesting that
ligand-induced nuclear localization of the gr is sufficient for
transrepression. glucocorticoid treatment of cells did not result
in elevated iu
ub-k
k expression, but impaired the tumor necrosis
factor (tnf)-k
k-induced degradation of iu
ub-k
k without affecting
dna binding of nf-u
ub. the structural requirements for the
various functions of glucocorticoids are discussed.

1. introduction
the physiological and therapeutic e¡ects of steroid hormones and glucocorticoids (gcs) rely on direct posttranscriptional and pharmacological e¡ects and, more importantly, on
their ability to in£uence gene expression. this is achieved by
binding of the hormone to transcription factors belonging to
the family of steroid hormone receptors. among those is the
 xxxg1601xxx  (gr), which in its resting state is associated with heat shock proteins and one  xxxg799xxx  immunophilin
molecule in the cytoplasm of cells [1]. heat shock protein 90
acts as a chaperone and allows binding of the hormone, which
then leads to the nuclear translocation of the gr complex.
once in the nucleus, the gr can utilize several di¡erent mechanisms in order to in£uence gene expression [2]. upon binding
as a homodimer to the so-called glucocorticoid-response elements (gres) or negative gres (ngres) it can induce or
repress the transcription of target genes. some genes lacking

gres or ngres in their promoters can still be a¡ected by
gcs. this ¢nding is explained by functional interactions of
the gr with other transcription factors such as  xxxg1222xxx , creb,
c/ebp, octamer binding factors,  xxxg2216xxx  and nf-ub [3]. the
interaction of the gr with ap-1 and nf-ub is of special
interest, since it provides a further mechanism to explain the
clinically relevant anti-in£ammatory and immunosuppressive
properties of gcs [4]. similar to the gr, nf-ub is also
mainly regulated by compartmentalization. inactive nf-ub
resides in the cytoplasm by binding to one inhibitory iub
protein [5]. a wide range of pro-in£ammatory signals including  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-k, il-1 and reactive oxygen
intermediates results in the induced phosphorylation and
ubiquitinylation of iub, which tag it for the degradation by
the proteasome. the released dna-binding subunits are then
translocated into the nucleus, bind their cognate dna and
induce transcription of numerous target genes, many of them
involved in the acute and acquired immune response [6]. the
repressive e¡ect of the gr on nf-ub-dependent gene expression is either explained by the gc-induced upregulation of
iub-k, or alternatively by the mutual interaction and inactivation of both transcription factors [7]. besides the obvious
uses of gcs for the treatment of adrenocortical insu¤ciencies
and as anti-in£ammatory drugs [8], their administration
causes thymic involution by inducing survival or apoptosis
of t-cells. this is physiologically relevant for shaping the
t-cell repertoire. however, the apoptosis-inducing property
is also clinically important, since gcs are frequent components of drug regimens used for the treatment of lymphomas
[9]. it is currently still controversial whether the apoptosisinducing properties of gcs rely on the repression of survival
genes or the induction of apoptosis genes [10,11].
in some cases, transactivation and transrepression can be
distinguished by the use of synthetic, so-called dissociating
ligands, allowing transactivation without transrepression and
vice versa [12]. such dissociating ligands have been found for
the  xxxd3417xxx  receptor and the gr [11]. this study is the
¢rst systematic comparison of a number of natural and synthetic steroids, revealing remarkable di¡erences in their ability
to trigger gre-dependent gene expression, to induce apoptosis and to transrepress nf-ub-dependent transcription. these
di¡erences hopefully contribute to the future development of
new therapeutic protocols, which allow the combination of
optimal therapeutic results with minimal side e¡ects.

10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 10 mm hepes and 1%
(v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (all from life technologies, grand island, ny, usa). murine l929sa ¢brosarcoma cells were grown in
dulbecco's modi¢ed eagle medium (dmem) supplemented with 10%
(v/v) fetal calf serum and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin. all cells
were grown in a humidi¢ed incubator at 37³c and 5% co2 . l929 cells
were transiently transfected with lipofectamine (gibco-brl, eggenstein, germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2.2. dna fragmentation assay
cem c7 cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with
phosphate-bu¡ered saline and lysed in 0.5u tbe (25 mm tris,
25 mm boric acid and 0.5 mm edta) containing 0.25% (v/v) np40 and 0.5 mg/ml rnase h. the samples were incubated for 45 min at
37³c and subsequently 0.5 mg/ml proteinase k (sigma, st. louis,
mo, usa) was added. after a further incubation for 45 min at
37³c, the cell debris was pelleted upon centrifugation with 14 000
rpm at 4³c for 10 min. the dna fragments contained in the supernatant were separated on a 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel in 1u tbe bu¡er
at 50 v for 3 h. the dna was stained with ethidium bromide and
analyzed under ultraviolet light.
2.3. detection of apoptosis by facs analysis
apoptosis was measured by determining the percentage of hypoploid cells after lysis in a hypotonic bu¡er containing 50 wg/ml  xxxd3027xxx  iodide, 0.1% (w/v) sodium citrate and 0.1% (v/v) triton x-100
(all from sigma, st. louis, mo, usa). fluorescence was measured in
a facscan and analyzed with cellquest software (becton dickinson, heidelberg, germany) as described earlier [13].
2.4. electrophoretic mobility shift assays (emsas)
murine l929sa cells were stimulated with 2000 units/ml recombinant tnf-k (boehringer mannheim, mannheim, germany) for the
indicated periods, washed twice with cold phosphate-bu¡ered saline
and scraped o¡ with a rubber policeman. after centrifugation for
3 min with 3000 rpm the total cellular proteins were extracted from
the pellet by lysis in totex bu¡er (20 mm hepes/koh, ph 7.9,
0.35 m nacl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) np-40, 1 mm mgcl2 ,
0.5 mm edta, 0.1 mm egta, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl £uoride). the tubes were incubated on ice for 30 min and vortexed every
10 min. equal amounts of protein contained in the supernatant were
tested for nf-ub dna binding activity as described [14].
2.5. western blot analysis and luciferase assays
for western blotting the proteins were separated by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a polyvinylidene
di£uoride membrane (millipore, bedford, ma, usa) using a semidry blot apparatus (biorad, muënchen, germany). the iub-k proteins
were detected using rabbit polyclonal antibodies and a horseradish
peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody essentially as described [14].
for the determination of luciferase activity, the cells were washed with
phosphate-bu¡ered saline and lysed in 100 wl of lysis bu¡er (tropix,
bedford, ma, usa). the luciferase assays were performed according
to the manufacturer's manual (promega, mannheim, germany) and
quanti¢ed in a duo lumat lb 9507 (berthold, wildbad, germany).

prednisolone and prednisolone acetate induced gene expression to an intermediate extent. full transcriptional activation
was reached by betamethasone, triamcinolone, dexamethasone and  xxxd1719xxx . the strongly transactivating gcs were
still active even when applied at 1037 m, the weakly transactivating gcs showed a strongly impaired transactivation at
this concentration. the gene-inductive e¡ects of all steroids
were almost completely lost in the presence of 1 wm ru486
(data not shown).
the therapeutic e¡ects of gcs in the treatment of leukemias and lymphomas are not fully understood and largely
empirical [9]. it is generally believed that most of the cytostatic e¡ects of gcs can be explained by their ability to induce
apoptosis in t-cell lymphomas [10]. therefore we systematically compared the apoptosis-inducing e¡ects of the various
steroids listed in fig. 1. the suitability of cem c7 t-cells as
a model system to study gc-induced apoptosis was characterized by analyzing the gc-induced dna fragmentation, a
characteristic feature of programmed cell death. cem c7 cells
were treated for 48 h with 1 wm of dexamethasone and the
genomic dna was analyzed on agarose gels (fig. 3a). dexamethasone induced the typical cleavage of dna into multimers of domain-sized fragments, thus ensuring that the cells
die from apoptosis rather than from necrosis. the various
hormones were added to exponentially growing cem c7
t-cells at di¡erent concentrations for two days. apoptosis
was measured in a facscan by the determination of hypoploid cells (fig. 3b). triamcinolone, dexamethasone, betamethasone,  xxxd1719xxx  and prednisolone acetate e¤ciently induced apoptosis at all concentrations to comparable extents.
prednisolone at a concentration of 1036 m was still apoptosisinducing, but the concentration of 1037 m killed only a fraction of the t-cells. hydrocortisone induced apoptosis only
very weakly. both sex steroids and ru486 did not display
any cytotoxic e¡ects. to address the question whether gcinduced apoptosis requires activation or repression of target
genes, we measured the e¡ects of the antagonist ru486 on
gc-induced apoptosis. the addition of ru486 e¤ciently repressed apoptosis induced by all glucocorticoids tested here

3. results and discussion
the structures of the various steroids used in this study are
displayed in fig. 1. the sex steroids  xxxd3327xxx 
and  xxxd2038xxx  are included as controls since they
have no signi¢cant a¤nity to the gr. ru486 acts as a gr
antagonist, all other steroids belong to the family of glucocorticoids. the gene-inductive e¡ects of the various hormones
displayed in fig. 1 were systematically compared. murine
l929 ¢brosarcoma cells were transiently transfected with a
luciferase reporter gene controlled by the mouse mammary
tumor virus (mmtv) long terminal repeat which contains
several gres. the analysis of gene expression induced by
the di¡erent concentrations of the various hormones revealed
no signi¢cant transactivation by ru486 and the two sex steroids (fig. 2). hydrocortisone, one of the endogenous gcs,

(black bars). luciferase activity contained in equal amounts of cell
extracts was determined. the mean of four separate experiments is
shown, standard deviations are indicated by bars.

(fig. 3b), thus highlighting the importance of gene-inductive
e¡ects for apoptosis. this idea is supported by the analysis of
mice expressing a dominant negative gr mutant (a458t)
that abolishes transactivation. thymocytes derived from these
animals are unable to undergo apoptosis induced by the synthetic steroid dexamethasone [15].
we next tested the repressive e¡ects of the various hormones on nf-ub-induced transcription. the in£uence of
gcs on tnf-k-stimulated nf-ub-dependent transcription
was measured in l929 cells stably transfected with an nfub-dependent luciferase reporter gene [16]. the tnf-k-induced nf-ub activation was signi¢cantly reduced by all
gcs (with the exception of both sex steroids) to a comparable
extent (fig. 4). transrepression of nf-ub was even seen for
the antagonist ru486 and the relatively weakly transactivating gcs hydrocortisone and prednisolone. taken together,
these ¢ndings show that: (i) all gcs tested here can repress
nf-ub transcription, suggesting that simply a ligand-induced

of dna into oligonucleosomes was determined by horizontal agarose gel electrophoresis followed by staining with ethidium bromide.

mean values from 4 independent experiments are shown, bars show
standard deviations.

l929 cells stably transfected with an nf-ub-controlled luciferase reporter gene were preincubated with 1036 m (grey bars) or 1037 m
(black bars) of the indicated gcs for 1 h. subsequently transcription was induced by the addition of tnf-k (2000 u/ml) for 10 h
and luciferase activity was determined. mean values from 3 independent experiments are displayed, bars represent standard deviations.

nuclear localization is su¤cient for transrepression; (ii) there
seems to be a correlation between the ability of gcs to induce
gre-dependent transcription and apoptosis. we speculate
that the individual transactivating capacity of each gc relies
on its ability to induce a speci¢c conformation that enables
the transcription activation, e.g. by allowing contacts to coactivators and/or components of the basal transcription machinery [2]. it is imaginable that each bound hormone will
allow the formation of an individual hydrogen-bonding network and individual amido-keto interactions with the ligand
binding domain of the gr, thus in£uencing its three-dimensional structure. along this line, binding of 17l-estradiol or of
the selective antagonist raloxifene induced distinct conformations in the transactivation domain within the ligand-binding
domain of the  xxxg730xxx  [17]. the same applies to the
 xxxg1737xxx , which adopted distinct conformations
depending on the binding of progesterone or ru486 [18].
the question whether or not gcs may induce the increased
production of the inhibitory iub-k molecule which then
would lead to the dissociation of nf-ub from its cognate
dna is still a matter of debate [7,19]. to address the question
whether these con£icting results may be attributed to di¡erent
stuctures of the gcs, we treated l929 cells with various gcs
and looked at the impact on tnf-k-induced dna binding of
nf-ub (fig. 5a). dna binding of nf-ub was not a¡ected by
any of the gcs tested here. the same extracts were assayed
for the relative levels of iub-k in western blot experiments
(fig. 5a). short-time treatment of cells with tnf-k resulted
in the induced degradation of iub-k, but the cells pretreated
with betamethasone, triamcinolone, prednisolone acetate,  xxxd1719xxx , hydrocortisone and dexamethasone showed elevated
levels of iub-k. this may be explained either by an induced
synthesis or by an impaired degradation of iub-k. in order to
distinguish between both possibilities, we exposed l929 cells
for 8 h to the various steroids and determined the iub-k
protein levels from unstimulated or tnf-k-stimulated cells
(fig. 5b). the unstimulated cells showed no signi¢cant increase in the levels of iub-k protein, excluding the induced
synthesis of iub-k as a possible mechanism. therefore it

fig. 5. impact of various gcs on dna binding of nf-ub and iub-k degradation. a: tnf-k (2000 u/ml) was added for 15 min to l929 cells
that were preincubated as shown for 1 h with 1 wm of the indicated gcs. total cell extracts were prepared and dna binding of activated
nf-ub was measured by emsa (upper). the ¢lled arrowhead indicates the location of the dna-nf-ub complex, the circle indicates the position of a constitutively dna-binding protein and the open arrowhead points to the unbound oligonucleotide. the same extracts were tested
for the iub-k protein in a western blot (lower). the arrow points to the iub-k protein. b: l929 cells were grown for 8 h in the presence of
1 wm of the various gcs, the indicated cells were subsequently treated for 15 min with tnf-k (2000 u/ml). equal amounts of total cellular
proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting for the occurrence of iub-k which was detected with a polyclonal k-iub-k antibody.

seems that the described upregulation of iub-k protein as seen
for instance in lymphoid cells [20,21] is restricted to certain
cell types, since many cell lines including mouse ¢broblast
l929 (this study), human ¢broblast 293, monkey cos, human
t-cell cem-c7 and endothelial tc10 and baec cells did not
show elevated iub-k protein levels after treatment with gcs
[22^25]. stimulation of cells with tnf-k resulted in a complete degradation of iub-k in the absence of any hormone or
in the presence of both sex steroids. all other gcs prevented
the degradation of iub-k to various extents (fig. 5b). however, the tnf-k-induced dna-binding activity of nf-ub
contained in the di¡erent extracts remained unchanged (data
not shown). the uncoupling between both iub-k upregulation
and dna binding of nf-ub is also evident from the analysis
of gc analogues that were still competent for iub-k synthesis
but were unable to repress nf-ub [12]. similarly, the dexamethasone-induced iub-k synthesis in human pulmonary epithelial cells did not cause a reduction of nf-ub dna-binding
activity [19]. therefore the elucidation of the possible consequences and the identi¢cation of the signaling steps responsible for the impaired iub-k degradation discovered here requires future studies.
4. conclusion
taken together, the nf-ub-repressing activities of the various steroid hormones tested do not rely on special structural
requirements. triamcinolone,  xxxd1719xxx , dexamethasone and
betamethasone are very e¡ective in the induction of transcription and apoptosis, suggesting a correlation between these two
activities. these gcs display a high structural similarity and
di¡er only in the modi¢cations of c atoms c16 and c17. in
accordance with the results presented here, a previous study
revealed higher antileukemic activities and a ¢ve to six times

higher cytotoxicity of dexamethasone, when directly compared to prednisolone [26]. therefore future studies should
investigate whether prednisolone, which is frequently contained in chemotherapeutic anti-cancer drug regimens [9],
can be replaced by gcs displaying a higher cytotoxicity.
