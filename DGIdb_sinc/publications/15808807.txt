aldosterone exerts cardiovascular effects by influencing
epithelial fluid and electrolyte excretion, and thus blood
volume and pressure. mineralocorticoid receptors (mr)
are found in epithelial and non-epithelial tissues (vessel
walls, heart, brain), with high affinity for aldosterone
and physiological glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone. mr blockade by spironolactone or  xxxd2010xxx 
favorably affects cardiovascular outcomes. in some situations (primary aldosteronism, experimental mineralocorticoid administration) activation of cardiovascular
mr reflects aldosterone levels inappropriate for salt
status. in others (heart failure, essential hypertension)
aldosterone and nac status are often normal pretreatment; cardiovascular mr may thus be activated by
normal glucocorticoid levels after tissue damage and
reactive oxygen species generation. therefore, although
unilateral adrenalectomy is preferred therapy for unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma or hyperplasia,
mr blockade may be useful in cardiovascular diseases
where aldosterone levels are normal.
introduction
for almost 50 years aldosterone has been considered an
important but unidimensional hormone, secreted in
response to nac deficiency or kc loading, and responsible
for nac retention and kc excretion at epithelia such as
distal tubule and distal colon. nac retention entails water
retention, so that inappropriately high aldosterone levels
result in increased blood volume and cardiac output, with
cardiac output normalized by reflex vasoconstriction,
producing hypertension. non-epithelial sites of physiological aldosterone action include the central nervous
system, where it increases salt appetite, and the vascular
wall, where it directly increases vascular contractility.
although much remains to be explored in terms of the
pathophysiology of aldosterone action, there is general
consensus on its importance for transepithelial fluid and
electrolyte homeostasis, for salt appetite, and – more
recently – for vascular contractility.
in terms of aldosterone there are two major unanswered
questions in the cardiovascular area. the first is whether
cardiac and/or vascular synthesis of aldosterone has local,
paracrine and autocrine, pathophysiological roles. the
possibility of such ectopic synthesis has proved enticing,
corresponding author: funder, j.w. (john.funder@phimr.monash.edu.au).

and produced scores of papers; the conceptual underpinnings of such a possibility, in terms of sequential
enzymatic reactions, have essentially been ignored; the
data, in terms of aldosterone production or extraction
across the heart, for example, are squarely conflicting [1,2];
and the most recent analyses of levels of enzyme
expression and immunoassayable aldosterone do not
favor the possibility of cardiac aldosterone synthesis
[e. davies et al. (2004) does aldosterone have a place in
our hearts? in international aldosterone conference,
june 14–15, new orleans usa, pp. 19–21] [3]. most
tellingly, the vascular and perivascular inflammatory
response to  xxxg99xxx  infusion and salt loading – both
reported to increase cardiovascular aldosterone synthesis
[4,5] – are completely prevented by adrenalectomy [6].
the second unanswered question is how inappropriate
aldosterone for salt status produces the clinical and
experimental cardiovascular pathology that it does. subjects on a very restricted nac intake – for example, in the
monsoonal season in the new guinea highlands – have a
salt intake 2–3% that of western societies, and aldosterone levels far in excess of the upper limit of ‘normal’, with
no rise in blood pressure or other stigmata of cardiovascular damage. by contrast, even ‘normal’ circulating
levels and a high salt intake can have cardiovascular
sequelae, possibly because aldosterone levels are not sufficiently suppressed. this reflects the predominant evolutionary drive to ensure nac retention and volume
replacement in the face of massive fluid and electrolyte
loss, from hemorrhage or more probably gastrointestinal
infection. in any event, it appears that aldosterone per se
is not a cardiovascular risk factor, but aldosterone in the
context of inappropriate salt status is. thus, the focus of
the current review is the efficacy of mineralocorticoid
receptor (mr) blockade in heart failure and essential
hypertension, where aldosterone levels are commonly
normal before treatment is instituted, and in the situation
of conn’s syndrome, where frank elevation of plasma
aldosterone is characteristic of the condition.
physiology, biochemistry and molecular biology
aldosterone acts by binding to the mr, first described in
classic nac-transporting epithelial tissues [7,8], and
subsequently in a range of non-epithelial sites, such as
cardiomyocytes [9] and blood vessels [10]. in epithelia,
blood vessels and certain circumscribed brain areas, mr

are ‘protected’ against activation by glucocorticoids –
which circulate at plasma concentrations w1000-fold
higher than those of aldosterone, and have comparable
affinity for mr – by coexpression of the enzyme 11b
hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11bhsd2), which converts
cortisol to receptor-inactive cortisone [11,12], and the
cosubstrate nad to nadh, as described elsewhere in this
issue [13]. in the renal distal tubule, aldosterone increases
nac transport by the induction of a range of proteins,
including nac/kc atpase subunits and sgk-1 [14]. in
other mr-expressing tissues, in addition to the kidney,
microarray studies are currently in progress in an attempt
to identify and weigh the changes in protein expression
responsible for the ion transport and other effects of
aldosterone acting via mr.
in epithelial tissues, there is no question that mr can
be activated by cortisol under certain conditions, most
particularly when the enzyme 11bhsd2 is either blocked
– after licorice overindulgence or  xxxd433xxx  administration – or congenitally deficient, in the syndrome of
apparent mineralocorticoid excess [15]. in normal circumstances, however, glucocorticoids appear to occupy both
epithelial and non-epithelial mr in tonic inhibitory mode
[16,17], not activating the receptor and excluding aldosterone. the mechanisms whereby this switch in antagonist–agonist activity is effected are currently the subject of
intense speculation. what is crucial to recognize is that in
most essential hypertensives, or patients in heart failure,
plasma aldosterone levels are within the normal range
until they receive diuretics: the case for aldosterone being
a driver under such conditions is at best tenuous, given
that its elevation represents an appropriate response to
nac loss. by contrast, there is no question that mr
activation is involved, as shown by the remarkable
outcomes of the rales (randomized  xxxd3238xxx  evaluation study) and ephesus ( xxxd2010xxx  post-acute
myocardial infarction heart failure efficacy and survival
study) trials [18,19]. thus, there are two important
questions. first, under what circumstances is aldosterone/
salt imbalance responsible for cardiovascular pathology as
a result of inappropriate mr activation? second, where
aldosterone levels are normal, what is the contribution of
mr activation to, for example, blood pressure elevation in
essential hypertension?
the answer to the first question is clearly the syndrome
of primary aldosteronism, discussed in some detail later in
this article, and in further detail elsewhere in this issue
[13]. in addition to primary aldosteronism, the incidence
of which is variously estimated to be 7–13% of essential
hypertensives, there exists a larger group of patients who
have autonomous aldosterone production, on the basis of
an abnormal aldosterone to renin ratio, but in whom
aldosterone levels are at or below the upper limit of
normal [20]: it is not unreasonable to infer that part of
their increased blood pressure might reflect subtle
abnormalities in aldosterone–sodium balance over
time, and that mr antagonist treatment might be
appropriate therapy, as it commonly appears to be in
resistant hypertensives with unsatisfactory lowering
of blood pressure on three or more other antihypertensive agents.

the answer to the second question might at least in
part be provided by a recent titration-to-effect study using
the selective mr antagonist  xxxd2010xxx  [21]. just over
40% of patients with essential hypertension reached goal
blood pressure (diastolic !90 mm hg) on 50 mg  xxxd1482xxx  for
four weeks; those who did not were up-tritrated to
100 mg  xxxd1482xxx  for another four weeks, with about a third
responding; the remaining 40% were then given
200 mg  xxxd1482xxx  for a third three-week period, with half
responding, and the other half (w21% of the total group)
showing a negligible blood pressure fall (2/1 mm hg). our
interpretation of these data is that mr activation –
central, vascular and tubular – varies perhaps over an
order of magnitude in an otherwise apparently homogeneous population of essential hypertensives. of interest
is that the tubular contribution appears to be less
significant, in that there was no difference in the modest
changes in plasma kc between responders and nonresponders at any dose level.
heart failure and hypertension
at the time when rales was designed, patients with
progressive heart failure were commonly treated with
 xxxg36xxx  (ace) inhibitors, diuretics
and a range of other medications that did not usually
include b-blockers. after prolonged ace inhibition
(and even combined ace inhibition and  xxxg99xxx 
receptor blockade), the initial fall in circulating aldosterone levels was often not maintained, and reverted to or
above normal levels. this has often been termed ‘aldosterone escape’, even though that phrase has been used for
at least four decades to describe renal escape from
continued hyperaldosteronemia. this clinical observation,
better termed ‘aldosterone breakthrough’, plus the early
experimental studies on cardiac fibrosis post-aldosterone
plus salt [22,23], were the driver for rales.
the trial thus represented a leap of faith, proof-ofprinciple with an out-of-patent drug ( xxxd3238xxx ) in an
expensive, multicenter international outcome trial.
rales was terminated just over halfway through the
recruitment period, reflecting the progressive divergence
between the two groups of new york heart association
class iii patients. one group (control) received standard of
care treatment plus placebo, the other plus spironolactone
(average dose, 26 mg  xxxd1482xxx ). at the end of three years, the
addition of spironolactone provided a 30% improvement in
mortality, and a 35% fall in hospitalization. spironolactonetreated patients consistently showed plasma [k c ]
w0.2 meq lk1 higher than controls, and a 10% (versus 1%)
incidence of gynecomastia, reflecting its well-known antiandrogenic action.
thus, rales provided the impetus for ephesus, the
second major trial of mr blockade in heart failure. in this
second trial, the mr-selective antagonist  xxxd2010xxx  was
used in patients with heart failure post-myocardial
infarction. again, two groups were compared – one on
standard of care (which now generally included b-blockers)
plus placebo, and the other plus  xxxd2010xxx  (average dose
43 mg  xxxd1482xxx ). at first sight, the improvement in mortality
and morbidity, 13–17% by various indices, appears less
than that in rales, a difference initially attributed to

b-blockade. however, when the ephesus patients with a
lower ejection fraction (equivalent to those in rales) are
considered, the beneficial effects of mr blockade (30–35%)
are identical in the two studies.
most recently, mr blockade by spironolactone has been
shown to improve indices of endothelial function in
otherwise optimally treated patients with mild heart
failure [24], with changes in a range of prognostic
markers, including vascular ace activity charted in
parallel. similarly, in a study on otherwise optimally
treated patients with diastolic heart failure, mr blockade
was shown to improve a variety of parameters of cardiac
performance [25], evidence for beneficial effects on
cardiomyocytes and the vessel wall.
there has been a series of clinical trials in hypertension, of which possibly the most illustrative is the socalled 4e trial, in which left ventricular hypertrophy
(lvh) was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, and
renal function by changes in urinary albumin excretion
[26,27]. in brief, patients were force titrated on  xxxd2010xxx 
(50, 100 or 200 mg  xxxd1482xxx ) or enalapril (10, 20 or 40 mg  xxxd1482xxx ),
both of which progressively reduce blood pressure, lvh
and proteinuria; of particular interest and clinical relevance was the demonstration that the combination of
 xxxd2010xxx  (200 mg  xxxd1482xxx ) and enalapril (10 mg  xxxd1482xxx ) was
clearly superior to the highest dose of either agent used
alone. although in some models of experimental hypertension (e.g.  xxxg99xxx  infusion plus salt loading) mr
blockade does not affect blood pressure but blocks the endorgan effects [6], the 4e studies suggest that in human
essential hypertension both angiotensin and aldosterone
have end-organ effects, which might be additive and thus
optimally blocked by combination therapy.
in both ephesus and the 4e studies, spot plasma
[kc] rose to r5.5 meq lk1 in a small (w5%) number of
patients on both ace inhibitor and mr antagonist. many
of these values represent a random technical error,
presumably a delay at room or body temperature between
venesection and analysis, because hyperkalemia could
usually not be confirmed by repeat examination. conversely, there is no question that kc retention is a major
effect of mr blockade, and that in patients with a low body
mass, low creatinine clearance or compromised renal
function, considerable care must be taken to avoid possible
hyperkalemia – particularly by avoiding supplemental
kc, reported to be coprescribed with spironolactone in a
recent heart failure series [28]. in hypertensive patients
with normal renal function, it has been shown that
hyperkalemia can be kept within bounds (average
increase %0.2 meq lk1) if  xxxd2010xxx  is relatively slowly
titrated to effect (diastolic blood pressure !90 mm hg),
rather than force titrated [21].
epidemiology and endpoints
there are few epidemiological data on an association
between aldosterone and cardiovascular disease; to the
best of our knowledge, no study has been specifically
designed as a prospective assessment of an association
between aldosterone levels and cardiovascular outcomes.
when aldosterone levels are physiologically raised, in
response to nac deficiency, there is no experimental or

clinical evidence for adverse cardiovascular outcomes;
when levels are inappropriate for salt status, as can often
be the case in the context of a high (150–250 meq  xxxd1482xxx ) salt
intake, deleterious consequences of the combination might
be seen. for example, a retrospective analysis of 1688
initially non-hypertensive participants in the framingham
offspring study recently documented a modest (16–17%)
increase in the risk of blood pressure elevation and the
development of hypertension across four quartiles stratified by initial aldosterone [29].
one interpretation of these findings is that the higher
the level of aldosterone within the ‘normal’ range the more
likely it is that hypertension will develop; however [30],
there are no data for the group on the major determinants
of aldosterone secretion (nac intake, plasma [kc],
plasma renin or  xxxg99xxx  levels), because only spot
urine samples were available. under such conditions, it is
not possible to determine whether plasma aldosterone
levels were inappropriate, or whether some subjects might
have a raised aldosterone:renin ratio, suggesting autonomous aldosterone secretion. this last option is a distinct
possibility, given the recent finding of a 32% incidence of
autonomous aldosterone secretion, with plasma aldosterone
levels largely in the ‘normal’ range, in an unselected
general practice population of mild hypertensives [20].
a recent comprehensive study from italy has shown the
incidence of established primary aldosteronism to be 7%,
in a prospective trial carried out nationwide on consecutive newly diagnosed hypertensive patients [31]. in this
primary aldosteronism prevalence in italy study, there is
evidence for a rate of cardiovascular injury and complications in excess of what might be predicted on the basis of
the extent of blood pressure elevation, in clear contrast to
the previous widely held assumption that primary
aldosteronism is a relatively benign form of hypertension.
in patients with primary aldosteronism, a variety of
endpoints in terms of cardiovascular damage has been
well documented. these include microalbuminuria [32],
endothelial dysfunction [33], structural changes in resistance vessels and large arteries [32–36], aortic dissection
[37], accelerated lvh [38–40], prolongation of the pq
interval and impaired diastolic function [41], and alterations in the densitometric properties [42] and ultrasound
backscatter indices [43] of the left ventricular (lv) wall.
all of these lv alterations are consistent with the
production of cardiac fibrosis in humans [42], which is in
turn consistent with animal experimental data [22,23].
most of these adverse consequences can thus be attributed, at least initially, to aldosterone-induced activation of
vascular mr, and the enhanced generation of reactive
oxygen species, which might serve to establish a vicious
cycle of mr activation by glucocorticoids [44].
further evidence for a dominant role for aldosterone in
the end-organ damage seen in primary aldosteronism
comes from studies comparing adrenalectomy and spironolactone administration in patients with a unilateral
aldosterone-producing adenoma [41]. in patients treated
by adrenalectomy, both lv mass and lv filling were
normalized as assessed by transmitral doppler flow
velocity measurement a year postoperatively. by contrast,
patients who represented a poor surgical risk, or who

refused adrenalectomy, and who were treated for a year
with spironolactone, showed no comparable lvh regression or normalization of lv filling. although this was not a
double-blind randomized study, and the patient selection
might serve to discount the potentially beneficial effects of
spironolactone therapy, it underlines the fact that the
effective treatment of choice in adrenal-producing adenoma is unilateral adrenalectomy.
conclusion
mr blockade appears to be of considerable therapeutic
value in essential hypertension and heart failure, but
clearly inferior to surgery for adrenal adenoma. the efficacy of mr antagonists in the context of normal aldosterone
levels and unremarkable nac status reflects their ability
to block the deleterious effects of receptor activation by
whatever ligand, suggesting potential roles for mr
antagonists for tissue protection in clinical situations not
characterized by aldosterone/salt imbalance.
