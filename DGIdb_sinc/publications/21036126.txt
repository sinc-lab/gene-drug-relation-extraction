 xxxd2314xxx , a mixed phosphodiesterase (pde) 3/4 inhibitor, is a cerebral vasodilator widely used in japan for
treating post-stroke dizziness. however, little studies have been conducted on the vasorelaxant effects of pde
inhibitors in the vertebrobasilar artery associated with dizziness onset. the in vitro vasorelaxant properties of
 xxxd2314xxx  were, therefore, investigated by comparing with known selective pde inhibitors, using
vertebrobasilar arteries. vasorelaxant activities of  xxxg1695xxx , pde4, pde5 inhibitors, and  xxxd2314xxx  were assessed
in 5-hydroxytryptamine precontracted ring preparations from rabbit intracranial and extracranial
vertebrobasilar arteries.  xxxd2314xxx  more selectively relaxed the intracranial than extracranial artery. similarly,
selective  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4 inhibitors showed higher selectivity for intracranial arteries. furthermore, like
selective pde4 inhibitor, the vasorelaxation by  xxxd2314xxx  accompanied by increase in camp levels was
inhibited by the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor sq22536 in intracranial arteries. next, it was examined whether
 xxxd2738xxx  (no)/cgmp signaling is involved in this vasorelaxation in intracranial arteries. the suppression of
no/cgmp signaling by an no synthase inhibitor or a  xxxg1587xxx  inhibitor potentiated the vasorelaxion
by a  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor and reduced that by a pde4 inhibitor, while either suppression of the signaling had little
inﬂuence on that by  xxxd2314xxx . these results suggest that  xxxd2314xxx  has the high vasoselectivity for intracranial
artery based on a mixed  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4-inhibition, and effectively relaxes intracranial arteries independently
of no/cgmp signaling because of its vasorelaxation compensated by either  xxxg1695xxx - or pde4-inhibition
depending on the state of no/cgmp signaling change.

1. introduction
cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (pdes) play key roles in
various physiological processes by hydrolyzing cyclic adenosine-3′,5′monophosphate (camp) and cyclic guanosine-3′,5′-monophosphate
(cgmp). the pde superfamily is divided into 11 gene families (pde1
to pde11), and each family has distinct tissue and cell expression
patterns (lugnier, 2006). cerebral vascular smooth muscles primarily
contain pde1,  xxxg1695xxx , pde4, and pde5 isozymes (lugnier, 2006).
previous studies have shown that  xxxg1695xxx , pde4, and pde5 isozymes are
mainly involved in the tonus control of basilar arteries in various
animals, such as guinea pig, rabbit, and canine (willette et al., 1997;
birk et al., 2004; kruuse et al., 2005).
in the peripheral artery such as the rat aorta and renal artery, some
studies have reported that the  xxxg1695xxx - and pde4-mediated camp
signaling pathway interacts with the cgmp signaling pathway
coupled with endothelium-derived  xxxd2738xxx  (no) (i.e., no/cgmp
signaling) in regulating the vascular tone, and these interactions have

been postulated to be based on the enzymatic properties of both pde
isozymes;  xxxg1695xxx  is directly inhibited by cgmp, and pde4 is indirectly
affected by no–cgmp signaling depending on the  xxxg1695xxx  activity
because the km value of pde4 for camp hydrolysis is higher than that
of  xxxg1695xxx  (lugnier et al., 1999; sandner et al., 1999; maurice, 2005). in
cerebral arteries, no obvious evidence has been found on the
interaction between these two pathways. only birk et al. (2004)
reported the endothelium-independent vasorelaxant effect of  xxxg1695xxx 
inhibitor in guinea pig basilar arteries. as for pde4, the vasorelaxation
produced by a pde4 inhibitor was endothelium-dependent in guinea
pig basilar arteries (birk et al., 2004), but not in canine basilar arteries
(willette et al., 1997). however, pelligrino and wang (1998) proposed that the interaction between camp and no/cgmp signaling
would occur in the cerebral vasorelaxation, because enzymatic
properties of  xxxg1695xxx  isozyme are not different between peripheral
and cerebral arteries.
 xxxd2314xxx  (3-isobutyryl-2-isopropylpyrazolo[1,5-a]-pyridine:
fig. 1) is a cerebral vasodilator, and widely used in japan for treating
post-stroke dizziness (kishi et al., 2001).indeed, previous studies have
reported that  xxxd2314xxx  potently relaxes or dilates canine basilar
arteries, human middle cerebral arteries, and cerebral pial arterioles
in newborn pigs (ohashi et al., 1986; onoue et al., 1992; armstead
et al., 1988).  xxxd2314xxx -mediated vasodilation was originally attributed

to nonselective inhibition of pde isozymes (kishi et al., 2001);
however, gibson et al. (2006) recently showed that  xxxd2314xxx 
preferentially inhibits recombinant human  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4. we,
therefore, examined the vasorelaxant proﬁles of  xxxd2314xxx , a mixed
 xxxg1695xxx /4 inhibitor, by investigating how  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4 isozymes
regulate the vascular tone and interact with no–cgmp signaling in the
vertebrobasilar artery whose embolic or atherosclerotic stenosis has
been reported to cause various symptoms including dizziness, vertigo
and so on (savitz and caplan, 2005).
2. materials and methods
2.1. isolation of vascular tissue
male japanese white rabbits (japan laboratory animals, tokyo,
japan), weighing 2.4–3.1 kg, were housed in a room maintained
under controlled conditions of temperature, 23 ± 3 °c, relative humidity
55± 15% and 12–12 h light–dark cycle. the rabbits were maintained on
a solid diet of 100–150 g daily with water ad libitum. the protocols and
animal care complied with the guiding principles for the care and use of
laboratory animals recommended by the japanese pharmacological
society, and followed the standard operating procedures for institutional animal care management in our facility.
animals were sacriﬁced by exsanguination under pentobarbital
sodium anesthesia (30 mg/kg, i.v.), and femoral artery and three
different sites of vertebrobasilar arteries – intracranial (basilar and
intracranial vertebral) and extracranial (extracranial vertebral) segments – were isolated for each experiment.
2.2. vasorelaxation measurement
for measuring vasorelaxation, the isolated arteries were cut into
rings of 3 mm (basilar and femoral arteries) or 2 mm (vertebral
arteries) in length in ice-cold krebs–henseleit solution (khs) of the
following composition (mm): nacl 118.2, kcl 4.6, cacl2·2h2o 1.6,
kh2po4 1.2,  xxxd2534xxx ·7h2o 1.2, glucose 10, nahco3 25, and gassed with
95% o2/5% co2, ph 7.4. one or 2 rings (vertebral or femoral arteries) or
1–4 rings (basilar arteries) were prepared from the same rabbits. each
ring preparation was mounted in an organ bath ﬁlled with 10-ml khs,
gassed with 95% o2/5% co2, and maintained at 37 °c using stainless
wires 120 and 245 mum in diameter for vertebrobasilar arteries and
femoral arteries, respectively. an initial tension of 300, 400, 400, and
800 mg was applied to the intracranial vertebral, basilar, extracranial
vertebral, and femoral arteries, respectively, to record the isometric
tensions. after equilibration, the contractile capacity of each arterial
segment was assessed following exposure to 60 mm kcl. cumulative
concentration–response curves of the test drugs were constructed to
evaluate vasorelaxant activity in arteries precontracted with submaximal concentrations (0.3 mum) of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht). this 5ht concentration was shown to elicit 70–90% of its maximum contraction in preliminary experiments, and similar results have been
reported in rabbit and canine basilar arteries (nakagomi et al., 1988).
the presence of functional endothelium was conﬁrmed by determin-

ing the ability of acetylcholine (1 mum) to induce relaxation of the rings
precontracted with 5-ht (0.3 mum) in preliminary experiments.
to examine the involvement of the camp signaling, adenylyl
cyclase  xxxd1116xxx -(tetrahydro-2′-furyl)adenine (sq22536, 100 mum)
was added 30 min before treatment with each test drug following the
5-ht challenge. to examine the involvement of no/cgmp signaling,
the nos inhibitor ng-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-name)
hydrochloride (100 mum) or the  xxxg1587xxx  inhibitor 1h-[1,2,4]
oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (odq, 10 mum) was added 30 min
before the 5-ht challenge.
the vasorelaxant responses to the test drugs are expressed as a
percentage of the tonic contraction induced by 5-ht. when the ring
preparations were pre-treated with l-name or odq, the 5-htinduced tonic contraction was to be normalized by subtracting the lname- or odq-induced contraction from the tonic contraction after
5-ht challenge, because l-name or odq alone affected the vascular
tone. the ec50 value of each drug was calculated from each of the
concentration–response curves by ﬁtting a logistic non-linear model,
using graghpad prism version 3.0 (graphpad software, san diego, ca,
usa). all the drug potencies are expressed as pec50, the negative
logarithm of the ec50.
the ﬁnal concentration of dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) in the assay
medium did not exceed 0.14%. in preliminary examinations, this
concentration of dmso was conﬁrmed to have no inﬂuence on the 5ht-induced contractile response.
2.3. pde assay
for the pde assay, the isolated vertebrobasilar arteries were cut
into small pieces, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at
−80 °c until use. the vascular tissue was homogenized using a
hiscotoron ns-50 (nichion, chiba, japan) in 10 vol (w/v) of
homogenizing buffer containing 20 mm tris–hcl [ph 7.4], 1 mm
dithiothreitol, 0.1% triton x-100, and complete mini edta-free
(protease inhibitor cocktail tablet). the homogenate was centrifuged
ﬁrst at 5000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was then centrifuged at
100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °c. the ﬁnal supernatant was used for the
pde assay as a crude enzyme preparation and kept at 4 °c during all
procedures.
the pde assay was performed according to a modiﬁcation of a
previously described two-step radioisotopic procedure (thompson
and appleman, 1971; wright et al., 1998). in brief, the pde assay was
conducted in 0.1 ml of a buffer comprising the following: 40 mm
tris–hcl [ph 8.0], 5 mm mgcl2·6h2o, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm
egta, 0.1 mg/ml bsa, 1 mum of either [2,8-3h]adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic
phosphate ammonium salt ([3h]camp) or [8-3h]guanosine 3′,5′cyclic phosphate ammonium salt ([3h]cgmp), 10-mul crude enzyme
and 10-mul test substance. the reaction was initiated by adding either
10-mul [3h]camp (approximately 110,000 dpm) or 10-mul [3h]cgmp
(approximately 40,000 dpm), and following incubation at 30 °c for
30 min, the reaction was terminated by boiling the assay mixture for
2.5 min. then, the reaction mixture was cooled on ice, and after 40 mul
of crotalus atrox snake venom (1 mg/ml) was added, the mixture
was incubated at 30 °c for 10 min. the reaction was stopped by
adding 1 ml of dowex ag 1-x8 anion exchanger-methanol–water
(1:2:1) solution. the preparation was vortexed and then allowed to
stand for 10 min at 4 °c before centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min
at 4 °c. radioactivity in 600 mul of the supernatant was quantiﬁed in
9 ml of aqueous counting scintillant (acs ii). data represent
percentage inhibition of hydrolysis compared to control hydrolysis.
the ﬁnal concentration of dmso in the assay medium did not exceed
0.2% (saeki and saito, 1993). the maximum concentrations of the
selective pde inhibitors in our study were selected on the basis of
each of the inhibitory constants reported for the respective pde
isozymes (at least 50-fold higher concentration of each reported
constant, lugnier and komas, 1993; daugan et al., 2003).

2.4. cyclic nucleotide measurement
the isolated basilar and intracranial vertebral arteries from each of
eight rabbits were cut into segments of 2 mm in length in ice-cold khs
with the same composition as the tissue bath for measuring
vasorelaxation. the segments were equilibrated in 37 °c khs, gassed
with 95% o2/5% co2 for over 60 min, and treated with the test drug or
its vehicle for 30 min. then, the samples were immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at below − 30 °c until nucleotide
measurement. the frozen tissues were homogenized in ice-cold 5%
trichloroacetic acid (tca) using an ultrasonic oscillator and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °c. the supernatant was washed
using water-saturated ether to remove the tca. the camp concentration was measured using a commercially available enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (cayman chemical company, ann arbor, mi,
usa). total protein was determined using a coomassie plus protein
assay kit (pierce biotechnology, rockford, il, usa). the amount of
camp in each vascular tissue was standardized to pmol  xxxd1773xxx /mg
protein.
2.5. drugs and reagents
 xxxd2314xxx  was synthesized at nippon rika co. (tokyo, japan). 5-ht
creatinine sulphate complex was obtained from sigma-aldrich co. (st
louis, mo, usa).  xxxd1698xxx  and cilostamide were purchased from
biomol international l.p. (plymouth meeting, pa, usa).  xxxd3142xxx ,
zaprinast, 2-butyl-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-5,6,11,11a-tetrahydro-1himidazo[1′,5′:1,6] xxxd3047xxx [3,4-b]indole-1,3(2h)-dione (pde v inhibitor ii), odq, sq 22536, and l-name hydrochloride were obtained

vasorelaxant effects were assessed using arteries precontracted with a submaximal
concentration of 5-ht (0.3 mum). each mark and bar represents the mean ± s.e.m. of 6
experiments.

3.2. the vasorelaxant selectivity of known selective pde inhibitors in
vertebrobasilar arteries
to determine which pde isozymes contribute signiﬁcantly to the
high selectivity of  xxxd2314xxx  for intracranial arteries, we examined the
vasorelaxant potential of known  xxxg1695xxx  ( xxxd1698xxx  and cilostamide),
pde4 ( xxxd3142xxx  and ro 20–1724), and pde5 (zaprinast and pde v
inhibitor ii) inhibitors using basilar, intracranial vertebral, and
extracranial vertebral arteries. table 1 summarizes the drug potencies
(pec50) and the published inhibitory activities (pic50 values; the
negative logarithm of the ic50) of each pde inhibitor against the
corresponding pde isozymes (torphy and cieslinski, 1990; lugnier
and komas, 1993; sudo et al., 2000; daugan et al., 2003; gibson et al.,
2006). both  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4 inhibitors similarly relaxed the basilar
and intracranial vertebral arteries but more potently these intracranial arteries than the extracranial vertebral artery (table 1). the
relative selectivities of the  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4 inhibitors were 10 times
and 80–400 times greater, respectively, for the intracranial artery than
for the extracranial vertebral artery (table 1). in contrast, pde5
inhibitors were nonselective for any arterial site: for example, the
pec50 of phosphodiesterase v inhibitor ii in the basilar and extracranial vertebral arteries was 5.3 and 5.1, respectively (table 1). the

3.1. the vasorelaxant selectivity of  xxxd2314xxx  in vertebrobasilar arteries
 xxxd2314xxx  (0.001–30 mum) relaxed 5-ht-induced contractions of the
basilar, intracranial vertebral and extracranial vertebral arteries in a
concentration-dependent manner (fig. 2). the vasorelaxant potency
of  xxxd2314xxx  was the same in the basilar (pec50 = 6.6 ± 0.1) and
intracranial vertebral arteries (pec50 = 6.7 ± 0.1) (table 1).  xxxd2314xxx 
relaxed the intracranial arteries 40 or 50 times more selectively and
potently than the extracranial vertebral artery (pec50 = 5.0 ± 0.1,
p b 0.01 vs. each of basilar and intracranial vertebral arteries)
(table 1); the relaxant response of the extracranial vertebral artery
to  xxxd2314xxx  was almost equal to that of the femoral artery (pec50 =
4.8 ± 0.1), a typical peripheral artery.

vasorelaxant selectivity of  xxxd2314xxx , a mixed  xxxg1695xxx /4 inhibitor, for the
intracranial artery was similar to that of each selective  xxxg1695xxx  or pde4
inhibitor (table 1).
3.3. relative activity of pde isozymes to cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis in
intracranial and extracranial arteries
we examined whether the relative activity of pde isozymes is
different between intracranial and extracranial arteries by measuring
the maximum abilities of selective pde inhibitors to inhibit cyclic
nucleotide hydrolysis.  xxxd1698xxx  ( xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor) maximally inhibited
total camp hydrolysis by approximately 60% in both the basilar and
intracranial vertebral arteries, whereas by approximately 40% in
extracranial vertebral artery (table 2).  xxxd3142xxx  (pde4 inhibitor)
suppressed camp hydrolysis with a maximum of approximately 35%,
regardless of artery site (table 2). simultaneous treatment with  xxxg1695xxx 
and pde4 inhibitors resulted in additive inhibition of approximately
90% in intracranial artery and 70% in extracranial artery (table 2).
these results were similar to the inhibition by 100 mum  xxxd2314xxx  alone
(table 2). the pde v inhibitor ii (pde5 inhibitor) suppressed cgmp
hydrolysis with a maximum of approximately 70–80%, regardless of
artery site (table 2).
3.4. involvement of camp signaling in  xxxd2314xxx -induced vasorelaxation
of intracranial arteries
to determine the involvement of camp-degrading pde (such as
 xxxg1695xxx  and pde4) in  xxxd2314xxx -induced vasorelaxation of intracranial
arteries, the inﬂuences of an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor (sq22536) on
the vasorelaxation and changes in intracellular camp were examined.
the 5-ht-induced contraction was not affected so much by the
sq22536 treatment (contractile force, 204.1 ± 18.3 vs. 200.4 ±
20.2 mg in basilar artery, n = 10; and 194.1 ± 19.7 vs. 169.4 ±
10.5 mg in intracranial vertebral artery, n = 10). in the basilar arteries,
the concentration–response curve to  xxxd2314xxx  (pec50 = 6.5 ± 0.3) was
signiﬁcantly shifted to the right by pretreatment with sq22536
(100 mum) (pec50 = 5.0 ± 0.3, p b 0.01), as this is the case for the curve
to  xxxd3142xxx  (pec50, 7.1 ± 0.1 vs. 4.8 ± 0.4, p b 0.01) (fig. 3, table 3).
similar results were observed in the intracranial vertebral artery
(table 3). furthermore, as with  xxxd3142xxx  (10 mum), basilar artery
samples treated with  xxxd2314xxx  (0.1–10 mum) caused a concentration-

3.5. inﬂuences of no/cgmp signaling on the vasorelaxant effects of pde
inhibitors in intracranial arteries
in the basilar artery, the 5-ht-induced contraction was signiﬁcantly enhanced by the no synthase inhibitor l-name (contractile
force, 195.3 ± 13.9 vs. 321.6 ± 22.9 mg; p b 0.01, n = 15), or by
 xxxg1587xxx  inhibitor odq (contractile force, 205.1 ± 14.6 vs.
358.3 ± 31.8 mg; p b 0.01, n = 15). similarly, the 5-ht-induced contraction of the intracranial vertebral artery was signiﬁcantly enhanced
by odq (contractile force, 185.3 ± 16.9 vs. 299.3 ± 35.3 mg; respectively. p b 0.01, n = 15). these observations imply that endogenous
no/cgmp pathway regulates vasorelaxation in the intracranial
arteries.
therefore, to examine any possible interaction of  xxxg1695xxx - and pde4mediated camp signaling with endogenous no/cgmp signaling in the
intracranial artery, we evaluated whether changes in no/cgmp
signaling affect the vasorelaxation by the  xxxg1695xxx , pde4 inhibitor and
 xxxd2314xxx  in the presence or absence of odq and l-name. only the
odq treatment was examined in the intracranial vertebral artery,
because the vasorelaxant activities of the selective  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4
inhibitors used were similar both in intracranial vertebral artery and
in basilar artery (table 1). the concentration–response curve to
 xxxd1698xxx  was signiﬁcantly enhanced by odq (10 mum) in basilar artery
(pec50, 6.0 ± 0.2 vs. 7.0 ± 0.2, p b 0.01) and in intracranial vertebral
artery (pec50, 6.1 ± 0.0 vs. 7.1 ± 0.2, p b 0.01) (table 4, fig. 5). on

4. discussion
this study demonstrates two novel vasorelaxant proﬁles of
 xxxd2314xxx , a mixed  xxxg1695xxx /4 inhibitor. first, the higher vasoselectivity
of  xxxd2314xxx  for the intracranial than the extracranial vertebrobasilar
artery probably results from  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4-inhibition. second,
 xxxd2314xxx  relaxes the intracranial artery in a no/cgmp-independent
manner, which is considered based on the compensation by either
 xxxg1695xxx - or pde4-inhibition depending on the state of no/cgmp signaling change.

vasorelaxant effects were assessed using arteries precontracted with a submaximal
concentration of 5-ht (0.3 mum). each mark and bar represents the mean ± s.e.m. of 5
experiments.

 xxxd2314xxx  was highly potent and selective in vasorelaxation for the
intracranial artery (i.e., the basilar and intracranial vertebral artery),
similarly to selective  xxxg1695xxx  or pde4 inhibitors alone but not selective
pde5 inhibitors. in addition, the vasorelaxing potency (pec50) of
 xxxd2314xxx  for the intracranial artery is similar to or somewhat higher
than its inhibitory constant (pic50) against  xxxg1695xxx  or pde4 isozymes
(table 1). and selective  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4 inhibitors alone also showed
proﬁles similar to  xxxd2314xxx  in terms of pec50 and pic50 values
(table 1). the above pec50 values of  xxxd2314xxx  (ec50 = 0.25–0.31 mum)
are close to clinical plasma levels of this drug (25 ng/ml: approximately 0.1 mum) (kishi et al., 2001). furthermore,  xxxd2314xxx -induced
vasorelaxation of the intracranial arteries is camp-dependent,
because the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor sq22536 inhibited the
vasorelaxation by  xxxd2314xxx  (table 3) and also because  xxxd2314xxx 
increased camp levels in a concentration range in which the drug
relaxes the intracranial arteries (fig. 4). thus, these indicate that the
high selectivity of  xxxd2314xxx  for the intracranial artery is probably

610

attributed to  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4-inhibition. to our knowledge, this is the
ﬁrst report to show that  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4-inhibition play a role in
vasoselectivity for intracranial artery. our results are further supported by the previous reports that the  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4 isozymes
participate in the tonus control of the intracranial artery in guinea pig
and canine basilar arteries (willette et al., 1997; birk et al., 2004).
on the other hand, it was unclear in the present study which pde
isozyme(s) contribute to relax the extracranial artery, because all
selective  xxxg1695xxx , pde4 and pde5 inhibitors used had an equally and
relatively weak vasorelaxant activity in this artery. thus, some other
pde isozyme(s) may participate in vasorelaxation of extracranial
artery.
we examined whether the vasoselectivity can be explained by the
differences in relative activity of pde isozymes between intracranial
and extracranial arteries.  xxxd3142xxx  (a pde4 inhibitor) relaxed much
more selectively the intracranial than extracranial artery (table 1) but
almost evenly inhibited pde4 activity among arteries (table 2). thus,
the high intracranial selectivity of pde4 inhibitor is suggested not to
be accounted for by the relative pde activity. on the other hand, as for
 xxxg1695xxx  isozyme, the relative camp-pde activity in intracranial artery
was higher than that in extracranial artery. and  xxxd1698xxx  ( xxxg1695xxx 
inhibitor) relaxed the intracranial and extracranial artery in parallel
with their relative  xxxg1695xxx  inhibition (tables 1 and 2). therefore, the
difference in relative  xxxg1695xxx  activity between arteries may confer the
high selectivity of  xxxd1698xxx  for intracranial artery. however, whether
the vasoselectivity of  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor is fully accounted for by this
difference is still not clear, because the difference in relative activity is
only approx. 20% (table 2). one possibility behind the ﬁnding that
vasoselectivity was not in parallel with relative pde activity is that
there may be the presence of a functional compartmentalization of
camp signaling in vasorelaxation (pelligrino and wang, 1998; bartsch
et al., 2004). as an additional experiment, we thought to try to assess
that by using real-time quantitative pcr in order to examine whether
the expression of pde isozymes is different between intracranial and
extracranial artery. however, such efforts were forced to abandon,
because of non-speciﬁcity of several primers and probes that were
designed based on the amino acid sequences conserved among mouse
and human.
certain pharmacological effects of  xxxd2314xxx  have been reported to
be associated with cgmp signaling or camp signaling pathway depending on the action. for example, the protecting effect of  xxxd2314xxx 
against h2o2-induced injury in cultured rat astrocyte was accompanied with an increase in intracellular cgmp levels (takuma et al.,
2001). furthermore, the relaxation of bovine tracheal smooth muscle
by  xxxd2314xxx  was based on an increase in cgmp levels mediated by
pde5 inhibition (nakahara et al., 2002). despite these previous
studies, the increase in intracellular cgmp levels by pde5-inhibition in
the present study is considered involved not so much, if any, in the
 xxxd2314xxx -induced vasorelaxation in the intracranial arteries, because
selective pde5 inhibitors produced only weak vasorelaxation in those
arteries (table 1) and the inhibitory constant of  xxxd2314xxx  against pde5
isozyme (ic50 = 51.6 mum: gibson et al., 2006) was approximately 100fold higher than its ec50 values (0.25–0.31 mum) in vasorelaxation
(table 1). the present study, however, cannot deny that some other
cgmp-hydrolysing pde isozymes than pde5 contribute to the
vasorelaxation by  xxxd2314xxx . much higher concentrations (at least
above 10 mum) of  xxxd2314xxx  were used in the previous studies saying
that cgmp signaling is involved in the mechanism of action of
 xxxd2314xxx  (takuma et al., 2001; nakahara et al., 2002). taken together,
therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that the potent, selective
intracranial vasorelaxation by  xxxd2314xxx  results largely from the
increased intracellular camp levels mediated by the  xxxg1695xxx  and
pde4-inhibition.
although pelligrino and wang (1998) have proposed that the
interaction between camp and no/cgmp signaling occur in the
cerebral vasorelaxation because enzymatic properties of  xxxg1695xxx 

isozyme are not different between peripheral and cerebral arteries,
little evidence has been reported about such interaction in cerebral
vasorelaxation. we, therefore, examined whether no/cgmp signaling
is involved in the vasorelaxation by  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4 inhibitors of
intracranial arteries. the suppression of no/cgmp signaling by lname or odq potentiated the vasorelaxing activity of a  xxxg1695xxx 
inhibitor. to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report to show the
interaction between  xxxg1695xxx -mediated camp signaling and no/cgmp
signaling in the cerebral vasorelaxation, one possible explanation for
this is as follows:  xxxg1695xxx  activity is somewhat inhibited by endogenous
cgmp under normal conditions, while disinhibition of  xxxg1695xxx  occurs
under suppressed no/cgmp signaling conditions by treatment of lname or odq, thereby potentiating the vasorelaxing activity of the
 xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor. however, there is a study reporting a different ﬁnding
that odq treatment, as well as endothelium denudation, had no
inﬂuence on the vasorelaxation caused by a  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor in guinea
pig basilar arteries (birk et al., 2004). the reason for the discrepancy
between our data and that from guinea pigs is unknown. nevertheless,  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors were also much less effective at relaxing the
intracranial artery than pde4 inhibitors in the study by birk et al.
(2004), as observed in our study. the authors of the guinea pig study
did not explain why such a difference in effectiveness exists.
contrary to a selective  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor, the vasorelaxation by
 xxxd3142xxx , a selective pde4 inhibitor, was signiﬁcantly attenuated by

fig. 6. schematic presentation of the proposed major vasorelaxant mechanism of
 xxxd2314xxx  in the intracranial vertebrobasilar artery. under normal conditions of no/
cgmp signaling (a), pde4 (high km for camp) is allowed to degrade camp because
 xxxg1695xxx  (low km for camp) is inhibited by endogenous endothelium-dependent cgmp. a
pde4 inhibitor ( xxxd3142xxx ) therefore more effectively causes vasorelaxation than does a
 xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor ( xxxd1698xxx ). when no/cgmp signaling is suppressed (b), vasorelaxation
produced by a  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitor ( xxxd1698xxx ) is potentiated by the disinhibition of  xxxg1695xxx 
activity. the effectiveness of a pde4 inhibitor ( xxxd3142xxx ), in contrast, decreases because
the disinhibition of  xxxg1695xxx  activity reduces intracellular camp. vasorelaxation produced
by a mixed  xxxg1695xxx /4 inhibitor ( xxxd2314xxx ) consequently seems independent of no/cgmp
signaling.

t. yamazaki et al. / european journal of pharmacology 650 (2011) 605–611

the inhibition of no/cgmp signaling by either of l-name and odq,
and this ﬁnding is consistent with the previous study using guinea pig
basilar arteries (birk et al., 2004). lugnier et al. (1999) discussed that
because the km value of pde4 for camp hydrolysis is higher than that
of  xxxg1695xxx , the participation of pde4 in camp hydrolysis may be allowed
by the  xxxg1695xxx  inhibition in rat aorta. thus, a possible interpretation of
our ﬁndings is that, because the disinhibition of  xxxg1695xxx  activity occurs
under the no/cgmp signaling suppression, a pde4 inhibitor fails to be
effective.
unlike these selective pde inhibitors,  xxxd2314xxx  potently relaxed
intracranial arteries regardless of the activity of no/cgmp signaling.
judging from above,  xxxd2314xxx , a mixed  xxxg1695xxx /4 inhibitor, probably
exerts its vasorelaxing effect in the intracranial artery mainly by
inhibiting  xxxg1695xxx  under suppressed no/cgmp signaling and by inhibiting pde4 under normal conditions. such a compensation by
 xxxg1695xxx - or pde4-inhibition depending on the no/cgmp signaling
change would produce the no/cgmp-independent feature. fig. 6
illustrates a postulated mechanism underlying the vasorelaxation
caused by selective  xxxg1695xxx  or pde4 inhibitors and  xxxd2314xxx  in the
intracranial vertebrobasilar arteries.
in conclusion, this study shows that vasoselectivity of  xxxd2314xxx , a
mixed  xxxg1695xxx /4 inhibitor, for the intracranial vertebrobasilar arteries
may be based on inhibition of both  xxxg1695xxx  and pde4, and that vasorelaxation induced by  xxxd2314xxx  is independent of no/cgmp signaling
because of its vasorelaxation compensated by either  xxxg1695xxx - or pde4inhibition depending on the state of no/cgmp signaling change.
