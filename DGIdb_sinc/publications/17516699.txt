abstract

objective: the oral direct thrombin inhibitor (oral dti)  xxxd3538xxx  and its
active form, melagatran, which can be administered subcutaneously, were investigated for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic complications.
design and patients: in this randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallelgroup study in patients (n = 90) undergoing general abdominal and/or pelvic
surgery, 8-day and 35-day treatment regimens of postoperatively initiated subcutaneous (sc) melagatran (3mg twice daily) followed by oral  xxxd3538xxx  (24mg
twice daily) were compared with standard-duration sc  xxxd1805xxx  (5000iu) initiated preoperatively. pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters, efficacy
(number of patients with distal and/or proximal deep vein thrombosis [dvt]
verified by bilateral venography on the final day of treatment) and safety were
assessed.
results: the pharmacokinetics of melagatran were well described by a onecompartment model with first-order absorption after administration of both sc
melagatran and oral  xxxd3538xxx . bioavailability of melagatran was 21% after
the first oral dose of  xxxd3538xxx  and was virtually unchanged throughout the
study. activated partial thromboplastin time increased in a non-linear manner
with plasma melagatran concentration. the overall rate of dvt was 11.4% (8/70),
with events distributed evenly between treatment groups. bleeding volumes
during surgery tended to be higher in the  xxxd1805xxx  group than in the melagatran/
 xxxd3538xxx  groups. blood transfusion volumes and numbers of patients transfused were similar in all treatment groups.
conclusions: good bioavailability of melagatran was achieved following oral
administration of  xxxd3538xxx . postoperative sc melagatran followed by oral
 xxxd3538xxx  appeared to be well tolerated, and the efficacy of standard-length or

prolonged prophylaxis with sc melagatran and oral  xxxd3538xxx  may be comparable to that of  xxxd1805xxx  initiated preoperatively.

there is consensus on the necessity of prophylaxis against postoperative venous thromboembolism
(vte) following high-risk operations such as major
orthopaedic surgery and general surgery for malignant disorders. without prophylaxis, the risk of fatal
pulmonary embolism (pe) is approximately 1%.[1]
during the last decade, low-molecular-weight heparins (lmwhs) have been a frequent means of prophylaxis for vte. nonetheless, the optimal approach to the prevention of vte following high-risk
surgery remains unclear – in particular, the timing of
the initiation of therapy and the length of treatment.
the results of a randomised study of the lmwh
 xxxd1805xxx  have demonstrated the efficacy and safety
of this agent whether prophylaxis is initiated pre- or
postoperatively in close proximity to surgery.[2] in
addition, certain high-risk patient groups might benefit from prolonged prophylaxis following surgery.
for example, in patients undergoing elective hip
surgery, prophylaxis for 1 month significantly
reduces venographically diagnosed deep vein
thrombosis (dvt) compared with prophylaxis for
1 week.[3-7]
recent studies have indicated that the direct
thrombin inhibitor hirudin may be superior to
lmwh as prophylaxis in patients undergoing elective hip surgery.[8] this finding could be explained
by the ability of direct thrombin inhibitors to inhibit
clot-bound thrombin in addition to circulating
thrombin. synthetic direct thrombin inhibitors have
been developed with the potential to replace
lmwhs and oral anticoagulants such as the vitamin
k antagonists (e.g. warfarin) in the prevention and
treatment of vte.
 xxxd3538xxx  (exanta™, astrazeneca, mölndal,
sweden),1 a novel oral direct thrombin inhibitor, is
rapidly absorbed and bioconverted to melagatran, its
active form.[9] melagatran, a selective, competitive,
1

small-molecule direct thrombin inhibitor,[10] has
shown promising antithrombotic effects in animal
models of experimental venous thrombosis.[11-14]
following subcutaneous (sc) administration of melagatran in healthy volunteers, the bioavailability of
melagatran is complete, resulting in low variability
in exposure.[15] in healthy subjects,  xxxd3538xxx  is
well tolerated. after single and repeated oral dosing
of  xxxd3538xxx , the bioavailability of melagatran is
approximately 20%.[16] melagatran itself is not further metabolised and is mainly (~80%) renally excreted.[15] the efficacy and safety of oral  xxxd3538xxx , or sequential therapy with sc melagatran followed by oral  xxxd3538xxx , have been established
in several studies of vte prevention following total
hip or total knee replacement.[17-21] in addition, the
efficacy and safety of oral  xxxd3538xxx  for the
treatment and long-term secondary prevention of
vte[22,23] and the prevention of stroke in patients
with atrial fibrillation[24] have been reported. in
comparison with patients undergoing orthopaedic
surgery, patients undergoing major abdominal or
pelvic surgery are more likely to experience postoperative disturbances in gastrointestinal motility.
therefore, an assessment of the bioavailability of
 xxxd3538xxx  in this population is warranted.
the purpose of the present study was to evaluate
the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of sc
melagatran, initiated postoperatively, followed by
oral  xxxd3538xxx  administered as two different
treatment regimens (standard-length and prolonged
prophylaxis) in patients undergoing general abdominal and/or pelvic surgery. in addition, the safety and
efficacy of the two sc melagatran/oral  xxxd3538xxx 
treatment regimens were compared with those of
preoperatively initiated  xxxd1805xxx  administered as
standard-duration thromboprophylaxis.

thromboprophylaxis with melagatran/ xxxd3538xxx 

patients and methods

study design and treatments

this international, randomised, double-blind,
double-dummy, parallel-group study was conducted
in nine centres in sweden and norway. the study
was approved by the local ethics committees at the
participating centres and was performed in accordance with the principles stated in the declaration of
helsinki. written informed consent was obtained
from all patients.
the patients were randomised (via computergenerated, blinded block randomisation not stratified by country, centre or any other factor) to receive
one of three treatment regimens:
group 1: sc melagatran 3mg twice daily, started
12–24 hours after surgery and maintained until the
patient was able to receive oral  xxxd3538xxx  (24mg
twice daily, starting from postoperative day 3). oral
 xxxd3538xxx  treatment was continued until postoperative day 35 ± 3.
group 2: sc melagatran 3mg twice daily, started
12–24 hours after surgery and maintained until the
patient was able to receive oral  xxxd3538xxx  (24mg
twice daily, starting from postoperative day 3). oral
 xxxd3538xxx  treatment was continued until postoperative day 8, followed by placebo until postoperative day 35 ± 3.
group 3: sc  xxxd1805xxx  (5000iu once daily), started preoperatively (given the evening before surgery)
and continued until postoperative day 5. if the patient remained hospitalised,  xxxd1805xxx  was given
once daily on postoperative days 6 and 7. the total
active treatment period lasted 7–9 days and was
followed by placebo until postoperative day 35 ± 3.
for blinding purposes, a double-dummy technique was used. prefilled syringes of  xxxd3213xxx , with the same appearance as the syringes containing melagatran and  xxxd1805xxx , were provided.
placebo tablets with the same appearance as the
 xxxd3538xxx  tablets were also provided.

subjects

patients were enrolled if they were scheduled for
general open abdominal and/or pelvic surgery with a
planned duration ≥30 minutes and a planned hospital stay ≥5 days, were ≥40 years of age, and weighed
between 50 and 110kg. in addition, in order to be
enrolled, patients were expected to have an anticipated survival rate >6 months and be able to undergo bilateral venography.
exclusion criteria were: severe post-thrombotic
state; trauma with immobilisation within 12 weeks
prior to surgery; leg amputation; treatment with
anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs within 7 days
prior to surgery (≤500mg daily of aspirin or shortacting, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
[nsaids] with a half-life <20h were allowed);
known allergy to venographic contrast media; contraindications for lmwh, melagatran or  xxxd3538xxx  treatment; conditions associated with increased
risk of bleeding or known haemostatic disorder;
systolic blood pressure >200mm hg or diastolic
blood pressure >110mm hg; renal impairment (serum creatinine >150 mumol/l) or known active liver
disease, liver insufficiency, or aspartate (ast) and/
or alanine (alt) aminotransferase levels greater
than twice the upper limit of the laboratory references and/or of clinical significance. patients were
also excluded if they had anaemia (haemoglobin
<80 g/l), thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100 ×
109/l), known drug addiction and/or alcohol abuse
or any condition that prevented them from understanding the aims, investigational procedures or
possible consequences of the study.
concomitant medication

the following groups of medication were not
allowed within 7 days prior to surgery or during the
study drug administration period: heparins (except
the lmwh used in the trial or any used in connection with the intraoperative salvage of red blood
cells), oral anticoagulants, thrombolytic agents,  xxxd1914xxx ,  xxxd3256xxx , ticlopidine or clopidogrel, long-acting nsaids with a half-life >20
hours and aspirin >500mg daily.

treatment with dextran-40 or dextran-70 was
discouraged. however, dextran was allowed as a
plasma volume expander at the discretion of the
physician.

safety assessments

efficacy assessments

efficacy was assessed as the number of patients
with verified distal and/or proximal dvt and/or pe
on the final day of treatment (day 35 ± 3). dvt was
diagnosed by mandatory bilateral ascending venography.[25] the finding of a constant intraluminalfilling defect on at least two images was regarded as
the criterion for a ‘new’ dvt.
the venograms were evaluated locally at each
centre for the presence or absence of thrombi. in
addition, two independent radiologists who were
blinded to study treatment evaluated the venograms
centrally for adequacy, the presence or absence of
thrombi, and the size of the thrombi. for a venogram
to be adequate and included in the analysis, it should
be bilateral with all nine vein segments evaluable
(with an exception for the deep femoral vein). venographies with missing or nonevaluable veins, but
with a confirmed dvt in any vein, were also included in the analysis.
clinical signs and symptoms of pe were verified
by perfusion scintigraphy. if an abnormal perfusion
scintigraphy was obtained, pulmonary ventilation
scintigraphy and chest radiography were performed.
the diagnosis of pe was based on the biello criteria
for high probability of pe.[26] clinical signs of pe
could also be verified by pulmonary angiography or
spiral computerised tomography (ct) of the pulmonary arteries and/or its branches, where intraluminal-filling defects were regarded as confirmation of pe.
dvt and pe were treated according to local
clinical practice following discontinuation of the
study drug. if venography was performed before the
final day of treatment (i.e. before postoperative day
35 ± 3), patients were discontinued from study treatment. patients with clinical signs and symptoms of
pe were not discontinued from study treatment if a
negative pulmonary scintigram, angiogram or spiral
ct scan was obtained. in this case, the patient would

bleeding (volume of blood loss and transfused
volume of whole blood, red blood cells and plasma
expanders) and the concentration of haemoglobin in
blood were recorded throughout the study. severe
bleeding was defined as follows: intracranial, intraocular, intraspinal or retroperitoneal bleeding; excessive bleeding as judged by the investigator; and
bleeding leading to reoperation or death.
subcutaneous bleeding, >5cm in diameter,
during the sc injection was recorded on the casereport form and was not regarded as an adverse
event.
pharmacodynamic and
pharmacokinetic assessments

venous blood samples for the determination of
melagatran plasma concentrations and the coagulation parameter, activated partial thromboplastin
time (aptt), were collected in 5ml citrated tubes
on the first postoperative day (predose and 0.5, 1, 2,
4 and 8h postdose), on the first day of oral treatment
(postoperative day 3–8, at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10h postdose), and on the final day of oral treatment (postoperative day 35 ± 3, at 2 and 4h postdose).
the blood samples were centrifuged and the plasma recovered, divided into two equal volumes
and transferred to cryo tubes. the samples were
frozen and stored at –20°c until analysis. plasma
concentrations were adjusted by a factor of 1.85 for
the dilution of blood in the sampling tubes with
citrate buffer. blood samples were collected from all
patients, thus maintaining blindness.
plasma samples were analysed at a central laboratory (quintiles ab, uppsala, sweden) to determine
the concentration of melagatran. the plasma melagatran concentration was determined by a liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry method after
solid-phase extraction as described previously.[27]
the lower limit of quantitation was 0.01 mumol/l.

statistical analysis

results
a sample size of 90 patients was selected, anticipating that approximately 15% of enrolled patients
would have venograms inadequate for evaluation.
thus, it was expected that 25 patients from each
treatment group would be evaluated according to the
protocol.
the combined frequency of dvt and/or pe was
assessed by estimated proportions (with 95% confidence intervals [cis]) within treatment groups and
estimated differences in proportions (with 95% cis)
between treatment groups.
the safety analysis included all patients who
received at least one dose of the study drug and who
underwent surgery. the volume of blood loss and
the volume of blood transfused were combined in
both sc melagatran and oral  xxxd3538xxx  treatment
groups and compared with the  xxxd1805xxx  group. the
volume of blood loss (during surgery) was presented
descriptively, and the change in median volume
between the sc melagatran and oral  xxxd3538xxx 
treatment groups and the  xxxd1805xxx  group was estimated with a 95% ci.
the plasma concentration of melagatran and the
pharmacodynamic variable aptt were evaluated
using descriptive statistics.
a population pharmacokinetic model, based on a
model that was derived from previous studies in
patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery, was developed to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters.[28] a
one-compartment model with first-order oral absorption was used to describe the data. the pharmacokinetic parameters estimated were: bioavailability
(f), melagatran clearance (cl/f), volume of distribution (v/f) and absorption rate constants (ka) for
sc melagatran and oral  xxxd3538xxx . the bioavailability of oral  xxxd3538xxx  relative to sc melagatran
was estimated as the ratio of the respective clearance
values (i.e. sc melagatran divided by oral  xxxd3538xxx ). covariate relationships for melagatran clearance and volume of distribution were evaluated. the
population mean and interpatient variability were

patients were enrolled. of these, two patients did not
meet the eligibility criteria, four patients withdrew
informed consent, and five patients were discontinued for other reasons, leaving 90 patients for
randomisation. following randomisation, four patients in the sc melagatran and oral  xxxd3538xxx 
8-day treatment group did not undergo surgery owing to cancellation of the operation. none of these
patients reported any adverse events. hence, the
safety population was defined as all patients who
received at least one dose of study drug and underwent surgery. the safety population consisted of 86
patients (48 men and 38 women). of the 86 patients,
30 received the sc melagatran and oral  xxxd3538xxx 
35-day treatment, 27 received the sc melagatran and
oral  xxxd3538xxx  8-day treatment, and 29 received
 xxxd1805xxx .
the intention-to-treat (itt) efficacy population
was as for the safety population. excluding patients
with protocol violations (22 patients did not receive
the study drug appropriately, six did not have bilateral venography, and two had taken prohibited medication) yielded a per-protocol population of 20, 16
and 20 patients in the three groups, respectively.
baseline characteristics of the three treatment
groups were similar (table i). the majority of operations were performed for colorectal disease.
thromboembolic events

venograms adequate for evaluation were obtained in 70 patients (25, 22 and 23 in the sc melagatran and oral  xxxd3538xxx  35-day, sc melagatran
and oral  xxxd3538xxx  8-day and  xxxd1805xxx  groups,
respectively), and dvt was confirmed in eight patients (11.4%; three, three and two patients, respectively). the frequency of dvt (95% ci) was 12.0%
(2.6, 31.2), 13.6% (2.9, 34.9) and 8.7% (1.1, 28.0) in
the sc melagatran and oral  xxxd3538xxx  35-day, sc

thromboprophylaxis with melagatran/ xxxd3538xxx 

minor bleeding did not differ between groups. the
frequency of bleeding was 23.3, 18.5 and 13.8% in
the sc melagatran and oral  xxxd3538xxx  35-day,
sc melagatran and oral  xxxd3538xxx  8-day, and
 xxxd1805xxx  groups, respectively. the bleeding events
included gastrointestinal (one), haematuria (five),
positive haemoglobin in faeces (one) and petechiae
(one).
perioperative bleeding was slightly higher in the
 xxxd1805xxx  group (median [range]: 400ml [0–5000])
compared with patients in the sc melagatran and oral
 xxxd3538xxx  groups who did not receive prophylaxis during the operation (275 [0–3000] and 300ml
[0–2000] in the 35-day and 8-day groups, respectively). there were no significant differences between treatment groups in transfusion volumes,
either intra- or postoperatively.
pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics

plasma concentrations of melagatran versus time
after dosing are shown by sampling day in figure 1.
the means (± sd) of the observed maximum plasma
concentrations were 277 (± 66) nmol/l after sc
melagatran on postoperative day 1 and 197 (± 116)
nmol/l after oral  xxxd3538xxx  on the first day of
oral  xxxd3538xxx  treatment (postoperative day 3–8).
a one-compartment model with first-order absorption described the data following sc melagatran
and oral  xxxd3538xxx  administration. melagatran
clearance correlated with calculated creatinine
clearance, and the volume of distribution correlated

133

with bodyweight. mean population estimates of the
pharmacokinetic parameters for a patient with a
creatinine clearance of 70 ml/min and a bodyweight
of 75kg are shown in table ii. the residual interindividual variability for the pharmacokinetic parameters, not accounted for by the relationships to
creatinine clearance and bodyweight, is also given.
for the range of creatinine clearance in the studied
patient population (32–110 ml/min), the modelpredicted clearances of melagatran were 4.0–9.3 l/h
for sc melagatran and 17.5–37.8 l/h for oral  xxxd3538xxx . similarly, for the range of bodyweights in
studied patients (51–110kg), the volumes of distribution were 15–28l for sc melagatran and
130–242l for oral  xxxd3538xxx . thus, approximately 2-fold differences were predicted between
the minimum and maximum values.
the bioavailability of melagatran, calculated as
the ratio of sc clearance divided by oral clearance,
was slightly lower (21%) following the first oral
dose on day 3–8 compared with the final day of
treatment on day 35 ± 3 (24%).
the half-life of melagatran, derived from the
population estimates of clearance and volume of
distribution, was 2.0h for sc melagatran and 4.1h for
oral  xxxd3538xxx .
aptt was not affected following  xxxd1805xxx  treatment but was prolonged in patients who received sc
melagatran and oral  xxxd3538xxx  (figure 2). there
was a non-linear relationship between aptt and
plasma concentration of melagatran (figure 3).

discussion
the results of this study indicated that postoperative standard-length or prolonged prophylaxis
with sc melagatran followed by oral  xxxd3538xxx  is
well tolerated and efficacious.
a one-compartment model, with first-order absorption/formation rate, was used to describe the
disposition of melagatran after both sc melagatran
and oral  xxxd3538xxx  administration. the population estimates of clearance and volume of distribution in the present study were in agreement with

those of a study in patients undergoing orthopaedic
surgery.[28] also in agreement with the results of the
study in orthopaedic surgery patients, the clearance
was shown to be influenced by creatinine clearance,
a relationship that was to be expected since melagatran is predominantly renally cleared.[15] the ratio of
sc clearance and oral clearance was estimated, suggesting a bioavailability of 21% for melagatran after
oral administration of the first dose of  xxxd3538xxx 
and of 24% on the final day of treatment (postoperative day 35 ± 3). this result is consistent with
that estimated in healthy young and elderly subjects.[29] these findings suggest that any changes in
gastric motility due to surgery do not influence the
bioavailability of melagatran. interindividual variability in melagatran clearance after oral administration of  xxxd3538xxx  was somewhat higher than that
after sc melagatran, which is presumably because of
variability in the oral absorption and bioconversion
of  xxxd3538xxx .
the volume of distribution for sc melagatran is
consistent with that determined previously after administration of melagatran to healthy young and
elderly subjects,[29] and is related to bodyweight.
subcutaneous melagatran and oral  xxxd3538xxx 
were well tolerated. postoperative bleeding, volume
of blood transfused, and bleeding complications
were comparable between the sc melagatran and
oral  xxxd3538xxx  groups and the  xxxd1805xxx  group.
adverse events were also comparable between the
groups.
the frequency of vte was low and comparable
between the groups. the overall frequency of dvt
was 11%, which compares favourably with the results of other studies in patients undergoing highrisk abdominal surgery.[30] the study was not powered to evaluate a statistical difference in efficacy
and safety between the treatment regimens.
conclusion
the bioavailability of melagatran was about
20%, both shortly after surgery and at the end of the
treatment period (postoperative day 35 ± 3). subcutaneous melagatran administered postoperatively
followed by oral  xxxd3538xxx  may be efficacious

fig. 3. activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt) ratio (relative to predose aptt levels) vs plasma concentration of melagatran after
administration of subcutaneous melagatran 3mg twice daily on postoperative day 1, and after administration of the first oral  xxxd3538xxx 
24mg twice daily on postoperative day 3–8 (first day of oral treatment) and the final day of treatment. a fitted curve from a repeated
