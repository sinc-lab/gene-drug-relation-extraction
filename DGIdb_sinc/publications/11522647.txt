abstract
the expression of the activated mitogen-activated kinases/extracellular
signal-regulated kinases (erks)  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx  was characterized in
101 human head and neck squamous carcinoma specimens. activated
 xxxg1369xxx /2 were detected at different levels in the majority of these tumors,
as assayed by immunostaining with an antibody specific for the dually
phosphorylated and activated  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx .  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation levels
were higher in tumors with advanced regional lymph node metastasis
(p ⴝ 0.048) and in relapsed tumors (p ⴝ 0.021). the expression of
 xxxg681xxx  (egf) receptor (p ⴝ 0.037), transforming
growth factor ␣ (tgf-␣; p < 0.001), and her2 (p ⴝ 0.066; positive
trend) correlated with activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2. in a multivariate analysis,
both tgf-␣ (p < 0.0001) and her2 (p ⴝ 0.045) were independently
correlated with  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation. in turn, activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 was
associated with a higher ki-67 proliferative index (p ⴝ 0.002). in egf
receptor-dependent model cells (a431 and difi), a specific egf receptor
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor (“iressa”;  xxxd2186xxx ) and a chimeric anti-egf
receptor antibody (“cetuximab”;  xxxd467xxx ) inhibited erk 1/2 activation at
concentrations that inhibited autocrine cell proliferation. in patients on
treatment with  xxxd467xxx , the activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 in skin, an egf receptordependent tissue, was lower compared with control skin. parallel changes
were seen in keratinocyte ki67 proliferation indexes in skin from c225treated patients. taken together, these studies provide support for a role
of activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 in head and neck squamous carcinoma and a
correlation with egf receptor/tgf-␣ expression. the inhibition of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 activation in vitro and in vivo by compounds targeting the egf
receptor points to the interest of  xxxg1369xxx /2 as potential surrogate markers
of egf-receptor signaling in clinical therapeutic studies.

introduction
the egf5 receptor is a mr 170,000 plasma membrane glycoprotein
composed of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane lipophilic segment, and an intracellular protein kinase domain
with a regulatory cooh-terminal segment (1). after ligand binding,
egf-receptor dimerization occurs, which results in high-affinity ligand binding, activation of the intrinsic protein  xxxg2198xxx  activreceived 7/17/00; accepted 7/2/01.

ity, and tyrosine autophosphorylation (1). these events lead to activation of a cascade of biochemical and physiological responses that
are involved in the mitogenic signal transduction of cells (2). extensive preclinical studies (2, 3) have shown that these downstream
signaling transduction cascades regulate multiple cellular processes
such as proliferation, differentiation, survival, and transformation.
several lines of evidence support the egf receptor as a target for
therapy of head and neck carcinomas. egf receptor and one of its
ligands, tgf-␣, are overexpressed in the majority of head and neck
tumors (ref. 4 and references therein), and this overexpression correlates with a poor clinical outcome. furthermore, inhibitors of receptor function such as mabs and  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors have
antiproliferative effects on egf receptor-expressing cancer cells (5–
8). recently (9 –11), clinical studies have demonstrated activity of
anti-egf receptor therapies in patients with advanced malignancies,
and studies are currently under way with these agents in patients with
head and neck carcinomas.
as these agents move into the clinic, a better understanding of the
egf receptor-dependent pathways in vivo and their pattern of expression/activation would be of interest for at least two reasons. first, they
may be of assistance in predicting the subset of egf receptor-positive
tumors that will benefit from therapy; second, downstream signaling
transduction molecules may prove to be useful surrogate markers of
complete receptor blockade. this latest point is particularly relevant
with this novel type of agents because an optimal biological dose (i.e.,
a dose resulting in complete receptor inhibition) would be preferred to
the maximally tolerated dose that is being used with conventional
nontargeted chemotherapeutic agents (12).
a major signaling route of egf receptor is the ras-raf-mapk
pathway (2). activation of ras initiates a multistep phosphorylation
cascade that leads to the activation of mapks (13). the mapks
 xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx  are activated by dual phosphorylation on a tyrosine
and a threonine residue by dual specificity kinases.  xxxg1369xxx /2 subsequently regulate cell transcription and have been linked to cell proliferation, survival, and transformation in laboratory studies (13).
elevated levels of mapk activation in tumor tissues compared with
their corresponding non-neoplastic tissues have been reported recently
(14 –21) in several human tumors, although it remains uncharacterized
in head and neck carcinomas.
in the present study, we have analyzed in a large series of head and
neck squamous carcinomas the expression of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 and
their relationship with egf receptor/tgf-␣ expression and proliferation in a clinical setting. activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 were assessed by immunostaining with an antibody specific for the dually phosphorylated and
activated mapks  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx  (phospho- xxxd1355xxx /42 mapk; ref.
22). we have found that activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 were present at different
levels in the majority of tumors, and expression levels were correlated
with egf receptor/tgf-␣ expression and with the tumor proliferative

index. we then explored whether the level of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2
expression could be used as a marker of egf-receptor function
inhibition and antiproliferative effects of anti-egf receptor-targeted
therapies. using two human tumor cell lines that have extensively
been characterized to be egf receptor-dependent, we observed a
marked correlation between cell growth suppression and inhibition of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 activation with two anti-egf receptor agents currently in
clinical trials, the  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2186xxx  (iressa6) and the
mab  xxxd467xxx  (cetuximab7). in addition, we show in skin, a wellcharacterized egf receptor-dependent tissue (23–27), from patients
treated with  xxxd467xxx  that the activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 was lower compared
with control skin. this decrease in activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 was accompanied by a decrease in keratinocyte proliferation. taken together, these
studies show that activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 are present and correlated with
egf receptor/tgf-␣ in head and neck tumors and that they are
potential surrogate markers of egf-receptor activation or inhibition
that should be further explored in the clinic.
materials and methods
tissues. archival tissue specimens from patients with head and neck
squamous carcinoma were retrieved from the department of pathology (vall
d’hebron university hospital, barcelona, spain) following institutional guidelines. a series of 101 primary tumors was assayed for the expression of
activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 and the assessment of the potential relationships between
activated  xxxg1369xxx /2, egf-receptor signaling components (egf receptor, tgf-␣,
and her2 receptor), and proliferative index (ki-67). we also analyzed paired
primary tumors and relapsed tissue specimens from 19 patients of this series
who suffered a relapse. overall, 120 specimens were analyzed from the 101
patients. demographic and treatment data had been recorded previously.
clinical tumor staging was performed according to the tnm classification of
malignant tumors (28). slides were reviewed for tumor grade.
we also studied 10 control skin samples (i.e., from patients not treated with
egf-receptor inhibitors) from our pathology archives and skin samples from
four head and neck cancer patients participating in clinical trials with  xxxd467xxx .
two biopsies from these  xxxd467xxx -treated patients were from rashes that developed during treatment with  xxxd467xxx  plus radiation therapy. the other two patients
were on treatment with  xxxd467xxx  plus cisplatin, and biopsies were from macroscopically normal skin. in one of them, a paired baseline (before  xxxd467xxx 
treatment) skin biopsy was also available. a separate written informed consent
was obtained for these skin biopsies.
compounds and antibodies. egf receptor  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor
 xxxd2186xxx  (kindly provided by astrazeneca; ref. 7) and anti-egf receptor mab
 xxxd467xxx  (kindly provided by imclone systems; ref. 5) were used for in vitro
assays. the primary antibodies used were: rabbit polyclonal phospho- xxxd1355xxx /42
mapk (thr202/tyr204) antibody to activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 (new england biolabs inc., beverly, ma), rabbit polyclonal  xxxg1369xxx /2 antibody to total  xxxg1369xxx /2
(new england biolabs inc.), mouse antibody to external domain of egf
receptor (biogenex, san ramon, ca), mouse mab ab2 to tgf-␣ (oncogene
science, cambridge, ma), mouse mab cb-11 to her2 (biogenex), and
mouse mab b126.1 to ki-67 (biomeda corp., foster city, ca). two negative
control rabbit polyclonal immunoglobulins (biogenex; santa cruz biotechnology inc., santa cruz, ca) and a negative control mouse monoclonal
immunoglobulin (biogenex) were also used.
immunohistochemistry. all of the specimens had been fixed in 10%
buffered neutral formalin, dehydrated, and paraffin embedded. immunostaining was performed using 4-␮m tissue sections placed on poly-l-lysinecoated glass slides. after deparaffinization in xylene and graded alcohols,
epitope retrieval was performed. target retrieval for activated  xxxg1369xxx /2,
tgf-␣, her2, and ki-67 was made in 10 mm edta buffer (ph 8) for 10 min
in a microwave at 600 w. epitope retrieval for egf receptor was made by
pepsin digestion for 10 min. after epitope retrieval, endogenous peroxidase
was blocked by immersing the sections in 0.03%  xxxd2298xxx  for 15
min. slides were washed for 5 min with pbs. incubations with primary

antibodies were made at room temperature for 1 h at the following dilutions:
activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 1:50, total  xxxg1369xxx /2 1:50, egf receptor 1:30, tgf-␣ 1:50,
her2 1:20, and ki-67 1:1 (prediluted form). the peroxidase-labeled polymer
conjugated to goat antirabbit (activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 and total  xxxg1369xxx /2) or antimouse (egf receptor, tgf-␣, her2, and ki-67) method was used to detect
antigen-antibody reaction (dako envision⫹ system; dako corporation,
carpinteria, ca) for 30 min at room temperature. sections were then visualized with 3,3⬘-diaminobenzidine as a chromogen for 5 min and counterstained
with mayer’s hematoxylin. slides were washed in tap water, dehydrated, and
mounted with glass coverslips. positive controls were sections of a tissue
specimen previously found to be positive for the antigen of interest. the
negative controls consisted of duplicate sections of the same specimens in
which the primary antibody had been excluded and replaced with pbs or
negative control immunoglobulins. the controls for activated and total
 xxxg1369xxx /2 were stained with the same amount of antihuman polyclonal rabbit
igg instead of the primary antibodies. the controls for egf receptor, tgf-␣,
her2, and ki-67 were stained with the same amount of antihuman monoclonal mouse igg instead of the primary antibodies. representative tumor
sections were identified on a light microscope with an ocular magnification of
⫻25. to score a tumor cell as positive for a given marker, complete membrane
staining was required for egf receptor and her2, cytoplasmic or membrane
staining for tgf-␣, and nuclear staining for activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 or ki67. the
percentage of stained tumor cells was scored from these sections in 10
high-power fields (⫻400), and the average percentage of tumor cell staining
for each antibody was calculated (by f. r.). tumors with ⬎1% of tumor cells
staining for a given marker were considered positive for such marker (29).
grading of positivity ranged from a score of 1% to 100%. this scoring
was used for statistical correlation analysis between the studied markers
and was not intended to provide a clinical cutoff value. the same scoring
system was used for skin specimens. scoring was blinded to the clinical data.
cells and monolayer growth assay. two human tumor cell lines that
overexpress the egf receptor, a431 vulvar squamous carcinoma cells and
difi colon adenocarcinoma cells (5, 6), were used in this study. we confirmed
the overexpression of the egf receptor in both a431 and difi cells by
immunocytochemistry, although we did not detect her2 staining. cells were
grown in monolayer culture with dmem:ham’s f-12 (1:1) with 10% fbs at
37°c and 5% co2. for monolayer growth assay, cells were seeded in 6-well
culture plates (model 3046; falcon, lincoln park, nj) at 104 cells/cm2. the
next day, cells were changed to medium containing 0.5% fbs for 18 h, and
 xxxd2186xxx  or  xxxd467xxx  was added at various concentrations to the cultures. after
72 h, cells were washed once with pbs, harvested with 0.1%  xxxg1852xxx  mm
edta in pbs, and counted with a coulter counter.
western immunoblotting. western immunoblotting was performed as
reported previously (6) with minor modifications. cells were seeded in parallel
and under the same conditions as for monolayer growth assays. the monolayers were then exposed to the indicated concentrations of  xxxd2186xxx  or  xxxd467xxx .
after 2 h, the medium was removed, the cells were washed twice with cold
pbs, and the monolayer was scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer [50 mm
hepes (ph 7.0), 10% glycerol, 1% triton x-100, 5 mm edta, 1 mm mgcl2,
25 mm naf, 50 ␮g/ml apronitin, 50 ␮g/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm orthovanadate,
and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride]. the lysates were transferred to a
clean microfuge tube, placed on ice for 15 min, and centrifuged for 10 min at
14,000 rpm. the supernatant was transferred to a clean microfuge tube, and
protein concentration was determined. protein extracts (50 ␮g) were boiled in
laemmli buffer 2⫻ and resolved on a 10% sds-polyacrylamide gel, before
transferring to a nitrocellulose membrane. membranes were blocked in trisbuffered saline [50 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.4), 150 mm nacl] with 5% nonfat milk
overnight at 4°c and then incubated with antibodies to total  xxxg1369xxx /2 (1:1000)
or to activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 (1:1000) for 2 h at room temperature. subsequently,
membranes were washed three times for 5 min each in the same solution and
then incubated for 60 –90 min with an antirabbit igg horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody (amersham pharmacia biotech, freiburg, germany). subsequently, membranes were vigorously washed four times for 5
min each in the same solution, followed by a quick incubation using
an ultra supersignal chemiluminescence substrate (pierce, rockford,
illinois).
immunocytochemistry. cells were seeded on positive-charged slides
placed in culture plates under the same conditions used for monolayer
growth assays and western blot assays. on the next day, cells were changed

to medium containing 0.5% fbs for 18 h, and then  xxxd2186xxx  or  xxxd467xxx  was
added at the indicated concentrations to the cultures for 2 h. after 2 h, the
slides were removed from the culture plates, and cells on the slides were
fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde solution at 4°c for 30 min and then treated
with 1% bsa and 0.1% saponine to permebealize cells at room temperature
for 30 min. nonspecific protein reactivity was blocked with protein block
(biogenex) for 10 min, and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked in
 xxxd2298xxx  solution at 0.01% for 10 min. the antibodies used were
the same as for the immunohistochemistry assays. specimens were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the antibody to total  xxxg1369xxx /2
(dilution, 1:100) or to activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 (dilution, 1:100). immunodetection of antigens was made with super sensitive immunodetection system
(biogenex). to detect the binding of antibody to antigen, slides were
incubated with biotinylated antirabbit-immunoglobulins for 20 min at room
temperature and then with horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin
complexes for 20 min at room temperature. slides were then visualized
using 3–3⬘-diaminobenzidine as a chromogen for 1 min. then, specimens
were dehydrated and coverslipped in nonaqueous permanent mounting
media. positive and negative controls were included in each staining run.
statistical methods. all of the statistical analyses were carried out using
spss data analysis program version 9.0. a kolmogorov-smirnov test was
applied to determine whether a variable followed a normal distribution.
pearson’s correlations were made between continuous variables (i.e., percentage of squamous carcinoma cell staining) that followed a normal distribution
in our series of 101 tumors, and nonparametric spearman’s correlations were
made when one or both of the covariables did not follow a normal distribution.
activated  xxxg1369xxx /2, egf receptor, and ki67 followed a normal distribution and
tgf-␣ did not. in the case of her2, because most of the tumors were zeros
(n ⫽ 82), correlation was calculated only for those tumors that were her2
positive (n ⫽ 19) and followed a normal distribution. a multivariate regression
analysis that included all of the cases was planned to assess the independent
value of the association between all of the egf receptor-signaling members
analyzed that may interact in vivo (i.e., egf receptor, tgf-␣, and her2) and
activated  xxxg1369xxx /2, assessed on a continuous scale. paired samples were analyzed using the t test for paired samples. the relationship between categorical
variables and continuous variables was analyzed by the fisher’s exact test or
mann-whitney u test. all of the statistical tests were conducted at the
two-sided 0.05 level of significance.

squamous carcinoma specimens were analyzed for activated  xxxg1369xxx /2.

had received prior therapy, which consisted of chemotherapy and
radiation.
the antibody used in the present study detects  xxxg1369xxx /2 only when
catalytically activated by phosphorylation at thr202 and tyr204, and
its specificity has been shown previously (e.g., see ref. 22). positive
nuclear staining for activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 was seen in some basal and
parabasal epithelial cells of oral mucosa and in cells from minor
salivary glands in adjacent non-neoplastic squamous epithelium. activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 was also detected in endothelial cells, smooth muscle
cells, schwann cells, and fibroblasts. these nonmalignant cells had a
weak cytoplasmic pattern and occasionally intense nuclear staining.
lymphocytes and plasma cells did not stain. endothelial cells and
lymphocytes were considered as internal positive and negative controls for each slide, as used by others (fig. 1a; ref. 19). a subset
(n ⫽ 20) of tumors was analyzed with an antibody to total  xxxg1369xxx /2.

numbers represent total number of patients for each characteristic (except for age).
because the total number of patients was 101, no percentages are given.

diffuse cytoplasmic staining was seen with this antibody to total
 xxxg1369xxx /2 in the majority of epithelial and stromal cells. nuclear staining for total  xxxg1369xxx /2 was observed in some tumor cells located in
areas that had tumor cells with nuclear staining for activated  xxxg1369xxx /2
in adjacent tissue slides (fig. 1b). this differential localization of total
 xxxg1369xxx /2 staining, mainly in the cytoplasm if phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2-negative and nuclear if phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2-positive, is most likely attributable to the activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 that involves their translocation from
the cytoplasm to the nucleus and represents further proof of the
specificity of the antibodies used (13). replacement of the primary
antibody by the same amount of negative control polyclonal rabbit
iggs (two negative controls from different sources) did not show
staining (fig. 1, c and d).
the percentage of squamous carcinoma cells with nuclei staining
for activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 varied among tumors (table 2). in head and
neck squamous carcinoma cells, staining for activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 was
seen in the nucleus, and in general, a less intense cytoplasmic staining
was seen (fig. 1a). nuclear staining was predominantly seen at the
advancing margins of the tumor. in 6 of the 101 head and neck
carcinoma specimens analyzed, a frozen tissue fragment of the same
tumor specimen that had been paraffin-embedded was available. a
western blot analysis of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 in those six samples
showed a good relationship between the scored percentage of positive
tumor nuclei staining and western blot assay results (data not shown).
higher levels of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2, measured by the percentage of
tumor nuclei cell staining in every specimen, were associated with a
more advanced n stage (n0 –2 versus n3; mann-whitney u test;
p ⫽ 0.048). poorly differentiated tumors had higher levels of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 than did well- or moderately differentiated tumors, but
the difference did not have statistical significance (p ⫽ 0.104). no
trends for associations were seen between activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 and t
stage, sex, age, or tumor site. in 19 patients who relapsed after initial
therapy, higher levels of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 in the relapsed specimens
were detected as compared with their corresponding primary tumor
specimens (fig. 1, e–f; paired t test; p ⫽ 0.021).

activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 and egf receptor signaling in tumors

fig. 1. activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 in head and neck squamous
carcinoma. a, a representative slide from a head and neck
squamous carcinoma specimen stained with an antibody specific for the dually phosphorylated and activated  xxxg1369xxx /2. a
subset of squamous carcinoma cells, mainly located in the
periphery of the tumor nest, was stained with a predominantly
nuclear pattern (black arrow). lymphocytes (white arrow)
and endothelial cells (red arrow) were used as internal negative and positive controls. b, an adjacent section to the one
in a was stained with an antibody to total (phosphorylation
state-independent)  xxxg1369xxx /2. as expected, the majority of
squamous carcinoma cells exhibited cytoplasmic staining,
whereas nuclear staining was more limited. in general, nuclear staining for total  xxxg1369xxx /2 was observed in tumor cells
located in those areas that had nuclear staining for activated
 xxxg1369xxx /2 in adjacent tissue slide. c and d, replacement of the
antibody to activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 by the same amount of negative
control polyclonal rabbit iggs [two negative controls from
different sources; rabbit polyclonal immunoglobulins from
biogenex (c) or from santa cruz biotechnology, inc. (d)]
did not show staining in a tumor specimen that was positive
for activated  xxxg1369xxx /2. e and f, a pair of a primary (e) and
relapsed (f) head and neck carcinomas from the same patient
stained with the antibody to activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 showing increased levels of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 in the relapsed specimen.

association between activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 and expression of egf
receptor-signaling family members. because  xxxg1369xxx /2 can be activated by egf receptor signaling (13), we determined the relationship
between activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 and expression of egf receptor-signaling
members, as measured by the percentage of tumor cells with positive
staining for each antibody. the molecules analyzed were the egf receptor, the egf receptor ligand tgf-␣, and the closely related her2
receptor (table 2). tgf-␣ was chosen because it is considered the

predominant egf receptor ligand expressed in malignancy (30).
her2 was included because this receptor also signals through
 xxxg1369xxx /2 and is the preferred partner for egf receptor dimerization
(2), although it is detected in a limited subset of head and neck
carcinomas (ref. 31; table 2). a significant relationship was
observed between activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 and egf receptor (n ⫽ 101;
pearson, r ⫽ 0.21; p ⫽ 0.037) and activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 and tgf-␣
(n ⫽ 101; spearman, r ⫽ 0.37; p ⬍ 0.001; fig. 2, a–b). in the case
of her2, because most of the tumors were negative (table 2), the
correlation between her2 levels and  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation was calculated only for those tumors that were her2 positive (n ⫽ 19). this
analysis showed a trend to a positive association between her2 and
 xxxg1369xxx /2 activation levels (pearson, r ⫽ 0.43; p ⫽ 0.066; fig. 2, a and
c). a linear multivariate analysis that included all of the cases was
made to assess the independent value of the association between all of
the egf receptor-signaling members analyzed that may interact
in vivo (i.e., egf receptor, tgf-␣, and her2) and activated  xxxg1369xxx /2.
in this analysis, both tgf-␣ (p ⬍ 0.0001) and her2 (p ⫽ 0.045)
were independently associated with activated  xxxg1369xxx /2. egf receptor
expression lost its statistical significance in the multivariate analysis.

association between activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 and proliferative index.
activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 drives cell proliferation (13); therefore, we
determined whether a correlation between activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 and
proliferation exists in head and neck tumors. ki-67, a nuclear proliferation-associated antigen present only in proliferating cells, was
assessed immunohistochemically to measure cell proliferation rates
(table 2 and fig. 2, d and f; ref. 32). a significant correlation was
observed between activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 and ki-67 staining (n ⫽ 101;
pearson, r ⫽ 0.30; p ⫽ 0.002; fig. 2d). further supporting the
association, the pattern of staining for both activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 and
ki-67 was predominantly located in the periphery of the tumors, a
finding that may be related to the highest level of tumor proliferation
at the edges (fig. 2, e and f). the egf receptor family-signaling
members analyzed did not correlate with the proliferative index.
egf receptor  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2186xxx  and antiegf receptor mab  xxxd467xxx  induce suppression of  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation at doses resulting in growth inhibition. to further define
the possible role of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 as a marker of egf receptor
activation and of the antiproliferative effects of egf receptor-targeted
therapies, a series of studies were performed in vitro. for these

studies, we used two human cell lines, a431 and difi, that have high
levels of egf receptor expression and that have been extensively
characterized by us and others (5, 6) to be egf receptor-dependent. in
these model cells, we analyzed the ability of the egf receptor tyrosine
kinase inhibitor  xxxd2186xxx  (7, 9) and of the chimeric anti-egf receptor
mab  xxxd467xxx  (5, 12) to inhibit autocrine growth and activation of
 xxxg1369xxx /2. to evaluate whether a correlation exists between concentrations of  xxxd2186xxx  or  xxxd467xxx  that inhibited growth and  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation, cell cultures driven by endogenous (autocrine) ligand were
incubated with increasing concentrations of each compound. for
western blot assays, cells were incubated in the presence of compound for 2 h and then lysed. for proliferation assays, cells were
incubated in the presence of compound for 72 h and then counted.
both  xxxd2186xxx  (fig. 3, a and b) and  xxxd467xxx  (fig. 3, c and d) inhibited
the growth of these cells at concentrations of drug that can be
achieved in patients. the effects on a431 cells and difi cells were
similar but not identical, because difi cells were more sensitive to the
growth inhibitory effects of the compounds analyzed and the degree
of inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation was greater in difi cells. regardless of this, the concentrations of  xxxd2186xxx  or  xxxd467xxx  that caused a

calculated from the percentage of the cell number in untreated cultures
of triplicate experiments (⫹se) for every treatment point. at every
treatment point, activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 (act- xxxg1369xxx /2) and total (phosphorylation state-independent)  xxxg1369xxx /2 were analyzed by western blot as
indicated in “materials and methods.”

decline in cell proliferation coincided with concentrations that reduced or abolished endogenous  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation in both cell lines,
as assayed by western blot with the activation state-specific antibody
(fig. 3). these effects on  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation were unrelated to downregulation of total (phosphorylation state-independent)  xxxg1369xxx /2 proteins, because their levels did not decrease by treatment (fig. 3).
differential cellular distribution of  xxxg1369xxx /2 as a function of
activation. we showed that egf receptor inhibitors markedly reduced  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation and that this effect was not attributable to
total  xxxg1369xxx /2 down-regulation (fig. 3). next, we studied in vitro
whether a differential cellular distribution of  xxxg1369xxx /2 exists as a
function of activation, as suggested from the observations in tumor
samples. a series of immunocytochemical analyses were performed
using the a431 (fig. 4a) and difi cells (fig. 4b) under the same
culture conditions used for the proliferation and western blot assays.
we used immunocytochemistry to provide subcellular localization of
total and activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 in situ. the cells were directly seeded in
immunocytochemistry slides placed on culture plates. this approach
avoids the steps of cell harvesting and centrifugation that would have
been needed if cells were grown directly in culture plates and that
might affect cell biology and morphology.
in cultures driven by endogenous (autocrine) ligand, both a431 and
difi cells exhibited nuclei staining for activated (phosphorylated)
 xxxg1369xxx /2 and for total (phosphorylation-independent)  xxxg1369xxx /2. staining for activated phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 was predominantly nuclear, suggesting that an important fraction of  xxxg1369xxx /2 is basally phosphorylated and localized in the nuclei. upon treatment with either  xxxd2186xxx 

or  xxxd467xxx , activated phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 staining markedly decreased and
total  xxxg1369xxx /2 staining shifted to a mainly cytoplasmic localization.
these results suggested that treatment with anti-egf receptor compounds prevents phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 and results in the presence of nonphosphorylated, mainly cytoplasmic  xxxg1369xxx /2. taken together, these data pointed out that the predominant cellular
distribution of  xxxg1369xxx /2 varies as a function of activation, mainly
nuclear for activated (phosphorylated) erk 1/2 and mainly cytoplasmic for nonphosphorylated  xxxg1369xxx /2.
the anti-egf receptor mab  xxxd467xxx  inhibits  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation and proliferation in patients. our observations in egf receptor model cell lines indicated a tight association between inhibition of
growth by anti-egf receptor compounds ( xxxd467xxx  and  xxxd2186xxx ) and
inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation, leading to the concept that activated
 xxxg1369xxx /2 might be a useful surrogate marker of activity of these
compounds. to assess whether an anti-egf receptor compound could
also reduce  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation in patients, we assayed activated
 xxxg1369xxx /2 in skin specimens from controls versus patients treated with
 xxxd467xxx . we chose to study skin because the basal layer of the epidermis
has high levels of egf receptor expression and the receptor plays a
critical role in the regulation of epidermal biology (23–27). furthermore,  xxxd467xxx  may cause skin acneiform rashes, suggesting that this skin
toxicity could be an indirect indicator of receptor targeting by  xxxd467xxx 
(12), and skin is easily accessible to biopsies.
we confirmed the expression of egf receptor in epidermal and hair
follicle keratinocytes in all of the control and experimental (from
patients treated with  xxxd467xxx ) skin specimens analyzed and found a

immunohistochemistry the expression of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 in 10
normal skin specimens using the same phospho-specific antibody to
 xxxg1369xxx /2 that we used for the studies performed in clinical head and
neck tumors and in tumor cells lines. in these control skin specimens
(i.e., from patients not treated with an egf receptor inhibitor), activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 was mostly expressed in the nuclei of keratinocytes of
the basal layer of the epidermis and in the outer root sheath of the hair

follicles (fig. 5, a and b), colocalizing with the population of proliferating, undifferentiated keratinocytes, where the egf receptor is
expressed at highest levels (ref. 27 and data not shown). the percentage of keratinocytes with nuclei staining to activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 was
scored in interfollicular epidermis in 10 high-power fields (⫻400).
hair follicles were qualitatively analyzed when present, but no scoring
was conducted because many samples lacked them. in these 10
control samples, the percentage of basal keratinocytes staining for
activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 was 25 ⫾ 7% (mean and sd).

fig. 6. expression of the ki67 proliferation markers in
paired pre- and on- xxxd467xxx  therapy skin biopsies. in normal
human skin, ki67 is expressed in interfollicular epidermis,
mainly in the basal layer (a), and hair follicle, mainly in outer
root sheath keratinocytes (b). during  xxxd467xxx  treatment, keratinocyte proliferation declined both in interfollicular epidermis (c) and in hair follicles (d; original magnification,
⫻400).

we then studied the expression of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 in skin biopsies from patients that were on treatment with  xxxd467xxx . in these patients,
the schedule of  xxxd467xxx  treatment consisted of a loading i.v.  xxxd467xxx  dose
of 400 mg/m2, followed by 250 mg/m2 i.v. weekly. we have shown
previously (12) that patients treated with  xxxd467xxx  at dose levels ⱖ200
mg/m2 achieve sustained serum antibody concentrations above 200
nmol/liter, a concentration high enough to result in optimal antitumor
activity in preclinical models. therefore, we should be able to demonstrate  xxxd467xxx  inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation in these treated patients
if the antibody inhibits egf receptor signaling in vivo. two patients
were on treatment with  xxxd467xxx , and radiation and skin biopsies were
taken from skin rashes that developed during therapy in nonirradiated
areas. the other two patients were on treatment with  xxxd467xxx  plus
cisplatin, and skin biopsies were taken from macroscopically normal
skin. in one of them, a baseline skin biopsy was also available.
overall, in the four on-therapy biopsies, there were low levels of
activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 expression in keratinocytes of the basal layer of the
epidermis (fig. 5c). the average percentage of positive basal keratinocytes from the four  xxxd467xxx -treated patients was 5 ⫾ 2% compared
with an average 25 ⫾ 7% positive basal keratinocytes from 10 control
specimens. there was also an evident reduction of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2
in the outer root sheath of the hair follicle, as compared with the
expression seen in control skin specimens (fig. 5d). in a patient that
underwent serial pre- and on-treatment skin biopsies, the expression
of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 was clearly reduced during  xxxd467xxx  treatment (i.e.,
20% pre- xxxd467xxx  versus 3% on- xxxd467xxx ; fig. 5).
on the basis of the correlation between  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation and
ki67 proliferation index in our series of head and neck tumors and on
the association between growth inhibition and inhibition of activated
 xxxg1369xxx /2 in egf receptor-dependent cell lines, we hypothesized that
the reduced levels of  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation observed in skin from patients treated with  xxxd467xxx  should be accompanied by a reduced proliferation rate. to study this possibility, we scored the percentage of

basal keratinocytes with ki67 staining in control versus  xxxd467xxx -treated
skin biopsies. the ki-67 staining colocalized with activated  xxxg1369xxx /2;
i.e., mainly in basal layers and in the outer root sheath (fig. 6, a and
b). we observed a reduced keratinocyte proliferation index in skin
biopsies taken during  xxxd467xxx  treatment [n ⫽ 4; ki67 proliferation
index, 7 ⫾ 4% (average and sd)] versus control specimens [n ⫽ 10;
ki67 proliferation index, 32 ⫾ 12% (average and sd); fig. 6c].
inhibition of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 was also seen in hair follicles (fig.
6d). in the patient that underwent serial pre- and on-treatment skin
biopsies, keratinocyte proliferation was also clearly reduced during
 xxxd467xxx  treatment (i.e., 25% pre- xxxd467xxx  versus 2% on- xxxd467xxx ; fig. 6). this
finding of a parallel effect of  xxxd467xxx  treatment in patients on  xxxg1369xxx /2
activation and on proliferation in a human egf receptor-dependent
tissue further supports the notion of a biological effect of  xxxd467xxx  on
receptor downstream processes in vivo.
overall, these findings indicate that egf receptor blockade inhibits
 xxxg1369xxx /2 activation and proliferation in patients in an egf receptordependent tissue and provides rationale for the use of activated
 xxxg1369xxx /2 in additional clinical studies with anti-egf receptor compounds as a surrogate marker of biological activity in tumor biopsies.
discussion
the goal of this study was to characterize in vivo the pattern of
expression of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 in head and neck tumors and its
relationship with expression of the upstream egf receptor, her2
receptor, and the ligand tgf-␣. we chose to study  xxxg1369xxx /2 because
of its critical role in the egf receptor downstream-signaling pathway
(2, 13), the known expression of total  xxxg1369xxx /2 in head and neck
tumors (33), and the availability of reagents to study their level of
activation in tumor samples at a cellular level. the levels of expression of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 correlated with a higher nodal state and a
higher proliferative rate and were increased in tumor relapses. we

activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 and egf receptor signaling in tumors

found that the levels of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 correlated with egf receptor, tgf-␣, and her2 expression. in addition, inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2
activation in egf receptor-dependent model cell lines with two different anti-egf receptor therapies correlated tightly with growth
inhibition, supporting its potential role as a surrogate marker in vivo
of egf receptor inhibition. we also showed that activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2
was lower in skin, an egf receptor-dependent tissue (23–27), from
patients treated with  xxxd467xxx  compared with control skin, and this
decrease in activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 was accompanied by a decrease in
keratinocyte proliferation.
in head and neck squamous carcinoma, overexpression of total
 xxxg1369xxx /2 had been observed (33), but the expression of the activated
forms, which are necessary for egf receptor-dependent signaling
processes, was yet uncharacterized. we now show in a series of 101
primary head and neck squamous carcinomas that activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 is
expressed in the nuclei of tumor cells in the majority of specimens, as
determined by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded specimens with an antibody that recognizes only the phosphorylated (activated)  xxxg1369xxx /2 (see “results” and ref. 22). this antibody allows the
assessment of the activation state of  xxxg1369xxx /2 in situ and provides
subcellular resolution of their nuclear translocation. we observed
higher levels of  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation in tumors from patients with more
advanced lymph node disease and in relapsed specimens compared
with their corresponding primary tumors. these findings indicate that
 xxxg1369xxx /2 are commonly activated in head and neck tumors and suggest
they have a role in their malignant progression.
in our series of head and neck tumors, the levels of activated
 xxxg1369xxx /2 were linked to the expression of egf receptor-signaling
members, further supporting that the ras-raf-mapk pathway is
activated by the egf receptor in vivo. increased levels of activated
 xxxg1369xxx /2 were significantly correlated with the expression of the egf
receptor and tgf-␣. in a multivariate analysis, tgf-␣, but not the
egf receptor, independently associated with  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation, suggesting that autocrine/paracrine stimulation of the egf receptor by
ligand may be required for  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation. perhaps, in head and
neck tumors the presence of tgf-␣ may be required in addition to the
almost universal expression of the egf receptor to activate the
receptor  xxxg2198xxx  activity and drive critical downstream events,
because it would be predicted from laboratory studies showing that
genetically induced overexpression of egf receptor ligands leads to
cell transformation in the presence of the receptor (3). taking into
consideration that  xxxg1369xxx /2 may be activated by several pathways, the
significant correlations observed between egf receptor (p ⫽ 0.037)
and tgf-␣ (p ⬍ 0.001) with activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 points to an important
role of the egf receptor in activating  xxxg1369xxx /2 in many head and neck
tumors. the correlation coefficients (r) were less than 0.5 (r ⫽ 0
would be lack of correlation; r ⫽ 1 would be an absolute correlation
in every single case), suggesting that  xxxg1369xxx /2 may also be activated
by other receptors or downstream molecules in certain head and neck
tumors. one example suggested in the present study was her2,
which in a multivariate analysis was associated with activated
 xxxg1369xxx /2 independently of the egf receptor and tgf-␣. in the case of
her2, as expected (31), the number of her2-overexpressing tumors
was low. however, in those tumors that overexpressed her2, a trend
to a positive correlation between her2 levels and  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation
was found. when included in a multivariate analysis, her2 was
independently correlated with activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2. this finding may
reflect that her2 receptor activation leads to  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation in
head and neck tumors or, alternatively, that her2 availability for
heterodimerization with egf receptor is rate-limiting for egf-mediated signal transduction and proliferation (34). however, the low rate
of her2 positivity detected in this series suggests that her2 may
play a role in a limited number of head and neck cancers. it is possible

that other receptors or ras mutations could lead to activation of
 xxxg1369xxx /2, because some specimens had high levels of activated
 xxxg1369xxx /2 without high levels of any of the egf receptor family
members analyzed. conversely, in some tumors with high levels of
one or more of the egf receptor family members analyzed, the level
of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 was low or even undetected. in such tumors, it is
possible that other egf receptor-signaling transduction pathways,
such as jak/stat or phosphatidyilinositol-3-kinase, are preferred
instead (2, 35).
a few studies have addressed the expression of activated mapk in
nonsquamous tumors and its potential clinical/biological correlations.
in prostate cancer, high levels of activated mapk were observed in
high-grade and advanced-stage tumors, suggesting elevated ras signaling in advanced disease (19). in glial tumors, the presence of
activated mapk was also reported, and among these tumors, oligodendrogliomas showed an increase in the number of cells with mapk
activation with malignant progression (20). in renal cell carcinoma,
mapk activation correlated with mapk kinase activation and  xxxg1924xxx 
activation (16). in hepatocarcinomas, a relationship was reported
between  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation and the transcription factor c-fos and
 xxxg366xxx  levels (17). in breast cancer, activated mapk was associated with poor prognosis and decreased sensitivity to endocrine therapy and with the expression of phosphorylated-jun, a transcription
factor activated by mapk (21). in this series of breast adenocarcinomas, activated mapk was correlated with the expression of egf
receptor, but not with tgf-␣, which adds support, in a different
histological tumor type, to our present finding of a link between
activation of mapk and egf receptor expression in clinical tumors.
in the present study, we also report a significant correlation between activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 and the proliferative index, assessed by using
ki-67 as a marker. it is likely, however, that other pathways, such as
the jak/stat or phosphatidyilinositol-3-kinase mentioned above (2,
35), also regulate proliferation in head and neck cancers. the pattern
of staining for activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 and ki-67 was predominantly at the
tumor edges, suggesting that the egf receptor may be predominantly
activated in these areas. preliminary experiments in a limited number
of specimens with an antibody to the activated form of the egf
receptor suggest this might be the case.8
additionally, our findings point to a potential role for activated
 xxxg1369xxx /2 as surrogate markers of egf receptor activity that may be
useful to characterize in vivo the optimal biological dose of anti-egf
receptor treatments. to give further support to this later proposal, we
studied in vitro the ability of the egf receptor  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2186xxx  (7) or the chimeric anti-egf receptor mab  xxxd467xxx  (5),
currently in clinical development (9 –11), to affect growth and
 xxxg1369xxx /2 activation in egf receptor-dependent model cell lines. the
results of these studies showed that the concentrations of  xxxd2186xxx  or
 xxxd467xxx  that inhibited proliferation driven by endogenous (autocrine)
ligand were the same that inhibited  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation. these effects
were seen at drug concentrations that can be achieved in patients and
that inhibit egf receptor phosphorylation in cultured cells (5, 7). a
greater inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation was seen in difi cells compared with a431 cells, which is in agreement with the requirement of
egf receptor activation for both cell cycle progression and prevention
of apoptosis in difi cells and a role of mapk in survival (13, 36). in
concordance with our findings, in tgf-␣/her2 bigenic mice treated
with the egf receptor  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor ag1478, regression of
mammary tumors was associated with abolishment of constitutive
mapk activity (37). we also analyzed in a series of immunocytochemistry assays the effects of  xxxd2186xxx  or  xxxd467xxx  on the cellular

distribution of total and activated  xxxg1369xxx /2. in both a431 and difi
cells, treatment with these anti-egf receptor compounds markedly
decreased activated (phosphorylated)  xxxg1369xxx /2 staining and shifted
total (phosphorylation-independent)  xxxg1369xxx /2 staining to a mainly cytoplasmic localization. these results suggested that treatment with
 xxxd2186xxx  or  xxxd467xxx  prevents phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 and results in
the presence of nonphosphorylated  xxxg1369xxx /2 localized mainly in the
cytoplasm.
we also studied whether an anti-egf receptor compound could
inhibit  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation in patients. this point was studied in a
series of skin specimens, because skin is a well-characterized egf
receptor-dependent tissue (23–27). these studies showed that in patients treated with  xxxd467xxx  (n ⫽ 4) there are markedly reduced levels of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 activation in skin compared with skin from control patients
(n ⫽ 10). low levels of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 in skin were seen in
patients treated with  xxxd467xxx  and radiation or  xxxd467xxx  and cisplatin. in a
patient that underwent sequential pre- and on- xxxd467xxx  skin biopsies, an
evident inhibition of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 was observed during therapy.
this decrease in activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 was accompanied by a decrease in
keratinocyte proliferation. this finding of a parallel effect of  xxxd467xxx 
treatment in patients on  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation and on proliferation in a
human egf receptor-dependent tissue further supports the notion of a
biological effect of  xxxd467xxx  on receptor downstream processes in vivo. in
a similar line of evidence, a preliminary analysis in skin biopsies from
patients treated with  xxxd2186xxx  showed a significant decline in the
expression of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 in keratinocytes during therapy (38).
we are extending these studies to a large set of skin biopsies from
patients participating in  xxxd2186xxx  phase i trials to correlate the degree
of  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibition with clinically meaningful end points. the next
challenge is to study activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 as a surrogate marker of egf
receptor inhibition in tumors from patients treated with anti-egf
receptor compounds. such studies are currently ongoing based on the
expression of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 from our current series and the
encouraging data obtained in nontumor skin biopsies post- xxxd467xxx  (current study) or post- xxxd2186xxx  therapy (38).
in summary, the data reported here show the presence of activated
 xxxg1369xxx /2 in most primary head and neck squamous carcinomas. elevated levels of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 were associated with advanced
lymph node metastasis and higher proliferation and were increased in
relapses, suggesting a role for activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 in the malignant
progression of these tumors. our work also indicates that egf receptor/tgf-␣ expression correlates with  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation in vivo.
furthermore, two different anti-egf receptor treatments inhibited
proliferation of egf receptor-dependent model cell lines at concentrations that inhibited  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation. we also found that activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 was lower in skin from patients treated with  xxxd467xxx 
compared with control skin, and this decrease in activated  xxxg1369xxx /2
was accompanied by a decrease in keratinocyte proliferation. as a
result, we are incorporating assessment of  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation levels in
pre- and post-therapy tumor biopsies from patients treated with the
anti-egf receptor  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2186xxx  or with the mab
 xxxd467xxx  to provide evidence for successful inhibition of egf receptor
function in vivo and to determine whether there is a correlation
between levels of activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 and response to therapy.
