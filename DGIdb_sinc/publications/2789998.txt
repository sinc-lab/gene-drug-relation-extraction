abstract: livers from male or female coturnix quail possess up to four electrophoretically distinct bands
of  xxxg110xxx  ( a d h ) activity. three  xxxd3045xxx -sensitive bands of enzymatic activity, designated
adh-1,  xxxg75xxx , and  xxxg76xxx , are cathodic at p  xxxd736xxx .2, and the fourth, adh-an, is neutral to slightly anodic
and insensitive to  xxxd3045xxx .  xxxg75xxx  and  xxxg76xxx , and occasionally adh-1, are present in livers from immature
females. t h e predominant enzyme in immature male livers is  xxxg76xxx . a t sexual maturity all three
 xxxd3045xxx -sensitive enzymes are present in livers from male birds, and livers from females possess predominantly
 xxxg76xxx . a d h - 2 and  xxxg76xxx , purified from female livers, are dimers of 80 000 daltons possessing 4 mol
of zn2+/mol of native protein. both  xxxg75xxx  and  xxxg76xxx  were inhibited by  xxxd2148xxx  with ki values
of 430 and 335 nm, respectively. these values are similar to those of human class i isoenzymes. neither
enzyme oxidized methanol or ethylene glycol, which distinguished them from mammalian  xxxd3045xxx -sensitive
a d h isoenzymes. both a d h - 2 and  xxxg76xxx  showed specificity toward hydrophobic primary alcohols and
were most active toward benzyl alcohol and n-octanol.

l i v e r alcohol dehydrogenases (adh,'  xxxg72xxx .1) have been
purified and characterized from many mammalian species,
including human (wagner et al., 1983, 1984; ditlow et al.,
1984), horse (lutstorf et al., 1970), rat (markovie et al., 1971),
and monkey (dafeldecker et al., 1981). all of these sources
have multiple isoenzymes of adh, which cumulatively act on
numerous physiologically important compounds such as precursors of norepinephrine, digitoxigenin, digoxigen, gitoxigenin,
and other steroids (frey & vallee, 1980; mardh et al., 1986),
and polyglycols (wagner et al., 1983). while these studies
have implicated metabolic roles for adh isoenzymes other
than ethanol detoxication, evidence does not exist to correlate
isoenzyme composition or specificity with any metabolic or
physiological state of the specimen.
avian alcohol dehydrogenases have not been as extensively
studied as the mammalian enzymes. previous work with
coturnix liver postulated the existence of one gene locus with
detection of three different alleles (castro-sierra & ohno,
1968). adh has also been isolated and partially characterized
from chicken livers (von bahr-lindstrom et al., 1978); however, little information is available concerning the properties
or substrate specificity of avian adh isoenzymes. we have
undertaken to characterize the alcohol dehydrogenases of quail
liver with respect to composition and occurrence as a function
of sex, age, and maturity of donors. we have also examined
the physical and enzymatic properties of two of the principal
forms of the enzymes.

purification of quail liver adh. livers from japanese
quail (coturnix coturnix japonica) were used for the purification and characterization of adh. birds used in these
experiments were from two different sources. for earlier work,
quail were hatched from eggs of the pharoah d-1 strain
purchased from fatima quail farms, artesia, ca (source l),
while for later work the quail were hatched from eggs obtained
from quail genetic stock center, university of british columbia, vancouver, bc, canada (source 2).
birds were anesthetized by exposure to a c 0 2 atmosphere,
decapitated, and bled. the livers were removed by dissection,
weighed, and immediately frozen on dry ice. all livers were
stored at -70 oc until use.
livers were thawed prior to use, rinsed to remove blood, and
homogenized at 4 oc, by using a sorvall omni-mixer, in 10
mm tris-hc1 buffer (1:2 w/v) containing 0.5 mm dtt, ph
8.0. unless otherwise noted, subsequent steps were performed
at 4 "c. the ph of the homogenate was then adjusted to 8.0
with 2.0 m  xxxd3449xxx  and stirred with a magnetic stirrer for
2 h. the homogenate was filtered through cheesecloth to
remove debris and lipid and then centrifuged at 27000g for
45 min.
the supernatant fluid was applied to deae-cellulose ( 100
ml of extract from 50 g of liver per 2.5 x 32 cm column),
equilibrated with 10 mm tris-hc1 buffer containing 0.5 mm
dtt, ph 8.0. after the sample was applied, the adh activity

was eluted with approximately 100 ml of the equilibrating
buffer, pooled, and concentrated to about 50 ml in an amicon
concentrator equipped with a um-50 membrane and operated
at 40 psi. the concentrated extract was dialyzed against 50
mm phosphate buffer, ph 7.5, containing 0.5 m m dtt.
after dialysis, the a d h sample was applied to an amphexane-agarose column preequilibrated with 50 m m sodium
phosphate and 0.5 m m dtt, p h 7.5. after the unbound
fraction eluted, which contained the majority of the protein
and no a d h activity, the column was washed with 50 m m
sodium phosphate containing 0.5 mm dtt, 0.2 m naci, and
20 mm galactose, ph 7.5, and then with the same buffer
containing 0.2 mm nad+ (1 column volume). adh activity
was eluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate containing 0.5 mm
dtt and 3.0 m m nad', ph 7.5, as an unresolved mixture
of two or three isoenzymes.
the mixture of a d h activities recovered from the amphexane-agarose column was further purified and resolved
according to a modified procedure of crabb et al. (1 983). the
mixture was dialyzed extensively against 5 mm hepes-naoh
buffer, ph 7.5, containing 0.5 m m dtt and 10 pm zinc
sulfate and then applied to cm-cellulose (2 x 7.5 cm column),
equilibrated with the same buffer. the conductivities of the
equilibrating buffer, the enzyme-containing solution, and the
effluent from the cm-cellulose column were measured prior
to chromatography to verify that they all were of the same
conductance. after contaminating protein was removed with
equilibrating buffer, the enzymes were resolved with a linear
gradient of 5-500 mm hepes buffer, ph 7.5, containing 0.5
mm dtt and 10 k m  xxxd3557xxx .
enzymatic assay.  xxxg110xxx  activity toward
alcohols and aldehydes was measured spectrophotometrically,
by using a cary 219 recording spectrophotometer, either as
the increase in absorbance at 340 nm due to the reduction of
nad' or as the decrease in absorbance a t 340 nm due to the
oxidation of nadh. when alcohols served as the substrate,
assays were performed a t 25 "c in 0.1 m glycine-naoh
buffer, ph 10, and 2.6 m m nad'. reactions were initiated
by the addition of enzyme. assays performed to monitor
elution from columns and to assess enzymatic activity were
performed with 33 mm ethanol. for all steps in the enzyme
preparation prior to chromatography on cm-cellulose, a blank
without ethanol was monitored for n a d h formation as a
control. enzymatic activity was calculated as the difference
between the velocities in the presence and absence of ethanol.
when octanal served as the substrate, assays were performed
a t 25 "c in 0.1 m mes-naoh buffer, ph 6.5, 0.26 mm
nadh, and 0.5 mm octanal. one unit of adh activity is
defined as the amount of enzyme required to catalyze the
reduction of 1 kmol of nad' or the oxidation of 1 pmol of
nadh/min at 25 "c, using a molar absorptivity of 6220 m-'
cm-] for nadh.
kinetic measurements were performed in a cary 219
spectrophotometer interfaced with an apple i1 computer. data
were collected and stored with software supplied by varian
associates and analyzed by a least squares fit to the michaelis
velocity equation.
protein determination. protein concentration was determined colorimetrically by the method of either lowry et al.
(1951) or bradford (1976). in both cases bovine  xxxg124xxx  was used as a standard. appropriate blanks were used
to correct for interference by buffers and dtt.
electrophoretic procedures. starch gel electrophoresis was
performed according to a modified method of bosron et al.
( 1 979). the gels ( 1 1 x 24.5 x 0.5 cm) contained 13% starch,

nussrallah et al.
1.0 mm nad', and 5.0 mm tris-hci buffer, ph 8.2.
samples were applied to paper wicks (0.5 x 1.0 cm) and
inserted into the gel a t the center of the slab. gels were run
at 720 v for 6 h at 4 "c. immediately after electrophoresis,
gels were sliced longitudinally into three slabs. the top slab
(ca. 1 mm) was discarded. the center and bottom slabs (1.5-2
mm in thickness) were stained for adh activity. the staining
solution (200 ml) contained 50 m m sodium pyrophosphate,
ph 8.5, either 100 mm ethanol or 100 mm pentanol, 0.6 mm
mtt,2 and 0.26 mm p m s 2 gel slabs were incubated in the
dark a t 40 "c for 15-20 min by submersion in the staining
solution. after being stained, the gels were washed with water
and photographed.
electrophoresis in nadods0,-polyacrylamide gels was
performed by the procedure of laemmli (1970), using a 5%
stacking gel and a 12% running gel. gels were stained with
coomassie blue and destained with methanol-glacial acetic
acid-water (4.5:1:4.5) or were silver stained by using a slightly
modified technique (morrissey, 198 1).
metal analysis. before the zinc content of purified quail
a d h was determined, the enzyme preparation was dialyzed
against 3000 volumes of 10 m m hepes buffer and 0.5 m m
dtt, ph 7.5, over a period of 24 h. all glassware was washed
with 20% nitric acid and then rinsed with glass-distilled water.
the zinc content was measured by using a graphite furnace
atomic absorption spectrophotometer. the analysis was
generously performed by s. h. wilkes, institute for occupational medicine, texas a & m university, college station,
t x 77843.
molecular weight and molar absorptiuity determinations.
the molecular weights of purified quail liver adh enzymes
were determined separately for each enzyme by the sedimentation equilibrium method of yphantis (1964). quail
adh enzymes (0.25 mg/ml) were dialyzed for 36 h against
50 mm phosphate buffer, ph 7.5, containing 0.2 m nacl and
then loaded into a double-sector cell. centrifuge measurements
were performed in a spinco model e analytical ultracentrifugation equipped with rayleigh interference optics. centrifugation was performed a t 22000 rpm a t 15 "c for 24 h,
when equilibrium had been achieved.
molar absorptivities were calculated after determination of
total nitrogen, using a modified micro-kjeldahl procedure of
ballentine (1957). the enzyme samples were desalted by using
a prepacked g-25 column (pd-10, pharmacia, inc., piscataway, nj) equilibrated with glass-distilled water. bovine serum
albumin was used for the standard curve. all samples and
standards were run in triplicate. prior to digestion, absorbances at 280 nm were determined by using a cary 219
spectrophotometer.
amino acid analysis. purified enzyme was desalted as
previously described and then lyophilized. approximately 5-10
pl of sample, diluted with water to a concentration of 1
mg/ml, or 5 pl of amino acid standards (standard h, pierce,
rockford, il) was placed in 6 x 50 mm pyrex tubes. tubes
containing samples and standards (performed in duplicate)
were placed in a vial fitted with a teflon valve, and then 350
pl of constant boiling hci was added to the bottom of each
vial. the vial was sealed under vacuum and subjected to
vapor-phase hydrolysis for 24, 48, and 72 h a t 110 "c according to the procedure of moore and stein (1963). after
hydrolysis, residual hc1 was removed under vacuum a t room
temperature. samples and standards were derivatized with
phenyl isothiocyanate, to form phenylthiocarbamyl amino
mtt and pms are carcinogens and should be handled with extreme
caution.

of waters associates inc., milford, ma, by using a waters
hplc system. an apple i1 computer was used with chromatochart (interactive microware inc., state college, pa)
to collect and process data. cysteine was determined as cysteic
acid by treating the enzyme with performic acid prior to hydrolysis as described by hirs (1967). tryptophan was estimated spectrophotometrically according to the method of
edelhoch (1967).

results
occurrence of adh enzymes in quail liver. starch gel
electrophoresis of liver homogenates (source 1) followed by
staining for adh activity revealed the existence of three
distinct cathodic bands of activity (figure 1).  xxxg76xxx , the
most cathodic of the bands, was present in the highest relative
activity in liver tissue;  xxxg75xxx , which was slightly less cathodic
than  xxxg76xxx , possessed a less intense activity. a third band
of activity, adh-1, was present in lower concentrations depending on the age and sex of the bird. the kinetic behavior
of this enzyme form was not investigated due to its low activity.
purification of  xxxg75xxx  and  xxxg76xxx  (table i) confirmed observations from gel electrophoresis and demonstrated  xxxg76xxx 
to be the enzyme form present in greatest concentrations in
livers from mature (16-week-old) females. livers from both
males and females contained a neutral to slightly anodic band
of enzymatic activity, designated adh-an, which was similar
to human x-adh. it was detected with ethanol (figure 1)
and preferentially with pentanol. it was not inhibited by
4mpz.
distinct differences between the male and female adh
electrophoretic patterns correlated with age (figure 1). at
2 weeks of age, the liver of male birds exhibited only one band
on starch gels, corresponding to  xxxg76xxx , while the liver of
female birds contained two electrophoretic bands,  xxxg75xxx  and
 xxxg76xxx . occasionally, trace amounts of adh-1 could be
detected in livers from young female birds. as the male birds
matured, the number of adh forms present in the liver increased to three distinct forms. in contrast, as the female birds
aged, the intensity of  xxxg75xxx  decreased relative to  xxxg76xxx .
livers from some female birds more than 1 year old possessed
only  xxxg76xxx  (data not shown). one form of the enzyme,
 xxxg76xxx , predominated and could be detected when the female
birds reached sexual maturity and were able to lay eggs.
purification of quail liver adh. the results of a typical
purification procedure for quail liver adh are presented in
table i. livers were obtained from 16-week-old birds (source
1). it was critical that all buffers used contained dtt, to
prevent inactivation of adh, presumably due to oxidation.
passage of the crude extract over deae-cellulose (equilibrated
in 50 mm tris-hc1 and 0.5 mm dtt, ph 8.0) resulted in
the removal of about 40% of the total protein in the crude
extract, while  xxxg75xxx  and  xxxg76xxx  appeared in the unbound
fraction. most of the loss in activity was accounted for by the

binding of the anodic adh to the resin.
all adh activity isolated from the deae step adhered to
amp-hexane-agarose. prior to the adsorbed enzyme eluting,
the column was extensively washed to remove any unbound
or weakly bound protein. after the unbound protein was
eluted, the column was washed with 50 mm sodium phosphate
containing 0.2 m nacl and 20 mm galactose, ph 7.5, to
disrupt nonspecific binding of proteins and glycoproteins to
the resin. the enzyme was eluted by complex formation with
nad'. a low concentration of the cofactor (0.2 mm nad')
was first used to remove other weakly bound pyridine nucleotide-dependent proteins. a small amount of adh coeluted
in this step, accounting for some decrease in the yield. the
bulk of adh activity was eluted with the addition of 3 mm
nad', along with some other proteins. starch gel electrophoresis revealed this fraction to possess  xxxg75xxx  and  xxxg76xxx 
and adh-1 when it was present in the crude material.
the three enzyme forms were separated and purified to
homogeneity on a cm-cellulose column (figure 2). these
enzymes were adsorbed at ph 7.5, while the contaminating
protein eluted in the unbound fraction. subsequently, the
enzymes were separated by using a linear gradient of hepes
buffer (5-100 mm).  xxxg75xxx  eluted prior to  xxxg76xxx , and the
specific activities of the isolated enzymes were 2.5 and 3.3
units/mg, respectively. when liver samples contained detectable levels of adh-l, it eluted prior to  xxxg75xxx , at approximately 25 mm hepes. the purified enzymes gave single
bands on sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis when stained
with coomassie blue (figure 3). starch gel electrophoresis
revealed a single band for each enzyme form when stained with
ethanol for activity (figure 4). notably, the numbers and
quantities of adh activities isolated by this procedure correlated well with electrophoresis results obtained by using liver
extracts.

molecular properties. nadods04-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis revealed the mobility of  xxxg75xxx  and  xxxg76xxx 
to be nearly identical with that of horse liver adh (figure
3), with apparent subunit masses of 42 000 daltons for both.
adh- 1 had an identical mobility on nadods04-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis when compared to  xxxg75xxx  and
 xxxg76xxx  (data not shown). native molecular weights were
calculated for each purified form of the enzyme from sedimentation equilibrium data. data for  xxxg76xxx  were collected
in duplicate and resulted in molecular weights of 82 700 and
82 800, very similar to the molecular weights of well-characterized mammalian adh isoenzymes. these data indicate
that quail liver  xxxg76xxx  is also a dimeric protein, composed

of two subunits of similar molecular weights. the sedimentation equilibrium of  xxxg75xxx  and adh-1 resulted in data that
indicated these enzymes had become partially dissociated,
presumably by the high salt concentration (0.2 m) used in the
buffer. a plot of the fringe displacement versus r2 was biphasic, one portion with a slope corresponding to the subunit
molecular weight and the other corresponding to the native
molecular weight.
samples of  xxxg75xxx  and  xxxg76xxx  were dialyzed against
metal-free buffers (holmquist, 1988) and then analyzed for
zinc by atomic absorption. metal analysis of  xxxg75xxx  and
 xxxg76xxx  showed a zinc content of 1.7-1.9 and 1.6-1.9 atoms/subunit, respectively, on the basis of  xxxg220xxx  molecular
weight of 42 000. molar absorptivities were determined by
micro-kjeldahl estimations of protein concentration. paucity
of pure  xxxg75xxx  and  xxxg76xxx  did not allow for multiple analysis
either of zn or of the molar absorptivities. thus, these results
only provide for a first approximation of the metal content,
which is in agreement with the well-established stoichiometry
for mammalian enzymes.
p h optima of catalysis. the rate of ethanol oxidation for
both  xxxg75xxx  and  xxxg76xxx  exhibited a ph maximum a t 11.o
(figure 5a). these enzymes were only about 30% as active
at ph 7.5. below ph 7.0 there was a rapid reversible decrease
in activity down to ph 4.5. in contrast, the rapid decrease
above ph 11.o reflected irreversible inactivation of the enzyme.
the rate of octanal reduction by  xxxg76xxx  was also studied
as a function of ph (figure 5b). this enzyme exhibited a
sharp ph maximum at ph 6.5. below ph 5.0 and above ph
8.0 the activity declined to zero.
kinetic analysis. kinetic results for the oxidation of some
alcohols by  xxxg75xxx  and  xxxg76xxx  are presented in tables i1 and
111, along with the kinetic values for nad' and nadh. both

forms proved to be specific for nad' as the cofactor in the
oxidation reaction inasmuch as neither  xxxg75xxx  nor  xxxg76xxx 
oxidized ethanol in the presence of nadp', up to a concentration of 15 mm nadp'. a ph value of 10.0 was selected
for these assays rather than ph 1 1.o, where optimal activity
occurs, to compare kinetic parameters with those obtained by
using mammalian adh isoenzymes.

0.192 mm for  xxxg76xxx  and  xxxg75xxx , respectively (tables i1
and 111). the k, for nadh, measured with 0.5 mm octanal
as the substrate, at ph 6.5, was found to be 5.13 w m for
 xxxg76xxx .
kinetic constants for a series of aliphatic alcohols were
determined for both enzymes by using saturating concentrations of coenzymes. because of the limited amount of  xxxg75xxx 
available, the investigation of its properties was not as extensive
as that of  xxxg76xxx . neither enzyme oxidized ethylene glycol
or methanol at concentrations up to 5 m, and of the alcohols
examined, both forms of the enzyme have the highest k,
values for ethanol. as can be seen from tables i1 and 111,
binding of alcohols to  xxxg76xxx  increases (evidenced by decreased k , values) with their hydrophobicity. values of k,,
were relatively constant and varied no more than 2-fold from
the mean of 224 min-', a value similar to those for human liver
isoenzymes (wagner et al., 1983).
with ethanol as the variable substrate, nad+ as the fixed,
saturating substrate, and 4mpz as an inhibitor, ki values of
430 and 335 nm were obtained for  xxxg75xxx  and  xxxg76xxx , respectively.
amino acid analysis. the results of the amino acid
analysis are presented in table iv. these data were calculated on the basis of  xxxg220xxx  molecular weight of 42000. the
overall composition was very similar to that of the residue
composition of human adh enzymes (hempel et al., 1984;
hoog et al. 1986, 1987; ikuta et al., 1986; von bahr-lindstrom
et al., 1986), with the exception of asx and methionine, the
latter of which was somewhat lower in the quail enzymes. both
forms of the quail enzyme are rich in glycine, alanine, valine,
and lysine residues, typical of all mammalian adh enzymes.
 xxxg75xxx  contains 8 residues of half-cystine, while the halfcystine content for  xxxg76xxx  was found to be 12 residues. the
low half-cystine value for  xxxg75xxx  was consistent in three
separate preparations of these isoenzymes.
values for asx for both  xxxg75xxx  and  xxxg76xxx  were almost
half those for class i or class i1 human isoenzymes (table iv).
glx values for human and quail liver enzymes were similar,
however.

discussion
electrophoretically, three cathodic bands of adh activity
constitute the majority of the detectable ethanol oxidizing
activity in coturnix quail liver. additionally, slightly anodic
adh activity is easily detected when pentanol is used as the
test substrate and is barely perceptible when ethanol is the
substrate. this enzymatic form, which was not further
characterized, correlates with x-adh from human liver
(wagner et al., 1984).
quail liver adh enzymes have been reported to be derived
from three autosomally inherited alleles, designated a, b, and
c (castro-sierra & ohno, 1968). thus, a liver could possess
a single homozygous phenotype or three phenotypes derived
from heterozygous gene, namely, a/b, b/c, or a/c. in the
present study, livers from a common population were pooled
for adh isolation. under these circumstances, one might
expect to observe a very complex electrophoretic pattern of
up to six bands. we consistently observed just three bands
of activity in preparations from two different sources. this
could mean that one allele was missing from these populations
or that these alleles are behaving as homodimeric electromorphs of this genetic locus (batzer et al., 1988). since we
could not directly relate our observations with the allelic
phenotypes reported by castro-sierra and ohno (1968), we
have used the designations adh-1,  xxxg75xxx , and  xxxg76xxx ,
which indicates the order of electrophoretic separation of
coturnix quail liver adh activity but does not imply any
genetic relation between them. however, we do not yet know
whether these forms are all homodimeric or if one represents
a heterodimer. preliminary evidence indicates that  xxxg76xxx 
is h~modimeric.~
the most cationic form,  xxxg76xxx , appeared to be predominant in all pooled liver extracts subjected to electrophoresis
regardless of sex or age; however, the relative amounts of the

three cathodic forms of adh varied with age and sex. extracts of pooled livers from young female birds from ages 2
weeks to 8 weeks possessed all three of the adh activities,
but as females matured and began laying, first adh-1 and
later  xxxg75xxx  disappeared, leaving  xxxg76xxx  as the predominant
and often the only detectable adh enzyme form. in pooled
liver extracts from males the reverse was true: young males
had predominantly  xxxg76xxx  and developed adh-1 and  xxxg75xxx 
as they matured. in both males and females the changing
adh pattern correlated well with the onset of sexual maturity
and, in females, with egg production.
the cathodic adh activities from female quail liver, like
those from mammalian livers (pietruszko, 1975), were inhibited by 4mpz. thus, procedures developed for the purification of adh isoenzymes from mammalian tissues (wagner
et a]., 1983) were adapted for use. unfortunately, affinity
chromatography on capgapp (employed for the purification
of human liver cathodic isoenzymes) (lange & vallee, 1976)
could not be employed. quail a d h enzymes had to be kept
in millimolar concentrations of dtt to maintain activity.
under these conditions the enzymes did not adhere to capgapp. others have shown that dtt interferes with capgapp
affinity chromatography of adh isoenzymes (hoshino et a].,
1985). affinity chromatography on amp-hexane-agarose
provided the purification of adh enzymes from other proteins
as an unresolved mixture. chromatography on cm-cellulose
afforded subsequent separation of the three adh activities.
on the basis of specific activity measurements (table i) adh
constitutes 0.75% of liver weight in 16-week-old female birds,
about one-third that for the human isoenzymes (ditlow et al.,
1984).
physical properties of quail adh enzymes are markedly
similar to those of mammalian enzymes (wagner et al., 1983,
1984; ditlow et al., 1984); they are dimers of 80 000 daltons
composed of subunits of 40000 daltons and possess 4 mol of
zn/mol of native protein. the amino acid compositions of
 xxxg75xxx  and  xxxg76xxx  were markedly similar to those of mammalian cathodic adh isoenzymes (jornvall & markovic,
1972; hempel et al., 1984, hoog et al., 1986, 1987; ikuta et
al., 1986; von bahr-lindstrom et al., 1986), with the exception
of their methionine content, which was half that of the human
isoenzymes. further,  xxxg75xxx  had two-thirds the half-cystine
content (8 residues) of  xxxg76xxx  (12 residues), the latter of
which compared favorably with that of human isoenzymes.
oxidation of simple alcohols occurred optimally a t ph 1 1,
and reduction of simple aldehydes occurred optimally a t ph
6.5. these optima are characteristic of virtually all mammalian alcohol dehydrogenases.
specificity of the quail adh enzymes for the oxidation of
alcohols revealed apparent differences between these enzymes
and those isolated from mammalian sources. human liver
adh isoenzymes are subdividied into classes on the basis of
their sensitivity to inhibition of ethanol oxidation by 4mpz,
electrophoretic mobility, and substrate specificity (strydom
& vallee, 1982). thus, class i isoenzymes (a) are the most
cathodic, (b) are strongly inhibited by 4mpz, and (c) oxidize
methanol, ethanol, and a host of other primary aliphatic and
aromatic alcohols. class 11 adh isoenzymes are less cathodic
than class i isoenzymes, are not effectively inhibited by 4mpz,
and oxidize ethanol, but neither methanol nor ethylene glycol.
class i1 human adh isoenzymes oxidize other primary alcohols with a specificity similar to that of class i . class i11
isoenzymes are anodic, are not inhibited by 4mpz, and oxidize
neither methanol nor ethylene glycol. they do oxidize ethanol,
but cannot be saturated by this substrate at concentrations as

nussrallah et al.
high as 2.5 m (wagner et al., 1984). livers from other
mammalian sources, including horse (lutstorf et al., 1970),
mouse (holmes et al., 1981), and monkey (dafeldecker et al.,
198l ) , all possess cathodic,  xxxd3045xxx -sensitive enzymes that
oxidize methanol and ethylene glycol as well as ethanol and
other aromatic and aliphatic primary alcohols. livers from
monkeys have been shown to possess  xxxd3045xxx -insensitive adh
isoenzymes that oxidize neither methanol nor ethylene glycol,
but are active toward ethanol (dafeldecker et al., 1981), and
therefore resemble human class i1 adh isoenzymes. thus,
it appears that activity toward methanol and ethylene glycol
is an enzymatic characteristic of mammalian  xxxd3045xxx -sensitive
a d h isoenzymes.
the enzymes isolated in this study,  xxxg75xxx  and  xxxg76xxx ,
have characteristics consistent with class i human isoenzymes.
first, like class i human isoenzymes, both  xxxg75xxx  and  xxxg76xxx 
are cathodic and inhibited by 4mpz (ki = 430 nm for  xxxg75xxx 
and 335 n m for  xxxg76xxx , a t p h 10). the human isoenzyme
pi has a ki for 4mpz 290 n m a t ph 10; the ki decreases to
a minimum of 44 nm at ph 8.5.4 thus, the 4mpz inhibition
of  xxxg75xxx  and  xxxg76xxx  is of the same level of magnitude as
that of human 0,. the k,,, values for  xxxg75xxx  and  xxxg76xxx 
toward ethanol are more similar to those of class i human
isoenzymes (1-2 mm; wagner et al., 1983) than to class i1
( k , = 20 mm for class it; ditlow et al., 1984). neither
 xxxg75xxx  nor  xxxg76xxx  is capable of oxidizing methanol or
ethylene glycol, but their pronounced inhibition by 4mpz
clearly characterizes them as class i "like"  xxxg110xxx  enzymes.  xxxg76xxx  has highest specificity for
benzyl alcohol and 1-octanol, demonstrating a selectivity for
hydrophobic alcohols. it has been previously reported (levine
& haley, 1975) that embryonic quail liver adh was active
toward aliphatic alcohols up to eight carbons. methanol and
1- xxxd3026xxx  were reported to be poor substrates. a determination of k , for ethanol was also made for an extract of
embryonic chicken liver containing two a d h isoenzymes
(wilson et al., 1984). these workers found the k , to vary
from 1 to 5 mm, depending on the age of embryonic development. this variation may be a reflection of isoenzyme
composition in their preparation.
like mammalian liver a d h isoenzymes, k,,, values are
relatively constant at ph 10, consistent with the mechanism
established for horse liver a d h in which ethanol oxidation
is limited by dissociation of n a d h from the adh-nadh
complex (brooks & shore, 1971).
while the methodology used in this investigation did yield
two highly purified forms of a d h from quail liver, we have
concentrated our efforts on the  xxxg76xxx  enzyme from female
livers. w e do not know if the three cathodic adh enzymes
in male livers are the same as adh-1,  xxxg75xxx , and  xxxg76xxx .
our interest in  xxxg76xxx  stems from the fact that it was the only
form of the enzyme present in fully mature female livers and
predominant in livers from younger laying females. since it
was the most predominant, it was obtained in greatest quantity.
the correlation of the change in patterns of enzyme activity
with the onset of maturity and egg production suggests the
possibility that  xxxg76xxx  may be involved in the metabolism of
metabolically functional complex alcohols. whether this
changing pattern is unique to birds is not certain. however,
corresponding changes have not been reported for mammalian
species. if correlation of the state of liver metabolism to the
identity of adh present is significant, then clearly,  xxxg76xxx
