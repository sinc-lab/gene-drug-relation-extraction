 xxxd1747xxx , the first vasopressin receptor antagonist approved by the fda, is
available for the treatment of hyponatremia in euvolemic and hypervolemic
patients. the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is activated in heart
failure (hf) causing clinical worsening.  xxxd3495xxx  levels are also
elevated in hf.  xxxd1747xxx  is an effective and fda approved for the treatment
of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia and may offer an extra treatment option in hf by targeting v1a and v2 receptors. in this article we review
the physiology, preclinical studies as well as the human clinical studies on the
use of  xxxd1747xxx  and its potential and promise in the treatment of hf.

background

 xxxd1747xxx , the first vasopressin receptor antagonist approved by the fda, is
available for the treatment of hyponatremia in euvolemic and hypervolemic
patients. it is effective in causing aquaresis and may offer an extra treatment option
in heart failure (hf).

introduction

heart failure incidence has not declined over the past 20 years. it accounts for >
1 million hospital admissions in a year and there are ∼ 5.7 million hf patients in
the us. the estimated direct and indirect cost of hf for 2009 is $ 37.2 billion [1].
despite advances in pharmacotherapy, the readmission rate for patients with acute
hf at 6-month following discharge approaches ∼ 50% with an estimated 5-year
mortality of 50%. the overall death rate in hf has not improved significantly [1].
novel therapeutic agents are hence needed to improve outcomes in hf.
sodium and volume homeostasis are important in the pathogenesis and clinical
consequences of hf. hyponatremia defined as a serum sodium (s.na) < 130 meq/l
was found in 5% of patients with hf in the adhere registry [2]. hyponatremia
defined as a s.na < 138 meq/l was found in 38% of the 992 subjects, with new york
heart association (nyha) class ii – iv hf, enrolled in the muerte subita en
insuficiencia cardiaca study (figure 1) [3]. in a retrospective study of 2,624 patients
presenting with hf, as part of the enhanced feedback for effective cardiac treatment (effect) study, hyponatremia (s.na < 136 meq/l) was found to be a
strong predictor of mortality at 30 days and at 1 year [4]. analysis of data from
the optimize-hf registry pointed out that s.na < 135 meq/l on admission was
associated with higher in-hospital mortality. however, low admission s.na
remained a significant predictor of mortality and rehospitalization at 60 and
90-days post-discharge [5]. in addition the hospital length of stay was also found
to be significantly increased in patients admitted with congestive hf who also
had concomitant hyponatremia [5,6]. neurohormonal activation is the primary
determinant for sodium and volume homeostasis. the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone

 xxxd1747xxx 

the first avp receptor antagonist approved by the fda is
 xxxd1747xxx  hydrochloride ( xxxd1747xxx ).  xxxd1747xxx  hydrochloride is chemically [1,1′-biphenyl]-2-carboxamide, n-[4-[(4,5dihydro-2-methylimidazo[4,5-d][1]benzazepin-6(1h)-yl)
carbonyl]phenyl]-, monohydrochloride, having a molecular
weight of 535.04 and the molecular formula c32h26n4o2•hcl.
 xxxd1747xxx  is a nonpeptide, dual antagonist of avp v1a and
v2 receptors (box 1).
the pharmacologic effects of  xxxd1747xxx  are primarily mediated by v2-receptor antagonism in renal collecting duct cells,
which blocks water reabsorption by these cells. as a result, it
produces aquaresis or the electrolyte sparing excretion of water.
 xxxd1747xxx  has been approved by the fda for treatment
of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia, and is not yet
approved for primary treatment in hf.

pathogenesis of hyponatremia in heart  
failure

disorders of sodium are indicative of an imbalance in the total
sodium content to the total body water content. hypernatremia
is usually indicative of hypertonicity while hyponatremia can
occur in low, normal and high tonicity states. hyponatremia
can generally be classified into depletional or dilutional causes.
depletional hyponatremia occurs in conditions in which the
total body sodium is reduced relative to the total body water
content. here the total body water content is reduced but the
total sodium content is reduced to a much higher extent. this
can occur with renal losses as occurs with diuretic use, salt
wasting nephropathies and mineralocorticoid deficiency or
extra-renal losses as in diarrhea and burns. dilutional hyponatremia occurs when the total body sodium is low, normal or
may even be increased, but the total body water is increased to
a much higher extent.
body fluid volume is regulated by several neurohormonal
mechanisms of which the raas and the avp pathways are
important. both these hormonal cascades are deranged in
hf. in the normal person, increase in sodium and total
body water results in an increase in excretion of sodium and
water. in hf, whether it is due to low cardiac output as in
cardiomyopathy or due to high cardiac output states as in
anemia or beriberi, there is a decrease in the ‘effective’ circulating volume [7]. this decrease in the effective circulating
volume decreases stretch on various mechano-receptors in
the vascular system including the left ventricle, carotid sinus,
aortic arch and the afferent renal arterioles. this leads to
activation of the sympathetic nervous system, raas and the
release of avp [7].

activation of the sympathetic nervous system results in
increased peripheral vascular resistance, myocardial contractility and heart rate. the long-standing increase in circulating catecholamines causes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and,
later on, increased apoptosis [8]. increase in circulating catecholamines also causes renal vasoconstriction and activation
of the raas [7].
activation of the raas results in sodium retention with
secondary water reabsorption. in a normal person, sodium
and, therefore, water retention stops once 1.5 – 2.0 l of
water is retained by the body. volume expansion subsequently
leads to diuresis and natriuresis, and, thereby, reestablishes the
balance. this is termed as the ‘mineralocorticoid escape’ phenomenon. in hf, this escape phenomenon is defective due to
 xxxg99xxx  and sympathetic nervous system stimulation,
resulting in continued fluid and sodium retention [9,10].
neuroendocrine activation, as reflected by elevated plasma
norepinephrine, renin, atrial natriuretic factor and vasopressin, plays the central role in hf disease progression [11]. beta
blockers have been proven to be effective in hf by blocking
the adverse effects of sympathetic nervous system stimulation [12-14]. aldosterone antagonists, ace inhibitors and
angiotensin receptor blockers have been shown to improve
mortality in hf [9,10,15-22]. hence, it is only natural that
investigators have thought of graduating to the next potential
therapeutic target of vasopressin receptors in hf.
5.

physiology of  xxxd3495xxx 

vasopressin is a neurohormone released by the posterior
pituitary. its release is primarily dependent on the plasma
tonicity, blood pressure and plasma volume. decrease in
blood pressure and plasma volume act through arterial
baroreceptors, while osmoreceptors in the anterior hypothalamus respond to decreased tonicity resulting in increased
secretion of vasopressin.
there are three receptors for avp (table 1). the v1b
receptors are located in the anterior pituitary, pancreas and
adrenal medulla. the v1a receptors are located in the vascular
smooth muscle and cardiac myocyte. these are gpcrs and
activation of these receptors results in increased vascular
smooth muscle tone. this increased vascular tone may contribute to worsening of hf. animal studies with infusion of
supraphysiologic concentrations of vasopressin have shown
negative inotropic effect on the heart primarily due to
vasopressin-mediated coronary vasoconstriction. however,
physiologic levels of vasopressin have shown positive inotropy
probably due to stimulation of v1a receptors in the heart.

in hf, mean values of avp are higher than in the general
population. in addition, the osmotic release of avp also shows
exaggerated response [23]. in fact, avp levels are increased in

patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction before
fully manifested hf syndrome. despite lower plasma osmolality and serum sodium levels, avp levels are higher in hf
patients compared to normal people. also, decrease in plasma
osmolality does not decrease avp levels appropriately in these
patients. clearly this autoregulatory mechanism is deranged in
the syndrome of hf. vasopressin-mediated vasoconstriction
does not cause an appreciable increase in blood pressure in
normal subjects [24]. in hf patients infusion of vasopressin
results in increase in the systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures while the stroke volume and
cardiac output decrease [24]. these adverse hemodynamic
effects of avp in hf are thought to be mediated through v1a
receptors. sustained stimulation of v1a receptors in the heart
can lead to remodeling and further deterioration of myocardial
function. the v2 receptors are found on the renal collecting
ducts. these receptors act via an adenylate cyclase dependant
mechanism. stimulation of these receptors result in an increased
production and subsequent incorporation of aquaporin 2 water
channels on the luminal cell surface. this result in increased
water retention and in hf and contributes to the development
of hyponatremia (figure 2).
2164

in animal models, exposure to avp resulted in myocyte
hypertrophy that improved with avp receptor antagonists [25,26]. increased avp levels acting through v2 receptors
also worsen hyponatremia.  xxxd1747xxx , by its dual v1a and
 xxxg231xxx  blocking actions, should reverse and prevent
these adverse effects.
7.

pharmacology and pharmacokinetics

 xxxd1747xxx  acts on both v1a and v2 vasopressin receptors.
through its  xxxg229xxx  blocking action  xxxd1747xxx  counteracts the increase in blood pressure due to avp. the main action
of  xxxd1747xxx  is through its  xxxg231xxx  antagonism, by which
it decreases delivery of aquaporin 2 channels to the collecting
tubular cell surface. this results in increased free water excretion without the loss of sodium. diuretics in general cause a
loss of sodium and may further worsen hyponatremia.
oral  xxxd1747xxx , in studies, has shown a 44% bioavailability and is not clinically available. throughout the concentration range of 10 – 1,000 ng/ml,  xxxd1747xxx  is 99%
bound to plasma proteins. approximately 83% of the
 xxxd1747xxx  is excreted in the feces and 12% in the urine

over several days. following an intravenous dose, ∼ 1% is
eliminated intact in the urine over the first 24 h. metabolism of  xxxd1747xxx  is mediated by the cyp isoenzyme 3a4.
 xxxd1747xxx  is a sensitive substrate and potent inhibitor of
cyp3a4. four metabolites of  xxxd1747xxx  have been identified. the contribution of these metabolites to the clinical
effects is minimal, inasmuch as the combined exposure
to them after intravenous administration is only 7% of that
of  xxxd1747xxx . the pharmacologic activity at v1a receptors
and v2 receptors ranged from ∼ 3 – 50% to 50 – 100%,
respectively. after a single administration of  xxxd1747xxx 
50 mg i.v. or 60 mg p.o. in six healthy volunteers, there was
a significant increase in urine flow rate and a significant
decrease in urine osmolality with the peak effect at 2 h and
return to baseline at 12 h. fluid balance was negative for
the first 6 h. after 12 h the fluid balance became positive.
 xxxd3495xxx  levels and plasma osmolality were
increased significantly for the first 6 h after administration
of the drug whether intravenously or orally [27].
in an open-label safety and efficacy study of  xxxd1747xxx 
in patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia,
patients received a 20-mg i.v. loading dose of  xxxd1747xxx 
followed by a continuous infusion of 20 or 40 mg/day for
4 days. the median  xxxd1747xxx  plasma concentration at the
end of the infusion (96 h) was 117.6 ng/ml after the

20-mg dose and 215.7 ng/ml after the 40-mg dose. the
median  xxxd1747xxx  elimination half-life was 5.3 and 8.1 h
after the 20 and 40-mg doses, respectively, and the median
 xxxd1747xxx  clearance was 16.1 l/h after the 20-mg dose and
8.73 after the 40-mg dose.
8.

adverse effects and drug interactions

 xxxd1747xxx  has been generally well tolerated in clinical trials.
the most common limiting adverse effect in clinical trials
has been local injection site reactions. this has been reported
in 52.5% of patients. headache and thirst were the next
common adverse reactions reported.
because  xxxd1747xxx  is a sensitive substrate and potent
inhibitor of the cyp3a4 isoenzyme, the coadministration of
 xxxd1747xxx  with potent cyp3a4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir and indinavir,
is contraindicated.
the auc for midazolam, simvastatin, digoxin and amlodipine is increased during coadministration with  xxxd1747xxx 
and should be avoided if possible. the effect of hepatic
impairment on the elimination of intravenous  xxxd1747xxx 
has not been systematically evaluated. increased systemic
exposure after administration of oral  xxxd1747xxx  (up to a
mean 2.8-fold increase) has been seen in patients with stable

cirrhosis and moderate hepatic impairment. therefore,
 xxxd1747xxx  should be administered with caution to patients
with impaired hepatic function.
the effect of renal impairment on the elimination of
 xxxd1747xxx  after intravenous administration has also not
been evaluated. following administration of oral  xxxd1747xxx ,
the auc was 80% higher in patients with renal impairment
(creatinine clearance < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) than in those
with normal renal function. intravenous  xxxd1747xxx  resulted
in higher  xxxd1747xxx  exposure than did oral  xxxd1747xxx  in
study subjects without renal function impairment.
caution should be exercised when administering  xxxd1747xxx 
to patients with impaired renal function.
9.

indications, dosing and administration

 xxxd1747xxx  is indicated for the treatment of euvolemic and
hypervolemic hyponatremia. at this time,  xxxd1747xxx  has
not been approved by the fda for treatment of hf with
the qualification that it can be used for the treatment of
hypervolemic hyponatremia and hf only if the benefit of
increased s.na outweighs the risk of adverse effects.
 xxxd1747xxx  is approved for use in hospitalized patients
only with an initial loading dose of 20 mg i.v. over 30 min
followed by 20 mg continuous infusion over the next 24 h.
it is to be administered for a further 1 – 3 days by continuous infusion of 20 mg/day. if the s.na is not rising at
the desired rate, the dosage may be titrated upward to
40 mg/day administered in a continuous intravenous infusion. total duration of  xxxd1747xxx  infusion after the loading
dose should not exceed 4 days; the maximum dose (after
loading dose) is 40 mg/day.
in addition to the initially introduced 5 ml vial formulation,  xxxd1747xxx  is also currently available as a premixed,
ready-to-use 5% dextrose solution (20 mg of  xxxd1747xxx  in
100 ml of 5% dextrose). since it is ready to use and does
not require dilution or mixing before infusion, the risk of
contamination or infection is low. the new premixed
formulation is expected to cause less vascular irritation.
10.

clinical experience

10.1

hyponatremia

in a double-blind placebo controlled study of 84 hospitalized
patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia
(s.na 115 – 130 meq/l) who were randomized to receive
intravenous placebo or  xxxd1747xxx  administered as a 30-min
20-mg loading dose followed by a 96-h infusion of either
40 or 80 mg/day i.v., the s.na level increase associated with
placebo was 0.8 ± 0.8 meq/l while that with  xxxd1747xxx 
40 mg/day was 6.3 ± 0.7 meq/l and with 80 mg/day was
9.4 ± 0.8 meq/l. the drug was well tolerated except for
infusion site reactions prompting discontinuation in 1 patient
in the 40 mg/day group and 4 patients in the 80 mg/day
group. the increase in s.na was due to an increase in free
2166

water excretion as evidenced by an increase in calculated
‘effective water clearance’, which is a measure of electrolyte
free water excretion [28]. another retrospective study done on
22 patients treated with  xxxd1747xxx  for euvolemic hyponatremia showed an average time to reach a goal of ≥ 6 meq/l
increase in s.na level to be 13.1 h [29]. no firm guideline on
the use of  xxxd1747xxx  in hyponatremia has been established
as yet [30].  xxxd1747xxx  is contraindicated in hypovolemic
hyponatremia as it could further worsen the volume status of
the patient [30]. rapid correction of hyponatremia can lead to
myelinolysis including ‘central pontine myelinolysis’ leading
to quadriplegia. this has not been observed as a problem in
clinical studies of  xxxd1747xxx , which could be because of the
modest rate of rise in s.na with  xxxd1747xxx  or due to intense
monitoring in the clinical trial setting.
10.2

heart failure

even though the use of  xxxd1747xxx  has not been approved
in the treatment of hf, pathophysiologically it provides an
exciting choice as an extra pharmacologic option for the
treatment of hf. as noted earlier, avp levels have been
shown to be elevated and are important in the pathogenesis
of hf. the typical management of acute decompensated hf
involves the use of diuretics that may cause or worsen
hyponatremia and may contribute to adverse outcome.
 xxxd1747xxx , being an aquaretic, presents an attractive choice.
a study done on 142 patients with symptomatic hf (nyha
class iii and iv) who were randomized to single dose of
 xxxd1747xxx  (10, 20 or 40 mg i.v.) or placebo showed that
there was a significant reduction of right atrial pressure and
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in the  xxxd1747xxx  group
compared to placebo. of note, the changes in cardiac index,
systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, blood pressure
and heart rate did not differ significantly in the  xxxd1747xxx 
treated group compared to placebo [31]. the authors concluded that treatment with  xxxd1747xxx  resulted in favorable
changes in hemodynamic parameters and urine output
without affecting blood pressure or heart rate.
in a double-blind, placebo controlled trial of intravenous
 xxxd1747xxx  (20-mg loading dose followed by continuous
infusion of 40, 80 or 120 mg/day for 2 days) in 162 patients
with decompensated hf,  xxxd1747xxx  resulted in increase in
urine volume as well as decrease in body weight without any
overall improvement in clinical status [32]. in another multicenter, placebo controlled, double-blind study of oral
 xxxd1747xxx  (10, 20 or 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.) in 343 patients
with stable chronic hf, no improvement in overall functional capacity, exercise tolerance or quality of life was noted
in the  xxxd1747xxx  treated group compared to placebo [33].

of the neurohormonal systems.
falling s.na in the presence of hf is now accepted as a
surrogate of poor prognosis. hyponatremia is a marker of
advanced hf with an overactive raas. various inhibitors
of this axis such as beta blockers, ace inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists and, more
recently, direct renin inhibitors have shown favorable outcomes when used in these patients. however, most of these
agents have proven to change the outcome when used on a
long-term basis in patients with nyha class ii – iv hf.
despite advances in neurohormonal antagonist therapies,
hf patients continue to progress through the downhill
spiral to the more advanced stages of the disease.
 xxxd1747xxx , the novel combined v1a and  xxxg231xxx 
antagonist, has been generally well tolerated in clinical trials.
the most common limiting adverse effect in clinical trials
has been local injection site reactions. this has been reported
in 52.5% of patients. however, a premixed bag formulation
that is postulated to have a lower incidence of infusion site
reactions is now available. headache and thirst were the
next common adverse reactions reported.

coadministration of drugs such as ketoconazole, which is a
potent inhibitor of cyp3a4 isoenzyme, will increase the
level of  xxxd1747xxx . coadministration of substrates of
cyp3a4 isoenzyme, especially cardiac medications such as
simvastatin, amlodipine and digoxin, can increase their drug
levels in serum. hence, further studies where concomitant use
of these medications is routine might help alleviate concerns
and appropriate dosing strategies.
there have not been large-scale randomized studies evaluating the interaction between  xxxd1747xxx  and routine hf
medications such as ace inhibitors, beta blockers, natriuretic peptides and so on. additionally, no studies have
compared effectiveness and toxicity of this class against other
therapeutic approaches in hyponatremia, such as severe water

restriction, diuretics, salt supplementation, urea and demeclocycline. furthermore, studies done in patients with hf
have generally used higher doses of 40 and 80 mg/day compared to the approved dosing of 20 mg/day [32]. future
phase iii and iv studies are needed to ascertain dosing,
especially in this sicker group of patients.
most trials with novel therapeutic agents acting similarly
have not shown much promise in terms of outcomes when
used in acute decompensated hf. although low s.na is
associated with poor outcome and direct organic changes in
the nervous system, it may merely be a marker of very
advanced hf, where more aggressive therapy may be warranted to treat the primary disorder (advanced hf). a paradigm shift is needed in thinking that ‘although agents like
 xxxd1747xxx  may treat the falling serum sodium, it may just
be a cosmetic therapy’. such thinking has resulted in the use
of this important agent only when there is severe hyponatremia. moreover, since milder degrees of hyponatremia
(s.na 132 – 135 meq/l) have been shown to have a worse
30-day and 1-year mortality (odds ratio 1.69 and 1.6), more
studies are needed to explore the safety and efficacy of this
agent in the syndrome of acute decompensated hf. what is
needed is evidence of its efficacy in patients who have activated raas, where we know that the avp levels are also
elevated and may be causative in worsening and progression
of the hf syndrome. it is in these patients that an agent
with properties like  xxxd1747xxx  may cause favorable hemodynamics as well as aquaresis (diuresis without sodium loss),
reducing the need for diuretics, which are known to worsen
renal dysfunction, increase sympathetic activation and reduce
s.na levels further.
