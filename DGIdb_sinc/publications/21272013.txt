the monoaminergic neuron, in particular the dopaminergic neuron, is central to mediating the hedonic and addictive
properties of drugs of abuse. the effects of amphetamine (amph) and cocaine (coc), for example, depend on the
ability to increase dopamine in the synapse, by effects on either the plasma membrane transporter dat or the vesicular
transporter for monoamine storage, vmat2. the potential role of dat as a target for amph and coc has been
reviewed extensively. here, we present vmat2 as a target that enables the rewarding and addictive actions of these
drugs, based on imaging, neurochemical, biochemical, cell biological, genetic, and immunohistochemical evidence.
the presence of vmat2 in noradrenergic, serotoninergic, histaminergic, and potentially trace aminergic neurons
invites consideration of a wider role for aminergic neurotransmission in amph and coc abuse and addiction.

introduction
in 1962, kirshner showed that reserpine and
various so-called “indirectly acting sympathomimetic amines” (drugs like amphetamine
[amph], phenylephrine, and ephedrine with
norepinephrine-like pharmacological effects, but
without action on adrenergic receptors) could block
14
c-epinephrine uptake into a particulate fraction
from bovine adrenal medulla (the secretory granule). these experiments established the first molecular link between monoamine uptake into storage
vesicles and psychotropic drug action.1 the study
of monoamine uptake into storage granules was
followed by an extensive characterization of the
remarkable amine-accumulating properties of the
vesicular  xxxg2099xxx  by the laboratories of scarpa, johnson, henry, schuldiner, and others, showing that the 10,000-fold accumulation was
due to an atp-driven proton gradient, and subsequent proton-monoamine exchange via transport
facilitation2–6 (fig. 1). subsequently, the laboratories of eiden and colleagues and edwards et al.

cloned the rodent and human monoamine transporters  xxxg2098xxx  and vmat2,7–9 the former found
mainly in peripheral neuroendocrine cells and absent from all areas of the central nervous system,
and the latter in monoaminergic neurons of the
central and peripheral sympathetic nervous systems.10,11  xxxg2098xxx  and vmat2 are members of the
solute carrier superfamily and carry the designations
 xxxg2098xxx  ( xxxg2098xxx ) and  xxxg2099xxx  (vmat2) within
that family.4 fundamental insight into  xxxg2099xxx  function can be gained by appreciation of its placement
within a superfamily of proteins called texans, for
toxin-extruding antiporters.5,12 the vesicular neurotransmitter transporters evolved from bacterial
antiporters that exchanged (extruded) cellular toxins in exchange for extracellular protons at the cellular membrane. their role in vesicular transport
represents essentially an “internalization and delayed extrusion” strategy for export of transmitter
molecules (by exocytosis) that are in fact toxins (e.g.,
dopamine) if allowed to accumulate in the neuronal
cytoplasm rather than being sequestered in storage
vesicles.13–15

vmat2 and addiction

drug-taking behavior and the maintenance of drugseeking behavior? finally, what possibilities might
exist for vmat2 as a target for treatment of addiction? these are the subjects of this review.

more recently, vmat2 knockout mice have established the critical role of vmat2 both in maintaining catecholamine and serotonin levels in cns,
and monoamine availability for exocytotic release
from neurons upon depolarization.14,16,17 in the
past several years, human variants in  xxxg2098xxx  have
been linked to susceptibility for schizophrenia18
and bipolar depression19 and those in vmat2 to
schizophrenia20 and protection from alcohol neurotoxicity.21 since available evidence (vide supra)
strongly supports the proposition that vmat2 is the
only vesicular  xxxg2099xxx  expressed
in cns neurons, this review will focus on it; the
general cellular biology and physiology of  xxxg2098xxx 
and vmat2 together have been reviewed elsewhere.3,22–28
visualization of vmat2 binding sites in the brain
reveals a target highly susceptible to altered ligand binding (for example, of the [11 c]-labeled pet
ligand dihydrotetrabenazine, dtbz) as a function
of intracellular amine concentration, and a transporter protein whose expression is far more dynamically regulated by physiological and pharmacological conditions (e.g., stress and drug abuse)
than previously appreciated. how have advances
in understanding the biochemistry and cell biology of monoamine storage enabled insights into
vmat2 as a target for drugs of abuse? what are
the potential roles of vmat2 in the molecular and
cellular mechanisms underlying the rewarding of

in this section, we review the fundamental neuroscience of the vmats, with primary emphasis on vmat2. this is because although  xxxg2098xxx 
and vmat2 are co-expressed in human adrenal
medulla, and thus might both play a role in peripheral adrenaline release by drugs of abuse, the central and peripheral nervous systems of rodents, primates, and humans appear to express only vmat2.
hansson et al. have reported  xxxg2098xxx  mrna expression during development within the sensory nervous system of the rodent.29 however, other studies
have failed to substantiate this finding at either the
mrna or protein levels,30,31 and cns nerve terminals of vmat2 knockout mice show a complete abolition of reserpine-sensitive monoamine uptake.16
lohoff et al. have also reported that  xxxg2098xxx  is
present in human brain tissue, and that  xxxg2098xxx 
protein is expressed in neuronal terminals in the
hippocampus, striatum, and cortex. our laboratories and others have been unable to obtain evidence for  xxxg2098xxx  expression in neurons of adult
rodent or primate brain,32 or in the developing rodent (rat) nervous system,30,31 in contrast to the
reports cited above. for the purposes of this review,
we assume, according to our own published and recently reexamined data (see fig. 2), that  xxxg2098xxx  is
not expressed at appreciable levels in the brain of
adult rodents or humans, the mammalian species
in which most data relevant to drug addiction have
been obtained. in view of the reported concordance
between inheritance of nondominant  xxxg2098xxx  alleles and prevalence of schizophrenia and affective
disorders in certain european populations,18,19,33,34
however, the issue of expression of  xxxg2098xxx  in human brain should probably be systematically reexamined.

chemical neuroanatomy of
vmat2-expressing central neurons
vmat2 is expressed in all monoaminergic neurons
of the brain, including those expressing dopamine
(da), serotonin (5-ht), norepinephrine (ne),
epinephrine (epi), and histamine (his). it is likely

that vmat2 is also the vesicular transporter for
neurons synthesizing and storing the so-called trace
amines for which cognate receptors have now been
identified, including those for tyramine (tyr) and
phenylethylamine (pea).35 both tyr and pea have
affinity for vmat2 comparable to that of da and
ne.32 vmat2 immunohistochemistry allowed the
categorization of aminergic neurons in the brain,
both during development and in mature mammals,
into those that were fully functional for aminergic
neurotransmission (e.g., expression of biosynthetic
enzymes, vmat2, and the serotoninergic plasma
membrane transporter  xxxg2150xxx  for 5-ht; of biosynthetic enzymes and co-factors, vmat2, and the
dopamine plasma membrane transporter dat for
da; biosynthetic enzymes and co-factors, vmat2,
and the norepinephrine plasma membrane transporter net for ne) and those that might participate in functional neuronal circuitry in other
ways. for example, neurons of the primate nucleus
tractus solitarius express  xxxg2276xxx  (th)
for dopa synthesis, but lack  xxxg618xxx 
( xxxg618xxx ) for da synthesis and have been termed
“dopaergic” neurons.36 these neurons have no
detectable vmat2 protein, suggesting that neurons unable to produce exocytotically relevant mes-

88

sengers also downregulate or extinguish vmat2
expression. vmat2 can also play a significant negative regulatory role in chemical coding of neurotransmission. for example, sweat gland innervation
in the mouse is cholinergic but not functionally
monoaminergic due to the selective lack of expression of vmat2 in these particular postganglionic
sympathetic neurons, despite their expression of
both th and  xxxg608xxx  (dbh)
(ref. 37, but see also ref. 38). in human sweat
glands, both cholinergic and noradrenergic functionality is maintained through full expression of the
proteins, including vmat2 and the vesicular acetylcholine transporter vacht, for both phenotypes.37
the dynamic regulation of vmat2 expression
both in development and upon acute and chronic
drug exposure may provide a new dimension in
characterizing the cell biological process that occurs
during the transition from recreational to compulsive drug use in addiction. chronic drug use, for
example, is already known to produce impairments
in monoaminergic circuits in the cns that include
neurotoxicity, and enhanced sensitivity of receptor signaling.39–43 with continued drug use, homeostatic mechanisms can be activated in response
to increasingly depleted monoamine stores within

specific mesolimbic pathways, an aspect of drug addiction in which vmat2 is likely to play a central
role.
intriguingly, vmat2 is expressed transiently in
thalamocortical sensory circuits during development, in neurons that otherwise express no biosynthetic enzymes for biogenic amines.31,44 these neurons also express  xxxg2150xxx , and have been postulated
to scavenge 5-ht from neighboring neurons to create de novo “serotonergic” neurons during cns development in rodents.44 whether such neurons exist
in human brain, and might be operative in mediating developmental effects of perinatal exposure to
drugs of abuse,45 remains an unanswered question.
vmat2 is the cns vesicular transporter for not
only the biogenic amines da, ne, epi, 5-ht, and
his, but likely also for the trace amines tyr,
pea, and thyronamine (thyr). tyramine neurons are found in drosophila where they are essential for sensitization to coc.46 tyraminergic neurons in mammalian cns would be identifiable as
neurons expressing vmat2 for storage, and the
biosynthetic enzyme aromatic amino acid decarboxylase ( xxxg618xxx ).47 thus neurons identified without th, but with  xxxg618xxx  and vmat2, are not
only potentially “monoenzymatic neurons” (after
the nomenclature of ugrumov48 ) but also potentially trace amine neurons as well. these would
be affected by amph and, depending on the presence of postsynaptic trace amine-associated receptors (taars)35,49 and trace amine reuptake transporters (i.e., dat, net, or  xxxg2150xxx ), by coc as well.

substrate specificity of vmat2
the substrate and inhibitor specificity of vmat2
for various psychostimulants and/or neurotoxic
drugs of abuse was examined by erickson et al.
for human vmat2 in an heterologous-cell 5-ht
uptake assay.32 the affinity for vmat2 of damphetamine, racemic mdma, fenfluramine, and
1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (mpp+) was 2, 7, 5,
and 9 um (compared to 1.4 and 0.9, respectively, for
dopamine and 5-ht itself). thus, these compounds
interact with vmat2 with an apparent affinity similar to that of dopamine, the major neurotransmitter
implicated in addiction in the cns.41 data for coc
interaction with human vmat2 are not available.
however, measurement of vmat2 interaction
with addictive psychotropic agents in comparison
with the manifest abilities of such agents to alter

vmat2 and addiction

vmat2 expression in vivo after chronic or acute
administration could shed light on whether such
compounds trigger addiction and/or hedonic
reward through direct, or indirect interaction with
vmat2-expressing neuronal circuits in vivo.
the drug specificity of the plasma membrane
transporters dat, net and  xxxg2150xxx  have been investigated quite extensively. in contrast, there is no
pharmacological specificity expected at the level of
vesicular uptake of da, ne and 5-ht since all
are mediated by vmat2. however, there are distinct differences in da, ne, and 5-ht metabolism
and depletion in dat as well as vmat2 knockout mice (see below), suggesting that both chronic
and acute effects of agents acting at vmat2 might
well have dramatically different impacts on synaptic transmission in different neurotransmitter systems. there has been little examination of the combinatorial effects of, for example amph, coc or
mdma (or even antidepressant net- and 5-httspecific uptake inhibitors) on the dat/vmat2,
net/vmat2, or  xxxg2150xxx /vmat2 neuronal uptake
and retention systems upon chronic treatment.
however, gaintedinov and caron have pointed out
that although da depletion induced by chronic
amph or coc has “as a rule”50 been interpreted
as being due to outright nerve terminal destruction, there is in fact little evidence for this. vesicular
amine depletion of intact nerve terminals, through
interactions between drug, dat and vmat2, may
actually represent a more relevant feature of the process by which individuals become addicted to these
compounds, in which case, intervention at the level
of vesicular uptake could be envisaged.51,52
does the substrate specificity of vmat2, and its
role in transmitter uptake of amines besides those
mentioned above, play any additional roles in the
central neurochemistry of substance abuse and addiction? duerr et al. have hypothesized that the evolution of a  xxxg2099xxx  isoform lacking the ability to
store histamine ( xxxg2098xxx ) may have afforded a selective advantage to organisms whose gut enteric
nervous system is supplied with serotonin largely
from enterochromaffin cells of the gut, which scavenge serotonin from dietary sources and release it
presumably to be taken up by “faux-serotonergic”
vmat2-expressing neurons lacking tryptophan hydroxylase for de novo 5-ht synthesis.53 the presence of vmat2 in mast cells of the central nervous system, in transient transmitter-unidentified

somatosensory relay neurons in thalamus, and in
histaminergic neurons of the hypothalamus,31 and
the pharmacological ability of amph and related
compounds to release his from storage vesicles
based on the relative affinity of amph and his for
vmat2, suggest that his-releasing action of addictive amine-releasing drugs should not be overlooked.

vmat2-regulation of trafficking and
transporter activity
a conceptual block to focusing on vesicular transporters as potential regulators of dynamic aspects
of synaptic transmission in general has been the
understandably ingrained notion that the size of
the secretory quantum is fixed and unregulated.
this view informs much of the copious research
on synaptic plasticity, which has focused, through
most of the last 40 years, on mechanisms involving
changes in efficiency of presynaptic release, rather
than changes in the secretory quantum. synaptic
efficacy is thought to be the cellular substrate for
learning and memory including learning associated with addiction.41 however, only recently have
activity-dependent changes in synaptic efficacy been
sought and found in changes of synaptic scaling involving altered vesicular (quantal) content.54 the
view that neurotransmitter quantal content might
be a dynamically regulated physiological process was
suggested by experiments in which vesicular transporters, such as the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (vacht) were altered in vivo to affect quantal size.55 it was further demonstrated that the ratio
of expression of vacht to the biosynthetic enzyme
for acetylcholine, chat, was significantly different
in central and peripheral neurons,56 suggesting that
biosynthesis and vesicle filling, along with quantal
release probability, could regulate the architecture
of neurotransmission. in parallel developments in
gabaergic and glutamatergic systems, several laboratories found evidence that vesicular filling may be
controlled, in addition to the limits set by electrochemical driving forces generated by the vesicular
vacuolar h+-generating atpase (fig. 1), by accessory proteins that act as quantal size regulators. the
ueda laboratory has identified a fodrin-derived inhibitory protein factor (ipf) that when injected into
synaptosomes, decreases quantal size for serotonin,
gaba, and glutamate.57,58 no endogenous protein
regulator for  xxxg2099xxx  has been identified. however,

90

the thyroxine metabolite thyr is a potent inhibitor
of monoamine uptake by vmat2, and has been proposed as an endogenous inhibitor of monoamine
uptake and storage in the brain.59
a second potentially important mode of regulation of vmat2 activity, and thus of vesicular filling
and regulation of quantal size, has been identified
by ahnert-hilger and colleagues in a series of papers that describe linkage between g-protein expression and vesicular filling by vmat2.  xxxg2098xxx  or
vmat2 expression in cho cells allowed uptake of
tritiated serotonin. this uptake, modulated by previous store filling with unlabeled biogenic amine,
was shown to be dependent on the first intraluminal
loop of  xxxg2099xxx .60 although the relationship between
the biogenic amine and  xxxg2099xxx  employed ( xxxg2098xxx 
versus vmat2) is complex, it appears to require
g-proteins (go in platelets and gi in other cell
types) and the calcium-activated protein for secretion (caps).61 these intriguing results, collectively,
imply an intravesicular monoamine- xxxg2099xxx  interaction, via a  xxxg1027xxx , that provides a
mechanism for modulation of vesicular filling below
the set point determined by the vesicular electrochemical gradient. this mechanism may be related
to the abolition of cocaine (coc)-induced behavioral sensitization in go2alpha-knockout mice.62
completion of crucial details of this mechanism for
regulation of  xxxg2099xxx  transport activity, including
the pathway through which intravesicular amines
might affect extravesicular g-protein modulation
of vmat2, should be informative for gaining insight into how coc, meth, amph, and perhaps
therapeutic agents such as antidepressants, affect
neuronal signaling for vesicle filling.
signaling pathway modulation by addictive drugs
may also affect vmat2 transporter function indirectly, but profoundly, by altering  xxxg2099xxx  cellular
trafficking. vmat2 trafficking to ssvs in preference to large dense core vesicles (ldcvs) occurs, at
least in pc12 cells, under conditions in which pka
signaling is reduced.63
the relationships between  xxxg2099xxx  phosphorylation, g-protein-dependent alterations in vesicle filling, transporter trafficking, and camp/pka signaling are not yet resolved into a coherent picture of
signal transduction modulating vesicle filling and
quantal size. the effects of addictive drugs on this
process, and its role if any in addiction itself, appear to be promising leads in addiction research.

figure 3. cellular aspects of vmat2 trafficking, expression,
and targeting by drugs of abuse. dual site of action of amph at
the synaptic vesicle and at dat, and single site of action of coc
at dat, are depicted. vmat2 trafficking to ssvs and ldcvs
is regulated in part by phosphorylation, and vmat2 transport
by g- protein coupling, through signal transduction pathways
that are not yet characterized.  xxxd3330xxx  binds directly to vmat2
independently of its cellular location. see text for details.

these ideas have already led to the proposal that
compounds targeting vmat2, such as lobaline, may
be useful in the treatment of methamphetamine addiction by blocking its amine-releasing actions in
vivo.64,65 it is especially promising that the effects
of addictive drugs on each step of the process of
exocytosis, from vesicle filling to neurotransmitter
release during synaptic transmission, can be modeled in detail in chromaffin cells and studied in vivo
using cyclic voltammetry.66,67 details of the cellular
biology of vmat2 relevant to both drug action and
clinical neuroimaging are shown in figure 3.
genetics of vmat2

vmat2 knockouts—clues to vmat2 brain
functions
in 1997, three groups independently reported the
generation of knockout mice deficient in vmat2
expression.14,16,17 several aspects of vmat2
function in brain were immediately confirmed.
complete knockout (−/−) of vmat2 expression
is lethal at birth, and accompanied by lack of
feeding behavior, and can be partially rescued by
administration of amphetamine.16 this suggests
that while activity-dependent (vesicular) secretion
of a monoamine, centrally or in the periphery, is
essential for life, it can be mimicked sufficiently for

vmat2 and addiction

survival by indirect release via plasma membrane
transporter-dependent efflux. since the restored
phenotype appears to be enhanced motor activity
allowing feeding, it is most likely dopaminedependent. knockout of vmat2, with preservation
of  xxxg2098xxx , reduced total labeled monoamine
accumulation in whole brain vesicular membrane
preparations to levels found after reserpine administration.16 this finding provides further functional
evidence that, at least in mouse brain, no additional
vesicular transporter, such as  xxxg2098xxx , plays a
discernable functional role in vesicular monoamine
accumulation. finally, monoamine (5-ht, da, and
ne) levels are profoundly reduced in vmat2 (−/−)
newborn mice (less than 2% of wild-type) indicating that vesicular storage of monoamines is essential
not only for activity-dependent release, but also for
biasing the relative rates of synthesis and degradation of monoamines (da, ne, and 5-ht metabolite
levels are as high in knockout as in wild-type brain)
in favor of monoamine accumulation, and thus
increasing monoamine biosynthetic efficiency.16
interestingly, vmat2 heterozygous (+/−) mice
also demonstrate about a 50% loss of endogenous
da and 5-ht (though not ne), indicating that
gene dosage is critical for vmat2 function in vivo.
these results also offer indirect support for the idea
that regulation of vmat2 activity and/or expression could be a rate-limiting step in monoamine
production and release by controlling quantal size
in monoaminergic neurons. this notion has been
tested directly by pothos and colleagues by overexpression of vmat2 in neuroendocrine cell models,
in which quantal size is indeed a direct function of
vesicular vmat2 density.68 the vmat2 heterozygous knockout phenotype has also allowed direct
confirmation that vesicular transport, especially in
dopaminergic neurons, plays an important role in
sequestration of potential neurotoxins like mpp+,
as well as the endogenous neurotoxin da.14,26 these
results have direct implications for neurodegeneration and parkinson-like clinical outcomes associated
with environmental exposure to neurotoxins, as well
as long-term drug abuse. finally, altered sensitivity
to the locomotor effects of coc, amph, and alcohol in vmat2-deficient mice provide evidence
that the effects of drugs of abuse depend directly
on ambient amine storage levels, which in turn are
set, within fairly tightly constrained boundaries, by
expression of vmat2.14

vmat2 and addiction

a point worth considering in somewhat greater
detail is the altered sensitivity to drugs of abuse conferred in vmat2-deficient mice, alluded to in the
preceding paragraph. uhl and colleagues have reported that vmat2 heterozygous mice displayed
both sensitization to amph-induced locomotion,
and decreased amph-induced reward.14,69 the authors concluded that synaptic vesicle function may
contribute more to amph-induced reward than to
locomotion, consistent with an independent report
of rescue of the vmat2 null phenotype from lethality at birth by administration of amph, largely
restoring locomotor activity required for feeding
and survival.16 the implications of this work have
been particularly exciting as they not only highlight the possibility that addiction as well as relapse liability may be controllable at the level of
the amine storage vesicle,52,64,65 but also provide
animal models for testing both potential treatments
and hypotheses about processive, long-term neurochemical mechanisms of addiction and addictive
behavior.

human  xxxg2099xxx  genetics and epigenetics
and addiction
the primary importance of vmat2 in monoamine
storage and release in the central nervous system
provided a strong rationale for examination of single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in both coding and noncoding regions of vmat2 that might
be linked to psychiatric and neurological diseases in
which monoamines are implicated. these include
parkinson’s disease, drug addiction, environmental
neurotoxin-mediated neurodegeneration, depression, bipolar disease, and schizophrenia. heritability is taken as strong evidence for a uni- or oligogenic component of disease, while concordance
in identical twins is taken as strong evidence for
a genetic component (and may be the only genetic evidence for a multigenic genetic component)
for a disease. finally, association between gene alleles and disease phenotypes or behavioral traits
can be identified in case-control studies. the evidence for vmat2 “defining haplotypes” in various monoamine-associated human diseases, and for
vmat2 haplotypes potentially contributory to addiction or response to addictive drugs in particular,
can be considered in this context.
evidence for vmat2 as a genetic component in
affective disorders is, as for many genetic mark-

92

ers for schizophrenia, mixed. thus, uhl and coworkers essentially ruled out vmat2 allelic variants
as genetic contributors to schizophrenia risk,70 while
chu and co-workers using a genomic gene–function
approach identify vmat2 as one of nine genes
demonstrating a gene–function correlation in
schizophrenia.20 an unexpected correlation has
been uncovered between ethanol consumption in
male mice and vmat2 expression, with higher
spontaneous ethanol consumption in vmat2
(+/−) compared to wild-type mice at high ethanol–
water ratios,71 while vmat2-deficient mice show a
decreased ethanol preference in a two-bottle preference test.72 this correlation is made more intriguing by the subsequent identification of an hvmat2
snp cluster, or defining haplotype, that defines a
reduced risk for alcoholism.21 uncovering the neurochemical phenotype of the haplotype will be an
important step forward in understanding what aspect of vmat2 function confers susceptibility to
alcohol addiction. whether this can be generalized
to addiction to substances other than ethanol is of
course an even more exciting avenue for continued
investigation.
finally, it should be noted that the work of
barr and colleagues demonstrating modulation of
vmat2 expression during the development of
corticosterone-dependent aversion learning in infant rats73 suggests that stable changes in vmat2
gene expression may be acquired not only genetically, but also epigenetically. however, alterations in
vmat2 expression during the acquisition of addictive behaviors mediated by altered dna methylation
or histone acetylation at this locus have not yet been
reported in the literature.

chemical characteristics of vmat2 ligands
the most-used ligand for vmat2 binding studies in vivo is [11 c]-labeled dihydrotetrabenazine
(dtbz) (fig. 4). originally of therapeutic interest
due to its antipsychotic properties,  xxxd3330xxx 
( xxxd3330xxx ) is a benzoquinolizine derivative that is marketed under the trade name  xxxd3330xxx  for treatment of hyperkinetic disorders including chorea associated with huntington’s disease, and tourette’s
syndrome,74,75 because of its dopamine-depleting
properties. dtbz is its reduced-ketone congener,
with decreased chemical reactivity but similar

vmat2 binding characteristics. the affinity of  xxxd3330xxx 
for vmat2 is about 0.09 ␮m, i.e., about 10 times
higher than that of da, and about 10 times less
than that for reserpine (res), as measured under
initial-velocity uptake conditions.32 the slow offrate of res from vmat2 makes the latter a quasiirreversible ligand compared to  xxxd3330xxx . it should be
noted that the affinities of  xxxd3330xxx , ne, da, and 5-ht
for rat and human vmat2a are essentially identical,9 making in vivo imaging studies with dtbz
in rodents pharmacologically quite comparable to
results expected in imaging of human subjects.
since  xxxd3330xxx  does not bind to hvmat1, while it has
a high affinity for hvmat2,32 analysis of chimeric
 xxxg2098xxx /2 constructs enabled thiriot and ruoho
to localize  xxxd3330xxx  binding to the tenth transmembrane domain of vmat2, in a region likely to represent part of the vesicle-facing binding site for catecholamines.76 this implies that  xxxd3330xxx  has a high
affinity for vmat2 relative to da because the internal site has a lower affinity than the externally
facing size for transported catecholamines.5,12 thus,
 xxxd3330xxx  as an in vivo ligand could well be sensitive to
the relative state of depletion of the dopaminergic vesicle during in vivo conditions (e.g., chronic
amph usage) in which vesicular da depletion is
likely.

vmat2 and addiction

clinical (rodent and primate) and clinical positron
emission tomography (pet) studies with the goal
of imaging monoaminergic nerve terminals in the
brain. initially, the rationale for the use of dtbz,
like that of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter
ligand vesamicol, was that vmat2 was unregulated by drugs, and would therefore function as a
marker for synaptic integrity during in vivo imaging of progressive neurodegeneration in neurological diseases such as parkinson’s disease, huntington’s chorea, and alzheimer’s disease.77 however,
striatal vmat2 is decreased not only in advanced
parkinson’s disease,78 but further in patients shortly
after administration of levodopa.79 it is also elevated in chronic methamphetamine users shortly
after cessation of drug use.80 these findings strongly
implied that altered pet signals after dtbz administration might arise not only as a function of
vmat2 concentration in brain tissue, but also as a
function of endogenous da competition with the
tracer ligand during imaging. to test this hypothesis, boileau et al. used human subjects to measure striatal [11 c]-dtbz binding after an acute oral
dose of amph. they found a slight decrease in
binding, a fact these authors attributed to insufficiency of amph dosing to significantly deplete
striatal da in their subjects.81 kilbourn et al. conducted a more systematic study in rat, in which
in vivo pet analysis of [11 c]-dtbz binding was
examined as a function of da depletion with
 xxxd2634xxx  and repletion with ldopa. these authors concluded that pet-visualized
dtbz binding site density could be altered in
vivo as a function of endogenous da concentrations independently of the actual protein concentration of vmat2.82 contribution of mast cell
vmat283,84 to pet signals derived from [11 c]dtbz binding must also be considered in brain,31
as well as tonsils85 and other tissues. thus, the picture of precisely what neurochemical information
vmat2 imaging with dtbz provides is still somewhat unfocused. altered [11 c]-dtbz may reflect
changes in endogenous catecholamine levels with
unchanged vmat2 protein expression, or altered
vmat2 protein expression or trafficking. more
systematic preclinical studies will be required to
optimally guide the extraction of clinically useful
information from [11 c]-dtbz imaging of the human brain.

vmat2 and addiction

eiden & weihe

physiological and pathophysiological
plasticity of vmat2 expression
as mentioned above, using  xxxd3330xxx  as a marker
for occupancy of brain vmat2 binding sites
is confounded by two often-opposing effects of
chronic drug use. changes in the ambient levels of
endogenous transmitters or drugs at time of imaging cause changes in competitive inhibition of  xxxd3330xxx 
binding during the imaging event. changes in the
actual number of vmat2 molecules expressed in
brain tissues also alter  xxxd3330xxx  binding. can these two
variously additive and opposing effects be distinguished to allow mechanistic insight into drug addiction from descriptive studies of dtbz binding
in vivo? knowledge of the relative affinities of endogenous transmitters, drugs of abuse, and imaging
ligands in vitro, while invaluable, are insufficient for
this purpose, since the concentrations of competing
ligands in vivo are rarely known, and the amount of
vmat2 protein per unit brain tissue cannot be assumed to be constant across individuals in different
experimental groups. rigorous preclinical studies
are still too few to resolve this issue (vide supra), and
provide a solid basis for interpretation of the existing clinical studies already reported. nevertheless,
some principles are emerging from this work that
allow the tentative conclusion that vmat2 protein
expression is dynamically regulated as a function of
drug administration.

drug administration modulates vmat2 activity
it was initially thought that dat was highly regulated by neuronal trafficking and signaling pathways, which are sensitive to perturbation by drugs
such as coc and amph, as well as some antidepressants86 and, conversely, vmat2 expression and
transport activity were relatively unregulated and
unperturbed by drug treatment. for example, profound depletion of brain monoamines with reserpine depresses  xxxd3330xxx  binding because reserpine binds
irreversibly to the same site that  xxxd3330xxx  occupies reversibly, albeit with high affinity.87 however, this
treatment has no effect on striatal vmat2 protein levels, as measured by quantitative immunohistochemistry with vmat2 antibodies whose binding is unaffected by reserpine attachment to the
transporter.87 with respect to transport parameters associated with vmat2 function, wilson and
kish found no alteration in  xxxd3330xxx  binding site number (vmat2 bmax) in striatal slices from rodents

94

chronically treated with coc.88 these investigators and their colleagues extended these findings
in rodent to postmortem analysis of human striatal tissue, obtained at autopsy from chronic coc
or methamphetamine (meth) users.89,90 in both
cases, while striatal da was depleted, vmat2 levels
were affected in chronic coc (17–22% decrease)
but not in chronic meth users. it is noteworthy
that these investigators used  xxxd3330xxx  binding rather
than quantitative western blotting as an index of
vmat2 levels.
vmat2 is clearly required for the rewarding pharmacological effects of both amph and coc—and
perhaps also for their abuse liability. amph release of da from synapses requires both an action
at vmat2 to release da to the cytoplasm and a
concerted release of da from the cytoplasm via “reverse transport” through dat.40 coc action likewise requires exocytotic release of da from vesicles
filled through the action of vmat2 before it can
fulfill its pharmacological action of inhibiting da
reuptake through dat.50 a consensus developed
in the imaging literature that neither vmat2 protein nor vmat2 transporter function was dynamically regulated by acute or chronic treatment with
drugs of abuse, making dtbz imaging an attractive
candidate for assessing monoaminergic neurodegeneration in disease and after chronic drug use.82
however, this consensus discouraged the view that
vmat2 could be a therapeutic target in disease.
recently, however, the notion that vmat2 could
be regulated dynamically by drugs of abuse (and
therefore might represent a potential site of pharmacological intervention) was proposed by fleckenstein et al., based on their observations that coc
administration in rodents rapidly and reversibly
increased vmat2 vmax and bmax in striatal purified vesicle preparations, while amph administration has the opposite effect (decreased vmat2
vmax and bmax). schwartz et al. have also reported that short term coc treatment (5 days),
but not amph treatment, elevates vmat2 density as measured in membrane particulate fractions of rat striatal homogenates.91 since amph
increases cytoplasmic da (through intracellular
vesicular release) while coc decreases cytoplasmic da (through inhibition of reuptake of extracellular da), these results imply that vmat2 function may be directly regulated by cytoplasmic levels
of neurotransmitter. the discrepancy between the

eiden & weihe

results of wilson and kish obtained via quantitative autoradiography of 3h- xxxd3330xxx  binding in striatal
slices, in which vmat2 density did not change,88
and results obtained by direct measurement of  xxxd3330xxx 
binding in striatal vesicular preparations, where
it did, may reflect regulation through redistribution of vmat2 from small synaptic vesicles to
large vesicles, other organelles, or to nonvesicular
locations.40

altered vmat2 expression in stress
sabban and co-workers have recently reported that
vmat2 is up-regulated in chromaffin cells in vivo
following immobilization stress (sabban et al., in
press, 2010). barr and co-workers have observed
that developmentally dependent aversion learning requires amygdalar dopaminergic up-regulation
that includes increases in both dat and vmat2 expression along with another marker for dopaminergic function, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a1.73
in addition to altered vmat2 protein expression
secondary to altered gene transcription, vmat2 activity in neurons may be regulated by changes in trafficking to multiple vesicle types,92 as postulated by
fleckenstein et al. for measured changes in vmat2
bmax and vmax specific to the small synaptic vesicle
compartment after amph treatment.40 g-proteinspecific regulation of vesicle filling may also involve
molecular changes in vmat2, including phosphorylation, with dramatic effects on sorting between
small and large vesicle compartments of the cell.63
these changes may occur on the order of hours,
days and weeks. they are therefore especially worthy of further investigation in light of the potential
for understanding short- and long-term regulation
of quantal size, and location of neurotransmitter
release, that might underlie the development of addictive behavior, its maintenance, and its waning
and recrudescence in withdrawal and relapse behaviors. the finding of altered vmat2 expression
in aversive learning and stress, both likely components of drug-seeking behavior, withdrawal, and relapse, may provide a critical link in monoaminergic
mediation of rewarding and addictive properties of
amph, coc, and other drugs of abuse.
perspectives in drug abuse and addiction
despite what is known about vmat2 basic biology in brain, and the ability to image it, knowledge
about its role in drug addiction and neonatal suscep-

vmat2 and addiction

tibility to maternal drug use, potential translational
prospects for therapeutics of drug addiction remain
rather primitive. is it possible to blunt reward pathway vulnerability with anti-vmat2 drugs without
causing depression? is it possible to offer neonatal protection against addictive liability with similar
drugs? can we learn more about the mechanisms
of drug addiction and drug-related hedonic behavior with vmat2 pharmacological experiments and
 xxxd3330xxx  imaging? what have we really learned so far
about monoamine synaptic dynamics by imaging
either dat or vmat2, given that altered ligand
binding for these proteins can involve both changes
in protein levels, and altered competition for the
imaging ligand by both endogenous amines and administered drugs?
perhaps the major development of the last decade
concerning vesicular neurotransmitter storage is
the level of control and regulation at the level of
the transporters themselves. not only vmats, but
gaba, glutamate and acetylcholine vesicular transporters seem to be actors in the dynamic control of
vesicular transmitter content as a function of neuronal activity and intracellular signaling by calcium,
kinases, and phosphatases. clearly, vmat2 is an important effector for da release by amph, coc, and
other drugs of abuse. whether its dynamic regulation, especially in the dopaminergic system, might
thus be an important contributor to drug addiction is an intriguing question that is only now being definitively explored. of particular interest is
the linkage between prolonged stress and vmat2
expression in adrenal. whether this extends from
rodent to primate species, and from peripheral to
central neurons is a key question, since altered expression of vmat2 could play a role in enhanced
susceptibility to drug-seeking, maintaining, or relapse behavior as a function of stress.
vmat2, despite its occurrence in all monoaminergic neurons, may be quite specifically regulated by
physiological stressors and drugs in each of them.
in the brain, this appears to be especially the case in
the dopaminergic neuronal population. the functional relationship between the rewarding effects of
drugs of abuse and neurotransmitter availability in
nerve terminal vesicles and cytoplasm is a crucial
one. changes in nerve terminal monoamine stores
driven by chronic use of drugs like meth and coc
are likely to be responsible for tolerance and frank
failure-to-reward. less directly, such mechanisms

may also impact the development of tolerance and
addiction to opiates.43 understanding the dynamics of vmat2 adaptation as vmat2- and datdirected drugs deplete brain monoamines in addiction may provide a unique entrée to the neurochemistry of drug seeking, addiction, and postwithdrawal
relapse.
