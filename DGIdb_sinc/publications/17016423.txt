drugs, their targets and the nature
and number of drug targets
peter imming, christian sinning and achim meyer

abstract | what is a drug target? and how many such targets are there? here, we
consider the nature of drug targets, and by classifying known drug substances on
the basis of the discussed principles we provide an estimation of the total number
of current drug targets.
estimations of the total number of drug
targets are presently dominated by analyses
of the human genome, which are limited
for various reasons, including the inability
to infer the existence of splice variants or
interactions between the encoded proteins
from gene sequences alone, and the fact
that the function of most of the dna in
the genome remains unclear. in 1997,
when 100,000 protein-coding sequences
were hypothesized to exist in the human
genome, drews and  xxxd3100xxx  estimated the
number of molecular targets ‘hit’ by all
marketed drug substances to be only 482
(ref. 1). in 2002, after the sequencing of the
human genome, others arrived at ~8,000
targets of pharmacological interest, of
which nearly 5,000 could be potentially
hit by traditional drug substances, nearly
2,400 by antibodies and ~800 by protein
pharmaceuticals2. and on the basis of
ligand-binding studies, 399 molecular
targets were identified belonging to 130
protein families, and ~3,000 targets for
small-molecule drugs were predicted to
exist by extrapolations from the number
of currently identified such targets in the
human genome3.
in summary, current target counts are
of the order of 102, whereas estimations of
the number of potential drug targets are an
order of magnitude higher. in this paper, we
consider the nature of drug targets, and use a
classification based on this consideration, and
a list of approved drug substances (tables 1–8,
box 1), to estimate the number of known drug
targets, in the following categories:

• enzymes (table 1)

• substrates, metabolites and proteins
(table 2)

• receptors (table 3)

•
•
•
•

ion channels (table 4)
transport proteins (table 5)
dna/rna and the ribosome (table 6)
targets of monoclonal antibodies
(table 7)

• various physicochemical mechanisms
(table 8)

• unknown mechanism of action (box 1)
the nature of drug targets
a prerequisite for counting the number of
targets is defining what a target is. indeed,
this is the crucial, most difficult and also
most arbitrary part of the present approach.
for the purpose of this paper, we consider a
target to be a molecular structure (chemically
definable by at least a molecular mass) that
will undergo a specific interaction with
chemicals that we call drugs because they are
administered to treat or diagnose a disease.
the interaction has a connection with the
clinical effect(s).
this definition implies several constraints. first, the medicinal goal excludes
pharmacological and biochemical tools
from the present approach. second, a major
constraint is a lack of technique. life, including disease, is dynamic, but as we do not yet
directly observe the interactions of drugs
and targets, and only partly notice the subsequent biochemical ‘ripples’ they produce;
we are generally limited to ‘still life’ (for
example, x-ray  xxxd2900xxx  structures)

nature reviews | drug discovery

and to treating targets as static objects.
in the case of g-protein-coupled receptors
(gpcrs), the pharmaceutically most useful
class of receptors, a re-organization of the
protein after drug binding was derived from
biochemical data4, but such approaches are
still in their infancy.
for most drugs, several if not many targets
were identified. consequently, we had to
decide for every drug substance or drug
class which target(s) to include in our list.
for this, we relied on the existence of literature data that showed some connection
between the interaction of the drug with
the biochemical structure of the target and
the clinical effect(s) (not side effects).
a chemical with a certain reactivity or
binding property is used as a drug because
of its clinical effects, but it should be
stressed that it can be challenging to prove
that a certain molecular interaction is
indeed the one triggering the effect(s).
in this respect, knockout mice are proving
increasingly useful. for example, a lack of
effect of a drug in mice lacking a particular
target can provide strong support that the
effects of the drug are mediated by that target
(for a review on knockout mice in target
validation, see ref. 5).
we therefore considered the construction
of knockout animals that lack the target,
with pertinent observation of effects, strong
proof or disproof for a certain mechanism
of action. in the case of receptors, we
regarded the availability and testing of
both agonists and antagonists (and/or
inverse agonists) proof for a mechanism.
in the case of enzyme inhibitors (for example,
cyclooxygenase inhibitors), molecular
interactions and effects of structurally
unrelated substances that are largely
identical were considered proof of the
mechanism. in cases where a drug interaction on the biochemical level was found,
but the biochemical pathway was not yet
known to be connected with the observed
drug effect, the target was not counted. for
antipsychotic drugs in particular, a plethora
of target receptors and receptor subtypes
are known and discussed (see pdsp ki
database in further information and
box 2). however, extensive discussion of
such issues is outside the scope of an article

that tries to cover ‘all’ drug substances.
for the present purpose, we chose to limit
our analysis to published consensus data
on one to three of the main biochemical
targets of drug substances. if there was
no consensus or proof of target and/or
target–effect connection, we included the
respective substances in a part of our list
called ‘unknown mechanism of action’.
the dynamics of drug effects. it would
ultimately be desirable to move away from a
static target definition, but this is hindered
mainly by our inability to gauge the interaction of the aforementioned ‘ripples’ — in
other words, the actual pharmacodynamics
of drugs. all drugs somehow interfere with
signal transduction, receptor signalling and
biochemical equilibria. for many drugs
we know, and for most we suspect, that
they interact with more than one target.
so, there will be simultaneous changes in
several biochemical signals, and there will
be feedback reactions of the pathways disturbed. in most cases, the  xxxg2148xxx  result will not
be linearly deducible from single effects.
for drug combinations, this is even more
complicated. a mechanism-based simulation of pharmacodynamic drug–drug
interactions was published recently6,
highlighting the complexity of interaction
analyses for biological systems. awareness
is also increasing of the nonlinear correlation of molecular interactions and clinical
effects. for example, the importance of
receptor–receptor interactions (receptor
mosaics) was recently summarized for
gpcrs, resulting in the hypothesis that
cooperativity is important for the decoding
of signals, including drug signals7. another
paper reported dopamine fluctuations after

administration of  xxxd1736xxx , followed by a
gradual increase in steady-state dopamine
concentration8. indeed, the dynamics of the
response are what really matters, but are
difficult to assess experimentally. further
examples of dynamic (process) mechanisms
of drug action include non-covalent modifications of the active centre (for example,
acetylation of  xxxd3440xxx  transpeptidases by
beta-lactam antibiotics); allosteric modulation
(for example, benzodiazepine modulation
of gaba (gamma-amino butyric acid) receptors);
drugs that require the receptor to be in a
certain state for binding and inhibition
(for example, ‘trapping’ of k+ channels by
methanesulphoanilide anti-arrhythmic
agents9); drugs that exert their effect indirectly and require a functional background
(for example, the catechol-o-methyl
transferase inhibitor  xxxd2000xxx , the effect
of which is due to the accumulation of nonmetabolized dopamine); anti-infectives
that require the target organism to be
in an active, growing state (for example
beta-lactams); molecules requiring activation
(prodrugs, such as paracetamol); and cases
of modifications of a substrate or cofactor
(for example,  xxxd230xxx , which depletes
tumour cells of asparagine;  xxxd2396xxx ,
which is activated by mycobacteria leading
to an inactive covalently modified  xxxd532xxx ;
and vancomycin, which binds to the
building block bacteria use for constructing
their cell wall).
the macro- and micro-world of targets.
so, for estimations of the total number of
targets, a clinically relevant ‘target’ might
consist not of a single biochemical entity, but
the simultaneous interference of a number
of receptors (pathways, enzymes and so on).

only this will give a  xxxg2148xxx  clinical effect that
might be considered beneficial. as yet, we
are unable to count ‘targets’ in this sense
(‘macro-targets’), and it is only by chance
that most of the current in vitro screening
techniques will identify drugs that work
through such targets.
greater knowledge of how drugs
interact with the body (mechanisms of
action, drug–target interactions) has led
to a reduction of established drug doses
and inspired the development of newer,
highly specific drug substances with a
known mechanism of action. however,
a preoccupation with the molecular details
has sometimes resulted in a tendency to
focus only on this one aspect of the drug
effects. for example, cumulative evidence
now suggests that the proven influence of
certain psychopharmaceuticals on neurotransmitter metabolism has little to do
with the treatment of schizophrenia or
the effectiveness of the drug for this
indication10. here, we touch on a very
basic and important point that cannot be
expanded in the context of this paper but
which deserves to be stressed: with all our
efforts to understand the molecular basis of
drug action, we must not fall into the trap
of reductionism. as roald hoffmann aptly
said in his speech at the nobel banquet:
“chemistry reduced to its simplest terms,
is not physics. medicine is not chemistry ....
knowledge of the specific physiological and
eventually molecular sequence of events
does not help us understand what [a] poet
has to say to us.”

with diseases such as type 1 diabetes, for
example, the molecule insulin is indeed all
that is needed to produce a cure, although
we cannot imitate its regulated secretion. with diseases such as psychoses, for
example, antipsychotic drugs might not
correct nor even interfere with the aspect
of the human constitution that is actually
deranged, and with such drugs molecular
determinism might be counterproductive
to the use and development of therapeutic
approaches. it is thought that rather
than chemically providing a ‘cure’, these
drugs make the patient more responsive
to a therapy that acts at a different level.
reflections on molecular targets are very
important because drugs are molecules,
but it is important not to be too simplistic.
returning to the key question, what do
we count as a target? in the search for molecular reaction partners of drug substances,
we will have to be content with losing sight

box 2 | one drug — many targets
over the past 20 years, drug approval authorities and many pharmacologists have moved away
from combination therapies and asked for rational, single-drug, single-target therapies. this is
understandable, as it rapidly becomes challenging to analyse the contributions of multiple drugs
or those that hit multiple targets to the observed effects, both desirable and undesirable.
the principle that blocking a single pharmacological target with high potency is desirable
because it minimizes the side effects that come with non-specific drugs has become wellestablished, almost dogma, in drug development circles. however, a few examples will suffice to
show that it is an oversimplification. first, despite the appeal of a single-drug-target strategy for
drug development, the most effective anti-arrhythmic compound, amiodarone, is the ‘dirtiest’ of
all anti-arrhythmics33. second, the problems with highly selective  xxxg1884xxx -inhibitors are
considered to be due to their very selectivity, which seems to tip the balance of  xxxd2434xxx - and antithrombotic mediators in an unfavourable way34. third, propranolol is the first and classic
beta-sympatholytic agent, but it has neither an absolute selectivity for an adrenoceptor subtype nor
does it address receptors exclusively; for example, it also inhibits phosphatidic acid
phosphorylase. it is not clear whether the latter activity contributes to the  xxxg2148xxx  clinical effects
(hypotension and so on)35. fourth, oestrogens not only have an intracellular nuclear receptor,
but also activate a membrane-bound one as well (gpr30)36. the effects of oestrogen result from
the interplay of the two mechanisms. fifth, for  xxxd2842xxx , a smooth-muscle relaxant agent,
the following activities were recorded, and all seem to be important for the  xxxg2148xxx  effect: cyclic
nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibition,  xxxg293xxx +-channel blockade and alpha-adrenoreceptor
antagonism37. and last, the anticancer drug imatinib was originally moved into clinical
development on the basis of its capacity to inhibit a single target: the bcr– xxxg23xxx  kinase. it has since
become clear that its success could be linked to interaction with at least two other targets;
indeed, two anticancer drugs, sorafenib and sunitinib, that were developed to inhibit multiple
kinases have recently been approved. as with antipyschotics30, such ‘dirty’ or ‘promiscuous’
anticancer drugs might be increasingly sought in the near future38.

of some of the  xxxg2148xxx  biochemical and especially clinical effects of the drug’s action. a
target definition derived from the  xxxg2148xxx  effect
rather than the direct chemical interaction
will require input from systems biology, a
nascent research field that promises to significantly affect the drug discovery process11.
at the other end of the scale of precision, we
can define some targets very precisely on the
molecular level: for example, we can say that
dihydropyridines block the  xxxg346xxx .2a splicing variant in heart muscle cells of l-type
high-voltage activated calcium channels.
this is an example of a ‘micro-target’. it does
make sense to define it because a subtype or
even splicing variant selectivity could alter
the effectiveness of calcium channel blockers. we could further differentiate between
genetic, transcriptional, post-transcriptional
or age differences between individuals, and
again this will make sense in some cases.
but for a target count, a  xxxd1736xxx  needs to be
drawn somewhere, otherwise the number of
individual patients that receive a drug could
be counted and equated with the number of
known targets. in summary, we will count
neither macro- nor micro-targets, but something in between — admittedly a somewhat
arbitrary distinction.
classification of current drugs
there are a number of possible ways to
classify drug substances (active pharmaceutical ingredients). from the end of the

nine-teenth century until the 1970s,
drug substances were classified in the
same way as other chemical entities:
by the nature of their primary elements,
functional moieties or organic substance
class. recently, the idea of classifying
drug substances strictly according to their
chemical constitution or structure has
been revived. numerous databases now
attempt to gather and organize information
on existing or potential drug substances
according to their chemical structure
and diversity. the objective is to create
substance ‘libraries’ that contain pertinent
information about possible ligands for
new targets (for example, an enzyme or
receptor) of clinical interest12,13 and,
more importantly, to understand the
systematics of molecular recognition14,15
(ligand–receptor).

in situations in which
the dynamic actions of the
drug substance stimulate, or
inhibit, a biological process,
it is necessary to move away
from the descriptions of single
proteins, receptors and so on
and to view the entire signal
chain as the target.

nature reviews | drug discovery

at present, the most commonly used
classification system for drug substances is
the atc system16 (see who collaborating
centre for drug statistics methodology,
further information). it categorizes drug
substances at different levels: anatomy,
therapeutic properties and chemical properties. we recently proposed an alternative
classification system17, although we did not
follow it fully in the arrangement of entries
in tables 1–8, box 1, as explained below.
classification of drug substances according
to targets. in tables 1–8, we arranged drug
substances according to their mechanism
of action. although the term ‘mechanism of
action’ itself implies a classification
according to the dynamics of drug substance effects at the molecular level, the
dynamics of these interactions are only
speculative models at present, and so
mechanism of action can currently only be
used to describe static (micro)targets, as
discussed above.
the actual depth of detail used to define
the target is primarily dependent on the
amount of knowledge available about the
target and its interactions with a drug.
if the target structure has already been
determined, it could still be that the
molecular effect of the drug cannot be fully
described by the interactions with one
target protein alone. for example, antibacterial oxazolidinones interact with
23s-rrna, trna and two polypeptides,
ultimately leading to inhibition of protein
synthesis. in this case, a description of the
mechanism of action that only includes
interactions with the 23s-rrna target would
be too narrowly defined. in particular, in
situations in which the dynamic actions of
the drug substance stimulate, or inhibit, a
biological process, it is necessary to move
away from the descriptions of single proteins, receptors and so on and to view the
entire signal chain as the target. indeed,
it has been pointed out by swinney in an
article on this topic that “two components
are important to the mechanism of action ...
the first component is the initial massaction-dependent interaction ... the second
component requires a coupled biochemical event to create a transition away from
mass-action equilibrium” and “drug mechanisms that create transitions to a nonequilibrium state will be more efficient”18.
this consideration again stresses that dynamics are essential for effective drug action and,
as discussed above, indicates that an effective
drug target comprises a biochemical system
rather than a single molecule.

a further criterion needed for the full
categorization of drug substances according
to their target is the anatomical localization
of the target. this is essential for a differentiation between substances with the same
biochemical target, but a different organ
specificity (for example, nifedipine and
 xxxd3504xxx  are both l-type calcium channel
inhibitors; the former interacts primarily
with vascular calcium channels and the
latter with cardiac calcium channels).
however, in the tables, we chose not to
include this criterion as it would have made
the list more cumbersome.
categorization of current drugs. we began
by sorting substances according to their
target, considering the following biochemical structures to be target families: enzymes
(table 1); substrates, metabolites and proteins
(table 2); receptors (table 3); ion channels
(table 4); transport proteins (table 5);
dna/rna and the ribosome (table 6); targets
of monoclonal antibodies (table 7); various
physicochemical mechanisms (table 8); and
unknown mechanism of action (box 1).
within the families, individual enzymes,
receptors and so on were included if they
were identified in the literature as the main

target(s) of an approved drug substance.
we filled the list shown in tables 1–8,
box 1 by including the following drugs and
their corresponding main targets: all

substances included in the thirteenth model
list of essential medicines published by the
world health organization19 (excluding
the categories: vitamins, minerals, oxygen
as a narcotic gas, and diagnostics); drug
substances included in the fda’s approved
drug products list (25th edition, 2005)20;
all newly developed drugs from the past
5 years introduced on the german market21;
and drugs approved by the fda in 2004
with a new mechanism of action, again
excluding substitution therapeuticals22. we
checked the resulting list against the lists
of targets in drews and  xxxd3100xxx ’s paper1, a
list of enzyme targets in the supplemental
material to robertson’s paper23, and a
compilation of receptors produced for
nomenclature purposes24, and we further
supplemented our list using the current
edition of mutschler’s german textbook
drug actions25.
in this way, tables 1–8, box 1 include
only those targets relevant for the effect of
drugs currently on the market. for drug
substances or classes in the lists, selected
references are given that are concerned with
the mechanism of action; the references are
arranged by target family and subfamily,
and within the subfamilies, alphabetically.
new targets and mechanisms of action
were not listed if a corresponding drug that
interacts with the target has not yet been
marketed. drugs currently undergoing
clinical trials have been excluded for the
sake of briefness and also because of the
numerous status fluctuations of such drugs.

it should be noted that for a certain target,
we did not include all drug substances
that address it, but just a representative
example of the structural classes in use. in
some cases, such as the beta-lactams, we cited
the structural class instead of individual
representatives. we tried to name the first
substance of a class, if it is still marketed.
a subdivision of the major groups
according to the ‘anatomy’ (cell type or
physiological functional unit within which
the target is located and acted on by the
drug) and the substance class has been
carried out in just a few cases for which the
literature seemed to be unanimous about
the identification and relevance of such a
subdivision. in order to keep tables 1–8,
box 1 readable, the main focus has been
given to the classification of the substance
according to its biochemical target.
a categorization going into further detail
is outside the scope of this article, although
of course obtaining further molecular and
cellular detail is possible in some cases.
for example, transport proteins have been
subclassified in great detail26,27, and target
lists have been produced for cancer drugs28.
an extensive list of affinities of cns drugs
for vast numbers of targets is also available
online at the pdsp database (see further
information). the latter list illustrates well
the point discussed previously: that in many
cases it will not help to know a single target,
because the clinical effect is caused by
patterns of target interactions.

of course, our list is an approximation.
and a categorization of compounds
according to their mechanism of action will
inevitably lead to a group of remaining drugs
with proven clinical effectiveness, but an
unknown molecular target. such compounds
can, if at all, only hypothetically be classified
within the selected major groups. the atc
classification system, with its systematic categorization according to therapeutic aspects
(for example, ‘analgesics’) does not have this
problem, as every substance in the list shows

— or is claimed to show — a therapeutic
effect. it will also be the case that, as with the
atc system, certain drug substances appear
more than once in the list. indeed, it will
happen more often than in the atc system,
owing to the fact that some drug effects are
based on the synergistic effects of more than
one mechanism of action.
the number of drug targets
at the level of target definition we chose,
which is illustrated by the table rows, we
counted 218 targets. the most prominent
target families included hydrolases in the
enzyme family, gpcrs in the receptor
family and voltage-gated  xxxg293xxx + channels in
the ion-channel family. the usefulness of
a target family in this count is probably a
consequence of its commonness, the format
of assays (with recent binding-affinity based
assays having contributed little as yet), and
the nature of the diseases that affect the
developed world.
a large part of this paper is concerned
with the nature of drug targets and the need
to consider the dynamics of the drug–targets
(plural intended) interactions, as these
considerations were used to define what we
would eventually count. many successful
drugs have emerged from the simplistic
‘one drug, one target, one disease’ approach
that continues to dominate pharmaceutical
thinking, and we have generally used this
approach when counting targets here.
however, there is an increasing readiness
to challenge this paradigm29–32. we have
discussed its constraints and limitations
in  xxxd3123xxx  of the emerging network view of

targets. the recent progress made in our
understanding of biochemical pathways
and their interaction with drugs is impressive. however, it may be that ‘the more you
know, the harder it gets’. it is not the final
number of targets we counted that is the
most important aspect of this perspective;
rather, we stress how considerations about
what to count can help us gauge the scope
and limitations of our understanding of the
molecular reaction partners of active pharmaceutical ingredients. targets are highly
sophisticated, delicate regulatory pathways
and feedback loops but, at present, we are
still mainly designing drugs that can single
out and, as we tellingly say, ‘hit’ certain
biochemical units — the simple definable,
identifiable targets as described here. this
is not as much as we might have hoped for,
but in keeping with the saying of one of the
earliest medical practitioners, hippocrates:
“life is short, and art long; the crisis fleeting;
experience perilous, and decision difficult.”
humility remains important in medical and
pharmaceutical sciences and practice.

drugs, their targets and the nature and number of drug targets

in table 3b (page 827),  xxxg1385xxx  agonists were wrongly included with nuclear receptors (steroid hormone receptors). they
should have been included with g-protein-coupled receptors in table 3a (page 826). in table 3b, the entry in the ‘ xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx 
receptor’ row, in the column ‘drug examples’, should be ‘ xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx  and analogues’, not ‘ xxxd2071xxx ’, and reference 207 needs to be
deleted accordingly. the authors thank a colleague for drawing their attention to this.
