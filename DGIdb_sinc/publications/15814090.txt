abstract
the effects of drugs that inhibit human ether-a-go-go-related gene (herg) related cardiac potassium channels on the variability of qt
duration as a sign of repolarisation instability were evaluated in conscious telemetered dogs. qt duration variability was determined using a
beat-to-beat analysis before and after the infusions of herg channel blocking agents. variability was evaluated as increased mean width
( p width) and length ( p length) of poincaré plots of 100 consecutive beats. as herg channel blockers which are associated with arrhythmias of
the torsades de pointes (tdp) type, dofetilide and sotalol were infused. verapamil was used as an herg channel blocker that is not associated
with tdp. dofetilide (0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg) dose-dependently prolonged qtc duration (12% and 16%). dofetilide also induced an increase of
qt variability that reached statistical significance for p length at the higher dose (64%). a dose of 3 mg/kg sotalol neither prolonged qtc
duration nor qt duration variability. in contrast,  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg sotalol prolonged qtc duration (15%) and increased p length (33%). doses of 0.1
and 0.3 mg/kg verapamil did not increase qtc duration nor qt time variability. qt duration variability in conscious dogs may be a useful
preclinical marker to discriminate pro-arrhythmogenic and non-arrhythmogenic activities of herg blocking agents.

1. introduction
a variety of drugs including anti-arrhythmics, antihistamines, antipsychotics and miscellaneous agents can induce
qt interval prolongation. most of these agents prolong
cardiac repolarisation by inhibiting the rapidly activating
delayed rectifier potassium current (i kr) encoded by the
human ether a-go-go related-gene (herg). drug-induced
qt interval prolongation is frequently associated with
potentially fatal arrhythmias of the torsades de pointes
(tdp) type (haverkamp et al., 2000), leading to the
withdrawal of some qt-prolonging drugs from the market.
any potential pro-arrhythmic activity is also of great
concern in the pharmaceutical development of new therapeutic agents. regulations thus require the evaluation of

effects of new chemical entities on herg activity and on
qt interval prolongation (shah, 2002).
however, the predictive value of preclinical qt
interval prolongation is doubtful. prolongation of the qt
interval or the action potential duration itself is antiarrhythmic and is the underlying mechanism of class iii
anti-arrhythmic agents (brendorp et al., 2002). thus, other
factors must coincide to enable qt interval prolongation
to become a pro-arrhythmic event. spatial or temporal
heterogeneity of cardiac repolarisation may increase the
pro-arrhythmic risk. studies on rabbit hearts suggest that
an increase in transmural or interventricular dispersion of
repolarisation contributes to the pro-arrhythmic and
torsadogenic risk of qt interval prolonging agents
(eckardt et al., 2002). temporal instability of the
repolarisation phase of the action potential, which
describes the heterogeneity of action potential durations
from one cycle to the next, was found to be an important
determinant of pro-arrhythmia in female rabbit hearts.

among agents with class iii anti-arrhythmic or herg
channel blocking activities, those also producing repolarisation instability had a higher propensity to be proarrhythmic. thus, the induction of in vitro instability of
action potential duration seems to be a good predictor to
discriminate agents documented to have a pro-arrhythmic
potential in clinical practice from those that are believed
not to be pro-arrhythmic (hondeghem and hoffmann,
2003; hondeghem et al., 2003). in view of the predictive
value of in vitro instability of action potential duration,
the evaluation of in vivo instability of the qt interval
might add useful information to the pro-arrhythmic risk
assessment of qt interval prolonging agents. in dogs
fitted with telemetric devices, the variability of qt time
was thus measured in a beat-to-beat electrocardiographic
(ecg) analysis. qt duration variability was determined
before and after the administration of herg blocking
agents believed to be pro-arrhythmic such as dofetilide
(weerapura et al., 2002; van opstal et al., 2001) and
sotalol (numaguchi et al., 2000; weissenburger et al.,
1991). verapamil was studied as a herg blocker with no
or very low pro-arrhythmic potential (zhang et al., 1999;
fossa et al., 2002; redfern et al., 2003). the results
suggest that the qt time variability may be a useful
additional preclinical in vivo surrogate parameter to assess
the risk of herg blocking agents.

2.2. telemetric measurements of blood pressure, heart rate
and ecg
2.2.1. telemetric devices
sensors of the type tl11m2-d70-pct to record blood
pressure and ecg signals were implanted. signals were
picked up by rmc-1 receivers and transferred via the
dataquest art exchange matrix and dataquest open art
acquisition interface to the ponemah digital acquisition
analysis and archive system software. sensors, receivers and
exchange matrix were obtained from data sciences international, st. paul, minnesota, the acquisition and analysis
software from gould, valley view, ohio.

2.1. animals

2.2.2. surgical implantation of transmitters
general anaesthesia was induced by intramuscular
injection of 2 mg/kg xylazine hcl (rompun 2%, bayer,
leverkusen, germany) and 10 mg/kg ketamine hcl
(kemint, alvetra, neumqnster, germany). xylazine injections were repeated when required.
the left flank, the left and right thorax, and the
sternal region were shaved. the left abdominal cavity
was opened and a pressure and biopotential sensor implanted. a fluid-filled catheter of the sensor was inserted
into the iliac artery and passed into the abdominal aorta
for blood pressure measurement. the two biopotential
leads were attached subcutaneously to the left upper
thoracic wall and to the tip of the sternum to record a
lead ii ecg. after surgery, the dogs were treated with
an antibiotic (tardomyocelr) on alternate days for
1 week.

six male beagle dogs (harlan france sarl, gannat,
france) were used for the study. the animals were housed in
individual boxes, but were allowed to move freely in groups
of 1–2 h/day. the dogs were fed a standard laboratory diet
(200–400 g/day) in the form of pellets. tap water was freely
available via an automatic system. a health check was
performed after delivery and before being used in the
experiment. each dog was treated repeatedly with vehicle
or different doses of the test substances at intervals of at least
7 days.

2.2.3. data recording and acquisition
for the experiment, the unrestrained conscious dogs
were allowed to move freely in a 111 m stainless-steel
cage (ebeco, castrop rauxel, germany). two receivers
for the sensor signals were placed on both sides of the
cage. the ecg and blood pressure signals were continuously monitored at a sampling frequency of 2000 hz
using the ponemah system. the recorded and acquired
pressure and ecg signals were analysed automatically
using the ponemah software. the analysis of the ecg

using the formula qtc=qt0.087(rr1000) as described
by van de water et al. (1989). the mean values of these
pre-values taken at 15, 10 and 5 min before start of i.v.
treatment were calculated as baseline values. these
parameters were evaluated repeatedly at different times up
to 120 min after the start of treatment. for each evaluation
time, 10 complete blood pressure and ecg signals were
recorded and averaged.
a repeated measurement analysis of variance with the
factors animal and drug dose was performed to analyse
the drug dose effect on heart rate and qtc. if an overall
drug dose effect over time was detected an analysis of

segments was checked manually in random samples in the
offline mode of the system on completion of an experiment. the data were entered into a special custom-built
application based on the excel 97 programme for tabular
calculations and presentations.
2.2.4. experimental protocol
a 30-min equilibration time was allowed for adaptation
to the cage. three pre-values were then recorded for the
following parameters: systolic, diastolic and mean arterial
blood pressure, heart rate, rr interval, pr, qrs and qt
times. the qt time was corrected for changes in heart rate

in addition to the evaluation of the parameters described
in the experimental protocol, a beat-to-beat analysis of the
ecg was performed 10 min before and 10 min after the
start of the treatment infusions. at these times, qt values
of 100 consecutive cycles were recorded and listed in an
excel sheet. poincaré plots with qtn versus qtn+1 values

3.1. effects of vehicle, dofetilide, sotalol and verapamil on
heart rate and qtc duration
heart rate, qt and qtc durations did not differ
significantly between the treatment groups at baseline
(table 1). infusion of 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg dofetilide had
no effect on heart rate. there was a dose-dependent increase
in qtc duration after both doses of dofetilide. after infusion
of 3.0 and 10.0 mg/kg sotalol heart rate decreased after the
low dose only, whereas after the high dose there was an
increase in qtc duration. infusion of 0.1 mg/kg verapamil
raised the heart rate. qtc duration was not affected by 0.1
and 0.3 mg/kg verapamil (fig. 1). the vehicle solvents did
not influence the parameters of the controls.

control groups treated with the different solvents for
dofetilide, sotalol or verapamil. since these solvents did
not have any effect on qt time variability, only one control
group is shown in table 2 for the sake of clarity.
in vehicle controls there was neither a change versus
baseline of p width nor p length. infusion of 0.01 and 0.03 mg/
kg dofetilide increased the qt duration variability at posttreatment time (10 min p. appl.). this effect reached
statistical significance for p length at the high dose of
dofetilide only. qt duration variability was not influenced
by 3.0 mg/kg sotalol. at the higher dose of 10.0 mg/kg,
sotalol significantly increased p length, whereas p width was
increased insignificantly. infusion of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg
verapamil had no effect on qt time variability.

4. discussion
3.2. effects of vehicle, dofetilide, sotalol and verapamil on
qt time variability
3.2.1. poincaré plots
before and 10 min after start of the infusions of vehicle
solution or drugs, 100 consecutive ecg cycles per dog were
analysed. the qt duration of a cycle was plotted against the
qt duration of the subsequent cycle. some examples are
shown in fig. 2. the plots show qt duration variability at
10 min after start of the infusions in the same individual dog
that was treated on different days with vehicle, dofetilide
(0.03 mg/kg), sotalol (10.0 mg/kg) and verapamil (0.3 mg/
kg). although in that particular dog p length of 11.6 ms was
unusually high after infusion of vehicle, the values of p width
confirm the visual impression of a higher beat-to-beat qt
variability under treatment with dofetilide and sotalol. the
poincaré plot in this dog demonstrated a very low qt
variability following infusion with verapamil.
3.2.2. comparison of qt duration variability between
treatment groups
the meanfs.e.m. values (n=6) of the parameters of qt
duration variability, i.e. p length and p width, at baseline and at
10 min post-treatment time for the different treatment
groups are shown in table 2. there were three different

qt time prolongation by itself does not correlate with the
incidence of drug-induced arrhythmias. thus, there is a need
for additional predictors for the preclinical assessment of the
pro-arrhythmic risk of herg blocking agents (belardinelli
et al., 2003). in our study, we evaluated the effects of three
herg blocking agents on a new in vivo experimental
parameter of cardiac repolarisation instability. in telemetered conscious dogs, the beat-to-beat qt time variability
was scrutinized as a tool to discriminate agents with
different pro-arrhythmic potentials. in vehicle-treated dogs
qt duration variability did not change from baseline to
post-treatment time, indicating the stability of this parameter
under control conditions.
qt length variability was increased by dofetilide and
sotalol. both agents are considered to be pro-arrhythmic
in humans. the results of our study with verapamil,
which is believed to have no, or only a very low proarrhythmic potential, are quite different from the effects
of dofetilide and sotalol. neither the lower nor the higher
dose of verapamil influenced the qt duration variability
in dogs.
dofetilide is a class iii anti-arrhythmic agent (classification according to vaughan williams) for the treatment
of atrial fibrillation (elming et al., 2003). it blocks the

herg encoded repolarising cardiac potassium current i kr
in hek 293 cells very potently with an ic50 value of 12
nm (snyders and chaudhary, 1996). besides its antiarrhythmic activity, dofetilide is potentially pro-arrhythmic
in dog models (van opstal et al., 2001; bauer et al., 2002)
and in humans in whom it can induce tdp arrhythmias
(haverkamp et al., 2000). in dogs with chronic atrioventricular block bradycardia which are prone to tdp
arrhythmias, dofetilide increased monophasic action potential duration, qt time and interventricular dispersion of
qt time at a dose of 0.025 mg/kg (van opstal et al.,
2001). a dose of 0.03 mg/kg dofetilide induced tdps in
one of six normal dogs only, but in dogs with chronic
cardiac hypertrophy this dose of dofetilide induced tdps in
all five animals (kozhevnikov et al., 2002). in our study in
normal dogs, dofetilide at similar doses (0.01 and 0.03 mg/
kg) not only induced a dose-dependent increase in qtc
durations but also increased qt time variability. for
example, this is shown in the poincaré plot of fig. 2 for
a dog treated with the higher dose of dofetilide (0.03 mg/
kg). compared to the vehicle group, the plot indicates a
larger interbeat variability following treatment with dofetilide, suggesting a certain instability of the beat-to-beat
qt time values. this visual impression could be confirmed, at least for the higher dose and for p length, in a
statistically significant manner. the failure of statistical
significance for the lower dose and for p width values most
probably is related to a high deviation of the individual
results (table 2).
sotalol is a class iii anti-arrhythmic agent with an
additional beta-adrenergic blocking effect (buck et al.,
1981) that mainly resides in the levorotatory isomer
(lynch et al., 1984). sotalol inhibits the herg potassium
channel current by 80% at a concentration of 300 am
(numaguchi et al., 2000). inhibition of cardiac repolarisation by sotalol has been demonstrated in canine purkinje
fibres as a concentration-dependent prolongation of the
action potential duration (gintant et al., 2001) or as
prolongation of left ventricular epicardial monophasic
action potential duration in anaesthetised dogs (taggart et
al., 1984). sotalol exhibits pro-arrhythmic activity including the induction of tdps in atrioventricular blocked dogs
with bradycardia and hypokalaemia (weissenburger et al.,
1991). recently, sotalol was shown to increase short-term
variability of the left ventricular monophasic action
potential duration in anaesthetized dogs with electrically
remodelled hearts. this increase in repolarisation variability was associated with tdp occurrence (thomsen et al.,
2004). in left ventricular wedge preparations, sotalol
prolonged the action potential duration to a higher degree
in mid-myocardial (m) cells than in epicardial and
endocardial cells. thus, sotalol increased the spatial
heterogeneity of repolarisation, i.e. it caused different
action potential durations across the ventricular wall
(shimizu et al., 1999). infusion of 3.0 and 10.0 mg/kg
sotalol dose-dependently prolonged qtc duration in our

study (fig. 1). the scatter of the exemplary poincaré plot
(fig. 2) also indicates a high degree of variability of the
qt duration values from one beat to the next in a dog
treated with 10.0 mg/kg sotalol. the qt duration
variability was increased by sotalol as indicated by the
significant change of p length versus baseline at the higher
dose (table 2).
verapamil is a phenylalkylamine calcium channel
blocker used on a broad clinical scale. the activity of
verapamil is not restricted to calcium channels. it inhibits
various potassium channels involved in cardiac repolarisation with different potencies. herg channel activity
(zhang et al., 1999) and i kr current in guinea pig atrial
myocytes (jones et al., 2000) are inhibited by verapamil
with ic50 values of 0.143 am and 3 am, respectively.
although verapamil interferes with cardiac repolarising
potassium channels, it has a low propensity to prolong qt
time and there is no evidence that it induces tdp
arrhythmias (redfern et al., 2003). verapamil even
reverses the action potential duration prolonging activity
of the herg blocker e-4031 (1-[2(6-methyl-2-pyridyl)ethyl]-4(4-methylsulfonylamidobenzoyl) piperidine) in
guinea pig papillary muscles (bril et al., 1998). in contrast
to pro-arrhythmic herg channel blockers, verapamil was
shown not to increase beat-to-beat alternations of the
cardiac monophasic action potential in guinea pigs (fossa
et al., 2004). this favourable safety profile of verapamil
regarding qt time prolongation and related arrhythmias is
considered to be the result of a suitable balance of
potassium and calcium channel blocking activities. in our
study, at both doses (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg), verapamil did not
change the qtc duration (fig. 1). the scatter of an
exemplary poincaré plot is low for a dog treated with 0.3
mg/kg verapamil (fig. 2). furthermore, verapamil did not
influence qt time variability at any dose (table 2). this is
in line with other reports that suggest a low pro-arrhythmic
potential of verapamil.
it might be argued that changes in heart rate may account
for the qt duration variability observed after infusion of
pro-arrhythmic herg channel blockers. qt times adapt to
changes in heart rate but the changes in qt time lag
somewhat behind the changes in heart rate (lau et al.,
1988). this hysteresis effect may be responsible for the
greater variation of the qt length and thus indicate a false
positive effect on repolarisation instability. however, a
comparison of the heart rate and qt duration values in dogs
treated with dofetilide or sotalol show that 10 min after start
of the infusions (the time when the beat-to-beat analysis was
performed), no abrupt changes in heart rate occurred (fig.
1). on the other hand, heart rate fell considerably 5–10 min
after start of the infusion of 0.3 mg/kg verapamil, but the qt
length variability did not change at all in this experimental
group. thus, the observed effects on qt length variability
are independent of changes in heart rate.
the probability that a herg blocker will induce
arrhythmias is related to its ability to induce dispersion or

j. schneider et al. / european journal of pharmacology 512 (2005) 53–60

to increase heterogeneity of ventricular repolarisation.
spatial heterogeneity of ventricular repolarisation can be
evaluated as transmural dispersion across the left ventricular
wall (milberg et al., 2002; antzelevitch and shimizu, 2002),
between the right and left ventricles (schoenmakers et al.,
2003; van opstal et al., 2001) or between the base and the
apex of the heart (bauer et al., 2002). not only spatial
heterogeneity but also temporal heterogeneity of repolarisation may indicate an enhanced risk of pro-arrhythmia.
temporal heterogeneity, demonstrated as beat-to-beat variations in action potential duration in isolated rabbit hearts,
signalised repolarisation instability and was found to be a
reliable predictor of the pro-arrhythmic risk of herg
channel blocking agents (hondeghem et al., 2001, 2003;
hondeghem and hoffmann, 2003). recently, a differentiation of pro-arrhythmia and non-arrhythmic herg
channel blockers was shown in a model of cardiac electric
alternans in the guinea pig (fossa et al., 2004). these
models demonstrated the induction of increased temporal
heterogeneity of cardiac repolarisation by pro-arrhythmic
herg channel blockers.
similar to these models, our study in conscious dogs was
performed on the same assumption that pro-arrhythmia
agents increase temporal dispersion of cardiac repolarisation
whereas non-arrhythmic agents do not. the results obtained
with the herg channel blockers dofetilide, sotalol and
verapamil indicate that the parameter of qt time variability
can discriminate between agents with a high and low risk of
inducing arrhythmias. herg blockers which are associated
with arrhythmias of the tdp type as dofetilide and sotalol
increased the qt time variability. on the other hand,
verapamil as a herg blocker which is not associated with
tdp did not change the qt duration variability in conscious
dogs.
the increases of qt duration variability by dofetilide and
sotalol reached statistical significance only on the parameter
p length but not p width. although a clear trend to an increase
was also seen for p width at both doses of dofetilide and at the
high dose of sotalol, statistical significance was not reached
most probably because group size was too low. therefore,
further studies including these parameters of qt duration
variability should use larger group sizes.
the model of qt duration variability is based on studies in
conscious dogs which are not surgically prepared for the
induction of heart disease. the native status of the animals
used in this study may explain that the pro-arrhythmogenicity
of agents such as dofetilide and sotalol does not lead to the
occurrence of arrhythmias. the qt duration variability is
thought to be a surrogate parameter of the temporal
heterogeneity of cardiac repolarisation that indicates an
enhanced risk of pro-arrhythmia. the model does not allow
any statement on the influence of agents on the spatial
heterogeneity of cardiac repolarisation. despite these limitations, the measurement of the qt duration variability in
conscious dogs may provide further valuable information in
the preclinical risk assessment of herg blocking agents.
