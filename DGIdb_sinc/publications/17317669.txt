 xxxg2198xxx  transmembrane receptors, controls gene
expression and cellular proliferation of breast cancer cells (1).
although it was discovered more than 10 years ago that er␣
could be activated in a ligand-independent fashion by growth
factors like  xxxg681xxx  or igf (2), the cross-talk
between estrogens and growth factor pathways remains to be
elucidated.
in the classical model of er action, the receptor binds as a
homodimer (3) or a heterodimer (4 –7) to estrogen response
elements (eres) within the promoters of estrogen-responsive
genes. once present on the promoter of estrogen responsive
genes, er recruits an array of transcriptional cofactors (coactivators and corepressors) that bind to the receptor and interact
with other transcription factors, including components of the
general transcription machinery. some of these cofactors possess chromatin-remodeling activities or histone modifying
activities or recruit additional proteins to the complex to mediate transcription (for review, see ref. 8). er␣ may also modulate
transcription without receptor-dna interaction by functional
interference with other transcription factors such as activating
protein-1 ( xxxg1222xxx ) (for review, see refs. 9 –12).
the  xxxg1222xxx  complex, which is implicated in diverse cellular
processes, including differentiation, cell proliferation, and
transformation (for review, see ref. 13), predominantly consists
of various combinations of jun (c-jun, junb, jund) and fos
(c-fos,  xxxg811xxx , fra-2, fosb) proteins. this complex can result
from many different combinations of heterodimers and
homodimers, and the combination determines the genes that
are regulated by  xxxg1222xxx  (14, 15). the  xxxg1222xxx  complex formed of
heterodimers or homodimers of jun and fos proteins has dna
binding activity via the tpa-responsive elements (tres).
furthermore transcriptional activity of the  xxxg1222xxx  complex is
post-translationally regulated by several kinases. extracellular
signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 phosphorylate c-fos on
threonines 325 and 331. these phosphorylations regulate the
transforming activity of c-fos (16). moreover, phosphorylation
of c-jun by c-jun nh2-terminal kinases on residues serine 63
(17) and 73 potentiates its ability to activate transcription either
as a homodimer (18, 19) or a heterodimer together with c-fos.
activation of the  xxxg1144xxx  receptor by  xxxg1144xxx  binding leads to a
conformational change of its receptor, the auto phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue in the intracellular part of the receptor, and the subsequent activation of downstream signaling
molecules. then the  xxxg1144xxx  receptor is able to bind signaling

insulin like growth factor i ( xxxg1144xxx ) displays estrogenic activity
in breast cancer cells. this activity is strictly dependent on the
presence of  xxxg730xxx  ␣ (er␣). however the precise
molecular mechanisms involved in this process are still unclear.
 xxxg1144xxx  treatment induces phosphorylation of the af1 domain of
er␣ and activation of estrogen regulated genes. these genes are
characterized by important differences in promoter architecture and response element composition. we show that promoter structure is crucial for  xxxg1144xxx -induced transcription activation. we demonstrate that on a complex promoter such as the
ps2/tff1 promoter, which contains binding sites for er␣ and
for the activating protein-1 ( xxxg1222xxx ) complex, transcriptional activation by  xxxg1144xxx  requires both er␣ and the  xxxg1222xxx  complex.  xxxg1144xxx 
is unable to stimulate transcription of an estrogen-regulated
gene under the control of a minimal promoter containing only a
binding site for er␣. we propose a molecular mechanism with
stepwise assembly of the  xxxg1222xxx  complex and er␣ during transcription activation of ps2/tff1 by  xxxg1144xxx .  xxxg1144xxx  stimulation
induces rapid phosphorylation and an increase in protein levels
of the  xxxg1222xxx  complex. binding of the phosphorylated  xxxg1222xxx  complex to the ps2/tff1 promoter allows recruitment of the chromatin remodeling factor  xxxg2173xxx  followed by binding of er␣ via its
interaction with c-jun.

experimental procedures
chemicals—estradiol was purchased from sigma. ici
184780 ( xxxd2165xxx ) was purchased from zeneca pharmaceuticals.  xxxg1144xxx  was purchased from euromedex.
antibodies—anti-human er␣ (hc20), anti- xxxg2173xxx  (h-88), antiphospho-c-jun (km-1), anti-c-jun (sc-45), and anti-c-fos (h-125)
were purchased from santa cruz biotechnology. anti-c-fos and
anti-phospho-thr-325 (ab27793) were purchased from abcam.
anti- xxxg861xxx  was purchased from chemicon international.
cell lines and tissue culture—mcf7 cells were grown in
dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium/f-12 containing 50 ␮g/ml
 xxxd2193xxx  and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum at 37 °c
in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% co2.
the stably transfected luciferase reporter meln and mtln
cell lines were obtained as previously described (30). briefly, to
obtain meln cells, er␣-positive breast cancer mcf-7 cells
were transfected with the estrogen-responsive gene erebglob-luc-sv-neo (31). to obtain mtln cells, mcf-7 cells
were co-transfected with the  xxxg1222xxx -responsive gene tre3-tkluc and the neomycin resistance gene psv2-neo (32). selection of resistant clones by  xxxd2191xxx  was performed at 1 mg/ml.
meln and mtln cells were grown in dulbecco’s modified
eagle’s medium/f-12 containing 50 ␮g/ml  xxxd2193xxx , 10%
heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, and 1 mg/ml  xxxg418xxx  at 37 °c in
a humidified atmosphere containing 10% co2.
to study the effects of estrogens and  xxxg1144xxx , cells were grown
for 2 days in media without phenol red without  xxxd2193xxx  and
without serum. cells were treated or not with 10 nm estradiol
(e2), 5 nm  xxxg1144xxx , or 100 nm  xxxd2165xxx  for the indicated times.
luciferase assays—cells were grown in 3.5-cm diameter
dishes and treated as indicated in the figure legends. cells were
then lysed in 200 ␮l or promega lysis buffer and frozen. luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase assay reagent (promega e397a) on a centro lb 960 (berthold). luciferase activities were normalized to plated cell number or to total
protein content measured by the amido schwarz technique
(33). all experiments were performed at least in triplicate, and
s.d. were calculated.
western blots—western blots were performed as previously
described (34). the quantity of extract loaded on the gels was
normalized to total protein content, assayed by the amido
schwarz technique. all antibodies were used at a 1/200 dilution, except for anti-phospho-c-fos antibody, in which the
dilution was 1/1000.
chip experiments—cells were grown to 95% confluence in
dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium/f-12 supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum followed by 48 h in serum
and phenol red-free media. after the addition of hormone or
growth factor, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and cross-linked with 1.5% formaldehyde at
37 °c for 5 min. cells were then rinsed twice with ice-cold pbs,
collected into 100 mm tris-hcl, ph 9.4, and 10 mm dithiothreitol, incubated for 15 min at 30 °c, and centrifuged for 5 min at

adaptor proteins like  xxxg1194xxx  substrate 1 ( xxxg1198xxx ) and
shc, linking the receptor to downstream signaling pathways like
the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the mitogen-activated
protein pathways (for review, see ref. 20). growth factors such
as  xxxg1144xxx  are able to elicit estrogenic responses in target tissues
in the absence of estradiol, and they cooperate with the hormone in its presence (21). several studies have demonstrated
that estradiol, anti-estrogens, and growth factors induce a rapid
hyperphosphorylation of er␣ on serine 118, located at the n
terminus within transcriptional activation function af-1 (2, 22,
23). this phosphorylation is essential for activation of er␣
bound or not to its ligand (24). however, this phosphorylation
is not sufficient to elicit estrogenic responses in the absence of
hormone, and there may be other er␣ domains or partners that
fulfill additional requirements for growth factor signaling
through er␣ (22). supporting this, mcf7 breast cancer cells
with a constitutively active  xxxg1361xxx  show increased interaction
between er␣ and its coactivators ( xxxg1511xxx  and  xxxg1512xxx ) and hormone hypersensitivity (25). in addition, phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase, which is activated by  xxxg1144xxx , has been shown to phosphorylate er␣ on serine 167 within 1 h after treatment with
growth factors. active phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase increases
the transcription-stimulating activity of both the af-1 and
af-2 domains of er␣, whereas active protein kinase b (pkb), a
downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, only
increases the activity of af-1, suggesting that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase utilizes pkb-dependent and -independent pathways in activating er␣. in addition,  xxxd2523xxx , a specific inhibitor of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase b
pathway, reduced phosphorylation of er␣ in vivo (26).
the goal of the present study was to better understand the
cross-talk between the  xxxg1144xxx  and estradiol pathways at the
molecular level. we studied the ps2/tff1 gene whose regulation serves as a paradigm for estrogen regulation of gene
expression in breast cancer cells. the ps2/tff1 gene has a
composite promoter with an ere (located between ⫺405 and
⫺393) and a tre ( xxxg1222xxx  response element, located between
⫺338 and ⫺332), and it has been reported that its activation
can be achieved by estradiol or  xxxg1144xxx  (27). our laboratory has
shown that both estradiol and  xxxg1144xxx  treatments induce a rapid
chromatin remodeling of the ps2/tff1 promoter in a region
encompassing the ere and the tre (28). the role of the  xxxg1222xxx 
element in the response of ps2/tff1 to estradiol has been analyzed in detail by others in a cell line derived from the hepg2
hepatocarcinoma cell line, re-expressing er␣. they demonstrate that the ere is essential for the response of ps2/tff1 to
estrogens and that the tre is involved in both estrogen and
phorbol-ester responses (29).
here we demonstrate that activation of er␣ induced by
 xxxg1144xxx  is not sufficient to allow activation of a minimal estrogenregulated promoter containing only an ere sequence. we show
that in response to  xxxg1144xxx  treatment, the  xxxg1222xxx  complex is phosphorylated and rapidly recruited to the ps2/tff1 promoter,
whereas recruitment of er␣ is delayed. on the ps2/tff1 promoter, er␣ and the  xxxg1222xxx  complex cooperate during  xxxg1144xxx -induced activation of the transcription, but have different functions. the  xxxg1222xxx  complex is implicated in chromatin remodeling

results
 xxxg1144xxx -induced activation of the ps2/tff1 gene requires
both er␣ and the  xxxg1222xxx  complex— xxxg1144xxx  is an activator of estrogen-regulated genes in breast cancer cells (21). it promotes
chromatin remodeling at the promoter of the estrogen-regulated gene ps2/tff1 (28). however, its mechanism of action is
not elucidated, and it is not known whether the architecture of
the promoter is important for this activation. this gene has a
complex promoter that contains one binding site for the ere
and one binding site for the  xxxg1222xxx  complex (tre) (fig. 1a). we
first determined the importance of these two transcription factors in  xxxg1144xxx -induced activation of the ps2/tff1 gene. as previously described (21) in mcf7 cells,  xxxg1144xxx  alone induced transcriptional activation of the estrogen-regulated gene ps2/tff1
(fig. 1b). to assess the importance of er␣ in this activation, we
treated cells both with  xxxg1144xxx  and the pure antiestrogen  xxxd2165xxx  ( xxxd2165xxx  780). when bound to  xxxd2165xxx , er␣ is rapidly

resuspended in 0.3 ml of lysis buffer (1% sds, 10 mm edta, 50
mm tris-hcl, ph 8.1, 1⫻ protease inhibitor mixture (roche
applied science)) and sonicated three times for 15 s with a
branson sonifier 250 (duty cycle 50%, output control 5) followed by centrifugation for 10 min. supernatants were collected and diluted in buffer (1% triton x-100, 2 mm edta, 150
mm nacl, 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.1) followed by immuno-clearing with 2 ␮g of sheared salmon sperm dna, 20 ␮l of preimmune serum, and protein a-sepharose (45 ␮l of 50% slurry in
10 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.1, 1 mm edta) for 2 h at 4 °c. immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °c with specific
antibodies. after immunoprecipitation, 100 ␮l of protein
a-sepharose and 2 ␮g of salmon sperm dna were added, and
the incubation was continued for another 1 h. precipitates were
washed sequentially for 10 min each in tse i (0.1% sds, 1%

65 °c. eluates were heated at 65 °c overnight to reverse the
formaldehyde cross-linking. after cross-link reversion, 1⁄3 of the
dna fragments were purified with a genelute pcr clean-up
kit (sigma), and 1⁄20 of the purified dna was quantified by quantitative pcr. quantitative pcr were performed on an icycler
(bio-rad) using the oligonucleotides ps2 ch1 (5⬘-ggccatctctcactatgaatcacttctgc-3⬘) and ps2 ch2 (5⬘ggcaggctctgtttgcttaaagagcg-3⬘) to amplify
the ps2/tff1 promoter fragment. amplification conditions
were 3 min at 95 °c followed by 50 cycles (20 s at 95 °c, 30 s at
62.5 °c, 20 s 72 °c). for the purification of the inputs, 20 ␮l of
extract was removed and heated overnight at 65 °c, dna was
then purified as for immunoprecipitates, and 1⁄20 of the dna
was quantified by quantitative pcr.
co-immunoprecipitations—for co-immunoprecipitations of
cross-linked protein complexes, 1 ⫻ 106 cells were submitted to
immunoprecipitation as in the chip procedure, except that
after immuno-recovery proteins were eluted by the addition of
30 ␮l of h2o and 10 ␮l of 4⫻ electrophoresis loading buffer
(200 mm tris, ph 6.8, 8% sds, 20% glycerol, 8 mm edta, 6%

the immunoprecipitated material was electrophoresed on sds
gels and analyzed by western blotting.
for co-immunoprecipitations of native protein complexes,
1 ⫻ 106 mcf7 cells, grown for 3 days in steroid-free medium,
were washed twice in pbs, resuspended in 500 ␮l of lysis buffer

degraded in the nucleus (35, 36) and consequently never binds
dna (37). here we found that  xxxd2165xxx  blocked the igf-iinduced transcription of ps2/tff1 (fig. 1b) confirming that
er␣ is necessary for  xxxg1144xxx -induced transcription of this promoter (27). to go further in the role of er␣ in  xxxg1144xxx  mediated
activation of the ps2/tff1 gene, we knocked down er␣ using
sirnas directed against er␣ mrna. mcf7 cells were then
stimulated by  xxxg1144xxx  or not for 24 h, and rna was purified. the
specificity of sirna depletion was analyzed by western blot
(fig. 1c) and showed that sirna directed against er␣ mrna
caused a specific and dramatic decrease in er␣ protein levels
compared with scramble sirna. the administration of er␣
sirna to mcf7 cells abolished the  xxxg1144xxx -mediated activation
of the ps2/tff1 gene compared with cells electroporated by
scramble sirna (fig. 1d). this result reinforces the results
obtained with  xxxd2165xxx  and demonstrates that er␣ is
required for  xxxg1144xxx -mediated activation of the ps2/tff1 gene.
to evaluate the importance of c-jun and c-fos for the ps2/
tff1 activation mediated by  xxxg1144xxx , we knocked down the two
proteins using sirnas directed against c-jun or c-fos mrna.
they were administrated to mcf7 cells separately or in combination. cells were then stimulated or not by  xxxg1144xxx , and rna
was purified. the effect of sirna depletion of c-jun and c-fos
was analyzed by western blot (fig. 2a). sirna directed against
c-fos was able to specifically lower c-fos protein levels,
whereas sirna directed against c-jun lowered both c-jun and
april 20, 2007 • volume 282 • number 16

c-fos protein levels. lowering the protein level of a transcription factor involved in the formation of heterodimers often
induces a decrease in partner protein levels. moreover in the
case of the  xxxg1222xxx  complex, c-jun is able to homodimerize, preventing its degradation when c-fos protein levels are lowered.
c-jun and c-fos sirna have a clear effect on ps2/tff1 activation mediated by  xxxg1144xxx  (fig. 2b), dramatically impairing its activation compared with cells electroporated with the scramble
sirna. treatment of cells with both sirnas also abolished
 xxxg1144xxx -mediated activation of the ps2/tff1 gene. these results
demonstrate that both er␣ c-jun and c-fos are essential for
 xxxg1144xxx  action and that in the cell the absence of one these proteins cannot be compensated by the presence of other members
of their respective families.
activation of estrogen-regulated genes by  xxxg1144xxx  requires a
composite promoter—we have shown that both er␣ and the
 xxxg1222xxx  complex are required for  xxxg1144xxx -mediated activation of
the ps2/tff1 gene. to better understand the role of each of
the two promoter elements (ere and tre) in this transcriptional activation, we used the meln cell line that has been
derived from mcf-7 cells and engineered to express the
reporter gene luciferase under the control of a synthetic promoter containing only an ere upstream of a minimal ␤-globin
promoter (fig. 3a). these cells were untreated or treated with
estradiol and  xxxg1144xxx  alone or in combination, and induction of
luciferase,  xxxg861xxx  mrna, and ps2/tff1 mrna were measured. fig. 3b shows a robust induction of luciferase activity by
estradiol, whereas  xxxg1144xxx  had no effect. the increase in  xxxg861xxx 
gene expression (a gene known to be induced by  xxxg1144xxx  (38))
after treatment of the meln cells by  xxxg1144xxx  (fig. 3c) demonstrates that the  xxxg1144xxx  pathway is not impaired in this cell line.
this was further confirmed by the induction of the endogenous
ps2/tff1 gene by estradiol as well as by  xxxg1144xxx  in the meln cell
line (fig. 3d). these results indicate that  xxxg1144xxx  treatment is not
sufficient to promote the activation of a promoter containing a
single ere.
to investigate the importance of the tre element in igf-imediated activation of ps2/tff1, we used a cell line engineered

 xxxg1144xxx -induced activation of the ps2/tff1 gene

to express luciferase under the control of a promoter containing tres, which are recognized by the  xxxg1222xxx  complex (fig. 4a).
in this experiment we used tpa, which is a well known inducer
of the  xxxg1222xxx  complex (39, 40) as a positive control. upon  xxxg1144xxx 
treatment of the cells, luciferase activity was induced 3-fold
when compared with untreated cells (fig. 4b). we conclude
that  xxxg1144xxx  can activate a minimal promoter containing tre
elements. concomitant treatment of the cells with either  xxxg1144xxx 
or tpa and  xxxd2165xxx  or estradiol did not change the level of
activation of luciferase compared with cells treated with  xxxg1144xxx 
or tpa alone (fig. 4b, compare lanes ⫹tpa with ⫹tpa ⫹ici
and lanes ⫹ xxxg1144xxx  with ⫹e2 ⫹ xxxg1144xxx  and with ⫹ici ⫹ xxxg1144xxx ).
this result demonstrates that the effect of  xxxd2165xxx  on the
activation of the ps2/tff1 gene by  xxxg1144xxx  (see fig. 1b) is not due
to a defect in the signal transduction pathway mediated by
 xxxg1144xxx  in the presence of  xxxd2165xxx . this also demonstrates
that  xxxg1222xxx -mediated activation of tre3-tk-luc promoter is
independent of er␣ action. taken together, these results indicate that er␣ is able to cooperate with the  xxxg1222xxx  complex to
promote transcription on composite promoters such as ps2/
tff1 and that promoter architecture is crucial for the cooperation between the  xxxg1222xxx  complex and er␣.
the  xxxg1222xxx  complex binding precedes the association of er␣ on
the ps2/tff1 promoter after  xxxg1144xxx  stimulation—these data
raise the question of the exact role of er␣ and the  xxxg1222xxx  complex
in ps2/tff1 activation upon  xxxg1144xxx  stimulation. in the context
of estrogen-stimulation, er␣ is recruited precociously to the
ps2/tff1 promoter, and it plays a central role in triggering
transcription of the ps2/tff1 gene (37). we wondered if in the

mcf7 cells were treated for the indicated times with  xxxg1144xxx . a, nuclear extracts
containing cross-linked proteins were prepared as for chip experiments and
immunoprecipitated (ip) with anti-c-jun or anti-c-fos antibodies. the presence of er␣ in the eluates was analyzed by western blot using anti-er␣ antibody. b, native protein complexes were prepared as indicated under “experimental procedures” and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-c-jun

plex, c-jun and c-fos. first, the levels of the two proteins were
increased (fig. 7a). the c-fos concentration increased rapidly,
and within 30 min the protein level reached 50% that of its
maximal level. the increase in c-jun was slower, reaching 50%
that of its maximal level after 80 min of  xxxg1144xxx  treatment. these
results are in agreement with the fact that  xxxg1144xxx  treatment
induces an increase of mrna levels of both c-jun and c-fos
(42). second, c-jun and c-fos are phosphorylated upon  xxxg1144xxx 
treatment of the cells (fig. 7b). phosphorylation of c-fos was
rapid, occurring within 15 min and strong on threonine 325
(fig. 7b), a key residue in c-fos activation known to be phosphorylated by extracellular signal-regulated kinases (16). this
phosphorylation level was maintained over time. phosphorylation of the c-jun protein on serine 63 (fig. 7b), which is located
within its transactivation domain, was slower and reached its
maximal level after 3 h of treatment with  xxxg1144xxx .
the increase in unphosphorylated and phosphorylated c-jun
and c-fos levels was quantified from the blots, and the ratio of
phosphorylated c-jun and c-fos over total c-jun and c-fos proteins was calculated. fig. 7c showed a constant increase, up to
12-fold of the phospho-c-jun/c-jun ratio. this indicates that
 xxxg1144xxx  induces an increase in both c-jun protein levels and c-jun
phosphorylation but that phosphorylation increased more than
the amount of the protein. for the phospho-c-fos/c-fos ratio, a
dramatic increase (more than 100-fold) occurred within 15 min
after treatment with  xxxg1144xxx  and decreased rapidly. after 2 h of
treatment the phospho-c-fos/c-fos ratio remained constant
and was approximately three times the basal level. this reveals
that  xxxg1144xxx  induces rapid phosphorylation of c-fos more rapidly

compared with the untreated control (fig. 5). after 3 h of  xxxg1144xxx 
stimulation, c-jun and c-fos were still present on the ps2/tff1
promoter roughly to the same extent as after 1 h of treatment.
their binding to dna was ⬃4-fold higher than that of the
untreated controls. after 3 h of  xxxg1144xxx  stimulation, a strong
recruitment of er␣ to the ps2/tff1 promoter was observed
(16-fold more than in the untreated control, fig. 5). using the
irrelevant anti-igg antibodies, no enrichment of ps2/tff1
dna could be detected in between the different experimental
conditions. these results taken together with the fact that  xxxg1144xxx 
treatment is not sufficient to promote the activation of a promoter containing a single ere suggests that the  xxxg1222xxx  complex
could be the factor recruiting er␣ to the ps2/tff1 promoter.
 xxxg1144xxx  induces phosphorylation of the  xxxg1222xxx  complex and promotes its interaction with er␣—results shown above indicate
that both er␣ and the  xxxg1222xxx  complex are recruited to the ps2/
tff1 promoter but with different timing,  xxxg1222xxx  complex being
recruited earlier than er␣. therefore, we investigated the
mechanisms involved in the delayed interaction of er␣ with the
ps2/tff1 promoter and if  xxxg1222xxx  complex could be responsible
for this recruitment. first we studied the effect of  xxxg1144xxx  stimulation on the physical interaction between er␣ and the  xxxg1222xxx 
complex. it has been previously shown that c-jun and er␣
interact directly in intact cells, forming a protein complex in a
ligand-dependent manner (41). however, to date no interaction between er␣ and c-fos has been described. to assess if
er␣ and the c-jun-c-fos complex belong to the same protein
complex after exposure to growth factors, we treated mcf7
cells for various times by  xxxg1144xxx  and cross-linked the proteins in
whole cells to preserve the integrity of the complexes. this was
followed by co-immunoprecipitation using anti-c-fos and antic-jun antibodies. western blots using an antibody directed
against er␣ showed that both c-jun and c-fos co-immunoprecipitated with er␣ upon stimulation by  xxxg1144xxx  (fig. 6a). there
was no detectable interaction between c-jun and er␣ after 1 h,
a weak interaction after 2 h, and a strong interaction after 3 h of
 xxxg1144xxx  stimulation. co-immunoprecipitation of c-fos and er␣
was weaker than that of c-jun and er␣, also maximal after 3 h of
treatment with  xxxg1144xxx . to get further insights on the interaction
between er␣ and the  xxxg1222xxx  complex, we performed co-immunoprecipitations on native protein complexes under stringent
conditions. after 3 h of  xxxg1144xxx  stimulation a clear interaction
between er␣ and c-jun could be detected (fig. 6b), confirming
the results obtained on cross-linked complexes and suggesting
a strong interaction between these two transcription factors. in
contrast, we were unable to detect any interaction between er␣
and c-fos under  xxxg1144xxx  stimulation (data not shown), suggesting
that these two proteins, even if they belong to the same complex, as suggested by the cross-linking experiments, probably
did not interact directly or have a weak interaction.
 xxxg1144xxx  treatment causes the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways, leading to the phosphorylation of many transcription factors and mediators. we then investigated if there was a
correlation between the phosphorylation state of  xxxg1222xxx  complex
and the time course of interaction between  xxxg1222xxx  complex and
er␣. fig. 7 shows the effects of  xxxg1144xxx  treatment on the two main
proteins implicated in the proliferative action of the  xxxg1222xxx  com-

than its synthesis. c-fos phosphorylation is sustained during its
synthesis occurs (fig. 7, panel c, inset).
these data indicate that the  xxxg1144xxx -dependent interaction
between the c-jun complex and er␣ correlates with the time
course of phosphorylation of c-jun, suggesting a direct role of
c-jun phosphorylation in the interaction between er␣ and the
 xxxg1222xxx  complex. moreover this interaction of er␣ with c-jun after
3 h of  xxxg1144xxx  treatment coincides with the phosphorylated state
of both c-jun and c-fos and a strong recruitment of er␣ to the
ps2/tff1 promoter. we propose, therefore, that the  xxxg1222xxx  complex is responsible for the recruitment of er␣ to this promoter
by  xxxg1144xxx .
chromatin remodeling of the ps2/tff1 gene activated by
 xxxg1144xxx  is mediated by direct recruitment of  xxxg2173xxx  by  xxxg1222xxx —our

discussion
functional cooperation between er␣ and the  xxxg1222xxx  complex
is dictated by promoter structure—we have investigated the
cross-talk between estradiol and  xxxg1144xxx  signaling pathways in
breast cancer cell lines. for this work we used three different
kinds of promoters, a complex promoter containing both
er␣ and  xxxg1222xxx  response elements and two minimal promoters, one containing one binding site for er␣ and the other
containing three binding sites for the  xxxg1222xxx  complex. we
show that cross-talk between er␣ and the  xxxg1222xxx  complex is
greatly influenced by the structure of the promoter. first,
our data, obtained in a cell line derived from mcf-7 cells
that express luciferase under the control of a synthetic promoter containing an ere, demonstrate that  xxxg1144xxx  is unable
to stimulate transcription of a gene driven by a promoter
containing only an estrogen response element. this result
contrasts with a previous report that showed that  xxxg1144xxx  was
able to induce the expression of a luciferase reporter transgene driven by a promoter containing two eres in the uterus

er␣ to the ps2/tff1 promoter
upon  xxxg1144xxx  stimulation. however,
the precise mechanism is still
unknown. we have previously demonstrated in mcf-7 cells that  xxxg1144xxx 
treatment induces chromatin remodeling of ps2/ttf1 promoter
after 2 h of treatment (28). to assess
if the chromatin remodeling of this
promoter is due to the recruitment of
er␣ or of  xxxg1222xxx , we analyzed by chip
the presence of  xxxg2173xxx , a chromatin
remodeling factor recruited precociously to the ps2/tff1 promoter
(37). mcf7 cells were treated for 1 h
either with estradiol,  xxxg1144xxx , or  xxxd2165xxx  alone or with a combination of
 xxxg1144xxx  and  xxxd2165xxx , and we measured the quantities of  xxxg2173xxx  associated
to the promoter (fig. 8). upon estradiol stimulation,  xxxg2173xxx  was rapidly
recruited to the ps2/tff1 promoter,

suggesting that  xxxg2173xxx  may be responsible for  xxxg1144xxx -induced

resulted in a recruitment of  xxxg2173xxx  similar to that obtained by

 xxxg1144xxx -induced activation of the ps2/tff1 gene

april 20, 2007 • volume 282 • number 16

numbers of publications assume that growth factors
induce a change in er␣ phosphorylation directly via the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and/or akt
pathways. however, whether or not the post-translational
modifications of er␣ induce its binding to the ere in the
absence of hormone remains unclear. our results rule out
the possibility that phosphorylation of er␣ induced by  xxxg1144xxx -is sufficient to directly induce er␣ binding to the ere in
the absence of hormone. first,  xxxg1144xxx  does not activate transcription of a gene under the control of a promoter containing only an ere, and secondly, we see a strong induction of
the er␣ binding to the ps2/tff1 promoter after 1 h of estradiol treatment (data not shown) but not after 1 h of  xxxg1144xxx 
treatment.  xxxg1222xxx  is a target of the  xxxg1144xxx  signaling pathway. we
observed, as previously described, an increase in the protein
levels of the two subunits of  xxxg1222xxx , c-fos and c-jun, after treatment with  xxxg1144xxx  c-fos, increasing more rapidly than c-jun.
activation of both  xxxg1222xxx  subunits by phosphorylation
occurred at different rates, c-fos being very rapidly phosphorylated, whereas c-jun phosphorylation was delayed. it
has been described that estradiol induces an interaction
between er␣ and c-jun, but not c-fos (46). we observed that
 xxxg1144xxx  treatment induced interaction of er␣ with c-jun, with
a time course corresponding to c-jun phosphorylation. furthermore, the co immunoprecipitation studies on native
protein complexes show a strong interaction between er␣
and c-jun upon  xxxg1144xxx  stimulation.  xxxg1144xxx  treatment also
induced er␣ interaction with c-fos but with a time course
that did not follow c-fos phosphorylation. however, we
were able to co-immunoprecipitate er␣ and c-fos in crosslinked protein complexes but not in native ones. this suggests that er␣ and c-fos belong to the same protein complex, but that their interaction is either indirect or weak.
furthermore, the extent of interaction between er␣ and
c-jun corresponds to the level of phosphorylation of c-jun
observed over time, suggesting that this interaction may be
mediated by c-jun. because we did not see an interaction
between er␣ and c-jun after 1 h of treatment with  xxxg1144xxx ,
whereas there was a clear interaction after a 3-h treatment,
we analyzed er␣ recruitment to the ps2/tff1 promoter.
contrasting with what was seen after 1-h of treatment, after
3 h  xxxg1144xxx  induced recruitment of er␣ to the ps2/tff1 promoter, suggesting that this process is mediated by c-jun. the
delay in the recruitment of er␣ to the ps2/tff1 promoter (3
h) indicates that er␣ does not play any role in the chromatin
remodeling that precedes transcription initiation of this
gene, but rather, in later stages of transcription. this
hypothesis is reinforced by a recent report that investigated
the distribution of a green fluorescent protein-er␣ fusion
transiently expressed in mcf-7 cells after treatment with
estradiol or growth factors (47). estradiol induced the formation of speckles, which are associated to a transcriptionally active form of er␣ within 10 min. in contrast, after treatment with  xxxg1144xxx , the maximum er␣ redistribution was
observed only after 90 min.

induces an increase in c-fos and c-jun protein levels as well
as their phosphorylation and the binding of  xxxg1222xxx  to the tre

of transgenic mice (43). the difference could be due to an
impairment of the  xxxg1144xxx  pathway in cell line meln. induction of  xxxg861xxx  and ps2/tff1 by  xxxg1144xxx  indicates that this is
not the case. thus, this discrepancy may come from the type
of minimal promoter used. for our study we used a reporter
gene under the control of the ␤-globin minimal promoter
with an estrogen response element, whereas klotz et al. (43)
used the minimal thymidine kinase promoter. another possibility could be that the promoter used to drive the transgene in mice contains a cryptic  xxxg1222xxx  or sp1 response element. in addition, differences may be species-specific
(human versus mouse) or tissue-specific (breast cancer cells
versus normal uterus). the use of a cell line containing the
luciferase gene under control of tpa response elements
(that binds  xxxg1222xxx ) shows that  xxxg1144xxx  (and phorbol esters)
induces luciferase activity and that this induction is not
affected by anti-estrogens such as  xxxd2165xxx . this finding
confirms a previous report demonstrating that  xxxd2165xxx 
does not inhibit  xxxg1144xxx  signaling (44) and that on this kind of
promoter er␣ does not play any role in  xxxg1144xxx -induced activation of the  xxxg1222xxx  complex. studies on synthetic promoters
report that the use of anti-estrogens stimulates  xxxg1222xxx  transcriptional activity and that dna binding activity of er␣ is
not required for this activation (45). our studies on the
endogenous promoter ps2/tff1 demonstrate that the
molecular mechanisms of cooperation between er␣ and
 xxxg1222xxx  complex differ on endogenous estrogen-regulated promoters. first, a combined treatment of mcf7 cells by  xxxg1144xxx ,
which activates the  xxxg1222xxx  complex, and  xxxd2165xxx , which
blocks er␣ action and causes its rapid degradation (35, 36),
inhibits ps2/tff1 transcription. lowering protein levels of
er␣ by the use of sirna in cells treated with  xxxg1144xxx  leads to
the same result, demonstrating that er␣ is crucial for  xxxg1144xxx 
mediated activation of this gene. moreover, invalidation of
the  xxxg1222xxx  complex by sirna also causes loss of  xxxg1144xxx  mediated activation of the ps2/tff1 gene. these results clearly
indicate that on an endogenous promoter like ps2/tff1
both er␣ and  xxxg1222xxx  are required for ligand-independent activation of this gene. furthermore, for full cooperation
between these transcription factors after  xxxg1144xxx  stimulation,
both  xxxg1222xxx  and er␣ response elements are required. this suggests that dna binding activity of both transcription factors
is necessary.
the  xxxg1222xxx  complex and er␣ play different roles during transcription activation of the ps2/tff1 gene—we have previously described that both estradiol and  xxxg1144xxx  are able to induce
chromatin remodeling of ps2/tff1 promoter (28). here we
show that both estradiol and  xxxg1144xxx  are able to induce recruitment of  xxxg2173xxx  to the ps2/tff1 promoter. in the presence of
estradiol, er␣ may recruit  xxxg2173xxx . upon  xxxg1144xxx  treatment,  xxxg2173xxx 
could be recruited either by er␣ or by  xxxg1222xxx . however, the fact
that  xxxd2165xxx  does not prevent  xxxg1144xxx -induced recruitment of
 xxxg2173xxx  and the fact that er␣ is not recruited to ps2/tff1 promoter after 1 h of  xxxg1144xxx  treatment support a direct role of  xxxg1222xxx 
in this process. this suggests that transcriptional activation of
the ps2/tff1 gene via er␣ and/or via the  xxxg1222xxx  complex obeys
different mechanisms.

 xxxg1144xxx -induced activation of the ps2/tff1 gene

of ps2/tff1 promoter. when bound to dna, the  xxxg1222xxx  complex can recruit factors involved in chromatin remodeling,
such as  xxxg2173xxx . next, the increase in c-jun protein levels and
phosphorylation allows the recruiting of more er␣ and to
tether it, via its interaction with  xxxg1222xxx , to the ps2/tff1 promoter at the ere sequence. thereby, dna-bound er␣ can
recruit coactivators and maintain a high level of transcription of the ps2/tff1 gene.
in this study we did not investigate er␣ phosphorylation
status under  xxxg1144xxx  stimulation. therefore, we cannot exclude
the possibility that some  xxxg1144xxx -induced er␣ phosphorylation
may contribute to the formation of the complex with c-jun in
the absence of hormone, favoring indirect recruitment of er␣
to the promoter.
our work provides new insights in the field of ligand-independent regulation of er␣. it is well known that er␣ and the
 xxxg1222xxx  complex cooperate during transcription activation.
here we demonstrate that after  xxxg1144xxx  stimulation both er␣
and the  xxxg1222xxx  complex are required for transcription activation of the ps2/tff1 gene but play different roles in this
molecular mechanism.

figure 9. estrogenic activity of  xxxg1144xxx ; a model of er␣- xxxg1222xxx  cooperation. a, upon  xxxg1144xxx  stimulation, c-fos and c-jun are phosphorylated and
can dimerize to form the  xxxg1222xxx  complex. b, this complex binds to the ps2/
tff1 promoter at the tre sequence and induces chromatin remodeling by
recruiting  xxxg2173xxx . c, the increase in c-jun protein levels and phosphorylation allows the recruiting and tethering of more er␣ via its interaction
with  xxxg1222xxx  to the ps2/tff1 promoter at the ere sequence. d, thereby, dnabound er␣ can recruit coactivators and maintain a high level of transcription of the ps2/tff1 gene.
