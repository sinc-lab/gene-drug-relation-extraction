abstract
 xxxd2855xxx  inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine
kinases, through which it mediates antiangiogenic
and antitumour effects.
the clinical efficacy of oral  xxxd2855xxx  in patients
with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (sts) was demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase iii trial (palette), generally confirming
the findings of an earlier, noncomparative phase ii study.
in the multicentre palette trial,  xxxd2855xxx 
800 mg once daily significantly prolonged median
progression-free survival (pfs; primary endpoint)
Â»3-fold relative to placebo (4.6 vs 1.6 months) in
adults with progressive metastatic sts following
standard chemotherapy.
according to subgroup analyses,  xxxd2855xxx  provided benefit over placebo in terms of pfs regardless
of whether the tumour was low/intermediate or high
grade and regardless of tumour histology (leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, other sts), although
patients with adipocytic sts were among those excluded from the palette trial, as sufficient benefit had not been shown with the drug in patients
with adipocytic sts in the phase ii study.
at final analysis of the palette trial, median
overall survival was Â»2 months longer with  xxxd2855xxx  than with placebo, although this betweengroup difference was not statistically significant.
oral  xxxd2855xxx  generally had no detrimental
effect on health-related quality of life and had an
acceptable tolerability profile in patients with sts
in the palette trial, with adverse events generally
being grade 1 or 2 in severity.

soft tissue sarcomas (stss) are a rare group of
diverse tumours that represent <1% of all malignancies and cause the death of around half of
those who are diagnosed.[1] in the us, <11 300
new cases and 3900 deaths were estimated to occur
in 2012.[2] these tumours, which are of mesodermal
origin, develop in connective or supportive tissues
and often occur sporadically without clear cause,
although they have also been associated with certain genetic disorders (e.g.  xxxg2313xxx )
and factors such as prior radiation therapy.[1,3,4]
the standard curative treatment option for
localized disease is surgical resection, combined
with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy if considered appropriate.[5-7] these modalities are also
among the management options for advanced
sts,[3,5-7] although as the overall survival of patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease
is Â»12 months and has not markedly improved in
over 20 years,[4] the search for alternative treatment options continues.
therapies targeting proangiogenic factors have
been a focus of drug development for sts in recent years, as the importance of the  xxxg2413xxx  (vegf) pathway in the
pathogenesis of these tumours has continued to
emerge. a quarter of stss overexpress vegf, and
associations have been observed between vegf
levels and tumour grade as well as between high
vegf expression and chemotherapy resistance.[8,9]
evidence supporting the involvement of other
proangiogenic factors in sts are less robust,[9]
although upregulation of platelet-derived growth
factor receptor ( xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx ), basic fibroblast growth
factor ( xxxg787xxx ),  xxxg1428xxx ,  xxxg161xxx  and notch-1 and -4 has been observed.[8,9]
 xxxd2855xxx  ( xxxd2855xxx ) is an inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks), including
vegf receptor ( xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx )-1, -2 and -3,  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx -a
and -b and stem cell factor receptor (kit). it
is indicated in the us[10] and eu[11] for the treatment of advanced sts in patients who have received prior chemotherapy[10,11] or have progressed
within 12 months of neoadjuvant therapy,[11] and
has also recently received approval for a similar
indication in japan.[12] the drug is also approved
for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma in the us[10] and eu.[11] this review focuses

specifically on the pharmacological, clinical efficacy and tolerability data relevant to the use of
 xxxd2855xxx  in sts.
medical literature (including published and
unpublished data) on the use of  xxxd2855xxx  in
patients with advanced sts was identified by
searching databases for studies published since
1996 (including medline, embase), bibliographies from published literature, clinical trial
registries/databases and websites (including those
of regional regulatory agencies and the manufacturer). additional information (including contributory unpublished data) was also requested
from the company developing the drug. searches
were last updated 1 october 2012.
1. pharmacodynamic properties
this section reviews the key pharmacodynamic
properties of  xxxd2855xxx . data are predominantly
from preclinical studies,[13-17] with limited pharmacodynamic data for the drug in patients with advanced malignancies, including sarcoma, available
from a phase i study (discussed in section 4)[18] in
which oral  xxxd2855xxx  was administered at dosages
of 50 or 100 mg three times weekly, 50â€“2000 mg
once daily, or 300 or 400 mg twice daily.
mechanism of action

  xxxd2855xxx  is an inhibitor of multiple rtks,
through which it mediates antiangiogenic and antitumour effects. in vitro, the drug displayed potent
activity against  xxxg800xxx , -2 and -3,  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx -a
and -b and kit ( xxxd2855xxx  concentration required
to inhibit these targets by 50% [ic50] was 0.01â€“
0.084 mmol/l) and modest activity against several
other kinases, including fibroblast growth factor
receptor-1 and -3, interleukin-2-inducible t-cell
kinase, lymphocyte-specific protein  xxxg2198xxx 
and transmembrane glycoprotein receptor tyrosine
kinase (ic50 values of 0.13â€“0.43 mmol/l).[13]
 inhibition of ligand-induced phosphorylation of
 xxxg800xxx [14] and -2,[13-15]  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx -b[13] and kit[13]
and activation of downstream signalling targets
(specifically extracellular signal-related kinase and
akt-1)[14] was also observed with  xxxd2855xxx  in vitro.
 the  xxxg2198xxx  inhibition profile of
 xxxd2855xxx  differed from that of sunitinib and
drugs 2012; 72 (16)

adis drug profile:  xxxd2855xxx 

sorafenib in some respects according to another
in vitro study.[16] in particular,  xxxd2855xxx  was a
less potent inhibitor of kit than sunitinib and a
less potent inhibitor of fms-like  xxxg2198xxx -3
( xxxg801xxx ) than both sunitinib and sorafenib, indicating that the risk of myelosuppression may
differ among these agents, given that kit and
 xxxg801xxx  signalling is required for mature haematopoietic cells to be generated optimally.
antiangiogenesis and antitumour effects

  xxxd2855xxx  inhibited  xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx  in patients with
advanced cancer in a dose-escalating phase i
study,[18] as measured using plasma vegf levels
as a biomarker of tumour growth inhibition.
around half of the  xxxd2855xxx  recipients (22 of
45 evaluable) in this study had plasma vegf
levels increase â€¡3-fold from baseline at least once
during the initial 22 days of treatment, with similar
findings reported in a subset of patients who
received  xxxd2855xxx  â€¡800 mg once daily or 300 or
400 mg twice daily (17 of 30 patients). elevations
in plasma vegf levels typically occur in response
to angiogenesis inhibition and tumour hypoxia.
 moreover, in a murine xenograft model of
non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc), total levels
of  xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx -b were significantly
reduced with  xxxd2855xxx , consistent with a reduction in pericytes, endothelial and/or stromal cells.[17]
 antiangiogenic effects of  xxxd2855xxx  were seen
in the tumours of patients with advanced malignancies in the dose-expansion phase of the phase
i trial,[18] with tumour blood flow (as measured
by the initial area under the gadolinium concentration-time curve on dynamic contrast mri)
being reduced by â€¡50% in 7 of 12 (58%) patients
evaluable on day 8 of treatment and in 10 of 11
(91%) patients evaluable on day 22. these findings are generally supported by data from murine
models of angiogenesis[13,15] and murine xenograft
models of human nsclc[17] or multiple myeloma,[14] in which  xxxd2855xxx  inhibited angiogenesis[14,15] (induced by vegf or  xxxg787xxx )[13] and
reduced tumour microvessel density[17] and the
proportion of pericyte-covered vessels.[17]
 in vitro,  xxxd2855xxx  inhibited vegf-induced
proliferation,[13-15] migration[14] and tubule formation[14] of endothelial cells. the drug also generally

attenuated the growth, survival and vegfinduced migration of multiple myeloma cells,[14]
although it did not affect the proliferation of a
variety of tumour cell types in another study.[13]
  xxxd2855xxx  displayed antitumour activity in
murine xenograft models of various human cancers, causing inhibition of tumour growth[13-15,17]
(dose-dependently in most instances[13-15]), increasing tumour apoptosis[14] and prolonging overall
survival.[14] in addition, changes in the tumour
microenvironment of nsclc xenografts were seen
with  xxxd2855xxx , with the drug reducing tumour
interstitial fluid pressure and increasing hypoxia.[17]
2. pharmacokinetic properties
this section reviews the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd2855xxx . some data are available from
the us[10] and eu[11] prescribing information and
the us fda clinical pharmacology and biopharmaceutics review.[19]
absorption and distribution

 following daily administration of  xxxd2855xxx 
800 mg, the geometric mean maximum plasma
concentration (cmax) of the drug was 58.1 mg/ml
and the geometric mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc) was 1037 mg h/ml.[10]
the cmax of oral  xxxd2855xxx  is reached in a
median time of 2â€“4 hours post-dose.[10]
 increases in  xxxd2855xxx  exposure were less than
dose-proportional across dosages of 50â€“2000 mg
once daily in patients with solid tumours, which
may be an indication that the drug is absorbed in
a nonlinear fashion.[19]
 accumulation of  xxxd2855xxx  was significant in
patients with solid tumours who received  xxxd2855xxx  800 mg once daily for 22 days, with a mean
accumulation ratio of 4 (90% ci 2.6, 6.1) reported.[19]
 systemic exposure to  xxxd2855xxx  (as measured
by mean cmax and auc from time zero to 72 hours
[auc72]) was increased Â»2-fold in the fed versus
the fasted state following a single 800 mg dose of
 xxxd2855xxx  in 24 patients with advanced solid
tumours;[20]  xxxd2855xxx  should be taken at least
1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.[10,11]
  xxxd2855xxx  tablets should not be crushed or
broken before ingestion, as exposure to the drug

may be increased.[10,11] in nine patients with
advanced solid tumours who received a single
400 mg dose of oral  xxxd2855xxx , mean cmax and
auc72 values were 109% and 46% higher and the
median time to cmax was Â»2 hours shorter after
crushed- than after whole-tablet administration.[21]
 there is a relationship between steady-state
trough plasma concentrations of  xxxd2855xxx  and
increases in bp.[10] among patients with advanced
cancer who participated in a phase i trial,[18]
hypertension developed in 77% (20 of 26 patients)
of those with a  xxxd2855xxx  trough concentration
of â€¡15 mg/ml on day 22 of treatment versus 39%
(11 of 28 patients) of those with a trough concentration <15 mg/ml.
 the absolute bioavailability of  xxxd2855xxx  was
14â€“39% in three patients with solid tumours who
received a single 5 mg intravenous dose.[19]
  xxxd2855xxx  is highly plasma protein bound
in vivo (>99%), independent of concentration across
 xxxd2855xxx  concentrations of 10â€“100 mg/ml.[10,11]
metabolism and elimination

 metabolism of  xxxd2855xxx  occurs predominantly via the cytochrome p450 (cyp) enzyme
cyp3a4, with cyp1a2 and  xxxg586xxx  playing
only a minor role.[10,11] at least seven metabolites
were identified in the systemic circulation, faeces
and/or urine after administration of oral radiolabelled  xxxd2855xxx  solution in three patients with
solid tumours, although <10% of the total radioactivity in blood and plasma was accounted for
by individual metabolites.[19] unchanged  xxxd2855xxx  was the main drug-related component in
plasma (>86% of radioactivity), blood (>79%)
and faeces (>65%).[19]
 exposure to unchanged  xxxd2855xxx  is responsible for the majority of the drugâ€™s activity. among
the four principal  xxxd2855xxx  metabolites, one
displays similar potency to the parent drug in inhibiting vegf-induced endothelial cell proliferation (all others have 10- to 20-fold lower activity).[11]
 elimination of  xxxd2855xxx  after oral administration of a radiolabelled dose was mainly via
the faeces (82.2%) in patients with solid tumours,
with only 2.6% being excreted via the urine.[19]
following administration of  xxxd2855xxx  800 mg,
the mean half-life of the drug was 30.9 hours.[10,11]
adis Âª 2012 springer international publishing ag. all rights reserved.

special patient groups

 systemic exposure to  xxxd2855xxx  is reduced in
patients with hepatic impairment. relative to
patients with normal hepatic function receiving
 xxxd2855xxx  800 mg once daily (n = 18), steadystate median cmax and auc from time zero to
24 hours (auc24) values were 35% and 13% lower
in patients with mild hepatic impairment receiving  xxxd2855xxx  800 mg/day (n = 12), 58% and 71%
lower in patients with moderate impairment receiving  xxxd2855xxx  200 mg/day (maximum tolerated dosage in this population) [n = 11] and 82%
and 85% lower in patients with severe impairment
receiving  xxxd2855xxx  200 mg/day (n = 14).[10]
  xxxd2855xxx  is not recommended for use in
severe hepatic impairment,[10,11] and alternatives
to  xxxd2855xxx [10] or a reduction in its dosage (to
200 mg/day)[10,11] are recommended for patients
with moderate impairment; dosage adjustments
are not required for patients with mildly impaired
hepatic function.[10,11]
 according to population pharmacokinetic
data from patients with various cancers (n = 408),
the clearance of  xxxd2855xxx  was not influenced
by creatinine clearance (clcr) in the range of
30â€“150 ml/min (1.8â€“9 l/h).[10] these findings, and
the fact that renal excretion of  xxxd2855xxx  is
minimal, indicate that the pharmacokinetics of
 xxxd2855xxx  are unlikely to be significantly altered
by renal impairment; thus dosage adjustments are
not necessary in the eu (if clcr is >30 ml/min
[>1.8 l/h])[11] or the us.[10] no data are available
concerning the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2855xxx  in
patients with severely impaired renal function or
undergoing haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.[10]
in the eu,  xxxd2855xxx  should be used with caution
in patients with clcr <30 ml/min (<1.8 l/h),
given the lack of experience with the drug in this
population.[11]
3. drug interactions
  xxxd2855xxx  concentrations may be increased
upon coadministration with strong inhibitors
of cyp3a4 (e.g. ketoconazole, clarithromycin,
ritonavir).[10,11] thus, the dosage of  xxxd2855xxx 
may need to be reduced if concomitant use of a
strong cyp3a4 inhibitor is unavoidable.[10,11]
drugs 2012; 72 (16)

adis drug profile:  xxxd2855xxx 

grapefruit juice also inhibits cyp3a4 and should
be avoided.[10,11]
 coadministering  xxxd2855xxx  with agents that
strongly induce cyp3a4 (e.g. rifampicin [rifampin]) may reduce the concentration of  xxxd2855xxx 
in plasma, and should be avoided.[10,11] if chronic
treatment with a strong cyp3a4 inducer is unavoidable,  xxxd2855xxx  should not be used.[10]
 in vitro evidence suggests that  xxxd2855xxx  may
inhibit several key cyp enzymes and potentially
induce cyp3a4.[10,11] data in patients with cancer who received  xxxd2855xxx  800 mg once daily suggested that  xxxd2855xxx  weakly inhibited  xxxg586xxx ,
cyp2d6 and cyp3a4, but did not affect
cyp1a2, cyp2c9 or cyp2c19 to any clinically
relevant extent.[10] in the us,  xxxd2855xxx  is not
recommended for coadministration with agents
that are substrates of  xxxg586xxx , cyp2d6 or
cyp3a4 if the therapeutic window is narrow, as
metabolism of these agents may be inhibited,
which could potentially lead to serious adverse
events.[10]
 elevated liver enzyme levels, including alt,
often occur with  xxxd2855xxx  therapy (section 5).
in  xxxd2855xxx  monotherapy trials, the incidence
of alt levels more than three times the upper
limit of normal (uln) was almost 2-fold greater
in patients receiving concurrent treatment with
simvastatin than in those not receiving statins
(27% vs 14% of patients; p = 0.038).[10,11] coadministration of  xxxd2855xxx  with simvastatin requires
caution and close monitoring;[10,11] data are not
yet sufficient to evaluate the risk associated with
administering  xxxd2855xxx  concomitantly with other
statins,[10,11] and in the eu caution is advised with
such coadministration.[11]
 both organic anion transporter 1b1 and
 xxxd3476xxx  glucuronosyltransferase 1a1
( xxxg2379xxx   xxxg2380xxx   xxxg2381xxx   xxxg2383xxx   xxxg2384xxx ) were inhibited by  xxxd2855xxx  in vitro;
therefore, coadministration of  xxxd2855xxx  with
agents that are eliminated by these proteins may
increase the concentration of the agents.[10] in the
eu, concomitant use of  xxxd2855xxx  with drugs
that are  xxxg2379xxx   xxxg2380xxx   xxxg2381xxx   xxxg2383xxx   xxxg2384xxx  substrates (e.g. irinotecan)
requires caution.[11]
  xxxd2855xxx  may be a substrate of  xxxg22xxx  ( xxxg22xxx ) and p-glycoprotein
( xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx ), according to in vitro data.[10] when

 xxxd2855xxx  was coadministered with lapatinib
(a cyp3a4,  xxxg22xxx  and  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  inhibitor), the cmax
and auc24 of  xxxd2855xxx  were increased by
Â»50â€“60%.[10] coadministering  xxxd2855xxx  with
agents that potently inhibit  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  or  xxxg22xxx  may
result in changes to  xxxd2855xxx  distribution and
exposure, and in the eu such coadministration
should be avoided.[11] in addition, care is advised
when coadministering  xxxd2855xxx  with oral agents
that are substrates of  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  or  xxxg22xxx , as inhibition
of gastrointestinal tract  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  and  xxxg22xxx  with
 xxxd2855xxx  cannot be excluded.[11]
4. therapeutic efficacy
this section focuses on the clinical efficacy of
oral  xxxd2855xxx  in the treatment of patients with
metastatic sts, as evaluated in a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase iii trial,
known as palette ( xxxd2855xxx  explored in
soft-tisue sarcoma â€“ a phase 3 study).[22] the
key findings of earlier phase i/ii trials[18,23] are also
discussed. some additional data are available
as abstracts[24,25] or posters[26] or from the fda
briefing document[27] or other sources.[28]
phase i/ii trials

an initial phase i dose-escalating study of oral
 xxxd2855xxx  was conducted in patients with advanced solid tumours refractory to conventional
treatment or with tumours for which there was no
conventional treatment option (63 patients treated).[18] among the six patients in the sarcoma
cohort, three achieved stable disease of 7.6â€“19.8
months duration (progression-free survival [pfs]
and overall survival were not reported). on the
basis of this study, a  xxxd2855xxx  dosage of 800 mg
once daily was implemented in phase ii trials.
the clinical efficacy of  xxxd2855xxx  was further
evaluated in adults with relapsed or refractory
advanced sts in a noncomparative phase ii
study (n = 142 enrolled).[23] eligible patients had
tumours considered incurable by radiotherapy or
surgery and were either not suitable for chemotherapy or had previously received treatment with
up to two cytotoxic agents (sequentially) or fewer
than two combination therapies for advanced
drugs 2012; 72 (16)

disease. patients had to have measurable disease
and progression in the last 6 months (as defined
by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors
[recist] version 1.0) as well as a who performance status of 0 or 1. certain subtypes of sarcoma
were excluded, including chondrosarcoma, ewing
sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumours, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, dermatofibrosarcoma
protuberans, gastrointestinal stromal tumours
(gist), inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour,
osteosarcoma and malignant mesothelioma.
eligible patients were recruited into four groups
based on sarcoma subtype (adipocytic sarcomas,
leiomyosarcomas, synovial sarcomas and other
eligible sarcomas [i.e. fibroblastic, fibrohistiocytic,
vascular and skeletal muscle sarcomas, malignant
peripheral nerve sheath, glomus and solitary
fibrous tumours, sarcomas of uncertain differentiation/undifferentiated and other sarcomas
approved by the study coordinator]) and received
oral  xxxd2855xxx  800 mg once daily until disease
progression, unacceptable tolerability or consent
withdrawal.[23,28] the study applied a simon twostage testing procedure to each of the four individual cohorts; if the progression-free rate
(pfr) at 12 weeks (i.e. the proportion of patients
alive without progression at 12 weeks) [primary
endpoint] was Â£20% after initial recruitment (i.e.
stage 1 of the trial), further investigation (and
thus accrual) in that cohort was not considered to
be warranted, whereas additional evaluation was
considered justified if the 12-week pfr was â€¡40%.
overall, the median follow-up was 677 days (i.e.
Â»22 months).
  xxxd2855xxx  demonstrated antitumour activity
in patients with certain types of advanced sts.
the pfr after 12 weeks of therapy was 44% (18
of 41 evaluable patients) in the leiomyosarcoma
cohort, 49% (18 of 37) in the synovial sarcoma
cohort and 39% (16 of 41) in the other eligible
sarcoma cohort.[23] accrual of patients into the
adipocytic sarcoma cohort was terminated after
stage 1 of the trial, as the stipulated pfr to
warrant further expansion of the cohort was not
reached (pfr at 12 weeks was 17.6% [3 of 17 patients]). however, two additional patients, originally recruited into other cohorts but later found via
central histopathological review to have adipoadis Âª 2012 springer international publishing ag. all rights reserved.

cytic sarcoma, also had a successful pfr, which
increased the adipocytic sarcoma cohort pfr to
26%.
 there were no complete responses, although
nine partial responses were observed (one in
the leiomyosarcoma group, five in the synovial
sarcoma group and three in the other eligible
sarcomas group); at the last follow-up (415â€“812
days after therapy initiation), five of the nine
patients (one with leiomyosarcoma and four with
synovial sarcoma) remained progression free.[23]
 the median pfs in the leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma and other eligible sarcoma groups
was 91, 161 and 91 days, respectively, and the
median overall survival was 354, 310 and 299 days.
corresponding values in the adipocytic cohort
were 80 and 197 days.[23]
 the potential for baseline serum soluble factors to be used as predictive markers of  xxxd2855xxx  efficacy was also explored in this study
(n = 85 evaluated).[24] some factors demonstrated
a significant (p < 0.05) positive correlation with
the pfr at 12 weeks (interleukin [il]-12 p40 and
mpc3), pfs (b- xxxg1564xxx  and hepatocyte
growth factor) or overall survival (intracellular
adhesion molecule-1 and il-2ra). however, given
the high false discovery rates, these findings
should be interpreted with caution.
phase iii trial (palette)

patients eligible for inclusion in the palette
trial were adults with metastatic sts with progression of disease (defined by recist version 1.0)
in the last 6 months (or 12 months if adjuvant
therapy had previously been given), despite receiving one or more anthracycline-based regimens
and up to four lines of systemic therapy for metastatic disease (see table i for further details).[22]
the sts subtypes eligible for this study were based
on the findings of the earlier phase ii trial;[23]
adipocytic sarcomas were therefore excluded
based on the limited benefit previously noted
(table i).[22] patients recruited into the palette
study had leiomyosarcoma (43%), synovial sarcoma (10%) or other eligible sts (47%) and,
overall, more than half (56%) had previously received at least two lines of treatment.[22,27]

thrombosis, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, new york heart association class iii or iv congestive heart failure, coronary artery
bypass grafting, cardiac angioplasty or stenting

eligible patients underwent stratification (based
on who performance status and number of lines
of systemic treatment previously received for advanced disease) and were then randomized to receive  xxxd2855xxx  or placebo once daily (see table ii
for details).[22] therapy was continued until there
was progression of disease (defined by recist;
crossover at progression was not permitted), unacceptable tolerability, consent withdrawal or
death; the median duration of treatment in the
 xxxd2855xxx  and placebo groups was 16.4 and
8.1 weeks. efficacy was assessed in the intent-totreat population; the primary endpoint was pfs,
defined as the time from randomization to first
disease progression (assessed by blinded independent radiological review) or any cause death.[22]
data from the palette trial were assessed
in two separate analyses.[29] one was a regulatory
analysis conducted by the manufacturer of  xxxd2855xxx , whereas the other was conducted for
publication by the european organization for
research and treatment of cancer (hereafter referred to as the academic analysis). the analyses
differed primarily with regard to patient censoring (see table ii for details);[29] for completeness,
both analyses are discussed.
  xxxd2855xxx  800 mg once daily significantly
prolonged pfs relative to placebo in adults with
progressive metastatic sts following standard
chemotherapy.  xxxd2855xxx  recipients had a median pfs almost 3-fold longer than that of placebo

subgroup analyses suggested that  xxxd2855xxx 
provided significant benefit over placebo in terms
of pfs regardless of the histology of the tumour
or whether the tumour was low/intermediate or
high grade (table iii).[27]

 when various baseline patient characteristics
were assessed for prognostic potential in a univariate cox analysis, tumour grade (i or ii vs iii),
performance status (0 vs 1) and the number
of prior lines of systemic therapy (0â€“1 vs 2â€“4)
appeared to be significantly (p < 0.05) predictive
of pfs, with the predictive value of low or
intermediate tumour grade and good performance status remaining significant (p < 0.05) in
a subsequent multivariate cox analysis.[22]
 in the academic analysis,[22] according to independent radiological review, 6% of  xxxd2855xxx 
versus 0% of placebo recipients achieved a partial
tumour response, while the remaining patients
had stable disease (67% vs 38%), disease progression (23% vs 57%), early death (1% vs 5%) or
could not be assessed (3% vs 0%). similar
findings were reported in the regulatory analysis
via this method (4% and 0% of  xxxd2855xxx  and
placebo recipients achieved a partial response,
54% and 27% had stable disease and 27% and
62% had disease progression).[27] these data are
supported in part by investigator assessment (9%
of  xxxd2855xxx  vs 0% of placebo recipients achieved a
partial response in both analyses).[22,27]
 at final analysis, there was no statistically
significant benefit of  xxxd2855xxx  over placebo in
terms of median overall survival in either the
academic[22] or regulatory[27] analysis (table ii);
no patient baseline characteristics were found to

be predictive of this outcome.[25] however, postprogression therapy was often administered (at the
discretion of patient and physician) and varied
considerably; it is not known what impact this
may have had on the overall survival findings.[22]
in addition, as the placebo group median overall
survival was 2.7 months longer than originally
estimated, the power of the trial to detect a
3-month overall survival benefit with  xxxd2855xxx 
was <50%.[22]
health-related quality of life

  xxxd2855xxx  had no detrimental effect on overall health-related quality of life (hr-qol), as
evaluated by the european organization for
research and treatment of cancer quality-oflife questionnaire-c30, with  xxxd2855xxx  and placebo recipients not significantly differing in terms
of global hr-qol scale scores over 12 weeks of
treatment.[22] however,  xxxd2855xxx  was generally
associated with clinically relevant worsening of
diarrhoea, loss of appetite and nausea/vomiting
from weeks 4â€“12 (differences vs placebo at week
12 of 20.9, 13.2 and 12.3 points, respectively),
although clinically relevant worsening of fatigue
was only seen at week 4 (difference vs placebo of
10.1 points) [all p Â£ 0.012 for each overall betweengroup difference).[22] overall, 1.5-fold more  xxxd2855xxx  than placebo recipients experienced one
or more minimally important worsenings of these
symptoms (74.8% vs 51.2%).[26] in both treatment
groups, hr-qol generally declined with time,
most likely reflecting underlying disease.[26]
5. tolerability
this section focuses on descriptive tolerability
data pertaining to the use of oral  xxxd2855xxx 
800 mg once daily in patients with metastatic sts
in the palette trial (discussed in section 4).
tolerability data are available from both the
academic[22] and the regulatory[10] analysis of this
study; each analysis included a similar number of
patients (see figure 1) but handled adverse event
data slightly differently, with those reported as
â€˜otherâ€™ on the case report forms in the academic
analysis being included under the associated
medical dictionary for regulatory activities

preferred term in the regulatory analysis, which
may have resulted in slight differences in the
names and rates of some adverse events.[29] overall, the tolerability profile of  xxxd2855xxx  was generally consistent between the two analyses, with
discussion in this section focusing on the published academic analysis, except where data are
limited. grading of adverse events was based on
the us national cancer institute common toxicity criteria for adverse events (version 3).[10,22]

a pooled analysis, which included data from the
palette trial and an earlier phase ii study[23]
(see section 4 for details) and is available from the
eu prescribing information,[11] is also briefly
discussed.
general tolerability profile

 the tolerability profile of oral  xxxd2855xxx  was
acceptable in adults with sts in the palette
trial, with adverse events generally being grade 1
or 2 in severity.[22] the most common (incidence
>25%) treatment-emergent adverse events of any
grade that occurred with  xxxd2855xxx  included
fatigue, diarrhoea, nausea, weight loss, hypertension, anorexia, hair hypopigmentation, vomiting
and dysgeusia (figure 1).[22]
 treatment-emergent grade 3 adverse events
that occurred most frequently and with at least a
1% greater incidence with  xxxd2855xxx  than with
placebo included fatigue (13% vs 5%), hypertension (7% vs 3%), anorexia (6% vs 0%), diarrhoea
(5% vs 1%), nausea (3% vs 2%), vomiting (3% vs
1%) and mucositis (1% vs 0%); grade 4 fatigue
was documented in two patients (one in each
group).[22]
 dosage reductions were required by 39% of
 xxxd2855xxx  and 4% of placebo recipients, mostly
because of hypertension, fatigue, diarrhoea, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, hand-foot syndrome and
elevated liver enzymes.[22] in the respective treatment groups, interruptions in treatment occurred
in 49% and 9% of patients, while toxic effects
related to study drug resulted in treatment discontinuation of 14% and 1% of patients.
 serious adverse events were fatal in eight
 xxxd2855xxx  and six placebo recipients; however,
only one (multiorgan failure in the  xxxd2855xxx 
group) was considered to be possibly related to
study drug or antibacterial use.[22]
 use of  xxxd2855xxx  in patients with sts was
associated with a tolerability profile generally consistent with that seen in patients with renal cell
carcinoma, although the likelihood of some
adverse events appeared to be greater, including
thromboembolic events, pneumothorax and myocardial dysfunction,[27] making these adverse events
of particular interest in the sts population.
drugs 2012; 72 (16)

deeks

2138

 among patients with sts who received
 xxxd2855xxx  or placebo in the palette trial,
5% and 2% had venous thromboembolism (vte)
[which included two fatal pulmonary embolisms
in the  xxxd2855xxx  group],[10,22] 2% and 0% had
myocardial infarction/ischaemia,[10] 0.4% and 0%
had a cerebrovascular accident,[10] 3% and 1% had
pneumothorax,[22] and 16 and 3 patients had
reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef).[22]
lvef reductions were symptomatic in three
patients, and eight patients (for whom follow-up
data are available) had improvements in lvef at
the primary clinical cutoff.[22] congestive heart
failure (chf) occurred in three  xxxd2855xxx  recipients; one case did not resolve.[10] of note, cardiac
adverse events were given particular attention in
this study, as patients had previously received
treament with anthracyclines (see section 4),[22]
which are known to induce cardiotoxicity.[30]
 prolongation of the qt interval (i.e. a value
500â€“549 ms post-baseline) was reported in 0.2%
of  xxxd2855xxx  recipients, whereas no placebo recipients had a post-baseline corrected qt interval
â€¡500 ms.[10]
 among other adverse events of interest, at
least one haemorrhagic event (most commonly
epistaxis) occurred in 22% of  xxxd2855xxx  versus 8% of placebo recipients, with 1% of the
 xxxd2855xxx  group experiencing grade 4 haemorrhagic events (intracranial, subarachnoid and
peritoneal haemorrhage).[10] hypothyroidism was
documented in 5% of  xxxd2855xxx  and no placebo
recipients.[10]
 treatment-related adverse events (all grades)
that occurred most frequently (incidence â€¡25%)
with  xxxd2855xxx  in a pooled analysis of sts trials
(n = 382) included fatigue (47%), diarrhoea (46%),
nausea (44%), hypertension (40%), tumour pain
(32%), reduced appetite (28%) and vomiting (25%);
however, these were generally grade 1 or 2 in
severity.[11]
laboratory abnormalities

 among selected laboratory abnormalities (all
grades) that were commonly documented (incidence
>25%) with  xxxd2855xxx  in the palette trial, the
most frequent were elevated ast, alt or glucose,
leukopenia and lymphocytopenia (figure 1).[10]
adis Âª 2012 springer international publishing ag. all rights reserved.

 grade 3 laboratory abnormalities that occurred with at least a 2% greater incidence with
 xxxd2855xxx  than with placebo included elevated
alt (8% vs 2%), elevated ast (5% vs 2%),
neutropenia (4% vs 0%), thrombocytopenia (3%
vs 0%) and elevated alkaline phosphatase (3% vs
1%). some of these abnormalities also occurred
with grade 4 severity in a small proportion of
 xxxd2855xxx  or placebo recipients: elevated ast
(3% vs 0%), elevated alt (2% vs 1%) and thrombocytopenia (1% vs 0%).[10]
 among  xxxd2855xxx  and placebo recipients,
18% and 5% had alt levels >3 Â· uln, 5% and
2% had alt levels >8 Â· uln and 2% and 0.8%
had both alt >3 Â· uln and bilirubin >2 Â· uln
without concurrent significant elevations in alkaline phosphatase (i.e. >3 Â· uln).[10] dose modification generally improved grade 3 alt/ast
elevations, although there was clinical evidence of
liver failure at the time of death in three  xxxd2855xxx 
recipients and  xxxd2855xxx  was thought to have
probably played a role in the development of at
least one of these cases.[27]
 in some  xxxd2855xxx  recipients, hyperbilirubinaemia may be a manifestation of gilbertâ€™s
syndrome, a condition caused by  xxxg2379xxx   xxxg2380xxx   xxxg2381xxx   xxxg2383xxx   xxxg2384xxx  polymorphisms and associated with benign episodes
of jaundice.[31]
 the us prescribing information contains
a boxed warning stating that severe and fatal
hepatotoxicity has occurred with  xxxd2855xxx  in
clinical trials.[10] consequently, treatment with
 xxxd2855xxx  requires hepatic function monitoring,
with dosage interruption, reduction or discontinuation as necessary (section 6).[10]
6. dosage and administration
for the treatment of adults with advanced
sts, the recommended  xxxd2855xxx  dosage in
the us[10] and eu[11] is 800 mg once daily, administered orally without food, at least 1 hour
before or 2 hours after a meal. the dosage may be
modified in 200 mg increments based on individual patient tolerability, but should not exceed
800 mg/day. the efficacy of  xxxd2855xxx  has not
been demonstrated in patients with adipocytic
sts or gist.
drugs 2012; 72 (16)

adis drug profile:  xxxd2855xxx 

on the basis of the tolerability profile of  xxxd2855xxx , monitoring of certain clinical parameters, including hepatic function, thyroid function,
bp, ecg and electrolytes, is recommended.[10,11]
hepatic function should be monitored before
starting  xxxd2855xxx  and then at least once every
4 weeks during the initial â€¡4 months of therapy,
with periodic monitoring thereafter; elevated hepatic enzyme levels may require  xxxd2855xxx  therapy
to be interrupted, reduced in dosage or discontinued.[10,11]  xxxd2855xxx  dosage adjustments/alternatives may be required in some patients with
hepatic impairment, and the drug is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (section 2).[10,11]
use of  xxxd2855xxx  is not recommended in patients who have had haemoptysis,[10,11] cerebral
or clinically significant gastrointestinal haemorrhage[10,11] or an arterial thrombotic event[10] in
the last 6 months, and requires caution in some
patients, including those who have a history of or
are at risk of qt prolongation,[10,11] have cardiac
disease,[10,11] are at risk of arterial thrombotic
events or gastrointestinal perforation/fistula[10,11]
or have a significant risk of haemorrhage.[11] it is
also recommended that patients are monitored
for signs or symptoms of some conditions, including chf,[10,11] vte[10] and infections.[10]
local prescribing information should be consulted for detailed information regarding potential
drug interactions, use in special patient populations, dosage modifications, warnings and other
precautions.
7.  xxxd2855xxx : current status in
advanced soft tissue sarcoma
oral  xxxd2855xxx  is indicated in the us for the
treatment of advanced sts in patients who have
received prior chemotherapy[10] and in the eu for
use in adults with select subtypes of advanced
sts who have received prior chemotherapy for
metastatic disease or have progressed within 12
months of neoadjuvant therapy.[11] the drug has
also recently been approved for a similar indication in japan.[12]

pfs Â»3-fold relative to placebo in adults with
progressive metastatic sts following standard
chemotherapy. such benefit was observed irrespective of whether the tumour was low/intermediate
or high grade and irrespective of tumour histology (among the histological subtypes evaluated
in the study).  xxxd2855xxx  was not associated with
a statistically significant overall survival benefit.
the drug generally had no detrimental effect on
hr-qol and had an acceptable tolerability
profile.
