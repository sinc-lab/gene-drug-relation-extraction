1. introduction
 xxxd1682xxx  is metabolized into the hormonally active form,
1␣,25- xxxd408xxx  (1), via 25-hydroxyvitamin d3 (2)
which is the most abundant circulating metabolite (fig. 1) [1–3].
introduction of the 1␣-hydroxyl group into 25-hydroxyvitamin d3
(2) to produce 1␣,25- xxxd408xxx  (1) increases the  xxxg2412xxx  (vdr) binding afﬁnity by approximately 1000-fold.
several enzymes, including  xxxg580xxx  and  xxxg581xxx , strictly regulate formation and degradation of the most active metabolite 1,
depending upon serum calcium concentration [4].
most actions of 1 as well as its fellow metabolites are mediated via a ligand-inducible transcription factor, vdr, belonging to
the nuclear receptor super-family. binding mode of ligands to vdr,
as well as the stability of the complex, is now a focus of interest
for chemists, because formation of the ligand–receptor complex
triggers the whole sequential reactions, in  xxxd1682xxx -responsive
gene activation and/or suppression, resulting in speciﬁc biological
responses.
the x-ray crystal structures of human vdr in complex with 1
and its analogues show that each of the three hydroxyl groups at

positions c1, c3 and  xxxd1102xxx  makes hydrogen bonds with two amino
acid residues in the ligand-binding domain (lbd) of vdr (fig. 2)
[5,6]. in particular, together with ser-237, the 1␣-hydroxyl group
in 1 makes hydrogen bonds with arg-274, single mutation of which
results in impaired ligand recognition [7]. in return, the importance
of the 1␣-hydroxyl group over the other hydroxyl groups at position c3 and  xxxd1102xxx  in the seco-steroid structure has been demonstrated
by the data of a-ring diastereomers of 1 [4,8,9]. in comparison
with the case of the 3-hydroxyl group, epimerization or loss of the
hydroxyl group at position c1 severely affects the vdr afﬁnity.
in 2002, lithocholic acid (3: lca) and 3-ketolithocholic acid (4),
which possess a carboxyl group at position c24, were demonstrated to be weak vdr ligands [10]. although acylation at the
3-hydroxyl group in 3 increased the potency, the transformation of
the 24-carboxylic acid in lca 3 into its methyl, ethyl or benzyl ester
decreased the potency of the vdr activation, which suggested the
importance of the free carboxylic acid to be recognized by vdr [11].
we envisioned that the carboxylic acid of 3, instead of the hydroxyl
group, could make interaction with the critical arg-274 in the lbd
of vdr. in view of the signiﬁcance of arg-274 to direct the 1␣hydroxyl group in  xxxd1682xxx  compounds, as well as the results with
lithocholic acid derivatives, we designed the c2 modiﬁed analogues
of 25-hydroxyvitamin d3 (2) having a carboxyl group, instead of
the 1-hydroxyl group, for better electrostatic interaction to the
guanidinium side-chain of arginine (fig. 3). novel vdr ligands, 2␣carboxy-25-hydroxyvitamin d3 (5) as well as its methyl ester (6),
as a reference compound of 5, have been synthesized (fig. 4).

and ser-237.

instead of the 1␣-hydroxyl group could interact the guanidinium side-chain of

2. results and discussion
synthesis of 2␣-carboxy-25-hydroxyvitamin d3 (5) and its
methyl ester (6) has been carried out by a convergent method using
a palladium catalyst [12]. scheme 1 depicts the retrosynthetic analysis of the novel vdr ligands (5, 6) (scheme 1). separate synthesis
of the requisite a-ring enyne precursor 7 and the cd-ring portion 8,
followed by coupling of the two units, produced the targeted compounds. nine-step conversion of the known epoxide 9 prepared
from 3-buten-1-ol 10 yielded the requisite a-ring enyne precursors of 6, which was then converted to 5 by hydrolysis. detailed
synthetic procedures will be published elsewhere soon.
preliminary testing of the novel vdr ligands (5, 6) showed
weak afﬁnity to bovine thymus vdr in comparison with
1␣,25- xxxd408xxx  (1), however their potencies were
comparable to 25-hydroxyvitamin d3 (2). under the conditions that
we employed, lithocholic acid 3 itself exhibited low vdr afﬁnity;
our novel compounds showed more than 100-fold better binding
to vdr in comparison with 3.
in summary, we have designed novel vdr ligands introduced
a carboxyl group into the a-ring of the seco-steroid to interact the
critical amino acid residue, arg-274 in the lbd of vdr. synthesis
of the compounds was carried out by a convergent method using
palladium catalyst. novel vdr ligands showed comparable vdr
binding afﬁnities to vdr in comparison with 25-hydroxyvitamin
d3 .
