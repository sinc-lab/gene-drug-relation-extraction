background and objectives:  xxxd383xxx  is a racemic mixture of s(⫺)- and r(⫹)-enantiomers. both isomers have similar potency as local anesthetics, but the s(⫺)-enantiomer produces less central nervous system
and cardiovascular toxicity. local anesthetic-induced convulsion is likely to be associated with not only sodium
channel but also ligand-gated ion channel. the present study investigates the direct effects of the stereoenantiomers of  xxxd383xxx  on 4 recombinant ligand-gated ion-channel receptors.
methods: the antagonist activities of the s(⫺)- and r(⫹)-enantiomers of  xxxd383xxx  were tested at the
nicotinic acetylcholine, n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda), ␥-aminobutyric acida (gabaa), and 5-hydroxytryptamine3a
( xxxg1116xxx ) receptors expressed in xenopus oocytes using a 2-voltage clamp technique.
results: racemic  xxxd383xxx  and its 2 enantiomers all antagonized the 4 receptors in a concentration-dependent
manner. potencies at nicotinic acetylcholine, nmda, and  xxxg1116xxx  receptors were similar. at gabaa receptors, the
potency of r(⫹)- xxxd383xxx  was less than racemic  xxxd383xxx  or  xxxd2468xxx .
conclusions: comparison of the antagonist potencies with local concentrations obtained in clinical use
suggests that  xxxd383xxx  and its enantiomers are likely to produce extensive inhibition at the nicotinic
acetylcholine, nmda, and  xxxg1116xxx  receptors but a much weaker and probably not clinically relevant effect at the
gabaa receptor. it is possible that direct effects at these receptors may contribute, at least in part, to the spinal
and epidural anesthesia induced by these compounds. it is unlikely, however, that the difference of the toxicity
in  xxxd383xxx  enantiomers is because of the stereoselectivities of  xxxd383xxx  at ligand-gated ion-channel
receptors studied. reg anesth pain med 2006;31:19-25.

central nervous system, such as convulsions, and cardiovascular system than r(⫹)- xxxd383xxx .1-4 this
may be mainly associated with the stereoselectivities
of  xxxd383xxx  for the sodium channel.1,2 pharmacological studies have shown, however, that cocaine-induced seizures were efficiently inhibited by ␥-aminobutyric acida (gabaa) receptor agonists, n-methyl-daspartate (nmda) receptor antagonists, and dopamine
receptor agonists and antagonists, whereas sodium
and calcium channel blockers were ineffective.5
this suggests that local anesthetic (la)-induced
convulsion may result not only from the modulation of sodium channel but also from multiple factors. indeed, convulsions do not only result from
sodium channel function but also involve  xxxg1232xxx , dopamine, acetycholine, gaba,
nmda, and 5-hydroxytryptamine3a ( xxxg1116xxx ) receptors.3,5-10 although the stereoselectivities of  xxxd383xxx  for voltage-gated ion channel have been
well studied,3 the stereoselectivity of their interac-

tion at ligand-gated ion-channel (lgic) receptors is
still unknown.
in the present study, we have tested the hypothesis that the difference in toxicity between the 2
 xxxd383xxx  enantiomers may be because of the
stereoselectivities of  xxxd383xxx  at lgic receptors.
we have investigated the direct effects of the stereoenantiomers of  xxxd383xxx  on 4 recombinant lgic
receptors, namely, the nicotinic acetylcholine (nach),
nmda, gabaa,  xxxg1116xxx  receptors, and expressed
xenopus oocytes using a two-voltage clamp technique.

methods
preparation of messenger rnas for gabaa,
nmda, nach, and  xxxg1116xxx  receptors
experiments were performed as described previously.11-13 mouse complementary dna (cdnas)
encoding ␣1, ␤2, and ␥2s subunits of the gabaa
receptor and human cdnas encoding  xxxg1116xxx  receptor
were subcloned into the transcription vector, modified pbluescript (qiagen, chatworth, ca). mouse cdnas encoding ⑀1, ␰1 subunits of the nmda receptor
were subcloned into the transcription vector psp35t.
human cdnas encoding ␣4, ␤2 subunits of the  xxxg456xxx  (nachr) were subcloned
into the transcription vector psp64.
for the breeding of the cdna, cdnas into the
transcription vector were transformed in escherichia
coli as plasmid cdnas and incubated. the multiple
cloning site of vectors were flanked by ␤-globulin of
xenopus laevis to facilitate stable messenger rna
(mrna) expression in oocytes. plasmid cdnas
were extracted from e coli, purified using the qiagen plasmid kit, and resuspended in sterile water.
the cloned dnas were confirmed to be coding for
their respective subunits by the pattern of fragments produced after digestion with restriction enzymes. each cdnas template was linearized by restriction enzymes (wako, osaka, japan) (bgl i for
␤2 of the gabaa receptor, pvu i for ␣4 of the
nachr, pvu ii for ␤2 of the nachr and ␣1, and ␥2s
of the gabaa receptor, not i for ␰1 subunit of the
nmda receptor, ecor i for ⑀1 subunit of the nmda
receptor and  xxxg1116xxx  receptor). capped mrnas
were synthesized by t3 rna message machine kit
for ␣1, ␤2, and ␥2s subunits of the gabaa receptor
and  xxxg1116xxx  (ambion, austin, tx) and by sp6 rna
message machine kit for ␰1 and ⑀1 subunits of the
nmda receptor and ␣4, ␤2 subunits of the nachr
(ambion, austin, tx) following the manufacturer’s
recommended protocol. mrna was stored in
rnase-free water at ⫺80°c until use.

oocyte expression
in accordance with a study protocol approved by
the animal research committee of osaka university medical school (osaka, japan), female xenopus
laevis were anesthetized on ice with 1% 3-aminobenzoic ethyl ester (tricaine) (sigma, st louis,
mo). the xenopus laevis were usually sacrificed after
use, although sometimes they were used again after
an interval of at least 10 days in the case of good
oocytes. oocytes were harvested via a laparotomy
incision, manually defolliculated with forceps, and
treated with 1.5 mg/ml collagenase type 1a (sigma)
for 30 minutes at room temperature in modified
barth’s saline (mbs) (composition in mmol/l: nacl
88, kcl 1, hepes 10, nahco3 2.4, ph 7.4). between 10 and 50 ng crna was injected into each
oocyte with a glass capillary, using a nanoject injector (drummond scientific, broomall, pa). prepared oocytes were incubated at 20°c in mbs containing 1.8 mmol/l ca2⫹ until the start of the
electrophysiological experiment.
electrophysiology and drug application
between 24 and 48 hours after crna injection, the
oocytes were placed in a 0.2-ml chamber and were
continuously superfused with mbs (in mmol/l: nacl
88, kcl 1,  xxxd2534xxx  0.82, hepes 10, nahco3 2.4, ph
7.4 with cacl2 1.8 for gabaa,  xxxg1116xxx , and nachr
or bacl2 1.8 for the nmda receptor). the electrophysiological recordings were made using a 2-electrode voltage-clamp technique. the oocytes were
impaled with 1 to 5 m⍀ electrodes filled with 3
mol/l kcl solution and voltage clamped at ⫺70 mv
(cez-1250; nihon kohden, tokyo, japan). drugs
were dissolved in mbs and applied to the superfusate.
drug solutions were administered by switching
3-way stopcocks from mbs containing cacl2 or
bacl2 to an otherwise identical solution containing
the test drug at the desired concentration. drugcontaining solutions were superfused for at least 20
seconds at the peak current. the correct receptor
expression was confirmed by blocking these currents with 10⫺4 mol/l mg2⫹ and 10⫺5 mol/l mk801 for the nmda receptor and the selective 5-ht3
receptor antagonist ramosetron (10⫺8 mol/l) for the
 xxxg1116xxx  receptor; 10⫺5 mol/l bicuculline and 10⫺5
mol/l  xxxd2947xxx  for the gabaa receptor; and 10⫺7
mol/l dh␤e for the nachr, respectively (data not

receptor, and acetylcholine 1 ␮mol/l (ec50) for the
nach receptor were separated by intervals of at
least 5 minutes drug-free superfusion. at high concentrations, intervals of at least 10 minutes were
used to ensure resolution of receptor desensitization. competition experiments were carried out
with a triple application. first, the agonist was administered alone as a control. after 5 minutes, the
agonist was applied together with the test drug.
finally, the agonist alone was administered again to

check that the same level of response as the initial
control was obtained. the absence of cumulative
desensitization was ensured by confirming that the
same response was induced by a low concentration
of agonist throughout an experiment with a single
oocyte. the currents were digitally recorded with
axoscope software (axon instruments, burlingame, ca) running on an ibm personal computer
(ibm, new york, ny). all electrophysiological experiments were performed at room temperature.

data analysis
peak amplitudes of the current elicited by the
drugs were measured directly from digital recordings stored by axoscope. to obtain concentrationresponse curves for agonist-induced currents and
the concentration-current inhibition of the tested
compounds, observed peak amplitudes were normalized and plotted. data were then fitted to the
following hill equation using sigmaplot (jandel scientific, san rafael, ca) software:
n
i ⫽ imax ⁄ (1 ⫹ (ec50
⁄ [agonist])n)

where i is the peak current at a given concentration
of agonist, imax is the maximum current, ec50 is
the concentration of agonist eliciting a half-maximum response, and n denotes the hill coefficient,
which was allowed to float as is customary.11-14 all
data are expressed as mean values with 95% confidence intervals (cis). statistical analysis was performed using a 2-tailed t test, 2-factor analysis of
variance, or the tukey-kramer method, with p ⬍
.05 indicating significance.
chemicals
racemic  xxxd383xxx ,  xxxd2468xxx , and
r(⫹)- xxxd383xxx  were donated by maruishi pharmaceutical co, ltd (osaka, japan). 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht), gaba, acetylcholine, glycine,
nmda,  xxxd2947xxx , dihydro-␤-erythroidine, and
bicuculline were purchased from wako (osaka, japan). the selective 5-ht3 antagonist, ramosetron,
was donated by yamanouchi pharmaceutical co,
ltd (tokyo, japan). all drugs were dissolved in
mbs on the day of the experiment.

results
the effects of racemic  xxxd383xxx ,  xxxd2468xxx , and r(⫹)- xxxd383xxx  were measured on
agonist-induced currents using lgic receptors expressed in xenopus oocytes. the application of the
local anesthetics to oocytes expressing lgic receptors, in the absence of agonist, did not generate any
measurable currents. agonist-induced currents were
reversibly inhibited by the local anesthetics in a concentration-dependent manner at all of the receptors
studied (figs 1 and 2). table 1 summarizes halfmaximum inhibitory concentration (ic50) and hill
coefficients of the local anesthetics at the receptors
studied. hill coefficients were greater than 1 at
nmda and  xxxg1116xxx  receptor and less than 1 at
gabaa and nach receptor. the racemate and the 2
enantiomers antagonized the nmda,  xxxg1116xxx , and
nach receptors in the concentration range of 50 to
1,500 ␮mol/l (equivalent to 1.6%-48%), whereas

inhibition of the gabaa receptor required concentrations in excess of 10 mmol/l (equivalent to
325%). at nmda,  xxxg1116xxx , and nach receptors, although  xxxd383xxx  was significantly weaker than its
2 enantiomers at a 200 ␮mol/l concentration of
 xxxg1116xxx  receptor, the racemate and its 2 enantiomers
showed significantly similar sensitivity. while at the
gabaa receptor, the ic50 and inhibition  xxxd1891xxx ,000
␮mol/l of r(⫹)- xxxd383xxx  were significantly
weaker than  xxxd2468xxx  or racemic  xxxd383xxx  analyzed with the t test and tukey-kramer
method, respectively.
a difference of less than 4-fold in the affinity for
the gabaa receptor has thus been shown to be
statistically significant. because the experimental
variables are similar for all of the receptors tested, it
can be assumed that the “minimal detectable difference” is at least of this dimension.

discussion
the present study shows that  xxxd383xxx  and its
stereoisomers can directly antagonize nach, nmda,
 xxxg1116xxx , and gabaa receptors in a concentrationdependent manner. the inhibitory effects of racemic  xxxd383xxx  and its stereo enantiomers were
similar at nach, nmda, and  xxxg1116xxx  receptors. at
gabaa receptors, however, the inhibitory effect of
r(⫹)- xxxd383xxx  was weaker than racemic  xxxd383xxx  and  xxxd2468xxx .
soon after direct spinal injection, local anesthetics can reach concentrations of 10⫺4 mol/l to 10⫺3
mol/l (equivalent to 3.25%-32.5%) in the spinal
cord.15,16 the antagonist potencies of  xxxd383xxx 
and its enantiomers at the nach, nmda, and
 xxxg1116xxx  receptors suggest, therefore, that they may
produce extensive antagonism of these receptors in
clinical use. in view of their lower antagonist potency at the gabaa receptor, however, it is unlikely that the activity at this receptor is modified by
these compounds when used clinically. thus, in
addition to the effects on voltage-gated sodium,
potassium, and calcium channels,17 direct antagonism of  xxxg1116xxx , nmda, and nach receptors in the
spinal cord may contribute to their clinical effects.12
indeed, there is considerable evidence that lgic
receptors such as 5-ht3 receptors,18 nmda receptors,19 and nach receptors20 may be involved in the
control of pain. the similar inhibitory effect of  xxxd383xxx  and its enantiomers at  xxxg1116xxx , nmda,
and nach receptors is consistent with the similar
analgesia efficacy of  xxxd383xxx  enantiomers with
intrathecal4 and epidural21 anesthesia.
in contrast, it is unlikely that interaction at the
lgic receptors studied is involved in convulsions
sometimes caused by local anesthetics such as bu-

pivacaine.22 convulsions are associated with activation or potentiation of nmda receptors,8 whereas
the  xxxd383xxx  and its enantiomers were antagonists at the nmda receptor. although antagonism
of the gabaa receptor is associated with convulsions,7 the direct affinity of  xxxd383xxx  and its
enantiomers for the gabaa receptor in this study is
too low for clinically relevant concentrations to produce an extensive antagonism of the gabaa receptor. because local anesthetics have also been shown
to possess anticonvulsant properties at subtoxic blood
levels,23 the antagonism of  xxxd383xxx  and its enantiomers at the nmda receptor is likely to be associated with anticonvulsant properties. although concentrations of local anesthetics in the brain have
been shown to be approximately 5-fold higher than
in blood,24 these concentrations are still too low for

any significant action at gabaa receptors. although there is a report that the inhibition of both
glycine and gabaa receptor functions by local anesthetic in the central nervous system contributes
to convulsions,25 convulsions induced by local anesthetic associated with gabaa receptor need to be
further investigated.13
increased sensitivity to agonist-induced seizures
has been reported in knock-in mice carrying hypersensitive ␣4 nicotinic receptors.6 the 5-ht3 agonist
(m-cpbg) also increased the duration of fully kindled model seizures,9 whereas the 5-ht3 antagonist
mdl-7222 exacerbated the severity of ethanol
withdrawal seizures in mice.10 because the inhibitory effect of  xxxd383xxx  and its enantiomers was
similar for clinically relevant concentrations at the
 xxxg1116xxx  and nach receptor, convulsions are un-

likely to be associated with the  xxxg1116xxx  and nach
receptor stereoselectivity.
because  xxxd383xxx  and its 2 enantiomers
showed similar antagonism of nmda,  xxxg1116xxx , and
nach receptors and lower antagonist potency at
the gabaa receptor, our hypothesis that the difference of the toxicity in  xxxd383xxx  enantiomers is
because of the stereoselectivities of  xxxd383xxx  at
lgic receptors is not supported by this result. however, because we examined only putative recombinant lgic subunits in the central nervous system,
other combinations of lgic receptor subunits and
indirect effect should be evaluated.
in conclusion, the affinity of  xxxd383xxx  at the
nach, nmda, and  xxxg1116xxx  receptors in comparison
with concentrations achieved clinically suggests
that interactions at these receptors could play a role
in their local anesthetic effect. there is, however,
no stereoselectivity of their affinity at the receptors
studied, and the improved tolerance of the s(⫺)enantiomer is unlikely to involve interactions at
nach, nmda, and  xxxg1116xxx  receptors. although
there is a stereoselectivity of  xxxd383xxx  for
gabaa receptors, the affinities are too low for these
receptors to play any role in the toxicity of the local
anesthetic.
