5-fluorouracil (5-fu) based therapy is part of the standard
therapy for colorectal (crc) and breast cancer. in order to
exert its cytotoxic effect, 5-fu has to be activated to its
monophosphate form, fdump. fdump is a strong irreversible inhibitor of  xxxg2366xxx  (ts) by forming a stable
ternary complex. in its triphosphate forms, futp and
fdutp, 5-fu can be incorporated into the rna and dna,

orin has increased survival,2 but resistance is often encountered. 5-fu-resistance is related to a decreased level of 5-fuactivating enzymes, including  xxxd2794xxx  phosphoribosyl-transferase and  xxxg2372xxx ,3 and an increased expression of the
target ts.4 recent improvements have been made by replacing bolus injections and inconvenient continuous infusions
by oral ﬂuoropyrimidine formulations, such as xeloda ( xxxd425xxx ) and uft.5 another type of oral formulation, tas102, has recently been introduced into the clinic and consists
of triﬂuorothymidine (tft), in combination with a speciﬁc
inhibitor of  xxxg2365xxx  (tp), tpi. tas-102, is
currently tested in phase ii studies against colorectal and
gastric cancer.6 similar to 5-fu, tft can inhibit ts in its
monophosphate form (tf-tmp),7 however tft does not
form a ternary complex as for 5-fu, but binds covalently to
the active site of ts, thereby inhibiting its activity.8,9 murakami et al. showed that tft is active in colorectal cancer
cells with (acquired) 5-fu and/or  xxxd2117xxx  resistance caused by
ampliﬁcation and subsequent overexpression of ts,10 suggesting differences in their modes of action. when further activated to its tri-phosphate form, tft can be incorporated
into the dna,11,12 which results in dna damage13 and subsequent cell death induction. tft is not dependent on p53
to be active14 and can induce an arrest in the g2/m-phase of
the cell cycle.15 on the other hand, 5-fu induces an arrest in

cancer therapy

 xxxd3434xxx  (tft) is part of the oral drug formulation tas-102. both 5-fluorouracil (5-fu) and tft can inhibit thymidylate
synthase and be incorporated into dna. tft shows only moderate cross-resistance to 5-fu. therefore, we examined whether
mechanistic differences in cell death could underlie their different modes of action in colorectal cancer cell lines (widr,
lovo92 and colo320). drug cytotoxicity was determined by srb- and clonogenic assays, cell death by flow cytometry (pi and
 xxxg166xxx ), caspase cleavage by western blotting and activity assays and in vivo activity in the hollow fiber assay. the ic50
values of tft were 1-6 fold lower than for 5-fu, and clonogenic survival was less than 0.9% at 3 lm tft, while 2–20% of the
cells still survived after 20 lm 5-fu. in general, tft was a more potent inducer of apoptosis than 5-fu, although the
contribution of caspases varied between the used cell lines and necrosis-like cell death was detected. accordingly, both drugs
induced caspase (z-vad) independent cell death and lysosomal  xxxg548xxx  was involved. activation of autophagy recovery
mechanisms was only triggered by 5-fu, but not by tft as determined by lc3b expression and cleavage. inhibition of
autophagy by 3-ma in 5-fu exposed cells reduced cell survival. also, in vivo tft (as tas-102) caused more cell death than a
5-fu formulation. we conclude that tft and 5-fu induce cell death via both caspase-dependent and independent mechanisms.
the tft was more potent than 5-fu, because it induces higher levels of cell death and does not elicit an autophagic survival
response in the cancer cell lines. this provides a strong molecular basis for further application of tft in cancer therapy.

tft vs. 5-fu: cell death and autophagy

cancer therapy

2458

the g1/s-phase of cell cycle and cytotoxicity appeared to be
more dependent on p53, although there is some controversy
on this issue.4,16,17 moreover, the enzymatic activation route
of these drugs is different, since 5-fu is a uracil analog and
tft a thymidine analog. taken together, these mechanistic
differences between tft and 5-fu may contribute to the
circumvention of resistance.
the failure of anticancer drugs to induce cell death may
contribute to the development of drug resistance. two classical apoptotic cell death pathways have been identiﬁed; the extrinsic (death receptor) and intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway,
although cross-talk between these and other pathways have
been described.18,19 the extrinsic pathway is activated upon
binding of ligands to death receptors, such as tumor necrosis
factor (tnf),  xxxg2303xxx  treatment (trail) or fas ligands.20,21 this will lead to the cleavage and activation of initiator caspases 8 and 10 which in turn
cleave and activate executioner caspases 3, 6, and 7, leading to
apoptosis. the intrinsic pathway is activated when cytochrome
c is released from the mitochondria. subsequently,  xxxg169xxx  will
form the apoptosome with  xxxd1148xxx  and procaspase-9, leading to
caspase 9 activation followed by the activation of the executioner caspases 3, 6, and 7. the extrinsic pathway is able to
cross-activate the intrinsic pathway via  xxxg342xxx -dependent
activation of bid that can induce mitochondrial disruption via
interactions with other  xxxg250xxx  family members, bax and bak.
cytotoxic agents that inhibit ts activity can induce cell death
via the extrinsic pathway,22 after which the intrinsic pathway
can be cross-activated.23 on the other hand, dna damaging
agents are often found to activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway via activation of p53.
tft and 5-fu can inhibit both ts and induce dna damage, but the different resistance proﬁles suggest different
modes of action that may involve differences in cell death
activation. caspases are well established as main players in
apoptosis, however, other proteases such as cathepsins and
calpains may also be involved in activation of alternative
routes of cell death. cathepsins, in particular  xxxg548xxx ,
can act as the main executor of caspase-independent cell
death induced by  xxxg2296xxx  in several systems.24,25 it has
become evident that these caspase-independent cell
death pathways are important in cell death induction
after chemotherapy, including induced by microtubule-interacting agents.24 another process important in life-death decisions is autophagy. autophagy is a (reversible) state of the
cell that involves a degradative lysosomal pathway and is
known to enhance cell survival under conditions of nutrient
starvation and other detrimental conditions, including
chemotherapy.26,27
insight in the molecular mechanisms mediating drug cytotoxicity can facilitate the identiﬁcation of biological markers
to predict drug response and/ or to the rationalized design of
improved therapy. therefore, in this study we explored
whether differences in the mode of cell death activation,
including autophagy, are at the basis of the differential

activity between tft and 5-fu in human colon cancer cell
lines.

material and methods
cell lines and chemicals

human colon carcinoma cell lines colo320 (wt p53, but
impaired pathway),28 widr (p53 mutant),23 lovo92 (wt
p53),29 were cultured as monolayers in dmem supplemented
with 10% heat inactivated fcs and 20 mm hepes. cells were
maintained in a humidiﬁed 5% co2 atmosphere at 37 c.
tft was provided by taiho pharmaceuticals co. ltd.
(tokushima, japan). z-vad-fmk, ietd-fmk, ledh-fmk
were obtained from bachem (weil am rhein, germany) and
 xxxd1032xxx  was obtained from peptide institute inc. (osaka,
japan). these inhibitors were used in previously reported
non-toxic concentrations.23,31 3-methyladenine (3-ma;
sigma-aldrich chemicals, zwijndrecht, the netherlands) is
an autophagy inhibitor, which was used in a 3 mm concentration, reported by others to inhibit autophagy.32
drug cytotoxicity assays

drug cytotoxicity was determined using the sulforhodamine
b (srb)-assay. cells were seeded in 96-wells plates (greiner
bio-one, frickenhausen, germany) at 5000 cells/ well. after
24 h enabling attachment, cells were exposed to increasing
concentrations of drugs for 72 h. thereafter, cells were ﬁxed
with trichloroacetic acid (tca) for 1 h at 4 c, colored with
srb and analyzed as described previously.33 optical density
was measured at 540 nm. ic50 and ic80 values were determined from graphs.
clonogenic assay

cell survival was determined by the clonogenic assay.34
depending on drug concentration, 150–5000 cells were
seeded in 6 wells plates (greiner bio-one). after 72 h drug
exposure, drug containing medium was replaced by drug free
medium (dfm). after 8 days of growth, clones were ﬁxed in
formaldehyde (3.7 %) and stained with 10% giemsa. colonies
containing 50 or more cells were counted and corrected for
the plating efﬁciency (pe), after which the surviving fraction
(sf) was calculated. the ratio between the sf at 0.1 (10%) of
tft and 5-fu was calculated by dividing the concentration
of 5-fu to obtain a sf of 0.1 through that concentration of
tft.
western blotting

western blot was performed as described previously35. from
each condition 60 lg of protein was separated on a 12%
sds-page gel and electroblotted onto polyvinylidenediﬂuoride (pvdf) membranes (millipore corp., billerica, ma).
subsequently, the membranes were blocked for 1 h at room
temperature (rt) in tbs-tween (tbst) with 5% milk and
incubated overnight (o/n) at 4 c with the primary antibodies;35 anti- xxxg341xxx , anti- xxxg342xxx , anti-caspase 9, anticleaved  xxxg341xxx , lc3b, parp (all from cell signaling

fluorimetric assay for caspase activity

 xxxg341xxx  like activity was determined using a spectroﬂuorimetric assay for proteolytic cleavage of ﬂuorogenic devdafc substrates (clontech laboratories, inco, palo alto,
ca).36 experiments were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. fluorescence was detected at 400 nm
excitation and 505 nm emission (spectra ﬂuor tecan, salzburg, austria). relative caspase activity was calculated in
ﬂuorescence units/106 cells/h.
cell death analysis

cell death was analyzed using facs analysis as described
previously.15 in brief, 100,000–200,000 cells were seeded in
6-wells plates. after treatment with tft or 5-fu, cells were
trypsinized, resuspended in medium collected from the
matching sample containing the dead cells, and centrifuged
for 5 min at 1200 rpm. subsequently, cells were stained with
 xxxd3027xxx  iodide (pi) buffer (0.1 mg/ml pi, 0.1%  xxxg1963xxx )
in dark on ice. dna content of the cells was analyzed by ﬂuorescence activated cell sorting (facscan, becton dickinson
immunocytometry systems, san jose, ca, usa) with an acquisition of 10,000 events. the sub-g1 peak was used as indication of the percentage cell death induction. for discriminating apoptotic from the necrotic fraction, living cells were
stained with  xxxg166xxx -fitc and pi (#apoaf apoptosis
detection kit, sigma-aldrich chemicals) directly after exposure to ic80 concentrations of tft or 5-fu for 24, 48, and
72 h. according to the manufacturers’ instructions, annexin
v positive cells were deﬁned as early apoptotic cells, and cells
positive for both  xxxg166xxx  and pi were deﬁned necrotic.
immunoﬂuorescent staining

immunoﬂuorescent staining was performed according to
manufacturer’s instructions. in brief, cells were seeded in 6wells plates on a cover slip and exposed to ic80 concentrations of tft or 5-fu. after 72 h exposure, cells were ﬁxed
for 15 min in 4% formaldehyde and permeabilized with
methanol for 10 min at 20 c. subsequently, cells were

blocked and the lc3b antibody was added (1:200, cell signaling; o/n at 4 c), after which the secondary antibody goat
anti rabbit conjugated with alexa fluor was added together
with hoechst 33342 (1:800) for 1 h at rt. the coverslips
were mounted onto microscope slides using vectashield
(vector, burlingame, ca, usa). fluorescence microscopy
was carried out using an inverted leica dmirb/e ﬂuorescence microscope (leica cambridge, cambridge, uk). images
were collected using q500mc quantimet software v01.01
(leica cambridge).
hollow ﬁber assay

in order to evaluate the activity of the drugs in vivo, the hollow ﬁber assay was performed as described previously.37 the
protocol was approved by the local animal ethical committee in accordance with the ukccr guidelines. in brief,
colo320 cells (7.5106 cells/ml) were transplanted into a 2
cm hollow ﬁber in balb/c mice. the ﬁbers were 24 h preincubated in culture medium prior to transplantation. three
ﬁbers were transplanted in the ﬂank of each mouse. since
tft and 5-fu have a poor bioavailability, we used tft as
the formulation tas-102 and 5-fu as the prodrug 50 dfur
(50 -deoxy-5-ﬂuorouridine). mice were treated on day 3 with
tas-102 or 50 dfur at their maximum tolerable dose
(mtd) by oral administration. the mice were sacriﬁced by
co2 inhalation at day 10 and the ﬁbers were collected. cells
were retrieved and growth inhibition was determined by the
mtt-assay and cell death by the tunel assay as described
previously.37
statistical analysis

potential differences between tft and 5-fu were evaluated
using the two-tailed student’s t-test for paired data. changes
were considered signiﬁcantly different when p < 0.05.

results
tft and 5-fu induced cytotoxicity

the cytotoxicity of tft and 5-fu was examined in a panel
of colon cancer cell lines (see table 1). tft had an equal or
up to 6.6 fold lower ic50 value than 5-fu in the colorectal
cancer cell lines as determined by the srb-assay (table 1).
for both tft and 5-fu, no relationship was found between
p53 status and cytotoxicity.
next, the clonogenic assay was performed to study the
effects of the tft and 5-fu treatment on the long term, and
to allow the detection of multiple cytotoxic effects, including
different types of cell death (e.g., apoptosis, necrosis) and of
irreversible growth inhibition (senescence). after tft exposure, the clonogenic cell survival was much lower than
observed after 5-fu exposure in all tested colon cancer cell
lines (fig. 1a). in order to achieve a surviving fraction of 0.1
(sf 0.1), a 4.7 to more than 30 fold lower concentration of
tft was required compared to 5-fu. this indicates that
tft has a stronger antitumor activity than 5-fu in these
cancer cells. for further experiments, we selected three cell

1 h with the primary antibody against b-actin (sigma-aldrich
chemicals; 1:10,000 in 5% bsa). the membrane was washed
5 times in tbst and incubated with the secondary antibody
(1:2000 goat-a-mouse-hrp or goat-a-rabbit-hrp, dako
cytomation, glostrup, denmark) in tbst (with 2 % milk)
for 1 h at rt. after incubation, the membrane was washed
in tbst and developed using enhanced chemoluminiscence
(ecl-plus and ecl for b-actin; amersham pharmacia biotech, roosendaal, the netherlands). the chemoluminescent
signal was detected using a hyperﬁlm (bio-rad laboratories,
veenendaal, the netherlands). digital scanning of the ﬁlm
was performed using versadoc system (versadoc 4000 imaging system, and quantity one software, bio-rad).

(impaired p53 pathway).
to examine cell death activation and recovery of cells after treatment with tft or 5-fu, pi stained cells were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry at various time points after culturing
cells in drug-free medium (fig. 1b). in this respect we chose
10 lm, a concentration at which cells do not survive after
tft exposure, while cells had a good survival after 5-fu. in
general, cells that were exposed to 5-fu displayed a lower
level of sub-g1 cell fraction representing death cells, than
seen after tft. furthermore, in particular in colo320 and
lovo92, cells seemed to recover from the cytotoxic insults
inﬂicted by 5-fu. this in contrast to tft treatment, after
which cells continued to die, displaying much less recovery.
widr cells, although showing higher levels of dead cells
after tft treatment showed apparently no or little recovery
after treatment with the selected drug concentration.

cancer therapy

tft and 5-fu induced cell death and caspase activation

to determine whether the difference in clonogenic survival
between tft and 5-fu was related to a different activation
of the two main apoptotic routes, the expression and cleavage
of a number of key caspases were determined (fig. 2a).
therefore, cells were exposed to equitoxic ic80 concentrations, as determined by the srb-assay, to induce detectable
amounts of cell death. widr, lovo92, and colo320 cells
expressed procaspase 9 and 3, whereas procaspase 8 was
expressed in widr and lovo92, but hardly detectable in
colo320 cells. in widr cells, caspases 8, 9, and 3 were
cleaved after 72 h tft exposure, whereas 5-fu exposure
triggered  xxxg342xxx  and 3 cleavage to some extent, but caspase 9 was hardly cleaved. in lovo92 cells  xxxg341xxx  and to
some extent  xxxg342xxx  were cleaved after tft and 5-fu
treatment, while no evidence of caspase 9 cleavage was
observed. in colo320 cells,  xxxg341xxx  was strongly cleaved,
and low levels of cleaved forms of caspases 9 were observed
after both tft and 5-fu exposure. the  xxxg341xxx  substrate
parp showed similar cleavage patterns as  xxxg341xxx , with
stronger cleavage detected after tft compared to 5-fu. in
lovo92 cells, parp cleavage was hardly detectable, which is
in agreement with the observed low cleavage-levels of the
caspases. in the western blots, generally, caspases and parp

cleavage after tft exposure was somewhat stronger than
after 5-fu, even though cells were exposed to equitoxic
concentrations.
to further monitor  xxxg341xxx  activation, an enzymatic activity assay was used. in widr cells,  xxxg341xxx  was strongly
activated after exposure to tft in a time dependent manner
(fig. 2b), while 5-fu showed only limited activation. in
lovo92 and colo320 cells, both tft and 5-fu induced comparable levels of  xxxg341xxx  activity that increased in time.
overall these results are in agreement with the  xxxg341xxx 
cleavage patterns detected in figure 2a, although the enzymatic activity assays appeared to be more sensitive for detecting active  xxxg341xxx .
to determine to what extent  xxxg342xxx  and 9 contributed
to the induction of cell death, cells were pre-treated with speciﬁc synthetic inhibitors (fig. 2c). in widr cells, inhibition
of  xxxg342xxx  with ietd, caspase 9 with ledh, and all caspases with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-vad, resulted in a
similar reduction of tft-induced cell death by approximately
50% and 5-fu induced cell death was decreased by 70%. in
lovo92 cells,  xxxg342xxx  appeared to be the major mediator of
cell death after exposure to both tft and 5-fu. this is in
agreement with the western blot, in which only cleaved  xxxg342xxx  was detected. in colo320 cells, caspase 9 inhibition
reduced tft induced cell death by 20%, while 5-fu induced
cell death was reduced by approximately 50 %.
furthermore, z-vad was able to reduce tft-induced cell
death as monitored by the sub-g1 fraction by approximately
45, 60 and 80% (fig. 2c). for 5-fu this reduction was
approximately 70, 15 and 95% in widr, colo320, and
lovo92, respectively. the incomplete inhibition predominantly found in widr and colo320 cells indicate that caspase independent mechanisms were also involved. in both
widr and lovo92 cells, z-vad was more effective in reducing 5-fu-induced cell killing, indicating that 5-fu cytotoxicity may be more dependent on caspase activation than tft.
involvement of  xxxg548xxx  in tft and 5-fu induced
cell death

the lysosomal protease  xxxg548xxx  is known to contribute
to caspase-independent cell death upon various stress stimuli,
including microtubule-interacting agents.24 therefore, we
explored the possible involvement of  xxxg548xxx  in tft and

both tft and 5-fu exposure resulted in cleavage of  xxxg548xxx  in a time dependent manner (fig 3a), although cleavage was only weakly detectable in colo320 cells. furthermore,

ietd (30 lm) and lehd (40 lm) after 72 h drug exposure. cell death induced by tft or 5-fu alone were set at 100%. values represent
means 6 sem of 3–4 independent experiments. signiﬁcant differences between tft/5-fu alone are indicated with * (p < 0.05).

cells, the induction of cell death by tft and 5-fu was hardly
inhibited after  xxxg548xxx  inhibition, which is in line with
the almost not detectable  xxxg548xxx  processing in these
cells in western blots (fig 3a). interestingly, in lovo92 cells,
inhibition of  xxxg548xxx  decreased in particular 5-fu
induced cell death by 75%, while a reduction of 40% was
seen after tft exposure. taken together, tft and 5-fu can
both activate  xxxg548xxx , although tft may be somewhat
more potent in this respect in some cell types (lovo92).
however, the contribution of  xxxg548xxx  in tft and 5-fuinduced cell death varied amongst the cell lines from almost
no effect in colo320 to approximately 75% in lovo92.

to determine the relationship between the activation of
caspases and  xxxg548xxx , cells were exposed to z-vad,
 xxxd1464xxx -me or both inhibitors prior to tft or 5-fu treatment, after which  xxxg548xxx  and  xxxg341xxx  cleavage were
determined (fig. 3c). in widr and lovo92 cells, z-vad prevented the cleavage of  xxxg341xxx , but did not block cathepsin
b processing.  xxxg548xxx  inhibition by  xxxd1464xxx -me resulted
in a strong decrease in a cleavage of both  xxxg548xxx  and
 xxxg341xxx  in lovo92 cells, whereas only  xxxg548xxx  was suppressed in widr cells. in colo320 cells, z-vad inhibited
 xxxg341xxx  cleavage, and as expected no role for  xxxg548xxx 
could be found. in lovo92 cells, both caspase-dependent

figure 3.  xxxg548xxx  and cell death activation by tft and 5-fu. (a),  xxxg548xxx  cleavage was determined by western blotting after
exposing cells to ic80 concentrations of the drugs. (b) effects on the  xxxg548xxx  inhibitor  xxxd1464xxx -me (10 lm) on cell death activation was
determined by facs (sub-g1). tft and 5-fu induced cell death was set at 100%. values represent means 6 sem of 3-4 independent

routes as well as  xxxg548xxx  activation could lead to caspase
3 cleavage. moreover, the hardly detectable levels of cathepsin
b processing in colo320 cells and lack of effect of  xxxd1464xxx -me
do not suggest an important role for this protease in this cell
line. together, these data indicate that in two of the three
cell lines,  xxxg548xxx  activation signiﬁcantly contributed to
tft and 5-fu-induced apoptosis.
apoptotic and necrotic cell death activation

 xxxg548xxx  cleavage has been linked with non-apoptotic
routes of cell death.24 therefore, the possible contribution of
necrotic cell death was analyzed in more detail using piannexin v staining (fig. 4). in widr cells, necrosis and apoptosis both contributed almost equally to the induction of
cell death by 5-fu. after tft exposure, the apoptotic fraction was somewhat more dominant compared to the necrotic
fraction. when z-vad was added, the apoptotic component
appeared to be suppressed, and the necrotic fraction was
somewhat increased.  xxxd1464xxx -me reduced both the apoptotic

and necrotic fractions after tft and 5-fu exposure. in
lovo92 cells, the largest portion of cells underwent apoptosis
after tft and 5-fu exposure. the increase in the necroticfraction during time may represent later stages of apoptosis,
where cells become somewhat permeable for pi. interestingly,
in lovo92 cells  xxxd1464xxx -me addition decreased the apoptotic
fraction after both tft and 5-fu exposure.  xxxd1464xxx -me
hardly affected the (low) necrotic fraction, indicating that  xxxg548xxx  may cross-activate caspases. for this, evidence was
also obtained in figure 3c. in colo320 cells, predominantly
necrosis was induced after tft and 5-fu exposure. although
fractions were to some extent decreased by z-vad or
 xxxd1464xxx -me, this is probably mediated by other pathway(s).
autophagy induction after 5-fu exposure

to further examine pathways involved in cell death regulation
by tft and 5-fu, we studied the ability of the drugs to activate autophagy. therefore, we determined the expression and
processing of lc3b, which is regarded as a key step in the

induction of autophagy.38 interestingly, western blots showed
that lc3b was strongly upregulated in widr, lovo92 and
colo320 cells after exposure to 5-fu, which was not seen after
tft treatment (fig. 5a). the cleaved form of lc3b was only
detectable in widr and lovo92 cells and not in colo320
cells. to conﬁrm that lc3b was located in vesicles, immunoﬂuorescent staining of lc3b was performed (fig. 5b). this
clearly shows that after 5-fu exposure, and not tft, lc3b is
highly expressed in autophagic vesicles in widr and lovo92
cells and to a lesser extent in colo320 cells.
finally, we determined whether inhibition of autophagy
by 3-ma could result in a decreased cell survival by preventing an autophagic recovery process. the three cell lines were

exposed to 1 lm tft or 10 lm 5-fu in the presence or absence of 3-ma, after which the clonogenic potential of the
cells was determined. we used a lower concentration of tft,
because after exposure to 10 lm no cells survived. 1 lm
tft had a comparable cytotoxicity to 10 lm 5-fu in this
assay. 3-ma did not affect the clonogenic survival in cells
exposed to 1 lm tft. on the other hand, 3-ma decreased
the cell survival after exposure to 10 lm 5-fu in widr,
lovo92 and colo320 cells, respectively (fig. 5c).
in vivo growth inhibition and cell death induction
finally, in order to determine whether tft was more potent
than 5-fu in an in vivo model, we used the hollow ﬁber

assay. this model allows the determination of growth inhibition and cell death induction, upon treatment. mice were
treated with tft (as tas-102) and 5-fu (as the prodrug 50 dfur) at their mtd which resulted in 10–20% weight loss
compared to untreated mice. tft treatment caused higher
levels of growth inhibition and cell death induction compared
to 50 -dfur (fig. 6). thus, this in vivo model reﬂects the
results obtained in the cell culture model, whereby tft was
more potent in inducing cell death than 5-fu and is much
more active on the long term than 5-fu.

discussion
this study demonstrates that autophagy protects against  xxxd2134xxx  cytotoxicity, in contrast to tft in human colon cancer
cell lines. cell death by tft and 5-fu was induced via activation of multiple cell death pathways, although  xxxg548xxx 
mediated caspase independent cell death might be more important for tft. these differences may be related to different
mechanistic actions of tft, compared to 5-fu. the differenc 2009 uicc

ces between tft and 5-fu emphasize the potential importance of tft as a new treatment strategy for colorectal and
gastric cancer.
tft (as tas102) is currently under development as a new
(oral) treatment option in 5-fu resistance in colorectal and
gastric cancer.39 tft has shown activity in 5-fu-resistant
cells, both in in vitro and in vivo studies.40 both tft and  xxxd2134xxx  induced cell death that was partially mediated in a caspase
dependent manner, however tft activity seems to be less dependent on p53.14 here, we found that the activation of caspase dependent cell death pathways varied between cell lines,
but the pathway of cell death activation did not differ much
between tft and 5-fu. the cell line speciﬁc variation in cell
death activation may be related to different expression levels
and or regulation of cell death mediators that are currently
not known. in general, tft appeared to be somewhat more
potent in inducing caspase-dependent cell death than 5-fu.

widr (low ts expression) cells exposed to the speciﬁc ts
inhibitor, ag337, demonstrated levels of caspase related cell
death induction comparable to that induced by 5-fu in this
study.23 this suggests that 5-fu acts mainly by ts inhibition
in these cell lines. previously it was reported that tft, in its
monophosphate form (tft-mp), can inhibit ts very rapidly,
however it does not form a stable complex,8,9 which is in
contrast to 5-fu. since tft can also be incorporated into
the dna and induces dna damage,11,12 ts inhibition may
not be the main mechanism of action of tft. moreover, we
reported previously that tft induces an arrest in the g2/
m-phase and polyploidy.15 although these phenomena are
known to be induced by microtubule inhibitors, such as taxanes, they are less expected to be associated with the activity
of a nucleoside analog that targets the s-phase of the cell
cycle, e.g., by ts inhibition and dna damage induction.24
the difference between tft and 5-fu induced cell death
was also found in in vivo experiments, in which tft (as
tas-102) induced more tumor growth inhibition and caused
more cell death than the 5-fu prodrug 50 -dfur37. in other
preclinical in vivo studies, tas-102 also showed a better antitumor effect than various other 5-fu formulations, all at
their mtd.6,12 together with these ﬁndings, our current
study indicates that tft and 5-fu elicit different cellular
responses with respect to cell cycle arrest, cell death activation and induction of autophagy.
autophagy can act as a rescue mechanism that cells can
use to escape from cell death. however, autophagy may play
a dual role that may be treatment and cell type dependent.
previously, it was reported that various anticancer compounds such as histone deacetylase inhibitors can induce
autophagy, which possibly contributed to their anticancer ac-

tft vs. 5-fu: cell death and autophagy

tivity.41,42 however, other histone deacetylase inhibitors triggered autophagy that did not result in an enhancement of
cell death activation.43 the induction of autophagy in the latter studies, similar as we found for 5-fu, reﬂects a survival
response in reaction to drug treatment whereby damaged intracellular material is stored and degraded in vesicles. for
cancer therapy, this can be considered as an undesired effect
of the mechanism of action of the anticancer agent, which
counteracts the tumor cell killing ability of the drug. since
we found that inhibition of the autophagic response by
3-ma enhances 5-fu activity, inhibitors of autophagy
may potentially act synergistic with compounds that induce
autophagy. recently, li et al reported a similar effect,
whereby inhibition of autophagy could increase the cytotoxicity of 5-fu in the colon cancer cell lines ht-29 and colon26.32 further investigation of the autophagy related cellular responses that are associated with anticancer drug activity
should diminish some of the current controversy.
a number of caspase independent cell death pathways
have been described. possible secondary mechanisms of cell
death induction include lysosomal proteases, the cathepsins.44
upon release from the lysosome into the cytoplasm, cathepsins can cleave a number of substrates, which will end in
cell death. cathepsin mediated cell death results in a necrotic
type of cell death, since the regulation of the cathepsins outside the lysosomes is less precise. the caspase independent
cell death induction by tft and 5-fu was (partially) mediated by the activation of  xxxg548xxx , which was associated
with the occurrence of necrotic cells.  xxxg548xxx  dependent
death has been reported to partially mediate cell death activation by microtubule stabilizing agents, such as paclitaxel,  xxxd2854xxx  and discodermolide,31 which are also known to
induce a g2/m arrest similar to tft. moreover,  xxxg548xxx 
may also cross-activate the caspase-apoptotic pathway via
bid, since inhibition clearly reduced the apoptotic-cell
death.45,46 our data indicate that nucleoside analogs such as
tft can also trigger  xxxg548xxx , although the mechanism
underlying its activation is yet unclear. our ﬁnding that this
contribution varies in a cell speciﬁc manner and that in some
cases its activation can be either caspase-dependent or independent indicates that multiple mechanisms can induce this
cell death pathway. regardless of this,  xxxg548xxx  may be
important for the sensitivity to these agents. besides cathepsins, rip1 kinase may be involved in a necrotic-type of
regulated cell death, called necroptosis.47 this type of cell
death can be induced when apoptosis is blocked by inhibition
of caspases. since in colo320  xxxg342xxx  is not expressed and
the exact mechanism of cell death is unclear, rip1 kinase
may be a potential regulator in this cell line.
the present data give more insight into the mechanism of
tft induced cell death, when compared to 5-fu. these differences between tft and 5-fu can potentially be exploited
in the clinic, e.g., tft as second line treatment when patients
are or have become resistant to 5-fu. since the long term
survival after exposure of cells to tft was much lower than
c 2009 uicc

bijnsdorp et al.

2467

after 5-fu, clinical trials should be focused on overall survival and less on direct tumor responses (growth inhibition).
moreover, since tft is clinically combined with the  xxxg2365xxx  inhibitor (tpi) (tas-102), angiogenesis

may potentially also be inhibited,48 providing a strong basis
for further development of tft. therefore, we conclude that
the clinical development of tft yields promising perspectives
as therapy for gastrointestinal cancers.
