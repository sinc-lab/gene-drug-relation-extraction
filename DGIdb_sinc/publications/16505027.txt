purpose. this study analyzes additional mechanisms behind the
ocular hypotensive effect of prostaglandin f (pgf) receptor
( xxxg1878xxx ) agonists pgf2␣ and fluprostenol (fluprostenolisopropyl ester [ xxxd3414xxx ]), which reduce intraocular pressure (iop) in patients with glaucoma probably by enhancing
uveoscleral flow. the trabecular meshwork (tm) is actively
involved in iop regulation through contractile mechanisms.
contractility of tm is induced by endothelin (et)-1, a possible
pathogenic factor in glaucoma. the involvement of  xxxg1878xxx 
agonists in the et-1 effects on tm function was studied.
methods. the effects of  xxxg1878xxx  agonists on contractility of
bovine tm (btm) were investigated using a force-length transducer. the effects of pgf2␣ on intracellular ca2⫹ ([ca2⫹]i)
mobilization in cultured cells were measured using fura-2am.
the expression of the  xxxg1878xxx  protein was examined using
western blot analysis.
results. the et-1–induced (10⫺8 m) contraction in isolated
btm was inhibited by pgf2␣ (10⫺6 m) and fluprostenol (10⫺6
m). this effect was blocked by  xxxg1878xxx  antagonists. carbachol-induced contraction or baseline tension was not affected
by pgf2␣ or fluprostenol. in cultured tm cells, et-1 caused a
transient increase in [ca2⫹]i that was reduced by pgf2␣. no
reduction occurred in the presence of the  xxxg1878xxx  antagonist al-8810. western blot analysis revealed the expression of
the  xxxg1878xxx  in native and cultured tm.
conclusions.  xxxg1878xxx  agonists operate by direct interaction
with et-1–induced contractility of tm. this effect is mediated
by the  xxxg1878xxx . thus,  xxxg1878xxx  agonists may decrease
iop by enhancing aqueous humor outflow through the tm by
inhibiting et-1– dependent mechanisms. (invest ophthalmol

the uveoscleral pathway.1–3 however, the mechanisms of action of these agents on iop remain partially unclear. evidence
shows increased secretion of matrix metalloproteinases
(mmps) by the ciliary muscle after treatment with pgf2␣ and
pgf2␣-related compounds.4,5 the activation of mmp in the
extracellular space results in a reduction of extracellular matrix
(ecm) components such as collagen and laminin.6,7 the decrease of ecm within the interbundle spaces of the ciliary
muscle reduces hydraulic resistance to aqueous humor outflow
and thereby probably contributes to the pgf2␣-mediated increase of uveoscleral outflow. increased immunoreactivity for
mmps was detected in the sclera and iris root of monkey eyes
as well as in the ciliary muscle after pgf2␣ treatment.8 in organ
cultures of human sclera, increased scleral permeability was
found after exposure to pgf2␣-related compounds, which was
accompanied by increased expression of mmps.9
other authors10,11 have described the involvement of the
myosin light chain (mlc) kinase signaling pathway in the
iop-lowering effect of pgf2␣ and its analogues, and they have
examined the effect of pgf2␣ and  xxxd2446xxx  on phosphoinositide turnover, mlc phosphorylation, and contraction in cat
and bovine iris sphincter. in these tissues, pgf2␣ and  xxxd2446xxx  increased inositol phosphate production, mlc phosphorylation, and contraction. in addition, they suggest that changes
in the contraction–relaxation of smooth muscles of the anterior segment could facilitate aqueous humor outflow and thus
contribute to the iop-lowering effects of fp-class prostaglandins.
adjacent to the smooth muscle of the iris, the trabecular
meshwork (tm)—with its smooth muscle-like properties—is
located in the anterior segment of the eye. it is now widely
accepted that the tm contributes actively to the regulation of
conventional outflow and thus to iop.12 contraction of tm
decreases outflow, whereas relaxation increases this parameter. contraction of tm is induced by muscarinic agonists and
by endothelin (et)-1. accumulating evidence indicates a role
for et-1 in the pathogenesis of glaucoma.13–17 the antiglaucoma drug unoprostone, a docosanoid with affinity to the fp
receptor, appears to decrease iop by an anti-endothelin effect
on tm contractility.15 it has been shown that unoprostone
increases the facility of outflow through the tm.18
until now, nothing has been known about the effects of
other  xxxg1878xxx  agonists on tm contractility or the involvement of this tissue in the iop-lowering effect of these agents.
this study was performed to investigate the effect of pgf2␣
and fluprostenol (fluprostenol–isopropylester [ xxxd3414xxx ]) on
tm contractility.

least 1 hour before various agents were applied. only strips showing a
stable basic contractile tone were used for experiments. direct isometric tension measurements of single tm strips were performed using a
force-length transducer. tissue strip contractions induced by et-1
were expressed relative to the response obtained with a maximal
effective carbachol concentration (10⫺6 m), which was tested in each
strip as a control and set to 100% force obtainable. determination of
et-1 activity in the presence of inhibitory substances was accomplished after preincubation with these substances and an et-1 peak in
the presence of inhibitors. the ionic concentrations (in 10⫺3 m) of
ringer’s solution were: 151 na⫹, 5 k⫹, 1.7 ca2⫹, 0.9 mg2⫹, 131 cl⫺,
0.9 so42⫺, 1 h2po4⫺, 28 hco3⫺, and 5 glucose. all solutions were
kept at 37°c, and a stable ph (7.4) achieved by gassing with 5% co2
in air.

cell cultures
btm strips were used for cell cultures as described previously.20 btm
cell cultures were incubated in dulbecco modified eagle medium
(dmem) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (fcs), 100 u/ml
penicillin, and 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin. human tm (htm) strips were
excised from eyes previously enucleated for posterior malignant melanoma without history of glaucoma. htm cell cultures were established and characterized as previously described21,22 and were incubated in dmem supplemented with 20% fcs, 100 ␮g/ml kanamycin,
and 50 ␮g/ml gentamicin. cell cultures were maintained at 37°c and
5% co2 in air. the medium was changed twice a week. confluent
cultures were passaged using the trypsin/egta method and split in a
ratio 1:2. only well-characterized cells from early passages (2– 4) were
used. tenets of the declaration of helsinki were followed, informed
consent was obtained, and institutional human experimentation committee approval was granted for the studies.

measurement of [ca2ⴙ]i
measurements of [ca2⫹]i were performed using the ca2⫹-sensitive dye
fura-2am based on methods described by grynkiewicz et al.23 cells in
culture flasks were trypsinated and thereafter cultured on coverslips
for at least 1 week. before each experiment, semiconfluent cells were
incubated in control solution (hepes-ringer) with 10 ␮m fura-2am for
30 minutes at room temperature. the dye was loaded by diffusion and
intracellular cleavage of fura-2am to fura-2. then the coverslip was
placed into the perfusion chamber on the stage of an inverted microscope. cells were perfused with control solution for 30 minutes to
wash out extracellular dye before the measurement was started. the
excitation light was generated by a xenon lamp (xpo 75 w/2; osram,
munich, germany) filtered by two rotating filters (6/s) at 340 and 380
nm. relative fluorescence of fura-2 after excitation was registered at
510 nm by a photomultiplier (928 sf; hamamatsu, hamamatsu, japan)
with consequent signal detection with an epc-9 patch-clamp amplifier.
for data storage and processing, tida for windows was used. changes
in the 340/380-nm fluorescence ratio represent relative changes in
[ca2⫹]i. absolute [ca2⫹]i was calculated using the equation and dissociation constant of grynkiewicz.23 the ionic concentrations (in 10⫺3
m) of hepes-ringer solution were: 151 na⫹, 5 k⫹, 1.7 ca2⫹, 0.9 mg2⫹,
156.7 cl⫺, 0.9 so42⫺, 1 h2po4⫺, 10 hepes, and 5 glucose.

western blot analysis
cultured cells were washed with ice-cold pbs, scraped from the culture dish in ice-cold lysis buffer containing (in 10⫺3 m) 20 tris, 5
mgcl2, 1 edta, and 0.3 egta supplemented with protease inhibitors.
small btm strips were homogenized in lysis buffer using a homogenizer (polytron; kinematik, littau, switzerland). homogenate was obtained by three freeze-thaw cycles and subsequent passage through a
26g1/2 needle. the membrane fraction was separated by two centrifugation steps. samples were first centrifuged for 5 minutes at 500g, and
then the supernatant was centrifuged for 30 minutes at 43,000g (4°c).
the pellet containing the membrane fraction was resuspended in lysis
buffer. protein content was determined using a protein assay reagent

(bca; pierce, rockford, il) and was quantified with a plate reader
(tecan group ltd., zurich, switzerland). lysate with 20 ␮g total
protein was loaded on an 8.5% sds polyacrylamide gel. membrane
lysates and molecular weight markers (fermentas international inc.,
burlington, on, canada) were separated by electrophoresis in mini
protean electrophoresis cells (bio-rad life science group, hercules,
ca). after blotting of proteins to nitrocellulose filter screens (nen life
science products, boston, ma) for 1 hour at 100 v (4°c), blot membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in pbs-tween for 2 hours at
room temperature and overnight with 5% bsa in pbs-tween at 4°c.
membranes were then incubated in polyclonal antibody raised against
the  xxxg1878xxx . after incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and use of detection reagent (lumi light western blotting
substrate; roche, nutley, nj) specific signals were visualized by means
of luminescence imaging (las-1000; fujifilm, sendai, japan). specific
staining was confirmed using the corresponding blocking peptide
combined with the polyclonal antibody in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.

chemicals and solution
the following reagents were used for the experiments:  xxxg674xxx 
(alexis deutschland gmbh, grünberg, germany), pgf2␣, pgf2␣ dimethylamine, pgf2␣ dimethylamide, fluprostenol, and  xxxg1878xxx 
polyclonal antibody (cayman chemicals, ann arbor, mi). all other
chemicals were purchased from merck (darmstadt, germany), sigma
(deisenhofen, germany), and serva (heidelberg, germany).

results
effects of pgf2␣ and fluprostenol on carbacholand et-1–induced contractility
as has been shown,15,24 –27 the muscarinic agonist carbachol
(10⫺6 m) led to a contraction in btm strips that was set to
100% force (fig. 1). et-1 caused contractions from baseline
level in a dose-dependent manner (10⫺9 m et-1, 22.9% ⫾ 5.9%;
10⫺8 m et-1, 61.5% ⫾ 8.4%; both versus carbachol). to test the
effect of pgf2␣ and fluprostenol on the et-1–induced contraction, tissue was preincubated for 20 minutes with  xxxg1878xxx 
agonists before et-1 was applied in the presence of the agonists (fig. 1). et-1–induced contractions were partially blocked
by 10⫺6 m pgf2␣ (10⫺9 m et-1, 4.1% ⫾ 2.1%; 10⫺8 m et-1,
31.0% ⫾ 10.6%; both versus carbachol; fig. 1a) and 10⫺6 m
fluprostenol to 25.0% ⫾ 6.5% (fig. 2a). pgf2␣ and fluprostenol
had no influence on baseline tension or carbachol-induced
contraction (114% ⫾ 11.4%; fig. 1b; 127.1% ⫾ 18.6%; fig. 2b).
a summary of these effects is shown in figure 3.

presence of the  xxxg1878xxx  antagonists pgf2␣ dimethylamide
(fig. 4a) or pgf2␣ dimethylamine. both substances had no
effect on baseline tension of btm strips. in the presence pgf2␣
dimethylamide (10⫺6 m), the 10⫺8 m et-1–induced contraction of btm was not altered by pgf2␣ (10⫺6 m; 55.3% ⫾ 4.1%).

either by application of et-1 (10⫺8 m) (black curve) or application of et-1 (10⫺8 m) after preincubation
of the tissue for 20 minutes with pgf2␣ (10⫺6 m) (gray curve). the et-1–induced contraction in the
presence of pgf2␣ was strongly reduced. (b) after a first carbachol peak, a second contraction was
provoked by application of carbachol (black curve) or application of carbachol after preincubation for 20
minutes with pgf2␣ (gray curve). pgf2␣ had no inhibitory effect on the carbachol-induced contraction.

the same effect was observed in the presence of pgf2␣ dimethylamine (10⫺6 m; 61.7% ⫾ 11.8%; n ⫽ 7). in addition, the
inhibiting effect of fluprostenol on et-1–induced contraction
was abrogated in the presence of al-8810 (10⫺6 m; 50.3% ⫾
6.1%; fig. 4b). a summary of these data is shown in figure 5.

lack of effect of pgf2␣ on
et-1–induced contraction
as mentioned, pgf2␣ has no relaxing effect on baseline tension
in tm. furthermore, no relaxing effect of pgf2␣ on et-1–
induced contraction was observed. when pgf2␣ was applied
after the tissue was treated with et-1 and contraction was
initiated, no reduction of the et-1 effect occurred (fig. 6). in
this case, contraction provoked by et-1 was 69.1% ⫾ 8.9%
(n ⫽ 4) and thus not significantly different from et-1–induced
contraction without pgf2.

effects of pgf2␣ and et-1 on [ca2ⴙ]i
in cultured btm cells, the baseline [ca2⫹]i was 89.4 ⫾ 14.0 nm
(n ⫽ 12). application of et-1 (10⫺8 m) resulted in an increase
of [ca2⫹]i to 203.8% ⫾ 23.3% of the baseline level (figs. 7a,
7c). pgf2␣ (10⫺6 m) reduced the et-1–induced increase to
146.9% ⫾ 8.9% (figs. 7b, 7c). baseline [ca2⫹]i in htm cells
was 105.5 ⫾ 12.3 nm (n ⫽ 24) and is within the range
published by our and other groups.22,28 et-1 (5 ⫻ 10⫺8 m)
caused an increase of [ca2⫹]i to 221.7% ⫾ 19.3% from the

baseline level (fig. 8a). in the presence of pgf2␣ (10⫺5 m), the
et-1–induced enhancement of [ca2⫹]i was 139.0% ⫾ 15.8% of
the baseline level (fig. 8b). in the presence of al-8810 (10⫺6
m), pgf2␣ (10⫺5 m) had no inhibiting effect, and the et-1–
induced [ca2⫹]i peak reached 249.7% ⫾ 49.3% of the baseline
level (fig. 8c). a summary of these data is shown in figure 8d.
application of pgf2␣ (10⫺5–10⫺6 m) or al-8810 (10⫺6 m) had
no effect on baseline [ca2⫹]i in cultured btm and htm cells.

 xxxg1878xxx  detection by western blot analysis
western blot analysis was used to detect the  xxxg1878xxx  on the
protein level. membrane lysates of native btm strips and cultured btm and htm cells were investigated. in all preparations, the  xxxg1878xxx  was identified at 64 kda (fig. 9). corresponding blocking peptide confirmed the specificity of the
detected bands.

discussion
treatment of glaucoma still focuses on lowering iop, either
pharmacologically or surgically. new glaucoma medications,
such as the selective  xxxg1878xxx  agonists, are now widely
accepted as antiglaucomatous drugs, but ongoing discussion
continues concerning the iop-lowering effects of these compounds. some investigators suggest a modulation of conventional outflow facility,15 others see the primary target site in

the enhancement of the uveoscleral outflow.29,30 this study
describes an anti-endothelin effect of pgf2␣ and fluprostenol
on tm contractility and supports the thesis of an influence on
conventional outflow.
et-1 is one of the most potent vasoactive peptides known,
and it has been shown to play an important role in vascular
homeostasis31 and in a variety of pathologic processes.32 additionally, et-1 seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of
glaucoma.16 aqueous humor et-1 levels are elevated in eyes
with primary open-angle glaucoma14 and exfoliation syndrome33 compared with those in healthy subjects. this is
consistent with the observation of increased et-1 concentrations in blood plasma of patients with normal-tension glaucoma.34 furthermore, et-1 has been shown to be important for
the regulation of the conventional outflow in the anterior
segment of bovine15,35 and primate eyes.36,37 et-1 has been
found to cause contraction of vascular smooth muscle and
pericytes and seems to play a role in retinal and choroidal
blood flow.17,38 the effects of et-1 are mediated through two

receptors, et-ar and  xxxg677xxx ,39,40 both expressed in tm. the
et-1–induced contraction was mainly mediated by the etar,41 whereas the function of the  xxxg677xxx  in tm has not been
clear until now. an inhibition of et-1–induced tm contractility
by  xxxg1878xxx  agonists probably increases outflow facility and
might decrease iop. the pgf2␣-induced enhancement of ocular and retinal blood flow, and with it neuroprotective action,
could be the result of a similar effect of pgf2␣ on vascular
smooth muscle in the eye.
it is important to note that pgf2␣ and fluprostenol were
unable to influence baseline contractility or pathways that
involve g-protein–linked muscarinic receptors, suggesting the
involvement of different g-proteins, g-protein⫺coupled receptor kinases, or protein kinases in et and muscarinic receptor
activation and desensitization. another possible cause for the

under these conditions, pgf2␣ and fluprostenol failed to inhibit the et-1–induced contraction.

phase of the et-1–induced contraction, pgf2␣ (10⫺6 m) was added. under
these conditions, the prostaglandin had no inhibitory effect.

missing effect of pgf2␣ on carbachol-induced contraction
could be differences in the signaling pathways from activated
et and muscarinic receptors. in tm, muscarinic receptors of
the m1-, m2-, and m3-subtypes are expressed and involved in
contractility.25 an effect of pgf2␣ on tm contractility mediated
by these receptors could be excluded from our study.
the mechanisms of the anti-endothelin action of  xxxg1878xxx  agonists are not yet clarified. investigations with  xxxg1878xxx  blockers indicate that the effect is mediated by the fp
receptor. in other smooth muscle, such as bovine iris sphincter, pgf2␣ stimulates phosphoinositide turnover, myosin lightchain phosphorylation, and contraction through the  xxxg1878xxx  with ec50 values of 9, 42, and 140 nm, respectively.11 in
our study, a pgf2␣ concentration of 1 to 10 ␮m was used. in
this concentration range, no effect on tm contractility or

iovs, march 2006, vol. 47, no. 3
baseline [ca2⫹]i could be observed. the western blot data
confirm the protein expression of the  xxxg1878xxx  in bovine
and human tm. the molecular weight (64 kda) is within the
range published by others.11 until now, the expression of the
 xxxg1878xxx  in human tm has been shown by immunofluorescence microscopy and rt-pcr methods only.42 possibly, the
 xxxg1878xxx  density is too low in tm to induce contractility in
comparison with other smooth muscle systems. another explanation could be the expression of different  xxxg1878xxx 
isoforms in tm. until now, two isoforms have been identified,
the fpa and the fpb receptors, which are for the most part
identical except for their carboxyl termini.43 fpb is essentially
a truncated version of fpa that lacks the 46 carboxyl-terminal
amino acids, including four putative protein kinase c (pkc)
phosphorylation sites.44 the carboxyl terminus of the fpa is a
substrate for pkc, and pkc-dependent phosphorylation is responsible for differential regulation of second-messenger pathways by  xxxg1878xxx  isoforms. thus, differences in the expression pattern of receptor isoforms may cause different cellular
signaling after receptor activation. it should also be mentioned
that most tissues contain a heterogeneous population of prostaglandin receptor subtypes mediating relaxation and contraction of smooth muscles and that most prostaglandin agonists
display activity at different prostaglandin receptors.45,46 the
cellular response depends on agonist potency at the different
receptors. possibly, in tm, pgf2␣ induces contraction and
relaxation by way of different receptors, and each effect compensates for the other so that no effect on contractility could
be observed.
it has been shown that the inhibiting effect of pgf2␣ on
et-1–induced contractility occurred only if the prostaglandin
was applied before et-1 was added. application of pgf2␣ after
the onset of the et-1 contraction was ineffective. based on this
observation, we conclude that the  xxxg1878xxx  must be activated before et-1 binds to its receptor to induce attenuation of
the et-1 effect. given that in tm the et-ar is mainly respon-

supposed. in consequence of pgf2␣ preincubation, the et-1–
induced increase in [ca2⫹]i is diminished and contractile force
is reduced. we cannot elucidate from our data whether this
effect occurs at the level of the et receptor or at intracellular
pathways leading to an enhancement of [ca2⫹]i.
our data show an inhibition of the et-1–induced increase in
[ca2⫹]i by pgf2␣ in bovine and human tm cells. we did not
detect any effect on baseline [ca2⫹]i by pgf2␣, which underscores the missing effect of this compound on baseline contractility. in tm, contractility is partially dependent and partially independent of intracellular ca2⫹. the ca2⫹-independent
contraction uses pkc and rho-a/rock–mediated pathways
based on pharmacomechanical coupling events.24,47 we cannot exclude the existence of additional effects of pgf2␣ and
fluprostenol on ca2⫹-independent contractility.

figure 9. expression of  xxxg1878xxx  ( xxxg1878xxx ) in
tm. western blot analysis of membrane lysates incubated with anti-fp
receptor antibody detected a specific signal at approximately 64 kda
(arrows) in native bovine tissue strips, cultured bovine cells, and
human tm cells. specific staining of the antibody was verified by use
of the corresponding blocking peptide (bp).

in contrast to our results, sharif et al.48 described a
phosphoinositide turnover and intracellular ca2⫹ mobilization in htm cells induced by fp class prostaglandin analogs,
such as  xxxd3414xxx ,  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd340xxx , unoprostone
isopropyl ester, and pgf2␣. the missing effects of pgf2␣ on
[ca2⫹]i we observed are in good agreement with our contractility measurements. in addition, krauss et al.49 show
that pgf2␣ has no effect on tm contractility. pgf2␣ does not
induce changes in [ca2⫹]i or affect baseline tension. it may
be that we could not detect very small changes in [ca2⫹]i
with our experimental equipment. irrespective of this, a
pgf2␣-induced increase in [ca2⫹]i is insufficient for triggering contractions in tm.
it is well known that in humans the main part of aqueous
humor is drained through conventional outflow. direct measurements in human eyes have suggested that less than 15%
of aqueous humor is drained by the uveoscleral routes.
however, indirect calculations indicate that rate to be approximately 35% in young adults and of 3% in elderly persons (older than 60 years; for review, see 50). this suggests
that in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, the
uveoscleral outflow contributes to aqueous humor drainage
to only a minor degree. therefore, we assume that the
anti-endothelin effect on tm contractility, which increases
aqueous humor outflow through the conventional route, is
also involved in the iop-lowering effect of  xxxg1878xxx 
agonists.
in summary, this study suggests an additional hypotensive
effect of pgf2␣ and fluprostenol. this could be the result of an
intervention in et-1– dependent pathways in the tm, namely
inhibition of the et-1–induced increase in [ca2⫹]i, causing a
reduction of contractility of this tissue.
