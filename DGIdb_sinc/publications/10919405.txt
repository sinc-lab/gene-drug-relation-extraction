properties of anti–factor viii inhibitor antibodies in
 xxxg751xxx  patients

abstact blood  xxxg751xxx  functions
in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation as a cofactor by enhancing the assembly of its complex with
factors ix and x on the surface of activated platelets.
this requires factor viii interaction with these two
proteins,  xxxg2423xxx  (vwf), and phospholipids on the platelet surface. once factor viii and
 xxxg752xxx  are activated by proteolytic cleavage, the
complex is able to activate  xxxg741xxx  to  xxxg741xxx  by
proteolysis. in  xxxg751xxx  patients with severe factor viii deficiency, about 30% respond to factor viii
infusion therapy immunologically to produce antibodies that inactivate the infused factor viii and others that are noninhibitory. an assay that measures
only the inhibitor antibodies demonstrated that the
factor viii a2, a3, and c2 domains are the most immunogenic, and domains a1 and b are poorly immunogenic or not immunogenic. the specific antibody responses to a2, a3, and c2 vary considerably
among individuals, and epitopes for inhibitor antibodies have been determined for all three. the antic2 inhibitors prevent factor viii binding to phospholipids and vwf, and anti-a3 inhibitors prevent

binding to  xxxg752xxx  (ixa). an inhibitor binding site
for  xxxg741xxx  has been localized to the a1 domain
acidic region, leading to inhibition of factor viii/ xxxg741xxx  binding by antibodies. this inhibitor mechanism is rare. beause a second binding site for factor
ix was localized to the factor viii a2 domain, it is
likely but not proven that prevention of  xxxg752xxx 
binding to factor viii is the inhibitor mechanism for
this epitope.

activated protease  xxxg752xxx  (factor ixa) in the proteolytic cleavage of  xxxg741xxx .1 factors viii, ix, and x are
phospholipid binding proteins that form a complex that
binds to the surface of activated platelets2 via phosphatidylserine (ps)3 that is exposed upon cell activation.
when factor viii is activated by thrombin, its affinity
for phospholipid membranes and activated platelets is
increased 10-fold.4
factor viii is a complex protein consisting of three
a and two c domains (fig. 1)1 that share considerable
homology among each domain type. a large, unique b
domain inserted between domains a2 and a3 is not required for factor viii activity.5 short regions that are
rich in acidic amino acids are located between the a1
and a2 and the b and a3 domains.1
the sites on factor viii that allow its binding to factors ix and x and phospholipids have been more precisely determined in recent studies. solid phase binding
assays were done to demonstrate that the a1 domain, but
not a2 or a3-c1-c2, was able to bind to  xxxg741xxx .6 a
synthetic peptide consisting of amino acids 337 to 372 in
the acidic region at the c-terminus of a1 was able to
compete for  xxxg741xxx  binding to a1. this result was further confirmed by chemical cross-linking of the peptide
to the heavy chain of  xxxg741xxx  and by the inhibition of
 xxxg1847xxx  cleavage between a1 residues 336
and 337. the a1 acidic region has an additional role in
maintaining association of the a2 domain with the
a1/a3-c1-c2 complex upon thrombin activation,7 as
shown by the prevention of in vitro reconstitution of  xxxg751xxx  from the a2 and a3-c1-c2 fragments by the
acidic region peptide and antipeptide antibodies.
factor viii interaction with  xxxg752xxx  requires two
binding sites that are located in factor viii domains a2
and a3. two peptides from the a2 region 558 to 565
were able to decrease by 80% the generation of factor
xa by  xxxg751xxx  and factor ixa with increasing peptide concentrations.8 trypsin cleavage of peptide 558 to
565 eliminated this effect. the discovery of this a2
binding site for  xxxg752xxx /factor ixa led to the demonstration that purified a2 domain alone is able to weakly

stimulate the activity of factor ixa by increasing the kcat
but not km,9 whereas when saturating amounts of the a1
and a2 domains are used together, the kcat increases to 5
to 10% of that for  xxxg751xxx .
recombinant factor viii light chain fragments of
different lengths were transcribed and translated in vitro,
and they were used to determine the factor viii binding
site for a monoclonal antibody that inhibited factor
viii/ xxxg752xxx  binding.10 these were synthesized and
immobilized onto a surface. the binding of a series of
overlapping synthetic peptides to the monoclonal antibody was used to determine a minimal epitope of amino
acids 1811 to 1818, whereas peptide 1804 to 1818 was
able to prevent factor viii light chain binding to factor
ix and to reduce generation of  xxxg741xxx  by factors ixa
and viiia.
vwf is a carrier for factor viii in the blood circulation. this serves as a way to prevent dissociation of the
factor viii heavy and light chains, because they are not
covalently linked upon secretion from the factor viii
producing cells.11 in addition, vwf prevents the potential premature interaction of factor viii with phospholipids12 and thrombin-activated platelets.13 this is due to
the overlap of the factor viii binding sites for vwf and
phospholipids.12 the ps binding site was localized to c2
domain residues 2303 to 2332 as determined by inhibition of factor viii/ps binding by synthetic peptides
spanning the entire c2 domain.14
in order to function as a cofactor, factor viii is
brought to the activated platelet surface by vwf binding
to either glycoprotein (gp)ib/ix or  xxxg1202xxx /iiia. subsequent cleavage by thrombin releases vwf from factor
viii, allowing  xxxg751xxx  to bind to activated platelets.
cleavages that also remove the b domain or an initially
b domainless factor viii bind with a kd 2.1 nm, a fivefold increase over that of unactivated factor viii (kd
10.4 nm).15 this indicates a direct role for the b domain
in down-regulating factor viii–platelet interaction. the
acidic region of the light chain was initially identified as
containing a vwf binding site,16,17 but later studies also
found such a site within c2.18 a detailed comparison of

fig. 1. the upper bar shows the protein structure of factor viii. the three a domains as well as the two c domains are highly homologous, and the b domain is not similar to any known protein. the shaded regions are the areas rich in acidic amino acids. the sites of
thrombin cleavage are shown by the arrows. the heavy and light chains are cleaved intracellularly at residue 1649.

the role of these two regions showed that factor viii proteolytic fragments containing either the acidic region or
the c2 domain had 180- and 1650-fold lower affinities,
respectively, for vwf than factor viii (0.4 nm) had.18

domain specificities of anti-factor
viii inhibitor antibodies in
 xxxg751xxx  patients
antibodies to factor viii arise in approximately
30% of multitransfused patients with severe hemophilia
a and less frequently in patients with moderate or mild
hemophilia. inhibitor neutralization assays were developed to determine to which factor viii domains inhibitory antibodies are directed.19 this method employs
plasmas diluted to 1 to 2 bethesda units per milliliter and
incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of
factor viii domains isolated from thrombin-cleaved factor viii or from recombinant factor viii domains expressed from a baculoviral vector in insect cells.20 the
maximum decrease in the bethesda units per milliliter
for each factor viii domain represents the fraction of inhibitory antibodies that bind to each domain. a3-c1
binding was determined by the difference between
whole light chain and c2 binding (table 1). the inhibitor domain specificities differed considerably among
the antibodies of individual patients, but the major epitopes are contained within a2, c2, or a3-c1.
in patients with hemophilia who developed inhibitors after treatment with plasma-derived or recombinant factor viii, 24% and 44% of 34 plasma samples
tested were  70% neutralized by the a2 domain or the
light chain, respectively. the neutralization by light chain

domains could be attributed solely to the c2 domain in
29%. antibodies to two or more different domains were
seen in 83% of the patients. the predominant inhibitor
epitopes (61 to 83%) were found to be within c2, a2, and
a3-c1; however, the combined light chain domains were
the most immunogenic. data from the plasma of 15 patients tested are summarized in table 1.

epitope mapping and mechanisms
of factor viii inactivation by
inhibitor antibodies
the first section describes the interations of factor
viii with ligands that are essential for its activity. as expected, the prevention of factor viii binding to these
proteins and phospholipids of the factor xase complex
constitutes several ways in which factor viii activity is
abolished in vivo.
overlapping synthetic peptides were used to localize the epitopes within the a1 domain for a monoclonal
and five human inhibitor antibodies. the 351 to 365
acidic region peptide was able to compete by > 95% for
binding of the monoclonal antibody to factor viii and to
significantly neutralize the inhibitor activity.21 one human inhibitor was neutralized to about the same extent
by the peptide,22 whereas two others tested were not neutralized. the competition of peptide and  xxxg741xxx  for factor viii binding described earlier in the first section indicates that the inhibitory mechanism for these antibodies
is prevention of factor viii binding to  xxxg741xxx , although
this has not been tested directly. the exact frequency of
anti-a1 inhibitors has been diffcult to determine because
the a2, c2, and a3-c1 domains are more highly immunogenic than is the heavy chain acidic region.20
a different method for specifically determining inhibitor epitopes as opposed to those of noninhibitory antibodies is the use of hybrids of human and porcine factor viii. although these two factor viiis are highly
homologous, there exist enough amino acid differences
between them to reduce binding of some anti–factor viii
antibodies, which leads to less efficient factor viii inactivation. such hybrid proteins were initially used to localize the epitope of anti-a2 inhibitors by demonstrating
that certain porcine substitutions greatly reduced their
inhibition of factor viii activity.23 by this method, the
a2 epitope was shown to consist of the sequence 484508.24 amino acids critical for antibody binding were
further localized by alanine scanning mutagenesis.25 all
amino acids within 484 to 508 that differed between human and porcine factor viii were mutated to alanine.
the mutation of tyr487 → ala reduced to < 20% the
ability of five human inhibitor plasmas to inactivate factor viii. however, other mutations within the epitope region led to variable effects on the inhibitor titers. the inability of anti-a2 antibodies to prevent factor viii
binding to factor x26 suggests that the antibodies block

binding to factor ixa or inhibit the function of the
assembled factor xase complex. further investigation
will be required to identify the actual inhibitory mechanism.
the binding of some inhibitor antibodies prevents
the interaction of factor viii light chain with phospholipids.27 deletions of the c1-c2 domains expressed in
escherichia coli were used in immunoblotting assays to
suggest that monoclonal and human inhibitors bind to
c2 amino acids 2248 to 2312.28 a series of overlapping
synthetic peptides covering the c2 domain was used to
demonstrate in a solid phase competition binding assay
of factor viii to phospholipids that residues 2303 to
2332 are responsible for factor viii binding.14 however,
the use of human and porcine hybrids suggested also that
part of the functional inhibitor epitope is located near the
c2 amino-terminus within residues 2181 to 224329 for
monoclonal and human antibodies. this inconsistency
suggests that the disulfide linkage that brings the aminoand carboxyl-termini of c2 within close proximity30
may create a c2 epitope for phospholipids and inhibitors
that consists of amino acids from both c2 regions.
one of the vwf binding sites for factor viii is located within the c2 domain, and a further study showed
that vwf and phospholipids compete for a similar c2
site.12 as a result, inhibitors that bind to the c2 epitope
of 2181 to 2243 and 2303 to 2332 block both vwf and
phospholipid binding to factor viii.31 conversely, inhibitors with c2 specificity were less inhibitory when
factor viii was complexed with vwf.32 the interference
by anti-c2 antibodies in factor viii association with
phospholipids is clearly inhibitory to factor viii activity;
however, the impact of prevention of factor viii binding
to vwf appears to be more complex.
it is known that unactivated factor viii is protected
in the circulation from dissociation of its heavy and light
chains by binding to vwf. this is critical because the
half-life of factor viii in humans depends on the circulating level of vwf.33 in experiments using mutant dogs
with undetectable vwf levels, the half-life of infused
factor viii was reduced 5- to 10-fold. the interference
with vwf binding of factor viii by high-titer anti–factor
viii antibodies is also likely to prevent factor viii delivery to the platelet surface on which it carries out its
function.
an epitope for a monoclonal antibody that prevents
vwf binding to factor viii light chain was determined
by competition for factor viii antibody binding by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using
synthetic factor viii peptides. the sequence 1670-1684
was the most effective, and polyclonal antibodies to this
peptide were also able to prevent factor viii binding to
vwf.34 in contrast, rabbit polyclonal antibodies to peptide 1663 to 1669 were factor viii inhibitors, but the
mechanism of the inhibition was not determined. a
novel and probably rare mechanism for factor viii inhibition by both monoclonal and human antibodies that

share the c2 epitope 2218 to 2307 is the ability of the
antibodies to slow the release of thrombin-cleaved factor
viii from vwf,35 which reduces its binding to phospholipids.
a human inhibitor immunoglobulin g (igg) was
able to interfere with the binding of factor viii light
chain to factor ixa.36 an additional three inhibitors in
another study had the same properties.37 this was further
confirmed by inhibition of binding of the inhibitor iggs
to light chain by the a3 domain peptide 1804 to 1819
and the ability of the iggs to prevent the generation of
 xxxg741xxx  by the  xxxg751xxx /factor ixa complex in a
chromogenic assay.

inhibitor appearance in mild or
moderate hemophilia or under
unusual circumstances
inhibitors in mild or moderate hemophilia most often arise under unusual circumstances such as surgery or
major trauma. the inflammation that accompanies these
conditions and the increased factor viii dosage used for
therapy stimulate the immune system. such conditions
are generally the cause of inhibitor formation in these
patients.
because of the presence of low levels of factor viii
or normal levels of factor viii that are not fully functional because of a mutation causing mild or moderate
hemophilia, the occurrence of inhibitors is much less
frequent. in one study of 1306 patients with hemophilia,
14.5, 0.6, and 0.3% of the patients with severe, moderate, and mild hemophilia, respectively, developed inhibitors.38 the factor viii domain specificities or epitopes of the inhibitors, or both, were not examined in
patients with mild hemophilia until recently because of
the lack of methods for these analyses in earlier studies.
the inhibitory antibodies from 2 patients with arg593
→ cys mutations were first analyzed by inhibitor neutralization or domain-binding assays. the inhibitor of 1
patient was 95% neutralized by the a2 domain and
< 15% neutralized by the light chain or c2 domain, and
it was  10-fold less inhibitory to a human/porcine hybrid in which a2 residues 484 to 508 were substituted
with porcine residues.39 the inhibitor epitope was therefore the same as that determined for severe hemophiliacs. additional immunoprecipitation assays revealed
that there were decreasing concentrations of antibodies
to the a3-c1, c2, a2 and a1 domains. however, the results demonstrated that the response was polyclonal, as
seen in severe hemophiliacs. as the patients’ factor viii
level dropped to 1% from 11% prior to inhibitor development, the immune response described before inactivated not only the exogenous but also the endogenous
factor viii.
a second patient with arg593 → cys had an inhibitor with specificity for the entire heavy chain and a2

anti–factor viii inhibitor antibodies—scandella

conclusions
the major mechanism by which factor viii is inhibited by antibodies that develop in  xxxg751xxx  patients infused with factor viii is the interference with its
binding to  xxxg752xxx :  xxxg741xxx  phospholipids, and vwf.
its binding to these four ligands is required for normal
blood coagulation by the intrinsic pathway. interference
with factor viii/ xxxg741xxx  binding by antibodies is less
frequently observed. antibodies binding to the a3 domain prevent  xxxg752xxx  binding and anti-c2 antibodies
prevent binding to phospholipids and vwf. the delay of
vwf release upon thrombin cleavage of factor viii,
which leads to its inability to bind phospholipids on the
surface of activated platelets, is another rarely observed
inhibition by a second type of anti-c2 antibody. because
of the heterogeneity of inhibitor mechanisms among individuals, for future therapy it will be necessary to find
ways to suppress both antibody formation and already
ongoing immune responses in all hemophiliacs with
inhibitors so that infusion of factor viii is again therapeutic.

but not for the light chain.40 in this patient the antibodies
were a2 specific. recombinant a2 fragments with the
normal or the mutant amino acid sequence were produced and tested for binding to the inhibitor. only the
wild type a2 was able to bind. the response of this patient was therefore monospecific and directed only
against the a2 domain of the exogenous factor viii.
two mild patients with arg2150→his mutations
within the c1 domain produced antibodies against both
the a2 domain and the light chain.40 however, the titers
for the light chain were 6.6 and 151-fold higher than
were those for a2, and there was no binding to c2,
demonstrating the differing polyclonality of the immune
responses. one of the inhibitor iggs characterized in
more detail inactivated exogenous but not endogenous
factor viii. the inhibition occurred only when factor
viii was bound to vwf, and the mechanism by which it
occurred was the delayed release of vwf from factor
viii. this inhibition is due to antibody binding to c1—
not to c2!
an unusual and unexpected outbreak of inhibitors
occurred in the early 1990s in europe after previously
treated hemophiliacs who never had inhibitors were
given a new heat-pasteurized factor viii product. the
inhibitors that arose were unusual in that they were specific for the c2 domain41 in both inhibitor neutralization
and immunoprecipitation assays. this result suggests in
addition that inhibitors and noninhibitors were c2 specific. perhaps the heat pasteurization caused conformational changes within c2, but no direct evidence that this
is the cause of the immunogenicity exists. once the altered factor viii product was no longer given, the inhibitors disappeared.
