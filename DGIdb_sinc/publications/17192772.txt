in a prospective follow-up study of the effects of  xxxg2418xxx  and cyp2c9 genotypes on the anticoagulation status of
patients, we assessed the cyp2c9 and the  xxxg2418xxx  c1173t genotypes of patients during the initial 6 months of
 xxxd2911xxx  treatment. we used linear regression models and cox proportional hazard models to determine the
effects of the  xxxg2418xxx  and cyp2c9 genotypes on  xxxd2911xxx  dose requirements, overanticoagulation, and time to
achieve stability. allele frequencies of interest within the cohort (n ¼ 281) were 40.8%  xxxg2418xxx  t-1173, 12.8% cyp2c9*2,
and 6.9% cyp2c9*3. in patients with the  xxxg2418xxx  cc genotype, carriers of a cyp2c9 polymorphism needed dosages that
were nearly 30% lower than those for cyp2c9*1/*1 patients (po0.001). in patients with a  xxxg2418xxx  polymorphism,
differences between carriers of a cyp2c9 polymorphism and cyp2c9*1/*1 were far smaller and largely not statistically
significant. a larger part of the variability in dose requirement was explained by the  xxxg2418xxx  genotype than by the
cyp2c9 genotype (28.7% and 7.2%, respectively). carriers of a combination of a cyp2c9 polymorphism and a  xxxg2418xxx 
polymorphism had a strongly increased risk of severe overanticoagulation (hazard ratio (hr) 7.20, p ¼ 0.002). only
carriers of a cyp2c9*2 allele had a decreased chance to achieve stability compared to cyp2c9*1/*1 patients (hr 0.61,
p ¼ 0.004). in conclusion, the  xxxg2418xxx  genotype modifies the effect of the cyp2c9 genotype on  xxxd2911xxx  dose
requirements. a combination of polymorphisms of both genotypes is associated with a strongly increased risk of
overanticoagulation, whereas delayed stabilization is mainly associated with the cyp2c9 genotype.

anticoagulants of the coumarin type are effective drugs
for the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic
diseases. however, these drugs have a narrow therapeutic
range and show a large interindividual and intraindividual
variability in dose requirement, which necessitates frequent
monitoring of the anticoagulant effect and dosage
adjustments. known factors contributing to this variability
are age, drug–drug interactions, ingestion of varying
quantities of  xxxd3522xxx , heart failure, infections, impairment
of liver function,1–5 and polymorphisms of the cyp2c9 gene,
which encodes for the main metabolizing enzyme of the
coumarins.6–10

the presence of polymorphisms in the  xxxg2418xxx  gene has
been recently identified as another source of variability in the
response to coumarins. the enzyme  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide
reductase ( xxxg2418xxx ) reduces  xxxd3522xxx  2,3-epoxide to the
biologically active  xxxd3522xxx  hydroquinone, which catalyzes
the production of the blood-clotting proteins ii, vii, ix, and
x by carboxylation of  xxxd2431xxx  residues. coumarins
interfere with this carboxylation by inhibiting  xxxg2418xxx  through
their recently identified target protein  xxxd3522xxx  reductase
complex subunit 1 ( xxxg2418xxx ), which is encoded by the
homonymous gene  xxxg2418xxx .11,12 in several studies, an
association between the presence of polymorphisms of the

 xxxg2418xxx  gene and a reduced dose requirement of
warfarin,10,13–20  xxxd59xxx ,21–23 and phenprocoumon23
has been demonstrated. most of the studies that examined
the effects of both the  xxxg2418xxx  and the cyp2c9 genotypes showed that a larger part of the variation in dose
requirement was explained by the  xxxg2418xxx  than
by the cyp2c9 genotype,14,17,18,20–22 suggesting that the
 xxxg2418xxx  genotype has a larger impact on the anticoagulation
status. however, in a recent study in  xxxd59xxx  users we
demonstrated that being a carrier of a combination of variant
alleles of cyp2c9 and  xxxg2418xxx , rather than of one variant
allele, is associated with severe overanticoagulation, underlining the importance of both genotypes for the anticoagulation status.21
associations between the cyp2c9 genotype and the
anticoagulation status have been convincingly demonstrated
for warfarin and  xxxd59xxx ,6–10 carriers of a cyp2c9*2
or cyp2c9*3 allele requiring lower coumarin dosages and
having an increased tendency to severe overanticoagulation
and retarded stabilization. however, this cyp2c9 sensitivity
is less clear for  xxxd2911xxx , a frequently used coumarin
in european countries. recently, we found an association
between possession of cyp2c9*2 or *3 polymorphisms and a
lower dose requirement, severe overanticoagulation, and
delayed stabilization (for the *2 allele) in a dutch population
of  xxxd2911xxx  users,24 whereas another dutch study did
not find such associations.25 the clinical relevance of the
findings of our study has been questioned26 because only a
minor impact of the cyp2c9 genotype on  xxxd2911xxx 

metabolism has been found in pharmacokinetic studies.27–29
of course, it might be possible that the results of our earlier
 xxxd2911xxx  study have been confounded by the at-thattime unknown  xxxg2418xxx  genotype. in order to examine the
effects of both the  xxxg2418xxx  and cyp2c9 genotypes on
 xxxd2911xxx  sensitivity and their relative contributions
to dose requirements, we also assessed the  xxxg2418xxx  c1173t
polymorphisms in the same cohort of outpatients of two
dutch anticoagulation clinics.
results

of the 284 patients we analyzed in our earlier study,24 three
had no blood or dna samples left for analysis. the
remaining 281 patients were all available for analysis
(table 1).
allele frequencies of  xxxg2418xxx  c-1173 and  xxxg2418xxx  t1173 were 59.2% and 40.8%, respectively. allele frequencies
of cyp2c9*1, cyp2c9*2, and cyp2c9*3 were 80.3%, 12.8%,
and 6.9%, respectively. allele frequencies of both genotypes
were in hardy–weinberg equilibrium (table 1).
for combined  xxxg2418xxx  and cyp2c9 genotypes, numbers
of patients within each combination of genotypes, mean
weekly doses, numbers of patients with severe overanticoagulation, numbers of patients in whom stability was
achieved, and number of days until stability was achieved
are summarized in table 2.
the cyp2c9 and  xxxg2418xxx  genotypes modified each
other’s effects on dose requirements. in our regression
models, we found a statistical interaction between the

was maintained for all found differences and for the product
terms between the cyp2c9 and  xxxg2418xxx  genotypes (data

for the outcome severe overanticoagulation, we found no
statistical interaction between the  xxxg2418xxx  and cyp2c9
genotypes. after adjustment for potential confounders,
including  xxxg2418xxx  genotype, carriers of a cyp2c9*2 or *3
allele had a significantly increased risk of severe overanticoagulation compared to subjects with the cyp2c9*1/
*1 wild type. if both alleles were considered separately, the
risk was only significantly increased in cyp2c9*2 carriers
(p ¼ 0.001), whereas there was a strong trend in cyp2c9*3
carriers (p ¼ 0.060). patients with the  xxxg2418xxx  tt genotype
had a significantly increased risk of severe overanticoagulation compared to  xxxg2418xxx  cc patients, whereas this risk was
not significantly increased in patients with the  xxxg2418xxx  ct
genotype (table 4). if combined  xxxg2418xxx –cyp2c9 genotypes were considered, the risk for severe overanticoagulation
was most strongly increased in patients with a combination
of cyp2c9*2 or cyp2c9*3 with either  xxxg2418xxx  ct or
 xxxg2418xxx  tt compared to patients with no polymorphism of
 xxxg2418xxx  or cyp2c9 ( xxxg2418xxx  cc–cyp2c9*1/*1) (table 4,

we also found no statistical interaction between the

within the cyp2c9 genotype, we found differences in time
to achieve stability; within the  xxxg2418xxx  genotype, we did not
find any differences (figure 2). in patients with a cyp2c9*2
allele, the chance to achieve stability within the follow-up
period was significantly decreased compared to cyp2c9*1/*1
patients (adjusted hr 0.61, 95% ci 0.43–0.86, p ¼ 0.004),

cyp2c9*3 allele (hr 3.46, p ¼ 0.016). for the combined
 xxxg2418xxx –cyp2c9 genotypes, significance for the increased
risk in  xxxg2418xxx  cc–cyp2c9*2 or *3 patients compared to
 xxxg2418xxx  cc–cyp2c9*1/*1 patients was lost (hr 2.70,
p ¼ 0.20), but the risk in patients with a  xxxg2418xxx  and a
cyp2c9 polymorphism was even more strongly increased
than in our main cohort (hr 8.68, p ¼ 0.005) (further data
not shown).

analysis of our data after allocating patients with the
cyp2c9*2/*3 genotype to the cyp2c9*2 group (instead of
the cyp2c9*3 group) did not change our results (data not
shown).
analysis of our data with a separate group of homozygous
carriers of two cyp2c9 variant alleles (cyp2c9*2/2,
cyp2c9*2/*3, and cyp2c9*3/*3) also did not change our
results. point estimates for homozygous carriers were
generally similar to those for the heterozygous carriers of a
wild type and a variant allele, in most cases with loss of

the results of our study, in which we evaluated the effects of
 xxxg2418xxx  as well as cyp2c9 genotypes on the anticoagulation
status of patients taking  xxxd2911xxx , strongly suggest
that the association between possession of a variant cyp2c9
allele and a decreased mean weekly dose requirement we
found in our earlier study within this cohort24 is modified by
the  xxxg2418xxx  genotype.
the allele frequencies we found for the c-1173 allele
(59.25%) and the t-1173 allele (40.75%) were in accordance
with other studies in several populations, t-1173 allele
frequencies varying from 39.1% to 45.8%.15,21,22,30
concerning the lower maintenance dose in carriers of a
 xxxg2418xxx  polymorphism, our findings are in good agreement
with the study of reitsma et al.,23 the only other study that
examined the association between  xxxg2418xxx  c1173t genotype and  xxxd2911xxx  anticoagulation. their main

findings were an increased risk of bleeding and decreased dose
requirement in carriers of at least one t allele compared to
 xxxg2418xxx  cc patients. in contrast to our study, reitsma et al.23
did not take the cyp2c9 genotype into account. however, it is
possible to compare our results with those of reitsma et al.23 if
we calculate the weighted mean of the daily  xxxd2911xxx 
dosages of patients with the  xxxg2418xxx  cc,  xxxg2418xxx  ct, and
 xxxg2418xxx  tt genotypes, adjusting for the frequencies of the
cyp2c9 genotypes. these recalculations result in the following
dose requirements in stabilized patients:  xxxg2418xxx  cc (2.9 mg/
day) (reitsma et al.23 (2.9 mg/day)),  xxxg2418xxx  ct (2.3 mg/day)
(reitsma et al.23 (2.6 mg/day)),  xxxg2418xxx  tt (1.5 mg/day)
(reitsma et al.23 (1.4 mg/day)). our recalculated mean dose
requirements for the different  xxxg2418xxx  genotypes are in
remarkable agreement with those of reitsma et al.,23 corroborating a decreased  xxxd2911xxx  dose requirement in
patients with a  xxxg2418xxx  polymorphism compared to
 xxxg2418xxx  wild-type patients.
compared to cyp2c9 wild-type patients, carriers of a
cyp2c9*2 or *3 allele needed considerably lower doses if
they also had the  xxxg2418xxx  cc genotype. however, if patients
had the  xxxg2418xxx  ct or tt genotype, differences in dose
requirement between cyp2c9 wild-type patients and carriers
of a cyp2c9*2 or *3 allele were much smaller and not in all
cases statistically significant. in fact, the cyp2c9*1/*1cyp2c9*2 or *3 shift within the  xxxg2418xxx  cc stratum has
about the same impact as the  xxxg2418xxx  cc- xxxg2418xxx  ct
shift in general (table 3). the finding that the impact of
being a carrier of a variant allele of cyp2c9 on  xxxd2911xxx  dose requirement changes with the  xxxg2418xxx 
genotype has not been reported in similar studies with the
other coumarins warfarin13–20 and  xxxd59xxx .21,22 a
possible explanation for this remarkable effect modification
could be that the sensitivity to the s- and r-enantiomers of
 xxxd2911xxx  changes with the  xxxg2418xxx  genotype. like
the other coumarins,  xxxd2911xxx  is a racemic mixture
of a s- and a r-enantiomer, s- xxxd2911xxx  being
biologically more active (1.6 to 2.6  ) than r- xxxd2911xxx .31 the impact of the cyp2c9 genotype on clearance is
far greater for s- xxxd2911xxx  than for r- xxxd2911xxx . although cyp2c9 polymorphisms reduce the metabolism of s- xxxd2911xxx  considerably, the overall
metabolism of (both s- and r-)  xxxd2911xxx  depends
less on the cyp2c9 genotype than the overall metabolism of
 xxxd59xxx  or warfarin.27,29 so, the more s- xxxd2911xxx  contributes to the overall anticoagulant activity, the
greater the role of the cyp2c9 genotype. it is possible that sand r- xxxd2911xxx  display larger differences in anticoagulant activity for the  xxxg2418xxx  target protein produced
by  xxxg2418xxx  wild-type patients than for the  xxxg2418xxx  target
protein produced by  xxxg2418xxx  ct or tt patients. we are
aware that this explanation is speculative and has to be tested
in pharmacodynamic studies. of course, we also have to
consider the possibility that the effect modification we found
was a chance finding, because our results are derived from a
reanalysis of a data set in which we did not define a priori that
190

we wanted to test for an interaction between genotypes. so,
confirmation of our findings in an independent data set is
warranted.
few studies have examined the association between the
 xxxd2911xxx  anticoagulation status and the cyp2c9
genotype. the pharmacokinetic studies by kirchheiner
et al.29 and ufer et al.27 were conducted in healthy volunteers
and demonstrated a more limited role for the enzyme
cyp2c9 in the overall elimination of s- and r- xxxd2911xxx  than in the elimination of warfarin and  xxxd59xxx .
however, their finding that the elimination of s- xxxd2911xxx  is considerably reduced in carriers of cyp2c9
polymorphism supports the significant dose differences we
found between carriers of a cyp2c9*2 or *3 allele and
cyp2c9*1/*1 patients with the  xxxg2418xxx  cc genotype. in
two studies of hummers-pradier et al.32 and visser et al.,25
no significant differences in dose requirements between
patients with different cyp2c9 genotypes were found. in
contrast, we found significant differences in dose requirements between carriers of a cyp2c9*2 or *3 allele and
cyp2c9 wild-type patients in our earlier study, which
was conducted within the same population as this one.24
our results strongly suggest that the contribution to
differences between cyp2c9 genotypes is mainly provided
by patients with the  xxxg2418xxx  cc genotype. in caucasian
populations, the percentage of patients who have the
 xxxg2418xxx  cc genotype is smaller than 40% (in our
study 37.7%), which means that overall differences between
cyp2c9 genotypes will only be found in large populations if
the  xxxg2418xxx  genotype is not taken into account. as a
consequence, the larger number of patients in our study
compared to the studies of visser et al.25 and hummerspradier et al.32 seems a plausible explanation for the apparent
discrepancies between our study and theirs. the explained
variability in dose requirement by the combination of
 xxxg2418xxx , cyp2c9 genotype, age, and several other factors
is in accordance with other studies in users of warfarin,16,18,22
as is our finding that the  xxxg2418xxx  genotype explains a larger
part of the dose variability than the cyp2c9 genotype.17,18,21,22 in contrast with a study we recently conducted
in  xxxd59xxx  users,21 we found no modification of the
association between the cyp2c9 genotype and severe overanticoagulation by the  xxxg2418xxx  genotype. the risks of
having cyp2c9 and  xxxg2418xxx  variant alleles seem to be
additive rather than multiplicative. this indicates that
coumarins differ in their sensitivities to combinations of
 xxxg2418xxx  and cyp2c9 genotypes, which is in itself not
surprising in view of the earlier noticed differences in
cyp2c9 sensitivities.
in this study, we only found an association between being
a carrier of the cyp2c9*2 allele and a decreased chance to
achieve stability compared with cyp2c9*1/*1 subjects. this
indicates that the process of finding the right dose
requirement is most difficult in cyp2c9*2 carriers. that
the search for a stable  xxxd2911xxx  dose regimen is more
associated with the cyp2c9 genotype than with the  xxxg2418xxx

genotype is in agreement with our findings in another study
we recently conducted in  xxxd59xxx  users.21
some limitations of our study have to be considered.
because we only had medical data from anticoagulation
clinics, we could have missed relevant data about comorbidities and comedication. however, we were able to exclude
subjects with potentially destabilizing hepatic dysfunction
and thyroid disease from entry in our study, which has
enhanced the homogeneity of our cohort. a second
limitation is the lack of knowledge about the duration of
potentially confounding comedication use. however, we were
able to eliminate users of cyp2c9 inhibiting drugs from
analysis. moreover, reanalysis of all outcomes after exclusion
of all incident users of antibiotics and nsaids during followup did not result in essentially other outcomes.
in conclusion, our study shows that in  xxxd2911xxx 
users the differences in dose requirements between patients
with different cyp2c9 genotypes are modified by the
 xxxg2418xxx  genotype, that differences between carriers of a
cyp2c9*2 or *3 allele and patients with the cyp2c9*1/*1
genotype are mainly relevant in  xxxg2418xxx  cc patients and
that the  xxxg2418xxx  genotype explains a larger part of the dose
variability than the cyp2c9 genotype. overanticoagulation is
most strongly associated with possession of polymorphisms
of  xxxg2418xxx  and cyp2c9, whereas time to achieve stability is
only associated with the cyp2c9 genotype. these results
suggest that preceding knowledge of both  xxxg2418xxx  and
cyp2c9 genotypes could contribute to a safer treatment with
 xxxd2911xxx .
methods
study design and patients. this study was conducted in the same
cohort of  xxxd2911xxx -using outpatients in whom we earlier
examined the association between cyp2c9 genotype and anticoagulation status. for full details not described in this article, we
refer to the report of our study previously published in this
journal.24
in brief, the original study was a prospective follow-up study at
two dutch anticoagulation clinics in patients who started  xxxd2911xxx  therapy between october 2002 and july 2003. exclusion
criteria were hepatic dysfunction, thyroid disease, and use of
pharmacokinetically interacting drugs at the start of  xxxd2911xxx  therapy. these data were retrieved from the medical files of the
anticoagulation clinics. pharmacokinetically interacting drugs were
inhibitors of cyp2c9 like gemfibrozile, strong inhibitors of cyp3a4
like itraconazole, and inducers of liver enzymes like carbamazepine.
they were identified by means of the dutch standard management
coumarin interactions, which is used as a reference by all dutch
anticoagulation clinics and pharmacies33 and can also be found in
the review by harder and thurmann.34 the medical ethical
committee of the leiden university medical centre approved our
study.24
data collection and follow-up period. we collected patients’
characteristics and clinical data as recorded by the anticoagulation
clinics in a database. the weekly dosage for each patient was assessed
from the dose schemes. for  xxxg2418xxx  genotyping, we used the
samples in which we assessed the cyp2c9 genotypes in our earlier
study. the  xxxg2418xxx  c1173t genotype was assessed in intron 1 of
the  xxxg2418xxx  gene. this polymorphism appears to be as informative

caucasian populations.17

genotyping. for cyp2c9 genotyping, we refer to our previous
study.24 a lightcycler (roche diagnostics, mannheim, germany)
assay was used for the detection of the  xxxg2418xxx  c1173t
polymorphism. during the melting curve analysis, the hybridization
probes dissociate from the target dna at specific melting
temperatures. the presence of a c-allele introduces a destabilizing
mismatch with the fluorescenting probes, which results in a
decreased melting temperature. during setup, all lightcycler
analyses (n ¼ 25, nine cc, 11 ct, and five tt) were compared
with restriction fragment length polymorphism. both methods of
analysis were checked by testing externally obtained patient samples
of known  xxxg2418xxx  c1173t (cc, ct, and tt) genotype (courtesy of
wadelius et al., uppsala). the genotypes of the provided samples
were established with minisequencing based on primer oligo base
extension and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time of
flight mass spectrometry. comparison between lightcycler genotyping and restriction fragment length polymorphism samples
showed completely concordant results.21
assessment of the presence or absence of the single-nucleotide
polymorphism c1173t results in three different genotypes:  xxxg2418xxx

calculations and statistical analysis. for assessment of deviations of
allele frequencies from hardy–weinberg equilibrium, we used the
w2 test.
for comparisons between genotypes, patients were divided into
three categories for both cyp2c9 and  xxxg2418xxx . for the cyp2c9
genotype, homozygous carriers of the cyp2c9 wild-type allele
(cyp2c9*1/*1) formed the reference group; the other two groups
consisted of carriers of the cyp2c9*2 and cyp2c9*3 alleles. because
of the low prevalence of subjects carrying two allelic variants,
heterozygous and homozygous subjects were included in the same
genotype category. cyp2c9*2/*3 subjects were allocated to the
cyp2c9*3 group, but we also analyzed our outcomes after allocating
*3 subjects to the cyp2c9*2 group. moreover, we reanalyzed all our
outcomes after having made a separate category of homozygous
carriers of cyp2c9 allelic variants (cyp2c9*2/*2, cyp2c9*2/*3,
and cyp2c9*3/*3). for the  xxxg2418xxx  c1173t genotype, homozygous carriers of the  xxxg2418xxx  wild-type allele ( xxxg2418xxx  cc)
formed the reference group, the other two groups consisted of
patients with the  xxxg2418xxx  ct and the  xxxg2418xxx  tt genotype.
when we found an interaction between the cyp2c9 and
 xxxg2418xxx  genotypes, we compared all combined cyp2c9– xxxg2418xxx 
genotypes with patients who were homozygous carriers of the
191

articles

wild-type allele of both genotypes ( xxxg2418xxx  cc–cyp2c9*1/*1) as a
reference.
mean dose requirements were calculated for patients who
achieved stability during the follow-up period, because dose
requirements in nonstabilized patients are, by definition, less certain
and possibly not representative for the definitive dose requirements
after stabilization. to assess whether our results changed considerably if we included all patients, we compared the dose requirements
in stabilized patients with the mean dose requirement in all patients
from the 30th day after the entry date until the end of the follow-up
period.
to assess differences in mean weekly  xxxd2911xxx  dosages
during the first period of stability and percentage of variability
explained by  xxxg2418xxx  and cyp2c9 genotypes, we used linear
regression modeling.
to compare our  xxxd2911xxx  dosages with the study that did
not take the cyp2c9 genotype into account, we recalculated a
weighted mean for patients with the  xxxg2418xxx  cc,  xxxg2418xxx  ct, and
 xxxg2418xxx  tt genotypes by means of the following equation:

in which xx is cc, ct, or tt, d is the dose, and n is the number of

we also determined the contributions of the cyp2c9 and
 xxxg2418xxx  genotypes, age, and sex to the  xxxd2911xxx  dose
requirements, for which we used a linear regression model with
these factors and with product terms between the  xxxg2418xxx  and
cyp2c9 genotypes. the adjusted mean r2 value of the model
explained the variability of the mean weekly dosage. partial r2 values
for each of the contributing factors were assessed by a backward
selection procedure.
to assess hrs of severe overanticoagulation and time to achieve
stability, we used cox proportional hazard modeling.
we examined effect modification by introducing product terms
in our models between the  xxxg2418xxx  and cyp2c9 genotypes and
between each of these genotypes and other factors such as sex and
age. in all models, we adjusted for the potential confounders age and
sex and the comorbidity heart failure, which has been identified as
an independent risk factor for severe overanticoagulation.37
to adjust for confounding comedication, the best strategy would
have been to include potential interacting drugs as time-varying
covariates in our models. however, files from anticoagulation clinics
from which we retrieved our data did not provide reliable
information on duration of comedication use. therefore, we
excluded all subjects who started using cyp2c9 inhibiting drugs
during the follow-up time from our analyses.33,34
moreover, we tested the robustness of our findings by reanalyzing
our outcomes after exclusion of those patients who used
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which are known cyp2c9
substrates and antibiotics, which can both contribute to overanticoagulation and instability.3,38
statistical analyses were performed with the statistical software
package spss 12 (version 12.0; spss, chicago, il).
