summary
abstract

pharmacological
properties

 xxxd2792xxx  ( xxxd2792xxx ®) is a reversible inhibitor of gastric and pancreatic lipases. in
conjunction with a hypocaloric diet and moderate exercise,  xxxd2792xxx  is an effective
drug for use in the management of obesity in adults with or without comorbidities.
recent data have shown that  xxxd2792xxx  is also effective as a component of weight
management strategies in obese adolescents. in addition to its well established
efficacy in achieving modest weight loss,  xxxd2792xxx  has been shown to improve
glycaemic parameters in obese adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as
some features of the metabolic syndrome.  xxxd2792xxx  is generally well tolerated.
thus,  xxxd2792xxx  is an option for the treatment of obese patients with or without type 2
diabetes and also has a role in the management of obese patients with the
metabolic syndrome, associated comorbidities or concomitant disorders.
 xxxd2792xxx  is a reversible inhibitor of gastric and pancreatic lipases; its mechanism of
action results in an inhibition of dietary fat absorption of 30% at the approved
dosage. it is generally associated with a loss of fat mass in obese adults and
adolescents, as well as decreases in levels of the regulatory hormone leptin as
patients lose bodyweight. vitamin levels are not consistently affected with  xxxd2792xxx 
use, with only beta-carotene and  xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx  and e levels shown to be significantly
decreased by  xxxd2792xxx  administration in at least one study. mineral levels are also
not affected in obese adolescent patients.  xxxd2792xxx  is effective in improving factors
involved or implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease.
the absorption of  xxxd2792xxx  is minimal in both healthy adult volunteers and adult
obese patients.  xxxd2792xxx  is not extensively metabolised, with 83% of excreted
 xxxd2792xxx  found to be intact drug. accumulation of  xxxd2792xxx  is minimal in both shortand long-term studies.  xxxd2792xxx  is excreted primarily via the faeces.
because  xxxd2792xxx  is minimally absorbed, it has a generally favourable
drug-interaction profile. only the pharmacokinetics of ciclosporin (cyclosporin)
and amiodarone have been shown to be affected by coadministration with  xxxd2792xxx .
the bioavailability of oral contraceptives in women receiving  xxxd2792xxx  who experience severe diarrhoea may be reduced.

 xxxd2792xxx : a review

therapeutic efficacy

tolerability

1627

in numerous randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre studies in
obese adult patients,  xxxd2792xxx  has been shown to be significantly more effective
than placebo in reducing weight.  xxxd2792xxx  is also effective in producing modest
weight loss in obese adolescent patients and in patients with additional disorders,
such as type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. several metabolic parameters
are consistently improved after  xxxd2792xxx  treatment; in patients with type 2 diabetes,
mean levels of postprandial glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin are decreased.
 xxxd2792xxx  treatment enables some patients with type 2 diabetes to decrease or
discontinue their antidiabetic medication, or be reclassified to either impaired or
normal glucose tolerance.  xxxd2792xxx  shows efficacy in reducing cardiovascular risk
factors irrespective of diabetic status or a confirmed diagnosis of metabolic
syndrome.
the benefit of  xxxd2792xxx  in reducing the disease burden of obese patients with
concomitant disorders has also been shown.  xxxd2792xxx  significantly delayed the
progression to type 2 diabetes compared with placebo in obese patients with
impaired glucose tolerance at baseline in the 4-year randomised, double-blind,
multicentre xendos trial.
 xxxd2792xxx  is generally as effective as sibutramine in producing weight loss; when
the drugs are used in combination in obese patients with or without type 2
diabetes, weight loss is generally increased compared with  xxxd2792xxx  alone.  xxxd2792xxx 
and sibutramine are also generally equivalent with regard to improvements in
diabetic parameters, but  xxxd2792xxx  recipients had significant improvements in blood
pressure compared with sibutramine recipients.
several well designed, fully published pharmacoeconomic studies analysing a
range of perspectives, from the healthcare system to the patient, have shown that
 xxxd2792xxx  is a cost-effective treatment for obese adult patients with or without type 2
diabetes.
 xxxd2792xxx  is generally well tolerated in adults and adolescents. adverse effects
experienced by  xxxd2792xxx  recipients were generally mild and transient, with most
resolving within a few weeks of treatment. the most common adverse events in
recipients of  xxxd2792xxx  are associated with the gastrointestinal tract. tolerability
profiles are similar in adults and adolescents, as well as in patients with type 2
diabetes or the metabolic syndrome.

1. introduction
obesity is associated with an increased risk in allcause mortality.[1] all adult individuals who are
overweight (body mass index [bmi] ≥25 mg/m2) or
obese (bmi ≥30 kg/m2) are at risk of morbidity
from atherosclerotic diseases associated with type 2
diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia (increased lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol [ldl-c] and triglyceride [tg] levels, decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [hdl-c] levels), hypertension
and coronary heart disease (chd).[1] obesity, type 2
© 2006 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

diabetes, dyslipidaemia and hypertension are independent risk factors for chd;[1,2] additional factors
influencing the risk of chd include impaired glycaemic control, prothrombotic and proinflammatory
factors and the metabolic syndrome, a condition
considered to be a precursor to type 2 diabetes that
involves a clustering of altered glycaemic control
with several independent risk factors for chd
(obesity, high tg and low hdl-c levels and hypertension) in a single individual.[2]

long-term weight loss is the goal of obesity
management. a weight loss of 5–10% of initial
bodyweight has been shown to improve cardiovascular risk factors and reduce blood glucose levels,
glycosylated haemoglobin (hba1c) and the progression from impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes.[3,4] despite the benefits associated with
weight reduction, sustained weight loss in obese
individuals is difficult to achieve in the absence of a
continuing weight management programme.[1,4]
pharmacotherapy for obesity is recommended for
individuals whose bmi is ≥30 kg/m2 with no additional obesity-related risk factors, or where the bmi
is ≥27 kg/m2 and there are additional risk factors.[4]
 xxxd2792xxx  ( xxxd2792xxx ®)1 is a non-systemic, reversible
inhibitor of gastric and pancreatic lipases used for
weight loss in obese and overweight patients. this
review focuses on the pharmacology and efficacy of
 xxxd2792xxx  in obese adult and adolescent patients, patients with type 2 diabetes and patients with the
metabolic syndrome. throughout this article, lipid
levels are reported in mmol/l; to convert to mg/dl,

then excreted in the faeces (see section 3), resulting
in an inhibition of dietary fat absorption of 30% at
an  xxxd2792xxx  dosage of 120mg three times daily.[8,9]
2.1 effects on fat mass

the efficacy of  xxxd2792xxx  was variable in terms of
fat mass loss in obese adult patients on a hypocaloric
diet compared with placebo (figure 1).[10-13] in
randomised,[10,11,13,14] double-blind,[10,13] placebocontrolled[10,11,13,14] trials,  xxxd2792xxx  recipients had an
absolute reduction in mean body fat of
2.0–14.8%,[10,11,13,14] whereas placebo recipients had
an absolute reduction of 1.6–17.6% (figure
1).[10,11,13,14] patients receiving  xxxd2792xxx  in an additional randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled
study (total n = 72) had mean body fat mass decrease
from a baseline of 38.0kg to 29.1kg, while mean
body fat mass in the placebo group decreased from
37.5kg to 32.3kg (p ≤ 0.05 vs placebo).[12] two

2. pharmacodynamic properties
the pharmacodynamic properties of  xxxd2792xxx  have
been reviewed previously.[5-7] this section therefore
provides a brief overview of key pharmacodynamic
data related to the approved  xxxd2792xxx  dosage of
120mg three times daily (section 7). the beneficial
effects of  xxxd2792xxx  on blood pressure (bp) and metabolic parameters such as plasma glucose levels and
lipid levels are discussed further in section 4.
 xxxd2792xxx  is a reversible inhibitor of gastric and
pancreatic lipases.[5-9] its action is localised to the
lumen of the stomach and small intestine.  xxxd2792xxx 
inhibits lipase activity via covalent binding with the
active site serine in these enzymes, preventing them
from hydrolysing tgs from dietary fat, which are
not absorbed, into free  xxxd2154xxx  and monoglycerides, which are absorbed.[5-7,9] undigested tgs are

 xxxd2792xxx : a review

randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in obese adolescent patients (n = 579[15] and
40;[16] aged 12–16[15] and 14–18[16] years) investigated the effect of  xxxd2792xxx  on fat mass loss; in the larger
study,[15]  xxxd2792xxx  recipients lost a significantly (p =
0.03) greater amount of fat mass than placebo recipients (–2.4kg vs 0.4kg).[15] in the smaller study, significant (p < 0.002) reductions from baseline were
seen in both  xxxd2792xxx  and placebo recipients (2.7%
and 1.9%), but there was no statistically significant
between-group difference.[16]
2.2 effects on vitamins and minerals

since  xxxd2792xxx  prevents the absorption of dietary
fat, there is potential for fat-soluble vitamin absorption to also be diminished in  xxxd2792xxx  recipients;
because of this, the prescribing information for  xxxd2792xxx  in the us contains a recommendation that patients be advised to take a multivitamin supplement.[8,9] however, despite the risk of decreased
absorption,  xxxd3105xxx  and k levels generally remained unchanged in both obese patients[15-19] and
healthy volunteers.[20] while levels of beta-carotene or
vitamins e or d were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased from baseline in several studies in the same
populations,[15-18,20,21] in some cases despite multivitamin supplementation,[18,19] there were also instances where the levels of these vitamins increased,
remained unchanged or stayed within reference
ranges.[15-18]
levels of several minerals (calcium, magnesium,
zinc, copper and phosphorous) were not affected by
 xxxd2792xxx  use in obese adolescents.[22] there were no
differences in urinary excretion of sodium, potassium or creatinine between  xxxd2792xxx  and placebo.[22] a
significant (p < 0.002) increase from baseline in
serum iron levels was observed in some adolescents;
however, levels remained within normal ranges.[19]
2.3 other effects

leptin is an important hormone in the regulation
of bodyweight and fat stores.[23] in humans, there is
a strong correlation between serum levels of leptin
and body fat, and serum leptin levels are increased
in obese patients compared with lean individuals.[23]
© 2006 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

1629

serum levels of leptin decreased as bodyweight
decreased in obese patients receiving  xxxd2792xxx  120mg
three times daily.[11,14,19,24] significant (p < 0.03)
reductions in leptin levels versus placebo[11] and
baseline[24] were seen in obese adults with[24] or
without[11,24] type 2 diabetes and in obese adolescents.[19]
 xxxd2792xxx  was effective in improving factors involved or implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease.[25-29] myocardial performance index,[26] plasminogen activator inhibitor activity,[29]
and levels of malondialdehyde,[27] interleukin (il)-6
and  xxxg520xxx [30] all improved significantly
(p < 0.01 vs baseline), reflecting improvements in
left ventricular dysfunction, blood coagulation, lipid
peroxidation and markers of inflammation.  xxxd2792xxx 
use also prevented the postprandial rise in serum
advanced glycation products (p < 0.01 vs baseline),[28] and decreased the time of postprandial
lipaemia (p ≤ 0.01),[25] lowering the area under the
concentration-time curve (auc) for the rise in postprandial tgs and decreasing the size of very-lowdensity lipoprotein particles (p < 0.01 vs baseline).[25]
3. pharmacokinetic properties
the pharmacokinetics of orally administered  xxxd2792xxx  have been reviewed in detail previously.[5-7]
this section therefore provides a brief overview of
the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug.
the absorption of  xxxd2792xxx  is minimal in both
healthy adult volunteers and adult obese patients.[31-33] in single-dose studies,  xxxd2792xxx  doses of
up to 800mg resulted in plasma concentrations of
<5 ng/ml;[33] similar plasma concentrations were
reported in healthy volunteers and obese patients
who received  xxxd2792xxx  25–400mg three times daily in
multiple-dose studies.[33] accumulation of  xxxd2792xxx 
was minimal in both short- and long-term studies.[31,33]
the metabolism of  xxxd2792xxx  is limited, with 83%
of excreted drug found to be intact  xxxd2792xxx .[33] two
pharmacologically inactive metabolites of  xxxd2792xxx 
have been detected in 14c mass balance studies: the
product of hydrolysis of the beta-lactone ring (m1) and
drugs 2006; 66 (12)

1630

a subsequent metabolite produced by cleavage of the
n-formyl leucine side chain off m1 (m3).[9,32] these
metabolites account for 42% of total plasma radioactivity.[9]  xxxd2792xxx  is primarily eliminated via the
faeces, with 96–97% recovered from faecal samples
and the rest excreted in the urine.[32,33]  xxxd2792xxx  had a
plasma half-life of 1–2 hours, and total excretion of
 xxxd2792xxx  (renal plus faecal routes) was achieved in
3–5 days.[9]
the drug interaction profile of  xxxd2792xxx  is generally favourable. in healthy volunteers,  xxxd2792xxx  did not
affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin,[34] metformin,[35] phentermine,[35] fluoxetine,[36] simvastatin,[36] sibutramine,[35] phenytoin,[37]  xxxd2215xxx 
( xxxd2215xxx ),[38]  xxxd2722xxx  tablets,[39] atorvastatin,[35] amitriptyline,[35] losartan[35]
or warfarin.[40] in addition,  xxxd2792xxx  did not alter the
pharmacokinetics of pravastatin in patients with
mild hypercholesterolaemia.[41] the suppression of
ovulation by oral contraceptives was not altered by
 xxxd2792xxx  in healthy women in clinical studies,[42] although there has recently been an amendment made
to the summary of product characteristics for  xxxd2792xxx 
regarding reduced availability of oral contraceptives
in women receiving  xxxd2792xxx  who experience severe
diarrhoea.[9] the inhibition of dietary fat by  xxxd2792xxx 
was not affected by concomitant ingestion of ethanol in healthy volunteers.[43]
by contrast, the pharmacokinetics of ciclosporin
(cyclosporin) and amiodarone were affected by
coadministered  xxxd2792xxx . several case reports in renal
transplant patients[44-46] and a study in healthy subjects[35] have shown decreased absorption of
ciclosporin with coadministered  xxxd2792xxx ; in healthy
subjects, the absorption of ciclosporin was inhibited
by approximately 30%.[35] similarly, systemic exposure to amiodarone in healthy subjects receiving
 xxxd2792xxx  was reduced by approximately 25%.[36]
4. therapeutic efficacy
the efficacy of  xxxd2792xxx  in obese patients has been
evaluated in numerous randomised,[13,15-17,47-53,55-60]
double-blind,[13,15-17,47-60]
multicentre,[13,15,17,47-57]

40–3305).

henness & perry

additional active-comparator randomised,[61-65]
double-blind,[61,64] multicentre[61,64] trials of  xxxd2792xxx 
have also been completed.[61-65] several trials have
investigated the efficacy of  xxxd2792xxx  in combination
with sibutramine (n = 86–144),[61,62,64,65] or  xxxd2096xxx  (n = 89).[63]
several trials have evaluated the efficacy of  xxxd2792xxx  in combination with a modified diet and exercise
regime in obese patients with or without additional
diseases, either in isolation,[19,66-72] or compared
with diet and exercise alone[73,74] or the standard care
for the particular patient group studied.[75] one trial
compared the effect of  xxxd2792xxx  in obese patients with
and without type 2 diabetes.[24]
only trials of the approved  xxxd2792xxx  dosage of
120mg three times daily are reviewed here, and all
subsequent mentions of  xxxd2792xxx  relate to this dosage.
other criteria for trial selection include trials of ≥40
patients, except those examining particular patient
populations such as adolescents,[19,70] postmenopausal women,[72] or patients with binge eating
disorder,[13,59] depression,[71] heart failure,[75] or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.[68] several of the studies
are fully published, whereas others are available as
abstracts.[71,72] with the exception of one study
where it was not stated explicitly,[27] all studies
stipulated some kind of dietary restriction.[11,13,15,17,19,24,47-76] in some 2-year studies, patients were maintained on a hypocaloric diet for the
first year, and a eucaloric diet the second year.[50-53]
some studies included a 2- to 4-week placebo- or
diet-alone run-in period,[13,15,54,57,61,64,69] while others
had a follow-up 3–6 months after the conclusion of
the primary study.[11,59] the studies ranged from 12
weeks’ to 4 years’ duration.
in most studies, patients generally had a bmi of
≥28 kg/m2; in only two studies of chinese patients
were patients with a bmi <28 kg/m2 enrolled.[11,56]
three of the adolescent studies defined obesity as a
bmi greater than the 85th[16] and 95th[19,70] percentile for age, sex and race. in addition to studies
investigating the effect of  xxxd2792xxx  in obese patients
with type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome,
several studies included obese patients with concomitant comorbidities; where stated, these includdrugs 2006; 66 (12)

4.1.1 adults

numerous placebo-controlled studies have investigated the efficacy of  xxxd2792xxx  in obese adult patients.[11,17,47-55] studies in ≥300 patients are summarised in table i.[17,47-55]
effects on weight

 xxxd2792xxx  was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing weight, although the amount of
weight lost was modest in both groups.[11,47-55] in
patients on a hypocaloric diet receiving  xxxd2792xxx ,
weight loss ranged from 4.7kg to 10.3kg, whereas
patients receiving placebo lost 0.9–6.4kg (p < 0.05
vs placebo; table i).[17,47-55] in general, a significantly greater proportion of  xxxd2792xxx  recipients lost ≥5%
of their initial bodyweight compared with placebo
recipients (45.7–65.7% vs 22.6–43.6% table
i).[17,47-51,55] similar results were seen for a
bodyweight loss of ≥10%, with 26.2–38.9% of  xxxd2792xxx  recipients achieving that endpoint compared with
11.3–24.8% of placebo recipients (p < 0.01; table

i).[17,49-52] in the large xendos ( xxxd2792xxx  in the
prevention of diabetes in obese subjects)[17] and
x-pert ( xxxd2792xxx  prospective evaluation in real
practice treatment)[66] trials, weight loss was more
rapid at the start of  xxxd2792xxx  treatment, with more than
half of the total mean weight loss achieved by 1 year
lost within the first 3-month treatment period (figure
2); the placebo group in the xendos study had a
similar rapid weight loss, with an ≈6.2kg weight loss
from baseline at 3 months (estimated from a graph)
that was maintained at 1 year.[17] despite this rapid
weight loss in the initial stages of the xendos
study, analysis of the weight loss over 4 years in
patients who completed the study shows that weight
loss peaked at 1 year in  xxxd2792xxx  and placebo recipients (11.4 vs 7.5kg; p < 0.001), with both groups
subsequently regaining weight by the 4-year study
endpoint (6.9 vs 4.1kg; p < 0.001 vs placebo).[17]
 xxxd2792xxx  recipients experienced significantly
greater reductions in bmi (1.9[55] and 2.3[49] kg/m2
vs 0.9[55] and 1.0[49] kg/m2) and waist circumference
(4.8–6.0 vs 1.9–4.1cm)[47,48,54] than placebo recipients (table i).
the effect of  xxxd2792xxx  in obese patients on a eucaloric diet during year 2 has been reviewed in detail
previously.[5] patients on a eucaloric diet during the
second year of  xxxd2792xxx  therapy continued to maintain
a significant loss in weight from baseline compared
with the placebo group (table i).[50-53] a higher percentage of patients receiving  xxxd2792xxx  for 2 years lost
≥5% (34.3%[51] and 57.1%[53]) or ≥10%
(18.6–34.1%)[50-52] of their initial bodyweight compared with placebo recipients (≥5%: 24.1%[51] and
37.4%[53]; ≥10%: 6.6–18.6%[50-52]). weight regain
was significantly (p < 0.001) reduced in patients
continuing  xxxd2792xxx  treatment for 2 years versus patients re-randomised to receive placebo in the second year, although it was not prevented completely.[50,53]
in comparative studies of  xxxd2792xxx  and sibutramine, patients taking  xxxd2792xxx  showed weight loss
and decreased bmi, but weight loss was increased
significantly when  xxxd2792xxx  was combined with sibutramine compared with  xxxd2792xxx  alone (table
ii).[61,62,65] three studies of 12–52 weeks’ duration

showed that  xxxd2792xxx  recipients had a weight loss of
5.5–9.4kg, whereas sibutramine recipients lost
8.3–11.7kg (table ii).[61,62,65] in two of the studies,[62,65] sibutramine was associated with significantly (p < 0.05) greater weight loss from baseline
than  xxxd2792xxx .
in the two largest post-marketing studies of  xxxd2792xxx , mean weight loss at study endpoint (7[67] and
12[66] months) for completers was 10.8–11.8kg, and
was similar regardless of the magnitude of caloric
restriction (table iii).[66,67] in both studies, ≥84% of
patients lost ≥5% of their bodyweight, while ≥50%
lost ≥10% (table iii).[66,67]
effects on lipid levels

 xxxd2792xxx  produced variable effects on plasma tg
levels in obese adult patients (table iv). in most

studies, changes in tg levels were not significantly
different from baseline or the relevant comparator;
however, in two studies of  xxxd2792xxx  and sibutramine,[61,65] there was a modest, but statistically
significant (p < 0.05), decrease from baseline in
recipients of  xxxd2792xxx , sibutramine and the combination treatment (table iv).
 xxxd2792xxx  is known to decrease the absorption of
dietary cholesterol, an effect that is assumed to
result from its inhibition of intestinal lipases and the
subsequent reduction in fat digestion in recipients of
the drug.[82] several large, randomised, placebo-controlled trials have also shown that  xxxd2792xxx  recipients
had a decrease in tc levels after treatment that was
independent of the cholesterol-lowering effect of
weight loss alone.[50,53,83,84] similar independent ef-

 xxxd2792xxx : a review

fects of  xxxd2792xxx  on ldl-c levels have also been
seen.[50,53,83-85]
the efficacy of  xxxd2792xxx  in obese patients with
hypercholesterolaemia compared with placebo has
been reviewed previously.[5] briefly, in randomised,
double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre trials,
 xxxd2792xxx  treatment in obese patients with hypercholesterolaemia generally resulted in significant
(p < 0.05) decreases in tc and ldl-c levels compared with patients receiving placebo.[5,77-79,84,85] in
obese patients without hypercholesterolaemia,  xxxd2792xxx  was associated with decreases from baseline in
mean tc and ldl-c levels that were generally
significantly (p < 0.01) different from placebo (table
iv).[13,17,54] a study of 106 asian patients showed no
differences in tc or ldl-c levels with  xxxd2792xxx 
treatment compared with placebo.[11]
in active-comparator studies,[61,65]  xxxd2792xxx  recipients had consistent decreases in tc and ldl-c
levels from baseline, although these decreases were
not always significantly different from the study
comparator. in one comparative study of  xxxd2792xxx  and
sibutramine,[61] obese patients receiving  xxxd2792xxx  had
a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in tc levels from
baseline that was not seen in sibutramine recipients.
 xxxd2792xxx  recipients again had a significant decrease
(p < 0.05 vs baseline) in ldl-c levels that was not
seen in sibutramine recipients in one study;[61] however, in another study,[65] recipients of both  xxxd2792xxx 
and sibutramine alone had significant (p < 0.05 and
0.002) decreases from baseline.[65] patients in this
study receiving sibutramine alone or a combination
of  xxxd2792xxx  and sibutramine also had decreases from
baseline in ldl-cholesterol that were significantly
greater than the decreases seen with  xxxd2792xxx  alone
(p ≤ 0.01).[65]
the two large post-marketing studies of  xxxd2792xxx ,
the xxl ( xxxd2792xxx  extralarge)[67] and x-pert[66]
trials, also showed improvement in tc and ldl-c
levels, irrespective of the magnitude of dietary restriction prescribed to patients (p < 0.0001 vs baseline).
the effect of  xxxd2792xxx  on mean hdl-c levels in
adult obese patients was variable in a number
of clinical trials (table iv),[11,13,54,61,65] although in
© 2006 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

1635

the two largest post-marketing studies of  xxxd2792xxx  (xpert[66] and xxl[67]), hdl-c levels were consistently increased from baseline after 7[67] and 12[66]
months of treatment (figure 3a). in other comparative trials in adults, mean hdl-c levels were not
different from their relevant comparator.[61,65]
effects on blood pressure (bp)

the effect of  xxxd2792xxx  on bp is shown in table
v.[11,13,54,61,65] compared with placebo, there were
significantly greater (p < 0.05) decreases in systolic
bp with  xxxd2792xxx  in two studies (0.5 vs 4.1mm hg[54]
and 3.4 vs 4.9mm hg [xendos].[17] significantly
greater decreases in diastolic bp were also seen in
the xendos study at 4 years (2.6 vs 1.9mm hg).[17]
significant decreases in systolic and diastolic bp
compared with baseline were seen in  xxxd2792xxx  recipients compared with sibutramine recipients in one
study;  xxxd2792xxx  recipients had a decrease in systolic
bp that was also significantly (p < 0.05) greater than
sibutramine recipients.[61]
in the large x-pert[66] and xxl[67] post-marketing studies, bp was consistently and significantly (p
< 0.01) decreased from baseline after 7[67] and 12[66]
months of treatment (figure 3b).
effects on progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus

 xxxd2792xxx  in combination with lifestyle changes
significantly delayed the progression to type 2 diabetes compared with placebo plus lifestyle changes
in the 4-year randomised, double-blind xendos
trial.[17,86] in the overall population (n = 3277) at

type 2 diabetes incidence rate after 4 years (p =

were reduced 36% with  xxxd2792xxx  use compared with
placebo in subgroup analyses (p = 0.03; poster
presentations).[87,88]
a similar incidence of type 2 diabetes was seen in
two studies of the effect of intensive lifestyle intervention on the progression to type 2 diabetes; the
diabetes prevention program study in 3234 patients
without a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes but with
elevated plasma glucose levels, who were randomised to receive placebo or metformin with moderate
lifestyle intervention, or intensive lifestyle intervention in order to achieve a weight loss of ≥7% of
baseline,[89] and the diabetes prevention study in
522 overweight patients with impaired glucose tolerance, who were randomised to receive general
dietary and exercise advice, or specific information
on how to achieve a weight loss of ≥5% with specific individualised programs.[90] the incidence of diabetes in both these studies was 58% lower in the
intervention group compared with the control
groups (both p < 0.001).[89,90] the cumulative incidence after 3[89] and 4[90] years was 14.4%[89] and
11%[90] in the intervention groups, and 28.9%[89] and
23%[90] in the control groups.

4.1.2 adolescents
effects on weight

two small, open-label, comparative pilot[19,74]
studies of obese adolescents have generally shown
that  xxxd2792xxx  is an effective treatment for overweight
or obese adolescents, with modest but statistically
significant weight loss achieved over 6 months to 1
year of treatment (table vi).[19,74] in a pilot study
investigating weight loss according to race, weight
reduction from baseline was 1.0kg for africanamerican adolescents and 6.4kg for caucasian adolescents receiving  xxxd2792xxx  (p < 0.05 vs baseline for
caucasian patients),[19] while  xxxd2792xxx  recipients in
another pilot study of  xxxd2792xxx  versus diet alone lost
6.3kg, compared with a weight gain in the diet alone
group of 4.2kg (p < 0.01 vs diet alone).[74]
two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in obese adolescents had variable
results (table vi).[15,16] in a large, placebo-controlled
study of 539 adolescents 12–16 years of age, the
 xxxd2792xxx  group showed a mean weight gain of 0.53kg
over 1 year, while the placebo group gained 3.14kg
(p ≤ 0.001 vs placebo).[15] another group of adolescents (n = 40, 14–18 years of age) showed no
additional weight loss with  xxxd2792xxx  compared with
placebo after 6 months of treatment.[16]

in terms of bmi, significant reductions (vs baseline, placebo or diet alone) were seen in all four

average change in bmi in the  xxxd2792xxx  group decreased by 0.55 (p ≤ 0.001 vs placebo), despite their
lack of weight loss.[15] more patients in the  xxxd2792xxx 
group of this study showed a ≥5% (26.5% vs 15.7%)

placebo: +0.002 vs –0.01 mmol/l[15] and –0.01 vs
+0.02 mmol/l[16]) levels were not significantly altered compared with baseline and placebo in both
studies.
in contrast to the results from the placebo-controlled trials, a small, open-label comparative pilot
study of 20 african-american and caucasian adolescents showed that  xxxd2792xxx  treatment for 6 months
produced significant decreases from baseline in tc
and ldl-c.[19] african-american adolescents had
decreases in tc and ldl-c of 0.39 mmol/l and
0.45 mmol/l (both p < 0.05), whereas caucasian
adolescents had decreases of 0.73 mmol/l (p <
0.001) and 0.5 mmol/l (p < 0.01).[19]
4.2 overweight/obese patients with the
metabolic syndrome

based on the national cholesterol education
program (ncep) adult treatment panel iii guidelines,[2] a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome is made
when at least three of the following criteria are
present: abdominal obesity with a waist circumference of >102cm in men and >88cm in women; a tg
level ≥1.7 mmol/l; an hdl-c level <1.0 mmol/l in
men and <1.3 mmol/l in women; bp ≥130/85mm
hg; and a fasting glucose level ≥110 mg/dl.
several studies have examined the efficacy of
 xxxd2792xxx  in patients with the metabolic syndrome
(usually diagnosed using the ncep criteria[58,63,73,91,92]). studies included overweight[63,73] or
obese[24,58,63,73,91,92] patients. some studies did not
include patients with concomitant type 2 diabetes[63,91,92] and in some studies, all patients had condrugs 2006; 66 (12)

comitant type 2 diabetes.[58,73] one study included
both patients with and without type 2 diabetes.[24]
this section will discuss the effect of  xxxd2792xxx  on
several endpoints (including bodyweight and lipid
levels), with a special focus on endpoints most relevant to the metabolic syndrome (tg and hdl-c
levels, bp and glycaemic control).
in prospective clinical trials investigating the efficacy of  xxxd2792xxx  in obese patients with the metabolic
syndrome, only one study had a clearly stated primary endpoint of change in metabolic syndrome parameters.[63]
4.2.1 effects on lipid levels
effects on triglyceride levels

 xxxd2792xxx  was generally associated with significant
reductions (vs placebo or baseline) in tg levels in
patients with the metabolic syndrome in randomised
studies (table vii).[24,58,63] subgroup analysis of metabolic syndrome patients in the xendos trial
showed no change in tg levels with  xxxd2792xxx  relative
to placebo after 4 years.[92] however, an additional
retrospective analysis of metabolic syndrome patients without type 2 diabetes participating in 20
randomised, double-blind trials showed similar results, although a subgroup analysis of responders
(≥5% weight loss in 3 months) did show a signifi© 2006 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

cant improvement in tg levels compared with placebo (poster presentation; p < 0.05).[93]
the change in tg levels was variable in other
comparative trials of  xxxd2792xxx  in metabolic syndrome
patients (table vii).[24,73] in one study of patients
with or without concomitant type 2 diabetes,[24]
there were generally significant (p ≤ 0.005) decreases in tg levels from baseline; in another study
of type 2 diabetic patients there was no significant
difference between  xxxd2792xxx  treatment and diet alone
(table vii).[73]
effects on high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol levels

results for hdl-c levels in  xxxd2792xxx  recipients
with the metabolic syndrome in comparative trials
were mixed (table vii).[24,58,63,73]  xxxd2792xxx  recipients
had significant increases in hdl-c versus placebo
(p < 0.001)[58] and baseline (p < 0.05)[24] in some
studies, and decreases versus baseline (p < 0.05) in
others;[63] one study showed no change in hdl-c
with  xxxd2792xxx  treatment or diet alone.[73]  xxxd2096xxx 
recipients in one study had significant increases in
hdl-c levels compared with  xxxd2792xxx  recipients (either alone or in combination with  xxxd2096xxx ; both p < 0.05) [table vii].[63] patients with
metabolic syndrome receiving  xxxd2792xxx  in the
xendos trial had a similar numerical change from

baseline as placebo recipients, according to a subgroup analysis (9.0% vs 9.4%).[92] retrospective
analysis of 20 randomised, double-blind studies
showed that hdl-c was increased from baseline,
but to a lesser extent than placebo (poster presentation; p < 0.05 in favour of placebo).[93]
effects on total cholesterol and low density
lipoprotein-cholesterol levels

comparative studies of  xxxd2792xxx  and  xxxd2096xxx 
showed that both drugs decreased levels of tc and
ldl-c from baseline.[63] patients receiving  xxxd2792xxx 
or  xxxd2096xxx  had significant decreases from baseline (p < 0.01) in both tc (1.2 and 1.1 mmol/l) and
ldl-c (0.7 and 0.4 mmol/l) levels.[63] a combination of  xxxd2792xxx  and  xxxd2096xxx  had additive effects,
with the magnitude of decrease in both tc (2.0
mmol/l) and ldl-c (1.3 mmol/l) levels at study
endpoint significantly (p < 0.01) greater in the combination group than in the groups taking  xxxd2792xxx  or
 xxxd2096xxx  alone.[63]
in patients with both the metabolic syndrome and
type 2 diabetes, treatment with  xxxd2792xxx  decreased
levels of both tc and ldl-c compared with placebo.[58]  xxxd2792xxx  recipients had decreases of 19.2% and

18.8% from baseline in tc and ldl-c after 6
months of treatment, compared with decreases of
1.8% and 5.0% in the placebo group (p ≤ 0.001).[58]
in other comparative trials, there was also an
improvement in lipid profile with  xxxd2792xxx  use, but
these changes were not always significantly different from comparator. a comparative trial of 40
obese patients with the metabolic syndrome (with or
without type 2 diabetes) showed that both groups
had statistically significant reductions in tc (p <
0.001) and ldl-c (p < 0.01) levels from baseline,
irrespective of their glycaemic status.[24] compared
with a hypocaloric diet alone, patients with the
metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes in another
study who received  xxxd2792xxx  in combination with a
hypocaloric diet had small, but statistically significant (p ≤ 0.003), reductions in tc (0.6 mmol/l) and
ldl-c (0.5 mmol/l) levels after 6 months of treatment.[73]
4.2.2 effects on bp

bp was significantly reduced with  xxxd2792xxx  in all
comparative trials in obese adult patients with the
metabolic syndrome.[58,63,73]  xxxd2792xxx  was associated
with significant reductions in bp versus basedrugs 2006; 66 (12)

line[63,73] or placebo,[58] with no significant difference versus  xxxd2096xxx [63] (table viii). systolic bp
was also reduced significantly in  xxxd2792xxx  recipients
compared with diet alone (p < 0.05).[73] in a subgroup analysis of patients with metabolic syndrome
in the xendos trial, reductions in bp in recipients
of  xxxd2792xxx  were significantly greater than with placebo (p < 0.03).[92] an additional retrospective analysis of 20 randomised, double-blind studies showed
that  xxxd2792xxx  treatment improved both systolic and
diastolic bp significantly compared with placebo in
patients with the metabolic syndrome (poster presentation; p < 0.05).[93]
4.2.3 effects on glycaemic control

patients with the metabolic syndrome with or
without type 2 diabetes receiving  xxxd2792xxx  had significant decreases in fasting plasma glucose (fpg)
levels compared with either baseline,  xxxd2096xxx  or
placebo (table viii). in patients without type 2 diabetes, decreases in fpg in  xxxd2792xxx  recipients ranged
from 7 to 86.5 mg/dl (p < 0.05 vs baseline);[24,63]
patients receiving  xxxd2792xxx , alone or in combination
with  xxxd2096xxx , also had significant decreases in
fpg compared with recipients of  xxxd2096xxx  alone

(p < 0.05).[63] glycaemic control as measured by
fpg was also significantly improved compared with
placebo (p < 0.05) in a retrospective analysis of 20
randomised, double-blind studies in patients with
the metabolic syndrome but without type 2 diabetes
(poster presentation).[93] in patients with type 2 diabetes taking  xxxd2792xxx , decreases from baseline in fpg
levels of 28.8–45.0 mg/dl were achieved after 3–6
months (table viii),[24,58,73] a significant decrease
compared with baseline, placebo or diet alone (table
viii).
4.2.4 effects on weight

 xxxd2792xxx  was significantly more effective than placebo or  xxxd2096xxx  in reducing weight and bmi in
obese patients without type 2 diabetes and with
diagnosed metabolic syndrome.[63,91,92] subgroup
analysis of the xendos trial presented in abstracts[91,92] showed that the 40% of patients diagnosed with metabolic syndrome in the study[91] had
significantly greater weight losses with  xxxd2792xxx  compared with placebo (6.3 vs 3.0kg; p < 0.001).[92] in a
comparative study of  xxxd2792xxx  and  xxxd2096xxx  in 86
obese patients without diabetes (fenorli study,

 xxxd2096xxx  recipients. the reductions in  xxxd2792xxx  recipients were also significant versus baseline (p <
0.05).[63] it is notable that after 3 months’ treatment
with  xxxd2792xxx ,  xxxd2096xxx  or a combination of the
two, 43.5%, 47.6% and 50% of patients no longer
met the diagnostic criteria for the metabolic syndrome.[63] similar results were seen in retrospective
analyses ( xxxd2792xxx  vs placebo, 45% vs 39%; p < 0.05)
[poster presentation].[93]
 xxxd2792xxx  also produced a loss in weight in obese
patients with the metabolic syndrome in other comparative studies.[24] subgroup analysis revealed that
20 patients without diabetes who received  xxxd2792xxx 
for 3 months had a mean weight loss of 5.6–7.9kg,
while 20 patients with type 2 diabetes in the same
study had similar losses (p < 0.01 vs baseline for
both).[24]
 xxxd2792xxx  was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing weight and bmi in obese patients
with type 2 diabetes and diagnosed metabolic syndrome.[58] a study of 90 patients who received  xxxd2792xxx  or placebo for three months showed that  xxxd2792xxx 
recipients had statistically significantly greater (p <
0.02) decreases in both weight (5.6 vs 2.6kg) and
bmi (3.3 vs 1.9 kg/m2) compared with placebo
recipients.[58]
 xxxd2792xxx  also produced a modest loss in weight in
patients with the metabolic syndrome and with or
without concomitant type 2 diabetes in other comparative studies.[24,73] in a comparative study of the
effect of  xxxd2792xxx  in patients with the metabolic syndrome with or without type 2 diabetes, 20 patients
with type 2 diabetes had losses of 5.7–8.5kg after 6
months of treatment; patients without diabetes had
similar losses (p < 0.01 vs baseline for both).[24] in
another study in 126 obese patients, all with type 2
diabetes,  xxxd2792xxx  recipients (n = 94) had significant
weight loss from baseline (93.4–87.8kg; p <
0.0001), whereas patients on a hypocaloric diet
alone did not.[73] of note, weight loss experienced
by patients receiving  xxxd2792xxx  in this study was
marked enough to enable a significant number of
patients (p < 0.0001 vs diet alone) to no longer meet

the criteria for the metabolic syndrome (35% vs 9%
for  xxxd2792xxx  plus diet vs diet alone).[73]
4.3 obese patients with type 2
diabetes mellitus

this section concentrates on the efficacy of  xxxd2792xxx  in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. studies in
patients with concomitant metabolic syndrome are
discussed in section 4.2.
several large (n >150) randomised, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, multicentre trials have investigated the efficacy of  xxxd2792xxx  in overweight or obese
patients with type 2 diabetes over a period of 24–52
weeks (table ix).[56,57,77,80,81,83,94,95]
4.3.1 effects on weight

 xxxd2792xxx  was significantly more effective than placebo in producing a modest weight loss (table ix).
 xxxd2792xxx  recipients had a mean weight loss of
3.9–6.2kg, a significantly (p < 0.005) greater weight
loss than placebo recipients, who lost an average of
1.3–4.3kg (table ix).[56,57,77,80,81,83,94,95] mean percentage weight loss was 3.8–6.8% of initial
bodyweight in  xxxd2792xxx  recipients, while patients taking placebo lost 1.3–4.3% (table ix; p < 0.01 vs
placebo).[56,57,77,80,81,83,94,95]
in addition, compared with placebo, significantly
greater proportions of patients taking  xxxd2792xxx  lost
≥5% (p < 0.01)[56,57,77,80,81,83,94,95] or ≥10% (p <
0.05)[56,57,80,81,83] of their original bodyweight (table
ix).
 xxxd2792xxx  and sibutramine showed similar efficacy
in a single well designed 52-week trial (table ix).[64]
4.3.2 effects on glycaemic control
glycosylated haemoglobin

 xxxd2792xxx  was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing mean hba1c levels in obese patients with type 2 diabetes (table ix).[56,57,77,80,83,94]
patients receiving  xxxd2792xxx  had reductions in hba1c
levels ranging from 0.3% to 1.1%, while patients
receiving placebo had changes ranging from –0.6%
to +0.2% (table ix). mean hba1c levels decreased
significantly (p < 0.01) from baseline in patients
taking  xxxd2792xxx  or sibutramine for 12 months, but
there was no between-group difference (0.8% vs

glucose

the effect of  xxxd2792xxx  on fpg levels was variable,
despite consistent decreases from baseline.[56,57,64]
fpg levels were significantly decreased in  xxxd2792xxx 
recipients compared with placebo in two studies
(23.4 vs 9 mg/dl [p < 0.001][56] and 11.0 vs 3.0%
[p < 0.0001][57]).  xxxd2792xxx  and sibutramine showed
similar efficacy in terms of reducing fpg levels

two treatment groups.[64]
post-prandial glucose levels decreased significantly relative to placebo in all patients receiving
 xxxd2792xxx  in two studies in patients with type 2 diabetes.[56,57] post-prandial glucose at 2 hours had decreased by 4.1 mmol/l in  xxxd2792xxx  recipients at study
end in one study (vs 1.5 mmol/l in placebo recipients; p < 0.0001),[56] and by 11% in another study
(vs +1.5% in placebo recipients; p = 0.002).[57] similar results were seen in active comparator studies,

from baseline with  xxxd2792xxx  treatment, but not relative
to sibutramine (9.9% vs 10.3%; p < 0.02 vs baseline).[64]
effects on glycaemic status

glycaemic status was improved in patients with
type 2 diabetes receiving  xxxd2792xxx , and this allowed
some patients to decrease their dosage of antidiabetic medication and, in some cases, discontinue antidiabetic treatment.[56,57,80,81] in two placebo-controlled
trials, more  xxxd2792xxx  recipients had a decrease in the
dosage or discontinued their antidiabetic medication
compared with placebo (41.3% vs 30.9%[80] and
17.1% vs 8.2%[81]). after 24 weeks of treatment,
44.3% of 125 chinese patients on  xxxd2792xxx  had their
glycaemic status reclassified from type 2 diabetes to
either impaired glucose tolerance or normal glucose
tolerance.[56] in a group of 120 patients taking either
metformin alone or metformin plus a sulfonylurea,
6.3% and 9.9% of  xxxd2792xxx  recipients had a decrease
in their medication dosage, compared with 0.9% and
3.7% of patients in the placebo group (p-values not
reported).[57]
4.3.3 effects on lipid levels

the effect of  xxxd2792xxx  on tc levels was consistently favourable compared with placebo in obese patients with type 2 diabetes, although ldl-c levels
were more variable (table x).[56,57] in chinese patients, 6 months of  xxxd2792xxx  treatment resulted in
statistically significant reductions in tc (betweengroup difference –7.7 mmol/l; p = 0.0002 vs placebo);[56] similarly, a swedish study showed that 1
year of  xxxd2792xxx  treatment produced significant improvements in tc levels compared with placebo

(–0.24 vs +0.1 mmol/l; p < 0.03).[57] ldl-c was
significantly changed in  xxxd2792xxx  recipients in the
chinese study compared with placebo (betweengroup difference –9.5 mmol/l; p = 0.0085 vs placebo),[56] whereas ldl-c levels in the swedish study
were unchanged (–0.08 vs +0.01 mmol/l).[57]
mean levels of hdl-c were generally not significantly altered in patients receiving  xxxd2792xxx  compared with placebo recipients in obese patients with
type 2 diabetes (table x).[56,57] in one study only
were the changes from baseline significantly different in  xxxd2792xxx  recipients compared with placebo
(–0.01 vs +0.07 mmol/l; p ≤ 0.002).[57]
tg levels were not significantly altered in patients treated with  xxxd2792xxx  compared with placebo in
patients with type 2 diabetes, either between groups
or from baseline (table x).[56,57]
4.3.4 effects on bp

bp was generally unchanged in obese  xxxd2792xxx 
recipients with type 2 diabetes compared with baseline or comparator (table xi).[56,57,64] significant (p <
0.05) changes in systolic and diastolic bp compared
with baseline were seen in  xxxd2792xxx  recipients in one
comparative study of  xxxd2792xxx  and sibutramine;[64] bp
in sibutramine recipients remained unchanged compared with baseline.

effects on weight

weight loss (the primary endpoint in both studies) in patients with binge eating disorder was accelerated with  xxxd2792xxx  compared with placebo in two
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of 50[59] and 89[13] patients. in the larger multicentre study, weight loss was more than three times
greater in patients taking  xxxd2792xxx  for 6 months than
in recipients of placebo (7.4% vs 2.3% of initial
bodyweight).[13] after 12 weeks of treatment, 32%
of patients taking  xxxd2792xxx  in the smaller study had
achieved a weight loss ≥5% of their baseline
weight,[59] compared with 8% of the placebo group
(p < 0.05).[59] the weight loss achieved during the
treatment period was maintained after discontinuation of treatment, with 42% of  xxxd2792xxx  recipients
versus 10% of placebo recipients sustaining a 5%
baseline weight loss 3 months after cessation of
treatment.[59]
effects on lipid levels

obese  xxxd2792xxx  recipients with binge eating disorder had an improvement in tc levels from baseline
after treatment compared with placebo recipients,
but their ldl-c, hdl-c and tg levels were unchanged (table iv).[13] from the lead-in period, tc
levels had decreased 0.1 mmol/l and 0.5 mmol/l in
the placebo and  xxxd2792xxx  groups at study end (p =
0.029 vs placebo).[13]

remission of binge eating

 xxxd2792xxx  was significantly more effective than placebo in achieving a remission of binge eating symptoms in the smaller study.[59] indeed, binge eating
remission after 12 weeks of treatment was evident in
64% of  xxxd2792xxx  recipients, and 36% of placebo recipients (p < 0.05). at 12-week follow-up after cessation of treatment, binge eating remission rates were
52% for both groups.[59] in the larger study, binge
eating remission rates were 77% and 71% for  xxxd2792xxx  and placebo recipients at study end.[13]  xxxd2792xxx 
was not associated with significant changes in psychological state or attitude at study end in either
study.[13,59]
4.4.2 other conditions

with the exception of a randomised, placebocontrolled trial in 44 patients with nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease,[60] the studies presented in this section
are pilot studies of <25 obese patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis,[68] heart failure,[75] depression[71] and post-menopausal symptoms.[72] the
heart failure study[75] included a standard care only
group, while the other pilot studies were noncomparative.
effects on weight

the effect of  xxxd2792xxx  on weight loss was inconsistent across randomised comparative trials in different patient populations. in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, there was significant weight
loss and decrease in bmi in patients treated with
 xxxd2792xxx  or placebo compared with baseline (p <
0.01), with no significant between-group difference
drugs 2006; 66 (12)

 xxxd2792xxx : a review

(7.7 vs 5.9kg).[60] patients with heart failure receiving concomitant standard care also showed significant decreases in weight (–4.65 vs +4.39kg; p <
0.05) and bmi (–1.66 vs +1.45 kg/m2; p < 0.05)
compared with standard care alone.[75] mean weight
or bmi decreased significantly (p < 0.01) from
baseline in noncomparative studies of  xxxd2792xxx  in
patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis,[68] in a
group of post-menopausal women[72] and in patients
with depression.[71]
other endpoints

 xxxd2792xxx  treatment also improved markers of liver
damage in patients with liver disease.  xxxd2792xxx  recipients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis showed significant reductions from baseline in both alt and
ast levels (p < 0.01).[68] the reduction from baseline in serum alt levels was also numerically
greater in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease taking  xxxd2792xxx  versus placebo;[60] gamma-glutamyl
transferase levels were also significantly (p < 0.05)
reduced from baseline in the  xxxd2792xxx  group only.[60]
a complete reversal of symptoms of fatty liver
disease was seen in a higher number of  xxxd2792xxx  than
placebo recipients (p < 0.05).[60]
statistically significant improvements in new
york heart association functional class and 6-minute walk test were seen in patients with heart failure
taking  xxxd2792xxx  compared with standard care alone
(p < 0.05).[75]
5. pharmacoeconomic analyses
several well designed pharmacoeconomic studies investigating the cost effectiveness of  xxxd2792xxx  in
obese adult patients with or without type 2 diabetes
have been performed. the studies included in table
xii are all fully published, and clearly state the
study purpose and perspective and the year of costing. sensitivity analysis was performed in all studies, with the results clearly presented and study
limitations discussed. the perspectives were those
of the healthcare system,[96-98,101,103] healthcare insurer[100] and patient.[99,102] all but one[101] of the
studies based their calculations on the results obtained in randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre clinical trials, with an  xxxd2792xxx  treatment period of

1[96-100] or 2[101,102] years and an assumed weight and/
or hba1c regain period of 3[96,97,99,100] or 5[98,102]
years after cessation of treatment. a second course
of  xxxd2792xxx  treatment was not modelled in any of the
studies, nor were gender effects taken into account.[96-102]
5.1 obese patients without type 2 diabetes

 xxxd2792xxx  was a cost effective treatment for obese
adult patients in several pharmacoeconomic analyses. studies in the uk,[101] sweden[96] and ireland[97]
utilising cost-utility and decision-tree models to investigate the cost effectiveness of  xxxd2792xxx  in obese
patients without type 2 diabetes who responded to
 xxxd2792xxx  treatment (>5% weight loss after 3 months)
found that the cost per quality-adjusted life year
(qaly) gained ranged from £19 005 to £24 431 for
a theoretical cohort of 100 people,[101] and from
€13 125[96] to €16 954[97] (table xii).
sensitivity analysis showed that all pharmacoeconomic analyses were robust, although there
were several limitations. many of these related to
assumptions made in relation to the clinical trial data
used in the models: the type of data available; the
assumptions made regarding trial outcomes; translating data from other countries to the country of
analysis; and the assumption of a relationship between weight loss and eventual morbidity and mortality. other limitations related to the modelling
process, and include possible overestimation of utilities, using a simple model of diabetes incidence,
assuming nonresponders received no benefits at all,
not calculating costs related to comorbidities, and
using a limited perspective.[96,97,101]
5.2 obese patients with type 2 diabetes

the cost effectiveness of  xxxd2792xxx  in the treatment
of obese patients with type 2 diabetes has also been
shown in several studies, which used 10-[102] or 11year[98-100] markov models (table xii). two studies
considered a subgroup of patients responding to
treatment (≥3% weight loss after 3 months),[99,100]
whereas two studies did not.[98,102] the studies calculated costs relevant to belgium,[102] the us,[98] switzerland[99,100] and sweden,[100] and showed that the

 xxxd2792xxx : a review

costs per qaly gained for patients with type 2
diabetes with no additional diabetes-related complications were €13 600–19 986,[99,102] $us8327,[98]
and chf22 061.[100] costs per qaly gained for
patients with complications (hypercholesterolaemia
and/or hypertension) ranged from €3462–7407[102]
(table xii). sensitivity analysis revealed the results
of all the studies[98-100] to be robust, with the exception of one study;[102] the sensitivity analysis in this
study showed that the conclusion of cost effectiveness of  xxxd2792xxx  was not robust in patients with type 2
diabetes without further complications.
there were several limitations associated with
these analyses. again, the limitations related to the
clinical trial data used as sources of clinical information, and the assumptions made in the models. limitations related to trial data include the type of
clinical data available, the applicability of data to the
country of analysis, and to the wider population,
given that data from the uk prospective diabetes
study (ukpds 35)[108] used to estimate risks and
events is only applicable to male patients with a
mean age of 52 years.[98,99] limitations of the models used were using a model that precluded a sensitivity analysis in patients with a clustering of risk
factors,[99] and not determining utilities for patients
specific to the country of analysis.[100]
6. tolerability
the tolerability profile of  xxxd2792xxx  has been reviewed in detail previously;[5-7] therefore, this section will provide a brief overview of the key tolerability data related to administration of the approved
dosage of  xxxd2792xxx  (i.e. 120mg three times daily).
 xxxd2792xxx  was generally well tolerated, with adverse events being transient and mild to moderate in
severity; adverse events generally resolved without
intervention within the first few weeks of treatment.[8,17,56-59,61,63,70,73] of the serious adverse events
reported, only cholelithiasis (0.3%[15] and 0.5%[66]),
abdominal pain (0.5%[66]), chest pain (0.5%[66]),
pancreatitis (0.5%[66]) and anal fissure (0.5%[66])
were considered related to treatment.

 xxxd2792xxx : a review

other placebo-controlled trials include oily spotting,
flatus with discharge, faecal urgency, fatty/oily
stool, oily evacuation, increased defecation and faecal incontinence (figure 4a).[8,15] additional adverse
events in adolescent patients included abdominal
pain (22%), soft stool (15%), nausea (15%) and
flatulence (9%; figure 4b).[15] in adult patients receiving  xxxd2792xxx , other adverse events (occurring at a
frequency of ≥5% in  xxxd2792xxx  or placebo recipients)
included abdominal and rectal pain (26% and 5%),
nausea (8%), diarrhoea (5%), influenza (40%), upper and lower respiratory tract infection (38% and
8%), urinary tract infection (8%), back pain (14%),
arthritis (5%), headache (31%), fatigue (7%), dizziness (5%) and menstrual irregularity (10%).[8] in
primary care settings (xxl and x-pert trials),
gastrointestinal adverse events (including nausea)
were the most frequent,[66,67] with headache,[66,67]
and nasopharyngitis[66] being the most frequent nongastrointestinal events reported.
obese patients with type 2 diabetes and/or the
metabolic syndrome who received  xxxd2792xxx  had similar adverse event profiles to obese patients without
these diseases in comparative trials.[56-58,63,73] gastrointestinal events of mild to moderate severity
were the most commonly reported adverse events in
 xxxd2792xxx  recipients,[56-58,63,73] and where non-gastrointestinal adverse effects were reported, they were
either more frequent in the placebo group[57] or were
not considered related to the study drug.[56] where
stated, the frequency of adverse events generally
decreased with continuing treatment.[58,63,73]

amended with a warning regarding reduced bioavailability of oral contraceptives in women receiving
 xxxd2792xxx  who experience severe diarrhoea.[9]
7. dosage and administration
 xxxd2792xxx  is indicated for use in weight management in obese adult patients with a bmi of ≥30 kg/
m2,[8,9] or in overweight patients (bmi ≥27 kg/m2[8]
or ≥28 kg/m2[9]) with additional risk factors.[8,9]  xxxd2792xxx  is also approved in the us for use in obese
adolescents aged 12–16 years,[8] and clinical, safety
and efficacy data for obese adolescents have recently been included in the european label.[9,109]
the recommended dosage of  xxxd2792xxx  is 120mg
three times daily. the drug should be taken immediately before, during, or within 1 hour of a main
meal.[8,9] the exception to this is when a meal is
missed or contains no fat, in which case the  xxxd2792xxx 
dose can be omitted.[8,9] the european label states
that  xxxd2792xxx  treatment be discontinued if patients
have not lost ≥5% of their initial bodyweight after
12 weeks of therapy;[9] the us label contains no such
restriction.[8] the us fda has recently recommended the approval of an over-the-counter formulation
of  xxxd2792xxx  (60mg capsules) to facilitate weight reduction in overweight adults.[110]

reported adverse events in comparative trials of
 xxxd2792xxx  and sibutramine in obese patients with or
without type 2 diabetes differed between the two
drugs.[61,62,64] while adverse events in  xxxd2792xxx 
recipients were generally gastrointestinal, sibutramine recipients reported constipation,[61,62,64]
headache,[61,62,64]
insomnia,[61,64]
hypermenor[62]
[61,62,64]
rhoea, dry mouth
and increased bp.[61,64]

patients receiving  xxxd2792xxx  should be on a balanced, mildly hypocaloric diet rich in fruit and vegetables, with approximately 30% of daily caloric
intake from fat. the possibility of gastrointestinal
adverse events increases with consumption of a high
fat meal; therefore, the daily intake of fats, carbohydrate and protein should be distributed over three
main meals.[8,9] since  xxxd2792xxx  may inhibit the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (section 2), patients
are advised to supplement their diet with a multivitamin, taken at least 2 hours before or after  xxxd2792xxx 
administration. [8,9]

although clinical studies have shown no
pharmacokinetic interaction between  xxxd2792xxx  and
oral contraceptives (section 3), the summary of
product characteristics for  xxxd2792xxx  has recently been

local prescribing information should be consulted for additional information on other precautions, drug interactions and contraindications associated with  xxxd2792xxx  use.

8. place of  xxxd2792xxx  in the management
of patients with obesity
a sedentary lifestyle coupled with an increased
intake of energy-dense foods is contributing to the
increasing prevalence of global obesity, defined as a
bmi of >30 kg/m2.[3,111] at least 300 million adults
are considered clinically obese worldwide, a subset
of the 1 billion adults considered overweight (bmi
>25 kg/m2); 22 million children under 5 years of age
are also considered overweight.[111] obesity increases both all-cause mortality and the risk of morbidity from cardiovascular disease, dyslipidaemia,
hypertension, stroke, osteoarthritis, sleep apnoea,
respiratory problems, type 2 diabetes and several
types of cancer.[1,3,4] conservative estimates of the
contribution of obesity to the cost of healthcare in
several developed countries are 2–6% of total
costs.[111]
a weight loss of 5–10% of initial bodyweight has
been shown to improve cardiovascular risk factors.
a reduction in blood glucose and hba1c levels, and
a reduced progression from impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes is also seen with weight loss
of that magnitude.[1,3] a range of strategies can be
employed to achieve weight loss, and include lifestyle interventions (diet and exercise), behavioural
therapy, pharmacotherapy and surgery.[3] pharmacotherapy is recommended for obese patients in
whom lifestyle interventions have failed, while surgery is considered an option for patients with obesity-related comorbidities whose bmi is >40 kg/m2
and in whom lifestyle interventions (with or without
pharmacotherapy) have failed to induce weight
loss.[112]
a number of pharmacological agents have been
used to facilitate weight loss, including  xxxd2792xxx ,
noradrenergic drugs, fenfluramines, aminorex and
sibutramine.[3] however, some of these agents (e.g.
fenfluramines) are not well tolerated and have been
withdrawn from the market due to adverse effects.
until recently,  xxxd2792xxx  and sibutramine were the
only weight-loss drugs approved for long-term therapy;[3] however, the cannabinoid receptor antagonist
rimonabant is now also approved for long-term
use.[113] sibutramine is a centrally-acting reuptake

henness & perry

inhibitor of serotonin and noradrenaline (norepinephrine), that reduces weight by enhancing satiety and thermogenesis.[114] it has been associated with
increases in bp and heart rate in some obese patients; these adverse events require monitoring, particularly in obese patients with hypertension.[114]
sibutramine should not be used in patients with
poorly controlled or uncontrolled hypertension, arrhythmias or heart disease.[4,114]
 xxxd2792xxx  is a reversible inhibitor of gastric and
pancreatic lipases that acts in the lumen of the
stomach and small intestine, preventing lipases from
hydrolysing tgs from dietary fat.[5-9] undigested
tgs are excreted in the faeces; the inhibition of
dietary fat absorption results in a caloric deficit
(section 2). the efficacy of  xxxd2792xxx  in modest weight
loss and in slowing weight regain compared with
placebo has long been demonstrated in well designed clinical trials. in large (n > 400) placebocontrolled and post-marketing studies, weight loss
with  xxxd2792xxx  treatment has been demonstrated to
occur quickly, with over half of the total mean
weight loss achieved at 1 year occurring during the
first 3 months of treatment. the comparative trials
of  xxxd2792xxx  and sibutramine reviewed in sections 4.1,
4.2 and 4.3 are comparatively small (n <150) relative to some of the large (n ≥350) placebo-controlled
trials of  xxxd2792xxx  included in this review. in studies of
the efficacy of  xxxd2792xxx  and sibutramine, obese patients with or without type 2 diabetes taking either
drug lost weight relative to baseline; generally there
was no between-group difference, although in some
studies that included a combination therapy group,
weight loss with sibutramine with or without  xxxd2792xxx 
was significantly increased compared with  xxxd2792xxx 
alone.[62,65] in patients with type 2 diabetes, both
 xxxd2792xxx  and sibutramine produced reductions in
hba1c and fpg levels with no difference between
groups. with regard to cardiovascular risk factors,
both  xxxd2792xxx  and sibutramine showed efficacy in
reducing lipid levels significantly from baseline
(section 4), with generally no between-group difference.  xxxd2792xxx  decreased bp significantly from baseline compared with sibutramine, reflecting the adverse-event profile typically seen with sibutramine.
drugs 2006; 66 (12)

 xxxd2792xxx : a review

more recently, the results of large post-marketing
trials have shown that  xxxd2792xxx  is also a beneficial
treatment for obese patients in situations that are
more akin to everyday life compared with a clinical
trial setting, in relation to weight loss, and changes
in bp and lipid profile (section 4.1.1). in addition,
the efficacy of  xxxd2792xxx  in producing weight loss has
now been demonstrated in clinical trials encompassing a more diverse group of obese patients, including adult patients with the metabolic syndrome and/
or type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes. patients with
binge eating disorder, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, post-menopause, depression or heart failure
have also been shown to receive modest benefits
from treatment with  xxxd2792xxx  (section 4.4). of note,
 xxxd2792xxx  has also been shown to be effective (section
4.1.2) and well tolerated in facilitating weight and
bmi decreases in obese adolescents. the management of obesity in this age group is notoriously
difficult, due to the lack of treatment programmes
specifically tailored for children and adolescents,
and the fact that following a sustained diet and
exercise programme is difficult for most children.[15,16,74] since the prevalence of obesity is increasing in this age group, the results obtained with
 xxxd2792xxx  are encouraging, and present a potentially
promising treatment modality, in conjunction with
lifestyle changes, for obese adolescents in the future.
since weight loss is often difficult to maintain in
the long term for many obese patients,[114] a well
tolerated pharmacotherapy regimen that allows patients to maintain weight lost is an important facet of
the long-term management of obesity. in addition to
its role in the management of weight loss,  xxxd2792xxx 
has also been shown to have efficacy in slowing
weight regain in obese patients no longer following
a hypocaloric diet. in studies where patients followed a hypocaloric diet for the first year and then
switched to a eucaloric diet in the second year,
weight regain was slowed with  xxxd2792xxx  treatment,
with those patients receiving  xxxd2792xxx  in combination
with a eucaloric diet regaining approximately half as
much weight as patients receiving placebo with the
same diet (section 4.1.1).[50,53]

over 80% of patients with type 2 diabetes are
overweight or obese, with a high percentage of
abdominal visceral fat that confounds successful
long-term management of the disease.[115]  xxxd2792xxx 
had efficacy in reducing weight in obese patients
with type 2 diabetes, irrespective of whether patients
were taking antidiabetic medication, in well designed trials (section 4.3).  xxxd2792xxx  treatment also
resulted in clinically small, but statistically significant, improvements in hba1c, fpg and post-prandial glucose levels (relative to placebo or baseline),
that allowed a substantial number of patients to
reduce their dosage of antidiabetic medication or
stop it completely. moreover, some patients had
their diabetes status re-classified as either impaired
or normal glucose tolerance (section 4.3). in addition, the 4-year xendos trial showed that  xxxd2792xxx 
plus diet also significantly reduced the incidence of
type 2 diabetes and the progression to type 2 diabetes in patients with impaired glucose tolerance compared with placebo plus diet; the decreased incidence of type 2 diabetes in the xendos trial was
similar to that seen in intervention studies in patients
undergoing intensive diet and exercise counselling.
the metabolic syndrome is known to increase
cardiovascular disease risk and the progression to
type 2 diabetes.  xxxd2792xxx  was generally effective in
reducing some features of the metabolic syndrome
in patients diagnosed with the syndrome (section
4.2). in patients with metabolic syndrome receiving
 xxxd2792xxx , tg levels, bp and glycaemic control were
consistently improved, and, in some studies, the
improvement in metabolic parameters was such that
a significant number of patients, relative to placebo
or diet alone, no longer met the criteria for metabolic
syndrome (section 4.2.4).
in patients without diagnosed metabolic syndrome, results were more variable.  xxxd2792xxx  was effective in reducing cardiovascular and metabolic
risk factors, but additional large, well controlled
prospective studies into the efficacy of  xxxd2792xxx  in
reducing these risk factors and subsequent progression to the metabolic syndrome in well defined
patient groups may serve to delineate more clearly
drugs 2006; 66 (12)

1652

the role of  xxxd2792xxx  in improving these metabolic
parameters.
in addition to facilitating weight loss and improving the diagnostic and clinical features of type 2
diabetes and the metabolic syndrome,  xxxd2792xxx  has
also shown efficacy in reducing other disease parameters.  xxxd2792xxx  treatment improved markers of
cardiovascular disease and heart function parameters (functional class and 6–minute walk test) in
patients with heart failure. factors involved or implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, such as myocardial performance index, plasminogen activator inhibitor activity, and levels of
malondialdehyde, il-6 and  xxxg520xxx  were
also improved (section 2); these parameters are also
relevant to the metabolic syndrome, since it is
characterised by a prothrombotic and proinflammatory state.[2] markers of liver disease in patients
with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease were also reduced in recipients of
 xxxd2792xxx  (section 4.4.2). in addition, improved enzyme markers of liver damage and a complete reversal of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease occurred in a
larger proportion of recipients of  xxxd2792xxx  than placebo. patients with binge eating disorder (section
4.4.1) had symptoms of binge eating recede after
 xxxd2792xxx  treatment.
few interactions between  xxxd2792xxx  and co-administered drugs have been reported; the only significant interactions are with ciclosporin or amiodarone
(section 3).
 xxxd2792xxx  is generally well tolerated. its tolerability
profile is characterised by gastrointestinal tract
symptoms (section 6). adverse effects experienced
by  xxxd2792xxx  recipients were generally mild and transient, with most resolving within a few weeks of
treatment; some researchers suggest that this is due
to an ongoing learning process obese patients experience when first learning to decrease fat in their
diet.[58] despite the potential for the absorption of
fat-soluble vitamins to be decreased because of decreased fat absorption with  xxxd2792xxx  use, levels of fat
soluble vitamins were not consistently decreased in
 xxxd2792xxx  recipients (section 2.2). nevertheless, multi© 2006 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

henness & perry

vitamin supplementation is recommended for patients taking  xxxd2792xxx .
given the burden of obesity and its comorbidities
on the healthcare system, it follows that
pharmacotherapy that reduces morbidity and mortality from obesity-related complications may provide economic as well as health benefits. several
well designed, fully published pharmacoeconomic
analyses of  xxxd2792xxx  have shown that  xxxd2792xxx  is a costeffective treatment option for obese patients with or
without type 2 diabetes (section 5).
in conclusion, in conjunction with a hypocaloric
diet and moderate exercise,  xxxd2792xxx  is an effective
drug for use in the management of obesity in adults
with or without comorbidities. recent data have
shown that  xxxd2792xxx  is also effective as a component
of weight management strategies in obese adolescents. in addition to its well established efficacy in
achieving modest weight loss,  xxxd2792xxx  has been
shown to improve glycaemic parameters in obese
adults with type 2 diabetes, as well as some features
of the metabolic syndrome.  xxxd2792xxx  is generally well
tolerated. thus,  xxxd2792xxx  is an option for the treatment
of obese patients with or without type 2 diabetes and
also has a role in the management of obese patients
with the metabolic syndrome, associated comorbidities or concomitant disorders.
