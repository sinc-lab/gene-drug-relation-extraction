-cell-mediated acute graft rejection, major
problem in renal transplantation, represents an important risk factor for chronic graft dysfunction and graft
loss.1  xxxg1173xxx  ( xxxg1173xxx ), the principle cytokine involved,
needs to bind to  xxxg1173xxx  receptors on activated t cells
to facilitate t-cell proliferation and cytotoxic t-cell generation.2  xxxd286xxx , a chimeric monoclonal antibody that
specifically binds to the ␣ subunit of the interleukin-2
receptor ( xxxg1174xxx ␣), blocks the binding of  xxxg1173xxx , resulting in
inhibition of ongoing immune responses.3 since  xxxg1174xxx ␣ is
only expressed on the activated t lymphocytes, theoretically
its immunosuppressive effect is selective and will not increase the incidence of infection or malignancy.4 the
current study evaluated the clinical efficacy of  xxxd286xxx 
plus cyclosporine-based immunosuppressive therapy in oriental patients.
we retrospectively compared the first-year clinical outcome of renal transplant recipients who had received
 xxxd286xxx  in the dose of 20 mg at the time of surgery and
at day 4 posttransplant plus cyclosporine, prednisolone, and
azathioprine (gp i) with those who received tacrolimus,
prednisolone, and azathioprine (gp ii) during the same
period of follow-up in our center. the cyclosporine trough
level was maintained at 250 to 300 ␮g/l for the first 3
months posttransplantation and then 150 to 250 ␮g/l. the
tarcolimus level was maintained  xxxd1891xxx  to 20 ng/ml for the
first 3 months and then 5 to 15 ng/ml afterward. azathioprine was omitted if the patients were seropositive for
hepatitis b or c.
there were altogether 18 patients, nine in each group.
gp i patients showed a mean age similar as gp ii subjects,
namely 36.9 ⫾ 2.2 versus 38.8 ⫾ 1.6 years, respectively. the
sex ratio, duration of pretransplant dialysis (80.1 ⫾ 21.8
versus 88.6 ⫾ 21.5 months), donor source (cadaveric/live:
5/4 versus 6/3), mean number of hla mismatches (2.9
versus 2.7), and hepatitis status were comparable between
the groups. four patients in gp i experienced delayed graft
function of a mean duration of 8.3 ⫾ 2.3 days, while one
patient in gp ii had delayed graft function of 15 days. the
baseline renal function at 1 month posttransplant were
similar with mean serum creatinine values of 147.4 ⫾ 18
versus 146 ⫾ 21 ␮mol/l for gp i and gp ii, respectively.

three patients in gp i had acute rejection at a mean onset
time of 2.9 ⫾ 1.5 months posttransplant compared with four
patients with six episodes of acute rejection in gp ii, of
which the onset time for the first acute rejection was much
earlier at a mean time of 1.9 ⫾ 0.9 months posttransplant.
all rejection episodes responded to 3-day treatment of
intravenous methylprednisolone. gp i patients also had
significantly fewer infectious episodes compared with gp ii
subjects (1 versus 10, p ⫽ .02). one patient in gp i had a
fungal infection and subsequently expired from a ruptured
cerebral mycotic aneurysm. three patients in gp ii had
cmv infection, four had bacterial chest or urinary tract
infections, one had renal tuberculosis, one had skin fungal
infection, and one had severe sepsis and fungemia, which
caused death. one more patient in gp ii died from
hemorrhagic pancreatitis. one patient in gp ii developed
posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease of the gut at 11
months, which improved after surgical removal and reduction of immunosuppression. the renal function of the two
groups were comparable at 1 year with mean serum creatinine values of 130.4 ⫾ 15 versus 168.6 ⫾ 19 ␮mol/l for gp
i and gp ii, respectively. the 1-year patient survival was
89% for gp i and 78% for gp ii (p ⫽ .5). no patient
experienced a side effect from  xxxd286xxx . in conclusions,
 xxxd286xxx  induction therapy plus cyclosporine-based triple
or double therapy was associated with lower morbidity and
mortality rates than a tacrolimus-based regimen in renal
transplant recipients.
